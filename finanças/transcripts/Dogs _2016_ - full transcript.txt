DOGS You let the door open? - Why? - Why... What if someone comes in? Who? Only the heat comes in. Does it bite? People bite more than dogs. But she bites. How is it called? Police. Police, here you go, girl! I'm going to chain it. Are you hungry? My wife's made you stew. If I feed you, Are you going to stop barking? Don't worry, it won't bite you. Unless it gets upset and then it bites you. But it's better for you not to go empty-handed When you leave the house What do you mean? An ax or something... Something. Or a dog, that's good too. The world is full of lunatics. How far does my land go? As far as the eye can see. Your eye 'cause mine is rusty. Was all this his? And now it's yours, son. Where did he get the money to buy this land? Who says he bought it? - What do you mean? - It was his. It was always his. If everything was his, Why that fence? That fence has always been there. Come on, I'll show you the rest. He bought everything in a single year. Les than a year even. Between March ... and December 1983. In nine months. Maybe he had some gold coins saved. Was he a rich farmer? Be careful, the table is unstable. I wonder why the communists didn't touch these properties. - Is there something crooked in the documents? - Not at all. Everything is paid, with the signature of a notary. You don't have to worry. My fee is five percent. Of what? I'll tell you of what. Do you know how many lands do you have there? About 550 hectares. And a hectare is worth what? Seven hundred, eight hundred ... Euros Your buyer Do you think he wants to buy it all? There is no forest or water, it is barren land. Relax, It's not about what's in it. It's because of what's around. Border, the exit to the sea, the Danube. Doesn't he want to grow anything on it? Does it matter? You take your money and I take my fee. What the hell's wrong with her? What are you looking at? The Milky Way? Shut the fuck up, already! See those lights? It's a car. And another one approaches. Maybe they like to fuck under the stars. - Is there any road there? - None. That's your property too, right? Yes, to the border. Something's happening. Police! Shut up! Shut up! What the fuck's this? Don't tell me you haven't seen it before. I 've seen it as soon as I entered the house. Over the kitchen door. A Winchester, caliber 12. Nice piece, right? It's charged? I think so. Shotgun cartridges. Those you use on animals. Let's get closer. What're you doing? Are you afraid? If you don't want to, it's ok. But this is your property. Shoot in the air, ok? ''In order to increase effectiveness and the quality of services provided by the police '' ... That's fine. '' ... the Ministry of Internal affairs suggests suspending the rural police stations '' ... All right... '' ... and its replacement '' by mobile units, that may be requested calling the number 112 of the Emergency Service ... I already told him that I had heard something. But what does it mean, boss? Is it bad? It's bad. Are you able to do two things at the same time? Eat a sandwich while driving? Indeed... On our roads it' not easy. But if they give us one of those automatic cars, I'm ok with it. Do you know what I would like te most to drive? A popemobile. Comfortable, limited speed, to avoid ramming the deer, with bulletproof windows ... And also my mother-in-law couldn't say no more That I don't go to church. I could tell her: '' I already spend ten hours a day in the Papamobile, what else do you want? " '' Five days a week, do the math! '' '' How much do you spend in the church? One hour a week?''. ''Fuck off! '' By the way, how is she? Good very good. Unfortunately, right? - Tell me something... - Good Morning. Hi. Good Morning. How's it going, Terente? Every day worse. The romance? Rather the rheumatism, I suppose. You can't imagine how bad it is. Especially with the clouds. What clouds? It's been a long time since it rained here. Yeah, but I've just seen my daughter in Stoenesti ... There were clouds there? - Why wouldn't there be? - Because it's a clear sky there. Tell me, Terente, What brings you here? What the hell is this? I can't do anything. For the love of God, Mr. veterinarian, don't leave me like this. Why can't you udnerstand? His humerus is broken. This bone here. Destroyed. Why did you go all the way here? I can't help. We came by there and I thought we could take the shortcut. To help the horse, with this heat ... Great, I'll make sure I won't ever need help from you Hi boss. Do you have a moment? Fuck! Whose is it? And the rest? In what condition is it? That's all I have. Terente's dog. He found it in the swamp. On old-man Alecu's spot. Don't touch it. I wouldn't think of touching it. It's starting to get rotten. How many years would you say? Few days ago, It just started to go bad. Did it stay in the the water? It had a sock on it. And it was in a boot. Then it may be older, It takes longer to rot if it's dressed. It still has nails. Nails take a couple of weeks to disappear. And the bites? Do you think it could beTerente's dog? No, they aren't from a dog. Dogs tear, They grind their teeth and tear. These marks are more ... from a chewing of some sort. And with big teeth. Maybe wild hogs. As a working hypothesis, This foot belonged to a man, right? I would say so. It's the same thing that happened with Petrache. He was struck by lightning. His son found him a few days after, somewhere in the field. Only the teeth andhis watch remained of him That's how they identified him. They hogs devoured him, until his bones shined. All right. To continue with the hypothesis, Do you think our man died rather away from here, because If not, someone would've warned us, Then a boar found the body, and devoured him until he was fed up And throws the foot in the lake just to complicate my life? And that? Is it because of the decomposing? Ticks Ticks? Yes, those bugs who live in animals. I know where the ticks live, I wasn't born in Paris. Do you think they bit him while he was alive Or after he was dead already? The swelling means the body reacts to the venom. If he had already been dead, there would have been no reaction. That's my opinion. Mine, too. Tell me one thing. Who says he's dead? What else could he be? Alive. That would simplify everything. I'll just have to find a man Who hops in one leg. Come on, girl! Go get it! See this? Go get it! Bravo...! Police! Police! Do you have a 4x4 A bit old one? A black Jeep, it was my grandfather's. Is it here? I've lent it to someone to go to the village In order to catch the the bus to Bucharest. Why? Apparently, they've found a car like that in a field, but near Tulcea, Not towards the bus station. Near Tulcea? Abandoned next to a field of corn. With the doors open, the keys in contact but not a soul nearby. And Voicu? - Your friend? - He's not my friend, I only know him. I've thought that maybe you could call him. He doesn't answer. It happens. Maybe... it's possible he ran out of gas and walked to the village. Try calling the bus station. How did you meet him? He's helping me sell these lands. Are you thinking of selling the lands of old-man Alecu? I'm not thinking about it, I'm doing it. That's why I came Have you already prepared the papers? This week. What I say doesn't count very much. There's no use denouncing it, I have my hands tied. It's not good speaking ill of the dead, but Alecu led a life a bit hectic. What do you mean? It won't help overwhelming you with the details. What did he do? Did he crush someone's skull? - Don't say those things so lightly. - Lightly? I've seen him hitting a guy in the head With an ax, after an argument. And when he fell to the ground, He cracked his skull. That was a long time ago. - Something horrible to watch for a kid. - So you knew about it. That's what you came to tell me? I've come to talk to you of a man who has disappeared. A while ago, I heard about Of a guy who went hunting lions in Africa. So he's stalking the prey. Suddenly, from the bushes comes out a big lion, with beautiful hair. The man fired But only wounds him and the lion disappears in the bushes. The man waited, the lion appeared again, he fired again and nothing, the lion disappeared into the bushes. They went on like this for a while, the lion appeared and disappeared, and he fired and fired again, increasingly desperate for not getting to kill him. After a while, the lion stopped appearing. He approached the brush to take a look ... and the lion suddenly jumped and killed him. He had shot seventeen lions, Each and one of them in a pool of blood Some dead, some still alive. Now, Alecu's gone, But his men are still here. He kept these lands sterile because he wanted to. Not even the communists could assemble collective farms. And where no one else enters, One can do what he wants. Without accountability to anyone. Not even the police. What are you trying to tell me? That I should leave? Not sell? Why shouldnt you sell? But better go home and let lawyers and notaries Do the work for you. It's not worth staying here living in fear. What makes you think I'm living in fear? If you're smart, Don't be stupid. I wen to the gas station. She's full. Do you want me to take you to the bus stop? No, give me the keys. Don't make that face, son. You aren't suited for places like this. Listen to me, it's better this way. You see, that's how the world works Also among the animals, there are large ones and there are small ones, The little ones have to make a pact with the big ones so that they won't get eaten. Take care of the house, will you? And the dog. I've been here all my life taking care of this house, son. Come again for vacation. And bring your girlfriend. Take care. Don't worry about that kid, surely he'll come back. Hey! Why do you have Voicu's phone? I've asked you a question. Hey! What's with his phone in your pocket? Let go! Aren't you ashamed ...? Where is Voicu? Where is Voicu? Let go! Where is Voicu? Where is Voicu? I just picked up the phone and the money, nothing more! They just scared him a little, He walked! Where is Voicu? I didn't put my hands on him! It wasn't me! Who did it? Who? I don't know, the others! It's better you get in that car and take off, your still young ... Go to hell! Listen? Mr. Guttman? I am Roman, the owner of the lands near Tulcea. Yes, Sebi Voicu's friend. No problem. Voicu is on vacation, that's why I'm calling you. Voicu told me that the amount you agreed upon was... We can still negote, yes. It was... 385,000. Mr. Guttman, the price is 300,000, are you interested? The lands are mine, I decide. Are you interested? This afternoon. Very good, tomorrow then. Yes, I have the papers. We have a deal. Thank you. You're like a cat, Pila. I haven't heard you arrive. Or rather like a dog. Are you a faithful dog? Where's the guy from Bucharest? In the bottom of the swamp? No, boss, Why would he be there? We just gave him a scare, then he went back to his business. What am I going to do with you, Pila? How long have we been speaking? About four years? And what have you done for me during this time? - Boss... - What have you done? Have you done anything for me? I already told you, boss, He does everything in secret, nobody else knows when a shipment arrives or leaves. He puts us in shifts so that we don't get To talk to each other, to become buddies. Do you know what Agent Ana found? on the last control? Exact. Nothing. Pigs He always changes plans Nobody knows what he sends or when. Since Alecu died, He's become more careful. He has eyes at the back of his head. Now you smoke, boss? Whose is it? That one over there is supposed to be A wild hog's bite. But I think that also A domestic pig could do it. And you know who has pigs around here? No one. The swine flu killed everyone. What makes me think that this foot spent some time at your farm. And where is the rest? At the bottom of the swamp ... Or maybe not. - And why not...? - Why don't we drain the swamp? Do you know how long it would take, and how much would it cost? They barely give me money for gasoline. I can't keep on snooping in the papers, boss. If he catches me, I will end up in a shithole. Burried up in concrete. Forget about the papers. I want him for murder. Whose foot is it? I don't know, I swear it. What's he up to? Who are you trafficking with? Boss... You can have fun with me If you want, Pila. But don't waste my time. Not this week, the previous one... - He had a fight with a Russian. - I get it. Arcadie, a guy ... I've heard of him. The young man. Shipments stopped suddenly, and that Arcadie they couldn't find him anywhere. So Samir, who in ten years didn't get a fine for spitting on the street, suddenly drops a guy just for fighting with him? Not only for that. It seems that Arcadie IWanted to change the agreement they had for years. It's all I know. And I didn't see anything, I swear it. If i seen it, you would've found me at the bottom of the swamp too. So, Maybe you should walk with a white stick and with sunglasses on. Boss... - He doesn't allow us to use telephones. - They don't in jail either. It starting to get dark, it's time to go. They keep asking me, you know? What? Why don't you live with us? Why don't we live with you? Because it can't be. Why haven't you called to tell me you were coming? Because I didn't want you to tell me not to come. And I wanted to come. I wouldn't have told you not to come. Yes, you would've. I am telling you no. Hello? How are you? I would like to come to you at the countryside. I miss you. I miss you too. Ok then, I'm coming.. There's nothing here, you'll get bored. You're here. That's enough for me. So, are you finished? Have you solved what you had to solve? It's not mine. Whose is it then? Voicu's. Who? The one who helps me to sell the land. Is he here? No, he's returned to his bussinesses. So, are we alone? Great. I'm going to tie the dog up. Roman? Do you remember that one from last year? Weighed at least 400 kilos. Here it is. Check if it's dead. Is this. Has it bit you? Has it bit you? No. I'm glad, if not, we would have had to shoot you. It's got rabies. Would you accompany us to a barbecue? Boss... Don't you want a steak? I'm not hungry. Pila, make sure this guy doesn't infect anyone Popica! Bring some gas! It's the custom after hunting. To grill some steaks. And get a drink. Do not worry, we won't eat this one. We don't want to wake up tomorrow foaming at the mouth. We have good meat, first quality. Join us, boss. They're hunting customs. Don't forget the slingshot. So you are Alecu's grandson, right? Yes. Alecu was our boss. Great man, Alecu. Hey, guys? Great man, Alecu, right? Great man and great employer. The best employer, Alecu. To Alecu! To Alecu. To Alecu. Take a drink for the old-man. May he rest in peace. Rest in peace. But now that we have no master ... I'm your master. You're our boss, Not our master. Didn't Samir fuck your mother? Then he's your master. Then, I'm his master too. For the new boss. For the new boss. Did the lady arrive well? The lady. I brought her with the car last night. She was hitchhiking. So I brought her to Alecu's house. To your house Is the family going to be brought here? Has something happened to her? No. She's okay. Nothing's happened to her. What the hell, man You fucked up my throat ... - You're too delicate ... - Shut the fuck up, you asshole! Shut it! Leave it, girls! What will our new boss think of us? A drink to your health, boss. You fucked up my throat ... - I fucked you in the throat. - Shut the fuck up or I'll tear your ass! Shut that mouth of yours, You use it more than a whore. Look what he's done to my throat... You fucking ruined my gold necklace too! The one with the four-leaf? The one that gave you good luck with women? My mother gave it to me. Take him on the ground! Yeah, bitch, take him to the ground If you're so tough! What're they doing? One on one. Old-school fighting. They're not joking around... Of course they are, we joke around like that. We fight, we kill each other ... We aren't educated people, so we get bored. Do you like it here? Fresh air, all the space you want ... The city is like being in a cage. I would go crazy there. Yes... Here, if I want to cross the street, I cross the street and that's it. I can't do it in the city. We have to wait for a green light. You can only cross when the green light's on. And you know what I've seen there? Dogs. They cross at the green light, too. So you, a full-grown man have to wait alongside a dog until they let you continue walking. I, a man, equal to a dog? You, with your fucking cities. Hey, play it fair! Popica, give him a yellow card. We'll suspend him for next game. So you like it here. Why do you want to sell it then? The drink blurred your mind a bit, am I right? I like it here, but for a vacation or a weekend, not to live here. Oh, now not to live here ... Well, with these pianist hands, I couldn't even handle silk. I'm gonna sell. I'm sorry. You're sorry? I'm sorry. Why? I know that... What? I've seen the cars meeting at night. I know about Voicu. Epure told me. You don't say. I know about my grandfather. You know what a crazy old man told you. Some bullshit that old fucking cop said. He has just one fart left in him. Fuck him with his cancer! This filthy mongrel didn't move a muscle in front of Alecu. Alecu had him on the payroll for years. That's none of my business. Yes it is, if say you know about it all. You just hit puberty and you know it all. You come from Bucharest, Move some papers around, and suddenly all this is yours and You can do with it what you please. You're wiping your ass with our work. with us that have our thing here. I didn't say that. No... We're just some rednecks. half a brain guys who you can easily manage. A pat on the shoulder, something to get drunk, everyone knows that us rednecks we drink anything ... The lands are mine. Are yours... So, why sell them? Because you don't know what to do with them? If you live with a woman but You don't know how to fuck her Does it means she's yours? Listen... You should do what mr. Epure told you to. If you want to return for a vacation, a weekend with yor girl to have a barbecue with the boys, it's fine. If not, better stay at home. Leave the rest as it is. I... I'm going. Goodbye. Where were you? There was a wild hog with rabies. He attacked me. And? Have you been hunting all night? I got lost Where are you going? Are you going to behave as usual? As usual? As if you were alone. Talk to me, tell me something. Go back home. Sorry? I'm going to Tulcea, to see the notary. Go to the village, There is a bus within an hour. Can you take me there, at least? Tulcea is in that direction. The town is over there. Go back home. I don't want to go. Go back home, Ilinca. We'll talk tonight. Didn't you use to carry a hammer in the car? What? Do you carry a hammer? There's one there. The world's gone mad. It has always been crazy. Do you think he was talking on the phone? What about the police station? They were waiting for our confirmation. But Chief Patru said He only has four men available. But he needs them at the football game. Go back there When they arrive, Take them directly to the farm. And you, boss? How are you, girl? How are you, Police? Yes, girl, yes ... Everything's fine, Police, is everything alright... Can I help you with something? Good Morning. I'm looking for Alecu's grandson, Mr... - Are you looking for Roman? - Exactly. He's not home. Do you know when he'll be coming back? Come back later. I see... Are you his girlfriend? Mr. Roman's girlfriend? Why do you ask? Who are you? I am... One of my men He brought you here yesterday. We work for ... We worked for Mr. Alecu, the grandfather of ... Yes, I know who he was.

Yes, you can return in the afternoon. Ok, thank you! - Police! - It was out. The dog. It must've smelled something ... Police, come home! Police! If you don't mind, Could you give me a glass of water? Here comes the police. The man, not the dog. Isn't it the procedure to first take care of the living, boss? You don't have much left in you, don't you? Two men in a day? Two? Pila was talking on the phone at the wheel. Thank God, I could've been killed too. And this one ... I know nothing. Young people now they think they know how to use their brain, but they don't look around to see how the world works. How can you think if you don't pay attention? Someone from the village told me that last night he saw a young woman at the bus station. Tell me, What man in his right mind could bring his girl to a place like this? You should know better than nobody. 'cause you know... Where's the girl? She's gone. She's gone? Where? She returned home. She had no bussiness here. Is there something that you really fear in this world? I fear God. But he also fears me. Are you going to smoke it? I'm going to look for the boys, There are issues to attend to. Take care. I wish you good health! They say it's the only thing that really matters Do you think I can ...? I haven't had a bite all day. Or is it a test? Do you have any idea what it was called?
