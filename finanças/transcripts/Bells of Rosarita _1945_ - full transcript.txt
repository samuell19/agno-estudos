How many brother? Where's Slim Phillips? Slim Phillips is on the inside. Yeah. Gabby. You old sonofagun. Slim, you old rattlesnake. Doggone Gabby, you haven't changed a bit. You darn tootin' I ain't. And I'm just as full of fight as ever. What are you doing back here? Business. You remember Sue, don't you? Hello Mr. Phillips. Not little Susie Farnum? Yes. Well, you're all grown up. Say, I was terribly sorry about your father. What happened to the circus after he passed away. Well, its in winter quarters now at the ranch. That's one of the reasons we're here, Slim. We need your help. Some place we can go and talk? Of course, right inside. You'll see also Moroccan moments and exotic review participated in by real Moroccan women. That's a not for nothing now folks. Don't be bashful. Step up and get your tickets right now. Of course I remember your father borrowing money from Ripley. But I also remember him paying it back. Well, we can't find no proof it was paid. Unless we do, Sue ain't got no circus, know ranch, know nothin'. What's the matter Unc? Oh hello. Uh, my niece Patty. This is Gabby Whitaker. How do you do, ma'am? Hello. And Sue Farnum. Hello Patty. It's nice knowing you. Same here. Sue's father and I used to be partners. Too bad you didn't stay partners. We wouldn't be in this fix. I've got an idea. Peewee, how'd you like to go to California? California? You mean you might go back with us? Well, if I'm on the right track, we might have a surprise in store for this Mr. Ripley. This show closes here Saturday night anyway. Oh, Unc. California. Movie stars. Cowboys. Palm trees. Miss Sue Farnum? Yes. Telegram Miss. Thank you. Anything important? It's from Bill Ripley. He says he'll meet us at the station. Big hearted ain't he? I've been thinking, Gabby. Maybe you better not tell Ripley why I'm here. I won't. Come to think of it, you didn't even tell me. How you figuring on outsmarting that polecat, Slim? Well, I don't want to get Sue's hopes up until I' m sure. But I think we ought to be able to find that receipt somewhere. You know how Tom Farnum was about business. Probably didn't even have the payment recorded. Next stop Cabrillo. Gee, California's a big place, isn't it Mr. Ripley? You can't even see it all from here. Bandits. All right, cut it. Nice work, boys. Movie cowboy. Why don't the derned idgits look where they're going? Movies? Gee, that was pretty close. Is everybody all right? Oh yes. We're just fine, thank you. Say, yo-you're not Roy Rogers? That's right ma'am. Oh, gee. I think you're wonderful Mr. Rogers. I see all of your pictures. Gee, the way you galloped in there and grabbed those horses. Oh, my gosh. Well, I'm glad nobody's hurt. You know, you never can tell about accidents. Sometimes the shock sets in late. Now, if there's anything I can do, I'd be glad... Thank you Mr. Rogers. If we need you, I'll let you know. Should we go? Oh, gosh. Shake is up Roy. They want to take it again. What do you think of that? I never even got her name. You ne... Oh my, come on or we'll never finish. Gabby, I wonder who put the tent up. I don't know. Well, ah... oh, thanks for the lift, Bill. It's always a pleasure. You going to be with us long Mr. Phillips? Well, I can't say as yet. Well, anyway. I'll see you before you go. You probably will. Well, I'll be seein' ya. Good bye. Bye. Bye. Boys. We're glad to be back. But what is this all about? We've rented the show to a movie outfit. Yeah. They're making a picture right here. Yeah. And we're all working it. And who do you think the star is? Roy Rogers. Yeah, we figured you wouldn't mind. They're paying us pretty good. Gosh. What's the name of the picture? Bells of Rosarita. You ought to see that big Spanish set they built alongside the creek. Ah, them phony movie cowboys, even muscling in on us here. Yeah, but they're paying us enough today. That's why we're rehearsing. We got to get the live scene in the picture. Oh, Gabby. I suppose it's all right. Oh, this is Mr. Phillips and his niece Patty. We'd better do in and clean up. We'll see you later. Come on over and watch us act. Might do that. Bye. All right. In a little bit. That's good. Now move that other reflector over. Get Artie over here will ya? Hurry up. Well, this is a surprise. Hello, Mr. Rogers. Hello Miss ah... That's Sue Farnum. And I'm Patty Philips. Gee, we're glad you met us. I mean, we're glad to meet you. We just came out here to watch. I hope you don't mind. We're tickled to death, glad to have ya. Now, Miss Farnum if you... Come on Roy. Oh, hiya. Hello. Mr. McDonald is yelling... Take it easy, Bob. We're having a barbecue tonight, and it sure would be swell if you could come over. Oh sure. We'll be glad to, won't we Sue? Well, Well, I... That' fine. We'll be expecting you. All right. Roll it. Action. ROY ROGERS: The bride dressed lace with a breath of heaven on her face sweet as an angel from the skies. Her lips hold a smile. But her heart is breaking all the while. And teardrops fill her eyes. The bells of Rosarita keep her secrets for their own. They know she loves another and her heart is his alone. Though time doesn't wait, still perhaps before it is too late, she may find what she's dreaming of. Cut it. That OK boss? All right boys. That's it. Wrap'em up. That's it. Wrap it up. How'd we do, Mr. Rogers? You were all fine, boys. I'm a fan, too, Rogers. That was a good scene. I'll have to see this picture. Well, thanks. I hope you do. By the way, I understand one of your men said you were interested in some ranch property in this neighborhood. Well, I've always wanted a ranch. I thought while I was up here, I'd kind of look around. Well, I'm going to put this place on the market in a couple of weeks. Well, is this your place? Well, practically. I'm going to take it over. Oh, now, now, now Roy. What do you want with a ranch? You... you... you know I'm allergic to horses. And besides, you got a nice place already. Well, in case you're interested. Well, thanks. I'll think if over. Excuse me. Say, what does he mean about selling this place anyway? Gosh, I hope it ain't true. Under a blanket of blue just you and I beneath the stars. Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance the night is ours. Under a blanket of blue let me be thrilled by all your charms. Darling I know my heart will dance within your arms. A summer night magic enthralling me so. Moonlight would be tragic if you weren't here to share it my dear. Covered with heaven above. Let's dream a dream of love for two wrapped in the arms of sweet romance under a blanket of hmm. La da da. La da da do doooo. Bob, you sure can play that guitar. How about a little jitterbugging boy? Come on. You asked for it, Patty. There's nothing like the morning feeling fresh as the dew when you're going where the staters to behold. The cow's are in the meadow and they give me the moo as I go singing down the row. My little dog is tagging right along with my heels. He's so happy that he's hopping like a toad. And I figure he's a prancing because he knows how I feel as I go singing down the road. The sun is grand. My face is tanned. And I'm so carefree and gay. And as I hike, I feel just like the fool kid for a day. And when my day is over, there's a girl I'm to meet. You see but that's another episode. My heart and I are backing up a dream kind of need as I go singing, singing down the road. What happened, Charlie? They got Mr. Phillips. Who were they, Charlie. Well, I didn't get a good look at 'em. But I was coming around the corner just as they was dragging him out of the house. I run after him, but they started shootin'. Come on boys. Somebody's jimmied this one. Same here. Let's get the horses. Get this car started. We'll never catch'em now. We might if we get'em before they reach the highway. Why would anyone want to kidnap my uncle? I don't know, Patty. Well, that's that. We might as well go back and let the sheriff handle it. Yeah, might as well. Well, thanks for trying anyway boys. That's a serious charge, Sue. Bill Ripley ain't exactly the kidnapping type. I didn't say he did it, Sheriff. But he's the only one who had a motive. Well, if it will make you feel any better, I'll have a talk with him. Thank you. Sug, are you sure they didn't get Gabby? Well, when Charlie saw'em they only had Mr. Phillips. If I only had Gabby here to talk to. Gabby. Oh, he's hurt. Bless your heart. I was shot. Oh, they got me. Somebody get a doctor. Look, I'm bleeding to death. Looks to me like strawberry jam. Yeah. Strawberry jam? Well, don't stand there like a bunch of idgits. Get me a handful of crackers. I'll get them critters if it's the last thing I ever do. Better snap it up, Roy. Crews waiting for us. I was just thinking about last night, Bob. There's something funny about those men making off with Phillips. I wonder why they took him. Who knows. Whatever it was, it's none of our business. Well, I'm not sure about that. Hello young fellas. Come on in. Hello. Hi Roy. Hello Jimmy. What can we do for you gentlemen? Oh nothin'. We just heard you were leaving and dropped over to say good by. Well, gee, that's mighty nice of ya. Well, bye Roy. Well, bye. So long Eddie. Bye. Bye Tommy. Good bye. So long fellas. Is there anything else we do for ya? Well, ah... ah... Yeah. We was wonderin' if you'd sing that about Texas before you go. You mean now? Yes Sir. Right now. All right. Get me a guitar, Bob. Gonna build a big fence around Texas. Around Texas, way around Texas. Gonna build big fence around Texas so they can't steal my baby away. She's the lovinest baby around Texas, around Texas, around Texas. And the fellows all know it in Texas. That's the reason I worry each day. That's that lumber piling high, gonna build it to this sky. A big job to do I know, but she's mighty sweet and so. Gonna build a big fence around Texas, around Texas way around Texas. Gonna build a big fence around Texas so they can't steal my baby away. She's got that Texas sunshine in her smile. Thrills the cowboys, kills the cowboys. She's got those Lone Star moonbeams in her eyes. See what I'm up against. My troubles have just commenced. Gonna build a big fence around Texas, around Texas, around Texas. Gonna build a big fence around Texas so they can't steal my baby away. Well, thanks a lot boys. That was fine. So long. Uh-huh. I knew you were up to something. Bye. Good bye. So long fellas. Good bye. What's on your minds boys? Well, we've seen all your pictures, Roy. They're super. Especially that last one. Oh, you mean the one where I come crashing through the roof and I... Yeah, that's the one. That was sure swell when you go out and capture they guy who was trying to take the ranch away from the girl. Boy, if you hadn't a come along, I guess she'd a lost the ranch, wouldn't she? Well, I guess she would all right. Yeah, well, it's been nice seeing you fellas. Now if you'll ah... They're waiting for us downstairs so if you'd... if you'd... We been thinking Roy. Well, come on, out with it, Jimmy. Well, as long as you're already here, we was thinking maybe if you'd help Sue and us, she wouldn't lose her ranch. Just like in the picture. Look, fellas. That's ah... that's just in the picture. It's all make believe. Roy and I are actors. We only saved the ranch because... because the script says so. Now if... Hold it, Bob. You mean that somebody really is trying to take her ranch away from her? The ranch and the circus and everything. Roy, will you please... You boys run on back to the ranch. Bob and I'll come up later. I don't know what we can do for you. But we'll sure try anyway. You mean you'll help? You mean you'll try to do something? Sure. Oh gee, thanks Roy. Boy Roy, thanks a million. See you later, boys. Bye. Bye. Any news from Slim Phillips? I'm sorry Sue, but we've been over every foot of the desert within 10 miles of here. And there isn't a trace of him. Sure beats me how he got swallered up like that. Well, thank you anyway, Roy. I guess there just isn't much anyone can do. Mr. Rogers, I owe you an apology. Kid's told me what you done, and now I know you ain't just a hero on the screen. If you fellers will have me, I'd... I'd kind of like to join up. Well, thanks Gabby. We'd be glad to have ya. You know I'm a rootin' tootin' shootin' cowhand. And my trigger finger is just itching to get even with them varmints. Careful Scotty. You'll tear that canvas. Ah, what's the difference. We won't own it after this week. Is it as bad as that? I'm afraid it is, Roy. Sue, I wish you'd let me... Thank you, Roy. We'll pull through somehow. If these was the good old days, we could hoist the big up anywhere and make money enough to pay off that skunk, Ripley. Well, why don't you? These aren't the good old days. Then we had more than just a tent and a few props. We had a show to go with it, big names, big acts. Say, could you have this tent up in Cabrillo by tomorrow night? What do mean? I mean could you be ready to put on a show, if you had a show, and someone to attract customers? Well, I don't... Gabby, what do you think? You're dern tootin' we could. Well, hold everything. When the circus came to town. All the clowns were tumbling down. The tigers roared. The lions looked bored, and the man in the back yelled whoa. Peanuts! Lemonade! Popcorn and cracker jacks! A prize in each and every pack. Oh, the monkey got away. Grabbed a man by his toupee. The old folks smiled. The kids went wild. And the the man in the back yelled whoa. Peanuts! Lemonade! Popcorn and cracker jacks. A prize in each and every pack. The acrobats gave us a fright. You closed your eyes and held me tight. Someone laughed, we turned to see. The crowd was laughing at you and me. But we didn't even care. When they all began to stare. We hugged and squeezed. The elephant sneezed. And the man in the back yelled whoa. Peanuts! Lemonade! Popcorn and cracker jacks. Prize in each and every pack. When the circus came to town. Hold it Rogers. What's the matter, Sheriff? You're all under arrest, Rogers. I told you there were no circus parades allowed in this town. Oh, but this isn't a circus parade. Then what do you call it? This here is a funeral procession. If you're trying to be funny... Funeral procession? Who's dead? Poor Oscar. Back there in the band wagon. I suppose you've got a burial certificate. Yes Sir. Signed and sealed by the doctor. Everything's in order. A duck? So you see Sheriff, this isn't a circus parade after all. The only reason we were playing this kind of music is because, well, Oscar loved it so well. It was the poor critter's dying wish. He says to me, just 'fore he laid down, Gabby he says, says he, no sad and sorrowful music when I'm gone. I want folks to be happy and gay like. Them was his very words, Tom. Shall... shall we go ahead with the burying ceremony? Think I better wait outside and keep watch? Nobody will be around. They're all up to the circus grounds. It's going to be a sweet job trying to find a receipt in here. Never mind that. Check the trunk. I'll go through the desk. Gabby, that car looks familiar. Kind of looks like the one them fellers used when they snatched Phillips. Hey, somebody's comin'. Hello. Hello there. We was just looking for you. How'd you know we was here? Went up to the circus grounds, and they told us that ah... I see. Hey, Rogers, I was wondering if you're still interested in the place? Heard you were going to leave in a couple days and thought we'd better drop down and... oh, this is Mr. Maxwell. Howdy. Hi. Hello there. As a matter fact, Mr. Ripley, I have been thinking about this ranch. If you've got a couple of minutes, I'd like to talk to you about it. All the time in the world. Well, we're going in the house and pick up a couple of things. Be back in a minute. Go right ahead. Roy, what are you talking about? You're not thinking of... Bob, I've got a hunch they're up to something. When they leave here, they're a cinch to talk about it. And you're going to listen in to what they have to say. How am I going to do that? Get into the back of the car and ride with'em. Roy, you've been seeing too many movies. Now, listen, Bob, I thought you wanted to help. Well, sure I want to help. OK. I'll get'em away from the car. Gabby, you give him a hand. Yeah. The boys are getting their things together. Now, Mr. Ripley, what kind of a deal are you prepared to offer? Well, I hadn't exactly set a price. I'd like to show you around. Well, let's go. Come on. Let me go instead of you, Bob. I'm more fit, I tell you. Oh, now. Roy wouldn't like it, and besides, this is a job for a young man. Well, I'm younger than I look. I got all the fire of flamin' youth. Sorry Gabby. I'm going to have to refuse ya. You can't refuse me. Me? Gabby Whitaker that stopped a herd of stampeding cattle all by myself? There was thousands of 'em comin' right at me. In front of 'em was a wild bull. What do you 'spose I done? What did you do, Gabby? I just stood there, calm-like, and throwed the bull. You thr... I got to... Look, look, I... I... I'll choose ya, fair and square. Now. The one that gets the straw stays here. Look, Roy told me that I had to do it. And I'm going... I'm going to give you the best one. I'm going to give you the first choice. Go ahead. Go on. Man that gets the straw stays? Gee, I didn't realize it was so late. I'm afraid we're going to make it another time. Suppose I get in touch with you in the morning. That'll be fine. All right. Well, Well, see you in the morning then. Thanks for coming over. Don't mention it. Hey, look out. Hiya Boss. Hello Boss. When you got him? He's out in the back tied up. How long we gotta keep this guy here? Until I find the paper I'm looking for. If this Phillips knows where it is, maybe we can make him talk. That's just what I don't want you to do. If he finds out why he was snatched, it'll tie me in with it. I've got to be kept out of this thing, understand? Sure. We understand, but what are you going to do with him after you find what you're looking for. I don't know yet. But all you got to worry about is keeping him here. I'll let you know later. If that's the way you want it. Hey, the car's gone. Must be some crooks around here. Yeah. How do you like that. You mean that all the time you were in the back end of that car, you didn't hear a thing? Well, I could hear the motor roaring I can still hear that dadblamed thing. And you haven't any idea where they took ya? Let him alone, Bob. You had no business letting him go in the first place. I asked you to go. I know, Roy, but... well, we drew straws for it fair and square. Hey, there was one place where there must have been a 20 foot drop. That's where I got this bump on my noggin. I'll bet that was the old dry wash. Yes Sir. That's the way the went. Well, let's go and see if we can pick up their trail. I ought to be able to do it. I can remember ever... ow, bump. Here are their tracks all right. It looks like the tracks fade out here. Say Gabby, do you remember if the car went straight ahead after you came through the wash or did it make a turn? Oh, I couldn't say. I was bouncing around too dern much. Let's see now. I do remember a few minutes later, we must have passed close to a skunk. And I mean close. Pee yuey. That ought to be an easy scent to pick up. Yeah, well let's fan out and see what we can find. Hey Gabby. Here's our spot. Yeah. Critter's been here all right and recently. Here's the tracks again. Hey. Head for that rise yonder. This is it. The old mine shaft around the corner. Why in tarnation didn't I think of that before? Let's leave our horses here and go on foot. There may be trouble. Now we're in for it. It looks like it. I'm going to try a shot through that window just for sign. Hold it Gabby. If Phillips is in there, you might hit him. Well, just can't stand around and see all the shootin' one sided, can we? Well, we're just in time for supper anyway. They got a fire going in there. I was just noticing that. I did that in a picture once. Sit down and stay where you are. Hey, throw some water on that fire before we're all smoked outta here. Get out to that barrel and fill it up. And don't try to get away. We got you covered. Come here, come on. Get a move on. Hold it. It's Phillips. He's goin' for water. Come on. Get in here. You might as well give up fellas. There's 20 men out there. And they've got the place surrounded. We'll choke to death in here. Take their guns, Gabby. You all right, Mr. Phillips? Yeah, now, thanks to you Rogers. Well, what'd you find out? Well, one thing, Lawson and Gorse haven't talked yet. And as far as the sheriff knows, it was just a kidnapping job. I did a little snooping around that circus tent too. Phillips was talking to the girl, and from what I could make out, that receipt you're looking for is in the vault over at the bank. That means they'll be at the bank the first thing in the morning. Unless we ah... Heliah helioh heliah oh. ROY ROGERS AND SONS OF THE PIONEERS: Trail herding cowboy hop on your pony singing ho. Start riding now boy. We'll make San Antony singing ho. Long weary days and the dusty roads of travel. But we'll make the boss pay for all this battle drivin' cattle. Ride hard and carefree, trail herding cowboys singing ho. Keep moving dogies. Time is a wasting singing ho. I'm not impatient, but why don't you hasten singing ho. You ought to know that a certain someone's waitin'. You ought to know that to cast the bait and confiscating.

That's a nice looking brace of guns you got there, Bill. Thank you kindly. The place is packed, and we're still selling tickets. I don't know where we're going to put them all. Well, gee, that's swell. You don't know what this means to me. Maybe after the excitement's all over I can, well, think of some way to tell you how grateful I am. It's nice to be here, Sue. Well, I'm glad Roy asked me. This night's going to be a lot of fun. They've just blown the bank vault. There were about six of them. They shot one of the Sheriff's men and took off cross country. Well, gang, if we were making a picture, right here is where somebody's holler A. Let's go. Gabby, you get the show started, and we'll be back as soon we can. How do you know he'll be back? Come on Gabby. It's time to start the show. They can't leave me behind. Get somebody else to start the show. I'll bring'em back single handed. Oh. Hey, there's a car behind us. They got our front tire. They got the gas tank. Hey look. We haven't a chance. Scatter! Let's take'em boys. They're racing. One to a man. You're gonna do a lot of damage with those blanks. All right. Come on out. We got you covered. Get up on your feet. I'm sorry I had to do that. As a rule, I'm a peace loving man. Get out of here. Here's what I've been looking for. Come on. Get up there on the horse. Get goin'. Looks like everybody got their man. Well, here they are, Sheriff. Well, I'll be doggoned. Say, Roy, this is just like one of your movies. Yeah, Roy, but your pictures always finish with music. Holy mackerel, the show. Come on boys. Sue, I think this is what you've been looking for. Gabby! I knowed blame well that receipt was somewhere. All right, stand by boys. Introducing tonight's biggest attraction, Republic's great western stars. And here they come, Sunset Carson riding Silver, Don Barry riding Cyclone, Bob Livingston riding Shamrock. Allan Lane riding Banner. Wild Bill Elliott riding Thunder. And Roy Rogers riding Trigger.

They know she loves another and her heart is his alone. ROY ROGERS AND DALE EVANS AND SONS OF THE PIONEERS: Though time doesn't wait still perhaps before it is too late, she may find what she's dreaming of. For the bells of Rosarita may ring out amen.
