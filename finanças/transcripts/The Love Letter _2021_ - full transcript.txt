Anybody here? Excuse me. Can you let me out? Where were you, sir? At a reception on the second floor. A reception? Yes. I didn't feel well, so I went to lie down. I guess no one saw me and there's no one left up there. Sorry. Could you let me out? My invitation. I'm not spinning you a line. What's your company? I don't work here, I was a guest. I need to be at work in three hours. I have to get home. It's not just drunkenness, it's more a general attitude. The other night, I picked up a girl. She seemed calm, but said she was plastered. She asked me to drive slowly and stop when she said. She made me stop seven times to throw up. It cost her 35 euros instead of 15. But at least she was polite. If someone pukes in the cab, it's a nightmare. It costs 90 euros to wash the car. You can clean by hand, but you need steam between the seats. And the smell... Excuse me. I've changed my mind. Take me to Rue de Wattignies. Rue de Wattignies? That's across the city. That's right. THE LOVE LETTER What's up? Nothing special. Can I come in? Sure. What? I don't know. You look like shit. Sorry, but... Here. Sorry, you could've had company. If you say so. How long now? A thousand years or two days? It's been 34 days. I'm glad to see you too. How are you? Old questions never get an answer. I heard you from the stairs. You push your voice this early? I was up at 5. Insomnia. Where were you? Thanks. Working a lot? Yes, at home. My neighbours must hate me. I'm psychosomatic. I had to consult for blocked ears. Both at once. They use a camera and you see your eardrums on screen. It's like a cave or a giant honey pot. With all kinds of gloopy sounds inside. Now I'm on antibiotics. When's your next concert? In three weeks, in Epernay. Schumann's lieder. Remember? Like in Brive. It pays well and that's handy. How's your work? Are the money problems sorted? No. Rogissart vanished, not empty-handed, so we're looking for him. He can't have gone far. Is he married? Yes, and? Can I recharge my phone? Still not mended? I can't do it alone. Haven't you got a new bulb? - It's ok, I'll manage. - It's nothing. I saw Chloé going out. You let her go to school alone? No street to cross. She decided and she's stubborn. Does she see her dad? Yeah. Things are calmer. At least we can talk now. It goes to show. Your stuff's on the bed. Maybe I missed something. It's not why you came? I don't care about that. There was no rush. Sorry, I'm expecting a call. This early? Just spit in my face, ok. I'm not up to that. - Nothing better? - No. I've left her, ok. - You told me. - You don't realize. Leave that! I'll do it. Shit! You make me sick. You make me sick too. There's this too. - Didn't I buy you this? - No. I don't want it anyway. It's best not to see each other again. Ever. Hold on. I forgot my phone. No reason to be sad. The worst shit is easy at your age. Your paternalism is a turn-off. Hold on. Leave me, please. Go and never come back. Hello. An espresso to go, please. Excuse me. Do you have a charger for this? Just for five minutes. Thank you. Want your coffee in a real cup? All right. I'll have a quick smoke. Excuse me. Could I do a quick text on my phone? Thank you. Actually, do you have a pen and paper? Thank you. Is Monoprix still being renovated? Is there a sort of bookstore or stationer's nearby? First left, first left. Or first right, first right. Around the block. Excuse me. What's the difference here? These two? That one is 120 grams. The other one is 140. All right. It's by the sheet? I'll take five of these. There. Like this. Five. Maybe I'll cross stuff out... Give me fifteen. Of these. Give me thirty to be sure. Daniel, something came up. Can we do the meeting at 10:15? Give me an Americano. I went to the FDC reception to try to corner him, but no sign of Rogissart. This really stinks. See you later. 10:15, ok. Jesus... Be careful. What's the problem? Shit, he's something else. A pissing contest this early... He's not so bad. Seen my boy? He wasn't in his room. The bathroom. He wears me out. I know. Christian! That's psychotic, right? Who uses so much perfume? Have you paid? Yes, I've paid. I'll sit over here. I mean need, not want. Maybe someone I know doesn't use theirs. I contact family, friends... I ask around. I was about to buy a printer when my aunt bought a laser one and didn't need her old inkjet. I saved nearly 100 euros. I never go to malls as an outing or to shop. I just go for what I need, then I split. Like food. I always eat in. My last restaurant was in the 20th century. And owning your home isn't ideal. If you work out the cost of a loan, insurance and upkeep, renting can be cheaper. Renting, you save money and can invest the difference. I have to go. Sorry, excuse me. It's my treat. Thanks, that's kind. My pleasure. Bye. Goodbye. Thank you. Just a hitch. A hitch, ok. I'll be there by 10:30 at the latest. No news of Rogissart? He'll fuck us over. We won't see him again. What does his brother-in-law say? Seriously, he must know more. I'm not at home, I'm stuck somewhere. No, we don't cancel a thing. We deliver Monday as planned. Perhaps you've heard from your brother-in-law. I just spoke to my partner and things are getting tricky. Could you possibly call me back or stop off at the site if you can. Thank you. Talk to you later. Hi, babe. Already? Where did you park? On the sidewalk. Want a coffee? I'll be done by 10:30. I can't wait. It'll only take five minutes. I'm alone. - I can't go. - It's just a tiny couch. Paulo arrives at 10:30. I can't leave. You're a pain! - There's Boris. - In the kitchen. Excuse me. Do you need a hand? It's ok, thanks. A couch to carry up. It'll take no time. - Don't bother him. - No worries. I need a break. It'll stretch my legs. Really? It bothers me. Don't worry about it. Hello anyway. It's just here. - Help from the front? - Ok. Thanks. And dinner? Hold on. No idea. I may be dead by then. Ginger chicken? Wasting Dad's money again? Speak for yourself, you lazy slob. A lazy slob of a loser at 36! The recession is your fault! They'll grab you and get you off my back! Imagine the world if everyone was like you! Lazy slob! Shut your mouth! Hold on. I'll take the bottom end. - It'll be lighter for you. - Think so? Yes. There. Top or bottom, always a huge debate. Top or bottom. Morning, night, naked, dressed, with tongues or without. You're in shape. Movie kisses without tongues drive me mad. It ruins it for me. Sorry, this is a bit of a trap. How far do we go? Dangerous question. I'm kidding. Just there. Hold on. Here's good. - Here? - Yes. Thank you. Can I ask a rather absurd question? That young woman texting... How does she look? Is she smiling or... grumpy or neutral? Or sad... Or half and half? Or just a bit sad? The question is absurd. - Why? - There is no girl. Are you ok? Sorry, I feel rough. A heart flutter. You weren't dreaming. It seems serious. A little. Let me read your hand. What on earth for? - Don't you trust me? - I do. It's not that. That stuff freaks me out. I don't believe in it. You're very tired. - My hand says that? - Your face does. What do you see? I'll tell you later. What does later mean? When? I can't tell you now. Hold on, you're killing me. Is it bad? Important, say. I've been looking for a guy for two days. Is it to do with that? That's not what you're really seeking. I'm late, I have to go. Don't worry, ok. That's easy to say. Thanks again. What the... What's he doing? Am I disturbing you? Sorry. I must be dreaming. I couldn't help it. It's beautiful. Very impressive. I didn't ask you. Forgive me. Really. Can I offer you a drink to apologize? No. Thank you. I'm going. How much for the two coffees? They're on me. - Thanks. - You must be feeling odd. You read it all? Almost. I saw you writing and couldn't help it. And... You really found it beautiful? Not the first part. That bit bothered me. You don't start a letter like that. Well, a letter... It's more than that. I'd love to know what comes next. That's why the first lines are... That parallel with hell... The blood spatters... It's not very light. I can't help that. The young woman opposite? With the little girl? How did you know? Intuition. She leaps off your page. Maybe the freckles, but not only. Do you know her well? No, she comes now and then. I hear her sing too, when her window's open. It took me a while to realize it was her. The singer and the one who comes in sometimes. Is she such a redhead? Is that drink still going? Sure. What'll it be? Frankly, a beer to clear my hangover. In biology, it's "cellular rebalancing". In French, it's alcoholism. If you take the plunge, taste something incredible. From Apulia. I'll have a decaf. Sorry, I forgot to say hello. He keeps getting to me... Ricard, was it? No, a decaf. I can't digest pastis. Have this back. No rush. Well? Excellent. I redid the shower joints. Think he helped? He says he'll change, but I'm no fool. Some kids are never potty-trained. - A glass of water? - Screw that. You were right. It's a great tool. Quick as lightning. Imagine me with a grinder? And even less that lummox. Can you imagine it? Do you have kids? I have a son. Like you. Tricky, isn't it? All right. Bye. Are you ok? So-so. You're ringing. Her name's Harriet? No. Harriet's my wife. We're separated. I was optimistic when I said 10:30. Noon is more likely. My brother gave me the legal low-down. We can meet directly on the site. I know, I can't help that. - Did Georges call? - Not yet. "Odd"? Why's the schedule here? What can I say, Daniel? I can't talk now. I have to get back to it. I'll get there as fast as I can. See you later. Excuse me, I was thinking... May I make another remark? Yes. Sorry, I don't mean to... No, go ahead. It's good to play blind, but not too blind. I don't understand. Forgive me. Hold on a second. The part about the Côte-d'Or? A bit heavy? Yes. And maybe what follows. I think it's a matter of nuance. Hold back to make the rest stronger. Or it's like both cheese and dessert. Are you serious? You look like I've gutted you. You could say that. Excuse me. Hello? Yes, Georges. For tomorrow: 3 bunches of carrots with tops, 1 box of banana shallots, 1 kilo of baby onions, 1 box of lemons, 4 fennel bulbs, 1 box of new potatoes... Yes. Did you think it was good or... You don't realize. Yes. 4 of chervil, 3 of basil, 3 of coriander, 2 pineapples, 5 mangoes. - You'd written before? - No. I just can't keep it in. - What's your job? - I run a construction firm. How many pages now? Fourteen. You'll give it to her? She isn't back yet. I should reread it calmly. I have to get to work. - What do I owe you? - Are you kidding? Come on... Let me pay for the second glass at least. 4.30. This is a great place. Chicory with ham? Reminds me of my grandpa. I found that bitter as a kid. Yes. But after boiling them, I cook them in light caramel. Butter and sugar. It gets rid of the bitterness. Hello. A table for three? Will this do? Where the hell are you?? I think... I'll eat here quickly. - May I? - Sure. You know, I don't look like a specialist but I read a lot. But it isn't... It isn't a book. Is answering your phone too much to ask? I'm sorry. Really. Yes, Daniel. I can't hear you. Have lunch without me. I'll be there a bit later. Lunch with the insurance guys? Who fixed it, with Rogissart missing? You've got a nerve. Why do everything behind my back? I'm not around, true, but I'm here, ok. Ok, you think I'm erratic. Can't I take two hours off? Lately? Freaky? Even better. I'm not interested in that. You've never taken time off for a breather? Ok, listen to me. Keep them waiting 15 minutes and, above all, don't start without me. Play it tactfully. Lopez could halt work. I trust you, dammit! I'll be right there, ok. Excuse me. I have a crazy request. You may refuse, so I'm ready to insist. What? May I have the keys to your place? Whatever for? Just for now. I'll give them back very shortly. - Why? - I have to see something. C'mon, I let you read my pages. Please... Won't it hurt even more? A3567. Thank you. I can never thank you enough. This is Léa, leave me a message. What was that? - You didn't shut the door? - I didn't? Classical music was a joke at home. We never heard any. You've crossed the line now. The line? You paper rebel. It pays well. Think the paper rebel can afford Paris rents? I'm sick of moving around. Stop, Nino, I don't feel like it. - You don't want to anymore? - It's not that. Come on. Stop gawping. Don't get me mad. Get you mad? You can't make love like that, then vanish. I didn't imagine it. - I have to work. - Answer me! Old questions never get an answer. What's that crap expression? Come on... Feel how hard I am? - Pretty clear. - I'll explode. - That'd be awkward. - It's not funny! I don't want to, ok! I have a ton of work to do. Sing Schumann and I'll go. Grow up, you tyrant! Stop driving me crazy! One song and I'll go. I need space to sing, so move! I don't believe you. What are you forcing me to do? Resisting turns you on. I just want to slap you. Slap me? Go on, try, you airhead. Nino... Stop sulking. I'm not easy, but you're unbearable. I'm sick of the mood swings. That's it? Nino, I'm sorry I slapped you... You're a real pain. Too much is going on. I need clarity. It's vital for me. When did it start? How did you get in? - Why's he here? - Piss off! - Watch it! - Screw you, asshole! - You're sick! - Let me talk to her. - No, let me talk to her. - I'm not talking to either one! - Throw him out! - Piss off! Get out, both of you! I want to be alone, dammit! Get the fuck out! Fucking loser. What? What did you say? Jesus... C'mon, Paulo! I know Léa's problem. - Through men, she's seeking her father. - Bullshit. She is. Carry on and you'll cry for mummy. - What? - Enough! I'll bang your heads together. She got me in such states. States I didn't know. She burned me up. Yeah... I fell for her like crazy. Then I really loved her. I mean that. I hate virile complicity. - Same here. - No way. But her skin... And her little breasts... Really? Could you cut it out. I'm dreaming. What is this? But... - Have we met before? - Of course. I was a stagehand in Aix. You came to see her sing Bartok. You don't recall? I spotted you. Playing the proprietor. I was sure you had to be that guy. - That guy? - The one who'll never leave his wife. Léa was stifling. - So she turned to you? - Yes. But I was with someone. Maybe impossible affairs attract her. If it's too easy, some people can't get it up. Who else was there? - Who else? - There were others? Does it even matter anymore? Your resignation is phony. Not resignation, survival. No hard feelings. All right, gents. Goodbye. Goodbye. - He's a bright spark. - My ass! Dumb jerk. God knows what he thinks... What the hell... Ever seen him with her? Yeah. You never said? Give me a break. He's not wrong. She is a bit young for you. What? What the hell does that mean? What are you saying? I don't care how old she is... That's not what... I know what it's like. You married young, you worked. No time to live. You're just over 40 and don't want to reach 50 in a flash. All life passes in a flash. Ok, I think we've run out of clichés. Know what Jules Renard said? "Old age arrives like winter. You wake to whiteness." Who said, "Bar chat pisses me off"? Sorry, I'm stuck here instead of chasing that guy. - Chasing who now? - No one. A developer who may have robbed me. My partner and I stupidly invested in a project and the guy has a majority share. Rotten to the core. I haven't slept all week. He's got a way to go. What a fucking day. Your wife again? Why don't you answer? Hello? Sorry, forgive me. I was all over the place. Want to meet up tomorrow? Or this weekend? Strasbourg? Where's Lucas? At a friend's for three days. Why didn't you call? I could have had him. I called 14 times. You're a real pain. You should've left a message. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ok. I can be at the Gare de l'Est fast. See you there? If you want. See you later. Setting sail? Yes, for real this time. One last smoke and I'll go. What'll you do with your letter now? Forget it? You did a deal with Rogissart? Why do you mention him? It's not like you. What are you doing with a notorious crook? Crook is a bit much... Have you seen him? Rogissart? - Yes. - No. You look... Tired? Yes, I know. You're on the defensive? I was happy to see you. I was furious for days, but waiting calmed me. I'm sorry. - Ready to order? - Tea, please. What's that? Nothing. A door. Well, almost. Coffee for me. - The shirts in the bag are part of it? - Joined the Gestapo? Thanks a lot. Before I forget... It's not the 27th yet... But it's silly not to give it to you now. A transfer would be simpler. Yes, but I'm changing my bank. - You had something for me? - The notary's papers. Let's go over them. Now? Let me read them and we'll talk after. It has to be before the 5th. And Lucas's school report. Let's see... What's the problem? He's bone idle? No, we talk a lot. As much as possible. But I see the sorrow he feels. It's normal at his age. I'll talk to him. The last two weeks... It's not his age, it's the situation. What's in Strasbourg? Let's not change the subject. Know your son's latest? What? Three days ago, I opened the computer history. I don't check on him, but I try to be vigilant. And... And I found... "Triple sodomy for cum-guzzling slut." What's that? What do you think? - Jesus, he's 11. - Exactly. What did you say? Nothing yet. I'm at a bit of a loss. I should talk to him, but I can't fling his erotic feelings in his face. Erotic is a bit weak. "Cum-guzzling"... I'm not sure he knows "guzzling", but "cum" and "sodomy" are clear enough for him. It's simple. Just say, "That's not what love is." Keep it simple. Simple? Yes, "That's not what love is." All you need to say. Great, you have all the answers. Cut it out. Realize what those kids watch? Yeah... He's good-looking. He changes so fast. So I see. He keeps talking about you. What does he say? He has photos of the construction site on his wall. He's crazy about you, so feels guilty. So, if that's not love, what is? Think he'll ask you that? What if I was asking you? You're stuck now. Seeing someone? - What does that change? - Don't say that. My question stands. - I'm seeing someone a bit. - A bit? Is that love? - You're beautiful. - Stop it. I can't even say that. You scare me. You look exhausted. It's not just because of her. They say you're not well. Who are "they"? I'm saying it. I just need to rest. So take it. See someone or go somewhere. I'm already on my way. What? To the depths of myself. That's beautiful. Spare me, just for a few seconds. I do what I can. It's not easy. But... I'll always be on your side. Don't say that, Harriet. You loathed me. You hated me. The worst part of it is, to make you happy, I know... I'm a world champion. If only you had let me. - I have to go. - Already? Hold on. Shit... What? Where are my keys? Check the floor. Right... Let me walk you to your platform. I'm not big on platforms. Look for your keys. Yeah... Where the hell are you? I'm bored shitless waiting here. I can't even afford a coffee or a paper. When will you get here? The train's in 20 minutes. All I do is wait for you. I'm not your dog. Hello? I'm out of battery. How did it go with Lopez? Hold on. His brother-in-law's calling. I'll call you back. Mr Majoux... I'm free later, but I'm not at the site. I used to forget my keys at parties on purpose. A way to come back and be alone with someone. A programmed Freudian slip. Seen her go out? I don't keep watch, sorry. Seriously... Your pages... You came back to give them to her? I keep thinking about it. You shouldn't. Why not? It'll deprive others of it. Others? Screw others. I'm sure you have something... Hello. Hello, Mr Majoux. You had to cross Paris? No, I wasn't too far away. - Any news? - It's about Rogissart. I'll stop you there. We know each other. May I be frank? I know Rogissart is your brother-in-law. You know him better than I do. But I have a couple of things to say to explain who he is. He spent the last five years submitting tenders, subcontracting, sinking firms, faking sympathy, apologizing for using legal means while lining his pockets... We know who he is now. We were badly advised, partly by you. I could say I feel total disrespect for him, but, rather than beat about the bush, I'll say he's a shit. - Shall we sit down? - I think... To those who excuse him, citing his so-called flamboyance or hypersensitivity, I say, "Screw you!" Screw you. The worst part is that feels good. It's a relief. I feel happy. The guy's a pig and I spit in his face. - Don't bother. - Why not? He killed himself yesterday. They found him in his car earlier. My sister's a widow and my nephews have no father. Anything to add? - Is he dead? - Yes, totally. It happened yesterday? I just said so. And you... How are you dealing with it? Sorry, I know I can't erase what I just said. You can't tell, but I liked Rogissart. I mean... Why not tell me by phone. I couldn't get a word in. Meeting seemed more tactful. We could have moved the meeting. Not really. My brother-in-law was deep in debt. He hadn't told anyone. There's 400,000 missing. We need to move fast. Fucking bitch! I don't really hate anyone. You're lucky. Tell me how you do it. You're no less guilty than others. You're not a bastard but it's worse: you're a cliché. Your emotions cloud your thoughts. We need to calm Lopez and renegotiate. What the hell? Stop! - Let go of me! - Stop it! Let go of me! - Drop the knife! - No! - Drop it! - I feel dizzy... Let go of the knife! Let go of me! Sir... My love! No! No! You're a pain. The king of pains. What time is it? After 6 pm. The doctor says your cardiac and neurological stats are good. So much for your weak heart. Disappointed? Going to tell me what happened? In detail. Well, in detail... He went after his mom with a steak knife. And that's it. Then again, why not? But why were you still there? Where's Chloé? At a neighbour's. I left in a rush. Want some water? I'm hot. - Some water, sir? - Please. Thank you. - Have they seen to you? - Don't worry. My daughter's on her way. She's a vet. She's used to old dogs like me. We know each other so well. But the love is gone. That's what you think. Where are my things? Shit, everything's back there. I have something for you. No, please, I want nothing. Busy this evening? I'm with Chloé. Hold on... - Wait. - No, or I'll never leave. Wait. Stay here. Stay. You're in love with your sorrow, Jonas. There's nothing I can do. Nothing at all. Lucas... - Hi, Dad. - Hi. Just to say I'm thinking of you. How's it going? Is it nice at your friend's? How did you know I'm here? Your mom told me. We need to talk about your report. What have you got for dinner? - Fish and chips. - That's good. Listen... Can't wait to see you. Hello? Sorry, Dad, Ferdinand's waiting to start a game. All right, I'll let you go then. But don't stay up too late. Ok. Lots of love then. Love you. Thinking of you. Bye. Hello, what can I get you? - I need to pick up a bag of stuff. - A bag of stuff? A pink paper bag. A glass of red. Just a second. Good evening. - This one? - Great. Thank you. Out of the hospital? You knew I was there? You're the talk of the neighbourhood. The hero of the day. A shaky hero, yeah. Skipping the show? It's ok, she's here every Thursday. After this day, I need my bed. Got a light? What is someone always looking up thinking? People's thoughts interest you. You had a tough day? Remedial teaching this morning, then a stop at the Gare de l'Est... to put an end to something. I was at the Gare de l'Est too. Then a job interview. Otherwise, I bit my nails. They ask you so much. Having kids bothers them. No kids is fishy... They ask totally private questions and, like an idiot, you answer. Been looking long? Four months. - In what field? - Culture or education. I'm into that. You've changed since earlier. - You listen better. - I do? It's good talking to you. I don't know why. It can take time to see what's happening. For example? You can't see? No... I don't know... We can't know. So many people start at the beginning. Some days you see, others not. I see where you look. - Sorry, but... - Don't apologize. - You've got a nerve. - Why? You ask why. Now I don't see. Ok, I have shopping to do. See you around. I'm put out though. That you find me loose. I never said that. - By the way... - What? What did you read in my hand? I said I'd tell you later. She's mad, totally mad. Excuse me. I need an envelope. A big one. It didn't fit. Thank you so much. Not too tired? No, I'm ok. Is it a girl or a boy? Did you make a copy? Don't, you'll regret it. Keeping it is meaningless. Deep down, all I've written is a goodbye letter. That's the trap. Romantic goodbyes restore the bond. Like quitting drinking or smoking. It's easy, you can do it often. Even if I don't get her back, I'll have tried. What do you expect me to do? Write a sequel? That'd be absurd. - It's not absurd. - It'd be obscene. Who did I write for? The world at large? Maybe just for yourself. It doesn't exist without her. Without your parents, we wouldn't be talking. Ok, I get it. Feeling better? They set you straight? What's your name? Mathieu. And you? Jonas. Delighted, Mathieu. All right... By the way, your friend's funny. - What friend? - Your girlfriend. I carried her couch. Loubna? She's my sister. No, I mean... Your sister? Half-sister, same thing. My girlfriend's in Brussels. The distance is a pain, but meeting up is always good. See you, pal. - You scared me. - Sorry. Could you drop me off? - Where am I heading? - Not going west? - You're pretty presumptuous. - Sorry. All right. Here's an idea. It's been a tough day, so we don't talk on the way. It'll help us rest and we'll see if silence bothers us. The first to speak loses? Deal? What is it? Just a memory. Hey, I read it too. It's not that wild. Subtitles by Ian Burley.
