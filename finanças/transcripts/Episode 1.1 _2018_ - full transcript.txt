Fix your ties, guys. [narrator] The scene is the same as ever... Ready? ...and yet there is something different. The greatest team in Italian football history is assembling, as it has for the last century plus, to take the traditional group photo that will symbolize their unity. C'mon, coach! [narrator] But for the first time ever, everyone will have an opportunity to see more than just this image below the headlines. They'll see more than the matches, with an unprecedented perspective from inside the club. He hurt himself. [narrator] This season, Juventus F.C is inviting the world along to witness its story behind the scenes. Let's get ready to take part in the team's great adventure. [photographer] Look this way. [theme music playing] [commentator] These guys have made history, this is the most beautiful victory of all time! It's the sixth scudetto! This is the black and white legend! Thank you, guys. [narrator] August in Torino, Italy. And the dawn of a new season in the Serie A football league. Three months ago, here in this stadium, Juventus F.C. won both its sixth consecutive Scudetto, and third consecutive Coppa Italia. Both unprecedented feats, in Italian football. But the excitement over both those victories was short-lived, and the team was defeated in the Champions League Final. [commentator] It's tough to lose two finals in three years. It's painful to see supporters crying who, like us, believed in this trophy. [narrator] For Juventus, they use their past to define their future, as they have celebrated dozens of championships over the last century. [commentator] This is a fantastic invasion! It's a celebration, Vialli kisses and raises it to the Roman sky, to the Italian sky, the Champions Cup! Here is the scudetto of the history! An unprecedented achievement! To Juventus! [narrator] So as the season begins, the pressure to meet those expectations is higher than ever. The team begins its season the same as it has for decades, with an exhibition game in the nearby town of Villar Perosa, where the family who have owned the club for over 90 years are from and where its president Andrea Agnelli reminds the players of their unconditional mission. Juventus legends like Sivori, Platini, Del Piero, Baggio... They all walked through this garden and through that pitch. [Allegri] This will be a year extremely, extremely hard and tough. To plan this season around the Champions League would be the wrong thing to do. The season is made out of every given week. Saturday, then Sunday, then Sunday, then Sunday. We will be able to win only if we sacrifice ourselves for one another. Today it is a celebration. Let's enjoy it. Today we are in our home. Enjoy the day, thank you. [narrator] This is the day's main attraction for fans: a free exhibition pitting the club's first-team stars... against younger players from its academy. [Giorgio Chiellini] To play in this small field in the outskirts that experiences this glorious day makes for a moment of unity for everybody involved with the club. With them being the family, the team and fans. In modern football, it's important to keep certain traditions alive. [Gianluigi Buffon] It's a romantic side that survives and we can't let go of it. [Claudio Marchisio] It's a meeting of the extended Juventus family. We make a wish all together, fans and players, to be ready for another great season. [narrator] If the players look at the fans of the club as family members, there's no better proof than today. [Chiellini] The game is becoming shorter and shorter. Because fans display their affection with a very peaceful pitch invasion. [Chiellini] Of course you give out what you wear, and sign autographs as you leave. These are beautiful moments that make you part of this club. [narrator] Maybe a difficult season ahead... but to anyone witnessing this annual spectacle, it's clear that in the culture of Juventus, the supporters are just as much a part of the fabric of the club as any superstar. Go Juve! The greatest champions in the world! [Buffon] If one would ask me, "What is your special talent for being goalkeeper and captain," I would reply that I do nothing special, Juventus has many captains for leadership, for professionalism and for being role models. When we might "fear" the opponent and the event itself, When we play matches that we might doubt the outcome, we manage to be united. The goal here is never to be satisfied of what you do. This is the only rule I know to win and get better and better at it. I want that my teammates, when they play on the pitch, to give their best for the cause. [Buffon] Until the last day I'll play, I want to give all of myself to Juventus on and off the pitch to make sure things go well for Juve. And I hope to have passed on the important values to the ones who will come after me. [narrator] To help strengthen the Juve squad this season the team welcomes the arrival of more champions. Among them Blaise Matuidi, a midfielder acquired from Paris St. Germain. His first press conference as a member of his new club leaves no doubt he's happy to be there. He also understands what he has been brought to Juve to do. [host] Good afternoon and welcome. Please ask one question at a time to facilitate translation. Thank you very much. [Matuidi] I am very happy and very proud to wear the Juventus jersey. I've known Juventus for a long time. It is a great team. They always do well in the Champions League and win the scudetto. So for me, it's a new adventure. It's a challenge, but an exciting one. In any way I will do my best to help the team to achieve its goals. [narrator] Historically, Juventus has always relied upon the strength of its defense. Matuidi may be a midfielder, but he has outstanding defensive qualities. Which will be very important in compensating for the recent departures of some of Juve's best. Move fast to the opposite side! Stay behind and then jump on him! [Massimiliano Allegri] It's not easy, every year we need to raise the bar, and we have to ask a lot more of ourselves. Because at the end, in March, there will be the last part of the season, which is the most important. We'll have to be physically and technically ready, but above all, mentally ready. [narrator] It's night before Juve opens the season, and for Gonzalo Higuain it is a solitary and quiet time. [Gonzalo Higuain] I like my beard and I take care of it every 15 days. Sometimes when you have a beard and you score, you let it grow. These are the initials of my family. Jorge is my father. Nancy is my mother. Nicholas my counselor, my older brother. Federico plays in MLS in Columbus and Lautaro is the smaller. This one says: Juntos somos invencibles-- Together we are invincible. Family is essential, for me is the thing that matters the most. With my family when I am not playing soccer we do not talk about soccer. We talk about other things that are also important in life. My father used to play soccer many years ago and so we grew up in the 'soccer world'. My father is more critical. Even if I score two or three goals, it's hard for him to tell me that I did great. He first talks about what I did wrong and then he remembers that I've scored two or three goals. But also because of that, I have learned to do better. [narrator] After disappointing play in the Champions League final last season, the expectations for Higuain are compounding, increasing the pressure on him for a strong start. [commentator] Brothers and sisters, welcome to Allianz Stadium. [narrator] Juve opens the season at home against Cagliari. It's the first test since conceding three goals in the Super Coppa Italiana over the summer. If Juventus hope to defend their title for unprecedented seventh time, they will need to find new chemistry on defense. [commentator] The ball is well positioned... Goal! Juve scores! [narrator] After Juve's opening goal, a bit of history is made when video review is employed in Serie A game for the first time. The review goes against Juventus, offering Cagliari a chance to draw even. And the first difficult test of the year for Juve's legendary goalkeeper. [commentator] Gigi saves it on his right side! The best keeper in the world defeats the video review! Paulo, left foot... Goal! And the ball goes in. Goal! [Allegri] We have to face a long season. Starting from September 10th we'll play every three days. I am happy about today's performance. Up until the penalty we weren't defending very well. We need to work on that. Buffon was great at saving the penalty, taking the chestnuts out of the fire. [narrator] Juventus always expects a strong start in the serie A. Yet the ultimate goal for this club is to get to the Champions League final. In his first three seasons, head coach Max Allegri has already become the third winningiest coach in Juventus' 120 year history. But the decision on returning for a fourth season was more about the losses than the wins. Go...go...go... After Cardiff I did... I had a moment of reflection, as could be expected, because... because I already achieved two Champions finals in three years. So I had a moment where I stopped and I asked myself if I was still able to have the energy and strength to be able to face another year at Juventus. [Allegri] The difference between Juventus and other teams is that what you achieve is put aside right away, and you immediately have to work hard for the next success. [Allegri] So this is one thing that gives you a lot of pressure. I always say that in football, "Winning is an extraordinary thing, but it is not normal." [Allegri] Outsiders think that it's normal for Juventus to win, but it's absolutely not normal, because you can't win every year. Just like this... Wait...wait...wait. [narrator] If winning has become ubiquitous for Juve so has falling short in the Champions League final game. In nine finals game appearances they have only won twice: in 1985 and 1996. I won one and then we lost two in a row the following years. They are really heavy beatings, because the higher the goal you are trying to achieve, the worse it feels. To get to the Champions League final and lose it... it hurts so much. It's the same for other trophies, but the Champions League hurts so much because it all happens in 90 minutes. It's devastating. [Del Piero] You need some days to breathe and forget about it. So that you can restart a month later all fired up, with the desire that it won't happen again [narrator] The road to this year's Champions League final starts in Monte Carlo, with the stage group draw. [crowd] One captain We only have one captain [narrator] Also part of the evening: Gigi Buffon being honored as last season's Champions League goalkeeper of the year. [Buffon] One must never feel satisfied. Receiving it at the age of 39 is gratifying, but I think I'm deserving of it. When people talk about Buffon player, I want them to talk in the present tense, not past tense. [host] Please welcome on stage the Uefa Champions League goalkeeper of the season: Gianluigi Buffon. [narrator] He looks at ease around fellow superstars, even if they seem eager to remind him of his age. [host] Cristiano, you became the first man to score 100 Champions League goals. If you had to pick one that stands out... The last one against this old man. [narrator] But he appears comfortable with the idea of retirement. Well, I am getting there calmly, in the sense that I am relaxed because I am getting there in a good shape, physically and mentally, which was my first goal. Nothing and nobody is eternal. [narrator] In the opening stage, the four teams in each group play twice. One game at home and one game away. Barcelona. [narrator] Juve draws Barcelona, and will travel to Spain for their first game. [Buffon] Clearly, after all these years, winning the Champions League would be the accomplishment of my dream and of an incredible story I'm having with Juve. [narrator] As the team leaves for Spain to open the Champions League season the recent memory of beating Barca 3-0 in Torino during the last season's quarterfinals is still fresh. Having dominated one of the most prestigious clubs in the world brings added pressure especially for Juve's 23-year-old Argentinian striker Paulo Dybala. His two goal performance that day inflated comparisons to another Argentinian striker: Lionel Messi. Nobody expected what I did last year and now everybody expects what I did last year. [Dybala] It's not easy, because it's hard to play against such a team like Barcelona and in a stadium like this where they will aggress us. [crowd chanting] [Allegri] To achieve a third consecutive game against Barcelona with clean sheet would be extraordinary. Since it's very hard, almost impossible, we'll have to try to score. [commentator] From the Camp Nou in Barcelona, the first Champions League game of this group and it's already an extremely big game. De Sciglio on the edge of the area. De Sciglio! Only few inches out of the target. Dybala towards Ter Stegen! Dybala inside the penalty area. Dybala! Messi shoots against the wall. It's not over. Suarez, Buffon! [narrator] In the opening period, Juve plays strong defense, as they fight to keep their clean sheet streak alive. In the closing minute of the half, Lionel Messi strikes. [commentator] It's a billiard shoot on the far away post. For the first time in his career he scores a goal to Buffon. We're ready for another Barcelona - Juventus 45 minutes battle. One to zero, but 50% of this match still needs to be played. Messi is in the box. It's still him, Messi! The ball is in the middle. Rakitic. Barcelona doubles the score. It just got very difficult for Juve, which needs to get back on track and score a goal as soon as possible. Messi stops and dribbles. Always him, Messi! He makes the difference one more time. What an impressive player. [narrator] In the end, Leo Messi is too much. Barcelona beats Juventus for the first time since the 2014/2015 Champions League Final. [Allegri] We played well in the first half, but we should have kept our heads focused in the second half. We conceded three goals on counter attacks. When you allow a player like Messi chances like that you will lose the game. Keep your head in the game, always! Use your brain! Pay attention! [Giuseppe Marotta] After a defeat, one should always learn lessons. As Nelson Mandela said: "I never lose, I either win or learn." When you receive the pass, play there! [Marotta] In this case we have learned that we must play with unrelenting intensity. This is one of the goals that Allegri, his staff and the entire team must pursue in the coming matches. [Allegri] Why do you go there?! Out, here, close him! Press him! This is the half wing and here the defenders! [Pavel Nedved] Juve doesn't play for second place or to take part, Juve plays to win. I went through it, I know how they feel when things get difficult, because I lived those moments. If we can't stand close, open there! Stay up, Berna! Go there! There is a lot of pressure from people because the team has a huge fanbase where there have been players that really made soccer history. It's very difficult to play for Juventus, only few can manage it. [narrator] When there's so much tradition with a club, the glory of yesterday is connected to the hope of today and players like Claudio Marchisio, who first began his Juventus journey in the youth academy. Here we are. This is where it all started, in 2006. This is the path that you follow when you are young. [Marchisio] Thanks to their coaches, the young begin their growth process. I followed this path too, which made me grow. In simple words I left this message to whom has been able to make it this far. "May this jersey and my story shape your dreams." This is the meeting room. The South Americans usually stick together, they speak Spanish and Portuguese here in their zone. Here we have the Eastern zone with Mario Mandzukic, Khedira, Stephan, me and Pjanic. We are here with these people who work for us all year around, thanks to them we have everything we need. They are very important. [Rosanna] We are preparing for training. [Marchisio] You are preparing for training for... we will train at the Juventus Stadium. Rosanna is here since a long time. We've known each other since a long time, I was as tall as the table. -[Rosanna] It's true. -And then I've grown a little bit. These are our real tools: our shoes, always ready for our battles. -[Marchisio] Thank you. -You are welcome. [narrator] For their fourth match of the serie A season the team is headed to Reggio Emilia for a matchup with Sassuolo. After three straight wins, everyone feels the pressure to continue playing well, but for the one who wears the most coveted number in the game, the expectations can be extreme. [Del Piero] Number ten jersey is a prestigious number, it is the number when it comes to soccer. Also you're in the most winning team in Italy, so it's one more responsibility. A week earlier,  Paulo Dybala witnessed Lionel Messi, the best number ten in the world, pick Juventus apart. Evidence that he still has a lot to prove. [Dybala] To have the chance to play with this number, for all the players who wore this jersey, it is a real pleasure. But for me to play this game with number ten doesn't change things, what matters is to try to perform well, give my best and help my teammates. [commentator] From the Mapei Stadium of Reggio Emilia, good day from Enrico Zambruno, it's the 4th serie A game. Today is Sassuolo versus Juventus. Barcellona, the Camp Nou and the Champions League are already the past. The present is serie A. Till the end, go Juve! Cuadrado can cross. Cuadrado! Ball's out. Forward, Mandzukic tries to be faster than Letschert, inside for Dybala, pay attention... Dybala! Paulo Dybala! A feast for the eyes! Sassulo zero, Juventus one. What a goal! Ball close to the ground, inside for Falcinelli, Buffon! Higuain, good move for Cuadrado. Pay close attention to Cuadrado, ball close to the ground... Dybala! Him again! With a shoot similar to futsal! Kick with the toe on the near post, fourth minute. Sassuolo zero, Juventus two! Ball on the other side, Adjapong zone. Adjapong chest stop. With the tip of the toe! The ball stays there and it's a goal, Sassuolo scores with Politano, who reopens the match. [narrator] Every match has its challenges, on this day for Juve, it's about maintaining focus and composure amid the physical play. [commentator] He manages to pass, Dybala, always him, in the middle of three men. And it's free kick. Tough tackle behind his shoulders, free kick for Juventus. Dybala...! Unstoppable Paulo Dybala! Sassuolo one, Juventus three! What a player, Paulo Dybala! Unstoppable! Unbelievable! [Allegri] The team played a good game, had a good reaction. Higuain helps Paulo a lot he comes out and plays. I am very happy about this, as the whole team is. Paulo gets to score and to have amazing performances because he's supported by a team that allows him to do this. [reporter] How upset are you about the goal? Since you usually get upset... I get upset because it was a game in which we weren't supposed to concede any goals. When you get lead and when the game seems easy you have to keep passing the ball and playing simply, because we need everyone to go all the way, to win a scudetto. We are going to have a photo shoot. [narrator] When you play for one of the world's most popular soccer franchises, there aren't many off days. Today, that means a photo shoot for their title sponsor. What's great about today is that there aren't any traffic cameras, so we can go faster. [narrator] Not surprisingly, the opportunity for a test drive turns into a friendly competition. I'm the best. Szczesny is good competition. I think he's fast. Go slow! No, I can't go slow with this car. [narrator] Being a professional football player is what they all dreamed of doing as boys. But it's just like any other job, it's a matter of finding a balance between family and work. For Miralem Pjanic, during the season in particular, time with his son is something to be cherished. [Miralem Pjanic] What did you do in school? -I ate pasta. -[Pjanic] You ate pasta? -[Pjanic] With what? -Chicken. [Pjanic] What do you want to do? -[child] Play soccer. -Play soccer? -With whom? -[child] With you. [Pjanic] Hey, you let me score. I want to score some goals. I'm very strong in goal. [Pjanic] Yes, you are. You're as good as whom? Like Gigi Buffon. [Pjanic] Like Gigi Buffon? Mamma mia... Bravo, my love. [Pjanic] When my son wakes me up in the morning, he asks, "Dad, are you picking me up from school?" Every time I say yes, even if sometimes, unfortunately, we have practice in the afternoon and I don't have time. -[child] Let's play soccer at home. -[Pjanic] Okay. [Pjanic] Yesterday you broke a vase. Daddy too, he broke everything at home when he was little. Oo-la-la! [Pjanic] I love normal life, I try to live as simply as possible. I have fun. I love spending time with my son. These moments for me are definitely very important. It has always been important for me to have a balance outside my profession, because it's easy to lose the sense of reality, and it's your family that reminds you what life is really about. [narrator] Juventus is not the only serie A team in the city. There is also Torino Football Club. And when they meet, it's always a passionate affair. Torino citizens are more often "Granata". Juve has more fans in Italy than in the city of Torino. [Del Piero] Because it lives through the rivalry with Torino Juve has a good relationship with the city of Torino which has always been a great and glorious team. [Roberto Bettega] The Torino derby, or "derby della mole", always had its appeal and rivalry. Juventus has always been more focused on winning the championship than the derby. For Torino the derby was more important. [crowd] Torino is just us! [narrator] This traditional meeting of Torino's two football clubs is always for a romantic celebration. On this day, it's all Juventus on the pitch. The final touch in extra time, Paulo Dybala's second goal of the game and tenth in his last six matches. It's a signature win of this early season and takes the club's record to a perfect 6-0 in serie A. But even amid the celebration, everybody knows that this is only the beginning. The season has seven long months ahead and there are many unanswered questions. All in the Juventus family have come to expect more wins like this one. But nothing is for certain, in the game of football.
