Don't you wanna know my name? What's your name? Robert. Well, Robert, usually, we'd be naked by now, but since neither of us are taking our clothes off, what do you want? Just to talk. What do you want to talk about? It doesn't matter, just start talking. I'm not much of a talker. Are you loved? Yes. By whom? By my honey bunny. She loves me. - You're a mother? - Yes. And, a whore? I have two jobs. One doesn't pay so well. Ask me if I'm loved. Are you loved? Have you ever felt like you were meant to die a long time ago, but somehow, you cheated death? No. Well, I shouldn't be here. All I do is hurt things, and sometimes, just to see if I feel anything, and I don't, not ever, and that's how I know I'm not supposed to be here. I think you need someone, but more knowledgeable to talk to than me. Like you. You're here with me. I bet your heart is racing right now. Oh, and I'd see you thinking, "How quickly can I get to the door before he stops me?" All of that that you're feeling, you wanna know what I'm feeling? I'm feeling nothing. This was a mistake. - Mistake? - Yes, yes. There's no such thing. I don't know what's waiting for me, everything that I've done. I just wanna go home. But I can't go alone. Nothing. There you are. Where am I? Home. This is a way to give back. There's so much to be done, Francesca. There you are. Hi, honey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. They'll come home. She knew if this duck was ever going to survive, she would have to help him. She named the duckling Time, because she knew that's what it would take to teach him how to fly. Time wanted to give up many times, but she refused to let him. "You were put on this earth to fly, "and fly you will," she told him. So, Time marched on, and she kept trying. All interviewees, please report to the correct designated room indicated on your red invitation card. Thank you. Three helpful tips to conduct a successful interview: always remember to be honest, be yourself, and most importantly, don't forget to smile. Please have a seat. Your interview wait time is approximately 47 minutes. Did the interviews start yet? And I didn't know I could speak English. Which one do you wanna sleep with? The duck. The duck. Okay, sweetheart. There you go, honey. ♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪ Sir will see you now. This job requires a lot of travel, and I see here you have not done any traveling at all, Francesca. I've been through a lot. And do you think life was meant to be difficult or life was meant to be easy? I haven't met anyone that would say life is easy. Is your actual name Sir? So, you think life is meant to be difficult? Easy or hard, it doesn't really matter. You're writing that down? I am. And, you think because I haven't traveled much, it's a disadvantage. Is it not? I don't think I have to leave to see the world. I mean, I've encountered every kind of man, woman, too. In my line of work, the world came to me, and that world isn't very pretty. I read that in your file. You know what? Not everything in there's 100% accurate. There are two sides to every story. Oh, and what certain story are you referring to? All of them. What is it that you think we do here? Something about transitioning. Mm hmm. It involves helping people, and I'd be good at that. I've helped a lot of people. Well, and I think you can help a lot of people, and you do definitely have that advantage over other applicants, but in every other field, you are by far the least qualified person I have seen today. I'm the least qualified in everything I do. So, why should I consider you? Because I won't quit. Ah, and you think that all the other applicants will quit? Well, there's an opening. Somebody didn't do their job. Why are you really here? - I told you. - No, you didn't. Honesty is very important here. Well, if you already know why I'm here, why do I have to say it? If I were to consider you for this job, you can't see her. Do you understand that? Not yet, but if I do a good job, then I can see her? That's true, but... That's why I will get the job done. I will do whatever it takes. I need to see my little girl. One last question. You're in a desert, and there's a turtle on its back dying. Do you blame the turtle for putting himself in this position? Do you blame the desert for setting the scene of its death, or is it the sun for causing its death? That's a stupid question. is that your answer? No, the answer is there's no answer, because the turtle doesn't die. If I'm in the desert, I don't blame someone. I just flip the fucker over. Done. Random or not, I intervene. But the turtle is still in the desert. Well, it found a way in. It could find a way out. Like you in my office. Good day, Francesca. Can I ask you a question? What is your question? How is she? She's a bright little girl with a bright future. That's all I can say at this point. Why do you insist that we meet down here? I work down here, and it keeps me fresh. I don't get that lost, puppy dog look. I do not have a lost, puppy dog look. Well, you do, but that's why I'm here, so I can do the dirty work, and you can hand over a folder, so... Francesca, your way of getting things done have many concerned. Do I get the job done? Yes. Faster and more effective than anyone else in the region? No one is questioning your record. I am talking about your methods. If I was a man, you'd be calling me James Bond. I was just told to suggest to you that perhaps the sexual acts could be kept to a minimum. It's like telling the ocean to dry off. It's not gonna happen. Men... Really, a dollar? I gotta get a new job. Thank you. So, where am I going? Reno. It's a double-double. The agent who was on this failed, so if you want the job, it's yours. Yes. Remember to not get emotionally attached. - Just physically. - No. I'm being serious. - You do this, and... - I can see her? I'm not making any promises, but this job does end in Los Angeles. I just wanna see her face. Focus on the job first, and then we'll talk.

Even though Michael James Lamina's time on this earth was cut short, the imprint he left upon each of our lives is lasting and deeply felt. He may have been outwardly soft-spoken, but those of us who knew him can attest to a bounty of spirit and generosity that is exceedingly rare to this world. Tragedy, right? What the fuck are you doing here? What are you talking about? Leave, Caleb. You shouldn't be here. I'm not leaving. Thank you for coming, Caleb. Michael would have appreciated you being here. Rachel. Let her go. Thank you. I'm so sorry. You know, these fuckin' suck, dude. I didn't know him that well. I can say I worked with him for a little bit, seemed nice, though. Michael was nice, yeah. It's crazy, right? I mean, one minute, you're driving along, like any other day, and then bam. Lights out. You're fucking dead. How do you know him? I'm his wife. Oh, fuck me. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's okay. No, I shouldn't have said that. It's fucking weird. I shouldn't have said the "Bam." I'm fine. Can I get you anything? Yeah, actually, some water. - Okay. - Yeah. I'll be back. - Yeah. - I know how you feel. Excuse me. I'm gonna be in the bathroom for a little bit, okay? No, why? The dead guy's wife, she's havin' a meltdown. I'll take care of her. She's my friend. No, it's okay. I got it. I just came out to get her some water. - I don't mind. - Just let her go. She's a bartender. She's great with depressed people. Just remember I need the car later on. I work at three. I know. I gotta drop you off, 'cause I gotta pick up Freddie at four. Remember? Okay, well, if I'm not out in 30 minutes, I'll find a ride. 30 minutes? Okay, sure. Your wife? Fiancé. Hello? Fuckin' sucks, right? What? That dude, Michael. I didn't really know him, but to die like that. I wonder if he felt it. Well, I hope not. Well, I hope not, too, but you gotta wonder, right? His poor wife, man. Don't feel too bad for her. Are you kidding? Her husband just died. I know, but she wasn't exactly known for being the best wife. So the fuck what? Look, what I'm saying is she won't be hurting for male attention, because when they were married, she wasn't hurting for it either. You're saying she was having an affair? Yeah. With who? Remember the guy that I was talkin' to when you came to get a water for her? No. Yeah. That's not funny. Someone died. It's still a tragedy. Yeah, I know, I'm just sayin', she's no angel, all right? Maybe she had her reasons, I mean, we don't know what their lives were like. She had a reason to cheat? What's a reason to fuck someone else? Oh, no. Oh, no, no, what's a reason to fuck someone else? That is not what I meant, and you know it. Come on, come on. I want you to tell me, right, we're gettin' married in a week, so I'd love to know what validates someone to have an affair. You're being an asshole. I'm being an asshole? Fuck you. What if I make you upset or spend too much time at work? So, then it's okay for you to go and have an affair? Can we just be sad for a second that someone died and not make it about you? Can we do that? It's just great to know that some affairs are a-okay. Come on, man. I don't even know why we're fighting right now. Because you find nothing wrong with the fact that... Of course it's wrong, okay? All I said was that it's fuckin' sad that her husband died. You know what? I'm not talkin' to you anymore. Good. - Just drop me off. - Okay.

Huh? Because he's dead? Come on, baby. It's not our fault he died. Yes it is. We did this. We wanted him gone, remember? Out of the picture so we could be together, not dead. We're horrible. Hey. And what? - Come on. - You come here? Why? To fuck me, Caleb? - Don't. - He ain't comin' home, right? He won't catch us. Hey, hey, don't say that, okay? No more sneaking behind his back. - Hey, stop. - You want me all to yourself. That's what you always wanted, huh? Stop. That's what you always wanted. - Stop! - Stop what? Stop this! I don't know whatever the fuck this is, okay? Stop it. Black paintings, whatever this is, just stop. You're killing the animals. I don't want you to go through this alone. That's it, honey, okay? - Can we just... - I hate you. I love you. Don't say that. - I hate everything about us. - That's not true. - Everything about us. - Come on. Michael trusted you. Fuck, what do you want me to do? I'll do it, tell me. What do you want me to do? You're glad he's dead. How can you fucking say that? You are, and maybe, somewhere I am, too. - That's not true. - And I hate myself for that. - I hate myself for that. - Don't say that. We loved Michael. WE loved him, and he loved us. He didn't know about us. Yeah, I know that, and that we have to live with for the rest of our lives, but it doesn't change how I feel about you. Rachel, just look at me. Hey. You know what cuts my insides up the most? It's that the best memories I had while being married to him weren't with him. They were with you. You ruined my memories. You ruined my memories! You ruined everything. Hey, that doesn't fuckin' make sense. You lost Michael, not me, so don't shut me out. Leave. Leave or I'll call the police. Call the police, fuck it, I don't care. Oh yeah? You wanna call the police, go ahead, call the police. Okay, I'll call the fuckin' police. If that's how I get to talk to you, then call them. Fuck it. I don't care who's listening. You know what I'll do? I'll call Eileen. I'll tell Eileen that her son's best friend was secretly fucking his wife. That will kill her. Is that what you want now? Is that what you want, to hurt someone? Why not? I hurt. Hey. And I'm horrible just like you. Don't say that. Give me the phone. Leave. - Come on. - I'm dialing. I'm done. Okay, fine, you win. I'll leave. And don't ever come back here. Whatever we had, it's dead, just like Michael and all these fucking animals. I love you, Rachel. Fuck. Come in. You can set that anywhere. Look at this place. You're all domesticated now. I know. We even use coasters. Can you believe it? Damn. Well, where is she? She's at work. I'm startin' to believe she might not be real. People do that, you know, make up girlfriends, so they don't get all lonely and shit. Come on, you've seen pictures. You know she's real. Photoshop, bro. For all I know, she's really a cat. Here, kitty, kitty. 20 minutes off the plane, and you're already searchin' for pussy. Come on. I gotta get my ass in the shower, first. I smell like a fat Texan. You seriously gonna make me drink alone? The guy I sat next to actually had bacon strips for a snack. Well, did you see who did it? No, it was like a drive by. They just unloaded on us, like dun dun dun dun dun. It's not funny. I'm sorry. It's funny. It's a little funny. Do you think that's funny? I wasn't listening. I got egged. Somebody egged me. Is that funny or not funny? Yeah, see, not funny. Okay, okay, I will get you a new shirt, but you're gonna have to wait until I'm off. No, no, no, I'm working. I gotta go back right now. Then, the yolk's on you. Again, not funny. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just can't use my discount until I'm clocked outta here. Okay, I guess I'll just have to work these eggs into my set somehow. Yeah, egg-zactly. All right, omelet you get back to work. Hey, there's that big polar bear I love. - Come here. - All right. See you at home. - Love you. See you. - Bye. Sorry, I can help you now. I wanna sell all of this. Okay, cool, have you been here before? No. All right, so how it works... I know how it works. Just give me whatever you can for this. Right on. Nice jacket, but paint stains. Can we just get this done? You cleaning out your closets? You know, after a breakup, emotions are usually soaring. Maybe you wanna hold onto a few of his things, in case things get better. He's probably gonna be pretty pissed off when he finds out all his clothes are gone. He's not gonna find out. Oh. Okay. Well, then in that case, I am going to keep this shirt for my boyfriend.

You want me to hook up with your fiance? No, no, I mean, well, I want you to try to hook up with my fiance. You know, most guys would frown on their friends goin' after their girl, right? I know, Freddie, but listen, you know, you got a way with girls, okay? They love you. So, she turns you down, then I know for sure that she'd never cheat. You're just trippin' right now. That's just normal. It's cold feet. That's all it is. No, no, no, no. I'm not trippin', okay? I'm perfectly aware what I'm asking, all right? I've been thinkin' about this for a long time. So, don't chalk it up to me bein' scared, 'cause I'm not scared. Luke, do you realize what you're asking me to do right now? Will you do it? No, for many reasons. One, because it's fucking stupid. Two, because if me and her did hit it off, you'd not only hate her. You'd hate me, too. And three, because I'm going to your wedding. It might be a bit awkward when she sees me standin' by you on the happiest day of her life. Okay. I forget what one was, but two, I wouldn't hate you. I swear to God. I wouldn't even hate her, I'd just know that she wasn't the one. Three, if she does it, then the wedding's off, okay? Problem solved. Can't you ask someone else to do it? She knows all my friends, and besides, look at you, Freddie. I mean, you're a specimen. You're carved from stone. That's why you invited me here, isn't it? - No. - It is. - No. - It is, you fucker! You know, I'll admit, I was a bit surprised when you invited me, because we're not exactly close anymore, but now it all makes sense. I got no one else to ask, okay? And I can see why, you just use people. Use people? Fuck you. All right? You should be flattered. This is my life we're talkin' about. I'm not doin' this. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, hey, you owe me, okay? You owe me. I need you to do this for me. Luke, this won't solve anything. No matter how it turns out, it's bad on all sides. I don't need your opinion, I just need you to do one thing, and then you can fuck off back to New York and do whatever the fuck it is that you do all day long. Look, I love her. I'm gonna marry this girl, and I'm askin' you. I'm begging you, man to man, okay? As a friend, can you please step up to the plate and just help me with this one thing? This is the only thing I've ever asked. You really need this? Please. Get in. I'm gonna walk. Get in. ♪ If I'm lost at sea ♪ ♪ Floating helplessly ♪ ♪ Will you be the ship ♪ that can rescue me ♪ I need to ask you a question. What is it? The man that took me, what happened to him? He had no right to take you. That doesn't answer my question. ♪ Please tell me what you're thinking of ♪ He was dealt with. ♪ You'll know when you see me ♪ Then, how was he able to do it? People make their own choices and do awful things. Sometimes, innocent people suffer from those choices. Why wasn't I saved? I'm about to prevent a death. That is my job. Why wasn't my death prevented? We tried. Do you know how many people die every day? - How many? - 150,000, every day. For some of them, it's their time, and for some innocent people like you, it's not. It is a difficult job we're doing in a very complicated world. I wish we could have saved you, save people like you, but we can't save 'em all. So, it wasn't my time? No, but yes, it still happens. And it isn't Rachel's time, but if I fail, she dies? If you fail, yes. She will die. Is that why you wanted to walk, questioning your job? She wants to die. Why can't I save someone that wants to live? We cannot do that. We can only influence, offer another option. That's all. Right now, Rachel doesn't see another option. That's why you are here. We're here. Who are you? You know who I am. No, I don't. What are you doing in my house? You called me. Layla from the matches? That's right. How did you find me? It's what I do. I find people who are lost. I don't even know what that means. Please leave. I'm not leaving, Rachel. We still have unfinished business together. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. After all, it was you who called me. What do you want? Nothing. I just saw your number on a pack of matches, and I was curious to know how you knew Michael. Michael, such a quiet man. May I? Where was I? How you knew Michael. Oh, that's right. Well, we spent his last night on earth together. - Excuse me? - We spent his last night... No, I heard what you said, but you're gonna have to elaborate on that. You want details? Yes. Are you sure? I can be quite descriptive. Tell me. Okay. We met at a bar, and then took me back to his hotel room. I took him. You know Michael, he could be rather flat-footed when it comes to making decisions. Go on. After that, we had amazing sex. You want positions? You know I'm his wife, right? Of course, I do. After we had sex, he told me all about you. So, you come here to tell me you fucked my husband? Why? Why would someone do that? You know how cruel that is? He's dead. If it's so cruel, why don't you look sad about it? What do you mean? Look at your face. You look relieved, happy almost. You think I'm happy he's dead? No, I think you're happy he fucked me. You're insane. Eyes don't lie. You're even happy I'm here, aren't you? - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. Why? You know nothing about me. I know some things about you. Michael understood why you were doing what you were doing. He wasn't even mad. He just wanted you to be happy. Bullshit. He didn't know. He told me you were the best person he ever met, how you even love bugs. He told me how you'd wake him up in the middle of the night to catch a spider and put it outside. "Most girls would squash them," he said, "but not Rachel." Did he really know? Yes. He knew he lost you a long time ago. He just didn't know how to let you go. And he wasn't mad? Why not? He was too busy being mad at everything else. The thought of someone making you happy again was nice. Did he die on purpose? - I mean, did he... - No. Unfortunately, it was his time. But, at least he went happy. I don't remember the last time I saw him happy. What he wanted most for you was for you to be happy. I know he's not here, but you still are, Rachel. But, he should be, too. In a way, he kind of is still here. How? I've seen this before. In fact, it's happened to me once. Seen what? Have you been vomiting lately? My husband just died. And have you been feeling ill in the mornings? My husband just died. No more smoking for you. Excuse me? You are pregnant. No, I'm hungover and I took too many pills. No more drinking for you, either. No, I'm not pregnant. You are, and this stupid little letter you were planning on leaving behind, I'm gonna take that, too. How did you know about that? It's written all over your face, but you can't clock out just yet. You're about to be a mommy. I can't see you. Something is wrong. The pills, I took too many. It's not the pills. That's just you deciding to live again. Only people who are about to die can see me. What? I'm so fucked up. It was a pleasure working with you, Rachel. What are you? I'm a mommy, too. So, do you make good money at this gig? I wouldn't say good money, but the hours are good. Gives me all day to get my shit done. What kinda shit you need gettin' done? I'm tryin' to be a singer. Oh, you don't do rap, do you? No. I mean, I wish I did, but my mouth doesn't move that fast, so. Well, let's hear it. Blow them pipes. Maybe another time. Oh, well. Time, that's somethin' I don't have much of. Well, then I think you're ready. Man up. A girl needs a father in her life, even if it's only for a few, fleeting moments. And if she gets a brother out of it, too, then she scored. Okay. I'm gonna do it, monster or not. You're playin' the good guy in the end. That's all that matters. I hope you get everything you want.

'Cause I had a really shitty start to my day, but the last hour was quite nice. So nice, in fact, that I was a little sad. How does somethin' nice make someone sad? Banana! Banana! Banana! You haven't seen my Banana run by here, have you? Excuse me? She's my dog. I lost my dog. There, I said it. No, but the fact that I haven't seen her is a good thing. Trust me. You look like you lost something, too. Are you okay? Did you lose your cat? I lost something else. Are you okay? I'll be great when she's back in my arms. No, I mean, are you feeling okay, physically? Never better. Maybe I can help you find what you're looking for. Maybe I just feel a little lost right now. I know what you mean. The truth is maybe we're all a bit lost, aren't we? It's like the boats out there, searching for the shore. What's your name? Francesca. What's yours? Emma. Well, Francesca, it was a delight meeting you, but I should continue my search now. I hope you find what you're looking for. Thank you. Well, your boyfriend sounds like a total fuck-face. Aren't you the one who's supposed to be complaining about life here, not me? Well, I now know why your day started off so shitty, but I still don't know the nice part. Well, before you came in my bar and broke everything, I was chattin' with this old man. He had a real nasty cough. He said he was dying. That's sad, right? That's not the nice part, is it? No, he took a bus from Reno to come visit his daughter. He's never met her before. Hmm, one of those guys. Yeah, he was in here to muster up the balls to actually go through with it. He said that he'd taken the trip, like a half a dozen times, but never actually did it. It's kinda sad, but nice, right? Stories from the bar, they get deep. Occupational hazard. I'm either an ass to grab or a shoulder to cry on. Well, do I get to choose? No, but seriously, that's nice, and it won't be sad if he actually goes through with it. So, all is well. Yeah, but I feel a little guilty. Why? I lied to him. I lied to a sick, dying old man. Well, a lot of people lie. It's normal. Yeah, but I lied to make him feel worse. Do you think that's cruel? It depends. What was the lie? I told him my dad was my everything. Is he not? I never met my dad, but I don't want that old guy feeling like what he did was normal, you know? I wanted him to feel guilty, horrible even, so he'd go through with it this time. Sounds like a good lie in my book. What about you, Johnny? Got any sob stories to spill? Me? I'm like a brick wall when it comes to mushy stuff. Well, sooner or later, every wall crumbles like cookies. Crumbles like cookies, huh? Is there a smoking patio or something, where I can? Holy shit, look at you. You have some deep-rooted issues. What are you talkin' about? For a sliver of vulnerability, you make a mad dash for the exit. You can come with me. I don't smoke. Then, keep me company. I'm manning the fort. Actually, hold on. Can I take my 15? What? I don't care. All right, let's go. Oh, come on. What was up with that girl that was like, screaming? Hey, guys, we got $86. Thanks, see you guys tomorrow. Good job today. Hey, I think we convinced at least two people today. Yes! Answer your fucking phone. Answer your fucking phone. So, it's that kinda smoke break, is it? Bartender requirement, gotta bring light to the darkness. Where's your cigarette? That's cute. My gateway drug to the patch. No, it's good. I can't smoke a real one. It's bad for my vocal chords. I could tell you were a singer. Really? How so? I heard singin' to yourself earlier at the bar. - You were watching me? - I was. Well, Johnny, let's build a window into that impenetrable wall of yours. This is where my cookie crumbles, all right. What do you wanna know? Anything. You got like 14 minutes to wow me. Oh, well, I live in New York. Wow. I already wowed you. You were easy. No, I just love New York. I've always wanted to live there. - You should. - Oh, should I? Why not? L.A.'s fucking nuts, plus we have these things called seasons. I think you might like 'em. What do you do in New York? I program apps. What kind of apps? All kinds. Right now, I'm workin' on an app that, well, let's say you lose your dog or cat, you can turn on the app, and it will locate it. Well, they have to buy a microchip, but I think it will be pretty big once people catch on. So, it's like a GPS for your pet? Exactly like that. Look at you, saving the world one pet at a time. I just lost a few pets growin' up, and I haven't quite gotten over it yet. Me, too. My first broken heart was Wolfie. I swore I'd never love again. Did you ever love again? Not like my first. So, how long are you in town for? I don't know. I might be leaving really soon. I think I broke your cigarette thingy. What? Why are you really here, Johnny? Just visiting. A friend, a girlfriend, boyfriend? - I'm sensing a bit of... - Hostility? Yeah, kinda. What's with the sudden interrogation? You tell me. Why would I be acting a little bit suspicious right now? Let's start over. Can we do that? You knew I was getting married. Oh, to fuck-face. I didn't know that. Congratulations to that, I think. I'm gonna give you one last chance to be honest with me. Another lie, I walk. Please, don't walk. Then, don't lie to me. I have to lie. You lied to that old man because you had to. I didn't have to. I chose to, so choose. Okay. My name's not Johnny. How did you know? I can connect the dots, and when you said you made apps, I knew for sure. I was against this, I swear. He dumped this shit on me the second I got to your place. Are you really playing the victim right now? I'm just sayin' this all his plan, not mine. You know what, Johnny? Whoever you are, it was almost nice to meet you. Wait, please, just don't walk away. What was the plan? Tell me. Come here, talk to you, hit on you, see how you'd react. I wasn't even gonna talk to you when I got here. I was just gonna leave, but then I spilled that drink. I don't know. Why didn't you just keep walking? I don't know. I saw you, and I made a mistake. I talked. You talked. Let me get this straight. You came here to charm me into bed, so what, you could tell him I cheated, so he doesn't have to marry me? I have no idea, but I know you deserve better. Do I? Do I deserve someone like you? No, better than me, too. I'm sorry. When you said that you knew that I was a singer, was that the truth, or was that a lie, too? I swear, I don't remember Luke ever telling me you sang. Were you really gonna do it? Go home with you? Fuck, no. No, marry Luke. I don't know, probably. Don't. That's not your call. So? So, what? So, do what you came to do. I don't even know what that means. You came here to see if I'd go through with it, right? Now's your chance to find out. I don't wanna find out. So, it was all bullshit. No, I don't wanna find out, because I like you. No, you don't. I think I do, and if I'm right, I don't want this to be how we met. This is how we met. We can't change that. I know. So, what do we do now? We either step forward, or we step back. I want to, but I can't. Why, because you think these feelings might be real? Real feeling are bad? What, fake feelings get the girl? How fucked up is that? It felt real the moment I saw you. Then, do it. Take a step forward if you really want to, no more lies. What are we doing? We're getting closer. That's what people do. This is to get back at Luke, isn't it? Maybe, or maybe this has nothing to do with him. I think my 15 minutes... Freddie, what the... Can I help you? Does Ryan live here? Who are you? I'm... Who are you, old man? Come on. God damn it. You wreak of liquor, man. How do you know Ryan? Does she live here? You follow her home, you pervert? No, I... Are you stalking my fiance? I just wanna meet her. Is she here? What the fuck is this? A present, you bring her a present? You tryin' to be her sugar daddy, is that what you're doin'? Get the fuck off my property, before I... What the fuck? Oh, shit. Hey, there sugar love. I know you're still workin', but don't stop and eat on your way home, 'cause I'm cookin' dinner tonight. All right, that's it. I love ya.

Freddie, why the fuck are you holding her hand? Man, I know how this looks and sounds, but shit, man, I never felt like this before. I'm just as confused as you are. What are you doin', huh?

No, we're not. No. We're getting married. Come here. We're not. This isn't happening. This isn't happening. This is just a "Ha ha, "let's teach the asshole a lesson," right? It might be. It might not be. I don't know. Oh. Oh, it might not be. Stop fucking touching her, okay? No, how could you do this? How could you do this? You did this to us. How could you do this, huh? How the fuck could you do this? Dude, you asked me to. I asked you? Fuck you. I'm getting my things. Fuck you. Fuck you, man. Where did you get that? Luke, where did you get that? Fuck you! God. Luke, where did you get that?! Okay, stop. You're a fucker. Fuck. Where did you get this? I'm sorry. I was scared. I don't care. I don't care about that, Luke, just tell me where you got this. Just tell her. I don't know, fuck. An old guy had a heart attack at the front door. I called 911, and they took him away. I forgot to give them the fucking box. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't breathe. Whoa, whoa, calm down. What is it? What did he say? I don't know. What did he say? I don't know, he fuckin', he asked about you, that's all. Oh, my God. - What's happening right now? - I don't know. He was my dad. What? Oh, my God. I can't. Step forward or step back. What the fuck does that mean? Who is it? My brother. I have a brother. I'm home. Hey. Hey. Clothes your eyes and take your shirt off. I got a present for you. Wait, I have to tell you somethin'. Just do it, hurry up. Just close your eyes. Come on. - Are your eyes closed? - They're closed. Okay, good, good. Keep 'em closed, keep 'em closed, keep 'em closed. All right, arms. Open 'em. You hate it, but you love ducks. You love ducks. I love it. It's awesome. Thank you. I've gotta tell you somethin'. Okay, okay, but hurry, all right? I'm starving. What'd you make for dinner? Wait, why don't I smell anything? Just sit down for me, please. Come here. Okay, I will. You're startin' to freak me out, Damon. So, your mom called me. She was tryin' to get ahold of you. Is everything okay? Is she all right? Yeah, she's fine. She's fine. It's your father. I guess he came here. What? My dad came here? Like, he's here? Can I just finish, please? This isn't easy, okay? Yeah, well, okay, well, please say it. Your mom got a call from the hospital, Taylor. I guess she said they told her that, I guess your father, he died. He just died. What? God, no, look, no. This is gotta just be some massive mix-up or something. My dad would never come here, right? He hates me. But he came here, that's the point. He came all this way. He came all this fuckin' way, now let's let him do what he came here to do, and go see him. It's important. No. I can't go. I'm not gonna go. Okay. But if I cared, you'd be right there with me? Of course. Come here. Come here. I'm sorry. Off you go. Where exactly are we going? Well, looks like there's only one place left to go. I just have one question. She's yours. She? Congratulations, papa. I knew I'd see you real soon. Are you ready? I didn't come this far only to come this far. It's just a few more steps, and you're there. I'm going, but you can bet your ass I'll be back. The world hasn't seen the last of me. I don't think it has. Maybe as a bird, or a horse. I like them, too. I just can't draw them for shit. Aren't you coming with? I have someone I have to see first. Oh, yeah, I know that look. I'll see you around, then. I can't believe I met my dad. I think I met him, too. What, how? When he left the bar, I bumped into him. I actually called him chief. I guess I am pretty clumsy. I don't know how to feel right now. You know, happy that I met him, or sad that I lost him again, mad at Luke? Be all three. Thanks for playin' along back there, but you don't have to wait with me. I'll be fine. Hey, I met your dad, ruined your wedding, kissed my friend's girl today. I might as well stay and meet your long-lost brother. I sound so dysfunctional. Plus, I realized I need a place to stay tonight. I think I do, too. 4B. I think it's this way. Taylor? Yeah. Who are you? Hi. Hey. What are you doing, Francesca? I've done my job. Michael and Cliff, two departures, Rachel and her baby, two saves, I'm done. She won't be able to see you. I want to see her. The longer you stay here, the longer it is for you to take another job. There are people that need you. She needs me. My daughter needs me. I don't know if you were ever a mother, but I would give up saving a million lives if I could see her. You cannot break the rules, Francesca. Fuck the rules. You can have tonight. Meet me at the shore at sunrise. Thank you. It's time for bed, little rascal. Did you brush your teeth? Yes. You want this up? Sure. Sweet dreams, honey bunny. Goodnight, Miss P. Goodnight. I love you, Mommy. I love you, honey bunny. Not yet. No matter who you are, what tongue you speak, or where you're from, there are always the same two words that are uttered before death. Sometimes shouted, sometimes whispered, but always, "Not yet." If you're here to take me back... I didn't come to take you back. Then, why are you here? Free will didn't die just because you did. The choice is yours. I can stay? What they don't understand is sometimes, even though the ones we love can't always hear and see us, it's worth it just to hear and see them. What do you choose, Francesca? I can't leave her again. Then, don't. But first, we must go before they come for you. I'll see you soon, my love.
