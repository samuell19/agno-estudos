[BUZZING] - That's the last of the load? - Yup. Alright. We're good! - Ho-ho. - Hey, Joe, I'm on a break. - Break, huh? - Yeah. You ever heard of one of those? No. Storm's coming. Take the load in the morning. Stay in town tonight. No. I'll be all right. I gotta be back by tomorrow and take care of some shit. Okay. - You got chains? - Yeah, I got chains. If you get caught, you make sure you chain up for S-curves. What is this, orientation? I got it. Besides, if it gets a little gnarly on the pass, I'll just bunk at your cabin. You leave now, you'll make it. You stay the fuck away from my cabin. - Drive safe, partner. - Always do, man. Hey! Dad! How'd you know I was up here? 'Cause the birds told me, that's why. They started chirping 'cause I was too close to their nest. Mwah. They tell you that was coming, huh? - Full moon. - No, no, no, no, don't! [YELPS] Stop! - Did you miss me, babe? - Yeah. It's been like three whole days. It was five days, honey. Charlotte get her. Save Mom! Stop! [LAUGHING] Get off of me. No, don't you dare! You better give me kisses. Give me a kiss. Soup's on the stove. Come here. Give me a kiss. Mwah. See you tonight. [LAUGHS] Okay. I'll see you tonight. If you're even up by the time I get home, I'll consider that foreplay. Uh-oh, what is that? I don't know what she's talking about. Where's your grandpa? Oh, putting up Christmas lights. Back there. Oh, yeah, Christmas lights. That was a real adventure. He's in the garage. Good luck with that. All right. You go make me some soup. Charlotte, you want a little brother? Mrs. Braven, see you tonight. Yeah. [SCREAMS] When I get home, Joe Braven, when I get home... I love you. Hey, Pops. Hey. What are you doing? I came out here to find something. Christmas lights. Right here, Dad. Oh. I thought they'd... Well, they should be up here. Put things in their proper place. You always put things where they're supposed to be. I'm working on it. Cheers. [BOTTLES CLINK] What is this? It's a porter. Tastes like a shit milk shake. [SCOFFS] Dinner's ready. Let's go. Daddy? JOE: Yeah. You were asleep again. - No. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh? - Yeah. You calling me a liar? - Stop! - Huh? - [LAUGHING] - You always fall asleep. That's 'cause it's time for bed. [CHARLOTTE SCREAMS] There's Piggy. But you didn't even finish the story. - Really? - Yes, really. All right, where were we? "The forest animals play hide and seek." Bethany Bear hides in her cave. She falls asleep, and her friends can't find her. Winter turns to spring. "And she's crowned the best hide and seek champion in the whole forest." The end. Boop. - [GROWLS PLAYFULLY] - [CHARLOTTE LAUGHS] [BLOWS RASPBERRY] [LAUGHING CONTINUES] CHARLOTTE: Stop! Good night, pig. Don't do that again. - I love you. - I love you too. Oh, I finished Grandpa's bracelet. Can I give it to him? He's probably asleep, honey, just like you should be. We'll give it to him tomorrow. Turn the light out. [CHARLOTTE LAUGHING] I love you. Pops? [HORN HONKING] [JUKEBOX] Oh, Jesus, not again. Hey, Pops. [PHONE RINGS] [RING] [RING] Hello? Joe, hey, it's Mike from the Trinity Bar. Yeah, listen, you better get over here. Yeah, your dad's here again. WOMAN: Excuse me? Time for us to go home. MAN: Let go. - Come on, baby. - I don't... Hey! - Joe! - I got it. I'm on my way. MAN: Linden, no! [SLAMS PHONE] - Hey, what's going on? - Dad's at the Trinity again. - I'll be back. - Okay. [MEN GRUNTING] You okay? No, no, I understand. Yeah, I understand. Okay, thanks, Harris. Guy he got into it with is on parole for aggravated assault, so he doesn't want to press charges, but... we got a problem, Joe. It kills me to see your father this way, but this happens again, I'm gonna have to arrest him. And you too. Yeah, I got it. We finished stitching him up 'cause it was a head injury. Daddy! Hello, pumpkin. Daddy, what happened to your face? I was wrestling with Grandpa. - How's he doing? - We finished stitching him up. - Go check on Grandpa, okay? - Okay. 'Cause it was a head injury, I ordered the MRI. - How's it look? - It looked okay, but how'd he get in a fight? He thought a woman at the bar was his wife. It was my fault. I was supposed to be watching him. Is he alone when you two are at work? I mean, I schedule my lessons to work around Joe being gone, but sometimes things come up. Well, since your father's accident last year, his mental condition is getting worse. Let me talk to another neurologist, okay? - He'll do a complete scan. - No, we're done with that. Then I suggest you consider a much more supervised approach. I'm not putting my dad in the home. Look, that's not the only option. Is he ready to go? Just think about it, Joe. Yeah. All right, baby girl. Let's get you home, get you to bed. CHARLOTTE: Okay. Bye, Dad. - See you at home. - Yeah. That's, uh... Donny's girl. Right? That's Charlotte, Dad. That's your granddaughter. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, Charlotte, yeah. Let's get you home, Pops, hmm? [SIGHS] [BEEPING] [BEEPING CONTINUES] You ready motherfucker, hmm? - [SIGHS] - Hey. Don't you puss out on me, man. So how often do you make this run up north again? About every two weeks. Okay, any other drivers that make this run? We're not gonna involve anyone else, man. Why the fuck not? That's how you branch out, move up. There ain't nobody else you can trust to bring on this deal? It's not about trust, man. I'm just not involving anyone else. That's why you're always gonna stay a fucking runner. That's fine, man. I'm just gonna collect my money. - [CRASH] - [TIRES SKIDDING] Hold on! What the fuck? [CRASH] Jesus Christ. HALLETT: What the fuck, man? Damn it. What the fuck? Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck is wrong with you? All you had to do was drive the fucking truck, man! We gotta get this shit out of here before somebody comes, man. Fuck. Go get my bag and the ax. [DOOR OPENS] - [DOOR CLOSES] - WESTON: Fuck! - Where is it? - Right here, right here. Give me the fucking flashlight. - Right here? - Crack that fucker open. There you go. [GRUNTING] [SCREAM] - That's my truck, man! - Holy shit. That's my fucking truck! Relax. Open the fucking log. Dude, just get back here. Hurry up. [CHOPPING] Jesus, that's a lotta dope. I know. Kinda makes you hard, don't it? [LAUGHS] Come on. Load the fucking bag up. - Here, take it out of the bag. - Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. We need to extinguish this, man. We gotta get rid of the dope before the cops come. Just get it in the bag. Dude, just figure out where we're gonna go. All right. We're not too far from my boss' cabin. It's a couple miles up the road. We'll stash it there. All right, let's go. [WOODCHOP] [CHOP] [CHOP] [CHOP] [CHOP] Honey, what are you doing? It's almost one in the morning. I'm almost done. Go back inside. Joe. [CHOP] Look at me. Hey. I don't wanna put my dad in a home. He's the strongest man I've ever known. Now look at him. I don't want Charlotte seeing him like that. I know. But we're a family. Okay? And we will make it through this. Maybe this doesn't have to be our decision alone. You can talk to your dad. Take him to the cabin. Just you and him. You know he loves it there. Just get the conversation started. Hey. - All right, this is it. - Thank God. [GROANS] You sure it's good here? Yeah. Joe's not coming up here, man. Oh, fuck. WESTON: All right. HALLETT: Come on, man, hurry up. It's cold as shit up here. Here. All right, good, man. We'll pick it up tomorrow. Fuck. Dude, I'm freezing. Just fucking take it if you're fucking cold. - Dude, I'm trying to share with you. - Take the fucking blanket, man. [DISTANT SIREN BLARING] Stay here. Thank God. Shit. It's okay. Relax. Don't worry about it. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] - [CAR DOOR CLOSES] - Thank you, sir! You stupid motherfucker. This is really funny to you, huh? That shit on the side of the road, that's my life. You should be worried about Kassen. I gotta make the call, so shut the fuck up about it. What's up, Kassen? Are you hungry? Pancakes here ain't half bad. Look, I know that I fucked up, but I'll make this thing right. Please give me the chance. WESTON: Fuck. [LINE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] [RINGING CONTINUES] What? Slight hiccup. I don't have it with me. Oh, no. But I got the whole load. Check this out, man. I know you wanted me to spread this out over several runs, but I got this whole motherfucking thing in one trip. Genius. Where is it? It's over the border, man. We got it stashed. It's all good. Slight hiccup is that we flipped the truck, and the cops came. I got my boy Pete coming after it. Don't worry about it. It's all good, all right? You tell Pete to stay home. - I'm coming. - You can't smoke that in here. - I'll get him to put it out. - Where the fuck are you? - It's okay. - Some fucking shitty hotel. - Sir! - It's okay, ma'am. I got it. Where we at, Weston? Greenwood Inn, room eight. We're at the Greenwood Inn, room eight. Fuck. Put it out, dickhead. Dickhead. This is gonna hurt. [CUSTOMERS YELLING] [LAUGHING] [CLEARS THROAT] Morning. Hey, Dad. - Morning, Grandpa. - Hey! Look at you. - Hey, you make that for me? - Yeah. Thank you. Hey, Pop, how you feeling today? I'm good. I feel good. Hey, I'm feeling like I'm ready to go back to work. I think you need to take the day off, Dad, okay? I was thinking maybe we'd go up to the cabin. Cabin? What for? Well, you can help me shut it down for the winter. [CHUCKLES] That's the first time your old man ever asked for my help with anything. All right, I'll go. I wanna go. Please? Hey, I'll take you hunting. Maybe I can fix one of those bad habits you're picking up from your dad. You know what? Actually, I don't have to work today, so I need your help around here. Oh, Mommy, please? Don't give me that look. No, ma'am. Don't look at me. Dad, I never see you. Charlotte, listen to me. I owe you, okay, baby? I promise I'll take you next time. You always say that. She's yours. Listen, I got everything packed up, so you wanna grab your stuff? All right. You mind if I eat an egg first? I'll drive. [LAUGHS] I got it, Pops, I got it. All right. [ENGINE STARTS] Get comfy, old man. HALLETT: Shit. Ah. - Hey. - Hey. Goddamn! You get off on this shit, huh? Nice G.I. Joe gear, boy. Who's your friend? This is Weston, man. He's gonna lead the way. Okay. Why don't you ride with Gentry? You can ride with us, Weston. Gentlemen! [IMITATES GUNSHOT] Hey, hey, hey, hey, easy, man. Hey, what's up, man? How you doing? [SIGHS] Good. We got power. We'll get those curtains open, let some light in. Somebody left the crib half empty. Wanna bring in some timber? Yep. There you go. Can I talk to you for a second, Dad? Why don't you get the coffee going? Yeah, yeah, just a minute. Can I ask you something? You remember what happened last night at the bar? I had a disagreement, wound up with 11 stitches. Yeah, I remember. You grabbed a woman by the arm and tried to pull her out. They said you thought she was Mom. Nah. I don't think so. Do you remember seeing Charlotte at the hospital? Hey, what is this, huh? What are you doing? What are these questions? The doctor thinks you need a different kind of supervision. [SCOFFS] I need to be supervised? No, but when you go off and do stuff that... What else does the doctor think? I need to be put somewhere, maybe put in a home, huh? No, we're not doing that, okay? But we gotta talk about something else that we can do. Oh, we do, huh? Let me tell you something. When my old man gave me the mill, he didn't have to because he could still get it done, and so could I. I didn't put him out to pasture. I didn't put him in some goddamn home with a bunch of drooling, bedwetting old bastards. I'm not gonna put you in a home. You're goddamn right you're not! Pops... Yeah. I forget some things now, all right? Hey, why don't you try falling 40 feet with nothing but a helicopter dash to break your fall? See how you wind up, huh? Hot shot. Pops, I don't wanna fight. I just wanna talk. Yeah? Is it working out the way you thought it would? Goddamn it. [DOOR SLAMS] [SIGHS] WESTON: Shit. Stop right here. Ah, shit. Uh, I think, uh... I think Joe might be up here, man. Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? You said the bag would be safe. All right. Any other roads out of here? No, this is the only one. There's ATV trails that go to the back ravines and Blue Mountain, but this is the only road. The cabin's about a half-mile away. Cell service? Not up here. Except for maybe up on Blue Mountain. All right, we're gonna secure the road 150 yards out. Clay, Louisi, take the east side of the road. Ridley, Essington, you take the west of the road. We're gonna flank him. Gear up. Yo, G.I. Joe, let me get one of those. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look, I know this guy. Let me talk to him. - What is this, man? - Talk to him, motherfucker? We just need to go back in there and get our shit. Anyone who hasn't royally fucked up in the last 24 hours, raise your hand. Shut the fuck up and do as you're told. Hit it. [SIGHS] What the... [GRUNTS] Latch is busted. - What the hell is that? - I don't know. Yeah. There's tracks out there. Footprints... around here. [CLICK] Hi, Daddy. Charlotte, what are you doing here? Does your mother know where you are? I left her a note. Were you in the back of my truck? - Yeah. - Baby, you're a rascal. Pops, let's go! Is everyone in position? Not yet. Almost. Dad, I'm sorry. Get in the car. [ENGINE STARTS] Another male rides shotgun. Take 'em both out. POPS: What? Something's not right. SNIPER: Come on. Baby, get down, get down. No shot. Let's move to the perimeter of the cabin. Essington, take the back east corner. Louisi, front east. Ridley, you'll take the front west. And, Clay, take the rear west. Let me know when you're each in position. Let's go. You can ride in the big boy's seat. Fuck, man. - Close the curtains, Pops. - CHARLOTTE: What's going on? It's gonna be all right, baby. It's gonna be all right. CHARLOTTE: Daddy? It's gonna be okay, baby, okay? - The CB is in the shed. - You good to shoot? What do you think? - Dad? - It's gonna be okay, baby. Grandpa and I gotta do a few things, all right? - I can help. - Help by staying out of sight. It is very important that you do not open this door unless it's for me, okay? - Okay. - All right, baby. Get in there. Okay, I love you. Ehh. Once you're in position, check in. ESSINGTON: Copy. Rear east. CLAY: I got rear west. RIDLEY: Copy. Front west. LOUISI: Roger. Rear east. KASSEN: Hold your positions until the bag is secure. This is Joe Braven up on Blue Mountain. Does anyone copy? [STATIC, INDISTINCT VOICE] This is Joe Braven on Blue Mountain. Do you copy? MAN: This is Fish and Game. Go ahead, Joe. - This is Joe Braven. - [STATIC] Come on, man. Why we standing around? Give me a gun. I'll go in there and get it myself. [SIGHS] Do you know this guy? Yeah, man. Tell me about him. How many of them? I make four, at least. But you need to see this. - Motherfucker. - Yeah. What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna go talk to him. - No, no. With that amount of drugs, they're not here to talk. They're gonna size you up, take you out, then come for us. I got an idea. Son of a bitch. Hey, you know what you're doing? I think so, Pops. KASSEN: Why don't you go bring him out? Look, his family's in there. Let's just come back for the shit, man. Motherfucker's got our drugs. KASSEN: Just bring him out. He's coming out. Louisi, Ridley, come in from behind. Well, look at you. I'm so sorry, man. Ah, Mr. Braven. Sorry to interrupt your day. - [THUD] - Yeah. Where the fuck's the rest of it? If you shoot me, my guys will burn the other half. Okay. You clear off my property. I'll meet you in town at the Waverlin Cafe in an hour. I'll bring the rest of it, and you'll never see me again. Oh, no, no, no, fuck that. You get your Sasquatch ass back in there and bring all of it out now, motherfucker. No, Joe, I don't wanna go into town. A city boy like me wouldn't be welcome there. And besides, what if I run into Stephanie or Charlotte? I didn't come here to kill good people. I just want what belongs to me. Joe, just do what they want and then... So how 'bout you go inside, get the rest of it, and then we'll be on our way. Could you do that for me, Joe? Please? Uh, yeah. Watch him. You know if you give the other half, we're as good as dead. I got a sniper in the front woods. I'd like to take him out. Not yet, Pops. We gotta get Charlotte out of here, then I'll come back for you. Until then, just wait. Roger that. Hi, baby. I got you. You're doing so good. Come on. It's gonna be okay, all right? Soon Grandpa and I are gonna need your help, all right? - I'm ready. - That's my tough little girl. You stay right here. I'll be right back. You still got 'em? POPS: Yeah, I do. Wait for my signal. Once we have the other half secured, take 'em all out. Copy that. Copy. Yeah, yeah. [SQUEAKS] [CLATTER] [GUNFIRE] He's got the bag! - [BULLET IMPACT] - Fuck! Goddamn it. You with me. Lay down some cover. Second floor. - [GUNFIRE] - God damn! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] - Nobody gets out of that cabin. - [ENGINE STARTS] - Go! - Oh, hell no! Hey! Hey! Hey, I need a fucking gun! [GUNSHOT] - [GUNSHOT] - Fuck. Charlotte, you remember the plan? - Okay. - Yeah? You get to the top, you call Mama. - Yeah. - I love you. Go. Run, run. Go! Stop. Kill the engine. [DISTANT ENGINE REVVING] Wait. The main road's that direction. Why is he looping back around? - Ah... - What's going on? He's not trying to run. He's going back to the cabin. I'm going uphill, try to find a sniper position. You push him back towards me. [TEA KETTLE WHISTLES] Charlotte! [WHISTLING DIMINISHES] Charlotte, come on, baby. [BEEPING] Oh, shit! All right. KASSEN: He's down on your side of the gorge. Secure the bag, clean him up. [DISTANT ENGINE IDLING] I got the bag. KASSEN: And where's Braven? I'll find him. Kassen, Joe didn't... KASSEN: Gentry, say again. Say again, Gentry. [SCREAMS] [YELLS] [PANTING] [DIALING] - [LINE RINGING] - Please pick up. [PHONE RINGS] - Joe. - Mom? Charlotte? Charlotte, you can't run off like that. Stop. Mom, there are men shooting at us. - What did you say? - They're shooting. I'll meet you at the lookout boulder on Blue Mountain. Where are you? Hello? Charlotte, baby, I'm losing you. - Hello, hello? - [LINE BEEPS] [PHONE BEEPING] [LINE RINGING] OPERATOR: If you'd like to make a call... [DIALING] If you'd like to make a call... Shit. [PHONE RINGING] Sheriff Ossler. Hey, Cal? This is Stephanie Braven. Listen, Joe's up at Blue Mountain. There seems to be some sort of trouble. - Trouble? - Yeah. Charlotte called and said there were men shooting. I don't know. Anyway, she lost reception. I tried calling her back, and I can't get through. All right, we'll check it out. - I'm headed up there right now. - No, you're not. We'll handle it. Just hurry, please. Dispatch, this is Ossler. Deputy Harris and I are headed over to Blue Mountain to respond to a call. Will advise when we arrive. What's going on? Shots fired over at the Braven cabin. Let's go. Man, look, it's probably just some kids who are shooting cans off some fence posts or something. Fuck you, man. That's fucked. Shit. I think Joe's daughter was in that cabin. Ridley, get to the top of the mountain. Kid's trying to call for help. - Essington. - Copy. Move to the west side of the cabin. Take a cover position. Clay, take your position near the back. I get my hands on this bag, we kill all these sons of bitches. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Clay, bag was another decoy. He's headed towards you. You go east along the trail. I'm coming. We'll flank him. [COUGHING] [GROANING] MAN ON RADIO: Over. I'm trying to find it. KASSEN: Clay, find the ATV trail. He's coming back on that. The drugs are still in the cabin. Essington, Hallett, hold the perimeter. Do not engage. Do not give him any excuse to burn those drugs. [GARBLED RADIO TRANSMISSION] [AIR HISSING] Goddamn it! [HALLETT LAUGHING] You fucking missed me! Fuck! I should just fucking shoot him. You dumb fucking Indian. Whew! Fuck. [SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] [PANTING] Clay. - Clay, you see him yet? - Not yet. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] - Come on. - He's right there! KASSEN: Come on! KASSEN: Essington, Joe's coming. Move to the east side of the cabin, near the trail. See if you can't get a clean shot on that sniper. Take him out. Goddamn bastard. [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] Fuck. - No! - [GUNSHOT] Ah, fuck! Pin him in! Dad! Dad! [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] Dad! Dad! Dad, Dad, it's Joe. Dad, it's Joe. It's Joe. - [SCREAMS] - Joe, Joe. Dad, it's me.

Sit down, sit down, sit down. - Sit down, sit down. - [GROANS] Pops, look at me. Look at me. - I need you to wait here, okay? - Okay. - Stay here. - I'll come with you. All right, Pops, I'll be right back. - Joe. - Stay here. CHARLOTTE: No! [YELLS] Charlotte! Charlotte, run! Go to the road! [SCREAMING] You take the side and the front entrances. I'll go around the back. We're taking this goddamn cabin now. Fuck. [GRUNTS] - [GLASS SHATTERS] - [YELLS] [YELLING] [SCREAMING] Hey, hey! - Cal, stop. It's Charlotte. - My mom and dad need help! There are men chasing my mom and dad. - They're all over the cabin. - Dispatch, this is 101. Please send available units to the Braven cabin, Blue Mountain Pass. Come on, Glen.

I'll go back inside, get the bag, and you can go. - Okay? - You'll get my bag? - Yeah. - You gonna get my bag now? I'm sorry. That's what I wanted in the first place! Bring me another bag of teddy bears? Fuck you! Just let him go. He doesn't know what's going on. He's sick. Please. Please just let him go. Just let him go. - You did this. - Son, please. You did this to him! - No! - Yeah! - Old fuck! - No! Yeah! - Hey. - [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] No, no, please no. Fuck. Son. Dad. [GASPING] No. No, no. Dad. [SOBBING] Pops. No. Oh, God.
