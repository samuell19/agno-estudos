(ominous music) (soft music) (eerie music) (woman screams) (soft music) - [Woman] Dear Birthe, I'm writing to you now, even though you'll be home next week. I've been thinking of you ever since a girl your age was brought into the hospital. She was suffering drug hallucinations. (soft music) (doorbell rings) (soft music) No, oh no. - [Man] Good evening, Siv - No dear, do you think you live here? - Yes, tonight. I'm taking time off from the wife and the family. - Save your jokes. I'm not in the mood. - No, but you will be. - Come on, do me a favor, go. - Not a chance. - What if I got to say, this evening I don't want to see anybody. - Siv, be still, it won't do any good to raise a fuss. - I keep thinking of that drug patient today. 17 year old girl. - The last patient I had was only 13, a totally hopeless addict. Natural you're fearsome. But when you permit those feelings to grow, you get so upset, you have to blow your brains out, or be sent to a sanatorium. - Then it shouldn't matter to us. - Nope. Nothing should matter but this. - No. None for me, Leo. - You love whisky and don't I know it. Only one drink. There you are. For you. Come on. Like me, more. I wish you do as the doctor orders you. That medicine will make you much better. - You're hopeless. Why do we go on like this? - Because you love me. - You don't really image that it's anything like that. - Well, you feel something for me. An attraction. I feel exactly the same. Not a bad feeling. And for the time being, well, it's enough. - Exactly. School? - School. Don't hang back. Keep right up with me. Come on now. - Okay. (soft music) - It's cold. No, no, you got to do better than that. Come on. I almost forgot. - What? - I brought you a present. - You did? - Where's my bag, hmm? - There. (laughter) - [Leo] Here. Take a look. (soft music) How do you like it, eh? - What have you got there? - Well, a mechanical massager. The answer to every woman's prayer. It's an expensive model. Battery operated with three speeds. Ah, you can laugh, but do you know how many are sold in this country today? - No. - No, but 400,000. - I don't believe it. - Yeah, that's right. And I'm beginning to worry. You won't need any of us in the future. Pay attention. You know what this is called? - Uh uh. - That's a busy body. (laughter) It's got a lot of uses. It's also supposed to mix cocktails. The ad says so. - It's advertised? - Siv, Siv, you're not keeping up with events. Now, look here. You read this paper every day, I bet. In front, news stories. And inside you find pictures, market closings, cultural stuff. Books, theater, films, a few articles, and ads for buying things on time, followed by some sports. And here at last, but not least, see and entire page on sex from pornography down to books, magazines, pictures, sex clubs, group sex, massage clinics, everything the heart can desire. Well, maybe not the heart exactly. - [Siv] I never noticed. - Believe it. We live in a very broad minded little country. No censorship, none at all. Even if we're not the big power in the world, we've taken the lead in the sex revolution. - I believe it's in progress. - I'm glad. Wait a minute. I have another present for you. (soft music) (pleasureful grunting) - That how we sound? - We are better because we aren't stereophonic sound. (soft music) (pleasureful moaning) (soft music) (soft music) What's going on? - Don't just stand there like that. Hurry, get dressed. (soft music) Birthe, what are you doing here? Why didn't you phone me to let me know you decided to come early? I could have-- (soft music) If only you'd phoned, I would have gone to meet you, and instead you just, how could I have known? Well if only you'd have called. (soft music) Birthe. - It's alright. - I can explain it to you. - So explain it then. - You mustn't feel like this. There's nothing wrong about it, dear. - And the man? - A friend. - Do you love him mother? - No. - Are you going to marry him? - God forbid, marriage. (soft music) - Well, I guess I'll be going. Goodnight. - [Siv] Goodnight. - Mother, you might introduce us. - Pardon me, of course. This is Dr. Leo Smidth. And she is my daughter, Birthe, just arrived from Switzerland. - Your daughter? - Uh huh. Say hello to Dr. Smidth. We both work at the laboratory. - Well this is a pleasure. You didn't tell me you had a daughter. - You have one too. I even know her name, it's Greta, I think. We have the same instructor. - Then you know her? - Oh yeah, I've talked with her. - She's a pretty girl, and very nice. I must be running along. Goodbye again. - Doctor, tell me, you love Greta's mother, I suppose. - How dare you. - Yes, I love her very much, Birthe. In fact, we have two other daughters, and a boy as well. However, that's my business. Goodnight. - I can't understand you mother. You're seeing him. (soft music) - Yes? Come in. - It's about that journal I'd like to borrow. - Oh yes. Okay, here it is. - Thank you. What's the matter? Is there something wrong? - No. Why? - Where's that smile? You're usually smiling. Come and show me you can smile. - [Dr. Smidth] It's a mess, isn't it? - What do you mean, doctor? - [Dr. Smidth] I mean what happened last night. - Please Leo, the whole thing is in the past. Let's not talk about it. - That's easy for you to say. But it could end my marriage. How close is she to my daughter? Are they friends? Will she tell Greta all about it? - If you go on raving like this, I won't listen to you. - Well, I'm sorry. But in my position, what would you do? - This thing didn't happen to you alone. I also stand to lose a lot. - [Dr. Smidth] What do you mean? - Birthe's my daughter. She is very young and coming across as that was as a shock. Let's face it. I tried hard to protect her and spent my money to educate Birthe. She's as important to me as your marriage is to you. - I know that alright. But you're young and unmarried. What's it to her? - Understand her views about me. To anybody 17, all mothers are old. I am absolutely forbidden to have a natural sex life. It's very immoral, wicked, revolting. (pleasureful grunting) (toy vibrating) I can't give her much in life. I don't have time. But I did try to protect her so she wouldn't to another mother, Leo. - Don't be foolish. You're a fine person. And you're one of the most beautiful women I know. - No more of that. - [Dr. Smidth] But you are intelligent, cool, sexy. You admit for me. - And what good is that then? That can't happen to Birthe. (pleasureful grunting) (loud rumbling) - You there, freak out. - Those hot heads, everyone's a big fairy. - Sure, they enjoy being beaten. (laughter) - Hey, to your holes. (groovy music) (laughter) (groovy music) - Birthe? Birthe? (soft music) (groovy music) - Stand here beside sunny boy, will you, while I go open my rainmaker. In other words, I have to go pee. - Hi. - hello. - You're first time here? Ah, not more than your second time, is it? - No. I come here often. - That's funny. I don't remember seeing you here before. - You come here often? - Well, I don't know if you'd call it often. I come here with my sister, Lisa, the go-go girl. (groovy music) I came over here to study. You know, that's why I'm over here. - That's enough of that. She's my girl. (groovy music) - Birthe? (groovy music) (screaming) (glass breaking) (groovy music) (glass breaking) (groovy music) (screaming) (groovy music) (glass breaking) (groovy music) (screaming) - Come on, you. (groovy music) (fighting) - Don't freak out. We don't want Yankees here man. - Where'd she disappear? (soft music) - Come on, stop dragging behind. This is great. This is life. (soft music) (groovy music) - Lisa. - What? - Would you happen to know where those hippies hang out? - Why do you ask? - No reason. I just like to have the address if you have it. - Are you on the hunt? - [Stephen] On the hunt? - Yeah, for some potter hashish or some other shit. - Oh, come on. If I were after that, I could easily get it at the hospital. Don't you think? - Yeah, I suppose you're right. What is it you're after? - After? Oh, I just want to see their hangout, sniff the atmosphere. I'm gonna be a psychiatrist, remember. - Stephen, I believe they hang out in a condemned building in the Princess skeldale. But I'm not quite sure. - Can I borrow your car? (groovy music) - Are you going there tonight? - [Stephen] Uh huh. (groovy music) (soft music) - Take a great big puff. What's the matter with you? It's straight hash, nothing mixed into it. (soft music) Come on, you'll get a charge. That's it. Now draw it down in your lungs. Hold it inside you for a while. You'll forget everything that's wrong with this damn world. War, violence, money. It's 18 caret shit, huh. (soft music) - Sometimes I dream of being raped by a gorilla, an enormous, hideous anthropoid ape inside a cellar full of water rising up over us. We almost drown. Would you like to be beaten? I'd like it. I hate violence. Only I would like to be beaten, be flogged front and back, in the moonlight as a dog, you bite hearts by graveyard watching, watching us. (soft music) - My god. Wow, what a night. (soft music) - [Birthe] No. No, don't. Stop it. No. No. Stop it. No. No. No, no. No. No, no, stop it. - Hey. Egon, it's a loosing battle. She's a lesbian. - Why do you say that? - I know lesbians. They have photographs like this in their purses. - [Birthe] Give me that. Give me that picture. (laughter) - Take a look a that body. What a doll. (laughter) - [Birthe] Give that to me. Give it to me. Give me that. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give that to me. - Are you really a lesbian? - Does this belong to you? - Alright, you, butt out. - Wouldn't you rather stay with me? She's not much. (laughter) - Hey, wait. - Go to hell, you damn American pig. And get that lesbian out of here. (soft music) - Hey, relax. Now come on and drink this. Come on. It'll relax you. - I hate you. - Stop it. You're hysterical. - [Birthe] I hate you. - Jesus Christ, be quiet. - [Lisa] Stephen. Have you gone mad? - She, she was getting hysterical. - I'd be hysterical too if I were in her place. - [Stephen] No, you don't understand. - I wonder. I'll see to it that he doesn't harm you anymore. - I haven't tried to harm her. I tried to help her. (soft music) - You certainly take liberties. First you try to rape her, now your nosing through her things. - I was trying to help her. I can tell she's gonna end up in a mess. - Since when the hell have you become so philanthropic? - I'm not philanthropic. I have to may be in love with her. - [Lisa] In love? - Yes, but (inaudible) at least I knew her name. - [Lisa] Have you forgotten that you're a negro? - [Stephen] So what else is new? - And you really think she'll have you? Yes, maybe for a night. Black men are suppose to be well equipped. - [Stephen] Look Lisa, I'm in love. - Oh you are? And suppose you have children that are accepted by no one. Stephen, when one is black, one doesn't have interracial children. - [Stephen] Is that why you become a lesbian? - [Lisa] I won't have children either, black nor mixed. - Well, I happen to think that's a twist in the hysterical point of view. - That's because you're so naive and idealistic. Who's that? - [Stephen] You're type, perhaps. I mean I happen to know the lady. I can fix you up. But you'll have to promise to keep your hands off the little girl in there. - Do you realize how cruel you are right now. - Excuse me for disturbing you like this, Mrs. Ohm, but I must speak to you. - Yes? If you can make it quick. - Do you know a girl named Birthe Esro? - Has something happened to her? - No. - Do you know where she is? - Yes. - Where is she? - Before I answer that, I'd like to know how well you know her. - She's my daughter. - Your daughter? - Yes. - She never mentioned anything. - Yes. Where is she? What's happened to her? - Nothing's happened to her. - Where is she? - Relax. She's at my place. - At your apartment? - Yes. - Has she been there all night - Yes. Where are you going? - I'm going to get her, of course. - Oh no you're not. - And why not, may I ask? - Let's talk. Let's talk about Birthe. - What do you know about Birthe? - What do you know about her? - Here's a clean towel. Here, put this on. Let's eat now. - Aren't you going to eat? - Yes. - Why do you keep staring at me? - I can understand him. - Who? - Poor little Stephen. He's very much in love with you. Didn't you know that? - No. - What's wrong? Don't you like him? Because he's a negro? - No. It has nothing to do with that. - Why then? He's a kind and intelligent person. And furthermore, he wants to marry you. - Marry me? - He told me so. - I'm never going to marry him or anyone else, ever. - Why? - Because I hate men. They're so brutal and vulgar. - Have you ever slept with a man? - Never. - And a woman? - No. - Then what about her? Isn't she the one you're really in love with? Take a really good look. - It's my mother. - Don't cry. - I loved her. But now I hate her. (crying) I despise her. - Why? - [Birthe] What is she? A sex magnet who only thinks of men, many men? She liked doing that. You can see by the look of her eyes posing for that, that piece of trashy pornography. - What? - [Birthe] She's a whore. She's a whore. She's a whore. She's a whore. (sensual music) (loud rumbling) - [Stephen] Lisa? - [Man] You like babies, don't you? - Yeah. - [Man] Why? - Because they're fairies. They call us fascists, yet they are a bunch of stinking communists who don't do a thing. - Not only that, but daring them to fight shows everyone how scared they are. And we get mentioned in the papers showing everyone how tough we are. See what I mean. Hey that black boys think they can hang out. - Then you don't feel that they should mix with blacks. - Anybody feel they should? - School teachers, for example. - Ah, the teachers. What do you mean? They got one thought, summer vacation. But why the hell did you come here? You need some pot? - He's a TV fag announcer. - Just as I thought, a very abnormal type. (laughter) (groovy music) - I have a greeting from your mother. - Do you know her? - We work at the same hospital. - Really? - Are you going home tonight? Why not? - Why should I? - Because she's worrying about you. (groovy music) - I want to make one thing quite clear. We are peace loving people and we have nothing against you. - But if our girls prefer to sleep with strangers instead of us, - Then we might have to do something about it. - You got 10 seconds to get back to your table. - Who you threatening man? (screams) (groovy music) - Stick around, you have a fight on your hands. (groovy music) Wait, come back you. (groovy music) (screaming) (groovy music) Seig heil, Yankee. You learn these methods in Vietnam? Right war monger? Go on. Get your whore out of here. Fascist. (groovy music) (group chatter) - I can't stand the stink, he's coming with it. (group chatter) - You're crying. Why? - Because people are so mean and cruel. I didn't think it was possible. - You mean what happened here tonight? - Yes. - It's nothing. - But we are in Denmark. It can't happen. - It happens every minute of the day all over the world. - But how can you be so calm? - It's not being calm. It's just getting used to it. What happens in this country is nothing. - Why is life so ugly? - Right now it looks very beautiful. - Beautiful? Why? - Because I love you. - Stephen, don't say that. - I love you. I never thought I could feel this way. So, you're a racist too. You reject me because of my color. - Do you think something happened to Lisa? - Lisa? Lisa. - I was afraid something might have happened to you. - [Birthe] How did you get away from them? - I ran. I had to come see if you're alright. - What a fool I've been. Here I've been working side by side with a before woman, a beautiful natural woman who loves men. I can see it in her face. - Who are you talking about? - Birthe's mother. - [Lisa] Where are you going? - Over there. I'm not wanted here. - No. - You'll stay right here. - He will do it. Go over to her-- - And go to bed with her, is that what you're trying to say? What about it? Have you forgotten what you said about her this afternoon? (sensual music) - Stop it. - I can understand his being sexually attracted to her. Any man would be. - Perhaps you are too. - And so are you. She's the only one you really want to go to bed with. - That's a lie. It's a lie. - She's in love with you. - You're crazy. I never heard anything so sick. - Just imagine if she were lying beside us right now. Wouldn't that be fantastic? I'd like to have her. Wouldn't you? Instead she's lying beside Stephen. I wonder if he's enjoying it. Just imagine, you, her, and me. Wouldn't that be wonderful? - Oh, come on. Why do you think she carries that provocative photograph of you around in her pocketbook? (sensual music) - Think about it when I kiss you. Think about it when I kiss you. (sensual music) - You don't understand her. - Birthe. What's happened? - [Birthe] Tell me that you love me. Tell me, Stephen. - I love you. (upbeat music) A penny for your thoughts. - I have the feeling I'm being loved for the first time in my life. - But your mother loves you. - No, she never loved me. - Won't you order. - Two coffees, please. - What's that? Oh, two coffees. Yeah, we have that. And besides the coffee? Cream pie? Homemade cake? Layer cake, eh? Layer cake. White bread with a little cheese? It's good. - Are you hungry? - No. - No, she's not hungry. How about something a little stronger? Cognac or brandy? She'd like a drop. No, she doesn't like it. - No, just two coffees. - Just two coffees. Yeah, yeah. Pardon me. Both of them black, I believe. That's what it is. - He's a nice fellow. (laughter) - [Carl] Two coffees for table four. - Carl, look at that. Isn't that beautiful when you see a nice couple in love? - For god's sake, you think they love each other? That girl and that colored? - He loves her. But you don't understand love. - If that's love, I'll take beer. - We were talking about your mother. - She gave me a lot of expensive presents when I was a little girl. Later it was expensive clothes. And then she sent me to the best private schools in Switzerland. But she never gave me love. When I was home on holidays, I always felt I wasn't wanted. She seemed relieved when I left. - Sounds typical of many parents, just too busy with themselves. - What were your parents like? - I didn't know my father. But my mother gave me all the love in the world. It's not easy, you know, being a little black boy raised in a white man's world. Hey, how would you like to come to New York as my wife? - Me? - I think my family would like you. Especially if you learned to cook soul food. - What is soul food? - Oh, chitlins, candied yams, black eyed peas, hog mauls. - Okay, I'll learn that, if you read Hans Christian Anderson for the kids in Danish. - It's a deal. - Why do you love me? - Well, when I saw your skinny legs and your crossed eyes, and those big buck teeth, I said now that's the girl for me. - Please be serious. - I don't know, it's, it's not easy to describe why you love someone. It's all magic. - How will it be for us in America? - I think we have a chance. I mean we're the new generation. We're not tied up with those racial hangups. We'll have to fight, but we'll make it. Do you have a room? - Huh? - [Stephen] A room. - [Carl] A room? - [Stephen] Yes. - [Carl] A room? No. - You don't have any rooms here at all? - No. No. You know what the hell he wants, a double room? - So, it's vacant. - I know that. But we can't rent to them. I told him no. Yeah, but. - Thank you. This is nice. You know, you've got the bluest eyes I've ever seen. That mole on your cheek, that means the angels kissed you. - Do you say that to all the girls? - Yeah. Wait a minute. It won't work that way. Wait, wait, wait. Me first, then you next, okay. (laughter) Success. (laughter) - No. (soft music) - You have such soft skin. - I like your skin much better. (soft music) - Good luck. - [Birthe] Thank you. - Good luck. - [Stephen] Thank you. - A marriage always takes me back. - Look, they're coming. - Ever think of going with a black? You know what everyone says that they're just built for it. - I've got not use for them. In my opinion, that's perverted. (soft music) (church bells tolling) (lively music) - [Man] Good morning. - [Stephen] Good morning. (lively music) - This one's for Siv. Siv, your daughter's just married a fine young man and a good friend. He's intelligent, gifted, very personable. In fact, the one man for Birthe. I'm drinking to him. Now drink and wish them health and happiness in the future. - Oh, I loathe myself. - What are you crying about? - You know, I imagine myself so very tolerant. Why should it be any different now? What you say is quite right. He's intelligent. And he adores her. But deep down, I wish she would have married somebody else. Birthe's my daughter and he's a negro. (lively music) - Hey. (lively music)
