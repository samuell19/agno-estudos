Hello, Mr De Wachter? Hello, it's Cleo. Cleo Van Daele. Yes. I'm calling about my parent's case. Yes. Yes, OK. Very well. Thank you. Bye. Cleo? Dinner's ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these, Thy gifts, which we are about to receive from Thy bounty, and give bread to those who have none. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. - Enjoy! - Enjoy. Cleo, can you stay with Bruno tomorrow night? I'm meeting up with Paulette. I've got a party tomorrow. Do you feel ready to party? Come on Gran, Myra invited me. Where is it? CLUB 7. That nightclub? Is that a joke? I have a life. You're only 17, Cleo. At your age I was learning to knit. And I'm 7, Granny. I know sweetie, you're a big boy. Listen, you babysit tomorrow and on Saturday you're free. - Agreed? - Agreed. Will you call doctor Verdonck to make an appointment? I don't need a doctor. Mama... Hello Minoes. Are you hungry, Minoes? Come on, Minoes. You are hungry. That was so funny. - Hi there, JB. - All good? She's with me. Thanks. I want to be able to do that. Myra, they all have really long legs. - Hey, Cleo! - Hey. - Hi Vera. - It's been too long. Exactly six months, right? I'm really sorry I didn't come to see you. With school and everything, I was so busy, sorry... It's OK. But are you feeling better? Yeah, everything's great. - Hey Myra, how you doing? - Hey Bram. - And you're...? - Cleo. Pill? Go on then. Good evening. 10 euros. - Hey Bram, having fun? - Hey, Cleo... Are you OK? I'm OK. Why did you defend me? I don't like it when women get hit. Hold this. You come here a lot, do you? Depends. Did he hurt you? Could be worse. And you? Does it hurt? A little. If you want, I live close by, in Anderlecht. I can give you some ice to put on it. So, you coming? Aren't you ever scared in Brussels? No, I live here. OK, but it's kind of late for a girl to be by the canal on her own. You sound just like my gran. I take you home with me and I don't even know your name. Leos. Nice. Cleo. Be quiet in the corridor. You want to drink something? No thanks. You can sit down. Look at the two of us sitting here, two cripples. - A lot of you in the house? - 3 of us. Bruno, my little brother, my gran and me. And your parents? They moved to Washington. Washington? Yeah... They're workaholics with a misplaced desire for children. Diplomats. And what do you do? I work at a karting. - A karting? - Yes. - You race go-carts? - No, I'm a mechanic. I'm more interested by the inside of cars. I hate cars. A match made in heaven. Aren't you going to ask for my number? I don't have a pen. - Don't you have a mobile? - Not anymore, no. I do have a landline. OK. Old school. Go on, tell me. 02... 265 78 65. I'll definitely call you, Leos. - Sleep well. - You too. Daughter of Dilbeek pianist survives deadly road accident. The pianist and his wife died when their car crashed into the canal. Pianist Jacques Van Daele and wife, E. Dierickx, in fatal accident. 16-year-old daughter, C. Van Daele survives. Tomato. Salad. Cauliflower. You can't use cauliflower. Ah Cleo, you're up. Did you get home late? Around 2. Did you cycle back? Myra accompanied me. - We've eaten, are you hungry? - No, I'm fine. You've got a hangover. Don't look at my cards. - Are you having fun? - Yep. - Do you want to play too? - Maybe later. OK. Here Cleo. - Thanks. - You'll feel better. I put some of Mum's clothes in your bedroom. There are some really nice black jumpers. They'll go well with your colour. I don't want to wear their stuff. Anyway, it's not my style. It's not her style. - Whose go is it? - Yours. Court in hunt for hit-and-run suspect - Hi there. - Hey. - Does it hurt? - No. - Who did it to you? - An asshole. You went back to CLUB 7? You're lying to me. You can talk to me, you know. Are you depressed? Are you sure you know what you're doing? - If you're hiding things again... - Oh, well done! - Tell me what's wrong. - Get off my back, Jeanne. - We're here. - Hi Cleo. Hello Gran, hi Bruno. - Are you playing piano again? - No. Jacques Van Daele, please leave a message after the beep. Jacques Van Daele, please leave a message after the beep. Make sure you keep practising. Cleo. Hello, Mr Peeters. Come. How are you? You think I can manage this? Rachmaninov. It's ambitious. A Van Daele can take it on, right? - Have you continued playing? - A bit. Go for it. Come on, swing up. Swing up. ...three. I saw the mysterious guy from the CLUB 7 again. He was waiting for me outside. His name is Leos. Nice name, Leos, right? Fits perfectly with me. - Fits perfectly between your legs. - What! For fuck's sake, Cleo. He's at least ten years older and really good looking. So he's definitely got a girlfriend then. You're jealous. Have you checked him out on Facebook? I'm not on Facebook anymore, you know that. Right, Leos, and what else do you know? - Myra, I'll call him myself, OK? - OK then. So what do I say to him? "Hey Leos, it's Cleo..." Too insecure. What's the problem, just ask him out. "Would you care to go for a drink in the near future?" In the near future? -Do you want to hook up with him or not? - Come on! "Hey baby, you wanna come for a drink with me?" Fuck you. OK, wait. You just wait. Fuck. - Hello, this is Leos... - It's his voicemail. OK, leave a message. Hey Leos, it's Raph, when are we going for that beer? Do you ever leave your house? Laters... Hey Leos, I really enjoyed Saturday night. I'd like to see you again. Fancy going for a drink next week? Call me back...OK? Call me back, my number is 0487 56 89 65. Oh, yes, it's Cleo. Speak soon. Dear Cleo, It's difficult for me to write to you, but... My dearest Cleo, Now that we have met each other, I've finally plucked up the courage to write to you. I am a really good driver, but sometimes I drive too fast. ...like on that one Friday night... That night... That night I robbed you of everything and I still don't understand why I fled. There's nothing more to say. Leos. Three, two, one... Calm now... Breathe calmly... Gala Christmas Concert Paris Philharmonic Rachmaninov concertos N° 2 & 3 This is a nice jacket, isn't it? - Don't you want it? - No. Eline's clothes are for Cleo, Mum. Arianne, have you seen what she wears? Take it. No, I've got lots of jackets. ...and give bread to those who have none. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Well done, Bruno. Come on. Meat balls! Hmm...Meat balls. - On them or next to them? - On them. Yes... Next to them. Did you have fun at football? Yes, but my friends want to know why you always pick me up? They find you so old. You told them I'm your granny, didn't you? Yes, but Dad always used to come and pick me up. Yes... - Who did you play with? - With Marcus. But Marcus said that his big brother Thomas said Cleo likes getting dirty with the boys. Dirty with the boys? Is she dirty or not? What does it mean, Granny? What does it mean, Cleo? - Come here! - Stop it now. I'll clean your mouth out! - Your dirty little mouth! - Get off me! Stop Cleo! He's just a child. Come here. It's nothing. It's nothing. You know, you look so much like your mum. You know, you're supposed to knock on the door. The jacket suits you. What happened, Cleo? I know it's not easy for you, but... You can trust me, after all, I am your gran. - Are you taking drugs? - Of course not. You know, I also lost your mum. It's hard for me too. I know. I miss them. Piano, piano, piano... Play on... - Stop, stop, stop. - What? - What's this? - Agitato. What does that mean? - With agitation. - With agitation, so not... Yes, OK? Go. Crescendo. Play on... Forte. Forte. - Shouldn't you be at school? - Shouldn't you be at work? My job at the karting is only part time. They make good coffee here. Better than at Starbucks. They're going to turn this place into a Starbucks too. - Really? - Yes. Americans... They buy up all these beautiful old cafés. And the charm of these old venues is lost. And on top of that they make crap coffee. Water with foam on top of it. You pay 5 euros, and when you order they ask you, "What is your name, sir?" "What? My name?" "I just want a relaxed coffee. Why do you need my name?" Jesus! I always give them another name, a really complicated one. Evpraksiya. - Is that a real name? - Yep, it's Russian. Leo Groski, a pleasure. A pleasure. How old are you actually? 17. What? Is that too young? Too young? Too young for what? For you to jerk off to? Who do you take me for? I'm... I'm what...? 13 years older than you? Have you got a girlfriend? Yes. - And what's her name? - Jeanne. Jeanne... - Do you live together? - Yes. Yes, we live in the North neighbourhood. And does Jeanne know you're in a café with me? - Are you always like this? - I have my moments. I prefer it when you're normal. Great, Leos. I'm going to the toilet. Keep an eye on my bag? And Cleo has found her way to school. Hey, Cleo here... I thought you might be home, but I guess not... It was good to see you again. I really enjoyed it. When shall we meet up again? Are you coming back to CLUB 7, or...? Missing me already? Just joking. Leos? Leos? There's nothing more to say. I don't expect forgiveness. - Hey Gran. - Hey sweetie. - All good at school? - Yep. Hey big guy. Where d'you learn that? You should talk to him, Cleo. May I come in? I'm sorry, Bruno. I shouldn't have shouted at you like that. I'm sorry about the cherries. I'll never do it again, OK? You have to tell Marcus his brother's a liar. So you're not dirty? No, I'm not. I wash myself pretty well, don't I? Every night. From now on I'll only be looking after you. Really? - It'll be just you and me. - Really? Really. Friends again? Friends again. Come here. You know, sometimes having a mobile can be useful. - Do you know what you want? - Yes. A certain Cleo called the flat. When did she call? Who is she? Jeanne, she's 17. Are you jealous? Are you ready to order? For me the spaghetti alla Norma . - Garlic scampi, please. - Would you like wine? - Yes, with pleasure. - A glass or would you like a bottle? Oh no, he doesn't drink anymore. Ever since he totalled his car when he was drunk. So just a glass of red wine for me, please. - Sir? - An ice-tea for me. Very well. Was it at CLUB 7 you chatted her up? Jeanne, she's just a kid. Where did you meet her? At the karting. - At the karting? - Yes. Why are you lying? In her message, she said she wanted to see you again at CLUB 7. You're weird. Since the accident you've been really weird. Was she with you that night? Was she? Was she involved in the accident? Leos, answer me! Yes... Here you go. You're really fucking everything up. What does it mean? That the heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing. Not everything can be explained, says Pascal. Especially in love. Beautiful. Take it with you. Read it. OK. Thanks. And, isn't Jeanne home today? Jeanne no longer lives here. - Why not? - Better for me to live alone. At least you don't live with your granny. A Technics, that's so cool. - I still belong to the analogue era. - I noticed. Do you also listen to classical music? - I have a Satie record, yes. - Satie! Satie is a pussy. Know your stuff, do you? Yeah, I've played piano since I was five, so... - Want to hear something? - Yeah. Yes... I discovered this last week, it's hilarious. Wait... YouTube... Listen carefully. No? No what? All by Myself by Eric Carmen. Covered by Céline Dion. It's stolen from Rachmaninov. Carmen paid through his nose for it. How do you know all that? My father was a concert pianist. And not anymore? No. Now... Now, he has too much work as a diplomat. Really? Yes. What...? Did you look me up? My ex found that magazine. Pianist Jacques Van Daele and wife in fatal accident The magazine's four months old, we didn't know each other then. Jeanne read that article when she was at her physiotherapist's. She asked me if you were that Cleo. You really think I would buy that kind of magazine, Cleo? - So you told her about me? - No, she... She heard your message on the answering machine. And yes, she was jealous. I never told you about my accident. How did she know it was about me? I've known for ages, Cleo. Everyone at CLUB 7 knows. Why have you never told me? So you knew? - I wanted to give you some time. - Time? I thought you'd run a mile if you knew. Why would I... I really don't want to talk about it. Sorry. You have nothing to be sorry for. Do you believe me now? Yes, I believe you. Let's go. - I reckon we'd make a good couple. - Cleo... - What? - You're 17. So what? Demi Moore got married at 17. And her man was 29. Demi Moore isn't exactly a reference. Cleo? I'll be right there. - Hey. - Hi, aunt Arianne. What are you doing here? No school? Oh, no, I wasn't feeling great today. Oh my darling, come here. Sorry I haven't come round, I've been so busy with the merger... Yeah, I get it. Over-time, weekends, I'm here with my colleagues... Anyway... How are things at Gran's? Yeah... It's going better. Sure? Call me if things aren't good. We're family for a reason. - Yeah, I'll call. - I mean it. Is that your friend? This is Leos. - Leos? - Yes. I don't think we've met. I'm a good friend of Cleo's. And how do you know each other? - From CLUB 7. - Yes. We haven't known each other long. I see. Have you heard anything? No, they were going to ring me. They must be able to find images, everyone has a smartphone nowadays. The marks on the car, anything new? They'll call me when I can see the case report. Come on, how long does that take?! Unbelievable! I'm calling Leroi. He's one of the best lawyers in Brussels, he knows everyone. He's an ex-boyfriend. I'll visit as soon as I can. And if I hear anything, I'll call you. - Don't tell Gran about Leos. - OK. - Look after yourself. - Yep. Goodbye. Bye Granny. See you later. Bye-bye. Hey! What's wrong with you!? Asshole! - Idiot! - What's wrong with you!? You crazy?! - Don't touch my car! - Motherfucker. - Don't hit my car! - Fuck you! Hands off me! - He nearly died, asshole! - Calm down. Why are you here? - You following me? - Calm down. You're too upset. He nearly hit a pedestrian. Calm down. It's OK. - You want a lift to school? - I'm not going to school today. - Come on, Cleo. - What?! And no way I'm getting in your car. I fucking hate cars. No need to be scared with me. I'm not scared, especially not of you. I didn't say that. - Do I look scared, is that it? - No, no... You've come to save me again, have you? You think I don't dare get into your fucking car? Go on, open it up. Here, this is yours. Are you alright? Yes. Stop, I... I have to get out! Stop, I want to get out. Stop, stop, stop. Cleo! We've scrapped Cleo's swim classes, she's missed so many classes and her truancy is getting worse. Her marks have got drastically worse. - Truancy? - Yes, truancy. Excuse me... - Has she been skipping classes? - Yes. She skips a lot of classes, yes. You know how depressed she is. To start with we were very tolerant but after six months we can't accept it anymore. She wasn't at school today. - Today? - Yes. I wasn't aware of that. Really? She's changed a lot since the accident. She's lost all sense of responsibility. Her new friends are a bad influence. Her academic results are going from worse to worse. I think we should get a social worker to help Cleo. If she goes on like this we'll have to suspend her. She's lost her parents, hasn't she suffered enough? Yes, of course I... Really! You should be ashamed. Do you have children? No. I thought as much. Excuse me. Yes. You're a real Van Daele. - Again? - Yes. - Good evening, Granny. - Good evening, Bruno. Go to your room, I need to talk to your sister. We were doing the four hands. Go to your room. So Cleo? Did you have fun today? Where were you? Where, Cleo? In Dilbeek. I saw the school director, apparently you've been skipping classes. And it's not the first time. Is that true? She made it clear, go on like that you'll get expelled. I want you to stop seeing that Myra. - Why? - She's a bad influence. I don't know if I'm a bad guardian but they want a social worker to look after you. Fuck's sake. I'm 70 years old. Do you think it's easy for me to raise two children? I wasn't exactly given a choice. You're right. I'm to blame for their deaths. I can't talk about it because no-one knows what it feels like to lose your parents. Everyone is just weird around you. I'd gone out to the CLUB 7. My parents were at a concert of my dad's. They insisted on coming to get me. I could have gone to the concert but I wanted to go out instead. Wrong choice. I drove them to their fucking deaths. I drove them to their deaths by going to that stupid party. Cleo... It's not your fault. If I'd called a taxi... then... You can't think like that. Can you remember anything from the accident? No. I was asleep on the back seat. Everything went so fast. I woke with the crash. My parents were unconscious. And nobody saw anything? No. No, the police don't know anything. There are no cameras at the canal. Everything's derelict there. There was no-one around. I sometimes wonder if they'll ever find anything. I want to know who did it. What would you do if you knew? I want to know why that person destroyed my life. And Bruno's life too. I want to know why they fled. I don't get it. How can you run when you know it's your fault? When you know people are drowning? He'll be punished. Are Mum and Dad ever coming back? No. No, they can't come back. So where are they? I don't know. They must be somewhere. They're buried, aren't they? And how come they are dead? Do you feel better? I'm OK. It's going to be alright. Very good. - You've improved enormously. - Really? What do you think of playing this at the academy's end-of-year concert? - Seriously? - Yes. Thank you, Mr Peeters. The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing Hello, Leos's voicemail. Leave something after the beep... - Arianne, the guest first. - Thank you. Bruno. - It's Mum's recipe. - Oh, come on! Why did you say that? Look sweetie. Super tasty potatoes. Have a taste. Sit up, dear. I want to become vegetarian. Hand me the plate, Cleo. - Do you want some wine, Cleo? - Yes. Thanks. - Merry Christmas everyone. - Merry Christmas. - Hello? - Yes... - Hello? - Yes, hello? - Yes, I'm looking for Leos. - Leos? - I've come for Leos. - Wait. - I'll open. - Yes, thanks. Leos? Leos! Come inside, come! Come with me. Come. Come on. Why do you hang up all these birth cards? They're from friends. Some people get on with their lives. What happened to you? Hey? Why do you do this to yourself? I want to help you, Leos. You don't know what I have to fight against. Then tell me. Maybe we should just stop seeing each other. No. No, I don't want that. Good morning. Are you feeling a bit better? I feel ten years older. And you're already so old. Thanks a lot. I'm glad you came yesterday. I hope you mean it. I feel better already. Listen... I'm playing a piano piece at the academy tomorrow. The end-of-year concert. Would you like to come? What are you going to play? Prelude opus 3, number 2 by Rachmaninov. Classy. Tomorrow, Dilbeek academy, 11 o'clock? You owe me. Bye Leos. Ladies and Gentlemen, now we will hear Cleo Van Daele, high grade 2, from Mr Peeters' piano class. She will play the famous prelude in C sharp minor, opus 3, number 2, by Sergei Rachmaninov. Please show your appreciation for Cleo Van Daele. Are you alright? Your father would have been so proud of you. Well done. I knew you would be the star of the concert. - You're a real Van Daele. - Yes! Thank you. I'll be right back. Leos. You were there. I didn't know you were so talented. Unbelievable! Thanks, and thanks for coming. - I owed you. - Do you know him? - No. Well, actually yes, I saw him in Brussels once. I see... Listen, have you got plans for tonight? Tonight? Ehm, well... Playing a bit of GTA 5 maybe... OK. I have two concert tickets for Rachmaninov. At the Paris Philharmonic. It's a unique concert. - Would you like to come? - Paris, Cleo? You're a racer, aren't you? You're scared of cars, aren't you? The tickets were for my parents. You want me to throw them away? What about your family? Leos, I want to go to Paris. Tonight. With you. Yeah... Come on, let's go. Gran - Gran... - I'm staying in town. Kiss. I can do it. Are you crazy!? What? Crazy about you, yes. Let's take a romantic selfie on the bonnet. Come on. Leos, for a laugh! - Please don't. - Yes, come on! The two of us on your car, it'll be great. - Get off there! - Are you scared I'll scratch it? - Get off there! - No, come and get me. What's your problem, man? What's up with you? Did I do something wrong? Well? Sorry. You don't need to say sorry. What's wrong? I'm a really good driver, Cleo. Yeah, I know you are. I misjudged the distance because I was driving too fast. What are you on about? Hey? I wanted to tell you for ages... I even wrote you a letter, but when I got to know you I couldn't anymore. Leos, what are you on about? I had... drunk a few too many beers. A few. Not a lot, but... I fled. From the shock. I left you behind. It's my fault. My fault. The only thing I wanted, was to find you to help you... To help... Fuck! - Are you going to Paris? - Yes. Can I come with you? - Get in. - Thanks. Oh my baby. In loving memory of Jacques Van Daele & Eline Dierickx, parents of Cleo and Bruno. A farewell, too soon and unexpected. A new card for your clothes line. Bye Leos. De Wachter The traffic expert's examination showed that your father's vehicle deviated from the lane it was in, drifting from the right to the left lane. In the left lane, your father's vehicle was hit by an unknown vehicle and the driver of this vehicle committed a hit and run offence. Now, to the question of why driver Van Daele departed from his lane, there are various hypotheses. The first, is that driver Van Daele overtook a slower-driving vehicle via the left lane. However, no data indicates there was an overtaken vehicle. Second hypothesis: driver Van Daele was very inattentive and did not realise his vehicle had drifted over onto the left lane. Driver Van Daele may have been distracted or talking to other occupants. Third hypothesis: the possibility exists that Mr Van Daele may have dozed off and consequently drifted onto the left lane. In the given situation, for the unknown driver who committed the hit-and-run offence, the accident was unavoidable if he was driving over the speed limit. They therefore call it a shared responsibility. Did you really feel or see nothing in the car? You can't remember anything? I can't remember anything. In memory of Ilse Schaerlaecken
