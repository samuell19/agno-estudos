- I have awakened. I am coming. [dramatic music] [tense music] - Damn it, Waymar. [suspenseful music] [knocking on door] [machine beeping] - He looks completely benign. - We have him immobilized and heavily sedated. - Is there any sign of new intelligence? - Our most recent diagnostic has had promising results. - Thanks for almost running me over, Waymar. - That's Director Waymar and I apologize. Although, I was under the impression that this was a government research facility, not a day spa. - Research is no excuse for not staying in shape. And I'm not referring to you by your job title. I don't work for your agency. So, this is him. - Yes. Test subject Wilkes. - No first name? - Under the circumstances of which he was born, he's lucky to have any name. We've been keeping him sedated, but he's had several periods of lucid interaction. He's even learned to talk. - We believe that we've identified how the virus penetrated the blood-brain barrier. - That's unimportant. Your job will now be to assist Professor Arnett and her team. They'll be taking over the research from here on out. - I'm sorry, I don't understand. - As far as the government is concerned, Project Seven has been terminated effective immediately. That's why we've cleared out the scientific team and the military staff. As far as the facility is concerned, well that's still under my jurisdiction, so no one will question why I keep it operational for the next week. Until he can provide conclusive results, only you, the professor, and her students will have access to the test subject. - We should at least revive him. - No, I prefer to keep him sedated for the time being. As a matter of fact, we're considering euthanizing him and performing a complete biopsy. - He's 18 years old and in perfect health. In all probability, I could save him. - No, it's becoming too risky to keep him alive. - I'm not a coroner, Waymar. If you want me and my students to do your dirty work, we'll do it on a live subject, not on a corpse. - Director Waymar. - I said I was considering it. For the time being, we have an opportunity to study the subject off the reservation, so to speak. I suggest you do whatever you can to help the professor this week, Dr. Lyons. You have your orders. When is the rest of your team due to arrive? - In about an hour. - Good. Get them settled in and then have them go over all the data on hand as quickly as possible. - What happens when I have to explain about the origin of your test subject? - You won't. That's classified information. If anyone ask about that kind of thing, simply tell them that Wilkes is autistic. That shouldn't jeopardize their findings at all. I don't think I have to tell you what happens if the Pentagon gets wind of this before we're ready to show them the results. - 18 years of research. A man's life has been taken away from him and we're just gonna discard him like a piece of trash? - I don't like it any better than you. - Okay, Wilkes aside. How can they eliminate all of our data? - New administration. They believe this is junk science. Paranoid alien conspiracy on par with Roswell. - If that's so, then explain to me how a college professor and a bunch of grad students can take over a top secret government experiment. - Waymar and I go back to the original project 19 years ago before she became field director for the agency. I am probably the only person she can trust. As for my kids, they're the best in the field. After all, I am the one who taught them. - What would you like me to do? - Tend to Wilkes. We'll continue to keep him sedated for now. I have to go meet my students. [machine beeping] [tense music] - They're not gonna kill you. I won't let them.

I want you to unpack the truck and then get set up in the dorm rooms. Ash, Peter, and Doug, you'll be bunking together. - Peter snores. - Shut up. - [Arnett] Kyle, I want you and Brendan to share one of the other dorms. - Oh, no. Actually, I'm gonna share one with Jennifer. - Actually, this is 90% of your graduate studies, not spring break. So you'll be rooming with Brendan. You get your own room. And please try to keep it that way, okay? - What? - Be good. And don't fight for a change, okay? It'll be fine. We're here to work, not play. - Look, I'm not a little kid anymore. You have to stop treating me like one. - What I have got to do is get some work done, same as you. When we talked about you coming on this project, I thought that we understood that you'd get serious about your PhD, not your girlfriend. - No, you understood that. I was just kind of standing there and listening. I mean, I didn't even want to go to college in the first place. Listen, I sure as hell didn't want you as a teacher. - Don't argue with me, Kyle. - Cheer up, man. I look better in a nightie than Jennifer does anyway. [sighs] - It's gonna be a long week. [tense music] [machine beeping] How's our patient? - He's doing well. - So are you, it seems. - I've come to terms with the situation. - Good. My students are getting settled. As soon as they're ready I'm gonna have them start going over all the data we have on file. Think I'll give it a day or so before introducing them to our sleeping friend here. - I look forward to it. I'm sure he does, too. [tense music] - [Ash] I don't get this whole business. - [Peter] What whole business? - This. This whole business. Did you guys catch the signs coming into this place? This is government property. - Ash, this is just a government owed conference center. They have places like this all over the country. - Yeah, what's the big deal? - The big deal? Why have a bunch of grad students come in here and examine some autistic patient in the middle of nowhere in a government facility? I mean, doesn't that strike you as a little odd? - Not really. But then again, I'm not a conspiracy freak. - Okay, here's another point. You and I, biology students. Specifically, neurology. Doug, what are you? - I'm psych. Arnett recruited me from Professor Wilcox's class for this. - Psychology, there you go. What's Jennifer's major? - Biology. Same as us. - Right. And what's her secondary? Neurology. So, you're telling me a medical team hasn't gone over this guy's brain with a fine-toothed comb already? I mean, what's the deal? Why have some autism patient in the middle of nowhere and hook 50 million dollars worth of gear into him? There's more to this than they're telling us. - If you say so. - Well, he does have a point, Peter. I mean, why have a bunch of grad students go on a week-long retreat to some government compound in the mountains? Why not just have us go to a regular mental hospital and study patients there or, I don't know, the zoo and study the animals? - Exactly. - Listen, the impression I got from this is that we're just helping out some army bigwig that Arnett knows. If this was something important, don't you think there'd be real government scientists in a real government facility where they wouldn't let information get leaked to the public? It makes no sense. My advice, stop reading every post you see you get your daily news. - Well, you kids have fun arguing semantics. I'm gonna go meet the professor regarding the alien test subject. We need to figure out where that spaceship crashed. - Not funny. [tense music] - Not to presume anything, Professor, but what does this have to do with the test subject? - A lot of the records I've been looking over regarding this place just doesn't add up. Lots of hemorrhaging in the local wildlife. - You mean like exposure to certain frequencies? - Bingo. Limited exposure, nothing happens. Prolonged exposure and anything with overly-sensitive hearing could potentially die. - What could cause something like that? - Strange acoustics, maybe. I just want to make sure that we're not being exposed to anything that we shouldn't be. So I figured while we're here, we'd just do a little audio work. - What am I listening for? - Something not indigenous to this region, I'd imagine. [tones squealing] Do you hear something? - Yeah. I can't place the algorithms. It almost sounds deliberate. Manmade. - [Arnett] Maybe. I've never heard anything like it. - [Brendan] I'll transfer the file to my MP3 player. - [Arnett] Thanks, I'll analyze it later. - Mind if I talk to you for a moment? - Sure. - I want to be your lead in the field. I'm well versed in mapping, sequencing, and annotating genomes, phylogenetic analysis, micro array technology, proteomics, comparative genomics, systems biology, SMP analysis, and meta genomics. - I am quite familiar with your resume, Brendan. That's why you're here. - Then I get the job? - No. - No? I'm more qualified than any of them. - Now, by the end of the week you're gonna thank me for not giving you more than your fair share of work. Finish up recording that file and then head to the main building and talk to Dr. Lyons. Maybe he can gather up some of the information we're gonna need to start. Okay? [sighs] - [Kyle] I should not have come out here. - [Jennifer] Why not? - I've spent my whole life in my mom's shadow doing whatever she asked me to do. I don't even get to spend any time with you. I do not want to be out here. - Well, we're here because we're doing a complete analysis on an autistic boy. - Yeah, that's what Mom says. I've heard it. - You're here because you're an excellent student. And Professor Arnett believes in you. - No. I'm here because she wants to keep tabs on me. - You have a great career ahead of you as a biologist. Why would you want to throw all that away? - You know, because no one's ever asked me what I wanted to do with my life. And sometimes, I just. - Hey, I'm here. Isn't that enough enticement to stay? And besides, we can always sneak out after hours. [moaning] [panting] [chuckles] - You should, uh. You should get going. We have to run that test on the patient soon. [laughs] - It's okay, you know. We're both adults here. - I know, but you just happen to be my student. It's unethical. Look. Kyle doesn't know anything about this and I'd like to keep it that way, okay? - All right. - Talking to Professor Arnett? - Yeah, we were just going over a few things. What are you doing here? - I'm supposed to assist the medical technician with assembling some of the data. Unlike you, I actually have to work to make my grades. [subdued music] [machine beeping] Dr. Lyons? You should still be completely under. [grunting] [tone droning] - You disappeared awfully quick after unpacking. - I've been working. - And spending time with Jennifer. - There's nothing else to do. - Listen, we're about to start analyzing the data on Wilkes. - Sorry if I'm not that excited about it. - So you've decided to hide out here in the kitchen and wash dishes instead? - Look, if we were home, you'd be thrilled that I was doing the dishes. - Why did you decide to come on this field trip, Kyle? - I don't recall having a choice. - Did I make you this cynical? - You didn't have anything to do with who I am. - You're right. Kyle, you have the potential to be a brilliant scientist. Now that talent came from you, not from me. I brought you here because I need your expertise. The other students need your expertise. I'm gonna be in the field all afternoon. Can we have dinner? - Well, I was gonna go over the analysis that you gave us and then go for a walk with Jennifer. But I can meet you afterwards. - Great. Kyle, listen. I am not against you dating her. She's very beautiful, very intelligent. What I have a problem with is the fact that you put your relationship with her ahead of your studies. Leaving us so soon? Did you provide Brendan with your notes? - Excuse me? - I didn't know that you were planning on going anywhere. I was under the impression that Waymar wanted all of us on site for the duration of the research. - Well, I didn't understand there were such restrictions. - I'm going to be passing out assignments in a few moments. Most of my students will be analyzing Wilkes' brain patterns and looking for anomalies in his biological data. The others will be doing an in-depth DNA analysis. That means you have to be there with the subject. I trust my kids, but only you and I know enough about the subject to supervise this. - Honestly, Wilkes is harmless. He's in a chemically induced coma. I doubt that your researchers are either gonna be in any significant harms way when they're with the subject one on one, or discover anything that they're gonna run off to the press with. Now, if you'll excuse me. - You are supposed to help us with this. - I didn't know that I couldn't run to town for some supplies. - You know, off the record, last summer alone there were seven dead grizzly bears, 15 dead raccoons, and 47 dead rabbits discovered in this region. All experienced acoustically induced hemorrhages resulting in bleeding around the eyes and ears. They didn't exactly die of old age and natural causes, if you get my drift. So what is Waymar not telling us? Why are we really here? - Well, you seem to know the nature of this facility better than anyone, Professor. Maybe it was weapons testing. - Oh, bull. This place doesn't test weapons. It's not even equipped for that. It was a conference center that Waymar converted specifically for this test subject. At one point there were more scientists and meta physicists here than at an office party at MIT. How about filling me in on Wilkes. What did he do when he was awake, huh? - I'll be back soon. We can talk later. Excuse me. [engine starts] [tense music] - Who was that? - Okay. I want everybody to divide into teams. I want one team to do a complete medical workup on the subject just as we planned. Jennifer's already started going over the CAT scans we have on file. Peter, you're our software programmer. I want you and Kyle to get to work on the on-site mainframe. See if you can break any encryptions on the restricted files. - I thought we were just strictly doing an analysis on the patient. - We are. I'm just trying to gather all the information. Especially the stuff we're not supposed to have. [tense music] [phone beeping] - This is Lyons, Terra Nova Duo Three. Requesting a communications lockdown for military restriction zone Zeta Charlie One. Again, I'm requesting a communications lockdown for military restricted zone Zeta Charlie One. All cellular transmissions, landline transmissions, long and short band radio, and Earth to satellite transmissions are to be blocked from this location grid. - [Woman On Phone] Copy that, Terra Nova Duo Three. Can you give us a reason for this request? I'm showing that this facility is no longer in operation. - Exactly. [suspenseful music] [sighs] - What's wrong? - Have you tried hooking up to the net since you've gotten here? I just tried to connect to the college database and the Wi-Fi doesn't seem to want to cooperate. [keyboard clacking] - That's weird. Maybe it's your computer. - It's a brand new laptop. - Maybe it's the fact that we're in the boonies and we're lucky to have running water, let alone a broadband connection. What are you looking up anyway? - There's weird anomalies in Wilkes' Cat scan. They just don't add up. - Okay, well. I'm assuming we're here because, you know, this is a special case. - Yeah, but this has nothing to do with the patient's autism. See here. There's what appears to be a tumor located near the pineal gland. Then here on a scan taken a week later, no tumor. It varies. If this were actually a tumor, it would constantly be present. Larger or smaller. But this just disappears and reappears sporadically. - Looks like faulty gear to me. - Yeah, but then there would also be a constant. A tech would've flagged it. Whatever this is, it's coming and going for no rhyme or reason. Ever hear of a tumor that hides from the camera? - Well, maybe I should do a new scan. If there's something amiss here I'll know after I do about 40 compares on his DNA analysis. By the way, the professor wants us all out front. She's handing out assignments. - But this is my assignment. - Sounds like things have changed a little. Anyway, I think Brendan's lurking around somewhere around here. If you see him, tell him what's going on. - You bet. - Remember to come up for air. [phone beeping] [pulsing tone] - You've got to be kidding me. [sighs] Hey. Ash was just looking for you. He said something about the professor handing out new assignments. Hey, have you tried calling out on your cell since you've gotten here? It's like nothing works around here. - I'm sure it's just interference from the mountains. - Are you okay? I think you're bleeding. - Oh, I'm fine. Just fine. - So who's taking lead in the field? - Ash. - Brendan is not gonna be happy to hear about that. - I know. I already talked to him. - So why Ash and not me? - It's not a popularity contest, Doug. Ash is the most qualified. The end. Anyway, you guys are gonna have your hands full just breaking down the DNA analysis on Wilkes for me. - Sure I can't persuade you? - This has to end. - Why? - Because we can't keep doing this. Here I am yelling at my son for not having his priorities straight and I'm guilty of it myself. - What are you doing? - Checking to make sure the truck is completely unpacked. I need to take it into town. - Why? - Call it a slight case of mistrust. As in, I don't trust our babysitter, Dr. Lyons. [engine cranking] What do you know about fixing cars? - I can change a spark plug. - You're one up on me. Could you take a look at the engine? [sighs] - [Doug] You might want to see this for yourself. - Now I really don't trust Dr. Lyons. - This is about the last thing I want to be doing this week. - You and me both. - I mean, does Mom really think there's going to be top secret files laying around on the computer for people to find? - They're not just leaving it laying around. They've hidden it somewhere. That's why Professor Arnett wants us to find it. - You're starting to sound like Ash. - Yeah? Maybe, maybe not, but beats looking at some dude's EKG for a week. - Well, no top secret files in there. Congratulations, Mom. You've officially gone insane. - None here either and this is the main server. I guess whatever they didn't want us to see, they made sure to completely wipe off the hard drive. Did you know the only way they could completely secure a hard drive. - Is to drill a hole through it so it can never be read again. Yeah, I've heard that. They can reconstruct the contents of an entire drive through a few unerased file fragments. It's paranoid conspiracy theory 101. I mean, I've also heard the one about finding hidden files in the computer's trash. - Trash. - What are you doing? - Old school DOS command. Makes all invisible files visible. Guess they didn't hear about paranoid conspiracy theory 101. - Most of this stuff is useless. Maintenance garbage, backups. Except this one here. - File W-1. Synthetic Fertilization Project. Intelligence memo. Origin classified. Classified? - How much of this document do we have on here? - Not much, but I can maybe reconstruct one or two pages from whatever data still exists. Why? It's got nothing to do with this project. - It doesn't? Come on. Let's go find my mom. Hey, we might have found something. - [Arnett] What? - [Kyle] All the hard drives on the mainframe were wiped, except for one file. - A confidential document. Looks like it could be nothing. - Okay, well I'm gonna have to look at it in a while. Right now we've got a bigger problem. - Ooh. Whoa. Who did this? - We don't know. Maybe Dr. Lyons. - I don't suppose either one of you can rebuild an engine, huh? - Ash is a pretty good mechanic. - Okay. I mean, why would Dr. Lyons mess up the engine? - We don't know. He was acting strange a while ago and then he took his car out. - There aren't any other vehicles around? - They dropped me off. This is it. - Couldn't we just call some of your army buddies to see if they could help us out? - We tried. Cell phones and internet are down. - So we're stuck here? - Not necessarily. One of you find Ash. See if he can fix the truck. The rest of us will bunk down for the night. Maybe take shifts, keep an eye on our test subject. If Dr. Lyons isn't back by morning, we'll take a hike down the mountainside and see if we can't make it into town. - That's 20 miles. - I'm aware of how far it is, Kyle. Find everybody else and tell them what's going on. - But I don't want to go. - Do it. We're rounding up the group. Our work with Wilkes is suspended for the time being. - What's wrong? - I'll fill you in later. - Your ear's bleeding. [heart beating] [tense music] [water rushing] - Whoa. Did I interrupt something? - Doesn't anyone ever knock anymore? - The door was open. Anyway, Brendan was already in here. - I was just on my way to get you. - Well, now that we have a party in here, what's up, guys? - I heard you were looking for me. Something about the truck. - Yeah, Mom said that Dr. Lyons messed up the engine. - [Ash] Holy crap. Why would he do that? - I have no idea, but you're the only dude here who can fix it. - Okay, well that makes two major surprises. - Two? - There's a slight problem with our test subject. [machine beeping] - When did this happen? - Who knows. I mean, people have been coming in and out of here all day. - And nobody saw the kid walking around the compound in his underwear? I thought he was doing some sort of artificial coma or something. - Somebody woke him up. - All right. You go take a look at the truck. I gotta show Mom. [knocking on door] Mom, we gotta talk. - [Arnett] What's going on? - Look, we have a serious problem. Dr. Lyons gave Wilkes something that brought him out of his coma. And now he's missing. What the hell is this? - Look, I was gonna tell you. - Oh, I could just imagine. How could you do this, Doug? - Look, if you're gonna get mad at somebody, get mad at me, not at him. - I'm already angry at you. - Get dressed. I'm really sorry. This is over. Kyle. - All this crap about focusing on my work. I can't believe this. We're practically the same age. Let's not forget the fact that he's your student. - What can I say? I screwed up. - Yeah, you screwed up. Big surprise. - What's this? - While you were in there playing grading curve with Doug, your buddy Dr. Lyons slipped some of that to the test subject. Now he's missing. Dr. Lyons is still missing. We're stranded. Suddenly, I'm not as worried about my PhD as I am about what freaky thing's about to happen next. - Why would Dr. Lyons give the test subject hormones? - You tell me. Are there any other secrets about this field trip that I should know? - No, I don't have any. - The truth, Mom. - All right. 19 years ago I was part of a government experiment. They wanted to test fertility in space. They needed someone to donate an egg and I had clearance. I was in perfect health. No genetic issues. So I was picked. Another scientist named Wilkes donated his sperm and the fertilization happened in orbit during a shuttle mission. - So Wilkes is my half brother? - Clinically speaking, yes. The experiment was successful. But when the fetus came to term in the incubator, they noticed some anomalies. - What kind of anomalies? - I have no idea. I assumed it was some form of autism, but in truth, I was off the project by then. - Why are they keeping it such a big secret? - I don't know. All the top brass seem to think it was something caused by fertilizing a human egg in space. That it caused some kind of mutation. Can you imagine the harm that could've been done to the space program? I mean, there could be no colonization on other planets because people would be too afraid that their children would have genetic defects. - So they just keep him out here for his whole life? - Yes, they were going to close the project down. Waymar was my superior on the original project and she knew that I could do last-minute research on the subject and probably find some data that the other scientists had missed. Plus, she knew my connection to him. - Good. Well, I'm glad somebody did. - Where are you going? - First, I'm going to go find your test subject. Then make sure Ash gets the truck fixed. Once he does, I want out of this place, out of your class, and just out of your life. - Now, wait. - [Kyle] Don't bother. I don't want to hear any more of your lies. [heart beating] [tense music] [tone droning] [heart beating] - You're dreaming. - I wasn't asleep. - Okay, so I lied. It's more like a transmission. - How are you doing this? - I can do much more than what they're telling you. Though by now I suspect Mother already told you the connection between you and I. - More or less. - She told you we were brothers, but she didn't tell you the rest. - You developed some sort of in-vitro autism from being fertilized in space. - In-vitro autism. You should listen to yourself. What you know about the genetic makeup of your own species couldn't fill a thimble. - If it's not autism, what is it? - Let's just say millions of light years from here there's a race of creatures, highly intelligent, but their planet was dying. They didn't have time to develop interstellar space travel, so they encoded a collective awareness of their entire species onto a highly sophisticated sound transmission and then beamed it into space. Hoping that one day it would encounter a weaker mind for them to control. - And sound travels slower than light. - Exactly. Which is why when it got to your part of the universe, it wasn't strong enough to penetrate Earth's atmosphere. Nor say the blood-brain barrier of an adult astronaut. Lucky for us it encountered a shuttle mission doing experimental fertilization of human sperm and egg. Thus, opportunity knocked, so to speak. - So you're saying. - I'm an alien. Well, technically a hybrid. But I control this body and I can control others. As the alpha male, it's my responsibility to reseed my population with yours. - Great. So just come take me over then. Why all the exposition? - Because you're my brother. They lied to you. You can let me in willingly. It would make it easier for both of us. Once I become a part of you, you will never age, never die. I could even give you Jennifer, if that's what you want. Think of the possibilities. Once we have control of your species, there will be no more wars, no more poverty. - Yeah? What happened to your race? How did they die out? Was everybody just picking daisies and eating sunshine all day? - Don't deny me. - This is some half-cocked dream, okay? I've seen your charts. You shouldn't even be able to form a complete sentence. Let alone use your crazy mind powers to take over the human race. If I'm dreaming, I want to be dreaming about Jennifer. [exhales sharply] - Subject Wilkes believed to have had an in-vitro exposure to extraterrestrial gene-altering radiation. Second set of brainwave activity documented on EKG. Origin unknown. Possibly not human. - Where are you going, Peter? - Gotta tell the professor something. It's about Wilkes. - I can't let you do that. See, if you show the professor before we're ready, it'll ruin everything. - What are you talking about? - This. [tone droning] - Hey, how's it coming? - Well, unless you know where we can get a new radiator, possibly a new fuel injector, I'd say we're dead in the water. Whoever messed this engine up did a pretty thorough job. - Great. - What about you? - I've been over every inch of this place and I can't find Wilkes anywhere. I did find this though. - Where? - Out in the middle of the woods. I had a hell of a dream, too. - Maybe Lyons smuggled him out in his car. - Maybe. - Now, your mom's talking about taking a couple of us down with her. You know, try to hike back to civilization. You down? - No. You guys have fun with that. I'm gonna stick around here. At the very least, the military knows we're here. They should come check out why the phone's are all dead. You seen Peter around? - Yeah, I think he's still over in the computer room. - Wow. Someone's actually doing their job around here. I'm shocked. - I think somebody wants to talk to you. - Aren't you a sight for sore eyes. - Let's take a walk. - Now's not a good time. - Now's a great time. You've been up all night, haven't you? - Yeah. - Let's get away for a few moments. I promise, it'll be worth your while. [tense music] - I think I should come with you. - And I think everybody should stay here together. I can make this walk just fine on my own. Where's my students? - Kyle's been out looking for Wilkes all night. Ash is working on the truck. Brendan's been helping either Kyle or Ash. And Jennifer's probably with one of them. - And where's Peter? - Last I saw him he was in the computer room. - Oh, my god. I have a medical kit in my suitcase. Go get it. - What happened? - He might've got struck in the head. Go! Come on. Peter. - What? Where am I? - You're in the computer room. How did this happen? - I was on my way to see you and I ran into Brendan. - Did he do this? - No. He did something to my ear or tried to. I don't know. - You might have ruptured your eardrum. - No. I already did when I was eight. I have a cochlear implant. - All right, well let me see. No. The damage is superficial. And they seem to be okay. It doesn't explain why we found you out cold on the floor though. - That looks like something I saw yesterday. - [Arnett] You saw someone's ear bleeding yesterday? - Yeah. Jennifer's. I don't know. I thought she cut her ear or something. She didn't even seem to notice it, so it slipped my mind until just now. Why? What's wrong? Is it contagious? - I don't know. I don't know what it is. This looks like a membrane rupture. There's been a lot of dead animals found in this area with the same condition. Just go find Jennifer. I will follow you out shortly. - I think Brendan did something to the files we were working on. He said that you weren't supposed to know about it yet. - Know about what? - From what I pieced together, it had something to do with Wilkes. Some old government document. I think it had to do with extraterrestrial contamination. - Okay. I want you to stay here, lock the door after I leave, and don't let anyone in except me. Do you understand? - Not even for Kyle? - Not even for Kyle. - [Kyle] You all right? - [Jennifer] Yes. Tell me about your mother. - That's about the last person I want to be talking about right now. - She has expertise in bio-plasma physics, correct? - You'd know as well as I would, I guess. - Plasma physics can be useful in the investigation of the physical properties of living cells. - Hey, I'm all about investigating the physical. - You want to be with me? - Yeah. - Then join me. - Where are you going? - Hey. - Sorry about that. Trust me, it was necessary. Have you seen Kyle around recently? - Yeah. He and Jennifer went for a walk in the woods. - Okay. Well, you're gonna have to show me exactly where they went. - Why? - Let's just say their lives depend on it. - Look, I still gotta work on the engine here. [tires squealing] - Forget about the engine. - Okay, why are we whispering? - I'll explain everything later. Right now, we need to find Kyle. - This way, come on. - Okay. [tense music] - Now's the time. - Really? - I want you to. - Now? - [Jennifer] Now. - Wait. [branch thuds] - [Ash] Are you trying to tell me that Kyle's in danger? - [Arnett] I hope not. - Why were we hiding from Dr. Lyons? - Because I have a strange feeling that he is responsible for all of this. Are you sure that they went down this path? - This is the direction I saw them going. - Then I'm gonna keep following it on my own. Here's what I need you to do. I need you to get to Dr. Lyon's car. I need you to drive it down into town and contact the agency at this number. Ask for Field Director Waymar. Tell her that it's an emergency. That this entire area's been compromised. Do you think you can do that for me? - So you want me to just leave everybody here and drive off? - That's exactly what I want you to do. And don't trust anyone, not even your friends. In fact, if you can stay hidden until you get into the car, that would be good. Okay? - But I don't understand. - Listen to me. This is some kind of infection and it's getting into people's minds. And I don't know how, but it is. If you come in contact with anyone, they can infect you as well. Now please, just go. Oh, Doug. Did you find Kyle yet? - No. - Okay, well he can't be too far away from here. You didn't run into anybody since you've been out here, did you? - No. - Okay, good. Follow me. [heart beating] [tone droning] [dramatic music] [tone droning] - [Brendan] Ash? - Leave me alone, Brendan. - [Brendan] No, it's fine. I just want you to listen to me, okay? - Okay. - Something's wrong with Professor Arnett. Maybe Kyle too, but definitely the professor. - What do you mean? - [Brendan] She might've been infected by something. - Well, that's funny 'cause that's what she keeps saying about you guys. - [Brendan] Fair enough. I know how this looks, Ash. And I don't blame you for being paranoid. Hell, I'd be paranoid right now if I were you. But you have to trust me. She got something weird off that test subject. Dr. Lyons explained the whole thing to me. - Oh, really? Dr. Lyons? Why did he try to grab me just now? - He was probably trying to talk to you. - Really? - Look, this whole thing is a giant mix-up. We weren't even supposed to be here. The professor bought us out here because she hoped the rest of us would be infected by that Wilkes guy and she could study the results. - And how did you manage not to get infected all this time, Brendan? - Just let me in, Ash. We can sort this whole thing out. We'll call the police, the army. Whoever you want to talk to, we can explain it to them. - You should've just let us through the front door. It would be a lot less painful. [tone droning] You feel better now? - Much better. - Then let's get the others. [tense music] - Kyle. Thank god. - I think I killed her. - No, she's fine. You just knocked her out. - She kept trying to do something to me. She kept trying to put her mouth on my ear. - You did the right thing. She could've infected you. - I didn't mean to hurt her. - Okay, enough, all right? I need you here, Kyle. Do you understand me? Good. Jennifer couldn't help herself. Look at the blood coming out of her ear. Someone infected her just like she was trying to do to you. Now, come on. I gotta get you out of here. - I can't. I have to stay here until she gets better. - No. Whatever got to her, we can't help her. We'll go get some help. You're gonna have to trust me, Kyle. - Okay. - Come on. We gotta go. [heart beating] [tense music] - It's time for end game. - [Wilkes] Hello, Mother. Hello again, Kyle. I can't enter you physiologies from here, but I can certainly talk to you. No doubt that Kyle has already told you about my special abilities with family members. No? Well, I can either enter your dreams or talk directly into your minds. - What do you want? - [Wilkes] Your bodies, of course. I want my people to survive. - Right. Of course you do. Come on. I don't suppose you know how to hot wire a car? - No. - That's where a juvenile delinquent would come in handy. Hey, we gotta go. - Where are we gonna go? - Computer room. We can barricade ourselves in there. Let's go. - You're making this harder than it has to be. - How did you know we were coming? - I patched to the security system. - Look, are you sure he's not one of them? - No. He has a cochlear implant. However these things are spreading their virus, they're using the inner ear membrane to do it. - Sound waves. - [Arnett] What? - Look, I saw that guy Wilkes in a dream and he told me that their species travels throughout the universe using sound waves. - That makes about as much sense as anything else going on here. Anyway, they probably think that Peter is one of them. - Guess again, Mother. - Oh. Hello, Wilkes. Sedative. Not enough to affect your mind. Just enough to scramble his transmissions. So, is this a professional call, or a social visit? - Have Peter check the other security cameras, won't you? You're surrounded, Mother. You have no way out of that room. Eventually, I will get in. First, your minds. Then, your bodies. - He's right. And we don't have enough sedative to block him for long either. Eventually, he'll get through to me or Kyle. - Maybe we can counteract the virus or reverse it. - We'd need a full lab and about a million tissue samples. - Maybe we need a sound sample. - Well, we don't have that either. Wait a minute. I recorded one yesterday. Whatever signal that Wilkes has been putting out for years, I assume. - Okay. So what if we reversed it? - [Arnett] The signal? - It's not too long. I can just resample it or reverse the waveform. - We don't have any way to broadcast it though. - It doesn't matter. It's not strong enough. That's why Wilkes, and everybody else, has to put their mouth directly to the victim's ear to transmit the sound. Put the reverse waveform back up on the MP3 player and load it up. Look, we don't have to take them all out. Wilkes told me that he was the progenitor, the alpha male. If we could stop him, he won't be able to control the others anymore. - What are you gonna do? - It's your turn to trust me. - All you have to do is press play. - Put Wilkes back up on the monitor. I'm ready to make a deal, Wilkes. You let Peter and my mom go, you can have me free and clear. No fighting. - I'm not here to make deals, Kyle. - We have enough sedative in here for a painless death. That way you won't be able to have me or Mom. - Come out here in the hallway and we'll see what happens. - [Arnett] You can't trade your life for ours. - I'm not and he's not either. Look, I'll be right back. [heart beating] - Hello, Kyle. - Hello, brother. - I knew you'd finally see things my way. I didn't want to fight you. We are family, after all. - I know. - But once I have you, I will control the others. - Guess again. [tone droning] [grunting] [dramatic music] [heart beating] [exhales sharply] - Well, I think this field trip was a bust. [soft piano music] - I apologize for all of this. I had no idea how dangerous Wilkes was. I certainly didn't know he carried some sort of alien contamination. - What's gonna happen to my students? - An army transport is flying in. We're going to evac them to a special hospital for a complete physical and a debriefing. - Debriefing? - Professor, you don't think that after everything they've gone through, we're just going to let them back into society without finding out everything that happened to them, do you? - I guess not. - That being said, the medics have looked them over. They show no signs of contamination. Whatever it was your son did reversed the process in all of them. Even Wilkes. After their hospital stay, they'll be free to go about their normal lives. - What if this happens again? - Absolutely not. Now that we know the risks involved. - [Kyle] Hey! - Hey, yourself. How are you holding up? - I'm okay. Look, I wanted to see if you wanted to take a ride back with me on the helicopter. - Me? Not Jennifer? - No. Look, I'll see Jennifer in a while. I kind of wanted to spend some time with you. I mean, if that's okay. - You bet. [dramatic music] [tense music]
