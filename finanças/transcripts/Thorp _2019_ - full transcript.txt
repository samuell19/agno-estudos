You grew up here? Yeah, something like that. Do you know Sam? - Sam? - She's my best friend. I'm looking for her. Hey, do you know anyone named Sam? No. Sorry, man. It's okay. Thanks. Hey, you... You gotta pay for that, boss. I do? Then the other one. Give me a second. Can I help you? Let me call you back. Can I help you? - Is it true? - What? You still have the best pancakes in the universe? Well, sure. You hungry? Have a seat, wherever you want. This is where we used to sit. Cool. Me, too. Exclamation point. Looking forward to it. Winky face emoji. - What are you doing? - Talking to my girl. You can't be back here. - Is she in there? - No, I'm serious. Back off. Stop playing. I'm sorry for yelling. You said pancakes, right? Well, it's closing time, so... I'm not saying you gotta go home, but you gotta... You'll be back for pancakes? - My name is Junior. - Mmm. Tell me your name again. Thorp. You with the senior league? They're here for another hour. But I've got an open lane for you right there, if you're alone. You're alone, aren't ya? I'm here to find Sam. Oh. Uh, what does he look like? Sam's a girl. Well, then what does she look like? She's got hair, and eyes, and... She's my best friend. Well, that's specific. When was the last time you were here? Oh, about 25 years ago. You're funny. I like you. I like you. Well, I don't know any Sam around here, but I'll keep my eyes open. If you like, I can give you a private lesson later. Give you some special attention. Thanks, but I used to go bowling with Sam all the time. Okay. If you change your mind, let me know. Oh, wanna throw one? - Really? - You're already here. Throwback Thursdays. Two bucks a game. Ooh. Big one. Twelve, 13? Hmm. Thanks. Sweet boy. Here you go. Sam? Lily. Hey, Lily. Watch this. You go, girl. Do you know Sam? No. What are you doing? Can I play, too? I'm not allowed to play with strangers. My dad said I'll get kidnapped or murdered. Have you ever kidnapped anyone? Have you ever murdered anyone? Lily, is it okay if I play with this stranger? So what if he did not like that photo? You go, girl. Okay, you go ahead then. We go under on three. One, two, three. I won. Yes, yes, yes! Wanna play again? Did you really see a shark? Next one wins, okay? Do you have money? Do you want some ice cream? Outer space? Really? So, you are an alien? I'm a Thorp. I'm not saying I believe you, but if you are a Thorp, why'd you come back here? I had to find Sam. She's my best friend. What happened? I had to leave really quickly, and I never got to say goodbye. We just moved into the house over there. I don't have any friends yet. Hmm. Can't you make some new ones? All the kids at my school don't care about anyone else. They just care about their stupid iPads and iPhones. What's an iPhones? My dad says, "If you want to connect with kids your age, "you have to disconnect from technology first." How? They won't even talk to me. Mmm. You go, girl. We should probably be friends now. What are you doing? - You scared the shit out of me. - This is Thorp. We are leaving now! Wait. He was gone for a long time, and... Olivia Walters, you go stand over there, okay? Okay. - Bye, Olivia. - You come near her again, I will shove that so far up your ass, you'll be tasting it for a week. Get out of here. Get out of here. Can you believe this? I'm live-streaming this. This is some misogynistic bullshit. I can't believe this. Oh, what the... Oh! And now, a local video that's made some waves over the Internet these past few days. - Can you believe this? - I'm live-streaming this. This is some misogynistic bullshit. Oh. "For an old friend." "Welcome home, Thorp." That's me. "I know your secret." "You're going to die." ♪ In the light of the moon ♪ In the garden we dance ♪ Oh, and everything's right ♪ With the touch of your hand ♪ When the moon's sinking low ♪ Lord, please take me home ♪ I can't believe you're back. They're the best pancakes in the universe. I had to come back. I'm just teasing. I just figured, with all the attention you got from that video, you'd have a girlfriend by now. Even with that mullet. Video? It's all over social media, bro. You're viral. - ...this? - I'm live-streaming this. This is some misogynistic... The TV, too? I can't believe this. - That's me. - What the... Hilarious, right? Do it. What's your name? I'm Katie. Thorp. Do you want to hang out with us? Have a beer? That's nice. I have to find Sam. Bye, Thorp. We should've asked for his number. Shut up. He's too old. You see that tattoo, though? - Yeah. - And the creepy mustache? Aw, I miss you, too. Hmm. You want to help me find Sam today? Uh, I'd like to, I would, but I got a date with my girl, online. But maybe when I meet her for real, in person? She can introduce you to a friend. Hmm? We'll make it a double. Double what? You're a funny guy. I told you to knock three times. Oh. Did you bring me ice cream? Come on in. I'd call the police. But it's probably not a good idea, - since you're a Thorp. - Hmm. Maybe you should just hide. I can't hide. I have to find Sam. What else did you guys use to do? Her dad had a boat, so we would go to a secret island and bury treasure. You guys buried treasure? Yeah. Letters and toys. And... treasure. Do you think they're still buried out there? I don't know. Maybe she moved away. Have you tried to Google her? What's a "Google her?" "What's a 'Google her?'" Are you Sam? Have you seen Sam? Huh? Sam! I can't hear your heart. Yo, dude, your boat's floating away! I can't come in here anymore. This your way of telling me you don't like my pancakes? I love your pancakes. You cheating on me with another diner? I don't know any other diners. You going paleo? What's a "paleo?" What's up? Why are you not coming in no more? My friend, Olivia, she's eight. I buy her ice cream. - And I bought a boat. And I go bowling. - Hmm. But I'm out of money now. So, no more pancakes. How were you getting your money in the first place? From my parents' storage unit. Ah, one of those trust fund babies. Well, if you stay here, you're gonna need to get a job. I've never had a job. So, why don't you get one? Feel me? I do. You can't leave already. I can't find Sam. But you just got here. We need to go on a hunt. To find Sam. Someone's hunting me, though. I don't think it's real. It's probably just a joke. Hmm. Thorpy, Thorpy, open up the tunnel! Choo, choo! Sure I can help you... ...but you gotta help me, too. I like helping. I know this is gonna sound strange, but... would you mind coming back later tonight after everybody's gone? Okay. No, no. Don't, come back. I... I meant... I meant I can make your phone calls now... but I'd just like you to come back later tonight. - Do you like Chinese? - I do. Alaska, remind me to order takeout at 7:00 p.m. Take out set for 7:00 p.m. Oh, my son got her for me. She's really a big help, but she's not a hugger. Okay, let's make your calls. Thorp. Yeah... Yeah, just tell Peaches to come after Firefox. Uh, in about an hour or so. Hey, uh, let me call you back in a minute. All right. What's up, man? Can I help you? You can dance? Thanks for coming in. I'm Meg Bedonavich. Everyone calls me Meg Begs. You have a nice voice, Meg Begs. Hmm. You look like a movie star. Well, don't you just know the way to my heart? So, what's your name? Thorp. You're not gonna make any money with a name like that. What's your... Your stage name? Stage name? - I was bowling the other day... - Ugh, I love bowling. Me, too. I was with Tom Selleck. Oh, my God. I adore Tom Selleck. I would watch him bowl, I'd... I'd watch him read the phonebook. I'd watch him do anything. Love Tom Selleck. I love Tom Selleck, too. White Thunder. White Lightning. White Rhino. White Chupacabra. Um, White Unicorn. Do the White Thing. White's All Right. White Man Can Jump. Uh, White on White, White on Rice. Uh, Rice is White. Magnum PI. Oh, shit. Oh, I like that. I like that! - You're a private eye. - Yeah? You slay the audience with your, uh... - With your magnum moves. - Hmm. It's weird... but I kinda dig it. I dig it. You dig it? Yeah, goes with this little '80s thing you got going on. I see you like our founder's trust award. That's shiny. What's your handle? Oh, I'll tag you on Insta. Stand up. Come on, stand up. Take your jacket off. Your pants off. Come on, don't be shy. Where did you go to school? I left when I was eight. I never went to school. Huh. You know, they say honesty is the best policy, but that's not always the case... ...Mr... Thorp. Squat. Squat. Right there. I think we can work with this. Really? You'll give me cash fast? I won't, but other men will. Hmm. Let's see what you can do. ♪ Yeah ♪ Dance ♪ Dance for me ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ Well, dance ♪ Dance for me ♪ Yeah ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ Dance ♪ For me ♪ I'm so sorry your job search didn't turn out... People... People just don't realize how special you are. You think I'm special? Well, of course you're special. I just wish there was a way that you could make some money, but... Maybe selling something that you own, like, um, stocks, bonds. Uh... No. Okay. I know! We're gonna play a game. It's called "What Does Thorp Own?" I like games. How do we play? You tell me what you own. Shoes, Tom Selleck, house, - headband... - Wait, wait, wait. House? I can't sell my family's house. No, no, no. You don't have to sell it. Somebody comes in and lives with you in part of it. Sam's family used to live in our house. Exactly. Somebody comes in and they give you money every month. - Money every month? - Ah! Salud. Salut. Salud. Salut. - "D." - "D." Salud. A few years ago, my husband passed. He was a great guy. My soulmate. Wow! Could he dance. Whoa... I... I didn't know if I could ever be intimate with a man again. And for a while, I didn't... I didn't think about it. But it's hard, Thorp. When women age... they tell us... Society tells us... that we're not a sexual commodity anymore. Like I give two shits. But it doesn't mean I don't have sexual thoughts. It doesn't mean I don't have... desire for certain things. I'm 74. So what? And when I... When I hear that familiar song... you know, the kind where your hips start to sway. You can't help it. You gotta move your hips with a man. And it doesn't go away when your soulmate is gone. It's part of you... always. You know what I mean? I like talking to you. I like talking to you, too. Thanks. Alaska, play my favorite song. Playing favorite song. You wanna dance? Dance with me. I love dancing. Not like... Not like that. - This is nice. - Yeah. Real nice. - Tom Selleck. - What? I... I have to feed Tom Selleck. I... Thorp, wait! Wait, wait. I got something for you. It's not much, but it's enough... Oh, wait. It's enough to tide you over until you get someone to share the rent with you. Thank you, Pauline. I have a neighbor who also likes to dance. What? Bye, Thorp. Bye. Hi. You, uh, got a menu? You got a boyfriend? I'll take a coffee, black. Do I know you? From that video! Dude, you saved those girls' lives. Told you you were famous. Wow. Those, uh, pancakes any good? The sign says they're the best in the universe. Well, are they? I'm all ears, Thorp. All ears? Thorp. Oh, that's right. What a name. I'll take what he's having. Oh, you don't want that. He gets... You know what I want now, too? Triple order, coming up. You mind if I... So, do you come here a lot? Every day. But I spent all my $2 bills, so if I don't find someone to live in my place - and give me money every month... - Wait, wait. Your place is for rent? Just the bottom floor. It's... That's too wild. I... I'm looking for a place to rent. - You are? - Yeah. It's so wild. I just got into town. Wow. You ever meet anybody and you just feel connected? Like, we just knew each other from a different... A different time, a different universe. No. Yeah. I'm Rachel. I'm Thorp. Triple order. Holy cow. - Thanks. - You're welcome. ♪ There is a bamboo bungalow ♪ Deep in the jungle Don't you know? ♪ Where all the people Can let go ♪ To the sweet sound Of calypso ♪ She's here. Really? You'll give me money every month? I mean, it seems like a good deal. Can I see it? Oh. Come in. Wow. So why is it only $427 a month? That's exactly what I need for 30 days of money spending for me and Tom Selleck. He's my dog. I love it. Can I move in tomorrow? Really? Yea... Ow... Oh, you don't have to do that. Thank you. A gentleman too. Your mom must be proud. Is she? No, seriously, that's a real question. Oh, goodness! Thorp! Are... Oh, God. I'm okay. I'm okay. I messed up your box. Is she gonna be your girlfriend? I don't think so. But she's gonna live with you? If she likes it, she'll give me money every month. You're Thorp. Can't you just use your powers to make more money? I got all the important things. A baseball bat. - Do you play? - Baseball? - Yeah. - No. Sam and I used to play other games. Yeah? Like what? Like, uh, mud monster, tetherball and secret island. Oh, my God. Thorp, you have a secret island? Yeah. But it's a secret. I don't like her. You don't even know her. Neither do you. Now I can focus on finding Sam. I wish you were here to help me, too. Okay. Maybe I'll ask Rachel. Where have you looked? In the diner, bowling alley, people's houses, the secret island. Maybe she's not here anymore. Maybe she moved away. Or maybe she's dead. No. She's close. I can feel it. If she's still here, she's older now. Duh. She won't be bowling. What do women your age do? Can I come in? I heard you. - What? - Thin walls. - Huh. - I heard you come home. You must have been talking to this guy. Hi! What's his name again? Tom Selleck. Hi. Of course. How could I forget that name? Does Tom want a treat? Tom Selleck just had dinner. Well, believe it or not, I didn't come here to talk to Tom. I wanted to ask about the hot water. The water? Yeah. I'm having a hard time getting it to work. I really wanted to take a hot shower. You know, sometimes you come home and you're just dying for a steaming hot shower. Showers are nice. Hmm. So, can you help me? Um... Stay. Bye, Tom Selleck. You want some wine? You want some wine? Thorp? I, uh... I couldn't hear you, so just assumed the answer is yes. What is it? Um, Malbec? I don't... I don't know. Red. - Wow. - You like it? I've never had it. Shut up. Well, here's to a night of firsts. Is it working? Oh, my God. That is so hot. How did you do that? I hit it. Okay. Good to know. - This is how we do it. - Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah. I love this game. All right, your turn. Okay. Silly, that's not how it works. You have to choose truth or dare. Uh, truth! Okay. So why did you come back? I told you. I had to find Sam. No, I know, but... But... But what happened? So you were here and then you just, like, left? I had to. My parents made me. Well, where are your parents now? Come on, you can tell me. I'm your neighbor now. Remember? Where are your parents? It's not my turn. Can I do my dare now? Of course. To coming home. Olivia. Time for bed. Ew. Options for Thorp. Circle one. Leave. Die. Is this some kind of sick joke? This is my home. Maybe you should call the cops? No! Rachel already paid me. Okay, okay, okay. Look, look. Take a deep breath. I can't leave. I'm calling the police! No, no, no! Stop, stop! - Okay. It's gone. It's gone. - Stop. Stop, please. It's gone. It's gone. It's gone. Thorp, now, you're my boy, right? I am your boy. I don't wanna have to kick you out in front of all the other customers. Sorry. Look. Look at me, Thorp. Thorp, look at me. Now... Now, what's the one thing in the world that makes you happiest? - Pancakes and bowling. - Oh. - And pancakes. - Yeah. I got you covered on the pancakes. How about I take you bowling? Really? I... I need to find Sam. That can wait. That can wait. Let me take you out. Boys' night. - Boys' night? - Yeah! - All right. - Boys' night. Okay, Thorp. Sa... Just save some for the ladies. I missed you so much these past few days. I was afraid that kiss might have scared you off. Kiss? Or that aliens had kidnapped you and I should have called the cops. No, he's been busy hanging out with me. I'd like another date. If you're up for it. Sounds nice. But this is boys' night. You know, some other time. It is different. When I was a kid, it was better. We were more connected then. What you smoking? People are more connected now than ever. How? Really? Okay. Let's say my mom calls me up. Wants me to make dinner. I call us delivery using an app. Boom. Or, if it's a hot summer day and I'm at work, I got another app that controls my AC at home. Boom. By the time I get there, got it feeling like Toronto. I even met my girl using an app. I mean, I still got to meet her in real life, but this is the point. I can control everything with this smartphone, which, if you think about it, makes for a smarter life. If you think about. It's not real. You... This is a group text from my boys from high school. If it weren't for this, I'd never talk to these guys. Also, I could record live video and stream it automatically to my friends and family at home. I can even call my girl and see her when we talk to each other. Yeah, she's cute, right? I'm not gonna demonstrate right now 'cause I'll never get off the phone, but... How's that being less connected? But you haven't even met her in real life. You just said that. See? It's... It's not real. Thorp, wait. Wait up, Thorp. Thorp, wait up. What are you doing? Come here. See? Someone's gonna call the cops. They do this every night. You do this every night? Yes. I'm out of here. You don't believe me. Believe what? What the hell are you talking about? Look. Come on, they'll see us! Little baby. Forget it. I'm out of here. Thorp, stop! Oh, my God. Holy shit! - Mama. - Do something! You have a little baby. - What do you want? - You have a baby. Get the fuck out of my house, man! You have a ba... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop. There's... There's no need for violence. Call the cops! You... What's wrong with you? Seriously, I wanna know. Nothing up there can help you. Yes, I know you're going through a lot trying to find Sam, and this whole death threat thing. But if you're not gonna talk to me, you need to talk to someone. A professional or something. I like you, Thorp. I do. But if you're gonna be doing this, we can't be friends. I can't help you. I'm sorry. Olivia? What do you want? To talk to you. Go away. Olivia. And where were you when I needed you the last three nights? The girls at my school are making fun of me for not having any friends. I told them I have a best friend. You. You know, we have ice cream together every night. But they said you don't exist. And I really needed to talk to you. But you left me. Just like you left Sam. "For Thorp's eyes only." "I know where you eat pancakes." "I know where you bowl." "I know where you swim." "This is your last day on Earth." Rachel. Rachel. Thorp? What are you doing? I wanna go home. Wait, but isn't this your home? Didn't you grow up here? Yeah, but... You miss your family? Where'd they go? Far away. But where, exactly? Up there. Yeah. I miss my mom and dad. Where's your mom and dad? They are up there, too. I know what it's like to be alone. Hey. I have an idea. Wow! Nice boat. I had another one, but I lost it. Oh. What's up with your tattoo? This? It's my mark. It gets bigger every year. That's wild. Yeah. You ever jumped? With Sam? No, it's too high. I wasn't big enough. But you're big enough now. I should be looking for Sam, not having fun out here with you. Why is Sam so special to you? She's why I came back. Let's play a game. I like games. Pretend that I'm Sam. Tell me what you want to tell me. Hi, Sam. I'm sorry I... Hi, Sam. I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye. I wish I could go back to when we were young again, when everything was easy. I miss you. And I love you. It's me, Thorp. Let's play another game. Okay. If you jump off that rock, I'll tell you a secret. So what's the secret? Wow. That was a good secret. Yeah. Now I want to take you to my special place. All right, all right. All right, all right. Now, if your neighbor's snoring, now's the time to give him a gentle nudge. This is important for them, too. James 5:16 goes on to say, "Therefore... "confess your sins to each other "and pray for each other so that you may be healed." You get that? Confess your sins to each other so that you may be healed. Now, while this was originally intended as a confession for the sick, I want to empower you all right now to confess to your neighbors here. Ah. For the new faces here, hey, uh, I'm Frannie. - Hey, Frannie. - Hi, Frannie. Y'all are family. You also know that I'm a loud and proud transgender woman, and I gotta confess. There's a woman down the street from me, who just got a new Ferrari, convertible. Every time I drive past it, I... I feel so jealous. Sometimes I, uh... find my daughter's toenails, and I... Well, I eat them. You know, it's... It's shiny. It's just... too shiny. I miss farting in public. I got IBS, bad. I just want to pull over and punch in the windows and... piss on the hood. I can't help it. It's... She's so cute. Defile it, you know? Oh, screw that. Today I'm gonna let it go! But I don't. I just keep on driving. Seeking salvation one day at a time. - Keep driving, B. Keep driving. - Thanks. I guess I haven't really been here in a while. Uh, my name is Rachel. - Hi, Rachel. - Hi. Um... So, today is the anniversary of my parents' death. Yeah. And for as long as I can remember I've been searching for the... The why. Why did it... Why did it happen to them? Why did it happen to me? Why... Why did it have to happen at all? And, um... every year when today approaches... I'm just... I'm reminded of this insufferable pain. A pain that really ruined my life, and a pain that... makes me want to hurt others in the way that it's hurt me. Or, at least, I don't know, I had felt that way until now. I found a little bit of solace with myself... and with my neighbors. And with a new friend. You see that there? That is the truth in the booth. Thank you, Rachel. Anyone else? All right. I want to thank you all for sharing today. You... all of you. You make me want to be a better human being. Well, thanks for coming tonight. I, um... I thought you might get up there and speak. You know, confess something. I didn't. I know. Is there anything that you want to confess right now? Just tell me. I'm too scared. Just tell me. You make me feel things. Oh, God. What? No! I'm not ready for you yet. Back to sleep. We're gonna play another game, Thorpy-poo. I like games, Rachel-poo. You can start by calling me Sam. Why would I do that? Because that's my real name. Sam. Like Sam Sam? Like my best friend? - Stop talking. - You mean I found you? Quiet! I thought we were friends. Friends? No. Friends don't ruin each other's lives. - I didn't ruin your life. - Your family. Your family ruined my life. I'm sorry? Oh, my God. Every day... you go bowling, you eat pancakes. I do love pancakes. - You're a fucking kid. A child. - Uh, what? I never got to be one. Well, that's crazy. Everyone's a child at some point. No... I had to be the adult. I had to reassure my parents that they were going to be fine, that they weren't gonna be opened and closed, like a lab rat while they slept. It sounds crazy, doesn't it? What are you doing, Thorp? Want to play Doctor? Right now? Still no heartbeat. Your family played Doctor in their own way, too. Why? What were they looking for? Were there other families besides mine? I don't know. And then that last night... you showed me the truth. I... I can't hear your heart. Thorp, what is that? Mom? Dad? Mom? Dad? Daddy... Daddy, please wake up! After that, my parents battled depression, drugs, insomnia. We were trying to put the past behind us. But my mother was haunted by what happened. Couldn't sleep. Couldn't work. Nobody believed her, though. And in the end, that's what did it. Nobody believed her. My father said he wouldn't be selfish... that he'd look after me. But he couldn't take the shame. And on the anniversary of my mother's death... I'm sorry. Where are your parents? They won't come back. There's nothing on Earth worth their time. They told me not to come and find you. You got to say goodbye to your family. I never did. We were so small when it happened. I never wanted to hurt you. Somehow... Unbelievably, I had fun again. Like when we were kids. When I loved you. What am I supposed to do now? Killing me won't help you. No. But it might make me feel better. I'm your best friend. I love you. Mom? Samantha? Oh, my gosh. It really is you. I love you so much. Please don't forget that. I love you, too, Mom. I have to go now. Goodbye, Sammy-poo. Bye, Mom. Dad. Sweetie? Oh, my God. You turned out so beautiful. You're so beautiful. I hope you find peace someday. I love you, Dad. I love you, Sammy. Goodbye. Shit! Junior? Are you Pauline? Olivia. Okay. Guess I'll have to eat all this ice cream by myself. Daddy! Goodbye, Thorp.
