- Come and look. - We can see fine from here. Darling, this landscape will be ours... ...until the day we die. Before the war of 1939, it was still cultivated. The soil is good. It'll be ready to work it. What a pity the trees aren't more in flower. We'll plant tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers. Mum, the view at the back is superb. Good day ladies and gentlemen. So, did we leave the capital? I'm from Bois-Colombes. My name's Fouchard. We're neighbours. I won't hide the panorama from you. I'll put up a nice fence. Dad, it's 6pm... We have to wake him up. Yes, I heard. Mathias, you need to get up. Hi, Dad. I slept well. - How are you? - OK. You get up later and later. I'm getting old. Clovis was on the phone, he has some spinach to ship. I'll go see him. Is Mum okay? Yes she is fine. So... Have a good evening. Sure. Good evening. I'm not here. Felicien's sick. He has the bad flu. I think he's going to die. He wants to hear you sing something. How much will you give me? A bit more than last time. Come on, make an effort. Felicien is my cousin. Every time you sing, he gets better. I want double. If the price of spinach drops again, what can I do? Don't bring them back. We've been eating it for a week. Sit up, kids... Come on! - Like a drink? - No, I don't have time. Come on, a quick one. I have to go to Geoffroy's. Six, seven, eight, nine... ten, eleven... I want to go. I want to become a cook in the city. Get out of there, I tell you. Come on, get off. I want to work in a restaurant. That's enough... If your father found out... ...he could shoot me. - Take me there. - Go home! I'll talk to your father. I wanted to go to the city. Work in a restaurant. In the morning, I take herbal tea or leftover soup. That's what we did before tea, coffee, chocolate. It's certainly healthier. I've found authentic olive oil. First cold pressed. I know the best in the region. 50 km away. They make it for me. And on my instructions. I'll take you. Next Sunday, you're my guests. We'll be here. You again! Poison-peddler! Go away! I'll show you books... ...which explain that antibiotics are bad for livestock. Never buy anything from this individual. You're very kind, Madam. If I see you again, I'll slash your tires! Was it you, last week...? No, but they did well. Hello. - You know me? - Er... yes. I'm a nurse, I live on that hill. Remember? You asked me to deliver wood and you weren't there. What are you doing, next Sunday? I'm inviting everyone in the valley to come for lunch. Everyone? There's a lot of them. 64. They'll all be there. It'll be great, won't it? I'm counting on you and on your parents. See you on Sunday. And we'll eat well. I love to eat. Hey, Fernand, you okay? I'm ruined. I just have to sell my farm. - Do you know Malitorne? - No. He's my brother-in-law. He conned me. His business was going badly. I lent him some money... He was to pay me back, 6 months ago. He can't pay me... and he buys a new car. The bastard. He needs the shit kicked out of him. He's my brother-in-law. Credit cards, mortgage... We're going to beat the shit out of him. I don't know how to punch someone. In a boules competition, I wanted to fight... I woke up in hospital. The injustice disgusts me. If you want, I'll do it. You'd do this for me? I'm Fernand's best friend. I don't understand! So... We treat ourselves to a new car, do we? I don't know how to drive. What? Is this the 4th left, here? No. This is 3rd left. Oh sorry. I thought you were Mr Malitorne, the hardware merchant. I'm with Post and Telegraph. Can I do something for you? Nothing. I'd like to make amends. Can I fix you? Just leave me alone... Leave me alone. Get out, Sir. Mr Malitorne? He's not here. He's gone out. When will he be back? I bashed some poor guy for nothing. Hello, crook-back. Are you doing well? Don't forget you feel the cold. Watch out for morning frosts. Hello there, almond tree. Junior, you're happy... it's autumn. Luckily I'm here. You've grown up. Hello, Zoe. You got up early today. It's barely 3 pm. I have stuff to do. Anyone home? Hello! Why didn't you go inside? I always leave my door unlocked. I brought you some melons for Sunday. - The last ones of the season. - Thanks. These are my father's melons. I'm not a farmer anymore. He has time... he's retired. I wanted to ask you... On Sundays my brother comes up from town, with his wife. Invite them... I want there to be a lot of us. When I feel anxious, I eat. What are you anxious about? It happens. There are days. It's good... I make it myself. No thanks. Why are you inviting the whole village? To get to know each other... To show we want to get along. It'll cost you a lot. I put some money aside, just for this. Come in for a drink. Oh no. Another time. How do we get up there? On foot. A car won't make it. It seems a couple lives in the farmhouse at the top. They don't want to see anyone. We haven't seen them for 6 months. I want to invite them. It'll be hard to find the right path. Can you come with me tomorrow? My parents are not my parents. I came from State Custody. A man who hasn't married is rare, in the countryside. I almost got married 15 years ago. It didn't happen. So much the better, eh. By now I'd be bored with my wife and children. Instead of that, I'm relaxed. I decided once and for all when I was 17... ...that I'd stay single all my life. I'll tell you one thing... I can't stand anyone. When I arrived in this part of the world.... ...an extraordinary thing happened. For the first time in my life, I felt at home. One day I'll be buried in the cemetery down there. Until then, I'll live like a peasant. As humble as possible. Will I look like a real peasant girl? Well... Honey, come and have some tea. No time... I have to return the field. I know all these paths. I'm the one who marked them all. It's been a few years. I published a booklet on walks in the region. - Really? - I was crazy. Do you have a copy left? Hundreds. They returned the unsold ones to me. Come on, sheep... out! Come on. Come on, come on. I'm exhausted. You'll help me make the bread, later. I lit the oven. We'll eat what's left from last week. Tomorrow we have to kill the pig. What time is it? There are people on the way up. - They may just be walkers. - No, they're coming this way. I know them! Oh... Miss Morand. Hello. - Let me introduce you to Mathias. - Hello. Neighbours in Paris, in the 15th district. Mr and Mrs Girardin ran a bookstore. I'm living down there. Life in the great outdoors is succeeding for you. But we're pretty tired... We gave birth to a calf last night. Here, we live to the rhythm of the sun. Everything you'll eat comes from our farm. Even the wine. It’s not great, but you don’t become a wine-grower overnight. My first harvest. Have you seen the landscape? It's so beautiful! I can't get enough of it. Sometimes it looks like a Corot, other times, a Cezanne. We're surprised that the peasants never buy paintings. No, Sir, not at my house. Get into the habit of living healthily. Hey, wait. Shall I offer you a last drink? There's alcohol in my house and you can smoke. It was a teacher from Draguignan who owned this house. He came in the summer, during the holidays. I saw you fight: It was at the supermarket. Yes. They gave me rotten frozen food... ...so I asked to speak to the manager. He was a bit fragile... I broke his arm. Did you know the lady who lived here before the teacher? Yes. She offered us snacks, when I was a kid. She lived alone with dogs, cats, birds. It was said that she was very rich. In the end, she fell in love with the priest. At the time, there was a parish priest. Only, he was chaste... He didn't want her. So she hanged herself in the sacristy. That's sad. Yeah. When there's one who loves and the other doesn't... It can be nasty. That's why it's better not to love anyone. That's my opinion, too. I'm warning you... I'll only sleep with you once. Afterwards, it creates links. You're absolutely right. You wouldn't mind... ...if I took a bath first? No, go ahead. I always wash before going to bed. You like to live alone, and me too. That's good. What I said is not true. I can have sex more than once. Even several, even often. Only, I take precautions, you never know. Things need to be clear between us. I hate public outbursts. We meet if we want to... and then bye-bye. Tremendous. What I like about you, is you’re not sentimental. It makes it too complicated. Hello? Yes? Yes. Alright. I'll come right away. Felicien needs an injection. I'm going. Stay there, if you want. I'd prefer... ...that we stayed with “vous”. - It makes me feel uncomfortable. - I'll try. We're talking about the implementation of an oil refinery here. I hope not. You're wrong... It'd give work for a lot of people. It seems that Jean-Marc has returned from Paris. Who's Jean-Marc? A local boy. He was my first fiance. He left when he was 20, for a job. He become an oyster seller. He sold them to a good clientele. Anyway, he has enough money to retire at his age. How old is he? 45. We had our first communion together. He's February 28, I'm February 12. He told me he was coming back to get married. Good! He wants to marry a girl from the region. We're all married, unfortunately. When you have money, you always find someone. If he proposes to me, I'll say yes. - And your husband? - I'll leave him. I've wanted to leave him, for 10 years... I'll do it! Hey, look... there’s Jean-Marc. Hi, Jean-Marc. Hello ladies. It seems that tomorrow, there's a party in the country. A nurse is inviting us all to her place. I hope you're going to behave yourself. Isabel, my dove! Come on, everyone up! I need to sleep. No! We need to finish the roof before the first rains. Get dressed. And your mother too. Come on. I'll fix the baby's bottle, and I'll join you on the roof. Something bit me... scorpions. - Scorpions aren't dangerous. - I don't like them. - Get the shovel and two buckets. - Go to buggery! You and the children, go to Louise's. I'll suffer, and stay here. You go ahead... I'll look after the shop. I didn't pay for a great hair-do for you to stay here. I can stay. You get too muddled. You don't know how to chat with customers. - And me? - Out of the question. For once we're invited! Do not make that face... otherwise, I won't go. Go on... go! What if we closed the shop... ...for this one time. Really? You want us to close? Since we can't do otherwise. I'll take at noon those who have no car. Mathias. Put your dog away. Someone will pinch him. Pinch him? Every Sunday, dogs disappear. They're taken to the city to be sold to hospitals. That pays for the restaurant. I didn't know that. Lutin...! The food isn't great, but there is a beautiful view. I'm Mrs Courtieux. I know you. Your son-in-law bought the explorer's house. An explorer was in our house? He went to Mexico at the end of the last century. But the sun there made him crazy. Since then, everyone who bought his house has gone crazy. That's interesting. Your daughter and her husband aren't coming to Louise's? Yes, but I preferred to leave them, to come alone. That way they can argue easier. Yes, that's what happened. These are the benches from the old school. You can keep them... They're no longer of any use. There'll still be 45 of us. I'm disappointed that some said no. The people are unsociable here. They're not used to being invited by someone they don't know. - How are you? - Good. And you? My brother Roger, who lives in Toulon. His wife, Janine. I broke my arm while water-skiing. Come and see what you're going to eat. I made bread like you've never seen before. The sun! You know my father and my mother. I'm wearing my dentures. She put them on to look pretty. You have this part, which is the kidney chop... ...both shoulders and...? - The neck? - Yes, the neck. - Hello, Laura. - Hello, Mathias. What time is it ? I came... I looked at the sky... the most beautiful in the world... Purity! And I stayed. We're involved in a book on small French villages... ...for a New York publisher. We chose this one as being very representative. The great thing about this region... ...is that we meet people every day who are exactly like us... ...in our learning about peasant life. I was born to be a peasant... I just realised it. We left Normandy so my husband can write. He always wanted to be an author. In Rouen, he'd started three detective novels. Here, in its solitude, he'll finally be able to create. Yes. I'll get to it soon. Thanks. An extraordinary life. You'll live to be very, very old... ...with lots of love. My husband, the best butcher of the region. Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen... I wanted to tell you that tonight I will be dead. Fernand, you're going to ruin our day. I'm going to kill myself today. I'm going to kill myself. You don't believe me, do you? And this? Silence! So. I know, I'm making a spectacle of myself... ...but when a man is unhappy, he must share it with others. I wanted you to know that. Now let's have some fun. Now that Fernand has said what he wanted to... I want to do the same. Zoe, I love you. I love you, Zoe. I've always loved you. I never dared tell you. I've loved you since the very day that you came here. I love you because we slept together once, for fun. I love you, Zoe. I'm asking you to marry me, in front of everybody. Moise, you're crazy. So, is it yes or no? I can't do without you any longer. You shouldn't drink. It goes to your head. Sit down. We'll talk. That's it. I get it. I fucked up. What time is it ? Shut up! You're all happy to find yourselves in this country. Well, I'm not. I have a proposition to make to you all. If any of you wants to buy my bakery... I'll give it to him. It's not profitable. I have to do masonry by day, and make bread at night. If we no longer have a baker, where do we buy our bread? I don't know. You'll manage. - Wait. - Thanks. It's for my little dog. To change your mind, I'll tell you... ...how I killed two Germans in 1944. We all know your story. But for me, it makes me happy to tell it. It was a Wednesday evening, in the month of June. I raise my glass... I raise my glass to the one who welcomes us into her home. Wishing her that she finds a good husband... ...and that she makes us some beautiful children. Bottoms up! We set the beat... One, two, three... I've had three men in my life. Two morons... ...and one idiot. I don't know... I never knew how to choose men. They choose me. If you have someone in mind, tell me. I'm good judge. - I've nobody. - So much the better. Anyway, with me, I closed the book. Finished. No! Men are too fragile. We spend our time mending them, when they don't drop dead. Has this happened to you? Yes one time. I was making love with a guy. Bingo! He's dead. Smiling, mind you. But it's a weird feeling. Tell me. Fernand has disappeared. Excuse me, eh. Look at that house. There, there've been births, deaths, marriages... ...parents hopeful for their children. The girls leaving to live their lives. The boys staying. They got engaged and it all started again. One day... ...after many of deprivation, of misery... ...and sleepless nights... Because before deciding that, we think about it for years. the man who lived here said... ''Tomorrow we shall leave.'' His name was Papricas. He was a beekeeper. He left. He never came back. I could leave too. Sell what I have left to anyone. My brother-in-law? I don't blame him. It was explained. He has more worries than me. But I was born here. And I want to die here. In the last 5 years, 12 have left the district. I counted them. They were sick of growing vegetables just to throw away. I don't want to be the 13th. It brings bad luck. So, I prefer to kill myself. Give me your gun. I have another one at home... well hidden. What are they doing? Picking mushrooms. It's forbidden here. They don't have the right. We'll scare them. You didn't see the sign. They are everywhere. ''Communal land, mushrooming forbidden.'' You'll sell our mushrooms to the canneries. Come on, leave your baskets. Leave the basket. Leave it. Bastards! Stop pushing me... My head is pounding. Once, I made love with a girl who had two legs in plaster. - It was sublime. - You're a one! Does your husband fuck well? If one day that tells you, ...you can have whatever you want, no strings attached... ...I can be reached here, care of the post office. We need to go home before the traffic jams. Let's stay a little longer. It's so nice in the fresh air. The doctor told you that city air is bad for you. Think about your health. Come on. Go back and play bowls. I want to, but we'll be stuck in traffic. There's no more wine! I'll get some from home. I'll bring 3 demijohns. You can't drive in the state you are in. We're going to go to my house... that way, we'll bring back a barrel. A barrel...! My car is faster. It has no brakes. Are you in? You can go. All the same, a woman gets married. But not me. Are you considering life without a man? Not necessarily. But without a husband. And children? One day you'll regret not having any. Those who want to, do it. But I don't want to. isn't it time you left her alone? If a lady wants to live free, she has the right. Besides, I think she's right. Alright. Well, I'll leave you with a single woman. Don't go! I'll never forget you. - Where are my glasses? - You've got them. Your mother tires me! The way you are, I'd rather walk home. I want to live. Let me go. No, let me go. I'm walking home. Come on, no fuss. I don't want to see you anymore. I love life too much to want to die. I want to live to see how long it will be before I die. Good night. Hi. You see, I retrained myself. In summer, I sell products from Provence to Brittany... ...and then the opposite. He and I raised goats. They're all dead. We're leaving, yes. Yes yes. Open the door! If you don't open, I'll set fire to the ground floor. What do you want? To look at you... How beautiful you are in the light. You see, it's not true, I don't have any petrol... The garage is closed. No, Zoe, don't close it. I'd like to sleep with you again. Just once. Just for a bit. And then we'd get married. Listen, Moise... You're a good guy... But I know about marriage. I've already been married. It took me 20 years to become a widow. Neither with you nor anyone else, would I start again. One question and I'll leave you, because I'm sleepy. Why did you sleep with me, 5 years ago on New Year's Eve? You really want to know? Yes. Because you looked like a sailor who I met when I was 14. He arranged to meet me in La Ciotat, I missed the train... ...and when I arrived, he was gone. A sailor. A sailor. Hey, it's me! Come quickly to bed. He left. He was just coming to get a suitcase of clothes. I didn't dare tell you the last time... ...but I sleep badly with the window closed. At my place, it's always open. Can I open it? I'd rather not. I'll catch a cold. - You'd see, we'd sleep better. - I've already tried. Get into bed. Alright... But I won't sleep well. Only... I like to sleep. I sleep 12 hours a night. I am the man who sleeps the most. And I sleep well because my window is open. What if we opened it just a little? No, I don't want to be sick. So I'm the bad guy. It's crazy, we're lost. On the top of the hill, you had to turn left. 3 weeks without a guide, this is madness. Last year in the Cevennes, for the same price.. ...we had a guide... and breakfast included. Here's a local... He'll let us know. But he's dead. O N E Y E A R L A T E R I've been here for four days and I haven't seen anyone. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. I was on holiday in Yugoslavia. Hey, I was thinking... The little cabin that you lived in up there... Would you sell it to me? It'll make you some money. Money? To do what with? I have my pay, my war pension... Please, I'll give it to you. - And that won’t deprive you? - No. I was young and happy there. I'll never go back there. It'd hurt me too much. We'll go see the solicitor, and the place will be yours. Parisians welcome. Regular or super? I'd like to sell my truck. Know anyone who might be interested? It's old and decrepit. It's not worth much. But maybe I can find a buyer. GOAT CHEESE - So, what does Manon say? - A cup of tea. Me and tea... I'm on my own all day. My daughter helps a friend who runs a second-hand store. The baby is in a nursery. And my son-in-law travels around trying to sell his cheeses. Do you sell a lot of them? No. Yesterday I sold three. Give it up. We're going to pick olives. Geoffroy sold his land to a developer. He's inviting all his friends to participate in his last harvest. He's a sentimentalist. And at least we'll have free olives for the winter. My son-in-law makes out that I'm a useless mouth. But, I eat like a bird. I'm happy. I think it will be a beautiful truffle harvest this year. I brought you some. After Fernand's death, my brother reimbursed me. Things are better now. I paid all our debts. When I feel blue, I buy shoes. It cheers me up. I've bought four pairs, lately. You bought yourself a car. This type costs a lot to run. Exactly. That way, I'll drive less. I don't know how it happened... ...but I love you more. I even wonder how I liked you at all. And the more I look at you, the less I understand. So don't look at me anymore. I'd prefer it. I can tell you that I love you more. Take your basket and shut up. Charlotte and I have been engaged since the night before last. We'll get married as soon as she gets a divorce. I couldn't get here sooner. I work at the hospital in the mornings. How's your detective novel going? I can't wait to read it. Will you give me a copy? I made a big decision... I shan't be a writer. In this part of the world, I discovered laziness. A difficult art that requires more will than you'd think. We keep the house... ...but the rest will become a camping club. On the left... ...they'll build bungalows. Mind you, very attractive ones... because it will be a fancy place. I agreed to sell only on that condition. Here, there'll be the swimming pool. It'll be superb. He's just emotional. He'll get over it. It's not emotion, it's red wine.,,, I drank too much. - Shall we spend the evening together? - If you want to. My heart still has 20 years in it... ...but they're no good to my wife. "I feel when I see you..." "...that a tremor is shaking me." "And me, Manon, when I see you..." "It's amazing how I'm throbbing" "I love you better than my turkeys" "I love you better than my sheep..." "When they make their sweet gurgle" "When each of them goes "baaa"... - We'll spend it all this evening. - You're crazy. I've never taken you to a restaurant. We haven't lived the high life. It's about time we changed our habits. But where does this money come from? From my truck. Tomorrow I'll have even more. A lot of money. Don't ask me anything. Let's also get used to mystery. Not here, it's not expensive enough. - How about there? - Yes. I think we're in luck. This'll be the turning point. Louise, I sold my house. My parents keep theirs. Now I have nothing. Just a small cabin in the mountains. Something's finally happening in my life. But for what? Who knows? It's cooked with thyme, rosemary, all herbs of the region. Of course. Hey... It wasn't enough for you to sell enough to poison the planet? Now, you're exploiting tourists? - Let's eat somewhere else. - You've already ordered. We haven't ordered anything. Don't eat here! It's all rotten, disgusting. If you knew what happens in the kitchen! Where did you learn to dance like that? I was taught. She was a dancer at the Bandol casino. It was a long time ago. I even forget the sound of her voice. Only the rumba remains with me. Is your house still yours this evening? Yes. I'm moving tomorrow. I'd like to see it. Take me. There's nothing to see. But the rest of the house? I haven't been going there for a long time. You don't eat with your parents? Oh no, never. We don't eat at the same times. And behind this door? That's why you wanted to come? You wanted to know if what is said is true. Don't say it, if it bothers you. No, it doesn't bother me. Not anymore. On the contrary. Would you believe, I closed this door 15 years ago... ...and I never reopened it. Go ahead, open it. So... There is a dining room and a bedroom. I bought this stuff to get married. What if we burned all this furniture? Hey, Sir... Sir! Sir. You know me? I assaulted you at home. I mean you no harm. I'd like to give you a nice present. I don't want any gifts. Leave me alone . Hello, Mathias. Something wrong ? No. I rented a bus for Friday and for three days. I take those who want to spend the weekend by the sea. I'm the one who pays. I got a small inheritance. Well, I'll ask my husband. What tires me here is the clean air. Francois and I spent years in smoky boxes. So much clean air all at once, wears me out. I close the windows, because there's too much oxygen. What if we were ambassadors? No, too boring. I decided to repair this house myself. I can't afford masons. We'll give you advice. The day I succeeded in mixing my first mortar... ...I was so happy! Mathias! We have to say no. Sorry, we won't participate in your little trip. With the livestock, the barnyard, we can't be absent. You know very well that farmers don't get holidays. On the other hand, WE will come. What is this thing about a bus? How did you come up with the idea? Last year, you invited us all. This year, you don't have the means. So... What? It's very high. Hello Mum. - Here, sit down. - Thanks. It's high and it's not big. It'll be enough for me. My poor boy... You should've moved to town while there was time. You'd have got an office job, like your brother. Mum, I simply will never leave here. Anyway, we get to have a beautiful walk. My legs have been better for a while, now. And Dad's too. So we take opportunities to walk. About your trip to the coast... We wanted to come, but... Hey, I'm counting on you. You know... At our age, even small trips... It's a lot of hassle. I don't know what to wear. I don't have the right clothes. I'll buy you some. No. We won't be coming. Hey! I've come to get you. I'm always early. I'm the opposite. I know. One thing would be funny, as we are not going to live together... Why don't we try it for a bit? Not for long... During the trip, just to see. - Have you lived with anyone? - Yeah. Answer me honestly... Are you jealous? If tomorrow you learn that I'm sleeping with someone else... I'll conclude that it is over... but no complaints. I wouldn't be able to stop myself from blaming you. I don't like it, but I can't help being jealous. Want to know why I didn't get married? No. I'll tell you anyway. If I got married, I'd be jealous all my life. It'd be bad for me and bad for my wife... So why? Better to live in peace. Are you interested in my proposal? We try to live together for two or three days? We're leaving you to give you the feeling of responsibility. - Have you forgotten anything? - No, I haven't forgotten anything. I hate carrying suitcases on trips. It spoils everything for me. - What about your husband? - He's working. Bye. I hope you'll be here when I get back. Where are you going ? I'm going to the Riviera, with the whole village. Is Zoe going too? We'll see. Go get her for her to sing something. I do not feel good. I'll tell her to come see you on Monday. Not Monday... Right away. What if I died during her absence? Some need to go away for a cure. All I need, are those songs. As I explained to each of you... A nice pot of money dropped in my lap... ...so don't worry about the cost of the trip. I prefer to spend my money with you. For us, it won't be a holiday. We're going to look for accommodation. See what we can get from our land. We want to buy an apartment for our retirement. Facing the sea. And I'll become a locksmith. We'll have to wait a bit. Zoe's singing for my cousin. My little dog died... Run over last night by a car. I forgot to tie him up. We buried him. He was completely flat. In tiny pieces. Calm down. Come on. He fell asleep. In the next elections, we'll have to take over the town hall. Now I'm alone in life. I only have you. My daughter and my son-in-law... That won't last long. My daughter can't get used to living here. She talks about going to live on an island in the Indian Ocean. Finally... I would like to know why you agreed to come. Because you have your things to do. I suggest you drop everything and you accept. What for? Well, I'm going to the city to find a wife. - You've been looking for years! - I'm hard to please. But they're harder to please than I am. The inconvenience of a village is... ...that you've known the girls since kindergarten. So, obviously, you don't want to marry them. Why are you here? For some time now, I haven't wanted anything. In the evening, I don't even want to get undressed. Here we are at home. Tonight, we'll leave the window shut. There's too much noise outside. I am used to the noises of the city. The window can be open. You'll sleep on the right side, and me on the left. Tell me what annoys you about me. Nothing. No, not ''nothing''. We've known each other for a year, we know our faults. Go ahead, I'm listening. I can certainly list your faults. Go ahead. 1. You only think about yourself. 2. You're a loner. 3. You don't need anyone. I am wrong? No. And your health... These herbal teas that I drink to please you! You're disorganised... you eat at all hours. I eat when I'm hungry. You, yes, but other people... And your bad faith... We agree on something, you forget it. Afterwards, you pretend... who knows what. That's enough! My turn. First of all... ...you should fight. A peasant fights. I didn't wait for you, to fight. You shouldn't have left the riot squad to me. Three times, they put me in prison. Don't worry, you have all the man-faults. Plus this way of greeting me! We've been sleeping together for a year, and you still call me "vous". It's discretion. You have a very bad temper. - I'm bad tempered? - Yes. That takes the cake! Shouldn't it be heated? No way. In bathers like everyone else. Mathias bought you costumes. Act like men. Come on, Moise. It's cold, but we're swimming anyway. Come on. Ready... set... Go! Come on, faster. Come on, Peggy! It's funny... I never saw Fernand in a swimsuit. He wanted to take me to Ireland and Wales... ...for the Five Nations tournament. We'll never go. I'm the one driving the bus. Yes I know. I'm still tanned, because I have a solarium. I noticed. So, are you coming in? No. I'm going to read. Above all, don't wake me up. Spread your arms wide. Don't be afraid. Spread your arms wide. No, no, spread them. Tomorrow we will visit the museums. We're not here to spend all day in the water. Plus, we're dying of cold. That night I went out. Whores. Nothing but whores. So what? You didn't expect to find honest women working the street? Well, you never know. He's preparing an album about old French habits. Do I have old habits? Louise, push yourself a little. Ah, there you go. That's good ! It was our house. We lived on the first floor. My father was a tram driver. Every morning, I came to buy bread. I left my parents to become trapeze artist in a circus. - Trapeze artist? - Yes. So what? It lasted 5 years. I was in love with the animal-trainer. So long ago. I end up wondering if it happened at all. It made me so happy, but I've no regrets. Let's get out of here. The bus driver's after me. What do you suggest? He's married, and about to divorce. You have to say no to men, until you've thought about it. I know how to say no. But when I say no, they leave. Hey.... don't I know you? No, I do not think so. Well, try to remember... Us two... I was just back from military service. We saw each other on the beach. You must be mistaken. Really...! The two of us... Once near the station, in a room. Certainly not. A room with a four-poster bed that moved. I remember. There was wallpaper with yellow flowers... ...and the window curtains with the same flowers. What did you become? I run a shoe store... and I'm a grandfather. If you don't hire this kid, I'll wreck the place. I've had enough! You are the twelfth this morning. I even offered you money to hire him... ...and you tell me to look elsewhere. The kid will show you what he can do. He's talented. Cooking is his passion. I never would have believed it would be so expensive. With what we have, we won't find anything under 50 km inland. It's not worth leaving the country to come here. I'm wearing my nice tie. Zip me up. I haven't worn this dress in 2 years. I need to party from time to time. We send the kids to bed and we go on an adventure. When the programs are finished, you take him to bed. I saw this in a movie. Coming down a staircase in a dress, a bottle of champagne in hand. I booked in the best restaurant in town... So let's go! The crayfish were very good. I wanted to take more, but I didn't dare. Where are we going ? To Flamenco. It's not far from here. It's wonderful to walk barefoot in puddles. Come on, ladies, do like me. Go on, do as she says. Closed for the holidays Let's take a walk by the sea, it's nice out. There's a nightclub over there. If it's to see breasts, I'm going back to bed. So let's go somewhere else. If we found a terrace with a gypsy orchestra... You wouldn't know a place where we can have some fun? Sounds like music over there. Let's go see. It's probably an underground club. This is reckless. No, it's exciting. Come on. Come on. Come in. Welcome. We welcome all the lonely... all the unhappy ones. We founded a senior citizens club. Our goal is to promote contact between generations. Welcome. I ask you to applaud our visitors warmly. Let’s sit down and let’s get to know each other. I'm the vice president. Our president, unfortunately, is laid up in bed. Come in, come in. We don't have spirits... ...but good fruit juices and dessert wine. NOW, we dance blindfolded. We kiss men and women on the mouth. Now everyone do like me. One hand between the legs... ...and we catch the rider who is behind and in front. Like elephants. Get going. Life's hard for us here. For us too, out in the country. But you're young. You're 50 years old. How lucky you are to live with nature among the trees. It was our dream. That's my man. Ladies and gentlemen... I can't resist it... I can't see a trapeze without climbing on it. It's 30 years since I did it, so be forgiving. You'll see my underwear, but at my age... ...it doesn't matter. Introduce us to your boy. We'll hire him in my brother's restaurant. It's a vegetarian establishment, but we cook there. I have to talk to you. Something very serious. Alright... I want us to get married. Let us live together. Otherwise... Otherwise it's all over. If I invited all these fools to come here, ...it was to be with you. Excuse me, were you talking to me? I had put in my earplugs. Come to bed. If it's serious, and I believe it is, we'll talk about it again tomorrow. Here... Thank you Sir. Last night I thought a lot. I think I'm going to start again. Go back into farming. I talked about it with my son. He agrees. Tell me... ...you, who's been married for almost 30 years... What do you think about marriage? Often, when I'm in bed beside my wife... I watch her sleep and I wonder. I wonder if I'll see her on her deathbed... ...or if it'll be her who sees me. It's not that I wish her to leave before me... ...but it's a question that I ask myself. I love a woman, she pleases me, but I don't know which one. Watch you step. You weren't in your room. No. I didn't sleep a wink. The driver? No not at all. Coming home this night, I lost my key. I'm searching and I meet a man in a hounds-tooth suit. He said to me... ''I have bourbon at home.'' I didn't know what that was. Him and me, all night, we talked. He's a homosexual... ...but charming. You will be good, I hope. You can have every confidence in me. Thanks. Bye. Here we are... Look...! You can see the houses. It's still beautiful country. We're lucky. Yes ! That's really true. Often we complain... but when we compare... In any case, it's our home. He speaks little, but he listens well. I gave him my conditions. I refuse to let him divorce. I prefer that he gives me monthly payments. Every year, we could treat ourselves to a trip. Tyrol, Spain... Thanks. It did me good. Where are we? It's true, what they say... ...that you didn't come into money, that you sold your house? If you'd been younger, I would have liked you. Excuse me ma'am. Hi, Zoe. Zoe... I understood everything. I'm a clown. I've always been a clown. And they're not taken seriously. Cheers. Good morning. Mathias, your brother is unemployed. Staff reduction. I'll see you to the door. I'll come one of these evenings. I'll bring you a hare, with marinade. You just have to cook it. If you're not here... ...I'll come back. If you want us to live together, I agree. We risk ruining everything, to be disappointed faster. There are decisions which shouldn't be made quickly. We'll speak again. Bye. Shortly after... ...Mathias was working as a road-mender. Louise continued to practice her nursing profession. They sometimes met in the evening, in winter more often than summer. The years did nothing to change their habits. It will soon be 10 years since they met. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
