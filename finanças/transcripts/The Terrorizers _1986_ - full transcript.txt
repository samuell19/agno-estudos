The Terrorizers It's almost daybreak! I'll be done soon Did I bother you? Take this to the wash It's gotten warm What's wrong? Can't sleep again? Thinking of the other rewrite The closer the dead line the less inspired I get Another rewrite? I've never seen you this distressed Relax Writing a novel shouldn't be this life-consuming Thought it was a small gambling den But they are armed with guns How many pieces they've got? Not sure. Should've called the Assault squad I did. Should be there soon Who blew the whistle? it was the landlord Freeze! Spread'em out! Don't move! it happened on the first day of spring If you truly feel for the seasons you'll discover that changes are merely endless rebirths of the past This spring, it is not different To this married couple their most serious problem was... Chief died of a stroke last night! We heard We were just talking about it Everyone is shocked Well, I sort of suspected something would come up But I didn't expect it to be a stroke though Didn't you notice he acted kind of weird lately? His life was so boring small incidents would turn into big troubles for him I heard he had an affair with another woman and his wife found out It's all hearsay though Well, I doubt it You can never tell He really smoked too much A carton only lasted him 2 or 3 days What I'm concerned about is his family Like his children's educational funds, the funeral, etc... Well, I feel the late Chief had made great contributions to the hospital and I feel from now on... We do have our policies regarding all these We'll make all the arrangements accordingly Yes, yes. I see... By the way, who has seniority between you and Jing? Well, we started at the same time We graduated the same year from the same school We were employed together by the hospital I was like him no family connections totally on our own. I like my job. It's stable... I had an offer elsewhere with much higher pay.... But I felt it was less secure, so I turned it down I'm used to this job and I deeply believe if I work hard I'll be rewarded with career advancements Sir, are you saying that... Oh, nothing I just wondering Anything else? No, nothing Thank you,Sir Sir, there's this one thing... Since the Chief has passed away I felt obliged to let you know about the scandal of cheating at the last open bidding The late Chief shouldn't be held responsible it was Jing Why wasn't I informed before? Jing's my good friend I shouldn't have said anything Ridiculous! One shouldn't protect a friend when a dead man has to shoulder the blame to his grave That exactly how I feel I'll look into this right away Oh...please take care of the late Chief's workload You'll be acting Chief or no Yes...of course Thank you,sir Do you need someone to teach you a lesson Why don't you leave? Just like your father! And don't come back! You've changed... A lot No. I'm not sure about that Why don't you come work for me? Am I qualified? Qualified or not, I want you I still remember how good you were If not you,then who? That was a long time ago I haven't worked for years You've been writing since then? After 3 years, this is all I've got to show for it I know this book I also know that I was in one of your short stories Shen got divorced He left his old job and came out on his own I went to his new office today He asked me to go work for him He even said It's really a waste to have someone like me at home it might not be a bad idea It's always nice to have jobs come to you for a change I'm about to become Section Chief What about Jing? He got himself in trouble Some big, big trouble Fucking bitch ! What the...?You're still alive? You're the only one that got away? Heard it was the landlord who snitched Old Y's too much running tables without giving the landlord a piece Didn't even pay a rent! Of course you can't find them They've all split town Some have gone down south Shun? Shun's in the slammer OldY's put away for life Are you looking to hideout? Come over here then Crowded places are the best Let me tell you the more crowded a place is the safer it is Don't you get it,dummy? it'is now 11:31 and 10 seconds it'is now 11:31 and 20 seconds it'is now... No, you made a mistake! Well, this is the right address the girl on the phone said You need 50 lunches and said you're filming a movie here Does it look to you like we are filming a movie? Take them away! Get out of here! Movies my ass... Young man, looking for a flat? Come, I'll let you rent it cheap No What do you mean, no? Then what are you here for? checking the meters? Fuck, ever since the shoot out no one wanted to rent this flat Damn people even started playing jokes on me 3 fire trucks came last night said this place is on fire When will this end, goddamnit! It's too late You're the only one that cared I'm so hurt, so very hurt... I don't want to live anymore! I've already taken a bottle of sleeping pills I am not joking, I don't want to live There's no sense in living There's no point Thank you...Good bye Hello, give me Dick! Don't give me shit If you don't get him I'll break both your legs! I don't know what to do anymore You know, at first I counted on some writing skills some real-life experiences whether they happened to me to my friends Characters, plots, that I heard about I jotted them down in my notebook But it's become so meaningless to write this way: I feel I've used up of my emotions My past 30 years I've used up it all so quickly Now I only know how to write about things between man and wife I can't think of anything else Because my world has become smaller and smaller Do you undertand? I don't know how others see your work When I read your stories I want to see you The 'you' in the past We become youthful again These things do not fade with time I've always had faith in you What are you thinking about? Nothing Does Li Jong know about our past? You've never mentioned to him about your past relationships? He has never asked me Then he really trusts you Yes No, that's not it What I mean is That's not trust... He never seemed to have cared You've got me all confused. Your ex-wife, what was she like? I didn't realize how hard it was for you to take my sudden wedding announcement until I read that story of yours it gave me a deep sense of guilt Novels are novels. Don't take it too seriously No need to confuse it with reality I'm going now Better find someone else to work for you Don't waste your time on me I have nothing to do with the open bidding Listen, I've been to Personnel Office yesterday The director has told me all about it! He just told me that... Keep your mouth shut! Listen to me You, be careful! I... Shit, I quit! I'm leaving today They put me under investigation They said I cheated on the last open bidding. I don't even know the date when the bidding took place Now that the Chief's dead who knows what actually happened? it must be that punk kid who framed me Besides you, he's the only one that knows the details of it You think so? Director is holding me responsible Shit. Just because the chief died. Doesn't mean he was perfect I'm not going to be the scapegoat! What... you're smoking again? Didn't you quit? It's OK. Take it easy.. You can always rewrite it tomorrow You haven't been drafted yet? So where have you been hiding? The whole world's been here looking for you Your girl friend was here Your old man was asking for you too Well, not bad, huh?

My wife hasn't been home for 3 days Have you asked her friends? I don't want people to know Not even her family What can I do? Unless it's a kidnapping or something how can I be of help? Has there been anything unusual about her recently? For instance... Besides being unhappy with her writing Nothing really unusual Editor's not in until 6 or 7 There's no one at the newspaper Speaking it was the editor He said he talked to her Saids she may be somewhere finishing her novel, maybe she needs quiet to concentrate I feel much better now She'll be back in a few days Awhile back, she wanted a child it didn't work out. She was quite depressed and started writing all day I went along with it Lately, she seems to have grown a bit restless again No one believed she'd marry you I guess it must be my fault I knew she likes fancy things And a more comfortable lifestyle Luckily, I'm about to be promoted to Section Chief Maybe it will help the situation We'll see Buddy, you need to call more often Come by only when you need help What am I to you?

All I need is a few books Doesn't it bother you, looking at this mess? I'm moving out I've already found a place I'm moving out tonight I need new surroundings A change of lifestyle I've already started working I've given up writing I'm not the type to begin with If it was going to be like this why bother giving up such a good job to stay home and write in the first place What have I done wrong?

You know, If it wasn't for the baby This would have happened long ago I was so sick and tired of my job I was afraid that my whole life would pass by like that You know, when I locked myself in the study Thinking up those pretty lines it was to forget those painful memories to forget about the lost baby If you don't understand by now You'll never understand ! Every time, you misunderstand me or blame me Maybe I wasn't fair to you but I know what kind of life I need When we got married I thought it would be a new start To try and have a baby was also a new start To try writing again Was yet another new start Leaving you now is also a new start What good is all this?
