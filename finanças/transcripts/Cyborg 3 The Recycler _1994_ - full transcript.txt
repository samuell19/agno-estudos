03 Cyborg 3 The Recycler - Sci-Fi 1994 English [WOMAN] The golden age had ended, and ended badly. Humankind and cyborg kind had ceased to be partners. For 200 years they had built us to be their friends, do their bidding, fight their wars, cook their food and share their beds. But the last of the great corporations was dead and gone. And with its passing began the dark time, when the humans hunted us for our parts, our circuitry... and our souls. And no-one was safe. [BEEPING] I've got him! Let's go! Arggh! Hello, hello, hello. What we got here, eh? Please, mister... I'm just a poor dirt farmer. You don't want me. I've got a wife and a family. [FARMER] Please let me go. No, no. Wait. I've got friends. They're just what you're looking for. I'll take you straight to 'em. Oh, really, squire? Yes. For a very reasonable price. Oh. [MECHANICAL VOICE] Please don't. You're decreasing my vision capability by 50%. You're making a mistake. I can't take you to my friends without my eyes. [CYBORG] Please don't. You know, there's two things I hate - that's a liar and a beggar. Finish him, Jocko. [THUD!] [BIRD CALLS] Spare parts and pocket money for a week. I tell you, Jocko, the pickings getting slim here. It's time to move on to greener pastures - the free zone. The free zone's off limits. To the right man no place is off limits. I mean, just imagine it - 500 square miles of un-policed terrain. It's a cyborg haven and a recycler's dream. Somewhere out there is the mother lode. Cytown. Like the fabled elephants' graveyard of old. With enough cyber parts and pieces to put an old recycler right in the lap of luxury for life. All we've gotta do is find it. No-one else has. What makes you so sure it exists? Oh, they've found it alright... they just haven't lived to tell the tale. [PHONE RINGS] Yes? Lord Talon here. Hello, Lord Talon. How are you this fine and lovely day, sir? Excuse me, but may I ask, who the hell am I speaking with? Anton Lewellyn, sir. Coming to you live from the fringes of the vast wasteland. Ah, yes. Thank you. The one-eyed Jack, hmm? Well... what do I owe this pleasure? Well, I have an extraordinary opportunity that I believe, sir, will fetch a rather handsome price. Oh, yes, like the last one. I'm still trying to recoup my losses. Oh, Lord Talon, how was I to know that the unit had a glass shadow explosive implant in him? Well, don't worry, Mr Lewellyn. Why don't you bring the opportunity by? I'm sure we can do some business. Looking forward to seeing you, sir. Yes, I... I'm looking forward to seeing you too. [DEVICE BEEPS] Mm-hm. Thank you. Could you... polish this one? [GRUNTS WITH EFFORT] Ah, nice... nice jump ship. What year? What year? Arggh! Ow! Oh! Spare parts. Have mercy. Hey, watch the coat! Aw, jeez, Recycler, anything you got! Cerebral cable, syn flesh. Will work for chips. Oh... oh, Recycler. Spare parts. Have mercy! Recycler! Lend me your ear. Perhaps just a finger! Now, that's a fair request. Jocko, give the man a finger. [SQUELCHING] Oh, come, come, Lord Talon, it's good stock. Don't force me to go elsewhere. [EXCLAIMS] [LAUGHS] Ah, but, Mr Lewellyn, as you can see, it's got no eyes. And to quote an old parable, take it or leave it. [CRIES OUT] Perhaps you were right - perhaps I'm paying you too much, you ignoble recycler. [CRIES OUT] At first I really missed my own hand. But, you know, in time I found that this new one had certain advantages. A manicure only took half as long. And at 12lb of pressure I found that it made a very acceptable manacle. Well, don't you think? [CRIES OUT] At 20lb it will make you scratch your testicles till you bleed. [LEWELLYN CRIES OUT] At 20lb, well... It stops the circulation. At approximately 50lb I'm advised it will crush the bones, and at 60lb, you will leave your hand with me. Arggh! Arggh! And I see it also conducts electricity too, uh? [GUN FIRES] ARGGH! Well, la-di-da. It's good to be back in civilisation, eh? [WOMAN GROANS] [WOMAN 2] You looking for a good time? Recycler, come and get a piece of me. Come on. You looking for a good time? [WOMAN] Come back here. I'll take you both on. [WOMAN] Screw you, you silicone bitch. He's mine. [WOMAN 2] I'm triple-jointed! [WOMAN 2] Get me outta here! [HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] My, my, my, my, my. [MAN] Say, player! Say, player! Over here, man. Bring your ass over here, man. Come on, play me, brother! Ooh, you a big one. Oh, man, it's a barbarian! Come on, come on, big guy. Come on, pull my stick! Try a trick with my stick! You can do it. Come on, big guy, you can do it. Come on, big guy. Come on, try your luck. Ooh-ooh. Your money's welcome here, recyclers aren't. Oh, don't worry, lovey, I'm not collecting. I just want to use them for a while. Perhaps you'd like to use a real woman. No, thank you, my dear. I prefer a turn-on I can turn on. Well, well. [WOMAN] Hello? Hello?! Doc Edford? [WOMAN 2] Who is it? Who's there? It's me - Cash. Oh, Cash! How are you, dear? Oh! What brings you to Silica? Where's Colt? Um... Colt died. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, it's just a matter of time, you know. That's the way it is with us humans - they just don't build us the way they used to. He was a good friend. To us both. [MACHINERY BEEPS] [CASH] I've never felt this way before. All my sensors read hyponormal. Easy, dear. No need for panic. Oh, your fluid levels are low. Something's sucking the energy from your reactor cells. A plumbing problem? It all started the day I buried Colt. Now I feel it in my gut works every morning. [RAPID BEEPING] [GASPS] Oh, sweet mother of God. It can't be. But... well... in all my years of staring at these screens I never thought I'd live to see THIS day. I mean, if you were human maybe, but... well, see for yourself. [EDFORD] Oh, there is definitely a second heartbeat. I don't know how or why, but you're pregnant. Well, get rid of it. It's taking down my power - I can feel it. Take it out of me! I don't know how. Well, I wouldn't even know where to start with you. I could kill you. If you don't... It will. May I have your card, please? Oh. [BEEP!] Ah... Anton Lewellyn. You've purchased the full treatments. Mmm. I am Elexia. What would you like to do first? My, my, my, ducky, I wouldn't know where to begin. Then why don't we make ourselves a little more comfortable? Come and sit on the couch. Hmm. You're so strong and powerful. Oh, now, now, now. I bet you say that to all the lads. I've been with 51,227 men. Hmm. But I noticed you the moment you walked in. I felt your power then... and now. I can see it in your eyes. What may I call you? Call me... master. Well, master... let's get nasty. Oh... by all means. But why? I'm here for your pleasure. And my pleasure it will be. [INSTRUMENT WHIRRS] [SHRIEKS] I bet you never had a fellow like me before, eh? I got a better idea. Well, this won't hurt a bit, lovey. Or maybe it will. I'm not programmed for this. It's a mistake. Well, don't be so sure. I mean, clearly, you do have the hardware. Who knows what your creator intended? Here, take this. You can monitor your energy drain. If you start to get into the red then you can just... isn't it already too late? Oh, no, no. I'm thinking, there is a man. He's, um... well, he used to be some sort of a... visionary programmer - a genius from the golden age. He lives in the zone, way out in the north-west quadrant of the badlands. His name is... uh... Evans. Baby... he may be your only hope. [BEEPING] Pardon me, miss, but we're strangers here and I was wondering if you could tell me where a couple of hungry gentlemen might be able to satisfy their appetite. Sorry, I wouldn't know. Excuse me. [TUTS] Oh, that's a pity. I was about to ask if you'd like to join us. I can't. Well, maybe you'd care to reconsider, eh? I wouldn't count on it. Perhaps another time, uh? Interesting young woman, eh? She's no woman. A cyborg? What the hell is she doing driving around the streets all alone? Imagine the price she'd fetch, uh? You know, Jocko, I feel a pain coming on. Sorry, Doc, we don't have an appointment. But we are in need of your services. Well, you... don't exactly fit my typical patient profile. Most of them have more balls than the two of yah! My, my, my, my, my. Whatever has happened to professional courtesy, huh? Of course, you see, Doc, my associate and I, we're doctors too. Specialists in removing unwanted problems like yourself. So perhaps maybe you could use our services, eh? Not if you were the last one-eyed freak on earth. Jocko, help the lady up. [CRIES OUT] Now all you have to do is allow me to remove a little something that's been gnawing at your insides. Or perhaps you might tell me what the cyborg woman was doing here, eh? She came to the wrong place. I have never seen her before. Oh. I could not help her. You know, my associate here, he doesn't believe in anaesthesia. So perhaps... you'd like to help yourself. She's just an old worn-out model. She wanted some replacement parts. I didn't have any and I sent her away! Well, where's her owner? I have good reason to doubt your credentials, sir. No, really? Oh, you disgust me, you one-eyed jackal. Jocko. [CRIES OUT] Arggh! [THUD!] My, my, what do we have here? The price just went up. [CRIES OUT] I don't want this! [VEHICLE APPROACHES] She is close. After her! She's changed course again. Stay with her. [DEVICE BEEPS] [ELECTRONIC SOUNDS] [COMPUTERISED VOICE] Function overload. Efficiency decrease 6.5%. [DISTORTED ELECTRIC GUITAR WAILS] Thank you! Thank you very much, everyone! Goodnight. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Goodnight. Drive safely. [CASH] Who are you?! [ECHOES] What is this place?! You're backstage at the edge of creation. Are you Evans?! Are you cyborg or human? Does it matter?! Actually, no. I've pretty much had it with the set and the subset. Are you Evans?! Repetitive interrogative serial strain. You should have that checked, you know. Hey! My name is Cash! Hey! Wait! Please, I have to talk to you! I need your help. You have no idea what you need - no ideas at all. You haven't had an original thought since the nanosecond you came online. I know I don't like you. Yes, well, that's hardly an original thought, but it's good programming for 60-year-old gear. [CASH] Dr Edford in Silica told me how to find you. Sorry, the repair shop's permanently closed. Something is draining my power. There isn't much time. I can't help you. Edford thinks I might be pregnant. That cannot be. There is a second heartbeat. A 195-C40? No. No. They talked about the designs, but no prototypes had ever been built. Ever. Give me that. [DEVICE BEEPS] [COMPUTERISED VOICE] Efficiency decrease 6.6%. Something's definitely happening alright. Hey! Relax, I've done this 1,000 times. Stand still. There you have it - an on board in-vitro chamber. Incredible. A cybernetic womb and a cryogenic sperm bank. It's all here in your schematics. Now that we know what it is... get it the hell out of me. You're creating another life. Right now something is growing inside of you. You're going to be a mother, Cash. Maybe they were right. Maybe you don't have the emotional wet works. You're not just a cyborg any more! No. Now you're a creator. Imagine - humans and cyborgs together. And you're the metallurgical earth mother - the beginning of it all. Yeah, well, I don't want to be the beginning of anything. You have no choice. [COUGHS] What have you got on the bloodhound? Steady Radagen trace. Not strong, but enough to keep us locked on her. How many hours lead? At least 20. Well, it's only a matter of time until we catch the little bitch. And then? Well, as much as I'd like to rip her bloody wiring out by hand, this one's different. Why do you do this? Well, it's my ministry. My calling, you might say. [BEEPING] [GASPS] Ow! [WHIMPERS] What took you so long? Radagen trail stops at the edge of the canyon. Either she went in or she's right below us. You nearly killed yourself and the baby as well. How is it? It's fine, in spite of your best efforts. I'm sorry. I'm afraid. I just thought I could shut it off somehow. Its survival instincts are as strong as yours and mine. It created a power surge to save both of you. It was a warning. [GASPS] I can see its face. [ALARM BEEPS] What's that? Expecting anyone? Recyclers. Two of 'em. I thought I lost 'em a couple of days back. Nice of you to let me know you were being followed. What have they got? Jump ship. Artillery and heavy armour. How far out's your perimeter? Half a mile. Follow me. We're on it, Jocko. Won't be long now, my boy. What the hell is that? Adequate defence. [CASH] impact triggered explosive heads? All I know is that they'll stop practically anything. My experience with it, however, is somewhat limited. Great. Get out of the way. Fire in the hole. We're under attack. What the hell are you talking about? I don't hear a bloody thing. [CASH] Maybe not. [WHISPERS] Go. Hey! So, where are we going? To the only place the two of you will be safe Cytown. I thought that was just a myth. No, just a well-kept secret. So, do you know where this place is? Not exactly, but I know how to find it. That way. [JOCKO] We're still going after them? [LEWELLYN] Of course, but not alone. It's time we rekindled some of our old alliances. They're headed to Cytown, I'll bet my good eye on it. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm alright. You're overheating. Shut down and let me take over. No-one drives my cruiser but me. What's wrong? What's happening? I don't know. Check the gauges. Everything reads normal. That's what I thought. Get out quickly and run. What for? Just do it! You don't understand. I can fix it. Oh, well, what in the hell are we gonna do now? We are stuck in the middle of nowhere! We've got two recyclers on our tail, my cruiser just bought it, and if we don't find this figment of your misguided imagination we will be next! But we're not searching any more. We're here. What is this - some kind of force-field? They got a scrambler that jams unshielded electronics. It cooks an engine's microprocessor, hence the fireworks. So you drove my cruiser into this knowing it would explode? Well... you see, I didn't exactly know where the force-field was. So, I mean, we had to find it somehow. Right? [EVANS] Look, I know you're fading. I'm fading too. If we can just go a little longer, we're nearly there. [SARCASTICALLY] Oh, we're nearly there. That's what you said 10 hours ago. I didn't realise how wide the perimeter was. Obviously. Now I know. [MUSIC PLAYS FAINTLY] Let's go, Hale. How many cards do you want? I don't have all century to wait for you to make up your mind. Two, please. Thank you very much. And you, Decaf - how many cards would you like? Decaf! Hey! Decaf?! [STUTTERS] Of drawing into a four of a kind, uncertain with a new deck. Uh... give me... um, let's see... Give me... two. [GRUNTS] You know you take all the fun out of the damn game?! I'm out! New game, gentlemen. New game. We seem to have picked a bad time. I don't think they like us. What do you mean 'us'? You're not welcome. She needs help. We're being chased by a couple of recyclers. Tough luck, human! I thought this was the free zone. Do we look free to you? Go ahead, Donovan. Get this over with. Me first! I can't fight you. I don't see that you have a choice. I believe I'm next. Wait! [STUTTERS] I know this human. I don't remember you. [STUTTERS] He... Evans. Charles Osborne Evans. [STUTTERS] He wrote the software for the 204 series. This guy is a bloody genius. He wrote my... How long have you had the synoptical drift? [STUTTERS] Oh... er... 56,024 hours, 22 minutes and 14 seconds. I see. Any trouble staying online? [STUTTERS] Oh, not that I am aware of. [ALL] Yes! Uh... may I? Uh... sure. Uh, you're gonna feel a significant pressure at the base of your skull. Bear with me. Any improvement? As a matter of fact, the circuit flow intensity between my main synapse registering the auxiliary input to my central... speech bank - yes, absolutely. Much, much better. Thank you. Heh. Maybe we should let Doc Evans stick around for a while. Thank you. They can't stay! They'll be the end of us all. Bold words for a newcomer. She's not exactly one of us. And if the recycler who did this to me is after her, he will not stop until he gets what he wants. He's already killed a woman. A doctor. In Silica. Doc Edford? Why would a recycler kill a human? Because of me. He knows. He must know. [ALL] Knows what? I'm pregnant. How is that possible? Absolutely amazing. The technology's been around for 100 years. It's just never been done before. The newcomer's right. We can defend ourselves against a couple of bounty hunters. We've done that before. But broken-down cytrash like us don't stand a chance against the army of recyclers that's sure to come. They'll dismantle us all. I say we get rid of them. Before the recyclers get rid of US. We can't just send them out to be slaughtered. We don't owe them anything! Yes, we do. He's a creator. 42.957% of the units walking around this town were built from his designs. Each and every one of us owe our existence to this man or someone like him. [ELEXIA] And what about her? Yes, she's a cyborg, but something incredible is happening here and every one of us knows it. She is the first of our kind to become one of their kind. We're all part creator because of her - and that makes me feel proud. She is living proof that we are not just a machine. She is our future. If she dies, we all die. We must protect her to save ourselves. Can you help her? I want to thank you, my friends, for showing up on such a short notice and I see you're all here. Johnny and Jimmy O'Hara - how's things in Silica, eh? And Jean-Pierre. I see you brought all your bad boys. Excellent. And, Gunther, you redesigned those slaughter wheels, eh? [GUNTHER] The more firepower, the better! [MEN] Yeah! Good. We're going to need it. But first, gentlemen, let's get down to the business at hand. Over those hills lies a treasure beyond your wildest imagination. Now, you've all heard of it and you've longed for it. Yet most of you doubted that it ever even existed. Yet I alone found it and together we're gonna share in the wealth. [MAN] What are you yapping about, Lewellyn? Cytown, my boy. The capital of the free zone. A metropolis of unowned cyborgs just wandering around, clear and free. Easy pickings, eh? [MAN] What are we waiting for? Let's go! [MEN] Yeah! No, hold on, not just yet. There's still some loose ends that gotta be tied up. Meanwhile, Jocko and I have acquired some of Silica's finest brandy and there's plenty for all. So we'd like to ask you lads if you'd like to join us in a wee bit of a drink before the slaughter, eh? [MEN WHOOP AND CHEER] This is as close to a lab as we've got. It'll have to do. A pregnant cyborg - it makes you think. Do any of these surgical gear work? Well, we don't know. We've collected tons of junk from around the zone, but, then again, we're not creators. What about that? Force-field's core. Here as long as any of us can remember. Created by the founders of Cytown for protection. Advanced units, I imagine. Well, as a manner of speaking... Then again, they didn't give us the ability to fix ourselves. Most humans don't possess that ability. It takes a vision that very few possess. I have a vision. I dream of one day being able to stand on legs. To walk again. Doc, you think maybe you could help an old unit who's... Sure, Hale, of course. I'll do my best. You're not the only one with a dream. Do you know what it's like to be programmed to be a hero and not have the ability to fight? I still have sensations in my trigger fingers that aren't there. I know. I know what it's like. Just once to hold a sword in my hand again and fight the way I once did. There was a time I lived to build cyborgs. I was in awe of what you could accomplish. Faster, stronger - more perfect than I ever dreamed of being. I envied every single one of you. I haven't felt that way in a long time. Arggh! Ohh! Quick - get her up. [CASH CRIES] What's happening? Help me! Guys, you're gonna have to clear out and give me some room to work, please. Not you, Decaf. You stay and connect her. [CASH CRIES OUT] Oh, my God. I don't believe it. What is it? She's going into some kind of labour. But how can that be? She's only been pregnant a few weeks. Cash, try and relax. Shut down all non-essential systems. Trust me to get you through this. Something is definitely wrong. What will you do? I don't know. We're gonna have to open her up. Evans, please. Evans, please... Cash, relax. OK, release your abdominal plate now. Doc, what is it? It's the end of the first trimester. A baby? A miracle. [MEN EXCLAIM] You OK? Yeah. Come on, get up. [MAN GROANS] Oh, that hurts, man. Lewellyn, we've found the force-field. It fried the bikes, so we're walking. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. Where's the baby? Yeah, we wanna see the baby. The baby is still in the incubator. Well, bring him out. He's beautiful. When's he gonna come out of that thing? Uh, not for a few months. It's a womb with a view. Cash, what does it feel like? There's no program for it. This is the greatest thing that's ever happened to us. No, it's not! It's the worst. It'll be the end of us all. They're gonna come for it and they'll take us all down to get it. Yeah, when that time comes, we'll just have to be ready to fight. With what? Hooks and claws? Wheelchairs and canes? I don't think so! Look, Jocko, we've got to get beyond that force-field. You're the only one that can get close enough to find it and bring it down. They'll never suspect a cyborg coming in on foot. Just be one of them. Why? Well, it's nothing personal. Now you're a freak like them! [WOMAN] What's he? [MAN] That's a series 2000 - he's a warrior. That's cool, no problem. So, anyway... Hey, it's the orb. [DOOR RATTLES] What'd you bring me? Look inside. The baby? Outstanding, Jocko. They've gotta come after this. Cytown... is gonna be mine. And, Jocko - not a word to the others. What are we supposed to do - glue it back together? None of us knows how to repair the force-field. The founders gave us more credit than we deserve. Cash is gone. So is her gear. Forget about her. We got bigger problems. The force-field's down and the way I see it, it's all your fault. Doc can fix it, can't you, Doc? I don't know. I don't know. The technology is so different. You don't have any schematics or back-up gear? Lost to the ages. Like I said, the force-field's been here longer than any of us. I knew this was gonna happen. We're doomed. Now there's nothing to stop the humans from coming in here with their machines. Forget about the force-field! You're not gonna bring that back! You people don't seem to get it, do you? The future of your entire race depends on Cash and the baby! You've gotta bring 'em back! He's right. We gotta find them. Look, if Cash doesn't reach that canister in time, the baby is finished - it's pure and simple! I say we round up every fighting unit in town and we take them on head to head. Odds of victory implementing that plan are 0%. Well, I think I can improve those odds. Fix the force-field, human - or we're doomed! Maybe I can fix it. I'll do what I can... cyborg. [FLOOR CREAKS] [BOOM!] Rise and shine, lovey. Now, tell me - what were you doing trespassing on my vehicle, eh? Where's my baby? The little rodent is just fine. Ah, you see, Jocko, how refined the mothering instinct is in this programming. Touching, eh? I wonder if we could find out just how you work. I'm not afraid. Do what you want. Oh, no, no, no. Not quite yet. These goods are much too valuable. I'm just gonna have to find me another toy in Cytown. I'm what you came for. Just keep me. There's nothing else for you there. How naive. You're just the tip of the iceberg. Before I'm through, I'm gonna have my way with every one of you simple machines. Make no mistake about it - I'm the meanest bastard you'll ever meet, cyborg or human. You push me and no matter how much you're worth, I'll wipe your memory and make you a pleasure unit. My own pleasure unit. Jocko, watch our inventory. More to follow, darling. How can you betray your own kind? Lewellyn is my kind. No! You see what he is, what he does! It's what I do. Is it really? Try to remember what you were before he wiped your memory. It doesn't matter. Lewellyn owns me now. Are you just taking orders? How long will that last? You will be next! Don't you see? As soon as your parts become more valuable than your services, he will take pleasure in ripping out your eyes and selling you for scrap. Search deep inside your software, inside your soul... I... I can't... do it. I... I can't. Let me help you. Connect with me. Jacques Denard. Cyteck 2400. Classification - medi-rescue. Online activation - 4/2/2196. Service record - 227 rescue missions. 1,247 successful field surgeries. Status - illegal removal... 9/27 /2146. Jacques, you were stolen! You used to save lives. Do you remember? I don't know how any more. I can teach you. Take me to my baby. I can't. Lewellyn would shut me down. Jacques, I'm afraid too. I'm afraid my baby's going to die. Please help me save him. It's what you were programmed to do. I don't want him to die. [SINGS] I don't care. I'm no cyborg. I'm no cyborg. I'm no Cyborg! I'm no cyborg yet! I'm a human being. I'm a human being. I'd forgotten I was programmed to imagine such a possibility. It feels good, doesn't it? Yes. My, my, my! I spy with my good eye that one of us might need a tune-up, eh? Cross me again, Jocko, and I'll sell your carcass to the highest bidder. Arggh! Stop her! Stop her! Recycle that. Come on. I'm gonna get you out of here. I would imagine they will try and come in through this canyon here because it has the lowest... Thank God! Are you alright? How's the baby? We've both lost a lot of fluid. Yeah, you're too weak to transfuse now. We're gonna have to hold off until later. Look, he's coming and he is not alone. He's built a strike force. His jump ship, a few sand rails and desert bikes at least 50-strong. And he's not just coming for me. He wants us all, dead or alive. They're not taking me alive. I'm never going back. She's right. This is our home. If there's to be a next generation, we have to make a stand. We all have to fight... together. Alright, gentlemen, listen up. Here's our strategy. Jean-Pierre, you and your lads will come in from the east. Gunther, you and your boys will come up from the south. Meanwhile, Jocko and I will roar down from the north. We'll all meet in the middle of the dry lake bed and then we'll converge on Cytown like a tongue of fire from hell! We'll take them by surprise. They'll never know what hit them. But keep one thing in mind - the bitch and the canister, they belong to me. [MEN WHOOP AND CHEER] Hale, are you sure we're doing the right thing? We've come too far to turn back now. But we took an oath. We never took an oath to die. Show 'em, El Sid. That's a significant amount of firepower. We've had a lot of unwelcome visitors. Is all of this weaponry? [HALE] In a manner of speaking. Cyborgs don't exactly bury their dead. A cyborg graveyard. OK, Sid. Just hold still one second. Almost there. [Grunts] OK. Oh, this is so exciting, Doc. How's the arm feel? It feels good. it feels strong. Stronger than the original, I think. All you need is a synthetic flesh sleeve. You'll be fine. Great! [TOOL BUZZES] Now, we have a slight problem. You're a 260 series, I could only find a 240 limb, so... Ugh! I just... I don't have the swivel valve or the joint, I... I'm sorry, Hale, I just... I don't... I can't do it. It's OK, Doc. You did your best. Don't worry about my hands, Doc. Just weld these into my servos. How's that? Let's see. Good job, men. [BEEPING] Come and get it, you pussies. [YELLS] Wonder how many men I'll have today. Firepower improved 400%. Come and get us. Odds of victory... too close to call. I used to be a pleasure unit. I'm not any more. Oh, come on, now. Come on. Lewellyn! Let her go. Not till I've got her eyes about my neck. Jocko! You're mine now, junk man! Take 'em. Take 'em! Never again. Are you daft? I own you. Not any more. This is the free zone. Have you lost your bloody head? I could kill you right now. Now, don't force me to. Now drop that god damn gun, metal head! I said, "Drop it." Drop it! Now, listen up. Baby and I, we're gonna take our leave and if any of you wretched androids make one move, I'm gonna destroy this canister. Go ahead. Take it. Destroy the canister. Do what you want. We can't all sacrifice our lives for one baby. What are you saying? What's the difference? Why should a child live in a world where his parts are worth more than he is? Where eyes are worn like jewellery and life means nothing. Please, have mercy on my baby. Destroy the canister. [WOMAN] Cash, no! You're bluffing. Take a good look at the future, Recycler. [GASPS] Sweet mother of God. The bitch has got some interesting programming. Come on, quickly. We haven't much time - follow me. It was the only place to keep the temperature under control. I'm not one of a kind, just the only one to survive... so far. [CASH] The dark time was over and a new, golden age was about to begin.
