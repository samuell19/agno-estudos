Good morning. - What the hell are you doing here? - Picking some stuff up. - I thought I'd jump into bed with you. - Piss off. Are you naked? Don't you think I'm prepared? - What's up? - Not much. You? What's that? That's new. - Yes. - Okay! - Awesome. - Thank you. - Are those Gothic letters? - Yeah. - That's funny. What does it say? - Can't you read it? I want you to say it. What does it say? "Success is temporary. Loyalty is forever." - That's hardcore. - Yes. - Did Mum see it? - She's gone. She doesn't see anything. - That's probably for the best. - Definitely. She'll go mad when she sees it. - Where is she? - She's travelling. That's perfect. Maybe we could hang out. I could move in for a few days? I'm not so sure. You know... You just can't. Why not? I came here to see you. You're all tough because you got a tattoo? Shouldn't you be at school? - It's Easter. Shouldn't you be going? - Sure, I will. Good luck, tough guy. - What's up? - What's up? - How are you doing? - Fine, and you? - Are you ready for later? - Of course. - And you? - For sure. - Did you talk to your brother? - Yeah, I did. - Can I join? - Sure, no problem. Stop smiling like that. Are you sure? I'm just kidding. You're always welcome. What's this? You're watching porn in an internet café? Who the hell is this? She's my big brother's ex-girlfriend. You're looking at your brother's ex? That's crazy. - Mohammed, come here! - Don't call Mohammed. Chill out, he can look at her too. - Don't you want to shag her? - No, she's my brother's. - Are you in love with her? - No, let's go! Stay here, where are you going? Well, I just started school again after a long break. And it's hard getting up in the morning. It's hard meeting new people and adjusting to life. I thought yesterday was terrible, since I came home - - I felt like I needed the drugs. It feels good - - that I’m beginning to know people within the Narcotics Anonymous Community - - that I can connect with when I’m through with this treatment. I had a weird day yesterday. I learned a lot about myself - - about socializing in the "real world". It's really a big issue for me. So I'll have to work on that. I went home and tried to deal with some past experiences - - forgotten memories. So I brought... ...Paddy here to help me. He's been with me all the way, seen everything. My mother gave him to me. I don't remember much from back then. We lived in a women's commune, consisting of feminists only. They burned bras, and men were denied access. Let's talk about your mother. You were supposed to get back in touch with her. Yeah, that’s going really well. I went home to pick up Paddy and we talked. I said hello to my brother as well. That was great. I miss him. I hope I can spend more time with him when I'm done with this treatment. - I think that's all. - Thank you, Niklas. - What's that for? - You need to take a test. - I did one last week. - You did. Now I'd like another. Do you have something against me? I assume you don't want to go back to isolated rehab in the countryside. I have to work. I'll do it next time. Niklas. (Birthday song) - Blow out the candles, Kevin. - Yes, sir. - Whoa! - Oh. You only have one girlfriend. No, no. That's an awesome birthday cake. Listen up! When we're done eating, we've planned some activities. Kevin, Christian and Niklas are going on a trip for Kevin's birthday. Kevin gets to choose and he has decided to go out with the guys. But there's also a present. Wow! - Wow, your biggest idol? - A T-shirt with Rasmus Seebach. - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! Are you ready to play a game? The winner decides the first activity of the day. - That was close. - It was this close. Your turn, Kevin. No! I've just got to check the wind direction. Now I'll show you how to hit the crossbar. - No! - I'll show you, okay? - Come on, let's go to the van. - Huh? I won, so I get to decide our first destination. (Rasmus Seebach song is playing) Go slow to begin with, keep the fists up and give me some harder punches. You're a good fighter. Look at the dummy. He's so ugly. - Is there any difference? - No, they just protect your teeth. I'll take the red one. It's badass. Look at that fool. - What's up? - Good to see you. - I'm Michael. - Frederik. Are you ready for later? Keep close to me. I'll protect you. - Look at those jerks. - No, no, stop! I'm tapping out. - What's up, bro? Good to see you. - You too. - This is the new guy I talked about. - Hi, I'm Peter. Frederik. - So you're all set? - Yeah, otherwise I wouldn't be here. I just need to know if you'll chicken out when it turns ugly. If you're going to bail, let me know. - Don't push him. - He can speak for himself! So when a drugged-up beast comes right at you, you'll stand your ground? - Don't laugh. This is serious shit. - I know. This is it! - So, you have the guts? - I'm ready. He's ready, okay? Now, shake hands. All right. Let's see what you are made of. Move over, guys. Take a seat, Frederik. You little bastard. - Be polite. She's an old lady. - We always are. - Her name is Karen? - Yes. - Hello, Niklas. - Hello, Grandma. This is Kevin. - It's his 40th birthday. - Happy birthday, dear. And here's my buddy, Christian. Say hello to my grandma. - My pleasure. - Welcome, Christian. You can sit on my yellow couch. I believe there's room for two. Two fit young men. - What did you get for your birthday? - A T-shirt with my hero Rasmus Seebach. - Oh, who's that? - Rasmus Seebach. He's Tommy Seebach's son. He's a musician as well. - I also have a present for you. - For me? I'll go get it. Take your coats off, boys. - It's a nice couch. - Yes, it is. - You have a lot of nice old things. - There's more in that cabinet. - Old glasses. - From when you were young. - Look. I brought a present. - Oh, my! So what have you been up to? Are you having fun? Look at this. Aren't they beautiful? Yes, they're so beautiful. Wonderful. We have to get on with our day. - Take care, and thank you for coming. - You're welcome. I'll say goodbye and then I’ll be with you. "Niklas came to visit with Kevin and Christian from work." - We brought flowers. - Yes. - And had a nice time. - Yes, we did. Those flowers are beautiful. Tulips last a very long time. - Will you come back soon? - I will. Say hello... - Say hello to Mum. - Sure, I will. - Say hello to everyone. Bye. - Sure. - You're fine with what he said? - Sure, I don't take it personally. Okay. That's good. - Look at her! - Who? - The girl with the baby carriage. - Who is it? It's my brother's ex. I showed her to you on the computer. - So go say hello. - I can't. - Why not? You already know her. - I'm not sure. Then I'll go tell her you're afraid of talking to her. - Are you crazy? - You want to jerk off your entire life? - Don't you want to fuck her? - I do. What do I tell her? Don't worry about it. You'll figure it out. - Fuck you. - I know you can do it! Don't worry. I'll bring him along then. I know it's not your problem. That's fine. Okay, bye. - Hi. - I just wanted to say hello. - Congrats. I didn't know you had a baby. - Oh no, that's... - That's my friend's. - Okay. I was a little surprised too. - So you're in eighth grade now? - No, ninth actually. So I'm almost done. And you're still working with the mongols? No, it became awkward after that thing with me and Niklas. So now I'm just taking care of people with regular disabilities. - I just need to change his diaper. - Sure. This place is disgusting. Frederik, would you mind helping me? It’s nasty in here and there's nowhere to lie him down. - What about the carriage? - Just leave it. He's so tired. I know it's tough. There we go. Frederik was so good at helping you get a fresh diaper. Frederik was great at helping us out, right? - You did a good job. - It wasn't so bad. You did well. So where are you going now? Should I join you? - I have to go to work. - Right. Okay. Actually, I've tried to get in touch with Niklas. - He just got back from rehab. - Yes, I heard. I thought maybe I could borrow your phone and call him? Sure. - Isn't it a bit weird? - Yeah. - Never mind. - I'm calling him now. Good luck. - Could you keep an eye on him? - Yeah. - What's up, Frederik? - Hey, Niklas. This is Laura. - Why do you have Frederik's phone? - Hi, um... Can I speak to Frederik? Can we meet up and talk sometime? - I'm busy. - Sure, but... - Niklas, it's really... - Listen. I'm at work now. - I have to run. - Please just wait. - See you. Bye. - Right. Hello? - Thank you. - No worries. - See you. - See you. Bye. Okay, boys, sit down. Maybe you can watch a movie... ...while I go talk to them. I'll be back. Hi, we'll be ready in two minutes. It's time. - You just have to be a nice gentleman. - Okay. - Right, buddy? - Okay. - Should I go get her? - Yes. - Hi, I'm Amanda. - I'm Kevin. - We're going to play together. - Yes, I'm ready. - Then I'll undress a little bit. - Yes, I don't mind. Are you very nervous? Sure, but I'm trying not to be. - Am I too cold? - No. Good. - Hi. - Hello, my friend. You're playing like an amateur! What a lousy pass! Check this out. - Come on! - Why do you talk shit all the time? How could you miss that? What are you doing? Don't let that gypsy get away with our beer cans. Get him! Are you for real? - Do it yourself. - I'm not joking! Get him. I'll do it! What are you doing? Hey. Give me that. Give me that! Fucking give me that! Are you stupid? Stupid gypsy. Get out of my sight, you filthy dog. Good job, Frederik. You let your friend clean up your mess? - Are you broke or something? - You want to make a fool of yourself? - What's your problem? - My problem? First you let your friend take the fall and now you want to pick a fight? - You're a fucking joke! - Come on. - Are you serious? - Piss off. Piss off. - Are we ready for later? - Yeah, we'll smash those faggots tonight! Frederik, you can stay here! Kasper, calm down. - I need to calm down? - I didn't mean to... What? To embarrass me in front of my brother and his friends? - Go back to your new friends! - No. - We're going to the match together. - We're not going anywhere you and I. - Hey. - Hey. - What's going on? - I couldn't find a babysitter. - Isn't that a problem? - You think so? Well, I'm not the one to ask. - Hello. - Hello. - Is this okay with you? - It's fine. Okay, cool. I'll see you Thursday. - You bet. - Bye. - Just a sec, I'll go tuck him in. - Sure. - How are things? - Fine, and you? Great. I'll make dinner ready. The three musketeers! You won a teddy bear! Come on, Kevin, hurry up! I did it! Okay, the story goes like this: We went to the theme park... ...we ate burgers, and then we watched Batman in the cinema. Yes. Christian? It's true what you said. We went to the theme park. And... um... - We had burgers. - Yes. And besides that, I'll say, we tried out some rides. No! It's important that our stories about today are in sync. So, we'll say: We went to the theme park, we ate burgers and we watched Batman. But when I tell them we watched Batman in the cinema - - is that the same as going to the theme park and trying rides? No, it's not! We have to be able to explain a big gap in our day - - where we did some things we are not allowed to. All right? Nobody can know about this! So the matter of fact is that we haven't really been to the cinema. I know, that's why we have to lie. Okay, we went to the theme park, ate burgers and watched Batman. And now my turn: We went to the theme park - - ate burgers, and last but not least, we watched Batman. - That's it. - Perfect, boys! - Yes! - Cheers. Let's go to the party. Perhaps that was a little too much. Is it all right? - He actually swims? - Yeah. Babies can do that. Then they forget it, and when they grow up they have to learn it all over. That's how it goes. - Are you able to swim? - No. - Well, you can ride a horse? - Right. But even I have my limits. I don't believe you. Well, you shouldn't. Have you thought about taking more shifts? Well, I got accepted to college. - Congratulations. - Thank you. What does that mean? It means that starting this summer it'll take up a lot of my time. I won't have time to work here anymore. Well, let's celebrate that you got into college. Congratulations. No. - Stop it. - You like it, don't you? Don't you like it when people look at you? What are you talking about? I've been watching you. Don't you think I know who you are? Stop. Stop it! That's the door. Get out. Get out! - Do you want to go to Cassiopeia? - What's that? It's a brothel. - And you've been there? - No, but all the boys have. - How much is it? - Depends on what you'd like. You're already dreaming about it. Fuck that bitch Laura and those losers. Let's just go and have a good time. - Do you have any cash? - No, do you? - No. - Can't we steal it from your Mum? We spent it all already. Let's go to the park and rob one of those faggots. It's freezing. There's nobody there. Of course there is. Where else would they be? How do we do it? We'll split up and use different entrances. What if one of them tries something nasty? Then you'll mess up his ugly face with this one. Make sure you don't spray it in your own face. - Are you game? - Yeah. - Let's do it. - All right, let's go. - I'll call you when I'm at the entrance. - Okay. Hello? Are you all right? - I'll call a locksmith. - No, I don't want anyone else involved. - Then what do you want me to do? - Wait. - Are you sure I shouldn't call? - Just wait! Could you help me shower? I wet my pants. There she is with us. She was so nice and beautiful. What a wonderful woman. She was so wonderful. I helped her take her underwear off. - Hello. - Hello, boys, are you ready to party? - Ready to show some dance moves? - Yes. - We're excited. - Me too. - Hello. - What's up? I just wanted to know what was going on with you and Laura earlier. - What do you mean? - It's odd she calls me from your phone. I just bumped into her, okay? Leave me out of your mess. - You know she's a liar. - Is that the only reason you called me? - I need to go. See you. - Frederik, wait... Hi. Hi. Let's go over there. Let's sit down here. - Are you nervous? - No. - It's okay. - Well, I'm not. How old are you? You look a little young. I'm eighteen. - Is this your first time? - No. It's okay. - I know a good place over there. - Let's just sit here. You're very cute. - We won't do it if you don't want to. - Let's do it over there. Calm down, all right? We're not in a rush. What the hell? What the hell are you doing? Stop it! Are you mad? You don't have to do this! Are you all right? What's going on? He attacked me! Take it easy. Calm down. What's going on? He tried to spray me with a pepper spray. Fuck you! - You fucking faggot. - What did you say? - Let's go over here. - Fucking faggots! Are you afraid of queers? - What are you doing? - Are you assaulting queers? I'll kill you! - Frederik Bøgelund? - Hello, Frederik. - What are you doing here? - Fuck you. Take a picture. Take a picture of Frederik. - Make sure I'm not in the picture. - Lie still. Film this shit. Shut up, all right? - I'm recording. - Tell them what you've done. Get back here. You're not going anywhere. That's it. Do what I tell you! - Calm down. - Tell the camera what you're up to. - I'm on my way home. - With a pepper spray? I'll put a finger up your arse if you don't say what you're doing. - What are you doing? - What the hell are you doing? - He's had enough. - What are you doing? He's getting away. What do you think he'll do next? - Hey. - Hey, what's up? - Are they having fun? - Yeah. - Did you guys have fun today? - Indeed. - You had a good time? - Very. The boys are on cloud nine. Well, I don't know how to say this. Did you take them to a brothel? - What are you talking about? - It's against the rules. - I know. I didn't do it. - I just saw Kevin's pictures. - Okay. - You understand I have to report this? Did you talk to them? Did you ask them if they had a good experience? If I don't react and someone finds out, I'll be in trouble. Don't worry, you won't get in trouble. Either you quit voluntarily, or I'll report what you did. - Hello. - Where the hell are you? - I'm at the station. - I've been waiting for you for ages. One of those faggots tried to touch me, so I had to beat him up. - Seriously? - Yes, I tried to get him to the tunnel. But he got nasty, so I broke his nose. Cool. Did he have any money? He didn't have a dime. Screw that, I'll come pick you up. Right, I'll see you. Get yourself together! What's up with you? You're all stoned. Hello? - Somebody's knocking on your door. - Then go open it. Hi.
