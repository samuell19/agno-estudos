- 7:30, Halsted! - Nice one, loser! - How many's that? - 92 and counting. - We're supposed to get out today for a bit. - Step nine, making amends. Can't wait. - Let's go. Good morning. - He hit on me yesterday. Nice one, douche bag! - Hey, pick that up. - Hey! Hey! - Come on! - You're dead. - All right, tough guy. You too. Thank you. There you go. I need you to sit down. - What are you looking at, huh? - Fuck... Get me out of this place, please. - I know it isn't easy, but taking that step towards reconciliation with the people most hurt by your addictions, that's the door to recovery. Okay, we're gonna keep working at this. This is mandatory policy now in all rehabilitation cent res. Each and every one of you will be participating. You're gonna be getting a day pass every day this week, so get out there and make good use of your time. Remember, don't rush, all right? Every step is a good one... - Okay, so, I have a proposition for you. - I don't think I want to hear this-- - I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them. Come on, I went through so much trouble. - Okay. - I don't know how to-- - Are you holding it? - Yeah, I'm holding it. - So you put it... - Hey, Charlotte. No, hey, Char- - I don't want to talk to you, Kyle. - Charlotte, come on, I'm-I'm still your brother. - No, I don't want to talk to him... - Well, well. If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni. If you and whatever drugs you're selling aren't off the school property in the next 30 seconds, I'm going to call the police. All third-floor staff to the nurses' station... - Hey, Dad. How you doing? - What do you want? - Are they-are they treating you all right? What the fuck do you want, you little prick? Huh? I told you I never wanted to see you again. You get out of my sight. Ten years because of you, you fuckin' dope fiend. You fuckin' coward! If I see you again, I will fucking kill you! If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you! I swear, I'll kill you! - Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures. Kyle? - Do I have to? - Please. I went to see my sister. - Okay, and how did that go? - Not very well. - Can you elaborate? - No. - Kyle- - He doesn't want to talk about it. - Talking is the only way to move forward. - Oh, fuck you and move forward! Fuck this whole place! None of this makes any fucking difference to us! - Fuck, I hate Bob. - He's a cock. - He's a fuckin' idiot. It's "make amends" day. Good to see you. Sorry about all that money I stole. - Yeah, sorry for ruining your life. Oh, wait a minute, you ruined my life. - It's all fucking bullshit anyways. - Speaking of which. - Sonia... There's a call for you. - My dad just died. ?? I wish that I had known ?? ?? In that first minute we met ?? ?? The unpayable debt ?? ?? That I owed you ?? ?? 'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you ?? ?? And you hired me to make up for that... ?? - Just after 11 :00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam. Authorities believe he died on impact, but crews are still dredging the reservoir to find his body. In Mission City... - Fuck... Let's go! 7:30, Halsted! - Nice one, loser! - It's weird. - What? 93, right? - Yeah, should be 93, but... 92. - Let's go. Good morning. - Nice one, douche bag! - All right, funny guy, clean it up. - What? - Right now. Right now. - Shit... - All of it. - Did you guys see that? - Fuck you, Bob. - Get back here. - Dick. - Hey... Get back here! - That was fucking weird. - Okay, so, I have a proposition for you. - I don't think I want to hear this proposition. - I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them. Come on, I went through so much trouble. - How did you steal this? - I took it from her purse like I take everything, okay? - I don't know how to-- - Okay, just hold it. - Okay, okay, I'm holding it. - Okay, right? - Yeah. - Now you have to put it to your lips like you're French. - Okay. - Okay. You'll never get that! - All third-floor staff to the nurses' station... - Pick up the fuckin' phone. What? Pick up the goddamn phone. I told you I never wanted to see you again! You get outta my sight! 10 years 'cause of you! You fuckin' dope fiend! You fuckin' coward! I see you again, I will fucking kill you! If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you! I swear, I'll kill you! - Well, well. If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni. If you and whatever drugs you're selling are not off the school property in the next 30 seconds, I'm calling the police. - Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures. Kyle? - Yeah? - What did you do today? - Uh... I went to see my sister. - And how did that go for you? - Not very well. - Can you elaborate on that, please? - No. - Halsted. Halsted. Kyle... Kyle... - What the fuck is going on? How is this even possible? I mean... Wait... The storm. Last night, the power went out, right? I was in the rec room and I-I touched the TV. I got this shock. That's the last thing I remember. - Same thing happened with me with my light. - Weeks? - Who cares how it happened? The real question is, what are we gonna do with it? - What were you doing last night? - What were you doing? - I was in the shower, okay? I got shocked, too. - Then what? - I don't remember. - Me neither. - The same thing happened to all of us. - Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again. - Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you. - Exactly the same. - You all right? - Shouldn't we be doing something? We just lived through the same day twice. Are we just gonna sit here and waste it? - Last night, on the news... There's-there's a jumper at the dam. Let's go. Let's do it. - What about curfew? - Fuck curfew. - Shit, we gotta stop him. - No, it's... It's too late. - Couldn't sleep. - Me neither. At least you went to see him. - I didn't. - I thought you went to the hospital. - I went to the hospital, but... I just couldn't go into his room. - What do you think'd happen if we just... Stayed in here all night? - Trouble for sure. - Then I'm not leaving. - Why do you think this is happening to us? - Sorry. - No, it's... It's okay. - 7:30, Halsted! - Bob! - What? - What day is it? Last time I checked, it was Wednesday. - Look, we're gonna figure this out. - We're not gonna figure out shit, okay? We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds. - Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right? So... - So, what? So maybe that's something that we do? - Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it. God, what is that girl's problem? You know, if you think about it, it doesn't really matter what we do today. Right? I mean, I could take a piss in group. As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob. Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened. - Yeah. I don't know, man. I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know? - What do you think we should do with it? - I don't know. - Pull it out and put it back. : What? - The bottle of gin. I can see it in your pants. Pull it out and put it back! - It's not in my pants. - What do you call that? Put it back! You know what, both of you, get the hell out of my store! Both of you, get out! Idiots! - Feeling better? - Oh, starting to. - What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Oh, no, dude. We'd better pray tomorrow repeats. Fuck! You're sick! Sick! Oh, Bobby... Whoa, Bob likes pussy. Who am I? Who am I? Bob... loves... lady cock. - What the fuck? - Oh, no... Nearly Legal. Nearly Legal. Fuck, look. Oh, fuck. - All right, freeze, boys! Party's over. Hands on your head. Let's go, right now. Hands on your head. That's it. Looks like you screwed up royally this time, eh, Weeks, huh? Just like the old man, huh? Hands behind your back. Halsted. Your mom posted bail. - See you this morning. - Well... Looks like no daddy coming for you, cowboy. - Breaking and entering? Vandalism? Your first day pass and that's what you do with it, huh? Well, you must be really proud of yourself. You have any idea what that little exercise just cost me? Kyle... - Just after 11:00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam-- - It's weird. I was scared, but... At the same time, I felt... really alive. - What if it doesn't repeat? You're gonna have a criminal record on top of your drug history. That's pretty awesome, Halsted. 7:30, Halsted! - Hey, Bob? Bob... I hear there's been a few break-ins in the neighbourhood lately? - What the hell are you talking about? - Nothing. - Okay, come on, let's go. Get your ass in gear. - Hello. - Well, hello. Again. - Every time. - Let's go. - Bob, look in' slick. : Morning. : Nice one, douche bag. So, what's on the program? - Clean it up. Right now. - You know, I think our man, Bob, on his down time, he likes to just settle in with a little bit of Victoria gin. - Victoria gin? - Yeah, yeah, a little bit of lubrication before he kicks off his shoes, and he thumbs through his favorite magazine... Nearly Legal! Right, Bob? - I knew he was a pig. - Oh, not to worry, Logan. I think you're a bit too old for him now. - Fuck you. - Well, fuck it, cowpokes, let's celebrate! - Yeah. Yeah! - Three more! Here! Baby, baby, baby, baby... - Woo! - Are you gonna be able to pay for all this? - Oh, you bet your sweet ass, girl. - All right, yeah, I'm gonna need you to settle up. - I apologize. He hasn't gotten laid in a bit. - A very long time. You want to help me out with that? - Oh... - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That there male and that there female are gonna pay for me. - I have no money. - Fuck sakes... - I'm so sorry! - Okay, thanks, partner, that was great! All right, uh, I'm gonna sing a little song to pay for some drinks. - Woo! - Yeah, that's right, pal! And I'm gonna dedicate it to my two friends. Y'all know who you are- - It's us! We're his friends! Oh, my darlin' oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine - Let him sing! Hey, let him sing! Oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine... - Where did you get this from? - What was that noise? And? - Oh, that is-- Mine stinks, dude. - Milady? - Oh, shit. Wow. - My friend. One for you. - Oh, my G-- Are we really gonna do this? - Tell me you haven't always wanted to knock off a liquor store? - Are these things clean? - What? - Well, they jam if they're dirty, right? : We're not going to shoot anybody. Okay, you know what, the only thing that my old man cares about more than his knife collection is his fucking gun collection. So yeah, they're clean. Let's do this, kiddies! Oink! Oink! Stick your hands up! It's a stick-up! Let's go! - Try to touch my dick and I'll blow your fuckin' brains out! Go! - Shit... - Open the fuckin' register! - Okay. - You think this is fuckin' funny? Hurry up! Get me a bag, fuck! Quick! Here... - What the fuck? - Shit, there's a car! - What? - There's a car, fuck! Hurry up! - Let's go! - Hurry! - Let's go, come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Oh, my God, what the fuck? - How much did we get? - I don't know, man. There's like 500 bucks here and 42 pennies. I took it all, man. I took it all. Shit... - Yo, Tiko, what's up, man? - Well, if it isn't my favourite customer, man. Long time, no show, bro. - Yeah, man. Look, um... Michelle? Charlotte? Tiko, what the fuck, man? Tell me you didn't get my sister fuckin' high. - That's not all we did, G. - Hey... - Charlotte! - Easy! Fuck... Jesus... We good? Nobody in there wants to talk to you. Okay, man? So just fuck off. - Fuck you. - Really? - Yeah. - There's room for you. - Nice fuckin' sweatpants. - Don't worry, guys. I know a guy that we can score from. Welcome to my drug of choice, kiddies. - This shit always fuckin' scared me. - They say you're addicted the moment you take your first hit. Only today... You get to be unaddicted again. Here it comes. Here it comes... Go, go, go, go, go. ?? ...ain't gonna cure you ?? ?? Honey time's just gonna hit on you ?? ?? You got to ?? ?? You got to go steal ahead ?? ??

We were just having some fun, man. I didn't-I didn't- - Shut the fuck up! - Okay, okay, okay... : Come on, man. - Pick that up. What? - Pick that up. - No, man. Fuck you, man! - Pick that up, you fuck! - Fuck... I didn't touch your fucking sister, man! - Pick it fucking up! - Don't make me fucking do this, man. Don't make me do it, man... - Fuck. Don't fucking cry, just fuckin' pick it up. : No... - Mm-h mm. Now take a bite. Take a bite, Tiko... Fuck you, man! I didn't touch your fucking sister, man! You're all going to fucking jail! Fuck you! - All right, kiddies, let's go. - It's okay. Woo! - Time to up the ante! If you slip? Bang! Wake up in bed like it's a bad dream. - Yeah, that's assuming we have another repeat. - Hmm, if we don't... Make sure they bury me with my boots on. - Jesus... - Hey, Mike, come on, man. - Shh... Kyle... You're gonna mess up my concentration. Ah... Who's next? Huh? - Hey... - What? - What are you doing? You're ripped out of your mind. We still don't even know if we're gonna repeat. We can't fuck around like this. - I'm okay. It's okay. - Oh, who is this girl? There you go, girl. Rip that pole. Oh, one foot, one foot- - Fuck off, Weeks! - Woo! I saw a smile! - Stop it! - I won't say another word-- No! - Don't let go! Weeks! Weeks, help me! No! - You're fuckin' dead! You're fucking dead, you fuck! Fuck you! - See you this morning! - Fuck you! You're fucking dead! 7:30, Halsted. - You should get some hash browns before they're all gone. Nice one, loser! - Never realized how much I loved the hash browns. - Jesus... - Yeah. Only it took him three days to rise from the dead. - Good morning. - Okay, you died last night. I saw you die. - What was it like? Do you... remember anything? - I just remember right before, and then... It's blank. You know, I've thought about suicide before, but... I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened, I... Can't believe how bad I wanted to live. - We have to stop. Right now. - What? - If today hadn't repeated-- - But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating. - Yeah, w-we're tempting fate. - We just gotta figure something out, okay? We gotta get out of this somehow. - You've got to be fucking kidding me. This is a fucking gift. We can do anything we want, anything. It's your fuckin' loss. - Don't you think it's kind of weird that all this stuff happens on the same day your dad dies? - My dad used to force himself on me. And a-at first, I-I didn't know what to do. I mean, I... I didn't even know what he was doing. And as I got older, I would fight back, but... Never seemed to stop it. So, I mean, I-I don't know what... What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that? - Here we go. No! - No, no, no! Don't! Don't! No! - Fuck off! - No! - You don't want to do this! - Who are you? - You don't want to do this. Look at me. - Let go of me! - You don't want to do this. - Please let me go, please let me go. : Please... It's okay... : Please let me go... - The news said it was a man, but... It was a girl. Just a girl. - I know, she's, like, the same age as me. - Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing. You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people. - She's still going to be there again tomorrow. - He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I... - Okay, we'll get you another jacket. - Copy that. We'll bring her in for an assessment. Get all the necessary tests. - What's going on? - A girl got attacked. - I need a description. - I don't know what he looked like! - Do you know who did this to you? - Don't touch me! - Can you give me a description? - It was him. - What? - It was him! - Hey, hey! - Just let me go... Don't touch me, okay? - What the hell is the matter with you Kyle, huh? - Kyle! Stop! Stop it! - What the fuck? - You raped her! You fucking raped her! - I don't know what you're fucking talking about! - Don't fucking lie to me! You raped a 15-year-old girl! - Okay, first of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it. - You fucking raped her! - Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle! - It doesn't make it okay. - So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh? Is that okay? What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit? You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle! Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act? I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay? And you two better stay the fuck out of my way. - Why is this happening to us? 7:30, Halsted! - Bob! - What do you want, Halsted? - It's Wednesday, right? - Last time I checked, yeah. - Nice one, loser! - I can't believe that Charlotte was hanging out with Tiko. No, I... I just never thought that she was- - She was what? Like you? - I don't know. - Okay, so, I have a proposition for you. - I don't think I want to hear this proposition. - I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them. Come on, I went through so much trouble. - How did you steal this? - I took them from her purse like I take everything. - Hey, Charlotte... Hey, uh... Look, do you want to, uh... just, um- - I don't want to talk to you. - Charlotte! Hey... Hi. I'm Sonia. Um... Look, I know you think your brother's an asshole, and you're probably right, but... It's just, if you would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay? Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him... Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food. Why don't you guys come? - Okay. - Okay. We can fit in the truck, right? - Uh, yeah. Yeah. - Come in. What colour? - Blonde. - You're gonna go blond e? - Yeah. - No... Did not know. I mean, I love the blond e, but your hair... I mean, it goes so well with your eyes. It's pretty. - Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so... - Should be fun. - Oh, ho, ho! Well, well, well... If this just isn't too cute for prime time. You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeaky little lives? - Put it away, Weeks. - What, it's okay for you to smoke meth, but it's off limits for the rest of the family, is that it? If it isn't the friendly neighborhood dick! - Say that again, Weeks. - How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways? - Just keep talking. Come on, Weeks, keep talking. All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny. Look, you want to think very carefully about what you're doing right now. - Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking. I'm all thunk out. - Mike-- - Shut the fuck up, Kyle. I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here. One... Hand away from the gun, Gerald. Hand away from the gun. There you go, there you go. Two... Fucking mess with me! Yeah, no daddy coming for you! Fuck off! You don't know what you're missing. - You guys okay? Hey... You okay? Charlotte, you okay? You all right? You okay? 7:30, Halsted! - What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? - Hey, everything that you're doing is gonna stay with you! It's gonna stay with all of us! - No, Kyle! You do not want to do this, Kyle! : Kyle! - You have to do this. - It's not gonna make any difference. Nothing does. - You have to try. You know, it's amazing... The things I could justify just to score, you know? Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sister's ATM card... siphon off some cash here and there. What's a kid need with all that money, right? Then they... They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed. And... Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind. - I couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time. - Come on, Mike... You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day. Me and Sonia are worried about you, man. - Oh, you are, huh? The two of you, the thoughtful couple. How nice. God, she finally got to you, huh? Did she feed you the line... What was it? Uh... "I couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?" It's right before she grabs your cock, right? How was she for you? You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself. The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here. Where'd you do it? You didn't do it, did you? What's the matter, buddy?! - Look! Mike! Just... stop, okay? Stop. Let's just forget about this, okay? Let's just forget about all this shit... And just try again. Let's try to figure this out. There's got to be some kind of deeper meaning... to this. - I... I just took a piss in my pants. There's got to be some deeper meaning in that, don't you think? See, look? I'll see you this morning! - Are you tipsy yet? - Maybe. Aren't you supposed to be locked up somewhere? - Charlotte, I need to talk to you. - I don't want to talk to you. - Charlotte... - Fuck off. - I just thought if I could talk to her... If I could explain... Maybe there's just no point in me trying to explain the shit I did. - Kyle, she'll come around. - I don't know. Are you, uh... Are you okay about earlier? - Yeah. I'm very okay. Doesn't a part of you wonder if maybe he's right? I mean, if every good thing we do gets erased... Every bad thing we do gets erased... What does it really matter what we do? - I guess... I just need for it to matter. 7:30 Halsted! Nice one, loser! - Hey... Bob, where's Mike? - What? - Sonia? You know where they are? I don't know, Halsted, having a smoke? I don't know. - Drop the club. Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club. Drop it. You think you can decide how I spend my repeats? It's only fair that I return the favour. Take the knife. The knife on the table, take it. - What? - Come on, Kyle. Good. Stand over there. - Mike, what- - Now... Cut his throat. - Mike, please don't do this. - Cut his throat, or I'll put a bullet in her leg. I kid you not, Kyle. I will put a hole in her leg the size of a fucking grapefruit. Do it, or I'll put a bullet in her head! - You're fucked! - That's right, get angry! Get motherfucking feral! Cut his fucking throat! Welcome to the club, Kyle. - You're okay... Come on, come on. All right... - We'll have fun... - I'm okay. Come on, what's wrong? Come on... - No, I'm okay. I'm okay. - Fuck! - Get the fuck up! Get up, you fucking piece of shit. - I knew you had it in you. I'm gonna give you three seconds to get lost. - Fuck you. See you this morning, Kyle. 7:30, Halsted! - Do you want me to come up? - No. I'm fine. - You're gonna die tonight. Don't ask me how I know, but it's true. I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times. I don't hate you anymore. I don't, but I have to move on from this. I have to, or else no thing's gonna change... For any of us. - What do you want? Are you in trouble? - No, I... They let us out for a few hours. Can I-can I come in? I really need to talk to Charlotte. - I-I really don't think it's a good idea. - Mom, I really need to talk to her. - Are you clean? - Yeah, Mom. Please let me talk to her. - Okay. - Residents are reeling tonight over the death of two local police officers in what's shaping up to be a double homicide. The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s... - Charlotte? - What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. - Get the fuck out of my room. - No. Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay? - We've got nothing to talk about. Who's in the car? One of your addict friends? - Her name's Sonia. Yeah, I met her in rehab. I've been thinking a lot lately... Just about... About what I did to you and to Mom. - I don't want to hear this, Kyle. - And I can't let another day pass without telling you... Without telling you how sorry I am. - Fine. Are we through now? - Thing is, Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and- - You think I'm a fuck-up like you? - No... No, that's not what I meant. - You don't have to watch over me. - But I... I do. Charlotte... Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters. And I know you probably don't care right now, but... But from now on, I'm going to be there for you. I'll be there for you when it counts, because... I love you. And... And I'm gonna be your big brother. 7:30, Halsted! - Sonia! - Kyle? - Drop it. Drop it. Good. Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun. So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a twist. If I find you... I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you. You've got one minute. One minute. - You okay? - Other door. One... - Come on! - ...two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... Come on, come on... - One minute! - There! There! This way! Yeah! Woo! - Come on. Come on... - Come on out, kiddies, I ain't got all day. Come on out! - Come on. Come on! Come on... Come on, come on... Go! Come on! Go! - Are you guys having fun yet? You know, the last rehab place I went to... They had us act out horrible events from our past. What do you say, Logan? You could be nine years old again. I could play daddy! Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you! What the fuck are you doing? - Go. Go! Go! - Hey... Hey, kid! Hey, you all right? - It doesn't snow today. What day is it? I said, what day is it?! Oh, fuck... - How are you doing? - I'm fine. I just got a tetanus shot and some stitches. Where is he? - No one's seen him. - We need you to come with us. - Get your fucking head down on the floor! If you two fucking move, I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me? I'll fucking kill you. I will fucking kill you. - Mom? I'm sorry. - Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan. - So I understand you've been brought up to speed? - Yeah. - Most important thing is you keep him calm. Gimme the phone, come on.
