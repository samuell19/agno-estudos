THE NEW TESTAMENT - I love you. - I adore you. Your husband! Well, well... - Did Sir speak? - No. - Did he see us? - Definitely not. We did this. Take me home quickly. - Robert! - Sir? - Drive me to the Bois de Boulogne. - Very good, Sir. - We're dining at your place. - I'll call. - Robert. - Sir? - Stop at a tobacconist's. - Very good, Sir. Stop here. Here, stop on the right. - There must be a phone. - Yes, Sir. Good bye. - Good evening, Sir. - Good evening. Tell me... Emile? - Emile? - Sir? - Your name? - Theophile. Emile was the butler before you. The first few days it's hard. If I say "marquis", don't be offended. - You were... - With a marquis, Doctor. The Marquis de la Margelle, who had a hard time. - You said... Theophile? - Yes, Sir. - I don't like it. - Me neither. - Any others? - My real name is Jean. Impossible. We have the same first name. That's why I didn't propose it. I'm really unlucky. It's my 16th name change. - Yes... - Does... - What? - Does Sir like Gaston? - Who? - The name. No. It was my father's. There's family, close friends... - We'll be fine with Theophile. - Indeed. May Sir find one that he likes. Thank you. Sir has an Andre in the family? No. Not yet. - Andre, then. - All right. But at first I may not answer right away. - I'll ring for you. - Yes. - Are you happy with me? - Yes, very. Why? I'm very happy with Sir and Madam. Sir might well laugh. - Good masters are hard to find. - No doubt. And there are usually two masters. A servant has but one character. We must accustom ourselves to two different characters, sometimes opposite, which demands flexibility. - 5.20. - So I see. I asked you whether you were satisfied as I can feel myself becoming attached. - Does Sir understand? - Very well. - No remarks? - No. - I'll ask Madam, then. - Do. - Do I call you "Doctor"? - No. - As Sir is a doctor... - No. - Only if I'm ill. - That's right. - Goodbye. - Yes. - Are you leaving? - For the office. You can't say goodbye each time you leave and hello each time you come back! Tell me when Madam returns. Madam has returned. - She has? - Yes. - You're sure? - Certain. - Then make us some tea. - Very well. - I'll call for it. - Very well. I can never do as I wish. Be happy, Miss. I obtained a place for you to teach English at high school. It's settled. - I cannot hide my joy. - Good. I must leave my benefactor. A vacancy has arisen following a death. - It's God's will. - Indeed. Just report to Rue de Grenelle tomorrow. Ask for Mr Favory. He's expecting you. Do come back to train your replacement. She's been selected? Yes, as you're leaving Paris tomorrow at the latest. Have I left you in an awkward situation? I think I've done very well. Think just of your joy at seeing your mother, down there. - How old is she? - My mother is 67. I can understand your wanting to live with her. - You have no children... - Just imagination. - I have no appointments? - No, Sir. - See you tomorrow, then. - Thank you, Sir. I can see a shadow in your eyes. You would like to teach English? - No. - I could see... - No matter. - Your mother lives in Roubaix... Daughter, not mother. And it's Tourcoing. I wanted a job as a nurse at the hospital. But no matter. Roubaix is 15 minutes from Tourcoing... - You speak English? - No. German. That's good. I'll learn English. Thank you. My God, the wretch! You try to please... Let's not bother about that. I can't do it like that. I'll do it later at the... the Circle. When it's quiet. It's not that urgent. Oh... Andre! Sir? - What would you like? - Tea. - It's ready. - Then bring it. - Ask Madam if she wants any. - Very good, Sir. - Here's the tea. - Thank you. - Madam is coming. - Perfect. Theophile told me you were home. - No. - No? - No. It's Andre. - Andre? - He's called Andre now. - Impossible! - Oh? - That was Daddy's name. Call him Theophile. I'll call him Andre. People will think we have two servants. - Two sugars? - You know that. Why ask? - We rarely take tea together. - I've nobody today. - Let's enjoy it. - Yes. - You're not going out? - I've just come in. Your hair looks like someone who's going out. Yes. I will be going out. I forgot two errands. Another thing: Miss Morot is leaving. She's been appointed German or English teacher in Tourcoing or Roubaix. - Just like that? - Yes. After you were so kind to her! There's no gratitude from some people... Some people are reliable, though. But we don't usually need them. It must be awful for you. It was such trouble finding someone. - You managed? - Thanks to Bergeron, who sacrificed someone first-rate. I'm waiting now. - For Bergeron? - For the person. Young, well-mannered, deserving and physically pleasing. That's very nice. Aesthetically, Miss Morot... - One doesn't watch one's secretary. - But one sees her. And one shows her. She's delicious, he said. A redhead. - Redhead? - Why the grimace? - A redheaded secretary... - You'll see. You put in too much sugar. Please add some tea. - It's undrinkable like this. - No doubt. You'll get upset. I've never felt more in control. Thank you. You see, Lucie, life is short. - Why do you say that? - I must have heard it. But these are things you should repeat. Yes, life is short. Every four years, you must change both your staff and your entourage. - Entourage? - I could go further. The spectacle of youth is as necessary to us as vitamins. - Is it not? - Indeed. So first, rejuvenate the staff. We started with the dismissal of old Emile. He thought he was methodical, because he worked slowly. He did nothing. We'd always think: "We'll miss him." But no. Let's remember one thing: in life, no one is indispensable to anyone else. Show that damn cook the door. - Augustine? - Right away. - Why? - For a change. No! You're joking. She must have done something new. She never does anything new. All we eat is sole though there are 1,400 varieties of fish. She does it very well. There are things I love that she doesn't do. I'm deprived. It's quite simple. "No more deprivation!" That'll be my motto. This is a revolution. In fact, I'm changing the cook. Don't you fancy joining the revolution? - Me? - Yes, you, Lucie Marcelin. We can be frank, after 20 years of living together. Aren't there times you'd like to change men? - Why ask me that? - Why not? I wonder too. I'm not making you a proposal. I'm asking you a question. Examine our existence. Don't examine it like that. As if it was others' existence. You're intelligent. Give me a good reason why we both carry on living together. Look at it reasonably. We say hello in the morning but I usually lunch out. We never take tea together. At night, we have friends for dinner. - As for the rest... - What? Not bad. Nothing extraordinary, judging by the headaches we have when it's time for good-nights. That's why I asked, out of curiosity, given that we only live once, to give me one good reason why we still live together. - Look, Jean... - Carry on, my child. But let's carry on pleasantly, won't you? - But... - Won't you? Yes. - Yes? - Yes. From now on, we'll be nice to each other. If we're smart about it, we can manage well like that. Maybe it works so well because we don't see each other. Aren't the Worms coming to dinner tomorrow? - I think so. - I'll confirm it. - Yes, tomorrow. - Why? I tend to forget the Worms. - Oh! - Yes, it's very odd. I hope you're not cleaning them out too? - Are you joking? - Why? It'd be a crime, and you know it. Here are people who love you. It's wonderful. What haven't I done for that man! He won't forget it. He's a good doctor and a fine upstanding man. - No. - No? No. He's an ordinary radiographer. He's a fairly good man. Everyone needs a good friend like that. - They're nice to be around. - Oh, yes. He's always in a good mood and she's gorgeous. - Their son is charming. - Intelligent. - Oh? - Very. He's a maturing boy. - Maturing? - What? He's coming along... I understand very well. He's maturing now, so as to ripen. Business bores him. I had a chance to chat to him after dinner. - You didn't notice? - No. - He astonished me. - Good. I think he's a good-looking boy. - Fernand? - He's a good-looking boy. You find him handsome? - Don't you? - Oh, no. - You're hard. - No. First... his eyes are slanting and his mouth is small. I haven't observed all those details. Overall he's good. - No accounting for taste. - Good. Get him to talk and you'll have a nice surprise. - He's clean, upright... - I saw him born. It's just because you saw him born - that you don't know him. - Perhaps. - I'm sure... - I'm here. You'd have a better idea of his qualities if you intimidated him less. - I intimidate him? - Mortally. You call him "tu" and he calls you "vous". - You're right. - That stiffens relations. I'll have a quiet word with him tomorrow. As you wish. But what I told you... - I keep to myself. - Yes. - Come, now. - You know as well as I do, - never swear. - Don't mess around with love. - Why? - I don't know. I also wanted to quote a play by Musset. - What was I saying? - We were talking about the boy. That's right. You who were talking so appositely earlier about ingratitude... You could rely on him. - What for? - It's always good to know. - I've no advice for you. - Give me some. - I'm very conciliatory. - Maybe you didn't think of that. - Miss Morot is going. Try it. - No. - You can always see if... - No! - Oh. - No. I'll tell you why. - I prefer a woman. - Amusing. - It's very funny. - Yes... Miss Lecourtois. - Who? - From Mr Bergeron. I should think so. Show her in. No more deprivation. - Shall I leave you? - Not the first day. She's not a redhead. Come in, Miss. - Hello. - Hello. I'll introduce you. I didn't catch your name... - Miss? - Lecourtois. Miss Lecourtois, Mrs Marcelin, my wife. - Miss. - You're not red-headed! No. - You know what's going on? - No, Sir. My secretary has left... Yes. I know that. - He's given you to me. - Yes, Sir. That doesn't bother you? - No. - Good. - You're a medical student? - Yes. - What year? - Third year. Already? Truth be told, I need a secretary, not a nurse. - I also have a law degree. - I wasn't that demanding. You must know medical terms and shorthand. - I do. - My compliments! What an education you're receiving! - What did you say? - Nothing. I thought you spoke. Do you intend practicing later? - If you so advise. - Good. - Hard-working? - Yes. - Punctual? Organized? - Yes. - Discreet? - Yes. What else? - You live with your family? - We don't care. - We can ask her... - No. I'm obliged to ask you... - How much would you like? - That's up to you. - The same as Miss Morot. - Let me speak. Does 3,000 francs a month...? - What? - You gave Miss Morot less. I paid her rent. - It amounts to the same. - Oh? Just discussing dinner. - Is 3,000 francs a month OK? - Certainly, Sir. No. Don't go. Could you begin right away? - Ready and willing. - Good. Would you get something to write with? - Your desk is over there. - Very good, Sir. - You don't waste time! - I've no time to waste. - What do you think? - Young... - Yes. But in general? - She's female. - What's your impression? - Same as yours: excellent. I think she's a seer. Seer... Will she predict the future? Come in, Miss. Please take a letter. To Dr Guillaumet, 23, Avenue Henri Martin, Paris. My dear colleague... - I can leave. - No. Stay there, quietly. I saw your client, Mrs D... Stop me if I go too fast. - Not at all. - Thank you. Hers is not a pathological case, they're phenomena that are due to her age and fear of showing it. It's a critical age for women. The most docile amongst them experience an upheaval, but those ahead of the game fall prey to their passions. Like your client. I can't help with Chetel-Guyon. I cannot advise her husband, who has not consulted me, to go to Contrexeville nor her to go to Chetel-Guyon. My dear colleague, your client is behaving badly and wants to stop her husband doing likewise, which is inhuman. - Excuse me. - Don't mention it. I look forward to your reply. Yours sincerely... - Madam is going out? - No. Very good. Hello? Hello? Is that you, Fernand? Yes. Tell me... Did he see us yesterday? No? Are you sure? You said he did what? He thought he saw us? But tomorrow's dinner is still on. I'll be there at 7.45 and we can talk about it. I love you. See you tomorrow. May I ask if Madam is satisfied with me? Yes, indeed. Very. - No remarks? - None. Yes. Just one small thing. Don't announce the names of wines so loudly. Oh... Right. Can I, in turn, ask Madam for a little something? Do ask. Don't ring three times like you do now. Ding, ding, ding. I get the feeling Madam is in a bad mood. Madam can ring just once and I'll come. Unless Madam likes going ding, ding, ding... No. I'll ding. Thank you, madam. I prepared Sir's dinner jacket... He won't have time to put it on. - Time? - 7.45 pm. Dinner is at 8. See you later. See you later, Madam, and cheers. - Still here? - I'm waiting for Mr Marcelin. He won't be doing anything this evening. We have people for dinner. Don't wait any longer. - He hasn't signed his mail. - I'll have him sign it. - See you tomorrow, Miss. - He asked me to wait. I'll tell him I sent you away. He won't be satisfied. You don't think you're indispensable already? I'm just obeying an order I received. If you're that obedient, then go! I don't take orders from you. Your insistence in staying... Is less rude than your insistence in throwing me out. You have spoken to me three times and each time with unjustified suspicion. You believe it unjustified. - What do you reproach? - Lots of things. The insolence in your eyes, your manners, your provocative gait... - Provocative? - Embarrassing. And out of place in our milieu. Mr Marcelin must have noticed this. - Why do you say that? - He remarked on you. - Remarked? - Yes. Your zeal is a waste of time tonight. Try to place yourself with a bachelor. That way you'll be fine. If you don't understand, just look at yourself, Miss. Looking at you, it's far more understandable. Any provocation I have I read in your eyes yesterday. That look that swept over me... - It was the enemy entering. - The enemy... You do exaggerate! You look just like a girl. We cannot all look like mothers. Mr Marcelin didn't talk about me last night. You talked to him about me. You told him I probably had tuberculosis. No. I'm neither tuberculous nor provocative. What I have is more serious. I am 22, Madam, and alas, that isn't catching. The little strumpet! Seeing her hanging around him, at her age... No! Mr Fernand Worms. Yes. No, none of that here. - Good evening. - I love you. - Watch out! - Is he back? - No. - Well? You must be careful. Wait. She's gone now. - Who? - Nobody. - I met a gorgeous girl. - She's not gorgeous. You didn't see her properly. She has the forehead of a dope. - In the shadows... - You'll see. - When? - Never. Sit down and listen to me. Yesterday, when I came in here, we had a long conversation about you. - Started by him? - No. - Just like that. But I carried on. - Why did you do that? To see if he suspects. - And does he? - We'll see. - How? - Well... After dinner, chat to him alone. Put yourself forward. You understand? Not very well. Why would I do that? I want him to take you on as a secretary. The chance has come up. - Listen. - Yes, darling. - He suspects... - I fear so. - You think he saw us... - In fact, he didn't see us. - No? - He'd have told me otherwise. He thought he saw us. My strength lies in knowing that. I'm sure I saw him. He thinks he saw me. Yes... If I can allay this suspicion, I kill two birds with one stone. We're saved, and I'm saved too. Give him the impression you're an honest man, a loyal man. You see? And... - If I get flustered? - I've planned it all. I told him he intimidated you. Don't be surprised if he asks to call you "tu". I told him that must intimidate you. The more intelligent men are, the less clever they are. He wants youth around him, well he's going to get it! What interests me is tomorrow. We haven't seen each other. - I was taken all day. - Not by me. Tomorrow at 3 by the statue of Joan of Arc. OK. - I adore you. - Is that true? You say so and you show me so. But you don't explain. Why do you love me, darling? - Do you know? - I never wondered. When I say I love you, it's because of your eyes. - What's up with my eyes? - They look so... - What? - I can't. I want to know why you love me so, despite... - Despite? - The fact I'm no longer 20. Despite? But that's why I like you. Nothing astonishes girls of 20. Mature women don't expect anything. Oh! Be quiet. That's awful. It's a terrible thing to say. The door! Oh! Hello... - Good evening. - Good evening. - Are you well? - Yes. And you? What a lovely dress! You're here already? - Hello, Daddy. - Hello. When he's not late, he has to be early! - Hello. - Hello. I'm not early, you're late. - What? - Dinner's at 8. It's 7 minutes past. - 8.07? - Precisely. - But Jean isn't here! - Maybe he is. No. I'd know. Theophile! Madam? - Is Sir here? - No. Thank you. - That's strange. - Why? - What time did he go out? - Around 5, after surgery. - Why? - I don't know. - He must note his appointments. - On his calendar. Let's look. - Is that it? - That's it. - Today's the 24th? - Yes. The 24th... He had five visits to make, so... 5, Mrs Petrin. 5.30, the Marquis... - 6, Pelle... - Pellegrini. That's his tailor. 6.30, Mrs Derby James, and 7, the Bey of Tunis. - He won't be back before 9. - Why? Did you just marry Jean this morning? Does he sometimes come home later than planned? Yes. You're totally right. I'm being ridiculous. But a doctor isn't his own master. He may plan just to stay for quarter of an hour... - It depends on the patient. - Yes. - And sudden death cases... - No. - What? - It doesn't matter. - What's wrong? - People die just like that. It just gets recorded. You do this with your head... say something kind, and then go. An experienced man can do a death in five minutes. The worst is when the patient says, "Stay. I don't feel well." Patients never check the time. They don't care about you. Sometimes it's deliberate. Oh! Patients are selfish, so being 15 minutes late... You are totally right. I'm nervous, you know how it is. Calm down now. It's all over. What's wrong? - It's nothing, Madam. - But what was it? It was the boiler. Oh! - Ah! - That won't be him. He rings until it's opened. Who is it, then? Go and open it! Oh, sorry. - Something must have happened. - No. Doctor Marcelin! - It's a man! - And? - Let's see... - Why doesn't he say what it is? - Here he is. - Well? This is Sir's jacket. - What jacket? - This one. Wasn't that the one he had on? Yes, Madam. - Who brought it? - I don't know. - You didn't open the door? - Yes, Madam. - Did you see the man? - Yes. - And...? - I'd never seen him before. - What was he like? - He reminded me of Hugo. - What? - Like Victor Hugo. An old man with a beard. - Didn't you ask him? - Ask him what? - What did he say? - He asked for Dr Marcelin. - Then he left. - Is that all? - It didn't seem extraordinary. - Oh! - Run! - He's a long way off. - Try the stairs. - It's the ground floor. - That's true. - Run! - My friends... - Don't worry. - Something bad's happened. - Why? - Because... - What? I have a premonition. - Well? - I couldn't catch him. What's happened to him? He may have left his jacket at someone's house. Whose? Come along now, that's just silly. - He may have lost it. - Lost it! - You don't lose a jacket. - In a taxi... - There's no reason... - I was just saying. - That's just silly! - Excuse me, Madam. - It's much more serious. - Keep cool. - I'd like to see you do the same. - Maybe it was stolen. - Don't be silly. - No. Yes. - Look in the pockets. - That's intelligent. Thank you, Daddy. - Find anything? - His wallet. - You see! - Is it empty? No. There's 4,000 francs in it. - You see... - So it wasn't stolen. - And in the other pockets? - His hanky's in this one. There's nothing in this one. - And here there's a toothpick. - And the last? - My God! - What is it? - A sealed envelope. - What? - With wax. - Give me that. No! "This is my will and testament." - We need vinegar. - Where can we find some? - In the kitchen! - That's true. Slap her hands. Come round, Lucie. - Come back to us. - Lucie! - Here's the vinegar. - Quick! - I don't like vinegar. - She doesn't like it. - He's drowned. - No! My head can't be wrong. He killed himself because he was sad. - Sad? - Yes. - He wasn't sad. - I know what I'm saying. - I remember what he said. - What? Odd things that now seem quite clear. Such as? - Like, "Life is short." - Lucie! "No one is indispensable." It was the way he said them that was so singular. He wanted to have tea with me yesterday, something he hadn't done for three years. - Yes... - I don't understand that. It's... - Nothing. - Are you better? - Yes, Marguerite. - My poor Lucie! Be brave. - What shall we do? - Open it. - You've no right. - What? - Read it. - "This is my will." Then... "Only my notary is permitted to read this." - You see! - You imagine I'm going to wait? If he isn't dead, if he's just wounded, maybe I'll save him. - That's right. - We must know what he's done. If he threw himself in the Seine... Maybe he's been fished out. That's what he must have done. He took off his jacket and...! - No! - Come, let's be brave. I swear to you I am. He isn't dead. I'd know if he were dead. My head cannot be wrong. "This is my will." "My dear master and friend..." - Such calm writing! - Could be old. - Who? - His will. - There's no date. - Yes, at the end... - At the end? Where? - Here. - It's today's date! - Oh! "My dear master and friend..." - I can't bear it. - Him neither. He killed himself. It's me who can't bear it. Read, my friend. "My dear master and friend," "when you read this, I shall be dead." - Ah, Marguerite! - That's normal. Yes. It's true. "These are my final wishes. This will voids all preceding ones." "Other than the works of art that belong to me..." All his little things... "...which will go to my wife..." - No! - Come now, Lucie. "Want my fortune to be divided into 3 equal parts." - Three? - Yes. "The first is for my wife." And the second? "The second for Madeleine Lecourtois, 77, boulevard Raspail." What? "The second for Madeleine Lecourtois," "and the third for Juliette Lecourtois, same address." - What? - Yes... Who are those women? "One of whom..." - Give it here! - No. Read it, Worms! I want to know. Come on, hurry. "One of whom is my daughter." - His daughter? - Yes. - And the other? - No. Don't stop! I want to know everything now as I surely will need to soon. Come on. It's a consolation. Read on. - "One is..." - His daughter. And the other? - "The other is my mistress." - Your mistress? - What? - Not my mistress, his! - Oh, right! - "Oh, right"? He had a mistress and a daughter. It's her! - Who? - His secretary! - Miss Morot? - No. He replaced her two days ago with a tall brunette, who won't be staying. I was struck by her name. "Lecourtois", that's it. Introducing his mistress to the family home! His mistress? It may be his daughter. - No. - Yes, perhaps it's his daughter. I was struck by the name. "Lecourtois". They're both called Lecourtois. - Both of them? - Yes. Listen. I don't understand. "The second part..." "goes to Madeleine Lecourtois..." - Bd Pasteur. - Raspail. - Same thing. - Yes. "The third is for Juliette Lecourtois, same address." "One is my daughter, the other my mistress." - He doesn't say which. - No. Yes... Search his wallet. Maybe he has a photo. Yes, he's right. There's nothing at all in here. - No secret pockets? - Yes, here on the side. I can feel something. Two photos. It must be them. There she is! The other is a 3-year-old girl. Who looks like him! So I was right. I'd never considered them having a daughter. It's frightful. Why did he want to bring her here? Who knows what goes on with such a man... - Maybe he explains later. - Read, my dear. "These three shares would not have been equal" "if I hadn't found out by chance of the misconduct..." - Oh! - He knew! Yes. We are quits. That's the explanation. It was revenge. Ah... Cruel revenge. Do carry on. "After 17 years of marriage, Lucie was unfaithful "in a rather racy way. - "She is the mistress of..." - Stop! Too late! I saw his name. - Out, my child! - I was going. Oh! Oh! Forgive me. I was forgetting he was your son. With Fernand! The little wretch! I can't bear this. - You read it, Marguerite. - Oh no, Lucie. - You know everything. Read. - Oh, my God! We must know what he did. "It's exciting to know that the son, unknowingly, avenged..." Marguerite! Come here, my friend! Come, my friend. Marguerite! Don't read it! No, Adrien! - Oh, my God! - Don't read it? "It's exciting to know that the son, unknowingly," "avenged his father's honor." - How? - I don't know. "I wish that from the money I possess in my current account," "100,000 francs be given to Adrien as, 25 years ago," "his wife was..." Good God! - It says that? - No. That's me. - My friend... - Wretch! Adrien! Death erases all, but... - Think of me. - I can explain. Explain nothing here. At home... It's him. Give me that! - The jacket! - Say nothing to him. - Not a word! - Yes. Excuse me! I'm sorry I'm late. Good evening. I went try on a new suit this afternoon and left with the new jacket! After an hour or so, I noticed. The tailor was shut. They eventually opened up but found nothing. I had a little money in it, but more bothersome was my... - What? - The communication from Besangon. What's that? They're making fun! It's shameful! - What? - A gentleman brought it. Excuse my not wearing a dinner jacket. No, thank you. It's hard alone but with two it's impossible. I'm glad to be home and to find... What's wrong? There's no note. Has anyone touched my jacket? - No one, darling. - Who would do such a thing? The paper might have slipped out. - Perhaps. - That's awful. Jesus Christ! What's his name? Servant! The man who brought my coat, did he wrap it in something? - No. He had it over his arm. - What a fool! - You are upset. - It's not your fault. - Madam, dinner is served. - Dinner! Let's go. Go through, Madeleine. After you. - Did anyone search my jacket? - Oh! - You swear? - I swear. - Look at me. Word of honor? - Word of honor. Right. Are you unwell? You're making gestures. Come to dinner! Sit down. Excuse me. I've something to say to Fernand. Can you come a second? Come on. Tell me... I saw you born, so I'll call you "tu". But you're a man, so I shouldn't. Tomorrow I'll call you "vous". Go now! Excuse me. Don't tire yourself. - Serve me my lunch here. - Very good, Sir. - This fruit I don't know... - Learn it. - Grapefruit. - I'll write it down. How do you spell it...? It's spelled p-a-m-p-l-e-m-o-u-s-s-e. Hello? Would you ask Mr Pelle... It's you? Hello. Dr Marcelin. You were kind enough to bring back my jacket... But tell me, did anything fall from the jacket when you found it? No. Not a wallet. A sealed envelope. No? Oh... Do ask everybody, please. Hello? No? Nothing? Oh... What can you do... - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm not speaking to you. I hope to see you soon, too. Goodbye. Jesus Christ! Hello? Maitre Bellock's practice? I'd like to speak to Mr Bellock. It's Dr Marcelin. Hello? It's me, Marcelin. Yes, it is me. I'm eating. Sorry. Did anyone drop off a sealed envelope at your place? Not at all. Listen to me. It's a will. A new one. It supersedes the one you have. No, not at all. I've lost it. Yes. Very bothersome. For quite a few people. Oh no! If anyone had found it, they could have given it to you. You reckon! If it happens, call me quickly. Thanks a lot. There. Thank... Not likely! What? Very funny! Well, thank... Oh! Thank you. Two hours on the phone for that! I'll tell him you're here but Sir never receives in the morning. - What? - Someone's here. - Who? - A lady in mourning. - What does she want? - To see you. Not in the morning. Ever. She says it's very urgent. It can't be that urgent if she's in mourning. I can't do anything. It's too late. I'll see her anyway. - Has Sir finished? - Oh! Right... - Is Miss Lecourtois here? - Not yet. Very well. When you sweep in the morning... What are you doing here? I've come to say hello. - What? - I've come to say hello. I didn't catch that. Hello. Someone's here. Didn't you hear it ringing? I thought it was a supplier or your secretary. - So now you know? Go on. - Right... I have to see someone and you're in your bathrobe! - I just said hello. - We both said hello. Go on, my dear. And we look cruel, too. That's the oddest thing. Come this way. Come and sit down. - Whom did you lose? - Nobody. - Then why the veils? - I was lent them. Look... Nobody must know I came to see you. Thanks to these veils, Lucie didn't recognize me. - Did she cross the lounge? - Just now. I've something awful to tell you. I'm betraying a secret, but in memory of our madness, I couldn't lie to you. - I know everything. - No. - Yes. - No. - Right. - I know what you know but you don't know this: it was in your jacket. - What? - The will. Impossible! - Your wife opened it. - And she read it? We all read it aloud. - Oh, good God! - Yes... - Oh! - Yes, my friend. Lucie knows about your daughter and your mistress, I about my son, and my husband about you and me. That's frightful. You're discreet, but when you cut loose... I can laugh because you're alive but we were in an insane situation. But when I came in... The situation was reversed. We were about to attack each other but we all turned against you. An alliance was established between us and we said as one voice, "Not a word. Hide the will." It was ill-considered, but that was our wisdom. Well... - What are you thinking about? - That. But what in particular? I was thinking of the dinner, during which you all hid your feelings. It's wonderful and instructive. Were you hoping to be the only hypocrite? No. But you're all four pretty talented. - But Lucie and you... - What? When you were alone... "Goodnight, goodnight." - No allusions? - Nothing. - I envy you. - Oh? I had to tell him everything, our entire fling. He wanted to know the smallest details. After 25 years, wasn't he smart enough to be quiet? - Oh no. - That's awful. - It was awful for him. - Not for you? Less. He made me relive those turbulent times and it was the first time I'd told anyone about them. I forgot I was talking to my husband. I realized that mistake was the only pleasant time in my entire existence. What you just said is frightful. - And true. - Well, yes. Our only pleasant moments are those stolen by mistakes. - What's good burns your stomach. - Right. - Life is badly organized. - Right now, yes. - Hello. - Hello. - God! So long ago. - But so near. - I can see it all now. - So can I! - Yes...! - 18 Avenue Malakoff! I never pass without looking at the 4th floor... - It was the 2nd. - No. It was. But after 25 years, one mustn't be demanding. - Those little biscuits... - What a laugh we had! - The water heater! My God! - What's wrong? - How old is your son? - Don't worry. - He's not mine? - I swear he isn't. You're sure he's your husband's? Oh... I just swore he isn't yours. - But then... - What? - You made more than one mistake? - No. It was the same. - How so? - I did that to erase it. - I was so sad... - Someone else gave you a child. The child that enabled me to forget you. - You cuckolded me! - You hate him? - You mustn't. - Has he suffered most? - Quiet, naughty. - Naughty but admirable. You don't hate him. - As you say in your will. - I do? You find the son avenging his father's honor racy. But it's not his real father... If I'd known, I'd have said so. - Where's my will? - Lucie kept it. She put it in her bodice. How did she react when she read it? I daren't tell you. I have to know. After the initial shock, the question was, who was your daughter. - What? - We can't be sure. - What you say is interesting. - You did it on purpose. No. She wondered which one was my daughter? - Yes. - It's of no interest to her. She knows that one is your secretary. Because of the name! Oh, that's amusing! She's looking for my secretary. She stopped looking when she found the two photos. She found those? That's not good! - She thought you were dead. - So she had time! Rummaging in a living man's pockets is imprudent, rummaging in a dead man's pockets is desecration. It's necessary, but not urgent. - I doubt she thought me dead. - No. She meant it. - Bad luck, then. - Why? It's a shame she was able to hide her joy yesterday. And seeing you under these sinister veils, - she thought, "The lucky cow!" - No! 30 years of medical experience have taught me that when someone accepts someone's approaching death, it's just like they wished for it... Were the photos useful? - Your granddaughter... - My granddaughter... She looks a lot like her mother. - The resemblance... - Is evident. You want to see her? - The photo? - The person. - See her? - She's coming. - Coming? - Yes. I mustn't know my will has been opened. Lucie naturally plans to dismiss her. I won't let her! I want to save her the affront that Lucie will give her. You're still lovely. Thank you. - I don't like to ring for her. - I quite understand. - Hello. - Hello. My new secretary. - Madam. - Miss. Sleep well? Very well. And you? - Not badly. Where is the mail? - On your desk. Thank you. I hadn't seen it. You left yesterday... - I can explain... - It's not a reproach. It was after 9 o'clock, and I admit that before I went to bed I omitted to sign it. Charming. I think she heard. She lowered her eyes. It's like being at the Post Office. - Here. - Thank you, Sir. - No prescription? - For Madam? No. Madam's affection is healed. - Is it not? - Yes. - No prescription. - Madam. Miss. I've got it. - You've got it! - She doesn't know she's your child. Not stupid yet incorrect. - She doesn't know she's my mistress. - No. Your daughter. - To think she could be my daughter. - She is! - Why do you think so? - The way you look at her... When a man is 25 years older than his mistress, he looks at her with a father's eyes. - So she's your mistress? - I don't know any more. - I'd rather not know. - How convenient... - What will you do? - I have no idea. - What would be your dream? - I don't dream any more. We greet each event with pleasure. - I should divorce. - No! Definitely not. She's just thinking of her son. - Do you really want to? - Divorce? No. I don't know whether it'd be mad or wise. Do you know why I don't want to? - Because you love her. - Who, my wife? - I'd divorce her if I loved her. - No! It's far more cruel not to divorce. "You cheated on me, I don't care." - She wouldn't take it like that. - No. - Basically, she loves you. - Don't say that, I'm going. - I get that impression. - It's false. I've always cheated on her. She'd have guessed if she loved me. Her misconduct didn't drive me away from her. Love each other, when we spent last night not arguing? That's not love. It's the opposite of love. Lucie and I form one of those deplorable couples who never find a reason to split up. That is our punishment and our safeguard. - We'll live as neighbors. - As good friends. No. As parents. We won't look at each other at all. We'll live in profile, like this. We'll resign ourselves to not being unhappy. There was all this. I'll stay because of it. My mistress or my daughter. If I divorce, I'll marry my mistress. She's 23, I'm 48. - It's dangerous. - Serious. - What if it's your daughter? - Then why change? You left her mother to marry Lucie. - You left me for her. - Yes... - Why did I hire her? - As revenge. - Platonic revenge. - Cruel. So you think I threw myself on the girl? I see you neglect her then give her a third of your fortune, dresses... That's not true. Who's in the photos? Her at three and now. She's very clever! So you reckon I'd rather preserve my freedom on this side - than shackle it on that side? - Exactly. I don't consider you an idiot. Now I'll confide in you: neither do I. But she is your wife. No. Don't say that. It's a mistake vanity forces us to make. It's a mania for possession. We say, "My wife, my train..." I call her "my wife" even when she cheats on me. No. It's "a" train and it's "a" wife. She bears your name. She's on her way out. Yes, she bears my name. That's quite barbaric. Like my dog, she should carry my address so she can be brought back. - Goodbye. - Goodnight. Delicious! See Madam out. - Look... - Nothing at present. I have problems. My new secretary's going, so unless your health's in peril, go! Don't make me shout. Go! You can invite your mother for lunch, I'm not lunching here. - Who is it? - Mr Worms. - God! Father or son? - Father. Thankfully. Out you go. That way. Go out that way and hide the knives. I've been trying to reach you for an hour. Listen to me. The Bey of Tunis is waiting at the Hotel Crillon. It's not a fracture, just rheumatism. X-ray him and call with the results. - But... - Go on, he's waiting. Run. Hurry along! Some fresh air at last! Hello, fresh air. It's hard, stopping people saying what you don't want to hear. - However... - Yes? - Spare me 5 minutes. - No. - No. 10, 20, 30, 40... - 5 minutes. - I need to talk. - What's the matter? - I almost didn't come. - Why? Something serious happened yesterday. - Come now! - Very serious. Sit down. Your wife was scornful, hurtful, and she offended me. - Oh! - She said awful things to me: that it wasn't my place, that I'd got the wrong house, that I should leave. - You should have answered back. - I did. - I wasn't polite. - Well done. - She'd been nasty. - No doubt. - What time was that? - It must have been around 8 o'clock. She thought I was long gone. - She was annoyed. - Indeed. I didn't want to leave. She became infuriated. She hurt me on purpose so that I'd respond to have a reason to sack me. She hates me. Everything about me exasperates her. Like I'm insulting to her. Look at yourself. It must offend her. That's how she felt at 8 last night but the feeling grew at around half past 8. - Yes. - Why? It'd take too long to explain but she wonders if you're my daughter or my mistress. - That's terrible! - It is rather curious. With all to fear from a person with no self-control, - we must talk. - When you wish. - Immediately. - I'm listening. It's tricky. I have a few questions to ask you first. I'm sorry, I called you "tu". - You do it automatically. - No! - Yes. - It's not possible! - I beg your pardon. - It's all right. You said "automatically"... I warned your mother we'd be having this talk. Juliette, do you remember your father? Yes. He was a big man with a beard and a mustache. I can't tell you anything else. I wouldn't recognize him. - What name did you use for him? - None. - What? - No. I begged mother never to mention him. I want to be able to meet him without embarrassment, without imagining I'm attracted to him or have to run away from him. - You don't hate him? - No. - Carry on. - I wanted to be discreet. I don't know that I've fully understood it, but I don't hold it against him. I know it's thanks to him I've been educated. You could have thought his conduct towards your mother... No. I've seen so many unhappy households that I'm grateful to him because he could have made my mother even more unhappy. I consider myself an accident. I feel like I'm surplus to requirements on earth but I'm here as a favor. - I'm an accidental birth. - It's a fact. And there's something else that speaks in his favor. - Not all men are fathers. - But you are all mothers. Even without children, we are mothers. A man doesn't feel like a father until his child is born. He's 9 months behind the mother. I have the distinct feeling that I'm the daughter of a man, of a lover, but not of a father. - You know nothing of him? - I know he's married. - He could be Consul of France. - Yes. Exactly. - I don't think so. - Why? Some things are easy to believe while others, though unacceptable, are true. Probably. Yes... We're not born by force... And yet, who knows, if this man one day introduced himself to you, if he needed or wanted to see you again... I'd tell him I'm sorry he wasn't happy. Not bad. Right... Well, wouldn't you know that 23 years ago, I had a beard and mustache. - Did it suit you? - No. Not very well. It seems I looked a lot like your father. I'm not surprised. That's the feeling I got when I met you. And when your mother told you I'd asked her to bring you here? I thought that I was ill, that Mommy wanted me to see you. - You knew me? - You are very well known and Mommy came to Paris to consult you now and then. One day you came to Melun to see me. How do you know? Do you remember? Vaguely. - I was very ill. - Yes, my dear. Very. - I can see you in the fog. - The fever... - Did I almost die? - You mustn't say that. It's an awful word. My dear... - You were ill. - The next day it was over. Yes. - Thanks to you. - Perhaps. So the fact I'm alive now I owe to you more than my father. He gave me life without wanting to, but you meant to save me. Thank you. - You stayed all night. - My God, I should think so! You'd give your life for a sick child. - You've still to pay for my visit! - Willingly. Right. In that case, all I need is a look of encouragement. Yes? I can? Right. When I called you to show you to her, because I did want to show you to her... You must have guessed. You're a good guesser. You know what that lady said to me about you? "She's your daughter, and she doesn't know it." - How funny! - It is funny, indeed. Well, you see, she was speaking the truth. - No, she was wrong. - Why's that? She was wrong? - I am your daughter, I knew it. - My child! Is that Joan of Arc? It's not Paul Deroulede! It's Joan of Arc. - There's only one? - Yes. - Yes. She was a unique woman. - No... The statue. There's one at Place des Pyramides. But hang on. - What? - It's not as good. - I don't care about the statue. - Taxi! That often happens. - What? - It happens, with Joan of Arc. People think there's only one. - You think yours is the right one. - I've seen both. What about the one on Bd St-Marcel? - A third? - Yes. - Come on, quick! - Let's go. Hot chestnuts! Hot chestnuts! You knew there were three statues? No, Sir. I didn't know about the one in Place St-Augustin. Do you know this one and the Pyramides one? I know the one on Bd de la Chapelle. There's a fourth? Sir begged me to show Sir in. - You're mad! - Why? - What are you doing here? - I don't know. He called and asked me to come at 7.45. - Who? - Your husband. It wasn't him, it was a mistake! It was him, I recognized his voice. - What will he say to you? - There's no doubt he'll give me the sack. - Who told you I was here? - Theophile. - Why did he tell you? - Yes. Why did he tell me? - We're going to find out. - It's shady. - I waited all over for you. - You think I was going to... - Did Madam call? - Yes. Why did you announce Fernand? Sir asked me to. - I didn't ask... - Not you, Sir. Sir. Madam's husband. It was Sir...? He told me to call Madam when Fernand Worms came. Thank you, Theophile. - A trap. - Let's be careful. - He knows everything. - It's for a divorce. I've brought my lover home! - What do we do? - You go. Going now would make it that much worse now we've seen each other. - The bell. - It's not him. - Daddy and Mommy! - No. What does this mean? How dare you? Oh, Lucie, I didn't see you. - What's going on? - Why have you come? I received a cable from your husband. - My husband? - Yes. "Be at my place at 8 with your wife. Jean." - And you? - He asked me to come. - Didn't you know? - Not at all. Children, something strange is going on. - Did you know I came earlier? - No. What time? - He received a mourner. - Yes. - A lady smaller than her. - Yes. At 10 o'clock. I saw the lady by the porter's lodge. - Why did you come? - I wanted to see him. - You talked to him? - He didn't let me. Come now... What did he do to get rid of me? Send me to the Bey of Tunis, who wasn't expecting me. He must have thought I was an assassin, as he had me thrown out by two dreadful men. It's not funny! Where's it going with you and Jean? What he did to you, he did to me. - Sent you to the Bey? - No. He interrupted me when I tried to speak about... Something. Sit down, my dear. Sit down, Marguerite. Let's get this straight. We should... What does this mean? I'm doing what Sir asked me to do. Oh! This time, he's killed himself! Not again! - Is that him? - Yes. It's him. No. Well... Let's go back 24 hours and put our cards on the table. Give me back my will. - But... - Give me back my will, Lucie. It must be in your bodice. Look for it, find it, and put it here, on the table... What's happened to us is wonderful. Let's not just be the victims. Let's be the spectators. I want to share an instructive few minutes with you. Lucie's involuntary indiscretion puts us in an exceptional situation. You saw the blinding truth emerge from the well. I rang, and you sent it back to the well. 24 hours have gone by. Let's see it reappear. You had two choices open: to hide the will... I'd have done the same. I set the silent example. Or the other option: immediate drama... potentially dreadful. That would have been good. What did pooled wisdom dictate? Nothing very positive. As we're still at the same point. Let's examine the second choice. Are we going to fight in two minutes? Have you finished making fun of us? It's starting already. Leave him. It should be he who begins. He's senior. But I think you'd best send your son away. There's no point having him mixed up in our games... - I'm listening. - Well... I would not advise you to take that tone. Why not? What's happened is awful. The law will not support you. There's a statute of limitations. Just check article 638. - Which? - Of the Criminal Code. I went to seek advice from my lawyer. Adultery is a crime that is covered and punished by articles 336 and 337 of the Penal Code. - I should think so! - Yes. The article provides for a statute of limitations of 3 years. - Is that number 638? - Yes, dear. ...638 of the Criminal Code. I don't care about the code! You do, up to a certain limit. We've gone beyond the limit. You're flouting the Criminal Code? - Yes. - It'll do the same to you. You can't divorce for that. It's too late. You don't think I'm stupid enough to divorce? Why aren't you smart enough to keep quiet? Keep quiet? You want me to keep quiet? And not criticize you? I'll interrupt you anew. This time in the name of justice. At the time, she was 20, I was 23, you were 26. We weren't even calling each other "tu". If you want to say what you should have said before, call me "vous". And don't talk about friendship, as we were just mates. We weren't very good mates. Then we became friends, - and it's because of that... - That what? That I was of some use to you as a friend... Yes, you helped me. Don't talk like that, I'll answer you. The truth is there. Look at it. The truth doesn't scare me. You lent me 150,000 francs. - Not so loud. - Why? - I gave you back 150,000 francs. - Yes... Yes, I gave it back. In three checks of 50,000 francs. - Can I speak? - Yes. Speak. No. They bother me. Come over here. Come on. One second. Come on. You gave me back 150,000 francs, but I didn't cash your checks. - What...? - Ever. I went to fetch them to show you in case you took it like this. You think I'm out of order but you are. You see? That only lasts so long too. Yes. Go on home and rest, pal. I'm checking the time, because I'm in a rush. We could adopt a third solution, which I propose. The will wasn't opened. That's not bad. You saw it but didn't open it. You were worried about me but know nothing. I prefer that one. I see the jacket, jump on it and make the swap. I check my pockets and find my will. Oh! I take a deep breath. My good mood melts your anxiety. I say: the Faculty has just selected a dozen doctors to represent it on a study voyage. I'd be sorry to leave my work but when I return, I'll have the commander's tie. - Show appreciation... - Oh! Is this serious, darling? I'm not joking. They say it'll last at least three months. We're making a big sacrifice. - Do your wives go too? - Our what? - Your wives. - Not our wives. They said no. The matter of wives would have influenced the choice, - which would have been wrong. - Of course. - Three months? - Yes. That's good for us. - Why? - Why? You wanted to go to the mountains. You like that? - On the... - Down slopes. But you go up first. I don't like that but she loves it. So that'll offset her sorrow in a way. Is this true? You're leaving? - I'm leaving tonight. - Tonight? It was organized at the last minute. - Everyone goes alone? - She's interested... We've been asked to take our secretaries. - Oh! - They're uncompromising. - It's ready, Madam. - Dinner is served. There's dinner for everyone. Stay. We must see our joke through. - Excuse me... - Come through. - Bon appetit. - Thank you. Eat! If we knew that when we cheated on our wives we'd have to marry our mistress, we'd choose them better. I want us to be proud to love. There's nothing finer in the world. If that principle were established, I know someone who wouldn't have chosen a certain person... If you were sweet on a man of your age, a very handsome, very rich boy, and if he'd said: "Let's go," - you'd have gone. - Never! - Why not? - I wouldn't have abandoned you. They're inexhaustible. Think, darling. A woman who goes off with her lover doesn't abandon her husband. She rids him of an unfaithful wife. An unfaithful wife is quite useless. Should I have stayed in my office moping? If you'd believed it, it would have made you go. What made you go is the fear we'd soon find consolation. Admit that if I'd died as you assumed, - in a year, you'd be married again. - No. Admit it. I'll never dare die again. Sorry if I'm looking at my watch. As for you and this young man, you'll soon see that a fling has no more interest when it's no longer secret. To me, your affair was but a flirt. - Ah... - You imagine so many things. The trouble you almost had should be a lesson. - Ah... - I'm sure of it. - Tell me... - Yes? Can't your secretary stay... Not stay, but she can come with me. There's one more thing - that you must know. - What? - No... - Trust me. Leave it to me. Juliette, are you happy - to go with me? - But... If we were alone, what would you say? - Are you glad to come? - Yes, Daddy. Yes. At our age, at our time and in our situation, we should consider these events as providential, without which we'd never manage. Goodbye, my dear. THE END
