Hi. Do you also sell lemonade? Yes. Thanks. Where are you from? Iris. Iris? From Europe? No, I mean the Hotel Iris. Hello, Hotel Iris. Hello? Hello? Did you sleep well last night? Mari. Why didn't you tell me? Several guests have complained. Do you want people to mistake our hotel for a brothel? I'm sorry, Mama. Have the guests arrived, yet? No, not yet. - You called them? - Yes. You're lying again. Why do you always lie to me? Come. Listen, Mari. We only have the two of us... and nobody else... who we can rely on. We have to take care of the hotel grandpa left us. Yes, Mama. You have such beautiful hair. Just because I comb them for you every day. Dear Mary... I've been writing about Iris for a long time. Why did grandfather name the Hotel Iris? There are no such flowers here. But today someone told me... that Iris has another meaning... Goddess of the Rainbow. In Greek mythology... Iris is a goddess with wings. When she waves her colorful chiffon... she can fly where she wants. Why am I following him? Mary... I donâ€™t know. On that stormy night... the note he gave me... was so crumpled that it hurt me. When the storm was over... I took it... and smoothed it out with great care. Why are you following me? About that night? What? You're working at Hotel Iris? Yes. I do. That night was... awful. Are you going to the island? Yes. There's nothing interesting to see. - That's what I like about that island. I live there. - You live there? Isn't that impractical? The road is flooded at high tide, isn't it? There is a ferry. In Greek mythology there is a goddess named Iris. The goddess of the rainbow. The goddess of the rainbow. In the sagas, the rainbow is... the bridge that connects the world of Yin and Yang. Iris... symbolizes this rainbow. Have you seen my bracelet? Bracelet? How does it look like? The one I always wear to dance parties. No. I thought so. Where can it be? It was expensive... And the dress? I asked you yesterday to pick it up for me. Where is it? Did you forget? Yes. - I'll get it. - Not necessary. I'll pick it up myself on the way. - Thank you. Bye. - Bye-bye. My toothache is killing me. I need to go to the doctor. You came. Yes. I thought you wouldn't come. Why did you think that? Because... Girls usually don't want to be with guys my age. Don't say things like that. I work in the hotel every day. Sometimes I need a break. Surely you have friends. I've only one friend. I've known her since I was a kid. But she doesn't live here anymore. Does she live far away? Yes. Understand. Her name is Mary. Mary? Sounds like my name, doesn't it? But she is very different from me. She is more open-minded and cheerful. And she has many friends. In fact... I'm translating a novel right now. The main character is also called Mari. Are you a translator? Yes. I translate from Russian. What is she like? - Mari from the novel? - Yes. Like a flower with morning dew on its petals. A beautiful woman. My father gave me the name Mari. It suits you. What about your family? - My...? - Yes. I have no family. I'm alone... since my wife died. Why... did you write to me? On that day... you waved at me on my way back to the island. Just because of that? Is that strange? No. Today... you can also wave goodbye to me. Please start the boat. See you soon. OK. I'm home. Wait a minute. You were at the dentist for quite a while. Yes, Mama. I met Mary's grandmother on the way. Mary? Don't you remember her? Mary, Mama. We were together a lot when I was little. No, I don't remember anymore. Open the door. Open the door! You alcoholic! Go away! You're annoying! You're annoying! Shut your mouth! The mail for Iris. Move your feet like this. Pull in your belly. Make your arms an L. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. They act like a young couple. They don't behave their age. This dance teacher is a friend of your father. You know... At that night, when he was killed, this man was with him. He was even questioned by the police. Anyway, your mother isn't doing so well. What should she do with an alcoholic anyway? Mama's bracelet has disappeared. Yes, and? I tell her you stole it. I haven't. If I tell my mother this, you'll lose your job. And if the neighbors find out you're stealing, no one will hire you. I told you I don't have it! I know. You only steal from me. Dear Mary... I've been hearing a lot about you lately. Are you surprised? Sorry... that I used your name without your consent. But if it were a man's name... Mama would be suspicious. There is nothing special in this letter. It's all about the weather and the work. I long for the letters every day even if not one arrives every day. But it's nice to wait for something. I remember. I waited every night for Papa to come home. After his death... I had nothing left to wait for. Hi, Aunt. Can you stay at the front desk? I have to leave. Leave? Where to? To Mary's grandma. She invited me to lunch. Are you kidding me? What about work this afternoon? I asked aunt to help me. Didn't I? Yes. Thanks a lot. Hey, how are you? Don't run away. Don't act like you don't know me. Is she your new girl now? She seems very young. Hey... Girl let me warn you. Be careful with this guy. Because he's really sick. That's impossible. Please check again. I checked it several times. I made a reservation five days ago. Two terrace seats on the 2nd floor. There must have been a mistake. - Leave these excuses. - I'm really sorry. You... have to take responsibility for this. I'm sorry, but we are fully booked for today. Thank you. You... You... You! I want to speak to your manager to sort this out. The gentleman and lady, please come. What comes to your mind? What happened to your hair? Come. Please come in. May I take a look at your books? Yes of course. The Russian language... consists of incredibly beautiful symbols. Is that the book about Mary? Dear Mary... have you had this kind of experience before? I don't know if it's normal... what he did to my body. Mari... Look closely. That's you. That day... you were the girl who waved at me. And now you're the one in the mirror. Please remember. Open your eyes. Do you feel good? I ask you... Do you feel good? Yes. I feel good. Do you want more? Yes. I want more. Welcome. Is your mother there? - Who wants to know? - The police. They've found a body. Probably the whore who made a scene here. Do you remember? Is it her? Who knows? There are many whores here. So... So what? Did you tell the cop what happened at the hotel? No, of course not. It would not be good if rumors spread. On this island? A real pervert. Some say he fled here after murdering his wife. - Is that true? - Yes. Hello. Two ice creams, please. - No, one is enough. - Why? We need two. Papa and I used to eat ice cream... without telling Mama. You must love your father very much. Yes, but he died. I saw him when he was being taken back to the hotel. He had such a beautiful face. He didn't look dead. Do you often do things like this? Spending your nights with strangers? No, not very often. Have you paid that woman? Yes. Is that why you despise me? It is only... Am I also such a woman? I'm obsessed with a strange thought. Mirror, Mirror... Mary... You must have done the same... The same. I am here. He is there. Then, I look at him. Then, he looks at me the way I look at him. I look at him, look at me, look at him... Endlessly... But... it seems that only the two of us... are forever hidden in the world of the mirror. So wonderful... As long as I'm here... he won't be lonely. Not that! Why didn't you follow my orders? I said socks! Yes. Stick out your tongue. More. Leave us alone. I love this man. Once in a while... an unbearable horror comes over me. I'm locked up alone. Not even death is allowed. I wander alone in the endless darkness. Such a horror. Shut up, bitch! Welcome. Come in. This is my nephew. Nephew... How does it taste? Um... This is very tasty. (unusual) Glad to hear that. I'm pretty good at cooking. Do you always eat something like this? Yes, whenever my nephew visits. Why? He has no tongue. - No tongue? - He had tongue cancer... and had to have his tongue cut off. Sorry to hear that. Yes. That's a shame. He plays piano. Nobody can play like him. Right? So are you going to be a pianist? Maybe not. He wants to use his talent differently. He wants to be a teacher, a music teacher. He will continue his studies in Germany. Not in Germany? Italy? Right, in Italy. In Italy there is a music school for the deaf. There he wants to teach. I can't imagine teaching deaf people music. When is he going there? He's leaving next week. He took care of everything himself. Wait a moment. Are you going to the beach? It's windy and cold. Put this on. Take care. He always goes for a walk after dinner. Not today. Today's mail. Papa. May I ask you a question? Did you love me? Yes, of course I did. I still love you. That's not true. You're lying. I love Papa so much. But you don't love me. That's not true. That is not true. So... Have I been a good kid? Yes. Mari was always good. Really? Mari, do you dance? No, I don't dance. I used to be a very good dancer. I know. Papa was good at everything. - Good morning! - Morning. I invite you. Serve yourself. You wanted to ask me something. What? To be honest, that whore was murdered. And... I have something for you. I thought you were an innocent girl. Please touch me there. Please. I've done a lot naughtier than that. Have you? Where is he? Let me ask you this. People in town could see these photos. You really don't know anything? No. OK. If you remember anything, get in touch with me. Goodbye. Hello. Are you alone? Where is your uncle? Do you know where he is? When did he go? What was your aunt like? You are his son. His stepson. Your mother remarried? Your mother died. From an illness? From what? Was she murdered? An accident? How? A traffic accident? So... did you grow up with him? Is that your mother's scarf? Come in. He will be sad... if you go. Me? You mean he has me? He has... told you something about our relationship? You can see it. He... loves you very much... Mari. Where are you? - Oh no. Mama is home. - Mari! - Mari! - Sorry. I'll be back soon. Don't read it! Why are you keeping it? Mari. Look at me. Please. Look at me. You're not looking at me properly anymore... since that man died. Do you want to keep the photo forever? Mari. Don't you remember what that man did to you? Be quiet! Go away! Go! It doesn't matter anymore. Let's go home. What about the police? Are you sure it's okay? Police? It's terrible. The police is wrong. - You're not the killer? - No, of course not. What time is it? Are you awake? It's already afternoon. Have you been working all the time? Yes. There is not much time left. For the story of Mary? Yes. I need to finish it today. Is it difficult? How much longer do you need? The hotel... is certainly in chaos now. What a face would mom make... if she knew that I'm with a man? Why don't you try to talk to your mother? She will understand. OK. Can you wake up my nephew? It's already late. OK. Such a beautiful face. Don't you think so? He looks like my late wife. He shouldn't live anymore. You've met with him. Without me. Just the two of you. My wife's cause of death is written on it. My beloved wife... died protecting that boy. Who? Who are you? Who are you? What are you asking, fool? I am you. Say it... What have you done to my beloved boy? What have you done? Tell me. I cheated on you... You don't have to hide it from me. I know everything. Yes. No more secrets. Do you want to be punished? Yes. I want to be punished. A strange thought... spreads through me. Mirror, Mirror... Mary... You must have done the same... The same. Mari. Who am I? You are... me. Who are you? I am... you. Who am I? You are me. And who are you? I am you. Do you hate me? Yes. I hate you. Do you love me? Yes. I love you. Mari... I love you too. I am here. He is there. Then, I look at him. Then, he looks at me the way I look at him. I look at him, look at me, look at him... Endlessly... But... it seems that only the two of us... are forever hidden in the world of the mirror. So wonderful... As long as I'm here... he won't be lonely. I know this man. I've met him before. He lived on that island. It's strange. Who would live at a place like this? How are you now? What happened to Mari after that? Yes, Hotel Iris. Hello? Hello? Excuse me. Welcome! Thanks a lot. Room number seven. Thank you. Good night. Good night.
