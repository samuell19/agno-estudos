Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK All right, break it up. Get back. Get moving. What happened? - All right, break it down. - All right, move along. Make mine a scotch and soda, double. What about you? - I'll have a root beer. - Root beer? Well, it's your liver, my friend. Night desk? About that shooting... the guy that was shot, his name is Leonard Moss. M-O-double "S". As in "Sam," yeah. Hold it. Let's have another, same thing. He was in a crap game. Uh, hold it. - Hey, you all right? - I just never saw a stiff before. No? Well, I always thought newspaper reporters... This is my first day at it. Okay, I'll call you later. Ernie wants us to stick around a while just in case. - You all right? - I'm all right. It's probably that stuff you're drinking. How about bringing that bottle with you? All right. Another thing you've got to remember about newspaper work... The public always expects a newspaperman to do a lot of drinking... and so you mustn't ever let the public down. - You think this story will make the front page? - Be lucky to get in at all. One dice hustler shoots another dice hustler. So what? They don't seem to have the murders these days like they used to. Different class of people, I guess. - What's the matter with this crate? - That thing ain't worked in 10 years. I... I don't suppose there's any connection... but we haven't had a real good juicy murder story in this town... since the Democrats got hold of the country. Back under the Republicans... Well, how do you like that? Ten years? That's more like 15. Yeah. # Mine in May, His in June # # She forgot mighty soon # 1927. Remember that? Yeah. Uh-huh. # There they go in their joy # # Happy girl, lucky boy # # And here am I # # Brokenhearted # That's what I mean. That's the song they sang for Roxie Hart. - And was that a story. - What was? Roxie. - Customers. - All right. I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em. Hello, boys. Charge your glasses, gentlemen. To Roxie Hart... the prettiest woman ever tried for murder in Cook County. - Okay, partner. To Roxie Hart. - To Roxie Hart. Well, what about her? - You remember that story? - Yeah, some of it. 1926, '27, '28... the bad old days when everything went and everything was big... big money, big crooks, big murders, big stories. "Keep cool with Coolidge." "Keep cockeyed with Capone." "Keep daffy with Daddy Browning." This seems to call for a spot of music, and serve everybody a round on me. What about Roxie Hart? Roxie Hart, the Teapot Dome, The 18th Amendment, the Monkey Trial, Carl Wanderer... Texas Guinan, Mayor Thompson. # The black bottom # # Black bottom # Hall-Mills, Judd Gray and Ruth Snyder. I wanna hear what you got to say about Roxie Hart. Why not? That was the best of them all. That was all of them rolled into one... 15 years ago... and I remember it like it was yesterday. That first flash of a shooting. The police? This is Finnegan the janitor at 1442 South Melrose. Somebody just shot somebody in apartment six! And I make this statement voluntarily and of my own free will. - Freely and gladly. - I fired five shots into the man... - Smack into him. - Killing him instantly. Like a dog. - Cheerful little assassin. - Assassin? Is it assassination to shoot a burglar? What would you do if you came home and found somebody banging on the bedroom door? - Check on the wife. - But she wasn't here, I tell you. Wasn't nobody here. I come home from the poolroom and... You know, I'm the best snooker player down there. - Yeah. And as I go... - Come on. Come on. Sign it. He ain't tryin' the case. He's just a reporter. Not bad, huh? One hour, and we got the guy and a signed confession. Last week, a jury thanked a man for killing a burglar. This week, they're giving a Hupmobile. - Where do you think the madam could be? - The what? - The wife. - The movies, maybe. Come on, let's go outside and have a talk with the prosecutor. Say, is he trying to insinuate something? - How do you look at this thing? - That's my wife. She's artistic. Ah, I'll never see anything that reminded me less of Whistler's Mother. - Everybody through with this? - It's all yours, Doctor. I believe that if everybody would love everybody else... Okay, Billy Sunday, let's go. Yeah. Well, that's about all it is, I'm afraid... routine 12-B. Yeah. Joe the Jerk defends the little nest... while Miss Flapper Wife is out mooning over John Gilbert. Okay, Tommy. See you later. - How do? Oh, no, you don't! - Oh, may you think... I want to have a couple of words with you. That's all I want. Oh, hey! Cut it out, will ya? I only want to say a word... - Let me go! - Oh, no. Will you cut it out? I'm not a copper! - What are you? - I'm a newspaperman. - All right! - Let me go! Oh, no! There's a cop there, lady. You want me to call him or not? - What do you want? - I want the story. I want you to tell me what really happened in here. - You heard him. I was... - Oh, don't give me that. You weren't skinnying around the outside of this building for your health. - Come on, let's have it. - You let me go! - You plugged him, didn't you? - Are you batty? Come on. What are you scared of? They won't do anything to you. This county never does anything to a dame. Cook County is the most gallant county in the whole country. Why, a pretty murderess is as safe here, as she is in her mother's arms. What do you want me to do, say I shot him when I didn't? - Oh, no, you're not. Come here. - Let me go. Cut it out, will you? You do that again, I'll break your arm. No, uh, uh, uh! No more billy goats either. Oh, oh, please let me go. I didn't do it. I swear I didn't. He shot him! Yeah, but why did he shoot him? Because he busted in and caught you. Oh, he didn't have to bust in. The door was open. Oh, mercy me. Mercy me. Bring the body back in the parlor. - We gotta get outta here. - Oh, no! Cut it out. Look, honey. You and me is gonna have a nice little talk. Look, honeysuckle, you get right in there... and Daddy will be back in just a few minutes. We met this gentleman downstairs. He says he knows the stiff. Who are you? E. Clay Benham at your service... of Benham and Casely, theatrical booking agents. That is... or that was my partner, the late Mr. Casely. I don't want to seem crude, but I'd like somebody to make up their mind about these remains. He wasn't no midget, remember. You positively identify this man? - Gladly. That is, naturally. - Take it away. Just ring twice anytime. Service with a smile. - What do you know about this? - Very little, I'm afraid. - I didn't even know that Roxie was married. - Roxie? Mrs. Hart. She was a client of ours in a way of speaking. - We weren't able to place her. - What particular talent was she peddling? She described herself, I believe, as... as a dancer. I don't believe it. She wouldn't lie to me like that. She was here washing the dishes all the time. My dear fellow, it's a matter of record. She's been on Mr. Casely's doorstep for weeks. Only this afternoon, she insisted on another audition. And she told me she'd never seen him before. Never seen him before in her life! A complete stranger! She, uh, liked Mr. Casely? Well, let us say, rather, that Mrs. Hart was ambitious and female. - A coquette. - The word is nicely chosen. Mr. Casely was responsive to her appeal? Fred was a man who was always sensitive to a well-turned ankle. A wolf? "De mortuis nil nisi bonum." - Yeah. A wolf. - But why? - Is... is Roxie the one that plugged him? - She is! Why should I try to protect her? What should I take the rap when all the time she was lying to me? I bring her to Chicago, I get her a job and this is what she does to me. I wasn't even in the room. I was coming up them stairs when "bang, bang, bang, bang". There she was with the rod in her hand and him folding up right there. - Well, this is a little more like it! - And all the time, I'm trying to believe her. I'm trying to make myself believe her because I wanted to believe her. - Where is she now? - On the roof, hiding. - Excuse me. - Downstairs. Cover the building. You come with me. On the Hart story, a perfectly lovely situation has developed. Joe the Jerk has now pinned it on the little woman. - I want to issue a statement. - Oh, hold it, Tommy. You're not going to change your mind again, I hope. Why, you liar! I didn't do it! Let me out of here! Hold it, Tommy, they're coming through the walls. - Let me out of here! - Boy, it is Mrs. Hart. Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy, will you, honey? You don't want to damage your defense. - Nothing doing down here. - All right. Help the sergeant up here. - I'll watch the fire escape. - Okay. Keep this wire open, Tommy. Santa Claus is coming. Wait till I get my hands on that dirty double-crosser. Will you pipe down? - Double-crossing me... - Here's your lead. Roxie Hart... the prettiest woman ever charged with murder in this county... has just surrendered to a representative of the Gazette. - While the constabulary... - All you got to do is to sign this. - The cops are still on the roof. - Did you hear what he said? What? You really think I'm so, uh, pretty, like you said? Honey, you are a garden of hollyhocks. - How old are you, dear? - Eighteen. Roxie is 23 and red-headed. Listen, old boy. Let me get the girl signed up before those monkeys get back down here. - All right. Hold it, Tommy. - What's that? All you got to do, my dear, is to sign this contract. What contract? This is just a blank piece of paper. - Not even any fine print on it. - I'll fill that in later. Cabarets, personal appearance, everything! We'll clean up! Unless, of course, you swing. What is this... the insane asylum? You're beginning to give me the creeps. You're not gonna swing. Women don't swing in this county. - And will you stop saying "swing"? - Listen, Roxie. You are a very lucky girl. Today you are nobody, and who cares? Tomorrow money couldn't buy the publicity you'll have... column after column of it. Pictures, measurements, what you eat, what you drink... how you feel when you get up in the morning, advice to young girls. - On the radio. - Everybody in the country will know you. They'll fight to see you. Like when you cross the sidewalk... from the patrol wagon to the courtroom door. They'll want your autograph. They'll grab your clothes for souvenirs. They'll wanna kiss you so they can tell their grand children. A million-dollar production, and you're the star. I'm telling you, honey you'll be right up there with Peaches Browning... William Jennings Bryan, Queen Marie, Ma Ferguson. - Mutt and Jeff. - Red Grange, Ruth Snyder... Aimee Semple McPherson, Barney Google. Don't you understand, dear? This is Chicago, the city of opportunity. And that city only awaits one word from you to be at your feet. Well, maybe I'm crazy. - Listen, you... - Let me out of here, please. Are you going to throw away a veritable fortune? How am I going to spend that fortune in a cemetery? You won't have to, I tell ya. - Who's going to stop it... you? - Billy Flynn. - Billy Flynn? - You mean the great mouthpiece? Get Billy Flynn, and you can write your own ticket. Yes, and use it. The streets of the city are congested with women... that Billy has saved from their just desserts. Well, do you think he'd take me? Honey, Willy would take an ape-woman if there was enough publicity in it. Hum... he's good-looking too, isn't he? Sex appeal rises from him like a cloud of steam. - But you don't think there'd be any... - Honey, I keep telling you... - this county wouldn't hang Lucrezia Borgia. - I wouldn't want to get in any jam, you know. It's money from home. That's the only way to describe it. You don't think that... all this you said about my career... you don't think I could have it if I was innocent? - Oh, Roxie, please. - Oh, Roxie, please, will ya? Well, then... of course. Naturally, I want to do everything ...everything I can for my career. All right, honey. What's her name? Roxie? All right, Roxie. Give it to us big mouth. Give us plenty of teeth. The old smiling face. And fine, hold it. Go! Wonderful! Wonderful! Now, let's see. If I'd known this in time, I'd have got a marcel. Uha... this will be a nifyy, though. Head up. That's fine. - You got her in focus, boys? Get the orchid in. - Uh... this is wonderful. Wonderful. Love it. - Is that her? - Yeah. Pip, huh? But she's just a girl... like me. Heh... how's that? I thought she'd be older and... more sinful-looking. - She's... she's beautiful. - There's her husband. Now, listen. I don't want any of this to get in the newspapers. I want the whole thing kept perfectly quiet. Sure, sure. You're too smart a guy. Step right over here. Oh, no. You ain't gonna drag me into this. You're already drug, you dope. Stop stalling and get over there. - We gotta catch the main edition. - I won't do it! There you are. No spirit of cooperation. Now, listen. You want people to think you're a yellow dog and ran out on your wife? - A low, dirty bum. - What else is he? Getting in, show the world you're gonna stand by her through thick and thin. The old bulldog spirit for the woman I love. How 'bout it, kid? Why, with a man like you at her side a woman could fight the whole world... lefty. - Well, naturally, if I thought... - Atta boy! We'll send you a copy to hang in your den with the rest of your trophies. - What about the stiff? - The corpse? No corpse is gonna pose with me. Especially that one. Count me out. Get back, honey. The stiff is gone. - It's enough with that. - We don't need the stiff. - Hey, Fido. Lay down. Play dead. - Here? Yeah. You, right over here now. Try and unloosen. That's fine. Beautiful. Beautiful. Come on, everybody, big smile. Beautiful. - How's this pose? Is this a good one? - The knees, babe. How about a profile? I hate to lose any part of that kisser, but let me see. - Good. You're asking his forgiveness. - Who's asking whose forgiveness? - Look, Roxie. Cooperate. - The knees, the knees. I don't know why I want to get mixed up in this. You move out of there, and I'll bat you one, so help me. I'll give you such a rap... you... Roxie, you're begging his forgiveness. Husband, you're smiling sweetly. Counselor, look official. That's it. Hold it, everybody. The knees, Roxie, the knees! That's the way it started... small. But, brother, how it grew. In one week, Roxie Hart was the best-known dame in the United States. Her fame covered this whole country like the morning dew. Like the dew. The prettiest woman ever charged with murder in the history of Chicago. Pretty soft, huh? That's the way it looked, yeah. Like a setup, a pushover. No risk, no danger, no chance of a conviction. Huh... that's the way it looked then. That's what she thought. Do you seriously think Billy Flynn is going to waste his time... on every two-bit scuffle that gets into the papers? Two-bit scuffles? Eight pictures and nine columns in two days. I guess that ain't the bee's knees. My dear girl, do you realize that during my first week here I had a total of 15 pictures... 27 and half columns and an editorial denouncing me? Please, you're so awful... - it's all I can do to keep my mind on you. - Children! Hear you talk, you'd think you were queen of the jail. Well, permit me to remind you, Miss Sloppy... your whole case is a very low-class affair... whereas my friend... - was in the social register. - On a pass? In my opinion, Mrs. Hart, you're a very ordinary bum, and you might as well face it. Bum? I'll "bum" you! Ooh! Children. You girls have got to stop this squabbling. Let's see. Where was I? Altogether, Mr. Benham and I managed to raise $ 1,400 off the furniture. - Never mind how, just count it out. - Then there's 500 from the savings... - and 500 from Roxie's life insurance. - That's 2,400. Three hundred that I borrowed, and 700 from the building and loan. - That's 3,400. - And that's all. - All? - All so far. I figured I could pay you, say, 20 a week. I could give you interest. Maybe double interest. Now just a minute, Hart. When you came to me and said, "Mr. Flynn, will you take this case?" Did I say, "Is she innocent or is she guilty?" No. I said nothing like that. I simply said, "Have you got $5,000?" Didn't I? That's right. You've been perfectly fair with me. All right, then I expect you to be fair with me. What about her father and mother? You tried them? Well, I don't think they got much. Whatever they've got, they'll give to save their daughter, their little baby, won't they? - Well, I don't know. - You don't know? Why, Hart, that's the most cold-blooded thing I've ever heard a man say. To even question the willingness of a father and mother to come to the aid of their child... - flesh of their flesh, bone of their bone. - Well, I didn't mean... Where are they? Get them on the phone right now. - They live down in the country. - Well, call them. - It's long distance. - We'll put it on the bill! Call them! Will you get me Mr. Magnus J. Wadsworth in Zanesboro? The best friend any of us can have in this world may turn against us and become our enemy. Our son, our daughter that we reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those we trusted with our happiness and good name... may prove traitorous to that faith. But when all others have fled, when riches have taken wing... and reputation fallen to pieces... there still remains one absolutely unselfish friend in this selfish world... one who will never desert us. one who will never prove ungrateful nor treacherous. That's a man's dog, ain't it? - That's right, it is. I was thinking it was... - Mr. Wadsworth, this is Amos. - Roxie's in some terrible trouble. - What? Yes. Yes. No. - And if we don't do something pretty quick... - Do what? I said, they're liable to... hang her. Good! - They're gonna hang Roxie. - What did I tell you? Now, let's get this straight, tootsie. I haven't committed myself on this proposition yet. Maybe I'll be able to handle it and maybe not. It all depends on developments. But I'm going to give you a few tips just in case. Well, - Maybe I shouldn't say this, but... I didn't do it. - You didn't do it? Oh, well, then I'm not sure I'm the man for the job. Now, if you're guilty... - Please, please. I'm sorry I mentioned it. - Oh, that's all right. I'll keep it in mind in case of emergency... but for the present, we'll proceed along the customary lines. Now, what we gotta do first is to go after sympathy through the newspapers. The story of your life starts tomorrow in the Herald. - From kindergarten to jail. - What? My secretary is writing it this afternoon, signed with your name, of course. An authoress! Beautiful southern home, every luxury and refinement... magnolias, colored mammy, the full treatment. Educated in private schools, sheltered like a little flower, and then ruined. Parents dead, fortune swept away, a runaway marriage, and heartbreak. You were a lovely, innocent child, bewildered by what has happened. Young, full of life and lonely... caught in a mad whirl of a great city! - Music, lights, wine. - The black bottom! Like a moth to the flame. And now the cold, gray dawn... mad world ceased... a butterfly crushed on the wheel. And what's left? Regret. That's the important thing... regret! You'd give your life this very minute to bring him back. Why did I do it? Was I drunk or crazy? All you can remember is a fearful quarrel, and then he threatened you. - My honor? - No, no. We don't fall back on that unless we have to. He threatened to kill you. Later, we'll work out why. You can see him coming toward you now... with that awful look in his eyes, a wild look! And get this... you both grab for the gun, see? Self-defense. Whatever we work in later, that's there from the start. And everything went purple. Purple? - Black? White? Red? - Purple's good. It's new. "As you both grabbed for the gun, everything went purple." I like that. - The reporters are downstairs, dear. - Okay. - Okay. - Holy Moses. Haven't you got something else you could wear? - Well, what's wrong with this? - For a clip joint, it's great. But you gotta remember what I said, you dope... regret, remorse, unhappiness. No matter what happens, there can never be any more gaiety or happiness for you. - You'll never smile again, you understand? - I got it. Well, don't forget it. Birdbrain. Mrs. Morton, get me that black dress the one with the sunflower on the stomach. How is she today? Poor child! She's holding up magnificently, poor bewildered kid. Right now, she can hardly realize what's happened. Mr. Callahan, I've just seen Finnegan, the janitor. - What janitor? - At the apartment house. - And from what he says, she didn't do it. - Shh! Are you cr... are you nuts? What are you trying to do, kill this story? Listen, you are supposed to be a newspaperman... not a detective, you understand? You are supposed to build up a story, not tear it down. Gimme that. Never scare me like that again. Gentlemen, Mrs. Hart. Roxie, dear, this is Mary Sunshine, the famous feature writer. - And these are some gentlemen of the press. - How are you, Mrs. Hart? - So glad to meet you. - How you do? - Boy! - Oh, you poor child! Come, sit over here. We all understand. I'm going to leave now, Roxie, so Miss Sunshine and the boys... can interview you without being disturbed. Just answer their questions frankly. And don't forget what I told you. Yes, Daddy. Just a frightened kid, that's all. Good-bye, Mary. - Good-bye, boys. - Bye. - Good-bye, Jake. - Good-bye, Willy. - Excuse me. - Yes, yes, of course. - What's that? - Dinner from the Ritz, madam. There's two more outside, but just from restaurants, no other hotels. Listen to this... "My heart and hand are at your feet. "With you, my life would be complete. Yours with pleasure, an unknown admirer." Isn't that lovely? - Probably from Lord Byron. - Then why doesn't he sign it? - But, Mr. Flynn... - Now wait a minute. You get the dough, I'll get you a pass, and not before! But what kind of a jail is it... that everybody in the world can get in to the wife but the husband? Everybody's been so lovely. You know, I haven't had to eat this jail slop once. Ehh... just what did happen, Mrs. Hart? - How's that? - Tell us in your own words, why? Well, all I can remember is a dreadful quarrel, and then a threat. I can see him coming toward me now with that awful look in his eye. A wild look. Oh, look, alligator pears! Gee, that fella certainly does give out, does he? He was bearing down on you with that wild look... and then what? And then we both grabbed for the gun. And get that straight... we both grabbed for it. - And then? - And then... - everything went purple. - Purple? A purple... flash. Light or dark? Pardon? I say, light purple like lavender or dark purple like violet? Violet. - In other words, self-defense. - You can bet your sweet life it was. They'll be so glad to know you can eat. It's choking me, every mouthful, but I feel it's my duty. Oh, it is. It is. You've got to keep up your strength. I can't sleep at night either. All night long, I just walk up and down, tossin' the floor. You recall nothing specific during this, uh, purple patch? - How could I? Must have been mad, insane. - Oh, dear. Oh, no, not for the asylum, understand? Over with right away. Sane before and sane after... with a little teensy-weensy spot of insanity right in the middle. - Is that it? - That's it. Shoot me the jam, Sam. Is it true, Mrs. Hart, you were swept off your feet by jazz? Yeah, what about that black bottom? - Well... - You're good at it, ain't ya? - I ain't had no complaints yet. - How about a little sample? - Now? - Sure. Why not? Sure, Roxie. - Come on. Be a sport. - Give, Roxie. Boy! - Aw, you're really the nuttiest guy I ever saw. - Why don't you, Mrs. Hart. It might take your thoughts off your tragedy. Do a few steps for us. You don't think it might be what you call out of place? Certainly not. You think we'd ask you if it would be? Well. I don't know if I ought. Get away! Get away! Go on, scat! Who wants to see pictures of you, anyway? - I'm the husband, ain't I? - I don't believe it. Well, hush my big black mouth! Mrs. Hart, I think you're just wonderful. - What? - I know you didn't do it. I just know it. Huh, you're a sweetie pie to say that but if you print it, I'll wrap a chair around your neck. Kind of liked her, huh? "Kind of liked her"? That's putting it feebly. - I couldn't sleep for thinking about her. - Go on. I wanna hear some more. Oil for the lamps of China, gentlemen. A month later. # Chicago, Chicago, That toddlin' town # - Are you going to behave? - Let go, you! - Are you? - Let go, I tell you! - Are you? - Yeah! Let go of my hair. If I find you biting anyone else around here, I'll have the dentist pull every tooth in your head! Got a butt, buddy? Won't you tell us just how you happened to take up banditry, Miss Baxter? Did you suffer an inferiority complex? Hello, Miss Sunshine. Later, Mrs. Hart. Or would you describe yourself as a thrill slayer? Oh, Mr. Callahan. I got a scoop for you. I'm thinking of going on a hunger strike. Okay, kid. Happy hiccups. What about the guy who was with you? They got him outside. Maybe you'd like to take a peek at him. Do you want to come? Roxie. I'm awfully worried, Roxie. You're worried? Listen. My lawyer goes out of town on a vacation. My agent, whenever you want him, you can't find him. So, in 10 days, only one little scoop of a story and no pictures. And now this. You can figure for yourself how I feel. It's not that. Did you see that editorial in the Ledger this morning? About me? It said, "Why is it that men could be hanged in this county but not women?" It was called: "We demand equal rights for women". - Say! That's swell. - Roxie, please, this is serious. This case isn't going to be like the others. Everybody's getting sore... the mayor, the newspapers, the preachers, women's clubs, everybody. - It never was like that before. - You're sweet. Don't you understand? They're gonna try to make you pay the penalty. I never thought of anybody really worrying about me before. If anything happened to you, Roxie, I don't know what I'd do. How old are you? - Twenty-five. - Well. Listen, sweetie pie, I'll tell you a secret. Any old time the going gets too tough, all I have to do is say one word and I'm out. Just one word. That's all. So you needn't worry. I'm so happy. Is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, go find that Benham, that agent guy, and tell him I want some action. Right away. A proposition like this, you gotta keep it boiling. Something new all the time. When you got your whole future tied up in it... you gotta grab it by the horn and hit it while it's hot. Hit it while it's hot, grab it by the horn. # Hit it while it's hot, Grab it by the horn # # Hit it while it's hot # Well, sir, if you thought Roxie got a build-up you should have seen Two-gun Gertie's. Things moved fast in those days. Almost before you knew it... J. Edgar Hoover couldn't have found Roxie's name in the papers. Two-gun Gertie, Two-gun Gertie, Two-gun Gertie, that's all the papers could think about. But, gentlemen, class will always tell. Roxie, crushed to earth, will always rise again. Just when the hour was darkest, when obscurity seemed to have settled down permanently... over that brave little jailbird, up she zoomed again like a rocket. Like a rocket. Back to page one in every sheet in town. With one little twist of the wrist, one simple girlish idea... the queen of them all once more resumed her throne. # Rock-a-bye, baby on the tree top # # Chicago, Chicago That toddlin' town, toddlin' town # - # When the wind blows the cradle will rock # - # Chicago, Chicago # - # When the bough breaks the cradle will fall # - # Chicago, that toddlin'town # - # And down will come baby cradle and all # - # Chicago # Slowly, my dear. Slowly. Yes, Daddy. - Perhaps you better call me something else. - Yes, Daddy. Boy! Oh, you poor dear child. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm such a bother these days. - Comfortable, my dear? - Yes, Dad... dear Mr. Flynn. Game little woman. I've never seen anything like it. Isn't it gorgeous? Aren't you glad? Glad? Glad? To have your child born here? Now, now, dear, you promised me not to get upset again. Oh, what a story! What a tragedy! When is it to be, dear? Oh. Not till summer. June. Harrison's trying to postpone the trial, you know, till after election. For myself, it don't matter, but for the little one... Fat lot Harrison cares about that. Hello, Mr. Callahan. We'll make him care. I'll see to that. I'll call every woman's club in the city, every mothers' and teachers' association. - Oh, Mr. Callahan, - Hmm? I think Miss Baxter's trying to attract your attention. We'll start a petition, get thousands and thousands and thousands of names. - Swell! Great idea! - Boy! Demanding that bail be granted so an innocent babe can be born in God's great outdoors. You mean in the woods? - No, not bail, for immediate trial. - Oh, swell, Mary. - Jake. - Yeah. I think Miss Baxter wishes to speak with you. - She probably has a scoop for you. - Hiya, Gertie. - Just a minute. - Who's that dame! Scram, sister! Upstairs, Gertie. This is private. Scat! Ahh, poor Miss Baxter. She seems to live such a lonely life. - I've got it! Oh, I've got it! - Yeah? We'll demand that the trial start on Mother's Day. - Wonderful, Mary! - Swell idea. But I'm the father. Don't you understand? I'm the father! Ain't there any room at all for the father? How many people did the state charge with the shooting of Casely? One. How many did the grand jury indict? One. How many are named in the charge? One. - Then how can the state try two? - That's a mighty pretty question, Counselor. Yeah. Don't you worry, my dear. The American public will fight to the death for you and your wee one. But will we beat the rap? That's the rancid test. Every true woman in the country will be with you spiritually, Mrs. Hart. Motherhood itself will be at stake. You've been so kind, Miss Sunshine. If it's a girl, I'd like to name it after you. Oh, you darling! Oh, that is just too sweet. And if it's a boy, after you, Jake. No, not me, honey. Thanks just the same. You slip it to Billy here. Well, I... I appreciate the honor, naturally... but I happen to be married, and happily, and would like to remain so. Mr. Flynn, Mr. Hart's outside making quite a fuss. - He's got a crust. - He wants to make it up with her. Over my dead body! He turned on her, and he's gotta stay turned on her. He can't switch back and forth like that. I'll never get a defense set. - Shall I tell them to throw him out? - No, I'll see him. We can't allow him to have any sympathy at all. He's got to be the heavy throughout. I'll have to get him to divorce you. - If you don't lay off me, so help me... - I just want to give you a cigar, that's all. - Look, from you, I wouldn't take Clara Bow. - Be with you in a minute, paperboy. - Take your time. - Mr. Flynn, the cigars are on me this time. Well, Hart, I congratulate you. Thanks, old man. That's the way to take it. Be a good sport about it. - Came as quite a surprise too, you know. - What does that matter? The whole affair was obviously somewhat awkward. You're a man of the word, aren't you? Yes, but what do you mean, "Be a good sport"? Exactly. Now, I'm a bit older than you are, Hart. Sit down. And I've seen such situations arise before... and the only way to take them is philosophically. - Just laugh it off, that's all. - Laugh? Yes. No matter what they say to you, just laugh at them. Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you look like a chump. Maybe I better hold on to this for a little while yet. - What's the matter? - Maybe I ain't as big a chump as I look. - Hart, you're not going to be a cad. - Who says I ain't? Nobody can't make a fool out of me, you know. You amaze me. You talk as if you were going to divorce her. - Maybe that ain't all. - What do you mean? You think you're so smart, the both of you. But, I know what you're figuring! You're figuring if the going gets too tough... you're gonna call in Finnegan, and he'll clear her and hang it on me. Well, you ain't. And you know why you ain't? Because Finnegan is dead. Yeah! Last week. He had another stroke, and he's dead! - Finnegan? Who is Finnegan? - Not is, was. Who was Finnegan? Just tell her that, Mr. Wise Guy and see what she says. He's dead. Finnegan is dead! Is that the way them big-shot lawyers go at a case? That's the way Mr. Billy Flynn went at one. You'd think they'd throw him out of the courts. They did. Skullduggery in the first degree. All right, go on, Homer. I wanna hear what you've got to say about the trial. The day of the big game dawned crisp and clear. This account of the Roxie Hart trial, ladies and gentlemen... comes to you through the courtesy of Dr. Habakuk Twist... president and founder of the Twist Health Institute... who guarantees to cure you of cancer, dropsy, gout... Bright's disease, lumbago, rheumatism, or sleeping sickness... or any combination of such diseases in five days by mail. Your play-by-play announcer for the trial... will be that veteran crime expert of the Daily Gazette, Mr. Jake Callahan. Take it away, Jake Callahan. Now, uh, at that point, you weep. - I just wept. - Well, then weep again... and every other time I say so! I may not know much law, but I do know juries, and that's all we need. Where was I? Mmm. My innocent unborn babe. Yeah. On that, you throw your head back... nobly. Good. But don't look at the jury on that. Just forget 'em. Seek the eyes of your husband. He has divorced me and cast me aside... but he is still the father of my child. - "And the man I really love." - And the man I really love. - Well, you don't have to go down to the floor! - You said slump, didn't you? But gently, delicately, like a lady. You were going on like a sea lion. - Now, the cross-examination. - He better watch his step, that Harrison. - If he starts calling me names, I'll crown him. - Just cry! Now listen. No matter what he says or how mad he gets, you shrink. Shrink! And cower. And cry... with a little flutter. Until the jury wants to rise up and tear him limb from limb! And never forget... always you're frightened and helpless and demure. Demure, I said. Don't you know what demure means? - Certainly. - What? - What? - Demure means shy... timid, modest. Oh. His Honor's here, Counselor. - Now, don't get excited. - I'm not excited. Let me look at you. Turn around. Here are your flowers. Now take it easy. And now, folks, it looks like... Yes, it is, here she comes now... Roxie Hart, that game little sharpshooter. - Boy! - Oh, Roxie, let's see your kisser. Hey, Bill, what's with the geraniums? Okay, here we go. Open... flash! That done it. Darling, we're all for you. You've got to come through. Listen you. This dame is alone, deserted, forsaken and forlorn. Cut out this foolishness till she's free. All right, Bill. Hold it. Open. Flash! - And... - Roxie, will you say a word or two to America? Hello, America. Hello, Ma, uhm... Mrs. Hart and I have nothing to say except that win or lose... we expect to play the game fair and square... and let the court decide on the plain, unvarnished facts. - That's fine. - That, ladies and gentlemen... was Roxie Hart and Billy Flynn, her simple, barefoot mouthpiece. And now here comes Judge Canton. Look here. Hold it. Open. Flash! The honorable court is in session. Now, folks, the preliminaries are over, and we have a jury... a blue-ribbon jury, men of property, brokers or better... and they haven't had their eyes off Roxie since they sat down. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. No, sir, I didn't do it. Amos Hart, take the stand. All right, let's take a shot of this. Hold it still a minute. Just hold it. Okay. Hold it. Open. Flash. That did it. All right, fellas. Break it up. Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Will Your Honor kindly request the jury to give some small attention... - to the witness during this testimony? - I, uh... Certainly, certainly. Pay attention to the witness, gentlemen. - What's your name? - Amos Hart. What is your relationship to the defendant, Roxie Hart? She used to be my wife. Mr. Hart, will you tell the court, in your own words... what, if anything, happened in the apartment occupied by you and your ex-wife... - on the evening of September 5? - Well, sir... on the evening of September 5, I arrived at my home... 1442 South Melrose, apartment six, from the poolroom where I hang out... at 1726 South Hoffman Boulevard at 7:17 p.m. And what did you find, Mr. Hart? I found Mrs. Hart shooting a man. Hold it! Hold it! Nice, big smile. All right. That's good. Everybody, all right, hold it. Open. Flash! That did it! All right. Break it up, fellas. Why don't you sit down right now and write a nice, long letter to Dr. Habakuk Twist... and tell him about your gallstones. - Tell us the details, Mr. Hart. - Well, sir, I come up the stairs, and blam! I heard this pistol shot in my apartment. So, I bust in and there she was, banging away at this Casely fella. Bang, bang, bang, bang! - Bang? - No, sir. Just four bangs and the one I heard on the stairs. Five bangs altogether. Well, how do you like that? Did she speak? Was she saying anything? Yes, sir. She kept saying, "Take that, you cur, and that and that!" Can you beat it? I never said "cur" in my life. Your Honor, I protest against these interruptions. The defendant will keep quiet, please. - Did you say anything? - Yes, sir. I said, "Roxie, you ought not to be shooting that man like that." - In other words, you protested. - Yes, sir. - And that was about what time? - 7:19. 7:20, wasn't it? He said 7:19. I must insist, Your Honor, that counsel for the defense... And I am as insistent, Your Honor, that this witness give a good performance. - Gentlemen! Gentlemen! - I resent that implication. - Ahh, if the witness needs more rehearsal... - Take that back! Gentlemen, gentlemen! Your witness. - When did you file suit for divorce, Mr. Hart? - October the 15th. Was there any particular reason for your filing suit on this exact date? Well, sir, the papers came out with a story that... well, a statement that... well, there was going to be a little stranger. - Mr. Hart, is this grounds for divorce? - A little too much of a stranger. - But they couldn't put anything over on you. - I'll say they couldn't. Had your wife apprised you of her condition prior to said statement? - How's that? - Had your wife told you of this... - this stranger? - No, sir. Neither one of them. Now tell us, Mr. Hart, do you expect this jury to believe that... with all due respect to the press... that our courts would grant you a divorce merely on a newspaper story? No, sir. I had a statement that she'd made and signed herself. - All about her and this... - Where did you get the statement? - From him. - I protest, Your Honor! So, the state prosecutor... gave you a statement that enabled you to cast aside... the woman that you had sworn to love and cherish for better or worse. And what, Mr. Hart, did you give the state prosecutor in return? This is too much!I resent these infamous allegations! - A deal was made! - Take that back! I repeat, a thieves' bargain was made. A forged statement! In exchange for this man's lying testimony! Why, you cheap double-crossing shyster! No man can call me that and live! Come on, Mike. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Open. Flash! That did it. Break it up, fellas. Listen, Mr. Flynn. A photo finish may be good enough for you... but for me, anything less than eight lengths is too close! That's a hanging district attorney out there. I tell you, there is no occasion whatever for alarm. All we need is one juror, and already I've got that number-one guy... that big Irish foreman, right there. The worst we can get is a hung jury. Or a hung Roxie. That's not good enough. So far, I've been doing exactly... what Jake and that agent said... let you carry the ball. But I don't like that D.A. I'm scared of him. Oh, listen, listen. Give me time, will you? Listen, Mr. Flynn. The way I'm beginning to feel about my neck... I want you to get a fella in here by the name of Finnegan... Michael Finnegan. Get him fast, 'cause we need him and I ain't kiddin'! - Finnegan? Finnegan? - Finnegan the janitor. Put him on the stand and ask him who he sold his gun to. Ask him what Amos said on that very morning. Ask him, ask him! - Mr. Flynn! - Not a chance, buddy! But it's important, I tell you! - You can't see anybody now. - Roxie! Are you her lover or a newspaperman? We got the biggest story of the century in our mitts. Listen, if this dame swings, it'll be a story you could tell your grandchildren about. Why, you ghoul! Finnegan could tell him that that very morning... Roxie, we can't get Finnegan. Of course you can. - What do you mean? - He's dead. Dead? Uh-uh, nah, he can't be. He's dead. He's been dead for two weeks. We gotta do it my way. He can't be! He can't do that to me! I've been depending on him. He heard him say it. He sold him the gun. He's the only one who... Listen, I didn't do it. I never had anything to do with him! He was drunk, but I could got him. I could have handled him. He didn't have to shoot him! Finnegan can tell him. - Don't you understand? - Roxie! Roxie! It's important, Roxie! I talked to that janitor. - I... I interviewed him. - Finnegan? You did? Let him in, Mike. Mr. Howard, on the day after the killing of Fred Casely... did you have a conversation with one Michael Finnegan... janitor of the apartment house in which the Harts lived? - Yes, sir. - Tell us what was said. - When I talked to him... - Your Honor, I object... to the witness answering on this question on the grounds it would be hearsay. Why wasn't this man Finnegan brought here himself to tell what he knows? Well, he's dead, Your Honor. He died two weeks ago. Was there any other witness to the conversation? - No, sir. - Objection sustained. - You mean I can't... - I object Your Honor, to any further remarks... for this witness. - The witness will leave the stand. - But this is important! - It has an important bearing on... - Such testimony is inadmissible. - Leave the stand at once, sir. - Step down, Mr. Howard. The jury will disregard everything that was said by the witness. You see, in New York or Los Angeles or some other sissy town... that'd be the end of it. Nothing but law. But in Chicago, the law doesn't count. It's justice we're after. What do you say, kid? - I'm scared. - You can do it, you know. They're gonna hang me. Roxie, you know who's sitting out front there? I don't care. I'm scared. - Ziegfeld. - I don't ca... - Who? - Ziegfeld... the greatest musical producer in the world. No kid. Mrs. Hart, take the stand. Hold it! All right! Hold it! Hold it, Roxie. Let's take a nice one now. Big smile, honey. That's it. Open. Flash! That did it. All right, fellas, break it up. Oh, I got a pip. Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth and nothing but the truth? Yeah, I do. No drugs, no surgery, no down payment. - Were do you live, Mrs. Hart? - County jail. - When did you first meet Fred Casely? - Ten minutes past 5:00, January 8. - Where? - At a bus stop. Tell the jury the circumstances. Well, it was rainin', and I was standin' there with my girlfriend. Mr. Casely drove up in his coupe and says, "It's a nice day for ducks". - And we said, "Yes." - Both of you? She said it first, and then I said it. And then he said could he drive us somewhere and... well, you know how crowded the buses are. So, you said yes. Well, she said it first, and then I said it. - And so he drove you home. - Yes, sir. How did Mr. Casely conduct himself during this drive... unusually friendly in any way? Oh, no, sir. He was a perfect gent in every sense of the word. All he said was, wouldn't I like to have a screen test. - When was the next time you saw him? - The next day. It rained again. Would you say, then, that, uh, Casely was now pursuing you? I'll say! Other than these innocent rides home in the rain... did you ever have any social engagements with this man Casely? - Yes, sir. Once. - And that was? The Policeman's Benefit Ball. He asked you to go to this ball and you consented... - although you were married, Roxie? - Yes, sir. You believe in the sacredness of the marriage tie, don't you? I object, Your Honor! What the witness believes is immaterial. You know that the marriage tie is sacred, don't you? Oh, yes, sir. That's what I kept tellin' him all along. Tell us, then, why you went to the policeman's ball that night with this man Casely. Oh, I don't know. So many things happen, you don't know why. I wouldn't have if my... Mr. Hart and me hadn't quarreled that morning. Oh, Roxie! And who was to blame? Me, I guess. - It seemed like I couldn't stop pesterin' him. - Pestering him? What about? Because I wanted a home, a real home with little kiddies. - That's why! - Hold it! Hold it! - Hold it! - Hold it, Roxie. That's it. Get in a little closer. That's it, talkin' to the kiddies. I said hold it. Open. Flash! That did it. All right. Break it up, fellas. Now, uh, what happened at the policeman's ball? He gave me a drink. Really? What kind of a drink? Oh. I don't know. It just tasted bad... nasty... kaaa! If that's what whiskey is... ugh! That is just the kind of loose talk that is giving whiskey a bad name. Did Casely misunderstand your, uh, ambition to put your talents on the stage? Oh, yes, indeed, sir. Roxie Hart! The state charges you with the murder of Fred Casely. - Guilty or not guilty? - Not guilty! Oh, not guilty! Not guilty. I may have killed him, yes. But not murder! Oh, not that! Do you remember Friday, September 5? Yes, sir. Tell the jury now in your own way... the happenings of that day in the late afternoon. Now, take your time and speak clearly. Well, that afternoon at Mr. Casely's request... I went to his office and gave an audition for a Mr. Marcus. - What kind of an audition, my dear? - I did the black hula. The black hula? It's a mixture of the hula hula and the Black Bottom. - I invented it myself. - That's enough. Continue. So when I finished, Mr. Marcus turned to Mr. Casely and said... - "Are you kidding?" and walked out. - Go on. So I took the Cottage Grove car to South Melrose... and stopped at a grocer's to buy some baking powder for some biscuits for breakfast. He loved my biscuits. - And this was about what time? - 6:11 p.m. So I was singing about my housework when the doorbell rang... - and thinking it was my girlfriend, Irma... - Never mind what you thought. I went to the door, and who do you think it was? - Casely? - It wasn't his uncle. And, oh, was he intoxicated. So I said, "Go away, Mr. Casely. You are intoxicated." But do you think he paid any attention to that? He entered? He forced his way into my presence. Now, now, now, now, be strong, my dear. Bear up. So I said, "You certainly got a crust, Mr. Casely. And please beat it. "Cause how do you think this is going to look to my... to my husband." - And he still wouldn't go? - Well, he was really crocked. - I mean, intoxicated. - Well, why didn't you scream? Oh, I was ashamed for the neighbors to know. Well, you know how you'd feel. But I kept sayin' to him we could easy get into a jam here. So, finally, he said if I'd just take one drink with him, he'd beat it. - So I did. - And then? Oh, he was really simply insane about me, you know. - But you... - Oh, I loved my husband. I really did. And when you told him that, what did he say? Nothing. He just grabbed me. And where were you at this time? Uh, standing by the pianola. Show the jury. Take it easy. Here. - And Casely? - On the floor... uh, by the door. Roxie, tell the jury... what happened next. Well, it just happened that Mr. Hart's revolver was laying on the telephone table. And Mr. Casely made a grab for it, and I said, "Cut that out, Mr. Casely!" And I knocked it out of his hand. It fell on the floor and we both grabbed for it. - We both grabbed for it. - Yes? I got it, and then he started for me. I can see him now with that awful look in his eye. A wild look. What kind of a look? Describe it to the audience, uh, to the jury. Oh, it was terrible... angry, like a crazy man. - Did you think he might kill you? - Oh, yes, sir. - I know if once he got that gun... - It was his life or yours. Oh, yes, sir. But he still kept comin' toward me. On and on with that awful look, that wild look. - And then I shut my eyes. - Go on, Roxie. - And then I fired. - In defense of your life! My life, yes. But not just mine. Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! All right. Get in a little closer. All right, everybody. Hold it! Open! Flash! That did it. Break it up. Do you suffer from spots before the eyes? Now, here's where you weep. You may take her life, gentlemen, as the state asks. But that won't bring Casely back. Hmm. That's always news to a jury. And for what purpose, to protect society? Well, weep you fool! Open your mouth. Give me that gum. Give me that gum! You may take her life, gentlemen, as the state asks, But that won't bring Casely back. And for what purpose, to protect society? Do you fear that weeping girl? - Do you? - No. - Do you? - No. For her reformation? She learned her lesson, gentlemen... in those dark hours, alone in her cell. For punishment? Great heavens, gentlemen. Hasn't she been punished enough? No. None of these. But to satisfy the greedy ambition of the prosecution. Prosecution? No. Persecution! You are asked for a life, gentlemen... by one who would climb to fame on dead bodies. We cannot give her happiness now. It is too late for that. Betrayed, crushed... we can only let her pick up the broken fragments of her life, the tangled threads. We can give her another chance. Quiet. Gentlemen, if you convict this delicate child it would be like taking these fragile flowers... and crushing them into dead and broken blossoms. No! No! Oh, no! Oh, n... Stand back, gentlemen! - The defense rests, Your Honor. - Hold it! Hold it, Bill! That's fine! A little this way! That's right, Bill! All right now. Everybody, hold it! Open! Flash! That did it! They're ready, boys. Boy! The defendant please rise. "We, the jury, find the defendant..." Heya, Roxie Hart... Thank you! Thank you! Thank you all of my dear, dear friends. If a man jumps into your home, you got a right to protect your home, haven't ya? - Sure! Sure! - All I know is, the judge said bring you in. - You tell him all about it. - But if you find a man in your home... you got a right to do something about it! Jake! Jake! Hey, wait a minute, Jake! I'm sorry, kid. It's all over! You're yesterday's news! - Did you shoot Casely? - Yes, but I couldn't... Then have no fear. Justice will prevail if we have to take your case... to the Supreme Court of the United States. The whole thing is persecution. A deal was made! Open! Flash! That did it! - Well, for cryin' out loud. - Oh, Roxie, I can't tell you how happy I am. They never even let me thank 'em. When they didn't come in for so long... oh, darling... You're free now, you know. We can go out, have dinner together... see a show, be together, dance together... Mrs. Hart, I just want to congratulate you. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. - I don't want too be too forward... but could I give you a lift somewhere in my Packard? - Packard? - Roxie. What a dame. What a dame! So that was Roxie, gents, and the bad old days. - Drink her down. - The bad old days. What a dame. - Hey, Homer. - Okay. Good night, gentlemen. - Thanks a lot. - Roxie Hart. - And thank you too. - What a dame. - Good night to you, Mr. O'Malley. - Good night. - You still got that Packard? - No. - Gone, huh? - 1929, and everything with it. Gee, that's too bad. Awful. A nice big car like that. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Much obliged. The wife sore? Well, you said you'd pick her up two hours ago, you know. Did I? Well, I'll see you tomorrow. - Good evening, Mrs. Howard. - Hi, Daddy. Hand Ritchie right over here. Here. - Darling. - Yes, dear. I got some news for ya. We're gonna have to have a bigger car next year.
