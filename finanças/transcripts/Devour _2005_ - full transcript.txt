Where'd you get this? Later. Oh, happy birthday. Joseph Campbell believed that the power of myth related to certain intrinsic, universal values found in all cultures. The need to worship God, to protect family, to co-exist in harmony with nature. You know, from these very ideas, stories were created, and passed down from one generation to another, each having its own central hero character. Wanna see what you missed? [teacher] ...travails and sacrifice... If I wanted to see it, I wouldn't have missed it. [teacher] Campbell termed this ennobled path... - Just trying to be helpful. - What a shame. I thought you wanted to get in my pants. It is my birthday. Works for me. [teacher] We are but little more than stories we grow up hearing, and the tradition of telling them binds together even the most disparate. [laughing] Happy birthday, handsome. [laughing] - How's it feel to be 21? - Like I'm on the verge of nothing. Mr. Gray. Am I interrupting a celebration? Sorry, Professor Hartney. Tell me, Dakota. What are we to make of this Dionysian offering? - [sighs] Mimosas. - [laughter] All right. That's enough for today. Thank you. [chuckles] - We're drinking this tonight? - We'll be doing a lot more than that. Dakota. In my office in 30 minutes. Get me out of this town. [beeping] [phone ringing] You must be Jake. Yeah, how'd you know that? Hey, Jake, this lady needs help with her laptop. [laughs] OK. Uh, what's the problem? [laughs] It just stopped working. - They do that. - [phone rings] OK, let's see. Oh. That's what it looks like in there. - What'd you expect? - Lots of little guys running around - doing my errands for me. - [chuckles] OK. - You got some red wax. - [laughs] Wax. - My tarot cards. - Sorry? I burn candles when I read tarot. They help you see into the future, right? Yeah. And the past. OK. It works. - What do I owe you? - Oh, no charge. - Really? - Yeah. That's so nice. Thank you. [man] Uh, Jake. You could have got 75 bucks for that job. - It's a piece of wax. - Yeah? Well, I'm docking your salary. - What the hell for? - Because your time is my money. And please, watch your fucking language. [clears throat] Aren't you gonna blow it out? You gonna sing me Happy Birthday? I stopped singing the day they kicked me out of the church choir. - Did you go see your mother? - Uh, no, she wasn't feeling well today, so I'll go see her tomorrow. How are things going at the mill? Still got a job. They'd have to close the place down if they got rid of you. Thanks. You, uh, going out tonight with Conrad and Dakota? - I'm legal. - They look up to you, Jake.

Jake, what's our zip code? 98133. - Had you heard that one? - Personally, - I found it depressing. - That's 'cause you weren't there. Exactly. What year were you born? - Same as you, dumbass. - [Dakota clears throat] So what's your weirdest family holiday? Fuck that. We'll be here all night. What was your weirdest family holiday? [laughs] Thanksgiving, couple of years ago. I was building a ramp for my mom's wheelchair. And Father Moore came by to visit. And they were all inside watching football. Dallas-Tampa game. Dallas lost. That was your weirdest family holiday? So I had a hammer in my hand, and I look up and Father Moore is smiling at me. And all I can think about is just bashing his head in. Just over and over. Then I smash my parents' heads in. Then like half the people I knew, just... So I started thinking, like, "Wow, what else would I like to do?" All this crazy shit came into my head. So then what happened? I finished the ramp. We ate turkey. [laughs] Dude, that's sick. - Even for me. - Dude, I've castrated my dad, like, 112 times. - In my dreams. [Laughs] - Three of a kind, huh? Let's play a real fucked-up game. "Welcome to The Pathway." [laughing] The Pathway! Mmm. I've never played this before. - Dakota, it's a secret. - Huh? Well, it's not a very good secret if you know about it. - [laughs] - Serious. You give it your phone numbers and stuff, then it calls you and gives you bizarre things to do. - What kind of bizarre things? - Well, you don't know unless you play. - How do you start? - You already have. - Happy birthday. - [beeps] Oh, shit. That's, like, my entire life. Wild or what? Dude, you'll never be president. [laughs] Turn this off. Somebody could be reading this. Nobody cares about the $243 you have left in your bank account.

I'll get you a blanket. Hang on. Excuse me, nurse. Can we get a blanket for my...? - Marisol. - Jake! - What are you doing here? - Hey. [mother] You two know each other? Yeah, she came into the computer shop. - Jake saved my life. - It was just a circuit board. Wow. Oh, so you're the one that brings Kathy the orchids. Yeah. Wow. Um, you wanted a blanket? - I'll get you a blanket. - Thanks for the cards. - You're welcome. - Small world, huh? Yeah. I like it that way, though. Ooh-hoo-hoo! Behave, Mom.

I fired this kid yesterday, he comes back here last night and he rips me off. I just came by to get my money. He owes me two weeks pay. - Were you in here last night? - No. OK. All right. You know what? Check out the hidden surveillance cameras. We'll see what we see. Didn't know we had those, did you, Jake? Look, I'm just gonna start this from when I left last night. What the...? That can't be me. You doctored the tape. You little prick. Don't you see? He's goddamn smart. You screwed me, Gray! How'd you do it, huh? How'd you do it? So then who were those guys in the video tape? I don't know. That's why I'm trying to hack into the site. Well, whoever they are, I wouldn't piss them off. Yeah. Shit. Since when are you into voodoo? They're spiritual interpretations of universal ideas. - What it said on the box. - [laughs] So what did it have to say about these guys? Um... Well... The figures suggest youth, love and virginity before they're corrupted by desire. Remember taking my virginity? If I recall, I think it was you that took mine. Details. Details. Should we light a candle or something? [moaning] So much for cuddling. Well, Jake, you got what you wanted, and I get to keep playing The Pathway. You just made love to me because The Pathway told you to? No, Jake, I fucked you because The Pathway told me to. When did you start playing The Pathway? Like you care. Like you've ever really given a shit about me, Jake. Like any man ever has. See you on campus. [phone rings] - Hello? - [man] Feeling distracted? Beats watching TV. Are you ready for another test? I thought that was Dakota's test. Besides, it's not exactly our first time. With her in control it was. I thought the point was to entertain me. No. The point was to see what's inside your head. [voices muttering] [whispering] [roaring] [baby crying] [heart beating] [grunts] [distorted heartbeats] - [father] Hey. - [gasps] Dinner's ready. Trying to break my hand? What's the matter? You pull something? Just throw the goddamn ball. [grunts] Let me see. Let me see. - Darius do that? - With a little help. Damn it, Conrad, I can't baby-sit you day and night. Who asked you to? Don't give me that. Been covering your back since we were nine. Why don't you stop already? OK. Sorry, man. I think I'm building up a resistance to my medication. Yeah, we're both losing it. Listen to this shit. The other night, in the basement, I get a phone call from The Pathway. I turn around, there's a big creature staring at me. - A creature. - Half-man, half-woman. So I have this dream where I go upstairs, and I shoot my dad in the back of the head. Has trippy stuff like that been happening to you? Every goddamn day. Great. - I'll take it easy on you. - Right. [phone rings] - Hello? - [Conrad] Jakey. Got, uh, two girls in my room. - I can't get them to leave. - Nice, man. - Why didn't you give a shout? - Like I'm gonna have you by. They would have taken one look at you and kicked my ass out of bed. [Jake laughs] - Is something wrong? - I don't know. I'm spent. - You know. - Be careful. Um, why don't we get breakfast in the morning. OK. I'll call you in the morning. - Hey, Jake. - Yeah. Fuck you. [phone rings] Dude, what the fuck do you want now? [man] Nobody knows how fucked up you really are. And nobody really gives a fuck, do they? [shouting] [roaring] [industrial music playing] [moaning] - Fuck! - [girl screams] Connie. Connie, let's go get some breakfast, bud. More like lunch. Connie! Wake up! [police radio chatter] Uncle Ross. He didn't sound good. I should have come over. No. You could have wound up dead too. - Conrad wasn't a psychopath. - He was always on the edge. This thing with Darius just pushed him over it. All those guys would fight one day and get high the next. I'm sure their parents will be comforted to hear that. Did you help Conrad steal that gun? - What? - The serial numbers match a .38 stolen from Sid's Sporting Goods last week. - That's impossible. - Why's that? Because I threw that gun into Cove Lake. - You what? - I took a gun from Connie. I didn't want him to get in trouble, so I threw it in the lake. How would Conrad have gotten the gun back? - He couldn't have. - This is a bad time to lie. I'm not lying to you! You think I don't wanna find out what went on in there? You gonna tell my sister or am I? [sighs] Yeah, I wanna go to the hospital now if I can. I'm your uncle. You... You could've brought the gun to me. - You OK? - It's the worst day of my life. You wanna talk about it? - Not here. - Meet me in front in five minutes, OK? - OK. - OK. [Jake] I just don't wanna end up like my father. Go to work at six, come home at eight, do it all again the next day. What do you wanna do? - I wish I knew. - Ever thought about leaving here? - Who'd bring my mom orchids? - I'm sure she'd love postcards. Yeah. Looks like you like to travel. Yeah. I like collecting things. - How'd you end up here? - A man. - Sorry, didn't mean to pry. - [laughs] No, it's OK. - I'm just enjoying this one too much. - [laughs] Yeah. So how about you? You seeing anybody? Took you long enough to ask. [laughs] I take that as a no. No. But who knows? I could always run into someone when I'm not expecting it. That never happens. What timing. All I wanna do is leave this town, and you just got here. We just have to meet somewhere in the middle. OK. Well, you were right. The day did get better.. I'm sorry about your friend. So I'm gonna try and play it cool and not call you for at least an hour, OK? [laughs] OK. - Bye, Jake. - Bye. [laughs] I remember when you and Connie first met in Sunday school. [chuckles] - You're drinking? - Well, I'm not praying. You're gonna throw away five years just like that? You think I don't know what you and Conrad have been doing to yourselves, son? - You think I don't know? - What Conrad did has nothing to do with me. He's gone to hell. I don't have to listen to this. Wait just a minute, Jake. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. We're not... We're not gonna be able to save you now. Don't preach to me with a drink in your hand, Dad. You ungrateful punk. Do you realize that we have sacrificed everything for you here? Sacrificed? You sacrificed? I could have gone anywhere, done anything, but I stayed here for you, I stayed here for Mom. What did you ever give up for me? - My beautiful wife. - What does that mean? I thought I could do this, but I can't do this. Thought you could do what, huh? What are you trying to tell me? You trying to blame me for the way Mom is? For the accident? Wanna blame me for that? The day after my best friend kills himself, you're gonna blame me for that? It's not very much, though, Jake. You know, the day I need you the most, the day I need help, the day I need my father, you do this? Shame on you. Jake? [Dakota] I don't know whether to cry or scream. I know what you mean. You know, I called you like six times. I'm really sorry about what happened the other night. - Don't worry about it. - [sighs] So why didn't you call me back? I was hanging out with a friend. Who is she? Her name is Marisol. - Sounds exotic. - It's just different. - I'm super late. - Dakota. Hey. You heard what Conrad did to himself, right? I can't stop thinking about it. The other night, after I got off the phone with The Pathway, I had a dream where I did the same thing to myself. You think that The Pathway has something to do with what Conrad did to himself? Yeah, maybe. Are you still playing? It hasn't asked me to corrupt anyone else, if that's what you're asking. - All right, do me a favor. - Anything. Stop. Sure. Come by The Tomahawk tonight. Dinner's on me. And bring your friend. You're sure you want company tonight? No, but I like being with you. Good. OK. Now I'm jealous. - Marisol, this is Dakota. - Nice to meet you. God, Marisol. That's such a beautiful name. - Thank you. - What does it mean? It's Spanish for "sun and sea." Oh, my parents named me for where I was conceived. You know, I would really love to stay here and chat with you, but my boss is totally riding my ass. It's OK. We're just gonna do takeout. So two burgers, two fries and two beers. - We're not staying? - No. I got a surprise for you. Oh. Now this would be the part where I get ill. Sorry, just looking for the men's room. You know where the men's room is, Professor. - You eat here twice a week. - So have you thought about our little conversation after class? Professor, you twist that ring any harder, and your finger's gonna come off. I got plenty more. - Oh! - Asshole! [phone rings] Tomahawk. - [Woman] Even Hartney knows you're weak. Every man does. Why do you think Jake would never be with you for more than one night? He knows you fucked all his friends. Who wants a girl like that? I know, it wasn't your fault. Daddy was a monster. But then, let's face it. Lots of girls have bad fathers and they don't end up like you. Get used to it. You let Hartney fuck you over, and you're gonna be working in dumps like this for the rest of your miserable life. - Is that what you want? - Fuck you! Fuck all of you! That's my girl. Didn't that feel good? Don't you understand that I wanna help you? Make you feel better? Help you get even with Hartney before it's too late? Yes. Don't be afraid. It's time to play. [screeching] When I was nine months old, my folks moved here from Seattle to be near my uncle, my mother's brother. There was a blizzard and my dad lost control of the car. It was a miracle any of us survived. There's a higher power looking out for you. Is she OK? I'll call her later. We're late. - Late for what? - [buzzing] [industrial music plays] [laughs] It's so worth the pain. I promise. I need some more medicine, nurse. - Ready? - Yeah.

You could be next. I am not gonna let that happen. All right, can you... Can you take him home? Make sure he gets some sleep. Jake, listen to me. First thing tomorrow morning, you meet me at my cabin. No one will disturb us there. But we're not leaving until you tell me everything you know. Uncle Ross? Ross! Nine points, huh? Oh, hey. Didn't hear you drive in. So how you holding up? - Fine. - Yeah? - What's in the ground? - Oh. After a hunt, we bury the animal's remains. Native American ritual I taught Jake when he was a kid. Returns the animal's soul to the Earth. Well, come on in. When we started, The Pathway was a game that had the ability of knowing what we were thinking. But then Conrad used the gun that I threw into the lake, and then cuts his tongue off the way that I did after a beast in a dream tells me to. So I'm thinking maybe it wasn't a dream. Maybe it isn't just a game. I feel like I'm going insane. No. No, I think you're just looking for an answer for something so horrible, it has none. I like it here. It's peaceful. Thanks. Well, I have to meet the FBI in my office in a couple of hours. I'll ask them to check on this computer game of yours. Why don't you spend the night here? It might do you some good. [phone rings] Sheriff North. [growling] What is it? Something's wrong. I'm sorry. I think... we ought to go. OK. - Jake, talk to me. - Oh, shit. [screams] Oh, my God! Come on! [grunting] Come on! [shouting] [priest] Give rest, O Christ, to your servant with your saints. Where sorrow and pain are no more. Neither sighing, but life everlasting. You only are immortal, the creator and maker of all. We are mortal, formed of the Earth. And to the Earth we shall return. For so did you ordain when you created us, saying, "You are dust and to dust you shall return." All of us go down to the dust. Yet even at the grave, we make our song. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You... You know, you say there's a higher power looking out for me. Well, I need him now. He's not here. Come here. - [sniffles] - Mmm. Jake, what is it? I have to go see an old friend. [man] Jacob, why this sudden interest in Satan? Do you think he really exists? Many in the Church take the devil quite literally, but, uh, I think of him as a symbol of temptation, not as a beast with a pitchfork and horns. - [growling] - [buzzing] What does it say in the Bible about possession or self-mutilation? You think your two friends were possessed? Maybe. In Mark, uh, nine... 25. "When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene," he rebuked the evil spirit. 'You deaf and mute spirit, ' he said. "'I command you to come out of him.'" [Walt sighs] Again, sorry about your friend. Thanks. So when did you stop worshipping Satan? Ten years ago. I'm a Christian now. It's more forgiving. Why'd you even start? Some folks want what God ain't giving them. Money, power. Me? I wanted to get laid. [laughs] There's more pussy at a black mass than there is at a Metallica concert. - What happens at a black mass? - People get naked. Then they sacrifice something. A cat or a dog. Satan rewards you for killing a dog? The more you give, the more you get. What happens if you kill a human? Hey, my group was more bankers and housewives looking for a different kind of picnic. Do you know any people that are more devoted? You don't cross people who are willing to give up their souls. Walt, please. Yeah, I know a guy. Just do me a favor. Don't tell him I sent ya. - [dog barking] - [man] Coming. Samuel. Mr. Reisz, I'm Jake Gray. I called about an hour ago, said I was coming by. Oh. Yeah. I get $50 an hour for consultations. Right. I should charge more. The guy who fixes my car gets 80. Barely knows where the spark plugs are, much less how to conjure up Beelzebub. I ever sell books to you before? No. You say it's called The Pathway. Yes, why? That's what we call the connection between the devil - and the possessed. - So how did I resist? We're often unaware of our strength until we're tested. Why does the devil need to use computers or games? Think about it. It's a very effective way to spread a message. I mean, imagine if Hitler had had the Internet. Maybe Satan's found someone to do his bidding again. I've seen this man. - In my head. - So have I. What makes you think he can conjure Satan? Because I taught him to. When Aiden Kater came to me to learn the black arts, he was a geek living out of the back of his van. I stopped teaching a few years later, but by then, he was very skilled. - Why did you stop? - I was going to be a father. Was? [Reisz] Anne Kilton was a student of mine before we were married. The pregnancy was hard on her. She had a bad premonition. Asked me to perform a sacrifice for the health of the baby. A human sacrifice. - I refused. - So Kater took your place. I came home one night and found a pentagram in my yard. There was blood everywhere. I thought, at first, Anne must have sacrificed some animal. But Anne was gone too. When they found her bloody clothes in a ditch two days later, I knew... ...Aiden Kater had sacrificed my wife and unborn child. - I'm sorry. - [sighs] What did the police say? Police were very helpful. They made me their prime suspect. I spent the next five years trying to prove I didn't do it. And that's what I have left to remember them by. An empty grave. The devil uses The Pathway to possess people. And then forces them to kill and commit suicide? She seduces them. - The devil's a woman? - I don't know. It can be whatever it needs to be. Or what you want it to be? I didn't want it to be a woman. You think Conrad and Dakota wanted to die like that? - Some part of them did. - You don't even know them! I'm not saying it's your fault. I just think you're angry... Yes, I'm angry! My friends are dead! I'm angry! But I'm not crazy. This Kater guy is behind this, and I gotta do something. I can't stand here! What are you gonna do? Throw holy water on him? - Burn him at the stake? - You believed I saw something. I did! I believed that you had a vision, maybe, or an apparition. The bitch was in my basement! OK. You know what? This is getting a little bit too heavy for me right now. It's... It's... I adore you, but this is too much. I guess I shouldn't have come here. - I'm sorry. - Fucking shit. I'm not gonna be able to save you now. [priest] You are dust, and to dust you shall return. He's gone to hell. Where you going with those, Jake? To your mother and father? You can't do that, man. You'll ruin everything. [grunts] Jake. I didn't have a choice. Neither of us do. - Are we in hell? - No. But hell ain't so bad. You'll see. [faint roaring] [echoing screams] You know, you remind me of myself when I was your age. Smart, angry, trying desperately to pretend that I was something good, but somehow deep down inside, knowing you're not. I'm nothing like you. I don't kill people. No, you just dream about it. Is this how you got to Conrad and Dakota? Mess with their minds until they do what you tell them? It was a test. They failed. You passed. You stared the devil directly in the face, and you never looked away. But when you finally did, we knew that we'd found you. You used The Pathway to find me? [beeping] - Why? - Because you were stolen from us. And we needed a way to get you back. Stolen? - By who? - Those people you call your parents. They found your mother where she was hiding on the night you were born. She was too weak to fight them. - You're insane. - You were taken from your real mother - on the night you were born. - My real mother? Anne Kilton. Bullshit. Anne never had a child. You made sure of that. Every son wants to believe his father. Faking Anne's death kept Ivan from the truth. You belong to us. You always have. Anne had a plan. When Paul and Kathy interfered, you went from being a prince of darkness to just another fucked-up kid. [grunts] Look! [grunts] - Your whole life is a lie. Why are you doing this to me? Why? [grunting] [woman humming] Don't be afraid. She'll explain everything. - Where is she? - [baby crying] [roaring] [engine sputtering] [engine sputtering] [woman sobbing] [sobbing continues] [grunts] Ah! I know who you are now. [indistinct whispering] [roaring] - [screaming] - [roaring] Why? [echoing screams] No! - Oh! - [indistinct whispering] [roaring] There's a higher power looking out for you. [shuddering] I had to make sure my son still belonged to me. - Oh, God. - You had to kill before I could show myself to you. They took you from me. But I'm sorry I had to do this to you. That isn't your blood. Drink this. Accept who you were born to be, or go back to the life that you hate. Will you be with me? I'll be whatever you need me to be.
