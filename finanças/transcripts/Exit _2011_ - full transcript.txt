IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN. >> I NEED TO GET INSIDE. >> UNLESS YOU CAN SHOW ME SOMETHING THAT SAYS YOU -- >> IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN. THIS IS THE LAST PLACE I SAW HIM. I WAVED GOODBYE FROM RIGHT HERE, WHERE WE'RE STANDING. MY DAD USED TO BRING ME INTO THE CITY ON WEEKENDS. MUM THOUGHT IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS. YOU KNOW WHAT FATHERS ARE LIKE WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS. HE'D SPIN ME AROUND TILL I GOT DIZZY, AND HE'D GET ME TO POINT. "THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE GOING," HE'D SAY. I THINK HE JUST POINTED WHEREVER HE WANTED, BUT I DIDN'T WORK THAT OUT TILL LATER. JUST SEEMED LIKE MAGIC. >> YOU SEE THIS LOCK HERE? NOTHING IN MY VAN CAN OPEN THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD. I'D LIKE TO HELP. >> I UNDERSTAND. >> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. >> THANKS. [ SIGHS ] [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGING ] BEFORE I KNEW THE TRUTH, I'D SOMETIMES LIE IN BED ALL DAY. READ UNTIL IT GOT DARK. SLEEP, WAKE UP, START OVER. I'D STARE AT SHADOWS MOVING ALONG THE CEILING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEHIND IT. I KNOW IT'S NOT CLOUDS OR HARPS OR DEAD RELATIVES OR ALL THE ANSWERS. I KNOW THAT BEHIND IT IS SOMETHING ELSE. SOMETHING NEW. [ DOORS OPENING, CLOSING ] [ MARKER SQUEAKING ] >> I GOT LOST. >> RIGHT. >> YOU FOUND SOMETHING? [ MARKER SQUEAKS ] ME NEITHER. I JUST LIKE IT UP HERE. YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE CITY STOPS. THERE'S ONLY SO MANY DOORS, RIGHT? IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST MUCH LONGER. SOON THIS'LL ALL BE FILLED WITH SUITS AND DESKS AND... MAYBE WE'RE ALL WRONG. I'M NOT SURE THIS IS EVEN THE RIGHT CITY. LIKE, I MOVED HERE TO FIND A BETTER -- >> I'M SURE. I'M SO SURE I WAS BORN HERE. YOU COVER A LOT OF GROUND. >> YEAH. I'VE GOT TO STEAL SOME NEW SHOES. I JUST WISH EVERYONE WOULD STOP MOVING, STOP BUILDING, STOP FUCKING RENOVATING. JUST UNTIL I FIND IT. >> IT'S THREE BLOCKS WEST. >> OH, REALLY? YOU FOUND IT. >> SOMEONE HAS TO. IT'S LOCKED UP TIGHT. I HAVEN'T BEEN INSIDE, BUT THERE CAN'T BE MORE THAN 20 OR 30 DOORS. >> WHAT'S THIS? >> IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE DOORS. IT'S ABOUT THE WALLS THAT HOLD THEM AND THE SHADOWS BETWEEN THE WALLS AND THE SPACES BETWEEN THEM. >> I WAS NEVER ANY GOOD AT MATHS. >> IT'S NOT JUST MATHS. AH, IT DOESN'T MATTER. ARE YOU GONNA STOP OPENING DOORS BECAUSE I SAY SO? >> I GUESS NOT. >> THIS IS ME. [ SIGHS ] >> THE STREETS ALL LOOK THE SAME TO ME. I USED TO THINK FLAT, 2D. THEN I MET GRACE AND SAW HER CITY. IT WAS SMALLER BACK THEN, BUT WHEN I STEPPED INSIDE AND LOOKED DOWN, IT FELT LIKE SOMETHING...CLICKED. I'D COME OVER AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK. THEN IT WAS TWICE A WEEK. THEN EVERY SECOND DAY. AND THEN GRACE SAID... >> AND I SAID, "DON'T GO." >> SO I STAYED. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] [ RADIO SHUTS OFF ] Six blocks by six yesterday. Today, from here...to here. If Grace can cover these four, every door, we've searched half the southeast. One, two, three... Two, three... TIME TO GO. [ DOOR OPENS ] [ DOOR OPENS ] [ CLATTER ] THAT'S HOW I FOUND OUT. >> HI. >> HI. I TRIED PUSHING OPEN THIS DOOR WITH THIS SYMBOL ON IT IN RED PAINT. IT WAS STILL WET. I FOLLOWED THE SPLATTERS OF PAINT, LIKE BREADCRUMBS IN A FAIRYTALE. THEY LEAD TO THIS MAN, DRESSED IN RAGS. HE WAS FILTHY. HE HAD RED PAINT ON HIS SHOES. I THOUGHT, WHAT HAVE I GOT TO LOSE? SO I TOLD HIM I WAS LOST. >> COMING? >> YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME? "THAT'S A START." >> I WISH I COULD DRAW. >> GRACE JUST USES AN "X." AND EVEN THEN, THEY KIND OF LOOK LIKE CRUCIFIXES. >> MUST BE ALL THAT SUNDAY SCHOOL. WE HAVE THESE MEETINGS SOMETIMES. PEOPLE GET TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT DIRECTIONS, SWAP MAPS. THAT'S THE IDEA, ANYWAY. BUT EVERYONE WANTS TO BE THE ONE TO TURN THE HANDLE, YOU KNOW? REMEMBER THERE WAS THAT OLD MAN WITH ALL THOSE BOOKS? LEATHER BOOKS STUFFED WITH OLD MAPS. HE WAS DROWNING IN THEM. >> BUT HE WOULDN'T PUT THEM DOWN. >> HE WAS SCREAMING. "LISTEN TO ME! LISTEN TO ME! TOGETHER WE HAVE THE ANSWER. TOGETHER!" POOR GUY. >> THIS IS IT? >> YEAH. I JUST NEED SOMETHING BIG ENOUGH TO SMASH RIGHT THROUGH. >> IT WON'T WORK. WE SHOULD ASK JOHN. >> WHO THE FUCK IS JOHN? >> JOHN OWNS HALF THE CITY -- THE HALF NO ONE WANTS. ALL THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE EMPTY THAT ARE STILL STANDING. HE NEVER SLEEPS IN THE SAME PLACE TWICE. HE BOOKS OUT WHOLE RESTAURANTS JUST TO EAT HIS MEALS IN SILENCE. HE DIDN'T TALK FOR A WHOLE YEAR BECAUSE SPEECH IS THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT. >> AND THAT MEANS...? >> WELL, YOU SHOULD ASK HIM. HE'LL TALK TO YOU. BUT I DON'T THINK HE'LL LET YOU IN. ONCE HE LOCKS A DOOR, IT NEVER OPENS AGAIN. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ DOOR OPENS ] >> GRACE? >> YEAH. >> IT'S GETTING COLD, HUH? COLDER THIS YEAR THAN LAST YEAR. LOOK, I'M SORRY TO JUST TURN UP LIKE THIS. >> IT'S OKAY, I WAS JUST -- >> LOOK, I COULD BE ANYBODY. JOHN INSISTED. SORRY. JOHN, THIS IS GRACE. >> HELLO? >> You shouldn't be here. >> SIMON SAID YOU WERE LETTING US STAY. THANK YOU. I MEAN, EVEN WITHOUT POWER, IT'S GREAT. REALLY. SIMON WILL BE HOME REALLY SOON. ANY MINUTE NOW. >> Unless he's already found it and you don't know. Instead of being out there, counting doors, you're here, playing with your markers and your toys. David? >> IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU. [ WATER RUNNING ] >> YOU KNOW, WE NEVER WENT TO THAT MAZE. THERE'S THIS MAZE, JUST OUT OF THE CITY. WELL, WHAT EVERYONE THINKS OF AS A MAZE. YOU KNOW, HEDGES FOR FAMILIES TO GET LOST IN AT THE WEEKEND. I JUST THOUGHT... >> GRACE. >> ...WE COULD WANDER THROUGH IT, FOR RESEARCH. >> GRACE, ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES A PICNIC LUNCH ISN'T RESEARCH. [ SILVERWARE CLINKING ] A LITTLE LONGER. >> COME ON. >> HEY! [ BOTH PANTING ] >> I DIDN'T THINK THEY'D CHASE US THAT FAR. FOR COFFEE? >> YEAH. [ CHUCKLES, SIGHS ] WOULD YOU WANT TO SAY GOODBYE? >> GOODBYE? >> ONCE YOU'VE FOUND IT. DO YOU GO AND -- >> NO, I DON'T THINK IT WORKS LIKE THAT. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO AND COME BACK. SOMEONE WOULD HAVE COME BACK AND TOLD US BY NOW. I THINK ONCE YOU OPEN THE DOOR... >> YOU'RE GONE. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] >> HI. >> HI. >> YOU'RE GRACE? >> YEAH. >> I'M ALICE. >> OH. >> SOME OF SIMON'S MAPS GOT MIXED UP WITH MINE. >> HE'S TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT YOU. >> WOW. SO THIS IS US, RIGHT? >> YEAH. "YOU ARE HERE." I LET KIDS COME IN AND PLAY IN IT SOMETIMES. >> PLAY? >> Godzilla! SIMON SAID YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND IT. >> YEAH. >> I DON'T KNOW WHY SIMON'S NOT HOME YET. >> IT MUST BE HARD. >> WHAT? >> GETTING OUT OF BED, WHEN THERE'S SOMEONE WARM NEXT TO YOU. HE'LL BE BACK ANY MINUTE. >> Yeah. >> [ SIGHS ] SHE GETS SO TIRED. I'M ALWAYS, YOU KNOW, "JUST ONE MORE DOOR." IT USED TO BE FUN WHEN WE LOOKED TOGETHER. HOLDING HANDS AND TRESPASSING, TRYING TO STAY QUIET. SHE USED TO GET THESE GIGGLE FITS. Grace? Come to bed. [ SILVERWARE CLINKING ] >> TAKE YOUR LEFT HAND, PLACE IT ON THE NEAREST WALL, AND WALK. IT'S THE SIMPLEST WAY TO SOLVE MOST MAZES. OR USE THE CHAIN ALGORITHM, TREATING THE MAZE AS A SUCCESSION OF SMALLER, SIMPLER MAZES. OR TRÃ©MAUX'S ALGORITHM. ANY PREVIOUSLY VISITED JUNCTION IS TO BE TREATED AS A DEAD END. WHY DO THEY REFUSE TO DO THE SLIGHTEST RESEARCH? WHY DOES THE MAZE TURN THEM ALL INTO SCURRYING RATS? ALICE? >> SORRY. I'M NOT USED TO SITTING DOWN FOR DINNER. [ CLINKING CONTINUES ] >> I ENJOY THE ART IN HOTEL ROOMS. >> I'M SORRY? >> I'M SHARING A PERSONAL DETAIL ABOUT MY LIFE. I ENJOY THE ART IN HOTEL ROOMS. MOST ART WANTS TO DRAW THE EYE, BUT THE PAINTINGS IN HOTELS WANT TO BLEND IN, TO BE IGNORED. IT'S INTERESTING. >> DO YOU SPEND A LOT OF NIGHTS IN HOTELS? >> I NEVER STAY ANYWHERE ELSE. ARE YOU ENJOYING YOUR MEAL? >> YEAH, I AM. IT'S LOVELY. THANK YOU. I HAVEN'T TASTED WINE IN MONTHS. >> DO YOU MISS IT? >> AND HOTELS. BALCONIES, LITTLE SHAMPOOS. JOHN, CAN I -- >> I THOUGHT ABOUT GIVING IT ALL AWAY. >> ALL OF WHAT? >> ALL OF THIS. I THOUGHT THAT RARE STEAK, COTTON SHEETS... I THOUGHT THESE THINGS MEANT I WASN'T AS SERIOUS AS THE REST OF YOU. BUT THEN I REALIZED IF YOU'RE DISTRACTED BY SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A MIRROR, YOU DESERVE TO GET LOST. [ SILVERWARE CLINKS ] WOULDN'T THE SEARCH BE MORE MEANINGFUL IF YOU CRAWLED INSTEAD OF WALKED? OR BLINDFOLDED -- EVEN BETTER. WOULDN'T IT PROVE YOU WORTHY IF YOU STUMBLED, BLIND, UNTIL YOU SENSED THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU? >> NO. >> ALICE, YOU'RE NOT A RAT. YOU'VE FOUND YOUR TARGET. YOU'VE TAKEN AIM. YES? >> YOU'VE LOCKED IT UP TIGHT. IT'S JUST SITTING THERE, USELESS TO YOU. >> IT'S BEEN SEARCHED ALREADY. THAT'S WHY I KEEP THEM EMPTY -- TO AVOID REPETITION. >> I JUST NEED AN HOUR. LESS. >> I'VE OPENED ALL ITS DOORS. >> It's the one. >> DO YOU SLEEP WELL? >> I DON'T NEED MUCH SLEEP. I USED TO LOVE GOING TO THE MOVIES. I'D ALWAYS STAY UNTIL THE CREDITS WERE DONE. I LIKED THE DARK AS MUCH AS THE MOVIE. I REMEMBER, AFTER SOME TEARJERKER, SEEING THIS GIRL SITTING IN THE BACK ROW, CRYING. I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF. I WENT UP TO HER, AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT REALLY DEAD. THEY'RE JUST ACTORS. SO WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU CRYING?" NOW, SITTING IN THE DARK, ALL I SEE ARE THE EXIT SIGNS. >> I'M SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR STORY. >> WHAT WAS IT FOR YOU? >> IT WAS THE PERIODIC TABLE. >> I REMEMBER. HYDROGEN, HELIUM -- >> BRILLIANT MEN LOOKED AT THE WORLD. THEY BROKE IT DOWN INTO PARTS, AND THOSE PARTS INTO PARTS. ALL OF IT. THEY GROUND IT DOWN TO DUST. >> I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO SAY TO MY FRIENDS. >> ALICE, YOU'RE WASTING TIME. I WON'T LET YOU WASTE MINE. I COULD BE OUT THERE WITH THE REST OF YOU -- OPENING A DOZEN DOORS, LOSING MY WAY. OR I COULD BUY UP PROPERTY, SEARCH IT, THEN LOCK IT UP. REACH OUT YOUR HAND. PRETEND IT'S A DOORKNOB. TURN IT. AS YOU TURN IT, YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT TIME YOU MIGHT EAT A MEAL LIKE THIS... ABOUT THE DRINK YOUR MOTHER USED TO MAKE WHEN YOU WERE HOME SICK. >> THAT'S VERY POETIC, BUT YOU'RE WRONG. MEMORIES DON'T MATTER. GEOGRAPHY MATTERS. GRIDS AND ANGLES AND DOORWAYS MATTER. >>NEED TO OPEN THE DOOR. IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE WITHOUT ANY ATTACHMENTS TO THE WORLD. SOMEONE WHO'S FREE. OTHERWISE, YOU'LL OPEN THE DOOR, AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS TO YOU EVERY DAY. >> JOHN, IT'S JUST A DOOR. >> IF THAT WERE TRUE, SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT BY NOW. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] >> I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. >> THIS IS DAVID. HE NEEDS TO TALK TO ME. >> LISTEN, IT'S JUST -- >> I'M LISTENING. >> I NEED SOME TIME TO MYSELF. IT WON'T WAIT. IF I THINK ABOUT MY FATHER... AND I'M MARRIED. I HAVE A WIFE. >> DAVID. >> I CAN'T BE OUT THERE. >> PLEASE, SIT DOWN. >> I'M ALICE. >> I JUST NEED SOME TIME OUT OF THE CITY. >> YOU'RE NOT A SLAVE. YOU CAN STOP LOOKING ANY TIME YOU WANT. ALICE, YOU KNOW I DIDN'T INVITE YOU HERE JUST FOR CONVERSATION. >> THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. >> OF COURSE. IT'LL BE HARD FOR YOU AT FIRST. DAVID HAS A POLICE RECORD NOW, YOU SEE. I ADMIRE YOU, DAVID -- TO HAVE THIS SINGULAR PURPOSE, AND TO JUST LET IT ALL GO. >> YOU SHOULD GO. >> I'M SORRY. >> ONE HOUR. IT MEANS NOTHING TO YOU. IF I CAN'T OPEN THE EXIT, THEN WHAT'S THE HARM? >> MY WHOLE LIFE IS PERFECTLY CALIBRATED SO I CAN OPEN THAT DOOR. YOU WERE WRONG THIS TIME, BUT MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU'LL BE RIGHT. I'LL GIVE YOU THE KEY FOR $10,000. >> YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT. JOHN, PLEASE. PLEASE? $10,000. $10,000. THAT'S ALL. WE CAN ALL OPEN IT TOGETHER. WE JUST NEED TO FIND THE MONEY. TOGETHER. WE... TOGETHER. >> I THOUGHT SHE WAS HOLDING ME BACK. BUT I WAS WRONG. NOW I'M MEANT TO BE SEARCHING FOR DOORWAYS. BUT I CAN ONLY SEE FACES. LOOKING FOR HERS. DON'T WE ALL SEE BETTER WHEN WE'RE NOT HALF-ASLEEP? UH... JUST LISTEN TO ME. THIS... [ SCOFFS ] IT'S JUST SUPERSTITION. THIS IS A MAZE. BUT NO ONE SAID IT'S A FUNHOUSE. MIRRORS AREN'T THERE TO DISTRACT YOU. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. NOW, IF YOUR LEFT HAND IS DIRTY, HOLD IT UP. [ CHUCKLES ] YOU KNOW THAT HOLDING YOUR LEFT HAND ON THE WALL WON'T SOLVE THIS KIND OF A MAZE. YOU DO IT ANYWAY. YOU DO IT BECAUSE YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. WHO SAID THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK ALONE? LET'S STOP. JUST FOR A MINUTE. JUST STOP AND ADMIT THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY, DOING THEM BETTER.

YOU MUST LOVE THAT -- THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES AS THEY POUR YOUR COFFEE DOWN THEIR FUCKING THROAT. >> LEAVE HER ALONE, TOM. >> DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE? HER. BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THE TRUTH, AND SHE DOESN'T FUCKING CARE. SHE SPENT THE LAST 8 HOURS FROTHING MILK. >> STOP IT. >> YOU FUCKING STOP IT. >> HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO YOU IN AGES. >> I DON'T UNDERSTAND. >> NO, YOU DO. YOU KNOW.

I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH SHE KNEW WHEN SHE HANDED ME MY BRIEFCASE IN THE MORNINGS. WHEN I FIRST WENT TO A MEETING, I THOUGHT EVERYONE THERE WAS CRAZY. EVERYONE'S CRAZY, RIGHT? AT LEAST THEIR CRAZY MADE SENSE. I HAVE A CAR AGAIN, IF YOU CAN CALL THIS A CAR. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR MONEY. MONDAY TO FRIDAY, 9:00 TO 5:00. WEEKENDS AT HOME. JUST NOT IN THE CITY. I DON'T WANT TO RISK IT. I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING. I'VE NEVER PLANTED A FLAG. NOTHING'S NAMED AFTER ME -- NOTHING THAT'S NOT FAMILY. BUT IF I FOUND THE EXIT... IT COULD BE... IT COULD'VE BEEN ME. IT'S RIDICULOUS. DID I THINK IT WAS A SECRET TUNNEL THAT TRAVELS UNDERGROUND, OR WHAT? SOME KIND OF... [ SIGHS ] THERE'S A REASON EVERYONE FEELS LOST. SOMEONE DIES, AND WE PRETEND THEY'VE TURNED TO LIGHT, TO -- TO CLOUDS, THAT THEY'RE STILL HERE WITH US. DAD WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED THIS LIFE FOR ME. THERE'S MORE AIR OUT HERE, LESS PRESSURE. SHE LOVED LIVING HERE. SHE COULD SIT, WITHOUT MUSIC, WITHOUT TV. SILENCE ALWAYS MADE ME NERVOUS. I DON'T FEEL IT ANYMORE. I DON'T. I DON'T. THE ELECTRICITY. THE THRILL.

OKAY? >> OKAY. >> AND THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE INSIDE, TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY TO THE EXIT. THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL IF THEY'VE WALKED THIS TWIST OR THAT TURN BEFORE. AND SO MONTHS PASS, AND YEARS PASS. AND THERE ARE CHILDREN BORN INTO THE MAZE, AND IN TIME, THOSE CHILDREN HAVE CHILDREN. >> I DON'T UNDERSTAND. >> Shh. AND THEY ALL GREW WEARY, AND THEN THEY FORGOT. SOON, NO ONE WAS LOOKING FOR THE EXIT AT ALL. WELL, ALMOST NO ONE. AND NOW I'VE FOUND IT. I MADE A MISTAKE. RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING -- THE VERY FIRST STEP -- SO THAT EVERY SINGLE THING THAT CAME AFTERWARDS WAS WRONG... CORRUPT. I'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN WHAT IT USED TO LOOK LIKE. I USED TO THINK IT WAS PERFECT, AND NOW IT'S GONE, OUT OF MY HEAD. HERE IT IS. >> WE USED TO GO THERE. >> DAD. >> WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE. USED TO BE A BOOKSHOP.
