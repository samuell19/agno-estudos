To my best friend. sorry if I love you On a normal workweek Tuesday, what do you think could make a successful Creative Manager of 37, self-assured, crazy about his job, spend hours on a deserted island, and devote his time to fishing, an activity which, as you can see from the meager results, he is not skilled at? There's just one thing with the power to change a person's life: Iove! I seen love stories all the time. Sometimes they don't allow us to keep our promises... - lsn't that your husband? - Yes, but he never notices anything. They make us swear eternal love... Listen, Forever means forever. Sure, if they don't pull it off. Break with the past... I realized that I hate you! Or believe in the future... I realized that I love you. It was Thursday when it all ended. Or rather, began. I called you, but you were out. There's nothing to discover. Unfortunately. I've left and that's it. Please, don't look for me. Respect my decisions as I've always respected yours. Elena. When a story ends, the pain is proportional to the beauty of the love experienced. Then, the memories come sneaking back at you. "Love is so short, and oblivion so long" said Pablo Neruda. When you feel this way, the world seems to laugh behind your back. Everything reminds you that she's gone. Even a simple film. What girl, Adriana! I'm alone in an empty house. I'm even seeing a shrink. I feel so lonely, so much loneliness. You want me to change? If you want, I'll change. You want me more decisive, stronger, more cynical... I've missed you so much and will miss you so much more... You're forced to turn to the basest of means, and do things you'd not confess to anyone. "Tragic Love", no. "Separation, how to bounce back in 12 steps." "When she's said enough." "The first step as a neo-single, the most important, is to find an outlet." "Get up, wounded man, recover." "Yell!" You done? Are you testing the alarm? Are you being funny? I work and want to sleep at night, hear me? If you're pissed off, go take a walk! I met Alex through work and have become his confidante. He's told me a lot about these four 17-year-olds, an age in which girls are complicated, to say the least. They call themselves "The Node", from the initials of their names. Niki, Olly, Diletta and Erika. Go Naomi! You should really think about modeling. With what she drinks! Olly, real name Olimpia, extroverted, uninhibited, a goofer, doesn't believe much in love yet. Guys should be taken and dropped, sex, simple, healthy sex. Erika, more settled than Olly, already going steady. Going steady for too long, with a boy who's too precise, too methodical and especially too boring. Honey, we still have to study, and I don't want to get home late. - Gi? don't be a pain! - I'm going home. That's the price you pay for love. Diletta, healthy, wise, athletic. She's not like the others in a way they always remind her of... she's still a virgin. - When will you pay the price? - What a pain! I already told you, at the right time with the right person. But the girl who got most of my attention is her, Niki, unpredictable, sometimes childish, then suddenly a woman, generous. She believes in love and the power of dreams. You invite me to parties then you don't show up? Alessia was very disappointed. Sorry, Piero, I forgot. Good thing I remembered! Tonight I brought the party here! Girls, say hello to Alex. What are you doing? - A party, right? - At my house? Better my house with my wife? They're the Russian models from your ad campaign, recognize them? Well really, we picked them for work. Lots of people take their work home. No, offer it to the Russian girl. What's up with these sandals? You look like a monk. - They're ugly? - They suck. For the house. The man embracing this attractive blonde is Pietro, one of Alex's best friends, a lawyer, two kids, married. But this woman isn't his wife. Neither is this one. His wife's name is Susanna, and she's discovered that yoga with your kids helps family harmony. Feel the moment. You're making contact with mother earth. - Mom, I'm hungry! - Quiet, can't you feel the moment? There's Flavio and Cristina and this is their moment of deepest passion. Herb tea? A little broth. Enrico and Camilla. She's hyper and free, he's restless and paranoid, obsessed with every kind of cultural event. A poorly matched couple. Alex doesn't know this odd-ball yet, but he'll turn out to be an important person, even though their encounter didn't start out on the right foot. Hi, remember me? No, I'm sorry. I work at the agency, my desk is next to Elena's. - Andrea Soldini! - Oh, yeah! Excuse me a minute. I have to talk to you. You know who you brought to my house? Sure, three Russian models! No, a guy who talks about Elena. - How can I get away from it? - You have an obsession. You have to free yourself. We'll make Russian salad tonight. See how romantic she is, how she eats that cherry... Just think when she eats the little banana... Quit it! It's 2 a.m., I'm going to bed. "Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth". Girls! These are for you. - What are these goggles for? - We're doing Bum Bum Car. It's like bumper cars, but with real cars, glass shatters, doors fly off, these protect your eyes. - I'm not doing it. - It's so cool, you won't get hurt. - You? - Okay! - Who's that guy? - He's really hot. If he's driving, I'm in his car. Olly, cool it sometimes. There they are! They're coming! Five stolen cars from a body garage for about a thousand euro. You place a bet, the last one running wins. Rejection of the Establishment. It may be wrong, but how I'd love to be in the middle of it... Hi Niki. Coming with me? If we win, I'll take you out to dinner and we'll make up. Fabio, we're not together anymore, no dinner. Have it your way! Girls, I'm back on the market, Niki and I are through. Whoever wants to come with me... step right up. Fabio, I can't believe it, I used to think he was gorgeous. I died for him, my first time, my first love. Now I see him and don't feel a thing. Well, not exactly anything, but what an asshole. Coming! What is it? - Your friend feel bad, let's go. - What? Your friend he in the bathroom. He's here. - What's the matter? - I'm a heart patient. - I sniffed some cocaine. - What? Are you retarded? My god! Get up, breathe. Get on his other side, where's Pietro? Help, man almost dead, help me! Shut her up! What's the matter? Your friend sniffed some coke and he's a heart patient. Are you an idiot? We've called an ambulance and the police too, don't worry! Sorry, I took a little from Alessia's house. But... - I can't say who gave it to me. - Who gives a damn! You moron. - You're a moron. - Me? Him! They rang, I opened. Who doesn't feel well? Him. We'll take his blood pressure. Looks like a shady party going on here. No, we're just friends having a few drinks. - How do you feel? - Terrible. - Taking notes? - You worried? Just to know, it's my house... Are these young ladies foreigners? - Russians, with sojourn permits. - They're legal! They're models for our ad campaign, I'm a creative director. I'm a lawyer, can I offer you anything, Captain? Sergeant. It's all my fault, things were going so well with the girls... -lrina, let me introduce the Captain. -Sergeant. She speaks perfect ltalian, she's fascinated by the uniform. I called some friends, he's a heart patient, but I didn't know that. He mixed drinks, too much coffee... -Coffee - Coffee isn't good for you. Write "too much coffee". Too much coffee. - How's he feeling? - We'll take him to the hospital. Bye, Alex, thanks for everything. People, this time I'll let it slide. But watch what you do and no more night ruckus. Next time we'll come with a warrant, understood? Don't worry. Thank you, have a good evening. I got you out of a scrape, not even a hearing... - The party's over, leave. - You're sure? Yes. Girls, let's go! At least it was a lively evening, we should do it again. Next weekend? My jacket! And then, when you least expect it, when everything seems to be going irrefutably wrong, and your tidy life is a wreck, that's when it suddenly happens. Damn it! Get this little elephant tattoo. No, then maybe he'll end up getting three tattoos like you... Even numbers is bad shit. Good morning Dad. Good morning. -Good morning Dad, Mom. -Eat something. I'll have a little juice, I'm fucking late. You're always fucking late. - What's that talk? - Go slow on the scooter. You say that every morning, you wishing me bad shit? Where does she get those words? Bad shit, screw-up... From you! Where the heck were you looking? I had the right of way. What? You're a moron. You had a stop! - How are you? - My elbow really hurts. - Let me see, move it. - I can move it. You didn't even mess up your jacket. But my car door's ruined. My jeans are ripped in the back. - You all wear them like that! - These were new. - They're name brand! - Sure. I'll give you a hand. Careful! What a pain, you sound like my father. You don't respect other people's property. Now you sound like my grandfather. The front wheel's all crooked. I can't ride it. You'll have to take me to school. - I can't, I'm late. - I'll call the cops, ambulance... Then we'll see what time you get there. Get right in, no problem. Corso Trieste, hurry before they lock the doors. - Anything else? - No. Nice song. I'm Niki. Alessandro Belli. - Your feet. - What? Could you take your feet off the dashboard? Yes, Alessandro Belli. Don't you have a nickname your friends call you? Alex. - Turn here. - Stop that! - We'll short-cut, my mom does it. - It's a reserved lane. I just got a fine. - You twit! - What are you doing? I hate cops, can't help it. All we need is an arrest for insulting a public official. - You're so stiff! - Me? You crash into me, get my car filthy, we get a fine, if they arrest us we'll hit bingo! - You and I will never get along. - We don't have to. We just shouldn't have an accident. -We already have. -Right. Stop, that's my school. - Here? - Yes. Here's my business card, contact me if you need to. Creative Director. - Is it an important position? - More or less. I knew I could sue you big time. If this is fake, I'll take your license plate. And if that's false too? Boss. I expected you at my party yesterday. Sorry, Alessia, I couldn't make it, if you knew how I was feeling. -Hi Sandra. -Hi. He just got here two minutes ago. That's a relief. - Have a seat, I'll call you. - Thanks. Are you wondering if we've already met? Right. Marcello Santi, nice to meet you. I had the office over Elena's. - You too. - What? Nothing... What are you doing here? -I have an appointment with Leonardo. -Me too. I know. Leonardo said you can both go up. Ok. Please, go ahead. Here they are, come in and sit down. - Nice. De Kooning, isn't it? - Yeah. Elephants, Gi?Ponti 1930, nice. That's the way I like you, competitive. - What's in here? - Everything. Nothing. Right, everything we need. These are The Moon sweets, the future of our agency. We've been offered 14 million and a 2-year exclusive for all their products. The Japanese have set up a competition between agencies. So, what did I do? I copied them, like always. A competition between Alessandro Belli and Marcello Santi. Excuse me. - How's it going? I got B+. - You got B+? Yeah, it was forever since I did. - Who's this? - What? It's Niki! Niki? The girl you almost killed this morning. How are you? I'm in a meeting, I can't talk. And I'm in the Teachers' Room. We can't use cell phones here, what if something happens to me? We'll talk later. I already talked to the mechanic, he came to get the keys. I can't talk. Wait a sec. I have to hang up, I'll see you out front. Niki, no, Niki, wait... Cavalli, what are you doing in the Teachers' Room? - I was studying. - Turn that phone off! Don't give me second thoughts on the B+ I gave you. - Have you confirmed it? - Back to class. Presta, what is it? Professor, you weren't fair, I'd like to negotiate my grade. You want to negotiate. So, you're like Cicero. Aliquem liberaliter tractare. Meaning? "A person should be able to negotiate." It's not your case. Fuck off. - Send them in. - Right away. Here are your personal assistants, people who won't disappoint you. People of fullest confidence. Alessia is perfect for this job. She'll be Marcello's assistant. You've worked together too long, I want to create new synergies. I'm sure we'll do a great job together. For you, your perfect shadow, the genius of graphics. Here he is, Andrea Soldini. Hi. Now go and dig in. The role of Creative Manager for foreign markets is up for grabs, plus a considerable pay rise. The loser will be transferred to our agency in Lugano. - We'll make a great team. - Like last night. Who's that guy? The brother of the guy she dumped after Christmas. He doesn't know what he's in for. Did you see your Bum Bum Car friends? - Big deal. - I don't want you going anymore. You're such a pain! So cool. Excuse me. How was work? Fine, as always. Would you kindly take your feet off the dashboard? You're too old school, you pretend you're young by wearing sneakers with a dark suit, but then you're a ball buster. This is my work outfit, I'm much more casual in the evenings. You mean more fake-young? Forget it, where's the mechanic? He said he couldn't do it today. He can't do it? Meaning? First you wreck scooters, then you're surprised? What did I pick you up for then? You ran me down this morning and don't offer me anything? Let's take a walk and make up. Okay, let's "make up". Are you sure? There's no parking downtown. Cops go on lunch breaks too, let's get a smoothie. Last one there pays. Last one there pays... "Whoever has loved bears a scar". De Musset. But sometimes he forgets about it. Two smoothies. Can I have a straw? - Mom? - Where are you? -Around with Olly. -That's odd, she just called for you. I mean, I was with Olly a while ago. - Who are you with now? - I met a friend. - Who? - You don't know him. Come home, you have to study. I'll leave you something in the fridge, cut the lies. Mom? Yeah. Your daughter gets worse everyday, with all her lies. Fertile imagination, like her mother. Meaning? Don't you remember the lies you made up for your folks? No, like? Like you were a virgin bride. Well I don't think that's Niki's case. - It got towed. - Maybe you left it further down. It was here, under the arch, now what do we do? We'll think of something. Good thing the cops were at lunch. Ticket conductors never get on, don't worry. Tickets, please. Tickets, please. - 86 euro and 15 cents? - Plus the fine. That too? - Understand? - What is it? I'd have saved money by buying you a new scooter. Nothing worse than a cheapskate. - Hi, this is Andrea Soldini. - How are you? We're all here in the office, will you drop by later? - Let me drive! - No! I have my license! Sorry Andrea, I'm running late, let's do it this way, free inspiration, we each follow our own method. Let's go! Okay, so we'll stay on it. Free inspiration today. I'm getting my license soon. But I have my learner's permit. - He's really down? - Totally broken up. Physically too, he's lost weight, skin's a greenish color. Poor thing, he took a real blow. He and Elena were about to get married. He never answers his phone, I think he can't talk about it. - Only Pietro managed. - I had to go to his house. He was in bad shape, crying, a tragedy. He didn't want me to leave, but it was 2 a.m., he asked me to stay the night. What could I say? - The other evening, right? - Yeah. You're so sweet. He's here, avoid remarks about Elena, it's not very nice. -Hi everyone. -Hi. Hi everyone. Are we ready to order? Where did you leave the wife? Could we have a little water please? - What'll we have? - The pasta's really good. A nice bass cures all ills. Bass all around? It took my money! - Want a hand? - Thank you. I'm an expert, I've been ripped off lots of times too. - What do you want? - A24, plum cake. - Thanks! - Don't mention it. "Love is like lightning, who knows where it'll strike until it does." Henri Lacordaire. - Who are you writing? - No one. That's bull, let me see. Let me see! Read it, we'll hold her. Read it to me too, I'm curious. It wasn't for you. You tell me things to my face, right, my love? Don't call me your love. - I don't care who you were writing. - Good. I just wanted to say I found a new aka, Fabio Fobia. - Like it? - Yeah. It's original, especially for a guy who does hip hop. - Fabio Fobia... - What a name! Know why it didn't work out for us? Because you're sour grapes. This lettering's archaic, it's no good. Let's think of the moon, in a metaphoric sense... The moon is a great white melon. Maybe the historical sense is best. When Armstrong set foot on the moon, he found this candy. I wouldn't like to spend the rest of my life in Lugano. Is it that bad? Nor would I like to regret saving your life. Excuse me a minute. Keep working, new ideas, come on! - Enrico. - Forgive me if I didn't call first. No need, what's the matter? I have a problem, can I talk? Let's go in there, it's empty. Have a seat. So? You look so... what is it? Camilla's cheating on me. - No way! - I'm sure. Yesterday she left two pairs of shoes under the chair. So? Diane Lane, Richard Gere, "Unfaithful", she can't decide between shoes, because she has another man. If a woman's undecided, doesn't mean she's a whore. I mean, it's not alarming. But it is, Camilla has changed so much lately. Changed, how? When we make love she's more... More? -More... -More? - More desiring. - I wish I had these problems! I'm not joking. You have to do me a favor. You have to see a private detective for me, Toni Costa. Not a detective, please. You're the only one I can ask, do it for friendship. - Okay. - Thank you, you're a pal. Relax, I have to get back to work. - It's wasted money. - Let's hope so. Promise me you'll stop with the Richard Gere films. - Who's this? - You didn't register my number? I'll be waiting out front. - I can't. - I'll wait for you just the same. Okay, I'll see you at the school. I didn't know you had a little girl. Neither did l. fine rullo 2AB Here, I don't like having debts. I was glad to offer it to you. - I'm Diletta. - Filippo. I said no, get off the subject! They're always fighting. There's Fabio, I'm leaving. - Where? - I'll tell you later. - Go, my ex is right there. - And so? - He wouldn't understand. - What? - And he likes to use his fists. - Get up, he's gone. You're the worst, arriving so late. Sorry if I had an important meeting. Your feet... Please, no feet on the dashboard. Go that way. -This way? -yes. No, it's closed! closed? You show up at 2, of course it's closed. Right... How can I get to Fregene? I have a really important contest, it means heaps to me. - You'll take me, right? - Not on your life. Come on... Don't look at me like that, I won't be swayed. Let's go! - Slow down! - Can't keep up? "We were together, I forgot the rest of the world." Walt Whitman. -I'll be right back. -Ok. -Can you hold this for me? -Ok. Thanks for the lift. You're welcome. She kissed me on the lips. Settle down... She did it to thank you, that's normal. She's so beautiful! Nice here, isn't it? This is my second home. School is like a second home too. I like going to school. I like how she wipes her mouth. Alex, you're totally out of it. Why's he looking at my mouth? I bet I have something in my teeth. Thank you. I need a better ice-breaker. Tell me about the competition. - I'll solve it for you. - You will? Okay. A Japanese company wants to launch a new candy on the market. My group and I have to find the best way to do it. - What's the candy like? - It's moon-shaped. I'll take care of it, I'm very creative. My mother. Mom. Your phone's been off for two hours. I'm at Erika's, reception is weak here. How long has it been since you heard calls like this? It must be ages since he's heard calls like this. - I think I hear the sea. - No, we're studying. - I'm staying for dinner. - Come home soon. OK. I have a cool idea for your ad. Shoot. Oh no, not shoot! I mean, tell me. There's a city where everything suddenly turns into boxes of candy. "Finally, The Moon candy, The Moon, a city of sweetness." Cute, but it's already been done. Brooklyn Bridge Gum, 1988. I wasn't even born in 1988. Why did we stop? Wait here, don't leave the car, this is a bad neighborhood. Yes, Dad. I'm Alessandro Belli, I'm looking for Tony Costa. I'm Adele, Tony's assistant. Hi. It's for you! And I'm Tony Costa. Profession: private detective. Breaking and saving relationships is my specialty. I know what you're thinking, that l should be a cynic, ruthless man, someone who crushes others' emotions. But it's not true, I take each case to heart. At night I dream about couples in crisis, and when I discover a betrayal I get stomach cramps. But I've learned to put on a professional front. It's part of the job. Jealousy is an irrational, paralyzing disease. All it takes is a hair style, a message at the wrong moment and we'd do anything to know the truth. That's why people like Alex sit in front of me wigwagging their arms and, with pleading eyes, say... It's really for a friend of mine. And I almost always decide to believe them. - Will you leave a down payment? - An advance. Is 1,500, okay? That's fine. I'll give you an update in a few weeks. - I'll call you. - Thank you. Goodbye. So? Who's cheating on who? What? Don't play dumb, you rang at the detective's. I told you to stay in the car. - That's true, you did. - Well? Well, I do what I want. - I don't want to talk about it. - Then I will. - You broke up with your girl. - What do you know? I can tell, you're in that phase, it's classic. As soon as you break up, other women disappear. You haven't even looked at me. I've looked at you and seen a little girl. And you'd be the adult. A guy who wants to find out if she cheated on him? It might have been a great love story, but why hurt yourself? - It's not for me, it's my friend. - They all say that. My boss. We have lots of proposals. Tomorrow at four? Sure. Great, on the dot. - Shit, I knew it. - What's the matter? I just have to find a brilliant idea by tomorrow at four. Why don't we go to your house and find some inspiration? - This house is really cool. - Thank you. - Did you do this ad? - Yes, like it? I adore your nylons, even if I always get runs in them, but I don't wear them everyday. Sure. Is there a terrace upstairs? Yes. - Can l? - Sure, go ahead. Want something to drink, vodka, gin and tonic? Coca Cola. - Here. - Thank you. - Coke and jasmine. - Good? We could invent the Jasmine Cola. Want to steal my job? It wouldn't work, the name's too complicated. People like simple things. Taste how good it is. - Good. - And me? Do I have a good taste? Sorry, but it's too complicated. It's a simple thing. I can't. You can, you can. - You have a sweet scent. - Jasmine. - Don't think about anything. - Only with you. - You're trembling. - Hold me. I want you. You're so beautiful... - Only with you. - I want you. Only with you, Niki. A kiss. Here. Again. The jasmine girl. You smoke? I can't at home, my folks don't know. - As if they knew the rest... - That I'm not a virgin? Among other things... Are you crazy? They've never had the nerve to even talk about it. When I was with Fabio it was obvious, we were always locked up in my room. - Are you jealous? - No, why? A little. No... A little. That's awesome! I can't stand jealousy, but the thought of you being jealous of me... I could go crazy. It's late! My parents will kill me! I have to go home. Palmiri, F, the usual disaster. Do me a favor, draw a couple of things for me? No way. Where were you last night and especially, what did you do? If you do the drawings, I'll tell you all about it. - In full detail? - Yes. Deal. Tell me about the interesting parallelism you drew between the cruel nature in Leopardi and the melancholic suffering of Totti, the soccer player. Well, I think... It's normal that Leopardi wrote agonizing love poems, when you have a physical defect like him, who was a hunchback, it's normal to be gloomy, isn't it? Think so? Remember Totti before the World Cup, after his accident? How could we forget? He seemed sad. Professor, maybe he didn't write "To Silvia", but Totti's broken ankle makes me think of Leopardi's hunchback. Either way, they're both poets. Tell me something, the two of you. Do you want to graduate this year or not? If possible... - I'm in love. - Really? - What's he like? - Gorgeous. - But there's a problem. - Meaning? - He's with two women? - No, he's 20 years older than me! Awesome! And I still waste time on you... What's going on? Niki's with a guy who's 20 years older! - Wow! - I want to hear the whole thing. - 20 years, I've said it all. - Are you all nuts? No good, this is old too. We need something new, more original, surprising. Guys, I've seen Marcello's work, we really need a stroke of genius. How sweet of you to tell us these things. Sorry. - Alex, there's... - I'm not available. Okay, sorry. "I'll give you the perfect idea..." I'm crazy. Spending my days screwing around with a 17-year-old instead of working. What do you want? She can't remember her own things, let alone mine. She doesn't even call! I'll call. I'll call her. -How are you? -Hi. What are you doing here? I had an idea for your candy. Tell me. I have a drawing. Why don't you bring it? Your secretary won't let me in. Where are you? Right outside. - How are you? - Fine. Are these the ones? Come in. - Are you sure? - I'll introduce you to the team. This is Niki. Hi. She brought us an idea. I thought about what Alex told me about the candy and thought up some things, my friend did the drawings. It's beautiful. They're beautiful! Run! Wait here for me. I have a surprise for you. Talk to you later. Great! Come with me. - Thank you. - Where are you taking me? You won a free driving lesson, you can crash my car. You're crazy! Tell the Japanese agency we're sending the proposal. No problem. "We are such stuff as dreams are made of." William Shakespeare. - You're strange tonight. - Why? - The club for my birthday? - I thought it was nice. - Your friends are playing. - No, to be alone with you. Happy birthday! Carmila! Carmila! Carmila! - What is it? - Come here. So, Tony? - Who? - Tony Costa. - He took the job. - Good. Maybe someone's already spying on us. Maybe... That's what you wanted. That's what you paid for. Did you notice Camilla? - What? - She cut her hair. "A Woman, A Scoundrel", Lino Ventura. When a woman changes hair style, she's about to change her man. New rule, no Richard Gere, no love films, of any kind, actually, try a week of cartoons. -Cartoons? -Yes. - Thanks. - For what? Tony Costa, the whole deal. Nothing. If you don't let go of my arm... Keep an eye out... Are you done being a hermit? Have a little Japanese food. I guarantee the world's full of women just waiting for you. I have my small satisfactions. And you don't say a word? - How old? - What's that got to do with it? It's important, how old? Seventeen. Seventeen, if you say anything, I'll break your neck. Seventeen years old, how sly! You're awesome, I want to go out with her friends. - You're sick. - Can we go out with her friends? No. You're a real jerk. - What time did you tell them? - Alex talked to her. - What time? - I don't know. - They're coming from school. - That in itself is a total turn on. - I'm hungry. - How can you think of food? There they are! - Nice place. - Who knows how much it'll cost! They're paying, I don't have a cent. - I'm leaving. - Where are you going? They're too young. I'd do 30 years in jail for the redhead. Watch yourself. - Which one's Alex? - The end of the table. He's hot! The others are ugly. - The one with the tie isn't bad. - He's married. You never change! Nice to meet you. Why don't we all sit down? Sit down, a man, a woman. This is Niki. This is Niki. I got it. I'll sit here. This a memorable day, we should all thank Alex. For what? - You're buying, right? - Sure. Champagne for everyone. -Champagne -You'd rather have mineral water? I knew you'd get to the subject of clubbing. It must be twenty years since you went dancing, it shows. You're way off the mark. - We've been... - To Goa. - The birthday was... - Giorgio's 40th. 40th birthday at Goa? Not even my grandmother would do that! Shut your mouths, or it's group suicide. I dig your purple nails... Like them? The medallion too, it reminds me of my military service. People have sex at 40 like at 16, maybe at 40 it's better, there's more experience, is not as rushed as at 18. - If you know what I mean... - Who's thinking about their 40s? - Life is now. - Is that the line for an ad? - That hair clip is pretty... - Thank you. It's your obsession, I'm not jealous. - Guys, am I jealous? - You bet! - Aren't you jealous of your guy? - What guy? - Do you think I could get jealous? - See, she's open. - I'm going out for a smoke. - Me too. Where are you going? He's never smoked! Instead of smoking, why don't you take me back to my 20s. We can take a ride on the scooter, holding each other real tight. - Not too tight. - Pretty much. Okay, let's take a ride. - Kids, it's Daddy! - What a surprise! A kiss! Mom brought me to play soccer finally. - What are you doing here? - Having lunch with Alex. Straight down Via Veneto then turn right. Yeah right... Kids today... They don't even thank you. I'll go say hi to Alex. He's in tears, it's best you don't. Poor guy, he can't get over the break from Elena. - I'll say hello anyway. - Are you kidding? Imagine how devastating if he saw us, the kids, the happy family. - You're right. - See you tonight. - Bye, love. - Give a kiss. Bye. You're still burning over Pietro? Just think if his wife had caught you a minute later! At least she'd know who she married. He's like that because they've been in a crisis a long time. Sure, Olly, always full of excuses. Why am I the talk of the town? There's someone else here who's not owning up, right? Let's see the marks Alex left on you. You're a dimwit! So what if there are marks? You walked right into this one. No way, she's just falling in love. What do you mean, just! This arrangement's unbearable. - No good? - Let's change it? No, please, the marks will stay! Cavalli, dream on! We could be lighthouse guardians for a while, wouldn't it be nice? - What? - To live in a lighthouse. Nice, but highly impossible. You're a real slave to the Establishment. Work, produce, earn... You miss the best things in life. - Like? - Me. Right, I forgot. - But I'll save you. - Thanks. You are wellcome. Hello. You again? Is she another Russian girl? - No, ltalian and I have a permit. - It's true. Let's let them go, goodbye. - What's this about Russian girls? - It's about work. Work? Release the clutch... I'm back! You'll make me lose! - Did you cut your sideburns? - A little. Nice, you look younger. I'm off to study. She's too happy... - Is there anything I need to know? - Meaning? - Is she sleeping with someone? - You still don't get it? Why am I the last to know? - What are you doing? - I have to go home. Stay in bed, I'll take a taxi, my love. What did you say? That's it's 2 a.m. and I'll take a taxi. No, what did you call me? Yeah, I've decided. Sorry if I love you. - Sorry... - If I love you. Think that's romantic, right? Italians are romantic, more than 50% of their text messages contain the word "love". I want a divorce. It's absurd, there are no reasons. That doesn't mean relationships are always smooth. - lsn't that your husband? - Yes, but he never notices anything. If you say so. Or that there's no backtracking. Forgive me, I realized I can't live without you. Or drastic decisions. What a bitch, "forever" my ass! Fuck off! - Please, do it for me. - You're crazy! - I think it's too much. - At least I'd feel better. I don't know how to tell them, what do I say? You'll get along, you're almost the same age. Sweet. Won't you make me happy? Come on, make me happy. - Excuse me? - There's a doorman. Thank you. I'm Alessandro Belli. - I've come... - Yes, I was waiting for you. - Waiting for me? - They contacted me. Please. - lsn't it lovely outside? - Lovely. Please have a seat. Thank you. Let's get right to the point. I'm 39 and my husband is 45. We had our daughter when we were very young. - I love Niki very much. - Of course. - Do you have children? - No. Too bad. You never know what can happen and we really want security for her. Of course. - May I offer you something? - A glass of water. As far as I'm concerned, there are no doubts. I'm pleased you're responsible for this situation. You give me a feeling of trust. My husband and l have discussed it at length. - And we're both convinced. - Your husband too... For Niki we'd like... to invest 15,000 euro in a retirement fund. - Do you think it's too little? - No, exactly right. Then I'll have my office call you. - Yes... - So they can open your file. I think that's best. We'll wait for your call, then we'll sign. -Ok. -Bye. Goodbye. The retirement fund rep called me. - Now? - He can't make it today. - Are you there? - I'm here. Bye. My mother mistook Alex for a retirement fund rep. You sent him to meet your mother? - Sure. - Good god! - Just imagine... - What do you mean by that? Just imagine. You're just a kid to him, soon he'll need adult women, he works, goes abroad. Are you jinxing me? I can't go abroad? Maybe Olly's right this once. How do you know you can trust him? I want to trust him and I want to believe in love. Alessandro, the idea didn't sell. They need realistic dreams, not a girl hanging on clouds and surfing among the stars. You have a month or we're completely out. - How are you? - Fine. I've met a very peaceful girl, she causes me no trouble. A person who gives me happiness, joy. - Stop! - Let go of me! Give me back my ideas, you bastard! - What's wrong? - Nothing. I want to introduce you to Niki. This is Claudia, my sister. Did he make you mad? - That's him. - Oh, yeah? I'm going home, my parents are waiting for me. Bye. I hope I'm there when you introduce her to Mom and Dad. How do you think they'll take it? Just fine, right? She's really only 17? You let my Elena get away? 17, meaning 17? You should be having kids, not sleeping with them. Just one word, trouble, tons of trouble. So your girlfriend has a collection ofWinx dolls too? Maybe I should wait until she's 18. She's not even 18? Are we sure he's not risking jail? With girls under 16, you go to jail. Anyway, he could be her father. So, what's the problem? What? Don't be a moralist. Which ones do you like? Going out again tonight? - Don't have anything to tell me? - No. - Something about retirement funds. - You've opened one? Don't crack jokes, he's twenty years older than you, he's a man. Think about it. I swear there's nothing to be worried about. Sure, if you swear it, I won't worry. At least I had you meet him, will you trust me? No. My mother's lost faith in me thanks to you. So has my sister, thanks to you. To make up for it, I brought you to the Club. -Thanks. -You are wellcome. These are all potential Moon Candy consumers. I think they buy everything here except candy. Every evening she's with a different guy. - What will you have? - A Coke. A Coke and a grappa. What are you doing here? - You're hurting me! - Who the fuck's that? - None of your business. - How long have you known him? That's why you disappeared. Who's the guy? Mind you own fucking business. If you want, I'll handle this. I told you to mind your own fucking business. Too much alcohol? Pills? He took a blow from an asshole. - It stings. - Sorry. What's this? You used this? It's for fungus. But it still works, right? I'm sorry about what happened. Me too. - Is it over? - No. - Are you afraid? - That's not it! One of us will get hurt. There are too many years between us. I knew this would come up and I'm prepared for it. Tom Cruise and Kathy Holmes, Montezemolo and Andreoli, Woody Allen and Soon Yi, Pierce Brosnan and Kelly Shaye-Smith. Perfectly happy couples with at least twenty years difference. We'll make it too, my love. Sorry! "A night of love is one book less read." Honor De Balzac. But sometimes that night can change your life. I love my work when love is no longer a tragedy but something magic that turns life into the most wonderful thing ever. Everything fits together perfectly and your reality is the way you wish it to be. The ideas you lacked, come to you. Vending machine boy! Girl who doesn't like debts. - How are you? - Fine, you? - What are you doing here? - What do you think? - Right, stupid question... - A little. Walk me to the car? I'm late. It's down there. It's coming in. Want to go for a run one of these days? That would be great. Say when. How about next Sunday? Congratulations to Alex and his team! - Congratulations. - Thank you. - So, see you Sunday. - I'll look forward to it. - A hug. - Bye. - These are for you. - What did you do? Nothing. You're about to become the star of the new The Moon campaign. Oh, when did you take them? Last night while you were sleeping. DREAM AWAY WlTH THE MOON. I don't believe it... - Do you like them? - Fantastic. It's Olly. Olly, are you ready to see me posted all over Rome? Diletta had an accident, we're all at the hospital. - What the fuck happened? - She hit her head! I wana see her. We can't go in. - Where is she? - There she is. You can't come in here! Wait outside. She's our friend. - The doctor's coming in a moment. - What moment? Out! You can't stay here. Doctor! Your friend has had a serious cranial trauma, brain functions are active, but for now we have to wait and hope. How can you say something like that? How can you! Diletta has to get better, she can't die! Let's wait outside. Who did this to her? A car crashed into her at the park, we'd just said goodbye. I'm sorry. - I brought you something to eat. - Thank you. Go home, you won't solve anything by staying here. - The Russian Revolution? - I know that, 1918. - Don't you wish... 1917. - Damn. Remember when we took our own pictures? Spanish Civil War? 1922-1929? You're off by at least ten years. 1936-1939. I'll never make it. You're not trying, are you studying? I can't. Sapere aude: have the courage to use your intelligence. You hear? There's no getting out of it. You have to graduate too. Now something a little harder. Kant's "gnosology". Gnoseology. With an "e", you always say it wrong. Gnoseology is a beautiful word! - I'm really happy. - I'm dying to see you, my love. I have to run and check the prints for the posters. - lt'll be a horrible day. - I'll always be there with you. - Can I see you tomorrow? - Yes, if I can work it out. - Okay? - Bye. - What are you doing here? - I realize I made a mistake. Elena. - Why did you disappear? - I wrote you. Right. Your note, I forgot, thanks. In that moment I thought it was the best way. When you proposed, I got scared. - It's normal to be scared, right? - Sure it's normal! So I disappeared, forgive me. It's easy to disappear, go, come... Think you'll find things the way they were? Things change. What's changed? Nothing's changed. Nothing. Trust me. Hi love! Where were you yesterday? I was working a lot. What's the matter? - Nothing, why? - You're acting strange. I've thought over our relationship. The situation's not good. Still on the age difference? Even your favorite song says: "Life will tell." Only when you're 18 can life be better than a song. Why? We had fun, we dreamed. - Is it wrong to live a dream? - It's not realistic. You're a coward. I put myself into this, I love you. Things end if there's a valid reason. Do you have one? Maybe I don't. But I don't have a valid reason to stay with you either. You changed everything! What's all this absurdity? It looks like a madman's home. I guess it's my fault. Look how she's bounced back after just a month. She's too much, but now she's got graduation exams! You don't know the risk you ran, you could have left without having done it! As of tomorrow we're having fun. If I have too much fun I'll end up like her. - I warned her. - I'm just fine. On that subject, I brought you a wonderful surprise. Look who I brought. - May l? - Sure. - How are you? - Fine. If she gets laid in the hospital he's a legend. Come on, Olly. What? Dinner is ready. I have to study, I'm not hungry. - Sooner or later you'll have to eat. - I have to study. Stop this, it's been over a month! There are so many who are intelligent handsome, fun, and your own age! "It's better to have loved and lost, than never loved at all." Tennyson. But love is a little like a game of poker, it might be good to see the hand, you might have a chance to win. Who's she, another sister? If you'd told me she'd come back, I'd have accepted it more easily. I'm sorry. There wasn't a valid reason to stay with me. You made me think it was my fault. Nothing to say? Sometimes it's easier to keep quiet. I want to say something, I have to take my final exams, I'm suffering, I can't study. But I have to do it because it means growing up, which is exactly what you should do. She wanted to know where we're going, but I didn't say. - Let's hope she doesn't jump off. - What? She's really low. Alex was such a creep! You're all crazy! How cool! I have four passes for the aftershow of the Zero Assoluto band. - Stop thinking about Alex. - I'll try. My love, I'm exhausted. - Wait while I get my Ayurveda? - Who? - The Ayurveda massage, wait for me? - Sure. - Everything looks fine. - Let's say so. I'm pleased. I'm a serious worker, I didn't steal the money you gave me. But there's this too. There are other days here, other paths. Different photos from the ones you've just seen. Perhaps. Or maybe not. Please, take it, so that you, I mean your friend, can decide what he wants to know. Alex gave me a fabulous gift to celebrate his promotion. Maybe a little expensive, but you should see it. - What is it? - A summer duster to die for. Don't talk about dusters, please. You're not even married yet and you've already sunk so low? Next we'll make a dishwasher chart. Where have Alex and Enrico gone? My whole life I'm waiting for a man to come home for dinner? What metamorphosis did Alex have while I was gone? The house looked like the loft of a crazy 20-year-old. Can we start eating? - I think they're here. - Let's have some pasta. It's about time, the pasta's in intensive care. Sorry I'm late, my love. - I'll wash my hands and come. - Hurry. There was traffic. personally I think truth is rarely better than fiction. Not that I like lies, but is it useful to call them "lies"? Isn't "temporary suspensions of reality" better? If this red file had made it to Enrico, this civil chatting with Pietro wouldn't be possible. It's not easy to share your wife with someone else. Especially a friend. A straight 80/100! You're such a ball-breaker! I've got a great gift for our graduation: Greece! If you can't forget him on los, I'll give up. Let's hope. Please, the marks will stay. Niki. That's what I want. If we break up, some day you'll see it, you'll remember, and you'll feel terrible. Sometimes a memory is enough to see everything clearly. Something simple can show you where you went wrong. Only you can decide what to do with your life. Your life. I just bought one bottle, Iast time the Alessis came empty-handed. - I can't do it. - What? I'm sorry. I'll stop taking you to the Alessis if they have this effect on you. The problem isn't the Alessis, it's much simpler than that. I don't love you anymore. What? What's that got to do with it? Do you realize what you're saying? Unfortunately I do. Again with this story that I left... I can't stand you when you're like this. We'll talk later. You're awake, good. "My love, this morning I woke up and thought of you. I was still aroused thinking of what we'd done. And it excites me to death thinking you'll be in a meeting with him. Can you come by at noon? I really want to..." I'll skip the list of your filth. I'll pick up from here. "l hope you win, so you'll stay in Rome and we can continue being together. The way I am with you, Marcello..." But Marcello, who should have taken my place, Iost and was transferred to Lugano. Odd coincidence, you reappear. Suddenly. Know what I've done? I've packed these nice suitcases and put all your things in them. Please. I even packed your soap bars, don't worry. I'd like you to do a very nice thing, like the fairies do in movies. Actually, even better. I'd like you to disappear, forever. Here, this is yours. Alex, you shouldn't have! I wanted to thank you, you helped me so much. I just did my job, why are you giving me a new computer? Because you're a true friend. You knew Marcello, you worked with Elena, it wasn't so hard to discover it was you. That e-mail was sent at 9:45 p.m. from a company computer. Only you and Leonardo were in the office at that hour. And I'm quite sure it wasn't him. Forgive me, maybe I was wrong. Not at all. Actually, thank you. This is the trip's log book, I've already written something. Yesterday I broke up with Gi? -No kidding? -I want to go wild. Every page will have a different name. Go Erika! That's my girl! Try and convince these two, they have good reasons for living it up. I have Filippo waiting for me. When I get back, I'll go on a rampage. Hope so. A high school graduate, I'm here with my friends and with all that will happen. Fun, fun, fun and never any pain. This is love, I'm a little scared. But if you don't jump in... Filippo could be... How I'd love to be happy. I want to be happy. I'm sure I was right to leave him. I was just scared to admit it. It was over, now I just want to fall in love again. We should be happy for what we had, but it's hard when you're hurting. I miss something terribly. I miss you, Alex, I can't help thinking about you: when you lose your smile and want to seem happy, when you pretend you're not thinking about it. Maybe one trip isn't enough. september DO YOU WANT TO DREAM? - Cool! - When did she have them taken? She told me something... They were great. It looks like she's really sleeping. Look who's here. Proposing a new investment? - Who is he? - The fake financial rep. I just wanted to give her this. Niki isn't here, she'll be back in two weeks. I know. Is he Niki's dude, the old guy? What do you know? Hush up and go home. - Excuse me a minute. - What do you want to do? Can't read a thing, let's boil some water? - You're already hungry? - He wants to steam it open. - Where do you learn these things? - In Diabolik comics. We open it, read it and close it up, Niki will never know. Niki's eighteen and does what she wants. I know, we'll just peek. I want to know if Alex and Niki are getting back together. Matteo, it's your sister's life. Please! Niki was very hurt. I don't want her to feel like that again. Let's do this. We'll put it here and I swear I won't touch it. We'll take some time to ponder. If anyone opens this letter, I'll raise hell. - You mustn't open it, clear? - Clear. That goes for you too. Hear that? - What are you doing? - Taking the things I'll need. The campaign's a success, the Japanese have asked us to work on other projects. Call your friend back from Lugano. - Meaning? - I'm leaving. You've had another job offer, if it's a question of money, let's talk. No, I'm going on vacation. While you're away, I'll get Alessia to set it up. I don't even know when I'll be back. Like the ad with the guy who wakes up naked on a deserted island? Why do you think everything's an ad? There are other things in life. I'm back. - Hi Dad! - Here she is! Welcome home. Hi! - Did you eat enough? - Starting again? - She's so thin. - See how pretty she is. Of course. I brought gifts for you. This is for you. - These are for you. - Santa's sack! - A pareo! - An Olympiakos T-shirt! You found my size! What's wrong? Don't you like them? See? We did the right thing not opening it. Yeah... Let's go. What is it? I can't believe it. What? You're even more beautiful now. - Are you joking with me? - It's true! Olly was right. What did she say? That I've wasted lots of time. We can make it up. Do you see now what led Alex to bait and Korean worms? But it's not over. Remember Niki's lighthouse and her dream of living there? Alex went. Hello, Mrs. Winspeare. There's turbot fish today. Not thanks to me. To have a dream come true, you must know how to wait, reflect, be patient, it's like learning to fish or win a woman back. Since living at the lighthouse, Alex always looks at his watch, as if it were an unspoken lure for Niki. But the beauty of love is that it is exempt from any calculation. It's now 21 days, 8 hours, 16 minutes and 24 seconds I've waited for you. I've waited for over 18 years and I've never complained. Let's start over from here. Promise me one thing. - What? - What I'm thinking. I promise you, my love. "True love is like ghosts. Everyone talks about them, but few have ever really seen one." La Rouchefoucauld. a year later... Pietro was caught and kicked out. He and Enrico are still friends and he's never said a word to him. Camilla is seeing another guy. Flavio and Cristina continue having fun, sometimes they go all out and rent a horror movie. Elena has moved to Lugano hoping to get Marcello back. She hasn't so far. Andrea is engaged to a Russian model. He never used drugs again. Diletta and Filippo are catching up. Erica looked up Gi? she phoned him and they argued. She didn't say a thing to the Node. Simona and Roberto have invested in a retirement fund, but for themselves. No news from Niki and Alex. Maybe they haven't left the lighthouse yet. Something strange happened to me... Two weeks ago, a friend of mine met a boy in a disco, but she's afraid of emotions. Don't look at me like that, it's not for me. Okay, it's for me. I'm not a girl who falls in love, I've always been too scared. Now that it's happened, it's wonderful!
