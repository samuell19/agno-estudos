- What are you doing? Leaving? - No, we're not. - No. - No. Thank you. Be seated. Ready? - What an exhibitionist clown! - You're right. Go sell lasagna! - Stop it, clown! - Be quiet! - You be quiet! - Stop it! - Go back to Torre Annunziata. - You don't know a thing! Where are you going? It's not over yet! - It's disgraceful! - Just a moment. - Not one minute more! - I'll pay. Where are you going? I love music too much to stay and listen to this maniac! I'll pay you! I'll pay you 10,000 liras. - 10,000 is a lot of money. - It's actually 5,000. There's my share, plus taxes. You understand that. Well? Listen, girls. What do we care about Beethoven? - In fact! Well? - Well, let's go. Payment after the concert. Remember to cheer, and do it loudly. - Spaghetti maker! - Blasphemous! It's indecent! That damn scoundrel! He called me "spaghetti maker"! He called me "spaghetti maker"! Son of a dog! I could bet anything on it. He was nothing but a saboteur paid by my competitors! Are you running the marathon? - I'm following you! - Listen! Did you… Did you… find the man who called me spaghetti maker? No. Not that one, but I spotted the one who called you "lasagna" with disdain. Only "lasagna". Not small "cannolicchi"? - No. Only that kind. - Only that kind of pasta? I don't even like lasagna! Enough! Enough! It's time to stop it! I can't be mixed up with a vile pasta factory! Tomorrow, I'm selling everything. The factory and the tagliatelle inside! Maestro, allow me to disagree. The pasta factory you inherited from your uncle allowed you to cultivate your passion for music. Without Pasta Benvenuti you wouldn't have money for your concerts. - Let's change the pasta name! - Allow me to disagree again. Stop with this "dysentery"! I humbly want you to note that dysentery is an ailment and I said "disagree". In fact! In the food sector, Benvenuti is a name, a brand, a guarantee. It's time to stop! I can't be confused! I can't get my name mixed up with rigatoni and agnolotti! As of tomorrow, either the pasta goes or I do! We are one too many! Who is it? Oh, God. So scary! So scary! Sabotage. Sabotage… Maestro, it's nothing. Don't get so upset. - No? Why shouldn't I be upset? - Don't take it so seriously. - Anyway, there is a solution. - Which is? You could change your name. - Damn it, the hell… - You hoodlum. What do you mean? After I spent millions to make my name popular, you propose I change it? Are you my friend or a friend of my German colleague? - Do you mean Von Karajan? - Von Kalicard, yes. Only one man is worthy of being called "maestro". - Who is it? - Serafino Benvenuti. The one who has the moral inheritance of the great Toscanini. You can say it loud! "The moral inheritance of Toscanini". I just didn't want to inherit the pasta factory. I'd like you to consider that without that money you would've remained a humble conductor of the Torre Annunziata City Band. Well, you're right. The scoundrel, the scoundrel… Stop! I caught you! I caught you! - You were hinting at… - Maestro… You were hinting! - No, I swear! - I'll kill you! - Why? - I will slit your throat! Listen! Listen to those delinquents! Listen to those scoundrels! Bandits! They're driving me crazy! They're driving me crazy! I am going out of my mind! I told you to go to the police station! I went there. They have permission to play until 2:00. It's legal. Maybe it's legal in hell! I can't stand it anymore. - I'm fainting. My earplugs. - Here they are. - My earplugs, my earplugs. - Here they go. We must wipe out these bastards. These savages! Throw a bomb at them! That's better. Why are you standing? Sit down, you are too tall! Come on… What are you saying? I don't understand. Speak louder! Oh, God, I've become deaf! Maybe it's the shock. One, two, three, four. Hello? Can you hear me? I've become deaf! I have an ear trauma. Oh, my God! The earplugs! You must remove the earplugs. - What earplugs? - The ones in your ears! - Me? Have I got earplugs? - Yes, in your ears! It's true. Why didn't you tell me? Why are you sitting? Get up! - You told me to. - I told you because I was deaf. Why are you standing around there? Go throw a bomb at those gangsters! Excuse me. Hey, old man! Move your roots! Do you want to dance? No, thanks. Where can I find the boss? He wants the boss. There are none. See you, white slave! - Who is the boss? - I don't understand! - Who can I talk to? - To him. He's deaf. Thank you very much. - Do you work for the company? - I am the company. Finally I found you. What a nice place! - You like it? - Nice people. I'm here on behalf of the landlord. Can offer you a drink? Maybe a whisky? Thank you, but I'd like to talk about business first. - All right. Come with me. - Thank you. Excuse me. No worries. Beat it, guys. - Please, sit down. - Congratulations. - I'd like to get right to the point. - You want a cigarette? - I don't smoke at work. - I know what you want to say. First, we haven't paid the rent in three months. Second, we broke at least five contract clauses, and third, the neighbors are complaining. I'll get to the point. Your management issues interest me under another profile. I'm here on behalf of the owner of the building facing you, Maestro Serafino Benvenuti. - Who? - Benvenuti. I've never heard of him. Excuse me, but that is a serious drawback. I'm not surprised, though. As I'm not surprised you're in trouble with your landlord. Maybe I am exactly what you are looking for right now. Please, take a cigarette. Thanks. I'll take two. One for the cook. - You have a light? - Of course. - As I was saying… - Yes? Maestro Benvenuti, patron of classical music, is willing to pay to have the club closed. What? Close it? Yes. If you accept… I'll make him pay two million and we'll split. - Sorry, I don't understand. - I'll have him give me two million. - I understood that. - And we take one each. We can reach an agreement without anyone knowing. You can count on me. What do you say? I have another idea. Let's go tell everyone. - Come. - It's fine with me. Guys, a moment of silence! This gentleman has come to propose something. If we leave this place, he'll pay us in cash. We have to dismantle everything, stop singing, playing, dancing and everything else we like doing. All that to avoid irritating the sensitive ears of the owner of the building in front. What do you say? Out! Go away! - Can you show me the exit? - Sure. End of the aisle, and then right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Careful with my door. Guys, let's have fun now! Good morning, maestro. Today is Thursday 3rd September. The weather is humid, but it's sunny. I don't care if it's humid or sunny. Orazio, tell me something. How'd it end up last night with the "Yé-yé monsters"? They're in serious financial trouble, but refused the offer. Besides being crazy, they are idiots! - Yes, sir. - Did you say "financial trouble"? Yes, sir. They haven't paid the rent in five months. - No problem, then! - Why? We'll have them evicted. - The building isn't ours, sir. - What does that mean? In 24 hours we'll buy the building. - Orazio, it's an order. - Yes, sir. AN ORPHAN OF THE CHILE EARTHQUAKE ADOPTED BY BENVENUTI - Oh, God! - Is there an animal? - Did you read the paper? - I'm reading it. It says that we adopted an orphan girl from Chile. Why use the plural? "We adopted?" I adopted! Many illustrious people supported this need. For example, Josephine Baker adopted ten. Taylor, Boskovsky, Picasso. Many people were adopted. Altafini, Sivori, Cané. - Adopted? - By the Napoli team. Do you mind? Here. This is the group of orphan girls. I hope they send this one. - I prefer this one. - This one? Why? - She looks more like you. - You think so? - Yes. - You say so? - Sure. - Does she? - She's very similar. - I agree with you. - She is… - Identical. - Even her profile? - Even more so! - Her hair… - Everything! What a lovely little girl! Excuse me, maestro. Have you ever been to Chile? Have you? No, but during the war, I met a Chilean woman passing by. - I don't think it's her. Too little. - Maybe her mother. Oh, God. Oh, God, I feel dizzy. - What is it? - I feel nauseous. - Nauseous? - Nauseous. Orazio, I am craving strawberries. Strawberries? Where will I find them in this season? Orazio, try to be understanding. I am expecting a little girl. - Let's ask over there. - Yes, the information office. Excuse me. On what platform does the plane from Chile arrive? - You mean gate. - Did you change? - Third gate. - Thank you. Excuse me. - Let's go. - Alright. There she is. She's surely my daughter. Yes. She's so cute. And she looks like me. - You're identical. - Identical… - Dad! - Rita, my lovely daughter! This is my daughter. No. She's the little girl I adopted, coming from Chile. This plane comes from Paris. - Does it? I'm so sorry. - No problem. - Where is the plane from Chile? - There, gate number three. They're calling you. Go! Hurry, let's go! Where are you going? You're not allowed to go there. Come back! - Stop! It's forbidden to go there. - Stop! You don't know who I am! - Here we are. - We made it. Good morning. - She must be at the end. - Yes, maestro. - There she is! Rita! - Granpa! - Rosetta! Rosetta! - Rita! Rita! Granpa's love! - Which one is Rita, then? - Me! - Are you Rita D'Angelo? - Yes. - Is she the orphan? - I don't know. I'm a 1949 earthquake orphan. I was last on the list and kept waiting. Got that? I brought you a doll. - It's beautiful. I've never had one. - You want it? I guess one earthquake is the same as any other. - What are we doing with the buggy? - Easy, turn it into a Fiat 500! Rita, my daughter! Good morning. "An orphan girl adopted by the Benvenuti pasta factory owner." The pasta factory daughter. My Orazio! This pasta industry hinders my career. It's time to close the factory. What time is it? Not now. You have a daughter to educate and to raise. You're right. I've a daughter to raise, to educate. I want to make a great woman out of Rita. I have an idea. What would you say if she became a famous pianist? - Excellent idea! - Excellent idea? I can already see the posters. "Debut of pianist Rita Benvenuti, daughter of the famous maestro, Benvenuti Serafino!" My name will definitely help her in her career. Sure. Imagine her concerts. She'd enter the philharmonic or other music concert halls dressed elegantly, tall, serious looking. Well, not tall! Serious looking, with a lovely grand piano. "Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. I'll play now. You will lick your fingers." This girl was born under a lucky star, as the saying goes. Being my daughter is a big advantage for her. - Why are you doing this? - No! Of course. I was following… - You're doing this! - I'm sorry. Shaking your head means a negative reply. What is it? What happened? Who is it? You hear those cursed scoundrels? Now even during the day! No, maestro. The music is not from the Tomato Club. It's coming from the garden. From… the garden? Who let them in? We broke up You want to know why? He took me to the zoo And he said this to me, smiling: "That funny goose looks a bit like you." You look like a goose, a goose That is what he said He made me so angry I can't tell you how much So I said to him: "You look like a monkey. You can win over a monkey's heart, certainly not mine." "You look like a goose, a goose." That is what he said He made me so angry I can't tell you how much So I said to him: "You look just like a monkey! You can win over a monkey's heart, certainly not mine." - Goose! - So I am a goose? Ugly chimpanzee! Go back to the jungle, you gorilla banana eater! So I said to him: "You look just like a monkey. You can win over a monkey's heart, certainly not mine." - Rita! - Dad! - Rita! - I'm coming! Enough! - What did I do wrong in singing? - You call this singing? When I was in Chile and was left alone, this is how I made ends meet. Poor little one. She hit rock bottom because she was in need. We must have a conversation… about music. Why? You don't like it? I like real music, with a capital "M", not this garbage. - I don't understand. - You will. You will, while hearing a record of an orchestra with 250 musicians directed by me without a baton. Only with my hands. Fantastic! I want to hear it right away. Of course. Go to my studio, turn on the record player. I'll follow you. What did you want? Maestro, I'd like you to notice that we've never recorded anything. - How is it possible? We were distracted. - Evidently. We can make amends. Do we have a label with my name? - We have three million of those. - Well, then. Get any record and put a label on it. - What record? - That Von… - Von Karajan? - Von Caligaro. That's it.. Among colleagues… We don't bother with details. Let's go. Hey, guys! Can you hear the music! Let's hang up a poster in that old goat's home. He'll get a stroke and we'll get rid of him. Let's go! Take off your shoes. - Shoes off. - One, two. Pull me up. Here. Thake this. Come on. The bucket. - Here it is. - The bucket. Come on, Fabrizio. Good morning. - Buenos dias! - Where are you from? From Chile, but I've become Italian. What is your name? - Fabrizio. And yours? - I'm Rita. - Don't act like Juliet-o. - I've never seen you before. - I've only been here a few days. - I thought so! - We know all the girls from here. - Do you live in this area? - Yes. - Have you finished? No, he hasn't. - Why don't you come down? - I'm sorry, I can't. I have to work now. Why don't you come out? I can't. I have to listen to this stuff. - What is it? - A real bore! Hello, girls! You have the wrong speed. Try moving it to 78. It's more fun. Nice chicks! Try! What is going on? Orazio! Orazio! - Where are you? - What is it, maestro? Listen to her! She is ruining Bach. She's reducing him to garbage! The child is still too immature to comprehend great musicians. I can't stand this massacre. Rituccia, my Rituccia! Why don't you like real music? - Why didn't you take after me? - Because you're not her father. - Right, that's true. - She must be supported and educated. You're right. Someone should be responsible for her education. She needs… She needs a trainer. Excuse me. Maybe you meant a governess. Yes, an uprighteous person with healthy, moral principles. And remember, above all, musical principles! - First and last name. - Greta Bergeiden Wagner. Wagner? Are you a relative of the "anonymous" great man? - Homonymous. - What did I say? - Anonymous. - They're related. They're Germans. Maybe on the aunt's side. I did some research and I am missing a link. - What? - A link, a hook. - Go get that hook. - Maestro… - Alright, later. Age? - You don't ask that to a lady. You are right. I could slap you. Are these questions to ask a lady, a Fräulein? You're tall. I'd get on a chair and slap you just the same. He's ignorant. His intelligence developed sideways, as you can see here. Education? Degree in Philology, Specialisation in Semantics. Simultaneous Interpreter diploma. German, English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Russian… Upper Chinese, lower Tibetan, Yemeni… Hey, Fräulein! My daughter is a little girl. Not the president of the UN. - Alles gut. - What? Alles gut. That too, but English and French are more necessary. - Are you engaged? - Never. - Do you smoke? - How vulgar! - Are you a card player? - I only played with my doll. Wow! What a memory! Do you drink? Wine, liqueurs, aperitifs and such, between meals? Neither during meals nor between them. But you love music. Yes, good music. Modern music? Cha-cha-cha, twist, jazz! How horrible! All those dances disgust me. Get her out of my sight, otherwise I'll marry her instead of hiring her! - When should I begin? - Today. Ja! You'll be responsible for the moral and cultural education of Miss Rita. My daughter must learn about classic art. - Architecture, monuments? - Sure, and above all, music!! For those who don't know, we eat bread and music in my home! - Jawohl! - Jawohl! Heil, Hitler! To be successful today, you must have an idea. We should write a piece like that too. Yes, he beat me to it. A mint slush and a beer for that table there, please. Sure. - Hi there! - Look who's here, the wall boy! - You always disappear in a hurry? - No, not always. Sometimes, with my friends. They are unpredictable. - And extravagant. - It depends on the situation. Why did your dad let you come all this way? Isn't he afraid you'll be contaminated by the jukebox music? That music is a breath of fresh air. I'm 18 and it's not easy… - To be 18? - No. To put up with Bach! - Rita, kommen! - I have to go. - Wait. Who is she? - My governess. Go or she will put us in a concentration camp. We have a meeting place near your home. Come see us. The air will be as fresh as in the mountains for you. - Really? Who knows! - Sure. You knew a man without a heart He is in front of you A man without a heart is very sad But that is no longer so As of today, I will laugh too I will suffer, I will dream Because I want to live as others do As people in love There is a new world inside of me Thanks to you Thanks to you, thanks to you I never wanted anyone close to me My sky had always been dark Until I saw you As of today, I will laugh too I will suffer, I will dream Because I have someone to live for And someone to believe in There is a new world inside of me Thanks to you Thanks to you, thanks to you As of today, I will laugh too I will suffer, I will dream Because I want to live as others do As people in love There is a new world inside of me Thanks to you Thanks to you, thanks to you Thanks to you Thanks to you Come in. A beer for me, please. Come on! Hurry up! You can't stay too long tonight. Tomorrow morning wake up at 7:00. Don't worry. I'll set the clocks back one hour. You owe me 300,000 liras for last night. Double or even? Ja. Love I wonder if at this moment You feel badly too There are moments, who knows why When words are against us I'm sorry, I'm sorry I apologize I said words to you That I didn't mean I said them to hurt you Instead, I only hurt myself And all I can do now is cry All alone You, only you, only you There is no other in the world Like you, because you Are my love, yeah! My heart knows that for you That for me There is no other in the world Like you, because you Are my love… - Who is she? - Let's say I discovered her. But I only hurt myself And all I can do now is cry You, only you, only you There is no other in the world Like you, because you Are my love My heart knows that for me That for me There is no other in the world Like you, because you Are my love Your heart knows it… Bravo! Bravo! Yeah! - Wow! - Surprised? - Yes. I thought you were different. - Different in what way? I didn't think you liked pop music. - Why? - Daughters take after their dads. My father played the drums in a jazz orchestra. What? Maestro Benvenuti? A drummer in a jazz orchestra? No, Louis D'Angelo. - Who's that? - My biological father. I lost him in the 1949 earthquake. - I'm sorry. I didn't know. - It's ok. Maestro Benvenuti adopted me. He's a good man, but unfortunately he is rigid when it comes to music. He only believes in his music. - Then I think… - What? - He won't let me hang out with you. - We can see each other if you like. - Mr. Fabrizio Carli? - Yes. I am the bailiff. This is for you. There's been a misunderstanding. They can't say we don't pay. - What does it mean? - We haven't paid rent in 3 months. We'd agreed with the landlord that we wouldn't pay until we were even with the expenses to fix the place up. The old landlord has nothing to do with it. The building was sold. The new landlord sticks to the contract for accounting purposes. You've got seven days. You can pay up to the last minute. - Good evening. - No. Excuse me a minute. - Who is the new landlord? - It's written there. Serafino Benvenuti. - Good evening. - I… I swear… - I didn't know anything! I… - No! No, Rita! Rita. I know it's not your fault. Don't be upset. - I'll stop him from doing it. - You can't stop him. You couldn't change his mind even if you cried forever. He can't do it. He has no right. There is always a moment when young and old are at war. Now it's my turn. I must fight it by myself, and rightly so. - Victory would be less sweet. - You won't win. You've been evicted. I know. We've just opened, and our guests are not very rich. But one day we will be famous… It's late. You must go home. Yes. Wake up call at 7:00, the German, a tour of monuments. What a bore! - I want to see you tomorrow. - And how? Speaking of monuments… Come tomorrow morning at 10 at the Gianicolo fountain. Alright? - Alright. - Bye. Bye. Haven't you had enough? We've been here half an hour. - Please, another minute. - Don't look there. The view is this way. I know. What time is it? It's 10:35. Let's go. - How are you driving? - Watch your feet! - You watch your wheels! - Don't make me laugh. - My friend is funny. - Do you have a permit? Don't you know you need a permit for going on foot as well? A permit? - She's asking which permit… - She hasn't got any… - Did you pay the pedestrian tax? - It's a serious offense! - There is only one way to be saved. - A friend at the ministry. I can't go too far away. Don't worry about the Fräulein. My friends will keep her busy. They're specialized in these jokes. They could go on for hours. How do you smile with your eyes? I don't know. Maybe it's because I am happy for the first time. Me too. But let's go now. I'll show you my favourite places in Rome. Today is an ordinary day Yet it feels like a celebration morning There, in your eyes If you smile at me Even the road I take every day Changed its color today There, in your eyes Here, in my eyes Everything is more beautiful Or maybe it's just that today I was reborn with you There, in your eyes Here, in my eyes He is different from anyone He was reborn with you Now you can say you really visited Rome. It's not just an old stone museum, but a city that's alive and modern. Nobody wants to kill Grandma, but you can't stay on her lap forever. Her stories are such a bore… By the way, we need to go back. Right. We have to go now. Come on, Fabrizio. It's late. There are so many things I'd like to tell you. - Will you come see me tonight? - Impossible. It's Dad's concert. - I'm sorry I won't see you. - Why? - Because I like you. - Me too. - I liked you before. - I've liked you forever. If you keep looking at me with those smiling eyes, I won't let you go. - We must go back to Fräulein. - Right. Let's go back to Fräulein. - Speak Italian! - The law doesn't admit ignorance. I am German! - Nein! - Jawohl. You need your trittico. - It's like an insurance. - Have you got your trittico. Your yearly inspection? I don't know. If I made a mistake, I'll pay. Guys, we made a mistake. The lady was crossing on the cross-walk. We apologize. If someone breaks a law, I would tear my hair out! GREAT RETURN OF "THE 4 FROM FORMIA" WITH MAESTRO SERAFINO BENVENUTI - You're a bit nervous. - I'm following the concert as well. - We can play another game. - Yes, forty minutes left. - I'll be right back. - Miss Rita! Not one word to Dad or I'll tell everything. But miss… - May we continue? - You should go with her. Miss Rita can take care of herself. So! Let's see. After last game - you owe me 714,900 liras. - It was 600,000! You must add a daily 12% interest rate. - These are promissory notes. - A game debt must be honored. - You're a real shark. - What is that? - I'll explain later. - You're a sucker. - What happened? - The concert is over! If maestro can't find Miss Rita, I am ruined. Bye, sucker. - Are you not coming with us? - No. I'm staying. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Are you not coming? No, I can't. I have to work on the press release. I can take care of it. The director of "Big" is courting me. Thank you, Adriana. I'll take care of it. I understand. Well, is she the one? I really think so. Does it bother you? It's better to be clear, right? Does it bother me? No. It hurts a bit. But there was nothing between us. I wouldn't want our friendship to end. No, never. It's lasted since kindergarten. Bye, Fabrizio. Be happy. Thank you for not hurting me. Thank you for staying close to me. I'll walk you to the car. My heart, you are suffering What can I do for you? I've fallen in love There is no more peace for you If I laugh or cry at the world Only you share it with me With every tear Every heartbeat Every moment of love With you, I am living My first torments My first happiness Ever since I met him There is no more peace for me I love him, I love him so much And you beat inside of me At every small At every tender Emotion of love I know this More and more each day And more and more You will suffer Oh, my poor heart! Oh, my poor heart! You will suffer more and more More and more each day What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be at your dad's concert? What's wrong? - Where are you? - I'm here. - It's me. - Excuse me. - Is everything alright? - Yes, maestro. - Have they all left? - Sure. - Is the hall empty? - Yes, sir. - Listen. - Yes? I heard someone in the audience shouting "I'll wait for you outside!" I heard that, too. He also added: "I want to give you two black eyes like this!" - Whose eyes? - Yours, sir. - I missed that. - I see. Why didn't you react? No, I let it go and thought, "I want to see that!" "I wish this man would give him two black eyes!" - What would you have done? - I would have backed away. And then slowly, I'd have rolled my sleeves up and looked at this gentleman in the eyes, I would have taken tiny little steps towards him and said: - "Sir, you are very rude!" - Is that it? - Sure. - I'll blind you! You have my word. - Where is my daughter? - She ran away, sir. - Did they threaten her too? - She went home with the Fräulein. The poor girl couldn't cope with the disaster. Did you realise those idiots fell asleep during the "Allegretto andante"? Oh, no! Oh, yes! I did all I could to keep them awake, banging this. Nothing. I even set the alarm! An alarm! They were sound asleep. - What if they were dead? - Dead? Yes, it's an idea. No. I would have smelled it. There's four of them. I'd have smelled it four times. I think that some enemy is involved. - Maybe someone from the Tomato Club? - Drugged? - What? - They were drugged. - You know something! Speak up! - May I, sir? Of course you can. Just whisper. The enemy is listening. Yes, sir. When the four professors arrived from Formia, they were very emotional and nervous. - The musicians? - They were excited to play with you. Modestly speaking. - You are a maestro who… - Makes people uneasy. - Yes, makes people uneasy. - Let's admit it. Do you admit it? - We are alone, you can admit it too. - Yes, I admit. I can admit it anywhere and everywhere. Well? They were nervous. I tried to calm them down with a tranquilizer. Murderer! You ruined me. You're a scoundrel. I will… - Excuse me! Did I hurt you? - No… I didn't? Take this! Don't be so upset. I understand. You had a big disappointment. Child, you must know that in every artist's career there's always a failure. Maybe a small one, but it's there. I'll give you an example. Let's look at Peppino. - Peppino who? - What? Verdi. Verdi's name was Giuseppe. We musicians call him Peppino. - Mascagni, Rossini and Giacomino! - Rondinella? Rondinella. No… What are you making me say? I mean Giacomo Puccini. They were booed as I was, and maybe even more. We must be strong and brave. A we must insist. That is my motto. Insist! It's for posthumous… Well, posterity to judge. - Hello? - Who am I talking to? - Maestro Benvenuti's home. - Good morning. I'm Fabrizio Carli. - I'd like to talk to Rita. - Oh! Wait. Thank you. I won't be precise because the lady spoke quickly. I repeat. "That snake must not call again nor come around. He should put his face in mud. He can call his shallow girls." Yes, sir. She said "shallow". - Who is it on the phone? - The copyist. What are you saying? What copyist? - It's Mr. Shallow. - What's his name again? - Shallow. - What a name… Excuse me, Mr. Shallow. I was telling the maestro… - Yes, the maestro. - Tell him to come today. - Come as soon as possible. - What? I said "today". Give it to me! - Hello, Mr… - Shallow. You have the pleasure of talking to maestro Benvenuti. Today at 3:00, come to my home because I must have you copy some changes in my concert. I order you to be precise. Understand? - Yes. - And on time! Certainly, on time. Goodbye. Mr. Shallow… - Good morning. - What are you doing here? I am the copyist. You want me to talk about your 50% proposal? - How dare you? - Orazio! Yes, maestro! The copyist is here. - Maestro, I am honored. - My pleasure, Mr Honored. Follow me. - Watch the steps. - I can see them, thank you. - Did you see them? - Yes. Imagine if you didn't! Please. This is what it's all about. Remember to be exact, clear and to keep distances. You see these signs? They must be widened. - Perfect, maestro. - Let's hear it. Mi, sol, fa, mi, fa, mi, fa, mi, re, sol. Well, well. You're the first one who can read my handwriting. - It's very clear. It looks like mine. - You enjoy writing music? - I've got a diploma in composition. - Wow! Apologies, then. - Then why are you working as a copyist? - I need the money. - I understand, dear Mr. Shell… - Shallow. Right. Dear Shallow, me too, as a young man… My life was like the novel of a poor young man. At your age I was an usher at Torre Annunziata Town Hall. Perseverance and audacity helped me! A maestro like you didn't attend the Conservatory? - No. - It's incredible! I learned music with distance learning. The first orchestra I had the honor to conduct was the city band of Torre Annunziata. Here I am. I would accompany funerals and processions. But the much awaited moment finally arrived! - A concert? - My uncle's funeral. - I inherited a pasta factory, and glory. - I don't have rich uncles. - Dear Shillow! - Shallow. Dear Shallow, don't despair. A rich uncle may pop up! Meanwhile, you met me and you can make good money.. I'm an active composer. I write music all the time, everywhere. So I urgently need a full time copyist. - Thank you. With you I will reach… - You want to reach the top? You can bet on that! Here is all you need. I'll leave you now because I must go to the radio. - To conduct a concert? - No, to renew my subscription. "The sonority of his music is proportioned to the grandeur of the concept. A concept that, beginning with a romantic base, evolves and is transfigured, both structurally and from a content point of view…" Oh, God! Dad has gone crazy! Fabrizio. - Why are you here? How'd you get in? - Through the door. You can't stay. If Dad finds you, he'll slaughter you. And you know what? I am ready to… Olé! Matar el toro! Fabrizio, please, go away. If someone comes… - You want me to leave? - It's better. I am afraid. Alright. You know what? I won't leave until I've explained how things stand. Ok? If what I saw isn't true, I just need an eye doctor. Is this the tone you're using? Alright. Then I'll stay here. Fabrizio, someone is coming. Please, go away. I'll only leave if you give me a kiss. Why do you want a kiss? You don't love me. You think I'd have risked so much if I didn't love you? - Any news? - Dad? No, maestro. Young student, how's the work? You're here too. - Have you met already? - I came down to get a book. - I didn't know someone was here. - Good girl. You'll have to get used to seeing Mr. Shoe. Shallow. - Excuse me. He's at home here. - Thank you. It doesn't seem like it, but he is a promising musician. Bravo! Let's see the work. Semiquaver, quaver, demisemiquaver… - Brilliant. I'm happy with that. - Thank you. I did what I could. You did a good job. - I'd like to ask you… - Don't start asking. - Tomorrow is Thursday. - Are we having gnocchi? No. We young people meet for private concerts. Look at that! Excuse the question. - Is this all real? - Yes, we are… - No, I meant your hair. - Yes. - Disgusting! - About the concert… I could join as well and bring some prestige to the event. It would be an honor, but you would make us feel uncomfortable. Good boy, very humble and modest. My daughter Rita can go. - Maestro, I didn't dare ask you. - Dare! Dare! Dare! - Scoundrel. - I'll come by tomorrow at 5 pm. Remember: Precision. I expect people to be on time. - Count on me. I was a boy scout. - Good! What did he do? - Dunno. - No idea. You're letting me go out with a guy I just met? This girl is amazingly naive. You think Dad would have let you go out alone? Do I look like a legionnaire? You'll go with Fräulein Greta. She is so dear! Naive, reserved, shy. She's a little girl. - A little girl! - No! Not with that hairdo! - You'll see, it's going to be amazing. - Absolutely. Will you write about us? - I accepted to help you, but… - Piero is a friend. Don't exaggerate. I value our friendship, but I don't own the newspaper. I'm happy to publish a picture, but we need something newsworthy. We need ideas. You want some musical ideas? We have as many as you want! - Listen. - Yes, I'm listening. Let's go. She belongs in a cuckoo's nest. She's crazy, but she's also very nice. Shall we sit down? - I brought this loser too. - I pay for your cigarettes! - Why aren't they here? - I don't know. - Bye. - Bye. - Let's go down and wait there. - They'll go if they don't see us. Let's go downstairs and call. Let's find out when they'll get here. I'm thirsty. Let's go down, drink, and… Das Teufel! Rita! I'll take care of it. - Looking for someone? - It's my business! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Guys, look. It's not difficult. - What? The "plip"! It's not difficult The plip, the plip It's not difficult Come on, try with me Touch your thumb with the pinkie Of your other hand And then the pinkie of the other thumb And repeat With the heel, touch the other tip The other tip touches the other heel Do it ten times, from left to right Who arrives first wins C'm on, it's not difficult The plip, the plip It's not difficult Come on, try with me! Touch your thumb with your pinkie Of your other hand Then the pinkie touches The other thumb, and repeat With your heel touch the other tip The other tip touches the other heel Do it ten times, from left to right Who arrives first, wins -It's not difficult -The plip, the plip It's not difficult Come on, try with me Touch your thumb with your pinkie Of your other hand Then with your pinkie Touch the other thumb and repeat… - Who is she? - Maestro Benvenuti's daughter. That crazy megalomaniac? What news! Do it ten times, from left to right Who arrives first wins -It's not difficult -The plip, the plip It's not difficult Come on, try with me It's not difficult the plip, the plip It's not difficult Come on, try with me - Two sugars? - Yes, two. Traitors! Saboteurs! You want to ruin me! They want to ruin me, but I'll kill them all. It'll be a massacre! They want to ruin me. What are you making me do? Turn the sleeve like this. Are we Siamese twins? Orazio, I will fire you! I will fire you! You delinquent copyist, street parrot! Betraying daughter, where are you? Come out. I know everything! - She's not here. - Come out! - She's not here. - She's not. -Calm down, maestro -Damn! Calm down, please. Serpent, viper! - I'll kill the copyist! - Maestro! Maestro, bitte! Don't bitte me! I'm going to poison you, you were an accomplice! I give you eight days notice. No, eight hours, or eight minutes… Eight seconds! Go away! Disintegrate yourself! Copyist! I will kill you! Let me go! Let me go! - Dad! - Mom… Dad… - Dad! Oh, God, Dad! - Daddy… - Help! - Maestro, I'll help you. The sword! My knees, my femur… - Are you hurt? - Who let him in? - Scoundrel, go away! - My intentions were serious. I'll show you what seriousness is! I'll bust your head! Let me go! I will go crazy! - Go away! Go away! - Dad… Don't call me "Dad". Lock yourself up in your room and bring me the key. I'll show you. Scoundrel! How dare you come to my home! - The usual two, maestro? - Yes. - Did the child eat anything? - No, maestro. It's all his fault! - They have to move out in two days. - You think they'll pay? Highly unlikely, according to my informers. Only two days to go. Two days to go, and that betrayer is fasting. What is she doing? Crying? - I'm afraid so. - Are you? I am. She'll get weak if she cries. She is so little! She'll disappear. Darn it! This damn music! Come, my child. Don't do that. Come on. Don't do that. Come downstairs and eat something. Starving won't sort the situation. I am not a tyrant, nor am I an idiot. Do you think what you did under my roof is nice? Like Ulysses in the horse of Troy. I was becoming fond of him. You think I hadn't noticed that you liked him? I was once a young man too. So many loves at first sight, so many first looks. Modestly speaking, I was very popular! People in Torre Annunziata know that very well. But I never snuck into a place in disguise. Come downstairs. Rita! Rita. Oh, God. She's cold! Orazio! Orazio! - What is going on? - A tragedy! The child… is cold! She is dead! I don't want to see. - No, maestro. It's a doll. - A simulation? - Yes. And there's a letter. - Who for? - You, sir. - Who wrote it? - The doll. - When did she write it? Before bedtime… Of course it's your daughter's! Dear Dad, I know I am causing you sorrow, but I can't help it. I want to help Fabrizio and his friends with my singing. They need my help now. Thank you for all you did, and please love me as much as I love you. Unfortunately I love him too, very much. Him, too! You realize that? I'll kill them all! Don't hold me back! You can't disgrace your name with a scandal. Think about the child. - She's not a child. - We must protect her. Protect her? It's right. She's under my custody. - Custody? - Yes, I have custody. - You ate custard? - Is this the time to eat? We must act shrewdly and get into the enemy's hideout. We need to be very careful, we need maximum caution. - With light feet. - What shoes should I wear? - You didn't understand. - You know what the objective is? Him. Only him! I… Will never forget him I… Need him - He… - He… Is still in my heart He… Is still in my eyes He is still here in front of me The evening he said goodbye -I will never forget him -You will never forget him I will never forget him You… Help me You… Tell him a bit about me So he remembers That in a corner of the world I exist -I need him -You need him Help me But maybe it's better That he understands That if he comes back to me It will mean that He is a bit in love with me too He… Is still in my heart He… Is still in my eyes He is still here in front of me The evening he said goodbye -I will never forget him -You will never forget him I will never forget him But maybe it is better If he realizes himself That if he comes back to me It will mean that He is a bit in love with me too He is still in my heart! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Excuse me, guys. - Sure. How did you get here tonight? I ran away. I'm never going back to that house. - You will. - Fabrizio, I… Believe me. It's better like this. - Maestro Benvenuti is a crazy maniac. - Hold still. - But he loves you. - And I love him too. He did a lot for me. I didn't give him even one satisfaction. If I have to choose between you and him, I choose to stay with you. I would want that too. But what can I offer you? All of my hopes were in this club and in my music. But unfortunately tomorrow, it will close. Your father will create an auditorium or a pasta storage room. Darn! It was wonderful to meet you but go back to the person who loves you and can give you a future as well. Maestro, it's time. Shall we intervene? We'll intervene, but in a different way. I drank at the fountain of love. Your lies, you deceiving kisses, a subtle poison in my heart… What an article! …made me like you. Evil! Cruel! I have become cruel! You wanted me to be cruel I hate your love, I hate you I just want to keep away from you You look for my love, but in vain I hate your love, I hate you You want to play with fire You are to blame If I don't love you anymore You forgot to play this game And you ruined our love Poison - Who brought him? - Maybe Fabrizio. A sun without poison Without your love is shining for me What a great success! And how many people! Too many people for you! Don't you feel the need to be alone? - I must think of my club. - As of today, I'll worry about it. Finally I found the right kind of music for me. - Go on, kids. - Thank you, maestro. Call me Dad. Go on! Come here, girl! - Want to play a game? - I won three million. I've a dowry. - I'll marry you and we'll be set. - Yes, but have your hair grow. - The maestro will think about you… - What are you insinuating? Nothing! I'm running to the paper. I want to be the first to give the news that the "Yé-yé" have a new idol! Take pictures! There is a new world inside me Thanks to you Thanks to you, thanks to you I never wanted anyone close to me My sky had always been dark Until I saw you Tonight Will be my first night with you You know it's important for me because I've never lived a love story All of my own I've never found a moment all of my own But tonight it will come, I know Tonight Tonight is my evening with you Finally you are here for me I waited, and nothing else really matters - Only us! Us! - Only us tonight! - Us! Us! - Only us tonight! Us! Us! Tonight Will be my first evening with you You know it's important for me because I've never lived a love story All of my own I've never lived a moment All of my own But tonight it will come Yes, I know Tonight Tonight is my evening with you Finally you are here for me I waited and nothing else really matters - Only us! Us! - Only us tonight! - Us! Us! - Only us tonight! THE END
