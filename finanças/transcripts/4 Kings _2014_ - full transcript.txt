You're here again. -Hi. Hey. Is this a human or a shrine, huh? Where have you been for several days? I've been worried. I'm sorry. I know you're upset about your Somdej amulet. But drinking won't help. Hmm. Go ahead. What did you do that for? I'm sorry. Where have you been? I've been right here. I've been planning a way to get my Somdej amulet back from Boss Pu. How will you get it back, huh? I'm thinking about challenging him to a card match. Boss Pu is a great card player. How can you beat him? If you can't beat him, cheat him. You idiot. What's so damn hard about it? You moron. I don't mean that you or I will play him ourselves. I already have someone in mind. Who is it? Yes. The one who Sian talked about is me. Hello. My name is Todd. As you can see, I'm a magician. Speed and smoothness are my skills. These skills are what Sian needs. Ow... He's not so good. What do you see in him, huh? Shut up and watch. Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh... If you could work the VIP table, we'll get at least 200,000 each. No. It's too risky. How do you know that the magician will work with us, huh? -I don't know, either. -What? -Damn, what an answer. -Here. Take it. What the hell is this? Leave it to me. I'm good at talking to people. You're good at talking to people? He didn't even listen to you. He'll be back. See? Hey, how did you know? I told you. Old man. Did you write this on my motorcycle, huh? I don't know. -Hey, clear yourself. -No. -I don't know. -Tell him. -Come here. -It's not me. No. Riang, you bastard. -Come here. -Asshole. The decoration is very neat. The customers will love it. It has a very nice atmosphere. You won't be disappointed. Mint. Hi. You're always late. This is Yui, the owner. This shop is the one I wanted you to see. Do you like it? It's nice. Nice shop you have. Yes. It's beautiful. Mint, may I talk to you for one minute. What is it, Todd? This shop probably costs more than three million, Mint. I don't have that much money. I already told you that I can pay for it. Or we can be business partners. How will your dad think of me? A pimp that sucks his daughter's money? If this is what you think, when will we make our future together? When will we get married, Todd? I told you, I need more time. More time? You've asked for more time for seven years. My dad's friend asked me to work with him in England. If we don't get married this year, I will go to England. At least two hundred thousand each for the VIP table. Interested? 087-335-9393 SIAN Cheating is not hard. But it's not easy to challenge Boss Pu. What plan do you have in mind? Don't worry about it. Riang has some friends who are working with Boss Pu. They will take you inside to play with Boss Pu. Then you will need to use your skills to beat him. Changing the cards in my hand is not difficult. But how do I know the cards are not the same as Boss Pu's. Don't worry. I have a plan to fix this. Boss Pu is a womanizer. So, we need a female decoy to look at his cards. A decoy? Who? I have someone in mind. Her name is Sri. I'm always afraid of that phrase. As I told you, I'd rather go myself. Because it's the old bar I used to go to. -Your turn. -Up to you. Today. Oh, damn it. Sniff it. Give me one. -Come on. -I'll take it. What is it? Take it. Hey. One, two, three, hey. -It hit my face. -In your face. There. That's Sri. -Which one? -The one with short hair. Damn, are you grilling chicken? Damn. You like her, don't you? Fair skin, pretty, sexy. My kind of girl. Do you think she will take a risk with us? Bastard. It turns out that Sri is not exactly a fragile woman. -You bastard. Follow them. -Follow them. You sons of bitches. You die! She is much more experienced than we expected. Come on. What a shame. I lost two matches last night. Here she comes. Here are your drinks. Ah, thank you. Hey, wait a minute. Bastard. Bastard. Shit. You made me bleed. You die! Hey, hold on. -Is your name Sri? -Yes. Here. Cover yourself. Damn. You're such a hero. Shut up and keep walking. What? You want me to be a decoy to cheat Boss Pu? Sri, you can't go back to work in that bar anyway. You might as well join us. What if they catch me? I'd be dead for sure. What a stupid idea. Sri, I won't let anyone hurt you. Believe me. Please. Damn. What a heroic thing to say. How can I trust you guys? Frankly, I don't want to die. Sorry. But... Shit. They didn't see me peeing in the street. Damn it. I'm all wet. What an unlucky day. What are you laughing about? I'm sorry. Pity me. Who's that? Oh, this guy? He's my uncle. He's the mastermind. He's too cute. Is this your decoy? -Yes. -Well. My name is Sri. I'm so glad to be working with you. Tell her that I'm as old as her father. I'm not her friend. -Look at her. -I don't think you're her type. Sri? Do you want to talk about the plan? Our first mission is to send the decoy in to seduce him. To woo him. Gee. Gosh. Boss, please come this way. We've been missing you. Where have you been for a long time? Which table do you want? How about this one? -All right. -The one you always sit at. Boss, don't be naughty. Come here, quickly. We've been missing you a lot. I'll get the girls for you. -Make it quick. -Of course. Give the boss something to drink. I'll be back soon. Tono, give me a drink. Here you are. How do I drink this? Here. How do I put the ice in, huh? Here you are. If you were not my wife's brother, I would have whacked you a long time ago. So annoying. Where are you taking my drink? Make up your mind. I already did. Uncle, there are plenty of sexy girls here. Are you sure that he will pick Sri? Oh, don't worry. I've prepared supermodels for him. OK. Let's see. Girls, follow me. Boss, this is Tiny. Hello, boss. Damn, they're really supermodels. Here's Lighty. Fluffy. All very pretty. You can pick whoever you want. Girls, time to work. -Yes, ma'am. -Hey. Hey. Get off me. Boss, I was just kidding. I'll find new girls for you. All right? Oh? Are you in a better mood now? I'll take her. Oops. It slipped. I found it. Here. I got it, boss. Can I have this glass? Take it, asshole. Don't be upset, boss. I'll make a new one for you. I don't want to drink anymore. Can you go outside with me? Uh... Boss. Don't be naughty now. If you want me, you must try harder. Huh? Please, leave a message after the tone. Mint, I love you. Please wait for me. Hey, Boss Pu has contacted me. He wants me be with him at the casino tomorrow. Our chance has come. Yes. What is it? Money. Here. A two hundred thousand loan. That's all I got. Everything. This is all I got, too. Thirty-thousand. Here. All I got. This money is the last money we have left in our lives. So, tomorrow, I don't want us to fail. We can't fail. We absolutely can't fail. Understood? Hey, Tono. Didn't you say there would be a master card player to play with me today? Where is he? This way, please. Boss Pu, this is Boss Todd, the one who asked to play with you. So, you must have some money, to dare to play with me. Not a lot of money now, but when this game is over, I think I might take some of your money home. We'll see if you can walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Uh, I hope you don't mind that I play with cash. I'm too lazy to change for chips. Huh. All right. Let's play something fun today. Let's play Thai Baccarat. I'll be the banker. Ten thousand per round. OK? Go, go, boss. I'll be cheering you on. Let's begin. Hey, where's my money, Tono? Now, you will have to remember the signals. We will use the finger. One is clubs. Two is diamonds. Three is hearts. Four is spades. A finger on the forehead means number one. Eyebrow is two. Eye is three. Nose is four. Mouth is five. Chin is six. Cheek is seven. OK? Boobs out. Get out? What about eight and nine? No, I mean her boobs are out. Geez. Watch your boobs. Aw, I meant to do that. She's working you, uncle. She's working you. Most importantly, don't make your cards too good. He will realize that you are cheating him. Then you won't come out alive. Go, boss. Let's see your cards. Natural nine. Six flush. Not a good day for me. See you another day. One point, but straight six-seven-eight. Time for me to leave. Thank you everyone. Huh? Huh? Nothing. Royal. Triple five. Stop dealing me crappy cards, all right? Calm down. Luck is something you can't control. -I'm not in the mood to play. -Hold on. Let's play one last round. I'll bet all I have. What the hell are you talking about? I've lost all I had. You still have the Somdej Holy Amulet there. Its value is about the same as this pile of money. Think about it. If you win this one, you will get your money back. It's win-win for you. Don't let him talk to you like this. Only a million or two and an amulet. You can't let him put you down like this. Only the brave ones rise to the top. Huh. What if I lose? That's your business, not mine. Go for it, boss. How could you lose the whole day? Moreover, if you win, not only you will get your money and keep the amulet, but you will also get my heart. Deal. You fooled me. I didn't fool you. Not you, her. She's got balls. What's the problem with having balls? Grab them. Stop. Everybody, stop. I will reveal everything. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. There are two exits. Close them off. I told you. I'll expose all wrongdoings, especially illegal gambling. This country needs a politician like me. Oh, god. Ah! Shit. Amulet. Boobs. They're OK. Whoa... it's high. Bastard. Shit. Damn it. Damn it. Shit. Geez... it's freaking high. Shit. I'm all bruised up. Shit. Ah's restaurant. Move. Cheers! Let's celebrate. Hey. I got it in my eyes. -So fun. -Come on, cheers. Hey, cheers. I couldn't be happier. You know what I'm most happy about? This Somdej amulet has returned to me. It's my whole life here. Hey, 500,000 each. Every baht is in here. All of it. Damn you, girl. Oh, come on. Hey, Riang. We got the money. Why do you look like crap? Leave him alone. He's heartbroken. The girl he had a crush on has balls. Damn you. Shut up, you bastard. Hey, it's the time to be happy, not for a soap opera. Stop being sad. Come on. -Hey, cheers. -Cheers. Hey, what are your plans for when we split the money? I'll open a restaurant. Make money. Save enough to marry my girlfriend. What were you laughing about? I will be packing my bags and flying to Korea. I'll cut off my balls. Cut off my balls. You don't need to do that. Just wrap them with elastic bands. Bastard. I'm a girl, not a dog. It'll save you some money. I say, let's go out somewhere to celebrate. -Yeah. -All right. Cheers. -Great idea. Let's go. -OK. It's done. Can you help me and buy the lottery ticket? I only have one left. THAI GOVERNMENT LOTTERY 2 MAY 2013 What numbers do you have? I only have one left. Please, help me. It's 55-66-77. This one won't win in a million years. Are you crazy? I'll buy it. Don't blame him, Sri. You should know that Riang likes strange things. Or else he wouldn't have had a crush on you. BANGKOK-POI PET You are stingy. I'd like some candy. Why? Do you want it? I only asked for one. I'll give you this. What is it? Oh! 55-66-77. -55-66-77. -You are giving this to me? Yeah, take it. Yeah. Todd, let me have the bag. Hey, are you OK? We've arrived. Hey. Throw it back. Hey. I think you're wrong to pull a scam on this casino. If we get caught, we won't be able to get out alive. Think about it. If we pull this off, we'll walk away with ten million. Ten million divided by four is 2.5 million. You can buy another Somdej amulet and open another amulet shop. Think about it. What are you talking about? How could it be 2.5 million? 4 5-95, 96-72, 42-78, 95-46. Each of you get 160. The rest is mine. So dumb. Where did he learn math from? From my mom. No wonder you're so smart. Hold on. Listen. The 500,000 that we have in this suitcase won't be able to make our dreams come true. Do you realize that? Right. Five hundred thousand won't do shit. At least you can buy a lot of shit. Don't say that. Money is money nonetheless. Come on. What do you say? Wait a minute. I'm thinking if I should drink this. I'm not drinking. Geez. Old people are so slow. Do you know why? For my Somdej amulet. For my boxing gym. For my loved one. For my fake pussy. There is Boss Chuchai. Normally, casino owners don't play with customers, unless they're VIPs. I also heard that he's a womanizer. Can you see his bodyguards? They're all his. Not too hard then. We'll use the old plan. Really? Hello, pretty. What? I'm not a whore. Get down. Where are you from? You don't know me enough. I'm sorry. -Bring her to me. -Will you do it again, huh? No, I won't. Next step. We will have to take this money, and sell my Somdej amulet, and exchange it for chips worth three million. Don't lose any of them. I have contacted my friend, who is a dealer here. He will arrange a VIP table. Then it will be your job to beat Boss Chuchai in his own casino. Oh, Sri. I have something for you. Take it. And this time, hide them well. Boss, the new bodyguard is here. You look sexy in this dress. It will be sexier if I don't wear it. Sit down. Boss, the VIP customer is here. Let's go. Welcome to my casino. I was told that you asked to play with me. I'm here to spend money. Why should I play with just a dealer? I like something more exciting than that. If that's your wish, I'll be the banker for you. I also like something exciting. Then, Thai Baccarat should be something exciting for both of us. Must be a fun duel. May I sit and watch? Hey, who made that sound? Have some manners. Hey, who made the annoying sound? It came from your ass. Our plan will be screwed because of your glue. Don't pay attention to her ass. Let's begin. All right. Well, I'm off to a good start. I hope you don't get a natural nine. I got seven. This is gambling. You win some. You lose some. That's exciting. Boss, why don't you take a peek? Boss, take a little peek. It's exciting to see it. Come on. I don't need to see it. It's more exciting this way. So, do you want another card? I'll have another. I got seven. Luckily for me that you don't get a natural, or I wouldn't get a chance to draw a third card. Let's see my third card. This is I what I call exciting. Are you ready to play another round? Do you want another card? What are you looking at? Never seen a vibrating phone before? Hey, really? Boss, your mom died. Huh? Your mom died. Let's go back to Bangkok. Right. Yeah. I'm still talking to him. -Really? -Really. Go. Do you understand? Your mom died. Hurry up. Boss. My mom died. I will have to go back. Hold on. The cards are dealt. It won't take a lot of time to check them. It's the last round anyway. Let's bet all you have. Do you want another card? So? Natural nine flush. Oh, my. What luck you have. Getting a natural nine in the last round. I give up. I got seven. Damn it. You cheated. I only use a single deck of cards. Where did you get another nine of Spades? You cheated. -Oh, shit. -Get out of here. Get them. Wait. You don't care to help a lady? Damn you. Hey. Open it. They're over there. Quick. Hey. Quick. You! Hey, hurry up. Move. That way. Quick. Sri? Where's Sri? I don't know. I was following you, not her, idiot. Oh, my purse. I have to pick it up. Split up and find them. Yes, sir. Where the hell are they? Find them. You can kill me but not cheat me. Check the cameras and find out who they are. You dare to enter the lion's den. Get out, you bastard. -You shouldn't have died so soon. -Don't worry. We will certainly bring him to his cousins in Thailand. As our slogan says, "We take great care of your body, even when you're dead". Give me a call if she's going to die. You're really service-minded. Get in the car. RUAMKATANYU FOUNDATION Hey, how many did we pick up? Only one. We picked him up together. Are you crazy? Really? Shit. I must be so hungry I saw an illusion. What do you have to eat? Peanuts? I know. You ate so many peanuts that you are nuts, huh? Then don't eat. All right. Shit. Why did it turn out this way? Oh, you son of a bitch. Why did you push him here? Asshole. I'm so sick of you guys. Damn it. If you hadn't taken me to Poi Pet with you, these shitty things wouldn't have happened. Bastard. Aren't we going back to help Sri? What for? She was the one who screwed up the plan. She deserves it. Hey, but she's a friend. Your friend, not mine. If you want to go back, go by yourself. Hey, I don't care whose friend she is. But please, can someone take care of this bastard first? He is stinkier than 30 rotten dogs. Damn it. Uncle, someone is calling. I don't have a phone. Riang. Is it yours? -The telephone. -I don't have a phone. Hey, whose phone is it? It's this bastard's. Damn it. He has a phone. Uncle, if you let it ring, we will get caught. Riang. You asshole. Hey, Riang. Not my business. Take it. Quickly. A dead man carrying a phone. Damn it. Damn it, bastard. His hand. Take the call. Hello. It's his daughter. His daughter. Hello. Oh. Really? You're in Udon? Oh, good. I'm OK. I'm sleeping like a dead man. Good. Yes. Good. All right. Yes. Yes. What the hell are you doing? What are you talking about? She asked if I'm fine. Mr. Saksri Klinhom. Now, are you going to tell me, you ladyboy, who sent you to mess with my casino? No one sent us. We took a van here. I want the money to cut off my balls. I don't believe you. Tell me now. Who sent you? No one. I don't believe you. Gee, I told you no one sent me. No one, you bastard. Maybe your dad sent me. I knew it. It was my dad who sent you. What an idiot. Not believing the truth, but believing sarcasm. You won't admit that you work for my dad, will you? Then I'll have to play hardball. Ah... boss, please. Please, let me go. Please. I'll do whatever you want. You can't seduce me. Why? Because I'm the same as you. What about the female bodyguards that they say are your concubines? They're the girls in my control. They are my little sisters. Asshole. Why didn't you tell me earlier, so I didn't have to seduce you? -You old fag. -How dare you. I'll taser your balls for that. Go ahead and do it, so I won't have to waste money to cut off my balls. Just do it. I'm ready. Electric shock doesn't work. A ladyboy like you deserves this punishment. What? Acid? No. No! Please. Acid is too barbaric. You deserve this. Mustache lotion. RUAMKATANYU FOUNDATION Damn it. All you do is eat and shit. Damn. What did you eat? Where's the lighter? The driver probably got off to pee. I really need to pee, too. When will we get to Bangkok? It's very risky. Be patient. You were the one who told us to get in this car. Asshole. Why don't you take my place? Try lying down next to this bastard. He's stinkier than 30 rotten dogs. Goddamn it. What are you praying for? Your amulets are all fake. Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, huh? Do you still dare to say anything? It's all because of you. My Somdej amulet is lost because of you. Moron. Is it my fault, huh? -They're back. -Bastard. How dare you to say this to me. Whoa. Asshole. Hey. Did you buy some sweets again, huh? I hear noises like mice in the back. No, I didn't. Are they eating the corpse? -You go take a look. -Always has to be me. Calling me again.

When you're done, take a look in the back of the car. See if there're some mice. I don't want mice taking my car. How could mice take your car? -Shit. My car. -The mice really took the car.

Are you asking for trouble? Bastard. You wild animal. You look like a dog's testicles. Shit. What did you say? Why did he smack your head? I asked him where Sri is. Maybe I got some words misplaced. I'll try to calm him down. -I'll apologize to him first. -Good. Apologize to him. You mother dies. Riang. What the hell was wrong with him? I was very polite with him. Enough. Just leave him here. Let's go. Your birthday present is here. Hey. What are you going to do with me? Let me go. Who's this freak? Have we met before? I hope not. Let me go. We've met in my dreams.

Which question do you want me to answer first? In my purse. In Boss Chuchai's room. That bastard put mustache lotion on my face. -Go. Let's go, asshole. -OK. Bodyguards in front of the room. Must be Boss Chuchai's room. Hey. Sri, I beg you. Please, don't show your face near me. I'm not used to it. Why? Oi! I think we should go for the purse. How could we get in? Hey, you have a gun. Just break in. What are you afraid of? Damn, you cruel ladyboy. You want me to shoot ladies? Uh, you don't want to shoot? I'll do it. Give me the gun. -Huh? -Give me your gun. Quickly. Take it.

Why the hell are you standing still? Help me. What do you want me to do? Think for yourself. Yes, sir. Asshole. Why did you shoot at me? Do you want to kill me? You told me to think for myself.

Hey, why are you still standing here? Go help the boss. Why should we go? Haven't you seen in the movies? The underlings of the antagonist always die. Hey, what about the boss then? He told us to think for ourselves. We should let him think for himself. You work for my father, don't you? Your father. Yes. My father. Father my ass. My father hired you, right? My ass. Why should my father hire your ass? What are you quarreling for? Huh? He asked for trouble. I say let's kick him out of the car. Wait. Calm down, Riang. Wait until we're in Thailand.
