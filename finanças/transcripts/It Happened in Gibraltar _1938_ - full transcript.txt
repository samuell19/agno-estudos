You still intend to keep Brigitte for yourself? Whaddaya want? I like her! She's sweet, obedient, faithful. I could take care of her as well as you do. Ah, but first we'd have to know if Brigitte wants to leave me. She loves me! Whaddaya want, it's my fetish. With her, ready to sail. She'll eventually get bored with you. Say, doll, she never told you that! Seven schillings. Five now and two next pay, okay? Seven schillings? That's a good amount. Brigitte! Come, pretty, come! Brings good luck. Oh, she's pretty! I keep the beast, the luck I share. Oh, she's so intelligent! I taught her a ton of tricks, you know. "AFTER THE YORKSHIRE, THE HAMPTON" "New maritime disaster, the "Hampton" just blew up" "Destroyer "Hampton" blows up in the Mediterranean" "ACCIDENT OR ATTACK? THE "HAMPTON" OFF GIBRALTAR" "VICTIM OF AN UNKNOWN SUBMARINE? Was the "Hampton" torpedoed..." "TENSION IN THE MEDITERRENEAN WAITING FOR THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICE" "THE ROUTE TO INDIA THREATHENED?" Gentlemen, all of our attention must be focused on Gibraltar. This is the second ship carrying troops and munitions to Hédrar that blows up! After the stopover in Gibraltar. Major Rogers, what does the Intelligence Service think of these mysterious accidents? An attack that's certain. It's clear that we're dealing with a powerful organization. Disciplined by an important and well hidden leader. And unstoppable. That we will stop. Let's hope so. Because another ship, the Imperia is heading to Gibraltar with 2000 English soldiers. And if those attacks continue, the Hédrar will be cut from the metropolis. That's exactly the pursued goal. Forces from the Intelligence Service are in action. The Governor-General of Gibraltar has received all of the necessary instructions concerning the appropriate security mesures. Furthermore, we have an advantage, the range of our search is clearly defined. Gibraltar, because of its isolation, is a suitable place for a secret activity. And on the opposite side there is Tangier. This international city is full of spies and adventurers. Our agents are looking after it. In close collaboration with those of the Second French Bureau. We've already lost two in this exceptionally difficult affair. Hello? Yes. Major Rogers, it's Tangier. Hello, hello? It's one of my best agent, I was waiting for his communication and I allowed myself to get it through here. Academy of Science of London? Yes, it's me. It's professor Galloway. Professor Galloway, yes, I'm calling from Tangier. I've just found out a new variety of Katakanto Sankorego. A very rare insect. And without fault, my dear colleague. I'll study some complementary detail and send you my report. Believe me. Gentlemen, I think we just scored a goal. - Good day, M. Maori. - Good day, Paul. What can I do for you today? Ah, my little Paul, I don't need your service today. Just a manicure. Manicure! Miss Nelly! Beautiful weather, ain't it? A small sea breeze which cools the atmosphere. Yes, very pleasant. - Hello Mr Maori. - Hello Miss Nelly. I'll do your hands? I came for that. - Good day Mrs. - Good day Mr Marson. I introduce a friend. - Pleased to meet you, Mrs. - Mister. - Madeleine? - Here Mister. Good day Mrs. If you'll follow me... You look great! It's my pure conscience. You were up early today, M. Maori. Yes. I had to accompany a friend that was leaving for a great trip. Oh, travelling. I love travelling, M. Maori! And you? Depends. Nelly? You whose English, help me please. Give me the name of an English zoologist of 8 letters, with a L in the middle. Marconi! Continue, my child, continue your work. English zoologist? Galloway! Professor Galloway! Galloway, Galloway... - G-A... two Ls, right? - Yes, two Ls. It can work. - Thank you Mister. - No problem. Is he still alive this professor? Oh no, I don't think so. I'm Florina's representative. Can I see Mister Marson? I brought the sample you wanted, M. Marson. Come with me. The Imperial will stopover at Gibraltar, Tuesday at 3. It will have no communication with ground. You've understood Gentlemen. Those mysterious attacks are directed against the security of our Hédrar troops. And I ask of all vigilance at every seconds. Strict implementation of the instructions I'll give. Lloyd! The secret service's note, please. - Here. - Thanks. Major Nichols! Census and surveillance of the civil population and immediate expulsion of all suspected foreigners. Holmes! Night and day control of the coast inside the limits of the admiralty. Jackson! Jackson? Absent? Regular leave, Lloyd? He's in Tangier, sir. He's in Tangier. Yes sir, in Tangier. - He had health issues. - Yes, health issues, we'll see about that. Kershaw! You are responsible of the security service of the Imperia. Gentlemen, you're free. Lloyd, two words. He's becoming impossible your friend Jackson. He drinks and gambles. He mocks discipline. He must remember the respect he owes to the uniform. I assure you sir, I'm doing all I can. In friendship, one never does enough. Come quick! Come! This health story. Do you take me for an old beast! I assure you sir. I sleep next room to Jackson. He moaned all night. He has a raging toothache! I'm the one who'll end up raging! You're still proud of him, Sir. He's your best head of batteries. 3 years, nothing has changed... Naturally, Robert Jackson has been acting up! Maud! Good day, mon petit papa! I thought you arrived in two days! I'll tell you, it's a great story! I've come driving from Spain. Spain, these days! Yes and I travelled from North to South I was arrested, sequestered and released. My car was shot, I was given flowers and here I am! She finds that funny! - Oh Claude! - Hi Maud! I didn't recognize you, you've grown! The little girl has sprouted! And our little Jackson still makes rude jokes? It's his teeth that are joking! For the moment he has inflammation like... Lt. Jackson open this door immediately! You think that because I had a whim for you 15 days ago that I'm at your disposition? Well, mon petit, you'll return when I'll tell you. In the mean time, let me out. Not before you've told me yes or no? No, no and no! You won't get me, I guarantee it! If you think you scare me, you're mistaken. And it's not over! And now! You'll have the honor to applaud and hear the senorita Mercédès Garcia in flesh! A small cry of love! Joke's over, let me out. The public has been waiting for 1/4 an hour! And me, 5 days, nine hours. And 25 minutes. Mercédès! Mercédès! Mercédès! What d'you want? I want you to stop offering yourself,for me to have to take you back the day after. Looks like you're trying infuriate me! Many times! I know a lot of man who'd give a lot for only one day or one night. I know, yes. For example, the South American, the one with more rings than fingers! I know, he's already in the audience, your lil' peanut planter. I can guarantee one thing, he won't take you back tonight! What a terrible child! He's an impresario. Ah yes, an impresario. I assure you! He's offering me a tour in London, Paris, New York, a tour of the world. You won't leave, right? Unless you know how to keep me here. - What you've got here? Did I hurt you? - What? Let me see. I adore peanuts! Ah, you're there? Look! Good day, Mrs, Misses, Messrs. I'll allow myself to interpret a little romantic romance. The nightingale that singed. Deep in the night Gently, the garden falls asleep What lover in the world... What's with you!? Hijo de puta! You say? I can translate if you want. Please do. Son of a bitch! Check the altitude! In bursts of three! Very well done the rectification of the line of sight. Hello, Sir. By order of General Wilcox Do you authorize me to transmit a message to Lt. Jackson? - Please do. - Thank you. We'll continue without you. Here Lt., take comand. Something serious to tell me? You're disgusting, you didn't come to the meeting of the Staff. What did you do? The old man was furious, I had to invent something. I told him you had toothache. If it was only the teeth it'd be nothing. It's all of my head that aches! I got so drunk last night, you can't imagine. Got into a fight, wonderful! What's less wonderful is how you treated Maud. - What? - I invited you both. Has she changed? Extremely! To her advantage? Check the altitude! In bursts of two! You my boy, you again lost gambling. Not again, always! To who do you owe? A guy who'll go see the general in three days if I don't pay. Saddens me for the old man. He's a brave guy. Anyway. Listen Robert. You know I've always helped you. But this is too much. I'm doing you a great disservice. You gamble thinking I'm there to get you out of trouble. Well no, pal, not at all. Listen. I'll help you again this time, but you have to promise... I won't promise anything. I'm not asking for advice, but for money. You won't give me any, that's all right. I'll find it elsewhere. At your service. By order of the governor, every officer must consider the stronghold as under siege. After the lost of two ships, the most severe measures have been taken for the passage of the Imperia. In your case... Hey Jenny, ain't go no permission to leave. Oh Jenny, permission to kiss another! She's my sister! She's the commander's cook. Hey, cook, leave the commander and enlist with us! Hello, Angelina. I'm here for Mercédès. Always gracious. What is it? Senor Jackson! Let him enter. Wake up! I was sleeping so well. You've come from the market? What brings you here? The desire to see you. An irresistible desire. So I didn't resist, here I am. Here's diner at home! Caviar, cold chicken, strawberries with cream, "Fine Champagne", extra dry. Nice, eh? We'll have a picnic at the edge of your bed. Good day. What time is it? Eleven forty-five. According to my watch. But according to my stomach, much more. Eleven forty-five? I must get up I have an appointment. What? If you want to dine here Angelina will dress table for you. I don't care about your appointment. You won't slip by me today. Pass me my stockings, will you? And my bathrobe on the chair. Do you take me for your dresser? If my dresser had your manners I wouldn't keep her. Give, give! Makes no sense. Makes no sense! You stand in front of me worse than naked like I was an object. And now I must help you dress to join another man. Sometimes it seems you're looking to get hit. Don't get mad at my bathrobe, I'm not in it. Listen, Robert. When I don't spend all my time with you, when I'm not at your entire disposal, You yell, you get angry, you doubt of my... let's say, affection. And yet I do not believe I have been costly. Is that a reproach? No... The proof that I love you, the best. So be reasonable, understand! I cannot sacrifice my life, my job, my friends for you. What would you give me in exchange? Nothing! You have only debts! Only your uniform. Which suits you well, you were wrong not to wear it today. Thanks. About my uniform. I'm afraid I won't keep it long. The guy to who I owe money is starting to chirp. And if he goes to the general, anything could happen. I don't know what to do. Unless a miracle. The real tragedy is that you have passions beyond your means. Whisky, gambling... And the most expensive of all... Mercédès. And I am expensive, my dear Robert. You don't know it yet, hum? Very expensive. Yet I wanted to keep you very much. Keep you for long. I like you so much. You're right Mercédès. You are... Far too expensive for a petty officer. And because I do not accept you as alms. Thanks for the lesson. Robert, don't leave! I say stupidities, you too you say stupidities. Both of us are stupid. I love you, that's all. Robert... Too bad for the appointment, let's eat. I'm so hungry! Just my luck, you cut my appetite. - Don't worry I'm hungry for two. - Really? I forgive you. - That's why you were mean, huh? - Yes! Quick, now the aperitif. Here. Fruit juice. Very healthy! If you really liked me, Robert, If you wanted... If I wanted what? We could fix everything. We could live happy together. I wouldn't have to make you jealous. You would make me jealous for sheer thrills! Listen, really. I know how. A man who'll help you. He'll pay my debts? There's the miracle! Listen. We'll be happy. He'll give you money, a lot. A rare bird! Patron or sponsor? And I won't have to do anything in exchange? I didn't say that, no. You'll have to give him some information. As lover of Mercédès. Hum? As an English officer. I think the Admiralty's new code would interest him. The code 17? Yes, that's it. You know, nobody will know. And there'll be money, a lot. You'll do it Robert, won't you? Robert! Robert, think about it! I'll wait for you here, tonight after the representation. Bravo. You made some progress. Not badly played. If it's actually played, but... What do you think? I think you went too far and that we won't have the code. You think? Don't worry, I know him well my little officer. He'll be back. I don't doubt it, he'll be back to... to sleep with you, that's all. You must never mix work and pleasure, never. Especially in our line of work. And if you do it... Too bad for you. You'll end up, without a doubt, before the firing squad. Like all of your kind, that's all. Because you, you don't mix work with pleasure... But... that's not the same thing. Oh please... You prefer the (german word) Look at him, he's dying of jealousy. You're right to drink, makes you forget. I understand you, she's charming. Ah dear Lloyd, why aren't you dancing? What a magnificent evening! Hard to believe we're at old Wilcox's place. Yes a magnificent evening. A night of ball in Gibraltar. Rumor of the sea, odor of jasmine. Muted music. Under the protection of the guns of his Majesty. Very reassuring. Very romantic! When I was little I dreamt of all this. Of my first ball dress. A real ball dress. Like mine tonight. I dreamt of walking side by side with a nice partner. - Like me tonight? - Yes. In dark garden paths. While far away a ship passes, all lit up. He took my arm, spoke to me tenderly. The ship? Oh no, you're impossible. Not me! Childhood dreams. They are never realized fully. You have the setting, but the character's missing. Come on, Maud. You don't imagine this old cynic Bob speaking tenderly to a young girl. Yet you did it so well in my dreams. Me? The partner, that was me? It was you Robert. As you see my children's eyes and as I see you still. Your cynicism, a mask. But I know what you are. Are you certain, little Maud? Or what you could be. But you must known this lewd Spanish woman? No? It's true? Yet Jackson is your friend. He shouldn't have secrets for you! Come, come, tell me the truth! What can we do, us poor honest women against these creatures. Nothing! Oh Robert, close your eyes! Make a wish. I'm obeying. Why? A shooting star. We almost made the same wish. Why almost? Look at Robert, he's dying of jealousy! You're right to drink, she's charming! Jackson! One of your friends came to me about you. You know what it's about? Yes, sir. This case must be resolved before tomorrow. Say, I fear Lt. Jackson will soon be forced to give back his spurs. The old man didn't look so happy. He also wanted to borrow money from me. And you did? A blind man cannot show the way to another blind man! And you're laughing, you're not mad at him for all he did? He's lucky to have a friend like you! I can't be mad at him. Well, I'd scold him! Where's that unbearable kid? He must be playing a trick on us. Hello? Yes, Sir! Hello? Yes, I'm General Wilcox. What? What? Stop, stop! Ladies and gents, sorry to interrupt this evening But a great tragedy has happened. The Imperia blew up! S.O.S. From the Imp... eri... a. 45... At... 2... 20... S.O.S. We're starting to sink. We're sinking. Discipline on board. God save England. Pray for us. I knew you'd come. Try to capture the emissions of ships in the vicinity of the Imperia. A French ship, the Admiral Courbet is calling the Imperia. - Machine three thousand rounds! - Machine three thousand rounds! The rescue station in fifteen minutes. - Yes, commander. All the rowing boats at sea with men onboard. Ready to come alongside. - Machine at 3005. - Machine at 3005. Call to all. To all. To all. Here is Admiral Courbet. Here is Admiral Courbet. We reached the Imperia. Very agitated sea. Rescue operation difficult. Here is Admiral Courbet. Here is Admiral Courbet. Call to all. To all. To all. Here is Admiral Courbet. Here is Admiral Courbet. Imperia; 9 dead, 17 wounded. The rest of the crew is safe. Admiral Courbet; 2 dead, 5 wounded. Going back to Toulon. Going back to Toulon. Going back to Toulon. Here is Admiral Courbet. Here is Admiral Courbet. Please, gentlemen. And now, to the health of Major Rogers who comes from London to visit us. Gentlemen, to the health of my hosts. Gentlemen, I ask everyone to leave their glasses and not to touch them. And not to leave his place. Mj. Rogers from the Intelligent Service will explain immediately. A grave act of treason has been committed in Gibraltar. In this very room the Code 17 was stolen, one of the most important for national defense And the culprit can only be in the entourage of His Excellency the Governor General. We have no evidence other that the fingerprints left on the safe. You understand, gentlemen. None of you may be offended by this process. I'm sure, that the traitor is not one of my officers. I myself insisted that all my immediate staff be exonerated first. In the name of his Majesty the King and by decision of the military court in Gibraltar, the artillery Lt. Robert Jackson, convicted of spying for a foreign power, is sentenced to military degradation and 20 years of fortress. Good job, I congratulate you. Pleased to see you, Mercédès. But always at your place, never here. Never, under any pretext. I prohibited it, don't forget. But they sentenced him to 20 years! You don't care, of course. A finished man doesn't count, one more that's all. Why finished? Jackson is 25. 20 years of fortress, that makes 45. A good age. He'll be released fully mature. Snicker, I know your cruelty I should have thrown you out the day I met you. But this time you won't get away scot-free, I want you to get him out. That must be easy for the great Marson! I want him, you hear! I want him! His slap decidedly produced a great effect. Fortunately for you, I'm not jealous. It's not about jealousy, but pity! Only that feeling for a Marson... oh dear! Do you have any pity for the poor men blown up in the sea? Not at all! Only one interests you. That's all! And you can't have him. I found him a replacement. Another officer, also in financial difficulties like Jackson. Just as young, don't worry. From who you'll have to get some information. No. It's over. I refuse! I had enough of your dirty work, I won't do anything for you. You'll do everything I ask of you, and more. You'll be exactly like other men and women in my hands. Nothing more than this doll. You don't really know Marson yet, Mercédès. What he wants, what he can. An adventurer, of course. A great adventurer. I was an officer with honor under the flags of Austria, Mexico and United States. I was a diamond miner in Timberle. Gold digger in Alaska. Pimping a girl in Marseille. Right arm of war minister in Nicaragua. In 1925 I was pushing scum in Brazil to revolt against the government. All alone! In 1927 I put the King of Cambodgia back on his throne. All alone! And tomorrow maybe I will raise Arabia against England. All alone. You'll see blood and fire in the Hedrar. I play with people's destiny like the cat play with the mouse. I'm facing all the powers in the world. All of them! And now I find the situation rather amusing. On one side : England's High Naval Ministry, His Royal Majesty's Navy and Military Intelligence Service and the most inscrutable fortress in the world, Gibraltar. On the other side, a hairdresser, a simple hairdresser in his little shop who makes the Empire quiver. Me, Marson. Eric Marson. Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? I'm sorry. No. Your accomplice, allright. But your mistress, never more. I was your friend, Robert. and I don't believe it. Tell me the truth. Come on! For what, for who did you do that? Don't you want to talk to me? It's all I can do for you. Come on my darling! Be patient, maybe he will be pardonned. You know very well he won't. You want me to be brave. But I won't forget him. I will wait for him. You'll wait for him? Yes, daddy. Because I love him. Officer on duty immediately took measures in response to the escape alert. Alert escadron and observation posts to stop all passer-by. Verify their papers. Yes of course, motorcycles too. But you must not shoot at Robert Jackson under any condition. Don't shoot! Do you hear me? That's an order. He must be captured alive. Robert, my darling! It's you! But how did you do? Did you escape? Not at all! The guard of honor accompanied me through your door. Now you have what you wanted. I'm all yours. I'm free and here in Tangier I can't be arrested. And I have a few plans of my own. I'd like you to introduce me to your boss. My boss? It's the only way out in my case. No, Robert. I don't want you to meet him. He's a monster. Why? Oh, my darling! I already have so much remorse. To put you in such a bad jam. Yes, I understand. I should have guessed that a long time ago. After the love comedy, the remorse tragedy. After using me, squeezing me and having me emptied! Now I'm just an outlaw. You give me up. Robert. Always the same, Mercedes. Promises you can't keep. What a lot of grudges! There's one grudge you could not hold against me anymore. Come in. Come in. Johnny? Obama Johnny. John. Not masculine enough. Long time ago I had a friend. We've had an argument and he didn't survive. His name was Charlie. Charlie is fine with me. That's it. Charlie. Mrs, it's a great honor to introduce our new collaborator, Mr. Charles Brent. Mr. Brent? You don't know many things about me. But I know a great deal about you. You betrayed, forgive the bourgeois expression, you betrayed your country. And your country wouldn't appreciate your freedom of thought since she tried to deprive you of your own liberty. If you betray me, Marson, it's not only your liberty at stake. From now on nothing you say, write or do, will stay unknown from me. During your trial period, I'm placing you under the special protection of your co-associate, Mr Maori. I'm honestly warning you, Mr Maori has a a deep hear, a piercing eye and a sure hand. I was sad without friends. You will replace poor Charlie. Charlie the 2nd! But no argument between us. It's my hope! It's loaded. What should I do? What you did when soldiering, obeying to orders. And you were an artilleryman! You surely didn't damage much of your targets. Look! Here you are! Now let's practice on a moving target. Get the pigeons ready, my boy! You first! Too much sensibility! Killing him would make me ache. What a delicate and tender heart! Killing a pigeon would make you ache! How touching! And it's been 8 days since Marson hired you. I think you're seriously going to need my lessons. I think alike. Fire? Sorry, I'm so clumsy. Go take care of Cabin 7. I'm taking her in charge myself. This bun you have is a model of grace and sensuality. It's done. I hired your protégé. Are you satisfied? You should be too. You found yourself a more reliable and useful man. It's probably in this end that you asked me to take care of him. How disinterested of you! Your heart was not at stake. My heart! As if one could keep a heart near you! To the facts. And this new bracelet? Always the same platonic fan? Yes. A gift to the dancer, not the lady. Nice trinket. All the same, it's strange, a man making a 20.000 francs gift and asking for nothing in return. Very, very, strange. It confirms some intelligence given to me. You will find a way to show him to me during tonight's representation. I'm drinking to the health of the platonic fan. You don't know him yet. According to reliable tips this platonic fan was sent directly to us by the Second Bureau. Now it's your turn to watch him. Don't miss him. Did you forget my specialty? I apologize, Maori, but I won't do it again. I'm not an assassin. But you must become one before I give you an important assignment. It seems logic! I can give all my trust to a murderer wanted by the police. You understand, Charlie the 2nd? You're right. Where's the man? We're going to know that at once. Decode the morse and you will know his place. Second box after left entry. Hats off! In front of 500 people! It's a good trick, isn't it? -Understood? -Understood. Look at that! You here? So, what's your opinion? Not bad for a debutante. But next time shoot directly from the inside of your pocket. Like that, you see. It makes a hole in the lining but it's less noisy. Maud, don't you want to swim? Sportswoman like you are and you're afraid of cold water? When I wanted to propose you a 100 meter crawl competition. But where are you? I met Robert here for the first time, the day after my arrival. Maud, you have to forget. But I can't. -Have you already forgotten him? -No. And you know that. For you he was a playground camarade, a childhood memory. A dear memory. For me he was much more. He was my best friend. I loved him like a brother. He doesn't exist any more. However we have to live. There's the sky. That small passing cloud. The sea at our feet. I see your eyes Maud. Your smile. I like your smile so much, you know. Yes, this one. I would give anything for you to be happy. -You're a swell guy, Frank. My big brother. -Yes, you're big brother. Nevertheless, I wanted to tell you since a long time... It makes you laugh? Instead of monkeying you should have watch his glass. He's completely drunk! Not that fast, for heaven's sake! Not that fast! Come on! Pedal to the metal! You're crazy both of you! At least, respect other people's lives! He's afraid! -The cops! This time Marson will catch the fine! -If they catch us! It's the first time I wish to be arrested! Come on! Faster! -We've made it. We lost them! -It was a close call! Don't worry. With me nothing to fear. I could drive with my eyes closed! Doorman, a room with shower. A nice room! He was driving at 150 mph on the road! We followed him throughout the city! He had an accident. He put all the souk in shambles! Tomorrow for my breakfast I want ham & bacon with whisky. And wake up call at eight sharp. Go on, write it down! Get the hell away from me, you! And don't touch me! Your name? Your name? Charles Brent. Charlie for friends. Brent? Charlie Brent? I will do the interrogatory by myself. Follow me Hey doorman, don't forget. Eight sharp! Over here. Step in. Lieutenant Jackson. On behalf of His Majesty's government, I'm in charge to express the deep gratitude of England for your sacrifice and his admiration for your magnificent courage. Thank you, Mr. -I hope I'm not too late. -Come and let me introduce you : Commandant Ramiro Sanchez, Chief of Police of Tangier's International area. Lieutenant Robert Jackson, 4th regiment, Royal Artillery. On special assignment. We have already met and I'm glad that our Intelligence Service could get some help from a collaborator like yourself. Misters. Here I am! Bravo for...! -Hello, how are you? -Good in spite of everything. General, I introduce you to my most valuable collaborator. Capitaine Dumas from the french second bureau. Decidedly, my dear, you have a grief against me! At least you're skillfull. Except that today I needed more skill at wheels that the last time with the gun. By all means, it was a great pleasure to see my assassin face to face. Did you have to swim for a long time? Until the docks. Too bad for my hat. I lost it. -A real stetson, all new. -A thousand regrets. Now Lieutenant, we're listening to you. Messrs, the assignment I was given... Yes, with the car. But we need money for the bail. Immediately. He must be released before the interrogatory. Perfect, Mrs. I take note of your order. The necessary will be done. My compliments, Mrs. As you can see, Messrs, our show worked to the perfection. I'm today an active member of our enemy organisation whose Marson is the leader. All my suspicions have been confirmed. He's dealing arms for Ben-Saïd who is planning a revolution in the Hédrar. He's using a clandestine TSF transmitter to communicate with him. On the 36.00 wavelength. It's urgent for all TSF operators, including yours, to keep their ears on this wavelength day and night. -36.00 ? Exactly. There's still a detail unclear. Is Marson really responsible for the sea attacks? I think that all military convoys to Hédrar should be stopped. Until I find out the bombings method and their motivation. But we can't abandon the Mediterranean sea to Mister Marson! Speaking of that, The City of Cambridge will leave England in two hours. The Lieutenant's "friends" have just brought the caution. I will be forced to release you, to spare them a long wait. To be held in a Police Office because of this stuffy kid! -Leave me alone! -Easy to say. Meanwhile, you put all of us in a tight spot with your Romeo. If we get out of here without more trouble we could light a candle! What a pity! If it was for the sake of a real man! -Meaning a man like you. You're jealous. -Jealous? If I was paid every time a love of yours ended in two days. No need to stir up bad memories. What's the matter? -I have something to tell you. -I'm listening. I would like for Maud to know. Me too I would have liked. It was a great pain for me to hide the truth to her. But orders are strict! Outside this small circle nobody should know. She loves you, Jackson. And you love her too, aren't you? She believes you're innocent. May your trial comes to an end very soon, my boy. So you really think he loves you? So you really think you know something about love? I always had a bad feeling about him. He doesn't seem very clear, your gentleman. Don't play Othello, it doesn't match with your looks! Like it or not, he loves me! He adores me, he's mad of me! You 're a pain in my ass. Understood? Ok, ok, we'll see. Don't bother! I know my way out! Thank you for the good treatment! I'll send friends of mine! -It took time! -It was such a long time away from you! Excellent Hotel! You two should pass a few days here, it's charming, delicious... 50.000 for bail. Or you would still be in jail. I thought I was more expensive. Angelina! Someone's ringing! Very good, those sausages, huh? You wouldn't taste them now if you had stayed in jail. Angelina? You're deaf? Did you really want me to spend the night in jail? No. I bet you it's Maori again! He's worse than glue, that one! What a brute? The bell will be ruined! Maud! You were not expecting me. Sorry for my loose shirt. Can you let me in, please? If you please. That woman. Is she here? -Which woman? -Please, Robert! Do I look like I'm afraid? Do you think I could ignore her? So you knew about her? And you came here. Yes. Of course you can't understand. I love you Robert. I came to tell you that I don't think you're guilty. Tell me the truth. Only you could convince me. I'm guilty. You're lying. I'm feeling a mystery, a mistake or something else underneath. I need to know. Neither mistake nor mystery. Only the truth according to the Martial Court. -I betrayed. -It's not possible. You lied that much to me during all that time? When I thought you loved me you cheated me then? Robert, why did you do that? For who? For that woman? For that woman. Yes, little girl. And because he loves her. Don't you, Robert? My darling. It should be clear now. Split at once. Do you hear me? Get the hell out of here! What are you waiting for? Run with her! Scram! All the while you cheated on me with another girl! Mr likes them by pair! I'm not satisfying you. You need a virgin! You should have explained yourself. Me too I was seeing other men. I have all the choice in the world. How you mocked me in the end. You're just another scum. Robert, I'm sorry! I'm so jealous! It was like receiving a dagger in the heart when I saw that girl. Nothing in common between the two of you. You, you don't like me. Why do you say that? You're very dear to me. You're the only man I could live with day and night. -Come with me! Let's go! -Where? To do what? -Where you want. Just to run away from Marson. I'm afraid, you know. For the sake of both of us. Marson is a monster, a madman. Don't you know the terrible game he's playing and his crimes. Marson's a criminal? It's a laugh! He's a snicky wig maker, nothing more. A little bit of spying. A little bit of arm-dealing. No big deal. No big deal? Hundreds of deaths? Thousands maybe? You won't make me believe it's him blowing the english ships. But it's him all the same. I swear it's the truth. Which way? I don't know. But I swear I'm telling the truth, Robert. Let's run away! If he learnt I told you this he would kill both of us. Or someday the English will learn the truth and we'll be hanged! But I want to live, to live with you. If, according to you, Marson is so dangerous, he will search for us, he will get his revenge. -No, he will let us go. I know it. Or else! Or else? "Mercédès Garcia will give a farewell representation" Dad, I hope you will support my decision. I'm engaged with Frank. Frank? He's good, loyal, he's a trusty friend. A charming comrade and an excellent officer. Where could I find a better husband? What you say about Frank is true. But if you loved him you would say something else. You don't take an husband like you take an insurance, to act wisely. You're not marrying with Frank, you're marrying against Robert... ...because you loved Robert. Let's not speak about him, never more! For me he's buried. I'm engaged with someone else and I'll marry him. The sooner the better. At the end of the month, if you agree. In two weeks? Impossible! -Why? -Because it's impossible. It's too soon. In a few months if you wish. My little Maud darling. I'm asking you very nicely to grant this delay to your old daddy. Maybe you'll thank me then. Tonight, Messrs, we must be shining for Mercédès last show. May she leaves with good memories of us, her past pretenders. She's taking Charlie with her. That's enough already. -I'm counting on it. And where are the newly wed spending their honeymoon? -You're getting married, Mr Charlie? -Yep. So young and already lost. All things get to end. Is Mr Marson here? So you're going around the world? Three times. Please send me postcards! -Color or Black & white? -I don't look at them. It's for my stamps collection. So you're going to put a show with Mrs Mercedes? "City of Cambridge - 20PM - Gibraltar" I'm going to park the car. What's up, Charlie? Hello? Attention? Tangier Police? Robert Jackson here. Wavelength 36.00. Robert Jackson here. Wavelength 36.00. Urgent communication. Suspend loading immediately... Cut off. I don't understand. Explosives in coal. Evacuate the ship. Tonight at 11 PM. All the band reunited in Bataclan. Surround Bataclan. I will command operation myself. Here you are! It took a long time for you to park the car. Since I've been introduced to the police they make me run through the streets. They chased me from four different places tonight. With a wet eye and a shaking hand I drink to our lovely friend's departure. To her futur successes and to her futur happiness. Her figure will stay deep in our hearts as... deep in our hearts as... You know what I mean! I'm leaving. I have to dress. Already? You have a few minutes left. You can stay until the end of the interval. No. Tonight I got to look my best for the farewell show. Nobility carries obligations. You? I wanted to say good-bye to you. In private. I wish that you always wear it. And I hope that it will make you think of me sometimes. Hello? Give me the Bataclan. Mr Marson, a phone call for you. Very urgent. You have the line in the corridor. Allo? Yes? Hello Dan. Brent betrayed us. He sent a message to the City of Cambridge and to Gibraltar. He warned the police of Tangier. He wants to arrest all of us in the Bataclan. But I could unplug. They didn't receive the message. Brent is a... Dan? Hello? Dan? Bitch! Dirty bitch! Now I understand. You betrayed me to escape with your gigolo. What? What are you saying? Don't act so innocent! You're going to tell me all you said to him before I'm strangling you! You're crazy! What's the problem? Explain yourself! What? You didn't know anything? I didn't know what? What is this all about? Speak! Tell me! Your man, "reliable and useful", is a snitch. Mercédès, quick, on stage! On stage Mercédès. Give him his last dance. On stage or the audience will demolish the furniture! What are you doing? Pass me the castanetas. What does it mean "Marson knows everything" ? Bad luck Maori. You're going to lose another good "friend". Before I kill you, learn this : your message didn't reach its destination. Jackson! I tried to send a message by radio but I couldn't. Inform the City of Cambridge! Explosives hidden in coal! Quick! Pass on to first lieutenant! Explosives in coal! Lieutnant! A message! Explosives in coal! Stop the engines! Stop steam boilers! Stop! Explosives in coal! Stop! Robert... Are you hurt? Could we leave tomorrow? We must leave all the same. If you knew? I know. Yes, I know. You fooled everybody. I know you were forced to. But the two of us. It was real. Say, it was real? Of course, that young girl. She was nice. She loved you too. But we will leave, the two of us... Won't we? Yes we will.
