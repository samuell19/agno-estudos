Sir. Which way to Kirklees? My thanks. If we can get the gable up and the canvas over before nightfall, We'll have shelter of sorts. It's a new start for us. You'll thank me for it. We'll dine on finer fair tomorrow. Mark my words. Thank you for coming to our aid. I wouldn't have asked but winter overtook us and we were desperate. - I'm sorry. - Rebecca, no. - Stop that, stop! - Run, run! Run! The new sheriff might turn a blind eye to poachers, but the King's deer are my duty, and you've killed your last one. Take him, lads! Stand up, you fools! Get him! Come on! Damn. I am impressed as always, Lady Prioress, with your commitment to the task at hand. One would be a fool to ignore the changing seasons, Your Grace. Winter bears no love for the unprepared. Indeed, Your Grace. Come, come! Enough chattering! Faster, please. We have much work to do. Where were you? Sister Agnes is on the warpath again. Give the world your burdens and the Lord will take care of you. Sister Matilda, where have you been? Your duties have been found wanting yet again. I'm sorry, sister, I lost sense of time. If you are too lazy to plough, do not expect to reap the harvest. Quite why the good Lady Prioress accepted you into the novitiate, I will never know. Sister Agnes. Messages, sister, from Nottingham. - Thank you. - Oh, there is another. - This is odd. - What is it? Never you mind. News for higher minds than yours. - Sister Gaynor. - Uh, thank you. Sister Barbara, two for you this month. And even one for Sister Matilda. The day is getting stranger. I wasn't aware you kept correspondence outside of the priory. Only you and our good Lord, Sister Agnes. Lady Prioress. - A message. - From the sheriff, my lady. Father, have terrible news. Lady Prioress, I was just, um- - King Richard, Lord bless him, is dead. Killed in a siege in France. That's terrible news. Naturally, that means the war is over. Most likely many of his soldiers will return home to see their loved ones while they can. Won't you think? I wouldn't know. Sister Matilda, you've been with us for how long? Three years this past October. Three years. Yes, that would be about right. And in those three years, I've watched you go about your prayers and your duties. I've watched you every day, and on each and every one of those days, you have borne out that which I suspected the very first time I laid eyes upon you. I wouldn't know what you mean. Sister Matilda, of all the ladies who have taken to the cloth, you are by far the worst I've ever seen. There is no hope for you. You were never truly here to serve the Lord. You've been marking time, pacing the clusters like a caged animal waiting for release. - I'm sorry, I- - No, I'm sorry, Matilda. Sadly, the only solution when dealing with such a poorly-suited candidate is dismissal. - You want me to leave? - I do. I would order you to gather your belongings and leave immediately, but I see you are already prepared. Good. - Lady Prioress- - You are free, Matilda. Go and find your soldier while you can. Quickly before Sister Agnes tries to mend you ways again. Lady Prioress, I don't know how to thank you. Well then don't. Is it far? Um, Ashgate. I meet him by the ruin in Ashgate. Uh, I don't know the ruin, but Ashgate is a tidy way off. Best you hurry along now. You spent enough time in this old place, Matilda, go! Uh, thank you. Thank you. - Marian, wait! - Robin. What was that? Oh, what was that? Three years! - Ooh! - Three years! Oh my God! All Bible studies and prayers whilst you follow Richard to paradise! What can I do? He's the king. You left me to rot! You should've sent for me! How could I? We were fighting a war! We're in a foreign country, hundreds of miles away. And I promise you, it wasn't paradise. I would have gone for you. I know. And I'll come back for you. Uh! I always wondered who lived here. Besides us, you mean. You know what I mean. Way back in the past, someone built this place and maybe lifted it for silk trees. But now look at it. It's just tumbled down and forgotten. Just lost in the woods. Maybe no one except us will ever notice. Even here. Sometimes things are better lost or forgotten. True. You know I'm sorry, don't you? I know. I didn't wanna leave you, but I just... Duty. Kings. Holy wall. You gave me that speech at least four times before you left me for His Royal Highness. He was great man. Well no doubt about it. Warrior King. A lion among men. From the minute that royal fool arrived, - I knew you'd leave me. - How? He had that same mad look in his eye. The same one you have when there's even the slightest chance of danger. Hey, come on. - When did I give you that- - Please. Every time you're up to your neck in it. And I was there to pull you out and patch you back up. This time he took you somewhere I couldn't go. It was fine. I, I'm fine. I wasn't. So what do we do? You ever thought about becoming a nun? I heard they're - crying out for them. - Oh, really? Mm. Silk robes, and a wimple, necklace. Was it bad? The biggest danger was dying of boredom. Well, look, that's behind us now. Listen, Marian, Richard gifted me with land in France for my service. We can build a house. We could buy pigs, cattle, maybe some sheep. We could get married. The legend of Sherwood Forest, herding sheep and cattle. You'd be the worst farmer ever. Oh, the worst farm in the west and in it together. - Yeah. - It was truly meant to be. - You heard me, huh? - I heard you. And? You really would make the most beautiful nun. You should consider it. Little John came back with me too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Uh, he said he'd meet us today up at the old cross. We're thinking of visiting Alan-a-Dale up in the north riding for All Soul's Day, and then maybe getting a boat south. Well if we started up there early this morning, we could make it there in good time. I hear he's planning quite the reception. I'd expect nothing less. It would be good to see him again. So you'll come? To France? I don't know. What is there left for us here? Let's go to Alan's and find out. Find out what? See if things have changed. What things? Do you mean me? What? What was that? Outlaws, most likely. This place is crawling with them. You're such an idiot. I need to clear my head. I'm gonna go down to the stream. Okay. I'll get out some food. Oh, bring back some water. Yes, sire. Robin! Robin. Soldier! Over here! - Come here! - Uh, no! Get off me! Get off me! - Marian! - Robin! Get off! Well, good rescue. Good escape. Where are we? Who are they? I'm not sure. Uh, maybe mercenaries. - We need to get out of here. - How? Marian! Let her go! Shame. Bring her. No! No! - You'll regret! - No! Girls are a lovely hunt! Hold her! Thank you, Guisborne. I'll deal with this. Sheriff De Wendenal, please, whatever you want, just leave her alone. Sheriff? Gosh, it's been a long time since anyone called me that. What do you want? Why have you returned? Three years I lost to exile. I had everything. And then you and your precious king took it from me. What we did was right to take your title, De Wendenal. You reap the rewards of your own corruption. Do you know when I was in exile, I was dogged by tales of Robin hood. Every inn in every town. I thought that I would never escape you. Until now. It's over. The legend of the bowman dies today. Misfits Walter. Do you know, I did think about letting her go before, but here she is, back again. You never did know when to walk away, did you? Get it over with, William. I'm so sorry, Misfits Walter. It won't be over for a very long time. - Stay still, girl! - Leave here! You can struggle all you like, but Robin hood is going to watch every single cut I make and listen to every single scream. Guisborne! Duck! Whoa! Whoa! - You all right? - Never better. Marian! - Uh! - Robin! Get up! Get up! Well don't just stand there! Get them! - Move, move! - Go, go, go! After 'em, after 'em! Go, go! Just do it! Just do it! Go, go, go! Here! They must be close. Spread out. Search everywhere. Come on. Get up. - Over there. - Okay. They must be around here somewhere. Keep searching. - Sorry. - How bad is it? - Oh! - You know the answer. What's De Wendenal doing back? I thought Richard banished him. That means he must have got back after the king's death. With Richard gone, who's powerful enough to stop him? - We need to move fast. - Look, we stick to the plan. We head east to the old cross and meet up with Little John. We can be at Alan's by the solstice and in France in two weeks. He'll never find us. They're gaining on us. They'll be here any minute. You have to go. - No, don't be stupid. - They'll see us if we run. And I won't make it. Go! No! We go together or not at all! - Take off your surcoat. - Okay. You gonna tell me what you're doing? - You're going for a run. - Oh. - You ready? - Always. There! Go! Find them. Find them! Wait. Wait. We need to stay off the main road. - This way. - Sir. Every time they run, they head east. So? So, they're trying to throw us off. Take two men. The rest of you on me. Stand aside, friend. I said, stand aside. We have urgent business to take care of and you are in our way. Go around him. - I don't think that's wise. - He's one man. What can he do? This is your last chance, friend. Take him down. - I need a minute. - Are you all right? Yeah. - Hold it. - What? You're late. Little John! What happened to him? He looks like death warmed up. - We're in trouble. - Less than you were. Here. - What happened? - De Wendenal. - What? - Apparently he holds a grudge. We need to move fast. It's a long way to France. Oh, you'll never make it, old friend. - Look at the state of you. - We can't stay here. It's not safe. I don't think we have a choice. - He needs to rest. - So what do we do? - Run! - Guys, I find him! Come on! - Go! - Come on! See you later, Marian. Put him on the bed. Shh, shh, shh, shh. - How are you feeling? - Just look at me. I'm done. No, you just, you just need to rest. What if they come for us? I can hardly raise my arm let alone a bow. They won't. We're safe here. Oh God, we should have gone three years ago when we had the chance. I should never have left you for Jerusalem. You came back. And what I wanted. You wanted a grateful pig farmer. I guess that's what you've got. You should try and leave while you still have the chance. I'll never leave you, Robin Hood. Get some rest. Maybe tomorrow we'll find a brighter disposition. We're in trouble. This place is well-hidden. They've never found me here before. Yeah, you didn't see De Wendenal. He's not gonna stop. We need to get down to the Hughes. They'll patch us out on the next ship. That's 20 miles. Maybe more. Robin's not even gonna make it 20 feet. We need to find a way. Can you get us a horse and cart? Maybe. My cousin owns a farm down by the lea. It's gonna be a few hours though. I need to buy you some time. Go. Thank you. We lost him Yes, I can see that. They had help. A big man. Another outlaw, I guess. John Little. Be thankful it didn't turn out worse. Which way did they go? - East. - To the river. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. They ambushed us. We didn't have much- - Yes, I don't really care about that. We just need more men to get ready to march. So Fitz, fetch six men and grab the throwers. Meet me by the high road. Ganger, just get everyone else. - Now! - Yes, My Lord. I don't like this. Find him! Find him! There! Move, move! After her! Move. De Wendenal's gonna get us killed. Uh! You all right, sir? Get me up here. Robin, where's Little John? Well, I dunno. I thought he was with you. He went to his cousin's to get a cart. I thought he'd be back by now. How are you feeling? Careful. Yeah, maybe I'll stay here for a moment. Best not to rush. Agreed. I'll make you some food. It'll do you good. I'll make a broth. Where were you? I went to see if I could convince De Wendenal's soldiers - to leave us alone. - And did he listen? I think he got the picture. With any luck, De Wendenal will crawl back under his rock and give us no more trouble. He should know better than to venture into our territory. You hear that? It's Little John. Come on. John. I'm sorry. Run for it! Get inside! What now? I don't know. Robin Hood! Come out. I have you trapped. How did he find us? I have no idea. Don't try me, outlaw. I am not a patient man. If you come out now, I'll kill you quick. I might even let your lady go free. Come and get us, De Wendenal! I was rather hoping you'd say that. Bring up the throwers! - Move, move, move! - Come on, let's go! Bloody set it down! Come on! Let's go, down! Good! - Come on, wind it! - What's that? Nothing good. Come on, wind it! Ready to go! Guys go it? We need to run now. I can hardly stand. When you're ready, lads. Ready! Release! Get back! Release, Release, Release! You go. - Release! - It's me they want. How many times before you listen? I'm not leaving you. They'll advance over on us while our heads are down. We need to slow them down. - Release! - With what? Release! - I can get you out. - What? How? - Release! - Just trust me. I can buy you time. I'm not leaving you either. If we both leave, they'll catch us both. No, they'll kill you. Yeah, kill me, maybe, kill you, definitely. Look, get out, get to the river, and get to a boat. I'll meet you at Tuck's. And I'll marry you. Okay? Don't do anything foolish. I just said I'd marry you, didn't I? What's the fool doing? Stop her! - Reload! - Shoot her down! For God's sake! Marian. Wait. - No! - He's down! - Get after him! - Go! Get up! Come on! Come on! - I'm all right. - We need help. You leave, I'll follow. No, come on! Get up! Sister Agnes! Sister, please! He's dying! Whatever you've done, Matilda, you cannot bring it here! De Wendenal is back! He's trying to kill us! The old sheriff, why? This is Robin Hood. Jesus, Matilda. You've just killed us all. Be gone! No, you cannot refuse us! It's your duty! You have to grant us sanctuary! Sister Mary, prepare inside. Thank you. Clear the table. sister, clear the table. - Careful. - Thank you, sister. Careful. Sister Mary, bring hot water. You're okay. We'll need to get it out. Matilda. What's going on? I don't even know where to start. The young fool has brought death to us. No! Sister? William De Wendenal is hunting them and your prodigy has brought him straight to our door. He's dying! I didn't know where else to go! You did the right thing. We'll be gone as soon as we can. You won't be walking anywhere for days. This won't do. If William really is coming here, we need help. Matilda, De Lech, the new sheriff, is hunting near here over by the old kirk. He will have no quarrel with Robin, and he was loyal to King Richard. Find him. - He will know what to do. - No, I'm not leaving Robin. There is no one else. I'll be okay. I'm in safe hands now, go! - I'm not leaving you! - I will look after him, Marian, I promise. I'll be okay. It is done. Well done, sister. I feel I've done more harm than good. No one could have done more. He's in God's hands now. Thank you, Lady Prioress. - You should rest now. - I need to stitch the wound. Oh, sister. Mary will do it. She's good with a needle. I shall watch over him. There's nothing more you can do, Agnes. Call me if he worsens? Of course. Go now, sister, with my blessing. Thank you, Elizabeth. I've never met an outlaw before. Fascinating. Fetch needle and thread, sister, quickly now. Prioress Elizabeth sent me! I need to speak to the sheriff! - He's resting. - Then wake him! - This is important! - He will not be disturbed. - Get off me! - Step away! May I assist you, madam? Who are you? I'm Simon. I'm the warden here. I deal with matters whilst the sheriff is otherwise indisposed. He's resting at the moment. A late lunch always sends him off to sleep. Is there something you need? Prioress Elizabeth sent me. William De Wendenal is back. - He's trying to kill us. - De Wendenal? Why? Who are you? I'm Marian Fitzwalter. A moment, please. I'll wake the sheriff at once. De Wendenal is back. The exile De Wendenal is here? Yes. He attacked us. He's pursuing us. He intends to kill us. Arrogant cur. I will string him up if I get hold of him. My betrothed's life is in danger. Your betrothed? Robert of Loxley. Robin Hood, the wolf's-head? - Yes, sir. - Ah. Well, I can see why his life might be in danger. De Wendenal has good cause to hate him. He got what he deserved! Please. We took shelter at Kirklees's, but if he finds us, he'll kill us. We need your help. Well, there are many rich men around here who would gladly see Hood dead, but De Wendenal, he cannot be permitted to flout the king's law as he sees fit. We will help you. Thank you, sir. There are not many of us here, madam, but we shall ride at once. - Thank you, sir. - Guard? - What? - Bring out the horses and ready my armour. - Simon? - Yes, Lord? Send a rider to the nearest Garrison. Bring troops to Kirklee... Uh! Stop! The soldiers are on their way. Murderer! - I had no choice! - What do you mean? They have my family. Who? What are you doing? I had no choice. What? No. Marian, what have you done? Guards, guards! I found the assassin. - I didn't do anything. - Quickly! I struck down her accomplice! They tried to kill me! I tracked down her accomplice! Seize her! Seize her before she kills again! This way! Over here! Come quickly! Something is wrong! Where's Robin? Is he all right? I left him with Lady Elizabeth. She said you would watch him, but now the door is locked and she doesn't answer! Robin! - Why would she lock it? - I, I don't know! Prioress! Elizabeth! Step back. Robin! We have to do something! I don't now. I'm afraid it may be too late. - We have to try! - I, I, I'll fetch my medicines. All right, hold on. Agnes! Whilst we are sinners, Christ died for us. You're a murderer! Sometimes, yes. Other times, I have help. Isn't that right, cousin dearest? Elizabeth. - What are you doing? - I could have pursued Robin all across the Holy Lands, but I thought it easier if my cousin nurse made you for his inevitable return. Where else would the lovestruck fool go when he came home? How could you? Blood is thicker than water, Matilda. Robin humiliated my family. He has to pay the price. Give me the sword, girl. Robin lost. It's over. Give me the sword. Such a shame. Take her away. William! It's just a scratch. Get after her! You'll have to do better than that, Marian! Kill her! Well let me fetch you bandages. No, it is done. I must go. What about Marian? Who cares about her? What harm could she possibly do us? You have work to do. Of course, cousin. Who's there? Sister Matilda? Come, closer child. I assume you have good reason to be abroad. Uh, Prioress Elizabeth sent me to the, mm, for the justice, I am... I lost my way. Forgive my appearance. I'm glad to have found you. And you haven't been back to the priory? I haven't. That's probably for the best. What happen? Nevermind. Lady Elizabeth should know better than to send a new visit on official business. Well these are difficult times. They are, father? Forgive my intuition, but might I have some of your food? Yes, if you insist. Thank you. - Brother Common? - Yes, father? Meat and drink for the sister, Common. Yes, father. Brother Common at your service Uh, Sister... Matilda. Sorry, I had a hard journey. My provisions were stolen. You must join us. We've business in the morning, but once it's done, we would gladly accompany you wherever you wish to go. Thank you, brother. Brother Common is misguided in his promise. We have much work to do, and we can't waste time mending your mistakes. Brother, I need to prepare my readings for the ceremony. You will see the sister fed, and then you will guide her to the high road. But father, surely it's dangerous for a lady to be alone on the road. If she wishes for our help, do not permit a woman to exercise authority over a man, brother. We have great works ahead. You'll have to find your own path home, sister. My apologies, sister. The Abbott has much to contend with. No matter. I'm grateful for Your Grace's kindness. Tuck, what are you doing here? Robin's been captured. - Robin is dead. - What? De Wendenal killed him. Uh, are you sure? A messenger came to the abbey, hailing De Wendenal as a hero. He tracked Robin and trapped him at Kirklees's. They claim he killed one of the sisters. No, De Wendenal attacked us and slew Lady Agnes in cold blood. Robin is alive. I'm certain. No, I saw him with my own eyes. There was no life in him. You are mistaken. Marian, they're going to execute him tomorrow at dawn. - Execute him? - Yes. And John. What, what have I done? I shouldn't have ever left him, I- - There, there was nothing you could do. Where, where are we? Uh, near Ashgate, maybe five miles. Ashgate. By the ruins. Yes, yes. There's enough armour buried there for small army. Alan in isn't far from here. And Will Scarlett. If we go, we can do this, we can, we can go- - Marian, you'll never make it. It's pitch dark. Just wait for me by the high road, and I will come and find you when it's done. - It's, it's over. - I'm not giving up on him. Marian, we'll be killed. What could a fat old man and a girl do against a private army? The only thing we can do, try. Marian! All quiet, Ganger? Yes, sir. Stay vigilant. This won't take long. Then we'll move out. It's healing well. Thanks to your skill. Is all prepared? The barons are compliant. They will follow the money. As always. And the Abbot? Eustace has been reminded of the damage he would suffer should word of his indiscretions reach the senate. And I am assured the final piece is on its way now. You've done well, Elizabeth. Come! Speak of the devil and he shall appear. Simon. Good of you to join us. I would not miss this day for anything, My Lord. Do you have it? Of course, as agreed. And with this, the undertaking is complete. Save one thing, dearest cousin. Hmm, indeed. Welcome, Abbot Eustace. I thank you for answering our call. It is a privilege, Prioress, to bear witness to an event of such import. My lords and ladies. We are gathered together to bear witness to the rebirth of my family's honour. Once the deed is done, we make for Nottingham, where my cousin will reward you well for your loyalty. Perhaps a few words for your honoured guests, sheriff? Let's just get this over with. I have scores to settle in Nottingham. Of course, cousin. Guisborne. Your skills are indeed remarkable. Robin, gladdens my heart to see you on your feet. William, it sickens mine to see you still standing on yours. See you in the next life, old friend. I spent every day of my exile contemplating your death. I had dreams that I pursued you to the ends of the earth and tortured you in a hundred different ways. But now that you're here, I realise that all I want is you gone. Your precious king is dead. And in a moment, you will be too. And I will be free to do whatever I want. Have you thought of becoming a nun? Such a fool. Just do it. Cut her down! We have to help her! Don't forget the task in hand, cousin. Robin Hood must die. Too late, Wolf's-head! The legend of the Bowman dies today. No! Yes! Stay down, little man! If my cousin can't do the deed, I'll deal with you myself! - I thought I'd lost you. - Huh, I'm good. Where's De Wendenal? He went that way. Marian don't. Just let him go. This ends today. Right, let's go. Yes. De Wendenal! You never learned to walk away. Did you? Nottingham is mine. Your star is on the wane and mine is in the ascendant! The Bowman is finished! It's so pathetic what some people do in the name of love, but that is the weakness of your sex. And that is why you will die. Think on this in your prison cell. Everywhere I go, every inn, every town, I will tell of story of Robin Hood. Everyone will know the legend of the Bowman and you'll hear his name every day until the day you die. Marian! Oh, oh, you're okay. - Yeah. - You're... Are you okay? So what do we do? Look for trouble? King John. Well? De Wendenal is dead. Hood killed him? No, sir. Marian. Assemble the men, sheriff. We ride to Nottingham.
