- Are you ready for the Revolution? - This is the story of how the Money Zombies used our band's music to murder 99.8 % of Earth's population! By now you've got Altered Foods in you. The Riddim is in your blood, in your soul... The music will set you Free! - Who you think you are, Sid Biscuits? - Dear Leader! - Oh, Donald Gecko. - The Douchebag? sheeppsyches! Focus. - At the dawn of our existence, in order to Live, we hunt and gather Food... In time we evolve, raising animals, planting seed, not to save nature, but to save ourselves. - Liberate tute me! - Masters of the land, we grow restless. We want more. Enter the City. - The life, the glamor, the glitz! - And the Schlitz! - Moving on up into deluxe apartments in the sky higher and higher towards Heaven. - No farms up there. - No, in the City, only firms. Unlike farms, a legal fiction, a human Frankenstein, with one goal. - Money Zombies! - Yes, and these Money Zombies talk. They say they own the right to Life. They say they are Creators! - Eff that! - But they are mere Mortals cutting corners at our expense to prolong Death... In the mid-90s, they even began to Alter our Food. - When the Savior killed himself... - When the music lost it's Soul. - They say you are the ill and diseased. Their Poison is our Cure? - Like we're crackhead? - Don't blame them. We made this happen by relying on our eyes. - Instead of our I! - To Life the Life of god, we must Live the Life of sheep! Not Altered beasts. - Say no to that Zombie flesh! - Sheep! Providers, economic grazers, who band together and thrive in difficult conditions... Sheep... The big apple of god's eyes! When comes the Inferno, who're you gonna trust? The firm? - The farm! - Or are you gonna be sheeppsyche! - God's I's! ♪ I see through much different lenses ♪ ♪ Put down all my defenses ♪ ♪ Are you feeling lost now ♪ ♪ Did no one fall in Love with you ♪ ♪ Come close my Rasta, I sacrifice it all with you ♪ ♪ A god who knows his i's ♪ ♪ A god who knows his i's ♪ ♪ A little spice! ♪ ♪ A god who knows my eyes ♪ ♪ And no one else has eyes, quite like mine ♪ ♪ I start to see much better with you ♪ ♪ Every time, every moment it was you ♪ ♪ I think I've figured it out ♪ ♪ I'm much stronger, now no longer in doubt! ♪ ♪ Give up my independence ♪ ♪ Want to smell your seven senses ♪ ♪ In this thunderstorm I can't help it, but I fall for you ♪ ♪ So stop now surrender, ya gotta know I know the truth ♪ ♪ I cannot compromise ♪ ♪ And make up alibis ♪ ♪ So then I close my eyes ♪ ♪ And start to fantasize ♪ ♪ And then I realize ♪ ♪ A girl who knows my I, such as mine! ♪ ♪ Mm, kinda see much better with you ♪ ♪ Every morning, I know that it is you! ♪ ♪ Let's put this bitch to rest ♪ ♪ I'm all on it son, now don't you forget it! ♪ ♪ Set off in stormy weathers ♪ ♪ One who yields us earthly pleasures ♪ ♪ I don't know, I'm all crazy yeah, ♪ ♪ I can't understand myself ♪ ♪ So I've got to be humble yeah, ♪ ♪ To the one who knows this well ♪ ♪ A god that knows my eyes ♪ ♪ A god who knows my I, sacrifice! ♪ ♪ A god that knows my highs ♪ ♪ A god that knows my highs! ♪ ♪ Then I open my eyes ♪ ♪ And then I realize ♪ ♪ A girl who knows my highs ♪ ♪ A girl who knows my high, satisfies! ♪ ♪ I start to feel much better with you ♪ ♪ Every night, every moment, it is true! ♪ ♪ Let's set this bitch on fire! ♪ ♪ All over, now I know that is right! ♪ - It's the anniversary of September 11th. The Web is under attack by a dormant worm. All online electronic history is simply deleting including emails, spacebook, and social media pages, and cloud-based storage in platform release. I repeat! The Cloud is evaporating. - I want off the Web. - The only way out is into the Web. - Let me get some of that shaiza. My Warrior. - I thought I was Chosen One. You are... And soon you will be reborn. - The Zombie? As sheep. - Sheep? - Don't forget Ricco... Sheep possess a certain joy of Life. Death is not the end of the World. - Yo. You got really good shaiza! Ah, my poor little Simbi Zombie sister... She's broken the shackles of the K-hop industrial concentration complex But a Zombie once... A Zombie forever. In this Alternative Universe, there is no Future except in Death. The sheeppsyche guys wanted me to give JB a shot. Or... Was it the Grand Xombi who brought us together? I always thought I was an only child... The Voodoo child. What was the meaning of our Lives? Blood? Or Money? In JB's case, she hoped our music would finally set her Free. Fidelio. You're late. So far! Yo, we don't like to go in the City if we can help it. I thought you played a little bass. I play double, upright! This bass is uh... DOA. - Is that a full? - That's a three-quarter. - Seven-eighths. - It's a full. - So you can Play a full? - I show you. - Where'd you learn how to Play? - My Father. - That bass is sick. Let me see that. - Okay, so you can Play. Lot's of people can Play. Machine can Play. - Music is my Life-Blood. It's my Food! - Oh? So why you join K-hop then? - They know how to spread my music global. - Do you write? - I write. - No, you don't write. They tell you what to say, even how to move. You, just the Zombie. - What? Zombies eat people. - If the Zombie eat the people, how come they only eat a little bit? They don't eat the whole thing, that's so stupid! - Ricco, man you said you Love K-hop! - I said I Love the ka-yo in the early 90s. After the group HOC, now her generation... Only sell, no Soul. K-hop's the Zombie slave. - Ricco's a purist. - For us, music is precious. - Are you the Hipster? - No such thing as an Asian Hipster, okay? - Why? - The only Hipster is Caucasian. They're always hungry for new culture. - Chick bassists are hot. - Hey, what's wrong with your face? - Ricco! - It's okay. My manager. Because I speak my mind... They burn me. - You're infected. - They tried to kill my career! - She's one of us, Ricco. - Ricco! Yo, let's try a jam. - Once infected...

Yeah, who are you? - Why sheep? - We're all lambs to the slaughter. - You said sheep. - Lamb, goat, sheep, same shaiza! Ram, mountain goat... - You. - Ewe? That's a good one. - Yes, ewe looks like. Where's bass, with big hair? - Cancer fairies. - Huh? Is he home? - He's dead. Oh... Yo, you know us? - Yes, the music video! I like it a lot. - Who are you? - Nirvana-Lover. - Are they your favorite? - All my favorite bands are Dead. - Sammy D. - JB. - Yo, I'm doing meetings in places like this. Oh, boy. - Trust me, this place, global. - It's freakin' Jersey man. - Erzie's from Jersey. - That's why Erzie freaking leave! Allo. Humans call me Dominoes. My card. - Sammy D. Ja-El. JB. And? - It's Ricco. So lovely for your visit. - Thanks for calling us. You are Legend. I've been watching you since season four, "K-Star Universe." - You've been watching me? I almost let this little one get away. She didn't want to Play man's game back in Seoul. Ah, you'll fare better here. Didn't know she played the upright. Yes, indeed. How's Life on the outside, JB? - I like. - Yo, this is a K-hop thing? - Personally, I dig the reggae. - Reggae! - The ancestor of rap and rock, infectious with the dance, the healing power of Riddim. - Sammy D used to play in the Underground. - Noise. - The noisy Underground way back when. - Don't you know being young ain't so cool anymore? - Yes, in my line of game, yes. And I search the World all over. - How old are you, Dominoes? - Born early, dear. - Real early. - Dominoes, Love you and your stellar track record. Absolutely. - Listen you guys, you have heart, but you need brain. Didn't you watch MTV growing up? You can't do it only with audio. You need Video, you need to be seen! - We made a Video. - You call that a Video? You have to make people hungry, appeal to their primal instincts. - That was primal! - What services do you provide, Dominoes? - You might have preconceptions, but we make sure at all costs that you are seen. - So you think we hide? - We don't hide. Our Worldwide Web's the plague, baby. - That's a good thing? - Even in the news, you can't just report. You have to... Thrill the masses. They're ravenous! - What are you offering, Dominoes? - Join my stable of acts. - What's your return on Views? - Ah, now you're gonna speak for the band, JB? - I speak for sheeppsyche. - Let me say something. - Ricco! - Why not jump aboard the mainstream for once? The Revolution has barely started! - She's done all streams. She knows! - What does it pay? You keep 60 % minus expenses. - Unsustainable. Dominoes, we don't need Labels anymore. - We're Digital Promotions. - Even better. Let's go! No rush. - Hit you later, Dominoes. - Yeah, hits you later, Dominoes. - I won't be offended if you guys come back. - Goodspeed, Dominoes! - Please don't blame them. They don't know any better. I take full responsibility. So you know, don't you JB? - Yes? - These men, you control. You control. And I will Heal you. - They don't think, just react. I cannot stand the Asian Zombie! - JB's Asian? - They tell you what to do, how to think! That's why I like here in Brooklyn. Not too many Asian. - What your your i tell you? - Real Foods is taking forever to open in Hipsterdam. - In the Valley, we could grow our own Foods.

Hello? - How's your nuts? - Tender. That's the gentrify. Rich and poor, clash same place... It's a warfare. I used to judge... I obsess the Money, the status. They have no chance, no hope. But they don't know yet. When they do, no more words... Revolution. Protect yourself. - You have options. You can make money as medicine man, lawyer... Business man. Why music man? - Music Heals our Soul. When I close my eyes, I hear these ancient feelings... There's something bigger out there. - But this music not mainstream. - When you were a K-hop Zombie slave... Did you do any improv? Any solo? - No improv, no solo. - See? Zombie got no solo. Zombie got no i. - No, later. - Who was that? - Froogle. What did Froogle want? - Drone-call man, I can't turn off all these alerts. - Are you sure it's Froogle? - Yo, I know how to use the Web Ja-El. - Everybody Zombie, little bit. But if you self-aware, maybe you can do redemption, like a Shawshank. Otherwise... You already Dead, baby. - I not Zombie. - You the Zombie, big time! After come Inferno, only Artistes are reborn Ximbi Xombi along with the Grand Xombi. - Who's the Grand Xombi? - Exactly. I will lead you on right tree. Then maybe you, be my... Ximbi Xombi Xister? - Wanna check out Shenanigan's later? - No. - Come on! - You let us know what you think, we already know what. Shut the Hell up, I'm over that dance hall. - Come on. - No Shenanigan's! Eff that dance hall! - Hyung? - What? - What if I sing? I'm more of a singer. - You... Were raised on auto-tune. - I not Zombie! - A good leader knows when to follow. Another time, maybe... Next Life. You eat it. - No, you eat it. - You eat it. If you eat it, it's like I eat it. Dad, you're my best friend. That's it. Eat. Eat it! - Ricco. Ricco, Ricco! Ricco. - Long night. Skal! - Execution Rock! - JB you know how the Rock got the name? - Torture. - The Redcoats used to chain Revolutionaries there and watch the tide come in above their heads. - They colonized Sammy D's people too. - We used to jam there on special occasions. - Gnarly. - Now we are our own I's. - Still scrapping. - Ricco, making the Money doesn't hurt. - It will hurt later. - It hurts now! - Sheeppsyche's goal is to vanquish the Blood-sucking vampires like Dominoes. She's just faker. We are Makers. - K-hop is blowing up. We have a Free ride. Look at Psy, look at the "Gangnam Style." - No Free lunch in Free market, JB. You learn that in University. - Yes, there is... IRL. - You think we are the power-full, but we are the power-less. Anarchy is the marketing for the Caucasian. We are underdogs of the Underground. - JB, can you get us some more milk and honey please? - Now? - Milk and honey JB, it's in the fridge and on the counter. Give her the code. Give her the code, man! - Where are your parents? - In transit. Locked up in some business. - When are they coming back? - Indefinite. - Dude, we're not getting any Views! - Views? Of all the stupid things? - We shouldn't just play for ourselves. - That's how Evil spreads, trying to get the Views. - That's how Good spreads too! - Where is she? Jo Bin, Jo Bin, Jo Bin, Jo Bin, Jo Bin, Jo Bin, Jo Bin, I Love you Jo Bin! - I Love you too! I Love you all. - Kafka! - Lone wolf? - Kafka! Kafka. See? She has a master. Don't you, little puppy dog, hmm? Kafka! - You said you trust in the process. Am I, is Sammy D not part of the process? - You are my sheeppsyche. - I can't Live on a saying, bro. I have to eat to Live. Sammy D's family too. - Ja-El! I wanted you to know the truth, but was afraid it kills you. But I told you because I decide I believe in you! - Then believe in me. Selling is not selling out. - It's just a party, JB. She's just Playing. - Party in spa? - Welcome to Comfort World where there are many ways to relax. - Drink this. - In this World, people go flapping about morals this, and justice that. At the end of the day, who's got the nuts? It's the nuts that get it in the end. It's all about the nuts. - Nuts? Nuts? Nuts? - So where you going, toots? Somewhere with the girls, huh? - Noots. Nuts. - Yes, yes, that's what you need! - Jo Bin! Come down here! JB... Lay down. Close your eyes. JB! It's so hot! - Mostly Asian. - Where's Dominoes and JB? Have you seen this girl? - Hmm, no. - I'm going to look over there. - Hey, no men allowed. - We need to go inside! Ricco, Ja-El, I think I found JB! - Now you see, Ja-El? I told you. - Her face! - She's been bewitched. - Dead weight! - Hey, remember kid, if you wanna make it in this World you gotta have nuts! - You have eaten the flesh. You have drunk the tea! All your senses are awakened by untouched nature divine! In the name of the Grand Xombi... You may Arise. - How do you feel? - Alive. - Are you okay, JB? - All right. - What did you do with Dominoes? - In many ways relaxing. I laugh a lot. - What happened to your face? - Mud cells Heal! - What is that? - A gift. They call it... M and H. - Milk and Honey? - Try. No smoke, no burn... Pure high. - Natural? - Uber natural.

See, I'm always on a journey. On the hunt for the next big thing. Let's take a look around. I'm a wildlife explorer, but of Food. Welcome to Zeve's World. It's like a Shanghai crepe. Crepe, crepe, crepe... All right, thank you. Yeah, enjoy! - Yo, this guy's got an awesome Food show. - I just ate him. Lobster. Beef. That's crazy, man! Lobster claw, lobster claw, lobster claw... Nowadays people are concerned about what they eat. They say they can't afford to eat natural. Is it natural? - It's natural, yeah. So it's the eggs from his farm and... - Yeah, huh. - Yeah. - But you know what I realized? I don't want my Food to turn me into a monster! You know what I mean? - Oh no! - If natural Food didn't have to be Labeled... It would be cheaper than Altered Food! That's why I come to places like this where we respect Food. It's holy, like a church Where they feed us for Money. Little bit. Christmas in Japan. - It looks like "Finding Nemo", yeah. - Finding Nemo, I found him. You found him. He's like just a little guy. - Let's see how he tastes. Let's see how he tastes. Oh yeah! Yep. This ain't vegan. Most of what people call calamari is actually made out of pig intestines! Ew! Well guys, that's all she wrote! Ate a bunch of good food, high-fived a couple fans. Now I think I'm gonna have a beer. Oh, check it out. Someone placed a sheep sticker here. Baa, sheep.

If we don't Alter Food, we can't feed the World. We were forced to conceive a powerful new process. - Supernatural Foods, you force us to ingest. It's infected everyone! Even the 1 % of the 1 % can't escape. - Uber-natural. - Surely, there must be some indigenous tribes who have no exposure to Altered Foods. - Yes, it's true. The indigenous may be the only ones left at the end of it all. - Altered Food makes Life more sustainable. - And prevents Death! - In an extreme case, I wouldn't be surprised if Supernatural foods could raise the Dead. You've opened Pandora's Box. - The Government is the people. The Government says it's safe. - Correction, the Government doesn't say it's not safe. - Precisely, the Good Cookbook allows it. - What book is that? - The Zombies have shifted the burden of Proof onto we humans. - To raise the Dead, wouldn't it take some kind of trigger? A touch, a smell, a taste or a certain sound? - The Government is implanted with Zombies like yourself. You're like a Robot. - Robot or Zombie? Which is it? - You're a Troll who just wants Views! You're like Zombie Robot Troll. - Like the Terminator? Get a Life. Life? I got more Views than you. I got more Views than anybody! - I'm a round up my posse! - Yo, oppan Gangsta style. - Who is it? - Open. Open up. What is this? - You know what it is. - I didn't authorize this. - You advanced your account. - Subject to my approval! - We used her Web services. You need some skin in the game. - Where is the master? I write the songs... I own the master! - I write the songs. - Who are you? - There's your master. You MH head. We are not Artistes. We are Entertainers! - What? - Ricco. Dominoes' gonna pay us big! Come on Ricco, we gotta go! - It's our big break! Get a grip! - Music goes deeper into our consciousness than mere poli-tricks! - Man, how many times do I have to sing this song... Until the day I Die? - You opener? - Shh. We go after you. - We open for you? - We are Idol! - Ricco, don't you get it? Pop makes a hybrid of all Mutations. - Pop is the popular, hyung. Not the Zombie. - Then we already Dead. - I heard about you, man... on the Web. - Shaiza. - Sheeppsyches, are you ready?

The CIA suspects a misanthropic hacker named Clone-Squared, the silent leader of an International group of cracker sleeper cells. He is believed to be the truth father of the Worldwide Web. Speculation is Clone-Squared lost all touch with humanity and is now committing Murder-suicide of his own Son. It was just a matter of time. On the streets, there's rioters, Mutants, looters, Zombies of all kinds. Rogue Robot Drones have started to appear in urban areas. It is unclear who is controlling them. Sources suspect it could be group Anonymous or even the more anarchical group, Eponymous. With the F5 Hurricane Lee expected to make landfall tomorrow morning, this couldn't be happening at a worse possible time. Oh my god. What is that? I can't breathe. I can't breathe! - Zombie. - What's my name? Zombie. Peace. - Peace, that's not my name. Peace! - It's Jo Bin. Jo Bin. - Who is this? Jo Bin. - I'm here. Where is he? - Everybody is... At the house.

The luxury of no hope had been given to me by my Xister, by my Blood. - What do you want from me? - In this Alternative Universe, there was no other choice because if a Zombie could control human brains then Redrum was the way to set them Free. Jo Bin! What do you want? You want Money? You want Blood? You want to Play? What do you want? Help! Help! - This ain't no dancehall, mon. No rocksteady, no bebop, no roots. No ska, ain't no dub, no mon. Ain't no raggedy streggae! This is Rastafari, King of kings, Lord of lords. Strong like lion, Mount Zion! Haile Selassie I!
