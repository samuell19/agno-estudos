Once upon a time, there was a girl called Aliaa. A man fell in love with her, and they got married. But as time went by, he caused her pain. He hurt her, broke her. May God never let a young woman, or an old woman, suffer the way she did. She was desperate for anyone to believe her, but no one did. She went looking for a solution, but no one would listen, not even her own family. She went looking for a solution, for someone who would listen. Then an ear in the middle of the desert heard her. An ear with strange features. An ear that understood her problem and knew how to solve it. That ear promised to give her a servant who would obey her. So it gave her Siba, who we used to hear about from our grandmothers long ago. Siba The Mysterious. She cleansed the sins of her man, and he came back a new person. From that day on, she was content and started thinking about others like her. The mysterious ring belonged to Siba. She went and punished all men for her and every other woman. - You blinked! - I didn't! A fly flew into my eye! - I saw you blink! - Reema, a fly flew into my eye! I saw you blink! You always beat me in this game. Hi, Tarek. - Hi. - I left you dinner on the stove. Sorry. We had dinner without you because you were late. - I'm not hungry. - Why does Daddy work so late every night? He has a lot of work, sweetie. More than you do? Not more than Mom. But I'm an IT technician. I'm the last person to leave. Mom, what's an IT technician? It's... like, when something goes wrong with the school's login system, you call the IT department. Who said the word "IT"? Me or Mom? It's okay. The girl was asking. And I'm trying to answer her. Mom knows everything. Sweetie, he knows everything too. Ask Dad. Good. Now put away your things. It's bedtime. Come in. Which floor? Second floor, please. The difference between a male and a man... Today, there are a lot of males. But are they all men? No. So, what do you mean when you say "a man"? Responsibility. - But women are responsible too. - No. - She goes back home, feeds the kids... - No. - On top of that, she has to work. - Different responsibilities, yes. - She has to do all this, if not more. - Yes. No. Hello? - Hey, Tarek. - Hi. Are you coming home soon? - I'm still at work. - Isn't it closing time? It is, but I still have some work to do. Will you be home for dinner? - I will. - Should I order dinner? I'll come home as soon as I'm done. Okay, bye. Is it his job to take care of the kids? Or stay at home? - Throughout history... He does... - He must help with the kids. Okay, Salma, but try to use a smaller font and fewer words. And whenever you're addressing one of our subsidiaries, never use the word "kindly." Your tone has to be direct. "You are required to." That's it. Good job. Excellent. I don't even smoke. I came because I heard a noise. It sounded like a seagull. Do you know what a seagull sounds like? How's work? Nasty. Watch out for Abu Mouath. Why? He's a sexual harasser. I know. That he's a harasser? Don't worry about me. Tarek, how's it going with Abu Mouath's request? I'm printing the invoices. I'll give them to Salma ASAP. Salma resigned today. INVITATION TO ABU MOUATH Do you feel lonely? That no one cares about you? That you still haven't found your partner? Well, I have the answer to your problem. I have what you need. A magical place, a scenic landscape, with a partner who can appreciate and transform you. Your marriage is finalized in 24 hours, with total privacy protection. Sign up now, and no one will know about it. You haven't booked a hotel yet? How many years have passed since we wanted to change? How many times have we said that we'd change? To sum it up, I think that it's all about making a decision. To every man listening right now, be bold. Get out there. If an idea scares you, just go for it. As a man, you need to seek adventure and take risks. You shouldn't stay at home until you're old and gray. Be at the heart of what you desire. Hello. I have a reservation under the name of Tarek... First of all, I'd like to inform you that an outfit will be delivered to your room before any activity starts. Second, once the activities are over, guests aren't allowed to leave the rooms. It's for your own safety. Third, if you need any assistance, just dial zero from the phone in your room, and we'll gladly help you. Who are those men? Guests. Like you. How do I get to my room? A bellboy will take you to your room now. Welcome, sir. - Thank you. - You're welcome. This is the outfit for our guests. For your privacy, you may cover your face with the headscarf if you like. Why would I? To protect your privacy. Good evening, dear guest. Please come with me. Where to? You'll find out soon. Come with me, please. Welcome. It's a pleasure to have you here. The pleasure is mine. How was your trip? A bit exhausting. How's the place? I hope you like it. I just got here. I haven't had the chance to look around. But I can already say that the place is impressive and authentic. Authentic. I love this word. Indeed. Everything about our traditions is authentic. And because you're authentic, we accepted your application. Hopefully, you'll be pleased. How's your family at home? They're fine, thanks. Why didn't you bring your kids? I'm just kidding. I could see that you're tense, so I thought I'd lighten up the mood. Very well. Obviously, you visited our website and checked out our services, and most importantly, you saw that we operate with complete secrecy. The marriage ceremonies that take place here are usually performed with a sense of community. So you'll be attending others' weddings, and others will be attending yours. Unless, of course, you have a problem with that. We can understand. No, I have no problem at all. Excellent. Go ahead, open it. Put it on. Fits you like a glove. Thank you for the gift. But if I could at least see the girl that I picked... Later. You will. Just get some rest now. Everything will come in time. Take him to his room so he can rest. You've had a long trip. WE'RE PLEASED TO INVITE YOU TO TONIGHT'S WEDDING BE READY AT 8:30 PM SO WE CAN ESCORT YOU Is this your first time here? Is this your first time here? Yes, it is. You're lucky. Is it your first time too? Yes, and it's going to be the best. - How do you know? - Just be patient. You'll see. - So, you know how things work around here? - No one knows for sure. That makes it an exciting experience. - How do you mean? - It's a different experience. You'll regret every day you spent before coming to this place. Don't you have an idea of a woman that you think is the most beautiful? I've never thought about it. Come on, man. It seems that you have something in mind, but you're trying to hide it. What does that have to do with anything? It has to do with getting to live the best days of your life here. What makes you so sure about that? Because my friends who came here, none of them ever came back. Did you see how happy the groom was, pulling the camel? - Hopefully, we'll get our turn soon. - Amen. It was a pleasure. Thank you for the lovely evening. It was a pleasure. You're now allowed out at this time. I heard something from afar. Everything's under control. Go back to your room now. Tell me, son. Have you seen Salma? Do you know where she is? Where have they taken her? - I'll ask someone about her. - Don't bother. I already did. I couldn't find her. She's been gone for two days. How do you know Salma? Salma is my daughter. I came here for her. But it's not like her to leave me for that long. Are you her father? Yes, I am. She told me someone had proposed to her. Someone from work. She wanted me to meet him. You see, we want her to get married. That's why I'm asking you, son. Try to find her. And if you do, bring her back to me. Give me this glass, sir. Try to rest. Where did you get this ring? They gave it to me when I arrived. Listen, son. I'll give you a location where I need you to go look for her. Please, son, promise me that you will. I promise. Listen, son. Don't let anyone see you leave. Do not trust anyone here. Just head to the main gate, and do not flinch. Just show your ring. Continue going straight until you reach the exit. You'll have a hotel to the south and the farmlands to the north. On the right, you'll have the desert. On the left, you'll have the exit. Continue going straight until you reach the farmlands. Once you get past the farmlands, son, you'll see a very long passage ahead. You'll see some mud houses on both sides. Once you get there, keep going until you see the first farm. On the left, you'll find a well. Once you reach the well, that's it. You're there. Behind the well, you'll find the wilderness. Go there. You'll see the house lights from there. Please, son, do what I asked. And bring Salma back to me. Who are you? Why are you here? Are you looking for Salma? Do you know her? I do, but I'm thirsty. I need some water first. Why didn't you get it yourself? You know everything. Everybody goes there nowadays. They say it's a land of riches and abundance. She's too far from home. Poor Aliaa. She was left all alone in that remote place. Everybody goes there nowadays. They say it's a land of riches and abundance. She's too far from home. Poor Aliaa.

This place is strange. Everything about it is. I don't know. Maybe I saw something that I wasn't supposed to see. What do you mean? I went out last night. I thought I heard something. I decided to go check it out. Maybe there was a fight or something. But the place was dead silent. There was nothing at all. Then I saw the matchmaker. You know her. She was with her assistant, that creepy one. They were standing outside one of the rooms, but I couldn't see what was inside. Then she gave me that look. You know that scary look? So I ran back to my room. And the nightmares... nightmares that kept getting stranger and stranger. I couldn't sleep. But it's almost over. My flight home is tomorrow. I'm leaving this place for good. What do you mean, man? We must leave today. We can't wait until tomorrow. I've seen strange things. I've had nightmares. I'm not sure if I'm really talking to you right now. I no longer know. What do you think? We should get out of whatever it is that we got ourselves into. Just go home. No! No! Did you forget that tonight's my wedding? That's right! Besides, what happens here, stays here. You'll never find Mona, and I'll never find Salma. Let's leave before it gets worse. What about Mona? Did you actually see Mona? Are you sure she even exists? Listen. This place is dangerous. There's plenty of fish in the sea. Okay. Fine. I'll meet you in the lobby in an hour. Wait. What's that on your finger? See? Strange things keep happening around here. I'll see you in the lobby. I know you can't handle this. I'm fine. Hey! It's great to see you, man! How are you? Hi. What's taking you so long? I've been waiting for you. Waiting? Where? We agreed to run away. You got me wrong, boy! I just wanted to scare the ones who run this place. And I did. I threatened them. I said, "Unless you give me what I came for, I'll leave." And they did! They brought Mona. That's right! She's with me now. Mona! Hang on a second. Wait. This is the wedding invitation. My wedding is tonight. Take it! Dear guest... where to? "Where to"? I'm getting out of this place. May I ask why? Do you mind? Is this a prison or a hotel? I'm getting out of here. As you wish. A car will be here in a minute. This place is strange. Everything about it is. And the nightmares... Please, son, do what I asked. Bring Salma back to me. What is it? Are you okay? I want to go home. I just want to go home. What did I tell you when you first arrived? Yet, you want to rush everything. Be patient. You'll get what you want soon. Damn you! Are you stupid? Why are you here? Answer me! I came for you. Damn the moment I ever saw you. Show some respect. You ruined everything for us. You ruined my life. I ruined your life? What life? Did you even have one? Why have you been so different lately? Your silence is suspicious. I feel pain. Pain that I've never felt before. I don't know what it is. What I do know is that I'm not happy. You know, a long time ago, longer than I can even remember, I was your age. The only thing I ever did was pretend to be someone I wasn't. Can you imagine that? Every day it's you, but it's not? And for what? To please everyone else. I used to watch myself fading away day after day. So don't talk to me about pain. What's the purpose? None of us women chose to be in this position. I know that you suffered. But we can choose happiness. Happiness? What is happiness? Happiness is a fairy tale. Don't fall for it. I believe in your concept. But I feel that this place has become devoid of mercy. Look at your arms. Is that the mercy you're talking about? Do you see any mercy there? Where was mercy when they did what they did to us? So, what's the plan now? Will they stay here as slaves? What about the wife who's waiting for her husband's return? The husband who'd make the same mistake if he returned? We don't know that. We could change them... It would be useless. I really feel sorry for you. There's an ear in the middle of the desert that offered me a different solution. I hope you'll understand why I did what I did. And I hope you won't be mad at me. Your wise teachings are still there, and your lessons are still being learned, but with a different approach. An approach I had to adopt so I could see your dream become a reality. Don't hate me. I'm still the same girl who came to you completely lost. The girl who became strong because of you and only you. I know that you'll thank me in time. - You blinked! - I didn't! Reema, I saw you with my own eyes! You blinked before I did! You lost! No! Last time, I lost. This time, I didn't... I want to play with you. Subtitle translation by: Nourhan ElMor.
