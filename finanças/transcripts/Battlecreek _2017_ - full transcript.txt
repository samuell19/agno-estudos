Subtitles by explosiveskull Every Tuesday you light up like a goddamn Christmas tree. Hey, I'm talking to you. You look at me. He screwed you, too? Screwed you, too, like the other ones? Huh? He screwed you, too? Hey, I'm talking to you. Come here. I'm talking to you. Hey! Come on. Come one, boy. Here we go, baby. Who's a good dog? Good dog. Have I told you you have what we call fire-shaped hands? Full of passion and pent up energy. Always looking for somewhere to put all that... I didn't come here to get my palm read. Hey, Henry. Thought that boy of yours was a vampire. Only coming out at night. Carl, we wouldn't want you to be late, now would we? Carl was just stopping by. I got you these. My talented baby should have new brushes to paint the world with. Thanks. So, how was work? It was fine. Mrs. Martin's on her way over. I'm taking her under tonight. I thought you weren't gonna do that again with her. She wasn't ready before. What does she think she's ready now? Because contrary to what you might think, Henry Pearl, there are certain things I do in fact know. And I know what people need. If you say so. I'll put a new shirt on your bed, baby. How you doing, darling? All right. You? Well, I'm fed up, Henry. Since the bottling plant laid him off Arnie's done nothing except wear a groove in my sofa. And, he made me throw away every bottle in the house. I may just move in with my mother. You may wanna rethink that. How's the old bird? Still colorful as ever? Maybe I should come by and see her. See what's on the horizon. God help me. Aw! My mother used to read me poetry every night, before bed. I always liked them. Not too many words to get caught up on. I guess. Sometimes. Arnie says I have the attention span of a flea. Like he can talk! I don't think that man can even read, aside from the TV guide. Quit your yapping, Melinda, and move that ass. Sorry, kid, I broke a yolk. Two eggs, sunny side up, sorta, and a side of cakes. Dig in, Henry. Sorry. I guess Arnie ain't that bad a guy, after all. See you reading that fiction again, Henry. I was told, "You want it, you got to seek the truth." Plato says, "Poetry is near to truth than history." Now, Frost, he likens it to taking life by the throat. I like that. Taking life by the throat. - That's good. - I keep telling you. Poems have their own language. Whole different rhythm, different than anything else. Kinda like you jazz. Nah, it ain't nothing like my jazz. People just get scared of all of it. It's just a matter of listening, taking in what's there. You know what I believe? I believe... read too much... and you drank too little. You've to throw that in. Huh? Huh? All right, then. I ain't bad. What am I gonna do with this now? Let's see. Oh! - Shit's getting old. - You all right? I'm all right, I'm all right. I'm good, I'm good. - I'll get it. - Yeah, okay, go. Go and get that. How you doing, Henry? Would you mind putting that out. What can I do for you? - You got no gas? - No, it's out of order. Why don't you gimme two of them gallons of oil. 15w40. Yeah, I got it. How you doing there, Magnus? Doing all right. Yourself? Doing all right. Thank you. Man, you two must be bored to shit here, night after night, no TV, no women. I'd blow my goddamn brains out. Wouldn't that be a blessing from above. What the fuck did you just say? I'm gonna put these in the back for you. That'll be 20 dollars. Why don't I just owe ya? You two faggots have fun. I ought to wring that boy's neck. What do your fancy Frost think about that there? That doesn't look too good. It's just overheated. I don't know. Where's your water hose. - It's right here, I can get it. - I got it. You have far to go? You shouldn't be driving too long when it's like this. What do I owe you? It's just water. Drive safe. Oh, shit. See that right there, over there? That's the problem right there. I'm gonna have to fix this leak. I'm gonna have to get some parts. Once I fix it, you'll be all right. But you know what? You're lucky you got this thing over here. It's in pretty bad shape. Can you fix it? Well, it's gonna take a while, but you can leave it with me. How long? I'm gonna have to get a... It's just... I'm kinda eager to get going. It ain't gonna take too much time. I don't have any money to pay you. And I don't expect any free rides right now but this is kinda my home. Well, I'll... I'll tell you what. The local diner is looking for somebody. I want you to go down there, and you ask for Melinda. You got that? Melinda, You tell her Arthur sent you. That's me. Uh, meantime, take this mount back, when you're ready, we gonna get this up and running for you. All right? Okay. Well, food ain't gonna cook itself. Might taste better if it did. - Y'all don't have a address or a phone? - Nope. Look, anything you need doing, I can do. I've bust a fair amount of dishes in my life. I can clean and if you need any cooking done, I can do that, too. We sure the hell do. We've been having some trouble with one of our waitresses showing up, so, it maybe the night shift. That's fine. I just need the work. Well then, I guess we'll see you tonight. Great. Love is definitely in your cards. Just... don't give your power away to the first man who offers to buy you dinner. Without our power, we're as good as dead. Dinner? I'm lucky if I get peanuts from a bear. Oh, come by, we'll take another look. Oh, wait, Miss Pearl, you forgot something. Well, life wouldn't be too interesting without this, now would it? And, it's Tallulah, sweet thing. Tallulah. Haven't seen her around here before. - No, she is definitely a new face. - Mm-hmm. I could set a watch by you, Henry Pearl. Henry's here. Gina didn't show up last night. Third shift this week. Jack just got fed up. She just walked in here like we ordered her. Melinda, come on, order's up. Sweet Jesus, Jack! You all right, sweetheart? You seem a little jumpy. Hey. Hey. Arthur said the parts should be in soon, to fix your car. Good to know. - If you want me to take a look at it in the meantime... - No, it's okay. I appreciate the offer but it's fine. Let me help you with that, Cutie. That's Henry. He's a sweetheart. Same time, same seat, same everything. He's got some type of skin disease where he can't go in the sunlight. Poor thing. He ain't been out in the sun since he was a little boy. All right, it says here that Jelly Roll Morton got his start playing piano in a brothel. Fourteen years old. Yeah. And then we all sang every last word of it. Ain't nothing in those books you can teach me. Henry, ain't I be doing your head all these years the things you got to know. - Yes, you have. - Yes, I have. But, I mean, you wouldn't know a drive socket from a flare nut, now would you? I believe old Jelly Roll had him some sweet times. There's some sweet inspiration between those walls. Their men need a little sweet inspiration, you know what I mean? Are you suggesting I go to a brothel, Arthur? No, I ain't saying nothing. I ain't saying all that. But I'll tell you what, it sure beats the hell out of you spending all your nights hanging around here with me. Yeah, what about you? Oh, come on, now. When Martha passed, I went into retirement, man. I thought I'll... just close up shop for a while. But you... you got no excuse. I could think of a few. Yeah? Like what? Let me tell you something. That music that you're reading about, was created by people who came to this country in chains. And that same music can set a man's soul free. Every man has got to learn to break free of whatever shackles are binding him, Henry. It don't matter if you scared to death to do what you got to do it. That's the truth. That's the sure enough truth. Drink up, man. Damn. Henry... why don't you come around here and paint these walls. All that stuff you got in your head, man. Just give the place a little life, you know? What are you thinking? Some tropical... tropical island with a... with some palm trees, and a real nice beach and me... laying out on that beach, being served an ice cold beer... by a real pretty lady. Well, I thought you said you were retired. I said for a while. I ain't said my whole life. - Oh, for a while? - For a while. All right, I'll see what I can do. You all right with me, Henry. You all right with me. Morning, Janice. Afternoon, Henry. Does Ms. Nelson still have that room to rent? Why? You going somewhere? - It's for a friend. - A friend? What friend? Never mind. Uh, Henry, as far as I know, it's still for rent. Thanks. That boy of yours is so sweet. Always thinking of others. He sure is. He's as sweet as pie. I'm sure your car will be fine for the Fall, but come Winter, and you'll freeze to death. I don't plan on being here that long. Maybe not... Oh, and Ms. Nelson doesn't hear that well, so you'll have to speak up. Thanks. So you're a friend of Henry's? Um, not really. That's nice, dear. It's just up these stairs. Now, there's no smoking in the house and I don't want any loud commotion. I go to bed early, and I'm up with the sun. There won't be any noise. No boys. I won't have any funny business, do you hear me? I run a clean house. I understand. It's right through here. You're a pretty little thing. This is it. So, um, do you have family back in Florida? Who said I was from Florida? Your license plate on your car. It's Alison, right? I'm Henry. Listen, I appreciate you finding me a room but I'm really not looking for friends right now. It's nothing personal. Nothing personal. I told you I'd use a horn. You don't say. Mm-hmm. My granddaddy and me used to sit on the back porch listening to Dizzy Gillespie like it was our last dying wish. Old guy used to make me use scales, you know, till my lungs burned out, my lips burnt up. He didn't know the meaning of the word "suffering." He used to say to me, "Boy, you damn well better walk through life "dealing with what God serves up with a smile on your face, "and dignity in your step." That's what I did. Sure. I thought I was gonna teach Miles Davis a thing or two. Yeah, I did. Life happened. Yeah, you damn straight. Lots of things happened, and my daddy told me, he said, "Boy, don't you know a Black man don't have the luxury of dreaming?" Henry, how long you gonna hang around here playing with engine bars? - Huh? - I don't know. I don't know. I never really thought about it. Well... you better start thinking about it. Right now. You living like a young man that ain't got no choices. They're kinda limited. Says who? I don't see nobody holding you back. Henry... you got your whole life ahead of you. All you got to do is, you step out there and you take what's yours, you hear me? It's like your man said, you got to grab life by the throat. Hey. What are you doing here? Hey. It's not really safe at this time of night for you to be down here. You're here. People tend to leave me alone. Listen, at the diner, when I said I didn't need any friends, I didn't mean to, um... I'm not used to... It's fine. Why are you being so nice to me? Don't you sleep? Don't you? It is too hot to sleep. Mrs. Nelson doesn't like fans cause she says they're too noisy. Uh, come on, I'll walk you. Come on. That's Mr. Hayworth. He lost his wife eight years ago. Every night, he sits on that porch till he falls asleep. Like he's waiting for something. Hi, hi, hi... This is Benny. - Hi. - You want a treat, buddy? There you go. I always bring him treats. He knows all the town secrets. He's beautiful. Well, this is me. Can I walk you home? No, I'm fine. It's close enough. Guess I'll see you around, then. I guess you will. You like fairs? Every year the whole town puts on a fair behind the old cider mill. It ain't much. Trust me. But Melinda will be defending her apple bobbing title. Four years running. She trains and everything. Jack shuts down the diner for the night, too, so everyone can go. Yeah. Maybe. Did you have a good night? The usual. Come sit with your mama. "The fool"... representing the beginning of a new life cycle. And the "High Priestess"... she speaks of hidden influences. Usually that of a woman. Stop taking, Tallulah. I'm just telling you what I see, baby. Nothing more. It's never "nothing" with you. Tell your mommy you love her. Oh, you know I do. Say it. It's late, Tallulah. Good night. I'll make sure to stay on your good side. My brother taught me how to shoot. Take your pick. The bear. So, um, where does your brother live? Oh, really? I hear that's nice this time of year. Do you want anything? - Uh, no. - You sure? Yeah. - You want to try this? - Five bucks to see the freaks. We got two headed cat, three legged dog, and some really ugly women. Hey, Henry, why don't you come on here. You'll feel right at home. He might just be the most normal fucker in there. That'd be a first. Did I tell you I was nailing his mama? Yeah, man. Must be one tired piece of ass. Come on, Henry, you'd make more money than at the gas station. What do you say, Henry? A little money in your pocket, you can move out of your mama's house. Hey, he's ignoring you, man. That freak ain't listening to you, man. Hold my beer. Hey, I'm talking to you. Think you can ignore me? You turned your back on me, freak? What the hell is wrong with you? Oh! Dracula got himself a little bodyguard. Let's go. That's right. Move along. You shouldn't let him get away with that. I'm used to fighting my own battles. They're assholes. You shouldn't let them... Like I said, I can fight my own battles. I don't need your help. I don't call that fighting. These damn drinks are gonna drive your mama crazy. I feel like I have the whole town's worries inside my head. I heard you and that girl were at the fair. Your spies working overtime, Tallulah? I'm just looking out for you, Henry. Are you gonna tell me who she is? No one you know. Oh, I know everyone in this town. Henry, what happened to your face? It was nothing. It doesn't look like nothing. Look at you. I said I'm fine. - Henry, who did this? - It doesn't matter. I will be goddamned if I let anyone lay a hand on my baby. I will find out who did this. I am this town's eyes and ears, Henry. So the hell what, Tallulah? That's never stopped anyone before, now has it? Gentlemen. Well, I'll be damned. The man finally did something right. I heard that. Arnie found a job, too. Looks like our luck maybe changing, kiddo. Coffee. How's everyone doing tonight? Can I help you, Henry? Like I told you, I don't need any help. I could use some more coffee. Fine. You know where it is. Stupid boys. What would you like? Do you ever miss it? Sunlight. I don't know. I got used to the night, I guess. Quiet, the rhythm of it. Sometimes it feels like it's only mine. I guess I could sit near my window, or go outside if I stayed undercover. But, I always just felt like hiding. And this isn't? I don't know. I guess we're all hiding from something. People used to call me a vampire. Said I slept in a coffin. I'm sure some still do. People are cruel. Well, just scared I think. My mom thought home schooling would be easier on me. The Korean war is a bit shady, but the underlying meaning of amphibians in dreams, I could write you a dissertation. Trust me, you didn't miss much. Pop quizzes, school dances, Halloween. You missed Halloween? All these years, I've had such a good costume. Come on. What? Come on. Good God. What on Earth? I'm sorry to wake you, Mrs. Koehler. Henry, are you all right? You nearly gave me a heart attack, sugar. What are you doing dressed like that? And at this hour. We're Trick-or-treating. Halloween's not for another month. He's making up for lost time. Well, I'm not sure what we got in the way of candy. Hold on. You're supposed to say "Trick-or-treat" when they open the door. That's just stupid. Will pop tarts do? You can have them for breakfast. - Perfect. Thank you. - Thank you. - All right. - Sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Koehler. Oh, any time, sugar. - Good night. - Good night. This is all I got. Ooh. Go on, take that. - Get out of here. - Thank you, Arthur. - You'll have a great time. - Good night. All right, then. Mm. I think I ate too much. Janice's plan isn't settling very well. Where's that? I don't know. Somewhere. Anywhere. How did this happen? I don't remember much. I was pretty young when it happened. I must have been out there for a while. I can remember the burning. The actual feel of my skin melting under the heat. The smell of it... It's a smell you never forget. Where were your parents? I don't know. Tallulah had left me with my dad. He was drunk most of the time. I guess he didn't hear me until it was too late. He took off, not too long after. I'm sorry, Henry. The weirdest thing is for a few moments, it actually felt good. The way the heat felt on my skin. The kind that reaches deep inside you and warms you from the inside out. It felt good. Like I was alive. So? You're sticking around for a while? Considering you're fucking my son under my roof, I think it's about time we were properly introduced, don't you? I'm Tallulah. And you are? Alison. Come sit down, Alison. Alison... I am a dreamer. I'm sure Henry's told you something about that. And sometimes, these dreams are pretty damn vivid. Sometimes, I see colors, animals, visions. And then, other times... it's just an overwhelming feeling that something just ain't right. You know what I mean when "something just ain't right"? Looks like someone could use a little soul soother... as my daddy used to call it. May I see your palm? Come on. You have what we call an "earth hand." Practical, hardworking. You have no illusions about how this world works. You have long a pile of anger. Some might say that's a sure sign of someone who just can't get enough of a good thing. Do you know what I mean? I should get going. Wait a minute. This, here, is your life line. Looks like you've had a hell of a time, honey. Something sure left its mark. Or should I say someone? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. It's just what you see. It's nice to meet you, Tallulah. Henry's here. Fire up the usual. Actually, I think I feel like something different today. Are you feeling okay, Henry Pearl? Sure. Fine. I want a waffle, please. My mama always said that silence was the loudest thing there is. And you two are quiet as a couple of church mice. I ain't no Monet... but it sure does look better than his serial killer scroll. Monet, my ass, Melinda. Come get this food. Ah! The voice of an angel. Are you okay? Fine. You met Tallulah. Yeah. What'd she have to say? Nothing, really. Just saying hi. Alison, come over here. All right, turn that, right there. - This one? - Mm-hmm. Turn that real good. Tighten it up real good. Well, you strong, girl. - Yeah. - There you go. Thats gonna be done. - That's it? - That's it. Henry... this little lady is a better mechanic than you are, man. She can have my job. She's stronger and she's faster, too. There you go. Take that. There you go. Go on, have a seat right there. You're doing all the work. That's all right. Hold that. There's some coffee for you. - Thank you. - All right. You know what? I'm gonna check this tire for you. You know what I don't understand? Young girl like you traveling these roads by herself. I'm just traveling. Anybody missing you at home? They have their lives, and I have mine. Yeah. Hey, where your keys at? I'm gonna fire this up for you. - They're in there. - Okay. That's beautiful, Henry. My mother used to take us to the ocean... In the summers when it gets so hot that you couldn't breathe, she'd pack up my brother and I in the middle of the night, and drive for hours while we slept. She's never stop for anything. She'd just drive like she was on a mission or something. And she used to say there's only one thing better than waking up to the sound of the ocean, and that's the sun on your face. I'm sorry. Yeah, but it's nice. Close your eyes. It's not the same but... I'd like to see it one day. Get in! Come on, get in. You're chicken? Miss Tallulah! To what do we owe this pleasure? I just thought I'd stop by. See where my Henry spends most of his time. Well, what can I get for ya? A cup of coffee. And how about a piece of that delicious looking pie? Well, that's your safest bet. I baked that myself. I keep telling Henry I need to stop by and pay you a visit. You bet you do. Well, not sure I can handle what's in store. You don't got to worry about that. Life gives us what we need, Melinda. So, what do you know about this new girl? - Alison, is it? - Alison. She's a sweet girl. She just kinda showed up, really. We were in a pickle, cause Gina's not been showing up for her shifts. I don't like to gossip, but her husband ain't a nice man. She say where she was from? No, no, just keeps to herself, mostly. Well, that and Henry. Those two just seem to get on like a house on fire. She just called in a minute ago, and said they were staring at the gosh-darn-ocean right this very minute. I think it's great he's getting out there. Next thing, they'll be moving right on out of this town. I'm just gonna take this with me if you don't mind. Oh, sure, sure. Just gimme a minute. I'll wrap it up for you. I keep on telling Jack I ought to get a commission for every piece of pie I sell. What's going on? In almost 24 hours... He doesn't have the courtesy to call his own mother. He's fine, Tallulah. He's probably hiding under a tree or in a cave somewhere. That's my goddamn son you're talking about, Carl. You hear me? My son! Jesus Christ! He's a grown man. He's probably with that piece of his. I figured you'd be happy he was getting laid... looking the way he does. You just get the fuck out. You hear me? Just get the fuck out, and don't you ever come back. You know what? You two belong together. You fucking freaks. Let's not go back. Come on, let's keep on driving. Find some town by the sea, get a little place. I can get a job working on cars. Well, actually, maybe you should do that. You're a better mechanic than I am. I could read you poetry. Oh, great. I'll work while you read. I'll paint the house. This is nice. Right here, right now. It's been a long time since I could say that. Well, let's just be here. It's because of me. No, it's got nothing to do with that. Not everything in this world is good, Henry. Not like you. Some of us can hide the reminders of what we carry, and some of us can't. Well, I'll be god damned. He lives. You wanna tell me where you've been for the last two days? Without a fucking word. I'm tired, Tallulah. Don't gimme that "I'm tired, Tallulah" bullshit. And what is this? Have you forgotten your condition? I haven't forgotten anything. Oh, come on, Tallulah. You're all knowing. Can't you see I was just fine? Don't you back talk me, Henry Pearl. All I've done is give you everything. Every last inch of my days and nights, worrying and protecting you from the evils of this world, and I will be god damned if I let you disrespect me. And what if I don't think this world is so evil? Then I'd say you were a fool. Who the hell is she, Henry? People don't just appear out of nowhere for no reason. There's a darkness in her past, and I do not... Stop it. I don't give a shit about what you think you see. Now she's here. It doesn't matter where she's been. Not to me. Evening, boys. Go take care of them, sweetheart. Yeah, come take care of us, will you, sweetheart? Thank you. What'll it be? What are your specials? I can't read that far, You mind reading it for me, sweetheart? Chili, steak. Well, those both do sound delicious. I don't know, Magnus, what do you think? Well, I could do the chili, but then again, can't beat a good, thick piece of meat. Two steaks, rare. And make sure he doesn't overcook them, sweetheart. Oh, and coffee. Wait, man, I'm getting something, like one of them psychic visions. Yeah, yeah, it's getting clearer. It's Tallulah Pearl. And she's on her knees. Like the village dog. Hey, do you think Henry here squeals like his mama does? Actually, they say a woman's vocality during sex often suggests an overcompensation for a partner's lack of performance. What the hell did he just say? He said you're shit in bed. Oh, shoot. So sorry, the lid must be loose. You're going to regret that. I don't think I will. Settle down, Carl. You don't want Jack to get all riled up, now do you? Lord knows he's twice your size. Let's get out of this shithole. I don't know, Henry, I reckon your little lady here has some fire in her belly. It was an accident. - More? - Yes, please. What? Nothing. Just looking. You seem different. How so? I don't know. The diner, with those guys. Yeah, I guess it wouldn't hurt to point out what morons they are. Then again, I have you now. I suppose you do. I think I'm gonna stay at my house tonight. We don't wanna wear out our welcome with Tallulah. She's all right. I'll see you tomorrow, okay. - I'll walk you home. - No. It's okay. It's just a few blocks. I know. But it's late. Henry, I'm a big girl. Yeah. Too much fire in her belly. - I'm waiting on you. - No. I'm waiting on you. We're waiting on you, ain't we, Henry? We're waiting on you. Come on. I got two left feet. Sir Henry, please? I knew you had it in you. I knew... I knew you had it in you. Nice. Look at that. Y'all wonderful. I like that. Let me get this one. You doing good, man. I think I drank too much. Are you all right? I just need a bathroom. Tell him we ain't got no gas over here. How you doing? We don't have any gas. I can see that. I was actually looking for a cold beer. So... Where the hell am I? Battlecreek. Battlecreek. Where you heading? Not sure yet. Passing through. Taking a look around. There's not much to see around here, I'm afraid. I don't know. There's always something to see. You know, I was actually looking for a friend of mine. Said she might come up this way. Seen new faces in town? None worth remembering. Well, I bet you're a hard one to forget. - You mind if I use your piss... - Sorry. It's out of order. But there's a good bar on your way out of town, if you're just passing through. Just a few miles down the street. Can't miss it. All right. Thanks. Is everything all right? I don't know. Alison? Where'd she go? She ain't back there? She ain't back there. Hey, Henry... Alison, what's going on? What the hell is this? Stay out of it, Henry. You brought that here? Into our house? This is who I am, Henry. You know, I can pretend all I want it's in the past, but it's never left me. It's always right here. You should know that better than anyone. No, this isn't who you are. Henry, I used to be in this so deep, I never thought I was gonna make it out alive. I just wanted a way out. Please, don't hate me for that. I'm sorry. I never wanted to involve you in this. Alison, wait. Just tell me who he is. It doesn't matter. Packing your car in the middle of the night and that doesn't fucking matter? Just tell me what's going on. I can't, Henry. It's got nothing to do with you. So, that's it? You're just gonna keep running? Not all of us can just float in one place forever. Some of us run. We have to. Alison, please don't. Evening, Tallulah. The usual? Why change a good thing? - Hey. - Hey. - Here you go. - Thank you. Now that's quite a name. Tallulah. Well, I am quite a woman. Who gave a little lady like you such a big name? My dear, sweet mama. She was from Huntsville, Alabama. The birth place of the one and only, Miss Tallulah Bankhead. Never mind. So what brings you to our sleepy little town? Just looking. Are you looking for someone? Or you just looking for some trouble? Maybe a little bit of both. I mean, a man can't help but have a little fun, now can he? I can tell, you like your fun. Isn't that right, Tallulah? A little fun never hurt nobody. Ain't that right? Ain't that the truth? So... who can little old Tallulah help you find? Once you're done having your fun, that is. Let's just say a lady friend of mine took off with something that doesn't belong to her. A whole lot of something. Well, it looks like your lucky day. 'Cause Tallulah just loves to give people what they want. Know what I mean? Think so. So what's your name? Cy. I bet you do. What's going on? You... You find Alison? Why does everyone lie, Arthur? Why? Well, I reckon... I can't really say, Henry. Not for sure. People mean well. I guess they just trying to protect the folk they love. I don't want protection. I never did. I want people to stop treating me like something that's always on the verge of breaking. You said if I want the truth, I have to seek the truth, right? Yeah. Well, I want the truth, Arthur. I want all of it. Okay. Have a seat. I got something I want to show you. I'll be right back. Your daddy left those behind, years ago. I didn't have the heart to get rid of them. But to be honest, I didn't know if you'd ever really want to see him or not. I just wanted to leave well enough alone, you know? You've been through your fair share. I didn't wanna cause any more trouble. It's okay. Were you good friends? Your daddy was a hard man to know, Henry. Quiet, kept to himself, did his work. Like you in that way. Your daddy was weak, Henry, in ways that you ain't. He never had the mental strength up here. Not like you. There were lot of things that were just too much for him. Your mama being one. That dame, she's a whole lot to handle. I guess people don't do too much changing, now do they? Why did he leave? Well, that's something between you and your mama. No, Arthur, please. Well, I guess he caught her messing around one time too many... and one day, he just up and left. Just like that. Now, it wasn't right... him walking out on his family. Walking out on you. But sometimes, when you're in a mess, pride, it just makes you do... stupid things. Things that he's gonna spend the rest of his life regretting. As far as Tallulah, we couldn't help but feel sorry for her. Next thing I know, you were gone and had your accident, and she's out here all alone trying to raise you. No, but he... He left me before the accident? Henry... I ain't one to get between you and your mama, you know that. You've been seeking the truth and I think it's about damn time you heard the truth. And I mean all of it. Henry, you... you got to talk to your mama. You understand me? You got to talk to your mama. Hey, you got to go. Just take it easy. Come on, you got to go. You got another visitor coming? My son's due home. So, what's the problem? Sonny boy still think mama's a virgin? I said you got to go. And I said... "Take it easy." Hey. Hey! What the hell are you doing? There's a diner in town. Serves some pretty good pie. I think you'll find what you're looking for. Hey darling, what are you doing here? Have you seen Henry? Well, no, he hasn't been in tonight. Where you going? Is everything all right? Well, I've been looking for you. We never really talk, you and I. Have you noticed that? I mean, you do a lot of talking, Tallulah. To everyone in this town, about everything. But me and you, we never really talk, do we? What do you wanna talk about? I wanna talk about how I ended up like this. - Sweetheart, I really... - I do. Tell me about the dreams, Tallulah. Your dreams, my dreams, the dreams that have kept us awake at night, and you drinking for the last 20 years. Let's talk about that. Why you doing this, Henry? Is it because of that girl? My father wasn't even here, was he? He couldn't handle what you had. He never could. No... The truth is, he couldn't handle you, Tallulah, could he? Henry, I don't know who you been talking to, but this has got to stop. You don't dream about bats or butterflies or black goddamn clouds, do you, Tallulah? You dream about what you did. You dream about this, don't you? I didn't leave. Don't you see that? And, I damn well could have. But, I was right here. I was right here. Always here. Your daddy knew who I was when he met me. But he wanted to squeeze the goddamn life out of me and keep me trapped here like some damn animal. He chose to leave. He chose to run away. From us, from you. I need to hear you say it, Tallulah. I need to hear you say it. Just say it, goddamn it! It was you. You were alone. You were drunk, and you left me out there. It was an accident. I swear. You wandered out there. And then... you started screaming. And you wouldn't stop screaming. And you needed your mama. And my baby's skin... My sweet baby's skin... Henry, I tried, but I just couldn't. No. No. You didn't, Tallulah. You just didn't. So you think you can just run off with what belongs to me? You little junkie whore. Are you gonna be a good girl? Not that anyone can hear you, any way. So, who you fucking these days for your fix? Are you just dipping into a box of meat? You got what you came for. You can leave me. Let me go. No. See, I've been thinking about our little reunion ever since you left. Every minute, every single thing that I'd do to you. You remember this, right? See, I'm gonna make this hurt. It's gonna hurt so bad... until you last... final... gasping breath. You don't have to do this. No, but I wanna. See, I want it so much that it makes me hard. I'm gonna make you beg. Beg for your life until I take it... That's what I love about you. You never did know when to stop fighting. The wild, dirty little animal that you are. And you know what happens to wild animals? You cut them until they're bleeding... Until they're begging and begging for their fucking life. Where's my baby going? You can't leave me. But I am. I'm not your baby. Henry... I know I lied to you. But I'll spend the rest of my days making it up to you. This isn't about you, Tallulah. I should have left a long time ago, and you should have pushed me to. But you didn't. You wanted me to stay and rot here. I'm awake. Don't you get it? Say goodbye, Tallulah. Henry? You! You did this! I'm so sorry, Henry. I'm so sorry. I don't wanna hide anymore. I know. I know. You don't have to. Everything is gonna be okay. "I have been one acquainted with the night. "I have walked out in rain And back in rain "I have outwalked The furthest city light "I have looked down The saddest city lane "I have passed By the watchman on his beat "And dropped my eyes Unwilling to explain "I have stood still And stopped the sound of feet "When far away An interrupted cry "Came over houses From another street "But not to call me back Or say good-bye "And further still At an unearthly height "One luminary clock Against the sky "Proclaimed the time Was neither wrong nor right "I have been one Acquainted with the night."
