Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to land at Bras?lia Airport. Please, put your seats in the upright position... fasten your seatbelts and fold back your tables. Thank you. Mr. Olavo Bilac, please, contact the crew... as soon as we land. Thank you. - Dr. Olavo Bilac? - Yes. Please, leave by the rear door. A car will be waiting for you... It's all right, sir. It's okay, I'm here. Don't be afraid. What do you mean, Laura? I'm not afraid. I've never been. It's okay, I'm here. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, we were unable to land... because of a tail wind. We apologize for the inconvenience. Very scary! Dr. Olavo, how nice to meet you! Raimundo de Oliveira, Congressional Adviser. Also Communications Adviser to Sigma Publicity. A company accused of the homicide. How nice they found that poor girl's body! Is the report ready? You've turned international! It's your chance to serve your country! What do you mean? THE SECRETS BEHIND THE SCANDAL By confirming it's her body. I'm not involved in politics. I heard your wife passed away. - I'm afraid so. - And... did you autopsy your wife yourself? At last! Hi. So nice to see you! In those glasses, you look just like Daddy! You got me into this, didn't you? Kind of. You should know your sister well enough! Let's go home now, you need a rest. This flight from LA is too long! 16 hours! The worst part was the stop in S?o Paulo. - This is for you. - For me? How lovely! - Thank you. - Martins, I found this second-hand. This book is fantastic! I lent one which has never returned. I wouldn't return it myself! Olavinho, I love it! It's beautiful! I'll put it by the armchair you sent. It'll look lovely on the verandah. You'll see. Maria, I won't be staying with you. It will remind me of Laura. We spent so much time together there. Sorry. - Okay? - Okay, okay... ...but first we'll have dinner, right? - I'm not hungry yet. I still... Martins, can we go to the morgue? Maybe we can solve everything at one go. All right. Tobias, we're on our way. Be ready. All right, I'll wait. They're already here. Tobias is on the case. He exhumed the body. When did she die? It coincides with when she disappeared. That's Brasilia for you! Most murders happen during the rains... when the grass grows. Bodies are thrown in the brush. It dries up in August, vegetation lowers... and the bodies start turning up. CORONER'S OFFICE Here, just one question! Here, just one question! Just one question! Let's do it. Let's tape it. According to forensic experts... Dr. Bilac will start work tonight... after his arduous journey from LA. UNKNOWN WOMAN The samples from her mother don't match up. - Where did you start? - We collected all we could. The material is in the lab for your analysis. I think it's enough. Almost. Right, doctor? Let's go! Olavo, make yourself at home. How long do you think you'll need? I don't know. - Probably not much. - All right, then. I'll go get Maria for dinner. Tobias? - See what he needs. Bye. - Bye. Anything you need, doctor? No, no. FORENSIC EXAM "Based on the reports attached to this examination... and on the witnesses testimonies, I attest that the accused... Mr. Augusto dos Anjos, single, filmmaker... born in S?o Paulo, on March 31, 1974... kidnapped and brutally murdered... his colleague Eug?nia C?mara. The motive would appear to have been jealousy... by the accused towards the victim... brought about by disorderly conduct of a provocative nature... confirmed by witness statements herein included." AUGUSTO DOS ANJOS ARRESTED TODAY AT HIS HOUSE WHERE IS EUG?NIA? Martins? Martins, is that you? Laura? Olavinho? Olavinho! Wake up, Olavinho! Wake up! You'd better sleep at home. No, no. No way. First, we're going to eat. We were invited to dinner. There's a shower over there, remember? Lt'll wake you up. And wear a tie. The dinner is in honor of senator Romero. I really don't get it. How does he work with all this mess? Everything's on and papers everywhere. I don't get it. He must be really good. Everyone is waiting here at the Coroner's Office... for Dr. Bilac to appear. Maybe he's identified Eug?nia's body. Please, Dr. Bilac! Do you have any information? Please, Dr. Bilac! Any information? The report will be out tomorrow at noon! Please! According to Dr. Martins Fontes... the report will be out tomorrow at noon... when Augusto dos Anjos's fate will be sealed... the man accused of having murdered Eug?nia C?mara. - Cacilda Becker, for TV Candango. - Thank you, Cacilda. Well, today we have with us Mr. Rui Barbosa... Augusto dos Anjos's defense attorney. Dr. Rui Barbosa, thank you for coming. Do you intend to take out a habeas corpus... ...for your client? - Oh yes, absolutely. Because I'm sure the examination will confirm... that the body found is not Eug?nia C?mara... therefore my client cannot be accused of homicide. He should be freed immediately... and face to all accusations in freedom. I'm sure of that. Look. That man with Martins is our Olavo... the most important man in Bras?lia today. Excuse me. Dr. Olavo! I'm glad you could make it. How are you, Martins? Maria, lovely as usual. We're so happy to have you here tonight. Are you fitting in in Brasilia? It feels like LA in a way, right? Hot by day, cold at night, desert weather. Dr. Gon?alves Dias is anxious to meet you. - Good evening. - This way, please. Mr. Gon?alves Dias is the CEO of Sigma Publicity. - Our host, Dr. Gon?alves Dias. - Pleased to meet you. I admire your work, Dr. Olavo. I really do. We must talk. Come on in. It's her, isn't it? She was brutally raped, wasn't she? I heard she was beaten to death! And your wife? She died in a car accident? Were you driving? No, she died alone. Her parachute didn't open. Our gossip columnist, Humberto de Campos. How are you? His wife was a skydiver! No need to meet this one! Because it's his party that's causing us all these problems. But he's adorable! - How are you? - Congressman Machado de Assis. Senator Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, from our party. Doctor, what do you say? We're waiting for the report. - So is our Party. - Absolutely! Our star reporter, Gregorio de Matos. - Excuse me for a moment. - Hello. The Senegalese Ambassador, Mr. Jean-Paul Sartre. Coroner Olavo Bilac. - My pleasure. - Mr. Bilac. Good evening. - Congresswoman! - Good evening. - Senator. - The Belle of the Congress! - You're so kind. - An honor, senator! Shall we? - Where's the man? - There. Listen, senator, will I be called to testify in the Inquiry Committee? Good evening. Keep quiet. I'll deal with this. Don't worry, Gon?alves. Martins. - Are you okay? Martins. - How are you? Dr. Bilac, congresswoman Georgesand Romero. - How are you? - Nice to meet you. Senator Romero. So, Professor... is the report ready? Well... no, there's nothing conclusive yet. Right. Very well. I hope at least dinner is ready. It is. Shall we go? - Let's have dinner, dear. - I'm not really hungry, Dad. Excuse me. Martins, the senator wants to talk to you. And you, are you hungry? No, I'm not hungry at all. A drink, maybe, would be fine. So, come with me. This has been the worst drought ever. You must drink water a lot! Were you married long? Excuse me. Hi, how are you? - Carlinhos, is your grandfather here? - Yes, he is. I just want to say hello. I think the congressman is bluffing when he asks for a Committee! Mr. Chairman. Senator. You wanted to see me, sir? You had to bring an honest man in here, goddamnit? I'm sorry, but I did tell your secretary... that I was advised to come with someone beyond reproach. That's why I hate the tropics! The heat addles people's brains! No one thinks! This country is occupied by intellectual midgets. No one thinks! Who said I wanted an honest person? Raimundo, take Martins in. His wife must be waiting. Excuse me. Don't worry. He's in good hands. Let's eat. She died. Period. I'm sorry. I'm just saying that you mustn't... mope forever like me... a yokel and divorcee. A divorce is far worse. Your life is defined. Death has prepared you for your future. You are alone. You'll always be alone, on your own... without any hope. She appeared to me on the plane and in the lab. Laura, my deceased wife. She... she saved me on the plane when I panicked. And then, in the lab... she appeared on the screen, and then she... she changed into Eug?nia. They were the same. I think I... I think I'd better go. I'll take you. There goes Miss Georgina. Let's go! Bras?lia by night! Eug?nia is alive. Just get it over with. It really is Eug?nia's body. Why can't you face that? My father's enemies, they love to take advantage... of a scandal like this. What do you want? Some kind of reward? Just name it. My Dad's gorillas are coming. Miss Georgina? Miss Georgina! Please, Miss Georgina! Miss Georgina! Please, Miss Georgina... Look what you're doing, Miss Georgina! We'll get the rap, Miss Georgina! Turn it down. Are you thinking about her? Eug?nia? Yes... Eug?nia. Know her nickname? Genius. You know why? Because she was. A genius. Genius. Eug?nia? - Genius! - Eug?nia? Very well. I'll send it right now. Very well. Thank you. Excuse me, I... You must be Dr. Olavo from Forensics. Please fill in this form and give it in tomorrow. It's just a formality. Doctor, this envelope is for you... and these two messages. Mrs. Francisca said she'll be here tomorrow morning... at eight o'clock sharp. I am at your entire disposal. - The key. - Of course. The key. Thank you, doctor. Forgive me. Hello? Very well. I'll send it right up. Thank you. WILL COME TO GET YOU AT 8 PM Hello? Hello, good evening. - Who is it? - It's me. - Who's speaking? - Oh! It's me... Who? Laura? May I come up? Sure. I'm waiting. Wait a minute! Who are you? - Who sent you here? - You did. Why did you say your name was Laura? I didn't. You did. You don't have to stay. I'll pay. Wait here. How much? Whatever you like. Just one more thing... can I sleep here on the couch? It's a long way home, and it's late. All right. I know this girl. Sir! Sir! Could you lend me the Bible? Yes? I'm on my way down. Thank you. Dr. Olavo? Up here, please. Wait a moment, Tobias. Dr. Olavo? Dr. Martins is waiting in the car. - Thank you, doctor. - How are you, Mrs. Francisca? You got the envelope with the papers? Yes, the photographs of your daughter. I'm sure she's alive. I know Dr. Martins is angry with me. But the body they found is not Eug?nia's. - I know. - The DNA... Very odd. Did they take your blood sample? Twice. That's how I know my daughter is alive. I am sure, doctor. She must have run away. - "Run away"? - Yes... from the senator's henchmen... the almighty S?lvio Romero. She worked for him since she got her PhD. - In Economics? - Yes, Economics. She was always studious, since kindergarten. She came first in the Ministry exam. And since she was so dedicated and competent... she was invited to work on the Budget Committee... presided by the senator. She worked so much... she even worked over the weekends. She even had to give up a short film. Yes, a short film with Augusto, her boyfriend. Meanwhile, in the Budget Committee... she began to realize she was involved in fraud. She had to alter previously approved numbers... in favor of the senator's friends and businesses. It's all here. Look, doctor. Then she started to ask questions, many questions. She's very smart, you know? The senator tried to involve her... first with lies and then with bribes. She resigned from the Committee and swore silence. Two days later, she went to a party... and never returned. Well, I must go. Did you keep any of her things? A milk tooth, a strand of hair? Let me know if you find anything, okay? Mrs. Francisca never gives up. - How did she find you? - She was a revolutionary. She's a bore, but I respect her. She's very courageous. You see Tobias is from the opposition. I'm no moralist, but here corruption reigns. - Take senator Romero... - Not the senator again! Now you'll say Augusto dos Anjos is innocent! No way! He's a worthless junkie! He killed his girlfriend and stuff! And she was no damsel, no saint, like her mother says. But senator Romero had a hand in the till for sure! How do you know "for sure"? - The Inquiry Committee will show that. - "Inquiry Committee"? Inquiry Committee! Tobias, you're a fool to believe in inquiry committees! If these committees were any good... half the Congress would be in jail. My God! Hello? - Dr. Olavo? - My God! This is Eug?nia, Eug?nia C?mara. - Where are you? - I can't tell you right now. - Bras?lia? - I can't tell you right now. - Where? - I must talk to you. - I'm so scared! - I need to talk to you. - Tell me where you are. - I can't, it's too dangerous. - I really need to talk to you. - Eug?nia? Eug?nia, listen... Hello? Hello? Hello? They're coming. Is the report ready? Since yesterday. CONCLUSION "Not compatible with Eug?nia C?mara"? Fuck! Are you crazy? You can't do that! It's not her. That corpse is not Eug?nia C?mara. You know it very well, so I can't sign this. If you care for your sister, you'll sign it! "It's compatible with Eug?nia C?mara"! She's alive. You've been listening too much to that woman. Don't you see she's just a mother... who can't accept the death of her only child? No, she's right. Eug?nia's alive. I've just spoken to her. You have no idea how this is important to me. Maybe you'll never do. But I beg you, for God's sake... sign this report now! I'm sorry, brother, but I can't. I can't sign this. Not now. I need more time. All right. 24 hours. We'll tell the press we are waiting for more data. Let's go, we're late. Therefore, we must put the press conference off until tomorrow... here, at the same time. Till tomorrow. - Dr. Martins? - Yes? - Dr. Martins? - Yes? Why did you bring a coroner from LA? The recommendation was always to bring a neutral authority... one who's above all suspicion. Dr. Olavo, did you autopsy your own wife? Did she die on a parachute jump? I'm sorry. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Dr. Olavo. Olavo, this is Greg?rio de Matos... an old friend and a good Bras?lia pioneer. How was your night? Some friends are waiting for us. Just a moment, please. Yes, take him to lunch. Take him to the car. Hello? Yes... Of course I have the report ready! But he didn't accept it... He said he'll sign it tomorrow. Fine. Fine. Eug?nia and Georgesand... were always the most beautiful women in Congress. In my opinion, in the whole town. Beautiful and mighty! They even say they both... Well, Eug?nia always worked as middleman... for big companies and some banks. She was irresistible. She vanished without a trace... no letter, no document. Augusto dos Anjos started to accuse the congressmen of all crimes. Absurd! Embezzlement, illegal financing, payoffs... bribes for voting, for the taking of public spaces. Anything as a cover-up for his own crime. The truth is very simple: He killed her out of jealousy. Of course... she was a babe, very beautiful. Of course Augusto dos Anjos couldn't take it... when he saw his girlfriend fucking ten men. It was he who killed her. They were together the last time she was seen. He invented the budget fraud to get himself off the hook. - Weren't they married? - No. That's why when he saw her fucking every man in that party... he decided to kill her. That was the last night she was seen in town. It's gonna be really tough if the body is not identified. - Congressmen are shitting bricks! - So is the President! Probably more so! They're just like that... Severino, my scotch, please! The identification of the corpse is vital, isn't it? Tell me, how hard can it be to identify someone... in the DNA era, in full 21 st century? This guy is almost a gringo, I don't trust him. But he's hiding... Dr. Olavo! Glad you could make it! Thank you, Greg?rio. Please sit down. Dr. Olavo, have you met all our friends? Next to my dear Greg?rio is Paula Ney... - Em?lio de Menezes. - Jo?o do Rio. And the great journalist Coelho Neto... who writes the most famous column in Bras?lia. Dr. Olavo, please forgive me, but I have to leave... because my television show will be on in 20 minutes. But I have one question: Why is the report unfinished? Well, it's... I still... I still have some tests to do. Dr. Olavo, she was beautiful, wasn't she? Isn't it time for your program? You saw her photos? The porn film! What an ass! What a body! - She has a body... a wonderful body! - Wonderful body. I saw her once at the Tennis Club! Coelho's too uptight to take part in such talk. He must have screwed her too. She kept him informed when she was a lobbyist. If he didn't screw her, he missed out! He was in love. I mean, he still is! I remember her affair with... ...the minister. - Under the covers! Yeah, but he found out. He ran into them in NY... when the President spoke at the UN, I know 'cause I was there... Coelho got really upset. But he still leaked her notes to the press. Legend has it that he was at the party. The party where she came out on top. Right, Raimundo? - She was a lady! - Was it ten or eleven? I'm not sure how many she screwed! I know Augusto dos Anjos was there, waiting for her. He was smashed on coke and booze! I think they left together. That was the last time she was seen. Doctor, a call for you. Hello? - Olavo? - Yes. Who is it? - It's me, Georgesand. - Oh, it's you. My driver's at the door. He'll bring you to me. I must talk to you. Dr. Olavo, are you going to leave us in suspense? With no outcome? Ever? He slipped out. Not a word! Not a morsel! So frugal! This is a set-up! Machado de Assis was at the party... The guy who came for him... That guy who came for him... wasn't that Georgesand's driver? Son of a bitch! What did I tell you? Where is she? Where are you taking me? Sobradinho. You don't know Bras?lia? - Of course I do. - Everybody ends up here. This is where the money is. That's not why I'm here. All right. I'm sorry, sir. I know why you're here. Because of that... Everybody knows. It is her body, isn't it? Why are you holding the whole thing up? Just sign the report! Or do you want a pay-off? - Who do you work for? - Calm down. I work for Miss Georgesand's team. I also work for the senator. I have served the family since I was a boy. You can trust me. I know she likes you a lot. Why don't you make things easy and get her father off the hook? I'm no politician. I merely do my duty as a physician. That's why you should listen to me... and bring an end to this story. I just go by the reports. I have a few details to add. It all started because Miss Georgina like to help people. You're too hard-line, Dad. It's serious. She wanted to help an institution for the blind. They had missed the deadline for the funds. It's simpler than you imagine. Right, Raimundo? It's unbelievably simple! It was Raimundo's idea. He decided to change the budget figures... even after Congress approval. ...with the intermediary numbers... They could do it, after all... it was to help the blind in Brazil, right? The next day, Raimundo proposed other associations... philanthropic ones. The elderly in the Northeast, the handicapped of Center West... each one had a parliamentary patron. - It's ironclad. - I really hate the tropics! Indeed! The tropics are awful. I wasn't made for this either. One day Raimundo brought the owner of Sigma Publicity. Dr. Gon?alves Dias, do you know him? He had an electoral campaign to finance. Pay-offs, fraud, you know. The senator agreed to help him... in exchange for a help for the blind. There's no problem. I'll deny it! I'll deny I even exist! Many executives followed his example. Everybody wanted to help the blind! It all went so well. Everyone was happy. Then Eug?nia C?mara turned up. She was employed by the Ministry Budget Board. Before, it was approved by a friend of the senator's. She wouldn't sign the payments. The shit hit the fan! Miss Georgina made friends with her. The Ministry leaves me no time for myself. But I always had my eyes on you. Eug?nia had this friend, Augusto dos Anjos... who wanted to make a movie. - Are you in it, as an actress? - No. No? You should, you're beautiful. - No way! - You are gorgeous! Come on, Georgesand?! No way! Any idea how much? Miss Georgina told the owner of Sigma, who helped the guy. And he made no film at all, he spent all the money on drugs! He'll talk to you. I think it's just another useless Brazilian film... no one will watch, but who cares? Eug?nia dumped him. But he got jealous... and murdered her. Miss Georgina is most upset about it. If you care for her at all... say the corpse is Eug?nia's. - Senator Antonio Manuel de Macedo. - Joaquim Manuel de Macedo! I'm sorry. Senator Joaquim Manuel de Macedo. Thank you for coming. Senator, we still have no report from forensics. Whatever the results... the filmmaker will make his statement tomorrow. He accused my fellow congressmen of rifling the Treasury. Please, come in. Olavo, this is Francisca. Sit down, please. I called you here for a very important reason. Francisca will tell you. Eug?nia is not my daughter. I raised her, but she's not my daughter. That's why you can't finish your job. Take this. This is her hair. And her birth certificate with her real mother's name. Excuse me. Today we are talking about political corruption in Brazil. I needed to see you again. I wanted you to know that I trust you... and I trust your work. And your father? Forget it. I'll guarantee your freedom. This is also a goodbye. I'm off to Miami. I won't take part in the Inquiry Committee hearings. Come with me. To Miami? I can't. Just sign this saying it is her, we'll leave and that's it. I have some of the dollars in my purse. The rest is in Miami, waiting for us. But I'm sure she's still alive. - She would have appeared by now. - No, she's afraid. She's in hiding, I'm sure! Corruption wasn't invented today. There are many examples from the time of the Empire. The situation today is more serious. It's even more blatant... I don't know, it's a very complex thing... It's now at a level never before seen. I think this crisis is really our salvation. It shows us a protagonist and an antagonist... which is the essence of theater. Paula Ney, tell us how the readers of "Time Magazine"... are receiving these developments? Via e-mail! Just joking! At the time of the Empire they also practiced... I have Science on my side. I am sure, I won't change my mind. The Patriarch of the Independency... Greg?rio, tell us... is corruption in Latin America endemic? Is it an intrinsic part of the culture? Get my purse, please. There's something in it for you. Come with me and forget them all. Eug?nia, Laura... everybody, starting with my father. I'm not going to Miami. You know that. Good night. Dr. Olavo, please. It's raining messages for you! Looks as if you're much in demand! - My key. - Of course. Please. URGENT I never left Bras?lia. I was hiding at a friend's farm. But now I want to get out of here. Know what I'm going to do? No. What? Have you ever read Hetzel, a Jewish poet or something? He said: "If you desire, then is not a dream." What do you desire? What I desire? I want to study more. A post-doctorate at Berkeley... or maybe in Florida, Miami. - Berkeley? - Berkeley. My thesis will be on Brazil's economic dependence... and its social issues. But I don't want to stay there. Like me? I want to come back. I will be back. Lalo? I was thinking about our vacation. - Nothing can be changed. - No reason why. We'll split the time, half in Bras?lia... half in Rio. Your sister won't mind. She's waiting for us for her house warming. - Olavo, Rio de Janeiro! - All you want is hang-gliding. You bet! Me, gliding over the deep, blue sea... over the forest! I want to fly! Not now! I have to get up early tomorrow for my jump. Olavo! You can never imagine what I'm going to do tomorrow. A free-fall parachute jump! Laura? Eug?nia? Where were you? You disappeared! What the fuck?! I need to talk to you right now! Okay, I'm on my way. - Tell me where you are. - No, no, no. I'll send the car for you. - Just don't disappear! - Okay, I'll be waiting. Fine. Let's go, Martins. You'd better go, Martins. MACHADO DE ASSIS AND AUGUSTO DOS ANJOS WILL BE THE FIRST TO TESTIFY Honorable gentlemen, the accusations were made against my party... not against this humble representative of the Brazilian workers. What they want is to stain the flag of public morals... hoisted in glory by my party from the very start! I will open my bank account, telephone and finances... to all public scrutiny. I shall prove my innocence! Each of you will bear witness! These politicians! Call me a cab, please. Here's the address. Riacho Fundo, doctor? It's a long way, but he can get you there. Just a second. I'll take the doctor. Wait while I get the car. Riacho Fundo. - Where's the man? - He took the cab. Give the key to 510! Put it right there. This is for you. - And this is for you. - For me? Thank you. - And this is yours. - Thanks. And this is mine. Look! Is that Z? Maria? It's not Z? Maria, it's him! It's my friend. It's here! Come on in! - Shall I wait? - Yes. Is this yours? Josefine, bring some coffee. I said, is this yours? - No, I don't wear one. - Were you at the hotel last night? - Did you sleep with me last night? - No. I didn't work yesterday. I didn't need to, so I took the day off. I spent the money you gave me. - Is he in there? - Who? How much? - Go away! Beat it! - It's Z? Maria! Just go! I've come to pick you up. You'd better have some coffee. Your things are in the car. You can't miss this flight. Let's go. Yes, I met Eug?nia once. It was at a party. They hired some girls, and we went there. But it was a trap for Eug?nia. She arrived there with her boyfriend who, my God... was he stoned! But she soon realized that it was a set-up for her... and she tried to leave. But they grabbed her on her way out... and the drivers raped her. I stayed with her until after everybody had left... after the end of the party. The poor girl! I called a cab and took her home. She wouldn't stop crying. She didn't say a word. She didn't even swear, not once. I felt so sorry for her. - And her boyfriend? - He vanished. He was snorting and totally smashed. I think some friend helped him out. And I saw his face... he didn't even care about the rape. But to say he killed Eug?nia... I really don't think so. He's no murderer. Did you ever see her again? No, she disappeared. But if she was murdered... I'm sure it wasn't he who killed her. Look, that's the deal: They're in there waiting for you. You will sign that report the way they want you. Your sister is being held in the presidential suite... with Dr. Tobias, your brother-in-law's assistant. There are photos of them both naked, and they'll publish them... if you don't sign this fucking report... saying the corpse is who she is! Take it easy, doctor. I'll take you to Dr. Martins. You keep your head down and wait. You ruined my life, you son-of-a-bitch! You selfish prick! Let me go! There's no room for pity in your Science! Let me go! Fuck! See what you've done to your sister! If you don't sign it now, the photos will be out on TV today! First, let Maria go. I'll only sign it... when Martins and Maria are out of here! Do you hear? Do you? He said he'll sign if we let her go. And I want the negatives, photos and tapes! Say it! He wants the negatives, photos and tapes. - Bring Martins on his own. - Dr. Fontes. Very good! Right on, sir, don't back down! I just don't get one thing, doctor. Why didn't you fight back before? You'd have got dough and the senator's friendship. Not to mention Miss Georgina's love! It was a piece of cake, man! The tapes? Put the stuff on the table. This is her hair. Eug?nia's, the girl. Her mother gave it to me. Now we can know the truth. DEPONENT It's easy to accuse. It's like casting the first stone. A game of all or nothing. And I say to you, ladies and gentlemen... that this stone merely grazed me. Not I myself... for my life is my shield and witness. With what purpose should stones be cast? To shatter the Federal Senate, to which I belong. The work of the insane and maladjusted... as is he who would accuse me. A liar, a murderer... a despicable criminal. Excuse me. I must say that... it gives me much pleasure that the truth is being known. You all know me. You all know that I have always governed my public life... by the ethics and the morality of this country. I thank you very much. If she calls, tell her... Your bag, sir. God bless you. Let's go, sweetheart. I am an artist. I may have my faults and vices... but I'm no thief and no murderer. Unlike those accused here... on the basis of Eug?nia's documents... which were seized by the police. So if you see a spade, call it a spade. Crocodile tears! The jungle that is Brazil. Because these senators and congressmen... are nothing but a gang of criminals! Money for the blind and yet nobody sees! Money for orphans! And who is being abandoned today? It all comes down to money! Money! Here money squawks louder than the loudest bird! I'm going away to money. Money is my friend! A whole world with vast sums of money! I'm an artist! I'm no thief or murderer! I'm a Brazilian artist! Sir? Thank you. THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION ANY SIMILARITY WITH PERSONS LIVING OR DEAD IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL
