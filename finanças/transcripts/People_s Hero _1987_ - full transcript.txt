And there's a gunfire when police arrived. Now the robbers are still holding hostages. According to our source, one of the robbers is Sunny Koo. He is suspected to kill an inspector at Central and two policemans at Cheung Sha Wan last year. At the road side memorial ceremony, the fellow police swore to revenge. And caused some criticism from papers. It's Cap. Cheung. Cap. Cheung is here. Let me ask him some questions. Cap. Cheung... - Cap. Lee, where's Chan? - Cap. Lee. Over there! Congratulations, you get him finally! Chu and Kin can rest in peace! And where are the special force? At next street. Kill that son of a bitch! Cheung, it is Sunny Koo. You want all the hostages dead? What else can we do? He wanted a van and the senior approved. Ok, give him a van and get him when he comes out. Buy some coffee and tea, my treat! Thank you Cap. Cheungl... He promised to give me a van. We can leave soon! Everything's Ok, don't be scared. I need someone to drive for me. Anyone here have a license? Do you drive often? No, after I got my license, I rent a car few times. Should be alright, except at slopes. How about you? No, he's used to drive automatics. I haven't tried a van. |'|| drive! Don't tell me you can't drive. Ican't. I failed three times. Did you try driving without a licensee? No way, I'll be prohibited to take the driving test. Give me your wallet. Give me your wallet. Hurry! You said you didn't have a licensee? How many years? Five years! Which model do you usually drive? Celica, 1600 cc... bright... red. What? No, I said the car is red! What are you afraid of? I am not going to force you if you don't want to! Brother... let me drive! Can you drive? Yes, he used to drive for a living! Do you know how many years of imprisonment you'll get? Carry a gun! Armed robbery! Attempt murder! Taking hostage! You've a long term ahead. You won't be able to leave! It's not good for you. Yes, I know. But it's not bad for me too. It's our fault. But I don't want to. If you ask anyone of them to drive, if they cheat, what can we do? I'm different! I don't want to get caught. I'll do my best! Look at you! It will last for two months. Where can you hide? Who have a cigarette? I do! Here! Sorry, I do not intend to... It's alright! Excuse me! Give me that. Idon't intend to! You keep it! Thank you very much! Please don't lean on me. Can I go to the toilet? Me too! Does she want to leave you? Women are so trouble—some. They say you are wasting their time of not marry. Yes... And gets so picky if you propose. Marry her sooner, it'll be alright if you get married. Where's the money to get married! - Are you married? - Not yet! But I have a girlfriend. In mainland China? Do I look like those new immigrants from China? Aren't you? I thought you are from Wu Nan Bong. How do you plan your robbery? Just have a chat, do you have a plan? Sometimes, first look at the environment! Did you research on the escape route? A little! Wife, the film we saw? At Golden Harvest! It's an "American tail". No, it's "Long Arms of Law". What they say in the film was true? Quite true! Sit down and have a chat. They got their story from two new immigrant criminals. I like criminal movies. Are there really so many guns in H.K.? So many gunfire. A few hundred, I guess! I'll be careful next time when I go out! Once my Benz had a flat tire in front of a jewelry shop. It Banged, a lot of people stooped down on the street. I heard that you can rent a gun, is it true? Excuse me, I have to make a phone call! Go on!! - Hello? Yes! - Cap. Chan! Bring by girlfriend over. No way! No way? You have no right to say this! You bring by girl over. I'll release the guard. He is wounded. You don't want trouble, do you? Alright, release all the hostages. Don't bullshit, do it at once. Did you ask him to bring your girlfriend? Don't do it, it is dangerous here. She's in prison now. Is she a criminal too? Last time when I escaped from the police, they found a pistol and bullet in her wallet. And sentenced her for five years. - It's unfair! - Yes! I can't go by myself, leaving her alone. It's lucky talking to you, or else l'|l forget. Yes! Government officers are slow. Sorry keep you waiting. - It doesn't matter! - Have a chat! - I'm not in a hurry! - Yes. You are not going to release his girlfriend, are you? What else can I do? He has so many hostages. Let the negotiating expert talk to him! Idon't choose to talk to him. He asked for me... You should be firm to him! How can I? You know who he is. Who cares! We have two hundred guns pointing at him. You give him anything he wants. If he asks for a plane, will you give him? Man, bring the negotiating expert here. Yes, sir. Let's have a talk about it. We play Taiwan Mahjong these days. How to play Taiwan Mahjong? There are 16 tilts, 3 more tilts than Canton Mahjong. 16 tilts? It must be very long! The tilts themselves are smaller, so it's not long. The rules are similar, but the loser pays all. The loser pays all? Yes, the loser pays all. This is great! It must be lots of money? Buddy, how much is this? About twenty thousand! These days in Hong Kong, even a paging machine, it's not good enough. You have to have this. When you Change a new one, can you sell this to me? This is my card, come visit me sometime. There're lot of great chicks. Really? Young girl, you won't regret! This is no good. Maybe you can bleach it at a beauty parlour. Or sun bath for a few days at Repulse Bay. But don't use suntan oil. Take it, afraid? Good! Whom did you rent it from? I found it in a ship. I worked at a shipyard. When you found the pistol, you quit your job to rob? I own money from loan sharks. Because of gambling? I bought some fake Rolex to sell it at temple street and was caught by police. I lost everything. Is it a large amount? About thirty thousand. But we only borrowed five thousand. I don't understand you people. There're so many banks. Why go to loan sharks? Do you rob to pay back the loan shark? They would kill us if we couldn't pay on Monday. Look at this, they already beat me up! You have a gun, return him with a bullet! I can't do this? Why not? They can beat you up. Why can't you return them with a bullet? It's no point killing with a mere thirty thousand. Crazy? But you nearly killed the guard! What are you doing? Who are you calling? To loan shark Chuen. Don't... - Get away! - Are you crazy? Stand still. - Ask loan shark Chuen to the phone. - Wait a minute. Chuen, you bastard, did you beat my pal up? Better not... if I see you... or I'll shoot you, you bastard! Who are you... I'm your elder brother, Ah Sai... Don't be so mad! We'll talk it out! Let's have a talk! What did he say... He said let's talk it out. I told you to talk to him! Why don't you go and talk to him first? What? It's you who own him money. You talk to him! Why don't you talk to him? Why? Ok... that's enough! What's the use of quarrelling! Lot's of money here, get and hire a lawyer! Sunny Koo, the van is here. Cap. Chan, where's my girlfriend? The boss won't approve. He didn't approve? Ask him to talk to me. I can't locate him on Saturday. You can't or you won't? The van is at the front door. You'd better go! Why are you so anxious? Are the gunmen having a hard time on roof? That's it, Cap. Chan, I have been patient enough. Don't force me to kill! Koo, you give me some time! You got it? Put your boss on the line. Won‘t they release your girlfriend? Yes, it's unreasonable. Idon't think they will let her out! No, they will. They dare not to. What's matter? Afraid that I will kill you? | just wanted to scare him! But if they really... What's wrong with you? I told you I would not kill you. Why don't you believe me? You did kill people? They are police! | robbed that jeweler shop. They chased after me. That bastard is a runner. He chased me for two street. I was wearing leather shoes. The road is rugged. Iran till I ran out of breath. That bastard was still chasing. It's incredible. His boots were heavier than mine. No reason he could make it. Ran and ran, he's getting closer. He must want a promotion. I turned and fired. He fired back. But missed luckily. That's why you wear running shoes. These are not running shoes. You should buy a wider, dumber one. Those are for running. You haven't finished yet. What happened next? I forget. | only remember how my buddy died. Idon't want to kill. When I shot the first policeman, I prayed for him the whole night. Idon't want him to die. How long do you think this action will take? It's hard to say. We don't know their exact position. But it shouldn't be longer than 50 sec. 50 Sec? All the hostages will be dead! Cheung, believe me! He Will kill if you push him! It is he who kills the hostages. Not us! How can you disregard the lives of the hostages! All because he killed two police. Don't get personal. What are you talking about? The two dead police are not my men, they are yours! Do you think I don't want to get him? He escaped twice from my hand! I am damned enough! Why he picks you? He is not afraid of you. Don't let him make use of that. If you don't want to lose face, let the force do it. No way, I'd rather he escaped again. Idon't want anybody to die again. Alright... this time you let him go. Because we have the hostages in mind. It's not that bad! But if he leaves with his girl, we're shamed to go back to the station. Now the TV is live broadcasting. Everybody will know our name. Don't you understand? - So what? - Stop... Don't argue, let me think about it. Singh, don't read those cartoons. Go and clean up the place! I'm talking to you. Do you hear me, Singh? Don't call me Singh! I do have a name! My name "Manson" is on the application form. Manson, can't you see that! Don't argue... forget it... Why argue? You are all working under the same roof. - Is your hand alright? - It's alright. Thank you for your bandage. Don't mention it, are you afraid working as a guard? Yes, of course I'm afraid! How bad luck I have. Today is my holiday. You are lucky. If I shot, you are dead now! You are quite smart, why rob? You are smart too! Then why work as a guard? We are different. Nobody will employ us. I thought that I could save up some money. And open up a curry shop at Tsim Sha Tsui. Do you know how to cook curry? Yes, of course! And then go back home! But I don't think I can make it now! Why? 1997 is getting close! It makes no differences to you, being an Indian! No, I'm from Pakistan! - It's all the same. - No, it's different. How much do you need? Is this enough? Come on! No, I can't take it! Manager, you'll be the witness. This is my pocket money. Come on, there are lots inside! Ah Sai, you drive for me. What are you doing? You don't want to report yourself? Think about it, they'll give you more than ten years. Hey kid, speak out if you don't want to drive! |'|| drive, why not? Take the money! You need them on the run! He only drives for me, don't be scared. Sorry. I didn't mean it. I was so scared! Forget it. If you didn't shoot me, I would shoot you! Are the money clean? Yes, don't worry, they are clean... Check if the money is record! It's alright. They are used money! They want to blow the door up! 14,13 What are you trying to do, Chan... Hold it. |'|| tie all the hostages up at the door. Come on, blow it if you have the guys! Send them away, right now! Send them away! He can see us. Over! Spread, and remove it! Remove the detonators... Remove all the detonators... Sunny Koo, you cool down first. Let's talk! Who are you? I'm Cap. Cheung, Serious Crime Section from H.O. Where's Chan? Now I'm taking control. He's afraid of me? Now it's your turn to have a good time with me. Alright, you come in... See whether you kill me. Or I kill some of the hostages! Don't fuss with me! You listen, I'll leave by nine. If you don't send my girlfriend over by 8:30, |'|| Kill the hostages. Is that a video camera at that door? People inside can see us. Why didn't you remove it? Remove it! Remove the video camera at the door. Hold it... No way, you are forcing him to kill more. Listen to him or we'll have big trouble! Cap. Cheung, why don't... What's the matter? You go away! What's wrong? Is he sick? Yes, he has some problem with his heart! Dear, wake up! Ah Sai, give me a hand. He's in a coma! Madam, please hold him, don't panic! Dear! He's breathing... Dear... Don't disturb him, let him have a rest. Dear, how do you feel? Don't scare me. Those police are crazy! They shouldn't blow the door. They'll kill us! - You are right... - They are not human. Right... they won't let your girlfriend out. If you don't scare them. I am not searing them. If necessary... |Wi|| kill! Where should we go later with the car? I'll tell you later.

Idon't want to hurt you. But if I don‘t kill, they won't let me go. I think one of you have to be sacrificed. You'd better take the draw to decide! It's more fair! Any one get any matches? - No, don't! - It's none of your business! You drive your car. Let's stone, paper, scissors! We got too many people here. It's low! Ok, let's do this! Ho-ma... Like this!
