800 killed, 2,000 injured. American working men slaughtered at their benches. Is it part of our job Mr. Secretary to stand by and do nothing? Officially our relations with the imperial German government are friendly. And yet we're being attacked, not by troops in uniform... by an internal army of spies, saboteurs and propagandists. Are the victims of the black Tom explosion any less dead... because their blood was shed unofficially? That is something congress must face Mr. Corvall. It is something congress should've faced long ago. Will we as a nation ever learn the distinction between tolerance and stupidity? But I don't understand what this is all about. What are they shooting each other for? - Madam, they're having a revolution. - Revolution? - Good heavens, will it come over here? - No madam. - How do you know they won't? - Tangier is protected by international law. Young man, don't you know that revolutionists don't obey the law? I demand to be protected by the United States government. - You will be madam. - That's better. But I can't understand, why can't I go into Morocco? It's on my schedule, I paid for it. There, you see? Fifth day, breakfast at Tetuan, leave by caravan for desert. Now it's the seventh day, all my plans upset. I may not be able to go to the desert after all. Madam, there are other deserts you can go to. Next please. What is this, a wake? I can't stay here forever. There goes my vacation. What you going to do with us now? Why can't you get us hotel rooms? Will you please tell me how we can get a boat out of here? Please please. I realize what you've all been through. Now, if you'll just be patient a little longer. - You can't soft soap me young fella. - Quite sure of that. You got to get me out of this dump today, I got business. You got to get me out of here, quick. Be glad to get you out as quick as we can. What's yours Barry? - Theota Road. - Mine is the Old Gate. Well, we split here then, I go straight east. How do you suppose so many Americans got to Morocco in the first place? Oh, travel folders, I suppose. Africa must sound good after Medicine Hat. Give me Medicine Hat, they don't have air raids. Keep your feet dry. This is an outrage, I'm an American citizen and I demand my rights. I demand protection against those foreigners out there. You just tell them who you are Phineas, tell them who you are. I'm Phineas T. O'Grady, chairman of the National Dollar Day Committee. - Don't mean a thing to him. - Maybe they don't speak English. Sure, me work in Brooklyn... uno, dos, tres, 8 years ago. You all right, only don't run, they shoot you. You fat, you eat too much. Oh, never mind that, I demand to be allowed to go along. What are you keeping us here for? I demand to go on. Just a minute, just a minute, I'm Corvall, of the United States consulate. - You all American? - Yes. You're darn tooting we are. Now, let's have a little action around here, why don't keep... Easy, easy. These gentlemen are officers, they're merely doing their duty. Oh, so you're going to take their side of it, are you? Now, wait till my congressman hears about this. Now, just a minute, just a minute, let me see your passports. Here's mine sir. - All right. - Thank you. Here's mine. - My wife, daughter and myself. - Well, where's yours? Oh, I can't find it. What difference does it make? - Don't we look like Americans? - You couldn't be mistaken... but the formality is required. I've no time to argue with you young man, I demand my rights. All right. For the time being, just give me your name, your place of birth and your residence. The name is O'Grady, and we're from Queens on Brooklyn. Thank you Mr. O'Grady. All right, I'll vouch for them, they're from Brooklyn. Ok, Brooklyn. Come here, quick. - I know you. - Yes. Can you make it? I think so. Nerves, I guess. I've never been frightened before, not like this. Oh, it's awful. - Where will we go? - Tangier. Oh, it'll be the same there. - No. - We'll be interned. No, we got friends there. We go get passports, Muller is there. Wait. Fraulein, Muller is here. Herr Muller will see her. I'm as surprised as I am delighted. Allow me to present, is it still miss Ballard? - It is. - Herr Strawn. How do you do? - You come from Morocco. - Yes. Suppose you tell us about it. I was touring with a company from the Madrid opera. The, I guess you'd call it a revolution broke out. We were taken to headquarters and questioned. My papers of identity were taken from me. You know why. Afterward, I was interned but I managed to escape. Miss Ballard is an American. She was left destitute in Geneva, wasn't it? By the death of her parents. At the time, we needed the assistance of an attractive young woman and miss... Ballard fit into our plan admirably. On several other occasions she was of service to the organization. Later, there was a regrettable exposure... and I suspect that her papers have been a sort of trouble to her ever since. I see. And you are here because you wish an American passport. Yes. Please... - you owe me that. - Yes. Miss Ballard is unknown in America. I'm sure she would be useful. In return for the passport, you will of course expect to render us... - a slight service from time to time. - Oh yes, I'll do anything... anything to get out of this, to have a little peace. Not to see death anymore, not to be hounded. Just a moment please. Have your passport ready. - Is that all? - Yes, that's all. Oh, it's you. Yes and I'm not looking for my aunt Minnie either. Well, that's one American we won't have to worry about. Bless her sweet soul, what's up Dud? Just dropped in to say goodbye. - Yeah? Where to? - Everywhere, anywhere. - Which side of the street? - Side trouble is on. Right now it looks like Spain. Fuse is sputtering there... but the explosion might come in Austria, Poland, China, I don't know. Remind me not to apply for an appointment in those places Barry. Doesn't matter, Europe is full of powder kegs. And there's an American State Department man sitting on every one. Unpleasant thought. But Barry and I are through with powder kegs after Saturday. - Going into the foreign service school. - Congratulations. - When do you take off? - Sailing on the Fredonia. Well, study hard. Maybe you'll have a bigger powder keg to sit on someday. But while you're holding this one down, take my tip... and watch out for the fancy pants guys. They'll liable to steal the consulate before your successor gets here. - You wouldn't mean spies, would you? - I would. This place is an anthill of them. And when you get back to the states, try to convince them... that isolation is a political policy and not a brick wall around the nation. The fancy pants guys walk right through political policies. I'll try and remember that Dud, but right now I'm so busy with my lost sheep... - that I... - Please... If you please. You see? Chilled. - Not a doctor in the house. - Take her in that other room. Am I keeping you? Well, as a matter of fact, you are. I've an appointment to meet a bunch of Iowa tourists and go quietly insane. Please do. - If you'll excuse me. - Of course we'll excuse you. - Is this a habit? - What? Fainting in consulates, here. - Bless you. - What? Bless you. Oh yes, I sneezed. It's been so long since I heard that. You been away from the United States long miss... - Miss Ballard? - Yes, a long time. - This is smudged, isn't it? - Oh yes, the rain, it got wet, you know. Yes, so did you, you feel up to a few questions? Of course. - Who would you like to have notified? - Of what? Of your safety, of course, your family must've known you were in the war zone. Heaven knows how you got across the border without being shot, but as long as you did... you might as well let the folks in on it. It's on uncle Sam, you know. Thanks, I haven't any family. - Well, about your friends? - Haven't any friends either. Well, it's incredible, there must be someone to notify. - What about your enemies? - I don't think they'd be interested. Miss Ballard, you're hiding something from me, now don't tell me you ran away from home. Do I have to tell you the story of my life now? No, of course not, go ahead. Finish the rest of your medicine. - Oh, it's bitter. - Well, it's regulations. You know, my mother used to make me take that every time I got a cold. Either that or she rubbed me all over with camphor oil. - Now, of course if you'd prefer I'd be... - I'll take the medicine. Right. Practically cured. You intend going back to the United States soon miss Ballard? - Yes. - Good, should. - Why? Am I that much trouble? - No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I'm sailing too. Going back to the foreign service school in Washington. You know, take sort of a postgraduate course in... what to do with charming young ladies that faint in your consulate. You seem to know already, you've been very kind. Purely in the line of duty. If I can be of any further service. Could you tell me if there's a ship sailing soon? Yes, as a matter of fact, there are two, the Ocean Queen and the Fredonia. But the fredonia, there's a ship, that's the one I'm sailing on. Now, if you'd like, I'd be glad to arrange accommodations for you. Well, if it wouldn't be too much trouble. You think it would be possible to get something that's not very expensive? You see, all I have left is a letter of credit... and when I get through buying the clothes I need... Now, don't you worry about a thing, I'll get at it immediately. You are kind. Purely in the line of duty. - In the line of duty? - Well, yes. They taught me that in the service. But as a matter of fact, this is the first time I've been enthusiastic about the idea. I'll have this fixed up for you. This isn't mine. - Yes miss, this is cabin C-22. - Oh no, there must be some mistake. No miss, there's no mistake. - Pleasant crossing miss. - Thank you. Why didn't we just come aboard as stowaways? - Is there anything wrong old man? - Well, you see nothing wrong I suppose. No, I can't say that I do. Nothing wrong, eh? We book first class passage and look what we get. A miniature Turkish bath, a steam heated phone booth. Yes? Oh, hello. Plumber's idea of heaven, a pipe fitter's nightmare. Quiet. What? Oh, that? Well, we have a dog in our cabin. Yes, he's been yelping and crying ever since we got underway. Self respecting Airedale wouldn't be found dead in this supercharged flea trap. You mean to tell me this is an inexpensive cabin? Well, it's just what I told you I'd pay. Well you know, they were going to put you down in some dinky little old hole and... Lowell wouldn't stand for it. - No sir, he used his political pull. - So I've got political pull, have I? Then I'm going to use it right away to get us out of this pint sized barbecue pit. - Now, give me that phone. - The purser please. Give me the phone. Will you marry me? Will you marry me? It says here darling, why won't you marry me? Will you marry me? Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Bit misty, eh? The fog, I mean. Fish swimming around in the stuff, dangerous to navigation.. Yeah. Our stateroom is somewhere around here but I'll be hanged if I can find it. You shouldn't give up so easily old boy. - Perhaps not, you don't mind if I shove on? - Oh, no, not at all. - But why darling? Tell me why. - Please Barry. Look Brenda, as soon as this fog lifts we'll be in New York. Then in a few minutes, we'll be all mixed up with other people and things. Unimportant people and things but... they may get us separated and I couldn't stand that darling. Oh, yes you could Barry. It'd be the best thing for you. Besides, you, you'd have your work and your career. But you don't seem to understand I'm head over heels in love with you. - You're my career. - No, I'm not Barry. Yes, Brenda. Why do you think I joined the consulate service? Why do you think I was sent to Tangier? So I'd be there when you came walking in. I know why you joined the service Barry. Remember what you told me about your father? And how much your career means to your mother? Look, I've been trying to ask you a simple question... 50 times a day for the last 5 days and you keep dragging my career into it. Oh, why don't you give me a simple answer? The first time you asked me I didn't think you meant it. - After that I, I was afraid you did. - Why? Why were you afraid? - Because I love you. - You what? Because I love you. - Now, don't force me to tell you the rest. - What else is there to tell? About me. The reasons why I can't marry you. The reasons why it would be unfair to you... to your mother, to your career, if I did marry you. - Barry, what do you know about me? - Everything. I know that I love you and that you love me and that's all I want to know. - You don't understand. - Yes, but I do understand. Whatever it is you're afraid of is a long way off, yesterday swallowed it up. Today and tomorrow and all the rest of the tomorrows belong to us together. All the tomorrows? Barry, if it could be? Lost again, can't find it for the life of me. Say, would you mind doing that again, I mean, what you were doing? Gladly. - Barry. - Mother. Oh, my dear. Oh, how are you? Never felt better in my life, six days of sea breezes, you look fine. Washington breezes maybe, there plenty of them. Looks like they agreed with you. - Lowell, welcome home. - Thanks Mrs. Corvall, it's nice to see you. Mother, I have a surprise for you. Miss Ballard, Brenda. So glad to meet you. Well Mrs. Corvall, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll be getting along. - Oh, come with us. - No thanks, I've to go on to Richmond. - Call you when I get back Barry. - Right. Good bye. Well mother, I'm here too. Of course, I don't blame you for not being able to take your eyes off Brenda. I can look at you at home. Is your home in Europe? Oh, that is I never think of it as home. - She's a waif mother. - A waif? Really Barry. If you want to be technical, a refugee, but I think waif is a much nicer name for it. Say, could we drop this little waif off at the Kaslan house on our way home? I'm sure we can. Come here skipper, glad to see me? It's good to be home after the way things are in Europe. Barry, who's Brenda? Oh, I told you about her. I mean, how I met her. Oh, are you very much in love? Do I show it that much? How do you like her? Oh, I like her as much as I've ever liked anyone after seeing her for 10 minutes. But you won't be surprised at me... when I'd seen her for 10 minutes, I decided to marry her. Have you asked her to marry you? You don't mind, do you? Barry, I wouldn't stand in the way of you happiness for anything in the world. Thanks mother. All the same, I have an idea that you'd be glad to know that she turned me down. Yes I am Barry. But you probably won't take her first answer as final. - Well now, what would be your advice? - My advice... Is to remember that marriage is a very important thing in any man's career... - especially a diplomat's. - I know that mother. Perhaps you don't know what a promising career you have. You've done very well in the service, I heard that from several people in the department. Well, that's not bad on the ears. You know dear, your father and I had such ambitions for you... that you should've a career as distinguished as his. And be as happy as he was too, I hope. What do you really know about Brenda? - Well, what do I have to know? - A great deal, I should think. I know, mother, but... That's the way it is in diplomacy, you have to take chances. You take a chance that wins, they call you a farseeing statesman. You take a chance that loses, they call you an impractical blunderer. But if you don't take any chances at all... you wake up one morning and find the whole parade is passed you by. I don't want that to happen to me. Information, get me the Kaslan house please. With European war shadows deepening daily... you men have been brought back to Washington... to prepare yourselves for duties that henceforth will be more difficult than ever. As at the outbreak of the last war, you will need great care, tact, caution. But beyond that, the most important thing for you to carry on with you is this... remember you are Americans, representing America... and the American policy of maintaining peace. It is on the basis of your confidential reports to this department... that our government operates this policy. One of your most difficult tasks... will be the sending in of reports of conditions as they really are... not as the other fellow's foreign office wants you to believe they are. Remember you cannot let sympathy or prejudice affect your reports to this department. The flags designate the 349 outposts of the department... the embassies, legation, consulate offices and agencies. Each of these outposts operate under the fundamental principles of the service... which is to recognize the sanctity of treaties... and the equality of all men and nations, strong and weak alike... under the protection of international law. - Looks pretty mysterious, doesn't it? - Sure does. Let me have one. - It's almost human. - Better, it doesn't talk. Ever since the world war, we've been trying to perfect a machine... that would encode and decode automatically. Well, here it is. What's to prevent a foreign power from using the same kind of machine? It would do them no good unless they had a key to each message. The machine offers a variation of 2,372 entirely original codes. That would give any inquisitive outsider... 2,371 chances of being wrong, even if he had the machine to work with. Does this machine take the place of all former code books? Oh no, not at all, we have these also. You must remember, secrecy of diplomatic codes... is as important to our national defense as the Army and Navy. Totalitarian countries show no mercy to spies... whose fate is the ax, guillotine or the firing squad. In this country, we are more tolerant with spies. Many foreign spies enter this country on forged passports. This one was the real thing. Apparently, was stolen from the person it was issued to... then cleaned up with ink eradicator, the serial number changed..., and this photograph pasted in. There are, however, organized rings who deal in forged passports... making it a comparatively simple matter for spies to obtain them. - Good luck. - Thanks, Barry. Same to you. Mr. Peyton, what's your opinion of the present situation? Unofficially, you mean? You see, we are the richest storehouse of war material in the world... and both sides want access to it, hence, our present state of affairs.. Let me show you gentlemen, how history repeats itself. About 20 years ago, our country was infested with a secret army of... spies, enemy agents and saboteurs. And although their machine was hastily thrown together, they were able to wreck Bridges... blow up factories and munition plants, sink American ships... spread disease in the stockyards and set incendiary fires in our forests. Finally, congress took action and gave us protective laws and counterespionage. But, was too late to keep us out of the war. Today, we are in exactly the same position that we were 20 years ago- Up against the same fear of spies... and what may be the same kind of violence and disaster. Well, just why were those protective laws repealed? Congress considered them a wartime measure and, after the war, repealed them. And the pity of it is that today we need them more than we did then... because today we have an alien army on American soil that is much... better organized than it was 20 years ago... and in a far better position to plunge the country into... chaos the moment the word of command is given. It's a pity the State Department can't do anything about it. It is. But unfortunately, we are not a counterespionage organization. The rooting out of spies has to be done by the Department of Justice... and Army and Navy intelligence. But what does concern us is this... that these spies and saboteurs I speak of... are in league with some of those who we will find buzzing around... the agencies, legations and consulates. So be on your guard. It almost makes one wonder what's the use of defending our American rights abroad... if no one bothers to defend them at home. Well, the only way I can answer that is by asking you all to do the best you can. If America, lacking the protective laws it needs, is drawn into another war... it will be because of those human ostriches who keep their heads buried in the sand. This, of course gentlemen, is off the record. That's all gentlemen, thank you. What I get? Greenland, congratulations. That's a swell place for you Lowell, now you can spend your weekends at the North Pole. - Do they always do that? - Oh yes, always. They pretend to believe they'll be sent wherever the dart strikes on the map. - Does it ever happen? - It did once, my husband hit Russia. Few minutes later, he heard he's going there. I'll try my luck. - What I get? - Germany. - Germany? - Now please be seated gentlemen. I will now read your assignments in the order of your final standings in the class. Mr. Sabin Dawson, third secretary assigned to the embassy at London, Great Britain. Mr. Barry Corvall, third secretary assigned to the embassy of Paris, France. Mr. Lowell Warrington, vice-consul assigned to the consulate at Geneva, Switzerland. Lovely party, isn't it? That's officially. Privately, I'd much prefer a clambake. - Have you seen Barry? - No, I thought he'd be here. He should be. Lowell, you think you could again forget that officially you're a diplomat? Surely, turn it on and off like a tap. Fine, tell me, what do you know about miss Ballard? - She's a charming girl, don't you think? - I think you're turning it on again. At least you'll agree that she's lovely to look at. Yes, Barry seems to think so. I wouldn't worry if I were you, Barry is no fool. What man isn't, when he's in love? - Good evening Mr. Corvall. - Good evening. - Nervous, are you? - A little. - I'll see if I can find mother. - Don't be long. Good evening. - Lowell... - Oh, hello Barry. - Will you wait for Brenda for me? - Surely. Will you excuse me? Why so late dear? Well I, I think I have the best excuse in the world for being late. Now, what are you trying to tell me? Well I... I'll be leaving Washington soon for a new post and... well, there wasn't much time, so Brenda and I decided to... There didn't seem to be any reason for delay. - So you're married. - That's about it. Let me be the first to wish you happiness dear. Thank you mother. You don't seem very surprised. Well, did say you made up your mind and I know when you do that... You mind telling me when and where it happened? In Baltimore, this morning. - Will you bring your wife to meet me now? - So we're forgiven? There's very little you could do that I wouldn't forgive. Young man, I was just on the verge of being very peeved with you... - being late at one of my receptions. - My humblest apology. I'm not as forgiving as your mother. Well, you better fight my battles for me mother, excuse me.. Thanks Lowell. I don't know what to say... except that I love Barry and I'll do my best to make him happy. You couldn't said anything any better my dear. - This is Mrs. Peyton. - I hope you'll be very happy my dear. Thank you. Well... I think our friends should learn the news. Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Corvall would like to say something. Mrs. Peyton has given me permission to announce... the marriage of miss Brenda Ballard to my son. Paris darling... we'll have a magnificent garret looking out on some beautiful chimneys. I'll hate to leave Washington. Nonsense, you know it's too bad they still don't wear knee breeches. - I'd dazzle them. - You will anyhow. I'm afraid I'll have to leave that up to you darling. - How did you get in? - By invitation. I assure you my dear, my credentials are as good as yours. Excellent match. Quite brilliant. In fact, you seem to have settled yourself so well... that I hate to remind you what you're really here for. What is it you want? I want you to go to work my dear. Second section of the industrial mobilization plan is been completed. - I want you to get it for me. - How? Your husband may have access to it. If not, you will meet friends of his who will help you. - How soon do you need it? - As soon as you can get it. Where shall I get in touch with you? You are most fortunate my dear Brenda... being able to combine business with pleasure. - Oh, I beg your pardon. - Oh, not at all, I should beg yours... For having lured your charming wife away for a little chat about old times. This is Mr. Muller, we used to know each other in Vienna. Yes, old friend. In fact, a very dear friend. Well, we'll doubtless meet again. I hope so. - Who was that? Some newspaperman? - Yes. - Oh, what's the matter? - Nothing darling. Well then I beg to remind you Mrs. Corvall, that this is my dance. Already? Don't like the way you say that, you forget that I'm a very remarkable dancer. You are darling, you are. Brenda? What is it darling? Barry... Remember on the boat when I tried to tell you something? Yes. You said that yesterday had swallowed up the thing that I was afraid of... and that all the tomorrows belonged to us. - Why do you mention that now? - Because yesterday's caught up with me. There aren't going to be any more tomorrow's for us Barry. Has that got anything to do with that newspaperman, that Muller? Yes, only he's not a newspaperman. His business is to collect military information... and sell it to the highest bidder. What he want from you? He wanted the details of an Industrial Mobilization Plan. Or some such thing. Oh, that's a pretty big order. Why did he come to you? Oh Barry... More than anything else in this world, I want you to understand. Please try Barry. Please try to understand what it means to a girl to be on her own in a strange country. Without money, without friends, without even enough to eat sometimes. And always hounded by landlords. Even waiters in cheap restaurants, can you understand that Barry? I think I can. Then can you see how that girl could have got so desperate... so tired, so sick, so weary... so utterly desperate that she'd take the first job she could get... without realizing what it meant. Without even stopping to think that she was working for spies? What kind of a hold have they got on you Brenda? - How much does Muller know? - Everything. The passport that I presented to you in Tangier was forged, he gave it to me. - There was an agreement. - Naturally. But I never intended to go through with it Barry, you must believe that. I'd quit, I thought I was through with them. And then in Morocco, when all that trouble broke out, I was recognized. The police took my papers away from me. Oh, I had to get out of there. I was afraid, I was desperate, I'd seen death all around me. Well, I had agreed to anything just to come home. And I don't regret that part of it Barry. All I regret is that I met you... that I didn't have the courage to tell you. But you offered me the only happiness that I'd ever known. - Oh, I tried to tell you but... - But I wouldn't let you, would I? Please forgive me Barry, I love you so much. Everything is all mixed up. Suddenly the world is turned upside down. But there's one thing it's right. Makes me very humble and grateful, your love Brenda. - Grateful? After what I've done to you? - You haven't done anything. Things have been done to you. Now, want you to tell me all you know about Muller and his crowd... and I want ask you a great favor. I want you to come with me to the State Department. But Barry, when they find out about me, the passport? We have an obligation that's a little more important than you or me Brenda. When that's fulfilled, nothing can spoil our tomorrows. They'll still be ours. I don't know why you should bother to send for me gentlemen... but I have no objection at all to answering your questions. - Won't you be seated? - Do you mind if I smoke? - What is your name? - Karl Muller. - What's your profession? - Journalist. - For what papers do you work? - The Central European News Syndicate. But you have contacts with certain newspapers over here, have you not? I send them European news and in return they pass on American news. From the continental papers. You talked to Mrs. Corvall at my home last Wednesday evening. I did. Did you tell her that you were interested in the most recent details of... the United States Industrial Mobilization plan? - Certainly. - Why? Well, it is news, is it not? Why did you imagine that she could tell you anything about it? Mrs. Corvall and I had met in Europe. As a matter of fact, we knew each other fairly well. So naturally, when I heard she had married a young man in the foreign service... I thought I might use her as an occasional source of information. We journalists do not miss any chances, you know. Did you suggest that Mrs. Corvall should obtain his knowledge from her husband? No, I did not suggest it but it was naturally what occurred to me. We also find your office to be the fountainhead of a flood of.. Poisonous propaganda constantly being sent out to numerous publications in this country. Flood of poisonous propaganda? - I don't understand. - This originate in your office? Certainly. But I would hardly call it propaganda. Merely items of foreign news sent out to our subscribing papers in this country. Mr. Muller, by your actions, by your writings these articles... you make very plain your dislike for our American institution. You leave no doubts to what you think of our system of democracy. Is it not true that you are opposed to our system of democracy? Since you insist on obtaining my opinion, it is true. - Then why do you stay here? - Why shouldn't I? I have my work. And under a democratic system such as yours... I am perfectly entitled to preach against democracy if I wish. Free speech, after all, is one of your country's greatest boasts. Free speech yes, but not treason. You're not a journalist, you're a spy. Is that what your wife said I was? But have you Mr. Corvall, ever asked yourself what she is? I did not wish to mention this Mr. Corvall. Considerations of chivalry would've inclined me to preserve as long as possible... the blissful innocence of a newly married husband about his wife's past. But her own statement compels me to defend myself in the only way possible... by telling you the simple truth. It is your wife who is a spy. Brenda, as she was generally known to her acquaintances, was always a clever girl. It was a brilliant idea to stage a faint to attract your attention at the legation. And then to cross here on a forged passport. I really must apologize for inflicting such shocks to your innocence Mr. Corvall, but... On the contrary, you're telling me nothing I didn't already know. Then if you'll excuse me gentlemen, I have an appointment. Or do I understand that there's a charge on which you're detaining me? - Are you an American citizen Mr. Muller? - No. - Then unfortunately that will be all. - Thank you gentlemen. Well, gentlemen, I think there's nothing more to detain us. But I should like you to call at my office tomorrow morning Mr. Corvall. I think I know what you have to say to me and I'd rather you said it now. I think tomorrow would be better. You going to ask me to resign. I'll save you the trouble. Please accept my resignation now. As you wish. But Barry hasn't done anything wrong, they can't punish him for something that I did. In diplomacy Brenda, a mistake is as blame worthy as a crime. And his mistake was me. From the viewpoint of the State Department, yes. But don't misunderstand me. I'm not condemning you dear. Diplomats' wives are guilty the moment there's a slightest whisper around them. And what's more, their guilt infects their husbands. Mrs. Corvall, all I ever wanted was to make Barry happy... and the dowry I brought to him was scandal and disgrace. - Oh, don't blame yourself too much dear. - I do blame myself. If I'd had the courage, I could've spared him this. Maybe it's not too late. Barry can get an annulment, can't he? I could disappear, that would clear the slate for him. If I went away, if nothing was ever heard of me again. You love Barry very much, don't you? I think he feels the same way about you. You think he'd be happy if you went away? Barry will never be happy without his career. The least I can do is give that back to him. I'm afraid you can't. - I'm afraid Barry's career ended today. - Whose career is ended? Barry, they didn't ask for your resignation? - Of course they did and I gave it to them. - But Muller... I've just discovered for the second time in a generation that... this country has no laws for men like Muller. But that's ridiculous. They release him and punish you. It's a case of the innocent bystander being shot while the bandit goes free darling. Then your career is ended. There's that word again. Say, what is a career anyway? Is it a title, a name on your office door, the medals you wear, or the work you do? What work is there left for you to do dear? I don't know. I haven't had time to think it over yet. But it's got a lot to do with Muller and his crowd. Yes Barry, I know how you feel but what can you do now? What I'd like to do is explode one firecracker under our congressional ostrich. Wake him up to the danger of these saboteurs before they do it with bombs. - But how? - Well, I don't know. I might have to go to Europe looking for powder. You know, just a little informal visit, alone with no particular plan and a lot of hope. But not alone Barry, with me. And maybe with a plan. Because I know the people that Muller worked for and I'm sure I can help you. I'm sorry darling, but this is my party and you're not invited. Barry, when I first told you about Muller... you said that we had an obligation that was greater than either of us, remember? I can see I'm going to have a lot of trouble with Brenda mother. Would you take her into the other room and explain... to her what every young bride should know, not to argue with her husband... not to be sticking her pretty nose into things that don't concern her? I don't know what all this will lead to and I'm afraid for both of you... but I'm on Brenda's side this time, I know how she feels... and I think she's a right to be heard. All right, but before you start Brenda, I just want to tell you one thing... the answer is still no. As we see it, our key man is the Paul Strawn Brenda met in Tangier. Our first job is to locate him and then... Well, from then on we need a lot of luck. And if we succeed, we may be able to convince congress... of the real danger of these enemy agents. They'll have a clear picture of the whole vicious system, facts, names... Exactly how hundreds of these saboteurs are planning on attacking the United States. Barry... as an official of the State Department, I don't even know what you're talking about. In fact, you didn't even come here tonight. But if I had any official knowledge of your plans, it would be my duty to tell you that if you're apprehended... the department will give you no aid nor protection. Your status will be that of unauthorized... and independent agents. And I don't have to tell you that in some countries such agents are beheaded. Yes, I've considered that. I know I'm not within throwing distance of being a hero. But still there are cases... where the job to be done is more important than the risk involved. That, of course, is speaking entirely for myself, as far as it concerns Brenda... Why didn't you stay out of this? It's a long story darling. When I was a little girl I always wanted to play with firecrackers... and they wouldn't let me. Now that I've got the chance, nothing can stop me. - There's a wife for you. - I agree, there is a wife for you. Mrs. Corvall, you came into our life so abruptly that I haven't had an opportunity... to claim a privilege that is mine, as an old friend of the family. So, just to keep the record straight, may I claim it now? That's unofficial, of course. You know, Geneva is a beautiful city. It's too bad they've to have people like Strawn to dirty it up. - How do I look? - Look very wicked. - That's the idea, isn't it? - No, I don't like the idea. I'm tired of it, I'm going with you. Barry, you can't, this is our one way that we have of getting in touch with Strawn. It's our one chance, we got to do it just the way we planned. Oh, all right. Half past, he's nearly always there by 8 o'clock, I got to go. Well, good luck darling. If you get in any trouble, just sing out. - I'll be somewhere in the neighborhood. - For heaven's sake Barry, keep out of sight. I will, but you just sing out. Bye darling. Mrs. Corvall. - How do you do? - How do you do? Oh, I said it first. So you're in Geneva again. - And Mr. Corvall? - Why you want to know? Curiosity. I heard about his unfortunate experience. - That was too bad. - He thinks so. You know... you really should not have tried to dupe our friend. - He is a man of very high intelligence. - Listen, if you're talking about Muller... high intelligence? I have my apartment upstairs, perhaps we can talk there in greater privacy. Privacy? I don't want any privacy. But perhaps you do. As a result, I had to make a clean breast of everything... in order to protect my own interests. Oh I see. Naturally, your own interests came first. - Naturally. - Well, at least you're frank. But instead of advancing my interests I merely placed them on an insecure basis. Instead of rewarding my husband for exposing Muller, his government discharged him. So I understand. And now your husband blames you? On the contrary, he blames his government. For not considering me the patriot he thinks I am. Are you inferring that he is in error in that supposition? Having been a woman without a country for so many years... patriotism is a luxury I can't afford, Herr Strawn. And your husband? Is he solvent enough to afford the luxury? Perhaps, if he weren't married to me. He happens to love me very much and I'm a trifle expensive. And you propose to improve your financial status through my organization? Why not? My husband has friends, contacts. Here, for instance. - These items are already known to us. - These are samples Herr Strawn. You are very clever madame, but forgive me if I seem to doubt your loyalty. My loyalty is not the sale Herr Strawn, my stock in trade is information, facts. I propose to sell it on the highest market, you've been offered first bid. That was well stated madame. Now, if you will excuse me, I have an appointment. It is quite possible my dear Mrs. Corvall, that you may hear from us. After you've made an investigation, of course. I reiterate madame, you are very clever. Indulging in several light flirtations.. A fact which has caused many quarrels between the two. Corvall appears extremely in love with his wife and except when in a fit of jealousy... completely dominated by her. They have had no visitors except Mr. Lowell Warrington... an undersecretary at the United States consulate... with whom Corvall seems on the friendliest terms. We understand they were classmates in Washington. Their mail is light, contains no official letters. There have been no long distance calls placed since we began the investigation, And only a few local calls, those to the consulate being all to Warrington. Corvall is traveling on a letter of credit which amounts to slightly less... than 5,000 Swiss francs. You believe him to be an emotionally unstable young man? Infatuated with this woman. And the woman is his own wife? - Extraordinary. - She is beautiful? - Extremely. - I'll accept your opinion. However, you will take every precaution. You will meet this woman, see to it that Corvall is also occupied at that time. Once they're so engaged, you will search their apartment thoroughly... and arrange for their constant surveillance. When you've completed these arrangements, you will telephone Strawn. So far, our experts have been unable to break it. We know it is not a machine code and we believe it's one not often used. Barry would know. He might know the type but no man could carry such a complicated formula in his head. This is not the original document, of course. Just a copy of a few of the repeated symbols. However, if he could get the key for them an expert cryptographer could break the rest. A few minutes alone with the manual, if the consulate has one. - Can that be managed? - I think so. - And the terms, our usual arrangement? - Very well. Come in. - You're wanted on the telephone sir. - Excuse me. The apartment has been investigated, nothing of interest found. - The other arrangements have been completed. - Good. Remember, this time there can be no excuses. One step in the wrong direction for either you or Corvall will bring instant disaster. I'm not likely to forget that. - What on earth kept you so long? - Sorry darling, I met some friends. - Champagne cocktail please. - Yes madame. A code they want broken. Barry, where you've been keeping yourself? I've called you a dozen times. Well, I haven't been answering the phone lately. - Been sick? - Well, you might call it that. Come on in. There isn't anything wrong with you that 2 fingers of this won't cure. Oh no thanks Lowell, I... I've tried that, doesn't work. Don't let it get you down Barry. There are a lot of things to do besides being in the service. Well, it isn't losing my job in the service that got me down, It's just... Well, when this whole thing came up there was one thing we all took for granted. - That was Brenda's sincerity. - Anyone with a grain of sense can see that. Well, I'm not so sure now. - Are you crazy? - Well, I got a good start. It's enough to drive anyone crazy the way she's been acting lately. Mysterious engagements with strange men, phone calls day and night she won't explain. I tried to believe there was an innocent explanation for it, until... Well, until I found this among her things. - Code, eh? - Can you recognize it? - Looks a little like Interdepartmental 29C. - Yes, that's what I thought. But I know enough about 29C to know it isn't that, but it is familiar. It does look suspicious. If that's one of our codes, you can tell me in 2 seconds. Do it for me, will you Lowell? I want to know. Want to come code room with me? You've forgotten the rules, haven't you? It's right, somehow I can't get the idea of your not being in the service. Neither can I. Hurry it up, will you Lowell? Brenda is calling for me in just a few minutes. Right. - I'm sorry Barry, it's our code all right. - Are you sure? Look for yourself. That word decoded is airplane. That one is conversion. Seems that someone has snaffled a fairly important message. Couldn't be any mistake, could there? The only mistake seems to be the one you made by marrying a pretty... girl who fainted in your consulate one day in Tangier. And he tricked Warrington into giving him the key to the code... - without Warrington suspecting a thing. - Good. Hello Mrs. Corvall, your husband is in with Mr. Warrington. Shall I tell him you're here? Thanks, but don't bother him, I'll wait here. All right. I know it's tough Barry, but you've got to face it. Beside, you won't be filing that report. I will. This is unofficial Lowell, I came to you as a friend. You haven't any right to file that report unless I ask you to. All right. She may have some explanation, at least I owe her the right to clear herself. - Watch your step Barry. - Thank you Lowell. - Well, it worked but I'm not proud of it. - Barry, the porter, did you notice? - Why? - I've seen him somewhere before. He recognized me too, I think he's worked for Strawn in Paris. Don't worry, we may need him. Hello PA? Is Donald Garrett in yet? Good, let me speak to him please. Hello, Garrett speaking. Oh, hello, Barry. Hello Don, when did you get in? Good, what's the condition? Bad, as usual, looks like war this time, we'll know something by tonight. Broadcast goes on in a few minutes. - What's new with you? - Well, I made contact, that's about all. Look, I'm staying at the Palace, but don't come here and don't call. Yeah, I got an idea I'm a goldfish, I'll get in touch with you. Ok, good luck. Berlin broadcast. Then by shortwave to the United States and Canada, broadcasting from the press-room... of the Pan American Press Bureau in Geneva, Switzerland. And now Mr. Donald Garrett, world famous correspondent... will give you his interpretation of today's dramatic events. Mr. Garrett. Throughout Europe tonight, the voices of hate are still crying... and Europe's war of nerves, this time more than ever before... seem about to blast into a real war... a war of Cannon and warplanes and the blood of men. If it does start, we, your American correspondents... will attempt to give you the authentic reports of news as it happens. But already in London, Paris, Berlin... in almost every capital in Europe, plans are completed for a lid tight censorship. Tonight, in what may very well be the last uncensored broadcast... I want to forewarn you the people of America not to believe everything you will hear... until there is official confirmation. Sift the accounts, study the sources... and look to your American correspondents who will try to bring you the truth. And above all, let the hatreds of Europe remain in Europe. Keep them out of our country. Remember that America should be neutral. Now for the summaries of the events of the past 12 hours. Yes. Yes, it will be comparatively simple to decode from these notes. - Quite satisfactory madame. - Thank you. This was the understanding, I believe. - Yes, thank you. - That will be all madame. Is no other way I can be of service? Not for the present madame but we shall be in constant touch with you. One can understand the young man's infatuation with her. We shall have no further use for her. Good night madame. Leave your hats and coats here gentlemen, now this way. Come in gentlemen. This graph represents the working program of the United States industrial plan... first and second sections. The chief agent in each zone is represented by a large black circle... and subordinate agents by smaller circles. You can see gentlemen, that we have infiltrated into every vital industrial... nerve center in the United States. The organization is in fact a combat secret service. With a war potential more destructively effective than a division of shock troops. - This has all been completed? - Yes, your excellency. Impossible, no American could be that stupid. There have been no secret arrests, no counter-checks. Whether they are stupid or merely indifferent, I don't know. That's something difficult for us to understand. But the fact remains that no effective counterespionage measures... have been able to get through their congress. Incredible, this seeming indifference has not affected your vigilance? No, your excellency. Your instructions have been carried out to the letter. No agent knows more than one or two others. Any score of them could be arrested. Would not affect the organization nor would it lead to us. There is only one record, known only to me, you may be sure that it's safe. These agents have been carefully selected? - You can guarantee their effectiveness? - Yes, your excellency. Should there be reason to order it, the war industries will be destroyed first. Transportation lines crippled, food supplies poisoned or contaminated beyond salvage. Reservoirs polluted. Overnight, the nation will be in chaos, helpless... the civilian population in terror and confusion. Very good Rader, you will arrange your cover. Stand by for further orders which may come any day. Very good your excellency. - Good night gentlemen. - Good night. I know who they are, everyone at the head of the ring- Rader, Strawn, Decker, Struegel at the consulate. But that's no better than knowing Muller in Washington. What I got to get is proof-documentary evidence for a report to congress. If they only could see what I saw. Why, even the maps they used tonight might've been enough. But I got to get names and addresses of those agents... records of their payment, their stations. They told Rader he might get orders within a few days? - Yes. - Yeah? We'll know by then, war or peace. And if it's war, they'll tack off and you won't stand a chance. I know, but I got to take that gamble. Say, can you charter a plane through this office, have it ready day and night? - Sure, anything else you want to tell me? - No, that's all you can do to help. Ok, the plane will be there and good luck. If anything happens I'll write you a fine obituary. Thanks Don. Well, it's getting near the zero hour darling. I know, it ought to be a lovely firecracker Barry. - If I'd known, if I could have foreseen... - it's too late to talk about that now. Beside, nothing is going to happen to me. And if there weren't a man sitting over there who seems to be watching us, I'd lean over and kiss you in a very public manner. - Shall I leave first? - Please. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - What you find out? - Quite a lot. So did I, I did some investigating on my own hook. Sorry to hear that. - But in a thing of this importance... - Lowel, we can talk about that later. The important thing now is that I find out the gang she's working with. - Ever hear of the world peace brotherhood? - Yeah. Well, that's their headquarters and their boss is Dr. Anton Rader. I've also heard that Dr. Rader may be called away at any moment. - We couldn't risk that. - What you want me to do? Notify the Swiss police that Rader's activities... are a violation of the country's neutrality laws. Well madame, since you insist on seeing me, I hope your business is of importance. Dr. Rader, I've just found out something. My husband is working against you. Explain yourself madame. He's working for the US government, has been ever since we left Washington. His only reason for being here is to smash the organization. Oh, I didn't know, I didn't know anything about it. What makes you think this? Oh, it isn't something I think, I know. I overheard a conversation between him and one of the men at the consulate. What kind of a trick is this? You've got to believe me... and you've got to believe that I had nothing to do with it. Yes? Corvall is here at the legation now. - With Warrington. - Yes? Very well, stay at your post. Struegel. You're under arrest. Pay no attention to anything I've said and above all, don't do anything. What? Why? I'll tell you later, in the meantime keep our friend here locked up. Have this place evacuated at once. Notify all agents in Geneva to destroy... everything they have that may be incriminating. Their future orders will come through the established cover addresses. Yes doctor. Would seem that you told the truth, our thanks madame. You must take me with you, you can't leave me here. Yes, might dangerous to leave you behind. We shall see, Corvall undoubtedly has confederates. Of course he has, he couldn't find out everything he has without help. That's true. The airports, the railways, the borders all might be watched. But if they have police there, why don't they come here? It's not me they want, it's what I shall carry with me. The point is how to get out of Geneva. We can drive to Nyon and catch the Strasbourg express there. Yes... but since you suggest it, that's the very last thing I shall do madame. Dr. Rader, haven't I proved you can trust me by coming here as soon as I found out? Possibly, but one of the tricks of hunting is to flush the quarry from their cover. Such an idea might've occurred to you and your husband. We shall use your idea, the station will not be Nyon nor the train the Strasbourg express. You will come with me. If you've told the truth, you'll be safe. If not, you'll be a very charming hostage. 120 kilometers, we have to stop at 4 - 2 - 7. - Yes, we have time, is your car ready? - Yes doctor. You will follow us as usual, this way madame. I followed them here to Fribourg, where they caught the express. I see, what did you say about Corvall? Was he hurt? Where? The world peace headquarters. All right. - What? - Barry, are you hurt? No, no, but they got away and Brenda is with them. - Yes I know, they took the Fribourg express. - Why you know that? I told you I was doing some investigating on my own, I had a man trailing Brenda. - No? Lowell, you're a wonder. - Hey, where you going? - I'm going to take your car. - Hey, wait a minute. Plane is all warmed up and waiting, good luck Barry. Thanks Don. - Wait, you got a map? - Yes, is right here. - Where is the Fribourg express go through? - Oh, it goes through here. Is there a landing field in Munchenstein? - Yes, there's a small one there. - What about Basil? - Oh, there's an emergency field there. - Good. You drop me at Munchenstein and go on to Basil, I'll pick you up there later. . Right. One more stop before the border. - Are you nervous? - No. You must've had a very poor opinion of our intelligence... if you thought we were taken in by you. Not for one moment Mrs. Corvall. You thought you were very clever, didn't you? We know America has no counterespionage. In a few minutes, we shall be in another country and then... Well, we have ways of dealing with people like you. Not very nice ways, but they're surprisingly effective. - Munchenstein. - Now, here we are. Passport examination. Come in. - Don't move Rader. - Barry. - Well, this is a surprise. - Stand up. You're a very clever man Mr. Corvall. Unfortunately, your cleverness is of very little consequence. We're on the borders of my country. This car is full of our soldiers. I've only to cause an alarm. - Dr. Rader. - Doctor Doctor. Search the train. - Anybody pass through here? - Yes sir, a man and a woman. Come on, let's make it. Obviously, by plane. Notify our agents in Geneva, Bern, Paris, Prague, London. All capitals to watch the airports. Men must be placed in all United States embassies and legations. Corvall must be stopped at any cost, very well. All Britain is preparing for war. Antiaircraft and coastal defense forces have been... called out and every man and woman in the British isles... is been warned to get a gas mask. In Hyde park and other green spaces we find people digging trenches. For the past week, Americans have been crowding every steamship leaving the country. Tonight, the Queen Mary sails, a last ship to leave England. We'll make it, we've got to. Well, there it is Barry... everything we've been hoping and fighting for, summed up in a headline. You helped write the headline and you helped forge the weapon the service so badly needed. And yet the service can't show its gratitude. Ironic, isn't it? That your career should bear fruit only when you became a private citizen? Being a private citizen is quite a career in itself, isn't it sir? Yes indeed and I think your father would've thought so too. - Don't you Mrs. Corvall? - Yes. And he would've known something I've just begun to understand... A career isn't the uniform you wear or the medals you win. It's the work you do. I know mother... the work is just beginning and I'll be happy to help in it if I can, one way or another. We'll leave the medals to the next Barry Corvall.
