Subtitle by blademaster. Improved by Rogu. Huh? My coaster is folded. Was it like that from the start? "Get out of here, this area is too dangerous." SHU... Shu! A man resembling Shuichi Akai was spotted in this department store. I must see this so-called ghost with my own eyes. No, Shu! Stay inside! They're waiting for you! Shu! Forgive me. Did you hurt yourself? The wrongs, however, are shared. It's 50/50. Yes... There he is! He's here! Ghost spotted! He's in front of the entrance. You have to see it from your car. Shuichi Akai. My name is Shuichi Akai, An FBI agent. I was raised in England, to investigate my odd inmcident I was forced me to flee and live in Japan. To unravel the mystery of my father's disappearance, I took an American citizenship and then I joined the FBI. I infiltrated the organization responsible for his death under the code name "Rye". From there, I continued my investigation. But one mistake cost me my cover. Who could believe all this? I'm as surprised as you are. Did you really think you were coming to your end? He died. That night at Raiha Pass, Shuichi was shot in the head. The Akai family. A mysterious family, and yet. It is clear that his enemies are also mine, a known secret society under the name Black Organization. This family is at the center of a danger who knows no boundaries. On that day, a ghost surfaced. Shu! I'm so happy I'm shaking. If he is still alive, it allows me to kill him again. What's going on? You're in a good hurry. Mrs. Jodie! Don't tell me you're looking the same person as me, right? Ghost spotted! Hurry to confirm the target, Gin! Shuichi Akai. Vermouth. Do you think he's dead? Yes, but the boss prefers to make sure. He doesn't really like take tweezers. Make a decision! Do I have to shoot, yes or no? Make up your mind! He saw me... I can't believe it! He saw me! He saw me and he smiled! Do I do it or not? Tell me! Gin, something's going on. Customers are rush inside the building. Where is he? Where did he go? We're retiring. Pass the message to Korn. Why? Explain yourself, Gin! Gin. He got us right. This one doesn't change. What? Who are you talking about? You were right. I would also like that it only exists in books, Detectives like Sherlock Holmes. This is how the ghost attack could be avoided on the wire. It is by pure chance that we met this person. You're invincible, Ran! You outright won the regional karate tournament! So, as promised, I'll treat you to the pastry buffet so you can get stronger. I will devour it all to be even stronger! You're gonna get fat, aren't you? A pervert! I'm holding a pervert! No, I'm not. Don't lie! You just touched my ass! - Ran, fix that. - All right. Expect. Is he as strong as Ran? I have to avoid it! In any case, he knows the Jeet Kune Do as well. As expected of the Kanto champion. He's scary. You're good. Ran. Step aside, Sonoko. This pervert is strong. Let me clarify the situation! I didn't. He's not a pervert. I've seen it all. He caught the man who touched your ass. And you just have it mistaken for the culprit. This is the culprit. I'm sorry! Forgive me! Don't come back, you fool! Excuse me, I attacked you without making sure it was you. Don't worry. At least the misunderstanding is dispelled. He's pretty cute. And I like girls like you, so I forgive you. Did I hear that right now? I'm the one who was targeted by the pervert though! I'm kidding. Where are you going? At the Haido hotel. What a coincidence, I'm going there too. Really? Is that true? Be careful of what you say. By the way, thank you, kid. You're welcome. So we made way to the hotel together. But once we arrived. one victim was lying on the ground. Who's up there? I saw a weird shadow on the roof! Shoes on a garment? Is it suicide? No. It was disguised as suicide. Two of us understood it. It's murder. Not true. Who would have believed it? Conan? He was a detective like me. The culprit is none other than old Hirukawa. Is he as good as I am? But when he wanted prove his theory. What? What does that mean? The dummy should normally be projected. Something was missing. I thought I found it. What a pity. The paint cans. The culprit used both pots painting near the window, in order to project the victim. That voice... Is that you, Shinichi? Yes. I called my brother and he told me that everything was clear. Shinichi Kudo? After that, I used my bow tie voice transformer. and I explained the trick. The case was resolved in no time. All right, sit down. I have good news for you. You have a new classmate. This is Masumi Sera. Masumi Sera? A transfer student? She's wearing a skirt! Was it a girl? My name is Masumi Sera. Nice to meet you! I was as surprised as the others. Then comes the second son. I met this unusual individual in a place that was just as much. Excuse me for the delay. It took you a while. Hey. What is it? Hey. Don't open it as long as I don't have the seven. What are you saying? I'll notify you in due course. Promise me. Yumi? Yumi? Oh, Yumi! Officer Yumi Miyamoto! Don't sleep on patrol. By the way, what does that mean, "have the seven"? Did I say that? Yes, while sleeping. You were asking how long will it take. I was dreaming about my ex. I wanted to leave him after I joined the police, and he handed me an envelope saying wait till he gets the seven. But what does it refer to? Who knows? Probably something dumb. Did he have a boat? Maybe he wanted conquer the seven oceans: the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, the South Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean. Conan. Was he tanned? No, it was white as a cloth. He often went out, without looking like he have a stable job. But why am I talking to you about this? Honestly. It's Sakurako. Hello? I'm on patrol right now. What? Is someone dead? Sakurako! Naeko! It doesn't look like prima facie to a murder. What is that note at his feet? A farewell letter written from his hand. With the letter at his feet, everything suggested suicide. 7 left, 2 right, then 3 left. I have a very good memory. The best in Japan... No, in the world. Wait! Yes? Who is it? Yumi honey! "Yumi honey"? Do you know him? Yes. It's my ex. This dodgy looking neighbor is Shukichi Haneda. But what is your boyfriend doing here? First of all, it's my ex, and he's here because he knows the code of the box in which there were double the keys. You were at home in the hour of drama? No, I was outside. Barely home, the police came ringing. Where were you and what were you doing? Well. Come on, answer! I can't say. Do you understand your situation? You're a murder suspect! Answer quickly, or we'll think you're guilty! It's okay, Yumi, honey. After all. This case is solved. Thanks to the incredible memory of Shukichi and through work little Detectives, the truth broke quickly on this case. This is not the only truth that broke out. Look. Congratulations on your fourth title, Taiko Meijin! He's the great shogi player! My mother is a fan of him! What is it to do with Shukichi? Take a good look. This is his true identity. My opponent almost got me right. I recognize this hair in battle! Is that Shukichi? The shogi Taiko Meijin player was none other than Shukichi Haneda. I see. He was inspired by the resemblance in his name with Hideyoshi Hashiba. Yes. The day of murder, he played the tournament qualifiers. He said nothing, because he still wants hide from Yumi that he plays shogi. Why? It is ultra renowned! What meant by having the seven, then? As we talk about shogi, it's obvious. A FEW YEARS EARLIER I did it, Yumi honey! I finally became a grand master! Yumi honey! You're late! Excuse me, the game dragged on. You were playing a game? Uh... It's a game, certainly. To tell you everything. - Rather, look at this article! - An article? The Yokozuma Sumo wrestler won in a row the six tournaments of the year! It's amazing, isn't it? He never lost in a year! Any woman would feel like a queen alongside such a king! But don't worry, I don't expect that from you. Kio, Osho, Oza, Kisei, Oi, Ryu. Meijin! I'd have the seven shogi titles! Shhukichi's a celebrity? Yes! In reality. Knowing him, he is famous in fishing or something. I wouldn't be surprised. Yumi honey was not really interested in the truth. And the last member. Who is that girl? You have other passions than martial arts? Actually, I fell in the Jeet Kune Do very young. One of my brothers sometimes sent me videos of him, and I passed all my time imitating his gestures. There was also a dojo next to my house. But in college, and during my stay in the United States, I also played other sports. I often watched competitions with my mother. I also saw immediately that you were good at football, Conan. Thanks. Is your mother still living in the United States? Yes. So I live alone in a hotel room since I got back. I could have slept well at my other brother who lives here, but he refused. I have no other relatives to rely on. If she only has two brothers and no other parents. So who is this girl who looks like him on his phone? Is your hotel near here? Yes. Can we go for a walk? I'd like to see your room, too. If you want. We went to the hotel where Masumi was staying, but a murder fell on our arms. Ma'am? Are you all right? Ma'am? The lower floor! Hey, wait! Wait for me, Ran! Ma'am! Answer me! Are you all right? Mrs. Minazuki! She has marks on her neck. Maybe a rope. We see that she tried to resist in the face of his aggressor. She was strangled. Death dates back two to three hours. Chiaki! What happened ? What is she doing on the ground? She was killed. Someone strangled her. But why? It might have something to do with the fax. We received a fax this morning. "If you don't fire the assistant, she'll pay for it. Why am I learning this now? Couldn't you have told me earlier? While she was going through this, I was quietly writing my romance novel! I see. The culprit. is him. Are you done soon? Get out of my room now. Investigate the mysterious fax! It is obvious that the culprit is the one who sent this! If you want to keep searching, you have to explain to me why! How could I have left and come back to my room at the time of the murder? You didn't need it. You brought the victim, and you killed her right here. Masumi and me were then able to confuse the culprit and demonstrate his plan, not forgetting to reveal the feelings of the victim. So... Oh no. Everything was clear. I don't believe it. But the mystery remains. Who is the girl in the picture? It's strange. Are you all right? No, it's nothing! A hidden microphone. It's the same as his glasses. That was risky. I've never seen one. Judging by the size of the battery, its autonomy must be low. A microphone so small but so powerful. It awakens my curiosity. So you find it interesting? We can't still trust him, but if he came to ask you about me, answer him this. "This is my exiled sister." I never thought that the identity from this girl hides in my memory. And this memory returned as a result from a case that had no connection. Shall we eat something? I know a great ramen restaurant. Hello? It's me. I'm eating with Ran and my friends tonight. Tell the chief not to count me for the gourmet meal, okay? You'd rather have ramen than this? I always dreamed of eating ramens with my friends after school! A hell of a dream for a princess. I promise you this is a killing. These ramens are good to die for! RAMENS GOOD TO DIE FOR And here are your ramens from the Judge of the Underworld! It looks excellent! It's too good! These ramens are really delicious! - I agree! - Right? So, you made up your mind? You want to have stir-fried rice again what about ravioli to take away, Marie? My name is Masumi, not Marie! But I will, yes. It works. You're gonna eat stir-fried rice and ravioli, in addition to ramens? You're gonna get fat. No, no, it's for breakfast. The dishes here are good, even cold. Tell me, it wouldn't be for someone who's hiding in your room? So? Do you have any news? Anything new? What are you doing here, Yumi and Naeko? Huh, Ran? And you too, Conan? Are you pursuing a murderer? All alone? Yes. Last week, we used to patrol the neighborhood. And we fell nose to nose with a shady individual. Hey, what are you doing? Wait! I'm running after him. Go around with the car! - We're gonna take him in a pincer! - All right! I quickly went around with the car, but Yumi is the only one to have appeared. Local shopkeepers held a meeting, the storefronts were extinct and the deserted streets. Hence our conclusion. The culprit has entered this restaurant! According to them, one of the restaurant's three customers was the murderer. You lose your charm pulling your head like that. Say. I don't want to be indiscreet, but. Do you know each other? She often came in my old restaurant, alongside his bespectacled darling. He's talking about Shukichi Haneda. It's really weird. Why men with glasses love ramen so much? My brother has glasses and he is also a big fan of ramens. See? And it's 100% safe to say if they also have an unshaven beard. This is the case with my brother! It's a pity, because once shaved and well dressed, he is very handsome. But he hangs out in a tracksuit. I know something about it. While he's so smart. Yes, and he has a phenomenal memory. He memorizes a number phone in an instant. He even often says: "I have the best memory in Japan. "No, in the world. Here? I think there was another customer that day. Another customer? At the same time? It was your boyfriend, Yumi. These ramens are a pure delight! What? Was Shukichi there? Don't you want to call him? He has an incredible memory, right? First taken for a suspect, Shukichi was a great help. He was making a noise weird every step. Of the kind "tac-tac". "Clack-clack" every step? Ah, "tac-tac," sorry. Tac-tac? I know! With the help of Masumi. the culprit was found. A warrant has just been signed. So you're under arrest. Are you from the police? Have you forgotten us? We've met before, though. Miwake Satou. inspector of the first Tokyo police division. Wataru Takagi, from the same division. That's done. Where did Masumi go? She just left. She had to do. What? Is Marie gone? I forgot again to return his handkerchief. Her handkerchief? It must be hers, I think I saw the name "Marie" embroidered on it. This is not "Marie", but "Mary". This handkerchief does not belong to Masumi, but rather to the girl in the photo. Huh? Why did I think that? Mary could also be Masumi's real name. That probably means I've already heard this name somewhere. But where? There's still someone left. Someone surrounded with a mysterious aura. One day, Ai and me have been abducted by kidnappers. Look again and set fire to the building if you can't find them. By chance, the other Little Detectives had been able to hide. And thanks to Mitsuhiko's phone. Hey! The kidnapper was put out of harm's way. Someone's heading here! He's getting closer. This feeling. Oh no! The man who appeared. Subaru? What are you doing here? It was none other than Subaru Okiya, a young student who lives in my home. I was worried that the professor didn't turn on his lights, given the time. I went to his house, and the door was open while there was no one. I found these glasses connected in his lab, and I followed your position to meet you in this building. This wobbly explanation however aroused Ai's suspicions. You go to your neighbor just because his lights are off? It seems rather that you're watching his house. Soon after, the situation grew. What are you doing here? You have nothing to do here. Oh no. You're the type to leak information. Mrs. Jodie, where's Agent Camel? In the parking lot, why? Rikumichi Kusuda? Never heard of it. He was hospitalized here and he disappeared by abandoning a car not far away. You haven't heard anything from from your more experienced colleagues? No. I'm catching on. This information should not be transmitted to those at the bottom of the ladder. What are you saying? I already got all the info. Andre! What are you doing? Stay with me. Tsk. You didn't tell him anything on Rikumichi Kusuda, right? No, of course. I wouldn't say he killed himself with his gun in his car, even if I was tortured. Perfect. Thanks. Finally, it was Shuichi who told me that, before they even sent me here. Jodie? Where are you? Jodie? Here? Jodie? Andre! Jodie. Are you all right? What do you mean? Have you seen T?ru Amuro from the organization? I saw his car leaving the parking lot. You didn't tell him anything confidential? He knows how to make people talk. No, of course. But you've already asked me this question. What are you saying? I just got off! What? But who was the other Jodie then? Mistress of disguise and imitation. And the only one who masters these two arts. Can only be one person. You took a while. I thought you wouldn't come. I did not find her scarf in store. I see. So? What did you learn? You were seeing for Rikumichi Kusuda. He killed himself with his gun. And in his car. I see. Vermouth? It would be Vermouth who pretended to be Jodie? She knew we were here and she set us a trap? Yes. Bourbon and her, we got played right by their hands. But what can Bourbon look for? So, what did you tell him? Well. She wanted info about the spy who had infiltrated here, Rikumichi Kusuda. I told him that he committed suicide in his car. To what will this information serve them? Maybe they were afraid he would talk if he was captured by the FBI. But if he died, they would be relieved. Or there could be another reason. What do you think, Conan? Conan? Conan? What is it? Conan? So? Who is this Rikumichi that you are interested in? He was a simple member of the Organization. He hadn't even been given a code name. We don't care if he killed himself, don't we? If you were to kill yourself with a weapon, how would you do it? Well. I will point the gun to my temple. Exactly. And the impact would be clearly visible in your skull. Even if we burned your body. Doesn't it mean anything to you? Rikumichi has stopped informing us. And we shot in the head and burned another man at the same time. Don't tell me. Right. The great FBI agent. Shuichi Akai. It's impossible. Do you really think he's alive? Yes. At least, if my hypothesis is true. Unfortunately for you, you're wrong. Shuichi's death was confirmed. It's even the Japanese police who confirmed it. And the FBI later acknowledged. I've told you about it before, haven't I? After Kir shot him in the head Raiha, Shuichi burned with the car, and his prints matched those left on the little detective's cell phone. But in this case, how could we take the imprint of a charred body? Well. Shuichi had to burn while keeping his hand in the pocket of his fireproof pants. That's the kind of man he is. He shot me with a shotgun keeping one hand in the pocket. Really? One-handed shotgun shooting? It looks like him. But we can also assume that his fingerprints were placed on the corpse after the body is calcined. If you have so many doubts, watch the video of his execution. You're talking about the video taken by the camera attached to Kir's neck? Yes. We see very well Shuichi took his last breath. What are you waiting for, Kir? Finish him off. His lung is punctured. He's left only about thirty minutes. Aim for the head. Put a bullet in his head. It will definitively put an end to his existence. Understood. And just before she shoots, he told her this: To think it would come to this? I'm as surprised as you are. I'll tell you what I think as an actress. His words came straight from the heart. He was perfectly sincere. He wasn't acting. But he disappointed me. To put into such a huge farce. "To think it would come to this". "To think it would come to this". "To think it would come to this". To think it would come to this? I see. It's obvious. I'll prove my theory to you. You'll have the answers soon. And believe me, you're gonna be open-mouthed. Really? I guess you know where is that famous ghost then? No, not yet. But if I have any leads, I only need one day to find my prey. MORI DETECTIVE AGENCY Conan! When does the Macademys ceremony begins? Huh? Dad, Conan's still not home from school? He called to say to eat without him because he's spending the night at the professor's house. Is that true? I wanted to watch the ceremony with him. What is interesting about an awards ceremony? This year, Shinichi's father is nominated as the best screenwriter! I'm burning with impatience! I understand that you, you are impatient, but how would that interest Conan? You're right. Okay, go prepare the meal instead. I'm starving. To start with the award for best supporting actor. The prize will be awarded by last year's winner, the great Johnny Beep! Yes? I have a delivery. Good evening and nice to meet you, my name is T?ru Amuro. Okay. But. It seems to me that we've met before. I'd like to talk to you. May I come in? Yes, but only you. I am sorry, but your friends will have to stay out. I'm afraid I don't have enough tea cups for them. Don't worry. They like to wait outside. But depending on your answers, they could very well all break into your living room. Raiha Pass? You want to go where Shuichi was killed? Yes. I have the feeling that we can learn something from it. Yes. When Conan learned that the enemy knew the death of Rikumichi Kusuda, he was terrified. There must be something, for sure! Let's move on now at the price of the best scenery. Please, sit down. Thanks. How're you doing? You haven't stopped this year. The artistic direction of SpringWest was grandiose. Are you stressing? I remember that your voice was shaking last year. Here I am again. This is still the case. Do you like mysteries? Yes, you can say that. Then we'll start with that? Well in reality it's a simple exchange of corpses. I see. This is quite common in mysteries. A man received a bullet in the head at the Raiha Pass and his car burned with him. A finger print from his right hand was taken, and she matched to the one that the man had left on a child's phone. So we were able to identify the charred victim. But something is wrong. What then? The fingerprint left on the phone. This man was left-handed, and yet, the imprint left came from his right hand. Don't you think that's strange? Maybe his left hand was taken when he picked up the phone. Or he had no choice and had to grab it with his right hand. For what reason? Because this phone had been picked up previously by another man, and that man was right-handed. Another man? Yes. But the victim grabbed the phone, right? He also had to leave his fingerprints. But if he had decked himself in this eventuality? It is likely that he planned all this, and that he applied something on his fingers. Coated. That's probably it. Shu had to smear his fingers with a transparent liquid. He must have smeared both hands as a precaution. What do you mean? He took Conan's phone, and the plaster allowed him not to leave his fingerprints. That explains why the can slipped out of his hands. Because of the coating, he had a worse grip. So whose fingerprints was on the phone? Not Shu's. These are Rikumichi's, who took the phone before him. So to summarize, The charred corpse found at Raiha pass with a bullet in the head. Yes, it was the body by Rikumichi Kusuda. There are still grey areas, but Shu had to disguise and place the corpse in the car and they exchanged places at the right time. I see. This is a very interesting mystery. How could the man escape? Can you turn off the TV first? This is a serious discussion. I'd like to listen. I always watch the awards show. So? How did he do it? He must have been in cahoots with the woman who shot him. He just had to go up in the woman's car and leave. While not being seen by the one who was watching them a little further. Were they being watched? Yes. And that man saw nothing but fire. After all, this man saw blood squirting from the victim's skull. Blood spurted? It was fake blood. The man who got shot always wore a black cap. And I understand that near here, a professor who creates inventions that pales to the MI6 members. The man had to ask her to hide a pocket of blood under his cap. Nothing hard for him. So while hoping that she just aims, he would have asked the woman to shoot him in the head? No, it was the man who was watching them who gave the order to aim at the head. They expected it. They knew that this man completed his targets in this way. It's hardly believable. It would still mean that Shuichi bet his life on the fact they ordered Rena to kill him. Yes. That wouldn't be surprising. This man is truly amazing. Looks like the hero from a spy novel. But it's someone else who hatched this plan. Using the phone containing the fingerprints. I'll lend you my phone if you want. The idea did not come from Shu. Yes. Another person. But then. Jodie. Uh, so. Good luck. I take this as proof the last words of this man. To think it would come to this? Strange, right? "To think it would come to this?" For me, these are nothing else than the words of an incredulous man. Yes, if we take these words in the strict sense. But if we add a little something. it takes on a whole new meaning. Who could believe. ... that he anticipated all this? Yes, the words that he said at that time are words of admiration of this boy's genius. I see. It's interesting. I'm gonna have to speed up. Suspicious cars are following us. But where was Shuichi and what was he doing all this time? Do you recall anything? Someone with their language tics. His tics. You know, he had one in particular. He said "It's 50/50, it passes or it breaks". Forgive me. Did you hurt yourself? The wrongs, however, are shared. It's 50/50. You should do more attention with the crowd. From there, everything interwoven. After this event at the pass, a mysterious man appeared in the young boy's entourage. Which explains my coming here. I don't know what your connection is with the owner of this house, or even with this boy, but it is obvious that you're here because of him. It was him! I told you about him. The man who got into me in the department store. I'm waiting for a call. My men are pursuing your colleagues. I am thinking that you will not remain indifferent if their lives were at stake. I would still prefer you will have removed the mask before this call. What do you say, Subaru Okiya? Or should I say the FBI agent. Shuichi. Akai. Well, if that's what you want. Thank you. What? Are they blocking with their cars? Hold on, because it will shake! - What are you doing! Chase them! - Yes! That was incredible. But who are these people? Probably the organization. They understood that Shu is alive, and they want to use us to get him out of his hideout. So this is all because I have revealed that Rikumichi committed suicide? I messed up his plan again. Stop rehashing the past! Focus on the road! This is just like two years ago. I ruined it again! I'm sorry, Shuichi! What are you playing? I have a little cough, can I put my mask back on? I don't want to contaminate you. I'm talking about your disguise, not that mask, Shuichi Akai! A disguise? Shuichi Akai? But what are you talking about? Let's move on now at the award for best screenwriter. The personwho will receive this magnificent award is an author of bestselling novels who made his debut in cinema. So I give the award to my friend and author of the Black Baron, Yusaku Kudo. for his work Agent Scarlet! Brilliant! Shinichi's father won the award! They even display it on the headband. Don't you think that's amazing, dad? I don't believe it, he's drooling. Why are these 2 fathers so different? Not good. The car handle keeps pulling right. Why? It must be due to the previous stunt. The tire and rim was damaged. The tire began to deflate. They will catch up with us at this rate! What are you playing at? What do you mean? From what I could see, you have 2 cameras at the entrance, 3 in the hallway, and you even have 5 in this room. You planned to film our discussion and send it to the FBI? Or to have someone analyzes the situation, hidden in another room? Do something, Andre! They're getting dangerously close! I'd love to! If Shuichi were here, he'd find a way. Shu. Do you think I look like him? My voice or face? Your face is a disguise, and your voice is a modifier. Where can you be? Modifier? I conducted my investigation in the neighborhood this morning. I wanted to know if your neighbor, Professor Agasa, had not suddenly stopped selling a superb invention. The voice modifier collar. It modulates the waves produced by the vocal cords and changes the voice. A very useful gadget. Why didn't you tell me? It is easily concealable under a turtleneck. Answer me, Shu! A collar like yours. Damn it, the tire is flat! This is the end. Oh no. Open the back window. Open it, Andre. Got it! Shu! Shuichi! Shuichi? What's he doing here? Hey, slow down now! We have to wait for orders. Your phone is ringing. Yes? You took a while. Is Shuichi in the car? - 5 seconds. - What? You'll soon have a straight line of 200 meters. Maintain the steering and speed for 5 seconds. This cat and mouse game has lasted too long. Got it! Can you tell me where you've been all this time? And what are you doing in the car? It was all part of the plan. That boy's plan. - When you say "he", you mean Conan? - Yes. In order to ensure my survival, it would have been normal that I limit my contact with you. But for the plan to work, I had to lure you out of town. As I knew that you were going to doubt my death, I expected you to get back to Raiha Pass. Andre. The straight line is just after this right turn. All right! I would maintain the speed and steering for 5 seconds. It's insane, the tire is flat! The car is shaking too much to aim! I'll be fine. If it is a regular tremor, I can correct my course. Shu. Turn right! I'm counting on you, Andre. Straight line! Copy that. 1. 2. 3. 4. Shuichi fired? Are you still chasing him? Well, there was a carom. I don't care! Take another car and track him down! If he escapes us here, who knows where he'll be hiding next? Can you speak less loudly? Look, the owner of this house. He just won a prize and he's gonna make a speech. However, I never met him. Good morning. As you just heard, I am the author Yusaku Kudo. I have the honor of receiving this magnificent award today, this is especially thanks to the immense work of the film crew and thanks to the talent of the actors that captured the essence of my script. But first and foremost, I want to thank the man who inspired me for agent scarlet. Have you been inspired by someone? Yes. And to be honest, my wife fell under his spell. He is a true gentleman, a handsome man with such a presence. It's even a pity to let him be just an FBI agent! Finally, that's what my wife always says. Shinichi's father has a cute side. Even so, To ask us to chase in this situation. You good? Shuichi! Shuichi? What? Is Shuichi there? Answer! What's going on? Answer me! It's been a while, Bourbon. Sorry, do I have to call you T?ru Amuro now? Shuichi Akai! You know my name? I already had doubts before, but you made the mistake of saying your nickname to the kid, Rei Furuya. I guess you had a plan to capture me and surrender myself to the organization to climb the ladder. Let me tell you this. Do not deceive yourself with a prey by being obsessed on what you see in front of you. I would not like that you become my enemy. Also, I always blame myself for what happened to him. Andre, you can go. I always blame myself for what happened to him. Bourbon took several times confirming Shuichi's appearance hoping to discover the truth about his so-called death. But his plan was brought to naught. I can't take it anymore. Thanks to the plan I developed with Shuichi, but also with the help of my parents, we were able to turn the situation around. It was a no-hit plan! Did you already plan on another work? Nothing much at the moment. Yusaku's shoes compress my feet too much, and the collar scratches me too. I want to go! In order to break through the enemy's defenses, Shuichi disguised his death thanks to the help of the CIA spy, who also infiltrated the organization. But he knew that if the organization learned he was alive, they would target him and his loved ones. So I told him to take the identity from Subaru Okiya, a young student, and learn about the enemy, thanks in particular to Professor Agasa, from the comfort of my home. There are several people who knows his identity. My parents are now aware, but also the FBI. Soon after that. The memory came back to me. What if Masumi hadn't studied in the United States, but in England? 10 YEARS AGO It's been a while. What's up? Yeah, it's been 7 years, right? You've grown up. You must be in high school now. Yes. Come on, introduce yourself. You've never seen him, have you? Good morning. It's me, Masumi. By the way, where's mom? She was supposed to meet you at the hotel. You guys didn't come together? We met at the hotel, yes. She attacked me with bare hands, and I couldn't avoid it all. But well, I got a few hits too. She must surely be putting some ice right now. Put ice on your eye instead. I let you go to study in the United States, and you dare tell me you were investigating about your missing father? And to top it off, you want to join the FBI after graduating? So you're that much attracted to death? Maybe in this safe country, you will remember the most important thing, especially your father's last words, sent right after we got here. "From now on, consider me dead. I apparently made an endmy of some really bad people. I will never forget this message. You're forgetting something. We haven't found the body yet. Okay, let's go eat noodles in one of the beach restaurants. All right! So he's my other big brother? Unlike Shukichi, he's not smiling. I'd like to see him smile. It's decided! It works every time. Everyone laughs when they see this! Don't mess with food. What? It didn't work? What are you doing, Masumi? Mom. You're a girl, be cleaner. You got pieces of chips and salt in the nose. Sorry. Is that a common gag in England? You're English, am I wrong? Potatoes cut into matches and fried in oil, they call it "French fries" in our house. America talk about "French fries". The English say "chips", as in "fish and chips", hence my guess. Anyways, have you seen my son? He has green shorts and he's with a girl of the same age. No. Okay. Where did he go? Thank you anyway. Goodbye. You're welcome. Shin! Where are you? Were you talking about being safe? A lambda woman discovered your home country with one word. No country is safe, mom. Don't worry. Before those who killed dad unmask me, I would have sent them all to hell. I have unmasked you. I know who you are! You're a clown! A clown? I'm sure, after listening to you. You are saying you've been to several countries. And as far as I know, only circus performers do that! Seeing your left eye, it seemed obvious to me. That left hand's mark that you have on your left wrist. It is a common mark among accordion players. My father told me that by doing the back and forth while pressing the buttons, the strap rasp on the wrist. And we often see clowns playing it during circus performances. In addition, although there are lots of types of clowns, they are the only circus performers to use a tear makeup. Just like on your left eye there's tear makeup remaining. Surely you forgot to remove the makeup because you were eager to come and sunbathe, but I'm not fooled! You're really a clown! Am I wrong? He laughed. Sorry, kid. It's true that I have traveled well in several countries, but I'm not a circus performer. Really? Otherwise, everyone who loves to travel would also be circus performers. Ah, right. Thinking this mark was because of an accordian was impressive but, but it goes back a day where I played for a client in a bar. It makes it possible to round off the end of the month. On the other hand, this mark to my left eye is not makeup. It's a wound inflicted by a violent mother. But tell me, who are you? Well, My name is Shinichi Kudo. I'm a follower of Sherlock Holmes! The follower of Sherlock Holmes? Shinichi! You were there! Your mom's looking for you. Ah, Ran. You're still playing detective? It's not a game. I'm training to be a detective. If you continue, you're gonna get in trouble. The guys from just now were very angry. Don't worry about those idiots. Kid. Here you are at last. You did well shaming us at the restaurant. You're the wrongdoers. You put a fly on your plate, all this to make a scandal and leave without paying. If you hadn't fucked us, it would have worked! Forgive me, but this young man is with me. If you want to talk to him, you'll have to talk to me first. We'll talk as much as you want as soon as I gouged your eyes out. Sorry! That was amazing! What was that, as a technique? The "finger jab", in other words, it stings the eyes. This is a technique of Jeet Kune Do. Really? The "finger jab", a technique of Jeet Kune Do. That's so cool! Say, would it bother you to play with my sister? She'd like to make friends. - All right. - Yes! But the calm was short-lived. The car! She fell into the water! For real!? There's a bag in the back. It is filled with luxury watches. And labels are still present. There was another passenger on board. Ah, you're finally back! Can we save him? No, it's too late. And what's that bag? It is something to discover the identity of this man. By the way, I have a favor to ask you. There are shops that sell swimsuits, on the beach. Go ahead and ask the sellers if someone soaked would have bought clothes after the accident. Well? Can you do it? Sherlock's follower. Yes, I will. Hey. Thanks. Did you come alone with that boy? No, Shinichi's mom is with us. Could you ask her to call the police? Say a car fell into the sea. All right! Shinichi's mom! What about me? What can I do? I want to help you, too! Do you not remember? Someone who would have bought a piece of clothing. He must have had soaked hair. 3 people meet this description. I saw them, while I hesitated to buy this t-shirt. Is that true? I play shogi, so I have a very good memory. Are you sure? You really think that there was another passenger on board? The gentleman said it. Do you have any evidence? The passenger side window was the only completely lowered. The steering wheel was on the right, so why would the driver opened the window on the left side? I think before the car fully submerged, the passenger went out the window and mixed with the other swimmers. Then he abandoned his colleague and fled alone? No. This man was not tied his belt before the accident. Meaning, when the car hit the safety guardrail, he was thrown against the windshield and the shock killed him instantly. The passenger did try to call him, but he very quickly understood that his colleague was dead. He made the most rational choice of leaveing from the the car alone. But why would he mix with the other swimmers? He could have passed himself off as a simple victim. He must have a good reason to hide. And the evidence is, on him. A good reason to hide? Have you been alerted to a robbery at a watch shop near here? Well, yes. An hour ago, in a watch shop, 1 kilometer from here, two thieves allegedly stole watches. Mr. Clown! I found everyone who bought clothes after the accident! - It's them, isn't it? - Yes. Hey, Yukiko. I told you not to bother me before dinner, because I'm writing my novel. Go bathe and bask in the sun. What? A car plunged into the sea and the driver died? This man was apparently a thief. I'll send you a picture, can you find the culprit? I want to know! You may ask me but, a simple photo will not help me. I see. Case closed. All that's left is to point the finger at the culprit. I got my idea. - It's the woman in the sandals. - It's the woman in the sandals. Yasue Kitameri. You are the passenger from the crashed car. Unbelievable! I too came to this conclusion. You're wearing one of the stolen watches. What are you saying? It is identical to those sold in the shop. It's normal, I bought it there! But the needles indicate 10:10. Well, it went haywire in the water. What? Don't you know? The majority of watches sold in stores indicate 10:10 so that we can see the brand name well. And so, the investigation was solved. Shuichi. Are you done? We're going home. All right. Well? Have you changed your mind? Are you giving up on the idea of joining the FBI? On the contrary, I want it even more. You're scaring me, Shuichi. Looks like you're possessed by a ghost. I am not possessed, I am ravaged by the fever of curiosity. Tsutomu. He really is his father's son. Shuichi, I wish you'd stayed in Japan and that you act like a father for Shukichi and Masumi. But I give up. Go, Shuichi. Follow your curiosity until your last breath. Bring the truth out into the open. In exchange, I won't forgive you if your curiosity burns out. Don't worry, I intend to do that. What's happening to you, mom? You took the same tone as dad. Starting today, I'm also taking on the role of father. Um, hey. The detective wants to talk to you. He would like to discuss the case again at the police station. I'll let you take care of it. After all, you are the disciple from the best-known detective in my country! Besides, do you think you're a better detective now? Yes! Shuichi you looked like Sherlock Holmes. No, Sherlock Holmes is even more amazing! But well, You looked like Watson. Dr. Watson, huh? That's fine with me! He's laughing again! See you, disciple of Sherlock Holmes! Say, You're like a real magician! You're like a real magician! You're a real magician! You're a real magician! What? Do I have something on my face? Uh, no. Wait a second. The man present with Masumi and Shuichi was definitely Taiko Meijin. They even called him Shukichi. But what intrigues me, it is this woman who is called "Mary". Shukichi even called her "mom". This woman and Masumi's so-called exiled sister are the same person. Many mysteries remain to be solved. But in the face of the Black Organization, it seems obvious that this family will also join this battle. Just like me. The Akai family. A family at the heart of danger who knows no boundaries.
