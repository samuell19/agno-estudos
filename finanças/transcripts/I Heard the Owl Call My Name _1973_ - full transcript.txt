The village is gonna have a priest again. We just heard they're sending a priest. (organ music) - Merry Christmas, Mark. - Merry Christmas, my lord. The cathedral looks beautiful at Christmas time. [Bishop] And you're sorry to be leaving here. No, my lord, but, well... [Bishop] I know you're disappointed in your assignment. No, my lord. But I'd like to ask you, why there? Is it because I've been ill? I'm alright now. Well, I want to serve the church actively. And you think serving a Kwakiutl village will be restful? Is that what you think? A holiday? It's quite the opposite. You will work harder than you have ever worked. Then, why there? Because you are so well-schooled. You're so well-trained. And so well-read and because, (laughs) You know nothing. And the Indians will teach you, as they taught me. (bell rings) Mark. If you run out of money or supplies, I can help you. But if you're confused and afraid and lonely up there, that's out of my reach. That's for you to fight, win if you can. Three days out of Vancouver up the coast, you'll be in the world of Indians and loggers and wilderness. I'll try to make it my world, too. Oh, your Indian deckhand. He's been working our world for a year now. Learn from him, Mark. He knows more about that boat and the coast than we'll ever know. You'll find him watching you. (chuckles) You'll find them all watching you. And in their own time, they will accept you. Or reject you. Jim. I'd like you to meet Mark Brian, your new vicar. - Jim Wallace. - Glad to meet you. Jim, will you be sure to say hello to George P and Marta for me? Tell 'em I miss 'em, think of 'em? I will. We're ready? All ready. Now, watch. God bless you, Mark. ("Amazing Grace") My dear bishop. Yesterday I watched traffic jams and skyscrapers. Today I saw an eagle fishing. It swooped down near the boat and caught a fish, but the fish was too heavy to lift from the water, and the eagle couldn't loosen its grip, so it drowned. It was a life and death struggle, but so small, and played out so quietly. Jim and I watched it. He seemed to be a part of it all. Shall I take it a while? If you don't mind my asking, how did you get the name Jim Wallace? How do white men get their names? From their fathers and grandfathers. Me, too. I get my name from the same people. Your fathers and grandfathers. They came here 100 years ago and said, "All you Indians gotta be registered, what's your names?" Some of the Indian fellows, (speaks foreign language). The white guy said, "What? I can't pronounce that. "From now on, your name is Wallace. "Next." And that's how I got my name. (birds squawk) I know your people live where they've always lived. I know a few things I've learnt from the bishop. He was vicar of your village. Before I was born. [Mark] How big is Kwakiutl? Jim, how big is your village? White man always say that, "How big is your village?" You just don't get it. [Mark] Well, tell me, I'll get it. My village is so big that it never gets rained on. Because the rain is my village, too. And the wind. And the sea. Get it? I think so. All the history of my tribe and all of its legends... That's my village, too. And me, I am the village. And the village is me. And you don't get it. (peaceful music) Who's that? An old prospector, he works these mountains. [Mark] By himself? [Jim] For 30 years. Name's Bill Murphy, no family. 30 years. Alone. Hi there, preacher! I'm your new vicar, Mark Brian! And don't call me preacher! [Bill] Good luck, preacher! (peaceful music) My dear bishop. Kwakiutl surprised me around a bend of shore, standing where it's always stood. It didn't wave to me. Hardly seemed to notice. I thought the people might be waiting, but it was me waiting and wondering, what does this place want of me? (chatter in foreign language) (chatter in foreign language) (melancholic string music) (chatter in foreign language) My first church, Jim. Come see your first vicarage. (woman sings in foreign language) She's a professional mourner. The figeritch is being used. Used? Who is he? My cousin. Three days ago, he fell off the wharf between boats. Nobody saw him. Why isn't he buried? We have to wait for the RCMP to give a burial permit. Will you take me to his mother, please? This is his mother. Does she speak English? Yes. I'm sorry. (mother speaks foreign language) What did she say? (mother speaks foreign language) She says she heard the owl call his name. Huh? [Jim] It means, she knew her son was going to die. I'm sorry. Shall we say a prayer together? Oh lord, Jesus Christ, who didst take little children into thine arms, and bless them. Open thou our eyes. We beseech thee. Oh, Lord, help me to have the courage... (woman sings in foreign language) (baby cries) (baby cries) Oh, heavenly father, whose face the angels of the little ones do always behold in Heaven, grant us steadfastly to believe that this child hath been taken into the safe keeping of thine eternal love. Through Jesus Christ, our lord. Amen. The lord bless you and keep you. The lord make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious unto you. The lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace, both now and evermore. Amen. (rattling) (George sings in foreign language) (bright music) (church bell tolls) Good morning. In case we haven't met, I'm Mark Brian. Now, before we begin, I have to say, that I don't sing very well without an accompaniment. So, is there anyone who can play the organ? It does work. No. (bird squawks) ♪ Christ, the royal master ♪ ♪ Leads against the foe ♪ ♪ Forward into battle ♪ ♪ See his banners go ♪ ♪ Onward, Christian soldiers ♪ ♪ Marching as to war ♪ ♪ With the cross of Jesus ♪ ♪ Going on before ♪ Take and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for thee.

I've been at Kwakiutl a week now. I came at a time of sorrow, for a child had been taken from you, and the village was in mourning. We know that the little boy we buried is with Christ. Now, mourning has been put aside, and you started your work again. What concern me, therefore, are the living children of Kwakiutl. I seen them this week, so willing and eager for life, that I must ask you, if what is here in this village is enough. Enough for them in the years ahead. You are great fishermen. Your people have put out to sea for countless generations. And I would ask you, this morning, to help me to build a boat. A different kind of boat. One that will carry your children, on the difficult journey from this village to the white man's world. I know that we can build such a boat. We can build it together. With education, faith in God and his help. Faith in ourselves. I hope you understood what I was trying to say. You're saying our village is sick and dying, and all our children should leave. - No! - We're not sick. I feel pretty good! Any of you who can, do come to my house for some coffee. (melancholic music) (melancholic music) (birds squawk) Oh, hello, I'm Mark Brian. Ah, yes, the vicar. I'm Alan Spender. Yes, they said you were coming today. Well, old Sam's at you already, is he? When he's drunk, he beats his wife and daughter. When he's sober, he begs for money to buy liquor. You're a great man, Sam, may your tribe increase. This is my last term here, if I can stand it. The isolation pay almost makes it worth while, almost. [Mark] Do you teach all seven grades? - Yes. - Then where do they go? They go nowhere. The boys fish, the girls marry the boys and so on and on. Well, I for one would be nowhere at all, if it hadn't been for a teacher of seven grades who took an interest. This is nowhere at all. Look, I teach seven grades. You dispense your sacraments. I'm not here only to perform the sacraments. What are you here for? Look at that house of yours, it's falling down. The village flows right around it. They don't care if it falls down. They don't need it, it's irrelevant. So are you, vicar. And so am I. (dog barks) (melancholic music) Yes, you are ridiculous, you know. Irrelevant and ridiculous. You're a joke. You and me both. (glass smashes) (children laugh) (laughs) Hello. Hello. What are you called? I'm Mark Brian, I always break windows like that. It's good exercise. Come on. Tell me your names. (Children laugh) Good exercise. [Mark] Oh, hello. These are my new friends. They're John and Lisa, my cousins. - I'm Keetah. - I'm Mark Brian. Jim Wallace told me about you. "Keetah's a princess," he said, "from a proud family who took no English name.” Is that true? Yeah. He also said he was gonna marry you. Jim has no manners, I'm to marry Gordon. Who's Gordon? Gordon Hudson. He's going to a school in Port Alberni. We only see him in the summers or on holidays. He's the first boy from Kwakiutl to go to high school. [Mark] The first? Don't the others go to school? Everything they need is here. The world's changing, Keetah. Not in the village. Not so much. Keetah, once there were totem poles here, and no planes flying overhead and nothing to do but fish. Now all the totem poles have gone. The world's crowding in, Keetah. Now the children could learn to be, well, to be more than fishermen. Some are loggers. There's a logging camp near here. But they don't like Indians so much. [Mark] But there are so many other things. Now, if the children went to school... My people like being fishermen. And they don't like the world crowding in. But is the world such an awful place? It gives you 1,000 things you can choose to be. You can go buzzing from one part of it to the next in a few hours. You talk like Gordon talks. When he makes me afraid. Sometimes I'm afraid he won't come back here. His grandfather, George P, is afraid, too. The village is his place. (woman speaks foreign language) Come, Lisa. With more learning, there'd be less fear, Keetah. (melancholic music) Ellie? Ellie. What's the matter? Look at me. What happened? Hey! I'm goin' to Martin's. Martin's. Martin's place, I'm goin'. Come on, Sam. If you beat your daughter again, I'll take her out of this house, I'll find another home for her, right? If he hits her again, you let me know, okay? Okay, come on in now, don't be a fool. - This is my house! - This is my parish! [Wife] What'd you do that for anyway? [Sam] This is my house. [Wife] You're supposed to respect, you know that.

I'm just beginning to separate the people of Kwakiutl, and see individuals. Notice that there's a whole life going on in each house. In each face. - Hi, David. - Oh! - Oh, you just made that? - Yeah, I just made that. That's a great seller, that. Very good, you'll be rich. (Chuckles) On special days, the men of Kwakiutl fish for the whole village. Each family gets its share. These people have brought me back to that feeling of family. Something I've not had since I was a boy. - Good fishing today. - Good fishing. Good luck. Come, swimmer, I'm glad to be alive now that we have come to this good place where we can play together. Take this sweet food. - How do you know that prayer? - I read it in a book. Your people call the halibut, old woman, (speaks foreign language), for they respect the salmon. A swimmer. But the swimmer always dies. When they're born and tiny, the current takes them downstream. They fight it. They go backwards trying to swim. Then they turn and face their dangers, then the current takes them to the sea. Nobody knows where they go. How far they go. One day, their bodies tell 'em to go back. They go back to where they were born. They spawn and they die. See? They're dyin' now. Still tryin' to swim. But they'll die. And the current will take their bodies out to the sea. Tail-first, like before. It's sad. Not sad, it's a life of adventure, Keetah. When the swimmer dies, he's spent himself completely, for the end he was meant for, it's a triumph. You belong to the salmon people. You're a swimmer. (melancholic music) (chatter in foreign language) - What's that? - That means water. - Water. - Water. (speaks foreign language) (chatter in foreign language) Yes! (Laughs) That, stones, the rocks. (Bird calls) (speaks foreign language) What does it mean? The raven. Legend says that the raven stole the sun from a chief who kept it in a box. And he put it in the sky for us. And the owl... He calls your name when you're going to die? Yes, yes. And when a child die in the olden days, the mother would kick the body three times. And say, "Don't look back. "Don't turn your head. "Walk straight on, you are going to the land of the owl." Most of our legends has death in them. It's something we know about. (dog barks) - Hello, Marta. - Hello. Oh, that smells good. - Is it ready? - Yes. Oh, wonderful. Thank you. You look pretty bad. I'm no fisherman, Marta. I'm no handyman about the house, either. You going out tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow I take the boat to the other villages and the logging camps. Here. For you. To keep your head warm when you're out in the boat. Oh, thank you. How do I look? Exactly like an egg.

("Amazing Grace") (door creaks) (baby cries) Ever since the birth, she's been bleeding and bleeding. Couldn't get her out in our boat because of the storm. Sarah? Sarah. Your baby... Is well.

That's true, white girls love to chase Indian boys. And I don't blame them. (Chuckles) (playful music) (children laugh) Hey, hey! Soccer isn't one of your sacraments, is it? Now look, I've told you to stay right away from my place. I like a bit of peace and quiet after school. Doesn't anything sink in, Charlie? David? Your head gets harder every day. You're all turning into totem poles. You don't listen, what are you good for? - Totem poles. - Wait a minute. I don't care what you think about this place, but your attitude is hurting these kids. You wanna make them feel small, don't you? You like them to be afraid, they're not clowns, you know! They're not your clowns, and I won't have you belittling them, not in my parish! - Where's the ball? - Right here! Come on, come on. (melancholic music) You see? In the old days, they used to put a person's best possession on the grave. Eight years ago, this boat went down and two men died. We never found their bodies, just this cabin. So, it's their grave. One of the men was Gordon's father. The other was mine. They died together. But Gordon and I will live together, so that something of them will still be alive in the village. Yes. ("Amazing Grace") My lord, thank you for sending me to Kwakiutl. In 10 months, the Indians have given me a lifetime of learning. I wonder what I give them in return. (birds squawk) More of them come to my church, ask my help, share with me. But there is still much that is out of my reach. I want to be able to touch each life, because they've all touched mine. (melancholic piano music) Winter's come again and I'm afraid it's slowed me down. I'm a bit weak, tired. The doctor in Tufina says he needs more tests, so I'll see him again soon. Meanwhile, I pray for wisdom. Young Gordon Hudson has come home, and the village is different because of it. They love him, but I think they resent how he's changed. And as they feared, he's decided to leave the village for good. And Keetah is going with him. Keetah? You'll be as lonely and afraid in the city as I was when I first came here. But it passes. It passes. Here you are, David, I'd like you to have these. I've had some of them for years, I don't suppose you'll want to read them all now, but I hope you will one day. There's a couple of Dickens, a copy of Vanity Fair, Saint Augustine, Spinoza. Thank you. When will you be off? Right after the Christmas holidays. Well, David, I think you made a very good choice. And, uh... I hope things work out very well for you. Thank you. You're proud of what you're doing, are you? Sending our children away. I couldn't discourage him. Going on to school will give him the opportunity... What is opportunity? Opportunity is something that can make change a good thing. You will destroy our village. Those young people who leave do not come back. That's not so, George. Please, let's have no bad feeling. ("Amazing Grace") My lord. Mark. Marta has written me. Marta? Why didn't you tell me how ill you were? Oh, it's nothing. [Bishop] Yes, it is something. No, really, it's nothing. I've been meaning to have some more tests, but I've been so busy. Well, you will have... You'll have some time to yourself now, because... Your work here... Is over. Over? But I've just begun. I can't leave now. Mark. When you were ill a year ago... [Mark] I recovered, I'll recover again. The doctors told me... Please, my lord, let me finish my work here. You don't have time. You're nearly out of time. The doctors told me a year ago, "The man should be active," they said, "but it's a matter of time." Mark, maybe I was wrong not to have told you, but that was my decision. I'm just run down. I could have kept you with me in Vancouver. But there was no family to consider. Just this eager, young man who... Who was running out of time. (Mark sighs) And what could I do for him? See, I felt this village was the place where you could come closest to life. As I did. I learned enough, Mark, about life here, to be ready to die. But I was here 10 years. You've only had a year. Was I wrong? Yes. You were wrong to send these people... A dying man. It isn't a dying race. You've served them well, Mark. And now, I want you to come with me to Vancouver. I want you to stay with me. Give me till Christmas. Let me have a Christmas here. (man sings in foreign language) George P's giving a grandson his Indian name. It's very important. Do you have an Indian name? (woman speaks foreign language) Oh, that's pretty. (dramatic percussive music) (man sings in foreign language) (group sings in foreign language) My dear bishop. I remember an old man from the village. He'd been in the city and he'd come back. And he said to me, "away from here, I couldn't sleep. "I couldn't eat. "At night, I dreamt of the sands of Kwakiutl, "and I knew I had to return, "for the village is the only place where I know myself." My lord, I look at these people who know themselves so well, who have a place where I have none, and it tears me apart. For already I am rehearsing how to say goodbye to them. (group sings in foreign language) - Brian. - Spencer. Can your sacraments compete with theirs? They don't have to, Spencer, they don't have to. (suspenseful music) Marta? I heard the owl. [Marta] Yes. It called my name. Yes. (suspenseful music) (peaceful music) (birds squawk) (dog barks) (bell rings) ("Amazing Grace") (knocks) Hello! Come in! Goodness, what brings you back here? Sit down, we'll have some coffee. Are you alright? I couldn't stay there in the city. It wasn't my place. What happened? I want you to know that I'm carrying Gordon's child. I hope I am. Is that so that he'll have to come back here? He'll never know about it. But I want something of him to be left alive in the village. I know that, in your eyes, what I've done is wrong. And that I'm not welcome in the church. No, Keetah, no, I'm not...

I've learnt this year of the strength of your life here. I know it's not slipping away. I know your children won't let it die. What your children are building is not a boat that will carry them away, but a bridge, so that they, and all people, can go back and forth, learning from each other. Without fear.

Every rock and tree. Every bird and fish and bit of moss. Here, we all seem to have found our small place on Earth. Thank you, my lord, for sending me to Kwakiutl. Are you going out? Just a short trip in the boat. [Jim] Should I come with you? No, I'll be alright. I hear you're building a new house. Yes. Who for? For my family. When I marry Keetah, her baby will be mine. She's been to the city, Jim, and it didn't work. But she did reach out. You take care of her. Why are you telling me this? Because I care for you both. Are you sure you're okay? Sure, I'm one of the salmon people, remember. (Chuckles) I'll be fine. Oh, lord, whose days are without end, and whose mercies cannot be numbered.
