It's just gone past... midnight at Radio Province. Today is Mother's Day. A holiday celebrated in honor of the most important women in our lives. The origins of this special day can be traced back to Ancient Greece and Rome. In 17th century England it was known as "Mothering Sunday." Traditionally... Hey, doll! ...bring gifts... - Where are you going? - ...mainly flowers and candy. And now a beautiful song from Radio Province to all moms. DEATH TO THE ENEMIES OF THE HOMELAND Beer? - Three? - Six. You're quite a babe. Your hair is nice. Is it curly only up here? - Leave her alone! - Hey, shut it! Calm! Why are you so twitchy? Keep your hands off! Relax, babe. Gentlemen... Leave the ladies alone. This isn't right, gentlemen. What? Did you hear that? Don't drop your beers! Hey, Mommy! And now what? You've ruined the fun! We came here to enjoy ourselves. Yeah! Yo, Momma! I'm talking to you! Nice butt, but turn around! - So, what now? - I'm not on my own. Can you count? What's the distance between us? Two and a half? Two meters thirty? So? Goodbye? Two meters twenty. What the hell? Ms. Nina! Don't cross the line, like the last time! Hey! Come on, go! Go get her! Come on! Final round. - Come on! - Let's get out of here! - Go! - Come on! Get up. THURSDAY MOTHER'S DAY MOTHER'S DAY S'up! - S'up. - S'up. And see ya. Soz, I was supposed to be back earlier. And soz for going out in the morning. Soz, but it's not about that. Aw! - Happy birthday! - Thanks! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. There was a barrel at the Kandahar base. A metal barrel, partially buried in the ground. - And on return from patrol... - Which you never did, as office staff. And on return from patrol, you had to aim at the barrel and pull the trigger. Do you know why? For safety, just in case. So, you didn't blow anyone's brains out. You don't pay attention? Somebody pays for someone else's stupidity. Are you done? You lose focus when you're close. He's my kid. - Same thing every year. He's happy. - They're spoiling him. Great! Fantastic. Kids should be spoiled. It's good to meet up, right? Once in a while. Everything's fine. Where are the candles? Where are the flowers? Not giving a damn about the fallen is the firm's standard. You came up with the legend, now you have it. Put it down. Do you enjoy bullying me like that? Yeah. How's life? Peachy, thank you. At least someone's is. R.I.P. MAJOR NINA NOWAK BORN 07.12.1980 DIED 21.09.2005 FALLEN IN DEFENSE OF HER HOMELAND SATURDAY CHILLAX WITH THE FAMILY # PARENTS #FOLKSSTILLGOTIT - Come here, little shit! - What's going on? Fuck! Let go! Come here! WARSAW RAILWAY STATION Get him! Move it, move it, move it! Z.MALECKI1998 HE NEVER CAME BACK HOME ZDZISIEK123 ANYONE IN TOUCH WITH HIM? ASIA.WAWA ME NEITHER... ANKA WWA.28 FUCK ZIELONY GRZYB 2912 IS HE MISSING?! PAN SAMOCHODZIK HE'S GONE PIOTREK.1966 DIDN'T COME BACK Pay up, pay up, pay up! Where's my alimony? No alimony? Zosia won't visit you. Pay, pay, pay, pay! Alimony, alimony, alimony, alimony... Maybe it's a prank? Maybe they had a fight? You know how it is with teenagers. You have friends in police. I can't interfere with the investigation. Get some intel. Maybe he got drunk with friends, and he's afraid to go home? Maybe he's already at home? Just don't go there. Stay away from them. This is unbelievable. Three hours to file a report. You can find a missing person in three hours. That's just... At least they're looking for him. There's nothing more we can do. I think I'm going mad. No, no, no. POLICE This is Max's phone. The kidnappers left a recording. It hasn't been recorded in evidence yet, so don't be too long. LAST RECORDING I am Duśan Dragan, son of Spiridon Dragan. He was killed by Nina Nowak, aka Kikimora. This is my revenge on her. I can't kill her, so I will kill her son. You won't find him. Blood for blood. Life for life. How does he know? - You've leaked again? - Even if we did, nobody knows. With each new minister comes purge. This hasn't changed since your times. - Anything else? - Come on, I don't know. It's my daughter. Like regime, like ambassador... And this particular regime doesn't look good. Our intelligence hypothesis has been confirmed. Madam diplomat is in the laundry business. The laundry service is located in her embassy and accepts dirt from Polish clients. These clients have very dirty hands. And they're involved in very dirty business. This is... Beauty... She ships dirty cash to her lovely country in diplomatic transports, injects it into the local banking system and... And then withdraws clean cash on our side. The regime takes thirty percent. Who orders the laundering? We know that too. Volto, Voltmeter. Aka Little Bitter. Son of the well-known Big Bitter, thanks to his son, currently held in an underground cell. The palace coup is a recent development. Voltmeter is a nutjob... on the top of this shit pyramid. Below him there's... Titus, aka Titus Konopka. He runs the human trafficking department. Next in line is... Baton. Aka Ivo Jarecki. He runs the meth, pookie, crystal department. It's completely outrageous that these scoundrels are financing a regime, that bludgeons, tortures, and kills its own citizens. We'll shut down this enterprise. And lock up these sons of bitches. WARSAW CITY MONITORING SYSTEM Okay, take him. Move it, move it, move it! YUM-YUM They're Voltmeter's men. Drugs, racketeering, human trafficking. He keeps a tight grip on everything illegal in this city. - Where is he? - Nobody knows. But even if he got an order to kidnap Max, he didn't do it. It was his apes. - Don't get mixed up in this. - Where are his apes? YUM-YUM For me, the current situation is dope. We were just errand boys to the old man. "Break this guy's leg." "Kidnap that guy's chick." "Throw him out the fucking window." Great fucking prospects. And with Volto? No more petty shit. Promotion... We'll be VIPs! But it's kinda wack to decapitate your old man and put his head in a jar... You didn't know? He keeps it on a shelf at home. Baton? He came back light. Light? - Why? - He says the client changed his mind. There are no dry runs at Yum-Yum. Whoever does dry runs is... a dick. And a dick deserves... a massage. Come here. Where's the boy? Where's the boy? Ma'am... If a man says... he doesn't beat women, he's a chauvinist. But all of us believe in gender equality. Where's the boy? At Titus' place. He's got him, Ma'am. We just plucked him off the street. Where's Titus? They didn't perforate... Mm. Overtime to clean up this fuck-up. At least the cash is right. Let's go. Move it! Keep going. You know what, Daddy? I think that it's possible to make moola... and have a good time. I'm having a good time, Daddy. I'm having a blast, Daddy. Daddy, I am... totally losing myself in this fun. Dad, hello? Dad! Ahh... Uh-uh-uh-uh. Uh? Even now you won't look at me. Volto. Duśan Dragan is calling. Daddy, watch how to do international business. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... No, no, no, no. Don't say anything now, my dear. Be quiet. Dad... Moshi-Moshi. This is the Polish Postal Service. Has the package arrived? The package arrived. It's waiting at the pick-up point. My courier will arrive in two days. He will collect the package. When can we expect the second installment? The courier will bring the money. He'll give it to you if the package is intact. May I ask what you're going to do with the package? We will open it and take everything out. Is there a problem? Not at all! I recommend myself for the future. Bye-bye! Moshi-Moshi. One skirt did this? We were surprised, too! Boss, she got helluva beating! Everything's under control! That's bad. Really bad. Your pop used to say that sometimes. But the business... went well. Who were those people? Who are you? You ask too many questions. - I don't understand! - Do you want to go home or not? Then listen to me! Okay? Do what I say. The less you know, the better. Calm down. Calm down! If they see us, we're dead! They'll kill you! And me. And if they kill me, no one will help you. Okay? Mm-hmm. Come. Fucking awesome pad. It's safe. We had gotten a job. APPRECIATE AND RESPECT HARD WORKERS An important job! From an important client. This job was supposed to pave the way for us to new markets. We were going to expand internationally! And create a strong national brand respected around the world. But we won't. Maybe we should catch them? You know where they are? Yes? Exactly. Do you know who'll have to find out? Let me enlighten you. Come here. Come. Moola. Is CCTV up and running? The cameras. What? Video-fucking-recorder. Oh. Yeah! - Is it working? - It's working. We're not telling the client about this mess. How will we find the kid? Dial the Witch. We have to call the Witch. Well? A woman? Just one? All of them? And the money? How much? Send over whatever's left. No, for fuck's sake! With a messenger pigeon. It's not good that your other ventures interfere with ours. I'm not your intelligence agency. It's not the first time. Do we understand each other? Good. What a mess. Son! Mm. PLAYBACK Kikimora? Alive? Spies still at work? Mm. I want them to find her. What a mess. Do you need help? We had first aid classes at school. I'd like to call them. Calm them down. They'll trace the call. And they'll find us. Why did they kidnap me? For ransom? You know, don't you? - For fuck's sake! - Hey! Hey what? Hey what? - Do you talk back to you parents too? - No. We don't keep secrets. - Eat up. - I don't eat meat. If you went to university here... you could always live with me. Mm-hmm. There are good schools here. Or we could find you a studio apartment. How about we cut your mother's head off and make broth. It wouldn't taste good, Daddy. Listen. I don't want to impose on you, but wouldn't it be nice to see each other? You can visit us. But it's a really long flight. Hmm? They're here. Uh... When will you be back? I'll be better off there. Bye, Daddy. Bye. It's really lovely. Just lovely. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not lovely. Not lovely! Not lovely! Not lovely! Fuck! Call them. Who's them? His parents. Calm them down. Is he with you? What do you think? Dragan won't let you off. Neither will Voltmeter. They won't find us. You'll run for the rest of your life? Where are you? At my place. - There? - Here. Call them. Hello? Yes? Everything will be okay. Trust me. - How long did you talk? - What? - How long? - What's your problem? No! Stop it! What are you doing? Give it back. You're fucking crazy! Why am I here? Why the fuck am I here? Open the door! Give me the key! Just give it! You're a lunatic! Help! Help! Open the door! Help! Open the door! Help! Open the door. I knew your father. I knew your real father. What? He didn't die in an accident. Your parents didn't die in an accident. They killed us, one by one. They killed him. They wanted to kill me, so I disappeared. No, no! Max? - Max! - Yeah? Stay there! Don't move! Well? Where is she? Does it hurt? Take me to the hospital. Fuck. Come. Be quiet. So strong! So stubborn! Now what? Now what? How's that for you? How is it? POLICE What a mess. Is he back? Who are you? It's me. He's my boy. Hello! Hello! Calm down. It's an antiseptic. Please don't move, Ma'am. All done. Who messed... you up like this? - Is he back? - Why did you come here? What do you want? Where is he? - I'm calling the police. - That won't help! It'll make things worse. Is that you? Kikimora? Beauty... How's your knee? They gave me a new one. How are you? I hear you've lost your son. Don't worry, we've found him. Say something. It's your mom. How are the folks? They're fine. What should I tell her? Whatever you want. Go fuck yourself. You can tell he's yours right away. If you hurt him, I'll kill you. You've already tried, twice. Where is he? And that's your task. You'll know where he is after you've done one thing for me. Got it? I'm here. We're a poor country. Now poorer because to you. What task? Making sure we don't get any poorer. Your people took Volto's goods. He was an idiot, but a useful one. So... you will recover everything from them. You have five hours. We'll call you. I'll bring him back. Shh... Queen to D4. Knight to F6. Check. Impossible. It can't be done. You said that when I removed Saddam's bomb. Ten people? The money is locked at the Police Headquarters. There are 150 armed officers in that building. You want to kill them all? Civilians? - I won't kill anyone. - Really? What will you do? You'll let me in. You know people! You know what she's capable of. I'll get you the blueprints. That's it. Give me an hour. How did they find us so fast? Who came up with this plan, you or me? Here go my fucking hybrid nails. Let's go. Bring her up! There was no Duśan Dragan, right? There was. I am Duśan Dragan, son of Spiridon Dragan. Do you know what you'll do with the money? I'll take my fiancée on vacation. For a month or two. Somewhere warm. Borneo! Have you ever been to Borneo? Maybe we'll get married there? No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no1 Stop! Oh! I'm sorry! No, no, no, no! Is that all? Mm. - Wait! - Mm. What do you want? To let them go? What a mess. Tsk. Why did you it? Why? Anything for my kid! - Anything? - Yes, anything. Anything. - Anything? - Anything... - Anything? - Anything... Anything. Yes, anything! You'd do anything for Max. I'd do anything for Zosia. I needed that money. Don't do it, please! Get it? I really needed the money. Will I see you again? That's up to you. Bye then. Bye. Son! Hi. Hi. Your kitchens are really tiny. Tell me about him. About both of you. - You got into some serious shit. - Hi, Mom. Everyone knows about you. Both of you. Things are about to go down. You're fucking lucky I'm here. MOTHER'S DAY Right. Yeah. That's right. She was a liability to our intelligence operations. Police! On the ground! It's not me. Not me. Fuck! That was very uncool. May I call my daughter?
