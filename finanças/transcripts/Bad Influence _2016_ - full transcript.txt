- Go warn the others. - Ok. Are we taking something else? - We have to leave quickly. - Yes, but it's for us... We'll be quick. - Okay. - Keep watch, I'll be fast. Fucking shit. Dani? Catch this. - Let's go. - It's good, I'm coming. I'll take some Skittles, Mentos and chips. - Don't move. - What are they doing, damn? Let him go, asshole. - Let go of me. - Let him go. - Let me go, fuck. - Stop. You fucked up, Tano. Go away, Dani. Run, asshole. Shut up, bastard. - Run. - Stay calm. Fucking shit! I saw your mother. It's been a long time. She is in a bad state. Listen... They told me they were going to watch you. I am not like Natalia. With me... you do not want to mess around, or run off. Don't worry. I'm not like you. Pay attention, please. Sit down and close the curtains. Come on, let's move on. Be careful, please. Close the curtains. A new fire broke out this morning at exit 17 of the Valdivia highway. More than a dozen masked individuals whose identity is unknown burned and destroyed a truck belonging to the paper mill. The police have opened an investigation to find the culprits. The only clues about their identity are protest signs in connection with the Mapuche conflict that were found at the scene. Why are you hiding ? I've already seen you, you know. Alexis is very stubborn. The advantage is that many people will support us. - It is important. - You're important, Pedro. No, but... You have to face it, someone has to take care of it. You are not afraid ? If you continue, I'll crush you like a fly. It will get complicated. The cops will surely come here. Take care of yourself. I stopped all that. Move your asses, they're here. - Come on, Cheo. - Move your ass. Hurry up, you can't sit around with your hands in your pockets. - How are you, Cheo? - How are you ? Paula wrote you a letter. You're lucky, it's a nasty letter. A love letter. Come on, read it. What do you have ? You read well, go ahead. Why are you shy? Give it here, I'll help him. You read well. Listen, I'll read like you. "My beautiful little Cheo, "you are always alone in the yard, so I am going for it: will you meet me at the park and lick my breasts? " This is good, this letter. You have to go there, it's at 5pm. Have you ever had breastmilk? It's like normal milk, but thicker and more acidic. Cheers. It this your son ? No, that's me. You were beautiful. There, that's my son. - It's ugly, this baby. - It's true. Now, you could be handsome, but you dress like a sack of potatoes. - I do? - Yes. You were a little shitty, ugly, black and hairy. - Nice picture. - If you say so. You have to tidy up a bit. - Your clothes... - Are you yelling at me already? If the assistant arrives and sees your dirty boxer shorts, you're busted. I know, you told me so many times. - Shit... - What? Wasn't the road closed off? Yes, it was. They really messed everything up. But we were able to get past and arrive on time. All the better. And your son, how is he doing? It's okay, he's still getting his bearings. - Will he stay long? - I don't know yet. Classy. Alejandro? Motherfucker. Little bastard. Shit. I will be honest with you. I do not like sending young people to a juvenile center. In the case of Alejandro, even less. A stay in the center would destroy him. But to help him, it will take some effort. You are his only chance. Yes, I understand. Good. For the next hearing, we will ask him for a urine test and the court will make a decision. Let Alejandro continue to live with you, or he will go to a center. But you know, the fact that your son is not here right now doesn't help. Doesn't help at all. Anyone could report you. Just your past history would be enough for the court to take custody from you. You understand ? That's not what I want. I want to believe you. But in this case, you have to take this all seriously. What are you looking at ? You're not from here. I'm here for a few days. What? I'm here for a few days. - I'm leaving soon. - Where? What's it to you? Come on, get out of here. See ya! What's this ? Grape juice. You want some ? Here. Taste. Where can I find cigarettes? At the village. - How do I get there? - Walk. Whore. That's it, huh. Why do you have a stick? Are you standing guard? It's good, I'm doing nothing wrong. Okay, see you. - Where were you ? - I was just looking around. Did you drink my wine ? Just a little bit. Tomorrow, we will enroll you in school. - I made an appointment. - What? You did not tell me about that in Santiago. - I'm telling you now. - You can't do that to me. Do what? Educate you? - You don't get to just do what you want. - That's it, asshole. Who are you calling an asshole? Stupid old man. I'm wasting my time here. Give it back to me. - Hello. - Javier? - Yes. - Hello. This is your son ? - Alejandro. - Hello. Wait here. Come in, sir. Okay. Hello. You know him ? This is Javier's son. - Hello. - Hello. - How's it going ? - Good, you ? Good. Ready to go ? - We have to get going. - Ok, see ya. I'll put it in the bag, but do not wear it here. That side is broken, close it from here. Super, thanks. - What a look! - Yeah, I know. And for lunch? - That's all ? - That's not enough ? Hey, here's one more. - Why not two? - That's enough. - Yeah, see ya. - Hold on. Do not be stupid, okay? Do not make me feel ashamed. Excuse me. Do you have any cash? Do you have some or not? Give me some. Thank you. Tano? Do you get to sleep there? - Why ? - I dunno. With everything that happened. My father told me that a truck was on fire. Stop lying, you have no father. - They aren't so terrible. - You do not even know them. - I dunno. - Are you talking about Cheo? - No. - He's a jerk. One day he set fire to several backpacks. - Serious? - Yeah. In a few years, he'll be burning trucks. It was Paredes, you said he was shitting himself over it. It's bullshit. You are bad. Cheo is already shitting himself. Nice. You following me or what? No. - What are you doing, then? - Watching. - Your girlfriend did not want to introduce herself? - What? Leave it alone. - She is pretty. - Which one ? This one ? The one with big bumpers? Bumpers, you know. Oh forget it, dummy. This morning, raids were carried out in several homes in Ercilla. Old woman panties for you. It's for big butts. Among the detainees, two are minors. The police found a weapon belonging to the Mapuche. In Araucania, there is no question that the government calls for the application of anti-terrorist law. - So ? - What? - You like that one ? - Yes. It's cool. - Take it. - What? Watch out. - Thank you, goodbye. - Goodbye. It's good, you can take it out. Put it on. It's cool. Classy. It gives you a little swagger. Lend me your van. You're not going to mess it up? No, don't worry. At worst, I'll fix it on the spot, it's not a problem. You're funny. You're going to have a Pedro Junior, it'll change things. That's for sure. How are things at home? How is your kid? Like all kids, nothing new. Here! - Hello my brother. - Hi. - What are you doing? - Nothing. There is nothing to do in this shitty mess. You can watch TV, I have not finished. No. Cheo invited me to his place. It that true ? Yes. - Now ? - Yeah. Do you guys wear earrings in town? - Cool guys, yes. - Why not put in a stud? No, I prefer this. Do you want one? - Not yet. - Okay. Here, give it to your mother. Do not lose it. Put it in your bag. - Do not lose it. - You come home at 6pm. - At 6 o'clock. - Yes it's good. - Bye, Cheo. - See you ! Teens... What did you give him? - What was it ? - Mind your own business. - Here, eat one. - No. Come on, we're doing her a favor. All mothers are on a diet. It's good, right? I do not know why I'm asking you. It stinks like roast pig. - It's huge, what is it? - The paper factory. It's cool. No, everything is their fault. What do you know, you little shit? My house is over there. We're not going to your house, we're just walking. I have a gift for you. You know, one time... I was smoking in the bathroom, with my head out the window, I looked like a giraffe, all just so I wouldn't get caught. And suddenly, Roberto came in, very upset, he asked me: "What are you doing ?" I answered : "Nothing. You want some ?" Imagine how he reacted. He roughed me up, obviously. My mother was there, she was watching. He gave me a beating. Do you know what I did? Nothing. Like a warrior. I did not scream, I did not cry. I just kept looking him in the eye. They wet themselves when they see that you have balls. - I never knew him. - Who ? - My father. - He left ? No, he's dead. Shit, sorry. They all end up being fucked up, it's better that he's dead. My mom said he was cool. Moms always tell those kinds of lies. Come on, smoke. Go ahead. Smoke more than that. Wait a bit. Exhale. Classy. Did you like it ? Do you want more? You have class. You can be my friend. Otherwise, you can get lost. - You're sure ? - Yes, throw it and run. - Is it supposed to take this long ? - I dunno. - Are you kidding ? - No, I swear. Want to make a wager ? Fucking shit! - Did you see that ? - Holy crap. - Where's the can? - Just there. There, see. - It's a stick, you moron. - So what ? - Do you have another one? - No. Find another one. - Never, to anyone. - Yes, I swear to you. My mouth is super dry. You're just getting home at this hour? - Where's Javier? - Inside. - Where were you ? - We got lost. Ah, you were lost. Have you lost your sense of direction, Cheo? It was dark and we got turned around. - It was very dark. - Yes that's it. - There is no moon. - No. When you're done with your stories, come in for dinner. Go ahead. - You want some ? - Yes. Save some for the eggs. Are the eggs ready? Are you hungry ? Every time I go to Valdivia, I come back starving. You know what makes you super hungry? What? Studying, smarty-pants. That makes you hungry . - It's not true ? - Yes. It smells good. - Why did you come back so late? - We got lost. Be careful on the roads. Did you tell your mother where you were? She works hard, you can not do that to her. She is so pretty, one must not upset her. I mean seriously. Sorry, but you will not say otherwise, this kid needs a brother. I say it like it is. - Stop, you moron. - What? Where were you ? - In the area. - Seems like you were having fun. - Grandma, I was given this for you. - Thank you honey. You were with Javier's son? Yes. What were you doing ? - Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing ? I am tired. - At this hour ? - Yes. Leave him alone. Go to bed, Cheo. Good night. Come on, hurry up. You never had a girlfriend? The girls are fighting over me. Did not they teach you how to brush your teeth? They like it like that, it's natural. Yes, that's it. Did she call you? Who ? - You want to talk to her ? - No. I don't care. The girls are super hot, here. - Don't pay attention to them. - They're bitches. You want to do them. - No you, you want. - Shut it, bastard. Who are you messing with? You didn't bring anything today. Don't be stupid, give him his things. I'm leaving ! Hi, Mom ? It's not too early. What do you mean ? You send me here and you don't even call me. I know I screwed up. Mom, I want to come home. I'm sick of this fucking little town. Hello? I miss Dani. How is he? You talk like Roberto. You're hanging up on me ? Hello? It's comfortable ? Not really, it's a crappy couch. What, you don't say hello? Hello. - You don't have any homework? - No. So come help me. C'mon. Hurry up. - Start the car. - Me ? Fuck ! There is a cable lying around. Fucking cable. - It's missing the key. - It's in there. - No. - Oh? What did he do with it? Here it is. What? What should I do ? Should I congratulate you or call the cops? - I helped you. - Do you think that's funny? We're going to the beach ? I'm kidding. - Get out. - Okay. It's not funny. - Who taught you that? - The street. I spoke to the lawyer. Three of the people interrogated were denied a fair defense so we have to do something. We will go to the square to protest against... - Again ? - Come on! My friends, stay calm. My brother, do you want to say something? Excuse me, but we have to stop this bullshit. We do too many peaceful actions, Facebook events and we get fucked by the cops. We must be more radical. Like before, Pedro. The danger is always there, whether we act or not. - How many brothers must we lose? - That's not the solution. We will not react like the cops. They will arrest all of us. Exactly, we did not get results, so we have to contact the press, to put pressure... Where is your backpack? I left it at school. Fucking trail... Why do you live so far out? Do you like her that much? You know you want it. - Have you kissed her already? - Do not start. You are dying to adopt this Mapuche. He's a good boy. - He has a difficult life. - Super difficult. He has no friends, he lives in this hole... his father is dead. He is cursed. - Who told you that ? - Cheo. Here, we hear lots of thing. Don't believe everything you're told. That's all very mysterious. Like the mystery of the backpack left at school. She's good, his mother. She'll be crazy about me. Look at her, she's hot. Ow, that hurts. Hello. You look happy. Hello. How are you ? - Hello. - Alejandro. - Tano. - Andrea. - Did you meet Cheo? - Yes, we hang out together. - So ? - He's nice. Here they come. Hi, Cheo. Did it go okay ? - Yes, it was fine. - Oh good. Hello, my beauty. It's Tano. Cheo won't stop talking about him. Want to come with us tomorrow? - Where ? - To the demonstration. Isn't that right, Cheo? Yes, you can come with us. - I'll take you. - Yes, we'll all go together. - I'll think about it. - Oh, come on. In the meantime, I say yes. You are supposed to be punished. C'mon, let's go. The blood of my people My people who fight Who speaks with thunder The sun and the rain In plowing the land they found support The blood of the people Against time This blood is in my body it flows in my veins People who live in the midst of shooting and punishment Men crying Crying over the dead The blood of the people Spread on the ground Hello, my brothers. The government should be ashamed that we, the Mapuches, need to come back here to remind him that these lands belong to us. To remind them that their big projects destroy the essence of Mapuche culture and that we were here long before their ambitions. They destroy the memory of our ancestors and our traditions. We do not want any more raids. We don't want to lose any more children or have brothers forced to hide. Since we are right, we raise our voices and since we raise our voices, we will win. My brothers and sisters, ten times, we will overcome! Ten times, we will win! Your friend won't stop staring at me. What should we do ? Call your mother. - We'll tell her we're going back with Pedro. - He has to go to the police station. It doesn't matter, we'll go there later. Come on, man. Are we friends or not? Don't worry, it'll be great. You're strong. You want some ? We can make a bong. What's that ? Wait, you'll see. - So tell me. - What? You have "Face"? Facebook ? Of course. I have lots of friends who say they "like" me, all that... Everyone follows me, but I'm a nobody. When you leave, will you add me? We'll see. I will put: "Remind me later." Let's see. We're gonna get wasted, man. - Have they returned ? - No. You didn't go with them? No, I had to take care of the kids. They are with Pedro, he'll bring them back. If you want, you can wait here. Okay. Come on in. My lip got stuck when it closed. It tore off a piece of my lip. - No way. - Look. - No. - Look. Okay, I'm looking. Can you see it ? That makes you laugh ? Your kid gets that from you. And from his mother. She was a party girl? We were young. I don't remember. Or you don't want to remember. Or I don't want to tell you. Maybe. Can I have one? Thank you. The other day... Cheo came back after hanging out with Tano, and he smelled like weed. He's not the type, I think it was the first time he had smoked, so I did not ask him anything. Why didn't you tell me? I dunno. - It's so I can sleep well. - Are you having trouble sleeping? It happens. Sometimes I wake up and can't move. I feel like I'm in a coma. - Do you know why it happens to you? - No. It happens to those who act badly and who feel trapped. Maybe. I do not trust anyone. I am always on my guard. Hold on. - What? - Someone's out there. I really heard something. No one's there. - Alejandro? - Shit. Hide. What's the matter ? What are you doing here? - Do you know what time it is? - It's late. Yes, it's late. - What are you laughing at ? - I'm not laughing. What? - Get in the car. - Shut up. You fuck with everyone, you little asshole. - What? - That's why you were kicked out. - Stop showing off. - Get in. - Don't give me orders. - Come here and get in the car. Sorry, it was me who invited him. Sorry. Come on, get in. - Let go of me. - Stop. Let go of me, asshole! Stop your bullshit, I'm your father. Since when, bastard? Since when ? You think that to be a father, all you have to do is get laid? Where were you when they beat me? Where were you ? You were busy being a hippie out here in the bush. You think you are different, but you're just as bad as she is. You showed up, you said what you wanted and afterward, you blamed the little prick. If you lose money, it's the little prick. "We are going to send him far away so that he will leave us in peace. Now, we are happy. We're happy, damn. " Fuck you ! Go to hell. You're shit, just like everyone else. You're a shit, bastard! Whore. Let me go, I want to get out of here! I have a problem with alcohol. Where are you going ? I'm not running away. You okay ? Fran told me that your father was upset. You were really drunk, right? - You think ? - Super drunk. Yeah, really drunk. Do you know "Indian burn"? Do you want to know what it is? You want to play ? Without crying. Okay. You count to 50 and I'll stop when you're done. - Are you ok? - Yes. Go on, count. Louder, that's boring. - It hurts. - Hold on. - I am in pain. - Hold on, this is the game - That hurts me. - It's the game. Count! - Let go of me. - Go on, count. You don't know how to count? - Yes ! - Then go on. - Count. - Let go of me. - Mind your own business. - What's wrong with you ? You want to talk to me ? Go talk to your mother. Tell her to introduce you to your father. Tell her to stop being a cunt. Screw you. Fucking shit! To relax before sleeping. Are you hiding something from me? Do not speak in that tone. What did you hide from me about my father? What can I tell you about your father? Why are you still being a cunt? Pedro, where were you? - How are the kids? - Good. - Good, why? - It's a mess with the cops. We're going to get rid of these fucking Mapuches. Wake up. Bring me Pedro. It's a raid! Cheo, hurry up. Let me go. Where is Pedro? Where are you going, bastard? Come here. He's inside, go for it! Who is still inside? Bastards, get out of my house. What's up ? - Nothing. - You want some ? Thank you. They didn't come, if you're looking for him. - There were cops everywhere. - All the better. They piss everyone off. Here. By the way, tomorrow I will have the house to myself. Pattinson stole a joint from his brother, we are going to smoke it. - You want to come ? - I can't. What are you going to do ? I don't want to come. - You went to the director? - Yes. - You can go. - Thank you. - What happened ? - It's a mess. Let's go. - Fucking cops! - Stop. - What is this mess ? - It's a bunch of bullies. Leave them alone, fucking cops. Asshole killers! We can confirm that it was a murder. The death was caused by short-range shooting with a firearm, a rifle, to be precise. In the community neighborhood, people found the corpse of the 27-year-old Mapuche leader, Pedro Melinao Lican. Neighbors and relatives watched over the body of the leader and demanded the presence of a priest at the location. In exchange, they allowed the police to investigate. Relatives of the victim suspect that police were involved in the murder. It is only the police who pass by this road. It's their route. Many demonstrations denounce the death of the young Mapuche. It is the face of a murderous state that kills the Mapuche people. Ten times, we will win! Ten times, we will win! Today, we are with brothers who come from far away. To share the weight of the pain we feel. We are all together, with our heads held high. In this time of pain, we must find hope. Because for our struggle, death is not an obstacle. A thousand times we will cry: freedom! Ten times, we will win! Go to bed. It's late. - My son. - What? - We can go see him this week. - Who ? Your father. If you want, I can organize it so that we can go to see him. We are good, like this. Good night. Good night. When I was little, I told her to bring me to see you. I wanted to live with you. She got upset. What did she say ? That it had been more than a year since you had called. That you would not call anymore. That I was wasting my time. It made me super sad. Really. But, I thought... that if you died, I would not care. She was right. I was wasting my time. It's nothing. You had the right to think that. Why ? Why did you come back? Yes. See you soon. Who was it ? Social services. She's coming tomorrow. She'll give us a warning, this time. Why are you making that face ? No reason. Do not worry, it's a simple visit. You will have to hold yourself well. PEDRO MELINAO IS WITH US There's a big mess in the gym. Shitty terrorists. It's Cheo who did that. It's Cheo, for sure. A terrorist, like the one they killed. Nutcase, Cheo. - What's your problem ? - What? - It's flying, little Cheo. - Get out, bastard. They are going to beat up Cheo. Shit. Beat me up, bastard. Hit me, asshole! You don't know who you're dealing with. If you touch him, I'll kill you. Defend yourself, bastard. What did we say? It's not his fault. Stop defending him and imitating him. Calm down, Javier. Do you think that will help us for tomorrow? Natalia. He beat up a kid at school, they want to expel him. I can tell you that if they expel him, he gets sent back to you. Why not ? What do you mean ? Where was he sleeping? Got a light ? I've been thinking. I'm going to clean up the floor. I'm going to get rid of some junk. Clean a little. I'm going to change the tables, they're rotten. I say this... because I know you like to go up there. I'm afraid it's falling apart. Tell us. How did it go ? Well... It's not good news. Why do you say that ? Let's say that because of prior problems, everything that happened... I believe it is possible that the court sends Alejandro to a juvenile center. We discussed it very seriously. Alejandro promised to change. - Isn't that right ? - Yes. Things will improve, it will be better. You must know, it's not up to him. How long ? Until you turn 18. How is he doing ? Okay. He's up there, he's not saying anything. Adaptation: Camille Bosc French subtitles: Le Joli Mai English Subtitles: Ahniwa Ferrari
