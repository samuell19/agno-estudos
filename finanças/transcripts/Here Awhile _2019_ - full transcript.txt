Hey. I know I should've called. Hey, Michael, I'm really... I... I'm sorry. I... - Thirsty? - Uh, no, I'm okay. So... - I just... - Thought I didn't give a shit? - I don't know. - Yeah, you didn't know. You sure didn't care. You just took off. - Okay, I had no choice, okay. - Right. - You know what, maybe I should just... - Again? Really? I'm really sorry, Michael. Do you hate me? A little. - You look, um... - Like shit. - Just tired. - Yeah. Oh, well, you look really good. God, you got all grown up and manly. And you're a spitting image of dad. You took after Mom, thank God. Yeah, I guess I did. How long has it been? Way too long. Yeah. Can I try? I saved all your stuff. That was my favorite. Okay. So, wait. How do you eat then? Food carts. - You don't cook like anything? - Nope. - Nothing? - Nothing. Wow. Okay. I'm gonna help you organize. This I gotta see. So... Where'd you go when Dad, um... Threw your abomination lesbian sister out? - God, what an asshole. - Yeah. So after I left, I went down to San Francisco. I actually lived on the streets for almost like two years. On the streets? Like you were homeless? Yeah, I guess. - Whatever. - Jesus. I called home a whole bunch of times. - Really? - Yeah. I called and Dad picked up, and he just hung up every single time. I didn't know. What kind of parent does that? So anyway, I started selling my art on the street, and after a few months, I actually got into a gallery and started making some money. San Francisco, that ain't easy. Yeah, go figure. And then, one day, I met someone in the gallery. She was just visiting from Salt Lake. But we hooked up. And I went back with her to Salt Lake, and that's when I called you. I remember. It was so good to hear your voice that day. I'm so sorry you had to deal with all shit with Dad by yourself. So... What's her name? Luisa. Nice. And we're happy, you know. And we live in a house that we actually own. And I don't steal shit anymore. Ta-da! Why, Michael? Why? Just be here. Yeah, already. It's supposed to be right here. It's always here. Like a puzzle every time. Does it have to be? Just... Who are you? Better question. Who are you and what are you doing in my brother's kitchen? Gary. Next door. Evans. Michael's trusted technical advisor. Okay. Cool. What are you looking for? Sugar. Sugar? - Yes. - Why are you looking for sugar? Michael keeps moving it around. Oh. Why does he keep moving it around? That... Michael, what happened? Tommy? What? - Mrs. Johnson? - Yeah. My name is Anna Miller and this is my little brother Michael, and your son, Tommy, has been bullying him. He beats him up for no reason at all. Get your kid under control, got it? He touches you again, I'm gonna beat the crap out of that little shit. Come on, come on, come on. Hey. Yeah, I'm okay. I am. Sort of. Yeah, yeah, I just got back. Same thing as the doc said in Salt Lake. Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna tell him when he, uh, gets home. I miss you. When are you gonna come? No, that's great. Oh, no, no, no. That's fine. We can just talk about it later. I love you. Okay, bye. Hey. You okay? Um... Not really. What's the matter? Can I talk to you? What's up? Um... Do you... Do you want a drink? No, thanks. I'm... I'm sick. It's something serious? I... I have cancer. It, um... It started last year. And then it just spread all over the place. My... My liver, my lungs, and inside of my belly. So did you have surgery or chemo? It's inoperable. But yeah, I did. I had a few rounds of chemo hell. It just, uh, it got a lot worse. I'm so sorry, Michael. I've been a useless big sister. I know. What am I supposed to say? I mean, if this wasn't happening, would you even be here? So... - Dad? - He died last year. 63, early Alzheimer's. Too much booze and bad genes, I guess. He almost burned the house down a couple times. So I got him into a place, a memory care. Couldn't even recognize me for the last year. Sounds like you've had a rough few years yourself. At times. - So where is he? - Oh, yeah, this way. What a sorry mess he was. Oh, hey. What is all that? - Just stuff from house. - Really? Oh, wow. - Can I, uh... - Sure. Knock yourself out. Yeah, maybe tomorrow. Yeah. Let me know if you find any treasure I might've missed. - Anna? - Yeah. I'm okay. I'll be out in a bit. - You're going in the bedroom. - No, Michael. I'm fine on the couch. No, you're not. End of story. Sips. Cola? It's good for nausea. Gary's aunt told me. Okay, where is it this time? And where is Michael? Uh, which question would you like for me to answer first? Why are you being so complicated? So, Anna, it appears you've now met Gary for the second time, I guess. Yes, Gary-next door-Evans. - You've met my sister, Anna. - Yes, also, for the second time. And she obviously is quite the smarty pants. Gary, nobody says smarty pants any more. - My aunt does. - Oh, right, your aunt. Of course, she's bringing it back. Hey, Gary, wait up. So, uh, what do you do? I work on AI at Face Check. - AI? - Artificial Intelligence. Really? As opposed to, like, real intelligence. Facial feature recognition analysis. Your face can reveal some very interesting information about you. Really? Like what? - You want to see a demo? - I don't think that's a good idea. No, come on. Why not? Okay. Okay. Okay, don't move. Okay. Okay, just hold still. Okay. - Okay, ready? - Mm-hmm. - Right there. Don't move. - Oh, my God. - Okay, there's two more coming. - OK, thank you. - Okay, there's one more coming. - Okay. No moving. Very good. You're a lesbian. What? AI Facial Feature algorithms. Oh, okay, awesome, algorithms. Oh, there's more. There's some kind of problem. Oh, um, so being a lesbian isn't enough? No, I mean another kind of problem. Not that being a lesbian is a problem, because, you know, sexual orientation is something you're born with. Program has glitches. I should get going. Okay. Well, it was really nice to see you again, Gary-next door-Evans. Goodbye Anna smarty pants. Does he come over often? Two or three times a day. I kind of look out for him. In a way. He's had the Asperger's, OCD, agoraphobia, and some other stuff. Oh, no shit. Agoraphobia? Okay, so what's up with like, that thing? It's a ritual behavior. He's afraid if he doesn't do that before he leaves, someone would die or something horrible would happen to them. Hmm. And... And the sugar thing? I worked it out with his aunt, not to buy him sugar. That way he comes over, I make sure he's okay, he's taking his meds. You know, like with Dad, I always made sure he took his meds, and, you know. Wow. You're... Hey. What's up? I just wish that I could have been there. You were there for me early on. And I remember it all. Because that's why it hurt, when you left. But look, here you are. Yeah. Here we are. Oh, my God. Are you kidding me? Oh, come on. Come on, babe. Work with me, babe. Work with me. What's this? "Death with dignity." - When were you planning to share this? - Let me explain. Okay. So, given my situation and what's up ahead, I wanna go on my own terms, you know. You understand, right? No. I don't. So what does this mean? Like it says, I have to have a written request, signed by me and two witnesses. And then I have to have two doctors confirm that request on two separate occasions, 15 days apart. And one of the doctors knows my clinical situation, and is the prescriber of the special medicine. And then the other doctor has to agree based on my situation. You don't even have a doctor here. Actually, I do. I saw her yesterday and she's sending me to a specialist in a few days. - It says that you have to be a resident of Oregon. - I got that yesterday. You can't do this, Anna. This is really hard for me. And I need your support. You want to commit suicide in my house, and you need my support? - Really? Wasn't Mom enough? - Okay. - Now, that's not fair. - No, you don't lay down. You fight this. - Are you kidding me? - You don't get the show up, make nice, smooth it all over with me and then just off yourself. So, so like what? You... You're planning on dying here? You maybe wanna die in my room, on my bed. Is that your plan? I... Hey, Gary. Hi. - Do you need anything else? - No. About the other day, when I revealed your secret. Secret? Being a lesbian. That's not actually a secret. But there's something else. It's not a program glitch, like I said before. Okay. Are you ill? Uh... Yeah. I knew it. So, what is it? I think you have a pretty serious health issue. I see. - And you can tell this from your algorithms. - Yes. You should probably go see a doctor. Okay. You may even have something bad. You could even have cancer. You know, Gary. I actually do have cancer. See, I knew it. Yeah, I have, um... I have seen the doctors, and I've had all tests. So you're getting chemo, radiation, - all the cancer stuff? - I did. But now it's just too far gone. A friend had a dog who had cancer, and he died. - Hi, Michael. - Hey. Anna told me. What? She has cancer. Too far gone. Cancer. Okay. - Did you get your sugar? - Yes, I did. Thank you. So we'll be seeing you later then. I'm pretty sure that means you want me to leave? You're getting better at this, Gary. Thank you. Good bye, Anna. Sorry about your cancer. Thanks, Gary. I'd do all the thoughts and prayers thing, but I'm an atheist. So, you know, just good luck. What's this? Called a friend of mine last night who works at the university hospital. He helped me find these. Three clinical trials for inoperable, metastatic colon cancer. Now, I don't understand all the details, but at least there's a chance. You know, one of them could work. These are from clinicaltrials. gov, right? Yeah. Okay. These two are phase one trials, and a phase one trial tests the safety and dosage of the new drug, and bottom line is you feel like shit and you still die quickly. This is a phase three trial. And phase three trials tests how the new drug works compared to standard treatment. And people who got the new drug lived about two and a half months longer, and they still have pretty awful side effects. Well, there's gotta be something else. Yeah, there are clinical trials that aren't actually documented online. - Okay, So... - So, Luisa and I contacted all of the major cancer centers in the country, and we sent over my clinical records, and we actually ended up talking to some of the docs at these places. And that was a small miracle in itself. Us little mortals actually speaking with the Gods in their world. So, do understand now? This is a chance, right? - At least you could live longer. - It's not living. You don't get to decide that. Crazy shit miracles happen all the time. There is no miracle coming. Okay. This is my life, what's left of it. And I got one move left, and I am making it. And I need your support on this. Can you do that? - It's just can't. - Fuck. Hey there, buddy. Long time no see. You are a princess. And I'm a frog. - Now you gotta kiss the frog. - No, no, no, no. - It's just not right. - Says who? She won't even consider the clinical trial. I don't blame her. I wouldn't wanna be a guinea pig in her state either. Okay, how about this, after she commits suicide... Oh, my God. You can't call it that. Okay. After she does the death with dignity thing of ending her life in my bed, how am I supposed to even sleep in that bed? Michael, I know that this is really hard for you... I don't think I can even stay in this house. Well, you know, you could always, um, moving with Gary. - Not funny, Shonda. - Yeah, and you're not making any sense. So... Hey, you're awake. How're you feeling? Okay. Hi, I'm Shonda. Michael has told me a lot of really good things about you, and also some really sad things. Anyways, I wanted the two of you guys to meet. - Okay. - I gotta get to work. Okay. So, I, uh... I guess Michael told you everything. Yeah, pretty much. I know, I'm late. Working on a very special project. Got a bit complicated. All righty, then. Yeah. Right. Almost. Mm. Later. Bye. Damn, Gary. So chatty this morning. No, I'm not. - That's what I meant. - But that's not what you... Oh, I get it. I'll take one of those. I gotta go. - Yeah. - Sarcasm. Bye, Gary. - Yeah, bye. - Bye, Gary. - You have a great day now. - Bye Anna smarty pants. I'm gonna miss you, Gar-bear. - Ha-ha. - Don't be gone too long. - See you later. - Bye. - Don't forget about me, Gar-bear. - Bye. - We love you. - Bye. See you soon. Gary. He's so sweet in this like, awkward sort of way. The sweetest, most awkwardest way possible. - Oh, before I forget. - Mm-hmm. Lemon haze. - Nice. - Yeah. Helps with the nausea and pain, and dealing with fabulous stuff like that. Yeah, I was actually gonna pick some up. - But how much do I? - Duh-uh. Nothing. And Michael has my number, so, if you need anything, just call, okay? Hmm. And, hey, I know that he's struggling with, you know. Uh, but I'm gonna keep working with him. Thank you. Oh, man. Okay. Let's see what you can do. What's up? - Just a little... - Can I get you something? Oh. Good, she remembered. She's really nice. I'm glad you guys are, you know... Whatever. Oh, wow. You were nine months old. She looks happy. Probably 'cause you didn't poop your pants during the photo. "Dear Mom. "We're so happy you're home from the hospital." Do you remember when we put this - next to her on the bed when she got home? - Yeah. She just camped out in that bed. Crying all the time. Gosh. She must have been hurting so bad. I actually remember thinking, I must've done something really bad to make her feel so awful. Do you remember that book we made? With all of the wonderful things in the world worth living for. I think I used up two boxes of crayons as the official illustrator. She was never the same after that first time. I guess she got it right the second time. I'm just so confused, you know. I was like, what, ten or eleven. You were... 15. She was just... So selfish. So, do you think I'm being selfish? We all have some pain we have to live with, don't we? You haven't been in my shoes, Michael. And, don't worry. Luisa and I will find another place, so we don't bother you. Wow. What's all this stuff? Oh, uh, just some stuff that Michael saved from the house. Oh, shit. That hurts. - That the cancer stuff? - Yeah. That's the cancer stuff. Webster Online Dictionary defines death as the end of life. Dignity as a formal reserve or respect, and reserve can mean forbearance from making a full explanation. I think the end of your life deserves respect. Even if it's an answer I don't understand. You're an angel, Gary. I don't actually believe angels exist. Well, I do. Hmm. Who is it? Oh. Oh, my God. - Oh, I missed you so much. - I missed you too. How are you? - I'm okay. - Yeah? I'm better now. It's so, so good to see you. Hi, Luisa. Michael. Nice to meet you. You too. - I'm good. I'm good. Come on in. - Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anna tells me you work in IT. I do network security stuff. Ah. You know, Michael's actually a manager. Hmm. We should be out of here in a couple of days. Yeah, we, uh, found a place. - You... You can stay longer. - Oh, really? And just how long would that be? Oh, you know what, thanks, Michael, but we're gonna be okay. What's all that? Oh, that's just some stuff, uh, from the house that Michael saved after our dad died. Anna's poems. Our work, teddy bears. Yep. You did save Buddy. Sure did. Hey. I have an idea. - You're doing great. - Yeah. Yes. Better? Yes. Getting better. Hey, Gary? What's your preference? Computer Networks Security, or advanced C++ programming? Advanced C++ programming. Hey, do we really need all that video equipment? A few small essentials, that's all. So we get a couple of shots with a cell phone. That would not be appropriate. You may think your dad as a waste of protoplasm, - but... - Wait. Did I actually say that? - Yes, - Protoplasm? Well, sort of. I have never said protoplasm in my life. I drew a conclusion. You often get stuck in an infinite loop - of disparaging comments about him. - Oh. Right. You're right. Why are we doing this? I heard that, Michael. And you know why? Go on. Say it. - Do I have to? - Yes. Resolution and forgiveness. Very good. - How are we doing, buddy? - Almost. Almost. We're not shooting a feature. You can't scrimp on memories. Yeah, you can't scrimp on memories. Do you remember what to say? Yes. Okay. Five, four, three, two, one, go. We are gathered here in this beautiful place to say farewell to our father, Theodore Samuel Miller. He tried. That's it. We want to memorialize his parting in this great place of nature. Dear lovely death, that taketh all things under wing, never to kill, only to change into some other thing. This suffering flesh, to make it either more or less. Yet not again the same. Dear lovely death, change is thy other name. Cut. We got it. Gary, that was above and beyond. Really. I just never get a chance. You're so damn good at it. Hey, guys, I have another idea. Uh-oh. Why don't we all go to the beach tomorrow, you know. The weather is supposed to be beautiful, and Gary can take some more videos. It's a great idea. Gary, does that work for you? Um, wow. There's a lot of people walking and looking and breathing. - Mostly breathing. - Well, the ones walking and looking, would most likely be breathing as well. I'm pretty sure you want me to say okay. Okay. But I'll bring the smaller camera, and maybe we could use the Lavaliers, but I don't think we need the reflectors. Oh, Gary, I thought I did a pretty good job with the reflector. Mm, in that setting, we should be okay. No amazing reflectors needed, Luisa. Sarcasm. Wow. What a collection. If only they did some magic. So did the doc say anything about chemo, clinical trials, anything? Yeah, the same. Babe. Cannabidiol. This is a, uh... a cannabis derivative, and it treats the nausea, anxiety and paranoia. - Paranoia? - Yeah. That's right. Paranoia. You got a problem with paranoia, huh? - Stop. You're freaking me out. - Oh, I guess it's not working. And... Fucoidan. Fuck a... Fuck a Dan? What the hell? - No. It's pronounced as... - What the hell? Who is Dan? Fucoidan. And it is a brown seaweed derivative. And it is something that kills cancer cells. Oh, so that's a good thing, right? That's a good thing. We got little dancing Dans in there dancing around killing cancer cells. Oh, God. Oh, I'm gonna shit myself to death. - What do you need? - A new gut. A new life with you from the start. Hmm. Whoa. (SNIFFS) Sorry. Lavender. - I'm... I'm thinking lavender. - Liar. How you feeling now? A little better. You're seeing the doctor again next week? Yeah, we're gonna finalize everything and then, we're gonna get the medicine. Hey. I'm okay. Okay. Will Rachael be there? Please stop talking about that. What's wrong, buddy? Well, like I just don't know if... if like she wants me to kiss her or like if we should hold hands. Michael, don't worry. It'll all work out. It'll be a little clumsy when it first happens, but, it'll work out. Just be a gentleman. And the most important part about being a gentleman, is being gentle. Trees, grass, shrubs, trouts, mushrooms. Shrubs, grass, shrubs, shrubs. - Bunch of shrubs. - You good, Gar? Yes, I am. Shrubs, more shrubs. So it's not the open air that bothers you? No, it's just people. Bodies and eyes, smells. - But you're breaking my concentration. - Oh, sorry. Shrubs, shrubs. Ladies, okay? Anyone need a pit stop? I'm good. - It's amazing. - Yes. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna put music in this, Michael. - Sure. That'd be great. - Okay. Really, Gary. Thanks for doing this. It means a lot. It means a lot. A lot of what? - You're good, bud. - I think so. I feel okay. Wow. Oh, Gary. That was beautiful. Thanks. Thanks. I was, uh, 11 or 12, and, uh, 6:00 a.m. And I'm in the kitchen, and I'm like, sketching or something. And I look up, and I'm all like, "Michael." Don't tell this story. He is sleep-peeing into a garbage can. Michael. What is that? This is a fidget cube. It helps dissipate anxiety. I have a condition called obsessive compulsive disorder. And I have to do things in sets of prime numbers. - Oh. - Yes, when it's really bad, I'll flip the light switch 23 times, or wash my hands 17 times. - Damn. - But when my medication is right, I can get it down to three. Usually. But what, what about one? One's prime, right? No, I don't like one. One is no good. What do you think happens when we die? I don't know. You can't even look to religion. They all have different explanations too. I'm sure that religions evolved because they were critical to humans addressing the rapidly growing anxiety we were developing as part of our psyche over the millennia. - Yeah. - Yeah. All animals have anxiety essential to brain function as alerting mechanisms for potential danger... hunger, pain. So basically, we take drugs for anxiety to quell our fear of saber toothed tigers. Yes, yes. Or any other number of horrible things, like, meeting deadlines, or a boss that is an absolute idiot, or a bad review at work, or being around people, all breathing and sweating, and talking all at the same time. That's a whole shitload of insight I've never heard for you before. Well, perhaps these challenging couple of weeks have been more therapeutic for me than all the chemicals I've been ingesting at the recommendation of doctors. Perhaps I should just throw them all away, and be free. The free concept is great. But I don't think you should get off your meds for now. We can work in stages. That'd be better, right? Yes. That would be smarter. I think we go somewhere, where our loved ones are waiting for us to join them. Pets too? Definitely pets. I like that. But what if you don't like them? My Uncle Geoffrey was a jerk. So I die, I walk through the white light or wherever, and then I'm around Patches and Ruff Ruff, and Uncle Geoffrey for eternity? I honestly don't know what's gonna happen. But I don't think that this is it. I wonder... ...high school. Yeah, my senior. - Your poems are like really good. - Right? Thank you. - Ah! - Ah-ha! - We all have to make a toast. - Hmm. All right. - Wow, babe. - That's good for me. Here's to life, and all of its messy complications. Cheers. Okay. Here's to finding the love of your life when you least expect it. And when you think you didn't deserve it. And to my sister. Who ran away, and built the beautiful life she deserved. So happy you came back. I would have come back sooner, if you had just showered more. I'll have you know that his shower situation has greatly improved. - Hmm. - He gets his back washed every now and then. None of that talk around my sister. You just smell really good. - Sugar man is back. - Gary to the rescue. - Hey, Gary. - Gary, just in time for your toast. What toast? Vodka or vodka. Oh, I... - My... - Vodka it is. Okay. - Oh, my God. - Mm-hm. Wow. Very strong. You don't have to take it all in one shot. You just have to make a toast about something you really care about. Yeah. Come on, Gar-bear, you got this. Maybe I'll take a little sip just to help me think. Oh. Oh! Oh! Why do people drink this? Just think of it as like antiseptic. - Hmm. - Kill all the nasty germs in your mouth. - I don't think I have nasty germs. - Anytime, Gar, anytime. Okay. Okay. I got one. - Here's to my Acer Predator... - No, no, no, no, no. Cheers! It can't be about any inanimate stuff. It's a very good picture, and its vivid. Something that... Something that involves humans. Actual humans... Okay. Here's to... family. - Nice. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. I love that. Oh, cheers, cheers, cheers! Cheers. Ow and wow. Ow and wow. Ow and wow. Oh. Oh, I'm glad there's no open flames, because I'm pretty sure my face would catch on fire right now. Okay, so you gonna, you gonna pass on this? Oh, keep that a million miles away. For now. Forever, Anna smarty pants. Come in. How are you doing? - I've been better. - You need anything? A new body. What's that? Oh, my God, your poems. I guess the old man didn't toss them. - They're beautiful. - No, they're not. It's just a bunch of stupid teenage staff. Stop it. "I don't wanna be the last bad thought recalled "Nor some dredge of circumstance at which to be appalled "Let me be a free spirit "A breeze of life in your weary mind "Something that once lost "You may again be pleased to..." Oh, God, I don't feel good. Here she is. Your sis. Anna, the artist. Wow. Anna's showing in two galleries in Utah, and still a couple in San Francisco. These are amazing. Thanks. It's fun while it lasted. So, Dr. Davis, this is my brother Michael. - Hi. - And his friend Shonda. - Hi. - And this is my girlfriend, Luisa. It's very good to meet you all. So do we need to sign something again? Uh, no. Uh, your documentation is all in order. I do need to ask you, um... I need to verify one more time whether or not this is really something you wanna do. It is. And you've spoken to your specialists, and they have talked to you about clinical trials? He did. And you're not interested? Interested? Sometimes we see surprising results. Yes. I have heard that. Uh, I have also heard about the side effects. And I don't wanna die in a hospital with IVs and tubes and monitors. I wanna be able to say goodbye with a clear head to the people that I love. And I want them there with me, when I... Wherever. Yeah. Okay. So there are a couple of pills that you're going to need to take before you take the main medicine, so you don't throw that up. And you'll need to empty the contents of 100 capsules into a glass and mix it with water or juice. And you're gonna wanna drink that down, fairly quickly, and you're gonna wanna keep that down. Okay? Um, there, uh, there's a lot of people who... who never fill the prescriptions. And there's some who do, and they never... They never take the medicines. You need to know that you can change your mind at any time. Okay? I know. Okay. Thank you. So I just, uh, I wanna say thank you so much for coming to my office on time. Uh, so, Dr. Davis said that I have to empty all of these 100 capsules, and mix it with that. And I have to just knock it back really fast, and then keep it down. So, no problemo. Oh. Gary. Hey. It's okay. Will you stay? I want you to. If you want to. I wouldn't miss it for the world. I can't believe I just said that. That was some disgusting shit. You wanna go lie down? Not quite yet. I, uh... I wanna say a few things first. Michael... I'm so sorry... that I didn't have the courage to reconnect with you after so long. But I'm really glad that I did. Thank you for being so loving, and so forgiving. Shonda. Thank you for being like a sister to me in the short time that I've known you. And I, I really hope that you can share your warm heart with my little brother for very a long time. Gary. You might be the smartest, kindest, funniest guy that I've ever known. And thank you for letting me in. And Luisa, the love of my life... Oh. I will always be with you. Thank you for saving me. And for loving me. Oh, God. Okay. Oh. I just, I wanna... I just wanna share a little poem... from Mary Lee Hall. It's called Turn Again To Life. "If I should die, and leave you here awhile "Be not like others sore undone who keep "Long vigils by the silent dust "For my sake "Turn again to life, and smile "Nerving thy heart and trembling hand "To do something to comfort other hearts than mine "Complete these dear unfinished tasks of mine "And I, perchance, may therein "Comfort you." It's time. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. You okay? Yeah. I love you. I'm here. I love you too.
