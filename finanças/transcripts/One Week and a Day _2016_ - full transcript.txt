The last day of the Shiva of Vicky and Eyal's son. Shiva: a week of mourning in the Jewish tradition following the funeral. You OK? - Yeah. Who wants to get whipped? See you there? Bye, sweetie. Vicky? There he is. Come on. Hey, how's it going? Where's Vicky? Is it OK that we came now? We brought a salad. The Shiva ended so you came? He's crazy. - Come. No, I'm not going. I told you we shouldn't have come. Let's go? Vicky. - Sorry. Long time. It's been too long. We've gotta go. Are you coming to the 'grave visit'? We can't. - But we brought a salad. I don't eat cucumbers. It's OK. Thanks. We've got to head out to the grave. Let's go? Well, I hope you won't know anymore grief. -We will, we will. Fuck 'em. And in Eilat, from 32 degrees tonight to 03. I think I'll stay home. You're what? There are break-ins. They look at the obituaries and when the families are at the cemetery they break into their houses. When Shamir died they broke into his daughter's house. Are you stupid? I'll clean up a bit. Can I help you? My son forgot... we forgot... a blanket here. Did you see it? It's colorful. Blue, green, orange, yellow, pink? Patient's name: Ronnie Spivak MEDICINAL CANNABIS You want it? It's yours. And the blanket? Can I get you anything? Yogurt, something? You need anything? Eyal! I'm so happy you're here! How's mom? You want me to introduce you to him? He's nice, but he's not... Ronnie. Did you happen to see Ronnie's blanket? The blue, green, orange, yellow, pink one? Yes. No. Hey, Eyal! What... What are you doing here? Is everything OK? He's looking for Ronnie's colorful blanket. Did you see it? It's blue, green, orange, yellow, pink. I'll look for it. But it's very hard to find something here after... I'll call you if I find it. Put it in your pocket so they won't see you leaving with it. That's what my mom's cousin does when he comes by and takes a bit for himself. I guess your cousin's thinner than me. You've really put on some weight. How about switching lanes? Hey! Keep your eyes on the road! I'll keep them wherever I want. Eyal? Yes? Hello. This is a phone call from your dentist's office. You have an appointment for a dental hygienist and dentist tomorrow afternoon at 51:5 PM. To confirm, press 1. To cancel, press 2. Vicky! Vicky! Vicky! Hi. Wait a sec. I brought you guys some Sushi. Your parents already brought us a salad. But this is from me. Thanks. What? Can I come in? - Why? To sit Shiva. The Shiva ended, Zooler. Thanks. I'm 5 short, I'll go inside and get some cash. Get the money and you'll get the bag. You got 5? 5 what? Shekels. What for? To pay the taxi outside. Why did you take a taxi? I didn't want to drive. Isn't that just a waste of money? Yeah, and the meter's running. Where were you? We forgot the blanket at the hospice. So, where is it? I didn't find it. Count it at home. You owe me anothero1. Receipt? Give me the bag. Hey! Loser! Asshole! Go get a life! Idiot! They'd throw his blanket away. That's why you skipped the 'grave visit'? I stayed to guard the house. Besides, what does it matter? - What does it matter? He's not going anywhere. He'll be there tomorrow, the blanket won't be. The blanket isn't there now. But I didn't know that when I went there, right? Did you see the kittens in the garden vase? -Yeah. We should call the city council to catch and sterilize her. No, don't touch them. If you get near them, the mom won't touch them, won't feed them, nothing. Don't touch them, don't call the city. So what? In a few months we'll have more kittens there. Fine, they'll handle the rats, snakes. What will I do with them tomorrow? Give them a pop quiz. No, that's not fair. What will you do? I didn't plan anything. I think I'll just go there and... I don't know. I'll go in the morning... maybe I'll count inventory. Keren and Shmulik Zooler, will you stop! Enough is enough! Hey, wait! Hold on a second! Hey! I need to buy something. We'll open again in 7 hours. No, I need to buy something now. You're Hila, right? You went to elementary school with my son. Maybe junior high too, I'm not sure. Send him my best. Ronnie Spivak. Thanks. It's stuffy. The other cord. Those Zoolers... like rabbits, huh? The day after the Shiva. Do you remember to take care of the burial plots? Do you remember? They asked that we take care of it by the end of the day. Eyal? What? Eyal? Do you remember? Yeah. -Do you have Yudah's phone number? -Yeah. You look good with a beard. And I look good without one. Come on... Bye. Bye. Hello? It's... It's Spivak. - Yes? Spivak. 51 Shavey Tziyon Street. He's on his way. He should've been here by now. He left 5 minutes ago. Why isn't he here? Look to your right, he'll be there in a moment. What? All good? What are you waiting for? A taxi. Wanna lift? Don't say I didn't offer. - Ronnie Spivak- Hi, it's Eyal. Eyal Spivak. I want to ask you something. So if you could drop by for a second... Bye. Thanks. Bye. Hi. Good morning. - Good morning. Can I ask you a favor? Yeah, of course. Yeah. I can hear the two of you from Ronnie's bedroom. Hear what? You two... What, what do you mean? I mean I hear you two fucking. From his bedroom. OK... So suddenly now it bothers you? Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. What... who are you? I'm the substitute teacher. Guy. Thank you, but I'm here now. Good morning everyone. - Good morning. Vicky? - What? I'm supposed to be here now. Just a moment. Excuse me, if you have a problem, you can go talk to Daphna, OK? Really, thanks for everything, but I'm here now. And I even prepared a pop quiz. You didn't tell us that you're coming back. I'm not sure if it's important or not, but I understood that pop quizzes aren't allowed. Should I go back in? - No. -No. I can't kick him out now. That's it? That's why you took me aside for? Now that I know you want to come back, then... tomorrow? If anyone's looking for me, tell them I'm in the back counting inventory, OK? Wait, you're here? You're in the back? No... But if anyone calls, say that I'm there. But no one's expecting you here today. Alright! But if anyone calls - that's what you'll say. Don't shout... Zooler. That's me. I didn't order sushi. Yeah, but I can't just leave work in the middle of the day. It's enough for a platoon. You wanted me to come. What did you want? One roll would have done. You know, there's a minimum order for takeaway. Shut the door. Say, you still got... the ping-pong table downstairs? So what... what'd you want? Never mind, you want me to whip you up in ping-pong? Hold on a sec. It keeps falling out. Where's this from? I can't keep it inside the rolling papers. Can you show me how you... do it? Now? Then when? I don't know, you never smoked before? Come on, not even when you were my age? Teach me. Be a neighbor. It's medicinal, huh? I can't, I gotta get back to work. I'm not gonna teach you how to roll joints now, Spivak. Sarah from Katzenelson Street couldn't hear you. You know what my dad would do to me? And to you? You nuts? What will he do? Are you a child? Don't be like your dad, Zooler. Zooler! And we'll play ping-pong? But later. Albert, you won't believe it. Some motherfucker crashed into me. Yeah... No... it was a hit and run, it's a nation of assholes. What can I say, Albert, I hope it's the last time it happens. I'm not... OK, whatever, yeah... My dad's taking me to the hospital. I left it at me parent's house. Listen, Albert, I'm really sorry. Talk with Eitan. He always complains that you don't give him enough shifts. Cool. No, it's all internal, a bit of blood on the arm, I'm lucky I had a helmet on. Yeah... Yeah... Yeah, I'm at the hospital, I'm already inside. Everyone's sick here. Albert, I'm going in to see the doctor now. OK, bye. I'm really sorry. When will it kick in? Can I ask you a question? Why aren't you friends with my parents anymore? Your parents are whores, Zooler. Your mom's a zero and your dad's a bitch. When he got sick, they suddenly stopped inviting us over. They stopped answering our calls, slowly, so we wouldn't notice. They stopped being our friends, and that's it. And why did you guys stop being friends? 'Cause when you're in 9th grade, it's not cool having a friend in 6th grade. When will it kick in? It will, it will, just relax a bit. Come, Zooler. Zooler, come! It's a pleasure smoking with you. Zooler! Hi, ma'am. We need to return it. I'm not returning it. I don't want it here. It's ours. We inherited it. What's he doing here? He's rolling. He's helping me roll the joints. Go home, Zooler. - Zooler, stay. Zooler, go home! - Zooler, sit down. Down, sit, roll! Go get a dog. Sit. You said we'd play ping-pong. We said we'd go back. You didn't go yesterday, we said we'd go back today. Why aren't you at work? Why aren't you at work? - I have a break. I wanted to rest a bit at home. We said we'd go back. - So we said. Bring the ashtray with you. Vick... I'm so sorry. Get the fuck out of my face, Zooler. Where are you going? We need to authorize this. I'm good with this.

Yes? What? Hello? Woo... Fuck. Hi, Gal. I forgot. We scheduled a lesson for today, right? What did you do to him? What did you do to him? What did he do to you? - I didn't do anything. Tell her.

That's just our stupid neighbor. Come on. - I think I want to go home. Come on. - I think I want to go home. Maybe you should stay with me anyway? Come. Any pizza bites? I'm allergic to sesame seeds. How's school? Hold a sec, I'm coming. What... What?! What... What?! Stop it! What are you doing here? Continue this outside Or at your house, Shmulik. Your husband hit my wife. - What?! I slapped her. No, no. Stop it! Stop, stop... Enough! What's he doing here? What are you doing here? Why aren't you at work? - He had an accident. I helped him. It's all internal, I'm OK. Where's the helmet I bought you? It's here. We're going, the Shiva is over. Stop it! Enough! Son of a bitch! You scared me. How did you get in? - What? From the roof.

Have you gone crazy? Yes, I've gone crazy. Me. Shmulik? Tell Keren the salad was tasty. I made it. Then it was tasty. What are you doing? Showing you. So, how was it? How was what? How was I? As someone jumping around and pretending to play the guitar? Yeah. Do you think there's a chance to win the air guitar world championship? I don't know how the others are. OK, but based on what you saw. Not bad. Yeah? Yeah. Do you mind not throwing your clothes around? Where's the bag? Remember I filmed you two performing 'You Can Call Me Al'? Oh yeah, when we did Simon and Garfunkel? No, it was only Simon. Ronnie was Simon and I was Garfunkel. You were Chevy Chase, it was after they broke up. I was Garfunkel. You were Chevy Chase and Ronnie was Simon. Really? - Yeah. Remember? Don't know. You wanna see it? We don't have a VCR. I've got one! I mean, my parents have one. Come on! Come on! Can you stop hanging around with my son? Why, is he grounded? I know what you're going through... - Zooler, spare me your bullshit. The kid's running on the rooftops with a VCR. Enough. He's not a kid anymore. - True, but he's mine. What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't you want to see the video? Where you going? - To the hospice. What's a hospice? - You don't know what a hospice is? You want me to come with you? - Your dad wants you at home. Don't be like my dad. Where's that from? The private collection. Hey, Vicky! - Hi, Vicky! Hi. -Hi. What's up? - Since when do you smoke? I don't, it's hers. Are you OK? Yeah, why? Because of Guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. He told us after you left that he was uncomfortable doing it, but he didn't have a choice because it's his job. 'Income', that's what he said. - Income... Oh, right. He said he had no choice because it's his income. -I understand. How was the quiz? What quiz? Hello? Yes? -Vicky Spivak? - Yes. Hi, I'm calling from the dentist's office. -Yes? Your appointment started 51 minutes ago... Oh, shit. - I'll need to reschedule. Hello? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll be there in 7-5 minutes. No, no, no, no... Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes... For once you'll wait for me. Hi, I have an appointment to the hygienist. -There's also a line. No, I'm already late. Spivak? -Right. I told you on the phone that... But I told you... Who's my hygienist? Who's my hygienist? Who's my hygienist? Please, who's my hygienist? Vicky? - Yes. Great, I've been waiting for you. No, no, no! Excuse me! Noa first, and only after that... Did you find the blanket? I told you I'd call when I find it. But you didn't call. - Cause I didn't find it! Vitamin C? What? Who are you here with? Who are you here with? My mom, and you? Eyal Spivak. Really? He's my best friend's dad. Oh yeah? Mine too. So how come I haven't seen you here? No, like when I was your age. So why didn't you visit? How do you know I didn't? I would've seen you. Why are you guys here? Eyal's looking for Ronnie's blanket. He hasn't found it yet? I guess not. I don't know, maybe he did. What was that thing you were doing? I was playing. On what? A guitar. What guitar? The fact that you can't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. You're just not open-minded enough. Oh come on, what are you doing? I told you, I'm practicing, playing for world peace. Why are you laughing? Listen, if everyone will carry an air guitar, they won't carry rifles, cool? But you're not carrying anything! Did you come to put me down? I can go back home for that, thanks. I'm just trying to understand. There's nothing to understand, you just need to try. How are you, Eyal? Let's talk. How are you? - Good, good. Actually, not so good. You guys lost Ronnie's blanket. So maybe you could at least give me some more weed? A prescription or something? Where's the Mrs.? We deserve it. I deserve it. I'm sorry, Eyal. What are you sorry for? You're supposed to ease pain. The patient's pain. I'm not healthy. You're not sick either. I want you to know: I'm completely against this. And I'm completely for it. - That's because you're stupid. What's your problem? What? We do the surgery, go to the beach, release the cancer in the sea, bring the girl back here, eat falafel - no cucumber for you. A little ping-pong, a smoke, straight to bed. Fucking great day! Why? Let's go before she comes out. Dr. Eyal, Dr. Zooler. I spoke to the patient- she's ready for surgery. And we got the OK to take you to the beach after? We got the OK. - Great. Thanks. Keep it in for a minute, all right? 'Did you take care of the burial plots?' Fuck. You've reached Yudah. Please don't leave a voice message. A text message will do. Yudah, Eyal Spivak. We buried our son with you a week ago, Ronnie Spivak. Call me back ASAP, I need to reserve the burial plots next to him. Two, bye. Two plots. You've reached... Wait for me here. You've reached... Is that him? Wait here. Wait here. Why aren't you answering your phone? Remind me? Spivak. Eyal Spivak. Where were you yesterday? You told my wife we can save the plots next to our son. Now there's some Meirav there. I told you we need to finalize it during the first week. We need to bury people, buddy. Are you kidding me? We need to bury people. Hey... What...? What are you doing?! - Zooler, move! What are you doing?! - Get out of my way, Zooler! What are you doing? 'From where you came and where you are going, 'To a place of dust, maggots and worms; 'And before whom you are destined to give judgment and accounting, 'Before the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. 'Great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. 'Your eyes are open to the ways of all mankind; 'You reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve. 'The Lord is just, 'My rock, in whom there is no wrong. 'The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; 'May the name of the Lord be praised. 'Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. 'Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath. 'May His great name be exalted and sanctified is God's great name.' -Amen. 'In the world which He created according to His will. 'May He establish His kingdom and may His salvation blossom and His anointed be near. 'During your lifetime and during your days and during the lifetimes of all the House of Israel, 'Speedily and very soon! And say, Amen.' -Amen. 'May His great Name be blessed forever and ever. 'May His great Name be blessed forever and ever. 'Blessed, praised, glorified, exalted, extolled, 'Mighty, upraised, and lauded be the Name of the Holy One. Blessed is He. 'Beyond any blessing and song, praise and consolation 'That are uttered in the world. And say, Amen.' -Amen. 'May there be abundant peace from Heaven and life upon us... Let's get out of here. - 'And upon all Israel.' I also want to stay. - 'And say, Amen.' 'He Who makes peace in His heights, may He make peace, 'Upon us and upon all Israel. And say, Amen.' -Amen. Meirav, my little sister. I'll never forget the day you were born. I was in 1th grade and Naomi was already in the army. We arrived to the hospital to visit mom, to see our newborn sister. We stood across from the big window, watching the babies just born, and waited for the nurses to show us ours. In the meanwhile we observed the other babies and one stood out with the peace and magic that surrounded her. We couldn't imagine that she is our sister as she looked like a different make. And how happy we were when we found out it was you. In your last days in the hospital, I remember sitting by your bed, holding your hand, caressing your face after the car accident that injured you when you were 6, even then you showed courage and calmness, which helped us all remain calm. I also won't forget the day you called me, one weekend, a year and a half ago and told me straight forward and simply: 'Rafael, I have cancer.' I felt like 1 tons fell on me and I couldn't say a word. Throughout the entire time, from the beginning of the illness and especially in your final days, we stood across from you as you didn't show any self-pity, as if you didn't want to make it harder for us. In one of our conversations, two or three days before you left us, I told you that we all think you're a real hero. You lifted your beautiful eyes, looked at me and said, 'I have to.' 'Why do you have to?' I asked. 'For the girls.' You summarized it all so simply. I'll also never forget the hardest moment for me, when the doctor said it would be best to transfer you from the hospital to the hospice. 'OK, fine', you said. It was hard for us to watch. For a moment I thought you were tired of fighting, considering all the things you went through. After the doctor left, you told me that you have another question for her. So I asked her back and you asked about the experimental medicine and she explained why it isn't relevant in your case, and you again said, simply, 'OK, fine.' And I felt how... how my heart is breaking inside me. Every time I'm reminded of that, I break. Naomi and I were the last to leave the room after you passed away. I looked at your face, beautiful and calm, with a slight smile, not like the look of horrible pain you had, just moments ago, while you struggle to breathe with the oxygen mask. I remembered the first time I saw you in a hospital. For a moment your face looked so alive, until I said to Naomi, with a childish hope, that maybe you haven't died yet. But there is no doubt that when the guy upstairs saw the enlightened angel who was called upon him, it was obvious that he wouldn't give you up. Either way, you're in a better place than the cruel one you've been to lately. Meirav, I wanted to have many more conversations with you. I told you that I love you but didn't emphasize exactly how much. Perhaps your light has dimmed but it hasn't turned off. Farewell my little sister. I miss you so much. Rest in peace. You deserve a full rest. May Meirav's memory be forever blessed. 'Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps a way. 'Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps a way. 'For He will give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 'They shall bear thee upon their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.' Let's go. Let's get the hell out of here. - Wait for me outside. Where are you going? - To find the sign. Wait for me here. Your sister took my spot. I wanted to be buried next to my son. My wife too. But I think they'll be OK next to one another. I hope. I hope she'll look out for him. Or that he'll look out for her. Where are you? At the cemetery. I forgot to take care of it. We don't have the plots next to Ronnie. But he has a good neighbor. Meirav. What's that noise? Which? That? Mmm... It's the lighter. Where are you? At the dentist's. What are you doing there? I have an appointment. Open your mouth, please. Let's go out. Open, please. Open. Close. Open, please. Open. Close. Thanks. Let's see. Wait here, I'll check that everything's OK. So... Ping-pong? You promised. Later? You owe me a match. Go home, Zooler. Eyal! Any hot water left? I brought falafel. Wait for me and...? Don't you like it?
