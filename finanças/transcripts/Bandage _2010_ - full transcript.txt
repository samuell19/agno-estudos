This part. After the second chorus is done, the part after that is too long. "Grown-ups won't do anything to help, they won't teach us a thing" "Now you should just look at the world through your own eyes..." You don't need any of that bit. What's with Natsu coming out with something this serious? Well, just cut that bit out then. If you're okay with that song, since the deadline is near, let's decide on this song. Well, but to arrange this song... we should ask Arumi. Mm, I heard the demo tape. It's good as a song. But it's quite up-beat. We'd like something a bit more modern. Oh, if you want to make it more modern... then how about a mixture? For example, by bringing in a totally different feel to it. What would be good for that? Ah, like this, "Bapapa bapaba bapapa bapaba~" Putting in an old jazz record phrase into it. Put that to it. Then add in a brass phrase into the third verse of it. Yes, yes, yes. Then use sampling data to create it. Then also adding Yukiya's fast "Boom, boom, boom" to it as well. I'll make the rhythm track on my computer, then we can add it in to the live session later, right? But there's still the last problem of the brass parts. Sampling, well.. it wouldn't work smoothly, so we can't use it. Mm, live is the best. Bapapa bapaba bapapa bapaba~ In the end it'll end up like the ska composition I emailed you. Ska and Japanese pops. How about this? - It sounds complicated. - No, just give me three days. Bapapa bapaba bapapa bapaba~ Anyhow, it'll be a mixture.

Let me see the music sheet. Let's see... I told you to cut it completely from the 68th bar. - No, I can't cut that bit out. - No, no. It's too long if you don't cut it out. - I said it can't be cut. Natsu, what do you think? Hm? Well... I... Either's fine. Damn it! I'm out of here. Get back in there and work. Music can't be cut and pasted so easily like that. You don't even know that? You're over. As a musician? Yes, I am over. - That's why I'm a manager instead. Why do you have to make me say it out loud? - That wasn't what I meant. But I do think your way of arranging songs is pretty good for this era and should sell well. You really are over. Actually... for this song, Natsu's demo was best. That song was requested by Okazaki. Right, let's take a quick glance over the single charts this week. Going a massive 40 points up from 50th place in the ranks, it's LANDS with the song "Genki." With a raspy vocal it mixes in a ska rhythm. I feel it'll hit the top of the pop scene this year.

I've been with them for 15 years since they were formed. Naturally I'm happy, but don't misunderstand me. - Everyone, are you well? - Well, well, well, well~ Ah, creepy. Well, well, well, well, well~! Shut up!! I hope it doesn't all end with this one hit. - Good work. - Good work, Arumi. "Yuuki?" I'm not so sure about having "Yuuki" after "Genki." After "Genki" and "Yuuki" what's next? "Yaruki" (motivation)? "Honki" (honesty)? "Heiki" (fine)? - Let's go with that. - Kokubo, just a moment! - What? Let's first think about if this direction is good or not. They hit the big time with "Genki" so society is expecting the next song. Not the same thing, but something better. - We have that here? - Yes. - Clearly it's only second best. - Hey, hey! I'm a well-known producer! "Yuuki" - Clearly it's only second best. - Hey, hey! I'm a well-known producer!

Who am I? Hello. How are things? You well? - What makes you sell so well? - Another round, thanks. - A beer. - Be sure to get the change. - Okay, the company, the company will pay. Yes, get a receipt. Tomorrow we have a meeting. See you there. Yukiya, you want to go home with me? Okay, good night. Natsu! Did you hurt yourself? Are you okay? Hey, Natsu... There you go. Yukiya, be nice. - Right, I'm leaving. - Okay, me too. There you go. I parked my bike nearby. If you come with me, I'll take you home. Okay. Um... ... you'll probably get angry if I say this... I think you have a really amazing talent, Yukiya, so I hope you treasure that talent. Eh? What do you know about my talents? Because I think you have a great aura to you, Yukiya. - Aura... what's "aura?" - Eh? Well, aura is like... Can you see it? No, it's not so much that I can see it, but... It's not true. - You don't believe in such things? - I don't believe in anything. - That's so depressing. - Why? Well, it's hard to explain. Do you know "loneliness?" Can you see loneliness? Do you know what color loneliness is? I don't know. I'll show you. Put your hands out like this. Like... it feels all fluffy. - Synchronize yourself between space and yourself. - How long will it take? Until you feel it. Is that loneliness? No. It's pain. What kind of pain? Black pain. Black pain? Being alone becomes tougher and tougher. You want to melt into the warmth. I've started to lose track of who I am. Is this the color of loneliness? What you're feeling now, that is loneliness. What I'm feeling now. You cheated on Natsu. Coming out the the beach with a man who isn't your boyfriend and doing this with him. Surely that's loneliness. That is loneliness. Why did you do this? Why did you do such a thing! Because you ruined LANDS. What do you mean? Where's Asako? Apparently she'll be absent today. She hasn't answered her calls. "Yuuki"... it debuted at #48. When Yukari found you, she said you would be a band with a long life. That was because Yukiya was part of you. It means we need a drastic change in our direction. I'd really hoped to do this further in the future, but we have no choice but to bring it forward. Do what? Next we'll have Yukiya... ... sing. - They're not CANDIES, so they can't keep changing the vocalist. - You're so old-fashioned. What do you mean old-fashioned? - There's no other choice. - What do you mean old-fashioned? You don't have any new ideas. What's with a manager speaking like that to me!? I am a well-renowned producer! In that case, study more about recent music. This isn't the time to think only about CDs. What are you doing here? There's no point in us all staying silent about this. What will you do? You're the leader, so you decide. If I was the one who made the decision... it would be that. To stay as we are. Okay. Let's stay as we are then. But there's one thing I want to say. What? Break up with Asako. - It's not like this has anything to do with Asako. - Is that so? It has nothing to do with Asako. Sorry for saying something I shouldn't have. The problem is... The problem is... The problem is you! You think this is all just for fun! You play around being in a band and you play around with girls! You really, really, really are nothing special at all! Hey, Leader, let's make music! - Hey, let's leave. - Stop getting in my way! Idiots. Quit the band. As if we can do it like this! Let me tell you the truth. The Long Run label has been wanting to take just me and Yukiya to form a new group. Yukiya, let's quit this sh*tty band and go to the other label. I'm leaving. See you. Break up with Asako. What are you all about Asako for? She has nothing to do with this! I kissed Asako. Break up with her. Asako? Your friend has been down here for a while waiting for you. Ah, hi. - What are you doing here! - Because I was nearby. - You ever gave him dinner! - Because I couldn't seem to wake you up. I asked Natsu if he was hungry and he said he was, so I gave him some food. I was hungry. - What's with being dressed like that! - Hm? Ah, his shoes and pants were attached. - You took them off in the entrance? - It's the first time I've walked into someone's house and stripped off in the entranceway. - Would you like dinner? - I'm not hungry. - Natsu, are you... - Um, mother... Yes? - Please let me have Asako. - Eh? Allow us to get married. You're joking... aren't you? No, I think this is serious. You think? And I haven't heard anything about us getting married! I just told you then. I really don't get you. Marry me. What a messed up thing to say! - Um, are you two dating? - Yes, we are. - No, we aren't. - We're dating. - We're not. Did something happen? Like... I've started to hate myself. I'll leave. Um... your clothing... your shoes clothing... There's one of my seniors from the art department who is working at a design office. And like, they said that if I'm interested, why don't I join their company. If it doesn't impact on LANDS, then why not? What's with that? Why do you have no reaction? Do you want to quit? We've hit number one on the charts. So we've already achieved our aim, right? So the only way from now could be down. I can't believe you...! That's how you feel? You're okay. You have talent, so you could make it in any other band too. But I couldn't, right? Why are you here? Why? Because I was worried. You kissed him? Did you kiss Yukiya? That has nothing to do with you, Natsu. You cheat. Be with me. Please. Natsu! Natsu! Stop it! Let go of me! I don't have any talent, do I? - That's not true. - Shut up! What? Ouch...! Ouch... I hit a girl. I'm terrible. Terrible, right? But you're terrible too, right? You got all up close with Yukiya. And made it all fall apart. Right! You're a terrible woman. But hey... okay? Don't you think we'd be a good couple? - Right? Right? - Stop it! I can't stop. At first... when I listened to LANDS... ... I cried. I thought we seemed so alike. I heard you and thought "This is me." I really felt that when I met Natsu. I thought we were definitely so alike. I... hate myself. I hate myself so much. That's why... That's why... ... I hate Natsu too for being so like me. The way we're so indecisive... The way we're so shallow... The way we're afraid... I hate the way it's like I'm looking at myself. I hate it too.l I hate myself. I hate you too. I also really hate us. But... Leave. Leave. I'll leave. "Genki" Aa yurusenai darou hikisagarenai darou Ah, you probably wouldn't forgive me, I probably wouldn't leave Genki dase yo hora genki genki wo Cheer up, see, spirit & courage Egao ni misete hashiridase Run off showing your smile Kono sekai wa omae no mono da This world is yours Omae dake no mono It is all yours Otona wa nanika shite wa kurenai nanimo oshiete wa kurenai yo Grown-ups won't do anything to help, they won't teach us a thing Ima omae wa omae no me de kono sekai wo miru shika nai Now you should just look at the world through your own eyes Moshi sono me wa tsubureta nara mimi no sumaseba ii If your eyes are useless, then you should listen with your ears Tori no saezuri kigi no zawameki chikatetsu ya kuruma no noizu The chirps of birds, stirring of the trees, noises of the subway and cars Biru no aida wo fukinukete yuku kaze no oto wo The sound of the wind blowing between the buildings Sono mimi wo ubawaretara mada tenohira ga aru If my ears were useless, I would still have my hands Tenohira de sekai wo kanjite iya sekai nante iranai I'd feel the world on the palms of my hands, no, I don't need the world Anata dake soba ni ite kuretara sore dake de ii All I need is to have you beside me, that's all Tenohira de yubi no saki de anata no hoho ni furetai I want to touch your cheeks with my palms and fingertips Aa yume no naka demo anata ni aitai Ah, I want to see you, even if it is in my dreams Our leader pretended to look so confident, even though he was useless. Like, it seemed as if I could see a large solid earth world beyond that. That's not an example. I really could see it. But maybe it just seemed like I could see it. That's where the name LANDS came from. I understand. That's your your base atmosphere. It's your foundation. Right, what do you think? Will you tell us your answer? Well... I don't know. I don't know about LANDS.... nothing. Asako has quit. Did something happen? What will happen to LANDS? If Yukiya leaves, then the next single will be your final release. And after that? We will withdraw our support. Then it's your life, Natsu. You think about your own things yourself. What will Yukiya do? He'll either join a new group or make a solo debut. It can't be helped. Natsu, I'm sure you noticed that he's a genius. His aura is so different from other people around him. So I guess I don't have any aura. Everybody has an aura. You don't necessarily sell well because you have a great aura. Some people with a weak aura also succeed. It is just our job to try to sort that out. If you hadn't turned to catching fish for the big boys in the industry, it would be goodbye. The one who chose to be that fish I caught was you, Natsu. I wonder why. Being a manager really is a horrible job. I'll accept that. I used to purely love music so much more. Arumi and Yukiya said they'd quit the agency. Did you know that he's forming a band with Arumi for Long Run Records? You've let the fish go as well. Is that how it will go? Darn it! - Oh? - How unusual. - Natsu, aren't you a bit early? Did something happen? Yukiya... What will you do after quitting LANDS? - Eh? For real? - No... I'm not going to quit. But if they don't let us do it as we like, I want to change agencies. No matter what happens, LANDS won't disappear. Hey, what's all this about? You're the same as well. Well, so am I too. You're pretty good. It's not so hard to play the drums. - She used to be the drummer of VERONICA. - No way! - You want to do twin drums with me? - I don't want to be with an amateur band. And I like being the manager. Being the manager is fun. Hey, Yukiya, play something by LANDS.
