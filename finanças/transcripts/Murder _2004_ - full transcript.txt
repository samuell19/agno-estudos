After her! After her! C'mon! C'mon! "Yes, yes, we got her" There she is! C'mon! "Yes, yes! Hurry!" "Yes, after her!" "These effects belong to you, right?" I've spent so many years in the police force... it would appear that I've seen it all "The good, the bad and the ugly" "Know what, Mrs. Sehgal?" Had I met you at a party or a departmental store... I couldn't even have dreamed that you could murder someone Well done! "You know, it baffles me. That a happily married woman..." who even has a child... how can she kill someone so mercilessly? There must surely have been a problem? Tell me the whole story right from the beginning Mrs. Sehgal... I'm waiting The loneliness of an unwed girl... is a million times better than the loneliness of a married woman "She experiences the loneliness every moment, every night..." in her husband's bed "Five years ago, we had moved to Bangkok" It was a new beginning in this alien land... whose language and culture we were not familiar with That's exactly why we didn't befriend anyone or socialize We kept to ourselves Sudhir went away to work everyday... and I kept myself busy with a part-time job The comforts and amenities a family needs for a decent lifestyle... were all available to us But despite having everything at home... there's a vacuum in the heart A void that is difficult to live with "Hello, Papa. How are you?" Whenever someone close to us called from India... it made the feeling of living alone in this alien city even stronger "Like every Indian woman, whose limits end at her threshold..." I had my limits too That I would one day cross the limits and be so far gone... as to make a return difficult... I hadn't even dreamed of Taxi! Taxi! It's not like the rains in Bombay It won't stop for a couple of hours I stay on the second floor I'd rather you wait upstairs than remain standing here I'm getting late. Thanks Okay Taxi! The raindrops suddenly felt as if... "it was raining fire, not water" My feet started moving in his direction on their own What the heart could lead you to while it beats... can you ever really tell? "If it wasn't fated, what else was it?" "It's destiny, after all..." that leads you to path you haven't really chosen for yourself... but which has come to you on its own You're still as fond of music? "Nothing is the same anymore. But yes, music has become more important" It's something my life revolves around The tool to get over my loneliness... and the means to earn money I'm a DJ at the local disco. Moonlight You must've heard the name? "That is where I compose my music, play songs" They're the ones who gave me this house to live in "When did you? I mean, how many days did you?" Why don't you simply ask when I was released from jail! "If I can go to jail and stay there, I can even tell you about it" "You find it difficult to use the word "jail"?" A year and a half Not as long as people imagined. Just a year and a half Go and change. The bathroom's over there I'm fine. - You'll catch a cold "The bathroom's over there - I'm okay, don't worry" "Just change, Simran... don't be stubborn" I'll pick it up "While you change, I'll arrange to dry your clothes. Here you are" Go Who touched you? Who touched Simran? "Sunny, stop it! Please stop it!" "Sunny, please stop it!" "Don't hit him, please! Let me go!" You touched Simran? - Stop it "Please Sunny! Stop it! - Okay, okay" How dare you touch her? Sunny! Stop it! I'm sorry... I'm sorry! "I just can bear to see someone touching you, Simran. I'm sorry" "I love you so much, Simran. So much..." "I love you so much, Simran" "I love you, Simran" Let me dry it. - It's okay "It's fine, I'll do it on my own. - Relax, relax" "I want to make a call, Sunny. - The phone's over there" It's me "I'm stuck in the rain. Will you pick up Kabir from school, please?" I'm busy with my work. How can I go away suddenly? There's still time. You can make it if you try No Sudhir. I won't be able to make it on time "Whose number is this? - An acquaintance, it's his number" Are you okay? - I'm fine "Leave right now. Kabir will be scared, if you're late" "Handle it this once, please" At what time will you get home? - It'll take me an hour Bye. Take care "This is not fair, Simran. Bye" Shit! - My sari! It's burning! "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry - It's okay" "Sorry, I'll get you another. - It's okay" I knew we would meet some day Here you are What is it? I preserved it for you. Thought I'd give it to you when we met I can't take it Not anymore Throw it away if you don't want it Take it... for my sake. Please? "Kabir... what are you doing, son?" I'm making paper-boats I'm glad you're back. Take care of him He's torn up all the magazines and newspapers at home "He's messed up the whole pool. - What have you done, Kabir?" You've dirtied the whole pool. Who's going to clean it up now? Did you get there on time? "What a mess you've created, Kabir" Where? The school. Where else? Where's my blue file? Now go and take a bath quickly. Good boy... It was raining so heavily today and I couldn't even find a taxi "And guess what happened? - It was raining heavily, wasn't it?" I met a very old friend Really? Good His apartment was close by Imagine! Meeting him here in Bangkok of all the places How far could Hilton Tower be from my office? 20 minutes? Or 15 minutes? "If you're not interested in talking to me, why do you ask me any questions?" But I've been listening. - Listening to what? I've got to follow you around to say what I want to! "And you just won't... - Come off it, Sonia..." I'm worried as it is and I can't find the file. It's very important What? "What, goddamit!" "I'm not Sonia, Sudhir" I'm Simran. Your wife I'm Simran! "It was a mistake, Simran..." "I've made a mistake, Simran. I..." "I'm sorry, please! I'm really sorry, Simran" Whether you say it or not... "your eyes say it all, my love" My love... "in this journey of love, you have a support..." here lie your shores "Whose flight is higher than the skies..." "they, who're a class apart..." "they're the ones who make legends in love..." "they're the ones who breathe life into love" Whether you say it or not... "your eyes say it all, my love" My love... "in this journey of love, you belong to me..." "you're the light that guides me through dark paths" You're my support in life You're my shore "You're the one my world revolves around..." "you are the one my heart calls out to" Whether you say it or not... "your breath says it all, my love" My love... "mine is the name that is always on your lips" Your heart is mine "In dreams, I have admired you..." "you're what my feelings are all about" Everywhere I cast a glance... you are the one I behold Hello? "Hello, Simran" How could you forget? I even recognize your silence "Must you think so much before talking to me, Simran?" "How're you doing, Sunny? - I'll tell you when we meet" "I can't meet you, Sunny" I just can't find the time from my family and the office Am I the one you're lying to or is it yourself? I know you'll meet me. See me again... right? Why? Can't I give you a call just like that? "Like you give me a call, you can meet me too" "I'm dying to meet you, Simran" Let's meet in a little while. Outside Moonlight "No, Sameer. It's not possible. I won't be able to meet you" "All right, don't come. But I'll wait for you as usual" Nargis... "I'm going out on some important work. Will you take my calls, please?" Certainly... is everything okay? Bye Nargis... if Sudhir happens to call... please tell him that I'm in a board meeting and... I'll call him back What important meeting is this that you're asking me to lie? "Bye! - What are you getting into, madam?" C'mon... Sit Sit down You've forgotten how to sit on a bike? Sit properly "It isn't a bike, it's a time-machine" So put your hands around me and let me take you back in time We've got to go to a party and you're even ready yet? "What are you doing? C'mon, get ready..." we're getting late. Let's go. - Where are we going? "Where? Since you've stepped in, I've been saying we're going to a party" We're getting late. Let's go And what I've been saying is that I don't want to go to any party I'm very tired. You can go on your own On my own? What's come over you so suddenly? You always keep saying that we don't have a social life Neither do we visit anyone nor does anybody drop by I'm taking you out. C'mon. - Why're you taking me out? Don't take me out! Does it ever make a difference to you... what Kabir or I feel? You aren't taking us out out of love "It's to further your business... - Why're you over-reacting, Simran?" What's gotten into you today? C'mon! Does it make any difference to you? Any difference at all? "Okay, stay home. I'll go on my own" See? I knew it! It makes no difference to you! So what do you want me to do? Put up with your airs? Forget it! I've come to Bangkok to work... "I can't keep taking you out all the time, okay?" "We've been married five years, Simran. Five long years!" "You even have a son, goddamit! - I know that" "I know I have a child, a husband..." that I'm married. And nothing else is happening in my life I know it! I know it! "Simran, you yourself took Sonia's place" I didn't ask you or your Papa to do me or my son a favor But it is my mistake. I kept looking for Sonia in you I'm the one who ought to regret it. You can't be like Sonia in ten births! "You're just a selfish and self-centered woman, that's all!" Sonia? You mean? "Yes, my elder sister. My husband's first wife" You mean you married your sister's husband? I don't understand "Things that have to happen just happen, Sunny" Whatever one does You mean? I wish it wasn't my birthday I wish Papa wasn't having the opening of his store that day I wish I hadn't forced my air ticket on my sister... to go away to Bangalore I said I'd look after Kabir. And told her to go away And she went away. Never to return "As you know, Sunny..." she was always in the habit of taking over my worries She never let me lack anything She never kept anything for herself. She gave it all away to me She even took away the death that I was to get There was only one way I could get over the guilt of causing her death To devote the rest of my life to the innocent little Kabir That is the reason why I got married to Sudhir But she hasn't died even after death She still lives between the two of us "I'm leaving, Sunny. - Simran, listen to me" "This is not right. - Simran, listen to me..." I'm leaving. It's not right. - Simran! "I'm leaving, Sunny. This is not right" I forgot my file "Not right, Sunny... this is not right!" It isn't done! Hello... Simran? I've been trying your phone since this evening... was it switched off? Where are you? - I got just home "Listen, your husband had called after you left, okay?" What did he say? He called when the boss was around... and I had to say that you've gone to see the dentist "Thanks, Nargis. - That's okay" Hey listen. This meeting of yours... "it went on till very late, right? - Bye" "I'm sorry, Simran" Really. Very very sorry "By then, a lot had changed" "I managed to avoid his gaze, and walked out of the bath" But I had no idea that the sudden change in me... would make Sudhir suspicious It was only a matter of time for the seeds of suspicion... to widen the rift between us to such an extent... that everything would be finished Your moist lips... my heart thirsts for Like the rainclouds... is your luscious body It showers on me... like the clouds You are the one I thirst for... you mean the life to me Spend a night with me... till dawn... I will make love to you Your breath is fire... your body's a flame It ruins my sleep... it robs me of my peace A spell... your tresses cast on me "Your eyes are like the lake..." your cheeks are flushed With me... spend a night Till dawn... I will make love to you "Simran, what are your plans for today?" Why? - I thought we'd have lunch together I have an appointment with the dentist at 1:30 I can't cancel it. It took me a whole week to get the appointment So let me drop you on my way You go ahead. I've got some work to do on the presentation... I'll leave a bit later Okay Our eyes express... what we do not say "Heed that which the lips do not utter" You do not sleep... nor do I sleep Oh to keep looking at you... "oh, to lose myself in you" With me... spend a night... till dawn... I will make love to you Your moist lips... my heart thirsts for Like the rainclouds... is your luscious body 102. Have more ice-cream! Now lie down in this bed and take total rest I'm going to school! - Don't even dare talk about school "What happened, my tiger? Unwell?" Phone... - I'll take it "I want to go to school, Papa!" You didn't even call. What time are you getting here? You aren't eating too many chocolates anymore I can't come today. - Why? What's the matter? Kabir's running a fever. I've to stay with him Ask your husband to do the baby-sitting for a day "Why doesn't he look after his son? His son after all, isn't it?" Get here by 11:30. I'll be waiting I told you I can't come! Okay? I'm not coming! "Now don't be stubborn, okay?" Go to sleep and attend school absolutely fresh tomorrow This is the way... this way I love you sweetheart! I'll always love you! I started saying it at the top of my voice "But the cops were beating you up, cursing you" "But as soon as her voice fell on my ears, everything else faded out" Love is crazy! Of course it is! I got into the fight because of her And I've heard she has married someone else "Simran, come here" I want you to meet somebody. Mister... Come "Hello, Mrs. Sehgal. How do you do?" Fine. Thanks You were going to the gym. What happened? "Yes, that's where I was headed when I met him" He started asking me my own address I wonder who told him that we want to sell our house I don't know who's spreading these rumors about us How I wish the rumors were true! Your house is really very beautiful I wish I were in your shoes I'll take your leave now. But I at least got to meet you Meeting an Indian here is like meeting an old friend Good bye "Take care, buddy" "Can I use your bathroom, please? - Of course" "Simi, show him the bathroom. - Thanks" Shall we? Reminds me of India. Pee anywhere. No problem What say Mr. Sehgal? - True "And here, before you can zip your fly, the Bangkok police throw you in jail" Please! Let me go! Get out! No... please! Let me go! Why have you come here? I'm high on you! Quiet! Quiet! Into the room. C'mon! One kiss and I'll leave. - Don't touch me! What happened? Did something fall in there? The flower-vase. I touched it by accident Thank you Mr. Sehgal. - You're welcome "Thank you, Ma'am. Bye. - Bye. See you" "Bye, Mrs. Sehgal. - Bye" "Simran, I'm going to Bombay on some company work" "Don't put your finger in that, son" Bombay? When are you going? - Tomorrow morning "Anything you want to send to Papa? - No, nothing at the moment" Only last month we sent him the blood-pressure machine And you've suddenly planned a trip to Bombay. When are you returning? After three days. On Monday The perfume is being launched this evening Make sure you're ready. It's necessary to attend You love me? What sort of a question is that? Why? Can't I ask you? "Of course, I love you. I love you a lot" "Hi, sweetheart. I thought you'd never phone at all" "Is this your idea of a joke, Sunny? What are you trying to prove?" What do you want to prove? That you love me very much? Why had you come here? To ruin my family? "Oh come on, sweetheart. You know I didn't intend anything of the sort" "The sick joke you played, Sunny, was your first and last one" Have you any idea what I go through when you behave like this? "If you do such a thing ever again, you're going to lose me forever!" "I have a husband and a kid, dammit!" Shut up! "Mine, mine, mine! My husband, my kid, my family!" Is that all there is to your life? Do I mean nothing? "And what do I ask you for, Simran?" To show me your face just once in 24 hours? Is it too much to ask for? "I love you very much, Simran" I love you far more than your husband and kid And no power on earth can prevent me from loving you Do you hear that? No one! Not even you! Have you heard the story of the pigeon on the tree... that closes its eyes when it sees the cat? "Eyes closed, it thinks it's dark all around the cat can't see it" Nargis. Please stop teaching me I know what I've got to do. Please don't interfere "Simran, I also knew what I had to do" What's this? Nothing else occurred to me then "These blind relationships won't get you anything, Simran" "For this other man, you might have to lose everything you have" If you're deliberately over-looking all this... what can I say to you? I feel pity for you What do you think? You will keep meeting him on the sly and... your husband's never going to know? "Despite a million clever moves, our craftiness can't conceal us, Simran" It leaves us stripped some day "Mr. Sehgal, may I ask you a personal question?" Don't get me wrong "You do love your wife, don't you?" Yes Then you needn't be so worried. Let the sleeping dogs lie "The more you try to dig around, the more hurt you will be" Everything will even out on its own Nothing happens on its own "I'm paying you 50 per cent now. The rest, after the job is done" No one must get to know Please be discreet "Mr. Sehgal, I'm a professional" Simran... I'm leaving. I'll phone you as soon as I reach there Okay Make sure you fetch Kabir from school - Don't worry Bye. - Bye Bye! Mama! Mama! "I'm sorry, son. I'm late" Kabir's trembling hands had stirred my heart It was as if I had woken up from a deep slumber I had never seen Kabir so scared. It was then that I realized... "how much hurt I was causing to everyone, because of my own happiness" "Sitting there in a corner of the house, I felt as if..." everything there was giving me angry looks "When I had turned a stranger in my own house, I never got to realize" It was the headiness of lust that had blown me so far away from my world I wanted to get rid of this intoxication... "and soon as I decided that, I had a newfound strength" Where are you going? I'm actually coming back Sudhir. To my house... where everything belonged to me It was in this hope that I had set out... but little was I to know... "that having crossed the threshold once, the return wouldn't be easy" "I left that place that day, and never could go back" "C'mon, sweetheart! I have a surprise for you" Wanna see it? Wanna come up? "Who is it, Radhika?" Simran? It's all over! How many more like me? - I can explain... How many more like me? - There's no one else like you "As for me, I'm absolutely... - Radhika, you won't say a word" "Sunny, let me talk to her. I want to talk to her" If your husband keeps thinking about his deceased wife... if he can't satisfy your physical needs... "will you sleep with my man? - Radhika, please!" You bitch! - Stop it I can explain! Why didn't you tell her? You get the difference now? Between you and me? You have betrayed your husband! You come and assert your right! You whore! "Radha, quiet, I say! Don't meddle with us!" "I'm sorry, Simran. I'm sorry" "I'm sorry, Simran. She wasn't in her senses" Don't! "I'm the one who's not in her senses, Sunny. She's right" I'm such a cheap tart... - Don't say that I can sleep with just about any man! "Simran, that's not true... - Don't touch me. Don't" Stay away "Every family has its share of problems, Sunny" If the husband stops enquiring about me... does it mean I start sleeping around? She held a mirror to me! How I hate myself! "I hate myself! I have to end it, I can't bear it anymore!" You believe that whore? - Whore? She's not a whore! I'm a whore! She's a million times better than me! She does everything so openly! She doesn't find fault with her husband to sleep with you! She doesn't abandon her innocent little child! Don't touch me! Stay away! I'm a whore! Don't touch me! Listen to me! "I'm very sorry... Give me another chance, Simran" "Don't do this. - Give me another chance, please" I love you "I love you, Simran. This mistake won't happen again" Very impressive. Very impressive! When a woman gets down to telling lies... she can deceive the most cunning of men True True? You take me for a fool? You think I'm a fool? What do you think? I'll fall for your sob-story? Bitch! This acting isn't working with me! What did you say to me? You committed the murder? You committed the murder? Get up... up! You want to know who committed the murder? Take a look! Over there. He committed the murder "In Bangkok, the punishment for murder is death, by hanging" Look madam... "in all these years, I've never had an innocent man sent to the gallows" "You say that you committed the murder, whereas he says he did it" What's the truth? - I told you! I committed the murder Then why is he trying to own up? Because he wants to save me Can't you see? Why don't you understand? Coffee Coffee? "No, thanks" Have it. The night is yet to pass Are you a saint? Pardon me? Why are you doing this? What? Your flight to India was confirmed I've seen the tickets "You could've escaped, but you didn't" If you really committed the crime... why did you return? To die? Beats me No matter how decent a man is... but if his wife turns out to be a loose-moralled woman... and in her husband's absence... - Enough! Don't say anything about my wife I have given my statement. I killed him "You will find the evidence too, provided you look for it" I murdered him. I did! I did! I wonder... "what suddenly transpired between the two of you, Mr. Sehgal?" That you are even willing to give up your life for her? Tell me I can't tolerate crime in Bangkok "Moreover if it's an Indian, I won't spare him at all" So don't test my patience anymore and just tell me... when did you first suspect... that your wife is having an affair with someone? "Tell me, Mr. Sehgal. I'm waiting" Simran always used to complain that... I didn't give her enough time That's why I used to drop her at the office sometimes "But the other day, for the first time, she refused me" "Simran, what's your programme today?" Why? I thought we'd have lunch together I have an appointment at 1:30 with the dentist. I can't cancel it It took an entire week to get the appointment. It was tough I'll drop you on the way "No, you can leave. I got to prepare for the presentation" I'll leave later Okay "For the reason Simran gave, it wasn't genuine at all" My suspicion was confirmed... when I called up the dentist "No, sir. No appointment today, not even the day before. Let me see" What rubbish! She had come this Wednesday. Please check again "Not here, sir" There was only one way to ascertain the truth I hired a detective "After all, where did things go wrong?" "To find out it, that was the only way, perhaps" "Simran, you love me?" Strange question "Of course, I love you" I love you a lot "As decided, I went to India for three days..." "to make her believe that she could do anything she wanted, without a worry" "When I returned, she seemed to me the same old girl" And suddenly I felt that I was mistaken about her "God knows, mistaken as I was..." I also wished it to be that way. I wished she turned out to be innocent "Just then, I got a call from Ramanathan" "Mr. Sehgal, how soon can we meet?" Anything special? - Yes King's Park Street. In ten minutes I'll be there "Mr. Sehgal, I've seen a lot of this world" And I know... if a clever man decides to woo a woman... it hardly matters how smart and self-conscious a woman is... she eventually gives in "Mr. Sehgal, your wife is not a wanton woman" This man has trapped several other girls also Where does he live? Please tell me I knew you'd return I need to talk to you Stop meeting my wife Don't ever look at my house again. Please Why are you standing outside? Come inside "Come in, come in" Come on... come in Have a seat. I'm sorry my house is in a mess Be seated What will you have? Vodka? Whiskey? Rum? Whiskey. - Whiskey With soda? Or neat? With soda? Or neat? - Whatever Neat How long have you known her? Excuse me? How long have you known Simran? Since many lifetimes "As for this lifetime, I've known her even before you did" "I was the only one in her life, since I've known her" Know why I had been to jail? I couldn't stand someone else touching her "You meet her every day, don't you?" "Yes, I meet her every day" Want proof? You want proof? Check out the bed. Her fragrance must still linger on it The warmth of her body must still linger on the pillow... that I had kept under her waist Go! Touch her... and you will be convinced that... "I loved her dearly, I still love her dearly..." "and I shall, always" You will be convinced about what I meant to her... "what I still mean to her, and what I shall always mean to her" Know why your wife comes to me? Because I madly love her I fulfill all her needs "If you had no courage to listen to the truth, why did you come here?" "Hey mister, look here" Look what your wife leaves behind For me. To miss her To give her all those things that you are incapable of Go to your wife Go back to her And don't ever come back here! Did you hear? "Don't ever return! Or, I'll kill you" Go back to your wife. Don't ever return! Understand? Don't come back! Get lost! Never come back here again! Get out! Thanks "Sir, are these your shoes?" Sir... are these your shoes? - No "Hello? - Sudhir, I've reached" "You are coming, aren't you? - Where?" Perfume launch party. Remember why you returned early from India? Yes... I'm coming "Is everything okay, Sudhir?" Everything is fine "All right, I'm going inside. Come right over, okay?" Bye "I stopped my heart a thousand times" "I held my heart back a thousand times" "The heart is like a whiff of air" So save your heart Don't get cheated "Love is an illusion, sweetheart" Some are looking for excuses Some are looking for targets "Here, hearts are traded..." "so you better save your heart" "I stopped my heart a thousand times" "I held my heart back a thousand times" "The heart is like a whiff of air" So save your heart Don't get cheated "Love is an illusion, sweetheart" Stay away from this lover... a thorn is never a good friend If a light blinds your eyes... "rather you stay away from it" "I stopped my heart a thousand times" "I held my heart back a thousand times" "The heart is like a whiff of air" So save your heart Don't be betrayed "Love is an illusion, sweetheart" "I tried to stop my heart a thousand times..." Time? It's ten Nothing... we'll talk in the evening at leisure. Okay? But why do you want to tell him everything? Why? Why now? So that I can look him in the eye again I can't bear this guilt anymore "Of course, and you intend to heap that guilt on your husband?" "That's good. And then you'll sleep in peace, while he burns from within" "Know something? You were stupid, but you are also mean now" "Come on, Nargis. - You come on, Simran" Don't you understand? The relationship is over "Bury it, once and for all" All that remains is a bit of happiness and peace. Why do want to ruin it? "Child, is your mother in?" "Mama, the police is here" "Mama, the police is here" Greetings. - Greetings. I'm Rajvir Singh. I'm an Inspector at the local police station Yes? A report has been filed for a missing person "Regarding which, I wanted to talk to you" Can I have some plain water? Sure. - Thank you Thank you... water Who do you want to know about? - Do you know one Sunny? What's happened to him? - You know him Sunny is missing since three days Her girlfriend lodged a complaint So? So? "In Sunny's personal diary, we found some details about you" "Phone numbers, address and more" I need to talk to you regarding that Routine stuff I just know him casually Nothing special Oh! Indian connection. That's what "This is Mr. S. Sehgal, right? - Yes" S stands for Sanjay? - Sudhir Sudhir Sehgal What does Mr. Sudhir Sehgal do? He's a computer engineer in an Indo-Thai firm So he's a computer man Keep my card "In case you have news of Sunny, just give me a call" "Yeah, sure. - Thanks. I'll drink the water" "In an Indian home, even plain water in Bangkok turns into elixir" Thanks Do give me a call. - Okay "Sir, courier for you" "How are you, son? - Papa..." the police were here. A Sikh policeman The police were here? Why? Came asking for Sunny Sunny? Why here? He's missing "Where is Sunny, Sudhir?" Where is he? Did you tell him something? "Did you hurt him, Sudhir?" Did you? Did you hurt? "Sudhir, tell me" Why don't you say something? - Shut up You are still concerned for him? You bloody bitch! You are still concerned for him? You bloody bitch! "All you are concerned about is your lover, right?" I'll bloody kill you! I wish I had killed you instead of him "I should have killed you, you bloody bitch!" I'll kill you! I hate you I hate you! Life... seems... like... a wall losing color To conceal... I have nothing left The wounds are visible... through the fissures I'm your body's... shadow You can't... tear me apart Mistakes... I can't avoid Because I'm human I'm not Omniscient I admit... to all my lapses To err... is human To conceal... I have nothing left The wounds are visible... through the fissures Show up! You want to blackmail me? "Sudhir, please... - You want to blackmail me?" Show up! Get out from wherever you are "Come on! Face me! Show up, bastard! - Sudhir, please control yourself" "Come out, bastard! Face me. - Sudhir, please calm down" "Simran, I had buried the body right here" This is where I buried it. Someone is trying to blackmail me "Simran, somebody is blackmailing me! - Hold it, Sudhir" "Before someone finds out, we must get out of here" I'm going nowhere! I'd rather confess to the police... than live every miserable moment. - What will you confess? What will you confess? That you committed the murder? Are you crazy? What will happen to Kabir then? "Look Sudhir, my deeds notwithstanding, I wouldn't wish you ill" You and Kabir are taking the first flight to India "Stop raving, Simran. If I'm leaving..." I'm leaving with you and Kabir. - The cop is constantly dropping in The cop suspects me. He's keeping an eye on us "Don't be stubborn, please. Fly to India with Kabir" "Kabir's school leaving certificate, bank documents..." I'll sort everything out and reach India very soon "Please Sudhir, we have no choice" Please There's no alternative The fear for me in her eyes... forced me to think rationally "If I didn't leave in time, I'd lose everything" It was wise to leave the country... before the Bangkok police were warned "At the airport, I found her listless" "Though she said nothing in words, she was bolstering my courage" I had committed a crime;... "and suddenly to her, her own mistakes seemed to mean trivial" I realized! Her very company is my greatest support Hello? - I've got your ticket confirmed 5 pm flight. Collect the ticket from the Air India counter Is the flight on schedule? Have you checked in? I'm on my way Simran... let me stay back. Let's all leave together "Please don't insist, Sudhir. I have to withdraw cash from the bank" "I'm responsible for this mess, so let me sort it out" "Just leave, quickly. If the Bangkok police find out..." I'll talk to you later I realized she was in trouble... I couldn't go any further My legs voluntarily headed back. I knew that she'd do anything... to save me from the police And when I find out that... she was willing to give up her life for the sake of me and my son... I couldn't stop myself Inspector... will you still call my wife treacherous and loose? Will you? "Please find a good lawyer, Nargis" "I'm not cowering down. I'll do everything possible. Nargis, please!" "Simran, please don't worry" I know competent lawyers around here. And they are Indians They will try their best to... - Sudhir must be freed... "at any cost. - I know, Simran" Listen to me "You said the corpse just disappeared, right?" It has become very difficult for the cops It won't be difficult to get him released. Just believe me "Thanks, Nargis" "I hope Kabir is fine? - Yes, happy" He's been drawing. Talk to him. Mummy Hello Mama "How are you son? - When are you coming, Mama?" "I'll come soon, son. - And Papa?" He'll come with me. Okay? "Mama? - Bye, son" Why didn't you leave? You could've left... why didn't you just leave? How could I? But... I'm the one responsible It's all because of me. - No "Never say that again, Simran. Please" Only I'm in the wrong I just couldn't get Sonia out of my life And I blamed you of selfishness all along I never once gave a thought as to how you'd be taking it Take care of Kabir For every mistake of yours... "perhaps, in some way..." I'm also... to be blamed To conceal... we have nothing left Our wounds are visible... from the chinks "So far, it is clear" But the one thing that really baffles me... I just fail to understand... where the hell is the body? "I think, Mrs. Sehgal knows where the body is, sir" She is a clever woman. She has fixed the poor husband Mrs. Sehgal? "That'd be too obvious, Anik" She's too smart for that "Somebody was trying to blackmail Mr. Sehgal, right? With photographs" Do one thing. Get a search warrant and go and search Radhika's house "The girlfriend? - The girlfriend, exactly" Get everything you can lay your hands on. File reports... "drug reports, negatives... anything" "Now move! Move! - Yes, sir" "How've you been, Simran?" "Who are you trying to call, Simran? - It all happened because of you" Because of you Sudhir is in prison So? So what? "When I was in prison, he stole you away from me" Now he's in prison And I'm going to steal you away from him "I was raised from the dead for your sake, Simran" "He didn't die, sir" He was alive That evening when I reached outside Sunny's house... I saw Simran's husband stuffing something into his car "I smelt a rat, so I tailed him to the auditorium's parking" "When I got the opportunity, I reached his near" I found Sunny. He was seriously injured I'm not dying so easily "For you, I escaped death" How else do you want me to prove my love for you? How could you do this to Sudhir? How could you do this to him? I don't believe this! "You are worried for someone who never loved you, eh?" What's wrong with you? And look at me! I have always loved you "Not once, I made love to you so many times" "I have endured so much for you, Simran" It was so tough sending your husband to jail. You know that? I'm not going to spare him "Will he give the money, Sunny?" "Sweetheart, we're honeymooning for the rest of our lives" And Sudhir Sehgal is going to foot the bill Don't mess it up. Trail that car I obeyed Sunny's every order. - Don't let me die He got back into the car "After 2 am, Sudhir came out to bury the corpse" He was unaware that Sunny was alive "As per the plan, I caught him on camera" Enough pictures to blackmail Sudhir "After burying the corpse, he stood there for some time" It almost killed me I thought it was too late "But he was alive, sir. And I thought..." it was my love that always pulled him out of the jaws of death "But I was so wrong, from the very beginning" Sunny was never mine "Simran, what is wrong with you? Why are you running away from me?" Don't touch me! Only my husband has the right to my body "Only Sudhir has, you dig?" This can't be happening! This can't be happening! What did you say? What? Come again! "Go away, Sunny! At once! Or I'll call the police" I'll call the police! I will call! Police! Police! "He was alive, sir. And I thought..." Let me go! - Come with me "Don't make me hurt you, Simran" "Enough with this game, Simran. Why are you running away from me?" "Come, let's go home" Are you crazy? "Are you scared of me, sweetheart? Don't make me furious" Please let me go "It's all over, Sunny. Please let me go..." Simran! Simran! "Open your eyes, Simran" Are you all right? Mrs. Sehgal... everyone goes around the holy fires and takes the marital vows But the relationship that stands the fires of life... is the most sacred and truthful bond Congratulations for marrying again "May nobody set you apart, I pray" Stay happy. Cheers Come with me... let's again... make a home of our dreams The pieces that lie shattered... let's put together Let's search... and bring happiness home again It takes two... to bear... the burden of life Ripped by: SkyFury
