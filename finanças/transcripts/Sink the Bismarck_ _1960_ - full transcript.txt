(♪ brass band plays "Deutschland Über Alles") (news report in German) (crowd chants) Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! (siren) (distant explosions) This is London. Ed Murrow reporting. To an American reporter there is something very special about the people of this city, this island, this nation. Never in the long history of Great Britain have her fortunes been as low as they are in this spring of 1941. Britain is fighting alone for her very existence, fighting desperately, yet her people remain steadfast and unflinching. Britain's allies have been defeated one by one, as the dark stain of Nazi conquest- spreads across the map of Europe. In Africa, Rommel is giving the 8th Army a very bad time, Greece has fallen and the Luftwaffe continues to smash English cities. The worst news of all comes from the North Atlantic, where last month German U-boats and surface raiders sank 600,000 tons of shipping. In this battle, Britain's lifeblood is at stake. This is the battle on which depends the future course of the war - the future course of British history. The battle of the North Atlantic is fought at sea, but it is directed from the Admiralty here in London. Buried deep in the Admiralty Building 200 feet underground, is the War Room. Here is the guiding brain and central nervous system of the British Navy, the operations division. Roberts, take Captain Shepard's things and put them in the office. Thank you. This is the message centre for incoming and outgoing signals. These tubes lead to the wireless room just down the hall. Oh, Shepard... - Anything wrong? - That man's uniform. We're informal about some things. It's different from the bridge of a ship at sea. - Is that so? - Oh, yes. Has to be that way. This is Commander Richards. Captain Shepard is the new director of operations. - How do you do? - Don't let me interrupt your meal. Captain Shepard, 2nd Officer Anne Davis. Captain Shepard's taking over from me. - How do you do Sir. - How do you do? Be nice to her, Shepard. If she ever got angry and walked out, we'd lose the war. - Really? - You can depend on this young lady. I've done it more times than I care to admit! Anne, be a darling and get your report in as soon as possible. - We mustn't be late for Jimmy's party. - Righto. I suppose I should shed a few tears at leaving this place, but quite honestly I've hated the job. Too much responsibility. Too much strain. I'm getting a command at sea like I always wanted. Congratulations. I hope you find one that doesn't involve too much strain. The point is, it's a different kind of strain. If a man's going to serve in the navy, he ought to serve at sea. Unless it's a man like yourself who's already seen a lot of action. He should still serve at sea. Yes. I'd better get along. I'll say goodbye now unless you have any questions. I don't think so, thank you. Good luck. Thank you. We thought we might be of some assistance, sir, not knowing your way around yet, sir. - Is there anything I can do for you? - Yes, there is something you can do. A few moments ago I saw a rating enter the War Room without his jumper. From now on, everyone will be properly dressed at all times. I cannot have officers eating sandwiches on duty, under any circumstances. I'm sorry, Sir. It won't happen again. Excuse me, Sir. Commander Richards stood two watches without relief and... I'm sure Commander Richards doesn't need an interpreter, Miss Davis. I was also surprised to hear a Wren officer addressed by her Christian name. To me this kind of informality is both irregular and inexcusable. Come in. Sorry to interrupt, sir. Priority signal. Thank you. Excuse me. Come in. Oh, Shepard. You know the assistant chief of naval staff? - Yes, very well. - How are you, Jonathan? Glad to see you. Thank you. I have a signal here sent from our naval attaché in Stockholm. He reports two German warships steaming through the Kattegat. - What ships are they? - He doesn't say. - Do you think it might be the Bismarck? - It's possible, sir. She's just completed three months' training. They couldn't pick a better time to break out, could they? With this Crete business, and our convoys scattered all over. I've a nasty hunch that's the idea. I hope for once you're wrong. We can't afford to have that monster on the loose. - Look what Scharnhorst and Gneisenau did. - 22 ships sunk. 115,000 tons. All in two months. And they don't have anything like Bismarck's fire power. She could stand off and sink every ship in a convoy without ever coming under fire. Shepard, get on to the commander in chief, Home Fleet. Tell him we're not sure, but we're very much concerned. Say we'll let him have any information we get. Aye aye, sir. Shepard? Prepare your recommendations, in case it is the Bismarck. Very good, sir. Pretty rough assignment for a new man on the job. I'm not worried about Shepard. He's one of the ablest men in the service. I'm also told he's as cold as a witch's heart. - That may be a slight exaggeration, sir. - I want a man who's cold. I'd like a man with no heart at all, no soul, just an enormous brain. The battle of the North Atlantic is grim. It won't be won by charm and personality. - We've had too much of that here. - I've known Shepard for years. We've served together before. He was different then. - Any particular reason for the change? - I suspect there are many reasons, sir. Reasons of a personal nature. Oh. I see. How are we going to get the information on those two ships? - We have an agent in Norway... - Better get in touch with him. We don't want to contact him directly. It's too dangerous. And there isn't time to go through Zurich or Stockholm. In this case, you'll have to make direct contact. Sir, this man is in Nazi-occupied territory. I realise that. All the same, we must get in touch with him immediately. Aye aye, sir. (dog whines) The enemy ships were sighted coming out of the Baltic. Obviously heading out to sea, obviously not in the service of the King. Now, what have we got over here at Scapa Flow? Battleships King George V, Prince of Wales, battle cruiser Hood, and a few cruisers and destroyers. The rest of the fleet's out on convoy escort. It's from Admiral Cunningham. "Situation in Crete is deteriorating." "German airborne troops have captured Maleme airfield." Why is it we never get our bad medicine in small doses? Perfect timing for an enemy break-out in the North Atlantic. Cunningham and his fleet busy down here in Crete. Somerville's got his hands full tying to reinforce Malta with Force H. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau are here ready to come out again. We must keep them covered. And 16 convoys to guard, scattered all over the Atlantic. If we had 100 more ships, we still wouldn't have enough. Sir,we've just had a signal from our agent in Norway. The message is incomplete. "Sighted two enemy ships off Kristiansand at 0335 sailing due west." "Cruiser Prinz Eugen and..." Transmission stopped abruptly at that point, sir. - Did you try to get him back? - Yes, sir. No further contact. - Where is Kristiansand? - Here, sir. Southern tip of Norway. What do you think, ACNS? I don't think this man would have transmitted if it hadn't been something really important. We'll assume that it's Bismarck. Shall we put Coastal Command on air reconnaissance? By all means. Everything from Bergen southwards. Tell them to photograph anything suspicious. I'll talk to Commander in Chief at Scapa Flow. Aye aye, sir. (siren) Excuse me, sir. First Sea Lord on the line, sir. Commander in Chief. - Hello, Jack. How are you? - I'm fine. Those two German ships were sighted off southern Norway at 0335. One is the Prinz Eugen and we're not sure about the other. Do you think... Proceed on the worst possible assumption that it's Bismarck and she's trying to break out. I may be wrong, but I can't think of anything worse at the moment. I agree. We can't afford to let her get loose in the Atlantic. - I'll come to immediate notice for steam, sir. - All right. Goodbye. We're directed to assume it's Bismarck and Prinz Eugen and they're attempting to break out into the convoy lanes. Now, gentlemen, they'd have four available passages, wouldn't they? Here's the Denmark Strait, the passage south of Iceland, the Faeroe-Shetland passage, and the Fair Island Channel between the Orkneys and the Shetlands. - Anyone care to place a bet? - What about the Iceland-Faeroes Channel? Not too near our bases and room for manoeuvre The nearest exit, Fair Island Channel, is only a few hundred miles. - Much too close to our air patrol. - You're of no help to me, gentlemen. All you're saying is than it could be any one of the four. Actually, of course, you're perfectly right, and I'm afraid somehow we've got to guard them all. Have we any idea where they are now, sir? Nothing definite. Jenkins, check with Coastal Command that they're still carrying out a search. Looks like two cruisers. That's what the pilot said. One's a cruiser, all right. The other one's... Bismarck. - Bismarck's been located in Norway. - Identified. Bismarck's in Grimstad Fjord. They want us to send everything we've got. Bombers, torpedo planes, everything. - How was it? - No luck. Visibility down to nil. - You can't bomb in weather like that. - We came in as low as we could. - What convoy's that, Miss Jackson? - OG 62, sir. Right. Now, Miss Davis, take the Arethusa from OG 62... and put her with the Home Fleet. Good. Take the Victorious from that convoy forming up in the Clyde, WS 8B. - Put her with the Home Fleet - Sir, Operations, Home Fleet calling. Director of Operations. No, I'm sorry. We still have no information. Well, the weather's closed in over there and aircraft can't see a thing. Yes, as soon as I hear. Right. Right, I will. Take the Repulse from WS 8B and put her with the Home Fleet. Right. Home Fleet looks better now, doesn't it? Yes, sir, but I wouldn't give much for the convoy. You recall that's a troop convoy, don't you, sir? Yes, I do. They've got a long way to go to the Middle East. This leaves them with almost no protection. I'm quite aware of the circumstances, Miss Davis. In my opinion this is a risk we have to take. We have to take, sir? Well, Shepard? What do you have in mind? I think we must reinforce the Home Fleet. We can't expect them to patrol everything from here to Greenland with what they've got. Where do we get the ships? We'd have to take ships away from other duty. It would involve some risk. We could take Victorious and Repulse off escort duty. It'd give the commander in chief an aircraft carrier and another battle cruiser. - What convoy were they covering? - W8 SB, sailing from the Clyde tomorrow. It's a large troop convoy, sir. 20,000 men. We'd be exposing them to along and dangerous voyage without proper escort. Is that what you're recommending? Yes, sir. You're willing to gamble the lives of 20,000 men? I think there's a difference between a gamble and a calculated risk. Good for you, Shepard. Of course, I realise it's not an easy decision to make. The important ones never are. Detach those two ships from the convoy. - Inform Commander in Chief, Home Fleet. - Aye aye, sir. They're giving us Victorious and Repulse. Now we can send Hood and Prince of Wales to support the patrols near Greenland. I want them ready in an hour. Yes, sir. The Prince of Wales has civilian workers aboard. They're making adjustments to the gun turrets. If they finish on time, have them put ashore. If not, they'll sail with her. Aye aye, sir. As far as the rest of the fleet's concerned, we'll wait here for some definite information. I suppose my nerves can stand it if yours can. I have just talked to Captain Shepard in London. He says visibility over the coast of Norway is nil. She may still be there. She may have sailed. What's the forecast? Pretty bad, I'm afraid, sir. It looks like two days of very thick weather. (German accent) The weather report is good. Two days of heavy overcast. Good news. Is it not so, Captain? - It is, sir. - Thank you, Bernhardt. We have a most interesting chess game here, Lindemann. The important moves this time are the opening. To break out into the Atlantic will not be easy, sir. Yes, but we have the advantage, because they do not know what we are going to do. We can move out immediately or we can hide for a while under this beautiful overcast. Also, we have a choice of four different exits. Group North has suggested the Iceland-Faeroes passage. You're not forgetting that, sir? We have to take orders from Group North. We do not have to take suggestions. Yes, sir. Lindemann, we have a great opportunity here. I do not intend to let Group North or anyone else lose it for me. There can be great glory in this voyage. Glory for the Third Reich. Glory for us. For you, sir. You are the fleet commander. I will see that you are not forgotten. I was forgotten after the last war. Until the Führer came to power, I got no recognition, no promotion. I was ignored, just as Germany was ignored. The world only remembers the winners, Lindemann. We must make sure this time that it will remember us. I'm sure it will. - How soon can you get under way? - I can have steam in half an hour, sir. Captain, I want to be out of here in 15 minutes. - Very well, sir. - Signal Prinz Eugen. Very well, sir. (man shouts in German) There's a signal from Commander in Chief, Home Fleet. An aircraft has got through to Grimstad. There's nothing there now, sir. Well, they've sailed. At least we know that much. Now we can get moving. - Position of all convoys, sir. - Thank you. All we can do now is wait and see what happens. That's the worst part of our job - the waiting. - You have a son in the service? - Yes. He's at Gibraltar. He's an air gunner in the Ark Royal. I bet you're glad he won't be mixed up in this Bismarck show. Why should I be glad? If you were, you wouldn't admit it, would you? Even to me. He's serving with a fleet. He must take his chance like everyone. I see. An air vice-marshal's coming to help on reconnaissance. Give him a briefing. Very good, sir. You want to speak to the crew? - Have they been alerted? - Yes, sir. Achtung! Captain Lindemann? With your permission, I would like to address the ship's company. - As you wish, sir. - Thank you. Officers and men of the Bismarck, this is the fleet commander. I can now tell you that we are going out into the North Atlantic to attack the British convoy system. We are going to sink their ships until they no longer dare to let them sail. It is true we are only two ships. But the world has never seen such ships. You are sailing in the largest, the most powerful battleship afloat, superior to anything in the British Navy. We are faster, we are unsinkable, and we are German! You cadet officers, you were selected by the highest authority to make this voyage. When you return to the fleet, you will have many inspiring stories to tell, stories of German sea power, stories of Nazi victory! To all of you I say this - never forget that you are Germans, never forget that you are Nazis. Heil Hitler! (all) Hell Hitler! In the centre, the main plot. - What's that? - Another convoy. All right. Carry on. Now, sir. Over here we have the Hood and the Prince of Wales. They left Scapa Flow 40 hours ago. Here we have the Repulse, the aircraft carrier Victorious, and the King George V. They've been steaming for about 18 hours. In this area, the cruisers Arethusa, Manchester, Birmingham. In the Denmark Strait, the cruisers Suffolk and Norfolk. As you can see, sir, our cruiser screen is spread out much too thinly. Now, if your people will get into the air... - You can't fly recon missions in this weather. - We realise that, of course. We must assume that the Bismarck, in company with the Prinz Eugen, is going to attempt a breakthrough to the North Atlantic. But we don't know where and we don't know when. If it's here or here, then the Repulse, the Victorious and the KGV will have to do the job. If it's here in the Denmark Strait, the Hood and the Prince of Wales will have to go after her. (Admiral) I should think they could handle it very nicely. Well, sir, Hood's a great ship. So is the Prince of Wales. But she's fresh from the builder's yard. No training for her crew. In fact, in this emergency, she had to put to sea with some of the workmen still on board. Bismarck's a tough proposition for anyone. Excuse me. The First Sea Lord can see you now. - Oh, good. Thank you very much, Captain. - A pleasure, sir. Yes, sir. Right, sir. - Yes, I will. - Commander Richards, who's your relief? - Dexter, sir. - He's late, isn't he? - A little, but I don't mind, sir. - Well, I do. Tell him I'll require him for duty the next three nights. My dearest Tom... Come in. Thought you might like a cup of tea, as long as you're not going to take any rest. What are you doing here, Miss Davis? I thought you were off duty. 3rd Officer Simpson's down with flu. I'm just filling in. Thank you. Would you file that for me, please? There's an air raid going on up top. A bad one? No, not very. Won't your family be worried about you? I have no family here. My father lives in Canada now. I thought surely you must be married or something. No, sir. Nothing at all. Doesn't that seem a little odd, if you don't mind my saying so? I was going to be married last year, but... it didn't work out. His fault or yours? He was at Dunkirk and he was listed as missing in action. It was just a year ago. A year ago next week. He was a rather wonderful man, not brilliant or dashing or anything like that, but just rather wonderful. I'm sorry. I think it helps to talk about these things, don't you? No, I don't. As a matter of fact I don't think it helps at all. Getting emotional about things is a peacetime luxury. In wartime it's much too painful. You can't turn off your emotions just because there's a war on. - You can't do anything about your feelings. - You can. (phone rings) Director of Operations. Tell you why I called, Jonathan. Dexter's here in my office and he has a special problem. - I understand you gave him extra duties. - That's correct. I require him for duty the next three nights. His girl is an army nurse and she's got orders to sail tomorrow night from Portsmouth. I'm sorry that Dexter's young lady is going overseas, but that's beside the point. Can't you make an exception? I'm not prepared to make an exception for this officer or any other, certainly not for reasons of personal convenience. It's very simple, sir. Either you have discipline or you haven't. I'm sorry, Dexter. Thank you, sir. By the way, there's a fleet commander aboard the Bismarck. Yes. Admiral Gunther Lutjens. Lutjens. - You know this man? - Yes, I do. One of his cruisers sank my ship. Oh. Then you'll have a special interest in him. Commander Richards, have a bunk made up in my office. I want the latest report on all shipping in the North Atlantic. - Is there any air recon yet over this area? - No. The weather's still too bad. You show two cruisers in the Denmark Strait. Is Suffolk back on station? We assume she is, but we don't know for certain. She's quiet as a tomb. Alter course to 190. - Starboard 15. - Starboard 15, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Bloody fool. This blasted fog. It's like looking into a cake of ice. I can't see a thing. If you see something out there, it'll have 15-inch guns on it. A solid foot of armour plate, that's what the Bismarck's got. - Who said so? - The gunnery officer, that's who. He said for all the good our guns'd do, we might as well throw crumpets at her. I wish someone'd throw crumpet at me. Ship bearing green 45! Two ships bearing green 45! - Hard aport. Full ahead both. - Hard aport. Full ahead both, sir. Shall we follow them, sir? Steady on 130 Steady on 130 - Yeoman? - Sir? Make to Admiralty. "Bismarck and cruiser sighted. Course south." "My position..." Give latitude and longitude. Get that off immediately in case we run into trouble. - Check radar. - Check your radar plot. Enemy report from Suffolk, sir. They've found her. Picked her up in the Denmark Straits. Bismarck and a heavy cruiser. 6645 north, 26 west. There, gentlemen. Course southwest. Now things are looking up. - Tell the First Sea Lord immediately. - Aye aye, sir. Good job we've got some heavy stuff in the area. Let me have an intercepting course for Hood and Prince of Wales. Sir, this one's from the Norfolk. The Norfolk's there too, with Suffolk. They're shadowing in thick fog using radar. I hope that radar works better than usual. If she turned on them, she could blow them out of the water. No. Lutjens is too clever for that. He'd rather shake off a pair of cruisers than stop to sink 'em. Course to intercept Bismarck is 310. That'll bring Hood in contact just about there. Just about here, sir. The intercepting course is 310°. Fit full speed we should make contact at 0300. I don't want to engage them until daylight. Give me a course and speed to intercept at dawn. At 27 knots, course 295, we should meet them at first light. We'll proceed on that course and speed. Pass the word to Prince of Wales. Anything further, sir? Signal from flag, sir. Speed - 27 knots. 200 revolutions. Admiral's intentions follow, sir. Very good. Boatswain? Tell the Captain we're at 27 knots. Also the Admiral's sending his intentions. Oh, how are the civilian workers enjoying themselves? They're loving every moment of it, sir. I'll tell you one thing - I'm not sleeping in one of these bloody hammocks. Make a note to speak to the Captain. we'll have double beds put in. Oh, very funny. Well, I reckon it's a diabolical liberty. I never had a chance to phone my wife to say what's happening. - They were afraid she might not let you go. - Imagine what she thinks I'm up to. - Pity she's so wrong, innit? - She'll never believe this. Here are we going? We picked up speed. What's that for in the middle of the night? Captain speaking. Bismarck has been sighted in Denmark Strait. She's on her way out into the Atlantic and we plan to tackle her about dawn tomorrow morning. You will go to action stations shortly after midnight, so get all the rest you can. I'm confident tomorrow is going to be a big day for us. Good luck and good shooting. They can't do this to me. I'm in a reserved occupation. I never thought a thing like this would happen. Fancy me fighting Germans on the high seas. Here, lad. You ever been in a battle before? Yeah, hundreds of times. Don't hardly give it a thought any more. - Latest plot report, sir. - "Suffolk and Norfolk still in contact." "Hood and Prince of Wales are estimated 120 miles from Bismarck." - Should be quite a show tomorrow morning. - I know where I'd rather be. Excuse me, sir. What a time for Shepard to take over. I hope he's getting all the help he needs. Help, sir? I didn't think he needed any help. Captain Shepard is a very old friend of mine, Miss Davis. You'd be quite wrong if you judged him too harshly. He had his ship blown from under him last year up in Norway. This job here means promotion for him but he can't wait to get another ship. As long as I've known him only two things really matter to him. - His family and the sea. - I didn't know he had any family, sir. His son is an air gunner serving in the Ark Royal. He and the boy are terribly close. And his wife? He hasn't spoken about her and I haven't asked. Signal from Commander in Chief, Home Fleet. "Suffolk and Norfolk will continue shadowing." "They will make no attempt to engage the enemy." Make to Hood and Prince of Wales. "If enemy maintains present course and speed, you should make contact at approximately 0510." Right, sir. - And Dexter? - Yes, sir? Add to that "Good luck". Very good, sir. I'm not strong enough for this sort of thing. And I got flat feet. Shut up, Henry. If we're gonna fight the Bismarck, I'm gonna check "Y" turret. Yeah, and we'd better check that turbine. Come on, Henry. Anyway, I always get seasick. Hood and Prince of Wales are somewhere in here. Suffolk and Norfolk report Bismarck and Prinz Eugen here. - If so, we shouldn't have long to wait. - It should be getting light up there. Signal from Suffolk. "Have sighted Hood and Prince of Wales bearing southeast." That means they've made it. Good old Hood. She'll get them. (bell rings) Breach open! Right gun shell! Right gun shell! Right gun first half charge! Right gun second half charge! Bridge. Smoke bearing green 40, sir. Bismarck and cruiser bearing green 40, about 12 miles. Closing fast. Those are not cruisers. They are battleships. Captain, open fire on the leading ship. - Target leading ship. Stand by to open fire. - Target leading ship. - Stand by to open fire. - Hard aport. Open fire when in range. Concentrate on Bismarck. Let me know when you're ready to engage guns and then we'll turn. Tell Prince to Wales to open fire when she's in range. Hard astarboard. Shoot! Range 25,000, bearing 300. All turrets ready to open fire, sir. - Open fire. - Fire! Fire! That was too close for comfort. Turn 20° to starboard, Captain. Shoot! Fire! Unbelievable. - Blimey. - What happened? The Hood's gone. Good God. - Yeoman. - Yes, sir. Make to Admiralty from Prince of Wales. Tell them... tell them the Hood has blown up. Aye aye, sir. - Starboard 15. - Starboard 15, sir. Starboard 15. Signal from Prince of Wales, sir. Well, what is it? It says HMS Hood has blown up. Bring it here. Signal from Suffolk, sir. "Hood sunk. Prince of Wales and Bismarck exchanging fire." Fire! Shoot! Port 20! Tell the engine room to give me all they've got. - Course 240. - Very good. Course 240. Fire! Give me a hand! Hard aport. Steer 150. Make smoke. She's badly damaged, sir. She's turning away and making smoke. - Do you want to pursue? - No. We have more important work to do. - Hold your course. - Steady on present course. Captain, congratulations. It's a great moment for the German Navy. Yes, Lindemann. And for the two of us. (speaks Spanish) This morning, HMS Hood, the largest British warship, was sunk... (international radio announcements) This is London. Ed Murrow reporting. This island, which is no stranger to bad tidings, received news today that HMS Hood, the largest warship in the British fleet and pride of the British Navy, has been sunk by the German battleship Bismarck. From the Hood's complement of 1500 men, there were three survivors. In the same engagement the battleship Prince of Wales was badly damaged. Two British capital ships have been put out of commission and the most powerful battleship in the world is now loose on the high seas. It remains to be seen if the British Navy has the capability at this crucial moment of concentrating enough sea power to deal with the situation. There is undoubtedly great rejoicing in Berlin tonight and also on the Bismarck. Here's to the ship, Lindemann, and here's to us. We have beaten the best they have. You realise that? - Yes, sir. - They will never stop us. Not now. - You wanted the damage-control report, sir. - What is it? We received one hit, forward on the port side, over number-two fuel tank. - We are losing oil. - Anything serious? No, sir. I would say the damage is very slight. However, I would recommend we put about and have it repaired. Put about? You mean go home? Yes, sir. We could refuel at the same time. Are you mad? We have fought our way out into the Atlantic. This is no time to turn and run for home. We wouldn't be running. We've won a tremendous victory. But it is not the victory that was ordered. You haven't been close to the high command, Lindemann. Do you know what happen when Admiral Raeder reports the sinking of the Hood. The Führer will smile, and everyone else will smile, and then, a few moments later, he will turn to Raeder with a scowl. "What about the convoys, Raeder? Have they sunk any convoys?" There will still be plenty of convoys after we make repairs. Is your ship unmanoeuvrable, Captain? Are the guns damaged? Anything out of action? No, sir. Then we will push forward as instructed by the high command. But surely the Führer must realise... Are you now going to tell the Führer what he must realise? - No, sir. - Then do not tell me. For the time being, we hold our present course and speed. Yes, sir. There will be no further statement for the press for the present. Make a signal to the Admiral of First Cruiser Squadron. "Suffolk and Norfolk maintain contact with Bismarck so Home Fleet can intercept." "Continue shadowing as long as you have fuel to do so." This is Bismarck's latest position, course and speed. Send it to the C in C, Home Fleet, right away. Now, Shepard. At present speed the Home Fleet cannot make contact with Bismarck until tomorrow, and then only if she maintains her present course. - What if she doesn't maintain it? - That's it exactly, sir. - They won't make contact at all. - Prime Minister for you, sir. - First Sea Lord here. - (Churchill) Now, First Sea Lord, I want to make it unmistakably clear that there is absolutely nothing as vital to the nation at this moment as the destruction of the Bismarck. You are authorised to employ any means at your disposal, regardless of risk and regardless of the price that must be paid. This is a battle we cannot afford to lose. - I understand, sir. - I don't care how you do it. You must sink the Bismarck. Good luck to you. Thank you, sir. Well, gentlemen, any suggestions? We cannot leave this entirely to the Home Fleet. - We must pull in everything we can. - I've ordered Rodney to leave her convoy. - She was the last available ship. - I don't suggest this lightly, sir. Down here, at Gibraltar, we've Force H. Renown, Sheffield, Ark Royal. We can't strip the Western Mediterranean with this Crete business going on. Perhaps if we left Ark Royal down there and sent the other two out. No, sir. We may need Ark Royal's aircraft. What do you think, ACNS? It's taking a serious risk. I know Shepard has weighed that very carefully. In view of what the Prime Minister said, we have no choice. Well, I may be able to argue with you two, but I can't quarrel with the Prime Minister. Order Force H to sail at the earliest possible moment. Johnson. Smith. It's not for you, boy. Stratton. Singer. Shepard. Oh, thanks. - Thompson, where are you? - That's me. (Captain Shepard) My dearest Tom I'm really much too tired to write, but I think of you so very often that I'm always afraid there may be things I forget to mention. Marvellous. No letter again. Where are we off to this time? That's what I'd like to know. Is it true your father is Director of Operations? - I'm afraid it is. - He's got a nerve moving us out of Gibraltar. Just when we get fixed up with some girls. Why don't you tell him we don't want to go? It's my fault, really. I thought you'd like a few months in England. - England? - You're kidding? Not at all. You see, my girl's in London. That's what gave me the idea. Do you mean to say you asked your father... They wouldn't dare. - Well, not in wartime. - Go on. Your father'd do the same for you. This is the Captain. I thought you'd be interested to know we'll be operating in the Atlantic for a while. we've got orders to go after the Bismarck... - No! No! Boys! - Grab him! If the Bismarck holds her course and speed, when's the earliest we can engage her? Nine o'clock tomorrow morning, sir, at best possible speed. If Norfolk and Suffolk can keep track of her, they can guide us in. Suppose Bismarck gives them the slip? If she shakes off the cruisers in the night, if we lose contact, we may never find her again. She's got the weather on her side. Looks bad for tonight. We've got to try and slow her down before nightfall. Summers, do you think Victorious could launch an air strike? She's supposed to be getting her deck-landing training. Most of her pilots have never flown off a carrier. Then I'm afraid they'll have to start their training now. Detach Victorious from the fleet. Tell her to close Bismarck at 30 knots. She's to launch an air strike when she gets within 100 miles of the enemy. That's all, gentlemen. Signal Prinz Eugen that she's to proceed on her course to Brest. Yes, sir. We will keep the enemy cruisers occupied until Prinz Eugen is out of sight. - All right, Captain. Make your turn. - Hard aport. - Hard aport, sir. - Stand by to open fire. Radar plot. Range decreasing. Decreasing very rapidly. Range down to 22,000 yards. She's doubled back on us, sir. There she is, sir. Hard aport. Full ahead both. Hard aport! - Make smoke. - Make smoke! Full ahead both. Signal to Prinz Eugen. "Goodbye and good hunting." That's all, Becker. - Very good, sir. - Cease fire, Captain. - Cease fire. - Cease fire, sir. Signal to Group West. Prinz Eugen successfully detached and proceeding independently." "Have been unable to shake off enemy cruisers because of radar." "Will attempt to break away during the night." Thank you, Mueller. - Very good, sir. - All right, Captain. You may resume your original course. Starboard 20. - Starboard 20. - Starboard 20. Contact! There she is. Starboard beam. (klaxon) Hard astarboard. What is it? - All right. One hit on the port bow, sir. - What is the damage? Very slight, sir, and no one wounded. We will have the damage repaired in a few hours. That is good. That is good. - Lindemann? - Yes, sir. If there were submarines in this area, we would zigzag, wouldn't we? Of course. And the cruisers following us would be obliged to do the same. - Yes, sir, but I would... - Captain, I want you to set a zigzag pattern. Hold speed at 20 knots. In exactly two hours we shall stop zigzagging and proceed at full speed in whatever direction we are headed. We will be out of radar range before they realise that they have lost us. This hit Victorious claims - it hasn't slowed Bismarck down at all. I know, sir. She's been zigzagging now for more than two hours. That's odd. She must know we haven't any submarines in the area. - Can Victorious do another strike tonight? - I'm afraid not. It's too dark now. - Signal from Norfolk, sir. - Yes? What is it? Sir, they've... they've lost contact with Bismarck. This is London. Over 24 hours have passed since the battleship Bismarck destroyed HMS Hood. It is reported that the British have attacked Bismarck with aircraft, but Berlin says the attack was beaten off successfully. Berlin adds that Bismarck was able to shake off the surface vessels pursuing her. The German battleship has survived the heaviest guns and ships in the British Navy, and the gloomy speculation now is that the British Navy may have trouble finding her, let alone destroying her. Of one thing we can be sure - the lights will burn late in the Admiralty tonight. This is her last known position, and this... her farthest on. That means she has to be somewhere inside that circle. In this sector, search aircraft from Victorious. To the south and west, the cruisers Suffolk and Norfolk. That leaves two possibilities. Either she's broken back to Germany or she's headed for one of the French ports. Now, Miss Davis. If you were Bismarck, what would you do? Well, I suppose I'm not very brave. I'd head for home, sir. And a very sensible thing to do too. Plenty of fuel, good repair facilities, complete protection. But not Lutjens or any other German fleet commander. - Why not? - Because in Nazi Germany he'd lose face. I've fought these people before. They have to prove their superiority every day. - It's their one tremendous weakness. - Sir? Signal from the commander in chief. "King George V running short of fuel. Can't maintain full speed much longer." Supposing she is heading for a French port. It won't be long before she gets friendly submarine support and complete air cover. Too late to stop her then. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at Brest. Supposing Bismarck joins up with them and all three decide to come out together. What then? - What's the trouble? - He collapsed. - I think he's got a temperature. - Take him in the office. - Why is this man on duty if he's sick? - I don't know, sir. He didn't report sick. - Ring the sickbay and get someone over. - Aye aye, sir. Simms, take over. - All right, leave him here. - Aye aye, sir. Sorry about this, sir. If you had a temperature, why the devil didn't you report sick? I'm sorry, sir. I didn't want to miss anything. All right, Brown. We'll get you along to the sickbay. If anything happens, I'll let you know. Thank you, sir. What time is it, Miss Davis? - About 6.30, sir. - Morning or evening? It's a very fine morning, and I think you should go on up and take a short walk. You haven't been out for five days. Take down this message for Commander in Chief, Home Fleet. "Best available information indicates Bismarck heading for the coast of France." "Proceed accordingly." Excuse me, but do you have to stick your neck out quite so far? I'm afraid that goes with the job. Make to Admiral commanding Force H. "Proceed to intercept Bismarck on assumption she's headed for Brest." "Suggest search by aircraft from Ark Royal. Your son is in Ark Royal, isn't he, sir? Yes, yes. Yes, he is. Get that off immediately, will you? Yes, sir. Come in. Come in, Miss Davis. - Signal for you, sir. - Thank you. This is a report on the Ark Royal's air search. They haven't found a thing. Better tell Captain Shepard. Also, two of Ark Royal's aircraft failed to return to the carrier. - No need to tell him. It can't do any good. - No, sir. - How would you like a trip to America? - America, sir? The Admiralty's sending a mission to discuss a master plot for convoys. Two regular officers and a Wren. The board picked you as first choice. It sounds very exciting. No change till this Bismarck thing is settled, then talk to Captain Shepard. Aye aye, sir. And thank you very much. Yes, it would have to be long-range aircraft. Catalinas, I should think. Yes, that's right. Call me back. - Shepard? - Sir? It seems to me our forces are very heavily committed to a single course of action. Is that based on the definite knowledge that Bismarck is headed for a French port? On definite knowledge, no, sir. It's based on my summing up of the general situation. I felt it was a decision that had to be made. I hope you're right, Shepard. I hope to God you're right. A report from Ark Royal, sir. They haven't found anything. - Oh, right. Are you off now, Miss Davis? - Yes, sir. My watch ends at seven. I seem to have a devil of a lot of work. Do you think you could stay an hour and help? Of course, sir. I have a dinner date, but that's not until nine. Good. Let me have the latest information on the availability of aircraft in Force H. "Coastal Command will activate two crossover air patrols." "The northernmost will cover possible enemy courses from Brest to La Rochelle." "The southernmost will cover La Rochelle to Cape Finistére." Good. Now, if you'll coordinate that with Coastal Command, I'll get on with the business of Force H. Then you can run along and enjoy your dinner date. What, at half past one in the morning, sir? I'm sorry. I'd no idea what time it was. By the way, I'd like to make arrangements for you to work with me full time, If you think you could face it. What I had in mind was to take you off you present duties and make you my assistant. I appreciate you thinking of me, sir. I need someone who's intelligent and dependable. Quite honestly, someone like yourself. Well, what do you say? I don't know quite what to say, sir. I... I'd make an effort not to be so rude as I have been, if that's what's bothering you. It isn't anything like that. - If you want to say no, please say so. - Well, you see... (phone rings) Director of Operations. One moment, please, sir. It's Captain Farnum, casualty section. Hello, Richard. Yes? What sort of bad news? Is there no other information? I see. Yes, I appreciate your telling me. Thank you, Richard. My son's missing. His plane ran out of fuel and failed to return. I'm terribly sorry, sir. There's a good chance he'll be picked up. You were picked up. When I got out of hospital, all I could think about was getting back to London. I wanted to see my wife. I took a taxi from Waterloo. As I drove into Welbeck Place, everything looked so familiar. Every house was just as I remembered it. Every house except mine. There was a large black hole in the ground where my house had been. Where my wife had been. I didn't think it was possible to feel such pain. I know. I've been through it myself and I know. I swore that night I'd never again get emotionally attached to a human being as long as I lived. But I made one mistake. I forgot about... I forgot about my son. You can't avoid pain by fencing yourself off. Sometimes you need the help of other people more than anything else. But you have to let them get close enough to help. I don't want any help. I found when I was deeply troubled that I needed people very badly. People want to be needed. I found that out too. We're in business. Bismarck's been spotted by a Catalina flying boat, headed for Brest. Your hunch was right, sir, Excuse me. Sir, Captain Shepard has offered me a new job, to be his assistant. I'd like very much to take it. I hope you'll have no objection. Jonathan, what have you done to that girl? She's been offered an opportunity to go to America. It means sure promotion. Now she's turning all that down just to stay here with you. I don't understand it. Here's the situation. The flying boat spotted Bismarck at 1030 and has been shadowing ever since using cloud co... Jonathan. I'm sorry, sir. You were saying? The flying boat spotted Bismarck at 1030 and has been shadowing since using cloud cover. From time to time Bismarck has put up very heavy anti-aircraft fire. By now the British know where we are. - They'll send out everything they have. - We can sink anything they send out. What was your latest fuel report? We have lost about 200 tons from the tanks that were damaged. - We have 35 per cent left. - That is more than enough. I want to check the plot. - Becker. - Yes, sir? Keep me informed about the fuel situation. I've requested air cover from the Luftwaffe. How soon can we expect them to be with us? Shore-based aircraft can operate approximately that far from the coast, sir. We will arrive at that point about dawn tomorrow. What about King George and Rodney? What is their position? Based on reports from Group West, I have them plotted 200 miles to the north of us, sir. That is good. They cannot possibly overtake us now. A day or so in Brest to make repairs and then we come out again with our tanks full. Also, Lindemann, I have an idea. Suppose Scharnhorst and Gneisenau came out with us. We'd be the most powerful fleet that ever sailed. Nothing in the world could touch us. Excuse me, sir. Personal signal for the fleet commander. "Best wishes on your birthday. Look. Adolf Hitler! This is a great honour. Yes, please. Here are the fuel consumption reports for KGV and Rodney, as close as I can calculate. - Don't look too good, do they? - No, sir. They're 140 miles astern of Bismarck. Can they steam at full speed long enough to overtake? If they did, sir, they wouldn't have enough fuel to get home. Sir. By daylight Bismarck will be in range of German air cover. - They'll send out the whole Luftwaffe for her. - And a line of U-boats. We have to slow her down so Home Fleet can overtake her before she gets into friendly waters. Well, Renown and Sheffield can't do it. That leaves Ark Royal. Ten hours of daylight left. Call it nine and a half. There's time to get off one air strike. With luck, they might get off two. Yes, sir. We'd better get in touch with Ark Royal. Your torpedoes have been fitted with the new magnetic exploders, so you should get very good results. You have Bismarck's position, course and speed. She's now 24 miles away, bearing 183°. You can't mistake her. She's all by herself, so attack immediately. Just one final word. The Home Fleet's 100 miles astern. Unless you stop Bismarck today, they'll never catch up. It's up to you, gentlemen. Good day. Sheffield's been ordered to close Bismarck and shadow her. How long ago? - This was sent an hour and a half ago, sir. - An hour and a half? It wasn't decoded immediately, sir, because it wasn't addressed to us. We just happened to pick it up, sir. Our pilots have orders to attack any ship alone in that area. Send a message to all aircraft. "Look out for Sheffield Send it in plain language, immediately. Aye aye, sir. Bit of a cockup somewhere. It's the Bismarck, all right! It's all right. They're ours. Swordfish. They sound as if they're gonna fly over us. They're using our position to get their bearings. I can see them now, sir. There they are. They're attacking us! Full ahead both. Hard aport. All guns, hold your fire. Torpedo exploded as it hit the water, sir. There's another one. - They're exploding short. What's the matter? - It's those damn magnetic exploders. - Here comes one that didn't explode, sir. - Hard astarboard. Hard astarboard. That was the Sheffield, sir. It just came through from the carrier. Signal the other aircraft. Tell them to break off the attack. - Wheel amidships. - Wheel amidships, sir. We all feel the same about what's happened so there's no point in discussing it. We've learnt a very important lesson which may well prove a blessing in disguise. Let's get on with the job. There's still enough light for one more attack. Are you up to it? Yes, but what about those magnetic exploders? They're being changed at this moment. We'll go back to contact exploders on torpedoes. Keep your seats, gentlemen. I have a message here from the Commander in Chief. Unless the enemy's speed is reduced by midnight, King George V will have to abandon the chase and turn back for refuelling." There's no need to tell you what that means. This is our last chance, gentlemen. I suggest you go below and get something to eat. You'll be taking off at 1830. Skipper! Ship bearing green 45. This is it boys. Come on, let's go! Hard astarboard. - Where was that? - The hit was on the midships. - No serious damage. - Thank you. Tell Damage Control to keep us informed. Hard astarboard. Hard aport. (phone buzzes) Captain. Hit in the steering compartment, sir. - Put your rudder amidships. - Rudder amidships. The rudder won't move, sir. - What ships are these? - 4th Destroyer Flotilla. They're getting close. We picked up two odd reports from Coastal Command following the attack by Ark Royal. The first says "Bismarck circling". The second reads "Bismarck headed nor'-nor'-west". Nor'-nor'-West? But that's impossible, sir. She'd be headed straight for KGV and Rodney. - Sounds like faulty identification. - Sir, signal from Sheffield. They've made contact with Bismarck. She's steering north at ten knots. That's incredible. It must be Bismarck. But what's she doing on that course, and at a speed of ten knots? Hit by a torpedo, I'll bet, and damaged. - Propellers? - Could be, or rudder, and can't manoeuvre. We've got a chance now, sir. I think we've got a chance. Yes. It's the Bismarck, all right. - Yeoman? - Sir? Make to Solent. "Intend to attack with torpedoes." "Ship's turning to port. Firing range 4,000 yards." Aye aye, sir. - Ring on 30 knots. - 300 revolutions. From Captain "D", sir. "Speed 30 knots. Turning to port to fire torpedoes." - "Firing range 4,000 yards." - Good, then it is the Bismarck. Damage Control. Damage Control? Damage Control, sir. Captain speaking. I want a report on that rudder. The divers are down now. They'll be up in a moment, sir. Range 6,000 yards, sir. Yes. I see. It's impossible to free the rudder, sir. It was jammed too badly by the explosion. How early can you put a couple of divers over the side? At first light, sir. About five o'clock, if the sea's not too rough. - I do not care about the sea. - I was thinking about the men, sir. Sir, from Fleet Commander. Thank you. Ah. "Group West is sending out three seagoing tugs." "All submarines in the area have been ordered to concentrate at this point." That is good. That is very good. Range 5,000. Attention all hands. Attention all hands. This is the fleet commander. We are having some difficulty repairing the damage to our steering gear, but I assure you there is no cause for alarm. 4,500 yards, sir. Stand by the torpedo tubes. By morning we will be in good hands and if the British Home Fleet should be foolish enough to appear, they will be torpedoed by U-boats. Meanwhile, let me remind you that our guns have not been damaged. This is still the most powerful ship afloat. I have in my hand a message addressed to the entire crew. "All Germany is at your side." "Your gallantry is an inspiration to our people." "You will for ever occupy a place of honour in the history of the Third Reich." This message is signed by the Führer. Range 4,000 yards, sir. Port 20. Fire when the sights come on. Two enemy destroyers on port bow, sir. - Alarm port. - Alarm port, sir. (klaxon) Range 4,000, bearing 300°. - Guns ready port. - Guns ready port, sir. - Illuminate with star shell. - Illuminate with star shell. They've seen us. Now we're for it. 20° to go, sir. Fire. All torpedoes gone. Let's get out of here. Hard aport. Open fire, main armament. - Torpedo hit amidship, sir. - Good man. Fire! She's got the Solent. - Good shooting, Lindemann. - Cease firing. Cease firing. One hit on the armour near the forward boiler room. The damage can be repaired. It won't affect our speed. Thank you That is good Destroyers are still shadowing, sir. They've orders to keep track of Bismarck until Home Fleet closes. They claim three hits with torpedoes. - It hasn't even slowed her down. - And the reports of enemy submarines? ACNS says they're confirmed. I notified the commander in chief. - What's C in C doing about it? - He hasn't altered his plans. I'd like to send him a signal telling him to be careful, but I'm sure he'd resent it. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. - I'll be here if you want me. - Very good, sir. Shepard. Sorry about your son. Sir. - Captain Shepard, sir. - Hm? Excuse me, sir. I took in an operational signal from a destroyer shadowing Bismarck. They picked up three fliers in a rubber boat. It must have been over an hour ago, sir. I couldn't get off at the time. I heard about your son so I thought I'd tell you. It might not be him at all, sir, but you never know. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, sir, ACNS has been calling you, sir. Says it's very urgent. - Assistant Chief of Staff, please. - Yes, sir. - Hello, sir. Shepard here. - Jonathan, I've got marvellous news. Your son is alive and well. He's been picked up by a destroyer. This is absolutely official. Farnum got the message half an hour ago. Jonathan? Don't you understand, Jonathan? Your son is alive and well. - What did he say, sir? - He didn't say anything. Well, you'll excuse me, Sir. Oh... - Signal for Captain Shepard. - I'll take it. - It's from King George V. - What is it? - They've sighted Bismarck. - Here comes the main event. Urgent signal for you, sir. Right gun second half charge. - How much fuel have we got left? - We'll have to break off action in two hours. - Main armament ready. - Enemy speed, ten knots. Course 350, sir. They outnumber us two to one and we can't do more than ten knots. What are you saying, Captain? This is the Bismarck. We still have all our guns and any moment now the Luftwaffe will arrive. (shouting in German) Open fire, Captain. - Open fire. - Fire! - Open fire. - Shoot! Fire! Shoot! She's hit. Good shooting, Captain. Shoot! (shouting in German) Shoot! Shoot! (shouting in German) Signal from King George V, sir. "Bismarck on fire amidships. Two of her turrets out of action." I thought I'd be cheering, sir, at this point, but I'm afraid I can't. I know. It's always that way. Shoot! (speaking German) We have to flood the magazines. Get the men out. - They're trapped by fire. - There's too much risk of blowing up. - Flood them. - What about the men? I gave an order, Hoffmann. Flood the forward magazines. Flood the forward magazines. Our fuel state is critical, sir. Get closer. We've got to finish her now. Shoot! All the guns are out of action except "A" turret, sir. - Where is your Luftwaffe now, sir? - I don't understand it. The Führer promised. He promised to send help. (explosion) They will be along any minute now. You will see. He was proud of that. "Tomorrow, the world." He said that only yesterday. He was right. Heil Hitler. Sir, all the officers on the bridge are dead. I have to tell you that all the guns are finished. Finished. Tell the men to abandon ship! Abandon ship! Abandon ship! We've got her. She's finished. The Dorsetshire has joined us, sir. Tell Dorsetshire to finish her with torpedoes. - Cease firing. - Cease firing. She's going. - Yeoman? - Sir? Tell Dorsetshire to stand by to pick up survivors. - Jenkins? - Sir? Make to Admiralty. "Bismarck is sunk. Fleet is returning to Scapa Flow." Aye aye, sir. Gentlemen, let's go home. - Shepard? - Sir? The Prime Minister would like to see us tomorrow at 11 o'clock. I assume you can make yourself available. Certainly. But why should he want to see me? I don't know. He seems to think you had something to do with this operation. - Thank you. - Well done. - Thank you, sir. Petty Officer Williams? - Sir. Take a message for Telegraphist Brown in the sickbay. - Tell him the Bismarck's been sunk. - Aye aye, sir. May I offer my congratulations too, sir? Thank you. Uh... Take a message. "Request pleasure of the company of 2nd Officer Anne Davis at dinner." Accepted. Good. Now, I know you must be very tired, and it's nearly nine o'clock, but how about tonight, right now? I'll get my things. Great heavens. It's nine o'clock in the morning, and I asked you out to dinner. We could always make it breakfast, couldn't we? Why not? You know, Harvey, these boys worry me. Four stripes on his arm and he don't even know what time of the day it is.
