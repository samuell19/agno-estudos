Excuse me, something is happening... What the...? It's him! Get him up! Why the hell are you so weak? - Pilot, get him to the stairs! - Come on! Hurry! - Move your feet! - He's shell-shocked! Freaking Astronomer, it's impossible to understand. Come on! Hurry! Just follow us, understand? Come on, jump! Hurry! Let's go! Come on. That's it. We're done for. Told you so. Told you... Don't... We're out of time! Off you go. I can't carry you any longer. Wait! Who the hell are you? Where are we going? You wanna stay? - What happened to me? - How would I know? Car accident or maybe an OD... Am I dead? Coma. You mean this is all a dream? Memories. - Whose? - Everyone who's in a coma. Everyone who's in a coma comes to the same place... here. Our brain creates a field of memories. When in a coma, it switches off and adjusts to this field. Like how a radio picks up signals. Look. Buildings, objects, people... Whatever we remember is here. Whatever we don't remember simply doesn't exist. So there you have it. Memories... It doesn't makes sense. What about the ones that... They aren't people. I'm telling you, they're memories. OK, and what about those black creatures? Are those memories, too? Hold on! Hold on. Soldier Fly! Are you going to secure the perimeter or should I? I already did. Do it again then. Listen, where are we going anyway? - Wait, does it fly? - Get in already. It's a wormhole. That happens sometimes. Someone remembered the bus near the building and someone else in the field. The memories are mixed up. Where is he? Where is Pilot? He had to distract the Reaper with a whistle. We wouldn't have gotten out otherwise. - You left... You left him?! - Hey! Didn't I tell you how dangerous that district is? And that map was bullshit. There wasn't enough time, I told you. You were rushing me! Everything has changed there. Why did we have to go there in the first place? I'm absolutely sure... ...it was worth it. Fly, show him around. And get him settled in upstairs. Let's go. The show's over! Chop-chop! Tank, what's up with the trail? Are you waiting for the Reapers to come over? Blow it up already! But we're running low on explosives. We need to ration. Ration my ass. Didn't you see how they jump? We blow up all the trails around the building. But someone always remembers them, so they reappear again. In order to stop the Reapers, we always have to be on high alert. We take turns keeping watch. Yan says there's a whole island here in Coma free of Reapers. We're always looking for those who can help us get there. He's very certain about you for some reason. You need to eat and drink here. Hunger and cold are all memories but everything is like in reality, so we have to go outside. Those from the squad with abilities are sent there. - I don't remember my name. - Nobody does. By the way, give yourself a nickname before somebody else does. - It's just a dream. - Let's go. To wake up, it's just a room... Hey! Someone just died to save you. You can't wake up. Do you understand? Your body is in a coma somewhere. You're here. There's nothing you can do about it. And what is that? Dreams. They materialize while we're asleep. This way we can remember something from reality. You'll get used to it. Gnome lives there, Tank, then Spirit, Astronomer, me and Phantom. The rest live downstairs. You'll receive clothes and ammo from Tank. You and Phantom are together? What? It's empty. Spend a couple of weeks here and it'll start to take shape. It's yours. Go inside. Usually a newcomer goes through an initiation. But Yan decided to put you here with the squad right away. The man from the balcony. Is he a leader of some sort? He's been living here longer than anybody else. He's left Coma once. That's why we know what this world is like. He taught us how to survive here. We owe him our lives. Including you. OK, get some rest. We'll see what you're made of tomorrow. And Phantom and I are not together. - I didn't mean to... - Even though he thinks we are. That's not how it is. Looks like you really are a phenomenon. Don't even think of going there. Dreams are tricky. You can get lost. You won't be able to get out of there. So, how are you? Are you settling in OK? - I guess so. - Don't bullshit me. Everyone goes crazy at first in here. Listen, I was a little hard on you back there. - No hard feelings, OK? - Yeah, all good. Peace? Peace. You see, Yan is trying to find this island of his. Points out to some chosen ones. It's not my business really. I'm not against it. I have people to take care of. The discipline, subordination... I understand. Got it. Good man. I liked you from the start. You're smarter than the others. So stay away from my girl. I like her. She's acting out. But that's OK. We're almost there. Well, I wouldn't say that. Yan might see something in you. But he's made mistakes in the past. And again, I lead the squad. Not him. We're supposed to be friends, and you're rude. No, I just wanted to say that she should decide for herself. You haven't figured shit out yet. - Stand up. - What for? Stand up, soldier! Chop-chop! Everyone's tired of waiting for you. Some people develop unique abilities here in Coma. It all depends on their way of thinking and predisposition. Spirit, for instance, senses Reapers from afar and invokes ghosts. Astronomer draws the routes. Pilot can locate real people in Coma. In order to discover those abilities, a person needs a push. Needs to be put in danger. Let's see why you are so special. Gnome, launch a half! Hey! Get it together! Do something! So far so bad. But you know, often the abilities... ...flourish in real combat. There, outside. That's how it happened to me, for instance. But we aren't animals who put you in real combat right away. Gnome has built me... ...a training machine. Bring out your dummy, Gnome! I said, bring it out. It's the enemy! Attack! Fight! Fight! You can do it! So you can't act on anything? What did you do for a living? I was an architect, I think. Cable! Take the rookie. We've never had an architect. Afternoon shift! Wake up! Afternoon shift! Get to work! Higher! OK, secure it! Cable! We're going to your submarine to get the explosives. Seems like we've cleared up everything here. Get ready. Yes, Commander! Keep working, Architect. We don't need freeloaders. Hey. Stop sitting around! Who's going to work? Why are you upset? You should be happy, you fool. You're lucky! And why am I lucky? You may not have these valuable super powers, so what? Look, there are plenty of us who didn't pass the test. We were mistakenly picked. At least we don't have to go out there. You'll be safer! So live your life! And you will come out of the coma and continue on your path. But you will have to wait for a while. Time flows differently here. We're not entirely sure, but it seems like... ...it's no less than 1 to 100. One day in reality is equal to several months in Coma. I've been here for 15 years, but you can live here for thousands. The question is, how do you want to spend these thousand years? You saved me. Tell me what my purpose is here? It doesn't matter. Who you want to be is for you to decide. You can move hardware all your life or you can develop your abilities... But sometimes... Sometimes it's hard to recognize them in the beginning. A person can feel like he can do something and then nothing comes out of it. I think I finished a building in town, but I don't know how. I tried to build something here but it didn't work out. Phantom wasn't lying. Abilities can develop out there. We don't put the newbies out there, too risky. But it's a personal choice. In his case... ...it worked: Superhuman strength, speed. He became a leader here. I've seen a lot of people come through here and I think we're here for a reason. Everyone who's here didn't make it in reality. They didn't have a future there. I don't remember anything about myself. Just some fragments of memories. Maybe that's for the best. In which way? Without the heavy burden of memories, we can have a fresh start. Nobody will tell you who you are but yourself. This world is made of our thoughts. - The rules are slightly different here. - Grip it firmly. And here, unlike reality, one can achieve whatever one wants. But that doesn't mean that you should do nothing. The sight doesn't shift anywhere. Got it? - Yeah. - Get your palm closer to you. What do you want? I'm going with you. What? You want to join us? Take the rookie. What the fuck for? Because I said so. He'll get killed. So be it. We have enough people to move hardware. So look... I got it, thanks. Astronomer... Excuse me, can somebody give me a gun? There's Gnome's tunnel. We turn there. Yes! There's my tunnel. I'm sorry, but why is it "Gnome's tunnel"? Because I remember it. And I remember that beauty that we're on our way to see. This world is made up of memories. Sometimes it can be easy to figure out who they belong to. Astronomer has this whole theory about it. Ask him. It's nuts! Tell us, Astronomer. - I heard you have a lot of them? - Dreams? - Yeah, in your room. - Well, yeah. The coma separates consciousness and body. We lose our memories here. We lose ourselves. Get it? - So? - But our dreams hold all the information about what we've remembered during life. Even this place, where we are now, exists there. You can find yourself dreaming there. So that way you can come out of the coma? What are you talking about? Yan told you. Anyone who tries to enter the dreams won't make it. - What's so hard to get? - Doesn't mean it's impossible. Did anyone ask your opinion? Reapers! Nah, nah, nah. It's safe. It's a two-day detour from there. - Can they see us? - They sense us. We emit a signal, a frequency. - That's why I made the whistle. - What whistle? Just in case, so we don't all blow up. - Only one of us. - Like Pilot. You switch on the whistle and it attracts the Reapers. Then you blow yourself up with dynamite. If this world is made of memories, how did they get here? Through us. How? Coma patients. Their brain is dead but life support is still on. The relatives are against turning it off. The dead brain creates them. They die... ...and decay all the time. But they have the ability to turn the living into the same black shit they are made of. I'd rather be taken off the machine than end up like that. Enough of that! Let's go! There's our main attraction! Architect, did you bring spare underwear? Yeah, they're trigger-happy with their guns. - Who? - The guards. - Memories. - Why would they shoot us? They shoot at strangers. That's how I remembered it. OK, take this. Turn this and it'll enhance your bio-signal. It'll attract the Reapers, like bees to honey. - Got it. - Don't worry. There are no Reapers here. But don't start shooting for no reason. You're so boring, Astronomer. We run a greater risk of dying from boredom than from the Reapers. Enough chewing the fat! I'm leading. Tank, stay behind and cover me. Spirit, distract them. The rest of you reserves, stay in the back for your own safety. Any questions? No questions. Let's go! Freeze! Did you work here? What is this place? A lot of factories are mixed up in here. Combined memories of many people. There! There's the hangar! I remember now! There's a secret door. They will leave now. We have 30 seconds to get there. Not yet, Phantom! Phantom! Come on! - Come on! - Freeze! Tank, throw a grenade! - It's too far, I won't make it! - You'll make it! Throw it! Tank! Cover me! Stay back, Tank! Get down! Spirit! Here... What the hell was that! You're going to get us all killed! What the hell do you know? - Relax! - We've summoned the Reapers here! - Spirit? - I can't sense them yet. See? No one's gonna hurt you. If you ever shout at me again, I will break you in half. I'm in charge here! Do you disagree? I can't hear you! Yes! Got it! You OK? I definitely don't recall that. Each of those torpedoes has explosives. That will last for a month. Get to work. On it! Come on, come on! Come on! Easy, easy! Easy! Slowly up! Come on, come on! Let me heal it. It's nothing. Come on. I'll check your hand as well. I said it's nothing! Thanks. Careful! Careful! Hold it tighter! Just a slight knock and it'll blow everything up! Fucking Coma! I recognize this. It's some country... ...but I can't remember which. What's up? Everything is like a dream here, right? A dream. You think you can grasp it... - Reapers! - I told you so. How far? - About a third of a mile! - Get it down! I can't! One more minute! - Get down! - I said one minute! Freaking commander! - I'll finish it myself. - OK. He won't make it. Are you happy now? Hold it for as long as you can, buddy. Got it? Gnome stays here, the rest follow me! - He can't get it down by himself! - Cable is up there! No discussions, obey the order! On three. One, two, three. Run! Stop! Hold it! I said hold it! Run! Come back! - Come on! - Come back! Everyone come back! Fucker! Don't you dare! Move it to the exit. Hurry! So then I look, you guys are running, the stupid thing starts to slide down, dragging me with it. As I'm riding it, I'm thinking, "This is it." But then the sparks, this ramp... Boom! My first thought was, "I'm dead, it exploded." Who the hell knows how you trip out while dying in a coma? Architect, you fool! Why didn't you run like the rest? It was an order. That makes me think... That means you can build a wall where necessary during combat? Yes. And maybe a bridge of sorts? I guess a bridge as well. Attaboy! You will be useful for the unit, Architect. We'll get to places we didn't dare think of before. And I'm thinking... ...there's a better way to use his abilities. We've been looking for a hiding place from the Reapers for a long time. An isolated place. But we couldn't, because people not only remember a place, but how they got there, as well. Isn't that right, Astronomer? But what if the place wasn't created from memory, but rather from imagination. If it's created, designed like that ramp on which Cable fell, then it isn't intertwined with other memories. And therefore safe. I told you, I will bring you to the island. And he will build it for us. You think he can do it? A whole island? Can you? Yes, I can. The best time to deploy is right now. Yan, don't you want to run it by me first? - We need time to prepare. - What do you say, Astronomer? If we're deploying along with the civilians, then we need to pick the safest route. - We haven't had one in a long time. - Hey, theorist! - It's all on paper, Yan. - Didn't we... ...clear all the explosives in the area? Where will we go when we run out? Sooner or later Reapers will see the people through the bus. What then? We leave tomorrow. Astronomer will lead the squad. Yan... Yan, I might've overstepped today, but... You were reckless. Attracted the Reapers. That wasn't the agreement. It's my place! This mission is way too important. Important mission? Maybe they deserve to know something more? We will talk later! Why aren't we drinking? Tomorrow is a big day. Right, Architect? Damn it! What are you doing? Shit, you scared me. Nothing, just trying something. Trying to build? Well yeah, trying. Can I watch? I'm almost done, actually. It's not working out? No, not at all. Why did you tell everyone you'll build that island? Back at the submarine you called everyone back. You weren't sure it would work. You could've killed everyone. But it worked. You've gotten by so far without me... Just figure out what went wrong. Wait! You were concentrated. You did something with your hands and something appeared. Yes, and the ramp appeared. Why are you saying that now? No, the blueprint appeared. Appeared... The blueprint appeared... Yes, I need to imagine the full blueprint. The full blueprint... So, which city should I build for you on my island? They say you have a lot of memories in your room. Well, yeah. I want to see them. Will you show me? How many there are! I've got almost none. Meaning you don't remember anything at all? Only a feeling. Did you get into a car accident? Yes, I was on my way to an important meeting, but it turned out to be a trap. An architect trap? Yeah, I agree, it sounds crazy. And this woman? Were you close? I don't remember, and it's not important anymore. I... - My life is here now. - But you wanted to wake up so much. Yes, yes, I know. But... I met you and I can become myself here. I feel that Yan is right. If we don't remember anything, we can start a life over. And become someone who we've always wanted to be. - Sounds silly, right? - No. I feel the same way. Then you remember something. I do. I couldn't be with the one I wanted. And here I can. During the mission, everyone should strictly follow the leader. Don't deviate, keep your distance. - Will we get guns? - You don't need guns. There are no Reapers on that route. This is where we'll build an island. We will go through the hills. They won't even notice us. What if you missed some of them? I know them all. I've considered each one. Spirit? Seems about right. Usually I sense them... Phantom, listen. Should we take these fuse wires for the explosives? Astronomer is leading the squad. He's the commander now. OK, got it. So, I've got a question. What should I build on this island? You're the architect, so it's up to you. I do have one project, but it's not mine, and the client would be against me borrowing it. I think you can tell him to go to hell now. - Well... - I don't know what kind of project it is, but you, Architect, should build me a custom hut. - With a garage, you know? - And a hot tub for me! - A shooting range for me! - OK, guys, chill! Let's form a line! Reaper! That's impossible. I've checked everything! Are you sure? - I say what I sense. - Damn it. It's always like that with the Reapers. We won't make it far with all this ballast, if at all! Should we turn back? We won't get another chance to get there any time soon, but it's up to you. Phantom. You've got more experience. What do you think? We should split up, check all directions, then return here and choose a new route. Reasonable. Two of us should stay, to protect the others. - Architect and I will stay. - Architect won't be able to help you. He can't shoot, has no experience. You better stay with Tank. - Or I'll stay if you like. - No. Nothing will happen to him! We're just scouting, but we have civilians here. No! I can do it. It's OK. Tank stays here. Architect, get to that hill. When you see a plane, come back right away. Understood? The rest go in your respective direction. Spread out! Tank, what are you doing here? Yan sent me, like he sensed it. Hurry! Reapers! About a thousand feet! We need to leave! - What... - Give me that! - What are you doing? - I said give it to me! Let go of it! Let him go! Where did you get that? - You planted it! - You set us all up! I didn't mean to. We need to leave. Hey! Wait! It's not what you think. You don't know everything. It's... He's the one who... We need to leave. We all need to leave right now. Reapers! Astronomer! Lead everyone away! Listen up everyone! Get rid of the heavy gear! Cable! On your right! Architect, to the bus! Hurry! Astronomer, take him with you! Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! - They responded to the Reaper whistle. - Behind you! This is it, guys. There! Architect! We're almost there. - Were you given an advance payment? - What advance payment? Don't you see? Unlike other idiots, they accepted me and my projects! Yeah, right. They told you how cool you are, how great your projects are and that's it? Have you lost your mind? Do you watch TV? Do you have any idea what they say about your clients? They are using you. They won't pay you. Or even worse, I don't know. There is a way out. The Teacher loves you. Save us! Follow his calling. - Read what the Teacher says about you! - Damn! A path to a new life will open up for you! A new life awaits. Read what the Teacher says about you. He will set you free. - Is that him? - I don't know. You don't know what he looks like? We just talked online, that's it. Zip it! We were told you'd be alone. - But he's not alone! - Calm down. We can only let you in alone. My apologies, we have very strict rules. - Are you the client? - Oh no, of course not. I'm just a simple assistant. It was me who sent you the proposal mail. The Teacher is awaiting you inside. - You aren't going to... - I beg you, please wait for me here. - Hold on. - What? Here, take it. What is it? A hospital? Used to be. We just took it over. Genius. How long have you had this idea? Since university. And people continue building these ugly boxes. Yes, you're absolutely right, it's crazy. I've sent them to many places. To different competitions etc... Pointless. It's pointless to cast pearls before swine. This world will never recognize something unique, even if it's 100 times better. Would you really be able to build what I propose? Follow me, I'll show you something. Pardon me, what exactly does your organization do? You know, there are many rumors. We give people an enlightened new life. You can see it on the billboard. You'll see it for yourself. While studying the cerebral physiology of the brain, I discovered that in a state of a deep coma, one has access to a whole world that no one else knows about. This world is much better than the common reality. Do you mean dreams? It's impossible to explain. Would you like to take a look? I'm in a hurry, I've got things to do. It won't take long. I'm sure you'll like it! Get off! Stay away! - What happened? - Come on! Go! Go! Go! I just ran a person over! - Drive! Drive! Drive! - I told you they were lying! Why don't you listen to me! Why can't you ever listen to me! She was put in a coma just a couple of hours before you. But there, months have passed. Extraordinary, isn't it? Who the hell are you? A group of scientists who want to gift people a new world. And the spiritual teachings? To help to finance the project. My studies were deemed a failure, so I had to find a way. As a wise man said, "If you want to get rich, create your own religion." You know, by the way, it was much easier than I thought. - So my city project is a lie? - Of course not! The city is real. I've formed a team of people with specific brain pathologies, so they could survive in a coma. I found an artist with an amazing memory and imagination, so he could work on a worthy project and realize it there. What for? Don't you get it? To live there. In dreams? The coma world was known to people long before us. Ancient rulers of many cultures went there. But modern technology plastered it with walking corpses of Reapers. And all these people found a new meaning there, a new life. Even you were almost happy there. There, you are the great architect. And what awaits you here? Custom cottages. If you're lucky. Did they get the same injection as me? It's faster and better for them. Maybe you should have asked them first! You know, Phantom's memory was fully recovered. He remembered how he got here and who he was. But he didn't want to wake up. Later a Reaper got to him. On a physiological level it's a necrosis of brain tissue. He panicked, started to threaten us that he would reveal the truth. In the end he killed a bunch of people and almost screwed up everything. It took some effort to get you out of there. So the more you know, really, the more problems arise. And... all of your followers, will you take them with you to Coma? We need them to create a mode of life. Slaves. But they don't know that they will be put into a coma, right? In return I give people an infinite life full of meaning. What's wrong with that? Everyone gets what they want in Coma. One person is a commander or spiritual leader, another person is a great architect. You are crazy! Don't you understand these are just dreams? It doesn't matter. Look... That's it, I'm out of here. Just let us go, please, that's all. Knowledge is the source of all problems. You will still accomplish what is required. I won't go back there anymore. You know, when a Reaper gets a person, their brain dies in a couple of minutes. Did you leave her in a field? Strange. For now... For now it seems normal. But it's impossible to see everything... Enough! Let her go! She's not a part of this! I invited you alone. You started the race and crashed. You did this to yourself, and to her. Either way, you're building the island and your city on it. Then I will let you both go. You will let all of us go! I give you my word, I won't hold anyone back. You will wake up in your home again. The brain is drawn to the strongest memories. This time, your memory will recover much faster. You will find Astronomer. The coordinates for building the city are on his map. What if I don't make it? You will. This stimulant will make your brain work more intensely. Sure, it will damage your health, but you'll be like Superman for a while. Wait, how will they know when it's time to get out of Coma? They won't. Well, there is a way. From within. A back door of sorts. I'll show you once you've accomplished everything. Think about it. I was able to leave. Sleep. Get down! That's it. That's the last one. Leave it with us. Yeah... It's not what you think. We need to leave. Hurry. A lot of people resist it in the beginning. Maybe you should give him some more time. No. Do as I say. Here it is. Yan chose this place himself. He said it was majestic. What's wrong? Are you hurt? It's nothing. I'm just tired. I will live on this island for some time. Soon... I can't believe it. Yan was right after all. Don't you get it? We are all laying in that lunatic's basement. There will be no island! It's just a dream! I know it's hard to comprehend, but when you see it with your own eyes, how you're laying there... So you told them after all. They've been through so much already. It's not very fair. Where do you want it? The bridge should start right here. "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good." What do you need reality for after this? Yan, I've built everything. Let us go. Spirit. In life you saw dead people all around you... ...and had seizures a couple of times a day. You don't have any relatives, and you lost your only child. I saved you from the asylum, where you would have rotted till your dying day. Tank. You lost your family in an accident. Became a raging alcoholic. Started shooting at your neighbors. You would have ended up in a madhouse or a jail. Astronomer, you're autistic. You can't even leave your house. Your poor old folks. What will happen when they die? And you have a more serious issue, Architect. Your ideas are beautiful, but way ahead of their time, so no one wants them. Everyone has abandoned you, including her, who was by your side till the very end. He is nothing out there. An infantile, unrecognized genius who lets all his anger out on you, on the whole world. I bet you contemplated suicide long before you got that email. This project gave new meaning to your life. - Were you given an advance payment? - What advance? Don't you see? Unlike other idiots, they accepted me and my projects! Keep laughing. Everything will change for us after this, I know it. For us? There is no "us". That's why you're sitting in this car. Jesus! They told you how cool you are, how great your projects are, and that's it? - Have you lost your mind? - You used to believe in me. They are using you, they won't pay you. - Or even worse, I don't know. - Got a guilty conscience? This is a great car. I'm sure it was a gift, considering you're just a nurse. But that's OK. I'll buy you a new one when I'm famous. This is the last time I'm helping you. We're staying. Stay. But now I won't let you stay. I can't. You would reveal everything. - And who's going to believe us? - My followers. You can't hide it forever. And in heaven, there is no place for those who know the secret of its creation. It concerns you as well. Now that you know everything, I can't let you live among the others. We won't tell anyone. It's done. You are suffocating there. Brain oxygen starvation has started and you will feel it soon. I don't know in which order you were switched off. There, it's a matter of seconds, but here we've got about fifteen minutes to say our goodbyes. Stop! I was prepared for this. Brain stimulation can be harmful, but I thought it wouldn't hurt in this situation. I have business to attend to. Damn it! You warned me that they would fuck me over. - What? - We need to wake up. We will wake up and switch him off. The back door! Astronomer! How did he escape when the Reapers attacked? Dreams. All of us are dreaming where we are laying right now. If you can find yourself in that dream, then... That's why he said that dreams are dangerous! - They are dangerous. - Let's go! - It's not that easy! - We don't have much time, Astronomer! Spirit, let's go! Come on. Astronomer, we need to get to Yan's room. Hurry! They are already there. - We won't make it! - Shit! I've got an idea. Come on! Hurry! - What? - It's not how I remember it. These are dreams, I told you. We need to try harder to find that place. Everything is mixed up here. Then there, I think. There was a door and stairs. It's not the same! Astronomer? Everything is linked by association in here. Try not to search according to the blueprint of the rooms. How? Details! Search for a detail that reminds you of that room. A detail... Yes, here it is. It was in a painting in that room! Right. I was right. Of course you're right. Astronomer is a genius after all. Where would we be without him? Our memory retains the things we find most interesting. And of all things, you remembered a temple in a painting. A true architect. You know, I really hoped you'd be smarter than the rest. You reminded me of myself when I was young. Medicine fights to prolong a human's life for five more years. But I was able to prolong it for a thousand. And you know what? My department was closed, to finance the development of a new anti-cellulite product. And I never understood how to live in a world so foolish, so ugly. But then I realized there is another world. I discovered it. Fly, run! But just like you, I had my doubts. It's just an illusion after all. I thought so, until I made a discovery. Everything that we live for, all of our emotions... Joy, happiness, anger, astonishment, sadness... They are all simply electrical signals of our brain. We measured them on people in a coma and in real life, and you know what? They are absolutely identical. Life in Coma is as real as it gets. That's it. It's as simple as that. We found it, Fly. Come on. Come on. Quiet. Quiet. Breath. Breath. Breath. Quiet. What... We're going home. Everything is going to be alright. We're going home. We're going. Stand up. Well, I'm almost done, but I need a break. - Let's take Torik out for a walk. - Alright, let's go. What about your projects? Did anyone reply? No. Maybe that's down to the presentation. No, everything is fine. You just have to be realistic. My projects are worthless. But at least this year will be better financially. We won the contract. - Are you kidding? - No. Congratulations. It looks like the scandal involving the Foundation of Eternal Life will end without a result, after all. All charges will be dropped due to a lack of evidence, as it was established that all subjects of the experiment were there legally. The organization continues to successfully recruit followers... Do you think they will come for us? We have nothing to be afraid of. Get dressed. By the way, the mail came this morning. There was an envelope for you. - Yeah, I saw it already. - What was in it? Nothing special. Just some documents for an old project.
