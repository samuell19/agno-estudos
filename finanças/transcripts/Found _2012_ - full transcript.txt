[ Boy Narrating ] My brother keeps a human head in his closet. Every few days it's a new head. Usually, they are black women. But one time he had a white man's head in there. I was going bowling with my friend David one day... And I needed to borrow Steve's ball. He wasn't home, so I took it without asking permission. That's a big no-no. When I opened the bag at the bowling alley, I almost cried. I didn't tell anyone about it, and I used David's ball instead. I lied and said the one I brought was too heavy for me. I'm surprised they couldn't smell it. It's another black woman's head, And her hair has been ripped out. I've seen lots of horror movies, And the heads in those things don't come close to looking like the real thing. I can't explain what it feels like to hold one of them. At one point it had thoughts and feelings... And it kissed somebody it loved. Now it's just a bloody head in a bowling ball bag. I hope I don't end up that way. If Steve found out I was in his room, he'd probably kill me too. I worry about him finding out. What if I put the head back in the bag facing the wrong direction? If he's a killer, he probably thinks about things like that, Because he's crazy. The first person he would blame would be me. Big brothers blame little brothers for everything. Dad says that's just the way it is. [ Woman ] Marty! Didn't you hear me yelling for you? I was upstairs. What are you working on? Me and David are making a graphic novel. Like a comic book? David said they are graphic novels. What are graphic novels? Does that mean that they're really graphic? It just means they use pictures. Anyway, me and David have each been working on a superhero. See? Here's mine... Bag Lunch. And here's Roach man. David drew him. Hmm. We take turns drawing the backgrounds. Tonight I get to draw the blood. Marty! What? I wish you could get interested in things that weren't so horrible. You know those movies used to keep you up at night. I'm not five anymore. I'm 12. God! [ Door Opens ] Hi to you too. I said hi. Get your things off the table before your dad gets home. [ Marty Narrating ] I wish my mom wouldn't worry about what I watched or drew. The only reason she cares is because of a picture I drew in art class last year. My teacher freaked out about it, So Mom had to come to school and talk about it. I guess some people are afraid that if a kid watches horror movies, He'll grow up to be a killer or a psycho. But I'm not a violent person. I don't even like killing bugs. I get good grades and I do what people tell me to, so they just shouldn't worry. Dad tells Mom all boys are interested in horror movies and graphic novels. He says it's normal, and that I'll grow out of it someday. But if that's true, then I don't wanna ever grow up. Not ever. [ Man ] Marty. Marty. Marty! Hmm? Sorry. That must have been one heck of a daydream. What if we went bowling this weekend? I have to work this weekend. Maybe next weekend. [ Man ] You have to work this weekend? Everyone's working overtime. It's mandatory. Well, I guess it's just you and me, kiddo. And Steve. And Steve. Can we go see a movie? As long as it's not a horror movie. Let's try something different for a change. I'm sure we can find something family-oriented. There's oil on the driveway again. - I asked you to park on the street. - I do. Our cars don't leak. Just your piece of crap does. I didn't park on the driveway. Don't ignore me, Son! That's your oil in the driveway. [ Steve ] It's not my problem if you don't believe me. [ Dad ] Not my problem? If you're gonna live here, You're gonna have to respect our wishes. [ Steve ] I pay rent, so why don't you respect mine and leave me alone? [ Dad ] Don't you close that door on me! We're not finished, mister! [ Steve ] What do you want from me? What do I want? It's too late for what I want. I wanted you to not flunk out of school. I wanted you to make something of your life! [ Mouths Words ] - [ Steve ] I have a job! - You call that a job? Working in a factory? That's a monkey job! You honestly expect me to believe... That you'll be happy working there the rest of your life? It's my life, so stay out of it! [ Mouths Words ] If you weren't living in my house and messing up my driveway! It's my house, Son! If I find any more oil, I'll have that trash heap towed away! [ Door Slams ] Oh, goddamn it! [ Man On Radio ] Welcome back to WTNS... And Mysteries of the Unexplained. Tonight we're talking about he who lives deep, deep, And I mean deep into the woods, As we discuss all things Sasquatch. You know, Bigfoot, the Yeti... And quite possibly my great Uncle Teddy. If it is hairy and scary and you saw it, pick up the phone. We wanna hear your story. [ Whispering ] Marty. I can see your light in the hallway. Better shove some clothes under the door so Mom doesn't see. Okay. Hello. You're on the air. [ Woman ] Yeah. Hello. Yes. You're on the air. Well, I just wanted to say... Me and my husband heard of Bigfoot down here in Kentucky... Way back... I think it was 1978. Yeah, he was making the rounds quite a bit back in the late 1970s. Yeah, uh, me and my husband... [ Marty Narrating ] It's weird for Steve to talk to me, But I guess he still wants to do the big brother thing sometimes. David! Hey, I got the coloring done. Wanna see? Sure. Hey, David! Come on! Um, how about later? Okay. After school? Sure. I'll meet you at the junkyard. Cool. See ya. See ya. All right! Everybody get in line! Nice lunch box, Marty. Did your mommy pick that out for you? Yeah, only babies watch cartoons. Are you still a baby, Marty? Marcus Sanders, do you want after-school detention? Miss Thomas, Marcus flipped you off. [ Giggles ] Be quiet. [ Girls Giggle ] Did you stick up your middle finger, Marcus Sanders? After-school detention for a week. And no recess either. - What? - You heard me. [ Girls Gasp ] Quiet! All right, from this moment on, While we're in the hallways and the restrooms, there will be no talking. Anyone who talks will get after-school detention... And, as a punishment, will write a very long sentence on the chalkboard 1,000 times. [ Girls Giggle ] 1,000 times? Andy just got after-school detention. - But... - And no recess either. Anyone else? [ Giggles ] [ Miss Thomas ] Good. You were in there an awfully long time, George. Marty? [ Marcus ] Is that you, Marty? Why don't you use the urinals like the rest of us? You're afraid we'll see how small your dick is? - Open up, Martin. - Go away! Open up, or I'll kick your ass. - He's got a tiny dick. - He's got a little one? [ Marcus ] An itty bitty. I never saw one so little. Levi, get in there. - You guys are fags. - [ Marcus ] Yeah, right. [ Groans ] [ Marcus ] Fucker. [ Coughing ] Marcus Sanders, what did you do? He called me a fag. They crawled under his stall and they tried to look at his thing. [ Marcus ] You shut up, you little runt. - His what? - [ Boy ] You know. Is that true? [ Footsteps ] Do you wanna talk about it? No. I wish I could take the rest of the day off with you, but I got to get back to work. Can David spend the night tomorrow? Please. We haven't had a movie night in a long time. All right. But you got to give me a kiss. [ Engine Starts ] [ Car Drives Off ] [ Marty Narrating ] Mom says everybody has their private things... And nobody likes having their secrets exposed. But I can't help it. For Mom, It's a box of old love letters from some man named Danny. I try to read some of them, but they're really cheesy. I guess Mom must have really loved Danny... If she kept his letters for so long. It makes me wonder why she didn't marry him instead of Dad. Dad keeps his secrets in the garage. Dad's magazines aren't like Mom's. Hers are about gardening and keeping your house looking pretty. Dad's are full of naked women with big boobs. I wonder if she knows Dad has these magazines. I'll bet she'd be really mad... If she found out he likes to look at them. I'll have to remember that in case Dad makes me mad. [ Spits ] ** [ Heavy Metal ] ** [ Continues ] - What the fuck are you doing? - ** [ Stops ] Your door was unlocked. And that gives you permission to come inside? Give me that. Don't you ever come in here without my permission. You hear me? I'm sorry. I won't. Why are you home so early anyway? Some kid punched me at school. You punch him back? No. Why not? I don't know. Well, why'd they punch you? I was in the boys' bathroom and Marcus came in and started bothering me. What'd he do? He tried to look at my... You know. He tried to look at your dick? He didn't see it. But he told everyone I had a small one. - You didn't do anything about it? - I called him a faggot. Good. That's good. But then he punched me. The principal said I could go home. Next time, you got to punch him back. But I'll get in trouble. Look, do you wanna be the kid that gets picked on... Or the kid that gets in trouble? I mean, what's the worst that could happen? What'd they do to this Marcus kid? Couple of Saturday detentions. See? That's nothing compared to what he did to you. Nothing. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I didn't mean to yell at you like that. If you wanna listen to music in my room, Just ask first, okay? Okay, I will. It's okay. [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Steve ] Marty? Yeah? Which Marcus was it? Marcus Sanders. - ** [ Carnival ] - [ Evil Laughter ] [ Screaming ] ** [ Continues ] [ Evil Laughter ] David! [ Laughing ] [ Laughing Continues ] I got you good, you got to admit. Get that out of my face. Wanna see something really scary? My mom said you could spend the night tomorrow if you want to. It's this way. There it is. Tell me it's not real. No way. I heard that Old Lady Baker lost her child about 20 years ago, And I bet this might be it. Let me see the coloring that you did. Cool. This is good stuff. So do you wanna spend the night tomorrow? We'll watch a movie and keep working on our graphic novel some more. Yeah, I guess so. So you heard about what happened at school today? I heard. What did they say? Marcus told everyone that you have a small dick... And that he beat the shit out of you in the bathroom for trying to kiss him. He said I tried to kiss him? Yeah. Levi too. And they told everyone. I can't believe it. They didn't even see anything, and now they're spreading lies about me. You know Marcus. He's a dick hole. [ Man ] I see the lights on in there. I know you kids are in there. I told you, boys. Stay the hell off my property! It's dangerous! Get the hell out of there! I see your shadows moving in there! I'm gonna come in there! - [ Dad ] Great. Another degenerate nigger. - Stan! I'll stop calling them that when they stop acting like it. Marty, don't listen to him. So what'd they do to this little pervert that hit you? Saturday detention for two weeks. That's it? Unbelievable. Marty, if you want to, you can stay home from school tomorrow. [ Stan Sighs ] Really? Give us some time to clean up, and we'll go rent some movies, And I'll pick up a pizza for you and David on my way home from work tomorrow. You've had a rough day. No one should have to go through something like that. Marty. [ Marty ] This one seems to be empty. Yeah, if it's not in there, it's either lost or stolen. Sorry, kid. [ Man On Radio ] We are off to a disturbing start to this evening's show. [ Woman ] But people have to know exactly what I went through that night. It could happen to anyone. I mean, those Grays were rough. ** [ Thunder Crashes ] [ Knocking ] Steve, are you awake? I need a flashlight. Can I borrow yours? Steve. [ Thunder Rumbles ] [ Scraping ] [ Steve ] What the fuck? I thought I left the goddamn lights on. [ Light Switch Clicks ] Why the fuck do the lights have to go out tonight? Because I fucking need to find something, that's why. Where the hell is it? It must have rolled under the bed. Come on, come on, where is it? [ Thunder Rumbles ] Can you handle this? I can handle anything you got. [ Thunder Crashes ] [ Groans ] Mom? Dad? [ Steve ] They're not home. They left for work already. [ Sighs ] You look tired. The storm kept me up all night. Me too. Why aren't you at work? I'm getting ready to leave. What time do you think it is anyway? I don't know. My clock was blinking this morning. It's not even 8:00 yet. You got the whole day ahead of you. So, what are you gonna do? Watch movies. Mom took me to the video store. - Get anything good? - Deep Dwellers and Death Rattlers. Death Rattlers is pretty cool. It's about a motel where guys go to screw zombie chicks. Hey, you're bleeding. Shit. Steve? Yeah. What if I hit Marcus back? What if it just makes him more mad? What if it doesn't hurt him any? What if it doesn't hurt him at all? What if he just keeps beating me up? I don't think I can do it. Don't worry about Marcus. Today's your day off. You shouldn't worry about anything. Hey, while you're gone, can I go through your movie collection? David's spending the night tonight, And I was wondering if we could watch Hellraiser again. All right, but only 'cause you asked this time. - Be careful with my shit. - I will. If you like Hellraiser, watch Nightbreed. It's Clive Barker too. Bunch of freaky monsters running around in a graveyard. You'll like it. [ Marty Narrating ] This is the Steve I miss... normal Steve. Why do there have to be two Steves? [ Sighs ] Rodney! What? Come rub some lotion on me. In a minute. [ David ] Man, he'd be jumping out of that water to rub her down. This movie's not very realistic. [ Marty ] Maybe she asks him to rub her down all the time. Maybe he's tired of it. Look at her. How can you get tired of that? - Rodney! - Damn it, woman! What do you want? Here we go. Marty! You missed the boobs. Eh. They'll be back. Oh, hey, I came up with a new character... Carnival Sin. I came up with him during math class. Cool. I like it. Your strap's kind of in the way. Then take it off. Anything happen at school today? Not really. Marcus wasn't even there. [ Screaming ] [ Screeching ] I have another movie we can watch after this. What is it? Headless. My brother stole it from the video store. He stole it? Yeah. Is it gross? I don't know. I haven't seen it yet. What's it rated? Unrated. Unrated? [ Whimpering ] [ Screaming ] Help! This is stupid, isn't it? I don't know. Somebody help me! [ Sobbing ] [ Screams ] No! No! No! [ Sobbing Continues ] Help! Help! Help! Somebody, help me! Help me! No, no, no, no! No! Please don't! No, no, no! No! Please stop! Please stop! Oh, no, no! [ Screams ] Gross. That's great. [ Sobbing ] [ Screaming ] No! [ Spits ] [ Spitting Continues ] [ David Laughing ] Your brother's really sick. [ Flesh Squishing ] Man, that head looks so fake. Are you okay? This is gross. You big pussy. Maybe you should stick to PG-13 horror movies. Shut up. What the... [ Chuckles ] [ Grunting ] Yeah! [ Yells ] [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] At least that's pretty cool. - What? - The makeup. Oh. Yeah. Are you shaking? No. Yes, you are. You're scared. No, I'm not. [ Singsongy ] Little Marty's afraid. Cut it out. Just watch the movie. All right. Just try not to shit yourself. Why are you teasing me? I'm just playing. Chill out. [ Muffled Screaming ] [ Marty Narrating ] The idea that Steve uses this movie for inspiration... Makes me feel dirty. [ Screaming ] [ Both Screaming ] No! I imagine Steve doing all the things the killer does in the movie. [ Crying ] No! I wonder if he wears a mask. I wonder if he uses a machete to kill his victims. I wonder if he eats their eyes. Did this movie turn my brother into a killer? Will it make me wanna kill people too? I think I'm a little smarter than that. Besides, I can't even defend myself against bullies in the school bathroom. How would I ever have enough courage to take a knife out and end someone's life? [ Wailing ] [ Wailing Continues ] Freeze! [ Gunshots ] That's it? Weak. Really fuckin' weak. That was the weakest horror movie I've ever seen. It didn't even have a story. It's a slasher. It doesn't have to have a story. Well, I don't care what it was. Why in the hell did we watch it? I thought it was going to be good. You thought wrong. What's wrong with you? I'm bored. I thought we were gonna have fun tonight. I thought we were. You wanna watch another movie? I don't think you can handle another one. Told you I wasn't scared. Yeah, you are. You're lying. No, I'm not. You couldn't stop shaking during the whole thing. Maybe Marcus and Levi were right. What? Maybe you do have a small penis. What did you say? I said maybe you do have a small dick. [ Sniffles ] Are you crying? You wanna see something really scary? A bowling ball bag? Are you kidding me? It's not the bowling ball bag. It's what's inside. Like the movie, right? I guess there's a head in there. Maybe. And I guess you want me to open it. If you want to. I'm not making you. Oh, man. What did your brother do, Take a shit in this thing? Scared? Fuck you. This is the last time I'll spend the night with you. Why are you being mean? You wanna know why? It's hard being your friend, Marty. Everyone makes fun of you. And when you're not there, they make fun of me. You know what that's like? Yeah. I know what it's like. It sucks. I'm tired of taking up for you. Nobody asked you to. Good. 'Cause I don't want to be your fuckin' friend anymore. I'm not like you, Marty. I'm not a fag. Then open the fuckin' bag. You want me to fuckin' open it? Fine. Is that... Marcus? You scared? Please tell me you're fucking with me. This is a joke, right? No. Steve kills people all the time. Look at it. No! Look at it or I'll tell Steve. You know why Steve did this? Please. I'm sorry. Because Marcus punched me. He told lies about me. He was picking on me! I won't pick on you. I promise. I won't tell anyone. You're just like Marcus. - I won't do it again. - Good. I think I'm gonna be sick. Go to the bathroom. Don't throw up in my room. [ Thinking ] I lost my only friend. My best friend. When I go back to school on Monday, I won't have anyone to talk to. Not anyone. [ David Retching ] Be quiet. What's wrong? We were watching a movie and he started feeling sick. Are you all right, David? Can you call my mom? All right, honey. I'll be right back. Go get his things ready. [ Zipping ] ** [ Speakers: Heavy Metal ] ** [ Continues ] His parents are on their way. Are you okay? I'm sick. [ Woman ] Thanks for calling. Come on, David. Good night. Good night. Hope you feel better, David. [ Thinking ] Steve knows. He knows that I know his hobby. He knows that I know about the heads. And he knows David knows. I just hope Steve won't hurt me. Why would he? I'm his little brother. He's my big brother. It's David that should have to worry. But I might have to worry too. Nobody is safe... Not now that Steve knows. [ Mutters ] [ Scratching ] [ Scratching Stops ] [ Footsteps Passing ] Hey. We still going to the movies this morning? Yeah. Okay. You all right? Yeah. It's just allergies. Okay. [ No Audible Dialogue ] What happened to David last night? He got sick. You okay? You two fighting? He's gets picked on. He doesn't want to hang out with me anymore. That's bullshit. That kid's no good anyway. What time is it? It's about 10 minutes till the show starts. Gotta go to the bathroom. [ Knocks ] [ Tapping ] I'm in here. [ Knocking ] I'm in here. Go to another stall. [ Banging ] - [ Steve ] Open the stall, Marty. - Steve? Open it or I'll kick it open. I'm trying to use the bathroom. Open the fucking door. Did you tell Dad? Tell him what? Don't fucking play stupid with me. I didn't tell him anything. Are you sure? Have you told anyone? Nobody. I promise. You say one more word and you're dead. You hear me? You'll be dead. What about David? Did he see it? Yes. But I warned him. What? I told him you'd kill him if he told anyone. If he does, he's dead. I'm not fucking around. I know you're not. You really fucked up, kiddo. You really fucked up. How long have you known? How long? Is there something wrong? Mind your own fucking business. We're not done. I'll see you tonight. Man, that guy's an asshole. He's my brother. [ Movie: Grunting, Groaning ] [ Woman Screams ] It just started. That reporter said zombies were going to be everywhere, And now... [ Chuckles ] zombies are everywhere. Hmm? You okay? My belly hurts. Try not to get sick in the car. I can pull over if you need to, okay? Don't worry about your car. I'll be fine. I'm not worried about the car, Marty. [ TV: Laughter ] [ Man On TV ] Elizabeth, look at me. Did you buy the lobster? [ Woman ] Yes. Did you bring it home? Yes. Marty? Marty? Marty? Marty? Come on, Marty. I know you're here. You always come here. I can see you. I just want to talk to you. Leave me alone! Just get off. Get away from me. I told you a million times not to go in my room without asking. I know. I'm sorry. Have you told anyone else? No. Just David. He won't tell anyone. I told him you'd kill him. It's not like that. Then what is it like? It's the niggers. It's like Dad says. They're infesting everything. The fucking mall, Mom's church, the factory, The fucking government. I can't get away from them. You probably hate them as much as I do. What about Marcus? He punched you. But that was just him. They're all the same. They're nothing. They're dirt. I can't let David mess things up. If he says anything, you know what I have to do. What about me? I could never hurt you, Marty. Really? Never. Thank you for killing Marcus. Anything for my little brother. [ Mom ] Hurry up. We're going to be late. [ Engine Starts ] [ Marty Thinking ] I don't believe in God anymore. God wouldn't let one of his children be treated this way... Especially me. I'm always good at church. I'm always good at school. I'm quiet and I get good grades. And I'm always the one that gets treated bad. So how can I believe in God? Hey, good morning. How are you? Good morning. Great, thank you. Have a wonderful time. - Hey, Marty, how are you doing? - I'm fine. [ Man ] The Biblical virtue of perseverance... Is very, very rare today. It runs counter to most people's mind-sets. Perseverance takes a long-term perspective, [ Clicking ] Rather than focusing on the immediate present. - Perseverance is patient. - [ Clicking Continues ] It keeps waiting, it keeps trusting, it keeps believing, Even when things take longer than expected. Perseverance is important. Where are you going? I gotta go to the bathroom. Well, hurry back. As well as to the true nature of God. I heard about you at school. It's true, isn't it? Perseverance in the midst of trial... Reveals to us who we are, and it also reveals to us who God truly is. Fuckin' homo. Watch your step. Does Pastor Donald know what you are? Does your mom? Huh? Answer me. Say something, faggot. Fucking little faggot pussy boy. We have only to keep believing. We have only to keep praying. We have only to persevere. [ Woman Screams ] - Stop! Help! - [ Groaning ] [ Pastor Donald ] Stop it! Stop it! Stop! [ Woman ] Help! Oh, my God! [ Sobbing ] You did this! This is all your fault. Can't you control your child? [ Thinking ] I'm going to get in trouble for this. [ Woman ] Oh, God. I'm going to get in trouble, And I don't care. Marty, would you like to talk to me? Would you like to tell me what happened out here? Because we'd really like to know. Marty, we're really concerned for you. Your mom says you've been having trouble at school lately. You really hurt Trevor. Did you see his face? He shouldn't have picked on me and called me names. Did you ask him to stop? I ask him every week, but it doesn't do any good. Have you told your mom about this? No. She doesn't listen. She doesn't notice anything important. Marty, you can't go around just beating people up... If they say something you don't like. He started it. Not me. Two wrongs do not make a right. You're a smart young man. You must know this. Then what was I supposed to do? You tell an adult. That never helps. But did you even try? No, because it doesn't matter. Marty, we're not out to get you. We're just trying to make sure that this never, ever happens again in the future. Will you promise me the next time someone does or says anything that hurts you, You will tell an adult? Marty? Some people say you should stick up for yourself. Never with violence. Do you understand? Never with violence. You cannot solve your problems by fighting. You have to sit down and talk it out. It's the only way. Marty, would you... Do you think you would like to apologize to Trevor now? No. He should apologize to me. It's his fault. - It's both your faults. You can't... - No, I'm right. I finally stuck up for myself and maybe he won't do it anymore. And what if it happens again? Then I'll beat him into a tree again. That is not what I wanted to hear. Marty, I need to know that you won't do this again. I can't tell you that. It makes me sad... To see such a young man so angry. What do you say? Sorry. Like you mean it. I'm sorry. Do you have something you'd like to say? Do it again and I'll beat you up again. Come on, let's get out of here. I can't take this anymore. - My son apologizes, and your son threatens him? - [ Mom ] What? I hope you know what kind of son you're raising. Wait. Get over here right now. What do you mean, telling her you'd beat her son up again. What's wrong with you? Sorry. Like you mean it, young man. [ Marty Thinking ] I'm tired of people always winning and me always losing. From now on, I'm going to make sure I always win. Looking at what I've done to Trevor makes me feel proud. Instead of getting hit and taking it like a wimp, I stood up for myself and did some damage of my own. It may not have been as bad as what Steve does, but it's good enough for me. I hope you go to hell. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Door Opens ] I have never been so embarrassed in my life. You are in big trouble when we get home, mister. What was I supposed to do? Let him keep beating me up? You didn't have to do what you did, Marty. Kids get picked on. I'm sorry it happens, but it's not an excuse to attack someone. You don't know anything. You don't even know what goes on in your own house. - What? - Do you even know how to be a mom? You messed up Steve and now you're messing up me. How dare you. How dare you speak to me like that. [ Thinking ] She's just like the rest of them. But she won't win this time. She won't see me cry. I just got off the phone with Trevor's parents. Care to explain yourself, young man? Because it looks like you're in some deep shit. He was picking on me. So you beat him up? Yeah, I did. - Stanley! - Shut up. Stay out of this. How did that feel, huh? Did it hurt? No! You could have killed that boy. Then what, huh? What then? I don't care. He got what he deserved. You could have killed that boy. This ain't a game, Son. They're probably gonna sue us, 'Cause his face is cut and gonna have to have stitches. This is serious! No, I'm serious! I'm tired of people pushing me around. Why don't they get in trouble? Why don't they get smacked? You guys are assholes. You don't care about me. - Don't you hit him again. - You need to shut your mouth. No. Marty's been through enough. Leave him alone. I don't recall asking you a goddamn thing. I'm not kidding, Dad. Leave him alone and go back to your TV. [ Chuckles ] Please. Get the fuck out of here. You touch me again, And you'll regret it for the rest of your fuckin' life. Oh, really? What are you gonna do? - [ Steve Grunting ] - [ Mom ] Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! [ Dad ] Get out. Get out now. Touch Marty again, and it'll be a lot worse. Get out, and never come back here. Marty! [ Thinking ] My life is starting to feel like a horror movie. But who's the monster? Is it Dad? Is it Steve? Is it me? [ Man On Radio ] Joan from Regal Park, You're on Mysteries of the Unexplained. [ Woman ] Am I on? This show is trash. You are trash! Am I on? [ Tapping ] Honey, I'm not sure what you're on tonight. You should be ashamed... [ Tapping ] and I hope you suffer when your time comes. I know you will, in blood and tears. And I will look down on you with no pity. No pity. I mean, what if children listen to this show? Did you ever stop to think about that? Are they asleep? They went to bed an hour ago. Where are you staying? Don't worry about me. I'll get a motel or something. What about you? Have they bothered you any more? I just went to sleep without supper, that's all. Steve? What are you going to do? I need you to stay in my room tonight. Why? I need your bed. It's stronger than mine. No, yours is stronger. I've jumped on both of them. Mine is really old. Yours is in better condition. Why do you need it? Just stay in there tonight. Please. But I have school in the morning. I just want to sleep in my own bed. I'm asking you nicely, Marty. Just stay in there tonight. Please. No. Listen to me. Something is going to happen tonight that's going to change everything, And I need you to stay out of the way. Why? Because I don't want to hurt you. Are you going to hurt Mom and Dad? Are you? They hate us, Marty. Dad treats you like shit. Mom treats you like a baby. Aren't you tired of it? What are you going to do? I'm going to free you. I'm going to free both of us. They're bad people, Marty. But I don't want you to kill them. Please don't. Please don't make this any harder. I don't want anything to happen to you. I'll call the cops. Don't even joke like that. I swear. They'll lock you away forever. You wouldn't do that to me. I'm your brother. If you were my brother, you wouldn't do this to me. You're just like Marcus and David. You're just like Dad. Don't fuck with me. I need to do this. I need this. Get off! Somebody help! Say one more word and I'll fucking gut you. What the hell is going on out here? Stay outta this. Oh, you've got some nerve. You're not even supposed to be here. And why are you out of your room? Huh? I asked you a question. Leave him alone! He was just trying to help his brother. Oh, piss on that. I'm calling the fucking cops. - No! - [ Steve Grunts ] [ Groaning ] [ Screams ] [ Gagging, Coughing ] Oh, my God. Stanley. [ Gasps ] [ Grunting ] Stop! Steve! [ Mom, Faint ] Please! Don't! No, Steve! Dad? [ Mom, Groans, Screams ] [ Groaning, Whimpering ] [ Laughing ] No! No! No! [ Grunts ] [ Shouts ] [ Marty Thinking ] Everything I used to love about my brother is gone. This isn't Steve. This is a stranger wearing Steve's skin. And I have to stop him. No! [ Both Grunting, Groaning ] Marty... ** [ Electronic ] [ Mom Sobbing, Faint ] [ Screams ] [ Coughing ] [ Sobbing, Screaming Continues ] [ Dad ] I'm trying, Lisa. Lisa? Lisa. I'm coming, baby. [ Steve ] Love it. Love it! Love it! [ Dad ] Lisa! I'm coming, honey! [ Marty Whimpers ] [ Dad, Mom Continue, Faint ] [ Marty Sobbing, Coughing ] Don't try to talk. You'll gag. Please. [ Dad ] I'm coming, baby. I'm coming. [ Marty ] Oh, please. [ Mom ] Help! Stanley. Please! Help me! No! [ Mom ] Oh, Stanley, help! Help, Stanley! [ Dad ] Come get me loose, you piece of shit! [ Mom Screams ] Oh, please, he's going to kill me, Stanley! [ Screaming ] [ Dad ] I'm coming, baby. I'm coming! [ Mom ] No! No. No. Please don't. [ Mom Screaming, Gurgling ] Steve. [ Dad ] Lisa? Lisa! Lisa? [ Steve ] She's dead, Daddy! No. Cut me loose, you piece of shit. Now! You want to see? If you ever touch your mother, I will beat you down. Do you understand, you piece of shit? [ Shouts ] Say good night to Mommy, Daddy. - [ Dad Sobbing ] No! - No. You piece of shit! How could you do that to your mother? My, God. I will fucking kill you! [ Sobs ] Come here! Fight me like a man. [ Shouting ] Fight me like a man. Fight me like a man. You put oil on the driveway. [ Dad Gurgling ] Oil on the driveway. Oil on the driveway. Oil... [ Whimpering, Sobbing ] [ Thinking ] My life really has become a horror movie. And you know how they end. [ Heavy Breathing ] You can't understand right now, But in the morning, you'll understand. I'm sorry. When you're older, you'll thank me for this. You'll see. Everything's going to be okay. - They can't hurt you anymore. - [ Crying ] You know, I would never do anything to hurt you. I'm your big brother. I let you borrow my movies. You deserve to know what happened. In the morning, I'll show you, okay? I'll show you everything. Please stop crying. Please. Please stop crying. Stop crying. [ Breathing Raggedly ] I didn't make you sad. I didn't make you cry. Stop crying! [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues, Faint ] [ Marty Thinking ] It's Monday morning. School will be starting soon. Will anyone notice I'm gone? Will they notice Dad's not at work? Or that Mom's not at the office? I wonder when they will come search the house. I try to move and it hurts all over. All I can do is wonder... Wonder when I'll be found. I look at Mom and I look at Dad, And they scream at me with their empty eyes. My mind wants to scream and kick and freak out, But I keep myself under control. If I lose it now, I might not come back for a long, long time. Stuff like this can really warp a person.
