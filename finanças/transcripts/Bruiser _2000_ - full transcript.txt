Radio host:...million of you guys out there. - Host: What's going on? - Man: Something I wanna do. - Host: What do you wanna do? - Man: I wanna kill myself. Well, that doesn't-- - Man: I have a gun. - Host: Have you loaded it? Host: I'm sorry-- I'm sorry. I just-- I just can't take these things seriously. A lot of you guys phone in, half the time you guys are cranks. Host: Hello? Host: Well it takes all kinds. We're gonna take another caller. - Host: You're on line two. - Man #2: I'm here. Host: Are you all right? Man #2: Like you give a shit whether I live or die! Host: I'm a regular guy, I know what it's like. Man #2: Regular guy, my ass! They don't pay me a million dollars to sit there and talk to people. Host: Well, they're not paying me for that either. They pay me to stir it up, to try and get some dialogue going. That's why I'm here, I just wanna get dialogue going with you. I don't want you to shoot yourself. Man #2: My old man drops dead, that's the point. Host: I'm sorry, I didn't know that. Man #2: He leaves me his house. 40 years he's been in this house, that's all he's got. Host: Yeah, well you lived-- Man #2: He leaves it to me, and what happens? Inheritance tax, land tax, school tax, you're-lucky-to-be-alive tax! - Man #2: I lost the place. - Host: You never-- Man #2: The bank sold it out from under me. Host: Oh man... Man #2: The guy spends his life working, paying what he owes, doing what he's supposed to do. Can't leave his house to his only kid... what kind of mark has he made? Host: Listen, chief, we can all go home and listen to our own ranting and ravings-- Man #2: You shovel sh--( beep ) all your life, and you don't even leave a mark? It's like... you shouldn't bother. It's like you've never been here at all! Host: No man, he left his mark. He left you. I don't think your old man's gonna appreciate you kicking off-- - ( gunshot ) - Host: Obviously-- Host: Hello? Hi... hello? We got a... we have a line? 66QRZ, we're taking a break. We'll be right back. Babe? Janine? God, you're so... ( dog barks ) ( gasp ) Christ! Is it morning already? - I'm sorry I woke you. - Shut the drapes. ( whispering ) Go back to sleep. I'll be home... regular time. No, we're supposed to go to the thing. - What thing? - Barbecue. Oh. Jesus, he's your boss, Henry. Did you shut the drapes? I still feel light on my face. The light. I got it. Bye. You know, it's incredible. Some guy just killed himself on the radio. It takes all kinds. Shit! Now I'm awake! Wide awake. ( dog barks ) ( barks ) This is people food, not mouse food. ( saw starting ) Janine: She learned how to do that. Oh, it's cute. Would you mind callin' her, please? Janine: All you have to do is unplug the stupid thing. ( saw stops ) Janine, do you mind calling her? Please. Henry: Janine? Man: ( chuckle ) Why walk when you can fly, baby? - Jimbo, what is that? - My new ride. Get in. I tell you, if I could fuck a car, I'd never leave my garage. - Jimbo: What do you think? - Oh, she's hot. She is hot! - Wanna see what she can do? - Guess I'm gonna. Oh yeah, you're gonna. Whoa... Come on baby, whoo. Jesus Christ, could you just slow down? d I've got everything I need... almost d - d But I don't got you... d - ( honk ) d You're the one I need the most. d Always wanted one of these babies. Cost me a bundle, but I tell you, some things are just worth it. Best money I ever spent. - Jimbo: So I dumped Consolidated. - Henry: Westerman? Uh... sold. You took a bite on it. Graves was up 1/8th, but remember you bought high... against my recommendation. You did all right on Stimper though. Cut to the chase. What am I getting? You already got it, it's in your account, - 1 2 and change. - 1 2? I already told you, the market's in the toilet. Even so, I figured... Ah, shit! That's just my luck. I expected to net-- Christ! You make it sound like I shortchanged you. No, no, it's not that. I just expected it to be more. I always expect it to be more. Look Jimbo, I'm house-poor. I don't even own the house yet. I'm stretching the work to afford it. You get the report at the end of the month. I should pay more attention. Janine looks after the finances. I told you this was a bad idea. Money and friends just don't mix. Stop it! Who better to trust than my oldest and best buddy, huh? Huh? Come on. Jimbo: 1 2:30, the club. Call what's-her-name my secretary. - Betty. - Right. Work it out with her. Excuse me. You-- Man: Hey! What the hell are you doing? Good mornin', Rita. Rita? Rita? Do you ever listen to the Larry Case show? No, but Frank told me. Some asshole blew his brains out. I tell you, it takes all kinds. Good morning. Did anyone hear the Larry-- - Did you watch Elsa last night? - The Deevers Collection? Oh, God. The last creative thing Rip ever did, was to get himself a breast implant. I have a friend who knows him, like really well. She says he wanted tits so he could see how his clothes would hang on a person with tits. Oh yeah. - Coffee? - Definitely. Woman: Hey, morning. Rosemary? What are you doing here? September cover. Milo asked me to pick out some new faces. - I like this one. - Yeah? - Which one's your candidate? - Milo's gonna go with that one. Henry: Number seven. My lucky number. - But you haven't even seen her. - I don't need to. - Your choice is my choice. - I didn't say she was-- Buon giorno, bruisers! Are you okay? Listen up, guys. All right... ( all clap ) - Milo: Bruisers! - All: Bruisers. Milo: All right! We've been paying close to $300,000 for a face... just because it's hot! Milo: That's insane, isn't it? Milo: I mean, we're hot, and we make heat. So, from now on... Rosie's got the cover. ( cheer and applause ) I'm not actually gonna be on the cover-- Oh, you ought to be, babe! You'd knock 'em dead! - ( gasp ) - ( laughs ) Man: You're the number one photographer. I asked Rosie, "Pick me faces from the street, that I can own, and that I can buy... for nothing." Milo: I have never seen any of these chickies before. But in a minute, I'll pick September's cover! It's instinct, you know? You've heard of that? Impulse? Those lima beans hanging between your legs, those are balls! Maybe you forgot what they look like? Huh! - Man: Hello? - ( laughs ) Milo: Now if you find nothing down there in-between your legs, stay home. But if you find a pair of maracas, get your ass over here and start shaking! Yeah, get fired. Show any kind of balls around here, you get a pink slip. Let's rock and roll. We've got 1 0 candidates, one to 1 0. So who do you pick? Who do you like? Come on. - Number seven. - Who said that? - Henry, sir. It's me. - Oh, Henry. So we've got one vote for number seven from Henry. - Come on, who else? - Number two. - Milo: Number two? - Man: Number three. - All right? - Woman: Number ten. - It's gotta be number ten. - Man: She's great. Oh for-- have you seen her teeth? Bad teeth. No way, no way. No way, no way. Come on, we've seen this face a hundred times before, haven't we? This is like yesterday's pizza. - Cold! - Woman: '80s. We've got number seven, we've got number nine. Who do you like now? I'm still going for number seven, sir. Oh, Henry, stickin' with number seven! I have to admire him. Because I admire him, I can be honest enough to tell him... your taste is in your ass. ( laughs ) Number seven is a fuckin' skunk! You want her? Keep her. Now this is what I call a bruiser! ( groan ) You're perfect. Now what the hell is she, Rosie? Milo: Chink or Jap? She's American. She was born here, Milo. Her father's from Korea, her mother's Puerto Rican. - Dominican. - She's a spick. Yes sir, she's half hispanic and part-- Milo: Nip? She's a spick-nip! - ( woman laughing ) - Or a pic-nic... I don't care! Can you imagine this face on a be-like-me cover, among all the white bread in the fucking supermarket? Milo: Whooo! Rosie, great job. And remember, bruisers, we make heat. Man: We make heat, yes! All: We make heat! We make heat! All: We make heat! Milo: Whoooo! We make heat! - Milo: And put a spin on it! - Spin on this. Here, here. Guess my lucky number's not so lucky. I thought he'd pick her for sure. She's his kind of cheap. You said she was your choice. I said I thought she'd be Milo's choice. I know you picked her because of me. You're very sweet. Other guys should take a lesson. - You know, Milo is-- - The boss! - And bosses are-- - Jerks. ( chuckle ) - I was gonna say entitled. - Milo's entitled himself. What happened to him? He was never like that before. No, I know. He was a communist. He was a fuckin' refugee, for Chrissake! Milo's been good to me. He's given me a lot of breaks. He's given me a career. I can't just forget that. I want you to know, I wanna tell you-- Milo: Creedlow! - You're one of-- - Milo: Henry, get your ass in here! Like I said, other guys should take a lesson. You're one of the only friends-- - the only true friends-- - Milo: Creedlow! I know. No, you don't know. You don't understand. What I'm trying to say is why you and I-- Henry? - Asshole wants you. - ( groan ) - Yes, sir? - What's the fuckin' matter with you? - A problem with your ears? - No, sir I was just-- We're talking about the party. Is everything cool? The barbecue is-- Why the fuck should I talk to you about my own barbecue? - I'm talking about the-- - The masquerade, sir. You're right, Henry. That's what we should be talking about, isn't it? - Yes, sir. - So, everything's copacetic? Sir? Come on, entertainment, food, the laser show, the freak show? - Everything's under control? - I think it's gonna be a blast, sir. - Are you coming? - I'm helping organize everything-- I'm talking about the fuckin' barbecue, Henry. Yes, sir. Yes, I'm coming. You know it's one of those bring-your-wife things? I'll bring my wife, sir. Good, Henry! I love it when it clicks up there. - Man: Mr. Styles, specifically-- - Milo: Come on. He's in a staff meeting. Can I take message? Who is it? - It's a Mr. Wynn. - Oh, put him through. He'll be right with you. - Good morning, Mr. Wynn. - Wynn: Good morning. I'm calling about your application. You were interested in platinum I believe, not gold? No, I already have a gold, but uh... my wife wasn't impressed, so I wanted to upgrade to a platinum. Wynn: Yes, well... a platinum card is like a blank check, Mr. Creedlow. It has no cash limit, as you know. Your credit history has been impeccable, but your assets... We found your estimates were a bit high. High? By 1 0, 1 5 grand? The market goes up as well as down. You know that. - Wynn: We know about the markets. - Your costume. But given your limited equity holdings, we're a good deal further off than 1 0 or 1 5,000. That much? Jesus, I must have miscalculated, but that much? So, my buddy is sitting at the bar and these two guys come in carrying a third guy and they just leave him there. The guy just flips off the stool, and lands flat on his ass. - Out! - This is the shaggy dog story? No, I swear it's true. So my buddy scoops him up, puts him back on his stool. The guy goes... bam! Flips right off the stool and lands flat on his ass, again. My buddy's looking at him thinking, "Oh, man he's shitfaced." He goes through his wallet, gets his license puts him in his car, drives him home, rings the doorbell, his wife comes to the door, he says, "Look, I got your husband." She says,"Thank you very much." He turns to go, and she turns to him and says, "Where's his wheelchair? " ( Larson laughs ) "Where's his fucking wheelchair? " Come on, Henry. Jesus Christ. Do us all a favor, go out with some of the money I make you, buy yourself a fucking sense of humor. Fuck! 40-30. I got one for you: A guy wakes up one morning and he's miserable. His life sucks. He's at the end of his rope. - So, he calls the-- - He calls the Larry Case Show, It's about that guy that blew his brains out, right? Christ, I can't tell that story to anyone. Power of the media. You should know. I'm not in the media. I'm in the face business. - Oh, just out. - No! Six inches, man. Game, set and match. - You guys are up. - Great. Thanks. What I want to know is, why would someone do that? So what if your life sucks? Whose doesn't? No one's, man. Except maybe mine. They turned me down on my platinum card. So what? Who needs it? Iced tea, please. - Henry, have something stiffer. - No, just an iced tea, thanks. They said it's my assets. That my assets have come up short. It makes you wonder. No shit it makes you wonder. You don't think there could be any tampering? - By who? - I don't know? Who's got access? It's not Janine. It's probably some computer glitch. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. In the meanwhile, Henry, do us all a favor and don't get worked up, okay? Like your friend on the radio, he gets himself all worked up. Over what? Nothing. I guarantee you, if I ever get cheesed enough to shoot somebody, the last person I'm gonna shoot is me. Man: Hey, how's it going? Hey, I just had to do that, man. You know? It's a fucking pool party! No hard feelings, eh? How are you doing, kiddo? Listen, thank you, Milo, This is-- this is the best. - Huh? - Yes. Great. Great party. Great house. It's a great house. Great house! She thinks I'm gonna give it up. Not a fucking inch of it, Rosie. I'd rather chop an inch off my dick. - You have a good lawyer, I hope? - The best. Me. - Are you okay? - Mmm. Have you filed yet? You don't file until you have a term sheet. All Rosie has to do is not move out. - She has to live with the creep? - Not with him, just near him. It doesn't look anything like him. - Sure it does. - Cheek-bones. - The nose. - The mouth, maybe the mouth. Amazing, isn't it? It's an exact replica, yet you'd never know who he was. He's a total blank. - Who's blank? - You are, cutie pie. - Come and take a look. - That's me? No. That's you. I don't know. I think it's cool. I can see myself. Yes, but can you make other people see you? - What do you mean? - Paint it. Color it-- whatever you think might make people recognize that it's you. They're great, but who are they? The only one I can recognize is Wilson. - How could you tell? - The beak. You ever do one of yourself? - Yeah. - How'd you decorate it? No, that's no fun. I know who I am. Oh. And Milo? It's enough she has to look at his real face. Gloria, most of the time-- I think we all know how Milo spends most of his time. - And with whom. - All you have to do is prove it. - That's you, isn't it? - Please. Stars and Stripes. Not until they elect a female president. You never told me you were a sculptress. I'm not. I never had the balls, as Milo would say, to do anything original. My little garden of lost souls. No matter how they're decorated, or what their make-up or what they're wearing, as soon as they're gone, they're gone. They fade from memory completely. - People are forgettable. - Most people. Not all people. Sorry, you have... a little plaster. We should stop hiding. People will wonder where we are. Yes, I should make an appearance. You go and see if you can work on your image. ( growls ) The new cover girl you picked this morning-- Oh, you like this doll, Ted? Tom. You're afraid I'm gonna pull her pants down, aren't you? Uh, no. I mean, yes. I like her a lot. But no, I never thought that you-- Sure you did. Come on. No. I'm not going to do it. Not tonight. Tomorrow night, she's fair game. A month from now, when she's been all over the newstands, she'll be everybody's date. Tonight's your only chance to prove to her that you're the man. Right. Yes. Well, thank you, Mr. Styles. I appreciate your advice. Fucker. You're a total sleaze. What the hell are you? Why do you have to fuck with people all the time? Because there's nothing else you can do with them. Look at them. Fucking pathetic crowd. I don't even know half of them. The only thing I need to know, is that they're busy. And what's keeping them busy is me, Milo Styles. You're a bastard. That you are. Everybody needs a bastard in their life. You see, it gives them... a yardstick to measure themselves by. Your yardstick is out there. Play with it. Come on, you're a grown-up. Play with it. Don't pop off, okay? I never met a guy who popped off as fast as you. Old guys lose their patience quickly. You're not old. Ooh, I caught a brass ring. Does it mean I get a free ride? Nothing's free, Milo. This is a pay as you go world. ( Milo moans ) Ma'am? Fill it with the best you've got. Switch seats. I'll drive. - I am not drunk. - Yes, you are, but that's not what I said. Say what you think. Give me a clue, please? Some reason why I should still be interested in a dick like you. Oh, no reason. Especially when there's so many more interesting dicks under the liquor bar. You noticed. Thank God, you're not brain-dead. - Cash or charge? - Charge. I try my best, I go out there every day, and I-- Let people walk all over you. Yeah, if that's what it takes, yes. - There are rules. - I know the rules better than you. Man: Sorry, no smoking near the pumps. Can I check the oil? The car's fine. Check his oil. No. Just gas, thanks. You hear about women who fuck their way to the top. Me... I have been fucking my way to the bottom. Six years and what do we have to show for it? A life? Jesus! When I first met you I thought you were on the fast track. Man, was I wrong. You swallow your emotions. You eat whatever shit is served up. - That's not fair. - You saw me jerking a guy off, for Chrissake! Did you slug him? No. Did you slug me? No. ( knocking on window ) - Yeah? - Your credit card, sir. I want to go someplace, Henry. You are going no place. You're nothing. Nobody. I'm not going in. Get out. Get out of the car. Treat me like shit. ...everything I've got. What more do you want? Suddenly I'm nothing. Fuck you! Aargh! Janine: Don't wait up. Did you hear me, asshole? I said, don't wait up. ( tires screech ) Radio host: We're taking calls from everybody around the city. And we're gonna take one from John on line two. - John: Larry? - Larry: Yeah. Hi, go ahead. John: I'd like to talk about the guy that shot himself. Larry: Yes, what about Mr. Stupid? John: I don't think he's stupid. I mean-- Larry: Well, I don't know. John: He made his point. He made an impression. Larry: The only thing he made an impression was on his skull. John: That's a good one. He made headlines in every newspaper. Larry: He did it on my show, and that's what everybody remembers. John: To get attention. For the first time in his life, he's been noticed. Larry: What's good about being dead and noticed? I mean, dead ain't sexy. At six feet under, you think anyone's gonna notice him in his grave? - John: He's not in a grave. - Larry: What do you mean? John: He's sitting in a rocking chair, sipping a cold one, talking to some pimp on the radio. I'm him, asshole. I'm the guy. Just this regular guy, my own man and everything, and I'm risen from the dead. And this time around, I'm not taking any-- ( beep ) from rat bastards like you. You treat us like garbage. Like we're nothing. Like we're not even here. You can't turn a man into nothing. You try, you're the one that's gonna pay. You're the-- ( click ) Henry: This isn't happening. This is just a dream. Woman: Hello. Señora, the garage is open. Is anybody home? Janine's not here, but I am. You left the garage open. The door open. This is bad city, señor. You leave house open it's trouble. ( woman speaks Spanish ) I'm sorry, what was that? ( speaks Spanish ) ( speaks Spanish ) What did you find, Katie? What did you find in my pocket? Find, señor? Nothing. I was fixing your jacket, and fold it out, make it nice. - ( Katie speaks Spanish ) - You stole money, didn't you? Money? No, never. No? How about silver? I steal nothing. ( speaks Spanish ) ( Henry speaks Spanish ) You speak Spanish, señor? Oh, yeah. I'm full of surprises. You must have a lovely home, Katie, with all the things you've stolen. I steal nothing. I take nothing. ( silver clanks ) If you take nothing, then there's nothing in this bag. Take that! Henry: It's just that she made me so angry. It's real. It's all real. ( tires screech ) Janine: Henry? The dog is out. That's a good dog. Henry, are you home? Henry? The dog was out. Go on now. Henry... ( saw buzzes ) ( yelps ) Pupsie, come here. I know it's a bad old thing, bad old saw. I told your daddy to unplug it. He doesn't even know what to do with an extension cord. Yeah. Hi, it's me. No, he's not here. - ( Pupsie barks ) - Pupsie, stop that. I turned it off. Come here. Come here, baby. That's it. Huh? He's not here. If he was, you think I'd tell him I'm going away with you? When you're ready to get serious, then I'll talk to him. Until then, I've got to make a living, too. ( laughs ) Oh, yeah, like you give a shit. So where are you taking me? Really? How'd you work that out? Hold on a minute. Okay. Come here. Come on. Come on. A weekend in the sun. I'll take it. Even if you are just fucking with me. Hey, Pupsie. Come on, Pupsie. Look at this. Look at this. Come on. Yeah, good. Come on. ( car engine starts ) - Janine: Milo. - Milo: I'm hiding. Milo: Getting warmer. Getting warmer. Ooh, you're getting hotter. Ow! Hey, got to keep up your energy, honey. Some English muffin? Sable on a bagel? I told you, I'm not hungry. Something more substantial? ( latin music playing ) Are we leaving or what? This is not my idea of a good time, standing around watching you eat sable on a bagel. Adios. What about some jelly on the belly? Oh, God. Is your dick on steroids? We spent all last night in bed. And we're gonna spend the whole weekend in bed. Bed... is a blessing given to us by the gods. Come on. But how often do you get to make it on a $40,000 fucking conference table, honey? Yeah, wait. Milo: I'm gonna come. Oh God, it's so beautiful. ( Janine laughs ) That's good. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. - Oh, yes! - ( mechanical door rumbles ) Wait! Wait! Gotcha, dickhead! Milo! Hey, Rosie. Come on, you're spying on me? That's beneath you, honey. Just trying to keep track of who's beneath you, Milo. You wanna ruin me? Is that what you want? I just want what's fair. - What? - What's fair, Milo! Shit! ( rattling ) - ( clanging ) - Milo. ( crashing ) Milo, is that you? ( screams ) What's the matter? You shocked by my appearance? - Henry? - Well, let me tell you, I'm shocked by yours. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me! You're crazy, Henry. You've gone fucking crazy. Not crazy. No, gone. All gone. You took the only thing that can't be replaced. My identity. There's nothing left. Nothing! Where am I? Huh? Come on, come out. Where am I? Hello. ( screams ) God, is that blood? Yeah, and you know what? I'm getting a taste for it. Ow! Now, I may be a loser, but I know exactly what to do with an extension cord. ( Janine screams ) You can't do this to me, Rosie. Rosie, that was a fucking private moment, you understand? Don't you have any ethics? We're partners-- ( glass shatters ) Boo. Don't-- don't hurt me. Please, Henry. You know me? I heard you talking. You and Janine. Well, that puts you at an unfair advantage, doesn't it? You know who I am. So, we'll have to pull back the curtain so I can know who you are. Please, just let me go. Pull back the curtain. Jesus, Henry. What's happened to you? What are you doing here? Nothing. I came to catch up on some work, that's all. Come out here, Tom. Please, Henry. You're not going to-- Just come out here, Tom. I can't fucking check her pulse, she's hanging 20 feet up with a fucking cord around her neck. There's no panic, the cops are on the way. There she is, sir. I don't know what the hell-- What the fuck is-- Sir, she came out from there, the fourth floor. Out of fool's mouths. - What do you mean? - Janine was right. I've been eating whatever shit was served up. Don't develop a taste for it, Tom. You'll wind up looking like me. They saw what happened. Ghandi knows everything that happened. He saw everything. And the guy with the saxophone, he's fucking blind. Just relax, all right? Just take it easy. - I'm going to check it out. - We need an ambulance. I don't know what's happened to me, Tom. And I'm not sure I know exactly what to do. You and I have got to come to an arrangement. Tom: Of course. Whatever I-- Anything you-- You don't tell anyone that you saw me. I won't. You tell anyone... anyone that I was here today, and I'll have to take unpleasant measures, you understand? Yes. I swear, Henry. I'll never-- Don't disappoint me. I've been disappointed enough. You have my word, Henry. You have my word. Mr. Styles? - Yeah, who's asking? - Detective McCleary, Homicide. You want to tell us what happened? Can't you see what the fuck happened? Aside from the obvious. Why are you looking at me? I didn't do anything. I was down here on the street, and she jumped. The uniformed officers on the scene don't think she jumped. What? They think it was a murder. Well, you should ask them. They saw everything. They can tell you what happened. Why don't you go and talk to them? I'd rather talk to you. There's some shit here, kimosabe. - These things record, right? - Yeah, sometimes they run a tape. Hey, boss! Check this out! Oh, that was good. See if you can mess up the crime scene some more. Fuckin' chadrool. I'm embarrassed to ask this, sir, but... did you recognize either one of those garments? Oh, what do you think, Columbo? I'm fucking standing here in my underwear in the middle of the street and one of your chadrools is waving an empty pair of pants out my window. We were having an affair, me and that girl. It doesn't mean I threw her out the window, you understand? Was there anybody else around up there? Yeah, of course. I always invite an audience when I fuck. Cheerleaders, crackerjacks... my wife-- ex-wife. She was here? What? As a member of the audience? Yeah, very funny. She's working for me. She's working for the magazine. She's a photographer. You saw her leave? The building? You mean she was still in the building? You mean she was hiding? Oh, come on. No fucking way! No way. My Rosie, she's an angel. You don't understand. She's-- No. No, it's impossible. That's a fucking horrible thing to say, sir. ( Pupsie barks ) ( car approaching ) ( doorbell rings ) - Man #1 : Call him again. - Man #2: I've been calling him. Then you know the number. Call him again. ( phone rings ) ( Henry and Janine's voices ) You've reached the Creedlow residence. Leave a message for either Henry or Janine, Henry: and we'll get back to you. Janine: Maybe. ( giggles ) Henry: We've got to go. Janine: Come on, we are going. ( Henry and Janine laugh ) ( machine beeps ) Yeah, this is Detective Rakowski again. It's about your wife, Mr. Creedlow. We've got to talk to you. ( machine beeps ) Man #2: Still no answer, man. I'm telling you the guy's not there. - You think we should go in? - No. No. It's too soon. Maybe he's lying in there. Maybe something happened to him. Man #1 : Yeah, maybe. Man #2: If we make our move, we should go in. Man #1 : We have no real cause. If we pop the door, they're gonna have our asses. Man #2: No, no. Come on, maybe he skipped. Man #1 : Why would he skip? Man #2: Wild guess. Maybe because he killed his wife. Man #1 : No, no, no. He didn't do it. The other dame did it. Yeah? You mean Styles' ex? What ex? They're not divorced. She had motive, she had opportunity. Styles admitted she was there. Nah, this dame was not waxed by another dame. You know how much strength it takes to pitch somebody through a closed window? That's why the chair. To break the glass. This could be the guy. What about this other guy, Burtram? I'll bet you 1 00 the dame did it. - I'll raise you 50. - You are on. You go dig up this Burtram character. I'll go visit Styles and his ex. You're not gonna just let this guy go, are you? The husband? No, no, we're not just gonna let this guy go. You call in for a warrant. And the dame did it. No, no. The dame did not do it. ( beeps ) Man's voice: Henry, I just saw something on the news, and... it's Jimmy, around 3:00. Listen, the only thing you can do wrong right now is freak out. If Janine is-- I can't even say it. If it's true, there's ownership, there's joint holdings, there's all kinds of legal shit. Before you do anything, call me. ( machine beeps ) Henry. Shit, it's 3:30. It's Jimmy here, I'm dying. Call me, okay? Call me. I thought there'd be more. I always think-- that there ought to be more. ( Pupsie barks ) You have been the most annoying thing in my life. Reporter: Locally, police report no suspects in this morning's murder of a woman on Newmarket Street. Traffic was snarled for several hours as police closed off the scene, causing a surge of complaints from the area's tony business owners. The victim, whose name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin, apparently strangled to death when she dropped out of a fourth story office window suspended on a length of cord. The city's bravest joined the city's finest outside the building... Henry: Yes, is this the San Juan Agency? One of your domestics was supposed to be with us this morning. Saldano? I think her first name was-- is Katie. Well, she didn't show up. And I'll let you know if I hear anything. What are you saying? Yeah. Umm-hmm. ( doorbell rings ) No. Hold on. Inga! Stay on the line. Can you get the fucking door? ( doorbell rings ) Inga! Where is she? Inga! ( phone rings ) ( phone rings ) Rosie: Whoever it is, I'm not here. ( doorbell rings ) Milo: You're all wet, so you'll get the phone, and I'll get the door. Maybe I'll get wet, get the phone, and you get the door. Okay, I'll get the door. Just answer the fucking phone, will you? - Leave me alone. - Rosemary, don't go to the door. - What? - Don't go to the door. - Milo went to the door. - Shit! It's the police. - Who is this? Henry? - They think you did it. - Did what? - Be careful. Whatever you say. - This is crazy. How did you-- - Don't come out here. Come out where? - Henry, where are you? - Outside. You're outside my house? You know how it is, right? You look like a guy who's been around the block a few times. With your job, you must have been out there salami-ing around on the side, huh? No. Of course, if I had cutie pies hanging all over me the way you do-- What are you talking about? I never touch the chickies. Word gets out, I'm fried. The magazine's fried. The whole shebang goes Kentucky. I never touch the chickies. If I wanna go salami-ing around, I look for a grown-up. I think you understand what I mean? Yeah, well... I understand what you mean, "grown-up"... - Yeah. -...Iike somebody else's wife. Fuck you, Pope Pius. Like you never stuck your dick up another man's sandwich? Come on, give me a break. We're two guys talking here. Rosemary, there are only two people who had a reason to kill Janine. You and me. - Henry, it wasn't me. - Listen to me. Henry, I swear, I didn't do it. Listen to what I'm trying to say, one of us did it. - No... - It wasn't you. - It had to be someone else. - Milo: We got the cops here. Henry: I did it. It was me. Sorry to bother you, ma'am. I know this has been tough. Hey, Rosie's tough, right babe? One tough piece of flesh. - What do you want me to say? - What do you mean, "what"? I've got nothing to hide. I've told them everything already. You caught us in the office, took some pictures, remember? All that means is that I was there. You were there. I also told him, didn't I, sir? I told you specifically, I told him there's no fucking way Rosie had anything to do with this. No, I left. I told him you fucking left. Come on, Rosie. Would you shut the fuck up? You don't fucking talk to me like that. Styles! The lady just asked you to shut the fuck up! Excuse me. I'm sorry, ma'am. Is there anything you might like to say without his interference? Rosemary: No. No. - McCleary: These masks... - They're weird, eh? - The little lady's hobby. - Can we go inside, please? Officer, you want to step inside, and watch some of her other talents? I'll bet you they're more interesting than these boring masks. You never know what might figure in. What tape? What tape are you talking about? Excuse me. You guys know anything about a tape? Oh. The security camera down at Bruiser. Some asshole leaked it to the press. It's got to be a mask, right? I mean, obviously. - Yeah. - It's Creedlow. The husband. Uhn-uh. Come on. Anyway, it's a guy, right? Give me that. Obviously, it's a guy. What's so obvious about it? That could be a dame. That Newley dame, she makes them. - Makes what? - Masks. She's got a million of them. Yeah, and maybe she killed Creedlow, too. Something else I don't know about? Well, we executed the warrant on the house. The place is a mess. Blood on the floor, his I.D. stuck to it. Nine mil slugs in the walls. And a shirt with a buttonhole where there ain't supposed to be one. - What's the word on the blood? - We're still typing it. So, Fadush, who's your friend? She's our only witness. You interrogate her, huh? You have the right to an attorney, if you cannot afford an attorney, Fadush will finance your attorney. Reporter:...alarmed by the recent trend and views it as greatly exaggerated in the local media. The suspect remains at large, leading to increased speculation about the identity of the mysterious assailant. Police continue to refuse to comment about the motive for the brutal slaying, saying only that detectives view it as an isolated incident. ( reporters ask questions ) I don't know what you're talking about... The murder, the 56th in the city this year, has caused renewed attacks on the administration's crime policy, which has resulted in an increase in per capita violent incidents, up 57% from the same period last year... All right... that's very cute. Who's there? Nobody that matters. Jesus, come on. Henry? Are you fucking with me here? Henry: No no no. You finish off, I just wanted to talk about my portfolio. You know the 1 2 and change that I thought oughta be more? Okay, it's better. Better that it's on the table. Better that you finally found out. Found out? What could I have possibly found out? Uh... Oh, you mean the money. The money that you stole from me. How long have we known each other, Jimbo? A long time, Henry. A long, long time. And do you think it's right to steal from people that you've known for a long, long time? That shiny new car of yours? I bought it for you, didn't I? Guys! Anybody? Walter? Paul? Anybody? ( door closes ) Walter? Is anybody... is anybody in here? Henry? Jesus! Arrgh! God! I think I broke something. Something's broken. Thanks. You signed this, didn't you? Right where it says authorizing agent? What are you, nuts? Are you fucking crazy? Arrgh! Okay, okay! Fuck, Henry! Fuck... I did it, all right. It was 30 some grand over two years. That's it. That's all I took. It was Janine's idea. She took all the rest. I swear to God I'll give you-- I'll give you every penny back, Henry. My briefcase... my briefcase, it's in my locker. I'll write you a check right now. Looks like you pissed yourself, there, buddy. Must be the stress-- the stress of high finance. You fucking prick. You're actually enjoying this, aren't you? Henry, your face... - you look-- - Different? I am, Jimbo. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Argh! God! Why did you do it? I fucked up, Henry. I fucked up and I'm sorry. Now I'm going to write you a check, and I'm going to make us square. I'm going to make us even. No no no! Not nearly even! Not nearly square! Damn it, Henry, you were never supposed to notice! Notice? You thought because you didn't notice me, that I wouldn't notice you? Really? Yes! So if you're going to go fucking shoot somebody, shoot yourself, Henry. Not me! No, I'm gonna to take your advice, Jimbo. The only bit of decent investment advice you ever gave me-- if I ever get cheesed enough to shoot someone, the last person I'm gonna shoot is me. Shit... You fucking lunatic. Some things are worth it. Best money I ever spent. The man had gone to market To buy a diamond ring The man who never noticed That he was not a king He choose the brightest sparkle A diamond made of glass The setting bright and gold Was crafted out of brass The man spent all his money The jeweler was a cheat He told the man that royals Wore diamonds on their feet The man went proudly walking Inside his shoe, the ring And no one ever told him That he was not a king. So you saw the guy, but you can't describe him. You want me to write that down? Am I a suspect here? Fine, if I'm a suspect, I'd like to consult a lawyer before I answer any more-- Did the I hear the "L" word? Relax, Mr. Burtram. Have yourself a cup of joe. I brought extra. This Nazi shows up at my house. I didn't have to come down here with him, did I? No, sir, you did not. So why did you? Just wait here, we'll get you a lift home. - All right. - You guys, drive this guy home? - Okay. - It's this car over here. Thanks. He'll tell you where to go. You're still not hard. Sorry. ( garage door opens ) Girl: What was that? Nothing. It's okay. Come on, let's try again. I'm ready. I guess... I'm not. Girl: You used to say I got you going more than anyone ever got you going. Burtram: You do. And I had hopes for us, babe, I really did. But I have to get out. What do you mean? Out of the tub? Out of town. Out of the rat race. Just... out. Are you wanted or something? Are you on the lam? The woman who died? The police think I might have killed her. I didn't. But I know who did. Jesus, who? Another guy. Another... ordinary guy. You sold him out to the cops, right? No, I told them I had no idea who he was. Not far from the truth-- I barely know him. But in the end, he might turn out to be the best friend I ever had. Come on, you expect me to pack up and run away with you when I'm gonna be on the cover of Bruiser? I didn't ask you to come with me. I got the cover, Tommy! I didn't ask you to come with me. You expect me to leave town when I got the cover? Hey! Creep! You want a free peek? Here it is, baby! Tomorrow it'll cost you more than you could ever afford! Larry: 66WQRZ. The 66th caller wins a T-shirt with a picture of nobody on it. Caller, who do you think Faceless is? Man: My brother. He has a problem with authority. Larry: So spank him. Next. Woman: I think it's you, Larry. - That's very funny. - No one ever sees your face. You're just a voice on the radio, anomalous! Larry: Anon-- anonamis-- anonymous, you idiot. Which is one thing I'm not! - This is Frank Himmelfarb. - Who the hell is Frank Himmelfarb? My point exactly. Larry: Why don't you kill yourself? This is WKILL. Phone in and kill yourself. Himmelfarb! Frankenfarben. We're gonna take a break. We'll be right back. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. That's a lie-- actually, I did. - What are you doing here, Henry? - I'm going away. But first I have accounts to settle. - Milo! - He's not here. I saw him drive away about an hour ago. An hour? So the accounts you have to settle are with me. I didn't want to wake you, so I used the time to finish this. That's not a cast I made. Nope, it's all me. I've been working on my image. For the world's greatest wuss, I'm becoming a pretty good second-story guy. I got in the back window. I had to. There's a police car outside. I can't let you go out there. Henry, I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry about what happened. You sound guilty. What have you got to feel guilty about? Because I was part of it. I knew. You knew? About Milo and Janine? How long? Not long, just... Henry, please, you're scaring me. We get so used to the lies and deceit. It makes you do things that you don't want to do. - I tried to tell you. - I know. When you said that it was only the two of us that could have done it, I was so sure you thought it was me, - I couldn't imagine... - Imagine that it was me? That it was Henry? Henry what's-his-name? That mouse? That mouse-dog crawling around in an unfinished house? Trying to make it look like this? Who would want to live like this, except a glutton like Milo? Why don't you just kick it over? Get out? Get away from him and all his fucking garbage! I am trying. It's not that simple. In your head, it's not. But out here, where your feet touch the ground, it is. As simple as murder? What's in your head, Henry? Shhh. It's okay. I can understand what you did. I can't forgive it, and I can't forget it. But I can understand it. I know what it's like to feel so betrayed. What you don't understand is that if you let them betray you, you're betraying yourself. I've done it my whole life. And it's what you'll be doing if you stay with that creep. What else do I have? Look at me. I'll hold. - What do you see? - A beautiful woman. Someone of value. Someone I value. No, I'm still here. We should have spoken. We did. You weren't listening. At the office. You said you owed Milo a debt. You were saying, that if it weren't for that debt, maybe you and-- Is that the Larry Case Show? Am I on air? I'm phoning about Faceless. I know who he is. Me, Henry Creedlow. I murdered my wife. - For God's sake. - And another woman. Katie Saldano. That wasn't murder... well, not premeditated. But I killed her anyway. I dropped her body off the 9th Street pier. Henry, stop it! And my good friend, Jimbo Larson. He's in the river, same place. He'll be the one in the fancy new car. The police are also talking to a guy named Burtram. He had nothing to do with any of this. He's a good guy. And there's another good guy. Rosie. Rosemary Newley. She had nothing to do with any of this, either. And she won't have anything to do with whatever happens later tonight. I'm cutting you loose, Rosie. ( people laughing ) Man: Where the hell are we going? Woman: I don't know. That's half the fun. Woman: Milo's idea of a good time. Pack us in a cattle car and take us down to the ghetto. Come on down! Man: This is the pits. Actually, we haven't gotten to the pits just yet. Oh, I believe I found your switch. Mind if I turn you on? Miss Jones, you're beautiful without your glasses. I wanted contacts, but they didn't have my size. Man: All right, let's make this quick. Y'all got some good shit. Toss it up. - I don't have anything. - Let's see what this is about. You're right. You ain't got shit. Not no more. Arrgh! Help me. Hey! Let's party! Why don't we grab a cab and go home? May I have your name, sir? Mr. Styles likes the names of those who do not choose to attend. Man: I think we could, maybe, for a few minutes. All right. You guys stay close to me. Buddy, can you spare some change? It's Henry. Henry, I hired you, Creedlow. Going okay? So far, so good. Three trucks unloaded, nobody spotted us as fakes. Good. I'm the new cover girl. Are you somebody I should know? I don't think so. I voted for number seven. Want to see how fucking crazy I am? We're the wrong dudes. Jester: Different strokes for different folks. Different rooms for different dooms. Feel the coldness. Feel the coldness of dead flesh. Feel the coldness. ( rock music plays ) d The silence where you hide d d Till you scream d d Till you scream... d Football player: Touchdown! Dancer: Extra point. I didn't think it was gonna be this nuts. Call the cannery. Six cars, signals off. If Creedlow is here, I don't wanna scare him away with sirens and shit. Two-ninety in a jar. Strip district, Canal Street. Number 1 2, requesting backup. What the fuck is wrong with you people? What the fuck is wrong with you people? Milo: She's a bruiser! Who designed your costume? Mommy and Daddy. I'm fuckin' freezing, though. This is an interesting touch. What do you mean, it's fucking real. That fucking thing is real. I love it. It's going to be a whole new thing. It's hotter than silicone, dames with mustaches. Whooo, I'm gonna change September's cover. No! You can't change your mind. I told everybody I got the cover! Get out of here, you freak! - Milo? How's it hanging? - What the heck was that? What are you doing here? Keeping an eye on things. - Chester? - Yeah? Henry Creedlow. We spoke on the phone. Oh, yeah. How ya' doin', man? So what is all this shit? Mixers, we got sequencers, with manual over-rides. Of course, of course, manual override. We've got the nub unit over there. That picks up the signals so we can do the music. It's gonna be amazing, you've gotta see this, Iike it's confetti flying and, shit, it's gonna be great. And that thing, that's a little freaky, though, because I've never really done a show before where I had to, honest to God, deal with a blaster like that. - Cool. - No. Hot. Don't touch it. This fucker is twice as hot as the fuckin' sun. Really? We'd better be careful then. Very careful. Bruiser. Fuckin' bruiser, man. ( grunting ) ( snake rattling ) I think you should get out of here. Henry could walk right by and you'd never recognize him. He's painted his face. Only I've seen it. Everybody here is faceless. We don't know what his real face looks like. We're wasting our time looking for Creedlow. We gotta find Styles. Stick with him so nobody jumps his ass. Die! Die! Die! Girl: Hey, where are we going? Man: All right, take him up. Next victim. McCleary: Shit! This way. Come on! Son of a bitch! Don't shoot! You might wax the dame. We gotta go up. No, listen, he's gotta come down. - Where's the goddamn backup? - I don't know. You cover down here, I'm going up. Damn! You called them. You called the police. No I didn't. They followed me here. They won't stop me. You won't stop me. Not until I've finalized your divorce. There are other ways to do this. To do what? You still live with the bastard. He probably still gets to fuck you in the shower whenever he's got the leftover energy. Am I wrong? Yes you are! Don't do this. They know who you are. The whole world knows who you are! You told them! I told them because I didn't want them thinking it was you. I would have gotten away with it! Gotten away with what? You didn't do anything. You don't get it! You said you were gonna leave. Go now while you still have the chance. I've lost you anyway. Whatever we had is finished. Whatever we had? When you told me you killed all those people, I knew there was no chance of having you as a-- As a what? Friend? Soulmate? Someone to hold your hand, tell you it's gonna be all right? You want a companion, get a fucking dog, as long as it's not a poodle. This is where we get off. Don't worry, it's safe. Henry, please, I'm begging you. Really? Nobody ever begged me before. It feels kind of good to be begged. We could leave together, go now... You're only saying that to save Milo's ass. Take advantage, Rosemary. Do what everyone else does, and take advantage. Henry, wait! They'll catch you if you go! Rosie, they won't know me. I'm invisible-- I've always been invisible. ( elevator doors open ) ( bat screeching ) Rakowski? Rakowski? I'm right here. I think I got him, third floor. Stop! Stop or I'll-- ( gunshots ) Henry: Jesus, I could have hit you if I'd wanted to. You son of a bitch. d All I give is hate it seems to them d d I thought they could make things evil... d Girl: Get lost! I don't get paid enough for this. Any of you guys seen Styles? Check the John Does over there. Come with me. I wanna give him a taste of his own medicine. Okay. ( girl screaming with pleasure ) What the fuck! Are you trying to scare somebody? No. I'm just waiting my turn. You're my kind of guy, aren't you? That's why I always tell them, "Bring me a handicapper." Because nobody uses it, it's nice, it's clean, it's tidy, and there's plenty of room to salami around. Know what I mean? You mean you had a woman in there? Hello? What do you think? That I had a shit of a lifetime? I have to tell you, Milo, that in my opinion, you're just about the lowest thing that ever crawled. We all mean nothing to you. That's right, you mean nothing to me. You know why? Because you are fucking nothing. An ant-- a fucking ant, with no mind and small balls. That's what you all are, and I'm a fucking anteater-- - Fuck! - Milo, relax, it's all part of the show. Part of the show? All right! We're fucking with you. We're just fucking with you, - like you fuck with us. - I like that. We've got something planned for you, sir. A grand finale? Yeah, I mean how could we have a grand finale without you, sir? - Exactly. Come on! - Take him away. Milo: The grand finale, that's great! Woman: Milo? Milo? He's gone. Party's over. And if you know what's good for you, you'll find yourself a shirt and get out of here. Go on! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Yeah! ( trumpet blares ) Got it, hit it-- What the fuck was that? Cool. Man: Armageddon, ladies and gents. Armageddon! I can fly! I can fly! I can fly! I can fly! Where the hell is Tinkerbell? Bam! So what's happening next? This is fucking hilarious! I love you, Romans and countrymen! Woman: I love you! I love you, too! Thank you everyone, everybody! Aghhh! God, get me down! Woman: Yeah, Milo! This is really happening! You hear? This is happening! What are you doing? - Woman: Dance, Milo, dance! - Come on, you want to play? You little fucking hack! You're nothing but a hack. We... make... heat. ( crowd cheers ) Henry? I didn't realize you were here. Henry: You can see my face? Yeah, Henry, I can see your face. My face is back? Did it go somewhere? Yeah... but I stood up. I stood up for myself! Henry, you are a whacko. But you are such a cute whacko. Come here and dance with me. Come on, come on. Freeze! ( gunshot ) Masked person: It's nothing, see? The mask. My mask. It's a total blank. Just like yours used to be. I can't hear you! McCleary: Freeze! Wait a minute, over here. I'm the killer. This isn't right! It's me you want. No, it's me. You thought it was me all along. It's me! It's me! - It's me! - No, it's me! - It's me! - Me! Man: This man's dead! Dancer: That's it, I quit. No, doll, you're fired. - Are you all right, miss? - Yeah, yeah. Sorry to hear about it. Rakowski: I need everybody, listen man, all the way downtown, we're gonna flood the fucking warehouse district. We got a brown Volvo leaving. A Volvo! He's gone. No, he's somewhere. Somewhere, and I'm going to find him. It's my job to find him. Why'd you do it? Do what? Lady, I've been skunked here tonight, and I've gotta answer for it. So help me out-- why'd you do it? I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Hey. If you change your mind-- if you catch up to him before I do, gimme a call. Okay. Paula Fleet. That's you. What are we gonna do about the Steelers, man? Here we go. Here you are, sir. Apple a day keeps the doctor away. Man: Because it's crap, that's why I don't like it! Your taste is up your ass, folks. What is it with you? Does nobody have a fucking brain? I take it back. You don't need a brain. What you need is some fucking cojones, folks! Some lima beans, for God's sake! What the fuck are you staring at? Me, sir? "Me, sir? " Yes you, dickhead. Something here interest you? Not particularly. Then what the fuck are you staring at? Nothing, sir. Nothing.
