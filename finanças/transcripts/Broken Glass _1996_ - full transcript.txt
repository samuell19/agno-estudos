[soft dramatic music] -[soft dramatic music] -[crowd yelling] -[soft dramatic music] -[woman gasping] -[soft dramatic music] -[crowd yelling] [glass shattering] [soft dramatic music] -[kid laughing] -[soft dramatic music] Hey. [soft dramatic music] Sylvia, give me three minutes. Two minutes. [Sylvia] How was Jersey? Same as ever. Jersey's Jersey. Is your sister coming? And David. I think he'd prefer the Cagney, don't you? Didn't we see the Cagney? Phillip, that was his last one. [phone ringing] [soft dramatic music] It's Kevin Sullivan. [soft dramatic music] Hurry, they'll be here in a couple of minutes. And remember to congratulate David on his scholarship. Kevin. Flora, why don't you take the rest of the evening off? Thank you, Mrs. Gellburg. Oh, did your brother have any luck getting that warehouse job? I had to wake him at three in the morning. And when he got there, there were more than 40 men in line. [soft dramatic music] Yeah, you've been very helpful. [soft dramatic music] David, I refuse to discuss such nonsense. Auntie Sylvia didn't go to college, Ma. Uncle Phillip didn't and look at them. There weren't 12 million unemployed then. Joel Lieberman has a college degree and he's selling ties in Macy's. David, we are gonna have a nice family evening out at the movie. So enough. [phone clicking] Myra, don't you ever go home? Yeah, listen, a couple of years ago, we used a local plumber on a building over from Wanamaker's in Manhattan. Yeah, Irishman. Has a mortgage with us. No trouble, Mr. Gellburg. Give me a few seconds. Is this something to do with 611? It's Mr. Gellburg. Your annex idea, Stanton? At the right price, Bill. Gellburg is sleuthing for me. I've had a preliminary sketch done. Take a look at it in the car if you like. I'd value your opinion. Enjoy the opera, Mr. Case, Mr. Vandalheart. It was ABC plumbing, Mr. Gellburg. Owner is J. O'Leary. [soft dramatic music] General Gellburg. [woman gasping] What happened? Sylvia. [David] Auntie Sylvia. I can't. I seemed to. I can't. What happened? She can't move. She fell and she can't move. Can't move, come on. I can't move my legs. [Phillip] Sure you can, Sylvia. No, Phillip, I can't. David, would you go for the doctor, please? Course. Doctor? Sylvia. Dr. Hyman on Fifth Street. He was very good with Papa. You remember? She'll be okay, come on. Just past the trolley stop. I'm sorry about the movie, dear. Go for God's sake. I'm sorry. So sorry. [Phillip] I can't believe this is happening. [dramatic music] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [dramatic music] Dr. Hyman. [soft dramatic music] Dr. Hyman. [soft dramatic music] Dr. Hyman, your wife said you'd be here. What's happened? Mrs. Gellburg, she's collapsed. She can't move. Jerry. Can you finish rubbing her down a little please? Sorry, kid, emergency. [soft dramatic music] I'm so sorry. [soft dramatic music] [saw whirring] Mr. O'Leary around? [saw whirring] I'll wait. [saw whirring] Mrs. Gellburg, it's me, Dr. Hyman. [Sylvia] Come in, Doctor. How did you sleep? Better than usual. Isn't that strange? That's a lot of work. And as soon as old Mr. Wanamaker gets back from his cruise, guaranteed he'll give us the go ahead in those boilers. Not that we don't have other work. I was just in the neighbourhood, Mr. O'Leary. Listen, we're talking about your mortgage near the renewal time. [saw whirring] I can't say it's obvious to me how to proceed, Hyman. This case is, well, it's more than unusual. [clock ticking] Can I get you something? Tea? He said one o'clock sharp. That new unions pulled a strike. Imagine a strike in a hospital. It's incredible. You're Mrs. Hyman? Yes. We met at Mount Sinai while he was interning. It's nice to meet you finally, Mr. Goldberg. Gellburg, not Goldberg. Oh, I'm sorry. G-E-L-L-B-U-R-G. It's the only one in the phone book. Does sound like Goldberg. But it's not. It's Gellburg. You all right? 'Cause you seem a little pale. I'm always this colour. [soft dramatic music] Oh. [women laughing] [soft dramatic music] Thanks, Flora. Well, Harry, will get to the bottom of it if anyone can. They call them from everywhere for opinions. You know, Boston, Chicago. He oughta be on Park Avenue, but he always wanted a neighbourhood practise. Why? I don't know, but you can't fight a person's nature. Like me, for instance, I like to talk and I like to laugh. You're not much of a talker, are you? When I can get a word in edgewise. [laughs] So you've got a sense of humour after all. Well give my best to Mrs. Goldberg. Gellburg. Gellburg, excuse me. It practically sounds like Goldberg. No, no. Look in the phone book. It's the only one. G-E-L-L. She chew your ear off? I've had worse. Well, women are talkers. But try living without them, right? [Phillip] Without women? Oh well, nevermind. I'm glad you could make it. -Smoke? -No, thanks. Isn't it bad for you? Yeah. Certainly is. But more people die of rat bite, you know? Rat bite? Well yes, but they're mostly the poor, so it's not an interesting statistic. Dr. Sherman's report. [Phillip] What does he say? I'm getting to it. [Phillip] Oh, beg your pardon. You'll have to bear with me. Wanna play, Phillip? [Phillip] Certainly. I'm gonna express myself very quickly, Phillip. Likewise, go ahead. Take your time. People tend to overestimate the wisdom of physicians. So I try to think things through before I speak to a patient. I'm glad to hear that. [soft piano music] God, Sylvia. [soft piano music] You all right, Flora? I'm fine. Next time, Flora. Can you wait to do this 'til you know I'm dropping by? So what do you want, steak or chicken? Or maybe you'd like chops for a change. Philip doesn't mind a little shopping. I'm going anyway. He's got enough on his mind. Well, all right. Get a couple of shops. And what about you? You have to start eating. I'm eating. What? A piece of cucumber. I had quite a long talk with Sylvia yesterday. I suppose she told you. [Phillip] No, she didn't mention it. What about? Well about her condition and just in passing your relationship. My relationship? [Harry] It was just in passing. What'd she say? [Harry] That you get along very well. Oh. I found her a remarkably well-informed woman, especially for this neighbourhood. It's practically why we got together in the first place. I don't exaggerate. If Sylvia was a man, she could've run the Federal Reserve. You can talk to Sylvia like you talk to a man. I don't know about this doctor. What did the specialist say? We're waiting to hear. I like Dr. Hyman. And what is this with newspapers night and day? I like to see what's happening. [Harry] They've been smashing the Jewish stores in Berlin all week. [Phillip] My wife is very upset about that. I know. That's why I mentioned it. And how 'bout you? Well, of course, it's a terrible thing. Why'd you ask? I got the feeling she may be afraid she's annoying you when she talks about such things. She said she's annoying me? Can't believe she'd say a thing like that. She doesn't annoy me. She doesn't like to hear about the other side of it. What other side? These German Jews can be pretty. You know? They won't take an ordinary good job, you know. It's gotta be pretty high up in the firm or they're insulted. They can't even speak English. Well I guess a lot of them were pretty important over there. I know, but they're supposed to be refugees, aren't they? With 12 million unemployed and a fortune Roosevelt's pouring into that welfare mishegoss, you think they'd appreciate a little more. You almost sound like a Republican. Why? The Torah says the Jew has to be a Democrat? You know what mystifies me? Is that the Germans I knew in Heidelberg. I took my MD there. You got along with them? We had a marvellous student choral group. Fantastic voices. Saturday nights we'd have a few beers. We'd go singing through the streets. People applauding in the windows. [Phillip] Don't say. I simply can't imagine those people marching into Austria. And now they say Czechoslovakia is next and Poland. Nobody in the family ever had anything like this. You feel something though, don't you? I seem to have an ache. Not only here. My whole body seems. I can't describe it. It's like I was just born and I didn't wanna come out yet. Didn't wanna come out yet? What are you talking about? Dr. Sherman confirms my diagnosis. We can find no physical reason for her inability to walk. No physical reason? It's what we call a hysterical paralysis. People who are anxious enough or really frightened can imagine they've gone blind or deaf for instance and they really can't see or hear. Do you think Sylvia might have some kind of fear? Since they started putting all these pictures in the paper. Made her angry or something. At you? In general. Frightened. Tell me about her collapse. She was just starting down the. I'm sorry. Her legs turned to butter. I couldn't stand her up. She kept falling around like a ragdoll. She kept apologising. It's all right. I don't know what to do. She's my life. So what did David decide? He's not going to college. I don't believe it. With a scholarship? He says it wouldn't help him get a job anyway. Listen. Tell him I have to talk to him. Would you? I was going to ask you, but with this happening, I didn't think you'd- Never mind. Tell him to come over. And you must tell Murray he's gotta put his foot down. You got a brilliant boy. I wish I knew what is suddenly so interesting in the newspaper. This is not normal, Sylvia, is it? Murray says the same thing, I swear to God. He came home last night and said, she's gotta stop thinking about those Germans. And you know how he loves current events. They're making old men crawl around and clean the sidewalk with toothbrushes. Who is? In Germany. Remember Grandpa? One of the old men in the paper was his spitting image. He had the same exact glasses with the wire frames. I can't get it out of my mind. On their knees on the sidewalk two old men and there's 15 or 20 people standing in a circle laughing at them scrubbing with toothbrushes. There's three women in the picture. They're holding their coat collars closed, so it must've been cold. Why would they make them scrub with toothbrushes? To humiliate them. You can tell it to me. Is she crazy? Phillip, are you? Am I? In one way or another who isn't crazy? People like us maybe the craziest of all. Why? Because we don't know we're not and the other kind does. I said I don't think I'm nuts. [Harry] I wasn't saying that. But what do you mean then? You're not an easy man to talk to, are you? It's the way I am. They don't pay me for being easy to talk to. You're in real estate? I'm head of the mortgage department. Brooklyn Guarantee and Trust. In fact, I'm the only Jew ever to work for Brooklyn Guarantee in their whole history. Is that so? Let me tell you my approach. If possible I'd like to keep her out of that whole psychiatry rigamarole. Not that I'm against it but- How could this be a mental condition? It's unconscious. Take yourself. I notice you're all in black. I've worn black since high school. [Harry] No particular reason? I always liked it that's all. Well, it's a similar thing with her. She doesn't know why she's doing this, but some very deep, hidden part of her mind is directing her to do it. You don't agree? Well, I always like black for business reasons. Gives you authority? I wanted to look a little older. See, I graduated high school at 15. I was only 22 when I entered the firm. But I knew what I was doing. You mean she is doing it against me? [Harry] I don't know. What do you think? [Man] But I can think of no more certain way of sacrificing American liberty, destroying American equality, and betraying American democracy than to enlist with a British empire in behalf of a lost cause, which is not even our own. -[audience applauding] -[soft piano music] All her life she did nothing but love everybody. [soft piano music] Be straight with me. Is she gonna come out of this? Well, let's talk again after I see her tomorrow. Maybe I should tell you. I have this unconventional approach to illness, Phillip, especially where the mental element is involved. I believe we get sick in twos and threes, not alone as individuals. You follow me? I'd like you to do me a favour. Will you? [Phillip] What's that? I'd like you to give her a lot of loving. Can you? It's important now. Say you're not blaming this on me, are you? What's a bit of blame? Okay. Phillip. Yes? Try not to let yourself get mad. That's one miserable little pisser. I'm beginning to have a sour feeling about this thing. I barely know my way around psychiatry. I'm not completely sure I ought to get into it. Why not? She's a beautiful woman. Well is that a reason to turn her away? How you feeling, Auntie Sylvia? I'm worried, David. I guess we all are. I mean- No, not for me. For you. If I'd had a chance to go to college, I'd have had a whole different life. You're the best, Margaret. A lot of good it does me. If it really bothers you, I'll get someone else to take the case. You won't. You know you won't. Not here. Come on. Should I tell you what I'd like to do with you? Tell me. Yes, tell me. Make it wonderful. [phone ringing] [baby crying] Mr. Lentini. Mr. Lentini. Mr. Lentini, it makes no difference. I've given you two extensions. I don't have an option now. What's he supposed to sleep on the street now? Huh? With a muster guest. You hymie outfits. Excuse me, please. You wanna know something? You make me sick. Okay. I'm gonna tell you something. You know Hitler has the right ideas. You listening? Your men will be dead by February. I didn't hear you come in. I tiptoed in case you were dozing off. I bought you some sour pickles. Oh. That's nice. Later maybe. You have one. I'll wait. I was passing Greenberg's. I suddenly remembered how you used to love them. Remember? Thanks. That's nice of you. What were you doing on Flatbush Avenue? There's a property across from A and S. We're having to foreclose. Oh, that's sad. Are they nice people? People are people. I gave them two extensions but. Oh. How was it today? I'm so sorry about this. You'll get better. Don't worry about it. Oh. There's a letter from the Captain. [Sylvia] Jerome? General MacArthur talked to him twice. Hm. Imagine. I don't understand this attitude. Why? I'm happy for him. You don't seem happy to me. I'll never get used to it. Who goes in the Army? Men who can't do anything else. He could be the first Jewish general in the United States Army. Doesn't it mean something to be his mother? Well, I said, I'm glad. Don't be upset. I wonder what my tests show. That the specialist did. I went to see Dr. Hyman today. You did? What did he say? Phillip. I wanna change some things about the way I've been doing. Tell me what Dr. Hyman said. He thinks it could all be coming from your mind, like a fear of some kind got into you. But I'm numb. [Phillip] Can I tell you what I think? What? I think it's this whole Nazi business. They're smashing up the Jewish stores. The streets are covered with broken glass. Yes, but you don't have to be constantly- I can't move my legs from reading a newspaper. He didn't say that. I'm willing if you- It's ridiculous. You'll talk to him about it tomorrow. You have to get better, Sylvia. What is this? Am I dying or something? How can you say that? I don't understand what's happening. I never realised it. Look at me, will you? I wouldn't know what to do without you, Sylvia. Honest to God, I. I love you. What is this? You have to get better. Listen. I think Hyman's a very smart man. When we were talking, something came to mind. It may be, you know, if we could sit down with him, the three of us and maybe talk about, well you know, every- That doesn't matter anymore, Phillip. Okay. But if you wanna talk- We did talk about it. I took it to Rabbi Scheiner about it twice. What good did it do? Thought it would change by itself. It came out of nowhere. I thought it would go the same way. I'm sorry, Phillip. It didn't come out of nowhere. You regretted you got married. I didn't regret it. You did, dear. You don't have to be ashamed of it. I need to tell you the truth. I thought if we separated, I wouldn't die of it. I admit that. I always knew that. But I haven't felt that way in years now. Oh wow [laughs]. I'm here. Here I am, Phillip. I'm trying to tell you something. But I said I'm here. I'm here for my mother's sake and Jerome's sake and everybody's sake except mine. But I'm here and here I am. And now finally you wanna talk about it. Now when I'm turning into an old woman. How do you want me to say it? Huh, tell me dear. I'll say it the way you want me to. What should I say? I want you to stand up. I can't stand up. You can. Come on, stand up. I can't. You can stand up, Sylvia. You lean to me. And you just get on your feet. What are you trying to do? What are you trying to do, Sylvia? [soft dramatic music] -[keyboard clacking] -[soft dramatic music] [Myra] Mr. Case was hoping he'd see you before he left, Mr. Gellburg. Caught traffic over in Crown Heights. You all right, Mr. Gellburg? I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you. [hand knocking] Yes. Gellburg. Good. Sit down for a moment. We're sailing out through the narrows in about an hour. It's a beautiful day for it. Are you all right? You don't look well. I'm fine. Good. Have you come to anything final on 611? I like the price. I can tell you that right off. Yeah, the price is not bad, but I have a few comments. Before I forget. Had a very nice letter from Jerome. My boy. Oh yes. How's he doing? They bringing him out to Fort Sill. Some kind of lecture on artillery. Really now? Well, isn't that nice? Then he's really intending to make a career in the army. Oh, absolutely. [Stanton] Well, that's good, isn't it? It's quite surprising for one of you people. For some reason, I'd assumed he just wanted the education. No, it's his life. I'll never know how to thank you. No trouble at all. The point could probably use a few of you people to keep the rest of them awake. [phone ringing] Stanton Case. Hang on, Bill. Gellburg, would you excuse me for a few minutes? You know, I'm glad it's you taking care of her. My husband says the same thing. [Harry] Thank you. You probably don't remember, but you once took out her cousin Roslyn Fine. She said you were great. When was this? Oh, NYU, maybe 25 years ago. She adored you, seriously. You used to take her to Coney Island swimming and so on. Well, give her my regards. Now, 611. You might recall we use the ABC plumbing contractors on a couple of buildings. ABC? I don't recall. They're located in the neighbourhood. On a long shot, I went over there. I was wondering if they may have done any work for Wanamaker's. What's Wanamaker's got to do with it? Number 611 is just one block from Wanamaker, sir. They're the biggest business in the area after all. And sure enough, it turns out ABC is patching up their system because they cancelled installation of new boilers last winter. A permanent cancellation. [Stanton] And what do you make of that? I think it could mean they're either moving the store or maybe they're going out of business. Wanamaker's? It's possible. Either way, if Wanamaker's disappears, Mr. Case, that neighbourhood is no longer prime. Also Kevin Sullivan over at Title Guarantee says they turned down 611 last year and he can't remember why. [Stanton] And what are you telling me? I would not touch number 611 with a 10 foot pole unless you can get it at a good defensive price. If that neighbourhood starts to slide, 611 is a great big slice of lemon. You've been more than thorough, Gellburg. We appreciate it. I've got to run now. I mustn't missed the tide. Wife all right? Yeah, she's fine. Sure everything's all right with you? We don't want you getting sick now. No, I'm very well. I'm very well. Well, take a Brandy if you like. Yes, sir. I might. [soft orchestral music] Oh, Doctor. [Harry] Hope I'm not disturbing. Oh no, no. I'm glad. No, sit down. You've been riding? Yes, all the way down Brighton Beach. It's a long ride. I expected to see you jumping rope by now. I think you're just trying to get out of doing the dishes. Stop. You really love riding, don't you? Well, there's no telephone on a horse. Have you been trying the exercise? I can't do it. You gotta do it, Sylvia. You can end up permanently crippled. Let's have a look. You feel this at all? Well. Not really. I'm gonna pinch your toe. Ready? All right. Skin feels a little too cool. You're gonna lose your muscle tone if you don't move. Your legs are beginning to lose volume and shrink. I'm afraid you're getting comfortable in this condition. But what can I do? I can't feel anything. [Harry] I really should find someone else for you. Why? I don't want anyone else. You're a very attractive woman. Don't you know that? Sylvia, listen to me. I haven't been this moved by a woman in a very long time. Wow. You mustn't get anyone else. Sylvia. I can't play a game with your health. I know you wanna tell me something. I don't know how to get it out of you. You got to start helping me. You can't just lie there and expect a miracle to lift you to your feet. I would tell you if I knew. Couldn't we just talk? And maybe I could. I like you. A lot. I love when you talk to me. Couldn't we just like for a few minutes? Okay. What do you wanna talk about? Be patient. Well, I'm trying. Harriet says you used to take out our cousin Roslyn Fine. It's possible. I don't remember. Roslyn said you used to do acrobatics on the beach and all the girls would stand around going crazy for you. That was a long time ago. And you'd take them under the boardwalk. Nobody had money for anything else. Didn't you use to go to the beach? Sure, but I never did anything like that. Can we talk about Philip? I'd really like to. No, no, no, it's all right. Are you afraid right now? No. Not. Yes. Have you read Anthony Evers? No, but I hear it sold over a million copies. It's wonderful. Was Phillip your first boyfriend? Oh, the first serious. He's a fine man. [Sylvia] Yes, he is. Is he interesting to be with? Interesting? [Harry] Do you have things to talk about? Well, business mostly. I was head bookkeeper at Empire Steel in Long Island City. He didn't want you to work? No. [Harry] I imagine you were a good business woman. Oh. I loved it. Do I frighten you talking like this? A little, yeah. But I want you to. Why? I don't know. You make me feel hopeful. You mean of getting better? [Sylvia] Of myself, of getting. Getting what? Free? Sylvia. I want you to raise your knees. Come. Bring up your knees. I can't. You can. I want you to send your thoughts into your hips. Tense your hips. Strongest muscles in your body are right there. Now tense your thighs. Those are long dense muscles with tremendous power. Oh. Do it. Drop your knees. Come on. Come on, do it for me. Why are you so cut off from yourself? You should be dancing. You should be stretching out in the sun. Why can't you open up to me? Say anything, Sylvia. I promise I won't tell a soul. What is in your mind right now? Tell me about Germany. Why did you go there to study? The American medical schools have quotas on Jews. But they hate Jews there, don't they? These Nazis can't possibly last. Why are you so preoccupied with them? I don't know. But when I saw that picture in The Times with those two old men on their knees in the street, I swear I almost heard that crowd laughing, but nobody really wants to talk about it. I mean, Phillip never even wants to talk about being Jewish. Like some, you know, to joke about it the way people do. [Harry] What would you like to say to folks about it? Oh, I don't even know. Just to talk about it. It's almost like there's something in me. Silly. No. What do you mean? Something in you? Well I have no word for it. I don't even know what I'm saying. It's like. Something alive. Like a child almost, except this is a very dark thing. And it frightens me. That was hard to say, wasn't it? You have a lot of courage. I want you to imagine something. I want you to imagine that we've made love. I've made love to you and now it's over and we're lying together and you begin to tell me things that are way down deep in your heart. Sylvia. Tell me about Phillip. Think about it. We'll talk tomorrow again. Okay? [pensive music] [soft dramatic music] Coco. [Margaret] Calms the nerves. Have you lost weight? A little I think. Did you always sigh so much? Sigh? You probably don't realise you're doing it. You should have them listen to your heart. I think I'm all right. Well I guess I've always sighed. Is that a sign of something? Not necessarily, but ask Harry. I can't drink this. [Margaret] Are you eating at all? I came to talk to him. I was only trying to be helpful. I'm kind of upset. I didn't mean any. Come in again next week. I'm sorry but she means well. Won't happen again. I have to admit though. She has a very good diagnostic sense. Women are more instinctive sometimes. Excuse me, I don't come here to be talking to her. Come on, Phillip, take it easy. What's Sylvia doing? I don't know what she's doing. I decided to try to do what you advised, about the loving. Yes. So I decided to try to do it with her. Sex? What then, handball? Of course sex. What do you mean? You've done it or you're going to? You see, we haven't been really together for quite a long time. I mean, especially since this started to happen. You mean the last two weeks. And sometime before that. [Harry] I see. So I thought maybe it would help her if you know. Yes. I think the warmth would help. In fact, to be candid, Philip, I'm beginning to wonder if this whole fear of the Nazis isn't because she feels extremely vulnerable. I'm in no sense trying to blame you, but a woman who doesn't feel loved can get very disorientated, you know. Lost. Something wrong? She says she's not being loved? No, no. I'm talking about how she may feel. Your wife says I sigh a lot. Does that mean something? Could just be tension. Come in when you have a little time. I'll look you over. Am I wrong? You sound like something's happened. This whole thing is against me, but you know that. Wait a minute. What do you discuss with her? You know, she talks like you see right through her. I wish I could. We talk about getting her to walk. That's all. This thing is not against you, Phillip. Believe me. I wish you could trust me. I would never believe that I could talk this way to another person. I do trust you. Good. I'm listening. I was wondering if you could put me in touch with somebody. [Harry] You mean for yourself? I have a problem sometimes. Oh. Well that's fairly common, you know. Ever happen to you? Me? Sure. Few times. Is this something recent? Yeah, it's recent. And also. [Harry] I see. Well, it doesn't help if you're under tension, you know. Yeah, I was wondering that. Think of it like the ocean. It goes out. It always comes in again. But the thing to keep in mind is that she loves you and wants you. You know that, don't you? You know, my sister-in-law Harriet says you're a real hot shot on the beach years ago. Years ago. Yes. I used to wonder if it's because Sylvia is the only one I was ever with. Why would that matter? I don't know exactly, but it's just a print in my mind. Maybe she expected more. Well, that's a common idea, you know. In fact, a lot of men take on a lot of women. Not because of confidence, but because they're afraid to lose it. Hmm. I never thought of that. A doctor must get a lot of peculiar cases I bet. Everybody's peculiar in one way or another, but I'm not here to judge people. I'll let you try to tell me what happened. Come on. Give it a shot. All right. I come into the bedroom. She's sound asleep. She's even more beautiful when she sleeps. [soft piano music] Get into bed. Nothing like it ever happened to me. I got a big yen for her. I gave her a kiss on the mouth. She didn't wake up. I never had such a yen in my life. [Harry] Did you make love? Yes. [Harry] What was the reaction? She was gasping. It was really something. I thought of what you told me, about loving her now. I felt that I brought her out of it. [Harry] That's wonderful. Did she move her legs? Yeah, I think so. Got scared, didn't she? I got so excited I didn't really notice. I guess she must have. Well, that's wonderful. Why are you so upset? Well, let me finish. There's more to it. Sorry, go ahead. This morning I brought her some breakfast, you know, and started, you know, to talk a little about it. She looked at me like I was crazy. She claims she doesn't remember doing it. It never happened. So what do you think is behind it? What would any man think? She's trying to turn me into nothing. Now wait, you're jumping to conclusions. I want your medical opinion. Could a woman not remember? How did she look when she said that? She looked like I was talking about something on the moon. Finally she said a terrible thing. What did she say? That I'd imagined doing it. What's your opinion? Well. Could a man imagine such a thing? Is that possible? Tell you what. Suppose I have another talk with her and see what I can figure out. You have an opinion, don't you? Phillip, don't cross examine me. Frankly, I can't follow what you're telling me. You sure in your own mind you had relations? How can you even ask me such a thing? I don't understand your attitude. Phillip, please, what attitude? What are you talking about? I swear, I'm gonna vomit. I don't feel well. What happened? Has she said something about me? About you? What do you mean? What could she say? [Harry] I don't understand why you're so upset with me. What are you doing? What am I doing? What are you talking about? She is trying to destroy me and you sit there. What are you doing? Are you a doctor or what? Why don't you give me a straight answer about anything? Everything is in and out. Around the block. Listen, I made up my mind. I don't want you seeing her anymore. I think she's the one has to decide that. I am deciding it. It's decided. [soft dramatic music] [Margaret] Are you in trouble? Me? I don't know, why? You don't realise how transparent you are. You're a pane of glass, Harry. Nothing's happened. There's been nobody for at least 10 or 12 years. More. I can't remember anymore. You know that. You know what baffles me? Why I take your suspicion seriously? Now that's easy. You love the truth, Harry. [pensive music] No. [Margaret] What about asking Charlie Whitman to see her? She's frightened to death of psychiatry. She thinks it means she's crazy. Getting this hysterical about something on the other side of the world is sane? When she talks about it, it's on the next block. And that's sane? I don't know what it is. I just get the feeling sometimes it's like she's connected to some. Some wire. Goes halfway around the world. I think you've got to get someone on this who won't be carried away, Harry. I'm not carried away. Margaret, she knows something. I don't know what it is and she may not either. But I tell you it's real. [pensive music] [Sylvia] [screams] No. No. No. No. No. No. [Phillip] I want you to know how bad I feel about 611. Yes. Well, so it goes, I guess. They gave no sign they were talking to Allen Kruschwitz or anybody else. It's very disappointing. Certainly would have made it perfect annex and probably a great investment, too. Well, not necessarily. If Wanamaker's- Yes, about Wanamaker. When I found out that Kruschwitz had outbid us, I was flabbergasted after what you had said about the neighbourhood going downhill when the store was gone. Kruschwitz is no fool, I need hardly say. So I mentioned it to one of our club members who I know is related to a member of the Wanamaker board. He was simply amazed at the idea. But the men at ABC plumbing. ABC lost that boiler contract because Wanamaker's changed to another company. It had nothing to do with the store moving out. Nothing. I don't know what to say. Well, do you have any idea what Kruschwitz plans to do with it? Me? No, I don't really know Kruschwitz. Oh, I thought you said you knew him for years. Well, yeah. We met at closings a few times. Things like that. I see. I guess I misunderstood. I thought you were fairly close. I hope you're not. I mean, I never mentioned to Kruschwitz that you were interested in 611. Mentioned? What do you mean? Nothing, it's just. It almost sounds like I had something to do with him grabbing the building away from under you. Did I say you did? Look, I'm not clear about what you wanted to say to me or have I missed something? No, no. What you just said. What's the matter with you? I'm sorry. I'd like to forget the whole thing. [Stanton] What's happening? Nothing really. [soft dramatic music] [Man] Oh my goodness. What a man. * We went driving * * We didn't walk * * On love and please * I simply can't stand Eddie Cantor. Can you? Cut it out now. Heard you laughing halfway up the stairs. [laughs] I know, but I can't stand him. Crosby's the one I like. I can't stand these crooners. They're making 10, $20,000 a week and never spent a day in medical school. Anyway, I'm an opera man. [Sylvia] I never saw an opera. They must be hard to understand I bet. There's nothing to understand. Either she wants to and he doesn't or he wants to and she doesn't. Either way one of them gets killed and the other one jumps off a building. [laughs] Oh, I'm so glad you could come. You ready? We have to discuss something. My back aches. Will you help me onto the bed? Sure. Here we go. Did you hear all those birds this morning? A whole cloud of them shot up like a spray in front of my horse. You know, as a child, when we first moved from upstate, there were so many birds and rabbits and even foxes here. On Coney Island, we used to kill rabbits with slingshots. [Sylvia] Why? To see if we could. It was heaven for kids. I know. Brooklyn was really beautiful, wasn't it? I think people were happier then. I am so glad honestly. I feel good every time you come. Now listen to me. I've learned that your kind of symptoms come from very deep in the mind. I would have to deal with your dreams to get any results. Your deepest secret feelings. You understand? It's not my training. But when you talk to me, I really feel my strength starting to come back. You should already be having therapy to keep up your circulation. You have a long life ahead of you. You don't wanna live in a wheelchair, do you? It's imperative that we get you to someone who can- I could tell you a dream. I'm not trained- I'd like to. Can I? I have the same one every night just as I'm falling asleep. All right. What is it? [soft dramatic music] I'm in a street. [soft dramatic music] Everything is sort of grey. There's a crowd of people and they're looking for me. [Harry] Who are they? [Sylvia] They're Germans. [Harry] Did something happen? [Sylvia] Well yeah. I began to run away and the whole crowd is following me. They have heavy shoes that pound on the pavement. [soft dramatic music] Then just as I'm escaping around a corner, a man grabs hold of me and pulls me down. [Harry] Was that the end of it? [Sylvia] No. He tries to kiss me. I struggled, but I can't get away. And then he starts to cut off my breasts and for a second I see the side of his face. [Harry] Who was it? [Sylvia] I don't know. But you saw his face. Not Phillip, is it? I see. [soft music] I want to ask you a question. I can't help it. Help me please. I'm trying to. I feel like I'm losing everything. I'm being torn to pieces. What do you want to know? I'll tell you. I trust you. What do you want to ask me? Since this happened to you, have you and Philip had relations? [Sylvia] Relations? He said you did the other night. We had relations the other night. [Harry] But that. Well, he said that by morning, you'd forgotten. Is that true? Why are you asking me that? [Harry] I didn't know what to make of it. I guess I still don't. You mean you believe him? We haven't had relations for almost 20 years. 20? Just after Jerome was born. How did this start? I don't know. I never understood it. Just couldn't anymore. I guess you just gradually give up and it closes over you like a grave, but I can't help it. I still pity him because I know how it torches him. It's like a snake eating into his heart. I mean, it's not as though he doesn't like me. He does. I know it. Or do you think so? He says you're his whole life. Oh, his whole life. Poor Philip. I've been talking to a friend of mine in the hospital. A psychiatrist. I'll call you in the morning. Why must you leave? I'm nervous. Can't you talk to me a few minutes? I have some yeast cake. I'll make fresh coffee. I'd love to stay, but Margaret will be upset with me. Oh, well, call her. Ask her to come over, too. No, no. For God's sake, why not? She thinks something's going on with us. Oh. [Harry] I'll be in touch tomorrow. Well, couldn't you just be here when he comes? I'm nervous, please. You just be here when he comes. You don't think he'd do something, do you? Never known him so angry. And I think there's also some trouble with Mr. Case. Phillip can hit, you know. God, everything's so mixed up, but I don't understand. They write that the Germans are starting to pick up Jews right off the street and putting them into- Sylvia, I told you- But you say they were such nice people. Well, how could they change like this? This will all pass, Sylvia. German music and literature. Some of the greatest in the world. It's impossible for those people to suddenly change into thugs like this. So you ought to have more confidence, you see. I mean, in general, in life, in people. What are you telling me? Just say what you're thinking right now. I. [Harry] Don't be frightened. Just say it. You. [Harry] Me, what about me? How could you believe I forgot we had relations? [Harry] Now stop that. I was only trying to understand what is happening. Yes and what? What is happening? What are you trying to tell me? What's gonna become of us? [Harry] What has Germany got to do- But how can those nice people go out and pick up Jews in the middle of the street in the middle of a big city like that and nobody stops them? You mean I've changed? Is that it? Well, I don't know. One minute you say you like me and then you turn around and. [Harry] Listen. I simply must call in somebody. No, you could help me if you believed me. [Harry] I do believe you. No. You're not gonna put me away somewhere. Now you stop being ridiculous. What's gonna become of us? Stop. You are confusing two things. From now on you mean if a Jew just walks out of his house, do they arrest him? I'm telling you this won't last. What do they do with them? I don't know. I'm out of my depth. I can't help you. But why don't they run out of the country? What is the matter with those people? Don't you understand that this is an emergency? They're beating up little children. What if they kill those children? Where is Roosevelt? Where is England? You got to do something before they murder us. [soft dramatic music] Sylvia. Sylvia. [Phillip] What happened? [Harry] Throw cold water on a towel. What happened? Do it, goddamn you. [soft dramatic music] Sylvia. That's good. Keep looking at me. [soft dramatic music] Here we go. That's better. How do you feel? Can you speak? Wanna sit up? [soft dramatic music] [Phillip] Did she call you? Well, no. To tell you the truth. Then what are you doing here? I stopped by. I was worried about her. You were worried about her? Why were you worried about her? Because she is desperate to be loved. Oh, you don't say. Yes, I do say. I want you to try to move your legs. Try it. I'll be at home if you need me. Don't be afraid to call anytime. We'll talk about this more tomorrow. Good night. Good night. Some attitude he's got there. Ordering me around like that. I'm gonna see about getting somebody else tomorrow. Jersey seems to get further and further away. I'm exhausted. [Sylvia] I almost started walking. What are you talking about? For a minute. I don't know what happened. My strength started to come back. I knew it. I told you you could. Try it again, come on. I can't now. Why not? This is wonderful. Come on. Phillip, listen. I don't want to change. I want Hyman. What is so good about him? You're still laying there practically dead to the world. He helped me get up. I don't know why. I feel he can get me walking again. Why does it have to be him? Because I can talk to him. I want him and I don't want to discuss it again. We'll see. We will not see. What is this tone of voice? It's a Jewish woman's tone of voice. Jewish woman. What are you talking about? Are you crazy? Don't you call me crazy, Phillip. I am talking about it. They're smashing windows. They're beating children. I am talking about it. I'm talking about it, Phillip. Beating children. Nevermind. Don't sleep with me again. How can you say that to me? I can't bear it. They give me terrible dreams. I'm sorry, Phillip. Maybe in a while, but not now. Sylvia. You will kill me if we can't be together. You told him we had relations. Don't, Sylvia. You little liar. You want him to think I'm crazy. Is that it? No, it just came out. I didn't know what I was saying. That I forgot we had relations, Phillip. Stop it. Don't say anymore. Oh, I'm gonna say anything I want to. You will kill me. Oh, what I did with my life. Out of ignorance. Out of not wanting to shame you in front of other people. A whole life. Just gave it away like a couple of pennies [laughs]. I took better care of my shoes [laughs]. You wanna talk to me about it now? You take me seriously, Philip. Come on, what happened? I know it's all you've ever thought about. Isn't that true? What happened? Just so I'll know. I'm ashamed to mention it. It's ridiculous. When you said that you wanted to go back to the firm. [Sylvia] When? When you had your own and suddenly you didn't want to keep the house anymore. [Sylvia] And you didn't want me to go back to the business so I didn't. Well what? I didn't, did I? You held it against me. Having to stay home. You know you did. Not a day passed. Not a person could come into this house that you didn't keep saying how wonderful and interesting it used to be for you in business. You never forgave me, Sylvia. So whenever. When I started to touch you, I felt that. It felt what? You didn't want me to be the man here. And then on top of that, when you didn't want anymore children, everything inside of me just dried up. And maybe it was also that to me it was a miracle that you ever married me in the first place. You mean your face? What have you got against your face? A Jew can have a Jewish face. I can't help my thoughts. Nobody can. I tried 100 times to talk to you, but I couldn't. I kept waiting for myself to change or you, and then we got to where it didn't seem to matter anymore. This is a whole life we're talking about. Couldn't we? If I taught you how to drive, you could go anywhere you liked. Or maybe you could find a job you liked. We have to sleep together, Sylvia. No. [soft piano music] How can this be? Sylvia. Do you want to kill me? Is that it? Speak to me. [soft piano music] -[soft dramatic music] -[thunder rumbling] [soft dramatic music] Mr. Case isn't in, Mr. Gellburg. [soft dramatic music] [Stanton] Gellburg. Good evening, Mr. Case. I understand you wish to see me. There was just something I felt I should say. Certainly. Yes? I am more proud of Brooklyn Guarantee than almost anything except my own son. It's the only place I've ever worked in my life. I didn't want you waking up one morning and Wanamaker's was gone and there you are paying New York taxes on a building in the middle of a dying neighbourhood. But frankly, I don't even remember what this whole thing was about, but I. I feel I've lost some of your confidence and it's unfair I feel. I understand. But don't you believe me? [Stanton] I think I do. I mean, you don't seem to. The fact remains that I've lost the building. You're not still thinking I had something going on with Allen Kruschwitz, are you? [Stanton] Put it this way. I hope as time goes on that my old confidence will return. That's about as far as I can go and I don't think you can blame me. Can you? How can I work if you're this way? You have to trust in me, don't you? I'll have to ask you to leave. I don't deserve this. This is not fair, Mr. Case. I hardly know the man. I'd certainly never get into a deal with him for God's sake. What's happening here? What the hell have I got to do Allen Kruschwitz just because he's also a Jew? [Stanton] What? What on earth are you talking about? Oh, excuse me. I didn't mean that. [Stanton] I don't understand. How could you say a thing like that? Please. I don't feel well. [Stanton] But how could you say such a thing? [dramatic music] [Harriet] He's really amazing after such an attack. [Margaret] The heart is a muscle. Muscles can recover sometimes. [Harriet] I still can't understand how they let him out of the hospital so soon. [Margaret] He has the will of iron. But it may be just as well for him here. [Sylvia] He wants to die here. [Harry] I understand your son is coming back from the Philippines. [Phillip] She show you his telegram? He's hoping to make it here by Monday. Or will I last 'til Monday? [Harry] You gotta start thinking about more positive things. Seriously, your system needs a rest. [bell ringing] How stupid it all is. You keep putting everything off like you're gonna live 1000 years, but we're like those little flies. Born in the morning, fly around for a day till it gets dark and bye-bye. Well, it takes time to learn things. There's nothing I know now that I didn't know 20 years ago. I just didn't say it. Help me. I wanna go to him. Wait till Harry says it's all right. It's unbelievable. First time since I was 20 I don't have a job. You sure? How can I go back? He goes sailing around on the ocean. Meanwhile, I'm foreclosing Brooklyn for them. You gotta close down a business, throw somebody out of his home. Get Gellburg. Sent in the yit. But is all this news to you? That's the system, isn't it? But to accuse me- You're getting too excited, Phillip. Come on now. [soft dramatic music] I'm making a gorgeous pot roast. Can I bring some over? Thanks. Flora's gonna cook something. I'll call you later. Try to rest. I refuse to believe that you're blaming yourself for this. How can people start saying what they know? There wouldn't be two marriages left in Brooklyn. It's ridiculous. You are the best wife he could've had. Better? Tell me. The things she's so afraid of. It's me, isn't it? Well. Among other things. It's me? [Harry] I think so, partly. How could she be frightened of me? I worship her. How can everything turn out to be the opposite? I made my son in this bed. Now I'm dying in it. You're an educated man. I only went to high school. I wish we could talk about the Jews. I never studied the history if that's what you mean. I don't know where I am. You mean as a Jew? For instance, a Jew in love with horses is something I never heard of. My grandfather in Odessa was a horse dealer. You know, there are Chinese Jews. Yeah, I heard of that. And they look Chinese? They are Chinese. They probably say you don't look Jewish. That's funny. Why is it so hard to be a Jew? It's hard to be anything. No, it's different for them. Being a Jew is a full-time job, except you don't think about it much, do you? It's not an obsession for me. How'd you come to marry a shiksa? We were thrown together while I was interning and we got very close and she was a good partner. She helped me. Still does. And I loved her. A Jewish woman couldn't help you? Sure, but it just didn't happen. It wasn't so you wouldn't seem Jewish? I never pretend that I wasn't Jewish. [Phillip] Don't be mad. I'm just trying to figure out. What are you driving at? I don't understand this whole conversation. Hyman, help me. I've never been so afraid in my life. If you're alive, you're afraid. We're born afraid. A newborn baby is not a picture of confidence. But how you deal with fear, that's what counts. I worked in a paediatric ward for a couple of years and sometimes there'd be 30 or 40 babies in there a day or two old and they've got a personality. This one lays there stiff as a mummy, a regular banker. The next one is throwing himself all over the place. Happy as a young horse. Then little miss dreary. Already worried about her hemline drooping. And how could it be otherwise? Each one has 20,000 years of the human race backed up behind him and you expect to change him. So what does that mean? How do you live? You draw your cards face down, you turn them over, and you do your best with the hand you've got. What else is there? What else could there be? Wishing, I guess. That it had been otherwise. Help me. I wanna go to him. Wait. I'll ask Harry if it's all right. [soft dramatic music] She believes in you, Hyman. I want you to tell her. Tell her I'm going to change. She has no right to be so frightened of me or anything else. They will never destroy us. When the last Jew dies, the light of the world would go out. She has to understand that. These Germans are shooting at the sun. Be quiet. I never told this to anyone. Years ago, when I used to make love to her, I would almost feel like a small baby on top of her. Like she was giving me birth. That is some idea. You know, in bed next to me, she was like a marvel God. I worshipped her, Hyman, from the day I laid eyes on her. How can she be so afraid of me? Tell me the truth. You want the truth? Do you? All right, I'll tell you the truth. Look in the mirror sometime. In the mirror? You hate yourself. That's what's scaring her to death. With this Jew, Jew, Jew coming out of your mouth. The same time she reads it in the paper, it's coming out of the radio day and night. You wanna know what I think? That's exactly what I think. But there are days when I feel like going sitting in the shool with the old men. Put a Tallis over my head and be a full-time Jew the rest of my life. With the side locs and the black hat and settle it once and for all. In other times, yes, I could almost kill them. They infuriate me. I am ashamed of them and that I look like them. Why must we be different? Why is it? What is it for? And supposing it turns out that we're not different. Who you gonna blame then? [Phillip] What are you talking about? I'm talking about all this grinding and screaming that's going on inside you. You're wearing yourself out for nothing, Phillip. Absolutely nothing. Tell you a secret. I have all kinds coming into my office and there's not one of them who one way or another is not persecuted. Yes. Everybody's persecuted. The poor by the rich. The rich by the poor. Black by the white. The white by the black. Men by the women, women by the men. Catholics by the Protestants, Protestant by the Catholics. And of course all of them by the Jews. Everybody's persecuted. Sometimes I wonder maybe that's what holds this country together. And you know, what's really amazing is you can't find anybody who's persecuting anybody else. So what's the solution? I don't see any except the mirror, but nobody's gonna look at himself and ask what am I doing? Forgive her, Phillip, is all I really know to tell you. That's the easy part. I speak from experience. What's the hard part? To forgive yourself, I guess, and the Jews. And while you're at it, you can throw in the goyim. Best thing for the heart, you know. [pensive music] Thanks, Mrs. Hyman. Think your colours coming back a little. Yeah, been running around the block. I always knew there was a sense of humour somewhere inside that black suit. Yeah, well, I finally got the joke. [pensive music] I'll try to look in tomorrow. Bye bye. [pensive music] Are you all right in that room? It's better this way. We'll both get more rest. You all right? I want to apologise. I'm not blaming you, Phillip. The years I wasted, I know I threw away myself. Think I always knew I was doing it, but I couldn't stop it. For some reason, I keep thinking about how I used to be. Remember my parents' house? How full of love it always was? Nobody was ever afraid of anything there, but with us, Philip, wherever I looked, there was something to be frightened of. I've been tiptoeing around my life for 30 years and I'm not gonna pretend. I hate it all now. Everything I did is stupid and ridiculous. I can't find myself in my life. Or in this now. I'm not this thing. And it has me. It has me and will never let me go. I understand. I've always tried to seem otherwise, but I've been more afraid than I looked. [Sylvia] Afraid of what? Everything. Germany. Mr. Case. Of what could happen to us here. I think I was more afraid than you are. 100 times more. In the meantime, there are Chinese Jews for God's sake. What do you mean? They're Chinese. And here I spend a lifetime looking in the mirror at my face. Why we're different I'll never understand, but to live so afraid, I don't want that anymore. If I live, I have to try to change myself. Sylvia. Oh my darling Sylvia. I am asking you not to blame me anymore. I feel I did this to you and that is the knife in my heart. Phillip. Sylvia. Forgive me. [soft dramatic music] Wait. Phillip. There's nothing to blame. There's nothing to blame. Wait, wait. Phillip. Phillip. [soft dramatic music] [dramatic music continues]
