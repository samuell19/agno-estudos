I WAS ALWAYS KIND OF SORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU DIDN'T MISS OUT ON NOTHING. YOU HAVE TO KILL ANYBODY? HMM? I DID. I'M NOT PROUD OF IT. YOU EVER WOUNDED? NO. AUNT T. GAVE ME A RABBIT'S FOOT TO TAKE AWAY WITH ME. GUESS IT WORKED. (CHUCKLES) I NEVER BEEN HURT IN 40 YEARS AS A COP EITHER. GUESS THE GOOD LORD HAS SEEN FIT TO KEEP ME OUT OF HARM'S WAY. I BEEN BLESSED. REALLY BLESSED. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT... THAT NOBODY CAN SAVE ANOTHER PERSON. THAT'S BULLSHIT. YOU CAN SAVE ANOTHER PERSON IF THEY WANT TO BE SAVED, AND I'VE BEEN SAVED BY THREE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE. WHEN MY MOTHER DIED, AUNT T., SHE TOOK (STAMMERING) RESPONSIBILITY FOR ME. AND WHEN WE MOVED UP HERE TO CHICAGO, SHE WORKED 16 HOURS A DAY... CLEANING HOUSES, WORKING IN THE LAUNDRY, WHATEVER. SHE MADE SURE THAT I WAS NEVER HUNGRY AND I ALWAYS HAD SHOES. AND SHE WHOOPED ME WHEN I WAS BAD. (STAMMERING) SHE SAVED ME. AND THEN WHEN I GOT TO BE A TEENAGER, I WAS TOO BIG TO BE WHOOPED, SO I STARTED GETTING INTO TROUBLE. I STOLE A CAR. I WAS A CAR THIEF. THE COPS CAUGHT ME AND TOOK ME BEFORE THIS JUDGE, AND THE JUDGE GAVE ME A CHOICE... PRISON OR THE MILITARY. SO, I JOINED THE MARINES, AND THE MARINES MADE A MAN OUT OF ME. YEAH. I WAS SAVED BY THE JUDGE. (CHUCKLES) THEN WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE MARINES AND CAME HERE TO CHICAGO, I BROUGHT THE WAR WITH ME. STARTED DRINKING, YOU KNOW, HEAVY, AND DIDN'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. THEN I MET MY WIFE, AND IT WAS LIKE OPENING THE CURTAIN ON A DARK ROOM. THE SUNLIGHT JUST POURED IN. I WAS SAVED AGAIN BY HER. IS SHE DEAD? YEAH. EIGHT YEARS. (TRAIN RUMBLING PAST) DIDN'T MEAN TO GO ON LIKE THAT. I SAW YOU WIPING YOUR OLD CHICKEN-GREASY FINGERS ON MY SHIRT THIS AFTERNOON. YEAH, WELL, I RAN OUT OF NAPKINS. (LAUGHING) RAY, COME OVER HERE I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. (LAUGHING) COME ON. YOU WANT TO SHOW ME WHAT? NOW COME OVER HERE. I AIN'T GONNA BITE YOU. I AIN'T GONNA BITE YOU, EITHER. WHAT DO YOU WANT? COME ON. NOW, LOOK THERE. I WAS NEVER UNDER FIRE, BUT I GOT WOUNDED. WHEN I WAS A FIREMAN ON THAT FLATTOP, A FIRE BROKE OUT IN THE ENGINE ROOM WHEN I WAS FIGHTING IT DOWN THERE ONE DAY, AND THE ENGINE BLEW UP. I GOT THIS. (WHISTLES) YEAH. (LAUGHS) AIN'T THAT SOME SHIT? YOU BET IT IS. I STILL GOT MORE METAL IN THAT LEG THAN THEY MAKE NEW CARS WITH. WHAT HAPPENED THERE? YOU GET THAT IN THE EXPLOSION, TOO? THIS? HELL, NO. I... NO, NO. I... I GOT THIS WHEN I WAS A KID. IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT MY FIRST... MY FIRST MEMORY. I WAS ABOUT 3 YEARS OLD, AND THIS LITTLE OL' COLORED KID THREW SOMETHING AT ME. (CHUCKLES) IT'S COMING BACK... ANYWAY... PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ALL THAT. YEAH. THIS KID... HIT ME WITH A ROCK RIGHT THERE. YOU WERE COMING OUT OF BURK'S GROCERY STORE ON APPLE STREET WITH YOUR DADDY. HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT? (LAUGHING) NOW, WAIT A MINUTE NOW. HOLD ON. YOU SEE? YOU NEVER KNEW WHO I WAS, BUT I KNEW EXACTLY WHO YOU WERE, AND I HATED YOUR HALF-WHITE GUTS. SO WHEN I SAW YOU COMING OUT THAT STORE WITH THAT OLD DADDY OF YOURS, I GRABBED THAT ROCK, AND I JUST... (LAUGHING) DID WHAT COME NATURAL. ONLY BAD THING IS THAT AUNT T. FOUND OUT. SHE LIKE TO SKIN ME ALIVE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "THE ONLY BAD THING?" YOU COULD HAVE PUT MY DAMN EYE OUT OR KILLED ME. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) SHIT. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. GIVE ME A KISS, HUH? YES! I'LL CALL YOU NEXT WEEK, OKAY? OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GIVE ME A KISS. BYE-BYE. BYE. BYE NOW. GIRLS, GET ON IN THE CAR. I'LL OPEN THE DOOR. BYE, RAY. NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. PILCHER. (ENGINE STARTS) (BLUES PLAYING) LUCK. YEAH, BUT I'VE BEEN LUCKY ALL NIGHT LONG. UH-UH. YOU MESSED UP NOW. YOU ARE AT MY MERCY, AND I HAVE... NO MERCY. (LAUGHING) WATCH MY BOTTLE. HEY, VIRGIL, THIS DUDE BE STARIN' AT YOU, MAN. VIRGIL, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK LATER. I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION. NO. IT'S BETTER NOW. I MIGHT NOT FEEL IN THE MOOD LATER ON. COME ON, LET'S GO. GET UP. WHOA, NIGGER, LOOK OUT. (LAUGHING) ALL RIGHT. I'M HERE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT? WHEN I WAS DRIVING UP HERE FROM ARKANSAS, I DID A LOT OF THINKING. I THOUGHT ABOUT THINGS I'D NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT. I THOUGHT ABOUT SOME THINGS I SEEN IN MY LIFETIME... IS THIS GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF... WALKING THROUGH THE SNOW TO SCHOOL AND EATING WHAT YOU KILLED HILLBILLY LECTURE OR SOMETHING? YOU GODDAMN RIGHT IT IS. YOU MIGHT WANT TO LISTEN TO IT CAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY AIN'T BEEN LISTENING TO ANYBODY SO FAR. I DON'T NEED THIS. OH, I THINK YOU DO. AND LISTEN TO ME... FOR ONE MINUTE? I AIN'T GONNA BITE YOU. SIT. OKAY. WHEN I WAS COMING UP BACK HOME, THERE WAS A GUY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN ME NAMED BILL WATLEY, AND BILL'S FOLKS BOTH GOT KILLED BY LIGHTNING AT THE SAME TIME, THE SAME STROKE... WHILE THEY WERE CLEARING, AND HE WAS THEIR ONLY KID. SO HE STARTED WORKING, HE WAS ONLY ABOUT 15 THEN RIGHT AFTER THEY DIED. AND HE WAS PRETTY MUCH ON HIS OWN. NO OTHER PEOPLE TO SPEAK OF, REALLY, SO HE STARTED HAULING HAY AND WORKED AT A SAWMILL. AND BILL, HELL, HE WAS A BIG OL' BOY, KIND OF UGLY IN THE FACE, NOT TOO POPULAR AROUND TOWN, AND HE WAS REAL QUIET. WELL, HE WORKED HIS ASS OFF UNTIL HE FINALLY SAVED UP A LITTLE BIT AND OPENED UP A LITTLE SORT OF A FIX-IT SHOP... APPLIANCES AND SMALL ENGINES AND WHAT-NOT. AND WHEN HE GOT TO BE IN HIS 30s, HE FINALLY MARRIED THIS GAL, AND, YOU KNOW, SHE... HELL, SHE MADE HIM LOOK LIKE ELVIS PRESLEY. (CHUCKLES) BUTT-UGLY. BUT HE LOVED THAT GAL LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. (CHUCKLING) I GUESS NOT HAVING ANY FAMILY AND ALL JUST MADE HIM KIND OF WORSHIP HER. AND HE WORKED ALL THE TIME AND ONCE A MONTH, HE TOOK THEIR SPARE MONEY, AND HE TOOK HER TO LITTLE ROCK, AND HE BOUGHT HER SOMETHING. ONE TIME IT WOULD BE A DRESS, AND MAYBE NEXT TIME A LITTLE DOODAD OR EARRINGS OR SOMETHING. THEN ME AND DADDY USED TO GO ROUND TO HIS SHOP EVERY NOW AND THEN 'CAUSE DADDY ALWAYS LIKED PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T TALK MUCH, YOU KNOW, AND BILL, HE DIDN'T SAY MUCH, AND SO... BUT EVERY TIME I WAS OVER THERE WHEN IT WAS GETTING TIME TO TAKE HER TO LITTLE ROCK, HE TALKED A LITTLE MORE, AND HE HAD THIS SPARK IN HIS EYES. THAT'S WHAT HE LIVED FOR, SEE? (LAUGHING) AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS PATHETIC. I THOUGHT, WHY, THAT SIMPLE-MINDED SON OF A BITCH. I MEAN, I FELT SAD FOR HIM 'CAUSE THAT'S ALL HE HAD. AND AFTER BEING MARRIED 10 OR SO YEARS, SHE DIED FROM SOMETHING, SOME KIND OF CANCER OR LEUKEMIA OR SOMETHING, AND HE QUIT TALKING ALTOGETHER FOR A WHILE TILL HE GOT APPROVED TO ADOPT A BOY. AND THE SAME THING STARTED OVER. EVERY FOURTH SATURDAY, HIM AND THAT BOY WENT TO LITTLE ROCK. AND WHEN HE WAS LITTLE, HE BOUGHT HIM A TOY OR TWO. AND WHEN HE GOT OLDER, IT WOULD BE A SUIT AND TIE OR A BOOK ON BASEBALL OR WHATEVER ELSE, YOU KNOW. BUT HE SPENT EVERY BIT OF HIMSELF... BODY, MIND, SOUL, AND MONEY... ON THAT BOY. AND I WAS OVER THERE A FEW YEARS AGO, AND SOMEHOW I GOT AROUND TO ASKING THE POOR SON OF A BITCH ABOUT THE BAD LUCK HE'D HAD. AND HE SAID ONE THING, AND WENT BACK TO SHARPENING AN AXE BLADE. HE SAID, "BEING HAPPY AIN'T NOTHING MORE THAN "HAVING SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO "AND HELPING YOUR PEOPLE HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. "I RECKON THAT'S WHAT GETS ME THROUGH TILL TOMORROW." NOW, YOU AND ME... LET ME TELL YOU... HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON BESIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I MEAN, WE BOTH FIND OUT ONE DAY LATER ON IN LIFE THAT LIFE WASN'T GOING TO BE WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS. NOW, YOUR KNEE'S BUSTED ALL TO PIECES. NOW, YOU AIN'T NEVER GOING TO BE A FOOTBALL STAR. AND ME, I'M NOT ALL SCOTS-IRISH. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO FACE MY FAMILY AND TELL THEM THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET USED TO IT. NOW, TWO THINGS, VIRGIL. YOU BETTER GET SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO INSTEAD OF BACKWARDS AT, AND YOU GOT A WOMAN AND SOME CHILDREN THAT YOU OWE THEM SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. AND IT AIN'T ALL ABOUT YOU. NOW... (CHUCKLES) YOUR DADDY'S A GOOD MAN. WHAT CAN I SAY? I MEAN, I'M... HELL, I'M... I'M PROUD TO CALL MYSELF HIS BROTHER. DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT, OR I'LL KICK YOUR ASS. DON'T THINK I CAN'T DO IT. (TELEPHONE RINGS) YES, SIR, I'LL TELL HIM. OKAY. THANK YOU. (DOOR OPENS) EARL, THAT YOU? YES, MA'AM. AUNT T.: THAT WAS THE POLICE. THEY FOUND YOUR TRUCK. IT WAS JUST SITTING ON THE STREET OVER THERE IN ROSEDALE. THEY FOUND IT? WAS IT ALL RIGHT? SAY IT WAS FINE EXCEPT FOR THE BULLET HOLES. BULLET HOLES? AUNT T.: THEY SAY YOU CAN PICK IT UP TOMORROW. THEY JUST CHECKING IT OUT RIGHT NOW FOR FINGERPRINTS AND SUCH. HOLD ON A MINUTE THERE. WHAT HAPPENED? THEM FOOLS THAT TOOK IT, ROBBED A BANK, SHOT IT OUT WITH THE SECURITY GUARD. WELL, AIN'T THAT SOME SHIT. HUH. COLLECT CALL FROM EARL. RUBY? YEAH. (CHUCKLES) I'M FINE. I'M STILL IN CHICAGO. UH, I'M COMING HOME TOMORROW, RUBY. I DIDN'T FIND MY WALLET, BUT I FOUND MY TRUCK. YEAH. I'M FIXIN' TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT. WHOA. I'M FIXIN' TO TELL YOU A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS. (TRAIN PASSES) YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE YOU FOUND YOUR TRUCK, YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL LIKE YOU GOT TO RUSH OFF. IF YOU WANT TO HANG AROUND A COUPLE DAYS. NO, I NEED TO GET BACK. THAT NEPHEW OF MINE HAS PROBABLY RUN MY BUSINESS INTO THE GROUND BY NOW. ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GET SOMETHING OFF MY CHEST. IF I DON'T, IT'S GOING TO COME OUT SOMETIME, AND... RAY: AS SOON BE DONE WITH IT. EARL: WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME? IT'S YOUR DADDY, THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT HIM. HAVEN'T WE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THIS? DAMN. I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND. I'VE LIVED MY LIFE WITH A HATRED OF THAT MAN... RAY: AND NO WAY TO GET IT OUT. RAY: SINCE THERE'S NOT MUCH CHANCE OF ME HAVING IT OUT WITH HIM, I GUESS YOU ARE THE CLOSEST THING TO IT. YOU SAYING YOU WANT TO HAVE IT OUT WITH ME? I MEAN, WE ALREADY WRESTLED ALL OVER THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ONCE. NOW, THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KILL YOUR DADDY BECAUSE I ALWAYS FELT THAT HE KILLED MY MAMA. THAT'S IT. RAY: JUST HAD TO SAY IT TO YOU THAT WAY. RAY: I KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT, OR SO THEY SAY, BUT I JUST DON'T THINK I CAN EVER FORGIVE HIM. I'M GONNA GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT. VIRGIL? YES, MA'AM? THERE'S A BIG ENVELOPE ON TOP OF THE CHEST OF DRAWERS IN THERE IN MY ROOM. GET IT AND BRING IT IN HERE TO ME. HERE YOU GO, AUNT T. AUNT T.: COME ON OVER HERE. I WANT TO SHOW Y'ALL SOMETHING. COME ON, NOW, BOTH OF YOU. PULL THAT FOOTSTOOL OVER ASIDE ME. AUNT T.: SIT DOWN... AUNT T.: RAYMOND, THAT YOU LOOKING AT THE PICTURE? YES, MA'AM. WELL, WHEN YOU GET THROUGH LOOKING AT IT, I WANT YOU TO HAND IT TO YOUR BROTHER. YOU WERE A PRETTY WOMAN, ALL RIGHT. FOOL, THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' WRONG WITH THE WAY I LOOK NOW. THAT AIN'T ME, ANYHOW. THAT'S YOUR MAMA... THAT IS, IF VIRGIL BROUGHT ME THE RIGHT ENVELOPE. IT'S THE RIGHT ONE, AUNT T. EARL, PUT THAT PICTURE IN YOUR POCKET. DON'T BEND IT AND DON'T LOSE IT. THAT'S YOUR MOTHER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ME THIS. I AIN'T GOT TO DO NOTHIN'. NOW, YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF THAT PICTURE. (EXHALES) AUNT T.: YOU WAS BORN MAY 4, 1933. IT WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND ABOUT 10:30 AT NIGHT IN THE OLD HOUSE ON SECTION LINE ROAD BY THE TRACKS. I WAS ALWAYS TOLD I WAS BORN ON NOVEMBER 23rd. YOU ALWAYS BEEN TOLD A LOT OF THINGS. AND THERE WASN'T ANY REAL DOCTORS DOWN THERE IN THAT PART OF TOWN. OLD MAN COLLINS DOWN THE ROAD KNEW SOME DOCTORING, BUT HE HAS A STROKE, SO MAOTIS JONES COME DOWN TO THE HOUSE. WHEN I COME IN THE HOUSE, MAOTIS WAS LOOKIN' FOR PEPPERS TO PUT IN THE BED. SHE TOLD ME THE PEPPER WOULD WARD OFF EVIL THINGS. (CHUCKLES) MOST TIME, MAOTIS WAS LIT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE, BUT SHE'D BEEN A MIDWIFE A LONG TIME AND WOULD SOBER UP RIGHT OFF WHEN THERE WAS A BABY COMIN'. WILLA MAE WAS BREAKING OUT IN A SWEAT AND GETTIN' WORSE AND WORSE. MAOTIS SAID THE BABY WAS TURNED AROUND ALL WRONG... AND MAYBE THE CORD WAS AROUND ITS NECK, AND IF IT WAS GONNA MAKE IT, WE WAS GONNA HAVE TO HURRY, AND SHE WASN'T SURE SHE COULD DO IT. WILLA MAE... YOUR MAMA... TOOK MY HAND. TOLD ME SHE HURT BAD AND SHE DIDN'T WANT HER BABY TO DIE. SHE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT THE GOOD LORD WAS PUNISHING HER FOR HOW THE BABY COME TO BE. I TOLD HER TO STOP THAT TALK AND THAT EVERY LITTLE BABY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BORN IS BORN... THE GOOD LORD LOVE ALL THE LITTLE BABIES. THEN SHE SAY, "TIARA, GO GET RAYMOND." SHE WANTED TO SEE YOU BEFORE SHE GOT ANY WORSE OFF AND COULDN'T SEE YOU SO GOOD. SO I WENT IN THE KITCHEN AND GOT YOU AND TOOK YOU IN TO SEE YOUR MAMA. YOU WERE SO SCARED TO SEE YOUR MAMA LIKE THAT. SHE HELD ONTO YOUR LITTLE HAND, AND JUST FOR A MINUTE OR TWO, SHE HELD UP AND ACTED LIKE THERE WASN'T NOTHING WRONG. THEN SHE PULLED YOU IN CLOSER, PULLED YOU SO HARD, I THOUGHT YOUR LITTLE EYES WAS GOING TO POP OUT. I WAS CERTAIN OF IT... YOUR MAMA KNEW SHE WASN'T GOING TO NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN. AUNT T.: MAOTIS SAID WE WAS GONNA HAVE TO GET A WHITE DOCTOR FROM UP IN TOWN, AND I KNEW THERE WASN'T MUCH CHANCE OF THAT. THAT'S WHY I SENT JUNIOR UP TO TOWN FOR YOUR DADDY, EARL. IT WAS HIS MESS THAT CAUSED ALL THIS TO START WITH. BUT YOUR DADDY SAID HE WOULDN'T COME, SAID HE WASN'T GOING DOWN TO NIGGER-TOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. AND BESIDES, HE DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ALL THAT. THAT WAS THAT GAL'S PROBLEM. MISS CARRIE LIT INTO MR. PILCHER LIKE A WATER MOCCASIN, TOLD HIM TO GET OVER AND GET DR. PARKS AND GET DOWN THERE AND SAVE THAT LITTLE CHILD OF HIS. WELL, HE DID GO GET DR. PARKS, AND THEY ALL SHOWED UP TOGETHER... EARL PILCHER, DR. PARKS, CARRIE, AND JUNIOR. BUT EARL WOULDN'T COME IN. JUST SAT OUT FRONT IN THAT CAR. I'D LOOK OUT EVERY NOW AND THEN. I COULD SEE HIS CIGARETTE BURNING. BUT CARRIE, SHE COME IN. SHE LOVED YOUR BIRTH MOTHER. THEY WAS FRIENDS, REAL GOOD FRIENDS. WILLA MAE ASKED TO SPEAK TO CARRIE ALONE FOR A MINUTE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT IN THERE AT THE TIME, BUT I PRETTY MUCH GOT IT FIGURED OUT OVER THE YEARS. GOT MY OWN IDEAS, ANYHOW. WELL, OLD DR. PARKS WENT TO WORK, AND SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER, HE STARTED GETTING YOU STRAIGHTENED OUT A LITTLE AND ON YOUR WAY OUT. YOUR POOR MAMA WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN, SHE JUST WORE OUT SO BAD, SHE COULDN'T MAKE A SOUND. AND FINALLY YOU CAME IN ALL YOUR GLORY, (CHUCKLES) FACE UP, EYES WIDE OPEN, AND WHITE AS BED LINEN. I WAS STANDIN' RIGHT THERE, AND I LOOKED AT YOU, AND YOUR LITTLE EYES WAS LOOKING AT ME. YES, SON, I WAS THE FIRST PERSON YOU EVER SAW. WELL, THE DOCTOR CUT YOU LOOSE AND HANDED YOU TO YOUR MOTHER. AND SHE LOOKED AT YOU LIKE YOU WAS... I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAY IT... LIKE YOU WAS A ANGEL. AND THEN THE DOCTOR STARTED IN WORKING ON HER. SHE WAS REAL BAD OFF, AND SHE WAS BLEEDING, SO HE HAD ME TAKE YOU AFTER A MINUTE AND TOLD ME I BETTER GO IN THE OTHER ROOM WITH YOU AND RAYMOND AND LET HIM WORK. SO I BUNDLED YOU UP IN A BLANKET, TOOK YOU TWO AND MISS CARRIE, AND WENT IN THE KITCHEN. (LAUGHING) AND THEN, RAY, I PUT THAT BABY IN YOUR ARMS. RAY, WHEN YOU SAW THAT BABY, YOU SAID, "THAT'S MY BABY." "THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S YOUR BABY," I SAID. "HE'S YOUR BROTHER." THEN THE DOCTOR COME IN THE ROOM.
