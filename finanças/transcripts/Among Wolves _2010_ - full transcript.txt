Come here, Quero! Marquitos. Let's go to swim in the creek. Come, goat! Come, all! Yesterday, the witch went too far. It isn't painful any longer. Jump! it's cold but good. Come on, jump! You haven't touched water during the winter. So cold! It isn't cold anymore. Come on. Do you think she is looking us? Who? Mother. Of course, she sees everything from up there. How do you know she is up there? Father Antonio told me. Who behaves properly on Earth... ... goes direct to heaven. Then ... The witch has it complicated. Oh, the goats! Eah! Quero, Quero! Boy, come here! Quero, come here! Benito! Back! Go away, then! Don't be far from me, Quero. Release him! Go away! Away, away! Are you OK? And Lucero? Let's go home. What the hell did it happen? Coming here ... ... wolves have attacked the goats, and ... and killed five of them. Five? Damn Satan! Where did you leave them? What are we going to eat now, the dog? We could do nothing. Don't tell me stories. I have two useless boys who cannot even take care of goats. On top, you woke the girl up. Get lost! I don't want to see you again! Away! Don't hit me! Father is coming. Where are the kids? They should be in hell. Wolves have killed five goats. Damn it! If we don't pay them to the Patroon ... ... we are going away from here. And where are we going ... ... if we have no place to die? Look, Juan ... ... Get the money from somewhere, because I don't want to leave. I can not have more debt. But are you blind?, we have nothing to eat! And what the hell can I do? Take them away ... they became almost adults. It is clear that they are not yours! Boy. Prepare your bag, we are leaving. Where? To Patroon's home. For what? Stop asking and hurry up. OK, but Juanillo comes with me. No way. He stays. Without Juanillo, I am not going anywhere. You are leaving now, boy. So get ready NOW. Please, Juanillo, don't let them to take me away Come here. Come on, boy, get ready. Damn satan! Stay away from him now. NO! I don't want to go without Juanillo! Let him, asshole! Don't touch me! Boy, I don't have the whole day. Marquitos! Father, let me go! Stay still now! Let me go! Still, baby! Juanillo! Come here! Marquitos! Juanillo, run! Father, Father! Wait! Don't stop! Marquitos! Run, run! Marquitos! Come in. May I ask your permission, Don Honesto? What do you want? I am bringing you my son. What is your name, boy? Marquitos. I've been informed that you are skilled with goats. He is very good indeed. He had grown up among them. Ceferino. Ceferino! Yes, Don Honesto. Tomorrow morning take this kid to the old man's place. As you command, my lord. Careful man! you are going to scratch my boots. Sorry. Nothing more, Ceferino, and get my horse ready. At your feet, Don Honesto. Then ... ... the issue with the goats was solved, Don Honesto? By this time, it is OK. But the next one you are going to the streets. Is it clear? Yes, my lord. Lately, wolves have been very active, and ... Stop talking of wolves, Pig-mouth ... ... i am doing more than enough alouding you to use the house and the horse. God keeps you for many years. And you already know: Here I am ... ... to serve you. Father. Where are you going? Home. And me? Come, jaca, come. Doroteo! Let's go closer. Come on. Come on. Doroteo! But, Doroteo, animal! What the hell have you done? Nothing, Don Ceferino. Venancia was about to deliver, and ... ... I had to receive the baby. And? Well ... we are with no money. Don't complain, there are people worse than you. One thing, don Ceferino: If you don't mind, before you go ... ... if you can leave me some wheat breadcrumbs ... Don't bother me, Doroteo. What you have to do... is fuck a little less ... ... and work a lot more. Did u get it? Let's go. Pizquilla, leave him. Hopefully, they will be eaten by wolves in those lonely mountains. Come on! What do you expect? Good evening, Don Ceferino. Good evening, with God. Why are you so late around here, my sergeant? Some pigglets have been stolen, at Don Martin's farm ... ... And Balilla is the main suspect. Have you heard anything? I don't know, but no worries, if I hear something ... ... I will tell you immedialty. Perhaps you know that my brother ... ... wanted to finish that asshole? Besides, Don Martin ... ... is offering a good reward. How much? Around 20,000 pesetas. 20,000 pesetas ... Let's go. Have a good night and a good service. With God. Balilla has become such an asshole. Have you heard about him? A bandit. The biggest motherf... around Despenia-perros. By the war's end, he escaped into the bush ... ... and since then he lives robbing everyone. Pray god in order to avoid him. Look, boy. The Silence Valley. There are people who got eggs to live there. Let's go down. Come on! Good afternoon, Don Atanasio. Life in the countryside keeps you well. Do you still have the same bloody mood than ever, eh? Here I leave you a little of wheat, to hold the summer. Eah, I will be back this fall to take the goats. And the other sacks? If you tell me where Balilla hides, I will give you all of them. With God. Ah, and take car of this kid ... ... I brought him to help you with the goats. Hang it around your neck. As many goats cross the fence ... ... many beans you put inside the can. Understood? If you get more beans ... ... you are missing goats. You have to go and find them. Yes, sir. Come inside! Sir, all are here! Sir? Go away! Away! Who is there? You sleep there. Goat! Come, miner! Got you! Come here, miner. Boy! Herd them to the corral. Hey, goat, don't escape! Be calm, Lunara. Baby, come here, to here! Has it been bitten by a snake? No, it has a broken leg. Bring me some sticks ... ... a liitle of Gum Rockrose and a bit of flax-leaved daphne. Calm down, Lunara ... ... for the cork oak's debarking you are going to be jumping already. Go, Lunara, Lunara... ... be calm. Hold her from there. Gum Rockrose is good for hits. Go, take her to the cave. Go and bring a little of Rosemary. Sir, a wolf! Where? Out there. I was eating the rabbit ... ... then the wolf came, and stole it from my hands. Lucky enough ... ... that you had the rabbit. Otherwise, it will get you instead. You have to be really carefull ... ... with lonely wolves. Go there. Now. Throw it. Be still there. Come here. But never loose its face. Now you know ... ... how do you gain its trust on you. Before they attack you... ... the move very fast around you ... ... here, next to you... ... several times ... ...and rub you ... ... in order to make you panic. And when you start running ... ... they jump to your neck ... ... and it's over. Did they ever do anything to you? When I just came the first time ... ... they killed some goats. But then ... ... I was building their trust, and now ... ... they respect me. How did you do it? Using the same methods I showed you today: ... giving them food little by little. Place it well. And you put him inside the hole. More! There. The reason is because here ... ... the thrushes land ... ... in the horsehairs. The lonely wolf is trying him. It was a very strange day ... ... when she didn't hit me. She never loved me. Neither my brother. And Dad ... ... never could manage it. But here with you I am very happy. Who is there? There is no danger. Balilla is here. Pablito, you have to stay vigilant. Well, it is as usual: ... Someone stole in Don Samuel's farm ... ... and they killed the guard. All birds eat wheat, but the guilty one is always the sparrow... ... shameless people. All the fucking life fighting in the name of Justice ... ... and what for? To end like this? We became fugitives. Four days without sleep. Yesterday Doroteo told us ... ... that there are fifty Civil Guards looking for us. Now, I understand that asshole. Which one? Ceferino ... ... he had to give me five sacks of wheat. And guess what he told me? That he give me them only if I tell him... ... where were you hidding. Bastard! He really hates me! Since the Contrapartida killed his brother... ... he has been blind and blames us for it. When I was coming here with Don Ceferino ... ... we met with some Civil Guards. They were looking for you. They say that you stole some pigglets from Don Martin's farm. Damn it! Then thay asked Don Ceferino ... ... if he had information about your location. And? They also told us about a reward ... ... for information. I will stick my knife very deep on him. Let's go. Stay a little bit longer, to rest well, Balilla. No. The civil guards can show up at any time. Take it. Mechote, take this with you. Go carefully. Atanasio. And you? Me what? Why do you live alone? Don't you have family? Not many My wife and my childen ... ... were killed during the war. I was in the bush with the goats ... ... and suddenly, I heard a bomb blast. I knew something wrong had happen ... ... so I ran towards my town. When finally I arrived, I wanted to die. Only my Tomas survived ... ... the eldest ... ... who went out to fight in the streets. I lost everything. Everything the most loved. Then I came to this place. And here I am, with my sorrow... ... that keep here inside. My god ... ... they hunted them! Boy. Take the goats down . I am going to stay here, I don't feel ... ... well. Do you want a little bit of milk? No, no, don't bring me anything. I am a little apathetic. Well, see you tonight. Wolfy! Wolfy! Wolfy! Atanasio! I had such an experience ... ... you won't believe it! You are too warm. Yes. Get the herb for cold, and boil water with it. Go. Get well soon ... ... I don't want to leave this place. Get lost, this is not for you! Wolfy! Atanasio! Atanasio! Atanasio! Sir ... ... why did you come up here? I had too much heat ... ... and here runs a little bit of fresh air. Are you still in pain? Yes. Boy... ... I am leaving. Where, if you can not even walk? Far away. Where I want to go long ago. Then me too, I am going with you. What for? To be with my mother. Listen: ... If he has survived ... ... and someday ... ... you meet him ... Who? Balilla ... ... don't panic ... ... he is my son ... ... my Tomas. Take this. It will protect you. And don't ever aloud ... ... to extinguish the fire. Come, miner. Away! Away! Away! Atanasio! Atanasio! Where is the bloody old man? Caragorda, go up there, and tell me if you see anything. Atanasio! damn it! I don't have all day to wait! Why did you neglect the goats? Are you playing hide-and-seek with me? Hey, boss! Come to see this. Damn it! I already knew that you had little time. Let's go now, do you realise there is no one? Damn it! Take the goats out. You died saying nothing, eh? - Come here! - No! Are you going to tell me where is Balilla hidding, eh? - Don't touch me! - Where is he hidding? - I don't know! - Tell me or I will urge on you! The old man was helping him. Wasn't he? I know nothing. Damn your life, you are going to tell it. Let me free! Let me free! Let me free! Damn you, boy! Let's see who is going to eat who. I am here, stop shooting. Don Ceferino, only one went away. Relax, that one has a fatal wound. Caragorda, check the horses. I am going there, boss. Come, Manuel. Hurry up. Let's go. Wolfy. Wolfy? Take, eat a little bit. Look what I brought you. You will be cured with this. You will see it. Quiet, Wolfy ... ... nothing bad is going to happen to you. You will feel very good ... Fly. I am badly wounded. Take it. I have three bullets left. Stay here. They will follow my trail. Search dog, search! He is there, let's go! Throw the knife away. Throw it! Where is Balilla hidding? Tell me or I kill you. Where is Balilla hidding? Where?! Foolish Balilla! Soon, you'll meet with them. As if it he was eaten by the earth. How the hell could he escape? I don't get it. We have searched everywhere. Ramirez. - Yes, my sergeant. Let's look around the Fraile's creek before dark. As you wish. You take care of this feral man. Don't worry, my Sergeant ... ... before dusk you will have him in the barracks. Caragorda, go with them. Manuel. You and me are going to Doroteo's hut ... ... he knows a lot more than he says. Come on. Listen to me, tomorrow morning at the sunrise ... ... grab all your things and your family and get lost from here. But... why? Because Don Honesto said so. But Don Ceferino, in the name of God ... ... I've been here all my life. My wife and children are buried here. How you dare to do this? They are Don Honesto's commands. But, there is a way for me to help you. Tell me. You tell me this fucking time where does Balilla hide. Don Ceferino I have told you 1000 times ... ... and I swear by my dead ones, who are buried outside... ... I don't know where Balilla is. Start packing then, moron. I know where you'll find him, Don Ceferino. Pizquilla go inside, this is not your bussiness. Where, Pizquilla? Where the hell?! Several nights he stays in the One-Eyed's hut. Where his friends are all buried. There he is. Damn it! Boss, boss! Do you want me to go with you? And what the hell do we do with the feral man? How do you know that he stays in the One-Eyed's hut? I don't ... ... but tonight there is full moon. and the fog is coming, Father. Alonso! Damn her dead ones! My sergeant! Where is Don Ceferino? Don't worry about him, boss. Caragorda... ... he is already getting drunk in town. Shut up!
