-I am a dead man. -Totally dead. - It's bullshit, it's not my fault. -Total bullshit. -Well, what should I do then? - Wait what are we talking about again? -Dude, who are you texting with? - This new girl Jess, I told you about. I guess you finally get to meet her tonight. She coming to the party. - I'm so not looking forward to this party. I cannot even afford to buy my girlfriend a nice present on her birthday. - Listen, she's not gonna expect much coming from you especially knowing you're out of a job. - I know but I just thought maybe if I bought her something nice it might help smooth things over, you know. -Smooth what over? - The Heather situation we've been talking about for the last 10 minutes. -Screw that! - Well you know how insecure Abby can get. - Listen, the next time your ex-girlfriend sends you a drunk text at three in the morning asking you to go to her place and bang you forward that text to Uncle Matt. -Sure, I'll keep that in mind. -Uncle Matt's got your back. - Still, it's just gonna be a really awkward night. - Listen, I don't have much but maybe I can throw you a couple bucks, you can buy her some flowers. -No, no, thanks Matt, no. I appreciate it. Thanks. -I got this. -Well, damn right you got this! What, I sat here and watched you eat nine pounds of pancakes and all I had was this lousy cup of coffee. -Where you off to freeloader? - A buddy of mine works down the street says he might have a job for me. - All right, get going, I got this. - But hey, I'm looking forward to meeting this new girl of yours tonight. -Man, you're gonna love her. She's totally cool, super hot. A little on the aggressive side but... - Somebody's got to be the alpha right? We know it's not gonna be you. - She's got this freaky upper body strength too. You know this one time we were in bed... -Too much info Uncle Matt. -Yeah. Yeah, I thought so too as soon as the words came out of my mouth. -Hey I'll see you tonight? -Yeah, get going. -Let's go, get him over here. Come on you fucking Nip! I know you got some cash on you. Really? How about we speed things up, let's go! Check 'em, check 'em! I don't wanna hurt you. Who the fuck are you?! -Paulie, he's recording us! -Is that right? - Yeah, yeah that's right you want this all over the internet? - How about after I kill this Nip, I kill you and stick that phone of yours up your ass? - It's too late, I'm uploading this to my server as we speak! -Can he do that? -Yeah! Let's go! - Better not let me run into you again, camera boy! -You're a very smart boy. -How's that Mister? - You managed to diffuse a violent situation without having to resort to violence itself. - No, no it's Ok Mister you don't need to really. Thank you. -I'm a very rich man. Are you a rich man? -No, not exactly. -So... Take it. - I wouldn't normally take your money sir but I kind of need it. -Why is that? - I got laid off a couple months ago so thank you. -Today's your lucky day! I happen to have a job opening at one of my many family businesses. -Really? - Easy job, starts tonight, eight PM sharp! -Tonight? Tonight's my girlfriend's birthday party. -I'm sure she'll understand. Pays very well. Go here tonight, eight PM sharp. And the job is yours. -What's the job? -Go here tonight and find out. Very easy, very good pay. -Wait! The guys that tried to rob you, they went that way. -Oh I know. I'm trying to get them to call me a Nip one more time. Wish your girlfriend a happy birthday for me. Easy job. -Owen, it's beautiful! I'm never taking it off. - Well, you're beautiful and you deserve beautiful things. Happy birthday baby. - I just wish you could come to the party tonight. - Yeah I know, I wish I could be there too but I really need this job. - I know, it just sucks that's all. -Baby, I gotta run. -Ok, I love you, have fun and remember to call me when you can. -I will, love you too. And have fun at the party, Ok? -Ok. -Excuse me? Hello my name is Owen Preston. I was told to come here about a job? -[Voiceover] Come in. Your uniform. - I don't get it, what am I here to do exactly? -It's an easy job. You put on that uniform. You sit in that chair and watch that door. -I'm a security guard? -Yeah. -For a door? -Yeah. -Why? - [Guard] To make sure it doesn't open. -But what if it does open? -It's not going to because you're going to put on the uniform, sit in the chair and make sure it doesn't. - Well, wait, what's behind the door? -Nothing. -Really? - I swear to ya' kid, there's nothing behind the door. -Then why am I watching it? -To make sure it never opens. -You want me to spend the night sitting in that chair watching that door to make sure it never opens? -Wearing that uniform. -Why the security guard uniform? - Because you are a security guard. -You know what? I appreciate the job but I think I'm going to pass. It all feels way too strange to me. -It pays $500 a night. Five nights a week. Do the math kid. -That's $130,000 a year. -It's a 12 hour shift. And it starts now. (telephone rings) (dial tone) (game noises) (knocking) -Can I help you gentlemen? -Owen? -Yeah, how do you know my name? - [Guard with Mohawk] We have a delivery. -Delivery, what is it? -We need to deliver this box behind the door. - I'm not allowed to open the door. -Do ya' have a key? -Look this is my first night. Let me just call my boss, Ok? (telephone rings) -That's gonna be your boss. We'll wait out here. -Hello? -[Mike] Hey kid, how's it going? -Mike, there's two guys here. They say they need to make a delivery? - [Mike] I know, I just got the call myself. I'm really sorry kid. Deliveries almost always happen during the day. We had one earlier. - They say they want to go behind the door. - [Mike] Are they wearing our security guard uniforms? -Yeah. -[Mike] Good. Don't worry then. I'm gonna walk you through the process, it's easy. You see the phone I called you on? Pick up the base unit and turn it over. You see the key taped to the bottom? Take that key, it opens the drawer. Open it. -Mike? - [Mike] I know kid, don't worry about the other thing that's in the drawer for now. Take the large key, it's for the metal door. You open the door for those two gentlemen. Inside is a large corridor and a second door. You're gonna need to lock them inside the corridor. It's important to stay outside and lock them inside. The inner door will not open until the big door is closed. It's a closed system. You need to time how long those two guys are in there. Now, they're professionals. They won't be in there longer than they have to be, 10 maybe 15 seconds. - You need to close the door or the second door won't open. - [Owen] Yeah, give me a few seconds. -[Mike] When they're finished, they'll knock on the door three times. When you hear that knock and only then do you unlock the door. -You open this door as soon as you hear us knock three times. -[Owen] Yeah. - [Mike] But here's the important thing, if those two guys are in there for more than one minute, you cannot open that door ever again, got it? -Yeah. - [Mike] It isn't a yeah kind of situation kid, it's a yes or no situation. If those guys are in there for longer than one minute, you do not open that door no matter what you hear. I'll call you back in two minutes. (muffled arguing) (muffled screams) (banging on door) -Thanks. -You're welcome. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait what the hell just happened? (yells) What's behind the door! Please, tell me something! (telephone rings) -[Mike] How did it go? -All right I guess. -[Mike] You guess? Is everything Ok or not? - Yeah everything's Ok Mike, what's behind the door? -[Mike] Nothing. - Bullshit, then why is there a gun in the drawer? -[Mike] Protection. -Protection?! Protection from what? - [Mike] That building is in the middle of nowhere kid you... You never know what's gonna happen. -What's behind the door? -[Mike] Nothing kid, I swear. - Is this gun in here to protect me from something that might come out of that door? -[Mike] Maybe. -Maybe?! What's gonna come out from behind that door? -[Mike] Nobody! -No body, so possible a person? - [Mike] Listen, you're not gonna need to use the gun. The only people with business there are wearing the same uniform as you. -I don't want this job anymore. -[Mike] Listen, kid. I'll tell ya' what, I'm gonna call in someone to cover the rest of your shift tonight and we can talk about it tomorrow, all right? -Yes, please. -[Mike] Now we're short handed and it's the middle of the night so it might take an hour or two. You gonna be Ok? - Yeah, I'll be all right 'til then. - [Mike] But you can't leave before then. -I'll be here. -[Mike] All right. Hang in there kid. (dial tone) (cell phone rings) -Hey babe. -So, how's it going? - Good, sounds like a great party over there. -Funny you should say that. -Why is that? - We're not actually at the party. -What do you mean? - Hey buddy, you couldn't make it to the party. So we brought the party to you! (whoots) -What do you mean? - We all missed you, especially me. So as a birthday present, Matt used one of those find your phone apps to find out where you are and so we're here, surprise! -Abby no, that's a bad idea. -Don't worry. It's like two o'clock in the morning, I'm sure no one's gonna mind if your girlfriend visits. -Abby! - It's too late buddy, we're here. -We're here! - You had to bring Mia and Olivia with you? -Well, it's like I always say, "It's not a party until the lesbians show up." - He does say that, a lot actually. -Hey sweetie, let's jut assume the door isn't gonna open. But you gave it a really good shot. -I think I almost have it. Maybe if you helped? - I think you should take a seat, Owen do you mind? -Please, be my guest. - Mia may have had a little too much to drink at the party. -You think? -This place looks pretty cool. Do you wanna check out the outside? -Sure, why not? -[Mia] So what's behind it? -I don't know. - Don't you have a key, security man? - Yeah, but I'm not supposed to open the door. -Why? -Because that's my job, to make sure the door doesn't open. -Great job, are they hiring? -This isn't good. -Creepy place huh? - Yeah, I don't do well with creepy shit. Like abandoned buildings really freak me out. -Poor baby. I'll take care of you. -I know you will. -[Voiceover] (whispers) Help me. -Wait, did you hear that? -Hear what? - I don't know, it sounded like a moan. -It's probably just me. -Wait, there it is again! Are you telling me you didn't hear that?! -You're just trying to scare me because I told you these places freak me out. - No, I seriously heard something. -Jess! Jess! -[Jess] I'm not crazy. I swear I heard something. -We're outside. Plenty of things could've made a noise. (moaning) There it is again! Are you telling me you didn't hear that? I think it's coming from in there. (moaning in agony) -It's an air vent Jess. - My grandmother used to live in an old apartment. Sometimes the air vents sound like crying cats. -[Voiceover] (whispers) Help me! - So, I'm dating a rent-a-cop, huh? - Not for long the way things are going. -You've got to relax. I just wanted to see me boyfriend on my birthday. You're not gonna get fired. -[Owen] I know, it's just... - I promise, nothing bad is gonna happen here. -You guys gotta come! -Quick! - I swear, there was a voice coming from that vent. -What did it say? -Help me. Matt heard it too. - At first I didn't hear anything but then I definitely heard something that sounded like a voice. -What else did the voice say? -I don't know. At first I couldn't make out any words it just sound like moans. -Moans? Owen, did they tell you anything about this building or what's in it? - No, they didn't tell me anything. - So you're just out here watching a locked door in an abandoned warehouse? -Hey, it's my first night Ok? They didn't tell me shit. -Somebody could be in trouble. Somebody could be in there hurt! - Yeah and somebody might be out here a little too high and a little too drunk! - Hey listen asshole, I know what I heard! And so does your best friend. -Owen, I heard it! -Fuck! -Where's Mia? -I thought she was with you. -No. -Is she still inside? -But guys the voice! Guys, what about the voice! -Where is she? -[Olivia] We left her here. - I know where we left her but where is she now? - Ok, calm down guys, she can't be that far. Let's just look around. -Fuck me! -What is it? -Oh God! -Is she in there? - Must be, I didn't leave the key in the lock. How long has she been in there for? - Can't be more than two or three minutes. - Matt, how high or drunk or whatever is Mia? -Oh, she's right fucked! -That's what I thought. - I'm sorry guys, this is totally something Mia would do. -Who cares? This is perfect! Now you have an excuse to look behind the door. We can find Mia and whoever's voice we heard. -(stutters) Wait! -Wait for what? -Owen, what's behind that door? -I honestly don't know. -How do you not know? -They didn't tell me. -[Olivia] Why? -Because they weren't expecting a small army of my friends to show up here unexpected and drunk as shit opening the goddamn door, that's why! - I heard someone's voice saying, "Help me" from behind this door so I'm gonna open it and find out if someone needs help. -I'm going to find Mia. - [Jess] All right it's decided, we're going in. -Wait, no, no, no, no hold on! Stop! Fuck! -What are you waiting for? Give me that. -Hey, buddy. You Ok? - I really wish you guys hadn't of come. -Owen? -Yeah? -What is this place? -I don't know. -[Olivia] Hello? - She must have gone behind that door. -Did you guys hear that? -[Olivia] Mia. - I really don't wanna go down there. -[Olivia] Mia? Mia? Hey, you pussies coming or what? -[Owen] Abs, what is it? -The sheet, it moved. - [Owen] What do you mean it moved? -I saw it, it moved. -It's just a mannequin. -But I saw it move. -Mannequin! -Hey guys? I keep hearing noises from behind this door. Can we just find Mia and get the hell out of here? -Yeah. I like that plan. -Back up. -[Owen] I want to go home now! -[Jess] We can't leave! We have to go down there. -I think he was joking. -[Owen] No! No, I'm not joking, I really want to go home now! - So what, you guys want to head back now? - [Olivia] No, we have to find Mia. -I'm Ok staying. -Did you guys hear that? -[All] Yeah! -[Olivia] Mia, is that you? Stop fucking around, I'm being serious. - Which hallway do you think the sound came from? -It came from down there. -[Owen] Yeah. - [Olivia] No, it came from down there. - [Jess] It definitely came from this way. -[Owen] Fuck, this is crazy! -We need to split up! -Are you crazy? -This place looks huge, we'll cover way more ground if we split up. - [Matt] Hey, I don't like that idea. -Owen? -Jess and Livie are right. We need to find Mia and get out of here ASAP. -(mumbles) - I don't care about that other person. -Yeah, well I do! - [Abby] More than you care about us? -Hey, hey! Let's keep it cool Ok? Abby, you and me, we stick together. - K, then Jess and I are staying together too. - Great, where does that leave me? - Don't worry, you're not going alone. -Come with us. -Yeah. - All right, well you three go that way and Matt and I will take this hallway. - I say we head out for no more than 10 minutes. And we meet right back here. -Whoa, whoa, whoa wait! We turn around and head back in 10 minutes? Or we meet back here in 10 minutes? - We each head out in our own direction for 10 minutes and then we turn around Matt, Ok? -Got it. -Ok, if anybody sees anything, anything at all, you scream and the other group comes running! -Ok. -[Owen] Olivia? -I don't know about you guys but this place is really starting to creep me out. -Starting to? This place gave me the creeps the moment we walked in! - [Owen] Sure this place has a huge creep factor to it but it's just an old building. There's nothing to fear Abby. -[Olivia] Just a building? Then why do they have a security guard watching that door 24 seven? - What about this person that Matt and Jess heard down here? - I was just trying to be comforting. -[Olivia] Do you guys hear that? -[Owen] I don't hear anything. Just keep walking. -[Voiceover] (whispers) Olivia. - [Abby] Any idea what this place was used for before it was shut down? - [Owen] It used to be an old meat-packing plant. I saw a sign out front when I first got here. (banging) -You shouldn't be down here. (screams) (mumbling) -Are you Ok, what happened? - The girl like me, she was right there. -[Owen] What? - Behind that thing, I just saw her, she was right in my face. - [Abby] Olive, you're not making any sense. -We didn't see anybody. - [Olivia] I heard noises and I heard voices. -[Abby] A voice? - When I turned around, she was right in front of my face! -[Owen] Olivia. -I know, I know it sounds crazy. But I know what I saw. -[Abby] It's Ok, we believe you. -You guys hear that? -[Olivia] Yeah. -[Abby] What do you think it is? -I don't know. Ok look, we still got a few minutes before we need to head back, Ok? - I'm really gonna start to freak out. - Olivia, are you Ok moving forward? - Yeah, I don't want Mia down here by herself. (screeching) -Fuck! - Ok look Olive, if you're Ok we're going to keep looking. -Wait! -[Jess] Why? -Do you hear that? -No. -Weird, sounded like footsteps. - It's probably just the echo of our footsteps. Come on, we need to go further. How much time do we have left? -Couple minutes still. -Matt, please stop that. -Oh, sorry I'm nervous. It's kind of what I do when I'm nervous. - What the fuck is with all these weird lamps anyways? Matt? What are you doing? -There's someone else down here. -No, there's not. -Yeah it is, I heard footsteps and look what they did to my can. -You did that. -No, I didn't. -Yes, you did. I saw you. -No. - I asked you to stop kicking that around because you're annoying the shit out of me. -Yeah. - And then, you stepped on it like a little kid. -No. I heard footsteps and then I left the can here uncrushed. Then I heard more footsteps, then the sound of a foot crushing a can and then I came back here and I found the can like this. -Matt, this is crazy! I saw you crush this can. Just like that. - There's somebody else down here. I think they're down that hallway. -Down this hallway? - Yeah, you just can't see it 'cause it's so dark. -There's nobody else here. Here, I'll show you. Hello? -Wait. -Is anybody here? Is anybody crushing any pop cans? Hello? Come out, come out where ever you are. -Jess, don't go down that... Fuck! -[Voiceover] Matt? -Jess? Jess? What the fuck is wrong with you Jess? - I told you, there's nobody else here. Jess? (whispers) Run! -Oh shit! -[Matt] Come on! -[Jess] Why are we running? -Come on get in! I think we lost him. -Lost who? -The guy? He was behind you. -What are you talking about? -Wait, you saw him? -I didn't see anything. You were freaking out, started running so I ran after you, that's it. -What? Wait. No, no, no, no. -Matt, are you Ok? (screams) Are you Ok? -Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm Ok I just tripped over this dead body! Please tell me you see the dead body. -I see it, I see it, I see it! -Fuck, fuck, fuck this is so fucked up! -Try and stay calm. -Stay calm? I haven't been calm since we're been down here, Ok? Let's just get the fuck outta' here, fuck Mia! -You know we can't do that. -The fuck I don't! -[Owen] Mia? -Mia? -[Owen] Mia, where you go? -Mia, you in here? -Mia? -Come on. - [Owen] This isn't time for your games Mia. Come out! -Mia? -[Owen] Mia? -Hey, Mia? -Let's try in here, Mia? -[Owen] Mia! -Hey, Mia where are you? -[Abby] Mia? - [Owen] Mia, you better not be hiding. This isn't funny. -[Abby] Mia? Mia! -[Olivia] Mia? Mia, are you in here? (screams) Owen, Abby! -[Owen] Over there! -[Olivia] Owen? -[Owen] Olivia! (yells) Here quick, take it, take it. Olivia! Are you Ok? - Yeah the door it just, it won't open! There's no handle, it's closed. -Are you Ok? - [Olivia] Yeah, I'm just stuck in here. - Oh my God, what are we gonna do? -[Owen] Olivia. Our 10 minutes is up. I'm gonna go get Matt to help open the door, Ok? - Abby, I want you to stay with her Ok, keep her safe. -You said you wouldn't leave me! -Abby, go with Owen. -Olive, are you sure? You're gonna be alone here. - Yeah, I don't have any other choice. -Ok, we'll be quick. -Hey Abs? -Yeah? - When see Mia, can you smack her up side the head for me? -You got it. -Come on. -What are you doing? - I just wanna take a closer look. -Closer look, it's a dead body. I can see that from up here. -He has a knife in his hand. I think he may have killed himself. -Killed himself? By slitting his own throat. Is that even possible? -I don't know. The real question is, what's down here that would make someone cut their own throat? - I don't wanna sound like an asshole but maybe we should get back to Owen, Abby and Olivia. Look for Mia together. - Matt, how much time do we have left. Matt? -There's somebody out there. -Where? - Out there he's trying not to move. Trying to hide but he's out there. -I don't see anything. -He's trying not to move. -If it's not Mia, I don't care. -That's not Mia. -That's not Mia. -Can we go now. -Now is a better time to go. -No, no, no, no, no, no. (pounding) (footsteps) Owen? Matt? (door rattles) -[Voiceover] (whispers) Olivia. -[Voiceover] (whispers) Olivia. (screams) -I think we're good. I don't think he followed us. Wait. Hello? - [Abby] Jess, Matt is that you guys? -[Matt] Thank God. -Yeah, it's us, where's Olivia? - [Owen] She's Ok, she got trapped in this room. The door got wedged closed. We just need you guys' help to get it open. -Hey, are you guys Ok? -[Jess] Yeah. You should be careful though. Somebody else is down here with us. -You saw somebody down here? - Oh, yeah and I forgot to mention we also saw a dead body too. -Dead body? -[Matt] I'm serious. - I think he may have killed himself but I don't know for sure. I could have been murder. -Oh God. -The guy you saw down here. Did you talk to him, did he say anything? -No, he didn't say shit. He just stood there at the end of the hall staring at us. -Something's going on down here. I don't know what it is but that guy we found may have killed himself instead of facing it. - We just need to find Mia and Olivia and get the fuck out of here. -Yeah. -This way. - [Abby] I think she was looking for Mia when (unclear). - [Owen] We couldn't get it open for the life of us. - [Matt] Don't use that expression, please. - [Jess] You mean this door up here? -[Owen] Yeah. -[Jess] This open door up here? -Wait! Olivia? Olivia? -It's empty. -Where's Olivia. - [Jess] Are you guys sure this is where you left her? -Yeah, this is the room. Why would she leave? - Maybe she didn't want to stay in this dark, creepy room all by herself. - We didn't want to leave her here by herself. It was her idea. -Hey, we had to leave her here. We needed help getting the door open. -Hey, no one's blaming you guys. - Matt and I would have done the exact same thing. -[Abby] Maybe we should go back. - Yeah, we can go back to the desk and call for help. - We can't just leave the two of them down here with whoever Matt and I saw. - We can go back to Owen's desk, call for help and bring the police down here to look. - Yeah, guys with more flashlights and guns. - We're not leaving them down here. -You don't even know them. -Yeah and you do. They're your friends. How can you just leave them down here so easily? I'm gonna keep going. Even if I have to go by myself. -Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Take this. -[Matt] What's this for? -It's the key to the main door. Take Abby and go back there, get to a safe place and call the cops. -No, you can't. We can't split up again. - It's my fault Mia and Livie are down here in the first place, Ok? I can't leave them, especially if Matt and Jess said they saw a stranger down here. - No, it's my fault, we shouldn't have even come out here. - It's my fault, I should not have left the key and the door unattended. It was literally my job to watch the door. Get to a safe place, call the cops. We'll find the girls. Go! Go, please. Hey, take care of my girlfriend. -Got it. -[Owen] Watch your step. -[Jess] Thanks. - Is it just me or are you a lot less spooked by all this? -I'm just good at hiding it. -Well, keep up the good work because you keeping calm is probably the only thing keeping me calm right now. -My mom was in the army so we moved around a lot. Kids always made fun of me. So I learned how to handle situations. -Yeah? -Yeah. You try being the new kid in school over a dozen times, it sucks. - Hey your girlfriend seems pretty interested in finding Mia and Olivia. -Yeah. She's like that. A little too gung-ho for my tastes right now. -I noticed that. -What? -Don't get mad. But does it seem like Owen is a little interested in your girlfriend? -No. What are you talking about? -[Abby] I don't know. I just have this feeling. -Abs, you know how Owen is. He just feels guilty that Mia was able to find the key and open that stupid door. He just wants to make it right, that's who he is. -Yeah, maybe you're right. (scraping) -What? -Did you hear that? -No. -I thought I heard something. -You thought or you're sure? -Yeah, I'm sure. - First the dead body, now these creepy noises. -The body? What was that like? -So weird. His throat was slit? -Ear to ear. He had a knife in his hand. Blood everywhere. -[Abby] That's horrible. He didn't die of no heart attack. -[Abby] Jesus. - Honestly what freaked me out more was the guy we saw after. - Do you think that's the same guy whose voice you and Jess heard outside? -Don't know, don't care. But, even before we saw the dead body things were strange. -What do you mean? - I kept hearing things that Jess didn't or at least she said she didn't. -Why would she lie? - I swear, I heard footsteps behind us, she claims she never did. -Strange. -Even worse, I was kicking this pop can around and then I stopped kicking it, then I walked past it and then I heard the sound of a can being crushed. -And? -And then when I came back, the can had in fact, been crushed. -But did you see anyone? -No and when I showed Jess, she just swore that she saw me crushing the can. But Abs, I swear, I didn't. -[Abby] This is so fucked up. - [Matt] There's something going on it this place. -What do you think it is? Is this place haunted? -I don't know. Maybe. Maybe it's just a fucked up place that mind fucks anybody who comes in here. - Maybe that's why Owen was hired to make sure that door didn't open. Let's just get the fuck out of here. -Yeah. -[Abby] Did you hear that? -[Matt] Yeah. I think it's coming from in there. -Mia? Olivia, are you guys in here? Ay, wait here. -No. -See something? -No I thought... No, it's nothing. -[Owen] Yeah, me neither. What do you see? -There's nothing in here. But I swear, I heard something from this area. (heavy breathing) Owen, bring that light. (screams) -You. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. -Friend of yours? -Not really. - What the fuck do you want with me? - I knocked you out so we can talk like humans. Are you gonna be cool? -Fuck no! Wait, wait, Ok! Wait, Ok. -You, you're one of them. -One of who? - What the fuck is this douche bag talking about? How does he know you? - I saw him this morning, he was mugging some guy. - That Jap is the reason I'm here. And you're with him. -What are you talking about? - What the fuck are the both of you talking about? - Earlier today, I stopped this guy and his buddy from mugging the guy that gave me this job. -My brother Bobby, where is he? -How would I know? -Fuck you security boy! After Bobby and I left that guy alone, that Jap bastard came after us. And beat the shit out of me and my brother like a fucking ninja! -So how did you get here! In a fucking box. I blacked out in the alley. I woke up in the back of a van. Two dudes, big dudes wearing that security guard uniform were driving. - Two guys in a security uniform bought you here in a box? -But I got my hits in. -What do you mean? I broke out of that box and started beating the shit out of those cocksuckers, but there was two of them. What could I do? - Did they tell you anything about this place? -Yeah. They said that I was gonna die in here. -They threatened to kill you? - They just said they were taking me to a place where I was going to die. This place is really fucked up. -Why do you say that? -It just is man! Ever since I got here I keep hearing things and seeing things. -Like what? -I hear talking and voices. And there was this girl. -A girl? Mia. -I was walking down a hallway and I heard a scream. This girl... it came from some room. I tried to open the door and it was stuck. -Olivia! When I got it open, this chick comes running out scared as all hell, shoved me aside and runs off. -She ran away? - I tried to follow her but it was too dark. Then I heard another scream. -Why would she scream again? - When I finally caught up to her, she fell down a small flight of stairs. -What? -The girl is dead man. -What do you mean she's dead?! - She must've fallen down the stairs pretty hard. The back of her head was all crushed in. -Oh Jesus. -I don't believe you. -I don't give a shit. I just wanna find my brother and get the fuck out of here. -Your brother? -Bobby! He was in the alley with us. I think they got him too. I need to protect him. He's my little brother. There's something down here with us. -What do you mean? -Those security guards kept talking shit about an evilness down here. -You're fucking crazy. -[Jess] Let him talk. Look, we don't disagree that there is something strange down here. But we would they throw you and your little brother in here. -To feed it. - See what I told you, he's fucking crazy! -They feed whatever's down here so that it doesn't get restless and try to get into the world. - So what they threw you and your brother to feed some fucking evil force? -Like feeder fish. -Exactly. -Feeder fish? - When you own a fish like a piranha you need to have a separate tank to keep smaller fish. -And when the piranha, you drop one of the smaller fish into the tank with it. -Feeder fish. That's why we're here. We're food. - You're sounding crazy just like him, you know that? - When me and Matt were alone looking for Mia, things kept happening. He kept hearing voices I didn't hear, seeing things I didn't see. -Really? -And then there was this pop can and I saw him crush it with his foot but a moment later, he said he didn't do it. He thought someone was following us. - But the dead body, you both saw the dead body right? -Yeah, that was real. We both saw it and I touched it. - (stutters) Wait, you found a body too? -What? -Your brother. -Bobby? No. -What did he look like? -Early twenties. Girls think he's good looking. He has a goatee kinda like mine. -Oh God. -What are you telling me? -Earlier we found a body. I think it might have been your brother. -Where is he? If Bobby's dead, so are you. All of you! -You Ok? -Yeah. -So what do you think? - I think this place is fucked up. I also think that guy is a crackhead who probably doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. -And Olivia? -I don't believe him. I have to find her and see for myself. Ay, are you Ok? - Yeah, it wasn't my favorite shirt anyway. -Here. -No, it's Ok. -Please. You're gonna be cold. -Thanks. -It's my fault. I should have never bought you guys into the office. I should have never left the key alone. -Hey, this is not your fault. Don't go losing your shit on me now Ok. We stick to the plan. We find Mia and Olivia and we get the fuck out of here. Ok? -Yeah. - This fucking thing is stuck or the key isn't working. - It's the same key Owen used to open the door earlier. -Well, I don't know. I've been trying for awhile, you're more than welcome to try again. (whispering) -Did you hear that! -No. -There it is again. -Abs, what are you doing? - I heard something, maybe it's Owen and Jess. Maybe they found the girls. Owen. Jess? -Wait. Abby, wait! Wait! -She's not in here. -Nothing in here. -Wait, just give me one second. -What for? - Honestly, I just need to take a piss real bad. Just wait here. -Really? -Hold this. - When you gotta go, you gotta go. -Can you move please? -Piece of shit phone. (whispers) (kicking can) -What is it, what is it? -Who were you talking to? -When? -Just now, in there? -I wasn't talking to anybody, I was just taking a piss in the corner. - Owen, I saw you talking to a man in there and I heard him talking to you. -What did he say? - I don't know, I couldn't make out the words. But I heard it. I swear! - I wasn't talking to anybody in there. I was alone. -And then I heard this pop can being kicked around and crashed just like Matt did. -Hey, hey, it's Ok. Apparently this place it messes with people's minds. Don't let it. -Thank you. - Ok, let's get you back outside to Matt and Abby. - No we can't leave, we have to keep going. - It's Ok, you don't have to be tough all the time. -What about Mia and Olivia? -We can let the cops find them. - I just have this feeling we can't leave. We have to keep going. - I know but you felt this way all night and this place is really starting to mess with your head. We need to get you out of here. And I'm not taking no for an answer. -Ok. Lead the way. - Wait, wait, we need your help getting out of here. You're never getting out of here. -I found Bobby. I know you killed him. -I didn't kill anyone. -I killed everybody. -Stay back. - I'll kill you for what you did to Bobby. -We didn't kill anybody. My friends and I are just trapped in here. We need your help getting out. -(whispers) Abby! (whispers) Abby! (whispers) Abby! -Mia, you're Ok. Where have you been? Why are you in your underwear? What the fuck is going on? Whoa, Ok, I don't know what's going on with you but Abby's run off by herself and we need to go find her. -No we don't. -Something's wrong. -This isn't you. -I saw you. -You were dead. You killed my brother and now you want to kill me. -I don't want to kill you. -I'm gonna kill you. (screams) No! -What the fuck? (screams) Abby! Abby! Abby! -Guys? Where are you? Guys? Guys? Guys? Where are you? -Abby? Abby? - [Owen] I heard screams, they came from here. -Hey wait, don't walk too fast. -I won't leave you behind. -Matt! -Matt! What happened, where's Abby? -Matt, where's Abby? Why are your hands covered in blood? -Where's Abby Matt? -She's dead. -What? -She's dead. Abby's dead. -No, Jesus no. - Matt, what happened, what do you mean she's dead? - You're wrong, you can't be, you're wrong. -But I'm not, I'm so sorry Owen. -But, what happened? Why weren't you guys outside? -I don't know. - I don't know, we were trying to open the door and she thought she saw something down the hall and then she ran after it. -What do you mean? - We were at the door and the key, the key wasn't working and then Abby ran down the hall. She thought she heard something so she ran after it and I and I stayed to work on the door. -And? -She thought she saw someone. She thought it might be one of you two. -Matt, are you sure? Are you sure that Abby's dead? -Please Matt. -She's dead. Stabbed like 100 times. -I told you look out for her. -I know. I'm sorry. - You should have been outside safe. The both of you. -I know. We tried but the key wasn't working? And then Abby, she thought she heard something from down the hallway and she went out to go check and I should have stopped her, I'm sorry, I know. Owen, I'm sorry. -Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, the key wasn't working? -No. No, we both tried it. - Well how did you guys get down the hall if the sliding door was closed? -Sliding door? - The door has to be closed so the other can be open. It's a security door. -What? -You have to close the one door before the other can be open. I told you this Matt. -No you didn't. -Yes, I did, Matt! The key works perfectly fine. -Oh fuck! -Oh fuck! That's all you've got to say, you fucking idiot, you should be outside with Abby waiting for the cops. - Owen, I'm sorry but I swear to God, you never told me about closing that sliding door. -He's right Owen. I know you don't want to hear this right now but you never told Matt he had to close one door before he could unlock the other. -Matt, where's the key now? -I don't know. I think we left it in the door. -You don't know for sure? - Matt, that key is our only way out of this place you fucking idiot! -Why are you wearing his jacket? - I ripped my shirt and he just gave me... - Why were you two just holding hands? -What? -Are you fucking kidding me? You let Abby get stabbed to death and you think I'm hitting on your girlfriend? -Fuck you! It's your fault we're down here in the first place. It's your fucking fault! -Matt, back off! -Owen! -Abby's dead Jess. -I know. (screams) -Jess! Jess! -[Paulie] I found Bobby! He was a good kid. He didn't deserve to die like that. (screams) -Hey, no, no, no, no, no. -Mike, it happened again.
