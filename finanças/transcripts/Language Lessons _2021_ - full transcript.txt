Shh. Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. I don't speak any Spanish, so I have no idea what you're saying to me right now. Oh. Um, sorry. It says here you have good conversational Spanish, and you studied for four years in high school. Oh. No, no. No, sorry. That's Adam. And you are not Adam? No, no, no. I'm Will. So, Adam is my husband. I bought him the Spanish immersion lessons. Oh. OK. Um... I'm sorry, what... what's happening? Want that coffee! - Where are you? - OK, OK. Shh. He's coming. Shh, shh. Sorry, you're just gonna have to go with me on this. It's a surprise. Oh, you better make me one... - Sorry, what are you... - I want it. ♪ I want that coffee... ♪ ♪ Gonna drink it up... ♪ Um... I'm... I'm sorry, wha... who... who are you? What are you doing in my house? Oh. Um, hi. I... uh... Surprise! Mmm. OK, come on. Come on. Now that's... that's funny. No, not... not funny. No. That's funny! It's hilarious. I'm 45 years old. That's a h... this is a heart attack. - Can we just... - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Can we just stop the scare wars, please? You are such a drama queen. - I'm not mad. I won't... - No! You are so dead. Hey! Get off! Get off! You ain't gonna catch me. - OK... - Bye-bye. Have fun. - OK. - Come on. - Don't be a sore loser. - I'll just be here. The love of your life. - I love you. - Uh... uh yeah, I love you too. But you're dead. You're so... - Have fun! - ...just... Hi. Um... Sorry. Who are you again? Um... I'm your Spanish teacher. I'm just gonna get situated here. So... Will has bought a Spanish lesson for me, yeah? OK. And... How does this whole thing work, since we're, like, you know... this way? Oh. Um... I don't know if... if he told you, but I don't... I'm not fluent in Spanish. I'm... I'm not very... good, so... Do we... do we have to? OK. All right. So I have to speak Spanish - for one day... - Well... What? Um... he actually... he actually bought the, uh, the... the hundred-lesson package, so it... it's today, and then also, uh, 99 more weeks. Are you... Wow, that is... that's extreme. - Will? - Yeah? Did you buy me a hundred Spanish lessons? - Yeah! - Why? 'Cause you wanted to learn Spanish, dummy. Can I just be honest with you for a second? - Sure. - I, I am like, um... I'm an extreme creature of habit, and I have this morning routine that I normally do at this exact moment, and... it's kinda hard for me to adjust, and now... it's not just one lesson, it's, like, an... a hundred lessons, and I have to speak in Spanish the whole time, and I'm afraid that I'm gonna suck, and I'm just feeling very... No, that's not "muy," it's a... it's a basic word. But still, I... I don't know what to... I can't... I'm very overwhelmed. Look, why don't, um... I would be... I would be happy to be a part of your morning routine for the next two years. You mean like do... like do both? At the same time? Sure. How do you say "miss"? When you miss something? The mansplainer? No. Why are you laughing at me? Oh. Um... because, uh, you are insisting that you feel pregnant. What? Embarazado, well, I mean, embarazada means pregnant. Um... - It does? - Yeah. Well, if... you know, - it's the masculine version of... pregnant. But... - Oh, my God. I am so sorry. God. This is the worst Spanish lesson in history. You're so poor, and I'm pregnant. No. No. Really? Like what? Uh, affection. Um, care. Um... It stuck. In... in Dirty Dancing, how everybody just calls Baby "Baby." Ah. Cariño. If you'd... If you would like to reschedule, just, uh, let me know. I'm gonna hang out for a little bit longer, OK? OK. Oh. Did you understand what I said? Is everything OK? Did I talk too fast? Um... OK. OK. Eh... I'm... I'm... I'm so... I'm so sorry, Adam, I... - Yeah, it's OK, Adam. - I... Is there anybody... There with you? Is there... I'm gonna go scare him, and so I ran downstairs, I opened the door and... And they... told me that he, uh... I was his emergency contact in his phone, and that he'd been hit by a car and his head hit the ground and he died very quickly. And he... they took me, um, to identify him. And he was... it was him, but he was very smashed, and they gave me his phone. Which was not... had like one little crack in it, which I thought was so... OK, All right, I'm gonna... Um... I gotta tell everybody. My God, he's got so many friends. OK. This is gonna... OK. Maybe I should send the e-mail from here. If I... should I send it from me or should I send it from Will? 'Cause if they get it from Will, it's like they get an e-mail from... Um, I think that you should... Jesus, what is... Oh, my God. I don't know where any of this stuff is. I don't know what... I don't know how to... Like, he handles all the money stuff. Do I have to do this? - No. It's OK. - He has his... A whole dance company with employees. Is there, like, a payroll that I have to... You don't have to worry about that right now. It's OK. His n... his nephew. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. It's his nephew's birthday. And he's supposed to send him... he got this dog. He brought him this dog. I have to send this to his nephew, and I don't know... I don't even know where he lives. I don't know how to send... How do you send something this big? Oh, shit! Oh, shit, I can't do this. - Adam, it's OK. Adam. - I can't do this. I can't... I can't do any of this. - Adam. Adam. - I can't... - Adam, Adam, hey, hey. Hey! - I can't do this! Hey, it's OK, OK? It's OK, just... We'll get you help, OK? You don't have to worry about that right now, so just... just... Have you... have you gotten any sleep, or... OK. OK, just, um... Just... just focus on one thing. Just focus on me, and... I am gonna... I'm gonna... I'm just gonna do what I was gonna do, and I'm gonna show you some things, OK? So just... just stay here. Just... All right, let's see what we can see. Um, I think it's bamboo. I'm not much of a nature person, but I wanted to show you this little stream over here. Around this... Eh... I can hear this little stream at night... I'm gonna zoom in a little bit. I don't think I see anything. No, I think he might've... think he might've left. Is there a bug in here? You still with me, Adam? Hello, Adam. Um... it's Cariño. I just... I don't know why I introduced myself like you can't see me, like it's a voicemail. Um, I just wanted to say hello, and, um... see how you were doing. I was thinking about you this morning.... um, while I was in class with another student, and... I just want to make sure that you're OK. As OK as you can be. And I wanted to reiterate... I'm very, very sorry. I know that's not enough. I know that doesn't do anything. But I'm... I'm here if you need me. And if you... This has nothing to do with lessons, but if... I'm here if you want to continue them, or if you don't, or if you want to do them later. Just wanted to let you know I was thinking about you. Hope you're... Hope you're taking care. Hello, Adam. Thank you for getting back to me. I am... I'm glad to see you're still hanging in there. I wanted to offer you the only thing I can actually offer you, which is... In my experience, it... It helps to throw yourself into work and stay busy. So if you want some Spanish homework, I'm your girl. I can send you this little project that I do with a lot of my students. It's... it's kind of for kids, but it works on adults too. It's a... it's a little poem about the difference between ser and estar. And people have fun with it. But again, it's only if... you're looking for something to keep you busy. Um... Take care. Let me know how you're doing. Yeah. So, um... Hey, Adam. I just want to apologize. I'm so... Stupid. I'm so sorry that I... sent you homework. Who does that? I'm sorry. Please disregard me. Forever, please. Ugh. Mm. Estar is where you are. In a house or in a car. Or if you are happy or if you're sad. Estar can even tell you if you're mad. Ser is who you are, from the USA or... or from afar. I think some of you from Costa Rica out there. If you're skinny, fat, short, tall, ser describes you best of all. So if you want to be a star... which word would you use? Hey. Sorry you had to see that. I know that was absolutely ridiculous, but... I think that's the first time I can legitimately say that I had fun since, um... So... thanks. That was really... that was really stupid, but it was fun. OK. Bye. I'm glad you're feeling a little better. When you can. That's OK. I'm happy to see you not in your bed. I hope this video finds you in an even better state. OK? Speaking of which... OK, yes. Like a bread bun. Little ball of bread. "Can you pass the bread?" "Can you pass the pussy?" I'll see you Monday. Um... Really? OK. Not gonna show you that one. Oh. I haven't seen this one in a while. This is the night... Um, I was... I moved to Miami when I was eight. And I... I lived there for a long time. Oh. Oh, hi. Oh. Cariño, what happened? Oh, shit. Are you OK? Wait, hello? Are you still there? Yeah, sorry. I'm here. Uh... Hm. Sorry. What happened? No, no, no, what, what, what happened to you? Are you OK? I... No, I'm... I am fine. Sorry, um... I... I fell off my, uh, bike. Um, did you... I mean, did you go to the hospital? Did you get checked out? Is there anything I can do for you? Yeah, I'll get you a new bike. I'll have it sent to you, so just give me your address. - I'll... I'll... - I was... I was joking. I was kidding. I was just joking. I mean, oh, OK. I don't need you to buy me a bicycle, Adam. I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Are you... Are you still there? Are you... Do you mind if we reschedule? No, it's OK. It... it... Sure. OK, um, I hope you feel better. Yeah, I just wanted to say that. And, um... Hope you're having a good night. OK, uh, talk to you later. I would... I would appreciate the distraction, honestly. Um, so, uh... Yeah, um... That's all I want to say. OK. Uh, maybe I'll just do this one, uh, in English, make sure I get it right. Anyway, what I, um... What I wanted to say before but I was kind of afraid to say is, um, uh... My feeling is that your internet was fine. And, um... I think you just didn't want me to see your face. And, um... I'm not a genius, but I know that, uh, when... when you fall off of a bicycle, you usually really hurt your hands. And when you turned off your video, I saw your hands, and they were fine and they were not scraped up, and that is OK. Um... I don't know. I'm just... I'm worried about you, I-I guess, and I want you to know that I'm here. Um... I'm safe, if you want to talk to somebody. Uh... That's what I wanted to say. Uh... Cariño... Uh... Oh, good. How are you? I'm good. Um... It's... it's 2:30 in the morning. Is it? Over there? Sorry. Are you sleeping? No, no. I was just reading. I'm just... I was up, so... I, um, I found out that it was your birthday, so I thought that it would be very rude of me if I didn't, uh, wish you a happy birthday, so I thought I would play you "Happy Birthday." Ready? One, two, three. Here we go. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birth... ♪ No. ♪ Happy birthday, dear Adam ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday! I'm sorry I'm late. That was... No, it's OK. That was very beautiful. Um... How did you know it was my birthday? I looked... I looked on your... I saw it in your file. In my file? That was a total lie. I, um... I stalked your social media. - A little bit. - You went on my... I... OK. Just a little bit. You don't... I mean, there was not a lot to see. You don't really post anything. But I-I wanted to see if you were, like, um... a real, like, good and a true person that existed. Because I only ever see a box and then, like, a fancy house in the background. So, like, I don't know if you're real. And it turns out that you are, and that you, uh, you like shitty memes. That was a few years ago when there were more popular, but... God. Oh my God. - Uh, you know what? - What? Can you bring that piano over here and then we can play... I can teach you how to play "Happy Birthday" in Spanish. Um... OK. Is it OK if I just go to the piano? It's a little heavy. You're weak. OK. Look at all those fishes that you have. You have you have so many fishes. Yeah. Do-do they have names, or are they just fishes? Pickle, Bob, Harry, and Pickle Foot. - Pickle Foot? - Yeah. And then there's a skinny guy, this really, really skinny one with a long tail on him. We call him The Bride 'cause he's got this long train, like a... like a like a veil or a long-trimmed dress. OK, you ready? The chords are... - C. - OK. OK. And then G. Uh-huh. And then F. Very good. Hey, you know what? You're a really good music teacher. - Thank you! - I was gonna... I was going to take music lessons and get an-another teacher, but... How dare you. How dare you replace me... so quickly. I'm not replacing you. You're a Spanish teacher. This is a music teacher. But I could... I could also teach you music if you wanted to. I could... I... I could teach you a lot of things. I could teach you karate. Although, like, I don't know a lot about it, but, like, I do know how to kick someone. I could teach you some taxi stuff. - Taxi? - Yeah, I'm a really good... I mean, do you think that I'm a good... do you think that I'm a good Spanish teacher? Cariño, honestly, you're the best Spanish teacher I've ever had. Damn. That's great. Because guess what? What? I could also teach you the art of "deceivement" because I am not actually a Spanish teacher. What are you talking about? I have technically a certifica... a language certification, but it's in English. I'm an English teacher. And I learned, I have a degree for that that I got in the United States. And then I moved to Costa Rica, and I teach people English for free here. But then I teach dumb gringos Spanish, and I... and I charge them money, but I don't actually... I don't actually have a certification. I speak Spanish, obviously. You... you're a criminal. You're a criminal. No, it doesn't... on my website, it says "language certification." It doesn't specify which language. It's up to you to inquire, and no one ever does. - You're not certified? - Well, it's not like... I'm not teaching you bad on purpose. I'm trying. I'm not a bad person. I'm trying to teach you for real. OK, OK. Excuse me. I had to burp. - Cariño, my friend. - Yeah? That was so bad. We should do it again. You know why it was probably bad? Because, like, midway through, I realized that there was... there... um... that the song in Spanish is just translated from English, like the melody, and the song kind of, and then it just stops... it just gives up on wishing you a happy birthday midway through and just wishes you "birthday." Like I... in the middle of it, I was like, is this how this really goes? Because it just goes like "birthday to you," which seems like... fucked up! It's, uh... - I see your point. - Yeah, I mean, I guess... I guess some birthdays are just birthdays. You know? And they're not good, necessarily. Yes, my birthday... this birthday was... was not a happy birthday. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. Yeah, my, um, my mom died on her birthday, so that, that's a pretty shitty birthday, I think. Hmm, I'm sorry, I didn't know your mom passed away. That's OK. Ever... literally everyone dies, you know. Like... you know that. My grandma, my grandma also died. Babies die. Um, your husband died. That sucks. I, um... I think, I-I-I wished... I wished my husband died so many times after he divorced me. But I don't actually wish he was dead. I just don't... like, I don't care if he dies but I wish he had died. You know. Oh, is that? I'm so sorry. Was that so rude? No, I understand. It's OK. You're nice. I like... I like talking to you. You're always trying to get me to talk to you. And... it was a little suspect, at first. But then... I don't know, I guess you're just a nice person. Who knew those existed? Can I... can I tell you a secret? Yeah. It's really nice... to listen to you talk. Yeah? I like it. You do? Cariño! I gotta go. I'm sorry. Can you... Adam? - Adam. - Yes? - Adam! - Yes? Stop calling me so late. It's so unprofessional. Good night, Cariño. Bye! Hey, Adam. Um, I just wanted to apologize about last night. Um... I-I... I had some allergy meds, and I drank a beer... or two. And, uh, they didn't mix well, so sorry for calling you so late. Um, that being said, I... I have to postpone our classes for a little bit of time. I'll let you know as soon as I can get back to them. Hi, Adam. Um... Hi, Adam. Um... Sorry about last night. I didn't mean to call you so late. Um... I just wanted to, um... tell you that I'm not going to be able to make our class this Monday. Um... and I'll... I'm just dealing with some, like, uh, some... some personal stuff, and, um, I'll let you know when we can reschedule, OK? Fuck. Hey, Adam. Um... I was going to write you this in an email, but I thought... maybe that... would be... not so nice. Um, I'm sorry, but I-I have to cancel our classes for the time being. I shouldn't have called you so late last night... like that. And, um... I just have to deal with some personal stuff, so... I'm not even... I'm not even going to have a place to teach you from because I think I have to move soon, so, um... Why am I even telling you this? I don't owe you a fucking explanation. Adam? Are you OK? Look how well you taught me! Only had one lesson. Whoo! All right. That was my, uh... Are you OK? What... what's going on? It's not... um, it's not Monday. - I know. - Thought something was wrong. I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry. I just thought I was... I was making a joke 'cause you were so funny last night, and... - What is that face? - I was just... I was tired. OK. OK. Hey, look, I just want to say, I was not bothered by... you were very sweet and adorable. You were like this, like, free little spirit. It was, um... You shouldn't feel, like, weird about it. It was... It was, like, beautiful to see that side of you I hadn't seen, or had seen in little bits and pieces. So, OK, so... I'm sorry. I don't mean to... I'm worried about you. Why? Well... I mean... you told me a lot of things about your life, and you told me... about... how there's some, like, an ex-husband and you have these bruises on your face, and I don't know what your situation is, but... - What? - Uh-huh. OK. What... what's the... what's the narrative you've created? I don't have a narrative I've created because I don't... I'm an adorable little free spirit with a... with an abusive ex-husband. Is that it? I don't know because you won't share with me. I only have bits and pieces, but... Because you're not my friend, you're my student. I don't need to share anything with you except for some verbs in Spanish. If you want to be cruel, that's fine. But you're not gonna push me away because I see you, and I know exactly what you're doing 'cause I used to do the same damn thing to Will, and I know what it is, and you're not fooling me, OK? I am your friend, and you are my friend, and if some motherfucker is beating on you, I am going to do what I can to make sure that you are OK, and if that means buying you a plane ticket to get out of there, if that means buying you a house that you need to live in so that you can be safe... - Oh, my God. - I am going to do that. - Oh, my God. Wow. - "Oh, my God" what? Why? Why the sarcasm? What? You've watched... you've watched a lot of movies. This is some real white savior shit you got going on. Stop it with the fucking white shit! Stop it. I don't... it's not my problem that I have money. I don't feel... I'm trying to help you, OK, because you're my friend and I care for you. And you can put up this wall all you want, OK? But it's not going to work. If you are in trouble, I am going to help you because I love you, and I can't help that. OK? Now you... You love me. You know what I mean. I'm trying... That's so cute. You love me? You don't know the first thing about me, Adam. You don't know anything about me. You've just... You just made me up in your head to be this wonderful, beautiful, kind person. And I understand. Maybe... maybe you need that in your life because you... you lost someone like that, but you can't... I'm not a replacement for Will. I'm not trying to make you a replacement. I'm not a sweet, generous guy. These bruises... I don't have an abusive ex-husband. I haven't talked to my ex-husband in years. I got into a fight at a bar with some stupid girl. That's me. Is that what you want to know? Does that surprise you? Do you still love me? Fuck you. You don't know me. Stop assuming shit about me. Cariño... what is wrong with you? What is it? I promise, you can tell me. I found a lump... and it's getting bigger. OK. Have you had it checked out? No. Can I ask why not? Because what's the point, Adam? I know what's gonna happen. I've seen it happen. Your mom? Yes. And your grandmother? OK. I'm sorry. See, you don't need this. You don't need this. I... No, no, look. I... I'm happy that I was... there for you when Will died. But I wasn't... it wasn't what I signed up for. And I don't need a friend. And I don't need any more death in my life and... - neither do you, so... - OK, OK. Well, I'm just gonna say one thing. I'm here. I don't, um... I can't. I understand. I'll send you your money back, OK? OK. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, I hope you... No, I'm sorry. Adam, you don't need me. If you want to go, go ahead and sign off. I know how I feel. I'm not gonna tell you how you feel. Go ahead. Oh, shit. Hey, um, so I have been thinking a lot about our conversation, and, um... Look, I'm not gonna send you any more messages, OK? I respect your privacy. Um... but I do want to say what I didn't get the chance to say, 'cause, look, it was emotional, and I was pushy, and I didn't handle it well, and I'm sorry about that. But, um... The thing is... I would like you to come to Oakland. I would like you to stay with me. And, if you want to get your health in order, I would like to help you with that if you are willing to let me. And if that's not something you want to pursue, getting better, um... I would still like to help take care of you. Um... I sent you some money for a plane ticket, and that is not because I pity you, or because I'm trying to save you, or because I'm trying to assuage my white, you know, wealth guilt, which I, you know, have a lot of. Um... It's because I'm your friend, and because I now understand the value of a human life. Um... And look, selfishly, yes, I would like to spend time with you. I enjoy that, you know, um... I probably have become a little codependent, you know, I'm sure there was some... some Will-replacement stuff going on in there, but like, I don't know what's right or wrong at this stage of my life. If two people really need each other and lean on each other, is that such a horrible thing? You know? And I know you're not perfect. I... I understand that. People drink too much. They get in bar fights, you know. I always talk about how great Will is, but, like, he was an asshole to customer service representatives. You know, he was an art snob. He... He once broke up with a boyfriend 'cause the guy said Andrew Lloyd Webber was a genius. I don't know, I just... I had a dream the other night, and it was... the first dream I've had since Will died that he wasn't in. Um... But you were there, and... we were just hanging out in my backyard, and it was strange to, like, be together in person and, um... But it was great. And I really want you to come, and... And, if you don't want to, uh, and this is the end of our friendship, I understand. Um... I just want to say thank you for everything you have done for me, and for showing me that people can connect across time zones and languages and, um, in particular, for showing me that... I'm gonna be able to care very deeply for someone else after Will, and I'm gonna be OK. And for that I will, um... I will always be grateful to you. Um... Yeah, I don't feel like speaking Spanish. Um... I know I said I wasn't gonna send you any more messages, um, but... I don't... I don't know. I'm just used to it. You know, I'm used to us. And I don't really know what to do. Um, so... Here's a message, you know, I'm... I miss you. I'm... I'm sorry if I offended you. I didn't mean to, and I understand... if you don't... I shouldn't even s... I don't even... I don't even know what to... I don't know what to say. I thought we were real friends. I really felt that, and I thought that we were connected in, like, the spirit, and in... in the heart and I... Maybe it wasn't the same for you, and... I don't know what I'm saying. It doesn't matter. I'm not gonna bother you anymore. I won't... Hi. I'm here. I look short? Kind of. I don't know, I just thought you were... Oh, man! Thank you. It is a big house. I'll teach you. Don't worry. All right, don't need this.
