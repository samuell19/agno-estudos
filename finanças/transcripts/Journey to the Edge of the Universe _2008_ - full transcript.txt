The night sky, We look up and think, What's up there? Where does? When did you start? We could stay forever, wondering ... ... or we can prepare us to see the universe for ourselves, and travel as far as you can go. To feel the tremendous heat of burning stars, face the forces of strong cosmic collisions. avoid dead stars and super-hole mass insatiable black. Witness the birth of new stars, and to the limit of human comprehension. We have to take a trip back in time to the early universe, see with their own eyes, the moment when it all started, o Big Bang. You are soon? So let's go, a journey to the limits of the universe. TO TRAVEL LIMITS OF THE UNIVERSE This is the beginning of space, only 100 km above, just an hour drive from home. Down there, life goes on , traffic continues to walk, shares are traded and continue to be transmitted the same reality shows . But we have to leave it all behind and move to the limit of the universe. First stop, to take. Twenty-seven American astronauts made this way before us, twelve of which they walked on the Moon itself. When the Apollo astronauts sent a message via radio, the message about took a second to reach Earth, even traveling at the speed of light, 300,000 kilometers per second. So Mission Control heard him what was going on after it happened. If there is a second difference between us and the nearest neighbor, imagine the difference up to the Universe limit. We do not turn back a few seconds, but billions of years. Less than 400 000 kilometers from Earth, three days in a spacecraft. It looks like a desert battlefield, bombarded by millions of meteroritos and asteroids. But now it's quiet. Of course, there are no major collisions for millions of years. The Apollo 11 lunar module. For astronauts Appolo, the risks were high, but the rewards were still higher. See our planet, as had never been seen, walk where no man had walked before and visit another world, a world destroyed by the deadly radiation from the sun. It's just endless frozen lava, piles of gray rocks uninteresting. Apollo astronauts brought hundreds of them for scientists to analyze, and found that these gray rocks uninteresting after all they were not so uninteresting. NASA scientists discovered that the rocks were super-heated, evidence of a massive impact. There are 4.5 billion years ago, a wandering planet crashed into Earth, and projected billions of tons of molten rock into space. And that joined to form the Moon. Until this discovery, We thought that the moon does not was related to the Earth, a space rock controlled by the powerful force of Earth's gravity. Now we know that is made of the same material as our planet. To take He came from Earth. The first steps of Neil Armstrong, It seems to have been made yesterday. And no wind here to make them disappear, shall survive for millions of years. It is time for us to take our giant leap, further than any man has ever traveled. Out of the darkness, the goddess of love, Venus. The morning star, the evening star. Venus is the planet of the system brighter Solar. Its spectacular yellow clouds reflect the light the sun. A sister of our planet. It has more or less the same size and the same Earth's gravity. More spacecraft to Venus tells us that these views clouds are made of deadly sulfuric acid, that the planet's atmosphere It is blocked by carbon dioxide. Venus is a goddess angry. The air is harmful, intolerable pressure and it is hot, approximately 500 degrees Celsius. Staying too long, we would be corroded, suffocated, crushed and boiled. Nothing can survive here. Like this. It is the unmanned Soviet probe Venera. Their heavy armor is being eroded by the extreme atmosphere. So beautiful Earth, close up view of Venus is the sister of Hell, marked by hundreds of volcanoes. All that carbon dioxide in its atmosphere is to retain the sun's heat. This is global warming taken to the extreme. Before that, maybe Venus was calm, as the sister planet Earth. If it's true, this may be the future of our planet. A future shaped by the sun. But before we get to it, We have it, Mercury, the smallest planet in the Solar System. Approaching the sun too, and this is what happens. Temperatures here vary wildly, night are 170 degrees below zero, by noon, 400 are positive. Burned, ice cream, and covered with scars, it seems that Mercury had a violent past. A sonda espacial Messenger It is telling us something strange. For its size, this small planet has a powerful gravitational pull. It must be heavier than it looks. It's like a huge ball of iron covered by a thin layer of rock, the core of what once was a much larger planet. So where's the rest of it? Perhaps a wandering planet has shocked Mercury, launching into space of its outer layers, leaving the planet almost entirely made of metal. The sun, in all its splendor mesmerizing. Everything we do, is controlled by the sun. All our lives depend on it. Throughout history, across cultures, is the axis around which life revolves on Earth, maturing our crops, structuring our day, inspiring our beliefs. 150 million kilometers from home, a trip 20 years by plane, turning it off, so far away, not we would know for eight minutes. It's so big, it could contain a million Earths inside. so heavy, that its gravity controls the entire solar system. We see it every day, a familiar face in our sky. Closely, It is unrecognizable. A turbulent sea of incandescent gas. The thermometer rises above 5000 degrees. Below the core, should be tens of millions of degrees. Hot enough to trigger nuclear reactions, transforming million tons of matter into energy, every second, more than all the energy ever produced by mankind. My home we see this energy as light, and feel it as heat. But up close, there is nothing reassuring about the sun. It is so full of activity Electrical and magnetic, exploding these huge and incandescent gas ties, called prominences, each of which releasing more energy than 10 million volcanoes. We could spend the earth by one of these ties and still we would be tens of kilometers to spare thousands. And when burst, exposing the colder lower layers, causing sunspots. They are more fraction cooler than the surroundings, this is why look black, but still warmer than anything on earth. They are also massive, some of them at least 50,000 kilometers in diameter, enough to swallow the Earth. A solar flare, a super hot gas flow electrified, spreading deadly radiation through space. But one day Sun fuel it will end. Die. When I die, will reap life on Earth. The sun creates life and destroy it. It requires us to maintain distance. It comet He approached a lot. It is to be evaporated by heat from the sun, creating a tail extending millions of kilometers. It's freezing here. There is no doubt where this comet came, ice wastes of deep space. Steam, geysers and dust, is the sun again, melting the cold heart of the comet. It's kind of a big dirty snowball, tar covered. Small grains of what seems organic material, preserved in the ice since, God knows since when, perhaps from the early solar system. If a comet like this if you have crashed on the young Earth billions of years ago, it can be brought organic material and water, the basic ingredients of life. And it may have sown the seeds of life on Earth which evolved to you and to me. But collide with the Earth now, only has to think of dinosaurs, extinct by a comet or asteroid that crashed 65 million years, to realize, it would not be good news. It's only a matter of time. Eventually, one day, unless we find a way to protect, we will face the same fate as the dinosaurs. The Earth is safe ... ...for now. But if life on Earth is threatened, we need to get away and find a new home. Among the millions, billions of planets, there must be one that does not is too hot, not too cold, air, sunlight, Water. The Red Planet, inconfundivelmente, Mars. For centuries, we look at Mars looking for company, for signs of life. It sounds like science fiction, but today the astronomers think that Mars can be the best chance of finding extraterrestrial life. Observe the planet, digitalizam-not, study it. More than any other planet, Mars holds our imagination. Think of science fiction movies, comics, and will think of Martians. It's all just fiction, right? But what if there really is something here? If it exists, You are living on a dead planet. The processes that make Earth habitable, They stopped hundreds of millions of years here. Red... ... and dead, ... Mars is a giant fossil. But there is wind here, a whirlpool, a big one, larger than the largest tornados on Earth. And where there is wind, no air, air that can sustain extraterrestrial life. But it is too thin to be breathable, filled with carbon dioxide suffocating. There is nothing to protect Mars from the sun's ultraviolet rays, and it is cold, as low as 80 degrees below zero, freezing the water in the soil, the poles and up in the atmosphere. Neve. It is hard to believe that something can live here. Back on Earth, there are creatures that survive the extreme cold, hot, even in the deep , dark sea crevices. Even in the most extreme conditions, life ... ... usually finds a way. But here, on Mars, no geological activity to replenish minerals and nutrients in the soil, no heat to melt its frozen water, and all this dust, It is hard to see how. But the surface of Mars It is marked with remarkable features. So big, it is impossible not to notice, Mount Olympus, an ancient volcano vast, three times higher than Everest. There are signs of activity. Since its discovery in the 70s, It was declared extinct. Any lava flow must have termindo long, destroyed by meteorite impacts. Unless, this monster is not dead after all. If not, there may be magma flowing beneath the crust right now. Volcanic activity can melt ice in the soil, where life could survive. This makes the Grand Canyon look like one rachadela on the pavement. There is no end. It is so long, that would extend throughout America. And there are signs of erosion, dry riverbeds, as volcanic activity has melted water in the soil, sending water through this gap. And if there is water running on Mars right now, so no chance of finding life here. So the hunt is launched. Wandering through this desolate landscape, or robot da NASA Opportunity. Looking for evidence that these barren plains are ancient lakes or oceans, that could have supported life. And look at this. When the orbiting Mars probes pass over these ravines, continue to find new ones. More evidence that Mars may be very much alive, that there may be liquid water beneath its surface, yielding these gullies Water that can sustain life on Mars. Now all we have to do, It is to find it. But perhaps already we have found, because, incredibly, Mars may have been the place where the life of the Earth has had origin. It seems crazy, but there is a theory that life began here, before moving to Earth. The idea is that an asteroid crashed, releasing fragments of Mars with tiny microbes to space, and the young Earth, which sowed the seeds of life itself. No wonder we consider Mars fascinating, It could be our ancestral home. If it's true, this means that we are all Martians. thought it was a dead planet, but may be more alive than ever imagined. Mars, possibly the planet in the solar system most studied, continues to baffle us. So what other surprises will be out there, waiting to be discovered? This It is like being inside a game giant computer. asteroids, some with hundreds of kilometers in diameter. This should be about 30 kilometers long. And look, It must not have been easy to land a probe on a asteroid traveling at 8000 kilometers per hour. It's too much effort to study rock debris, rocks collide, depart, and fall to Earth as meteorites. Were rocks like those that joined to form the planets, including ours. Thus, dating the meteorites we find on Earth, we know that the planets were born 4.5 billion years ago. These are the certificates of birth of the solar system. But for some reason, these rocks have not joined a planet. Something must have stopped him, something powerful. Jupiter, that monster, at least 1 000 times greater than the earth. So great that if they could get all the other planets within it. Something so big should have a large effect on its neighbors. Its gravity is preventing the asteroids to form a planet. But this huge planet is almost all gas. Landing here, and we would sink through its layers, probably never finding solid surface. And the beautiful aspect of Jupiter, It is the product of extreme violence. It is spinning at an incredible speed, causing winds of hundreds of kilometers per hour, contorting the clouds into stripes, swirls, whirls. This is it, the legendary Great Red Spot, the largest and most violent storm in the solar system, at least three times the size of Earth, It is roaring for more than 300 years. All these choppy clouds should trigger an electrical storm. Lightning is only 10 000 times more intense than any at home. It seems that the best place, the safest place to see Jupiter, It is away. Look at those lights, Auroras appear at home, dancing around the poles. But even these are deadly. Are generated by radiation attracted lethal space by powerful field magnetic Jupiter. Seductive distance, terrifying closely, on here... ...nothing is what it seems like. The universe is full of contradictions. We must proceed with caution, among the 62 or more Jupiter moons. Contact Esta multicolored chama-if I do. But as Jupiter, your beauty, It is only superficial. These beautiful colors, They are molten rock, sulfur, volcanoes, spewing hot ash sulfur hundreds of kilometers into the air. The strong gravitational force Jupiter is to twist and stretch Io creating enough friction to melt the interior of this moon. On our trip to the Universe limit, we do not find life, no place that we can call home ... ...so far. But there is always another planet, moon, another world of possibilities, just above the horizon. How is it going, Europe is, another of Jupiter's moons. 650 million kilometers from home, that place with strange aspect. And yet it seems strangely familiar, a bit like the Arctic, with all that ice, all those ridges and faults. And maybe, like the Arctic, this ice is floating in water, liquid water. It's a fascinating possibility, but the 800 million kilometers from the Sun, Europe should be solid ice. Unless Jupiter gravity is creating friction deep inside, preventing Europe from freezing, allowing life to develop in the downstream of the frozen crust. We may be a few meters from aliens, a full microsystem of microbes, crustaceans, even squid. The only thing between us and the possibility of extraterrestrial life, This ice layer. But until we send a ship space drill the ice, Europe will remain one of the greatest mysteries of the solar system. It has captivated our imagination, haunted our dreams, and here it is, turning before our eyes, Saturn, the jewel in the crown of the solar system. There is something magical about Saturn, a giant ball of gas, so light that float in water. Your spectacular, rings extended arrive almost from Earth to the moon. But they have only a few hundred centimeters thick. A Cassini It is to catch emissions spectral radio, probably generated by auroras around Saturn's poles. This is the real music of the spheres. And you're telling us that these rings are almost certainly the remains of a moon shattered by the force of Saturn gravity. incomparable beauty from complete destruction. Billions of ice pieces, some smaller than ice cubes, other houses in size. They collide, break off, join again, It is like a photograph of our young solar system, with dust and gas orbiting the newborn sun, and gravity to do its magic, picking up the pieces, until waste like these, our planet arose. All objects orbiting Saturn, They are technically moons, from the smallest chunk of ice to it, greater than our moon, Titan. Is shrouded by clouds thick orange, But underneath them, there seems to be an atmosphere here. There is wind, rain, even stations. And rivers, lagos, and oceans. It is the place more like the Earth that we have seen so far, except is not water, is liquid natural gas. There must be hundreds of times more natural gas here than in all the reserves of oil and gas on Earth. If we took home, he could feed our cities, fuel our cars for thousands of years, or perhaps one day, we can use it here ... ... to supply a colony, assuming that not there is life on Titan. A space probe Huygens, dropped on the surface of Titan by Cassini, You are here to find out. You are telling us that there are organic materials in the soil, but it's so cold, 180 degrees Celsius, there is no way to join to give life. Unless, Titan heat. It is anticipated that the sun becomes hotter. When this happens, perhaps life to flourish here, as it happened on Earth billions of years ago. And as the Earth will become too hot for us, perhaps us to move to Titan. One day, maybe we can call this distant moon, house. House, we are at least a billion kilometers away now. Beyond this point, We lost visual contact with the earth. And whatever there is here, is Earth invisible to the naked eye. We are in the mysterious outer reaches of the solar system, territory that, for most of history, no one knew existed. It's like diving into the deep ocean. Uranus, with these odd rings only discovered in 1977, that make this giant planet appears to have been moved from its axis, pushed by an ancient collision, perhaps for a lost planet. It seems to be far from home, but the truth is that, still poorly we left the coast. We are 2 billion kilometers from Earth, but to reach the solar system boundary, we will have to travel 10 000 times further. Coming out of the deep darkness, another strange beast, the god of the sea, Neptuno. It seems serene, but this point is an Earth - sized storm, shaken by wild winds of 1500 kilometers per hour. On Earth, it is the Sun that drives the wind, but Neptune is too far. Something else must be to generate these ferocious winds, but no one knows what. Advancing the limits outside the solar system, orbiting the gas giant, a solid moon, Merman. It is solid, but far from stable. Is covered with geysers, cosmic smokestacks, spewing out strange soot, Neptune and is orbiting in the direction opposite the rotation of the planet. A cosmic battle of wills, but this angry moon, will inevitably lose. It has been locked, Gravity mass wound by Neptune. One day, Triton, It will be torn apart. We saw all the planets in our solar system. But beyond the planets, It is not empty. It's full of frozen rocks, Ice balls, as Pluto. Until recently, it seemed that Pluto was alone, that there was nothing here. We were wrong. More frozen worlds. The discovery is so recent, no one agrees on what to call them, plutoids, ice dwarfs, cubewanos . It seems that our solar system is not organized model we thought it was. It's full of trash with the rest of your creation. Beyond 13 billion kilometers from home, the furthest thing ever seen orbiting the sun. Another small frozen world, called Sedna , discovered in 2003. Its orbit takes 10,000 years and dista 130 billion kilometers from the sun. There is something else here. The 16 billion kilometers from home, a space probe Voyager One. If it were not for her, we would not have images of the giant planets, no clue about its strange moons. Is traveling 20 times faster than a bullet, sending messages to home. That gold panel, It is a kind of message intergalactic a bottle. It contains a recorded greeting in 55 languages, and a map showing how to find our solar system. But we will want to really advertise our existence? Anyone, anything, can hear our chamamamento, find out where we live, come and knock on the door ... ... amicably or not. To follow, a cloud of cosmic icebergs, blocks of frozen water, dust and gas, as the comet seen before. Were comets that may have planted the sementas of life on Earth billions of years ago. And if they came here, seeing all this ice, They may have also brought water to Earth. The water in the oceans, in your coffee, even in your body, all this distant celestial ice machine. We are 8 trillion, ie eight trillion house of kilometers, right on the edge of our solar system, where no man, no probe had come before. Welcome to the interstellar space, far beyond our solar system. Billions of stars like our Sun, many with planets, many of which have moons. endless possibilities in all directions. Whatever the choice, we need a power very large acceleration. 40 trillion kilometers from home, a trip 150 000 years a space shuttle, and still only reached the first solar system after ours, Alpha Centauri. A star and two, rotating around each other, trapped in a celestial standoff, the severity of each star attracting other, its dizzying orbital speed, keeping them separate. We are now so far from home, that kilometers lose their meaning. We will have to speak in light years. A ray of light takes 1 year to go 10 trillion kilometers. Thus, 40 trillion kilometers, is 4 light years from home. It's amazing, distances so vast that are almost beyond comprehension. It's exciting, who knows what strange worlds lie ahead. 10 years light of Earth, the star Epsilon Eridani . spectacular rings of dust and ice, and sometime there -planets are formed from fragments, being born before our eyes. Asteroids and comets everywhere. We could almost be looking for our solar system, billions of years ago, comets with the molecules to be delivered organic water to these young planets, triggering life as may have done on Earth. At the center of all the action, a smaller star than our sun. It is still in its infancy, Any life in this solar system, would be, at best, primitive. There should be here solar systems more mature and more developed, Find more-the It is like looking for a needle in a cosmic haystack. We are now 20 light years from Earth. The star Gliese 581 . Has more or less the same age as our Sun, and orbit-a, this planet. Is the right distance from its sun, nearest and boil water, further and freeze. Ideal conditions for life to have evolved. And if comets have crashed, delivering water and organic materials, then life, complex beings like us, even civilizations like ours can exist there at this time. If any, even at this distance, They can pick up our TV signals, see programs broadcast from Earth 20 years ago. But to future generations discover how to communicate through such great distances, all we can do is speculate. In fact, life may have already prospered here only to be annihilated. It is the problem with comets, are creators and destroyers, like dinosaurs discovered the hard way. This is the outer needle in a haystack, the closest we get a solar system habitable like ours. But it was a casual finding. There may be hundreds, millions, more solar systems like this here or absolutely none. This is great, and look some of its atmosphere is being boiled for its next star. It is the planet Bellerophon , the first planet discovered outside our solar system in 1995. The problem is that, Earth, it is difficult to identify obscured by the glare of its nearby star. But he has little effect gravity on its star. Measuring these small movements, the trillions of kilometers away, one can prove that this planet exists. That 's how we track Bellerophon , and opened the door to the discovery of hundreds of other distant planets. The farther we go, further back in time on our trip. We are 65 light-years from Earth, connecting a TV in this shining star, catch would the TV signal of the Olympic Games of 1936 Hitler in Berlin. twin stars, is Algol , the Demon Star, feared since ancient times. Earth looks like a star that flashes on and off, but close to, we can see that, in fact, are two stars and that is being sucked by the other. Almost 100 light-years from home, listen one of the first radio broadcasts, only faint whispers. And then silence. From now on, it's as if the earth had never existed. Any aliens who live beyond here, They will not make any idea that we are there. And the farther we travel, less familiar, more dangerous it becomes the universe. Well within our galaxy, the Milky Way, an immense celestial bookstore. Each star is a book with a story to tell. The Seven Sisters, transformed into stars in ancient Greek mythology. And this giant, Betelgeuse, the brightest and biggest star we've seen so far, at least 600 times larger than our sun. But this ... ... it is not a star, It is not a planet, nothing like anything we've seen. Um spectrum spooky, over 1 300 light-years from Earth, the Black Cloud Orion . Dust and gas, so dense that it is blocking the universe forward. And right inside, a ball of light pulling the dust and gas for you, heating, merging a ball burning hot gas, Like a star, like our Sun, miniature. Within the temperature reaches millions of degrees. So hot, You begin to trigger nuclear reactions, the kind that keep our sun shining, producing energy, radiation, light. A star... ... is born. Or better, stars. The Black Cloud Orion is a huge star factory. We came here expecting horrors. Instead, We discovered one of the greatest wonders of the universe, the birth of stars. We are witnessing the birth of the Universe future gas jets, Exploding 200 000. kilometers per hour, releasing dust and gas million kilometers. It's incredibly violent, but look at the results. nebulas, huge bright clouds of gas, suspended in space. No wind here, They take thousands of years to disperse. This nebula is so vast that it would take a quarter of a million years, only to go around in a spaceship. But its vast expanse is overshadowed by a strange way, It looks like a giant head of a horse, prancing in space. Stars are born, grow and then ... ...after what? die, silently fall asleep at night, or end up in an explosion? What happens next, happen to our sun, their fate lies here somewhere. Nearly 4 000 light years later, luminous clouds suspended in space, turning around what was once a star like our sun. All that remains of it, are these colorful gases, elements formed by fusion nuclear well inside the star, released into space in his death. Green and violet, hydrogen and helium, the raw material of the universe. Red and blue, nitrogen and oxygen, the building blocks of life on Earth. To live, stars like this had to die. The oxygen in our lungs, nitrogen in our DNA was all produced by nuclear fusion in stars that died long before the earth have even born. we are made Star of nuclear waste. In your heart, the ghost of a star. It is a white dwarf, white and incredibly hot, small, but incredibly dense. In the final moments of the stars, atoms are melted and squeezed against each other, making it so dense that just a teaspoon this white dwarf would weigh a ton. It is a frightening premonition of the fate of our sun. In a 6 billion years, to become a white dwarf. His death, announce the end of life on Earth. This makes you think how many worlds have existed and gone, stories were untold, heavenly books lost forever. But most of all stories It has not yet been told. We must return in time to the true first chapter, to tell the story how the universe began. This are the scattered remains of the death of a star, a nebula, the Crab Nebula. We are 6 000 light years from home, well within a star cemetery. Dust and gas, extending kilometers per trillion. It looks dead, but perhaps this is just the calm after the storm. After a massive explosion, powerful enough to transform a huge star a cloud of dust and gas, one Supernova. The eye of the storm, a pulsating star spinning, a pulsar. The gravity squeezed the giant star 's core that. It has only about 20 kilometers in diameter, making it impossibly dense. A pinhead of this would weigh hundreds, perhaps millions, of tons. While decreases, as a skater spinning on ice with outstretched arms and then shrinking them, he starts running faster. Two light beams, energy, radiation, turning thirty times per second, feeding the huge cloud of dust and gas. There is so much radiation here, even more than our sun. If this pulse approaching the Earth and our Sun, our planet would be instantly stripped of life. That was by far the most thing deadly we have met ... ...so far. It's the only thing we wanted to find. Impossibly black, blotting out the stars behind it, we are looking at the face of death, the remains of a giant star, a black hole. Instead of getting a white dwarf, or a pulsar just continued ... ... shrinking, until so small, only a few kilometers across. Much denser than a pulsar, and impossible to resist him. Walking too close, there is no return. Now we know why it is a black hole. Its gravity is so intense. that even light can not escape. This asteroid, a piece of rock sound is being stretched, to be drawn into the open hole. Within the field does not exist as we know, there is no time, no space. All the laws of physics collapse. The asteroid disappeared. The truth is that nobody really knows where. We are looking at the limits of scientific knowledge. There may be millions of black holes, crawling around our galaxy, perhaps more than all the stars in the sky. But not we would see ... ... until it was too late, as this star, spiraling down to an invisible black hole. Who can say that we do not live in a huge black hole, the whole universe not is tucked inside a this time, in another universe? Sometimes it seems that the more we see, least we know. But we know that our galaxy is more complex and more dangerous than ever imagined. And we are still in our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The rest of the universe is still ahead. The wonders, the dangers, the secrets, They are out there. But first, we have to find a way out of the Milky Way. We are now 7000 years light-house, well within our galaxy, traveling to the Universe limit. We still have to travel many millions of light years, but there is plenty to see along the way. A colossal glowing cloud, topped by the two towers of dust, the Pillars of Creation. As a gateway to a distant galaxy, both pillars are studded with tiny bumps, embryonic solar systems, each of which the size of our solar system. It is another monument to the astonishing creativity of nature, but not permanent. The radiation from neighboring hot stars is to destroy it. In just a few million years This immense nebula It will be gone. Blink of an eye in astronomical terms. Dazzled by the beauty of the Milky Way, we enter into a cosmic minefield. Giant clouds of gas this exploding star, a star millions of times brighter than our sun. The nuclear reactions that supported are decreasing. We are watching the agony of death. Eventually, implode the core. The result, a new black hole. An even greater, even more dangerously unstable star, but this is about to explode. And when such a large star dies, is hundreds of times more violent than a supernova. Somehow stumbled into death more violent imaginable of a star, one hypernova. The core collapsed, It has become a black hole. And this is the shock wave, Star coming expelling its layers exterior to space. There are deadly radiation everywhere, enough to have a catastrophic effect on any planet sucientemente unlucky to be around. When virtually all species on Earth It was extinguished there are 450 million years, the culprit may have been one of these. Deadly hypernovae, frozen comets, burned planets, white dwarfs, red giants, Terra, small drops in a vast pool of white light, our galaxy, the Milky Way. We wanted to know where we fit. Here is the answer. Civilizations past and present, all who have ever lived, the smallest insect, the highest mountain, all this invisible, even a tiny spot. Our house, It is a minor planet an insignificant star. If he disappeared at this time, no one would notice. And yet, so far we have not found any other place where you would prefer to live, no place where we could live. But look at all these stars, hundreds, thousands of them. Surely one of these, more than one, must be able to support life. Perhaps here, this star cluster, Grand Group. Stepping back to the 70s, astronomers sent a message in this direction, detailing the structure of our DNA and showing a plane of our solar system. But it's so far from home, the message will not arrive before at least another 25,000 years. We did not find extraterrestrial life, yet, but we did not find any reason to believe that does not exist here ... ...somewhere. There is an equation designed to estimate the number of other advanced civilizations. And the results are shocking. There may be millions of civilizations, just in our galaxy. Everything we have seen so far, It belongs to the Milky Way. Now is our chance to see other galaxies, to envision an even bigger picture, and perhaps answer the ultimate question, whence came all this. It's time to leave our solar system, our galaxy, to travel beyond the Milky Way, through the vast distances between galaxies, not coming intergalactic space. Here outside, there is no horizon in sight. Even the closest galaxies are hundreds of thousands of light-years. The remains of galaxies undone by the immense force of gravity of the Milky Way, scattered ... ...any. This is the closest that the universe has a perfect vacuum. But even this is not completely empty. There are thin strands gas, fine traces of dust, and something else, dark matter. So mysterious, not to see, feel it, touch it, or even measure it. Yet so common, which may represent 90% of all matter in the universe. If dark matter exists, this means that there is no such thing as empty space. Even out here, we are surrounded by matter. Only we suspect that there is, because of the strange attraction that seems to play in galaxies, as this, the Large Magellanic Cloud. Over 6 billion years the most rapid spacecraft of today, 160 000 light-years from the Milky Way, within their gravitational reach. This galaxy should rotate in space, but something seems to be holding her here, something invisible, powerful, dark matter. star star clusters, nebulae, It is an immense home of astronomical treasures. A fireball, expanding from what should have been a massive explosion, one Supernova. So bright that when light from the explosion reached Earth in 1987, It was visible to the naked eye. And so violent, that triggered a chain of nuclear reactions, forcing the atoms to unite, creating new elements, gold, talk, platinum, ejecting them into space. The gold ring on your finger, It was forged in a supernova massive as this, the trillions of kilometers away, billions of years ago. It is an astonishing thought, the stars that seem so distant from Earth, affect our lives directly. It is comforting to remember, as we venture further across the chasm. The Andromeda galaxy, 2.5 million light years, is moving in space almost one million kilometers per hour. Everything in space is to move away, as shrapnel in an explosion. We are seeing this galaxy as it was when our primates ancestors took the first steps on the African plains. Go further in space, and further back in time, to find an entire galaxy to explode. The only thing big enough to cause an explosion of this scale, It must be a collision with another galaxy. But this galaxy will not die, reborn, a new form, perhaps even new stars, as dust and gas collide, creating friction, shock waves, triggering the birth of even more stars. There is order in this chaos, a pattern behind the endless variety, an endless cycle of births and deaths, from creation and destruction. It is a standard fabric in the vast factory space, linking each of these galaxies. There are billions of galaxies in the universe, each with billions, even trillions of stars, possibly, more stars than there are grains of sand on all the beaches of Earth. And all this, They are just the stars that exist now. And the stars that ever existed and disappeared? All the stars have been born, unborn, finally begin to see the big picture, and it is greater than ever imagined. This galaxy, the immense galaxy Cata-Vento, It is so far from Earth that we sent one message home now, it would take 27 million years to get there. Who knows if our species, our planet, still they are there to receive it. We are traveling back in time. We passed the point where the dinosaurs went extinct, We spent the time that the first creatures crept ashore. 2 billion light-years from home, to approach the Universe limit, retreating to the beginning of time. This is not a galaxy, It is brighter than hundreds of galaxies together. A blinding beam of energy spanning trillion kilometers. Something so big, so bright, It must be incredibly powerful. Experience tells us that here, power equals danger. It is a quasar, the deadliest and most powerful thing in the universe. A rotary pot of super-heated gas, brighter than hundreds of galaxies. The source of this immense power, lies deep in the heart of the beast, a heart of darkness, a super massive black hole, as heavy as billions of suns. Is ripping entire stars, sucking its gases to the quasar, devouring them, until they are nothing, lost forever the visible universe. We have seen the worst the universe in can cause, their most powerful destructive forces. Now, our path is clear. The real limit of the Universe is almost within reach. But we still need to go further, faster, to cross the ends end of the universe. 8 billion light years from home, most galaxies, but they look different, tattered, small, close together. We step back in both time we are seeing these galaxies as they were before the Earth even have been born. They are still new, They are still growing. Estamo us closer to where and how everything started, for 12 billion years. Look at the galaxies now, They seem more primitive plankton, floating in a vast, dark ocean. It's magic, dust and gas clouds, dancing, assuming manner, merging to create embryonic galaxies. Thus it was born our galaxy, but now they are disappearing. Step back to a time before the birth of stars, in an era of cosmic darkness. And before that, light, the twilight of a massive explosion, the explosion that created the universe, We are almost there, this is it, managed, the universe of the limit, 130 trillion trillion house of kilometers, there are 13.5 billion years, the exact moment of the Big Bang, the most violent, the most creative moment in history. All that happened was triggered at the moment. All religions, all cultures have thought of it, but we do not know what triggered this act of creation, or why. This is where our journey ends, and the Universe begins. An infinitely hot, small, dense point erupts, creating the space, time, matter, our Universe itself. First is the size of a subatomic particle, a very small fraction of a second later, It is large enough to be held in the palm of your hand. Moments later, It is the size of Earth. Today, the light of the Big Bang still continues to spread as a radio static hiss. TV antenna picks it up, You can see it as still an untuned television. we continue, forward in time. All the things we saw on our trip, Sparks are flying from the Big Bang. galaxies, stars, planets, everything just remains. Back in our galaxy, our Solar System, until we get the other ashes cooled, running at dusk Big Bang, the land, Our house. But the story does not end here. The effects of the Big Bang continue to engage us. The universe continues to change. In a 3 billion years, the vast Andromeda galaxy will smash against our, creating a new galaxy. The Sun and the planets survive, but they will be released in a huge circular orbit around the new galaxy. The sun will become a red giant to, swallowing Mercury and Venus, burning the surface of our planet, destroying all life on Earth. Then die, contracting a white dwarf. The nearby stars also die replaced by white dwarfs, pulsars, black holes. The lights will go off in the galaxy. Since the Big Bang, the universe is disappearing, to die, not with a bang, but with a long drawn breath. But there may be a way out, a route of escape from our Universe dying. Is likely to be possible for our distant descendants find a shortcut through space and time, a worm hole. If there are other universes, could lead our descendants of a doomed universe to another parallel, where you can find a new earth, still in the prime of life. If they are lucky enough, they will live in a new universe, a new planet, a new home. Subtitles and synchronization CASIMIR GOMES
