First class degree Member of German Socialist Students' Association Member of Red Army Faction from 1970 Arrested 1972 in Frankfurt STAMMHEIM The Trial of the Baader-Meinhof Group Original Music by Marcel Wengler producers: Jürgen Flimm and Eberhard Junkersdorf Director: Reinhard Hauff The Baader-Meinhof trial began on May 21st, 1975, in Stuttgart-Stammheim It lasted over 2 years. The court sat on 192 days The action and dialogue are based on authentic documents and events Andreas Bernd Baader, unemployed Gudrun Ensslin, student Ulrike Marie Meinhof, journalist Jan-Carl Stefan Raspe, sociologist You are accused jointly in 9 independent actions.. …of killing 4 persons by means constituting a public menace… …and of attempting to kill 54 other persons… …and of causing explosions… …which endangered the lives and property of other persons… …and of forming an organization… …the aim of which was to perpetrate criminal acts Even after their arrest… …the accused stuck to their goals I do not, as yet, have a defense counsel We do not accept the legalistic packaging of this event Defense is impossible when laws are constantly being changed We insist, however, on a legal platform… …to demonstrate the collapse of the bourgeois state's ideological arguments… …and to explain revolutionary politics You are free to call any lawyer you trust Not easy to find one who can stand the persecution of the State For 3 years the prosecution has vetted the defense's every word… …search law practices, confiscating mail… …and bugging lawyers' cell visits We don't accept the laws of the bourgeois state But if you kick them around, what then? The Public Prosecutor barred 3 defense counsel… …less than 30 days before the trial began This smashed the defense Herr Baader is adequately defended… …by 2 state-appointed counsel Those lawyers were forced upon me They've never even spoken to me Someone's written ''Off with his head'' Someone's written ''Off with his head'' on my microphone That's too deep for me Yes, counsel! These remarks compel me to state the following… Don't speak for me! I'm not speaking to Frau Ensslin Shut your trap! It's not your turn to speak That creep should shut up! - Frau Ensslin! - Stop babbling on! I'm not babbling. Just listen You are incompetent! Just a minute. Calm down! You may not leave Please sit down Do you refuse that too? There's no rule saying they must sit Oh yes, there is In the interests of security. the accused must be seated Resume your seats We shall of course not sit. The choice is yours Either the compulsory squad shuts up or we force you to remove us All right. Remain standing for now I understand them not wanting… …a court-appointed defense, but… Damn it! Get us out of here! If they speak, we disrupt proceedings I suggest you bar us from the court at such times… …to avoid these idiotic scenes Make the pigs shut their snouts Whom do you mean? It's them or us! If the court-appointed defense speaks… …you'll continue to obstruct? The accused have no confidence it them. They also call them who should keep their ''snouts'' shut That's exactly the tone they adopt for their own counsel out of court In writing they have repeatedly called them pigs, assholes… …idiots, screwed-up people, etc… Their lawyers may accept it but not a state defense If clients call us assholes, idiots, and we say similar things to them… …that is between the client and ourselves These points may seem absurd, but they show this is a political trial It is laudable that these counsel… …are prepared to defend the accused despite the abuse they receive I observe that one of these ''laudable counsel'' has fallen asleep - Are you sure? - Yes, first on the left No expresson of mirth from the public, please Yes, Herr Baader You are staging a trial with psychologically broken prisoners That's why we insist on our own defense Even though it won't change the outcome Judges sometimes turn down promotion to avoid cases like this Can you stay the course? I hope so. Time will tell Is it a political or criminal trial? How long will it last? For us it's a normal criminal case… …although we can't deny political motives will play a certain role I cannot assess how long it will take We shall conduct it as concisely as possible But that does not depend on the good will ot the court alone The other parties must also be willing to cooperate I request a 10-day adjournment… …to prepare the case and study the material We'll decide that later I don't even have the papers, Get them from your barred colleagues We have no spare copies here I'm sure his colleagues will help Can you credit it? In this trial, millions have been spent on security Yet the court balks at providing my colleague with document For reasons of cost? You cannot be taken seriously Yesterday a prison officer handed me an anonymous letter It urged me to use this It got past your censor I ordered the letter delivered, not the noose Desist from further provocation I said nothing Nothing to say, you mean? It I misunderstood something. I don't need a chorus… …of 4 defense counsel If you wish to read the paper, kindly do so outside 4 p.m. The accused cannot continue My learned friend is obstructing Adjournment refused I shall retire at 4 p.m. We cannot force you to stay. The court will proceed till 4:15 The common room tap is broken. The common room tap is broken. How can it break when it's never used? I assume something's being done? I'll look info it The accused cannot continue As far as I'm concerned, the day is over The feeling my head is exploding The feeling my marrow is being pressed info my brain The feeling my brain is shriveling like a prune The feeling I'm constantly alive with electricity, as if remote-controlled The feeling I'm pissing out my soul I wake up, open my eyes. The cell is moving In the afternoon, when the sun shines, it suddenly stops Impossible to stop the sensation of movement Impossible to say if I'm shivering with fever or cold Raging aggression with no outlet The worst thing is knowing I have no chance of survival With expensive nutrients… …we have done our best to improve the prisoners' health They were even given dark glassed when visual disorders arose Did you know the aim of the hunger strike? The aim? I believe the aim was an improvement in prison conditions Can you be more specific? Being together So, the aim was an end to isolation? Yes, that was why they refused food and drink If conditions had improved… …would it have ended earlier? You mean, would release from prison have reduced longer to life? You're just repeating the lies… …propagated by the media… …that it was to gain their release We always said the hunger strike would end if isolation ended You're being contentious Yes! Because I want the truth I do too You said better conditions lead to better health? And the reverse? - I don't understand - Is the opposite true? That severe conditions can ruin a prisoner's health? Obviously You've been a prison doctor for 20 years Have you even seen conditions like those in Stammheim? No, never Are they fit? The accused are fit to stand trial I declare I'm not fit I'm in no condition to express clearly the things I wish to say It's absurd to thing that these past 3 years have not affected us We want independent medical examination And a maximum of 3 hours per day in court Requests denied I challenge the bias of this court It repeatedly refuses to admit independent doctors Trey would reveal the use of torture against political prisoners The prosecution and intelligence services… …will only be satisfied when the prisoners are dead - Like justice in the Third Reich… - That comparison is an insult to this court Think of the insult your occupying that chair is to us Challenge dismissed They always say we're not isolated… …because we have larger cells than other prisoners But the fasts remain Apart from the hunger strike, we've been in total isolation for 3 years When we talk to each other through a slit in the door… …someone stands outside and writes it down Herr Baader is out of order To quote a US Supreme Court ruling: ''Disrespect for our courts of justice must not go unpunished'' ''The indefinite disruption of a trial by the accused will not be tolerated'' ''It debases our country and our system of justice… ''…if we allow our courts to be tyrannized, insulted, or humiliated'' All present should consider these words The defense would happily accept US law This trial would then be invalidated through prejudice… …as you remarks in court demonstrate It is not the role of the accused to judge the officers of justice. You stand accused of multiple murder The prosecution and court are at pains to maintain… …the utmost objectivity This is the first political trial in West Germany since 1945 The authorities cannot see a victim in the object ot their destruction They see only a foe they want to crush This shows a basic difference with our struggle Even in a Fascist, we can see the victim of a system It's not we who are fanatics, but the authorities They never answer our arguments. They are merely formalistic State your grounds for rejecting this court In South Africa, political prisoners… …are interrogated for 3 months If they haven't talked by then, it's clear they will die under torture So they are shot I'm not saying prisoners are treated more humanely in South Africa What I mean is… …where torture fails as a means of extorting information… …all that's left is death The purpose of detention is the death of the prisoner No such purpose exists in German law. I rule you out of order Superficial examination by the person doctor… …cannot assess fitness to stand trial We'll resume our defense when evidence is based on fact, not on expedients The trial will proceed in your absence We refuse to continue when the accused are not fit What's the meaning of this? You should bar us! Be seated! Have us removed! Do you want us to start screaming? Stop your nonsense, idiot! Be seated and participate in a peaceful fashion So you refuse to sit? So you want us to make a formal protest? Remove us! If you continue to disrupt proceedings you'll be barred Do it, you old fool Are you all agree? Yes… are you deaf? You refuse to remain? The public must be seated to leave the room The accused have disrupted proceedings and will be barred The witness may withdraw We shall move on to the particulars of the accused They have to be present. Bring them in again… one by one First, Raspe. By force if need be Please identify anyone in the public creating a disturbance… …so appropriate measures may be taken - Please be seated - No - The evidence is about your preson - I'm not interested - Speak about yourself - I've been dragged here Use the microphone If you don't bar me. I'll jump… The accused Raspe is barred Bring Frau Meinhof in Be seated No Will you use the microphone at least? I don't want you to hear I'm not fit to defend myself A statement about yourself? Not under these circumstances. I want to leave - It's your duty to stay - You can't force me, asshole! I note the fact you called the judge ''asshole'' Note it then! The accused is barred from proceedings Be seated No, someone knocked my chair over Pick the chair up Please have me barred It's not a case of what you want. Tell me some disruptive acts, then Must I insult you? I don't want to You force me to stay? I have to. I don't want to Want insults? I'd rather you didn't utter abuse. I'll stop your dirty maneuver It's not a dirty maneuver. I'm bound by procedural rules Do you want physical violence? I want you to sit end take part calmly It's a dirty maneuver, damn it! Forcing me to insist you bar me I just want to leave It's not a case of personal wishes. It's your duty. Fine. Carry on with this silly procedure. I'll carry on disrupting You haven't disrupted yet Have me removed, or I'll have to insult you Want to? You can have it in various ways I don't want it For instance, you're a Fascist asshole Fascist asshole, eh? - Remove me. - Me too, you fat pig I hereby state you're an old Fascist asshole Turn his microphone off We're not in a fit state to defend ourselves. Pig! You have disrupted proceedings and called me ''pig''. Is that correct? And Herr Baader said ''Fascist asshole'' - You may speak about your person - Dirty rat! Remove the accused! The court will retire to deliberate 11 o'clock news from Radio Stuttgart On the 39th day of the Baader-Meinhof trial in Stammheim… …reports were presented by 3 medical experts They conclude that the accused… …are suffering from debility, perception and articulation disorders… …weight loss, low blood pressure, and loss of concentration In Andreas Baader's case… …a low heart-rate was diagnosed And in Frau Meinhof's case, an inability to concentrate They are fit taje part 3 hours a day - Hear the radio? - The pigs finally caught on The trial will proceed without the accused on grounds of… - Do not interrupt - I wish to speak No one may speak at present We have a legal right to be heard You no longer have the right I haven't spoken yet, you pig! I will now give the grounds This is real brutality Stick your pig's head up your ass! Remove Raspe! An unbelievably repressive act! Remove the accused Request for adjournment refused After the medical report, you want to bar the accused… …because they are not fit to take part. It's outrageous! You will not prevent us stating the grounds for our decision You merely reveal your manners Killer! Your purpose as a judge is to thin the ranks Remove Ensslin! We shan't forger your role here Your trial of bent witnesses and false evidence will fail You can't escape the fact we're not fit, after 3 years of torture Remove Meinhof! Imperialist pig! You won't be forgotten, you swine! Your time will come Now you can have your show trial The accused are considered unfit to take part in the proceedings An accused person cannot impede a trial… …by unfitness of his own causing Try the code for the protection of birds That is piece of impertinence So is your handling of this case The evidence will take a long time The prosecution has called 997 witnesses and 80 experts Limiting proceedings to 9 hours per week would make the trial too long The accused's hunger strike… …willfully weakened their health Shame on you They may return when fit Incredible! Incredible! You destroy the constitutional state My congratulations! I was in the officers' mess, US headquarters in Frankfurt It went dark and we thought a storm was brewing Then a flash, and a shattering sound The roof and everything caved in I got out I saw Col. Bloomquist lying there He had a lump of glass from the door in his artery No one came to help. They were afraid other bombs would do off He lay with his face to the right To the right? There was blood.. red blood Yes, blood is usually red Were you hurt? No, I was shaken, that's all An American officer took me to his flat and tended me I worked as an ambulance driver in the US hospital in Heidelberg I was called to the computer center at US headquarters I searched the rubble for survivors Under a window was a body, still moving I saw a second body under a Coca Cola machine… just his foot stuck out We moved the machine but the man was dead I then saw an officer whose body was torn apart, only the top half left The other bits were scattered in the lime trees nearby The soles of his feet were still on the ground - not a pretty sight We took a pillowcase and gathered up the bits of the body After the second bomb explosion… … there was an officer who looked like he'd been scalped We bandaged him and took him to hospital He called himself ''Erwin''. Now I know he was Holger Meins Later he brought Jan-Carl Raspe whom he introduced as ''Lester'' They looked round my metal workshop Said they needed props for a film about revolution They had something like the top of a hand grenade And asked if I could make a similar one I made more objects Weapons and bombs for the lilm You're a metal sculptor. Aren't you interested in films too? To a certain extent If you work on a film, don't you ask questions? What king of film? Who's involved? Don't you ever know? I asked, but ''Erwin'' was evasive I became uneasy, and said: ''You're mixed up in something. Count me out, or I'll call the police'' Then ''Erwin'' pulled a gun and said I was in it up to my neck One day he brought a man I now know is Baader It was a strange scene He marched info my workshop He walked round looking at this and that inspecting everything… …as if it belonged to him You dummy-maker! One more interruption, Raspe, and you'll be barred. Later I supplied more bomb casing -…I withdrew - Withdrew? That's good You rattled off your statement… …like an automatic train… …as if you knew it by heart Why is Frau Meinhof familiar with him? It's up to the witness… Your statement doesn't interest much But are you aware that it will be used… …to portray Andreas and the media as the boss? The government wants the public to believe… …that Andreas is the one they must break and ultimately kill… …so that the urban guerrilla problem in West Germany will be solved Question not valid. Personal opinion you say you were coerced The group's relations with sympathizers preclude coercion Were you forced to work? Yes, it was like I described. You know very well Nearer the microphone, please I won't tolerate all remarks being met with laughter I fail to see anything funny here Your statement sounds like it's written by someone working for the police The wording is by the interrogator. The witness says when he disagrees that's incredible. Not his own words, but a judge's Did the interrogating officer promise you a new life in the US? I don't think I can answer. For my own safety. Were you offered… …financial help, false documents? Money wasn't mentioned I can't say yes or no to the other question Was a pardon mentioned? Or clemency? They spoke of ''voluntary penitence'', and gave me the law to read You can't read! The masks of tiredness. How sick of them I am How they have nauseated me. Forever and everywhere Murmuring clergymen, boy scouts, maiden aunts Scoffing women, youths Ancient creatures, smothered in make-up How sick I am of it. Hinger, simple to know Am I in a film? Or am I real: fight! Statements like the last one are always obtained the same way The techniques used are dependence, exhaustion end fear The victim becomes totally dependent on his interrogator The only person who can help him The only person he has contact with Sometimes the interrogator lends a sympathetic ear The victim feels indebted to him Witnesses are not manipulated Their evidence affords deep insight into the group's hierarchy The accused still haven't explained it It would be an act of courage Does that super-hypocrite expect, after 3 years' isolation… …that we suddenly confess because a phony witness pops up? I request Frau Ensslin be parred for abuse The accused is barred from court until end February 1976 I support Gudrun's rejection It's 4 p.m. Can I give my reasons tomorrow? No. But you can withdraw. You're not obliged to stay 'Rejection is a farce. This court is here to stay but you… …pass sentence on yourselves too Shit! You take us for fools! Remove that man. This is unbelievable More unbelievable is your declaration of war against the accused but wars have the Geneva Convention That protects prisoners against the calculated destruction of their health… …for which you blame the prisoners themselves I'm warning you The High Court found the conditions lawful The prisoners are dangerous adherents of the Red Army Faction Ideological justice! It's absurd to say we would disrupt prison order How? When? Where? How can we disrupt when in 3 years we've never even spoken to another inmate? How can a prisoner in isolation reveal to the authorities a change in behavior? How? In a situation in which all expression of life is suppressed The prisoner in isolation has only one way to express a change of heart By betrayal There is no other way Isolation provides two possibilities Either they force a prisoner to silence That is, he dies there Or, he talks And that is betrayal That is torture, clear-cut torture Forcing confessions by means of isolation Punishing and confusing the prisoner You are out of order Next witness! You occupied a cell next to the witness accused ot making bombs? Yes, I asked him why he was making a confession. He said they threatened to charge him with conspiracy to murder but if he gave evidence, they'd help him start a new life in the US - Why are you in jail? - Politics We have no political prisoners What's your offense? Waging war against capitalist exploitation By what means? That's how you coerce your witnesses Herr Baader is barred from proceedings You have to reply I don't Yes, you do Ridiculous! Quiet! Don't shout! Stop playing the clown The consequences for… Stick your consequences up your ass Silence! Or I'll clear the court I sentence you to 3 days punishment Know what being on oath means? I don't swear oaths. You believe me or you don't You refuse to take the oath? On principle - There's a 1,000 mark fine -Cash? According to Clause 61… …oaths are waived if the accused agree The accused are not all present Bring Baader Can we waive the oath? Couldn't care less. They're your rules Yes or no? This is a farce! -Do you waive it? Yes or no? - I already did Frau Ensslin? Don't give a damn Of course I waive it Me too I also bring a plea to reject this court… …because of the way you throw Andreas out… …then bring him in but don't let him speak - It's grotesque - Witness dismissed - I wish to speak - Remove the witness! I wish to state why I am a political prisoner I'll smash you, you pigs! Like that sort of thing, don't you? Do you wish to justify your rejection? The court knows, because you bug our conversations… …that we intend to set this case straight politically This case, the peak of political justice… …is just plain Fascist - It's capitalist politics - Out of order! This scene reveals the total brutality of this machine I'll read what Ulrike wanted to say but was not allowed to To say my strained relations with you… …come from my lack of revolutionary force… …was shameful, considering what I'm going through My Fascist conditioning, through sadism and religion… …caught up with me because L never broke my links wit the ruling class I crawled to the Red Army Faction as I did to he bourgeoisie Treating you like cops means having been a pig myself A hypocritical swine from the ruling classes We knew the Springer building… …had been surrounded by students… …and we'd been prevented from going to work It was blocked off We had to put up with their abuse But putting a bomb there? No one could've believed that Were you hurt? Yes, a bruised chest And your workmates? Yes. Broken ribs, cuts, lacerations, impaired hearing… It's a wonder no one was killed You're an editor with Springer Press? I was in a meeting when it went off It was one of 5 bombs - not all of them exploded Most people fled. But journalists are inquisitive We stood chatting, when suddenly there was a bang, ant it went dark I looked round at the wounded I was amazed they'd hit at proofreaders They are usually left-wing If they'd hit the computer center. They'd have damaged Springer more Terrorism is the destruction of facilities… …dykes, reservoirs, hospitals… …power stations… All those have been bombed by the US in Vietnam since 1964 Terrorism intimidates the masses. Urban guerrillas only threaten the state I cannot accept irrelevant arguments You want to stop us saying anything at all Frau Meinhof, go on Urban guerrilla actions are not aimed at the people They combat the terrorism of the imperialist state Enough! You're a washout Turn Baader's microphone off Master of microphones, not of this court This is not a normal case It's a clash between the bourgeois capitalist state and its radical opponents Dr. Horst Herold, President of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, said: ''Is terrorism in Germany and the world the brainchild of a Baader or a Meinhof? ''The sick brain as many see it ''Or does terrorism… …stem from the economic situation in the Western world? ''Does it merely reflect a problem? ''The crucial question is: who fights terrorism? ''Police or politicians? ''I say this with reluctance ''but the tendency is to introduce special international laws'' For 5 years, Herold used us as an excuse to extend his apparatus He wants international anti-guerrilla laws for his own ends He says:''I am the man to wage this war ''Give me the apparatus, the money ''And above all, the political power'' Herold advocates the police state- the height of reaction While our judge here keeps banging away at us What's the matter with her? Who are you kidding? You hate us There are plenty of signs It shows in your passivity, withdrawal… …bad grammar, destructiveness, misunderstanding, etc. … I've no time for that type of self-criticism Pull yourself together or go to hell! You undermine us—even the law can't It's not mystical to say I can't go on I can't stand feeling so defenseless Lots goes on in my head, I say nothing but I could scream at your malice It's as if there's a deal I'm no part of I keep quiet while Gudrun lies Paranoia. You pig! How can I pull myself together… …when her image of me is a pig? Two total lunatics! The accused do not deny Red Army Faction political responsibility… …for attacks on US Army installations in West Germany That is not, however, a statement if individual responsibility We wish to call the following witnesses; Former US President Richard M. Nixon Former Defense Secretary Melvin Laird Ex-Chief of Staff, US Forces in Vietnam… The witnesses will testify that they… …willfully killed a great many Vietnamese… …and inflicted suffering on others… How low would you stoop to eradicate baseness? To change the world, to what lengths would you go? It is terrible to kill Not only others… we kill ourselves This lethal world must be changed by force Everyone knows that We accept these charges. In part we conceived them But our politics are not bound by state laws Condemning revolutionary politics… …only shows the system is a lie I rule you out of order These charges reveal that the purpose of this trial is… …control of the state by US capital The petitions are of course futile In fact, compared to this trial… …a Fascist court martial at least has the courage of its convictions We shall also call… …two former US secret agents… ..to testify that the computer at US headquarters, Heidelberg… …was used to plot the aerial bombing… ..of civilian areas of South Vietnam… …and the bombing of dykes in North Vietnam The aim was to achieve the maximum number of civilian deaths The accused are not interested in establishing the truth They want to use this trial for agitation and self- glorification If evidence shows West German territory was used to abet US war crimes… …thes West Germany itself is contravening international law Imagine a bomb attack on the Security Headquarters of the Third Reich Imagine a trial conducted against those accused of planting the bomb Would you refuse to allow evidence which showed… …that the decisions to exterminate Jewish fellow-citizens… …were coordinated in that establishment? Every lawyer knows that in certain circumstances… …there is a legal right of ''justifiable defense''… …even when it leads to loss of life There is no such right that would justify these attacks But the images are the same Jewish children walking towards the SS men who destroyed the ghetto And Vietnamese children burned by napalm running towards the photographer The evidence hinges on this Does one tolerate such acts of murder? Or is one justified in taking action against the mechanism which allows it? The Vietnam war is irrelevant here Within the jurisdiction of our law… …''justifiable defense'' notwithstanding… What's the difference between our heads and hands… …and American bombers in Vietnam? Pity we weren't more effective militarily We attacked the CIA headquarters… … the 5th Army Corps HQ in Frankfurt …and the US Army HQ in Heidelberg We joined the Red Army Faction in 1970… …and adhered to its politics and its structure So we are also politically responsible for commando raids… …such as the Springer bombing… …which we did not make part in, and which we reject 109th day of the trial The trial will proceed of Baader, Ensslin and Raspe Frau Meinhof's death closes her case Some members of the public did not rise May I remind you that provocations of this type… …will mean your removal from the courtroom Proceed with your cross-examination I request a 10-day adjournment Ulrike Meinhof's death creates a new situation It's not a legal point. Common decency demands an adjournment I just want to say that we believe Ulrike was executed We don't know how. But we know by whom, and why A cold act of execution The court will not tolerate contempt It Ulrike had chosen to die… …as the one way of preserving her revolutionary identity… …she would certainly have told us - Andreas at least No memorial speeches, please Do you wish to bring a charge? I'll be brief To what purpose? - Let me finish - Do you intend bringing a charge? Hurry, or you can't proceed I support the request for adjournment Why not say that before? Proceed Sadist! You interrupt to confuse him Is was a brother/sister relationship, based on political ideals She was free; freedom only exists in the struggle for liberation To say there were tensions between Ulrike and Andreas… …and use Ulrike's death in your psychological warfare… …shows how stupid you are! Out of order Oh yes, your sadism, your methods… You're a killer! Yes, you are. Under your presidency of this court… …3 out 5 prisoners have been killed And when we denounce the machine you so sadistically represent… …you stop us speaking You've no right to speak for Raspe In the public's eyes, the name of Ulrike Meinhof… …is associated with high standards of morality It's therefore worth reflecting… …that her death occurred when the defense introduced a political element It's hard for me to say anything We shouldn't speak to you at all now It is time to act - Antagonism between state and… - Out of order You stop me speaking? Yes, if it's not a submission Not in front of this horde of rats Contempt of court A person deprived of freedom… …has employed the profound, puzzling freedom of suicide That's reason enough to suspend the proceedings of this court The situation needs to be clarified A sense of piety should make it impossible to proceed… …until the deceased is laid to rest There's no reason to grant the request There is no provision for adjournment on the death of an accused It the funeral occurs on a day the court is sitting… … the prosecution does not object to an afternoon start Plea to suspend proceedings denied The defense will not proceed until after Ulrike Meinhof's funeral Your behavior here allows no relationship with you… …other than waiting for you with a gun She did not have the mental and emotional make-up of a true terrorist She was often no more than a tool Her name was used to influence certain people But it's wrong to think she was just a victim What happened in Frankfurt exactly? Ulrike Meinhof came to Frankfurt She suggested attacking the Springer building in Hamburg She was responsible for planning and organization She was given bombs Afterwards the rest of the group criticized her. Why? Because workers were injured as a result Wasn't that to be expected in an action like that? Yes, people were targets as well Baader complained that print workers were hurt Really licking asses now, you pig Was there any kind of hierarchy? A natural pecking order, so to speak Yes. Baader was the brains at the top Then there was the nucleus of Meinhof, Meins, Raspe, Ensslin Then same rank-and-file members, and fringe members You climbed the ladder How were you to react… …if threatened with capture? We had instructions to shoot Carrying guns was idealized, the image of the true guerrilla Anyone involved in a shootout was idolized Anyone killed or injured was treated like a martyr Members would stand in front of mirrors drawing guns Where were you in October 1971? Kiel and Hamburg know the Saseler Damm in Hamburg? Saseler Damm, you mean So you know the car park behind the shopping center? That's going too far You needn't incriminate yourself Where were you… …on 21st October 1971? The microphone's off The questions obviously refer to the murder of the policeman Schmid The case is still on progress. I don't wish to comment But I didn't shoot the policeman I won't answer further questions on this Did you shoot PC Schmid? He said no If you didn't, who did? I refuse to reply When others accused you, did you say you were proud? - Proud you shot a pig? - Disgraceful! - Ever held a gun? - No reply Ever talk about Schmid? No comment In this case I find refusal to reply unjustified It's justified Is your evidence… …contained in files 3 ARP 74/75, held by the Public Prosecutor? What are they? Was a decision about these lives… …taken by the Ministry of Justice? - Do you recall? - I heard something of the kind The Ministry refuses to release these files Do they contain your statement? It's possible How would your statement damage West Germany if it were made public? What do you mean? Part of your statement has been declared ''secret'' That's not a proper question. Invalid Did your interrogators in Bonn… …threaten you? - Yes They said if I didn't talk I'd be tried, like the others That scared you? I protest against the insinuation… …that the witness was bought off ot brainwashed by the West German authorities The witness may also be guilty, but I find him credible Saul converted to Paul too In a constitutional state which believes in rehabilitation… …this should be recognized Anyone who succeeds in breaking free from a criminal group… …deserves understanding, even respect It's noticeable that the accused have not confronted the witnesses They have chosen not to appear in court on the days… …that the victims of the 6 bomb explosions gave evidence We thank the Chief Public Prosecutor for being present Did the investigating officers… …promise the witness special treatment for making his statement? The Public Prosecutor's Office has already replied to this question I declare that none of the persons named was promised any form of favor… …nor threatened with any penalty… …nor was any influence exerted on the contend of their statements Do you know of file ARP 74/75? Of course I know of its existence And the contents? I'm not permitted to answer Does it contain the interrogation… - …of the last witness? - I can't say You ordered it classified? I suggested it There's a blueprint to integrate internal and external security It will create a central counter-insurgency apparatus… …which be integrated with NATO, and based in West Germany… …because parliamentary opposition is unlikely Irrelevant to the presence of this witness You are digressing They're his initiatives London Institute for Conflict Studies: how to combat terrorism What concerns us here are the murder charges against you The military/strategic background concerns me So do the peculiarities of this trial, and the elimination of prisoners I should rule you out of order for that Special court, judges, building You're not here to make a case against the witness Ask questions, nothing else Okay! I'll ask him if he know these directives 1. Infiltrate terrorist organizations 2. Locate terrorist headquarters 3. Eliminate leaders Irrelevant to the charges against you Whatever you think, the Public Prosecutor does not initiate such measures Out of order Do you know of NATO papers advocating… …military action against the Red Army Faction? Inadmissible I renew my rejection of this court Dismissing this question proves you want to label the Red Army Faction… …a purely ''criminal alliance''… - And not a political… - Anyone else? It's futile, but I second the rejection The propaganda element is obvious: a campaign to exterminate the accused Here the law is a facade… …for the elimination of undesirables Out of order Did you know the authorities spread the rumor… …that the Red Army Faction has nuclear devices? I read something to the effect Where? In the papers Did you investigate the report? It may have been discussed To what effect? I don't know any derails to date Who discussed it? I can't remember When was it discussed? I don't remember that either Isn't it too unusual to forget? No, I don't think so You mean it's common… …to discover that certain groups have nuclear devices? The Public Prosecutor's Office deals with criminal prosecution That includes investigation Yes, of course So, ins't activity involving nuclear devices… …of such vital interest… …that your memory shouldn't fade so quickly? I repeat, this is irrelevant to the case We're assuming quality and quality… … of Red Army Faction operations If information concerning nuclear devices plays a role… …then the question is relevant Is anyone accused of possessing nuclear devices? - No, they aren't - Exactly Keep to the accusation Not everything comes under Clause 129 - ''criminal alliance'' Otherwise, a question like… … ''Did you know the Red Army Faction kills babies?''… …would also be valid Is that the kind of thing you thins of? The only reason we are here after Ulrike's death… …is to explain the true structure of our group… …not the one invented by the witness as psychological warfare Strategy was decided collectively by discussion The allegation that Ulrike bombed the Springer building on her own initiative… …or that there was in-fighting as that pig says.. Please refrain from abusing witnesses After the Springer operation, Ulrike went to face her critics in Hamburg They said her plan did not foresee… …Springer's refusal to clear the building This talk of tension… …attempts to legitimate her murder This murder accusation will lead to disciplinary measures I could't care less Did people leave the group? If so, how? Of course people left In the liberation struggle, conflicts always arise Some people want out, though it's not really possible once you've fought You just step back info the dirt But, of course, people left There was never talk of reprisals, though Only that case in Berlin But that woman betrayed several people. She gave names, and addresses She got a bucket of tar over her, and a sign around her neck: ''This informer's in league wit the killer pigs'' When a police informer gets nothing but a bucket of tat over her… …it's absurd to say that people who leave are shot During the hunger strike… …was pressure applied not to break it? No, it was an individual's decision… …whether he wanted to give up the struggle and live When I came here, I had only one thing in mind: resistance Not only because it was important politically But also because I needed it to preserve my identity Soom there was only one question: how? I nearly went out of my mind trying to answer it Give me another one - You began the hunger strike? - Yes - Then you broke it off? - Yes Why did you start again? It was a clear decision I just didn't take it immediately Breaking it off like that was the result of being isolated We'd been in isolation for 3 years Why did you start again? It was an existential decision, dammit. Can't you understand? Was it you own decision? Of course Naturally the group said: ''Hey, start again'' And Holger Meins wrote to me saying: ''If you shit your pants, wash them'' Pretty strong stuff That was the group The letter helped a lot. I didn't feel so lost Your own free will… No! The Public Prosecutor is determined to destroy us That's not free will We had 2 choices: keep fighting, ot be manipulated… ..like your chief witness After Holger was murdered, they tried to break me… …but they backed the wrong horse In a letter to Baader, you wrote: ''You threaten me just like a cop ''Haing myself, you say. Nothing new it that'' At another point: ''You can't expect any more from us… ''…unless it's an order ''Ok, I obeyed the order and began the hunger strike again'' Still say there was no pressure? Of course You imply it's the witness's letter - Your writing? - Yes As I said, the hunger strike was part of the struggle… …a last-ditch stand, an existential decision… …between life and death, as in any armed action For a revolutionary, life's not the most precious thing The choices were; hanging oneself… We are not concerned with hanging, but with… That's the worst penalty Do you still say pressure was not applied? Yes, I do Fine, that's all Can I only say yes or no? Being told to hang oneself is the toughest sanction So there were sanctions? No! The problem is you imply an authoritarian structure! I told you I had completely flipped I lost contact. I wouldn't have stopped the hunger strike otherwise The whole letter is muddled ideas I forget that, although I'd stopped the hunger strike.. …I could resume the fight any time Another bit of self-criticism? You fool! What do you know of criticism ot self-criticism? It's absurd! - Further questions? None - I haven't finished This is for Ulrike, you pig! Open the door! What's up? Better get a quick transfer. You too! We won't accept closed doors at recreation time Leave the door open, pig They've gone mad Open the door! You insinuated I was in there for a screw. They want war? They'll get it It the name of the accused Ensslin I request… …removal of the presiding judge 61st plea against bias He has ordered more stringent conditions Recreation periods on the 7th floor have been suspended These stringent conditions… …contravene the minimum standards set out in the medical reports Baader is obviously afraid of losing his position as boss Why else would a prisoner who has hitherto remained aloof… …suddenly attack a warder? All I can say about the prisoner's health is: See what a person… …allegedly tortured by isolation… …is capable of Prison conditions are generous. Ensslin is allowed to play the violin Given Frau Ensslin's position… …describing a little violin practice as generous conditions… …is a degree of cynicism.. …I wouldn't have believed possible This woman has spent over 4 years in group isolation… …which Amnesty International lists… …as a clear from of torture But you lack the sensitivity to imagine it The plea to reject this court dismissed This is from a High Court judge to the editor of Die Welt ''Dear fraternity member… ''Please destroy these documents ofter use ''No need to send me a copy of Die Welt. I subscribe'' And where did the judge get the trial documents? From our presiding judge. That means.. Ach, a new dodge by your lawyers. What's the point? In the name of the accused Ensslin… 62nd! …I reject the presiding judge on grounds of bias Unbeknownst to fellow judges… …he gave trial documents (including verbatim evidence) to a third person… …that is to Judge Mayer, of the Court Appeal That Court of Appeal… …will be responsible for any appeal against the sentence… …which you, Your Honor, pass The High Court judge gave these documents to the editor of Die Welt I support the plea to reject this court The grounds for this plea need clarifying If not, the trial will be permanently flawed Forgive me phoning you privately Your Honor? I know your decision today was not easy, but… Your Honor, I don't really think… Your challenge was my worst moment in the whole 2 years Your Honor, I… It makes a difference if a challenge comes from your side of the defense But from the accused's point of view, any appeal is now futile Two members in the High Court have collaborated… …to secure an appeal-proof verdict The accused don't care. Only the lawyers That's hard to imagine in their position I know for certain that the accused couldn't care less The warders told me this document thing doesn't interest them One even said: '' A new dodge by your lawyers'' Imagine the terrible strain I'm under I'm finished if I don't stick it out I warn that if you show disrespect for the court… ..,you will be barred from proceedings The court is now in session Baader rejects the presiding judge… 63rd! …on the grounds that he contacted a defense lawyer outside this court During their conversation, he said… …it makes a difference whether a plea of rejection… ..comes from this side of the defense ot that The presiding judge is guilty of bias once again The court will reconvene at 10 a.m. A decision will be announced then The plea of rejection is sustained The court will retire to reconsider the course of the trial The trial will proceed You wish to make a submission I wish to call the Interior Minister to explain… …and between the accused and defense counsel.. …have been illicitly recorded… …and made available to security forces In his attempt to attract publicity… …counsel is confusing a plea to hear evidence… with a plea to institute investigations The accusations are inventions. Calling this witness is not justified I beg you to avoid pointed and defamatory remarks It is alleged that bugging devices… …were employed to spy on the accused Prosecution may surely use such terms The court will look the matter I wish to clarify that in Stammheim… …in two cases of emergency… …warranted by Clause 3 of the Penal Code… …we listened to conversations… …between defense counsel and the Baader-Meinhof gang The grounds for the decision, taken jointly… …to listen in to Baader-Meinhof leaders and their lawyers… …was to avert a concrete danger… …which could not otherwise have been averted… …to the lives of innocent The prosecution has the nerve to talk of propaganda ruses What is happening is this trial can only be described… …as the systematic destruction of constitutional guarantees This is of vital importance to the nation The case must be adjourned until the bugging has been explained I support the submission If a room provided for the defense is bugged, counsel cannot use it Both the Justice Minister… …and Interior Minister… …said they would do the same again in a similar situation The court must say how it will prevent further bugging It must adjourn until such time None of the prosecuting counsel knew of these actions A statement will be made when we have… …full knowledge of the facts The trial will proceed with… I withdraw in protest As you wish Our continued presence would merely legitimate this morass There is a strong suspicion… …that this trial and this prison are run by a criminal alliance I too am unable to continue. I beg the court to respect my decision - You wish to speak? - A submission I submit that Brandt and Schmidt be called, as heads of government They can testify that since 1972 the Red Army Faction has been persecuted… …in an illegal and unconstitutional manner all right, out with it! We wish to call the Interior Minister… …to clarify whether the accused's cells were bugged We also call the Chancellor's office… …to testify that bugging was carried out… …by the Intelligence Service on the 7th floor of Stammheim prison… …and that they had continued uncontrolled access to this area At the outset of the trial, we said our conversations were bugged The prosecution denied it… …hypocritically, and with a great show of indignation But it's absurd to think they did not know After Ulrike's murder, the prosecution… The prosecution also innocent until proved guilty - I didn't specify a person - You said murder Behind a murder is a murderer. Otherwise it is merely a death After Ulrike's death, the prosecution spoke of tension between prisoners How did they know, if not by bugging? We were utterly ignorant of this whole bugging affair I wish to state the aims of the hunger strike we begin today No speaking of prison conditions during the trial It is obvious that political statements are now superfluous Accused and defense counsel did not attend court again On April 28th, 1977, the 192nd day of the trial… …Baader, Ensslin and Raspe were sentenced to life imprisonment The Red Army Faction kidnapped Hans Martin Schleyer… …to force the prisoners's release The government refused any exchange Hijacking a Lufthansa jet ended with the storming of the plane in Mogadishu The next day, Baader, Ensslin and Raspe were found dead in their cells The state prosecutor's verdict was suicide
