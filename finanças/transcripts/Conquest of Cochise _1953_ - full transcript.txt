ON A SPRING DAY IN 1853, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TUCSON, THEN IN THE TERRITORY OF MEXICO, DON FELIPE DE CORDOVA AND HIS WIFE WERE TAKING THEIR USUAL SUNDAY MORNING RIDE. ALTHOUGH THE WAR BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES HAD ENDED, AND ALL SEEMED PEACEFUL, THE PEACE OF NORTHERN MEXICO WAS AGAIN TO BE THREATENED BY THE DREADED APACHES, AND THE SAVAGE COMANCHE. IN MEXICO CITY, A TREATY WAS BEING DISCUSSED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS TO BECOME KNOWN TO HISTORY AS "THE GADSDEN PURCHASE." TEN MILLION DOLLARS? A GENEROUS OFFER, WE THINK, FOR LAND WHICH IS OF NO PRACTICAL VALUE TO YOU, BEING CHIEFLY DESERT. AND TO WHICH OUR NATION HAS, PERHAPS, AS MANY LEGAL CLAIMS AS YOUR OWN. BUT THERE IS MORE THAN LAND INVOLVED HERE, GENERAL GADSDEN. YOU KNOW THAT, AND SO DOES YOUR PRESIDENT PIERCE. HUMAN BEINGS-- MEXICAN NATIONALS ARE ALSO INVOLVED. NOW, TAKE FOR INSTANCE TUCSON-- ONE OF OUR PROVINCIAL CAPITALS WILL BECOME PART OF UNITED STATES. WHAT WILL BECOME, THEN, TO OUR CITIZENS WHO ARE LIVING THERE? THEY CAN REMAIN CITIZENS OF MEXICO AS LONG AS THEY WISH. WELCOME GUESTS ON AMERICAN SOIL. OR IF THEY PREFER, THEY CAN BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS. YES. AND NATURALLY, ANY WHO PREFER TO DO SO, CAN LEAVE OUR COUNTRY, AND MOVE BELOW THE BORDER. BELOW THE BORDER? WHERE TRIBES OF INDIANS OF YOUR OWN COUNTRY ARE MAKING MURDEROUS RAIDS AGAINST MEXICAN RANCHERS? THAT IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE NOT OVERLOOKED. WE'RE TAKING STEPS TO MEET IT. SO... I HAVE PERSONALLY RECOMMENDED THE MAN BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB. OH, UH, MAJOR BURKE? UH-- MAJOR BURKE? THAT'S STRANGE. HE WAS HERE BUT A MOMENT AGO. UH, CAPTAIN LAWSON, WILL YOU SEE IF HE STEPPED OUTSIDE? YES, SIR. MAJOR BURKE? OH, NO. MAJOR? GENERAL GADSDEN WISHES YOU, SIR. YOU'VE BEEN WOUNDED AGAIN. HE'LL BE HERE SHORTLY, GENERAL. HE WAS CHECKING A TERRAIN MAP. THANK YOU. UH, MAJOR BURKE HAS SERVED WITH ME IN A NUMBER OF CAMPAIGNS. ALWAYS DILIGENTLY. I KNOW HIS CAPABILITIES. SORRY, SIR. I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T DESERT US, MAJOR BURKE. NOW, MAY I ASK YOU, HOW MANY MEN WILL YOU HAVE AT YOUR COMMAND? THE PRESENT PLANS CALL FOR FOUR TROOPS OF CAVALRY, SIR. DO YOU KNOW THAT THE APACHE INDIANS ALONE NUMBER TEN TIMES THAT MANY? SO I'VE HEARD. SO YOU'VE HEARD? HAVE YOU HEARD OF THEIR LEADER, A MAN NAMED COCHISE? YES, SIR. I'VE HEARD THE NAME. VERY WELL, THEN. WHEN YOU MEET HIM, YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT HE ALONE IS WORTH FOUR TROOPS OF CAVALRY. I HOPE COCHISE WON'T ATTACK IT. YOU HOPE? I'M CONVINCED OUR ONLY CHANCE TO SUCCEED OUR HERE IS TO MAKE HIM OUR FRIEND. COCHISE? FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD, HE'S JUST INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO ACCEPT OUR FRIENDSHIP. HE HASN'T FOUGHT AGAINST THE AMERICANS FOR A LONG TIME. WHY? COULD BE HE'S AFRAID OF US. I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S AFRAID OF ANYTHING. OH, JUST INTELLIGENT, HUH? THAT'S MY HUNCH. THE TRAP IS SET. SOON, THESE WHITE EYES WILL NOT SEE ANOTHER SUN. WE AWAIT YOUR COMMAND, TUKIWAH. I AWAIT THE COMMAND OF COCHISE. YOU ARE HERE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT, COCHISE. MANY SOLDIERS RIDE THE EASTERN PLANES FOR THE PASS. MORE THAN I HAVE YET SEEN AT ONE TIME. BUT FOR EACH, COCHISE HAS TWO WARRIORS WHO COULD REACH THE PASS FIRST. THESE ARE NOT SOLDIERS OF THE MEXICANOS. THESE ARE WHITE EYES. MEXICANOS. WHITE EYES. IS THERE A DIFFERENCE? YES. THEY ARE SOLDIERS MARCHING INTO OUR LAND. WOULD YOU LEAD US AGAINST THEM NOW? NO. NOT NOW. PRETTY SOON, TUCSON. WILL I BE GLAD TO SEE IT. UH-HUH. IT'LL BE NO BED OF ROSES THOUGH. ANYTHING'LL LOOK GOOD AFTER THIS TREK. DON'T BE SO SURE. REMEMBER, IT'S NO LONGER A PEACEFUL, MEXICAN VILLAGE. IT'S AN AMERICAN TOWN NOW. FRONTIER TOWN WITH ABOUT AS MUCH PEACE AS THERE IS LAW. BOTH GET BROKEN PRETTY REGULARLY. FIRST, IT WAS THE INDIANS. NOW, THESE PIGS. WILL IT NEVER END? PLEASE, SENORFELIPE. THEY WILL HEAR YOU. OH, I CAN'T STAND IT NO LONGER. MR. MADDOCK? I JUST SEEN A TROOP OF SOLDIER BOYS JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN A FEW MILES. UH-HUH? WELL, NOW... WE DON'T WANT 'EM TO GET THE IDEA THIS AIN'T A REAL RESPECTABLE TOWN, DO WE? SURE DON'T, MR. MADDOCK. SOLDIER BOYS BE GOOD CUSTOMERS. WAIT A MINUTE, GENTLEMEN. HOLD ON. NOW, TURN THAT MAN LOOSE. NO. YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID. TURN HIM LOOSE. WHAT'S THE MATTER, SAM? GOIN' SOFT? THIS MAN WAS TRIED AND CONVICTED. I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. JUST DON'T ASK ANYMORE QUESTIONS. NOW, GET GOIN'. ALL OF YOU. THIS IS A RESPECTABLE TOWN, UNDERSTAND? SEE? I TOLD YOU. I AM GLAD YOU DID NOTHING FOOLISH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M SURE SENORSAM MADDOCK DID NOT ACQUIRE A HEART OVERNIGHT. IT WILL DO YOU NO GOOD TO STARVE YOURSELF. SI, FELIPE. EAT. ONE NEEDS A STOMACH OF IRON TO EVEN THINK ABOUT EATING. SOON, THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS WILL BE HERE. THEN, THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT. THEY ARE JUST AS BAD. WORSE. WHEN THEY KILL AND PLUNDER, IT'S LEGAL. THE AMERICANS ARE OUR ONLY HOPE. OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO KILL ALL OF THEM ON SIGHT. THEY ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS. BUT THEY ARE HERE TO MAKE PEACE. PEACE? ON WHOSE AUTHORITY? IRRESPONSIBLE OPPORTUNISTS IN MEXICO CITY? THE WORD OF PRESIDENT PIERCE? ARE THEY GONNA KEEP COCHISE AND HIS SAVAGES FROM KILLING AND PLUNDERING BELOW THE BORDER? ARE THEY GONNA KEEP A SWINE LIKE MADDOCK FROM TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE HERE? IT IS POSSIBLE. NOT WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT I HAVE SEEN. I'M SURPRISED AT YOU, FRANCISCO. ALLOWING YOUR OWN DAUGHTER TO SPEAK THIS WAY. BETWEEN THE AMERICANS AND THE INDIANS, THEY'RE SLAUGHTERING US OFF LIKE CATTLE. MY WIFE... BEFORE MY VERY EYES. AND FOR NO REASON. CAN'T YOU FEEL WHAT I FEEL? SHE WAS YOUR OWN SISTER. BUT WE MUST BE PATIENT, FELIPE. I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THIS KIND OF TALK. I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN HOLD OUT MY HAND TO ANY OF THEM. AMERICANS OR INDIANS. WHISKEY. THREE TIMES. HELLO, TOM. WELL. SAM MADDOCK. FIGURED I'D FIND YOU HERE. GENTLEMEN, THIS IS SAM MADDOCK. ONE OF OUR BETTER KNOWN CAMP FOLLOWERS. HIYA, BOYS. WHAT BRINGS YOU TO TUCSON, SAM? FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD, IT'S NOT A HEALTH RESORT. BUSINESS. FOOD CONTRACTS FOR THE SOLDIERS. FORAGE CONTRACTS FOR THE ANIMALS. SADDLES. EQUIPMENT. GOT A LOT OF MONEY INVESTED, TOM. YOU'LL GET IT BACK. YOU ALWAYS DO. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. IT'S LEGITIMATE. DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T. HOW'S THE LAW AND ORDER BUSINESS? YOU GOT YOUR HAND IN THAT TOO? WELL, SORT OF. DON'T WORRY NONE ABOUT IT. YOU'LL FIND ME VERY COOPERATIVE. I'D BETTER. THERE'S NO SENSE GETTIN' OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT WITH THE ARMY. EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T REALLY INTERFERE WITH OUR CIVILIANS. CHARGE THESE UP TO ME. CAN'T HAVE OLD FRIENDS PAYIN' FOR THEIR DRINKS. COURSE NOT. IT'D BE BAD BUSINESS. LOOK ME UP, TOM. ANYTIME, HUH? SURE. REMEMBER THAT LITTLE CHARGER IN DODGE CITY THAT MISS, UM... CLAYPOOL? I THINK YOU CAN DO BETTER FOR YOURSELF RIGHT HERE. IF NOTHING ELSE, SAM, YOUR TASTE IS NOT BAD. BOYS. SENOR MAJOR. YES? I AM JOSE? ANTONIO DE LA VEGA Y GARCIA. SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE SURROUNDED. I COME WITH THE BEST WISHES OF DON FRANCISCO DE CORDOVA, WHOM I SERVE TO THE BEST OF MY LIMITED ABILITIES. OH? SO? DON FRANCISCO WOULD BE HONORED TO OFFER HIS HOSPITALITY. HIS HACIENDA IS THE FINEST IN ALL TUCSON. SO I'VE HEARD. IT WOULD BE HIS PLEASURE IF YOU WILL COME TO TEA. THIS AFTERNOON? TEA? SI. TEA. YES. WELL, UM... YOU TELL DON FRANCISCO IT'LL BE MY PLEASURE. GRACIAS, SENOR MAJOR. I WILL TELL HIM. HE WILL BE PLEASED AND I WILL BE PLEASED. ADIOS. WELL, GENTLEMEN... HERE'S TO US. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE INDIAN FIGHTERS, BUSINESS MEN, DIPLOMATS, AND SOCIAL LIONS. WHAT YOU TELL ME OF CONDITIONS HERE, DON FRANCISCO, TROUBLES ME. WHAT TROUBLES ME EVEN MORE IS-- THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. NATURALLY, WE HAD HOPED THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO RESTORE ORDER HERE. YES, WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, MY ONLY MISSION IS TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE INDIANS. I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO INTERFERE IN CIVILIAN AFFAIRS. THEN UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE OUR HOMES HERE. DESPITE THE INVITATION OF YOUR GOVERNMENT TO STAY. NOT NECESSARILY. IT MAY NOT MEAN MUCH, BUT I'VE HAD ASSURANCES FROM MADDOCK OF REASONABLE COOPERATION. MADDOCK. YOU AND YOUR HOPES. YOU'LL DIE WITH THEM. IF WE LEAVE HERE, THERE IS EVEN GREATER DANGER. BECAUSE OF THE INDIANS, IT WOULD ALL BE A QUESTION OF TIME. THAT'S WHERE I KNOW I CAN HELP. MY DEAR. COME IN. SEE? I TOO HAVE LIEUTENANTS. MAY I PRESENT MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER? MAJOR BURKE. SENORA. SENORITA. YOU'RE FORTUNATE, DON FRANCISCO. MY LIEUTENANTS ARE NOT NEARLY SO BEAUTIFUL. MAJOR BURKE IS TO BE OUR GUEST. HERE IN OUR HOUSE. BIENVENIDOS, SENOR. MUCHO GUSTO, SENORA. I'M SURE I'LL BE ABLE TO COUNT THESE NEXT FEW DAYS AMONG MY MOST PLEASANT MEMORIES. APACHES, CAPTAIN. YEAH, THEY'RE APACHES, ALL RIGHT. I WONDER WHAT THEY WANT. A MEETIN' OF SOME KIND, I RECKON. COCHISE-- CHIEF OF THE APACHES, WISHES TO TALK TO CHIEF OF ALL THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS. HAVE COCHISE AND HIS FRIENDS APPROACH. BUT YOU HAVE MANY GUNS POINTED AT US. AS LONG AS THE APACHES DO NOTHING BUT TALK, THE GUNS WILL NOT BE USED. I HAVE COME TO TALK TO THE CHIEF OF YOUR SOLDIERS. MAJOR BURKE IS IN TUCSON. HE'LL RETURN IN SEVERAL DAYS. HE'S MOST ANXIOUS TO MEET THE GREAT CHIEF OF THE APACHES. IF COCHISE AND HIS FRIENDS WILL PERMIT, WE'LL TAKE YOU TO TUCSON NOW. THE STRONGHOLD OF THE MEXICANOS. WE CANNOT. THEY WILL TRAP US. KILL US. COCHISE, I PLEDGE MY WORD YOU'LL BE SAFE. AN ESCORT OF SOLDIERS WILL RIDE WITH YOU TO GIVE YOU FULL PROTECTION. THAT GUN. LET ME SEE IT. COME. LET US GO BACK. YOU MAY RETURN. I WILL GO WITH YOU TO SEE YOUR LEADER. HEY. THAT INDIAN. HE LOOKS LIKE AN APACHE. THAT'S COCHISE. HE'S SURE GOT HIS NERVE COMIN' IN HERE. HE'LL BE LUCKY IF SOME MEXICAN DON'T PUT A BULLET THROUGH HIM. HEY, IT'S COCHISE. AS SURE AS YOU'RE STANDIN' THERE. WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? STRING HIM UP, MAYBE? I WAS WITH GENERAL GADSDEN WHEN HE SENT MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE OFFERING PEACE TO THEIR CHIEF, LITTLE CROW. BUT THE YOUNG WARRIORS WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT. THEY WANTED WAR. DID THEY ATTACK? WE NEVER GAVE 'EM A CHANCE. WE CUT THEM OFF AT SALT FORK. THAT WAS THE END OF IT. WHAT HAPPENED TO LITTLE CROW? DID HE ASK FOR PEACE? PEACE? WHAT INDIANS EVER WANTED PEACE? I'M HOPING COCHISE WILL WANT IT. DON FRANCISCO. DON FRANCISCO. THERE ARE AMERICAN SOLDIERS OUTSIDE. ONE OF THEM WISHES TO SPEAK WITH MAJOR BURKE. I APOLOGIZE, SENOR. THIS IS UNEXPECTED. THERE IS NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE, SENOR. MY HOUSE IS YOURS. BRING IN THE SOLDIER WHO WANTS TO SEE MAJOR BURKE. I CAN SPEAK WITH HIM OUTSIDE. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. LAWSON. WHAT'S UP? GOT A BIG FISH RIGHT ON THE HOOK. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? DO YOU KNOW WHO'S OUT THERE? COURSE NOT. WHO? COCHISE. COCHISE? WHERE? AT DON FRANCISCO'S HOUSE. HE'S MEETING WITH BURKE. WHAT ARE THEY UP TO? I DON'T KNOW. PEACE WITH THE INDIANS MAYBE. WELL, WELL. PEACE, HUH? COULD BE A GOOD THING. FOR THE MEXICANS. SUPPOSE THEM INDIANS GOT OFF THE WAR PATH, AND STAYED OFF THE WAR PATH. COULD BE THAT WASHINGTON WILL HUSTLE THEIR SOLDIER BOYS BACK HOME. BUT I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. ONLY BE ANOTHER PEACE TREATY. BEEN 50 OF 'EM BEFORE AND 50 OF 'EM BROKEN. HEY, YOU CAN BANK ON IT. THIS WON'T BE NO EXCEPTION. DON FRANCISCO. I HAVE A REQUEST TO MAKE. AN UNUSUAL REQUEST. WHAT IS IT, SENOR? YOU SAID A FEW MOMENTS AGO THAT YOUR HOUSE IS MINE. I MEANT IT. THEN MAY I USE IT RIGHT NOW? THIS ROOM ONLY. FOR A TALK WITH SOMEONE VERY IMPORTANT. OF COURSE. WE SHALL GO UPSTAIRS UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED. TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU LIKE. JUST A MOMENT, SIR. I FEEL I SHOULD TELL YOU WHO THIS PERSON IS. NOT AT ALL, SENOR. YES, SIR. I MUST. YOU MAY NOT WANT HIM TO SET FOOT IN YOUR HOUSE. NOT SET FOOT IN MY HOUSE? IS HE-- FORGIVE ME, SENOR-- AN AMERICAN? NO. YES. YES. HE IS AN AMERICAN. HE IS COCHISE. COCHISE? YOU WOULD HAVE THAT SAVAGE A GUEST IN OUR HOUSE? DON FRANCISCO--NEVER. MY OFFICERS FEEL HE'S COME HERE TO DISCUSS PEACE. IF HE GIVES HIS WORD--THE WORD OF AN INDIAN? HAS HE EVER BROKEN IT? FRANCISCO, YOU MUST NOT ALLOW-- FELIPE. IF THERE IS A CHANCE FOR PEACE, THE ROOM IS YOURS, SENOR. I AM MAJOR BURKE, IN COMMAND OF THE AMERICAN TROOPS WHO ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY. WHY HAVE YOU COME? MY GOVERNMENT SENT ME HERE. ALL THIS LAND IS APACHE LAND. MANY YEARS. MANY LIFETIMES. WHEN THE MEXICANOSTRY TO TAKE IT FROM US, WE KILL MEXICANOS. THE APACHES ARE STRONG. SO ARE THE AMERICANS. THAT IS TRUE. FOR A LONG TIME, I HAVE WATCHED AMERICANS. SOMETIMES, I HAVE FOUGHT THEM. BUT NOT OFTEN. WHY NOT? THEY ALWAYS COME BACK. MORE OF THEM THAN BEFORE. AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE BETTER WEAPONS. IT DOES NO GOOD TO ATTACK THE AMERICANS. COCHISE IS WISE. ONE THING I MUST KNOW-- ARE YOU HERE FOR A SHORT TIME, OR ARE YOU HERE TO STAY? WE'RE HERE TO STAY. DON'T, FELIPE. PLEASE, DON'T. LET ME ALONE, YOU FOOL. NO, DON'T YOU BE THE FOOL. WHY DO YOU TRY TO STOP ME? DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE ONLY PROLONGING OUR AGONY? LOOK, FELIPE. I HAVE EVERY REASON TO HATE INDIANS JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO. BUT THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER. TODAY HAS GIVEN US HOPE. THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS. THIS GESTURE OF COCHISE. WE MUST GIVE IT A CHANCE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. YOU'VE STOPPED ME THIS TIME. BUT REMEMBER-- YES. WILL COCHISE, FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW RAIDS ON MEXICAN HACIENDAS, FORCE UPON HIS PEOPLE A WAR WITH THE AMERICANS? OR WILL HE BE FOR PEACE? I WILL BE FOR PEACE. BUT MY PEOPLE MAY BE FOR WAR. WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN? THEY WILL CHOOSE ANOTHER CHIEF. AND MAKE WAR. WHEN WILL I KNOW ABOUT THIS? BRING YOUR WARRIORS TO DONNELLY'S PASS SIX DAYS FROM NOW. AND WE WILL GIVE YOU OUR PLEDGE OF PEACE. OR WAR. AGREED. IT IS A CUSTOM OF OUR PEOPLE. THE HANDSHAKE. IT MEANS WE EACH GIVE OUR WORD TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID. UN MOMENTO. UN MOMENTO. SENOR MAJOR. WELCOME. I LIKE. SO DID A YOUNG LADY IN MEXICO CITY. DID YOU GET THE CHAMPAGNE? SI, SENOR. RIGHT HERE. CHILLED? SI. CHILLED. ANYONE ELSE HOME? NOT FOR ANOTHER HOUR. THAT SHOULD COVER IT. GRACIAS, SENOR. OH, AND GARCIA... YOU MAY HAVE THE NEXT HOUR OFF. WELL, GO ON. GO ON. YOU WERE YOUNG ONCE, WEREN'T YOU? SENOR... I AM STILL YOUNG. I LIKE. COME IN. GOOD EVENING, MAJOR BURKE. GOOD EVENING. FOR ME? YES. I JUST PICKED IT UP. I KNOW. I BOUGHT IT IN SONORA. WELL, THERE ARE NO FLORISTS IN TUCSON. MAJOR, YOU BELONG IN AN EMBASSY. IN PARIS OR LISBON. SIT DOWN, WON'T YOU? THANK YOU. YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU? OH, NO. COURSE NOT. THAT'S LOVELY. YOU KNOW, I... I NEVER EXPECTED TO FIND SO BEAUTIFUL A WOMAN HERE IN TUCSON. YOU KNOW, I NEVER EXPECTED-- IF YOU ARE REFERRING TO ME, THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. I AM. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHAMPAGNE? WHY, YES. THANK YOU. WELL. THE GLASSES ARE RIGHT OVER THERE. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. GET THE CHAMPAGNE? WHY, IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO. NO. I MEAN, ASK GARCIA TO LEAVE. OH. THAT. WELL, UH... WELL, YOU SEE... ACTUALLY, WHAT HAPPENED... OF COURSE I SEE. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A TACTICAL PROBLEM WE NEVER COVERED AT WEST POINT. MAYBE I OUGHTA TAKE MY CHAMPAGNE AND GO HOME. MAJOR. WE COULD HAVE A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE. EVEN THE CHAMPAGNE HAS GONE FLAT. COCHISE HAS TOLD ONLY THAT HE DOES NOT WANT TO FIGHT A WAR WITH THE WHITE EYES. HAS HE FORGOTTEN THAT IF WE DO WHAT HE SAYS, WE MAY HAVE TO FIGHT A WAR WITH THE COMANCHES? FOR MANY YEARS, THE COMANCHES HAVE RIDDEN DOWN THROUGH OUR PLAINS TO MAKE THEIR OWN RAIDS UPON THE MEXICANOS. IF WE TRY TO FORBID THEM NOW, IT WOULD MEAN WAR WITH THEM. I WAIT FOR COCHISE TO ANSWER. I WILL ANSWER TUKIWAH WITH VERY FEW WORDS. I AM YOUR CHIEF. I HAVE CONSIDERED ALL THESE THINGS. I DO NOT THINK IT WILL MEAN WAR WITH THE COMANCHES. BUT IF IT DOES... THAT WILL BE BETTER THAN WAR WITH THE AMERICANS. IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO, MAJOR, I'D HAVE BEEN MORE COMFORTABLE ON MY HORSE. SO WOULD I. THAT WON'T IMPRESS THE INDIANS. THEY'VE ALL GOT HORSES. WHAT IF THEY REFUSE OUR PROPOSAL? IF IT'S WAR, WE'RE IN A NICE SPOT TO END IT QUICK. WE'LL KNOW IN A FEW MINUTES, BILL. RELAX. IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I STAY TENSE? YOUR WARRIORS AND MINE MEET FACE TO FACE. WE HAVE MANY MORE WARRIORS. IF ALL OF MY MEN WERE KILLED, MORE WOULD BE SENT. MORE AND THEN MORE. IF ALL OF YOUR WARRIORS WERE KILLED, COULD YOU REPLACE THEM? LET THERE BE NO MORE TALK OF KILLING. THE PLEDGE WILL BE FOR BOTH SIDES. IN THE LAND OF THE APACHE, THERE WILL BE NO MORE KILLING. IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU AND YOUR MEN TO ACCOMPANY US TO THE BORDER, MAJOR BURKE. HAPPY TO DO IT, SENOR. I THINK YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE NOW THAT COCHISE HAS GIVEN HIS WORD. YOU HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE WORD OF AN INDIAN. IN THIS INDIAN. I PRAY YOU ARE RIGHT, SENOR. FOR IF HIS WORD IS NOT GOOD, ALL OUR LIVES ARE FORFEIT. I'M SORRY YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ME THE OTHER NIGHT. I THINK IT WAS YOU WHO MISUNDERSTOOD ME. I'M SORRY HOWEVER IT WAS. I'LL MAKE A TREATY WITH YOU. YOU NAME THE TERMS. THAT WE DON'T DISCUSS IT AGAIN. DID I EVER TELL YOU THE MEANING OF THE HANDSHAKE? I WISH ALL MY NEGOTIATIONS WERE THIS SIMPLE. WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR. YES. WELL, I HOPE IT WORKS OUT. I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL IT WILL. DID YOU EVER TELL YOUR FATHER ABOUT SAVING COCHISE'S LIFE? NO. NOT YET. I THINK SOMEDAY HE MAY BE VERY PROUD OF YOU FOR IT. OR HE MAY NEVER FORGIVE ME FOR STOPPING FELIPE. AND FELIPE-- HOW DOES HE FEEL? OH, I DON'T THINK HE WILL EVER CHANGE. HE REFUSED TO COME WITH US. HE IS STAYING IN TUCSON. I HOPE OUR BEING BELOW THE BORDER WON'T KEEP US FROM SEEING YOU. I AM SURE IT WON'T. MAJOR. TREATY. HERE WE MUST LEAVE YOU, DON FRANCISCO. I'M SORRY. I AM TOO, SENOR. BUT WON'T YOU CALL UPON US SOON? AS A FRIEND. MY HACIENDA'S JUST OVER THE NEXT RISE. YOU'RE VERY KIND, SENOR. I SHALL MAKE A POINT OF IT. VERY SOON. WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR VISIT, SENOR. ADIOS. NO MORE KILLING. IT IS AN ORDER HE GIVES US, THE MIGHTY COCHISE. US, THE COMANCHES, WHO FEAR NO MAN, WHITE OR RED. FOR MANY YEARS, WE HAVE SENT WAR PARTIES INTO THE LAND OF THE MEXICANOS TO FIND THE HORSES WE NEED FOR HUNTING THE BUFFALO. AND TO GIVE OUR YOUNG MEN EXPERIENCE IN WAR. I, RUNNING COUGAR, SAY WE SHOULD CONTINUE AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. MY BROTHER, RUNNING COUGAR, IS A VERY BRAVE YOUNG MAN. AND A VERY GREAT FOOL. HE SPEAKS OF HORSES. OUR HERDS ARE LARGE ENOUGH NOW FOR THE NATURAL INCREASE TO GIVE US ALL WE NEED. HE SPEAKS OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO WANT EXPERIENCE IN WAR AGAINST THE MEXICANOS. THEY WILL NOW BE MAKING WAR ON COCHISE AND THE APACHES. IN THEIR OWN LAND... WHERE THEY KNOW EVERY AMBUSH AND TRAP. THESE ARE THE THOUGHTS OF RED KNIFE. HAS ANYONE MORE TO SAY? LET WHITE WATER SPEAK HIS THOUGHTS. IT IS MY THOUGHT THAT RUNNING COUGAR IS VERY BRAVE, AND THAT PERHAPS COCHISE IS NOT QUITE SO BRAVE AS HE ONCE WAS. IT IS MY THOUGHT THAT IF COCHISE MAKES WAR ON RUNNING COUGAR, HIS OWN SCALP WILL SOON DANGLE AT A COMANCHE TROPHY BELT. IF WHITE WATER THINKS COCHISE IS NO LONGER BRAVE, PERHAPS HE WILL KILL COCHISE. PERHAPS HE WILL. PERHAPS I WILL. YOU WISE OLD MEN MAY SIT AND TALK, BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO RAID THE MEXICANOS AS I ALWAYS HAVE. AND ALL THE YOUNG MEN WILL GO WITH ME. THOSE WHO DO NOT FEAR COCHISE. THEY'VE COME, DON FRANCISCO. THE INDIANS. INDIANS? A WAR PARTY? YES. THEY HAVE ALREADY DESTROYED THE RANCHES OF DON MANUELITA AND DON MIGUEL. THOSE WHO DIDN'T ESCAPE WERE KILLED. THAT'S BECAUSE WE TOOK THE WORD OF AN INDIAN. GARCIA. GET THE HORSES. NEVER MIND THE HORSES. GET THE RIFLES. GET INTO THE HOUSE. LOCK YOURSELVES IN YOUR ROOMS. ANOTHER WAR PARTY. FATHER. BACK. BACK INTO THE HOUSE. BUT THIS IS COCHISE. COMANCHES COME HERE AGAINST THE WILL OF COCHISE. FOR THE APACHES, I SPEAK. THEY WILL DO NO HARM. FOR THE COMANCHES, I CANNOT SPEAK. I SPEAK FOR RED KNIFE, CHIEF OF THE COMANCHES, WHO SENT ME HERE TO GIVE HIS SAYING TO COCHISE AND THE OTHER WARRIORS OF THE APACHE NATION. SPEAK. THE SAYING OF RED KNIFE IS THIS-- COCHISE HAS KILLED RUNNING COUGAR, THE BROTHER OF RED KNIFE. AND HIS HEART IS HARDENED AGAINST COCHISE. NO LONGER WILL RED KNIFE TELL HIS PEOPLE THEY MUST KEEP THE NEW LAW OF THE APACHES. IF THE APACHES TRY TO STOP US, IT WILL MEAN WAR BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS. IF RED KNIFE DOES WHAT HE KNOWS WILL BRING WAR, RED KNIFE WILL GET WAR. COCHISE MAY DESIRE A WAR WITH THE COMANCHES. MANY OTHERS OF US DO NOT. DOES TUKIWAH FEAR WAR? TUKIWAH FEARS NOTHING. BUT IF THERE IS TO BE A WAR, LET IT BE AGAINST THE WHITES. WE HAVE NO QUARREL WITH THE COMANCHES. I HAVE HEARD THE VOICE OF TUKIWAH. DO I HEAR ANY OTHER VOICES? I ADD MY VOICE TO TUKIWAH. COCHISE HAS HEARD HIS PEOPLE. I WILL THINK ABOUT IT AND GIVE YOU MY ANSWER WHEN THE LONG SHADOWS FALL. TERUA. I HEARD. THERE WILL BE A BATTLE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY BATTLES. THERE WILL BE MANY MORE. I CANNOT HELP WONDERING WHY IT MUST BE SO. BUT I'M ONLY A WOMAN. YES. YOU ARE ONLY A WOMAN. MY WOMAN. YOU DO NOT WANT WAR WITH THE WHITE MAN? NO. THEN DO NOT DO IT. YOU ARE CHIEF OF THE APACHES. SOMETIMES, THE WILL OF HIS PEOPLE IS STRONGER THAN THE WILL OF THEIR CHIEF. THEY HAVE OPPOSED YOU BEFORE, AND FOUND THAT YOU WERE RIGHT. I WILL GO TO TUCSON TO SEE MAJOR BURKE. I MUST TELL HIM I CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACTIONS OF THE COMANCHES. WE MUST WORK OUT THE PROBLEM TOGETHER. WHAT ABOUT YOUR ANSWER TO RED KNIFE? IT WILL WAIT. YOU MUST READY YOURSELF. I? YES. YOU ARE GOING WITH ME. IT WILL SHOW THEM WHAT IS IN MY HEART. I WILL GO TELL THE COUNCIL. NOT BAD, MR. MADDOCK. NOT BAD AT ALL. IT'LL BE BETTER. IF THERE'S ANYTHING AROUND TO BUY, THE SOLDIER BOYS WILL BUY IT. THEY SURE LIKE TO DRINK. THAT MUCH I CAN TELL YOU. AND WHEN THEY DRINK, THEY LIKE TO TALK. DO YOU THINK THEY'LL STAY LONG? YEAH. AS LONG AS THERE'S INDIANS TO FIGHT. WHAT ABOUT THIS PEACE? I HEARD ONE OF THEM SOLDIERS SAY THAT COCHISE WAS COMIN' HERE. AND HE'S SURE PALS WITH THAT BURKE. I GOT A HUNCH THAT WON'T LAST LONG. THIS'LL LOOK KIND OF NICE ON THE WIFE. GO AHEAD, LINK. NO ONE NEEDS YOU ANYMORE TONIGHT. RIGHT, MR. MADDOCK. THANKS. GOOD NIGHT. YEAH. SENOR FELIPE. GLAD YOU COULD COME. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, SENOR. WHAT ABOUT? NOW, LOOK. I THINK WE HAVE SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS TO CLEAR UP. IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT, I WILL NOT STAY. THAT ISN'T WHY I SENT FOR YOU. I TOLD YOU I HAD SOMETHING INTERESTING TO TELL YOU. OF COURSE, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT-- WHAT IS IT? COCHISE IS COMING. COCHISE? YEAH. COMING HERE TO SEE BURKE. MORE PEACE TALKS. PEACE. THE PEACE WAS SO SUCCESSFUL THAT MY BROTHER-IN-LAW AND HIS FAMILY HAD TO FLEE AGAIN FROM MEXICO. OH. THEY'RE BACK IN TUCSON? THEY WILL BE TONIGHT. HERE, SENOR. SOLDIER BOYS GET CARELESS AROUND WOMEN, AND THEY LEAVE THINGS. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO USE THIS... ON COCHISE? I HAVE MY OWN GUN. IT KILLS JUST AS WELL. BUT WITH THIS I PROMISE YOU IT WILL CAUSE MANY MORE THAN ONE INDIAN TO BE KILLED. WHY DO YOU GIVE THIS TO ME? BECAUSE YOU MEXICANS ARE THE ONES WITH EVERYTHING TO GAIN. THEY'RE NOT BOTHERING US. WE GOT A TREATY. HAS COCHISE HAD ENOUGH? DO YOU STILL WANT TO FIGHT COMANCHES, AND NOT AMERICAN SOLDIERS? MY HEART GRIEVES OVER WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THEN LET US START THE WAR CHANTS. TOGETHER WITH RED KNIFE, WE CAN DESTROY THEM ALL. NO, TUKIWAH. IF WE ARE WRONG, WE CAN ONLY DESTROY OURSELVES. MERELY BECAUSE OF THIS GUN, I DO NOT THINK THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS HAVE BROKEN THEIR WORD. CAN YOU TELL ME THIS AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED? YOUR OWN TERUA. SHE WAS MORE THAN MY TERUA. SHE WAS AN APACHE. A PART OF MY PEOPLE. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO PRESERVE. WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO? TO BRING MAJOR BURKE HERE. HE MUST PROVE IT WAS NOT AN AMERICAN SOLDIER WHO ATTACKED US. IF HE CANNOT... WE WILL FIGHT THE AMERICANS. IF THEY HAVE BROKEN THE TREATY, DO YOU THINK MAJOR BURKE WILL BE FOOL ENOUGH TO COME HERE? NO. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WAY. WE WILL FORCE HIM TO COME HERE. HOW? YOU WILL BRING BACK A HOSTAGE. SOMEONE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO MAKE MAJOR BURKE COME HERE ALONE. YOU WILL ORGANIZE A RAIDING PARTY TONIGHT. GO NOW, TUKIWAH. I MUST MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY TERUA. STILL WATER. PONCEY. GET THE HORSES READY. SENOR FELIPE. I'VE BEEN WAITIN' FOR YOU SINCE LAST NIGHT. MY HORSE BOLTED. WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW. I COULD NOT SEE. WHERE'S THE GUN? I LEFT IT THERE. I'M SORRY. NO. NO, THAT'S GOOD. WHAT'S THAT? WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO WITH ME? WHY AM I HERE? TAKE ME TO COCHISE. COCHISE WOULD NEVER PERMIT THIS. COCHISE. COCHISE. COCHISE. I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW ABOUT TERUA? YES. YOU MUST NEVER BE SORRY. PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH US HAVE GONE TO ANOTHER LIFE. ONE THAT IS MUCH RICHER THAN OURS. WHERE THERE IS NO SICKNESS, PAIN, DEATH, OR SORROW. WE WISH THEM WELL, AND THEN NEVER THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN. I WILL START FROM THE BEGINNING NOW, AS IF TERUA NEVER EXISTED. I MUST TELL YOU HOW SHE DIED BECAUSE THAT IS WHY YOU ARE HERE. WITH PEACE IN OUR HEARTS, COCHISE AND HIS TERUA WERE COMING TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR MAJOR BURKE. WE WERE AMBUSHED BY AN AMERICAN SOLDIER. AN AMERICAN SOLDIER? THAT IS WHAT MY PEOPLE THINK. AND YOU? COCHISE IS NOT POSITIVE. MAJOR BURKE TAUGHT ME THE SHAKE OF THE HAND. THEN WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE? I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS TO BE YOU. I ASKED ONLY FOR A HOSTAGE. ONE WHO WOULD BRING YOUR MAJOR BURKE HERE TO THE APACHES. BUT I SEE TUKIWAH WAS WISE, AND HIS WISDOM BROUGHT ME MAJOR BURKE'S WOMAN. WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO WITH ME? YOU WILL REMAIN HERE. UNTIL MAJOR BURKE CAN PRODUCE THE MAN WHO KILLED TERUA, OR PROVE TO MY PEOPLE THAT THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS DID NOT BREAK THEIR HANDSHAKE. IF IT WILL MEAN PEACE, THEN I WILL GLADLY DO WHAT I CAN. WE WILL TRY TO MEND OUR DIFFERENCES QUICKLY. COCHISE DOES NOT WANT YOU TO STAY HERE LONGER THAN NECESSARY. RIGHT OUT THERE'S WHERE THE MURDERER ATTACKED ME. MUST HAVE COME OVER THE WALL AFTER THAT. THIS OUTRAGE HAS HAD ONE GOOD RESULT. IT HAS UNITED US. AMERICANS. MEXICANS. TOGETHER, WE'RE RAISING A BAND TO FIND THIS APACHE DEVIL, WHOEVER HE IS, AND KILL HIM. IF YOU TRY THAT, THE FIRST TO DIE WILL BE CONSUELO. SHE'S DEAD ALREADY. ALL WE CAN HOPE FOR NOW IS REVENGE. I DON'T THINK SHE'S DEAD. IF SHE IS, I'LL HELP YOU GET YOUR REVENGE. SENOR, FOR HER SAKE, I HOPE SHE IS DEAD. THERE MUST BE A REASON FOR THIS. I DON'T BELIEVE COCHISE WOULD BREAK HIS WORD. I'LL CONTACT COCHISE. I'LL SEE HIM MYSELF. MAJOR, YOU CAN'T GO UP THERE. IF THE TREATY IS BROKEN, THEY'LL KILL YOU TOO. THEN YOU ORGANIZE THE ATTACK. A SINGLE ARROW. HE IS ALONE. I WILL GO TO MEET HIM. IF THE TREATY IS BROKEN, WE WILL HAVE NO USE FOR THE HANDSHAKE. THE TREATY IS NOT BROKEN. NOT BY US. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? IT WAS USED TO KILL MY WOMAN. THEY TRIED TO KILL ME. WHERE? HOW? THAT IS FOR YOU TO ANSWER. MY WOMAN AND I WERE ON OUR WAY TO SEE YOU. TO TALK OF OUR PROBLEMS-- YOU MUST TAKE MY WORD. I KNOW NOTHING OF THIS. WHERE'S CONSUELO? SHE IS SAFE. WE BROUGHT HER HERE SO THAT YOU WOULD COME. THEN I'LL TAKE HER BACK WITH ME. NO. SHE WILL REMAIN UNTIL YOU SHOW THAT IT WAS NOT AN AMERICAN SOLDIER WHO ATTACKED US.I TELL YOU IT WAS NOT. IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE NOW WHAT YOU TELL ME. IT MUST BE PROVEN TO MY PEOPLE. AND IF I CAN'T BRING YOU THAT PROOF? THEN WE WILL REGARD THE TREATY AS BROKEN. THE APACHES HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN MANY TIMES BEFORE. I WILL GIVE YOU FOUR DAYS TO SHOW THAT YOU HAVE KEPT YOUR WORD. IF YOU CANNOT... THE APACHES AND THE COMANCHES WILL MAKE WAR ON THE WHITES. THIS TIME, TO THE FINISH. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO CONSUELO? MY PEOPLE WILL DECIDE THAT. FOUR DAYS. COCHISE. THANK YOU. I HAVE SEEN YOUR MAJOR BURKE. WHERE IS HE? HAS HE GONE? I TOLD HIM WHY YOU ARE HERE AND WHAT HE MUST DO. YOUR PURPOSE HAS BEEN SERVED THEN. AM I TO GO BACK WITH HIM? YOU ARE TO STAY. OH. HE IS ALREADY ON HIS WAY BACK. I PROMISED HIM NO HARM WILL COME TO YOU. BUT I CANNOT HOLD MY PEOPLE BEYOND FOUR DAYS. IF MAJOR BURKE FAILS, MY PEOPLE WILL FORCE ME TO MAKE WAR. THAT IS MUCH BETTER. BUT LET ME CAUTION YOU. THIS TARGET WITH ITS PAINT IS VERY TAME. NOT SO WITH OUR ENEMIES. WHEN YOU HUNT ANYTHING, MAN OR ANIMAL, YOU WILL HAVE TO GO SLYLY. AND CAREFULLY. AS IF YOU WERE A FOX. AND YOU WILL HAVE TO STRIKE FAST AND HARD. OTHERWISE, HE WILL STRIKE AT YOU. LOOK OVER THERE. OH, SOMEONE WILL SURELY GET HURT. ONE WILL BE HURT ONLY IF HE'S NOT LEARNED HIS LESSON WELL. THESE BOYS ARE TAUGHT EARLY THAT NO ONE WILL HELP THEM IN THIS WORLD. THEY MUST RELY ON NO ONE. NOT THEIR SISTER, MOTHER, OR FATHER. ONLY THEIR BRAIN AND EYESIGHT IS THEIR FRIEND. THEIR HANDS AND LEGS ARE THEIR FRIENDS. WHEN YOU GROW UP, YOU LIVE WITH THESE THINGS AND THINK ABOUT THEM. IS EVERYONE TAUGHT THIS WAY? EVERYONE. BOYS AND GIRLS. SEE THOSE? OVER THERE? THESE YOUNG ONES ARE BEING TAUGHT DISCIPLINE AND ENDURANCE. THEY ALL START OUT RUNNING. NOT FULL SPEED, BUT TROTTING. SOMEWHERE ALONG THE ROAD, A BRAVE, WITH WATER IN A LITTLE CONTAINER, GIVES IT TO THE RUNNER AND SAYS, "TAKE A MOUTHFUL BUT DO NOT SWALLOW IT." THEY RUN FOUR MILES WITH THE WATER IN THEIR MOUTHS. AT THE END OF THE COURSE, EACH IS INSPECTED. TO SEE IF HE STILL HAS THE WATER. IF ONE HAS SWALLOWED, THE TRAINERS SEE TO IT HE DOES NOT DO IT A SECOND TIME. IT IS NO WONDER YOUR WARRIORS ARE SO HEARTY. THEY HAVE TO BE. SURVIVAL IS OUR RELIGION. AT NIGHT, WE TELL TIME BY THE BIG DIPPER. AS ITS STARS SPIN AROUND, THEY TELL US THE PASSAGE OF THE NIGHT. SEE, THERE. THE STAR THAT IS RIGHT STRAIGHT UP. WE CALL IT "ROCK BED." AFTER THE ROCKS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE MESCAL PIT. WE SEE IT EVERY SUMMER. OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. DO ALL YOUR SUMMERS FEEL THIS WAY? ALWAYS. ESPECIALLY NEAR THE TURN OF THE MOON. WHEN THEY ARE ALONE, THEIR FINGERS WILL TOUCH THEIR EYES. I KNOW. IT IS THE KISS OF YOUR PEOPLE. THEY WILL BE MARRIED BY THE NEXT FULL MOON. AND THE NEXT FULL MOON IS TOMORROW. WHY DOES HE TURN HIS BACK ON HER? DOESN'T HE LIKE HER? THIS IS THE MOTHER OF HIS BRIDE. OUR CUSTOM FORBIDS THE HUSBAND TO TALK TO HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW. EVER. HOW STRANGE. IN SOME WAYS, THE CUSTOM OF THE APACHE IS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE WHITE. THE FEAST OF THE MARRIAGE TAKES THREE DAYS. THE MAN AND HIS WOMAN MUST REMAIN JUST AS YOU SEE THEM. THEY SELDOM SEE OR SPEAK TO EACH OTHER. SOMETIMES, IT IS EASIER FOR THE HEART TO DO THE TALKING. BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY FOR THE HEART TO MAKE ITSELF UNDERSTOOD. I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME OF YOUR PEOPLE. BUT MORE IMPORTANT IS WHAT I HAVE LEARNED OF YOU. YOU HAVE LEARNED WELL, CONSUELO. I HAVE LEARNED ALL OF YOUR CUSTOMS. THIS IS THE WAY OF MY PEOPLE. I THINK PERHAPS THERE ARE CUSTOMS OF YOURS SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF OURS. FOURTH DAY DRAWS NEAR. MAJOR BURKE HAS NOT COME. I MUST MEET WITH THE COMANCHES TO TALK OF WAR. I HAVE SEEN YOU BE KIND. GENTLE. UNDERSTANDING. YOU MUST NOT DO IT. ONCE BEFORE, A WOMAN TOLD ME THAT. BUT I AM STILL LEADER OF THE APACHES. COCHISE. COMANCHES. THEY CAMP BEYOND THE RIVER. THEY WANT WAR TALK. LET THEM COME TO US. NO. THEY ARE ON APACHE LAND. LET US SHOW THEM HOW FAST WE CAN GO TO THEM. RED MEN SHOULD NOT FIGHT RED MEN. WE HAVE BUT ONE ENEMY. THE WHITES. THREE SHADOWS HAVE FALLEN SINCE MAJOR BURKE LEFT. TOMORROW, WE WILL START OUR WAR DANCES. THE NEXT DAY, WE WILL STRIKE. FOR EACH AMERICAN WARRIOR HERE, THE COMANCHES HAVE THREE. WITH APACHES JOINING US, WE WILL KILL THEM ALL. TOM? COME IN. THE RIFLE BELONGED TO A CORPORAL NAMED CARTER. GOOD. WHERE'D HE LEAVE IT?MADDOCK'S. HE GOT DRUNK THERE, THEN TOOK OFF. LET'S GO TO WORK. BRING CARTER IN. RIGHT. WAIT A MINUTE. DON'T BRING HIM IN. WHAT DO WE ACCOMPLISH BY THAT? WELL, AT LEAST WE'LL KNOW--WHAT DO WE KNOW? IT WAS CARTER'S RIFLE. HE LEFT IT AT MADDOCK'S. WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US? YEAH. WE CAN'T EVEN ASK MADDOCK. THIS IS THE THIRD DAY. TOMORROW, IT WON'T MATTER. WE'LL BE FIGHTING FOR OUR OWN LIVES. THERE'S ONE SHOT. I JUST GOT AN IDEA. WHAT'S THAT? FELIPE. WASN'T HE WITH MADDOCK THE NIGHT OF THE RAID? IT IS INSANE WHAT YOU PROPOSE. SENOR,I KNOW YOU TRIED IT ONCE BEFORE. CONSUELO TOLD ME. LIES. ALL OF THEM LIES. IT'S NO LIE YOU WERE WITH MADDOCK WHEN HE WAS KILLED. AND IT'S NO LIE YOU HATED COCHISE. WHY DO YOU WASTE MY TIME? GO BACK TO YOUR SOLDIERS. FELIPE. DO YOU WANT CONSUELO KILLED? WHY DO YOU ASK ME ABOUT KILLING? I'VE SEEN MORE THAN A LIFETIME OF IT. DON'T YOU WANT THAT TO STOP? IT WILL NEVER STOP. NOT SO LONG AS ONE INDIAN LIVES. YOU'RE WRONG, FELIPE. COCHISE WANTS IT STOPPED. I WANT IT STOPPED. THE DREAM YOU HAVE. IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. THINK OF CONSUELO. INDIANS ARE VINDICTIVE IF THEY THINK THEY'RE RIGHT. THEY CAN BE CRUEL. GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE. THEY HAVE TORCHES. GET OUT. THEY HANG A MAN TO A TREE BY THE SKIN OF HIS STOMACH. IF YOU DON'T GET OUT--CUT PATTERNS WITH KNIVES. MUTILATE BEYOND RECOGNITION. CONSUELO IS UP THERE WITH THEM. THEY WOULDN'T HESITATE. YOU'RE THE CAUSE OF CONSUELO'S TROUBLES. YOU AND YOUR TREATIES. FELIPE. COME WITH ME TO COCHISE. NO. NO. AND BE TORN TO PIECES? I GUARANTEE YOU A FAIR TRIAL. AFRAID? SOMETIMES COCHISE MAKES ME AFRAID. YOU MUST NEVER BE AFRAID. WE HAVE CAPTURED TWO WHITE MEN. ONE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE. THEIR LEADER OF THE WHITE WARRIORS. MAJOR BURKE. LET HIM COME IN. CONSUELO. I HAVE YOUR PROOF. WHERE? OUTSIDE. COME WITH ME. TELL HIM. EVERYTHING. WHAT IS THERE TO TELL? I TRIED TO KILL YOU. I'M SORRY FOR YOUR WIFE. IS IT THE WORD OF THIS MAN ALONE? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT ME TO ACCEPT? YES. ONCE BEFORE, HE TRIED TO TAKE YOUR LIFE. IT IS THE TRUTH. I KNOW IT IS. THE WAR DANCE WILL STOP. NOW. I ACCEPT YOUR PROOF. THE APACHES WILL NOT MAKE WAR ON YOUR PEOPLE. AND THE COMANCHES? I MUST TRY TO TURN THEM ASIDE. BUT IF YOU CAN'T? WILL THE APACHES FIGHT WITH US AGAINST THEM? I DO NOT KNOW. I ONLY SAY THE APACHES WILL KEEP PEACE WITH THE AMERICANS. AND THE MEXICANOS. AND NOW, YOU WILL TURN THIS MAN OVER TO ME. NO, COCHISE. HE'S MY PRISONER. DO YOU THINK MY PEOPLE WILL ALLOW ME TO AGREE TO THIS? I ASK YOU TO AGREE. IN MY COUNTRY, WE HAVE COURTS. I PROMISED THIS MAN A FAIR TRIAL IF HE'D COME WITH ME IN THE INTEREST OF ALL OF US. WHAT ASSURANCE DO I HAVE THAT THIS WILL BE? MY ASSURANCE. I GUARANTEE IT. I'LL GO BACK TO TUCSON. MY TROOPS WILL BE ALERTED. I WILL DO MY BEST WITH RED KNIFE. CONSUELO WILL GO WITH ME. I HOLD YOU NO LONGER. YOU ARE FREE TO GO. NO, MAJOR. I AM GOING TO STAY HERE. I WILL SEE RED KNIFE, AND RETURN TO YOU BEFORE SUN UP. FELIPE. FELIPE. THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR WAR WITH THE AMERICANS. I HAVE JUST LEARNED THIS. THEY DID NOT BREAK THEIR PLEDGE TO THE APACHES. WE CANNOT BREAK OUR PLEDGE TO THEM. IT WAS YOU WHO TOLD US THEY BROKE THEIR PLEDGE. I WAS WRONG. THE TRUTH HAS NOW BEEN SHOWN TO ME. COCHISE SETS GREAT STORE BY HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICANS. WHAT OF HIS PROMISE TO THE COMANCHES? NOW, IT CANNOT BE MADE. YOU HAVE GONE FAR ENOUGH. YOU WILL SUFFER THREE DEATHS. ONE FOR MY BROTHER, RUNNING COUGAR, ONE FOR MY OTHER WARRIORS KILLED BY APACHES, AND THE LAST IS FOR YOURSELF. SO THAT NO MORE WILL YOU INTERFERE BETWEEN RED MAN AND RED MAN IN THEIR WAR AGAINST THE WHITES. THE FIRST DEATH WILL BE THE DEATH OF THE BOILING SPRING. THE SECOND DEATH WILL BE THE DEATH OF KNIVES. THE LAST DEATH WILL BE THE DEATH OF FIRE. THEY ARE TOO MANY. MAYBE SO, BUT WE HAD TO TRY. HOW DID YOU KNOW? CONSUELO GOT WORRIED SINCE YOU DIDN'T RETURN THIS MORNING. I TOLD YOU. TOO MANY. LOOK. THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND HAS GIVEN ME HEALING. SOON, YOU WILL BE WELL AGAIN. SOON, THERE WILL BE THE TURN OF THE MOON. NO, CONSUELO. FOR US, THERE WILL BE NO NEXT MOON. WHY? COCHISE, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WITH A CHANCE NOW FOR PEACE, I KNOW HOW MUCH MY PEOPLE NEED ME. THEY WILL NEVER PERMIT IT. ONCE YOU SAID IT WAS BETTER FOR THE HEART TO DO THE SPEAKING. IF WE WERE TO LISTEN TO THE HEART, WE WOULD HAVE TO GO AWAY. AND WE WILL NOT DO THAT BECAUSE I WILL NOT HAVE YOU LIVE THE LIFE OF A RENEGADE. AND WE CANNOT STAY HERE. WHY NOT? THE LAWS OF THE APACHE ARE VERY STRICT. AND A CHIEF, ABOVE ALL ELSE, MUST LIVE BY THEM. AND MARRY WITHIN HIS PEOPLE. GO BACK TO TUCSON WITH MAJOR BURKE. I RESPECT YOUR LAW, AND WHAT COCHISE MEANS TO YOU. COCHISE. THERE IS NO LAW THAT A CHIEF MUST MARRY WITHIN HIS PEOPLE. I KNOW.
