You fight one bean, you fight the whole burrito, huh? ¡Quita! You got your shit set? Just make sure your fucking tacojockeys don't fuck it up. Don't test me, cabron. You know, normally, I'd slit your throat for less. But seeing as we're business partners, I think I'll let it slide. Just remember one thing. You're not the only one that's good at slitting throats. Now, I paid you a lot offucking money to help put this together. So the shit better come good like clockwork next week. Don't you worry, Chavez. I won't burn you. Money is money. It makes the world go round. Oh. I'm not worried, but we all know how you like to burn things. Firebug. [ Chuckles ] [ Buzzer Buzzes ] [ Man ] All right, keep moving. [ Man ] Let's go, guys. Man, he is an idiot. I'm just telling you what he told me. Hey. Late on your last day? Farmerwill probably write your ass up for it too. He can write all he wants. Damn, Nate, those are some expensive-looking threads. You got to dress for success, Walter. Nate, I wasjust telling Walter here how Sergeant Farmer was saying... you're probablyjust gonna flunk out in your first semester anyway. Oh! Nice. I really care what he thinks. Ah, by the way, warden wants to see you. He says we got a transfer tonight. Oh, man, I just wanna have a peaceful shift and go home, not go on a goddamn road trip. I'll see you out there, man. See ya. [ Man On P.A. ] Cell Block "A"— prisoners, clear the yard. Clear the yard. You wanted to see me, Warden? Nate. - You know Willy here, don't you? - A prisoner from Cell Block 3. WillyJuarez is actually U.S. Marshal WilliamJuarez. This is Marshal Davis. They're gonna help us out with the Hazelton transfer, specifically with Carlo Chavez. That transfer isn't supposed to happen until next week. Yeah, well, I pushed it to tonight. Our friends here got word... that Chavez's gang may attempt to break him out during the transfer. We putJuarez undercover to try and find out who he's passing the information through. You chain him up next to Chavez on the bus. Nate, onlyyou will know my real identity in case ofan incident. Now, for this to work, Chavez has to trust me. [ Warden ] As an added precaution, I've altered your route. Nobody knows it but the people in this room. I'm counting on you, Nate. [ Door Opens ] Thanks, Ally. No problem, boss. ♪♪ [ Radio: Country ] [ Phone Rings ] Sheriff's station. Deputy Lane speaking. Yeah. When? What type ofvehicle were they driving? Ye-Yeah.

They probably stayed over so they could camp a little longer. - I'll take a drive out there. - I can do that, Sheriff. You don't have to. No. It's fine. I could use the fresh air. Come on, Leon! [ Dog Barking ] [ Inmate ] Hey, come on! Hey! [ Key Rattling ] [ Inmates Speaking, Indistinct ] What the fuck do you want? We're going on a bus ride, Mr. Chavez. - What, now? - Yeah, now.

We'll have it boxed up and shipped. Let's move, Chavez. Touch me again, I'll break your fuckin' fingers. Just move your ass before I lose my patience. Oh, no, you don't. No. You're not chaining that murderer next to me. Shut up, Crawford. Let's get Chavez up front followed by Juarez here and then the rest of'em. What's your problem? My problem is I don't wanna be chained to a whackjob... who went all post-traumatic stress on some poor asshole in a bar. I mean, what-what-what— You know, couldn't hack the war, soldier boy? Huh? Can't handle your liquor? Listen. I pushed the guy. He fell. And he hit his head. Okay? I'm innocent. - Yeah. So am I. - And so is everyone else in here. Never trust a con, huh? I'm not buying your bullshit, soldier boy. I heard you had your hands all up in the cash register. Just leave me alone. Oh, now. Soldier boy wants to be left alone. Oh! She had what? You get a "DearJohn" letter? Yeah. Yeah, went psycho... when you found out yourwife was fucking a real marine, you punk-ass bitch? That's enough. Shut up. Man, I'm just saying, I don't wanna be chained to a murderer. I mean, at least stealing cars, that's an honorable trade. Jesus Christ, Crawford. Floyd over here killed three people that we know about. - That-That's different, man. Floyd's my friend. -Just get moving! [ Walter] Keep it moving. [ Nate ] Get out ofthe way. Move. Watch your step. Here are the transfers. Gas up here. The sheriffwill be told you're coming 20 minutes before you're scheduled to arrive. - Stupid shit, making us go all night. - [ Snoring ] Fucking bullshit! Don't you think? Shut the fuck up and don't talk. [ Grunts ] Floyd! - What the hell? - What you laughing at, bitch? - Fuck you, Adolf. - You're dead, wetback. Enough! It's not him you should be worrying about. Right? It's all right. I got the word out. It better be all right, homes. So, what you gonna do when you graduate law school? Practice law. I know that, wiseass. [ Gear Shifts ] - What kind of law? - The kind that buys me a big townhouse... on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. - So it's all about money? - I plan on doing some pro bono work. But first I got to be successful. Hmm. You got some pretty big expectations. I put myselfthrough school, and I'm gonna put myself through law school. And when I'm all done, I wanna retire to, like, Miami. South Beach. Live a nice, comfortable life, you know. [ Chuckling ] Retire? Man, you'll be too old to enjoy it. Money isn't everything, my friend. [ Exhales ] I gotta go. Just can't wait. Move. Oh, God. - Walter, where's the fire? - Man, I got to go. [ Crawford ] Hey, hey, me too, man. Can you hurry it up?

Fourteen years old and still acts like a knucklehead. - How's your dad? - Uh, Dad passed away a few years back. [ Toilet Flushes ] Mom's fine though. - [ Sheriff] I'm sorry to hear that. - Next. He was a good man. He was a great help when we had that trouble... - at the old mill years ago. - Mm-hmm. [ Sheriff] I think it got to him. [ Chuckling ] I can't believe howyou've grown.

I thought it was just some hillbilly. - It eats people. - [ Laughing ] No. You got to be out ofyour mind. It's a fucking mutant! Deformed! It's got, like, three fingers on one hand. And it kills to feed. I've seen it. So then, why doesn't it eat the animals in the woods? Because there are none. It's a cannibal. We're its food. [ Nate ] We're gonna get you out ofhere.

But it doesn't look familiar. [ Nate ] Careful. [ Walter Groans ] You. How old would you say that thing is? [ Nate ] Late '50s maybe. Let's go.

He's right. - Let's go. - [ Shotgun Cocks ] Shut the fuck up, bitch, and don't even think about giving me an attitude. 'Cause I'll shoot you where you stand, you hear? You. I said climb in the fucking cab and take a look around. - Any dead bodies? - No. They're gone. They must have been ejected. You guys have a look around for bones. One ofthe guards must have had some keys. I don't think you'll find anything. [ Chavez ] Why? Because somebody broke the windshield from the outside to get inside. All the glass is in here. And judging from the amount ofdried blood, they died in the cab. - You find anything else? - No. Then get out ofthere. Found these. This mightjust be our lucky day. Well, I'll be damned. [ Floyd ] Sweet Mother ofJesus! We're fucking rich! Holy shit! How much money do you think's in there? [ Brandon ] Who cares? - It'll just slow us down. - Fine. We'll split your share.

Go on. [ Groaning ] - Him too. - He can't. He's too badly injured. - I'll carry his bags. - Or I will. Everybody's got to carry their own weight. Now, pick 'em up. [ Nate ] Please. -Just let me carry the bags for Walter. - Shut up! I'm waiting. You smiling bastard. Pick 'em up. Pick 'em up! [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] [ Groaning ] [ Coughing, Laughing ] You know what they say about money, don't you, Chavez? I don't know, Corrections Officer. What do they say about money? They say money's hard to spend— [ Panting ] when you're dead. [ Shouts ] [ Gun Clicks ] [ Grunting ] [ Spitting ] Now, that was a stupid thing to do, now, wasn't it? Huh? Nowjust pick up the bags. Shove it up your ass. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. You hear me? Shove it up your ass, motherfucker. [ Alex Screams, Sobs ] Oh, my God! No! Walter! Walter! Don't. Don't do it. [ Quietly ] Not now. You stubborn fuck. [ Creaking ] [ Crawford ] What the fuck? [ Alex Screams ] [ Growls ] [ Yells ] Come here. [ Shrieks ] This is what's been fucking with us? A mutant kid? That's not him. This thing was a full-grown man. He was deformed like him. Oh, would you look at that. It's got three fucking toes. Probably his kid, huh? Okay. Now, let's send this cocksucking hillbilly a message. You. Hold it. [ Whimpering ] Floyd. Yeah. Hold him down. Come here. Hold him down. - [ Knife Stabs ] - [ Screaming ] Here's the rafts. [ Crawford ] What? That's a two-man raft. That's not gonna hold all of us and the money. - Huh? So what do we do know? - It'sjust for the bags. You can go fuck yourself ifyou thinkyou're taking it all. - Let's worry about that once we get these chains off. - [ Rock Striking Leg Irons ] Man, that ain't gonna work. [ Shotgun Cocks ] This might sting a little at first. God... damn it! Fuck! - [ Laughing ] - What the fuck did you do that for? Well, you said the rocks weren't gonna work. - So I thought that'll do the trick. - Are you fucking crazy? I don't know. Maybe I am. How are we gonna deal with the boat? Let'sjust get it in the river first, and then we'll figure it all out, all right? - Uh, I don't think that's a good idea, man. - Shut up, Crawford. [ Hissing ] - Now we're walking. - You stupid son ofa bitch! - Oh, God! - [ Groaning ] Fuckin' asshole! Why did you fuckin' do that? Huh? Why did you fuckin' do that? Tell me! Fuckin' tell me! Stop it! Stop it! You got something to say? Huh? You got something to fucking say? [ Coughing, Spits ] Looks like you still need this mule to carry your money. That's right. Then I guess it's back to you, Corrections Officer Wilson. Now, you wanna live, you get me the fuck out of here. Now, lead on! Lead on! Get up! Get up! Give me that. Now, move! Move! Get a fucking move on. [ Grunting ] [ Whimpering ] [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing Loudly ] [ Chuckling ] Sounds like he's learned his lesson. [ Chuckling ] Either that, or we just pissed him off. [ Sobbing, Screaming Loudly ] [ Newscaster On TV ] Good evening. [ Phone Ringing ] [ Newscaster Continues ] Hello. [ Ally ] Hi, Sheriff. I just got a call from a Cliff Moore. He said he spotted a truck up by the upper river inlet yesterday. - Any sign ofthe kids? - No. If it's all the same to you, I thought I'd drive out there and take a look. Any word from Nate Wilson or the corrections office? No. Not a peep. Why? Were you expecting a call? No. I just got a bad feeling, that's all. I'll be there in a minute. [ Distant Hooting ] What is that? It can't be, but it looks like Preslow's keys. Good. Now we can get these fuckin' chains off. Now! [ Grunting ] [ Gasps ] - [ All Groaning ] - [ Mutant Cackling ] Come on, you motherfuckin' hillbilly! Come get me! You got a death wish? Don't fuck with me again. Right? [ Panting ] Fuck. What the hell is going on? I'll tell you what's going on. - He's gonna kill us all. That's what's going on. - He's hunting us. Well, he won't be the only one hunting us in a couple ofhours. - So let's go. - How are we supposed to do that? [ Fabric Rips ] Here. Cut it at the kneejoint. You don't have to cut through any bone. Jesus fucking Christ. Fucking pussy. Give me that. [ Vomiting ] [ Vomiting Continues ] Fucking wetback. [ Laughing ] [ Crawford Coughing ] - At the kneejoint. That's it. - [ Laughing ] Piece ofshit. Okay. Let's get out of here. Come on. Get your bags. Let's get out of here. Take that. Come on! Move! Why don't you call Hazelton? And say what exactly? That I got a bad feeling? That Nate didn't answer his cell? Itjust seems like an awful lot ofeffort for a hunch. Well, it's my hunch, so it's my effort. You really think they staged a breakout? I don't know what to think, Ally. What about that truck up by the river? You follow it up. [ Bag Zips ] [ Floyd ] What is this place? [ Chavez ] This doesn't look like the watchtower. It's not. I've never seen this place before. There has to be some tools that we can use on these chains. [ Chavez ] And you better make it quick. Move. [ Clanking ] Jackpot! Give me that. Wait your turn, asshole. [ Grunts ] [ Metal Clanks ] [ Metal Clanking ] - How much farther? - [ Panting ] I'm not sure. - A couple of hours maybe. - You better find it. Oh-ho-ho, man. I got to go pinch a loaf. I say we split up. No. - Maybe it's a good idea. - You think this is a democracy? - You wanna fuckin' debate me? - What happens when we meet up with your men? What are you gonna do then, Chavez? What ever happened to honor among thieves? You're gonna kill us all, then you're gonna take the cash foryourself. That's what you're gonna do. Yeah, you're right. I probably will kill all ofyou. Then why shouldn't we kill you now, eh? Good luck. And you better be quick, oryou're surely gonna be dead. Then I'll kill all you motherfuckers. But I don't think that's in your best interest, - compared to a compromise. - [ Chuckling ] Hey. Hey. I just wiped my ass with a $1 00 bill. It's comin' out ofyour share, asshole. Now, shut the fuck up. What do you propose? You got one gun. I got two. These humps have none. Now, I can't carry all the bags ofcash on my own. And ifyou kill me, that's one less pair of hands. Plus I have something none ofyou do. - Yeah? What's that? - Infrastructure. What? My men will find me. And all ofyou can come with us to a safe house and not be on the run. And in exchange for that, you give me one ofthe bags you're all carrying, and you all get to keep the other one. How can you trust him, Floyd? We can't. Deal. Now get this bum up. Sorry about your friends. This isn't going to end well. I know that. Then why are you going along with them? Up to now, being all chained together, I really didn't have much ofa choice, did I? So that's the fourth time we've passed that tree in the last two hours. What are you up to, Nate? Bidin' my time. Chavez catches on, man, he'll kill you. He's right, Nate. Even I noticed. You gotta be careful. [ Nate ] You should go back to the road. Turn yourself in when the police arrive. I am not going back through the woods alone, unarmed, to get sliced up by that hillbilly freak. I don't know who's worse— him or Chavez. Listen. I'll do what I can to help you once we've reached the ranger station. I appreciate that, but I thinkyou should look afteryourselffirst. Chavez isn't gonna bring anyone along for the ride that he can't use. You're damn right. He'll kill us all for the money. Ifthat cannibal freak doesn't beat him to it. [ Exhales ] It's ironic. What is? Money. I struggled my whole life to put myselfthrough school... so I could get out of here and make good money. So? Now I'm holding in my hands more money than most people ever make in a lifetime, and all I wanna do is get rid of it. [ Panting ] This is a logging access road. Fire watchtower's on the other side... further along the mountain. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Crawford. [ Faint Howling ] Come here. Thinkyou can jack that thing? Piece ofcake, man. Finally, a ride out ofthis shit-hole. Wait a minute. That's the tow truck that ran us offthe road. That's why Crawford here is gonna go get it for us. [ Grunts ] Right, Crawford? [ Grunts ] I don't know about that, man. I mean— It's a truck.Just run over there and check it out. Come on! We got the cash. Now let's get the hell out of here! No way, man! Send soldier boy, damn it! I'm not the car thief. You are. [ Scoffs ] Could be a trap, man. Get movin', asshole. Go on. Damn it. [ Sighs ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Lift Whirring ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Engine Starts ] Help me! Please! [ Screaming ] Fuckin' hillbilly motherfucker! I'm gonna find you, then I'm gonna fuckin' kill you! [ Screaming Continues ] No! [ Screams ] Let's backtrack and get as far away from here as possible. He's not gonna stop until we're all dead. Who the fuck is he? Tell me right now! [ Gasps ] I don't know! The fuckyou don't! You grew up here! The sheriffsaid so! [ Grunts ] Now you better get us the fuck out of here before that freak comes back. Fuck him. We don't need him anymore. You kill me, and you're on your own— lost. - Maybe I don't give a shit. - He doesn't know anything! Can't you see that? Whoa! Just wait a minute. Ifyou kill him now, we are fucked. Okay? We have no idea where we're going, with some crazy hick out there trying to pick us all offone by one. No. [ Chavez ] Enough. Come on. Now, you don't want to see me angry. Now, you get me to that station— and a phone, you hear? [ Screaming ] No! [ Screaming ] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! God! I need a rest. Get the fuck up. We gotta keep moving. Get up, both ofyou. - It's the money that's slowing us down. We gotta lose it. - No way. They'll be looking for us in a couple of hours. Ifwe don't show up at Hazelton, the F.B.I., U.S. Marshals... and every law officer in West Virginia is gonna be hunting you. Brandon's right. Ifyou want to get away, you need to move quicker. - Dump the money. - Now you listen to me. We move now with the cash, or we all wait here and die. [ Bag Drops On Ground ] [ Floyd ] She's the one who's slowin' us down. [ Gasps ] Ah. - [ Chavez ] Be cool. - [ Sniffs ] Be cool. She's a nice piece ofass though. Let'sjust pass her around, then pop her in the head... and get the fuck out of- [ Grunting ] [ Groans ] I'm gonna kill you, you fuckin' bitch! [ Shotgun Cocks ] [ Panting ] Notjust yet. Now be cool. Stay calm. I got this in hand. Be cool. All right? Now, you just chill the fuck out. - You're dead, bitch. - We're all dead, asshole! Give me my gun back. [ Panting ] Looks like you got some impulse-control issues there, Floyd. I don't think so. You having all three guns does us no good ifthat freak comes after us again. Then that'sjust a chance I'm gonna have to take. They're gonna start lookin' for us soon. There'll be a full search by morning. - Ifwe make it till then. - We'll make it. These guys don't look like they'rejust gonna let you go. Why haven't they killed you already? They need me. And what happens when they don't need you anymore? I'm not planning on finding out. There should be a radio and cell phone at the watchtower. I'll call for help once we get there. - How do you plan on keeping this lot under control? - There's a ladder. Only one person can climb up at a time. It's 75 feet straight up and through a trapdoor. Each station has a gun hidden in it, and I know where they keep it. It's a tight space. I can ambush Chavez when we're up there. I just want to go home. It'll be okay, Alex. I'll get you out ofthis. [ Faint Shrieking ] [ Chavez ] Walkin' a little slow there, aren't you, Floyd? She hurt you that bad? - Die, bitch! - Wha— [ Both Grunting ] Come on. [ Grunting Continues ] [ Yells ] SheriffCarver calling Deputy Lane. Come in. Over. Ally, this is Calvin. Come in. Over. [ Radio Static ] County Dispatch, this is SheriffCarver. I want to report an emergency. Over. [ Man On Radio ] Go, Sheriff. The custody bus from Grafton Penitentiary has crashed... offthe old mill road near mile marker 37. I'm goin' in to take a look around. Carver out. Dispatch, this is Carver. [ Man On Radio ] Come in, Sheriff. [ Sheriff] There is no one onboard. Gonna see if I can track them. Carver out. Roger that. [ Grunts ] Come on. Let's go. [ Both Grunting ] [ Fist Smacks ] All right. Stop. He's had enough. - I say when the Nazi bastard's had enough! - [ Floyd Groaning ] [ Grunts ] [ Groans ] [ Spits ] Now, which way did they go? I don't know. I didn't see 'em go. Come on. Well, what do we do with him? Fuck him. Leave him. Nate, I— I can't run anymore. I— I just need a minute. We need to keep moving. Wejust have to make it a few more hours, and then we'll be fine. The police are coming. You can do this. Listen, Chavez. You can't get out of here alone. You know that, right? I'll be fine. - Well, I can get you out ofthese woods. - So, what do you want? A fair deal. - How much? - [ Scoffs ] No. I don't want the money. I don't need it. But you gotta promise me that you'll let me go when your boys show up. Fine. And, uh, I also need one ofthose guns. Why should I give you a gun? Because whatever's hunting us is gonna continue hunting us till we're both dead. It's simple tactical strategy. Two gunners are better than one. - And why should I trust you? - [ Scoffs ] Why would I fuckyou? I helped you with Floyd, didn't I? Well, I didn't run. [ Groaning ] [ Spits, Panting ] [ Grunting ] [ Chittering ] [ Door Creaks ] [ Lock Clicks ] [ Muttering ] [ Chittering Continues ] [ Muttering Continues ] Ah. [ Muttering ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Groans ] [ Barking ] [ Distant Whistle ] [ Distant Chittering ] [ Inhales, Exhales ] Where will you take them, Nate? [ Breathing Heavily ] I'm too old for this shit. Come on. We gotta go. We're not far now. Psst! [ Nate ] We gotta move. We gotta keep moving. [ Alex ] I can't go on anymore. [ Nate ] Come on. [ Whispers ] Over there. Okay. Let's leave the bags down over here. Come on. We'll come back for them later. - [ Screams ] - [ Grunting ] [ Blow Lands ] [ Screams ] You shouldn't have run. Stop it! Stop it! [ Grunts, Sobs ] Shut the fuck up, puta! This is all your fault! - Maybe I should end you first! - Wait. That's not gonna get us anywhere. It gets the bitch out ofthe way though! The watchtower'sjust right over the hill. [ Grunts ] You've been leading us in circles all night. Why should I believe you now? It'sjust over the hill— right there. I swear. It'll take two minutes to find out. Please. Get this bitch out! [ Grunting ] Move. [ Whimpers ] [ Chavez ] This is it? A bunch offuckin' charcoal? - It must've been burned down. - No shit. So now what? I don't know. This is the only place I knew ofthat had a radio. You've been fuckin' with me the whole time, haven't you? - No. - Fuck you. You're a liar! He's not lying. Nate thought the tower was gonna be here. We were gonna barricade ourselves in and call for help. Well, let'sjust keep moving, all right? It's gotta be at least 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. by now. - We could go northeast. - I've had enough ofyour bullshit. Get on your fuckin' knees! - Get on your fuckin' knees! - There's a small town 1 0 miles past the river. - I'll take you there. - Fuckyou. Say good-bye, asshole. - Think about this, Chavez. - He's out there. What? I can feel him. He's been following us. He's close. Shh. [ Chuckles ] [ Gun Cocks ] I warned you. - [ Growling ] - [ Chavez Screaming ] Get it off me! Get this fucking dog off me! Drop the gun! Down, boy! Get the dog off me! Take his guns, Nate. Are you okay? I'm fine, Sheriff. Just really glad to see you. When you didn't answer your cell, I— I came looking. There are others out there. How many? Don't know. At least one other prisoner and some freak hillbilly local. Hillbilly? That can't be. Please. Let'sjust get out of here. Okay. Come on. Let's move it up there. Hey, you, come on. Move your ass. Get up. Come on! Move it! Move it, you son ofa bitch! Move! Come on, honey. He's close. He's really close. Who is? He's a fucking monster. Please. Please. I just want to get home. Oh, all right.Just— Just calm down, little lady. [ Cackling ] - [ Screams ] - [ Screams ] [ Whimpering ] - [ Cackling ] - [ Gunshots ] Ifyou thinkyou're moving out ofthis forest... without going back for the cash, you're fuckin' wrong. Now move. Move. [ Sobbing ] [ Laughs ] Jackpot. Chavez, you stupid son ofa bitch. [ Grunting, Panting ] - [ Police Radio Chatter ] - This is where the sheriff reported the bus crash. On foot in this terrain, they should be within this perimeter. I want it approached from all sides, and we'll work our way in. When is the air support getting here? They're in the air. They should be here within the hour. Gentleman, we have a man out there. I want all precautions taken. Let's move. Yes, sir. Where's my bags? Are you sure this was the spot? Yes, this was the spot. Now where's my goddamn fuckin' money? Huh? It's Floyd. I'm gonna kill that motherfucker. No. I'm gonna skin him alive first, then I'm gonna fucking kill him! Shit!

Come on! Move! Let's go! [ Horn Honking ] [ Honking Continues ] [ Engine Rumbling ] It's gotta be a trap. Yeah, but why would he think it'd work? What the fuck does he want? You hear that?
