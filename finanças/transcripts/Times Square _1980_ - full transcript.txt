Huh, you like the sound of that? How's this sound? He was a young man at Yale law school when I was there. He's still a young man, but an old friend of new York's with a long list of crusades, including the west side daycare cooperatives, the best pocket park programs, and as most of you know the museum on wheels. We're here to sign up on his new mission to renew New York's finest and most famous landmark, to turn the lights back on along the great white way. So here's the man behind the Times Square renaissance, David Pearl. Thank you. Thank you, Charles. The question we want to ask ourselves today, especially those of us with children, is this. Do we want to live in an X-rated city? Last week, my daughter Pamela asked to go see One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. She's 13, she's here with me this afternoon. Isn't she pretty? Now, I've seen the movie. It's a good picture. I don't care if she has to lie about her age to get in. After all, I'm a liberal. But when she told me where the damn thing was playing, 42nd street and seventh avenue, I had to put my foot down. Well, I don't mind telling you, we had a little fight. And she of course began to argue with me, "But oh daddy, daddy, the film is only rated R." It's not true. "Well, that may be so." I said. - It's not true. - But that street outside is rated X. It's not true, you're lying! Well, I guess she's still mad at me. I guess my daughter doesn't like the west side, knowing that her father still exerts some control over it. What about my axe, man? You can't just leave my stuff here. All right honey, come on. Just get in the car. That's my private property! You can't leave my stuff on the street like that! Don't worry about it. Your friends will take care of it. Now get in there. - Who'll take care of it? Fucking nobody, that stuff comes with me. Would you get in the car? What is this? That's bullshit. It's bullshit. Bullshit that's bullshit. I got a fucking condition, man. I could go any second. I'll fucking sue you! - Condition, Ma, come on. - Let's go. - I'll fucking sue the whole city! - Hey I know my rights. - You got it? I'm a human being, that's my fucking music, man! - That one, got it? Shut your condition and go, will you? Goddamit! Look out. There are 8 million stories in the big city. People say I have a bird's eye view perched up here night after night, looking down into the throbbing, pulsing main line veins of the city, looking right down into the heart of the beast. Yes, it's Storytime. This is Johnny LaGuardia. It's that kind of night and that kind of feeling. Okay, we have a story. It's a story of a young girl who writes a letter to a man on the radio. "Dear Mr. LaGuardia, do you think it's okay if I pretend I'm a zombie? My mother died a long time ago, but my father is rich and famous and perfect. But I can't be like him. He expects me to be happy, but I'm clumsy and ugly. I don't want anyone looking at me. I can't do anything. I can't do sports. I can't dance. I can't make friends. I wrote you before, but only in my journal." The letter is signed, "A real zombie." You have something very special inside you, young lady, the seed that contains your unique self. You must learn to nurture that seed. Maybe you're all alone. That's a pretty scary place to be. I know about it. You may have to jump off into the darkness. How desperate they feel, those moments before you jump. But sometimes you just gotta do it. You ought to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and you gotta jump. Yes it's Storytime on WJAD in the heart of Times Square, New York, New York. The city so nice, they named it twice. ♪ It's time she stopped being your ornament ♪ ♪ It's time she put it in the past for permanent ♪ ♪ You can't hold her if she wants to roam around ♪ ♪ Around around around around ♪ ♪ You can't hold her dreamin' keep her gagged and bound ♪ ♪ Gagged and bound ♪ ♪ Shout it clear for all to hear ♪ ♪ You won't shoot this ♪ ♪ bird down ♪ - Quit! ♪ Shout it clear for all to hear ♪ And Jack was also very reassuring. He said for every genuine case of seizure, he sees a dozen he just chalks up to some mysterious teenage stress syndrome. But of course we want to be absolutely sure. Well maybe there's nothing wrong with me at all, Daddy. That's perfectly likely. Now sweetheart I have a one o'clock at the Ford foundation. I'll see you later. You're my best girl. You make me proud of you. Hold it. This would be your room, Pamela. And you have a roommate, Nicky Marotta. Miss Marotta? I want to introduce Pamela to you, your new roommate. It's a young lady who's in for the same test that you are. Nicky, I have someone for you to meet. Nicky, can you hear me? Nicky? Nicky, you know there's no smoking in here. Just put the cigarette away, please, will you? Nicky Marotta, I'd like you to meet Pamela Pearl. Sure you're going to be great friends. ♪ I wanna be sedated ♪ ♪ Nothing to do, nowhere to go ♪ ♪ I wanna be sedated ♪ ♪ Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane ♪ ♪ Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go insane ♪ ♪ I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain ♪ ♪ Oh no, oh-oh oh-oh ♪ Nicky, don't you think your friend Pamela is sick of that song? - How are we feeling today, sweetheart? You remember our own friend Dr. Jack Zymansky. Pamela, this is Dr. Huber of Columbia Presbyterian, Professor of Neuropsychiatry. He's attending this month and we're very privileged to have him here with us. Walter, would you say hello to commissioner David Pearl? Nice to meet you doctor. It's a pleasure. Well, she's got a clean bill of health on the brainwave tests. We're going to run a cat scan on her this afternoon and that should complete the picture. It's a sophisticated kind of x-ray. It doesn't even touch her head, completely, non-invasive. It's just like going under a hairdryer. It's a big comfy lean back chair. Oh, it's just like the beauty parlor. Am I going crazy? You know, Pamela, every boy and girl at a certain point in their growing up, suddenly their body begins to manufacture hormones, lots of them. Up to 30 times the amount that it did before. It's a big shock to the system. Believe it or not. Oh, no. Who is that patient anyway? Shouldn't she be sedated? Oh, certainly not if we are in time for facing. That's all right, relax. Why is she in a room with my daughter? She was put here by me. They're both going under the same tests. But Jack, wouldn't my daughter be more comfortable in a private room? Please don't put me in a private room. Simon? Heavy, have you seen Simon? You seen Simon? - Uh-uh. Simon? Hey, come on, come on. What's happening? He says the Storytime quote of the day is too Jewish. - Too Jewish? - Yes. I'm working on the zombie girl from this morning. He thinks her dad might be somebody. Okay, screw the zombie girl, we got to get this. LaGuardia has 90 seconds here, all right? Hands that help are more holy in the eyes of God than lips that pray, all right? Okay, gotta take God out of there. Hands that help are groovier than lips that... Lips that... Lips that whisper. Strike lips, contradicts hands. ♪ The eyes of God ♪ - Lipstick, whisper. - Eyes. - Lipstick whisper. - Eyes, eyes whispering. - Lips. - Lips. A helping hand is groovier than the lips of man. He'll never use groovier. Prayer, prayers? How about prayers? Praying lips of words, a helping hand? - We need more time to write this crap. Hands. Hands. - The eyes of God, it's a goddamn can of worms. I got it. - Hands of love. - I've got it. - Hands... - Oh god help me. That help are a beautiful, silent prayer. That is beautiful. That is sickening, he'll love it. And now it's time for the Storytime quote of the day. And it's a good one, friends. I'd like to share it with you. A helping word is like a prayer. A helping hand is an answer to that prayer. Maestro. The man is a genius, what can I tell you? Good morning, Pamela. How's our star patient? We're going to have you out of here in no time. I will examine you once more, Ms. Marotta. Nicole Marotta. Can you hear this? Do you ever hear voices? Do you ever hear ringing or a banging sound before you get angry? Have you banged your head lately? Series one, negative. Say the word Massachusetts. Massachusetts. Say Methodist Episcopal. Methodist Episcopal. Methodist Episcopal. Take a piss, you ass hole. Series two, negative. Nicole, I'm going to repeat to you a familiar saying. I'm sure you've heard it more than once. And I want you to explain it to me in your own words. Okay? A rolling stone gathers no moss. Well, a rolling stone doesn't need to gather moss. He's a fucking millionaire. What's he gonna roll downhill for? Well how about this one? People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Well, people who live in glass houses, shouldn't... Wait a minute. You know. They have to be careful. People disappear every day. Well, you should know the meaning of that, Dr. Zymansky. Yes I do, Pamela. And how about this? Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Out of the frying pan and into the fire is where you go when you don't want to be eaten for dinner. Well. Ladies, I guess that's enough for today. Ms. Marotta? Can you hear me? Nicky! I keep the creeps away like that. I got my own room at the Hopkins where I was detained. Though I can see why I always end up in places like this. It's my old man, you know? He's fucked up. I mean, he's a good guy and all, but, he's wasted himself. His brains are fried, you know what I mean? Got a match? That figures. Why'd your father throw you in here? Now let me tell you something. They can't wait to turn you into a vegetable in this place. That's why I gotta avoid, 'cause I ain't got much time. I expect to live past 21. That's why I gotta jam it all in now, you know? Figures, no fucking matches in this place. Hey, you taking your pills? Now listen, don't. Take the pills, you lose all your fight. Fight's all you got, right? Am I right? Your father's a creep. And you're too uptight to say shit. It's 5:29 on a Tuesday morning and Time Square's answer to Diogenes is swinging his beacon far out into the night, looking for an honest man on Broadway. ♪ Looking for love on Broadway ♪ Thank you. Johnny LaGuardia's the name. WJAD is the station. It's 94.7 on your FM dial. I'll talk to you tomorrow. God willing. A poem for Nicky Marotta. Tiny fossil bones, translucent skin, billion year old eyes. Dinosaur, you don't belong here. They'll kill you for your tiny tusks, put your ribs on my ladder, Nicky. I'm so amazed. I'm so amazed. I saw in Women's Wear Daily. David Pearl, 34, recently appointed the head the mayoral commissioner for Times Square attired in a midnight blue tuxedo. He rushed home from the opening of the Met to catch Merv Griffin. Seems Suzanne Somers was guesting and young pro is an inveterate jiggle vision addict. Time to shut off the TV set, David. Come see Times Square in the flesh, not from the windows of your limo. It's hot down here. It's Haiti. It's Rio at carnival time. It's ripe, baby. Get in touch with that place inside you that craves slime more than plastic, David, and vitality more than manners, David, and life more than television. Good morning, Ms. Pearl. Wake up hun. Sit up. Here, these are for you. We're going to move you to a private room this morning. Ms. Marotta's been discharged. Oh, hi. - Hi, how you doing? - Good morning Ms. Washington. Sorry about the hurry but we thought because of the circumstances. Nicky, you want to just have a seat there please? So you couldn't find anything in there? No, itsy bitsy tumor we can blame or something? As far as the staff is concerned, she deliberately creates disturbances in order to manipulate her environment. So the next step is Rockland State then. Oh. Hey Nicky?

The zombie girl is the daughter of the boy wonder at the mayor's office, and she's missing. Who else is onto this? No one. We are going to do everything ourselves because we know better than them what we want. We'll show that we are human beings and not dogs. Nicky, I'm not afraid. Afraid of drowning? No. Good. I know just the place for us. Come on, huh? There's tons of these dead trunks in here. Just look at all this junk. Probably should sell these for profit. We can blast these open too. Lot of sleaze in here. The sleaze sisters. Look Pam, the sink works. Pammy, look! It's a fucking bathtub! Hey, a back porch. Come on, Pam. Now I see. Why didn't I realize it before? God, let me see! Don't you realize? This is it! This is the place! I'll show you, watch this. Bad blood, now give me yours. Come on, don't worry. I ain't going to hurt you, just relax. See? That's all. Now, I want you to listen to me. You ever feel like freaking, when you get panicky, shaky, I want you to call my name. Just scream it! Scream it as loud as you can. You know, like this. Pammy! Pammy! Nicky! Louder. Nicky! Pammy! Nicky! Pammy! - Nicky! - Pammy! - Nicky! - Pammy! - Nicky! - Pammy! - Hello Mrs. Washington. - Hi, how are you? - Come this way. - Thank you. Please, let's just stick to demonstrable facts. The young woman is dangerous. She has a record. She carries a weapon. She's an incorrigible delinquent. She's angry. With all due respect. Ms. Washington, I think we can say she's more than just angry. You would be more than just angry too, Mr. Pearl if you've been abandoned as many times as Nicky has. Look, I am sure that her childhood was an absolute disaster, but that's not the point. This young woman has been arrested four times in the last 12 month period. We don't know that she kidnapped your daughter. Witnesses say that your daughter went along with her on her own. Look, Lieutenant. I don't give a about your witnesses, I know my daughter. - David. - She would not run away. David, try to relax. Look, Jack, you were relaxed, plenty relaxed when she left that hospital. Now I'll relax when I find her, when we find her. About these pictures, I'd like to hand them out to the press. It will help in our investigation. We will do whatever we have to do, whatever is necessary. Pamela's safety comes first. Please, one step at a time. Okay. Apparently some dear Abby type just came on the radio and announced that the daughter of the mayor's commissioner to clean up Times Square is a runaway in the city. - Jesus Christ. How the hell did they get that? Look, let's just try to remember that we are walking through a minefield. And I'm not speaking for myself. Believe me, I will resign tomorrow if that's what's called for. But today I am still a public servant in the public eye, soliciting millions of dollars. And this makes Pamela's situation extremely vulnerable. Well it's out now. Maybe we can use it. The evening lies spread out against the sky, like a patient etherized upon a table. I have measured out my life in coffee spoons. Still sounds like bullshit to me. Nicky, what about songs? What about the roses in the hospital? What about take a piss you asshole? That's poetry. But it don't rhyme. It doesn't have to. It doesn't have to fit in a book. Nicky, everything you do or you say is poetry. At least I think so. Nah. Yada yada yada yada yada. Give us a break, Jesus H. Christ, the guy is on the air! Out, out! Out. What? It's in my contract. I can break in at any time with a timely and important announcement. Not on the seven o'clock news. This is news. This is lies, filler and chatter. This is going to get you fired. Out. The mayor was meeting with local sanitation. Police and municipal leaders... Make me live. We interrupt this newscast with a flash bulletin. This is Johnny LaGuardia from WJAD bringing you the latest on the Pearl kidnapping. Now I don't know who kidnapped who, but runaways, can you hear me? Tune in to me because I'm tuned into you. And I'm tuned into the big lie about the medical attention you two need so desperately. A Storytime reporter has seen your records from New York Neurological. And what they boil down to is this. There's nothing medically wrong with either one of you. Well, figure it out for yourselves because either those doctors don't know what they're doing or they're lying through their teeth.

Now remember 10'll get you 20, 20'll get you 40. And 50'll get you a hundred dollar bill. Keep that red card in your mind. 'Cause red, you're Fred and black you lose, you lose your shoes. Come on, who's betting, who's betting? I'm getting sick of shuffling these cards. Maybe I'm bored, go deal for that card. Come on, I wanna see some money. Who's betting, who's betting? Oh, here's a little lady with some money. You look lucky, you look like a winner. - Thank you. - Just slap a 20 on me. I got a feeling about you, pretty white girl. All right, now I cover that, now which one is it? Yeah take a pick, which one is it? That's your choice then. Shit, slick, you lose! You lose the 20! You're supposed to win, what's wrong with you?

When was this thing on? Four a.m. Luckily who's listening? We got a call her saying she's staring out her window at Nicki Marotta right now on the corner of 43rd and eighth. That's close. I'm going over there. What about the police? No. Down at the corner. All right, later. Take it easy. Don't struggle. I'm going to let you go in a minute. Come on. All I want to do is talk with my daughter, all right? I ain't telling you a thing, mister.. Look, she needs medical attention and other things you don't know anything about. Yeah well if you're so smart, how come you didn't stop her shakes? - I did! - All right, look, you've done very well and you ought to be proud. But the time has come for this to stop. Are you trying to con me, shitface? Where is she, where is she?! Why don't you hit me again huh? Hit me with your fist! You're a big man. Come on! Hit me again. I don't like coming down so heavy on this mental illness jargon. It's a scare tactic. The girl is dangerous. That's what we've got to get across to Pamela. An open letter to Pamela Pearl. Pamela, I care about Nicky too. Nicky is ill. She has what is called a thinking disorder. Often she cannot tell truth from fiction. That means she reacts impulsively and violently. Her tolerance for frustration is low. She's dangerous to herself and others. Auto theft is not all Nicky is wanted for. She will probably face manslaughter charges in the drowning death of her friend Sharon. Enough is enough. Get her to turn herself in before she turns 17 and loses the benefits of the juvenile system. Sincerely, Rosie Washington. Words are fucked. Well, a lot of people died around me. Ain't nothing new. My mother died on me when I was nine years old. People dig dying on me. Sharon. She fucking OD's on me. Try to fresh her up in a river. Fuck, I don't know. People disappear every day. Maybe I should disappear too, huh? You should stand and fight. Hello out there, truth lovers.

It's hurting me. I never told you everything. I never said the stuff I should. I was chicken to tell you! I never thought I could. Find me! Help me! Save me! Can you hear me? Can you feel me out there? Pammy! I'm calling you, Pammy! Pammy! Pammy! Pammy! She's right here, she's resting. The medication was very light. Nonetheless, she is very, very quiet, now. Jojo, it's me. What happened to you? I'm okay. Just a little tired. I think I'm a little tired. Nicky, look at me. What did they do to you? Nothing. I'm under control now. I'd walk into the ocean if they told me to. Hey, you're a damn dog. No sense makes sense, right? It's me, slick. Come on, we're the Sleeze Sisters. You did this to her. - Pamela, you- - Get off of me! You only care about yourself, you faker. If feels like I give myself away every day for a living. You give other people away for a living. I hate you. Come on. This is my father's office. Hello, WKVL. Yeah, well I'm not repeating this so get this straight. This is Nicky Marotta, the famous murderer and entertainer. I'm throwing a concert tonight in Times Square to celebrate my escape from mental illness. Don't miss it, asshole. Tonight, that's right, I said tonight. My little cousin, Nicky Marotta will be in Times Square and she wants all the Sleeze cousins. The young woman sought in the Pamela Pearl kidnapping case is rumored to be putting on a free concert tonight on 42nd street. When asked, police commissioner reports- There's going to be one big party tonight in Times Square. Tonight's the night if you're a Sleeze Sister. Check it out, midnight in times square. Here's what Nicky Marotta says. If they treat you like garbage, put your body in a garbage bag. If they treat you like a criminal, black out your eyes. What makes you think it's going to happen? Aggie's retired. She'll be cool. She ain't no fool. She knows slick's going back to school. That's right. I want to do normal stuff. I just want to be myself, Nicky. So what's stopping you? I'll just sit here and wait for the cops. I can't be like you. You're different. You're a star. Well I'll tell you one thing, slick. We sure had them going for awhile. I don't think it was such a bad life. I wouldn't put it down. Then will you do the concert? Will you do it for all the dinosaurs that disappeared? I want to, Pammy. Except I'll probably blow it. I'm beat. Valerie, what? Are you planning to go out like that? Everybody's wearing this tonight, mother. George, do you consider that a way to go out on the street? Come on. George. Where's the TV, Magda? Where the hell is the TV? Just a minute. Okay. You ready? It's coming together. A dollar each. Yo, get a ice cold beer, a dollar each. Dollar each, that's one dollar each. Just a dollar each. Sleeze bag there, one dollar. One dollar for the Sleeze bags. All right, give us Sleeze bag. All right, yo sir, we got Sleez Bags for a dollar. One dollar for a Sleez bag, you gonna buy a bag? All right, sir, thank you very much. What's being celebrated here is the comeback of a 16 year old entertainer called Aggie Doole.
