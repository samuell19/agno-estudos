Hi Niña! Get up Oca! It's getting late! Get your ass working! All day, you do nothing but sleep! Get up! I'm really unlucky with you! Your children even got your laziness. Oca, get up! Your son got caught in a rumble last night. So that's why he didn't go home. You should have given him a curfew. Curfew? I've already given him all kinds of curfew before. Problem is, your brother doesn't mind the time! And you Lyn, why haven't you cooked yet? There's nothing to cook. Hmmm, excuses! Mom! I'm still doing my manicure! What's keeping you busy son? Is that for her again? Oh, this is new mom. I'll let you taste this when you get here. What's that? - Are you done? - Not yet, mom. That girl seems so special. Very. I'm sure she'll love you. She'll love this, mom. It's very exclusive. There's this one I went to in Singapore. Uh-huh. I already did. And he's really very interested. Please be mine, please be mine. I will take care of your heart. Please be mine. I'm really going to teach A-Cap a lesson! This tastes good Aira. Hmmm... What's up guys? Let's get to work! Honey, do you have 500 pesos? We have to buy our groceries. I do have money for the groceries, but not for A-Cap's bail. So tell A-Cap that next time... we're just going to bring all his clothes in jail so he could live there. Here. Get out of my way! Sir Macky, going up? Sir Macky, where's your date? I'm just going to get some air at the rooftop. Wow! Macky. That's his name. Oh! He's already introduced himself, ma'am? Haven't I told you? We have been chatting. And he always reads my article twice a week. So, he added me in his messenger. He also wants to have his own restaurant someday. He's a good cook, grew up in the States, 511", very fashionable and handsome! Ahh! You've seen him via web cam? Nope. That's just what I got from talking to him. Ahhh. So he said he's handsome? No. I just have a feeling. His name sounds so handsome. Macky, Macky, Macky. Why am I imagining a fat guy with a huge belly? Maybe you know someone with the same name with a huge belly. Anyway. I know now! I really have an idea who he is. Oh ma'am, be very careful. You know that there are a lot of fools this time. He maybe casting a spell on you. Hmmm. That's delicious. Oh, I meant, it looks delicious. But I don't like sweets. That's all yours. Thank you. But, I'm keeping this. Pull over right there, mister. Here. Thank you! I hate it when it's coding. What an unlucky day! - Good morning everybody! - Good morning. Good morning Macky! Have you had coffee? Not yet. Here's the roasted pork we ordered! You're such a bully! Good morning. Good morning. How's our inventory? Everything's okay, chef. She's here! Come on guys! Let's go! - Thank you ma'am! - Thank you. You have a really good taste, chef! Go on a diet first, Mack. Do you know that the treadmill has already been invented? Best friend, don't get affected. If you really want Niña, never give up. Why? You're deserving! Make her feel your love. Go! Can I hug you? Ouch! Back to work! We have lots of things to do. Okay, okay. Back to work. Enough. I said enough. Ordering pan-seared fish with tomato sauce. Coming right up. Do it! Sorry Macky! Sauce! Toss it. What's up, Tolits? Are you done? Yes. Tolits, look at this. Work of art! Maybe you'd like to add some balloons? Stop bullying him. He's just in love! Good morning ma'am. Here's your order. Pan-seared fish in tomato salsa. Thank you Honey. You're welcome. Enjoy your food. Yeah! Ma'am, what's step number four again? Oh sorry, I forgot. Come on, ma'am! Motivate yourself! Okay! - Five o'clock okay? - Yes sir. Handsome. You know what, I dreamt last night that I was eating dung. Yuck! Those are lucky dreams Aira! I also want to have those kinds of dreams. Oh, maybe that means you're going to Japan! You're going to be a dancer in Japan? Of course not, ma'am. That doesn't suit me. It's just a transfer ma'am. We have a branch there. I really hope they choose me. - Ahh. - Okay ma'am, ten counts! What am I going to do when you're gone? I don't have a P.T. That's not going to happen, ma'am. I'm not going to leave unless you take my five steps seriously. I've memorized them. Really? Okay, what's step number two? Hmmm... Start today ma'am! That's step number two, okay? - Start today. I know. - Okay, game. Two more sets. That's too much! Okay, three more. Aha! It's not me. Dear Nina... I can't wait to meet you tonight, Macky. Ma'am, are you sure? Come on Aira, I'm so sure of that. I've been waiting for the right guy to come. And I think, he's the right one for me. He's shy but sweet and he seems educated and smart. And he's handsome! What else should I look for, right? Ma'am, what if... what if he's not handsome? What are you taking about? He's really handsome! So it's okay with you that... What's that? Okay, what do you think ma'am is his weight? Oh Aira! That has always been your concern. Sorry ma'am! I'm just thinking of getting him as my client. I'm still quite short this month. Don't worry. I'm going to recommend you to him. Of course, those kinds of bodies should always be maintained! Mom, her trainer caught me! She might tell her! Don't mind her trainer. She's not important. What is she likes slimmer men? Macky, remember, women don't get attracted with looks. What matters to us is the heart. And you have a very big heart, Macky. There's nothing to worry about, okay? You're right, mom. Sir, sir. I forgot to discuss with you. I have a program. Here. It's called "Five Steps on How to Lose Weight". No, thanks. I'm not interested. But sir, you have to work out! But I'm not trying to lose weight. Oh sir, overweight men are more prone to diseases. It doesn't mean that I'm unhealthy just because I'm fat. That's because you're still young, sir. - Miss, miss... - Just call me, sir. I'm happy with my life now. Okay? - Okay? - No sir. Sir, sir. Wait sir. What now? Is that what you're going to wear in your date tonight? Of course not. You know sir, your eyes look nice. Try wearing blue or dark brown. It looks good on you. Ma'am Niña. - Hello! - Good evening. This way please. Ma'am, your waiter will be with you shortly. - Thank you. - Okay. Uhm, excuse me, sir. Do you have a reservation? Yeah, I'm Macky Cordova. That's my date over there. Oh. Ma'am Niña. Okay, this way please. Uhm, how long has she been waiting? She just arrived. Hi Niña! These are for you. I'm Macky. I'll leave you two alone, sir. Enjoy your date. Are you okay, ma'am? What? Wine? Yes, yes. Uh, uh, thanks for the flowers. Oh please. Sit down. I guess you didn't expect me. Yes. Uh, no. Actually... Never mind. Sit down. Shall we order? Yeah, sure. Macky? Macky? My god! Ma'am? Are you alright? Let us help you. And here's the very famous video that is spreading in the Internet... and in cellphones today. Oh! Poor man. He's so heavy! Help me. Help me. And because you're helpful, the poor socialite got squished. Daddy! Help! Please man, start losing weight. Please! - My phone's broken, mom. - Why is your voice like that? How was your day? - I have to go. It's breaking again. - Hello, hello? Macky? - Macky, are you still there? - I'm losing signal. - Hello? Macky? - I'll just text you okay? So that's why he's been absent lately. It's the fault of that chair! It chooses size. Chairs should also have sizes. - Sizes six, seven, eight. - We shouldn't have tolerated it. We already know that he's very big. - Stop talking, bro! - Don't interrupt me! Macky's here! Ouch! Bro. I just came here to say goodbye. I just filed my leave of absence. It's just a girl, bro. You're going to forget about this. Bro. I'm sorry. I wasn't able to text you. But I'm leaving for Bangkok today. Sorry ma'am, I'm also going to say goodbye. I look so ugly there. Gosh! I heard, he lives in the same building. It's so awkward when we see each other again! Everybody wants to interview me now. Have you read the blogs lately? They all hate me. Maybe daddy's right. When I leave now, this thing's going to pass. I thought you already know he's fat? You knew? I just thought you're okay with it. Aira? Why did you even think I could fall for someone like him? Sorry ma'am. I just thought... Uhmm... I didn't know. Oh, so when is he going back? Here he is. - Sir, wait up! - What? Yes, I'm obese! I'm not healthy! I'm sure I'll die young! But I won't avail of your program, okay? Hello Macky, how are you? Mom, I just came from the laundry. How come you're not answering my calls? Macky, just come home here in Ilocos. Hello Macky? Are you still there? Mom, I think it's time I get some help. Hey, that's mine. Excuse me, can I ask something? Sure, what is it? Is this De Jesus Street? Oh, it's still a bit far. Oh! The road going there is quite narrow. You wouldn't be able to drive your car there. If you want, you can ride in my pedicab. I have a ride! Ugh. Ugh. It's really hard here. It's going up. My daughter told me... it's because we're fighting against gravity. Ah. Do you want me to pedal instead? No. I'm okay. Aira! Hey Oca... Oca, get up! Your daughter has a visitor. Aira! Your legs are wide open! It's so embarrassing. Ah sir! Please, have a seat. I just came from the gym. They told me it's your day off. I talked to your friend. Oh, that's Gela. It's a good thing you didn't have a hard time going here. I think your mom's the one who had a hard time. Not really sir. But that's good sir! You've decided to lose weight! Mom! I'll leave you two. The tire got soft. Aira, can I hire you as my personal trainer? Of course sir! I'm just waiting for you! I promise you, when you finish my program... no one's going to laugh at you anymore. Dad! Sir, sit down. I'll just get you a drink. 303 pounds. We can do this sir. You know sir, in my three years of personal training... I've already devised my own program. Five Steps of Losing Weight. First step, goal-setting. To lose weight? Very good! Sir, it's important for you to know why you want to lose weight. Are you doing this so you can spite Niña and show her what she's missing? So when you see each other again, she'll say, "Oh is that Macky?" "He's so handsome! He's so gorgeous!". Are you doing this so she'll regret what she did? So you'll make her think until she finally realizes... that it's you who she really loves? And she'll say, "I'm so stupid! Why did I let Macky go?". And then she's the one who's going to beg. She's the one who's going to cry. Until she begs you to get back to her because she cannot live without you. Correct! Wrong. Sir, if that's your reason then I'm not going to accept this job. I'm just going to resign. - Huh? But. - Sir! I can accept it if you tell me that... you're so tired of wearing extra large t-shirts... and that the cabs don't want to pick you up anymore. And that you want to reach your toes. That's valid. Anything, as long as it's for yourself. You're right. I don't want to wake up having a hard time breathing. I don't want people thinking that all I do is eat. I'm not a slob. You know, I work as hard as anybody else. - That's what I'm saying. - Maybe even harder. Yes! Correct! And for that, you have 30 minutes here... and 180 pounds... see you soon. Go! Go, go, go! My whole body aches. Hmmm. Aira? Am I already late? We're not going to go to the gym today. Part of exercise is diet. Chicken, lean meat and salmon are okay. You should also eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Actually, you can really eat up to five or six times a day. Eat everything you want during breakfast but during dinnertime... you can only have one meal. Cereal or oats only. And one cup only. Okay? You should also avoid foods with high sugar and cholesterol. You should also start today. Not later, not tomorrow, but today! Okay? That's the second step. There's no easy way to lose weight. No shortcuts. That's step number three. I can't avoid this happiness... when I get near to you. I can't fight this feeling... when I'm near you. I'm getting crazy out of too much happiness. I'm getting shy whenever you're around. I'm feeling better... with you, my love. I can't avoid this happiness... when I get near to you. I'm getting crazy out of too much happiness. I'm getting shy whenever you're around. I'm feeling better... with you, my love. Just one smile, just one glance, just one cuddle... just one embrace, just one kiss, I'm falling for you. Just one smile, just one glance, just one cuddle... just one embrace, just one kiss, I'm falling for you. Just one smile, just one glance, just one cuddle... just one embrace, just one kiss, I'm falling for you. Higher, Macky! That's good. Okay, other one. Let's try, okay? I'm getting crazy out of too much happiness. I'm getting shy whenever you're around. I'm feeling better... with you, my love. I'm getting crazy out of too much happiness. I'm getting shy whenever you're around. I'm feeling better... with you, my love. - What? Thanks. For what? Because you don't just try to make me look... lighter. It's hard! But you made me feel better. You made everything easy for me. Can I just ask? Did your mom bring company? No. It's just her. Why? Oh, maybe she is... That's her! Mom! Hi. How are you? How are you too? I'm good. Come in, come in, come in. I should've been here hours ago! But then... Ah, mom. This is Aira. Aira, this is my mom. Oh, hi. So you're Aira? Yes. Mom, take a seat. No, don't worry about me. What did you cook? Well! I prepared Italian. We have the enselada orientale. - We have the sopa crema de champiniogne. - Let me help you. And for the main course, we have herb-roasted chicken. And for dessert, I made your favorite. Crème de tropicale. Wow, I'm so hungry! Come on, let's eat. Ah, Macky, I have to go now. I'm already needed at the gym. Don't leave yet. You have to eat. I'm sure Macky cooked for three, right? Well, I actually cooked for two. And a half. I'm the half. I want to cut down on my food intake starting today. But if Aira won't eat, I'll have to start tomorrow. Is that the case? Well then, I'm going to eat. Yehey! What about you Aira, do you cook? No, no. So how was your flight? It's so hot. My flight is delayed. I should have been here earlier. Thank you. There. Salad. Here Macky. - Here. - It's still hot. - Good evening ma'am. - Good evening. Your towel, ma'am. - I'll come back. - Okay. Aha! What are you eating? Have you forgotten what I told you? Step number four, motivate yourself! Get inspired so you can... - go back to your goal. - Move away. She's back. Who? Niña. The problem with you is you let yourself get affected. That's easy for you to say. You don't look like me. You weren't the one who got embarrassed. That's another thing. You're so insecure. Give that to me. You know what? Don't I have the right to be insecure? Anyway, you won't understand. You're not overweight! I mean, you can go on a blind date and not get laughed at on You Tube! Come to think of it you probably don't even need to go on a blind date. - What? - Maybe a lot of people like you. But me, I have to follow your five steps just so other people can notice me. Pathetic. Hey! For your information, nobody's courting me. So don't think that all the misfortunes in the world are with you... just because you're fat! There! You said it! What? That I'm unlucky because I'm fat. - That's not what I meant. - You just said it! You're just like Niña! Hey! I'm not like Niña! And wait a minute, this isn't about me! This is about you. You're right! It's about me being a loser, right? You know what, you're not funny anymore. Fine. All the misfortunes in the world are with you because you're fat. But you know what, everyone has his own misfortune. Like me. I'm unfortunate to be born poor. But what am I going to do? I'm going to work, right? I'm going to fix things instead of complaining. But you. Look at what you're doing to yourself. When you're done with your tantrums, go back to step one. If you can't do it... then just don't go back to the gym. Your sister's pregnant. Here's your ticket, Aira. Your flight's next week. Hey! Just look for a slim guy with no frills. I just want to see the progress of the guy. Oh come on, chubby chaser! I don't believe you. Do you want to see him when he's slim... getting chased by the woman who turned him down before? That's painful. Fly now! Fly! - Tomorrow, let's train your lower back. - Okay! - Let's resume tomorrow. - Aira... someone's looking for you. There. Wait, Aira! - I want to finish your five steps. - You haven't even finished step one. Aira, I got your point. I can't base my happiness on whether or not the person likes me or not. I should like myself first. I tried to continue without you but I got stuck on step four. I couldn't find my inspiration to continue. And that's why I'm here. You're the one who inspires me. For you. Enough with the drama! Let's go. Let's check your weight so we'll know how big the damage is while I was gone. Let's go! 297. - Two hundred ninety seven! - Yehey! You're so good! Five pounds! Thank you! Thank you! Ouch! Yahoo! Here it is. Time to eat! Hey! Just tell me when it's all gone. Macky, open your eyes. This is the fifth step. Be happy. You're going to eat. I thought you're testing me. Of course I know you're getting tired of your diet! Besides, it's bad to deprive yourself with food. You're just going to eat more. So now, you're going to eat. You know, you're prettier when you're happy. Really? Stop pulling my leg! No really! You're already smart and funny. Plus you're a good daughter and sister. So when you smile like that, whooo! You're fooling me again. But then, you're unlucky. Why? You're with a fat guy. Hmmmm. Look, look! Look at that girl in the other table. She's cute, right? Why? - Is she your crush? - Of course not! She's your crush! - She's your crush! - Stop it. Look, come on! She's cute, right? She's going to fall in love with you. Okay. Let me ask you. Will you fall in love with someone like me? Who knows? Oh. Someone's going to perform a magic trick. Wow! Can you do that? Here. You can't do it! Wait. I can do it. You can't do that. - Give me that. Let me do it. - I can do it. You're not a magician. You're a cook. You won't be able to do it. I can't do it myself! Here. You know, I want to be a magician. Me, I want to have my own gym. And I want to have my own bakeshop. I thought you want to be a magician. Magician with a bakeshop. You're going to treat me here! All you can eat. - Promise? - You'll be my most special guest. Sure, but frowning is forbidden there. So you should always smile. Yeah. I'm going to miss you. I'm leaving. I'm going to Japan. Will you stay there for long? A bit. I need to. We have another addition to the family. Hmmm. You'll miss me, right? Yes. Let's go. Let's get inside. No. I just wanted to bring you home. One for you and one for me. Souvenir. Will I still see you? Of course! We have a workout tomorrow! Last workout? Yes. Go! Just think that you want to lose weight. That you want to breathe easily. You want to reach your toes! You can do it! Go! - You can do it! - You're so unfair! Why? It's always me. Okay, let's switch. What you're doing is wrong. Come here. You're doing it wrong that's why you're having a hard time. The pressure should be here. You know, there's no fun in Japan. It's cold there. I'm going to bring a jacket. Your nose will bleed... I can take the weather there. ...out of speaking English! Hey! I know how to speak English! The food there is raw. You're going to miss my cake. And... You don't want me to leave, right? Enough with your rest! Is it me who wants to lose weight? Come here. Quick. Do what I just did. Game, game, game. Can I stop you? Stop it! You have to go, right? I'll just go to Ilocos. Let's just leave together. I think it's going to be good for me if I leave for a while. There's no more reason for me to stay. Is it because of...? Well, it's because you're not here anymore. Why are you bringing a fork? Don't they use chopsticks there? Mom, just keep it there. Be careful with Japanese men! Don't let them fool you. Yolanda got pregnant there. Mom! I'm going to work in a gym, not in a club. Yeah, just a reminder. This is the first time you're going to be away. Hey A-Cap, don't be silly here! I'm just going to call from time to time. Sis, I'm really going to miss you. Size 10, okay? I knew it! Come here, come here. You always have something to ask for! But hey, A-Cap, listen. Once I learn your misadventures. I'm going to fly back to pinch your thing! Ahhh! Ouch! Oh, mom is getting emotional again and longs to be cuddled. Come here, mom. Come, come. Quick! - Hey! - Ayyy! Ouch! Don't surprise me! You look like weird there! Wait, I have something to give you. Here, you'll be able to use this. I gathered this for you. It will help you. I'm sure, when you come back... you're going to ignore me because you have lots of yen already! It's you who's going to ignore me because you're already slim by then. That won't happen. Here you go again. You should believe that you're going to be slim! I mean, it won't happen that I'll ever ignore you. You take care. International. Domestic. Bye! I'm going to miss you. I just want to tell you how much I like you. Very much. You don't have to say anything. Me too. What? I like you too. Well, I'll send you e-mail everyday. Send me your number when you get there, okay? And you text me. I'm going to reply but not through text, okay? That's expensive. I don't care if I get lost there as long as I find an Internet shop. Really? Yes. Well, I guess this is it. I have to come in. It's my first time so I might get lost. Sure... Sure, bye. Bye. Bye. What's wrong? Do we have a problem? What happened? What? Nothing. I'm just happy for you. You're so handsome! I hate you! Come here, come. Stop it. Your girlfriend might get jealous of me. I'm just panicking. No, don't! If I were you, I'd panic even more. Joke! You can do it. I'm sure she'll love this. Promise. Sir Macky, ma'am is here. She's here. Okay. Go! Hi. Nins... I know that things are a bit crazy lately. You know, at the restaurant and all... We're both stressed... Most of the time... always mad. That's why I want this night just for the two of us. I want us to have a great time. Happy first anniversary. Happy first anniversary. Your first magazine cover and article. I gave dad a copy right away. Though it's not yet too perfect. Because you can still improve your pose. And the style. But it doesn't matter. It's still you. Did you know that even the press thinks... that you are the one who's following dad's footsteps? And I'm sure he'll be so happy to know that his training on you is paying off. He made the right choice. Well, I made the right choice. The next, biggest restaurateur. Nice, right? Nins, don't you think it's kinda early to say? I still have a lot of things to prove to your dad. Mack, we've been managing Herbert's pretty well. As long as we keep dad happy, there's no problem. And I'm sure you won't let anything go wrong, right? Oh. And by the way, dad wants us to meet some investors from Cebu tomorrow. He thinks that we can entertain the idea of setting up a branch there. - Right after that, we can go to - - There they are. There. Ma'am, sir, there's a problem. You should've understood. You love meddling with my business! If there's something I hate, it's traitors like you! Stop it. Don't think you don't know what you're doing? You're destroying my image to our staff! You don't have to backstab me. You are so ambitious! You want to steal my position! Hey! I said... This is what's right for you! Why did you let Uncle Anton leave? You know he's been dad's friend since college, right? What are we going to do when dad finds out? What is he going to tell us? He's unfit to manage the kitchen. You saw how arrogant he was. I'm sure Uncle Bert will understand. But he still delivers. Now, tell me. How are you going to tell dad about this? How are you going to manage his temper? Nins, are we fighting again? It's our anniversary. Can we just for once forget about your dad... and trust my decision? - Yes dad. - Why did you Anton go? I tried to tell him dad. Where's Macky? He's here. - Macky. - Uncle Bert. You know that Anton is a good friend. But sir... Make sure you can run the place without him. Yes sir. - Don't disappoint me Macky. - Yes. - It's all in your hands now. - I'm going to answer for Sen. - I'm counting on you. - I will. It's up to you now. That's your call. I'll make it up to you next time, mom. I promise. You always say that. What if you already have a family? We won't really be able to see you. Mom, I'm going to come home next Christmas. Christmas? Christmas just passed Macky. Oh right. Well, I'll come home some other time, okay? You're stressing yourself too much. You don't have a sense of time. Crap. Why? Mom, I missed my turn. I'll call you later. Right. You even don't have a sense of direction. Take a rest now. Good night Macky! Good night, mom. I'm sorry Nins. I'll call you when I get home okay? - Okay, bye. - Bye. Here. Thank you. Run guys! Quick! Hey! Don't leave me! I know you. You have no shame! The neighbors might be gossiping about us! They might think that I have a son who's a criminal. Don't worry, mom, I'm sure they knew it even before. Your sister's here. You're dead! - You're dead, A-Cap. - What's this again? There. That's yours. Mom, what's this? You have to go to that address. A-Cap and his gang stole some car parts. They were able to return some but the tire has already been sold. I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention. My friend's father is sick... and he needs money to buy medicine. If not, the father might die. But the guy is handsome, you can date him and be your boyfriend. And I hope the guy with the car becomes Aira's boyfriend. What boyfriend are you talking about? At last Aira, you're going to have a boyfriend! Hey sexy! I knew it! You missed me. Gela, how much did we earn today? Here. Just this? Hey! Wait a minute, you have a date? How did you know? Your mother called. It's not a date. We're going to compute the damage I have to pay. I wonder how much it would cost. Oh yeah, Rosie passed by. She's asking us to pay the rent. But wait, I heard he's handsome and his car is really expensive. - I'm so giddy! - You're always like that! Women are all the same. You only look at the face and the wallet. So what do you want us to look at? Yuck! Thanks. Macky?! I can't believe it. I thought you won't recognize me. So what's new? Aside from your hair? What's new? I was able to save. I got a loan to operate a gym. Actually, we've been open for four months. We're turning five. But you, how are you? Are you a model? No, no, no. I'm managing a restaurant, with my girlfriend. So you already have a love life? Who? Oh of course, I don't know her. Actually, you know her. You're so good! So how's your family? They're okay. They already miss you. Really? Yes. They will all be surprised when they see you. I'm going to visit them. That's so nice. Look, there's a fountain! Let's go there. Aira? - Nins, look who's here. - Aira! Ma'am! How are you? You've been away for so long. I feel so good to see you. Can you believe it? We're together now. Niña was the one who courted me. And talking about karma... falling in love with someone who used to love you. It's a good thing that he wasn't completely over me. Oh, has he told you how we met? Not yet, ma'am. She was having a shoot in Ilocos. Sir, Sir Bert is calling you. Oh, please tell him I'll be there in a while. Mack, don't keep dad waiting. Go. I'll take care of Aira. Okay. Excuse me. So there. Anyway, he's quite chubby then and he's so snobbish... even if we always eat in his aunt's restaurant. But it didn't take me long to realize who he was. By the way, I heard about Anton. It's your call as a manager. But I'll be expecting more from you and your friend, the new chef. And just to remind you... my parent's 50th wedding anniversary is very near. You know that. I invited all my friends in politics and all our relatives. That'll be a big opportunity for us. I'm hoping everything's going to be okay. Even without Anton. Can I count on you, Macky? Good. Where's Aira? She just left. I didn't know she already has a gym. Oh, wait. She left this. You didn't tell me that you got robbed yesterday. Next time, you tell me, okay? Good morning, Aira. Good morning, Ma. Did you see Gela? I haven't seen her. I just got in because the door was open. Is that okay? Huh? When did this start? Just last night Ai. I'm sorry, I didn't know that I can fall for this hideous guy. But I really love him. You know you're the only one I love. - Promise? - Promise. Hey, are you okay? Tell me the truth. I just thought it's still possible. I thought I can make it up to him. It's too late. You know how it feels? When I saw him, I wanted to embrace him. I wanted to tell him, "Hey, I didn't forget you". I just wasn't able to answer your e-mails. So why didn't you answer his e-mails? It only takes a few hits in the computer. Or you can text him, right? I really wanted to. But how is it possible? He's very happy with his stories. And he's very excited with what's happening with his life. Especially when he was losing weight. While you were having a lot of problems in Japan. It wouldn't be right to answer his happy e-mails with my problems. So it's better not to reply, right? And I don't want him to be sad for me. I'm okay with the fact that one of us is happy. Oh, it's all cheeks. Wait. Uyyy! Macky? Aira! I didn't notice that this is Macky! He's so handsome! So gorgeous! Hey! That's too much. I'm just having fun. I just want to return this. No, no. That's yours, right? No. Take it. You think I brought you to the restaurant to make you pay? Didn't you? No. I really wanted to see you. Take it, Ai. Come on. Take it. A lot of things have changed here. Yeah, you smell so good. Oh yeah! A lot of things have changed here. And it's all because of Aira. Have you seen her new gym? Oh, you haven't? Come on. Quick. I'll tour you! Hey, hey, hey. She will tour you. Aira. Aira is on her way there, right Aira? Yes Mom. Wow! So this is it. You already have a gym. Dream come true. Hey! That's Gela. Wow! Hey, sorry I wasn't able to ask your permission. I put your picture because those are our past and present clients. Is it okay? I'm so fat here. What are you talking about? You're so cute! I look so different now. Of course, you're big time now. You're a manager. You have Ni - And besides-- - You're more handsome now! Hey... All thanks to you. You know what? - This calls for a celebration. - What? Let's go out? Us? Ma'am Nina might look for you. Ai, I insist. This is my treat. For old time's sake. - Hi Macky, I'm so happy to see you. - Cheska. - Hello. - Good to see you too! Hey dude, what's up man? It's hot. It's hot in here. Let's go, let's dance! Come on! Come on! Since when did you become so shy in dancing? - Come on. - No no. Show them your moves. Like this. It's so embarrassing! Since when did you say no to me in dancing? Come on! Show them your moves. Why? Have you really changed? Is it because you're handsome now? You've changed. You're a snob now. Me? A snob? You're the snob. Since when? When you stopped answering my e-mails and texts. Hey, I sent you e-mails. You didn't reply. Really? When? I sent you e-mail last year. You didn't reply. When I came home, I went to Flavors but you're not there anymore. I was with Niña already. Ah... I called you. Hmmm, when? Before Niña and I got together. I thought you're going to come home. Ahhh... My contract got extended. Yeah, I almost followed you there. To Japan? Good for you. It's good that you bumped your head, right? What? It's good that you bumped your head, right? Yeah. It's okay, right? What? Everything that happened. You got the gym you wanted. I became a manager. I'm now with Niña. Things are better now, right? Yeah. Everything's okay. Why? Nothing. I just really missed you. Please never leave again, okay? I don't like this wine. Where's Macky? Dad, he just fixed something. - If you want dad, I can do it for him. - He's the one I want. He's supposed to be the one on top of this. Dad, he suddenly felt sick so... Niña, you know how important this party is for us. You have to remind your boyfriend to start working. I don't want to get the impression that he's losing interest. Yes dad. Your order sir. Here it is! Ma'am. Surprise! Mack, what's this? It's comfort food. I just want us to eat. Wait, since when did you break your diet? It's okay. We have been depriving ourselves so much. So I thought, we should eat today. Let's eat. Mack, we can eat at Herbert's. We need something else to eat. Come on! You know, we can accomplish more things if we're at Herbert's. Mack... Nins, take it easy, okay? All I want for us is to have a good time. You always think of having a good time! You didn't even think of us when we faced dad. Aren't you also going to think of your body now? Now what Mack? Do you want to get fat again? I'm sorry. For not being there. And hoping you'd appreciate this. All I wanted for us is to enjoy. I just don't know what to do anymore! Did I do the right thing, Ai? Is it too much? When you were arguing with her, you didn't feel guilty. I just couldn't take it anymore. I'm getting tired. I need a release. You know what, I have been nothing but an obedient boyfriend. Everything she wants, her father wants, I follow. Go back to Step one. Why are you doing what they want? Is it because you also want it? Yes. Well then, go to Step four, motivate yourself! You have to think of ways to remind yourself... why you're doing what you're doing. You know what. I just need a break. You know? There! That's what I need. Out-of-town workout. I need Step five. I shouldn't deprive myself. I should be happy. Right, Ai? Macky! Come on, Macky! Let's swim! - Come on! - No, no. Why? Are you afraid of the water? - Come on. - No. What? Promise you won't laugh at me. Promise? Yes. Promise. I don't know how to swim. You don't find it funny? No. You know what... when I told Niña about it, she just laughed. That's okay. Let's go! Come on. Quick! Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Here. Oh no, on the other side. Let's go! We're going to jump here. Hold my hand. Come on. Ready, one, two... Go Macky, go! Yey! You still have it. What? That gift. It just happens. You just make it so easy for other people. That's my job. You're doing what you do best. Because I love my job. Good for you. Why? Aren't you happy? I don't know anymore. But for sure, I'm happiest when I'm with you. Dad, why are you still up? He brings you home more often now. Is he courting you? Of course not! Be careful Aira. He's already taken. Gela, I've been calling her. Could you just tell Aira that I called? Mack, that's not what we need. That's for bakeshops. Well, I just thought, what if we put up a bakeshop, right? I could be the pastry chef. Look, it doesn't have to be big. - I mean, we could start by -- - What are you talking about? Dad wants you to be the next him. Who knows, one day, you'll have your own hotel. That's why he's training you. Mack, we're getting there. This is our dream, right? I'm sorry Nins. I'm just... I'm asking a lot of questions right now. Watch your diet. This looks nice. What's this? Nothing ma'am. Can I have this? Is it okay? By the way, my grandma's wedding anniversary's this weekend. Dad's hoping that Macky and I will announce our engagement there. You should come. I'm sorry Aira. You have a text from Macky. I already read it. Aira. Aira, stop! Look. I just want to talk. No Macky, go home. Just talk to me first. Why are you pushing me away? No Macky, stop it. Go home now. Niña is looking for you. How can I be with Niña when all I think about is you? It's true, Ai. It's crazy. I was okay until you came back. Now, all I think about is what might have been. What could have been if it was us? I wanted to be with you. I still do. Leave. Aira, no! Just go back to Niña! Let's talk first. Niña made me want to be better. I wanted to change because I wasn't good enough for her. But you. You've changed something in me. You make me feel good inside. You make me happy inside. Please tell me you want to be with me too. I can't love you anymore. I could have loved you before. But now, I can't. Is this about Aira? Yes. But it's also about us. Nins, even without Aira... I don't think I can be the man... you want to spend the rest of your life with. - Mack, maybe we can fix this? - That's our problem Nins. I always fix myself for you. Mack. Do you know how it feels to not be loved by the one you love? That's how I felt for you. So I changed my life for you. I wanted so badly to be right for you. I wanted you to love me. Because you are my dream. I thought when you'll love me, I'm going to be happy. I was wrong. Because I don't know if you would still love me... if I'm not perfect anymore. But I love the Macky I'm seeing now. Mack, I love you. Nins, will you still love me if I get fat? I'm sorry Niña. Mack, please don't do this. Everyone's going to be there tomorrow. I don't want them to feel sorry for me. Mack, please don't do this to me. Please, not now? We'll talk about this again, okay? Hurry up. I'm almost done, dad. Hey A-Cap, hurry up! I'm fixing the table now. - Oh Aira, you're there. - Hi Aira! Let's eat. Good morning! What's happening? Sorry Ai. I'm just really concerned about you so I told them. Are you okay now? Hey, what Aira did was right. She doesn't need a man to make her happy. Come on, what do you think will make your daughter happy? We're here! Come on Dad! All we give Aira are headaches. Let her go! You already made her an ATM. She will become an old maid. Niña loves Macky. Macky loves Niña. They love each other. - So you guys don't care if they're together. - But he also said he loves me. What? You witch, you just told me that you let him go... because he will propose to Niña. Did you tell him you love him? No! I let him go, remember? - You're stupid! Why didn't you tell him? - You turned your back on the blessing! Should have I told him? You have no more chance. Just keep that feeling of yours. This will just be among us. Because if you don't admit your real feelings - I'm going to regret it for the rest of my life? Correct! Am I stupid? You're more stupid if you don't do anything. So what are you still doing here? Go now! Mom! Get the pedicab ready, quick! Go Aira go! Hurry up! A-Cap, go! Go Aira! This is it, sister! You should go before it's too late! Hurry up. Is she on drugs? Oops, we're ready now! Guard, is Macky there? I haven't seen him. Is he in his unit? I'm just going to go there, I have to tell him something. Yes ma'am. Ai? Why are you here? Ahhh... because... I just need to say something. Aira, what is it? We still have to go to my grandparents' anniversary party. Ah, uhm, I just have to say something. I just want to say that... Macky loves you so much... because I witnessed it. He wants you to be happy all the time. I hope you can make him happy too. I wish that you're going to be happy together. That's it. That's it. Mack. It takes so much courage for her to say that. But we both know that she's not telling the truth, right? Thanks. Thanks so much. Go. Aira! Aira! Whatever you do, I'd be able to catch up. You trained me, remember? Whatever! Step one, goal-setting. Why did you go to the condo? Didn't I tell you? Step two, start today. Start being honest today. It's your call. It might be too late. Go away! Step number three. No shortcuts. You can't get rid of me that easily. You first accept the reason why you were there. Did you go there to tell me that, "Macky, I missed you"? "I now realized that it's you who I really love". “And I can't live without you". Or did you go there to tell me that I'm your crush? Yihee, I'm your crush? Stop it! Please! So what if you're my crush? You think you're handsome, huh? You think you're cute? When you lost your fats, you also lost who you are! You've changed! If I changed, it's all because of you. I'm a better man because of you. You're my step four. You're my inspiration. You're the one who taught me that I can be accepted and I can be loved... however I may look like. Really? You're the one who's insecure! How can I believe you? Your dream girl looks like a goddess who went down from heaven! - I'm no match! - There you go again! You're so insecure. You're worse than me when I was fat. At least I was fat. You, you have no reason to be insecure so stop putting yourself down. Aira, you're the most beautiful thing that's ever happened to my life. You are my happiness Aira. Please, let me make you happy? Are you ready for step five? Be happy. Be happy. I love you. I love you too. Come on, show them your dance! Go!
