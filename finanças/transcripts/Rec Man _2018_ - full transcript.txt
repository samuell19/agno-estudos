(upbeat music) - Yeah, I want you to try it. Good. You gotta bend your knees. There we go, just like two squares. There we go. I want you to work on some more shots. All right, there you go. You ready? Excellent. Looking good, looking good. You gonna be a world class player one day. Yes, sir. Good job, son, all right. Let's go, James. Excellent. Oh, I got it. All right, make the layup. All right. (car whooshing) - All right, babe. - You have a good time, son? - Are you kidding, Dad? You the man. - No, you the man. Give me a high-five, uh. - Hey, sweetie, hey. Hey, come here. Hey, come here, let me talk to you for a second. Okay, so I heard OCB tried to proposition you, and you dissed em'. Oh, so what, you think you're too good for OCB? (dog barking in distance) - Son, I love you. This Center is like a jewel in the concrete jungle. If you ever get tempted to get with one of these gang bangers, this Center can be your salvation. Use this Center to stay off the streets. I want you to promise me that. - Oh, okay. Don't say I didn't warn you, sweetie. Have a wonderful day. - Well, okay Dad, but you talk like you're going somewhere. - No, son. I'll always be with you. - Y'all see that trick over there? I want y'all to rob her, and rob her quick, show no mercy. You get the purse, you're in OCB. - [Maxx] Yeah, Big Brother Grimm, we got this. - Yo, we got this, OCB. - All right. - What do you think about those two? - Those two are a little too wild for me. It's gonna be the death of them one day. - You get a little older, I want you to get a membership like I have. A badge. That you're a member of this Center, okay? - Okay. - All right. Great job. Progress and doing fine, - No! - But I, - [Woman] Y'all fools better get away from me. - Son, son, there's no time to call the police. Whatever you do, don't move. - Give us the purse, now! - But, Dad. - No, fool! - Give us the purse! - No buts, son, promise me that. - No! You fools better leave me alone! - Give us the purse! - I love you, son. - Man, little did I know, that would be some of the last words my dad would ever speak to me. And the Center that he brought me to as a child will one day be the one I'd work at and try to save. To bless everyone that is performing and doing this event. Bless everyone who is here in attendance and may this be a good show. Protection around our event, and help us raise the money that we need for the show. - You know you gotta be careful, right? - Yeah. - But if anything happens, we got you. You just gotta let us know, the Baby Dolls stick together. - That's good, that's what I'm counting on. - Stay calm, you cannot let anybody know what you're doing. - Are you ready?! (cheering) - You got this? - Oh yeah. I got that down. - 'Cause they'll come get you. You don't wanna get got. (hip hop music) (cheering) Most girls, they first time, they come out a little nervous, you know? - Yeah? Not me. - Okay. - You picked the right Baby Doll for this team. - I'll trust you then, baby. - Yeah, good, all about time. - [James] Take your time. Show us the kicks! (crowd cheering) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) - Let me tell you how stupid my brother was. He was so stupid as a kid we had to get him a tutor to teach him how to scribble. Yeah he was going out of town one day saw a sign that said "Airport left" so he came back home. (laughing) (light guitar music) (phone ringing) - What up, Pete? - Hey boss. No, it's the same blonde chick I saw earlier. That she was looking at you, that's-- - Wait, wait, are you serious? - Yeah, dude I'm telling you it's the same chick. And now she's taking pictures of you. - Hey Pete, we cannot afford to let those pictures get out. I need you to take care of this. Yup, give her the business. - Sure, copy that sir. - OCB out. (whistling) (crowd applauding) (gun firing) (mumbling) (gun firing) (somber music) - No one messes with the Out Cold Boyz. - So without further ado I'd like to welcome and introduce you to some staff members here, Mr. Morris Night, Mr. Terrance Powell, come on. They're gonna, while I go check on the other acts they're gonna take the mike. - Who's ready to have a nice safe night tonight? - Hey, I see a lot of great acts out there. I want y'all to get out there, warm up those voice boxes, get them egg feet edgy and ready to dance and and do ya'll thing and let's go! It's showtime, baby! What's our next act? Our next act is, - [Steel] OCB in the house! - [Gang] Out Cold Boyz in the house! - Now watch, I'ma put it in the sun, just watch. (hip hop music) Yo, yo, yo! One two, one two and I say we are the OCB and this is a robbery! Now put your hands up! - Hey man, you all need to get out here with all that foolishness. Nobody trying to hear all that noise! - Ya'll show some respect to my my boys before we don't have to spray this joint. - Tell 'em, baby! - [James] Looking at this, they should be next. - Mr. Braxton, Mr. Braxton, the Out Cold Boyz have crashed the show, what are we gonna do? - Did you try to find Officer Ford? - He's nowhere to be found. (groaning) They got gang members! All around the building, we're hit! - Okay, think, let me think, let me think. I gotta do something before somebody else gets hurt. - Man, are you crazy? - My mom is in that audience. - Oh. - But I got a plan. (tense music) You ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. - What in the blazes is going on here? We're in the middle of a talent exhibition and gang members come in and crash it? - Stop it, you freaks! - [Steel] Pete, go get him! - That's right! (grunting) - Look, I was put in charge here today and I'm the one who had to file the incident report. - Oh you, let's see what you got! Man you almost made me drop my grape! - So I want some answers. I wanna know what happened. So what happened? All right man, you ain't gotta do that, I got it. Now you get up! Get up! Run, run! - Now wait a minute, James, step off. We don't know what happened any more than you do. - Yeah Braxton, in case you hadn't noticed, all the staff are with you. We were working while you were playing around doing flips. - Playing around? - I know that's right. Maybe if you actually did some work around here, instead of always trying to show off. - [James] Show off? - Hold on everybody. You know just as well as I do that James had to conduct the exhibition which is hard enough in itself. We need to be looking at who was in charge of the doors and that was our beloved Rec security. - Lisa's right. My bad. I apologize about us coming down on ya'll but this incident right here is very bad publicity for the Rec Center. I was the one left in charge. So I'm the one that's gonna catch it. - You're not the only one. - What's that, what? - You're not the only one. - So what that mean? - I'm the one who had to talk to management about allowing you to throw this stupid exhibition thing. (laughing) - Really? - What? - Right, really? Really. - Whatever. - [James] You're about as annoying as those kids over there. (hip hop music) (slamming) (chattering) - Everybody die, Everybody, little kids, aunt, grandma, little dogs, fish, everybody. I don't care, man. - [Man] Get up, get up. - Have a seat. Look, we didn't get jack from the exhibition heist. What's wrong with you fools? - Man you know, Steel, it was screwed up, everything went wrong. - Look, I already know that, you idiot. But why did it go wrong? I want some answers. (banging) Now! - What happened? That punk Braxton, that's what happened. - Yeah, we should have popped that fool! - Wait wait wait, wait a minute. Am I hearing y'all correct? Y'all trying to tell me that we, The Out Cold Boyz lost out on one of our biggest heists from some wack Rec instructor? See, naw, that don't cut it for me. Put that up for me. See next time he stick his nose in OCB business, this is what he gonna get. (thwacking) And this is what's gonna happen next time you all screw up again! (gun firing) You understand me?! (woman laughing) (hip hop music) - I'm disappointed in you and the staff, James. When the District finds out about this incident, they're gonna hit the ceiling. As you know, Andrew Young Center is targeted for closure due to their budget cuts. And despite our best efforts, this incident could tip the scales to those who want to close us! - Miss Warner, I'm sorry. I blew it. - James, you should have made sure that Rec security was at all the exits before you started the show! You know how incompetent those two can be. Well, I'll turn in your report. But next time, you think of the consequences before you let your guard down. In the meantime, I'm gonna see if it's possible to have another show. - Cool. Thanks Miss Warner. - James, I just can't stay mad with you. By the way, did you talk to Beavis and Butthead, our two security guards? - You mean Forrest and Ford? Those two clowns couldn't cut it with the Keystone cops. What you need to do is talk to their supervisor. - You're right. (hip hop music) - Hey yo Ford. So I heard you been kicking it with that cute little dispatcher. - Hey, where did you hear that? That's none of your business, man. - Man, I'm making it my business you old chump. - Yo, yo man, cool it! What you trying to do, make us crash or something? Hey Forrest. You know that run we made to the playground last Saturday? You know, the one that took us away from the Young Center? - Oh yeah. What about it? - Did you report that as a false alarm? - Naw man, you know them type of things just be happening. All you need to do is just keep your beady eyes on the road, goat face. (scoffing) All right man, come on now, lighten up. You know I'm just kidding with you. - So did you uh, watch the news last night, man? - Yeah, I did. You know they ain't never talking about nothing. - You heard about the Rec laying people off, right? - Yeah I heard about that. - Yeah, we might be on that list. - Well then it's time for us to get another job then. - [Ford] Not yet, no man. I think we should do I guess you know, just keep working and see what happens. Get that last paycheck, man. - No man, no man. We need to be planning something now. We could be getting fired tonight. I'm saying is you trying to roll or you trying not to? - Look man, I'm just saying though, man, I think we should just go ahead and work that last check, man and get paid for that-- - Look, look, you keep worrying about this last check. You need to be worrying about trying to get this bread. Quit worrying about that last check. I'm telling you, I got a plan for us. If you down, let's get this money. (light jazz music) (chattering) (balls clacking) - I thought you said you could play? - Yeah well we'll see who gonna win. Brother Braxton? - Yes, sir. - I heard about what happened the other day. - Yeah? - Don't let it get you down, bro. Just keep fighting for this community. - That's right, Brother James. 'Cause the seniors are counting on you! - Yep, for sure. - Get to say this place is ours. - I do. - Absolutely, Miss Howard. - 'Cause you the man for the job. - Absolutely. We ain't going out like that. - All right. - I know that's right. I know that's right baby. - You darn skippy! 'Cause us seniors, we're prepared to do whatever's necessary - That's right. - to save this place. - For sure, for sure! All right now, look at you girl, committed. - Well you know, Bro James, as an employee, I can't really do anything. I have to work at will of the bosses. But you guys, you guys can use your voices to speak out and say that the Center should be saved. - Yeah you're right yeah, you know we can. (laughing) You better say that, baby. - My voice count! - Eight ball, corner pocket. Yeah, also we should, always vote. - That's right. - That's right. [Woman] stand up and be counted... - And stand up and be counted! - That's right, right on! Right on! Hey, forget it. I won that baby. - [Woman] Did you see that? - I'm talking about. - Chess, Brother James? - Yeah I'm up for whipping your... I mean playing you in the game. (laughing) You're in my neck of the woods now. Let's see what you can do, whoop you again. Bruh, why you think they wanna close this place? - [James] Officially it's budget cuts. - Officially? Yeah I know you can't speak on it. But you probably think there's some hanky panky going on. - I really can't say. - That's okay. Because I'll say it for you. There's some hanky panky going on. Check. - I know that's right. You better believe that. - I don't know if you're right but you know what Proverbs say. A lie haveth but a short life. Checkmate. - I'll be dang... - But the truth lives on forever! Gotcha. - I heard that. - Finally beat me at something. - Amen, Brother James. - Don't take it so hard, youngster. - You know that's right, baby. - Good game. - Good game. - It's all right... (light rock music) - Start out today's kicking drill. Right, I want you boys to do some warmups, basic kick skills today, aight? Mr. Robert? - [Mr. Robert] Yes sir! (light rock music) Keee Yah! Keee Yah! - Very good man, very good, I like that. You've got power. - Thank you. - Good. Very good. (hip hop music) - [Man] Let's go, let's go! (chattering) - [Man] Kick it out, kick it out. (bashing) - Ugh, foul! Foul! Come on now. Stop, quit crying. Quit crying if we don't lose, we ain't no crybabies. It's all good. - I don't know where there jokers at, they think it's the game seven of the NBA Finals. - (laughing) Half these guys couldn't make it in the developmental league final. Even though they think they All-World. - What do you mean, there's no finals in the developmental league. - Whatever. They figure because they're outdoors they would argue less instead of having to be cooped up in the gym while they're making those repairs. Instead, they're even worse! - Even worse. (chattering over each other) (bashing) - Ball T, Ball! T, I called ball, T. That's ball. - Man, screw you. You can't take it, get off the court, little wussy. It's a man's game. - I'll smoke you for that, T. I'll smoke you for that, T.. - Try it and see. Try it and see. (whistle blowing) I-- - Whoah whoah whoah man. Chill, chill, chill. My man's right, it's his ball. So give up the rock, T. - Only rock he getting from me is in a pipe to smoke it. Punk. Screw you too, Rec Man. - [Man] Man you're arguing like females. Can y'all hurry up, bro? - I ain't going nowhere. I'm a taxpayer, I'm the one keeping this mug open. - Really? T, in the business you're in you don't pay no taxes. (laughing) - [Man] You gonna let him talk to you like that, T? - [Man] Love that, man. - I know you're not gonna take that, T. - Duh, very funny, Rec Man. If you so bad, why don't you play me one on one? Unless you the punk sissy I think you are. (chuckling) - Get a life. 'Cause you know I would embarrass you, T. - [Man] Braxton, you afraid and you know it, bro. - Come on Rec Man, play T. - Aw, you scared. - Just like I thought, you scared. At least till you play me you can get up out of here, staff. I'm running the court. - Yeah, tell him, T, you run this. - I bet you call the police 'cause that punk security staff you got won't come save your behind. - Ooh. - Tell him, T. - Alright, well, I'll play you. One on one, T. But under one condition. If I win, then you're gonna stop causing trouble inside and outside on the court every game night. - Okay, and if I win, me and my boys can run the court on hoop night. - Right. - And you'll stop interfering in our game. You shouldn't be out here anyway. - All right. So I got no problem with that. Ball up! - Let's go T. You got this, T. Where you at T? - Get that rabbit's foot out your pocket! it's just beginner's luck. Oh! It ain't over yet. In your face, Rec Man I don't think so, baby. (chuckling) Let me show you how it's done... (tires screeching) - [Woman] Damn y'all, hurry up, hurry up. (hip hop music) (bashing) - Come on man. - You fouled me man, you're on offensive foul! - Quit crying, this a man's game. - [Man] Yeah T, it's a man's game. - Let me go, you big meanie! You're a big bully! I'm gonna tell Rec Man on you! You big ape, let me go! Let me go, let me go! Let me go! (door shutting) Let me go, let me go! - You try taking it to the hole, you're dead meat, Braxton. Where you goin? Where you goin? You going out. Yeah you're stuck now. Yeah, you're stuck now, what you gonna do? - Tell you what. If I miss, you win. But if I make it, I win. - Fool, you would never make that shot. (drum rolling) (swishing) - Man, if this bullcrap is over, I wanna play some ball. My team got next, bro! - Ah, that's how you do it. That's how you do it. (hip hop music) (tires screeching) - OCB in the house! - OCB in the house! - [James] Where's Rec Security? - Okay fellas, just chill. It's this punk Braxton we want. Nobody move and we won't get nasty. - When we didn't see you inside and nobody was on duty, think we'd find you out here. Re Re, grab this fool. - Yeah, come on. I like that princess ponytail. (bashing) - [Woman] Wow, Re Re, really? (gun cocking) - See, I figured you'd try some of that kung fu crap, that's why we brought a little insurance policy. Pete! - Look, look, let him go! - Let me go! - He hasn't done anything to you! - Yeah he did. See he made the unfortunate mistake of being friends with you. That's right, Rec Man. I know jujitsu, I know karate, I know ka-razor. - [Steel] See, it's been fun, Rec Man, but you starting to get a little old and played out. (bashing) - Stop it! - Hah, Hah! - [Man] Did that hurt? - [Steel] Pete, shoot him! - Steel, the witnesses. - [Steel] Shoot him, fool! - [Woman] Get him! (bashing) God, you're an idiot! - [Steel] What the heck? (gun cocking) Come on, Maxx Out. - [Woman] Get up! - [Steel] Grab Pete! - Get up, fool! - [James] Hey look, everybody just chill. - [Steel] Come on, Maxx Out. - They got me messed up, they messed up my game! (gun firing) (tires screeching) - Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, stop T! - Rec, I'm just trying to help you out, baby. - Calm down! (tense hip hop music) - The situation yesterday was a national embarrassment to the Department, the city, the community. How yet again can y'all let another gang come invade the Center? Where was your front desk staff at? Uhhhhhh - Well. That would be me. - And where were you? - Well I went to get something to eat. My boyfriend picked me up. I kind of got a little distracted. - Can't you keep your mind on your work? - Listen, quiet, quiet, quiet, Braxton. I'ma blame all of this on you. I heard about you clownin' on the playground. You're supposed to be overseeing, not entertaining. - Yes, sir. - Yes sir? - I mean yes ma'am. - Well I don't think it's fair to put what happened solely on James. - You're right, you're right. You're right, baby girl. I'm blaming all of y'all for this little fiasco. With this type of wanton violence in the Rec Center, what was going on? Where was y'all at? Where was y'all at?! - I know. I'm not responsible for any of this. I do my job. - Yeah, flirting with one of those, crackhead... ...Negros. - Shut up, boy. That's not true. - Listen, listen, listen. That'll be enough. Now where were the rest of you all? Warner, do you not know how to run a Center? - Easy Miss Rice. Hold on now, Miss Rice, that's not fair. Miss Warner and these kids do a fine job running this Center. Why, it's the security and the police presence that's lacking. We're dealing with gangs, drug dealers, gun violence, thieves, break-ins. Where is the support from the community? Where is the support from the department? - Yeah, yeah. Ya'll don't show us no love.. That's what I'm talking about. - Listen, you people are in enough trouble as it is. It does not matter. As effective in three weeks, for those that don't know how to count, one, two, three. The Center will be shut down. - Yeah, with all due respect, Belinda, where did this edict come from? - [Belinda] Where did this edict come from? It came from Billburn himself, our Superintendent. And the way that you're running this Center, I don't see why it shouldn't be closed anyway. - Whoah, Belinda! I mean, Miss Rice. This verdict wouldn't happen to have anything to do with the fact that the city's budget is unbalanced and he's trying to make himself look good for his honor, would it? - [Belinda] No, no, no, no, no. He's not trying to cozy up next to the Mayor. This is not a political stunt. - Well it sure looks like it. - Whatever. - Listen people, listen, listen, okay? It does not matter at this point. The Center is going to be closed. We're gonna have salary staff coming in, moving equipment out. All of you all will be transferred to different Centers and then some of you might even be transferred to different playgrounds. But this is gonna happen. - The recreation equivalent of a cop walking a beat. - You got that right. - Really? Well Miss Pykes, I'll see you in the morning at my office. I'll assign you first to a different playground. - Oops. - [Belinda] Oops, guess you should've kept your mouth closed. - Well you know what, I don't know about y'all folks, I'm not going down like this without a fight. Come on! - [Belinda] Wait a minute, what you mean by that? - You'll see. - I'll see? Where my phone? - Can you believe this is happening? She's gonna change all the departments? Can you believe that? Why she wanna do that? - Man, did I hear her right? She talking about closing the Center? - Yes. With all this activity - With all this activity going on? - What's gonna happen to the kids? Where they gonna go after that? Yeah, that's what I thought. (hip hop music) - That's 75. Where the rest? - You'll get it, don't worry about it. - Hey Rev. - James. - What's going on? - I don't need to tell you what's at stake here. - No, Rev. These kids up here already wild enough as it is. And if they close this place, this is the last positive diversion they have left. What are they gonna do? - Well, I've got the Narcotics Anonymous Group praying about the situation. I'm just glad to see you and the staff not giving up on the cause. - Hey, I know how important these Rec Centers are. And this Center right here, my mom raised me and my sister up here by herself after my dad was murdered. So I know how important it is. And this Center kept me off the streets while my mom worked two jobs to support us. - So you do recognize the importance this facility has for our young people. - To say the least. This very place taught me how to fight, play several different sports, chess, checkers, martial arts, power tumping. And those are just a few to say the least. And one thing, I was even blessed enough when I was going to school that I was being scouted for scholarships. I even had a chance to turn pro. - Yeah? - Yes. - What happened? Well.. - My dad, (chuckling) Woo, my dad used to bring me up here faithfully every day. But... him being who he is and doing what he does, One day he tried to play the hero. And he tried to intervene in one of OCB's gang initiations and, it cost him his life. - Look out! - No! (gun firing) (screaming) - OCB, we out! (revving) (siren blaring) - Dad, Dad, please don't die! - Son, remember what I told you... ...arrrghh! - James, man, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. - Yeah, but you know, after OCB murdered my dad, I called myself trying to give back to the community so I became a recreation instructor. Hmmph, I must have been kidding myself. - Now what do you mean by that, James? - Well what I mean is they're gonna close this place and I feel like I'm responsible. - You know the adage "The Lord works in mysterious ways"? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Trust him. Leave it in his hands. He'll work it out. As long as you say you've done your best, that's all anyone can ask. - Hope you're right, Rev 'cause I got a lot of people putting they faith in me. But right now I feel like I let them down. - Look. Read John Chapter Two verses 16 and 17. Remember the truth will set you free and you'll never ever have to fight your battles alone. - All right man, I get it. I get it, I really do. You know if there's anybody who mastered cliche' making, it's gotta be you. (chuckling) I appreciate you. So anyhoo. What about this bible study you told me to stop in to see? - Yeah I got the perfect place for the classroom, I think we can do some, - I want you and Tamika to clean up around the building and the parking lot. Sweep it thoroughly. There's a lot of broken glass from yesterday's incident. You can get started. And when Tamika gets here, you make sure she helps you. She's always late. You can get started. (tense music) - You ignoramus! Now ask her to come over here. I'd like you to get in the vehicle, please. Yeah, Ms. Klein, give that young lady Tamika Love a coloring book or something and have her wait in my conference room. I forgot that I have another client waiting. I'll let you know when to send him in and hold all my calls. What's up with you two clowns? That incident at the park was a disgrace! - Man, Steel, I can't take it anymore. Let me blast this old fool. - Shh, brother Maxx, be cool. Let me handle this. - Yeah Brother Maxx, you better heed what the Bro has to say. As a matter of fact, I have somebody I want you to meet. Miss Klein, send in my associate. (tense music) - Hello, Lawrence. - That's Mr. Billburn to you, Mr. Hess. I have two people I'd like you to meet. Steel and Maxx Out. Leader and Lieutenant for our hired hands, OCB. - What's up? - Hello, Steel, Maxey. - That's Mr. Maxx out to you, fool. - Gentlemen, at Mr. Billburn's request I made arrangements for you and several members of your posse, if you will to be released from prison in exchange for you to do a job. - Yeah, and so what? - Well obviously the job isn't getting done. We need that Rec Center closed. Like, yesterday! - Well I told you, Mr. Hess, the Andrew Young Center is the busiest in the city. It averages-- - I don't care what it averages! We need that property. - Well, simpleton, if we close it too quick we'll bring on too much scrutiny. Give us time to execute our plan. - Yo, Billburn, we got a problem. There's a worker there. Some dude they call, Rec Man. Man, he's been causing us all kind of grief. - That's James Braxton Jr. I'm well aware of who he is. He's my employee! I see I gotta think for you idiots. - Well, Billburn, sir, I don't know what scheme you're planning. But whatever it is, you better make it happen and happen fast. You've already received a hefty downpayment. And if that Rec Center isn't delivered by August my friend, you... will be swimming with the fishes. Have a nice day. - What are you two morons laughing at? Miss Klein, send Miss Love in please. Have a seat, young lady. Young lady, do you wanna get ahead in this department? - As a matter of fact, I do. What do you have in mind? - Well there's a certain employee named James Braxton. Are you familiar with him? - Oh yeah, that guy is so dope. I swear, he can do so many things-- - Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh. Well he's a malcontent and a rebel rouser. - A rebel whoser? - A troublemaker. Let's just say if he's doing things that are not in the best interest of the Recreation Department, let's just say he's not following our agenda. - Oh really? And whose agenda is that? - We are attempting to close the Andrew Young Recreation Center. It's old, out of date, and won't be in the City's next operating budget. Braxton is an employee of ours and won't let the issue die. He is telling the people that there's a possibility that the Rec Center will remain open making our task much more difficult in closing it. - Yeah, so I've heard. But what does that have to do with me? - We need information on Mr. Braxton. And with you working at the Center, you can provide us information on his movements and his habits. - [Tamika] But I barely know him. - Look. Just report to us twice a day Braxton's movements and we'll take care of the rest. - Wait, wait a minute. Y'all not trying, y'all ain't trying to put a hit on him or something, are you? - That's aren't, young lady. And no, no, no, not at all. These gentlemen are working for me and to ensure that the Department runs smoothly and our agenda is protected. - I don't know about all this. - What's wrong little, scared little girl? - Quiet, you barbarian. This is a young lady. Don't talk to her like you're talking to your mother. - What did you say, old fool?! - [Steel] Maxx, let it go. - I'm gonna get that old man. - [Lawrence] My dear, don't you have a mother that works for the City? Ummmm, - Well. - Yes I believe you do and her name is Bernice Love. - Yes, but, - Look, young lady, let's get straight to the point. You assist us with our agenda and it'll benefit both you and your mother within the Department. - And if I don't? (laughing) (laughing) - Don't laugh too hard, you idiots. You've messed up two assignments already. Another mistake and I'm bringing in reinforcements. - Reinforcements? OCB don't need no reinforcements. - Right. - [Lawrence] Hah!, I changed my mind. You will see the Baby Dolls. - [Steel And Maxx] Baby Dolls? (chill music) - James, there's uh,..three ladies here to see you. - [James] Really? I'll be right there. Oh, ladies, ladies, ladies. One more beautiful than the next. - Hi. - Hello. - I asked to speak to who was in charge. ...looks like I got more than what I bargained for! - Oh, me, I'm just a regular old guy, you know.. (Wup) Ow! - Yeah, you sugar. I heard about you and you are fine. - Well you know, what can I say? - What exactly do you want? - Who the heck you talking to like that? Do you know who we are? - Whoa. You ain't the only one packing, fool. I got my CCW. - Whoa, whoa, ladies, ladies. I'm sorry about that Ma'am, what was your name again? - I'm Athena and we're the Baby Dolls. This is Cherie and Chocolate. - [James] How you doing, ladies? - I want to bring my niece to the Center for some activities, Kyra. - [James] How you doing? - We're just here checking things out. We don't want no trouble. - Okay, no trouble at all. But there's no gang activity inside or outside the facility. And that gun has got to go. Now if you agree to that, I can give you all the tour. - Agreed. - Okay, good. This way, ladies. (chill music) (slamming) - 75? This better just be a little part time, little deposit. Have the rest of my money soon. (car starting) (chill music) (revving) - You ready? Way ready. (revving) Let's get him... Right! (guns firing) (Tires squealing) (bang!) (Tires squealing) (revving) (tires screeching) (tense music) (Tires squealing) (revving) - Go, go! (tires screeching) (revving) (revving) (Tires squealing) Man, they're gaining on me... (revving) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (chill music) (light music) - [Mom] James, oh my God! are you okay? - I'm all right, Mama. - Oh my God, oh my God! - I'm all right! - James, what the heck is wrong with you? Why do you keep fighting these dangerous gangbangers? - Mama, it wasn't my fault. - Yeah, uh huh, I get it. You just won't let it go. You just always have to be the hero. I told you to leave that Center after that exhibition. And now these people are trying to kill you! I already lost your father prematurely. And I'm not gonna lose you too! - Ma, I was-- (slap!!!) - Don't but mama, me. I don't care if you're grown or not. I'll make you wish OCB had got a hold of you. Are you trying to give me a heart attack? - Ma, I know you upset, just calm down! - Upset? Upset is not the word! Look. I started coming down to this Center to support you. Yeah and to teach my little aerobics, and to teach it to the senior citizens. I wanted to be there for you. I want to have your back. But now these crazy people got me too scared to even leave my own house! - I'm sorry you had to go through this. But look, I cannot let the City close that Center without putting up a fight. You raised me and sis at this Center. And you said yourself you wouldn't have known what you would have down without the Rec. And I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have it either. I'd probably be one of these gangbangers out here I'm fighting. - James, listen. Let it go. That's the past. - Here we go. - Look, you can go to another Center. You can get another job. But I can't bear the thought of losing you to this senseless violence! Like, - Like what? - Like I lost your father! (sobbing) - Ma. Ma. Mama.. - [Mom] No. - Momma, look. It's gonna be all right. I filed a police report with the police. They let me go without any charges. I was talking to a detective named Watts. He said that he was gonna put the Center under special attention. Please, Momma, please. Stop crying, nothing is going to happen. - Really, James? How can you be so sure? - How can I be so sure? How can I be so sure? Woo, It's the good Lord! The Good Lord, he gon see me through. (laughing) - Boy, you crazy, just like your daddy. - Sometimes, sometimes. - But promise me that you'll use every precaution. - I promise, Ma. I love you. - [Mom] And I love you too. - All right, everything is all right. - Now get out of here before I change my mind! Oh wait a minute. Before you go, you want something to eat? - You mean some of Mama Braxton's famous home cooking? You need say nothing but a word! - Mhmm. And if you behave, for dessert, I'll give you a slice of my homemade apple pie. - All right, let's eat. - I love you baby. - I love you too, Momma. (tense hip hop music) - Hurry up and take the picnic bag out and do the block party like you were told. If you don't leave now, you will be late. What are you waiting on? - You never gave me keys to the van. - And make sure you put gas in that van! Thank you. (keys clacking) (phone ringing) - Hello, who's speaking? - Hello, is Warner in? - Who this is? - Brown, is that you, dummy?! Put Warner on the phone! - All right, all right. Chill, Belinda. Yo, Miss Warner, telephone! - Kenny, stop yelling. Out. Out. Hello, Miss Warner speaking, how may I assist you? - Warner, hello. You need to make sure that you train your staff in phone etiquette. Is Braxton there? - I'm sorry, Belinda. Do you want to speak with James? - Look, no, no. I don't wanna talk to him. Just tell him that the fundraiser exhibition that he wanted is back on. - Oh my God, that is great news. Could you tell me, why did they change their minds? - Never mind that, Warner. Just make sure you relay the message. - Man, that woman is so rude. Hmph, I wonder what the Superintendent is up to. (tense hip hop music) (light rock music) (chattering) - Naked? What? - No way. - All right, attention, attention everybody. Everyone quiet, can I please have your attention, everyone? On the behalf of Mrs. Warner and the Center, Miss Warner was called away. Me and Lisa Barnes have some information that we feel we would like to share with you all. I think you'll be interested in it. And miraculously, we have received another chance from the City Administration to have another fundraiser to save the Center! (crowd cheering) I know, now remember. - Yes! - Despite what happened at the last fundraiser, partially due to the public outcry, they're gonna give us one last chance. (crowd cheering) Yeah, yes, you like that? - That's what I'm talking about, yes! - Yeah, that's what we need, baby. - Wait a minute, James. At first the Administration vowed to shut us down then they're giving us a second chance? It sounds too good to be true. - Miss Barnes has a point. There's word on the street that your Superintendent is involved in some corrupt dealings in City Hall. Now I know you all can't talk about that but I don't work for Recreation. - You just use the building. Hey, anybody here got a dollar? - [Kids] No, no! (chattering) - [Woman] Calm down, everyone please calm down. - Listen here, everybody. Quiet, old Luke! Listen everybody, listen everybody. What difference does it make? This might be our last chance to save our jobs. - You're right, that's very true. Please please, one at a time, one at a time. - Rec Man! - [James] Yes. - What if those thugs, the Out Cold Boyz crash the party? - Okay little Jake, I'm concerned about your concerns but I was guaranteed that were gonna have police here this time. Uniform and undercover. (clapping) Besides our beloved Rec Security. (laughing) - [Woman] Oh boy! - Sounds slim shady to me. - [Women] Sounds shady to me too baby. - I agree. I agree, but hey look. Why would Billburn be opposed to us having additional security? - Yeah but do anybody, do anybody here have a dollar? (kids chattering) No, Naw, No Oh I'm outta here. All this community stuff, I can't get a dollar. - Wait. Don't worry about old Lou. He'll be back. Let's stay on point. James. - Yes. - What about our talent/showcase/fundraiser? How's that looking? - Well Lisa, I'm glad you asked. Because the Mini Models on A Mission are ready! (cheering) Everybody's ready! Look. You all have done such an outstanding job, give yourselves a round of applause! (clapping) Even our sweep team has done a good job. - Oh all right there, yeah! Good job, sweep team! - All right, but there's one more piece of business and I am proud to announce that if advanced ticket sales are any indication to what we've been trying to do, then we have reached our goal. 50 Gs, baby! (cheering) Yeah! - Show me the money baby, show me the money! - Hey, and I'd like to thank my mom and her step class. I'd like to thank all the seniors who helped make this possible. - Yes, yes. - [James] You all have done such an outstanding job. We're gonna save our Center. - Save our Center! - [All] Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! Save our Center! (light music) - We ain't friends, man. Here's the rest of your money. It's all there, you ain't gotta count it. - All right, bet.. Hit me up, Wesley. (jazz music) (sighing) (phone chiming) - Hello, Detective Watts. - Hello, Detective Watts. This is Mr. Billburn of the Recreation Department. - Oh, how are you, Lawrence? I received your email about the fundraiser at the Andrew Young Center. - Oh good, good, good. Just let you know, there's been a change. - Oh. - I have allowed the Director of the Center, Miss Helen Warner and her instructor, James Braxton to hire their own private security company for their event on the evening of the 30th. And talking with the Mayor, we have decided that with the private security company and the Recreation Security, your officers could be better utilized somewhere else. - Lawrence, I, - That's Superintendent Billburn to you, sir. - Okay, Superintendent Billburn. Are you sure you wanna do that? The Andrew Young Center is a hotspot for the Out Cold Boyz, one of the city's most notorious street gangs. And you are aware that they crashed the last fundraiser. - So what? - So what? That gang could have killed someone and those two jokers on your security team couldn't have stopped them? Also I hear that there's a female street gang lurking around down there called the Baby Dolls with mile long records, from grand larceny, drug dealing, assault, kidnapping, you name it. - You've been working too hard. I haven't heard anything about no Baby Dolls. That should be the least of your worries. - Who's the security team that they hired? - I assure you, they are bonded and have been investigated by my puppets, er, my employees. And they should have nothing to worry about on that evening. So if I were you, I would simply shut up, follow orders, or it may cost you your badge. Idiot. - Liars listen to lies. (light guitar music) - [Maxx] You wanna get blew away, old lady? - You ain't gonna do nothing to me! - [Maxx] Shut up! - No! Now you get up! Get up! - All right Rec Man, you, wuss. I got you next time. - Next time. What was that scripture Rev told me to read? Matthew 20? John two and 15. "And when he had made a scourge of small cords, "he drove them all out of the temple, "and the sheep, and the oxen and poured out "the changers money and overthrew the tables. "And he said unto them that sold doves, "Take these things hence; make not my Father's house "a house of merchandise. "And his disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of my house hath eaten him up." Wow. This is deep. Rev, you genius! (hip hop music) - [Man] He throat punched me. - [Man] You ain't ready. - [Man] He throat punched me. - What?! - Y'all ready to do this? - [Crew] Yeah! - I want you all to remember, our primary target is that crap man Braxton. But if anybody else gets in our way, - Yo, yo, yo, you already know! They gonna be casualties of war. (gun firing) (laughing) - Fool, give me my piece! - But I ain't got one! - Yo boss, I want that punk. Y'all give me first crack at him. I know I can take him out. - Okay Pete. But just remember, if y'all don't get the job done this time all y'all have to deal with me. You understand?! - Yeah, yeah. - What about these Baby Dolls? Billburn said they're supposed to meet us at the Center. I don't trust them or that old geezer. - Never mind them. With or without the Dolls, we can take care of Braxton. OCB? - [Crew] Out Cold Boyz in the house! - [Steel] OCB?! - [Crew] Out Cold Boyz in the house! - Let's roll out. (tense music) (car starting) (revving) (tires screeching) (revving) - All right gangsters, lock and load. - Remember, we want Braxton. And clear out everyone else. - That punk gonna be toast. He gonna be begging for the butter when we get done with him. - Shut up, imbecile. - Man, y'all gotta stop hitting me. (rock music) - You ladies ready? - Oh yeah, it's time to do this. - Oh yeah. Hey gangsters! Y'all gonna crash the party without us? - [Steel] Y'all late. OCB don't wait for nobody. - Hold up, we not late. - We are not late. We were told to get here five before eight. - Shut up, skank! If Steel say you late then you late! - [Chocolate] What did you call me?! (groaning) - All I said was what's up on the drink, dang! - Temper, temper, Chocolate. Look, don't mind him, he ignorant. Let's go. - [Maxx] Why you always getting manhandled? - Get off of me! - First the kid, now this? Don't try it.. - That kid was a karate master! - This one, brother. - Hey there's that turkey Braxton right there! Go get him! (tense music) (Whap! Whap!) (Whoosh!) (Whap!) [Gun](Click) (Whack!) (Thud!) [Pete]- Uhhhhh! - Yaahhh! - I'll get back with you. (Whap!) (Whap!) (Whap!) (Whap!) Whap!) (Ka Splat!) (Bong!) (Whup!) (Whap! Whap!) (Whack!) (Ka-Splat!) - Corey! - What are you waiting for, go get him! (tense music) - Where you think you going? Oh Yeah, (laughing) You about to get wrecked...man! (Whack!...unhhhhhh!) - Come on. - You idiots can never get nothing right! - Freeze! You're under arrest. (guns cocking) - I never trusted you hoes anyway. Hey Re Re! Go get the car and pull out where I told you to. - I got one in the chamber just for you. [Chocolate] Drop your weapons! - I got 32 in the chamber for all three of y'all. You think you can take down OCB? You all done lost your mind. (tense music) - Get back, Maxx. - [Chocolate] Ladies to the car!!! (Tires Screeching) (guns firing) (Machine gun firing) (Machine Gun Firing) (shattering) (Guns firing) (Machine Gun Firing) - [Steel] Let's get out of here, Maxx! Go, go, go, go! - So what I want you all to do is go find some help. Find the cops, somebody and get them to come back here. - Rec, I can help you man. I can get in there. - Look, you done done all you can do. If you really wanna help me, go get some help. Make sure you get somebody to attend to him and get the cops. Try to bring them back here. - These two can go. I can come with you, I can help. - You need to go. You need to go get some help, okay? Go get me some help, find some help. I gotta take care of this on my own. - Understood. - Let's go. - [Maxx] Hey yo Steel. Why did we circle around to the back of the building? - Because I saw that coward Braxton run back here. And there's only one way out, through us. (motorcycle revving) There you are, Braxton. Back in the place where we got initiated at as kids. The place where we killed your father at. - [Rec Man] Look here, Steel. Whatever happens here, this ends tonight. - Oh, oh, you're absolutely correct. Tonight it ends. It ends tonight for you. Because tonight is when you die. (Wap!) (Wap!) (Wap!) Arrrghhhhh, ohhhhhhh, Ahhhhhhhhh! (whooshing) (Whup!) Whoosh!) (Whup!) (Whoosh!) (Whup!) (Smack!!!) (grunting) I find it ironic that he's laying in the ground right where his dad was killed at. (screaming) - No! - No! - No! Get away! (guns firing) - OCB, we out! - Remember what I told you. - Tired? What you swinging at, man? - Hey, is he praying? - I think so. - Might as well pray 'cause you about to meet him. [Steel] Finish him off. Finish him off! (Action music) (Swoosh! Whack!) (Whoomph!)

Be careful, I just saved your life, punk. - [James] Yeah, yeah, whatever. - [Man] You got this handled? - Yeah, he okay. - I gotta see Detective Watts. We got another bad guy to get, Billburn. - Billburn. Let's go. (sirens blaring) (tense music) (hip hop music) (elevator beeping) - Come on! Come on! (Ding!) (guns clacking) - Lawrence Billburn, you're under arrest! - What is the meaning of this? Outrage! - You're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit mayhem. That's right, terrorist threats. - Give me this bag. - What do you have to say for yourself? [Billburn] Ummmph! - Well I had to ask. - I bet you did. Don't move. (clicking) - Hey, don't I know you? - Yeah, I'm the one who built this whole case against you. And with all of this right here, you're going away for a long time. - Aw! - Next face you see will be smiling back at you in a different way. Please, bump your head too. - Get your old behind in the car. - [Officer Cam] We finally got him. - Yup, he won't be doing no more kids wrong now. Embezzling from some the kids. - See how you enjoy your recreation now. (car starting) (Siren Beep) (tense music) (light music) So you see, although Tamika gave Billburn and the gang the Center's strengths and weaknesses, we had an undercover unit, a.k.a. the Baby Dolls tracking their every move. - So what exactly do you mean, Detective? - What I mean is this, ma'am. After Officer Debra's death it became much more clear. We knew Billburn was behind the gangs terrorizing the Center all along. His scheme was developed to help convince the public that the Center was unsafe and that it needed to be shut down. So we had the Baby Dolls infiltrate the gang and then gain the confidence of OCB and Billburn. - And then you put the whammy wham down both of them! (chuckling) - That's right, little Zeke. That's what we did. - I should fire that Tamika. - Oh give her a break, Belinda. She did try to redeem herself. - Yeah right. And Braxton, do you realize all this mess that you done caused? - The cause of all of this? - Yes you. You got the Center shot up and not to mention you done attacked some patrons. - Those patrons were a gang that tried to kill us. - Nevertheless, it was said by the Mayor himself, he is getting transferred effective immediately. I understand that you helped save the Andrew Young Center but many people don't like the ordeal that you put them through. - Put them through?! - We're facing lawsuits, attorney fees, not to mention we don't have the funding to get the Rec Center fixed. - Oh come on, Miss Rice. Let's face it. You know this is payback for exposing your boy Billburn. - [Rec Man] Really? - I don't care what the situation is. Boyz II Men, 2 Live Crew, whoever it is, they are posting bail and they are coming here. - Wow. I guess she's right. I can't stay around here and put all my friends and family's lives in danger. - Where are you transferring Rec Man to? - I don't know, Mae Jamison Center? - It isn't fair what they're doing to you, Rec Man. Wherever you'll go, - [Kids] We'll go.
