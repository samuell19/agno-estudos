Is it done? Yeah, just in time. Well done. And we've tested? I mean, it works in theory, but I'm not sure if it's gonna work in the real world with this. I mean the design may may seem a little sketchy, but it has to work fine. Not to look fine after. Good point, I suppose. The frequency acquitted universe. Just a random sentence. Let me just get out of the way. Hey, nice graphics by the way. Thanks, it's a template for a video game design. Do it. Can you hear that? It's working! Five seconds to stabilization. Three, two, one Oh, come on. What happened? It's restarting. Restarting? Yeah, the fields still growing. It doesn't make any sense. Stop it. It's not responding dad. I think we've got a mechanical problem. Mechanical. You mean, something is wrong with a machine and now we're here for more hours. Yeah, I mean, I've been checking the maths all day. Alright. It's always my fault. I guess something is wrong with the engine. Lets just unplug it, we'll start again. Yeah, we can try it. But first we have a toast with me. A toast to what dad, I mean the test failed. It doesn't matter We got the firmware but it doesn't demonstrate anything yet, but it proves that I wasn't crazy trying after all. I'm not sure how its to not being crazy. Raise your glass. This is for us. We make a great team son. Dad, is that a pig? Mamamia, get hold of it, quick. Well, this is inappropriate for a research lab. And he wonders why he doesn't get any extra funding from the university or another assistant for that matter. I swear I have nothing to do with this. Why did he follow you then? Cheecha, how did you get in here? Oh, he has a name now? Of course, he's a fancy new He's cute. Would you take it back to the padric a minute, please. That's the last thing we need around. No problem boss. Oh, you don't belong here, do you? That makes two of us. This isn't your pig, is it dad? ♪ And in our lap we had a pig ♪ ♪ Nobody knew why ♪ ♪ With a here and a there ♪ God. That scare you too? What were you doing out there dad? Never mind. Why is he still here? I don't think its Cheecha so. Looks like Cheecha to me. Maybe he has a brother who doesn't wear a collar then. A collar. Put him in here. I'm going to take care of him later. Come on. Are you worried? What if it can be fixed? If the test was wrong, it's simply wrong, And I waste my life on this. Why would you say that now? We're close, you've never questioned the theory before. Let's just switch off and we'll fix it. No actually it's better if we leave it on. Could help expose the flaw. Makes sense, what can I do to help? If you don't mind, I'd like to double check everything alone. Alone? Yeah, what's the harm? You could go to Marius and play the lotto for me, while I deal with this. Are you serious? I feel like we've got some lucky numbers. No dad, you're up to something All of a sudden you just want to check alone like you don't trust my work. Everything has always to be about you. But now you're just thinking about gambling. I don't understand you. You should be thrilled to take a break. Hang some time out over here. Catch your girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend. Whatever you call that girl. The lotto is a not gambling, the lotto is a tradition, an Italian tradition. Okay, now take it, go. Fine, I'll take it. Actually dad, if you do trust me, then surely you won't mind me taking the Vespa. Vespa, since when do you care? If you don't trust me to ride it, then fine. Of course I do, but Vespa is a collectible, a relic from the time I met your mother. and you know what I think about letting it out of the farm. Oh, well, she looks brand new. Go ahead, before I have a second thoughts. Don't drive it in the dirt. Don't leave it unattended. All right dad. Try not scratching it, go go, get out of here, go! Remember to keep to the right! Ciao boy. Oops, sorry! Ricky? Ciao. Where did you get it? Its my dad's actually. He restored it with his own two hands. I didn't know the professor had such service. Is very cute to to let you ride it. Oh, this is the first time he's ever let me touch it. He's quite precious with his possessions. That'll be him now. He's probably check to see if I crashed it or not. Dad what is it? Oh, okay. This is the lab mascot Cheecha. Oh, so cute. Dad, I'm not on my own. Sorry guys, I didn't mean to interrupt. Ciao Olivia I was just kidding around. Take care of my Vespa. Yeah, okay bye. Was it the? I don't know, even for my dad, that was quite weird. So, Olivia, do you want to maybe get some gelato later or something? Olivia. I can't leave right now. Roco needs me here. Always seem to catch you at the wrong time. Maybe later? Yeah, yeah, well I can swing by on the way home or something. Ciao. What's that? Wow, that is a coffee. Anything else I can do for you Nicki? I've always enjoyed the show. Five lucky numbers for you. I saw very funny things last night, Excuse me, I suppose picking the number out of dysmorphia. I don't know what that is. Dysmorphia, the numbers, Nicola, gracia. So, I have a drink one night, for something unusual You looked up here and find the winning numbers. If it's fate. That seems a little superstitious to my dad, no, He personally believes he wants to make the four Which stands for, the pig. That makes sense. A pig turned up at the lab yesterday. See, you must think its a sign, Then 23, the idiot. The idiot, he means me. Its the Vespa. Hey, hey! Shit. Come on. Come on. You're right Yeah, sorry, if we met before, you know my dad, I know everything about him. His story, his work, and most importantly, I know he's not crazy. Well, that's good. He's built quite a reputation around here for the opposite so. I understood your bike has been stolen. Yeah, yeah, it's a it's an old bike. It's got high sentimental value. Let me give you a ride home. I'd love learning more about your research, if you don't mind. You're not journalist are you? No I'm not a journalist. I'm Dr. Celestin Dissue. I work with the university. Ricky. I actually owe you an apology, I nearly caused you a crush earlier. The bike? That was you? Yeah. Caused me nothing but trouble since I brought it out. You're afraid your father is going to be upset, Upset, no, no, I'm afraid he's gonna be mad. I have a straightforward question, if you don't mind. Yeah, sure, I'm sorry, here its on the left Well, how can you be so sure that's such a disputed thing as the ether actually exists? If even Tesla himself couldn't suggest any possible demonstrations? I don't know. I can't speak to my father, I mean, his methods with them. I never really understood them, I wish. I don't know, maybe he's just too idealistic for me. You are saying you don't think he can make it? No, no, of course I do, I just I think, Well, I mean, it doesn't matter anyway. I'm pursuing a university career. So I'm going to have 25 years of published works and methods and projects and probably failures, but I mean, it won't matter. I'm gonna have electric chair back in London either way. I see you have it all figured out. Yeah, I've understood forward thinker. Thanks for the ride. Well, I wish you all the best luck in the world. Thanks. It was nice to meet you. Dad, you haven't fixed it yet? One should never give his time for granted. I was your age when I started this project. I was just like you, a young ambitious career scientist. I was also a dreamer, an ambition. Dad I've got something to tell you, you're probably not going to like, People admire me for my commitment, my patience... Its about the Vespa. Some years went by, and I want to publish any paper my reputation. You know, they began to wonder if I was delusional, rather than a genius. The scientific community, pushed me away, moved on, and you know where I'd be then.. Yeah left us in London and retired here. I didn't get my project done. That's what I did. never never stepped off track. Never let anybody get into major. Not even your mother. I know dad I was there. But what happened today give me a lesson. I was never in control of my future. My utopia was an easy pretext. A loop, an excuse. You get this. You lost me dad why don't we sit down. I lost you a long time ago. That's why I'm gonna do this. I hope you'll understand. You understand my my decision, my sacrifice in the future. Dad lets just calm down have a seat. Dad? Don't leave it unattended. Try not crashing it. Go Go. Get out of here, go. Remember to keep to the right! Dad? Dad. Calm down, calm down. Take a breath. You just arrived. Come here. I need to talk to you. Easy, easy. See the thing is back. You feel better, yeah. So why did you push me last night? I pushed you. Yes, you pushed me into the magnetic field and then we actually I think I blacked out but feels like it was a few minutes ago. It was few minutes ago. Dad, it was it was nighttime. Son, you there is not an easy way to say this. Please don't freak out, okay? You traveled through time. Sorry, through time What year is it dad? Its weird, everything looks like yesterday. This is not one of your pranks. It is no prank. No, I refuse to believe that this sent me into my future. In fact you didn't. This is not your future. Actually this is your past. My past. No, bullshit. What are you doing with that? Stop it you can't. This is the lab mascot Cheecha. So cute. Dad, I'm not on my own. So sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Ciao Olivia. I was just kidding around Take care of my Vespa okay. Holy shit. What the hell did you think you were doing? How, how's that possible? Do you remember receiving that video call? Yes, yes. Good. That's good. In the end, you did go see your girlfriend. Wow, five minutes ago. She's not my girlfriend. 65 minutes ago. Please tell me there's a hidden camera show I'm actually doubled. Don't be silly and don't worry, you won't be doubled for long Please, follow me here a minute. When we started the machine, it created a time loop. Then you took the Vespa out a few minutes later, which is also approximately the moment of your arrival. Did you did you see yourself riding the Vespa away when you arrived? A time machine. Yeah, now, I don't know what Dr. Rick is doing. But when he comes back seems I'll push him into the field. And he will travel 65 minutes back in time, you see, and he will become you, Ricky two. Oh, I'm Ricky two now. Only until Ricky one travels back in time and closes the loop. Then we should turn the machine off. And how do you suppose to know he's gonna do that? He will. He's not even a he, he's you one hour ago. From your perspective, this is your past. So whatever happens next to him, has already happened to you. How could you do this to me? Technically speaking, I haven't done it yet. And honestly, I'm as the clueless as you are, Not that, this all of this is? I joined your research, against everyone's advice. All of my mentors, even mom's. I was the only one who believed in you. I know that. Oh, you know that, you know that, yet behind my back, you're making a time machine and you're using test as crap as what, a cover up for me as a guinea pig. No, no, you are going too far let me explain. I don't want your explanation dad. I don't want anything from you. Come back, you can't interfere! You are not the guinea pig, Cheecha is. And you brought the message from the future. I don't know what it means. It's French I presume it's a proverb it means, time is unfaithful, for those who abuse it. You think it's like a threat? A threat? No, I don't think so. I thought you wrote it. No, me? But the calligraphy seems feminine. Must have been Dr. Dissue. Doctor Who? Your colleague from the university, the French woman. Dad how many French people do you know out here? None that I can think of. That's weird, she said you knew each other. You got to consider the trauma leg. Cheecha appeared immediately after the machine started, even before you did. So it will also travel before Because the machine only has one speed. Whatever enters in there, only jumps 65 minutes back, Well it can't have been her then. She was driving me here at the time. Well, actually not me. She was driving, Ricky one here. Shit you know what I mean, but I can't be a coincidence. This is in French though. What do you mean driving here? Why would you need a ride? You had the Vespa! Yeah, that reminds me actually. Something happened with the Vespa. Actually, no, don't worry, now I can fix it. No, whatever happened, it doesn't matter. If you break the time loop, you'll create a paradox. And I don't know, there are several scenarios. But they're just a speculation. Yes, dad its fine. I know, I'm a scientist too, as well remember. Besides I've seen every time travel movie ever made. I'm not going to stop myself going back in time. I'm just gonna, you know, get the Vespa before it gets stolen. Stolen? Don't talk to anyone! Damn it! Hey, hey! I'm literally looking at myself in the moment. I mean to be fair it's pretty interesting Dad you're talking pre-destination fate. How can you of all people believe in such things? Okay. What about things that haven't happened yet? Well, we wish people really gonna send the heat, don't you? But how much would I win if I guessed all five numbers correct? All five numbers? It's 6 million times the bet. Six million... Yeah, but never happen around here. Usually people the just two numbers. Yeah, I mean, I suppose the chances of getting five numbers out of ninety are what, 44 million to one, It must be fate. Yeah, that and probably causality. When I was a little boy, my father used to run this place I used to a farmer Old man was smoking a pipe. Sitting on a sheep, baa. The old man recomended one number to bet. Just one, Yeah, just one single number. But then, His grandpa, smoking a pipe and sheep, he had four numbers to bet. You're not going to tell me. What I mean, he won He threw a party here invite all the folks, the priest, the mayor, it was 1993. Oh my God, this was the last time, that someone score more than three numbers in this place. Over 25 years ago? Yeah. So don't believe in fate. You should talk your father into making a time machine. Yeah, might not be a bad idea? Listen, thanks, Mario. - Are you leaving? - Yeah. The draw is being released You don't want to know if you won? I don't think I've won One, two, three, four, Hey, hey! Mario, Mario, Mario, are you okay? Oh dad, what have you done? 30 million. 30? 30! 30. Woo, 30 million. Closed, come on. Ciao. Que? I lost you a long time ago that's why I'm gonna do this. I hope you will understand. You understand my decision, my sacrifice in the future, Dad let's just calm down and have a sit. I'm sorry, What are you doing here? Sorry. I had to see it with my own eyes. Your invention is out of control. You might not see it yet, but there will be consequences. Yeah I figured. Why don't you come inside, you've also got some explaining to do. Dad I'm here. I mean, yours is quite a singular time perspective. Isn't it like living your past, present and future at the same time? What, my future? A forward thinker like you hasn't considered the future? Dad she was spying. You're out of time and you can't stay here. It's dangerous. Dangerous, what are you talking about dad? Dad is that who I think? Yes, he's the man. I don't understand. He's with her. She set us up. No, no, I didn't. Are you doing all of this for the money? What money? The money of course, Lock yourself inside. I'll handle it. Ricky, shut the doors. Why am I the only one who seems to be left in the dark? That's quite the opposite. You are probably the only person who knows the whole story. Just trust me with this. Turn the machine off before the loops get concluded. No one should have a such interaction with time. Is that what you meant when you wrote this note? I know you're gonna send it with the pig. The pig. Yeah. But you didn't? What are you talking about? We were here when we received the message, which means, when I found this in your car, I must have changed time. Of course you did. Wait a second, you searched my bag? Yeah. And I found your university notes. You knew about the time machine before we did. So Excuse My French, why don't we just cut the shit, and you can tell me why we're really here. We want the same thing. I'm here to help I promise I would bet you've got to co-operate. No no, no, I don't care. What kind of deal you have my father or what he promised you. Okay, you have you're trying to frame him I read the notes delusional disorder, yeah. You're trying to discredit him just like everyone else. That's how you picture it. Yeah, that is and who's that outside anyway. Can be anyone, could even be you from what I know. Dad, is everything all right? It's cool, you brought the bike back. We forgive you. Who's there? Have you seen... Roco You need to stop doing that. Dad. Dad? Oh, no, Dad, Dad! I thought you said this is... Why did you do this? Why did you do, it, why? - Dad! - Stay back. Dad, please. He can't hear you Ricky. He can't. No that is not gonna help! You can change things if you don't go! Don't talk to anyone! So that's how you did it. You sent the numbers back with Cheecha. You need to stop being like that. You want to kill me. Quite the opposite actually. Is it gonna work? We become a rich. Well, yes, Yes. We made it, cheers! That's it. Everything is gonna work out for the best. Just answer your damn phone, Dad, it's me. Ricky? I'm literally looking at myself at the moment What? Alright Cheecha. I knew it. What a stupid prank. Why didn't you just send a note? Get changed, you stink like a Cheecha. You spoke to Mario then. Yeah, he passed out dad, I had to sneak out like a thief. I mean, what's he gonna say when he wakes up? Did you ever consider that? I asked you not to talk to anyone. Why did you travel back again? What happened to you? What happened to me, what happened to you? What happened to me? What could possibly happen to me in an hour or so? I mean, if I'm not gonna die then... Mamamia I'm gonna die. No, no, no, dad, just calm down. Okay, you're not gonna. Well you're not supposed to die yet, I mean you've got, you've got an hour. See there, you notice? See the way she's looking? She's staring like she already knows I'm gonna be there. How would she possibly know that? Pushing down the cliff, by the hand of a stranger. French. She's no stranger dad she works at the university she knows everything about you, she knows everything about the time machine. Everything? She said this guy has some sort of deal worked out. How many times, I don't know her. What about the guy from the grocery store then? Who? Walker, he's about to get out here. He's gonna knock me out. You don't think Olivia as well? Come on a conspiracy between some scientists, in that It's ridiculous. What do you suggest that it's gonna happen in an hour if we lock her up. We are obviously missing something here. Something that connects the dots and explain everything. Okay, dad, I think its time you told me the whole story, don't you? Okay, alright. Well, first of all, there is not a university. I'm not working for them. How could I? I mean, they think I'm crazy. Sorry, what? I made it up. Well, who's paying for all of this? The the equipment, the lab everything. All from my savings in and a few loans. What was I supposed to do? I was so close to complete the research. And you were involved. I couldn't turn it down. After I lost you and your mother, my research was all I got left, I think you will find it was your research that lost us in the first place dad. You're right. I'm right. Yeah. I was in a sort of loop, similar to what you were in today. I was stuck in the past. I was using it as... As an excuse. Yeah, as an excuse. Well, until one day you agreed to join the project. It was a breakthrough. You know, you following my steps. I wouldn't put it that way dad. I'm just saying it seemed perfect. My project was gonna lead you to a brilliant career and maybe fix the things between us. If the tests or didn't the truth is, I didn't know we were making a time machine, until one hour ago. Sorry, are you saying that, that is an accident. Clearly, there is no field of force, that accounts for the motion of the batteries. Tesla was wrong. Would you make any of it public? I mean, two hours after we switch this thing on, it kills you. It's too dangerous. What if this fell into the wrong hands? You can't make this public. Exactly. But no publication means also... Means no career for me. I go back to London empty handed. Not empty handed. Oh, I see. So you'll be planned to make some money out of this before you switched it off, did you? I had no time for plans? You were there too when Cheecha appeared. I only read the numbers and played along. Sorry, so you're gonna send these numbers back in time just because you received them from the future? That doesn't make any sense dad in fact, that's the paradox. Nothing is ever written. It has to start somewhere or, or some when in his case, enough, Whose idea was it to play the lotto in the first place? You shouldn't ask yourself who has decided but whose intention was it? Intention? Did you playing? Or did you just think about winning the lotto somehow? I spoke to Mario about it, but we we'd already won. We'd always we always had we'd already won. I don't know what do you think? Don't wrap your head around it. This is beyond us. There is so much we don't know about time. Now, let's send Cheecha back Dad, you really need to forget about this money. Okay, we need to switch this off before it kills you. Ricky, you surprise me, we can't. You are here only because we are not going to. At what time do I die? Seventeen past seven. If we turn it off now, instead of sending Cheecha back, there would be no Ricky one going back in time, no Ricky two. And no Ricky three. You would probably disappear or who knows? I'd rather disappear and watch you die again. Well, I appreciate your bravery but you wouldn't be here to warn me, this this conversation would never take place and we still wouldn't turn it off. The machine is meant to stay on. So what dad 'cause I don't understand. Do we just sit here and then we wait for you to be killed? Is that a plan? I just want to make sure I secure you a future. In case I don't make it after tonight. A future where are you out reign me. With a ridiculous load of money instead of I'll leave it up to you. Dad is that a pig? Grab the pig! If you don't mind, I'd like to double check everything. I feel I will get some lucky number. 30 million. 30 million. So that's how you did it. I'll leave it up to you. You're wrong about time dad, you can change the past. Just look at this message. I was meant to send it back with Cheecha numbers, but I never did. And now you can't remember. We just changed time. Oh really? What do you remember? I don't know maybe 'cause this time it was bullshit? With my timeline and your timeline, are two completely different things. I know where you are heading. Please, don't even mention parallel universes. It only makes things even more complicated than they currently are. If there's a chance that we have to try it, But... No dad just listened to me for once. Okay, so I can go back in time I can appear in the lab after Cheecha right where it all began. No, Ricky. It doesn't matter. But I know where the French woman is gonna be; I can follow her, I can talk to her, I can probably stop her. I mean, I really don't see what we have to lose with this dad, Ricky, if you calm down a second. There is one more thing that I should talk to you about. Is that you? Yeah. He can't see me. I know. You gotta go, don't take anything for granted. Dad. Good job. Would you take it back to the a minute, please, that's the last thing we need around. No problem boss. How did you do that? This isn't your pig is it dad? You made it, what have you done? You look sick. I'll be fine in a minute. This is my third time travel. Time travel? Yeah, we really screwed up. Dad, I'm sorry, we don't have time. Do not tell him about me. He's not ready. He wont understand, he'll probably try and do something stupid, okay? You discovered time travel. Don't get excited it's a bad thing. This is a reminder, to not abuse time, whatever you think you might be able to do. It won't work. Is this French? Oh, don't go play the lotto. Lotto? Lotto? That scare you too? Hey boy. Ciao. Should be more careful where you tie that horse, it could be dangerous. Ciao boy. Get off me. I hit you with my car I'm sorry. I mean a bike cut me off. You killed him. You killed my dad. Sir you hit your head, you need some time to recover. I'm fine. Sir your mind must be playing tricks. Trust me, I'm a psychologist. My name is Celestin. I know who you are, you're just after the time machine. Time machine? Yeah you work at a university now? How do you know that? Wait a second. Are you by any chance related to a certain Doctor Vinner? Come on I'm his son. What a coincidence, I'm here for an evaluation to assess his sanity with the best intention. You know they are willing to support his project if he comes to a reason. Time machine, this is turning a little different than I was expecting. I don't understand this. You came to the lab. You saw everything. May I suggest we go to the hospital? It's not uncommon after a shock to confuse suggestions and reality, please. No. Sir, please take a seat in the car. Is there any place where I can get you something to drink? This is happening in about an hour, whether you like it or not. Yeah, I mean, I thought I could change something. I'm not sure. My father seems to think that you can't change anything that's already happened. Can't argue with that. Although you said it is yet to happen, right? Like if we'd go checking we'd find him alive. I mean, it's happening to me now. Not me, that the third me, the one who traveled through time, the second time. Clear has the so he's going to die? Is that what you're saying? Yeah. And to top it all off, it's my fault. It's my intention to bag the lotto. Intentions? Yeah, so we figure down the lab, intentions is essentially what... I'm sorry but no one's future is driven by intentions. Nothing could be further from the truth. The world is full of good intentions and still. Besides, doesn't it seem strange to you that all your fears and insecurities came to life out of the blue in a couple of hours window. What do you mean? Well, your father betrays you, your girlfriend. Not my girlfriend. The girl you like, he sees the guy you actually saw. Who also takes part involving the theft of your motorbike, in order to let me, a foreign doctor who has never been to this village lure you with the purpose to get to your lab, which I already know the address. This is obviously a fantasy. You should have come to your senses guy now. I'm very concerned about your head trauma unless... Ricky, have you ever been diagnosed? Okay, look, can we just pretend for a moment, that what I'm telling you is true and that time machines exist. I'm not willing to indulge in those illusions. Perhaps just this once. What other than my intentions could possibly lead me to some happy ending other than the materialization of all of my worst nightmares at once. And partly your expectations. I wasn't expecting this. Any of it? Of course you're not. At least not consciously. Have you ever heard about self fulfilling prophecies? Look, a self fulfilling prophecy, is when a person unknowingly causes a prediction to come true, due to the simple fact that he expects it to come true. Like you expect your new roommate to be shy, so you don't speak much to him, and therefore he does seem shy. Okay, doctor I really don't see what this has to do with me. Ricky, have you ever truly believe that your father's project could succeed? Or that girl would like you back? Of course those pessimistic expectations condition the nightmare you had when you passed out. This wasn't a dream, and I really don't see how expectations could have changed anything that's already happened. Ricky, I can help you to go through this. If you just allow me. Okay, okay, you see that guy over there with a guitar. In a moment, he's going to start playing something, and when he does, I'm going to pull up over there on my bike by the tree, okay, and then another version of me, is gonna run out from behind that wall. He's gonna run straight back because he sees you. Now, if, if what I'm saying isn't true, if I'm wrong, then fine I will follow you to hospital. I like that. If what I'm telling you is right, if all this happens, then you have to promise that you will you help us stay out of the way of any version of me. Do not talk to them and also, please do not go near the latter. Where are you going? I have to go and deal with a man. Do we have a deal or not. I promise, I'll help you. Hey, hey! I'm literally looking at myself unless. You alright Yeah, sorry, have we met before, you know my dad? Ricky, you made it, come in. Where's he going? Who, my brother? Your brother? Just a few things left to sort out. And then we can go for that gelato. Is this his hat? You like it? You look cute. Olivia. You all right? Yeah. Do you ever think You know something like you You really believe is true and then you see it from someone else's point of view and it changes everything. Ricky, if there is something you are trying to say. Wow. Sorry if it came at a bad time. Que? Que? Que? I guess I just have to change my perspective. We are out of time you can stay here, it's dangerous. Dad is that who I think it is? It's the Vespa. I don't understand. He's with her, she set us up. No I'm not sure how he did it. Are you doing all this for the money? What? Money? Lock yourself inside. I'll handle it. What are you doing here? Don't tell me, always you. I figured it out, you have to die. Ricky, shut the damn door. Are you sure its gonna work? What if we make a mistake. There are countless variables. This has already happened. He's gonna see us, just snap Have you seen... I'm sorry. Roco. It's all right, he knows what he's doing What's going on here? How many copies are there? We we haven't been introduced properly. Thanks for your help. My help? Didn't think you were coming. Well, I promised I was gonna help. Your place to be quite important actually. My place? Oh, you haven't explained anything yet? No. Go grab this thing, follow me I'll explain. I am not doing it. You have to, we need to to move forward, Dad, just... Dr. Celestine, please remember to scream, good luck. Dad, Dad! It's you, you set this in motion! - Dad! - Why did you do this, why? Okay, last time I save your life How can you not see that? It's quite dark. You do look a bit similar. - She's good. - Yeah. No, that is not gonna help! You can change things if you don't go! Can someone please explain what's going on? Is this insanity ever going to stop? Just come in, doctor, it's over. Actions, reactions, consequences, all mixed up. We still can't account for the paradox though. Ricky has his own theory about it, but I don't know. I presume we just demonstrated the existence of a fate. Fate was a nice idea, but it has nothing to do with physics. It is determined by your actions, by who you are. And you don't need a time machine to determine yours. I'm afraid these are all consequences of my actions actually. I mean, I came up with a formula, I turn the machine on, I convince you to play the lotto. I drag you into this, stole the Vespa for myself, I kissed Olivia. You what? My whole life I thought I was just reacting to things. And never I realized I actually made things happen. I was wrong, you two were right, I should have stopped. Larking around in the past, should have concentrate on my future. But in the end, you achieve something even harder than that. You change your mind about it and focus on your future rather than your past. I'm sorry. I'm proud with you, son. You have nothing to apologize for. The machine is such a big deal. I wouldn't trust anybody else to use it. Imagine how things could have turned out, if you weren't here. I guess one crazy scientist is enough for this family, eh? I'm sorry to interrupt the family moment but. We need to turn it off! I'm glad to see you two finally agree on something. You got it? Yeah, can you check the display for us? Okay, what am I looking at? Just wait for the bar to hit stable. Okay, device progressing. Now! Dad? Professor Reid, where is the switch? Everybody stay still. We forgot Mario. It's here, give me a second. Wait. Who is that talking? Oh, f...
