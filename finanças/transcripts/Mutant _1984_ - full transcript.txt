- I'm lost. Josh, where are we man? Josh, Josh where in the hell are we? Look man we're not even on the map anymore-- - Mike, wait, wait, wait, wait, just relax all right? Relax. We're out in the country for God's sake huh? I drug you out of the city to get you away from all this crap now I just want you to relax, forget everything, all your problems, your troubles. Especially that beautiful little girl who dumped you I'm so sorry about that. - Oh come on that is not even the point, that's not what I'm talking about. She didn't dump me all right? We just have irreconcilable differences. - That's a good word. - Josh would you please keep your eyes on the road? Okay, you're making me nervous. - I could drive this kind of road blindfolded. - Well please don't prove it okay? - My eyes are closing. Oh no. I'm losing control. - Josh come on, please Josh, come on Josh. - Floating down stream - Look watch where you're going. Come on you're on the wrong side of the road. Josh you're gonna get us killed! Fishing pole. - Would you watch out! Whoa! - You just nearly got us killed! What did I tell you! You're getting off on that, you think that's funny. - Well that's exciting. - I can't believe this, you bring me to the country so I can relax, now I'm getting an ulcer. - You know Mike I really want you to lighten up. You understand? I mean a good jolt like that is good for your circulation. I got this doctor friend right? He told me an encounter with death is like an encounter with life. Pretty exciting guy. - I can't believe-- What the hell was that? Hey city boy! - What the hell's he doing man? - Get that piece of junk off the road boy! What's with that crazy jerk! - I'll give you a little help! I'll give you a little push! - Josh will you just let 'em pass! Josh those guys are crazy! Hey get that car off our road! - What the hell are you doing? - We're gonna teach you city boys how to drive! - You wanna play? Come on! - Yeah you hog jawed city slicker! Get 'em baby! Get 'em! Trying to kill us! Damn redneck! - Josh, Josh, look out! Man we're gonna crash! Watch out! Oh man. - Looks like you boys, caught between a rock and a wet place. - Hey Josh come on. Josh there's too many-- - Why don't you just get down here and drown yourself. - Throw 'em a life preserver Billy Bob. - You, come on down here huh? - Happy trails punks. - So long suckers. Smooth sailing. - I hate to say I told you so man. Great vacation Josh. All right big shot let's see you walk with your eyes closed. - Look will you listen? There's gonna be a town up ahead. In this town there's gonna be a gas station, gas station's gonna be a tow truck, we're gonna be fine. - Wait a minute I hear a car. I'll get this guy to help us. - Sure you will. Ever body's so accommodating out here in the country. I'd say he's probably in a hurry to help somebody huh Mike? Come on. Oh yeah this is perfect. Now this is what's known as southern hospitality at it's finest. Let me stop this one, you just sit it out. Been nice knowing ya. Son of a! - God Josh are you okay? What is this guy doing? Now Josh cool it. Cool it! What are you out of your mind? - Sorry. Didn't see ya. - Oh you didn't see me. - You all all right? - Yeah, yeah I'm fine. - Well that's good. Is that your little ole car back down there in the water down the road? - Yeah. Unfortunately we ran into some of you local heroes here. - You know where there's a gas station? - Yeah there's one in Goodland. Course it's two or three miles from here, tell ya, hop in and I'll take ya to it. My name's Mel. - Mel. Come on. - You wanna go with him? - Don't wanna walk. - Then you sit next to him all right? I ain't touching him. - So you hunt Mel? - Hunt? Yeah I guess I do. - Well what is it that you hunt Mel? - Anything that's running away. Come to think of it I did a little huntin' just the other day, guess what we was looking for? - Gerbils? - No, no I think old Mel is into city boys right? - Little green men. Oh right, the martians. - Yeah or some kind of perverts, we ain't quite sure which it is yet. Course if you ain't careful now you boys might just find out what it is. Last visitors come through here, they's nice folks, they just up and disappeared. - Disappeared? If I was you I'd be going the other way just as fast as possible. - Well we plan to. - Oh yeah, yeah. - So how much further is this town anyway? - I'm sorry boys, I'm sorry, would you mind if I let y'all off up here at the fork? I'm running more behind than I thought I was. It'll be all right, you'll be fine long as you keep moving. And Goodland's right on up the road there. Can't miss it just about a mile. - Okay. Thanks again Mel. - And boy, if I was you I'd shake a leg. Ain't good to be out on these roads after dark. - Okay, thanks again Mel. - Hey, hey Mel. Listen we're gonna keep a real good watch out for all the perverts and martians all right? - You do that city boy. - Josh. - Yeah? - Maybe we outta just head back to the car. - What's the matter son? Ain't you never been shot before? Come on Mike this guy's laughing his face all the way to Toledo all right? Come on. We'll get some burgers, we'll get some beer, we'll dance. Find some lonely lonely little lady. - Yeah it's the Capital City kids passing through. No problem. I'm coming on in. A mile the man says. Country mile. Yeah, well at least it's civilization man. Barely. Looks like a one horse town to me. You sure about that? Looks like a half horse to me. Well don't knock it, look they got a bar. All right. Jack's Tavern. Look at this guy. Hello! Hey Mister! - Excuse me, we're lost we need some... Town drunk. Perfect huh? - Josh man I don't even think this place has a gas station. - No but Mike, it's got a bar. You know what I mean? Let's drink. - Wait a minute Josh. Did you hear that man? I heard something. - What? - I don't know. - Mike, no mike we're getting... Look it's probably one of Mel's little green perverts. Mike will you come back here? Look I'll buy the drinks all right? Mike! Mike come on, what are you doing? Let's get out of here. - Would you just wait a minute man? I really heard something back here. - Well it's probably a cat, now come on let's get out of here. Mike you okay? Mike? - Is he dead? I'll go get the police. - Mike. - You watch this nine ball disappear. - Hi. - Can I help you son? - I need a police department, do you have a police department in the town or something? - What's your problem? - Well look I just need to talk to the sheriff okay? - Hey looky there. - Let's have some fun boys. Excuse me boy. Don't I know you from somewhere? Oh yeah, you's one of them little boys out by the highway. Well you put a scratch in my front bumper. - Okay Albert. Back off. - Stay out of this Jack. Damn near ruined a good pickup with that crazy driving of yours. Didn't he baby? - That's right honey, he's the one. - Excuse me, this is my brother. We don't want any trouble all right? We just wanna make a phone call and get out of town, all right? - Well you boys just think you can come in our little town and act any way you damn well please don't ya? You got no respect for property. You break all our laws, and you hightail it back to your fancy little condominiums. It's about time you was taught a lesson. - Wait a minute, you're the bastard that started this whole thing. - Will you shut your mouth Mike? - Yeah. I'm the bastard that's gonna finish it too. Take him! Okay pretty boy. You gonna eat some steel. - Mike! Shouldn't've done that little boy. - Come on! Come on! - Albert! You gonna eat some glass. - Drop it Albert. Drop it! I don't hear anything hitting the floor. You know Albert I am sick and tired of this kind of crap from you, you got me? All right folks that's it for the night. Have you a drink Sheriff. - That's right Sheriff. Suck that stuff down. Suck it down so you can forget. How you screwed up in the big city. But I ain't gonna forget you two little boys. Albert's gonna get you. - Albert I told you to go on home. Don't push it. - You got something for this? - Yeah sure son. Use this. - Excuse me Sheriff but we got a bleeding man, is there a doctor in this town? Mm hmm. - Well would it be too much to ask for you to drive him to the doctor? - Now wait a minute, wait a minute, look Sheriff there's a dead man outside, I think he's been murdered. - Nice going. - Hey! Will. - That's not him. - What are you doing here? - Sorry to interrupt your beauty sleep Harve, but you better get up and go on home now. - I thought I was home, that's funny. Nice to meet you. This way Harve. Nice to meet you too. - Anything else? - Sheriff that is not the same guy that was there. - Now Mike, knock it off. Look he's not about to believe you all right. - Damn right. I got enough problems around here without you people. Now I don't know why you're here and I don't care. Now I'm taking you to get your arm fixed, but I want you people to leave first thing tomorrow. You got me? - Yeah, yeah I got you. Best advice I heard all day. Thanks a lot Sheriff. Let's go Mike. Mike? Sheriff I-- Let's go boy. - Well I think you're gonna live. Okay you can put your shirt on now. Do you have a place to stay tonight? - Well actually the Sheriff here seems to think we should get on out of town. - Oh, why don't you just wait in the waiting room for a second with your brother? Okay? - Okay. - Thanks a lot Doctor. Thanks Sheriff. - Will that boy shouldn't travel tonight. Why don't you do me a favor and just put 'em up at Misses Mapes, huh? - Okay. Myra. - Sheriff. - Well I hate to bother you, but I was wondering if I might ask you a favor. - I know you don't like to ask favors, maybe if you were off the juice you wouldn't have to. - Not the kind of favor I'm talking about. Besides, what's between us was over three months ago. I don't compete with college kids. - I can't believe you're jealous of my hired help. - You gotta admit, you and him here, alone at night, and you know how people think. - The only reason we're alone is because people don't wanna come to a small town old fashioned doctor who also just happens to be a woman. Even my regulars are canceling. I don't know what it is. Is it me? - No, no. You're still the same wonderful, beautiful person. Even if you are a woman. - How can I help you Sheriff? - Well, it's something I found. I was wondering if you might check it out, tell me what it is, where it came from? Ow, damn it's hot! What the hell is it? I don't think she's home. Helen is always home. - Mike. Here let me, let me help you there Sheriff. - And first thing tomorrow morning, I want you to go down to Royant's gas station at the edge of town, get your car fixed and on the road you got me? - Yeah. Yes sir. - Thanks. - Oh by the way, now Misses Mapes may not have the best accommodations in the world but she loves company so she'll probably give you boys a big breakfast. - Great. Thanks a lot. Mm hmm. Sheriff. - Yeah? - You gotta believe me, that was not the same man, the man I saw was dead. - Do you have wax in your ears? I told you to drop it or do you wanna come down, spend the night with me because I don't have no breakfast down there at that jail boy. Dropping it Sheriff. Goodnight. What the hell are you doing huh? You just don't know when to keep that mouth shut do you? Real cheerful place. - I don't think anybody's here. - Looks like we're on the lawn guy. - Yes? What can I do for you gentlemen? - Look we're sorry to bust in so late, but the Sheriff said you might have a room to rent? - Sheriff Stewart? - Yeah, he just dropped us off. - Oh I see. - Misses Mapes right? - Yes. - I'm Josh, and this is my brother Mike. - Hi. - Our car broke down and we just need a place to stay. We'll be gone first thing in the morning I promise. - Well, don't just stand out there talking, why don't you come on in and make yourselves at home. - Thank you. - Well I haven't taken in anybody in quite a spell now. Ever since my daughter died. Sorry to hear that Misses Mapes. - Well that's all right it's been a long time ago. I still change the sheets right regular though. Habit I guess. - Oh yes, the bed. Well since there's only one bed, the floor is yours. - I thought I could give you two rooms. The price would be the same. - Well thank you, that's very nice of you. How much do we owe you? - Just $15 and you can pay it when you leave. Who knows you might stay longer than you'd planned. Now the other room is down the hall, who's coming with me? - He is. - Me. Thanks. - You know she's just your type. Have fun, close the door, thank you, goodnight, God bless. - Goodnight. - There we are. - Quite a difference in rooms isn't there? - Well a growing boy like you needs to have a nice big bed. Now if you need anything I'll be up. Down in the living room. - No I'm sure I'll be fine Misses Mapes, thank you. - You have a good night's sleep. - All righty, thanks. - Didn't I give you till sundown to get out of town boy? - It's not funny Josh, it's the second time tonight. Second time huh? - You're gonna give me a heart attack. - Now this is nice. This is all right, how do you rate this? I got Posturepedic concrete. - Josh. Look man you know that was not the same body we saw! - Mike, I don't care. Look, I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna have this car fixed in the morning, and then you and I are gonna get the hell outta town. - We're just gonna close our eyes and forget the whole thing, is that it? - Basically yes. - You know it's just not-- - What, what, what? It's not right? Are you gonna tell me it's not right, then you tell me it's not right that somebody sticks a broken beer bottle in my face. That's right? Huh? Look I'm outta this town. That's it. Gone. - Man you know I cannot believe you, you are so selfish! Look, if you're not gonna do anything about this I am. - No, no you're not gonna do a damn thing, you're gonna listen to me. Mike. I'll make a deal with you. We at least get the car fixed, and we get across the county line before we call the cops, we can do anything after that. Okay Mister Humanity? - Okay that sounds good, but I want you to promise me okay, when we get outta town we do that. All right? - I'm promising, all right? Do I lie to you? - Yes, just shake, I want your word. Please? - I want you to lighten up, huh? I shake, deal. Now you-- Ah Josh, my arm man! - I'm sorry, just get some sleep, and don't leave the room, you understand? - Josh. What? - I love you man, you know that. - I think that's the first time I've ever heard you say that. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - You can get this prescription filled in the morning when the drug store opens, in the meantime, give your husband these pills. They'll take care of his cough and so you can get some sleep. - Thank you Doctor Tate. - Dorothy, you really should advise your husband to come in, I should take a look at Mister Miller myself. - Well you do know that the company pays the health plan over at the new medical center. - Yes I know. I understand. Night. - Goodbye. - Strange, I haven't seen Misses Miller since the new medical center opened. - I know it is strange. And also she's the 5th one of my old patients to come in today. - Oh by the way Doctor Tate, I've noticed inventory's low but I'm not sure if I should order anything. With all the cancellations we've had we look wide open. - I know Vic, probably right, but I think something's going around. I mean did you notice how empty the streets were today? So let's be prepared. - Okay. - Josh? Josh is that you? - Yo Mike. Let's get outta here. Oh, excuse me. - Oh, well. It's about time you got up, it's almost noon. I thought you gonna sleep all day. - Misses Mapes, have you seen my brother? - No I haven't. He didn't answer when I knocked, but he left his things here. Guess maybe you fellas'll be staying on another night. - No, no. Listen if you see him will you tell him I'll be back, okay? - Certainly. Thank you. Hello? Finally, a spokesman for New Era Industries stated just after the bidding that they're optimistic they'll win the contract. Sports and weather in 30 minutes but now here's-- - Hello? With more music. - Anybody here? Hello? You open? Yeah, we're open. - Oh, excuse me, wasn't sure, it seems like everything in town is closed today. Can I get you something? - Nah I don't think so. Ah well, yeah, I'm looking for my brother. He's about 20 years old, brown hair. He's cute. - You're the first person that's been in here all day. - Well he probably went to the gas station to get a tow truck, our cars in the ditch outside of town. - Oh that's not so, the gas station's been closed all week. Lou's sick. - Lou's sick. All right, thank you. - Oh but there's another gas station on the outskirts of town. It's probably open. - Well thank you. - About four or five miles. - Four or five miles, I see. Well is there a bus? Cab? Any kind of public transportation in this town? - You're not from around here are you? - No. Can I get a beer? - Okay. - Thanks. - Listen, the gas station's not far from where I teach, I'm gonna go pick up some papers so if you want you can come along. - So you're a teacher and you tend bar, this is a small town. - I do teach. All the kids are out with a bug. There's a flu going around. My uncle Jack who runs this place is out with it too. I must look a mess. - No, you look fine. Actually you look sensational. Look, my name's Josh. - Holly. - Holly? I sure would appreciate a ride to that gas station. - Sure. What is that concoction? - A little sodium bisulfate. - Don't give me any of that technical garbage Myra just tell me what it is. - Okay. Drink it. - What? - It's my father's famous hangover antidote. When he was GP 30 years ago. - Uh huh, and he used to give his patients this stuff to drink? - His patients hell it was for Dad. After he came back from having a binge. I suggest you drink it up, so we can get down to work. Last night I ran some tests on that sample you gave me, and you're not gonna believe this. It's blood. - Human blood? - Well yes and no, I mean it does have two out of three main components of blood, plasma and white cells, there was no red cells. And then there's some other substance giving it that yellowish color. What is it? - You got me. There's one thing I know for sure though, nothing human could have this in it's veins and live. - So where did it come from? Is it some sort of disease? - No I don't think so. And there's another thing Will. Very peculiar. I accidentally spilled some of it on the blood on that boy's handkerchief, well it absorbed it and grew. I mean it must've increased in mass almost three times it's size. - Myra I want you to get this over to the county medical center right now. You wait here. See anyone? - Well, whatever it was got away. Anything missing? - Who would wanna steal blood? And you ended up in Goodland on your vacation? I don't believe it. - Well I guess you call it fate. So anyhow I was just, I don't know going out of my mind looking at so many race car designs I thought it was time to take a little R and R. - Well you might get some rest in Goodland but I don't know about the recreation. It's right this way. I'm just gonna be a minute. I'm just gonna pick up some... Billy? Billy what are you doing here? - I got to school late and nobody was here. - School's canceled today Billy. You can go home. - I can't Miss Pierce, nobody's at home. My mom and dad are gone. They left me for good. - Aw. Billy, they probably just went out shopping, they'll be back. Listen to me Billy, listen, I bet your mom and dad are waiting out for you right now. It's okay. Come on, let's go. Okay, bye Miss Pierce. Goodbye. - See you. Bye. - He's great. - Listen, I gotta find my brother, can we get going? Sure. - The hell was that? - The only person that should be in here is the janitor. - Listen. This way. Sounds like it's coming from down there. - The boiler room. - Hello? No no, wait, wait, wait. - Why? Because I'm a woman? - Just wait, all right? You'll be fine, just relax. - Well well well, looky what we got here. - Get the Sheriff. - What you doing down here city boy? I said get the Sheriff, look at this girl! - Oh what have you done to that precious little baby? - What are you talking about what I've done? Now you know I didn't-- - Didn't? Didn't what? You reckon anybody around here's gonna believe you city boy? Come on. - That is if you're able to talk. - Now look, come on. - You know what we do to child killers around here? - I'm proud of Albert, stopping child killer. Come on, come on! - All right Albert let's go over this one more time. - I've been trying to tell you Sheriff, I don't know how he killed that little gal. I just know he killed her and then he turned on me. - And that's exactly what happened? - What are you giving me such a hard time for? I damn near got blinded trying to stop him! - That's a lie! Sheriff you can't believe that, he was with me. You were nowhere near there baby. - Oh yeah? - Yeah! - All right, all right! Knock it off the both of ya. Now I want full statements later. Will you fix his face. - Sheriff, I'm sure he didn't do it. I'm sure. - Well I already heard you Holly, but if he's so innocent why did he run away? - Maybe because he was scared. - Yeah well maybe when I find him we'll get some answers then won't we? Meantime there's nothing for you to be doing around here, why don't you go on home, I got enough problems. Stewart. - This is Stewart. - Stewart, this is Dawson, that's a negative on that backup. You're on your own now. - Captain I've got a homicide here. There must be somebody you can send out. - I hear you Will, I'm leaving now for Route 14 myself. I got a tanker truck overturned and 15 cars on fire. I got a 2-11 over on Carlsburg, now I'm just short handed. - I need help now! - And I'm telling you you're gonna have to wait Stewart. Look, just get that body over to the coroner's right now. Out. - Thank you, put her over there. Will? Come see this. Couldn't have been the boy. Nothing human could've done this. Look at this. - Damn. - That's the same substance you gave me to analyze. All right I wanna get this body over to the coroner right away. - Sheriff, Sheriff, how about a statement? - Will! I want to examine that body. - No. - Will you know something's going on around here. I mean look around you, the town's almost empty. I mean it must have something to do with that girl. - I said no Myra look, I got my job to do and you got your job to do. - All I want is one night with the body. Just one night, I mean then I can analyze that chemical, compare it to the specimen you gave me, just one night, please? - Boy I've never met a more hard headed damn woman in my life. I told you no I got orders! - Dammit Will, why don't you go out on a limb for once in your life! - I've been out on a limb, you of all people oughta know that. All right, you got one night, but first thing tomorrow morning, I want you to get that body to the coroner, now you got me? - Thank you Sheriff. There might be some hope for you after all. - I doubt it. - Do the girl's parents know yet? - No. I'm on my way over there right now. I don't know what the hell I'm gonna tell 'em, do you? I'll see you later. - Holly? Look I'm sorry, I didn't think it was safe yet. - You scared me! What happened back there with you and Albert? Are you okay? - Yeah I'm fine, look all we gotta do is get to your house all right? Just drive, we'll talk then. - Okay. - Mister Mitchell? Misses Mitchell? Ow, son of a... My God. Mister Mitchell what happened? - The hands, it's the... The hands... This is Stewart. Go ahead. - Captain, you better get your... You better get down here and see this, I've got another homicide. - Stewart what in the hell's going on over there? - I wish I knew, but if I was deputy chief of this county I'd wanna see this firsthand. - I'll be there just as soon as I can, and look, don't you touch anything, not until I get there. - But you gotta eat something Uncle Jack, or you'll never get better. - No Holly, a good night's sleep and I'll be as good as gold. - But you might get worse. - Please, let me be. Turn out the light honey, it hurts my eyes. - Okay. - I love you. - I love you Uncle Jack. Goodnight. - Goodnight baby. - Maybe I can help you find what you're looking for. - Look I'm gonna borrow your car, and I'm gonna go look for my brother, all right? - I don't think so. I don't think you're going anywhere. The sheriff's out looking for you, he thinks you did it. - How does he think I could possibly do something like that? - He's got a witness, Albert Hogue. - Albert Hogue? That man is a caveman, you know what I'm saying? Not gonna believe him. - Okay well that caveman was the only one with you. You made me wait upstairs remember? - What is with you people here huh? What are you a bunch of rednecks, you got nothing else better to do than to pick on outsiders like us? Is that it? I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry. Holly it's not you it's... Listen, I'm scared. I'm really scared. - I'm scared too. Tracey Mitchell was a beautiful girl. Every Monday morning she'd put a rose on my desk when she thought I wasn't looking. And now she's dead. Josh, what did that to her? - I don't know. I don't know but, I got this feeling that my little brother's messed up in it, and I'm responsible for him being here. You understand? - Yeah. - He's your younger brother but he's a grown man. He can take care of himself. - I don't know this was gonna be like the first time in eight years we were gonna have a chance just to be alone. Hang out with each other, and now I can't find him so... - Right now he's probably looking for you. - You're probably right. You know you're pretty. No you're pretty. Come here. Thanks Holly. - Josh. What's the matter? Josh what's the matter? What's the matter? Uncle Jack! Easy, easy Josh take it easy. - Where am I? - You've been unconscious for awhile. Hi. - Hi. What happened? - When you found that girl did you touch her? - Yeah. - Careful. - She fell, she fell right on me. - Uh huh. 'Cause from the symptoms you seem to have had a toxic chemical reaction. - Chemical reaction, wait a second, how can I get a chemical reaction from a little girl? - I don't know, but I'm sure you'll be all right in the morning. - Holly, has Mike showed up? - No, not yet. - I gotta get out of here, I gotta find him. - Listen, you're not gonna be able to look for him tonight because I gave you a shot and you're just gonna have to rest. - I'll take him back to my place Doctor Tate. If there're any problems we'll give you a call. - Don't know how to thank you, okay? Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Tom that you? - Yeah. No power? - It won't work Captain. Every light bulb in the house is missing. The body's missing. - The body is missing? - Now, he was right here. - I guess he just, got up and walked out. - What do you think? You think I just brought you out here for the hell of it? Is that what you think? - You know I used to think I'd know you better than this, but you wanna know what I really think? I think you're a washed up big city cop who's hiding in a bottle. - Let me tell you something Tom, I got a dead child over at Myra's right now, and I'm telling ya-- - Wait a minute, wait a minute, that body's at Myra Tate's? What happened to the coroner? - Myra's gonna send it over in the morning. - Well you don't make those decisions I do, and I told you to send that body today, and what is it at Myra Tate's for anyway? She's just a GP not a pathologist. - She might be a GP but she knows enough. - Yeah, just like you huh? You know I'm sick and tired of your fairy tales. Now you got until 10 tomorrow morning to come up with some answers, and if you can't I'm having you suspended. - Well then you better suspend me because I'm telling you there's something going on here. - You know Stewart, this job was a handout to you anyway. Everybody felt sorry for you. Everyone knows why you don't like wearing that gun. You was probably dead drunk when you shot that kid. I think this belongs to you. - Tracey Mitchell was not murdered. The chemical compound I found in her bloodstream was unlike any other I've ever seen. It contained large traces of zinc chloride. No human being could have that caustic substance in it's veins without eating away it's own flesh. I can only assume that some sort of mutation has occurred. It allows the body to withstand the shock of this toxic fluid. Much like a snake is immune to it's own venom. - Doctor Tate, feels like I'm coming down with that flu. Do you have something I can take? - Just a second Vic, I'll be right with ya. Just wanna finish this up. I think, and this is a guess here, that this chemical would cause complete breakdown of the nervous system. It expands rapidly when mixed with blood, growing in volume many times, and since the vessel walls are thinnest in the extremities, the hands of this poor creature, would burst open because the body part could not withstand the pressure. I called her a creature just now, because there's no way in heaven that she could still be human. This mutation somehow causes an increasing need for blood. How it is ingested from the organisms still baffles me. I can only assume that it has something to do with the openings in the hands. They resemble the orifices used by leeches in sucking blood from their host's body. There's no telling how far this has spread. God help us if there are any more of these creatures. Vic, come and take a look at this. Oh, no! Vic, no! - Okay, now you know he hasn't been here. Now what? - Now what? I'll tell you what. Ever since I arrived in this damn town it's been nothing but insanity. I got rednecks trying to kill me, a dead little girl falls on me, and the doctor tells me I got a chemical reaction. - But what are you getting at? Josh? - Wait a second. There's a chemical plant here isn't there? - No. Not that I know of. - No no, think about it. - There is New Era. It's this big conglomerate, they're supposed to reactivate the old mines. I hear they're into oil, coal. - Chemicals? - Yes. - You know where it is? - Sure, yes. This is where the property starts, right here. All right how are we gonna get in here? I hear they shoot first and ask questions later. - Listen, first of all, we are not gonna go in there, second of all not because you're a woman, all right? But if I get spotted I can run a lot faster. No listen, Holly, just give me 15 minutes. 15 minutes I'll be right back. Josh. - What? You got just 15 minutes. - Don't worry, all right? Hey Sam! Come on down I got another load. Wait a second. You two come here. Take that lid off over there. Get the hose on. Put it all in. Turn it on. Jim, Art, y'all come on over here. Hey, what's that over there? One move and it'll be your last. - Turn over. Hi, my name's Mel. 'Member me? - You know this stuff you're taking out of here is killing people Mel? - Kid this isn't stuff, this is chemical waste. Now you got it all wrong. We ain't takin' anything outta here, that'd be stealing from Mother Nature. We're puttin' it back in. Now why don't you just lean over there and see for your own self. How deep is it Jim? I don't rightly know Mister Stacker. Some of these cells run on for miles. Why don't you hop on in there boy and find out? Stop him! Come on boy, make me use it. - You listen to me it's not gonna work you understand? There are people who know where I am. - There ain't gonna be nothing left of you for them to find. - Josh! Josh! - Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Oh it's about time you showed up. Okay look we got all the evidence we need, all we gotta do is get to the Sheriff's all right? Oh I love you, I love you girl! Drive past the station and just pull over all right? Look, I'll go tell him everything we know about New Era. The only problem is he might be in cahoots with 'em and if he is there's no telling what he's gonna do. - Sheriff Stewart? No, he's not-- - Now listen, listen Holly, I don't know what to think about your Sheriff, or your little town anymore. Look, what I want you to do is you go home, get your uncle, if I'm not back right away, then you just get the hell out of town as fast as you can. Find the state police and tell 'em what happened, all right? - Okay. Look, I-- - Josh-- - No, no. Don't worry, okay? - Okay. - Sheriff, listen before you say anything at all you gotta hear me out, all right? I know what's going on. I know what killed that little girl. - Well congratulations. I believe you, but as of this morning I'm no longer Sheriff. I've been promoted to civilian. - Didn't you hear what I said? I know why people are dying, I got proof! - So do I. 86 proof. - Uncle Jack? Uncle Jack? Uncle Jack? Who was here? Are you all right? Let me take a look at you. I just wanna help you. If Holly verifies your story I'll go to New Era. - No, no, uncle Jack, please! No, no, please, please Uncle Jack! Watch it! - Look Maurice that's right, I understand about the suspension but this is a... This is an... Look dammit you tell Dawson to get in touch with me and you better... Even the secretary hangs up on me. - Look Sheriff, this whole town could be affected. I mean we might be the only three people left. - What are we gonna do? - Well whatever we do we better do it before nightfall. Seems the light hurts their eyes. - All right. Can't serve that suspension on me, until they see me. So, we'll go by Myra's, pick up the body, and I'll personally dump it in Dawson's lap. Let's go. - No, no you go. I still gotta find my brother. - When's the last time you seen him? - I haven't seen him since the night you dropped us off at Mapes house. I went by there this morning before we went to New Era, he wasn't there, and the old lady was gone too. - The old lady was gone? Did you talk to her daughter? - Whose daughter? - Misses Mapes' daughter Penelope. - She told me that she lived alone, and that her daughter was dead. - I don't like it. You go on by there, we'll go by Myra's and meet you halfway, at the school. - You okay? - Yeah. - All right, come on. - Myra? Myra! There's no telling how far this has spread. God help us if there are anymore of these creatures. Vic, come and take a look at this. - Come on, move move! Get out of here honey! - Where is he? Why whatever are you talking about? - I'm talking about my brother! Now what have you and your daughter done with him huh? - I told you my daughter was dead! - Yeah well you lied lady! - You get outta-- - Mike? - Get outta here! I'm gonna call the police! - Call the police, Mike! Mike! - You got no right! You got no right to be in here! Get outta here! - Mike! Mike. Mike! Mike. No, no! I'm so sorry. No! No! Get back! Get away from me! No Penny, no, I'm your mother Penny! No, no please no! Billy! It's Miss Pierce! No, go away! - It's all right Billy it's me! Come back Billy! Billy! Billy! Billy? Billy? Billy?

So it doesn't fall out. - Okay. Josh it's no use. We're not gonna make it. - Now you listen to me, don't you dare start talking like that! We're gonna get outta here you understand me? We're gonna get out! Holly. Holly. Look, after all these years we've known each other would I ever lie? Okay? Okay? - Okay. - Come on. - Okay. Josh? - What? - What happened to Will? - I don't know, I don't think he made it. - Was Mike at Mapes? - Mike didn't make it either. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. I'm so sorry. So sorry. - Come on, come on. Not now, not now. - Josh I don't understand it. Why are some people affected by it and others aren't? - I don't know. I guess because others are more susceptible. I tell you Holly sooner or later, this poison's gonna affect everybody. - No, no. - Holly. - No. - Holly, no no, stay with me, don't break. Please don't break now. Holly, come on look, all we gotta do, all we gotta do is get through the night, all right? We're gonna get out of here Holly. Okay? Come on, please. Now listen to me, listen, listen. We need some more bottles all right? Go back in the garage and get some more bottles. Please? Here. Holly! Be quiet! - Well well well, imagine that. Big old Albert hiding in that closet. Thinking it's one of them things running around out here. - Oh Albert. Thank God it's only you. - Oh yeah thank God it's only me. You're not gonna be quite so happy when you hear what I got in mind for you darlin'. - What are you talking about? - I'm gonna use you like bait on a hook. By the time them things are through feastin' on you, Albert's gonna be in the next county. Come on. Come on darlin'. No! Come on! Come on Albert, give me a reason! Move come on! - I was kidding, I was just kidding! Come on Albert! He isn't worth it Josh! Josh! - Hey man, don't do that, I's just kidding. Josh, please? - All right Albert. Get the rope, get the rope move, get up! Get on your feet Albert! Get up! Come on turn around! Hey man. - Put your hands behind your back! You tie him up real tight. - Uh uh, uh uh. You shoot, and you'll kill this little gal. You make another move! I will snap her neck, like a matchstick. - All right, all right Albert. Now you listen to me, you can't go out there you understand? Don't go out there. - Oh no? Uh uh, we're back to the bait deal again. This little lady? She's my ticket out of here. - Holly! Holly, collect the bottles. Oh God not me! - Here. Get down, get down! Hold your fire! Stand clear! Stand clear! All right, let's move in. Careful now. The town is a disaster. Hey Captain! Captain! Can you tell em the extent of the damage? It's hard to tell. You two okay? - My God man I thought you were dead. So did I. What finally got him out here? Well I went over Dawson's head straight to the governor's office, and some of those New Era workers were brought in with chemical burns. We got 'em to admit everything. Even an EPA investigator disappeared. We found him in Misses Mapes cellar. Stewart, Stewart. About that suspension. I guess it's no longer in the works. Well that's mighty nice of you Captain. Oh by the way, I think you know where you can put this. You all right? - Yeah. - And here's an update on that strange business we earlier reported-- You want a drink? I'd love a drink. Something other than a natural catastrophe. 29 people have already been confirmed dead, and speculation is that the body count will be considerably higher. Stay tuned to WELM for more details.
