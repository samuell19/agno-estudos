Yes. sir. first thing in the morning. That was Thorn. He's a damn good cop. Appreciate the difficulty. Ed. But the department wants to cooperate with the governor's office. right? Whatever you say. sir. WOMAN 1: It looks like a fair-complected man... ...maybe someone close to you. a protector.

Where did you go with Simonson? No place. Shopping once in a while. -Except-- -Except? He took me to church. Church? What did he do there? He prayed. And he talked to a priest. That's about all. -Why would he take you to church? -He didn't say. THORN: Why do you think? I think he just wanted to have somebody along. He was very strange towards the end. He didn't touch me for months. I saw him cry more than once. THORN: Old people do that. Do they? I can't figure this Simonson. If I was like him. rich. important... ...plenty to eat... ...real bourbon... ...and a girl like you... ...you wouldn't see me in church. What are you doing here? I've been looking all over the building for you. I'll teach you to break my rules! [SCREAMING] Furniture stays in units! I've told you before. FURNITURE GIRL: No! -I mean it!

I have no recollection. -You talked to him. -Did I? THORN: No doubt about it. A rich man. Yes. I remember. We don't see rich people here anymore. There isn't even enough room for the poor. There's just too many. Far too many. -Fa-- -My memory's eroded. Do you need some space? I need to know what he said to you. -Are you sure he's dead? -Yes. -Rea||y dead? -He's dead. -What did he talk to you about? -Come back tomorrow. I'm very tired. THORN: Father. Father. did you hear his confession? There should be a requiem mass. but there's no room. -Should I make room? -This is very important. I can't help you. Forgive me. It's destroying me. -What is? -The truth. The truth Simonson told you? -A|| truth. -What is it? What did he confess? Sweet Jesus. You heard me. The Simonson case is officially closed.

MAN: This was once called Gramercy Park. Now it's the only tree sanctuary in New York. Not at all. Donovan. Not at all. Your secretary told me where to find you. It's urgent... -...or I wouldn't have come out here. -I understand. Now. what is it? I'm to inform you the board is determined to resolve... ...the Simonson investigation immediately. sir. -I thought it was resolved. -Yes. sir. Oh. Perhaps because he went to church yesterday. -What does that mean? -It was Simonson's church. The cop spoke 20 minutes with the priest. So? The same priest who heard Simonson's confession. I don't wanna hear any more about it. I can't hear any more about it. Just do what you have to do. Bless me. Father. for I have sinned. It has been six months since my last confession.

When you gonna make the announcement? As soon as I get up the nerve. About five minutes. I guess. Better pass the word. THORN: Right. KULOZIK: This is the police. This is the police. This is the police. [BOOING] I am asking you to disperse. The supply a! Soylent Green has been exhausted. You must evacuate the area. The scuups are on their way. The scuups are on their way!

I did the best I could... ...but I still think you should go see the police doctor. He might relieve me from duty. You need a rest. -We could go to another city. -What for? They're all like this. -The country? -That's not allowed. Those farms are like fortresses. -Why? -Good land's gotta be guarded... ...and Soylent factories and the plankton ships. You know. there are idiots in this world who wanna take everything we've got. It means there's no place for us to go. That's right. Why should we? You be careful now. Keep the scanners on. Don't go anyplace without a bodyguard. The new tenant comes tonight. He'll like you. You're a hell of a piece of furniture. Don't talk to me like that. Please. Okay. It's horrible. EXCHANGE LEADER: You must accept it. Believe. The evidence is overwhelming. -Simonson was a member of the board. -Yeah. The corporation knew... ...he was not reliable anymore. They feared he might talk... ...and so he was eliminated. -Then why are they doing this? -Because it's easier. I think â€œexpedientâ€œ is the word. Good God. What God. Mr. Roth? Where will we find him? Perhaps at home. Yes. at home. I waited two whole damn years for an apartment to open up in this building. It's a nice place. -How long have you been here? -A long time.
