"Lets keep it at 12500 minimum and the starting price be at 15000 yen" "Would that be alright?" yes, of course Thanks "By the way,sir" "what time will you be coming in?" around noon I think I can go "As I mentioned before" "I think we should label all the products" The price label value?

No! Comfort is the first Oh,Tatsuko Take out all my obi and kimono from the closet What? And chose one for yourself as a gift from me Maam youre not thinking of Call the antique kimino dealer and have him look Im sure we can sell my kimonos for quite a price Please re-think this maam Im asking you Good morning! Good morning! Soon for the festival! I feel so happy today Mrs. Chizuko! Ito-chan... Ill just wash this again Ito-chan!! Remember when Mr. Tokita came from the head office and he said we are in the food industry at the time I covered up for you but you come in looking like that now I just cant! Thank you for everything What are you saying? No, I don't mean it No, no, Ito-chan no you cant just quit! Im terribly sorry for all the disturbances I caused, Im sorry No... What are you saying? Thank you for everything wait... Wait, Ito-chan! Why do you look at me with such a fierce gaze? No Im not watching you We are in favor for the Uzu family for several generations Actually There is a deeper fate than you Im not trying a trick or anything Im just thinking of how the Mrs.must feel I know... Its not rare So many people sell their kimonos because it's become rare to wear kimonos and they're bulky Now I know those kimonos have not been dead stocks but madam always wears the kimonos properly they are pleased to be worn by her So.. which one will it be? Sorry? You are going to be taking one home, right? well I really dont know anything about kimonos well... What are you watching for? I'm just... Its alright just chose the one that calls to you Whether it be expensive or not the one you pick will be the right fit for you Please Then this one Oh, my... What? You might have an extraordinary eye expensive? Madam! Good afternoon For our festival Thanks a lot But people are irresponsible What? People of various religions or do not have even the faith gather at this Shinto shrine only at the time of children's Ceremony, Festival, and New Years day Thats OK Why? Buddhism, Islam, Christianity each words and manners, the names of God are different but what all of us pray is the same unexpectedly even the person who does not believe in a special God sometimes they look up at the sky or the mountains and they pray somewhere For family security, the great desire of accomplishment and daily peace May not there be a place and time that anyone is heard all together? I do not know whether he is small or big whether he is near or far away but God is connected with each one directly I see We will help a little for that time and place Thank you again Although this is likely to be the last time Please dont say such things 1000 years, it's been I know It should not matter anymore family lineage, blood lines we do not need to rely on such manners Time will move on and on And... And what? It must end, someone make it end then I feel such things you do look very elegant in these western clothes You think so? I was afraid I would be sad a little but I'm feeling breezy! Breezy! is it? Yes, it is breezy! Itll be the festival Yes, our festival Good evening young master Uzu Well... what do you... I always get the deluxe My staff says I should change things up sometime Do you have any recommendations?

Ms. Akane this is the lady from the bento store shes hurt and I was hoping you could care too Please, this way Col... ouch Well... What should I do? its nothing, Im sorry You cant do anything What? Eyes are weak Arms without strength People try to find a way out of deep trouble but your damaged heart will never find the answer Your wounded body doesn't have any power remaining if you try to do something So there's nothing you can do now no matter how much you think Its too late No the time will come But before you think before you stand up you must regain your power In your heart and body The power is the first Even if you might have negative power Even if... strong anger What? The anger causes your blood to boil It'll make your body stir up and keep your soul strong with the soul and a body ascertain your way But I cant such a... For example deep hatred What? hatred?

I had to suppress the princess to channel her anger into a monster There was no other way You mean you had contained me? What? What are you talking about? Ito-chan? Teruaki Uzu Will you say you know nothing? Princess! No wonder it is They were living peacefully after having taken the land away from us and ended their happy life So There was nothing left to do but leave things in its course You bastard! Teruaki Uzu! Princess Ito!! You've been waiting for 1000 years just for this purpose It is a road to damnation if it is accomplished now you can never return Princess Ito has become...
