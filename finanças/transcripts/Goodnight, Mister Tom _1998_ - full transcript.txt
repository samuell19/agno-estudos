( birds singing, church bells pealing ) ( radio tuning through stations and static ) Radio announcer: ...Seeds, wait until the fruit is nearly... ( crowd laughs ) Vicar: Sorry about that. BBC announcer: This is London. You will now hear a statement by the prime minister. Chamberlain: I am speaking to you From the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street. This morning the British ambassador in Berlin Handed the German government a final note Stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00 That they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops From Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking Has been received And that consequently This country is at war with Germany. ( crowd gasps ) Give them an inch, they take a yard. Excuse me. Oh, um, Mr. Oakley... I thought I spotted you sitting at the back there. You've heard that our choirmaster, Walter Wingate Has just been called up... No. Which does rather present us with a bit of a problem. Oh. Only I have it on good authority That you're something of a musician yourself? I used to play the organ a bit, if that's what you mean. Doesn't mean I know anything about choirs-- Or would want to. We all have to do our bit, you know-- it's your duty. And when I need you to tell me What my duty is, Mrs. Ford, I'll let you know. At least tell me you'll think about it, Mr. Oakley. I'll think about it. ( stationmaster blows whistle, train chugs off ) Now wait here... Well? You realize that I am the billeting officer for this area? What's that to do with me? His name is William beech, and his mother says She'll only let him be evacuated if he's put with someone Who's either religious or lives near a church. And the home office says it is obligatory to take one. So I'm sorry, Mr. Oakley But he just has to go somewhere. You'd best come in then. Come on. Well, take your mac off. Look... If you've had enough, leave it. So, where you from? ( clears throat ) London. ( chair scrapes ) Look, uh, I have to go out. You'll be all right for a bit on your own, will you? Yeah. Right. Have a look outside if you want. ( door opens, then bangs shut ) Tom: I'm not having him and that's that. What do I know about kids of that age? Excuse me, Mr. Oakley, you have got him Whether you like it or not. And if you don't-- Well, you're just going to have to lump it, aren't you? For what it's worth, I wasn't happy About leaving the child with you either But I'm afraid it's a case of needs must, Mr. Oakley. There's not another spare bedroom going In the entire village. Then try another village. That is out of the ques... No! We all have to put our shoulders To the wheel, Mr. Oakley-- Even you. There is a war on, you know. Woman: Hello. You're one of the London lot, aren't you? Yes, miss. And a regular wild bunch, too, I've heard. Man: What's your name, then? William beech. Well, William beech I expect I'll be seeing you in my class shortly. And it's not "miss," it's "missus." Mrs. Hartridge, all right? So who are you billeted with, then? He lives there. Oh, you mean Tom. Well, good-bye, William. ( dog barks ) Get away! Get away or I'll kill you! Now, we'll have no talk about killing, all right? Because I reckon we've got about enough of that already. Now, as far as the dog's concerned It's my dog there. His name's Sammy, and he's soft as me pocket really. So don't you go taking no more sticks to him. Do you hear? ( poker sizzling ) Well, now what? ( Sam barking ) ( Sam continues barking ) ( birds chirping outside ) ( church bell rings ) Woman: Dear sir or madam I asked if Willie could go and stay With God-fearing people So I hope he has. Like most boys, he's full of sin But he has promised to be good. But just in case, I've put the belt in. ( belt buckle clanks softly ) Good night, then. Good night, mister. You can... Call me Tom. ( from bedroom ): Good night, Mr. Tom. Sorry, mister. Get them wet things off. And the jacket. Now, here's the post office. If you just get a stamp And post this for me While I have a quick word with the doctor. Woman: Your mum won't be able to read that. Yes, she will. She's got one of these, too. And this way, you see You get twice as much on. Thank you. You see, when I got him up this morning I found he'd wet the bed. A not uncommon occurrence, Tom. With a child who's been ripped out of his home Practically by the roots And dumped in some alien place. But what am I supposed to do about it? What we're all having to do these days, Tom. Oh? The best we can Under the circumstances. So, what's your name? William, William beech. What's yours? Zacharias wrench-- My parents' idea of a joke, I think. But you can call me Zach. Who've they put you with? Mr. Tom. I'm here with the doctor and his wife-- Friends of my mum and dad's. It'll come in handy, I suppose... If I'm ever ill. You all right? Yeah. Come on, then. See you around. Yeah. Bye. Good lads. Have you got your Anderson up yet? It's been delivered. I'll send the lads round if you like-- Give you a hand. I can manage, thanks. Who said you couldn't? You still a member of that knitting circle Round at the church? Of course. Only, um... You'll have heard I've been landed With one of these evacuees. Talk of the village. I'll bet. Only the only clothes he's got Are what he's standing up in, you see. You haven't got to clothe them, you know. I wasn't planning to. I was wondering if... Between you you could, like Rustle him up a couple of things. I'll think about it. For me? Well, who else? Well, come on, let's see if they fit. Never mind. Come on, then. ( Sam whimpering ) Now, I thought You were supposed to be helping. Me new shirt will get dirty. Then take it off. Go and change it, then. Aren't you roasting In that jumper, William? No. He's got a temperature, hasn't he? Trying to sweat it out of himself If you must know. Well, come on, then, chop-chop. Want this finishing by tonight. I'm going over To the church for a bit. Back in about an hour. All right? All right. ( organ playing ) %% and did those feet in ancient times... %% No, just a minute, just a minute. I mean... Have I been wasting my time these last months Or what? It's uplifting people want, not burying! Now, start again! Let's put a bit of beef into it this time! Some sort of problem, is there, Mr. Oakley? Nothing I can't sort out... If left to get on with it. Right. Now, this time I want to hear you. All right?! So...

William? Have you no more sense Than to be out here at this time of night?! Do you want to catch your death?! You said we had to finish it tonight. What?! All right, come inside, then. Come on. ( sighs ) ( William pounding on organ ) Don't you ever touch that instrument again Without my permission. Is that clear? I'm... Going fishing this afternoon if you want to come. Need any help? I think I can just about manage, thanks. Is will about? We were just off out, actually. Oh... Going somewhere nice? Fishing. Really? Can I come? Afternoon. ( plane flying low ) Wow! Well, cheer up. It's only school you're going off to, you know Not your own hanging. Got everything, have you? Right. Off you go, then. ( children laughing and shouting ) Zach: Will! Will! ( young children singing in distance ) I'm sorry, William. It's the door just across the hall. Now, what's the matter? They put me with the babies. Can we have a word? Of course, Mr. Oakley. William tells me You've put him in the babies' class. That's right, Mr. Oakley. Well, would you mind telling me why When you've got all his friends in your class? Because they can read and write. Tom: Now, join up the dots And see what you end up with. Never mind. Now... Try again Only this time, take your time. Don't try stabbing it to death. Here you are. Have another go. It's bad, isn't it? No, it isn't! Not bad at all. Now, just get on with the next one. That's it. There you are, you see. You've written your own name. Oh, Mr. Tom! Now... Draw a line under that And get it copied. And before you do, just you draw me another line. Them's straighter than I can do with a ruler. Wherever did you learn To do that? Just did it. Go on, then, get it copied. Won't I go to hell? Hell? Only you go to hell if you copy, don't you? It's cheating. Well, whatever lunatic told you that? Never mind, just do it... And if a chap with horns And a pitchfork comes looking for you We'll blame me, all right? "the tinder box." "a soldier was marching along the high road Right-left, right-left..."

"in loving memory of Rachel Oakley "aged 27 years "a dearly beloved wife. "also John Oakley, aged five years A dear son, now with God." And did they just die? No... They caught Scarlatina. What's Scarlatina? A disease-- a killer. At least in them days. Two weeks, it was all over... Or so I'm told. Why didn't you catch it? Because I wasn't here, was I? No, I was on a ship on convoy duty Fighting for king and country, as they say. What was he like-- John? Oh, he was bright as a button, sharp as sixpence. Bit naughty sometimes But... Full of life... To the brim. In fact, very much like her, really. Anyway, what's this? Out here in your 'jamas and not even dressed yet. I wanted to show you something. Oh? Come on. Come on. ( William panting ) Well? Dry, Mr. Tom, it's dry. That's great, William, that's really great! Tom: Two and six? This is quality stuff, Mr. Oakley. ( thunder rumbling ) So this is Where you've been hiding yourself. You do realize your tea's been on the table For nearly half an hour Do you? Sorry, Mr. Tom. I should think you are. %% happy birthday to you %% %% happy birthday to you %% %% happy birthday, dear William %% %% happy birthday to you. %% ( all clapping and cheering ) Go on, then, blow. Zach: If you manage To blow them all out You get to make a wish. ( all talking at once ) Woman: Anybody want the last rock cake? ( kids laughing ) So didn't she even send him a card, then? Nothing. Shame on her. Now, come on, let's have a tune out of you. Come on, Alice, you know better than to ask that. Look, Rachel wouldn't have thanked you For letting it rot away in the corner Just because she's not here to play it anymore. You can't grieve forever, Tom. ( kids laughing and tooting noisemakers ) Boy: Pop it-- pop the balloon. ( balloon pops ) ( kids laughing ) ( kids talking and laughing in background ) ( tones begin to emerge ) ( playing "it's a long way to Tipperary" ) All: %% ...It's a long way to go %% %% it's a long way to Tipperary %% %% to the sweetest girl I know %% %% good-bye, Piccadilly %% %% farewell, Leicester square %% %% it's a long, long way to Tipperary %% %% but my heart's right there. %% Well done, Tom. ( all clapping ) ( all calling good-bye ) Night. Night, William. Oh, and, uh... This is for you as well, by the way. Nearly forgot to give it to you. Happy birthday. Thanks, Mr. Tom. This has been the best time I've had in me whole life. ( retching ) Obviously. Come in. Mrs. Black said I were to see you Before I went home. That's right, William. I've got a bit of news for you. Mr. Tom, I've been moved up to Mrs. Hartridge's class! She says I can read and write good enough now. It's from your mum, William. Seems she's not been very well. Wants you back. Where have they come from, Mr. Tom? Place called Dunkirk... And lucky to get out alive, I heard. Walk on. ( steam engine whistles ) Now, don't forget to write. And, um, if you do change your mind About them paintings of yours You just let me know And I'll post them to you, all right? They belong here with you And anyway, they'll still be here When I get back, won't they? Course they will. I will be coming back Won't I? Course you will. Now, you just take good care of yourself Do you hear? You just take your time. You haven't seen your mother for a few months So... It's bound to be a bit awkward at first. I'll miss you. You'll, uh, make sure he gets off all right? Don't worry. ( train whistle blows ) Here you are, then, son. Rise and shine. Station announcer: ...On platform four. Willie? You look different. Put weight on. See, I'll take... ( slaps ) I'll say What to take And not to take. So, how are you feeling now? Fine... I'm fine. Only they said you was ill. Did they? So... What you got in the bag, then? Just me things And a present for you from Mr. Tom. Mr. Tom? Mr. Oakley, the man I stays with down there. Well, I don't need charity, thank you. It's just some bed socks. And Mrs. Little-- that's the doctor's wife-- She sent you a bottle of tonic wine. Wine?! Haven't I told you about the evils of drink?! It ain't a real drink, mum Like you get in a pub. It's got iron in it To help you get your strength back. And what would you know About what you get in a pub? When we get home I want no noise from you, all right? Why? Because nobody has to know That you're here, that's why. And when we get inside I've got a surprise for you. ( unlatching door ) What's that smell? What smell? Doesn't matter. Not a dog, is it, this surprise? What surprise? This surprise you've got for me. It's over there... In the box. ( crying ) It's a baby. It's a present from Jesus. Don't you dare! A bit of discipline, that's all she needs. ( crying continues ) She's just a baby, mum. Sit down! Now! My God, but isn't my life bad enough as it is? Stuck here on me own in this house Night after night Frightened half out of me head half the time Without you starting? What are you frightened of, mum? The air raids, is it? The air raids... Look, if we're killed, we're killed And that's God's will, right? So what are you frightened of, then? By what's going on out there, of course. Oh, Willie, if you knew... If you only knew what's going on out there-- The filth... ( grimly ): The rising tide of filth. Perhaps you should see somebody, mum. Like who? Like an head doctor, perhaps? That's what you think, is it? That perhaps I'm off my head Just because I know what's going on out there? You just keep a civil tongue in your head, my lad Or else. You have brought it back, haven't you-- the belt? I forgot. Liar. Liar! You left it behind on purpose, didn't you? No, mum, honest! But I can get another. I know a shop Where they sell lots of them. Now, get upstairs Out of my sight! ( baby crying ) And you can shut up and all! ( crying continues ) ( pans clattering ) ( cats yowling ) ( baby fussing ) Your favorite. Certainly got your appetite back, anyway. Must be all that fresh air, I expect. Oh... Such a beautiful baby you were, though. Proud as punch I was, wheeling you out in your pram-- Sun shining, people stopping Just stopping just to look at you. "where do you get him from, then, missus, Heaven?" Happiest days of my entire life then, Willie. Finished? Mum? What's this? My present to you. It was Mr. Tom's idea. Mr. Tom? I told you, the man I stay with down there. Well, go on, open it. It's where I live down there. Did you steal this? I did it meself. Liar. I did, mum, honest I did. And these? Where did these come from then, eh?! Did you steal these as well?! They were presents from Ginnie and Carrie. Girls? You've been mixing with girls down there? But they're nice, mum And they all go to church-- Well, except Zach, of course. Zach? He's me best friend. And why doesn't he go to church, then? Because they ain't got one down there-- A synagogue, I mean. A synagogue? That's what they call their church, the synagogue. He's Jewish? You're telling me That you've been consorting with Jews down there? But what's wrong with Jews, mum? Like Zach says, Jesus was a Jew, wasn't he? Blasphemer. Blasphemer! You know what we do with blasphemers in this house?! No, mum! Please! Not there! Please, mum, not there! ( baby crying ) ( playing "it's a long way to Tipperary" slowly ) Radio announcer: The German raiders are leaving blazing and destroyed buildings. Overhead I can hear the pulsing drone of the circling bombers. Below ground in the shelters, men, women and children listen To the muffled sounds of bombs and antiaircraft fire. Zach: Mr. Oakley? Still no news, then? Afraid not. Contact him, Mr. Oakley? Only I thought I'd have heard from him by now, you see. It's been over a month. It does tend to happen like that, you know Once they get back into the home environment. ( Sam whimpering ) ( air raid siren begins blaring ) Warden: Everybody, down in shelter! Lost are we, sir? Looks like it? Never mind about that now. Let's get down the shelter. Come on. Come on. Come on, hurry up! I'm sorry, mate, no dogs allowed in the shelter. So what am I supposed to do with him, eh? Leave him out here to be blown to bits? Oh, come on, then. And he definitely didn't run away, you say? Only it's happening all the time-- Kids just taking off, coming back to London. No question of that. Look, I just want to make sure He's all right, that's all. And you've got an address for him round here, have you? Well, come tomorrow morning, God willing We'll see if we can find him for you, shall we? ( bomb exploding ) ( whimpering ) ( baby crying ) ( all-clear siren blowing ) Young couple, just married. He was home on embarkation leave. And are they... Are they both? Oh, yeah. Bloody, bloody war. Well, I suppose you'll be wanting to find This kid of yours, right? If it's not... Just give me ten minutes, will you? Of course. ( knocking on door ) If it's Mrs. Beech you're wanting, she's not here. Do you know where she's gone? To the coast, she said. What about the boy? Did he go with her? Can't remember ever seeing any boy. Little lad, ten years old. Oh, young Willie, you mean. Evacuated to the country, last I heard. Probably just as well-- Quiet boy, no friends as such, bullied a lot. Sitting target, really. I mean, this house-- real house of mystery, you know. You don't half hear some funny things sometimes. What sort of things? Well, whimpers sometimes, bumps. Bumps? Like somebody humping furniture about. Well, people do move furniture about. Huh, at 3:00 in the morning? So when did you last see her? About a week ago. In fact, I nearly dropped dead with shock When she condescended to speak to me. Talk about la-di-da. ( Sam whimpering ) There's nobody in there, Rover. Not like him to make a fuss over nothing, though. Smell something, do you? Uh, look, I'll see if I can find a copper. Oi, hang on a minute. Cor, what died in here, then? ( Sam whining ) Quiet, Sam. Here, let me. ( groans ) God almighty What the hell's been going on here? All right, let me have the baby, son. Get away. Let me. What's his name, then, William? It's an her. I call her Trudy. Trudy. That's a nice name. Are you going to let me have a hold, then? ( sniffling ): Why didn't you come? I kept calling for you, but you didn't come. ( moaning and mumbling ) ( shrieks ) ( shrieking continues ) ( Sam whining ) Keep an eye on him, will you? Thanks. ( Sam whining ) He's in deep shock, Mr. Oakley. We've had to keep him well sedated, I'm afraid. Well... Saves combing, I suppose. How are you feeling now? I had a nightmare. They stuck this needle in me. Can't I come home with you, Mr. Tom? Nurse: I'm afraid You have to leave now. Don't go. Stay a bit more. Now, you just concentrate On getting yourself better. All right? Man: Not something I have a lot of Faith in myself, mind you-- Drugging them. You'll be Mr. Tom, then? Tom Oakley. My name's Stelton. I'm a psychiatrist. I work in conjunction with the children's home. Our feeling is That he'd benefit from treatment there. What sort of treatment? Psychiatric treatment. I'd like him to come back home with me. As I understand it You aren't actually related to him, Mr. Oakley. So, are there any other relatives Who'd take him in? Well, that's, of course, something That we would have to go into. And if there aren't? As I said, there is the children's home. ( Sam barks and whimpers ) ( door closes ) ( horse snorts ) Mr. Tom? How did I get here? I kidnapped you. Oh. That's what I did, boy, I kidnapped you. I kidnapped you. ( chuckles heartily ) ( loudly ): I kidnapped you! Well, they seem to have patched you up Pretty well at the hospital, William. Now, you just settle down And I'll call in to see you again tomorrow. All right? The sores will soon heal, of course. It's the wounds inside That we need to worry about. Right. And you do realize, don't you, Tom That sooner or later They're bound to come looking for him. No. No, they're far too busy to go chasing evacuees. Besides, they didn't even know he was in London. She saw to that. Good night, then, Tom. Night, doctor. Oh, and, uh You will let young Zach know he's back? You mean he hasn't been round here yet? ( chuckles ) No, no, no, no, no! No, no! Get away! Hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now, come on. It's him, Mr. Tom. It's him. ( panting ) Don't you ever knock? Sorry. So, can I see him today, Mr. Oakley? When he's had his breakfast you can. But he takes ages. You know what he's like. He chews everything. I thought we all did. Not everybody. I just give mine a quick bite and swallow it. William: Mr. Tom? Yes? Is that Zach down there? Go on, then. Take that up. Thanks, Mr. Oakley. So, what's been happening while I've been away? Not a lot. Been dead boring, really. Oh, except Mrs. Hartridge's husband got shot down And killed. Least they never found him. But she still had the baby okay. Baby? You did know she was having a baby? No. But you must have noticed how big she'd got. You do know about sex and stuff Don't you? Only it's something dirty and you go to hell for it. That's rubbish, will. Zach: My dad says sex is Just a man and a woman's way Of showing how much they love each other. We wouldn't be here If it wasn't for sex-- any of us. But can't a lady have a baby on her own? ( laughs ) Of course not. There has to be a man involved. Right, Zach, home time for you, I think. Don't want William overdoing it. But I can come And see him tomorrow, Mr. Oakley? Course you can. In that case I'll see you tomorrow, then, will. So, what was all that about, then? Zach says a lady can't have a baby Without a man. Oh, yeah? Is that right? Yeah. Trudy's dead, isn't she? I think you knew that already, didn't you? And I killed her. You killed her? I should have got out-- I did try. Honest, I did. Well, of course you did. Only you were tied up-- right? Only what you have to remember is That the way she treated you and the baby Was because your mum was sick, William. In fact, very sick, I'd say, to do what she did. The trouble was With this war on People so busy surviving themselves to even notice So there was no one to help. Hello! What are you doing here? I've come to see Mrs. Hartridge. She's round the back. ( gurgles ) Hello, William. Now... This is my Peggy... Who looks just like her dad, they reckon. ( baby cooing ) So, how are you feeling now? I'm all right. Oh, well, at least you're back safe and sound anyway, eh? So, how about a glass of lemonade, then? Yeah, please. Then you just hold on to my Peggy for me, will you While I get it? ( baby cooing ) That's where my dad's based-- In the east end. He'll be all right. Course he will. I'm afraid we have some bad news for you, William. It's about your mother. She don't want me back again, does she? She's dead, William. Dead? I'm afraid she drowned herself, son. Now, Dr. Stelton's here from a children's home In Sussex. Lovely place from what I'm told. Right out in the country. I'm sure you're going to like it there, William. I want to stay here with Mr. Tom. Tell them, Mr. Tom. I want to stay here with you. Now, then, that's enough of that, my lad. Mr. Oakley is in trouble enough as it is. It's a serious offense, is kidnapping. I weren't kidnapped; I were rescued. Why doesn't William wait upstairs? Go on, then, up you go. William. The man in your dream-- Is that him, the one with the moustache? Right. This, uh, children's home You're on about taking him to. Oh, yes? You're in charge there, are you? That's right. Only... He's been having these nightmares, you see Ever since I got him back here. It's hardly surprising, Mr. Oakley After all he's... About you, apparently. Me, Mr. Oakley? That you're going to come and take him away again. In fact, he wakes up regularly Screaming about it. All of which bears out What I've just been saying, I think: What the lad needs is specialist medical treatment. What the lad needs is love Dr. Stelton Something he hadn't seen a lot of, apparently Before he came to me. Now, are you people Really trying to tell me That he's going to get more of that Where you're on about taking him to Than he is here? Because if you are, I'm telling you You're talking a right load of rubbish. Mr. Oakley Dr. Stelton is One of the very best people in his field And you can take it from me That along with the rest of us His one and only concern here Is for the boy's own welfare. Let's get a spot of fresh air Shall we, Mr. Oakley? ( door opens and closes ) But then it isn't the boy's welfare This is all about Really, is it, Mr. Oakley? Isn't it? No, it's about you, I'd say... Your welfare. Me?! A lonely and, from what I hear, embittered old man Facing a lonely and bitter old age. You really think That's the only reason I want him back? Just to be company for me when I'm past it? Well, isn't it? No! It bloody well isn't! And I resent the implication! Doesn't it bother you at all that when you're 70 He's still going to be in his teens? Course it bothers me. I'm not stupid, you know. There's not a lot we can do about that, is there? Look, I know it's not an ideal situation-- Anything but, but... Well, put it this way: It's got to be a damn sight more ideal Than your Dr. Stelton in there Turning him into some sort of human guinea pig. Just tell me one thing, Mr. Oakley. Why is the boy suddenly so important to you? He's an evacuee, for God's sake. And one at that, as I understand it You took violent exception To having foisted on you in the first place. Isn't it obvious? Not to me, no. Nor to Dr. Stelton. Because I love him, of course... As if he was my own flesh and blood, I do. And for what it's worth, I think he loves me as well. And is that really enough, do you think In this day and age? Well, I suppose it has to be Hasn't it, Mr. Greenway? In this day and age or any other Because if it isn't... What else is there, eh? ( door opens and closes ) I won't go with them, Mr. Tom. I won't go with them! ( sternly ): Oh, won't you? No, I won't! Just as well, then, isn't it? Because nobody's asking you to. What? Come here. You see that one in the dark suit? William: Yeah. Well, he's from something called the home office And he reckons That after all the trouble you've caused He don't want you back anymore, thanks, so... As long as I adopt you All legal and proper like Looks like I'm stuck with you, doesn't it? Oh, Mr. Tom! ( car driving away ) Mrs. Little, can I see Zach? Only I've got some really great news to tell him. Of course you can, William. ( breathlessly ): Thank you. He's upstairs... Packing. Packing? Yes... You see He's just had some news himself-- Not very good news in his case, I'm afraid. I got a phone call from my mum. They bombed the docks. My dad was there. I'm sure he'll be all right, of course. Take more than a German bomb to stop him. Only I have to go and see him... Just in case he's... ( airplanes roaring ) Are they going to bomb us, Mr. Tom? They're saving them for London, I expect. ( airplanes roaring overhead ) ( Sam whimpering ) Radio announcer: This is the BBC home service. Here is the news. Last night's mass air raid on London is estimated to have been The heaviest of the war so far. At least 400 people have been killed And 1,400 seriously injured. Fires are still burning all over the city And many homes in the east end have been razed to the ground. The fire and the rescue ser... ( clicks radio off ) Boy: Stop pushing. Woman: Come along, that's it. Boy: I wasn't pushing... ( train whistle blows ) Oh... William. William... Has anybody any idea where William is today? Class: No, Mrs. Hartridge.
