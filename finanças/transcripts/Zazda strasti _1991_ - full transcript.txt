Ah! It is you. I'm glad. Maybe I even waited for you. What are we gonna do? Are we gonna stay home? Okay, okay. I agree. Well? Why are you keeping silent? Smile! Horrible scene. Yeah, inspector, I bet you have to see things like that pretty often. It happens. These kind of barbarities happens more rarely than catarrh, though. How long have you been her attending doctor? I was caring for her family for three years ever since they've married, when they both were alive. - Incredible. Do you believe in fate? - No. First the husband... now her. Could you please help me check the house out? Yes, of course. - Shit! - Mr. Inspector! Mr. Inspector. The maid said all the silver is in it's place. Madam kept the jewels in her husband's safe. It's alright. I mean, the safe is locked. Mr. Inspector. I was normally here at 9 a.m. buzzing and she was opening by herself. - The windows are locked, too. - And when I came this time I buzzed over and over again. Get the girl out of here. - I buzzed over and over and over... - Get the girl out of here. Tell her if we need her we'll let her know. - I was the one who called the police! I was! I was! - Come on, come on. Please. Please. Please. Yes. - Were there any other dailies? - Recently madam was... She fired all her servants, but the daily one who was going out from morning till afternoon. She was afraid recently. No, I don't know. There weren't any other servants. Excuse me. Yes, speak. It didn't ring. What about the girl we've seen at the ladder? Maybe. I haven't seen her before. I thought you said you used to come to the house. After the husband's death, I haven't been in the house for a month. She was visiting me. I said she was afraid. She fired all her servants. - In that case I'm gonna have to call you. - Young man... You're strongly requested to execute my instructions right to a T. - I got it. - And refer to former servants please. Got it. "Got it". There was a mirror. A very valuable one. The mistress didn't like it for some reason. She ordered to lock it in a box and take it out somewhere. She was sick. She was brain-sick. Excuse me, Inspector. If you need me, I am always at your disposal. Take care. - It is you! - Tell me, are you getting a peep of the funeral because of unappeased sexualism or it's some kind of frenzy? - Should I smile? - Well, if you think it's funny. - Let's walk. - Okay. - How long have you been spying on me? - An unwanted question. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Tell me, were you absolutely sure she was dead? - What do you think? Her brains were beaten in. She... I gotta explain. She was sick. She was suffering from hallucinations. She was visiting me in the day when her husband got killed. And she told me... Will you have a seat with me? - What is it? - Maybe we'll go together, huh? - No. - I won't be boring there with you. - And they'll be glad you came. - Please. - Don't you want? - Please, let me go. Do me a favor. Please, go away. Please let me take a rest. I haven't slept all the night. Why not? Look, I don't hold it against you. You're free to go. - I'm just tired. - Won't you kiss me? Well. Don't expect I'll be back at dinner time. Who are you? Why did you come here? Will you believe it if I say why I did? Why did you raise me from the dead? - I did not call you. - I heard a moaning and an appeal. What deliverance were you appealing for? Don't you remember? Do you want me to tell you what that was? No. Do you want me to tell you the truth? No! No! No! - Well? - What? - What was wrong with her, really? - Meaning? Is that all you were gonna say to me? - Yes. - Thank you. Nice chatting with you. Tell me, didn't you prescribe her morphine before that visit? I think medication orders were kept somewhere in the bureau. There are dates. - You didn't answer. - No. Thank you. - What are YOU doing here? - The deputy of yours... He's been interrogating me. Right here. - Can I go? - Yes. - Mr. Inspector... I'll explain... - You can go, too. Go. Mr. "Got it". Sometimes I think I'm not the one it's happening to. And I'm just an indifferent onlooker who's watching me from outside. But sometimes... and that's what it's all about, doctor. That... some kinda wild power starts to fly around me. Let me go, retard! Bastard! It shows me a different way. I feel I won't be unable to resist it. What's happening to me, doctor? It was just a dream. A conscious idea. You're tired. Relax. Realize that your visions... Why did you show up? Once I stood near bed-head of yours... I've seen your sufferings. And you enjoyed it didn't you? No. I felt a shame and a rage. I've seen traces of beating on your hands which were tied up to the bed. Nothing is happening. You got to sleep. Sleep. Take a rest. It's all gonna go away. Your visions... are a counterpart of your shell. - Why are you lying to me? - I've seen him come to your private room. Touched you. You belonged to him. - And then he went away as a winner. - Who's he? Your husband. Relax. You're strong. You're perfectly healthy. It's just a flight of your imagination. Open your eyes. Take this daily. - How do you feel? - Good. - Doctor, what do I do if this shows up again? - Smile and say: "You're a phantom of the imagination." Come in, come in. Hold on. I'll just read the daily report and call to the "sinless man". He'd better be sleeping at night. Wait. Good night, lady. Excuse me. 25-75-9. - Mr. Inspector, it's me. - Are you having a lot of people there? Sounds like they're having a good time. It's the gramophone. I have some interesting information. I've already reported about... About... Could you please check it out? I think it's draught down there. - Who are you whispering with? - Mr. Inspector, I've already reported... I couldn't find former servants. They just vanished. And why did she fire the maid on the day her husband got killed? I know what are you hinting at. But now we have the victim, so we've got a lot of time. So, listen to some music. I'm sure you're tired because of the interrogations. Listen to me, Inspector. They found a burned-out beyond recognition corpse of a woman today. And this woman died about month ago, for sure. Well, check the card-catalogue of people gone missing a couple of months ago. - Well, if we think about that... - We will think when we get more facts. It's an order. What are you doing? Holy shit. Is that you? Did you work off? Open up! Open up! What are you doing down there? Hello? Yes. It'd be interesting if you spoke some nonsense, huh? You know sometimes it's so annoying though. Have nobody to speak with. You're a fool, Inspector. Son of a bitch! May I come in? What happened? It's nothing. You buzzed and I cut myself shaving. A little. - You gotta asepticize it. - Alcohol is in the closet. It's nothing. I just gotta take a rest. You thought some incredible things about me yesterday. Well, I think you aren't on top of issues, Mr. Inspector. Of course you've read files which are saying she came late from me that day and saw her husband get killed. - Yes, she had her alibi. - Throw back your head. Okay, stop it, let's speak openly. There isn't any witnesses. - Are you sure? - I said, stop it! The diaries of the dead woman vanished last night. There wasn't anybody in the house but me. - And I'm sure you know everything. - Let me go. Drop the gun. - I'm gonna peel your cap! - I came here to tell you everything. She came to my place twice the night of the murder. But nobody saw how she came and left. - So I was right! She was the one who killed her husband? - A woman can't hash a human like this. - You gotta have incredible power. - Maybe it was a crime of passion? When she came to me for the second time she was totally sane, totally! She told me everything. Come out. I know you're here! I hate your invisible presence! Show yourself! Or you come only when I'm helpless? I hate your superiority! You be damned! - What do you want? - Leave me alone! I don't need your compassion! I hate you! I hate you!!! Then why did you call me again? Make the choice! Nobody has the right to force you to live with the nonentity but you! - Give me your hand! - Nooo! Give me your hand! Otherwise the thing which is living inside you will suffer you! And you will be calling me again! - Nooo! - Give me your hand!! NO! Something happened with your car? Why are you looking like that? - Where have you been? - Leave me alone! I was at doctor's. Out of my way! I don't understand what's the reason of your condition. Tell me what's wrong with you? Why weren't you worried about it before? Why weren't you interested about my thoughts and feelings before? I'm waiting for answer! - You have to execute your marital duties! - I don't wanna hear a thing about my duties! For all these years I didn't interfere in your affairs! And now I tell you to leave me alone! You went beyond the pale last two days. I heard some moaning and screams from your room last night. Answer me! I can't. I can't answer anything. I think I can. I can show you 'where' is the solving of the problem. What is this? That where you found satisfaction? I warned you! I warned you you'd have to come up with a response! I demand for your conjugal fidelity right now and right here! - I can't explain anything! - Did you forget I have the capacity to force you to come up with a response! Did you forget the psychiatric hospital? Stay away! Why do you keep trying to hurt my pride? I'll solve your issues by myself! - I didn't want it! - Don't lie. You used to lie yourself. Nobody is between us now. So why are you afraid? You did call me. From now don't worry about anything. You'll come to the doctor's place and come back at night. You don't have a choice. I'm an offendress! Offendress! I have no right for forgiveness! It's all my fault! Help me! Help me! To the train station please. Where are we going? Oh God, where are we going? Young man, where are we going? Pull over! I wanna get out of here! Do you hear me? Take a deep breath and outwind. Now exhale slowly. Breath calm. It's okay. You're gonna feel better soon. Take this. Don't. Don't. I'm going to get you home and give the injection. - I won't get home. - You must. Pull yourself together. - If you aren't gonna bear down those hallucinations - Those aren't hallucinations. - Those aren't, doctor. - Yes, they are. - You have to bear them down. - They are not hallucinations. No. Since I was a kid I've been trying to hide my secret thoughts and feelings, doctor. I used to lie to myself, and say to myself commonplaces. But the hope has been living deep down, the lie's been hiding it. I've been hoping that some kind of secret power will appear and destroy all this falsehood. Will change my life and save me. I was waiting for this power. - I was calling it. I was. - Did you take another shot of morphine? Morphine? You prescribed me morphine? Why? Why? Don't you see, doctor? Your diagnosis is wrong. Your medication orders don't make any sense. You want to befuddle me? It's not a way out. It's a lie. Your thinking I'm sick is naive. I didn't say you were sick. I think you need to take a rest and sleep. - I need a poison! - What are you striving for? You don't trust me? I wanna help you. I'm trying to help! But you're really crazy! You're really crazy if you think you're obsessed by some kinda supernatural power! And now you're trying to make me believe it killed your husband! Call the police! You're scared! Get up! Come here! It's a mirror. It's an ordinary mirror. You have exactly what it shows. Same eyes, hair. Same lips, same body! My God. - So you were close with her. - Yes. But she was so sick. I mean not in the context of crime but of moral. Nobody cares about moral. I was ready to sacrifice everything for that moment. And I was hoping it'd turn out to be a dream like her evil spirit was. So the schizophrenic came at your place after she killed her husband... It wasn't her. - I was wrong. - But you confirm she was mentally competent. I've never seen her after the killing of her husband. It wasn't her! She was... locked. She was taking morphine and writing the diary you've read the truth. And I was visited by the spawn. I didn't want to say a word, because I was afraid. I didn't want to frighten away the devil. But four days ago the monster said it destroyed the mirror. And I realized this is the end. The devil caught hold of her soul. - And then you've tried to kill the spirit. - Yes. You left this there. Hurry! Hurry! Jump out! Jump out! Where is the mirror? - I don't know - Did she tell you where the mirror is? I don't know! This is the end! We lost! Oh my God! Shoot it! Shoot! Shoot! Get lost, Satan. You have an unlimited power, but you will not have a human soul! Get lost! I saved her immortal soul. Now she's at peace.
