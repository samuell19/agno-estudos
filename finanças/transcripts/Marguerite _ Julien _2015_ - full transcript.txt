"Marguerite and Julien de Ravalet" "lived very long ago." "This film is loosely based on their story." Julien, I'll always love you. Me too. Juliette said Jos?phine sawthem. No! Mathilde sawthem. A blue dress, her hair down. No, Juliette said she had pants and short hair. - No way! - I swear! She even sawthem kiss. Wild sex, I bet. Like this. Yeah, like that. What is it, virgins? Quiet! Why are you so worked up? Marguerite and Julien, ma'am. They're supposedly in town. Marguerite! Julien! Come back! Marguerite and Julien are siblings. He's older. Born in Tourlaville in a splendid chateau. In the chateau, servants for meals, chambermaids for bedtime. Night, dear. The estate was immense. A tropical greenhouse, rare plants from all over the world. Every day, brioche for breakfast. In the morning, classes at the chateau. The rest of the day, they could play. Julien adored his sister. He would stare at her for hours on end. She was more precious than a diamond. Can I have the pink? He drew her and enjoyed it. Marguerite was a perfect model. Her melancholy grace was charming. Raise your chin. Julien, will you love me when we're grown up? I'll always love you. I read palms. My sisterwanted hers read. At night, they stayed up and put on shows to amuse their parents. He's a bandit! To the dungeon. Luckythem. Parents, real parents, whom they loved. A brothertoo. May I go see him? Yes. You may speak through the bars. Five minutes. More than enough time to sayfarewell. Julian, it all could have been so differentfor us. If you just could breakfree. It's impossible. I'll love you always. Margaret. Jean... Marguerite's presence in class is not good for the boys. Why not? It's important to... set certain limits. Women have homes to keep, husbands to please, children to rear. School is not forthem. We're of a different mind, Uncle. We open the portals of knowledge to servants' and farmers' children. Stop these verbal games, this endless battle. Generosity and sharing are in my realm. You know it. Why not? I'm open-minded. I let you manage the familyfortune with a free hand. True. That's not the problem. The real problem is Marguerite. I fear she is leading Julien astray. Jean... you must separate them. Trust me. The boys should be in school. Julien... Let's go and see Pegasus. No one will see. Come! Pegasus. Pegasus! Julien! Marguerite! Help! Julien! Lord, help her. Give me your hand! Your hand! Come on, children. Julien! Get dressed. They're waiting downstairs. My boys... time to put aside the preciousness of life at home. And your childish games. You must now learn to behave seriously in society. You're off to boarding school. It's a long ride. Let's go. Marguerite and Julien are separated for many years. She learns to live farfrom him and he from her. "The hungrywolf does listen, his teary eyes do glisten. "He asks the dog about the spot on his neck. "'A tiny speck. It doesn't pain me. Comes from the collar with which they chain me."' Jacqueline, when will I see Julien again? Soon. Yes, butwhen? When school is over. Good night. But after school, Julien and Philippe studied art in ltaly, finance in England, weaponry in Germany, and finally, Paris, to learn about life. Meanwhile, Marguerite grew up. Long pastthe marrying age, she refuses every suitor to her parents' despair. Marguerite! A lot of pain? No, it stopped a few days ago. You needn't have bothered to get out of bed. No. I prefer to be here. Bed bores me. You're some expert. - Want to try? - Yes, it looks fun. Wait, I'll show you how. Gently, flat out. Here. No, this one is pretty. You should keep it. Having crossed oceans, seas, and rivers, having crossed plains, valleys, and every mountain, having traveled the world 10 times... 100 times, 1,000 times... Theywent backto the chateau. At a gallop! - Have my brothers come? - Yes, miss. - Where are they? - North tower. My Julien. You wear cologne? You smell different. Who is she? The widow. What widow? A young widow we see in Paris. - Go to the Court? - Yes. Give it back. See the king? He likes Uncle. And the king? Give it back. - Give it to me! - Take it. She's hideous. Less pretty than you. Hello, Philippe. You're country stock. They imagined a life of love fertile enough to fill vast solitude, overflowing with joy, braving adversity, resplendent and lofty, like the pulsing of stars. He contemplated her diaphanous skin, her fingers, each one more than a thing. Almost a person. Paris is huge, gorgeous. Fearsome too, dirty, dangerous, full oftemptations. Father, you're overdoing it or overtired. You're no strangerto Paris! Philippe, don't be presumptuous. I hope we haven't grown apart, and I won't consider your education a mistake. No mistakes. Just incomplete or inadequate ideas. What's inadequate is the use you make of your learning. Don't forgetwe don't study to show off knowledge but to make life easier. That's what knowledge is for. It comes from all over. It's there, waiting. Smile a bit. Look at me. I preferred when you drew me. Father wants your portrait. I'm obeying. Raise your chin. Do you still love me? Marguerite, a visitor. Marigny is in the parlor. Hurry. He's been waiting a while. He came just for you. One, two, three, four, five, six. Was I wrong? No. Your parents are relieved. I just find it a bit quick. You said to wed. Not the first comer. Want to know the truth? Yes. I accepted because I read that jealous men are in love. And so? So... So nothing. Speak, Julien. Is all well? Yes. You know... you can speakwithoutfear. You know that. Go on. Yes? Go on, Julien. I worry about Marguerite. Why? I don't know. You do. You knowfull well. I can't bear her marrying this Marigny. It's a masquerade. Really? You think so? Marigny... will make her a good husband. You mustn'tworry aboutthat. Listen to me. The bestwayto avoid sin is to flee temptation. Read this. Out loud. "I am not intelligent, Sire. "I am but a poorvillage girl, "one of many. Butwhen something is black, I can't say it's white." Did you know that animals know pity? Do they? Well, theyfeel it. You are the stuff of my dreams. Even dared imagining having a wife so stunning. Stunning daughter. Her melancholy grace is charming. Notvery hungry. Yes. I killed your appetite? Excuse me. I'll be right back. I like duck. Just grab the potatoes. You're struggling with the fork. Just grab them. Go away, please. "I can read palms. "My brother wanted his read. "With my mouth, I followed each line, "one after another, first to last." Even if I only get your crumbs, I'd take them over nothing. My crumbs? Yes. What's that? Is it this? Or this? Or this? - Want to play? - If you do. I'll go first. I choose ear, goose bumps. I win. My turn. I choose clever feet. You have a beautiful garden divided into several parts. There's a wonderful greenhouse. I wonder where the plants are from. Yes. I win. I choose... neck, blood. How shameful. Their coats. Where are they? Julien isn't in our room. His bed is made. And Marguerite? Not in her room either. - Too late. - Get some men. Find them. Yes, sir. Arrow. Whatwas it? Always. Again. - So? - No one. The greenhouse? Let's check the attic. Sorrow. What's going on? Get dressed! They're all over! Your father is furious! If he saw you... I'll explain. Why did you leave dinner? These secrets, these games! It couldn'twait? Do you realize the affront? Sit down. My child, your mother and l always protected you all. You've had no illnesses. You're grown, in good health. So many children die senselessly. Accident, hunger, an epidemic. Life is precious! Growing old is a privilege. Don't deny itto yourself. Don't deny us that. I know, Father. I don'twantto die. So I beg of you, for the lasttime, tell me what happened tonight. I already did. We were only playing. He's innocent. He drew her, photographed her. I asked for the photograph. He painted her. From every angle, since childhood. That proves nothing. Julien is an artist. You see evil everywhere. Enough, Madeleine. This is too serious. Your behavior induces them to sin. You must act. Marry Marguerite off no matter what. Before it's too late. It won't be easy now. - Philippe. - Leave us. Madeleine, Jean... Marguerite and Julien are sick. If we don't help them, they'll rot in hell. So will we. Marguerite isn'tjoining us? No. I'm yours. I must leave. No. I have to. Don't leave me. We mustn't meet again. Ever. Please. No. Don't leave me. No. Don't go. I'll always love you. Always. That night, Madame de Ravalet heard something. She went to Marguerite's room, woke her, shook her, made her speak. Marguerite resisted. No, Madame! No! Madame de Ravalet hit her as hard she could... and killed her. Howterrible. It's nottrue. I know what happened after. Marguerite began to cry and cry. Her mother cried with her. For a long while. There was no changing it. Like a disease. Her mother consoled her in her arms. Marguerite spoke, confessed everything. Her mother listened, terrified. She made her swear to stop everything. Did she swear? Yes, she swore. But it wasn't enough. Marguerite was forced to wed Mr. Lefebvre, a simple tax collector, very rich, the only one who'd still have her. I'm here. I see you. I win. Again. Another round? I'm tired. I'll go to sleep. Good night. "I'll go to bed. I'm tired. A little tired." See you tomorrow. "My Julien, I am a prisoner here in Valognes. "Theytryto separate us but can't. "We are blood and vein, "tree and sap, salt and sea. "Julien, my brother. "I have something awful to say. "I think I hate life. "I want to die. "I suffocate. "Every day is torture. "Only you keep me alive, "the hope of seeing you again. "Julien, I love you so. "Impossible to live without you. "I just want to see you, hold you. "How I'd give myself to you, if I could. "Take me away and do with me as you wish. I am forever yours, my love." "My sister, I must speak to you or I'll die. "I'm sorry I left you in this hateful situation. "I know now that fate guides me, not desire. "I've tried to comprehend our hurt, "to examine it. "My prayers make heaven weary. "I sought solace in wisdom and knowledge "to no avail. "That night was a conflagration, "an illumination. The harder I struggle, the more I love you." "Do not rouse their suspicion. "Take no risks. Be docile. "Acceptwhat they say. Do like me: Pretend. "What matters most "is to stay alive, for we shall meet. That day will be a blessing." "l do as you say, act pleasantly with my husband. "My life here is gloomy. "I am in a vise. "I refuse his advances. "I live in fear, "fearthat he comes near. "His gaze sullies me. "I despise him. His mother is so mean." "My sister, "your strength overwhelms me. "I feel helpless. "I am beside you. I'll save you from hell." Even burnt, his letters stay with me. When I die, they will. "I'll keep writing. Wherever you are, I will find you." You should be more wary. Marguerite and Julien loved each other. Lefebvre languished. His unrequited desire grew and grew and grew. He started seeing loose women. Soon enough, rumor had it his wife refused him in bed. Local laughingstock. Even his mother mocked. You're too sentimental. Idiot. Romance with your brother is not freedom. What a disaster ifword got out. I'm allowed. I can write my brother. Despite the fear, the loneliness, Marguerite survived thanks to his letters. She waited for him. Wishing. This small link between them kept her alive. Jacqueline! Grab her! And then? What happened? Where's Jacqueline? I want Jacqueline. A letterfor you. Not opening it? Read it! Louder! I can't hear. "Dear daughter, I write to you with a heavy heart. "Your husband told us what you've done. "Jacqueline, your accomplice "has been fired. "You know we love you. "We're proud of you, "but the days of child's play are over. "You're not a little girl anymore. "We have no choice now. "Marguerite, "I've made a grave decision. From now on..." "You'll never see yourfamily. "You'll miss us, and we you, "but you belong to another man "whom you must honor. "I askthat you devote yourself to him "and to the children you give him. "They'll bring you joy, as you brought to us, "your mother and me. Tend to your sorrowthus." Take me away. Speak to her. No luck tonight. Too much has happened. The situation is ridiculous. I have an idea. I'll go awayfor a few days. I'll leave you two alone. Maybe itwill relax her. Itwill relax you too. Ace of hearts. It's a sign. Hello, I'm here for the chimney. Come in. You usually come in May. This time, it's today. - Here it is. - Verywell. - Rooms upstairs? - Yes. With chimneys, I suppose? Yes. Lots ofwork. Miss Marguerite. Miss Marguerite. In here! Fear not. Julien sent me. Here. For you. Good luck. Thank you. "I'll free you at midnight. Get yourself ready." Go on. Stay here on the lookout. Enough of your arrogance. You're no princess! Take some dresses! It's me. Julien! She's mine! Run! This way. Putthis on. Hurry, go! Good luck. Do you regret it? No. Neither do l. I saw him, ma'am. Itwas him in the bed. They are doomed. Wake up. Get up. Wake up. Come. He'll lead you to safety. We must go alone. I love you. My children... Be careful. You're mad! I made the decision alone knowing you'd oppose it. Lefebvre will drop charges if she goes back. His lawyer is coming now. What do we do? We'll lie. We saywe sent her away because he mistreated her. And Julien? No contact in months. Whereabouts unknown. It's beyond us now. Lefebvre, furious, following his lawyer's advice, maintains his charges against Marguerite and Julien. He gathers testimonies, goes to the chateau, and presents his findings to the police. They're nowwanted. A reward is promised to anyone who helps. "ON THE RUN" Marguerite and Julien are nowfugitives. Sought everywhere. Their only chance of escape is to make itto England by boat. Yes? If we got married, I would be yourwife and your sister. And you'd be... The father of my children but also their uncle. And you, their aunt. Brothers, sisters, and first cousins. Butwe're not married. What are we? Something that doesn't exist. So all's well. We risk nothing if we don't exist. What are you thinking? About Mother and Father and the chateau. In England, we'll change our names. We'll startfrom scratch. Unknown to all. Like everyone else. We'll never be free. Everything normal. - Even in England. - Motherwill visit. Everyone happy. Our love is a curse. I'm sorry for having offended you, all good, all kind, and you don't like sin. Forgive me by the blood of Jesus Christ, my savior. Forgive me, God. Forgive us. We have to go. We have to leave. We must get to the sea. Come in. Yes? We found two people who look like them. Where? Barfleur. I'll alert the police myself. England. Water. You look decrepit. I think I'm pregnant. I found a wayto England. Tomorrow at dawn. We'll go outthe back door. All right? Can you make the crossing? Yes. Tomorrow. We leave tomorrow. It's daybreak. The boat's this way. Something's wrong. We have to split up. Go back to bed at the inn. I'll meet you after. Go back! Run! Go on! No! No! No! No! No! They'd changed identities. Marguerite was dressed as man. The Saint-Lo police arrested them. How are they? In good health. They haven't said a word. Since the arrest, not a word. Can I see them? No. That's impossible. What can we do? Nothing. I beg of you, Uncle. Help us. We must save the children. It's gone too far now. Your children broke the law. They can't take that back. Your connections can help. Look at this situation. In 10, 100, 1,000 years, incest is, and will remain, a crime. Only God can save them. I'll trythe impossible. I'll go to the king! Jean! See Villeroy, Secretary of State. Tell him I sent you. Do you admitto the crime Mr. Lefebvre accuses you of? No. Mr. Lefebvre is a liar. He mistreated my sister. So you won't admit to it? No. He won't confess. Submit them to lnquest. You mean torture. She couldn't bear it. It's a boy. I love you, Julien. Release my brother. I'm the one to blame. Free him. My husband beat me. He wanted to kill me. He saw loose women. How long were you at home? A few days. Why did you leave Tourlaville? Forfear my husband would come for me. You left alone? Yes. Really? Yes. Mrs. Lefebvre, you haven't seen your husband in 11 months. That's right. And you just gave birth to a son. Yes. Who is the father, since it can't be your husband? I don't know. The cat. Mr. de Villeroy! Mr. de Ravalet from Tourlaville, here for an audience. Come closer. Stand, sir. Tell me what grieves you. I will remedy it if I can. Alas, Sire, my children will be executed unless you showthem clemency. What is this about? All of Europe says the French Court is a whorehouse. I'm called a heretic with my mistresses and bastards. How can the Royal Body suddenly condone incest? Sir... I cannot before God forgive this crime. It is too grave. Show in the defendants! Marguerite and Julien de Ravalet are condemned to die at the stake for the following crimes: Adultery, incest, aiding and abetting treason. But given your class, His Majesty our king, in his extreme kindness, has commuted your sentence to beheading. Only I should die! I'm the guilty one! My brother is innocent! It's all myfault! Release my brother! Please release him! - The condemned? - Come. Always. Again. Always. She's dead. Sir. She named him Julien. Let's go. "We two, how long were we fool'd? "Nowtransmuted, "we swiftly escape, as Nature. "We are Nature. "Long have we been absent, but now we return. "We become plants, leaves, foliage, "roots, bark. "We are bedded in the ground. "We are rocks. "We are oaks. "We grow side by side. "We are two fishes swimming in the sea together. "We are what the locust blossoms are, "dropping scents. "Also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals. "We are two resplendent suns "in balance, orbic, stellar. "We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods. "We spring. "We are seas mingling, "cheerful waves rolling over each other, "interwetting each other. "We are what the atmosphere is, transparent... - "Receptive... - "Pervious... "lmpervious. - "We are snow... - "Rain... - "Cold... - "Darkness. "We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again. "The only place we two have. "We have voided all "but freedom, and all but our joy." "Marguerite and Julien de Ravalet" "died on December 2, 1603." "Theywere buried in Saint-Julien en Gr?ve" "with the following epitaph:" "'Here lie the brother and sister." "'You who pass by, ask not why they died." "Walk on and pray for their souls."'
