- I knew it! - We all passed! We made it! - You see? - Here! - What are you doing? - Come on. Hurrah! The school closed. The custodian happily says goodbye. Milena blushes. Flunked, another year lost. How wonderful that summer is back. The streets are crowded. What do these books want? Let's hurry! We're going to the sea. Goodbye, school. See you next year. Goodbye, teachers, and goodbye to you too. Why are you crying? Don't think about it. Latin can wait. Not the sea. Summer is here. Forget about studying. Pack your beach bag. You're already thinking of the September exam? I so much want to love. Love never says no. Goodbye, school. See you next year. Goodbye, teachers. Milena is leaving with me. Why are you crying? Don't think about it. Latin can wait. But not summer. The sea is here. Forget about studying. Pack your beach bag. You're already thinking about the September exam? I so much want to love. Love never says no. Goodbye, school. I'll see you next year. Goodbye, teachers. Milena is leaving with me. Kids, wait! Wait! - Be quiet! - Are you listening? Kids! We solemnly swear that next year, on the first day of lessons, we'll come to celebrate our absence from the school desks. - Are you with me? - Yes! So let's go! What will you do next year? Mom wants to sign me up for Literature, but I... You don't like it? Choose another School. No, the School has nothing to do with it. I was used to the potato chips I bought outside school. They sell popcorn and potato chips at the university too. I don't care about potato chips. I've never liked them! I ate them because you ate them, to have something in common with you. Tonight everyone at the party at Giorgio's house! - Alright. - Everyone at your house. Bye - Are you coming too? - No, I... I've an appointment with Stéfanie of Monaco. - Don't joke! - Who's joking? I didn't go last time. If I don't go this time, the whole principality will be upset with me. Are you coming to Giorgio's party? Hurry, Beatrice. It's late! - You're going with her to the party? - I always go where she goes. - I go where you go. - And Stéfanie of Monaco? We'll leave her in Monaco. She'll keep on waiting. - Alright, Nino. See you tonight. - Bye! - Nice body! - Are you always such an idiot? - I was talking about the car. - What about the blond one? He's been trying for her a long time. You didn't know? Yes, but forget her. She belongs to a special breed. - Meaning? - Luxury animals. The billionaires. They live in packs and mate among themselves. - You know what breed you are? - What you thought. - Alright. You understood. - Bravo! - Shall I have you dance? - I don't like you. - Of course. I'm your brother. - I don't like you, anyway. - But you like Nino, don't you? - Yes, very much! Did you know that you're cute? - I didn't feel like dancing. - So much the better. - May I ask you a personal question? - Is it an X-rated question? I'm curious. Why do you always go out with Beatrice? We are friends, close friends. And I care for her. - Why are you upset with her? - I'm not upset with her. But she's always there, and I can never see you. - How kind of you! - You don't understand. She is big. She gets in front, and I can't see you. Listen, Anna. Do you want to go out with me tomorrow? It's not possible. I'm leaving tomorrow. - I'm going to Taormina. - You found out I'm going and you'll go too. - What are you saying? - I'm going to Taormina. - Me too, every year. Really? Strange. I've never seen you. - Where do you stay? - In that hotel... - The one called "Capo..." - Capotaormina? - Right. - Who lives at Capotaormina? - Him. - Fantastic! - It's an incredible gift. - I can't see you. She gets in front! - We'll always be together! - Is it true she's coming too? - If not, I'll get pissed off. - Of course she's coming. - Is she coming? - I will be your shadow. I'm glad. It seems like a dream to me, Nino! - We must go. It's late. - You're right. - Then I'll see you. Bye! - Bye, Nino. - Marco, are you coming? - Go on. I'm coming on my own. - Just a minute. - Excuse me. I'll be right back. I have a villa in Taormina, but I prefer the hotel. - I'm going to Capotaormina too. - Fantastic! - Casanova, you tried again. - You were dumped this time too. - As usual. - Another two minutes and she would've fallen in my arms! - He is nice, intelligent. - But he says a lot of bullshit. - In fact. Jerks. How much do you want to bet that in a month she's mine? - A million, right away. - A million? Calm down! I can bet 100,000 liras that I'll steal from my mother. One million, one hundred. This is not a bet. This is a theft! - What if he does it? - Oh, come on! - Hi. - Hi. Listen, Nino. How can we know if we won, if we are here? You must trust me. - What if you trick us? - I would never do that! - But there is another solution. - What? - Come with me to Taormina. - Perfect! - Let's go to the Taormina camping. - My gosh! Calm down. - That step has been there 20 years. - I forget it. I have a small problem. My parents don't give me any money! Let's not worry. I am the only son of a rich father. Not for me, but do something for this poor devil. Alright, no problem. Is two million enough? - Let's make it two and a half. - Three, and I'll bring the tent. - Perfect. When will we leave? - Tomorrow morning. We're going to the sea... - Stop. I forgot... - The money? - My toothbrush. - Fuck off! Under the sea sun. Suntanned at the sea. On, two, three. - What the hell... - Wake up! - You want me to get a heart attack? - You're the usual sleepy head. At a certain point I ran after him, grabbed him, and said, "What do you want from me?" "What did I do to you?" He replied, "Who do you think you are? I won't even answer you." So I got pissed off. What would you have done in my place? Darn you! What are you doing? Sleeping? Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Let's go to the sea. Under the sea sun. - A clearing for the tent. - That way. Thank you. Go ahead. Suntanned inside the discotheque at night. A pearl necklace sparkles on your skin. This is it. This 16 hour trip went by in a second! Lucio, stop complaining! Just think, we finished school and are free. Air and women! - What've I got to do with women? - Don't argue. Go on! Get the stuff to set up the tent. - You're not helping us? - Me? I am here for Anna. - What did you put in your head? - Give me a hand! I am going to sleep in the hotel, at my uncle's. - You're always in the middle! - Close it. Go, don't worry. We'll set it up here. - Don't disappear! Come visit us. - I won't. I'll always be here. I'll only sleep in the hotel. Tonight I'd like to find a plate of spaghetti with clams. - With clams? - Yes. Fuck off! He even wants it with clams! Let's go to the sea. The two of us at the sea. Everyone is the same at the sea. You pee in the sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. I'm sorry! This time we can't give you room 214. It's reserved for Mr. Tocci for the whole year. Too bad! It is the only room for getting a tan nude. - How long are you staying? - Seven days. - Only a week? - Then we can please her. I will try to do so. But if Mr. Tocci comes, you must leave the room. - Are you with the lady? - No. - Then why did you intervene? - That's the way I am. - I see. Looking for someone? - Gennaro Ascolese, the director. - Hi, Uncle! - I was expecting you this morning. - Did you reserve the room? - What room? Stay with us in the personnel's quarters. It's no big thing, but... In the personnel's quarters? Let's get room 214. - That one is reserved! - It will be free in one week. - If you do this, you'd better leave! - Alright, the personnel's quarters. - He is my nephew, Ronca. - Nino Ronca! There are three calls. Beatrice called. She'll call later. Tell her I'm "incognita" and ask where I can find her. - The word is "incognito". - Alright, but 214 was better. What sort of director are you? Hurry! It takes you a half hour to set up two poles! Darn it! How far have you gotten? No, Lucio! What are you doing? - The male goes with the female. - What did I do? Male against male! Are you gay by chance? Continue. Darn it! Hurry up! Start setting up the canvas. Here. Here. The canvas goes in the front. What is the matter? A backache. I can't breathe. - Easy! Try to straighten up. - Terrible! Hi. What happened to you? Do you feel sick? Come with me. - Who will help me? - I'll be right there. Now sit down and it will go away. Come. Sit here. Hold still and don't move. I'll go help your friend. - What is your name? - Pippo. What a funny name! Here. - I'll put this here. - Yes, miss. This, here. Where should I put these? - You know where they go? - Let's put them there. Alright. You take this. This other one... Keep this, too. That way we'll figure it out. Why is all the stuff in your hands? We're setting up the tent. I'm sorry, but he is incognito. He asks were he can find you. We'll see him at Wunderbar. At ten, tomorrow morning. Thank you. Good-day. Incognito? He's says we'll meet in Taormina and comes incognito. - What are you mumbling? - Did you hear the latest? Nino is in Capotaormina incognito. - Why incognito? - I don't know. It's what they said at the reception. They knew nothing else. It's the way the nouveau riche behave. - Don't bother with it. - We're meeting tomorrow at the cafe. Good for you. Never give up. - Who is the appointment with? - What do you care? I gave it to someone I like. - If Anna comes, I'll come too. - You are crazy! Remember that Nino doesn't want to see you. Imagine if he'll see you. He'll get a heart attack. I told you to advise me before jumping in! - "Great distance lenses..." - Four and three is seven. "Others of small focal distance must be connected to a support..." Seven and two is nine. "The combination of the lenses..." - Eight and three is ten. - Eight and three is ten? - Eight and three is ten! - You even get pissed off? - I didn't get a card! - Play, cheater. - Are you looking? - Hi I was looking at the sea. A lovely day. I'll get undressed and go for a swim. Are you coming? - Yes, miss. - I'll be waiting for you. Now that it's the right moment, I can't regulate it! I say "hey"! What is happening to you? You want to see the naked girl? It's easy! You're becoming crazy with those lenses. It's very easy. Look. This is a mirror. I'll go there, signal you, and you look at the mirror with binoculars. Archimedes' principle of reflection. Yes, go on! Come. You'll tell me when she gets undressed. Hurry! Nino, give me a sign! Hurry! Shall I go? Go! Darn it, what shitheads! - You have a nice ass. - I know. Mom always said it, and was proud. She showed everyone. - Hi, guys! - Hi. - Hi, Anna. - Hi. Finally! We called four times in the hotel. - Sorry. I was... - Incognito. Good girl. I had to do that or my friends would look for me. - I want to dedicate my time to you. - What an honor! Really? Anna and I are happy that you came. - It's nothing. - What will you have? - It's on me. For me... a whiskey. - Alright. - What will you have? - We had something. - We had an ice-cream. - She ate it. - I just tasted it. - You don't eat to keep thin. - When did you arrive? - Three days ago. And you? - Last night on a plane. - Lucky you! - I got off... at Taormina. - Yes, with a parachute! You always drink this stuff early in the morning? Early in the morning? Three or four a day. They make you feel good all day long. Maybe you should have had a glass of milk. Go be obnoxious somewhere else. - Let's go to the beach. - Goodbye. - Every year the same things! - You will never change. You say you'll come, and then you disappear. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. - To the Alcantara Gorges. - I wouldn't have dressed like this. Don't worry. They'll give us boots. We'll walk in water. - Have you ever been there? - Yes, when I was little. - Finish your drink so we can go. - No, it's hot. I'll drink later. - Salvatore, on our bill! Come on. - Yes, let's go. Come, fatso. We look like Laurel &amp; Hardy! Stop it. I can't stand it anymore! I give up. You go. Did you hurt yourself? Thank you. Did you see how marvelous it is here? There are more beautiful things. - For example? - For example... - You. - Me? - Thanks. You're making me blush. - You blush for so little? You don't even know what I want to tell you. - What? - For example... - What I feel. - What do you feel? - Beatrice's voice calling us. - Let's go. Darn it! She always calls at the wrong moment! - Don't you ever come to the beach? - I've a lot to study... Even in summer? Take off those glasses. You have beautiful eyes! - The better to see you! - You can always see me. I am here. The moment will come when I'll see you naked! If I have lens one coincide with lens two when the humidity in the air... - Hi! - Hi! - What is it? - I need your help. - I am busy. - But you're sleeping! - Right. Let me sleep! - Help me, please. - Listen. - The formula for Coulomb’s law? D-I-C-K. - That spells "dick"! - You got it? Don't bust it. I want to go out with Anna and must get rid of Beatrice! - What've I got to do with it? - You don't know? You have to court her and keep her away from me. The bet didn't entail that. What bet? Did I ever get money from you? Not this time. If I win, we'll split it. - Alright. - Come on. How can I get close to that girl if in one year I didn't tell her one love word? I'll write what you must say to her. - Lucio, listen... - It's still D-I-C-K. Enough! - Anthony and Cleopatra. - Dante and Beatrice. - Lancelot and Genevieve. - Paolo and Francesca. - Renzo and Lucia. - Romeo and Juliet. - Nino and Anna. - Who are they? Two kids that I know. He is madly in love with her. For him, she is the night, day, evening. She is his whole life. The dream of every night. - For her? - I don't know. I know him. But she does nothing to convey her feelings. - He doesn't have the courage to ask. - What are you telling me? - That I love you! - Repeat that. - What? - I love you. You love me? We love each other! The perfume of this hair, I have always known it. The caress of these hands, I have always imagined it. When at night in my dreams you came to caress me, I woke up every morning with the need to kiss you. Finally you're in my arms, my darling. And I no longer suffer for love and jealousy. Until yesterday it was just madness. But tonight it isn't a dream, it is reality. Finally you kissed me, my darling. And there is another illness in this heart. I tell you now that you are my whole life, and I won't leave you for all eternity. Finally you kissed me, my darling, and in this heart there is another illness. Now I tell you that you are my whole life, and I won't leave you for all eternity. - It's so nice here. - Hi! - Hi, Beatrice. - Nino said you wanted to see me. - Why are you in Taormina? - I accompanied Pippo. - He's here too? - Sure! He's going to a convention for the study of contact lenses. He wants to study the... He wants to study the... He wants to study the life through binoculars. - He only sees it with binoculars! - What are you saying? My business! Please, sit down. - I ordered for you, too. - Thank you. I'll have half a glass of water. I'm on a diet. - There's still some water there. - What did you want to tell me? Listen, how do you say? How do you say... I wanted to say... "I am sure that..." How do you say it? I am sure that... I am sure that in my life there is only you. Wait. You had me come to translate this sentence? Don't get conceited! You think I can't say it in English? You made a mistake! - Understand? - You were a dunce at school. So don't insist. This is how you say it. Want to bet? That's where you're wrong! Because you say... I always had you copy my tests and now you correct me? It's useless to stay here and talk. You always want to win. What matters is having seen you. That way you'll be out of... - Out of? - Out of what? - You said "out of". - I said that? It must have slipped. Sometimes I start sentences and can't remember how they end. Enough small talk. I'll pay the bill and we'll take a walk. Waiter! I'm paying the bill because I'm at home in Taormina. I would never allow a woman to pay. - This time it's on me. - We are school companions. - So today I'm paying. - We've been friends for a long time. But I'm paying! How much is it? - 38,200. - You pay. Let's go to the sea. The two of us at the sea. Under the sea sun. Suntanned at the sea. Rows of umbrellas that shelter from the sun. Loud radios, all playing the same song. Let's go to the sea. The two of us at the sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Sea, sea, sea, sea, sea. Let's go to the sea. Under the sea sun. The faces you make at the sea. Making love at the sea. Suntanned in the discotheque at night. A pearl necklace sparkles on your skin. Let's go to the sea. The two of us at the sea. Yes? Really? What? Of course only you exist. Yes. Don't be silly, Nino. You know I love you. I can't now! I said I can't! Shall I send it? Thank you. Send me a kiss right now. Darn! Some have everything, some have nothing. Does it bother you that she's going steady with Nino? - Yes. - Then you are even. Nothing to you, nothing to her. - What do you mean? - He is making fun of her. - She fell for it like an idiot. - How do you know? I heard it. At the diploma party he made a bet with two friends. One million, 100,000 liras that he'd go to bed with her. It can't be! It's true. Will you tell her or will I? Hi! My love. - Sit down. - No. I can tell you what I have to say standing up! - What is it? What did I do? - You really don't know? If you don't tell me, how should I know? Are you getting the money from your friends now or later? - What money? - The bet money. - You won it. - Wait. - Who told you this? - It doesn't matter. Is it true? Listen... It's a very complicated matter. - If you have a moment of patience... - Is it true or not? It's true, but it was a joke. Then have a big laugh, but by yourself. Goodbye. - Wait! - Excuse me. The lady left. Are you leaving too? Who's paying for the bill? You are really unpleasant. Here, the change... give it to me. I swear, I don't know anything. I didn't tell her anything! Not even that nincompoop Pippo! He is lost in his problems. No way! - Who did it? - I don't know. One thing is sure. She treated me like worm and swore she doesn't want to see me again. I have an idea! You know what I'll do? I'll call her. I'll set up an appointment and fix up the situation. Trust me. Hello. Anna, is it you? Are you Beatrice? Hi, love! How are you? Hurry! Are you making love on the phone? Be quiet! I have to cuddle her. Tell me, Beatrice. Anna isn't there? I understand. Too bad. Of course. Sure, with great pleasure! Yes. I'll bring Nino! He will surely come. Alright. See you tomorrow. Thanks. - Bye. See you tomorrow. - What did she say? She invited us on Giorgio's yacht tomorrow. Don't worry. Everything will work out. Trust me! - Hi. - Hi. Love, where is Anna? Anna went with Marco to buy drinks and pizza. - They'll be here soon. - I see. Did you hear? Anna is coming. She went with Marco to buy pizza and beer. Perk up. You look like you're dead! Don't worry. Anna is coming, and everything will work out. Don't worry! You know what I'll do? - I'm going to Beatrice. - Good for you. - What do you say? - Good for you. Your same sentence? "I am sure that..." - Are you sure? - I am sure. - Then go. - I'm beginning to like that girl. Pretty, pleasant, fragile, as slender as a little bird. - Slender? Beatrice? - Yes. - Go on! You're blind. - I'll try. Is it cold enough? Excuse me. Can you come a minute? - I must tell you something. - Excuse me. Come. Come down. Don't worry. I won't hurt you. Listen, Beatrice. I must tell you something. But... Listen. I am sure that... Yes. You see? I am sure that... - You're starting again? - I just begun! Do you read anything in my eyes? Let's not waste time. They're coming with pizzas and drinks. We have to go out at sea and swim! Got that? How did she not read anything in my eyes? And yet something is written there. What a walk! - I'm really tired. - You're right. - We're coming! - We're coming. Let's go to the sea. The two of us at the sea. Under the sea sun. Tanned at the sea. Here, pizza and orange juice. We waited in line! Look at the muscles. Touch here. The result of karate. - You're cuter with mussed up hair. - Relax. Anna is doing it on purpose. Don't be an idiot! - Are you serious? - Yes! Lucio! Come help me, please. - Listen. - Yes. What are you doing here by yourself? I looked for you everywhere. I even thought you'd jumped into the sea! Are you seasick? I see. You have a stomach-ache. Did you see how Anna behaved with that jerk Marco? Don't get upset over it! What are you thinking? Move! Marco is no trouble. It's fake. Do you think Anna could go with that jerk? I think you used the wrong tactic. You should... Now you tell me how I should behave with women. This time, yes. You must go to her and slap her. She'll fall into your arms. I saw it in a movie. John Travolta did it! Woman in your arms. - I'll do as you say. - Go on. - I'm going. - Go! Certainly. - Why me? - You're worse than John Travolta. Alright. What a day! I can't wait to dive in the water. There's a nice sun. - What is it? - It's something important. Listen. I am sure that... I am sure that if you try me, you'll never leave me. - I am sick of you! - Holy Mary! So much water! - I'll show her! - Hi. - Hi. - Nino? Don't mention him! Don't mention him! - What happened? - He left. I fell from the boat and had to come on foot all the way here. - Why? What else happened? - What happened? - They argued. - Then we won the bet. - Get orange juices. We'll celebrate. - Where should I go? You're crazy. My shoes are full of feet! Lola turned on the camper. Tonight I'll see her naked. Lucky you! I feel dead. Darn! She put on her coat tonight. Her coat? At the sea? Let me see. A coat at the sea? Either you're an idiot or she is. - Yes, a coat! - Let me see! - A coat? - Yes, a coat. She's all naked! Great tits, a back like a Greek statue. - She's a knockout! - You see her naked? - She isn't dressed. - Let me see. What a shithead! She has a coat, shoes and a scarf! You're a shithead! Go have a checkup because your brain has gone berserk! Just when all the data coincided! I told you Anna was here. - Get rid of him. - I'll try! Let's hope so. Marco, excuse me. Come a minute. Come. Us, just the two of us, close together at the same table. An ice cold beer, cold like us. Two bites, a sandwich. Waiter friend, don't be an idiot. Go away. Us, just the two of us talking, but not saying anything. Love is calling us, and we're not answering. The bill is here. Will you lend me 1,000 lira? Will you lend me something to say? Popcorn and potato chips to remind us of what you were and what you no longer want to be. You, my little girl, bread, love and freedom. Me, with my silly dream of happiness. Popcorn and potato chips to remind us when you ran down the stairs to embrace me. Us, just the two of us, close together at the same table. I slightly touch your hand in getting a glass. You look at me, I look at you. Our thoughts meet. Tonight we'll make peace. Us, just the two of us, more alone than those who don't have love. We're wasting this time and it's getting late. What a silly argument, and we don't realize that without the two of us we'll get lost. Popcorn and potato chips to remind us of what you were and what you no longer want to be. You, my little girl, bread, love and freedom. Me, with my silly dream of happiness. Popcorn and potato chips to remind us of when you ran down the stairs to embrace me. Popcorn and potato chips to remind us of what you were and what you no longer want to be. You, my little girl, bread, love and freedom. Me, with my silly dream of happiness. - How did it go? - Awful. Marco said there's Anna's birthday party tomorrow. - Shall we go? - You go. I'm not coming. As you wish. I'm going. Come on. Maybe when Anna sees you she'll have second thoughts. I said I'd accompany you, but I won't go up. Pippo, are you coming? I can't tonight. Everything works. I can't miss this opportunity. - Watch out for your emotions! - Alright. - Have fun and say hello to Anna. - Bye. Revise Coulomb! - Hi. - Hi. What happened to you? I waited for you after the noon swim and the six o'clock one. - Are you spying on me? I would never dare. It's just a matter of calculation. - What? I don't understand. - I'll explain. If I manage to combine the right light, at the right moment and right place... - Tell me. Do you get cold easily? - What are you saying? - Why do you cover up? - Should I go around naked? - Of course not! I wish! - What? If people see you going around naked, they'll wonder why. - Wouldn't you like that? - Who? Me? Thank you. You're welcome. Hi. How are you? - Thank you. - Hi, Anna. Happy birthday. You're waiting for someone, right? Good evening. - Hi. - Hi. Happy birthday. Thanks, but it's not my birthday. It's Anna's birthday. Yes, I know. But I came for you. - Thank you. - Happy birthday. It could hurt. Hi, Anna. - Hi. - Happy birthday. Thank you. - Listen... - Listen... - Speak up! - No, you speak. You're the guest. But if you must tell me something... - Speak up! - Where is Nino? Nino didn't come. Why? Because you didn't invite him. Yes, maybe you're right, I didn't invite him. "Why didn't Nino come?" What the hell do I know? They argue, and then take it out on me! Come, guys. The cake is here! Come on! - Happy birthday! - Blow them out! - Good girl! - Happy birthday! Thank you. - Thank you. - Let's eat the cake. - Go on, cut it. - Can you cut it, please? Wait! Let's cut it together. We'll do a dress rehearsal. - Come on! - The bride is the most beautiful. The beach is still the same. The sea is the same blue. Nothing has changed. Just some extra memories. You with your diary. In the pages you always wrote about us. Cinema Arena. "Flashdance" was our movie. Now I don't sleep at night. I return to this beach with a very sweet thought that is only an illusion. And in the echo of the sea, I see a faraway dream again. You with me, hand in hand. I repeat "I love you". During the loveliest scene of this invented dream, I find myself in reality and I see you again far, far away, without me. The beach is still the same. The sea is the same blue. There's even the umbrella where you used to sleep. You with your diary. In the pages you always wrote about us, about our love. And this beach was our bed. Now I don't sleep at night. I return to this beach with a very sweet thought that is just an illusion. And in the echo of the sea I see a faraway dream again. You with me, hand in hand. And I repeat, "I love you". During the loveliest scene of this invented dream, I find myself in reality, and I see you again far, far, away, without me. Hi. Why aren't you saying anything? What should I say? Why didn't you come to the party? It's my birthday and you didn't even wish me a happy birthday. For that matter, I even got you a gift. - What do they mean to you? - The two of us. What is it? Did you make another bet? Please, Anna! I did something stupid, I agree. But I never lied to you. Never! Not even once. Watch out, Nino. Don't lie to me anymore. I wouldn't ever forgive you. Then you've forgiven me. I am happy! Happy! I love you. I love you! I am happy too. I would like this summer to never end. Everything ends, sooner or later. At times, even love. Not for me. It's the truth. You must believe me! We're not the only ones to decide, when money is involved. - What's money have to do with it? - It does. It is an ugly disease. It always ends up ruining things. You mean that... If I were poor, you wouldn't want me? - Are you? - Me? No! It was just a way of saying. What would you do, if you found out I was poor? We aren't here to talk about that. What matters is that we love each other. That is what matters. Clarity is what matters in life. Swear you'll always tell me everything. It's important for me. Will you promise? Of course I promise. - Lola! - Hi. You're very elegant! I came to pick you up to go to town. Thank you. Will you accompany me to Mass? Sure. We could go to dinner and a discotheque later. Wait. I'll ask Mom for permission. - Your mom? - Mom! - He is my friend Pippo. - Good evening. - Let's go, Pippo. - Darn it! Then my calculations were right. I had the wrong woman. Beatrice, it's the third. Don't tell Mom. Don't be a squealer. Let's go to the sea. Under the sea sun. Too bad! I'd give 20 kilos to be in Anna's place. You're crazy to give away 20 kilos. I like you the way you are. What is so interesting about Nino? Everything that you don't have, darling. But I'll have to make do. You are all imbeciles, and I'm sick of you. Enough of this Nino! - Beatrice has been waiting 2 hours. - I'll be right there. Nino, I have to go home with Beatrice and pack. - So you've decided. - I'll see you before I leave. - Of course. - Bye. Let's go! I'll accompany you. - Hello. - Good morning. It's nice to see you, Mr. Ferretti. How can I help you? I'd like information on one of your guests. - The name is Nino Ronca. - Nino Ronca? - Impossible. I don't believe it! - That is so. You can check. He lives in the hotel basement like a beggar. He says he's incognito to have people believe he has lots of money. He doesn't have one lira, and lives off of his friends. He led us to believe he was rich, but he has nothing. Nino fooled everyone. Including you and Anna. - He's an imposter! - Thank you for the information. - Wait. Where are you going? - I'll fix things up my way. But... You jealous imbecile! Don't be so nosy! - It's a swindle. It's the truth! - Get lost! Hello! Hotel Capotaormina? Yes. I will give the message. Just a moment. He's coming. Yes, he's here. - It's for you. - For me? - Who is it? - Hi, it's Beatrice. I can't explain now, but Anna is coming to see you. Do something! - Anna is coming here? - My brother caused a mess. You'll explain later. I have to think now. - Yes. Bye. - Thanks. Finally I was able to have the optic equilibrium coincide with the focal length, through habituation , and you take me away? Please, you're going crazy over those lenses! Listen. You must help me. Alright? I'll repeat it again. Anna is going to the hotel. If she finds out I lied to her, it will be the end! - Indeed! - Idiot. I stole the key to room number 214. - Really? - Pippo, wait for me in the lobby. - When Anna arrives, send her to me. - The bet? - I don't like doing these things. - I risk losing her forever! Let's not argue over such nonsense and not cause messes. We'll help you. What should I do? - Don't cause trouble. - Shit! - You'll come with me. - Alright. - Understand? - Yes. - Understand? Don't sleep! - Don't sleep. Wake up! - I understood! - We'll settle accounts later. Scoundrel! - What are you doing? - Waiting! - You know what you should do? - No. Have only Anna come in the room. - When she comes, I'll accompany her. - Yes. No, you stay here! - What should I do here? - Talk to the cleaning people. Cleaning people! I'll go over there! - Are you looking for Nino? - Do you know where he is? Room 214, second floor. - Are you making a fool of me? - Why? Go up and you'll see. You're here, too! I'm waiting for Anna. My gosh, you're Anna! Come on. I'll accompany you. I was dazed. You must go there, in that room. - Hi, Anna! - Don't talk. - I know everything. - What? What is enough to realize what your love for me is made of. I don't know what they told you, but I love you. - You are everything for me. - I'm not falling for it anymore! - It's the truth. - I don't believe you. - I swear on Holy Mary. - I don't believe it. - You don't believe in Mary? - I don't believe you. Our respects, Mrs. Tocci. Pleased to see you. - Is my husband here? - Not yet. You want the key? - Yes. Isn't is there? - Yes. Then get it! Get it! - It's not there. I don't understand. - You don't understand? Are you hiding something from me? - Please. It is not our custom. - Not yours, but my husband's! - My husband's! - Wait. Don't jump to conclusions. You thought that money was the most important thing for me, and you presented yourself not as you are. But in life what matters is the courage to be what we are. You can be proud of your riches, and of your poverty. You've never had that courage. So you know what? Forget me, and forget ever having known me! Forget that I exist. Is that clear? Scoundrel! Cheater! - Stop, madam! Where're you going? - It's my business. Move! - What? - There's a woman inside, huh? - Yes. What do you care? - What do I care? - My gosh! - Now we'll see! - A low blow! - Where are you? Where... Very well! Where are you? Where are you? Now you go with minors? Shame on you! You slut! Go to hell! You even have me insulted? - Madam, calm down. - Go away and leave me alone! Come outside! I know you're in there. Open! - Calm down. - Open this door. - As you wish. - Open! - Who are you? - I am a jerk in love. Is anyone here? The doorbell. - Is anyone here? - They went out. They left a mess as usual. If I hadn't known Beatrice since she was born, I'd have left. - What's Beatrice have to do with it? - She is the owner. Beatrice is the owner of the villa? Isn't it Anna? No, it's Beatrice. - Is the gray car hers, too? - Yes. You didn't know? I complicated things like an idiot. Let's go. - Goodbye. - Thank you. Goodbye. Bravo. Keep it up, and you'll stay with us. You'll see. Please. - Sit down. - Hi, Nino. Beatrice, finally! I've been waiting for days. I didn't know where to find you. I hoped you would come here. We had some small differences for the house, the furniture... - Right, love? - You really wanted to see me? Help me find Anna. - Why do you want to see her? - She is indispensable to me. - Are you sincere this time? - Yes, I swear on my life! I believe you. This is Anna's phone number. Don't tell her I gave it to you. - Here's the token. - Thanks! What a nice, fat face! I did as you wanted. Can we go? You go ahead, love. I'll stay just a bit. I'll join you. I'll eat something. Waiter! - Hello? - It's Nino. Is Anna there? Anna isn't here, and doesn't want to talk to anyone. Don't call again. Is that clear? Anna isn't there. Her mother said she won't talk to anyone. Come here, don't worry. It's ok. I'll give you her address. Wait for her outside the house. All this is free. You're my best friend, after all. Even if I'm about to become rich. Go on! Handsome guy! I like you because you're handsome! Yes, handsome, but must you slap me? I'll pay a boxer to slug you and he'll knock you out! - Hi. - Hi. - What do you want? - I wanted to talk to you. - Speak up. - Not here. Let's go in my car. - What do you want to say? - I apologize. Even if I was wrong, I wanted to say that I told all those lies... because I was afraid of losing you. - I'd like to believe you. - I swear, you must believe me. - Then you must know something. - What? - I'm expecting a baby. - What did you say? I'm expecting a baby. Did you change your mind? It's marvelous! A child of our own! Now I love you even more! A child that belongs to the two of us! Stop honking! She is pregnant and you honk your horn? You should play bells! It's a celebration! Let's go. - Let's find shelter over here. - Yes. Put on this sweater and get close to me. The sun is rising, but it's cold. A storm is approaching but luckily this beach cabin can shelter us. You are still cold and your sweater is not enough. Put on mine and you won't catch a cold. Now we need some warm milk. But this place is deserted without a soul around. I can see you running in the rooms making food for the baby who is crying and wants to eat. A small home, me returning from work. A bed, three pillows, and he'll fall asleep between us. Don't worry about your parents. As the days go by, all bad things will go away. They will become grandparents and everything will work out. You'll see that star shine. You'll see, you'll see. You'll see that's how it will be. He'll get his first tooth whispering "Daddy". And in nine months, when the baby is born, a stork will be outside our house. Meanwhile, don't be afraid. Go up the stairs with the elevator. Heavy breathing can be bad for you. I can see you run around the rooms making food for the baby who is crying because he wants to eat. A small house, me returning from work A bed, three pillows, and he'll fall asleep between us. Don't worry about your parents. As the days go by, all bad things will go away. They will become grandparents and everything will work out. You'll see that star shine. You'll see, you'll see. You'll see that's how it will be. He'll get his first tooth whispering "Daddy". A stone each looking at the circles in the water. Some moonlight in this summer sky. And while a star falls, we have the same thought. Our hands lightly touch. What a desire to do wrong. Away with the blouse and that blue scarf. Slip off those jeans. I can't stand it anymore.
