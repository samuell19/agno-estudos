You are very far from home. You are in a cold and desolate place. I am the only soul on Earth who knows you are here. You are completely off-grid. No phones or Internet. All you have is what's in your front pocket. This is my hunting cabin and you, Ava Bravo, are about to be hunted. Five miles directly north of this cabin, you'll find a lean-to. Inside is a shiny snowmobile, gassed up, ready to go. It's your only way off this mountain. You reach that snowmobile before I get to you. It's game over for me. You escape to civilization and I am left stranded to die in the woods. As an elite sportsman, I insist on true challenge. So, I'll be hunting you with limited ammunition. My rifle holds three bullets and those three bullets are the only ammunition in my possession. I get three chances to take you down. That's it. Use this to your advantage. Strategize, Ava Bravo. Two pieces of advice. First, don't just run off in a straight line. Second, if you're ransacking the cabin right now looking for a weapon, you are wasting precious time. There is nothing here that you could possibly weaponize. All you can do is start running. Because right now, Ava Bravo, I'm down in the basement. And I'm about to come up. 10 Mississippi... 9 Mississippi... 8 Mississippi... 7 Mississippi... 6 Mississippi... 5... Ah. Son of a bitch. Five miles directly north of this cabin, you'll find a lean-to. Inside is a shiny snowmobile. What the fuck is this? Fucking crazy man. I'm a survivor, here, now and forever. I'm one with the Creator. I found it. There it is. Ah! Son of a bitch! Psych. Fucking traps. Son of a bitch! Where am I? There's nothing. There's nothing here. The son of a bitch brought me here. And the son of a bitch will take me back. There it is. You can do it, you can do it. Come on. Don't worry, he's tied up. Everything will be fine. Fuck! What'd you shoot out there? Figured you'd be hungry. More for me. Don't move! Well, here we are, Ava B. You are the first guest to ever outsmart and outpower me. Where am I? Did my spikes get you at all? - Where am I? - Hmm. No snowmobile out there, huh? Yeah, "psych." Hmm. Give me your phone. What phone? Give me your phone now. Didn't you listen? You have a fucking phone! You searched me and the cabin after you knocked my ass out, right? Did you find a phone? Okay. You tricked me with your little footprints in the snow. Then you whacked me, you dragged my fat ass down the stairs. You avoid the trap. You do all that. But then you cuff my hands in front of me. I mean, in the front. Kind of a dumb-ass mistake. How about que te meto este pinche rifle por el culo? Mm-mm, mm-mm. English, por favor. 'Cause this essentially makes me a one-armed man. One armed-man can still do a lot of damage. You know, I had an actual one-armed man up here last winter. And he did great. Well, until he didn't. Where am I? Huh? Tell me how to get out of here or I'm gonna fucking kill you. Nah. If you had killing in you, you would have done it at the start. You don't know what I have in me. At some point up that mountain, you realized you need me to survive. Sit down. Let's not forget that. Sit down! No problemo, I say. You know, I had a tough choice to make, too. I could've hidden. And bushwhacked you when you came back. I could've choked ya with these chains, but instead... I thought it would be nice to talk. Have a little meal. You know. Sorry, that it's just beans and water. Well, I'm not interested. A Mexican who doesn't want beans. - That's a first. - Fuck you. So, what'd you shoot up there? Really, 'cause sound... sound travels from miles up here so I knew that you were still with us. Hmm? What was it? Okay. Doesn't matter. What does matter... is that you have now squandered... one precious round. You should just be careful that you don't waste another shot. How about I waste a shot right in your fucking face? Well, if you don't think you need me to get out. Maybe, I just kill you and live in this lovely cabin forever, hmm? Yeah, it is a nice escape. Gets a little lonely though. But you know all about loneliness. Ava, I truly don't know what is gonna happen next between us. And I just find that so exhilarating. What's that? Fire off a couple of shots for a test. Ha, ha, ha, ha. It's a bird. Hey, birds fly into buildings sometimes. Because they make dumb-ass mistakes, too. Comin' up on 18 months now, huh? And you haven't aged a day. You look great. You all have something in common. - Yeah, you hunt survivors. - Yes. - Real brave, fucking asshole. - You know, if anybody other than you were doing this, they'd be in a rubber room right now. No, you need to shut up. Here's what's gonna happen. - Hey, you're amazing. - You have to shut up. - I had this war hero up here. - Here's what... No, no, no. I'm gonna do something even worse. I need to know how I got here! There are no roads. First, there was a snowmobile. Then a little sled. Where is it? The snowmobile. Come on, I'm not gonna answer that. Maybe you wanna rethink that answer. If I die, you die. - Oh, what is it? - Don't... What? I don't know. I swear to God. - Shoot him. - What? Shoot him now. Shoot him! - What the fuck is happening? - In here. Where are you going? Where are you? Get into the light, so I can see you. Do what I say when I say it. Or I'm gonna open the door. - Bullshit. - Come on. I have nothing to lose. Okay, asshole. Okay, stop, stop! Okay. You win. Back up. Against the wall, now! I was just trying to help. Who is it up there? How the hell should I know, huh? Some backwoods hillbilly. Will you just shoot him? Fuck. Just shoot him. There's nothing here. - What is this? - A tranquilizer. - This is useless. - Just shoot the fucker! You look trapped, huh? Well, fucking improvise something. I plan, I don't improvise. Of course. Because you never had to. Look, will you just shoot him? What the fuck are you doing? That door's not gonna hold forever. What is it? Hey! Hey! Help! Stop! Just shoot the fucker! Shoot him! If I die, you die! You fucking kill him. No, no, no. No. Come on! You have one left. Give me that fucking glove. You impress me at every turn. Take me to the snowmobile. Who was that, huh? Now, you shut up. Oh, God! Fuck. Keep moving. We gotta deal with this leg. I don't care about it. Look, I'm not gonna make it to the snowmobile, alright? Alright, the bleeding's not gonna stop from all the fucking walking. Fuck you and fuck your leg. Come on! Do it. I'd rather go quick than sit here and bleed out. Go on, pull it. That's what I thought. That big bastard's gonna wake up any second. And he's gonna see our very obvious tracks and he's gonna be looking for revenge. That was a dumb-ass decision you made not to finish him off. Dumbass. We're gonna move a lot faster if... if I'm not coming apart at the seams, right? I got a first-aid kit and it's right in the backpack. Fuck. Fuck, fuck. Fuck! You want me to sit down? Face down on your stomach on to your arms. Do it! Oh, okay. This is smart. Yeah. - Don't move. - Oh, that fucking hurts. Pretty ironic, huh? You saving me. I'm saving me. Yeah, here, pour a little of that tequila on the wound and then a little into my mug right here. Just a little taste for the pain. Shut up. I guess I'll be fine. Don't move. I know who you are. You're that guy at the barbecue king. King's Castle Barbecue, yeah. Buddy King. It's nice to, uh, meet you. You have like a hundred restaurants. 155 restaurants around the world. Your restaurant, it's people, isn't it, the barbecue? No, I don't serve human flesh in my restaurants. I'm an elite sportsman, not a cannibal. Well, I did eat that one guy. That was a long time ago, it was really... It was really more of a bucket list kinda thing. - Shut up! - Ow! Done. - Don't move. - Yeah. Don't move! All right, stand up. How did you get me here? Tell me the truth. Like I said, first on a snowmobile and a sled the rest of the way. - Before that. - You mean... From my home. I spent a couple of months learning your routine. You wake up, you put on workout clothes, you grab a few bites of granola, you hop on your fancy spinning bike, you go take a shower. Then you get dressed. Sometimes, you don't get dressed. You work from home, you cook for yourself, you watch TV at night. How did you get me here? You rarely leave your house at night. The occasional, unpredictable night-out with your girlfriends. Or when you take your garbage out. Sunday nights, 9:05. In your purple robe. Then in the middle of the night, I went into your bedroom, gave you a shot. A shot of what? Fentanyl and heroin. That tranquilizer from the basement? Why did you undress me? Ow, oh. Get up! Take me to the fucking snowmobile. Right now. Sure. Don't forget the bag. Oh. Hey. What is this? I keep seeing them. No idea. You want to freeze or you wanna walk? I do a lot of research so I can learn everything I can about my guests that come here. Guests? Yeah, you've told me. That creeping around where I live, looking in my windows. Observation is a part of that research, of course. But so is television, and newspaper, and the Internet, and... and I read everything that was written about what happened to you. But you never did one interview. - And I never will. - Why? I mean... look, there's something terrible happened to you, right? And people wanna know how you got out of it. I'm not a victim. Walk, fucking asshole. I mean how did you get out of that hopeless hole? Huh? Just give me a taste. Stop trying to psychoanalyze me, okay? Just fucking walk. You ready to share yet? It doesn't have to be about Albuquerque, okay? Even though I'm dying to hear. Look, it could be anything. Keep moving. Huh, man, you're tough. Okay, I'll start, ask me anything. I'm an open book, go ahead. Oh. It's understandable. You have issues socializing, so I'll be you. "Buddy... how'd you start a world-famous barbecue?" Great question, A.B. Rudy's Bar-B-Q, just outside of San Antonio. Leon Springs, Texas. You ever been there? My father took me on a three-week road trip. And that was actually the first time I met him. It was when he stole me from my mom the day we left. He didn't even know my name. So, he would just say... "You getting hungry, buddy?" Or... "You feeling tired, buddy?" Anyway, so they go to Rudy's and the kid eats all the cream corn and then the next night, before they're leaving, the kid's begging the father if they can go back to Rudy's. And he says, "Buddy, we can't go to the same place twice." Oh, the kid starts crying and he goes over, he hugs the father, and he looks up at him, and he says... "Please, Dad." And that was the first and the only time, he ever called him "dad". So, you got daddy issues? - What, you... - Hey! What, are you trying to psychoanalyze me now? Huh? It's not much further. Let's go. - Hey, no stopping. - Shh, shh, shh. What? It's probably wolves. Buddy! Buddy! What are you waiting for? Let's go. Asshole. Ava. Oh. Fuck you! You're an asshole! You're an idiot! Come on! One more time! Woah, woah, woah, woah. Ava. Ava. Hey. I don't want you to die at the bottom of that pit. And you don't want that. I mean you don't wanna freeze and starve at the bottom of a pit. Motherfucker. You have hands-down... been the best I've ever had up here. I mean, most of the time, it's barely a challenge. That's why I came up with the three bullet rule, you know? But you... You, Ava, you keep it interesting all on your own. Ava. I gotta go take care of something. The way I see it, you have two choices right now. You can die at the bottom of that pit or... when I come back, I'll help you out of there. And we can finish the game. The way that it's supposed to be. Hey, hey, B... Buddy. I'll be back. Hey, no, no, no. Buddy, don't leave me here. Buddy! Buddy. Come on, where are you? Oh, shit. Well, shit. The way it's supposed to be. Ava. Don't touch her! You, Ava Bravo are about to be hunted. Don't touch her! You're wasting your precious time. Don't leave me! I'm a survivor, here, now and forever. I'm one with the Creator. I am made in the image and likeness of the Creator. I'm a survivor, here, now and forever. I'm one with the Creator. I am made in the image and likeness of the Creator. God, give me strength, please. You didn't let yourself to be beaten. I won't be beaten. - Miss me? - Psych. Mmm. You wanted a little taste, right? Look how survived a year in that hell house. I did it the same way I'm gonna survive you. No crazy ninja skills, no magic tricks. I just wait for men who think they are so strong so smart, so scary, to make dumb-ass mistakes. Dumbass. That's no story. You don't deserve my story. Here's what we're gonna do, I find it really hard to believe that your snowmobile is this far away. Yeah, well, I usually don't have to hike it with a hole in my leg or at gun point. It's not that far, trust me. If I don't see that fucking snowmobile in one hour, you are gonna see this one bullet. Because I trust me way more than I trust you. If you don't believe me... fucking try me. One hour. It's that way. Move it. - Ava... - Shut up. - Look, I just wan... - Shut up. I'm sick of your bullshit. That thing you had to go to take care of when I was in your pit, what was it? I thought I supposed to shut up? As if that were possible. It was nothing. Huh? It wasn't the soldier? The one you brought up here to kill, but obviously didn't. Not very elite. Seems like a dumb-ass mistake. Yeah, well, he's dead now. - Dead? - Dead. - You sure? - Sure. 'Cause you keep looking over your shoulder. Wouldn't be the first time you thought you killed him. This would be twice now. You failed. What? What's the matter? Don't you like to be fucked up? You know, I figured something out about your story, you know. You've killed before. Right? Maybe you didn't mean it. That felt bad. Or maybe you did and that felt better. But I'm guessing, you got a little blood on your hands from all that. Am I right? Is that what you think? Well, that's why you cry yourself to sleep every night. Is that how you got out of Albuquerque? Help! Help me! - Over here! - Shut up! - Help! - No! I'm up here! - Help! - No! No! Hey, she's got a gun, she's got a gun. - Woah, lady, hey, hey. - Woah, wait, wait. - She's crazy. - Listen to me guys. Woah, woah, woah, lady. - Please, help me. - Hey, I've been kidnapped. Oh, I... I need your help. Please, don't listen to him. Look at me. Look at me, look at what she did. Hey, no, no, no. Please wait. Get down! Get the fuck down! Okay, I'm sorry. Don't hit me again, don't hit me again. Okay, look. Look at what she's done. - He's lying. - I'm really sorry. - That is not true. - Okay, I'm sorry. Listen to me, he's lying. He kidnapped me, he tried to kill me. I need help. Listen, hey, my name is Buddy King. Alright, I own a bunch of barbecue restaurants. I do TV commercials. Buddy King. - You're Buddy King? - That's right, nice to meet you. He's Buddy King. From TV. - The commercials, yes. - Barbecue Castle. - Nice to meet you, yeah. - Yes. That's right King's Castle Barbecue. And she's trying to kill me. You're speaking in Spanish. You speak Spanish, right? Can you get me out of here in that thing? I need you listen to me. This guy has kidnapped me. Don't listen to him. He tried to kill me. He's a hunter. Hey, hey, she's loco, she's loco. What she's saying? Do not trust her. Do not trust her, guys. - Please, help me. - Don't believe her. Wait. Buddy King is a people hunter? Yes, he tried to kill me. He's lying. Look, wait, she... listen to me, listen. She's an animal rights activist, okay? And she's probably not too happy that you guys have been killing animals. No, don't listen to him. Call the police. If I was the bad one here, I wouldn't ask you that, right? - Please. - I can't. No signal. Just for music. - Music. - Okay. Okay, um... Okay. Hands down. I won't hurt you. No, no. What's she saying? Get me out of here in that thing. No, don't put your hands down. No, do not trust her. Don't trust her. I'll give you this gun. Point it at him. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, no, no. I'll give you this gun. Point it at him. - Okay? - No, no, don't take... Look at me, look at me, don't take the gun. - No, no, no, here. - Yes. Careful with that asshole. - Look. Guys, just look. - Don't move. - Look... Just look at me. - What do we do? Look, look right here. Get in the snowmobile. Let's go. Just look at the back of my head. Can you see that? Look at my lip, look right here. Burger King is a people hunter? ♪ Hey. Get away from him. Get away from him, he's innocent! Buddy, please don't do anything. Buddy, please don't do it. No, no, no, no. Don't... no! Fucking asshole. Huh, looks like you're still gonna need mine. What now? Are you gonna break my neck now that I can't move? You fucking animal! There we go, there we go. Right here, right here. - Right here. - Away from me! Get up. Oh. Hey, I'm a step closer. But I do have this fucked-up leg. Game on, Ava? Your call. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, it's close. It was close. But play time's over. Hey, yeah. Alright, this is what we're gonna do. First, get all my shit in my bag, will you? Damn. Here you go, good job. Good job. Come on, come on. Great. Thank you very much. My knife is in there. Yeah. Yeah. You never hand a knife to somebody with the blade towards them. You always offer the handle first, so flip that around. Hey, throw me my bag now. Right, you know what's next, right? Just fucking do it. Shoot me. Your story. Albuquerque, Ava, I just... Look, my snowmobile is right over that ridge. You're almost there. Hey, sit at the edge of the fucking snowmobile. Go ahead, right there. We got it. There you go, sit down and look at me, now. Let me see you, look at me. Okay, Albuquerque. He came down the stairs... No, no, you don't start a story in the middle. I want the whole thing, beginning, middle, and end. I want the tell-all. But you didn't tell me your whole story. If you want my story, the whole thing, then it's only fair you do the same, right? You'll say the whole story? Yep. Deal, deal. Okay, where was I? You went back to Rudy's... Right, right, right. - Then what? - The police came. And they asked me if... the man who stole me from my mother's was my real father. And I actually didn't know so, I... I shrugged. My father reached for his ID and they shot him. That was it. Okay. The end. That was boring as shit, but it was a nice appetizer. Now for the main course. The whole story. I was at my mailbox when a delivery van pulled up. Mmm, he hopped out of the van and said, "Good timing." Then slid the side door open. "Your package is in here somewhere." I had to reach up for it. And in one second... someone grabbed me and pulled me inside. Next thing I remember, I was waking up in the basement. It was hot down there. Dark, no windows. When he'd come down uh, to either bring food or... rape me... he opened the door at the top of the stairs, and for one second, this... bright light from above shined down. Ah. Oh, but then, he'd lock the door behind him and came down. Hmm. One time, he didn't lock the door. He just went to get something from the other corner of the basement and the bright light just lit up the stairs. I thought I could get out. So, I ran. And I got out. What, that's it? I told you, there were no fancy tricks, no ninja skills. He made a dumb-ass mistake. What happened? He... He brought down... he brought down a young girl. She was only 17. She was... She was beautiful, kind, smart... and scared. It... It didn't matter what he did to me. Just... Just it didn't matter. It was listening to him doing that to her. Her crying. Her screaming. I knew I had to get us out of there. I felt so responsible for her. I had to get her out of there. So, the day he left the door open... and the light just shone down, I yelled. "Run!" And we ran. I made it out of the house. She didn't. I hear her screams every day. We both killed someone we didn't want to. We're the same. Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Alright, I respect that you tried that. I appreciate you telling me your story. I feel really connected to you right now. I don't know. I don't wanna sound corny, but... I do wish the day could go on forever. But all things come to an end, so... Let's go. What? It's only fair you get to see the finish line. It's the way it's supposed to be. Go on. You'll appreciate this. I can't believe it. I knew it, I knew it. - Ava, listen. - I knew I couldn't believe you. You motherfucker. You son of a bitch. Hey, things might not be as dark as they seem right now. All this? This whole journey? You... You were fucking stalling for time until you could kill me. All your talk about fair play, your rules, your fucking snowmobile. They were all fucking lies. They were all fucking lies! - I'm not going in there again. - Ava, stop. Fuck you! Fucking asshole! Fuck you! No, no, you were never gonna let me go. You just want me to walk you circles to play your fucking little game. Okay, you just shut up for a minute and listen. I admit, yes. This whole time I have been stalling. So, I can get the upper hand. Okay, that just took a little time. - Okay? - Fuck you. Right, something happened out there and I've had to be smarter, and quicker, and craftier than I have been in years. Yeah, well, good for you, imbecile. We... hey, will you just hear me out? We both got our baggage, right? And it just made us both a... a couple of fucked up loners, right? Just stacks the deck against us. We had an interesting start, right? And I don't know if we could ever trust each other. I mean, I don't even know if that's possible. I... but what I do know... is that we don't have to be alone anymore. All gassed up. Ready to go. Son of a bitch! Was it here all the time? All this fucking time? We both deserve a nice escape. And I am not talking about my cabin. I got a lot of money. We can go anywhere we want. Anywhere you want. So, I've decided to let you decide. You can stay here with me or you can jump on that snowmobile. Ride on out of here. I won't come for you, honest to God. Your choice. Well, that stings. You really think that I can just let you drive out of here and leave, huh? I'd never be free of you. What... How the fuck are you still alive? Are you gonna kill me with my mug? Shit. No, with your knife. Hey, Buddy... we're not the same. I win, you lose. Game over.
