Oh, damn! They're with me. - Anything else? - Axone. Call her again. - Yeah, Minam. - Yes? Why did you leave so early? I had to go to church. Are you okay? Just focus on the interview, okay? Yes. Minam, we'll handle everything for the evening. Rock the interview, Minam! Hurry up! Lift your feet & dance away. Sing a melody, make the heart sway. Joy & woe are woven fine. So, go ahead & spread some smiles. Those lovely days & nights I remember those... Those... Those... lovely days & nights. "I remember those." I remember those meetings. Those lovely days & nights... Hey! Stop, stop! Stop! Who is that? Granny, he's my cousin. Cousin or convict, I don't care. No boys are allowed after six in the evening. Yes, but he's just arrived, Granny. This rooster sneaks out in the morning before anyone can wake up, and you say he's your cousin? The bugger can't even keep his eyes open! Granny, I swear he's my cousin. Yes, Granny. I'm her cousin. Oh, my! Now, who is this? Good morning, Granny. Oh, God! Why do you guys lie so much? Now, listen to me carefully! I don't want to see any boys in this house from today! Hey! Where are you running off? Stand right there, and listen to me! You mongrels! Hurry up, Ma. Let's go! Oh, God! Tell me, why did you wake up late? You wake up late, and then, you make me hurry. You'll fall down. Be careful. We are going to be late. - Yeah? - Everyone has left. - Go, check with the other girl, please! - Okay. Okay. Give me this. - Tomatoes? - Yes, one kilo. It's Rs. 35 a kilo. - Pick out the good ones. - Yes, sure. One kilo? Don't worry. I'll give you the good ones. - You want the big ones? - No. No? Okay. Give me one kilo tomatoes. - Have your tea. - Look at that hot chick! Add two more. These girls have a tight booty! I can do her all night. - Do you have the stamina? - You know, their moans are so sexy! What did you just say? What happened? - You just said something. What was it? - What happened? - What did you just say? - I didn't say anything. - You did. - No, I didn't. No, you just... - What were you saying? - Nothing. I was sitting quietly. What happened, dear? Uncle, this guy was being vulgar with me. Hey! We didn't say a word. - What do you exactly mean by vulgar? - He said something dirty. She's just making up stories. It's nothing I am not making up stories. Ask him! He was right here. - I didn't hear anything. - Why are you lying? Ma'am, you're obstructing my business. Men say whatever they want. Just ignore them. He's saying he didn't hear anything. Then, ask him. He was right beside me. - She's crazy. Look, what... - Hey, don't call me crazy! - Hey! - How can you hit a girl? - Hey, back off! - She pushed me first! Or I would never touch a girl! - You boys seem to be from a good family. - She pushed us first! - She pushed us first! - Didn't you see that? - These people deserve it! - Just leave, please! She pushed us! Let's go, let's go. - Are you okay, dear? - You should just ignore such people. Just take her home, dear. He was standing right there. Listen! Bendang has left. Kapil's here. Just come! Don't be scared! I've taken her permission. We'll play a couple of rounds. Yes, come fast! What are they doing here? They always play outside, but today, they change their mind. Oh, God! I wonder why. Zorem knows Hyper, right? - Yes. - Tell him to talk to Hyper. But we've already taken so much help from him. I mean you know... Zorem doesn't like Minam. Hey, isn't he the landlord's son? What's his real name? You said you knew him! Besides, we just moved. Do you know the landlord's name? We call him "Uncle." - I hope you've got some money. - Oh, no! Come on! Give us your share. Go away. I don't want to buy anything. I've not come as a salesman. I'm your son's friend. I can't hear a word. Come in. - Which son? - Where's my share? The one who's always hyper. Take this. I forgot his name. What? You forgot his name? How strange! What a friend you are! You don't even know his name? What's going on? I've never seen you here before! Hey! How come you're here? Hey! Who is he? He's a friend. - Is he? - Yes. He doesn't even know your name. Dad, look where he's from! These guys can't speak Hindi! But why doesn't he know your name? He knows my name is Shiv! Look at him! He's given away his name. Uncle, he's my friend. He knows my name. In that case, tell me. What is his name? Come on, Dad! Are you playing poker or detective? - Forget all that. Tell us his name! - Yes, tell us. What's his name? His name is Danny. What is your name? - Of course, he'll say Danny now! - Oh, no! Do you think I am an idiot? - Stop trying to be Sherlock! Let's go! - Keep your plate in the kitchen! Spoiled brat! - Where were you? - Hey, come here! How can you have a wedding here? There's no place for dancing, or a cocktail bar. Come on! It's just us. How's that a wedding then? Shiv, we need to cook while your granny takes a nap and before the Bengali auntie gets back. We need to get done with our cooking. There's hardly any time, then! - What do we do? - Shiv, can you help us? On one condition. What is it? You guys must get me a Northeastern girlfriend! Sonu will be so jealous! What happened? I spoke to Puia and Jenjum. They also don't know where Bendang is. His phone... is not reachable. Let's go to Bendang's house. This is from me. And this is from me. - What's going on here? Tell me! - Keep playing! You've turned my daughter's house into a casino! - Mom, I had told you. - What are you talking about? Now, you're backing out. I had told you we were coming to play cards. - Yes. - You had agreed to it. - Then, why are you making a scene? - I had said only half an hour, - but you've been playing for hours! - This is the last round. My poor daughter toils away at work, while you sit here swatting flies all day with this bunch of graying cockroaches! Dyeing your hair won't reduce your age. You need to cool down, Mom. You toad! Get out of here. Sit, man. My daughter ruined her life the day she married this fraud! - My life hasn't been a party, either! - Hey, look at that picture. This man is sucking the life out of my last few days. Look! I'm warning you! If I curse you, you won't even find a place in hell! You'll spend your afterlife drifting in space. - Mark my words! - Fine, I'm leaving! - Get the hell out of here! - Calm down, I'm going. - Look at what they've done to my utensils! - I'm going to spike your tea! Useless househusband! Such an animal! Keeps playing all the time! - Come out, Shiv. They're gone. - All clear? How could you run away, coward! Just wait, okay? Chanbi, come out! Yeah, okay. Okay, bye. Bendang's house is locked. Where's the smoked pork? You put this later, right? We ran out of gas! What should we do now? Didn't you know about it? How would I know about it? You think I can look inside a cylinder to check if the gas is running low? You've lost your mind! It's Minam. - Everything is under control. - Yes. You guys are my guardian angels. You know that, right? Yeah, alright! I know that a cylinder doesn't last more than two months, and I don't even cook! Why don't you maintain a schedule? You know everything, so let me know the exact date and time. What do we do? It's not possible now. The cylinder is next to Granny's room and she's asleep. But there's a way. You know Gupta's sweet shop? His jalebis are famous. His sweets sell out in an hour. I went there yesterday... Yes! So, Gupta is my guy. He'll give us a cylinder. But the Bengali auntie can get here any minute! It's right here. It won't take us more than five minutes! Five minutes won't be enough! I swear on my mom! Not a second more than five minutes. - One of you just hop on my bike! - On your bike? I can't go alone! You should go. Why me? You should go. I'm not going! I'm not going on his bike. Ouch! I can't hold this! Put one hand on the cylinder and another on me. I'll fall down, idiot! - Tell her. - Hold it with your right hand. Then, how do I hold the bike? - With the left hand! - Then, how do I hold the cylinder? - Put it in front. - And put my feet on your head? - Oh, God! - Will you hurry up? I won't. I'll take the cylinder and go for a movie! - Okay, bye! - Oh, God! If you were a real Northeastern girl, I would have dated you. I am a real Northeastern girl, idiot! - Hey, don't get mad. - Shut up! Put it in my lap. - Hurry up! - Here! Ouch! - It's too heavy! - What happened? I can't hold it! Put one hand on the cylinder, and another on me. I'll fall down! - Oh, God! - Shiv, listen to me! - Slow down! - Why do you talk so much? Stop honking! Hey, slow down! If you were my girlfriend, I'd break the cylinder on my head. What are you doing? What's wrong? Who's this? She's a tenant. Why haven't I seen her before? She's new. She lives on the first floor. I had told you about her. What is she doing with you? What do you mean? You think we are out on a drive with this cylinder between us? This is your last warning. If I see you with another girl... You said... you didn't have a girlfriend? And you still want a Northeastern girlfriend? We're not serious. It's just for fun. We got the gas! We got the gas! Do you know what time it is? It's one o'clock! I've been through hell! Why didn't you pick up my call? Careful! How do I pick up the call? I was holding the bike with one hand and the cylinder with the other. I'm not the ten-handed Goddess Durga! - Don't fight, guys! - Hello, brother! Hi, dear. How are you? Careful! What do we do now? Don't worry, I'll sort it out. What will you tell her? These guys are new. They have no idea how much your food stinks! - What do you mean? - I don't have time to explain. It's falling down. Auntie, you just have to shut your doors and windows. So, the smell doesn't get in. Don't worry, the workers told me they'll finish cleaning in half an hour. They just need to repair the septic tank. - Oh! - Don't worry. - Okay? - Okay! - Do you have a hankie? - I have a purple one with flowers. - I won't smell the stink, right? - Not at all. Don't worry. What about Granny? She's fast asleep. And she can't do squat even if she wakes up. - Why? - Because I hid her walking stick! If you are free in the evening, please join us. Careful! Of course, I'll come. After all, I have to dance at the wedding. Oh, but we're from the bride's side! We'll have fun, no problem! She always calls me whenever I'm having a good time! Anyway, bye. See you later. Good, he's gone. You know, I can't stand him, and you invited him to the wedding? Move. - Why did you invite him? - Where's the axone? You say you're from Northeast. - Still, you can't tolerate its smell? - It's because we Nepalis don't make it. Is that enough? Why don't you make it if you're an expert? Hey, I'm saying because it's three kilos of pork. It's enough! It's going to stink anyway. It smells so bad. Hey... Chanbi. What's happened to the power? Where's my walking stick? Shiv! Where is it? Shiv! Someone, find out about the power! Ouch! Hey! Stop it! Stop cooking that stinky food! How did she find out? I'm going to die. You're killing me! Turn off the gas. Arrest them! Put it down there. No, put it inside. Let me come up there. I won't spare you. Come! Let's keep it in the fridge. It's very hot! It's very hot! - What should we do now? - Put it in your closet! - Why? - To hide it! I mean, why do we have to put it in my closet? Why not your closet? You're stinking up the neighborhood! It's nothing, Auntie. Wait for some time. They're repairing the septic tank. - I know what's going on inside! - What happened, Granny? My entire house is stinking like a gutter. I don't know what they've done! Come out! - Let me teach you a lesson! - What has happened here? Granny, you look like a sports girl today. Shut up, and help me! - Granny, we aren't cooking anything. - Oh, really? You think we're stupid? Do you think we can't smell anything? You can come and check. What's there to check? We know you guys are cooking that shitty food. Wait a minute! Let me handle this. When you rented this apartment, I had told you that you can't make... - Come on! Hurry up! - That stinky food here, didn't I? We haven't cooked anything, Auntie. - Shut up! - What happened, Granny? - Keep quiet! - Granny, he's the one who told us about the septic tank. How could you... I'm going to stuff you in that tank! Granny, listen to me. You do this to your own granny? Move aside. Who are you? Who the hell are you? - I... - Tell me! - I... - Why are you lying? You think we don't know what's smelling? You aren't even apologizing to Granny! Say sorry! We're sorry, Granny. We won't do it again. There's a wedding. So, we made some. Wedding? You mean, in my house? We've just invited a few friends. There will be no bloody wedding or party in my house! You heard her. No party! Granny... it's Minam's wedding today. - You should thank God... - Is this the time to check out clothes? - I'm letting you live here. - Zorem isn't picking up. You can't cook your food in this house from today! If you do, we'll throw you out of this neighborhood! Just like they did in Munirka. Oh! What had happened in Munirka, brother? They all had decided not to rent a place to these people! That's enough. They're just kids. She's bloody acting! - Someone check on her. Get some water. - What's wrong? - What happened to her? - Hey, her breathing is heavy. - Granny, I'm just giving her water. - Upasana, hurry up! Let me help her! Such drama! It's okay. Try again next year! I'm sure it went well. We don't need to cook right now. So, what's the plan? What are you staring at? India-China friends forever! How can I leave you like that? Come on, let's go. Where are we going? You should date Balamon instead. Move! We don't have all day! Come on, Shiv! You can do it! - Why did you bring this guy? - It's a matter of prestige now. What's going on here? Sorry. We've lost the key, so... Uncle, you don't need to worry. They are with me. - And who the hell are you? - Me? - Uncle, we are Bendang's friends. - Who's that? - Bendang, the guy who lives here. - Every day, I see a new face. Anyway, all of you look the same. So, how will I know who lives here? If we all look the same, how can you tell it's a new face every time? It's open. Let's go. I don't see the cocktail party happening here either. Oh, wow! This is where they rehearse. Where do we even start, dude? I was in the school band. Robin, hurry up! Why is it taking so long? Who is it? It's Bendang's girlfriend. Chanbi, what happened? What are you doing here? They threw me out, because I burst a balloon. You don't look well. Listen! Let's go see a doctor. - We need to find a place to cook first. - What? - A place to cook. - The doctor's right here. Come! Is he good? Good? He's the best in Delhi! But he's a child specialist! Deep inside, we are all children! Come on! She's asking how long do we have to wait? She's asking about time. How much time? I can speak English, okay? Who needs this when your patients are children? Kids don't take stress, but they love to give stress. Here, dear. Give me your hand. A little higher. Damn, I forgot my glasses! 150! Looks like hypertension. What you had earlier today was a panic attack. Yes. But don't worry. You'll be fine. It's not what it looks like. She is also a tenant. Oh, really? Every girl is your tenant, Shiv? They all live together. What can I do about it? I'm tired of your lies! I had to take her to the doctor. She just had a heart attack! Yes. Look at these pills. Please have these pills! The doctor has told you to have them, right? Have your medicine. Come on! Shiv, I am fed up of your antics. - Listen... - Shut up! You are always seen with different girls! You don't answer my calls! But you spend time with these girls! - Bunty called me for a game. - Is she Bunty? I had to help her. She is a friend... Why do you have to help everyone? - You don't have time for me! - Hey, where are you going? Please, go after her. Drive her around Delhi! - Baby, why don't you trust me? - Trust you? I just caught you with two girls! Baby, everyone's looking I don't care if everyone is looking at us! - Don't call me! - Listen! Baby, let's go for a coffee? Do you want some tea? No. Jassi, stop it. Why are you shouting at me? He threw my iPod! Stop it. Martha's just coming. Is the medicine helping? I feel better. - Hey! - Sorry, I was cooking. Did you find out? These things create a lot of tension between us and them. Now, whose right is more right? Tell me! But it's Minam's wedding. Did you tell them that you need to cook for the wedding? I'd told her we should tell them. Guys, you can lecture me all you want when I come tomorrow. But today, let's not waste time. There's one place, the community center. Talk to the secretary. Jassi will take you there. He knows the place. What? Come down. What is it? Come on, let's ask him! He was wondering if you can see the entire wall with those small eyes? Motherfucker! What did he say? Motherfucker. Shut up! - Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Motherfucker! - Shut your mouth! Get lost, both of you! What did you say? Don't you dare say that again, got it? You're the one who said that the axone is not important. You were the one who insisted we cook no matter what! Yes. - It's not like that. - Then? Hold on. What can we do? She's on the phone. Yeah. What happened? Chanbi went back. She got a call. Yes, I came to know that. I'm still here, standing outside the secretary's house. I haven't eaten yet. It's so hot. He's here. I'll call you back. Martha has sent me. She had called you before sometime. Who? Sunny's wife. Yes, sure. Dear, can you tell me what work it is? Remind me. It's nothing, sir. I... I'm sorry. I made a mistake. But you said someone had called me. Yes. Sorry, Uncle! It was a mistake. Yes, bye. He got some neighborhood kid to lock him in his room. He was inside the whole time. He didn't turn up. Didn't turn up? He just didn't come. So, what about axone? It's Minam. It's her wedding. - Don't you have a table fan? - No. I'm going. Finish it quickly. Oh, God! Yet another shameful incident from Delhi. Our exclusive footage shows how... Bendang Longkumer from Nagaland was brutally beaten up in the crowded Lajpat Nagar market until he became unconscious. Our sources say, he was picked on by some men at a dairy shop in Lajpat Nagar market, simply because he colored his hair blonde. When Bendang protested, you can see how they attacked him with hockey sticks and rods. Look how they are beating him mercilessly! We must warn you, these images are violent and disturbing. Bendang's life hangs by a thread in the hospital. What's going on here? How can I help you? - What's going on? - We're cooking. - You are cooking? - Yes. But we're the ones who have to cook. And what's this stench? You guys are early. We're on time! We're booked for three o'clock. Just give them half an hour, they'll leave. - Where's Ram Prasad? - He's not here. It's just a matter of half an hour. No, we can't do that. - You should talk to ma'am. - What's the matter? Auntie, they just need half an hour. Half an hour? The guests will come soon. - It's my grandson's first birthday. - Please, Auntie. Brother, half an hour turns into an hour when you start cooking. Our food is almost done. Where's Ram Prasad? Call him. He's coming. Is he your husband? Yes, why? He harassed me this morning in the market, and when I complained, he slapped me. Who are you? Why are you lying? I don't know her. - It was this guy? - Yes. You've forgotten me so soon? Who are you? Why are you spreading lies about my son? Do you know her? I don't know her... How dare you ask me! She's lying. So, now I'm a liar? Have you forgotten how you slapped me in the market? Ma'am, you're mistaken. I don't know you. Your husband assaults women. Please, just shut up! Let's go, please. I'm sure, he beats you as well. Don't you protest? That's enough or I'll slap you again! - Try it! - Hey! I know girls like you very well! All you girls have pimp-husbands! They send you here in skimpy clothes to ensnare our boys! Let's go outside! If my family wasn't here, I would have thrashed all of you. Quiet! You've embarrassed us enough. He must have learned it from you. Let's go. Please, leave. We need to start our cooking. - Tell me the story again. - Yes. A ship carrying hundreds of passengers sank on the high seas. Among the few who survived, was a woman. But all four of her daughters had drowned. She telegraphed her husband, who set sail at once. As his ship passed by the shipwreck, he was overwhelmed with grief. And as he tried to make sense of the loss of his beloved daughters he wrote a song. When peace like a river. Attendeth my way. When sorrows... Like sea billows roll. Whatever my lot... Thou hast taught me to say. It is well. It is well... With my soul. It is well... With my soul. It is well... With my soul. He controls you so much. It's not like that. We have problems, but who doesn't? You and Bendang have problems as well. Bendang doesn't control me. It's you who controls him! All the time! I don't! For you and Minam, career is important. For me, it's more important that I get married and settle down. Has Zorem ever said he will marry you? Zorem never says anything. Hey, look what you did! It's not like I did it on purpose! No! You do this every day. Don't you have any manners? I was watering my plants. What can I do if you walk by at that time? I know men like you who just sit in the house, while your wives go to work! Why don't you take some other route, then? I was going to my girlies' party. Now, I'm completely drenched. So, walk on the other side of the path. Why don't you push back your building! Oh, yes! Please, help me! Don't you worry about Dad! I'll handle him. I know how to butter him up. Dad, it's Minam's wedding and she lives here. How can Granny stop her from inviting her friends? Your granny didn't tell me anything about this. Tell you? She should have checked with you first! But Granny has never bothered to check with you, anyway. I get it. Danny, what are you cooking? Our special dish. Okay, go ahead. I'll handle the witch! She is not aware of what I can do! Why do we always fight like cats and dogs? We're always at each other's throats. - I don't know why... - I pick up a fight? Then, who else? Who helped you when you lost your job? - It must be you! - Yes, that's correct! I get that government officers can't survive without bribes, but you are the only one to get caught. You brought dishonor to our family! Yet, I let you squat in my house. - You're always yapping around! - Careful, Mom! Sit properly or you'll hurt yourself. - You scared me. - I am sorry. Now go for the other leg. Shall I go for your neck instead? - What did you say? - Nothing. Always yapping! I know they're tenants, but this is where they live. You won't even let the poor girl get married, and you scared the other one so much. She had a heart attack. Yes, heart attack! Shiv said he had to take her to our doctor. Panic attack, not heart attack. Ouch! That hurt! - No, I... - Do you want to break my bones? It's all knotted up. - What was that? - It's nothing. I'll go and check. Get some rest. You might get a cramp. - Leave! - I still have to do the other leg. - I'll come with you. - No, you'll sprain yourself. Very good! - I'll come. - No, stay here! Who's making noise? Who's making noise here? What is this? It's a gas cylinder. Idiot, I can see that! What's it doing here? We need to cook, right? And what about the one that's upstairs? Minam's already reached. It's a surprise. Hey! Where's my walking stick? It must be next to you. This can't go upstairs. How will we cook, then? If this thing explodes, it'll burn down my building! Then, you'll understand! It's Granny's building! - Where the hell are you? - Granny's bloody pet! - Did you hide my walking stick? - Why would I hide it? - Such a liar! - Take that old contraption. You father and son have made my life miserable! I'll tell my daughter everything. What old contraption? The one that we used before we switched to gas. Why would I hide your walking stick? Oh, that one! - Oh, God! I've fallen down. Help me! - We're doomed. Granny, what happened? - Did you fall again? - Such drama! Where did you keep your walking stick? You saw that? Will this work? - We don't have a choice. - I have to go. Granny's in pain. Yes? Are you sure? What's going on? We're cooking. On the roof? What are you doing? Same old household chores. Oh, okay. What are you cooking? Good! Are you going to a fancy-dress party? Look, look! Fashion parade at Granny's house! Is it Jackie Chan's birthday? Where are you going all decked up? Are we invited? What's the matter? Tell me! Why are you crowding here? You think it's some circus show? Go home everyone! Scoot! Come on! Move! This is beautiful, dude! I never thought this room would look so pretty, dude! - What do you mean? - Bendang and I are going back home. I'm so happy for you, dude! But how so suddenly? When did you decide? I had to respond to the email regarding the new job. I have made Bendang wait for so long. But, listen! What will you do there? I'll figure out something. It's been ten years in Delhi. You're leaving. Look what I have to do for love! Love is stupid -Love is stupid. - It's a twisted arrow. - It's a twisted arrow. - It knows no joy, knows no... - It knows no joy, knows no... Who invited Hyper? Ain't I killing it? I left the India-Sri Lanka cricket match for this. Of course! Who doesn't know this sneaky fellow! He slithers in every night like a snake and sneaks out at dawn before anyone can spot him. Bro, you must teach me your ways! Minam loves fairy lights. Look at it this way! Hi, sister! Are you okay? I'm fine. How was your exam? It was okay. - You look so beautiful! - Thank you, and so do you. Yes! Here, meet everyone. - Oh! Hi, Uncle! - Hi, Minam. Hi, Auntie! You look so beautiful, Minam. I wish you were here with us. How I wish I was there, too! I do! - Hey! - Hi, sister! You should be here instead of me. And say hi to everyone, please. Is it Minam's wedding, or her sister's? It's Minam's, but her sister is replacing her in the ceremony. What do you mean? To take someone's place. Hey, I understand English! I mean, how can you replace someone in a wedding? The wedding is taking place there, but it's Minam and Chimar who are getting married. - But why isn't Minam there? - Because her exam's going on. Do you see that old woman? That's Chimar's grandmother. She just had a heart attack. She may die any moment. Sure it wasn't a panic attack? So, is this how all of you get married? This happens only in Minam's tribe. An ancient ritual which is not practiced anymore. I badly need a drink. Your marriages are strange. How can the bride be replaced? And if the real wedding's there, shouldn't everyone be there? It makes no sense at all. It's complicated. By the way, what were you doing locked inside? Didn't you hear us? It was I who broke the lock. Did you have a girl with you? Bro, I also want a Northeastern girlfriend. But this is an emergency so... He called me a "fucking Indian." You guys don't think you are Indian? How sad is that, dude! I'm sorry, bro. Wow! Three wickets in 30 runs? Look at that handsome boy! Thank you. I guess, it's the hat. You still look good without the hat. Yet you are there, and I am here. I wish you were here with me. I miss you a lot. Lift your feet & dance away. Sing a melody, make the heart sway. Joy & woe are woven fine. So, go ahead & spread some smiles. Lift your feet & dance away. Sing a melody, make the heart sway. Joy & woe are woven fine. So, go ahead & spread some smiles. Lift your feet & dance away. Sing a melody, make the heart sway. Joy & woe are woven fine.
