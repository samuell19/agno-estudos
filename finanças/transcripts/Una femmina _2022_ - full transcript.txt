Based on true life stories. Dedicated to all the victims of the 'ndrangheta. To all rebel women. Here's what we do, daughter. I call our lawyer. You tell him where you are... he comes and gets you. We pay him, don't worry. So you'll be able to see... your daughter. You know she's not well? Do it for me, too. I'm devastated. You don't realize what this is all about. No, Cetta. You don't understand. They are using you. They are using you. No, you listen to me. If you don't call the lawyer... you can forget about us. About me. About your daughter. You have to chose. Pick a side. Either you stick with us... or with them. Understood, Cetta? Rosa? Ro'? It's Mommy. Are you hiding in there? Come on. Are you angry at me? Mommy's back. Where were you, Mom? Far away. Couldn't I come with you? No. It was an ugly place. You really changed your name? Who told you this nonsense? Somebody at school. Are grandma and uncle still angry at you? There are things I don't like. Like what? Lies. You mustn't tell lies. Do you lie? Secrets... are bad. They can harm you. Now let's do something nice. Close your eyes... Let's dream... of a beautiful place. What place? Somewhere faraway. Where we're alone, just you and I. Promise? Yes, I promise. Mommy? Mommy? Mom! Take the girl away! Rosa. Come, come. Mommy's not feeling well. Rosa, you scared me. You woke up? What's that? Hare. I'm cooking it nicely. Everything alright? I didn't sleep well. How come? Too much thinking... What are you thinking about? I don't even know... - Hi, auntie! - Hi, Ro'. Cousin! Cousin! Wanna go for a ride? Get to work, come on! Two apples. Add a few carrots. They look good. Here's a bundle. Here, this is for Mariuzza. Her medicines are in the bag. Six, seven... These are for the old town. Mrs. Giovanna? Oh, sweetheart! - I'm here. - Wait! Come upstairs. I'll pay you. Medicine, fruit. Ten euros will do. Yes, my darling. God bless you. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Thank you. I want to give you something nice. It's for good luck. I'll pray for you. Just kiss it, like this, then cross yourself. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Rosa, you're not eating? I'm not hungry. Eat some more. It's a shame. Natale will finish it. What do you think I am? Come on, Nata', stop it. You're so ugly! You can't make it! - Come on, stop. - Stop what? What do you say now? Come on. I can't breathe, honey. Sure, you can't breathe... How gross! - Let go of me! - Sure, let go of me... Remember when you pissed yourself? - Remember? - Nata', I swear I'll kill you. - Let's see if you did it again. - Get off me! Let's see. Don't dare do that again! I was joking. You've become touchy. I was looking for you. What are you doing here? We were just relaxing. What happened? Nothing. Nothing. Then hurry up. They're waiting for us. Rosa? Where are you? Ro'! Rosa! What are you looking at? Who is he? Leave him alone. He hated us. Go and get some fresh flowers. Hey, Gianni! Hey, Rosa! - Everything alright? - Sure. Do you want to come in? Come. - I need some flowers. - I'll get you some. What would you like? Whatever. Just flowers. For your grandma? As usual... What are you doing? I'm fixing that frame. - Do you like it? - Nice. You know everything, don't you? About what? About the dead. Well, it's my job. It was my father's job, too. They also keep you company. Some are better than people. They keep quiet. I enjoy the silence. I do too. Cheers! To the newlyweds! In one go! Go, Natale! I want a girl and I'll get myself one. I will cut my hair off. I will cut my hair off, place it under the blueberry, so she can pick it up when she comes by, so she can pick it up when she comes by. If you say she's not pretty If you say she's not pretty, you'll have to fight with me! If you say she's not pretty, you'll have to fight with me! Long live the newlyweds! Long live the newlyweds! You fool... Come here. They can see us. You drank too much... So what? What's the matter? Did you like the serenade? I did. Everyone was listening. Even Natale. It's just me and you now. Let's go. I've got sore feet. You danced too much. You did. You had fun tonight. Who are they, auntie? I don't know. Is it you? - Mrs. Rita. - What do you want? Just paying a visit. - Let's go home. - Why? Don't worry, Mrs. Rita. Natale, I told you to go home. Rosa! What are you doing here? - What do they want? - That's none of your business. Go home! - I'm not leaving my father alone. - I said, go home! Let's go, Nata'. Comare Berta! Let the kids in. Is it Ciccio? They have grown so much. Time flies. Too many things happened in these past years. Too many. Are you Cetta's daughter? What's your name? Rosa. Tore... Such a creature... Why do you hide her? I don't want her to get spoiled... I understand. Her mother had the devil inside. She doesn't talk much. I talk when it's necessary. Very good. Silence is golden. Am I right? Come on, Ciccio. We have more important matters. You're right. I just wanted to greet the whole family. Mother... - Nata', stop a second. - Leave me alone. - What are the Pacchiuni doing here? - I don't know! Yes you do! - What do you keep inside the barn? - It's not girl stuff! - Then it's not for you either! - What do you mean? - Come on. Stop it. - They are always after the money. They should have killed us all! - What is it, auntie? - Call Grandma. Natale made another mess! Natale. Natale, what's wrong? What is it? What's this blood? What happened? What have you done? What did you do? You're a beast. A curse on our family. Or maybe this house is cursed. Take the body away. Now. Rita? Come with me. Natale, get lost! Go away! It's alright. Come, I'll help you. Rosa? What's the matter? What's wrong? Rosa? Rosa? Rita? Rita! What is it? What happened? She's so cold. She's cold. I don't know. Go get a blanket. Rosa? Rosa? Rosa... Rosa? Rosa? She's cold. She's cold. Rosa? - When is he coming? - He'll be here soon. Can you hear me? It's auntie. Sit up, sweetheart. Give her these drops. Ten. Twice a day. Alright. The girl needs to rest. Drink, honey. What happened? She passed out just like that, here at home. You know that her mother had these crisis... Right. I remember. - This is for you, doctor. - Thank you. Thank you, Mimmo. I'll tell your uncle to go shopping. You need to eat something that gives you strength. You need to recover. Why did we leave? Leave what? That house. It was old. Falling apart. Were we still there when Mom came back? Why are you thinking of this? Go on. Tell me. You know. I already told you. I want to hear it again. Your mother killed herself. Do you understand that? Now finish eating and go lie down. The doctor said you need to rest. Here. What do you know about Natale? What should I know? I know as much as you do. What can we do? I don't know. Men are our disgrace. His father ruined him. He ruined all of us. You're right. What's Gianni doing here? He's helping Salvatore. Let's go. Get on. Who gave this to you? Just take it. Who cares where I got it? And the motorcycle? Did my uncle give it to you for his business? I've known Natale for ages. Who cares about Natale. You know who I'm talking about. Our grandfathers were in the same clan. Don't you know? Stay away from my family. Don't make such a fuss. There are things you really don't get. Or are you pretending you don't? You said it yourself, didn't you? What? That the dead don't talk. But my mother did. Everybody knows. So do you. I just want to know where she is. That's all. They didn't even write her name. It's good. Yes, it's tasty. Here you are... Add some water if it's too hot. Why did you disappear from town? I just went for a stroll. I needed some fresh air. A stroll? Where to? Why? What do you care? Do you want me to beat you up? We were worried, honey. You could have told us. Leave her alone. She's crazy. Who said you could talk? Shut up! You, lower your eyes. That doctor better give her more medicines. These are not enough. Go get some bread. There's no more. Get it yourself. Rosa! - It's alright, I'll get it. - Sit down! - Salvatore! Leave her alone! - Shut up! Enough! Don't forget that I was a father to you. Get out! Go away! Let's eat. Rosa, are you alright? What's wrong? Come, sit down. I feel weak, auntie. Weak? Wait... Here, drink. What is it? What's wrong? Nothing, she's not feeling well. Again? The boxes need to be loaded. Go to bed. Keep warm. Hey, Rosa? - Aren't you going to work? - No, not today. - What's the matter? - I don't feel well. How many were there? Four. Did you recognize them? What did they look like? They weren't from here. You never saw them before? Around town? We know who they are, don't we? Tore? Come here. Go call our guys. Hurry up. Go! I'll get those beasts and crush them. Well, Ciccio... What do you need to tell me? Tore... We've been at peace for 20 years. And you know why. Blood and money don't go together. Even now that you started working on your own. You didn't seem so pleased the other night. If I wanted to teach you a lesson... I wouldn't have burned your barn down. Ciccio, I'd like to talk to you in private. Go out. You have nothing to do with what happened to my niece? Do you think... I would sully my honor with a child? With Rosa? Someone wants to trigger us. And he's in our house. A conspirator. Hey? Let's go for a ride. - No, not now. - Come on. You've worked enough. What's wrong? You look nervous. Why did you bring me here? Why? Don't you like it here? I used to come here with your mom. She was one of a kind. She made things up. She was angry at us. She said we were crazy. Do you remember her? Not much. Good for you. You're a good girl. Not like her. You'd never do something crazy. No, uncle. Are you sure? I'm sure. You bastard! You can't even shoot a gun! Filthy dog! What do you want? Rosa... What have you done? Did I hurt you so much? What a family of rats. Rats. Your mother was a rat. And so are you. This is from my mother. Did the D'Antonios come? Yes, they came. And the D'Agostinos? They came, too. Don Ciccio sent a telegram. We'll slaughter them all, like pigs... One by one. Not now. - Let's wait for the right moment. - What can we do? Who gotta wash my father's blood? Your father was my son. I have to decide how and when. You didn't take after him. Thank God I didn't take after you. You would give everything to those dogs. Our money, our house... our animals. You've always lowered your head. It's over now. We won't lower our head anymore. Now take your rosary and pray. It's the only thing you can do. You will come to a sticky end. I don't want to hear this whining anymore! What the fuck are you looking at? Always staring... mute. - Hi, Natale. - Hi. - Are you ready? - Ready. Gianni? Did you call him? I'm here. Let's toast. Alright. Tonight we'll go around town. So everyone can see us. Cheers. Cheers. I'm coming, too. You? Oh, come on... Why not? It's too much for you. Really? Let's see if my cousin is tough. - Where is it? - Calm down, Natale! Here it is. Bust it! Bust it! Let's go! Drink, Gianni! Here. There's a brush and a lipstick. Clean yourself up. He just wants to talk to you. Go. Well? Did you have a late night? What did you celebrate? Nothing. What's wrong? Didn't you love your uncle? Our families have always been enemies. Our fathers... our fathers' fathers. Now someone still wants blood. Do you know what happened last night? Someone... went looking for my father's tomb. Found it. And set it on fire. They burned it! Look at me. If you are all still alive... after all the hell you raised it's thanks to me. The stench of death doesn't wash off easily. I can smell it. What's wrong? You're shaking? I like it when you're scared. You finally smell like a woman. Leave me alone. I won't. There's one thing you must understand. Everything you see... streets, houses, it's all mine. It's easy... if you want. Just sit next to me. Think about it. Don't make me wait for too long. Now you better go. And tell Gianni... the gravedigger, to know his place. We need him alive at the cemetery. - Come here! - Leave me! No, listen to me! Let's go here. Is it true what everybody says? Answer me! Is it true? Stay away from me. We made all this mess for what? To end up like this? With Ciccio? Let's run away! You and I. Really? Where to? You don't get it. This land is doomed. Who says that? They're going to kill us all. Only you can change this filthy place. You're strong. You're stronger than everyone. Don't look for me anymore. Who sends the tree stump? Ciccio, the ghost. His stump is already in the house. Ciccio needs Natale's approval. I give you his approval. Tell Don Ciccio that he doesn't have to worry. Goodbye, Donna Berta. That's what beasts do. That's what we are. You are right. But we're stray... disrispectful beasts. We just get by. Without men like him... We're nothing. Understand? So now it's up to you... to take a stand. How far do we still have to go? What do you mean? To be free. Behind that mountain there's another world. Another life. We don't deserve all this beauty. This is the last time we see this land. No! No! Leave her! Leave her! You still don't understand... People line up to meet me. Parents recommending their daughters. And after all the mess you made... Ciccio chose you. You know why? Why? Because I like women... who need to be tamed. Who paw the ground, like wild horses. Proud. Powerful. What's the matter? Are you angry at me? Because of your friend? What was his name? I can't remember. Gianni. Are you happy now? You didn't even kill him with your hands. You live in the shadows. Like a rat. That's what you are. Are you better than me? The Lord weighs the souls of the dead. I weigh the souls of the living. His was worth nothing. So is yours. I see that fire in you, like your Mom. Shut up. Do you remember her? Your Mommy... I said shut up. She talked so much... Do you remember her? I said shut up! You know she talked? Did they tell you what they did? Did they tell you what they did to your Mommy? They made her drink acid to wash her guilt away. Do you want to end up like her? No. I'll take care of you. I'll tame this heart of yours... I'll bite it out. And you... You have to bow down now. Everyone has to be at my feet. We'll take command. Shush now. I want silence. Accept that. I'm the only one for you. There's only me. Look at me in the eyes. Look at me. Enough drama. Enough drama. Come here. Wait here. Take one, Rosa. I made them. How are things going? Everything's alright. We get by. Without Salvatore... the farm... was too much, too much. Here there's all we need. You abandoned us... Rosa has better things to do now. What about Natale? He's not well. Nata'? Nata'... Don't you came here? Come. Don't be afraid. What's the matter? What's wrong? Are you awake? Are you alright? Come here. Did you lay her down here? Was she dressed like this? Was she still beautiful? Look. It's a girl. She doesn't belong to you. I want to give her... a different destiny. They're coming. A WOMAN
