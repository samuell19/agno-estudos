English Subtitles by your friend, Quester. -It won't be any good! -It's perfect! -It won't be any good! -I never pick a bad watermelon! -Want a bet? -Sure. For what? You're on! Giddy up. -I have to piss! -My tummy hurts! I'm thirsty! You're the one who's no good. Giddy up.. Hold on. Get off now... Oh, my poor little brother isn't feeling well? Open wide! Come on! Open up! Mustafa, you can't just lay there moaning. Welcome Keri, my son, are you well? Doctor Kirkor despite all the warnings our organization has given you... ...you are still treating Turkish patients! See here, I won't warn you again. My boy, what's the difference if a patient is Turkish, English... -A sick man is a sick man. -Don't talk so much! Look here! This is the last time I warn you! Münire, I'm thirsty! -Wait for me please. -Yes sir Mr. Kirkor. Hello there Mehmet my boy Is your father home? He is at school Uncle Kirkor. But Mustafa is upstairs and... ...you are the only one who can save us from his whining... Don't worry, I'll take care of him. -Hello Münire my girl, are you well? -I am fine, thank you Uncle Kirkor. Why do you call him? Are there no doctors left that you have to call an Armenian? It's not the first time he has come here... He has been looking after us since we were babies. I swear, if it were up to these guys they would strangle us all. They use every opportunity they can to get rid of us. ...and you let an Armenian into your house... You're just like your dad Sellim. It's like I'm listening to Uncle Ali Riza talk. What's this got to do with my father? You haven't eaten your dinner Mustafa bey my son. So now I have to give you an injection to make you stronger. Münire please... Uncle Kirkor, if it's alright, could Mustafa eat his meal. ...and if he doesn't get stronger, then you could give him the injection? Will he eat it though? What if he doesn't listen to you again? -I swear I will... Really! -He'll do as I ask, won't you Mustafa? I will. Its bronchitis, like before. Let him rest for a few days. Be careful about what he eats and the medication. Otherwise this could become pneumonia. Goodbye! Goodbye Uncle Kirkor, thank you. Let's go. Sorry to bother you Aunt Aliye, thank you for coming. Don't mention it my dear. I hope he is better soon. -Mehmet! Don't make too much noise! -Alright Münire! Have you seen anything but good from that man? We are the children of the war. We are a generation that grew up, even as babies, on the sorrows of war stories... We did not experience any wars first hand in Van... But there was not a single household that had not suffered the sorrow of warfare. We learned from Grandfather Rasih in the 93 war... ...from our brother Captain Mithat, who died in the Balkan War... My mother passed away, unable to bear the pain of that war. We have all seen the cold face of war, but we have never felt it ''very close''. Until that day... They are dead, both of them. That day I felt what enmity was with my entire heart. Not just enmity... Hate that came up to our doors and the war that quickly caught up our children... Friends... We have a visitor from our Istanbul branch. He has brought us the greetings of Mr. Gabriel, and some instructions... Please Brother Amazaso. -Hello brothers! -Hello... Welcome. When the Russian army attacks Turkey we will start uprisings everywhere... ...and official buildings will be bombed... Our brothers in the Turkish army will desert from their detachments... ...to join the Russian army... -You have spoken to the doctor today? -I spoke with him. It was a very useful interview. Our brothers in Van will continue to arm and support our organization... ...when the army leaves the city successive rebellions will begin. May he rest in peace. My deepest sympathy. Let's go! Select particularly those boys who are of high school age. You will train them to shoot... But don't say they are ''learning to shoot'' or that this is military training... Give it a more family-like atmosphere, like it is a sport. In this way the young men will become more familiar with the rifle. And the Hunchak guerrillas will understand that we aren't just kicking our heels. They are getting more and more out of hand with each passing day. Find the headmaster of the high school Mr. Jemal. If he is free, tell him I would like to drink coffee with him this evening. Yes sir! Inform Jemal Bey of the Pasha's invitation immediately. Ready! Fire! Today, I was invited by the army commander Kâmil Pasha. We had coffee together. He has found a wonderful summer task for you. Training with rifles. First you will be trained, and then there will be a competition... When do we start, papa? I thought you were too ill even to go to the corner shop? Ah, papa! Your turn will come. First the bigger boys. Fire! He missed again. Lieutenant Süleyman? My brother missed again! I and Lieutenant Süleyman knew each other since we were children. Even when we were just starting primary school he would say... ''I'm going to be a lieutenant!'' then he would say ''And I'm going to marry you!'' When the war finished he became a lieutenant and then we got engaged. When we were preparing for our wedding, the Trablus (Tripoli) War began... ...and we said let the war finish and then we will get married... ...and Süleyman went off to war. You missed? Why did you miss? Because you are still scared! Don't worry, the rifle won't go off right away! Give it here! Now watch! You can feel when the trigger engages with your finger. Press until the trigger becomes firm. See, it doesn't go off… When you feel it become hard... Then the rifle is ready to shoot. Go ahead, try! The Trablus War finished, and the Balkan War started, Süleyman went there too. ...it lasted for two years... Good job Mehmet! Do you think we earned some tea? Right away lieutenant! Years later, that summer he came. ...and after all those years we imagined living a summer without war. ...even though everyone was saying that a great war would break out in Europe.'' Sometimes, I think you love him more than me. -Who, Mehmet? -No.Your rifle! -Thank you! -Enjoy it. We were happy. We were planning to get married in the autumn. Ready! Fire! Ready! Fire! The result of the firing competition First place... One of the reasons for last year's defeat in the Balkan War was... ...as Mahmud Muhtar Pasha said... ''Pride and conceit!'' He would say ''Allah doesn't like pride and conceit, and this is why we were defeated!'' As a nation we don't love each other enough! This is the actual problem. At least we don't love each other as much as the people of Western countries. My request to you as an older brother, as an elder... Always love one another, protect one another, watch out for one another, ... Always remain friends. If you argue, don't stop speaking to one another, never! Always keep your hearts together. Both for your own future and for that of your county. What is the latest news in Europe, Governor? I am sure you have the latest news from Istanbul. They say that it isn't very good. Things are heating up. God protect us, but if war breaks out... Then the division might leave the town... Sir, war won't break out inshallah (God willing) and the division will always be with us. -Your Excellency... -Of course, we mustn't fail to be prepared. Well done. -Well, good evening my boy. -Good evening my pasha! -Hello, good evening friends. =Good evening Pasha. My pasha! Your Excellency, we are very grateful for the rifle training... ...that you have provided for our sons... However... This... What does this signify? Our boys will one day, inshallah, finish school and then they will go to the army... My hope is that they are ready a little earlier... It has nothing to do with the war or the Hunchak guerrillas. The training is not because of them! -Good evening Headmaster -Good evening Sermet bey. May Allah give you repose. -Good night Mehmet. -Good night Ferit. Didn't I say to you that if you couldn't do something, you shouldn't try? Get inside. You have totally embarrassed me again! Get inside! Mehmet? Mehmet? The Art of War. ...to our beloved brother Mehmet. First prize in the shooting contest in 1914. With my love... Kâmil Pasha Commander General of the 19th Brigade. -Who are they Sergeant Musa? -Probably Armenians. They are emigrating. They are saying that there will be war again sir! The Russians aren't content with Kars and Ardahan... Now they have their eye on Van and Erzurum... Oh, these are the good Armenians... They aren't interested in rebelling and all that. They just want to get away and save themselves. The guerrillas will join the Russians to try to take everything here... May Allah not leave us in need. Even when the enemy is asleep one must be aware... And the enemy isn't sleeping sir. Giddy up you nag. If you don't get me to Van by afternoon, then there'll be trouble! Hear ye... Hear ye! A general mobilization has been declared! All soldiers are to take up arms! General mobilization has been declared! All soldiers are to take up arms! We are out of sugar. Yes, yes we've heard. I would be surprised if there is no mobilization! Giddy up! Papa! -Mobilization has been declared, Papa! -That's what they're saying! -You're not frightened, are you? -No. We just came to town, we were wandering around. Fine, then take these provisions home, and I will go see Ali Riza. Thank you very much Sergeant Musa, God be with you. Thank you sir! Give a little to the sergeant... He has rights to it after all. Ok papa. Here, Mehmet. I'm tired, you take the reins for a while! Giddy up you old nag! Hear ye... Hear ye. General mobilization has been declared, soldiers are to take up arms! Soldiers are to take up arms! You haven't been around for three days, so you probably haven't heard. Everybody in Europe is at each others' throats; Germans, Russians, English, French. The big war that everybody has been talking about seems to have finally started. That's why there is a general mobilization, we have to be prepared for war too. They are calling all the young men to arms again. So who are we going to fight this time? They say apparently it is not clear yet. Whoever attacks us... At least it is clear who will attack us; the Russians for sure! The Russians for sure, my nephew has just come from Erzurum... He says the Hunchak bastards are openly saying that... ...they will demolish Van. We saw a convoy of Armenians emigrating, Camels...ox carts, children... They have destroyed the country and now naturally they are running away... Shall I tell you something Headmaster Jemal? You should have no mercy for the enemies of the Turks! Wherever you find them... -Selim! Selim! Be right back, Papa. They killed him. Dear or dear... Are there no limits? Where are you going brothers! You belong here, we belong here. -Why would you abandon your own land? -Don't try to stop us. We don't want war or land. We are merely tying to find somewhere for our children to live! If you are thinking of your children, turn back! Up ahead are Turkish gangs, they will chop you into pieces. Turn back and wait for the blessed day. Our Russian brothers will be here soon and this will once again be Armenia! Come on. You are making a big mistake, believe me. Those who listen to us will be saved. If you want to live, listen to us! Don't go! So, Headmaster, you think that the situation in the villages isn't very good? We guessed that the Hunchak activities had increased to such a degree... That is why I wasn't surprised. Look, we have reached such a state that there is a murder nearly every day. So, it seems that we are the next to leave. You are one of the people I trust in this city. Thank you, you are very kind Pasha. There is no need to hide things from you. Information from Erzurum, from the Third Army. They say that the Russians could attack at any moment. ...and we are ordered to transfer to the border as soon as possible... Why worry about not smoking at a time like this. Light one Headmaster! This order is to be kept secret... We don't want the Hunchak guerrillas to learn about our departure... ...until the last possible minute... But I am going to teach them such a lesson. That it will take them a few months to recover. Headmaster! I entrust the young men first to Allah and then to you. How much longer do we have to wait before going into action? General mobilization has been declared. They say we should wait for the Andranik Division to leave. We have to wait! -What if they don't go? -Don't worry. It won't be long! Van will be ours, all ours! It will be ours. Stop talking so much and get busy, come on, get on with it. It will be ours, all ours! One day we will be freed from this torment, one day. We will strike to the East and to the West with lightning, hail one day. We will shine in the black clouds and strike with lightning... We will send thunder, hail one day. From Kars, Batum, the Caucasus... ...we will destroy the forts with the national cannons, one day. We are born as Turks, we will live as Turks, and we will always be Turks... One day we will be free from this vile Russian grip, one day! Bravo! Well done! Hurray! Bravo! I swear, he is not just the great Selim, but Yavuz Sultan Selim. Allah! It is time for evening prayer. We've lost track of time! What is happening? Ferit, where are you going? It's late. Come here! What are you stupid or something? Huh? Don't you ever use this? Mobilization has been declared, everybody is on alert… ...the streets are full of villains and thieves... Our little friend isn't worried at all, enjoying himself all night! Where are you going? Come here! Sit down there and listen to me! The situation isn't good. War is about to break out. We have to leave Van immediately! Your uncle has written to us. He is looking for a safe place for the family in Istanbul. He asks us to come too. He says ''Send Ferit ahead''. Go, get out of here! My dear, are you hungry? There are some beans. No, thank you mother, I ate with Mehmet! Look what you've done to this boy. He can't think of anything but his stomach! Is a war going to start? If war breaks out... Does Lieutenant Süleyman have to go? Of course he will go. He is the one they really need and he will be one of the first to go. -What about you? -I'm not old enough yet. But if they send me of course I will go. Did I do all that training for nothing? But I haven't had any training yet! Don't be in such a rush...You are still too young. By the time it is your turn the war will be long over. Don't think about such things, it's time to go to sleep. May Allah give you comfort! Mehmet... Will Chubby Ferit go as well? Sir, after the arrival of the 48th troop at the border... Our transition will be completed. Are there any questions? Keep your eyes peeled... They have managed to take away much from us. If they attack again they will be attacking to take everything! My father... talks of nothing but Istanbul this, Istanbul that. It's all he can think about... Sometimes... I wish that I was dead and free of all this! If you are going to die then die in the war! Why are you wasting your life for nothing here? We won't be here much longer at any rate! My father keeps saying ''The situation is very serious'' And He can't talk about anything else. He says we have to move as soon as possible. Are you moving or running away? Why don't you ask your dad when you get home? Give him my greetings. Cowards! Why don't you leave him alone? What has he done? The way his father... If the father is not a man what can you expect from the son? He should say ''I'm not going, I'm not running away''... He should say, there's been a call up, why don't you join up... Ferit! Wait, I'm coming too. Ferit! Sometimes, you know, sometimes you really are no good! -Mehmet, we're going home! -Don't get wet! Go under the leaves. Come on, we should go too. Come on. Let's go, come on. Mustafa! Just look at you! You've only just gotten better! Uncle Sabri's son died in training. -They all went to give their condolences. -Why didn't you go? I couldn't. I need some more time. What does this mean? What do you think? For Mehmet, to give to him. A present. -I'll be back! -When will you come? I'll be here at the first chance I get. So many days... So many days. I guess you didn't have a chance. And now you give me this gun... When are you going? We're not going anywhere Sultan Münire. We will be here. Sure... ...and that is what you said when you went to the Trablus War. I didn't see you for three years then. That was different. Believe me my dear, nothing will happen! What about the mobilization? And you are transferring to the border and the war? Even if you don't go now, you will go in the end! Take this... A present from me. Even my father didn't give the slightest indication... It was only days later that I realized you had gone... And without you the city was empty, it had become another city. I am afraid, but I am happy! Because I am grateful that there is no war yet. And that, inshallah, there never will be... Do you know what saddens me most? Forget spending holidays together. But years have gone by and we have not been able to share a Ramadan meal. That is fate. Next year, inshallah! May Allah keep you safe my Süleyman, Your Münire. -May you have a blessed holiday, sir. -Happy holidays to you Commander! -Headmaster, blessed holiday! -And to you too. -Happy holidays! -Happy holidays! Sir, there is a telegram for you. The Russians have gone on the attack towards Erzurum. The war has started gentlemen. 3 MONTHS LATER We don't have enough ammunition at the front. Thank God there is fog everywhere and the Russians cannot move. Otherwise they would have destroyed us by now. We don't have enough ammunition even for a week! Lieutenant Colonel Ali Ihsan said we had requested ammunition from Erzurum. Is there no news? Erzurum is waiting for more from Istanbul. Istanbul is waiting for more from Germany. The Germans say it'll arrive tomorrow. I don't get it as things are being dragged out so long... ...then why are we asking for help all the way from Erzurum... ...instead of bringing the ammunitions that are in Van? Just last month we asked for reinforcements from Van. They sent everyone including the prisoners in the jail... Other than 3-5 guards in the city, there is not a man left who can hold a gun. Now you suggest that we take what ammunitions they have left? I pray that Kâmil Pasha doesn't hear you... ...or he will make you go get the munitions in Van. ...and carry them here on your back. Today we spoke with the governor of Erzurum. Our division isn't letting the Russians through, thank God. However... As a result of 3 months of war there aren't many cartridges left… And if replacement munitions don't arrive quickly from Erzurum... ...they say that the situation will be very serious... Ibrahim Bey, the commander of the Home Guard, and myself thought... ...we have decided to send the remaining munitions in the city to the division... We are going to send it but there are no horses or carts left. We will send it, we want to send it but how? -Headmaster, your tea! -Thank you Ragip Efendi. So, Headmaster? What kind of measure do you suggest? We should carry the munitions ourselves! That is all fine and well Headmaster. How many people are we here... Let's say we put the munitions on our backs and set out... ...the front is at least a five to six day walk... What happens if we aren't strong enough and the munitions lay wasted in the mountains? Moreover, if we go, the school, hospital, the province... The city will all be completely abandoned. The most important thing is the security of our city. Our division broke the back of the wretched Hunchaks. However, they are watching us... If we go, who will protect our homes if, God forbid, there is an attack? -Sir I have a suggestion, but... -Go ahead. I hate to say it but... if there is no other way I have a 16 year old son... My only fortune in this world, my only possession, the light of my eye... I give you my son. Let us gather all the boys of his age who are at the school and in the city. Doctor, what kind of suggestion is that? I'll pretend I didn't hear it! Headmaster, I leave our young ones to Allah and you. Protect them from danger and accidents... ...the best that you can... Are we the only ones who will protect our homes against the Russians? Are we to say to our children ''You are too little, stay where you are?'' At the moment, thank God, the Russians are not yet at our door... ...the Hunchak guerrillas have been broken... No matter how difficult it is, I can see no other solution... Go home and ask your wife about your idea. Let's see if she is as generous as you. What kind of a mother would agree to send her child on such a dangerous duty, doctor? What kind of a mother... What kind of a mother... We'll take the munitions ourselves, the children are too young... Doctor if you had suggested that you and I, only us, were to carry the munitions... ...believe me, that would have been much more reasonable! But our children? Let them take the children they say! As if I found my son in the street... I'm gonna load him with goods and send him off into the mountains! Send your own children! Well, I don't understand either, but let's wait and see what happens. -Good evening. -Good evening! As if my son could save the county! Open up! Did you die! Everybody in the city has gone mad. Everybody! We're leaving, start packing. Don't waste time with trinkets. Just take what we will need on the road. We'll set up home in Istanbul again. We'll set out tomorrow before the sun is up. Get on with it! Why are you just sitting there? Get up now or I'll kill you! -I'm.. -What? I'm not coming Papa. What do you mean ''I'm not coming''? Stay out of it woman! -How can you talk to your father... -I'm not coming! Ungrateful wretch! You are no longer my son! Stay here then! Stay and... Ingrate! If war breaks out does Lieutenant Süleyman have to go? Of course he will go. He is the one they really need. -...he will be one of the first to go. -And you? If the division wasn't in the city there is no doubt that those murderers. the Hunchak guerrillas would have killed Dr. Kirkor in our own house. ...and us as well... Stay away from that! Haven't all these separations been enough? How many more people will I have to cry for? If it were me, I would go, Mehmet! That night, we experienced the darkest moments of our lives One side were thousands of soldiers waiting hopelessly for ammunition at the front. Süleyman... Every house had a Lieutenant Süleyman. …left without ammunition in the middle of the war. In every house a son, a father. On the other side those who had not yet had their fill of childhood...the young saplings that had not yet experienced Spring. I could do nothing... ...half of my heart was pleading, screaming ''Don't go boys, don't do this...'' While the other half was shouting ''Don't hesitate! Run! Go right now! My duty is to protect you, not to throw you out on a dangerous journey Is it not our duty sir to make sure that... ...the enemy does not trample the graves of our brothers? Yes, yes, this is our duty, yes... That's my father! Well, if it is your father, so what nephew? What are you frightened of? What's all this! This isn't a barn you know! -Is he here? -He's here. Come and get him if you think you can. Ferit! Ok, ok, Ferit go home. But you, come inside! Ferit! Come boy. You go home son. Your dad and me are gonna have a talk! Look here! I'm just gonna say this once; leave the boy alone! Don't interfere with him! He has made his decision and he is going with his friends! He's not going anywhere! Look here sir! I'm telling you this for your own good and this is the last time I will tell you... How can he go? He's still just a child. We are all small in your eyes man. You think you are the only great person in the universe, you and Allah... Hah. If you still believe in Him that is! Then you go with him! Stay with him! I'll give you whatever you want! Money, it's always money with you! Is it not enough that you made people fall out just for the sake of money... ...so that you would get rich? I haven't done anything brother, really. I've done nothing! Stop sniveling brother! Now you remember who your relatives are! What were you thinking when you sold that Hunchak filth weapons... ...for a few pennies? Now those weapons are aimed at our children! -See what your greed has bought you! -What weapons? What money? Say your prayers you wretch! Say your prayers! Brother! Are you still tying to fool us? Where did you get all that money? Where did you get all that money? I swear brother I didn't sell them any weapons! Brother, I swear I didn't know the weapons were going to them! I swear on my children, I didn't know brother! If I had known would I have done it? Would I brother? -Get out of here now! -Ok brother! Leave the boy alone! Let him do whatever he wants! If I hear even a whisper of something... If I even suspect... I will rip you apart with my bare hands, got it? Now get out of here! Ferit! My son! My life! Don't leave me, son, don't leave me! Now! This is a very difficult and serious patriotic duty... Those who are willing, of their own accord, to volunteer, take one step forward! My children! My boys! Any obligations you may owe me, any before I have made, I relinquish them. Bless you! Bless you! That day with a unified desire on the part of our students... 120 boys were chosen for this great journey. 120 children between 12 and 17. First we turned to dressing them for the weather... ...because this was to be a long journey... Long and arduous. For days and nights, they would be crossing snowy mountains... Those families that could gave sheets, curtains, blankets, whatever they had... 32 children who were 15 or over were given rifles and were quickly trained. Plans were made for our children on this long journey. All details were considered. The governor appointed some soldiers to provide extra security. ''Our children need these more than we do'' they said and gave them to the convoy. May Allah make it complete! 120 children... ...as if missing you is not enough, now the worry of our children... 120 children... ...as if missing you is not enough, now the worry of our children... ...has settled in our hearts. Our prayers are with you. Allah keep my Süleyman safe... Keep all of you safe. Your Münire. Sister! Could you give this to Reyhan? With Allah's will we will deliver the munitions and in the same way... ...I will deliver this letter, to Lieutenant Süleyman, inshallah. -110! -Here! -111 ! -Here! -112! -Here! -113! -Here! -114! -Here! -115! -Here! -116! -Here! -117! -Here! -118! -Here! -119! -Here! -120! -Here! I am the last one Sergeant! Children! My sons! Your journey is long and treacherous! You will cross impassable mountains! Once you have started on your way it will not be possible to turn back! Be careful! My boys... You older boys look out for the younger ones... ...you younger ones, listen to the the older boys. Try to keep hold of each other as much as possible and do not leave the line. If you have any difficulties inform Sergeant Musa right away! Now my boys! Now my brave ones! May Allah make your way clear. May he bless our war effort. -My little soldiers! -Brother, please don't go. Now lads! Forward march! ♪ The most glorious army, the most glorious soldiers... ...on to victory. The most glorious army... ...the most glorious soldiers, on to victory. In one hand a shield, in one hand a dagger... ...on to the front. Oh glorious soldier! Even on the sea, all is victorious... Allah's name on our lips, Allahu Ekber! May our army always be victorious! -39 Idris! -Here! 41 Abdullah! -Here! 43 İzzetin! -Here! 44 Muharrem! -Here! 45 Ali Kemal! -Here! 47 Ferit! -Here! Come on lads. Come on. -I think the time is right. -Not yet be patient! Let them get a bit more tired, and then we'll pick them off, one by one! Let's get to the horses! The Hunchak guerrillas were seen near the Abadan village, sir. Along the route the children are walking... -There were many of them. -When were they seen? Two days ago! What a state we are in! They call us a division, but we don't have enough forces for anything... Our ammunition is spent, desperately we wait for a handful of bullets carried... ...on the back of our children, that will only help for a few days. This is what happens if you go to war on the promises of the Germans... Our own neglect, our own lack of will, and own incompetence means that... ...our own innocent children have to undergo these difficulties in the spring of their lives... Put together a detachment of the strong ones, but hurry... Yes sir! -Süleyman. -Yes sir? Be careful! -116 Bahatin! -Here! -117 Selim! -Here! -118 Abdullah! -Here! -119 Ramazan! -Here! -120 Hakki, son of Enver? -Here!

Go around them! Quickly! Stay down! Soldiers! Forward! -Is anyone wounded? -We are fine, sir. -Sergeant Musa! -My Süleyman! My sister's fiancé is here. They saved us. We have been saved thank God! Attention! Now, lads. Head for the front. Those are our men! Our men! Süleyman... They were in Abadan on the 23rd, and they passed Tadan on the 24th... They are coming my dear, they are coming... To make the route shorter, they have left the main road... ...and are taking a shortcut through the mountains. Thank god! They will come much faster now they are carrying less... The governor says they did remarkably well, to cover eighty kilometers in two days. Our little brothers were lucky those days as the weather was so good... No one was worried in Van anymore. I'll never forget that evening... ...the evening of 24 January. We experienced the first night of peace of mind in ten days... Come on lads. Forward march! Mehmet, the weather is turning. Don't let anyone separate from the line. Everyone stay close. -Pass it down the line. -Yes sir Sergeant. Friends! Everyone stay close... Link arms! Don't stop! Everyone stay close! Everyone stay close. Come on lads. Come on. Go! Go! Go! Papa! Papa! Papa! -Papa. Look outside! -What's the matter dear? Papa. Look outside! Slow down, dear. Don't be so quick to worry. Papa, where are you going? To the governor's office; perhaps they have some news. It's not long to morning now. I can't let you go on your own in this weather! I'm coming too. -Is the governor in? -He's upstairs. Please come in Miss, I'll take that. -Teacher Jemal is here, he wants to see you. -Show him in. Yes sir. -Headmaster, welcome. Please come... -Thank you. ...and sit down. My dear, come sit here please. Do you have any information about the children? I have been trying all night but... ...the telegraph lines are frozen... It is impossible to get in touch with anybody. We must pray that the storm hit there earlier... ...and that the children saw it and did not leave their places, inshallah. There is nothing we can do, but be patient and wait right now. If you look at the matter from a positive aspect, Headmaster... ...at least the children aren't carrying anything! Come on lads! Come on. Those who are in the rear, hold on to those in front of you. Papa... Papa, let's go. Münire! We waited. We waited the whole day for some news... All through the day, with the hours seeming like centuries, we heard nothing. My father and the others wanted to go up in the mountains and look... However, the governor refused to let any parent leave the city... Until we receive news about our children no one is to leave the city! Where will you go? Where will you look? Perhaps they don't even know where they are... Only Allah knows where they are. Get up. Get up. Mehmet... Get up. Get up. My boy! Where is my son? Come on!.. Where is my lamb? Where is my love? 120 of our children set out on the journey, however, only 40 managed to return. Selim. Ferit. Sait, Abdullah. Sergeant Musa... They left, but they did not return. -Hussein, son of Riza. -No change! -Ismet, son of Rahmi! -Improvement! -Izzetin, son of Muharrem. -Improvement! -Idris, Son of Sadullah! -No change! Cezmi, Son of Talat! Uncle, wait. Headmaster, it is you. Pass.

Hakki, son of Enver! Hakki, son of Enver! Hakki is my grandson, his father is in Yemen! Granddad, come over here! Make way, let him through, make way! Granddad, your grandson has passed away. May Allah grant those who remain a long life. Condolences. What are you saying? What are you telling me? Believe me my dear, nothing will happen! Don't worry Münire. With Allah's will we will deliver the munitions... ...and in the same way I will deliver this letter to Lieutenant Süleyman, inshallah'' What do you think? For Mehmet to give him heart, a present. Take this, a present from me. Of the 120 children who left Van in January 1915, only 22 remained. 98 died martyrs and they were honored with eternal life... ...among the honored annals of our national history. My Süleyman... You went along with your brothers. May you be in heaven. We commemorate with gratitude all these heroes... ...even though we do not know their names... ...who gave heroically of their sweat, blood and lives without hesitation... ...to protect our county, our future, for our children,... ... securing a peaceful, healthy and bountiful life in Turkey. Those self-sacrificing heroes should know that none of their efforts were in vain. And as long as the world lasts they will not be in vain. May they rest in peace and light!
