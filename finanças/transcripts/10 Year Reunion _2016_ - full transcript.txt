All right Carly, you first. Let's get this time capsule party started. Okay. Okay, Patty your turn. When Patty's countless papers paved the way to owning her own law firm. Sealed with a kiss of death. What does that mean? It means these secrets are going to the grave, where they belong. Sure you don't want to throw that dress in there while we're at it? I love this dress. Oh we noticed. Stop. Amen to goodbyes, I certainly will not miss these memories. Now your turn Abby. Ooh, not this one, we'll frame it. So what's on the disc, Abs? Oh our favorite senior mix, which you can all hear at the party tomorrow night. Yeah right. Whoa no peeking, not until our 10 year reunion. We each have to swear on this capsule no matter where we are, or what we're doing in 10 years we're going to return to Harmony and open this thing together, swear. Yep. Cuddle hug swear. So where are you going to bury it? Um, I don't know. I was thinking about tearing up the garden out back. Rose's mother would kill. Well then wouldn't you like to know? Come on, Abs, I mean you have to tell us. We have a right to know. Fine, I knew you'd make this one of your ridiculous games. I think we should leave it to Abby, she's the only one we know we can trust. You don't even trust yourself? Okay in 10 years our deepest, darkest secrets, and our greatest fears for the future will finally be revealed. Happy graduation, Harmony High! Let the mayhem ensue. Hi guys! Woo, yeah! ♪ I don't know who I am ♪ ♪ I don't know where I've been ♪ ♪ Started out as a dream ♪ ♪ Saw it in a magazine ♪ ♪ Saw me how to be me ♪ Hey why don't you put that thing down and try joining the party? Nope, she can't, she has to document these last few moments of our high school career. It's all we'll have left of Harmony in a few weeks' time. Cheers! Do you think Abby's okay she seems a little off tonight. She's only had two drinks. She's such a lightweight, look at her. Shane, did you give her one of your cheapo jello shots? No, no. - Did you? - No don't look at me. I feel like you did. You did it, Shane. It's Shane's fault, it's all Shane's fault. Shane. Whoa, baby chill, chill out, chill out. Are you paying for that? Abby are you okay? Guys I don't think she's okay. We need to help her. Okay, oh my God. Tres wasted. Whoa, whoa my God. Oh my god. Abby. I think she has alcohol poisoning her eyes should not be doing this. Can someone call 911? Should we call... Abby, Abby, Abby. Please someone. Come on, Patty we have to go. I'm sure Rose and Erica will keep you company. Besides, Spence is in the middle of that big case there's just no way we can go. Well does your fiance have to come? We could just have a girls trip. Oh yeah, fun in Harmony. You loathed that snotty, stuck-up town, too. Wait, I know what this is about. You're hoping Shane will be there. Yeah, you mean Abby's Shane? Come on, don't act like you didn't have feelings for him. Abby is the reason I want to go, we made a promise to her. What promise? That we'd come home and dig up that time capsule she buried for us. Oh wow, the time capsule. I completely forgot. All of our last memories with Abby are still in there. Fine, if it means that much to you to go chasing some silly treasure. Then I will go, for you. But you owe me. Okay, cheers. Is it weird for you going back? No, you know Harmony's one of those towns that never changes. Well actually, Rose, said we could stay with her. But we haven't spoken to Rose in years. I know. Seems kind of strange, doesn't it? Only because I thought I'd be in a different place by now. I mean, I take headshots of bad actors, you've got the fiance, real estate, sustainable income. Oh shush, your headshots are amazing. You know I had a hard time believing in my work even then. Yeah, but that's always been your quirk. You know at some point, you gotta love yourself enough to fight for life. Fight for life, from what? Your fears, you can't let them get to you. You gotta fight back. Like this. Like that? Stronger, come on. Give it to me. You're such a dork. You are so crazy, calm down. You guys are really here. Hi pretty ladies, wait, wait, wait for it. Cuddle hug. Oh my gosh. Carly you have not changed a bit. Aww, it's good to see you, Rosie. Oh my God, Rose, would you look at Patty's ring? Oh my God. It's almost as big as mine. Yes, but mine didn't come from a congressmnan, overachiever. Oh, ha, you are the overachiever okay? I was just born with legs and good teeth, honey. That's true. What about you, Carly, are you still with that guy from the Cabo pics? No, no that was ages ago. Aww. You know Shane was just telling us last night that he and his girlfriend recently broke up, too. You don't say? But don't worry there's gonna be plenty of men to mingle with this weekend. And just think they're going to have half the acne and make 10 times the salary. Thank God. Right, bags, bags, bags. Yes. For Patty, and for Carly. No, no, no, I'm good actually with water, thank you though. Oh, sparkling water? Yes, I know what you're thinking, and no I'm not pregnant. Right? What about you Erica? You want some kids? Uh, hopefully soon. And you're still in D.C.? Six years. Wow. My husband is running for senate now. That's why you're posting all those photos at all those fancy events. Wow, see you really did it. You're a lawyer, and you look amazing. Thanks to Carly and the power of a great paycheck, I discovered laser eye surgery, an arsenal of cosmetics, and a brand new wardrobe. Nice. Thanks. What are you up to now, Carly? Carly is doing exceptionally well as a freelance photographer. She does headshots for the local theaters and shoots some of the biggest weddings in town. So our most artistic is living her dream. You know you should post photos sometime so we can see them. You should but I thought you were going to go into photojournalism. Didn't you use to say that you wanted to take photos that would change the way we see the world? Yeah... Who says she isn't? Oh, I'm so sorry, that didn't come out right. I didn't mean it that way. No it's fine, I know how you meant it. It just takes time, you know? Yes, life is a constant work-in-progress. Wise words from Wilfredo my spin class instructor. So what about you, Rosie? What happened to ballet academy? Oh, well you know, after Chase and I got married and he started working for Harmony PD, it just kind of fell to the wayside a little bit. You know I always knew you guys would get married. I bet your wedding was beautiful. Yes it was. It was really nice. And you know it kind of made it feel like home again. After... Anyway, you guys were missed. It was definitely not the same without you there. Yeah, we were sorry we couldn't be there. We felt terrible. Oh please don't, no. I understood, it's okay. Besides what matters is that we are all here together now, right? Yes, cheers. Cheers. To Harmony High's senior sweethearts together again. For a reunion to remember. Cheers. Running low on wine. Car, you still with us? Yeah, just wishing Abby was here. Yeah who's gonna paint my toenails 20 shades of hot pink. Hey, when'd you stop drinking anyway? I didn't I just felt weird tonight. Really, why? I know I'm not going to die of alcohol poisoning or anything, I just keep thinking of her here, and I just can't. Car, you know Abby didn't die of alcohol poisoning, right? Of course she did we all saw it. Carly, Abby died of a drug overdose. It was the Pink Lady pill mixed with the booze that killed her. How did you not know this? What are you talking about? The Ecstasy pills that we took that night. Hey is everything okay over here? Yeah, yeah we're good, coming we're good. Right, bring the wine, because the boys just got back from the pub. Look I'm so sorry, I even brought it up. It's in the past, right? We're here to celebrate not dig up old skeletons, okay? Come on let's go have fun, okay? Look who I found hiding out. Wow, hi honey. Well I do declare the ol' gang back together again. Oh my God, I didn't even recognize you, without the hair and the goggles, Pats. Thanks. I guess I'm not the only blind one in Harmony. Who let you into law enforcement? Aww, he's a great Sherriff. Good to see you. How are you doing? I see you haven't changed. Oh no, I'm still devilishly handsome, I know. Yeah you are. No big deal. Carly. Shane, how are you doing? You staying here too? I am. It's good to see you. Good, yeah. Okay, okay, let's go sit, come on. Okay everyone, let's sit, let's sit, go, go, go. Yeah, get in there, you. Be nice. Love this wine. I know it's a good one, it's a little stinky I'm sorry. I appreciate this wine, it's my favorite. Regardless of the cheap wine, it's so nice we're all here. Except we're not all here. Are we? Guys, I'm, I'm sorry. I just want to ask. Am I the only one who didn't know that Abby died of a drug overdose? How is that even possible? Ya'll know that Abby didn't touch drugs. Right? Well, apparently that night she did. Whatever Molly was laced with, didn't mix well with the alcohol. I saw the toxicology report myself. Well then it was wrong. At the funeral Abby's mom said that she died of alcohol poisoning. That's because she didn't see the original. My dad had the coroner make up a new copy for everyone else. What? Why would he do that? Because the coroner's a family friend. Why would he lie about her cause of death, that's insanely illegal. And so is ecstasy. My dad didn't want us getting slapped with a law suit from all the other parents, I mean, the underage drinking. It was bad enough. Abby was just so against drugs. Doesn't make sense that she would take some stupid pill in the first place. Carly, it's a mistake that we've all lived to regret. But is this really the time to be bringing all this up? I mean. Maybe being back is getting to you. Yeah, maybe you wanna lay down for a little bit? Yeah, maybe you should get some rest. You'll feel better in the morning. Okay, um... I'm sorry, good night. Carly, it's Chase. You all right? I was outside locking the gate and I saw you walking around up here. Did you see that man? What man? I saw someone in the garden. The teenagers down the hill, they come up and they hop the fence and they play hide and go seek. Okay, I wouldn't worry about it. You gonna be okay? Yeah. I'll be fine. 'Kay, good night, Car. Good night. You okay? Yeah. Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't know either. I just wish someone had told me. I know. Morning. Bottomless mimosas at our table at Marigold's. Who's in? Okay, no, no let's talk about my seamen dressing. Oh, can I get another mimosa? Thank you so much. Oh wow, take it easy, champagne Sally. It's only noon. So, Rose, you never told us what you're doing now. Oh, well, actually I work at the school. I teach Junior English and I coach cheer. Wow, I think that's exactly what I wrote for you in our senior prediction, how funny. But you knew that I was planning to attend the ballet academy after school. I mean, we all had plans to leave Harmony, so. Yeah, I think I just knew you were comfortable here. Great money, family, Chase. Some of us well, some of us had to work a little harder for what we wanted in life, is all. So, Carly, what did you predict about me? How much of it came true? You know, I don't remember. It's all in my time capsule confession though. Wow, now that you mention it, I do recall Abby telling me about your homemade box of sinful secrets. Oh my God, the time capsule! I totally forgot about that. I mean, a bunch of old junk, who wouldn't? This gal here, she is on a one woman mission to dig it up before the reunion weekend is over. Am I right, Car? Seriously? Unless one of you already beat me to it. I saw someone in the garden last night. Wait, hold on. You saw a creep in our garden last night, and you didn't say anything? No, I told Chase, he said it was one of the neighbor kids probably, but I thought it may have been one of you. Out in that garden at night alone? No way, that's creepy. We made a promise to Abby. Carly, Abby isn't here. And, a lot's changed since high school. Well, what's in that time capsule hasn't. You guys, don't you see? It's like a part of Abby that's still alive, a part of her that's never been heard. She would want us to find it. Or, maybe maybe we all agree that we let whatever's buried, stay buried. Mmm-hmm. Check please. Oh my God, Carly you scared me. Those red ones are poisonous, remember? Yeah. I spaced out, I guess. My husband and I are fighting over the phone. Oh no, what's going on? He wants me to come to some dinner that he has on Friday. He knew I had this reunion. Sometimes I think he just doesn't care. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna enjoy my weekend and spending time with my girlfriends. Good. Hey do you remember that time we snuck my brother's four-wheeler driving out across town in the middle of the night, and I had just dumped that jerk, Chet... Chett Bennett, yeah. And Abby thought it would be a good idea if we cover his house in toilet paper. Wow, yeah. Abby was a good friend. And I understand why finding this capsule means so much to you. But I agree with Rose, who wants to unearth old demons? Yeah, I understand. And if I find it, we don't have to open your box. Okay? Okay, thank you, appreciate that. Hey, I'm sorry to ask again, but the night of that party, did Rose and Abby have some kind of fight that I don't know about? I don't know, I mean, why do you ask? I don't know. I wonder if that's the reason that Rose is so sensitive about it. I mean if they did it wouldn't surprise me. I'm sure Rose thought Chase still had feelings for Abby ever since they dated for a hot minute back in freshman year. I think Rose wondered if she was a consolation prize. Why would she be resentful of Abby? She couldn't control how Chase felt. Yeah, but, come on. Carly, I'm sure Abby still had feelings for Chase, too. I mean when have you ever known Rose to be jealous for no reason? Mmm. X marks the spot. The lion statue? Hey! Carly! Car, what are you doing out here? Oh, you know exactly what's she doing, and it's morbid, okay? No, I'll tell you what's morbid. I found Abby's toxicology report last night. And I really wish that one of you had been honest about how many pills Abby took. You found what toxicology report? It was in your dad's old filing cabinet. You went snooping through my dad's cabinet? Carly, that's so messed up. Why didn't one of you tell me that what Abby really died of, was an overdose of PMA? PMA what is that? Para-Methoxyamphetamine, it was in those ecstasy pills. And at a certain dosage it's lethal. Well, it's not exactly like we knew what was in those pills. From what they found in her liver, she had to have taken the equivalent of four pills. What if Abby was drugged? Ugh, come on Carly. Everybody loved Abby, nobody in their right mind would actually allowed her to take that many pills. If one of us would have seen her, we would have stopped her. What if one of the guys drugged her to get her into bed? No way, no Chase was the only other person who took one besides us anyway, and none of the other guys even knew we had a stash. And we only had the other four in case one of you wanted to have fun with us, too. 'Kay, wait so you're saying she took all of them? No way, it had to have been someone else. What exactly are you saying here, Car? You think one of us drugged her? Guess not. I just don't see how else it could have happened, it doesn't make any sense. Hey, I'm fairly certain Abby had no idea what she was taking. It happens with kids more than you know. And I think as together as Abby was, she just made one great decision that she had no idea she was making. Yeah. Maybe you're right. I'm sorry for bringing it up again. Still really miss her. Aw, sweetie, we all do. Come here. It's okay. X marks the spot. So, you think Abby left this for us? Sounds like something she would do. And, here we go. Hey guys, welcome back to school. Rose, I really hope your cleaning lady didn't find this first, but now that you found me, I have to wonder if I'm even sitting in the room with you guys as I speak. My guess is not, since so many of you would rather see me dead right now. Which, brings us to confession numero uno of the weekend. I know what's in the capsule. I already read our confessions. All of them, I know, lame, but in case some big earthquake comes and swallows it whole in the next ten years, I wanted to be sure someone had all of the information. But, now I realize maybe burying our secrets wasn't the best idea Harmony High's valedictorian ever had. I now worry our friendships won't survive the next 10 years. But if they do, and we come back together for this, please remember why we're friends. My best advice is forget that capsule ever existed in the first place. But I realize you each have a right to know, too, so I won't hold you back. That said, I did devise a ceremony, a scavenger hunt to make it a bit harder to find. You may have already tried digging up poor Rose's garden, but your efforts will have been in vain because I have devised four clues as we take a trip down memory lane, each answer to which only one of you holds the key, like the one around my neck. This will ensure no one else finds dirt on us, too. Well if I am there by the way, glad to see you back, but shh! Mums the word. Now onto our first clue, which you can find tucked into the frame, but just so you've all been warned, you might not like what you find. Oh God. One for our girl with the golden hair. Your sweet 16 surprise is our fav memory there. Rosie? Sweet 16, that's when your parents threw you that rager, remember? Oh yeah, I had the tiered cake, the new car, the caterers, all of it. But Abby. She was the best thing about that sweet birthday. She showed up at my house like 8 a.m. And we walked down to that giant tree, you know the one where we used to have the tree fort? And Abby and she remembered, too, and she just threw this whole elaborate tea party. Wow. It's just, surreal, seeing Abby like that, huh? Hey, where are you going? Patty, did you hear what she said? About the capsule not being buried out back? No, that every one of us would rather see her dead. Car, I'm pretty sure she meant that figuratively. I think she saw something in that capsule that she shouldn't have. Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah, I was just gonna put this somewhere safe. Oh, okay, well, try to hurry 'cause we still need to get a game plan together for tomorrow. You wanna help find the capsule? No, I meant decorating the terrace. You guys still aren't talking about digging up that capsule, are you? Guys, you heard Abby on the video just now. She said to forget about it. It's just a bunch of bad memories. Maybe she's right, Car. Look, Rose, I don't want to drudge up bad memories for anyone, but I thought that capsule might help us find some good ones. Like the one you had just now. Yeah, that was sweet, but what's in that capsule isn't and it would ruin the entire weekend, and not to mention, we don't even have a key, remember? Abby was the only one who had one. Yeah that's true, we don't, but... So you agree then? Good, so please hurry because I really need opinions on these table tapestries, stat. Were you really serious about not looking for the capsule? Not a chance in hell. You heard what Abs said, we have a right to know, too. Hey, you seem sad, or lost. You were always so happy in school. Oh, I'm fine, what about you? How's your life? Well, I write training manuals for accountants. Woo, super exciting stuff. As long as you're happy. I am. What about you? Eh, most of the time. Look, I know the whole Abby drug thing's been bothering you, I don't think you're totally off either. Something about that night just doesn't add up anymore. On that video, Abby said all of us wanted her dead. Maybe someone did. Yeah, but see everybody loved Abby, that's what I can't wrap my head around. Maybe they didn't. Earlier Erica insinuated that something might have been going on with Abby and Chase just before graduation. I'm sorry, I know she was your girlfriend. I kinda suspected that something was going on with them again, too. How did everyone know except me, I mean, why didn't she tell me, I was her best friend. I don't know, I guess maybe she was just too afraid to admit it to herself. I never lied to him for her. Always told her if she stayed with him, he'd only be holding her back. What'd you say about me? I liked you. You were good for her, I thought. So were you. Good for Abby, I mean. Guess you were good for me, too. Where's Erica? Uh, I think she's helping Rose and Patty pack up decorations up front. Okay, what's this doing here? I don't know, it was there when I came in. Chase, seriously did you leave that creepy message on my mirror? What are you talking about? Hey, where's Rose? Um she's down by the pond feeding the coy, you don't look so good. You should take this, it's for you. Okay. One for our beauty, with the most beautiful heart. Every time it got broken, here we'd find a new start. What's she talking about? Every time I had a breakup, Abby would plan a night out, sneak me off to Marigold and we'd take pictures and stuff our faces with triple berry cake. Well, then I guess it's a good thing that's where we're headed. Suppose you found that down by the old tree last night. Fine, you know, if finding the capsule means that much to you, I'm not gonna try and stop you. But my secret, it's mine. And I want it to stay that way. Okay? Patty, could you come with me? Yeah. We'll be back in a second. It was, it was right here. Look, yes, it's creepy that someone was in your room while you were sleeping. But whoever it is, clearly isn't trying to hurt you, otherwise they would have. Well that's reassuring. Since whoever it is is trying to cover up the tracks of our friend's potential homicide. Just because someone played paintball berry war with your wall, doesn't make them a homicidal maniac, Car. Why else would someone steal Abby's toxicology report unless they felt it was real evidence against them? You stole it first, remember? And maybe Rose took it, because she didn't want her dad to get into trouble. Someone was threatening me last night, Patty. That's the bottom line. Maybe it's the speculative law mind in me, but Chase used to pull crap like this all the time, remember? Look, maybe it wasn't a joke. But I still am not convinced that Abby was murdered. And if we're gonna go there, we're gonna need something a lot more concrete to go on. Don't forget the spots. No, I'm gonna get it. Okay, you got it. The watermarks. Yes, exactly. Hey, guys, can we twist that before we put it up? Like the other one? Thank you. Hey, can you stall Rose? I need Erica's help finding the next clue. Yeah. Hey Rose, can you show me how you want the silverware set up on the tables? Oh, sure, of course, right this way. Oh, excuse me. So. You want my help, don't you? Well, Abby did design this clue for you. It's gotta be by our old photo booth. We used to hide mascara and lip gloss back there so come on, I'll show you. Down here? Yeah, I think so. What? You found it. I think this one belongs to me. One for our funny brainiac of the pack, counting stars as we planned a big escape always takes me back. What's she saying? There were a few places we did this at, I mean it really could be any one of them. 'Kay, great, well after we're done here, we'll go check them out. Sure, oh shoot, I have lunch with my mother, but we'll go afterward. Oh, hey, Carly, can I borrow you for a second? Sure. We're going to taste test my cake. Would you mind doing the honors? Yeah, sure no problem. And hey, you know, I just wanted to say sorry about earlier, I don't want to tell you what to do, okay? You should go see Abby's parents. And tell them I said hi. Thanks, Rose. And, it's nice seeing you and Shane spending time together, and you shouldn't feel bad about it, just because Abby dated him, too. I can see that you guys have something. I mean, I never felt bad about me and Chase, even though they dated before. You never worried that Abby and Chase might wanna patch things up? No, why would I have thought that? I don't know. I guess I just thought it got a little weird there at the end with you and him and her, but my mistake. He never thought of leaving me for her, if that's what you thought. You just, still seem so bothered about the night that Abby died. What happened that bothers you so much, Rose? Just felt bad. Buying those pills. I know that I didn't make very good decisions back in school, but I really am trying to be a better person now. Oh, by the way, did you take the coroner's report from my room last night, the one I got from your dad's office? What? Of course not, I didn't even know you'd taken it. Why? Her folks had a right to know how she died, Rose. We all did. I can't change the past, Carly. Now I've gotta get back outside. Damn it. Hello? Who's there? Carly, it's me, oh my God. Are you okay, what's going on? There was a, someone was trying to kill me. What? Are you sure? They were trying to attack me back there. Well, did you see who it was? No, they were wearing the suit... The gardening suit? Yeah, I'm not making this up. Okay, let me call someone on duty and I'll have you file a report. No, I don't want to do that right now. I'm gonna call a cab. Yeah, okay, I'll take you home, of course. Come with me. We have lunch with your mom and I'm gonna get out of here. No, no, no you shouldn't be alone, okay, I can take you. You sure? Of course, of course, yes. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on. So, where do you wanna go? Abby's house. Guys, you have no idea how good it is to see you. Bill was bummed he couldn't get off work to come. Oh, that's all right. So what about you then? How's the photography going? Yeah, it's good. That's great. And what about you, Shane? Last time I saw your mom she was telling me you were writing and teaching training in France? Yeah, it's been an adventure. Sounds like it. Abby would have been so jealous of you seeing the world. Yeah. And the other girls? Are they here, too? Would have been nice to see them. Rose is always in such a hurry now. Yeah. Yeah, they're all here. We're actually staying at her parent's estate house right now. Oh no, I remember the days when you girls used to have sleepovers there. Sounds like a recipe for disaster. Yeah, sounds about right. So, we actually wanted to ask you ask you something. About a necklace that Abby would have worn around graduation time. Yes. She told me you gave it to her as a graduation gift. I did. Do you still have it, by chance? Oh no. I'm so sorry. We left it on Abby at the funeral. I thought you'd want her to be buried with it. You meant so much to her. That's perfect. Barely remember that day, it's such a blur. But thank you. You know I'm kinda surprised Abby didn't give anyone an extra key. You think there might be one in all her old junk out in the barn loft? I don't know, it's a possibility. We could go check if you wouldn't mind. Of course not. Okay, shout if you need anything. Thank you! So, why didn't you tell me that you went traveling the world? I don't know, just didn't feel right at the time. Wow, Shane, and all those times that we talked about it, and you went and did it. You ever thought about it? No. Freelance work would be there when you got back, and the experience could change your life. Yeah, or I could deplete all my savings and ruin my entire career. But you're young enough you could start over. Look, hey, it's one decision. Doesn't have to be your last. See, like that. That was a decision. I'm sorry was that wrong of me? Um it's just you were Abby's boyfriend. I don't know. The timing was bad back then, yeah, I get it. Doesn't have to be anymore. Let's go and check this place out. All I see down here is a bunch of sharp objects. Yeah, well keep looking. It's a tiny silver key, it's probably on a chain. Shane, I found something. Shane, I found my clue! It was here in the barn, this must've been one of the places Patty was talking about. Shane, Shane come up, come up here. Shane? Shane? Thank you. All right, just start from the beginning. What do you remember? Okay, I was in the loft and Shane stopped responding so I crawled down to check on him and someone grabbed me from behind. They were wearing that gardening suit from your house. And it was the same person that attacked me this afternoon. Okay, then, Shane, where were you while all of this was going down? I was just walking around looking through all the stalls and then bam, somebody hits me over the head and I didn't wake up until you found me. Well, you're both gonna have to fill out a report. Carly, on earlier today, as well. Tonight we'll keep a look out on the house, make sure everything's safe, but just, you know, why were you guys in the barn to begin with? They were looking for that capsule key. I don't suppose you found it? I did find our last clue. But it's gone. That psycho took it from me. Who is it? It's me, open up already. Hey. Where have you been? I told you I was meeting with my mom. And then Erica got really upset about her whole husband drama, so I took her to get mani pedi's for tomorrow. Carly, what is this? You have a knife? Shane and I were attacked at Abby's parent's house today. What do you mean attacked? The same person that came after me in the suit, came after me again with a garden claw. Why didn't call me earlier? We called Chase. But by the time that he had arrived, the person was gone. You okay? Shane is okay? I mean, yeah, he got knocked out on the barn floor. But, it's not him that they're after. It's me. What were you doing in some barn? Looking for the capsule key at Abby's house. I found my clue. Oh my gosh, of course, that's it. Every time I fought with my mom, she'd quit her job, or found a new man, I would go stay with Abby and we would sleep up there in that loft, and we would talk about leaving this town, and never coming back. What did the clue say? I never saw it. Whoever came after me took it. And you didn't see their car, or anything? No. So, did you get everything taken care of this afternoon? Yeah. What happened, are you all right? Looks like I'm not gonna make the reunion. Bobby's insisting that I come back tomorrow night for that event. What, you can't leave, tell him no. I can't Rose. Before I came here I found out that I can't have kids. Honey, that's awful. What about adoption? A climbing congressman without a proper blood line, come on, he wants his kids, he made that very clear. Then he doesn't deserve you. And it's my fault I can't have kids, Rose, you know that. Even still, it'll be okay. We'll get through this. Okay. I don't think I can say goodbye to the girls like this. Stop, stop, I'll make up something. Okay. You know, I was thinking. Maybe we should just, maybe we should tell 'em the truth about everything, you know? No, no. Absolutely not, you will not tell anyone, anything. We swore, nothing. You understand me. I'm sorry, yeah. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go pack and leave first thing in the morning. Okay, that's fine, you should just get some rest now. Okay. And hey, I'm gonna miss you, bestie. A final clue for my bestie to take you all to our buried treasure. Where we took our first photo by waters pure and clean. Now dirtied by our hopes and fears forever. Mmm, good to see you're still with us. Oh, come on, too soon? Sorry, sorry. You think maybe you could not wear that around us? Where is everyone, it's so quiet? Rose went to Marigold's to meet the caterer, and make sure that the food was fine. Shane was up early, so he went with her. I'm just finishing stuff up outside. And Erica? Mmm, I think she's gone. What? Her stuff was gone when I walked by her room. No, it isn't right, Patty. Erica wouldn't just leave like this. And she's not answering, ugh. Okay, you know what, that's it, we're going home. We're packing up and we're leaving. We can't just leave, Patty. No? What's it gonna take, Carly? You're room was ransacked. You were stalked and nearly attacked by some freak in a hooded suit and now one of our friends has mysteriously vanished. And you're just, what, hoping it'll all go away? Can't just give up like this. You're wrong, Carly. We have never been further from solving this, than right now. That last clue was taken from you, remember? Look, it's over. Whether you wanna believe it or not. Hey, guys. Just talked to Rose. Apparently Erica went back to D.C. for some event with her husband. Said to tell you she said bye. So she's okay? Oh, thank God. Oh my God. Yeah, why wouldn't she be? Look, whoever was screwing with you this week is probably long gone by now. I mean, no one came after you last night, right? So, we should all just go to the reunion, and have fun. Rose worked really hard on putting this together. Thanks, Chase, but you know what? I think we're just gonna head home. This weekend has been a bit too much for Carly... No, Chase is right, we should just stop by, I mean... Thank you. Hey guys, it's about time you got here. If I could just get you to sign the guest book right here please, and Carly, can I get you to take some photos for the website? Sure. Thank you. I am going to go get us some drinks. That is the only way I'm going to survive today. Yeah. Hey. You two really are cute, aren't ya? I guess it all worked out for him in the end, huh? Abs bein' gone now. Better late than never, I suppose. What are you talking about? Come on, we all know that he only dated Abby to get closer to you. And we both know that she only dated him to get back at me. God, Shane would have ditched Abby in a heartbeat to be with you, but hey, now he doesn't have to. If anyone was causing problems in that relationship did you ever think it might be you? Why couldn't you just move on. You had Rose. Fine, you want the truth? Abs and I secretly started being friends again senior year. She was helping me on my history paper, and like a week or so before graduation, she told me she was still in love with me. And wanted to work things out. I didn't love her anymore. I said no. No, because A, Abby wouldn't have done that to Rose. And B, we all had plans to move to the city together after graduation, so why would she want to work things out with you, she knew you'd stay. Oh, sweet Carly. Only sees the pretty picture behind the lens. I always loved that about you. You know, I loved Abby too, but even Abby knew she wasn't perfect, why do you put her on this pedestal? She wouldn't have lied to me. Maybe she didn't. Maybe you're just lying to yourself. I don't know. What was all that about? Chase says there's a bunch of things that I don't know about Abby, and that Shane only dated her to get closer to me, and it's absurd. Well, it's really not that absurd. Watching you and Shane and Abby tiptoe around each other the last two years of school was kinda the most awkward thing ever. If I'd have known Abby was gonna read those confessions I wouldn't have chosen the one that I did. Which was? I admitted to being in love with Shane. So when Abby said that she felt everyone wanted her dead, she was talking about me, too. Carly, no, that is not true. You're a really good friend to Abby. She knew that, you do not need to feel guilt over her death. Looking back, I think we all realized bearing those secrets might have been the best idea. Yeah. May I have your attention please? And welcome to Harmony High's 10 year high school reunion! It's hard to believe that it's been 10 years since we graced the halls of Harmony High in our knee-length skirts and pressed polo shirts, but boy have we come a long way, huh? You know what, I don't want to talk to Shane, it's too much, I just wanna get out of here. Is that okay? Those are the best words I've heard all weekend. Yes, come on. Please, make sure you sign the guest book before you leave. What's with the bouquets? Can we stop by Abby's grave on the way out? Please? I need to say bye. Do you remember where it is? It's that way. Hey, do you mind if I? Oh, yeah, sure go ahead. I'll be right here. So you weren't perfect? None of us are. You were my best friend, that's all that matters. I just wanna put the rest of these by my mom's grave. Hey, mom, let's get you fixed up. Wait, there's something else in here. What is it? It's from Abby. It's a clue. I thought there were only four? Maybe this wasn't part of the hunt. Maybe this was for me. Abby knew that I'd come here after graduation, after she died, I never did. Maybe this is my graduation gift. Happy graduation, bestie! On this necklace you will find first, an extra key to our capsule. And just know, if I'm not invited back to Rose's for the reunion, X marks the spot to finding our capsule. Also on this necklace is a very special amulet. It's your grad gift. Now to the random eye, the dancing numbers and letters mean nothing at all, but for you it's the latitude and longitude of Harmony, so you can always find your way back home to me. When you get to the city, take care of Shane. You and him should take a chance. See what happens, I know how you feel about him, and I realize what I did to him is unforgivable. Miss you already, XO. Wait, what is she talking about? I don't understand. Abby wasn't moving away with me? Did you know about this? I had no idea. What did she do to Shane? What if it was Shane all along? If Abby did something unforgivable. You really think Shane would have drugged her? I don't know. But, it would make more sense that he attacked me in the barn over someone else. But I thought you said he was knocked out? So he says? We were separated. And in all honestly, he could have been in the kitchen yesterday, too. Okay, well none of that matters now, Carly, okay. Look, if you wanna talk to the cops about it, let's just do it on the road, okay? I really wanna pack up and get out of here. Come on. Lock your door, lock your door. What happened, you guys just took off without saying bye. What's wrong? What did Abby do to you that was so unforgivable, Shane? And why'd you lie about it? So you think I killed Abby? And that I'm the one who attacked you, Carly. Did you? No, that's ridiculous. Okay, Carly, I've been the one trying to help you. Or you were trying to get closer to her to silence her. Look, would you just, okay I know how much you love Abby. I didn't want to say anything that would make her look bad, okay? It's in the past now, would you please just open the door? Open the door. Just go, Patty. Hey, this is Erica, leave me a message. Hey, Adam's Hotel in D.C. please. Hello, could I speak to Congressman Jackson's wife? I believe she's at a dinner event there. Would you mind, it's kind of important. Thank you. She didn't? Thanks. Would you believe spilled wine all over my dress? Hey, where've you been? You weren't leaving? Yeah, sorry, Rose, you know Carly really wants to head home and honestly, I can't really blame her. So you were just gonna leave without even saying good bye? Geez, Patty, some friends you are. Rose, for the record, I know you were the one who gave me the nickname Ratty-Patty back in school. So don't stand there and argue you with me about what makes a good friend. Now if you'll excuse me, we're in a hurry. Geez, why can't anyone just let things go? I'm sorry, I didn't know it would become a thing. Everything you did became a thing. If you wore a thong, as a necklace it would have been a thing. You knew what you were doing. You just didn't care. Now move, please! Hey, I'm a different person now, Patty. Why are you and Carly so obsessed with the past anyway? Can't we just move on from high school? Rose, look at me, I did move on. And last time I checked, you're the only one still in school. Carly, what are you doing? You tried this once already, remember? There's blood on this shovel, Rose. Blood? Did Erica make it back to D.C.? Did you talk to her? No. Well, at least it's not Erica. Wait, where did you find the key? Abby left one, on my mother's grave. Along with a note saying she did something unforgivable to Shane. I think it might be Shane that poisoned Abby. What, Shane? Oh my God. Shane what? Carly would you just talk to me? Hey, you found the time capsule. You just stay back, Shane. Guys, I didn't do anything okay, I swear. If you didn't do anything than why is there blood on my shovel, Shane? What is it? What? Erica's dead! What? Don't act like you don't know! You just bashed him over the head. We need to call 911. He needs an ambulance. Why are you looking at me like that, screw Shane. He killed Erica, I had to do something. Someone killed Erica. You couldn't possibly think it was me? I do. Whoa, Patty, put down the gun. Sure, when the county cops arrive. Rose has the bloody gardening suit in the back of her car, Carly. What? What, I do not. I was just there, Rose, I saw it with my own eyes. Well, if it's there it's because Shane put it there. Please, you are so full of it. Drop the shovel, and step away from Carly. Patty, I didn't do anything, I swear. Shane is trying to frame me. We'll let the cops decide that, drop the shovel! Come with me. Carly, come on. Carly, we'll call someone for him, come on! I get it, okay, I'm not going anywhere. Just get the gun off me. This is Abby's. My big confession is that I slept with Chase one night after helping him study for his history test. The truth is, I'm still in love with him, but I know in my heart that we aren't right. He and Rose are. I'm so sorry for what I did, and that's why I'm staying at Harmony to try and make amends with Rose and let Shane move on. Hopefully with Carly. It's also why I purposely failed my calculus final, so soon everyone will find out, I'm not valedictorian after all, but Patty will be. And she'll still get that scholarship and finally be able to go to Carlson now with Carly like she always dreamed. I just hope by the time we open these, Rose will have forgiven me, you too, Car. I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth. You knew she slept with Chase. That's why you poisoned her to death. I didn't kill Abby. I was framed. Shane could have just as easily killed her, he had just as good of a reason, if not better. She cheated on him. I don't believe that, Rose. Why not? Because Shane loves me. In all fairness, we should read the other confessions. Your turn, Rose. If you did kill Erica to cover your secret, then it's only fitting you read her secret. My confession is one Rose already knows. But the truth is, I didn't get mono last August. Chett Banacheck got me pregnant, and Rose took me to get an abortion. The abortion didn't go so well. But I'm better now, and the doctor said hopefully the botched job didn't cause too much damage. You guys always helped me to stay positive, so thank you and hopefully in 10 years I will be happily married to a wonderful man I actually wanna have kids with. All my love to each of you. I didn't kill my best friend. I loved her. Sure, and we all know what a great performer you are, too. My big confession is I found out Chase slept with Abby after going through his texts a few weeks ago. And although I could kill him, and Abby right now, I still love him, so instead I used my knowledge as fire into manipulating Chase into proposing to me. This is why I'm saying good bye to my promise ring, and hello to a new engagement ring. In the end it will be for the best. Abby could never love Chase the way I do. At the same time I guess I finally understand what he and everyone else loved so much about you, Abs. And from now on I can work on being better, like you, too. Now does that sound like someone who wanted to murder Abby? I'm sorry you did just say you wanted to kill her. It was figurative, Patty. You're a lawyer, you should be smart enough to know the difference. Now since you're so sure it's me. Let's open yours. Mine and Carly's don't matter anymore. What matters right now is that you get yourself a really good lawyer, because you're gonna need one. My confession I hate you, Abby Edwards. For making valedictorian and taking my scholarship. You knew how much it meant to me. I asked you to fail one silly test, drop your GPA half a point, that's all I needed to escape this town, but you tell me it's unethical. I'll tell you what's unethical. Screwing the guy you knew your best friend is in love with or better, screwing your friend's boyfriend behind her back. Rose may be nasty, Erica shallow, and Carly naive, but at least none of them are a cheating, two-faced bitch like you. Best of luck at Carlson, Abs. And go to hell. Wow. I don't know about you, Carly, but that sure sounds an awful lot like a murderess confession to me. You're ridiculous, Rose. Yes, I was mad at her at the time, but she was my friend. I got over it, you were the backstabber back then. There wasn't even an issue between me and Abby, no one is gonna believe your ludicrous theory. I do. You knew you'd be valedictorian if Abby was gone. And that her ride to Carlson would be yours, didn't you? Carly. That's just silly. I got student loans to pay for my schooling. How? Your dad was never around, your mom never made enough to sign a promissory note. Your mom never made enough to pay rent. I'm sorry, I really can't believe that we're having this conversation right now. You were my best friend. We're supposed to stick up for each other. Why did Abby's confessional bother you so much? You know that she was gonna fail so that you could get that scholarship. That hit home, didn't it? You didn't know she'd do that for you 'cause you didn't give her the chance, you poisoned her that night. I didn't mean to do it, I swear. I didn't know that putting all those pills in her drink was gonna, I just wanted her to get sick, you know. Like ruin her graduation speech the next day or something. She ruined my life. I just wanted everyone to stop believing she was so damn perfect. I don't believe you. I was drunk and I just kept thinking what am I supposed to do? Stay in this miserable town? And end up like my awful mother? I needed that scholarship, it was everything to me. Abby didn't need that scholarship like I did! She had plenty of money, you all always had plenty of money! Fine, fine. You had a moment of drunk desperation. What about Erica? When I went to go take Erica to the salon, she must have seen that note in the back of my rental. Because it was gone afr, and by the time I realized it was gone, she'd already, she was taking the capsule out of the pond, and what choice did I have? I mean, I had to re-bury it in a place that you guys hadn't found... Snake! You had a choice! You killed my best friend! Carly, Carly, I had already put the bloody gardening suit in the back of Rose's car so she could take the blame for Erica's death. Why didn't you just believe me? Rose was awful in school, she deserves what's coming to her. Carly, Carly, you I never meant to hurt you. You should've just listened to me when I said it was time to go. Now, you're just gonna be another statistic in Rose's rampage. Hey, Patty! Where are your keys? Down on the bench. Oh, the in your trunk! Oh, she must have hit the gas tank. Where is all the stuff? We gotta get out of here! Rose! No it's no use, it's stuck. I'm not leaving you! Someone has to make sure she doesn't get away with this, okay? Get out now, you can get in the bushes and she won't see you and call for help. Go! 535 Aspen, please hurry! Hey, Patty. I thought you were dead. You killed everyone I loved. Rose wasn't even a good friend. You're sick, Patty. Or by just willing to do whatever it takes to get to the place you've all taken for granted your entire lives. What are you gonna do, Carly? Kill me? No, I'm doing exactly what you've said I should. I'm fighting for my life. We were your best friends, Patty. You and I were never best friends. I could never compete with the perfect Abby. I guess you were right about one thing. Go to hell, Patty. Shane! Ugh, it's okay, I'm all right, I'm okay. Oh my God. I'm sorry that I didn't trust you. In your defense, I told you not to. So when you lied in your capsule confession to never come back... I was afraid to tell you how I really felt.
