Hey, what are you boys doing? Little devils! Back again. Are you done? Are you still not done? You've soaked the whole damn car! C'mon, you'll flood the neighbourhood. Enough! Little devils. Let's not forget the flower. I have great news for you. The deal is ours. It was so easy. A walk in the park! Yes. As always, we had a lot of help from Ma'am. The competition? No, no. We shat on them. Call New York right away and let them know. OK, goodbye. Here you go, driver. Keep the change. Thanks. Have a good trip. Thank you. - Where are we going? - Kavaklidere, please. Sure. Hello? Yes, I just landed. More weekend hours. 8000 lira. No, this time is different. A young businessman. I'm back on the first flight on Monday. Sure, it's exhausting. Plus I have an exam on Tuesday. But then again... You can't live without money. You can handle things there, right? OK, you're wonderful. Thanks a lot. Hugs and kisses. Goodbye. Thanks. You wouldn't believe the passengers I had today. Why, what happened? Where to start? How about blackmail and rigged bids? Or the college call girl? It's all there. The country's gone off the rails. If I went public, it'd be seismic. You mean they talk about this stuff in front of you? Yes. Some talk to me and some act like I'm not even there. They get out their cell phones and talk for hours. Suppose we put a spy camera in the car and record everything? Why? We could make news. We could expose them all. I did a story once. On a rigged bidding process. Next day, they fired me from the newspaper. Bastards! I've always wanted to get my own back. Wait. I've a friend who knows about these things. I'll ask him. Don't be daft. I'd get in trouble. Anyway, isn't it illegal? - Yes, it is. - See? It's definitely illegal. But so is everything in this country. Our old reporter chum wants to support freedom of information, right? - Exactly. - There you go. - So we're doing a good thing? - Definitely. You also need a camera in the car for your own security. The place is full of no-goods, don't you see? How can your hours be over? Are you public sector workers? Our arrangement with the company is to work until 5.00. So it's my fault for paying you in advance, is it? Of all the nerve! What about all this furniture? Give us 100 lira for the rest and we'll move it. - I don't understand. - I'll move the rest for 100 lira. - My hours finished at 5.00. - I'll kill you! - But.. - I'll kill you! Crooks! - Get out of here! Beat it! - OK, OK! Beat it! Get out! God damn you! Rot in hell! God damn! Get the hell out of here! God damn you... Crooks! God damn you. What's up? We're supposed to be moving and they dump half the stuff here. Animals! The so-and-sos! Don't worry. We'll give you a hand. Won't we, Adnan? - What? - We'll help, won't we? But there's so much stuff. And it's heavy. No, no. I live in the building anyway. So we're neighbours. Hello. Mehmet. I'm Melek. Nice to meet you. - I'm sorry. - No problem. Adnan, c'mon. Let's do it. Adnan, what are you doing? - Come here. - Really? - You want to start with that? - Yes, c'mon. OK - But it's so much trouble. - Don't worry. Adnan's used to it. - C'mon, let's go. - Be careful, though. The thing's empty, right? Slowly. Careful now. Stop. Stop for a second. I'm done in. Stop. Dammit, Adnan! Why the big deal over a few boxes and a washing machine? Sure, when the washing machine's the lightest thing! Move, go on! It's been so much trouble. Not at all. It was just a couple of things. We were done in 15 minutes. Right, Adnan? It was no trouble. Right. We love moving furniture anyway. We do it all the time. - Can I give you a napkin? - No, no. I'm great without one. - Let me take the glass. - Here you go. Thanks a lot. We've no idea how to thank you. Do we, Mum? No, sweetheart. No idea. No need. We should be going anyway. Shouldn't we, Mehmet? Let's be going. Yes. We couldn't offer you anything either. - No need. - Everything's all over the place. Sure. You have a lot to do. Have a nice day. Have a nice evening. - Let me see you to the door. - We'll be back if you need us. - Thanks, both of you. - Goodbye. Why not soap yourself. Yes. There we go. Let's see them talking now! OK, let's try it out. No need. See the button here? Press it once to turn the camera on and again to turn it off. It's that simple. - What if I forget? - Why would you? Just press the button before you turn on the meter. I don't feel good about it. Can I back out? C'mon, Mehmet! What did we talk about that day? But we'd be sticking a camera into people's private lives. Exactly! Of course we would. That's where the news is today! Hello. Who are you? I'm Mehmet. Your neighbour. Remember we helped move your stuff the other day? OK. You're a good person. Really? How do you know? Mum said. Most people are bad so we shouldn't trust them. But she said you were a good person. Did she? My grandma really liked you, too. She said if only you were more handsome. What does that mean? Well, that I'm handsome, but not really like a famous actor. I expect she meant something like that. Hey, doctor. Whenever I come here, you're at a table reading. Does the stuff never end? Or do you not get what's on the page? Adnan, that's out of line. My nephew is at least as smart as his uncle. I've been coming here for years... and have yet to see a glimmer of sense in you. But your nephew is smarter than you for sure. After all, he got to graduate from the school of medicine. But seriously, what are you reading? I'm reading up on pathology. - What-ology? - Pathology! Pathology! Go on, explain for him. It's the study of diseases. Of their origin and progression. A good doctor needs a good grasp of pathology. So why are you reading notes? Are there no books on it? Sure there are. But they're kind of pricey. I'm making do with notes for now. No book is more important than a pathology book. Because one of the diseases in the book is sure to come and get you. Hey, you in the uniform! Why aren't you out catching thieves? C'mon, Adnan! Don't give me thieves. You know I'm only in it for the paycheck. Besides, I haven't even held a gun since I joined the police. Adnan, I tell you what. Say a thief walked in the door. - Who'd be the first to run? - He would! Look at you people, always picking on the young! Take a look at yourselves. You still don't have a proper job at your age, for heaven's sake! Tea. Thanks. Look, this is kind of interesting. The guy's a businessman from Istanbul. He was in Ankara for a dirty weekend and spent no less than 57,000 lira. How can you spend 57,000 in a weekend? 35,000 went on a bag for the girl. Good grief! 35,000 on a bag? Sure. You don't have a clue, do you? You can get bags for 16,000 euros. I checked it out. That makes over 60,000 lira. It's pointless even discussing it. The man spent the money. Who cares? Forget it. It's tabloid news at most. It's not even that. 'Istanbul businessman blows 57,000 lira on fling with woman in Ankara…' You call that news? Fine. If you're saying it isn't newsworthy, then I'll get back to work. Hello? There's a man on the phone who insists on talking to you. He says it's about your wife and very important. About my wife? Yes. That's what he said. Put him through. OK, I'll put him through on line two. Hello? Hello. Greetings, Mr Nazmi. I'm calling about your wife's happiness. Who the hell are you? What's this about my wife's happiness? Mr Nazmi, I want to play you something. Have a listen and then we'll talk. Here you go. What was that you said? Hello? I'm on my way back. It was great. Fantastic. I say that, but... It cost me an arm and a leg. The woman liked a bag that cost 35,000 lira! Sure I got it. Nazmi Temizeller puts his money where his mouth is. Put it this way, the weekend set me back 57,000. Sure it was worth it. Worth every cent. The dame was sexy as hell. C'mon, you only live once. Hello? Yes, Mr Nazmi. What's this about? What's up? You don't sound too happy. Asshole! Are you trying to blackmail me? Not at all! We're talking an exchange, not blackmail. We want something from you and you from us. It's that simple. Look, you've got the wrong guy, OK? I'm not the kind to give in to blackmail. - Asshole! - If you just listen to To what? Listen to what? What is this? Now look, Mr Nazmi. For the sake of you, your wife, and the entire country's happiness... We want to sell you the tape you just heard for 57,000 lira. What do you say? I wouldn't give you 57 kurush, dammit! OK? You've got the wrong guy. You have no idea. I'll do you in. OK? Where are you? Tell me where you are. Calm down, Mr Nazmi! What's to get uptight about? It's only 57,000 lira. A weekend's spending, as we just heard. Let's us get the money, you the tape and everyone will be happy. Don't you agree? How the hell am I supposed to trust you? For goodness sake, Mr Nazmi! I didn't say 570,000 lira. We only want 57,000 from you. It'll all go to charity anyway, believe me. I'll send a donation receipt if you like and you can take it off your tax bill. Mr. Mehmet! Hello. Having a good day? Yes, thank you. Thanks. You went to so much trouble for us, I wanted to thank you. Not at all. We're neighbours, aren't we? Thank you. I was going to say... I'm making stuffed eggplant tonight. - Will you come over? - Sure. Why not? Tonight? Yes. Why not bring along your friend? OK. What time should we come? At dinner time. Let's say 7.30. Is that OK? Sure. We'll be there. In that case... See you tonight. OK. Have a nice day. God damn it! Why do I have to cut myself today of all days? I look like a sacrificial sheep. Hello, good evening. Hello, good evening. Yes. Hello, good evening. - Welcome! Come in. - Hello. Come on in. I've only one pair of men's slippers. How are we going to work that? We umm... Adnan! We got you some flowers. Thank you very much. That's so kind. Thanks. Please, go on through. Let me get your shoes, Adnan. Thanks. Are any of those slippers any good? These are fine. I'm sorry. Keep going to the left. It was all amazing. I haven't had such nice food in ages. Glad you enjoyed it. I didn't do a thing, though. My daughter here made everything. She's so capable. She makes baklava, bakes pastries, I've even seen her preparing kebabs. Her cooking is made in heaven! I hope you liked it. Now, if you'll excuse me... Why? Where are you going? My TV series is on. Soaps are everything for people my age. And tonight's episode is so exciting. There's a boy who clearly loves the girl. He has a baby face, he's a good person, unselfish, caring, friendly. Like you, he's fair with blue eyes. He has your hair, too! Anyway, he likes the girl. As for the girl... she's a sourpuss and pretends to know nothing. But I'm sure there'll be some action tonight… In the series. Go on, Mum. It's starting. OK. You make some tea, OK? - Will you have some tea? - Sure. We drink 30 glasses a day. - OK, I'll put the tea on then. - Thanks. - Don't worry about that. - No problem. - Here you go. - Thanks very much. What's with the 30 glasses of tea? Listen. All that spiel about the soap. - It's looking good, huh? - What? Don't you get it? Oh, c'mon! Don't be ridiculous, Adnan. Listen. I'll go if you want. - Go where? - Sure. I'll just say I have to watch the football. No. Don't leave me here on my own. Forgive me if I ask something. Was Meryem... born with sight problems? We tried for a baby for a long time. We went from doctor to doctor. There isn't a consultant we didn't see. So then... when Meryem was born, we were overjoyed. She was such a beautiful baby. Mum says she was struck by the evil eye because she was so beautiful. We didn't realize at first. It was Mum who did. Meryem wasn't looking at us. She must've been four months. She isn't actually blind. She can see light. She can do simple things by herself. So she can eat. But... no way can she read, for example. You know she wears those dark glasses? She has to wear them. Because her eyes are super-sensitive to the light. Also... if I don't speak, she doesn't recognize me. When we found out about all this, her father walked out. Then again... we didn't exactly marry for love. It was our families who arranged it. He was my first cousin. When he left, the whole family turned their backs on us. They dropped us just like that. Whatever we'd done to upset them... whatever we'd done wrong. So Mum, me and Meryem... we found ourselves all on our own. Luckily, we have Mum's widow's pension.. And I make a little money from sewing and dressmaking. So... we try to survive on that. How about some more tea? Anyone can say what they like... but the sound and smell of money are something else, guys. We shafted the man. Forget it. He's rich anyway. He probably makes and loses 10, if not 100 times 57,000 every day. - Had your fill of money, have you? - No. What are we going to do with the money? I don't know. I've never seen so much money all at once. Let's go for a decent kebab first. I know a great place. The food is said to be awesome. “Said to be”? You haven't been to the place? No. Didn't have the means. - People sure know the good life. - Good evening. Welcome. - Are there three of you? - What's the name? Haci. Now Haci. Let me say we're no strangers to kebabs. My friends and I want to dine well and have a few drinks. So let's make a deal up front. How do you mean, sir? What kind of tips do you get? I'm not with you. My point is, what's the biggest tip you've ever had here? Some people sometimes leave 50 lira. Fifty? Look, here's 200 lira. Go on, take it and let's be done with this. Just for once, my friends and I are having a night out on the town. Now, show me the nicest table. Make it somewhere quiet where we can talk in private. Look at you, pal! OK, it's not done to count, but... that's your third helping! - Don't get indigestion. - Third? I thought it was my fifth! Here's an honest 50 lira for you! Thanks a lot, sir. See you again. Good night. There we go. Mehmet, why are you stopping? Is there a problem? Adnan. Did you just tip the waiter 200 lira and the car park attendant another 50? Yes. What's the problem? I tell you, all this money will lead us astray. C'mon, Mehmet. We kicked up our heels for one night. Are three kebabs and a couple of rakis going to corrupt us? Are we that spineless? OK, but... what are we doing when so many people we know need money? Just throwing it around. Halil. Guys, Halil is in a really bad spot. - OK, so there's Halil. - He hasn't paid rent for three months. And his landlord is threatening to throw him out. But, guys... I can't go offering Halil money. He's so proud. He'd not only refuse it, he'd tell me where to go, too. Wait. We'll find a way. Who's going? I'll do it. The guy's an idiot! A total idiot! If he can't see the money right under his nose... of course he can't make ends meet! Oof, Halil! - Wait, I'll take care of it. - What an idiot! What are you doing? Hah! A balloon. An old trick. What old trick? Just watch. The door! The door! That's all there is to it. I will do two extra services for you if you try it. Mehmet, c'mon. Let's go. Mehmet? Let's get a headstone made for Hasan now. Now look, Mehmet. Hasan has two well-off siblings. Is it really our job? He's right. Hasan's been dead two years and they've yet to do anything. Wasn't he our closest friend? So it's our job to get that headstone made. That's true. You're right. OK, guys, leave it with me. I'm sorry. - OK. - I agree, you're right. - Now let's go. - Look, this money isn't really ours. So let's set up a fund. And we'll give handouts to whoever needs it. If we put it in the bank, we'd get interest. We'd what? Who got it? Are you guys colour blind? What's this stage costume, huh? Give it here, idiot. What do you know? - Is it yours? - Yes. - Get some purple trousers to go with it. - Sure. Do we really need so many clothes? Go ahead. Be a killjoy! But what are we doing? We're sure to be led astray. What are you talking about? Why'd buying two shirts lead us astray? Who do you think we are? And if it makes you feel better... we can always spend the money on more necessary things. Why? Because we now have the means. OK, gentlemen, enjoy! A treat from our sponsor, Mehmet. This is the pathology book you wanted, isn't it? Thanks a lot, Uncle. Thanks a lot. You didn't have to. We're investing in the future. So you don't kill us when we get sick or old. Take Mehmet here. He's already showing symptoms. He's in a cold sweat, he's deathly pale. So go on, see what his prognosis is. Tea is on the house. C'mon, gentlemen. Dig in, please. Mehmet, son. What's the story here? I had an uncle in Sinop. He just passed away. - God rest his soul. - Thanks. He didn't have kids... so he left what he had to me. Talk about luck. I have five uncles... and they're all stone-broke. In the old days, money used to smell. You know? What did it smell like? It stank! There weren't many banknotes then. They got dirty changing hands. And people carried their money in their trouser pockets. It made my stomach turn. I didn't want to touch the stuff. No one gave much importance to money in those days. There wasn't much to buy anyway. Now everything is for sale. Even people. - Seda. - Yes, Professor? Remember that pretty girl we examined yesterday? Have you written up her telescopic glasses report? The report's ready, but I'm not sure they can pay the patient contribution. I guess they don't have a lot of money. Then we'll pay for it through the association. OK. But we must get her fixed up before the schools start. Or it'll vindicate those who want her at a blind school. Sure, Professor. I'm so sorry, could I ask a question? Of course. Go ahead. There's a girl in my neighbourhood. She was also told she should go to a blind school. Could she go to normal school with those glasses? What do you say? It's possible, but we'd need to examine her. - OK. - How old is she? Six. That's the ideal age. Let me give you my card. Tell her father to call for an appointment. Hello. Halil... Welcome. Thanks. You want some tea? No, thanks. I must get home. I thought I'd call in on my way. - No time even for a tea? - No, thanks. OK. The other night I saw you outside our house. I really don't know how to thank you. I was in such a tight spot. Everyone I owe was circling like vultures. I even considered suicide at one point. I was desperate. I'd like to return the favour someday. If you're ever in trouble... don't hesitate to come knocking. Catch me! Catch me! - Who have I got here? - The blind girl. Never say 'the blind girl' again. Catch me, catch me. Careful. Guys, Auntie Melek is here! Where? Off you go and eat those pastries. Not so fast! Careful now. Or they'll stick in your throat. How's it going? I thought the kids might be hungry. I wanted to ask, is there any chance of leaving 30 minutes earlier tomorrow? I mean if it's OK with you. Sure. Anyway, I'm not working tomorrow. Do you think it'll help? Sure. You should've heard the doctor in the taxi. They were all set to send this girl to a blind school... but with telescopic glasses she was able to go to normal school. - Really? - Yes. Let's hope. Can you bring the bill? OK? It's on the house today. - Mehmet. - No, c'mon. Bring me the bill. Bring Mehmet a tea instead. Mehmet, I wanted a word with you about something. Go ahead. I hear you've come into an inheritance. Is that right? Yes. I had an uncle in Sinop. When he passed away... I inherited a small amount. God rest his soul. - My condolences. - Thanks. Mehmet, business is dire at the moment. Could you give me a small loan? Sure. How much? 3000 lira. Is that OK? Yes. But I don't have it on me right now. I'll drop it off tonight, OK? Of course, Mehmet. Thanks. Bless you. I'll pay you back very soon. - Just get things worked out first. - Thanks. If you'll excuse me then. No. This is separate. Ankara University School Of Medicine Low Vision Rehabilitation Centre Now, Meryem, I want to try out some glasses on you. So, if you look at the wall again. I can see! What? Can she really see? Yes, if she says she can. Honey, can you see? I can see. - Can she really see? - Of course she can. Can she really see? Let's take these glasses off. Nurse, can you take Meryem to the playroom? Then you and I can have a chat. Please, be calm. - Up you get now. - Can she really see? - Will I be getting those glasses? - Yes. - Can she really see now? - Yes, she can. - Doctor, can she really see? - Yes. I can't believe it. Now, these telescopic glasses are especially important... in that they allow her to go to a normal school with her age group. She'll be able to see the blackboard and read for herself. Then later on, she'll be able to lead an independent life... and have a career. For all this to happen, we'll need to work closely with you and her teacher. I don't believe it. Thank you so much, doctor. In you get, sweetie. Careful now. Hello. - You're wearing make-up. - Grandma made her. She said, “Mr Mehmet won't fancy you if you look pasty-faced like that.” What kind of nonsense is that? She's making it all up. She imagines things sometimes. It suits you, though. Thank you. What's up? What else? Meryem is playing up again. She's giving the nurses a hard time. She won't do anything they say. She's mad at you. That's probably why. She's mad at me. Who else would she be mad at? Miss Meryem would only be mad at me. Who brought her into the world? I did. And now I have to pay the price. Right? I brought her into the world so I must pay the price. I'm the guilty one. I'm to blame for everything. It wasn't me who was forced to marry my cousin. It wasn't me who was forced to intermarry. It wasn't me, aged 16, who said I wanted to study, not marry... who was flogged on the back, caned on the soles of my feet... locked up in dark rooms and beaten. No, that wasn't me. I'm so tired. No one knows what I've been through. No one even cares. Everyone just thinks of themselves, you know? Sometimes I think I'd rather be dead. But I don't even have... the right to die. Even death is a freedom, you know? Who would I leave my old mother with? Who'd look after my little girl? I just want a little appreciation. Everything's getting on top of me. Everything and everyone. I'm so tired. Just now... Just now the doctor told me off. She said Meryem had trouble seeing, not hearing and told me not to shout. I was so embarrassed. Forgive me. I'm kind of a nervous wreck. I'm so sorry. What are you reading? Sait Faik. His short stories. Do you really like reading? Yes, I love it. I didn't get to finish high school... but... I've never stopped reading. Why didn't you finish high school? Was it money problems or something? No, money was never really a problem. It was snow that stopped me finishing high school. What has snow got to do with it? Snow was to blame. I was in first grade of high school... and it started snowing one day. It doesn't usually snow much back home. With the excitement of it snowing, everyone was at the windows... and everyone was shouting, “It's snowing!” Our teacher was a sullen so-and-so. He said, “So what if it's snowing?” And I said... But it's sticking, sir! Everyone started laughing. The teacher yelled at everyone to return to their places. Then he turned to me... and gave me this horrific look. It was so bad. From then on, the teacher had it in for me. I never got a pass grade after that. Is that really why you left high school? Yes. Because of the snow. Since then... whenever it snows, I'm reminded of that teacher's terrible face. That's why I hate snow. If it hadn't snowed that day... and I.. Hadn't said, “But it's sticking, sir...” Maybe everything would've been different. If something's destined to happen, it'll happen. There's no escape. Sometimes. Things are going great. The country's booming and bountiful. You think we should buy some dollars? Where do you get that idea? It's just people are saying the dollar will go up. So how about we open a currency exchange place as well? Hey, OK. I was just throwing it out there. Guys. Can I keep this envelope? Why? What's up? Remember Meryem? Melek's daughter. I want to pay the patient contribution for her telescopic glasses. But Melek doesn't know. You see what I mean? - So is that a yes? - OK. Thank you. Life's a bitch. I could've done with this money ten years ago. Why? What was going on ten years ago? Nothing. C'mon, there was something. No, I just said it without thinking. What happened? C'mon! Talk to us. You'll feel better. There was this girl. Ten years ago. I'd have married her if I'd had money. But I didn't. She went and married some rich idiot. But she wasn't happy going. There were a lot of tears. There was nothing I could do. Why? Because I had no money. There you go. Hey, Mehmet. I keep meaning to ask. Why do the neighbourhood kids always pee on your tyres? That's kids for you. Someone said to them... “If you pee on the tyres it'll bring fortune and prosperity.” And they believed it. So every morning... they stick a flower in the windscreen wipers... and then pee on the tyres. It's not like I mind. Right. It works if you ask me. - How do you mean? - Look how things have taken off. Tell them to keep peeing. In fact, why don't I join them? No, you stay away. Nice job, Metin. It's beautiful. Good, isn't it? Matt. The most expensive marble. The shape is great, too. It's different. Do you think Hasan can hear us? Yes. He can definitely hear us. Can you hear him? Where the hell were you? Why weren't you picking up? You crashed the car. Great! And you hit a military van. God damn you! I'll take it off your wages. Stay out of my sight! Yes, Ma'am? But, Ma'am... It's not my fault, Ma'am. The guys had an accident. They crashed the car. Driver, can you pull over? Can you stop for a minute? - Are you getting out? - I'll check right away, Ma'am. Can you give me a minute in the car? Can you get out? I'll check right away, Ma'am. Just a second. - You want me to get out? - Yes. Please. I'll check right away. OK. Mum, you love me more now I that can see, don't you? Sweetheart. You don't say that! I love you so very much. I don't believe it. This dossier would topple the government. So is the stuff in here true? What if it's just a conspiracy? I don't know, but if it's true... True or false, we have the dossier now, right? So let's take advantage of it. We don't want to get in deep water. Like how? Suppose the man realizes he left the dossier in the taxi? Wait. Who is this guy? Show me in that footage here. - I guess that's not him. - No, it isn't. - That's not him. Keep going. - I'm fast-forwarding. Wait, stop. That's him. Him? I've seen that guy on TV. That's good. He'll be easy to find. But who was he? Look at the scandals this country's seen and nothing ever changes. Let's think. Think about what? I'm telling you, it's asking for trouble. If the dossier is so precious, they'll pay money for it. And be more than happy to pay for it. Just calm down. I say we do this: Let's wait a while. Let's see if anyone asks you about it, then we'll act. I say we burn the dossier, end of discussion. OK, fine. I see. The dossier is shelved for now. OK? Is everyone calm? Tea? Hello there. Welcome. How can I help? I wanted to look at wedding rings. What kind of thing do you want? Something simple. Of course. How's this? Can I see the partner to this? Sure. Here you are. They look great together. I hope it's a long and happy marriage. Well... I'd love to get them, but... I need a few months. So let's leave it for now. Look, my friend. If you want them so much, get them. Some things in life should never be put off. When I was your age, I decided to wait a little longer. I've never got to wear a wedding ring. Enter! What is it? Ma'am. You know the missing dossier? Someone called to say he'd give it back for 57,000 lira... otherwise he'd give it to the press. What did you say? I told him to call back in one hour. Then I hung up. Good for you. If you found a dossier like that, would you give it back for 57,000 lira? What he's asking is on the low side. Either he's a halfwit who has no idea what's in his hands... or he has other intentions. Get the money together. Arrange a meeting. And when you've got the dossier... destroy both the guy and everyone in his family. Yes, Ma'am. Look what I have to deal with. What imbecile wanted a dossier like that to be put together? You. It was you, Ma'am. Go. Get out. Seyranbaglari Mosque. Is this bag yours? Thank you. - May God accept your prayers. - Yours, too. In the name of God, the Gracious, the Merciful. Here he is. - How's it going? - Mehmet. We must be in the Botanical Park at 3.00. - Why? - To pick up a payment. A payment of 57,000 lira no less. Why 57,000 lira? 57,000 is our lucky number. OK. Tea? Not for me. I'm not coming. You guys go. C'mon! Don't be afraid, I'll be there. We'll go together... leave an envelope in the garbage, take the envelope for us... and go back to the taxi. It's that simple. - OK. - There's nothing to worry about. What's going on with you? I'm off to the town hall. It won't take half an hour. Hobble in and you get seen right away. What's the point in queuing for hours? I'll be back in half an hour. What's he playing at? Isn't that plain dishonest? Isn't he deceiving people? Isn't that shameful? You're right, Adnan. It's all of those. Adnan. What are we doing here? - How much further is it? - Like you've walked miles. Patience! We walked into a trap. Go that way. I'll pretend to be blind. - Quick! I'll explain. - Explain what, Adnan? - Who are those guys? - Move! I said I'll explain. - No one's following us, are they? - No, Adnan. Let's go. God damn you. - Are we being followed? - There's a man to the left. What does he look like? We weren't going to touch that dossier! Sorry! I gave in to temptation. OK. This whole thing ends here! No more camera, no more tapes! Put your seat belt on. No one turned up. We were there for an hour. Did you see anything out of the ordinary? A dog attacked two of our guys. So they had to leave their hiding place. No one else showed up. Is that right? A young couple had a fight in front of us. The girl started beating up the guy. We had a hard time rescuing him! Anyone else? An old woman was walking her dog. And there was a blind man with someone else. Wait. Describe the guy with the blind man. What did they do? They walked past us and left the park. Then they got in a taxi and drove away. Did they hail a passing taxi or take their own? They took their own. Did the blind man drive or the other guy? I didn't notice. I don't remember. Idiot! They're who we're looking for. Find them for me fast! Enter! Ma'am, the man we're looking for is a taxi driver. He showed up today as agreed, but must have suspected something... because he left the park without taking the cash. Get rid of all taxi drivers. But, Ma'am, there are 7800 taxis in Ankara. Then, find the man and do away with him. Everyone get up! Stand in line! Your photos will be taken. - Who the hell are you to... - Shut your mouth! Everyone get up! Let's say the state wants your photo for its collection. Chief, how do we know you're police? The hell we're police! Chief, we accept anything the daddy-state decides. - If you like, we can do a group photo. - Shut it! Forget trawling the cab ranks, chief. The chamber of drivers has photos of all cabbies. Whoa! I think they're police and turns out they're state. That midget has a mean punch. Who's there? Me, Mehmet. Mehmet? Hello. Hello. How are you? Fine. You? I'm fine, too. I'm not disturbing you, am I? No, you aren't. Were you asleep? I was starting to get ready for bed. Umm, I just thought I'd see if you needed anything. That's why I'm here. No, there's nothing I need. I mean, everything's fine. Thanks a lot. OK then. Can I ask you something? Is it normal to hear the water pump sometimes? I guess so. Because when anyone turns on a tap... the water's pumped up from downstairs. Thanks. Then that must be why I came. You're funny. Thanks a lot. Everything's fine. I don't need anything. Thanks OK, then. Good night. Good night. Why not close the door and I'll go? No, it's OK. I'll, you know... No, go on. OK, if you say so. Good night. Why's my nephew asleep at the table? He was on call last night. He didn't get any sleep. Ass! Why not go home and sleep? He wants to watch tonight's game with us. That's why he didn't go home. I see. Football. Let's go, friend. - Climb in. - Let's go, let's go. - Let's go. - OK, let's go. Just a second. Do you have a stick in the car? - A stick for what? - Where we're going. I've some business to take care of. We're going to umm. Don't you have a stick? No. I have no use for sticks. OK, look. We'll go to Ulus. I've a score to settle there. While I'm taking care of that, you'll wait. Then... - Oh, and you can help if you want. - Help? Why not? Then there'd be more of us. Look, every driver carries a cricket bat in his car... - or a baseb... - Baseball bat. - So why don't you have one? - I just don't. A club or a stick, you know. OK, let's go. - Where are we going? - We're going to Ulus. - Ulus. - Here, look. The fare up front. OK? If it's more, I'll pay the difference. Money isn't a problem. Now let's go. - OK. - I've a small score to settle. - So you're headed for a fight. - The king of fights. - And I'm supposed to wait for you? - Yes, you wait while I settle things. - Then you'll be back? - Yes. Now let's go. - OK, let's go. - Let's go. Let's go and see what's going on. We're looking for Mehmet, the cab driver. They said we'd find him here. He's a bit late tonight, but he won't be long. Have a seat and some tea. Look, guys. How's this for a watermelon? All 16 kilos of it. Anything less is inedible anyway. We may as well sit down and have a tea. Ah! - Beat them all up, did you? - No. - No? So you forgave them? - I didn't beat them up... because no one was at the tea house. They didn't turn up today. They got away. - Or I'd have made mincemeat of them. - Right. They got away. Right. They sure were lucky. Look, I've someone waiting up for me. Let me take you home. - Where's home? - I don't have one. - So you live on the street? - Yes! On the frigging street. Because the wife kicked me out and changed the locks. And I threw away the keys. - Don't you have anyone else? - Yes, I have my lover. - OK, I'll drop you there. - No. She's getting married tomorrow. That's my whole problem. Sounds like you have your work cut out. Was it the Lycians who invented money? Or the Phrycians? Or the Phrygians? Who was it? It was the Lydians. The Lydians. Where did Phrycians come from? Look, whenever I've had money I've had problems. Whenever I've had money everyone tries to screw me See that tea house? The thing with money... Anyway, that's a long story. I lend everyone a shed load and now I can't get it back. It doesn't matter, I don't want it. But... Anyway, long story. So, look. Let's go down the hill and I'll take you somewhere. It'll blow your mind. Let me take you for a coffee first, then I'll drop you off. - OK, but then we'll go, won't we? - Sure, we'll go. The mezes are wicked. C'mon. OK, in you get. Money doesn't matter. I don't care about money. You're right. Now go on, in you get. Money, money, money. Was it Napoleon who said that? Yes, Napoleon. Money, money, money. - Yes. - Money, money, money. People are murdered and maimed for it. You may have a fortune of millions... but a shroud won't take a penny in its pockets. Greetings! Hey, doctor. You're still here at this time? Hey, OK. Get off. - C'mon. - Get off me. C'mon. Adnan! Doctor? Doctor? The watermelon... has been blown to pieces. Why keep ringing the bell like a debt collector? Can't you drop dead? Where have you been the last two days? Working for the motherland. I've barely slept two hours in two days. Take off those glasses. You look like a blind man. Not more baklava! - Dad! - Girls! Welcome home, Dad! - Can you give me a bottle of water? - Mehmet. Here. Forget the money, but go. Two guys in shades are asking after you. Everyone's scared. If the boss sees you, he'll fire me. Here, take the money all the same. Thanks. Boys, do you know this man? He's a taxi driver. No, we've never seen him. Too bad. There's a 100 lira reward for anyone who helps us find him. Do we get the reward if we find another cabbie? Who are you? Mehmet's coming. Don't let him in. We don't want trouble. Mehmet. What's going on, my friend? - Your boss doesn't want me, huh? - Sorry. Say hello from me. Goodbye. Uncle Mehmet. Two guys in shades are looking for you They have a photo of you. Thanks for telling me. It's better if we aren't seen together for a while. OK? Off you go now. We'll be back tonight, Uncle Mehmet. OK. Is there anything you want? No. But thanks a lot. They killed the girl and her grandma. The mother's injured. What do they want from these poor people? It's so weird. No one heard a thing. Who was that? - Mehmet. - What kind of guy are you? Let him in! This is our apartment block's storeroom. You can stay the night here. Mutt sleeps here, too. You can keep each other company. Mutt is a stray, but he's really well-behaved. Uncle Mehmet. Is evil contagious? No, evil isn't contagious. But don't worry. Even if it was, you wouldn't catch it. Ow! God damn you! Very interesting. Where did you find the dossier? A passenger left it in my taxi. The contents will upset a lot of people. You're aware of that, aren't you? Yes. Friends said the same thing. Friends? Friends at the tea house. All of them were killed two days ago. I heard something about a blood feud. That must've been it. Yes. Thanks. OK. Don't worry, I'll... take a closer look and do what's required. Informing the public of the truth is our number one responsibility. Thank you. May I ask you something? Is there any particular reason for bringing the dossier to this newspaper? Everyone reads your newspaper. I thought it would have more impact. Thanks. I should be going. Have a good day. Good days are a world away as far as I'm concerned. Still, thank you for listening. You're welcome. Enter! The problem of the missing dossier has been resolved, Ma'am. Nice work. Sometimes you have your uses. Ankara University School Of Medicine Ibn-i Sina Hospital I'm taking the patient to X-ray. At this time? There was a multiple car accident. X-ray has only just freed up. Melek. Melek. You don't need to come. I'll be back with the patient shortly.
