* ULZANA'S RAID * San Carlos Indians Reserve Mc Donald's! The warriors of Ulzana fled. He left the reservation. Ulzana and a handful of others are on the warpath. Ulzana... Cape Light Horse and bring it here! It's going to be hell! Ulzana leaves the reservation! I do not have the slightest desire to send many soldiers in the and his warriors. It is embarrassing when neither the agent, of the Indians know how many! There can not be many. And maybe they just go to Mexico. In between! McIntosh arrived. Let it in. Good morning, Mr. McIntosh. Good morning, Major. There was an escape from the reservation. I heard Ulzana disappeared. It was one of the names mentioned. How many more? Mr. Steegmeyer did not know for sure, It says about 6 or 7. There are not many warriors there. The coffee is hot? Help yourself! Apaches on the Warpath sometimes they come with a hundred warriors and sometimes with one. Did the major inform the settlers? How they rule. How many knights? Two. One heads north, the other to the West. How many horses? Captain Gates knows the details. How many horses Did you give them, Charlie? One each... How they rule. I know. Who sent it? Mulkearn and Horowitz. A recruit? But only recruits! I was on duty. When did they leave? At ten. Must return by the end of the afternoon. Unless they bring in settlers. The orders did not anticipate it. I understand. Ride to the agency! Maybe there you'll know more. It's ok. How many soldiers Do you want to send, Major? I only decide when I meet, the strength of the enemy. And what he intends. You want to burn, maim, torture, rape and massacre. Tell Agent Steegmeyer that I want the names of those responsible. They must not escape impunity once again. For this I need two hours. Until he returns and go to the pursuit of Ulzana, it will have four hours of advance. I do not send soldiers, if they leave me in ignorance, Sir. McIntosh I just want to be sure, that we are right behind them. "Enemies who abandon, a reservation of Indians will be persecuted and detained". We have to know how many, Mr. McIntosh. And if they have hostile intentions. The first is uncertain. As for the second you can bet. He is very direct. Is stubborn and convinced and despises any form of discipline, moral or military. It's a good guide and knows the Apaches. Which is not my case. Do you think these two will to tell something, Ke-Ni-Tay? They do not like you. He did not listen to what you say. Old Nachito does not like people. Ask them what they think of Ulzana. Ask them if he is a great warrior chief. Wiser than Nana? Braver than Boring? More cruel than Victorio? He asks them if he satisfies, his women at night. Ask them what they think. Ask them! Surely it is disillusioned, lieutenant, for having sent it, to Fort Lowell? No, sir, I wanted to go. for active duty. Your father's the clergyman, is not he? Yes, sir. And it does not sadden him, rather than your vocation be so different from his? My father thinks that if can be a Christian and a soldier. Perhaps. But I do not believe the Apaches they would accept Jesus as their great chief. Well, my father thinks, that the lack of Christian charity, is the cause of our problems with the Indians. It is easy to make this mistake from from a pulpit in Philadelphia. If you had a chance, sir, Lieutenant! Replace Captain Gates, in command of this patrol! Sir! Maybe still have, the oportunity to test the theories of his father Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Do not thank me, Lieutenant. It is not a gift. Leave as soon as Mr. McIntosh, return lieutenant. Yes, sir. He knows what General Sheridan said about this country, Lieutenant? No, sir. He said: "If I had hell and Arizona, I would live in hell and would lease Arizona". Oh, I think it was Texas, mr. Maybe, but I wanted to say Arizona. Yes, sir. They spoke. Half of what they say is a lie, the other half is not true. Tell them they speak, like true Apaches. And I'm glad you did not be on the warpath too! And I'm going to speak with Major on beef. So, McIntosh, the old Did they tell you anything? Yes, you are deceived when They weigh their flesh, Dutch. That's what all the Indians say. You can always control my balance. And I'm not Dutch. It seems to me. And I do not care about your balance. I tell you that those who stayed they wondered if it was a good idea to stay. What do you want me to do? Give them extra rations? Do not soak the meat before of spite! Can not believe how many steaks there are in 10 liters of water! Do not tell me how I should Manage My Business! This store is mine, not yours! Please, please, God! Help me, in the name of God. Spare me, please! Spare me! We followed right behind, soldier. Does anybody come and get us? Do not know. They told me just to sound the alarm. I have 3 children and a pregnant woman. Someone has to come and get us. It is indifferent to them What happens to us? Of course not, but they they have no men to come. I must leave. I have to alert the others. Good luck, Mr. Ginsford. Equally. So, Abbie, then... Girls should not notice! Let's go! Get ready. Let's go to the fort see if they have arrived our packages. Get dressed! Let's go! Go on, girls, get ready! Let's go to the fort see if they have arrived our packages. You better bring the rest, son. Is there any sign of the knights? No, they arrive with the settlers, I suppose. "I suppose". Follow the Indians to that they are A: deceased, killed or imprisoned, or B: back to reservation and trapped, or C: cross the border of Mexico, which puts an end to its mission. Do you understand that, Lieutenant? Yes, sir. Do you have questions? No, sir. Good. Then go. Lieutenant! Yes, sir. Mr McIntosh accompanies him, as a counselor. Yes, sir. Concerning demand of tracks and the terrain, I advise you to follow, recommendations. Yes. As for military matters, It's you who has the command. Sure, mr. Thank you, So, Harry... You're anxious to leave, are not you? Yes, sir. I insisted a lot on the major, to give you this command. Thank you, Captain. You're welcome. Mount! Good luck, Lieutenant! To the left, turn! March. Step forward! Forward. Continence, run! Retreat, unthinking! It is not for me to give you orders, but it would be better if he came. Always would be two more rifles. Yes Yes. And what do you think would be left, when I came back? I have livestock and I have fields. I'm not leaving this to drunks who burn it all! Otherwise I get nothing, like when I got here. Look at this! One day this will be a beautiful farm. I will not let you, to any drunk! Billy! Sit down at your mother's feet! Come on, let's go! I can not stay here? Do as I say. Ride! Whoa! Go ride! Upa...! And take care of your mother! Good luck, Mr. Rukesyer. Thank you. Be careful, Willy! I... I'll get the doors, So you do not complain anymore. Let's go...! Hu! Come on! On my way! Good trip! Greetings to the boys at the fort. Here Jeff, Jeff! Come here! Come here, come on! Bravo, boy! You're my boy! It would not have been better to take it, the trail next to the reservation? There are many ways to do things sir. They found the track, sir! I found something! Prepare to disassemble! Disassemble. Disassemble. Are they. Advance continuously but not quickly. Since when? Morning. They make a big breakthrough. The speed of advancement will depend of how many people kill. What are the settlers, who are on your way? If they go south, they kill everything. whatever they find on the way. Otherwise, kill wherever you feel like it. We can show them that Are we on your trail? They know we're on our way. But it does not make sense to go fast. This is exactly what we should do, Mr. McIntosh: rush us. Lieutenant, a horse just walks So fast and so far, till it falls. An apache fires the fire underneath of the belly, so that it rises. If the horse dies, it eats a bit and steal another. That's the way it always is. I do not like people are unprotected. Yes. You'd better not even think about it. All right, Sergeant. Step forward! My God! Mother, Indians! Soldier! Do not leave me! Do not leave me! Thank you! Thank you! Come on, boy! Come on, boy! Jump! Mom! Not! Hey, Jeff! Hey, boy! If you come in, I'll kill you! Your drunks, if they come, I do of you anti-alcoholics in a moment Did you hear me? It's not nice to clean behind two Apaches. Why did they spare the kid? Spared what? Why did not they kill him? On a whim, my lieutenant. Apaches have many fads. At least they did not rape the woman. Because she was already dead. Ke-Ni-Tay thinks that Horowitz killed the woman. and tried to run away with the kid. When they hit your horse, committed suicide. Good man, this Horowitz. I have to send the kid back, with an escort. What are Ulzana's plans? It will continue. Two men enough for the kid. Two? If we find Ulzana We will need all men! Sergeant! Mr.! Send two men, back with the car. Is there anyone of concrete in mind? No, choose them yourself. Mr.! Roberts, Winfield, get ready! Take the car to the fort! Give the order to continue! Soldiers! Prepare, to ride! Mount! Ahead, step by step! Not, These do not come to my house! These drunks do not get me! You do not take away this farm! You do not! Oh me... Ruckeyser is not afraid of anyone! From anyone! Not! You can come at ease! Come on, come on! Are you listening? Come on, get in! Go... God! God! It's up to you to praise and the glory! It's up to you to praise and the glory! God... You protected me, be praised and be glorified! High! Have it disassembled! Prepare to disassemble! Dismount, now! Is he in there? Do not. McIntosh! Oh my God! The fire is off, for about an hour and a half. They must have watched him die. They can not be far. What's in his mouth? A dog's tail. Because? The Apaches have a sense of humor. Incomprehensible to you. They find certain things funny. I will never take see another apache in life. In 1891 I persecuted Nana, with Lieutenant Gilpoil. At the time, I was a corporal. Riding for three weeks and we did not see a single Apache. Maybe by now, in the mountains, To eat the dog Ruckeyser and to think: "It was a good start". We have a long way to go! Good evening, McIntosh! Good night. Good night. You put double lookouts in the field and watchmen around the sand. Awakening at first light and leaving half an hour later. Right sir! Ke-Ni-Tay, I want to ask you something. It's ok. Silence now! Let's get some sleep. Why do your people, does that? Why are they so cruel? Because? Because that's how they are. But why? Because yes. They always were. Are you like that too? Would you kill a man like that? Yes. Because? To get your strength. When a man dies, the one who kills him appropriates himself, of its strength. A man delivers, his strength when he dies. Just as the fire delivers the heat. A fire that burns a lot of time It's very hot. Do you think that you are being tortured? a man for many hours, get strength, because you see the poor man to suffer? What kind of force is this? Here in this country, a man must have strength. It's something you do not understand. But I want to understand. I want to understand. The Ulzana is already in the reserve, long time. It does not have much force anymore. All the smells on your nose are old reserve smells. All old smells. The scent of women, the smell of dogs, the smell of children. A man with smells old on the nose, is an old man. The Ulzana came, to smell new things: horses, running, the smell of fire, the smell of bullet for strength, soldiers with cars without force. Women do not force. Not pleasure. Why did not they kill the boy? A boy does not give strength. Just a man. Then Ulzana will kill many. Yes many. Do you hate the Apaches, Mr. McIntosh? Do not. I did. What can not make happy, lieutenant... but at least you're not alone. Most whites think so. And why not you? Hates the desert, because there is no water? It is enough for me to be very afraid of him. Company, stop! Have you ever eaten a dog? I do not even want to try You know, when you're young. Where have they gone? Ke-Ni-Tay? Where it is difficult to follow them. Where will they fight against us? He does not want to fight against you, Lieutenant. He wants to kill you. Do you know Ulzana? His sister is my wife's sister. Sisters? His wife is ugly. Hunm... My wife is not so ugly. Advance... Company, stop! Curse! What does he intend, Ke-Ni-Tay? Ulzana wants you to walk. He wants us to kill our horses. Do you know how the soldiers are? Apaches are better off. Company, step forward! It will be like this all the time, sergeant? Hunm, hunm... Company, stop! When were you here? At dawn or a little later. Horse excrement dry after some time. This one is already quite dry. Ke-Ni-Tay thinks it was, about five hours ago. Is that you? I do not discuss excrement, with an apache, my lieutenant. The expert is it. Well, we're not to approach us. Only if we continue until, that horses can no longer and then we walk. That's what Ulzana wanted! But I do not want to walk, where an Apache goes on horseback! What if we can not catch him? Think of the rules, Lieutenant. The first one who makes a mistake will have, than to bury some dead. Got it! When did you come from the East? From the East? Of Academy. About six months ago. They would be very proud, If they saw you now, Lieutenant! All right, Sergeant, go ahead! A step, move forward! High! What is up? High. We have a problem, Lieutenant. What problem? Ke-Ni-Tay thinks everyone the horses go without a knight. Minus two. The first and the last. You mean they're after us? Yes. There's plenty of time. Is he for sure? Yes, it does. This is what brands show, of the horseshoes. Probably an ambush. I do not think so, Lieutenant. He wants to take us, to the mountains... and then attack from behind. His horses will be fine fresher than ours. If we go after them, we will have to dismount. And if not, it will soon be before us. In any case, he's the last one to laugh. Apparently he's already caught up with us. As I said, my lieutenant: The first to make a mistake, will have to dig graves. His plan is smart. But maybe we are more. How will it be? We have to arrive, to his horses before. This is us. These are their horses. Somewhere along this line they come back, go back and get Ulzana. Ulzana is here. The question is: he went to the right, Or went to the left? The other question is: how long has the circle, what horses will do... to the right or to the left, on the way to Ulzana? Can you recognize the tracks at night? In non-rugged terrain, if you can, but nine horses in a straight line, This is possible, if there is moonlight. How should we dispose of the troops? I'm going with a rider around here and Ke-Ni-Tay with another over there. When one of us finds the track, the knight comes to get you. Thank you! You'd better leave now. Do you want specific riders? No, as long as you do not be very talkative. The watchmen are at their posts. Very good, Sergeant. I told them to be very vigilant? No need! First, sir? Right. Ruckeyser got it. Are you reading the Bible Mr.? Yes. A gift from my father, the last time I was at home. My father is a pastor. I heard you, mr. If I could ask him, about the Apaches! What, sir? Why do they do, these terrible things? I mean... They are also people, made in His image, like us. "Lieutenant, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" is the only Bible, which serves the Apaches. That's how we have to treat them. Christ taught us Something else, sergeant. Yes, it is a fact. But Christ never took a baby, of the spines of a cato, and waited two hours that he died, to bury him, hem Do not. But, I yes. But it will be! I do not... No one tells me, to turn the other to the Apaches, Mr. Oh... Now they're after us. Then tell the lieutenant, that we found the trail. He who comes quickly, to continue to pursue them. Hya, hya... Go... Go... Ho... Right, back! High... Good morning, Lieutenant, I am glad to see you. What has happened? I got to their horses. How many were they? A 9. Enemies, I mean. Two. There's one of them, dead. The other is injured. Been a while ago from the hill and then continued. Sergeant, look for the footprints! Hayle, Buckley, follow me! Prepare to disassemble! Disassemble! Go on foot. A good description for men without horses, my lieutenant! We should continue persecution. It will be difficult to find Ulzana. We should wait for Ke-Ni-Tay. They told me that they can read traces as well as an Apache. Then they told him wrong things, Lieutenant. Mr. McIntosh, I want to continue. You give the orders, I just say my opinion. He was here, sir. But now it's gone. You really hit him. Can you follow a trail, Sergeant? I think so, if he continues, to lose blood. All right, take a man and chase after him. We then pick it up, My lieutenant? Not worth the effort. He can no longer reach Ulzana, will die on the way. But he may not die. It was you who said that the Apaches, on the warpath both come, with 100 as with 1 warrior. That's true. If we have to wait for Ke-Ni-Tay we should seize the time. Sergeant! Yes, sir! Miller! Yes, sargent! All right, come with me! Cable! Get the lookouts! Yes, sir! Lookouts! At the posts! Now! Stab him! Stab him! Yes, that's the way it is! Cut him out! Cut him off carefully! Dirty Dog of an Apache! What is this? There's a soldier's gun, sir! He is the son of Ulzana. They treated Horowitz very badly. The Apaches are afraid when if this be done, with their dead. I want you to bury this kid, did you realize? Bury him! What has a lieutenant? Are you the son of Ulzana? I think so. You think so? Because they did not tell me that the son, Was Ulzana here too? Had he changed anything? At least I would have had the feeling of being the commander. You're right, Lieutenant. I should have told you. I was waiting for death sr. McIntosh, but... I do not accept mutilation and torture as readily as you. What it costs him to accept, my lieutenant, is the idea that whites, they behave like the Indians. This upsets your vision of the world, is not it? Come horsemen! Ke-Ni-Tay and the knight! Now we just need your hunters, my lieutenant... and we can go. Ke-Ni-Tay says that Ulzana goes first look for water, then the horses. It had already happened to me. We have one less horse, my lieutenant. Ke-Ni-Tay gives him his. The Apaches walk better, than the soldiers, remember? Cable, mind things, of Mr McIntosh. Yes, sir! Left, back. Ahead, step by step! Advance. I'll take your horse. Knights in sight, sir! Sergeant Burns. Company, stop! What do you have to report, Sergeant? The soldier Miller succumbed to his wounds... Mr. And the enemy? Is dead... Mr. All right, I want to, a full report. There is nothing more to report, sir. Unless you want to know, which Miller thought of death. Give the orders of departure, Corporal. Yes, sir! Ahead, step by step! We had a lead, Lieutenant, but we lose it. Impossible to follow her in these cliffs. I want to get him. High. The horses can not go any more. They need rest and food. Ulzana needs horses. These do not reach a dozen. You mean we won? My lieutenant I am to you, to say how it is. Ulzana can not lead the warriors on foot. Have to... Steal horses, I know. Sergeant, where you live, the nearest settler? They are close to 5 corns, to the Riordans, along the hills. They have good water. Horses too? One or two, perhaps, I do not know for sure. We can rely on this man, to follow the track? I trust him. Let's go to the settler. Meet you there. My God! Leave the corpse where it is! It has to be buried. The apache guide does that. Lieutenant, that does not make sense! Look at this, Mr. McIntosh! He was a white man! Like you, a white man! You do not make sense! Mr. McIntosh! Mr. McIntosh! Mr. McIntosh! Give me a blanket! That's it. And the first-aid box! Untie her, she's still alive. Ha, a, a... Carefully! How's she doing? In the same. The Apaches are like this too cruel, to their wives? It is not a very beautiful life. Do you live with an Indian woman? Yes. Because? What a stupid question! I understand that you feel sorry for them. Feather? That's why she lives with her. You should bury your hatred and start thinking, Lieutenant. Until now did not make great figure. Ke-Ni-Tay, I want to talk to you. What is Ulzana going to do? The Ulzana now think of your son. And just want to kill. To avenge the son. This will cost many lives. What does he plan? Ulzana took two horses from here. Need more. If you can not, your men return to the reserve. Apache is not a soldier. Apache does not sign role to fight. Only fight when you want. You mean that he is no longer on the warpath? Ulzana wants to have a lot of power and many horses. If not possible leave of being on the warpath. Where does he want to get this power and the horses? From you. He wants to kill you and take you away all horses. As? Attacking us? What are you going to do with Mrs. Riordan? We have to get her to the fort. How many men are with you? Six, with Sergeant Burns. Want to split your troops? I have no choice. Not? What do you think? Ms. Riordan, have to return to the fort. Usually the Apaches violate, women captured to death. Why did you spare Mrs. Riordan? Maybe they thought, she was dead. Ulzana wanted, that you found her. He knows you're sending it back and wants to attack your soldiers. In the fight against the Apaches there, they anticipate what they will do. Only those who know it have a chance. We force Ulzana to attack and set up an offensive. That is why we have strengthened our troops. Or we reduce them. We will only make them show themselves, if they think they will win. I understand. It is very dangerous for the escort and Ms. Riordan. And Mrs. Riordan. You can speak or act. But you should listen, Lieutenant, what Ke-Ni-Tay tells him. Ulzana's people are tired of roaming the mountains, where there are only wild fruits. You will soon start to miss the reserve and their wives. Mrs. Riordan! I want to wash. Mrs. Riordan! I have to clean up! I want to wash! Mrs. Riordan! Mrs. Riordan! I want to wash. Please, I want to wash. I want to wash. I have to clean up! Do not leave. Wait! Oh, do not leave. Ah... Oh, come on! Curse! Leave me! Leave me alone! Those damn Indians. Peter, I wanted to die. Ah... My God! He wanted so much to die. I assure you, Mrs Riordan, we will do everything Why do they do this? They do not treat better, the women themselves. If you need anything, call. Someone will hear it. Young... If they return... Promise me not to Will you let them take me? Do not worry. Promise me! Promise me! I promise. Thanks. The poor woman is almost mad. Imagine having to see the husband dies. I do not want to go back, to put it in danger. There is no other way? Not if you want Ulzana. Oh, yes, Mr. McIntosh. I want the. High! With this escort will safe, Ms. Riordan. And the way is good. I hope to see you in the fort, in happier circumstances. Sergeant! Give the order of departure! You have to look serious. Ulzana observes him, in order to the certainty that fell into the trap, before he fell into ours. I understand. Good luck! For you too You are fine? Yes... In front... Right, back! High! Company, stop! Disassemble! I thought I was going to leave, the Indians get us out of here? Because? If we go too far we can not return to help McIntosh. And if we go back too soon they they are warned and do not attack. It is a question of the right moment. The Apache is calling you, sir! Which is? Ulzana wants you to go up there. Mountain of fire. Your plan is clear. So we have to do it. Not! You can not go there. If you do you will not be able to return to help McIntosh. For this it is still too soon, Mr McIntosh. And they watch us. Or not? How many are watching us? One man sees as much as ten. Can not we find it and kill it? You not. Ke-Ni-Tay, can you? Yes... But it will, what will it do? Ke-Ni-Tay signed the paper. Ke-Ni-Tay is a soldier. Okay, look for him and kill him! Give me your binoculars. When you see, it makes light... like this... you have to join you, to McIntosh. It's ok. Corporal, orders to dismount! Yes, sir! Let's cross the Dog Canyon, will not we? Yes. Is that where you expect them to attack us? Can be. You do not fool me, McIntosh. That's the plan. And at the last moment it appears, Lieutenant DeBuin to save us? More or less. More or less. You have a lot of confidence in a man, who has no idea! How are they going to attack us? Maybe they will not. Keep the horses, which they covet, well hidden. In the latter case, that knock them down. Abate them? Yes, knock them down. The army will not like it. You'll still like it less, if the Apaches steal the horses. All right, I'll warn the men. But she does not notice anything! It's ok. Cars, forward! Keep your eyes open! How long do you think, What does he need? I do not know. Can we trust Apache? We have to do it, Corporal. There! On the rock! You see? Yes. Found it! Come on! In front! Come on! Move it! Let's go! Come on! High... Can we cross quickly? Lets wait a little bit. What? Ke-Ni-Tay needs of time to find the spy. Disassemble! Let the horses rest! Curse! Hold the horses! Do not let the horses escape! Do not let them get away! Come here. They are on both sides. We have to get out of here! No, come down! Let the horses go and use them as shield! Stand behind your horses! Do not scatter! Get down! Stay together! The car! Stop the car! To the cliffs! Under the rocks, damn it! Oh oh... Help me, sergeant! I'm seriously injured. Help me! Come on! Hold on! Come on! Oh, ah... McIntosh! You can cover me. Mrs. Riordan, mind him! It is not necessary, it is not serious. Someone to kill me! Please! Can someone kill me? In the name of the good Jesus! Does someone kill me? Where the hell is the lieutenant? What are we going to do? Straight ahead, galloping! Come on. Is everything okay with you? My goodness! What Day is Today? What? What a day? Wednesday. It does not look like Wednesday. Wednesday... Oh oh... Oh, oh... High... The car, sir! Somebody move! What? At the foot of the car. Have it disassembled! Disassemble! Mind Ms. Riordan! Jack, take care of the horses! I'll help you. Smithers, Johnson, help! We came as soon as possible. Ulzana ran away like this, who listened to his music. It was to warn you that we were coming. But... the trick was not to notice. Watch out! Feel it! All right, bring some blankets over here and raise a shelter! Get the car out! So many men... If only I... Leave yourself alone! It was his decision, have to live with it. Oh, my God, Lieutenant... We all make mistakes. But he did not say no to tobacco. I have some. Good boy! Corporal, have the Apaches buried. Bury? Yes, bury it! Yes, sir! Men to dig! I think making cigarettes... not exactly, one of his talents. I am not sorry. It does not hurt You will learn. It's Ke-Ni-Tay. The time has come We put it in the car. This will only cause me suffering. You can not stay here. It takes us two days to return, Until then he will be dead. I die anyway, Lieutenant. Not if we take him to a doctor. You're not taking me to a doctor. Not even, I'm going to get in the car. And your... Burial? I'm not really keen on the idea to be one of those small crosses in the fort. I leave you some men. Not at all! I do not want to pass, My time with gravediggers. Damn it, Lieutenant, let me stay here! This is not Christian. Okay, my lieutenant, it's not. Knight in sight! You're right. It's Ke-Ni-Tay. Ulzana, here's the apache! We're ready to leave, sir. Mr. McIntosh stays here at his own request. Yes, sir! What about Ulzana? Bury him! They will want to see the corpse, at least the head. My report will come. Yes, sir. I'll take care of that. Not! I do it. All right, Corporal. Mr. McIntosh! Mr. DeBuin. Guide! Mount! Ready to ride! Mount! Ready to go, cable? Yes, sir. Come on! Step forward!
