Our ambition was to make a film about the new world order and its values. And about what's happening to us. About the world we inherited from our fathers and the world we will leave to our children. This called for looking, thinking, listening and analyzing Only if you do this your conclusions will not be false. Mr. Putin, will there be a war? Do you mean a world war? THE WORLD ORDER There are common values in the world. OLIVER STONE Film director (USA) These are in every religion, color, form and field. The world is infinitely mysterious, infinitely deep. The struggle goes on! Those who refer to the current social system as perfect must be cynics. Sahra Wagenknecht Member of the Bundestag Today's world isn't fair. Making the world fair is the only political ambition. Dominique Strauss-Kahn Director of the IMF (2007-2011) To a degree, this will depend on the concrete decisions of specific individuals. Thomas Graham, assistant to the President of the USA (2004-2007) The situation is extremely dangerous. I'm urged to ask those who created this situation: Do you at least realize now what you've done? New York. The UN General Assembly. You are met by a less than friendly audience, and after the US President. Vladimir Solovyov Did you know already what Obama had said in his speech? Frankly, no, because I had just arrived. And you tell them in their face, "Do you at least realize now what you've done?" I didn't say this to him. Not him, but them. No. You know, I've talked with many leaders both in Europe and in the US, and for many years, When they launched these operations in Afghanistan or Iraq and later in Libya, I always took a firm stance that this should be done very carefully. You can't spread your schemes and your views of good and evil — in this case of good and democracy - mechanically to other countries and nations... which have a different culture, religions and traditions. But frankly, no one listens any more. Why? Probably because they think of themselves as great and infallible. But they don't assume any responsibility for their actions. The situation in Syria. It's a humanitarian catastrophe. Of the roughly 23 million people living in the country, nearly half are turned refugees or got killed. Julian Assange Journalist (Australia) So half the country has been annihilated. Julian Assange, on the WikiLeaks website. published thousands of pages of diplomatic correspondence that shed light on war crimes in Iraq and on the preparations for destabilizing Syria. Trapped at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for the past three years, Assange is hiding from the charges that are questioned around the world. A few years back, his name could have become a legend of journalism. Now he is political hostage of the modern world order. We demonstrate proofs in our network that the USA have tried to overthrow Assad at least since 2006. To do this, they not only increase actual discontent inside the country in regard to the democracy and human rights but also provoke Assad's government to react by stirring up discontent inside the country. These are actual quotes from confidential US government reports. And so is "promoting tensions between the Sunni and the Shia". The entire Muslim world was colonized as far back as 200 years before WWII. Pervez Musharraf President of Pakistan (2001-2008) Maybe all apart from Turkey. The whole Muslim world. When we got independence, we were a poor, illiterate, backward nation. Religion was the only support for the illiterate and backward masses. Pervez Musharraf used to be an ally of the United States. First of all, I've arrived to congratulate the President Bush with his victory in the elections. Friendship between the USA and Pakistan is vital to ensure the security and stability in the Middle East. General Musharraf seized power in a military coup and ruled Pakistan with an iron hand. His life is a carbon copy of the lives of many other Eastern leaders who pledged loyalty to Washington. As soon as their policies become too independent, Washington hangs them out to dry. After losing power in his country, Musharraf fled from legal prosecution to London and has returned to Karachi only recently. Islamists have made many attempts at his life. Nevertheless, he has developed a peaceful strategy for the Islamic world. The strategy concerns the Muslim world. We reject extremism and terrorism, and go for the way of social development. And we ask the world to help us, the Muslim world, one of the most backward and uneducated worlds, to help us with social and economic development. But we demand that the West, on the other hand, should resolve political issues concerning the Muslim world. In December 2011, we published a document that covered a meeting of the US, French and British Air Force, and the US private intelligence division, Stratfor. It is a private contractor of the American intelligence. They discussed the matters in Syria, who and how was acting there. They said secret agents were acting there already in order to promote the organization of murders. But they also needed public rebellions and bloodsheds to have a significant reason to intervene and attack the Syrian air defense forces. Russia has exercised its right to veto over Syria four times. And three times jointly with China over the political aspects of the Syrian crisis... We said, friends, look, the Security Council must not be involved in changing regimes. There are arms suppliers, companies that are close to Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, such as CIA, Air Force, etc. These tend to strengthen, to justify their budgets via intervention in Syria. In Syria, before the hostilities, HADZH BAYL, Refugee we lived okay and had everything we needed. Those who say otherwise are simply lying. Our wages were enough. Life was cheap. I mean normal ordinary life. When the terrorists came, it became as bad as it gets. The situation in Syria definitely stems Vyacheslav Nikonov Political scientist from serious violations of international law established by the United Nations Charter 70 years ago in San Francisco, based on the Yalta Conference principles. It was a meeting of allies, but the kind of allies that were more inclined to bare their teeth behind the scenes. It was no coincidence that Stalin actually slept at the Yusupov Palace in Yalta at the time which was situated exactly between the places where Churchill and Roosevelt were living. He did this in order to be able to spot any separate moves those two could have made, such as pay a visit to each other and perhaps contemplate something against Russia. Against the then Soviet Union. It was the trust-but-verify adage in action, always. In any case, what emerged after Yalta was not designed as unipolar. Fedor Lukyanov Political scientist The underlying idea of that world order was effectively dividing the world into two camps, two blocs, two systems, both engaged in a complicated web of relations with each other, but counter-balancing each other more than anything. So when did it start? At what point did the Yalta structure begin to crumble? After the demise of the Soviet Union, I think. You were witness to the fall of the Wall... you worked there... Not exactly. I had returned to the Soviet Union before that, I had left before the Wall fell. But it was not about the Wall The Yalta Conference documented the real balance of power at that time. In 1945, the victorious nations, they built a system that suited to the political alignment of forces at the time. A lot has changed since then. Nuclear weapons emerged as a major factor in global affairs. It has since spread to several other countries. New emerging giants such as India and China have entered the scene, while the Soviet Union left the political stage. So the bipolar system, it seems to have just collapsed. Not shook, but collapsed. For our partners, that could have been a great moment to think about, taking advantage of this situation and emerging as moral leaders in new global relations. But they continued to act and think in their old ways. The Cold War clichés seemed stuck in their heads. Was there a moral dimension to the agreements reached in Yalta? We were naive to believe that they were based on moral principles. While they were simply afraid of the Soviet power. No, I can't agree with that. I think that far from being based on any kind of moral values, the Yalta Conference and the ensuing agreements were primarily dictated by the actual balance of power and the experience of the previous decades. Among other things, the bitter experience of the so-called League of Nations, created in the aftermath of WWI with a view to regulating interstate relations, played a role. But it didn't take long before it was history. Why? Because it lacked an instrument that could have allowed it to prevent conflicts. A new concept was developed to establish the United Nations and the UN Security Council. First and foremost... There's Chapter 7 that envisages the use of force against states that breach international peace. The same chapter stipulates that this requires a unanimous decision by the UN Security Council. And its permanent members have veto right. What does this mean? It means that no one can take such harsh measures unless there's full consensus and agreement on the issue. This is the cornerstone of international law. WHAT FOR? 23.12.1999 FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS We, I'm referring to Yugoslavia, became the first victim of a newly established order. Aleksander Vucic Prime Minister of Serbia of which we knew nothing, even though someone was working hard to create it. In 1992, Emir Kusturica Filmmaker (Serbia) George H.W. Bush said that all the republics of former Yugoslavia would be able to establish diplomatic relations with the United States only after they seceded from Yugoslavia. Tomislav Nikolic President of Serbia Several months of a focused campaign was all it took for the people of this country to want it to fall apart. It was a country with its own flag, Olympic team, sea and mountains... The disintegration of Yugoslavia was the greatest injustice for me. The bombing of the country went on for 78 days. All major cities, defense and civil infrastructure, suffered from air strikes. The operation to destroy Yugoslavia was carried out by 14 NATO members, and included 1,200 aircraft, three aircraft carriers, six attack submarines, two cruiser ships, seven destroyers, thirteen frigates, four landing carriers, and 60000 NATO troops. Today, when a big country attacks a small one, it always says that it does so in the name of justice, morality, higher goals and in the interest of democracy, with the sole purpose of helping other people to have a better life. Lord David Owen Minister of Foreign Affairs (UK, 1977-1999) We had no right to start the war. The UN Security Council meeting on the Balkans without the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia can lead nowhere, since one of the key parties with a real impact on regional developments is barred from taking part in the discussion. Thank you. (Lavrov walking out of the UN Security Council in 2000) We exited from this situation devastated, the whole world left from it devastated. We, the Serbs, are familiar with the refugee problem. We know how hard they have it. My father... was born in Serbia. He is from a family of refugees, a refugee himself. The refugees are willing and hopeful. All they want is to forget the bloody past... Refugee camp for Serbs As for hope... I hope that my dear wife, my son and I will one fine day drink morning coffee looking at the most beautiful color in the world, the color of the walls of our own home. Milan Pevalica Refugee The war in Yugoslavia showed that our civilization has been exhausted across the board. It is no longer Christian, Muslim or even atheist. It no longer has any underlying principles or ideals. Our country is a great country, having many great things. I love it, and this is my homeland. I love it the way I love my mother, but also I hate my mother. We had many disputes in the past. She's already gone, but my she'll always stay with me. As will my country. I was young, I served my country, I was twice wounded. I fought, I believed in what we did. And many years past until I learned: the brutality of war is awful. It changed the American society for worse. Carelessness became the consequence of what happened during that war. Vietnam. We in Afghanistan... It turns out it didn't always work out. Let's not mix us up with Vietnam... us with Afghanistan and with Vietnam. After all, we intervened in Afghanistan at the demand of the Afghan incumbent government and president. There's a huge difference. Whether we had to get entangled as we did in Afghanistan is a different question, one we have yet to answer. This is also quite an ambiguous matter, you know. It's hard to say whether it was the right thing to do or not. It's clear that there were a lot of mistakes. But the decision itself, whether it was the right thing to do or not, requires careful consideration... A lot of mistakes compared to what? Compared to the Vietnam campaign by the US, we made few mistakes. I think so. But the fact that the Afghan campaign, if we can call it that, was a mistake for the Soviet Union, is obvious. Despite their experience in Vietnam, America has not stopped interfering in all international affairs, whereas Russia has been afraid of this for years, even though it has a much more positive experience. It's not that we are afraid. We behave more discretely, and when we do something, we try to protect ourselves from potentially negative consequences as much as possible. And yet... But they don't think about this, they are great, sitting across the ocean. With the dollar as the global currency and the world's largest economy... and when they launch an operation, and it fails they think: what, we weren't successful? Time to move on to the next one. Between the years 1981 and 2001 it looked like the world had resurged Fedor Lukyanov Political scientist and was growing stronger under US management. The 9/11 terrorist attacks shook America to the core. Being a major power, America needed to absorb and respond to this shock. I can hear you! I can hear you! The entire world can hear you! And those who have attacked these buildings will hear you all soon! The start for me was the tension which was increasing in Iraq, Dominique de Villepin France's Prime Minister (2005-2007) and the worsening of relationships between USA and the regime of Sadam al-Hussein. The military intervention by USA was quite possible. In 2002-2003 we worked hand in hand with Russia and Germany in order to prevent US military intervention in Iraq. Russia, France, Germany and believe me the overwhelming majority of the international community believe that the Iraq problem can and should be settled diplomatically. My fellow citizens, at the present moment, American coalition forces are starting the military operation aimed at disarmament of Iraq for liberation of people and protection of the world from the deadly danger. On the night of March 19/20, 2003 AD, or 1424 Hijri, in the Islamic calendar, I was shocked when we returned to Iraq. US failed to learn the lesson of the war in Vietnam, which says: We mustn't invade other countries. At a certain moment we lost our belief in the international law. Britons and Americans again invaded Iraq, and again without UN resolution. The execution of Saddam Hussein. No one knows what the executioners and their victim were talking about in the last minutes. The footage has no audio. Preparations for the execution were filmed in cynical detail. Clearly, Saddam Hussein remained calm, even when his neck was wrapped in a black headscarf, although he, of course, was aware of what would happen in a minute. He was aware of it primarily because he himself was a bloody and brutal dictator. However, the judges are not much different from the accused. Why was there no investigation into the murder of Saddam Hussein? This Arab leader was hanged, and we are sitting on the sidelines doing nothing. Why? Summit of the League of Arab Nations. 26 March 2011 One of you will be next. Muammar Gaddafi Hillary Clinton Secretary of State (USA, 2009-2013) We came, we saw, he died. Was the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya a tyranny? It's hard to say. Relatively, yes. Very relatively. Did it have ideas, elements of democracy? Of course it did. Of course it did. Was it better when Gaddafi was in charge than it is now? Definitely better. Incomparably better. Therefore, if you call a spade a spade, ask yourself questions and then give honest answers you'll come to the realization that it's like a runaway car engine, that something went wrong In 1991 and 1993, they sort out Iraq without the permission of the UN Security Council find their own methods, and get away with it. It's like I said - impunity. It's one of the reasons for extremely sloppy behavior in the international arena. Because there's no one to answer to. The largest, the most powerful country, both economically and militarily. Therefore, there is a temptation to skirt things. Or to declare the existing structure of international relations obsolete. The modern architecture of international relations is based on the United Nations Charter. This is the foundation of modern public international law. But it's being complied with only when there are at least two forces. When we came back as a force it became clear that we can again talk about the role of the Security Council and the United Nations. Well, not always. I wouldn't put too much focus on this Of course, disputes often arise where the interests of the states collide, or the states are played one against the other, or for objective reasons. Such conflicts may result in violations of the UN Charter. However, occasionally they coincide. Regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we have full consensus with the Europeans, the Americans, and the Chinese, our Chinese friends. Nobody wants more countries with nuclear weapons. We know that this may be dangerous to international peace and security. However, the United States is going to supply to Germany... What? their planes equipped with... US tactical nuclear weapons have always been there after World War II, after America became a nuclear power. Now, they are just replacing them with upgraded equipment. There's nothing new about that. However, it certainly is dangerous, because our tactical nuclear weapons are not strategic with regard to the United States. They cannot reach their territory, whereas US tactical nuclear weapons in Europe can reach our territory. In that sense, they are of strategic nature for us. And they are of greater threat to us than our tactical nuclear weapons are for them. I don't know Putin, but I'm sure that his policy is the bravest of all Russian policies. Putin really closed the military base in Cuba. He closed the military base in North Korea. He settled two, three or four problems which caused tensions in relationships between Russia and USA. It was him who took the initiative. The United States is an empire of military bases. The country has more than 1,400 bases scattered around the world. in more than 120 countries. Russia has only 12, or less than 1 percent of that number. So today there is no balance. For example, NATO's eastward expansion, and the fact that German servicemen are going there and the United States is conducting military exercises almost near the Russian border... these are very dangerous things that have become possible only at the request of Eastern European countries. By repeating that they feel threatened the Baltic countries have essentially legitimized this process. That said, not a single sensible person in the world would believe that Russia is going to attack the Baltic countries. I saw the growth of the national security of the American state on a global scale. I realized that the state is eager to control the economy of the world, in order to control the flow of ideas, as well as money and goods. We start wars, we like the idea of war. There is no more important task in the world than making peace. We lack it. We need to go back and recall that we are interconnected by the UN statutes, all of us. The 1947 decision to partition Palestine into two states was one of the most important decisions with far-reaching consequences ever made by this organization. Vitaliy Churkin UN's Russian representative Hardly anyone suspected that this seemingly necessary decision would become a time bomb. Nobody can make me surrender. It's not pleasant for me to repeat these words. I am here to fight and to win. Yasser Arafat. Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (1969-2004) We had a hard peace. Because Palestinians were divided. Shimon Peres President of Israel (2007-2014) They had two groups: one continued terror activities, the second refused and wanted negotiations. I came here with an olive branch in one hand and a weapon of revolution in the other. don't let the olive branch fall from my hand... Don't let the olive branch fall from my hand! Don't let the olive branch fall from my hand! From the early days I thought if we are ready to forgive ourselves, why can't we forgive others? The peace is a dialog, it is an unfinished peace, unfinished. What is missing? Why can't anyone find a recipe for establishing the world order? As I mentioned before. it's about the vestiges of the Cold War and the past - they are in our way and prevent us from making strides. After all, Europe expanded at the expense of Eastern European countries, which have always been very suspicious of the Soviet Union, at least over the past several decades of its existence. and transferred this feeling to modern Russia. Some of the Western European leaders told me during our debates on same issues that we did this and that to them. I said we never did that, the Soviet Union did. They still have these stereotypes. One state... Yes, they believe that we are the Soviet Union, which is not true. They either cannot or do not want to understand it. Because it is more convenient for them to keep it that way. In many Eastern European countries, anti-Russian propaganda and politics have become a factor in domestic political life. It is often used to come to power and stay in power. So they inflate these sentiments, which is harmful and counterproductive. It's interesting how following the collapse of the Soviet Union, all those who could not defend themselves were forced to break up into smaller pieces, as if someone was trying to reduce them to dust. It's convenient. This policy — divide and conquer — dates back to the Roman Empire. The idea is to break nations into smaller pieces so as to make them more controllable. As it turned out, you can always find — especially in the countries with economic and social issues — people who are willing to support separatism and permanent division in respective territories. Ukraine is Europe! Ukraine is Europe! I don't believe that accepting weak countries in the European Union is the right thing to do, because becoming part of the eurozone will not improve their situation in any way. Ukraine is unlikely to benefit from joining the European Union, although I don't think anyone is seriously considering this. Previous experience indicates that strong polarization usually follows poorer countries after they join the eurozone. There are people who got rich when their countries joined the EU. They can be found anywhere: in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria, or Romania. However, these countries paid the price — their poor have become significantly more impoverished. In many countries, the manufacturing industry was destroyed, because it wasn't competitive. In addition, many countries lost significant portions of their population. People emigrate en masse from Lithuania, Estonia and other countries. I'm not really sure whether there's a model of the future for those countries. In Ukraine there's no social organization system that would take into account the interests of the majority. I believe the interests of specific oligarchs are at play there. who see a chance to profit from exporting agricultural products and the like to the European Union. Color revolutions have taken place in many countries, and their key features look the same in all instances. Of course, much of what we saw in Ukraine two years ago is very similar to what we had seen in the Middle East and North Africa. Demonstrations, the toppling of a dictator and ultimately, complete freedom. We've been wrong to insist on our form of democracy. Everything is much more complicated, as we can now see. One may think that these are the processes that come from below, but this is all about high-tech provocations seeking to drive the masses to violent changes of regime. That is, if you call a spade a spade, it is precisely a violent change of regime. It's about imposing a certain system under the guise of democracy. There's a famous maxim: Democracies don't fight each other. If so, then the more democracy, the less the threat of an attack. FYODOR LUKHANOV. POLITICAL SCIENTIST It makes sense. If a democracy can't take root some place for whatever reason, they might need help. It has to be promoted. That's how Iraq, and later the idea of a large campaign to democratize the Middle East came about. For democracy as a concept, this is probably the worst thing that could happen. Making democracy a tool defeats its purpose. On August 14, 2013, 100 churches were attacked, ransacked and burned. This hurt the Christians of Egypt badly. A civil war nearly broke out. FEODOR II Patriarch of the Coptic Church Then I took advantage of my authority and said that even if they burn all the churches, We will come to our Muslim brethren and pray in their mosques. And if they burn all the mosques, we will pray together in the streets. People's faces show pain and sorrow. They are the relatives of Egyptian Coptic Christians kidnapped in Libya, who are believed to be dead. Heinous settings. Each frame has been verified and represents a metaphor. Wild waves. Clearly, they've been waiting for a little storm to break out and the sky to become overcast. The Mediterranean Sea coast as a message to Europe: "We'll come to you soon. We are close.” The place where the brutal massacre took place remains unknown. But the Coptic Christians were captured in a Libyan town populated by Sikhs. The smoke of incense goes up in a village church. The parishioners are praying for the dead. It's important to prevent terrorists from seizing power in entire states, SERGEY LAVROV Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia) to refrain from playing along with terrorists. It's imperative to think about the future of the countries of the region, preserving their secular nature. And saving the Middle East as the cradle of the world's great religions. It's important to promote political reforms in the region. However, they should be promoted in a way that's different from what happened during the Arab Spring when the government was toppled and things left to take care of themselves, as if democracy can take root itself. It is imperative to help the countries of the region torn by outside intervention, whose statehood was undermined, along with their ability to fight terrorism. Things are varied when it comes to fighting terrorism. For example, Saudi Arabia is not a terrorist organization, but it's a country with, first, a military and Islamist system, and, second, Saudi Arabia, though not the royal family, provides financial support to terrorist groups. Despite this, the country is an ally of the United States and Europe. That said, unfortunately, the fight against terrorism is not a common cause. Whose team are we on? In the Middle East? We're fighting with Iraqis, to defeat ISIS. Along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran. With Iraqis and Saudis. It is not quite so! Who are we bombing? We haven't left the Midle East. We're still there. We're stuck, creating one mistake after another. Like a big bear, with one paw in a pot with honey, stretching out the other paw towards it, raising it up and trying to free himself. Of course, any country, any reasonable leaders will be wary of a situation when this controlled chaos grows into an absolutely uncontrollable thermonuclear process. This is in fact what happened in the end. When they started talking about the Greater Middle East that was perhaps at the end of the past century, experts started using this terminology. Leaders began to use this terminology. For a while, it looked like academism, because there was not a whiff of an applied meaning. Perhaps, only now, retrospectively, can it be assumed with greater degree of confidence that this chain of color revolutions, which was initially supposed to be limited to controlled chaos, took place in the region that was referred to as the Greater Middle East. Iraq, Syria, Libya. A great number of people started living in countries that had ceased being countries. Those had been stable states. By Arab standards, by African standards, they were very stable, even prosperous states. They aren't any more. A whole number of countries are being lumped into one category, under one name. Recently, official representatives also started using a definition such as Greater Central Asia. This is also something to think about. Perhaps it is a boon for political commentators to figure out what it means. Do we have a formula to stop the export of revolutions? No. We should have only one formula - that is, strengthening the foundations of modern international law that I mentioned earlier. There cannot be any double or triple interpretation. No freewheeling interpretation of what sovereignty is and whether it should be respected. New things are being brought up. Say, with regard to Syria or some other states. After all, it is very easy to declare a particular government to a particular country illegitimate. What is the criterion of this legitimacy? Who defines it? Who decides? If we act as we go along and think in such terms, in voluntarist terms, not in a comprehensible, clear and transparent language that is understood in the same way by everybody, then chaos will ensue. Chaos is already there, and this applies to what's going on with the new great resettlement of peoples. After all, it shatters the entire legal picture of the world. - How to get a handle on it? - Not only the legal picture, This can also shatter the ethnic and religious picture of the world. Europe may lose its identity. After all... Generally, it is essential to help your neighbors who have found themselves in a difficult situation. It is also obvious that assistance should be provided to refugees. In this regard... The humanistic motives and emotional response arise in this connection deserve all-around support. The most important thing, however, lies elsewhere. I also said this at the UN General Assembly. The most important thing is not to rock legitimate, legal governments. Not to destroy their statehood even if it seems imperfect. However, if somebody sees it this way, how can it be done without violating international law? Help the forces in a country, by legitimate means, the forces that uphold your values, help them financially, politically or informationally, but do not act like a bull in a china shop, don't go over the top. Don't rock these countries! Don't break their statehood, as I said. Help them if you think these people deserve a better lot than the system of government they have: help the people in that country who are ready to fight from within for the ideals that you share. Do they hear you when you say it? They listen. I don't know whether they hear me. If the situation is what it is, then they do not really hear. A well-known resolution was adopted on Libya. I don't remember its [serial] number. What did it say? A no-fly zone. And what happened in reality? They started pounding the territory to bring about a change of government. They overthrew the government, killed poor Qaddafi, killed him brutally. So what? Did democracy come? A US ambassador was killed several months later. He was killed brutally... So what did they achieve? Why did they do it? It's only now that the UN has announced the formation of a unity government. How long will it be around? It's uncertain, to say the least. So, what is going on is just the divvying up of property. Divvying up natural resources. Yet could it have been done differently? What for? That would have required more time, more effort and more attention to the people. But sooner or later, transformation would have come about without such disastrous consequences. And without these hundreds of thousands of refugees. Disregard for stability in Libya will lead to a global collapse as a result of instability in the Mediterranean. If we lose control of Libya, millions of Africans will come flooding into Italy and France illegally. Europe will turn black in no time. We are preventing migration, also holding back Al Qaeda. If stability in Libya is shattered, this will be bad news for Europe and Mediterranean countries. Everyone will be in jeopardy. Over 10,000 migrants have drowned in the sea between Italy and Libya in the past week alone. The UK, Belgium and Germany have sent ships to the Mediterranean. However, British Prime Minister David Cameron said his offer of help does not involve taking in refugees. London has proposed handing down five-year prison terms for aiding illegals. Prime Minister Cameron said the UK should be protected (quote) from "a swarm of people." Did the prime minister realize that he was talking about the same people who, four years earlier, in Libya, he'd congratulated on victory and thanked for overthrowing the Qaddafi regime after the NATO bombing? Cameron did not say. Your city has inspired for the whole world, because you have overthrown a dictator and chosen freedom. They shot at us today. I saw it with my own eyes. Macedonian officers shot at us. The refugees have been here for a few months now... They don't have enough to eat. They don't get enough sleep, and they have no warm clothes. Winter is coming, and it's getting colder. It's cold here in the winter. If we let them stay homeless - under a bridge or on the street - they will never make it back to normal life. I don't think migrants will be a problem for the French. How are we going to address their employment issues, if we are already dealing with ours? KARIM Volunteer (Paris) And this is just the first wave of migrants. Many of them are still on their way here. We want to go further. We associate our future with Europe. The inequalities of development were not as salient in the past. DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN President of the IMF (2007-2011) The growth, the communications such as the Internet and television, make it possible for the entire world, almost the entire world, to be more aware of what's going on around the globe and to see and experience these inequalities. At some point, they become unbearable. The desire to leave for more prosperous places where they hope, perhaps in vain, to find work and send money home. This desire was there in the past, but there were fewer opportunities to act upon it then. Today, this desire has become stronger, and it becomes somewhat more realistic. Because travel is now more affordable. Migration to affluent destinations on the planet is a phenomenon That's unlikely to subside. On the contrary, it is gaining momentum. "Merkel, resign!" the mob chanted, protesting against migrants. Hundreds of people took to the streets in Leipzig. They shake their fists and shout: "Go away!" And threaten to burn refugees homes. Local nationalists walk along the streets of the German city of Riesa. The far-right has taken up the slogan "There is no place for refugees in Germany!" WOLFGANG SCHÜSSEL Austrian chancellor (2000-2006) Today 24% of Austrian population are those who weren't born in Austria. If we talk about schools, for example, in my native city of Vienna, German language is not native for up to 50% of pupils. I think this is the way society is changing. Look at what is going on in Europe. On the one hand, as we said, there is a flow of migrants. On the other, there is a rise in nationalist sentiments. People are losing their bearings. Don't write off Europe... Europe, united Europe - over 300 million people. A major economy: the euro is stable, winning... this is very good. It is winning positions as a world reserve currency. This is good because when there is only one reserve currency - the dollar - this narrows room to maneuver for the entire global economy. But... But... Today's Europe is what it is. With all of its internal contradictions and all the positive trends in its development. Europe is facing a system-wide crisis of the integration project as it was conceived in the 20th century. It's not that this model proved to be bad. Just the contrary. It was a wonderful, brilliant model of European integration, but it has exhausted itself... European integration has never been a democratic project. It has always been an elitist project. We are witnessing the obvious separation of European elites — the European establishment - from the public. The pubic is no longer able to understand what their government is in fact doing. The European Union pretends to be a single country. If it is a single country, it must have open borders, a single currency, single armed forces, single foreign policy and so on. It is a sham. YVAN BLOT Eurodeputee (1989-1999) Europe has been under the American influence since the end of World War II. However, back in 1945, General de Gaulle turned down the US proposal to have an American in the position of a French governor for two or three years. De Gaulle then said: "No, no way". In addition, he believed that the dollar enjoyed an overly privileged position, and suggested making gold a "neutral" currency. De Gaulle said it would be that way from then on. Later, he decided to withdraw from NATO's military organization... In 1969, de Gaulle left office. And I think that the Americans breathed a sigh of relief: at long last, this obnoxious man is out of their way. There were several presidents in France after de Gaulle, but they were all afraid of spoiling relations with the United States. Except, perhaps, Jacques Chirac. Germany is formally an independent country. I believe Germany has enough power and sovereignty to object if it disagrees with the United States. It just chooses not to. Or does so extremely rarely... For example, Germany allows the US drones to wage war from its territory, which is clearly at odds with its constitution. "Where were you, Ms. Merkel when Libya was bombed, Or when the Syrian opposition was sponsored? This is a way for the US to expand its influence, which is what it is effectively doing. Have you noticed that, Ms. Merkel? This is what Zbigniew Brzezinski referred to but you, as his vassal, agree with him on everything." Certain American think tanks operate through German media outlets... Every German politician is aware, and the higher their rank the better they are aware of the fact that as soon as they say what's on their minds, the media wall immediately fight back with the opposite opinion. Many find this reason enough to stay away from such conflicts. Most of the UN events take place in New York with the communications services provided by AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph Company) so that the outgoing Internet traffic, e-mail, fax, or Skype have to go through AT&T cables. Incidentally, it is the largest US telecommunications company with ties to the US government and a secret agreement with the National Security Agency to intercept each outgoing e-mail from the United Nations. Such pressure is not uncommon in the international political arena. Especially in the sphere of economic policy... Of course, such pressure is never exerted publicly. Preference is given to telephone conversations. But it's a fact. By way of example, I'll cite a real epidemic of fines on the part of the United States with regard to European companies, among others. Far-fetched excuses are being used. Those who dare violate unilateral US sanctions are punished severely. Say, last year alone, A French bank was slapped with an almost $93 billion fine — $8.9 billion, I believe. Toyota had to pay $1.2 billion, Commerzbank - a German bank - signed an agreement to pay $1.7 billion to the US budget. And so on and so forth. Is this the way to treat your allies? No, this is the way to treat your vassals who have dared to act as they see fit. They are punished for misconduct. The United States has appropriated the right to interpret law and to embody international law. The same goes far national law - not only US legislation, but also the national laws of any other country. US Congress was the greatest difficulty that I was faced with as the IMF Managing Director, because it doesn't think much of multilateral associations. Of course, the United States plays a major role and has a lot of clout. Which is OK, but it doesn't decide on things alone. It may so happen that there will be decisions that America does not like Dominique Strauss Kahn, a financier. He was head of the International Monetary Fund. He stood out for his independent judgment. Questioning both the need and the feasibility of dollar domination. He decided to run for the French presidency and was way ahead of other candidates until he ended up in a pretrial cell, on rape charges, together with a bunch of prostitutes and homeless people in New York. The charges eventually collapsed but Kahn's political career was obliterated. I am not posing as a hero. But condemning the feelings that we may have with regard to the system in which we live, or its inequalities, may mean questioning the foundations of this economy. The USA right now is participating in the project which may be not be so massive as the creation of UN, but which has similar ambitions. It is more important than the creation of the European Union. It is the three agreements, known as "The Three Big T's" covering 1.6 billion people and two-thirds of the world's GDP. The US is building a new trade mega-bloc — the Trans Pacific Partnership. It has invited half of the APEC member states but not China or Russia. The major US corporations have sought this for many years. American corporations are hiding behind national security. In other words, the danger is in China. They say China is going to integrate Eurasia... to create a new Silk Road. And that's why USA must integrate everyone possible. And to create a legal and trade super European Union. A union bigger than the European one. As soon as it is done, American corporations would be able to integrate into all these countries easier. A phone call from the State Department proves to be more important than any decision... In other words, the world is run by a corporation. The world is run by economic development laws. Yes, of course, diversified international corporations that know no boundaries. They function to enhance the quality and volume of production. raise labor productivity and achieve better results and secure bigger profits. They do not need borders. However, this is why the first GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) was created, and then the World Trade Organization, which essentially blurred the borders, so to speak. However, today, different realities have evolved: new players have emerged; they are no longer afraid; they've stopped saying "I'm so cared, so scared, so scared" as we like to joke, and they started talking forcefully about the need to observe their rights. What's more, their legitimate rights, within the framework of the WTO. To which almost everyone was admitted. But when talks once again reached an impasse and have since been unable to make any progress for a number of years now, because developing countries started claiming their place under the sun, which they regard as legitimate within the framework of these WTO rules and procedures... well, then apparently the idea came about: Why should we bicker with them here; we'll come to terms among ourselves on new rules that will apply only to us, and since we are the world's leading economies, sooner or later, They will have to work within the bounds of these new rules. that we will have made, but as part of other organizations. The world is moving forward. SHIMON PERES President of Israel (2007-2014) Let's remember the world 70 or 50 years ago. For example, take China. This was a poor, disintegrated country. They were saved not due to the Russian ruble or American dollar. They were rescued by two revolutions: one under the leadership of Mao Zedong, which forced people to work, uniting them, and the other under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping who said: "Good, you've done it! Now, let's open to the world and look what's to happen.” The same was with India. Again revolutions. Gandhi said: "I can't rescue you from poverty but I can save you from spiritual poverty. I can only help you spiritually. The 2nd revolution was under the leadership of Nehru. He said: "If you care about the soul, it doesn't mean you mustn't care about breakfast.” Compare this position with what was 40 or 50 years ago. Significant changes! We must see a change of the strategy in the world. The policy was focused on Europe earlier and was Eurocentric, that is, Europe and NATO were against the Warsaw Pact and so on. Now, the focus is here, on the Central Asia, Southern Asia, countries of Persian Gulf and Iran. The geocentric focus is now in this region. No single system, no single model of the world order has ever triumphed. Unity is in diversity. This is the key to stable global development. No attempts to put the world on one pillar have ever done any good. Paris 13 November 2015 That night, young people were sitting at sidewalk cafes MAREK HALTER French writer enjoying a drink and flirting with girls. And now they are dead. Everyone in France felt that they could have been in their place that night. Any French person could die. You didn't have to do anything wrong to get a death sentence. That's why it shocked everybody. Solidarity was strong. Solidarity and fear. How can eight terrorists make 67 million people tremble with fear? You know, I'd like to tell you one thing. Fifty years ago the streets of Leningrad taught me a lesson: If a fight is inevitable, you have to hit first. Mr Putin, these are turning points indeed. In fact, there are hordes on our borders. The Islamic State that has now recruited part of the Taliban It's not the first time. Not the first time but we have always overcome these turning points in history by relying primarily on the strong spirit of our country. We were convinced we are fighting for the right cause. Does the criterion of justice still exist in the world? How important is it? How important is morality? The last time Alexander I tried to unite Europe around Christian values he failed, regrettably. You know, I think that nobody should ever impose on anyone any values that he considers right. We have our own values and our own ideas about justice... I won't try to define them because it's unrewarding and the analysts always find something to reproach me for. But I think we generally understand what I'm talking about. I'm mainly referring to our traditional values, our history, culture and traditions... and everything associated with them. However, it's wrong to try and impose them on anyone. At one time the Soviet Union tried to impose Communist values on others and hold them by force... But I think, I'm sure many people would agree with me... even these Communist values didn't really matter. It all came down to the Soviet Union's geopolitical interests. That is, Russia that was called the Soviet Union at that time. This was the whole point. But it was wrapped in ideology. But there were values in the beginning. It seemed that Soviet Russia proposed a new world order — a fair one. Exactly... You put it right: Soviet Russia. This happened immediately after 1917. Absolutely. After World War I. It was very fashionable among democratic intellectuals in the world in general — in the States, Europe and elsewhere — Soviet Russia was a trendy state and its formula of new values was vary appealing. And... recalling my previous occupation, I remember very well some statements. I remember the people who analyzed the performance, say, of Soviet intelligence. Way back in the INO times. Yes, way back in the Foreign Department times. And this galaxy of outstanding Soviet intelligence officers and the famous Cambridge Five, and Sorge and others. One analyst said these people were serving selflessly, working for their ideological homeland. Later it all began to disappear anyway... began to lose its appeal and perspective. It doesn't work now. Russia is talking about traditional values under conditions of the crisis. A crisis of traditional values. Yes. But I assure you, there are lots of countries and people in the world that are fully on our side and share our viewpoint. And even if we are criticized, say, by the leaders of some countries, this doesn't mean that the citizens of these countries support their leaders and criticize us. Quite the opposite. Let me assure you that the majority of leaders... The majority of citizens of the countries whose leaders criticize us - the majority support us at heart. That's it. I'm fairly sure. It's a complicated process that involves rethinking what it means to be human and what images of society are correct and fair. Many people still live in poverty. BAN KI-MOON Secretary-General of the UN Many die of diseases which can be cured. Many live under oppression. It is a tremendous amount of inequality in the whole world, as well in certain countries between the rich and the poor. Because of the economic inequality, our knowledge about prosperity will get drowned in the ocean of poverty. In this world, there is a triangle: war - capital - profit. A fair society is reserved for the monied people. They are in a position to buy justice, women, houses, jets, and surround themselves with the people who say what they want to hear. And they feel that this is what fair society is all about. Freedom and justice means to me... obviously that is something I feel very acutely at a personal level. Having been detained without charges for around... more than 5 years, I have seen other people who go through the similar procedure. Chelsea Manning, allegedly my source, allegedly an intelligence analyst.... that is, really an analyst of US intelligence... was sentenced to 35 years of imprisonment in a military prison. He was in Iraq, he saw what was going on there, and was against it. And he was accused of that. But let's compare his penalty with others'. We unmasked a series of mass murders in Iraq, including the case when American soldiers raped a 14-year girl, killed her, killed all her family and burnt down their house. Some of those soldiers were found guilty by the American army. So even US Army has no doubts that they have committed a crime. What was the sentence? The sentence was around 10 years. And one of them was released already after 5 years. Now compare it with 35 years for alleged disclosure of secrets. The German philosopher Kant once said that we recognize something as a moral value only if it can be applied to all without exception. If a value is not universal, it is not moral. Many things that used to be the order of the day have vanished. The attitudes changed and the morals followed. The moral crisis has spread across the entire world, not just through the Christian one. FEODOR II. Patriarch of the Coptic Church Five components are needed to bring up a good person: a family, a home, a school, a church for the Christians, and friends. And all of the love that children should be getting from their parents. The horror of a disaster. A question arises... There are pundits and statesmen who are well aware of things... They can agree on things in order to avoid such disasters. Do we have to go through a war? Or not? It depends on the quality of our leaders and elites. How did it happen that from a stage in your dealings with Obama where there were comradely and trustful relations... now it seems the country as a whole is holding its breath waiting for the outcome of bilateral talks, not knowing what lies ahead - war or peace. This is why the world has again ended up on the verge of such colossal instability, where everything has come together at one point — the ambitions of a country called the United States, the unprecedented growth of an apocalyptic sect - i.e., the Islamic State, and the disintegration of the concept of morality. Including Christian morality. All buttresses on which the modern world used to stand suddenly collapsed and, on top of that, relations among leaders have soured. How can stability be achieved in this world? Today, we're seeing what we're seeing. However, I'd like to make another point. The fact is that our political nouveaux riches have lost their sense of realty, I think. They failed to grasp that irreversible processes have already begun within their own world. And even if they stand at attention and salute you today, this does not mean that this will carry on forever. Because — I don't know — there're some countries and nations that will never tolerate being in a secondary role. The role of an occupied country or the role of somebody's vassal. Sooner or later, this will come to pass And I think pretty soon, too. However, no country should be humiliated while another tries to prolong its leadership for as long as possible. Meanwhile, many elements of the foreign policy path pursued by our friends across the ocean in fact involve the use of force to assert their positions. This is certainly bad. But on the other hand, I don't think that we're on the verge of some apocalypse, because people are intelligent. People are intelligent everywhere - in Europe, across the ocean and in Asia. So the moment they feel that something has gone wrong... I believe they should be able to figure things out for themselves and... They figure things out and accuse you... Regarding those who are critical of me, to put it mildly... This applies not only to leaders of foreign countries... distant countries. This sometimes happens also... sometimes we hear from those nearby... we hear... at any rate, I hear... unjust criticism of myself, to put it mildly... Outright rudeness. Also from certain leaders of nearby countries But this is simply a manifestation of political culture of the lack thereof. In other words, this does not bother you on an emotional level. It does not. You picked this up while growing up in Leningrad. You know... I have my own style, my own position on such matters. I believe that I don't have the right to react emotionally. Because I must be able to work with everyone in the interests of my country. We need to work in a concerted effort with Russia to maintain peace in Europe. Peace in Europe is possible only with Russia. I think that today the cooperation of the world society with Russia is necessary. We must work closely to settle the crisis of identity. The crisis of fear of Europe of what is going on in the world. This is not the first time Russia has been faced with barbarous terrorist crimes - most of the time, without any apparent external or internal reasons. As was the case with the bomb attack at the Volgograd terminal at the end of 2013. We have not forgotten anybody or anything. The killing of our people over Sinai was among the bloodiest [comes] in terms of casualties. And we will not wipe away our tears. Not from our hearts and not from our souls. This will remain with us forever. But it will not stop us from finding and punishing the criminals. We must do this without any statute of limitations. We must know them all by name. We will look for them all wherever they may be hiding We'll find them in any part of the world and punish them. Perhaps the Islamic State is that absolute evil, which, in order to defeat, will require the entire world to unite and work out conditions. For a new Yalta [agreement] of sorts. The terrorist organization called the Islamic State is of course a major threat, and not only for us but also for the Islamic world itself. When we began this conversation you asked me how various countries reacted to this and I told you that even Sunni countries are afraid. Why? Because the so-called Islamic State has already laid claim to Mecca and Medina. They already want to create a Caliphate on an unprecedented scale there. In other words, they pose a threat to very many (countries) But this is not a key point around which future development revolves. The key to future development will be the building of relations in this so-called geopolitical struggle. The struggle is imminent. This is normal, but it should be conducted according to civilized rules, which should be — I'd like to reiterate this — civilized. Understandable, transparent, controlled and not subject to unilateral interpretation. Lord David Owen Minister of Foreign Affairs (UK, 1977-1979) Real statesmen always come back, make attempts again and again, search the way for peace. There is no sense in waiting, no sense in anger, in breaking contacts. This reason is greater than any human. And even greater than a country. Key players, key countries are more important for prosperity and peace in the whole world. They don't even need to pull together, or make friends with each other, but they can have a dialog. Maybe there are not many great leaders because the world doesn't need them. Because a leader is not a great phenomenon by himself. When a leader rises and states that he is great, he is strong, people say: Seriously? Can you stop terror? No. Can you stop the social differentiation? No. Why do you say that you are great? If you want to be great, do not lie to us. Serve us. And then you should feel like a servant, and not a leader. Then we will give you a chance. If the majority of the political leaders focus on making the world a fairer place, we will be able to advance this matter. This is my way of being optimistic. Some may call it naiveté. Moses did something unique. He preferred moral duty over all the wonders of the world - riches, beauty, power. It's not simple because morality is not a beautiful lady. And you cannot reach her. What you can do is to try. So you have a perfect goal with a very complicated road to it. But it has its advantages. Because you will never be satisfied. You will always try to reach the goal. And if you do not reach it, the very attempt to do so is morality. It forces you to look at the world differently. Completing our work on the film, we realized that we must meet with President Putin once again. The two meetings were only separated by two months, but a host of tragic events took place during this period. To talk with the President, we went to his residence. Thursday, December 17. 7:00 p.m. Mr. Putin, your recent remarks reflect a hint of personal disappointment. You have always hit your target, but lately you have started calling a spade a spade, and this creates the impression that the masks are off. Are the notions of honor, dignity and commitment to agreements still there? Are there global leaders with whom it is possible to come to terms on anything? With whom is it possible to build long-term relations if those who seemed like-minded only yesterday are stabbing us in the back today? What's Europe's problem? Why can't Europeans build their policy on reasonable, constructive, clear-cut and understandable principles? As for such notions as honor, dignity, love and integrity, it would be good to see them in politics, but they primarily form and should form the foundation of human relations - between men and women, and between people in general. Meanwhile, relations between countries are primarily governed by interests. For these interests to be - I'll use the word "balanced" again... it is essential to have some common rules that will be interpreted in the same way and applied transparently. Now, about those whom it is possible or impossible to deal with... I think it is possible to deal with anyone. And we have an obligation to deal with everyone whether we like them of not. We will work with everyone. You asked about Europe's problem. The problem is that Europe does not pursue an independent foreign policy - none altogether. In effect, Europe has renounced it and transferred part of its sovereignty - probably the most important part - to the bloc. As a matter of fact, this is fairly normal when members of a military-political bloc transfer part of their sovereignty to supranational bodies. However, in this case Europe transferred this part of its sovereignty not to a supranational body, and not even to NATO, but to NATO's leader - the United States. As you may recall, we have revisited this issue — Iraq and the US boots on the ground -- on many occasions. At that time, Germany headed by then Chancellor Schröder and France led by President Chirac objected to this move. I'll repeat that it wasn't me who persuaded them... They did! It wasn't me who persuaded them. They were trying to persuade me to join them. Later on, when the invasion took place and Saddam Hussein was killed and Iraq was destroyed, do you remember what they were told? Mind you, you were wrong. I was also told: so, we won, and you stayed on the sidelines. But if one looks a step ahead, it is clear that they were the ones who were right. It appeared that Chirac, a man of encyclopedic knowledge who had very close and trust-based relations with the Sunnis in the Middle East, had predicted the outcome back then. Now we are witnessing this outcome - the disintegration of statehood in these countries: thriving terrorism and Paris under attack. Chirac thought about these consequences, and he was right, just as Schröder was, too. We believe he is Russia's friend. But Schröder is not a pro-Russian, but a pro-German politician. In fact, he is an Atlanticist. He always told me bluntly and candidly in our private conversations about NATO's importance for modern international relations. I far from agree with him on all points, but such are his views. He never did anything that could damage the interests of his country. On the contrary, he always fought for these interests. Take the Nord Stream-1 project, for instance. You know, I was simply watching in disbelief how he was attacked when he initiated this project. In fact, Germany initiated it. Yes, we strongly supported him. Later on, he fought to get it implemented. Now everyone says: What a great job we've done! It was he who built it, not "we". Moreover, they've suggested that we should build Nord Stream 2. Everyone knows that it is Germany that needs it because it has decided to shut down all of its nuclear power plants and is unlikely to be able to reopen them. Russia has a vast amount of this environmentally safe raw material. And we are willing to supply it. So why should we turn down this proposal? By the way, this will also make Germany a European energy hub. But this is beyond the point. The thing is that we do not expect our European partners to give up their Euro-Atlantic allegiance. I think our European partners should not do so, but should take part at least in the decision-making process rather than simply blindly follow the instructions from overseas. Yes, everyone understands what consequences this had for Schröder and Chirac. However, it is important to be guided either by domestic political or government interests. It seems to me that the interests of the European countries - let them correct me if I'm wrong - is to pool efforts in the economy, politics, in fighting terrorism, environmental protection and in combating organized crime. Unite with Russia. We are willing to do this work, we are open to it. We are not going to pout over these sanctions. Everybody is welcome. Well, Turkey dared do such a thing. Turkey is not Europe. This is my first point. My second point is that, as I mentioned in my address to the Federal Assembly and I will say it again now, we consider the Turkish people our friends. And we don't want to see our relations with the Turkish people curtailed. With regard to the current Turkish leadership, Nothing is eternal under the moon. On the one hand, Europe, the United States and Russia joined forces to fight the international terrorist threat. On the other hand, these same partners have renewed their sanctions on our country, and occasionally even introduce more sanctions, What surprises me is that for the sake of fleeting political interests even the fundamental principles underlying the work of such seemingly stable and respected institutions as the International Monetary Fund... I'm referring to Ukraine. How would you... With regard to Ukraine and the post-Soviet space in general, I believe that the position adopted by our Western partners - Europe and the United States - is not based on protecting the interests of Ukraine, but stems instead from their attempt to prevent the re-establishment of the Soviet Union. No one out there wants to believe that we are not planning to recreate the Soviet Union. However, even the hypothetical possibility of joining our efforts amid today's economic integration processes would have certainly made Russia and Ukraine more competitive in the global economy and allowed Ukraine and Russia to take the place they deserve in the modern division of labor system on the global markets. Even the hypothetical possibility of such a scenario ever materializing is likely keeping our partners awake at night. I think their primary goal is to prevent this unification from ever happening. It is no secret. They did everything to prevent the creation of a common economic space and the Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. They are still reluctant to talk with the Eurasian Economic Union as a full-fledged participant in international affairs. For some reason, it's OK to create the EU, but creating the EAEU is a no-no. I believe that our partners are beginning to realize that this is a destructive position. Why support the coup in Ukraine? I'm asking this question for the hundredth time. I think that many of our partners see that they have made a mistake, but just won't admit. However, they took advantage of the discontent of the people who weren't happy with the way things were in Ukraine, not only under Yanukovych, but since Ukraine has gained independence as well. Corruption, poorly functioning judicial and law enforcement systems — they are much worse than ours. We are faced with a lot of problems, but things are even worse in Ukraine. Conceited bureaucrats annoyed people there beyond imagination. Of course, taking advantage of that situation was a cinch. Things cannot be improved by a coup d'état. Is it any better now? The power remains in the hands of oligarchs. The country was put under external administration. They brought all their key managers from neighboring countries. or even overseas. The standard of living is plummeting. Ukraine's GDP is down several fold. We've just mentioned that our GDP's down, but theirs is down tenfold. Ukraine is going through a total de-industrialization, What does it get in return? Maybe they'll provide them with visa-free travel to Europe. Maybe not. However, it's not about a work permit or a worker visa. Even if they were issued worker visas, what would they be doing there? Babysitting, landscaping or doing entry-level construction work? Is this the destiny and the future of a beautiful country such as Ukraine and a wonderful people such as the Ukrainians? Of course not. Ukraine has every chance to become a highly industrialized country with well-developed high-tech industries. Where is the racket-building industry, space exploration, aviation, shipbuilding, microelectronics, research and education? Where is all of that? Degrading. No one out there is wiling to contribute to the upkeep of Ukraine. Someone may give it a billion or two, others will promise to issue some kind of guarantees. Moreover, they want to shift the financial burden to Russia. They don't want to pay back their loans, even though we came up with a nice and comfortable debt solution. "Let's share the risks," we said. We are willing to structure our loan to Ukraine, whereby we'll put a hold on payments during the first year, and then go at a pace of one billion per year. What's wrong with that? They are unwilling to even share the risk. This means that they don't believe in Ukraine's solvency and its ability to stabilize its economy. That is bad news. Still, the IMF is changing the rules. It's not the United States that provides funding, but the IMF, all its member countries. That is, once again, they are shifting the financial burden for their political mistakes on the international financial community. They don't want to carry this load alone. However, I think that the realization that we must act within the scope of civilized rules rather than disregard them, should eventually come to everyone, if it's not coming already. We've heard and spoken about the Minsk agreements many times. This also applies to the renewal of Western restrictions on Russia. Look, are we the ones who are supposed to amend our Constitution? Of course not. Everybody understands everything perfectly well, but still think they need to turn up the heat an Russia, so that it gives ground here and there. It's not our business to move forward or push for anything. We believe that we cannot leave residents of southeastern Ukraine at the mercy of the nationalists. Not just the Russians living there, but all the Russian-speaking people there who look to Russia. We are not asking for too much by adapting such a position. As we both have noted, members of the Ukrainian commission on reforms are even cursing in Russian and their President is trying to pull them apart also using Russian. You know, its a good thing they are cursing in Russian rather than Ukrainian - that is, not in Georgian or Ossetian. It is simply ridiculous; it's a travesty when people from the Caucasus pose as greater defenders of the interests of Ukrainians than the Ukrainians themselves. As if having come from Georgia or being, to use modern parlance, second-generation migrants from Armenia or Ossetia they know better what Ukrainians need. Do these people from the Caucasus claim to know better what Ukrainians want? This is ludicrous. This would be funny if it weren't so sad. Sovereignty is the main topic of discussion. Whenever we talk about a new world order, our discussions revolve around sovereignty. That said, do fundamental principles still exist, or is it possible to change everything today, to betray everything for the sake of fleeting interests? You are talking about interests all the time, but you are acting based on different premises. Interests aside, you always honor your word and do not stray from this logic even in the most difficult moments. At the news conference, you spoke about complicated relations with Turkey, but despite this, you did not violate any agreements. And did not disclose what they were all about. Well, thank you for the compliment, but I'm indeed trying not to breach my commitments, not to go against the obligations this country has. You know we are doing thus not only out of some moral or ethical considerations, but for pragmatic reasons. It is more comfortable to work this way. Take the Syrian crisis, for one — we find it comfortable to work with President Assad, the US side, as well as our friends from Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. I mentioned this to President Obama. Why is it comfortable? We are not wagging our tail, and we are not changing our position. Before formulating it, we listened to everyone without any rush and chose an approach that, as it seems to us, is acceptable to all. To be more precise, it doesn't merely seem acceptable to us — we know that because we first asked them whether it's OK or not, whether they agree or not. In principle, all sides said "yes" on the major parameters of the settlement. Once they said "yes", we formulated our position on the basis of common and acceptable ideas. So now we don't have to jump like fleas from one side to another, pardon me for using that simile. We just don't have to do this. Our position rests on our dialogues, and that is making it strong. In addition to being open, our position is consistent and honest, and that's why it is strong. As for the foundations you mentioned - whether they exist or not - for the time being there are no other foundations than international law based on the UN Charter. The world is changing, of course. The UN Charter and the world order that's in place took shape after World War II. Now the balance of forces has obviously changed. And we must consider this, by all means. This is true. Take the Federal Republic of Germany, for one. All generations of Germans cannot feel burdened because of what the Nazis did. There were Germans who fought against the Nazis and were their first victims. There were also Christians and Communists and all kinds of other groups. The anti-Nazi movement was enormous. And this also gives us food for thought. I think I have the right to say this. And not only as President, the head of the Russian state, but also as a member of a family in which many died and were badly hurt during WWII. More relatives died on both my mother's and father's sides than survived World War II. If we want more stability in the current international situation we should take into account the role that Germany can and should play in the world arena... It is imperative to consider all these factors and enhance stability in developing international relations. You had a very emotional reaction to the act of terror over Sinai and the death of our servicemen in a later incident. It was evident that you took it to heart as a personal tragedy. When Paris came under attack, you were one of the first to call France. How much does this pain affect you and Russia's policy? Emotions are inevitable, but they should not affect the quality of decisions because the interests of millions upon millions of Russian citizens depend on them. Each decision must be well thought-out and produce positive mid- and long-term results. Mr. Putin, will there be war? Are you referring to a global war? I hope not. At any rate, this would be a planetary disaster in modern international conditions. I'd like to hope that there is no lunatic on Earth who'd dare use nuclear weapons. But as a deterrent, Russia will develop nuclear weapons as one of the leading nuclear powers. Our policy of nuclear security relies on the nuclear triad, but we have never and will never threaten anyone with our nuclear power. That said, our military doctrine assigns a befitting place and an appropriate role to it. Thank you, Mr. Putin.
