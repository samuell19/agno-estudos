(air whooshing) (thunder rumbles) - [Alex] The corona virus pandemic sparked extraordinary levels of stress amongst us all. Now, imagine what it's like for those who are already struggling with PTSD long before this began. Providing health to our veterans, this is Inside the Issues. Welcome to Inside the Issues, I'm Alex Cohen coming to you from my home. - [Speaker] It just brought back horrible memories of the day that I found out that my son Eric was murdered. I can feel their pain. I know what they're going through. - [Interviewer] You said you can't bring yourself to watch the video of George Floyd. - [Speaker] No, I can't. - [Interviewer] And yet it's the video that has opened a lot of other people's eyes. - [Speaker] Yes. 11 times he's repeated, I can't breathe, but the disconcerned officers, - I can't fucking breathe. - [Speaker] They paid no attention to his cries. They continued murdering him. And this is just like the sentiments of this young man who was killed the other day. The man was trying to only breathe. - [Alex] Now an outspoken activist, to bring justice for so many who have been hurt. - [Speaker] I don't want any other mother to suffer.

Because it's a long Dick? - Because it's black. - No, I have to say it didn't cross my mind. What crossed my mind initially was just a picture of a penis, which seems, I mean, if somebody's wheeling their four year old around here and the four year old says, mommy what's that? - If the four year old can read, I mean, come on. Then they're learning how to read. I think it's, I think it's great. We need to be doing something. I just don't have anything else to do. I just think that we need to be wearing our mask.

We had people come today that I have their number and all that. They, they want, they want us to like immediately jump up and we wanted to salvage stuff. - You guys do that. Right? - They were gonna pick you. They wanna take you right then and there, they had a room key. And you guys didn't go? - Um, yeah. We have a friend over there. He thinks that that people are being put in quarantine camps and we're all gonna be like shoved into one little zombie something or whatever. He just, he's paranoid. He's very paranoid. He, some of the things he says make sense, but he's been in Hollywood. (loud sounds drowning out radio coverage of George Floyd) - [Reporter On Radio] The bystander's cell phone recording Floyd's pleas. This is the second video of a black man dying to emerge in less than a month month. - [Man On Radio] Seeing Ahmaud Arbery killed by citizens while he's jogging, watching George Floyd be killed unarmed by police. All of these incidents mesh to- (rain sounds drowning out radio) (humming) (birds chirping) - [Man On Radio] But starting a few years ago, we started giving out medals for de-escalation for successfully saving lives to show that that was the highest responsibility that we had. Not just saving lives that somebody shooting at strangers. But a moment when you could take someone's life, what did you do to make sure that wasn't the end of it. So sure, here in California, across this nation there's things to do, but right now. - For Harry, right? - Yeah. - Bye. - How's the quarantine treating you? - Ah, it's okay. - Like it? - It's brought peace, spirituality. It's like the earth needed to breathe, sort of attack the human lung. - A little spiritual cleansing huh. - Yeah. - To me it all feels like a little racial cleansing. - Yeah. (vibration sounds) I will bless you. Bless you. And I forgive you. And you shall be forgiven. (Harry humming) - Do you think there's gonna be a second wave? - Yeah. Unfortunately. I mean, I just don't know. No sports. The whole going to the movie thing, you know. How much further we got now? - I'm sorry? - How much further do we got? - About another couple of miles. - A couple of miles. I don't really like being in this neighborhood. - You don't like it? - Not really. - Well, it's up above Olly. - Yeah. It's a little bit to, - But the air is clean. - The air is clean. Have you ever had a slice of hummingbird cake? - No. - It's a Southern thing. In the middle, there's caramelized butter, nuts. (Caddy speaking slowly and distorted) (ominous music plays) (growling) (ominous music plays) (birds chirping) - Hey. - Hi there. - Hey you guys. - Hey, how are you doing? - Jack. - How have you been? - Can I offer you a light refreshment? - I would love a drink and I got the real poison here for later. Do you mind if I keep it chilled? - For sure. - Let me just put it in the fridge. - Beetle juice. - Yeah. (Harry laughing) - Perfect. - (indistinct) Please forgive me. - Honey. Honey? Todd. Yeah. You're leaving? - Yeah. Hold on. I'll be back. I'm just gonna, I got the text. I can't. I gotta go, right? I know you're upset. You introduced me to this. You're a part of this too. - Yeah, I know. - Okay. I'm not dictating all the rules. I can show you the text. - I don't need to see the text. I don't need to see a text. - It specifically says come alone. - I don't need to see it. - You would've received one of these texts. So I don't want to call. - It's on you. If it's not what you say. This is on you. - Right? Well, before this, you were trying to get me to even accept this. And now that I am accepting this allow me the freedom to go to school. - I am so glad that you are, please hear me on that. So glad you are. Have fun. Breathe. Don't forget to breathe. From here. (Todd mumbling) - That's right. - Have you been working pretty steady during this time or? - No man, one day I said, hey, why not put this car to good use? I wanted to see how people are behaving during this time, you know. - Oh. So you've only been driving since the quarantine? - One day. - Wow. - This is the day. So anyway, if I sit still, you know, I mean, it's gonna get like suicidal or something. So I figure if I get. - What's that? - Don't worry about me. I'm okay. You know, times like this, you go through some fucking weird affirmations. - I think everybody's going through that brother. - Well, everybody's lost money, man. That's what I keep telling people. I had a guy in my car said, man, you know how much money I've lost this year? I said every, it's not, it's not personal, dude. Everybody's lost something. Okay. 2020, what the fuck. Sounded so optimistic. And not only that, some people, but like they're gone. You know what I mean? (ominous music plays) - You know, I found this guy, Harry, is somebody my wife introduced me onto. And I gotta say. - Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold on, Harry, Harry. That was the first guy I drove up here. Okay, strange guy. - That's interesting. But my Uber came right through to you. Right? - You know what? I, I, he did something that was involved. He had just set it all up. - Let me show you some videos I took this morning. People are crazy. Oh no. You don't want to see that. - Who do you follow on your Instagram. Are you one of those creepers? - She's just a friend. - That like your grandson or something? - Look, you see, let me step far back. If- - You, have a mustache! (woman laughing) - I had no idea you had a mustache. - I just, it's funny. I just didn't know that you had a mustache. - Well, exactly. People see this, they swipe left, but they see that they swipe right. And I actually end up being friends with somebody, and then we talk and then they, they, they, you know, we get on and I mean, I don't know. They may not be who they, who they look like. All right. I shouldn't have told you anything. - I mean, you seem to be okay, but. - Well put it like this. You're the first person I've found who actually has a similar mindset. - I like the mustache. You know, really, you should just be yourself. - It's never worked. - I don't understand why, why? Like that's, what's wrong with, excuse me. That's what's wrong with society today is that people aren't okay with themselves. And don't don't care about other shit. Yeah. So if you just cared, I don't know, about yourself more than other people, then you wouldn't have to do that. (bells chiming) (knocking) - Hello? I'm Todd. - Bless you. Today, when I woke up, I noticed this nest, outside my kitchen door and I've been watching birds fearlessness over the last couple of weeks. And I heard all the little birds cheeping with joy and happiness that obviously just broken free from the egg and walked away. And then I heard a real kerfuffle and it was a blue Jay and the blue Jay had gone into the nest and killed all the new little baby birds. He ripped them apart, feathers were moving everywhere. Parts of the nest were destroyed and the mother and the father were looking on. I wouldn't say horror, because nature is a certain way. They were looking on in panic, in despair. And the blue Jay was happy and the blue jay ate the birds and flew away. Let's join the cosmic dance of destruction. (everyone laughing) - Now we'll have a little elixir. - What's in that Harry? 'Cause my son's gonna do it. - Oh, your two sons. - Yeah. Well, he's done it before. He's the younger. - I ask for forgiveness and gift giveness. I ask for forgiveness and gift giveness. I ask for forgiveness and gift giveness. I ask for forgiveness and gift giveness. Return your glasses. - Siri, can you please text Harry and ask him, what time should I be there? - [Siri] It's time for you to leave. Your car is here.

What? - Hopefully they have sex. - Yeah. You know, I saw this thing on Portland porn once where this chick was having dope me parties. And she would buy like some body weed and massage shit. People get on the couch and they all wrestled together and you're supposed to ask permission. Like, I'm gonna put my hand on your knee. Okay. I'm gonna touch your shoulder. Okay.

I don't shame them or anything like that. - No. - But, but I just think that. - The detectives- - They're not taking it seriously. No, no, no. I've just been calling over there and I talk to someone for a while and they hang up on me 'cause they think, oh, in that case. Jesus. - You know this has been a pretty strange day as we. I think there's some sort of gathering going on. I mean, some sort of like hipster or some sort of anti quarantine fuck everybody else party. - Oh Caddy. That's a great idea. I should go there. And if I call the police from there, - Then you'll have the evidence right behind you. - Exactly. - In your state, I think that's better than trying to barge in there. I have the last address still on my phone. 'Cause literally I've dropped fucking four people off there. - I don't want to get you in trouble. - I don't give a shit.

At our age, you lucky we get what we get. As long, as long as they don't have to take their teeth out.

Yeah. - 'Cause then you had to adjust her hips and knees. (Arthur laughing) Shoulder popped out. (Caddy laughing) Was that my motherfucking turn. Ah fucking son of a motherfucker. - I'll be quiet. - It's right here. It's right here. I've taken it so many times. I should have know it with the back of my hand. There it is. But you be careful.

(ominous music plays) - You do realize this is not very safe, don't you? - Optimism. - Yes. - Yes - Yes. - Cheers to that. - Optimism. - Optimism. - I'm still a little worried. - Do you want a hug? - No for god's sake. - I'm going to give you a hug. - No, please don't. - Okay. All six feet apart then sir. - Six. If that's okay. - I can still give you a hug. - Well, let's do the numbers. I mean, the statistical possibilities of me actually catching something. Versus the statistical possibilities of me getting laid. I think I might go for the latter at the end of the day. So, I will give you a hug. - Cheers to that. Aw, a little pat on the back. I love that. Oh I didn't know that. Oh wow. You just told me something I didn't know. I might not know. - Hello. - Oh gosh. You were the one with the wonderful mask. - Todd Ackerman. - Todd Ackerman. - Todd fucking Ackerman. - Now wait a minute. That name rings a bell. That name rings a bell. Oh my god! You're Todd Ackerman. That's Todd Ackerman. I do apologize, Todd. It took a moment for me to wrap my head around it. - Oh no worries. - Of course. - No worries. - You're wonderful. - Thank you. Thank you Thank you. Thank you very much. - Oh my gosh. - This isn't really very good. Is it? - Look in the mirror. Oh, you want kiss me? I'm so pretty. - [Harry] Let's experience. Let's experience this beautiful, beautiful tunnel. This tunnel of despair, this dark dark hole. Black hole that we have to go through. - I've seen you looking at me the whole night. - Can you pass me that candle? - [Harry] Come out and floss and float so hard. - This one? - Yeah. - So tell me how long have you two known each other? I'm just interested. - Um, well. - Are you fucking police? - It's safe to say we're new friends. (woman laughing) Or a vogue. It's a vogue. You know I used it while travel. - My wife smokes vogues. - Oh, oh, you have a wife. - You have a wife. - He has a wife. You have a wife. - Sh, how about a kiss, a kiss again. - Will you kiss me? - MM-hm. - In my world at the moment, people wouldn't be doing that. - Dancing? Feeling good? - Hugging. - Oh, because we're gonna catch a virus. - Yes. - What if the virus is not real? What if there is no virus. - From where you are? You just, everything is invincible. There is no way you can be touched. You're in that beautiful part of life, which I wish I was still in, but I'm not. And I never will be again, but there are people around me who I love. Who have gone or are going. - Okay, you're afraid of death. - Yes. And I'd be a liar to say that I'm not. And so would you. - Did you practice that speech? - No. - Good speech. - In my mind, I prefaced it, and on my web page I've written it a couple of times. - Did you get any comments? - Yes lots of comments. She doesn't like me. - Come follow me. (Harry howling) - [Radio] Police force. We are getting some reinforcements in from Ventura county. The national guard- - Cecil! - [Radio] What will really help is if more people observe the curfew and get off the streets. And frankly, if the people who are bent on doing destruction here, end up stopping. (melancholy music playing) There are legitimate reasons for quarantines and the grievances and complaints and just wrongs that need to be addressed. And what we're seeing here is a tragic result of that. (sirens wailing) (vibrating sounds) - I love this one. Discover it. No this room. - Is that good? Some crazy shit. This is crazy. There's. - Oh. - How's that? - Oh. - Come with me. - I got you. I got you. - Oh. - Ah, fuck me, Jesus. - Hi Todd. Hi. - Hey babe. - Hi. - Where's your mask? - Harry didn't want the mask. - Harry didn't want a mask? - No, it's not. I mean, we were just like chill. - You're doing yoga. - I drank lot. - I'm fine. - It's okay. We're just friends. - No, chill, chill. - What's your name? - Clara. - Clara. Clara's your name? - Yeah. What's your name? It's very nice to meet you. - I actually, honey, I was eating this. - Can you find your mask? And can you put it on? You don't know her? I don't know her. - Babe nobody has a mask on. - Nobody has a mask on here. Why does nobody have a mask on here? Ask Harry you, you're the one that introduced me to him. - So is he the boss of you? - You introduced me to him! - I know I did, but you know what? There's absolutely no social distancing going on over here. - Obviously not. And how did you even find me? I was invited by Harry, who you introduced me to. - That has nothing to do with it. - Cool. - I showed up. I always know how to find you. - I'm eating the sandwich. I'm not fucking, I'm not doing anything. I'm just, she was giving- - You're in a closet with a woman with no bra. - Hey, Hey. Just so you know, if you just give me a second. - I really have nothing to say to you. I really need to speak to my husband. - If you just give me a second and I'll leave. Okay? I just want to tell you, that we are here trying to be very nicely lovely, connected to the higher purpose that we're talking about. And it's nothing, nothing, nothing sexual at all. - That's right, why you were on this lap. Anyway. - Have you ever heard about gymnastics and stretching your body? - Yes. - Babe. - I do know all about that because I do it every day. - Not cool that you don't trust me. - I didn't need to see your text because I have been trusting you. But for Christ's sake. - Babe, I am fucked up and I can't do this right now. - What are you fucked up on? - I don't know. Ask fucking Harry. - Can you just answer your own questions? Does everything have to filter through Harry? - We drank something, babe, we're doing our fucking thing. The thing you taught me. - What is that fucking thing? - And I drink this thing and I'm fucked up. I mean, stop. Stop. - Is that why I was- - Stop! - Because there's a girl on your lap and you wanted to have the freedom to have a girl on your lap. (Todd shouting) And that's why you haven't been at home for the last five fucking nights because of- (Todd screaming) - Stop! - Yes. Stop it because we're not bad people. We didn't want it. - He's been sober for a year. Can you tell me what he's been taking? - Can I tell you one thing? - I don't need to talk to you right now. You have no mask on. - But you have one on, don't you think you're hot stuff. - And there's a fucking pandemic going on for Christ's sake. - Here's the deal. I'm changing locations. I'm going to smoke a cigarette. You calm down woman. Never ending shit. Yeah. Tonight's a night that Harry designed and I came for it. So just if you want to ask Harry about his hidden plan for this evening and why you weren't invited, we've always been invited to the events before. Please do. - You can't even ask him. - Please ask him. - This is embarrassing, - But I can't talk about it now. I love you though. - There's absolutely no social distancing. - I'm sorry. I just wanted to tell you one thing, one thing. This is my boyfriend Sydney and we love each other very much and we would never, I would never. And he knew that we were doing yoga. - I would love you to talk to Harry who designed this event. It's not- - Do you have a drink. - No, I do not. - Why won't you have a drink? You will help relax a little bit. - Get Harry to fucking give you something to drink. - You have no idea what the hell you're doing right now. - If you can relax, right now. - If you're gonna be here, you're taking the fucking drink. - Maybe there's a chance- - I'll have a Vodka Stoli please with cranberries. You can get it for me, honey. You can get it for me. - He wants, he wants, he just wants freedom- - I don't need you to tell me about what he wants. Can you, do you have a mask that you could put on and be responsible? - May I intervene here. How are you? How are you? - You don't know how hard it's been to keep him straight. It's like- - He's had a little whiskey. - where's your wife and your baby Harry? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're all my wives. You're all my wives. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm gonna take you away. Yeah. We're on our way back home. Oh. Where's the- Where's the push. - Harry I don't understand. It's just like some kind of double standard. We were meditating to you today in our house in Malibu. And, and it was so beautiful and there were, no here, you're missing. You're missing the, please Harry put the, put it down. - Yeah. Stay. Drink. (Harry giggling) - Drink. - It's like you're leading a double life. You know? Where's your wife? Your wife? - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Who are you? - It's okay. I'm just playing. - Hello? Can I order some food please? Oh yes. Let me get it. Four portions of Singapore noodles, some special fried rice, three portions lemon soup, top top gai soup. Three of those. And what are your fish dishes. Okay. You got two of those and what specials do you have? No. Yeah, with tofu, three of those and yeah like a chicken noodle. Yeah. Perfect. Two of those. And you could deliver it. Perfect. Perfect. They're wearing masks I hope and gloves too. - It's all right. The night is coming. I guarantee you that. The night is fucking coming. (upbeat dance music playing) - Harry. I never thought of you like this. This is a revelation for me. - I'm glad to hear that. - Well, I it's a numbers game, I suppose, but I do have to try and cancel something that I'd set up earlier in trouble. (Harry laughing) - Well, I'm not sure how I feel about that. - Well, I- - Oh, I think it should be more than the present. (Harry humming) - Oh I'm sure I could catch. (Harry shouting and growling) - I'm in now. I was just in the process of calling off a police raid and I don't - Fuck you. Fuck you. - Well, fuck you, silly, man. - What the fuck is going on? - You grotesque, horrible vermin. - Dares, dares, come hear a monster and do this fucking shit.

Listen I'm so sorry calling you this late. Listen. I wonder if you can help me. Did you, did you actually call, did you actually call for the police? - Yeah, I called the police, but they're not coming. I mean, there's, there's a riot going on. Are you okay? Like where, where are you? There's a curfew. - [Voice On TV] Police department Michael Moore said what happens tonight really depends on the citizens of Los Angeles on what we can do and what we will allow to happen. His officers, there are 9,000 of them, but that is not enough to be everywhere. They literally can't be everywhere. Half of them are gonna work one shift. Half of them are gonna work the other 12. - Oh, we going to be to closing. - Are you gonna, are you gonna keep the building? - No, this is not belong to us. - Oh. - This is to rent. Yeah. - Then once everything comes back, you're gonna have the same setup. - Yeah. We're gonna have the same setup, but it might be far away. Because it's still early, you know? - They're coming back to soon. - Yeah. I want make sure that everyone's safe. That's why, you know, I tell all employee, you can get the food from here that you don't have to go out. - [Speaker On TV] There are legitimate reasons at the core of this, there are legitimate grievances. - Yeah. This is the temple in my hometown or what my heart had on the qu Camara. And 12 year I send the money on my part of tip to the poor kid in my high school. And my mom's school was 80 scholarship for money under his name. Nobody know who send the money until now. And now the restaurant closed. I don't have money. The kid, I feel so much. You know. - You sure we got the right sauces at the right bag? - Yeah, it did. The, the, no, not that much. This one might be. - That's separate order. - Yeah. It separate. Yeah. - See you next week. - Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Send me the message. Yeah. - [Speaker On TV] 5:30 in the morning city Metro buses, county buses were destroyed. (sirens wailing) (Caddy whispering) (drumming) - [Harry] Mother, Father, write your own script. You can write your own way. You can be the victim. Or you can be the hero. You are your own path. Hey! What does it mean? - It means, nothing.

They'll sleep. Sleep and go into that gentle good night. - I don't know. But that sounds permanent to me. - It's not all permanence. (Harry laughing) - You're kidding? - No I'm not. I'm not kidding you.
