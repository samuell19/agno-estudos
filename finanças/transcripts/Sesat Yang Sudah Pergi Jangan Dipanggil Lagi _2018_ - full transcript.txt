Mom? Amara eats a lot of eggs. Won't she get ulcers? Amara is going to be an athlete. She needs a lot of protein. I won against the future national athlete. You wish. I finished, you cheated. Excuses. Morning, honey. Ew, honey! Go take a shower. Yummy. I'll go shower. Mom… I don't want it. Dad promised me avocado toast today. I want avocado toast, too! We'll have avocado toast next week. Your dad has to deliver brownies today. People are waiting. Can't you deliver them? Do you have to eat avocado toast today? Everybody, calm down! I'll make you avocado toast later. Delicious, right? Can you not be so sulky? I'm losing followers. Your mom was very sulky. A lot of guys used to tease her. So why did she end up with you? It's simple. I was the most handsome. Remember his hair? I already gave you money. It's to buy bras. Can't you call it undergarments or whatever? Thanks! Dad. Last week you already bought… -those. -It's not for bras. For avocado toast, you promised. Oh, right. Sorry, Amara. Listen. I'll pick you up this afternoon and we'll get some avocado toast, okay? Relax, Dad. I'm not angry. I know you have to follow Mom's orders to avoid drama! Mara. Wait for me later, okay? I will definitely pick you up. Congratulations, Amara! You won another marathon? Congratulations! You're awesome. Hello, Dad? Grandpa. Do I really have to move here? It's good for your mother… if you all move to the village. It's quiet. Your mother can calm herself here. BEREMANYAN VILLAGE Grandpa. Why are the villagers all old? Grandpa, grandpa! Hi. Move over there. Okay. So you've been living here alone for three years? Yes, to finish my novel. I'm so happy that you're finally writing. It's gonna be great. Yes. Oh no. There's no reception. Come on, this is your house. There's a well in this forest? Pardon? That thing, Grandpa. That is in this forest, right? The well? Forests are all the same. Kasih. Your room is over here. This is Kasih's room. Amara, you're over here. Mara. I have a secret. Something that brings me joy whenever I'm sad or angry. Do you want to know? Look. First… put some music on. Then… you find a mirror… and do this. However sad I am, whenever I see the reflection of my butt, I become happy immediately. Greetings to those that are seen and unseen. Accept this whoever you are. Whatever you are. Whether or not you believe in my greeting. My greeting from my heart. Come with beauty. Move to greet and feel. Until you are fulfilled. Then be calm and follow your wish. Be calm and gentle. Because I am a powerful human… with a soul that greets you from within my pure heart. Salt, myrrh, all the fragrances. Inhale with satisfaction. Return to the ocean from which you came. Because now I am night and day that fills the small and great universe with limitless affection towards all of you. Grandpa! Don't you have an internet connection? No. I need to focus on writing and researching to finish my novel. Do you not use the Internet when doing research? If I use the Internet I end up not researching. It's better that I walk around this village seeing everything by myself. That is why I am here. You're writing about this village? Is it about… those weird noises during sunset? What weird noises? Those scary noises, Grandpa. Scary? Those spells can actually make you feel calm. All right. I'll promote you on my YouTube channel. But you have to pay me. You're a natural. Earning money at such a young age! How about Amara? Amara is an athlete, Grandpa. When she wins, she gets a huge prize. Oh, right. When are you running again, Amara? I'm no longer in the team, Grandpa. What? Why? Because I just moved here. I'm already full. What's wrong? Can I sleep with you? I thought you're all grown up? Still scared to sleep on your own? I miss Dad. Is this my necklace? You wish. It's mine. It's typical of Dad. He kept buying us the same stuff. He doesn't want to treat us differently. Hey. Don't you miss Dad? If you were given a chance to speak to him for the last time… what would you say? I would ask for some money to buy bras. That never fails, buying bras. Anyway, what's up with Dad and bras? Bras, bras, bras. Maybe it's like… When I heard him say, "I love you," or something like that, it sounded lame. Use other words. Be creative. What about you? If you were given another chance to talk to Dad… what would you say? Kasih? Kasih? Damn it! Kasih! What is it? I found an internet connection! Where? In grandpa's office. Why do you think grandpa refuses to share the Internet? He's so stingy. Maybe he has a low limit. GOLD FOUND IN BEREMANYAN RIVER LONG DRAUGHT, ONLY BEREMANYAN HARVESTS CROPS BEREMANYAN FREE FROM ROBBERS PLAGUE SPREADS EXCEPT IN BEREMANYAN It's grandpa! Goodness. Clear. I bumped my head. -Does it hurt? -Of course! HOW TO GRANT YOUR WISH THROW A VALUABLE ITEM INTO THE WELL COLLECT BLOOD IN A SAJEN BOWL Young lady? Don't go in there. You'll get lost. -Let's go. -Hurry. Your school is far away, near the town. I have a lot to send out at the post. Come on. Are you scared? You shouldn't be scared. The children in this little town are nice. A lot of them would love to be friends with you. Use this, so you won't feel as scared. It looks cool on you. And you? I'm already cool. My name is Amara. Your full name. Just Amara, sir. Oh, like Adel? I don't know who Adel is, sir. That's fine. Take a seat. We will have a test next week. I want all the girls with long hair like this… to tie up their hair. I don't want to see any hair let down during the test. I don't know who Adel is either. He's lying. He knows all the words to Adele's songs. Oh, he meant Adele. By the way, I'm Sri Mutya Ekawati Putri Dewi. -You can call me Mutya. -Amara. You can call me anything. "Babe" is fine, too. -Where are you headed? -Beremanyan. That village used to worship Beremanyan, a ghost of the well. That's why it's called Beremanyan Village. Sounds like a cult. It was a long time ago, before they had a religion. Why did they worship Beremanyan? Beremanyan… can grant wishes. -What kind of wishes? -Anything, I guess. What about talking to the dead? Is that possible? If it can grant you wealth… surely it can let you talk to the spirits. I also wanted… to wish for a girlfriend. But the ritual hasn't been performed in a long time. Maybe no one knows how to do it anymore. Since, if we're talking about demons, nothing comes for free. The last chief of the village had to pay for it. The village lost its descendants. His child died. And his wife… went mad. So I can ask Beremanyan. I don't want to have kids. I… don't want to have kids either. So, Mom… once we become partners, we can get ten million a month. Right. But don't forget, the finals are coming soon, okay? But I don't want to go to high school, Mom. I want to focus on YouTube. If you don't go to school, what kind of work will you be doing? I can still work. I can attend the finals the next year. And then I can go to college. Why aren't you eating, Amara? -Do you not like the village food? -I don't feel like eating, Grandpa. Amara. Finish your meal. I don't feel like it, Mom. Amara. You need to eat. I noticed that you haven't eaten these past few days. I don't want to, Mom. Then what do you want, Amara? What do you want, Amara? How can I give you what you want if you don't even know what you want? -Amara! -I wish Dad was still alive, not you. Mom? -Oh my God! -I'm sorry! -My child! -Sorry. -I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. -My child. My child. Oh, my child. I don't understand why Amara hates me so much, Dad. I know it's wrong for me to move here. But what else can I do? Ever since I had Amara, I have never worked. I'm totally useless, Dad. I will take you to see my friend tomorrow. He can help you get a job. Greetings to those that are seen and unseen. Accept this, whoever you are. Whatever you are. Whether or not you believe in my greeting. My greeting from my heart. Come with beauty. Limited by the greatness of the universe. Move to greet and feel until you are fulfilled. Then be calm and follow your wish. Be calm and gentle. I wish to talk with my dad for the last time. Ready? Let's go! -Did you even shower? -Of course I did. You stink. -Really? -Here. -Stop it. -Here. Spray some more. Mom. Why is everyone staring at me like that? Mom? 12th GRADE, ISLAMIC HIGH SCHOOL Dad? Dad! Dad! Ra, what's wrong? Ra? What is it? Go. Go away. -Here. -No. Go away. Haven't been picked up yet? Can you get me a bike taxi? I lost my phone. I'll take you home, all right? Stop. Here is fine. You won't let me drop you at home? Afraid you might give in to my charms? All right. I'd better go, it's getting dark out here. Okay. Thanks for taking me this far. No problem. I like you anyway. -Bye! -Take care. What do you want? You shouldn't have summoned him! Grandpa. Mom didn't pick me up. I hope she picked up Kasih. If she is angry and no longer wants to pick me up, she should've told me. Kasih got picked up. You're the one who was unreachable. I lost my phone. Enough, go see your mother. She had an accident. She broke her leg. Mom? Mom? Amara? -Yes, Grandpa? -You can drive, right? Yes, but it's been a while since I did. Take the car to school tomorrow and drop off your sister. Can't you drive us? I am getting very inspired. I have to keep writing my novel. Kasih? Where's Mom? The bathroom, maybe? Mom? What's wrong? Amara! If we're late, I can't do the homework in class. Are you scared? So you can be cool again. Am I not already cool? Not now. Now? Amara! So you're going vintage? What a snob. She thinks she's so pretty. I got you this. To give you a ride home. I have a car. You don't always have to bring your car, right? Or we can eat? You do eat, right? -Mut! Let's hang out! I got this for you! -As if. Hang on a sec. I wonder why… all the pretty girls are mean to us. It's because they're pretty and happy. If they're in trouble or sad… then they will need us. Bullshit. -Say it to my face, if you dare. -What? What the hell? -What the hell? -Come with us! -What the hell? -Just get in. MUTYA THE WANNABE PRETTY WITH HER LOPSIDED ASS MUTYA THE WANNABE HIP BUT JUST WANNA BE NOTICED Mut, she's talking trash about your dad. What are you gonna do? MUTYA THE WANNABE RICH WITH HER EMBEZZLER DAD I have been nice to you since the beginning. Why are you talking trash about me? -And you even talked trash about my dad! -It wasn't me! Who would say 'filthy rich'? That's Jakartan slang. No, don't lie. Rian told me everything. So, it's just because Rian turned you down? Right? Don't be such a cheap girl. How pretty. PRETTY MUTYA THE WANNABE PRETTY WITH HER LOPSIDED ASS MUTYA THE WANNABE HIP BUT JUST WANNA BE NOTICED MUTYA THE WANNABE HIP BUT JUST WANNA BE NOTICED Hey! It's been a while since the bell rang. Come to the next class. But there's a test right now. Well, you shouldn't have been late. Leave. Mutya! -What's happening here? -Mutya! Wait! Mutya, what are you doing? Mutya! Mutya! -Rian! -Mut! Rian! Rian! Open up! What did you tell Mutya about me? Rian! Open up! Amara? Did you lock me in? You locked yourself in. Such a coward! Amara! Open up! Rian! Open it! Rian! Open up! Rian? Rian? Rian? Help me. What is that? Mom. Mom. Mom, I'm so sorry. You're here because of me. Forgive me. You don't have to apologize. If I could choose… I would also rather have your dad alive. But that's impossible. The Beremanyan ritual. Did you perform it? Because of it, Mom is hurt. How do I stop it? Grandpa. Grandpa. How do I stop it? I have done research here for years. Nothing can stop it. It's been a long time since anyone performed the ritual. I would pay them, but they refused. I wanted to do it myself… but I was afraid. -Until you did… -Amara? Are you okay? I'm fine. Sorry, I forgot to pick you up. Forgot? Yes, I completely forgot. What do you want? It's my treat. I'll buy you anything. No need. I shouldn't have relied on you so much. What do you mean? You always ask for people's attention. You always feel that no one gives you attention. Kasih. But have you paid any attention to them? -Kasih. -To Mom? To me? -To Dad? -I know you're angry, but don't say that to your sister. -Now you know how it feels. -Kasih, don't get angry! Why not, Grandpa? Can't I be the one who's angry? Kasih! -Amara! -Not her, please. Amara! Amara! I'm fine. Amara! Grandpa, take care of Mom and Kasih. Granny! Granny! Granny, help me! How do I stop this? Please help me! Granny! Ma'am! Please, ma'am! How do I stop Beremanyan, ma'am? You shouldn't have awakened him! You shouldn't have! Ma'am! Ma'am! For years… everyone has lived in fear. Nobody dared to summoned Beremanyan. Why… didn't this village prosper in the hand of Beremanyan? We can't ask for prosperity! We… can only… …ask for the doom of others. Beremanyan… …doesn't grant wishes. Beremanyan… hurts the people we do not like. LANDSLIDE KILLS 25 PEOPLE When we… asked for it to stop… we had to pay the price. Our children… were thrown into the well by Beremanyan. Please. How can I stop this? Please help me. Tell me, ma'am. Beremanyan can't be stopped. Unless… you sacrifice yourself. Everyone wants something. And no one wants to pay the price. I don't want anyone else to get hurt! Stop! If you sacrifice the necklace… Beremanyan will punish you! He will go after what you love. I have to tell the others. Kasih! Kasih! Kasih! Kasih! Kasih, snap out of it! Stay still! Kasih, no! Kasih? Are you all right? -It hurts. -Here, I'll help you. I'm sorry. Slowly, slowly. Grandpa! Wait here, I'll get the bandages upstairs. STERILE HYDROPHILIC GAUZE Here, here. Keep doing this, I'll go check on your mother. Amara! Hurry! Amara! -Hurry! -Grandpa! -Grandpa! -Amara! Grandpa! Take Mom to… -Grandpa! -Amara! Help! -Mom? -Help! Here, the flashlight. Amara! Grandpa! Mom! -Stay here. -Amara, please! Wait here, I'll come and get you. Mom? Amara? What's going on? Mom? Amara? Whose voice is that? Amara! That's not me! Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Amara! -Kasih! -Amara! Mom? Mom! Kasih broke her leg, Mom. Come on. Let's go there! Kasih! Mom! Kasih? Mom! Mom! Kasih! When we asked for it to stop… our children… were thrown into the well by Beremanyan. Kasih! Mom! I don't want anyone else to get hurt! Hold her up! Come on! Keep holding her! Come here, child. Let her rest. -Take it easy, Mom. -All right. Kasih? What's wrong? It's fine, I'll take those. You can go to the car. LOST WRITTEN BY ANWAR The sun had not fully risen. Amara threw the necklace from her father into the well. Hoping that Beremanyan would grant her wish. Amara did not realize… that Beremanyan can only hurt those who enrage her. He can't grant wishes. But rage and sadness… often come at the same time. One by one, the people Amara loved were attacked. Beremanyan can only be stopped if she sacrifices herself. Grandpa. Everyone is ready. You can go. We're taking different cars. I'll finish this up first, okay? You sure you want to move? Don't you need any more research? There's no need. Because you finished the novel. Is that why? What a coincidence. Thanks to me. Mom. Kasih. Everyone almost died because of this.
