U.S.A. Well! It's real buddy! I know! Good stuff! If you need more, call me! Sure! CIA, Morton Scott. Don't move! It's fake! Where did you get these? I don't know what are you talking about. You?! So you don't understand English... What about Chinese? Morton! Leave him to me! Whatever you say, Betty! I'm CIA Agent Betty Lee. Wait! What's my charge? Am I guilty, carrying money? No one cares what or how much you carry. But when the US dollars are forged, you're in trouble. You really have guts. I give you a chance. If you fight me off, you can leave. If you lose, you got to come with me! You will regret this! Shit: Get up! Your poor hand! You lost! Lose, fuck you! Don't fuck with me! Are you alright? I'm okay! Wanna move? You're finished! She was the Karate Champion last year! Shit: You're deep in it 2 JAPAN Boss hasn't finished yet. He must have great fun. But it's already half a day. - Maybe the girl doesn't let him go! - What a slut! Boss should have finished. Maybe the boss has been killed by the girl. L-long K0118 Brother Long! Long, welcome! Long, you're really on time. I would like to introduce you... To Mr. James. This is Long! Long, make yourself home. Jack?'-! Help me! What an asshole! Don't go, it's dangerous! John! - Ling, you leave first! - No, I must stay with you. Michael, help me! Quick! Up! Quick! Michael! Michael! Even now you don't trust me? I only trust myself in this business. This is your Christmas present. I bought it in France. Where is my money? What are you doing? Come on, get hold of yourself. In our business... You shouldn't think about the past. You're right. But I wouldn't be here without the past. Look! You're drunk. Your hands are shaking. I like booze and guns. I used to get drunk after I finished a job. I get blind drunk... Now I've dropped the gun because of the bottle. You can stop drinking. Ling! You're now on the way I used to be. Come on, we're in the same boat. When I left Vietnam, it was Rain Season. Vietnam, ah, republic! Fuck, forget it! Right! That time you killed Long, you did a really good job. It should be done in that way. It is like when you have a dog... You won't expect it to shit in your house... And clean up the shit for you. Right! I do like the way you are. This is your next job. JAPAN Merry Christmas! So, how about my French, sister? To pass you this photo... I specially bought this music box. And this is your Christmas present. It's now snowing in Paris. We'll have a white Christmas this year. But it isn't like having Christmas in Vietnam. We had coconut milk to drink. If you can come to France for Christmas, it'll be great. You can visit my school... And I'll introduce you to my girlfriend. She's beautiful and nice. You'll like here. Why haven't I heard of you having a boyfriend? Try to dress up a bit, or you won't find a husband. It's about time for school. Talk to you next time. MANILA It's so busy in this period. Why are there so people going to the States? Betty, I am sorry for keeping you wait. Let me introduce, he is from the CIA. - Hi, how are you doing? - This is lieutenant Jackson. Let's sit down first. Okay! Lieutenant Jonathan is working on the smuggling case. Forged U.S. dollars from the Philippines to the States. Do you have any information on hand? According to my investigation... There are some bad sheep in the U.S. Army. They use the immunity rights to trade in the forged dollars. Market price is one dollar for ten forged ones. Everybody on the streets know that! As far as I know, this shipment is worth... Three hundred fifty million. We're not only talking about the economic loss here. From the CIA point of View... I just want to tear the organization down. All available information is here. This guy Wong Shana isn't a small fish. Where does he come from? He's a triad boss from the Philipines. Making forged money is only one of his jobs. Can your side help us along? Of course. We're going to have fake deal with him in a few days. Let's check. Boss, it's okay. - Give him the stuff. - Yes. CIA, you're under arrest. Shit, it's the CIA! Stop, please! Is Wong Shana your boss? I don't know him. So you don't want to talk. Okay, move! I'll show you something. Do you see that? I really don't know him. Okay, let's see! No... no... I really don't know him. Do you know him?! I really... okay. I'll tell you. You bastard! - You're really smart. - Thank you! Hey, Gordon! Something wrong ? Heart Attack. Can you wait? I'll be your wife next week. I listen to you. Boss! Where's my daughter? She's in the living room with Peter. Shit, dad's back. Quick! Dad! Susanna 2 Time has changed. When I married your mother... We slept together three days after the wedding. Why mom is so closed-minded? No, it was my fault, I was drunk three days. Dad, stop fooling around. Peter, you must treat my daughter well. I only have one daughter. I dare not treat her bad. You dare! No, I don't! Okay, I won't bother you. You must prepare the wedding. I got it, dad! Bye! Bye, dad! - You really got a sharp tongue. - Don't you like it? What's the matter with you? Why don't you tell me that the CIA goes undercover ? Don't you know I fought hard for this place. Bill, I've told you. It's you acting recklessly you have to check everybody out. Shut up. I don't take the blame, my uncle trusts you... And you can always do what you want. Stop the bullshit. If you weren't the nephew of my stepfather he won't trust you. Go to hell! - What? - What are you doing? Uncle! Dad! What's going on? You're on the same side. Come here! Wing! If I wouldn't trust you... I won't let you run the nightclubs... And the casinos. I let Bill handle the forged dollars because... I must concentrate on the drug market. I can't do everything myself, right? So you should help Bill. Am I right? Yes, but... Stop it. Bill, you must be hold responsible for the CIA attack. I'm sure that it must be someone in the same business... Jealous of us monopolizing the market. Right. Many people look at me with jealous eyes... Uncle, don't worry. If I figure the bastard out... I will finish him off. Forget it, I don't want any trouble. Remember, you're my nephew and... You're my adopted son. You should join forces... To run my business, get that? - Yes, uncle! - Yes, dad! Wing! Dad! Deliver all these invitations. Yes. Boss, this woman really shoots well. - Lend it to me! - Okay! Mr. Peter Blanca. Are you going to take Susanna Wong as your wife... And promise to love her, no matter what circumstances? I do. Miss Susanna Wong. Are you going to take Peter Blanca as your husband... And promise to love him, no matter what circumstances? I do! In the name of God... Bless this marriage with... Eternal fortune. In the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit, amen! This is Gordon's present. He wasn't able to come here today 2 - Bitch, what are you talking about? - I am saying this is fake. I'm a CIA agent... I don't give a shit about the CIA. Don't you know who I am, in the Philippines? Lad?" Thank you for visiting my daughter's wedding. But if you got any problem... I'll solve it at the American Embassy tomorrow, not now. Bring the car. Uncle, are you alright? Quick! - To the hospital, quick! - Yes! Who is it? Drive off! Follow me, quick! Move in, quick! The killer is really smart. The job is done well. Take the money. Don't bother, they're real. There's a Chinese saying "Take a clear look even if it's picked up." I only do it accordingly. Come on, have a toast for our cooperation. Though you've finished my uncle... Remember, don't let the killer leak out anything. You've already taken your uncle's seat. You don't have to worry. I'll take your money and fix everything up. Don't worry. Dead men tell no tales. That's true. I want it fixed quickly. No problem. You can count on me. Good...Cheers! Cheers! My hand is getting worse. So you shouldn't drink so much. Too much booze makes your hand even worse. If it wasn't because of this... I wouldn't have lost my job and let you do it. New assignment again? I know this time it's too soon. We have no choice, but to do it now I think you got used to it. Tell me... Why was there another hitman on the last Job ? - So, don't you trust me? - I don't know either. Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. Most important is that you did it! This is your reward and your next target. The girl working with us last time is really good. She is as good as me. And the next target is her. Excuse me, are you Betty Lee? I am. What's the matter? Why did you kill Gordon? He was my brother. He died of heart attack! Didn't nobody tell you that? Why can't I contact you ? Are you with me now? I want to leave the organization and live our own lives. Stop kidding. As killers, we can't have any bright future. I'm not taking the job this time. What? But how can I tell to Mr. Tanaka? There's no difference between... Killing an ordinary man or a killer. Please sit! Betty, there's the information you wanted. These two killers come from other countries. According to the information, they are well-trained... They never miss a target. The one who has hired them can't be a nobody too. This is not your case. There's no difference between a killer and a CIA agent. They both do as told. Your Job is to wipe out the counterfeit Gang. Wong is dead. Who'll take his place? With no doubt... It is the person who ordered to kill Wong. Search! Shit: In the name of the father... The son and the holy spirit... Please have mercy on the soul of this man... And forgive his sins. Amen. Wing, you'll run the karaoke and the nightclubs. I'll take the casinos. I'm sure the uncle told you this before he died. Once dad is dead, you'll take all he owns. Calm. You will have what you want. Stop complaining! Who do you think you are? Besides, the uncle is dead... which is not so bad for you. " YOUÂ». - What? You know I'm telling the truth. Though I don't treat you nice, what you get isn't bad for you. Am I not right? Listen to me! I've been through the worst with dad... I can have anything I want. Anything. But if I were like you, taking everything... I would be a bastard to my father. I don't want anything you touch with your filthy hands. Stop dreaming of that. It seems like you will follow my uncle... to the grave. Have you heard, Tom? What beautiful music. I really liked the Christmas present... Thanks. I loved the picture too. I know that France is a romantic place, I can see it in your face. Calm and thoughtful... So different from Vietnam. A long time ago. Sister! I'm really scared! Okay, it's alright! - Sister! - Don't be scared! Don't forget, you're now in France through many difficulties. I want you to be good too... Don't let people look down on us. You need to look with pride to your own future... We don't have homeland to return to... So finish your studies and don't worry about the money. Say hello to your girlfriend. I don't even know if I'll come to France for Christmas. I'll write you soon. You will not shoot in here... Why not? I am a killer. Killing without a reward. What kind of killer are you? It's none of your business! Just push me, and you will find out Let's make a deal... I am with the CIA. My case involves the organization... of Charles Wong. How can I explain to my boss? I don't care who are you. All I know is that I wasn't hired to kill you. Think you can kill me? Wait and see! - Happy new year! - Happy new year! You're here to kill me, but why did you save me? It's because I want to kill you myself. Really? Don't you know you're bleeding now? Yes, but aren't you afraid I'll kill you first? Stop kidding me... Good night! I'll call you. Bye. What's going on there? I'm afraid! I didn't see anything. Bye. Thank you! What's your name? You can call me Silvia. What happened between you and her? It's alright. - Ready. It's done. - Thank you. One down, now just one more. Betty, now you know how they are. They're very good. I was almost dead. Betty, do you have any idea... About what's happening here? It should be a match between killers. They want to kill the witnesses. You think that after killing Wong... They want to eliminate... Any witnesses of the murder? Yes, as they aren't from the Philippines... There must be some connection with Albert Wong. Really? The two are still alive... And will go after Albert. Choi, the market price has changed. The rate is now five fake for one real Dollar. Our gain is only doubled. It is no big deal. My counterfeit work is the best. We don't have competitors in the Philippines. Albert! What's your problem, Wing? I keep messing around in the nightclub every night. Not like the way you operate. The Americans say that you... Are behind the changed market price. I am responsible for counterfeit... The uncle made this clear... I thought it was clear to you too. This has nothing to do with your uncle. Why not! Why don't you tell me that... You've tried to figure out the killers of my uncle. But I am the boss here! You're nothing to me. I won't rest until I know... Who killed my father! Eddie, call Tommy... Tell him to return! My grandfather gave me this house. I will stay here no matter what happens. What do you do for living? I sell my 190(1)'! You sell your body? Yes, I am a prostitute. You mean you would rather sell your body than your house? I don't understand. I don't have a choice, my body is all I have. So it's hard for you. Making a living this way. Actually we are kind of the same. We both take orders from others. Don't say that... I'm not as bad as you, guys. I'm just a prostitute. Unless they got AIDS, I'm much safer than you. The telephone! Business's calling me. Do you have a plan? What do you mean, a plan? I'm alive. How will you explain that? I'm not worried about that. Are you? I take things as they come. A killer only thinks about finishing the job. Nothing else. Amy. How long have you been in this business? Three years. Have you thought of living as a normal person, like Silvia? Women like us were not born to have a normal life. I was. Just a little confidence, that's all it takes. It's not good to to be too confident. I could kill you. You're right. Touche! For everything there are exceptions. It's true. I can kill today... And be killed tomorrow. It's something you have to live with. How long have you been a killer? As long as you've been. I see you like beer. My boyfriend taught me to drink beer in Vietnam. And where's your boyfriend? He died in the war. I watched him die. Forgive me. I shouldn't have asked. Forget it. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes. We work together, his name is Kent. And he gave me the order to kill you. At least you guys have the same life. We don't. We just share the same unpleasant stories. How does he treat you? I don't know. I suppose he treats me right. I know what you mean. It's because when we're doing job, we must be ruthless. There's no place for love! What will Kent do, now? I don't know. I'm not sure. Will he betray you? I hope he won't! Me too. Forget the future. Let's take a few shots. Okay! Hello? How is it? Do you need something else? Okay. When do you need it finished ? It's a small job. You can do it anytime. What about my payment? Don't worry. I've transferred money to your Paris bank account. So I want it quick. I can't wait anymore. You will hear from me soon. Uncle! I'm sorry about Shaun's death. Bill Wong is now in charge of the fake money dealings. I don't like him. I'd rather negotiate with you. Mr. Brown, the rules of our organization... Don't allow interferences. There's nothing I can do. I got it. But he's too aggressive, I would rather deal with you. I have to go by the rules. According to the rules, we can do other business. That's right... After all, we are friends! Forgive me, Mr. Tanaka. Kent, I am disappointed with you. You made us lose face. I'm very sorry. Miyamoto wants Yun Ling dead. It's what the client wants. Ling also wants Miyamoto dead. That's what the client wants too. I know. You're really a son of a bitch! You're not a boy scout. I order you to have Miyamoto dead. Can you do it? It should be no problem, right? She's your girlfriend. Yes, Mr. Tanaka! You want me to say how it should be done? No sir, I know how to do it. I want somebody from here to do it. No foreigner. And don't screw it up again. Yes, Mr. Tanaka. What the hell do you guys want? Where are they? Who? Fucking slut! Tell me where are they! Be good. Fuck you! Okay! It doesn't have the bullets. Don't you remember where they are? You bastard! Silvia! Silvia! Are you alright? I'm afraid. I feel so cold. Hold me, Eileen... I'm holding you, don't worry. Don't think I'm a lesbian! Stop talking nonsense, Silvia. I don't want to give up the house. Why...? Why...? - Hello? - Alan? Yes, Mr. Tanaka. What can I do for you? Eileen's still alive. Do you know that? I know. It's my fault. I haven't yet contacted her! I do not care. What's up with you? You should know the rules. Yes, I know. Bye! Come in! Sir, I came to make the bed. It's already done. Sir, here's your order. Aha great - Just leave it there - Okay! What will you do if Alan betrays you? I don't know. I hope he won't betray me. Mr. Tanaka, Alan is no longer a problem. Kent! Come back here! Are you running away from me? Don't move! Actually you've known that... You are here because you know I didn't kill Eileen, are you? You're right! You...! We're murderers. We can't avoid it. You can't blame me for it. But I do really love you, how can you be so ruthless? I tell you every time I see you. I never think of the future. There is no place for love in the heart of a killer. The boat is leaving! Take care. When you come to France study hard. You'll be a great man when you're back. Sister, I won't disappoint you. I promise I'll come back soon. Eileen, do you think I was stupid? You knew Kent would shoot, right? Yes, forgive me. Don't apologize. Tom? Forgive me, sister. But why? Why you? Better not ask what we're doing here. How come you're in the business? For your same reason. Not every refugee can study. How long have you been a killer? Two years. Two years?! You've been cheating to me for so long? Yes. But I never thought you were a killer. You came here to kill me. I'm here to kill two people. Besides her, the other is you. What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? Aren't you going to kill me? I can't because you're my sister! No, I am not your sister. My brother is in France. He's studying in France. I don't have a brother like you. Sister, I really wanted to study... But do you know how those French people treated me? I was totally worthless to them. When I was in school... I was tortured. They burned me with cigarettes. Take a look! And they hit me with bats from behind. You know how painful that is? Watch out! They're really good! Your stuff too! But the price you set is too high. There's a big market for my stuff. I don't feel sorry if you don't want to buy. Come on. I don't want to change my rules, it is my principle. Then everything will be fine! Okay, it's fixed. The so-called principle. It is not playing by the rules. Then what about your principle. You set the price whatever you want. You only end up in nothing. Stop it, I surrender! Bill, Bill. I do whatever you want. Let me go and my stuff will be yours. Don't worry, you'll die with no pain. No... no... Spread out! Bill Wong! Nam!
