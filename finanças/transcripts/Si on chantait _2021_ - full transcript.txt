Come ahead, your voice will carry better. I don't like it, it's "I'm pissed off". But no ! Come show off in front of me. [The crowd] Solange! Ah, Solange! [They chant.] Solange! Solange! Solange!

There is the date, the place. So ? The colors are gross. It's not tip-top anyway. There is more yellow in the printer. The cartridges are on the 1st, I don't know where it is. Should have asked Jean-Claude. No but, stop with that! I am a technical manager! I have nothing to do with management. It has to come in, that! I'm not distributing that, it sucks. It's ugly. So, I can't sing, can't fly, I can't do anything! It's not that you can't sing, José... [Homme] Christian ! We will be able to buy the factory, because your son is preparing the concert of the century. [Laughs] Everyone struggles in their own way, Dad. Already starting to struggle. [Laughs] [Man] No, but look... If the factory closes, you can beg with your songs! Wait! She's right, Sophie, it feels so good. - Hey, hey! - Okay okay ! Leave him alone, he can walk! Its good ! You are really childish, it's distressing. [Man] It's good! We don't want to see you again. I have no intention of returning. - Bunch of idiots! - [Worker] That's it! Clear ! -Frank! - Frank, come back. Fuck them. It's too stupid, we're ready. I don't care about the choir! If it closes, I'll be happy to see their faces! We do this for us, not for them. You are hurting yourself. I didn't know him that way. To know him, you would have had to grow up like us, like a pro. Hey, ho, be careful, Jose... I'm not part of the management! Technical framework, it has nothing to do! OK, Jean-Claude. See you. That's crazy.

Not, but wait! [Calm music] Oh damn, no! No no no ! Damn! Excuse me, but I don't really understand. It's simple, you are 2 candidates, and we only have one position. The one who best presents his competitor will win. But, I... am supposed to sell myself, not sell sir. [The man] A good salesperson sells everything. Even what he doesn't want. Be convincing. Who starts ? I will. Jean-Claude, here present, is a mature man and experienced. Given his age, he inspires confidence and knows how to listen to his customers, particularly fathers, with high purchasing potential. It would be a mistake not to choose Luc for this position. Even though he is young, and therefore by definition, less experienced than me, his youth is a major asset. It is synonymous with energy, what is essential for this position, and as a young adult, he will be in tune with this generation which constitutes the majority of our clientele, while knowing the needs of a father since he himself is... a son! [Intriguing Music] Mr. Guedon... Your pitch was outstanding. Thanks. Oh no, we didn't understand each other. You're right: Mr. Terrier is the best for the job. [The man] The young clientele, it was well seen. You prevent us from missing the rare pearl. Thank you. Really. No problem. [Calm music] Guedon! What was it this time? Did you have a swimming pool? Did you switch to summer time before everyone else? Go to work. - Hi, Jean-Claude. - Hi. When it quivers like that, you put the honey. It just needs to melt. Don't let it cook. Quiet, see? Look at this. - Your mother is not tired of you squatting? - You laugh ? She has a cook, a cleaning man and a repairman. And that ? Me ! She puts her feet under the table and let's be done with it. - [Door] - It changes her from my father. [Mother] It's me! Hello Frank. It smells good ! What's this ? It's a chicken with prunes with small almonds, honey. It simmers. I'll call you when it's ready. You stay, Frank? No, I can't, that's nice. I eat with my father, it's Wednesday. Ah. [Calm music] How's your new TV? I don't look at her seeing the bullshit going on. It's funny, putting away mom's records, I found a photo of you in a Sardou album. You had seen him in Anzin, hadn't you? Can't you throw away those records? And you, can't you make an effort? A question, an answer makes a conversation. Like normal people. And incidentally, it allows to talk about mom. But even that, it sounds like you want more. Saying nothing, it avoids saying bullshit. Why am I coming to see you? Don't come anymore. You're right. Delete me from your contacts, it will make room! [He slams the door.] ["Can the can" - Suzy Cuatro à la radio] She's pissing off your roommate. She's my owner. Still sucks.

You know, what is a car? It helps you get from point A to point B, that's all. Go on ! En route, les winners. [Calm music] Hello. We come to see Mr. Turpin. Who do I advertise ? Mr. Chesnot, Mr. Guédon from the company "Si on chantait". - Good. - Thank you. - [Indistinct talk] - [Soft music] Sorry, I have almost nothing. - We put what we can. - No it's OK. Vinyls sell pretty well. It's normal, a car pays more. It is... And José, isn't he here? Anyway, I don't have time. I have lots of stuff to do. I have delivery notices, I have to go to the post office. Ah. Geraniums are all... [He hesitates.] I have to... I have lots of stuff to do. Anyway, I don't sing that well, it doesn't matter. You finished ? You know what's missing from this box? It's not the money. It is enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is not mine. Me, I doubt and I piss you off. Sophie is a pain in the ass, and Jean-Claude holds the reins well, but it's not him who has the potato. It's you ! Only you can galvanize us because you are like that. You run on enthusiasm. [Soft music] You are the soul of the group. And we need you, damn it. Really ? Don't force me to repeat it. Come on, come on. I don't even have geraniums. - [Light hubbub] - [Knock.] Hello. I have a delivery for Marc. It's me. - Oh! Hello. - Hello. So... It's a message from Melanie. "Marc, I find out that it's been 4 months "that you're cheating on me with the switchboard operator in your box "and brag about it to all your friends, "So I'm breaking up. "Goodbye looser." - What is this bullshit ? - There's a song. Eh ?

It's not his favorite, but hey. - Did you buy them at "4 pavés"? - Yeah. I wanted to tell you... I set up a box with old ones From the factory. Custom songs. Are you going to make a living with this? For the moment, it starts, but we hope. It's more fun than delivering meals. People, they want to eat. You sell them air. Do you have a more stupid idea? I try to get out of it. There were other ways. You are never happy! Always something to say! Mom would have encouraged me. What do you know about it? She is no longer there. He also sometimes said bullshit.

[Frank] We will reach 25,000 people. It will be full. Let's go. [Laughs] I'm going to tread the lawn of Hainaut. [Henriette] I put a bottle in the fridge for when the box takes off, here we are! Yeah. After that, no more checks for 140 euros. Sorry, I don't have time. A delivery to be made. What? - This machine has been working for 12 years. - Yes. There is a red button!

He takes you for a bitch. Come on, come on. [Sobs] It saddens me to see you so unhappy. A guy like that doesn't deserve you. You are a great girl. You might find someone who really loves you. Lots of guys are worth it. But you don't see them. [Incomprehensible remarks] - Eh ? - I know, but I love him. You do not understand. [Portable] - You don't pick up. - Yes. Okay, you pick up, but you tell him to fuck off. He must respect you. - Yes. - It's understood ? You don't let yourself go. Yes! It's me speaking. I'm tired of being thought of as a bitch on duty! I don't calm down. Do you realize the humiliation? Are you front? [Soft music] I don't know, are you coming? - I go. - No Please. [She runs.] [Philippe] How could I imagine that Sandrine would do such a thing to me? Eh ? - I had to pretend. - Nope. I couldn't do otherwise. Well... I didn't come empty-handed. - It's not enough. - I have other things for you. [Soft music] I'll take you. I will take care of you. It suits you well, your little shorts. Oh ! Well, there you go ! Ah, mam! How was it this morning? It was, it was. Very well. [She sighs.] Uh... Darling. Honey, come here, I have something to tell you. What is happening ? You're ill ? No why do you say that ? I don't know, you look like... when you're sick. Oh but no, no. I met someone. A man. I have a lover. [embarrassed laugh] Wait, I'm not done. I haven't known that since your father. Yes. Tonight he is coming home. I would like to be alone with him. Alright, yeah. Bah... I'll go up there, don't worry, I'll leave you alone. José... I would like to be "alone" with him. You go sleep somewhere else. Because... She coughs. [She mumbles.] Here it is. What ? No, okay, I got it. - Yes... - Yes! I had already understood. HM okay. Well, well I... I finish the... At least it's clean. Alright, that's nice. Go on. Come on, boom. Oh ! It's for me ? Of course, my pussycat. I was uncomfortable yesterday. I was bad for you. Oh ! - She is magnificent. - [He nods.] I am happy. It's good that you wear it. Why do you say "it's good that I have the door"? Well because... You, at least... I mean, she's really good. You will be sublime in it. She's not your wife's? Wait. She doesn't like him. She didn't wear it once. It's stupid, isn't it? It's like I bought it for you. Hey, my pussycat? You offer me what your wife wants more? Do you think you are at Emmaus? No... Take your shit back! I don't want to see your face anymore, get the fuck out! I never want to see you again. Get out, get the hell out of here. I don't want to see you anymore. - Don't push me either! - Go back to your wife! I don't want to see you anymore. [Tears] It was not the same cries as usual. You were brave, my dear. [Sobs] Oh, my little cat. Go ahead, cry. José, she is 58 years old! You are not his father. Neither her husband. Let her live. She has the right. It's a woman. No, it's mom. Move on. Even for you, I swear, it's better. I don't know who he is. You suck. [Doorbell] - Am I bothering you ? - No. What are you doing here? He got dumped by his mother. Frank, drink with me, please. I started alone, but alone, it's pathetic. You have always been my friend. Please. [She sighs.] [Jose] Yeah! Yeah, she's right. We're going to do that! We get drunk all 3. Great idea! [Sophie] Can I sleep here tonight? What? - Yes yes. - OKAY. [Whisper] Get out. What? - Oh ! - I am tired. No... no ? OK. I prefer to sleep there because... Just a little. [Very loud] I'm going to bed because... Oh ! I am exhausted. Big day. Have fun. Do you want to sit down? All the times he left right after fucking me because he had "an important meeting". You speak ! There are even birthdays. Every year, I found myself like a bitch because he couldn't free himself. [Sigh] You were right: never gave a fuck about me. [The acquiesces.] Why didn't I listen to you? [The acquiesces.] He never loved me. You are nice. Your girl will be lucky. Uh... What are you doing ? [Soft music] Bah... I kiss you. But why ? Non ? Aren't you in love with me? We're friends so we can't be in love. Well, you see, you're like my brother. I can't be in love with my brother, it's weird. [She laughs.] Damn... Oh, that's so funny. We're tired, that's all. [Laughs] No but Frank... Are you serious ? Are you in love with me? Alright, come on, I'll take you back. [Soft music] I'm sorry. Good night. [Scooter] It's better ? Hm... Here, I brought you this. Drink it, you'll feel better. - Hmm. - There's an order for you.

You never come back here again. Either way, you don't care of this company. Why are they bickering? - Philippe will comfort you. - [Sob] Bah ? What is happening ? Why is she crying ? Nothing. She will no longer work with us. What ? What do you mean ? She's not motivated enough. We'll find someone else. She told you that? Is it because of the delivery I made? It's my fault, Frank! I wanted to see how does it feel to deliver. And people were awfully happy. Henriette, this does not concern you. - Bah. - I do not understand everything. - Me niether. - There is nothing to understand. She never gave a fuck about the company. She leaves. - Oh? - Did you fire her? No, I made a decision. Go to work, there are deliveries. - If anyone has to go, it's me. - Henriette, go back to your standard. I disagree. We all decide together. You suck. Sorry ? Who do you think You Are ? For the one who was the only one to believe this idea. - What ? No I think not. - Where were you at the start? At home, with your risk-free shitty job . In fact, you started this company to become a motherfucker boss like the one who fired us. You got the idea but without the group, your idea, it's worth nothing! I leave with the idea that is worth nothing. - Screw you. - But Frank! Frank, stop your bullshit! Don't mess it up, it's starting to work. We play at the stadium! Shut up ! Pardon me? He has gone mad. Me, I continue. We'll find another singer and call Sophie back. I can't go on without him. Emancipate yourself! Are you going to be his dog all your life? - Oh no ! - What about ? He just walked off, and you already want to take his place? You wanted this from the start! Take his place and play the little boss! That's enough now. You're a real asshole, actually. Yeah ! That's good, that makes two, and besides, you too have not changed: that shabby little executive that you were and always will be. OK, kiss ! I can not believe. You're screwing it all up. [melancholic music] [Messaging] Hello, this is Frank. Please leave me a message. [melancholic music] [Joseph] M. Chesnot ! Have you seen Frank? We have to sing tonight at the stadium, and he's not answering. No, not seen. Thanks. [Mobile on vibrate] [melancholic music] [Phone] "Let's sing", hello. Oh no, sorry, sir. The company is currently closed. Yes I... I don't know when it will reopen, no. Call back later, huh? Thank you. Goodbye. See you soon. [He coughs.] You know what ? If you tell me that my CV is perfect, but that unfortunately, I have too much of experience, which would harm the company, I give you a slap. With the flat of the hand. I... Screw you.
