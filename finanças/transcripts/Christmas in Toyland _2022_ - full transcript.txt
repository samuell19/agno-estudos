So what are we thinking? Are we moving offices? Are they getting rid of the vending machines? Okay Steph, I don't think either of those are worthy of an emergency meeting. Speak for yourself. I just wish they'd laid it out in an email, instead of springing it on us like this. About a month ago, Gertrude asked me to pull all the sales reports for the past three years. That's not that unusual, is it? No, it's not that unusual, but the numbers were so bad. Well, how bad are we talking, like potential layoffs? Maybe. I mean, she didn't say. Now I'm starting to worry. Good morning. Merry Christmas. Okay, let's try not to panic. Maybe they're going to give us Christmas bonuses. With revenue down 18%? Good point. Maybe David is going to grace us with an early retirement. Steph, he's not that bad. Are you kidding? He hovers over that merchandise department like the Grinch trying to steal Christmas. What's that now? David. Hi. Didn't see you there. I was just headed to the meeting and I heard my name. Speaking of the meeting, do you know what it's about? No, but I got a hunch. Is that the board? That's the board. Ah, there you are. Thank you for coming in. So everyone, you'll remember our head of strategy and marketing, David, our merchandising manager, Stephanie, and our lead data analyst, Charlie. Have a seat. Okay everyone, let's get to work. I know it's unusual for us to be springing a board meeting on you like this, but we are in unprecedented times. I thought we would start by reviewing those sales reports that you worked up for me, Charlie. Yes, absolutely, I have them. So on screen you can see a summary of our sales reports for the last 12 quarters. Unfortunately, we notice a fairly steady decline in revenues in most of our locations. However, we haven't gotten the results from our place structure strategy yet, so bear that in mind. Respectfully, those numbers don't even look close to stabilizing. That's true. However, we haven't seen the impact of holiday sales either. We just need more time. Do we have time? That's the real question. Personally, I think that this is the moment to consider moving exclusively online. I've taken the liberty of putting together a transition plan that would have all of our brick and mortar stores off of the payroll by spring. What? Is that something the board is actually considering? Everything's on the table right now. Do you have the data for our online sales? Yes I do, and they are trending upward, but I don't think closing our stores is a good idea. People don't know what they want until they have it in their hands. Actually, we have an algorithm for that. Algorithms need data to push trends. Our stores set them. I mean, that's our brand. If we close our stores, we're a wholesaler. Is that what the company wants? Are you suggesting we ignore the fact that all our stores are hemorrhaging money? Well, not all, actually. This is store 24 in Jersey City. It's the only one on our roster that is showing a steady increase in revenue. I know this store, it's an outlier. Or maybe we can learn something from them. I know exactly what we can learn from them. David, let's hear her out. Go on, Charlie. Thank you. I'm just saying it's clear that this store is doing something different. They've exceeded our projections for the area the last three years in a row. We could go there, investigate their strategy, apply it to the rest of our stores. Big Teddy Toy Company employs thousands of people across North America, most of whom work in retail. And I think we owe it to them to pursue every avenue before making such a big decision, especially this time of year. It's Christmas. It's decided then. Charlie, you go to store 24, report back what they're doing differently. Me? Oh, I just analyze data. Right. But if you can correlate the sales to actual, tangible, in-store efforts, then we have something to go on. If not, then perhaps David is right, and this store is just an anomaly. I guess I will head there first thing in the morning then. Perfect. See if you can wrap this up by Christmas Eve. Oh, absolutely. Good meeting everyone. Good luck in Jersey City. Thank you. Don't be surprised if it doesn't work out. We all know moving online is inevitable. We'll just have to agree to disagree, won't we David? Yeah, and hope we all have jobs by the time you're done. Merry Christmas, Charlie. Merry Christmas. What just happened? You knocked it out of the park is what? No, I have to tell Gertrude I can't do it. I'm supposed to visit my mom in Seattle for Christmas this year. So, you get your research done before Christmas Eve. No problem. What research, Steph? I don't even know what I'm looking for. Yet, you'll figure it out, you always do. But what if I don't? And that's so many closed stores. So many people out of jobs. Just focus on the little details. It's what you're good at, and it's what makes you so smart. It's what makes you a good toy designer, too. What? No, that's, it's just a hobby. For now. Forever. Look, once you figure out what's up with this store, you'll be well positioned to pitch your toy line to Gertrude. Steph, I love you, but when I say I have bigger fish to fry, I mean giant Goliath-sized fish. I'm just saying. Please let it go. Fine. You win, this time. I am going to start by emailing the store's manager. Good luck. Thanks. Hello, this is Charlie Sawyer from corporate. I'm outside the store and it seems to be locked. So as soon as you get this, please call me back. Hope everything's all right, bye. Hi there. Can I help you? Yes, I have a meeting. Oh, you must be one of our seasonals. I mean you're a little early, but please come on in. Marta can help you at the front desk. I'm actually- If you have any idea how to put up window displays, she'll probably have you help with one of those. No, this place, oh no, no, no. No, well listen, we got plenty of good people inside. Okay, they can help you out. After you. I, uh, thank you. All right, so, over here we have the coats. Coffee's over there, and right next to it is the front desk. Morning, Ray. Morning. Marta, my assistant manager. She has this place running like a well-oiled machine. Don't you, Marta? Now, we're a team. You must be one of the seasonals. Yeah, and she's early. Like you already. Could you please put that on the shelf right there. Thank you. - Sure. - Message for you, boss. Boss? Someone from corporate. I don't wanna hear this. Oh, what now? Are they mad that I swapped out that game we used to play? It blew over in the wind every time the door opens. So if you'll excuse me, I just gotta listen to this. Oh, you don't have to listen to that. Oh yes I do. If corporate calls and I don't respond, they'll probably send somebody down here. Play it. Hello, this is Charlie Sawyer from corporate. I'm outside the store and it seems to be locked. So as soon as you get this, please call me back. Hope everything's all right, bye. Was that you on the? Yes. I'm not a seasonal employee. I'm from the planning and analysis department, and corporate did send me here. We had a scheduled meeting at 9:00 a.m. I wasn't aware of any meeting. Did I have a meeting? Nope. I emailed you about it yesterday afternoon. I don't check my messages after hours. So what exactly is this about? Well, I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but your store is our company's best performing location. And corporate is very interested to know what you do different, and if your strategy can be replicated, we are gonna apply it company wide. And how are you planning on doing that? I would like to stay and observe for about a week or so. It's Christmas, this is the busiest time of the year. Look, no offense, but we don't really have time to babysit anyone. You will not have to babysit me. I promise I will be out of your hair. Fly on the wall, you won't even notice me. Right. No, I - Starting. Wow, look, you seem like a really nice person. Okay, but I don't feel that this meeting is necessary, so I'm just gonna get back to it. Okay yeah. It's just, it's not really up to you, or me. These orders are from the CEO herself. So I'd like to start by looking at the numbers. Do you have an office? Yeah. Right this way. Around the boxes. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Nice to meet you. So, this is it. You know, it's not a high rise with the view of the park, but. It's fine. It's great. Thank you. If you need anything, I'll be at the front. Sorry, where's the computer. What computer? With the sales reports? Oh yeah, sales reports. Yeah. There ya are, I file by hand and then Marta takes it home quarterly, and logs it to corporate. Why would you log it by hand? Because computers crash and paper's reliable. Yeah, okay, of course. Oh, here you go. That should set you up. All right. Okay. You got this, Charlie. Oh, there's more. Just keeps on going. Good morning team. It's gonna be another big one today, so I say we keep the line up short and the aisle's clean. Other than that, have a great day. Hi Uncle G. Hey, good morning Em. Down low. How you doing? Oh, good. I remembered to pack my homework this morning. So my day is already looking up. Well, that's great. Thanks for taking her. My vendor from Newark canceled her delivery on me last minute, so I've gotta go pick it up. You sure you don't mind driving her to school? Not at all. Finish a few things around the store and then I'll take you. I'd call you a saint, but that would mean admitting I'm the inferior sibling, so I won't. I love you. Love you, Mom. Be good, okay? Drive safe. So you know that Santa house I'm building? I do. I'm trying to decide how many rooms should go in it. That's a very important question. What'd you decide? Well, I asked my teacher if Santa had any siblings, 'cause they don't need their own rooms, right? You know what, I never thought of that, but that's a great question. So what did she say? It's not in the literature. Oh, it's not in the literature. All right, what's up with her? Don't you worry about it, okay? How about you go get some hot chocolate? Really? Yeah, really. But listen, only get like three marshmallows this time, okay? Save some for the rest of us. Can't make any promises. It's Marta, right? That's me. I'm really sorry about earlier. Don't even mention it. Are you finding everything you need back there? I know Grant's a little old school in the recordkeeping department. Yeah, no kidding. Actually, he mentioned that you might have some digital copies at home. Oh yeah, I do. I can send 'em over tonight if you want. That would be wonderful. Thank you so much. You're welcome. And Charlie, try not to let Grant get to you. He can be stubborn as an ox, that one, but he comes by it honestly. He grew up helping his grandfather run a store, so he's got his own way of doing things. And you didn't hear it from me, but if you're looking for a way to get on his good side, he loves the candy cane bark from the Pale Blue Dot down the street. Oh great. Do they sell it by the truckload? He'll come around, don't worry. He always does. Thank you for the tip. Anytime. You're still here. Yeah. Can't close up till you go home, and didn't want anybody else to stay late, so. Right. Sorry about that. What are you doing? Just readjusting these displays. You're gonna rat me out, are you? You know, contrary to popular belief, just because I work at corporate doesn't mean I have all the display manuals memorized. Sure you don't. Thank you. Although, that's a lot lower than this picture. Please, join me. Okay. Now, all these displays are focused on getting the wrong person's attention. That's smart. I wonder if I could use that data and correlate it with increased sales. Look, I don't need the data to know that it works. And quite frankly, it's not about the business, it's about the kids. Of course. But if I can't prove it with numbers. Numbers, yeah. Fine. Look, I know we got off on the wrong foot, and it may not seem so, but I'm here to help. Well, I mean, according to you, we don't really need any help and, it's getting late, so, you're probably tired. Goodbye. Goodnight. Morning. Good morning. Can I help you find something? Yes, actually I am looking for your infamous candy cane bark. Ah, yes. How much do you need? As much as you'll sell me. Well, I usually reserve some for my brother Grant, but the rest is yours. Your brother, Grant? Oh yeah, he's addicted. Every year, when the holiday treats roll around, he's over here buying in bulk. It's amazing he still has any teeth left in his head. Grant Leviston? Yeah, you know him? Sort of. I work at Big Teddy Toy Company and head office sent me here to, well, it's a long story actually. So I won't bore you with that. Okay. Mom look, I just finished the roof. That's amazing, honey. This is my daughter, Emma. And this is? Charlie. Nice to meet you. Hi Charlie. Charlie works with Uncle Grant. I'll be a minute. Thank you so much. So you work with my Uncle G? Kind of, sort of. You're lucky, he's the best. He always lets me play and makes everything a game. He even taught me how to build this stuff without the instructions. He did, did he? I'm noticing a trend. What are you building? It's Santa's house. This is where Rudolph's gonna live. This will be Santa's room. And this will be Sally Clause's room. Sally Claus? Who's Sally Claus? That's Santa's sister. Well, at least in my head. Right. They like to argue sometimes, but they mostly get along, and they laugh all the time. You know, that's one of the most creative ideas I've ever heard. Really? 'Cause I can't find any toys like that, but I know I will. Besides, I still have some magic elf dust at home. Magic elf dust? What's magic elf dust? My Uncle G gave it to me. It's kinda like Pixie dust, but it's from elves and it grants wishes. Oh, I know what you're thinking. I seem too mature to believe in that stuff, but every wish I've made has come true. Really? Every wish? Definitely, not just for me. My mom uses it too. Like when I was a baby, my mom wished to adopt me. Of all the little babies she could pick, she wanted me, and then that Christmas we became each other's family. Pretty cool, right? Yeah, very cool. And you're still the best Christmas present ever. Thank you so much. How much do I owe you? Oh, it's on the house. Grant's a tough chestnut to crack. Thank you, but here. Oh. To balance your books. Thank you. Bye Emma. Bye. Good morning. Good morning. You know the play structure is for the kids, right? Really? Does it say that somewhere in the manual? I guess we'll never know, since someone doesn't follow the manual. You do that often. Yeah, especially when I'm playing with the kids, or it needs a good dusting. Wanna have a whirl? No thank you. I was thinking we could go over these quarterly reports that Marta sent me last night. Really, still on the numbers, huh? Yeah, kind of my job. So I've noticed some significant sales spikes that I think we can cross reference with in-store activity. And from there I- You go for it Really. I can't really do it without you though. You know what? Ryan actually needs my help on the floor. So sorry. Wait. Did you talk to my sister? No. I mean, yes, because I bought this from her, but Marta said that you liked it. Unless you don't like it. No, I do. You wouldn't happen to be poking around in my personal life on behalf of corporate, would you? I had to ask. What? No, no, I'm just, I'm just trying to find some common ground between us so that we could get at the bottom of this before Christmas, so. So you wanna know how my store runs? Yes, please. Follow me. You want me to stock the shelves? Sure, later. But first, that looks like this person could really use a hand. Oh no. I have no training in customer service. I'm a data analyst. Which is why you could use this perspective. Plus, I mean, wouldn't it be a shame if we didn't get to her within the allotted two minute greeting time as per the corporate manual? Okay. All right. Okay. Hi there. Hi. Welcome to Big Teddy Toy Company. Can I help you with anything? I'm just browsing. Thanks. Oh yeah, of course. Browse away. Oh those are cute. Yes. Oh, you know this toy right here. It's our top seller. Okay. It is very popular in the seven to 10 age range, up 6% from last year, which I know doesn't sound like a lot. Okay, thank you. Actually quite an increase considering the competitive nature of the demographic. And if you need anything else just, I'll be right over there. Okay. Cool. Isn't bad, huh? That was awful. I majored in math and fine arts, okay? Do either of those things scream extrovert to you? No. Look, okay, I'll get this next one. You just observe, all right? But, little tip. Doesn't have to be so data driven, right? It's a toy store, just act like a kid. Hey, good morning. Oh, hi. It's a cold one out there, huh? Oh, it's freezing. Yeah, hey, if you guys need to warm up, I've got some hot chocolate right over there. Well thank you, that's very nice. Not a problem. Can I help you find anything today? Well, we're here to pick out a gift for her older sister. I get to give it to her myself. Wow, and how old is your older sister? She's nine. Nine, that's awesome. Hey, you know what? When I was nine, I had like a mountain of Stuffy's like this high. You think she'd like those? I don't know. No? Okay. That's all right, how about this? Excuse me, ma'am. Now, this here. It's our latest scooter. It's got lights. It's pretty fast. Think should be into that. I don't think so. Okay. My niece, she's nine. She has this exact set. She loves it. What do you think of that? Oh. Let me see here. Oh, see that sticker right there. That means Santa Claus came in here and said that was 50% off. Oh? That work? Oh yes, it does. Yes. Okay. All right, well you take that. We're gonna go over here and Ryan's gonna help you. Thanks so much. Not a problem. Boss, I don't think this one's sale. Just use my employee discount. Thanks for locking up. Goodnight. He's going to the Christmas market down on the corner. Thank you. Make that two, please. So, employee discount, huh? When the situation calls for it. You're gonna tell the big boss? No, I was actually gonna say that that was really nice of you. We didn't have a lot of money growing up, but I loved all that art stuff, and those kits would've been right up my alley. Anyway, I was thinking tomorrow we could finally tackle those spreadsheets? You know what we can do, story time. Story time? Yeah, story time. It's just this thing that we do with the kids. Look, I know it's not the policy handbook, okay? But, we have the space and the kids love it, so. Am I giving off some kind of corporate tyrant vibe? Or am I missing something? I just know how this goes. Oh really? You know how, what goes exactly? Well, they send you in here to stick your nose in our business, right? Then you gotta find a way to cut overhead costs, so you fire a bunch of people and put in self-help kiosks. How am I doing? That's not what I'm doing. - No? - No. Look, these are my employees, my friends, my family. I understand. I'm really, really trying to help you. Really? Yes, really. You wanna make us get rid of the cocoa stands? No. - You gonna stop our events? - No. You're gonna make us use accounting software. Well, maybe. Knew it. I'm trying to save your store, Grant. And every other Big Teddy Toy Company Store while I'm at it. What do you mean? Head office is threatening to shut down every brick and mortar and move everything online. No, that can't be right. It is, actually. And I only have six days to figure out a solution, or, you, me, all of your employees could be out of jobs. So please? Take my bribe, and let's start over. I'll see you in the morning. Charlie? Thanks for telling me. [C] Now, the north pole didn't seem so far away, but Santa and elves got lost, and they couldn't find their way back home. They were stuck in New York City. Look at this. Now how were the children gonna get all their Christmas presents? Instead of feeling glum, Santa and the elves decided to build a brand new workshop. Pretty awesome, right? They worked extra hard to make sure that all the little girls and all the little boys got their presents. So, everyone was filled with Christmas cheer. But what's Christmas cheer look like? Show me. That's good. Well, after Christmas day, Santa got a letter from Missus Claus with a map. What? That map showed him how to get back to the north pole. Sweet. Okay, now what was Santa gonna do now? I mean, couldn't just abandon his new workshop, right? He needed someone to step in and help. So, from that day forward, I promised Santa that I would step in and I would help him run that special shop. It's just outside the city, right here. Now, before Santa left, he gave me something very special, okay? And I want to share that with all of you. So, this, it's magic elf dust. Okay? Now I'd like to give some elf dust to each one of you. And I have some very special instructions first, okay? So just hold your hands out, come here. Here you go. All right, now all you hold on to that. For me? Oh, thank you. Little bit here. You ready? So, we have a little bit here. We're gonna close our eyes, I'm gonna count to three, then you're gonna make a wish. Okay? Ready? Close your eyes. And three, two, one. That sounded like it worked. Well that's it. Thank you all for coming today. That's the end of story time. - Whoa! - There we go. All right, you can run back to your parents and listen, please drop your Santa letters in the big red box by the cash register before you leave, don't forget. Hi! - Hey Charlie, right? - Yes. How are you? Oh, we're good. Grant's not giving you too much trouble, is he? Well. He's all bark and no bite, trust me. I trust you. Hey, how's your Santa house coming? Did you find Sally Claus yet? Not yet, but I keep wishing. Well we'll find one soon, honey. Anyway, we gotta get going. See you around, Charlie. Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, go easy on her or you'll have to answer to me. Oh, thanks mom. Hi. Hello. So what'd you think? I think you hold a captive audience, I'll give you that. Nothing to do with the costume? Apparently it draws a crowd. Look at this place. Oh it's normal, every time we have an event. Do you have a second? Yeah. I wanna show you something. Okay. Here are your sales reports for the last two quarters. Wow. Accounting software lays out nice and clean, huh? You see these peaks? So, originally I thought they correlated with flash sales or redesigning an NCAP or something. But now I am willing to bet that all of these line up with some kind of special event you had. Yeah, I think right here we did a fall harvest thing, painted pumpkins and whatnot. Okay. This is just before Halloween. We did trick or treating play around. Whoever had a costume could participate. Do you have some kind of official calendar I can use to cross reference these numbers? Nope. Every Saturday morning, 10:00 a.m. everybody knows to show up for reading time. The rest is word of mouth. Do you think that you could fill one out for me for the year? The year? To the best of your ability, of course. I need it to run statistical analyses before I present to the board. Sounds fun, yeah. I'll see what I can do. Great, excellent. This is just what we needed. Exactly what we need. Okay, I'm just gonna zip back to the office and start on this, so by the time you send me the calendar, we will be off to the races. Oh, unless you need me to stay here. I can totally stay here. No, no, we're good. Okay. Look, to be honest, just really trying to find out why you're working so hard to help us. It's my job. And you know, I don't wanna see people lose their jobs, and families suffer just because I didn't do my best to find a solution. So just looking for a solution? Listen, when I was growing up, my mom had to work three jobs just to pay the rent. Retail during the day, waitressing at night, and housekeeping on the weekend so, my entire childhood, I was just hanging out in a toy store. It's my favorite place to be. Can't say I blame you. I guess I really don't wanna see them closed. It's not the answer I was expecting. - Nice. - Oh. I'm sorry, what were you expecting? No, just something more by the book, less by the heart. I'm sorry to disappoint you. You didn't. Are you gonna tell me what's in the elf dust? Sugar, salt, flour? Gonna have to ask Santa. I'll get right on that. It works, you know. Yeah, so I hear. You don't believe me, okay. I'll prove it to you. Pick you up first thing tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m. Okay. Pick me up at 8:00 a.m. But you have to send me that calendar tonight. Consider it done. Hey. Where are we going? Santa's workshop. No, Grant, seriously. Seriously. Who's G? What, what are you doing here? Oh, I just came to tell you the rumblings from the water cooler gang, but more importantly, what are you doing smiling like that? What? Like what? Like a normal human being? I was thinking more like it's Christmas, 1998, and you just opened up Spice World on VHS. I just got an important document from the manager of the store. I think we're really onto something. Mm-hmm, it sure looks like it. Stop, seriously. I just need to run a few more stats and then I'm ready to present to the board. About that. What? Gertrude held a closed door meeting with the board today. Uh oh. They're shutting down all the west coast stores, Charlie. What? I haven't finished my research, and Gertrude told me I had till Christmas Eve. I'm so sorry, but David's been lobbying the board ever since you left and. David? Charlie. All right, well you have a good night. David. Wait. Yes, Charlie. I heard the news. What news? That you convinced the board to close all our west coast stores. I tried to tell you moving online was inevitable. But I am on the verge of a breakthrough, really. I just, I need a few more days. If you could just please talk to- Charlie, forgive me for saying this, but have you ever considered you might be wasting everyone's time? Excuse me. What if the only thing that comes from this is our retail employees have less notice. They need to find a new job. If we tell them now they can start looking, planning for a future. Instead of living off these false hopes and empty promises. I haven't promised anything. Well, maybe that's because you know, deep down, this is a wild goose chase, too. You okay? You seem a little off. Yeah, I'm fine, yeah. Just a long night, way too much coffee. Did you get those stats off to the board? In progress, yeah. Mm. You sure you're okay? I am just curious about where we're headed. I mean, am I about to meet the big man himself? Wow. What is this place? Oh, is this your grandfather's store? How did you know that? Marta might have mentioned it. Marta? Yes, this was my grandfather's store. Man, myth, legend. But it's still here, what happened? Well, he died when I was 16, and he gave it to my dad who didn't want to run it. He was a financial planner. So he closed it, Iz and I begged him not to sell it, which he didn't, thankfully. And here it is. Doors have been closed ever since. Hmm, that's really too bad. You wanna see inside? When's the last time you were in here? It's been a while. Charlie? Back here. Ah, I see. The source of the magical mystical mysterious elf dust. What are you doing? Well, only a few more days until Christmas. We are fresh outta this stuff, so we gotta stock up. Right, gotta make those Christmas wishes come true somehow. You know it. Why does it feel like we're stealing from the fountain of youth or something? You do believe there's a little bit of magic happening here. Okay, I didn't say that. You're thinking it. No, no, I'm not. I'm actually thinking, why doesn't he just make this himself? We could easily find out what's in it. Nope, impossible. This stuff here. It's directly from the north pole. Oh, I see. Go on. You want me to taste it. Why not? No, it's for making wishes, not for tasting. I wish that you would taste it. So you believe in wishing. It could be powdered sugar, like the candy from when we were kids, with the stick, then you just dip it in the, it's like sugar on sugar. Just try it. You can't tell me that you've never thought about at least tasting it. It's 30-year-old sand from Coney Island. Aha, I knew it. Give me that, it doesn't mean it doesn't work. Yeah, for kids. And adults. - Mm-hmm - Mm-hmm. Look no harm in asking for what you want. That's a wish. Is that why you run a toy store? So you can keep being a kid? Look just because you're an adult, doesn't mean you have to abandon everything about being a kid. All right, you have everything you need? Yeah, pretty much. Wait. Oh, you gotta see this. Pretty cool, right? Yeah. my grandfather, he dressed up like Santa all the time. He loved it. And then he would have the kids, they would sit right there. I've been here before. What? I remember. I, I've sat here. You'd press a button and this would rise up to eye level. It was like seeing Santa on a roller coaster. That was your grandfather? Yeah. How old were you? I was six, maybe seven. My mom worked every Christmas, but that year she had off. I remember she took me here. Wow, it was so magical. I'd never seen anything like it. I'm pretty sure I asked him, wow, your grandfather, for this hand-carved wooden reindeer, pulling Santa in a sleigh. It was so cute. Yeah, it was my favorite toy in the store. Did you get it? Yeah, I did. And I played with it every day that year. I mean, it didn't matter if it was July. I had it out, I was obsessed. Do you still have it? No. Wow. I mean, my mom and I moved around so much, packing, unpacking. It gets to a certain point where if it's not necessary for survival, you have to leave it behind. So. It makes sense why you'd be so into structure and spreadsheets and certainty. You always want to be a data analyst? No, I mean, I was always good with numbers, but I kind of wanted to be a toy designer. Really? Yeah, I'd build things outta Popsicle sticks all the time. Once I built this three-story house, and I sold it at a garage sale in Queens for $10. I was really proud of myself. It's a great sale. Do you still design? I do, yeah. Okay, well it's settled then. You gotta show me. - What? - Yeah. - No. - Yeah. No. I run a toy store. We can put your product dead center. We can't do that. Why not? Corporate pre-sales its displays for years in advance. And besides they're just drawings. For now. Forever. Why do you say that? Because the odds of success as a toy designer are extremely low, talking like 1% low. I have a great job. Well, somebody's gotta do it. Might as well be you, right? Okay, let's go. I have to get back to the office. Do you have a minute? Charlie. I wanted to go over my research of store 24. It turns out that this manager goes above and beyond for his community. And I have the hard numbers that prove his bottom line is connected to in-store events. I really appreciate how thorough you're being. This is exactly what we need. I mean, we could save all our east coast stores. It's not too late. Maybe you should come back to the office, just for the time being. But this is our chance to preserve the in-store experience. I just feel- We're still figuring out next steps. Okay, what if we made this a standalone flagship store? Charlie, what? What did you just say? A flagship store? Interesting. You have until Friday. Thank you. Hey, how's your day? The board's decided to close most of our stores. What do you mean they're closing the stores? I'm sorry that I didn't tell you right away. When did you find out? Yesterday. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to tell you this morning, but truthfully I was trying to figure out a plan first. Well, I have to tell Marta, I mean. No, you don't have to tell Marta. Yeah, look, her son goes to college next year. She's been saving up for that, and Ryan's a fantastic employee. He's gonna need help finding a new job. These are people's lives that we're talking about here. It's not over. I have a meeting with Gertrude on Friday. I'm gonna pitch this store as one of their flagship stores. With the success of your store, they would be crazy not to agree to it. Yeah maybe. Or maybe they just shut us down by New Year's Eve, right? They're not gonna close you New Year's Eve. Can you promise that? Then your plan better work. Steph, we need to make this store not just any store. They have to know that it's essential to the success of their company. Exactly. We need to show it off. We need to make it look like a flagship store. I can even put pictures in the slideshow and they'll see with their own eyes its potential. That's a great idea. And then I'll hit them with the numbers. Then bam, they sign on the dotted line. Exactly. Hopefully. Look, I think your numbers are gonna get you really close to the finish line, but it's gonna be stories that really hit it home. Okay. I'm listening. What do you mean? Well, I think you need to bring this manager guy into it more. I mean, he's obviously a big reason why that place is so successful. I mean, he is really great. Oh yeah? Stop it, no, I mean, you know, professionally. Okay. I'm serious though. Focus on what he does differently. You're right. I have a photographer coming in first thing in the morning. I think it's pretty good. It does need something. That narrows it down. Yeah, like what? Like, you. Like how? Like you in that elf costume. No, corporate's not gonna love that idea. If it won me over, maybe it can win them over too. You never know. Did I now? Hmm? I won you over? I also think we need a Christmas tree, like right here. Picture it. - Okay. - Okay. I'll go get one outta the back. No. Grant, a real tree. Oh, but corporate manual states that we can't have a real tree. Well, the corporate manual wasn't made for emergency, SOS, save-our-store-by-Christmas moments, now was it? Wow. Look at you go. Okay. Marta, we're getting a real Christmas tree. I know just the spot, follow me. Good. Great. Yes. Grant, we just passed 16 perfectly good trees. No, no, no, no. Trust me, good ones are at the back. Follow me. Is this where you come to get your tree? Every year. You know this used to be a lumber yard actually, when I was a kid. I didn't know, no. Well it's where my grandpa Henry got his start, actually. Pulled long hours, saved up enough and opened Trinket Town. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Why didn't you just reopen Trinket Town? Well, turns out banks don't trust kids who have no experience. But you said your dad was a financial planner. He could have helped. No, no. He thought that I should, you know, be doing something more respectable, professional, profitable. Oh, okay. What about now? You have all this experience, you could get a startup loan, no problem. Well, man, I have employees now and. Okay, part of me thinks that, maybe it wouldn't live up to what it used to be if I was at the wheel. But my grandpa was a special guy. I mean, he whittled toys from scrap lumber that he'd find on his lunch breaks. Actually, we could find you some scrap lumber probably. You could take some home with you. Are you serious? Why would I take scrap lumber home? For your toy line. Oh, well, it's not a toy line, and I don't know how to whittle. I just draw. Oh, I could help you with that. I still have my grandfather's carving knife. No, you don't need to do that. Well, I'd like to do that. I mean, if that's what you imagine, right? I just assumed that they would be wood, not plastic because, hey, you mentioned that you loved the reindeer so much. Yeah, that is how I imagined it. Wood, not plastic. All right then well, you know what that means. - No. - Mm-hmm. What? You're gonna have to show me your sketches. - No. - What? Come on. Why not? I don't know, I don't wanna make you do anything that's so. What, important to you? Juvenile. Juvenile? Why do you do that? What, do what? That. Not doing anything. Yeah, you just did it again. I'm just looking for trees. Look, stop. Making toys is not easy. It's not frivolous or naive, but think about how much toys impacted you when you were a kid, how much they impact you now, even as an adult. I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but at the end of the day, it's still a business, so there's gonna be market research and product testing. - Wow. - Yeah. But you know this stuff, you have experience with this. I have done a little market research. Things are trending towards nostalgia, and back to the basics, is a draw. See, you're doing it right now. Are we gonna get a tree? We should get a tree, don't you think? Yeah. Yeah. I just need to say one more thing. The next time I ask to see your sketches, don't talk yourself out of it. Okay? Okay. Okay. I think this is it, yeah? Yeah, looks great. - Okay. - You got this, I'll pay. ♪ Angels we have heard on high ♪ ♪ Sweetly singing o'er the plains ♪ ♪ And the mountains in reply ♪ I think I'm done. No, it's nice. No, it's really nice. Yeah? Have you thought about using more silver garland? What, you don't like it? I can basically see my reflection in it. Yes, that's great. Hey, hey, hey! Hi! So, did you get the thing that I asked for yet? Mm-hmm. You didn't tell me what it's for? No. You know like those little tiny Santa toys that you can get? Yeah. I tried to buy one, but mom said no. So then I tried to buy one myself, but mom wouldn't give me her credit card. You know, I kind of understand where she's coming from. She's nine. And a half. And still capable of accidentally purchasing 200 of something I can't return. Hey. I want to show you something. I was thinking about the problem. Yes. And I started to doodle, and I was wondering if this could work for Sally Claus? It's perfect. - Really? - Where are they? Oh, well they're not toys yet. They're just drawings. Oh. But. I know, I'll use my elf dust to make them real! Slow down, honey. Come on, we gotta go. We're going, see you later. - Bye. - Bye. So, what you got there? Oh yes, you're here. Hi, welcome. Right this way. [Hestral] How's it going? It's going great. Just waiting for the last of these photos to upload, and then we should be good to go. You think it'll work? I do. - Okay. - Okay. What's in the box. Well, I'll show you if you show me your sketches. Oh, sneaky. Mm, I see what you're doing. - No. - Yes. Trying to make a deal, I think you should take it. It's a good deal. Okay, fine. Okay. They're still a work in progress, okay? So, if you don't like them, you can just be honest as well. There's some dimensions that I still need to tweak in that. They're supposed to be simple, that's what I was going for. I didn't wanna add too many details so that the kids could add the details. You know, inspire imagination. They could create their own world and write their own rules. Okay, your silence is killing me. I like that. What? It just means you care about my opinion. Of course I care about your opinion. I mean, you're a professional in the industry. Right. Important opinion. These are incredible. Really? You got something really special here. Thank you. Thank you. Now, your turn. That's the one you were talking about, right? How? That's exactly how I remember it. It's yours, keep it. No, I can't keep this. This is from your grandfather. We made a deal, fair and square. It's yours, please keep it. Why are you being so nice to me? You're supposed to hate corporate minions. I do. It just turns out that you're the furthest thing from a corporate minion that I can imagine. Hey, I was wondering if maybe, you know, we could- Oh, that's Steph, I have to meet her for the pitch practice tonight. Okay. Good luck. - Thanks. - All right. Oh, hey. They're gonna go for it, don't worry. What if they don't? What's Grant gonna do? Grant? So we're on a first name basis now. Oh, I mean, well we, yes, we are. You're rattled. No, I'm not rattled. Yes, you are. And you only get rattled when you're really into someone or completely horrified by them. You really like him. You know, you and Grant are very similar. Never know when to let up, especially about my toy designs. Wait, you told him about your toy designs? I did. Whoa, that's- Insane. Crazy, stupid. - I know. - No. I also told him I could save his store. What am I doing? It's okay. We got this. Run it again. Flagships build brand power through store experience. They're a place for discovery, excitement, connection and fun. Perfect. Making it the perfect location for Big Teddy Toy Company's very first flagship store. Well, it's an interesting proposal. But I have concerns with the location. Is it really central enough to be a flagship? Well, I can assure you that this store's reputation continues to spread, and with a larger marketing budget, we can increase traffic significantly. Thank you, Charlie. We'll take it into consideration. You know, maybe you should see it in person before making any decisions. There's just something that statistics and spreadsheets can't show you. In fact, they are hosting a holiday party tonight. You and your families should come on down. That's a great idea. We'll be there. Fantastic. And we'll see you there. Okay. There you go, Ryan. Oh, Marta, a return. Oh. Hey. Hey. So how'd it go? Oh no, good. Good? Yeah, really good. - But. - What? The board wants to come here. What, here? When? Tonight. Tonight? I kind of told them that we are having a holiday party. A party, okay. I just needed a way to get them in the store so that they could see the potential for themselves. Oh Grant, I'm so sorry. Are you mad? No, no, not at all. I'm just trying to figure out where to start. Oh, great. Yeah, where to start. I want them to feel the magic of the store, you know, it already looks so good. Yeah, but we wanna blow their socks off. Exactly. Bring in appetizers, maybe desserts. Oh, I love desserts, yeah. And we'll put out the arts and crafts table. Yes, and set up games. Absolutely, I love games. We don't have a lot of time. - No. - We need help. Yes. Okay, I will ask Marta and Ryan if they can stay late, and I'll see if Izzy can bring Emma. Oh, that would so would be perfect. 'Cause teamwork makes the dream work. You know it. Steph? What are you doing here? Oh, well I thought you could use an extra set of hands. Oh my goodness, we can. You are the best. Grant, this is Stephanie, my- Coworker, best friend, Bonnie to her Clyde, Louise to her Thelma. Excuse me, I'm Louise, you're Thelma. Oh, that's cute, you're 100% Thelma. I don't think so. We talked about this, so. Hi. Nice to meet you. Anyway.

Yeah, you look beautiful, it's perfect. Thanks. What do you got there? Open it. I snuck a peek at your sketches, and this isn't quite as good as what you drew, but I think it's close. You made these? Yeah, I used my grandfather's carving knives. I hope you don't mind. You gotta stop making me presents. Yeah, can't promise that. Are you ready for tonight? Yeah. You? Yeah.

But if it works out. Hey, Charlie. Great job. Very impressive. Thank you, David. - Hi. - Hi. What do you think? I think it looks like you flew Santa in right from the north pole. Looks good, huh? But seriously, tonight is incredible, Charlie. Win, lose or draw, you should be really proud of yourself. You laid it all on the line. Yeah, I guess I did. So, are you finally gonna tell him how you feel, or am I gonna have to do it for you? You wouldn't dare. Oh, I most certainly would. Stephanie. Hi, Gertrude. I'll leave you two ladies to it. Charlie, what a lovely evening. Thank you. I'm so glad that you're enjoying yourself. Board and I are very excited about some of the ideas you put forward. Great. Yeah, oh, what a relief. Your pitch was spot on. And what you've done tonight has proven that a flagship store is the answer we've been looking for. Really? David has connected the board with a great location in Las Vegas that I think will really carry the sales we're looking for. In Las Vegas? I thought we were- I know it's unexpected. It's all been happening very quickly. But you have done some great work here, Charlie, and I would love to sit down with you and talk next steps. Yes, of course. The Vegas store will open up a lot of opportunities I think you'd be great for. Anyway, we're pulling the team together for a meeting in the morning, we can talk then? Mm-hmm, yeah. Thank you for a wonderful evening. Thank you for coming. Hey, there you are. Couldn't find you. Did you hear anything yet? They've decided that Vegas is a better place for our flagship store. Vegas? Yeah. Okay. I'm so sorry. I feel like I should have known. I mean, the odds were never in our favor. You should never have trusted corporate. Maybe it's not all bad. I mean, I could get you a really great severance package. But if you think I care about a severance package, then clearly you don't know me. I meant you could use it to reopen Trinket Town. It's your dream. What about you? What about your toy line? I don't have a toy line, Grant. Okay, you want me to trust and believe in my dreams, but you're not willing to admit what yours are? Yeah, I'm not you. You don't have to be. I'm not spontaneous and playful and magical. I'm a data analyst for a reason. Why do you think you chose to work at a toy company? To take the leap. I can't. It's not me. I'm sorry, I gotta go. All right, everyone bring it in. - Morning. - Morning. There's no easy way to say this, I'm just gonna say it. Corporate has decided that it would be a good idea to close all their stores. Now I know this comes as a shock, and not the best time of year. But you know what? I'm gonna help each and every single one of you stay on your feet, I promise you that, okay? If you have any questions at all, anything, do not hesitate to call me, write me, text me, show up at my front door, okay? Outside these four walls, you're still my team. That's it. Matt, we're gonna find you something, all right? Thanks, boss. Keep your chin up, all right? Marta. I am so sorry. It's not your fault, Grant. We'll figure something out. We always do. Yeah. Hey. Thanks for coming. Just wanted you to hear it from me. Hey. It's gonna be all right, Em, okay? But I don't understand. We all made elf dust wishes. I know. I'll talk to her. You okay? Not really, no. Well, there's always Trinket Town. Come on, not you, too. We both know when we were kids you always wanted to run that place. Izzy, that sounds crazy. Especially considering one of the largest toy chains in the country just closed all their stores. No, it doesn't. And yes, the world is changing fast, but you've always found a way to set yourself apart. You did it for this store, you can do it again. Maybe. Look, I get it. When I first adopted Emma, you don't think I was nervous. I was terrified. I was worried that no matter how much I loved her, I'd never be able to give her a traditional family. You're a fantastic mom. I try, but she's got you and everyone else here. And we made our own family, she's thriving. But I never would've known how amazing this turned out, if I hadn't given it a chance. I get what you're saying. But, it just wouldn't be the same. You know? You gotta stop putting Grandpa on that pedestal. He was just a guy who loved kids and wanted to create a place that would inspire them. Sounds like someone I know. For the first time since I've known you, you went after something you believed in. And just because it didn't work out exactly how you had hoped, doesn't mean you haven't been the happiest I've ever seen you before. That's not failure. That's growth. You really think so? Yes, absolutely. And it's not even taking into account all of this. Are these your designs? Grant made them. He made these? Wow, you've got this guy hooked. Not anymore. You should have seen him look at me, Steph, just disappointment in every way imaginable. That's not really fair. You worked really hard to save that store. He wasn't even disappointed about the store. He wants me to quit my job and focus on the toy line full time. I think that's a great idea. No. No. Yes. You could start online and in a few small stores with very little risk to you. You really think I can do it? Absolutely. You're my Thelma. I'm your Louise, you're my Thelma. I don't know. I was just a kid when I dreamed up being a toy designer. Stop, you've wanted this since you were a kid, there's a big difference. Just because something doesn't seem practical doesn't mean you can't do it. You're allowed, even if you think you're too grown up. Now, grab a donut and your bag. We are going to be late for work. Let's go. Come on. And as David just mentioned, we will be shuttering all our east coast stores after Christmas, just in time to launch our Vegas flagship store in the New Year, any questions you know where to find me. Enjoy your holiday. Charlie? Hey, Charlie. I'm sorry about store 24. Yeah, me too. It was a good call with the flagship angle. That was smart. Thank you. You certainly ran with it. Well, I saw an opportunity and I did what I thought was best. For who? Look Charlie, I know you've gotten close to those people, but don't take it personally. It's just business. Maybe it shouldn't be. Just stick with the numbers, Charlie, that's what you're good at. Terrific. I'll talk to you soon. Do you have a moment? Yes, of course. Have a seat. You know Charlie, the board and I have just been discussing personnel shifts. We've been so excited about the work you're doing, and we're wondering how you'd feel about becoming VP of data processing. Wow. We'd move you to an office in Vegas. I think you'd be a perfect fit. Thank you. But I have to say no. I want to design toys. I already do actually. And I wanna do it full time. I'm so sorry. Don't you apologize. Do what you want, and whatever that is, I know it'll be terrific. Thank you. You're welcome. So? I did it, I quit. What? We're gonna need more donuts. Hey, mom. Yeah, honey? Is the elf dust really magic? Well, why do you ask that? Because none of the wishes I made this year came true. Well, just because it didn't come true right away doesn't mean it won't come true eventually. Some things take time. It's Christmas Eve already. I know, honey. Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Hey guys. What can we get ya? Nothing actually, I came to give you something. What is it? Well, go on. Open it. No, way. They're my first prototypes, hand-carved by your very own Uncle G. Mommy, you see these? I saw, it's amazing. It's just like your drawing. I designed them for you, for your Santa house. Thank you so much. You're welcome so much. See, mom, this is Santa, and he's like Uncle G. And this is Sally Claus. She's just like you. She's in charge of all the elves. And I'm Rudolph, obviously. - Obviously. - Obviously. Charlie, you have no idea how much this means to us. Truly. Emma is a great kid. I couldn't think of anyone better to try my new toy line out on. Wait, so you don't work for Big Teddy Toy Company anymore? No, I don't. I think I'm gonna need some more candy cane bark. Only if it's on the house, this time. I don't know. I think it should go here, by the cash. How'd you know I was here? Izzy. Another bribe. Think she'd be upset if I started selling this stuff here? Does that mean what I think it means? Trinket Town, coming soon. I'm so happy for you. And it looks amazing in here. Marta and Ryan are gonna help me after the holidays. Well, let me tell you what I'm doing. So right back there, it's gonna be a permanent crafting station. Santa chair, that's gonna stay out year round, gonna turn it into the new book nook. Amazing. Over here I'm gonna take this wall out, and put in a new and improved play area. No corporate displays allowed of course. Oh, obviously. Charlie? I'm sorry. I have felt terrible since you left. I shouldn't have pushed you so hard to quit your job. I was just really- Right. You were right. I quit my job. I was so terrified to admit that I wanted to design toys, and you, well, you just took it seriously right from the beginning. You're amazing, Grant. I'm serious though, I don't have a job anymore. So if you have shelf space for a newbie, I'd be super appreciative. Remember that elf dust story I told? Of course. The green and red tights were really unforgettable. I wished for this. You and me. You didn't. I did. Wow. So did I.
