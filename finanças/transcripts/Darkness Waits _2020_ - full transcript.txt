Seriously you guys? What is that? - That, I believe is photographic evidence of a shadow ghost. Sometimes called shadow people, dark entities, black mists. Evil Sprits? - Western society kind of has us programmed to think that anything related with darkness is associated with evil or demonic spirits. So they can be bad? - Believers feel that shadow ghosts are genuine ghosts. People who passed on physically, but not necessarily made it to the other side spiritually. It's not uncommon to find the reports detailing their Earrhly clothing. If you look close, you can almost make out a long coat and a hat. Hats get reported all the time. Damn. Is that the girl from the film? - These are the actual crime scene photos. Taken in fairly close proximity to the swimming hole. All four of them had been shot with a .22 caliber rifle. No arrest was ever made. They didn’t even have a suspect. What if it's not even a ghost? What if it's their killer? - These images have been recorded by - hikers, photographers, park rangers, and even early settlers. So these have been happening for over a hundred years. And I find that each one closely resembles the figure captured in the film. - Is it the same figure in all of the pictures? - Most shadow ghosts do seem attached to a more specific location. I looked up Dead Womans Hollow Road and get this… Natives named the area, after a woman who was bitten by a snake, died there. - Untimely deaths are nothing new to the area. - And that's why I’ve chosen it as the next location for our project. What? How far away is that? A few hours, I think. A few hours? And how long are we shooting for? Until we get what we need. Maybe all weekend. This is some bullshit. Why the hell can’t we just do it here? Here doesn't exactly qualify as a hotbed for paranormal activity. There is absolutely no reason it should take us all weekend to do this. Well, that depends. On? On whether or not we capture shadow ghost. Capture? Like on camera. So what your saying, is that chances of me, trapping any beaver pelts this weekend, are uhh, pretty much slim to none. You know Ryan, you're never gonna fuck me. You know that, right? Right there. If we get the shot we'll pack up and go home. All for a hoax. Some made up, found footage, ghost chasing. I verified the events. They happened. So how does this movie, shot on film mind you, find its way on the internet in the first place? Isn't it like police evidence? Darryl you and Megan are responsible for your own wardrobes. So you might wanna consider wearing a little bit more cover than usual. Pan... tees. You don't wear any underwear? - Only when I know I am going to be taking them off. I haven't had any luck securing permits from the local authorities, so we may have to shoot this guerrilla style. - Or commando style, in Megan’s case. From what I could gather, the local sheriff had been let go… so the department was kind of under transition. Well, why was he let go? He got drunk and beat a black man in his custody, with a baseball bat. ♪♪♪ What's up Jeff? Hey... Hi. Brought some donuts. Buck, I believe I speak for each of us, when I say thank you, for coming in on your day off. Mayor. I'm sure you know Bob Billy? - Of course. Best breakfast in town.

Charmed. - Buck you put in for sheriff some time ago? Yes? - Correct. And you probably wondered why you were overlooked immediately following the release of Hatsley? I did at first, yes. Well, its been a long road back. Not only for the department, for the entire community. A community who’s trust, in those sworn to protect and serve was shattered. A department who's image, was run through the muck. Found itself on the hot seat. Harassment. Racism. You name it. - Not to mention the negative effect it has on economic growth and opportunities Tell me, what kind of experience do you have, outside of the academy? Uhhhh…Just practical. Everything I learned here. On the job. Under Hatsley. - You see Buck, if the experience you have thus far - You see Buck, if the experience you have thus far Revolves around whatever training you received from Hatsley, as your mentor. Wouldn't it be safe to assume that whatever, philosophies and values he had… - No one is interested in another shoot from the hip cowboy making our jobs more difficult. - Sure. I mean you know what they say about bad mistakes and old habits. Absolutely. And if I were in your position I'd feel the same way. Ummm, was I trained by Hatsley? Yes. Am I an advocate for the former sheriff? No. Not at all. Trust. Goes back to trust. Without it, you loose your ability to police. Crime goes up. Then our economic outlook goes down the shitter. We have several business proposals that we are shopping around as we speak Some are more time sensitive then others. But they're all going to require tremendous support from the people if we are going to move forward. Do you still associate with Ward? - Ummm... just in passing. I mean, it's hard not to in this town. Well, we really wanna be sure there's no, conflict of interest. Usually just no more than hello. Well, if you can keep it to that. You can start first thing tomorrow morning All right. Under a watchful probationary period of course. - Of course. Ahh, thank you sir. Uhhh... I won't let you down. Ummm. Gentlemen. Charlene. You sure type fast. Your giving me bad ideas. So what do you say? I buy ya a case of beer, fill up your tank? I'll even introduce you to, Bruce Banner. I don't understand this.

Either of you assholes have any idea how retarded you sound right now? We only need to capture a shadow ghost. What the fuck are you talking about?

It's not really original. - She said having a black host, will separate them from all the others. Well, if there is one thing the world needs more of than a reality ghost show it's another Ernie Hudson. - Oh. Ok. Good one. Good one. Your girl picked it. Who? Jess? Yeah. She's the producer. She's awfully demanding. I know all about that Darryl. Thanks for pointing it out. - Exactly dude, that's what I'm saying that's why you need to do this. All right. Now that is a big ass trail, and you want me runnin' around out there, stumblin' around in the damn dark? It's not like that dude. All you gotta do, go out there during the day, find the swimming hole, and then just wait for us. You'll text me? - Yeah I’m gonna text you. I’m gonna buy one of those pay by the minute phones. Seriously. And then Jess is going to collect all the other phones. Turn them off, that way there is no interruptions for audio recording. But, how do you know she's not just gonna follow you? - Dude she's gonna be too fuckin' busy. - Too busy, - watching us and trying to direct us from the monitors from the campsite. Trust me.

So, what's wrong with the cruiser out front? Ahhh, I got good news and bad news. Cool. Uhh, I guess, what's the bad news? The cruiser has a busted torque converter or something. Ouch. Umm, ok.

The ranger dispatched never did spot Jesse, - but did report hearing gunshots during his search. Randall eventually found him, but when he did he noticed some blood around his mouth, figured maybe somebody got spooked and took a pot shot at him. So he brought him here. And sure enough, during the initial examination Lon was able to extract a .22 caliber slug from around Jesse's mouth. So, who shot him then? Campers? This is where it gets weird. Lon wasn't able to find an entrance or exit anywhere on Jesse. He figured maybe he picked it up somewhere accidentally. So he called me down to test the blood samples we took from his fur My initial thinking was, maybe he picked it up somewhere snacking on a dead rabbit or squirrel. So, what kind of test then?

Inside. ♪♪♪ So, is she all right? Sure. Don't she look it? - Do you wanna talk? Shit in one hand. Want in the other. My mother always used to say that. Ohh... Jesus. Isn't that why you brought me all the way out here? You know, heaven forbid anyone see us together. In pubic, you know talking that is. What, do you want from me? I wanna know what changed. Things are different. Ha yeah, politically speaking you mean? Meaning, I can't keep feeding you privileged information on this case. Or any other case past or future. - I know I said I would. And I did. - For a long time. Way longer than I should have. - It's my own fault and I'm sorry. I never should have agreed to it in the first place but uhh... I care about my job. I'm not ashamed to admit that. So I thought you wanted to help me catch this guy. You want to catch this guy. I just care about the law. Oh well that just sounds about right cuz you sure as shit don't care about justice. How do you mean? All I'm trying to say is that the law's... well, it's not without limitations. - Yeah, you're the expert on that. Still. This isn't right. You're putting innocent people in harm's way. You know that's the one thing about you Buck. You've always thought that there is such a thing as innocent lives. - All I know is, whatever crusade you've got cooked up just, leave me out of it. Look. In a few short hours, a media circus is going to descend on our quiet little town. Now, you're gonna be playing the part of the clown. The local hay seed sheriff in over his head. The polar opposite of what your ringleader's want on display. I did the best I could. With the resources I had. You get what you get. And you don't complain about it! Now just save it for the choir! - Now, - once you'r relieved of your position, because, you know, when the real police take over. This very liberal media is gonna start spinnin' this shit into it's ongoing narrative on gun control. Unless, you're willing to flip the script. How do you expect me to? Well, this little lady here is going to be your meal ticket. - No way. Absolutely not. Look Buck, I saw him. It was him! Flesh and bone. - We can not use this girl as bait. How are you going to guarantee her safety. If I wanted to keep her out of harm's way, I would've just shot her myself. - Jesus. Christ. You are fucking certifiable! Buck if you want to win, you gotta make sure you can do what the other guy won't. Even if it means throwing her to the big bad wolf? Well, the wolves gotta eat too. Why are we here? I mean, I remember, waiting for an ambulance, but, nothing between then and, waking up here. Uh, our position got, umm, compromised. We had to reroute you for safety, and this was the most secure location. But, couldn't you have radioed someone? Hell, I don't know. I guess in the end we're all, monsters. - She thinks she saw Leroy too. Wait. Who's Leroy? The man in the sketch? A local folklore. A mountain man uh, livin' in caves along the trails, he walks in the shadows. Appalachia's version of the angel of death except uh, carrying a rifle instead of a scythe. No but he's real. I saw him. Darkness. Darkness waits. What does that mean? The wicked, lie and wait, for the righteous. Intent on putting them to death. Now you can call him whatever you want, but that boogie man is gonna come a knockin'. Thank you Dr. Loomis. Ahh, god dammit, Wally! That's usually my line. What the hell are you two doing here? Well, Sheriff, er, Ward, called us in. I called for back up. Back up. Well, I'm surprised to see you back up so soon after your, life threatening injury. Hey, show Dick some respect. Dick here, is the ahh, president of drama club back in school. Exactly what does that have to do with the fact that you hijacked this girl's ambulance? I'm a method actor. - I had him tie up the ambulance. I didn't know how else to insure that she stay put. Wait, wait, wait but, you said that our position had been compromised. What, did you guys just, lie to me? It was like ahh, it was more like a misstatement. - Which is a cinnamon for lie. Synonym, Wally! Christ., geesh. You guys said it was for my safety. We said what we had to. - Why would guys lie like that? Look we had to uh, Bam! Bam! Little pigs, little pigs. Little pigs, little pigs! Down! I'm scared. Please, I don't want to die. Jess!? Oh my God. All clear. I got... I got him. Where is he? Well, we got him all right. See I told ya I hit him. Yeah. I don't think it's who we thought it was. Is that a fake beard? ♪♪♪ The water level out there really really went down since we were out there. Well, I figured the big titty story would always sound more forgiving. Hell. I told it so much even I began to believe it. What are you telling me this? I don't know. The mayor's office will release a statement shortly. Do you know what's going on? Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. - Please your community deserves to know what's happened. Mr. Mayor. How many people have died? How many bodies were there? Not now. Not now. Hey, how are you. - Good morning. - Hey Mr. Mayor, how you doing good to see you? Good to see you. Good to see you. I guess ever now and again you just gotta... take out the trash. Bob Billy. Good to see ya. How you doing? Good. How are you. Doing good. Thank you. Buck. Mayor. - All he is, is a photo opportunity in a suit. Imagine that? Just came from the hospital. Fern's in good spirits, but a little foggy as to what happened out there. Yeah. Hopin' you can fill me in. - Yeah, ahhh, everything happened so fast. Yeah I reckon so. Fern's a trooper, I'm optimistic. You share that same optimism for Dwight? - Tell you what I do share. People of this community, are going to rest easier at night, knowin' the man on watch, protecting them, is a bonafide hero. You done good Buck! - I don't know if a, if a hero under a probationary watch is ahh. - No, no, no, no, you're about to be made official. I'm gonna make the announcement in a few minutes, in the press conference. But, I need details for now. - Right. So, let's start with the shooter. - Sure, umm, the shooter was a Travis Walton 23 years old, male, college dropout. - His ex girlfriend, - Jessica Bates, was one of the shooting victims, and we don't think these killings were random. So, revenge? - Well, our sources say there was a nasty break up. There was some infidelity on her part, he went a little crazy, she got a restraining order, might of pushed him over the edge. - He was found dressed as the perpetrator described from last years killings, down to the .22 caliber rifle. - His car was found on an old utility road, apparently he made a few calls and texts to ahh, one of the ahh, deceased victims. A co-conspirator? - Possibly, umm, I think he just helped Walton find Bates. I don't think he knew what else was going on. So everyone else was? Collateral damage. Wrong place, wrong time. Sphewww Juicy. - Would it be unfeasable to assume that Mr. Walton was dressed, like the past shooter because that's exactly who he was? - His finger prints, clothes and hair fibers were found both in the cave as well as the bus. Apparently he's been coming up here for some time. I don't think so. It just doesn't fit his profile. - There's absolutley no motive for last years killings. - Could be a copy cat but, no, I mean, well the finger prints on the inside, they were more like, like, like claw marks trying to get out but, it doesn't make sense if you've been living there. Well maybe he cut himself uh, cleaning fish. All right, well did you talk to Jack? - I did. So you read the report? - Just spit it out Buck. Ok, we need to both be on the same page out there, so we're not public spectacles. - So you saw that Travis had no tongue? Well that's the reason for the falling out with the girl. I imagine eating pussy was not too high on her list of... reasons to stay together. - That's classy. If you don't have a tongue, why in the world would you call somebody? You could just text. Why would call someone that you just gunned down like, and left for dead? You some sort of expert now on the, behavior of mutes? Bate's head wound. That was a point blank range shot. That's not uncommon in a revenge killing. - No, its not. - But our man would have to get past all four of us under heavy fire, get into the cabin, shoot the girl, and just, waltz outta there like ahh, ghost. Buck, how many gun fights have you been in prior to this? I mean, wouldn't you agree, that it's within the realm of possibility, to over look some details, in the heat of the moment? - Yeah, I do. Thats why I think Travis was a decoy. Our man could just slip in, slip out undetected. I think you've seen to many movies. Bad movies. Why did't he call out for help when he had the chance? I'm not expert on mutes but uhh I think it's pretty hard to call out for help when you don't have a tongue. And people are shooting at you in the middle of the dark. - Buck. I appreciate your concerns. Ok. You are doing one hell of a thorough investigation for us and I applaud the effort. But the difference between wild speculations and hard concrete evidence in this case is vast. The was we have to assess this... - Ballistics. - Travis's gun was registered to his father. I read the report. So you read that his gun was never fired. It's factory new out of the box. Look the big bad wolf is still out there. And you're acting like the mayor of Amity Island who won't close the beaches. - This case is as good as closed. You just have to make it so. - Instead you choose to drag it out. As if the victims families haven't suffered enough. Days become years. And for what? The big bad wolf isn't going anywhere. That's a fact. And nothing you can do can change that. - He's been there from the beginning. - And no matter what you do The big bad wolf always gonna be there Buck. You have to wrap your head around that. - What the people don't know... won't hurt them. That's the way it's always been Buck. - Because rest assured, I'm not going to be made a fool of again. You understand me? Now what's it gonna be? - Where the hell do you think you are going? Is it your turn, to beat an innocent man with a baseball bat, in the name of vigilante justice? You keep walking out that door and turn your back on me and you're finished! You hear that? You're finished! You know what your problem is Mayor? You still think there is such a thing as innocent people. Sheriff, whats going on? What did the mayor say?
