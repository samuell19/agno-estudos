Well, at least they can't call you Charly - No Dick. - Yeah. - [Hoo Ha] You call that hot? Anyway... I wanted to apologize to you for reacting so weirdly when you asked if we... - Oh, right. Pff. - You know... [Hoo Ha] No, not "pff." - It's not that I don't want to. - [Willy] We want to! We don't have to talk about that. [Hoo Ha and Willy] Exactly. Let's just do it. Now, under the stars. You're really important to me as a friend. - Yeah. - [Hoo Ha] No. Huh? - Ditto. - [Hoo Ha and Willy] What? Oh, come on! [Willy] Man. - Oh! - [Hoo Ha groans] Oh man. [crickets chirping] Something's different about you. Did you get a haircut or change your makeup? - No. - I could swear something different. Hmm.

Told you. Now you get it? I didn't want to say anything, but I mean, she totally blew the sex shop guy. [together] No shaming. I admit, one time, I got a huge boner from a pair of oranges that I saw one day. They really looked like the ones on my Spanish teacher. Sometimes I get hard on the bus because the seat vibrates. I call it a bus boner. Sometimes my dick gets hard when the sun shines on it. Sometimes I get... Wait a minute. Why is everything about penises? It's just not funny when it's you. I mean, sometimes I have to spend hours just walking around here with a boner. It feels like everyone just stares at me all day. To be honest, most of my erections just kind of happen randomly. Like, I'll just be sitting in my grandpa's house, where nothing is sexy, and I just have a hard-on. Sometimes, it's just really weird like that. Hey, Digger. No one wants to hear about your boner. [Willy] See what we started? - You're an actual role model. You can... - Hi, Charly. - [Willy] Oh my God, Marlene! - Marlene. Um, well, I wanted to ask you. I'm having a small party this weekend. Yep, I heard. Everyone's talking about it. [Marlene] Exactly. It's gonna be totally awesome. Marlene's into Charly. Crazy. Who'd have thought? Bull crap. The whole school's going. - Oh right, you're not. - [friends chuckle] If you can, I'd love it if you'd come by for a while. - Yeah? - Uh, yeah, for sure. Okay, see you then. [Willy] Uh, I could just squeeze out a little tear. Dude, I'm so proud of you, man. Two hot toddies. You know what that means? That I now have a big problem. - [girl] Trying to make Constantin jealous? - No way. I think Charly's really cute. Ew. Hey, Dad. - Do you just live here now? - Sh. - He's an eavesdropper. - [Charly] What? - The gardener. See? - What? - I have a problem, I think. - Okay. Shoot. This French exchange student asked me to go out with her. Doesn't sound like a problem to me. Uh, excuse me? Do you mind? It's a private talk. Yeah? And? The problem is that the coolest girl at school invited me to her house for a party. Mm. Do you like one girl more than the other? No. There's a simple answer there. Bring the exchange student to the party as your date. Yeah, but, maybe... I once went out with a girl and her sister at the same time. - That's what I'm saying. - [gardener] He asked us for advice. - He asked me for my advice. Me. - That doesn't mean to have to yell at me. - Who's yelling? - You're getting aggressive. I'm not being aggressive. Well, maybe you should get anger management therapy. I don't think I need that kind of therapy, man. No. - You live in your office. - [chuckles] What a butt load of bullshit. We can see you. - [Rudi] When? - At night, when you dance. You spy on me? Yeah, me and, uh, Maggie from the kitchen, Alexander, the trash guy. All of us. Hey, Paula. [Hoo Ha gasps] Yay! Okay, stay cool, sweetheart. - Hi. - Hi. [chuckles] Um, are you going to Marlene's party this weekend? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. - Yeah? Um, I thought it would be cool for us to go, you know, together if you want. [Hoo Ha] And we're wet. - Uh, yeah. I'd like that a lot. - Yeah? - Okay, cool. Yeah, um, I'll be there. - Okay. [chuckles] Oh my God. What just happened? [Hoo Ha] We are so going to hit that later.

We have to keep her juices flowing. - Ah bon? This is an interesting party. - [Willy] Quick. Say something. - Yeah. - [Willy] Be a little more creative. - Cool. - [Willy] Ask her a question. - You want a drink? - [Willy] Not that question. - Shots? - [Willy] What? - Join me? - [Willy] Charly!

[somber music playing] After all of this, we're so done. - Paula, please. - We have a deal? We have a deal. - [Willy] Whoa, that's really hard. - [sighs] [Willy chuckles] Unlike me. Ha. Ha ha.

Oh, so that's what you need me for, Charly? That's not what I said.

I think she has a crush on Marko or Markus. [laughs] He's a little devil though. [laughs] Hi, Françoise. So Sorry. - Oh, your outfit. C'est chouette. - Thanks. Oh, um, I catch up with you in a bit, okay? [chuckles] Listen, I know he doesn't deserve it, but I could really use a favor. Okay. What can I do? Well, first of all, this little prick wants to apologize to you. [chair squeaking] Yes, um, Françoise. I'm so incredibly sorry about it all, and I really wish I knew what happened, but I don't remember. Um, yeah, I know that sounds like an excuse, but I totally blacked out at Marlene's party that night. Yeah. Makes you wish you were into girls. [chuckles] Did I ever say I wasn't? Nah. You really don't recall? D'accord. Alors... Everything was fine at first. We had a lot of fun. We danced, drank. But then... [dance music playing] Come, Charly. Françoise, don't worry. When I get back, it's your turn. [Willy] Yeah, Charly. Two babes. [Françoise] Yes. I never even said I wanted to sleep with you. I'm so sorry. Really. I... I don't usually drink a ton of alcohol, and I was totally wasted that night. He's been asking his dick for advice. - All guys do that. - Mm, yeah, but with this one... Paula, I... I think that we got it. Okay. What do you say we teach a lesson to an asshole who's an asshole when he's sober?

Hi, Miss Voigt. Say, what exactly happened with your exams? Uh, it's complicated. Have you heard this? A wise man once said, "Don't let your schooling interfere with your education." Oh, wow. That really is quite wise. Well, did you know that an even wiser woman once said, "I'll see you next year, kid"? Hey, guys! I, um... I... I mean, I've never felt so free. That's great. I'm so glad. - Oh my God. I forgot. - What? Somebody knocked the lights out on your bike. - [Constantin] Oh. - [bat clatters] Oh God. Uh, you said lights, I think, but only one is broken. - Huh. That's right. - [shatters] - [Charly and Françoise gasp] - That one was for calling me a slut. [Constantin] Wha... Oh, fuck. Fuck. Uh... It's over, Constantin. Betrayal. - Marlene. Wait! - Asshole. Mm. Mm. Don't touch me like that! You fat ass! [gasps] I didn't want to say anything, but you've really put on weight. - Yeah, and you stink. - [gasps] You know what? Your giant feet are way too big for your little body. Plus, we hate Mr. Fluffles. He has aggression problems. Hmm. No shaming! Mr. Fluffles does not have aggression problems! - Did you seriously give me the finger? - Marlene, wait. She fell into my lap. It was an accident. Marlene. So you are definitely the coolest students here. To be honest, I only did this exchange program to have a little bit of fun. If you guys are interested, I would be up for a ménage à trois. - Hmm? - [bat clatters on ground] I think I'm saving myself for a special girl. Uh, thanks. We'll get back to you on that. Okay, my offer stands. Call anytime. See you. [Willy] What they hell was that? Is everyone deaf? Charly, come on. Um... so you've moved on to someone new? Actually, I've known her for a while. But I screwed it up. I was an idiot. [Willy] Quick! Françoise is over there. We can catch up with her. [Hoo Ha] Okay, I think we nailed it. Let's go to the after-party. I see. I guess we're done here. I, um... I guess so. [tender music playing] Sure. It was an honor to get to be your best friend for all these years. Okay. Bye. ["Soft & Hard" playing] - [Willy] I don't believe it. - [Hoo Ha] For real? - [Willy] Is this finally it? - [Hoo Ha] Oh my God. Oh my God. - [Willy] I think... - [Hoo Ha] More games. - [Willy] No, I think this is really it. - [Hoo Ha] Okay, we're doing it. - Help him.

Please. - But I shouldn't give up on myself. - No, I said you shouldn't give up on Mom. - [knocking] Oh God. I'm sweating like a pig. - Um, do I look all right? - Dad.

Mm, you're even prettier in person than you are in your profile picture. Beautiful hair. And lovely long legs, like me. [chuckles] Mm-hmm. It's Mom! Oh. Your profile didn't mention you had kids. Mm, well, I didn't wanna risk scaring you off right from the jump. The plan was first let's see how the date goes, and then I'd break it to you gently. Very funny. Charly, don't wait up for us. [Sabine] So, where are we going? I have a reservation at a nice restaurant pretty far out of town. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. Because I've been thinking of trying that yogurt place by the park. Oh, I love yogurt. Hopefully they have eggplant there, right? Eggplant, you say? Meow. [snarls] [gentle music playing] [car engine starts] [gentle music continues] All right, I'm ready. How far is the drive? Don't know. [Willy on radio] And we're back with the weather. There's a definite chance of a hard front coming in. [Hoo Ha] Yes, it'll be quite wet the next few days.
