(teletype machine clacking) (honky-tonk jazz music) - Where's Dismal Lane? - In a hurry? - I'm a reporter, Mister, hot on the trail of a story, a big story. Where's Dismal Lane? - What paper do you work for? - Journal-Herald. - The Journal-Herald? A continuing insult, the promiscuous breeding ground of distortion and lies. If you work for the Journal-Herald, I never heard of Dismal Lane. - Hey, you. Come back here. (clanking and rattling) Hey, I owe you a poke in the nose, buddy. What are you doing here? - Press. - What paper? - Journal-Herald. - You're Ames Herbert. Why didn't you say so? - Did you ask? - I'm Ray Smidgeon. It's my first assignment. I'm to tag along and-- - I was forewarned. - Sorry about the-- - Forewarned is forearmed, Mr. Smidgeon. - Do you really feel that way about the Journal-Herald? - Mr. Smidgeon, you can't interview me. I never talk to the press. Dr. Charles Lewis Gresham, I presume? - That's right. - Name's Herbert. Journal-Herald. - It's about time. You almost missed the whole thing. - This is Jack Smurch, the pilot. - I was number one barnstormer and stunt pilot. I can do the triple loop, boys, only from now on, them tricks is peanuts. Lindbergh? Don't make me laugh. Ain't nobody seen no flying, yet. Doc, don't you do that or I'll take you up and I'll push you over and you forgot your parachute and Doc, if you need one and you ain't got one, you won't need one again. - Gin? - My personal fuel. - Take some photographs of the plane, Mr. Smidgeon. How did you fix upon this mild-mannered young aviator? - I put an ad in the paper. - Surely you had more than one applicant? - I needed a man who could stay awake and alert four days. Therefore, I sought above all, a high degree of animal vitality. He doesn't look like a man who'd fall asleep and to be sure, he seems expended. - [Herbert] What are these cans attached to the plane? - I have devised an ingenious filtration system which thins gasoline to the point that the load and therefore the coefficient of drag is virtually non-existent and thus, depending on how far you intend to travel, thanks to my brilliant invention, all you do is add auxiliary tanks. - So, to demonstrate, he's going to fly around the world. - Yes. - Hey, Doc. I'm done. We've got a nice tailwind. Let's go. - Do you have the charts? - I got charts draining out of my ears. Hey, you guys. Hey, give me a hand. Hey, you, sap? You wanna get sliced into bacon? Stay right where you are. Don't move. - Don't forget to drop the unused tanks into the river before you land. - Sure thing, Doc. I'll see you Thursday. Hey, say "so long" to my Sweet Patootie, okay? - Hey, Jack. Don't get so cockeyed you can't fly. - You just remember what I said. Ain't nobody seen no flying ... Yet. (playfully adventurous music) Push, you palookas. Push. (engine sputtering and humming) Ha Ha. - The junk heap got off the ground. You may refer to that, if you must, as "the miracle of Dismal Lane." As for Jack Smurch, the less said about him, the better. In short, no story. - * My Bonnie lies over the ocean * My Bonnie lies over the sea * My Bonnie lies over the ocean * Oh ho ho oh ho ho ha ha - [Voiceover] The Governor of Illinois lies in critical-- hold on. I've just been handed a bulletin. We have just received word that the young American aviator, Jack Smurch, has crossed the Atlantic on the first leg of a proposed round-the-world non-stop flight in a tiny airplane. - No story, eh? You and your sidekick go to Chicago tonight. Drive over to Westfield, Iowa. Westfield, where Smurch grew up. Get the low-down on him, get back here Thursday before we go to press. Got that? Well, get it. Sheesh. (jazzy honky-tonk music) - [Smidgeon] You that sure he won't make it? - [Herbert] Not a chance. - [Smidgeon] You may be mistaken. There's something about him. He's got plenty of juice. - [Herbert] Not juice. Gin. No, Jack Smurch is a blowhard, a loudmouth, an idle braggart. - I think he'll make it. Two coffees, please. - No dust in mine. - Say, we're looking for somebody who is supposed to live here, Mrs. Emma Smurch. - You the law? - [Herbert] No. - Bill collector? - [Smidgeon] No, Ma'am. - You found her. - You're Emma Smurch? - [Smidgeon] Ain't I just said so? - Mrs. Smurch, we've come all the way from New York because your son, Jack, is going to fly a plane around the world without stopping. - Nothing you could say about Jack Smurch could interest me. - Is Jack's father around? - He don't live here no more. - Know where we might find him? - Number 165 Main Street, Preston. And if you see him, you tell him I said he got what he had coming. - Mrs. Smurch, did Jack have any childhood toys that he cherished? A sled or something? - He had a motorcycle when he was 13. - [Smidgeon] Would that be around here someplace? - No, he drove it through a drug store window, drunk. Didn't stick around to see how bad was the damage. - Do you have any childhood pictures of Jack? - That's the only one. - [Smidgeon] We'll give it right back. - You can keep it. - Mrs. Smurch, as a mother, how does it feel to know that your boy may pass away any time in the next few days, may in fact already be dead? - To hell with him. I hope he drowns. (jaunty upbeat music) - Look at him. - Bonjour, Frenchies, Bonjour. - [Voiceover] In what scientists describe as an impossible machine that will not work, an astonishing, imperfect Jacky Smurch hurtles across Europe like a thunderbolt. Wherever young Smurch is spotted in his in his tiny Dragonfly 2 Autoplane, there's dancing in the streets. - Yeah, I'm Jake Smurch. What can I do for you? - [Smidgeon] We're from a newspaper. We'd like to ask you a few questions about your son, Jack. - He kill somebody? - No, Sir. He's going to fly a plane non-stop around the world. - Jack? (chuckling) - Mr. Smurch, can you tell us anything about Jack's interests as a boy? - Well ... - Was he good in school? - No. No, no. Though he liked to read books about great men. Legs Diamond, Al Capone. School didn't make no difference to Jack, because he was born with practical know-how. Jack could fix anything. He couldn't have been more than 16 when he had a job as an auto mechanic. Then, one day ... - [Man] Hey, Smurch? Mind the store while I'm out. - [Smurch] Oh, yeah. Sure thing, Mack. (jaunty upbeat music) - Do you mean to say Jack stole that car, Mr. Smurch? - Oh, I wouldn't put it that way. Jack was like an explorer. He took it 'cause it was there. After he left reform school, Jack worked at the airport. Took flying lessons, learned to parachute drop. Jack dearly loved to parachute drop. I remember the day he taught his buddy, I.O. Whiffle. (honky-tonk music) - [Smidgeon] But, what happened to the plane? - Up in the air like that with nobody to pilot it? I often wonder. - * Roll me over * In the clover * This is number one * And the fun has just begun * Roll me over, lay me down and do it again * - Jack Smurch. I knew him well. Just before Smurch departed Westfield High for the last time, we were very close. Jack left me a gift which I carry to this day. - He knifed you? - Jack had strong opinions. - Hello, Russkys. Russkys, hello. - [Voiceover] Jacky Smurch, the Westfield, Iowa ex-mechanic's helper, is still awake and aloft and continues to baffle the experts as he captures the hearts and imagination of common men the world over. - Well? - Conklin's in conference. - Oh, no. Are we going to make the deadline? Suppose he goes to press before we get back? - He left word we are to proceed to Plucking and confront Miss Sweet Patootie. - The first time I saw Pal, I knew he was someone special. I was at work and the way he looked up to me, it wasn't like the others. It was more respectful-like. - Where were you working? - In burlesque. But, Jack changed all that. That's why I'm where I am today, folding flaps. - What does Jack Smurch mean to you, personally? - Clean-smelling breath when he holds me close. Even if he doesn't shave every day, it tends to make him feel closer somehow. - Doesn't he ever feel a trifle too close? - He does not sweat any more than he needs to, if that's what you mean. Except one time, I remember, he pushed me down and right there on the floor-- - Miss Duffy. this is a family paper. - And then he fell asleep on top of me with his shoes on, although not in a rude way. - Does Jack have any other attributes you admire? - He's wonderful. Warm, wholesome, modest and regular in all his habits. Listen, Pal is tough. He'll make it. - Before he took off, Jack said, "Say so long to my Sweet Patootie." - He did? Listen, Mister, was he all right? - Oh, alive and well, Miss Duffy. Alive and well. For the time being. (slow bluesy jazz music) - Patootie. - Where's Conklin? - [Conklin] Can't you see I'm in conference? This couldn't wait ten minutes? - Never mind that. Get rid of whatever you've got on the front page. What's the biggest type you've got? - 144 point. - Nothing bigger? - Has he gone mad? - Let's go inside. - Yes, Sir, Mr. Smidgeon. Whatever you say, Mr. Smidgeon. Boy, this better be good. - It is. Get this. Congenital hooligan Jack Smurch was barely 11 years of age when he commenced the first of many sojourns in a Preston, Iowa reform school. Smurch, feared and despised by his fellow townspeople-- - Give me that. Petty larceny? Grand larceny? Assault with a deadly-- Is this your idea of some kind of joke? - It's true, every word of it. The biggest scoop since Noah's Ark. Herbert said I could take it, right? - Mm-hm. - If I don't get an award for this, there's no justice. - Do you read the newpapers? Do you have even the vaguest notion of what a phenomenon we've got on our hands? As soon as this congenital hooligan was spotted flying over Paris, doing those figure-eights around the Eiffel Tower, all Europe went wild. Stalin just invited him to join the Communist Party. Japan calls him The Little Emperor. Right at this moment, he's flying over San Francisco and they're all going wild. If there was an earthquake there, nobody would hear it. If and when this congenital hooligan touches down, he's going to be the greatest hero in the land and you suggest that I print this mudslinging? This character assassination? - Listen, this is the truth. I swear it. - Young man, what I print is the truth. Until I print it, it's just sordid rumor. Hearsay. Didn't you bring back anything I can use? - Well, his girlfriend did tell us a nice story. It seems during those halcyon days back in Westfield, Iowa, Smurch took his aged grandmother for a ride and as they soared along, he gestured like this and warmly, wholesomely, with clean-smelling breath, he showed her what he claimed was the new world, the world of the air age. He said, first the country, then all the continents would be interconnected by invisible sky highways and all men would be brothers. - He didn't. She didn't. You made that up yourself. - So what? I like it. - I guess I should mention the time that Smurch saved his kid sister from drowning. - [Conklin] Really? - Smurch doesn't have a kid sister. - What difference could it possibly make? - We'll touch lightly on the incident where Smurch shoved a toddling infant out from in front of an on-rushing locomotive. He told her to drink milk, stay in school. - There's no railroad in Westfield, Iowa. - I don't care. It sounds good to me. Write it up, Herbert. Bring back any photographs? Hey. Nasty looking turd, isn't he? This will have to be retouched. Smidgeon? You keep your mouth shut about this. One peep out of you and your position here is terminated. Defunct, get it? What are you sitting there for? - He's hatching his hat. - What? Both of you get out of here. Close the door. Kott? Conklin here. I've got some information on Smurch I think may interest you. - Yes, I can't help but feel this untenuous swelling pride when I see the whole world resounding with praise for this noble son of our great nation. We pray that all-seeing providence will continue to bless the intrepid journey of dauntless Jacky Smurch. - We've been talking with Irwin Kott, Secretary of State. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. That's it. We're off the air. - And that, my colleagues, is what we know of Jack Smurch. In my opinion, the record, rather than being meager, is too complete. I stress again the urgency of ensuring the complete co-operation of everyone involved. Gentlemen, I ask you to join me in your hearts as I petition the Almighty. Dear Lord, let not his mother's prayer go unanswered. - To hell with him. I hope he drowns. (brass band playing patriotic music) - [Voiceover] Not five minutes ago, Smurch was sighted over New York City, where he did a triple loop above the Empire State Building and headed north across the Hudson to his rendezvous with destiny. - I guess you've got it coming. - Smurch hasn't landed yet. - You really hate his guts, don't you? - Oh, his personal grooming's not all it might be, but I have nothing against him, no. It's just that when you've been in the business as long as I have, Mr. Smidgeon, you learn to recognize a born loser. - How about it, Mr. Conklin? What your ace reporter called a flying junk heap is doing rather well for now, don't you think? - He's a great American. - It's him. He's coming in. - That's my man. I'm his Sweet Patootie. - [Smidgeon] He's everybody's man. From now on, everybody's going to be his Sweet Patootie. (applause and cheers) - Stay awake, stay awake. Everything's going to be okay. - Come on, Pal. - That's him all right, isn't it? That's him, isn't it? - Yes, yes. Give me your binoculars for a minute, Mr. Conklin? Oh, the idiot. He's still got the tanks. He's going to kill himself and ruin everything. - What are you talking about? - If he drops the unused fuel tanks when he lands, he'll explode the whole thing. We'll blow sky high. - He's still got those gasoline tanks. We're saved. It's a last minute reprieve. - Go back, go back. - What's he doing? - Go back, drop the tanks. Drop the tanks, Jack. - Can't somebody stop him? - Drop the tanks, drop the tanks. You'll explode. Go back, Jack. Drop the tanks. - Nitwit. - Get out of my way, you mook. I'll kill you. - Drop the tanks. - Drop the tanks. Damn it. (explosion) (screaming) (explosions) (screaming) - Come on, boy. Get that damn ball right in that socket, in that corner pocket. Right there. (applause and cheers) - Now that we've seen the manner of his revival, I wonder what Mr. Smurch will have to say to us. (honky-tonk music) - [Voiceover] Jack Smurch has just signed his name to a new chapter in the annals of aviation history, as his tiny Dragonfly 2 biplane touched down safely after his historic, round-the-world non-stop flight. Jacky's first words on arrival were, "It's great to be home," but a proud America will have to wait a day or two before clutching the lone aviator to her bosom. Smurch collapsed after leaving his plane and was rushed to a private hospital where he is recovering slowly. (upbeat jazzy music) - [Reporters] Mr. Secretary? Mr. Secretary? - Jacky Smurch is still suffering from exposure, but the brave lad's making the best of it I'm afraid, for the time being, a press conference is out of the question. Excuse me. - Hello. I'm April Duffy. I understand you have Jack Smurch staying here. - No, Ma'am. That's just a rumor. - Well, I suppose I should explain to you that I am Jack's fiancee. - You and about a hundred others. - You know, it's really quite a shame that he can't know I'm here, as I'm sure he would recover a lot more rapidly if he knew that I was on the premises. - Look, lady. There's nobody named Smurch at this hospital. - Thank you so much. You're a wonderful person. (upbeat jazzy music) - Exposure? Exhaustion? Convalescing for a whole week? Where is he? Why won't they let anybody see Smurch? - Perhaps he doesn't respond well to suggestions concerning his personal grooming. - Gentlemen, I don't believe that you appreciate the gravity of the situation. Just now, Smurch is resting quietly but, when the world, clamorous to lionize him, breaks down that sickroom door to haul him into the limelight, will that pitiless glare reveal a man mentally and morally equipped to cope with his own prodigious fame? - Mr. Smurch, these distinguished representatives of the nation's press have been selected to interview you. - Glad to see you. You guys can tell the whole cockeyed world that Jack Smurch put one over on that cream-puff, Lindbergh and made an ass out of them two Frogs. - Mr. Smurch, in his light-hearted way, refers to the gallant French aviators who just, last month, were tragically lost at sea. - Two less Frogs, that's bad? Anyway, it's just like them Frogs to go up there and get lost. Hey, maybe they had a date with Amelia Earhart. (laughing) - Mr. Smurch, there are accepted formulas for referring to distinguished persons and those of foreign nationality. - The hell with that, Mack. I flew that plane, not you. Ain't nobody done what I did. I got what it takes and I'm talking about it. - Mr. Smurch? What did you take along in the way of provisions? - Mr. Smurch took ham sandwiches on nutrient bread with several quarts of milk-- - Milk? I ain't interested in nothing brewed in no cow's belly. I took along a gallon of gin. Never would have made it without it. Also, a salami and two plugs of Slug brand tobacco. S-L-U-G. - What was it like, spanning the continents without once setting down? - Dull. Damn dull. I mean, what do you see? A field, a few waves, a few cities. Now, me? I like to look at a dame with big, healthy-- - Mr. Smurch? - And a nice, ripe-- - Mr. Smurch. - Which brings me-- listen, Mack. I'm supposed to be your guest. How come I don't get to go outside? How come no visitors? There ain't nothing wrong with fresh air and female company while I'm cured. You write that down. Hands off, Palooka. - In view of Jacky's condition, we have prepared for each of you, a press kit containing photographs, a biographical fact sheet and statements we may reasonably assume Smurch would have made had he not been suffering from stress and nervous exhaustion. Thank you for your co-operative patriotism. - "Modest Hero Shrugs Off Bold Exploit. "I fear my achievement has been somewhat "exaggerated, Jacky Smurch said today "from his hospital sickbed. "The conditions I enjoyed were as nothing "compared to the gallant French aviators "who tragically lost their lives last month." - Mr. Smidgeon, think of the press as an old mother. Think of America as the news-hungry infant she bottle-feeds. She knows the formula works. Why vary it and give the child indigestion? Perhaps we have retouched the facts a trifle, but given Jack Smurch, is that so bad? - Retouch is the right word for this photograph. You can't even recognize him. - Charity, Mr. Smidgeon, charity. We're giving him better than he deserves. - Herbert, I've had it up to here with this guff. I don't know how, but I'm gonna tell the world the real Jack Smurch story. (upbeat jazzy trumpet music) - "If you want to get out of here, "I'll be outside the back entrance tomorrow "from seven to midnight. "How you get there is up to you "and leave the rest to me. "A Friend." A friend? - Yes, Mr. Smurch? - Oh, Nurse. I haven't been sleeping so good lately. I think I'd like to see a priest, you know, get something off my chest. - I'm sure that could be arranged, Mr. Smurch. - Nurse? Make it a short priest. - A short one, is it? - Yeah. Tall priests, they don't know nothing. They got no relationship with God. (upbeat jazzy music) (screaming) - That way, Father O'Biskitt. - Bless you, my child. - It's just a godsend. Three nights, he paces up and down, miserable with insomnia, but after three minutes with Father O'Biskitt, he's sleeping like a baby. - Not a copper in sight. I'm sprung. So long, Flat-foots. Hey, Mister. I've seen you somewhere before. - I'm a reporter. I was there when you took off. That was me waving when you landed. - Wait a minute, Mack. I don't get it. What's in this for you? - I want to tell your story. - I don't need your help. I'll tell everybody myself. Hey, hey, good-looking. It's me, Jack Smurch. You want to go for a little stroll and hear my story? - Go home, Father. Try to get some rest. - That's not the way to tell your story. We'll hide out for a few days til I can get it all down. It will be the biggest scoop of all time. - Hey, Mack? You're looking at Jack Smurch. - You're Jack Smurch? - Yep. - I'm Woodrow Wilson. Pleased to meet you. - Get out of here. What am I wasting my time for? - Now you're talking. I thought you'd never come around. - From here on out, straight to Sweet Patootie. - I've got a car. I'll take you anywhere, but not now. They'll catch you again. Don't you always get caught? If you get caught this time, the truth may never come out. - You got a car? All right, I'll tell you the scoop, but just you. Nobody else, right? - Uh-huh. - All right, you ready? - Yep. - I had visions. You see, I got so hungry after I dropped my salami, you know what I saw? - What? - Stars. (grunting) (telephone ringing) - Yes? It's Smidgeon. You met Smurch at the service entrance? He punched you. He took the car and now you don't know where he is anymore. Hold on. Conklin wants to talk to you. - You're fired. - Herbert? He was on his way to April Duffy. - You think he's on his way to Canada, do you? Well, that remains to be seen. - If Smurch is seen riding that car, our goose is cooked. - You know, I've got a crazy notion that-- oh, I don't know why I stick my neck out. There are reporters getting fired around here for lending a helping hand. - Come on. What is it? - I've been around here all day. Anyone else would have asked for a bonus. It's time for this old, under-paid reporter to drag home his weary frame. - Out with it. If it's any good, it's worth a promotion. - Sweet Patootie. - Kott? Conklin here. Still wondering where Smurch is? He's driving a Journal-Herald car, license number-- - Patootie? Patootie. - Pal. Pal. (sirens wailing) - Patootie, Patootie. - Pal? - Hey, hey. (screaming) - You, tell them. Tell them. Jack Smurch was here. (sirens wailing) (bluesy jazz music) - And that is why, gentlemen of the Cabinet, in my opinion, Jack Smurch represents the most desperate crisis the United States of America has faced since the sinking of the Lusitania. (typewriter clacking) - Herbert? Listen. Can you help me get my job back? I'm broke and-- - Mr. Smidgeon, you're no reporter. Why don't you try some other line of work? (typewriter clacking) (men chattering quietly) - Hey, who's the big dead-head? - That's Mr. Charles K.L. Brand, aide to Secretary Kott. Mr. Brand was an All-American tackle at Rutgers. - Should have stayed like you were, Brand. You got flabby. They must have stuffed you in that suit. Hey, you ought to get his old helmet, keep the face hid. - Mr. Smurch, although we are aware that you are still suffering after-effects from your flight, we've put together a schedule of appearances for you with the co-operation of, among others, Governor Bannerman of New York. - Hi. - Lord Snowcourt, British Ambassador. To begin with, next Sunday, in Arlington Cemetery, you will place a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. On that solemn occasion, wearing a custom-tailored suit, you will deliver an address written for you by Mr. Cameron Spotswood of the American Embassy of Paris, who has generously offered to assist as vocal coach. Then, on Tuesday, you will address-- - I get you, I get you. You want me to act like that baby-face Lindbergh. Well, nuts to that, see? I ain't putting no pansies on nobody's grave, I ain't slobbering over no veterans and I sure as hell am not gonna kiss nobody on the cheeks. I want to get out of here to get what's coming to me. Now, when do the parties start, huh? Where are the broads? Where's the dough? You tell me that, now we got something to talk about. Geez, it's hot in here. - Gentlemen, the President of the United States. Mr. Smurch? The President of the United States. - How you coming, champ? Come on, come on. Let's get the hell out of here. It's stifling. Out of my way. I want some fresh air, Palooka. - [Newsboy] Smurch parade on Fifth Avenue. - Ha! You hear that? Smurch. Listen, listen. You think I'm gonna stick around here and learn my Ps and Qs and how to hold a fork? In a pig's eye. The hell with that, the hell with you. I'm gonna shove off and clear out of here. I've botched it up before and I can do it again. - He may have a point, you know. He escaped from reform school six times. - [Newsboy] Parade expected to draw huge crowds. Japan and Russia invite Smurch to visit. Read all about it. - Hot dog. I'm on my way, baby. - [Newsboy] Smurch parade expected to draw huge crowd. - Hot diggety dog. Hey, hey. Here I am, up here. Hey, I'm up here. Here I am, up here, raring to go. - [Newsboy] Read all about it. Smurch parade expected to draw huge crowds. (slow dramatic music) (triumphant orchestral music) - [Voiceover] A tragic accident has occurred. Jack Smurch is dead. The life of the heroic young aviator came to an abrupt end this afternoon. As he leaned out of the 12th story window, Smurch was overcome by vertigo and, before the horrified gaze of attendants, fell to his death. Tune into this station Monday at 11 a.m., for the funeral remarks of Secretary of State, Irwin Kott, broadcast from Arlington Cemetery. - We are gathered here today in solemn commemoration of the great and lasting achievement of Jack Smurch, for whose brief presence among us, we are profoundly grateful. This worthy representative of a generation, determined to subdue the brute forces of nature, incarnated anew the pioneer spirit which shines through every page of American history. Like Abraham Lincoln, Jack Smurch was a messenger of peace and goodwill, who, through deeds arising from sincere affection for all humanity, brought the great peoples of the world in closer communication. And so it is, that in the great memorial amphitheater of Arlington Cemetery, his on-rushing chariot of dauntless youth which flashed across uncharted heavens, is commemorated for all succeeding generations by this simple, unadorned monument, with the device of a tiny plane engraved upon the face, a token of the affection and esteem cherished in the hearts of his countrymen for Jack Smurch. At this time, we ask all Americans-- - Do me a favor, will you? Turn that off. - [Kott] To join us for two minutes of silent prayer in memory of Jack Smurch. (jaunty honky-tonk music)
