VOYAGE TO CYTHERA by, Theo Angelopoulos Alexandros! Keep your head down! Got you, Alexandros! Got you, Alexandros! Got you, Eleni! Got you, Alexandros! Got you, Eleni! Got you, Alexandros! Got you, Eleni! Got you, Alexandros! Got you, Eleni! Spyro! Spyro! Spyro! Spyro! Good morning. Madam asks if you want anything else. Spyro! It's me... It's me... It's me... It's me... It's me... It's me... It's me... It's me... It's me... It's me... Do I wait for your signal? It's me... Good morning. Good morning. I often discover, with horror and relief... that I no longer believe in anything... At such times, I turn back to my body... It's the only thing that reminds me I'm alive... Is that all? That's all. We only seem to meet at work, these days... Is it your wife? No. What am I to do with this? Much too big. Tell Giorgos to change it. A large coffee, black. Lavender? Lavender? Waiter Lemon tea, please... Will you pick me up at the theatre tonight? Alexandros! Always late... You haven't changed. This ship's coming in. We'll just make it. I called the committee... for the Repatriation of Civil War Exiles. I wanted to make sure he's coming. Do you remember what he looks like? I didn't know he played the violin. I expected him to be taller. Do you know something? He may be our father, but after 32 years... it doesn't mean much, does it? Why should we keep running after a shadow? It's me! I am Alexandros! And I am Voula. Nico couldn't come. He's abroad. Mother's waiting at home. At home? Aren't we going to kiss each other? Here we are. What's the matter? I'm afraid. She's waiting for you. What's the color of her eyes? Did you eat? Welcome home, Spyro! Thank you. You must be Elias' sister... That's right! And you must be... Costa's son! How are you, my boy? You can't expect him to remember... So many years ago. A lifetime. You must have lots of strange stories to tell. Russia is a big place. It snows a lot in the winter. Katerina! Voula, the soups's ready. Coming. Wine! Where's the wine? I'll bring it. Mother, what happened? Mother, open up! Mother. For God's sake... why? Spyro, where are you going? You've been here before, haven't you? The two of you? What did you tell her back home? What happened? I don't understand. She's lived with the dream of your return... Tomorrow we leave for the village, as you wanted. The Salonica express. Will you be all right here? I'll manage. Don't wait. Run along. Good night. Good night. That's the old outlaw code isn't it? You remember, Mother? As if I could forget. That's Panayotis. What are they saying? He's asking who's there. Hey, Argos! Hello there, Giorgos! Hello there, Leni! Hello there, Dimitri! They're coming. You know, Spyro? They haven't set foot here for 15 years. Life is easier down in the valley. They've come to sell out whatever's left. They'd sell the sky if they could. Forty red apples, my love, wrapped in a kerchief... Forty red apples, my love... wrapped in a kerchief... It's been several years but I never told you... Katerina... I like you Ever since we were young lads... Always... Forty red apples, my love... wrapped in a kerchief... Ah, Father! The women are waiting for you to open the house. A rotten apple... Strip off the newspapers. I'll light the fire. It's about the sale of our land. The village meadows on the hill are up for sale. Ours too. Mother wouldn't sell until you came back. They want to build a winter resort up there. It's not just the money. It'll liven up the place a bit. You know the law even better than I do. You've let your meadows lie fallow. Nothing but weeds and shrubs... And the boundaries are far from clear... However, the Company is willing to take the risk. You will sign the contract collectively... It'll be easier and quicker that way. Otherwise we'll never get to the end of it. Well, that's all from us, Mayor... Let's get on with the signatures before we freeze. I'll call the names by alphabetical order. Step over here when you hear your name called. You'll need your identity cards. Burduis, Evenkilos Present. Ibuserandis Present. Pallas, Antonis? Present. Do you know him? No, I don't. What does he think he's doing? Everybody's got to sign, or the deal is off. Mayor, you've been leading us on. You assured us they had all agreed to sell. You... you bastard... You come back so late You should be punished You've come to make trouble here again... Put away that shovel, you bastard... Bastard... I'm not going to let you... Bastard... Bastard... This slice is for the house... This is for the father... And this for Alexandros... For Voula... For our Nico, who is at sea... For our friend... For the stranger who may knock at our door... For the mother... Katerina! Katerina! If you don't sign, the deal is off! We'll be ruined. All these years you've been the boss in the family. And now he comes along pretending he cares for the land. We know all about him. He made himself a new life abroad... Excuse us, we're having our supper. Why won't you let mother sign? What right have you to refuse? Ever since I can remember, I never saw her laugh... She went to prison for your sake. A lifelong struggle, raising us kids... A wasted life... Voula... Her body dried up, waiting for you. You and your generation never gave other people a thought. You took to the mountains, fought and then went away. Why did you have to come back? What do you want those damn fields for? What use can they be to you now? I'll be on my way now... Spyro! You're dead... finished... You don't exist. It's the time you roamed the mountains with your gun. You're dead, Spyro! You are a dead man Four times condemned to death... at the court martial in Larissa... The newspaper's worn away in my pocket all these years. You can't play havoc with us again, Spyro. Be gone The first year barely goes by... you manage... Then the second year... the third. You've just got to hang on to something... At first, you think of Greece... all the things you left behind... But in the end, you get sick at heart. Then one day a woman comes along, cooks you a meal, sews on a button... And so... I've got three other children over there. What's she like... the other one? Spyro... They've all gone... We're the last ones left. Spyro. I'm staying. They made us fight each other... You on one side, me on the other... and we both came out losers. Man against man, wolf against wolf. All gone, all laid waste... The fusiliers, the fusiliers... My heart's with the fusiliers... If I have to die, let it be... With my rifle in my arms... Forty red apples, my love... What's bitten you? I've told you. I don't intend to spend my life running after ghosts. One victim in the family is quite enough. Nobody forced you to come. That's why I'm angry. Angry at myself. It's never too late. How right you are. HQ calling D2... Calling the search party... Request you inform us how the operation proceeds... Repeat This is the HQ Report the search operation Where is he? It's the wife. Where is he? He's disappeared. The search was on the moment the fire was reported. Was he there? Did you search the house? What do you mean? We nearly broke down the door. What's he saying? He's asking when are we going back home. Come out. It's only us: Katerina, your son... I'm not going. I'm staying here. This is my land. Tell them we've found him. The men can go back now. It's me. You haven't changed. You always go off on your own when you're afraid. Rotten apple (in Russian). He's in no state to give evidence. What should we do now? We should get him out of here. He's causing trouble. That's for him to decide. Don't forget he has no nationality. He is a displaced person. We don't want to get him in the trouble And you... Are you quite sure he's your father? Alright, you've convinced me. Besides, we've been up all night... Haven't had a bite for hours... I'm off... but remember we're holding you responsible... if anything goes wrong after I leave. Don't forget we can withdraw his permit any moment... Go and collect his things. I'm staying with him. I can hear perfectly well what you are saying, Tesman. How am I going to get through the evening out here? I'll be with you every evening We shall have a very pleasant time here you and I, Mrs. Tesman. That is what you are looking forward to, isn't it, Mr. Brack? You, as the only cock in the yard. She shot herself! Shot herself in the temple! One doesn't do that kind of thing! It's alright, I'll change by myself. Please leave. Don't go! Alexandros, we're going location-hunting. Here's the boat schedule for Cythera: The boat's name is NEREUS and it leaves every morning at 6. It stops at the following ports: Kyparissi, lerakas, Monemvassia, Neapolis, Elafonissos, Gytheion, Anticythera. It reaches Cythera in the late afternoon, at sunset. Scene 91 The villagers' angry shouts rose from the street below. The old woman looked back in despair. They're going to wreck everything, she said in a low voice. They hurried down the steps. The old woman locked the door and gave the old man the key. Banished-for the third time, he whispered. All these years, I waited... I'm so tired. You're hurting me. We'll go away... You'll see. Down in the harbor? At what time? You mean seven hours' walk? For God's sake! In this weather, too! Has he gone? No. When they got here, the Russian boat had left. Wait here Now they don't know what to do with him. Voula's gone to fetch a lawyer. Yes, I'll start as soon as I get your signal. I hear you... I hear you coming... I fooled you five times. Five wars... Then prison... The firing-squad... You are fooled I hear you... I hear you coming. I hear you Did you see them? The lawyer will be here in half an hour. Nescafe with milk. I'll mix it myself. If only he had signed those papers... we would have been spared all this trouble. He ended up by antagonizing everyone in the village. Nothing but trouble, everyday... till he was declared undesirable , a public threat. They've just issued an expulsion order. Alexandros They say we will embark... at the old harbor Hurry, the boat's leaving. Captain! This is Harbor Police You hear that The Russian passenger has arrived. Captain, this is Harbor Police The Russian passenger has arrived. You hear that Mr. Harbor Policeman, I heard that But before I allow the embarkment I have to make sure if this is his own will I'd like to hear his response in person Captain, now I'm asking him and he refuses to say anything He is only saying from time to time... Rotted apple, rotten apple... What? Rotted apple. I am not sure Rotted apple Excuse me... we feel so sorry that we can let him embark I'm sorry... Goodbye Captain, what about our deal Captain, we had a deal... Please She's got to lie down somewhere. No, not you. At four o'clock today, in the old harbor... the dockers are holding their annual feast. The programme includes many guest artists, the Municipal band... singers, conjurers, mimes... Come and join in the fun... at four o'clock in the old harbor... Isn't there a doctor around? It's Sunday, you see... The Feast of the Assumption... Twelve days and nights on the oxcart... Making cigarettes with tobacco leaves A drop of water, please, Father. He called my father Father. He gave me a tired look, I blushed. I was barely fourteen... He was like making a vow spreading the water little bit little and drank all the water in the bottle His Adam's apple moved up and down glistening with sweat. Where are you from, lad? A refugee from Lonia, Father... What should we do now? Where are you taking him? To international waters, till further orders. Coffee, black, please. What will you have, boys? Black coffee. Me too. Three coffees then. Am I the first? Did you bring him here? So you got wind of it already? We're waiting for further orders. Turn down the music I'm a journalist. What's your connection with him? Are you a relative? I'm the one who's responsible, goddamn it... My orders are clear: He must leave the country at all cost So what do I tell them now? Keep calm, keep cool. Officially speaking, he's no longer here. But he is here! Not on paper he isn't. At this moment he's traveling. At four o'clock this afternoon... in the old harbor... the dockers are holding their annual feast. The programme includes many guest artists... the Municipal band... singers, conjurers, mimes... Come and join in the fun. She's asleep. The mist is clearing. The rain's stopped. What do you want me to do? It's Sunday, everything's shut... and the orders are that he's out of the country by dawn. And leave him there all night? That's plain murder! I just don't know. I'm utterly confused. What am I to do? You suggested this solution. And you agreed! I hate to think of him out there in the rain... but there's no room for sentiment in the civil service. What if he's taken ill or something? I'm in charge of the dockers' feast. One ouzo, please. Why didn't you tell me? What is he doing now? He's looking out at sea. And now? He's still looking. Then he's all right. The feast will take place after all. I often discover with horror and relief that I believe in nothing. Then I return to my body. It's the only thing that reminds me I'm alive. A double brandy. One, two... one-two... Will the artists please step over... Testing... testing... One, two... one, two... Testing... testing... You can barely see him... The motor-launch is coming back I can see her lights. One, two... One, two... Oh God, I'm out of step... One, two, three... Night! Lights! One... Two... Three... Four... Five... The weather hasn't been very kind... But we've decided to have our feast anyway... if only symbolically... in honor of that old man out there at sea... So we'd like to ask his wife... to give us some remarks I want to go with him. I want to go with him. We're waiting for further orders... but if she insists... I want to go with him. Daybreak... I'm ready.
