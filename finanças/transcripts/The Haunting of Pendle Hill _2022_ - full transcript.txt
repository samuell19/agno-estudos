[film reel clattering] All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. [laughing] Is that enough? [soft orchestral music] Yeah. Can I keep this 'cause this is written well, which, I can frame this, couldn't I? Yeah, let's have it all again. [man chuckles] [film projector clattering] Hello Princess. [ominous music] [creepy whispering] [eerie vocalizing] Will thou not wait until the morning, my friend? T'would make me feel better. I'm afraid not, if I don't leave now, I won't make my engagement with Wakefield, and he is not a man who likes to be kept waiting. Very well, but let it go on record the offer was there. Take care, John Law, look after thy self. And you Roger, and of course Maude, that precious daughter of yours. You should be proud Roger, a most sterling job you have done since Elizabeth's passing. Thank you, John. But please, take heed. Do not stray from the path. Not at this hour. Evil lurks within in that there forest. [chuckles] Nothing more than tales. A tale? It is real, as God as my witness, I assure thee. As real as these walls, as real as you and I here now, as real as that storm we hear. A storm is coming, John Law. Take heed. [ominous music] [horses clopping] [chickens clucking] O God, our heavenly Father, whose glory fills the whole of creation and whose presence we feel wherever we go. [ethereal choral music] Preserve those who travel, surround them in your loving care, protect them from every danger and bring them in safety to their journey's end, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen. [horses clopping] [dogs barking] Goodnight, Father. [sighs] Sleep well, fair child of mine. [thunder rumbling] Did Mr. Law make way on his journey? He did. And so to sleep. How proud thy mother would be if she could see thee now. [bell tolling] [roosters crowing] [rain pattering] [lightning striking] [suspenseful music] [thunder rumbling] [creepy whispering] Hello? I say, who goes there? [intense music] What are you doing here, child? Are you lost? [tree creaking] Child? [creepy breathing] [John gasping] [John choking] [intense music] ["Ave Maria" by F. Schubert] [singing in foreign language] [train rumbling] [birds chirping] [ominous music] [soft dramatic music] [urine trickling] [branch snaps] [intense music] Hello? Are you lost? Are you okay? [eerie vocalizing] [phone ringing] Yeah? Oh, hey, Uncle Alfred. No, I was working late. Shit. Uncle Alfred, calm down. Yeah, okay, okay. Let me grab a shower and I'll head over. Okay? All right. Love you. See you soon. [soft dramatic music] [shower spraying] Matilda, your father is missing. Missing? When did you last speak to him? Probably last month, but you know, that's not unusual for him, especially when he's writing or following a lead. Unusual. What is it? Hey, don't get up. What is it? Over there. On the table. [soft classical music] That's the one, my dear. Is this what he was working on? The Haunting of Pendle Hill. Pendle? In England, uh... He was following the plight of one Roger Nowell, he was a magistrate, a Justice of the Peace, if you will, but, of course, he was also a witch hunter. How far back are we talking? 1612. Upon Pendle Hill stood Malkin Tower. This word, it appears several times, Dem- - Demdike. Malkin Tower was her home. Demdike, that's a- - Cunning woman, but of course also, she was a- - A witch. And Demdike was the most feared of them all. She would send her granddaughter, Jennet Device, into the woods to lure men back to the tower. And so this Richard Nowell- - Roger Nowell. He saw his role in the community as identifying non-conformists, anything from a witch to a Catholic and then bringing them to justice. Roger Nowell arrested Demdike, her daughter and her granddaughter, before burning Malkin Tower to the ground. And at the now infamous Pendle Witch Trials, Jennet claimed that her mother and grandmother were indeed witches. She turned on her own family? They were sentenced to death. What about Jennet? Jennet was sentenced with them. Her testimony wasn't enough to save her, the poor little thing, and then she vanished from all records. The history books do not remember her. - Where'd she go? - Legend has it she escaped. She ran back into the woods, but she strayed from the path and couldn't find her way home. And Demdike would forever haunt that forest, looking for her granddaughter and seeking vengeance for her own demise and that of her daughter. And Roger? Roger Nowell made it his life's mission to find Jennet Device. Your father was tracing Nowell's footsteps when he disappeared. Leaving that notebook behind? He has been a bit out of sorts recently. Are you sure he's missing? Oh, he's missing. I've reported it to the local police there, but they don't seem much interested in searching for him. Said that tourists go up there all the time. Disappear for days on end, weeks sometimes I want you to go find him. - Me? - I've booked you a flight tomorrow morning out of LAX. That's all taken care of. Now I made contact with a local guide there, Arthur. He'll take care of you. He'll take you onto the mountain. Uncle Alfred, are you really sure he's, 'cause I mean, it's not unusual. Matilda, there is one more thing you should know. [soft dramatic music] [Roger Voiceover] "Roger Nowell, Justice of the Peace. Good sir, I write to ask if one may perhaps have word of our friend John Law. He did not keep his appointment with me Tuesday last. 'Tis most out of character for him and a cause of great concern for me. Father. Maude, prepare thyself for we must embark on a journey of the gravest of importance. - What is it, pray tell? - Our good friend John Law did not reach his destination Tuesday last. The night of that storm. I fear greatly for him. Do you think it her? [bell tolling] - Jennet Device? - Yes, father. I do, child. I do. [chickens clucking] This must end, this haunting of Pendle Hill. But of what use can I be? Though are not safe if my suspicions are correct. And with me, indeed, I think you can be of great use. Now come, make haste, darling daughter. We must visit the chapel and pray with Father Grantham before we depart. [dog barking] [soft dramatic music] [birds chirping] [soft piano music] Hey. Matilda Richardson, I've got a room booked. [key scrapes] I'm looking for my father, he went missing up here, - have you seen him? - No. Room's up there, to the left. Uh, thanks. And if you're thinking of going up there to the forest, don't stray off the path. [suspenseful music] [door closes] [lock clicks] [Matilda sighs] [creepy whispering] [customers chattering] Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine. Welcome to Pendle, Matilda Richardson. - Arthur? - So they say. So what will you be having? - What's your poison? - What's that? - Irish champagne. - I'll pass. Can I get a whiskey, please? Neat. Now here comes to the decider. There are whiskeys and then there are whiskeys. Two redbreasts, double neat. "A Robin Redbreast in the cage puts all heaven in a rage." - William Blake? - Oh, not just a pretty face. You find me pretty? That's very forward. Well, I don't like to waste time. I like to get right down to it. - Down to it? - The nub of it. I can tell you're a friend of my uncle's. How's he doing? Is he still rocking those Hawaiian shirts? He's worried about my father. We both are really worried. I've been asking questions, obviously. The cops up here, they don't take this stuff seriously. If it's not one person, it's another. A lot of kids come up here and then there's those who are trying to find themselves. And then there's the others who are trying to find something else. - Something else? - In the darkness. - You believe in it? - The Haunting of Pendle Hill. "And if you gaze for long into an abyss- - The abyss gazes also into you." So, you're an LA girl, so you know how to hike. You obviously take care of yourself. Oh, I can take care of myself. And yet here I am. Here you are. I promised your uncle I would protect you. And that you'd find my father. I don't make promises I can't keep. And that's a promise I couldn't keep. I'll do my best, Matilda, but you need to be prepared for the worst. I'm sorry. We'll leave at first light. There are few things you need to see first. Oh, you need to get some rest. It pays to keep a clear head. Otherwise the mind, it can play tricks. Please, let me get these. I think I have some British pounds. Oh no, Princess. I've got this. - Anything wrong? - Just haven't heard - that in awhile. - A man buy a lady a drink? Being called Princess. Just something someone used to say. Someone I used to know. Never let a lady buy a drink, my dad taught me. So will you be stopping by at the Commercial? Yeah. Well, I will see you when you're older. - Thank you. - Sweet dreams. Good night. [ominous music] [birds chirping] [creepy whispering] What is it, Father? Can though feel it? Listen. I don't hear anything. Feel it. Jennet? Jennet? Show thyself! I know you're out there, Jennet! Show thyself! [creepy whispering] Show thyself! [Matilda breathes heavily] [soft dramatic music] [doorknob clattering] [Matilda breathes uneasily] [suspenseful music] [creepy whispering] [doorknob creaking] [creepy whispering continues] [doorknob clattering] Hello? [lock clicks] [Matilda sighs] [suspenseful music] [fingernails scraping] [Matilda gasps] Who's there? [creepy whispering] [fingers scraping and tapping] [Matilda breathes heavily] It's not real, it's not real, it's not real, it's not real, it's not real, it's not real, it's not real, it's not real, it's not real, it's not real, it's not real. [intense music] [Matilda breathes heavily] [suspenseful music] [wind whistling] [birds chirping] [water flowing] [suspenseful music] Father, look! No child, be careful. [creepy whispering] [horn blaring] [classical piano music] - Good morning, young lady. - Good morning. - Did you get any rest? - Not really, I... - Jet lag? - Something like that. What's first? Saint Mary's Church. It's tradition. A ritual, if you will, for those who venture into the woods in search of the darkness, first go there for a blessing from Father Michael. - I'm an atheist. - You're a millennial. No, I'm an atheist. - You don't believe in God? - I don't believe in God. Besides, you can't play God without being acquainted with the devil. Well, you don't have to believe in God, you just have to believe in tradition. And Father Michael was one of the last people to see your dad. [birds chirping] [phone buzzing] Will you excuse me? I need to take this. Especially if we're gonna be up in the mountain all day without service. - Shall I wait? - No, go on ahead. I'll, I'll be right there. [door opens and closes] [bright classical music] Hello? [suspenseful music] [ethereal choral music] - Matilda. - God! Well, not quite. I'm so sorry to have startled you. Dear girl, you look like you've seen a ghost. I'm sorry. I thought... Come, sit my child. [ethereal choral music] How old is this place? The original chapel was constructed in the 1500's. I think the heating and the pigeons were installed at the same time. And a few years back, it was faithfully restored for the tourists, but you're not a tourist here for a history lesson. How are you? You look awfully worried. I am, my father is missing. My uncle notified the cops, but... He came here to pray. There's so many before him and after. He seemed like you, a worried soul. Worried? Lost. But not all who wander are lost, my dear. He's missing! - Now don't, - My uncle notified the cops, don't get yourself worked up. Please, I just need to find him. You, you don't believe, do you? - [ethereal choral music] - In... In our father. No. What do you believe in? I believe in hope. Hope. Hope. What a marvelous thing. Because without hope, what have we got? Your father believed. He did? And let us pray for him. [Father Michael exhales] O God, our heavenly Father, whose glory fills the whole of creation, and whose presence we find wherever we go. [dramatic choral music] Preserve those who travel, surround them with your loving care, protect them from every danger, and bring them in safety to their journey's end, through Jesus Christ our Lord. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. [ethereal choral music continues] Arthur. Father Michael. [birds chirping] [doors close] Are you all right? [seatbelt clacks] I'm fine. Let's go. Okay. [ethereal music] Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. [ethereal choral music] May God rebuke him, we humbly pray. And do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen. [breathes uneasily] [suspenseful music] My God, it's beautiful. What is it? This was Malkin Tower. Demdike's house, home to her and her family, namely one Jennet Device. Roger Nowell, he burned it to the ground. I read it in my father's journal. He did. As Plotinus watched the great library burn, every story ever written reduced to ash. But those stories weren't gone, not really. They simply became new stories, a legend, one of the great fire itself. Perhaps as a historian, your father should have poised a question that no one else ever dared to ask. What's that? How did it ever come to pass that it was the witches we feared and not those who burned them alive? He would have been here. My father. Dad! You really have no idea how big this place is. Come on. We better get a move on. [doors close] [Arthur sighs] What is it? Matilda, look. You're tired, you're stressed, you've barely slept, your father is missing, and you're in a strange place. This place, if you see things, they're not real. It's your mind playing tricks. It happens to the best of us. Okay? Okey-dokey. Here we go. [engine starting] [ominous music] [door opens] The rest of the way, we'll go on foot. [glove compartment opens] What's that for? Trust me if, I don't save your life, these will. - Here, let me help you. - I can manage. - Okay, sorry. - No, I'm sorry. I'm just tired, like you said. [sighs] Okey-dokey. Lead the way. [suspenseful music] [creepy whispering] [birds chirping] What was that, Father? Did thou hear it? Nothing much, child. Probably just an animal. - Art thou sure? - Of course. Come now. Make haste. We have much land to cover yet. Yes, Father. Art thou okay? I'm growing tired, Father. Would thou care to rest for a while? Maybe. Of course, but for a moment. [birds chirping] [Maude sighs] I'm sorry, Father. Sorry for what? She wouldn't have tired, would she? Mother. Oh child, 'tis not the time for such solemn, sad thoughts. Why must it always be sad to speak of her? She was loved so very much, Father. Not just by myself, but by you too. I know it to be so. [soft dramatic music] Why don't you want to speak of her? Though tell me I am like her so, yet so rarely though speak of her. She brought such light, did she not? Sweet child. Oh Father, I'm sorry. I- - I know I doth say it a lot, but thou art like her so very much. Perhaps thou doth not realize it, but thou really are. Her courage, her bravery. I thou imagine capturing the brightest star of them all. And then... And then what? [soft dramatic music] And then darkness. Life is but a series of meetings and partings, Maude, that is the way of it. Now come child, 'tis time to rest. [soft dramatic music] [birds chirping] Why are we stopping? We'll set up camp here for the night. We just got here and now you wanna stop? You do not wanna go into that forest at night. - But- - No buts! You'll do as I say if you wanna survive. Survive? I wanna find my dad. And that's exactly what we'll do at daybreak, but now it's nearly dark and I'm telling you, you do not wanna go into those woods at night. [suspenseful music] What are those? To keep what's inside, inside. Who put them there? Those who believe. In what? The Haunting of Pendle hill. Belief to the believer. Is true, and as you say, one can't play God without being acquainted with the devil. In hell, there is no greater punishment than to begin over and over again the tasks left unfinished in this life. What? Tasks. [chuckles] Ladies' choice, do you wanna build the tent or the fire? [suspenseful music] [fire crackling] Don't be afraid, Maude. - I'm not. - Good girl. Pray tell, what is your plan, Father? Demdike was the most feared witch of them all, but as she aged, she feared she was losing her powers until the birth of her granddaughter Jennet. At night, she would send Jennet into the woods - wearing a mask. - A mask? A costume, a disguise most cunning, - that of a cat. - Hmm, a cat? Aye, that of a cat. T'was to appear most innocent so when a peddler would would cross her path, this very path in this here forest, they would be fooled. Is that why you arrested them? Yes, 'twas Good Friday and they all should have been in church with Father Grantham. But alas, they were gathered at Malkin Tower, all plotting to take the life of a man, Maude. Evil, evil... And that evil still exists in these woods, ever since Jennet escaped her imprisonment. She's out here? 'Tis not possible for such a young girl to survive without shelter and food for so long. - She died? - As well she should have done! Had she not died out here in this darkness, she would have by my hand upon Gallows Hill. But alas, she now haunts these woods, as does Demdike. What do they want, Father? Jennet was wracked with guilt for having testified against her own family, so every night, it is my belief she haunts these woods in search of more victims, for Demdike, to appease her, sacrifices to maketh amends for her sins against her family. And what of Demdike? A wicked, unforgiving woman, without soul or conscience, her heart as black as the night sky above. Her spirit too lurks in the darkest corners of this forest, and will not rest until it finds Jennet. And only then will this haunting, this madness end. And as god as my witness, it will end. [suspenseful music] Come child, it is time to rest. Huh? I said, it's time for you to get some rest. It's gonna be light again in a few hours and you need some sleep. Remember, it pays to keep a clear head. We can't stay up all night making S'mores. Yeah, you're probably right. Nightcap? [chuckles] Sure. Cheers. Cheers. [fire crackling] To your dad. To my dad. And mom, Beth. - What happened to- - She died. Hmm. I'm sorry. It's fine. Don't do that. Don't pretend. No one knew her like I did. Dad didn't even notice her when she was there, so it barely made a difference to him. Always had his head stuck in his books or out there. [scoffs] Places like out here, living in the past, didn't even see the present all around him, what he had. Again, I'm, I'm sorry. Don't. - Don't what? - Don't say it if you don't mean it. It's okay if you don't mean it. You didn't know her. It's just what everyone says, isn't it? I mean, just what you say. It felt appropriate. No one ever tells you, do they? Tells you what? No one ever tells you that grief feels so much like fear. To see the world in a grain of sand and heaven in a wild flower, to hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour. [suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] [Matilda gasps] [Matilda sighs] Arthur? Arthur? Arthur? [intense music] [Matilda screams] Arthur? Arthur! Arthur! [creepy whispering] Arthur! [creepy whispering continues] [intense music] [gun fires] It's okay. Hey, the most important thing you need to realize right now is you're not in trouble. You're all right. - And you're safe. - He's dead. Isn't he? Arthur... He is. Yes, Miss Richardson. Matilda. I'm sorry? Matilda. What happens now? Forensics are up there now. It's quite a hike you two took. They're securing the scene. We're waiting on dogs and a couple of extra men to look for the gun and, uh, they'll move the body - as soon as- - Please, please don't leave him up there alone. It's okay. He's not alone. - You promise? - I promise. Now let's worry about you for the moment, yeah? Are you sure you don't need to get a hospital? You, you could be suffering from shock. No, no, no. I wanna go back to my hotel. And that brings me to my next question. You're staying at the Commercial Inn? Yeah, yeah, that's right. Okay, well I just have to ask that you don't leave the country for the next few days. That's fine. My flight isn't till Sunday. Okay. Can I give you a ride back? Someone will come and tow the car Actually, would you mind if I drove it back? I have the keys right here. Are you sure you're feeling up to it? Yeah, really, I'm... - The Commercial Inn? - Yeah, yeah. Well I'll lead the way and you follow me. I've gotta make sure you get back there okay. And there will likely be a couple of more officers stop by and ask you some more questions tomorrow morning. Sure. That sounds good. And if you need anything in the meantime, or have any trouble with them, here's my card. It's, uh, PC Webster. You can get ahold of me on that number anytime. [sighs] Okay Missy. Let's get you into the warm. [suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] [soft dramatic music] [crickets chirping] Maude? Maude? Sweet child, where art thou, Maude? Maude? Where art though child? Maude? Maude? [suspenseful music] Where art thou? Child, sweet child, where art thou? Maude? Maude? Maude, please Maude! Come here child! Maude! Where art thou? Child? Please! Maude, where art thou? Sweet child? Maude? Maude? Maude? Maude? Jennet. Jennet, show thy self! Jennet? Jennet, show thy self! [flies buzzing] [birds chirping] Jennet? Jennet, show thy self! Jennet, show thy self! [suspenseful music continues] [creepy whispering] [creepy whispering continues] [knocking on door] [creepy snarling] [eerie music] [knocking continues] [knocking continues] Good morning, Miss Richardson. [sighs] Looks like you've been having a bit of a time of it. I'm sorry to have to knock, the, uh, front desk - have called up a few times. - I unplugged the phone. - I, I couldn't- - Yeah, no, of course. - Have you been drinking? - I watched a man blow his brains out. Of course I've been drinking. Yeah, yeah, right. Sorry, what is it you actually want? Would you mind if we have a quick chat? Just need to ask a few more questions. [suspenseful music] Last night, you said something about a young girl. I saw a young girl in a mask. - A mask? - A cat mask. A young girl and a cat mask. [sighs] It's just, we didn't find evidence - of anybody else up there. - So you look for her - and not my father? - No. [sighs] When a young girl goes missing- - Did someone report a child missing? - No, but- - But we reported my father missing three weeks ago. [sighs] I believe my Sargent already spoke to your uncle, Alfred, isn't it? [sighs] We just don't have the man power. You've seen the size of that mountain, that forest goes on for miles, parts of it completely unexplored, others unreachable on foot. [sighs] People go missing up there all the time, - and a lot of them choose to. - [scoffS] My father didn't choose to go missing, he's a respected historian, he was following the trail - of Roger Nowell for a book - Control to PC Webster. - and most importantly, - are you free to attend - he's not... - to a disturbance - at the station, over? - Just hold that thought. [receiver beeps] Yeah, received. Yeah, this is Webster. Show, show me as responding, over. Look, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go. I'll check on you tomorrow and see how you're doing, okay? [sighs] And once again, Miss, I am very sorry for your loss. We've made contact with the family and they are aware. [soft dramatic music] Who goes there? Identify thyself. I am Roger Nowell, Justice of the Peace, Magistrate of Pendle. [creepy whispering] I say, show thyself! [Demdike] One's mind carves a fairy tale when thou can't accept the harsh realities of the real world. Up here in the muck, scavenging and grasping for hope. There is no hope up here! Only despair. Demdike. Pray tell, where is she? My sweet child? Maude! [Demdike] Though stayed here to be with your child. She will belong to the hill now. What doth thou mean? [Demdike] The forest shall claim her like it claimed my home thou burned to the ground. Tell me now, what have thou done with her? [Demdike] Do you think thee a good man? I know the difference between right and wrong, - good and evil. - Would you like to see it? - See what? - True evil. Come closer. Demdike? [Demdike laughs] [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [creepy whispering] [intense music] [rope flutters] [Roger groaning] Dad? Dad, it's me, Matilda! Argh! Argh! Argh! [Roger groaning] Maude? Maude? Maude? Argh! Ma... Ma... Matilda? Matilda? Argh! Maude? Maude? Sweet child! [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] Maude? Argh! Maude. [Roger groans] [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] Dad, it's me, Matilda. Dad! Dad, are you there? Dad! Dad, it's me! Dad! Dad, where are you? Dad, it's Matilda! Dad! Dad, can you hear me? Dad! [suspenseful music continues] Dad? Dad, where are you? Dad, it's me! Dad, it's me, Matilda! Dad? [leaves rustling] [creepy whispering] Dad? [suspenseful music] Dad! [creepy whispering] Hello? Jennet. Jennet? Jennet? Are you lost? Are you lost? I think I might be. Can you help me? [suspenseful music] [creepy whispering] [Jennet screams] [intense music] [creepy whispering continues] [Matilda panting] [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] Dad! Dad! Dad, where are you? There's one more thing you must know. [soft dramatic music] Your father isn't well, Matilda. He is suffering from early onset dementia. Ah, he didn't wanna tell you. He certainly wouldn't want you to find out like this. You must find him before he loses himself forever. [soft dramatic music continues] Dad! - Matilda! - Dad, keep shouting! Matilda! Dad, come towards the sound of my voice! Dad, I'm coming, keep shouting! Matilda, you found me! [Matilda breathes heavily] I feel like I've been out here forever! How long have I been out here? I'd have waited forever to find out, you're my dad. But, but I don't have forever, do I? There's only now. But I'm here now, aren't I? Listen to me, hey, look at me. You're okay, you're okay. I'm here. I'm here now. Come on, we've got to get you out of here. I'm gonna go up there, to just get a bit higher and then I'm gonna come back for you? Okay? Okay. Okay. I'll be back, come on, get this around you, you're freezing. We've gotta keep you warm until help comes. I'll be back, okay? [soft dramatic music] Trust me, if I don't save your life, these will. [flare sizzling] [flare sizzling] [flare sizzling] [gun fires] [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [flare sizzling] [Matilda gasping] [Demdike] Roger Nowell. Demdike. I'd have waited forever to find you, you're my dad. But I don't have forever, do I? [Demdike snarls creepily] [Demdike laughs and hisses] "Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray. And do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen."
