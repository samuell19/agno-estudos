'COVID-19 has caused chaos throughout the world.' 'The world is trying to emerge from this pandemic when a new rumour is rife.' 'A more deadly virus has begun to spread on the border of India and China.' 'China has denied all claims' 'and their secret agency MSS ' 'is trying their best to keep this news from the world.' 'Against the constraints of time, our undercover agent Biren Ghosh' 'has managed to establish communication with a Chinese source.' 'And he's prepared to show evidence at the conference being held In London,' 'exactly seven days from now.' Are you okay? Has Ruhi returned from school? No, it's nothing. Just checking. I've to go to meet Uma. To plan the exhibition. Then straight home from there. Yes... No, I am listening. Sorry. I've a weird feeling. Like someone's watching me. Listen, if my phone's unreachable then call Uma. Listen. Trust only Uma. No. No need to worry. It just feeling. I'm hanging up now. Bye. Love you. Tell us who is your contact in the Chinese Delegation. Who else in your RAW unit knows about this? Hold on, we can't leave any traces. We're not doing that. Come on, this birdy needs to sing! Sing!! - Did you find anything? - No. The confrence is just a few days away. Any progress in Beijing? Nothing yet. Which one of you is betraying us? We need to fish out other RAW agents. before the delegation arrives. It's too dangerous. She is here as a diplomat. INDIAN EMBASSY LONDON We chose this room in the gallery for the exhibition. Indian Embassy's quite particular about the style that you... How long have you been working for the Indian Embassy? Three-years. Why? Your last exhibition with Biren Ghosh was very-very good. Did I say something wrong? No, it's nothing. Thank you. Actually, I've complete faith in your taste. So you can... Excuse me. Hello. I'll call you back in a while. What happened? What are you looking at? Nothing. I was just waiting for you to come off the phone. Did you deal with the artist's Visas? We're working on it. What do you mean? We're preparing for the 9th Global Conference on Virology. Mrs. Das has said that's priority. I know that. But what are you and Azad been doing? Everyone's arrived except for three others. But don't worry they will be here too. The best scientists in the country are attending. No delays. I understand, ma'am. The country's reputation is at stake. And also don't forget to speak about the party to the Delegation's coordinator. Ma'am, I've covered everything. It's all set. I even had a word with the classical singers. Thank you. Can I talk to you privately for a second? If you can tell the head office for my raise... Okay. If you can tell the head office for my salary raise, then that would be great. Can I come in? I've already requested for that. I know, but it's been a while, and I am under a lot of financial pressure. - If you could... - Ma'am, no one's following up with the British Embassy about fast-forwarding Indian artist's visas. Because we've only two people working on the conference. Azad, thank you. Close the door on your way out. But this exhibition is important too. You worry too much. Come, sit. How is the baby? Everything is fine. How is Sharad? He's good. Any lead on Biren Ghosh? Not yet. That's not good. Especially with this conference coming up. I'll find him. I know you two are friends. Keep me posted. Goel wants to talk to you. He sounds stressed. I am on my way. Any lead on Biren's last location? Vauxhall Bus Station. But his phone's been switched off for 24-hours. You think it's the Chinese? MSS is under a lot of pressure. But we need proof. London is a city of CCTV. Access all the footage and find out where Biren's been in the past few days. We're scanning the CCTV feeds. We'll find him soon. Great. How did they find out? 6 DAYS TO THE CONFRENCE We have to reduce supply. Why? There is no demand. Your money is sinking. Stop worrying about that and do your job. If this was my shop, I would be running it separately. The only difference being you wore born with a silver spoon and me in poverty. So this isn't your shop? Can I ask you a question? Do you trust me with Biren? I checked your mail. And Mrs. Mehta as well. Sorry. It's okay. Shopkeepers like us are not allowed to get emotional. I wonder where she is hiding. Biren was also a friend. Only Biren knew about the whistleblower. We've no contact whatsoever with the whistleblower anymore. The conference is in a few days. That's why the boss is restless as well. Let's go take a look. You carry on, I'll join you. Hello, sir. How are you doing, Uma? Are you taking care of yourself? Yes, sir. Thank you. Good. Now what I want to know is about Biren's sudden disappearance. How did his cover get blown? I don't know yet. He was heading towards my home but never made it. He was going to tell me about his source. So Biren's the only one who knows about our Chinese source? Any leads? He didn't send any SOS either. I tried tracing his last known location. The phone is dead. Dammit. Sir, we'll trace him. But until then what feedback do you want me to give our bosses? That the Indian Intelligence is not intelligent enough to find their own spy! Sir, I think we've a mole in our ranks. What are you saying, Uma? One needs evidence to make such claims. I have a strong feeling, sir. Your job doesn't function solely on instincts. Having said that we can't take any risks. Okay, look into it. But be careful. Where is Arjun? - Hello, sir. - Arjun. Okay, look, if the Chinese found out about our source then they will definitely kill him. Then this virus will level every city it spreads to. Just find Biren! We'll find him, sir. The situation is pretty stressed at the border, Uma. We'll all have to be extremely careful. The slightest mistake and India-China could go to war. Don't do anything to prove our involvement in any of this. If anything goes wrong in UK and MI6 will get directly involved. So...make no noise. No guns, no fireworks, nothing flashy. Keep it down. Keep it confidential. Keep me posted. I can feel it. Something doesn't fit. The store above and the one below both run on feelings. Shut up, Arjun. Let's get back to work. Okay. One missing RAW agent. Another deadly virus. And now we've a mole among us. Where do we start? Got the CCTV. He's an MSS Agent. Don't forget to come to the delegation party. I can't think about the party right now. Biren will come back. We're looking in all the hospitals. You won't find him in hospitals, Niru. He's been kidnapped. What? MSS is involved. MSS in London. I don't understand. What is this? Evidence of MSS's involvement. He doesn't have too long, Niru. We have to help him. I won't let them get away. Thank you. BIREN'S RESIDENCE Ruhi didn't even want to go to school. Biren's never done this. He's never ever been an hour late without informing in prior. When did you two talk for the last time? He called me after leaving from work. He was on his way to see you. Did he leave a message for me on the phone? No, but... He brought something for you yesterday. It's a painting. He trusted you a lot. Don't worry. I will find him. That summer in Beijing was the worst. Every day I used to wake up with a different problem. Each time worse than before. - Was Tara with you at that time? - Yes. I remember your wedding in Bali. You served Chinese food, but there was nothing Chinese in that. Our country is a huge melting pot. But we also know how to fight for the safety of our interest. What is it that you're actually implying, Ambassador. Where is Biren Ghosh? Who? The art collector. I've no idea what you're talking about. What's that? Evidence of MSS involvement. Would you like some more wine? No, thank you. Yes, please. I've heard times one Chinese does a crime you'll blame us. You can't take this seriously. There is going to be more evidence coming up. I mean it for your own credibility and that of China, Release Biren now. I mean it as a friend. With the Global Convention so close all ayes are on us. I can not have any dirt flung at us right now! Do you understand? Calm down. I'll manage this. If they get to the source before us there will be a huge misunderstanding. This kind of misunderstanding. will lead to war between both countries. UMA'S RESIDENCE The weather is pretty nice today. I really missed you. I wish you were here. By the way, you're glowing so much. In fact, I had to reduce the brightness of my iPad because of your glow. Anyway, did you think about ultrasound? Uma. Look, what you're doing is more important, so finish that first. - I'll call you later, okay. - No, listen. Honestly, I don't want to find out whether it's a girl or a boy. Why? Imagine if it's a girl like you always wanted. And what if it's not? Let's drop this topic. When are you coming back? Baby, I am trying to make a conversation. Please, be with me. Okay, okay, I am with you. Go on. It's come to this that to grab my wife's attention I'll have to talk in code. Right? I haven't decided on a date yet. Baby, let's talk tomorrow. Okay, fine. Do call me. Biren, why did you give me this painting? 5 DAYS TO THE CONFRENCE Hi. You drove in. Yeah. But don't worry, I made sure no one was following me. I trust you. Are you okay, Uma? Have you been crying? Biren is dead. What? They pulled his body out... They pulled his body out of Thames last night. Oh no! Nirupama and Wong met at the restaurant yesterday. He didn't like her claims. I think they released his body after Niru showed them evidence. That's him. Don't worry, I'll find him. You're in a very dangerous place, Yuki. You've to be careful of every step that you take. Always. What about our source? Only Biren knew of him. He didn't even risk telling me. You should not give up. Never! I owe that to him! You take care. If Biren ran the virus intel through Goel then it definitely went through embassy channels. There couldn't be another way. So the mole could be among us or in the Indian Embassy. Even Biren's immigration paper works were urgently processed. And Jeevan and Azad processed those papers. - All done? - Come on, let's go. Sir. Jeevan Bhati. Hails from Udaypur. Lives with his wife and daughter here. This is his third posting. Before this, he was in Buenos Aires and Nairobi. We must follow them. Places they go, things they do... What they eat, drink everything. - But first India... - I already checked India. Check their backgrounds as well. Jeevan's sitting with a friend. He looks Indian but can't confirm. 'I checked the data you sent in the database.' 'His name is Nishant Singh.' 'He's doing his PhD in Kings College in Chinese history.' 'But what is the connection between Jeevan and him?' But still. We'll have to be aware at all times. You're absolutely right. COVID has taught us a lot. Hi, Uma. All good? After the news of Biren's death... I know. I warned Wong. Do they really believe they can kidnap an Indian under broad daylight and kill him? Niru, I had to speak to you. I think there's a Chinese informant in our Embassy - and I've started investigating. - Meaning? Meaning I can't get into details right now, but this is important. I hope you understand. This should be thoroughly investigated. If you need any support, then tell me immediately. Thank you. D-Day's coming closer. Is everything alright between you two? Some relationships don't come with an expiry date? Did you decide whether you're going to deliver it here or India? I haven't decided that yet. The child is due in a couple of months, and you haven't decided yet. Can I get you something to drink? Thank you. I'll help myself. Okay. You know when I was pregnant with Ishaan I stole food from the Finance Minister's table. No wonder Ishaan was born such a healthy boy. I always carry my fuel with me. Forget it. They are serving Gouloti Kebabs today. Try them. I loved the food prepared by you the most. I've a great recipe. I'll forward it to you. You should try it. You must follow her. Excellent. 'Post the party Jeevan came straight to Mayfair.' 'Met Nishant and they left together in a cab.' 'Two meetings in a single day.' 'I'll keep an eye on them.' So how was the party? Was it good? It was great. But what's even better... Thank you. Thank you so much. I just did my job. But I just did it quickly. For you. Late on your first day. 'I have tracked the MSS Agent from the hotel.' 'He went to Tai Chi class near Old Street.' 'Keep a low profile and report anything suspicious.' 4 DAYS TO THE CONFRENCE Did you study Biren's report, Uma? I am just doing that, sir. We just decrypted the last message on his cloud backup. It's a flight number. SN 2903. The source is arriving in London in four days. On the day of the functions. Maybe the source is a part of the delegation. Sir, he won't reveal his intel until he isn't assured of his safety. Exactly. Make sure there are no leaks. If there's a mole and he finds out then our source will be compromised. I know, sir. This is a high priority. There is no room for any mistake. I know. I am trying my best, sir. Don't try, Uma. You must find the source at any cost. Did you investigate the Embassy staff? Yes. We haven't achieved any results yet. Just don't blow your cover. Keep me posted. Yes, sir. Pause. Pause. Pause. What did he give Nishant? Envelope. Even after all these years, you don't know how to operate the camera? What's the problem with this one? Nothing is visible. - Did you want their closeup? - Yeah. Cut it both of you. Check Nishant's background. Did you find anything from Jeevan and Azad's data? Jeevan is clean by Azad is hiding something. What? He's protected his personal folder with 256-bit encryption. I'll follow Azad. Can I get you something to drink? We've another suspect. Sharad Datta. The ambassador husband! What? Do we have permission for this? We'll have to do it under the radar. It's a bit risky, but it's necessary. Instinct. He's hiding something. I am sure. Azad Nair. Born in Kochi, raised in Kolkata. London is his 5th posting. Before this, he's been to Beirut, Islamabad, Kabul, and Beijing. Punishment postings one after another. His family? He lives alone in London. He got divorced last years. Wife got custody of the kids. He's at a cloth store. It's just a front for money laundering. He's sending a lot of money. - Where are you, boss? - Nishant's home. [indistinct chatter] One vodka. One vodka please. Hello, boss, where are you? I just left Nishant's home. And you. You wouldn't want to know. By the sound of music seems like you're in some bar. - Strip club. - Really. Do you like to watch only girls or also boys? If you don't love me, then at least think about your family. It's not what you think. I know you're meeting someone else. Sneha. Control yourself. What's the matter? You must come with me right now. No. I am busy. Emergency! Shall we? How long have you known Nishant? That's my personal matter. Your relationship with the enemy's spy cannot be your personal matter. And what if your wife and kids find out about this personal matter? Are you blackmailing me? No. I just want to know what information you gave him? It's a matter of National Security. Your sexual choices are of no importance to me. Please don't harm him. Nishant escaped from his flat today. Where is he? I don't know. Look, I am very irritated at the moment and short of time. So please don't test my patience. I didn't leak any information to him. What did you give him in the envelope last night? I just got his new passport made. He's gay. He didn't want to go back. I just helped him out. Are you taking advantage of him in-exchange of this help? I love him. I didn't tell him anything. Please, don't tell my family. Hey... F**k! Call security! Let's go. Let's f**k off from here. What are you wearing? She's sleeping. Don't worry. Look, I'll make it up to you. And I'll make it down to you. Quite an early morning conversation? Aren't you getting late? Don't ignore me, Sharad. Is she that student of yours? What do you think? I don't know what you've been up to for the past two weeks. Your affair... I know. I am the husband of the Indian Ambassador. Don't put it like that. Don't make it so obvious. It hurts. Did you forget your Beijing affair? Why do you keep digging up the past? Some wounds become worse with time. Can't we move on? I would really like to. But the Niru I loved my Niru got lost somewhere in Beijing. I've already apologised once, Sharad. It's not about the affairs. But you completely changed after that. You've become a totally different person. And I am still paying for that. So keeping all that in mind we come back to... As I was earlier saying the earliest composition in Sanskrit was the Rigveda. Even in that time Sanskrit was a language the elite. So my point is that language itself is a limiting form of communication. However, there is something special that language does when it changes form. Can you tell me what that is? Poetry. Poetry, thank you. Anjali. And next time we're going to discuss the greatest Sanskrit poem ever written. It's called 'Avigyan Shakuntalam' written by Kalidas. Anyway, thanks for coming and I'll see you next time. Any questions? What about romantic ballads? Were the being written in Sanskrit or Pali? - So...are you going to tell me now or.. - what? Mr. Nair. What? Would you like to come with me? Why? Whose payroll are you? What? What is your salary? 2000 pounds. And how did you send 10,400 pounds through money laundering? I won it in poker. How much do you spend on girls? Don't you have any shame? You work at the Indian Embassy. I do my work with honestly. Believe me. Then why is your computer encrypted? It's a personal folder. You can check it if you want. We'll do that. I started playing poker this year. When my parents came down with a viral they spent their life's saving in hospital bills. I couldn't have supported them with just my salary. So I started online gambling. And now you're addicted to it. If I don't send money to my wife post our divorce she doesn't let me meet my daughter. And even that guy Nishant is clean. As soon as his papers were processed he moved to Amsterdam with his real boyfriend. My hand's fractured. Send these pictures of Sharad and his girlfriend to Yuki. I don't understand how they came after me? Slowly they are following all of us. That's fine. They shouldn't be ahead of us. Even I don't understand. There were only two people who processed's Biren's papers in the Embassy. Jeevan and Azad. If both of them are innocent, then who is the mole? Hi. How is the investigation coming along? It's all a dead end. What happened? Jeevan committed suicide today. What? His body was found near the Wembly train tracks. I had called him for the investigation. I am coming from his home now. His wife and daughter? We're preparing to send them back to India today. He was one of my best. Are you sure it was suicide? There was a note in his pocket. I read that note with the Police's permission. What was written in it? He's blamed you for harassment, Uma. I can see that you know the art form already. It was many years ago. What province are you from? Xizang. (Tibet) Good morning, Anjali. What's tha plan? Uma, the girl Sharad is having an affair with she came to Tai-Chi today. What? They are up to something. 'Chang and Anjali together mean' 'they want something from Sharad.' 'Something doesn't fit.' A straightforward honeytrap. He's been travelling from one country to another with Niru for 10 years. He knows what a honeytrap is. In a honey trap, a man doesn't think from his brain but someplace else. And by the time he realises this he's already missed the bus. Let's see how valid your theory is. Time to find out. Sharad just left home and going somewhere. I will inform Arjun. Let's go get Sharad. Sharad didn't just start cheating suddenly. All these relationships are very complicated. Everyone's alone out here. Shattered on the inside. You're beginning to sympathise with the suspect. Here's a question. Why did you ever get married? This is not the time for such questions. Tell me. Cards were printed... And the bride ran out on you. No! I did. Why? I never got that far. You couldn't make it to your own wedding? No. I couldn't get that far in that relationship where I could take her responsibility. How far back is this? Myanmar. After the Met Syndicate assignment. After I returned I realised that this wedding will ruin her life. You know, sometimes even I think whether I ruined Tanmay's life by marrying him? Uma, you've ruined many lives. Did you get this cheap sense of humour in Myanmar. This cheap sense of humour is what makes Tanmay envy. You'll drop me home, nah! Yes, madam. And then to Sharad. F**k! F**k! We could have saved him, Uma. I can't believe they went so far. Don't blame yourself, Arjun. We can't compromise our cover. I don't know, Uma. Are we doing the right thing or not. I am really-really sorry, Niru. I don't know what's happening. We'll find them. Sharad won't come back. It's all my fault. No, Niru. Please don't blame yourself. If you have any information then please tell me. I knew he was having an affair. I should have tried harder. But why did she kill Sharad. That woman is working for the MSS. Did you know about his affair... We were tracking him. I've a question. Did Sharad know any of your passwords? He was never interested in my work. He was innocent. He was innocent. Can we talk? One minute. You can do this later. I am trying to work. Yuki's intel confirmed that Chang is behind Angelie. But why kill Sharad? As the date of the conference is drawing closer they are growing nervous. That's why Sharad died. But why Sharad? He knew nothing. Or did he? Maybe they told Sharad to get some confidential information from Nirupa. And Sharad resisted. And maybe Yuki is a double agent. She's misleading us on Chang's instructions. No. That's not possible. Think, Uma. How did she trace Chang so easily? I know Yuki and her entire family very well. There's no way she is a double agent. That's the problem with you, Uma. Your trust is blinding you. Don't you trust me, Arjun? Or is it your strategy to always undermine me? You didn't learn anything? I thought you were special... But you really disappointed me. Tai Chi teaches you to move with the world. I'll give you a minute to decide which side of the world you are on F**k! What happened? That's Yuki. What? These people are very desperate right now. They can do anything. They will make her spill everything. No. She doesn't know anything. What are you saying, Uma? She works for us. You've met so many times with her. - About Biren... - She doesn't know anything about Biren. I am coming. I am coming. How many more people have to die, Uma? This is a bloody unmitigated disaster! All the channels are talking about Sharad and Nirupama! What's going on under your watch? - Sir... - You couldn't find the mole or the source! I should've transferred you back to Delhi after the Istanbul disaster! But no! I gave you a second chance, and this is what I get. Hello, sir. No need to dip up old graves. Istanbul is 3056 kilometres away. Let it stay that way. Pack your things, Uma. You're coming back home. Arjun will take charge of the unit. I'll prepare for the handover. Since when did you start listening to your seniors? Finally, this is your store now. So whether you turn it into a massage parlour or strip club none of my business. Let's get back to work. One thing, when Dave and Chang tracked you down did you call or text anyone? Just Uma. All the other communication was over the Comms. How did Dave and Chang find out? And they found Yuki after I texted her. Biren wanted to send this painting to me. He was sending me a message. There must be some information about the source in it. What could be better cover for an art collector than this? This is what you wanted to ask Yuki, didn't you? No one knew that I sent a text to Yuki. M, check my phone. Your phone is bugged. What? How did I not see this coming? This bug has mirrored your phone. It will send information about any calls and texts you make to its source. Don't remove this bug. They shouldn't know that we know. We'll only communicate over comms now. And we'll have to leave this office as well. Okay. Let's get going. Day of the Conference. Delegates from all over the country have arrived. We don't know about the source or the mole. All we know is that the MSS and their mole don't know this information either. We have only one chance. We must get to the source first and take him to the Indian Embassy. Uma, the source is someone from the Chinese Delegation. But do we even have a mole? What? Maybe they got the information from your phone? I never talked or texted Biren from my phone. When did they put this bug? I don't know. But we must find the source now. Who could it be among these eight people? What's this going on between you two. "Where the river and the sun meet." "Meet me there." "Where the river and the sun meet." "Meet me there." There's nothing here. "Where time began." "Where time began." "Time began." Beginning of Kaal (Time). Where Kaal began. Where Kaal began. Meet me where 'Kaal' began. Listen, this is our last chance. The source was going to meet Biren in a gallery. Kaal Gallery. - Are you sure? - Completely! I checked the itinerary and saw that the Chinese delegation is being taken to Kaal Gallery for recreation. The exhibition is called "Elements". You just have to figure out how the river and sun will meet. You check that way, and I'll check this way. Remember your training. "Observe, and it shall reveal itself." "Where the river and the sun meet." "Meet me there." Biren has sent me to get you. Where is Biren? They killed him. Beautiful isn't it? Yes it is. Beautiful, isn't it? Indeed. I meant being a mother. I hope he's not in the mood for fireworks. They are not stupid. They wouldn't want a public exhibition. I have an idea. What happened? Chang isn't following us. I've having deja-vu. Something bad is going to happen. Instinct. Wait here, I'll be right back. Sang, you're safe with us. There's just one more step. Please be safe, okay. Thank you. Come on, let's hurry up. One second. Yeah, Niru. Are you alright? Yes, I am fine. How does she know? Thank God. Come down to the Embassy. No, not the Embassy. You'll be safe here. No. They must be keeping an eye on the Embassy. I'll text you in a while. That's why Chang didn't stop us. M, get the bug out of my phone. 'And track Chang's car.' 'The number is YK16 HSN.' We found the source, but the story doesn't end here. The mole knows about the source now, and so do the MSS. And they will try anything to get to Shang. Great job. I've already spoken about it. Shang will get asylum. Shang risked her life and trusted us. We can't let her down. The Foreign Minister personally took permission from the PM. Where is she? Downstairs. Call her up. We'll go to the embassy, and I'll fast track her asylum. You've done a great job. We're so thankful to you. Shall we? Let me make a call first. Your sniper is dead, Niru. Chang is dead. 'No' 'They must be keeping an eye on the Embassy.' 'I'll text you in a while.' 'Remove the bug from my phone.' 'And track Chang's car.' 'The number is YK16 HSN.' 'This is our last chance, Arjun.' 'I am there. Trust me.' 'I always trust you.' Uma, he's done. I am in position. No one can harm Shang now. You bugged my phone. Try it. And you must follow her. 'Hello, boss, where are you?' 'I don't understand how they came after me.' 'No one knew I sent a message to Yuki.' When you couldn't find anything you're blaming me. 'You should investigate this.' 'If you need any support then tell me.' 'Any lead on Biren Ghosh?' 'Let me know if you find out anything.' 'It's all my fault.' I am not accusing you. I know... you were honey-trapped in Beijing. And to save your career, you sold out your country. And to mislead us and protect you Chang killed Sharad. I love my job more than anything. I did everything to protect it. But some mistakes cannot be undone. I loved Sharad. Not every war is fought on the battlefield or with Foreign policies. Some unheard battles end in the deserted lanes of the city. This is just another story in the long list of unsung heroes. The list that Shang gave us prevented another pandemic, and war. But how long will this peace last?
