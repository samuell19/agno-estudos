Rebecca, what? Oh. What is it? The same thing? No. I... I don't know. I was in a... In a fire or... Or a jail? Or a gingerbread house? Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You still have another hour. Go... Go back to sleep. You sure? You want me to get you something? No. Okay? They signed off? That's great. Yeah, we can start loading a couple of days early. Pray it doesn't rain. Okay. Yeah, I'll meet you there in half an hour. Bye. What? I'm not pregnant. Oh, sweetie. I wanted this. It's okay, it's okay. It's gonna happen. I promise. Don't, Joe. There are no guarantees. I can guarantee you one thing. We'll keep trying. It's a dirty job, but I'll force myself. Maybe I should call the bookstore, see if they need me. No. At least if I go back to work, we can save some money. When your headaches stop, we'll talk about going back to work. You're gonna be late. I still haven't fixed your lunch. Beck, it's done. I owe you one. Now you better get out of here. But if you're late for your mother's birthday dinner, or you forget the wine, all bets are off. Well, now, don't overdo it, okay? My folks don't need fancy. Okay. You know, I've been thinking about the... The headaches and the... The nightmares. You realize they only started after we decided to get pregnant? And? And it could be that the idea of having a baby is... Is just too scary, when there's so much about yourself you don't know. But it doesn't frighten you? No, no, I'm there. No matter who you are. Clean-up on aisle three. Clean-up on aisle three. Oh, oh. We have a sale on our Gala apples today. A four-pound bag for... Adam! Get back here! You listen to me when I talk to you. Do you understand me, young man? I have had it with you! Come on! Let me go! - Get me... - Let's go! Let me go! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go... Mrs. Vega? Mrs. Vega? Mrs. Vega? Mrs. Vega? Welcome back. I'm Dr. Cooper, a neurologist. You're in the Wave Crest Emergency Clinic. What happened? I was hoping you could tell me. Well, I... I have headaches. It's nothing. Headaches that make you panic and then faint can't be considered "nothing." I was in the market. Yes. And apparently you became very agitated. I... I don't remember. Hmm. Oh, I've got to go. No, I... I strongly advise against that, until I can do a full workup on you. I'm fine, really. Thank you. Mrs. Vega, I don't like to alarm you, but you'll be taking a very foolish risk running out of here without letting me finish my exam. I'd like to know where this came from. So would I. Was it a childhood injury? I don't know. I'm going to assume, well, at least I hope, you have your own doctor. I want you to give him my name and phone number, and have him call... Taxi! Abbie? Oh. Oh, God, Abbie! I'm sorry. It's Lynn. Lynn Wyman from Santa Barbara. Oh, my God, it's been so long. I've thought about you a million times. Why didn't you call me? I think you have me confused with someone else. Oh, no, no. No, I don't. Excuse me. Abbie? Abbie, just tell me, did you ever find your children? Where we going, lady? Miss? Thriftway on Kafi. I left my car in the lot. No, no, no, sit please. Isidro, it's the only pizza that you've cut for a long time. It wasn't exactly what I had in... It was fine. I love... Hey, at my age, it's a real guilty pleasure. I never treat myself to any of the cheese and the salt, let alone the pepperoni. You made her birthday, Beck. I'm still sorry. Things just don't happen. You just don't faint for no reason. Mama, I'm sure that the doctor who examined her wouldn't have sent her home if it was serious. Mijo,she had to give up her job because of the headaches. I know, I know. But we're doing fine. We're gonna manage. We had to lean on you guys a couple months, we appreciate it. But I'm gonna be making better money now, I'm gonna be a foreman. I love Rebecca. I really do. And she may be the best thing that happened to you. There's no doubt about that. And your dad and I have come to terms with the problem. Gracias,Papa. I hear a "but" coming, Mama? Having no money is the least of your worries. You're trying to have a baby. And Becky's entire life is a mystery. Look, we spent the first several years of our lives together trying to figure this out. It practically drove us crazy. Enough is enough. You know, we have an agreement now. Whatever her past is, whatever's back there, it stays back there. That's the way it is. We're not gonna waste any more time thinking about it, and you don't have to either. But that's fine, if only the two of you are involved. But to bring a baby into it... I'm gonna check and see if she's okay. Mmm. Hey... Your mother's worried. She's always worried. It's no big deal. I can't blame her. She adores you. She adores you too. I know. I'm hardly... Hardly the kind of girl every mother dreams of. How do you think we'd feel if our son brought home somebody who doesn't even know who she is? Did you mention it to the doctor today? It didn't come up. That's too bad. He might have been able to help you with the headaches. I can't go through any more tests. Not now. Yes? Hello? Ms. Wyman? Yes? My name's Rebecca Vega. I saw you in the street outside the clinic yesterday. You thought I was someone named Abbie. I'm... I'm sorry. I had to find you. You asked me if I'd got my children back. I... I couldn't let that go. I needed to find out what that meant. You don't remember me? I don't. Believe me, I wish I did. Look, I am not crazy. You are the Abbie Stewart that I knew in Santa Barbara a long time ago. Now that... Now that you see me up close, you're sure you haven't made a mistake? You know, I don't get this. Why did you say your name was Rebecca Vega? I was diagnosed with amnesia. It's been about eight years. Eight years ago, you were working in a steakhouse in Santa Barbara. I was your boss. And you had three children. Three? Two girls and a boy, I think. They were quite young. Why don't you come in? Come on. I... I didn't know you that well. You know, a couple of months. And you were kind of a private person. A little sad, really. But you were the hardest worker I've ever seen. I mean, overtime, double shifts. I don't think you ever took a day off from work. But you saw my children. No, they, uh, they lived somewhere outside of town with their father. Chase. His name was Chase. I remember because it was such an unusual name. But you never met him, he never came to pick me up after work or... No. You were alone. You said you'd come to Santa Barbara without a dime, and that's why you were trying to save everything. And then one day, you just left. And nobody ever saw you again. That's all I remember. Wait a minute. I am such a pack rat. I... I can't believe I forgot about this. When I sold the restaurant, I found this. It was yours. Lord knows why I dragged it down here when I moved. For some reason, I just couldn't throw it out. There's nothing of much value there. I couldn't have left them. How could I do that? I'm so sorry. I've gotta go. Winslow, a listing for Chase Stewart, please. Okay. Thanks anyway. Directory assistance, what city, please? Fillmore. Chase Stewart, please. Is that a business or a residence? Residence. Hold for the number. The number is area code 814-555-1130. Once again, the number is area code... Chase Stewart. Abbie Stewart, please. Who is this? I'm... I'm looking for Abbie Stewart. Is she there? Look, whoever you are, I don't know if this is your idea of a joke, but Abbie Stewart is dead. What? I said, Abbie Stewart is dead. Becca? So you were gonna tell me about this Lynn person, were you? Of course I was. I mean, if it hadn't rained, and I hadn't come home early. Joe, stop. Please. I thought I'd ask for Abbie Stewart, she'd come to the phone and this would all be over. Rebecca, we spent years searching for answers. We've never hidden anything from one another, let alone something like this. I know. You're right. I'm sorry. Do you believe it? You think you could have been Abbie Stewart with a husband and three kids? Well, look at the picture. Is there any doubt in your mind? Well, you know, obviously, it looks just like you, but... You know, sometimes people look a lot alike. And this is an old picture, for God's sake. But what about where it came from? What about the woman who's absolutely convinced that she knew me? And when I looked at the list of towns in Alto Loma, I knew that it was Fillmore. I knew what it looked like. I could see it. So maybe you were there once. There could be a million explanations for that. What about the headaches and the nightmares? You said it yourself, Joe, not one headache, not one nightmare until we started trying to get pregnant. Maybe the thought of having a baby just set off some sort of an alarm in me. Because I walked away from my own children. I have to go to Fillmore. You don't. We could hire somebody, a private detective. That guy who followed up on your fingerprints, what was his name? And pay him with what? I'll talk to my parents. Oh, they can't afford it. None of us can afford it anymore. Then I'll get a second job, and we'll save the money. Joe, this is the first real lead I've had in eight years. I can't wait for us to save any money. Beck, you have to wait until I can go with you, and you know I can't get away right now. Joe, I'm not gonna wait. I'm going tomorrow. I'll drive up early. It'll only be two, three hours. I'll be back in time for dinner. And meanwhile I'm supposed to do what? Just sit around here and wait, while you take off looking for three kids and another man you might be married to? That's insane. If you hadn't gone downtown yesterday, if you hadn't come out of that clinic exactly at that moment... But I did. And it happened. And we always knew it could. Fine. You'll have to forgive me for being the most selfish man on the planet, but... I don't wanna lose you. And I'm scared to death. Okay. Matt, it's Chase. Uh, we got a prowler out here around the grounds. It's a woman. She was driving a red Geo. Hi. I wasn't sure you'd have your phone on. I was hoping you'd call. Where are you? I, um, I just checked into a motel outside of town. You said you'd be home tonight. I know and I meant it then, but when I got here, everything was so familiar, the streets, the church, my house. House? I saw it, Joe. I remembered it and it really threw me.MAN: Hey, Joe. I, uh, I can't leave yet. I have to find out if I have children here. How do you think I can come back without even knowing? I just don't know how else to do this.Yep. Don't be mad. Please? I'm not mad. I'm... I'm worried, you know. It's... It's... It's hard not to wonder what's gonna happen to us, Beck. I mean, I keep thinking you could disappear just as easy as you turned up. I won't. It'll be okay. I love you. I love you too. Please be careful. You wanna step out of the car, please? I don't know what the hell you think you were do... Oh, my God. Abbie, what are you doing back here? Are you crazy? Why in the hell would you come back here? Who are you? We were the best of friends. Then tell me something about myself. Well, first, I guess, would be your father. His name was John Swenson. He was a good man. You didn't have a lot, you two, but you took care of each other. And you lived over on Grand. And he built you a cabin up in the mountains. Hammered every nail with his own hands. He passed away about a year after you disappeared. Did my husband ever try to find me? I don't know. Oh, it's late. I have to get back. Why do you have so much trouble talking about Chase? All right. What do you wanna know? Who is he? He's the principal of the high school, a member of the school board. And very powerful. What makes you say that? Because I spend a few minutes outside of his house and all of a sudden, the sheriff pulls me off the road. That tells me a lot. Who is he to make that happen? Well, he's a Stewart. His family owned this town. What else do you need? A lot more. Well, he was a member of the City Council for quite a while. He resigned after your divorce to take care of the kids. There was a divorce? Oh, yes, there was most definitely a divorce. And somehow he got custody of my children. You're never gonna convince me that I gave them up without a fight. Abbie, listen to me, leave it alone. Chase has no idea that was you in front of his house. He has no idea you're in town, and he doesn't need to. I must have loved these children. Go home. From what you say, you have another life now. You're right, it's late. Chase Stewart knows I'm alive, doesn't he? What do you mean? When you saw me, you were shocked that I came back, but you didn't say anything about the fact that I was alive. You knew, didn't you? He knows I'm alive, doesn't he? Abbie, Abbie. His dad's just a bad guy, and Chase is no different. Everybody knows that. The trouble is he's just like him anyway, only not as smart. And that's a lethal combination. He's only teaching because he flunked the MBA program at Stanford and his daddy couldn't buy him back in. Well, I don't believe that. And I wish you'd have some... Some kind of faith in me. Abbie, Abbie, you're just too darn trusting. What he sees is a little girl with a big heart who'll take him at his word. Make up for the mother who didn't stick around. I worry about you. - I got it. - I did it. Hey, Bob, how are you? I'm doing great, Mr. Stewart. How are you? Good to see you again. Listen, I want to talk to you about my son. Pick it up. It's not gonna get any hotter. I'll be right back. Be great. Hey! I asked for grilled onions, not raw. You know, you don't have to be totally bright to know the difference. Did you ever eat eggs with raw onions? I'm sorry. This is my first day. I must have misunderstood. Well, that's not my problem. Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear. You sound upset. Mind your own business, pal. Well, that's what I'm doing, pal. I'm one of the owners. Chase Stewart. You ought to teach your lousy waitresses how to take the order right. No, actually, she's a very good waitress. I'll tell you what, why don't you bring this gentleman some grilled onions, and some fresh eggs. Here, tip included. Don't thank me. Just treat people with a little respect. Makes breakfast a whole lot more enjoyable for everybody. Okay? You, uh, read the stocks? Check the year-old pork bellies there. Hey, not bad. Hi. Oh, hi. I'm so sorry. Oh, don't worry about it. Anybody gives you a hard time, you just tell Frank about it. All right. I'm at a distinct disadvantage here. Why? I don't know your last name. Oh. I'm Abbie Swenson. I know yours. Okay, Chase, she's already impressed. Come on, kid, Frank wants you in the kitchen. Don't get any ideas, Ab. He's off limits to minimum wage earners and you know it. Coffee? Yes, thank you. You're Nell, aren't you? Abbie! Oh, I can't believe it. It is you. Oh. How have you been? Fine. Really fine. And you? Oh, you know, what can I say? We're still here. I swear that'll be my epitaph. "Nell Whitmer was still here." Nell. Just a minute! So when did you get back? Yesterday. Have you seen Chase? No, no, not yet. If you have a minute, I'd like to... Nell. The guys on four, they want their check. See what I mean? Still here. I'll be right back with the menu. Believe it or not, we actually changed it once a few years ago. It's, uh... It's good to see you, Nell. Maybe if we could talk together sometime? Sure. That'd be great. Whenever. What's she doing here? She wants to talk. She said it was good to see me. You're kidding? No. Frank, no! Get off! Abbie's back. Abbie, you get your things and come with me. What? I thought you might like to see your kids. They're just through here. Now let's keep this short, okay? Remember, you're Rebecca Vega, an old friend of mine from high school, that's all. Well, they'll recognize me. They won't. Well, of course they will. They've seen pictures. There are no pictures. What? They were little, Abbie, and, uh, Chase convinced them that it would be easier if he got rid of everything. And they were his kids, they had to believe him. Now I don't want you to say a word about this to anybody, all right? And we're only gonna do this, this once. Oh, my God. Swear to me, Abbie. Clear. Over here, over here. Over here. Oh, quick, throw it. Throw it over here. Wait, Ethan. Nice shot. So you beating their buns off as usual, Ethan? Yeah. You wish. All right, this is my friend, Rebecca. She knows all about you. This is Ethan, and Lily, and Jenna. So... Does he say nice things? Very nice. Then he lies. That's 'cause I don't want her to know what a stinker you are. Are you shy? Sometimes. I'm gonna go check in. Why don't you show Rebecca the pond, and I'll catch up with you later, okay? Have fun. The pond's really pretty. Come on. It's a bee! It's a bee! It's gonna sting me! It's a bee! Help! It's gonna sting me! Help, it's a bee! Where? Where is it? Help! It was right there. Help! I think it got me. Lily, there's nothing. It didn't sting you. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. It's gone now, Lily. It's far away now. It's probably just a leaf again. She always overreacts. Ethan, shut up. I think it was the yellow jacket. Do you know they make the most honey? Really? That's what I heard. Jenna's in eighth, so next year she goes to high school. Really? That's if she gets through English. No, Ethan. Don't hit me again, Lily. Jenna writes better than you. What do you write about, Jenna? I don't know. Just stories. She won't let anybody read 'em. That's okay. It's okay to be private. Not even your dad? Our dad's very busy. What about your mother? She died. Tell it right, Lily. First she left us. Then she died. What's the matter? I'm sorry. I'm sure if she had to leave, it wasn't because she wanted to. Don't be so sure. We're not allowed to talk about our mother. Especially not Jenna. I wouldn't want to get you into trouble. Look. Are those forget-me-nots? Yeah. We have 'em at our house too. They grow wild all over the place. They're Jenna's favorite. Mine too. They're the color of your eyes. Um, we have to get back. Oh, I thought that... Matt knows we can't be late. Come on. Come on. Sorry. Dad wants us home by now. No harm, no foul. I spoke with him. It was really nice meeting you. Come on. You swore. Chase will never know you helped me. You can't win, Abbie. Chase will never allow it. Hi, Abbie. You look good. Thank you. Why is it women always age better? At least in the beginning. How did you know I was here? Well, it's a small town, remember? I mean, do you? Some people say you don't. Who are "some people"? Old friends. See the kids? From a distance. Let's keep it that way. What happened, Chase? Why did you get the kids? Do you remember leaving me? You don't, do you? Well, why did I go? I didn't know then, I don't know now. You were young, the kids came quick. You were pretty hard on 'em. Well, what do you mean? Well, let's just say that you couldn't handle the pressures of motherhood, so you took off. They were devastated. They loved you very much, and you left us, Abbie. The children believe I'm dead. Forgive me, but I thought that was the easier thing to do. I mean, knowing that you left and never even called them, it would have been more painful. Well, you've had your look, from a distance. Now the decent thing is to just turn around and go back when you came from. It's for the children. Don't hurt them again. Please. Abbie, sorry things turned out the way they did. You could not have been that kind of mother. I know you. You know a different person, Joe. You have no idea who I really am. I do. I know who you really are. There's no way you would ever hurt anybody like that, let alone a child. There's no way you would abandon your own kids. You know, that's... It's ridiculous. Beck? I'm here. Did you see 'em? Yes. They were really wonderful. I'll bet. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. Um, I'm gonna try and get a hold of the transcripts of the custody decision. I... I don't expect much. Don't worry about me, okay? Just sorry to put you through all this. It's not a problem, you know. It's... It's just another part of the package. I went into it with my eyes open. Well, at least we know I'm divorced. You and I are legal. That's a relief. I'd hate to think I've been sleeping with a married woman all these years. I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted. Take care, Joe. Okay. Chase! Chase, damn you. Open this gate! Mommy! Mommy! Jenna! Come here! Come here! Hey, Rebel. You remember me. Rebel? Rebel. Jenna. I just wanna show you something. Have you ever seen this before? It was my mother's locket. I gave it to you. And I have one just like it. Both with petals inside, exactly the color of your eyes. Well, where is it? I don't know. When you said that in the park about my eyes, I knew who you were. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth. I promised Matt, and it would have been a terrible shock for you. I know you thought I was dead. You are dead to me. To Ethan and Lily too. Oh, you... Your father told you that because he didn't know where I was. He thought it would be less painful. Yeah, but he told us the truth too. That when you left in the first place, it's 'cause you didn't want us. Oh, no, Jenna, no. My father doesn't lie. Not when it counts. Why have you come back here all of a sudden? Because I didn't know anything about you until a few days ago and... I didn't know who I was. I didn't know I had children or where I came from. I was sick for a long time. That's your excuse. You lost your memory? Yes. Well, now that you know who you are, I guess you can just go back to wherever you came from. But keep that. In case you forget who you are again. Hey. Remember me? I love you, baby. The transcripts from the custody hearings say that more than once I found the baby, age 16 months, lying in her crib unclean, unfed, crying. Stop. I don't want you to read this anymore. It's crap. I'm ready to go home. Rebecca, how can you leave thinking that's the kind of mother you were? You may not want to believe it, but... But what if it happened? What if that's who I was? You weren't. You could never have been. I don't know how to get through to you. But that woman told you. She said that you were trying to get your kids back. Chase Stewart is a liar. This doesn't make any sense. And if I went to so much trouble to get my day in court, why wouldn't I show up for the hearing? I don't know. What's this? Is that your signature? What? This. Look at this. Is that the way you write? It doesn't look right. Look at this. That's your signature. That's not. I never noticed this. Well, it's not like you had nothing on your mind. You see, he's not just a liar, he's a forger. You can't walk away from this now. I'll stay as long as it takes. No. No. I need to do this. Me. If you really wanna help me, you have to let me do this myself. Okay. You really understand? Yeah, I do. I'm gonna get my kids back. Somebody knows what happened. Somebody... Somebody's gonna listen to me. Oh. Yes? There's a phone call. Joe? No, it isn't Joe. Abbie, why are you still here? Why did you tell them I didn't love them? Well, what am I supposed to say? I mean, what kind of mother walks away from three beautiful children and a man who'd do anything for her? I didn't do it. I couldn't. Abbie, please. Why is it always about you? It's about the kids. Now, I'm telling you, stay away from the kids. Thanks, Rosie. And good morning to you too. Eat, Lily. I'm not hungry. Don't start. Dad will be here any second. I'll dump it for her. No, you will not. How come you saw Matt's friend yesterday? Who said? I saw you. Rose? Good morning. So, you do your book report? Yeah. I saw it, Dad. It's in my backpack. Can I see it? Yeah. Thank you, Rose. This is it? Of Mice and Men is a short book. You can do better than this, Ethan. I didn't even like it. Mmm-hmm. Well, that's no excuse for half-ass work. Dad, it's due today. I just have to... Yeah, well, it's gonna be late. But it's gonna be a good book report, don't you think? Yeah. I always preferred that when I was teaching. All right? Thank you. Oh, this looks good. Begin. Lily, hurry up. I'm coming! All right, I want you all here right after school. Rose will pick you up. But it's Wednesday. Lily has gymnastics. Until I say different, you're here or you're home. That's it. But we're supposed to practice for the meet. Yeah, well, anybody you don't know tries to strike up a conversation with you at school, I want you to walk away and I wanna know about it. Is that clear? Yes. Yeah. Thanks. May I help you? I'd like to see Chase Stewart. Do you have an appointment? No. But it's very important and... And very personal. I'll wait. Well, it'll just be a few minutes. You can sit in his office. Thanks. Abbie. What did you do? Abbie? Abbie, are you all right? What happened to me? Nobody will talk to me. Nobody will tell me the truth. You were my friend. Why wouldn't you tell me? If I could help you, don't you think I would? Then tell me, how did I find myself in San Pedro? What happened to me? For God sakes, how did I lose my children? It's too late. Did I love them, Nell? Was I a bad mother? Did I run away from them? Who is it you're so afraid of? Chase? You didn't run away, Abbie. You went to Santa Barbara to work and save money for a lawyer. It was the only way you would have gotten your kids away from him. Jenna? Some lady's looking for you, but she didn't wanna come over. What? She's waiting in the garden. Don't tell me to go home, Jenna. I've already heard that too many times from Matt, from your dad. I need your help. Ethan and Lily have a right to know that I'm alive. I loved you, Jenna, all of you. How do you know? I thought you said you can't remember? Because of how I feel now. And when I saw you in the park, these... These wonderful feelings just welled up inside of me, so strong, so beautiful. I never left you, Jenna, not because I wanted to. I know that you were very young, but isn't there anything that you remember about me? You left us. Well, before that, when I was home? You sang. You danced with me. You said I had wet kisses. Will you help me? What do you want me to do? What's going on? I didn't tell them. Tell us what? I'd like to show you something. That's us, isn't it? Yeah, that's us. A long time ago. Did we know you then? You knew me very well. That doesn't prove anything. You took a picture of us. So what? I'm your mother, Ethan. My mother's dead. No, I'm not. I was right beside you then, just as I am right now this minute. I remember that car. I do. Is it true? I thought you were Matt's old friend. I am. Just another lie. Who is it? Who's there? Hey. Lily. You by yourself? Yeah. I biked. I'm pretty athletic. Where's your dad? He's at school. Rosie's babysitting. Well, won't she be worried about you? Nah, she thinks I'm asleep. I fixed the bed. You know, um, it's not a very good idea. It's... It's dangerous for you to be biking alone at night. I believe you, you know. You do? Yeah. Jenna told me a secret about you. She did? She said our dad used to hit you. Well, I... I don't remember that, Lily. I guess it's not something I wanna think about. He doesn't hit you, does he? Not so much. Ethan, sometimes. He always gets in trouble. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Well, we're not supposed to tell. You remember this? I've been saving it. Jenna told me it was my mom's. It was yours. You kept it all this time? Since I was little. Would it be okay if I gave you a hug? I would never have stopped loving you, Lily. Not for a minute. Oh. Lily? It would be good if we could come live with you, Rebecca. Dad isn't so nice all the time. It would be good. Good night. Good night. I asked you nice, Abbie. Now I'm telling you. Get out of here. We should talk, like two adults. Look, I have nothing to say to you. Now I don't want you anywhere near the kids' school, I don't want you in my office, and I don't want you on my doorstep. This doesn't need to be ugly. Oh, you're playing games with me, aren't you? You remember. I think you remember everything you want to. But I'm telling you, you've gone too far. Now get in the motel, get your stuff, and get the hell out of here. I'm not afraid of you. Don't be stupid. You know better than that. You'll lose, just like you did before, only this time, you'll pay an even bigger price. Excuse me. Oh, just seat yourself. I'm... I'm looking for Nell. Oh, she's not here. She took off for a couple of days. Oh, a vacation? No, something came up. It was kind of sudden. Smells good. Is this the cabin you told me about? The one my father built? Yeah. Just a coincidence that it burned down the night before my hearing? Well, I don't know. Was he violent, Matt? Well, where'd you hear that? My memory's just beginning to come back. Just little bits and pieces. Did Chase hit me? Abbie, it's ridiculous for you to trust these little bits and pieces after all this time. It's better than trusting my so-called friends. Where is this cabin? I want you to draw me a map. Damn it! Save me another trip to the Hall of Records, will you? Abbie, I am your friend. Believe me. And I'm asking you to get out of here before you get in so deep you can't climb out. And I'm saying thanks for your concern, but I am not leaving without my kids. We had a deal. Well, screw your deal. Draw me that map. My lawyers have read every word of the deposition. It's all crazy. Chase can't possibly hope to prove any of it. It must be costing you a fortune. No. I made enough to get him started, but he says he's gonna let me pay the rest out. Well, he doesn't think that the trial's gonna last more than a few hours, with you guys and my dad as witnesses, and my testimony. What? Oh, let's not talk about it so much. I'm nervous as hell about testifying. Are you gonna see the kids? No. The last time I tried, he wouldn't let me get near the house, Jenna was hysterical. Nell? Nell, something's not right. Ever since you picked me up, I've sensed it. Where's my father? I thought we were having dinner with him? He's not coming. Then who is? Chase? Look, he just wants to talk to you, Abbie. He said you hung up on him. He said he's done everything he can. He's lying. How could you listen to him? Let's just go back to town. Forget this. They're his kids too, you know? He loves them, Abbie. Then why are they so afraid of him? Why are you? Frank, maybe we could... No, no! We owe him this much. Why don't you guys take off, come back in about an hour? Oh, but, Chase... I just wanna make a reasonable deal with her. Keep it out of the courts. I'm thinking of the kids. You know that. Go on. Back in an hour? Yeah. Hey, Abbie. How's Santa Barbara? You must have worked pretty damn hard. Hard enough to have my day in court tomorrow. So you're really gonna go through with this? Really gonna leave me. I've already left you. You've already left me. But don't think you're gonna be taking my kids. They're not your kids, they're our kids. They need their mother. Look, you're not getting the kids! Forget it! You're scared. I can practically smell it on you. The mask is coming off, and it terrifies you, doesn't it? Look, what do you want to get out of here now? How much? Say, like, $500,000? You can't buy the children at any price. Look, I have them now! I will have them tomorrow! You can't win, Abbie! I've lived for this. I've worked my ass off for it. It's over, Chase. Tomorrow morning, everyone in this town is gonna know who you are. You damn thing... My God! What did you do to her? Help me get her out of here. - Oh, my God. - It was Abbie's fault. She came at me with the poker. Oh, Chase... Well, maybe it's self-defense. Well, look... We've got to get her help. I mean, they could throw me in jail. Abbie? Abbie, can you hear me? What happened? Who are you? Who are you? Jesus, she doesn't know. Abbie, it's me. It's Nell. We've got to get her to a hospital now. Well, we can't. Chase, you can't cover this up. You gotta let me call an ambulance. Get her what she needs. Get her to a hospital, but not here. - Damn it, Chase. - Not involving me. All right, put her in the car. Get her to an emergency room. Where? As far from this county as you can. Make sure she doesn't have any ID on her. Nothing to connect her to Chase. Okay. I'll get the car. I guess... I guess we can all just pray that we can learn to live with this. What about the mess in here? I'll take care of it. "Make sure there's no ID on her? "Nothing to connect her with Chase?" Why don't we come into my office here? I have my scars, Matt. Do you? For what it's worth, I haven't had a decent night's sleep since I found you in that cabin. It's worth nothing. I guess I'm supposed to be grateful you told him not to let me die? You owe me, Matt. You owe me, and you owe my kids. You were my friend. You broke the law, and you helped him to take away everything that mattered to me. I don't know what to say. I did some stupid things when I was a kid. Chase bailed me out. He made me sheriff. I know it sounds feeble, but I don't know where I would have ended up if it weren't for him. Maybe you'd be someone who had a decent night's sleep once in a while. Now you have to do the right thing. All right, let's get everybody in position here. Luke, you ready? Yes, sir. Okay, let's get started with it. Mr. Stewart? I want this to go like clockwork. Chase? Yeah. Not now, Matt. I don't have time. Well, you better make time. I'll be right back. Okay. No problem, Mr. Stewart. Listen, wise guy, you don't tell me I better make time. I tell you if I have time. Not anymore. I quit. You what? Come here. I wrote it all down. I gave it to Abbie. A copy to my lawyer, of course. Everything from the night you locked her out of the house to the emergency room in San Pedro. You damn fool. She had nothing on us. Oh, she does now. It may not make up for what I did, but it'll sure help. Listen, I can still fix this. This is a stipulation to change custody and an agreement to see the children only with supervision. Two copies. Sign both. You're out of your mind. Everybody in the town knows that. Assault, attempted murder, conspiracy to cover it up. You're in a very vulnerable spot, Chase. Oh, yeah? You better sign. I've learned a lot from you, Chase. School's out. This is the only way I don't press charges. You miserable whore. You think you're gonna take my kids? You have nothing, Abbie! And you'll always have nothing! You blew a good thing! You're a lot of things, Chase, but "good" doesn't quite cut it. Yeah? Is that so? Hey, hey, hey. Don't, Matt. I'll handle this. I'm not doing it this way for you, for either one of you. I'm doing it for my kids. They don't ever have to know what kind of a man their father really is. Know what I should've done? I should have killed you when I had the chance. I should have torched you along with your old man's shack. Just take it and get out. Both of you. Jenna? Bye. You found yours. Yes. And I want you to have yours back. You can't ever leave me again. Not a chance. Mama, I have missed you so much. Rebecca! Lily. Come here.
