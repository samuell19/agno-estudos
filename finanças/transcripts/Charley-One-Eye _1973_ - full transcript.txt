[sighs] [chuckling] I sure do like that sun. Don't you? I's talking to you, Indian. I said, don't you like the sun? No. Well, I likes it. I likes to feel that sweat on my body. [chuckling] Smell that sweet fresh air. Go on, Indian, sniff it, it's free. [laughing] [bird cooing] Geronimo. [Ben] Why you always trying to make me mad, huh? What's the matter with you? [Indian mumbling indistinctly] Huh? What's that? What's that you're saying? All I smell is you. Smell me! Smell me! You might as well get used to it because you and me gonna be awfully close for a while. I'm gonna be closer to you than your skin. [breathing intensely] I was in the army, boy. [echoing] Yes, sir. Private, First Class. [echoing] Paid... ...to kill white men. [shouting] Paid to kill white folks. [Ben] Ain't that a laugh. Lord knows that I'd have done it for nothing. I don't know. I don't understand... One minute they're... ...they're payin' me to kill 'em and the next minute turn around and wanna string me up for it. [gunshot] I don't understand them. You understand that, Indian? [chuckling] Come on, Indian. Let's get on to nowhere. [traditional music plays] Now don't you walk too fast for me now, you hear?

You know they ain't gonna serve no drinks to no goddamn Indian. I buy drink, only half Indian. Sitting Bull, now I knows you crazy. Now, you looks like an Indian and God knows you smells like one. But you know what they gonna serve you, huh? Nothing. A great, big, cold glass of nothing. You knows why? 'Cause you is nothing. I ain't black. Yeah. That's right, but you ain't white either, is you? [Ben] And you ain't red. [yelling] Fact of the matter is you ain't half of nothing. What do you see? Riders, huh? No. Building. - Where? - Like church. [Ben] I can't see nothin'. Why can't I see nothin'? Indian see better than white. Indian see better than black too. [laughing] Watch your mouth, big man. You is probably seeing things. Who the hell would build a church out here anyway? Goddamn, Indian, I reckoned you was mad that time. [Ben] That is a church over there. Preacher man! Hey, preacherman, you in there? Ben. This is Reverend Ben, Ben Lincoln down here. [faint church music plays] I want you all to hear me this morning. Hear me and hear me good. All you sinners. Now, if you don't mind your wicked ways, your lyin', your cussin', your fussin' and fightin', you all goin' to perish. That's right. Perish in hell-fire. That's right. [Ben] But, if you be of the one true faith, colored black, one of God's chosen black people... ...you ain't going to heaven. No, sir. You ain't even going to hell. That's right. You gonna stay right here. Right here where you was born. That's right. So you, might as well as, go on cussin' and fightin', lyin', and lovin' and killin'. 'Cause there ain't nothing, and I mean nothing, nothing worse than that. Geronimo. If I get to heaven and there's any white folks there, or anything approaching white, I'm gonna kill them with my bare hands. [laughing] And that goes for you. [Ben] Where you going? See if water in well. [faint church music plays] Looks empty to me. [splash] Sounds full. How you aiming to get that out of there? Yeah, I reckon we're gonna have to, just have to leave it right where it is. You ain't got no rope, now is you? No. [slow-tempo bells play] [cloth tearing] Well, I'll be damned. Youse a pretty smart old Indian, ain't you? Now why didn't I think of that? Now what you gonna do if that rope ain't long enough, huh? Oh, that sure gonna be a laugh. [Ben laughing] What did I tell you, boy? What did I tell you, uh? Need more rope. Yeah, you sure do, don't you? You the one with the ideas. [Ben] Go on, think of something. [Indian] Rope. [chuckling] Oh no, no. You ain't getting that. You'll have to think of something else. You want water, I need rope. Here. [Ben laughing] [up-tempo music plays] [dramatic music plays] [up-tempo music plays] [flies buzzing] [Ben] Look dead to me. Well, ain't you going to take his scalp? [clucking] Looks like fried chicken tonight, boy, huh? All right, Indian, get ready to go to your happy hunting ground. [gun clicks] [laughing] You sure is one lucky Indian. What if was loaded? You'd just be one dead Indian, that's all. [Ben laughing] I sure hope there's some shells in here. Lord. There must be 100 rounds in here. What's that you got in there? That's some real good whisky. Now you leave this alone here. I know what this stuff does to you redskins. You just stay away from it. [Ben laughing] Yeah, look at that. Must be our lucky day, huh? Forty-five. Here. Go on, take it, I'm feeling generous. Go ahead. Shells? Go and find your own. [dramatic music plays] How much longer, Indian? My stomach's beating the hell out of my backbone. Soon. Oh, shit. You ever kill anybody before, Indian? [clucking] No. Well, it ain't nothing to it. Especially with a gun. What you say? Talk straight. Ah, now, take it easy, I ain't aiming to kill you. [Ben] Well, at least not yet. [clucking] Now, with a knife it gets kinda messy. But with a gun... ...it makes it real easy. All you gotta do is squeeze the trigger. [gunshot] Yeah, that's smelling real good. Hey, Indian, how about you and me robbing for a living, huh? You ever kill black man? Are you crazy? I only kills whites. Besides, blacks ain't got nothing. Don't know how to rob. There ain't nothing to know. Just leave that to me. Must be good to kill white man. [chuckling] I'm beginning to like you, Indian. I can't shoot. Well, just leave that to me. I'll learn you. Sure beats working for a living. We go back to church. Much water. Yeah, that's... that's a good idea, Indian. Real good idea. I raise chicken. What the hell you talking about? I raise chicken. All you do... ...is squeeze trigger. [clicks] Hold... Wait, wait, wait now. - [gasping] - I ought to break your goddamn neck. You say you only kill white men.

You don't shoot nose off, I bet... I bet. Sssshhh... Is that all you got? [laughing] [dramatic music plays] [flute playing] [horse steps approaching] [man] Whoa.

A bank, Senor, here... a bank? [gunshots echoing] Come on, Indian, let's get our money. [Ben] The bank is open. [flies buzzing] [gunshots firing] Shit. Geronimo, if youse trying to rile me, you damn sure succeeded. Don't look like money. Oh, what you talking about? Could be gold bars here. Come on, give me a hand. Kiss my wrist. [grunts] Come on, Indian, let's... Let's freshen up the graveyard. Charley One-Eye, what we do? Do it soon. What's with you and that damn chicken anyhow? Fatten him up real good. He goin' taste all the better for it. Charley One-Eye not food. Why not? That's what you're fattening him up for, ain't it? - Charley One-Eye not food. - Charley. That what you call him?

[wind howling] [flute playing] [gun loading] Go ahead, Indian. I'd like nothing better than to blow you in half. Now, take it out, Indian. Easy. Chuck it up here. Now come on out. Now stand up against the wall. Now turn around. Put your hands up on it. [man] Don't move a hair, do you hear? Or I'll dirty the wall with you. Turn around, nigger, and take your hat off. [man] I've been tracking you for days, nigger. If my horse hadn't died under me, I'd have caught you days ago. I ought to kill you right now. You ain't human. No niggers is human. Nigger, take these. Drop them down the well. Where's your manners, nigger? [groans] Ain't you forgetting? You always call a white man, "sir." Yes, sir. [groans] Now, say it like you mean it. Yes, sir. That's better. Now do as you're told. [splashing] [Ben] One of God's chosen black people. [man] Come back here. Indian, get my rope out. Move it. Stop there, nigger. Just give me an excuse to kill you, nigger, and I will. The army wants you back... ...to put on show. They pay $500 for you alive. Dead, you're only worth 10. Else that's what you'd been five minutes ago. Go and lie down, nigger. Tie him up real good, Indian. What you two boys been doing? Nothing. Don't lie to me, boy. What's that in there? Chicken. [man] You been having a party? Who's in them graves? I wish to know. Two Mexi. Who killed 'em? That black shit? How much did you get? Nothing. Old clothes. Let's go to church, Indian.
