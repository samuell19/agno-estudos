(dramatic music) (regal horn music) (Molly breathing heavily) Morning, gov. Oh, excuse me. Almost ran into her. I said it would work out. Let's hurry. I'm dying of thirst. Oh, that was great. Oh, we've got to stop doing this. Ryan, I love London. I think we should really consider coming back for our honeymoon and really check out the sights, you know? - Uh huh. - Shopping and everything. What do you think? Yeah, it's not such a bad idea. Okay, good. Especially after spending the last four days in bed. But I'm not complaining. Oh, Molly, come on. Champagne? We've just run six miles. I know. I lost a lot of fluids. Toast, come on. To us. To London. I love you. I love you, honey. I love you. Hey, hey, we haven't got time for this. My uncle's expecting us in two hours. I want to be punctual, okay? - Okay, okay. - Why don't you just take a shower or something? Well, maybe I will if you come with me. I am wasted. Come on, just a few minutes. Okay, five minutes, that's all. Make it 10. I love you. I love you. Ryan? - Hm? This letter, I can't make out his directions at all. The famous Usher scrawl. Probably some sort of weirdo or something. Come on, he can't be all that bad. I mean, he did send us the tickets to come here after all. And you've never met him before? I never have. All I know is he used to be quite an artist. What do you mean used to be? Where the hell are we? (dramatic music) It's not on the map. Let me see. I think we're lost, navigator. Just keep going straight. It's that way. Female intuition. Oh, God. Oh, God. Ryan, what is it? What? It's another migraine. Want me to drive? - No, it's okay. - Okay. (dramatic music) Ryan, watch out! (car clattering) Ryan, Ryan? Ryan? Ryan? Shit. Shit! (bird squawking) (Molly pounding) You gotta help me. You gotta help me. The police have already been called, Miss. (dramatic music) No, I gotta go. Are you all right? She's in shock. My husband will take care of everything, dear. Mr. Ryan will be fine, trust me. No, I can't leave him. He's, he's... Come along. No, he's hurt. I can't leave him. He's hurt. We had this accident. There were these kids. We can't leave him. (dramatic music) (glass shattering) This will make you feel better. Thank you. You Americans never travel light. Oh, I'm a hairdresser in Los Angeles, and I brought all my stuff. Why don't you lie down, Miss? Oh God, I hope he's okay. Shh. Has the hospital called yet? Everything will work out just fine. (dramatic music) She's resting, darling. Any news on Ryan? We've just had word from the hospital, Miss. Injuries are superficial. Just a few cuts cuts and bruises. He's going to be fine, just fine. Thank God. When can I see him? He's been heavily sedated. The doctor says he shouldn't receive visitors until tomorrow at the earliest. No, I have to go now. I want to go. I have to see him. As soon as you feel better, dear, my husband will be happy to drive you into town. Young Mr. Ryan's uncle has asked for your company at dinner, Miss. If you'll sleep now, my wife will call you in an hour or two. Look your finest, Miss. Impress the in-laws, if you know what I mean. Thank you. You're such nice people. (disorienting music) (dramatic music) (Molly gasps) Hi. What's your name? Is there something wrong? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you... I'm sorry. [Child] Molly. Molly. Hurry. (children laughing) (someone knocking) Dinner, Miss McNulty. I'm sorry, Miss, but what you're wearing is simply not suitable for dinner at the Ushers'. Why not? You see, Mr. Roderick has an acute sensitivity to light. Certain colors can bring on vicious headaches. Let me provide you with something a little more tasteful. Fine. Fine. Are you wearing perfume? Yes, why? Odors. Mr. Roderick simply cannot tolerate strong odors. This is pretty, isn't it? I wonder who it belonged to. Thank you. You want to try some? Here, sit. Oh, this is a nice one. Look. (laughs) Does Roderick live here alone? Yes, although the house has 24 bedrooms. [Molly] Those are the kids I saw on the road before the accident. That's not possible. They've been dead for 100 years. (house rumbling) The house is very old. It's still settling. Excuse me? This was all marshland hundreds of years ago. Everything is sinking, including the house. We meet at last. Uncle Roderick. No, no, just Roderick will suffice. Roderick. Have you spoken to the hospital? Yes, I did, just a few moments ago. His arm is going to be a little bit sore, but it should heal in a few weeks' time. I'm just worried about him. I'll tell you what, you don't have to be worried. Because he's an Usher. He's very strong, you see. And besides that, he's asked me to treat you like one of the family. May I show you something? [Molly] Of course. [Roderick] That's my mother. She's beautiful. Yeah. My nephew has very good taste. Thank you. Shall we eat? Yes. Where's the salt, please? Sorry, I'm just not used to such British cooking, I guess. Well, that's all very well for you, young lady, but I prefer my food this way. Matter of fact, I insist on it this way. Strong odors, they can bring on the most severe headaches. Migraines. [Clive] Sir? Clive, will you tell your wife I do not expect horse meat to be served at my table. How's yours? It's fine, really. Would you like to try some of mine? No, thank you very much. I have lost my appetite. But enough about food. Tell me about yourself. What's a beautiful woman like you doing wanting to become a barber? Hair stylist, not a barber. And it's an honorable profession. Tell me, what about your people? What about your parents? My dad's an electrician, and my mom sells Avon. Avon, you know, like the perfume. That wasn't exactly what I had in mind. What do you mean? I mean, are they healthy? My great-grandmother lived to be 98. My family had a less fortunate history. The English side of the Ushers, I'm afraid their fortunes have diminished along with their numbers. You sound like Ryan. I don't believe in bad luck myself. (glass shattering) (Roderick retching) You stupid girl. (smack cracking) It was an accident. Molly, I'm very sorry about the scene at dinner. It's just that-- We're all on edge. I want to visit Ryan first thing in the morning. Do you think Mr. Derrick could give me a ride into town? Please, let me do the honors, would you? Oh, I see. The young romantics. You probably haven't spent a night apart for weeks, have you? Almost since the first day that we met. I can't wait till we get married. Molly, good night. (Roderick coughing) Please forgive me. I can't tolerate perfumes and odors. Must you be such a slob? I've had it, Clive. First, the plate's dirty, then the meat tastes like horse flesh. Gwendolyn's clumsy. I told you, you need to be patient a little longer. For what? A bonus? He promised you a bonus at Christmas. What did you get? A leather-bound history of the Usher family. I don't like this business with the American girl. Get another job. Won't be easy. Can't cook. You're a terrible housekeeper. Shut up, Clive. What do you expect, Buckingham Palace? The place is sinking into a marsh. Let the goddamn Ushers eat frozen dinners for all I care. Hold your tongue, woman. (dramatic music) (Mrs. Derrick screaming) Next time. (thunder rumbling) (lightning crashing) (door clattering) Mrs. Derrick? Mrs. Derrick? (thunder rumbling) (lightning crashing) [Child] Molly. (door creaking) [Molly] Who's there? (dramatic music) No, come back. [Child] Molly. Over here. Come on. (Molly gasps) Ryan. (Molly gasps) What are you doing here? You lied to me. You said he was in the hospital. When they finally released him from the car, he had lost so much blood, it was hopeless. No, you're wrong. He was alive when I left him. It was too late to telephone the hospital. You see, it's a long trip into town. They are drastically short of staff. My God, you're crazy. You're crazy. You must understand. We did the best for Ryan. It is important for the family that the family takes care of itself. He was the last of all my family, and he was my nephew. Do you think that I do not miss him? Do you? (footsteps tapping) Take her to her room. No, no, no. I don't want to leave him. No, no, Ryan. Ryan. It has been a difficult time for us all. We are all tired. I will see you tomorrow. We will have a memorial service. Good night, Molly. (dramatic music) Good night. Just a little more, Miss. Come along. No, wait. Wait, wait, no! Please, don't leave me here! Please! (Molly crying) [Clive] Breakfast, Miss Molly. I'm not hungry. [Dispatcher] Seer Green Taxi Company. I need a taxi at the Usher mansion. How soon can you be here? [Dispatcher] We'll send a taxi by in about an hour. What do you mean an hour? This is an emergency. [Dispatcher] That'll take some doing, mam. [Molly] I don't care what it takes. Just get here immediately. [Man] We'll do our best, mam. Do better than your best, do you understand? (door clattering) Yes? A breakfast snack, Miss. No, thank you. I'm not hungry. But you must keep up your strength. At least try some hot tea. Okay. Could you just put it on the chair, please? I know you've got a lot on your mind. But while you're here, could you do something with my hair? Sure. Here's some mousse. Why don't you try spiking it? It's nice. Men love spiked hair. Really? Your tea, Miss. I need to take your tray back. Good girl. (horn honking) (dramatic music) To Heathrow Airport. Let's go. (dramatic music) (house rumbling) (objects clattering) (glass shattering) (glass shattering) [Dr. Bailey] Keep exercising those joints, and I'll come and see you tomorrow. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Goodbye. Do you have a car? So you must be Molly. I'm Dr. Bailey. I'm sorry about your fiance. Roderick said it was hopeless. I don't believe him for a minute. I'm afraid he's right. These rural surgeons are just butchers. But to do nothing? I mean, to just let Ryan die like that? His own nephew? I'm certain that he tried to do something. I gotta get out of here. This place is full of lunatics. They're evil. - Oh, come now. My father was the Ushers' family physician for 55 years. They may be a bit eccentric, but not evil. What about Roderick? You sound just like one of the town folk. They claim the family has a rare blood disorder through centuries of inbreeding. I wouldn't be surprised. And that the disease strikes them down in the prime of their lives. And Roderick? He has an advanced condition of arthritis, nothing more. Rare blood disorders. It's hogwash. Please just get me out of here. Please. All right, but you're making a big mistake. This way. (dramatic music) Who lives upstairs? (door latching) Hide in there. Oh, there you are, Doctor. How is everything today? Going somewhere, Molly? Dr. Bailey is loyal only to the Usher family, I assure you. Only to the Usher family. Molly, this is going to be a simple physical examination. Nothing to worry about. For God's sake, Roderick, give the girl some privacy. Oh yes. I shall be outside if you should meet me. Take your clothes off, please. Go to hell. You've just been involved in a major accident. I'm fine. I can always get Roderick to do it for you. Could you leave the room? I am a doctor. You're in very good shape. You Americans are so athletic. Everything. Take off everything. Well? Everything's in working order. She's even ovulating. Molly. Molly, I'm so very sorry it had to be done like this, but there's so little time. My family is dying out. And now that Ryan is gone, I'm the last of the line. So I have to find a bride. That is why I've chosen you. Don't touch me. You make me sick. I don't wish to hurt her. Why won't she accept me? Women. What can I say? She's a beautiful girl. Those firm legs, absolutely beautiful. (dramatic music) Perhaps she needs someone younger, a bit healthier. What are you suggesting? Oh, nothing really. But if you need a stand-in, you can always call on me. The doctor is a problem, not like his father. No tact. I am fearful that he is going to develop a loose tongue. Clive, will you deal with the problem? (door latching) I always wanted to be a doctor, but I was born to the wrong family. Be a butler, my mother would say. Your grandfather was a butler. Your father was a butler. It's an honorable profession. But I aspired to different things. I thought I was born for greatness. Apparently not. Strip, Doctor. What? I said strip, Doctor. It's time now for your physical. (Roderick clicking) (rat squeaking) I won't be needing a stand-in, Doctor, if you get my drift. (Dr. Bailey groans) But you might. I have a story to tell you, Doctor. It's about a street urchin that nobody loved. It's about the rat in this cage. He hasn't been fed for days, and I mean days. He's so hungry, he's almost mad. (rat squeaking) (Dr. Bailey screaming) As easy as carving a turkey, sir. No doubt our little friend is looking forward to stuffing it. (church organ music) Life begins and ends in this very room for every member of my family. Let us prepare ourselves for our last words. Let us pray. (dramatic music) Ryan, I've missed you so much. How can this be happening? I don't understand. Ryan. Molly, it's time. No, no, wait, wait. It is time to join our hands in prayer. We pray for the deliverance of Ryan's soul into the hands of the Lord where he may join other generations who stood before him, generations who have suffered the inhumanity, the injustice, of a slow and painful death. May his journey into freedom be a swift one. No, wait. One more minute please. I want him to have my engagement ring. Please. Very well. Make it brief. Thank you. Please. For God's sake, Clive, give the poor girl a moment alone. Come, come, come. No, wait. Ryan, Ryan! He's alive! I told you! (house rumbling) (Molly screaming) (Molly screaming) (dramatic music) A present for my reluctant bride. Get this thing off of me! Please let him out. He's gonna die in there. He'll suffocate if you don't. Wait, wait, wait, wait. (dramatic music) (door rumbling) No. (Molly grunting) Ryan. Ryan. Ryan! Damn. [Child] Molly. No, wait. Come back, please. (wind whistling) (stone grinding) (Molly gasps) (Molly shouting) (tool buzzing) [Walter] My name is Walter. I'm Roderick's brother. You must be Molly. I saw you arrive. I'm sorry to hear about your young man. The boy's better off dead. How can you say that? [Walter] I hardly call this a life. [Molly] But he was your own flesh and blood. [Walter] Precisely. We can none of us escape from the cloud that hangs over our life. Ryan was a good boy. I think he's still alive. He's dead, Molly. Ryan is dead. Roderick spent months preparing for your arrival, or so they tell me. I don't understand. I haven't seen my brother in 15 years, even though we only live one floor apart. We were inseparable as boys. Now he's afraid to look me in the eye. I'm a mirror, dear young lady. I am a mirror into Roderick's future. His brain will start to disintegrate. Will you pass me that box? My mother, Genevieve Usher, once the most beautiful woman in Europe, died a morphine addict. Look, look, this is me. I gotta go. I-- We could help each other. How? I must get away from here. I refuse to spend the last days of my life as Roderick's prisoner. I can't help you. You can drive a car. I can't get anywhere in this thing. I'll look for you in the morning. We could escape together. I'm sorry, I can't. If you don't trust me, don't trust me. I don't know who to trust anymore. Roderick had Ryan killed. What? It's true. I saw it when Derrick dragged the boy from the car. He was still alive. I saw him talking. Why? Why would he want to kill Ryan? Why? - Because of you. Because of you. Roderick wants to sire the last of the Ushers. He has chosen you as his vessel. That invitation to Ryan was just an excuse to get you here. I would never let him touch me, ever. He has his ways. I want the Usher line to stop... but Roderick doesn't. I would never inflict this pain on anyone. I am your friend, Molly... I am your friend. You must trust me. Okay. Okay, then let's go. I have just one thing to do first, then we'll escape in the morning. Okay, as soon as possible. I'll start the shower, Miss. You're lucky. We've got hot water for a change. Drink up, Miss. Ryan's alive, isn't he? You've had a long day, Miss, full of emotional ups and downs. He never died in the accident, did he? Did he? Did he? Goddamn it, tell me what is going on! Just take the drink. Make it easy on yourself, Molly. Right, and live like you do? You can't fight them. Well, I'm sure as hell gonna try. I love Ryan more than anything in the world, but you wouldn't know about that, would you? I used to feel that way about Clive. We were married when I was 15. He was a dashing older man. He used to make me feel so special. I was swept off my feet. And now look at you. It's too late. [Molly] It's not too late for me. It's full of narcotics, herbal remedies my mother taught me. It's about all I do really well. Roderick wanted you sedated. I can't help you escape, Molly, I can't. They might try to hurt Gwendolyn. Is there a problem, ladies? Will you excuse us, my dear? We have lots of time, We can take all night if you like. Drink up. Please just let me go. Drink up! (tea splashing) Stop it! Stop it! Move! You're hurting me. (Molly groaning) (dramatic music) (Molly moaning) [Ryan] Oh, Molly, I've missed you. (Molly moaning) Ryan, I knew you were alive. (dramatic music) (Molly gasps) (both moaning) (dramatic music) (camera clicks) (camera clicks) (camera clicks) (Molly gasps) So you don't like perfume, Roderick? This is for you, you son of a bitch. (dramatic music) (Molly pounding) (dramatic music) I've got your favorite, Mr. Walter. New potatoes. Walter? (dramatic music) (Mrs. Derrick choking) (Molly grunting) (wind whistling) (dramatic music) (Molly grunting) (dramatic music) (Gwendolyn screaming) [Roderick] God. Oh my God. (Walter laughing) Oh God. Oh my God! It's Walter. He's escaped. We must find him... immediately. You see, he's a lunatic. (dramatic music) (blood splattering) I've come to take you home. Missus-- Roderick's gone mad. You can walk. I've made a miraculous recovery. Come on. No, I've been all through the house. Trust me. I can't find a way out. Come on, we haven't got much time. What about Ryan? It's too late for him. I know that he's still alive. Impossible. I'm not leaving this house without-- It's impossible. How could you? The same way (tool buzzing) That I can do this. (dramatic music) (Walter shouts) (wall rumbling) (Roderick coughing) Molly? Molly? (Roderick hissing) Molly? Molly, I'm coming? I know you're there. Molly! Molly. Molly. (rats squeaking) (tool buzzing) (Walter vocalizing) (dramatic music) Oh, what have you done, baby doll? (laughs) Come along. Come along, little girl. I'm not going to hurt you. Gwen? Gwen? Come along. [Molly] Walter, let her go! Come along. (Gwendolyn whimpering) Come along, little girl. Come along, little girl. No more wax figures. No more child's play. Smile. Let me see you smile. I want to see you smile. (Gwendolyn screaming) (ominous music) (Molly gasps) Don't touch me. (Roderick coughing) What happened? [Roderick] No, Clive, wait. Oh my God! Gwen? Walter! He must die! Walter must die! (dramatic music) Molly. Molly. [Molly] Shit! I'm not letting you out of my sight. Get away from me. Get away from me! We're leaving this house immediately. Get your things together. Why? Where are we gonna go, to London? You can always get that studio you always wanted. You could paint to your heart's content there. (smack cracking) I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so (coughing). You smell like a hooker! (Molly screams) Like a prostitute! (house rumbling) Why do you want me to do die with the rest of you? You are part of my family now. You see, you are bearing my child. The thought of sex with you makes me sick. I would never let you in my bed. What about your shower? My seed is growing inside of you. That was Ryan. Together, we can create a whole new generation of Ushers. You killed Ryan, didn't you? A slow and painful death seemed to be in order. We drugged him, and then we buried him alive. You're as insane as Walter. You're crazy. Do you really think that I ever thought that you really loved him, hm? You came flouncing into this house here seeking your proper English fortune. You want the Usher fortune, do you? Here it is! You savor it, you little bitch. Do you know what you are, huh? You're a nothing, a nobody, a pauper! No title, no family, no social status. Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up! (glass shattering) Shut up! Bitch! (Roderick coughing) How kind of you to invite me down here after all this time. Is it like looking into a time machine, hm? It isn't often that a man has the privilege of contemplating his own mortality. I have left an heir. You've left nothing. I did leave something. I had a son. You had him slaughtered. Oh yes, I'm Ryan's father. And I say there shall be no more Ushers, and that goes for your unborn child. (dramatic music) The Ushers die tonight. I'm going to kill you. - No, Walter! - She's got to die, Roderick. (dramatic music) (Roderick and Walter shouting) (glass shattering) (flames crackling) (Roderick shouting) (Molly coughing) (Molly grunting) (stone clattering) (Roderick and Walter shouting) (stone rumbling) Ryan. Ryan, Ryan, Ryan! Molly. (Ryan groaning) I feel so weak. You're gonna be fine. Stand up, Ryan. We have to get out of here. What are you doing? Ryan, come on. He's not leaving! He's Walter's son! What are you talking about? Your father, your murderer father! [Ryan] My father's dead. Your father destroyed everything I ever loved! The sins of the fathers, Ryan. You and your family have to pay! No! Ryan, get up! Let him go! (smack cracking) [Clive] I baptize you you in the name of the father and-- (blow thudding) Ryan, are you okay? Oh God. Come on, Ryan, let's go. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. Ryan, come on. (house rumbling) (chandelier crashing) Got you, Ryan! You belong in this house with your family, boy! [Ryan] You're not my family. Your father is dead! Now it is your turn! Ryan! Get out of here. Go! Go on! Get out of here, Molly! Ryan! Get out of here! (Molly screams) I love you, Molly. (house rumbling) Ryan. (glass shattering) Where the hell are we? It's not on the map. - Let me see. - Look. I think we're lost, navigator. Turn around, it's back the other way. Turn around. Female intuition. (dramatic music) (funky upbeat music)
