- You're just a fucking pig! - I want to, I want to. and I'm gonna get it done, it's too hard right now, I'm gonna get-- - Whatever? You're such a fucking pig! - Just hanging out, it's not even a big deal! - I'm always home! - This has gotta stop. - What? Say something. Fuck. Asshole! God! Oh, hey, man, you dropped some quarters. One came all the way over here, if you care. Hey, I have that shirt. - Yeah, you're wearing yours, this one's mine. Look, do I know you? - Yeah, I think we're neighbors. - No, I didn't ask you if you'd seen me before. I asked if you know me. - I'm Linda. - Great, now you've forced me to know your name, Linda. Are you happy? - Wow... uh. I was just trying to be polite. I mean, we do live in the same apartment building. - Sorry if I seem a little harsh. I'm having a hard day. - Ah, yeah, well, join the club. - I don't see you in traction. Your pain must be on the inside. I guess for a first date, it's not too bad, huh? - Being my neighbor, you must know I have a boyfriend, a very large boyfriend. - Well, I've never met him. I've only ever had the pleasure of hearing him throw you against the wall. PlayStation doesn't cry, Linda! - Yeah, well, I'm not the one with the black eye. - Yeah, you should see the other guys. By the way, Linda, did I mention you're awfully nosy? - I'm not the one eavesdropping on people's apartments. - Well, I don't exactly have to hold a glass up against the wall to hear well, what's his name, Dumbfuck, kicking your ass. - His name is Kyle, and he doesn't kick my ass. Half the time you're probably hearing me throw shit. I tend to break things when I'm angry. - Ooh, whoa. - So, since we're prying into each other's personal lives, I gotta know what happened to your eye. - Why? - Just curious. I know I've only known you for a wash cycle and I already wanna punch you in the face. - Hmm. Yeah, my work is hazardous, it's messy. - What do you do? Extreme painting? - What are you talking about? - You're wearing a painter's suit. I mean, you must be a painter. - It's laundry day. You're wearing a chicken shirt. What does that mean, you lay eggs? This is a McConville jumpsuit. It's industrial durability, cellulose based, and on a molecular level, the hydrogen bonding-- - Huh, hydro what? - Shh, it's odor free, it's wrinkle free, and with minimal Scotchgard, stain resistant. I never bother with the Scotchgard. - So if you're not a painter, then why are you so worried about stains? - We're all worried about stains, Linda. This is a laundromat. We're not here at the crack of dawn to make friends, or take a steam bath, are we? It's all about the stains. - So you must just have a messy job that doesn't involve paint. - Look, it's not important. Okay, it's like ping-pong, or dressing up in women's clothing. I don't play ping-pong, by the way. - You're fucking crazy. - Oh yeah, you have no idea. So Linda, who snorts when she laughs, has a dumb fuck for a boyfriend and bullies strangers into conversations. Do you like to eat food? - Occasionally. - Oh, God, no, we might actually have something in common. - Technically, yeah. - So you wanna get some food after you finish folding my stuff? - Go to hell. - Whoa, shh, language. There might be people that actually speak English in here. Lunch, please? - Lunch with you? - Duh. - Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I just think I might have a problem holding my food down while staring at you from across a table. - I'm nicer than your boyfriend. - Yeah, well, everybody's nicer than my boyfriend, which is why I'm doing laundry at the crack of dawn to avoid going home to my, my dumb fuck. - Ha, well, let's not go home together. - Oh yeah, right. - I get it. - You get what? - Yeah, you're chicken, no pun intended. - I'm chicken? - Yeah. - I'm chicken? Oh, like I'm scared of something? - Yeah. - What might that be? - I don't know. Hot young girl, big bad wolf, did I mention you're hot? - Thank you. Look, don't worry about me, I can handle myself. I'm a big girl. But you, a big bad wolf? I don't know, no offense, I just kinda see you more like a sheep in wolf's clothing. - Look, all I'm saying is I could understand why you wouldn't go to lunch with a complete stranger, but thanks for the demeaning characterization anyway. - Oh, gee, I'm so sorry. - I'm starving. There's a vending machine there. - I suppose we could go somewhere public and well lit with plastic utensils and clear escape routes. - Oh, yeah? I'm just saying we can hang out here and breathe this dryer lint in hellhole, or we can walk 100 feet and hang out in Bangkok. It's your call. - I've always wanted to go to Bangkok. - It's weird, huh? I mean, my power. - Oh, it must be a supernatural 'cause it ain't your charm, that's for goddamn sure. - Don't be so obvious, is she looking over here, baby? - No, she doesn't even know we're alive. Would you like me to signal? - Mm-hm. - Did you call me baby? - Just chill out, watch. - You're serious. - Watch. - You want to order something? - Yes, we'll have two beers, she'll have the Thai spring rolls, and I'll have the pad siew, please. - Ka. - How the hell did you do that? And how'd you know what I wanted to eat? - I told you, I'm magical. Or maybe... - You've got quite an imagination there. Is this a hobby, you write? - No, I'm a storyteller. Now if you're lucky, you might make it into one of my stories, but you'd be naked. - Honored. Are you any good? - Oh, I don't know. - Come on, why don't you just tell me a story, then? - Don't mock me. - Look, it's been real but, I've kinda got some panties to fold. - All right, I'll tell you a story. - Would it kill someone to come in this kitchen and help me? I oughta poison all you ingrates! - Stay put, there's knives in there. - Very hot plate. - Thanks. So, where's this story going? - Well, give me a minute, ADD, geez. - Can someone come into this kitchen and help me? I oughta poison all you ingrates! I don't know why I bother! Here ya go, piggies! Oh, whores, bastards! Look at the mess you made! More work for Mommy! Ah, this spoon is singing to me! - Mommy? - Stop. - Mommy, did you remember to take your special medication today? - I made your favorite, wormies with marinada-nada-nada sauce. It's tomato, don't ya know? - Oh, great sauce, honey, great sauce. - Ain't no honey in that sauce, only tomato, only tomato! - Only tomato, only tomato, only tomato, that's all we got. - You! - It's not his fault. - It's always gonna be you, it's only you! - Don't, don't you touch him. - They won't be around forever to save you. Just you wait, just you wait. - It just seems a little tame, dysfunctional family with a loony mom. - Wow. Now, I would've guessed pole dancer, but literary critic, that's amazing. - Don't get bent outta shape. I was just saying that-- - I wasn't finished. - Creepy, I'll give ya that. - How generous of you. - It just still seems a little tame compared to you. - You know what? Fuck off, you try and do better. - You know what? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right, I'm just, I'm in a really foul mood today. I was supposed to be at a friend's birthday party last night and it's like up in the woods, it's at this really cool cabin and my best friends are up there and my sister's up there. - So? - So at the last minute, Kyle decides he's gotta watch some college ballgame and refuses to take me. - So why didn't you just ditch him and go yourself? - Because my car's a beater and Kyle wouldn't loan me his car to drive up there. 'Cause he's a selfish asshole. - That's a nice story. - I just think it's pretty lame that, I'm not sitting with my toes in a lake. - So you missed your party. Still no excuse to take it out on your new boyfriend. - I wasn't, and you're not. It's just that your story was not what I was expecting. I guess I was expecting something a little more horrific. - Oh, you like horrific, do you? - Sometimes. - Here's one. - Need more fish sauce. - Thanks, but for some reason, making me into a killer hasn't really cheered me up all that much. Hm, go figure. - Hm. - Hm, what? - How 'bout I make a story for you about the party you missed. Custom made, I'll just need a little background. - Like what? - Like for starters, where's this cabin? - Big Bear. - Isolated? - Very. - How many guests? - Ooh, uh, Frank, Amy, Ken, Roy, John, Jenny, I know I'm forgetting somebody, oh, uh... Patricia, Pat, my sister. - Okay, which one is it, Patricia or Pat? - Is Pat. - 'Kay, that's it, there's seven? - Yeah, I think so. - Who's birthday? - Frank's and am I telling the story, or? - Fine. - What? - They're not gonna do the whole surprise thing, are they? - You love this stuff, you're like an attention whore, go! - You just, you go first. - Nope. - What? - First of all, my sister's nothing like me. She's not a blonde, she's a brunette, no glasses. - Okay, I should have figured you were one of a kind. - And you have Frank all wrong. Although, he does have tons of tattoos, his hair's kind of long and he's way too cool to drive an SUV. Oh, and there's just a-- - No, that's enough. - Well, I just think that you should-- - No, listen, am I telling the story or are you? - They're not gonna do the whole surprise thing, are they? - You love this stuff, you're like an attention whore. - Wow, what a reception, I'm touched. You guys stoned already, or? - Happy Birthday! - Roy, Roy, do me a favor, keep it real, you just keep it real, this one time, once in your life, keep it real. - How's this for keepin' it real? - Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh! - Oh, no, oh, no! - She touched it. - Oh! - You touched it. - If you're not wearing underwear, say hooty-hoo! - I'm wearing underwear. - All right, let's go. - Does that mean we're not gonna-- - This is something for Frank especially. - I want one too. - All everyone was expecting cabin and rocks, right? - There's nothing sweet about that. - Can I use your light again, man? - Hm? Man, I love you guys. - Aw, it's cute, love you too but, you can go to hell because what I really love is this cabin. - Yeah! - Right? - Yay! - Oh, congratulation! Oh, I know you. You come here some time with a big, handsome man. - Oh, she means Dumbfuck. - Dumbfuck? What's that mean? So nasty. - Oh my God, now I really wish I was at that cabin. - Oh, that'll change, just gimme some time. - Ooh, I'm shakin' in my boots. It's all been very horrific so far. - Well, gimme a minute, I gotta set up the freakin' characters, right? - Yeah, you should just calm down though, I mean, you're so worked up. - Yeah but you, you really piss me off, you know that, don't you? Kiss me. I'll take it out on your friends. - Are we skinny dipping today? - Aw, skinny dipping, really, with the nude? How hippy. - Come on, boy, live a little, man. - Ahh! - I know, you could use some sun, baby. - Yeah, show it, SBBD. - Ahh! - SB, SB what? What? - Skinny Boy Big Dick. - Shut up, it's not that big. - You know what? I think I'm gonna wear my bathing suit after all. - Hey, don't let Anaconda intimidate you, Johnny, you got points. - Ah-ha-ha-ha, suck it. - Let's swim, shall we? - I'm sorry, I just can't keep my hands off this guy. Come here, hey, come here! - Ah, no, stop, man! - Take it, take it, take it. - I've got a rash on my neck. - Ow, all right, all right! All right, I'm done, I'm done, ow, ow, okay. - See that? Brute force is no match for physics. - Physics nothing, more like ball-grabbing, you pole smoker. - Oh, I see, so he beat you in a fair fight and you gotta call him gay? - Uh, no, he grabbed my nuts is why I called him gay. And besides, look how pretty he is, huh, ya see that? - He's got you there, Roy, you are pretty. - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm, I know, I know, I'm pretty like a girl. I can't help it, I'm sick of it. Girls just wanna dress me up like a little sister and guys either wanna beat me up, or get me to blow them. - Oh, oh! - Well, come on, Christ! - Whoa, Roy! Honey, settle down a little bit. We're just windin' ya up. Just windin' ya up. - I know, I'm just messing with you guys. - Okay. - Can I just say how bummed I am that Linda's not here. - Pretty weak. - Yeah, she should be here. - Okay, no, I don't wanna talk about it, all right? It really irks me, and her dumb fuck boyfriend. - Dumb fuck, dumb fuck. - Dumb fuck. Dumb fuck, dumb fuck. - Nice touch. - Dumb fuck, dumb fuck. - Hey, hey, let's go swimming! Last one in is Roy! - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, shit, shit, I forgot my music. - Go to hell. - I'm gonna run back, get my boombox, be right back. - Now, help me design our perfect maniac. - How's that? - Well, like, what should our psycho look like? - Probably like you? - Nice. - Anyways, he should probably have one of your creepy macaroni suits on. - It's a McConville. And how do we even know the guy's a he? - Oh, come on, get real, he's a he. - Okay, what's he look like? - Like, is he wearing a mask or something? - Yeah, whatever. - Hm, maybe it's just like black face makeup. - No, not blackface makeup, I meant like just black face makeup. - That's too predictable, let's think of household items. Very funny. - I'm sorry! Okay, so let's just put a kid's mask on him then. - Wow, that's original. - Well, fuck you. - Why doesn't he just pull a nylon stocking over his head? - Sure, I mean, just 'cause it's cliche doesn't mean it can't be creepy. - Okay, so, we'll all some barbed wire. - All right, I like where you're going with this. - Yeah? It's dramatic, but it's not believable. He'd be shedding crayon crumbs everywhere. - Yeah, you're probably right, so, you just wanna stick to the ski mask? - I'll give you that. But how 'bout we compromise? - That is really creepy. - So we're good to go? - No. I want a pink tool belt. - Get out. - I mean, it's just a story, so I want a pink tool belt. - You're serious? - Yeah. Oh, come on! - I can see why he would bring-- - Why did I leave my gold earring here? - Don't, don't do this to me. Now you see that? I don't need you, Mr. Cable, I have batteries. You're no match for me, it's cool. Stings, does it? All right, what's up, holla! Naked lake, here I come! ♪ I'm like a psychobilly ♪ Mad man sitting on a tree - Help, help! ♪ K-I-L-L-I-N-G Help! ♪ Like a rockabilly zombie on a killing spree ♪ ♪ K-I-L-L-I-N-G ♪ I love to watch you bleed ♪ Well I love to hear you scream ♪ ♪ Well twisting, churning, smash your spleen ♪ ♪ Everybody hides from the death machine ♪ ♪ K-I-L-L-I-N-G - Jesus, what's your damage? - You're kidding, right? - No, what kind of brain comes up with shit like that? - You're such a poser. - Me? - Yeah, you try to act all hardcore but you're really, you're just a girl. - Well, I am, and the people that you're slaughtering happen to be my friends. - It's a story. Besides, I wouldn't think that you would mind considering they're all up there partying without you. Shit, you said they haven't even called you. - There's probably no cell reception. - Yeah, right. - Death is too good for them. - That's the spirit. What? What are you doing, it's not finished yet. - Oh, listen, I'd love to spend all day listening to your perverted fantasies, but I gotta get goin'. - What? Oh, right, yeah, Prince Charming is waiting for you. - So we ate some noodles while you slaughtered my friends. Doesn't make us best friends forever. - I didn't force you to have lunch with me. - Whatever. - No, I'm not buying this. You approached me in the laundromat. I didn't even wanna talk to you but you persisted. And I think you like me in that way. - Oh, dream on. What is your point? - My point? My point is you can't treat me like a novelty. This guy, Kyle, he's a hobby, I'm for real. - No, you're full of shit. And you don't know anything about me. - I know you better than you think. Your voice, it penetrates the drywall of my apartment like a chainsaw. - And nobody asked you to listen. - No, you never asked me, you insisted with your incessant yelling, and your nagging, and your crying. But you're still hot. - Regardless, thank you, for a really lovely lunch. - Well, in lieu of dessert, Linda, why don't you chew on this? Everything else aside, had you really wanted to make that birthday party, you would have been there. Hey. - I'm sorry I bailed back there. It's been a day. - I just figured you were trying to get out of paying for the check. - Oh, shit, no, oh, God, no, I'm sorry. - It's cool, it's cool, I handled it. Let's just say you owe me one. - Okay, are you sure? - Yeah. - Listen, I didn't realize you could hear so much at home. - A lot. - Well, let's hope not too much. - More than I would like. Oh, you meant do I actually hear you two having sex? No, although I would welcome the sound of you and Dumbfuck going at it. - Excuse me? - Anything would be better than listening to the two of you break plates over each other's heads. Now, is screwing the only thing you do quietly, or? Oh, I'm sorry. Sex has been a little scarce lately? I can fix that. - Watch it. - Are you gonna show me your impressive folding technique? - Why on earth would I miss my friend's party on purpose? - How would I know? I was just suggesting that if you really wanted to be there, you would have been. - Oh, come on, use your imagination. I'm just asking you for one fucking simple reason. - All right, I'll give you a couple. If you'd shown up there with Kyle, the two of you would have fought the entire time, effectively killing everyone's buzz. Now, had you gone alone, your friends would have railed on you the entire time about dumping that loser. All I can say is this, I haven't lied to you. I make stuff up in my stories but I'm telling you the truth right now. That boyfriend of yours, he's dead weight. - Do you actually think if I wasn't with Kyle, you and I would stand a chance? - Oh, Linda, I wish this was about us. But it's not, it's about you and your crappy boyfriend. - Shit! Yeah, I know, I know! This isn't easy for me. - Sure it is. - No, Aaron, it's not. - Linda, I have vision. - Come on, 35, 35, we got this, we got this, let's go, let's go. Are you serious? It's two more yards, you pussies! You gotta go-- Oh, shit. - Too good, that's too good. - Nothing's too good for him. - Oh, stop, I don't know if I can take anymore. - That's an interesting way of mourning the death of a loved one. - Oh, he can't be dead. - No? - No, no, Kyle hasn't suffered enough. - It's your call. - Down to 33. - Oh, that's good, thank you for that. - Glad I could help. - You are taking forever. - I haven't perfected the technique. This comes so easy for you. - I think you're stalling. - For what? - I wonder. - You're a strange girl. - Finish your story. - What story? - I get it, Kyle's a jerk. But hopefully he'll start to worry if I don't come home soon. - Worry? We just killed him. - This. - Yeah, one of us should be born more often. - Ew, get that slimy thing off of me. - Come on, you know you like it. - I sense some more commentary coming. - Oh, you've got it so wrong. I mean, Roy is a nerd. He's sweet, but he's a nerd. - Even nerds do it, Linda. - You don't know Roy. - Stop. Amy, Amy, Amy, don't get water in my ears. - Oh, "Don't get water in my ear." - Seriously. - "Seriously!" - It's not funny, Amy. - "It's not funny, Amy." - Stop playing. - Aw! - Aw! - Aw! - Hurricane splash! - Hey, that's for-- - Hurricane splash! - Hey, that's for-- - This is the best birthday present I've ever had. - Sorry I didn't have time to wrap it. - Your birthday suit'll do just fine. - Stop it, shit, stop it! - Did you hear that? - Uh-huh. No doubt our little Roy. No, wait, wait. We can't have all the fun. Let's give our friend a little show. - You are so bad. Mm, God, fuck yeah. - Ow, what the-- - Pig. - Ow, what did you do that for? - Shh. - Ow! - Who needs the internet? - Oh, man! I only came once. Okay. Come out, come out, whoever you are, Roy. - Yup, as Roy's friend, I think it's only fair I give him a little taste. - You're kidding, right? - Oh, sorry, did you wanna do the honors? - No, no, thanks, I think I'll pass. I will say that you are one generous friend. - Me generous, um, have you seen Roy's package? I mean, he'd be doing me the favor. - All right. Well, and with that, I think I'll just cruise my way down to the lake. Okay. Bye. - Bye. Roy? I got somethin' for ya. Too late to be shy now, baby, come on. - That is so sick. - Yeah, but it's hot, right? - Not really. - You're so jaded, you wouldn't even admit it if it were the hottest thing you'd ever heard. - Okay, first of all, not that impressed, and isn't it kind of a cliche to kill people for having sex? - No, it's not like that. - Oh, it's not, is it like old-school slasher style? Kids go into the woods, tits come out, I mean, hockey masks and machetes can't be far behind. - Oh, please. - A psychopath punishing young people for having a good time. That is so tired and so derivative. - Fuck off, think about it. In a social situation, like a party, or a camping trip, sex would be a time when couples separated from the herd, right? - Lame, if I remember, your last scenario was practically a threesome. I mean, why does it always have to be sex? Someone can't like stumble into the woods to like, read a book? - Well, you have friends that can read? - Funny, oh, and there's just one small detail. - Uh-huh? - I know you worked extra hard on the Frank-and-Jenny-humping scenario, but Frank happens to be gay. - Oh, a small detail, huh? - I tried to tell you this earlier. - Okay, I'll try again. - Roy? - Yeah. - Oh my God, are you okay? - It's only 10 feet down. Aw, man, it smells like poop in here. - Aw, shit. - Oh my God. - You all right? Jenny, what are you doing? - Somebody pushed me! Fuck! - Hello? - Hello? - This isn't funny, come on. - Disgusting. - Throw down a rope and pull us up. I'll go up and then I'll pull you up. - All right. - Hold it, hold it, all right, I'm comin' up. All right, come on. - Funny. - I'm just tying up loose ends. - Where's Jon? He never made it to the lake. - He's probably hiding somewhere. He's probably waiting for us to stumble upon him so he can scare the shit out of us. - Well, he's gonna have a long wait. - Probably stoned and up a tree somewhere. - He's definitely wasted 'cause he left his precious music behind. - Roy and Jenny are nowhere in sight either. - They'll be fine, believe me. - Are you sure Roy'll be safe in Jenny's hands? - Oh, I think he's in more than her hands. - Oh! - All right, guys, let's not be rude about our resident man-eater. - Roy and Jenny hooking up, uh-uh, no way. - Let's just put it this way, Jenny'll give Roy something besides sci-fi to obsess about. - You're such a pig. - Our little Roy is boldly going where many men have gone before. - Yes, exploring spectacular planets. - Entering warp space. - Shut up. - He's being swallowed by a black hole. - Okay, really? Okay, you're just gross. - Well I, okay. - Where are you going? - Well, none of us know how to make toast. So, I'm gonna go find Jon, pry him out of his tree, and get him to rustle up some grub for the troops. - Oh, yes, please, I'm starving. - I can make toast. What are you doing, Miss Thang? - Let's get the damn candles on this thing. If Frank doesn't find Jon soon, we're gonna have a red velvet cake for dinner. - A lawn mower in a forest. Good luck. Hello? Man, you scared the living-- - Shh. - Don't shush me, motherfucker. I'll fuck you up. Come on, come on. Thanks, but, not really my thing. You know, you're really starting to piss me off, you know that? You know, I could break free if I wanted to. Alright already. It's not funny anymore, okay? What do you want from me, huh? Huh? All right, let me go now. I'll do anything. - Anything? I want you. - I bet you do. - Mm, happy birthday, baby. - Happy birthday-- - Gimme that. - I'm glad you came, Ken. Wait till I get my hands on you, you little slut-- - Yep, you will have to wait to get your hands on me. - Oh, yeah. That's right, grab my, oh, fuck. Oh, shit, Jon, fuck! - Shit, Jon, this is a private party. You know, I appreciate you dressing up and all. And by the way, what are you doing with that nasty-- Wow. That was killer, Jon. Now go be a stud and go make dinner, everybody's hungry. Show's over, nothing to see here. You're a bad boy. - You guys made this one too easy. - Motherfucker. - Don't think this is happening because of your lifestyle. I wish I could feel one way or the other about it. - Please-- - I wish I could feel anything. - Ready, talk. - Okay, you see this? Look, see this, you see these girls? - Do you like-- - Pop it. - Ow, fuck! Ow, man. - Show me, show me. Whatcha got, whatcha got, whatcha got? - That's all I got. Oh, God, that song must never see the light of day again. - We're never gonna see the light of day again unless we have someone come and feed us some real food. - So it's been real. - I don't believe this. Don't you wanna know how it ends? I'm one scene away from finishing our story. - Our story? I'm not taking credit for the pink tool belt. - Ahh, well, I'm pretty sure I'll be seeing you around. - Hey, you know where I live. - Yeah. Yeah, okay. Uh-- - Oh, it's okay, I'll take a rain check. - Oh, uh, yeah. Fucking motherfucker. Fuck! What an asshole. - Hey, it was an accident. - What? - Here, take it, got mixed up in my things. Innocent mistake. - I could fucking scream. - Well, you just did. It's paper thin, remember? - It's like, it's as if... It's like Kyle fucking won't even let me go to the cabin so he that he can stay home and watch some game and then he just bails? Like he'd just bailed? - Are you surprised? - I'm really sorry. I don't mean to put this on you, it's just, I either harass you or I trash my apartment more. - Well, I don't wanna invite you in because I don't want you to break any of my things. - I'm really fed up. - Yeah, I can see that. - I'm burning. - Let's see, you don't strike me as the whiny type. You're not a total ice princess either, so, if I had to guess, I would say that you would opt for revenge. - Yeah. - I have the perfect thing. - I'm listening. - How long do you think it would take to get to that cabin? - A few hours. - Let's go. - You're crazy. - I can finish telling you my story, you can piss off Kyle, I won't wear my creepy jumpsuit. I'm just offering you a ride. I'm not gonna ask you again. - Okay, yeah, let's fucking go. - Yeah, great. I'll see you at the car in like 10 minutes? - Are you sure about this, I-- - Oh, yeah. - Okay. Take the jumpsuit off, please. - Yeah. Hello? Why do people say that? - Because it's funny. - I don't know, what do they mean, like don't have a cow, don't behave like you're having a cow, what? - You are a such a ponderer. - These are important issues. - Who knows, it's like, why do people say don't rub it in? - I know that one. My great grandfather told me that in his day, people used to say, you can shit on me, just don't rub it in. - Oh, you know, I don't believe that, I think that's bullshit. - Why bullshit? See, bullshit is just grass and grain. - You what what the worst type of shit is? It's human vegetarian shit. See, I used to have this roommate and all she would eat is spinach, and bran, and wheat grass shots. I swear to God, it was rankest thing I've ever smelled. It's kinda like a mossy swamp, rotten eggs, garlic-- - Oh, okay, I get it, I get it, that's enough. I get it. - Yeah, now who's hardcore? So, finish tell me the story. - Oh, that old thing? - Yes, now. - Well, don't have a cow. - I'm gonna be sick, I can't eat anymore of this cake, ugh. - Shit, shit. Shit, you know, this isn't funny anymore. - It stopped being remotely funny about two hours and an empty can of Cheez Whiz ago. - Okay, something's wrong, something's happened. - Okay, well, let's try to keep it together. Okay, how can something happen to five people at once? - Okay, well, where are they then, huh? - Probably screwing, I don't know. - We've been through this. Frank and Ken can go at it all day and night, but Roy, Jon? No way, and even if that miracle did occur, with who, hm, Jen? Yeah, pfft, never gonna happen. - Uh, our Jen? - Okay, fine, I'll give you that, Jen would nail anything on legs. But it doesn't matter because they should have been back by now. I mean, what, I give it like three minutes for Jon and a 30-second out-of-body experience for Roy. It's been three hours since we left the lake. - Okay, whoa! Freaking out about it isn't gonna help anything, okay? Breathe, let's just come up with a plan. - A plan, Pat? You don't even know what's going on? What do you wanna plan for? - Let's think of other possible scenarios. - Oh, sure, like what, alien abduction? - No, like other kinds of accidents. - Okay, hm? - Like what if they fell down an abandoned well? - Give me a break, five people fall down a well? Yeah, maybe they were eaten by alligators. Gimme a break, Pat, I mean, God, even our friends aren't that stupid. - Maybe they were treed by a black bear. - Oh my God, your plan is to go up against a bear? Forget that. - Maybe they just ran afoul some locals and they're all hangin' out. - Oh my God, hillbillies? You gotta be kidding me. - I'm just saying, if we're gonna go out there to look for 'em, maybe-- - Whoa say what, go out there? Oh, no, you shoulda thought of that when it was light out. - Amy, wouldn't you want them to come look for us? Mm-hm, thought so. So we're going, let's go, come on. I got a flashlight fo' you, mama. - Well, at least we got flashlights. - Okay, and I will write a note just in case they come back. - Oh, yeah, sure, Dear Assholes, if you're reading this, fuck you. - That's nice, that's really sweet of you. I'll write that. Be careful, you good? - This sucks. Ow. You know, we brought everything but insect repellent. - Amy, stop complaining. - What, I'm being eaten alive. - It's called nature, be one with it. - Well, you know they're out there screwing around and we're stumbling around here getting Lyme disease. - Please, really? - What, I'm just saying. - Saying, and saying, and saying. - What? - Let's just start at the lake and we'll work our way back. This is so cool. - This really sucks. I'm itchy everywhere. - Oh my God, Amy! - Jesus! Oh my God, now I have a fucking headache. You're so easy to mess with. - It's so quiet. - Yeah. - Hey, idiots! - Nothing. - Pat, I'm kinda really scared. - Yeah, I'm right there with you. - I mean, this isn't right. What are we gonna do? - Think we better go get help. I got somethin' for ya. - Hey, was that? - Yeah. - Assholes. - Let's just be glad that they're okay. - Oh, I'm glad, I'm gonna mess 'em up real good. - Well, that's nice of you. - What? You're not pissed? Look at you. Look at you with that stupid fucking backpack. - Well, maybe because I'm the leader and I'll take care of things and you won't, look what you're wearing. What, a hoity-toity, what, you going to the cabaret in the forest? - Shut up. - I mean, really. - At least I don't look like a mom. - Why don't we just go back to the campsite. - Oh, jerk-off? We're gonna kick your asses. - Yeah, and that's gonna bring 'em running. - Shit, I don't care, I'm pissed. - Shh. - So busted. You're so dead! - Who the fuck is that? - Jesus, oh my God, oh my God! - Hey, gang, what's for dinner? - Amy, come on, come on! - Where are we going? - Run, run! I don't know, keep running! - Where? - The boat, run towards the boat, hurry, come on. We'll get as far away from shore as we can. - Oh my God, Pat, Jenny's dead. - I know, Amy, focus, the boat. Come on, come on, come on, come on-- - Glass bottom boat, anyone? - You sick fuck! - Actually, I feel fine, how 'bout you? Ooh! - Run, Amy, go, run! - Pat, Pat, Pat, he's got me! - Don't stop, Amy. Oh, my God, Amy, Amy, okay, okay, Amy, okay, okay, don't do this right now. - They are all dead-- - Don't do this right now, don't do this right now! - Ow, ow! - Stop! Listen to me, you know what else is gonna happen? Is we're gonna live right now. We're gonna live through this, all right, all right? This is what we're gonna do. Okay, I know, I know, I know, just gotta get keys, okay? You're gonna get Frank-- - I don't think I can do this. - You're gonna get Frank right now, okay, okay, go. Go, go, go, you have to be quick, you have to be quick. - I can't, I can't, I don't know where they are, my God. - Find them, Amy. - I can't, I can't. - Okay, shh, shh, shh! Get in the car, right now. - Don't hit me. - Maybe if you don't get in the fucking car-- All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right. - Oh my God, oh my God! - Get the fucking hood up right now! - It won't go up, it won't go-- - Pull up the hood! - Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys! - Oh, no, oh my God, oh my God. Let us go! Don't! - Gimme the keys, gimme the keys! - Oh my God. - What the fuck? - I think I found your keys. - Okay, okay, okay. - Now what, now what? - You know what I'm gonna do? You run, okay? I'm gonna fucking and you're gonna run, are you ready? I'm not kidding, you have to run your ass off, ready? Okay, ready? - What, are you crazy? - Yes, one, two. Come on, Amy, come on! Come on, come on, Amy, hurry. Come on, push, push. Amy come on! Amy come on! Run, we have to run! Come on, run, run! Go, go, go, run! Shit! Get up, Amy, get up, get up! Fuck you! Amy, oh, fuck. - Oh, hammer time. Bash it, break it down. - Don't you dare. - Sure, what? - Don't you dare do anything to Pat. - What are you talking about? I take no prisoners. - I'm serious. - Look, it's just a story. - I don't care! That's my sister! - Okay, I won't. - You swear? - Okay, I promise I won't kill your sister. So, we're right back where we started. Ooh, you're shot. - Go to hell. - Language. You're the last. Are you gonna go easy, or are you gonna make this hard? - Why are you doing this? - This is real life. There's no sense in any of this. It's just the way it is. Fucked up, huh? - Please tell me why you're doing this. - Jesus, everybody's always gotta know why. It's embarrassing, and you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Ow, biting! Oh! No fair. - Die, you piece of-- - Woo-hoo! - Thank you, thank you. - Wow, so it was you the whole time. - Yeah. - Nice. Oh. Wow, this doesn't-- - Doesn't look right. - Yeah, it's really quiet. - Maybe they're at the lake, hiking. - Oh, my friends? No, no, see, they're permanently tethered to a beer cooler. They're like good for 20 feet off shore, max. They don't really swim either, they kinda flop around. - What was that? - I don't know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? - Look, this doesn't feel right. I think we should drive back down the road until we get a phone signal, call someone for some help. - No, no, those are my friends in there and what if something bad has happened to them? - Linda, I'm many things, but I'm no hero. - God. - No, no, no, no. I'm gonna go investigate. - Yeah, let's go. - No, I'm gonna go investigate under the condition that you wait here and you do not follow until I tell you it's safe. - Oh no, you do not leave me in this car. - Look, Your Highness, you're gonna do what I tell you to do or I'm gonna drive us both out of here right now. - Okay, okay. - What? You're a loony. - Be careful. - Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, fuck this. Aaron? Aaron? Fuck. Fuck. Goddammit. Aaron? Aaron? I swear to God, Aaron, if you don't answer me... - Run! Patricia. - What the? Uh-oh. Surprise. Told you I wouldn't kill your sister. Really, Linda, I have to say, I'm very disappointed in you. I had you pegged as a fighter. Maybe it's better that you folded early. 'Cause I'm exhausted. Getting you out here was a real chore. Constant nagging. Day in and day out. Like fingernails on a chalkboard. Wanna see something cool? This is my passion. It's sort of a spin-art scrapbook of my greatest hits. Here's Jon, Amy, Frank, and Ken. Here's Jen, Roy, oh, look, here's a little of your handy work. It's your sister, Pat. - Fuck you! - You know, I do like you, as much as I can like anyone. I know I'm a nut. There's really nothing I can do about it short of the death penalty. Hm. You know, if this had been in one of my stories, you'd be laughing out loud, right? Someone getting cut with a knife full of buttercream? - Hey. Baby. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - You all right? - Yeah. Thought I was dead. Get those untied. - Hey, it's okay. Nobody kills my girl, all right? - I think this makes up for everything you've ever done. - I think you broke my jaw. - Let's double check. Enjoy your birthday cake, Dumbfuck, it's your last. - Fuck you! Fuck! Is he? - Yeah, I believe so. I'm sorry for everything. I love you, you know that, right? - I love you too, I love you so much. - Things are gonna be different. - Oh, no, let's not talk about that right now, okay? Let's just get the fuck out of here. - Yeah. - What the? Oh my God. Oh my God, Kyle, what's happening? Oh my God, Kyle? Kyle, what's happening? Oh my God! - You know, you were really the only one I ever wanted. But when you were a no-show, I had to improvise. And I live happily, ever... After. Hm, the neighbors are so quiet. Hope they're okay. Zzzz! Is it all right if I keep this, as a memento? Thanks. You know, I almost feel sorry for you, dude. You're not gonna be around to enjoy the peace and quiet. Dad would be so proud. - You! It's always you. You! It's always you. It's always you. It's always gonna be you. - This really hurts. I hope that doesn't stain. - Look at the mess you made!
