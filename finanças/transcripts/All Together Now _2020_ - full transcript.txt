Okay, class, today's song is "The Clapping Song" by Shirley Ellis. When you sing, I want to hear every word clearly and succinctly. Yumi? Can you sing it first, Amber?

Good job! Mom. - Hi, baby. - You're late. Where have you been? I know, I know. But I brought you something. Look. Got you some dinner. This is dessert. Who says dessert can't be dinner? Uh, nutritionists? You telling me nutritionists don't like cheesecake? This is from the Copper Kettle. Did you sit at the bar? I had one glass of wine. - Just one. - You're not supposed to have any. But it was... It was just one. So Oliver's back in the picture now? No! No, not really. This just... This is a way to get us some dinner. This isn't dinner, Mom. You were supposed to look at apartments, not get cheesecake from Oliver. Well, that's all that he could give me, so I took it, and I'm sorry that it's not good enough for you. That's not... Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's really good, Mom, actually. Here. - No. I don't want any. - Have some. Don't be mad. - Just a little bite. I promise. - I'm not mad. It's the best cheesecake I've ever had and you're saying no. - Right? - Yes! - It's very good. - Oh, it's so good. Oh! See? I told you! Mm. Thank you. You're welcome. "Hope is the thing with feathers." That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all, And sweetest in the gale is heard; And sore must be the storm. That could abash the little bird. That kept so many warm. I've heard it in the chillest land, "And on the strangest sea..." "Yet, never, in extremity, It asked a crumb of me." "Sore must be the storm." Some storm we're in, huh, baby? Yeah. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. We're gonna be okay. Okay? Way to aim low, Mom. We're gonna be awesome. We're... we're gonna be spectacular. That's my girl. Up and at 'em, kid. Bye, Mom. Bye, baby. - Have a great day! - Thanks! Christian, John, good morning. Would you like a donut today? Thank you. Thanks. Good morning. - Donut? - Thank you. Thanks. Hey, Mr. Linder. It's me, Amber. Amber Appleton. Remember me? Um... Uh... Are we related? No, I work here on the weekends, but I had some donuts, so I thought I'd stop by. You want one? Careful, it's a category three in there today. Could be worse. - Who is it? - It's me! Oh, I thought so. Scram! Morning, Joan. Has anyone ever told you that you are loud? Good morning, Joan. - "Good" is a matter of opinion. - Well, here's a fact: Rainbow sprinkled donut? The best donut, and I saved it for you. Mm-mm. No, no. Okay. I'll eat it. Uh-uh! Some, uh, soothing entertainment to start your morning? Yep. Right. Uh, could I use your shower? Our water heater's still on the fritz. You know, when I was your age, we didn't have hot showers. So, is that a no? Be my guest. Ooh. You wanna hear a joke? That's a no. You're gonna laugh this time. Ready? What do you call a fish with no eyes? Fsh! Careful, Joan. One of these days, I will make you laugh. Not if I make you cry first. You couldn't make me cry if you tried. Ricky! Good morning! Breakfast! Ricky! Come on, dude, we have school! My BB-8 clock said 7:12. Yesterday, it was 7:13. Tuesday, it was 7:14. What's your point? You're waking me up a minute earlier every day. You're on to me. The master plan is to eventually wake you up at 4:00 a.m. Then midnight? Then yesterday. Before I even go to sleep! Which would totally suck, but might be sort of cool, because then we could eat breakfast together and stay up all night. Uh-huh. Your mom's home. She's early, too. - It's a conspiracy. - No! Good morning, Donna. - Hey, you two. - Hey, Mom. How was work? The night shift. It's, uh... life's rich pageant. Amber! Ty's here! Please, don't get up. Amber! You left this on the counter. Right. Thank you. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, sweetie. Have a great day, Amber. Always. Hendrix? Fox and Fox. - Hey, Amber. - Hey. Hey. Hi. Hey, Jordan, is that a coloring book? Because there are Marquez all over the pages. Impressive. Thanks. We've had 31 days of school, that's 31 rides. Thirty-one sandwiches, too, am I right? - So many sandwiches. - Okay, seriously, Ty deserves a sandwich because he has to leave the house way earlier than the rest of us. - And I'm the only one who owns a car. - That's true. - A car? Okay. Well, this... Not a car. - Technically, I don't think you own it. He's the only one with access to a car. - Yes, thank you. Access. - Call it a vehicle. I still fail to see how any of this warrants a sandwich. - Thank you. - Just sayin'. I think Amber's got a crush on Ty. That's why she makes him a sandwich. ♪ Did you really wanna With Alice? ♪ ♪ Did you really wanna With the wolf? ♪ ♪ You can hate us all you want but ♪ ♪ It don't mean nothing at all ♪ Do you guys realize the marching band's been playing all year without a tuba? Somebody stole it over the summer. Yeah, look at Ryan Gold. She looks weird. She looks sad. They've played half the football season without it. Now that state championships are coming up, if they don't have a tuba, - they're automatically disqualified. - Okay, but who steals a tuba? Someone who's really horny for it. It's technically a sousaphone. You could get a lot of cash for one on the dark web. Why don't they get another one? Borrow it or rent it, I don't know. Sure, Ty. Why don't you just lend Ryan your extra tuba? - "Sousaphone." - Nobody's stepped up. About three, four grand should do it for a proper marching model. Is she on the dark web right now? I say we make the tuba this year's cause for the Variety Show. Doesn't the school decide that? Amber runs the Variety Show. She started it. But how do we get people excited over a tuba? Oh, my God, "sousaphone." I don't know, but we have to. Just look at Ryan. - Hey, Amber. - Hey, Leah. Leah is awesome. You know, she's auditioning for Oklahoma! This year? Is that right? - You know where this is going, Ty. - Yeah, I do. Come on! Mr. Franks thinks you'd make a great Curly. We all do. - We need you this year. - I don't know. Getting on stage in front of all those people, it's terrifying. You play soccer in front of all those people. Yeah, but I don't have to bust out with a show tune. Or wear a cowboy hat. I think you'd look great in a cowboy hat. I've been trying to text you, but I keep on getting delivery failure. Yeah. Uh, that's a whole thing. I lost my phone, and I haven't had a chance to get a new one yet. I was hoping we could have, like... a private conversation. Cell phones aren't private. It's much better to stay off-grid. Plus, I'm the only teenager in all of America who doesn't have a cell phone. How cool is that? Not cool at all? So, it... it takes place in, um, I'm assuming Oklahoma. Yes! So, that's why... That's why we're trying to bring you in. - All right, you got it. - That whole dynamic going on... Hey, guys. - Hey, Mr. Franks. - Franks! Dig your shirt. Mr. Franks. That's very nice of you. Thank you very much. Yeah, what's, uh, going on over there? You know, it's just sort of some outdoor tableaus. You know, some people listening to music, and sitting on a park bench. - Trees, and tennis, and... - It's stylish. I like it. I like it. Do one of 'em have a... One has a mullet. - It's very '80s. I like that. - Yeah, it's very you. We approve. - Franks. - Not necessarily the '80s, but... - Oh, maybe it is. - Mr. Franks? Appleton? Can I show you something? Sure. - Just... - What am I looking at? Whoa! Wow, look at that! - Does that mean that I... - Yeah. You're being asked to audition at Carnegie Mellon. - Amber's going to Pittsburgh. Look! - What? Of course she is. - That's amazing. - No way! This is your dream, Amber. That's incredible! Oh, my God! What song are you going to sing? Pittsburgh? How are you going to get to Pittsburgh? Good boy. Mom? Hey. Bobby. Hey. Shh. I'm sorry, baby. I was so tired, I just fell asleep. At Oliver's. You have his truck. He's asked us to move in. And I think we should do it. So everything's fine now? He has a good side. Yeah, and a bad side. We're gonna get caught. And it is getting cold outside. I'd rather freeze my ass off on a bus than go back to Oliver's. Why? He wants to help, and we still don't have enough money for an apartment. What if we tried the shelter again? No, I'm not going to the shelter. No. So that I can have people questioning my parenting? No one can find out about us. You understand? Because if they do, I'll lose you. Let's just talk about this when you're in a better mood. I got invited to audition for Carnegie Mellon. What? My God. Your dad would be so proud. How does it work? You sing for them? Yeah. And then they crush my dreams. They won't. You're gonna be great. How am I even gonna get to Pittsburgh? You've been saving money, right? Yeah, for an apartment, not some stupid audition. No, you buy that ticket. Because this is your dream. You see? Things are lookin' up. We're gonna be great. Without Oliver. Okay. Okay. So what's with you today? You're not yappin' all over the game like you usually do. Nothing. I'm just thinking. About that boyfriend of yours? I don't have a boyfriend. Ty's a friend. We're buds. "Buds." Buds, yeah. Have you hooked up with him yet? Joan! Get over it, and quit wasting your time thinking. Youth is precious, so you should enjoy it. That's the most positive thing I think I've ever heard you say. Well, it's just another way of saying that life is nasty, brutish, and short. And then you die. That's my Joanie. Ooh. Okay, Ricky. Egg puns. Go. Oh, um, okay. Well, I only know a few, so this will be over easy. Omelet you use that one if you want. Okay. You can poach it. Ooh, nice. Yeah, it's funny, because... I usually only eat eggs around hollandaise. - Good morning, honey. - Good morning, Mom. - Hey. - Sorry, did we wake you up? No, I was up already. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. I noticed you've been using my makeup. Oh. Donna, I'm so sorry. It's okay. I used to dip into my sister's makeup all the time, but it's kind of gross. So... I got you this. Thank you. But I can't take this. What do you mean? Sure you can. No, I just... I don't wear makeup. I was practicing. I'm really sorry. It's a gift. I know, and it's really great. I just... I don't need it. Amber, are you all right? Yeah, I'm great. Never better. Poetry. Sweet. Thank you. The tuba's a great cause, and I know you'd shine up there. I don't have any real skills, Amber. Sure, you do. When you close your eyes, what do you imagine yourself doing? Tommy, you're going to kill it. But what if I eat it? You won't! You won't! Okay. Okay, fine. Fine. - Awesome, can't wait to hear it. - Thank you. Thanks so much. Okay. So, Ricky's gonna do a pun-off. - Put me down as Lingo Starr. - I love it. Chad, you're going to wow us with some thespianism, right? - That's the plan. - Awesome. Ty? Uh, I thought I'd stage manage. Help out with the behind-the-scenes stuff. Come on! You've gotta do something up there. You're so talented. He's only good at soccer as far as we know. He does have some talent. Exactly! And this is your chance to show everyone how very talented you are, and also charismatic. So, think about it, please? - Okay, yeah, I'll think about it. - Yes! All right. Jordan? I'll be performing an Argentine tango. - Oh. - An Argentine tango. Correct. I can finally tell you my sister watches a little too much Dancing with the Stars. A, That is a lie. B, please put me down for an Argentine tango. You do realize it takes two human beings to tango, right? Put me down as “Jordan and TBD.” Okay. Uh, Franksie? Me? No. This is for you guys. I'm not gonna get involved. - What? Are you kidding? - Come on, man. Really? - You have to help us out. - Do it. - Are you sure? - Yes, we're sure. All right. I'll think of something. "All the world's a stage." "The end." Right? Is that what it is? I don't know. I have work to do, guys. Two-forty, 260, 280, 300. Okay, you know the school can help foot the bill for this. There's this discretionary fund for students in need. Okay, but I'm not in need. I am flush. All right. One ticket to Pittsburgh, coming right up. Carnegie Mellon will not know what hit them. What's going on? They found out. Who found out? Who do you think? I got fired. Good riddance. You're drunk. I got fired. I got fired. I had two drinks. I'm not drunk. How did they find out? I don't know. Did you say something? Did we leave something behind? It doesn't matter. They found out. Who was that? Oliver's coming to pick us up. I can't believe you. Amber! Hey. Yeah. I know. I'm sorry. We'll just sit here. No, no, no. My backpack. I had my money in there. My school books. My dad's hoodie. It's all gone. It's okay. Hey, it's okay. No, it's not. I don't know what to do, Ty. My mom's gonna be looking for me, and I can't go back to Oliver's. Let's just... Let's think about this, okay? Today's Saturday. We don't have school on Monday.

I should have told you. She's just a friend, Mom. Nobody's going to be partying up here, we're gonna be practicing. "Feels Like Home." My dad wrote it. He was... an amazing musician. And singer.

It was a heart thing. Never even knew anything was wrong with it. My mom tried to keep it together. She just didn't have any family around. So little by little, things started to go downhill. When we got evicted, we moved in with Oliver. First night we got there, they went out drinking. She'd been sober for five months. Then one night, he hit her. And we moved out, to the bus. We're going to figure something out, all right? Yeah. Yeah. Good morning! It's pretty nice, huh? No. What's so funny? Thanks. This has been really great. Anytime. You sure about this? Yeah. I trust Donna. Oh, hey, Amber. Ricky's over at Chad and Jordan's practicing for the Variety Show. Yeah, I actually came to see you. Okay. I need to tell you something. I don't understand what's going on here. We just want to discuss some things with you, Becky. Well, I, uh, came here to pick up my daughter, because she was missing all weekend and I was worried sick, and I don't really want to discuss anything with you. So, Amber, let's go. Don't look at her. What are you looking at her for? Amber wants you to know she doesn't feel comfortable living at Oliver's. Oh. So you two talked about everything, huh? Well, it may not be comfortable, but that is where we live now. I don't wanna live there again. I don't feel safe. You felt safer living on a bus? I just think... I don't care what you think. Amber, let's go. Donna says I can stay here for a few nights, until we figure this out. No. Absolutely not. No. - It's okay, Becky. - No, it's not. Who... Who do you think you are? Really? It is not okay. She is my daughter. She stays with me. - Calm down. - I am calm. I'm not going anywhere with you until you move out of Oliver's. If you keep her here, I'm calling the cops. Well, maybe that's not a bad idea. Maybe we all need to have a conversation about this. I'm the mother. I'm the one that keeps things together. Really, Mom? You do that? I had no idea. I'm trying. Can't you... You can't see that I'm trying to take care of you? I'm doing my best. Well, your best isn't good enough. Okay. Then stay here. Stay here for the rest of your life for all I care. Mom! Mom! Don't go back there. Please? Then where do I go? What am I supposed to do? You need help. And we can get you help. We can start over. "Start over." Life is so much more complicated than you think, baby. You got everything you need? - Yeah. - Okay. I'm really sorry for putting you in the middle of all this. Hey, no. You have nothing... nothing to be sorry about. Just... try to get some rest, okay? Okay. Good night. Good night, Donna. The Executive Branch had three departments. There was the Department of State, which was led by Thomas Jefferson. There was the Department of Treasury, which was led by... Hey. I need to speak with Amber. Oh, sure. Uh, Amber? Ooh! Okay, that's enough. Amber, bring your things. Have a seat. Amber, this is Officer Rozick and Officer Garland. I know what this is about. My mom called, right? I'll be right outside. Amber, your mother, Rebecca Appleton, was involved in an automobile accident early this morning. We're sorry to have to tell you, but she died of her injuries on the way to the hospital. Amber, do you have any friends or relatives you can stay with tonight? Yeah. Okay. We'll need to contact them. We also need you to come with us to answer a few questions. Was she driving? She was the passenger. The driver... also died in the collision. Did anyone else get hurt? It was a single-vehicle accident. He was drunk. Oliver. He was drunk, right? They both were. The cause of the accident is still being investigated. I'm sorry. I need to use the bathroom. That's why I think it makes more sense if Leah comes after. Right. And then I follow. - That works. - Yeah. What do you think, Amber? Hmm? Should I go before or after Leah's juggling act? Uh, it's... Whatever you guys want. - After's fine. - Yeah. Yeah, that'd be good. When a verb ends in a silent "e," drop the "e" and add "ed" to form the past tense. "Joke" to "joked." "Hope" to "hoped." Aren't we going to sing, Amber? No. Not today. Oh, but we love singing. Sorry. I bet you're sick of people asking you if you're okay. I ran away from her. I went to your fancy vacation house. I had fun while she needed me. Amber... this is not your fault. Then I came back, and I pushed her away. This is on me. Hey. Ready for Pittsburgh tomorrow? Yeah, sure. Listen, I can only imagine how hard it is for you right now. But... you know, your talent, the reason you earned this opportunity, that's still there. That doesn't go away. It's still in here. So, the pain that you're feeling, you know, the grief... I think you just... just channel it. Channel it, put it into your song. Because that's what an artist does. And you... You're an artist. Thank you, Mr. Franks. You have to finish your food, you can't just stare at it. So your flight's at nine. I figured we'd leave for the airport at 7:00 a.m. the latest, maybe even 6:30. And, um, you're all set up for the dorm and the student is gonna show you around. Yeah. You have enough money for the cab? Yeah, I'm good. Bobby? Bobby. No, no, no. How is he? Bobby has a mass on his spleen. That's what's been causing his discomfort. A mass? Is that cancer? I don't know yet. But either way, the treatment is exactly the same... We'll need to do surgery to remove the mass. If that's successful, he could make a full recovery. Amber, where have you been? You missed your flight. Is everything okay? No. So that's twelve dollars an hour. Uh, and the most I could work is a ten-hour shift? And overtime is time-and-a-half. Okay, thank you, Lloyd. I appreciate it. How's he feeling? I gave him another painkiller. Well, um, I explained everything to the Admissions Office, and they were very understanding. I think they can get you another audition slot. I'm not going. Amber, if it's about the plane ticket, - you don't have to... - I can't audition, Donna. Not until Bobby gets better. Lloyd has hired Amber full-time at the donut shop. Also, she added to her hours at the retirement home. If she works 70 hours a week at minimum wage, she could pay for Bobby's surgery in ten-and-a-half weeks. You can't work 70 hours a week and go to school. I'm dropping out. Dropping out? Amber, honey. No, you can't do that, you can't throw everything away. Donna, I really appreciate everything you've done... It's not about that. It's about you and your future. You have so much to look forward to, and so much talent. I can't let you... Stop! You're not her. You're not who? What's going on? You can't just drop out of school. Ty, look, I am so tired. I just can't right now. Look, I'm really sorry about Bobby. He's awesome. And I know that he's really important to you, but... Don't. Don't say he's just a dog. Because he's not. Not to me. Okay. You need money, right? Let me help you. I can ask my parents. - I'm handling it. - Listen to me, it can be a loan. Okay? You can pay them back slowly while you finish school... Ty, stop! I have this under control. Damn it, Amber, you are so stubborn! You do so much for other people, but when you need just a little bit of help, you push us all away. What is so bad about needing help? Like, if you don't do this on your own, you're weak? Good job, Ty, you figured it out. I bet part of you is glad that you missed the audition. Bobby got sick, and you got an excuse to punish yourself for letting your mom down, which you didn't do. You're suffering. You're suffering, and you won't admit it. You expect the rest of us to sit by and watch you go down the drain, and that is not fair! "Not fair?" I'm sorry, that must really suck, life not being fair. You know what you should do to make yourself feel better? I don't know, you should hang out with your two parents at your vacation home. Maybe that'll help you get over life and its vast unfairness. - Amber... - Leave me alone! Just leave me alone. Thank you. Take the rack, both sides in, and you slowly... drop them into the oil.

In fact, if you happen to see the old Amber, well, you can tell her that... it was a living hell just being around her. All that disgusting cheer and helpfulness. Optimism. Well, she was insufferable. Hey. Hi. I can't go. You've been putting this show on for the last three years. It's the last one you'll ever get to see. It's your night. Sorry.

Okay. All right. Yeah. Um... We ended up changing the... We ended up changing the proceeds to going to Bobby Big Boy's surgery. - What? - I know. Yeah, I know. Look, before you... before... Before this gets out of hand, I want to say something. I want to say that I'm sorry. Okay? I want to say that I'm sorry about the other... Well, you know, I was... I was way too hard on you. I was frustrated. I was frustrated because I care about you... a lot. All of these people care about you. They showed up for you. Okay? So for once, you're gonna have to deal with that, all right? What if I don't know how? Think of it as a gift. Okay? Think of it as a gift that you're giving us by letting us help you. Amber. Trust us. We won't let you down. Just over here. Hi, Bobby. Hi, Bobby. Have a seat, the show's about to start. Where are you going to sit? Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the "Save Bobby Big Boy" Variety Show! Now, we have some amazing acts lined up for you tonight. But before we get to those, I wanted to make a few opening remarks. As we all know, Amber Appleton puts together this Variety Show every year to raise money for various school causes. She's also helped the Drama Club mount their productions, has lobbied the school board for better wheelchair access, and has made me countless delicious fried-egg sandwiches. She teaches, she volunteers. She's... sorta like a rock star. Just by being here tonight, she has helped me get over my... my massive, massive stage fright. Honestly, I don't know, maybe. I still might throw up, we'll see. Now... even though it's really tough for her to admit, Amber needs us. Our goal tonight is to raise $8,000, so that her dog, Bobby Big Boy, can get a life-saving operation. We have raised over $2,000 in ticket sales alone so far. So, please, get out your phones and tweet, Instagram, Facebook, live stream, anything you can to help get the word out. So, let's get to our first act. Whoo! Do you bite your thumb at me, sir. I do bite my thumb, sir. Do you bite your thumb at me, sir? No, sir. I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I do bite my thumb, sir. - Do you quarrel, sir? - Quarrel, sir? Draw, if you be men. Yes, Jordan! All right, let's refresh our page and see where we are. Yes, we're getting there. Please, keep spreading the word. Next up, we have the punniest man alive. Give it up for Ricky Lingo Starr Roberts! I'm here to talk to you about man's best friend. Well, one man's best friend. Mine. She's a human woman. Not a dog... but she's got a great one in Bobby Big Boy. Things lately, they got a little ruff for these two, but we're here to give triple-B a new leash on life. I can say Lapso-lutely amazing things about Amber, but you all might Terrier your hair out. And I don't want Amber to sit there and Rottweiler friends Schnauzer off in front of everyone. So embarrassed of all the Shih Tzu here, that she Pekingese eyes out from behind her hands. I'll keep things Pug-ressing for a Spaniel be able to handle, and then Retriever. Amber... you Mastiff known I would take this speech, and Basset on the fact that you're a Great Dane... and my best friend in the whole world. Aww... Thank you. All right, let's take another look at where we are. Almost $6,000. Yes. Let's keep those pledges coming in. And now, for our last act of the night, ladies and gentlemen, the Korean Divas, accompanied by our very own McKinley High marching band, and their brand new tuba.

Okay, let's take another look. Six thousand, three hundred and four dollars. Wow. I'd like to thank all the acts, everybody who contributed. It's been an awesome night. Thank you so, so much. Now, we didn't quite make our goal, but we'll keep the page open. So please keep spreading the word. No. Everybody, our guest of honor, Amber Appleton! Wow. Uh... This is overwhelming. I'm not... a hundred percent sure this is happening yet. - Whoo! - Um... But I'm so happy that the marching band got their tuba. Hope is the thing with feathers. My mom loved that poem. We'd read it at bedtime for... as long as I can remember. It's about finding hope, even in the darkest of times. My mom always had hope, and so did I. Until I lost it. But you all helped me find it again. I don't know how to repay you. But I guess that's the point. I don't have to repay you. I just have to take the gift that you've given me and use it. And I will. So, thank you. I'm so grateful. Should we take one last look at our total? Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Do it! Is this a joke? Um, can we get a refresh on that, please? I think it's real. Ty, did you... No! No. I promise you, I had nothing... I don't know. Then... Looks like we got an anonymous donation of $200,000, bringing our total to $206,844. Hi, Mr. Linder. It's me, Amber Appleton. Do you remember me? Are we related? No, I work here on the weekends, but I had some extra donuts, so I thought I'd stop by. You want one? Hmm. What's this? Well, just open it. Oh, for God's sake, it's not a bomb. Open it. Told you I'd make you cry. Joan... No. Yes. What am I supposed to do with all that dough, huh? Line my coffin with it? I don't have any family left. Well, that's not exactly true. Actually, you're my family. And you can make better use of it than anyone else I know. Oh... Oh, God, no. No more waterworks. I only wanted to see it the one time.
