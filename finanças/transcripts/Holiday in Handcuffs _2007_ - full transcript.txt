MY FIRM DID SOME LEGAL WORK FOR YOU ON THE PINEHURST CONDOS. OH, OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THERE? I'M A VICE PRESIDENT OF NEW BUSINESS. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A TIME WE THOUGHT TRUDIE, WITH ALL HER CAUSES, MIGHT GO TO LAW SCHOOL LIKE HER SISTER KATIE. BEING A DEMOCRAT IS NOT A CAUSE, DAD. BUT SHE GOT HER DEGREE IN LIBERAL ARTS. FINE ARTS, DAD. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. IT'S AN EXPENSIVE WAY TO SAY, "DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT?" [chuckling] OH, HOMEMADE ORNAMENTS. YEAH, TRUDIE MADE THAT WHEN SHE WAS FIVE. SHE WAS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN AS A CHILD. OKAY, MOM. YOU KNOW, HER BROTHER AND SISTER ARE SO OUTGOING AND HAD SO MANY FRIENDS. BUT TRUDIE WAS--I DON'T KNOW-- A LITTLE ANTISOCIAL. REALLY? WE EVEN PAID A LITTLE BOY DOWN THE STREET TO BE HER FRIEND, BUT HE GAVE US OUR MONEY BACK. ALL RIGHT! SO FROM THEN ON IT WAS TRUDIE AND HER PROJECTS. AND OF COURSE BOBO BLONKERS. BOBO BLONKERS? HER IMAGINARY FRIEND. THANKS, MOM. THANKS A LOT. WHAT? WHAT WAS THAT? ARE YOU TALKING TO BOBO BLONKERS RIGHT NOW? I HAVE AN IDEA. WHY DON'T WE LET NICK PUT THE ANGEL UP ON THE TREE THIS YEAR?

I MEAN, THIS IS MY MOMENT. YOU KNOW, IT'S TRADITION. DOES ANYONE CARE ABOUT THAT ANYMORE? TRUDIE, WHAT'S WRONG WITH STARTING A NEW TRADITION? NICK, UP THE TREE. OH, THANKS. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. YEAH. HEY, THERE SHE IS. [all shouting and laughing] WOO! [all cheering] (David) WOW, THIS IS REALLY A GREAT PLACE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE CRAFTSMANSHIP THAT GOES INTO A CABIN LIKE THIS.

AND MY MOM PUT LIGHTS IN ALL THE TREES IN THE BACKYARD. OH, THE GLOW WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. AND IT WAS SO QUIET. AND THAT CHRISTMAS EVE, I SKATED MY LITTLE ROUTINE WITH MY PARENTS WATCHING. IT WAS LIKE I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD. THEY WERE SO PROUD OF ME. BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY THINGS CHANGED, AND I JUST...WISH THEY STILL FELT THAT WAY ABOUT ME, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW, I THINK PARENTS WANT THE BEST FOR THEIR KIDS. BUT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. WE SHOULD PROBABLY HIDE THE EVIDENCE.

AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE ON YOUR HONEYMOON OR SOMETHING? OKAY, HOW ABOUT I TAKE THAT BLINDFOLD OFF NOW? HUH? HOW'D THAT BE? WOW. WHERE ARE WE? TRUDIE, YOU ARE... UNORGANIZED, AND PUSHY, AND CRAZY. I KNOW, AND I'M WORKING ON THOSE THINGS. AND IF YOU'LL JUST LISTEN TO ME-- AND YOU TALK TOO MUCH. OKAY. I LOST A LOT BECAUSE OF YOU. BUT I'VE REALIZED THAT I DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE THINGS. WAIT. YOU DON'T? EVERYTHING I WANT... IS RIGHT HERE. MARTIN ART AND ARCHITECTURE. A GALLERY AND A STUDIO. WOW. IT'S AMAZING. AND I'VE JUST ACQUIRED MY FIRST PIECE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THAT'S A FIRST. I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE STRIVING FOR THINGS THAT I DIDN'T EVEN WANT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. I THOUGHT I HAD SOMETHING TO PROVE. BUT I DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING TO ANYONE ANYMORE. YOU DON'T? WELL... MAYBE ONE MORE THING. CAN YOU TAKE THESE OFF ME NOW? (Trudie) THERE MAY BE NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT JOB, A PERFECT FAMILY, OR A PERFECT LIFE. BUT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A PERFECT MOMENT. SO I TAKE BACK WHAT I SAID. DOING ONE CRAZY THING PROBABLY DOES MAKE YOU CRAZY, BUT IT CAN ALSO MAKE YOU HAPPY.
