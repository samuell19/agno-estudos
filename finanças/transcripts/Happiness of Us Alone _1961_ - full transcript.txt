Run! Akiko! Lady! Lady! Lady... I can't hear. Lady. Oh, how cute the country girl Chasing her favorite birdie, Swinging her bird cage to and fro Swinging her bird cage to and fro... What're you going to do with that kid? Shinetsu, take the kid and leave him somewhere. Let me have him. Hey! Give him to me! The family of the Ryukoji Temple? Yes. Your temple was partly saved. 12345 people. 6 people, including the kid. The kid? She found him somewhere. That boy is lucky to be with a priest's family. I'd like to stuff myself for once, even if it's on pumpkins. A fine day it is! I hear a new type of bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. We're evacuating to a place beyond the Itoi River. Oh? Itoi is in Niigata Prefecture, right? That's right. - Have one, please. - Thanks. How nice. You can eat all the rice you want. But a craftsman can't do farm work. We'll just be in the way if we go. Is your husband going too? The munitions factory burned down. No reason for him to stay. Please have some. Tea's ready, Shinetsu! Please have some. Who's that boy? I hope she doesn't believe the kid is her own. Where did she find him? I haven't the faintest idea what she thinks. Deaf people must be different from the rest of us. What would you do with that kid? Children are a nation's treasures. Surely we can't abandon him. (Emperor's voice) ...the war has lasted almost four years. Despite the best efforts of everyone - the gallant fighting of military and naval forces, the diligence of our government, and the devoted service of our one hundred million people, the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against Japan's interest. Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is indeed incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. If we continue to fight... What's going on? Sshh! Sshh! Also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization. Such being the case, how are we to save the millions of our subjects, or to atone ourselves before the hallowed spirits of our imperial ancestors? For this reason we have ordered the acceptance of... the provisions of the Joint Declaration of the Powers. We cannot but express the deepest sense of regret to our allied nations of East Asia, who have consistently cooperated with the Empire towards the emancipation of East Asia. The thought of those officers and men as well as... others who have fallen in the fields of battle... A National Repentance I feel so itchy! My back! Right here! Here! Please don't kill the turtle. It's for Akira. Did he wet his bed again? Hiroko, bring the boy here. His name tag's in Akiko's sewing box. Bring both to me. Okay. What are you going to do? I'm leaving him with the police. You should be the one to do this. But Akiko's not here now. Akiko? Always thinking of Akiko! There's no need for us to be so nice to her anymore. Her folks are dirt poor after their house burned down. They're not our patrons anymore. She's right. It's a pity, but... he's not the only war orphan. Akira Ueno born May 9, 1942 Understood. We will take steps to put him in an orphanage. Thank you. I'm cold. Welcome home. Thanks. You must have been cold. Look at this! Oh... take a look. Such a nice pumpkin! Where's Akira? Akira! Akira! Your father took him to the police station. Oh? No use in keeping him here. Lay out my bed. I'm pooped! I'll go to bed right after I eat. I'm so cold! Maybe you caught a cold? Akira! Akira! I'll go. Akira! Nevermind Akira. Your husband just collapsed! I'll get a doctor. You hurry and stay by his side! I'm cold! Wait. I'll prepare the heater. Put more covers on him! Get rid of that thing! Hurry and put the rice away. The doctor will be here. Akira! Akira! I'm cold! We must be cautious with typhus disease. Typhus can wipe out entire families. Be sure to boil their clothing. Report anyone who has a fever. Sit down. Did Shinetsu die? He was taken to the hospital. What about the rest of the family? You want me to take back Akiko, you say? We mean you no hardship, but the world has changed. Akiko is still young. It is far worse for a widow like her to... spend her life in a run-down temple. The world has certainly changed. Never in my life have I heard of a widow... sent home so soon after her husband's passing. But a member of our family may be repatriated... and return home at any moment. A person like Akiko... You said you'd accept her handicap! Well, yes but... I've had enough. Complaining will only make me look pitiful. I thank you for taking care of Akiko. I will take Akiko home with me today. Sister. She was sent home, just like I told you. Even normal people don't have enough to eat nowadays. So help her. She's your sister. Sister, it's been awhile. I hate her voice. How about it, for 30,000 yen? You're really going to do it? Of course. Parachutes have no use now. I'll buy them cheap and make lingerie. And that's not all. With a truck, I could... Mother, let's sell our land. We don't earn a single yen off of it. I won't sell it for any price! First of all, it's registered in Akiko's name. I'll look after her for the rest of her life. She'd lose it paying taxes anyhow. I won't do it. You talk to her yourself. Forget it. It's a waste of time talking to her. I can't get her to understand anything. Sister, Sister... Sister! Forget it. Good night. Thank you. Give me nylon socks, tomorrow. Okay. What are you doing? School for the Deaf and Mute Alumni Reunion Your husband passed away last winter. I am very sorry for you. My name is... Michio Katayama. I have known about you for a long time. Because my friend and you... had an arranged marriage meeting. I hoped that you would marry him, but you married a temple priest. My friend died in an air-raid. I didn't know. lam sorry to hear that. You must be lonely without your friend. Excuse me. For you. Thank you. What are you doing now? I sold sweet potatoes on the black market until last month. But few people bought them, so I quit. If I had a sewing machine, I'd like to become a dressmaker. But it's very expensive, so I can't buy one. My friend sells secondhand furniture. He may have a cheap one. I'll ask him. Please do. When did you lose your hearing? When I was three, I ate too many soybeans and got sick. I had a really high fever. I lost my hearing at that time. I was five before my parents... noticed that I was deaf. The warrior Hideyoshi didn't speak until he was seven, so my parents thought I'd become a great leader as well. They were so surprised when they found out I was deaf. My grandfather had poor hearing. I guess mine is caused by heredity. When I looked at your eyes, right away I knew that you're a very nice person. I work at a foundry now. I have no family. I'm all alone. My family all died in the war. Only a deaf and mute guy like me was left. We must keep on living, no matter how rough it gets. You think so? Please be my friend, Akiko. Same here. I hope we'll be good friends. He lives with his uncle, and works at a factory in Shibuya. He's five years older than me. His salary is 1300 yen. Get a load of that... when even normal people have trouble surviving. What's wrong with that? She's trying her best, without bearing a grudge. Of course not. She'd only have a grudge against you and Father. A telegram for you. A telegram? Thank you. Akiko Shinoda. Akiko, it's for you. For me? I want to see you. Waiting at Ueno, 1 p.m. tomorrow. Michio Katayama. Who's Michio Katayama? Who is he? The man I told you about. The man you met at the reunion today? What a riot! Your kind are so passionate. "I want to see you." Give me that. With lips drawn, Stop it! Looking silently at the blue sky. Sister! Nobuko! Stop it! Have pity on her! People like her are in need of friends. Why don't you get a boyfriend for yourself? I will never marry! That's your choice. But you shouldn't be jealous of her. Jealous? Me? Give me a break. I'll tell you straight. Nobody will marry me because of her! What are you saying, Nobuko? It's your fault. You're her mother. I hate both of you! I'll never come home again! Nobuko! Nobuko! Nobuko! Ueno Zoo This zoo has no animals. They were a danger during the war and had to be put to sleep. Please have these. These are for you. For me? How nice. Let's have one each. Both are for you. Thank you. Can I eat one now? No, they're raw eggs. Raw? Have them for dinner when you get home. After today... I can't see you often. Why not? My sister ran away from home. My mother must go out to work. So I must take care of things at home. Will you marry me, Akiko? I wanted to propose to you sooner. But I was too afraid to ask. Though I have no money or home, I promise I will make you happy. Please marry me. No, I can't. It isn't right. You don't like me? It's not that don't like you. But... my first marriage was a failure. That doesn't matter. I've been in love with you ever since we first met. I'm sure you'll find someone better than me. No, there's only you. Yes, you will. I... Early on, my plan was to never marry. I had many arranged marriage meetings, but I turned down every offer. I know. When I heard a temple priest was interested, I first turned him down. But Mother was so happy. She thought a normal person would never marry someone like me. Our family was a big supporter of their temple. Perhaps they expected to receive a large dowry. Was your husband good to you? Was it rude of me to propose? Please, please marry me. You are a good person. I believe in you. But I must talk this over with my mother. I will always be waiting. Stop! Stop! Wait! Hey! You with the bag, I said to stop! Take my place. He's pretending he can't hear. He didn't pay? Why didn't you stop when I told you to? Show me your ticket. You won't mess with me! I'll take you on! Why you! What're you doing? You're both deaf? We must help each other in order to survive. Will you help me for the rest of my life? I will do anything for you. People like us cannot survive alone. We must help each other and... not lose out to normal people. Thank you. Thank you. What's the matter? The eggs. Both of them broke. They're a mess. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry or you'll miss the train. Hurry! Yes. Welcome. "We are unable to hear." "Please help us during our stay." Yes. I have heard about it. We brought two days worth of rice. Please speak slowly on. Write down on paper I understand. I am finished now. Please enjoy your stay. I'm surprised. When did you write these? Yesterday, with Mother. Thanks. You were a big help. Are you tired? No, I'm not. I feel sorry for you. When I tripped at the shrine... I remembered my late husband and had an awful feeling. At the wedding ceremony together with you, It was my second. But it was your first, and I feel very sorry for you. Don't worry about it. We are now husband and wife, so let's get along and be happy together. Please look after me. What are you reading? A manga. What are you writing? Akiko Katayama Akiko Katayama Do you like children? Yes, I do. Shall we have children? How do you feel about it? I'd like to have children. Just one. Please let us have one child. What will you do if the child is born deaf? Let's think it over more carefully. I'm certain our child will hear. I believe it. With only one child, even people like us can... raise him just as well as normal people could. A news flash At 2:30 p.m. today, General MacArthur... made the following announcement. As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, while union leaders call for a general strike... Thanks. I am Mrs. Katayama. I have just moved here. As I am deaf] please help me out. I see. Half a radish, please. Oh? You can talk. One, please. One? Alright. Welcome. Wait! Deaf lady! Fool. She can't hear you. She's deaf. Deaf but quick. Must be dangerous going out. Welcome back. How are you? How is Sister? She sent me a letter from Kobe. I don't know what she's doing now. And Koichi only talks big. You're the happiest one. What brings you here today? I'd like your advice. I'm going to have a baby. You... You shouldn't be happy about it. Having a baby isn't right. Before you married, didn't you promise... not to have a baby? Don't you remember? Even normal people can barely get by. Now listen to me, Akiko. Give up having a baby. See a doctor. I'll go with you. You know how much I suffered in raising you. Even normal parents have a hard time... raising normal children. Don't make life even more difficult for yourselves. Do you understand? Don't have the baby. Don't have it. What's the matter? How much will it cost? ...to have a baby. I can have my baby? I really can? The ears? The baby's ears? Not yours! The baby's! Akiko! We're so happy. It was hard, wasn't it? Mother, how are the baby's ears? He can hear! Of course he can! Don't worry. See, he's crying, in a big loud voice. You can feel his voice in your hand, can't you? "January 18, 1948" Mother was right after all. I wish he hadn't been born. I killed my baby. Let's go. We can have another baby. No, we won't have another! I killed him. My poor, poor baby! It's not only your fault. We must work harder at it than normal parents. We must put forth all we've got into living. Mr. Katayama? Something happened? Are you able to talk, Madam? Please speak slowly. I am deaf. The factory your husband worked at burned down last night. Where were you last night? Afire! Your factory burned down! Yes. Hurry up. That's enough. Don't just stand there. Hurry up! Employment Office Shoeshine! Shoeshine! Hey there! May I? Come on! Shoeshine! Shoeshine! Tightwad! Japanese are no good! Hey lady. A shoeshine, Mister? I'll shine your shoes. Sir! Teacher! I just knew it was you, Akiko. It's been a long time. Yes, it's been a long time. How have you been? I'm fine. This is my husband. Is that so? I'm happy to hear that. Nice to meet you. She is Ms. Okawa from the school for the deaf. When did you get married? Two years ago. We met at an alumni meeting in Shinagawa. After talking and spending time together we fell in love. I see. No baby yet? Yes, we're going to have a baby this fall. Is that true? It's true. I never lie. Congratulations. You're a meanie. Why didn't you let me know sooner? You must quit shining shoes. Don't worry. You must have a strong, healthy baby. I'll work harder. We can't make ends meet on what you earn alone, not after we have the baby. I'll work day and night. Don't worry. You must eat a lot. You must have milk to feed the baby. It's too early for that. We have a visitor. Mother! I'm sorry for coming so suddenly. Koichi sold our house and ran away. The new owner is going to tear it down today. I have no place to stay. Mother lost her home. No home? Then let's have her stay here with us. It's safer for the baby, too. I'm going to have a baby, Mother. Please stay here and help us. Hello. Hey, come on. Hey! Hey! Let me shine your shoes. Thank you. Come on. Very good. How much? That's okay. Shoeshine! Shoeshine! How about a shoeshine? Did something happen? What's going on? He shined 72 pairs of American boots! Americans? Wow. They gave you this? I see. Ah! Ichiro can hear. He looked this way! You're doing it again? Mother, he can hear. Of course he can. That's all you do every day. And we have no money. Did the shop lend you some vegetables? Look. I'm hungry. Please cook them now. You two drive me crazy. Don't you know how little money is left? Six yen. But we can get more if we work. Yes, but... Even normal people wouldn't be so laid-back about it. You're a funny couple. You must be sick of working day and night. Hello. Yes? I'm here to collect the money you owe for shoyu. Sorry. I'll have it for you tomorrow. Don't even have 30 yen? What did he say? Nothing at all. A fine item. But hairpieces are out of fashion. If this were a ring, I'd offer you 30,000 yen. I will accept your previous offer. Once let go, you'll never own a gem like this again. May I see your rice-ration ID book? Yes. What about the rest of the money? A trumpet. You bought a trumpet? How much did you make today? 240 yen. You spent 200 yen out of 240 yen on a trumpet? I thought Ichiro would be happy. We have no money left. It's more important to buy milk than a toy. Don't you understand? I'm the one who earned that money. His ears are more important than milk. A sewing machine! Mother, a sewing machine! Thank you, Mother. I didn't want to buy the machine. It's like I'm asking you to work harder. No, I'm very happy. Ah! 3rd prize goes to Ichiro Katayama. Over here! He won. 3rd prize! Yes. 3rd Prize Certificate Ichiro Katayama We won because of your help, Mother! Thank you very much. The hard part is yet to come. Only one thing worries me. When he grows older, won't the kids tease him... because his parents are deaf? You lost your hearing because of an illness. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Bring him up well, so that no one can say... it's the fault of his deaf parents. I will quit my job as a shoeshiner and find better work. When our first child died, I wanted to die, too. I didn't think I'd ever be happy without him. I hope our son will grow up fast. Ichiro. Let me hold him. Spring, 1955 Hey, Michio! Hey! Time sure flies. Ichiro begins kindergarten this year? A present for Ichiro. Congratulations Ichiro on Entering School ...right on the concrete wall. Ichiro plays very rough. I'm sorry, Kazuo. I won't let him off next time. Here it is, Grandma. It cost 95 yen. I'll keep the 5 yen change. Ichiro! Wait. ♪ A pine spreading its branches over the black board fence ♪ There stands a fine figure, hair let down ♪ You were supposed to be dead, Miss Otomi ♪ Even the gods don't know you're still alive Welcome home. Welcome home, Father. What's this? It's a present from his uncle. From Uncle? They're Tombow Pencils. What a nice gift! You must study hard. School begins tomorrow. Who will go with you? I'll take him. I'll go with Grandma. You can stay home. Why? Because. You won't let me go? You don't understand. But I do understand. No, you don't. I'm going with Grandma! He's become such a naughty boy because... you never scold him. He got into a fight today. I didn't fight! Then why did Kazuo cry? I don't know! Why can't you be an honest boy? Ichiro! I hate you, Mother! Ichiro! Ichiro! Ichiro! Ichiro! Our son never cries. "Kosuge Prison" (Investigating Official) You have not been acquitted of charges. Your sister has become your guarantor. If you do not reform your conduct, you will get her into trouble. You understand? I'm sorry, Akiko. We cause you so much trouble. Run away! Wait! I'll get you! Take that! And that! Call me a deaf's child again and I'll beat you up even more! Koichi! Koichi! I'm amazed how you loaf around the house every day. Just like a fish. Fish... that's right. What's a pain in the neck and starts with a "G"? That's you. Good-for-nothing. Ah, that's it. I wish you had stayed in jail longer. Me too. At least I'd have food to eat. At least work enough to pay for your food. You're young and able. I can't work if... there's no job for me. No one is going to beg you to work for them. Get off my back and be quiet! I've been waiting for you. When did they let you out? About a month ago. Let's talk outside. Who is he? I don't know... It's about time to go and get him? I will go. It's too bad you missed each other along the way. Thank you very much. Please ask me again. Do you want to try to turn a suit inside out? We're not in a rush. Yes, sir. "First Grader magazine" I'm home! I'm home. Welcome home. Grandma, give me 10 yen. If it's for candy, ask your mother. I want to see a picture show. Could there be something nice on your desk? I read it already. It was so boring. Your mother bought for you. Which bookstore? The one next to the bike shop? Go and exchange it for a manga, will you? That magazine is boring. The picture show is here. Give me 10 yen! No! 5 yen. No. Go study. Stingy! Forget about it. Mother. Mother, I wish I never had a child. What are you saying? I can't scold him when he's bad, or praise him as... an ordinary mother would. I can't help him with his schoolwork. I can't understand much of what you two talk about. I might be to blame. I'm useful because I can hear. How nice it would be if children never grew up. I felt that way too, when you were small. That's not what I meant. When Ichiro was small and I carried him on my back, he would tap my back to tell me a car was approaching. Nowadays, he runs away when he sees me. If only I could hear, If only I could hear, I could become a better mother. Hey, the deaf guy is here to collect his debt. Tell him I'm not here. Let's stop for a while? He's deaf. He can't hear us. "Is Koichi inside?" He's out. As today is payday, I must take home the money I lent him. Please return it. I don't know anything. What're trying to do? Eat raw eggs for strength. He's out. He's not here! I said he's not here! Now go home! A standing hand. How about this move? Hey, a triple. A hit. It's a hit. What a pest! Loading is illegal. What're you saying? Where's this month's pay? Didn't you get paid today? I was paid. Then where is it? I lost it. Where? I don't know. In the train? After you got off? I don't know. Ichiro, dinner's ready. Fish again? Be quiet and eat. I hate fish. Buy some eggs. I want raw eggs. Then don't eat it. Eat only the pickles. Any sauce? I don't like kids who complain about their food. So don't eat. I won't. What's going on? Such angry looks. Sardines again today, Grandma. Mother, he lost his pay. Lost it? All of it? Don't eat it, grandma. It's sardines. Be quiet and eat! What a problem. Did he report it to the police? Did you report it to the police? He'll never the get money back in these times. I will start work as a maid from tomorrow. I just decided. Our neighbor, Mrs. Sakurai, helped me find the job. No need to be upset over the money. Let's eat. Ichiro. Ichiro! Ichiro! I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Ichiro Katayama's mother. Yes, I know. Can you understand if I speak slowly? Yes. Have a seat. Please. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, very well. Please write if you don't understand. Ichiro won't talk at all about school. When I ask him about school or his friends, all he says is, later on. He won't tell me anything. What should I do? Well... He often fights with kids in the neighborhood. Does he fight at school too? Yes, he gets into many fights. The other day he made a 2nd grader cry. But the boy who teased Ichiro was at fault. What did he tease him about? Well... I'm not sure. I know why. It's because we're not normal parents. I try to be attentive. How can I raise him to be a good boy? Well... I spanked Ichiro a few days ago. Was it wrong for me to do it? How should I raise a child like Ichiro? Well... Mother! Hurry! You won this in a quiz contest. I took delivery for it since you were out. A radio! I won this? When did you send in the answers? Can you believe I won a radio when I'm deaf? A radio! A radio! What's playing now, Ichiro? Music. Do you understand? What's going on? I could hear from the street corner. You won a radio in a quiz contest? They're deaf and can still hear it? I'll get you! This way! We're going to see the teacher. Let me go! The fish's school, in the middle of the riven Take a peek, Have a look. Take a peek. Wait! Katayama! You peanut! Please don't fight anymore. I don't fight! Ichiro, friends are most important in life. A bad boy like you, doesn't have any friends. I have lots of friends! I've never seen you with even one friend. You'd play at their homes and they'd come to ours, if you had friends. I want to meet your friends. I don't want any friends! Huh? If it's about money, I won't listen. What? So you want to work when the others sleep? You mean, overtime? Ichiro, hurry and eat. If you don't hurry, the public bath will be crowded. Sshh! You still haven't finished your rice. Quiet! I'm listening to the radio. Summer vacation begins tomorrow. Just because it's your vacation, don't play too hard and worry your parents. It's good to go to the beach or to the mountains. Learning to build a healthy body is... an important part of your studies. You have your report card? You can see it for 10 yen. I have no money, so be satisfied with this. All 4 points. Oh, music is 3 points. The picture storyteller is here. Mother, give me 5 yen. Ichiro, no! Your dance shakes my hairdo. The storyteller is here! The storyteller is here! The storyteller is here! The storyteller is here! The storyteller is here! Mister, I went around for you. Thanks. You can watch for free. And my candy? Candy? You're a sharp kid. Do it again tomorrow. Sure. You can't stay here any longer. I said no. So you're telling me to steal or kill? I won't fall for that. I feel like killing you myself! Either I get 10,000 yen or it's handcuffs. Fine with me. Stay in jail forever. That look won't scare me. Michio and Akiko even work at night despite being deaf. Do you know how much they make each month? Normal people go on strike for higher pay, or grumble about their low pay. Yet they've never once complained. You make Michio loan you his pay... and take Akiko's money. You're the devil incarnate! Don't ever set foot here again! 10 yen in change. Someone dropped it. Where? Here. Whose is it? Madame, did you lose 500 yen? No. Can you find out who lost it? No. Hold onto it. Huh? If you don't find the owner by tomorrow... We'll divide it in half. You and me? She's shrewd. Mother. She can't hear, but has a good head on her shoulders. Heave-ho. What are you doing with my sewing machine? Lend it to me for one week. No! My sewing machine, give it back! Lend it to me. Uncle. Pedal to the metal! My sewing machine... No! My sewing machine! No! Ouch! No! My sewing machine... Mother! Mother! Dear Michio, I can no longer stay here. I can't raise our boy properly. And today, Koichi stole my sewing machine. Though you never complain, I cannot cause you any more trouble. Looking back, there was so much suffering, and so little joy each day. I will now go to Koichi's place. I will make him die with me. To Michio. Father! Father! Father! Father! Otsuka Station. Train on platform 1 bound for Tabata, Ueno, and Tokyo stations. Passengers getting on or off please be ready. Doors will now close. I read your letter. Please get off at the next station. Then I'll stay on with you. It is over for us. I feel as though we were born only to suffer. We can buy another sewing machine if we work hard. Though Koichi is trouble, what's done is done, as he's your brother. If he were my brother... I would suffer just as you are. I understand the pain you feel. We are married. Why must you suffer alone? Koichi once took money from you. But to protect him, you said you dropped it. Mother told me about it. Ever since we married, I have only caused you trouble. I never did anything for you. You are mistaken, Akiko. When we married, we vowed to help each other and live happily together. Have you forgotten our promise? We can't survive alone. We must help each other... and not lose out to normal people. Have you forgotten our promise? Shinsei cigarettes, please. Good evening. Did you bring the suit turned inside out? I'm sorry. Mother said it'll be ready tomorrow morning. Okay. Here's the pay for the last job. What's the matter? The neighbors are installing a gas line... from the main street to the corner. We all have to pay for it. A gas line is good to have. I know it's convenient. But we must pay 12,000 yen initially, and another 10,000 yen to draw the line into the house. They want payment right away. I wish I could earn a little more from sewing. You're being cheated by Mr. Sawano. You should find work with another tailor. That's easy for you to say, but... he's provided work for her a long time. Mother does fine work for little pay. That's how he makes money. Yes, but it's not that simple. Don't accept it. The harder she works, the more he makes. You're still paying for the sewing machine, aren't you? That's how life is. We can't change that. Mother and Father can't hear. That's why they get cheated. Mother and Father, and even Grandma, have to work. What are you so angry about? I said that you two always... lose out because you're deaf. What of it if they're cheated or lose out? What's important is that we're together, safe and healthy. You'll understand someday. Your parents have led honest and humble lives. That's how they've gotten by to this day. I have great respect for them. I feel badly for our neighbors, but we can't afford a gas line. It's alright. We can go without it for now. Thanks. Your mother is a big help. Her work is always done to a tee. Is my mother a good worker? Yes, very good. She's quick and precise. She could be a fine tailor if she studied. You want to become a tailor? You'd been in a bind without her, right? Well... I think her pay is too low. I think other tailors pay more. Mother works morning, noon, and night. Say what? Get out and go to school! You're not being fair. You're taking advantage of her because she's deaf. Why you! Quiet! You fool! Good evening. Good evening. Welcome. Please have a seat. Please give this to Ichiro. Thank you. I'm sorry about this morning, Ichiro. What happened? This morning Ichiro told me... to raise your pay. He said it was too low. Oh my. It's okay. I didn't realize it. I'll pay you more from now on. I'll ask you to sew again... often. Please do. I'm glad. I knew you would understand. See you. Goodbye. Mr. Sawano. I'm sorry I called you a fool. Don't worry about it. What did you say to Mr. Sawano? Hearing aids for those with difficulty hearing Hey. Will you be able to hear with that? Is it for you? Your auditory nerves are damaged. I'm sorry, but a hearing aid won't help you. I thought so. You seem to have a problem with your eyes. Her eyes? A lottery? Ten thousand yen? One million yen? I got it. Granny fainted when she found out... she won one-million yen. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! What's the matter, Mother? I'm sorry. I didn't know your friends were here. It's okay. I want to introduce them to you. So I brought them here. I'll stay next door... until they leave. Don't be silly. You wanted me to bring my friends over. Won't you be ashamed of me if I'm there? Don't be silly. Hello. Hello. This is my mother. She'll understand if you talk slowly. Suzuki. Kusakabe. Yamagishi. Yamaishi. Yamagishi. Yamaishi. It's "gi". Yamagishi. Yamagishi. Abe. Matsunaga. Welcome to our home. How about a snack? We just ate. They liked it, the bread crusts you fried. Shall I go out and buy them something? Later is okay. We're playing charades. I'm the best at it. Watch us play. Who's next? Who's next? Oh, I'm next. Forgetting your own turn! It's you. Ready? Okay. A woman? An animal? A dog? A cat? "A cat stole his fish. He fell on a banana peel chasing the cat." "He's angry. The fish peddler's angry." That's not fair! So it was you, Akiko! I thought you looked familiar. Long time no see. It's been a while. Please speak more slowly. So she was married to Shinetsu. Yes, she was. She picked up a baby during the air-raids. What happened to the baby? The one during the air-raids. You mean, Akira? Yes. We run an antique shop in Kyobashi. Stop by if you're in the area. I'll treat you to something. Understand? The son who took over the temple duties... What a rotten guy. You know the main Buddhist statue? He sold it and ran off with a barmaid. Speaking of bars, You have a sister named, Nobuko, right? She works at a bar in West Ginza. You talk too fast. She can't understand you. She's deaf. Right. Your sister... My sister? I don't know where she is. You don't? Let me have that. What was the name? It's in West Ginza. It was called, Red... or Black. Which is it? Hey! You can't park there! See you. Get moving! Nobuko? You mean, the proprietress? Proprietress? Sit down. Okay. I just went to your shop. They said you run it. Let me tell you, Mother. If it's money you want, I can't help you. I had a terrible time with Koichi. Koichi came here, too? He went to Osaka last year. I'm going to Hong Kong this fall. I may never come back. Hong Kong? You mean China? I'm the mistress of a Chinese right now. I told him I'm an orphan, so... I don't want you or Koichi to visit me. I understand. I won't come again. I tried my hand at many things. But what's important in life is money. I'm not here to talk about that. You may want us out of your life, but you'll always be my dear daughter. That doesn't matter. We're all individuals, all alone. That's why... Now I see. There are couples who can't get by in life, while others live carefree all alone. What do you mean? Never mind. I'm going now. Then why did you come? I can't come here without a reason? Never mind. Take care, Mother. It's not much. Take it. Thanks. Since it is a gift from you, I accept it with gratitude. Is anything wrong with your mother? Nothing. She'll be all right tomorrow. Call a doctor if she's sick. She's not sick. Did she see your sister? I don't mind if she moves in with us. She has much more money than we have. Though I don't know if she's happier than us. Are we happy? Are you? Lately, I feel as though I can hear when I'm at home. I can understand everything that you and Mother and Ichiro say. As long as I have this home, I can bear any hardships. How about you? Though people may feel sorry, they still don't understand us. Our home is heaven for me, too. The two of us... We took 10 years to become a real couple. We haven't bothered with politics or worldly affairs. We worked hard to build a peaceful life for ourselves. But... Our work is certainly not finished. For Ichiro's sake and for ours, we must try even harder from now on. We must learn to do many more things. Do you think we can? Yes, we can. Once we are happy, we must help others to become happy. There are many healthy people more unfortunate than we are. When I think about it, I feel that God made us happy because we are deaf. Ichiro will enter middle school next year. We're more comfortable now. Next year, I'd like to start my own shop, even a tiny one. I'll be so happy when you do. We must work harder than ever, until Ichiro goes to college. I'll work hard to do your share as well. I don't want you going blind. I'm home. Welcome home. Mother, I watched TV at Suzuki's home. Let's buy one too, someday. We can't afford a TV yet, but on your next vacation, let's all go on a trip. When does your vacation start? The day after tomorrow, after our graduation ceremony. Mother, come to the graduation. I'm sure next year I'll be the Valedictorian of our class. You'll be crying tears of joy, since you cry so easily. Valedictorian? You went to bed already? What's a Valedictorian? He represents the class in receiving the diplomas. The representative? I'll show you. You think you can make it? I'm sure. Then I'll cook up a big feast for next year's graduation. Let's prepare a feast and go somewhere. Next Sunday. Really? Where do you want to go, Mother? Father? Don't know? We've never been anywhere, so we don't know. Only once to the zoo and to the onsen. The zoo? We went right after the war. The zoo had no animals. Let's all go together. Let's go. We'll take some caramel and eggs. Eggs? Dear... The eggs... Yes, the raw eggs. The sunflowers were blooming. Both of the eggs got crushed. What is it? What? What is it, Mother? What is it? Tell us. Diploma for Kiyohiko Oshima. You have completed the curriculum. Good afternoon. Anybody home? Yes. Who are you? I am Akira Ueno. Akira Ueno Akira Ueno? Yes. Is Akiko Katayama in? I'm her mother. I see. She saved me during the air-raids. I am Akira Ueno. Oh, Akira! Yes. We look up to our teachers. So grateful for their kindness. The years on the playground Have passed so quickly. We look back On those precious days. But now we must part And say good-bye. The friendship and kindness Shown every day Will stay with us The rest of our lives. Akira came to visit. He's the boy you always talked about! You brought home a baby turtle for him, but he was gone. Akira. Akira! Yes, it's him. Where is he now? He's at our home. He wants to see you. Be careful! ...and say goodbye. At morning and eve The familiar school windows... Aahh! Akiko... How am Ito go on? ...Akiko. After Mother passed away, Grandma has told me interesting stories everyday... from the time I was little. I had once mistaken a radio for scallions, and cigarettes for eggs. I ate everything I got my hands on. I was like a mouse. Grandma remembers very well... stories about my mother. Mother and Father cannot hear, but... they worked just as normal people do. They raised me with love and care... as normal parents would. At first I was very embarrassed... because my parents are deaf. I don't feel at all embarrassed now. But to tell the truth, it would have been much better if... Mother and Father were not deaf. I love my mother the most in the entire world. I respect my mother and father... the most in the entire world. I will learn to do everything on my own, so that no one has to worry about me. Though my mother has died, She lives on forever in my heart. This is what I believe. This one's bigger. Welcome. What will it be? Three for 30 yen. Here. Thank you very much. That one's for sashimi. Alright. Your radish, Ma'am. Matsutake mushrooms in season already? So early. They're delicious. I know they taste good. Yes, they do. THE END
