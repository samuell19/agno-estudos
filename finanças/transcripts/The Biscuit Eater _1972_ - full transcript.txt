YOU DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH MR. EBEN'S OLD SHEEP DOG. YOU'RE A BIRD DOG. NOW, YOU POINT. AIN'T NO USE, SON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW A BIRD DOG HOW TO POINT. THAT'S BRED INTO 'EM. I KNOW. BUT YOU WON'T LET HIM RUN WITH THE OTHER DOGS, SO I THOUGHT MAYBE HE COULD LEARN IT FROM ME. WELL... EXCEPT HE DON'T WANNA LEARN. I TRIED, SON. THAT DOG IS SPOILED. THAT DOG AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT A SUCK-EGG BISCUIT EATER. YOU SEE THAT, PA ? THE WAY HE DRUG HIS TAIL OUTTA HERE WHEN YOU CALLED HIM THAT NAME ? YOU MADE HIM ADMIT TO SELF-DEFEAT. WHY CAN'T HE HAVE A PRETTY NAME LIKE SILVER BELLE. SON, SILVER BELLE'S A CHAMPION ! SHE'S TAKEN THE GRAND NATIONALS TWICE ! ONE MORE TIME, MR. AMES GETS TO KEEP THAT TROPHY FOR GOOD. I WISH I COULD TRAIN A DOG. YOU MIGHT COULD SOMEDAY. BUT, LONNIE, DON'T GO PINNING YOUR HOPES ON NO BISCUIT EATER. HE AIN'T YOUR DOG, SON. HE'S MR. AMES' DOG. HE KNOWS THAT, HARVE ! BUT HE LOVES THE DOG. - I DON'T KNOW WHY. NOBODY ELSE DOES. - MAYBE THAT'S WHY. SON, I DON'T WANT YOU GETTIN' TOO ATTACHED TO THE DOG. I MEAN, WE CAN'T KEEP A DOG THAT WON'T HUNT. MY DOG HUNTS. HE HUNTS EGGS. - A BIRD DOG'S SUPPOSED TO HUNT BIRDS ! - WELL, HE CAN'T EAT 'EM. WELL NO, WE EAT 'EM. BUT WE PAY HIM BACK WITH GOOD FOOD 'CAUSE HE EARNS IT. HE SURE DON'T HAVE TO SNEAK OFF TO NO HEN HOUSE TO SUCK EGGS. BUT, HARVE... ARE YOU SURE HE CAN'T BE TRAINED ? AS SURE AS I'M SITTIN' HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES WHEN I ORDER HIM TO HUNT ? HE CRAWLS ON HIS BELLY. THE DOG'S GOT A BAD STREAK IN HIM, ANYWAY. HIS SIRE WAS SHOT... BECAUSE HE KILLED SHEEP. BUT, PA ! YOU KNOW I AIN'T GONNA SHOOT NO DOG. - WE MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE HIM AWAY. - OH, HARVE ! HONEY, YOU KNOW I CAN'T HAVE THAT DOG RUNNIN' WITH THE OTHER DOGS. SOMETIMES THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. JUST ONE FLY WILL SPOIL THE BUTTERMILK. DARLING, IT'S NOT AS IF YOUR DAD OWNS THE DOG. I MEAN, HE ONLY WORKS FOR MR. AMES. MR. AMES IS A FAIR MAN. BUT HE WANTS SOME SPORT FOR HIS MONEY. I'LL GUARANTEE YOU, THERE SURE AIN'T NO BLUE RIBBONS IN THAT DOG. HOWDY, HARVE ! HEY, WILLIE ! - AIN'T SEEN YOU IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS ! - OH, REALLY ? - YOU LOOK AS GOOD AS NEW FOLDIN' MONEY ! - I CAN'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH. EVERY TIME I SEE THIS BOY, I TELL YOU, HE DONE GROWED ANOTHER FOOT. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT. WE CAN HARDLY KEEP HIM IN SHOES. YOU ALL COME AND LIGHT A SPELL. A SODA POP ? I'M AFRAID WE CAN'T. THIS IS MY BUSY DAY. YOU BEEN DEVILIN' ME FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT A DOG. WILLIE, I BROUGHT YOU A DOG. WELL, UH... HE SURE AIN'T PRETTY. NO, NOBODY SAID HE WAS PRETTY. 'COURSE, I AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' I CAN PAY YOU WITH. I BEEN WAITIN' ON A GAS DELIVERY A LONG TIME NOW. THEY STILL AIN'T BROUGHT YOU THAT GAS, HUH ? OH, IT'S COMIN'. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, IT LEAVES ME SHORT OF HARD CASH MONEY. WILLIE, I AIN'T TRADIN' HIM. I'M GIVIN' HIM TO YOU. YOU KNOW ME, HARVE. I DON'T TAKE CHARITY. NOW, I MIGHT TRADE YOU. - I DON'T WANT TO TRADE WITH YOU, WILLIE. - BUT TRADIN'S MY THING ! NOW, AS I REMEMBER THE TUBE IN THERE'S ROTTEN. I AIN'T TRADIN' WITH YOU ! LOOK, LOOK AT THIS TUBE. THIS IS A GOOD TUBE. THEY DON'T MAKE TUBES LIKE THIS NO MORE. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THAT. YOU ALWAYS WANT TOO MUCH BOOT FOR YOUR MERCHANDISE. - NOT WITH THE DOG THROWN IN. - BUT I AIN'T TRADIN' THE DOG. I'M GIVIN' HIM TO YA. THIS IS GONNA BE REAL GOOD COMPANY FOR YA, THIS DOG. YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TRAIN HIM VERY MUCH, BUT THAT'S GONNA BE-- - YOU CAN'T TRAIN HIM ? - HE WON'T BE NO HUNTER, ANYTHING LIKE THAT. HE SUCKS EGGS A LITTLE. YOU COULD PROBABLY BREAK HIM. EGG SUCKER ? YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON HIM, WILLIE. AN EGG SUCKER, HUH ? NO, NO. THAT COULD SET ME BACK SOME. I MEAN, I ABOUT LIVE ON EGGS ! YOU AIN'T SO BUSY THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP AN EYE ON THE DOG. AIN'T SO BUSY ? YOU EVER TRIED TO RUN A TRADIN' STORE, A GAS STATION, AND DO YOUR OWN COOKIN' ? IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW MUCH I GOT TO DO JUST KEEPIN' THIS PLACE UP JUST HAULIN' WOOD ! WELL, MAYBE HE AIN'T THE DOG FOR YOU, WILLIE. WAIT A MINUTE, HARVE. DON'T BE HASTY. I CAN'T GO CHASIN' NO DOG THAT'S STEALIN' MY EGGS. BUT IF I DID TAKE THE DOG, HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU GIVE ME TO BOOT ? WILLIE, I'M GIVIN' YOU THE DOG ! I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO BOOT TOO ? I CAN'T BE LOSING NO EGGS. AND THEN THERE'S THE DOG'S FEED TO BE CONSIDERED. I GOT NO WOMAN TO COOK FOR ME. GOT NO YOUNG'UNS TO BE LEAVIN' SCRAPS OF FOOD FOR THE DOG. YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART, WILLIE. - THIS IS ECONOMICS. - YEAH, WELL, I TELL YA. TWO DOLLARS ? YEAH, $2 WILL HELP A LITTLE. BUT YOU KNOW, I MEAN-- THREE DOLLARS, WILLIE, AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A DOG. THANK YOU, HARVE. IT'S A PLEASURE DOIN' BUSINESS WITH YOU. YEAH, IT'S KINDA INTERESTING FOR ME TOO. SON, YOU WANNA HOP IN THE FRONT ? ( Chuckling ) IF YOU CAN'T BREAK HIM FROM SUCKIN' EGGS, YOU CAN ALWAYS TRADE HIM. I RECKON SO. IT'S BEEN SAID I'M A TRADIN' FOOL. IF I HAD ME A WOMAN, I'D TRADE HER TOO ! ( Chuckling ) NOW DON'T YOU GRIEVE YOURSELF. ONE PLACE IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS ANOTHER. HOW COME YOU LET WILLIE DORSEY SLICK YOU OUTTA $3, PA ? WELL, I NEVER KNOW HOW HE'S GONNA DO IT. IT'S WORTH $3 TO FIND OUT. WOULD YOU LET ME OUT HERE, PA ? YOU GONNA STOP AND SEE TEXT ? YEP. GOIN' FISHIN' ? MAYBE. ( Lonnie ) SEE YOU LATER, PA. BYE, BYE, SON. - TEXT ! - OVER HERE, LON. HOWDY, LON. HI, TEXT. CHINKYPIN ? OH, MUCH OBLIGED. RECKON YOUR MA WOULD LET YOU KEEP A DOG IF I BROUGHT THE SCRAPS TO FEED HIM ? - YEAH, I KNOW SHE WOULD. WHY ? - HOW DO YOU KNOW ? EVER SINCE MY BROTHER OBADIAH MOVED OUT AND TOOK HIS DOG... SHE KEEPS SAYIN', "A HOUSE AIN'T A HOUSE WITHOUT A DOG UNDERFOOT." MY PA WON'T LIKE THIS, BUT I KNOW WHERE WE CAN GET US A DOG AND TAKE US TO THE NATIONAL TRIALS... IF WE TRAIN HIM RIGHT. YOU DO ? WHERE AT ? WILLIE DORSEY'S ! WILLIE DORSEY'S ? YEAH ! MY PA GAVE IT AWAY TO HIM THIS MORNING. KNOW WHY ? WHY ? HE CAUGHT HIM SUCKIN' AN EGG. SHUCKS, THAT'LL MAKE HIM ORNERY. THAT DOG'S SLICKER THAN ELM SAP. WANNA GO PARTNERS ? PARTNERS ? I KNOW WHICH HALF OF THE DOG I'D GET... HALF THAT GOES OVER THE FENCE LAST. IN A BIRD DOG THAT'S THE BEST HALF. THAT AIN'T THE WAY I DO BUSINESS. WHEN I SAY PARTNERS, I MEAN WE SPLIT HIM RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE, ALL THE WAY. BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WILLIE'S GONNA PART WITH HIM ? THE LAST WORDS HE SAID IS IF HE DIDN'T LIKE THE DOG, HE'D TRADE. TRADE, HUH ? PROBLEM IS, NOBODY CAN OUT-TRADE WILLIE DORSEY. ANY TACKY OLD THING HE WANTS TO GET RID OF IS THE THING HE'S MOST ATTACHED TO. THEN WE GOTTA UN-ATTACH HIM. WE GOT US A COUPLE OF REAL SUPERFINE UN-ATTACHERS HERE ! I'D PUT YOU UP AGAINST WILLIE DORSEY ANY DAY ! OH, HI, WILLIE ! LONNIE, BACK AGAIN ? AND TEXT. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU ? THIS MORNING YOU SAID "TRADE," WE JUST STOPPED BY TO SEE IF YOU REALLY MEANT IT. TRADE FOR WHAT ? THE DOG. I WOULDN'T TRADE. I BEEN HANKERIN' FOR A DOG FOR A RIGHT SMART SPELL. AND NOW I GOT ME A DOG, I AIM TO KEEP HIM. I JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK. HE WAS SORT OF LIKE A PET TO ME. NOW, IF YOUR FATHER WANTED YOU TO HAVE THAT DOG AS A PET, HE WOULDN'T'VE GIVEN HIM TO ME. NO, BUT TEXT AND ME THOUGHT WE'D KEEP HIM AT HIS HOUSE, SO THEM BLUE-RIBBON DOGS WOULDN'T BE SEEIN' HIM SUCKING EGGS. - BY THE WAY, WHERE IS HE ? - OH, HE'S UH-- - SUCKIN' EGGS ? - HE AIN'T SUCKIN' NONE OF MY EGGS ! WHERE'S HE AT, WILLIE ? HE'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE ! AROUND BACK. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU, TEXT ? THAT DOG IS ALWAYS AROUND BACK WHERE I TELL HIM TO BE. THAT DOG MINDS ME. I SAID HE'S BACK HERE, HE'LL BE BACK HERE. THAT DOG'LL BE WHERE I TELL HIM TO BE. WHY, YOU LOW-DOWN BISCUIT EATER ! I'LL GET ME A STICK AND WEAR YOU OUT ! WILLIE, HE WON'T MIND NOBODY BUT ME. THAT'S HOW COME I WANTED TO TRADE. WHEN I SAW MY PA GIVE YOU THAT $3, I THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY. NOW I CAN SEE HE SHOULD'VE GIVEN YOU MORE. THAT DOG'LL NICKEL AND DIME YOU TO DEATH, ONE BITTY DAB AFTER ANOTHER. WHATCHA TAKE FOR HIM, WILLIE ? WHATCHA GIVE ME ? MY FROG STICKER. WHAT ELSE YOU GIVE ME TO BOOT ? THAT'S ALL I GOT. PARTNER ? ALL I GOT IS THESE TWO BIG HANDS. I SEEN YOU SAWING SOME LOGS BY THE BRIDGE. ME AND LON COULD TOTE 'EM UP FOR YOU. YOU SPLIT 'EM AND PILE 'EM TO BOOT, WE CAN MAYBE HAVE A DEAL. YOU'VE GOT A DEAL. DEAL ! NO. SPLITTIN' AND PILIN'S TOO MUCH. YOU DONE LOW-RATED THAT DOG SO MUCH, I DON'T WANT NO MORE OF HIM. IF THAT DOG STARTS EATIN' MY MA'S EGGS, MY MA'S GONNA SPLIT ME.

AH, WAIT A MINUTE, BOYS. THERE'S ONE LITTLE THING. HOW YOU GONNA PAY ME FOR THEM EGGS YOUR DOG ATE ? - THEY WEREN'T YOUR EGGS. - WHAT YOU MEAN THEY AIN'T MY EGGS ? WELL, HE MEANS, LAYING ON THE GROUND LIKE THAT, THEY COULD BE ANYBODY'S EGGS. BUT WE'LL SEE YOU GET PAID. IF YOU BOYS WOULD JUST PILE AND SPLIT THE WOOD-- IT WAS YOUR DOG WHEN HE ATE THE EGGS. THEM EGGS IS INSIDE THE BELLY OF YOUR DOG NOW. I'LL BRING YOU HALF A DOZEN EGGS FOR THE TWO OUR DOG ATE, BUT NO SPLITTIN' AND PILIN'. I WOULDN'T GIVE SUCH A GENEROUS BARGAIN TO ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS COUNTY. BUT I'M RIGHT FOND OF BOTH OF YOU BOYS. HEY. ( As Willie ) I'S RIGHT FOND OF BOTH YOU BOYS.

I DON'T WANNA HAVE NOTHIN' TO DO WITH THAT MAN. I AIN'T AFRAID OF MR. EBEN. I AM. HE'S A SCUTTER. WHEN HE BUTCHERS BEEF, THEY SAY HE DRINKS THE BLOOD. THAT'S HOW HE GOT HIS FACE ALL RED. HE DON'T SCARE ME. WELL, I AM. I'M SCARED OF HIM. AND YOU ARE TOO IF YOU'D JUST ADMIT IT. AND SO IS YOUR PA. HE IS NOT ! AND IF YOU SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BUST YOU IN TWO HALVES. THEN HOW COME HE DIDN'T WHUP MR. EBEN WHEN MR. EBEN CAME OVER TO HIS HOUSE... AND KICKED HIS DOG 'BOUT TWO YEARS AGO ? BECAUSE MY MA ASKED HIM NOT TO. THAT'S WHY. LADIES ARE ALWAYS TRYIN' TO KEEP MEN FROM WHUPPIN' EACH OTHER. THEY SURE ARE BUTTINSKIS. WHAT'D YOU SAY ? - WELL THEN, ALL EXCEPT YOUR MA AND MY MA, HUH, LON ? - RIGHT.

I KNEW IT WASN'T LOADED. IF ALL THE MEN THAT WERE SHOT WITH UNLOADED GUNS WAS LAID END TO END, THEY'D STRETCH FROM HERE TO NASHVILLE. I GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING, THEY WOULDN'T GET UP AGAIN. PA, WOULD YOU LET MOREOVER WATCH SILVER BELLE POINT JUST ONE COVEY ? THAT WOULDN'T MEAN NOTHIN', LONNIE. BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN'.
