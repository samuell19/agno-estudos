[Sighs] [Door opens] - Hi, Sarah? - Yes. Hi, I'm Claire. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Right this way. So, what's the plan? I need a color touch-up, as you can see, and a trim. OK, sounds good. Can I get you something to drink? Water, wine? Oh, my gosh, a glass of wine sounds amazing. Yes, red. I'll be right back with that and the color. [Pouring wine] - Here you go. - Oh, thank you. Mm. So, are you in town for work? Yeah, um... Is it that obvious I'm not from around here? Uh... no. Do you travel a lot for work? Yeah. Must be exciting. It's not as luxurious as it seems. And I miss my family. Family? Yep. Husband and a 12-year-old. Sweet. Sometimes I wonder if I hate being gone so much because... he seems so fine with it. I'm obsolete. I'm sure that's not true. Moms are moms. I guess, even when we can't be. What do you do? Graphic design. Really? Didn't think that was a job you had to travel for. Seems like a job you could just do at home. But I don't know anything about it, though, really. Well, you mostly can. But I prefer to meet bigger clients face-to-face. You make a better connection when you can look them in the eye. I wish my hair would do that. But we all want what we don't have. That's certainly true. - [Phone rings] - Oh, um... Do you mind if I get this? It's my husband. Not at all. Hey babe, what's up? How's David? Well, you can tell him I'll be home this weekend, and it better be done by then. [Woman] Have a good night, Claire. OK, talk to you tomorrow. Love you, too. Bye. Am I keeping you late? I feel bad. Oh, no. I work late most week nights. It seems to be my most valuable time. - [Phone beeps] - Oh, uh... sorry, I, uh... Well, I met a boy toy here this week, and now he won't leave me alone. - [Phone beeps] - Yeah? I'm only human, you know? It gets lonely. And even at home we haven't had sex since... Are you liking Kansas City? Oh... Yeah, uh... Don't get me wrong, I love traveling, I... I love constantly meeting new people, it's so inspiring. Yeah. That's why I do hair. - Really? - Yeah. You get to go in and out of people's lives, you hear stories, you give life advice. It's almost like having a family. Family... You know something? I have a sister, I have two best friends at home, I even have a therapist, and the only two people who know I'm cheating on Greg... are Boy Toy and you. Why? You trust me? You're a total stranger. You're... You're outside my actual real life. With you, I... I trust that it doesn't matter. I trust I'll never see you again and my secret just... vanishes with you. Hi, Pepper! How's my girl? [Sniffs] [Breathes heavily] [Sobbing] I guess we all want what we don't have. [Chuckles] [Phone buzzes] [Water running] Are you ever gonna use it? No, and I told you that when you bought it for me. - It's safer. - Safer than what? Sunshine? Safer than going alone. I wouldn't be alone if you would come with me. I'm going to take a shower. I might be gone by the time you get done. Well, be careful, I hear it's dangerous out there. - [Woman] There you go. - [Man] Thanks. Hi. Hi, what can I get for you? Can I get a cappuccino, please? - Yeah, for sure. What size? - Small. - Anything else for you? - No. Alright. [Distorted] I'll have that right out for you. Thank you. Medium almond milk chai latte? Uh... Claire? - Want your usual? - Um... Chai latte with almond milk, please. OK, so your usual. Um... medium? - Small is fine. - OK. Thanks. Claire? That chai for you that you clearly need. Thanks. See you. Hey, yeah, it's Olivia. What the fuck? I get that, but look in the lower left-hand corner. You see where it says "cuticle management"? Yeah, this is in fact an ad for cubicles, not cuticles. Yeah, it's a problem. OK, great. Thank you. Is it too soon to say I'm sorry? - Yeah. - I heard about Natalie bailing. She's always been really reliable, I swear. It's OK, it's not your fault. Don't worry about it. So, what are you going to do? I texted my regular stylist this morning. She doesn't normally do weddings, but I begged and hopefully I'll hear back later today. - She any good? - She is amazing. She was my first choice. The stuff she does with hair - jaw-dropping. Well, if she's so good, why doesn't she do weddings? That's a good question. I think they're a little high stress for her. Hmm! Aren't you worried about fitting in your dress? At this rate, I'll be walking down the aisle in a baseball cap and overalls, so I need this. Is everything else going OK? As smoothly as possible. Charlie is a little tense, but we haven't hired assassins yet. Well, if you ever need a recommendation, I might know someone. Oh, really? Cos your hair lady just bailed on me, so what do I do if your hit man bails on me? I'd be totally fucked. [Phone beeps] Hi Dawn, the usual. Oh, there's the Claire I know. You doing better today? - Great. - Good. Everything's great. - Thank you. - Hi. [Door opens] Hi. Come on back. Claire, you are literally saving my life. I don't know about all that. So, tell me everything. - Oh, could you take this off? - Oh. What are you hoping for? Do you have pictures of your dress? Do I have pictures of the dress! OK. Oh, my God, you look amazing. Yeah? It's the first one I tried on. Amazing. Perfect. Alright, so hair, what are you hoping for? I mean, with that dress you could really wear any style. Yeah, so, like... down and a little curly. Do you have any photos of, like, the styles you like, so I can kind of have an idea? Yeah, I took your advice, I did a lot of research. - Like this. - OK. I love it. So, how is Charlie handling the wedding madness? Is he excited? Yeah, I mean, way more than me. He loves being the center of attention. We should all probably be worried that he's going to turn into a groom-zilla. [Laughs] Is it weird that I'm nervous right now? A little. I'm kidding, it's totally normal. Hair is important, you know, maybe the most important. It's gonna be great, though, I promise. Oh, my God, Claire, this is amazing. I seriously don't know why you don't do weddings all of the time. This is amazing! So much better than the other girl. Here. Check it out from behind. Oh... [Chuckles] It's not that I don't like to do weddings, I just... I don't know, I find them really... Intense? Yeah. [Chuckles] Wow. Uh! Can't wait to see this with the dress. Oh. Neither can I. - Can you send me a photo? - Oh, yeah. Make sure you take it down before Charlie sees it. How much do I owe you? - 65? - Oh, that's a steal. I wish I had someone to show it to tonight. Hey, what are you doing tonight? You wanna come over and see the hair and dress together? - I... I'd be happy to. - Yeah? Cool, I'll text you my address. Oh, I... I'd appreciate that. - Like, uh... maybe eat dinner? - Sure, but what about Charlie? Oh, he'll probably be working late, so... girl's night. Yeah? - Yeah. - Great. I love it! Alright, see you tonight. Yeah. [Chuckles] [Car door slams] Hey, come on in! Sorry, it's a mess in here. Ugh! I know. I told him I didn't want it, yet here it is. I already feel like I'm running in place all day at work, you know? So, when I run, I actually want to get somewhere. You know what I'm saying? Oh, I was starving, so I ordered pizza. I hope that's cool. Sounds great. Oh, this is great. It's Merlot. I hope that's OK. Yes. Always yes. [Cork pops] [Wine pouring] Oh. To Claire, the savior of my wedding. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No. No big deal. Do you want to see this dress? Of course. I'll be right back. Hey, Claire, could you come up here and help me with this? Yeah, coming. [â™ª Music playing faintly] [Knocking on door] - Ready? - Yeah, come on in. Apparently, you can't put on a wedding dress by yourself. Fucking buttons, are you kidding me? Perfect. No. The hair is perfect. Seriously, Claire, it's amazing. I owe you so, so much. I'm just glad you like it. Oh, can you take some photos for my mom and sister? Yeah, of course. OK. - Ready? - Yeah. [Both chuckling] OK. - And the back, too? - Yeah. OK, got it. Thank you. And do you mind helping me get this off before I mess it up? There you go. - I'm gonna wait downstairs. - OK. I never even thought I'd be a bride. I always thought if I got married, it would be on a whim. - Really? - Yeah. I was super rebellious in high school. You know, "Fuck the patriarchy." - I went to my prom in a tux. - [Both chuckle] - I wouldn't have guessed that. - Yeah. Oh! Hopefully, younger me doesn't hate current me. It looks like you have a huge family. Yeah. They take up like half of the wedding invitations. Oh, shit. See, the younger me does hate current me. It's nice... that you're close to your family. Mm. Is that your mom in that picture? Yeah. And your dad? Uh... no. That is my uncle. My mom's brother. My dad wasn't around. Really? Yeah. He was one of those classy gents who promised everything and then took off once the baby was born. I never knew him. Let's just say I'm walking myself down the aisle. Oh, God, listen to me. Getting married turns you into such a narcissist. It's like me, me, me. Stories about me. Tell me about you, Claire. What about you, are you close to your family? Oh, um... I never knew my dad either. Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, don't let it get to you. It's not you, it's him. I mean, look how amazing we turned out. Fuck him. What about your mom? She died when I was 17. Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. This is her. She was only 35. She's really beautiful. She was drunk. I mean... that's how she died. She was a hair stylist also. She was always changing her hair color and her hair style. She never kept it the same way for more than a few months. I never knew who was gonna come home. Well... I think it's cool that you're following in her footsteps. I'm sure she would be really proud. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Oh. Hey, babe. This is Claire. - My hair stylist. - Oh. The savior of the wedding. Hi, Claire. It's nice to meet you. You too. Claire was just telling me that her mom was also a hair stylist. It's been a really long day. I'm really hungry. Oh. Yeah, OK. Um, there are some slices left. I should probably call it a night. - Thanks for having me. - Yeah, no thanks needed. See ya. [Sobbing] I never knew... I never knew my dad either. I should probably call it a night, I should... I should probably call it a night. I should probably call it a night! Fuck! Fuck. [Exhales] - Shit. Sorry, we close at ten. - Oh, sorry. Claire? It's kind of a late night for you isn't it? Yeah, emergency wedding hair. - Right, um... Come on in. - Thanks. I'll just lock the door behind you if that doesn't make you too nervous. [Chuckling] - The usual, right? - Yeah. It's a late night for you, too, isn't it? Yeah. Turns out I can only boss teenagers around if they actually show up. When they don't, I am the one who has to cover. Oh, don't worry about it. I already counted the register. Thanks. Nothing like a late night caffeine fix and a double shift to make you rethink your life, right? Oh, well. I guess there's always grad school. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. And the next day, and the next day, and the next day. [Gasps] - What...? - [Panting] [Groans] What the fuck, Claire? [Screams] [Sobbing] [Olivia] 'No. Don't let it get to you. 'It's not you, it's him. 'I mean, look how amazing we turned out. 'Fuck him.' [PA] 'Toby to the front counter. Toby to the front counter. Keeping someone in or someone out? - Sorry, bad joke. - Keeping someone out. Definitely keeping someone out. You need to go outside? Want to get breakfast, Pep? Come on. [Water running] [Phone buzzing] Hi, how can I help you? Hey, um... my wife's sister, Dawn, she's been missing for two days, and we were wondering if we could put a flyer up in here. [Echoing] I'm so sorry to hear that. She worked just down the street... [Conversation continues indistinctly] Don't wait up. I left out a little treat. [â™ª Hip-hop playing] â™ª I just hope you're not mistaken â™ª When I told you that I made it â™ª There's no need for any waiting â™ª This here throne is for the taking â™ª If you want it, come and get it â™ª If it's yours, you should be with it â™ª â™ª I don't care about your business â™ª I just want you there to witness when I make it... â™ª Claire! â™ª I say it and I'll do it again - â™ª Put your glasses to the sky - We're up here. â™ª Yeah â™ª By double-checking on me, yeah â™ª Second-guessing, are we? Come on. â™ª Tell me your fantasies... [Olivia] Oh, wait, uh Melissa. OK, alright, alright. [Indistinct chattering, laughing] Don't show someone! I look horrible in that. Oh, my God. Oh, Claire. Claire, Claire, come on. Come in here. Here, make room. OK, here you go. Sit right here. I have to warn you right now, I am very drunk. That's fine. This is my little sister, Rose. She got the looks in the family. This is Monique. - We work together. - Hi. She's the one who screwed up my wedding hair. This is Chelsea, Elizabeth, and Christie. This is Claire, everybody. My hair stylist and the savior of my wedding. - Hey, Claire. - Hi, Claire. Hi, everyone. OK, I did the introductions or whatever. Oh, you can have this drink. We just poured it. - It'll be for you. - Oh, thanks. We should drink. We should toast, right? OK, a toast. To all the best bitches! - Woo! - Yes! Oh, my God. We should go dance. - Yes. - Right? - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Right? Oh, my God. Do you dance? - You'll have so much fun. - OK. - Oh, oh sorry. - That's OK. Oh, my God.

I have to go to the bathroom. Yeah. Wish someone would've watched mine. I lost count a long time ago. I'm never like this. I'm just... I am actually nervous. I meant it when I said that I thought I'd never get married. I don't really know what I'm doing. It's going to be great, Olivia. You're going to be beautiful. I do really love Charlie. I just feel like sometimes... that maybe he doesn't see me, you know? He, um... He interrupted you. Yeah. Yeah. Like... That's exactly how it can feel. It feels like I've been interrupted. You get it. I'm glad you came. I'll be right back. Hey, um... Do you run? Do I... what? Like, run, like... like, jog? I've never had a running buddy before. Yeah. - Yeah. I... I love running. - OK. Oh, my God. OK, when this wedding madness is over, you and I are going to run laps around this town, girl. - I'll be right back. - OK. [Indistinct chattering, laughing] [Footsteps approaching] OK, who is that guy? No idea, but he keeps buying me drinks, so I'm OK with him. OK. So what's up with the hair stylist? Like, why is she here? [Monique] I don't know. She's fucking creepy. I caught her staring at me. Like, does Liv know her? Like, actually know her? Just promise me when... if I get married, don't let me invite the cake lady or something. You are such a bitch. - Well, who does that? - I'll be your cake lady. [Olivia] Oh, my God. Thank you for coming. [Woman] Love you. Bye. Be safe. Have fun. Thank you. [Panting] [Door creaking] [Breathing heavily] [Breathing heavily] [Urinating] [Panting] [Sniffs] [Sighs] [Woman] 'Check out the nails. 'You know, I had to get them done. 'My bestie is getting married this weekend, 'so a girl had to look good.' [Olivia] 'Can I sit my aunt next her ex-husband's friend? 'It's not really that big of a deal.' 'Help me with this!' [Sighs] 'Oh, don't let it get to you. 'It's not you, it's him. 'I mean, look how amazing we turned out.' Do you remember that thing I was telling you about last time? So, it became this whole ordeal. And Mandy, you know her, right? Well, she just refuses to listen to Dominick. And it pisses him off, and then I have to hear... [Conversation grows indistinct] Claire. What do you, uh... What's up? I know that you said you have everything under control, but I figured that there must be something I can do to help. Yeah... How did you know where I worked? You've told me a million times. I remember when you first got hired here, you were so proud. Oh, yeah. [Chuckles] Uh, like I said, we're good. I'm gonna head home, but I'll see you on Saturday, OK? Maybe we could get together tonight with your bridesmaids, and we could talk about how you want their hair done, - and then... - Claire, honey, this is a lot. I have a lot going on right now. My boss won't let me off on Friday for my rehearsal dinner. - That's why I want to help. - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I don't want anyone else offering me help, or asking questions, or jumping in on things. I just need some space, you know? Not just from you. Everyone. OK? Maybe you need space from Charlie. What? You said you weren't sure about him. About any of this. Maybe if you could just... This... This is not something you say to people two days before their wedding. I'm telling you this because I feel like you don't actually know that. I'm sorry. I would not let my own mother say that shit to me or anyone who actually knows me. S... Strangers. What? S... uh... Sometimes... people can, um... talk to strangers in ways that they... Don't be like this on Saturday. Bye. [Olivia] 'My house is a fucking disaster 'because tomorrow is the big day. 'It really crept up on us. 'I'm really excited. I guess we're ready.' [Charlie] 'Hello, Claire? Hi. Is... Is this...? 'Yeah, it's Charlie. What's up?' Oh... Sorry to bug you, um... I'm looking for Olivia. 'Uh, she's pretty busy. 'We just got to the rehearsal dinner with the family.' Um... Do you need wine? 'What... huh?' I might have an extra bottle lying around. 'Hey, um... 'She wanted me to check that this wasn't an emergency. 'You're still good for tomorrow at 10am, right?' Yes. Of course, I... I would never miss it. 'OK, good. Yeah, um... 'Well, cool, uh... You can come early if you want to. 'We're just going to be running around and pretty busy, so...' Sure. 'OK.' Sorry... 'No, you're good. Look, we'll just see you tomorrow. 'OK?' You interrupted her, Charlie. 'Yeah, alright. Well, uh... 'We'll see you tomorrow. Alright. Bye.' [Hangs up] [Olivia] 'I mean, look how amazing we turned out.' [Chuckles] [Sighs] [Sniffs] [Humming] [Gasps] [Breathing heavily] [Moans] [Breathing intensifies] [Door opens] - Oh, fuck! - [Olivia] Can you believe we're doing the "separating the night before" thing? [Woman] We can at least drink without that stupid Charlie look of judgment. [Conversation continues indistinctly] [Dog barking] Hmm! [Panting] So fucking stupid! So fucking stupid! [Sobbing] [Panting] [Strains] [Grunts] [Grunts] [Panting] That glass ceiling is a real bitch. [Echoing voice] 'I'm hoping this goes a long way 'towards finally getting that promotion.' [Sobbing] [Olivia] 'Don't be like this on Saturday. 'Absolutely perfect.' Ugh! I guess we all want what we don't have. [Echoing voice] [Sobbing] [Echoing voices, indistinct] [Screams] No! 'The finish is perfect.' Bye, guys. See you later. [Knocking on door] [TV blares, knocking continues] Uh... I need help. Could I use your phone? Yeah. Wait right here, let me grab it. [Choking] [TV blares] Mm. [Laughing] Funeral? Is she...? Don't you already know? Claire? [Church bell tolling] Hey, look. I'm not nervous, you're nervous. Hey, Claire. Hey. Thanks for being here. Do you promise to make her happy? What, are we practicing my vows? Yeah, of course. Do you promise you really see her? I do. Let me get that. Claire? Yeah, hi. Great. Olivia's right this way, just follow me. Thanks. I wasn't sure where to go, I've never been here before. Isn't it so beautiful? How do you know Olivia? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm her mother. I'm... I'm Frankie. Oh, it... it's nice to meet you. Olivia talks about you all the time. Don't be silly. Oh, my God, Claire. Thank you so much for coming through. It means everything. Where should I set up? - Uh, is right here OK? - Yeah. - Uh, this is for you. - Thank you. - I'll just be a few minutes. - OK. I'm ready. Go take a look. What do you think? How does it look? - You look so beautiful. - Thank you. Beautiful! Oh, my God, I'm so happy for you! Do you want to get your hair done, too? Can you make it pretty like Olivia's? Of course I can. You're very beautiful, so it's gonna be easy. Come on. There you go. Olivia, you look amazing. [Phone beeps] Charlie is ready for the big reveal. You want to go see how he cleans up? Got it? There you go, now you're ready to walk down the aisle. Thank you. Oh, do you know where the bathroom is? Oh, sure. It's right over there. Thanks. [Charlie] Do you know how beautiful you are? And how lucky I am? Do you know how cold you are? Freezing. I can't wait to marry you. [Knocking on door] Hey, they're looking for you. Need help with the veil, I think. - On my way. - OK. Oh! Claire, you want to come over here and help with this, so I don't mess up your beautiful work? The usher's here. It's time for me to go, so I'll see you out there? Yeah. I love you so much. I love you, too. - OK, baby. - OK. There you go. Thanks. Sorry that I barked at you the other day. Pressure's just been building for a while, you know? Yes. Yes. Claire, are you OK? No. No, I'm sorry. I have to tell you something. OK. What is it? I don't run. What? I don't run, Olivia. [Sobbing] [Man] Here we go. [â™ª RICHARD WAGNER: "Bridal Chorus"] [Man] Please be seated. Baby. [Gasping] [Screaming] What did you do? What did you do? What's going on? Where is she? Where is she? [Olivia] 'I mean, look how amazing we turned out.'
