[MUSIC PLAYING] - Coming to you from Desmond Hall, in the heart of Miami's beautiful new world center, Jackie Gleason presents "The Honeymooners." Starring Jackie Gleason and Art Carney, Audrey Meadows and Jane Kean. And away we go! [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] (HUMMING) - Hi, Alice. [APPLAUSE] - Hi, Trix. - Here are those dark glasses you wanted. - Oh gee. Thanks. You know, those lights at the switchboard down at the office are awfully bright. These'll be great. - Good. Are you working again tonight? - Yeah, but it'll only be for a few more days, and then I'll have enough money to buy Ralph's Valentine's Day present. - Oh, good. - But you know I'm getting awful sick of making up all those lies, telling him where I'm going at night. I think he's just beginning to get a little suspicious. - What's that? - Oh, this is a duplicate of the calls that I get down at the office. I have to turn it in at the end of the week. - Were there any interesting calls last night at the answering service? - Oh! Wait'll I tell you. Trix, you know Mr. Vargo the butcher? - Sure. - Well, he and Mrs. Raymond, the florist, they've got a little thing going. - No. - Yes. Now he calls. And he leaves the message. And if he says, "Your liver is ready," that means he wants her to come right over. But if she says, "My petunias are drooping," it means she can't make it. [LAUGHTER] - What does she say when she can make it? - She says, "Take the liver out of the freezer." [LAUGHTER] I tell you, you never know what's going on right in your own neighborhood. - Oh, I know it. Hey, what are all these calls? Armand, Armand, Armand. - He runs an escort service. Now, I want to tell you, that Armand must really be something because all the women ask for him personally. - Really? - Yeah. - Well if Mrs. Raymond finds out about Armand, Vargo's going to be stuck with a lot of liver. [LAUGHTER] - You know what? Ralph's going to be home soon and I've got to hide this, or he'll suspect that I'm working. - Oh, right. - Listen? You want to grab that end of the table? - Did you figure out what you're going to give Ralph for a Valentine's Day present? - Oh, yes. I'm going to get him a tailor-made suit. - Really? - Yep. But I have one problem. Since he lost so much weight, I don't know his size. I have to figure out a way to get his measurements without his knowing it. - Mm. Gee, a new suit's a very expensive present for Valentine's Day, isn't it? - Oh, yes. But this is very important, Trix. After all, it was Valentine's Day when Ralph proposed to me. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh. Your day's more romantic than ours was. Ed proposed to me on Groundhog's Day. [LAUGHTER] So every Groundhog's Day, Ed comes up out of the sewer. And if he-- [LAUGHTER] If he sees his shadow there, I don't get a present. [LAUGHTER] - What happens if he doesn't see his shadow? - I still don't get a present. [LAUGHTER] And there are six more weeks left of winter. - Oh! [APPLAUSE] - Hiya, sweetie. - Hi, darling. - Hiya Trix. - Oh, hello, Ralph. Well, I guess I'd better be going. It's groundhog feeding time. [LAUGHTER] - Well, Ralph, your supper's in the oven, and I'm sure you want to hurry up and eat so that you can go bowling. - What's the rush? - Well, tonight's your bowling night. - I thought maybe tonight I'd stay home. - Oh, but you got to go bowling. - Why do I have to go bowling? - Oh, well. You know, you love bowling. And when you go bowling, you see all your friends. And, uh, and bowling's very healthy, Ralph. It's very good exercise for you. By the way, Ralph, what's your waist measurement? - 146. [LAUGHTER] - That's your waist measurement? - No, it's my bowling average. [LAUGHTER] What're you talking about? My waist or my bowling? Anyway, I thought that, uh, tonight maybe we could, uh, sit on the couch and do a little necking. [LAUGHTER] - We don't have a couch. [LAUGHTER] - Well, we could put two of the chairs together, and do it on that. [LAUGHTER] - Oh, Ralph, I'm in a hurry. I have plans for tonight. - Where you going? - Oh, oh, I thought I told you. I'm going to my sister's. - Again? - Well, yes. You know I told her I'd help her hang the drapes. I've got to hurry, Ralph. Now you keep an eye on the oven because I do have to change. [APPLAUSE] - Did you get Alice her Valentine present yet? - Shh! She's in there. I certainly did get a Valentine's present. - [LAUGHTER] - I got her a stereo, a color TV, and an electric kitchen. It has a dishwasher, a washing machine, a dryer, a stove, and a Frigidaire. All soundless. - Oh, boy. That must be costly and expensive. - Heh. You can say that again. I had to put $5 down. [LAUGHTER] - Hey, tell me one thing, Ralph. How you going to get all that stuff delivered in here without her seeing it? - Huh. That might not be a big problem. She's running out of here every night. Says she's going over to her sister's. Oh, I got the contract for the electric kitchen here. - Uh-huh. - Payments of $10 a month. - For how long? - I'll give you a hint. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I got to hide this some place. I don't want Alice to see it. Hey, open the table. [LAUGHTER] Can't, there's already something in there. - What is it? - List of phone calls Alice has been making. Close it up. [BANGING] Got to be some place. [LAUGHTER] What does Alice got with a list of phone calls? - What are you asking me for? What's on the list? - Open it up. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. Mr. Vargo, the butcher. - Vargo. Vargo the butcher. Well, that's a normal call. He's a butcher. Butcher shop. Good shop. I was in there the other day. The only trouble is it takes forever to get waited on. He's always on the phone yelling, "Your liver is ready! Your liver is ready!" [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Get a load of this. - What? - Armand. Another call to Armand. - Yeah. - Armand, Armand, Armand, Armand. And she told me she was going to her sister's. - Wait a minute, Ralph. I got a question to ask you. It may exonerate Alice, make her completely innocent. - What? - Is Alice's sister's name Armand? [LAUGHTER] - Are you an idiot? - Well, then just go march right in there as fast as your fat little legs'll carry you and tell her that you're on to her game. - Oh, no. I'm playing this cool. Close up the table. [BANGING] I'm going to let Alice convict herself. - Well, how you going to do that? - All I have to do is look into Alice's eyes and I can tell what she's up to. I can tell whether she's lying or telling the truth. - Hi, Ed. [LAUGHTER] Ralph, I'm going to go to my sister's but I'll be back later. Oh, darn it. I forgot my keys. All right, Norton. When she walks out of here, you follow her. I want to know where she's going. - Have no fear. - Goodbye, sweetheart. - Bye. - Alice. - Bye. - Get going. Get going! [LAUGHTER] - Don't be worried about a thing, Ralph. I'm going to follow her very closely, see, but far enough behind so she don't get suspicious, but close enough so I don't lose her. Even if she gets in a subway car, I'll be in the next car, see? - Will you go on? [LAUGHTER] - Do you happen to have a trench coat? - Get out of here! [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] - What now? - I lost her on the stairs. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] - How you doing', Alice? - Oh, I'll be with you in a minute, Trix, just as soon as I finish filling this out. - What is that? - Oh. This is an insurance policy. I got it down at the place where I work. Do you know that for $0.25 a week, if anything happens to me or to Ralph, the other one gets $2,000? - Oh, that's terrific. - Yeah. - Mm. Any interesting calls last night? - Oh, that reminds me. Yeah, Armand got his usual 20 calls. And there were a few others. Do you mind, Trix? - Sure. Did you get Ralph's measurements for the suit yet? - Not yet. But I got to tell you, this is the greatest hiding place in the world because Ralph would never think of looking here. [LAUGHTER] You know something? The tailor told me I got to get those measurements today. - No kidding. - Or the suit will not be ready on time. - Oh. - Do you have a tape measure? - Well, Ed's got one of those carpenter's tape measures. I suppose you could use that. - Oh, that'll be great. Yeah. [LAUGHTER] - Hey, Ralph. Where's Ed? I thought he was coming home with you. - Oh, uh, he had to go upstairs for something. Hello, Alice. - Oh. - Hello, Ralph. - Well. - Well, uh, what's new? - Oh nothing, Ralph. - Oh. Aren't you going over to your sister's? - No. As a matter of fact, I'm staying home tonight. But, uh, I have to run up to Trixie's for a minute first. [LAUGHTER] - Oh. [LAUGHTER] - Hi. Hi, Trixie. - Hello, Ed. - Mind telling me what's for dinner? Don't tell me leftovers. - All right. We're having srevotfel. - What's that? A Russian dish? - It's "leftovers" spelled backwards. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Hey, Trixie. How would you like a taf pil for dessert? - Taf-- what's that? - That's "fat lip" spelled backwards. [LAUGHTER] - Did you get the phone book? - Quasimodo never fails. [LAUGHTER] - Open it up. Now we're going to find out what really is going on. - OK. What's on the list? - All right. First name. - Yeah. - Sandy Leach. - Sandy Leach. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Will you come on with that! [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - You gotta let your fingers do the walking, then your lips do the talking. - Just get the number! - Sandy Leach with an L. Leach runs a drugstore. - Drugstore. All right. Get-- oh, this must be a business. Manners and Pollock Inc. - Manners and P-- don't have to call that up. They manufacture ink. [LAUGHTER] - That's "incorporated"! Look it up! - Manners and Pollock Inc. Insurance. - Oh. Oh, here. Look up "Harvey Duke." - Harvey Duke. Duke. I once had a dog named Duke. [LAUGHTER] I loved my dog. I fed my dog Duke every day. I fed him Duke dog food. [LAUGHTER] He was almost as smart as me. - That's hard to believe. [LAUGHTER] Look it up! - Duke. Duke. Harvey Duke. Eh, funeral home. Harvey Duke Funeral Home. - Here's another one. "The Gates of Eternity." Oh ho. That's some rock and roll club or something. That's probably where she goes dancing with that Armand. - All right. Gates of Eternity. That would be right after F for the G. Gates of-- Nah, you've got nothing to worry about. It's not a rock joint. - What is it? - It's a cemetery. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. Any other numbers in there? Any other list-- - I don't understand. Why would she be calling a druggist, an insurance firm, a funeral director, a cemetery? - No other-- no other numbers there? - Yeah, there's another one. - Uh, if it's a caterer, and their slogan is, w"e cater everything from bar mitzvahs to wakes," I think you're in trouble. Because I don't think you're about to be bar mitzvahed. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Why would Alice keep a list of these phone calls? - Well, it's quite simple. Take it off her income tax for business expense. - What business? - The business she's giving you. [LAUGHTER] - Norton. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Well, if I think I'm thinking what you're thinking, I saw a similar thing on television once, on the baldie Kojak show. It was this story about this wife wanted to kill her husband, see? First thing she does, she goes to a druggist store and get some poison, see? Then she increases her insurance. Then, she goes home, sneaks up behind her husband-- - Yeah, and then what happened? - I don't know. I switched channels. I wanted to watch Sonny Bono instead. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Now I'll never know. - Yes, you will. They'll be reruns next summer. [LAUGHTER] - By next summer, I'll be in the Gates of Eternity. - Ah! Got another listing there? - No, Norton. This is not another list. This is the end. [LAUGHTER] She's taken out more insurance on me. [LAUGHTER] Close it up, Norton. - OK. - You know? You know what's sad about this whole thing? - What? - Valentine's Day is coming up. You know it was on a Valentine's Day that I proposed to Alice. - Oh. - Heh. I can remember it just like it was yesterday. I went down to 42nd Street. You know where they have all those jewelry stores? - Oh, yeah. - They have those signs in the windows, cash or credit, spelled with a K? Well, I went into one of them. I got Alice a diamond engagement ring for $14. [LAUGHTER] - How classy. Also spelled with a K. [LAUGHTER] - I wanted to make it a big night. You know, the night I proposed to her had to be a big night. So I took her over to Jersey. To Frank Daly's Meadowbrook on Pompton Turnpike. Remember that joint? - Oh, sure. - Used to have a lot of big bands and everything? - Oh, yeah. - Real classy joint, too. They had a $4 minimum. Alice and I took care of that right away. We had two zombies a piece. [LAUGHTER] And they had a orchestra there, Sammy K and the Swing and Sway Orchestra. - Sure. - And do you remember he used to have that contest "So You Want to Lead a Band?" - Oh, yeah. - Well, during the night he gets a bunch of guys up there, including me, to lead the band. In a contest, you know. Eh, the song I had the lead was "Yes, We Have No Bananas." [LAUGHTER] Well, I lead it. And then he lines us all up, and he puts his hands over our head. I won. - Hey. The crowd must have loved ya. - They certainly did. And Alice, she made more noise than anybody else in the joint. She never had two zombies before. [LAUGHTER] And what do you think I got for a prize? - What? - An autographed baton. - How lucky can you get? [LAUGHTER] - Then I went back to the table, proposed to Alice. She accepted. And ever since that night, that's been our song. - What's that? - "Yes, We Have No Bananas." [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Did I ever show you that baton? - I never seen your baton. - Wait'll I show it to you. Right over here. I've kept it in here for years. - Aha. - Where's my baton? What has Alice done with my baton? - Well, she probably gave it to Armand. He's using it for a king-sized toothpick. [LAUGHTER] - If Armand has got a hold of my baton, that's the end. [LAUGHTER] - Ralph, let me tell you something. I'm going to square with you. She's out to get you. I don't know how it's going to happen. But listen, you got to act very cool. Be alert. If Alice acts strange, you've got to go along with it. Cause you don't know how it's going to happen. Could be poison. Could be a knife. Maybe one day you'll be opening up your lunch box and out pops a black widow spider. [LAUGHTER] You don't know. You don't know how it's going to happen. But above all, be alert. Don't take no naps. Don't take no naps at all. And don't go asleep. [LAUGHTER] Above all, don't go to sleep. - Hey, Ed. Your dinner's ready. - Oh. Thank you, Alice. Well, Ralph, I, uh, I'll see you later. Or let me put it this way. I hope I'll see you later. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Oh, Ralph, I left my apron in the other room. Would you mind getting it for me? - Huh. I'll get it. - Oh, thank you sweetheart. Listen. Your supper's not going to be ready for quite a few minutes. Why don't you go in the other room, and take a nap? [LAUGHTER] - Oh, no. I'm not taking any nap, Alice. I'm never going to take a nap as long as I live! How do you like that? - Suit yourself. Why don't you just sit down then and relax? What is the matter with you, Ralph? You're making me nervous. Now sit down. I'll get you the paper. You can read that. Gosh. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - I heard a noise, Alice. [LAUGHTER] - Noise? I didn't hear any noise. Oh, Ralph, what kind of a noise was it? Was it a scary noise, Ralph? Oh, Ralph, please protect me. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - I heard that noise again, Alice. - Oh, I know what it was, Ralph. My earring fell off, and I think it rolled under the bureau. Would you see if you can get it for me, please? [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Ralph, you know what'd be better? If you stretched out flat on your stomach. Then you could reach all the way under and get it. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Oh, Ralph. How stupid of me. I forgot I left my earring in the bedroom. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Ralph! Ralph! They did it to you already. Ralphie, my best pal. I'm gonna miss you. [LAUGHTER] Ralphie, boy. You're raising up, Ralph. You coming back to haunt her? You're coming back to haunt somebody faster than anybody ever knew. You'll be known as the Galloping Ghost! - Will you shut up?! [LAUGHTER] - Ralph, you really are here. Tell me, Ralph. Tell me. What happened? - You want to know happened? You want to know what happened? - Yeah, yeah. - Alice just measured me for a coffin. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] - Ralph, are you sleeping? - I'm wide awake. [LAUGHTER] - Ralph, I'm going to go up to Trixie's for a minute. I've got to borrow some bread. - I'm wide awake! [LAUGHTER] I'm wide awake! [LAUGHTER] - What do you say, Ralph? - I'm wide awake, Alice! - Ralph, I'm not Alice, and you're out on your feet. - Norton, I'm goin' nuts. I haven't slept in three days. I'm exhausted. Maybe I can sneak a nap while Alice is gone. - You're not going to sneak no nap in while I'm around. You can't take a nap. You can't go to sleep. That's dangerous. I'll tell you what I do in the sewer. You know, let me tell you something. A lot of people think that sewer work is glamorous. You know, there's a lot of fun and floating around and all that stuff. [LAUGHTER] It's dull and humdrum many a times. Many of times I feel like falling asleep. You know what could happen if I fall asleep? I could get drowned. [LAUGHTER] I come upon a method, see? When I get sleepy and dozy in the sewer, I turn on a little music. And it perks me up there, wakes me up. And I keep moving around, see? - I'll try anything, Norton. - All right. You ready? - I'm ready. - OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hear this? All righty. It's tap toe time! [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Come on! Up on your feet, Ralph! Yeah, baby! Keep moving. [APPLAUSE] - Shut that thing off! - Hey, see, you're not asleep. - No, I'm unconscious! You dope! - Ralph, as your best friend for many years, all I'm trying to do is trying to help you, the best I can. That's all. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-- I didn't mean to yell at you. I know you've been a good friend and a pal during this crisis. As a matter of fact, after I'm gone, Norton, I want you to have my bowling ball-- [LAUGHTER] --and my new cue stick. - Ralph, on second thought, maybe you ought to go ahead and take a nap. [LAUGHTER] - Get out! - Ralph! Come on out here! Come on, I got a surprise for you. [LAUGHTER] - I know you got a surprise, Alice. Look, Alice, I know I haven't been a good husband. But do I deserve this? - You deserve it, and you're going to get it. [LAUGHTER] - Alice, I don't know this'll do any good. Do you know what I got you for Valentine's Day? - Oh, wait'll you hear what I got for you, Ralph. - Give me a hint. - Well, it's bigger than a breadbox. [LAUGHTER] - It sure is. - I'll give you another hint, Ralph. It'll cover you from your hand to your toes. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Now, why don't you sit down? Because I've got something to give you. - I'd rather get it standing up. [LAUGHTER] Alice, let me ask you something. And if I do, will you level with me? - Well, of course. - Since we've been married, did you ever feel like you wanted to be separated? You know, get a divorce? - Divorce? Absolutely not. - You mean that? - Why, certainly. When I took that vow at our wedding, I meant it. - What vow? - "Till death do us part." [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Sit down, sweetheart, because I have prepared a special meal for you. Come on. - So that's how I'm going to get it. [LAUGHTER] - Oh, boy. This looks good. Now, doesn't that look good, Ralph? - What is it? - Oh, it's a surprise. - I know it's a surprise. What's in it? - Everything. - Everything? - Mm-hmm. - You're not taking any chances, are you? [LAUGHTER] - Now for the final touch. I'll just shake a little bit of this. And that should do the trick. [LAUGHTER] - Why hasn't that jar got a label on it? - Oh, that's the secret ingredient. [LAUGHTER] - What secret ingredient? - Well, it's grated cheese and a lot of chopped up dried mushrooms-- a lot of those. Taste it, Ralph. You'll remember that for the rest of your life. [LAUGHTER] - Which will be about three more minutes. [LAUGHTER] Why don't you taste it? - Well, you know I'm trying to lose weight. - If I taste it, you'll lose weight. About 210 pounds. [APPLAUSE] Wait a minute. What's that you're putting there? - Oh, I ran out of sugar. That's just saccharine. - Got anything else the government banned to put in my food? [LAUGHTER] - Ralph, listen. I'm in a hurry. I have to run. Now, you just enjoy your meal. - Alice, aren't you even going to say goodbye? - Goodbye, Ralph. Eat everything on your plate. - Alice-- - What? - (SINGING) Yes, we have no bananas. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Eat that, Ralph, and you won't need any bananas. [LAUGHTER] - Hey, Ralphie boy. - I'll be with you in a minute, Norton. I want to see where Alice is going. - Take your time. Take your time. [LAUGHTER] - Mm. Finger-licking good, just like grandma used to make. - Norton! Don't eat that! [LAUGHTER] - Why not? There's enough here for the both of us. Enough here to kill a horse. [LAUGHTER] - Exactly. Alice made that for me. There's poison in it. - Wait a minute. [GASPING] [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Don't drink that! - I know it's $4 a pound, but my life is at stake. - She put something in that, too. - In the coff-- [GASPING] [LAUGHTER] - Norton. Norton. - What is it? - You're about to die. It has to be those mushrooms. I read someplace that you eat poisoned mushrooms and you're dead in three minutes. Norton, you're going to be dead in three minutes. You want me to call Trix? - No, no. Don't call her. She hates it when I eat in between meals. [LAUGHTER] - Norton. - Look, Ralph. I'm going to be dead in three minutes. Even a condemned man has a right to order a last meal, right? [LAUGHTER] Maybe you could, uh, whip me up a three-minute egg or something. [LAUGHTER] - You pool soul. - I know, I know. I'm too young to die. I really haven't seen the shank of the evening. Or the sunset or the sunrise. Or the low tide and the high tide. I haven't even tasted life. - Norton, all I know is you're a good man when you were alive. [LAUGHTER] And don't worry. After you're dead and gone, I'm going to see that you get buried in your raccoon uniform, with all of the raccoons lined up on each side of the casket, humming the raccoon hymn. [LAUGHTER] And then, when it's all over, I personally will escort your remains to the Raccoon National Cemetery in Bismarck, North Dakota. - Ralph, you're a sweet kid. - Wait a minute. Three minutes have got to be up, and you're not dead. Maybe Alice didn't poison it. - Well, why let it go to waste? [LAUGHTER] - You know, she might not have poisoned that. But she's gonna get me. She's gonna get me, all right. And what kills me is that she's going to get me before I can get my hands on that dirty bum, Armand. - How're you going to do that? - Wait a minute. I got an idea. - What? - We'll call him up. We'll make him a date, a date with us, right here. - Well, supposing he doesn't want to go out with guys? [LAUGHTER] - No, you moat. We'll pretend we're girls. You'll call him, and you can talk like a dame, can't you? - Not while Anita Bryant's still around. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - I know human nature. I know human nature. And I know that a bum like that that would go around with somebody's wife will go out with anybody. Now here's what you do. You get him on the phone. - Yeah. - Tell him that you're a lonely widow looking for a little action. Right? - Ralph, I don't want to be lonely widow looking for a little action. I'd rather be a young girl living with her mother. - You haven't got a mother! - I have one now, Mommy. [LAUGHTER] - Oh, no, you don't. Besides, where can I get to dress to fit me? - Well, I'll get Mr. Manicotti, get one of his wife's dresses. Loan it out. We'll have to take it in a little bit, maybe. - Maybe you got something here. Then I can get real close to that bum when I'm about to kill him. Let's make the call. - OK. Wait a minute, Ralph. I was just thinking. Oh, this is the first blind date I've had since Trixie. I hope it turns out a heck of a lot better than that. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] - Farrah Fawcett, eat your heart out. [LAUGHTER] If the fleet's in town, I'm in big trouble. [LAUGHTER] The fleet is in town. Here comes the Queen Mary. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Can I ask you something? May I ask you a simple question? - Yes. - Where did you get these wigs? - The same place Howard Cosell gets his. [LAUGHTER] - Well, they'll have to do. Now, look. [LAUGHTER] On top of everything else, my bra broke. [LAUGHTER] Now, here's our plan. When he gets here, I want you to play up to him. Gain his confidence. And then we'll casually ask him about Alice. - All right. Now, how far do I go to gain his confidence? [LAUGHTER] - As far as you have to. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - I don't even let Trixie go that far. [LAUGHTER] Now, listen, Ralph. I just had a thought. Don't you think this Armand guy's going to little suspicious if he sees my mother with a mustache? [LAUGHTER] - I'm way ahead of you. [LAUGHTER] - Oh, yeah. Big boy, I'm gonna level with you. You're right out of the casbah. If Pepe Rimoco was right here now, he'd fall madly in love with you. - From now on, call me Mother. - All right. Eh, what's my name? - Your name is Virginia. - Eh, I don't feel like a Virginia. I'd rather-- I feel more like a Charlotte. - Your name is Virginia! [LAUGHTER] Now, let me fix your hair. - No, Mother. I'd rather do it myself. [LAUGHTER] - That's him. I'll answer. - Wait a minute. - What? - Your mustache is showing. - Oh. [LAUGHTER] Hello. Hello. And who are you? - I'm Armand. - Oh, you're Armand. This is Armand. - And what is this charming young lady's name? - Oh, Charlotte. - Virginia. [LAUGHTER] Uh, that's her whole name. Virginia Charlotte. She was born on the Mason-Dixon line. [LAUGHTER] My name is Mrs. Finnegan. - Do you, uh, mind if I smoke? - Oh, not at all. - No, I don't. - I, uh, personally don't indulge. - Uh, would you care for one? - Thank you. Thank you. Would you mind flicking your Bic? [LAUGHTER] - I didn't know you smoked, Virginia. - I smoke every day in the sewer. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Pardon me, Armand. I'll get you some hors d'oeurves. - Your mother is a fine figure of a woman. - Oh, Mother is a fine figure of a woman. She owes it all to a Jane Russell bra. [LAUGHTER] - Oh, let's get back to us. - Armand, you're so romantic. You remind me of my first love, Peter. - Who? - Peter. Pita, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza. Oh! [LAUGHTER] - She's so delicate. - If there's one weakness I have it is for delicate women. - Oh. - By the way, Mrs. Finnegan, I don't mean to be presumptuous, but, uh, why are you wearing that veil? - Well, you see, that's to cover up-- - Ah! [LAUGHTER] Eh, I'm wearing it because I'm in mourning. You see, uh, my husband passed away. My husband Abdullah. - Abdullah? - Yes. - Abdullah Finnegan? - Yes. - He was a camel driver. He admired camels very much. - Why? - Well, he admired anything that could drink more than he could. [LAUGHTER] - Uh, enough about us. Eh, Armand, I suppose you have a lot of dates with people. - Mrs. Finnegan, I'll go out with any woman, as long as she pays for it. I'd even go out with an old one, like you. [LAUGHTER] - What are you laughing at? - Mother's really not so old. She's, uh, in excellent health. She has a lot of exercises, gets a lot of sleep, takes a Geritol twice a day. [LAUGHTER] - By the way, I suppose you go out with a lot of different girls. - Yeah, I've been out with them all, from A to Z. Oh, uh, you mean like from Alice to Zelda? - I hope there's not a T in between the A and Z, like a T for Trixie. [LAUGHTER] - Tell me, if you should take out a girl, say for instance one of your Alices, and you went to a Chinese restaurant, who would pick up the tab? - Alice. [SLAPPING] [LAUGHTER] What-- what's what's wrong with your mother? - Well, you see, uh, uh, Father's camel's name was Alice. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Listen, uh, couldn't she go in the other room so that we could be alone? - You want to be alone? Mother, would you leave us alone for a little while? We'd like to be alone. - I'll leave you alone. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Mother really has been so upset, ever since that day somebody knocked on the door and told her that the camel stepped on Father's head. [LAUGHTER] - Yeah? Is he dead? - No, he's still at the zoo. [LAUGHTER] - No, not the camel. - Oh, Daddy died six years before I was born. [LAUGHTER] - You know, I must say you're strange. And your mother's strange. But I find you very attractive. - That makes you strange. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - May I kiss your hand? - You can kiss my-- yes, of course. - Your alabaster hands are only matched by the angelic beauty of your face. - Thank you, Armand. You remind me of my father. You look like his camel. [LAUGHTER] - Well, I-- I don't usually do this. But if you're free tomorrow night, I'll take you to the movies, and I'll pay. - What about your other girlfriends? - Why, they mean nothing to me. I let them wine me and dine me and then I cast them aside like an old shoe. - All right, that's it! [LAUGHTER] So you're going to cast my Alice aside like an old shoe, eh? - What? - Put 'em up! I'm gonna monopolize you! - What's going on here? - You hit him, you got to hit me first, Mother. - Shut up! [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Put 'em up! Put 'em up, you bum! - Are you-- are you his mother? [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - Is that you, Ralph? - Yeah, that's me! And that is Norton! [LAUGHTER] - Yeah. - Ha, ha, ha, ha. - I'm on to you, Alice. I finally caught up with that bum you've been calling on the phone, Armand, and your boyfriend. - Oh, you're Armand? - That voice! You're Alice! - Don't pull that innocent stuff. And for your information, he's already thrown you over. He goes for Norton. [LAUGHTER] - Face it, Alice. Some of us got it, and some of us ain't. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about Armand, your boyfriend. - You think Armand's my boyfriend? Ralph Kramden, I took a job at an answering service to make enough money to buy you your Valentine's Day present. Armand is just one of the clients. He runs an escort service. I bought you this suit with the money that I made, Ralph. Happy Valentine's Day. And here's something else, Ralph. - Alice. You had my baton bronzed. [LAUGHTER] Armand, look-- Alice-- looks like I made a little mistake. Would you mind running along? - Hold it, buddy. Not so fast. I'm a paid escort, and you owe me $20. - Look, pal. If you think I was mad when I thought you were running around with my Alice, just wait'll you see me go when you ask me for $20. - OK! OK! [LAUGHTER] - Out! [APPLAUSE] - [CRYING] [LAUGHTER] [CRYING] - What're you crying about, Norton? - He was gonna take me to the movies tomorrow night. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] - Norton! Everybody can come down. I'm ready! - All right! [MUSIC PLAYING] - Whoa. - Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! - Happy Valentine's, sweetheart. Sit down, everyone, for a memorable evening. - Oh! - Oh, Ralph. - Alice, I'd like you to listen. Listen closely. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can you hear anything? - Not a thing, Ralph. - That's because all the appliances are noiseless. It's the new electric kitchen. And now to turn the furnace up low for that warm glow. Get the toast ready nice and crisp for the cheese spread. Now-- - Oh, Trixie... - Imported Mogen David. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Now, Norton, would you make a little toast that is appropriate for the occasion? - I think I have one. Down the hatch. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] - And now to watch the six o'clock news. Barbara Walters, Harry Reasoner, look out, here we come. [CLICKING] [POPPING] [LAUGHTER] [POPPING] [APPLAUSE] [WHOOSHING] [APPLAUSE] - Eh, Ralph? - What is it, Norton? - I think the toast is burnt. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] - Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Thank you! [APPLAUSE] Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [APPLAUSE] We had a wonderful time here tonight. We hope you did, too. I'd like to introduce our cast. First, Jane Kean! [APPLAUSE] Audrey Meadows! [APPLAUSE] Art Carney! [APPLAUSE] And as usual, the Miami audience is the greatest audience in the world! [APPLAUSE] Good night, everybody. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] - From fabulous Desmond Hall in Miami, Florida, this is Johnny Olson speaking for "The Honeymooners," starring Jackie Gleason, saying good night, everybody.
