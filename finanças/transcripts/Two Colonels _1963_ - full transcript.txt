At the moment in which our story begins, the small town of Montegreco had been occupied by the English for the thirtieth time. And for the thirtieth time, the Italians had to retreat in their trenches, situated at the edge of the valley. We all knew the colonel was overbearing, and he never let anyone step on his feet. When the English attacked us, he again conquered the town within a week. We've been out 20 days and no sign of attacking. Of course. We're short of balls! We've always been short of everything. It's the colonel's fault. He has no sense of economy. When the ammunition arrived, he began shooting as if it were the feast of the town's patron saint! If we don't attack, I'll disguise myself and go alone to town. How will you disguise yourself? With a fig leaf like Adam? It's the signal! - Are we attacking? - Here we go again! They gave me the labor pain signal. - What? - My Tea is about to give birth. Well, well. He went and silently had an Italian-Greek child. I am a serious person and when it all ends here I will marry and settle down. He's crazy! With three mouths to feed... At least he is serene! We've been gone 20 days. His Tea has labor pains, so... I have a fiery woman. How will I know what she's been doing all this time? If we don't attack, I'm going with Fantin. Calm down, boys. The less we go with women, the more energy we save. We must be thrifty. Scrooge, I've 3 women in Montegreco waiting for me with open arms because I am generous! Blossoming flower, don't be stingy with love. Don't put a meter on your heart. Damn you! A lovely boy was born with a big flask in his hand. A lovely boy was born... Attention! Oh, really? We're having fun here! You're singing! You doing the Cafe Chantant! Look at that! Shall we do this war or not? If you don't want to, tell me. I'll write to Mussolini and we'll go home. - I wish! - You'd like that, huh? You are a bunch of lazy bums! Look at that! Get it in your heads that I must win this war. It's a personal matter. I have victory in my blood. At ease! At ease! Do you realize that we've already clobbered the Greeks? If we can clobber them again, we'll take the Piraeus home! Sergeant Major! Sergeant Major! Here I am, Colonel. - Present. - No, you're always absent. Where do you hide? I went to take a look at the grub. - The grub? We're eating today? - Yes, sir! - What are we eating? - Broth. - Chicken broth? - Where would we find a chicken? Vegetable broth. - Vegetable? - Of course! I smell the odor of feathers. - Feathers? - Feather stink. - What are these? - Feathers, Colonel. - A chicken was plucked. - Yes, sir. Who has that bird? Tell me! The boys do what they can. They do what they can? Sergeant Major Quaglia! - Look into my eyes. - They are hungry. It's obvious they do what they can, that stealing a chicken is human. - And so? - But I say... Couldn't they have put aside a drumstick for the colonel? - They must have been distracted. - The colonel eats, too! The colonel has a stomach, too! - Damn them! - Excuse me. Ungrateful men! We'll discuss it after the war. - The battle. I'm attacking today. - What? I'm attacking! I've decided. I'm attacking! - Alright. - Sergeant Major Quaglia! - I need 34 volunteers. - Only 23 are left. - Four will remain home. - Alright. - Excuse me, Colonel. - Very good! I'll propose you for praise. Here's a volunteer. I came to tell you that we can't attack. - What? What? What? - He is a loafer. - Who forbids it? - Someone stole my shoe. - Did you hear, Sergeant Major? - Yes, sir. - The soldiers get their shoes stolen. - It happens. How will I win the war with barefoot soldier? - Go take a foot bath! Go on! - Yes, sir. Stop! Stop! Everyone stop! Everyone stop! My motto is "order and discipline". I expect it, I demand it. Go on, get in a single line! If the English saw you, they'd think you are hungry. - We are hungry! - What's that got to do with it? We are hungry. We haven't received food or ammunition for a year. The enemy must not know. Internal problems are solved in the home. Come on! I will distribute the grub today. Leave it. Come! Who's first? Slowly! Slowly! - The smell is good. Sergeant... - I told you. Excellent. Bravo. Next! Next! - What is your shoe size? - 44. Look. Is this the shoe someone swiped? What is it? You've been back in town for 20 days, and only said 10 words. - Say something! - I am thinking. Oh, thinking! You know what? Italians are great! They talk, laugh, joke around. What do you know about Italians? Nothing. I see them with the other girls in town. When you come, you stick a pipe in your mouth, and only take it out to eat and go to bed. - The pipe is my faithful companion. - Alright! What about me? What? I don't mean anything to you? You are my sweet companion. - Here's your tea. - Thanks, Mom. Many thanks! - If I wasn't in this house... - Really! If Mom wasn't here... The Italians aren't nice. They always surprise us at tea time. What surprise? They conquered the town 30 times and always attack at 5 on the dot. Behind us! Who is it? Go! Attack! Attack! They're hiding. - No. They are finding shelter. - Is it raining? - They are shooting! - It's true! While we... We, nothing! Can we have a war without artillery, tanks, aviation? Without ammunitions? I am using the last 150 bullets, shooting one at a time. - Like at the shooting range. Right! If we hit the bull's eye, the stall lady will come and give us a teddy bear. - What teddy bear? - Your Aunt's! - I don't have aunts. - Be quiet! The enemy is listening. - They care if I've no aunts? They'll make do with your sister! Resist, dear. Don't leave us again in the hands of that terrible Italian colonel. You know we are few, my dear. They are few, too. But they've lots of ammunition for resisting. Attack! Attack, Savoy! Attack! Attack! Go! Go! Go! Go... - Colonel, what are you doing? - Excuse me - I am camouflaged. - You looked like a tree. With all the trees around, you picked this one? - Did you have to be a tree here? - Alright. - Where are you going? - Attacking. - Leave me the tree! - Here it is. Alright! Forget it! They removed the flag! I have victory in my hands. I've defeated the British army. Bravo. Once again, we're leaving. Bye. - Come back soon. - Yes, soon. - The Italians are coming! - Romoletto! - Run! - You should be ashamed! - What a scandal! - Look how they're running! That bastard Italian colonel is coming back. Don't worry. This time I'll slit his throat if I can. He won't have his beard shaved in your place. Don't worry. I will fix him up, one way or the other! The war will end and all the women will return to us! - To you too? - You can't even stand up. Yes, to me too! Go upstairs, hurry! Clere! My beauty! How many times must I tell you that my name is Clara? What did I say? Clere! It's always Clere! - Mariuzza! My Mariuzza! - Love! - Were you innocent with the English? - Yes, Rocco. - Did you save my honor? - How can you doubt me? I doubt everyone. As an old proverb says, "Wives and oxen must come from your country." You are Greek and I don't want to become an ox! - Romoletto! - My chubby girl! I've been waiting so long for you! What's up? Nobody is at home? Let's go. I'll tell you all about it. - Dad! - Luciano! - He's born? - Yes, it's a boy. I'll name him Antonio like my colonel. - Yes. - How is my Tea? One, two! One, two! One, two! Battalion, halt! At ease! - Sergeant Major Quaglia. - Yes, sir! - Where did you put the battalion? - It scattered along the road. - What do you mean? - They are young men and... During our occupation they found welcoming women and are now in their homes. - How is it possible that all Italians must be like that? Homebodies wearing slippers! As soon as they see a welcoming woman, they settle in at home. Good for you. You're the only one who followed his colonel. - I'm settled in farther down. - "Tu quoque"? You too? I can do longer do a triumphant entrance in the occupied town. This is not an occupation army, but an unemployment army! Shall we do this war or not? If you don't, tell me, I'll write to Mussolini and we'll go home! - Alright? Sergeant Quaglia! - Yes, sir. Gather your men and make them work. Make out a list of those who collaborated with the English. Identify the traitors, arrest the instigators, the newsmonger, the saboteurs. I want to give an example, show them who Colonel Antonio Di Maggio is! Be hard on them! Be hard on them! Tough! - Sergeant! - Yes, sir? - Snap to it! - Yes, sir. - Snap to it! Go! - I am snapping, sir. - Damn it! - Lapadula! Calascione! Mazzetta! Parodi! Where are the soldiers? Where were you hiding? - Antonio, dear. Finally. - What a fright! - Dear Antonio, how are you? - Terrible. Awful. I am famished. What's there to eat? - Actually... - What? What? I told you a thousand times! When you see us occupying the town, you must prepare food for us. After 30 days in the trench fasting, I come here and don't even find a slice of ham. - No more ham. - We have the usual beet soup. You'll eat the beets, ugly witch! Please, next time I occupy the town, don't have me find your mother. - What should I do? Kill her! Push her off a cliff, whatever you want. - What are you saying? - What am I saying? What am I saying? Darn! I smell a pipe. Someone smoked here. Penelope! Someone smoked here! You took in the English again. Dear Antonio, you know that when the colonel returns to town, he always confiscates the tavern. - He sets up his command here. - I didn't even look at his face. - You shouldn't! That lanky British guy! - You must believe her. - Don't touch me! Do you have a disinfectant? Boric acid? Look at what aspiring mother-in-law I get stuck with. Why do I do it? To have a companion like you. Maybe! It's obvious. No food for me. In this home we don't eat. Having a home, having a roof... What need is there? I am the commander of the occupying army troops. So I have a right to confiscate. Penelope, I am confiscating! - What do you expect from us? - To collaborate for victory. You have the pleasure of having the English colonel, my enemy, and you don't sabotage him? You don't attempt an assault? - We are two women, alone! - Don't be blasphemous. One woman, alone, your daughter. She is young, beautiful, fresh. But not you. You're a scarecrow, a cursed witch. Die! To death! Hey! Die! Enough! What could we do? - We couldn't poison him. - Yes. You could've done it with the tea, or clobbered him with a hammer. Strangled him in his sleep, put a bomb in the bathroom flusher. So in flushing, he'd explode! But no collaboration. How can I win the war? Majesty, I am alone against all of Great Britain. - Who am I? - Who are you? You are... - You're my chubby girl. - Yes, but what is my name? I'll tell you, but take away your hands. They're bothering me. - You'll keep your eyes closed? - I promise. Alright. Turn around. Embrace me and give me a kiss. You think I don't recognize you? You always want to joke around. I recognize you. Where are you? Romoletto's chubby girl! Mazzetta! How dare you kiss your colonel? - And in what way! - Sir, I care for you. Oh, come on! You are disgusting! Is this the way to kiss? Mazzetta! Get out of here! I don't want to see you again! - Yes, sir. - Go! Sergeant Major Quaglia! Boric acid! This is an abuse! It is my pharmacy. - Who gave you the order? - Shut up! Don't move! Colonel, the confiscation has been carried out. We found these crates in the basement. - What is it? - Nothing. Some firecrackers and pinwheels. - They are fireworks. Fireworks? You know what they are made of? Gunpowder. - For the patron saint's feast. - Feast, my foot! Such a quantity is enough to have an entire railway station blow up. - There isn't a railway station here! What if there had been one? Blaster! Saboteur! - Take them away. - No! - I am a family father! - You remember now that you are? The first time I occupied the town, who made that noise with his mouth? You weren't a family father then, huh? - We paid for that. - You purged me 12 times. - Too little! Too little! - I can't stand it anymore. You made me eat tons of soap! - Too few. Take them away! - Colonel... - Go! - What'll we do with them? Shoot them for the time being. Then we'll discuss it. I am inflexible! I am... Gunpowder! Got that? What a torment! Thanks heavens. Instead of shooting us he has us run. He's having us do 20 rounds of the town. I'll die anyway. - Run! Run! - We're running! We're running. What're you doing? Sitting? Get up! Run! It's your punishment! - Please, Colonel, enough. - I can't stand it anymore! I have a weak heart. It's not true. Just an excuse. Go! Run! It's your punishment. Go on! Run! Go! Go! Kalispera. Kalispera. We are alone in the evening and your mouth tastes like spring. - Keep calm, Rocco. - I can't. Don't you feel how I'm suffering? Why did I have to get a toothache tonight? My Mariuzza! Dear, when the war ends, will you take me to Beri? Not "Beri"! It's called "Beri"! With an A. On your hair I will place my lips, and will say to you "S'agapò", love. A beautiful song! Our love will stop the night, the sky and the earth for the eternity. - My love, I love you so much! - You like me, huh? Did you know they call me "lovable"? Give me a kiss. When I'm with you, I feel like a general. - Why? - Because of the Greek symbol. Romoletto's lovely chubby girl! Finally you're here! You were to take over a half hour ago. Leave me alone! I spent the whole night with a toothache. It's gone now, but my head still feels heavy. - I understand. - What are you getting at? Well... good night. Yeah, good night, with such a heavy head? Iride! Iride! Timothy! - What're you doing? Are you mad? - I forgot the pipe. For a pipe you risk becoming a prisoner? It's not a pipe... it's my pipe! - Wait. - Yes. Hurry! Hurry! Here. You'd forgotten it on the table. I can't move. Put the pipe in my mouth. - Thank you. - Hurry. Go! Go! Let me in. I'll leave at dawn. Heavens, no! The colonel could come any minute. The colonel goes into your room? What are you thinking? To bid me good night. He's in the bathroom. What a day! I need to rest. - You're here! - You aren't sleepy, are you? - Just a bit tired. - Tired? What should I say? I'm at war every day! My Mariuzza! What a migraine! My head feels so heavy! Darn it! It's an English migraine! Excuse me! Every time I see you, you're prettier. More lovely. - Turn off the light. - Why is it that we must turn off the light every time? - Please, go on. - Alright. I'll turn it off. Promise me as usual that you won't turn it on? - I won't turn it on. - Your colonel's word? I am a military! - Excuse me a moment, dear. - Where are you going? I have to ask Mom something. Why? Your mother didn't explain... - Silly! - These Greek women! Colonel! Colonel Di Maggio! This time I deserve a medal. - What is it? - I captured the English colonel. Really? The English colonel? Finally! He is in my hands now! Keep him warm. I'm coming and want to eat him alive! Colonel! My patience has a limit. With your obstinate silence you are reducing it to shreds. Don't speak that language! Speak Italian. Answer my questions. I want to know where the main part of your forces are. Colonel Timothy Henderson, rifleman of His British Majesty. Number 874051. You're trying to make a fool of me! I didn't ask for the phone number. I want to know where and when you'll receive arms, backup, provisions. - Especially provisions! - Colonel Timothy Henderson. Rifleman of His British Majesty. Number... Put down that pipe and don't try fooling me! Otherwise, you'll oblige me to use coercive measures, and that will be too bad for you! Darn it! According to the Geneva Convention, a prisoner is not obliged to give information to the enemy. My friend! My friend! I don't give a darn about the Geneva Convention. Put the pipe down! - You are torturing a prisoner. - Really? I torture prisoners? Don't say it again! Don't say it around, or I'll break a chair over your head! Put that pipe down! Obey! - You see? Torture. - What? I am torturing you? Yes. You're denying a prisoner the comfort of his pipe. According to the Geneva Convention... I am getting sick of this Geneva Convention. It doesn't not talk about pipes belonging to colonels. With that disgusting pipe in your mouth, you're making me nervous. I ask the questions, and you must answer! What is your answer? What? Right away? Is it urgent? Answer before the question. If it is urgent... "V" stands for victory. It's Churchill's sign. Really? I don't give a darn! Okay, Colonel. The only information I can give you is that we will win the war. Laugh! You laugh because you don't know the password. There is only one password. Categorical and committing for everyone. It is travelling from the Alps to the Indian Ocean, lighting up hearts. Win! We will win! We will transform... We'll transform your small island of fishermen into a marine colony for the Fascist children. We'll loiter around Piccadilly! And we'll substitute the guards at Buckingham Palace with circus midgets. - Colonel! Take that! - Enough! You've gone beyond the limit. I'm going to sleep. Accompany me to my accommodation. This is your accommodation. Don't joke with me! The Geneva Convention says I have a right for an accommodation that is on my level. Really? You even want a respectful accommodation? With all comforts included? 3 bathrooms and an elevator? Shall I bring you coffee in bed tomorrow morning? Thank you, but I prefer tea with a big English breakfast. You've got rocks in your head. You think prison life is a holiday? That war is a picnic? I'll have you eat bread and water! - Bread and water? - And if you irritate me, only water! Rinse yourself with it. He crossed the Channel! He wants to loiter around Piccadilly! Go! Go! This must serve as a warning for who collaborates with the English. This is how we punish the vile collaborators! Hey, you! Do something so that vile head be shaven completely. - It already is! Silence! I think it's too long. Cut it below zero. Understand? Alright! With what heart do you have us run like this? - Run! Run! - My heart! - Carry out your punishment! - Colonel! We have ended the roundup of collaborators. - Good. - There's been a complication. - Not good. - We can't punish that man. - Is he favored by someone? - No. Calascione, come! Here he is. - What is it? - He doesn't have hair. - Cut his beard. - Alright. - Go! - Colonel... - What is it? Even who doesn't have a beard? Mazzetta, we just cut hair! Remember that! - Understand? - Yes, sir! - Lapadula! - Yes, sir? - Where is Sergeant Quaglia? - In the attic preparing the tub for the prisoner. - What? The tub? Yes, sir. He brought all he needs for shaving his "bead". What is "bead"? You mean "beard"? Speak Italian! The prisoner is appealing to the Geneva Convention. Really? He's appealing to the Geneva Convention? I'll show you what he can appeal to! Go away! What a lovely voice, Colonel! - Thank you. - A lovely voice! - Not too warm. - Okay, don't worry. The right temperature. - What? - Right temperature. Neither too hot nor too cold. Halfway. That voice... is a baritone one, huh? - Very well. - Bravo. What a lovely voice! Sergeant Quaglia! You think I'm a mosquito or horsefly? - What language are you speaking? - English. It's forbidden to speak English! Am I speaking it? - You don't know English! - Silence! - Darn it! - The sergeant is doing his duty. - What is he saying? - He'll hatch an egg now. Article one of the Geneva Convention establishes a fundamental principle. The prisoner's life is sacred. This place is full of cockroaches and I saw some scorpions too. Scorpions are poisonous. If I die, you will be a war criminal. - Me? I could bust my head! - Easy! Quaglia, did you hear? The colonel is slandering me. No, he said to stick to the Geneva pacts. Really? We have transformed this prison into a hotel! Soap, baths, beard, sprays! Did you put talcum on the kid? - Not yet. - What does "talcum" mean? He wanted to know if you'd put powder on. - What did he say? - Comb. He crossed the Channel for a comb? Sergeant Quaglia, you're acting as a butler to this lanky guy. - It's our duty. The Convention... - Stop with this Convention! We know how you respect it and how you treat prisoners. Really? Excellently. Sergeant Quaglia! Attention! Tell him how this gentleman treated you when you were made a prisoner. Tell him! - Well... - Well, what? My foot! I know how you mistreated him. At ease. It's not true. It's not true? And the torture to get him to talk? Salt in his mouth? Water with a dropper? Tickling his stomach? Your finger in his eye? Hammering his feet? This poor, miserable man, not in good health, who was disgusting even before the war, had to be sent to the back ways to cure him and nurture him because when he managed to reach us, he was swaying and couldn't stand. His legs folded underneath him. And if you will notice, they still do! - Am I a horse? - Attention! Understand? He couldn't stand up because the night he ran away he drank all of our whisky. Sergeant Quaglia! What're you doing? Beating it? - I have something important to do. - You don't want to force the lies of the enemy down his throat? - Let's forget it... No, we need to talk. He who is silent, agrees. - Exactly. Sergeant Quaglia. - Yes, Colonel? On your honor as a soldier, honestly, did I mistreat you? He'll lay another egg now! It's the truth! I was treated very well. I ate what they ate. They gave me everything. Wine, liqueurs, whisky, tea, cigarettes. - Packs? - Yes! Sergeant Quaglia, you lied to me, knowing you were lying. It's the truth. I did it to have a license after a long time. If I hadn't done it, I'd never have been given a leave of absence. Silence! Colleague... You got that, colleague? He lied. He acted like a hero, he acted like a victim. But he spent 2 months as a prisoner with "tarallucci" and whisky. - And you believed him? - Of course. He was staggering. - What? - His legs folded backwards. Who is it? - Soldier Parodi reporting, sir. - Come in. - What is it? - This old lady says she has an important communication. - Did you search her? Is she armed? - She's clean. Go ahead, speak up. Just a moment! The enemy is listening. Come here. What is it? Is it possible they dared hide them in this home? Parodi! Take this being away. - Sergeant Quaglia! - Yes, sir? Send backup right away. Surround the house. Close the door, open your eyes. Nobody out! - Run! Penelope! Penelope! - Here I am. - Speak up! Where are you hiding him? - I know nothing. Who do you mean? - He's in your room! - It's not true! - Parodi! Knock down the door! - Your mother-in-law is in there. Knock her down too! Go on! No! Let me go! Let me go! Antonio, please! I care for you. I don't give a darn. Here it is! You got it! In the kitchen with pots and pans. Scoundrel! While my soldiers were starving to death, you were hiding this pig! - What is it? - You didn't know? You gave me vegetable soup while your mother was hiding that pork of a pig! She'll get the lesson she deserves. Soldier Parodi! - Beard and hair. - No! Not my hair. - Beard, hair and superfluous hairs. - Not my hair! Shave her! Shave her! As retaliation, I'll shave the whole town. I swear to that, or I'm not Colonel Antonio Di Maggio! Present. - Look for the wave. - It's here. - The sync? - That, too. I hear perfectly. What are you doing? Don't put the listening on the headphones. I must hear. I am the colonel, right? Your attention! Your attention! The headquarters of the armed forces communicates: Rome July 25, 1943. His Majesty the King Emperor accepted resignation of the head of the government, by His Excellency Cavaliere Benito Mussolini. Crazy things are going on! As head of the government he nominated Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio. The war is over! Guys, we're going home! - To your place. Don't get friendly! - The war is over. - Who said the war is over? - The radio. - It didn't say it. - Then I'm saying it. Who are you? Quaglia? Silence! - Silly Quaglia! - How can it go on? This is a Fascist war. If Mussolini resigned, the war has no reason to exist. - He will be substituted by the Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio. I don't believe the war will continue. That's bad. We must believe, obey and fight. Go on! He accepted resignation and nominated as head of the government Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio. I am happy for him. Dear Pietro! They're repeating the communication. Now they'll say the war is over. The war continues next to the German allies. I'm happy! The war continue next to the German allies. There you go! You are somewhat of a jinx. - What did you say? - Excuse me. It slipped. I heard you. I'm not a jinx. - It slipped. - It must not slip! Jinx to me? I don't mean to boast, but I had an uncle with a nice hunchback that everyone touched. - You didn't inherit it! - What are you saying? - That the radio doesn't work. - Repair the radio! Why should I bother now? - Excuse me! Did you hurt yourself? - Of course! - My finger! - Let's soak it. Sergeant Quaglia! This is a historical moment. - We can't worry about soaking it. - Yes, sir. Look here. What matters is that the war continues. I have war in my blood. For me it's an open invitation. - I am a warmonger! - It's continuing? - How will we fight? - It's broken. The situation is nosediving and you joke around. Without ammunition or provisions, how will we continue? - Sergeant Quaglia! - If the English attack us, will we answer with a sling? - Sergeant Quaglia! I am surprised at you. You know that Italian soldiers make do. Punches, slaps, kicks, pinches, bites, head blows. What matters is that the English leave us alone for a while. Yeah, sure, they'll leave us in peace! They heard the communication and will attack us immediately. Did you hear? What do you say? - I say that you are the jinx! - Me? - Me, the jinx? - Go jump in the lake! Sir, the English have occupied the first houses of the town. - Join your companions. Yes, sir. - What'll we do now? - Resist! Resist, how? The soldiers have 50 bullets in all! - Sergeant Major Quaglia. - Yes, sir? I order you to order immediately a strategic retreat. Don't waste time trying to save on ammunition. - Yes, sir. - Go! What are you doing? Not coming with us? - You want to leave everything? - I don't understand. We have the English colonel prisoner upstairs. I can't leave the town with him inside. Remember... - No, you remember! The other finger. - Right, this one! Remember that I care about my war prey. Very much! - But I will do to him what I decide. - Yes, sir. I'll take the prisoner and join you. March! Go! Right at the best moment. Darn the war, the English, retreats! - Goodbye, Romoletto. - Goodbye? We'll meet again. Come on, boys! The English are in town. Let's go! Take care of Tea and the baby. I can't stand it anymore! Up and down. I lost 10 kilos! Colonel, follow me. Don't protest. Whether you like it or not, you must follow me. Understand? Even if I have to carry you. You are very kind, Colonel, but it's better if you carry me piggy-back. Don't be funny, and remember that this is a historical moment. Who is he? Hey! Well, my dear Colonel. This is really a historical moment! Our positions have been inverted. Therefore... Now you are my prisoner. Dear Colonel, one must be patient. These are the phases of history. Once to me, once to you. One time each doesn't hurt anyone. Patience! What can we do? Get moving! Raise those heels! Come on, loafers! When we retreat, we run. Yes, and when we attack, we go slowly. What are you insinuating? Leave me alone. I'm in a bad mood today. You Roman, don't joke. Joke? The English are here right at the culminating moment! It's always the culminating moment for you. Go on! Get moving! Don't save on steps, too. - I'm saving energy. - Move! - What are you mumbling? - Patience, sir. - I have my reasons. - Is the radio heavy? No, but 4 nights with a toothache, three nights as a sentinel. Last night we had to run away and I couldn't say goodbye to her. - Well? - She'll open her arms to the first Englishman she meets. - You should be thankful. You got rid of her. Get moving! Go on! Sergeant, aren't we waiting for the colonel? We're not waiting for him. Colonel, goodbye! Colonel, how are the forces of the Axis set up in Greece? Colonel Antonio Di Maggio of the XXVII infantry regiment. - I can't remember the number. - Then I'll talk. - You have my number? - This is the situation. The Germans are concentrating the heavy artillery on the coast. - Well, well! - They've transported the cannons to Peloponnese. - Are you sure? - Very sure. I'll tell you even more. The Italian army in Greece will be commanded by Germans. - How do you know? - We have good informers. Nobody informs me! How will I win the war? I don't know. The enemy receives secret news before I do. - Why do you get angry? - It gets on my nerves! The blood goes to my head. I am Latin, volcanic. - We have efficient informers. - Ours are idiots! See what impression I make? You know everything, and I know nothing. And yet I am the colonel! I should know these things! What sort of colonel am I? I will get undressed! - I agree. - Thanks God! See? This is a man to man talk, with loyalty and sincerity. Tell me something, Colonel. Is your command planning to take action on the Balkans. The Balkans intrigue me very much! Why are you moving away? Do I have scabies? The allies aren't interested in the Balkans. - What if the Germans arrive? - Ready reserves. - Where? - I don't know. Come on, colleague! Don't keep me guessing. Tell me. You are keeping me on hot coals. Let's not behave like children. We are colonels. And you are so tall! Where are they? Tell me. Dear Colonel, we are not in your club here. Don't forget that you're my prisoner. So I ask the questions! If you use that tone, you know what I'll do? A prisoner is not obliged to answer. I'll close myself in silence and retire in the attic. Not in the attic. You have a bedroom. What? I had you sleep... - I respect the Convention. - I see. You want to humiliate me. Well, I accept and turn the other cheek. - Go ahead. - I don't understand. Dear colleague... I am ashamed to say it. I've a sentimental situation that is a bit morganatic. If you don't mind, I'd like to sleep with my wife. With my woman. - Impossible. You can't go out. - Who wants to go out? My morganatic situation is here. Your woman is here? Colonel, what's there to laugh about? The fact is, my woman is here too. Really? Yours here too! Colonel, I'm sorry to say it, but you are a good military, and look good in a uniform, But have good tastes! Yes, my woman is very nice! - Really? - Dear... Who would ever imagine that you are my father-in-law! I don't understand. Father-in-law. - Me? Father-in-law? - Yes! Just a moment, Colonel. Let's not confuse things. We have to make things clear. You're the husband of Penelope's mother. Me? Are you kidding? Me, with Penelope? He's an idiot! Then who is your woman? It's clear, isn't it? Iride! - Iride is my woman! - No! - Yes! - Darn! Colonel, I am beginning to think you and I formed a nice couple of cuckolds. You think? Darn! - No! No! - Yes! - No! - Yes! Listen to a friend. In fact, an enemy. That's how it is. Understand? - Did they find everything out? - Yes, I heard them. They're coming! - Explain yourself. - Yes, we want an explanation. You two must explain to me. What does this intrusion mean? There's a reason! Did you betray both of us? Tell the truth! Betray? You're the betrayers! You come as allies and take the women. You come as enemies and take the pigs. Be quiet, Radames! Who can deny a favor without expecting the worst to happen? What can a poor woman who loves her husband and can't say no to you, do? Husband? - You are married? - Yes. Colonel! Then there are three cuckolds! - Yes. - Ruffian! Amazing! Now stop it! I know what we went through. I had to hide him to avoid that you hurt him. You want to see him? Here he is. Here's my husband. A cuckold with a beard! My daughter never betrayed her husband. Then who was betrayed? I don't understand. - Maybe he doesn't know anything. - It's not true! I've always known everything. Iride remained faithful to me. Yeah! Iride told us jokes at night! It wasn't her. I came at night to tell you jokes! - What? - Right! Were we blind? - You were in the dark. - Darn! Yes! Yes! Yes! That's why you always wanted to turn the candles out when we were embracing! - She turned off the light with you? - Every time. Now I know why as soon as the light went out with an excuse she went to her mother. And her mother, who is a shrewd one, came to us and told us the so-called jokes. That's right! I sacrificed myself to save my daughter's honor. Really? No. I think the colonel and I made the biggest sacrifice. Colonel, if this should be known, they'll give us a medal for how brave we've been. - Look... - Well, Penelope, my compliments! - You made it! - No! It won't end here! Remember! Next time that I conquer the town again, I won't limit myself to cutting hair. I'll do other cuts. You understand, darn witch? As for you, remember, you scoundrel, that I don't want to see you again! - I agree! Enough, Colonel. We don't want to see you. Really? It's becoming hard to breathe in this house. - Mephitic air! - Mephitic... Colonel, I've decided. This house is disgusting. I've decided. I'm leaving and won't set foot in this house again. - Goodbye! - I don't blame you. Hey! Colonel, where are you going? - Come here! - Please, let me go. - I've decided. - Where do you want to go? Please don't insist. I have to go. Are you kidding? You're forgetting that you're my prisoner. If you keep me in this house... I know myself. I've an ugly character. I'll cause a commotion, a massacre! Silence! Private affairs are one thing, the war law is another. When facing laws, the rest doesn't matter. - Even when cheating is involved? - Enough! - You put war before cheating? - Enough! Enough! - Now come with me. - Okay. Doctor! We heard that that scoundrel Colonel Di Maggio didn't escape in time. - Really? Yes! He was late in taking Colonel Henderson with him. And the English took him as a prisoner. Great! Finally he's in our hands! No, unfortunately, he's in the hands of the English. They'll send him to a prison camp and we can't do anything. - It would be too convenient! - He must pay! - Right! - For the running he made us do! - What can we do? - Advise the others and have him delivered to us. - I am with you! Let's go! - Let's go! - We'll have fun now. Enough whisky! To forget Iride! - To forget Iride! Cheers! - Cheers. Who do we want to forget now? Margareth? Who is she? Cheers to Margareth! I loved Margareth very much. She left me for the bishop. - During the procession? - No. - She loved her. - No! - Yes. - Oh! Wow! The bishop gave in to her? They got married. What? A shepherd of the souls steals a girlfriend from a colonel and marries her illegally? No. In England the clergy can marry. Priests and bishops are Protestant. Really? That's a good one! I didn't know. If they found out in Italy, everyone would protest! - To Mussolini! - Yes. - To forget Mussolini! - No! No! I don't agree! - I do! Look! - I won't look. I won't look. To forget Churchill! I will gulp it down. Believe me, colleague. It's a pleasure to spend a half hour with you! I'll tell you something that may seem absurd. I thank this war that gave me the chance to meet you. Otherwise, how would I have met you? Maybe we would have met just the same. A long time ago I came to Italy to study singing. - Really? - Yes! Baritone. - Beautiful voice. - Baritone. Barber! We'll have him delivered and will hang him. - I will beat him first. - Good! Boys, they are making fools of us. Let's call the colonel! - Give us the colonel! - They want you. - Give us that bastard! - Oh, they want me! - Let us by or you'll regret it! - We want justice! - What do you want? - Give us the prisoner. - The colonel is my prisoner. - He is our prisoner! - It's up to us to punish him! - What are we waiting for? Let's go inside and take him away. Let's hang him! - Stop! You are all crazy! - If you don't give him to us, we'll come get him! - Yes! Yes! Try it and you'll regret it! I want to see if you have the courage to shoot on the population. Listen. I will first question the prisoner, and then we'll see. Colonel Henderson, we'll give you until tomorrow morning. Then we'll take action our way. - Bravo! - We'll wait until tomorrow. What'll we do? We must take action! - Please! - "Please" my foot! You're crazy! We're dealing with my hide, and you speak English? Enough! Sit down, please. I always get in trouble because of you. Why do they hate you so much? What did you do? Yes! I shaved beards and hair to some men, I gave the pharmacist cod liver oil, and other little things. Why, for heaven's sake? They made the fart noise and I am touchy. What can I do in so little time? They'll be back tomorrow. I only have a few men and can't shoot at those good people. Those people? They're scoundrels! Those miserable people need a good lesson! Sergeant! Close the doors and open fire! Silence! I give the orders here! And I won't shoot anyone! - Let's use our head. - Alright. You obliged me. You asked for it. I've decided. I'll hang. The neck is yours. Hang yourself if you want. What did you understand? I'll hang on to the Geneva Convention. You should remember it because you hang on to it, too. Now you brush it off, and don't give it any importance, but in the Geneva Convention article one says, "The life of the prisoner is sacred." Sacred. Who is it? Take your jacket off. - Why? - Take your jacket off! Now take off your pants. - No! - Go on. Don't worry. I am worrying. Colonel! I said to take off your pants. - Sergeant, the English! - Calm down! Calm down! We'll welcome them as is fit. Don't worry. How? We have at the most 30 bullets! If need be, we'll know how to defend ourselves with rocks. Sergeant Quaglia won't surrender. How many are they? - I only saw the colonel. - Got that? They want to attack me with forces. They want to defeat me. Go to your place! They know the commander isn't here and said, "Sergeant Quaglia is beating it." But they are wrong! Boys, charge the rifles. Let's go! Let's charge the rifles! Go slowly. Nobody is chasing you. - Where was the English colonel? - He was coming down from that rock. Wait before shooting. Don't waste ammunition. Only shoot when you're sure of hitting. Sergeant, who are we shooting at? I don't see anyone. He says he saw him. Unless he's blind. - Are you blind? - No. Did you hear? He saw him. Go back to your place. You, Lapadula, come here. Here he is! He was right. It's him. It's Colonel Henderson. I can tell from the cap and pipe. - Sergeant, I don't see the soldiers. - Must be hiding behind the rocks. I am never wrong. If we get rid of the English colonel, they will retreat. You'll see! Let him get closer. When I give the order, shoot. San Gennaro, you take care of it! Be ready. Fire! Don't shoot! It's me! - It's our colonel! - San Gennaro, well? - Sergeant, now it's your tough luck! - How could I know? He's disguised! - Sergeant Quaglia! - Yes sir! I'm coming. Let's dig a grave for the sergeant. The colonel will massacre him! Scoundrel, miserable rogue! Shooting at your colonel! Sir, I saw you coming dressed as an Englishman. Quaglia, remember that I'm a warrior. For war needs, I can be dressed in any way, even as a priest! I would never shoot a priest. All we need is to declare war on the Vatican! Look here! You risked killing me. - It's nothing. - A hole in the pants. Lie on the bed, stomach down, and take off your pants. Sure! Now you're looking at the colonel's rear end! I'm doing it so you won't worry. I assure you that nothing happened. It's just a hole in the pants. The bullet nicked you. - You're dogged. - Dogged? In what way? - You've been dodged! - I heard. You said, "dogged". - Dodged! - Remember... I'm the one who dodges bullets! Not them! - Soldier Quaglia! - Soldier? I'm Sergeant Major. - I degraded you. - Why? For having ordered fire without saying "Who goes there?" - I didn't do it on purpose. - Silence! You almost killed me. On the contrary, the English colonel saved my life. - Henderson saved your life? - Yes. Because those dear townspeople wanted to lynch me. The English colonel gave me his uniform to let me escape. This is just between you and me, but he gave me his pipe! Quaglia! - This is a pipe, not an eel! - I saw that. I removed the spots and ironed it personally. You want something else? Our surveillance aircraft established that on Montegreco the English flag is still waving. - Is it possible? Who's in Montegreco? - The 27th infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Di Maggio. - Di Maggio... I want to remember the name of this colonel who after many months hasn't yet been able to defeat the last enemy resistance. General Von Kiplinz, I remind you that on the Greek front the Italian troops never had efficient means to fight the enemy. The usual complaint. We'll take care of this Montegreco. If I may, General, I will personally take care of this operation. Bravo, Herr Kruger. You have carte blanche. - It's around here. - Is it English? - The sound seems German. - Sergeant! - What is it? - A German plane launched parachutes. - Men? - One man and big cases. - I think it's provisions. - Finally we'll eat! - Where is it? - On the clearing behind the cave. Good! Let's go see. Advise the colonel. Let's hope for the best! - Heil Hitler! Major Kruger. - Colonel Di Maggio. As always, the German forces come to your rescue. Thank you. Did you bring provisions? They brought enormous cases full of provisions. Thank you. Finally my men can eat! No food! There are weapons in the cases. They were parachuted with powerful mortars to find the English. Order the men to get assemble them. Sergeant! - Follow the colonel's orders! - I didn't say anything. - I said it! I've carte blanche. - Quaglia, did you understand? - The major has carte blanche. - He has carte blanche. - Tomorrow Montegreco will disappear. - Jawhol! We'll totally destroy the town before The English backup arrives tomorrow. Now I must check assembling of the mortars. Your mortar. Did you understand, Quaglia? - Their mortars! - German mortars! Your family's mortars. German family. Our mortars! At dawn they will be ready. At 6 o'clock, fire! Montegreco kaput! English kaput! Greeks kaput! That way we'll end this matter! Hurry! There isn't much time! These pieces are the stands! - Have you finished? - Sergeant, what'll we do? - I don't know. - Why the townspeople? What do you want from me? Orders are order. Perk up, Fantin! I understand. Don't worry. Maybe everything will work out. What’re you doing? "Schnell"! This goes on the ground. "Schnell"! - They're always in a hurry. - What did you say? - Nothing. I translated "schnell". - If you understand "schnell", hurry! Quaglia! What're you doing? Observing a moment of silence? Don't look at me with those sad dog eyes! - What do you want? Speak up! - Know what I'd like to say, sir? If it's about the rank matter, don't worry. I'll re-integrate you. You're again Sergeant Major Quaglia. - I wasn't thinking of that. - Of what, then? You seem evil but deep down you are kind. No. This misunderstanding must be cleared. I am totally evil. What is it? Colonel, may I ask you something? - Go ahead. - At 6... - What'll the mortars? - What they should. What else? - Will they shoot? - Of course they'll shoot! You want them to do the mortar dance? Aren't you thinking about the Montegreco people? I am! They wanted to lynch me. It's true, but... there are women and children too. And don't forget that the English saved your life. Right! I'll get them a bouquet of flowers, a best wishes telegram, some sweets. Quaglia! Remember that in war there are situations in which an officer must behave as the English colonel did with me. And situations in which an Italian colonel must do what he is ordered... - The Germans! - The Germans are our allies! - Did you hear the radio? - But they are Germans! Quaglia! You want to break the Axis? - What will I tell those boys? - That at 6 we're shooting. - Alright. - Sergeant Major, to your position. Yes, sir! The mortars are ready. Only a few minutes. Are you ready? - Very ready. - Let's go. Company, attention! 30 men plus one. - At ease. - At ease. Stop looking at me like that! You're bothering me! You're making me nervous! I know what you want to tell me with those eyes. - Only three minutes. - Jawhol! Did you hear the major? You must look at him, not me. He has carte blanche. I didn't even have carte blanche for writing home. Only 2 minutes and 30 seconds left. Darn! I know that up there there are women, children, old people, et cetera, et cetera. But I'm a soldier! I am not a charity lady. I'm ordered to shoot, and I shoot. - Be ready! - Major Kruger! - I give orders to my soldiers! - Then do so! Whenever I decide! I am your superior. I came with full powers! - Two minutes left. - How much longer? - One minute and 55 seconds. - Who gives a darn! Yes! I won't shoot against a helpless town. Evacuate it and then I'll have the mortars sing. That is nonsense! - The action depends on the surprise. - I don't do such surprises! I am a soldier! I am not a murderer. What's the life of 200 people matter compared to the Reich's victory? - They are like flies. - I won't even kill a fly! I won't give the order to shoot now or never! Watch out, Colonel. I have carte blanche. You can clean your ass with it! So, Kruger, make out your deposition. At dawn as was established all the mortars were aimed at Montegreco. When I told him that firing was one minute away, he answered, "Who gives a darn!" Di Maggio, what can you say for yourself? - Nothing. - What? If you want to hear what I said to the major, I can repeat it. I suggest you change attitude when facing this court. I don't acknowledge it! I have a right to be judged by an Italian court. Germany is allied with Italy. So this is a competent court. Competent in judging a man who didn't want to carry out a useless massacre? We were to conquer the town with cannons. We conquered it with white arms. Isn't it the same? The order was to totally destroy the town. You didn't obey. On the contrary, you had Herr Kruger arrested when he was following my orders. Do you deny that? No. I had him arrested because I dislike him as a man. As a German, even more! You hate Germans! Say it that you hate Germans! It's not true. I love them. An example. At home in Naples on my nightstand I've a photo of Hitler. Every evening before going to bed, I tell him lots of nice words. You tell him things? Sometimes even bad words! The accused is making fun of our Fuhrer! General, we can't accept it! And I can't afford this clown trial. Let's end it! I was given the order to have Montegreco explode. I didn't do it. So what? I'll personally pay. Without a burden on my conscience. I would now have on my conscience Fantin's son, Calascione's wife, the Mazzetta girls and all of my soldiers, Henderson, the English colonel who saved the life of an enemy. While you, as allies, want to take it away from me. Take this disgusting life, if you care so much. Jackals! Colonel! You are going beyond the limit. As you know, this court, based on the laws of the war, gives me the right to judge you and carry out the sentence at once. The stand to the prosecution. The defense? In the name of the Fuhrer, this court sentences Colonel Antonio Di Maggio to immediate degradation and the death penalty by firing squad. The sentence will be carried out tomorrow at dawn. They condemned him to death. Tomorrow they'll shoot him. - He disobeyed orders. - Was he to kill all of us? It was his duty. Emotions are a wonderful thing, but you pay for them in war. - What would you have done? - Would you have shot? Without second thoughts. I'm a soldier, not a philanthropist. You're not a philanthropist but as a soldier you can attack tonight. It's not possible. We are waiting for backup. But the German soldiers are very few. It's not a matter of numbers, but of orders. You've conquered the town many times without orders. I only take initiatives when there are no orders. The order now is to wait for backup. In the end, he saved your life. But I saved his, too. Think it over carefully before saying no. I did think it over carefully. The Germans are enemies. The Italians are enemies. Therefore... If you want to kill one another, what can I do? Nothing. You are right. Maybe I am wrong. I'm very sorry. Believe me. Sergeant! Put your men in front of the condemned man. - But... - In front of the condemned man. Attention! Left flank! Forward! Step! One, two. One, two. One, two. Halt! Right flank. Right! Sergeant, you will command the firing squad. - We must shoot him? - Yes. You Italians will shoot your colonel. Give the order. Sergeant, give the order! If you don't shoot, you will be shot! Major! I ask for the privilege of commanding the firing squad for me execution. Go ahead, Colonel. Firing squad, attention! Charge! First row, on your knees. Aim! Long live Italy! Long live the King! Fire! I said fire! Fire! What are you doing? You asked for it! Scoundrels! What did you do? You didn't understand a thing. I did it to save you! If you'd followed my order, only I would have died. One colonel more or one colonel less makes no difference. In Rome there are many colonels! So what have you done now? They'll shoot all of us! Are you happy? Here we are! Company, attention! Forward! This time I'll command the firing squad. Major! Only one bullet is enough for me. Two for them, because they are idiots! Silence! Major! I'd warned you not to give this order. The village is in our hands. You're surrounded by English troops. This time you got a big fright, huh? How can I thank you? You've saved my life twice. No, no. I only did my duty. It's a military operation. - I just happened to save you. - No, no, no! You're saying this because you don’t' want to admit being fond of your enemy. - We are no longer enemies. - I know. We respect each other. Those scoundrels who wanted to kill me, are my allies. The Germans are no longer your allies. - No? I don't understand. - He doesn't understand. Today, September 8, Marshal Badoglio signed the armistice with the English, French, Americans. - So the war is over? - The war is over! Together we'll fight a war against those pigs, as you call them! Sergeant Major Quaglia, did you hear? Order the men to take up arms again. - Colonel Di Maggio. - Here I am! Colonel, you know what? At your side, I'll gladly fight. I'm glad to fight with you, too. - I know you care so much about it. - Thank you. What? I kept it as a relic, and you throw it like that? I promised that if I'd arrive in time to save you, I wouldn't have smoked a pipe anymore. And then you say you happened to save my life! We can't waste time now. You and I must unite forces and take over the entire area before the Germans do. Okay! We will conquer it! Bravo! You have learned the sign of victory. I wanted to ask you. Before beginning to march, may I... After a half hour in front of the firing squad, anyone in my place, in my shoes... Is it urgent? Please. - Sergeant Major Quaglia! - Yes, Colonel? - Do you know where... - Yes. At the end on the left. Thank you.
