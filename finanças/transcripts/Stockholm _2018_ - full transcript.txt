We're live. Alright everybody. This is Chief Mattsson. - Get down, get down. - Coming out. You better not be armed! No, no, no, not armed. What's your name? You can call me the Outlaw, huh? Remember the Alamo. Woo! You alright, Vinter? What happened? Oh, oh, you worried about the cop? Ah, how 'bout that you guys, huh? First thing he wants to know is how the cop is! Don't worry about him! Get outta here, huh, we're done with you now. Get outta here, huh, go on beat it. Beat it, you heard me. Oh, God, we're done with you. Get to the hospital. I'm not leaving. Hey, you guys having a drink or what? You wanna talk to him or me? I would like to talk with Ms. Lind. She here? Yeah, she's fine, stand up, stand up. Is that you? Where are the others? I'm doing the talking. Alright? Bring me Gunnar Sorensson. Now. Gunnar Sorensson? That's right. From Kalmar Prison. We can't do that. Let me tell you, What you can and cannot do, alright? Listen to me, just walk, just walk. Alright. Nice and easy, get down, real easy, I mean easy. Bring me Gunnar Sorennsson by 3 p.m., or I'm gonna shoot her in the head, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy, you don't want to do that. You don't want to hurt her. Now you've come to a bank. You want money? That's right, money. Right, I want one million. US dollars un-marked. You hear me? American? That'll take some time to... And I want two pistols, and a getaway car and bulletproof vests, for, for the hostages, too. That's a little one sided. And who is this hostage, just you, cowboy? Me and Gunnar, you get it? We will let the ladies go when it's over. When we're free. I'll talk with the Ministry. Give us a few hours. I thought I was talking to somebody with some authority? I thought I was talking to a bank robber? Better not see any cops on this floor. Huh? I'm gonna be upstairs. You alright? C'mon. Bring those mics please. Only if you have a clear shot, right? Yes, I understand. Everybody behind the line. Step back, everybody. How do you know Gunnar Sorensson? Oh, everybody knows Gunnar Sorensson. He's the greatest bank robber in the whole world. Didn't he kill someone? Listen, it's a couple hour drive from Kalmar, hmm? I brought us a cribbage board, some cards. I don't have any red pegs, but I have some matchsticks that we can use. Alright? Do you play cribbage? I have to pee. I don't wanna die. Let me take her to a restroom. Do I look like an idiot? Have some decency. Okay, I mean one of you can go at a time, but if you don't come back, I'll shoot the other one. C'mon, Klara, you go. You go, if you have to. I do, but you go on. No, I don't trust myself. Alright, then, then I'll go first. Will you untie my hands? Now listen. I just wanna make sure you come back, okay? She's not as strong as you. Come back now, ya hear? Oh. Did you think about leaving me? Okay, come with me. - It's him, it's him. - Mr. Sorensson? Mr. Sorensson, why have you been released? Mr. Sorensson, who is in the bank? There is nothing to say. Keep moving. - Keep moving. - Give a statement! Why are you here, Mr. Sorensson? Is that mine? Ok. You went? I'm coming out with Gunnar Sorensson! He's agreed to help us. Negotiate. Yes, yes, yes. You know this guy? I'm not sure yet. Let us have one hostage for Gunnar, huh? You keep forgetting that I am the one making the demands. I see Gunnar, I don't see my car, huh? Is it you? Next time I see you, I want you to be puttin' keys to a Mustang 302 like Steve McQueen had in Bullitt, understood? Oh, yeah. I like that movie. Yeah. I did it! Yeah! You're free, hah! We're set, I've got a boat for us we sail tonight. You crazy bastard, Kreditbank? Yeah, like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Wait, wait, wait are you on something? Yeah, why, you want some? We are surrounded by every cop in the capital. You should have told me you were doing this. Yeah, I want to surprise you. What'd they offer you? Huh, what do you mean? What do they want you to kill me? I'd never do that. Yeah, I know you'd never do that, but what'd the offer you? A little money? Nothing. Nothing, nothing No. C'mon. I'm a mediator. Oh, a mediator. Yeah. That sounds important. Hey, meet the girls, huh? Hey, girls, I want you to meet my best friend, Gunnar Sorensson. Bum-ba-da-bum-bum-ba. Oh, sorry, this is Bianca. Bianca, Gunnar. And um? Klara. Klara. Gunnar, Klara. Hi. And... one government-issue pistol. Look at all this stuff. Why did you bring all this? Yeah, well, in case we get delayed. You know, who knows what we're gonna need, right? It's good, right? What? You didn't disable the cameras? No, I, I didn't think... You think I should of? I just thought, you know, we're not gonna be here very long, you know? Where is the tape room? Down that hall. By the deposit vault. I'll check it out. Alright, well... it's, I just don't think it's that big of deal, you know, I mean. Where are you going? No, yeah, right, right. You stay with the girls. Yeah, yeah, I know, of course, of course. I just... Somebody there? Hey. Look what I found. Who's he? He was hiding. Who are you, huh? I'm Elov. You know him? No. No. What do you do, huh? You a cop? No. I'm not. I've worked on a cruise ship. A cruise ship? What to America? Yes. Oh, right on. Sometimes, yes. What were you doing in the supply room? I beg you, please, just let me go. - Well he's not a cop. - No. I'll tell you that. I say we let him go. Uhm. We could use another, um, another body, ya know? Kaj Hansson. Escaped from prison seven months ago, and now he robs a bank in order to spring his old bank robber pal, Gunnar Sorensson. Chief, a man in the back hall is demanding to speak with you. Well, who is it? Mrs. Lind's husband is here. Come over, and let, let you talk to him. Don't let them boss you around. Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa! What do we get, huh? Yeah, we're hungry! Yeah, we could starve to death in here waitin' for this Mustang! It's coming, and and we will bring you food. And beer. Yeah, food, beer, cigarettes, Marlboro Reds. Yeah, yeah, slowly. Bianca, are you okay? Are you okay? I'm okay. What are you doing here? Why are you not with the kids? Well, I had to come. I, I mean. Go home. And make them dinner. And don't tell them about this. Okay, I won't. When will you be home? She'll be home tonight if, ah, beanpole over here can keep his promises, 'kay? Yeah, listen. Whoa. Let me take her spot. Ooh. Woohoohoohooooh. Sounding off like he's got a pair, huh? I like that, I like that. But no. How about that, Gunnar? Why don't you come over here and help us out? You heard him. He says no. I said no. Okay? In case you haven't noticed, your wife's a fox. Hey. And you're not, huh? C'mon. No, wait, wait, please. It won't be long, okay. Write this down. Please, write it down. Okay, give me a pen, c'mon. I don't have one. Jakobsson. Okay, I got it. You take the herring out of the fridge. I already deboned it, so you don't have to worry about bones for Martin and Mia when they eat. Why are you saying this? Because the fish, so you can cook the fish. Okay, write this down. You take a, a tablespoon of flour onto a plate, and add some salt and pepper, and then you put the fish in. In the plate? On the plate, and then you turn it over. Okay. And you put a spoon on butter into the pan, and heat it up until it gets brown. When the butter gets brown? The butter gets brown. And then you put the fish in, and you fry it for, um, four or five minutes. Not more. On each side because Mia doesn't like when it's burned. I know. 'Cause she won't eat it. So, so that's important. Four or five minutes. And then, ah, the potatoes I boiled last night. So you don't need to do anything, you just take Bianca, Bianca, I don't know, I, I. I love you. I love you, too. And the lingonberries jam is in the jar your mom gave us. The green jar. It's in the side, in the door of the fridge. Um, if I die, you can, you can live on fish. You won't die. She won't die! She won't right? Please don't tell them. Yes, she won't die as long as he gives me what I need, alright? I need a Mustang! Please don't tell them. Please don't tell Mia. I need unmarked bills! I need food, I need cigarettes! You're not helpin' me at all, Jack! It's all on its way, Kaj. Or, excuse me, would you prefer Mr. Hansson? We know it's you. Call me whatever you want, okay? Hmm, good. And you cannot leave with these hostages. Ah, yes, we will be taking the hostages out of here. No, you can't. It's Prime Minister's orders. The car's a death trap without them. The car is coming. You're free to go on your own. You might have to kill one of them so we can get out of here. Some people, quite properly appalled at the abuses that occurred, will say that Watergate demonstrates the bankruptcy of the American political system. Excuse me, Olof? Not now, please. I just received a call from Kaj Hansson at Kreditbank. He says he'll kill the hostages, sir. This whole thing is absurd. Hello? Hello, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. Hansson. Your Chief of Police says that you won't let us leave with the hostages. That's quite right. So then you want to be responsible for the deaths of innocent citizens? No, of course not. Well, then, let us leave with them. That is simply impossible. Olof, I am gonna count to 10, and if you don't agree to let us leave with the hostages, then I'm going to kill. Klara, yeah. So, beginning now. Ten! Nine! Eight! No, no, no! Stop that! Do you agree? Seven! Stop it. Stop it! Sorry. Let go of me! Don't touch me again! Six! Five! - Four! - Now you listen to me, Mr. Hansson. Please stop you don't - wanna do this. - Hey! Back off! Alright? Do you agree? Three! You stop that! Now! - Two, one, do you agree? - No! Listen to me. Mr. Hansson! No! You have 'til tomorrow to change you mind or one of them dies. Fuuuuuck! Fuck! You, you coward. Ah! You shut your mouth. I thought they'd cooperate. You know, I thought they'd cooperate. I didn't think the Prime Minister of Sweden doesn't give a shit if they live or die. I mean, what's that say about us? You know what they told me? That you kill a hostage, they get you a plane out of here. How crazy is that, man? - No, no, no pills, no. - No, I got to. - No, you need the sleep. - Yeah, I can't, I can't I can't go to sleep. This is wide open. I don't trust the cops. We can't sleep. There's a vault in the back there. We can sleep in there. I can't take this anymore. Don't worry. - I want go home. - It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Bianca? You got a key to the vault? Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Get in, in, in. Gunnar Sorensson is here to help us broker a peaceful resolution. And the hostages? Can you confirm their identities? Yes, Elov Erikkson, Bianca Lind and Klara Mardh. Has Mr. Hansson harmed any of them? Actually, we spoke half an hour ago with a gentleman hiding out in Hawaii who claims to be the real Kaj Hansson. And what did he say? He said he's gonna sue all of us for spreading libelous rumors. Said he would never take hostages. So if the robber's not Kaj Hansson, who is it? Well, we are working on that. And the girls, have, have they been harmed? Yes, and we fear he may rape them. Bullshit! Turn that off. Goddamn! Why would they say that? Cops lie to get what they want. Do I look like a rapist? Jeez, if I knew we were going to be spending all night in here, I would have brought your 12-string. This guy can play, okay? In Kalmar, Gunnar played beautifully, all night long. Remember, ah, Helsingborg? At the fair. - We used to sing. - Hmm. No, thank you. We used to knock this Dylan song out of the park. Remember that? - Tomorrow is a long time. - Ah, yeah. Nice one. Bring the canisters in here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just, I wanted to listen to music. I, I didn't know until I, I like music, I like when you were singing before. I had one of them when I was 19. So, um, so you're from Helsinborg? Born there. Grew up in the states. - Yeah, yeah, the accent, I. - Mmhmm. I remember, I ah, I saw a photo in Helsinborg paper maybe, five, six years ago. That was you, right? You broke into elderly couple's house. And the old man's heart started acting up. His wife asked you to get his heart medicine, and you did and you saved his life. Wasn't me. When we get out of here, they're gonna put a transmitter under the car, right? They're gonna track us. But if Gunnar and I could slip out of the car, near the cove, and somebody else drove it up the E4. Just for a couple hours. That'd give us enough time to sail across the Baltic. You think you could do that for me? What, me? Yeah. You don't know how to drive? Yes, yes, I do. Then you could do it. No. Where are you going, what's...? I'm gonna go to France. And take the money. Gonna get a plastic surgeon. Start over, you know? I remember, um, the Helsinborg's robber had a, a wife. And a kid. It was an ex-wife. And a son. What was the name of the Helsinborg robber? That little priss's name was Lars, okay? But that's not me. That's not who I am. I have a daughter. And a son. I'd like to see them again, Lars. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. Were you sleeping? No, no, of course not. Where are you? Have you been freed? No, I'm, I'm still at the bank. Wha, what, what does that mean? I, I don't have much time. I just, um... I, I miss Mia and Martin so much. I just wanna hear their voices, I... I can't really think about anything else. What about me? Tcha. I'm kidding. I just got Mia down. Can you, can you wake her up? She really needs to sleep, Bianca. I know, but... You didn't tell her, did you? You did. It's all over the news. She would have found out. Christopher, I told you, I, I asked you not to. I'm not as strong as you. I'm, can you please just worry about getting yourself out of there. Of course, yes. I'll, I'll try harder tomorrow. I didn't mean it like that, I'm... Is he listening? No. No, he's not listening. He's, he let me call. He didn't have to. He's not all bad. What are you saying? Uh, uh, I just mean, nobody's all bad. No, but that man is an animal. Bianca? Yes? How, um, how did the fish turn out? I took a meatloaf out of the freezer. It was easier. Right. Well, I have to, um... Be careful. Yeah, good night. How was the fish? They had meatloaf. Bianca, Bianca. What's going on? Huh? What are you two, what are you two up to, huh? It's my period. What's going on? Uh. I need tampons. She, she got her period. She need tampons. What? Where are we supposed to get tampons? Wha... don't you have any? It's way too early. It's not supposed to come yet. It's the trauma. Her body is stressed. Huh. Okay, yeah, I see, okay. Ask the cops. Yeah, I'll get the, I'll, I'll get the cops. Thank you. Hey! Emergency! Emergency! It's Klara! Shit! Easy, easy. Easy. What happened? It's Klara, she's bleeding man. You know, we know you're not Kaj. Who are you? Don't worry about that right now, okay, Kojak? Alright, we got bigger problems. Alright, she's, she's. What did you do to her? I didn't do anything, man, it's her time. It's, it's, you know, c'mon. She, she, I need some, tampons, okay? Look, we need to check the health of all of the hostages. You don't need anything, okay? Except to get Klara some tampons, okay? And if you get them, I will bring everybody out here, and you can give 'em a clean bill of health. Alright? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Thank you. We were supposed to be covering the Crayfish Festival today, but as you can see, media has arrived here and in the square from all over Europe. The police are desperate here in Central Stockholm. Authorities have received over 200 calls from citizens offering suggestions to end this crisis. Mrs. Lind, ah, how are you feeling? Not so good. I like to go home. Don't worry, sweetheart. We're taking care of everything. Is that so? You think we should trust you and your partner? My dear, dear girl. You are not thinking straight. Hey, don't patronize her. Okay, we've had enough of that. All of us. Don't listen to him. You see, everybody's fine. Alright, we just need the tampons. We need the bag that hopefully has the vests in it, and you have to convince the Prime Minister to let us leave today or somebody dies. I'm trying. Okay, c'mon. Go get us some breakfast now, it's taken so long. Alright? Our deal is expiring soon. You shut up about the deal. Do you see how cozy they are? The way they speak to us. Yeah. Pick it up. - Me? - Yeah. Pick it up. Hello? I am Vincent Oberg with the Swedish Television outside the Kreditbank. Who's this? Uh, this is Bianca Lind. Who is it? It's a journalist. Mrs. Lind, Vincent Oberg, Swedish Television. Yeah, you just said that. All of Sweden would like to know, what is it like being stuck in there with those criminals? It's not too bad. We want to leave with them. With the robbers? That's correct. But why, I, I don't understand? 'Cause we want to live. Sure, but, but you trust them? More than we trust our police. Ah, why haven't you left then? Because our own Prime Minister refuses to let us go. He doesn't seem to care. You think this is political? Could you connect me to Vincent Oberg, thank you. Everything is political. But surely the Prime Minister cares about your life. The Prime Minister's on line two. I'll patch him into the switchboard. Hang up, that's it. That's all I have to say. Hold on, Miss Lind? Hold on. I have the Prime Minister on the line. Sir, you're live with Miss Lind. You hear this? Hello? Hello? Mrs. Lind, I've been listening. It's not that simple. Mr. Prime Minister, it is. If you let us go, we might live. If the police don't interfere, nobody will get hurt and we will survive. You can save our lives. And the best way to do that, is not to let 'em out on the roads with you. But we are willing to take that risk. I wish that would make a difference, but as Prime Minister, I'm responsible for all the Swedish people. Exactly. But all the Swedish people are not in here, we are trapped in here. We. And, and if the police comes in, and they start shooting, he will shoot back, and then nobody will survive. We live in an orderly society. We should not be able to violent methods to do such things. He's not violent. And this is not the time to talk about this society. I am violent, hey? Did you hear what I said last night? - Now you listen to me. - Okay, If I'm not allowed to leave here right now, one of these hostages is going to die. Please, stop it. Alright, and if it's Mrs. Lind, I hope you have the guts to walk over to her house, and look her small son and her small daughter in the eyes and say that you did the right thing. I got an idea, come here, mmhmm. - What? - I've got an idea. Give me your pistol, I need the pistol. Why? Give it me, here, hey, let her go, alright? Go. Where are you taking her, man? Where are you going? Okay, okay. You wanna see your kids again, right? Yes, of course. Right, okay. I got to kill someone, right? I mean, I've got to and I, I think it should be you. What? You know, I, they will never let any of us out of here alive if they don't believe that I killed somebody. Okay? So, think? So you wanna, you wanna shoot me? Yeah, I, I wanna put this vest on you. Okay, you understand? I'm gonna go out there by the stairs with you. I'm gonna, I'm gonna pretend to negotiate. We'll have a given signal, okay? You try to run, I shoot, up close at an angle, alright? It'll hurt. It'll hurt a lot, but you won't die. Have you done this before? Gunnar has. He did it a few years ago. Now listen, if you're too scared, I'm just gonna make Elov do it. I am not too scared. It's just, you are so much more valuable than he is. You're a woman, you're a mother. You're extremely valuable. Alright, the only part I don't like, is then we're gonna have to leave without you, alright? I'll take Klara, I'll take Elov. We'll get in the car, we'll go. The cops will come in, they'll find you, and they'll just take you straight home to your children. So, you and the others will survive, and I can go home? Do you belong to the Swedish Church? Yeah. I do. Dear God who holds his children dear. Look to me, as little as I am. My fate is in your hands. Bianca. Yes? Bianca, that'll be our signal. I'll say your name. And then you'll run, and I'll fire. Okay? Hey! Pigs! C'mon out! Alright, alright. Listen to me. I'm done. Okay, I'm done. One of two things is gonna happen right now. You're gonna get me my car and my unmarked bills, and I'm gonna drive outta here, or I am gonna kill this woman. - You understand? - Oh, relax, you're not going to shoot anyone. Oh, really? We know who you are. Now. You are the Helsignborg robber, Lars Nystrom. Ah, you're a big softie. Maybe even a bit of a queer. I'm not queer, asshole! It makes sense with the, - the long hair. - Shut up! Shut up! - Yeah, Bianca can feel it. - Shut up, no! Bianca, look at me. You don't talk to Bianca! I talk to Bianca! Bianca, look over here. No! No! Ah! Oh. Shit! - What's going on? - Shut up. Lars? Oh, Oooooh! Fuck! Oh! Shit. Vinter, how could I be so bloody wrong? Gunnar! - Sit, sit. - Gunnar! - Oh, shit. - Oh, my God. Oh, shit. What happened? Oh, shit. Huh? What happened, man? She tried to escape, okay? She tried to escape and I... I shot her, I, I, I... You shot her? Accidentally, I, I... You're insane. You come in here, - and you, you killed. - Shut up! - An unarmed woman! - Get back, back! Sit down! Oh, fuck. Ten minutes ago, we heard more gunfire inside the Kreditbank. Chief Mattsson has confirmed that one of the hostages, Miss Bianca Lind, has been killed by Lars Nystrom. Did her bizarre trust in him lead to her death? And why are authorities loading tear gas into the bank? They are growing desperate to end this ordeal, but they must now await Prime Minister Palme's approval to let Nystrom leave with the remaining hostages. I'm Vincent Oberg, live from Central Stockholm. They're buying for time. They're gonna drill a hole through the ceiling, and then they're gonna give us the tear gas. No, don't worry, there's solid concrete up there. Did I ever tell you about my buddy, Pete? Pete Noonan? Who? My Vietnam Navy buddy? Got exposed to that gas, 90 seconds, scrambled his brain. I mean, he's a babbling idiot now. Yep. What is that? You hear that? Yeah, I hear it. What is it? I don't know. Get in here, get in here. Both of you. What is it? You see anything? A microphone. A microphone? Let me see. What do you mean? Outside. Come here, come. Wait in here. You're alive. Oh, my God. I thought you were dead. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come here, come here. Let me see you. Oh, God, oh. It just went black when I hit the floor. Shh. They slipped a microphone in here, they're listening. We have to be quiet. They think we don't know. So now, we talk for the microphone, try to get everyone out. When he gets here, we'll figure out what to say. We need to speak loudly. What the fuck? Shit. What's going on? Well, it's the same thing you did, man. Same thing. Careful, careful, careful. Careful, careful, careful. Sorry, sorry. Careful. Careful, careful, ya. I don't understand. I pulled the same stunt that you did. At, at the Goteberg robbery? What? When you shot Joelle, and he had the vest on and you fooled everybody. What are you talking about? She's got a vest on. What, I, I taught you that? Yeah. You believed that story? That didn't happen? Of course not. I mean, nice play, Lars, it's risky, but it's fucking crazy, man. I mean, how, how could you not know she wasn't dead? Well, I, I was, I don't know. It's just a little bruise. I got scared, man. You got scared? Listen, here's the plan, okay? There's a microphone. We can go in there, we can say whatever we want, but they have to believe that Bianca is dead. Tch. I need ice and painkillers. Ice and pain killers? You jerk. Chief? Hmm? They're back in the vault. Ice and painkillers help at this time of the month. I'm, I'm really hungry. Quit your bitchin' or I'll kill you too. Yeah, yeah, Mattsson here. Chief Mattsson, now you've got one dead hostage, you want another? Are you gonna let us drive out of here? I have the authority Now put Gunnar on the line. I'm not gonna put Gunnar on the line. You can talk to me, I'm in charge. This is Gunnar. How are the others? The others? Klara's scared. She's got cramps. We can send down a doctor. We don't need a doctor. We need ice and painkillers. And food. And food. And cigarettes. I have cigarettes. Want one? You're not allowed to smoke in the vault. Well, Klara, this is my vault now. And we smoke, if I say we smoke. 'Cause I'm in charge. Now, the only food we have is one pear. And no, you can't have any, so don't even ask. You want some food? You ask the cops. Start beggin' the cops. No, and you don't get any. Yum, yum, yum. Boy, this pear is delicious. - Huh, Gunnar? - Something's wrong. Thank you. Ah, it's better that he underestimates me. I don't know. That's how it starts. Yeah. Steve McQueen works at this machine shop. When he gets out of jail, he robs a bank. That's such a good movie. I saw it three times. Have you seen it? You look like Ali MacGraw. They, they let you watch movies in prison? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they let you see prostitutes in prison. Yeah, well, if you get the conjugal room. They give you a couch. What do you have to pay them? That's pretty much how prostitution works. Well, I know that. I was just saying, you know? - Fuck, why wouldn't you call man? - I bring you supplies. What is your problem? What if I freaked out? - Just relax, Lars. - Huh? You know how I found out who you are? I don't give a shit, man. Bianca told us. Before you killed her. She was just pretending to like you. Trying to survive. You know that, right? Screw you, man. Screw you. Oh, little touchy about her, are we? Sorensson, we need to chat. Why? A mediator talks to both sides. I was hoping he'd sell you out by now. He's been lying to you Lars. You trying to mess with his head? Well, someone has to. What happened to our arrangement? Look, I, I didn't know it was Lars, then. Oh, don't tell me he's your best friend. You're the only one you care about. End this before dark, or you will have the same sentence as Lars. Now, what's up, hey, what's going on? - We cool? - Yeah. Yeah. Are you two alright? No, we're still starving and tired. You just let us leave with him. They need to wear those vests. You have all of them? I see. Hey, look, you wanna be concerned, get us keys to the Mustang. Oh, yeah. No, no no, whoa, whoa, whoa! C'mon, man. We don't need you in here, back up and toss 'em. Huh, just toss them. Hey! Open the door! Jesus. Did you know he was gonna do that? No! Did you know he was gonna do that? You know, you are crazy, man. Were you in on this? No, you heard what I said. Fuck! Everyone to the vault. You alright, you okay? I need, I need the painkillers. Klara needs her painkillers. There's, there's no painkillers. There's no food, it's just ice. Go to the vault. Move, move, move, move. Cover the vault! Hold your positions. Await my orders. They're in position. Do not lower your weapons! The crisis here has grown stranger still. Almost like an American movie. The police are threatening force and the International Media are baffled by the irrational behavior of the hostages. Psychiatrists are now advising the police that the hostages may be brainwashed. Everybody open your mouths. Hands over your ears. Here we go. Jesus, what was that? Are the others gone? We've lost the audio, yeah? Is that it? Yeah. Okay, he blew up the fucking mic. Let's get a camera down there. Okay, we'll use the same setup. No, no, no, not until we penetrate the ceiling. - We can use the same... - Increase the drilling for the next three hours, nonstop! Okay, Ingemar... And then turn up the heat. Yes, but... To suffocate them. Listen to what I'm saying. And then we freeze them. Ingemar? And then back again, on, off, on, off, on, off, on, Hang on, Ingemar, they're going to get sick, okay? Of, on and off. What's gotten into you? No. It's the hostages I'm thinking of. Yeah, the hostages. They have not eaten or drank... If the hostages want our help they need to show us some respect. All I am say... Oh, they... you look what they're doing. Those criminals that think they're in charge. But we are in charge. So let's turn up the heat, and when they call us, they will, you do not answer the phones, you hear me? Do you hear me? I do Chief. Then get to it. Okay, you heard him, okay? The heat goes up, yeah, go. This was a bad idea. What was? All of it. Everything. How can you say that? How could you say that? They're about to gas us to death, alright? And you're taking their side? If I was on their side. If I was on their side, you would be dead by now. Shit. I'm not gonna let you gas us to death! No, Lars! No, no! Cover the bloody hole! Get the medic! A medic! No gas! No gas! No! Lars. No! Use your head. You kill a cop, we're all dead. You killed a cop. I did not. Yes, you did. That was my idiot partner. - Oh, my God! - I'm not so stupid! You were there, you got accessory! I did not pull the trigger. Not dead, anyway. Oh, yeah? Is that it? Huh? Put it down. You put it down. Put it down. - You put it down. - Please, stop this. Please, listen to me. Please. Please, stop. C'mon, Gunnar. Oh, that's the way it is, huh? So either I bust you out, or you turn me in, or you kill me, huh? It's a win win for you, is that it, huh? I've been giving you second chances all your life, Lars. I know, that is what brothers do for each other, man! That is what having each other's back means! Look, you don't wanna leave me with me, I don't wanna go. Turn me in. Turn me in, I don't care. What are they offering you, huh? A lot. Yeah, how much am I worth, huh? I just said, a lot. Huh, c'mon, put the gun down. Let's fight. What? C'mon, man, let's fight! C'mon, like old times, c'mon! Put the gun down and let's fight, and then you can turn me in, and I won't even tell everybody how you've turned into a little bitch cop who stabbed me in the back. Oh, my God. He's like a child! Oh! Stop! Stop! It's enough, stop! Off me! It's enough. It's enough. It's okay. Do it. Pull the trigger. I don't wanna see you killed. Please? Just do it. Look who's got both guns now. Oh. Gee... Let's just all relax now. Yeah? Alright. We good? Oh, we're great, Lars, yeah. Alright, let's get some rest. Gotta be alert on those roads. I'm very sorry, Frederick. Let me see. It's gonna be okay. You were... you were unbelievably brave, you know? Really. I've never seen anything like it. It's incredible. Yeah, I was very brave. Lars? Can I call home? You can't, no. I mean, you can't. My... my daughter probably thinks I'm dead and, and my parents, I. I can't even imagine what they're going through. They just have to right now. For a little bit longer. It's the only way we're gonna get out of here. It's the only thing that makes it worth it. Yeah. Okay. My father wishes I died a long time ago, you know, so. No. Yeah, no, you're better off... Yeah. I mean, look, I mean, I don't want it to sound like that. Like I, I hate it when, you know, professionals act like it's all their parents fault, you know? I mean, I, I deserved every sentence I've ever gotten. And then some. You were not afraid of prison? No, it's just once you start making money the easy way, you can't go back. And then I stabbed somebody. What? I did, I, um, there was this kiddiefiddler. Like a real creep, like. Gunnar and I knew it for a fact. He lived down the hall from us and we, we found out, and I took a butter knife and I stabbed him. And Gunnar was with you, you, you were living with Gunnar? Yeah, uhhuh, uhhuh. And then we were cellmates. You really love him, don't you? He's like my brother. Hmm. You know, he was, he was really a, you know, he was really strong, you know? He taught me everything. Ya know? I don't know, Lars. We're going to send in tear gas. You have one minute to give up. Place your weapons into the bag, slide it under the hole so we can see them. One minute or we start the gas. No, no, no, no, no! What do you mean, you said you were gonna... One minute! It's not the phone. You have to press the red button. - Hey, what's going on? - Hey? Hey, you said you were gonna let us go? Things have changed. - What do you mean? What? - Lars? We should do what he says. Fuck no! No way, man! You, you, you said we could go! One minute! How can they do that, they can't gas us all! I know they wanna kill me, but for what? - Toss the guns in the bag. - No way! - The guns in the bag! - Fuck you! No! No retreat, man! Why would they wanna kill all of us? What you doing with that? Put that down. Hey, don't touch her! Do not fucking touch her! Calm down! Calm down! I will blow your head off! Are you okay? I have an idea. We're sending in the gas Lars. Yeah, no, that's great, you just a, you pump the gas in, and then, ah, Elov and Klara will die, no problem. They will be just fine. No, no, no, they, they won't be fine. They have nooses around their necks, so when you put the gas in, they'll pass out, and then they'll be strangled to death, and it'll be your fault. What nooses? I don't believe you. The nooses I put around their necks. Uh... let me see. Hold on a minute. Set up the CCTV camera, bring it over here. We're gonna place it inside the hole to take a look. We're sending down a camera through the hole. Now stay away, and don't do any bloody shooting. Oh, shit, get down, get down, get down. On the ground like you're dead, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Get down. Oh, Jesus Christ. Now you let them free. All you have to do is give me what I want, and let me leave with my hostages and all this will be over. Let them out of those nooses! Understood? Chief? You go down there. What you mean me? I can go. No! I need you here. You go down and you let them out. Just go on, I, I've lost all, bloody... Go on. Okay, we're gonna open the door and let them go, hang tight. Fuck! I mean, I'm sorry, I'm coming down. Do it, do it, do it, do it, open the door! Open the door! Jesus Christ, I really fucked it up. I'm going to open the door now. - Alright, back up, back up, back up! - Okay, easy. Back up.Easy. Why are you here? Where's Mattsson? He sent me. Your car's ready. And he says that your deal is over, Sorensson. You're in this all the way now. Huh. Keep your eye on the front door. See if you can take him. Stand back everybody. Everybody behind the line. I can't wait to take a shower. I'm quitting this job. So what's gonna happen to us, man? Let's just get to France, and then we'll see what happens. Most likely you go your way, I go mine, right? I think so, yes. You gonna give me the gun? Why, you gonna help me? It's up to you. Klara, come with me. - Okay? - Yeah. Why did he leave that radio behind? What do you mean? Well, it's for her. Yeah, he's a tender brute, that Lars. Ibsen? Send in some gas. Just enough to bring someone back from the dead. Yes, Chief. There's no harm if she really is dead. Is it? The money is in the trunk. Just keep your eyes on her. Get in the middle, get in, get in get in, get in, get in. Go in back. Back off, easy, easy. Listen to me. Listen to me. We've cleared the traffic along the Hamngaten. You can take that to the highway. Clear the way! There's nothing, Chief. No, yeah, it was worth a try. Just turn it off. Wait, do you see that? It's the Chief. Listen very carefully. Oh, listen to that purr! Hahahaha, yes, yes! Oh, yeah! Alright, here we go! Oh, my God, oh, my God! - Oh, my God, oh, my God! - Hold your fire! Hold your fire, who did that? - I'm gonna kill her! - I'm gonna blow his - brains out right now! - It was a mistake! It was a mistake, I'm sorry! - Hold your fire! - Was that gunfire? Hey, you want me to kill him? I will blow his brains all over this car! Right on National TV! We'll replace the tires. - Calm down. - You lied to me, man. - Come out and I'll, I'll. - No! - Escort you to the lobby. - No! While they find a new tire. I'm not leaving this car. Lars, I'm not going back in there. I'm not... Look into the eyes of those men. Those volunteers, they're terrified. You're not safe out here. I don't trust them anymore. I will kill her. Let's go. Back off! Back off! Back off! Stand down, stand down! Everybody back off, or I'll blow her brains out. Hold your fire! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Hold your fire! Back up! I hate you! I hate you! Hold your fire! I don't know what happened. You'll be safer in here. This is so bad, man, this is so bad. Ah, yes, it's terrible, I don't understand what happened. I'm very sorry. You tell them to stop pointing their guns. You tell them to stop pointing their guns, man! And now we'll just wait in here until they replace that tire. And in the meantime, we should ah, get Mrs. Lind's body out of there, huh? Have you, no, do you have the, you have the key to the vault? Please? Let's go back to the vault. I'm not going back to the vault. - C'mon, man, we got to. - Please? No, you never go back. Never go back! You don't want to leave her in there. It's not right. We're going back to the vault. - Shit! - C'mon. Put your guns down. Shame on you. Alright, alright, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh, shit! I got 'em, I got 'em. Here, take this, take this, take this. - No closer. - Ah, shit. Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it! Give me that, give me that, give me that, get in! In, in, in. Get back! Stay back! Oh, you're not going in as well? Stay back. I have a confession to make, Get out. Get out, they know! Lars? Lars! Wait. I know Mrs. Lind is not inside the vault. Hey! Turn on the gas! Turn on the gas! Oh, God. Guys! No gas! Help! No gas! Oh shit, man, it's gonna go to our brains. Oh fuck, no! No! - No, turn off the gas! - I can't breathe. I don't want to die! Please? Please? I'm not going back to prison! You said we had a deal, I'm not going back to prison. I'm not going back. I'll shoot her. You hear me? No! You understand? Turn off the gas! I will kill her. Turn it off or I'll shoot her. Turn off the gas! Chief! We need to turn off the gas. Your dead, Mattsson. Turn off the gas! Turn off the gas! I'll kill her, and make sure - we do it properly this time. - Nooooo! Goddamnit, no gas! No gas, we give up! Please, help! No more gas! No more gas! Place the guns where we can see them. - Throw them in front of you. - No more gas! Gas masks everyone! Get the hostages out first. Lars and Gunnar are left alone with us in there? It was self defense, your honor. Step back from the door! Hostages first! C'mon! I said up! Stand up! You ladies first. C'mon. Let's go together. They're gonna shoot Lars. C'mon, c'mon. We're coming out. Stay behind me. You have an angle on him? Don't shoot, don't shoot. Don't be afraid, sweetheart. You're safe now. You separate them before they get to the lobby. You wanna go back to prison? Everyone got out alive. Now you owe me my freedom. Go, go, get, get, get. No! No. No! No, please, don't hurt him. Don't. All the hostages have been freed. Including Mrs. Bianca Lind who was previously thought dead. This will surely go down as one of the strangest episodes. On record, with the entire nation captivated by every twist and turn. You can see the exhaustion on their faces. A shellshocked expression on their faces. How do you feel, Mrs. Lind? Get back to work, fellas. You have a visitor, Nystrom. Who? I don't know. Bianca? Oh, wow. What are you doing here? Have you, um, heard from Gunnar? He's free, you know? He won his appeal hearing. So he's out. And I'm in. Your ah, husband is okay? Christopher, he's great. He's a good man. We're all good. What are you gonna do when you get out? Leave Sweden, I guess. Why? Hey? What is it? I don't know, I just, I can't stop thinking about what happened with us. I still have a, a scar on my back because of you. But I'm alive. I survived.
