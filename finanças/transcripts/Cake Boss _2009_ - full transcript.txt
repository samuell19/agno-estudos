BUDD Y: On this episode of "Cake Boss"... We want it to look like a real fire truck. JOEY: This is all wrong. Fire engine has water. Fire truck has ladder on it. BUDD Y: I'm thinking maybe cheetah, leopard, zebra. You know, something real sexy. How the hell did it peel off?! Listen to me! How bad is it? This is the anniversary week of my father dying. I wanted to maybe make something special for him. You got the chief in front, giving everybody orders. BUDD Y: That's right. It was so phenomenal, it hurt. This is Carlo's Bakery. ♪ Sugar ♪ Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors. ♪ Oh, sugar, sugar ♪ This is the crew. Mia famiglia. ♪ Sugar ♪ We're gonna take this bakery to the top. They call me Buddy. I'm the boss. ♪ Sugar ♪ ♪ Oh, sugar, sugar ♪ All right, guys. I got the cake of the week. Team meeting. This has got to be awesome. It's for a retired fireman. You know, it's a good thing. I had this local fireman come in. And he wanted me to make this cake for this retirement home for these fireman who are sick, who are disabled, you know, who put their lives on the line for us. We want it to look like a real fire truck. We want it to have the sirens and the lights, if possible. I don't know if you guys can do that or not. I'm gonna make the cake look so real that you're not gonna want to the touch it. You're gonna think it's on fire. How's that? [ Chuckling ] We'll see. BUDD Y: We need sirens, lights. I'm gonna chainsaw this toy up. We're gonna take the electrical components out of it. There's no textbook for this. You can't read this. You can't buy a "how to make crazy fire-truck cake" book. That's the fire truck? Not only is Joey a baker here, but he works two days a week as a fireman. JOEY: This is all wrong. We're talking about doing a cake for firefighters. And they're gonna say, "Ah, it's a great cake, but this is wrong. " The hydrants over here -- They're flowing water, and they don't even have any water going into the engine. What's the difference between a fire truck and a fire engine? Fire engine has water. Fire truck has a ladder on it. We definitely want an engine. All right, do we know what an engine looks like? M y brother-in-law Joey, I think, saw the frustration, you know, because the wheels were turning, and I just wasn't getting what I wanted. -Wish I could see it. -I'll get you a fire truck. You want a fire truck, I'll get you a fire truck. I was like, "Hey, that's not a bad idea. Call them up. " [ Siren wailing ] You want a fire truck? There's a fire truck. This is a truck. That's an engine. All right, we want to look at the engine. We want to see the engine. Let's look at the engine. We start looking. I'm like, "Frankie, photograph it. " Shoot 'em up. [ Camera shutter clicking ] JOEY: This is a steamer connection. This was the one I was talking about hooking to the hydrant. BUDD Y: So we're gonna pull up in front. JOEY: Right, you'll pull up, you hook to the hydrant. This comes in. This goes straight to the pumps. The pump panel is always on the driver's side. Now, this is where all the controls happen, you get the water out of the hoses and everything. Everyone's gonna look at this cake and dissect it. They're firemen. This is for real firemen. It's got to be for real. This is not a fire truck. This is like a fire scene. There's a fire truck with a guy holding a hose squirting water on the fire. A screaming lady like this. I'm gonna have smoke, lights, sirens. This thing is gonna be nuts. I told Christine, Tony, and Sunshine to start making all the little elements in the scenery. We use modeling chocolate for things that need to be sculpted. It's really easy to work with. You can make it any color, so it's perfect for getting all the right details. Modeling chocolate is made of chocolate and corn Syrup, so it's all edible. Project like this usually takes six, seven days. I only got three. I n the meantime, Joey's got to get moving on making this pound cake. Pound cake's definitely the right cake to use for the fire truck and the big building Buddy has planned. We use lots of butter... Swear to God, it's fat-free. ... sugar... ... and Buddy's secret ingredient, cream cheese, which gives it great texture and makes it perfect for carving. BUDD Y: Joey's got the pound cake baking, but I got to get moving on something else -- this fashionista cake. This cake is for two girls who are turning 30. WOMAN: They're really into fashion. Anything involving shoes, designer ready-to-wear, they're all about it. So we wanted to surprise them with a cake. BUDD Y: You go from lights, sirens, smoke to, you know, pocketbook, shoes -- Big transition. I got to get in touch with my feminine side to make this cake. Let's get the shoebox out first, roll it out for the bottom. I got to make this fashionista cake for these girls who really know high fashion. You know, there's no room for error. The fashionista cake is basically four separate elements. You have a shoebox, shopping bag. You have a shoe. You have a pocketbook. All those things are made of cake. Then we cover them with fondant, which is, like, a sugar dough. I have this thing called "quilting" that I used on the pocketbook. It kind of looked real, real sexy. So I took this quilting tool and I made these lines, and I did this quilting pattern to it. I mean, makes the cake look awesome. We started painting the whole pocketbook. And then I had to start putting these pieces together. I'm so happy to see everybody! I'm back! -MAN: Hello. -[ Laughs ] Everybody on line to kiss Mama. How much youse miss me? BUDD Y: That's my mama. Mama always just tries to bring joy and energy and happiness to the bakery. She tries to make the peace between my sisters and everybody else. And then there's my son. BUDD Y: We have a special bond, me and my mom. M y Buddy. Very good. This is the anniversary week of my father dying 15 years ago. I mean, I thought, being that we always have dinner out, I wanted to maybe make something special. You know what? A cream-puff cake. Oh, that was his signature cake! Oh, you're right. I can't believe I didn't think of that. The signature cake. People really love that. I wanted him to make a special cake for us to have for the dessert. And the cream-puff cake was the one cake that Buddy Sr., he created that. It's 15 years. I know. 15 years. You're so much like him. BUDD Y: M y mom wants me to do this cream-puff cake. It's for my dad. How can I let him down? MAMA: Absolutely. BUDD Y: Let's put this inside, Remy. I got to get started on this fire-truck cake. We're gonna put this fogging machine underneath the cake. And I can make the smoke come out of different parts of the roof. It's not really smoke. It's water vapor. It's not gonna harm the cake. Next, we layer and stack the pound cake in the the shape of the building. And we started to dirty-ice it. That's buttercream icing in there. What we got to do with that is just got to get it all perfectly smooth so that, when we put the walls on, they stick. The walls are basically fondant. We took this little brick-impression thing on all these sheets of fondant. And I used a board to kind of like guide it up. 'Cause if I would have picked up that fondant and just put it on, it would have cracked. I want to cut it now. We get the whole front and back covered. I got the girls cutting windows. Then I start going to the roof. So my roof trick is taking black fondant, sticking it in poppy seeds. It's the best roof you could ever build. And then in the back of my head, I'm like, "Uh-oh. The fashionista cake. " All right, Sunshine. We got that shoe. I'm thinking maybe cheetah, leopard, zebra. You know, something real sexy. STEPHAN I E: Buddy asked me to make a high-fashion shoe, so I'm making a zebra shoe. If I can do my job right, the girls are gonna think that the elements that I put on this cake came out of their closet. And it's all edible. STEPHAN I E: This is all gum paste, which is very similar to fondant. This is completely edible. BUDD Y: This tissue paper -- This is basically made... This is the fondant, and we roll it out real thin on the machine there. The hardest thing part of making a fashionista cake is the coloring. Like, the colors all got to complement each other, blend, and still pop at the same time. I look at the cake, and I'm like, "Hey, this is beautiful. I am an artiste. I'm a fashionista. Mwah!" STEPHAN I E: Very sexy. BUDD Y: I just finished this fashionista cake. Last delivery. End of the day. I'm trying to wrap things up. Where's Stretch? -Come on, Stretch. -Let's go! BUDD Y: Last delivery, baby. This is it. Nice and easy. Don't drop nothing. Don't mess nothing up. -I'll be careful. -All right? That's Stretch. What can I say? I don't know why I keep him around. I guess, you know, I got a soft spot in my heart for him. On time. The cake's got to be put in the right place. -Or you'll be in trouble. -Okay. At Carlo's right now, I'm the delivery boy. They tell me I'm bad at everything, but they keep me around. I've been there like a year and a half now. [ Laughs ] It's not really a hard job. I mean, I just have to drive and deliver cakes. [ Thud ] Then sometimes you hear weird sounds come out of the car. And that's when the job gets hard. Oh, man. The cake seems to have fallen apart. I'm gonna call up Buddy now. Oh, man. Hello. Hey, um, the fondant was still too soft. It just completely peeled off. -What? -It peeled off. How the hell did it peel off?! You had to hit the brakes! Listen to me! How bad is it? He can't even drive around the friggin' corner without screwing up a cake! You had to hit the brakes! How bad is it? We're making progress on this fire-truck cake. Everybody's got to stop. It's all off now. Now we got to stop what we're doing, go fix his friggin' mistake. -Give me an assessment! -Okay, it's not bad at all. You need to roll out one more piece of fondant and stick it back on with more buttercream, and it's gonna look fine again. You send me a picture on my phone right now! The last time the you know what told me it wasn't so bad, I had to redo the whole cake. I want to see how bad it is before I go there and kill him. All right, all right, all right, all right. We got more of that pink? Remy, what was the length of that wall? Cut me another wall. Let's go. I don't think he meant to do it. But, you know, either he had to step on the brakes -- Okay, something had to happen. I'm a little nervous. Just 'cause you never know how Buddy's temper is gonna be. Don't think I'd get fired over something like this. But who knows? I don't want to hear it. Luckily, the cake was so well put together that it was fixable. I just had to fix the back wall. -Got it? -BUDD Y: You get the door. I put it into the memory bank. I was like, "Post-it -- Get Stretch. He's going to pay for today. " Did anybody order a birthday cake? [ People cheering ] MAN: Wow. Look at this thing. BUDD Y: The girls come over, and they're floored. They're like, "Oh, my God! I never seen anything like it! It's the most beautiful thing!" Wow! Thank you so much. BUDD Y: Happy birthday from me. All right? -These are gonna go like this? -JOEY: Exactly like that. BUDD Y: Next morning, we got the front of the truck finished. So now we're gonna start wiring this thing. I'm gonna take it apart and try to keep all the wiring together, just take the components off. BUDD Y: I get the pieces and I'm like, " I got to get the electrical through. " So, what I do is I take a chopstick, stick a hole through the cake so that I have a nice hole. Then I put a little straw, kind of like a pipe, so that we can snake the wires through. Give me those wires, Joey. So we snake the wires through. And then I got to start soldering. And I'm cutting wires from the other fire truck, I'm extending them. It was a real pain in the neck. So after two hours of this, we finally get this thing wired up. Joey runs it all to a switch underneath the cake. Lights. [ Siren wailing ] And I press the button. All the lights work on the fire truck. MAN: All right! M y job is to make people happy. Using real cake, that's what we do. All edible. We got old-school cake in there. As hard as we were working with that fire-truck cake, my team needed a laugh. Your main objective is to keep Stretch in the doorway. I had planned Frankie and Danny upstairs on the roof with a 5-gallon bucket of water and a 5-gallon bucket of flour. All right. Hey, Stretch? What's up? [ Laughter ] Hey, next time, you don't mess my cakes up! This is a family business. If you work here... Stretch, I love you, baby. ... you get treated like family. They fool around a lot, so... Not normally to this extent, but that's all right. It's all right. It's funny. BUDD Y: I knew he was gonna be a good sport, you know? But at the same time, I wanted to teach him a lesson. And I think he learned it. All right, get back to work. Playtime is over. So we got two things to still do -- the fire-truck cake and a cake for my dad's memorial. I'm gonna do my dad's memorial cake first. Cream-puff cake is a cake that my dad invented in like 1982. One of his friends came back from Italy with a bottle of liquor called San Marzano. And my father flavored the cream with the San Marzano liquor. And then we use layers of French pastry, then cream, then sponge. Then we do more cream, French pastry, and then we put the icing over it. I get the cream puffs. I put the cream puffs around. I put the whipped cream on. The strawberries, the kiwis. I finish it with the chocolate shaves. And I'm like, "You know what? I want to top it with a picture of my dad. " What we got is a computer machine where you scan a picture in. But instead of ink, it uses food coloring, which is pretty cool, you know? No matter how crazy things get, my father is on my mind. I still think about him all the time. I got to stop thinking about that and focus my energy on the fire-truck cake. That's actually a good thing. Because you know what? You don't want to be down and somber when you're making a cake that's got to be awesome. He looks like he's maybe coming around the corner. BUDD Y: So, you know, I get the fire truck all done on the cake. I start piping grass. I start putting firemen. We start putting the finishing touches. What else are we gonna do on this board? It's 9:00. It's 9:30. It's 10:00. I'm like, "Wow. It's done. " I'm like, "All right, light it up. Let's see this sucker smoke. " [ Cheering ] Oh, wow! [ Siren wailing ] We were just, like, in awe. The cake was beyond wonderful. It was so phenomenal, it hurt. But it was also 1:30 in the morning. One...two...three. BUDD Y: We had to get the cake downstairs. WOMAN: Careful, Joey. Wait, wait, wait. This has got to go in, Joey. I measured for the elevator. But I measured by the hair of my chinny chin chin. [ Grunts ] Go ahead. Watch the corner. Hold it. Hold it tight. BUDD Y: Late last night, we finished the firemen's cake. Stop! But we had to get it down the elevator and into the fridge. What about the height of this thing? MAN: Watch the little lip. Watch the little lip there. BUDD Y: Nice and easy. WOMAN: Ready? Come down there. Okay. We're in business. It cleared by that much. Whoo! -Okay, get the lock. -[ Laughter ] BUDD Y: Next morning, it's pouring rain, pouring rain. We're about to put the cake in the car, clears up. Come out. Swing. Joey, you and Remy in first. It was the perfect second, 'cause cake and rain don't mix. Joey, go in. No, on the right. Joey's dressed in his fireman's dress clothes. Push it in. No, no, no. Wait. Go in the back. Mauro, Mauro. Go in the back over here. Push it. And me and Remy in our chef coats, and we're pretty excited. -Just stay back there. -All right. I'm being punished? All right. And then we get in the car, it starts downpouring. -[ Rattling ] -Whoa, whoa. Take it easy in front, there! BUDD Y: Soon as we pull up to the place, the rain stops. I'm like, "Oh, man. " It's just my day. Thank God. " I look at the cake. Everything was 100%. Slide. Joey, get the corners. Step one. Two. Three. Okay, easy. Easy. MAN: No, no, no. I got it. Push. That's it. Now you're good. BUDD Y: Okay, you guys are gonna turn. Two, three, up. Okay, go up. More in, guys. All right. Right there. Thank you. I just want to say thank you... ...for all the years of service. We love you, and we appreciate you. I hit the smoke. -I put the sirens on. -[ Siren wailing ] [ Laughs ] Now, it's not a real fire, all right, guys? So nobody jump out of their chairs. -[ Applause ] -Looked real nice. The engine and the hydrant and the man and the dog. Got the chief in front giving everybody orders. That's right. It was like a "tribute to great men" day for me. -How is the cake, guys? -Good. You know, here I am with these great firemen, and now I'm gonna go tribute to my dad, who was, I think, the greatest man ever. -Hi, Ma. -Oh, hi! How you doing? Just to see the unity of my whole family coming together, with all the kids. And you know what? I know my dad was there. And I couldn't have asked for a better mother. During that dinner, I had a little surprise for my mom. It was a tape of the 30th anniversary of Carlo's Bakery. At the time, I was probably, like, 16 years old. Ooh-ma! It was very touching for me. How about you, Buddy? Come up here and say something. It brought back a lot of good memories. BUDD Y SR.: What am I gonna say? The most important thing with that tape is to hear my father's voice. I see all my friends here. I really appreciate your coming. MAMA: How about me? -M y wife. -[ Laughter ] BUDD Y: Just being able to hear him, it touched me. Gone but definitely not forgotten. MAMA: Never. I thought it would only be right to make the cake that Daddy invented. That was his signature cake. WOMAN: Let's hear it for Grandpa Buddy. This week was kind of like a real emotional week. This is my Buddy's cake. -WOMAN: You got a big piece. -Oh, wow! I'm so grateful for all my family, especially my children. They're all the best. [ Applause ] Just to bring him on like this, we can carry the tradition. I wouldn't have it any other way. [ Cheering ] That's who we are. We're family. -Salute. -Salute.
