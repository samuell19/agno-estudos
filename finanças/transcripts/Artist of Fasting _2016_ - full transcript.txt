14 March 2011: An explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Four years ago, at the foot of the mountain, I met a hungry wolf. If followed me at a set distance, wanting to eat me. The wolf had fierce eyes, like I had never seen before. These eyes seemed to have merged into one. The wolf not only bit into my flesh but also into my soul. "Help!" I screamed, but the words never left my mouth. All had turned black before my eyes, there was a buzzing in my ears, and I felt as if my whole body was being scattered away into pieces. Come bear witness to this! The hunger artist, who wanders the perilous border between life and death. What do people enjoy doing the most? To eat! Without eating, life cannot continue. Then why? Why does this man not eat? Without eating, life cannot continue. Then why? Why does this man not eat? Apparently, in a far away land, some man called Gandhi, is goind on a hunger strike to fight against the British Empire. But what are this man's wishes? You'll only find out if you join us! Entry at just ten cents! Come take a close look inside the hunger artist's stomach. He might just pass away tomorrow... During these last decades the interest in professional fasting has diminished. Some time ago, the whole town took a lively interest in hunger artists. It used to pay well to organise such performances. But that is no longer the case. We live in a different world now. What's up with him? How distusting. Don't just sit there. You're in the way. Mister, what are you looking at? Are you hungry? Stay away from him. He's not an insect. If you catch a disease, you won't be able to go to school! Tell me! What are you looking at? What are you thinking? Leave him alone. He's probably just hungry. But he looks just like Rodin's The Thinker. I'm going to put this photo online, okay? That's right. It's for the best if everybody gets along. C'mon then, let's go. Day 2 of Fasting He's here! The fasting man I saw online. What's wrong with him? He's just collapsed on the roadside. It said online it's an act of protest. It's true right? Good luck. What is he protesting about? Okay now, out of the way. You! Lying down and sleeping here is a violation of traffic laws. What's wrong? Are you not feeling well? I was told you're too hungry to move. Can you not walk? If your house is far away, why not rest in the park over there? See? He can't talk. Don't bother the shopkeepers and the passersby. If something happens, the whole shopping street will be in trouble. That will be your responsibility. He doesn't look like he'd hurt anybody. He doesn't look ill either. Let's just leave him. Sooner or later, he'll get tired or bored and leave. Why don't you guys call the health center? We'll do that if he's still here tomorrow. Well, we'll het in touch if there's anything else. I'll occasionally stop by on my patrol Excuse me. Tell us your name please. Day 3 of Fasting Our viewers have many questions. What's your name? Why a hunger strike now? What are you protesting against? Who is your protest targeted to? Is it against the Prime Minister re-militarizing Japan? Yeah! His hunger strike is serious. Report it properly. Yeah! I don't think so. He has nothing better to do. He's just killing time. He's a show-off! What is this all about? When do you plan to stop? Can you share with us your concrete plans? What is it all for? Please say a few words. The media are here right now. It would be honorable to speak to us now. Just a few words will do. Please? We started our protest with a sit in too. Just like him. Day 5 of Fasting Nowadays, such a passive act won't get your voice heard. No! A protest always begins when an individual musters up the strenght. Don't be so foolish. I got it. From today, we shall join him in his sit-in. Let's do it! We shall protest! There he is. Not bad! He's even less cool than I'd expected. I'm going to take photos. Girls! You could definitely be glamour models. Could you pose for us? Be more daring! You'll be an online sensation! Wow, this is great. You want more? Okay everybody, escuse me now. Out of the way... I'm a physician at the health care center. You must prepare properly to fast. It could be life-threatening. It's dangerous. Why don't you stop before it's too late? After a week, it can get really dangerous. If you really want to keep going, I'll come check on you again. Either way, be prepared to stop. Here, take this. Was that old hag for real? Seriously. She did bring some water. The breeze comes from the south Day 7 of Fasting I'll let it take my body Drifting along like a balloon I could fly into the blue sky Sometimes it all gets too much And living feels like a drag - Hey, is everything alright? - Are you okay? Is everything okay? Day 10 of Fasting I told you. Your body can't take it anymore. You can't go on any longer. We'll put you under treatment. An injection? - It's a muscle relaxant. - Are you serious? Is he okay? Don't interrupt the hunger strike! It's a lawful act of protest! It's a violation of human rights! Policeman! Don't just walk off! Second Round of Fasting: Day 1 Mister! The photo of you as The Thinker was a hit at school. I even wrote an essay on you. I'll take another photo. We were worried you died. But they let you out of hospital? Even so, it was serious. If you hit two weeks again, you should just stop. Hey. Stop making such a scene. This time, say what you need to say. Take what you need from the powers that be, and put an early stop to it. In any case, I'm surprised you're back. You're lucky you weren't replaced by an imposter. I'll pop by again after work. Take care. - See you. - Bye. Excuse me. I've been watching you from early on. From over there. For me... Life... ...is suffocating. But I thought your way of life might work out for me. I attempted suicide many times. I failed. I couldn't die. But watching you took away the pain. Second Round of Fasting: Day 7 Who are those people? You've been doing a great job. We welcome the fact that you restarted your hunger strike. We, the Entertainment Show Society, would like to obtain state permission. We want you, the hunger artist, to sign a contract with us. You're lucky! You're no longer just a bum. As an honorable showman, you'll be a noble hunger artist. From now on, you're a showman of the Entertainment Show Society. As an ambassador for peace you'll tour the world, fasting. You must accept your mission to warm people's hearts around the world. You're a hero of our time. People all over the world will see you on the news. They'll stare in amazement and accept you as their hero. Thus, our contract is established. So it has! By starving yourself you'll be fullfilling their need for a hero. You'll be a starvation warrior that unites the world. Here and everywhere, people starve to death. That's daily life on this planet. But nobody is interested in that. People will only show interest in a warrior of starvation. Finally, let me tell you this. You are now our property. Everything you stand for is now under our jurisdiction. That's right. Your freedom is ours. You're under our control. Say goodbye to freedom! Excuse me guys. Please get out of our way. Out of our way! Excuse me, monks. We're going to do work here. It's dangerous. Please stay out of the way. We'll start over there. Before the law sits a gatekeeper.{\i0} To this gatekeeper a man asks to gain entry into the law.{\i0} But the gatekeeper says that he cannot grant him entry at the moment.{\i0} The man thinks about it and then asks if he will be allowed to come in later.{\i0} "It is possible," says the gatekeeper, "but not for now."{\i0} As always, the gate remains open.{\i0} The gatekeeper walk to the side, so the man looks through the gate.{\i0} When the gatekeeper notices, he laughs.{\i0} "If it tempts you so much, don't mind me, and go ahead inside."{\i0} But all he could do was wonder how to get inside.{\i0} Abenomics is just a name. We're in an economic depression. The lives of common people fail to improve in the stock market bubble. Here sits a proprietor whose small business went bankrupt. Please take a look. He's out on a hunger strike. He represents the will of the people. He wants to be on TV so much he refuses food in affluent Japan. This show-off calls himself a hunger artist and acts as if he's a hero. At a time when there seems to be no exit in sight. this man is sacrificing himself in resistance against society. What is your state of mind? Until when will you be on strike? What is your purpose? Do you have family? Aren't your friends and family worried? What is your religious belief? You're Buddhist, right? Or Christian? How would you call your new religion? People say this fasting warrior is under contract with an entertainment company But who runs this company? Why is it that a hunger strike becomes show business? The mystery only deepens. Today, all Japanese citizens would like to know the meaning of all of this. Shrouded in mystery, will this hunger strike bring us anything new? Keep it down! If you don't stop, he'll die. Anyway, you must do your best. Go home! Be quiet! Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, here you see our very own warrior, the hunger artist. Give me your mic. C'mon. Shouldering all of your worries and anxieties this man has stopped eating. He is a holy warrior. Sacrificing himself, he will devour all of your desires. He is the savior of our time, a messiah. This show is so interesting it's almost dangerous. We, the Entertainment Show Society, offer you the hunger artist. If you feel moved or healed, please donate. This hunger artist exist for your sake. All of you in the media... Well, you must seek permission from us. Here is an application form. You must register with us first. Alright then. Line up. Please get into an orderly queue. Day 9 Good luck. Take care. Best of luck. Stay strong. Take care of yourself. Sir. Everything is as usual. Iron bars. Good, good... Good bye now. I'm actually a doctor from {\i1}Doctors With Borders. Let me say this again. More than ten days is dangerous. Even is the media flatters you you must stop after that. Just keep your lips moist with a constant supply of water. More importantly, cast yourself and your worries into my arms. I'll keep an eye on you. Day 11 A sit-in. A hunger strike. He's just like a guardian angel. Perhaps we can make a comeback. Well, we must not be impatient. Thanks to him, our shopping district is as busy as it used to be. He's a powerful advertisement. Hey, you're looking pleased. How have things been? Not much better, I see? Keep your hands off! On the government's request the hospital is trying to take away the fasting man. But he is putting up a fight. Let's get out of here. From now on, it's your own responsibility. I've saved you once already. Please say something. Just one word! Please! The hospital staff have left. We're live on location. This is a place where, for forty years, they have tirelessly eaten human flesh. I only just realized. My brother had taken over the charge of the house, when my sister died, I was young. He may well have used her flesh in our meals. It is possible that I ate several pieces of my sister without realizing. And now it's my turn to be eaten... We shoulder the history of man-eating. We hadn't known before, but now we do. We cannot even hope to face real men. Perhaps there are still children who have not eaten men? If so, we must save the children... Hey, look over here. You're an entertainer, aren't you? Day 13 Give us a smile. - What the hell? - Out of the way. We request for you to immediately stop your fasting. It's a state order. It's the sovereign will of the monarchy that we all fear. You must stop this dangerous activity that leads people into chaos. Before we use our force, we demand for you to restore peace to this place, at your own free will. Whatever happens it'll be your own responsibility. Protect freedom of expression! Resist oppression! Hurry up and take care of this trash. Clean up the maggots! Kill those who pollute this town! When the time comes, we will excercise our force. When the time arrives, whatever happens, he must take full responsibility. In order to introduce peace for all citizens, the state must take care of dissenters that bring about anxiety and misfortune. That is logical. Even if this body perishes... Even if this body perishes... This could work for us. Look over here. The penis-cutter arrives! Take it away, cut it off! I've cut over a hundred, and I'm aiming for a thousand! Men, be prepared! Men, be prepared! Let's die. Let's die. Let's die. Day 14 Let's die. Please accept our apologies. Sorry for bothering you. What are you guys doing? Who are those people? "Let's die." Hey there. Hey. C'mon then. One, two... Keep quiet! Do as I tell you! Go to hell! What a bore. What a killjoy. Let's go back. Let's go back to him. Let's get out of here. Come on. Shall we go to the hospital? No. I'm used to it. I'll be fine. Okay. Let's go back to him. Yeah, let's go back. By the way, why is it that you're there? I'm scared of loud people and places where voices echo. Right now, that place is an epicenter of loud voices. Only he doesn't utter a word. Despite what surrounds him, it feels quiet around him. Just sitting in front of him makes me feel at ease. So was it also scary at home? Yeah. Mom and dad both had loud voices. And, what is it that you're making? I'm not sure. I'm in art school. But I've never completed an art piece. But being there makes me feel like something new might come to me. Being there also gives me a peace of mind. Since the beginning, I've felt like it was a place for me. When I'm near him, I'm unable to ignore the loud voices around him. For the first time, I felt I could create something. To give something a shape... A soul, life and death... People all over the world are wandering around in freedom. Inside of freedom? They are trapped in the prison called freedom. The limits of freedom are a cause of infinite anxiety. So, what's going to happen? I don't know. We are now inside of this prison murdering one another. Are you saying that religion cannot give us strength? It's not just religion. All philosophies and sciences are losing their meaning. That is what we're seeing here. This is what this man represents. Master, but why? Why are we sitting here? I'd like to see the look of this man after forty days have passed. After forty days of fasting, will he equal the enlightened saints? Can he withstand the temptation of Satan? Buddha, Christ and Mohammed all practised fasting. They all resisted temptation and attained enlightenment. But will this man be enlightened after forty days of fasting? I don't know. But I'd like to see it through. Let's go! It's Charlie Hebdo time! Welcome to our Islamic State for good boys and good girls. We consider him to be less than a dog. We are giving pleasure to this dog-like being. At least if you educate a dog, it will obey you. We shall shame those who fail to obey! Je suis Charlie! We shall punish the uncivilised! A holy movement declares a civilization. Glory to our honorable army! Je suis Charlie! Day 30 Are you really not eating? I bet you're eating in secret. Bastard. Good luck! Please don't die. Thirty days have gone by. When forty days have passed, will something become apparent to us? I don't know. But one thing is for sure. The man who doesn't speak or eat. His place in this society... He belongs to the black box of our time, namely, a hollow speck. A hollow speck? Those with flaws in their lives will be beckoned by his nothingness. The absence will give way to presence and fill in the hollow speck. You're saying this man is nobody? Precisely because he is nobody, he might just become somebody. Are you really not eating? I bet you have. Go on, tell us the truth. I'll take a photo to mark this moment. He's still here. Go on, smile! I saw you on the news. I couldn't stay put any longer. I ran all the way from Kyushu! After three generations, I had no choice but to shut our clothing store. If things continue the way they are, my family will commit suicide together. We used to sell this underwear. Please use it. Please also use this. Hey, say something! Hey! Don't be so cold! I thought you'd show me a good way out. I'm here, grasping at straws! The way things are going, he's now just a consultation officer. I'm feeling agitated. I just want to kill people at random. You... I just really want to kill you. Kill. Kill. Die! I want to kill you! Kill. Damn it! As long as that young man comes here, he will not kill. Will the hollow speck fill in his emptiness? Well, he was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread." And then he answered, "Man shall not live on bread alone." Decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you. And to fast is best for you if you only knew. Day 32 Hey again. Looks like you've made good business. How nice your business is thriving. We're going to take some rent. So you're doing this for forty days? Well, take care of yourself. Good luck. Let's go. I'm so bored. Day 33 You're stoll doing okay. Don't forget to drink water. If you've still got so much strength, why don't we do it? Soon you might be stricken by hunger. We'll be back. Doctors are so cold-hearted. Why don't you do a check-up? Maybe I'll tweet this. What's up with you? {\i1}We're Doctors With Borders. We don't waste state money. We operate on the edge. He's a nobody from nowhere. We don't care if he lives or dies. Shall we prosecute you for threatening women? Pow the earth, pow the earth! reversed side of the surface of water, there is smell of (lunar) dust The snow sheets on the Ancient Astronomical ruin look all corpses suddenly shine crimson! Down the European cliff Cradle... Butterfly... Conch... Butterfly Butterfly La La farfalle... Powing the earth, powing the ground, tail After death throw a drop of famed words to the earth throw a drop of ball after death Tail... My body... To tang... Scatered Cavallo Cavallo rosso ...be quiet please, America... Pow the ground, pow the ground... reversed side of the surface of water, there is smell of (lunar) dust Ghi-anda don gri gland... With the tack In Aiowa In a corner of kitchen In autumn of rust On top of caught nail Past what is called Anamushi Pass, and as far as Nijozan, I was gritting my teeth, thinking. Is that an ancient mausoleum, there are several hilly mounds, the electric train was almost on the prefectural border between Osaka and Nara. What do I mean by a way out? I'm deliberately avoiding the word freedom. I don't mean this grand feeling of freedom on all sides. But I myself have never asked for freedom neither then nor now. Besides, freedom is something people deceive themselves with far too often. And as sublime as it may feel freedom can also lead to sublime disappointment. Day 34 Hey! What are you doing to this holy ground? How disrespectful. Such disrespect. It's hard to become invisible It's hard to go back to being an orangutan Don't forget me. Let me exist in your memory. May I stay there? Nothing happened! Understood? Nothing happened. He's not here. He's not here. He's not here... He's not here. He's not here. He's not here... Day 37 For a show-off you've done well. I'm glad I came to see this. How noble of you. You've been on TV so many times. Perhaps, all along, he's been eating delicious food somewhere. Excuse me. Please step aside. Is he from TV? I've seen him on a show. How wonderful. This is original. Real art is something that echoes through your heart. He is not doing anything. He is not eating anything. The art that he pracitses represents people's inner selves. It pulls out the desire that sleeps at the root of humanity. It reveals the existence of our wishes. He is the ultimate performance artist. Let's do an exhibition together to mark the opening of a new museum. Let's do it! I'll make you a star of the new museum. Hello everybody. Welcome to the Humanity Pavilion of the 21st Century Expo in Japan. Japan, the eternal land of gods, will host a performance. Those of you who disobey... Those of you with impure blood... You have strange genes. Just like Native Americans and Ainu. Take a look at these native Okinawans. We'll show you our incredible plan that will reform their spirits. Please watch closely. Right. Now, we'll teach you Japanese. The first thing you must learn is... Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! How was that? Are you shocked? It echoes so proudly. The combination of sounds. The valiance. It's steadiness. It's typical Japanese. Come on then! Long live the Emperor! Do you still not understand? Are you sure you're Japanese? Shame on you! I don't know what's up your sleeve. But my debt keeps getting worse and worse. I told you to be quiet! American soldiers coming back from Vietnam are seething with perversion. I almost feel sorry for them. Especially the blacks who everybody ignores. Silence! I will now read the verdict. Decision. The court has found the suspect guilty. Just now, you have become a widow. I feel sorry for you. I shall console you. - Don't touch me! - There's no need to hold back. Who brought the baby? Make it stop! It's too late. It's dead. Grieving will bring you nothing. You'll soon have another baby. I'll make sure of that! The new Japanese land of Okinawa is now on your young shoulders. Step over the corpses covered in grass. Push aside the corpses soaked in water. Come back to Japan, the living god! Day 38 Perhaps I was wrong. What was it I wanted from this fasting man? Perhaps I demanded too much from him. Perhaps society also did. If we had let him be, he would've been at peace. Perhaps all we did was throw ourselves into confusion. Many attained salvation by fasting and reached enlightenment. Sir, that's what you told me. Are you saying that this man... I'm not sure. In that case, why don't you also practise this act of asceticism? He doesn't have to be the only one. I could do a few days of fasting for my own amusement. But forty days is another story. Are you saying that, after forty days, this man might not attaing enlightenment? I don't know. Right now, all types of religion are losing their meaning. What does it mean to be religious? This man is just an entertainer. Buddha was from a royal family. Mohammed was also well-off. Christ was said to be God's son. They were destined to be born this way, and lived their lives as intended. We don't even know where this man came from. So what? Aren't people born with destiny? Isn't even freedom up to fate? "Celebrating a new world record for fasting" Day 40 What an achievement. At last, a world record! Overcoming all criticism and envy, this man has finally done it. He's now an internationally recognised performance artist. People sought emancipation, kindness and warmth from him. They saw hope in him. But this man overcame all obstacles. So he became a superhuman. From today onwards, he will be the guiding star of our hopes. A certificate of commendation. You showed tolerance and endurance. You strived for selfless devotion. It's been honorable of you to represent Japan as a fasting warrior. We would like to ask for you to do just one more thing. We ask you to be of service to the nation of Japan. The whole country is full of praise for this warrior. Wasn't he mad at him before? Wasn't he telling him to stop? Now he's saying the country is full of praise for him? Try your best, alright? About the gate... How is that in these many years, no one except me has requested entry? I tried asking the gatekeeper again. The fire of my life was about to go out. As if trying to bring back my fading consciousness, the gatekeeper shouts, "Here no one else can gain entry. This entrance was assigned only to you. I'm going now. I'm closing it. What will you do?" Perhaps... Perhaps this man was... He was enlightened from the beginning! Even we were lost. We're far from enlightened. Criticism inundates the hunger artist. A hero of a fallen town Get rid of the hunger artist and clean up the town! We should not permit this foolish act. He's playing around with life. How ridiculous! Stop all this nonsense. Get rid of this filth from our town! Day 44 Hey there. It's all over now. What was all that racket for? It all seemed so fake. This isn't even enough for pocket money. You should hurry up and die, and rest in peace. It'll be on the news. "Hunger Artist Dies" At least you could pay off your rent. Or maybe not. Two gentlemen approached him. One took his hat off, looked around and wiped his sweat with his handkerchief. The logic cannot be refuted, but someone who wants to live will not resist it. Where was the judge he'd never seen? Where was the high court that he had never reached? He stretched his arms out and spread out all his fingers. But the hands of one of the gentlemen were laid on his throat, while the other pushed a gun against his heart and pulled the trigger twice. As his eyesight failed, he could see the two gentlemen, cheek by cheek, close in front of his face, watching the result. Day 49 Let's die! Let's die! What's going on? Hey? What happened? He's dead. And him? Check them all. Dead. Dead. Day 50 I wonder whether any souls were saved? It's over. Nothing happened after all. Even after fifty days, no miracle occured. The end of time will not be upon us. If it goes on like this... Will we just die a slow death in the prison of freedom? I can do it. The shape of his heart. I think I can do it. I'll make it happen. Hey. It's all over. I'm heading off. Anyway, why did you fast? Why did you go on a hunger strike? I just couldn't find anything that I'd like to eat. That's all. But I've just found something. Delicious... A dog... You're like a dog! In his dimming eyes remained the firm though no longer proud persuasion that he was still continuing to fast.
