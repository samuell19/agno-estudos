Fork on the left, napkin on the left. - Choo-choo! - Train! - Choo-choo! - Train! Carrie, we're having dinner! Oh, so Tia, what do you think of your new room? Isn't it big? - It's okay. - What? Sometimes I feel it's really cold, like somebody's blowing on the back of my neck. No... Well, you dressed. Well, yeah, it's Sunday. We're just a little more casual around here, aren't we. So, Tia, I don't think it's anything but a little draft. We have to get used to the new things around here. You used to dress up for Sundays. I know, but I don't anymore. Okay, guys, dig in, everyone. Thanks after that day of work. I know, I'm starving. Okay, you want some corn? And some beans. Some beans? Of course you can. Good girl. Aren't we going to say grace first? No, we don't pray at the table here. Mom! Thanks, honey. - Some green beans? - Sure! Okay. Bless us our lord... And these our gifts which we are about to receive from the bounty of Christ, our lord, amen. Um... Bread rolls, anyone? - Carrie? - No, thank you. Uh, hi, I'm lew Gibson, your neighbor from a couple of houses down. - Samantha Lee, nice to meet you. - My pleasure. Yeah, I've been watching you all day. - You have? - Move in! - Oh, okay. - Yeah, all day. - Long day. - I'll bet. - Yeah. - Right? I brought a little housewarming gift for you. - Thank you! - Yeah. - Wow! That's really nice. - Welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you, look, come on in! Oh, no, you're probably tired from moving all day. No, not at all. Come on! - Uh... you sure? - Yes! It's really nice. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. Sit down. Thanks. You know, we bought the house as is so a lot of the previous owner's belongings are still here. - Oh... - Yeah. - Well, nice piano. - Thanks. You play or your husband? I don't have a husband. Really? Whoa! - Who's this? - This is Tia. Tia... How old are you, Tia? - I'm ten. - Ten. Hmm... that must mean that you go to lamb elementary. Yip-perdy-do-da! Yip-perdy-do-da. Well, I'm the art teacher at lamb elementary. - No way! - Yeah. Oh, wow! As well as the sixth grade counselor helping them transition into middle school. - Wow! - Yeah. How you like school, Tia? - It's okay. - Just okay? We'll have to do something about that. Make it great! Go upstairs and put your pajamas on, honey. Good girl. Don't forget to say hello tomorrow, Tia. I won't. Yeah... just as cute as her mother. You're going to like it here in this neighborhood. We have a lot of single parents, actually. I'm... I'm divorced, actually. And, uh, we have all kinds of parent activities, parents' night out. We do movies, bowling, wine pairing. Oh, well, Sam isn't single. Huh? She's my wife. Oh, hi. Hi, I'm Heather. - Her wife. - Mm-hmm. Oh. That... oh, that's interesting. I... I've never, uh... I've never seen a couple of... womens. Well, here we are. - Yeah. - Yeah. Here you are. Wow! I mean, it's... it's kind of like the Easter bunny or... or unicorns. You always talk about them, but you never really think they're real, you know? So, um... How long have you been living in the area for? - Me? - Yeah. Oh, um... 15 years or so. So you must know the previous owner, huh? Oh, yeah, old man Roberts. Sure, yeah, I knew him, creepy old guy. There's kind of a silly rumor out in the neighborhood that this place is haunted. Yeah, that's why it stayed on the market so long. - We did get a good deal. - Yeah, we did! Yeah, I bet. I bet, yeah. The rumor is, is that um... He was this crazy old guy with a wooden doll, and he collected these Victorian death photos. Creepy, right? Yeah. And so, uh, when he died um... because his family never came to visit him, he's just never left. He haunts the place. Okay, so now wait. He didn't actually die here though, right? Here? No. - He... he died in the hospice. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. - Phew. But he haunts the place here. I don't know. Yeah, there he is. I swear that painting gives me the creeps. - I hate it. - Right? - Yeah. - I love it. I love it when she's scared. I get so much more action. She's so naughty. Stop that. Right... unicorns. Tia, you can't be in my room like this. - Come on. - Well, you can't be in my house like this. Excuse me? Well, if you want to be in my house, you can play with me. Well, you'll have to talk to your mom about that. We could just have a talk, you know. Have some fun. There you are. Come on, honey, no! Tia... you're gonna have to learn to get along. Look, i... I'm so sorry about this space, but, uh, well, I didn't really know you're gonna be coming to visit and... No, I'm so happy about it though. Mom, mom-mom-mom- it's only going to be for a couple of days. I know. There's just no space. Well, I pack light. Oh, god, I remember that. Living out of a suitcase... Your dad... We had to travel the world with a carry-on bag. Here and there, traveling all around. I'm glad those days are over. I... what I really mean is... I hope you got my letters. Yeah, I did. Can you help me with this? Oh... I'm thinking that the best way to kind of organize our lives is that... You know, we all know... What we're all gonna pitch in, how we're all gonna pitch in. And uh... I'm wondering if maybe, oh, yeah. Maybe... you would help me out with Tia, tomorrow especially. We've got this meeting. It's investors in Santa Barbara... yes, mom, mom, I will. - Oh, you will? - Yeah. Oh, thank you. We're just going to leave I think about 5:00, and then... wait, you take that. And then, we'll be back the next morning. I really appreciate it. Okay, I think you're all set up here. Good night. It's really, really great to see you, Carrie. Mom... Do they really not believe in god? Yeah. Why don't you have your pjs on? I wasn't in the mood for pjs. - What are you playing with? - Well, this is Bobby. - Bobby? - Yes. Okay, hand him over, honey, it's getting late. - Why? - Honey, he's filthy. Yes, but he's not filthy on the inside. I don't care what he is on the inside, honey. I'm not about to argue with you, okay. It's too late. You're supposed to be asleep by now. Well, why were you mad at dinner tonight? I wasn't mad at dinner. Why are you even saying that? Well, you weren't happy. And who is the lord and who is Carrie talking to? Okay. It's not that I was mad. Carrie just does things a little differently to how we do, and I don't really like it. Everything else we can talk about tomorrow. Deal? Deal? - I don't think we can talk about it tomorrow. - Okay, hand over the doll. - No, wait. - That's enough. Tia. "Dear god, Grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and wisdom to know the difference. Dear god, Grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things... No, no, no, no! I've been looking for you. No, come on, honey, that's enough. That's enough, honey, - time for... - Tic-tac-toe! - Oh, my gosh. - One tic-tac-toe! You know what time it is. Come on you got school in the morning, Tia. What am I gonna do with you? Tell Carrie good night. - Good night. - Good night. All right, munchkin, come on, let's go put our pjs on. Come on, let's go. - Sam? - Mm-hmm? What do you think of that neighbor guy? Did you see his face when you put your arm around me? He died. Well, he'll get used to us, don't you think? He has no choice. Okay, what was tonight about? Praying at dinner? Are you serious? I know. I know it's awkward, honey. That's not even us. It's so weird. I know, but that's Carrie. That's the way she's grown up. You know that's the way we were all together back then, and... she's earnest. She believes in that and I just... it's just temporary, honey. I mean... so... how many kids move in with their parents just for a couple of months till they get a job or... it's... it's something we're just gonna have to live with for a while, and i... I get it. She's your daughter. So is Tia. We all need to be comfortable. And right now, she's not making any of us feel comfortable. Look, I really appreciate all the effort you're putting into this. I really do. But let's not exaggerate it. I mean, it wasn't that bad. I'm not... are you serious? Every single day we're judged when we leave the house. When I'm at home, I want to be comfortable with you. It will get comfortable! It will get comfortable. - This is our first day. Give it... - Okay. Whatever. Fine! Miss Carrie's comfortable, we'll all be uncomfortable. Where did this come from?! Oh, my god, it's in that picture downstairs. Where did this come from? Of course Tia found it, and she wanted to sleep with it, which that wasn't happening, so, I hid it. Sorry, I forgot I put it there. - That is so weird. - It's weird, right? Oh, my god. I'm so tense. - You're just on edge, honey. - I'm sorry. - Oh, this is so weird. - Yeah. What a day, Sam, what a day. Well, it can only get better. I know. - I love you, honey. - I love you too. Thank you. Thank you. Mwah. I'm gonna get rid of him. Yeah, please do. No! No, I don't! I don't want to go today. No, I don't want to! No! No, I don't want to! Tia! I don't want to go to school! I don't want to go to school! Okay, Tia. No! That's enough, honey. I don't want to go. No, I don't want to! You know what time it is? No, I don't want to! I don't want to go to school! I don't want to go to school! - I don't want to go! - Okay, okay, Tia. You're gonna get to see all your friends. - I don't want to! - Hey, ladies, ladies! - What is wrong with you? - What is going on? I don't know what is going on. - I don't want to go to school! - Honey. I'm gonna go make some breakfast. - Don't make me go! - Tia! Tia, what is going on? You love to go to school. - Honey, honey, - I'm notgoing. Tia, Tia! This is not like you. - Please don't make me go! - Come on, sweetie, why don't you want to go to school? - Hey, mom? - Please don't make me go! - Do you have any toothpaste? - Shh! Um, yeah, but... Hey, you know what? I know! - Let's let Carrie take you to school! - No! That is so fun and she has... please? Look, why don't you take her to school? - No, mom, I have an 8:00 mass. - I know, but you can just go out of your way five minutes, please? It would really help me out. It's at least ten minutes there ten minutes back, mom. I'd be 20 minutes late. - I can't handle this right now. - I can't either! Please. I have so much to do today, Carrie, please? ♪ Baby, I'll take your hand ♪ All right, we're here. My mom always kisses me before I go. Well, I'm not your mom. Oh, hey, Tia! Hi, I'm Rachel. I'm Tia's teacher. Are you ready for class? Thanks for the coffee. You're welcome. You seem like you needed it. Mm. Want to talk about anything? Okay... fair enough. I know you really wanted to go to India with your dad. I'm sorry. If it's any consolation, i'm, uh... selfishly really glad that you're still here. I'm just saying, I don't know who I'd hang out with, if you left. Sorry, that's uh... That's not why I asked you to come up here, actually, but, uh... What are you... what are you doing tonight? Can I take you out? Dinner, something to take your mind off things? Sure! No! No! I have... I have to watch my sister who actually I need to pick up also. Um... do you know what time it is? Uh, yeah... It's... I don't know, probably a little after 2:00... or 3:15. Oh, gosh! Um... what time do you have to... I'm supposed to be there at 3:00. Okay, um... How about I rent a movie and just come by? I mean, you're babysitting, maybe you could use some company? Too far, I'm sure. No, no, no, no. Sure. I will put her to bed around 9:00, so... 9:30? Sounds perfect. Okay. Just, uh, call me later, and tell me where the new place is. Okay. All right. 9:30. I'll be there. Jesus! Oh, I'm so sorry. That was me. Try to give you some more light. Have you seen that bag? It's uh... blue and red. I wanted to take it on the trip with us today. Oh, the girls are gonna be home any second now. Where did I put that? Sam? Is that blood? I don't know. I think it's paint. It could be. - It looks like paint. - Yeah, it's paint. You're right. Okay, I'm gonna get ready. Shit, shit. Mom? - Hey, mom? - Hey! - Oh, hey. - Where's Tia? Um... mom, did you pick up Tia? - No! - I was just at the school and she wasn't there. Are you serious? Well... wait, you were just there? The school's been out for an hour, honey. You were late. Yeah, I was a little late. Did you get out of the car and look for her? Yeah, I looked all over the playground. - Okay... - so did you look in the school? Yeah, she wasn't there. - Okay, give me the car keys, please. - Yeah. - Unbelievable. - Carrie... - I mean, I just thought... - of all the days, please, honey. Oh, my god. Honey, I'm so sorry. - Hello. - Hi. - Yeah... - Sorry. - You look nice. - Thank you. Um, it's really none of my business but... I just left school where I noticed that Tia has been out on the playground all afternoon, ever since school got out. And well, it's a safe neighborhood. Look! I get it. I'm so sorry. - This has been a big old misunderstanding. - You never can tell. Look! I... you know, totally. So, um... I was just running out the door to get her. I know how important it is to make a good first impression as a new family, and I just don't want to see you ladies judged too harshly. You have enough of those lines to cross already, if you know what I mean. Didn't know we were being judged, but um... thank you for the heads-up. - I really appreciate it. - You look nice. Thank you. So... okay. Oh, just so you know, legally, i'm... I'm not allowed to take a child off of school property. I could lose my job. Look, again, I'm so sorry. Um, understood. Thank you again. - Okay. - Okay, you have a good night now. - So long. - Bye-bye. Can you stop moving for one second. - We have to talk about this. - Would you just get ready? We cannot be late for this. And would you just forget about today? It was an innocent mistake. I mean, I'm not going to excuse it. But how many times did your mother leave you at the playground 15 minutes too late. Are you kidding me right now? Come on, Sam, you're overreacting. We have a big meeting today. I know we have a big meeting. I'm just telling you I'm not comfortable leaving Tia with her. - It's gonna... - I'm not! You should. She's very responsible. So I see, as she's shown. Are you kidding me? Look, I don't think that going away for just 12 hours is going to make a big difference. Now, please! We have to start focusing on what is important. We're not even gonna have to stay in this house... keep your voice down! Shush! I'm letting you know, I'm not comfortable. Come on in. Hey, Carrie. Samantha and mom, I want to apologize for my actions earlier tonight and I totally understand if you don't want to leave Tia with me. It was thoughtless and irresponsible... yeah, it was. Sorry. We accept your apology, honey. We appreciate it. - Oh, I think I'm ready. - Okay, I found these. Let me go say good-bye to Tia real quick. Okay. All right, for dinner... Tia, we're leaving. Tia... You scared me. Tia! Tia, open the door. Honey, we've spoken about you locking the door. We don't lock doors in this house. Open the door. Oh, she always does this when we leave. Tia, open the door. Honey, we're leaving. I'm about to go right now. Sam, we have about an hour before we get to the airport! I... okay, I'm coming! Honey, open the door. Tia? Tia. I love you, baby. We're leaving. Bye. Be good with Carrie. Honey, we're leaving. Sam! Come on! Okay, I'll be back in the morning. Are you hungry? Hey, Tom! Tia... Are you hungry? I have a headache. Okay, well... Maybe you should eat something. You want a sandwich? Okay. You'll be very pleased. Thank you. Now make yourself at home while they prepare you room. I'll be right back. Tia, don't come over here, there's glass everywhere. Tia! Did you not hear me? Go sit down, and I'll bring you your dinner. Here is your... - Hello. - What are you doing? - Did I scare you? - Yes! You told me not to ring the doorbell. Keep your voice down. - Sorry. - All right, okay, it's weird. Look at these pictures first of all, okay. There's... there's the pictures and they're weird, - and they're freaky. - Okay. And then I went up to get my Bible. And this is not even my Bible because my real Bible was gone! Okay. What... what are we hearing? That noise. That noise, it's been here all night. Okay. - Okay, - that... let me set this stuff down. What? That's the picture of the old man that used to live here. I took that picture down and now it's back up. Okay, maybe it's... Come here! So this used to be his house? It's nice. It's cold up here. Shh! Tia's sleeping. - Hey, could you come here? - Yeah, sorry. I think the sound is coming from right over there. Well, let's go in there. No, no, no, that's my sister's room. Look, I think you can access it, if you crawled up here. Access? Access to what, Carrie? What are we... what are we trying to do? - The sound. - Yeah, I hear it. I think this house is haunted by the old man's spirit or something like that. I know it's sounding really weird. Carrie, Carrie, you're sounding crazy. No, no, no, it's not just the Bible or the picture downstairs. It's a lot of other stuff, too, like the TV keeps going on and off and then this glass shattered right in my face, like it didn't even just fly... - okay, okay, okay... - it flew into my face and it shattered... And the man's portrait and this Bible! Shh, shh... just try to calm down, okay? No! I want someone to go up there right now! Okay, okay, I'm gonna go up there, - and I'm gonna check it out... - Okay. But I need you to just breathe, okay. Okay. Okay. Just don't let the boogeyman get me, okay? - Stop it! - I'm sorry. All right... Do you see anything? It's fine. - All right, wish me luck. - Be careful. Be careful. - Boo! - Jesus! - Whoa! - Everything okay? I heard you running around from up there. Yeah, everything is great. Okay, and, um, I'm pretty sure that's just your heater. Where did you get this? Oh, it was just sitting at the end of the hallway. I think it's... Hey, hey, why don't you go downstairs 'cause my sister is not supposed to know that you're here so... Oh, okay, I'm sorry. - Okay... I just. - Just, yeah... Tia, you can't be playing games like this. - I have a headache. - Well, it's probably because you've been running around the house like a banshee. You have school tomorrow. Sleep. I don't want to go to school. I'm never leaving. Oh, well, we'll see what your mom says about that. Please don't turn the lights off. Does it make you scared? Yeah... I used to be afraid of the dark, too. You know what helps, though? If you sing a song. Do you know any songs? - No. - No? Okay, well... Um... all right. How about I'll start the song and then you follow me, okay. All right. Um... ♪ Our father ♪ ♪ our father ♪ ♪ who art in heaven ♪ ♪ who art in heaven ♪ ♪ hallow be ♪ ♪ hallow be ♪ ♪ thy name ♪ ♪ thy name ♪ - ♪ thy kingdom ♪ - you shouldn't pray in front of people who don't believe in god. Well, you still need to get some sleep. So close your eyes and I'll be downstairs if you need me. With that boy? No. - Hey. - Hey... She uh... go down without too much of a fight? Um... Maybe you should go. Really? I mean, I will, if you want. How about you just... here, come here, sit down. Please just... just relax for like three minutes. If you want me to go, still, I will leave. You're so tense. Here, I hope it's okay, I sort of showed myself around the kitchen. It took me forever to find that opener, but... I couldn't find wine glasses either, so... there's our elegant option. I hope it's okay. Please, cheers. Just relax. To... unwinding a little bit. - Did you hear that? - Yeah, yeah, I hear it, yeah. Oh, you are really UN-unnerved by this, aren't you? All right. Um, don't judge me. I also helped myself to a laptop... Did a little Google search. What do you think? An exorcism? - That sounds... - Aaron. Like a bit much. It's not really an exorcism, it's... okay, it's an exorcism, sort of. But, look, it... this website says it's sanctioned by the church. It's just... we light some candles, we say a prayer... And... look, I mean... so it's just like a prayer? Yeah, we just... we recite this, we do what it says... And um... we get the devil out of your heater. Look, I saw how scared you were earlier. And if you will feel more safe in this house, I'll be happy to do this with you. This is actually a very detailed diagram. It says usually when a person dies, the spirit will realize what's happened and move on in the afterlife. Every once in a while, the spirit doesn't know that he's dead and he's trapped in a certain location. So should I just put him with the pictures? Uh, put the other candles up there under Mr. Creepy face. Sorry. Here, let's just put it over here. Yeah. It says only by praying will you alert the spirit that it is indeed dead and it must move on. - Sage. - Yeah, sage. We have some actually. Wow! - Wow! - Don't ask. That's awesome. Oof! - Um, we might need like a little plate or something... - Oh, yeah. So we don't burn the bookcase. - Okay. - Awesome. - Um... - Holy water. Yeah, holy water. Some spirits will refuse to leave even after they learn of their own death. Usually this is caused by some kind of emotional trauma. This negative emotion can fester, stripping the spirit of any humanity leaving only an angry entity. Great, that's great. Got the holy water. Aright, good. I've got our Jesus juice. Sorry. Um... That's a cool bottle. Yeah, my dad got it at the Vatican. All right... Well, here we go. Are you ready? All right, if we're going to do this, I think we should try and be kind of like serious about it, and even when we light the giant doobie. Just... light the candles, okay. Okay. Can we start this? - All right! - Sorry... In the name of the father... And the son... And the holy spirit... Amen. "In the name of Jesus Christ, our god and lord strengthened by the intercession of the immaculate virgin Mary, mother of god of blessed Michael, the archangel, of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul and all the saints, and powerful in the holy authority of our ministry, we confidently undertake to repulse the attacks and deceits of the devil." Yeah, sage. - God... - Go! Come on! Okay, it says to wait for the smoke. It says wait for the smoke. God arises, his enemies are scattered... And those who hate him flee before him. As the smoke is driven away so are they driven... Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Keep going, keep going! "As the wax melts before the fire, so the wicked perish at the presence of god. Behold the cross of the lord. Flee bands of enemies." Get the holy water. Okay, okay. Go, go, go, go, go! "We drive from us whoever you may be! Unclean spirits, all satanic powers, all inferno invaders, all wicked legions, assemblies and sects. In the name and by the power of our lord Jesus Christ may you be snatched away and driven from the church of god and from the souls made to the image and likeness of god and redeemed by the precious blood of the divine lamb." - Okay. - Oh, phone, okay. Oh, it's just my mom. Hello. Hey, mom. Yeah, everything's great! Uh, yeah, she went to bed about an hour ago. Yeah... no, no. Okay, and have a safe trip. Mom, mom, mom. We'll talk about it later. Bye. My mom, she's so dramatic. Wow! It was um... interesting. Yeah. You wanna watch TV? Yeah. That's a good idea. Tia! What are you doing down here? Oh, boy, okay... Uh... stay here. Okay... lets... Oh, shit. Shit. Are you kidding me right now? You don't have a temperature. So I'll just turn up the heat. Good night. Why do you hate me? What makes you say that, Tia? You don't want me here. I don't not want you here, okay. It's just that... I have a lot of things going on that I'm not happy with, and that are very frustrating. What are those things? Well, they're things that... That I'll tell you when we're older. Tell me now. No. They don't matter, okay? I don't... dislike you. I think you're a good girl. And this is nothing to do with you or me or us, or anything, okay, so get that silly thought out of your head and... And we'll be okay. You want me here? Oh, Aaron, you must hate me for everything that's happened tonight. No, no, why would you say that? Well, you must think I'm crazy from all the ghosts, and then my sister she's always interfering. No, I've been waiting for this for so long. Oh, stop. No, no, it's okay. It's okay. Oh... it's okay, no... Carrie? Carrie, is that you? Carrie? They play with a lot of passion it's amazing when you play with passion and energy how good things can happen. You had told them more recently that it was time for him to take the next step. What step did he take tonight? Keep it together, man. Aaron, hey, what's going on? Oh, my... what happened to your nose? - I can't be here. - Huh, what do you mean? You gonna be okay? There's something bad here. - There's something bad here, Carrie. - Yeah, okay. We can... we can do something about that. I can't be here. - Aaron, what's the fucking matter! - I can't be here! I was wrong! Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, Aaron! Tia, come on, we got to go. Okay, come on. Come on, Tia! Tia. No, Tia! Come on, come here. Give me your hand, Tia! Come on, don't go, come on! Give me your other hand! I love you! No, no, no, no! Tia, Tia, Tia! Tia! "Hail Mary... full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary mother of god pray for our sinners..." "Hail Mary, full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary mother of god, pray for our sinners, now and at the hour of our death, amen." "Hail Mary full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. "Hail Mary full of grace... The lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus." "Holy Mary mother of god, pray for our sinners, now and at the hour of our death, amen." Tia. Tia! Tia. Tia, we need to leave. Come on. Tia. Tia, we need to get out of this house. Where's my sister? What have you done with my sister? Carrie? - Carrie? - Tia. "Our father, who art in heaven hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us... "Hail Mary full of grace the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus." "Our father who art in heaven hallowed by thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Mom? What the hell? Carrie? Carrie! Mom, mom, mom! Oh, my god! What has happened here? Where's Tia? There was all these things at the door... honey, you're bleeding! The bathroom... Hi. Samantha may we... Speak to you in private? Sure. Is everything okay? Samantha, this is officer Hardy. Hi. I thought I should be the one to tell you I'm sorry Samantha, Tia's dead. Is everything okay? Hang on a second, honey. Excuse me? Is this some kind of joke? I mean, I'm really not finding this funny, so... I'm afraid it's not, Samantha. It seems she was playing yesterday after school behind the schoolhouse, by the air conditioning unit. She was all by herself. There was no one there. - The stairs are so steep... - no. She must have fallen and hit her head. She hasn't even been to school today, so... there was no one there to help her, Samantha. She hit her head. Mrs. Lee, your daughter's body was discovered this morning the coroner's estimated the time of death at 4:00 P.M. yesterday afternoon. Mommy! Jesus! All right, pause. You brought my daughter home yesterday afternoon, remember? I wish the hell that I had, Samantha. I wished I had. She'd be alive today, but I didn't. Honey, I'm so sorry. - Hello. - Hi. Clearly, you were to understand - I'm not allowed to bring... - Officer... - A child home from school. - This man is lying. That is an absolute lie! I didn't bring your daughter home yesterday, Samantha. Please don't turn the lights off. Every once in a while, the spirit doesn't know that he is dead. He is trapped in a certain location. I think this house is haunted. An exorcism? If there's something in the house, we'll get it out. Why do you hate me? Some spirits will refuse to leave even after they learn of their own death. I'll never leave. We drive from us, whoever you may be! You don't want me here. This negative emotion can fester stripping the spirit of any humanity leaving only an angry entity. "Our father, who art in heaven hallowed by thy name thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." Clearly, i... I told you yesterday that legally, I'm not allowed... - legally! - To bring a child home from school. Officer, could you please have this man removed from my property? I don't know who you are. I really don't know what your problem is. But i... just get... absolutely... Mrs. Lee! I'm very sorry for your loss. You'll have to accompany me to the morgue to identify the body of your daughter. I'm sorry, Samantha. Tia? Tia? Honey? Tia? Oh, my poor baby. Tia! My baby... Oh, no! Oh, Tia, I'm so sorry. Mommy!
