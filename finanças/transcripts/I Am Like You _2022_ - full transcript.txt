He's run off school grounds again. He got into a fight with one of the kids. I can't find him anywhere. Umm, yeah, okay. I'll... I'll... I'll be there right away. All right. Bye. Okay, I gotta go. I'm sorry. - Right now? - It's an emergency. I'm sorry. All right. Did you find him? Okay, I'm going to go home. Maybe he's going there. Thank you. Sean! Sean! I'll be right back. I'll leave this here for you. You'll like it. My Mommy made it. I have to go now. I'll come back and see you again. It was nice meetin' you. Are you getting warmer? You're still shivering. Let's get you in the shower and warm you up, yeah? Mom! Mom! Sean? Baby, I'm here. It's okay. Come here. All right. Deep breaths. That's good. That's good, just like that, okay? Deep breath.

Okay? - Okay. - Okay. I'm so sorry, Mommy. I'm so sorry if I upset you. Oh, honey, it's okay. I love you so much. I love you, too. I'm gonna keep him home today to rest. No, thank you.

And I need you to stay home all day, no going outside. Promise? I promise. I'll call and check on you. - Love you. - I love you, too. Okay. Where's your Mommy? We're going to wait for your Mommy to come back. I guess she's not coming. You're lucky I found you. I'll take care of you. Hey, Rosie. Hey, Rosie. C'mon girl. Hang on. C'mon Rosie. C'mon. C'mon.

God damn cur. You're all right, buddy. You're all right. I'm sorry. I'm not seeing anything. I think it's someone else's blood. She's pretty wolf-y lookin'. Yeah. I think she might be a hybrid. Let's get her cleaned up. Let's give her a shot. Okay. You must be Susan. I've thought long and hard about dying. I love life. I love my life. I love my husband, my children and my grandchildren. It's because I love my family that I don't want to put them through this. Lou Gehrig's has no cure and will get progressively worse. There will come a time when I'm not able to do the most basic things. I don't want to put myself, my family through that. I can't say that I'm ready to die, but there will come a time. I'm here because I want to help you. You can trust me. I trust you. Can I ask you a question? Absolutely. Why do you do this? I mean, the assisting. A year ago, my mother passed from cancer. The last six months of her life she endured unimaginable pain, and... all I could do was sit and watch. I wasn't able to help her. Lucky Lucky! Lucky Lucky! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! Lucky, Lucky, Lucky! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon, Lucky! Lucky, Lucky! Hi. Hi. I have good news. Sean's new school is happening. Oh, my God. Deb! Just got off the phone with the principal this morning. They like him. He'll start school at the beginning of the year. That is great news. And we'll do what we decided, you and Sean will stay with me until you find your own place. Are you sure? You're not going to drive an hour every day just to take him to school. From my house, it's a 10 minute drive. Yes, I'm sure. And the dog's okay? Dog's fine, too. You're so good to me. We are sisters, remember? How's he doin'? He's much better. I think having a dog has a positive effect on him. What about the diagnosis? Any progress on that? Nobody knows, Deb. They say he's on the spectrum, but we don't know the best way to help him yet. We just changed his medication yesterday, second time in the past six months. You're such a good girl. Lucky? Lucky? Lucky? Lucky? Luck... Lucky, Lucky. Lu-cky... Lucky. Lucky. Lucky. What... what do you need? Lucky. Lucky. Come on in. Hey, boy. He'll make a good fighting dog. How much you want for 'em? $750. Oh, I can't do $750. How much ya got? Three, maybe $350. Nah, I can't do that. You sure? Yeah, I can't do that. Not even for $400? Nah, I still can't do it. All right. I had an incident last night. I couldn't hold my toothbrush. My fingers wouldn't work. We think it's time. We'd like to know about the process. Um... We use helium gas to induce death. This type of gas... helps prevent the feeling of suffocation and panic before losing consciousness. It's administered through a canister and face mask. This method is difficult to trace if the canister and mask are removed before the death is reported. The end is very peaceful. We're ready to go ahead with this. Hi, Joy. How 'ya doin'? Let me take a look at you. Oh, you look good. Much better than I expected. Hey, Lisa? Has Joy eaten at all? Um, no, actually I'm a little concerned. It's been two days now. Hmm. What's that about, huh? Miss your friend? I know how you feel. I know what it's like to miss someone you love. How about a treat? You wanna treat? No? Maybe later, huh? You eat for me maybe later? You eat for me later? Is that your mom? Tomorrow we'll go see if she's back. I found you in the barn up ahead. Let's go see if your Mom's back. Hi, bud. Is that your dog? Yes. What kinda dog is that? She... she's a mutt. You sure that's not a wolf? Yes, I'm sure. You live around here? Yes. - Where at? - A... a few miles up the road. You know there's been a wolf howling around here. - It's not your dog, is it? - No, sir. You mind if I take a look? For your own good. They're gonna take you away from me. We... we... we can't go back. We... can't go back. Sorry. He'll be all right. We'll find him, he's out there. Um-hmm. It's gonna be okay. The whole community's out there looking for him. They're gonna find him. But it's getting late. Need to go home. He's got Lucky with him. Maybe he'll come there. - Drive safe, okay? - You, too. I'll see you in the morning. Lucky. Lucky. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon, Lucky. Thank you for coming back. Thank you for comin' back. Sean! I'm hungry. Let's sit down and have some snacks. I am like you. I am like you. I am like you. I am like you. I am like you. Go! Go! They're gonna take you away from me! Go! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. Hate's lesson of the day. Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! I can't. I will. Hello. It's a beautiful morning, isn't it? It is. Based on Graceful Exit's rules, I need to inform you directly on the reason why I am here. I am here because you expressed a firm and voluntary need to... end your life. If you follow my instruction, you will die. We can stop now. From this point on, I can no longer assist you. You will have to do everything by yourself. I can only give you verbal communication. Lay back on the bed. Come here, hon, I want to give you a kiss. I... I am going to miss you. I know. It's the right thing to do. Open the bag and take out the contents. Place the mask over your nose and mouth. If you choose to open the nebulizer, you will die. In an hour after I leave, you must call 911 and report her death. You must report that she died suddenly in her sleep. Good girl. Good girl. Oh, yeah. Well, you've been smellin'? It's good to see you hungry. Want another one? Oh, shoot. I'm outta food. Look at that, I'm outta food. Yeah, I'm outta food. Good girl. Good girl. - Get 'em, get on top. - C'mon. C'mon. Don't cur out, buddy, c'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon, boy, c'mon. Bite! C'mon boy, get 'em. C'mon buddy, bite the throat! Bite the throat. Get 'em! Get on top. Get on top, buddy, get 'em! C'mon boy! C'mon! Don't cur out! C'mon. Get on 'em, stay on 'em, don't let him up! Get on 'em, get 'em, get 'em! Don't cur out! C'mon, bud! C'mon, man! Shh. Shh. You're okay. You're okay. Shh! Sean, c'mon, let's go. I don't wanna drive when it's too... I know she's coming back. C'mon, honey. Aunt Debbie's waiting for us. Let's go. - Lucky! - Sean, please. Come on. Sean? Sean! Sean! Sean, can you hear me? I'm an EMT, I'm here to help you. Can you straighten your body out for me? I'll put this hood under your head so it's not as cold, okay? Can you open your mouth for me? Stick out your tongue? Anything in your mouth today? No? Can I put my hands on your ribs here? Big breath for me. In and out. One more. In and out. Good job. I'm going to feel for some pulses on your wrists. All right, doing really well. No pain up here? - No pain in your arms? - All right, why don't we get ready to move him? No pain in your hips? Your legs? All right, you got the head? I got the head. Okay. So, Sean, just stay stiff as a board for me, focus on that breathing, and on three, we're going to lift. - Ready? - Yep. One, two, three. Good job, Sean. You know, doing great. See, there you go. Good job. Good breaths. Put a couple of these seat belts on ya. Yeah, it's... It's all gonna be okay. Careful. Mom? Yes? Can we please find Lucky? We will. We will, I promise you. Just rest. Deep breath. I'm gonna put a mask on your face, Sean. -All right -Here it comes. Strap behind your head. Just take some deep breaths for me and try to stay quiet, okay? You're doing so well, baby. Just keep breathing. We're almost there. Deep breaths. Good job. Good job. There you go. Not me, over there. Attack. Attack. Attack! Attack! Attack! C'mon. Attack! Attack. No, attack! No, I said attack! C'mon! Attack! C'mon. Attack. What a waste! Waste of my time! You're both a waste!

Hey, girl! No! Wha! What's the update on Lisa? Over 30 stitches and surgery, and they don't know if there's going to be permanent damage or not. She got mauled really badly. There's something you have to see. Hello. My name is Sean. I'm looking for my lost dog. Her name is Lucky. Here's a picture of her. If you've seen her, please call me. Thank you. That's her. Joy is Lucky. Mmm. Yeah, it's her. How much time do we have? County says she has to be euthanized within 48 hours of the attack. Call the boy. Are you sure? It might not be safe for him to see her. - No. Call the boy. - All right. I promised I'd take care of you. But I wasn't able to. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I'm so sorry. Lucky? Lucky? Are you not feeling well? I'll make you feel better, I promise. You always made me feel better, and now it's time I did the same for you. When I found you, I told you I'd never let you go. We need to let Lucky rest. Mom, Lucky is very sick. I know. Can we come see Lucky again tomorrow? Of course. I'm leaving. Any word on Lisa? I just got off the phone with the hospital, they don't think there will be any permanent damage. Good. - Good night. - Good night. Be in peace. He's been dressed and ready to come since six a.m. I'm glad you're here. Come on in. - Good morning. - Good morning. Can I see Lucky now? Lucky isn't here. Where is she? She isn't with us anymore. She's in a different place. What kind of different place? A peaceful place. She died? Yes. But she's my best friend. And she always will be your best friend. She will always be with you, right here. Always. You know, she needs a friend just like you. Hi. Siblings in Christ, grace to you and peace from God our Holy Parent, and from Jesus, who is our Lord and Savior. Amen. In our first lesson this morning from the Hebrew scripture, we see that God has given humanity a special place in creation. We are created in the image of God, and God said to our first ancestors, be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth. That's Genesis Chapter one, Verse 28. The thing is, we've confused dominion with domination. Our job is to care for and tend creation, from the air and water and soil to livestock and fish and even our beloved pets. Even in relationship to one another and to the communities we live and work in, God entrusts the care of creation to humanity, to us. We don't always do a very good job in terms of the whole of creation and time and our relationships with ourselves and with one another. We don't have to look any farther than the bathroom mirror to find someone who is guilty. As St. Paul writes, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. But the good news is that's not the end of the story. God doesn't leave us in our guilt. God is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. In Christ Jesus, there is grace. In God, there is forgiveness. I'm sorry. I'm guilty. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry.
