The inspector might have at least waited until morning. I mean, a job like this in the middle of the night. And with a full moon. Come now, Muller, stop complaining. The inspector needs a postmortem right away. I saw all the victims. What a horrible sight. I'm used to seeing death, but this goes beyond anything I've seen. Everyone thinks a werewolf did the killing. And they're convinced that werewolf is the body we'll be carrying out an autopsy on. Ignorance and superstition won't disappear from their minds. Too bad. His name was Waldemar Daninsky. Right after he came to Altsee, the horrible murders commenced, and they were all committed on nights with a full moon. Werewolves, silver bullets, and all that nonsense. Mysterious deaths in the Space Age. Absolutely ridiculous. There are mysterious forces we ignore on Earth, and when those forces are unleashed, they can lead men to worse things than death. And there is very little that science can explain. Please, Muller, stop talking nonsense. Doctor Hartwig, look at that scar. It's pentagonal. The mark of the werewolf. I'll start with an incision in his chest. Don't you want to start on the stomach? He's supposed to be a werewolf, right? According to the legend, if we take the bullets that killed him, he can come back to life. Let's see. Please, will you get me the other scalpel? I'm going to take out the silver bullets, and I assure you he'll stay as dead as before. How are you getting on with the essay you're writing? You're almost finished, right? I'm still working on it. It's not easy. There's so much to write. Let's see whether I remember It's something about black magic, witchcraft, professed worship of Satan, and the Inquisition in France. Is that right? Fairly close. Lately, Genevieve and I have found some stuff about Wandesa D?rvula de Nadasdy, a Hungarian countess from the 15th century. There's quite a legend about her. A rather horrible one. She participated in witches' Sabbath and worshipped Satan. She sacrificed beautiful damsels to drink their blood because she also had the mark of the vampire. Then, the witch hunts began. The inquisition tried to condemn her, but all who tried her were mysteriously murdered. One night, the Countess died. Somebody stabbed her in the heart with a silver cross. The Cross of Mayenza. - What happened to her corpse? - It lies buried in a secret place. Genevieve and I have come across an old map that describes the place where the tomb can be found. It is in the north, near a godforsaken village. We leave tomorrow by car. But I'm scared. Your enthusiasm is very contagious. I wish I could go with you, but I must go to Istanbul. Drug trafficking. My dear police officer. Please don't take unnecessary risks. Don't worry. I've seen all the James Bond pictures. I know all his tricks by heart. Let's dance and forget about witchcraft and drug trafficking in Istanbul. I will try to convince you to marry me. And that's all we'll talk about, okay? Okay. Not a single sign. Not an indication. We've been driving on this road for miles. Maybe that silly village just melted away. I told you, we should have asked the man at the gas station, at the crossroads, before we took this mess of a road. I'm afraid we're lost. We should have already reached the village. Soon it will be dark, and I don't like it. And we're almost out of gas. What a place! It creeps me out. Perhaps Count Dracula will appear and kindly invite us to spend the night at his castle. Let's go. Look. It looks like there's someone at that house. We'll ask for help. Is there anybody here? Is there no one around? Good evening. My friend Genevieve Benoit, Waldemar Daninsky. Nice to meet you. Your friend told me what's wrong, and the problem seems hard to solve. I'm practically the only one around here. The monastery and the farms have been uninhabited for years. And what about the village? Is it far? Yes, it is. Quite far, in fact. I'm really sorry. Please, could you put us up for the night? Tomorrow we'll try to reach the village, one way or another. I suppose we can find some gasoline. Couldn't we try to go now? Have you got a car? No, I don't even have a bicycle, and the village is over 20 miles away. Listen, I've come up with a solution. Be my guests for this week. Pierre, my handyman, is coming on Sunday. He has a car and can take you to the village. You can get gasoline and come back for your car. Have you got a telephone? Sorry, no telephone and no electricity. I'm a writer. I was looking for a place to be alone. I found an old house less than a mile away from here, I rented it, refurbished it... and I've been living there for more than six months. However... sometimes I miss having someone to talk to, so I welcome the opportunity of having guests. Thank you, Mr. Daninsky. We'll be your guests till Sunday, and you won't complain about lack of conversation. I'm writing a book about Gothic monuments. The monastery you saw this afternoon is a real treasure. Here, in the north of France, there are many buildings that are practically unknown. Will you have your book published in France? No, I don't think so. It's for the University of Cologne. As we told you, Elvira and I are writing our final thesis. That's why we are here. Perhaps you could help us, since you know the area so well. I'd be glad to help you. What is it you are looking for? We are looking for the tomb of a famous witch, a countess expert in black magic who turned into a vampire, the female version of the Marquis de Sade. Her name was Wandesa D?rvula de Nadasdy. If you will excuse us, we're a little tired. Are you coming, Genevieve? Yes. Good night, Mr. Daninsky. We'll see you in the morning. Hope you sleep well. I hate cold water. Tomorrow I'll complain to our host. Elvira, are you coming to bed? - What's the matter? - Genevieve, staying here is just crazy. There wasn't much we could do. This man has been lying the whole time. There are strange things going on here. Did you notice how the table was set? Only a woman could have that touch. Besides, he told us that there was no electricity, yet I saw bulbs and switches. Why don't they work? Okay, so the table was properly set, but all he sewed was a dish of cold cuts. He could have done that himself. As for the electricity, maybe it hasn't been connected yet. Another thing. Did you notice how upset he became when I mentioned Wandesa? He almost fainted. Elvira, come now, go to bed and stop making up wild stories. I'm convinced that he is the kind of person who helps others. I don't think he's that strange. He just wants company and conversation. That's all. Genevieve, there is no lock. That means we'll have to leave the door open. Cut it out, will you? Please, let me sleep, Elvira. I'm tired. Don't be afraid. No vampire is coming into the room. This isn't Dracula's house. Take a couple of sleeping pills. They're not very strong, but they will do you good. You'll sleep like an angel. It's been an awful day. You took some, didn't you? Sure, I always do. Please, let me sleep, I'm tired. Please, go away. It's full moon. Please leave... If not die. Werewolf. Please, calm down. Tomorrow I'll explain. You should try to rest now. That woman is my sister. There's nothing you should be afraid of. She won't do you harm. She's mentally disturbed. I never thought she'd dare do this. I'd like to apologize. Don't worry, it's all over. Your sister scared me. I was nervous and tired. Seeing her here was a tremendous surprise. But I'm much better now. I'll have some rest. Right, tomorrow I'll explain it whenever you want. She's not all right, but she won't do any harm. Try to sleep now. Good night. Good night. Years ago, my family had a serious accident. My sister, who's never been strong, was badly disturbed, but she isn't dangerous, so I couldn't put her in an asylum. I preferred to isolate her from society because it would've made her life miserable. That's why I came to this lonely place. She's fine here, takes care of me... keeps the house, and on the off chance that somebody comes to see me, she hides in her room. - Why didn't you tell us this before? I was afraid of scaring you. I preferred to wait. But that reaction... By the way, do you remember what she said to you? She talks nonsense sometimes. I don't remember anything. It was all so confusing. She seemed to want us to leave. Help! Genevieve. They are my last hope. If you go on frightening them, they'll leave even if they have to walk. You could have killed that girl. She was in the shack, looking at the chains. She found out everything, Waldemar. There's nothing to find out. Everything's secured. Elizabeth, please, leave them alone. I beg you. We should leave. It's the most sensible decision. I don't mind walking 30 miles. - Not even 30,000. - No, to hell with sensibility. We'll stay. Don't you realize that she almost killed me? I don't trust her sweet, kind little brother. Only God knows what they dare to do. Waldemar isn't a bad person. He won't let anything happen to us. He'll keep an eye on his sister. He needs help, too. He's had so much bad luck, just like his sister. They live with a terrible burden. We have to find out what it is. Right, but what did he say about the chains and the blood stains? There is a lot of big game here, deer and wild pigs, and the former owner used to skin them there. Yes, it's possible, but I warn you, if that crazy woman appears again, I'll leave so quickly you won't see the dust from my shoes. Elvira, be careful. Don't let your soft heart lead you into trouble. You could regret it. Let's go downstairs. We'll show him our documents. He seems to be interested in helping us. Too interested, I'd say. There's no doubt. It says something about a place called Devil's Crossing, near the chapel of Saint Anne. There was a monk there, disciple of Satan, called Baptiste Verdung, who celebrated black mass under the direction of the Countess of Nadasdy. I know where the crossing and the ruins of the chapel are. Aren't they near the monastery we saw? The tomb is only a few meters away, though I've never thought about it. It was very stupid of me. All right, we'll go tomorrow. In the old clays, those who committed suicide or who were executed for practicing witchcraft were buried at a crossing like this one. They then became ideal places to summon Satan or celebrate black magic. If this document is correct, this must be the tomb. Wandesa D?rvula of Nadasdy, 1452- 1480. Satan's mistress, she found the death she deserved. No one must disturb her rest, may God have mercy on her soul. It wasn't a legend! She existed. We found the tomb like we wanted to, right? Let's not profane it. Let's go. Nonsense! We won't be sure she's there until we've opened the coffin. Besides, I want to take some photographs. They'll be wonderful, and we'll be famous! As you wish, but I won't stay here when you open the coffin. I'll wait for you near the ruins of the chapel. Don't worry. This will avoid a hemorrhage. Thank you, Mr. Daninsky. The legend says that if the silver cross is pulled out of her chest, Wandesa would come back to life and that the breath of her resurrection would be red. It's only a legend. Where is Elvira? She didn't want to see the body of the countess, so she went to the ruins of Saint Anne's chapel. Excuse me, could you tell me...? The handyman is coming tomorrow from town. I'd like to be in Paris by then with all our friends, in the middle of traffic, with life pulsating around us. I'm longing to talk to Marcel. Marcel? I don't believe you. You're interested in someone else now. Maybe, but everything is so strange here, so absurd. I'm beginning to think that everything is unreal, like a dream, and when I wake up, no dead people will resurrect, there'll be no vampires, no ghosts, nothing. And Waldemar won't exist either? Though you were in his arms this afternoon, he's also part of our delusions, like everything that's happened since we started this awful trip. If Marcel were here. He's a policeman, and I'm sure he'd find an explanation for everything. The truth is that I'm getting more and more frightened. Elvira, do you know any prayers? Of course I do, why? Then pray. It's all we have. Pray with all the strength of our faith. I'm thirsty. I'm gonna go to the kitchen to get some water. Can I get you something? No, thank you, but don't stay too long. I don't want to be alone. Come... Come to me... "When there's full moon on the same night as the Night of Walpurgis, the cross made from the chalice of Mayenza will stab the heart of the man who suffers from being a werewolf. If the woman who loves him risks her life and does it, light will beat shadows and the soul of the doomed man will have peace forever." Genevieve? Genevieve? Elvira... Elvira... Genevieve, my God! Come... Come with us... Mix your blood with ours, and you'll enjoy all pleasures. Satan still has power. Stupidly, people keep ignoring his strength. Wandesa has come back to life, along with Verdung, the evil monk. They'll gather more and more power. And the most terrible thing is that the Night of Walpurgis is near. All evils will start again. According to the legend, Satan appears on the Night of Walpurgis. This is the eternal fight man has faced since his creation. His pride is his damnation. The fallen angel tries to take man to the breaking point so that he surrenders forever. - So what are we going to do? Pierre won't be long, and you'll go to town with him. And then, when you come back, you'll return to Paris. We should inform the police, let all the people in town know what has happened. - Together, we can fight. - There's nothing anyone can do. I must fight alone. You have to believe me. Genevieve is still here. I won't leave her... or you. I won't leave you because I love you. I love you with all my heart, and while we stay together, I won't be afraid of anybody. Elvira, Pierre must be about to arrive. Go to town and bring some gas, because we'll need the car. I'll stay here. I have to do something, and I can't accept any help. Take this cross, and keep it with you at all times. It's the only thing that can protect you against Wandesa. Elvira. I'll introduce you to my girlfriend when we get to the village. Her name's Mabille. You'll like her. Would you take me to the post office? I have a letter to mail. There's no post office in the village. If you want, we can leave it at Jean's inn. Every Friday a van comes and takes the mail. Listen. People fear those who live near the monastery. And they say I'm crazy for accepting a job from Daninsky. Before your friend came to live here, the house already had a bad reputation. It was built by a family called Jacquier. They came from the south. But one day, old Jacquier hung himself. Soon after, his son Jacques died in a hunting accident. His rifle exploded, and the explosion blew his head off. These things happen, they do, but people started gossiping and saying the house was haunted. The fact is, the widow decided to take off and asked me to rent out the house. I rented it to Mr. Daninsky, who came to live with his sister. Since the poor old devil wasn't quite sane, people kept on making up stories. One night the transformer was struck by lightning. The power in the house went out. No electrician would come fix it. What do you think? And the stories about the curse started again. People. Well. Poor Elizabeth. The curse had to get you, too. But I'll save your soul. The evil powers of Wandesa won't harm you. What I'm about to do with your body is the only salvation for your spirit. There will be a full moon tonight. Wandesa will be stronger than ever and ready to attack again. You can't sleep here. Sleep in the old wing and lock your door. Don't you put down that cross for a single second. You're staying with me. You're in danger, too. No. That's not possible. I've got something important to do. Why should I lock the door? It won't make a difference. If you love me, do as I say. It's the only solution. Don't you understand, Elvira? Do as I say and don't go out till dawn. Come. The curse caught up with me in Tibet. That's when I turned into a werewolf. Then I managed to hide in a village on the Austrian border. Elizabeth would help me by chaining me to the wail whenever there was a full moon, but once I managed to escape and I murdered some innocent people. Murders kept happening. The villagers found me, and they shot me with silver bullets. Ever since I've been forced to wander between life and death. Fear and hatred chase me. Only love can help you, right? Only love can drive the hand that stabs me with the cross when there's a full moon. That's why you were looking so desperately for the cross. Misfortune brought you here. And I forgot all the horror I might cause. Genevieve's blood brought Wandesa back to life. It did. She turned your friend into a vampire, and she tried to do the same with Elizabeth. My poor sister. Elvira, you could be her next victim. Wandesa will stay alive until the Night of Walpurgis. Then Satan will come and help her, and they will dominate the world. We must find where she's hiding and finish her off. There are so many places to look. The old farm, the monastery ruins, the cemetery. We'll try. Her evil power ends where the power of the cross begins. I'll go check the cemetery. Genevieve hides there. Yes. Vampires sleep in graves. You must leave. I won't let you run that terrible risk. Where am I supposed to go? To the village? The people are ignorant and easily aroused. Pierre must have told them many things. Maybe they already know what you saw last night. Besides, Wandesa will want revenge on them, since it was their predecessors who caused her death. I'm not leaving. I'll be with you until it's over. Easy. It's over now. There's nothing to be afraid of. Genevieve attacked me. The cross couldn't keep her away. She must have contaminated me. My God. She'll never ever return. She doesn't exist now. And that mark she left on you won't have any effect. Genevieve is now free. At least you've saved her soul. Pray for her. That's the only thing you can do. We've been roaming around these ruins for day, and we still don't know where she's hiding. We still have to check the passageways and the catacombs. They form a maze, and Wandesa knows it by heart. What's she up to? She hasn't been back since Genevieve's death. There will still be a full moon tonight. You must chain me to the wall. Don't go too far, and for the love of God, don't put the cross down. Police? Captain Fonteyn, please. Boss, this is Inspector Marcel. I finally have some news. Yes, a letter. But there's something I don't get. I'm concerned. I'm concerned. The letter comes from Gilben, in the north, but it was written in a place called Village des Chats. I think it's a small village in the mountains. Apparently, they don't have a post office there and they have to take their mail to another village. I was informed at the post office. Yes. I assure you it wasn't easy at all. Let me tell you, boss, I'm very concerned about all this. How much time do I need? One week. Yes, a week should do. Thank you, boss. I'll find it. I'm leaving tonight. Thank you. Wandesa, here's your prisoner. I obeyed your orders. You command and I always obey. What do you want me to say? I've never heard of those two women. I can assure you they were never here. Take a look at this letter. It was sent from Gilben. Please check the stamp. You're a good cop, very persistent. You've been asking around, the police, the doctor, the pharmacist, even the butcher. As you can see, I'm very well informed. And everybody has told you they haven't seen those women. I honestly don't understand why you're so insistent. And now... taste our wine. It seems very light, but it has a gradation of 18 degrees. Honestly, Mr. Mayor... I've seen strange things. And, strangely, I believe that the people from this town... are afraid. They feel insecure. Everyone's whispering. What is it that you're afraid of? Come on, you people from the city are always suspicious. There's something else. What about security? It is being said that there is some kind of plague. Why don't you ask for medical assistance? It's unbelievable. People live here like it's the Middle Ages. Are you making an official accusation? We have doctors and police officers here. You have no business telling us what to do! I warn you I'll stay here to solve the mess here, and whatever I find out, I'll blow the lid off it. Afterwards, we'll see. Stop talking nonsense! What do you mean? Sit down, please. Let's try not to overreact. Yes, I understand you're worried about these two friends of yours. I'll try to help you in everything that I can. I'll find out if someone has heard anything about them. I assure you nothing serious has happened here. Nothing to be alarmed at. Have some women died? Yes, they have. But because they were ill or had an accident. But what's important is that their death certificates are in order. Don't look for murders or murderers. Of course, there's always people who imagine things. There are stories. But can we consider that a crime? They're talking about black magic, witchcraft, curses, and my girlfriend studied those subjects. I even heard talk about a werewolf, about vampires. I don't know what else. A lycanthrope. - What? Don't be surprised. I'm not as ignorant as you think. Lycanthropy is a kind of madness where a man thinks he becomes a wolf. If we accept that, why not accept, too, that some people believe they've seen werewolves. You can't arrest them for that, for having an imagination. No, not for that. But if someone wants to kill someone who says he's a witch, a werewolf, or a vampire, it is my duty to get involved. And I see many threatening faces in this town willing to attack, although I don't know whom. And are you going to start a process based only on those stories? Please. First I'll start by looking for Elvira and her friend. Then we'll deal with the rest. Then you'll be able to explain your theories, Mr. Mayor. We'll meet again. Elvira, I know our love has no future... but I love you. You're the first woman who has ever loved me. You're my only love... and my salvation. A glass of wine, please. Have you seen the funeral? Another girl. No one knows her cause of death. But I know the secret. Hey, it's not a girl who arrived recently with a friend, is it? No. It was not her, but I know who you're talking about. Do you know where she is? I know she's been living in the old house that belonged to the Jacquier family. In the valley, in the old road. But trust me, don't go anywhere near it. It's a cursed place. There's a man there who behaves as Satan himself. I warned my poor Pierre, but he didn't listen. Poor? Why? What happened to him? One day he went down to the monastery to visit the Tomb of the Knight. He started behaving strangely. In fact, he didn't listen to me at all, you know. I'm sure he's been bewitched. One day he left and never came back. I don't believe in superstitions. Police, huh? You're used to dealing with criminals, bandits, gangsters. But all of them are humans. In the valley, everything is a mystery. There are monsters. And we're going to have a full moon soon. Inspector, don't trust anyone and be very careful. Who are you? Why are you attacking me? Speak! Everybody hates you. No one dares stand up to you. And they let you kill and murder. You have a plague with you. A Plague? The young women die, drained of all their blood. My wife was expecting a child, and it's your fault they both died! Mabille told me. She said, "Kill him! "Destroy him, he's a warlock. "My poor Pierre disappeared. "He'll kill us all. Look for him at the monastery." I hate you. You killed my wife and my son! You're... the Devil... the Devil! - Elvira. - Marcel. Listen to me, Marcel. I know just how much you're suffering and that what has happened is very hard to explain. All I can tell you is that Genevieve is dead. Yes, as you heard. And Elvira will die, too... unless you take her away at once. I know you love her. And you're the only one she trusts. Your presence here is very fortunate. Take her away immediately. There's no time to waste. I've talked to many people in town. They all fear you. They hate you. Many young ladies have died in strange circumstances. Village superstitions ignorant people believe. They keep talking of witchcraft, curses, vampires, and of a werewolf who shows up whenever there's a full moon. I've also talked to a woman. She's the one who said that Elvira was here in your house. It seems she was your handyman's girlfriend, a guy named Pierre. She talked to me about the ruins of an old monastery and of a place known as the Tomb of the Knight. The Tomb of the Knight? Naturally, I don't believe those stupid tales, but I'm convinced that behind all this... there's a criminal imagination. Don't you have anything to say about that, Mr. Daninsky? I can assure you that despite all that's against you, I am willing to believe you. As for Elvira, I know she had nothing to do with anything that happened here. Elvira must leave this place at once. Nothing else matters. - I'll persuade her. - All right. But let me warn you I'll return with a few of my men to solve these mysteries. You will have to provide a convincing explanation. And the town people will be thoroughly debriefed. I'll give you some advice. Be very careful. The county farmers hate you and are willing to do anything... even kill you. It wouldn't surprise me if they came and hanged you. They've tried that before. Marcel, go back to civilization. Take care of Elvira. You must persuade her. She won't listen to me. Listen to me, Elvira. If you really love me, leave forever. I'll need the cross, and if you stay I'd have to let you have it to protect you from Wandesa. Genevieve is dead and Marcel might have the same fate. - I don't want to leave you. Wandesa is after blood. I must destroy her before she turns more innocent people into vampires. The horror must cease. I know where she's hiding. Leave, I'm begging you. That will be a test your love for me must pass. Tomorrow will be the Night of Walpurgis. Wandesa will be stronger than ever. I can destroy her before that. Once she's dead, peace will reign once more. Her victims won't have died in vain. Elvira. The Tomb of the Knight. It's still too soon. Tomorrow you'll be turned into slaves of Satan. My revenge will then have been fulfilled. While you're in my power, Waldemar won't dare attack me. Satan will come. You will belong to Him. Your blood will conjure Him. Here's my Lord. There will be a full moon any minute. I must accomplish my mission. Your blood will be His breath... and He will rule the world at last.
