Wake up, we're here. - Thanks for the ride, Gennaro. - You're welcome. There she is. Nevia ! Why are you so late ? I've been queuing since 4 a.m. ! Grandma, I'm doing you a favour by being here. I'm not even related to him. But your sister has to see her father. Calling numbers 180 to 190. Stop ! Wait. Stay close to me. Good morning, Nana. Hi, Salvatore. Hi, Enza. Hi, Nevia. - Do you want a lift ? - Yes, please ! I have errands to run at the prefabs. Let's go. Come on, Nevia ! Grandma, but we're nearly there. Stop arguing. Listen, Nevia, I'm going shopping tomorrow, if you wanna come, I'll buy you something. No, thanks, tomorrow I have to work. - Just go. - Mind your own business ! Don't worry. - Thank you, Salvatore. - It's a pleasure. - Grandma, I'll give you a hand. - No, go get your sister. Hi, guys. Turn down the volume ! Good one. Everything OK ? - How are you, Anna ? - All good, and you ? Are you playing pool tonight ? No, I'm busy. - But you never come ! - Next time. - How's it going ? - We're almost there ! - Come on Enza, let's go ! - Wait ! I'm coming ! How is it every time I come I have to start over with this cleaning ? You're fixated with cleaning. I have a fixation, eh ? It's all sticky here ! Hey, Auntie. - Smells good, what are you cooking ? - Pan-fried greens. We'll eat soon. I'm so hungry ! - Shall I sort out the shopping ? - Yes. - Take a look. Did you get pasta ? - Let's see. Tomorrow I'll make pasta and potatoes. No, Auntie, but she got chocolate. - Chocolate, what will I do with that ? - I know you like it ! Let's see. Where is the little one ? She never does anything. She's outside. - What's that, Grandma ? - Go get your sister. Everything OK ? - Yes. Get your sister so we can eat. - OK, then. What is it ? - What is it ? - Leave me alone. Look at your face ! What happened ? That shithead ! He was dealing behind mine and Peppe's back. The situation is bad, look here. Who will tell Peppe ? I'm in trouble. Your son always gets you in trouble. OK, let's see... I'll keep this paper, OK ? Let's eat, relax and decide later. Hey Ju ! You do this every night ! When will you get a new key ? Tomorrow. Go to bed now. Good night. Grandma. - Grandma. - What's up ? - When will she leave ? - Why do you care ? Sleep. At least she pays. Enza. Nevia, what do you want ? Wake up. - I'm sleepy. - We have to go to school. Leave me alone. It's like that ? Get up. Don't make noise, or Grandma will wake up. Come on. Who invented this school thing ? Put your slippers on. I don't wanna get up early. I'm sleepy. Couldn't it be in the afternoon ? Like at 1 p.m. What are you saying ? Come on, pee now. Why do I have to go to school ? I don't wanna go ! Come on. You have to go to school, you have to learn to read and write. - I can already read and write. - Ah, yes ? Listen, you don't decide here. You have to go, otherwise what life will you have ? Are you done ? Get up. Why don't you go for me ? I'll stay here sleeping. Shut up ! Hurry up, we're going to be late. This is great ! - Are you ready ? - Yes. Hold on ! Be careful ! You be careful, eh ! - Oh, Nevia, are you nuts ? - Shut up, I got this. - Hi, Dorì. - Hi, Nevia. - You well ? - Yes ! - Is Grandma at home ? - Yes. - Look, here's the trash. - Thanks. Wait, I should have some change. - This is for you. - Thank you. See you later. - Good morning, little one. - Hi, Taranti' ! - Come on up. - I'm coming. I made a cake. I've left some for you. Eat it. And then tell me how is it, OK ? - Thanks, Taranti'. - Take care of yourself. - Don't you have any trash ? - No, tomorrow we'll see. - Bye. - Bye Taranti', thank you. - Who is it ? - Auntie, it's me. One second ! - Every time you're in a state ! - It's just a mask. Hurry up, he's getting cold. - How are you, Tony ? - He's fine. - Put it here. - I've brought you clothes. We'll look at them this evening, OK ? Take care. Wait ! The gas cylinder ? I'll hang on to it. Have a nice day. Bye, Tony. Seeing as you're in trouble... Why don't we work together in the house ? You've done it before. Yes, but I was younger. Now I'm old. I'll make my house available. We'll help each other. I help you and you help me. But I have to be careful with the girls. Take them to your sister's. What's going on ? Hi, Nevia. - You think I didn't hear ? - What did you hear ? The house, the job... We sleep at Auntie's... - Have you lost your mind ? - Nevia ! You're just a kid ! I'm not a kid any more. I live here too. What'll Enza think ? Growing up with this ! Peppe ! Come, come ! - Good morning. - Do Julia's nails somewhere else. What's going on ? Leave the milk and tidy up the bedroom. - Come Peppe, let's talk. - What's up ? Tell me. What happened, Nana ? Talk. He sold part of your batch, to our customers, for less. The problem is the goods never arrived. Now they're after me. Look at this list. - Let's see. - Full of debts. That asshole made money behind my back. Pasquale has always been a shithead. If he was lucid he wouldn't be in this mess. Don't worry about it. - Help me. - I'll handle it. Aside from storing the goods, are you willing to sell ? But I have the kids. - The customers come here. - I have responsibilities. - I'll take care of it, I'll be here. - Are you sure ? Take it easy, OK ? OK, Peppe. - I have to go now. - I'll see you out. Yes, they're all there. Perfect. I'll wash it, iron it, and you can make some money. And this ? It's OK, just needs a rinse. My goodness, what's this ? This has to be disinfected, not washed ! It's all ruined, but I'll dye it and make it new again, no worries. And this ? What's this ? Look how beautiful this dress is. Just like one I saw in a fashion magazine. It's perfect for your birthday ! What would I do with that ? I wouldn't wear that. - What are you going to wear ? - The clothes I have. What a pity ! If you like it so much, why don't you wear it ? Enza, what do you think ? Well, yeah... She's scary anyway... Imagine in this dress ! I have to teach you both some manners. Come on, Auntie ! What about that foil on your head this morning ? It was a hair mask. - It didn't change anything ? - It was a mask, not a colour. When I dye my hair you'll see the difference. Come on... Make up this bed. It's late, time for bed. Move, I have to make the bed. Why are we forced to sleep here ? Grandma's busy. Put your pajamas on. - Hey, Nevia. - Hi. - Your grandma inside ? - Yes, she's home. - Hi, Nevia. - Hi. - Dad ! You have to knock. - At my place I have to knock ? There are women inside, be discreet. - Let's be polite. - Yes, my lord. Hey, Pe', no need to knock. Come in. - Hi, Salvatore. - Good morning, Nana. So, any news ? I got someone to take this batch. - When will they pay ? - Don't worry. We'll pay everyone. Another truckload is coming. I'll put the goods in the usual place. The situation isn't good, last week Maria's place was searched. - She is under house arrest. - That's good they've already been. Don't worry, it's under control. Salvatore, get the stuff in the hole and put it you know where. Take Salvatore. - Grandma... - Come on. - Where is it, Nevia ? - Here. Get it. - All here. - Hurry up. Let's go. No, it's not possible, you tricked me. You tricked me ! Leave me ! Leave me ! Leave me ! I'll break your face ! Shithead ! I kill you ! - What's up ? - Salvatore, leave me ! - Enough ! - Let me go ! - What happened ? - I lost your marble ! What's the problem ? Here. Go get all the marbles you want. Thank you, Salvatore. Mari' ! Come ! What did you do to calm her down so quickly ? Nothing, don't worry. Let's go ! - Bye, Salvatore. - Nevia, wait. Come here. - What are all these shoes ? - They're mine. Here. Take these. Size 38 and 39, take them home. No, we don't need them. If they don't fit give them to your grandma. All right, then. Tonight there's the opening of the bar. Wanna come ? Salvatore, you never give up ! I like you ! What am I gonna do ? Take care, bye. Sooner or later you'll say yes. Is your father staying here ? No, I'll run some errands then pick him up. - OK. Bye. - Bye. Crazy prices ! Big brands ! Hey, Flora. Little one, hello. - Are you well ? - What have you got this morning ? I'll show you. Look here, it's beautiful. Yeah, but I can give you 10 euros for it all. 10 ? Just this is worth 10, it's new. Business isn't good these days. When will I sell it ? There are two pairs of shoes too. They're real brands. Only if you're interested, if not I'm going to the shoe stall. I'm interested. Come on, let me see. Are they real ? Or are they fake ? They're real. Look, there's even the price. All right then. What you wanna do ? I can give you 40 total. - I'm feeling generous today. - OK ! - Adua. - What, mum ? Give me 40, please. Listen, Flora. - I'll take this too. - Here, mum ! This jacket too ? For 40 ? All inclusive. All right then. Today I'll send you away happy. Thank you, Flora. - Have a nice day, little one. - You too. - Bye, Adua. - Bye. Listen up ladies ! I'm leaving for real now. Last pieces ! - What're you doing, Grandma ? - What's up ? I have to tell you ... I'm busy tonight. Enza's gone to sleep at Auntie's. You go too. - Where did you get this jacket ? - I bought it. What are you doing with her ? Look at the state of her ! What's up ? An interrogation ? It's none of your business. OK, I get it. - What's this bag ? - Shopping. Here ! I'll bring money home. There's no need for all this fuss. - Where did you get this money ? - I earned it. I sold the shoes that Salvatore gave me. You were wrong. Gifts shouldn't be sold. I saw how Salvatore looks at you. He's a good catch. I don't need anyone. Get the wine and put it on the table. Good evening, I'm Nana. Come in. Have a seat. Good evening. - Pleased to meet you. Dorì. - Antonio. For me ? Beautiful ! Dorì, get the glasses. - Who's this girl ? - My granddaughter. - Does she work here ? - No. - How old is she ? - 17. - Nevia, you finished here ? - Yes. Get your pajamas and go to Auntie's. Come here. What's up, Ju ? Fucking thing doesn't work. Turn off the light. Does the fluorescent effect work ? Goodness Ju, aren't you ashamed ? What's wrong ? One thing I asked you. - The effect works. - Thanks. - Mister, the alien is ready. - Thanks. That's your room. Nevia, the circus ! Take me ! Enza, what do you want with a circus ? Just to see it. Please ! OK, let's see. We've come for nothing. It's closed. Let's go anyway. What ? Enza, where you going ? Be careful. Look how big these shoes are ! For a giant ? It's true ! He's beautiful. You're beautiful. Enza ! Enza, where are you ? Have you lost your mind ? What are you doing ? Shut up and see if anyone comes. - Enza, hurry up ! - It's heavy ! You wanted it. Hurry up ! Whoa, it's heavy ! Hi, I'm back. Hi, Auntie. Always with that phone in your hand ! - What are you doing ? Playing ? - No. - What's that toy ? - It's not a toy. - It's a real animal. - A real animal ? - It's called iguana. - And what's an iguana ? Read. It's a harmless animal. I don't give a damn ! Where's Tonino ? - Auntie, he's there, eating. - He ate Tonino ? He didn't eat Tonino ! He's eating ! I don't want this thing, take it away ! Now ! It's my fault, not hers. Nevia had nothing to do with this ! Shut up and go inside ! - What happened Nana ? - You know nothing ? Come here ! I'm so sorry. Excuse me. My granddaughters are wild. You need a hundred eyes to watch them ! So you're stealing now ? It's a miracle they haven't reported us. Lady, it's OK. - Nana, who are these gentlemen ? - They own the iguana. Good morning. You found it on the street ? You're making us look bad. They didn't mean to steal it. They're young. She liked the iguana. What's wrong ? You knew ? Everyone knew except me ! Don't worry. What matters is he's fine. - He's obviously fine. - I'm sorry. If you want to visit, you know where we are. Ask for Guido. That's me. - Do you like the circus ? - Yes, of course. - I'll leave you tickets. - Thanks. - It's a good show, we'll expect you. - Thanks. Goodbye. How nice ! They even gave us tickets. Nevia, we need to talk. You messed up big. Come here. Auntie, can I ask you something ? Of course. Why don't you have your own family ? Why don't I have a family ? Because I'm ugly. Who would have me ? What's the difference between being a whore, or being with someone you don't love ? I don't understand. Little one, it's the same thing, being with a hundred or only with one. What difference does it make ? Being a whore is a job. Money is the only thing that matters. I don't understand what you wanna know. How can you save yourself here ? Being born female here is bad luck. Don't think about it now. I've got an idea. Move over, let me in. My feet are freezing here. Come on. Come here. Shove over a little more. "Why didn't you make a family ?" What a question ! Come on, Auntie, you're teasing me ! What a great show, huh ? Nevia ! What's up ? You know what I saw ? There were jugglers, animals, even a trapeze artist. - What ? - A trapeze artist ! Nevia, you missed a wonderful show ! - Did you have fun at least ? - Yes. - Come on inside, little one. - Go. I'll finish here, then I'll come. - Umberto, I'll finish up now. - You'll close up ? See you tomorrow. - Yes. Good night. - Night. Here at 17 you're already married with kids. Salvatore has a good head on his shoulders, he has many friends. He can help you find government housing. He opened the bar too, he has a job, he can give her a future. Of course I'd be happy, but she's still a kid. I've talked to her, she doesn't want to know anything about it. Maybe Salvatore will win her over. - Sure he will. - Let's hope. - Salvatore is a knucklehead. - So is she. Let's take it easy. You can come to sell popcorn perhaps. I don't wanna sell popcorn. I want real work. What work would you do ? You're little. We always need help with the animals. That's hard work too. Show me what to do and I'll do it. Come with me. Altin, leave the barrow and come with us. He's Altin. - What's your name ? - Nevia. Hi, Grandma ! How are things ? Where were you all day ? - I was busy. - You were busy ? What ? - I was looking for a job. - Where ? Grandma, don't say anything else. We'll speak tomorrow. What's this stink ? What stink ? You're becoming like Auntie Lucy. Come on ! - Who is it ? - It's me. - What's up ? - What's on your head ? - I'm doing curls. - With clothes pegs ? - I see. Where's Tonino ? - He's sleeping. What's up ? Nothing, I need a favour. Enza has school. Can you take her this week ? Yes, but why ? - I found a good job. - What ? - I'll explain later, I have to go. - OK ! Please, she always finds excuses not to go. Don't worry. - I love you. - Me too. What's wrong ? It's gone off. Next time put it in my fridge, in the caravan. No thanks. Don't worry. - How's work ? - Good. - I like it very much. - I'm glad. - Come for lunch at my brother's. - I'm fine, thanks. No, starlet, come with me. If you don't eat, you won't have the strength to work. - Hello, everyone ! - Hello ! - Hi, Uncle ! - Hi. - How are you ? - Fine. - She's my sister. - Hi, I'm Lizbeth. She sleeps on nails. No, she's a fakir. She's Ambra, my niece. She'll be great at trapeze. Remember my brother Marcus ? The iguana tamer. There's mom, the queen of our circus. Nice to meet you, honey. You've already eaten. - Is there anything left for us ? - Yes, I'll get it now. Nevia, come sit over here. - Come on, get in. - What ? Get on, jump in. Ambra knows this. Ready ? Pippo ! You want it ? Come on ! Don't let me eat alone. Come on ! Open ! Open this mouth for me. Yes, good boy. Come on. Good boy. Why are you putting them outside ? Don't we need air to live ? For costumes it's the same thing. To me they're alive, my fellow travellers. I put them outside to get fresh air. - I see you like animals very much. - Very much. But why you do these odd jobs ? You don't go to school. School is important ! Without school you have no future. - But I want to do it differently. - How ? I wanna travel, discover the world. I want to know everything. How old are you ? 16, 17 ? No ! I'm almost 18. I see. When ? - Soon. - Really ? You need to hurry up to find your future. I'm trying. Let's get the other costumes. Go, go ! - What are you doing here ? - I'm playing with your sis. - And what's that ? - Salvatore brought it. - Hi, by the way. - Hi. Good evening. Hi, Nevia, are you well ? What's up ? Nothing. - What's that stink ? - You smell it too ? Grandma, I'm working at the circus. I'm handling animals. You work at the circus ? You always do what you want. It's a good job. Besides, they're good people. Don't dare go there or I'll lose my job. The stink of animals is better than that of certain people. When'll you teach her to talk ? She has a big mouth ! How cheeky ! Go away ! Do we have to sleep at Auntie's again ? Yes, go. - You finished ? - Wait, let me finish this match. - Are you pissed off ? - Mind your business ! - 4 or 7 you'll sell 'em anyway. - I don't have money for the others. Don't worry, how much have you got ? - I think 2,000. - Give me 2,000 and tomorrow 200. No, no, we'll do this... Take 2,000 and we're done. If that's what you want... We're even. Take care Nana. - Bye Peppe. - Take care. Salvatore, come here. Back in a sec, little one. - What's up ? - Let's do the math here. Nana, get the list. - How much should it be ? - 2,000. Let's go to Auntie's. What have you done ? You're crazy ! Shut up, it's none of your business. I don't get you. Enjoy your lunch. Altin, I've finished. Leave the barrow and go eat. - Where's Guido ? - They're rehearsing inside. OK, see you later. Ladies and gentlemen ! A poem. Once upon a day, at night. Night ! The moon shone throughout the land. Land ! The sun with his burning beams warmed the earth. Earth ! - What happened ? - I've broken the saucer. - How ? - It's all broken. Be careful. Nevia, do me a favour. Sure, what ? Go to my caravan, get a saucer like this and come back to the chapiteau. Chapiteau ? What's that ? Come on, starlet... The chapiteau, the circus tent. OK. There you are ! Got them ? Do you remember the act we were rehearsing ? The one of the poet. I've seen it many times. - Try it with us. - She'll perform with us ? Yes ! Come with me. Come. Don't worry, you can do it. Here. It's important to get props ready. The napkin. Take it like that. Like that. On your arm. Pull here to unroll it. - From here. - Perfect. Glass... And you're ready. Ladies and Gentlemen ! - A poem. - Poem ! Once upon a day, at night. Night ! The moon shone throughout the land. Land ! I'll bring these to the caravan. See you at dinner. Bye. Thanks. Starlet, leave those and help me with the bench. - You did really well. - Thanks. We'll work on it. Can I ask you something ? I saw bags and tubes in your caravan. What are they ? My things. There were also medicines. They're my things ! Were you poking around ? You sent me for the saucer... Don't worry ! Don't bother with my business ! Do what I say ! Mind the animals and don't interfere with my life ! Nevia, wake up. - What do you want ? - We have to go to the circus. - What time is it ? - I don't know. Enza, it's early. Why did you wake me up ? Come on, please. I love you. Stop trying to butter me up. What's going on ? Let me sleep. You woke up Grandma. Get up. Help ! - Bigger push ! - No ! My head is spinning. - My head is spinning. - Big push ! See how beautiful you are ? OK, starlet... I'm going to work. - You're with animals too ? - Yes, I always feed them. Come with me. Come. Enza look, this is the splits. And this is the cartwheel. Do you like it ? Come on ! Catch ! Yummy ! - Go, Enza ! - What are you doing ? Look at what a mess you made ! Where did you get this beautiful dress ? I lent it to her. Come on, we have to go. Just a few more minutes ! I have to get changed. All right. I'll be back, but hurry up. OK. That's great ! Eat ! What the fuck are you doing here ? - The door was closed. Get out. - What's that ? Get out ! - What's that ? - I said you can't be here. You have to get out ! If I say go, you have to leave ! Do you understand ? Go ! - Let me see. - Go away ! And don't come back anymore ! Go away ! Get out ! Do you understand ? Back at this time with Enza ? You had me worried. That's enough of this crap ! I make the rules now ! You go to bed. Where you going ? Aren't you ashamed of this life ? Cleaning up animals' shit ! - Forget it. It's over. - What's over ? - You have to consider Salvatore. - Salvatore ? I don't wanna end up like you ! I'm leaving. And I'm taking Enza too. At least we'll save ourselves. I'm your grandma, I decide what you can and can't do. "Your grandma" ? A grandmother protects her grandkids, she defends them. And what you do ? You just bring men home ! You wanna sell me too ? Why don't you worry about your son ? That criminal who's in jail. Didn't have the balls to do anything, not even be a father for Enza. He was never around. Where was he while Mum was dying ? And you come here as a grandmother ? Have you ever asked me how I am ? Have you ever asked me ? When I miss Mum... Well, next time, before you speak, search your conscience. Good morning. - Nevia, what happened to your hair ? - What ? What have you done, Grandma ? Nana, you did this ? What have you done ? They're coming here. Take the children and leave. You know they can't be with me. Send them to Salvatore's. Wake up Enza and leave. Look for Peppe and Salvatore. And you ? I don't want to leave you. - Police, open up ! - Go, go. Who is it ? - Open the door ! - What do you want ? Let's play for time so they can get away. Enza, wake up, we gotta go. - What's happening ? - Hurry up, we have to run ! What do you want ? Be careful. Hurry up. The police came, they took Grandma, I don't know if they arrested her. - She said to come here. - Calm down. I'll take you to my house. Come with me. Let's go. You wanna tell me what you did to your hair ? My hair is the least of our problems. We have to figure out what to do. Call your father. I have to know what happened to Grandma. I'll call Dad. Don't worry. Now you're with me, I'll take care of you. Do this now, get some sleep next to your sister. I'll go, call Dad and buy some clothes, you can't stay like this. Go. I'll wait here. Call your dad. - Hey, Auntie. - Sweetie ! Come on, hurry up. - How are you ? - Fine and you ? - Hi Auntie. - Hi, little one. - How are you ? - Fine. Look what I brought. Go study. - And Grandma ? - Don't worry, she's fine. Come on, we have to talk. It's nice here ! You OK ? Nice ? I don't wanna be here. Why can't we stay with you ? Little one... I'm nothing to you legally. If they find you, Social Services will take you. Do we really have to stay here ? Enza has school. What'll we do ? Don't worry, I can handle the school. I'll say she's sick. She has to stay here. And for everything else there's Peppe. Have you seen Grandma ? Have you heard anything ? No. Peppe said he'll take care of everything. - Are you sure ? - Of course I'm sure. Here are your clothes. Thank you, Auntie. What happened to Julia ? Was she arrested ? No. She ran off like a cat. She's staying with Dorì now. Listen to me. Let time pass, you'll see that everything will be OK. - Did anyone come looking for me ? - No, who would ? - The circus guys. - No one came. Are you sure ? Little one, they're nomadic. You can't go to the camp, get it ? I almost forgot. I brought your backpack. Auntie, come. I want to show you our room. - Yes. Is it nice ? - Come ! Let's see this room. - What's up ? - Nothing. Let's go, Enza. "Dark moon, I hug you gently, stars blaze and my heart beats to its limit." What are you saying ? Here it says something else. "Moon song, you bring me luck. Among owls and bats, among pixies with umbrellas, I'll find my way on paths I don't know." - What did you make up ? - Come on, it doesn't matter. Besides, I don't like songs. This was my poem. You didn't wanna go to school, now you're a poet ? Listen to her ! All right then, it doesn't matter. I'll say that ! - Salvatore, what do you want ? - Come with me. Come. - What's that ? - I made you breakfast. Seriously ? C'mon. Wait here, I'll be right back. Happy birthday, princess ! What's this childish thing ? Don't you like it ? You haven't opened it yet ! This is the dress for tonight. I've organized an amazing party. You're only 18 once and you'll be the most beautiful of all. Thank you, Salvatore. Okay then. I'm going to work. Don't be late. See you at the bar. Apply this colour on the external corner of the eye. Tapping it on. Then go up to the fold of the eyelid... Apply it on the fold of the eyelid. Then here, near the internal corner of the eye. What are you doing in the toilet for three hours ? - Wait a minute, I'm coming. - I have to pee, hurry up. Oh my God ! You're beautiful. Happy birthday, princess ! Happy birthday, Nevia ! - Anything else ? - No, thank you. Nevia, come and whip the cream. - Do you want these phones ? - It depends on what they cost. Thanks. - Give me 600 euros. - No, 400. Luciano, give me 500 and we're good. - And the guarantee ? - You have my word. - What you think ? Good ? - Let's take 'em. Get the phones, little one. - Here. - Thanks. - They're good. - A good deal. - Luciano, see you. - We'll go now. Goodbye. - Bye, little girl. - Bye. See ? This is how you do business. Count it. Nevia ! What are you doing ? - We're leaving. - Where are you going ? - I don't wanna stay here. - But why ? I saw you with Enza back there. She told me all the shady stuff you made her do. Is that normal for you ? Aren't you ashamed ? What are you trying to say ? She can't become a criminal like you, she's a child. Did you think you could buy me with a party ? I worked for you, and as I worked for you, I can work somewhere else. - So I'm a criminal after all ? - You've always been. This is why I like you, Nevia. Now that's enough. Do you understand ? - What the hell you doing ? - You'll stay here. - You must do as I say ! - What are you doing ? - Stay out of it. - Don't touch her ! - Come here ! - What are you doing ? - Leave Nevia alone ! - You get out ! - Leave her alone ! - Get out ! Leave her alone ! Let's go ! Hurry up ! Hurry up ! Let's go ! Auntie ! - Who is it ? - It's me, open up ! - What are you doing here ? - I'm in trouble. Let us in. Get in. Take this phone, so I'll always know where you are. When you're in Rome, call my cousin. Thank you, auntie. - Here, this is for grandma. - Where did you get this money ? I found it on the ground near Salvatore. Get a good lawyer. They're shitty people, don't trust them. Be careful, if they come after you, stay out of trouble. - Why don't you come with us ? - I have to take care of Grandma. Then I'll join you. Come on, it's late. Goodbye, Tony. - Goodbye, Auntie. - Bye. Can you let us out, please ? No, I can't stop. Sir, please, do us this favour, let us out here. NEVIA
