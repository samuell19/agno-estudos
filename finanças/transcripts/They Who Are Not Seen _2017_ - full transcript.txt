My name is Saraswati. I am 24 years old. I am a psychologist. I can see those... ...which all of you usually call spirits... ...ghosts, demons or whatever... ...and this is my story. Grandma? You decided not to go? Isn't this the year I've to send Saras to school? Yes, you provide the money. You provide the money, Ron! What do you mean by that? You want to relinquish your responsibility... ...as Laras and Saras's father? Ouch! Hello? Ron? Ron? Quiet! Saras? What are you doing here? Saras, isn't this Grandma's necklace? Why did you take it out of the cupboard? Grandma is sad because Grandma doesn't like the necklace... ...you put on her this morning... ...for Grandma to sleep in the box. Grandma is in Heaven, okay? She isn't going to come back again. Come on, I've prepared the food. I don't want to. I still want to be here with Grandma! Saras, Grandma has passed away, alright? She's not here. Come on, let's eat. Grandma hasn't passed away. To prove it, Grandma is behind you, Mum. Come on, let's eat. Grandma was the first ghost figure I saw. But at the time... ...I didn't understand the meaning of life and death. I didn't know that we would never again see... ...our loved ones forever. As I got older... ...my world became increasingly narrow. Every time I blinked my eyes, they were increasing. You saw them again, right? Enough of that. Let's go. Adit was the only person who understood me. Change this to this. Oh, this has been crossed out. Oh, yes! Mum, have to pay for the school fees tomorrow. Mum? Yes, I heard. Hold on, alright? Once the order that day has been paid. It's not a problem if it's a few days late, right? Laras! Didn't I tell not to play there? Now everything is scattered everywhere. Take her. Take her over there. That, that. Where are you going? I accidentally left my book. I have an exam tomorrow. I'm going now, alright? Saras, I want to come along. Incidentally, I haven't locked up all the classes. Mister, thank you, alright? You're welcome. Child... ...do you want to sleep with me? Saras? Help us. Go away. Don't follow me. Don't bother me. Go away! What's the matter with you? Mum, them. They refuse to go away, Mum. Please make them go away. It's nighttime. Quickly go to sleep. Mum never knew what I experienced. Even if I told the truth... ...she wouldn't believe it. Go away! Don't bother me! Go away! Don't bother me! Go away! Gosh! Go away! Help us. Go away! You have to help us. All of you go away from here! Help us. Go away! I needed time to get used to... ...seeing spirits seeking my help... ...and jinns just annoying me. Saras. Saras. Saras, I'm going to go to Madam's house, alright? I want to send these orders. Saras? Saras?! Yes, Mum? Saras, are you listening or not to me talking to you? Saras. Saras. Adit? What are you doing here? There's something odd. Adit? Exponential operations and root operations... ...because logarithm is closely linked with... After I went to Adit's house, it turns out the house was empty. Neighbours said Adit and his family were staying in Bandung... ...and hadn't returned. I plucked up courage to... ...go to Adit's house in Bandung all by myself. Excuse me. Mum, you said all their money was here. Where, Mum? It's true, Son. I saw them put the money in that cupboard. Adit, help! Adit! Mum? Be quiet. Don't make noise. Please be quiet. Adit, help! Gita?! Adit? Adit! Adit? Adit! Adit! Dul? Don't! Don't, Dul! Dul! Abdul! Adit! Adit! Adit! Dul, make a tea. Quick. I came here to see Adit. Where is Adit? Who are you, Madam? I'm the maid here... ...and Adit... Adit has passed away, Miss. That night, the Master and the Mistress... ...were not home. My son and I were sleeping. A thief came into the house. The thief killed both the children, Miss. Sorry, miss. Hold on, alright? Madam, eat, alright? Abdul and Mrs Sumi... ...have worked for my family... ...since I was small. I really didn't expect... ...that they would be the cause of all this. Sumi! Yes, Madam? Come here, Sweetheart. I'm going, alright? Yes, Madam. I considered... ...Mrs Sumi like my own mother. Mum has returned. Adit, Dul, quickly do it again. Saras, thank you. Even the closest person... ...can make us a victim without us knowing... ...because humans can become creatures... ...scarier than other creatures. Murderer! At that moment, it was the first time... ...I lost a very close person in my life... ...and there I learned... ...we must go through every day... ...like there was no tomorrow. As time went by... ...my sensitivity continued to grow. Besides seeing creepy spirits... ...it turns out I've two friends who... ...are just as creepy. We've been friends for quite a long time. They know my ability... ...and they have no problem with it. I want to tell good news... ...for all of us. What is it? Wow! New! Good, right? Look at this. What is here? Try, try. Try take our picture. Try take our picture. A bit higher. Why doesn't it fit in the screen, Yova? Saras! You're just too honest. I'm so hungry. Sis, Bro, the Bakso is taking so long. Come on, hurry up. I'm already hungry. Be patient. It's coming now. It's here. Yes, I'm hungry. The one that's a lot is mine. This one is mine. Hot. Delicious. Now it's enough. At that time, I just realised... ...evidently many people utilize supernatural beings... ...to popularize their business. Saras, why aren't you eating? This Bakso is delicious. Try it. Hold on, alright? Yes. Hungry? Hey, let's go. Hurry up, let's go. Why? This Bakso has pork in it, is it? Enough. Don't ask too many questions. Mum, could you buy me... ...a new handphone? This one constantly hangs. Only hangs, right? Not wrecked. You do know that we don't have enough money? Yes, alright. Is it alright if I borrow it first? How are you going to pay for it? You still don't understand. Didn't I ask nicely? If you can't buy a new handphone... ...fine, never mind. Jelangkung, Jelangsat, there's a party here... ...a small party. Came without invitation, return without an escort. Why is it still not moving? Well? Try again, okay? Yes, alright. Jelangkung, Jelangsat, there's a party here... ...a small party. Came without invitation... ...return without an escort. Laras, what are you doing? Playing Jelangkung, Saras. They have all come. So, what are you planning to do now? Saras... Saras? Saras? Saras. Mum! Mum! Saras? What's wrong with Saras? Mum. Naughty children. You kept calling us. We have come now. What do you want? Saras... Saras? Saras? Saras? Saras? Saras? Child, come on. Eat. It's alright. It's nice. It's alright. Come on. Eat! Saras! Your sister isn't here now. Saras? Laras? Saras? Let go! I've said it! She is not here. Come on, eat it. Saras? Grandma? Saras... ...you have to fight her. You must return to your body. But I still want to be with you, Grandma. I'm always watching you, Saras. What's wrong with you? Hey, let go. Let her go! Saras? You have to return to your body. You must fight her. Saras? Saras? Saras? What have you guys done? Saras? Laras? Wake up, Saras. Laras? Saras? Saras? Even if she wants something... ...there's no need to resort to this for attention. The reaction you saw was a psychological reaction. It is called dissociation reaction. That's a reaction that can make... ...people lose their faculty with the reality around them. That happens because of physical stress... ...as well as mental stress and this reaction gives a chance... ...to express what has been buried all this time. It can come out through screams, shouts... ...dancing, as if hypnotizing yourself. Physically, yes, it's very tiring. But mentally, it's very satisfying. What can be done? I don't know what to do. You want an honest answer from me as an older sister... ...or as a psychologist? A psychologist. Okay, as a psychologist, you must be able to make... ...Saras feel comfortable with herself in front of you. Lidya, she is a teenager. As an older sister... ...I know you're scared a repetition of... ...what had happened to Rita. But Rita didn't die because of you. No. Saras will not become like Rita. This is your task, alright? You heal her. Lidya... ...she does not need a psychologist. All she needs is just the presence of a mother. Everything will be fine. Sorry, Saras. It's not your fault. But next time don't play Jelangkung, alright? Just play with Barbie. Who used to love eating pancakes? When she was small, Grandma always made it for her. Thank you, Auntie. It's been a while since I ate pancakes. Do you want some, Laras? No need, Auntie. I prefer this. Okay. Lidya? No. Saras... ...isn't your handphone wrecked? This is to buy a new handphone. No need, Mum. You just keep the money. Anyway, that amount of money is not enough... ...to buy the handphone I want. Auntie Rima is here, it'll be topped up. Share. Forget it, it's alright. How was your exam that day? Could you do it? Yes, I could, Auntie. Sure? Look at this. Oh, Irina. Your new handphone? It's so cool. Thank you. But my dad bought the wrong one. That's not the one I wanted. So, forget it. Just bought the wrong one... ...and it's this cool? What kind do you want? Isn't this cool? We'd like to buy hair bands. Someone asked us to get it. This one is good. This. This. Mana of my friends bought it. Any better than this? Come on, try this one. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Come again, alright? Morning demand! May we be successful! In demand, sweet. Sweet. Laras, call your sister. The food is ready. Saras, dinner is ready. Do you want to come and play with me or not? Mum! Mum! Saras? Who are you? A Westerner, right? What's this? Saras? Are these vegetables? Mum, Saras is possessed again. I don't like it! I hate it! I don't like vegetables. Saras? Saras? Saras? I don't like vegetables. Stop, stop, stop. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop, Saras. Saras? I want to go back! Saras? Saras? Why are you making a fool of me? Lidya, let it be. Saras? Lidya, be quiet. Saras? Lidya, Lidya. Stop. Stop it! Are you listening? Lidya, Lidya. Lidya! Stop it! Lidya! Saras?! Saras? Saras? Lidya. Saras? Saras? Wake up. You must accept... ...Saras's abilities. This talent has been in our family for generations. Mum? Saras? Saras? Saras? Saras? When I was young... ...I believed all the fairy tales... ...mum told as though they were real stories. But now... ...all my real stories are considered fairy tales by my mum. Guys. Guys, look at that. That. Faiz and Dewi are very affectionate, right? You're beautiful, right? What are you saying? To you, am I beautiful or not? That means Faiz is a homosexual. You always say whatever you like. He never looks at another girl besides Dewi... ...even though Dewi's face is just Soso. He really hasn't looked at another girl before? Actually, there is a jinn blocking Faiz's eyes. That's why Faiz only sees Dewi. So, that jinn is making Faiz blind? Hold on, alright? Yes. Laras! Yes, Saras? Where did you get the money? Forget it, just take it. Saras, thank you, alright? Someone's inside. I swear I'll never enter the this school's toilet again! But what if it appears in all the toilets in this school? I'll look for a toilet outside, at Internet cafes, coffee shops. Wherever. I don't know anymore. It must be the ghost who committed suicide because of being bullied. Isn't that ghost a famous legend? Legendary ghost? Yes. I know you can feel my presence. Sorry, I just want to ask for help. My name is Dinda. Saras, have you found the book yet? I think you guys go on first. Of course, someone wants to unburden themselves again, right? Hey, handsome or not? Beautiful? Who?Genderowo? Vampire? Green in colour? Hobgoblin?Kelong Wewe? This is the one we talked about earlier today. The ghost in the toilet? So, where is the ghost now? Behind you. Behind you, Irina. It must be holding you. Why do I suddenly feel like peeing? Accompany me. Just let the ghost accompany you. Isn't it a girl? Gosh! You're not funny at all. Enough, come on. I need to pee. Come with me to the toilet. Laras, I'll accompany her, okay? Yes. Where were we just now? My mum is the only thing I have. She gave all the best for me. Became my faithful friend. Made my favourite breakfast every morning. Watched television together. Happy birthday to you... ...happy birthday to you... ...happy birthday to you... ...wishing you a long life. Make a wish first before blowing the candles. Come on. Hurray. Now hold it first. I have something. What's that, Mum? Wow! It's beautiful. Mum's love was everything to me. But... ...my life at school seemed... ...contrary to my happiness at home. Citra was a popular student in school. Everyone wanted to be Citra's friend. I wanted to be just like Citra. I did everything it took to be just like them. I wanted to be seen as one of them. I didn't mind doing their homework. I didn't mind serving them. Didn't I order orange juice? Why am I getting avocado juice? But you said... I did not mind. Mum never failed to make me feel calm. One day, Citra informed... ...that I had passed the test... ...to join their group. Dinda, congratulations. You're now one of us. You're happy, right? Very happy, Citra. So sweet. Congratulations, Dinda. I got everything I ever wanted at that moment. Where are you going this late at night? Sleeping over at Citra's house. Citra? Aren't you constantly telling me that they... Not anymore, Mum. I'm going now, alright? Hey, Dinda. Dinda, no need. You may not go. Mum, don't you want me to have friends? Do you want me to always be alone? Are you afraid that if I have friends... ...you won't have much time with me anymore? Dinda, I just don't want you to cry anymore. Mum, I've grown up. I know what I need to do. How about if we took a picture with this new camera? I want. I want. There you go! Thank you, Dinda. There you go! Now Miss Dinda will be posing! Take off your clothes. Hurry up. I'm shy, Citra. Dinda, this is just between you and us. Don't you trust us? Yes, but I'm shy, Citra. Dinda, haven't you now become... ...a member of our group? Right. You don't have to be shy, alright? Just take off your clothes, alright? Okay? We can help you, alright? Yes. Take off your clothes, alright? One, two, three! You still wear that kind of bra? But it's so cute! Let's pose. Come on, pose. One, two, three! Finally, I reaped my hard work. I prepared for my big day. I had become a part of Citra's gang. I was wrong. They trapped me. This room became the place I hid from them... ...and the place where I breathed my last. I left mum. Mum was drowning in sorrow. Laughter was no longer heard when the television was showing... ...our favourite programme. Mum just left everything as it was... ...since the last time I was at home. Mum did not want to change anything. Excuse me, Madam. Excuse me, Madam. Good afternoon, Madam. Good afternoon, Child. My name is Saras. I would like to ask something... ...about your child... I'm busy. Earrings. The earrings you gave... ...are still in Dinda's wardrobe. I met Dinda, Madam. Dinda told me everything. Please have a drink. Yes, thank you. So, you're with the yearbook committee? Oh, yes. I'm collecting alumni testimonials. First question. How was it in school... ...being the most popular student? Even I don't understand why. Each ExCo used to ask me to become one of their members. When in fact, I couldn't take too many, right? In essence, I used to have so many fans. Everyone wanted to be my friend. Not just boys. There were quite a number of girls too... ...who wanted to be friends with me. Including one by the name of Dinda? Do you know Dinda? Mum. Saras. Your watch isn't damaged, right? Let's eat. Have you done your homework? I have, Mum. Tomorrow after tuition, come home straight. 3:00 o'clock, alright? But mum, tomorrow I... Saras, don't keep wandering around. Tomorrow I've to do something. What do you need to do? Aren't you a student? Your job is to study. What do you guys want coming here? You will not be able to return my daughter. Auntie... Go away! Go away! Go away! Madam, Citra came here to ask for forgiveness. What do you know? This is Dinda's wish. Dinda told me... Enough. Go away. Go away! Go away. She told me about... ...the Hello Kitty Fried Rice which you cooked for her... ...every morning and watching comedy shows... ...every Sunday... ...and the last puzzle with a picture of a castle... ...which has never been finished till now. Mum. Dinda? I am happy... ...having a mother... ...like you, Mum. Forgive me, Dinda. I could not understand... ...what you were facing at the time. I feel I've failed. Mum... ...not even a little bit... ...in my mind... ...to leave you all alone. You have taken care of me since small... ...teaching me many things... ...to be a strong person... ...and someone who works hard like you. You taught me patience. I wanted to grow up, to be like you, Mum. What happened to me... ...was an accident. It wasn't anyone's fault. Mum... ...I love you. Auntie Dayu, please forgive me. It needs a strong person... ...to ask for forgiveness... ...and a person who is stronger... ...to forgive. What's wrong with you? So noisy. Can't be quiet. Nothing's wrong. Are we serious about watching a horror movie? Don't want another movie? You're such a coward. Are you watching a horror movie alone? Saras and I are here, right? What can be seen are only the three of us. What can't be seen... ...are many. I don't like you when you're like this. I don't like your ways. Hold on, alright? Hold on. Saras? Saras? Saras, Saras, what is it? It's nothing. Guys, later when I go home... ...my potential boyfriend will pick me up... ...that's okay, right? I think you shouldn't go out with him tonight. Why? I've got a strange feeling. Saras, seldom there's someone who wants to be with Irina. Make her happy once in a while, isn't a problem. Okay, okay. Saras? Hello, Saras. Where are you now? Are you alright? Yes, I'm still with Dewi in the car but... ...already on the way home. Gosh! Yes, alright. Yes, alright. Yes, alright. If so, have fun, okay? Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. At the time, I felt that moment was... ...the phase of my metamorphosis. New capabilities within me... ...lowly manifesting itself. Beginning of a nightmare. What else is wrong with this car? Dewi, what is it? Hold on, alright? I'll call my driver first. Hello? Yono, come... ...to the T.B. Simatupang flyover, alright? Yes, bring the motorcycle. Don't take too long, Yono. I'll be waiting, alright? Hello. Hello, Saras. Call back later. I'm in a frazzle. Where are you? Gosh! Laras, I'm on a motorcycle. You're on a motorcycle? But it's almost close... ...to my residential complex. Already on the bridge. Yes? Okay. Goodbye. Saras? Where are you going this late at night? I've to meet Irina tonight, Mum. Tonight? Can't it wait till tomorrow? No, Mum. This is such an emergency. I must meet Irina tonight... How bad is the emergency? Talking to you will be in vain. You won't believe it. Forget it. What do you mean by saying that? Which part of what I said wasn't clear enough? Go back to your room now! Saras, I know which way to go. Yes, alright. Come on. Hurry. Saras, wait. Saras, I'll come along, alright? I'm bored being at home, Saras. You do know mum won't let me go anywhere? Laras? Laras? Laras, what's wrong with you? Let's stand up. We'll go home, okay? I can't, Saras. My head hurts, Saras. Okay. Okay, you're alright. You're alright. I want to go home, Saras. I want to go home, Saras. I want to go home, Saras. Yes, yes. We'll go home. We'll go home. Hold on, hold on. Let's go home. Yes, we'll go home. Hold on, hold on. I don't want mum to scold me. No, we won't be scolded. We'll go home, we'll go home. Hold on, alright? Please help! Please! Please telephone! I don't know what to do. Please call an ambulance. Please. Laras, don't. Hold on, hold on. Hold on, alright? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on! Please! Okay. Okay. You're alright. Laras? Laras? No! Laras? Please, Laras. No, Laras. Help! Laras, please don't! Laras? Please, Sweetheart. No! Laras? Laras? Laras, wake up. Wake up. Laras? Laras? Please, Laras. No. No. Please. No, Laras. No! Laras, please. Please. Laras, please wake up. You're satisfied? You're satisfied killing your sister? Laras ran away that night... ...together with me... ...because she couldn't stand being under the same roof as you. You're blaming me? How dare you say that to me? I worked myself to the bone to earn money for you. I worked for you! You do not know what I've been through. Because you never tell! You also never wanted to know what we wanted! What is Laras's favourite colour? What is Laras's favourite food? When was the last time you made her smile... ...and you told her that you loved her? This is all your fault, Mum! Hey! Lidya?! Don't call me mum anymore! As of tonight, you are no longer my daughter. I don't care about losing my other daughter tonight. Do you want to know what happened to Auntie Rita? Auntie Rita was born with the same abilities... ...that you have. But unfortunately, she couldn't control it. Auntie Rita was very close to your mother. Auntie Rita always poured out her heart to your mother. Until one day... ...Auntie Rita was found dead, it was suicide. No one knew what was the cause. Your mother was the person who felt the most guilt... ...for all of that. Your mother felt she had failed to protect Auntie Rita... ...and your mother doesn't want... ...that to happen to you. At that moment it was not an easy situation for me. I had lost a sister... ...whom I loved so much... ...and a mother at the same time. I'll be sending Saras now, alright? It has been seven years since the last time... ...I heard my sister laugh. For seven years I've been abroad... ...seeking knowledge... ...and for those seven years too... ...I haven not spoken to my mother. Hello. Nothing much has changed in this house. Just like before I left... ...including mum. Hey, your mum and I have made pancakes. Don't you miss pancakes? Come on in. Come on. I'm more mature in seeing life... ...from two points of view. We can not avoid the fact... ...that we live side by side with... ...those who can not be seen. Do they think they can easily play me a fool? Are you able to forgive them? I don't feel anything... ...when I hurt my pets. I don't know why. Madam, you don't feel any pity for all your pets? All my experiences interacting with the spirits... ...has made me a good listener... ...and able to understand human nature... ...which can not be predicted. It is certainly strange how the universe laid out my life. I am often beaten by my husband... ...but I enjoyed it. Saraswati. Those Who Can Not Be Seen. Hello? Yes. Yes, I'm now looking at the design of the book cover. Yes, in my opinion, it's very good. I'm writing the final chapter now. Once I'm finished, I'll inform you. Yes, okay. Thank you. Hello? Saras, where are you? Still at the usual cafe. When are you coming back? I'll be back soon, Mum. Why? No, it's nothing. Yes, alright then. Okay? Mum. Yes? Forgive me. Yes, alright. You come home quick, alright? Yes, Mum. A bomb has exploded once again in Jakarta... ...in the Kota Tua area at 4:00 o'clock this afternoon. Security forces suspect the perpetrators to be... ...a terrorist network which have repeatedly... ...terrorized the capital. This time... ...their target was a crowded area which... ...has many banks and shops selling coffee. The network is already being sought by police. It has links to the string of explosions... ...which happened in the capital in recent years. A witness who works in a bank... ...around the scene of the incident has stated that... My name is Saraswati. I passed away at the age of 24. I once lived life as a human... ...until the time came for me to leave this world. Our existence here is not to scare you guys. We each have a story... ...and that's my story. Today is 40th day after my death. The last day I can see them. Those who have passed away never leave us. Can not be heard, can not be seen... ...but always together.
