* [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] * * [music] [Man crying] [gunshot] [woman screaming] [woman crying] [Paul] Alright, cut! Armon? [Armon] Perfect. [Paul] Alright Peter, let's do it again. You got two good takes Paul. Max insisted we'd be out of here at 8 o'clock Oh fuck Max. Uh, alright check the gate. [Assistant] Gate's clear. Alright that's a wrap. [Assistant] OK everyone we see each other tomorrow at 6 o'clock, same location. Kathy's on her way with the call sheet so stick around. -Nice job, you're doing great. -Thanks. Takes 2, 5, and 8 right? How long was the last take? 32 seconds. -Just bring 'em home. -Okay Hey, how was I? You're OK Dylan. You're OK. * [Music] OK huh? That cocksucker. [Max] Paul, Paul! You have a minute? You have a minute? Harry, this is Paul Sullivan, our legendary director. Hi, nice to meet you. Paul, this is Harry Koning, Harry so to speak. He's Belgium's most famous T.V. reporter and talk show host. He's doing a special about the movie, he's interviewing everyone around here. -[Harry] Even Max so you can imagine. -[Max Laughs] Harry, you're interviewing the producer? Ah, such a waste of time. [Laughs] Hey... [Max] Ah, Dylan Dylan. T.V. people are here, are you ready for your close-up? Fuck you Max. Oh come on! -Fuck off! -[Max] Come on! Come on! [Dylan] You two bit fucks! Ah, that's Dylan the villain. Great actor, bad attitude. * [Music] Well to be honest, um, I never really heard of the guy but prison wrote these memoirs, uh, come up with these grotesque excuses for every crime he ever committed and somehow justified himself and it sort of fascinated me. [speaking in Flemish] We've seen a lot of movies about serial killers recently in what sense is this one any different. Well first of all I'm directing it. I mean obviously it's a thriller, it's gonna have some action, but essentially it's a study of pure evil. So Max, how did you manage to convince 2 American stars to work on a Belgian film? -Well one needs his class obviously -[Laughs] No it all boils down to the script. But let's be clear, this is not just a Belgian film. It's, um, an English language film, finest out of Hollywood and a series of countries in Europe. Belgium is much too small for Shades. Some people say, Max, that Canadian actress Michelle Miller, who plays the Lebecq's girlfriend in the movie, is also your girlfriend. Believe me, Michelle was talented long before she was my girlfriend. She's a natural. Ms. Miller do you realize that when Paul Sullivan made his first movie that you weren't even born yet? Oh, is he that old? Well, I guess he lied about his age. Lead actor Dylan Cole refused to be interviewed for this program. He doesn't seem to be the easiest guy to work with. Well you know, you can't believe everything you read He's been a professional, he's a really great guy, sometimes he grinds out his character a little too much, gets really deep into it but, you know, he'll be fine. By the way your name is Paul S. Sullivan. What does the S. stand for? The S stands for stupid, the S stands for smart. [Dylan] Smart? Sadistic is more like it you fuck. [reporter speaking in Flemish on T.V.] -* [Music] -[people talking] Hit me again. I want a vodka bit of lemon, tonic, no ice. -[speaking in Flemish] -You got Lemon? Lemon? [Dylan on T.V.] Stop following me you prick. Fuck you! C'mon take off you fucking asshole! Is that you on the television? Uh huh, can I get my drink please? Sonia! Hey, I pay eh? I pay. Thank you. Mike, Crazy Mike. Dylan. Dylan the Villain. I'm Bob. Bob and Dylan, no shit? So you're a... [speaking in Flemish] -Movie star. -Yeah movie star. Hey, you think that makes you any better than us? Better? No. It gets me a lot of free pussy though. [Laughs] [speaking in Flemish] So, so you're playing Freddy Lebecq? No shit. You really look like him. Yeah Mike knows him from jail, they did bodybuilding together. Bodybuilding? -Yeah, the Lebecq he runs the gym in jail. -Gym in jail. What kind of man is he? He was not a bad guy, at least not before he killed those people. You know what they did to him? They put him behind bars for seven eight years for peanuts. [Mike] When he got out, whamo!! [Laughs] We get crazy. Aint you do crazy things sometimes? Well I do. -Yeah, that's why we call him-- -Crazy Mike. -Crazy Mike. -Tell me, you read his book? He talks about me in it. What book? His memoirs. He wrote his memoirs in jail. How he did it, why he did it. I just read the script. Pffft. Bullshit. Read his book. Yeah read the book. Read the book. I hear Lebecq is coming out soon. You better play him right. [Laughs] * [Music] [Girl crying] Don't do this to me. Please. Afraid of this, right? Yes. Yes. Please, no. I'll take everything off. Turn around. Do it. Please, no. I'm sorry. [shotgun blast] That was great. [speaking in French] -Fabulous Paul, you're outdoing yourself. -Thanks Yeah I like it. It's moving, it's exciting. [Dylan] It's cheap and nasty, thats what it is. God dammit Dylan I don't want any actors at the rushes. Cut the crap Fellini, it's my fucking face up there. [Dylan] This whole bullshit with the dress and the tits and the white panties. It's so fucking cheap. What are you talking about? The audience is going to be-- Moved, Max? You think they're gonna be moved? Titillated maybe but they aint gonna be fucking moved. People want a strong story with characters they can sympathize with. [Paul] Dylan, the god damn story's about a mass murderer. Get real alright. Whatever. I think your scene sucks. Oh come on Dylan. You've read the script haven't you? You know what this movie is about no? Yeah I've read the script, but I've also read Lebecq's book. Lebecq's book is a bunch of bullshit. Nothing but lies. Alright you guys. You want exploitation? I'll give you exploitation. Who am I anyway? Only the fucking lead!! [Something breaks] Don't worry about him, I got him under control. Yeah, I sure hope so. Fucking actors. * [Music] [Max] Couldn't you keep him out of here for Christ's sake? Dylan Cole, Max. There's no holding him back. [Max] Cole and his tricks and his mind games. [Max] Don't worry Max I got him under control. I hate this method crap. [Michelle] That reminds me of marathon man. [Max] Which man? [Michelle] Dustin Hoffman in the movie Marathon Man. [Michelle] He kept annoying Laurence Olivier with his method antics and finally Olivier said something like, "My dear boy why don't you try some acting?" [Max] Well, Larry was right, fucking stanislauska shit. [Michelle] Stanislavski, Max. -[Max] Whatever. -[Phone rings] Maximilian Vogel... [speaking in Flemish] -[Max exhales] -[Michelle] What? French fucking co-producers received complains from crew they want a longer lunch break, but more importantly they want wine with their lunch. [Michelle speaking French] European co-production bullshit. French and their wine, English and their high tea, the Americans and their-- And Belgians and their fries, right? [Laughs] [Max] Ah, I know one thing. If this movie works, they'll never see me again around here. Hollywood here I come. -[Laughs] -Max! -Can't you take the stairs? -[curses in Flemish] [Phone ringing] Did Gregory call? No but we got two important faxes from the ministry and presentations for the libel. Oh and something else. Or rather somebody else. Wolfgang Weber. As in counselor Weber? Yep. He's waiting in your office. Katherine, you leave a lawyer alone in my office? Are you out of your mind? No games Max, this is important. [Inaudible speaking] [speaking in Flemish] I'm sticking to it. And I suggest you do the same. [speaking in Flemish] In English please? [Max] This is an international production. I oblige my staff and crew to speak English so if you want to do business with me, speak English. OK. We made deal for low budget Flemish film about suffering of Lebecq's victims and their families. Right? But to me, and to the press, it seems you're doing something completely different. I mean you're making a big American movie, or at least an international production, and therefore, the victims family has got a feeling that their rights are being ignored. So what you actually mean, Wolfgang, is that you smelled money and you want a big share of the cake. It's all a matter of perspective, isn't it? But I am afraid that we are indeed entitled to compensation, yes. Yeah well that is something you should have thought about before you signed the contract. We have a deal and that's the one I'm sticking to. And that is final. [curses in Flemish] Don't worry. Are you sure there's nothing he can do? Forget it. He knows shit about movie financing he doesn't know what he's doing. He's a leech baby. Hey, I know the type, I used to be one of them. No problemo. * [Music] [Paul] Dammit Dylan what the fuck are you doing? Listen, all I'm saying-- No all I'm saying is read my lips you moron, you're fucking drunk, you don't know your lines, you're trying to make an ass of me in front of the crew, it's not gonna happen Dylan, not in this lifetime or any other motherfucking lifetime. Look, in Lebecq's book-- Look, I don't give a fuck about Lebecq's book. Here's the script, learn your fucking lines. -I want him ready in 20 minutes. -Right. [Vomiting] You don't feel better? Shall I get you some coffee? You look like you're ill. Blow me baby. Some other time perhaps, huh? Let's go. Let's not do that. Hm? [Max] What's gotten into you both? You know we can't afford this wasted time this is no big fucking studio production you know? Hey Max you go talk to Dylan. No I'm talking to you, you and your god damn method bullshit. I don't want this guy to become Lebecq. I want him to be on the set and do his job. You assured me that you could handle him and the first thing I know he's fucking up. Man, this guy is worse than Marilyn fucking Monroe. Motherfucking -[curses in Flemish] -[Phone ringing] And you're to blame too. You're his fucking co-star so you should keep him in line. Max please. Vogel. What? What? Oh fuck, fuck fuck fuck. [Max] What I'm saying is that this motherfucking lawyer of Lebecq's victim's families is protesting the movie. He's sent faxes to everyone warning them that the rights aren't clear. Government, co-producers, bonders, name it. And worse of all to Gregory, our American sales agent. The result, not a dime, until this is solved. [Paul] So what you're saying Max is that you don't own the rights. I do, believe me I do. I have a great, great fucking deal. That's the whole problem. So this fuckface lawyer claims that there are new elements which haven't been disclosed and he has objected formally. [curses in Flemish] Why don't you just pay him off Max? How many times do I have to tell you? This is no big studio production. Until now I've been paying for everything myself. I can't go on doing this. [Michelle] So what does this mean? Do we stop shooting? Is this it? Katherine? [Katherine] Well our cash-flow allows us another week, and that's the end of it. You have to trust me Paul. Hey I know I can do it. In a week I'd raise the Titanic if I have to. You have to trust me. Stick with me. Max I wouldn't trust you to take my dog for a walk. [Max] Oh Paul, one more thing. I guess, uh, the next few days your checks may bounce. I'm sorry. * [Music] Max it's past midnight, come to bed and get some rest. Working hours in the late baby. I'm finishing this email for Gregory and I'm done. [Phone rings] Vogel. Katherine what the fu-- Alright just a moment. [speaking in Flemish] [Harry speaking in Flemish on T.V.] [speaking in Flemish] Shoot Kat, what do you got in mind? Yeah baby, you're the best. This is a great fucking idea wha-- No listen, listen. First thing in the morning you phone the [speaking in Flemish] piece of shit waiver and you set up a meeting ASAP, capeesh? Good, yeah bye. What? I'm telling you baby I'm a player. And when I'm good, I'm really good. Come here. [Laughs] [cashier] 750 please. [Cash register sounds] The rest. No. Come on. Turn around. Turn around. I'm sorry. [shotgun blast] Cut. [Paul] That was good Dylan. Really good. [crewman] Okay boys that's it. Paul? Move on. No doughnuts? What kind of movie is this? [Paul] Yeah. Right. Hey Paul, I'm really sorry about what happened yesterday. It's alright, just don't fuck up again alright? There's a reason that you and I are here in Belgium making a movie. It's not like we're on top of the world. It's not like we're a couple of kings anymore. So let's try to behave and you can, uh, maybe we could make a good little movie. What you think about that? Yeah man no problem. I won't screw up no more. I just took a couple of Xanax, just to relax you know. Yeah well that and a quart of vodka. Hey you like that thing I did with the shades? It's nice. You know in this book, Lebecq has this fixation about hiding his face. He thinks he's disfigured. So I thought that by almost dropping the shades he'd feel exposed. And that's why he fucking wastes her. You're really starting to get into this, uh, Lebecq character, aren't you? * [Music] [Inaudible in Flemish] [speaking in Flemish] Shades 13 on 2 take 6. [crewman] Action. [Paul] Do it again. [Paul] Keep it rolling. [Paul] Cut. Armon? -[speaking in French] -How was I? Our camera problem, this time there was no reflection on the glasses. Very good shot. Happy camera. Jerk off. He wouldn't know a good shot if it bit you in the fucking balls. This is my room. What're you doing in my room? I thought we could rehearse together. But if you want me to leave, fine. See this? I was 12 when this happened. [Dylan] Come here. The guy who did it to me wasn't even charged. No one was held accountable. Stop it, this self pity of yours. I have tire marks all over my face. Or what was left of it. And when I was 13 I was sent away from school. The teachers said there was no use. You know, this isn't in the script. I got it out of Lebecq's book. The kiss as well? No. That was just improv. Where the fuck is my smirnoff? Fuckers took my pills as well. I've got some aspirin. Fuck 'em. I'm getting out of this place! Wait! -* [Music] -[cheers] [Laughs] [speaking in Flemish] Done deal? Okay. Shake hands. Done deal. [speaking in Flemish] [speaking in Flemish] [Phone rings] [speaking in Flemish] Dammit Max, pick it up. To Smirnoff, and to Freddy Lebecq. Paul? Hi it's Michelle. Um look I'm here with Dylan and uh it's really getting out of hand could you please come over and help me? The, um, the angels bar. It's close to the studio, just around the corner. Okay. Yeah okay, thanks. Bye. [Dylan] Listen guys, I want you to hangout on set with me. I think it'll make the part seem more-- Meet Michelle. Her boyfriend pays my salary. Look Dylan I think you've had enough. Why don't you go fuck your uptight boyfriend. Fuckin yuppie. If you don't someone else will. Somebody with your ambition. Hey hey hey hey. [speaking in Flemish] [Dylan] Fuck you. Fuck the lot of you. I'll pay. How much? [speaking in Flemish] What? 6,000. Without tip. Ha ha ha. Dylan! He just left, try that way. Where do you think he went? I don't know he just disappeared. He was totally drunk. It's all my fault. It's not your fault. I've known the little prick for a long time. It's the way he is. Maybe I should've, uh, handled him a little differently. No I, I hit him and I shouldn't have hit him. You should've hit him harder. Why don't I just take you home? Yeah. [Coughing] [crashing noise] [Knocking on door] * [Music playing] Mijnheer Lebecq? [Knocking on door] Mijnheer Lebecq? What? -[coughing] -Can't you read? Do not disturb! Is alls okay? Oh fuck you! Everything okay? Everything okay? Fuckers. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! I'm a movie star. A fuckin movie star. Splash of vodka. Downer. Splash of Bitter Lim One benny and brandy going down. [bottle crashes] Fuck this asshole! -[Paul] Woah, woah. -Fuck this asshole! And fuck you too! Max. Max. Max, this is embarrassing. Especially in front of the crew. But it's true Paul. I fight day and night to make this movie, I sink all my personal money in it. I even get this lawyer problem solved and you people can't even keep a fucking actor from going crazy. Do I have to do everything myself? And you, what's gotten into you hitting Dylan Cole? Cool it Max, take a valium. Nothing. We checked all the hospitals, the hotels, the police, no Dylan. Shit, well then double check, capeesh? Katherine. I need to know how long we can shoot around. Well, I think we can reschedule for about two days. Paul? Three. Well let's start shooting then. Come on. Let's make a movie come on. Come on boys and girls. Let's make a movie. [crewman] Okay guys, let's get ready. Everybody all set please. Standby. [Max] Fix it. [Exhales] Max. Maxy. Oh. What if he checked in somewhere using a different name? Oh Michelle please. No no no let's say his character's name, Lebecq. Freddy Lebecq. He's Freddy Lebecq? Yeah the fucker would be crazy enough. Right. Yeah one of those cheap hotels that rent by the hour. You pay them in advance, give them any name you want. Yeah fuck it you could be right. Give me my cell phone. [knocking] [Max] Dylan? [Max] Dylan come on, open up. -It's Max here, come on. -[knocks] Open up come on! [speaking in Flemish] Shit. Shit. Fuck fuck fuck. This can't be true, this can't be true. I'm dead, I'm fucking dead. He's not dead he's breathing call 911 for christ's sake. Dylan? [Harry speaking in Flemish] Fuck it Kat I thought the doctor wasn't going to talk. And couldn't you stop Harry? For christ's sake. [Harry speaking in Flemish on T.V.] Fuck! [reporter speaking in Flemish on T.V.] Oh fuck! [reporter speaking in Flemish on T.V.] [reporter on T.V.] Dylan Cole is recovering in a local hospital and for the moment it's not clear what's going to happen to the movie. Shades is a European-American co-production directed by Paul S. Sullivan and based on the life of notorious Belgian serial killer, Freddy Lebecq. Dylan Cole plays the lead and it is unsure whether he tried to commit suicide or whether this should be regarded as a tragic accident. And in other news-- [turns off T.V.] [remote crashes against something] [cursing in flemish] This is the end of it. [Noise outside] It's the crew probably. They've been asking to see you for some time. [crew member] We need to know what's happening Max. We've been working for two weeks now and haven't seen a dime yet so it's only natural. I cannot believe you people. Dylan almost died and the only thing you can think of is money? What kind of people are you anyway? You got the greatest job in the world, you get well paid, you're staying in a five star hotel--- [crew member] Expensive five star hotel. [speaking in Flemish] He didn't mean it that way Max but let's face it all the problems, the lack of money, and now Dylan in the hospital? Wouldn't it be better to have the insurance pay up and forget about it? Are you out of your fucking minds? No way no insurance. Dylan is okay and he'll be back. [speaking in Flemish] Get it? [speaking in Flemish] What do you want? What-- What do you want from me? You want to make a fucking movie or what? You want my shirt? You want-- you want my shirt. Here. Here it is my shirt. -Here. -Max come on. Take my shirt, here! Take my fucking shirt. [cursing in flemish] [Kathrine] Shirt please. [speaking in Flemish] * [Music] You crying for me. Are you crying for me? Are you crying for me? [Paul] So... What's shakin baby? I, I thought I'd stay in a hotel tonight. Max is too wired. Tell me Paul Do you like doing this movie? [Paul] Woah woah woah hey hey baby baby baby Don't you think one tragedy around here is enough? Answer me. Do you like doing this movie? Yeah making movies is what I do. Well, where my career is going I'm lucky just to be here. -[Laughs] -You know this is so silly. I finally get to be in a movie and now it won't even get made. I wouldn't be too sure about that. You don't worry about things like that baby you just... let it go. Paul do you think I'm an actress? [Michelle] I know that Max pushed me, the only reason why you accept me is because you have to. I'm the producer's girlfriend. Well you got a point there honey. Come here I wanna show you something. [crewman] Action. * [Music] [Michelle on film] Do you really have to make this much coffee? You know what the doctor said with the chest pains and all that. But we should think about the kids for once. I do think about the kids, you know that. Look how much money we've saved. Yeah for you to buy a new car. Honey we can't go on driving the secondhand Skoda forever. Besides I wanna move up in the world. [Michelle] Yeah and for that you need a new car. You're gonna end up back in jail Freddy. You and that car and that nice friend of yours. You don't get it baby do you? Louie kept me going in jail. Without him I don't know what I would have done. Now Louie wants a favor and I gotta help him. No you don't! You've got to help yourself You've got to help me trying to make something out of this marriage. [Crying] * [music on the radio] So what do you think? Ahh. What do I think? Mm-hmm. Wanna know the truth? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think you're a natural baby. Just... Trust yourself. [Max] I'm telling you for once and for all. I decide when invoices get paid. Excuse me Mr Vogel it won't happen again but they kept on calling and calling and-- [speaking in Flemish] [Max] And remember, nobody ever got rich by paying his debts. [curses in Flemish] Gregory is on the phone. Shit I knew it. Greg baby, how is sunny LA? [Greg on phone] Max, Max. What the hell's going on over there? You saw it on CCN. [Greg on phone] Max the whole world did, of course I did. Hey Greg man I'm sorry Dylan is okay, he'll be out in no time it was a minor accident. Uh I just spoken to the bonders and-- [Greg on phone] Max you crazy son of a bitch. You're a genius Max. Listen all the major territories are being sold at double the price you ready for that? Isn't that incredible? Listen this thing is going through the roof Max. Everybodys on the phone and we're doing terrific. Terrific Max. -Everyones on the phone from Iceland to little Croatia -[Laughs] So you want us to go ahead? [Greg on phone] Do I want you to go ahead? Get Dylan on his feet man. From now on he's our star and our ticket to the bank, capeesh? I sure will Greg I sure will. Really, um does this mean that you will be wiring me the money? [Greg] Yeah Max of course I will but first you get this rights thing resolved, okay? Hey don't forget, Dylan's the man okay? Capeesh? Okay, okay bye Greg. [Max singing "Money Makes the World Go Around"] Max? -[Max] We got something to celebrate baby. -[Michelle] What? Hey we're rollin again! This is Citizen fucking Kane we're making here baby. Come here. Come, come to Vogel. What we got here? Oh, ah. [Laughs] * [Music] [Inaudible news reports] [Dylan] And you thought I wasn't big anymore. Look at this. I'm Brad fucking Pitt thats who I am. I even got a nasty one. [Paul] You're gonna die. Well I don't know who wrote this but he almost told the truth. Listen, guys I'm really sorry. [Paul] Dylan, you're destroying yourself. You could talk. Your liver must be unique in the history of medicine. Well what do I know Paul. It won't happen again. Tomorrow I'm outta here, ready for my close-up. Enough about me lets talk about the movie. Yeah, the movie. That's work. Max. Did you know Lebecq was wrongly convicted early in his life? A holdup he didn't commit. He even passed a lie detector test but he still got canned. Seven fuckin years for something you didn't do. Whatever this guy did, society just kept spitting him out. [Paul] That of course is the perfect reason to become a mass murderer huh? Listen Paul can we at least talk about it? Uhhhh. Max, I wanna meet Lebecq. Jesus Dylan. -[Max] I really don't think-- -[Dylan] It could make a great movie. No, we have the obligation to make a great movie. Listen, even if we could get the authorization I don't think it-- Nah, this is a film with social relevance. We can't make a movie about a serial killer and just ignore the realities that cause this behavior. I wanna meet this guy. Tell the story the way it's supposed to be told. I don't believe this. [Max] Mmm, Dylan may have a point Paul. Lets face it, I mean... Look Max, to tell you the truth I don't think this is the... time or the right place to go into this shit. Why don't we uh, why don't you get some rest and we'll talk about it later? Tell me what can I do, it's crazy but we need him. I'm trying to save the movie, Paul. Our movie. If we don't do it his way he's not gonna show up, or worse. Ah, fuck. I get what you're saying but you know what you're doin? I mean thats a far cry from shooting a completely different fucking movie. Thought about the media? Or what that lawyer's gonna say? Hey Lebecq a hero. If word gets out we're dead. It's simple we keep it out of the media. And as far as the victim's family goes, I'm signing a fair and watertight deal by the end of this week. It's not gonna be a problem. Hey, this is Europe. We don't sue each other every day, you know? You're crazy Max, just like everybody else on this fucking movie. I'm not crazy Paul. I'm a dreamer. Moviemaker. * [Music] [Paul] That was magnificent, whatever that was. Green eel. Remind me I'm gonna have to take a bag of those little buggers home with me. [Michelle] Well actually it's not green eel it's um, eel in green. Paling in 't Groen. [Paul] Paling in 't Groen, sounds like a fuckin horror movie. [Laughs] Can I get you anything? Would you like a piece of chocolate or something? -No. -How about a ham sandwich? -No. -No? How about a drink? Yes. Ah. Ah shit. Somebody's fuckin with us. Is this serious? Is that serious? No that's not serious. This is serious. Here's to green eels and, good looking women. Hmm. Fuck. For christ's sake. I told you to have dinner with him, not to spend the fucking night. It's 4 o'clock in the morning dammit. Was he drinking? Some wine, yes. Oh of course. Did you stop him? I did. Good girl. I love you baby. Frankly Max I don't like this. I feel like I'm being used. Nonsense. We're doing this for the movie. Our movie. By the way, um, Paul got a threatening letter. He says Dylan got one too. [Max] Well, we got a few at the office too. Nutcase. It was to be expected with all the media attention. Don't worry baby, Max is here. Wanna make love? Never ask Max. Just go for it or go to sleep. Ah, garlic. What the hell did you eat? Snails. And Paling in 't Groen. You know I hate garlic. Yeah? Well Paul likes it very much. Oh he does, does he. Mmm-hmm. Fucking directors. * [music] Are you ready for the sharks? [Harry] Dylan, good to see you. How are you? [Dylan] Better, that's all I can say. [Harry] When do you start shooting again? -[Dylan] We're good to go from tomorrow guys, thanks very much. -[Harry] Take care. [Dylan] Jesus, look at these fucking leeches. You scum, get a fuckin proper job. Assholes, scum. * [music] [Reporter speaking in Flemish on T.V.] Stand maggot. Showtime. [cell door opens] So, here we are. Mr. Cole, this is Freddy Lebecq. Freddy, this is Dylan Cole. The actor who's playing you in the movie. So, gentlemen, let's all sit down. I'm very pleased to meet you Mr Lebecq. He does speak English huh? Sure he does. [in Flemish] Freddy. [Freddy] Mr Cole. This means a lot to me. [Freddy] I know your movies and I'm very honored that you're playing me. The honor is mine Mr Lebecq. I read your book, and I know what society has done to you. I just hope this movie can be of some support. It has been very long since someone's supported me. Except for Mr Van Riet of course. I wanna portray you as truthfully as possible. That's why I wanted to meet you. To find out who you really are. To understand why you became-- A killer. No. No. The man that you are. You know, Mr Cole, once upon a time I used to be a good guy. I worked hard. was a loving husband. Tried to give my children everything I had missed. But then, when they took all that away from me, something snapped. [Van Riet] Freddy is referring to the trial for a robbery he committed in 1972. It was a jury trial, which is eh, normally reserved for murder cases. -[speaking in Flemish] -Yes. They fucked me. That's what happened. They brought me in front of a jury for no reason and sent me away for seven years. So, I lost my wife, my children, my savings, my freedom. Everything. [speaking in Flemish] I didn't have money for a lawyer. So they gave me this young public defender. Didn't know a thing. Didn't do... shit. Only gave me one piece of advice. Try to look good in front of the jury. So I did. Put on a nice suit. Shaved. Cut my hair. Didn't bring my sunglasses. [faint sound of people talking in court] It killed me. It just killed me. I'm sorry but the witness said he saw a man with blonde hair. He saw a man with blonde hair indeed. But let's be honest, Mr Lebecq. 2000 years of crime taught us that people like you are masters of disguise. But the witness didn't mention sunglasses. I always wear shades. Well thats certainly true. He always wears sunglasses. [Lawyer] What we have here is a man with many disguises indeed. Not just a petty criminal Mr President, members of the jury, but a leader of a feared group of gangsters. A man who knows exactly what he's doing. Which game to play at which particular moment. Freddy Lebecq is dangerous. He always has been and he always will. Therefore, I request maximum penalty. Cut. [Paul] Dylan. I told you, Michelle's the one with the tears. Not you. Paul, what can I say. I can only act what I feel. [Paul] Dylan I'm the director I can see what's going on in the monitor it doesn't work. Okay? Now do what I want, please. Look, this is the turning point in Lebecq's life. He loses everything. His life is destroyed. And you're telling me I can't shed one single tear? I don't want you to cry. It doesn't work for the scene. Yeah well I think you're an insensitive fool. Like I say I can only act what I feel. Look fuck you Dylan, we're just gonna keep going on and on and on I don't care how many takes we're gonna do Do what I want. [Paul] Let's get ready to do it again. Uhh, pain in the ass. Paul, this is not going to work. What're you talking about? Listen you know I'm on your side but Dylan doesn't seem to understand I think we should-- Oh come on Dylan doesn't wanna understand he's just bein a prick. Well 'm telling you this is not going to work. We got the courtroom for one day only so let's do it Dylan's way and get on with it okay? Max don't be such a weak man. I am what I am. This is the last take. Shit. -Peter. -[Peter] Okay first positions please. Quiet. * [ambient music] [knocking] [Paul] Yeah? It's me, Michelle. [Noises inside room] Hi. Hi. -Can I come in? -Of course -Eh it's a little messy I wasn't expecting company. -That's okay. Listen what I wanted to say is that um, I know Dylan is difficult and Max can be a real pain in the ass but um, I'm on your side. Well that's very kind of you. You know Michelle this is a real dirtbag business. And you're a nice girl. But you could go around and sleep with every god damn producer on the planet you could be in all their movies But at the end of the day if you do it like that you're gonna end up a two dollar whore. Hmm I don't have to listen to this. What's the matter we having a little problem with the truth here? No I think you've had too much to drink. I don't think I've had enough. Well I think I should go. Well why don't we just have a drink? I mean I know why you're here. Don't play games with me Michelle that motherfucker Max sent you up here to keep an eye on me. I don't need anybody watching my ass I'm a big boy. I got my job, you got your job. You just know your lines, okay? Do you wanna know why I'm here? I am here because I thought that you were the only decent human being on this show but obviously I was wrong so goodbye. Ah come on I'm sorry, hey hey hey. -I'm very-- I'm very very sorry -Let go of me you stupid-- I'm really really [Kissing sound] I'm really sorry. * [music] [man in the hallway] Mr. Sullivan? Excuse me. Are you Paul Sullivan the director? Well it depends. Well I'm sorry to burst in on you like this but uh, I have to know. You have to know what? Well, um, my father was a very good friend of [Belgian name] one of Lebecq's victims as you probably know and uh, right now we are uh, very worried about this movie you are making. You're worried? I don't understand you're worried about what? We heard rumors about you. About you going to turn Lebecq into a here and frankly that is something we cannot tolerate. Look, my little friend, if you have a problem why don't you just call my fuckin lawyer I don't have a problem Mr Director. You have. Jesus Christ. Max can I show them in? They're really impatient. Let them simmer just a little bit longer. This looks okay. I need five copies. Aren't you giving them a lot? 15% out of the net profit baby. 5% for Magritte, 5% for waiver, and 5% for the families. All out of the net. And there won't be any net. Correctamundo. If Hollywood can do it, so can we. [Laughs] [speaking in Flemish] Show them in. [speaking in Flemish] [Max speaking in Flemish] Max, [speaking in Flemish] In English, please. Listen guys this is so unfair. We had a deal for 15% not 20, okay? We shook hands on it. I even paid for the champagne god dammit. [Van Riet] Wolfgang is worried about his clients Max. You should understand. [Wolfgang] They told that the film would show their suffering, not Lebecq's. But, where do you get those nonsense this is, these are god damn lies. Whatever you say Max but they don't trust you. Basically they don't want this film to be made at all. It took a lot of convincing of my part before they agreed. Indeed, you should be happy instead of angry. [Wolfgang] Listen Max, we can continue to block you as long as we want. So it's simple, 20% or no movie. Take it or leave it. Okay okay, I'm willing to settle this. There are however two conditions. One, we sign now, here and today, Katherine makes the changes and we sign the contract. And two, you guys sign off on the script. And from now on, you stay out of my life and out of my movie. Capeesh? Done deal. Deal. Meh... -[Laughs] -[phone dialing] [speaking in Flemish] * [music] [Dylan on T.V.] Okay what I want to say is, yesterday I met Freddy Lebecq -What the fuck. -[Dylan on T.V.] that meeting had a profound effect on me. I now feel that the horrors for which Mr Lebecq is serving a life sentence Is this live? How come I don't know about this? [Dylan on T.V.] by a series of judicial errors. Therefore I've decided to openly support Freddy Lebecq's request for parole. -What is this fucker up to? -[Dylan on T.V.] I know it's being considered at the moment by the minister of justice And so I call upon all Belgian intellectuals to join me with their support. Oh no not now please not now. -[Dylan on T.V.] Thank you very-- -Fuck! God damn idiot. Fucking actors. I want these contracts in one minute. [Dylan] No no that's not the case. I'm defending Lebecq because I feel he's been misunderstood. [Mark] Liar! Liar! Lebecq is a fucking killer. Hey Lebecq is a dirty killer! [Indistinguishable yelling] [Dylan] Hey tough guy! [Dylan] Mr fuckin tough guy huh? [Mark] This film should be forbidden you fucking liar! [Indistinguishable yelling] [Harry speaking in Flemish on T.V.] [Phone rings] Yeah? Ah. Well that's great Max I'm happy for you. Wait a minute Max don't pull this shit with me. You've been fucking with me since we started this film alright? Hey listen Max I got fuckin checks bouncing all over this town. Yeah I got crediters crawling up my ass alright? No no no no fir-- hey come on now you've stuck me in some shit bag hotel Nah I'm not gonna do it Max. You want me to do some bullshit talk show for you? Forget about it sweetheart, the favors are over. No no forget it. * [music] Okay you guys we're on in a few seconds. Are you ready? Ready to [indistinguishable] [announcer in Flemish] ladies and gentlemen, the Harry Koning Show. [Applause] Good evening. What are you still pissed off about? The checks have come through didn't they? Come on. Let's do our job and defend the movie okay? Our guests for tonight, the producer of the film, Maximillian Vogel. [Applause and booing] Director Paul Sullivan. [Applause and booing] And last but certainly not least, Dylan Cole. [Applause and booing] But of course we have other guest who I have to start with. Someone who's very upset about this film. Who claims he's representing Lebecq's victims. -Mark Vandenbroeck -[Applause] As you can see we have brought together all the parties here to explain their position. They should be thrown in prison! [Cheers] [Mark] People who protect murderers belong in jail and not on a movie set. [Cheers] [speaking in Flemish] let's follow the usual procedure, okay? You have objections to the making of this film. -Yes sir. -Why? Well, [clears throat],first of all, why do you wanna make a film about Freddy Lebecq? Eh? A man who killed 6 people. 6 innocent people in cold blood. And as if making a film about him isn't enough of an insult, now you movie people are making this bastard into a hero. [Paul] I don't know why this man keeps accusing us of turning Lebecq into a hero. What we're doing is we're recreating and exposing the truth. -Well then Mr Director, you are a bloody liar. -[cheering] Quiet maybe let's go back to the facts then. 25 years ago on a cold winter night several family members of our next guest [Harry on T.V.] were brutally murdered without any reason by Freddy Lebecq. [Harry] Understand ladies and gentlemen that it must be very painful and that it takes a lot of courage for this man to be here tonight so let's give him a warm welcome. -Louis Verbiest -[applause] Say there Louis, how many people died that dreadful night? Three. My son, my daughter-in-law, and my granddaughter. Before the show you told me that tonight you only have one single question for the filmmakers. You there, sir. You have said on television that the monster who killed my family is a victim. I ask you, -what about me? -[applause] [Dylan] Excuse me sir I don't think Lebecq would've killed your family if society hadn't turned him into a monster by putting him in jail for a crime he didn't commit. Liar! -They should hang you together with Lebecq. -[Applause] Sir. Suppose your family were killed in a gas explosion due to criminal neglect of a gas company. -Would you still be protesting today? -[Boos] I think if you listen to my point, you'll begin to understand it a little better you know? [Screaming] [Harry] We've got everything under control. Everything's gonna be alright. We continue in about five minutes. Ay, remember what I told you about your ratings? This is gonna be big guys, terrific T.V... [Sigh] This is bullshit. -Let's get outta here. -[Harry] This is great guys. It's great. It's gonna be a hit. [chanting, boos] * [music] [drops remote] [Michelle] What do you want Paul? What do you really want? [Paul] A three picture deal would be nice. [Michelle] That's it? [Paul] That would be enough for me. How bout you? What do you want? [Michelle] Well I want more than that. [Paul] Well you'll have to talk to Max. -[Laughs] -[Michelle] You're such a prick. [Michelle laughs] [Crowd chanting and screaming] Hey Paul. Meet Bob, Crazy Mike. They're gonna look after me from now on. [Dylan] I think they'd look good in the movie. Dylan I don't care about this crap just please go and get dressed. Okay whatever. Come on guys. [Paul] Lily. What's going on? I'm sorry but Dylan really insisted that I made him up in the hotel room. But I asked Mary to come early and take over the set. I'm the big wienerschnitzel around here okay? I'm the one who changes the call times not uh, Dylan. You're an hour and a half late. Lily, don't do it again. [Paul] Hey Lily. Don't sleep with him. He's just an actor. [Paul] Okay here's exactly what I want you to do. I bump into you, push you aside, no apologies, I continue to the bathroom I come back again I smack into her, no apologies again You get a little excited, she calms you down. I come on over say something to you you get pissed you smash a bottle on the bar you come over hit it on my head and that's it. You got it? I ain't so sure Paul. Why is that Dylan? Well this is, this is my first scene in the movie. If I do it your way I fuck up my motivation plus I lose all sympathy right from the gut. Well, that's what it's all about is your... -uncontrolled rage. -Yeah, I understand that. But we could go for something subtle here. What if he breaks the bottle over my head so when I hit him it's legit. Small change, big difference. Here Peter, you take this. Why don't you direct the fucking scene? Paul? What are you doing here? -Max doesn't have time to see you. -[crashing sound] Uh... -Paul I, I um... -Set me up you cocksucker. I'm sorry man. I guess I owe you an explanation. Um, listen let's be cool about this okay? Let's be-- Come on come on! Come on Paul! Come on. Get your hands off me you slime. You little piece of shit. Don't you understand? You stupid fuck! I'm producing a movie here! This is show business you know? Get them out of here get them out of here. Ah dammit. -Talk to me. Talk to me. -Hey man. The movie was going down the drain until suddenly this whole... media circus with Dylan erupted and we started selling like hot cakes What was I supposed to do god dammit? The threatening letters, the thing with Vandenbroeck, the leaks to the press, it was all a setup you should've guessed. You sh-- you're in this business long enough you know? [Sighs] I'll tell ya Max, you're pathetic. Yeah, well such is life. Life is pathetic. Don't you get that? We're all trying to survive here. While Paul Smart Sullivan is quietly banging my little girlfriend. Just don't get any ideas Paul. Sweet little Michelle is quite the actress. She was in on it from the start. Hell, I even sent her to you to stop you from drinking, -did she ever overdo it. -[Michelle] You lying son of a bitch. Oh Jesus Christ the actress. Honey why don't you go sling some hash? Jesus. I'll tell you Max, you're one manipulative motherfucker. Look who's talking. Hah. Manipulation is what moviemaking is all about Mr Sullivan. Uhhh. Tell me uh... Tell me something Max. What about Dylan? That's about the only thing that wasn't produced. Dylan is a no good fuck but he turned out to be a giant PR machine without even being aware of it. Well I hate to enlighten you Max I hate to shock the shit out of you, but I quit and I'm off the movie. No Paul, you're not. And you know why? Cause this thing is getting bigger and bigger And it's bringing you right back where you belong in the major league and that is something that you won't be able to resist. Besides I got a waterproof contract. Hey, I should've let you in on it and I'm sorry I didn't, but hey man, I was only doing my job you know to the best of my capacity. Yeah... Who's this, uh, -Vandenbrook? -Vandenbrook? Vandenbrook is just an overzealous extra willing to do everything to make it. He's quite a character actor don't you think? [Paul laughs] Ahhh You're a real little faggot Max. You belong in some jail getting your asshole reamed out somewhere. [Laughs] Paul, Paul, Paul. You know diddly about this country. Nothing is impossible here. Everything can be arranged and constantly is. Hell, I bet you we could even make Lebecq escape if we wanted to. Producing, Paul. That is what this "A-planned", as we call it, is all about. Producing. Well Mr Producer, I'm outta here. Yeah, see you on the set Mr Director. [Van Riet and Lebecq speaking in Flemish] [Screaming] [speaking in Flemish] * [music] [Harry speaking in Flemish] Okay Paul. You give me some psychological subtext, I'm all yours. Ah, Jesus. You come into the parking lot with your wife Two cops come out of nowhere they shoot you. Fascist pigs, huh? Whatever you say Dylan. Fascist pigs. Peter, you set? [Peter] Yeah, everything okay I'm just giving them instructions. Mike, Bob, you ready? [Mike] Yeah. Yeah we wait for the guys in the other car and then we go in. Right? Okay I will repeat it once more. You speed up after about 50 meters you stop right in front of Dylan and Michelle You jump out of the car, they resist arrest, and you shoot Dylan in the right shoulder is that clear? Yeah yeah okay. Uh, is there still some time to piss? Yeah, no problem I guess we start shooting in 10 minutes so no problem. Here's your walkie good luck. You're not being fair Paul I have the right to explain. You don't have to explain I asked you to not to be like all the rest of the actresses and don't play games with me, didn't I? I wasn't playing games I was falling in love with you. Michelle everything's a fucking game, look around. [Peeing] [Door opens] [Footsteps] * [music] [Scream] [speaking in Flemish] [Grunting] [walkie talkie] Standby car number one. -Okay everyone we're rolling. -Action. And go ahead car number one. [Car starts] [cars screeching] [Mike speaking in Flemish] -What the hell? -Don't know Why isn't anyone moving? What's goin on? [speaking in Flemish] [speaking in Flemish] Look out! Down! Get down! [speaking in Flemish] [Gun shots] [Screaming] [Gun shots] [continuous gunshots] [speaking in Flemish] [continuous gun shots] Call an ambulance! Come on come on! Check out Dylan he's been hit. [Michelle] Shit. [Paul] What the fuck? [Michelle] What is this? You didn't yell cut man. [Laughs] [crewman] Okay okay we're shooting blanks. How was I? You were great You were really great. * [music] [Door opens] -[Paul] And cut. -Yeahhhhh!!!! [Banging on door] -[crewman] That's a wrap thank you guys. -[Cheers] [Harry speaking in Flemish] * [music] Don't listen to them, bunch of lies [Laughs] Champagne. To allies in war. Listen guys it was never personal it's always been about the movie. Max, you're just a real piece of shit. Well, maybe so But I got great news for you my friend.
