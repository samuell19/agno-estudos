- I was only inside for a minute. I had to drop something off. - It's a red-ass world, honey baby. - Please. I can't afford to miss my class. - So what's the story? - He's towing my car. I was only in there for a minute. There was no place to park. - No problem. Can't you just let it down for her? - Piss off. - Listen, numb nuts, this car's not ticketed. In case you didn't know, it's illegal to tow an unticketed car in this state. So I guess if it's not sitting on all four wheels in about 10 seconds, you're looking at grand theft auto and tomorrow's cover story. So smile. Have a nice day. I'm Sam Nash. - Lauren Daly. Thanks a lot. - I'll see you later. - Okay. - Where's this slime bag Duffy? We wanna see him. - What did he do now? What's the problem? - Hey, guys. Here's a shot of that fire yesterday. - Okay. - Okay. - Hey, you. - Goddammit, Duffy, you lousy son of a bitch. - I think you got something wrong here. I'm not Duffy. - You tell Duffy we're after him and we're not going to forget this. - When we find him, we're gonna rip his balls off. - If we can find them. Bye. - Are they gone? - Do you realize you almost got me castrated? What was that all about? - What, didn't you read my column? Yeah, here you go. Those are the stud baggers. You know, those bimbos the coaches are using to recruit the blue-chip jocks straps. - You mean the ones you called hookers? - Yeah. I merely suggested that they were minor in solicitation. So you get the goods on that monkey abuser? - I just can't break into his office, Duffy. Jesus. You know, Geraldo Rivera would've been up his ass with a flashlight. You're hopeless, Nash. - Robert, can you give me an overhead? Thank you. Standby to inject. Five, four, three, two...injector. - How long does it take these brain cells to start revitalizing? - With the rats, cytoplasmic regeneration took about 20 minutes. - How much of its loss capacity can it expect to regain? - All of it. 100%. - Not bad. - What do you mean, "not bad?" No one has ever revitalized a damaged brain cell. No one. You're witnessing the most significant breakthrough in modern medical history. Robert. Robert, what is she doing? What's happened? - Look at this EEG, doctor. - What's going on? Answer me. What is going on? - I don't know. Mr. Oakley, hold up. Listen, I know I'm close. I just need a little more time. - Our company's been footing your bills for over two years. It's time to cut our losses. - You cannot just pull my funding like this. Can't you see what my work can mean for mankind? - All I saw was one off pissed off monkey. - Don't you drug company hacks care about anything else but pushing pills? Mr. Oakley, please, think of the benefits to anyone with brain injury, whether it's an accident victim, or it's people with Alzheimer's disease, or alcoholics. - We don't fund pie in the sky. We fund results. - And I will get -- Mr. Oakley, I will get these results! Please, give me a few more months. - Okay, you've got 60 days. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Oakley. Thank you. - Dr. Ethridge. Hi. Dr. Ethridge, I'm Sam Nash with the Independent Voice. - Oh, oh. - I'd love to interview you on your research. - Oh, yes? - Yeah. - Yes. Thank you. Thank you. - How about next week? - Um, I'm very preoccupied right now. Thank you. Thank you very much. - I could come by any time. My schedule's pretty open. Thank you, yes, thank you. - Thanks. - Sure, keep going. Can I help you with something? - Oh, sorry. I've just never seen such pretty clothes before. - What are you doing in my room? - I'm your new roomie. Debbie Gilbert. - You're starting a little late in the semester, aren't you? - I'll make it up. - I'm Lauren Daly. So, what were you, sick or something? - Pregnant. I had an abortion. Sorry, I didn't mean to gross you out or anything. - I guess I'm just not used to hearing people admit stuff like that. - Well, welcome to the real world. - Nash, my lad, you're never gonna make it in this racket. Too much of a fucking idealist. - You mean I don't make up lies like you? - Hey, it's the writer's duty to embellish when the facts are boring, right? - You're boiling the bun of the First Amendment. - You tell him, dude. - Yeah, well, if you had any hair on your ass, you'd slip over to that ghoul's lab and catch him humping his monkeys. - Humping his monkeys? Well, all right, let's go get 'em. - Excuse me for a second. Fuck off. Now, he's cranking out some major mutations, man. I can smell it. - You're a terminal cynic, Duffy. You only see one color. Shit brown. - Well, turd is a turd, is a turd, right? - I'll drink to that. - What's that for? - Patience, my lad. - Yo. Don Ho. Two more here. - Two more here. - Aren't you afraid of catching some disease? - Never been sick a day in my life. Now, look, here's what we're gonna do. We'll wait 'til about one, then sneak on over to the lab, okay? Stage one. And I'll rifle through his records, you take a few pictures and we'll free all the monkeys on the way out. How about that? - That's illegal. - Yeah, well, so is picking your nose in public. Stage two. - What's stage three? - And four. Three, two, one. - Oh, Jesus. - I'll drink to that. So what'd he say? - I'm not breaking into any place until I've got all the facts. - Well, that's how you get the facts, Jacko. - No, count me out. - Oh, you pussy. Well, look, lend me your camera then. Okay? Come on. Come on. Yeah, yeah, I need that. - Watch this. - Don't worry about it. Let's go. - Lab surveillance camera checks out. VCR operational. Hey, Charlie. Yeah, we copy. - Put the coffee on. I'm coming back in 20. 10-4, - Call the decor High-Tech Frankenstein. What the hell is that? What you been doing here, doc? Naughty, naughty, naughty. Hey there. They've been trying to give you some shock treatment, pal? Hey, all right. Yeah, hold still for a sec. That's it. You look like a great centerfold for me. Peanut? Just chill out, you're gonna get... All right, all right. Okay, good. Jesus. - What happened? - I dunno. It broke out of its cage. Started wrecking the lab. Crashed right through the window. - What the hell was this thing? It attacked our car like a mad dog. - This will set us back weeks. - Who can tell me the total number of sides and diagonals in this hexagon? Now, come on, it was on your homework assignment. Lauren? - I don't know. - Take a guess. - Six. - No, that's the number of sides. Kimberly? 12? - No, but close. Don't you think you've missed enough classes, Debbie, without showing up late? - I got mascara in my eye. - What a sleaze. - Perhaps you can answer this problem that's got your fellow students totally confused. - Oh, the hexagon one? 15. - Correct. Could you tell us how you arrived at your conclusion? - You've got six sides, plus the number of diagonals. So you start at any vertex and you draw three diagonals. You do that for all six vertices, but you're counting them twice. So you take half the number of the sides, times end to the third power. - Very good. How do you know all that stuff? - My IQ's 184. - Oh, God, you don't look... I'm sorry. - It's all right. Guys don't make passes at girls with glasses. - Bye. Hey, bud, what's shaking? - A new crop of prime freshman titties. - We need some fresh party meat. - There's two candidates. - Quick, gimme your notebook. - You got it, bud. - Excuse me, ladies, I'm conducting a little survey and I'd like to ask you a few questions. - Okay. - Okay. - Major? - Art. - Nuclear physics. - Good, very good. And phone numbers. - Hi. - Hi. - I see you met Love joy. One of our legendary lovers. - Take a hike, Nash. - Has he asked you if you wear panties yet? - No. - He will. Right, Joe? And then comes the one about sexual fantasies, right? Did I say something wrong? - Stay outta my face, punk. - What was that all about? - He and his buddies throw some interesting bashes. If you're into group sex. - No, I don't think so. I'd like you to meet my roommate, Debbie. Debbie, this is Sam, the guy who saved my car. - Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. I wish I had a white knight. I've gotta run. Bye. - Bye. So is that really true about those frat guys? - Don't let the ivy walls fool you. This place is a jungle. So you'd better watch out. - I will. - I better walk you to class. - Okay. - Where have you been, man? The chief's been screaming for your call. - I'm working on it. - It stinks like the Paris sewers in here. - Look, you want clean air, go join a commune. - You got my camera? - I need to borrow it for a couple more days. - A monkey broke out of the psych lab last night, got splattered by a campus cop car. - Wasn't there. - You bullshit so much, your teeth are brown. - Look, I said I wasn't there, okay? - Okay. All right. Look, you better clean yourself up and brush your teeth. - What for? - 'Cause you got a date. - I do? Yeah, I fixed you up with a roommate of this girl I like. - How many eyes has she got? - Trust me. She's more than your hands call for. We're talking shave, shampoo. Shower with soap. And don't forget to change your drawers. I'll pick you up at eight. - Shit. - Dr. Ethridge. I know. I'm working on it. It'll take me a couple of weeks to prepare a hew monkey. It was an accident, Mr. Oakley. I'm working on it. I have it under control. Yes, sir. Under control. Thank you very much for calling, Mr. Oakley. Yes, thanks. Thank you. Yes? - Here's the tape from the surveillance camera. - Oh. This is Dr. Ethridge. Give me Campus Police. - Your friend Duffy's a little weird. But he's nice. Do you think he likes Debbie? - Do worms like tender, young apples? - And what about you? Do you like me? - I don't know. Let me taste you. - Okay, so there I was, hiding in this closet with 20 humongous jocks looking to stomp me into oatmeal. - God, what did you do this time? - Well, I lit a fire and set off the sprinkler system. Yeah, then I slipped out a window in the back. - Wow, that's really smart. I would've never thought of that. - Yeah, well, I dunno...I picked up a few tricks along the way. Yeah, Gonzo journalism's kind of like, you know, like eating a lot when you don't have a colon, you know? - Meaning what? - Means you never know how it's gonna come out, you know? - Hi. - Hi. - You having a good time? - Yeah. - Yeah, I guess so. Do you mind if I excuse myself to the Louve? - No. - Mind holding my hand? - I'd love to. - Stay here. I'll be right back. - So...what do you think of Debbie? - She's brainy. But thank god she doesn't look like Einstein, huh? - Whoa, easy. - Just testing your reflexes. - You okay? - Yeah, sure. No problem. Let's go. - Hi, how you doing? What do you say you and me do it? - Come on, leave us alone. We're with dates. - Who? - Wood nuts and Dorkstein? You guys must be hard up. - Get lost, creep. - What do you say I lose my face in your tits, huh? - You heard her. Beat it. Let go, or I'll break your face. - Yeah? - Let him go. Let him go. - You're dead meat, assholes. So this is where you keep your etchings, huh? This is it. Home, sweet home. - You're neater than I am. - My dad was career Army. Ran our house like a boot camp. - You don't look like the military type. - I was the black sheep. - Oh, you're here on scholarship? - I won a journalism contest from high school. - What did you write about? - I exposed some companies that were dumping waste near the reservoir. - That's great. So have you made up your mind about me yet? - Yeah. - So where's your roommate? - Well, he's a gambling nut. Plays cards for days on end. He's never here. - Good. Is something wrong? - I was just a little worried about Duffy, that's all. - Don't worry. Debbie will take good care of him. - I'm sure she will. - Al Pacino's one of my favorites. - Yeah, I like Al Pacino, too. I think one of my favorite scenes is that one in... what is it, what is it? Oh, yeah, Injustice For All. You know, where he wigs out at that judge he's defending. What does he say? What does he say? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, yeah, "That man is a slime." Remember that? - Yeah. Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You're sweating. - Do you mind if we sat down? - Yeah. - Okay. - Are you one of those crusading reporters? - Nah. I just like nailing the crooks and the phonies, you know. - My dad was a crook. He got caught cheating on real estate deals until some guy shot him. My mom, she's in jail for writing bad checks. - Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know that. - It's all right, I just thought in case it mattered. - Well, hell, I mean, my family's crooker than yours. Yeah, my parents are doctors. Hold on a sec. - You sure you're okay? - Yeah, no problem. Must've been something I ate, huh? - Never had a guy stand up for me before. - Yeah, well, those guys are scrotes. I mean, somebody outta nuke their frat house. - You know, underneath all that bunk and BS, you're really kind of a sweet guy. - Yeah, well, tell that to all the subjects of my column. I mean, I've been burned in effigy more times than the football coach. - Hey. That's too rough. - I'm sorry about that. I'm really sorry about that. What? - Chris Walker. - What's with this wait, huh? Where are all the goddamn doctors? What is this bullshit? - Hey, give it a break, bud. - Hey, fuck you. Fuck you. Come on. - Calm down, calm down before I call... Somebody call the police! - Ma'am, what measures are being taken on campus for the upcoming bash? - The faculty is very concerned about this year's event. - And if the antics of last year are repeated, then this year's Halloween Ball will be the last. - Mr. Vice President, are you referring to the drinking? - Yes, I'm referring to the drinking, the drugs, the nudity, and the general lewd behavior that shames our entire university. Any questions? - What happened here? - A student, he must have been on something. - Are you sure it was Frank Duffy? - That's the name he gave at the desk. - Thanks. - Look, Doc, don't worry. We'll let you know as soon as we catch this guy. - Thank you. - Sure. - Dr. Ethridge. Can we please talk now? - No, not now. - You must be losing it, Love joy. Letting that dirt bag Duffy scum you off. - Next, some librarians are gonna be kicking your ass. - Hey, don't sweat it. I got it covered. - What are you gonna do, hire a bodyguard? - Or maybe get one of those sex exchange operations. - Listen, you dildos. I'm gonna have the last laugh. - Ooh, she's getting pissed. - You know what the sweetest thing in life is? - What? - Revenge. - I'm going to the library. You wanna come? - Oh, no thanks. I'm not feeling so hot. - You should take it easy. Hang on. There's a lot of flu going around. - Yeah. - Did Duffy give you that big hickey? - Yeah. - You better put some makeup on it. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Bye. - Duffy? Duffy? Hey, Duff, is that you? Duffy? Hey, man. - Hey, back in the '60s, students were freaking out by the busload. Every night, I had to come pull one out of a tree. What the hell was that? Come on. I'll go in this way, you go 'round the back. - Right. - Come outta there right now! - Chris? - Sam, go over to anthropology quick. A campus cop just got murdered. Thanks. - Dr. Ethridge. I think we need to talk now. - If you've got a minute, we can go over to my lab. - Why don't we? - Beer here. - Let's go kick some ass. Yeah! - Look. - She'll do. - Pull over. - Hey, want a little party? Come on, we'll show you a good time. - Let me alone, I'm sick. - Come on, we'll stick you with something, fix you right up. Come on. Let me alone. Come on. - Let go of me. No. - Beer. Have a beer. - No. Let me go. - Chugga, chugga, chugga. - Come on, babe. - Chugg, chugg, chugg. - Go, get outta here. - Let me go. What happened to Duffy? - I don't know. - Don't trick me around, Ethridge, he caught something from your monkey. - It's not a disease. The monkey had an abnormal reaction to synthetic protein that I'm developing. I need your help to find your friend before it's too late. - Why? So you can use him as another Guinea pig for your next experiment? Tell it to the cops. - Before you place that call, I suggest you remember I'm the only hope your friend has. - No, no, I'm sorry. - Here, let me show you something. This is an antigen that I'm developing from a blood sample that I took from the monkey. I just hope that we find your friend before the police do. Pig! ♪ Who's afraid of the big bad wolf ♪ ♪ The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf ♪ - I got firsts. - You always go first. - Wait, wait. Let's all stick her at once. - Yeah, we'll turn her into a porcupine, man. Yeah! - Maestro, a little sound. - Yeah. - Hit some lights. - Yeah. Let's play ball. - Move. - Hey, watch it. - So how'd you like dinner? - Oh, dinner was wonderful. - Good. Isn't that Debbie Gilbert? - She's probably stoned. - Crazy kids. - You passed my sorority house. Really? - Well, this is it. - You know, you're doing much better with the tutoring, but you're still behind the rest of the class. - Well, I need a C to stay in school. - I don't know about that. - What will it take for me to get one? - A lot of hard work. What was that? - Just a raccoon or something. What was that? - You stay here. Who's there? I'm warning you, I know Kung Fu. I chased him off. Kimberly? My god. - Can I help you? - Room number for Sam Nash? - Visiting hours are over, I'm sorry. Just a minute, please. 323. - Open up, Nash! Hold on. Hey. - Police. - What's this? - Search warrant. You alone? - Yeah. Hey, what's this for? You've got the wrong guy. - Nothing there. - Where's your pal Duffy? - I don't know, why? - A campus cop was murdered and we think it was him. - Duffy a killer? No way. No way. - Yeah? He trashed the infirmary today. - What kind of dope is he on? - None. I swear. This has gotta be a mistake. - You'd better call us if he contacts you. - Okay. - You left this on the table. - Oh, thank you. - What are you doing out here? - I'm just coming back from the library. - Hop on, I'll give you a ride. - Okay. You wanna come in for a minute? - Thanks, but I gotta go. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. I'll call you later. All right? - Okay. Bye. - Debbie? Debbie? Oh my God. - Help me. - What happened to you? - A fight. I'm gonna put you in the hospital. - No, no, no, no. Just put me in bed. Duffy. It's me, Sam. It's gonna be all right. Dr. Ethridge will help you. Just come with me. That's it. You can do it. We're still pals, right? Just follow me, Duff, just... - Kill me. - Kill me! - No. - Kill me. Kill me. No. Duffy... - Dr. Ethridge. - Duffy's dead. - I need to do an autopsy. Where is the body? - There's not gonna be any autopsy. It's over. - Sam, I must do an autopsy. Where is the body? Sam? I must do an autopsy. - I kept telling the crazy bastard not to smoke in bed. - He wouldn't listen. "Halloween Monster Stalks Campus." How about "demon killer?" What do you think, Sam? - I just heard about Duffy. I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do? - Look, I'm busy. - I didn't mean to bother you. - I'm sorry. - I haven't told Debbie yet. I'm worried about her. She's got this infected bite on her neck and she won't go to the doctor. - How did she get it? - From Duffy. - Let's go. Let me go in first. - Why, what's going on? - I can't explain it. Just get ready to run. - Oh my God. Sam. Debbie? Sam, what's going on? Please, tell me. - Let's get outta here. You better sit down for this one. - Okay. What is it? - I don't even know where to begin myself. It all happened so fast. Try. - Debbie, no! Debbie? - Who else knows about this? - No one. - I have to give her a sedative. Go and see if anyone's outside in the hallway. I have to move her to my lab. - No one. - Okay. Give me a hand. - Please, help her. - I'll do what I can. I'd like to be left alone with her now. - It'll be okay. Do you really think he can help her? Could we be infected? - I don't know. I gotta tell you something. I gotta tell someone. And you're the one I trust. - What is it? - I killed Duffy. I shot him and set his place on fire. He already killed a cop and he was going to kill me. I didn't want to. He tried to fight, but he couldn't. Duffy was right, I'll never be a real reporter. It should have been me instead of him. It was... It was my story, but... I didn't have the guts to get it. - Don't say that. You didn't have any choice. - Sorry about that. - T-cells are not being produced. Titer count is low. The bonds are different. The structure has changed. Debbie...I'm sorry, dear, but it's too late to save you. However, there's so much I can learn from you. Think of it, Debbie. You could be making major medical history. Future victims worldwide could owe their recoveries to you. Debbie, I envy you. Your life will really count for something. Since you are no longer of sound of mind, Debbie, I have made the decision for you. - I don't feel so hot. Looks like my leg. - Nobody's pussying out. - Who's pussying out? - You think you're bad, man? You ain't shit. Let's get trashed. Let's go. - This will hurt a little bit, but it will soon be over. - This is all such a nightmare. I just want to drop out and go home. - It'll be over soon. Debbie will be fine. - That tow truck driver was right. - About what? - It's a red-ass world. - That's why I wanted to be a reporter. So maybe I could do something about it. - How? - I figured that giving people the truth might help the good guys win. - You know, you're really special. - Not special enough to save Debbie. - I wish we knew how Debbie is. Let's go call. - There's no answer. Let's go. - I feel bad, man. I feel really bad. - Let's do it! Yeah! - Dr. Ethridge? - Debbie? - Dr. Ethridge? Oh. - Debbie? - Let's go. - Hey, bastard. - Hey, douche bag, where'd you get the costumes, goodwill? - You're trash, fucker. - Hey, great costume. - Friends, Romans, Countrymen, let us party. Get outta the way. Excuse me. - All right, thanks. - Did you see a beast girl go by here? - Pal, I've seen things you wouldn't believe go by. - You've gotta help us find her, she's dangerous. - Sure, I'll call the zoo. - Please. - Wherever you're on, don't let me see it. - What do we do now? - Keep looking. - Hey, what are you doing back there? Come out into the light. Oh, hi, how are ya? - Give me a kiss. I want to suck your blood. Hey, I was just kidding, man. - We're never gonna find her in this madhouse. - Let's split up. - Hey, where's your costume? - Oh, this is crazy. Run. Run. - Hi, puke. You're gonna love it! - Are you okay? It's okay. You all right? It's okay. It's all right. It'll be okay. It's fine. - I'm sorry, Debbie. I'm so sorry. - I'll take that. I'll be down in the car, okay? - Okay. - All right. Bye. - No! - Let's get outta here.
