Finally, we found the man, who jumped off the plane. Children, stay away! - Even a nigger longs for women. - Yes, because he's also a human being. Animals too get a hard on. Eat! Eat it! It's good! Stay away from him until we get an order from the prefecture headquarters. But we have to guard him, so that he doesn't run off. Look, the Americans allow such guys to fly their planes. Hey, enemy! We'll get all the secrets out of you! Let's put him into a cage like a pet. That'll be fun! Quiet, kids! Get me the keys. We'll lock him in my barn. That's a good idea! Your house is the biggest. Idiot! Who says, that I have to keep him? Then we should keep him in turns. Bullshit! We already hunted him down in the mountains for three days. And now we should put him up, too? Giving him a little water every day is enough. But when he snufffs it, we'll all be punished. Otherwise we'll get a letter of gratitude and a reward. Stop complaining! We need someone to look after him. No time! Let the women do that! Idiot! The nigger's a man. Hisako, what are you up to? You don't have to look after him. You will! No! No? But you take care of my wife... this monster all the time. You always care about her. Let me thank all of you for your effforts in the name of the village chief. Good night, Aunt. Don't stay here too long. Why? Because this is a hell. Nota place for young people. Your Uncle is a beast. He's having an affair with Hisako, my daughter-in-law. A real hell it is. Ma'm, I brought back the laundry. Aki, you look after the nigger? I didn't want to, but the master has ordered me. I don't want to be around anyone who has touched the nigger. Ma'm, please don't say that! I work at this house, because I'm really fond of serving you. Then promise that you'll never be friendly with the nigger. I don't want to take care of the nigger. Please, Ma'm, let me go on serving you. I'm very pleased that you agree. Wash this! Good night. Good night, Sir! Goat's milk. Drink it! Get out children! He won't drink it because you're watching. But we want to watch! No, I'm responsible for him! Drink! Drink first. Osamu, give this to the nigger. Stupid woman! Only the village chief and the prefectural authorities will make money with the nigger. Two kids are burden enough to me. And now a nigger on top of that! Unbearable! Isn't there an exemption for the families of serving soldiers. Father should have asked at the assembly. But all he does is drink from morning to night. Osamu, steal a couple of potatoes from the Chief's field. How many? You better not! Nobody will realize, if one or two potatoes are missing. If this is true, you could clear out the whole field. I'm goin' You'll start drinking again. Uncle, may I have a piece of the parachute? What for? I'll sew a kimono for myself. But you don't have any opportunity to wear it That doesn't matter. I only want to own one. Actually we should hand it in to the MP. But in the end the prefectural authorities will collect it anyway. Nobody will realize, if we take a part of it. We could say, that it burnt, and sell it in town. Tea! We could make a tidy sum with it. Another sake. How much more do you want to drink? That's none of your business. Good morning. What's the matter? I want to exchange this for some food. Well... How beautiful! It would really suit Hisako. Too flashy! People would say, that I'm showing off. I inherited it from my mother. Every evacuatee claims that. But it's true. I want to exchange it for some food for the prisoner. Okay then. Let's see. - Half a sack of rice. - Too much! I don't want them! I can't wear them anyway. But you will! Time will come, when we'll be allowed to wear kimonos again. Then we'll be able to return to Tokyo. Uncle, please buy them! Alright. Thank you very much! It's too much! Hisako, how stingy you are! We have to economize the family's resources. We're spending far too much. Was that meant for me? You've got it right. I have been a friend of this family long before you married into it. - What does this mean? - Enough! Denmatsu, stop it! Anyway, the sake doesn't taste good here anymore. This boy is the child of the Chief and my sister, who used to work in this house. He's like a child of this family. Here's another sake! Drink! No, thanks. Osamu, let's leave. Osamu, come here. Take some sweet potatoes and eat. Here, take another one. If you need help, please come again. I don't want to bother you, as long as I can make it myself. Next time, you don't need to bring something along. I'm glad, if I can help. Thank you, very much. I'll take you home. - No, thank you. You don't need to. - I'll carry it for you. No! Come on, getup. I'll help you. first: In case of an injury... foreign POWs must be treated politely. Second: the POW has to be guarded, until the MP arrives... so that he can't commit suicide... nmo escape. third: those, who infringe this order... will be punished. That's it. Appendix: those, who discover B-29 crews... or any other foreign soldiers... will be distinguished by their superiors... after their report. So, we must keep him? Yes, according to section 7457 of the police decree. That's ridiculous! Must we keep him for 6 months or even a year though? That would cost us a lot of money. But according to the decree, we should get a reward instead. It's only a piece of paper. We already sacrificed enough. There's nothing left to feed the nigger. Send it back! You want to violate the order? We'll all be severely punished. Let me see. There's nothing in it, that says, that I must keep the nigger in my barn. Doesn't that mean, that the authorities have to keep him? - Meaning the Chief is responsible. - Who usually acts all big, anyway. Well, if it wasn't an order but a favor asked of us, we would go along with it. Let's talk about it. Wouldn't it be a great honor for our village? We never gained anything, when we've been asked for help. We'll do without the honors. Send it back! Go, Clerk! What is it? You'll be punished, because you refused to obey the order. You should beg us formally for it. Herewith I beg you all politely. What shall we do? If the Chief wants it this way... ...and we are asked politely... Now, I'm relieved. Chief, because you are the leader of the biggest household... you can easily afford, to take care of the nigger. Idiot! Of course we will take turns. We'll get back what we've spent from the authorities. Or we'll withhold part of our dues. Tell this to the authorities. Agreed. Because you fell in love with the nigger... it was decided, that we'll keep him. He's an important prisoner. He must not escape. Is he a spy? Why? Is the nigger a spy? Very soon, the MP will beat him... to get information about the enemy. Until then, we'll take care of him. He'll die. What? His leg in the trap is beginning to rot. The wound became inflamed and festers. Shit! Hey, prisoner! Come here and show me your leg! Why don't you go inside yourself and lent him a hand? His leg is full of maggots. We're not responsible, if the nigger dies. Brat! You're talking shit! Okay. I order you to remove the trap! Brother. What are you doing? We let him to see the "origin of the world". Stop it! Lift your skirt! In front! Lift it! - Idiot! Not the backside! - Show him! Higher! Lift it higher! Higher, higher! Stop it! Who are you? She's the Chiefs niece. Get her out there. You mean, you prefer to show him yours? A B-29! Goddamn shit! Thiefs! Apologize, and we'll forgive you. Someone stole from us as well. These refugees are responsible. To the hungry all food is the same! Apologize, and we'll forget about it. They stole from us as well. But we had pity on them. We gave them a big rice dumpling. - You too? - Yes I guess, their mother sends them out to steal. Mom! I politely beg you pardon. Please forgive me. I didn't take care of them. Mrs. Ishii, your children are pretty naughty. They don't even apologize. Anyway! They're only children. From now on, they will behave better. I don't think so. A lot of people have had something stolen from them. If you let them live at your place... why don't you take better care of them? Mrs. Ishii, I constantly get complaints. You claim, that you can live from your rations without help. Sounds good. But, under these circumstances you shouldn't claim it no longer. As for you, I have to say, you cry out, that something has been stolen from you. But a lot of potatoes have been stolen from the Chiefs and my field as well. You want to say, that we steal, too? A lot more has been stolen than these three could ever eat. Yes, I think that some village people do steal, too. What? You claim, that some of us are thiefs? Tell us, who! Kadoya, you want to pin the blame on us. That's unbearable! What's all this noise about? It was only a prank. It's too hot for that. Wait a minute! Kadoya claims, that there are thiefs among us. - We have to find out, if it's true. - It is true! - Dummy! - Stop it! We blame it on the nigger. Report the stolen goods to me, and I will claim compensation from the authorities. Will the believe it? You can quarrel as much as you want, but nothing will come out of it! Agreed. We blame it on the nigger. I don't worry about the children. - Will they listen? - Alright, agreed. If we can handle it that way, it's fine with me. Let's go. Hey, nigger! Quit stealing my potatoes! What are you up to? Stop it! What are you doing with the nigger? We're showing him, how to plant rice. Idiots! What if he does a crap? This beast doesn't even think about it. Come here everyone! If a good-for-nothing like Jiro goes to war, it will soon be over. Why would the war be over? Hey, did you bring some sake? Yeah, plenty for tonight. The Chief supplied it! I wonder what this man thinks about us if he only gets to see rice-farmers? Hey, nigger! I plant rice to feed you. Look, my face has become as black as yours. Me, too, brother. The water is pleasantly cool. Dad, give me 5 bushels of rice. What for? I want to buy me a woman. Nonsense! I've heard, that the women in town cost five bushels. I can't give you 5, not even 3. I had to borrow half a sack from the Chief already. My heart can't win a woman. Mikiko, what are you doing here? Look, it'sTokyo. Tokyo's burning. This isn't Tokyo. It's another town. - I'm sure it's Tokyo. - No, it's not! - Not Tokyo. - It sure is. You Tokyo-idiots! Burn! Burn up! - Why did you say that? - Serves you right! Tokyo-idiots! Osamu, your mother's burning, too. Shit, Osamu's dumb mother! Brother, is my mother burning as well? Yes, because she's aTokyo-idiot. Shit! Serves you right! Burn! Tokyo-idiots, die! Stop singing! Let's move on. Yoichi, did you buy a woman for Jiro? I don't have the money! Too bad, Yoichi. Hey, Denmatsu. Now it's my turn. I can lend you a woman. Because we live in the era of the Great Japanese Empire now. Idiot! She's the wife of a fighting soldier. Exactly! Therefore it's her duty, to give a future soldier a pleasurable night. Hey, go home, take a bath and wait for him. Don't go! Denmatsu would have you in his grip for the rest of your life. Of course, he would owe me something. But not for the rest of his entire life! If Jiro, this loser, would go to war, he wouldn't survive for two days. I won't die! Listen, Jiro. The reason Denmatsu can blackmail the Chief is... Yoichi, shut your trap! Hey, cut it out! Three cheers for Mr. Kokubo Jiro! Hey, come in, Clerk. My dear Ladies and Gents, it seems, as if you're enjoying yourselves. Yes, we have a lot of fun. We've heard, that Tokyo's burning. Despite that, we celebrate. It wasn't Tokyo! Then it must have been the HQ of the prefectural Administration. Then, there'd be no more MP. Despite that, Jiro has to go to war tomorrow. That's absurd! Jiro, don't go! If Tokyo has been destroyed, the war would be over anyway. You idiots! Even if Tokyo would have been destroyed, Japan would go on fighting to the last man. His Majesty, the Emperor, Supreme Commander of the Army... has moved to an air-raid shelter in the near-by mountains. If the MP is no more, we've kept the nigger in vain. No, not in vain! We should have killed him immediately! The authorities betrayed us! Haven't you been distinguished for exemplary behaviour? No, we've been only been praised for it. There were no compensation for what we've spent on the nigger. That's a big loss for us. If the MP can't sort it out, the prefectural administration has to step in. Right! Right! Then we don't hand in our rice this year. Right! You greedy bastards! How is Japan to win this war with this kind of attitude? Jiro, don't listen to these bastards. Fight well as a soldier in the Emperor's army. Well, even if I'd loose a leg, I'd never become like you. Idiot! What are you talking about? Hurray! Allright, I have to leave now. But I think that you're still thirsty. I brought two bottles of good sake for you. That's what we expected. Jiro, drink as much as you like. But tomorrow morning you have to leave. Damn! Whenever he wants to fool us he treats us to sake. Hey, Mrs Ishii, let's drink together, because your husband has been killed. Drink to the fact, that you're a widow now. - I'll go home. My children are waiting. - Forget about the children! Don't worry about them. They will steal something, when they get hungry. But you forgave them, didn't you? We forgive robbers, beggars and niggers and allow them to stay. It's only fair then, that we keep you, too. I understand, you're sad, because your husband died. My husband didn't die! Stop teasing her! - Such a beautiful woman... ... doesn't suit you. She the Chiefs lover. It's true. Come, come. Quit this talking. These guys always have to tease the refugees. Right, Mrs. Ishii? Hey, Clerk! This isn't settled yet! What do you mean? The nigger? Exactly! It's your duty to keep him. Greedy bastards. Damn, rambling. They made you clerk only because you lost your leg. So stop talking big. Before that, you were working as a kitchen-aid and water-bearer for the Chief because you couldn't find a better job! Shut up! That's long ago! That's why I hate tenant-farmers. I don't give a damn. Tomorrow you must decide what will happen with the nigger. Otherwise I'll bind him on your back. What are you worrying about? And don't try to cheat us. Alright. You're really a bunch of suspicious people. Hey, you were no virgin. I don't care. I have... I had a lover in Tokyo. How curious! A recruitment ceremony without recruits is impossible! Without recruits, but with banners. How funny! I was suspicious about the nigger from the beginning. The nigger is to blame for everything. Why? I guess, you know, for why my brother disappeared. You were with him last night, weren't you? What are you talking about? Tell the truth! I have no idea. Liar! The idiot fled, because he's afraid to die. Nothing but excuses. I'll tell everybody what happened. Okay, my brother slept with you. Hachiro, idiot! You must not tell anybody. - Mikiko, what kind of girl are you? - She ain't no girl no more. Bastard! I'll see, that you're banned from the village. Aunt, that's none of your business. We have been cheated. Your Holiness, foxgod Toy, okawa Inari from Mikawa Your Holiness, badger-god, if you can hear me, show yourself! Why did Hachiro's brother disappear? Negro NE... GRO You always care about the nigger. I'm fed up with him. I won't stay in this family. You clean out the nigger's dung. The nigger is responsible, for your brother's disappearing. Die! Die! Idiot! Dummy! Stop it! Damn! You're an idiot! Shit! Damn shit! Cut it out! Damn shit! Wash yourself. Are you angry with me? Don't bother me! But I'm on your side, no matter what the village says. On my side? I want to help you. Okay, then tell everybody, that my brother disappeared because of you. I'm not responsible. Who is then? The nigger. Everybody says that. The nigger ain't responsible. Quit it! Mikiko, what are you doing there? Nothing. You told my brother to hide. Don't! He'll stop talking. I will! I'll repeat it over and over again: The Chiefs niece slept with... Don't leave me! What are you talking about? You visit this woman in the middle of the night. Nonsense! Liar! I'd rather die, but help this woman. You're talking nonsense. What are you laughing about? This is a hellish timel. I'll write a letter to Yoshima my sonm. Even if he returns healthy, his wife has become a beast. Idiot! Stop it! My hand... it hurts! My hand... You all looked away. Yoichi! If you don't obey, I'll send you to Tokyo. Sir... Ma'm, it's not your wife's fault. A hell! Quit it! I'll kill him! You wanted to kill him. Now, go ahead! Shit! What tare you doing? Why do you stop? He doesn't want to beat him. Miss, please let him goon. Don't beat him! Stop it! Hatchiro, stop it! Stop! Hachiro, stop! Why? Mrs Ishii, the nigger only tried to save his life. He didn't push herdown deliberately. The beast has betrayed you again. If we had killed him, it would have never happened. We have to inform the authorities. What do you think, Chief? Do you want to be cheated by the authorities, again? It's a waste of time. What do you mean? He's our enemy. If we'd killed him immediately, this wouldn't have happened. If we go to the authorities, we all have to agree. Let's kill him! - Right! - Shoot him! But we can't decide on our own. The authorities will call on us to account for it. Then, the Chief must decide. The nigger is kept in his barn. If you feel like it, you can roast and cook him. Or sell his black meat in town. Kill him! Let me do it! Stop it! I want to kill him! May I say something? The nigger is responsible, too, that Jiro fled. This is the only way to see it, right? No, Jiro didn't flee, because of the nigger. What? What do you mean? - It's not because of the nigger, that... - Nonsense! A child like you has no business being here. Come on! What kind of assembly is this? Bureaucratic idiot! What shall we do with the nigger? What have you been up to, again? A child died. It happened, because you bureaucratic idiots didn't decide. That's the reason, why I came. Now, what did they decide? As we suspected, the MP headquarters has been hit. You have tot take the nigger to town. But, if he dies on the way, the authorities will send someone to get his corpse. Idiots! Why do they decide like this? They told us before, that the nigger has important information and that we'll be distinguished. How about this now? Because the MP doesn't exist anymore... The authorities are responsible! They forced me to keep the nigger. They are responsible for the death of the child. I only acted on orders. To our disadvantage. Such an explanation isn't enough. As you know, I'm only a messenger. In addition, an offical letter for Denmatsu arrived today. For me? Please read it. Tsukada Matsuo has died heroically in Okinawa. I know exactly how you must feel. I always have to deliver bad news to you. Let's pray silently for the soul of the fallen hero. Let's pray together. In silence we pray for the heroic soul of Tsukada Matsuo who died for our Majesty the Emperor on the battleground. Let us pray! Goddamn! Why did you have to die? Masu, how shall we get a long without you? We already pulled out the weeds. But we still have to bring in the rice and the wheat. And how shall we make it next year? Tell us! Will we be on all fours in the paddies again? I'm so tired. Tell us, stupid! I can't help, but complain. Keep quiet, old woman! Mrs Masu, I know very well how you feel, but your son died as a hero. It was his fate. I... I want to complain to you. While you cared too much about the nigger, my son died on the battlefield. Because you all cared too much about him. She's right! He brings nothing but disaster upon us. Why do we keep him? Only reluctantly. Only because of this bureaucratic idiot! Liar! The Chief kept him, because he hoped to be rewarded by the MP. It was him. He's responsible! Say that again! I was forced to keep the nigger. And despite that, I'm blamed now. Don't talk rubbish! You claim that you kept him for the sake of the nation? Would you believe it? Our noble Chief did something fort he sake of the nation. Idiot! What are you talking about? Don't touch my wife! This beast! You must kill the nigger! We have to sufffer, because the Chief keeps this animal. She's right! The Chief is a shark! You blockhead of a servant you call my wife an idiot? Denmatsu! You're drinking my sake for free. And you always get another bottle, when you go home. How can you call me a shark? It's not only me. Everybody says so. You keep the nigger for the same reason you're supplying me with sake: calculation Denmatsu, why are you so pert. Pert? I'm pert? I just lost my only son in the war. I know, but the Chief has nothing to do with that. So what's all this fuss about? Fuss? How do you talk with the bereaved? We'll get back 3 times as much as we spent on the nigger. Didn't he says so? Yes, he did. He cheated me, too. Give it back, Chief! May I say... What's all this talk about? ...that it would help us a lot. At least until the next harvest. I agree. Idiots! I won't help you out again, with the way you talk about me. Help yourself! The Chief is rich! Right. In this warehouse he keeps the nigger. But in that one, over there, he stockpiles food-supplies. - He could easily distribute them among us. - Stop this! Actually, it's our rice that we had to deliver to him. What are you getting so worked up about? This would exactly suit the purpose of the enemy. This beast would laugh up his sleeve, because it would successfully destroy the unity of the 100 mio. Idlers! I'll never... Stop fighting. You good-for-nothings! If you can't, I'll kill the nigger single-handedly. I'm not afraid! I'll cut off his head! Let's go! I'll load the rifle. Let's kill him! Listen! Afterwards I'll divide the rice among you. But right now, the most important task is to kill the nigger, to end the discord between us. We let him escape to the mountains. Hey, you rascals! What are you doing there inside? We need a stick! Hurry up! Hachiro! Hachiro! Osamu, take away that stick! Osamu, idiot! Take it! Rascal, what are you doing? Hachiro! Don't shoot! I can't! Osamu, move away from the nigger, you idiot! Do you hear me? Be a good boy. Move away. Listen to me! Osamu! Osamu, stay close to the nigger! Bastard! Osamu, do you hear me? Stay close to him! Can you hear me? Answer! I can hear you! I'll stay close to him! What's going on? Who's responsible for this? Chief, an amateur like you won't make it! Attention! Quit it! I need another cartridge. You hate Osamu that much? Nonsense! I know you well! You hate Osamu so deeply, you'd be able to kill him. Stupid! That's rubbish! I'll repeat it, anyway. Osamu is your own child. My sister has borne him for you. That's why you hate him so much. This is one of Denmatsu's false accusations. Liar! When my sister worked for you at your house... you made her pregnant. But you blamed your servant, back then... and drove both away to Tokyo. But Osamu is your child! Nothing, but rumors. Where's the evidence? Denmatsu, why don't you say something? Stupid! Stop talking! You're mixing up a lot of things. Stupid old man. His money and his sake have muzzled you. Goddamn, I'm telling the truth! Shut up! She's telling the truth. I've seen it with my own eyes. It happened here in the warehouse, where the nigger is kept. He raped that woman. I've seen it myself. Madwoman! Go back home! Masu tells the truth. It was my idea to send them toTokyo. Get lost! The world is a hell. You bitch! Beat it! Mrs Masu... come with me! I... I honestly wanted to marry your sister. Liar! No, I'm not lying. But I can understand if you don't believe me' I wanted to get rid of that lunatic, and marry your sister. Why didn't you do it, then? My assets didn't allow for it. If I had married your sister, I would have become head of your family. It would have ruined me. That's just splitting hairs. Oyoshi gave herself to me, because she was after my money. Look at your husband. For ten years now, he lives at my expenmse. For ten years, I've endured that he drinks my sake. What's ten years of your endurance, compared to the fate of my sister-in-law. You made me adipso. I have urgent business in town, and must return early. Farewell. Help me. What are you up to? I'm breaking the door open and taking him prisoner. What will happen to my Osamu? What will happen to him, if nothing is done? What will the nigger do? If we don't try, we'll never know. If nobody wants to join in, I'll do it alone. Don't open! Stay out! Don't touch the door! Stop it! No, don' tworry about it! Carry on! Or I... I won't allow you to bury this in my field. But the assembly decided it. I don't talk with you. What would you do with him? I won't endure, that his corpse sullies my field. Dump him on the other side of the mountain. Rubbish! Getaway! Away, away... out of the way. Does it still hurt? It's only stinging a bit. Really? Away! Get lost! I had no choice. I don't want my field to be sullied by a monster like this nigger. Get her out of the way! It feels curious, to bury someone without ceremony. It's only for a short time, until the authorities fetch him. I know. But is it okay, to bury him like that? At least we should recite a sutra. We'll bury him with military honors because he died as a soldier. We killed an enemy. When a man dies, even an enemy soldier becomes a buddha. So it doesn't mattter. Three cheers to His Majesty, the Emperor! Hurray! Hurray! Hey, what are you doing there? Shut up, or we'll bury you, too. The war... the war is over! What? The war is over! I listened to the Emperor's speech on the radio. And I came here straight away. His Majesty, the Emperor spoke. Really? We shall end the war. I didn't understand it but the principal explained it. Stupid! Aren't you a veteran of war? The war can't end without Japan's victory. But the Emperor has acknowledged the Potsdam Treaty. Therefore the war is over. Really? What are we supposed todo now? What will happen? I don't know. I believe the Emperor will decide about that soon. Defeat. Japan has lost the war. How do you know? I don't understand: our life hasn't changed. What does "defeat" mean, then? It's possible, that we lost. That's weird. They always told us, that we must fight to the last man. The "final battle" on the main island. How can they say then, that we lost. Let's forget the nigger. Let's forget him, as if he'd never existed. I believe, it would be the best for all of us. What do you think? It's easy for me to forget him. Yesterday the prefectural administration released an order. We must hand in all our weapons to the occupation forces. The Americans suspect that we are deceitful criminals who will resist. If they'll find out about the nigger, something terrible could happen to us. Hey, wait a minute. What did we do to the nigger? We fed him potatoes. We gave him our best rice and even the goat's milk. How then can anybody accuse us of hurrting him? - But the nigger is dead. - You gave the order. You killed him. We kept him because you ordered it. We killed him because you told us: "Do what you like." I see. Go ahead, explain this to a tribunal. Of course, we could justify ourselves in front of any tribunal. War duties... Our young men, send away to fight... Heroes, who died for the Fatherland... If we'd obeyed without resistance you'd have completely fleeced us. We can justify ourselves. Then it'll be obvious who the real culprits are. Even if we'd try to consign it to oblivion, we couldn't prevent rumours. Right. We couldn't trust each other. I already have forgotten it. I've never seen the nigger. Although you're a friend of rumors. All I know is that I have seen nothing. So, we agree upon, that nothing unusual has happened in our village. That's what I will explain to the authorities. So, it's definite. Explain it to the women and children, too. Let's shake hands on it. Shake on it! Once more! Again! Thank you very much for your effforts. Mrs Ishii, this decision applies to you, too. I wanted to thank all of you, for the help that you granted me. All refugees should return toTokyo, or go to hell. I don't care! Allright. Let's eat and drink. When will the dinner be served? Did you understand everything? Let's spend all the Chiefs money on drinking today. Now, that peace has arrived. So let's drink together in peace and harmony. What are you doing? Stop it! It's all over. Come in. The authorities decided that you're innocent. Don't worry. - I guess you had a hard time. - Come in and drink with us. We just discussed it and decided, that everything that happened during the war never happened. That includes everything about the nigger and you. So, you don't have to worry about it. The war is over. Peace has arrived. Jiro, you not only have a big body, but a lot of courage, too. I admire you, how you hid all that time. If we'd ask you, todo it again... would you be able to? I'm really good on hiding, even if I have to live on roots. Could you do it again? When the Americans arrive, to investigate, we'll let Jiro hide again. Good idea! We blame everything on Jiro. And if he hides, we don't have to worry about the Americans. Wait, wait a minute! - Why must Jiro... - Listen. We ask Jiro for this favor because we trust him. I don't get it. Don't worry about it. We only ask you if the worst comes tothe worst. Yoiji, though we had a lot of trouble, because Jiro disappeared, we only request this help, if the worst happens. Drink. Jiro, if all the village people would beg you, would you do it? Well, if everybody demands it, I'll do it. I'd be very grateful. Jiro is a true village member. In the name of the village, I want to thank you. Okay, drink, another one! You're too brave, to be the Chiefs niece. The nigger sang a song. He bathed with us. And he ate our potatoes as well. And he got the shits from them. Your family has suffered terribly, but still you... Jiro and me have to stay in this village for years. You still didn't return to Tokyo. Did you wait for me? You shouldn't have returned. They all cheated you. I'm not that stupid. They can't cheat me. I'm too clever. Quit-acting so self-important! Wanna cheat me? I'm a soldier of the lmperial Army. I won't allow you to be imprudent. A coward like you. Shut up! You insult me? You blockhead! I've cutup 5 to 10 of these Chinese slit-eyes, once. - I won't endure any insults! - Interesting! Jiro, don't let the clerk get to you. Hitback. Jiro! Jiro! I won't hide! It's allright. We'll reconsider our decision. So, please turn down that sword. Who killed the nigger? You? Or you? - Or did the clerk do it? - The authorities ordered it. Jiro! Who killed him? Or doyou want to blame it on me? Jiro! You? The Chief... the Chief did it! The Chief? You killed the nigger? Apologize! Hold still! Kill, kill him! Stop it, Jiro! Jiro! Shut up! - Jiro! - Shut up! Jiro, quit it! The authorities ordered it. You must be joking. Jiro! This is not Jiro. Jiro didn't return, since he deserted from the army. We blame the nigger's death on him. If everybody else agrees on that, I'm for it as well. The most important thing is, that it goes off smoothly. I believe, that Yoiji will agree as well. Let's ignite it! Come on! All right, let's toast to it! We've finished a tiresome task. Yes, let's drive out the evil demons. I thank you all very much for your efforts. The same to you. It won't be to your disadvantage. We could give you a rice-paddy. Everything is settled to everyone's satisfaction. Let's prepare the Thanksgiving Festival now. We didn't celebrate for two years because of the war. That calls for a big celebration this year. We'll perform the Lion's Dance. Yoiji, come here. Dance with us.
