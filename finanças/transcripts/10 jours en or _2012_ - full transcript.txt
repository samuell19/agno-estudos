‪Department stores are new for us‬ ‪and this is a special line.‬ ‪It's the first two-part sock‬ ‪that's stylish and warm.‬ ‪The inside's thicker.‬ ‪It's new and patented.‬ ‪So it needs to stand out, see?‬ ‪We had a deal, you know:‬ ‪a ten-day promo on an aisle end.‬ ‪Someone here promised that.‬ ‪Yes, but we...‬ ‪I don't care.‬ ‪Just put the shirts away.‬ ‪How will I hit my target‬ ‪without an aisle end display?‬ ‪OK. I'll get rid of it all.‬ ‪Thanks.‬ ‪Did you really get a deal‬ ‪for an aisle end display?‬ ‪You've got a mark there.‬ ‪Sorry!‬ ‪Hey, hang on! What the...?‬ ‪What's your problem?‬ ‪Oh, it's you, Souleyman.‬ ‪-Is there a problem?‬ ‪-Have you seen a girl?‬ ‪Black, average build, around 30?‬ ‪Cute?‬ ‪OK, I'll help you look.‬ ‪It's OK, they've gone.‬ ‪I didn't steal it!‬ ‪I swear I didn't.‬ ‪Look, I'm not lying.‬ ‪I believe you.‬ ‪I know it's because you're cute.‬ ‪They're chasing you‬ ‪because you're cute. That's how it is.‬ ‪Excuse me.‬ ‪Marc Bajau.‬ ‪Mr Pérez, I'll call you right back.‬ ‪That was work.‬ ‪Can I ask you your name?‬ ‪Marie.‬ ‪It's not often‬ ‪I get locked in a toilet.‬ ‪Not so soon, anyway.‬ ‪-Sorry, I...‬ ‪-No.‬ ‪Don't worry about it.‬ ‪You might think I'm crazy,‬ ‪but I don't believe in chance;‬ ‪everything happens for a reason.‬ ‪I leave tomorrow,‬ ‪but tonight I'm at the Powers Hotel,‬ ‪in rue François Premier.‬ ‪Room 25.‬ ‪So if I can help in any way...‬ ‪Oh, and by the way,‬ ‪on your left as you go out‬ ‪there's a door to the car park.‬ ‪The gate will be open now.‬ ‪Mr Pérez? It's Marc Bajau.‬ ‪I'm sorry, I was with a customer.‬ ‪At the stand?‬ ‪I see you. I'm on my way.‬ ‪Surprised?‬ ‪I came from Lille this morning.‬ ‪A trip to the battleground.‬ ‪Have you got a minute?‬ ‪The manager's provided us‬ ‪with an office,‬ ‪I'd like to go over some things‬ ‪with you.‬ ‪If I want us to stay competitive,‬ ‪I'm obliged to cut costs.‬ ‪Some of your colleagues‬ ‪have already gone.‬ ‪What are you trying to say?‬ ‪That I'm halving your sales profits‬ ‪and capping your expenses forthwith.‬ ‪Are you joking?‬ ‪The competition would snap me up.‬ ‪Don't be so sure.‬ ‪I might be tempted to give them‬ ‪certain information about you.‬ ‪I've checked, Bajau.‬ ‪Every time you go anywhere,‬ ‪your expenses are huge.‬ ‪Right...‬ ‪Sit down!‬ ‪You can't have it both ways:‬ ‪either you accept my terms‬ ‪and I'll turn a blind eye to...‬ ‪Or you refuse.‬ ‪And I'll fire you.‬ ‪I knew we'd come to an agreement.‬ ‪I guess you've made arrangements‬ ‪for tonight,‬ ‪so that's OK.‬ ‪But from tomorrow,‬ ‪you'll change your expensive habits.‬ ‪Start with that shirt.‬ ‪It looks untidy.‬ ‪Have a good trip!‬ &lrm;The main haulage unions &lrm;are threatening &lrm;to block motorways and refineries. &lrm;The situation recalls that of 1995, &lrm;when the country was paralyzed &lrm;for weeks... ‪Sorry, I...‬ ‪It's a bad time.‬ ‪Not at all!‬ ‪I didn't thank you before.‬ ‪I'm not used to people being nice.‬ ‪And since you said...‬ ‪Come in.‬ ‪I won't be a minute.‬ ‪Marie?‬ ‪Perfect.‬ ‪"The other one is in my room,‬ ‪number 12."‬ ‪Absolutely perfect.‬ ‪Hello.‬ ‪Shit!‬ ‪Marie?‬ ‪Are you there, Marie?‬ ‪Is this yours?‬ ‪Shall we go?‬ ‪Where to?‬ ‪"5, rue du Puits, Gassin."‬ ‪What the hell's going on?‬ ‪What's your name?‬ ‪Lucas.‬ ‪OK, Lucas. I'm Mark.‬ ‪Is Marie your mum?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪Where is she?‬ ‪Gone.‬ ‪She said a well-dressed man‬ ‪would come for his shoe‬ ‪and take me to Daddy Clément‬ ‪at the seaside.‬ ‪-Is that your address?‬ ‪-Yes.‬ ‪She left very early‬ ‪and paid in cash.‬ ‪Nadine booked her in.‬ ‪I didn't see any kid...‬ ‪Are you blaming me?‬ ‪No, not at all.‬ ‪Here's your receipt.‬ ‪What's wrong?‬ ‪You want me to add a bit?‬ ‪No thanks.‬ ‪I'm not taking it, actually.‬ ‪What'll you do with the kid?‬ ‪His address is on his bag:‬ ‪in the suburbs.‬ ‪I'll just take him home.‬ ‪He seems harmless enough.‬ ‪You really don't know the girl?‬ ‪Have you seen him?‬ ‪I'm a bit more pale-faced!‬ ‪Yes, he's mixed-race.‬ ‪If his mother is black,‬ ‪his father must be...‬ ‪Am I the only white guy‬ ‪in the world?‬ ‪No, he's not mine.‬ ‪I'm not crazy, OK?‬ ‪What have you done?‬ ‪Here, put your arm underneath.‬ ‪Go on.‬ ‪That's it.‬ &lrm;Enter your destination. ‪What's a pale-face?‬ ‪A pale-face?‬ ‪Someone who needs a holiday.‬ &lrm;You have arrived. ‪Hurry up.‬ ‪Come on! Let's go!‬ ‪Is this where you live?‬ ‪Can you show me where you live?‬ ‪Is this it?‬ ‪Marie?‬ ‪DEPORTATION ORDER‬ ‪Oh shit.‬ ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪Don't touch that!‬ ‪Where's your mum?‬ ‪What's up with you?‬ ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪I'm clearing up, aren't I?‬ ‪And anyway, who are you?‬ ‪What do you want? Are you a cop?‬ ‪I'm a friend.‬ ‪I'm looking for his mum.‬ ‪Let me know if you find her.‬ ‪She owes me two months' rent.‬ ‪I warned her,‬ ‪I'm clearing up and re-letting.‬ ‪Where did she go?‬ ‪I don't care.‬ ‪I just don't want trouble, OK?‬ ‪-Police!‬ ‪-Open up!‬ ‪Open this door.‬ ‪This one.‬ ‪Open up! Police!‬ ‪Open these doors.‬ ‪This one too.‬ ‪Nothing here.‬ ‪Mr Pérez, perfect timing!‬ ‪No, I'm just setting off...‬ ‪Gauthier? I know him.‬ ‪Why? Have you fired him?‬ ‪His wife had a baby, not him!‬ ‪It's on my way, but his sector is...‬ ‪OK, I'll sort something out.‬ ‪Yes, I understand.‬ ‪Right. OK.‬ ‪Goodbye, Mr Pérez.‬ ‪Right,‬ ‪you can come.‬ ‪But you have to be good,‬ ‪do as I say without arguing,‬ ‪and no tantrums, OK?‬ ‪Where you do think my mummy is?‬ ‪I don't know.‬ ‪She must have gone on a trip.‬ ‪Yes, she's gone on a trip.‬ ‪Is that a TV?‬ ‪No, it's a satnav.‬ ‪What games can you play on it?‬ ‪It's not a game.‬ ‪It's for seeing where we're going.‬ ‪No, don't touch it!‬ ‪It's hot. It's very hot.‬ ‪It'll burn you.‬ ‪Won't it burn you as well?‬ ‪No, not me.‬ ‪Don't talk when I'm driving, OK?‬ ‪I need to concentrate,‬ ‪so no questions, OK?‬ ‪Do you understand?‬ ‪Hello.‬ ‪Clean your windscreen?‬ ‪Tyre pressure?‬ ‪Oil and water?‬ ‪No, thank you.‬ ‪Is that your kid?‬ ‪Why?‬ ‪Oh, not because he's...‬ ‪I mean...‬ ‪You always let him sit up front?‬ ‪No, sometimes the boot, or the roof.‬ ‪Yes, very funny.‬ ‪Normally kids go in the back,‬ ‪on a booster seat, you know?‬ ‪Have a nice day.‬ ‪And Merry Christmas!‬ ‪Jean-Christophe, it's Marc.‬ ‪I'm coming as Gauthier's given birth.‬ ‪His wife has.‬ ‪Pérez asked me to pick up his sector‬ ‪before Christmas.‬ ‪Good job some of us‬ ‪are responsible, eh?‬ ‪OK. See you later.‬ ‪Where's your bag?‬ ‪Your bag with your clothes in?‬ ‪What'll we do with no clean clothes?‬ ‪You must look after your stuff!‬ ‪-How old are you anyway?‬ ‪-Six.‬ ‪Well, you're not a baby anymore.‬ ‪Oh, this is disgusting...‬ ‪Couldn't you say you felt sick?‬ ‪It's not hard!‬ ‪You said not to talk‬ ‪while you were driving.‬ ‪Get in!‬ ‪Stay there, don't move, OK?‬ ‪Play with that. I'll be quick.‬ ‪Then we'll go buy‬ ‪something to wear, OK?‬ ‪Be good, OK?‬ ‪I have to talk to the lady,‬ ‪then I'll be back.‬ ‪He's very cute.‬ ‪He looks like you, I think.‬ ‪He's got your eyes.‬ ‪Well, I mean...‬ ‪they're the same shape.‬ ‪Here's the flyers‬ ‪for the competition and promo.‬ ‪Customers spending over 60 euros‬ ‪get a free gift.‬ ‪Make sure they're visible.‬ ‪And show off the new styles more.‬ ‪And at the same time,‬ ‪it all needs some sprucing up...‬ ‪So, your colleague, Gauthier,‬ ‪who usually comes,‬ ‪how long are you replacing him for?‬ ‪Just once, I hope.‬ ‪At least...‬ ‪I think so.‬ ‪Now, the figures?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪Sorry.‬ ‪Have a nice evening.‬ ‪Yes, hello.‬ ‪Can I speak to Clément Rozière,‬ ‪please?‬ ‪He's not there.‬ ‪No, I'll call back another time.‬ ‪Thanks.‬ ‪Forget it, it's not your size!‬ ‪What? You seen a ghost?‬ ‪Your boss said I can sleep down here‬ ‪if I lag it before 6am.‬ ‪"Leg it", you mean.‬ ‪"Leg it", "Leg over", you get it,‬ ‪that's the main thing.‬ ‪How about a drink to warm me up?‬ ‪You don't look very cold.‬ ‪Appearances can be deceptive!‬ ‪Cigarette?‬ ‪No thanks, I've given up.‬ ‪I used to smoke like a chippy.‬ ‪A chimney.‬ ‪Yeah, I meant like a chimney.‬ ‪I get words mixed up sometimes.‬ ‪Always have.‬ ‪My mouth's faster than my brain.‬ ‪Don't you smoke?‬ ‪Why the fags, then?‬ ‪To light a girl's cigarette for her,‬ ‪like they do in films?‬ ‪That's stupid!‬ ‪No, it's just if you've stopped,‬ ‪I don't want to tempt you.‬ ‪Oh right.‬ ‪So what shall we drink to?‬ ‪Rain? Winter? Full hotels?‬ ‪To chance.‬ ‪And the nice surprises it brings.‬ ‪The worst thing is‬ ‪that I bet your bullshit works.‬ ‪I know how you barmen‬ ‪fancy yourselves.‬ ‪I've met a few.‬ ‪So, are you just passing through?‬ ‪Oh, you're so formal!‬ ‪Is this all part of your spiel?‬ ‪Are you trying to sweeten me up?‬ ‪Are you just crashing overnight?‬ ‪Every hotel-goer is, aren't they?‬ ‪I'm going to Italy.‬ ‪Hitchhiking.‬ ‪That's pretty far.‬ ‪I like it, taking my time,‬ ‪being on the road, all that.‬ ‪It's my thing.‬ ‪What's that smell?‬ ‪I think your knickers are on fire.‬ ‪Shit!‬ ‪You haven't even drunk your drink!‬ ‪You think I'm easy because I'm ugly?‬ ‪Is that it?‬ ‪No, you're not ugly.‬ ‪You're great, you're very...‬ ‪Very undressed. But not very stupid.‬ ‪Right, I need to finish my washing.‬ ‪I'm off early tomorrow.‬ ‪Thanks.‬ ‪My name's Marc.‬ ‪What about you?‬ ‪Hang on,‬ ‪how many girls have you seen here,‬ ‪just passing through,‬ ‪give them a drink‬ ‪hoping to jump them?‬ ‪I don't work here.‬ ‪You said looks can be deceptive.‬ ‪OK, right.‬ ‪Julie.‬ ‪I'm heading south tomorrow,‬ ‪for work.‬ ‪If you'd like a lift...‬ ‪Goodnight, Julie.‬ ‪Can you leave the light on?‬ ‪You're still dressed.‬ ‪Come on, take that off.‬ ‪Come along!‬ ‪Lift your arms up.‬ ‪Help me out, here.‬ ‪What's that?‬ ‪It's an amulet.‬ ‪Mu mummy gave it to me.‬ ‪It's for good luck.‬ ‪Right, well, keep it on.‬ ‪Right.‬ ‪We may as well do some washing, too.‬ ‪Here,‬ ‪take the soap, put some on‬ ‪your hands and rub hard, OK?‬ ‪And don't move, OK?‬ ‪I'll be back in a minute.‬ ‪Are you sure you're six?‬ ‪A small six, then.‬ ‪Same as yesterday.‬ ‪You stay here, OK?‬ ‪I'll be keeping an eye on you. OK?‬ ‪I don't want any more.‬ ‪There. OK? I'll be right back.‬ ‪Are you lost?‬ ‪Have you seen Santa Claus?‬ ‪No.‬ ‪What's your name?‬ ‪Lucas.‬ ‪Where's your mummy?‬ ‪She's gone away on a trip.‬ ‪But I mustn't be sad‬ ‪and mustn't try to find her.‬ ‪OK, great. Thank you.‬ ‪Excuse me, do you work here?‬ ‪If needs be.‬ ‪But I'm not for sale, sorry!‬ ‪I don't know my boyfriend's size‬ ‪in underwear.‬ ‪Is he tall? Muscly?‬ ‪Compared to me?‬ ‪A bit less.‬ ‪Tall?‬ ‪No, muscly.‬ ‪MAN Size four should fit.‬ ‪Why not socks as well?‬ ‪These new MAN ones have two parts.‬ ‪They're warm and stylish.‬ ‪Baggy thick socks round your ankles‬ ‪in winter aren't...‬ ‪The inside's thicker in these.‬ ‪It's new and patented. Here.‬ &lrm;Lucas is waiting for the well-dressed &lrm;man at customer services. &lrm;I repeat, &lrm;Lucas is waiting for the well-dressed &lrm;man at customer services. ‪Lucas!‬ ‪What did I say? Huh?‬ ‪Not to move!‬ ‪Is this your son?‬ ‪I just thought... since he's...‬ ‪I was expecting someone more...‬ ‪I mean a bit less...‬ ‪Less pale?‬ ‪It's winter.‬ ‪Anyway,‬ ‪thanks for bringing him back.‬ ‪-My pleasure.‬ ‪-What's that?‬ ‪It's to play cowboys.‬ ‪No cowboys. OK?‬ ‪We'll leave it here.‬ ‪Now let's go!‬ ‪Hey, we had a deal,‬ ‪don't you remember?‬ ‪No tantrums.‬ ‪Stop it!‬ ‪It's my fault.‬ ‪We passed‬ ‪the toy section earlier, so...‬ ‪I bought him a present.‬ ‪You buy guns for kids?‬ ‪It's just a toy.‬ ‪-Say thanks to Mr...‬ ‪-Mr Pierre.‬ ‪Thank you, Mr Pierre.‬ ‪Merry Christmas.‬ ‪Thanks a lot.‬ ‪I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...‬ ‪I don't live far,‬ ‪could you give me a lift?‬ ‪I'm a bit loaded up,‬ ‪and it's cold, isn't it?‬ ‪It'd be great.‬ ‪You'd do me a real favour.‬ ‪Well...‬ ‪I brought your little boy back...‬ ‪Do you know Didier Drogba?‬ ‪The name rings a bell.‬ ‪Is he a football player?‬ ‪He's my favourite.‬ ‪The boy says‬ ‪you're going to the seaside?‬ ‪Yes, to Marseille.‬ ‪Ah, the south!‬ ‪Sunshine, boats,‬ ‪travel...‬ ‪For my wife,‬ ‪the south was everything.‬ ‪She was born and grew up there.‬ ‪Do you have family there?‬ ‪Is this the way?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪Thank you very much.‬ ‪It was very kind of you to bring me.‬ ‪Very kind indeed.‬ ‪Happy to help.‬ ‪You're lucky‬ ‪to have a little boy like that.‬ ‪They change your life, children.‬ ‪But no booster seat?‬ ‪Seats and boosters for children.‬ ‪I know.‬ ‪It's in his mother's car.‬ ‪You know women.‬ ‪Oh yes. It's not easy.‬ ‪Anyway, I need to be somewhere.‬ ‪I've got to go.‬ ‪Have a nice day.‬ ‪Have a nice day.‬ ‪Where are we going now?‬ ‪To another shop.‬ ‪He forgot his bag!‬ ‪Shit, shit, shit!‬ ‪Shit, shit, shit!‬ ‪We'd better take it up then.‬ ‪Is it here?‬ ‪Come on!‬ ‪No, Lucas...‬ ‪Lucas!‬ ‪How much have you drunk?‬ ‪You've brought my bag back.‬ ‪That's so kind!‬ ‪You're a good little boy, you know.‬ ‪It's a sign.‬ ‪A what?‬ ‪A sign.‬ ‪Has Isabelle arrived? Right.‬ ‪Has she had time to prepare‬ ‪her figures, targets and all that?‬ ‪Tell her to have it ready‬ ‪as I can't stay long.‬ ‪I got held up but I'm on my way now.‬ ‪Thank you.‬ ‪Well?‬ ‪He says he's hardly drunk a thing...‬ ‪And he has an appointment down south‬ ‪and you're taking him?‬ ‪What? Can't you see‬ ‪this guy's losing his marbles?‬ ‪Look, I'm fine, I can assure you!‬ ‪It's disinfectant, that's all.‬ ‪I've hardly drunk any.‬ ‪I worked with solvents all my life,‬ ‪I know it takes more‬ ‪than just a drop...‬ ‪I need to go down south!‬ ‪It's important! Do you understand?‬ ‪Lucas, tell them! Tell your daddy:‬ ‪Pierre needs to go down south!‬ ‪Tell him it's important!‬ ‪Lucas, tell them!‬ ‪OK, so can I go now?‬ ‪Usually, in these cases,‬ ‪I have to inform the police.‬ ‪But with Christmas,‬ ‪I don't have time.‬ ‪-Well that's great, me neither.‬ ‪-Wait!‬ ‪Is the kid yours?‬ ‪What do you think?‬ ‪Right, Lucas, let's go!‬ ‪Lucas? Come on!‬ ‪What the...?‬ ‪You've got to be kidding!‬ ‪Damn it!‬ ‪Excuse me,‬ ‪My car's been vandalised.‬ ‪Did you see who did it?‬ ‪I was busy upstairs...‬ ‪You must do something about it!‬ ‪Sorry, Sir,‬ ‪but I'm a paramedic, not a cop.‬ ‪Right, now where is he?‬ ‪Your son?‬ ‪In the ambulance with his grandpa.‬ ‪He insisted, we were in a rush.‬ ‪His grandpa?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪His grandpa...‬ ‪He's at the hospital‬ ‪on rue du Faubourg Reine.‬ ‪Do you know it?‬ ‪We can show you the way.‬ ‪You've no booster seat?‬ ‪Are you a cop now?‬ ‪You'll follow me?‬ ‪As I told your colleague,‬ ‪I'm covering Gauthier's region.‬ ‪I was going to come this afternoon but‬ ‪something came up and I've no time...‬ ‪Of course it's not an excuse‬ ‪to avoid you, Isabelle.‬ ‪It's just that my car broke down.‬ ‪Could you email your figures to me,‬ ‪please?‬ ‪And I'm counting on you‬ ‪for the promo.‬ ‪And don't tell Pérez!‬ ‪He's on my case.‬ ‪Bye. I owe you one.‬ ‪And lots of love, of course.‬ ‪You can't just run off like that!‬ ‪I told you to stay put!‬ ‪Don't you get it? Goodness me!‬ ‪And what on earth is that?‬ ‪Felt tip all over your new shirt?‬ ‪I can't keep chasing around‬ ‪after you!‬ ‪My life's been a series of disasters‬ ‪since you came along!‬ ‪So I'm going to take you‬ ‪to the police and we're done. OK?‬ ‪What's going on here?‬ ‪You're in a hospital, Sir.‬ ‪Please keep your voice down.‬ ‪Listen Lucas, we need to go now, OK?‬ ‪Why don't you like me?‬ ‪What are you talking about?‬ ‪You said I was a disaster.‬ ‪You don't get it.‬ ‪I do get it. Just go, then.‬ ‪I'll stay with Pierre‬ ‪and he'll take me to Daddy Clément.‬ ‪Is it my fault Pierre is poorly?‬ ‪Of course it's not your fault.‬ ‪It's just bad luck, that's all.‬ ‪Don't worry, he'll be fine.‬ ‪Are you sad, sometimes?‬ ‪No, I don't have the time.‬ ‪Everything'll be OK.‬ ‪I'm sure Pierre will be OK.‬ ‪Shall we wait for him?‬ ‪Do you want to play schools?‬ ‪Go on, I'll be right here.‬ ‪Hey Lucas,‬ ‪stand up for yourself, OK?‬ ‪Is it good?‬ ‪I'm Guillaume Delmas.‬ ‪I'm looking after your father.‬ ‪He's not my father.‬ ‪Is Pierre better now?‬ ‪It's the same every year,‬ ‪they do it so they don't have‬ ‪to spend Christmas alone.‬ ‪One even swallowed staples, once.‬ ‪But in your case, he'd hardly drunk‬ ‪anything, he'll be fine.‬ ‪It was nice of you to stay‬ ‪because...‬ ‪sometimes even families aren't...‬ ‪He wanted to.‬ ‪Oh, that's nice.‬ ‪You must be proud of your son.‬ ‪He's not my son.‬ ‪Be quick.‬ ‪He can't be far.‬ ‪We told the police,‬ ‪the social worker's calling his wife.‬ ‪He says she lives in Peru.‬ ‪We'll let you know...?‬ ‪That won't be necessary.‬ ‪We're not staying in the area,‬ ‪we're in a hurry. Thanks.‬ ‪Right, Lucas, we're going now.‬ ‪Lucas, we're going now!‬ ‪Where's Pierre?‬ ‪He's gone away on a trip.‬ ‪-Why?‬ ‪-He must have felt better‬ ‪and got fed up so he left.‬ ‪You're talking rubbish.‬ ‪Why are you talking rubbish?‬ ‪No!‬ ‪Right, that's it, I give up.‬ ‪Let go now, little man. Let's go!‬ ‪Here.‬ ‪Blow.‬ ‪No, keep it.‬ ‪Crying one minute,‬ ‪laughing the next...‬ &lrm;Enter your destination. ‪Where are we going?‬ ‪Lyon.‬ ‪Where's that?‬ ‪On the way to Iceland.‬ ‪It isn't really.‬ ‪It's in the middle of France.‬ ‪In the Rhone Valley.‬ ‪Do you know the Rhone?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪Name a town on the Rhone.‬ ‪Normandy.‬ ‪Clear off!‬ ‪I'm not getting in with beaknits!‬ ‪You mean beatniks.‬ ‪Did you follow me?‬ ‪Sadly, not.‬ ‪But nothing happens by chance,‬ ‪it's all for a reason.‬ ‪Is this clown car yours?‬ ‪Do you want a ride?‬ ‪Why? Are you going to Toulon?‬ ‪Almost.‬ ‪As long as you don't try to...‬ ‪You get me?‬ ‪Oh, shit.‬ ‪Get in!‬ ‪Is he your son?‬ ‪Half mine.‬ ‪I don't doubt that.‬ ‪You didn't tell me you had a kid.‬ ‪What's your name?‬ ‪Lucas. He's shy.‬ ‪I'm not shy!‬ ‪Hi, Lucas.‬ ‪I'm Julie.‬ ‪He's really sweet.‬ ‪Mixed race, really cute.‬ ‪Where's his mother from?‬ ‪Guadeloupe, Mali, Madagascar?‬ ‪She's gone away.‬ ‪Are you going to Toulon then?‬ ‪You said...‬ ‪I put that on the sign,‬ ‪otherwise nobody will stop.‬ ‪Hey, there's a guy behind‬ ‪waving at you.‬ ‪Pierre!‬ ‪It's Pierre!‬ ‪Do you know him?‬ ‪Lucas!‬ ‪Wait for me! Wait!‬ ‪Lucas, get back in the car!‬ ‪Take me with you, please!‬ ‪Are you mad?‬ ‪I can't! I've a job, work to do!‬ ‪Appointments to keep!‬ ‪What about her, then?‬ ‪I've got an appointment too,‬ ‪one I can't miss.‬ ‪I didn't think I'd make it‬ ‪and now our paths have crossed.‬ ‪So obviously,‬ ‪I thought it's now or never!‬ ‪Enough now! Lucas!‬ ‪Come on, Lucas!‬ ‪What on earth's going on?‬ ‪Mr Pérez...‬ ‪Is there a problem?‬ ‪Everything's fine.‬ ‪I beg you,‬ ‪don't leave me here on my own!‬ ‪Doesn't look fine. Are you OK?‬ ‪Never you mind! Clear off!‬ ‪Time of the month, is it?‬ ‪What's with Mr Bean?‬ ‪Nothing! Come on, get in!‬ ‪You too! Lucas, come on!‬ ‪Hurry up before I change my mind.‬ ‪Thank you. Have a nice day.‬ ‪Yeah, whatever. Arsehole!‬ ‪Why am I doing this? Why?‬ ‪What?‬ ‪Nothing!‬ ‪What was all that with that guy?‬ ‪Couldn't help it.‬ ‪I can't stand‬ ‪these part-time do-gooders,‬ ‪all side partings and coughlinks.‬ ‪Cufflinks.‬ ‪What?‬ ‪OPERATION GO-SLOW‬ ‪ROAD BLOCKED IN FIVE KM‬ ‪That's all we need.‬ ‪Shit.‬ &lrm;Enter your destination. ‪What's wrong with the main road?‬ ‪Everyone else'll be‬ ‪on the main road.‬ ‪Leave it to me.‬ &lrm;In four hundred metres, turn right. ‪You drive fast!‬ ‪You wanted a lift, didn't you?‬ ‪What?‬ &lrm;Turn right. ‪What are you doing?‬ &lrm;Turn left. &lrm;You have arrived. ‪Shit!‬ ‪I wasn't even scared.‬ ‪It's all my fault.‬ ‪Who are you, anyway?‬ ‪He drank some Duck,‬ ‪but now he's better.‬ ‪I can't get a signal.‬ ‪Can you get one on yours?‬ ‪I haven't got one.‬ ‪I can't stand people calling me‬ ‪for the slightest thing.‬ ‪"Where are you? What are you doing?"‬ ‪Aren't I allowed?‬ ‪There's lots you can't stand.‬ ‪You're helping me.‬ ‪It's definitely stuck.‬ ‪We're in big trouble now!‬ ‪Will you help me pick up‬ ‪the leaflets?‬ ‪What have I got myself into?‬ ‪Pierre filled me in.‬ ‪It's not the end of the world.‬ ‪If he wants to do a runner‬ ‪from hospital for an appointment,‬ ‪what's it to you?‬ ‪Of course.‬ ‪What?‬ ‪-What did you say?‬ ‪-You wouldn't understand.‬ ‪What does that mean?‬ ‪You really are talking crap!‬ ‪I have to be in Lyon‬ ‪tomorrow morning‬ ‪or I might well lose my job.‬ ‪The only job I can do,‬ ‪the only job I've ever done.‬ ‪Happy now? Do you get it?‬ ‪Yeah, I guess.‬ ‪I always got on with my life in peace‬ ‪without any hassle. But now,‬ ‪what went wrong?‬ ‪And the kid?‬ ‪Whose is he?‬ ‪I'm not stupid.‬ ‪You're a playboy‬ ‪with no wedding ring,‬ ‪and the kid's dressed like a clown.‬ ‪And you've no booster seat.‬ ‪Damn the bloody booster seat!‬ ‪His mum's got a few problems.‬ ‪I'm taking him to his dad's.‬ ‪Satisfied?‬ ‪What sort of problems?‬ ‪Like we all have.‬ ‪Maybe not you,‬ ‪but I've got plenty right now.‬ ‪I'd have had a look at the engine,‬ ‪but I don't know how to open it.‬ ‪But if I can help...?‬ ‪You've done enough.‬ ‪We'll walk to a town.‬ ‪I was wondering‬ ‪if you do your flyers on a computer?‬ ‪The visuals, I mean.‬ ‪It's what I used to do.‬ ‪Before computers came along.‬ ‪I used to design labels,‬ ‪for tins of food, actually.‬ ‪Right. Where's Lucas?‬ ‪Lucas!‬ ‪Lucas, he's... He was just here.‬ ‪He was helping me.‬ ‪Can't he stay put for two seconds,‬ ‪this kid?‬ ‪I don't believe it.‬ ‪Oh my God! My God!‬ ‪What's wrong?‬ ‪The little boy fell in the water,‬ ‪picking up the flyers.‬ ‪-It's all my fault.‬ ‪-No...‬ ‪Yes, it's his fault!‬ ‪You can't leave a kid alone‬ ‪out here!‬ ‪Kids need caring for!‬ ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪I'll dive in to look.‬ ‪That's enough! You're crazy!‬ ‪Are you there?‬ ‪I found this in the woods!‬ ‪Are you sure about this village?‬ ‪What?‬ ‪Isn't that what they say,‬ ‪all roads lead to Rome?‬ ‪You wanted to go to Italy‬ ‪so you're on your way.‬ ‪Where's Rome? Is it far?‬ ‪Here, you can keep it.‬ ‪I've stopped crying now.‬ ‪Are you tired?‬ ‪Climb on.‬ ‪Hold on tight.‬ ‪What?‬ ‪Let's get a move on.‬ ‪Did you think‬ ‪I'd fallen in the water?‬ ‪Hold on tight, I said.‬ ‪We're going to freeze to death‬ ‪thanks to you.‬ ‪Fantastic.‬ ‪If only my wife could see me now!‬ ‪She wouldn't believe it.‬ ‪She was like you.‬ ‪Always wanting to travel,‬ ‪up hill and down dale.‬ ‪-Did you ever go too?‬ ‪-Yes.‬ ‪Once I forced myself to go,‬ ‪but I didn't like it.‬ ‪In fact,‬ ‪I've never really enjoyed anything.‬ ‪After that,‬ ‪I just let her go on her own.‬ ‪Then one day,‬ ‪she went to Peru,‬ ‪I'm not sure where,‬ ‪it was thirty years ago.‬ ‪She met a guy who also loved‬ ‪travelling and all that.‬ ‪So, as you can imagine,‬ ‪she never came back.‬ ‪She settled over there, with him.‬ ‪And that was that.‬ ‪That stinks.‬ ‪What stinks?‬ ‪Nothing. Nothing stinks.‬ ‪I've always kept in touch with her,‬ ‪with her partner, too.‬ ‪He's a nice guy. He's called Pablo.‬ ‪They're a nice couple.‬ ‪Sometimes, loving someone‬ ‪means accepting being apart.‬ ‪I'm hungry.‬ ‪Wait...‬ ‪Can you hear that?‬ ‪What is it?‬ ‪I don't want any more.‬ ‪It's too cold tonight.‬ ‪I'll look at your car with my son‬ ‪in the morning.‬ ‪He's good at mechanics.‬ ‪And not just bikes!‬ ‪I'll find you a perch.‬ ‪It's OK, it's a big house.‬ ‪How far away from Lyon are we?‬ ‪I have to be there in the morning.‬ ‪It's do-able.‬ ‪Unless your steering's knackered.‬ ‪Pierre!‬ ‪I'm coming.‬ ‪That's odd.‬ ‪Why is everything dark?‬ ‪Happy birthday!‬ ‪Thank you.‬ ‪TEN GOLDEN DAYS‬ &lrm;This number is unavailable. ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪Calling his dad.‬ ‪Now's not the time, supper's ready.‬ ‪And he needs his bed.‬ ‪I don't know what time's bedtime‬ ‪but I think he's tired.‬ ‪There...‬ ‪Will you tell me a story?‬ ‪I'm not very good at stories.‬ ‪Aren't you tired?‬ ‪Please?‬ ‪Well just one, OK?‬ ‪It's the story of a frog‬ ‪who wanted to be as big as a bull.‬ ‪Why?‬ ‪Because it was jealous, that's why.‬ ‪The little frog wanted to be‬ ‪as big as a big bull.‬ ‪What's a bull?‬ ‪A bull is like a cow.‬ ‪You know how you have‬ ‪men and women?‬ ‪Well, you also have bulls and cows.‬ ‪You see?‬ ‪Right,‬ ‪so the frog ate everything‬ ‪it could find, to get bigger.‬ ‪It ate carrots,‬ ‪courgettes, melons, strawberries.‬ ‪Carrots?‬ ‪If you want to get bigger,‬ ‪you eat everything!‬ ‪Why not sweets?‬ ‪Sweets too, it ate sweets.‬ ‪Kilos of sweets, OK?‬ ‪Was it rich, the frog?‬ ‪What?‬ ‪Mummy said rich people‬ ‪eat more than us.‬ ‪Yes, I suppose so.‬ ‪It was rich.‬ ‪Well anyway, it ate and ate,‬ ‪and it got bigger.‬ ‪Bigger and bigger and bigger.‬ ‪And then, all of a sudden,‬ ‪it exploded! BOOM!‬ ‪BANG!‬ ‪Why did it explode?‬ ‪Because it ate too much.‬ ‪If I eat too much, will I explode?‬ ‪No. You're not a frog, are you?‬ ‪Of course not.‬ ‪Off to sleep now, OK?‬ ‪Are we nearly at Daddy Clément's?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪Shall I leave the light on?‬ ‪Where are you going?‬ ‪I'll be right next door, OK?‬ ‪Shall I leave the door open?‬ ‪OK?‬ ‪Hey, Marc?‬ ‪Now what?‬ ‪You're good at telling stories.‬ ‪The story of a frog who wanted to be‬ ‪as big as a cow's husband.‬ ‪It ate kilos of sweets.‬ ‪And all of a sudden,‬ ‪it went BANG and exploded.‬ ‪And it was so rich‬ ‪that it ate even more sweets,‬ ‪ice cream, chocolate and bread‬ ‪and more sweets‬ ‪and ice cream,‬ ‪and then it exploded! BANG!‬ ‪Sorry...‬ ‪The boy's tucked up in bed?‬ ‪I was just saying,‬ ‪you've been lucky.‬ ‪With the strike‬ ‪and the traffic jams,‬ ‪many folk'll kip in their cars‬ ‪tonight.‬ ‪At least you avoided that.‬ ‪It's kind of you‬ ‪to take us in like this.‬ ‪Along with your wife,‬ ‪your son and your mum.‬ ‪It's great to be part‬ ‪of a family like this.‬ ‪Cheers!‬ ‪Cheers!‬ ‪It's mine, too, today.‬ ‪My birthday...‬ ‪You should have said!‬ ‪I didn't think. I haven't‬ ‪celebrated it for years, so...‬ ‪Well, happy birthday!‬ ‪Happy birthday!‬ ‪Happy birthday!‬ ‪They thought we were a couple!‬ ‪Anyone can see‬ ‪you're a lot older than me!‬ ‪Such a charmer!‬ ‪Why are you smiling? What is it?‬ ‪I'm not smiling.‬ ‪Yes, you are, I saw you.‬ ‪Don't think I want to sleep‬ ‪on a sofa-bed with you!‬ ‪And keep your trousers on!‬ ‪I'd planned to do just that.‬ ‪What's the matter? What is it now?‬ ‪You've only got a small rucksack,‬ ‪a thin coat, canvas trainers...‬ ‪You're no backpacker.‬ ‪Travelling's not your thing.‬ ‪You look at your stomach,‬ ‪you're giving up smoking,‬ ‪you don't drink‬ ‪and I saw you at the hospital.‬ ‪What about the father?‬ ‪Does he know?‬ ‪I met mine at my mum's funeral.‬ ‪Saw him for less than an hour.‬ ‪We'd nothing to say to each other.‬ ‪After, I said "Goodbye, Sir."‬ ‪I don't have his name,‬ ‪my mum said he was dead.‬ ‪But it wasn't true.‬ ‪-Let me tell you...‬ ‪-You're wrong.‬ ‪I'm not up the duff.‬ ‪I'm not up the duff.‬ ‪I worked in a travel agency‬ ‪for seven months.‬ ‪Before that, I'd done loads‬ ‪of crappy little jobs.‬ ‪It was really cool there,‬ ‪something I'd always dreamt of.‬ ‪So I behaved, I was careful‬ ‪how I spoke and all that.‬ ‪Then one evening, my boss grabs my‬ ‪arse, so I turn round and slap him.‬ ‪And the pervert sacks me.‬ ‪Of course.‬ ‪The thing was‬ ‪that I couldn't bring myself‬ ‪to tell my friends and my parents.‬ ‪They'd have said I was too mouthy,‬ ‪I couldn't hold down a job.‬ ‪So I just took off. That's it.‬ ‪I might lose my job, too.‬ ‪And the only people I can talk to‬ ‪are a half-dyslexic,‬ ‪unemployed fake backpacker,‬ ‪a six-year-old and an old man‬ ‪who drinks Toilet Duck.‬ ‪Well...‬ ‪What are you doing?‬ ‪I move a lot in my sleep.‬ ‪I don't want a slap.‬ ‪You're such an idiot!‬ ‪Actually,‬ ‪it's not my birthday.‬ ‪I just wanted it to be.‬ ‪Goodnight, Marc.‬ ‪Goodnight, Julie.‬ &lrm;And this morning, police stopped &lrm;a cargo ship in Calais &lrm;carrying ten illegal immigrants &lrm;heading for the United Kingdom. &lrm;An African woman in her 30s &lrm;jumped overboard &lrm;when the police arrived. &lrm;Her body was recovered &lrm;and an inquest is underway. ‪Enough reading, we have to go now.‬ ‪Won't you help me?‬ ‪Not bothered, right?‬ ‪Are these boots too small?‬ ‪That's it.‬ ‪Right, where are your gloves?‬ ‪In my boots.‬ ‪Yes, Mr Pérez.‬ &lrm;Bajau, at last! &lrm;What's going on? &lrm;Where have you been? ‪I was just going to call you.‬ ‪I couldn't get a signal‬ ‪on the B roads.‬ ‪I can't hear you very well...‬ &lrm;What's all this about you &lrm;crashing your car? ‪What crash?‬ ‪Isabelle from the Dijon store‬ ‪told me everything. Well?‬ &lrm;Well? ‪Everything's sorted now. It's fine.‬ ‪-Isabelle's mailing me...‬ ‪-Forget it, Bajau!‬ ‪Pardon?‬ &lrm;Forget your grand tour. It's over. ‪Be in Zurich first thing tomorrow.‬ ‪Zurich? But I thought...‬ &lrm;Tomorrow, 9am. ‪Sylvie will send you‬ ‪the list of places to visit.‬ ‪Make sure you're contactable!‬ ‪There you go!‬ ‪Now we've got someone‬ ‪for Switzerland.‬ ‪Is there a problem?‬ ‪No.‬ ‪Being on my own all night,‬ ‪I had plenty of time to think.‬ ‪Italy's for another day.‬ ‪The farmer's son's taking me‬ ‪to the station.‬ ‪Are you going away?‬ ‪Where to?‬ ‪Back to my family.‬ ‪I've got some things to tell them.‬ ‪If I ever have a little boy,‬ ‪I'd like him to be as sweet as you!‬ ‪Thanks.‬ ‪You'll call me?‬ ‪But you haven't got a phone.‬ ‪Is Julie your girlfriend?‬ ‪What are you talking about?‬ ‪It'll do for now‬ ‪but get it checked by a garage.‬ ‪Oh yes, I forgot to warn you.‬ ‪Who did that?‬ ‪I did!‬ ‪It was partly my fault,‬ ‪so I thought I'd sort it out.‬ ‪My colours were limited, but...‬ ‪Do you like it?‬ ‪You like it?‬ ‪They're daisies!‬ ‪Daisies are so pretty.‬ ‪Are you sure? You'll be OK?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪Where are you going?‬ ‪I've got an appointment‬ ‪with my wife.‬ ‪Why didn't you say? If you'd said...‬ ‪You didn't say you were taking Lucas‬ ‪to his father either.‬ ‪You know, my job...‬ ‪it was all that mattered.‬ ‪I had little secrets.‬ ‪I wanted to pass them onto my son.‬ ‪My son.‬ ‪But I never had one.‬ ‪I can't have children.‬ ‪But that's how it is,‬ ‪you can't always get what you want.‬ ‪After that, I couldn't be bothered.‬ ‪So my wife left me,‬ ‪went off on her own. As for me,‬ ‪I haven't been anywhere for years.‬ ‪Then I saw the little boy‬ ‪at the shopping centre,‬ ‪and that was that.‬ ‪Here, I'll lend him to you,‬ ‪then you won't be lonely.‬ ‪Two days ago, I couldn't be bothered‬ ‪with anything.‬ ‪Thank you, Marc, thank you.‬ ‪Thank you, thank you.‬ ‪Right, little man,‬ ‪I'll drop you off.‬ ‪I'm looking for Clément Rozière.‬ ‪Does he live here?‬ ‪Yes.‬ ‪Is that lady trying to be‬ ‪like the frog?‬ ‪It's for you.‬ ‪You are...?‬ ‪Father Clément.‬ ‪Clément Rozière.‬ ‪And you? Are you Lucas?‬ ‪Wow, you've really grown!‬ ‪Aren't you going to say hello?‬ ‪You don't remember me.‬ ‪He's really grown.‬ ‪He looks really healthy now.‬ ‪He was in such a bad way‬ ‪when they arrived.‬ ‪How do we know it's her?‬ ‪She's not the only immigrant‬ ‪heading for Britain.‬ ‪She sent me this for Lucas.‬ ‪She wrote that a man she trusted‬ ‪would bring him here.‬ ‪She hoped she hadn't made a mistake.‬ ‪Of all the women I've taken in here,‬ ‪she was the biggest fighter.‬ ‪She wanted him to have a better life‬ ‪than she. Did all she could.‬ ‪Even leaving him,‬ ‪so he'd have a better life.‬ ‪Listen...‬ ‪I'm sorry, I would love to help‬ ‪but I can't, I have commitments.‬ ‪You see...‬ ‪I absolutely have to be‬ ‪in Zurich tomorrow.‬ ‪That's how it is.‬ ‪I've got to go.‬ ‪Aren't you going to say goodbye?‬ ‪What do you think it is?‬ ‪You're rubbish, it's a frog.‬ ‪Listen, Lucas, it's complicated.‬ ‪I need to tell you something.‬ ‪You know your mummy, she's...‬ ‪... she's gone away on a trip.‬ ‪Yes. But a very long trip.‬ ‪Very far away.‬ ‪So far, she won't be coming back,‬ ‪Lucas.‬ ‪Do you understand?‬ ‪I have to go now. Because of work.‬ ‪I brought you here, but now...‬ ‪I've got to go.‬ ‪I'm really pleased to have met you.‬ ‪-Where are we going?‬ ‪-To buy a booster seat.‬ ‪TEN GOLDEN DAYS‬ ‪Subtitle translation by Gail Bond‬
