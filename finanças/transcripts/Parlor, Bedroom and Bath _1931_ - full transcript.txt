Say, Ginny. What do you say we married right away? Oh, Jeff, don't start that again. I told you a thousand times I'll never marry until Angie marries. See, Angie better get on with herself. She's not getting any younger. - That's just it. She's four years older than I am. If I get married first people are gonna call her an old maid. And nobody will marry her. Yes. And in the meantime we have to wait and... Hey. Watch her with Bertie. I'm sorry Bertie, but I've decided that I can't marry you. Oh, but why? Why the sudden change? I mean, just say it, dash it! You don't come up with specifications. Specifications? What am I, a horse or a silly ass? Well I wouldn't say that you were silly. But my dear, you know you... you can't judge a husband in a bathing suit. No, but you can get a rough idea. Oh. Looks like another flop. Oh, let her alone, dear. She'll find the right man someday. Yeah, we won't live that long. Why did she turn down Jack Peters? Oh, she said he had no romance. No excitement. She wants a man that you'll never be sure of. Is that so? Well, What about...what about George Waters? He looked like he'd never been kissed. Oh, rot. I'll tell you one thing. I'm not going to let your sister interfere with our happiness. Oh, Jeff... - I mean it! You're going to marry me next week, nothing is going to stop me. - But how can I... And you know what I'll do I'll marry Angie myself. What? - Yes, and I'll poison her and marry you. Where are you going? Where am I going? To get the poison. Well, I must leave and take that train to town, honey. Oh, Fred. You think of nothing but business. I wish I could have a husband at least one night a week. Hey you cut that off, that's my wife. Sorry, thought it was mine. Can you beat that? Honey, when I'm away at night, I hope you won't... You hope I never look at another man. Will you just better not leave me alone so much. Take a little wify's tip. Nita, why do you always start pulling at stuff? You know how I hate it. Oh, you two love birds, at it again. Well Angie, how would you like your husband leaving you every night for business? Are you sure it's business? -No, I'm not. Then I love it. Oh, if I only had a husband that could make me jealous. Why, I'd send him out at night just to get a thrill when he came home. Angie, you talk like a fool. How would Fred like it if I started going out at night? Oh, you wouldn't mind Fred, would you not? Not if the man was good-looking Oh no, I wouldn't mind because I'd have the extreme pleasure of twisting his neck! Bye, honey. Goodbye, Fred. Bye. Oh, Nita, the more I see of men the more I love my dog. Don't wait for me, you go off and have your lunches. Alright. -See you there. Bye. Look out there! Say, are you hurt? Say, answer me! Are you hurt? Speak! Oh... Help! Help, somebody get a doctor! Help there! Help! Get a doctor! Get a doctor! I think he's dead! Such a poor dear! He has such a soulful sad face. How could you be so careless? Suppose he dies! That's right, that's right. Be as cheerful as possible. Hello! What's this? Carpet tacks! Let's see if there's any more. Ah! Ah! Easy, easy, easy... Well, It's a pretty bad scalp wound but no patterned fracture. Probably some brain concussion. He must get perfect rest and quiet. I advise he have a nurse. Oh, would I do, doctor? I'd give him the best possible care. The poor thing. Well, alright miss Embrey if you want to. I'll go down and write up some instructions for you. I wonder who he is. He looks like one who has loved and suffered. Oh! Oh, oh, he's coming to...! Oh, there was an accident, my poor man and you're in my home. Don't worry. Everything will be alright. I'm going to take care of you. I won't be gone long, I'm just going down to see what the doctor tells me to do for you. C'mon Ginny I may need you. Oh, Jeff dear, now that you're here, you stay here and take care of him, won't you? You watch over him carefully. C'mon Ginny we'll see what the doctor has to say. Hurry up. I'm awfully sorry, old man. I'm the fellow who hit you. But you weren't looking where you were going. Oh, I was looking at her. Huh, I... I don't blame you. And, uh... What do you think of her now that you've met her? Oh, she's beautiful. Say, what's your name? Reginald Irving. What business are you in? I'm a sign tacker. A what? Sign tacker. I get out putting signs on telegraph posts and fences and things. Oh, I see... In the advertising business, huh? Yeah. Are you... married? Oh, no, no. Have you ever had anything to do with women? Oh, I used to sell vacuum cleaners. Oh, no, no, I mean Have you ever had a love affair with a woman? Oh, gosh no. Well, you're going to have. Oh, I can't. I don't get paid until Saturday. That's why this one costs you anything. You like Miss Embrey, don't you? Is that the... uh, lady that was just here? Mm hmm. Oh, she's marvelous. How would you like to know her real well? I might fix it, so that she could be the mother of your children. Continuously (inaudible) I think the scalp wound will cure up very well indeed. - Thank you, doctor. - Goodbye, ladies. -I'll take good care of things. - Goodbye, Doctor. Goodbye. Well, I found out who our patient is. -Really? -Mm hmm, ha ha. You'll never guess! Oh, darling, don't be so mysterious. Reggie Irving. Reggie Irving? Aha, THE Reggie Irving. I don't know him. What? You don't know Reggie Irving, the great outdoors man? Does he run with our set? Oh, no, no, hardly. No. He's well-known in London and Paris. I'm surprised you've never heard of the name. I've never heard of him either. Listen. He's figured in so many divorce cases that all the lawyers in France wept when he left. Not really? Surely. -Not... - Mm hmm. Reggie Irving. The little devil. And he has such a soulful innocent look in his eyes. Innocent? Oh, that's just the way he works. Well, the very clothes he had on today were a disguise. He's probably on his way to a rendezvous with a home of one of your neighbors. - I wonder who it can be. - Yes. Oh, I hear he's the worst bourgeois snake in captivity. Now pardon me. What are you going to do? What am I gonna do? Calling for an ambulance. Not on your life. The doctor said he mustn't be moved. But he can't stay here, what will people say? Oh, don't be absurd. I can manage him perfectly. But how about Ginny? She'll probably fall for him too, and I couldn't stand that. I'll take care of Ginny. Alright, have it your own way but remember I warned you. Warned me? You've intrigued me. Come in. A lady is to see Mr. Irving. Tell her that he can't see anyone. Oh, I am sure he will see me. Reggie! My poor darling! Reggie! To think of you, lying here, like this. Heaven! What's this? Porridge! Here. Take this away. He detests porridge. - Really, I must... - Don't you suppose I know what he likes for breakfast? Reggie. Reggie! Don't you know me? It's your little Gwenie. Your little Gwenie. And it's true, what they told me downstairs. He's lost his memory. Oh, Reggie! Reggie! - My poor... - Really, I must ask you to leave. You're disturbing him. Alright, nurse. When you'll get on your feet again, sweetheart... Remember. My arms will be waiting. Two ladies to see Mr. Irving. - Reggie, Reggie, darling. - Oh, Reggie, my darling. Take your hands off of him. Will you please take your hands off of him? Reggie, darling, I didn't know that you were sick and I didn't know you had such a bad wound. Will you please take your hands off of him? Look at me, Reggie, darling. Did you put it over? Norma Shearer couldn't have done any better. Ha, ha, good girl. Here's fifty extra. Mm hmm. I can't have this a minute longer. As long as Mr. Irving is in my house, in my charge, I can't have his temperature going up like this. You'll have to go. And as far as you're concerned I'm gonna sue you for breach of promise and have you thrown in jail! Stop him! Fifty dollars to the man who stops him! Stop him! Stop him! Good boy, I've got him! You, here! That's it. Hey, nevermind that. Quit! Phil, I wanna him alive. Come along, give him to me. Give him to me. I think he's alright. Alright, I'll pick up with you later. Well, I see you later. He must have absolute rest and quiet, Marie. No one must enter or disturb him in any way. Yes, ma'am. I would suggest-(mixed voices) Hello sweetie! How are you? Hello, darling. Say darling, I've got some news for you. - Really? - Yes, I think Angie's just mad about that little shrimp upstairs. Is that so? Well you know... She wouldn't let anybody here come near the room. No, I don't think she would. Oh, she's going to have a... devil of a time with that little brute. What's the matter, darling? Is someone... Oh, I'm just fixing the curtains, sweetheart. -Oh, I see. - Yes, they're badly hung. - I'm going upstairs, darling. - Yes, darling. - I'll have the curtains fixed. - Alright sweetie. When the wind blows they... have no resistance. Alright darling, you go up change and I'll fix the curtains. Hey, hey! What did I tell you? Don't do that, I wan't him alive! Just give him to me. Well. C'mon, put him over here. So long, boys. Don't forget to put those glasses away, Bridget. And be very careful of them. Hello, Horace. How are you? Quite nicely. Thank you, sir. I'm glad to see you. Can I do anything for you, sir? No, nothing. Thank you. Nice pants that you have, Horace. Thank you, sir. I'm glad you like it. Thank you, sir. Hello Horace! Glad to see you. Very glad to see you. Glad that you're with us. Goodbye, Horace! What on earth is the matter? "Gardenia sat on the terrace of the Hotel du Paris. Dishing out..." I was afraid those screams might've wakened him. No, he's quite alright. I'm just reading him to sleep. "An attentive waiter saw her, went to her, and hovered over her. Is there anything the madame desires? Yes..." - Oh, he's perspiring dreadfully. Is he? Oh, that's splendid, yes. The fever has probably broken up. "Being a waiter, he waited. But, being... Being an intelligent waiter, he..." Just a little, uh... irriation somewhere. "Being an intelligent waiter, he didn't wait very long. And also being..." No, he didn't do it, did he. "So, she sat off the terrace..." Lovely gown, neighbor. Angie will be down soon. Yes, I wanna see Angie. Have you seen this issue of the Social Gossip? No! Don't tell me there's more about her and Reggie Irving. "Of course we knew there'd be lots of broken hearts when Reggie Irving's engagement to Angelica Embrey was announced. But we hardly expected from the prospective bridegrooms various explanations were necessitated midnight supper last Monday in a private room at the Seaside Hotel with a certain lovely blonde divorcee of Long Island." Oh, Leila, that's awful! And a week before the wedding... Angie already thinks that I've been making... eyes and side glances at that impossible shrimp of hers. And this atrocious paper accuses me of being his companion. And you weren't there at all, were you darling? Thank goodness I have a perfect alibi. - Oh, Jeff. - Oh , that's alright darling. I'll go and see Reggie and demand an explanation. You do that, dear. Maybe it isn't true. I hope so for Angie's sake. Excuse me. Well, and how's everything? Oh, it's terrible. Terrible? What happened? She's worth eight million dollars! And what's so terrible about that? Oh, I would never marry a woman for her money. Say, what's the matter with you? You're managing her estate and in another week she'll be your wife. And I oughta tell her that I am not the kind of man she thinks I am. Sit down. You do that, and I'll... Oh, there you are darling. Really, darling. You mustn't work so hard. We're having tea on the terrace. You must come out. Wait a minute, Angelica. I wanna talk to you. Well of course dear, what is it? I've got something I want to say to you. Alone. I know what it is, dear. You want to tell me how much you love me and how happy you are. But suppose I told you that I'm not the man you think I am, and... And, uh... that I don't know these other women. I've never been out with them at all. You naughty, naughty boy. As if I believe it. No, darling. It's not your past I'm worried about. It's your future and your present. Bye bye, dear. It's no use. She won't believe me. - I... - Sit. Sit. Do you want to spoil everything? Think of all I've done for you. Think of all this means to me. You're not going to weaken until Ginny and I are married. Then, if you're determined to go ahead and wreck two lives one of them human, go as far as you like. But until then you'll stick. You'll stick. And as for that insignificant little nincompoop that you're crazy about I wouldn't give him a thought. Indeed. Well, many very attractive women have, my dear. And besides, he is not a nincompoop. Oh, Angie my dear. If he were ever left alone in a dark room with a beautiful woman he'd drop dead. Here's Freddy! Hello, Fred. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. How did you know I was here? - I telephoned over. How are you, Angie? How are you, Ginny? - Hello, Fred. - You're going to stay to tea of course Fred? No thanks, I can't stop. Oh, Fred. I'm sorry Nita. I've got to go out of town at once. I really dropped in to say goodbye. Oh, Fred, take me with you. I can't dear, this is... This is business. Business again. Oh, perhaps you two would like to say your tender goodbyes in private. C'mon, Ginny. I told you it's business, dear. Business. Mr. Irving. Did you have this scandalous article put in here? Oh, no... Did you explain Angie the story isn't true? There's no use explaining. She insists on believing that I'm bad. And I'm not, honest I'm not. Well, I should think she'll be able to take one look at you and realize that if you were left alone in a room with a woman why... - We'd both be safe. I was in a house one time all alone with the most beautiful French maid. She tried to kiss me. She was baking a pie... And what did you do? I ate the pie. Oh, this is perfectly dreadful. I wonder if everybody thinks I was there, and that you held me in your arms and kissed me. Oh, I wouldn't know how. Why... You'll never get such thoughts, do you? Oh, I get the toughts but I'm scared to carry them out. Oh, Leila. I apologize for even thinking that story was true. Why, you have too much sense to in be seen with this poor little nitwit. Oh, you heard. Yes, and I'm happy I did. Say Angie, what happened? Oh, nothing happened, that just yet. Why nothing ever happened to Reggie. He's not even a man. Oh, I am too! Even professor Einstein couldn't make me believe that. Now see what you've done, you sap! Oh, it's all I can do to keep my hands off you. I didn't know she was listening! Oh, you idiot! You've gummed up the whole works. Now we've got to do something at once, or else it's all off. I wish it was. I'm tired of being a villain. Hey, I got it! I got it! You're going to get caught with the goods. I'm going to be a crook? A crook, no. You're going to have an affair with a woman, tonight. I'm a little nervous. Can't you make it tomorrow night? No, tonight. What woman? Oh, nevermind. Any woman, I'll look into that. Now listen. You will go to the seaside hotel, you may have my room there. You will register as Mr. and Mrs. John Smith and Angelica will catch you. Do you think that'll help me with Angelica? Help you? Why, it'll marry you to her. Supposing Angelica is delayed. She won't be delayed, I'll look into that. Well, what will I do with this woman while I'm waiting? Gee, I'm not much at talking. Now, what I'll tell you... Here, I'll draw a diagram for you. Now come along, write this down. Now, first of all you register as Mr. and Mrs. John Smith. Mr. and Mrs. John Smith. Right. Right. Now, when you first get to your room, order some... champagne and broiled lobster. Champ... Can't you make it beer? Beer certainly not, champagne. C-H-A-M-P-A... Oh, well, make it wine. W-I-N-E. Well, what do I call her? Oh, call her kid, sweetheart, baby. Kid, sweetheart, baby. And then, when you're helping her to take off her... Take off her what? Wrap. R-A-P. No, wrap. W-R-A-P. Wap? Make it coat. K-O-T-E. Then, slip your arms around her, give her a little kiss. Kiss. Then pull her down onto your knee Must I do that? Of course you must. Well, I'll put her down. And after the knee, what happens? Haven't you any imagination? Yeah but I'm afraid to depend on it. Oh, well, you got enough there anyhow. Now come along. Run off to your room and pack your bags. I'll attend with everything else. Go ahead, have a good time! I'll have a good time if it kills me. And listen, whatever you do, don't weaken. Quick as you can, go ahead boy. Hurry up! Is Jefferson Haywood in? I'll see, madam. - Who shall I say is calling? - But I have an appointment. What is the name, please? He expects me! What is the name, please? Say, what if I don't wanna tell you? Well I shall not know who to say is here, madam. Well good, go tell him I'm here. Yes, but... What is it all about? I wasn't going to give my name after the article you made me put in my column. I'm so glad you came. I rushed the moment I got your note. Come along, sit down. Goodness. But what is it? You got me all goosepimples. Polly. You know how anxious I am to get married. Well, not half as anxious as I am and look how calm I act. Yeah, but I want to get married next week and you're the one who's going to do it for me. Do it for you? Great Scott, when a man gets married that's one thing he must do for himself. Oh, don't you understand? Tell me something and I'll understand it. Alright. I want you to meet this Reggie Irving. You mean the man that I've been scandalizing in my column? Mm hmm. I want you to meet him alone. Now, it's alright. It's alright, this is just a trick. Yeah, well you don't want me, you want a magician. Not, but he's quite harmless! Why, if he would find himself in a room alone with a woman he probably fainted. Sometimes they come to life. I'll be seeing you. Sit down! Great Scott, don't scare me! Now, listen. I only want you to have supper with him. Will you? Well, will he give me a good supper? Oh, sure! In my room, which is at Seaside Hotel. And then, Miss Embrey, his fiancée will catch you there. That's all. That's enough. The last time I was caught by a fiancée she had more hair on her hands that I had in my head. I'm not worrying about your hair. Well I am, it's darn hard to match. Now, you... Jeff, you act so, why- why- You ought to see a doctor. Good bye. Now, come here! Listen, Polly. We've always been good friends, haven't we? Yes, but you're scaring the friendship out of me. Come along and let's get organized. I told you over the telephone what a terrible fix I was in, didn't I? Now then, if we can only get Angelica to find her Reggie with another woman... Oh, I see. Looks don't mean anything. Anyone will do. Oh, so you picked me. Thanks. Oh, no, you're such a great scout. Yes, I'm Buffalo Bill. Now listen. You will register as Mr. and Mrs. John Smith. Mr. and Mrs. John Smith? Now I'm Pocahontas! No, that's just to get in! You're suppose to be Reggie's wife, Mrs. John Smith. A pro tem. Oh, I'd love to be a wife pro tem. You can have all the fun and none of the housework. - You better see another architect. - Oh, maybe you're right. I better find someone who can put a little pep into a man. Someone with an iron fist to teach a man how to act with a woman. Oh, yeah? What is the address of the Seaside Hotel? Nita, won't you listen to reason? If you don't take me, you'll be sorry. I told you I can't! Then go. And I don't care if you never come back. Nita, you don't mean that. Yes I do. Every word of it. Leave me alone. Oh, very well. I'll wire you when I arrive. Take my excuses to Miss Embrey. You make them yourself! Bye, dear. Oh, Fred! Yes, you have. Here it is. Now, Seaside Hotel at seven o'clock, coach Reggie and supper. Gee, I love supper. I hope they have meat. So long, Jeff. I'll see you Thursday. - Bye bye, Polly. I know what I'll do. I'll raise the devil. I'm going out with the worst man I know to a terrible place. And I'm gonna let Freddy know about it. Then he'll have to come back. Well, after all dear it's your own affair. But don't do anything foolish. Alimony may be easy money but it don't make up for a lot of lonesome nights. Hurry up! What's the idea of the golf clubs? Oh, I thought maybe if Angelica was late I could practice putting. Go ahead, beat it, beat it. Go by the garden. Go ahead, everything's all set. Reggie! Oh, hello! Why, Reggie, you wicked boy. Where are you going? Oh, no place in particular. Oh, yes you are. You are going to take me to supper to the worst place you know. Huh? Oh, I'm so glad it's you. Why, Reggie! Whoever would've thought you were so wicked. Where should we go? Oh, that's all arranged. Arranged? Seaside Hotel, supper for two... - Oh, Reggie you darling. Not yet. Reggie, I'm beginning to feel so wicked! So am I. Oh, Reggie. You understand that isn't really... Oh, I know, we're just playing. My car's at the garden gate. Let's take that. Alright. Won't some people be surprised? I hope so. I overheard him making a date for this very evening! You wait and see. Well listen darling, I should run an important business. So I'll run along. I'll call you later. - Goodbye, sweetheart. Goodbye darling. Oh, there you are. Where's that little wretch Reggie? I'm going to send him packing out of my life. - Now, Angie... - I'm done with him. He'd made me a laughingstock. - Oh, there he is! - Really? - Getting into a car. - Alone? No, there's a woman in it. A woman? Why, it's Nita Leslie! The little hussy! Oh, Reggie, how I've wronged you! I beg your pardon, where is Nita? - Her car's starting. - They're going away together. Oh, Reggie, how I misjudged you! - What is it, what's the matter? - The matter? Nothing is the matter. Everything is perfect! My Reggie has just eloped with you Nita. What? Isn't it grand? Oh, and they're taking their suitcases! I'll murder him. Can you take us to the Seaside Hotel? What? The hotel down here. Hey! Seaside hotel! How much do I owe you? Hey? How much do I owe you? Do you think two dollars would be too much? Yes. Well, give me a dollar. I'm Mr. John Smith and wife. Oh. Would you like two rooms? Oh no, I'll only be here one night. Do you prefer single or twin beds? Which is best? How do you generally sleep? On my back. Then I'll give you a double bed. I'm Mr. Haywood's Mr John Smith and wife. Oh, you're that Mr. and Mrs. John Smith. Well, why didn't you say so before so? Now, if you kindly register I will take care of you immediately. For right here, Mr. Smith. We'll take care of you immediately. - Maybe I better sign in again. - Ah yes, I think you better... Uh, just... It must be raining out, isn't it? Uh, boy. Will you take care of these people, please. Where do I take them, to the laundry? No, room 636. That's my hat. It's my hat. You go and get him. Hey, you got in there... Thank you. I'm alright now. I'm alright now. - You're alright, Mr. Smith? Anything else, sir? No, thanks. No supper, nothing to eat? Oh, yeah. Bring wine. - Shh! Not so loud. What's the matter? I'll get ten years if I'm caught selling that stuff. Well if you don't get caught how much will it cost? 15 dollars a quart. Bring champagne. - That's 20 dollars a quart. - Bring wine. Should've been beer, I told him. Hey, what are ya gonna eat? Lobster. Yeah? The lady too? - Yeah. - That's three lobsters. No. One for me and the lady too. The lady two, that's three lobsters. I guess you'll have to eat two lobsters. Sure you can spare this? Say, umm... Do you favor your father or your mother? - Oh, my mother. - Yeah? My father left town the day before I was born. Probably knew what was coming. Oh, Reggie, give me a hanky. Oh, I'm so afraid of thunder and lightning. I don't care for them either. Oh, Reggie, I'm so wet. Maybe you better take that coat off. Reggie. I wish I had something dry to put on. Maybe there's something in the grip. Why, Reggie! How did you happen to have these in your suitcase? Oh, I always carry those things. Reggie. You wicked, wicked man. Where will I change? Looks like a bed! It is a bed. Oh, Reggie, I feel so wicked. Reggie, help me unhook dress. - Huh? - Help me unhook my dress. Reggie. Behave. Reggie, don't look. Go into the other room and shut the doors. Headache? Oh, no. I was just playing. With the wife. I bet you two have a lot of fun together. Here's you wine and your lobster. The lobster's only got one big claw. They lose one sometimes in a fight, you know. Why didn't you bring me the winner? Anything else, sir? Yeah, uh, I want you to take the Mrs' clothes out and have them dried. Okay. Don't you dare come in. Gimme your clothes so I send them down and have them dried. I'll give you the clothes but don't you dare come in. She doesn't want me to come in. I noticed that. How about you? You better change too. Don't you dare come out here. Still playing, huh? May I come out now? Yeah, come out now. Kiss. Oh, Reggie. You know, you said you wouldn't really do that. It's in the book. The book? Oh, kid, sweetheart, baby. Reggie, you shouldn't say such things. Something here about your knee. My knee? Or maybe it's my knee. Oh, oh, I know what it is. You stand up. - Oh, Reggie, I mustn't. - It's alright, it's in the book. Oh, Reggie, you mustn't! No! I have to because she probably be here now any minute. - Oh, Reggie, let me go! - Come here! Don't turn around like that! Oh, Reggie, please let me go! Let me get out of here! Oh, Reggie, don't you dare! Don't you dare to get nearer to me. - Oh, please, I don't care about you! - You can't go back there! - Oh, please! - They probably be here in , they... - They probably be here in... - Freddy! - I'll call Freddy on you! - Come 'ere now! Don't you dare! - Let me out of here! - Come here! Oh, Reggie! Please, go away! Don't you dare come in here! You can't do that. You have to come out here, you gotta be here when she arrives! Reggie! Reggie. You are Reggie, aren't you? Yes, ma'am. This is gonna be easy. Now come here now, don't be scared. I'm not gonna kidnap you or give you the needle. You're just as safe with me as you would be in jail. Jeff Haywood said it. - Jeff Haywood. - Yes. - Jeff Haywood? - Mm hmm. He...He sent you here? Yes. What about...? What about what? Nothing. You know, when Jeff warned me about you I didn't believe that it could be true, but he was right. He was right. Now, he's explained everything to me and I'm gonna coach you. Coach me. Yes, we're gonna have a little rehearsal. Rehearsal. A little practice. Practice. Do you know what we're here for? Do something to deceive Angelica, huh? Huh? What you're supposed to do now is to make love to me. Where do I begin? Up in Minnie's room. First you seize me. One arm around my neck. Comme ci, comme ça. Oh, come and get this, are you anchored? I am here for a quiet evening. You know, you are dead and you won't lay down. I'm not here to give you dancing lessons. Come here. Oh. Try that now. Your rough work is funny. I didn't mean to hurt you. Clinch, will you clinch? Get a Half Nelson. What's the matter with this thing? Hasn't it ever been used? Now, say something like this. Darling. I love you madly. I cannot live without you. You must never leave me. Now you do that. Darling. I love you madly. I cannot live without you. You must never leave me. You have all the passion of an infuriated clam. Get up there! What do you think you're doing? This is a love scene. Oh, say it as if you really meant it. Say darling. I love you madly. I cannot live without you. You must never leave me. I'll get you a piece of meat. Send up a hip of a horse. Oh, c'mon now, you know what to say. Say it. C'mon, say it. Oh, my darling. I love you madly. I cannot live without you.

I can't believe it. But look! C'mon and quickly get dressed. Your husband may be here any time! Oh, but I can't go out without my clothes! They're drying them. Oh, phone for them. Quickly Nita, hurry! I'll take care of Reggie. - Oh, you better be careful. He's a terrible, terrible man! Reggie Irving, do you realize you had that little girl scared sick? I thought she acted a little bit nervous. What on earth is the matter with you? Why didn't you pick up a grown up woman, somebody who knows how to play the game? Oh, my darling. I love you madly. I cannot live without you. You must never leave me! Oh, he's a Mormon! Reggie. Irving, are you losing your mind? Reggie! Reggie Irving, get off of me! So, I was right about you, Leila. All the time. What have you done with Nita? Nita? Yes, Nita. Where is she? Oh, Nita came with me but she didn't know how to play the game and Leila volunteered. Why, you little shrimp! If you'd only listen to me, I came here to save Nita from this- this monster. And the only way you could save Nita was to take Nita's place on Reggie's lap. Oh, don't be a fool, Angie. I didn't know you had company. Reggie! How could you, Reggie? Oh! You promised me cross your heart that you were gonna cut out all these society dolls! Why did you lie to me, darling? Why did you lie to me? Why, why Why? What is Reggie to you? Nothing much. We're gonna be married next week. Oh, darling, how could you? You can't do this to me.
