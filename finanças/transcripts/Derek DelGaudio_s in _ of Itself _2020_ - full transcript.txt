And this friend, he took me to a small bar, and it was there that I was introduced to a stranger. And this stranger, he told me a story. He told me a story about a sailor who returned home after the Great War, and this sailor quickly discovered the only thing more difficult than fighting in a war was surviving one. 'Cause for him, without a war to fight, he felt lost. So the sailor searched for himself at the bottom of a bottle only to find himself with no friends, no family, no prospects. So one day, at the end of his rope, this desperate man, he turned to a game of chance. A game of Russian Roulette. The game was highly illegal, but it was organized. The players would enter their names at the door. And when a player's name was drawn, they'd be escorted into a dark room full of a bunch of strangers. The strangers would proceed to place bets. They would decide the value of the player's life. Once all the bets were collected, a single bullet was ceremoniously loaded into one of six empty chambers of a pistol, the chambers then closed and spun, the pistol handed to the player who had one job: place the gun to your head, pull the trigger. Your odds of surviving this game, of winning were five in six. And if you won, you were handsomely rewarded. All your troubles were over. And if you lost, all your troubles were over. So‐‐ [audience laughs] First time this sailor played, he won, but no one noticed him. And no one paid any attention to him. But the second time, second time he played, people started to pay attention. And mostly because nobody who won this game ever came back the next day. And the third time that this man played and won, that was the night, that was the night the people gave him the name. They started calling this man the Rouletista. [gun clicking] [clicking] The fourth night, the fourth night, the crowd nearly doubled in size. Word spread of this guy. And people just wanted to see what the fuss was about. So again, the people, they all placed their bets, and again he played. [whirring] Click. And again he won. It was about this time people started to speculate, okay, maybe this guy figured out a way to cheat at this game. Or may‐‐ or maybe the organizers of the game, they just rigged it for him to win, you know, drum up some promotion for their own business. So people got smart, they stopped betting, they stopped playing altogether. So the Rouletista, without anyone asking him to do this, he said he'd be willing to add a second bullet to the gun. So people took the bet. And again he played. [whirring] Click. And again he won. He agreed to add a third bullet. This time, no one really cared if he was cheating, you know. [audience laughs] People just wanted to be able to say that they got to place a bet against him. [whirring] Click. He added a fourth bullet. And a fifth. Eventually, he agreed to add a sixth and final bullet. Yet nobody bet. No. Instead, they just bought a ticket to watch, you know. Watch a man stand on a stage and place a loaded gun to his head. Believe it or not, for the first time in a hundred years, there was an earthquake in that region. [rumbling] The building shook so hard‐‐ [rattling, crashing] A beam fell right from the ceiling, knocked the gun right out of the Rouletista's hand. [whirring] He took this as a sign. That was the night he retired. But he, he was wealthy at this point, though. So he got married. [audience laughs] He had some kids. Got himself some grandkids. He lived in the biggest house on the highest hill in his town. People, when they saw him, they would cross the street just to come shake the man's hand or to get the hell away from him. He w‐‐ he was a living legend. One night, he was asleep in his bedroom, he heard someone downstairs rummaging around. He went down to investigate, only to discover a burglar was down there trying to break into his safe. The burglar stood up and pointed a gun at the Rouletista. [whirring] Rouletista looked back at the man and said, "Do you know who I am?" Burglar replied, "No." [gunshot] Fired a single shot. Killed the Rouletista right there in his own home. That's it. That's the story. [audience laughs] This is a story the stranger told me at this little bar. And I looked at him and said, "That's a fascinating tale, sir. "Why did you tell me that? Wha‐‐ what made you think of this?" And he, he looked at me and in all seriousness replied, "Because you are the Rouletista." I had my friend translate that. Perhaps I misunderstood him. And he just repeated himself, "No, "you are the Rouletista. I just thought you should know." And he left. And that night, I stared into a mirror trying to see the man that he saw, but all I could see is the same thing I see every single day. I‐‐ I've retraced the footsteps of that encounter over and over again, looking for clues as to why he might have said that. I didn't say but two words to him. I wasn't dressed like a sailor, you know. I didn't put a gun to my head. So what was it? What did he hear that I didn't tell him? Or what did he see in me that I didn't show him?

On, on, on every ship, there is a book. And this book is called the ship's log. And it was, it was the sailor's job to write down everything that happened on a journey. They were supposed to write it down inside of this book. But long before modern instruments, this book, it wasn't just a record of the journey. It was a really important part of navigation. Because sailors used the stars and the sun to navigate. They would determine their location, and then they would write those coordinates down inside of this book. But from time to time, on a journey, sometimes clouds would fill the sky and it would be impossible for them to determine where they were But on these days, they still needed to make an entry in this book. So on these days, sailors were forced to imagine where they were. And they had to write that down. And they relied heavily on the previous entries to help keep them on course. Eventually, the clouds would part, they'd find the stars again, get back on track, arrive at their destination. But the, the end result for that book, it told an honest story of the journey that had taken place, but it was comprised entirely of information that was both real and imagined. We have a book.

The full grip, straddle grip, box grip, dealer grip? I couldn't decide. So, I just learned them all. Taught myself how to shuffle. You take one and another and another. Eventually, I could speed up.

Hey, Reflection. Could you please stand up. And if you could just turn around real quick. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what a reflection looks like. [audience laughing, applauding] Thank you very much, Reflection. There's a story you should know. There's a story all of us, all of us should know. This story is about these six dudes. And these dudes, they're walking through a field, and they come across a thing, and they don't know what this thing is. So these guys decide instead of just moving along, instead of just minding their own damn business, these guys decide they're gonna stop, they're going to investigate. And by God, they're gonna figure out what this thing is. There's a‐‐ there is a problem with their idea. All six of these guys are blind. And even though they're all touching the same thing, they're all touching a different part of it. So each guy thinks it's a totally different thing. For instance, the guy at the front of this thing, he's touching this part. Feels all long and round. Gets thicker towards the top. It's kinda rough, almost scaly. It's wet at the tip. "Oh, hey, guys, back up. It's an enormous snake." The guy at the opposite end, at the back end, he feels something similar but different. It is long and round back here. It's not very thick though. It's kind of the same width all the way up. It's fuzzy at spots. It's fluffy at the end. "Hey, man, it's not a snake. It's just rope. Don't freak us out." And the guy touching the side of this thing, this guy is touching the big broad side of this thing. This thing is so big and so heavy and hard when he presses up against it, it doesn't budge, doesn't move an inch. So this guy, he thinks it's a wall. And the guy just below that, he's got his arms around this part here. "That feels like a tree trunk, gentlemen." There's another one and another and another. "It's four tree trunks, guys." And the guy on top of this thing‐‐ I don't, I don't know why there was a guy on top of this thing. [audience laughs] But he's up there. He's feeling around, and he feels this part here. Feels, feels kinda leathery. Shaped like a fan. Oh, there's two of them. "It's like two big fans, guys." Anyways, the point being, these guys argue amongst themselves for quite a while, and it, it was not until they learned to communicate and work together that they were able to, you know, "see" the thing they were all touching is just an elephant. Now this, this is an old story. There's lots of versions of this really old story from all around the world. I have read every version of this story I could get my hands on, and I've noticed every version of this story has one thing in common. There's... there's not a single version of this story that takes into consideration what this experience must have been like for the elephant. [audience laughs] Think about it from its perspective for just a moment. Ima‐‐ imagine you are standing alone in a field minding your own business and six perverts come out of nowhere and start fondling you. [grumbling] And then they start arguing about what you are, and they can't decide. They can't figure it out. So they form a really creepy committee, and they discuss what you are. And they come back and go, "Hey, we talked about it. We figured it out You, you're an elephant, Elephant." [babbling] What if they're wrong? I mean, they are blind. Or in, or in this instance, what if they were right in the first place? What if these blind guys didn't stumble across an elephant? What if they really did stumble across a magical creature? Something that had a snake for a nose, and tree trunks for legs and a wall for a body, and then they just, they convinced each other it was just an elephant And worse than that, what if they could convince it it was just an elephant. And then what if this thing, what if this magical creature didn't have someone around who knew it, someone who saw it for what it really was and loved it enough to say, "No, they're all wrong, and you're more than that." I don't know. Maybe that's why we don't see those types of magical creatures roaming around anymore. Reflection, please join me on the stage. WOMAN: Hi. ‐ Pleasure to meet you. Uh, take a seat. I'm gonna grab my chair. I will explain what's happening. I've been doing my best. Uh, I've been doing my damnedest to keep an antiquated form of communication from going extinct. In other words, I've been having letters sent to me. And I have, [exhales forcefully] I have enough here for... almost everyone, but it doesn't matter. Uh, it doesn't matter 'cause each day, each performance we only get to open one, and today you have been selected to decide which of these we're gonna open. So please go through, decide on one you'd like to open, and keep it for yourself. MAN: This one. DEREK: Okay. I'll take the rest. I'm just gonna point out a few things that you can see right now that most of them can't. First of all, you may have noticed, all of these are actually addressed to me, to Derek DelGaudio, care of the Daryl Roth Theatre. That's me. That's this place. Second, you may have noticed all of the return addresses have been removed. And finally, if you turn it over on the back, you'll see this says "Cousin," "Friend." What does yours say? ‐ Sister. DEREK: Sister. ‐ Grandfather. ‐ Grandfather. Sibling. Do you have any siblings" ‐ Yes. ‐ This is a rude question. Do you have any friends? ‐ I think so. ‐ You think so. Okay, good. I have to ask. What does yours say? ‐ Father. ‐ Father. Do‐‐ uh, do you have a father? ‐ I do. ‐ Is he here with you tonight? ‐ He is not. ‐ Perfect. Okay. Freak, two things are about to happen. Uh, these two things are gonna happen almost simultaneously. One of these things, you will see. And the other thing, we will see. Uh, here is what you are about to see happen. Right now, you're holding an envelope. And presumably, inside of that envelope is a folded card or piece of paper. But in a moment, you're gonna open that up, you're gonna unfold whatever's in there. And when you do, you're gonna see this thing transform into a handwritten letter to you from your father. From your friend. From your nephew. From your son. From your cousin. From your sister. From your child. [audience laughs] None of us will see that. Only she will see that. What the rest of us will see, in my opinion, it's, it's better. In a moment, you're gonna open that up. And when you see this thing transform, we get to see you, the reflection‐‐ The conceptual artist. The teacher. The pediatrician. The lieutenant. The unicorn. The dog lover. The fighter. Transform into... something else. Okie‐dokie. Uh‐‐ [audience laughs] You don't even need to read that aloud. That's just for you to read. But we are gonna watch. I will be right here if you need anything at any moment. [audience laughs] [scattered laughter] ‐ Ohh. What? ‐ No! ‐ What the fuck! [audience laughs] ‐ How‐‐ [audience laughs] [laughs] ‐ Uh, okay.

It's easy to feel that way in this particular moment, but I, uh, I assure you it is quite the contrary, because in a few moments, all of this, all of this, it's gonna end for all of them. And whether they all know it or not, when this ends, they will have decided what it is. And they will have decided what I am. But not you. But not you. But not you. But not you. For you, this is gonna remain a mystery a little bit longer, and this story is gonna continue now 'cause you're gonna take it with you, and... that means it could be whatever you want it to be. I'd like you to write down what you saw here up until this moment. Just as you saw. Like a recap for us. And then, more importantly, I want you to imagine how this story ends. Uh, it can be anything you want. Give us an ending. I will have you read that imaginary ending to the nice people that come tomorrow. And then some day, if someone were to read all of this, it's gonna tell 'em an honest story of everything that has ever happened here, even though it's composed entirely of information that is both real and imagined.
