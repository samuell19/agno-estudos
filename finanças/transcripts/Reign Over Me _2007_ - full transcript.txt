New patient? Yes. I was referred by my lawyer about veneers. Heh. You're a new patient, that's all I need to know. Fill this out so we know who to contact in case we lose you in the chair. Uh? That was a joke, sweetie. I was being funny. Hello. Mrs. Remar, I'm Dr. Johnson. Oh, it's Miss Remar. And I know who you are. I see another doctor in the building regularly. Oh. I've been on the elevator with you a few times. Oh, okay. You're married? I never noticed the ring before. Oh, yes, I am. I'm married. All right, what are we doing for you today? Uh, one veneer, is that right? Oh, they told me you don't usually do just one. We do whatever's needed. Allie. All right. Let's see. Now, which one is it? I don't know. You tell me. So another cutie with a crush, huh? What is it with you? What is it with...? Zzz-zzz. Hmm? Oh. So, uh, you'll be back next week? Uh, you're gonna schedule Miss Remar next week for the veneer. Right? Yeah. I'm gonna clear the schedule the whole week so that you could be mentally prepared for it. Okay? It was so nice to finally meet you. Oh, yeah. You too. Okay. I need the... Oh, it's my daughters. I... I'm gonna need that jacket. Uh, okay, you stay, and then I'll reach. Sorry. No, that's fine. I'm minutes away. Charlie...? Hey, Charlie! Charlie Fineman! Charlie! Charlie. Charlie Fineman. Come on! I'm so sick of your father. He's in that bed again. Just as mean and evil as he can be. Like a pig with a bullet in his head. You take your walk today, Mom? I'll take that as a no. Dad? I hate this city. I hate this damn city. I don't know why you brought us here. I got the papaya juice you asked for. Hate this damn city. And the smell. All that garbage all up and down the street. Daddy? I need money for the dress for the dinner I'm going to with the Jacobsons. And you'll have to drive me because Mom's gonna be at Cherie's chorus practise. Okay. And we have to talk about getting a new cell phone. This morning, you said we could talk about it tonight. I thought we talked about the cell phone issue. But I'm 13 and I still share with my little sister. Oh, right. Because you only need a cell phone if Mommy or Daddy's late... I ran into Charlie Fineman today. Really? How is he? I don't know. I was in the car and he was on foot. He was coming out of a hardware store. He was carrying paint. You think he's still practising? Who's Charlie Fineman, Daddy? Uh, he's an old college friend of mine, baby. Uh... He was my college roommate, actually. I haven't talked to him in a long, long time. Is he the one from dental school, whose family was on the plane? Is that Charlie Fineman? Yeah. That's Charlie Fineman. You know, I decided to sign us up for another photography class. You... You did? You already... You already signed us... Signed us up? Yeah, but this time for the advanced one. I thought we had fun last quarter, didn't you? Mm-hm. What, you don't want to? No, I do. Don't... Don't you? I loved it. I had a really good time. Yeah. Didn't you love it? I did. And now Advanced Photography? I mean, wow. I'm... Yeah. Good. No sugar. Don't take that to school, okay? Whole Foods. Whole Foods snacks. Hey, Angela. Dr. Johnson. What is it about us always leaving the building at the same time? It's quitting time. That's... That's true. You good? Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. Good. Let me ask you something. Most married men, they have hobbies. Okay, Alan, Alan. Don't do this. Come on. Don't do what? We talked about this. I mean, it's not really fair for you to wait for me out here on the street. If you wanna make an appointment, we can make an appointment. Yeah, I know. But it's a little thing. Just a little thing. Now, you remember the friend I was asking you about? The friend who has no friends? Other than you? Yeah, him. So he's a married guy, right? And he's got... He's got a great wife and the whole nine. But she will not let him... I mean, it's like he can't just... I mean, guys have guy hobbies, right? They play poker, they golf, they do shit. Okay, you know what? Stop. Stop. I can't treat you from the lobby to the car park. Treat me? I'm not... I just asked you a question. Okay, well, whatever you wanna call it... No, you're right. I get it. It's inappropriate. You're right. I get it. I get it. But let me ask you one thing. I want your... I want your opinion as a woman, Angela. As a woman. Look, if I have this recurring dream where... I'm sitting on my couch, and... And it turns into a big vat of rubber, what is that? Why don't you let me refer you to someone else? Okay. Well, I hope it works out for you. You wait for me enough times out on the street, though, you might owe me some dental work. Have a nice day. Bingo. There we go. That was a tough one. Okay. Absolutely. Now it all will fall into place. Dad, can you take me to Becky Fishman's? Sweetie, it's 9:30. She wants me to spend the night. Well, Daddy's had a long day at work, and he's finally finding some time to enjoy himself. Just have her come over here. And we can study your French together. Oh, you know what? I'll... I'll take her. I'll go. Babe. We've come this far. We've been working on this all week. No, I know, I know. I'll go. I'll... I'll go, and then I'll just come right back. All right. Don't be mad if I have this all done by the time you get back. Because I'm on a roll here. You're gonna miss out on all the action. Just make sure you save me some sky, okay? Uh-huh. You know you owe that child bigtime. You would've thought she got you out of traffic school by the look on your face. Good night, babe. Good night. Thanks. Oh. Hey, Charlie. Char... Charlie. Charlie Fineman, hey! Charlie, stop! Hey, Charlie. Hey, man. Yeah? It's Alan. Hey. How are you? I saw you coming out of a paint store a couple weeks ago and, uh... I was screaming for you, honking the horn and everything. I stopped the car, jumped out in traffic. It was crazy. Oh, yeah. Then I tried to... To get in touch with you, but nobody had, uh, any info on you. Oh, good, good. Very cool. How you doing? So we know each other? Are you kidding me? It's Alan Johnson, Charlie. We went to dental school together. Burrows Hall. I was your college roommate, for chrissake. You don't remember me? Yeah, very cool. Very cool. Good. Good to see you, Burrows. It's Johnson. Charlie, you seriously don't remember me? We were college roommates? Yeah. Yeah, you slept naked most nights. And you were a sleepwalker. It was the worst two years of my life. Hey, are you practising, man? I... I tried to get in touch with you through the Dental Guild, but they didn't... I'm practising all the time, up in the valley. Took down 12 of the Colossus so far. The valley? What is that? Is that a medical complex or something? It's more like another dimension. You take a journey and discover yourself. Hey, man, you wanna go get a drink? I can't drink. I can't drink. I can't drink. I can't drink. I... I gotta get going. Then a coffee or something. Let's just go get a cup of coffee. Real quick. I... I would just love to... To catch up with you, man. Hey, Charlie. This okay? You like trivia? Name the Great Lakes. The w... Great Lakes. Can you name them? Um... Okay, Michigan is one. Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie and Superior. That was an easy one. That's fifth-grade shit. So, what have you been up to lately, Charlie? I'm stuck between Pale White and Moon White. I tried Butterscotch Yellow. I couldn't live with it. You painting something? You're remodelling or? You were my college roommate. That was a long time ago. A whole other life. Oh, yeah. No shit. It's good to see your face. Johnson. Yeah, it's good to see you too, Charlie. Yeah. All right. You gotta take those shoes off. Oh. Thank you. Great record collection. Yeah. I'm happy with it. A lot of vinyl. Yeah. Over 5500 so far. It's a work in progress. Kitchen remodel? What is this? This, uh... "Shadows of the Colossus." Can I use your bathroom, Charlie? Oh, in the back. Nice music room. Mm. Mm. Good? Okay. Ahem. There you go, Allie. Thank you. I'm sorry about the way I behaved the last time I was here, doctor. But when I see you in the building, you always seem very busy. Preoccupied. Even when you're with the other doctors, you seem so solitary. So alone. I don't know why, but that seems very familiar to me. Yeah. Well. I, uh, hope you're... I just thought that if you wanted me to, I would. With my mouth. I would. You could lock that door, tell the nurse not to come in. I'd do it. I'd enjoy making you happy. You... You... You have to leave. I have this odd sense of intimacy towards you. I don't even know why. Yeah. I told my shrink about it, and she said I should act on it. Oh, she did? Well, you need to get a new shrink. Get several. And get a new dentist too. Uh, you gotta get out of here, Miss Remar. No, I'm serious. I need you to leave right now. Please. Go. Okay. Come on. Okay. The fuck...? I... I... I need you, uh, not to reschedule Miss Remar for anything. Okay. Uh... Uh... E-ever again. Nothing. I heard... Okay. I mean, I... I don't want this woman as a patient of mine. Got it. I got it. Fine. Thank you. Excuse me! Not right now. Hey. Melanie, call her. Miss Remar? On the phone, I mean. Don't... Miss Remar, you need to find another dentist. Excuse me? - You heard me. Dr. Johnson don't want you as a patient, neither do any other doctors here as well, so go somewhere, bury your face in the phone book, and find another dentist, all right? "Bury your face in the phone book"? Yes. You have to be bold to make these kind of people go away. Thanks for holding. Can I help you? I'm just going up to see a friend of mine, Charlie Fineman. Uh-huh. Nobody by that name lives here. Sorry. That's fine. I'll just wait for the landlord or something. That's me. Landlady. Adell Modell, landlady from hell. Oh, well, I'm Alan Johnson. I'm a friend of Charlie's. Sure. We went to dental school together... We... Heh. I was in his apartment the other night. We were playing, um... Uh, Shadows of the Colossus or something. You were up there in his apartment the other night? That's a load of crap. He hasn't had anybody up there in four years. Just me, Sugarman the accountant, the cleaning girl. He doesn't even know about the cleaning girl. I'm not lying to you. I was up there. Yeah. Uh... H-he's remodelling his kitchen. Now, how would I know that? He's been remodelling that kitchen once every couple of months. That tells me nothing. Go away. Johnson. Johnson! Yo. Hey. Alan! Alan Johnson. This is my college roommate. It's my college roommate. I used to sleep in the nude. Oh. Check this out. I got a... You'll appreciate this. The Pretenders. It's one of the great debut albums of all time. Yeah, that's you. Terrible taste in music. No, no, not true. Not true. Ah, smell these things. Oh, I love the way they smell. Take a whiff. Brings back a feeling. Smells like the late '70s, don't it? Lt... The early '80s. Yeah. Heh. Charlie! Charlie! It's okay. It's okay, Charlie. I'll take care of them. No. No. Who's that? Charlie, we just wanna talk. We gotta go. What? We gotta go. Wh... Why? Who is that? Johnson, hop on. Hop on, Johnson. Hop on? Get on. Get on. Johnson. Who is that? Johnson, damn it, get on. Get on. Just get on the back. Wait a minute! Wait a minute. He's gonna go... Charlie! Charlie! Bus, Charlie! Oh, shit! Charlie. Oh. I know, I know. All right. You're late. They're pissed. Name the one national U.S. Monument that's movable. Suck my ass, retard. You're late. Get in there. No. San Francisco cable cars. Good. Yeah. I didn't know that one either. That's a good one. That's a great one if you ever wanna stump somebody. I... I... If you guys could really not laugh at anything I say, that would really... I'm trying to get my self-esteem to go to, uh, like, uh, seven percent. Could I get another Heineken? You want another root beer? I got... I got enough. Thanks. Thanks. Hey, it was fun watching you up there tonight, man. Aw. It was good music. I don't know if I'd go that far. But you know what it reminded me of? It reminded me of school. When you used to jam to that, uh... That Bruce Springsteen album. What was the name of that album? Bruce Springsteen... Yeah. What was that? The River. The River? The River. You remember that? I was always trying to get you to play The O'Jays or Earth, Wind & Fire, but you always wanted to jam to... To The River. I don't remember jamming to it. Yeah, maybe if you smelled it, it'd all come rushing back. Right. Ha-ha-ha. This was fun, man. Oh, yeah. I had a good day today. Riding around on that silly scooter. It was... It was my first time doubles. Ha-ha-ha. It was fun. It was fun. Yeah. I don't do anything like that. Lot of girls here, Charlie. That's gotta be half of the appeal, right? Why'd you ask me that? I don't... I don't know. I'm just making small talk, you know? I mean, you're single now. You can do whatever you... What? After what happened with your family and everything... Oh. Whoa, hey, I don't have a family, Johnson. No. No, I know. I was... I was just trying to make small talk, but that was stupid. Who sent you here? Did they send you here? Who...? What are you talking about? Are you a specialist? A sp...? No, I'm not... What are you talking about? Hey, don't lie to me! Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me. Charlie, calm down. Why are you here? Why? Why? Answer my fucking question. Charlie, you're screaming. Why are you here right now talking to me?! Relax. Okay? Why? Why? Shit! - Oh. The fuck is wrong with you? Why are you talking to me? Oh, now I'm boring you? Mr. Heckler? I'm bored too. I'm sorry if I'm boring you. I'm sorry. You tell them to leave me alone! Ahem. Alan. When you get a minute, we need to see you. Alan, this is bad. The woman sent us a letter, threatened to file a lawsuit. So she claims that you sexually assaulted her in the office on several occasions. That is ridiculous, all right? That's absurd. Well, we checked with Melanie. Donna Remar. What do you know about her? This woman is insane. Okay? She came in, I put a single veneer on her, she tells me she's got this obsession... She wants... Excuse me, Marie. She said she wants to give me oral sex in the office. You know what, you need to make this go away. We can't handle a hit like this on our insurance. And even if we win, we're gonna get killed. How do I do that? How do I make this go away? I don't know how you make it go away. But you see her again, you discuss it... You know, damn. I mean, isn't this exactly like what it was the last time? Woman falls in love with you, you lead them along... You know what, John? No. No. What, Johnson? I'll get into it. Dr. Johnson? I need to speak with you. Um... I'm Ginger Timpleman, and I'm Charlie Fineman's mother-in-law. Did you know Charlie's family? No, uh- His parents died when he was in grade school. He has an aunt that he lived with before college. I met her a couple of times. She passed just before the wedding. You know, my wife and I, we tried to call him so many times. Hadn't seen him in years, and I-I read about what happened in the paper, and I was just... I was... I was just heartbroken for him, you know? For them. He just, you know, shut down. Quit work. He stopped wanting to talk about her. Then he acted like he didn't remember them. Then he pretended he didn't remember us. Yeah. All my husband and I wanna do is see him. And that crazy landlady and his business manager, Sugarman, both conspire to keep us away. Sugarman? Yeah, I don't care for him. Heh. Who knows what that little shyster's taking from Charlie. What is there to take? Between the government payout, the insurance policy, Charlie has enough to take care of himself, put it that way. My husband retired young. He was a cop. You know, we were young. Young to be grandparents. I was gonna do nothing but travel and spoil my granddaughters. Then those monsters flew over here from across the world and rearranged my dance card. Sorry. Of course you are. But he needs help. Not the kind that landlady and some little accountant can give him. He needs a therapist. And he needs family. Guess what. Jonathan and I are the only family Charlie's got. Hey. Hey. Wha... What? Somebody's at the door. Somebody's at the door. Cherie. Cherie. Get away from the door. What are you doing? You don't go to the door in the middle of the night. You know that. I think it's Charlie Fineman. Is that Charlie? Oh, yeah, that's him. Okay. So let him in. Yeah? Were you in bed already? What's going on? It's 10:30. I'm always in bed at 10:30. That sucks. That's grim. You don't have any root beer on you, do you? No, why? Alan. Charlie, this is my wife, Janeane. Hi, I believe we met about 15 years ago in Central Park. I don't expect you to remember it. I don't. Okay. This is our daughter Cherie. Nice to meet you, Dr. Fineman. Go to bed, sweetheart. What's going on, Charlie? You wanna go out, man? Go have some fun? Let's hang out. Right now? Yeah, wake up. Come on. Let's ha... Can he go out? Is he allowed out? Charlie, don't do that. Don't ask my wife permission for me to go out. I'm standing right here in front of you. I'm not 7 years old. Oh, you're right. Can you go out? She's threatening to sue you? Wha... Uh... Uh... What does she want? She wants to go down on me. Well... Well, you tell her you can't do that. No, I know. You tell her you're married? She knows. It's not a deterrent for this one. I mean, she's, uh, got some kind of a fixation or something. Oh, well, fix it for her. It's not funny, Charlie. No, no, no. It's really not funny, I mean... No, no. Uh, my partners are up my ass. Right. We already pay an obscene amount in liability insurance. You should tell your partners they can do to you what the girl wants to do. Fuck them. I don't know. It's a five-year lease, 50 grand a month, my name on it. Yeah? My partners get pissed off, and they leave me holding the bag, that's it, I'm done. Yeah. You know I put the whole thing together. They act like I'm the one who works for them. Yeah. Oh, uh... But the girl, what are you gonna do about that? That... That... That's weird, you know? It's... It's kind of heavy. Yeah, it is. I'm telling you, this girl's seriously troubled. Oh, yeah. S-S-She got a lot of problems if she wants to blow you. She's out of her mind. I've seen that thing. Uh-oh. Oh. That's very funny. No, no, no. No, it is fun... Are you having fun? I, heh... To tell you the truth, I kind of am, Johnson. I, uh... It's nice to see you in the soup like this. It's funny. Just not used to it. Here. Take it easy. Take it easy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Any chance of you getting audited this week? Because that would make things even better. O-or maybe we could go somewhere, and you could burn your tongue on some pizza. I'd like that too. I would love that. M... Ca... I need you to hold for one moment. You are not gonna believe who this is on the phone. Who? The nut. Okay, but at this point in my life, you're gonna have to be very specific. Donna Remar. She wants to come in for another consultation for some more veneers. Can you believe that? Ma'am? M-ma'am? Schedule it. Excuse me? Schedule it in my office alone. Morning, Oscar. Hey, doc. Good to see you. Hello, Dr. Johnson. Hello. Uh, I've got a question. I'm sure you do. No, it's not about me this time. How refreshing. It's... It's about a friend. Really, though. I mean, really, a real friend. Uh... He lost his whole family in a plane crash. Right. It's horrible. I mean, his wife, his three daughters. This guy used to be a dentist. How long ago? It's a few years ago, and he's lost now. You know? He's completely lost. I bumped into him. We used to be college roommates for two years. He didn't even remember me. Well, offhand, that sounds like post-traumatic stress disorder. Maybe worse. Yeah. I couldn't really know without seeing him. It sounds like he needs help. Is he getting help? I don't know. I mean, the whole thing is... It's... It's really odd, you know? It's crazy odd. How are you? I'm fine. I got nothing to complain about. Does that mean you're fine? Very good. You are gonna be sending me a bill one day. You might wanna check your mailbox. Okay. Dr. Johnson, I think it would be really good for you to talk to someone. I just sense that it would be good for you to be a little bit more communicative. I hope that didn't offend you. Okay. Well, I'll see you soon? Mm-hm. Okay. Charlie. In the back! Hope the shoes are off. Shoes are off. Shoes are off. Hey, the kitchen's looking good, man. You almost done? Is that The River? Yeah. You know, I gotta get you enrolled in a music-appreciation class. Oh, right, yeah. Tell that to Clarence Clemons. Ha-ha. What's going on? What's going on with the girl? The crazy girl, the one who wants your penis. How's she doing? Uh, let... Let's not talk about her. Not gonna do that. Yeah, yeah, you wanna...? Lose that tie. Lose the tie and the scarf. The whole outfit. For what? Come on, take it off. Psychedelic time. Psychedelic time. Oh. I smell a Fineman jam session coming on. Yeah, Burrows Hall-style. Burrows Hall. Jamming and jamming and jamming. Here. I don't play guitar, Charlie. Hey, Johnson, you're barely a dentist. You pull people's teeth all day. It don't matter. Come on. Come on. All right. Get that in you. Get that in you. Let me do this. You'll get to this. Come on. Let me hear some of that. I don't know how to play this. Charlie Fineman! Alan Johnson. Alan Johnson! Charlie Fineman! Good night, Jersey! Oh! Philadelphia. Philadelphia! Oh. Good night, Philly! Baby, I'm sorry. I messed up, but you know I don't ever do anything like that. I just didn't wanna call you and wake you up. I was... I was stuck in Charlie world. I couldn't... ...leave. This is not okay. You staying out all night, hah, it's not acceptable. I'm just saying, the... The guy's in a lot of pain. It's sad over there, baby. It's just... Just a sea of sadness. Yeah. Hi. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson. You don't have an appointment, sir? Oh, we're friends. W-what...? We were college roommates. And? I used to sleep in the nude. Charlie? All right, come in. I hear "Colossus." Hey. Hey, hey, buddy. Take the shoes off! I told you. I told you. Hey, didn't you just? All right. All right. Hey, let me try it. Hang on. Let me try it. Just watch me do it first. Let me... Let me... Let me just try it. Okay, how do you... How do you shoot it? Square is to stab him. That's the bird. You wanna shoot him, get his attention. All right. All right, get your arrow ready. And let me pluck him right in the uterus. Aim what? Ah! Tsk. Oh, fuck. I could show you how to do it, give you some hints, but I'll warn you, it's very addictive. Well, I don't have an addictive personality, so just show me how to do it. Is something I said funny? All right. That'll call your horse. The triangle is how you jump... Okay, okay, very good. All right. Stab his arm. I'm stabbing him in the arm. No, you gotta stab in the right spot. I'm stabbing it right there. You gotta be on the light. Shit. Now, see. Stab. That's not gonna work. I gotta climb this big son of a bitch... Look, just... Just put it down, all right? Rest. Next time you come over, you'll be even better. You gotta let it all soak in. No, no, no. There... Right now. No next. Now. I thought you don't have an addictive personality. Heh. That was the line of the night, man. You're an addict. Say it, man. Say you're an addict. Yeah, okay. I'm an addict. All right. Come on, now, stab his wing. Oh, God. Oh, I'm on your ass, bird. Stab his wing. All right. Yeah. Colossus! That's the first three, uh... Okay, now, wait. You said they get bigger too? They get... Well, no, it's different. It's like you're gonna use a bow and arrow more. Each Colossus will have different powers. What are we doing? Get more and more difficult. Wait a minute, Charlie, you said get a burger, man. I can't... I can't do this. I gotta... I gotta work in the morning. Yeah, so you'll work, you'll be tired. So what? This is like a marathon, man. It'll go till 5 in the morning. I can't... You'll go to sleep tomorrow night at 8:00 instead of 10:30. How's that? Is that enough sleep, you faggot? Hey, don't call me faggot. Are you a faggot? Quit saying faggot. You just... Don't say faggot. Don't just call people faggot. That's rude. To a gay guy it is. To you, it's just a funny word, like pound cake or pickle. You're a fucked-up dude, man. I'm a fucked-up dude? Okay. You really need some Mel. You need some Mel. I'll take one adult and one faggot. Come on, you really need to come in here. Johnson. Johnson. Okay. Good decision. Hey! The sheriff is a nig... What did he say? The sheriff is near. No. The sheriff is a nig... I... ♪ I ain't got no body ♪ ♪ And nobody cares for me ♪ He's out of his mind. Richard Pryor, he did his own thing. Well, I mean, they both did great, obviously, but it's... I can only imagine, if they would have done another one? Ah, Janeane's called 15 times. Hello? Hey, baby. Alan, where have you been? I've been calling you for the last three hours. I know. I know. I'm sorry. I... I had the phone off. I was in this Mel Brooks marathon. I've never laughed so hard in my life I gotta bring you down here. This thing is crazy. Alan, I need you to listen to me. Your father's died. What? And I've been trying to reach you... What did you just say? Your mother called here, a couple hours after you left, and... He died in his sleep, in his bed, and Mom's here with us now and she's very upset and she needs you. Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's de... He's dead? I'm sorry, baby. Where are the girls? They're with Mom on the couch. They're fine. I'll be home as soon as I can. Will you please hurry up? Yeah, I will. Everything cool? Uh... My dad just died. Died, like... dead? Yeah. You wanna go get some breakfast? Charlie, my father just died. Yeah. There's a store that's gonna open up soon. Sells kitchen counters. I wanna take you there. They got marble tops. Charlie, my father just died. Yeah, yeah, I know. I wanna hang, though. Come on. Let's not waste all this Mel. We just got a good dose of Mel. Are we hanging? No. We're not hanging. Oh, hey, let's get some Chinese. Come on, don't be such a pussy. All right, does everybody see what it is? Huh? Here it is. At the bottom. See? Good look. Huh? Huh? Come on. What do you think? Yeah. Johnson? Yep. I'm Sugarman. Bryan Sugarman? Oh, yeah. Did I catch you at a bad time? Well, I just came back from burying my father, but other than that... Cool. Let me just say up front, Alan, I make it my business to watch this guy's back. That's what I do. I look out for him. Okay. All right. Now, obviously, I can't stop him from doing this, without going down a very dangerous legal road. But rest assured, I'll do anything short of that to not give you a million dollars. I don't know what you're talking about. He wants me to give you a million dollars. He has that kind of money? That's none of your business. That's my business. That's what I do. We've already established that. I won't let him be manipulated. Su... Sugarman, calm down, okay? I don't want his million dollars. Tell him... Tell him I'm not mad at him and we're still friends, okay? Just tell him that. You're being straight? Yes. I don't need his million dollars, okay? Just tell him that. Okay. I like that. Okay, good, then I've done my job. Yeah. Good job. Come on in and have some food. Go ahead. Daddy, your friend is here. The one who acts like he's younger than JoJo. Tsk. Charlie Fineman? Honey, don't be like that, okay? Don't judge people. That's not polite. Hey. I'm sorry about your dad. Thanks. I... I... I behaved badly that night. I know I did. All right? I'm sorry. And you wanted to give me a million dollars to make up for it? I don't have any friends other than you, Johnson. I got you something. The River. Absolutely. And Quadrophenia. Yeah. Another album you used to torture me with. Quadrophenia changed my life, Johnson. That's a nice gift. Too late to go for the million? Hey, are you hungry? Yeah. Wanna get some breakfast? Yeah. Come on. All right. Just me and you here? Hey, everybody, this is Charlie. Charlie, this is everybody. Come on in. These guys are staying? Yeah, Charlie. Everybody's... Everybody's staying. Charlie Fineman for Dr. Johnson. We're having lunch today. We're having Chinese. I can't tell you how happy that makes me. The last time you were in a dental office, anyway? Need to schedule you for a cleaning? Heh. Come on. Let's go get something to eat. You miss it? Miss what? Nothing. Forget it. What? What? Just... Come on. Charlie, nothing, all right? Forget it. No, w-w-what do you think I missed, being a dentist? Do you? Why? Why what? Why... Why... Why are you asking me? A-are you trying to focus me? Is that it? Did they send you here to focus me? Did... Yeah. Yeah, you got me. That's it. I'm with the CIA, and this is Operation Focus Fineman. Are you kidding me? Better not be. Charlie, look, if we're gonna be friends, you have to be able to trust me, all right? Thought we were friends. We are friends. That's why I can't pretend all day that I don't know anything about you. Is that a threat, though, to not be friends? No. I'm saying friends talk to each other about what's going on in their lives. You're an asshole. Charlie... Hey, Charlie! What the fuck is wrong with you? Get out of here, man! Charlie, get the f... Ah! Okay, okay. Get out of here. Get out of here. Leave me alone! All right? Charlie, get out of here! Yeah. All right. Shut your mouth. What are you still doing in here? I told you to leave. Because this isn't your office. I left! This is public property. This isn't even close to public property. Yes, it is! Get out of here, man! And I'm about to call the police if you don't leave. Melanie, it's okay. Let me handle it. No, it's not! He's... Melanie, shut the damn window! Jesus. We can't keep doing this shit, Charlie. Look, I don't know what I said to you in there that got you so pissed off, but I'm sorry, Charlie, all right? All right. Jesus. I know. Dr. Johnson. Miss Remar. Is everything okay? Oh, yeah. Everything's good. Because I have an appointment scheduled. Just check in with Melanie. Maybe I should come back. No, no, it's... It's fine. Just check in. Check in with Melanie. The one who...? Doctor will see you in the office. That gorgeous girl wants to blow you? Charlie, come on. She wants to blow you? Look, get out... Come here. Are you crazy? Get out of here. Oh. Sh... She's gorgeous. Yeah, I know. The way you were talking about... I thought she was a beast or something. I gotta straighten this out, okay? All right, but t-tell me, how hot is that girl? Come on, let's not... She's fine. She's hot. She's the hottest. Is she not the hottest? Charlie, will you get out...? This is what you do. Let me go in for you. Let me get the blowjob. Come on. Let me see that woman. You're playful now? Come on. Get out. Stop it! Get out of here! Did you smell that? She even smells good! Jesus. I wanna know what the hell is going on. No, no. Nothing is going on. No, no. No. Don't tell me nothing's going on. No, no, no. Calm down. Calm down. Let me explain it, okay? Ahem. All right, explain it. She's like out of a 1940s movie. Did you see that girl? I mean, that was just perfection. You okay? "Okay"? No, I wouldn't... I wouldn't use that word. Well, thank you for seeing me. Did I have a choice, Miss Remar? I mean... You've really put me in a terrible position here at my office. Can we just cut to it? I don't wanna take a lot of your time. Yeah. This letter... ...that you sent my... I can do this quick. Wait a... No, no. Please. Recently, I've come through a rotten divorce. I was married for 10 years. My husband was having an affair for five of them. They had another life here in the city. He had two lives. I was walking down the street one day and I saw them. And I followed them, and it was truly like a dream. I spoke to a neighbour and she talked about them as if they were the Joneses living next door all these years. And in that moment, I lost my equilibrium. And I fell, right there on the sidewalk. And... And the thing is, Dr. Johnson, I haven't yet gotten up. Now, my behaviour towards you is inexcusable, I know that. I behaved in a way I don't normally behave. What I've done by even threatening a lawsuit is so repulsive to me. Oh, I even lied to you when I told you that my therapist had told me to act on my thoughts. I wanted to come in and see you and tell you that I am so sorry. And that I am very embarrassed. And that you won't be having any more trouble from me. I promise that to you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I'll go now. Yeah. I'll leave. Hey, come on back. Elizabeth, can I get a cup of coffee? Sure. Dr. Johnson, do you want anything? No, he's fine. Me? Get him to talk? No way. That's not what I do. Well, he needs to talk to somebody. He's in trouble. He needs to... To see somebody. He's got you. He's got a friend. That's big. That's a major step. No, he needs more help than I can give him. So, what are you gonna do, are you gonna save him now? Is that what this is all about? I was his best friend. His golfing and his fishing buddy, okay? Our families vacationed together. Okay. On September 12th, 2001, that was over. He wants nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with my wife. He likes you, Alan. You know why? Why? It's very simple. Because you know nothing about Doreen and Jenny and Julie and Gina. Or Spider, the family poodle. You know nothing about them, so he figures you won't ask any questions. He figures you'll just let him be. Now, how funny is this? That you're up here wanting me to help out in yet another fruitless campaign to get Charlie to see a shrink. The one guy he figures would just let him be. Hey. Hey. I think I'm gonna get him some help. Charlie. Did he ask you for help? Well, he needs help. He's gotta get back in the game. He's gotta get his life back, you know. The people around him right now, they're just enabling him. Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, what do the experts say? Uh... I don't know. I'll find out. I know he needs help. And you think you have time for all this? I mean, with work and your mom and... Oh, I... I... I know you don't think so, but I... I'm trying to help him. Heh. Trying to help my friend. Okay. Want some breakfast? Yeah. Thank you. Just glad you wanted to do this just out of nowhere. Well, you know, I think it's about time you get your head around what is and what isn't good music. Oh, right, right, right. Oh, Graham Nash. Songs For Beginners. Just... Just the album cover alone. Look at that face. He knows he made a great record. Oh, okay, wait. Right here. Okay. We got O'Jays. We got, uh... What else we got? The Soul Tr... Hey. From the Funk Side. Now, what record collection's complete without this? I'll put that on my list. Hey, Alan. Oh, hey, Nigel. Hey. How are you? Good. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm, uh, I'm just sort of rummaging. I'm, uh... I'm, uh... Ahem. I'm a vinyl hound. I love this stuff. Yeah. Hey, Charlie, this is, uh, a good friend of mine, Nigel. Nigel, Charlie Fineman. Charlie Fineman, Nigel. Billy Joel, Cold Spring Harbor. They recorded this at too high of a speed, so it was unreleasable. Eventually it came out, though. He actually grew up two towns away from where I grew up. We used to go to the same White Castle. Huh. Say, do you guys wanna get some lunch after this? Yeah. What do you think, Charlie? I just wanna stay here. Well... Well, afterwards. I just thought, you know, let's go get some lunch with Nigel. Can I talk to you? I don't wanna eat with that guy. He's a dork. I mean, look at him, he's a giant dork. Heh. Looks like a lump of shit that someone left on the sidewalk. Charlie, come on. Admit it. He's a dork. Tell me he's not a dork. Charlie, I'm pretty sure he can hear you. So, what do you do, Charlie? I'm a collector. Really? What do you collect? What do I collect? I don't know. Johnson, you can answer for me. What do I collect? Uh... Charlie collects things from his life. You know, things that, uh... That he finds germane to his lifestyle. And, um, how would you describe your lifestyle, Charlie? I noticed in the record store, you were holding up a Bob Seger album. Are you a Seger man, Nigel? Love Seger, yes. Yeah. Smokin' O.P. 's, Mongrel. When'd you get into him? Probably later. Silver Bullet or Seger System? Well, actually, I... I don't like either of those albums. That's funny, because they're not albums. Those are his bands. Seger's an artist. A genius. An American original. And what are you, Nigel? A therapist? Is that it? You sizing me up? You on the case now? You gonna fix me? No, look, I... I... I was out for a... A nice afternoon, I ran into my old friend... Oh, bullshit. You stink like a shrink. You got shrink hands. You ordered your salad like a shrink. - Okay. Let's stop. This was my mistake. No, no, no. No, this is good. Now, now... And, uh... How does a shrink order a salad? Don't, Nigel. In your opinion. I'd like to know. Let's go outside. Right now. I'm gonna beat your ass. I will beat your ass, shrink-wrap. Seger fan. You'd get your ass kicked at a fucking Seger concert. Charlie. Get the fuck up! Get up! I made you in the record store the minute I saw your dorky face. Outside! Okay, Charlie, calm down. You liar. Hey. Hey. The girls still at gymnastics? Yep. I'm gonna go wash up. I made dinner. Where were you, at Charlie's? You know what the whole problem is? This whole Charlie problem? You're jealous of him. Really? Yeah, really. See, I have a friend now, and I'm spending time away from the house, and it's got your feathers ruffled. You are jealous of Charlie. I actually think you're jealous of Charlie. He's caught up in this world of pain, thick like quicksand, and your only response is to covet his freedom. That is sick, Janeane. Is it? What, I'm jealous of that? Do... Just because the guy can, what, do whatever he wants now, and he... he's got the freedom to just... I mean, you think I'm jealous of that? I covet that? You need to check yourself. That is... That's sick. What happened to that woman? The one that wanted to go down on you? I talked to Melanie at the office, and she said you made it go away. Wait a minute. You called Melanie? Yes, I did. So you're checking up on me now, Janeane? Alan, I gotta talk to somebody, because you're not talking to me. Well, she's right. I made it go away. I'd like to know how you did that. I invited the woman in, I shut the door, I hopped on the desk and I just let her do it. That's real mature, Alan. Well, listen to what you're saying to me, Janeane. What are you insinuating? You don't know me better than that? I'm gonna go take a walk. Say hi to Charlie. Don't do that. Don't. You don't... Don't act like you know what I'm... Did I say I was going over to Charlie's? Don't do that. You're not i-in my head. Send him my love. See? You want... Heh. And if I... Then... Okay. Okay. Charlie Fineman to see Dr. Johnson. Did you wanna talk, Charlie? I'll wait. It's private. Oh, well, you can speak freely. I mean, this one's totally knocked out. She's a thousand miles away. And Anna's from Guatemala. She just got to this country recently. She doesn't even speak English. Uh, Anna, Charlie's a superhero from outer space, and he stuffs the front of his tights with a sock. You are very nice. See? Privacy. I was thinking about it, and you were right. I... I do need to get some help. I wanna get help. That's great. Yeah. I... I... I just... I gotta be really careful, though, I don't... I just know I'm better off not having certain thoughts. But... But you're doing the right thing because you need help to process those thoughts. Well, I don't want it to be that bozo Nigel. No. He's a dork. Uh, he's the biggest dork I've ever seen. Uh, yeah, I get it. All right. I... I get it. That was seriously fucked up, Alan. I didn't know he was gonna say all that shit. Angela? Hi. Hey. How you doing? Good, thank you. You? Good. Good to see you. Nice to see you. Yeah. Uh, Charlie, this is Angela. Angela, this is Charlie. He's my college roommate. Nice to meet you, Charlie. Well, thanks for seeing us on such short notice. Why don't you guys come in and make yourselves comfortable? I was just gonna grab a coffee. Anyone? No, I'm good. Charlie? Are you kidding me? She's a baby. Listen, you're right. She's young. But she's... She's good. She's got a lot of experience with loss and grief counselling. Just give her... She's got nice tits. That's not good. Since when? Good point. Listen. Look. We'll do the meet-and-greet, you'll see what you think, and if you like her, we'll just... We go from there. Am I wrong about her tits, though? No, you're right. They're wonderful. So, what are you guys talking about? What's so wonderful? Well, think about it, Charlie, and call me or have Alan call me and we'll schedule something. Donna, hi. I'm early. Yeah. Um... Uh, Dr. Johnson. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. I'm early. Okay. Um... Oh, uh, Donna, this is Charlie. You... You remember Donna, right? She's... She's early. Hi. We were just wrapping up. Are you a patient of Angela's? No, no. I didn't agree to that yet. We're just, uh... But you are. And it's because you're her... And you two are... Yes. We should get started. And we have a session now, so... - Let's get going. We should get started. I'm sorry about the overlap. And... Charlie, it was nice to meet you. Alan, thank you. Better bring out the big guns for this one, okay? She's like crazy with a side of crazy. Okay. Okay. Bye-bye. Just saying. Protect yourself. You okay? Yeah. I don't... Just make sure they never schedule me near that girl, all right? That... I would... No, it's just, I never wanna see her again. That's trouble. She's too good-looking, I just... Nobody has a right to look that good. It's just it's trouble for everybody. Okay, Charlie. Ah. So have you thought at all about what you'd like to talk about today? And how you wanna start this? Not really. I don't know. Uh... I'm good. You're good? I'm okay. That's good. And what makes you okay? I don't know. Can I just say something? You're too young. You're a baby. I can't do this. What can I do to help you, Charlie? How can someone like me help you? I have these things... ...that I don't like to think about. You're too young. You're too young. I can't do this. I gotta put these back on. That's okay. What do you like to do for fun, Charlie? I don't know. I like movies. I like comedies. Mel Brooks movies. I like to play the drums. I like to play "Colossus." Go ahead. Is this session over yet? - Do you want it to be? - Yeah. Then it's over. Thank you. - How'd it go? - It went good. She helped a lot. I think I'm all better. Charlie. Hey. So, Charlie... I wanted to go back to where we were last week. You were telling me that there's some things... that you don't like to think about. Do you think you could give me an example of some of those things? Not yet. I'm not ready for that. Okay. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about today? You're too young. I told you that. It's just... You're too young to do this. I'm gonna put these back on. Okay. I can hear you still. May I say something? You've obviously put a lot of effort into not thinking about these things. No, no, no. I don't remember them, all right? I don't like to remember. But you said that you wanted help, right? I mean, you said that you were ready to talk about some of these things. And part of the help that I can give you... is to help you be okay with thinking about some of those things. You wanna know what I think about? - You wanna know? - Yes, yes. Your tits. - Okay. - They're round and they're perfect... and I think about them for that reason. - That's what's on my mind. - Thank you, Charlie. Thank you. Is the session over yet? - If you want it to be. - I do. Then it's over. So how are you, Charlie? How was your week? Mm. It was good. Except I was angry. I was pretty mad. Who were you mad at? I was mad at you. I didn't really wanna come back here. Why didn't you wanna come back? Well, you know why. Every week, you try to make me do it again. What do I try to make you do, Charlie? Talk about things I don't wanna talk about. Well, for the last few weeks, you've been saying you were getting ready to talk about some of those... No, goddamn it, that was you! I didn't say that, you did! I don't wanna talk about those things. I don't remember. I'm sorry. I'm glad you came in, even though you were mad at me. Yeah. I am too. Can I say something, Charlie? Yeah. It might make you mad again. No. Go. There is no point in you coming here every week, if we eventually don't discuss your life and discuss your family. Is this session over yet? No, it just started. Can it be? If you want it to be, yes. Charlie, bef... before you go, I'd just... I'd like to say something. Um... Look, the fact is you had a family, and you suffered a great loss, and until you can discuss that and we can really talk about that, This is all just an exercise. I can be patient, Charlie, but you need to tell someone your story. It doesn't have to be me, but someone. Hey, Charlie, wait a second. You didn't tell me that this guy's partner was black. I mean, that... That makes this almost bearable. Why... Why do they gotta give him the green V plunge...? I mean, that's... Why'd they do that? That's kind of faggoty. I had three daughters. I know. Gina was 5. She was... Jenny... ...was 7. She, uh... She liked boys already. Julie was 9. She was... She was older. They all looked alike, Johnson. Like Doreen. Doreen was my wife. D.T. That was her nickname. Doreen Timpleman. She had a dog, Spider. Spider. A poodle. They'd wake me up all the time, Saturday mornings, you know, singing Beatles songs to me, in harmony. The four of them. So cute. So cute. Doreen never, never judged me. You know? Never nagged, like... Like some wives do. She just wanted me to take my shoes off, so I didn't wreck the carpet. That's it. Doreen and the girls were very female. I... I... I was the oddball, you know? Mr. Man. They adored me, Johnson. I bet they did. I know they did, Charlie. They had long brown hair, except little Gina. She kept her hair short, you know. To be different from everybody. She, uh... She had a birthmark too. Looked like a burn, but it wasn't. When she was little, they said it was gonna go away, but it never did. Jenny. Jenny, this one, she wanted to be a gymnast. She was such a klutz, though. I didn't have the heart to mention it as a problem. They, uh, went to see Doreen's sister, Ellen, and her girls in Boston and they took Spider because... ...I had to work and they didn't trust me to feed her. But that was a joke, right? And then, uh... ...we were all going to D.T.'s little cousin's wedding in Los Angeles, and I was gonna meet them out there. The kids wanted to go to, uh, Disneyland, but they had, uh... They were already gonna miss a couple days of school, so we had to say no. You know. So I'm going on out to, uh, meet them in Los Angeles. And on my way to JFK, I'm in the taxicab, and I hear on the radio... I get there and some man tells me the plane's from Boston. Some other guy says there's two planes. Then I go inside the airport and I'm watching... I'm watching on the television and I... And I... I... I saw it. I saw it and I felt it at the same time. I thought about Gina's birthmark, and I... I felt them burning. Can we go? I wanna go home now. I don't like this. I don't like doing it. Remembering. I don't like remembering. New York One has learned there's evidence of a credible terror threat, and New York City may be a target. As a result, the terror-alert status has been raised. City officials are beefing up security on our subways, buses and airports. Specifics about the threat haven't been released. Cops will not confirm whether there's a link to the al Qaeda terror group... which has... For Americans and Iraqis alik e, today's violent demonstrations Were just another long chapter in the ongoing war on terror. In Baghdad, a cop... Charlie? Charlie, are you here? Charlie. Lincoln next door called to say that you were listening to the TV too loud. I said you didn't listen to the TV, but... Are you okay? Charlie. Charlie. What's wrong with you? What are you doing, man? You fucking almost hit me. What are you, drunk? Are you drunk? You almost hit me. Get out of the way before I fucking run you over. You run me over? Come on. Come run me over. Whoa! Run me over! - Look out! Get out of the way! Okay, friend, drop the gun! N.Y.P. D! Drop the gun now! N.Y.P. D! Drop the gun! Andrew, where are you, man? This guy's crazy! It's good. Andrew! Just do it. Come on, do it. Andrew, where are you? Do it. I'm gonna toast him, Andrew! Do it. Get him the fuck down! Do not move a muscle. Don't ever point a gun at me again. I should've fucking shot you. Get up. Get up. Get up on your feet now! Against the wall. Up against the wall. Get the fuck up, you bastard! What the fuck you think this is? Stay the fuck up! Get the fuck up! Alan, say hi to Pete Savarino, he's Charlie's attorney. This is Alan Johnson. How are you? It looks like all the criminal charges are gonna be dropped. Well, that's good. Yeah. The, uh, city doesn't wanna make a big case out of this. A 9/11 widower gets beat up by the cops. Doesn't look good. So we're gonna go a different way. They wanna do a three-day psych evaluation at Roosevelt Hospital. That's standard procedure. Well, it's better than jail, I guess, but Jesus... Here you go. Here, talk to him and I'll get the paperwork done. Okay. You okay? What's gonna happen? Well, um, they wanna hold on to you for a few days and do a psych evaluation, you know. Oh. Angela and I, we're gonna... We're gonna follow you and... Okay. I'll get you settled in, make sure everything's all right. I'm really sorry, Charlie. I feel like this is my fault. You know, like I pushed you too hard. I just wanted you to... ...be better or something, I don't know. Some... I'm sorry. When you feel uncomfortable, you let me know, all right? Are you calm? I'm good. But something that you are not doing has brought him here to this point. That's completely irrelevant. I will see to it that he has proper out-post treatment, and I will take care of him. Please don't tell me how to do my job. I understand what is needed here. - I... I... I'm not wanting him to... Sign out. Where's he going? - I don't know. Listen, Charlie, there's gonna be a... A hearing Friday morning. The DA's office wants you back in here. They wanna have you committed. They wanna have the right to hold on to you for up to a... A year. That's what they're saying. The hospital staff is recommending it as well and the... The Timplemans, they're... They're onboard with it too. The Timplemans? Can we go get Chinese now? You know what it is? Janeane and I are just up under each other too much. She's always asking me to open up, you know, talk to her, and... and... And then I do, and everything gets so personal, and the whole thing just goes to shit. Yeah. Yeah? She says she wants to hear what I have to say. She doesn't wanna hear what I have to say. Well, what do you have to say? That I need some air. You know? I mean, I love her. I lo... I... I'm still in love with her. But, come on, give me some air, man. I mean, it's like I'm not even me anymore. You know? I'm not some damn Siamese twin, I'm me. And that shouldn't piss her off. It's just... It shouldn't. You wanna know what I remember about you from college? Nobody ever gave you any shit. You didn't take shit from anybody. And you know what else? I hate what I do. You know, the money's good. But I swear to God, I hate putting phoney teeth on phoney people. But don't get me wrong. I'm a dentist, and when people need it, that's great. I mean I feel for them. But some of these assholes, I just wanna slap them in the back of the head and say: "Get your ass out on the street." You know? "There's a lot worse things to worry about than your teeth." So, what's going on with this, uh, kitchen-remodelling thing? What's... What's up with that? What else could you do besides veneers? N-no, no. Don't change the subject. What's... What's going on with that? Come on, tell me. What's up with the kitchen thing? Tell me. The last time I spoke to Doreen... ...she was at the airport in Boston. She wanted... Wanted to talk to me... ...about the kitchen remodel that she and the... And the girls wanted to do. And I was busy, running out the door... ...and I... I fucking snapped at her. I fu... Oh, man, the last time I fucking spoke to her. I hated kitchen talk. I think you gotta let that go, Charlie. I'm sure you said a lot of nice shit to her before then, man. It's one thing, man. Just let it go. Yeah? Hell, yeah. I... Are you gonna be all right, Charlie? You're gonna make it, right? I... I'm more worried about you, Johnson. I'm more worried about you. If you listen carefully, you... You'll be able to hear assholes puckering, okay? Go, go, go. Hello. Listen up. If I ever happen to get into a situation with a patient again, I don't care what it does to our liability, you know what you're gonna do? You're gonna back me up. I put this practise together, and I made you all filthy stinking rich. Especially you, Stelter. Now you got a problem with what I'm saying, you could take your ass right back to Brooklyn and get whacked around with insurance cases for all I care. That's it. I'm sick of playing with you candy-asses. You know, Alan, I really think this is inappropriate. Oh. Oh. I don't care what you think. This isn't a discussion. It's a warning. There's gonna be some changes made around here, and you may not all make the cut. Oh. As you were. The new champ, you... No, no. You were in there with me. It's what you said in the restaurant. Oh. See, that's the old college Johnson. Yeah. That's taking-no-shit Johnson. I gotta... Unfortunately, I, um... I think I was thinking about another guy we know. Handleman, Andrew Handleman. He didn't take shit from nobody. Oh, yeah. You used to take shit from everybody, though. Remember that? But you were great in this one. That was fun. What were the combined findings of the hospital staff? Ahem. The staff did find Charles Fineman victim to severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as delusional tendencies related to that and an incapability to function in anything resembling a normal adult manner. And do you think remanding him to the hospital for up to a year would benefit Dr. Fineman? Yes, I do. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Bale. You may step down. I disagree strongly with that finding. Your Honour, I think that Charlie needs to find his own way. Not on our time, but on Charlie's time. And I think that will happen. He'll find people that will fill his life again. Not today, but soon. Slowly. Can I just ask a question about your life experience in regard to this long-term illness? I'm curious. How old are you? Wait... W-What does that have to do with anything? Dr. Fineman... That question sucks, Your Honour. It's actually a good question. No, no, no, it sucks. It sucks. You know, we're... We're gonna talk about age. He's gotta go to Little League practise soon. Dr. Fineman. Mr. Fallon, the question's specious. It demeans the court. You don't need to address it, Dr. Oakhurst. He... He wouldn't talk about them from that day on, any of them. Then he cut us off. He wouldn't take my calls. He... He wouldn't take our calls. You know, this... This has destroyed my wife a second time, what's happening here with Charlie, uh... She couldn't even take the stand today. This has been awfully hard on her. Tell me about what happened the last time Charlie was over. We wanted to show him some pictures of the girls, some photos. It was very, very hard. We wanted to give them to him. And what happened when you showed him the photos? Charlie broke a beautiful lamp of Ginger's. It was one of a set. We gave the other to our daughter. It was... How long are we gonna talk about this lamp? Goddamn it. It was a lamp. Let it go already. It's more than a lamp, Charlie. Yeah. Oh, come on. It was a hell of a lot more than a lamp. Just stop it already. Just stop it. Okay, okay. Enough. That's one. Both of you, that's one. Mrs. Timpleman, sit down. He knows damn well what that fricking lamp meant to me. Sit down. Go on. Do you carry any pictures of your grandchildren, Jonathan? Uh... In my wallet, yes, of course I do. Of course he does. What is he, an animal? Oh, ma'am, please stop. Are these photographs copies of the same photographs that you carry with you every day? Yes. And what was this little angel's name? This is Gina. She was 5. She was a little doll. And this is little Jenny. Heh. She was quite a little chess player. She got that from me. Jenny wanted to join a tournament, so I signed her up and we went. Charlie. - And that photograph, that's you and her at a chess tournament together? Yes. Go on. And this? This is all of us at the Cape. And this photograph. This is your daughter Doreen here? Yes. And this photograph, this is all four of them? Yes. All four of them. Dr. Fineman. Shh-shh. Dr. Fineman. That's two. I bet you miss them. I think about them all day. Every day of my life. I don't understand how anyone could not. Dr. Fineman. I have no further questions, Your Honour. Your Honour, you gonna allow this? That's three. Bailiff. Take him out to the hallway. Just let the guy... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hey, come on. Hey, take it easy. Take it easy with him. I'm right here, Charlie. Charlie, I'm right here. Charlie, I'm right here. Clear the court. I wanna see counsel for both sides and the Timplemans in my chambers in 20 minutes. This is a mess. First off, you ever pull crap like that in my court again, I will have hardened inmates using you as a dress-up doll. You hear me? Your Honour, in my defence... Quiet. You know something? The more I think about this damn case, the more I realise that this is a family matter. This... This is not something that the state should be deciding upon. Your Honour... Shut up. I'm serious. I want you to shut up, Mr. Fallon. This is not going well for you, you hear me? Shut up. Yes. Shut up. Mr. And Mrs. Timpleman... ...this is very serious stuff we're talking about here. I mean, it's easy to see that this man is going through something very profound. It's obvious. He may need some hospitalization. He may. On the other hand, he might just need to find his own way. The fact is, you're correct. You are the closest thing he has to family. Thank you. Yes, of course. I want you to go home and think very hard this weekend. Because we're all gonna meet back here on Monday morning, and I'm going to let the two of you decide. I want you to rack your brains. I want you to think about what your little girl would have you do in this situation. And I'm gonna have you look me straight in the eye on Monday morning and tell me whether or not she would want her man put away in a place like that. You understand what it is that I am telling you, Mrs. Timpleman? The power that I am putting in your hands. Yes. Yes, sir. Your Honour, can I just say something? Let me... What is his name? Uh... B-Bryan Sugarman. Bryan Sugarman. Monday morning. Ten-thirty. Don't bring Sugarman. Is Dr. Johnson coming out? He's inside with the judge. Can I sit down? Charlie, can Donna sit down? She really wanted to come to your hearing today to support you. Here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On your side. She can sit on your side, though. All right? I don't know how they can't see that he's just got a broken heart. It's so broken, his poor heart. It's okay. I don't need to talk about her or look at pictures because the... The truth is, a lot of times, I see her, on the street. I walk down the street, I see her in someone else's face, clearer than any of the pictures you carry with you. I get that you're in pain. But you got each other. You got each other, and I'm the one w-who's gotta see her and the girls all the time. Everywhere I go. I even see the dog. That's how fucked up I still am. I look at a German shepherd, I see our goddamn poodle! All right. Aw. All right. What is this? He's gone. The movers finished up an hour ago. Didn't even leave a forwarding. Wha...? He just left this. He said that this was to be for you, Ginger. Oh. Listen, I know you've both been through hell, but shouldn't you just leave him alone? We just wanna be part of his life. No, I know. I understand, but it's... It's not an option right now. Monday morning, you need to go in there, and just call off the dogs. Okay. You take care, Adell. Thank you for taking care of Charlie. Thanks. When did he redo the kitchen? Oh, God, the kitchen. Sixteen thousand times he did the kitchen. It's beautiful. The girls would love the colour. They would love this look. It's a kitchen, sweetie. Come on. Can you sign off for me? Hey. Thanks. This is the last of it, okay. I got a pizza coming. Could you just send it up for me? Yeah, yeah, we'll send it up. You're up. Huh? Wanna go? No, no, no. I gotta... ...get back to your spot and get my car. I'll come and hang out with you tomorrow for lunch. Hi. Hi. Come on in. Anyone order pizza? This is the place. Here, I'll take it. Come on in. Come on in. I'm gonna go. Yeah, I think it's okay. Hi. Hey. Hey, Charlie, um, you don't mind if Donna stays and has some pizza, right? Oh, yeah, she can stay. There's some plates in the kitchen. Thank you, Dr. Johnson. For everything. Okay. I'm gonna take off, and I'll, uh... I'll catch you tomorrow, all right, buddy? Okay. All right. Go head. You're up. I'm up? I told you, I gotta go... Go? You said you wanted to go again. I thought you said that. Don't you wanna go? You said you wanted to take another shot and stick around, remember? Yep, that's what I said. "Shadows of the Colossus." Hey. Hey. Where are you? Did you pick the girls up yet? Going right now. What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? Cooking dinner. Janeane, I gotta tell you something, babe, um... I don't know how I got to the place where I'm... Where I'm not letting you in, but you're right, I'm not and... That's wrong. I gotta open up to you. Because I don't wanna be that guy, baby. I... I don't wanna be that guy. I don't know if anything I said even makes any sense, but... Alan, just come home. I love you. I know I probably don't tell you that enough, but I do. I love you. Can you just pick the girls up and come home? I love you too. I'll be home in a minute, okay? You guys left this. Don't leave stuff laying around. I mean it. Hey. No, no, no, Kemp. Take this back upstairs. Kemp.
