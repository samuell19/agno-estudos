However, these materials showed significant differences in the shots and editing sequences used, which suggests that there were at least two different negatives at the time For the reconstruction, it was necessary to identify alternative shots and to sort the better shots and colorings in the film positive material according to plot logic In the process, age-related color changes in the lighting were compensated ROBERT REINERT'S MONUMENTAL FILM-WORK OPIUM Professor Gesellius Eduard Von Winterstein Maria, his wife - Hanna Ralph Nung-Chiang - Werner Krauss Sin, later Magdalena - Sybill Morel Dr. Armstrong - Friedrich Kuhne Dr. Richard Armstrong, his son Conrad Veidt Ali - Alexander Delbosq The opium girl - Sigrid Hohenfels Writer and director: Robert Reinert Cameraman: Helmar Lerski OPIUM - 1st ACT Opium, strangest of all poisons, benefactor of sufferers of illness and pain both benevolent and terrible!
