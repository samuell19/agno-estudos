Good morning. Hiroshi, look. He still carries his scetchbook. He seems so normal since he has lost his wife. It's a month ago now that his wife left him. I wonder where he's going with the torch. Wait, Hiroshi! This is my secret place. All my lost treasures are here. All the beautiful things I have ever lost, they are here. All the time I have lost is here. Everything is hidden in the darkness. When I was a child, there used to be a river here. I played there. Fish, friends, dragonflies... They disappeared. Chibi, is that you? You were away out of a sudden! And now you are here in this cold place. You poor thing. I am a painter. I have to paint Chibi. You? I met you once. Then, when there was a river here. It was you then? Yes, I am the mermaid. When the river got dried this is where I stranded. I can hear you. Your voice sounds in my heart. You have been living here in the dark... all this time. Ever since the day I met you here I enjoy coming here. I came here for years in order to paint. Now I understand the reason. Why? Just to see you again and to paint. Everything, I have ever lost, I can find in you. From now on I will paint you all the time. What is it? You get something in such places. We go home. To my place. We have to look after the infection. Let's go home. Thanks. Let me see. This will certainly help you. This medicine heals all kinds of diseases. You better paint me. That is your mission. Yes, my mission. That's true. Das ist wahr. I am a painter. I will paint you. From now on I will paint you forever. Hiroshi, what happened to the painter from upstairs? He used to go out everyday with his scetchbook. How should I know about it? - Haven't I told you that they delivered a bathtube last week? Why are you so interested in this guy? Stop it. Then stop it. You are so stupid! What is it? Are you ok? Wait. Wait. Thank goodness. It stopped. Thank goodness. Thanks. This medicine doesn't seem to work. Damn it. You should eat something. What do you want? It's long ago that I had fish. Fish. I'll get you some fresh fish. Wait here. Hello. Is it true? - Yes, it's true. I was shocked. I see half bitten raw fish in the trash every day. You can judge people according to their trash. It is very strange. I'm sick of it. Yes, it is strange. A whole fish in one bite. Maybe he bought a little pet monster. Hiroshi, you frighten me! Are you sure you want it? Yes, there are little pupps of seven Different colours in these tumours. My body is full of little pupps of seven colours. I suffer so much. Please hurry. My body hurts! I suffer. Hurry up! Do it. I am tired. I need a break. I go out to get some fish. What? Are you ok? Don't dy. Don't dy! She died. My mermaid is dead. She died. My precious mermaid died. She died. She died. Quick, you have to paint me. You have to paint me in the moment before I die. Hurry up! The painting. It's finished. Now I have to look after you. No, it's too late. You have to kill me now. It's a long time ago that I've seen the painter from upstairs. I wonder what has happened. - I smell rotten fish. It's so strange. It makes me sick. Do you think something is wrong? What? What's that? Hiroshi... Mr Haydashi? It's open. She's dead. My mermaid is dead. She is dead. My mermaid is dead. She is dead. So... What can I say? The dead body must belong to his wife. It's a terrible story. She was awfully injured. You know, there was a baby in there. When I think about it... Are you ok? I'm scared! He killed his wife. Let us pass. His wife had been bedridden for a long time. He was an art teacher. A very gentle, friendly man. What will happen to him? I have no idea. Beautiful... Beautiful... This is the result of the investigation. According to the autopsy report the painter dismembered his wife. She was pregnant, in her eight month and was in the last state of stomach cancer. The foetus died in the mother. The painter insisted on having killed a mermaid. According to the psychological test he is schizophrenic and got hospitalized. This is the result of the investigation. A scale was found in his bathtube. The Japanese Fishery Laboratory couldn't find out what kind of fish it is from.
