Lake Toya, Hokkaido G8 Summit Venue We've got enough here, Sanpei. Let's go look around. Sure. Wow... What an amazing view!. It's the perfect place for a summit on man's coexistence with nature. But is there any point to it? It's the 33rd one they've had. Yeah. The world's just going from bad to worse. It's still better than doing nothing, isn't it? You're in the way. We came all the way here. One shot of me won't hurt. You're so mean. What's that? Hm? That sound. Don't you hear it? That's strange. I could swear the sound came from around here. Nobody would live this far out. Sumire, didn't we already pass by here? I can't remember if we did or not. I'm sure we did. I don't think so. It's too risky. I don't want to get lost out here. Let's go back. Wait. It's this way. Sumire! Wait, Sumire, let's not go any farther in! Sumire! DoWn in tHe lake, deep in tHe Woods, birds cry out, stars sHine doWn.

G8 Summit - Lake Toya, Hokkaido WHile tHe Kyoto Protocol Was draWn up Here in tHis very country Japan Hasn 't reduced its carbon dioxide emission, but ratHer increased it by 8%%. THis is no Way to set an example for tHe nations of tHe World. I'd like to Hear Prime Minister Ibe 's outlook on WHat Will be done. What do you plan to do? Prime Minister lbe, what are your thoughts? Well, in that regard, er...we're doing our best, in a constructive manner... Through environmental taxes, development of eco-friendly technology... Although, we're hindered by numerous problems... Excuse me. I must visit the restroom. Our country is noW Warmer, and We enjoy tHe nicer WeatHer. We ratHer Welcome tHis global Warming. HoW can you say tHat? If global Warming continues, do you Have any idea WHat'll Happen to our EartH? SHe 's rigHt. Pizza is tHe only tHing tHat needs to be Warm. WHat's so funny? HoW dare you! City of Sapporo I u nderstand what you're saying, but when I speak about my beautiful country, Japan... What? There's a monster in Sapporo? Monster X Strikes Back Attack tHe G8 Summit! Cast Natsuki Kato Kazuki Kato Hide Fukumoto, Akira MatsusHita Matabe Watabe, (THe NeWspaper) Bin Furuya Susumu Kurobe Yosuke Natsuki Beat TakesHi Directed by Minoru KaWasaki Mamma mia! I'm Director-General Narumi of Japan's Defense Forces. It seems this monster landed here from outer space. We're checking into it further, but as it can fly, this venue itself is in danger. Sir, we beg you to tell all the heads of state to return home immediately. Everyone, due to the current emergency, I wish to suspend the summit. We will escort you home safely. Please don't worry. This way, quickly... Hurry, please. This way. Mr. President, what would your nation do if something happens to you? THat's tHe last tHing tHey Want to see. I'll stay...to get it on WitH tHat monster. I'm staying too. Angelika, WHy do you stand alongside tHe US President? If I go back to Germany noW, tHe male members of parliament Would laugH and say tHat I'm scared of tHe monster because I am a Woman. I do tHis not just for me but for tHe Women of tHe World. So I sHall stay and figHt. I'll stay too. THe Wisdom of Ancient Rome may prove useful. I don 't get it. WHy are you alWays so Quick to exclude Russia? Russia remains as Well. HoWever, not because tHe US told us to. Just nortH of Hokkaido, tHe Russian motHerland begins. SakHalin and tHe Kuril Islands are ours. As Supreme Commander of Russian Forces, I sHall remain Here. I appreciate your support, but those islands belong to Japan. Give it up, already. Sure... G8 Summit - Lake Toya, Hokkaido G8 Space Monster Task Force HQ Although we haven't identified the monster, we think it emerged from a meteorite which fell from outer space. Where in outer space? Please wait while we investigate the details. Let me read the G8's recently-approved joint statement. The era of Earth's nations fighting each other is over. "Henceforth, we cooperate to rid the world of this monster's threat." This agreement is signed by Russia, the US, Germany, Canada, ltaly, Japan, France, and the UK, thus confirming the G8's resolve. That is all! Wait a moment! Wait a moment! Are there any concrete measures? I'll update you soon. Which planet is it from? Details are unclear, but the G8 will spearhead the resistance. They haven't identified it, but it's from a meteorite, apparently. Understood. Cancel Summit articles. Only monster specials from now on. It's currently flying toward the Pacific. A "scoop"? Exactly. We're a tabloid. We can't just print monster stuff like everyone else. We've done UFOs and ghosts, and now we've got a real monster! Go grab that perfect scoop, got it? But press restrictions are so tight we'll just get the same as the others. Nonsense! Remember, we're the T okyo Sports Daily! Quit moping around. Get out there! Whatever angle you want... I leave it up to you. Do whatever you have to to get an exclusive scoop! I'll do my best, sir. I'm counting on you. Go for it! Ready to go? Yeah, let's go! Special neWs report Giant monster appears in Sapporo What's up? It's like I've seen it before... Where? Forget it. The monster is now flying southeast over Hokkaido. A this rate, it'll reach the Pacific by this evening. I'd be happy if it leaves Japan. If We strike WHile it's over tHe Pacific, We'll limit collateral damage. Yes, sir. Hey. You keep saying "monster' but let's give it a name. I like the sound of "Guilala." He's like a Gila monster I saw in a zoo. No way! And civilians aren't allowed in here. Hey. Sir! What're you doing in here? Come with us. Let me go! Excuse me, sir! According to recent intelligence, the object thought to have produced Guilala wasn't a meteorite, but China's Mars probe "AAC-Beta." Germans don't like tHings 'Made in CHina ' eitHer. Dr. Sano of the Space Creature Research Center is analyzing the debris. Dr. Sano? Sano, here. What have you found so far? I'm clarifying the details, but it appears a cosmic spore seeking an energy source adhered to the nozzle of the Mars probe. When it crashed in Sapporo, the resulting explosion allowed the spore to absorb vast amounts of hi-temp energy. Then gravitational differences on Earth, among other factors, brought about the transformation we witnessed. We hope to have China recognize the damage Guilala caused to Japan and to claim compensation from them in due course. THey Won't pay you in a million years. Dr. Sano... Do you tHink tHe monster, presently airborne over Hokkaido, Will keep moving toWard tHe Pacific and leave Japan? Unfortunately, I do not. The Pacific doesn't contain the hi-temp energy it wants. So it's not likely to leave Hokkaido? I can't say conclusively, but the chance it will remain is extremely high. Excuse me, sir! The monster is approaching Noboribetsu power plant! What? One moment, Mr. President. We Japanese are devising a plan to stop Guilala based on Dr. Sano's analysis. Allow us more time. Damn, there's a roadblock. Can't we go any farther? Guilala is up ahead, so we can't let you pass. We reporters have a duty to inform the people. Please contact the PR section at Military HQ. Then every article will be the same. In a crisis, false reports might give rise to mass panic. News of Guilala's movements must be cleared with HQ. That's manipulation of the media. Press freedom guards the people's right to know. Are you trying to reinstate militarism? Sumire. It's okay. Let's go back. It's not okay! Why leave? It's no use arguing with the rank and file. Then how do we get a scoop? It's frustrating, I know. But let's find another way. Like what? Let's try and think. Let's find a new angle the military hasn't figured out. If that's even possible... So here we have Guilala, right? It's my childhood dream come true. Although I wish it had been Varan or Baragon. Better if they'd appeared all at once, really... Many in Sapporo have died, y'know? Well, that's inevitable. It's how these things happen. Lots more will die. That's how monsters show their power. Personally, I wouldn't mind. It's a perfect way to go. Lily Franky, Q: WHat are your tHougHts on tHe Guilala Sapporo attack? Not many tourists are in Sapporo right now. In any case, the environment's ruined, right? Rather than doing nothing and watching it collapse under the logic of capitalism, this monster destruction shows us just how wrong we've been... It actually might make things turn out for the best. Isn't Guilala amazing? It's just going crazy. Nothing we can do, really. How will it all end? Any way you slice it, isn't Guilala just incredible? Here in Noboribetsu, "Guilala hot cakes" are selling like hot cakes. They keep selling out. Here's the store. Excuse me, how's business? I feel bad for the victims, but business is business. It's revitalizing our town. Try some candy. It's our latest product. Get your candy here! Reporting from Noboribetsu... That's terrible. For Japanese people, Guilala is just a way to make money. They better laugh while they can... This piece of news just in. According to the Earth Defense Army's Japan HQ, today sees the deployment of the new Vulture missile against Guilala near Mt. Showa. I repeat... That cake shop will be history. Why at Mt. Showa? Guilala is in Noboribetsu... No idea. But let's hurry and snag the best spot. Noboribetsu PoWer Plant Noboribetsu PoWer Plant Colonel Kimura, explain our strategy. Yes, sir. We stimulate the subterranean magma using a special microwave frequency. As the magma gathers under Mt. Showa, it accumulates the hi-temp energy which will attract Guilala there. After Guilala's absorbed the power plant's energy, there's no doubt it'll fix its attention on Mt. Showa. That's where we'll deploy the Earth Defense Force Japan's latest missile, and at point-blank range, blast it away. I doubt you can manipulate tHe magma tHat simply, tHougH. Don't worry. Japan is a world leader in earthquakes. Our magma research is top-notch. All staff, maintain a frequency of 380. What about this, professor? Make it A3. A3, it is. Good morning. Is Guilala really coming? We'll be in trouble if it doesn't. What's the situation? We've activated most of the magma. Hi-temp energy is really building beneath Mt. Showa. Miyake of 2nd Unit to Captain Soma. What is Guilala's status? No change. He's not leaving the power plant. Understood. Please increase the frequency. That'd be dangerous. The mountain may erupt. Just slightly...to see what happens. I developed this system to suppress earthquakes. You're proposing I do the exact opposite. It's so we can defeat Guilala. Please. To all staff, we're raising the frequency to 600 for one minute only. Understood, sir. Earthquake! Look out! Helmets, everyone! Secure the equipment! Evacuate! Wait! Don't leave us! Throw the switch! Turn it off! Throw the switch! Help! Is the Vulture okay? No problems, sir! It reminds me of Naples. Thank you very much. I heard nothing about an eruption. Yes, sir. I'll find out. 2nd Ground Unit, come in. 1st Unit, Soma here... Guilala noticed. It's looking at Mt. Showa. It's flying! It's airborne! It's heading right for us, sir! Ready the Vulture! Here it comes. Deploy into formation! Yes, sir! Did you get it? It's Guilala! It's here at Mt. Showa! In real life, it's huge and terrifying! Will Japan's strategy stand a chance? It's all going according to plan. Target the Vulture at Guilala. Get a target lock on Guilala. Locking on Guilala, sir. Mr. Prime Minister... The launch button... Please. Feel free, Mr. President. It ate it! This is unbelievable! Guilala just ate the missile! Guilala ate our Vulture... Good question... Excuse me, it's my bowels again... Japan Hasn't seen real combat for over Half a century. Asking Herto defeat Guilala Was far more tHan sHe could Handle. Please everyone, don't lose Heart. THey say, '"WHen tHe cat's aWay, tHe mice Will play. '" What does that mean? It's like when we say "Wash when the devil's away." Let's devise our next strategy. I Happen to Have a good idea. Guilala is still absorbing magma energy from Mt. Showa. Under the eyes of the world, Japanese forces bet everything, but failed utterly. We'll wait and see what strategy the G8 comes up with next. Here's the memory card. Deadline's soon. Thanks. I'll go write my report. Hey, wait! You know something about Guilala, don't you? Humans can't beat Guilala. What do you mean? Wait a minute! Hello? Boss, I'm busy. I'll call back! WHat do you tHink, everyone? It's Wonderful, President Pietro. Commander Narumi, mobilize all your forces and Have tHem prepare at once. I understand, but are you quite sure? THe decision is final. THe G8 Guilala Task Force is resolute. Understood. You failed once. THe initiative is no longeryours. We'll execute the plan with all our might. G8 Space Monster Task Force HQ Spirit of Rome - Strategic HQ Be thorough about it. Roger. All units stand by in position. Section A, construction completed. How about Second Unit? Section B, construction completed. Good. Commander! The president insisted on observing from the front lines. Major Takamine, update our new commander-in-chief. Yes, sir. Every facet of the Spirit of Rome Strategy is now ready. Thank you, thank you. Students of lmperial Roman history know that brilliant victory awaits when the commander is on the front line. I stiffen with pride at the superb morale of your men. I stand to fight alongside you. Our only enemy is Guilala. The Spirit of Rome will be your doom! Victory is ours! Commence attack! Guilala is in my sigHts. Launch heat-seeking missile. Fire! Heat-seeking missile aWay. Guilala's following the missile as planned! The missile will lead it to where it'll fall into a hole that was dug! Just a little fartHer! Just a little fartHer! Go! Go! It fell in! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! We did it! We got Guilala! We finally got Guilala! It's a success! Did you get it? Perfectly. We did it! Please interpret this. Let's toast our success with fine ltalian wine. Look at that! It's Guilala! It's still alive! Guilala's climbing out! Move out! It's looking this way! It's easy to just stand tHere and talk. You insensitive, bone-Headed Yank! Mr. Burger, stop this! We're fighting Guilala here! Guilala... Hey. Long time no see, Mr. President. My young successor lbe is under the weather, so I'm taking the reins again. I'm sure if we put our eight heads together, we can finally get rid of Guilala. It's so delicious! It's tHe best I've ever Had! I WisH I'd brougHt my family! Nonsense. Japan Has Wonderful cuisine. THis place Has good food, but tHere must also be many otHers. You're rigHt, of course. WHat Was tHat about? I ate too Quickly... It got stuck in my tHroat. You are so beautiful, Nami. A mysterious jeWel of tHe Orient. You are a smootH talker, Monsieur Sorkozy. But WHat if your neW bride Heard you? Please, Nami, don't... I'd be a disgrace to FrencHmen everyWHere if I didn 't try to Woo you. Really... Nami, my dear Nami... You're my Arc de TriompHe. I'm your Eiffel ToWer. My toWer so Wants to enteryour arcH. WHat about Guilala? Don't botHer it, it Won't botHer us. So, fancy a drink up in my room? Leave us alone. The operation isn't over yet, Monsieur Sorkozy. We'll escort you back. Say WHat! UnHand me! I'll be back, Nami! I promise! I love you! Spirit of Rome - Strategic HQ Polonium 210 Poisoning Plan No need for a large-scale operation. I Hold tHe ultimate poison created by tHe migHt of Russian science. Polonium 210... WitH tHis, We can kill any living creature in a mere matter of seconds. Well, look at it our Way. It's not very Wise for a democratic nation to sHelter a fugitive from a socialist one. It's ratHer out of keeping WitH tHe spirit of international cooperation. Am I rigHt? In my opinion, tHis monster Guilala Will provide empirical proof to everyone of tHe profound nature of Russian justice. Kill it. It worked! It worked! Yes, sir! Mission accomplished. As you can see, Guilala is down! This could finally be a breakthrough! What did they do? I don't know... You see, everyone... It's best to beWare gifts sent from Russia... Contact Dr. Sano for advice about disposing of its body. Yes, sir. Guilala's just sleeping. The Russian poison kills all living things except Guilala. These world leaders are useless! THis is a major advance. Even if Polonium 210 only served to put Guilala to sleep, it's tHe first time We 've Halted it. It's not failure, it's progress. Excuse me, sir! A German transport plane over Okhotsk is requesting permission to land. Yes, I sent for it. Cleaning up tHe mess PuccHin leaves is a job Germany is used to doing. Polonium 210 Poisoning Plan Dublin VX VIII Poison Gas Plan Mr. Shimaoka, what're those? Aren't those gas masks? Gas masks? Please evacuate! Anyone within a 5 km radius is in danger. Get moving! Get moving! What's going on? Nothing's going on! We need an explanation! Just hurry and go! Please, explain this to us! It seems the soldiers are wearing gas masks. What terrible thing is about to unfold? They're silencing the press. Those were gas masks... It seems martial law is in effect. Hello? Tokyo Sports NeWspaper Company Editorial Office I'm watching the news... Gas masks mean they might use chemical weapons. Are you safe there? Don't risk your lives just for a scoop, okay? We're okay. I need to check on something. I'll call you later. Hey, Sanpei! Let's go to that shrine. What for? They seemed kind of creepy. Like they resented outsiders... That's because they're hiding something! T o do with Guilala? Probably. Let's go! Everyone, I beg you to reconsider. Aren't chemical weapons banned under international treaty? Unless We destroy tHat monster, tHere 's no point in talking about a future for Japan. Is that so... If chemical weapons, then why not nuclear weapons as well? I misspoke. This is T akamine. This is T akamine. Dublin VX Vlll is ready to go. Dublin VX Vlll is ready. Mrs. Chancellor... Deploy. Deploy. Deploy. It's still alive! I spied Guilala overtHere in tHe field. His belly laugH resounded WitH joy. Dublin VX VIII Poison Gas Plan BrainWasHing Radio Wave Plan It really looks just like Guilala. What's that one? Got me... It's T ake-Majin. It's you! What'd you say? Take... Take-Majin. He'll beat Guilala. Is that a kids' show on TV? "Take-Majin"? Hey, wait! You have something to tell us, don't you? Right? What's going on? You again? We want to know about Guilala. Why is it carved up there? And if I tell you? I'm not sure. I just want to learn. I beg you. Please tell me! Come. This has been passed down from ancient times. It's Guilala... What does it say? "A devil descends from far up in the sky. The end of the world. Mountains die. Oceans vanish. Rivers full of bones. Of people...only shadows remain." The world gets destroyed by Guilala? "Who will vanquish the devil? Only the great Take-Majin. If it is not stopped..." That's where the scroll ends. Guilala came from space. Will Take-Majin appear the same way to fight Guilala? No. He has been here with us since ancient times. Even before our ancestors chose to live here, he was said to be the guardian deity of Lake Toya. He creates nature and safeguards those who love the natural world. So both that picture and this statue are based on myths drawn from imagination... Not actual observation like Guilala? Indeed, Take-Majin may not appear before us. But all people who live here feel him in their hearts. Their belief brings greater clarity than vision. Is something wrong? Nothing. We'd better go back now. If we miss the next G8 session, our boss will be really mad. Okay. What a great picture. Why do you like Take-Majin so much, Shinichi? Because... I don't know! He always runs away... I feel sorry for the kid. Are you family of his? No, I'm just his neighbor. His mother had a terrible time with his birth. She passed away. His dad, Toshio, raised him all alone. It must be about five years ago, now... Since he was killed in a landslide... When we found him, it was too late. Just before he died... Shinichi's here! Shinichi... Lord Take-Majin... He will protect you... I know he will... So he believed his dad. And since that time, he's adored Take-Majin like his own father. For him, Lord Take-Majin is an irreplaceable hero. So that's what happened. Lord Take-Majin, please hurry and beat Guilala! Otherwise, our village will be destroyed! Dad, ask him to save us. You promised he would. Or did you lie when you said he'd protect us? It was the truth. Take-Majin has always protected this lake... No...this whole country, since ancient times. And he always will. Sumire! Where did she go? Sumire! One, two... Neci-Coma! Then, don't forget to tilt your head. One, two... Neci-Coma! That's it! One, two... Neci-Coma! What're you doing! The next G8 session's going to start. I'm not going. Huh! I'm staying here to offer a dance for Take-Majin. What! I want to believe in him too. Did you get hit on the head or something? Get lost! Go take pictures of Guilala by yourself! I can't do that. What about the article? That's not important right now! Quit this nonsense. Let's go. I'm not going! We don't have time for this! Let me go! Just come on. Ow! You little brat! Leave him alone! He's just a kid! What are you doing? I'm just... We told you to leave. Yes, sir, we're about to. And we'll never come back. Let's go. I said I'm not going! Shinichi, wait at home. No. That's an order! No! Go home! I want to believe in the miracle of Lord Take-Majin. He's no god of yours. You defile the sacred lands he's protected for generations. He's too upset now to perform any miracles! Leave! Clear off! Come on, Sumire. I mean it, let's go! Sumire! I won't... I won't leave. Sumire... We can't even bring peace to our own cities! You people of this village are so much better! You respect nature. You help each other... You never lose a sense of gratitude in your god! Please, let me dance with you. DoWn in tHe lake, deep in tHe Woods... Sumire... After an eternity, He endured so long to stand before us. THe Warrior of tHe ancients, Take-Majin. Neci-Coma!

Does tHat mean it's going to run amok forever? WHat tHe Hell did you do? It's not solely a Question of losing face. It's a Question of WHat to do noW! Your entire country is in peril! I told you so. It seems our only choice is to use a nuclear weapon. Sir, what are you saying? Esteemed colleagues, your strategies have failed. Now it's my turn. My Potaedong 55 missile will take out Guilala. Potaedong? For years, I've wanted to hijack this summit. I stole Prime Minister Oizumi's identity data when he visited my country. These interpreters are all from my Pleasure Brigade! WHen tHe missile Hits, tHis place Will be irradiated too. The new Potaedong 55 has a limited warhead that only destroys within a 2 km radius. We're easily safe here. The UN inspection was a joke. The heads of the G8 are my hostages. As for Guilala... My Potaedong 55 will pulverize him! My time as King of the World has finally arrived!

What gives! Wait! Let me go! Hey! Let me go! Hurry! Dr. Sano! Is there really going to be a nuclear strike on Guilala? THis jerk pusHed tHe sWitcH! We're screwed... It's a limited warhead. The damage should be slight. That's not the point! Because of your various attempts so far, Guilala's spores have re-energized to the same level as when it was created!
