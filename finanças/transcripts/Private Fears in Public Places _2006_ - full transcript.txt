Tiny. Tiny? You mean... It's tiny. I wouldn't say so otherwise. Yes... The brochure mentioned three rooms. They're here. Two, not three. How do you mean? A large one here... The main room, say. And here... a second one... which was big too before being partitioned for some strange reason. Basically, we have one big room and two halves of another big room. Is that right? You think the second room was... Look at the ceiling. It's been cut in two. You're right... As for the window... It's obvious. It's been partitioned too. You should have specified two big half bedrooms, two half windows... and one ceiling cut in two. To tell the truth, this is a recent property and... Tell me... Two people sleep, one in each of these half bedrooms. The first one has the window open. The second has the window closed. What do you think happens? The brochure was... It's simple. Either they freeze together or they both stifle. It's the most desirable area in Paris... Yes, I'm sure it is. It's very pleasant. The Seine... The National Library, the pavement caf?s... A stone's throw from cinemas, shops, stations... I know, but the bedrooms are a drawback! My fianc? and I want a large bedroom with a bathroom, a guest room, smaller but not this cramped, and a third, comfortable room for my fianc? to use as a study. Can you imagine a study with a half window? Of course not. A study wouldn't work here. You think it would work in that box room? Right. Point taken. If your fianc? needs a study for his work... Not necessarily for work. He just wants a study. If it makes him happy, why not? What is he in, if I may ask? Limbo. He's looking for work. He's between jobs. I see... What direction is he looking in? All directions? I hope so. He said he'd be here. Why is he never on time? Perhaps he was held up. I can wait for him. I haven't had a bite to eat. Run and eat. Lunch is important. It certainly is for me. Do you work far away? Just round the corner, on Rue de Tolbiac. Rue de Tolbiac? Imagine if you lived here. I don't plan to work there forever. Sorry, this place just won't do. There are plenty more. I'll keep looking, never fear. I'll find the place. After you. Thank you. Very quiet, isn't it, Lionel? Very quiet, sir. Why is that? Do you know? No idea, sir. Perhaps because it's Tuesday. That's right. The hotel always slumbers on Tuesdays. There must be a reason. Not as far as I know, sir. People should be living again by Tuesday. Mondays, okay... True. Monday comes after Sunday. After Saturday night, parties... You see what I mean. You understand Mondays being quiet. But Tuesdays... Now that's a mystery. You did say it was Tuesday? Yes, sir. Tuesday all day. Shit! Something wrong, sir? No, I was supposed to be somewhere. Never mind, it's too late now. What's the time? Half past two, sir. Far from here? Forget it. Time for the men's room. Same again, Lionel. Same again, sir. You look as if you're frozen, Thierry. It's a little nippy. Anything new here? No, apart from Mr Lafarge who called for you. That's right, Mr Lafarge... - I said you'd call him back. - Wonderful. - When you had a minute. - I'll do that. You ought to call him now, Thierry. It's wiser. You're right, Charlotte. You do owe him a call. That's true. I owe him that. You're upset. Am I wrong? No. Did she like it? She found it too small. It seemed huge in the brochure. It is. The bedrooms are the problem. Too poky, are they? Poky? I'd say she finds them... too compact. That can be good. Depends on what you do. I meant for heating. They're easier to heat. That's what I meant too. Thierry! I must get back to work. So must I. I'll call Mr Lafarge. Well done. You have a lovely laugh. I do? When you laugh... You should laugh more often. If you say so. Thierry... I have a tape for you. A programme I recorded on Sunday. Really? Songs That Changed My Life. I told you about it. Yes, of course! Still, if you'd rather not... No, I'd love to see it. You're sure? I'd hate to... I hope it's recorded right. I never know where I am with my machine. Why do they make them so complicated? I wonder too. I wanted a basic one. But those shop assistants are such smooth talkers... I know. I'll get this back to you. It sounds fascinating. There's no hurry. If you like it, it's on every Sunday. I always miss it. I try to catch it but my sister Ga?Ile and I tend to play ludo on a Sunday. Ludo? Quite a tradition. Occasionally, we try dominoes or canasta but rarely. We're addicted to ludo. We used to play mah-jong with the neighbours but they moved. I'll watch it tonight. I hope you'll like it. It made me love life again. Just what I need. We all do. A shot ofjoy won't do any harm. There's so little on TV these days. I mean nothing that... Makes you love life? That's for sure. See you later. So, where were you? Me? I was mooching about. Drinking? I wouldn't call it drinking. Aren't you looking for work? Calm down, Nicole, there's no rush. Got any interviews? On Tuesday, I think. In a micro-brewery. Don't miss that one. They need an accountant. Dull stuff. Dan, I can't take any more. Find any job you can and work. You'll work with people and meet other people who work. Work is the way to get into the working world. If you spend your days in bars or in bed, you'll never find work. True. One point for you. Don't worry, I'll make it. What was it like? What? The flat. The one you saw today. Hopeless. You'd have hated it. Rooms fit for toddlers. You couldn't have got a bed in your study. Let alone a desk. No way, then. Dan... Why exactly do you need a study? I want a study, that's all. - What about me? - What? Why can't I have a study too? I'm not stopping you. What? We'd need a four-room flat. It's ridiculous. Besides, I don't need a study. Well, I need one. Just because your father has one? For instance. Can you tell me what you plan to do in your study? Sit there from time to time. Have a think. Write a few letters. To whom? You never write letters. I write all the letters. You've never written one in your life. Well... not recently. You used to write lovely letters. Perhaps if I had a study, I'd write to you again. I hope you'll be livelier once we're married. Calm down, Nicole, please. Calm like you, is that it? Six months without moving! It's time you stirred yourself! Especially... Especially what? Well, if I was... You see? How do you mean? We have to think about that, Dan. That's all I'm saying. Yes, we have to think about that. There you are. I was afraid I'd miss you. Metro trouble? The usual. You know how it is. Off out again? For an hour or two, yes. Every night's a party. You think so? Always with the girls? From time to time. How do you work after living it up all night? Don't exaggerate. Is it a new fad? I've read about drunken girl gangs. You know I don't drink. Did you get a frozen dinner? There's some cold meat left. It's alright, I got a ready meal. There's meat too. From Sunday. We need to eat it soon. It'll keep another day. We'll eat it tomorrow. If you're not out partying. Stop it! What are you doing tonight? I'll try to eat this thing first and then watch some television. There's nothing on. I have a tape Charlotte lent to me. - Who? - Charlotte from work, remember? Is she the uptight one? Uptight? I suppose she is a bit. I hardly know her. Fairly reserved though. She's not talkative, true. What is it? A movie? No, a programme she recorded for me. She was so enthusiastic, I said I'd like to see it. To be polite. So she recorded it. It's one of those religious music programmes. She's very religious. - Is she in love with you? - Please... Are you keen on her? - Am I what? - You blushed! That's enough, Ga?Ile! Stop it now. Out with you. Off you go! Great, I'll be on time for once. Enjoy your evening. You too. And enjoy your tape. It's hard to imagine life with a sister. - This way. - Thank you. Sorry, you're in the kitchen. The living room's his bedroom now. - With my father being... - Quite. - And with the stairs... - Of course. Who's there, Lionel? Who've you brought back? It's okay, Dad, don't worry. My father. Another of your bloody women? Lionel, I'm talking to you! - He's a bit... - It's alright. I hope she has a decent arse. Not like the last one! Try to ignore him. I'm used to all this. The elderly get aggressive. My father certainly does. We get through so many carers, you've no idea. The toughest one lasted only two hours. You can't blame them, can you? I don't blame them at all. I say carers are angels in disguise. I meant old people. You can't blame them. Most of them are scared of being alone, scared of being abandoned, scared of the darkness. Now you mention it, we leave a light on all night. It's costly but never mind... No, I meant the Darkness, with a capital "D". The black hole if you like. Darkness with a capital "D". Yes, I see. What are her tits like? I hope she has decent tits! I'm sorry, really I am. It's alright, don't worry. I'll introduce you? Then you go. I can manage. I've done this before. Really? I nursed my own mother for years. Same as me. For years too. Was yours very ill? She had... an accident. - A road accident? - No. Here's the list. I always leave it here. His usual tablets are by his bed. Keep them out of reach or he'll throw them at you. My mobile's here for emergencies. I work at the Globe, near the National Library... I hope she's a decent looker! Or have you got another old bat? Shall we? After you. - Mrs? Miss... - Call me Charlotte, please. My father's Arthur. He likes to be called Arthur. This way. Here we are, Dad. Charlotte's looking after you tonight. Good evening, Arthur. I'm very pleased to meet you. Bloody hell, she's the worst one yet! It's seven o'clock and time for G?raldine Castellani, as every Sunday, with Songs That Changed My Life. Her guest this week is the famous architect and journalist, Jean Lamarche. Songs That Changed My Life Good evening. The architect is better known than thejournalist who finds time to actively support numerous charitable organizations and who has recently been preaching on a daily basis to defend the homeless and the underprivileged. Welcome, Jean Lamarche. Your days seem to have more hours than ours do. You said it. When you're doing what you have to do and you enjoy doing it too, God gives you the time to do it. It's that simple. You just have to stay focused. Take things one day at a time... Where are you? Answer me, you slag! Where have you got to? I'm coming, Arthur. I was just heating your soup up. Three months to heat cat's piss? Here we are, Arthur. Lovely soup. Tomato and basil. The perfect soup. Doesn't it look good? Shall I put it down here? It's too late, I don't want it. Take the bog water away. You've won, you scrubber! Clean up the bloody mess and sod off! I told you. I don't want soup. I want a sandwich! I'll make you a sandwich, then. About bloody time, you blithering idiot! It'll just take a minute. That's better out than in. - Same again, sir? - Please, Lionel. Stick it on my tab. Thanks very much. As I was saying before my bladder rudely interrupted, it isn't easy. It isn't easy at all. I'm sure it isn't, sir. I'm talking about my fianc?e, Nicole. You remember Nicole? She goes on at me day and night to stir myself, to start moving and even do both at once. And I tell her, "I just got out of the army and I take the firstjob along?" Six months ago, I was a carefree career soldier, moving up steadily through the ranks, heading for a bright future... Next bloody minute, no fault of my own, I'm out on my ear. I see... - You see what? - I mean... - Excuse me... - Yes, sir. Gin and tonic and an orange juice? I mean, what they did... What my chaps did was wrong. Very wrong. I'm not disputing that. But the fact is, I didn't know about it. If I had known, I'd have stopped it, of course. Alright, I was the senior officer. I was the only officer present, yes. For the army, that makes me the can carrier. The buck stopper. But I didn't know it was happening so how could I have stopped it? I mean, how could I? Quite. There ain't no justice. There ain't no justice, old chum, is there? Certainly isn't. Same again, sir? Same again. Then I'll be getting home before my baby locks me out. Oh, no! Next week, G?raldine Castellani will play the songs that changed theologian Roger Monnier's life. Now, let's join the whole gang of The Big Parade on a visit to a very strange farm where the ponies have a few tricks in store. I don't believe it... I just don't believe it. I just don't... Bugger off, you stupid cow! Bugger off, will you? You scrubber! You ugly fart! Where d'you hide your tits? You haven't got any, have you? Just a slab of cement! Get back to your kennel, you bitch! I don't want you. Go on, get out of here! Leave me alone. We're closing, sir. Time to go home now. Lionel, old chum, I would appreciate just one more drink. - Sorry, sir. - Just the one... We're closed. Try the lounge downstairs. They'll probably serve you even if you're not a hotel guest. I don't want to. I hate going downstairs! I can't miss my metro. Good night, sir. Lionel, good old Lionel, my chum, my old mate, my good mate... Good night, sir. Red, red... What a bloody dump. I'm never drinking here again. Never again, you hear me! This is the last time. Positively the last time! It's over! Sorry, I was miles away. - Everything alright? - Fine. I checked. He's fast asleep. That's good news! Let's not wake him. Maybe I'll get some sleep myself. - He wasn't too... - Not at all. We had a few breakages. Nothing too serious. Just a couple of plates. Just a couple? You've done very well. We hardly have a matching cup and saucer left anyway. I noticed when I was washing up. I took the liberty. That's kind. You shouldn't have. There was such a pile, I thought... Yes, a towering pile. With my job, I find it hard... Things pile up. I don't mean to interfere at all but... don't you feel your father might be better off... How can I put it... With professional care? You mean, in a home? With proper medical care. Oh, no... No, I promised him I'd never put him in such a place. There are marvellous ones with the proper treatment and correct medication... No, thank you. He belongs here. No place like home. But surely there comes a time... I swore I'd keep him. Let's not exaggerate. As his doctor says, his case is far from desperate. Over-excitement is bad for his heart but otherwise... I get the feeling he's over-excited fairly often. That's nothing. You should see him get really over-excited. His leg's not getting better but the doctor says I can keep him at home unless, of course, the situation... worsens mentally. Well, it's your decision, and yours alone. In any case, he's lucky to have you. You're truly a good man. I'm not so sure of that. But thank you for saying so, Charlotte. Does that help? My bible? Let's say it's a comfort. I need it in moments of stress. It's good to have something to cling to. Yes, that's right. Well, I'd best be going. - I'll see to that. - Don't bother. I know where to get a cab. - Thanks, but I have Alice. - Alice? Alice is my little car. Old but reliable. She'll see me home safely. - You're sure? - Yes. Alice and I go everywhere. She's never a problem. Do you need petrol money? The only thing I need, sir, is my coat. Here we are. I'm parked just round the corner. I'll see you tomorrow, then. You're coming back tomorrow. That's good news. Actually, I think I'm here for the week at least. Until your usual carer gets back. Wonderful. I thought you'd pack it in like the others. I'd understand. No, sir, I don't run, I face a challenge. Life is full of trials that paralyse you. But if you don't overcome them, that makes him too happy. - Who? God? - No, the devil. The devil loves you to give in. God expects you to take up the challenge and resist. That's why he sends you these trials. Well... Good night. See you tomorrow. Good night, Charlotte. I'll see you to your car. I'll feel better. Nicole... Nicolette... Alright, don't answer. Go ahead, don't say a word. I couldn't care less. Nicole, I've broken my leg. It's me. What are you watching? I'm watching... I'm watching football. Football? You hate football. That's what I was thinking too. Alright? Excellent. Had a good evening? Terrific. - How were the girls? - Great. Had a good time? The usual. You didn't watch the game? Of course not. - You haven't eaten? - It was inedible. I knew it. Shall I cut you some cold meat? No, I'm alright. I can whip up a salad too. No, I'm fine, Ga?Ile. You can't go to bed on an empty stomach. I'm not hungry. I don't like this. Are you running a temperature? No. Cup of tea? Coffee? Sandwich? I'll make a sandwich. No. Nothing? You'll be restless. I'm glad I don't sleep with you. - I'll clear this away. - Thank you. - You're sure you're okay? - I'm sure. Just a bit tired, that's all. You look like a metro ran over you. Did you watch your tape? My what? The one whatsit gave you at work... Charlotte. Yes, I watched it. Any good? Boring. - Even for me? - Especially for you. Not your style at all. I'll have a shower and go to bed. Switch everything off. Good night. See you in the morning. I'm sure you're sickening for something. No, I'm fine. Sleep well. It's tiny. Not that tiny. It's minute. - It's not bad. - I'm not living here. What's going on? We wanted three bedrooms. Why do they show us flats with two? I said we'd consider two. What? I asked to see two-room places. I don't believe it... Three-room flats are thin on the ground, he says. - What does he know? - He's an estate agent! Sure. He's a joker without a thing in his books more like. The bloke's a clown. Tell him that from me. He's a joker. He'd prefer to hear it from you. Wait for him. He'll be here soon. I see loads of ads for three rooms. There are too many to fit in the papers. - Really? - Haven't you ever read a newspaper? Why didn't you call? Call who? One of the three million places to rent! You could have done something instead of leaving it all to me. Calm down, Nicole, please. I'm sick of it, Dan. Frankly, I'm totally brassed off. You're a lovely little thing. Cut it out. You don't like it? I keep saying it: Two rooms aren't enough. I need a study. It's simple enough. I'll leave you the living room, the master bedroom, the bathroom... Like I said, you leave everything to me. When it comes to the study, I'm standing my ground. Why do you need one? What? - What? - Stop saying "what"! Just like your father! What? What? What? Every time you speak to him! What? What did you just say? It doesn't matter. Please forgive me. The curse of our times. Vital, but such a nuisance. So, what do you think of it? Well... We both rather feel it's a bit small for our requirements. I said it might be, didn't I, Nicole? We wanted three real rooms for... A happy event? - What? - No. So Dan can have an afternoon nap. Like his father. I think that covers it all... Shall we be going? Yes, I'm late for work. After you, Nicole. Thank you. If you please, Dan. Hello. Hello, Thierry. - Any luck? - It's not what they wanted. I knew but they insisted on seeing it. It's a lovely location. It's perfect. With a wonderful view. Anything new here? - Not a lot. - Alright. By the way, I must return that video you lent me. There's no hurry. Did you enjoy it? Yes, very much. Good programme. I love it! I adore hearing what people chose. The differences are fascinating. Classical for some, hymns or oratorios for others. Some even choose rap music. It takes all sorts. Thanks for introducing me to it. I'll watch it from now on. Unless your sister objects... Sorry? It could mess up her ludo evening. Ah, her evening... Video is a blessing of modern life. Before, you'd stay stuck to your TV or you'd miss the best programmes. That's true. But now, you pop in a tape, set the timer, press "record" and you're all set to go out. Right. And the amazing thing is, you keep using the tape. Once you've seen it, you rewind it and record again. You could get by with one tape. Or two, say. You start again. No matter what was there before. Press the button and you're off. It comes and goes. It'll last forever. Brilliant. You have a lovely smile, Charlotte. When you smile... You should smile more often. I'll try to remember. Would you care to see another? Another... Another episode. I can lend you one if you like. Yes, I would. I'll get you one from my car later. - Grand. - Bring the other back. Of course. I may want to record over it. I'll bring it in tomorrow. I'll get going. I'll try to hunt out a three-room flat. Always on the alert. You can say that again. See you later. Good luck. That's better! You know, the thing about women, not that I have anything against them, is they don't recognize our need for solitude. You can't deny it. Man is a solitary animal, from time to time. Is that absurd? Not at all, sir. Males need to be alone. Females, never. That's why so few go into space or drive cabs. Or keep lighthouses. Whereas men are ideal lighthouse keepers. Still, no man is an island. That's true too. But I don't think Nicole and I can go on like this. When I speak, she snaps. She never listens. We don't communicate. It's tough. Very tough. I don't know what to do. The harder I try, the worse it gets. What would you do? Me? How can I possibly answer that, sir? You can. You're at the hub of the universe here. Take a break. Step back. It'll do you both good. You think so? No harm in trying. True, her flat is tiny. There's no room to breathe. There you have it. But... Do you know how a chap steps back? By seeing someone else for a change. Someone else? Just temporarily. Like I did a few years ago. We weren't going anywhere so we agreed to part for a while. We soon saw we were a good match, so we got back together for good. And lived happily ever after. Happily, yes, but not for long. She dumped you? No, she died. I'm sorry. That's a terribly sad story. It was a long time ago. Terribly sad. Anyhow, sorry to get back to me, but if I see someone... Just temporarily. How do I find someone? I don't meet anyone these days. Put an ad in a paper or a magazine. What? Or try a dating agency. Or even the Internet. No, forget that. I couldn't do that. You'd be surprised. It works. Those girls seem dodgy. And a dodgy girl won't be much help to me. She can be more trouble than she's worth. Depends how dodgy you are. Same again, sir? Yes, same again. I need the gents again. It's only me. I'm home. Hi! Just a minute. Alright? Hi, L?lette. - Everything okay? - Fine. Good. Off out again? Notjust yet. A cup of tea? I'd love one. Here or in the kitchen? Let's live dangerously and go to the kitchen! The kettle's boiling. Lovely. Don't give me piss-weak tea, you ape! Can't I get a hot woman for once instead of a rotten old trout? Where are you? You're not only ugly, you're idle too! But... At last. You're still up? I thought you'd be asleep. You couldn't sleep? No, I couldn't sleep, Dan. What? Listen to me. Are you listening? Are you totally drunk? Not totally. A little but not totally. Like me. I've had most of a bottle. God, what's happening to us? Dan... I decided something... - I came to a decision tonight. - So did I. Well, I'll go first. I want us to separate. Go away, for a while. I need to be alone. Alone? For a while, yes. Go tonight. We need to be apart. Just for a while. That's what I'd decided too. Really? That's good. At least we agree on something. We both need to step back, Nicole. Yes. Indeed we do. You realize I could meet someone? That's a risk we take. I could meet someone too. You? Why not? I'm still fairly presentable. You're fabulous. You're radiant, a real stunner... I don't need this now. You have the face of a goddess! Stop, please. No, I don't want to stop. Let me finish. I'm not listening. And your body, my darling, your body... Dan! Your body is like that of another fucking goddess... Shut the hell up now! And get out of here. Alright. If that's what you want. Sorry, I can't cope. Your things are ready in the hall. They are? See you. Well... I'll be off, then. I'm off. But... - I don't know where. - Your parents' place? My father's there at the moment. He wouldn't let me in. Don't worry. I'll find somewhere. Right... Ciao. Ciao. All things must end, Roger Monnier, and it's now time to choose your last song. I'm going to pick the hymn Onward Christian Soldiers. Any special reason? To be honest, wherever I am in the world and whatever mischief I'm up to, if I feel a bit down, a few bars of this song immediately cheer me up again. Roger Monnier, soldier, poet, novelist and landscape gardener, thank you for being my guest. Thank you. Thank you all. ...and a rather unusual criminal. I shall say no more. That's her. It has to be her. It's Charlotte. I'm sure it is. What on earth are you watching? You're back already? Where did you get that? It was on TV. I skipped channels and... How can they show such rubbish? What channel was it? Actually... What? It wasn't the TV. A tape? You were watching a tape? It was from a chap at work. He played a trick on me! You were sitting here alone watching a porn video? That's too pathetic for words. It's so sad, so incredibly sad... It was nothing, L?lette, nothing at all. What's happening to us? God, what's happening to us? L?lette... Thank heavens... Good evening. - Everything alright? - Yes, he's asleep. I just checked. - You're gifted. - Thank you. It's been a long day. Would you like a hot drink? Tea or coffee? Thank you but don't worry about me. Get off home. Your day must have been long too. It certainly has. Well, if you really don't need anything... - I'll see you to your car. - Don't move. I prefer to. This area... Round the corner, are you? Just a bit further. It's serious stuff. Some of it's pretty uncompromising. I'd forgotten. Uncompromising? Unforgiving, say... Forgiveness comes later. It does? When? In the New Testament. I see. In the end, we're all judged and forgiven. Alright, I see. As your father will forgive you one day. My father? Why should he... He's still angry with you, Lionel, you can't deny that. No. I don't know why but he holds something against you. Perhaps he had other hopes for you. That's often why our parents... Did your mother pass away long ago? She died three years ago. My father left us when I was fifteen. She lived here until she died. I came back to look after her. My relationship had just ended. She was so... She had... Well, it wasn't easy. It was... I'm sorry. It's hard to talk about. After she died, my father fell ill. I saw very little of him. But when I heard he was ill, I offered to look after him. The woman he was living with at the time wasn't... How can I put it? All she wanted was... Never mind. He moved back in and here we are today. Why did he leave? Why? Sorry, it's personal. I'm sorry. Of course. I say he left us but actually my mother... She was a very strong woman in her prime. She was a remarkable woman, in fact. I admired her in so many ways. And then, with her illness... The poor woman was in so much pain, despite the drugs. I'm well aware she was someone... quite extraordinary. I think she felt, rightly or wrongly, that my father... was a bad influence. A bad influence? On me. She was convinced of it. My father wanted... How can I put it? ...to interfere with my upbringing and she didn't agree. I think you're probably right. My father is disappointed. Disappointed by the way I've turned out. But I am what I am. What can we be apart from what we are? I often tell myself that. Anyway, she asked him to leave. She threw him out of the house and out of our lives. It's very late. I'm making you do overtime. See you tomorrow? See you tomorrow. Same time? Same time. I did say it wasn't right for you. No... Your fianc? will find it cramped. It's more for a single person. There's no room for a study. Right. I need to think about it. Don't take too long. This one will be snapped up quite fast. We've had other enquiries and this is a desirable area. Morning, Lionel. You're bright and early today, sir. The usual? No, just passing through. My morning constitutional. A constitutional? Really? A quick walk to get a breath of fresh air. I'm starting a new life today. Glad to hear it, sir. But why take a constitutional in a hotel? I'm living here now. I'm a hotel guest.
