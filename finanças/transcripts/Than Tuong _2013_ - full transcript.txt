Let's go around again. But... I wanna ease my mind at this moment. My mother passed away when I was born. Damn it! Have you gone mad? I don't care about anybody's feelings. And I will understand my mother's ideal. Three meetings, at 9 a.m. with the ringtone provider, - lunch at 12 p.m. with IDG Ventures... - Where's Long? ...golf with the directors from Hong Kong. Where is Long? Long is at the agency nailing the sponsor contract. Stupid clients can't make up their minds! We have sold ten times over already! Today, you are producers that were trained in the first production course. I want you to always try your best! Wanna do big business, follow me. And be passionate pioneers... for young generations. MUSIC PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT I found these two good guys. They are excellent graduates of a music production program. This is Ho Quoc Minh, son of Mr. Ba Khuong. A plutocrat who run multiple businesses. Very confident and passionate about the entertainment business. Damn it! His objective is to choose the best material, to make the best products. I'm here for a presentation. You are Cao Tri? Minh, Ho Quoc Minh. You are... 30 minutes early. That's my principle! Done! You can't finish drawing this church? Don't waste time! Give it to me, I'll print it out right away. No need to draw. What? Don't believe me? Let me introduce myself, sir! I'm Le Tran Nguyen. A graduate in Arts and Multimedia Design, and the owner of Nguyen On the Block coffee. Le Tran Nguyen? A name made up of three surnames? Police! Police! The sky is so high! Hi! Hi! Your street business is against regulation. I drive this motor cart around to give everyone coffee for free. No money so it's not a business. I'll give you this Nguyen On the Block coffee bottle for free, okay? This is Quach Cao Tri. A Chinese man whose son of the head of the Quach Gia Group. He is kind of a romantic artist. I was given a topic. These two guys will present it today. Sir, it's 8:45 and Cao Tri is not here yet. And Quoc Minh is waiting outside. Ok, let him in! Yes, Mr. Long! Ok, let's begin! There are more than 1,000 singers in Vietnam. Five new songs every day. Around ten singers debut every month. However, the demand for new product images is still very high! Because there are no true idols! This Super Idol Project targets the audience ranging from 15 to 24 years old. that makes up 20% of the population. The main clients are beverage, technology, and cosmetics companies. Let me repeat. This is a Super Idol project. I've heard a lot about many Super projects like this. But nobody could answer how long we would see profit for. What a good question! Still late even now? Old habits die hard! I'm out now! Do you need to project anything, Tri? No, thanks. It's been a long time since we've had a true idol in the industry. Nowadays an idol is defined by what we see and hear. It doesn't come from music which sees through our soul, and listens to our feelings. Also, idols now can't really sing. They dance well and dress fashionably. And we call them "Idols". They're just normal people, who put on jewelry and spit out meaningless sounds. I want to create a true idol. Well done! Sounds romantic, doesn't it? How much for this project? The audience doesn't care how much the music costs. What they need is the emotion. Good! I knew who you would choose from the start. I'm glad that you understand me. I don't think it's good. Tri may not have the experience but he knows what the audience needs. Your audience just pays a few pennies for a ticket. But Minh can get me billions from ads. Speaking of making money, Minh has to call you a genius. But as for creating an idol, Tri is the right choice. Money is money. I don't mind where it comes from. The paper idol can be drawn by anyone! This is your money. It's your decision. There's no damn friend in showbiz! When your mother passed away, your father had this room built. He sits here a while every morning before leaving for work. - Hello Mr. Tri! - Hello! Nice to see you! Hello, Mr. Tri! Which school do you want me to go for your graduation? I really want you to be happy with me. I tried my best at the schools I attended. Of course I'm happy, but being a father, you have to take care of your kids for your entire life. I've arranged a position in the company. When are you coming to work? I didn't say that I would work here. - Now you're disobeying me again? - No. Are you going to work? - No. - Are you going to be a bum? - No. - You want to see me die? - No. - Are you going to work here? Yes. I'm sorry, dad. I can't work here! Please give me one year! If after one year I still can't do anything, I will obey you unconditionally. You even have conditions for obeying me? No, dad. I wanna give it a try, 'cause I don't like being in this hell. Hell? Alright, you have one year. And I will not give you anything else. You'll see what hell is! FREE COFFEE NO BUSINESS I hung this sign to avoid the police. But whoever owes me money, I will tell the police. Nguyen On the Block - Hey Nguyen! - Huh? - You studied art, right? - Yeah. - You drew all this stuff? - Yup. So what? You like it, don't you? Actually, my future plan is to open 1,000 Nguyen On the Block coffee motor carts... - all over Vietnam. - 1,000? - Yes! - How many of them now? One. Are you shaming me? No, I'm planning to open a music company. Are you interested in the Art Director position? Director? I'm serious. Yeah. You're right. Asking the CEO of a coffee chain to be the Director is reasonable. How many people in the company? Two. You and me. Hey Long! Great! From now on, Minh is officially a part of Viet Idol. Welcome! Hope we'll get along well. Very good! I want to search in Saigon to find the hottest girl who is the best dancer in town. I like this! With the budget we have, this place is not bad. However, it's quite far and dirty. But don't worry! This Art Director will transform this useless wood into a work of art. IDOL CASTING We have to make this sign strangely ugly, uniquely ugly, terribly ugly, and offensive ugly to make a deep impression, man. My legs are tired! I've dreamed of being part of the Viet Idol family for a long time. And today I'm so lucky to have my dream come true. Wow! This girl is as hot as a Nguyen On the Block coffee cup. Why don't you support us? Why did you go there? We don't have much money, so we have to work harder. No singing! The media is right, showmen are old goats. I'm sorry! I am not what you think! I didn't mean that either! Give me a chance, please! I... don't want to be a singer! What a pervert! Enjoy your meal, mom! Na, why didn't you invite me before Linh? Linh invited you so quickly, I couldn't stop her. Enjoy your meals, auntie and Linh. Enjoy your meal, mom. You too, cousin. Let's eat. Hey, Linh! Are you busy studying these days? If it's too much, quit your job and focus on your studies. The exam's coming! Na, I told you not to play with the bowl while you eat. My company is going to do some recruiting. Get the degree and you'll be able to work in the office. If not, you'll be out on the street. That's miserable! Na! Focus on your meal. You're just here at night. Auntie doesn't let me say a word when I'm home all day long. Let's start now! And now performing from The Voice of the Ward 4 is Thuy Linh. Oh my. Too dark! As the result of the house owner cutting off the electricity rudely, the program has ended for now. Please accept our apologies! You pervert! These pants don't have a zipper. Safe! I never want to be a singer. Even if I were a singer. I wouldn't work for a pervert like you! That fruit isn't delicious. Let me choose for you. Were you born a leech? Hey hey, what are you doing? Stay away! I'll call the police. I'll scream. Have you zipped up yet? Done! Really? This house, right? You're not that bad! Just a little bit bad. Goodbye. Who are you looking for? - Have a drink! - Thank you! It's green tea! In this house we only drink green tea. It detoxifies and prevents cancer. By the way, what's your name? My name is Tri, ma'am. Don't call me that. I didn't give birth to you. Are you Linh's classmate? No, miss! So are you her co-worker? Not either, miss! I came looking for her to... Please leave! This is a private house, not a theater. There's no singer in this house! - I'm sorry. - But wait! You forgot this. Bring it home too. Just give me five minutes! Just this once! Why do you keep looking at my zipper? It's safe! Five minutes! I met your mother this morning. What? Calm down. After I met her, I understood why you're really determined not to be a singer. Even when I'm zipped up. I know that... your father left your family because of art. But you're still luckier than me. My mom passed away after I was born. For over 20 years, my dad always told me that art killed my mom. But how can art kill someone? Art gives artists an ideal to strive for that normal people will never get. I believe that... my mom and your dad both believe in that ideal. I also have that ideal. But I don't have any ideals. I'm a normal person. Have you ever wanted to understand your dad? I really want to understand my mom. I decided to follow art when I was a kid. So I lied to my dad about studying at two universities at once. Because I hope when I live in art, I will be able to feel my mom's world. I will hear her voice. And I will understand her ideal. What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about which songs you and I are going to sing tonight. Whichever you want. Whatever songs you choose, you will sing them beautifully. Hi Long, I forgot to tell you this morning... the boss saw that Minh likes your office, so he told you to sit in his office for now. Bye. METRONOME MUSIC COMPANY RECRUITING FOR TALENT MANAGER POSITION Are you crazy? We can only pay a low salary. Why did you need to post on such a big page? Who's gonna see it? I thought posting on this page was cool. That's why we're both sitting around these days. Nobody's coming to work. Is he blind or something? Everyone runs into that door! - You're hiring, aren't you? - Yes. Long? Are you kidding? We don't have enough money to pay you. So I'm not welcome here? No! No! Welcome! Welcome! But how do you know about this place? I saw it on Vietwork. Please have a seat! I read through your project. It basically has four steps. Training, Producing, Communication, and Business. Those who've come are all crazy weirdos. How can we find someone to train? Again? I think I'll have to take that door off. Linh! I have one condition. You're beautiful, that's within your rights! I need a place to stay. I will tell you the reason later. I can arrange that for you. And a place to change clothes. Attention, you guys! Our plan includes voice training, physical training, song composing, recording, and releasing an album. The first album has to be successful! Physical training? Run! Oh man, I just wanna sell coffee! I don't wanna be a singer. Why do I have to run? Keep running. Jumping rope 1,000 times a day. Why did I quit selling coffee... to allow him to torture me like this? One, two, three, four, five, six The chorus is the most critical part of the song, with the movements. Down! Up! Down! Up! Anyone who wants to get close to Linh will have to kill me first. I think you already look like you're dead. Minh Tu's client will be beverage and technology product companies. - Hey Nguyen! - Huh? Why does Tri always listen to the cassettes? He's old for his age. He's not young, energetic, and hi-tech like me. Haven't you seen he still uses pencil? They're all keepsakes from his mother. Even those cassettes were hers too. Listen to me! I don't like talking about love while I'm at work. Bye honey! If you can't control your emotions, you'll never make it on stage. Linh, have some meat! It's a little sour! Delicious! Millions of V-pop fans... Hey guys, look! ...the biggest musical event from Viet Idol. On December 18th, 2013, Minh Tu will officially debut. Let's wait for Viet Idol's next big hit. We have to make a move first ‎if we don't want to feel ‎the pressure from this big hit. December 11th, 2013 On these nice days, I'm usually busy going to weddings. Cut, cut, cut! Focus and wake up! Sing every note and beat correctly, ok? Hello! Ok, got it! What's wrong? We missed a piece of info from our competitor. Thuy Linh's team is debuting before us. Long's gang is our competitor? They should know their place! I don't care how we do it, make it 7 days earlier! What are you looking at? Give me all the updates tomorrow at 7 a.m. sharp! Don't cover your face. Can you see me clearly? I... I can't see. On the stage, standing under hundreds of bright lights, how can you make each audience member feel when you can't even look into their eyes? Music is magical. Singing well isn't the most important thing. Filling each person with emotion is what music truly is. Because on the stage, if there are one or one thousand lights shining on you, you should see with your emotions, listen with your soul, and sing from your heart. Long, Long. Tri always lisps. Why is he speaking so well today? This is the stage. Step onto it. Are you scared? Don't worry. Music and your imagination will take your fear away. What's wrong? What the hell! Focus on singing. It's not a circus. It hurts me when I see my singer get dirty like this. I have a question! Minh Tu, how'd you feel if there were a competitor vying for your position? To me, art can be the sky or a colorful flower garden. This is not a place for jokes. We only have 48 hours left. Whoever doesn't work the right way will be fired tomorrow. You! Get out! The rehearsal press conference is so real. Impressive but so expensive! You gotta spend money to make a lot more. The next two days will be crazy. Yes. Why are you standing here? You catch a cold or what? Na? Auntie read my texts with Linh. This is your "volunteer job"? It's going well, isn't it? Please let me explain! Call me ma'am, boy! Mom, let me explain please! I don't want to hear! Auntie, auntie! I'm not your aunt. - Auntie, auntie! - Call me ma'am! Let's go! - Auntie, Auntie! - Auntie Shmauntie! Watch out! Ok, Auntie Shmauntie. No no! I said to be careful with that door! Tri, have you contacted Linh yet? Tomorrow maybe I'll call everyone to cancel... the press conference. SO HE'S NOT A WEIRDO BLACK COFFEE OR WHITE COFFEE? IT'S GREAT TO FOLLOW YOUR DREAM! WHY DIDN'T WE MEET EARLIER? AND IT FEELS LIKE... My mom is downstairs. Someone is talking about me! SO HE'S NOT A WEIRDO ‎I HAVE ZIPPED UP BLACK OR MILK COFFEE? ‎IT SUCKS! WHY DIDN'T WE MEET EARLIER? ‎ARE YOU THAT DESPERATE? IT FEELS LIKE... ‎LOVE 100. 1,000. Keep going! Only 10,000 more! Where have you been? I didn't know how to climb down at the end. Let's have breakfast! Linh, Linh, Linh! Your mom's asking you to deliver food now? Leave this heavy work for me, Tri or Long. My poor singer! Ouch! Long, have some breakfast. Linh, your mom let you come here to pack your stuff? I've convinced my mom. She's softened up! It means she didn't approve? No, she gave me six months. But I have to go home at night. Then I'll go home too. The deadline is six months, but we only have one more day until the press conference. PRESS CONFERENCE - SINGER THUY LINH ‎She's mine! I don't understand why Minh chose the same time as the competitor. There are a bunch of events every day in Saigon. It's important that the influencers see us. Reception needs the VIP list. Double check the big commercial clients. Yes, sir. The boss never goes looking for the minions. Got it. I believe Minh Tu will go further! Minh Tu's music is very modern. That's good. I think Viet Idol is very lucky to have a talented producer like Quoc Minh. I have a question! Yes, please go ahead. Can we start now? Yes, please. Can Thuy Linh sing folk music? Aside from her beauty, does Thuy Linh have other skills? Well... Can I sing a song for you? Just for me? If only one person wants to listen to me, I'll still sing. Thank you! We already have a three-year plan for Minh Tu. I really have faith in my professional crew. We say no to scandals. Tell the marketing team to take a look at Minh Tu from Viet Idol. MINH TU - NEW IDOL VIET IDOL'S NEW BIG HIT SUPER IDOL PROJECT ANNOUCED BY VIET IDOL VIET IDOL'S SUPER PROJECT MINH TU WITH BILLION DONG SINGLE To reaffirm your request, Minh Tu isn't allowed to have plastic surgery and no scandals, to align with the "100% natural... from nine healthy herbs" message. Is that all right? And commit to winning an award this year. The product image is so important to us. Certainly, absolutely! Collecting awards is Viet Idol's hobby. REPRESENTATIVE A - REPRESENTATIVE B Honey! Can you eat spicy food? I'm not the jealous type. Your boss really pampers you, doesn't he? More than you do, that's for sure! Depending on what kind of pampering you get. Later, ok? I gotta take Minh Tu to meet the client. I invited you here because this girl is pretty, but not famous. That suits my budget now. If she wears my outfits and appears at every pharmacy in the country. Hooray! She'll be famous real quick! HERBAL EXTRACT LEONURI Don't drag me to meet such commercial clients again. Hello! Long! Luan said that wherever your girl is, his won't show up. Hope you'll understand. I got it. Thank you. The 18th stage refused us. Music is made for listening, not for begging. Those are the market rules. It's all about business. Music is not a product for trading! Why is this noisy crap popular everywhere while we have to beg people to play ours? Kim Don Ich Mau was founded five years ago with only ten billion dongs of capital. A couple of billion dongs can put pressure on my son? Dad? Didn't I tell you? Music is cheap! The time isn't up yet! Don't jump to conclusions, Dad! Just because time isn't up doesn't mean that Quach Gia's son can go begging such companies! Dad, I have to go now. Next week is the anniversary of your mom's death, come home and eat with me. I really wanna help you for old times' sake, but we have to compete for page views. Linh is still unknown. It's hard for me to convince my boss. I understand, buddy. Thanks a lot. Hello! - Long? - Yes? The rent is almost due. Yes, I remember, Sau. Uhm, bye! The money for burning discs, printing, photography electricity, water usage, and costumes needs to be paid soon. You're really devoted! You weren't held by her even once, but you always remember the anniversary of her death. When she was alive, she gave you the nickname Cacao. But she didn't have a chance to call you by that name. My dear son, I want to tell you about my dream. The dream of working and singing on stage is a beautiful dream. And I will follow my dream, although your father doesn't believe in my dream. I believe your father loves me, but I don't believe in the way he badly judges music. Music and art have brought us together. That's why I've always kept my passion to prove to him how beautiful art is. A true artist always has his own desire to serve the audience. We simply need to bring feelings to them. They will always remember and respect us. I hope in the future, whatever occupation you may choose, you will always have a pure soul. Be honest with your ideals and truly serve others. And you will inherit all the rhythm of the feelings that life offers, my son. Mom, I heard you! You mean singing for free? - Yes. - There'll be no money? Right. So we wouldn't make it on the news? Right. Wouldn't get on TV? - Right. - Then what would you sing for? I think Tri is the leader here, so we should trust him. DO YOU KNOW THUY LINH SINGER? ‎HER FANCAM AT THE NURSING HOUSE. Auntie, it's Linh! Dung! Who's Thuy Linh? Her image must be on our page this week! THUY LINH - A NEW IDOL PHENOMENON ON SOCIAL MEDIA THUY LINH - MUSIC NARROWS THE DISTANCE THE ORPHANS' IDOL THUY LINH IMPRESSED THE ELDER FANS I'LL SING EVEN FOR ONE PERSON Three. Long! They just called from TV! METRONOME'S SHOW SCHEDULE Congrats, Metronome, on this spectacular comeback! Tonight is the last night we're here. We have to leave this humble abode soon. Cheers! - One, two, three, cheers! - After today, we will rent a place that looks nice and professional. Starting now, we will open a new chapter for Metronome. Yes. When you look at the audience, try to find eyes looking at you, then look straight into them. At that point, 1000 audiences will believe you're looking into the eyes of every person there. Please try to set up the music system, so our singer can rehearse in the morning. Ok, thank you. Do you see the stars up there? Very beautiful, right? And very bright too? We won't see them tomorrow morning. But actually, they're still there, shining bright. And this light, if you switch it off, it turns off. There. See? I want you to be a star. You shine your own light, not because of me, or someone else, who gives you fake light. Goodbye for now! And see you. Hey... Hello Long! Hello Tung Leo! You're really talented. Your singers are all popular. This is my boss. SHOCKING NEWS - THUY LINH IS A HYPOCRITICAL IDOL Long, you must have read the papers. My boss just called and we had to change the guest. Hello. A rabbit which catches butterflies is still a rabbit! No matter how a turtle crawls, it's still a cow! Nope, still a turtle. What are you looking at? Wanna play with me? You should know where you are! Heard it? Got it? Catch it? Remember it? Tri! Calm down! Hey. Help me, help me! Why did you have to make a fuss? If you use your influence, what do you need me for? If you use this, I'll stay here. But if you use this, you're on your own! I'll say it again. Don't screw up my beautiful victory! Beautiful, my ass! What's up? Boss! I've got nine stories for you since this morning! Take a look. See, boss! She's famous for singing for charity. But she left her father hanging. Such a hypocrite, boss! I feel bitter in my throat! She's really done it. Not yet! There's more. - What? - Take a look at it, boss! The guitarist famous 20 years ago is living a miserable life. It's hard to recognize any glory from the old times. Surprisingly, he's the father of Thuy Linh, who's in second place for the New Artists nomination. Even though she has a glamorous life, she doesn't dare to accept her father. Is Linh worth being an idol for young people? This will go to air at 8 o'clock tonight. You did an excellent job! We'll take advantage of her dad first. Play like snakes hiding in the grass. The famous guitarist is the lost father of the rising singer Thuy Linh. Are they talking about my future father-in-law? What does it mean? Turn off the TV. Let's see what they are doing! Being famous is hard for her! A few days ago, someone came and gave me money, then asked me to tell the camera that she had left me. She didn't consider me her father. She doesn't know where I live, how could she leave me? - I was a guitarist - Yeah. - In my old days. - Linh! I got a lot of attention from women. But I didn't care. After that I had trouble with my wife and we got divorced. I still miss her mom and her. I've memorized all of her songs. I practice with my guitar every day. I just hope I can play for her someday. You can cry on my shoulder. Thank you! Damn it! Everything is bull shit! I don't know why you want to break up. That's the reason! You don't know what I really want. I respect your career, but you haven't respected my feelings. Even when I care for you, I have to follow your principles. I don't have the right to think of my lover like the other girls. It's okay. You didn't know what feelings are. Goodbye! Why are you drinking alone? I've never seen you so sad before! Sad? Drinking alone is good. Life is strange. Nobody can see emotions, but nobody can hide them. I'll go first. Lights off? We want the best product standard, not the compensation from you. Thuy Linh seems so hot these days, huh? Don't worry! I know where my game is. You're beautiful and your voice isn't bad. You've given so much to Tri and Long. It's more than what they did for you. Thank you. I think Minh Tu is the true star here. If you come to us. Minh Tu is still behind you. I'll pay double what Tri and Long pay you. He has something that you'll never have. Thank you. Bye! That's my respect. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Who wants to watch you dance like this? Your moves are so stiff! Only one week after the Viet Music Awards, Minh Tu will hold her first live show. It's going to be the best music show of the year. Viet Idol seems to be confident that Minh Tu will be the winner at the Award ceremony. We can't sit here and watch Minh Tu win. Actually, we still have enough time. Right, but we need to be more proactive. Minh Tu has her show after the Award ceremony. We'll do Thuy Linh's live show before the ceremony. Be proactive. Our company doesn't have enough money to do a live show. If it's a goal, I will certainly find a way. Hello! This is Le Tran Nguyen, Art Director of Metronome, the top entertainment company! Yes, Long? Yes, in the living room? Here it is. How could he forget the performing license application! ‎MORTGAGE FILE Here it is. License application for performance. Long! Wait! Wow! Long, this style looks like someone right? What? It's more beautiful, isn't it? Right? VITAMIN - PROUDLY COOPERATE What's going on? What do you mean? Why did we have sponsorship? That's not a big deal. Don't you think we're successful? Successful? Have you forgotten your goal? Still on my mind. Who told me that - he wanted to make true music? - Me. Who told me that he didn't want to corrupt his singer's image with commercials? Me. Who told me that a singer must sing? Me. You're a leader! But why don't you keep your word? A leader has to lead the company to success. And because of that. I can't lose to Minh. Who told you we would lose? The Award ceremony hasn't taken place yet! Wake up, Long! Linh still has three million votes less than Minh Tu. Three million, not three thousand. Why do we have win by all means, when you're even not yourself anymore! I made money for the company. I didn't betray it! But why didn't you tell us in advance? You also didn't tell us that you had met Luan. You all think the clip of Linh's father was a coincidence? Minh's gang wanted to take advantage of this to defame Linh. It's me who settled that case. But I didn't say a word. So I was wrong too? Only the winner can judge what's right or wrong. I don't wanna lose to Minh anymore! What for? To become another Luan? If you were like this from the start, none of us would've followed you. None of us would be here. And Long didn't have to pawn his house to save us, to save your ideal. Pawning your house? You're crazy! Ideals are never real! The company has to survive! If it dies, no ideal can save it! Tri! You're not the person I knew. A man doesn't necessarily have ideals, but he can't betray the one he has. But they were all wrong. Ideals can never bring us to victory. We're behind Minh. I'm so fed up with this ideal! Tri! Listen to me! Now, this is truly who I am. Damn it! Are you crazy? You're tired and bored of this. Okay, to hell with you! You can change into Minh. But you can't turn Linh into Minh Tu! Do you care about her feelings? Why can't I change Linh? I created my singer. She's mine! I don't care about anybody's feelings! You... Damn it! Forget the whole thing! Let's break up. I miss the days at the old place. It was a hard time, but we were so happy. At that time... Tri was very carefree. And a little childish also. He always made me smile. Tri's smile is also beautiful. I always felt happy when I stayed close to him. It was like I could truly be myself. Long. Do you feel like hating me? Why? Because Tri loves me? I'm worried for him. How about the compensation paid for the sponsor? This is my job application. I made a mistake and failed. I'm in debt. Can you lend me some money? I won't accept any money until I've paid it back. Hello boss! Hello boss! Here comes the coffee. For Linh. For Long. The voting line is open till the show ends. Then we will congratulate your Minh Tu. We all thought the award had been decided two months ago, but there's a sudden competition between Minh Tu and Thuy Linh. They are new artists this year and it's also the spotlight of the award. You're not playing again tonight? Oh no, I'm a professional musician, I gotta go to lots of shows! The award for Favorite Singer of the Year goes to Noo Phuoc Thinh. I'm good now. Let's go to the theater. Linh! How long have you been here? I've been waiting for you since this morning. ‎My group would like to give you this. And now is Favorite Band of the Year. And Favorite Band of the Year goes to 365. Next is Minh Tu! Camera Two ready to follow MC! And now we'll present, the award for New Artist of the Year. The first nominee has been leading the top chart for many months, Minh Tu! NEW ARTIST OF THE YEAR Why do many people vote for this crappy singer? And now, we're coming to a very special girl. She doesn't have any MVs but suddenly appeared in the top 20, and quickly moved to the second spot on the New Favorite Artist chart. And now let's welcome and vote for Thuy Linh! Don't cover your face. Because on the stage ‎if there are one or ‎one thousand lights shining on you, you should see with your emotions, listen with your soul, and sing from your heart. I'm sorry. Today I'm not singing the song that brought me to this Award. Because... there's no one to play guitar for me. Why weren't we informed about this change? I'd like to take a moment to thank two people. The first person is a singer who has a beautiful heart and a true love for art. She passed away 20 year ago, but thanks to her soul and ideals, I've met a person... A very wonderful friend. Without him, I wouldn't have taken my very first step into music. And I definitely wouldn't be here now. For me, to get where I am now is already a huge success. The four of us always carried each other's burdens. I'd like to sing a song from 20 years ago. In order to honor her lost soul. Hey, this girl is cheating. Why don't you cut off her performance? Fix it by any means. I can't afford to pay back this contract! Who the hell is this new singer? People are scolding me out there! Who is he? Why is he playing guitar here? Ideals... Ideals are useless! I dare you to say one more thing about ideals. Dad. Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emotional victory! And we believe our audience will never forget this amazing feeling! The feeling that Thuy Linh and her father gave us. Please give them a big round of applause! Take care of Minh Tu's contract violation! Contact Thuy Linh right away! Don't feel bad. I'm very proud of you. I'm fine. The awards are given out every year anyway. How about me? We are a team! What are you laughing at? You're happy we lost? Tomorrow we'll sort this out in the company! People should know their place. But... sometimes there's an exception. Let's go. Come on Linh! We booked a restaurant to congratulate you! Go ahead and take my dad there first. I want to stay here for a while. No singing anymore and the media is right! The showmen are perverts! Sorry I didn't mean that! I didn't mean that either. I don't want to be a singer! Linh! When I heard the guitar, I thought it was you. I was very happy! So you weren't happy when it was your father? Is your mother here tonight? Who's talking about me? It was so yummy but you keep rushing me back. Long, it's Tri over there? It's him! Only you don't know that he is here. Bastard! I thought you were dead. But how could you be dead, you're my friend! You still owe me a cup of coffee!
