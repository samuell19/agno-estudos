Excuse me. I need to return these please. You can't return them unless there's something wrong with them. Shhh... The point my friend. The point. The point is it's mathematical. It's cause and effect. Action and equal and opposite reaction. Even with emotions in the equation, you can calculate the outcome based on hypotenuse. You take five eggs and you bash them together and they change form but they're still just five eggs and laughter even when it stops it's still there because you can hear it in your memory. Eggs. Your favorites. I'm a vegan. A vegan? You think this is fucking Star Trek. Can you smell the smoke? It's burning my nose. Can you smell it? I can't smell anything. Stay here. It's not safe. What are you doing? I was looking for some plaster for my cut. Is this a plaster? On the fucking planet Vegan is this what a plaster looks like. Who are you? Where am I? I want to go home. I want to go. I want to go home. It's OK. Everything will be alright. I'm looking after you now. I made you breakfast. My family... my father, Louis, he's going to be worried about me. You're in deep shit. Do you know who he is? Have you got any idea what he could do to you - - I won't take this shit from you anymore. You always test me and push me and belittle me I knew you'd come back. I always bought eggs so you can bake those sponge cakes and Madeira cakes, and go swimming and feed the birds when the Madeira got stale. The sparrows always go at night but they come back. You're like a sparrow Helen. Who's Helen? What did she do? Don't fuck with me. You planned it all along. You left me to starve. I left you to starve? Am I Helen? Am I Helen? Am I Helen? Does this belong to Helen? Does Helen have one of these. If I'm not Helen, then by process of elimination he who isn't Helen can't be her, which makes her you. Do you know me? Do you know yourself? You don't even know your own name. They got to you. They've erased your memory. I can't remember everything. I can't think straight. I found you in the city. You were sleeping. I'd been looking for you for weeks, since you got lost. I was lost? You lost everything when you stopped taking your medication. My medication? I don't want them to take you away. I'm not your girlfriend, or your wife or whatever. I don't even know you. I've never met you before. Maybe I just look like her, like Helen. Don't do this. I'm just saying, these things happen, and that people make mistakes and maybe if you take a really good look at me you'll see that I'm not her. And that doesn't mean we can't be friends. You're Helen. You're Helen. OK. If you say that I'm Helen then I'm Helen. After all I'm the one with a hole in my fucking head. June the eleventh. 7.36am. Raining. April fourth. 3.20 in the afternoon. The burning started. It's not the same. Who are you talking to? You. I'm talking to you. My head hurts. I don't know your name. I mean, I don't remember your name. Aiden. Aiden. Can you show me around the house Aiden? Yeah? Can you take the rope off. It's hurting me. It's protecting you. But I've got you to protect me. Can you just loosen it a bit? Please. Don't you have any work today? No work at all? How are we going to pay the bills if you don't go to work? What colour are my eyes? Blue. Will you be alright without me? Yeah. You won't be worried? No. The baby's crying. Be a doll Liz. I expressed a bit last night. It's in the fridge. You see to her. You're her mother. Yeah, and you're her God mother. Didn't I make you her God mother? Didn't you promise you'd help out. I’ve got a head ache. You've got a headache. I've got a job interview. Shut the dog up. Shut the baby up. Come here. Come here. Oh good boy. Good boy. Come here. Come on. Oh yes, yes. What are you doing? I can't find my perfume. Why would it be in my room? It’s worse than we thought. The hind leg will have to come off. Will he be able to get around OK? Depends. But more importantly he needs surgery to stop some internal bleeding. The cost could run to 700. I don't have that kind of money. Four fifty. I need more. Maybe there's something you could do for me. I don't think so. Fine. I see you're immune to my charms. Three fifty, four fifty. Would you be interested in my watch? One fifty. Done. He slipped away peacefully, like he was sleeping. Can we call someone for you? What’s up? Liz. Have you seen Jackie's necklace? What necklace? My necklace. It's my nest egg. What are you, a fucking chicken? No I haven't seen your necklace. You bitch. I know you took it. Just put it back Liz and we can all forget about it. You know how Jackie is about that necklace. It's virtually a family heirloom. You stole it from Myers. It's not an heirloom. It's a crime. And I haven't seen it anyway. Is that it then? That's all you're going to say. What do you expect me to do. Turn her upside down and shake her? I’m not living like this anymore, Dan. I'm not having that bitch in my house. She’s your sister, not mine. It turns my stomach watching you hanging around her like a dog on heat. I want her our of here. Alright, calm down. Nice one. She must have won this playing the stock market. Get out here. I'm on the toilet. I don't care if you're up to your knees in shit. Where’d you get the money? What have you been doing? Nothing. I haven't done anything. Don’t you lie to me. I can read you like a fucking book. Get off me. It’s not enough that Mikey has to die because you're too stupid to look after him, but now you come in here and you steal from us. I didn't steal anything. I had to pawn it for Louis' operation. What operation? What's wrong with Louis? I ran over him. Jesus Christ. What is it with you? You can't even be trusted to look after a dog. Where is he? It was an accident. Where is he? He's dead. You won't be happy until you destroy this entire family. It's not even my fault. If you hadn't left the front door open - - Oh that's fucking rich. That's right. You blame everyone else. When are you going to wake up to yourself. Calm down. Jackie, it's just a dog. No. It's Mikey's dog. That dog was the only thing he had that was his. The only time he came outside his own head was to play with that dog. He was a good kid Liz and all you had to do was look out for him one night a week. One fucking night a week. God. Look at you. You're a black hole. You suck the life out of everything. Go out Jackie. Take the baby. Go to the park. I'll sort this. She’d better not be here when I get back. There's only room for two in this flat. Lizzie, I can fly. I thought this is where I'd find you. There's only two places to go around here, one of them is up. She doesn't mean it. All that stuff about Mikey. She doesn't really blame you. She doesn't have to. You have to go. OK Now. Where am I supposed to go Dan? It’s been six months. It's not like we haven't been good to you. Oh you've been real good to me Dan. Don’t be smutty. I love Jackie. Do you want to take that filthy thing off the table. You might get a disease. If you don't teach those dogs to behave I'm going to have them put down because they've been barking all day, and wash your hands, dinner is almost ready. You'd better eat it before it starts talking to you. Is something wrong? Yes. I forgot. For you. For coming back. What are they? Flowers. I know but what kind are they? Flowers. They're funny flowers. They make you laugh. They're nice. Put them in water. No. Stop. No. Don't. It's late. Don't. It's late, I'm tired. You're my wife. I'm not you're fucking wife. Lies. First past the post. Take it all down and there's like no tomorrow. No. No. OK. No. Listen to me you fuckwit. No. Aiden. No. Listen to me. Don't. Don't. You're hurting me. Don't. Don't. You'll hurt the baby. Our baby. You'll hurt the baby. My baby? Yes. It's your baby. Don't hurt your baby. If we set sail for Trinidad we can be there by the morning. Shush. He can hear you. There. Can you feel his leg? No. What's this? A necklace. People don't wear these. I thought you'd be pleased. Oh yeah. I'm so happy I could piss myself. I need to piss. Really. Can I get up? I can't feel my legs. Paralyzed. I'm paralyzed. The chicken. I'm poisoned. No more walking barefoot for you Mister. Swing from the trees like an Orangutan. I need to piss. I'm bursting. Don't leave me. My legs. It's pretty serious. I don't think you'll make it. I think we should get an ambulance. Where's the nearest doctor? No. No. No doctors. OK. Alright. I know what's wrong. Don't cut my legs off. No. It's the circulation. We are going to have to warm your feet before gangrene sets in. C'mon Aiden. OK Aiden. You're going to have to help me out here OK. We don't have much time. One banana. Two banana. Can you feel that? Can you feel the water? You can't feel anything at all? Aiden. Listen to me. Where are the keys to my car? We're going to have to get some help. The river. What? You threw my keys in the river. I put the whole fucking car in the river. OK. Stay here. I'm going to see if I can get some help. If you feel any heat on your legs you don't take them out OK? They're going to fall off. OK? Yes? What's for breakfast? Eggs? No. No. No more eggs. No more chicken. Beans? Beans, beans, good for the heart. You ought to take better care of yourself. Is something burning? Where? No I mean can you smell something burning again? No. Dog shit. Can you smell it? No You should get your nose fixed. Aiden. Aiden, I was wondering if you'd like to take some medicine. Medicine? I'm not sick. Ahhhh. See, disease free in the twenty first century. I know that you're not sick, now. But maybe, this is just to make sure that you don't get sick. Because if you get sick, then I could get sick, the baby could get sick, and you don't want that to happen just because you didn't take some pills now, just in case. Do you want to take some more. It says on the packet you should take four. Go on. Don't let it get cold. What's wrong? I don't like it. I forgot the sugar. Do you want me to play with you? I taught you to play. Remember? How could I forget? I forget. Sometimes. It hurts to remember. I can remember things from a long time ago, but I can't remember people's names or places I've been even from last year. What do you remember? From a long time ago? When you were a child. A lot of things I guess. I can remember Space Dust, you'd put it on your tongue and it would go all fizzy and feel like there were explosions in your mouth. You used to write me little lists. Notes? No. Lists. So I wouldn't forget. Every day you used to give me a new list. Some days it was wash-the-windows day, or clean-the-chimney day, or fix-the-fucking-hose-on-the-washing-machine day. Some days you'd write a little heart at the bottom of the list. In the beginning anyway. Why did you stop doing that? I don't know. I guess that's the way things go after a while. The romance dies. When I was about fourteen or fifteen I had my first serious boyfriend and he used to write lists all the time. And one day I was looking through his school bag and I found two lists in an exercise book and one of them was a list of all the countries that he wanted to visit, and at the top he had Spain, and it was followed by France and Norway and Mexico, Turkey and Israel, and the other was a list of all the people that he loved and right on the top of that list was my name - I was so stoked. And then a week later I wanted to see the list again. Because I needed to relive that feeling you get when something good happens and so I found the list of countries and he'd put number one next to Turkey, and number two next to Mexico and I couldn't even bring myself to look at the list of people that he loved because I knew that he would have put numbers on that as well. Lists suck. Cut that out. You're like a kid with a new toy. And your hair is sticking up too. You look like you just got out of bed. Cut it out. Or what? Or you'll be seeing stars. Don’t make me angry. You wouldn't like it when I'm angry. I don't like you anyway. I tolerate you. I put up with you. That’s not very nice. Is it? Yeah, well life isn't always nice. And it's that much harder when your husband has the IQ of a ten year old. Why did you have to say that? Because you fuck up everything. You ruin everything. Do you know how annoying it is having that thing in your face all the time. But you gave it to me as a present. Yeah. Well I thought it would mean that I'd have more time for myself and I could stop baby-sitting you. Fine. I'll put it away then and I won't use it ever again. That ought to make the world a safer place. Fuck off and leave me alone. Go. Mostly I just wanted you to see yourself this way. I used to love you when you were sleeping. Now I just love the memory of what you were like when I truly loved you, and I've tried Puppy, I've tried to believe that things will get better. I can't waste my life with you. I hope you can get your head around that. Aiden. I made some soup. Aiden, what's wrong? You can tell me. Do you want me to leave the soup here? I am not the creature from the black lagoon. Of course you're not. Did somebody say something bad to you? Nobody loves me. Everybody thinks what you see if what you get. But what you see isn't always me. You shouldn't talk like that. Of course people love you. Everybody has someone that loves them. Who? You have me. Who do I have? Your parents. Your mum and your dad? Your dogs. They love you. You can see it in the way that they look at you. My dogs. My dogs. I had a little brother. He was slow. Most of the time he didn't even seem to know if you were in the same room as him. He was a genius at figures and fractions, you name it. If you asked him a question, like, what's the square root of 13,456. Without even thinking about it he'd know the answer. And a lot of the kids on the estate they used to tease him, so I had this special T-Shirt printed for him - and it said 'If you think I'm stupid. You're not very smart.' Hey, it does not matter what people think - - You never told me you had a brother. What else have you kept from me? He died. A long time ago. Long before we were married. But you never even mentioned him. That's unnatural. How did he die? It's a long story. You can tell me. That's what I'm here for. It's a bit of a long story. He fell. He thought he was flying and he ended up falling. It's snowing. I need the bathroom. Have you been poisoned again? Frostbite. I need to pee. Aiden. If you love me you'll untie me. The temperature is going to drop to minus seventy tonight. There's going to be a blizzard. Let me go you crazy fuck. Let me go you twisted fucking moron. Pssss. I can't. Not while you're looking at me. Pssss. Don't look at me. I've been holding on so long it's hard to get started. Ten, nine, eight, seven... Wait. Six, five... Wait! Four, three, two, one. Blood! I'm losing the baby. I'm losing the baby. Get a doctor. Get a doctor. Get a doctor. The baby will die if you don't get a doctor. Go. Go. You’re not making a lot of sense Aiden. She's bleeding. She needs a doctor. I think you're confused. Come inside, I'll call an Ambulance. No. No. We don't have time. Well. I'll leave a note for Maggie. But she's dying. OK. No need to get wound up. Who are you to say the world isn't round. If the world was flat all the ambulances would fall off the edge into the abyss and no one would be any the wiser. OK Aiden. You can stop worrying. My bag's right here. Is Helen back at the house? When did Helen come back? Aiden. Have you been taking your medication? Every day? I want you to take some deep breaths Aiden. See if you can do what I'm doing. Good. Now keep holding. And holding. Still holding. Now exhale slowly. Let the air out so you can take some more breaths. Take the dogs out Aiden. I need to work in a sterile environment. I'll want you to boil some water for Helen and bring it to me. Water? Yes. And make sure you scrub your hands after touching the dogs. You poor thing. What's your name? Elizabeth. Liz. I'm going to call you Helen. Do you understand? Now, I just want you to relax and breathe normally. Where's the water Aiden? I want to see the baby. Not yet. This is woman's business. Like in the old days - - This is not the middle ages. The man always waits outside. We’ll need that water soon Aiden. Can I rely on you or not? It isn't very warm Aiden. I'm going to give Helen a small injection No. No needles. No needles. Don't you hurt her. I'm not trying to hurt her. Sweetie. You're going to have to be brave. Aiden. We need to get some privacy for a minute. Please wait outside. No. No. No. No. No. He's just trying to help. Can you wait outside please. If I need you I'll call you. I'll tell him you need to go to a hospital and you've got a blockage. But I'm sure with expert attention you and the baby will pull through. I'll talk to Aiden about it. Are you alright? Don't worry sweetheart. I'm going to get you out of here. What did you do to her? Her condition is stable. For now. She's got a blockage and if it's not removed she could lose the baby. She could even die. I think it would be better for everyone if Helen comes with me. No. Now listen to me Aiden. This is important. She's got a blockage. She needs an operation. She needs to go to hospital. You can't take her to a hospital. She's a Vegan. Do something. Aiden, where's the doctor? What did you do with him? Aiden? Helen. Listen to me carefully. This is important. There's a blockage. They put an implant inside you. It's taking over your mind. What did you do with him? You'll have to work with me to get it out. Let me up. Let me up! My Helen. I'm not Helen. I'm not your wife. My name is Liz. I've never been married before. Christ. I never even finished school. My head hurts. Your head hurts. Your fucking head hurts. What about me? You think it's alright to tie me up and paw me. You think it's alright. You think I like being busted up. How do you like it? How do you like it. How's that. How's that. You wanted sex. Alright. Alright. This is not love. You don't love me. And I sure as hell don't love you. It's all the food you're going to get for three weeks. I'm flying out to Barcelona in the morning. So eat up. This could be your last meal. Where's... Helen? What did you say? I want Helen. Where is she? Are you a friend of Helen's? What's happening to me? Am I in a hospital? Are you a nurse? You're dead. This is heaven. I'm dead? Are you dead? There was a nuclear war. Everyone's dead. Helen's dead? No. No. Don't get yourself worked up. No one's dead. You're a psycho. I'm just fucking with you. Don't leave me. Miss! My name is Liz. Did I hurt you. Liz? I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. Eat. Save your strength. How long have I been away? I don't know. When did you stop taking your medication? I don't know. I woke up and I was alone. Did Helen send you? You really don't remember? It's confused. Bits and pieces. I remember you had flowers. Did you have flowers? You gave me flowers. Why would I do that? Why would anybody do that? I don't know. How long do your pills last for? Two, twice a day. It smells in here. We should get you cleaned up. What is it? I thought … Sit on the bath. Here I am. Sortof. You're a lot younger than I thought. Did I do anything bad? No. I never mean to. Sometimes stuff just happens. Stuff happens to us all. Your dog died. Remus I think. You stabbed him. Why would I do that? I don't know. You had a smell up your nose. It was getting to you. You could smell shit everywhere. If you have to be a little bit mad, wouldn't it be nice to be able to smell strawberries or chocolates all the time. Yeah. You could get fat just on the smell of them. Remus was Helen's dog. He had a bad temper. You couldn't even wash him because he'd bite your hand off. What's that? It's nothing. Is it sore? It's a nipple. Really? You've got three nipples? Yeah, and three testicles. You're having me on. Yes. Just about the testicles. It really is a nipple. Can I touch it? Yeah. Helen cared more about that horse than she did about me. There were times when I thought she'd have me committed just so she could have the house and the horse all to herself. What? Nothing. My bum is sore. You have a weird sense of humor. You were trying to kill yourself, in the car? No. I was just drunk. Do you always try to kill yourself when you're drunk? No. Usually I just dance. I want you to take these. They'll help you to sleep. What are they? Just Valium. You woke me up so you could give me a sleeping pill? I made you smile. I don't want you to wake up in the middle of the night. Stay with me? Who's there? Who are you? That's my dress. Why are you wearing my clothes. Where's Aiden? He's sleeping. Helen? Do I know you? We haven't met. Liz. I'm a friend of Aiden's. Bullshit. He doesn't have any friends. Why are you covered in dirt? I was going to bury your dog. What happened? Aiden reversed over him by accident. Let's go inside. It's getting cold. You still haven't told me what you're doing here. There's been a bit of drama since you left. I'm not interested in talking in circles. Where's Aiden? Oh Aiden. Puppy. Oh baby, I'm sorry. It's easy to be sorry now. What do you mean? Who do you think you are? You're the reason he's trussed up like a pig. Who the fuck are you? What have you done to my husband? I've done what you should have done, I've looked after him. I've kept him on his medication. You have no right to tie him up. Do you have any idea how distressing it is to be restrained like that. It's the worst thing that you can do to someone with his condition. How does it compare to a fond farewell on a video tape. You have no idea. That's the fucking understatement of the year. Don't do that. Don't do that. He's not stable. And you are? He's not dangerous. He's more likely to hurt himself than anyone else. And you think Remus killed himself? You said that Aiden rolled over him. That's when I thought you had feelings to protect. What's in there? See for yourself. Oh my God. That's Dr. Holden. What happened? He had a heart attack. I think. What do you mean 'you think'? What are you doing burying him. I don't know. I don't know. I don't believe you I don't care what you believe. He just, he … I don't know. He had a heart attack … This isn't happening What's that? What? Shine your torch over there. That's just great. Why doesn't he just park the truck in the fucking living room. Look, I know you're having like some 'house and garden' moment here, but in case you forgot, there is a dead guy in there. What are you doing? I'm calling the police. That's not going to help anyone. Aiden needs help. He needs to be in a secure environment. Locking him up will destroy him. He's better off out here, away from everyone. If you hadn't left him, none of this would have happened. I think you've had enough to say for one night. If he's so bad to live with then why come back? It's none of your business. You're making him sick. You knew what would happen if you left him. You want him to be institutionalised. Don't be ridiculous. He's obviously wearing off on you. You didn't even come back for Aiden. You came back for the house. I'm doing what's best for him. And I don't intend to justify my actions to you. Fucking signal. What time is it? It's after two. You had a long sleep. I heard voices. I thought I heard Helen. You must have been dreaming. I'm going to make you something to eat, but I want you to take these pills first. Do you want to … No. Are you OK? Yes. Thank you. That's Helen's car. Yeah, of course it is. Are you sure you're alright? You're acting a bit strange. It's been there the whole time. The whole time? Yeah. It's been here as long as I have. Did you block it out? I don't know. That's good Aiden. It's a sign that you're getting better. You're not blocking things out anymore. You're seeing things for real. You gotta let Helen go. Maybe we should get rid of it so it doesn't torment you. What was I doing …trying to move the house? I don't know what you were thinking when you did this. You can get it out? Yeah. Piece of cake. Y'know what's really weird? You? You'd think I'd remember that. It smells funny in here? Don't start. Not psycho funny. Just stinky. Did you dump my car around here? I sold it. For scrap. You said you dumped it in the river. I'm unreliable. Aiden, you have to stop. Slow down please. Good afternoon Sir. Do you mind switching the engine off please. Now the reason you're being stopped today is we are conducting roadside interviews into the disappearance of a local gentlemen, and we're asking members of the public if they might be able to help us. Now, ah, you live around here? Sir? Yes. We're at Beacon Valley. Have you been away in the last three days at all? No. No. Just local Do you know this man? Are you sure. Have a good look Sir. He is a local. That's Dr Holden. He's, he's a lot older now than in that photo. So, have you seen him in the last few days? No. Is there something the matter Sir? Is he dead? Like has something bad happened to him? And who might you be? I'm his wife. I'm Helen. So, have you had any personal contact with Dr.Holden? Well of course. He's our family doctor. How long has he been missing. I'm afraid I can't answer any questions at the moment. Can I see your license please Sir? Thanks, won't be a moment. Dr Holden was at the house. No. You're just confused. We'll talk about it later. It seems that your towing license expired two months ago. You shouldn't be carrying Sir. That's my car on the back there officer. It broke down this morning. We're just taking it to get fixed. It's not a paying job. It's just for private use. Have you any ID? Um... I think my purse is in the back of the car. I'll just, I'll get it. No Aiden. It's fine. I can manage. I only seem to have my credit card on me. Is that OK? Is the vehicle registered in your name? Yep. Please wait in the truck if you like. Thanks. What are you doing? Don't make a fuss. Here's your card. Now, since this is a private matter I'll let you off with a caution this time. But you're not licensed to carry any vehicles until you get a road-worthy certificate. Did you understand? OK Is everything OK? Yeah. My husband is just a bit upset. We've had a death in the family. Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. It was very sudden. OK, take it easy Who died? What do you want? Detective Superintendent Harper, Detective Sergeant Reece. We're looking for Aiden Price. What for? We're investigating the disappearance of Helen Margaret Price. Well, he's not here. Then you won't mind if we have a look around. Do I have a choice? We could do this quietly, or we can come back tomorrow with a warrant. Suit yourself. Harper. Come and take a look at this. Are you alright? What's going on? Cops. They're looking for Helen. What is it? What have you got? I'll have a better idea in just a sec. Christ. It stinks. Show a bit of respect, Mate. Shit. It's just a dog. Any relation to you? Let's finish up inside. Babe, can I just get the two of you a bit closer. I want to get you both in the same shot. Ready? Hello. Good boy. Oh big boy. Do you think he's got my eyes? No. But he's got your nose. You think? Definitely. Yeah. I still don't get the red hair though. It must be a throwback. Yeah I know. I know.
