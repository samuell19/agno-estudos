GOD CREATED HUMANS THEN REALIZED THEY WERE UNHAPPY AND SENT THEM THE DOMS THEY MIGRATED, PLAYED MUSIC AND SANG IN THE HOPE OF TOUCHING HEARTS… - Come here. Come on! - Hey! Hey! Come on, get over here! We have two oxen already. What the hell are we gonna do with this? Don't say that, Sefure. Those oxen are putting food on our table! Damn it! If you treasured your dong as much as the oxen, we'd have a kid! I'm blushing now. Watch your language, love! I'll make you blush! Come here! Out of the way, Piroz! This ox pimp, this dick less jerk sucked the life out of me! You parasite! - I never pimped for oxen! - You know you pimp for oxen! - I'm Kalender the Helper! - Hey! - When have you helped us? - My reputation spans four worlds! - Just chill out. - Come here! It's all rotten. Piroz! Good man. Good man. Come, bring that here. Let's show it to the good Master Mürşit. Look, you see this? Like this, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup! - Easy as that, all right? Ready? - Uh-huh. All right. Let's do this, guys. Hold him down, hold him, hold him. Hold our master. Now, let's see where it is. Open up. Up, up, up, up, wide. Open a little more. Oh, there it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep, yeah! Ah, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Stay like that. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Yes! Oh, look at that! The root is like the horn of an ox, master, look. - The top side is kaput. - Hogir! Hey, Hogir! Yes, Hatun. Your dad's run off again! Here, master, hold this. Here's your tooth. Here you go, huh? - Let's go get Dad. - Come on! I'll just put this here, and it will ease your pain, okay? All right, we'll be right back, master, yeah? And I'll gently shove the door aside, shake the mud off my shoes and go inside. Then I'm gonna say, "Dilo, I've finally come for you." And I'll exclaim, "Here I am! I came back! I'm home!" Hey, weren't you with Grandpa, last night? He had me write some poetry before bed. Brother, take the road down there. Let's cut him off. - I'm on it, bro. - Oh, Grandpa. He just can't help himself, really. You will look deep into my eyes. You will. And then you'll look at my flowers and back up to my eyes, and then you're gonna say, "Mirze, let's get out of here, Mirze." - "Let's go." - Dad! Oh, please, not them. It's my kids! Hyah! Hyah! - Dad! Slow down! - Leave me alone! Stop the car! Hyah! Giddy up! - Dad, wait. Dad, Dad, wait! - Get out of my way, boy! - Come on, Dad, you're embarrassing us! - Stay out of my way, boy! - I'll show you embarrassing. - Brother. - Brother. - Yeah. He's going to Dilo again. What do we do? Tell him if he follows us back to the village, we'll bring Dilo to him. He'll buy that? Oh, he will, and if not, we'll take him by force. Hey, Dad, let's go back to the village. No, I'll go to my Dilo. Stay out of my way, boy! But, Dad! Don't "but, Dad" me. Go home now, damn it. Get lost! Don't do it! Don't. Dad, don't. Dad, just relax come on. - Stay out of my way! - Don't! I swear I'll fall off! - Shit! - Go! We had to. I mean, Dad, Mom died less than a month ago. And you're already going out and chasing down other women. She's not just any woman. Dilo is mine! Dad, you should respect our late mother's memory. I mean, how could you do this to us? This is outrageous. Nonsense! Your mother's gone. But my heart's always belonged to Dilo. Her parents didn't give their blessing. But if they had… …it would've put an end to your mom and I. All right, enough. Stop it. Piroz, we have to get everything ready for tonight. You should go now and prepare the instruments. Ah! - Nedim, come on. Hurry up. - Here. He's gonna be the death of me. I swear. Come on, move it, run. Let's go! Wait up! - What's that? - A wedding dress. The color's bland, Mom. Darling, all wedding dresses are white. There's no other colors? Baby, put this on. Look, you left our home before wearing a wedding dress. We're mocked by everyone. And besides, you can't have a wedding without one. There's a wedding? Am I allowed to dance there then? Of course you are, baby. Yeah. Oh. Try this dress on. Fine, I will. Just wait out back okay? Sümbül the bride isn't into that. Don't play non-rhythmic pieces, you know? Make it cheerful. In fact, make it very cheerful. Don't bring people down. You have my word, sir. We'll play so cheerfully that the grandpa and the grandma of our soon-to-be-bride Sümbül will rise from their graves to dance. Listen, just blast the shrill pipe all night, all right, guys? Don't worry about it, sir. We can use our lungs for a long time, yeah. Listen, if you play well tonight, I'll give you not one, but two pennies. - Huh? - How generous. I assure you, you don't need to worry about that. God give your lungs strength. Yes, thank you so much. - Brother. - Yeah. I need to find somewhere to pee. Back in a sec. All right, man. But do it quickly, all right? Sümbül! Time to go, baby. Hey, bro. Wow, wow, wow! Look at that showoff. - All right, stop it, Uncle. - Hey, Piroz, what's with you? I'm fine, bro. I wanna play well for them. - Yeah? - Give them a good show. - Yeah, of course. - Nedim. My lungs aren't what they used to be, so you're on the shrill pipe. - I got it. - Great. And remember, guys, the best man said only play cheerful stuff. If you forget any notes, don't worry, leave it to me. - I'll take over from there. - I got it covered. - Yeah. - Hey, don't stand around. Go have fun. Move, move, move, move! Hello. Are you the groom? I am. That's a beautiful suit. I wore this for you. Well, would you do anything for me? - I would. - Hmm. W-What's that? Stop it, baby. He's your future husband. Will you sing it for me? I will. Go ahead then. You sound just like a donkey. I'm your husband. I demand respect. You should have advised your daughter on how she needs to treat her husband. Hey! Hey! - Hey, there she is. - There she is. - So happy for you. - Very pretty. Thank you. The veil… Congratulations! I'm so happy for you both. What is she doing? Hey, that's rude. Is she crazy or something? Wait. What'd you say? What did you say? - Piroz. Hey! - Where are you going? Hurry up, let's play. All right, and one, two, one, two, three, four! - Let me go! - Gimme the gun! Put the gun down! Try to keep your heart at ease. I've done nothing wrong. Those who have shamed and cursed your wedding day. God will smite them all. I thought she was innocent. She was the opposite. The girl wasn't a virgin. Don't think about it. Just try to stay light-hearted. - Whoa! - Godspeed. Thank you. You take care. - God be with you. - Yeah, goodbye. Giddy up, girl. Let's go, Nazli. Dad, he's awake! Wakey-wakey. Thank God you're up. That fight broke out at the worst possible time. It cost us a ram. - Where's the bride? - What bride? The one who was at the wedding. They went that way. Yeah. Which direction? Bro, where are they? Well, the groom is taking the bride back to her father. - Bro. - Yeah. That bride. - What? - She's my sweetheart. Your sweetheart? That's it. She fell for me, and I'm head over heels for her. - Oh, yeah? When was that? - Yeah. - Well, it was right before the wedding. - Wow. - Listen, bro. We need a plan. - Huh? What can we do now, Piroz? The groom's returning her to her father. Also, the girl wasn't a virgin. - You sure about that? - Uh-huh. Oh, thank God! - Hey, bro. - What? - I-I know that her heart is pure. - How do you know? Because like I said, our hearts connected. Then we must find a way. What do we do? - Well, bro, there is a way. - And that is? - Ask for her hand. - Yeah, you're right. Let's do it! In God's name, we'll ask her dad. Right now, the groom's returning her to her father. It's only fair that we ask her dad about it. Yeah, you're right. Turn around here and we'll go ask her dad. Hold your horses. Let's go to the village first. We have to ask Dad for his advice. Ask Master Mirze. - Oh. - Yeah. Father. Dad! H-hey, Dad! Oh. Oh, God, who ties up their father, really? Ah. Wow. Hey. Yeah, that's it, boys, untie me. - Perfect! I'll be with my Dilo after all! - Yeah, sure, yeah. Uh, Dad. Listen to me. I'm proud to be your son, so I'm gonna bring Dilo to you. - You promise me? - I promise on all I hold dear. Dad, I'm sure you can relate. Turns out your son has fallen for a gazelle. - Piroz? - Yeah. Is she really like a gazelle? She's like a gazelle, Dad. Her ankles are slender? Yeah, like a stork's. When do we go and get your gazelle then? - How about we go tomorrow? - Oh, God. Let's go and get her. That's great! We have sunny days ahead, huh? I wanted to be your son-in-law. Your daughter has put me to shame. Would you like to handle that, or should I? Sümbül is my daughter. It's my job to clean up this mess. Damn, woman. Would it kill you to add cold water? Your horn dog dad and brother are going to bring trouble our way, Hogir. I know it. Hey, Mom, uh, when can I get married? Hey, you stay out of this. Why'd you smack our son? If it goes well tomorrow, Piroz will have a wife. - How about your dad, huh? - Huh? - What are we gonna do? - Hatun. He's pitching a tent as he walks around the village. Not appropriate. You gotta be kidding me. We'll figure it all out, all right? There you go. Right. Look how pretty this is now. I brought roses. You loved them. And violets, remember them, hmm? Ah, but violets are for Nazli. Roses are yours. Hogir, who's her family? Where we going? She's Master Seymen's daughter. Yesterday was her wedding, but the groom sent her back to her father. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. So, we go there, and he'll give his blessings, huh? - Why wouldn't he? - Mm-hmm. The girl's now disreputable. The groom's given her back. He'll agree to it. That's right. The heart wants what it wants. - Master Mirze. - Yeah. Were you the one Dilo wanted? Hold up. You ox pimp. Dilo and I belonged together. Who wanted who is irrelevant. You dick. I'm just saying. I went to Master Seymen's to breed his cows. - And? - The girl is so lovely and so wonderful. She has a light of her own. Darkness does not call her home. Dad, let's hurry. We don't wanna be late. - You packed the fiddle and tambourine? - Yes, sir, it's all packed up. We'll go with our fiddles and tambourines without delay. Let's ask for her hand. Piroz, when will Dilo be here to meet me? Will she meet the bride? Come on, Dad. Is Dilo my mom now? Why introduce them? Shut up, boy! Dilo is your mom. Your mother's whom your father loves. You tell 'em, Piroz. - Hey, Kalender, you got a minute? - Yeah. - Gotta tell you something. - Go ahead. Look, everything's fine with this, you know, but what about this situation with my dad? What should I do? What is it? What's wrong with him? Well, we gave him our word that we'd bring Dilo to the village. Ah! You didn't tell him that Dilo's loyalty belonged to another? And Dilo's dead now. You didn't tell him that? I swear, if we were to tell him Dilo's dead, he'd burn our whole world down. Just explain that now she belongs with God. You're kidding, right? Come on, Kalender, we need a way out of this. - For pity's sake, we need your help. - There's always a way. Your father's too horny, and you can't cure him with prayers and hex bags. Then what can we do? You have to start to think outside of the box. When we have an ox that's too horny, we just give him a bale of hay to play with. Then with Godspeed, we'll take care of business, then head back to the village. Let's go. Come on! How could you do this to us? What did we do? We don't deserve this. You've sullied your honor, baby. Don't worry about it. If my honor is sullied, let me clean it. Get a washbowl and a bucket. Let me clean it up. What'd you do, my girl? Who hexed you? ♪ I have a kid His shirt is white ♪ ♪ He hops around like a goat ♪ ♪ He sees a gazelle and chases her ♪ ♪ He doesn't know whom to ask But he still needs to ask ♪ ♪ So here he is before you ♪ ♪ Seymen Aga ♪ ♪ Seymen Aga ♪ Ah, Mirze. I have no clue what you're talking about. Whatever you're saying, just talk plainly like any man of honor. Look, Dad, you need to be clearer, okay? And more gusto this time, all right? ♪ Don't let your kid Be heartbroken ♪ ♪ Don't let my kid be heartbroken ♪ ♪ Don't let my kid sleep alone ♪ ♪ Don't let your kid sleep alone ♪ ♪ Seymen Aga ♪ ♪ Seymen Aga ♪ Stop that, you fools! Father, just tell him plainly. How... you have any ideas on how to ask him about it? Master Seymen, Sümbül is your daughter. That's right. And Piroz over here is my boy. - Well, I suppose he is. - He is. He is. Master, my boy has fallen, and he wants to be with your daughter Sümbül. He's fallen where? What Mirze is trying to say is we that we are here to ask you for the hand of your daughter Sümbül. For her to marry our boy Piroz, sir. All right, I see. I see. That's great. What could be better than two people understanding each other? Am I right? Listen up, you. You came here as friends, but we're not gonna part as friends. - What have we said? - I have no idea, Dad. Riza! Who's Riza? Uh, yes, Father. Go call your brothers. All right, Father. - Lots of brothers, I guess. - Hmm, yeah. Maybe they all wanna be here for the good news. I wish they hadn't roughed up Master Mirze. That wasn't right. Still, my dad was brave enough to speak his mind. A father will do anything for his son. Why didn't you hit anyone? Huh? Those guys were huge, Grandpa. Huge schmuge, little man. Can't you throw a punch? Huh? Garbage! Hey, slow down! Whatever. I swear, Sefure. I swear, it's your twin. You honestly think making this is the answer to Mirze's problems? Of course, it might be the answer. I want you to make it woo me. Huh? Go on. - Really? - Really. I'll make the man fall in love with it, Sefure. You'll see. I'll see? - You'll see. - I did see. - You saw what? - And I still see it. You still see what, Sefure? Actually, it's really about what I'm not seeing. You know what I mean? How about you let me see what's up with that thing, you impotent pimp? - Get out of here! - Hey, stop it! Wait, wait, wait, wait! - I've had it with this shit! - Stop throwing things! Write this down, Nedim. What's that, Grandpa? Don't you just love roses? Gotta love violets too. Ah, but violets are for Nazli. Roses are yours. Hey, Dad. Let me see. - Hey, Dad. - Huh. Yeah. Violets are for Nazli, but roses are yours. - Hey, Dad. - Hmm. Dilo. What's wrong with Dilo? Nothing's wrong, Dad. Did Dilo pass away? No, no, Dad, God forbid. Dad, great news. I brought Dilo like I promised. You're the best son a father could ask for. Now where's my Dilo? Huh? - Let me... - Was it violets or roses for Nazli? Where's my Dilo, huh? Where's my Dilo? Listen, Dad, Dilo's a little sick right now. Well, I can look after her. No, not that kind of sick. You can, uh, see her, but you can't approach her. You can talk to her, but she can't speak. And the doctor had a strict warning. If Master Mirze gets near Dilo and touches her, he said Dilo would die. Don't you just love roses? Dad. Don't even think about crossing that line. The doctor told us that if you do, Dilo will die. Go, please leave me alone with my Dilo. Let me catch my breath and share some words. Come on, let's go. I'll breathe with her, and I'll stay right here. Dilo. Dilo, welcome. Welcome, Dilo. Say you're sick, huh? I'm glad you're here. I'm so happy. You're not in any pain though, huh? Your tears… And my tears mix. Your eyelash is worth as much as my heart. Don't speak a word. Don't. Don't speak a single word. Your heart is like a nightingale… Singing to this heart of mine. Uh… Has your heart found peace, Dad? Yes, my boy. It's more than being together again. It's voicing all that was unsaid that makes your heart find peace. What should I do about her? You'll go there with your fiddle and speak your heart to her. You won't keep it inside. If her heart longs for you… …hmm, then she'll come back here. What are you saying? I'm supposed to go back to my gazelle? It's your fault if you don't. Go there while your heart's still on fire. You're here. Yeah, I am. Riza, make it quick. No complications and keep it quiet. All right, Dad. We'll dispose of her later. - We'll say she took her own life. - Right. That makes sense. Were they afraid? You scared them. We both scared them. If I had it my way, you would never be afraid. What happens next? You and I will elope. Aww. Your laugh is lovely. You're making me laugh. It's cursed. It has a demon! - What has a demon? - The barn has a demon. - How could that happen? - How should I know? Follow me. Come on. You need an imam for an exorcism. She needs to be exorcised. Woman, go get the man Kalender. How awful. ♪ I put the hay in and filled it up ♪ ♪ All the power to the bull's dick ♪ Kalender. Hey. Kalender. - Kalender, it's important. Listen. - What is it now? This is important, Kalender! What? Your dad run off again? No, no. It's Sümbül's father. - He's looking for you. - Ah. To inseminate his cow? No, what cow? No! He believes that there's a demon inside Sümbül. Is there a real demon inside her? No, I did it. A true devil you are, huh? You rascal, Piroz. Oh, stop it, Kalender. You're making me blush, I swear. Help me think of something, please. Hmm. There is a way. What is it? We need to kill Sümbül before they do. That's your solution? - To take my gazelle from me? - We'll kill her. We'll act like we killed her. They're gonna think she's dead. And so they won't kill her. Ah, I think you've lost me. I'll give her some medicine. She'll appear dead for a day. Seymen will think she's dead. So, he won't try to kill her. - After that, it's up to you. - Ah. I know what you mean. Hmm. Unless, what about if she dies? She won't. - All right, calm down now. - You're sure it'll work, Kalender? Get out of here. I'm busy. - Hey. Hey, don't do that. - Good boy! Your lips to God's ears. You will die. I-I don't understand. I mean, we'll kill you. Once we kill you, you can't be killed by Seymen. That's the plan. After you're dead, I'll get your body and run away. The plan is to take my dead body? Don't you love me? Yeah. What are you saying? I'm crazy for you. Now, you will die, but in reality, you won't be dead. Oh, all right. In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Gimme that. What ails her? Well, every time we go in there, we hear strange sounds. A demon's possessed Sümbül. I'll pray and chant for the girl. When I'm finished, the demon will be gone. Stay here. Don't move. Don't come inside. I'll check it out first to see if I'm familiar with the demon. Yeah? Pray for her. All of you pray. Pray! It's not a demon, but something else. Well, wait, it is a demon, mixed with something. Satan and a splash of something else. It's deep inside the girl. It's made its habitat there. It's set up a swing inside, swinging back and forth. Swinging back and forth. And it won't come out before dawn. It's grueling. Aww. Oh, my Sümbül, my baby. You never had a sunny day. Now I'll never see your wedding day. I should be dead. It should be me. Dad, look. Oh, my girl. It's pesticide. - She's killed herself. - Good. She got what she deserved. She's paid for her debt on her own then. - Oh, my baby, you deserved more than this. - Oh, shut up, woman. Riza. Listen. Get her buried. I want this over with. Of course, Dad. Ah! You are an answered prayer. This is your home now. Your father has a heart of stone. He was determined to kill you. Consider us all your family now. Piroz is my son, and you're my daughter. Please excuse me. My Dilo's waiting for me. Whoa! Master Piroz is fooling around? What's going on here? Relax, Hatun. I'll tell you. What trouble is this? There isn't any trouble. I found my heart. - I'm begging you, don't tell anyone. - You're joking. You? You came here willingly? - I did. - Hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. If you've come willingly, well then, it's our job to hide you. Girl, what's that? I'll get you something to wear. You shouldn't be walking around in that rag. My poor puppy Piroz has really done it! Oh, right. Where was I? No one will harm you here, okay? Grandpa! Grandpa's not here. Uncle, who's this? What do you mean? Isn't she the girl we asked to marry you? Oh, no. It isn't. - It's her. - No, it's not. - I swear it's her, Uncle. - I said it's not. And that's final. Get out! Jerk. - Uh, yeah. I was saying... - That no one would harm me here. Oh, yeah, yeah. Look. I only wore this once, and then I never wore it after that. I guess it was destined for you, Sümbül. Oh, well. God really has your back, Sümbül. Piroz is a very loving man. I had no idea whether Hogir was in love with me or not. He always told me that he'd marry me. And he did. My father traded me for an ox and a shrill pipe. The ox died soon after, and the shrill pipe was all there was left. My late father loved to play that shrill pipe. He sure did. He really did. For years, he played that pipe. He used to say, "Baby, anywhere I play this shrill pipe, I always think of you." And to this day, it still makes me emotional. Although my father also said that he got a bum deal when that ox died. Girl, it looks great on you. Pretty as a partridge. Partridge, partridge! My love is for you, partridge. You fell for me, partridge. Partridge, partridge! If your partridge is laying eggs, shedding seasonal feathers, old or sick, your partridge shouldn't be allowed to fight in battle. No partridge will be allowed to fight in more than three bouts. Partridge, partridge! Partridge, partridge! My love is for you, partridge. Somehow you felt it too, partridge. Partridge, partridge. - Get in there! - Watch it! What the hell is that? Get 'em. Be free! - Dad, Dad! - What is it now? - Come on! - Damn, what the hell? What do you want? - I was at Grandpa Mirze's tent. - Hey, stop! Quiet, everyone! And? - I saw sitting inside. - Spit it out, son! I went in and saw Uncle Piroz. - And then what? - And? - Remember that girl Piroz wanted to marry? - Yeah? - Her brothers kicked our butts? - Yeah. - I saw that girl. - Whoa! What have you done, Piroz, huh? What is this? What could I do, brother? Leave my heart behind to die? You're gonna get us all into trouble. Meaning? Meaning what's done is done, and whatever happens from now on, it's God Almighty's will that counts. What the hell are you all doing? You're embarrassing the girl. You can't speak here, get out. Move! All of you, move it, get out. Out, out! Hey, what are you staring at? Come on, go! Get out of here, all of you! Keep moving! Damn, Piroz. How could you do this? You went there, and you stole her like she was a chicken. What else could I do? Leave my heart back there? Let's forget all about my heart. I should have left her to die? He could've if he wanted to. But blessed was the hand that reached out that day. - Say mashallah, Hogir. - Hallelujah. She is not going anywhere. I followed my heart, and is there any trouble? Yeah, but, Dad, this really means trouble. No, it doesn't! Nobody can give us any kind of trouble. This will affect no one else. The only ones affected are myself and my son. All right then, Dad. Whatever you say goes. That means we should have ourselves a wedding, right? - Really? - Really. Oh, God! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And, uh, you, what's your father's name again? - Seymen. - Seymen. I remember. You, Sümbül, daughter of Seymen, do you accept Piroz, son of Mirze, as your husband? I do. Whoo-hoo! Mm. All right, all right. - And you, Piroz, son of Mirze... - I do, I do. You do. Then in the name of the Almighty, I now pronounce you husband and wife. - Hogir. - Yeah. Can I recite the Al-Fatiha? - Hatun. - Huh? - Sefure. - What? Is the Al-Fatiha all right? - Yeah, it's a prayer. Why not? - Yeah, it's a prayer, so do it. Um… All right then. The Al-Fatiha! ♪ All praise is for Allah Lord of all worlds ♪ ♪ The Most Compassionate, Most Merciful Master of the Day of Judgment ♪ ♪ You alone we worship And You alone we ask for help ♪ ♪ Guide us along the Straight Path ♪ ♪ The Path of those You have blessed ♪ ♪ Not of those You are displeased with ♪ ♪ Or of those who are astray ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ Piroz. God bless you, kids. - Whoa, look at that. - Aah. This is so pretty. Almost like a pearl. Very pretty, master, very pretty. Look. You will only find one better inside a king's mouth. Hey-ey-ey-ey! You're really good at this, Hogir. - Master, you've become a greater master. - Yeah. Master, tell you what. Now, you're gonna leave here, right? And people in your circle are gonna see this, and since it was a little lady's wish, maybe the missus would like something too. Hey, who's that girl over there? Her? Um, she's Fahri's daughter. Now my sister-in-law. I mean, Piroz's new wife. She not from around here. She looks somehow familiar. No, master. She couldn't be less familiar. She's Fahri's daughter. - Anyway. What do I owe you? - Well, Master. - I'll settle for a ram, two years old. - Fine. I knew it was Sümbül. Maybe you're confused. What do you mean? You think I don't know Sümbül? Thank you, Mürşit. Thank you. I swear I'm not mistaken. I will deal with this. Yeah. You always know best. Yeah, I do. I do. I want to die with you. To burn at your side. I've been through hell. Let me live in your paradise. Come. Come in closer. Will you be mine? Quiet. Don't make a peep. Come into my heart. No words, my dear. Huh? Here I am. I want to die here with you. Dilo. Dilo. Dilo. Dilo! Damn you, children! What have you done with my heart, you damn children? My damn children have destroyed their father's heart! I wasn't going to burn you, dear, but… I'll die. I'll die with you. Dad! Your body is curvy as a vase. And you've dropped into my bed. I see you every day, my love, and year after year, your beauty never fades. - Dad. - What do you want? Don't "Dad" me! It's Grandpa. - What? Huh? - Come look. It's Dilo. - He's burned down Dilo, Dad. - Oh, God, no. - Oh! - Unreal. God damn it. Hurry, go on, run! - Run to your uncle. - Okay. - Gimme my shirt, hurry. - Run, Hogir, run! - Damn it! Will he ever calm down? - Our troubles never seem to cease. He's driving me crazy. - He burned down Dilo, and I'm burned too. - That man has gone mad! I've set up a spot for us, my love, where flowers will grow over us. The sky is so close you can touch it. Where there's a gentle wind that blows by, and the birds will sing us to sleep. Well, Dilo, you're not speaking to me? Ah, did you wanna say something? That's all right, my love. You're my Dilo, the only Dilo, my true love. I told you to make them keep it in their pants. But you couldn't do that for your dad or your brother. Hey, Hatun, I'm begging you, don't do this. I'm trying to see if my father's dead or alive, and you wanna start with this? Let's put your feet like this. Oh, you're so sweet. Are you comfortable in there, Dilo, hmm? He's dead. I'm sure of it. There's no teeth or bones left behind. - Piroz! - He wouldn't burn himself. - Piroz! - What is it? Piroz. Seymen and his men are on their way. How close are they? They've been asking about the tents over in the Zümrüt village. - Oh, no. - Well, isn't that just perfect timing? They won't let us live. You old weasel. Hey, Nedim. - Do you know where his grave is? - I've been there before. - Quick. Run over and see if he's there. - Okay. Maybe he's there. Before we rest, sweetheart, I'll recite some poetry for you, huh? I did open my heart to you, Dilo. Now let the earth fall on my heart. Now let me close my eyes in your eyes. Let my breath be inside of yours. A shroud of grief has spread over this land. My love… My love will last forever. My love for you will last forever. All right, then. Shall we sleep now? - Grandpa! - Oh, the hell with your grandpa! Will you just leave me be so I can go to heaven with my Dilo? - Grandpa. - What? Seymen and his men are headed to the village. Where are they? Hurry, Grandpa, we have to go. Come on! Huh? Ow! Hurry. Dilo, get up. Let's go and save our kid's sweetheart. Let's go. Come on. It's Piroz's fault we're in this trouble. Oh, please, don't start with that too, Sefure. Really? Seymen won't spare any of us. I swear to God. - Dad? No way! - Papa Mirze. - Here he comes. Wow! Hey, son. - Dad! - Master Mirze! - Mirze's here. Come on. Dad! Dad. - Whoa. - Dad, you're unbelievable. Come. Turn around. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Easy, girl. Easy, girl. - Grandpa. I can't believe you're alive! Of course I'm alive, boy. If I'm going to die, Dilo will be with me. All right, come on. There we are. - Dad. - Yeah. Master Seymen's on his way. Yeah, Dad. He has a lot of men. We have to leave. If you'd listen, I have a solution. - Really? - What is it? - And there's no other way. - Just tell me, Dad. - On one condition. - All right, just tell us. You're going to leave me alone here, just me and Dilo. Huh? Dad, what are you talking about? Leave now, before sunrise. You should cross the Kinik Creek. - And? - Yeah. Take the water container. Leave the container on the far bank. You can be down in the Deriz plateau before the sun sets. - I'll stay behind with my Dilo. - It'll never work. Of course it will. I will stall Seymen. Dad. Come on, stop being so stubborn. Take your Dilo, let's make our getaway, okay? No way, my boy, no way. Hey, Dilo and I aren't going anywhere. If Seymen wants to show his face, I'll send you a message from my heart. Come on. Just come with us. Promise me you'll look after the boy. You have a long road ahead of you. A very long road. Now, go. Take them across the water, all right? - Father. - Yeah. You should have this. No, no, I don't want it. I'm okay. Gimme my violin and bow. My precious, huh? There it is. Mirze, Father. Just go and let me stay here. My father's coming for me. Why would you sacrifice yourself for me? Don't say that, dear. You have your whole life ahead of you. More than half of my years are already behind me, my dear. You are the life that gives life to my son. You should get going. Oh, my love, there you go, huh? Shh. Your daughter is my boy's true love, Master Seymen. - Why would she fall for your bastard, huh? - Don't say that, Master Seymen. The heart is not picky, right? Where's your bastard now? He's following his heart. He's with his gazelle. Who knows which mountains they're on. Old man, I swear, I'll shoot you. - Wait, Master Seymen. Wait. - I'll shoot you dead!
