Butyrina Chapter 3: Grey Donkey Eeyore celebrates his birthday and receives 3 useful gifts Once, old grey donkey Eeyore, who was always unlucky, especially on Fridays was standing by the lake and thinking of the strangeness of life Pathetic site. Miserable site. Deplorable Just as I thought... No better from this side And why is this? Wherefore? And what is the conclusion therefrom? If I scratch my head it's no big deal Despite the sawdust I compose... Good morning Eeyore Good morning Winnie-the-Pooh If it is a good morning, which I doubt - How are you? - Not very how, I haven't been feeling how for a while Why? What's the matter? Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can't all, and some of us don't, that's all - Can't all what? - Gaiety. Song-and-dance Here we go round the mulberry bush that sort of thing - Why... what's happened to your tail? - What has happened to it? - It isn't there! - Are you sure? Either a tail is there or it isn't. You can't make a mistake about it - Then what is there? - Nothing Let's have a look I believe you're right You must have left it somewhere No, somebody must have taken it That accounts for a Good Deal It explains Everything. No Wonder. And on such a day - What is today? - Friday... my birthday Today?! But who cares? - Nobody gives a hoot - Birthday?! - Nobody cares - Your birthday?!!! Yes, can't you see? Look at my presents birthday cake, candles, pink sugar, etc. Can't you see them? No Neither can I Joke... Ha ha! But I'm not complaining Don't mind me, Pooh Bear It's bad enough being miserable myself on my birthday but if everybody else is going to be miserable too... Stay there! Don't move, I'll be back! - Hallo Winnie, - Hi Piglet - What are you up to? - I was about to ring, I was passing... Let me do it for you, step aside I have bad news, Piglet Eeyore has lost his tail - Lost what? - His tail and it's his birthday nobody's answering... so, birthday with no tail and no presents - Pooh! - Are they asleep in there?! - But Pooh, it's your own house! Oh! So it is. Well, let's go in I think somewhere in here... where did I... nope no, not that where could have I?... Here! I'll give him a small Pot of honey It'll cheer him up Can I give it too? From both of us? N-no, there's not enough for us both Then I'll give him a balloon I've got the green one left, remember? A balloon is a good idea A balloon will cheer anybody up. Go fetch it quickly! - Yep! The best gift is honey, even a Donkey knows that! Even a teaspoon is good... and a full Pot is even better! Normal things are either there or not, but honey is tricky thing I can't figure it out If honey is there then it no longer is! ...quite... ...would be enough... ...until... ...half-a-pot! Now, where was I going? Ah, yes! Now the Pot is empty and much simpler That's why an empty Pot is more valuable No more sorrow and sadness, good times are here, when you or anybody else except me receives a gift of a Pot with no honey Ples ring if an rnser is reqird. Owl. Plez cnoke if an rnsr is not reqid. Owl. Owl, open up, Bear here! Oh, hallo Winnie-the-Pooh, how's things? Terrible and sad news: Eeyore lost his tail Lost his tail? So? He's saddened, and today is his birthday If the tail went missing some other day, nobody would have noticed, but now... Owl, we must cheer him up somehow Any ideas? Yes, I'll give him a Useful Pot Is this it? Yes, I'd like to... Nice little Pot Somebody was keeping honey in it You can keep anything in it, very useful - But I wanted... - To give it to Eeyore? - Yes but... - To give it from both of us? - No I wanted you to write on it Cheers, Pooh - And that's all? - Why, what else? We should write: A very happy birthday with best wishes Wow! You write that, but also sign: Pooh And you yourself can't? Sure I can... but my spelling is wobbly It's good spelling but it wobbles We can't fit it all on this little pot You know Pooh, just tell it all to him verbally I can't do it verbally! Don't forget I've got sawdust in my head Long words only sadden me All right then Hi-py... bt-ur-ths-dey... Piglet ran as fast as he could to be the first one to give Eeyore a present just as if he had thought of it without being told by anybody thinking how pleased Eeyore would be, he didn't look where he was going Funny... I wonder what that bang was I couldn't have alone made such a noise And where's my balloon? And what's that small piece of damp rag? Oh! Dear! Oh dear! There, listen: Ve-wy... ha-py Hapy bur... birth... Owl, where did you get it? What? Oh that. Handsome bell-rope, isn't it? But don't interrupt It reminds me of something birth-day I've seen it somewhere but can't remember where In the forest It was hanging over a bush - A bush? - Yes, why? - Nothing, go on Now, bir-thedey... best wy... wi... - What did you say? - Wishes - You were talking about a bush. - Yes I was walking in the forest and suddenly I see a hanging bell-rope - On a bush? - Yes, on a bush... - A bush of thistle - Bless you! And then? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me - I didn't sneeze - You did, Owl, but sorry I interrupted Excuse me, Pooh, but I didn't sneeze You can't sneeze without knowing it Well, you can't know it without someone sneezing - And I'm telling you - You were telling about the rope Yes, fine, so the bell-rope I thought at first somebody lived there so I rang it, and nothing happffened There, you sneezed again, bless you - I rang anew - Bless you. And then? - And anew - Bless you then I rang it again very loudly, and... and... What happened? It came off in my hand Came off... I see and as nobody seemed to... atchoo! ...to want it, I took it home - Owl, somebody did want it - Who wanted it? My friend Eeyore. He was fond of it. Attached to it. If you offer him this rope as a birthday gift he'll be very happy. Bless you. - Good morning Eeyore - Good morning Little Piglet If it is a good morning, which I doubt. Not that it matters Happy birthday! Just say that again - Hap... - Wait a moment, so that I hear better - Happy birthday! - Whose, mine? - Yes - My birthday?! - I brought you... a present A gift for me?! I am having a real birthday then! - Yes, but... - Thank you, Piglet you are a real friend... unlike some - And what is the present? - A balloon Balloon? One of those big pretty things Yes, but I was running... - They blow them up... - I wanted to bring it quickly - and I fell - how unlucky! You didn't hurt yourself? I didn't but... but I burst the balloon! My balloon?? Yes, here it is Happy birthday Is this it, my present? Thank you, Piglet Sorry to ask, but what colour was it when it... when it was a balloon? Green My favourite colour How big was it? About as big as me About as big as you - my favourite size Happy birthday, many happy returns of the day, Pooh! Thank you, Pooh, I'm having them I've brought you a little present I already got a little one... It's a Very Useful gift. You can put in it... whatever you want! Why! I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot! N-no, Balloons can't fit into such Pots They are much too big Other balloons wouldn't fit, but mine will. Look, Piglet! It does! It goes in! And it comes out! Comes out great! Comes out, goes in! I'm glad I gave you such a Useful Pot into which fits such a Suitable Balloon - Nice to give a friend for his birthday a Pot! - A balloon! - And I - And I - And I'm of that opinion! Happy birthday, Eeyore! I heard it is your birthday, isn't it? Yes, a real birthday, so many gifts! Right. Dear Eeyore! On this happy day I wish to offer you - without indemnity... - what?! - be quiet, Pooh! I only wanted to know without what? - without indemnity, meaning for free - oh, for free, got it ...offer you without indemnity a modest but very useful gift this little rope! - Pooh, come here, I think it is it! - You could hang it over your door... - Could you try it on for me please - What's going on, it's my bell-rope! - Is it IT? - It is. My tail?! - What's going on? - My very own tail?! Of course! Hurray! The tail is found! The Owl found the tail! What tail is that? The tail? What? You mean I offered... the tail?! How nice, what a coincidence a balloon fits a pot, and tail fits the birthday - And I - And I - And I'm of that opinion! Nice giving gifts and joy to a friend - And I - And I - And I'm of that opinion! - And I - And I - And I'm of that opinion! The End
