(lively music) (birds cawing) (suspenseful music) (birds crowing) (lively music) - [Margaret] Carl, come in now, do you hear me? Carl. Come on now. Carl! - You know, of course, we're gonna be late for the boat. - Not if I can help it. Carl! (Carl grunting) There, you see? That's what you get for running round out here when I told you not to. Let me see. (energetic music) What are we gonna do with you? Here, wrap this around it. Come on now. Come on. (lively orchestral music) Carl. (boat horn hoots) - It's the boat! - Carl, come on! (engines rumbling) Carl, Mary and I have to go to the bank now. I want you to sit right here and wait for us to to be done, understand? All right? (Carl grunts) (wheel rattling) - Let go, give me my wheel! - There, that oughta be enough, wouldn't you think? - The groceries arrived last week. - I know that. Now what's the matter? - Nothing. - Then why the long look on your face? - I said it was nothing. - I'm not gonna take you with me next time. (Mary scoffs) - What are you doing here? I've never seen you here before. - Yeah, he's the half-wit brother of the Lennox sisters, the ones that live on Handley Island. - Oh, yeah. (tall man laughs) - You want a drink? Go on, it won't hurt ya. (both laughing) (Carl grunts) - Make you feel good. Come on. - Margaret, we haven't see you two in over a year. - We don't get into town too often. - Must be very lonesome in that house all by yourselves. - We're used to it. - How's Carl? - The same. How's Oscar? - The same. It's a good thing you didn't get married. - Maybe. (men mumbling) (Carl grunting) (men laughing) (dramatic orchestral music) (dog barks) - Oh no! - You should've stayed here with him. - That's right, blame me. - Are you looking for him? - Our brother, yes. Do you know where he went? - Yeah, they went that way with two guys. - Two men? - Yeah, you better hurry, they ain't no good. (dramatic orchestral music) - Carl! - Carl! Carl! (Carl grunts) - Carl! - Margaret! Margaret! - Carl! Carl! - [Carl] Margaret! Margaret! - Oh, my god, there he is! (Carl whimpering) (birds cawing) (suspenseful music) (Carl grunts) I think his arm is broken. (Regina humming) - Ouch. - [James] What's the matter? - Burned myself. - Dummy. Need help? - You bring this tray, I'll take the rest. What time do you have to be at work today? - Don't, told you yesterday, day off. - You mean I'm stuck with you all day? - Lucky lady. (Regina chuckles) - Your breakfast'll get cold. - What do you want, a cold breakfast or cold me? - Neither, sit. - Have all day. - Lech. (gentle knocking) Expecting someone? - You? Couldn't be mother. - God, I hope not, not at this hour now. - Now, now, be nice. - Smith, James Smith? - Yes. - Special delivery letter. - Where from? - New York. Sign here. - Here. (dog barking) Wait a minute, please. (birds chirping) (gentle music) Here you are. - Thank you. (door screeches) - Who's it from? From Samuel Schaeffer. - Your lawyer? What's he want? - He wants us in New York on April 10th. - What for? - It doesn't say. It says it's imperative that we be there. - We? What does it have to do with me? - He wants us both. - I just can't up and leave whenever I want to. I have a law practice to attend to, such as it is. - You could get your friend Robert to handle things for a few days. You always say what a good lawyer he is. - The way things have been going here in Boston this certainly wouldn't be much for him to handle. - You only started practice eight months ago. Give yourself time. - Well, you put up with a lot being married to me. I bet you thought it was going to be easy being married to a lawyer. - You don't hear me complaining, do you? - What are we gonna do for money? - Your mother? - (scoffs) Oh, sure. That's all we need another favor from her. - I can put up with it if you can. - We never had a honeymoon. - That's right. - Things are slow right now. - We could stay at Louise's. - You're a wench, you know that? - I know, I know. - Ito, where's Ms. Cunningham? - She be down soon. - Well, you better get her drink ready soon. - Yes, miss. - I don't think it's a good idea my going along. I really should stay with Sylvia. - Robert, you can't. The lawyer said in his letter he wants us both there. Oh, Ito we can manage Sylvia. He's done so for the past month he can manage another week. - You know how she gets. - Can't imagine how happy I'll be when she goes back to New York. - She had no one else. - Doesn't she have any friends? - She used to have many. She's alienated the all. I'm really all that's left. - If only she didn't drink so much. And that mouth on her. - Here she comes. - I'm hungry. - You should be, you haven't eaten since yesterday. - Oh, isn't she the little nurse? You keeping count, honey? - [to, another drink. - I think you've had enough. - Dinner is served. (light orchestral music) - 1 hope you and Ito will be all right while Jennifer and I are in New York. (Sylvia laughs) - Ito loves me, don't you, Ito? Never seen one like me before, have ya? (laughs) - [Robert] Sylvia, how's your ankle? - Stupid, that's what it was, stupid. First time I fell off the apron. The apron, Jennifer, is the front of the stage. - [Jennifer] Yes, I know. - I wasn't drunk. I don't care what those bastards say. - [Robert] Sylvia, eat. (Sylvia blows raspberries) - Jennifer, I'm gonna take you to my dressmaker. (laughs) Maybe that way you won't look so much like a plucked chicken. Remember when I starred in that play with George Ellis? (light orchestral music) Bobby. (Sylvia gasps) - He won't eat, why not? - He won't let me come near him. - Well, at least his arm's not broken. Any normal person would have died in such a fall. - He's too stupid to get hurt. What kind of person would do something like that? - We can't take him with us when we go into town. - Do you think it's safe to leave him here alone? - I don't know. - Let's see if we can get him to eat something (suspenseful orchestral music) - Now, let me handle this. Shh, I wish to God he'd let us take him back upstairs, at least 'til his arm's better. - You'll never get him upstairs. - Shh! Carl. It's me, Margaret. (Carl grunts) Come on, now. Look what I've got. Mm, good. Food good. It's good. Mm. Good. Want some? (gentle music) (Carl grunting) Here, let me hold it for you. There. Oh, that's good. (Carl grunting) That hurts, doesn't it? I know, I know. You know, his arm's gonna be all right. It's amazing. - Let me see. (Carl grunts) (Mary screams) He bit me! - Susan, I think I'll put my sister with Gina in this room. That's my youngest sister, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. - Mr. and Mrs. Smith. - And I'll put sister, Jennifer and her husband, in a guest room next to the bathroom, that's Mr. and Mrs. Burke. - Mr. and Mrs. Burke. - And Susan, make sure that you change the linens every day while they're here, and don't come up to make the beds until afternoon in case they want to sleep in. - [Susan] Yes, ma'am. - [Charlotte] Mother, I wish you'd help me pack. I don't know what to take with me. - Susan, go down to the kitchen and get a pencil and paper and tell your mother to come upstairs, I want to give her the menu for the next two weeks. - Oh, she's gone out. - Out where? - 1 don't ask. (phone ringing) - Oh, she might've gone shopping. Well, if only we get through these next two days I'll be happy. They just as well could have stayed in a hotel. - Mother. - Charlotte, in a minute. You can't always be first. - The sink is stopped up in the laundry room again. - That's all we need. We'll tell you mother I'll get it from her first thing in the morning. - Yes, ma'am. - Now, what's wrong? - You didn't have to say that in front of Susan. - Say what? - What you said. - You're spoiled rotten, you know that? - You keep reminding me. - Charlotte you've changed in the last year. - How? - You're getting stuck up. - What do you mean? - Well, well like just now with Susan, you acted superior to her. You know Susan and her mother work for us because they have to. They don't have everything they want the way you do. If you don't watch yourself very carefully when you growing up, you become very ignorant of other people's feelings. And the first thing you know you turn into a not very nice person. - I'm sorry, mother. - The reason I'm so hard on you, honey, is because I want so much more from you than just another young lady. You see, I won't always be here to take care of you. (light airy music) (rapid knocking) - Regina. Didn't you hear me knock? - No. - What's the matter? - It's cold in here. - It's not. What's wrong? - Ever since I was a little girl, I've had feelings, premonitions about things. I've been sitting here thinking about going to New York. Something in the back of my mind tells me not to. - We can’t stop now. We borrowed the money, the plans are made. Louise and John are expecting us. - I don't like it, I'm frightened. Hold me. - Where's Billy? - I moved his pet rabbit from under the back porch to the old shed. - But he wants his rabbit with him in the cellar. - You spoil him too much. - Well, how am I going to handle him without it? - Get him his rabbit. (light music) - Mind if I disturb you? - You never disturb me. - Susan and her mother have gone out. And with Charlotte at your mother's the house is just too empty. - What time do they arrive tomorrow? Regina and James at about 7:30, and Jennifer and her husband at about eight. - How come we're not meeting them? - Jennifer's idea. She felt that since they were both arriving at Grand Central, and only a half an hour apart, it would be foolish to meet them. They know the way. - You mean we'll have a little time to ourselves in the morning? - More or less. Everything's ready. You know, I liked your idea of you three men going your way and we three girls going ours. - So I thought I'd take them to Lou Chow's for lunch. Maybe a little sightseeing afterwards. - And I thought that I'd take Jennifer and Gina to that little restaurant I told you. - I hope they serve drinks. - Wouldn't go there if they didn't. With all the talk we're gonna have to catch up on I'm gonna need them. - Aren't you glad you married me? - No, not really. - What? You little. (Louise squeals) Take that back now. - John! Oh, John! (both laughing) (light orchestral music) - Now, Cairl, now look, take the wood from here. You see, like this. And then you carry it over here and you put it here in the basket. Okay? Now you do it. Go ahead. (light music) (wood rattles) No, no. Don't you ever learn anything? Nevermind. Go on in and try to help Mary. I'll do this. (light orchestral music) (sisters chattering) - Oh, this is just the loveliest little two-room I found when it was rainy one Thursday. They had the greatest luncheon. (laughs) - [Host] Good afternoon, may I help you? - Yes, I called before, three, Mrs. Halverson. - Yes, Mrs. Halverson, come in. (sisters chattering) Would you care for some drinks? - I'd like one sherry, please. - Same for me. - And I'll have some white wine. I hope you two are hungry. - Starved. - Slept like a log last night, Louise. (chair rattles) (Jennifer mutters) - You know we really could've stayed at a hotel. - Don't be silly, I love having the two of you with me. We haven't seen each other for so long. - I'll be back with your order. - Jimmy and Robert said something about going to the Museum of Natural History today. - Oh, is that where they went? - Robert wants to do lots of sightseeing. - John was going to meet them on 14th Street and take them to Lou Chow's for dinner. - Oh, nice. (women chattering) - Sherry. - Oh, here. - Sherry. (sisters chattering) And white wine. - Oh, that's mine, thank you. - May I take your orders? - [Jennifer] I'll have the chicken, a salad, maybe coffee now, please. - I'd like to salmon steak and also salad. - And I'll have the special, please. Now, here's to it. - Why did Samuel Schaeffer want the men at the reading of papa's will? - He wouldn't say, he just said that he can't read the will without our husbands being there. - Sounds it sounds a bit crazy to me, but then papa always was a little nuts. - [Regina] The whole family is. - Oh, family is speak for yourself, Regina. - [Jennifer] What time tomorrow? Three o'clock at Schaeffer's office. We'll leave on the six o'clock train for upstate, and then we'll make both connections at 8:30, and we should be on Handley Island by nine. That's the schedule Mr. Schaeffer has worked out for us. - Why such a precise schedule? - That's the way father wanted it. He was very definite about all the arrangements. - I wish we'd known him. - [Regina] It would have been nice. - From what lawyer Schaeffer says it's probably better we didn't. - What do you mean? - Excuse me, which dressing would you like on your salad? - Oh, the house dressing'll be fine, thank you. - Thank you. - Father was a very strange man. A loner. According to Mr. Schaeffer even mother didn't understand him. - Well, I only saw him twice when I was a child. - I don't remember him at all. - I only remember seeing father once, and then I vaguely remember he and mother shouting at each other. I think, I don't know. - Tomorrow will be very interesting. - But why do we have to go to the island for the reading of the will? Why can't we just have it done at Mr. Shaeffer's office? - Father was very definite about that. He was definite about all the arrangements. Do you know that we had to wait for you and James to be married for at least two years before Mr. Schaeffer could even open the first envelope with his instructions? - That just sent a chill down my spine. - Well then let's change the subject. Louise, how's Charlotte? - She's fine. She seven now. She's staying with my mother-in-law until we come back from Handley Island. I would've thought you and Robert would have had scads of children by now. - Robert doesn't want to have any children. I guess he's got a point. We're both alike in that respect, we're too selfish to have children. - Where's papa buried? - What made you think of that? - [Regina] I don't know. - He's buried a few blocks from here in a seaman cemetery. He insisted on it. Seeing as he so much time at sea and traveling that he wanted to be buried with fellow travelers, as he put it. - [Regina] Weird. - Well let's go there after lunch, I'd like to see his grave. - You know, Jennifer, it's strange, but so would I. - Mary! Did you finish upstairs? - No, I haven't. - Well, why not? - I've only got to hands. Well I need some help in the kitchen. That is, if you find the time to help in the kitchen. (Mary sobs) Look, I'm not going to put up with that. It's hard enough around here without you starting in. - What do you want from me? - Will I be glad when these four days are over. (Mary sobbing loudly) (door slams) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Handley, John Handley, wasn't a seaman. That's all we got buried here, you know? - The grave was unmarked. - You sure you got the right place? - You know, there's another one, Blazing Star Cemetery. - No, this is the place. It would've been over 20 years since he was buried. - I've been here 32 years, started when I was a kid, my father used to be the caretaker and his father before him. - It's an unmarked grave, he was shipped here from South America. - Yeah, I remember. The financier or something like that? You know, they shipped him in here standing up. He arrived packed in orchids. That body was packed in so tight that it took two of us with crowbars to get him out. - Where's the grave? - Anyone that were strangers, not bonafide seamen, was put over here. There he is. - This is it? - Yep, not much to it. - We'll plant some shrubs. - Can't. - Why not? - If I remember correct he didn't want anything to mark his final resting place. Guess that were her wishes too. - [Regina] Her wishes? - Your mother, I guess. The woman that's standing there with him, they're locked together, you know? You all right? (suspenseful orchestral music) (Carl grunting) - Stop it! Stop it. (hand thudding) Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it! (light music) (sisters chattering) (Louise knocks) - Baba Musatanda, Louise, are you out of your mind? Since when do you need an advisor? - He isn't just that. He teaches me other things like relaxation, mind control, emotional economy. - Emotional economy? (giggles) That's funny. - No, listen, he's a very serious teacher. You'll see that when you meet him. - And this Baba can see into the future? - Well he has predicted things that have come true. - Well, I've never been to a fortune teller before, this should prove very interesting. - I know what you're both thing, but don't be too negative. It's one of those bad vibrations and Baba can sense them right away. - Yes? - We're here to see Baba. - Oh, Baba is meditating. He expects you, come in. Baba will be with you in a moment, please remove your shoes. Thank you. - Remove our shoes? She's joking. - No, he feels better in natural surroundings, as he puts it. And he feels that the elements can circulate better if our hands and feet are uncovered. - [Regina] Well, all right. - I think he's ready for us. - 1 hope I don't begin to laugh. (laughs) - Ah, Mrs. Halverson. - Baba, it was so gracious of you to receive us on such short notice. I'd like you to meet my sister, Jennifer. Kiss it! And my sister, Regina. (Regina laughs) - This ring was the one the ring of the great teacher. He gave it to me on his death bed. It has powers that transcend this life. I would not laugh if I were you. - I'm sorry. I had some wine with lunch and it made me a little silly. - You have powers to see. You should not be skeptical. You have premonitions, like me. - How'd you guess? - Baba does not guess. Baba knows. - Louise told you. - No. Eena! Would you all please be seated? Eena, some drinks for our guests. Two sherries for these two ladies, and Mrs. Halverson will have a white wine. No, Mrs. Halverson did not tell me that is what you drink, I just know. Now, ask. - I don't mean to appear rude, but I was just curious. - [Baba] Curious? About my name? - Why yes. - My mother was Hungarian, a gypsy. Baba was her pet name, hence a Bubba. And my father was Himalayan, hence Musatanda. You see, you Americans are not the only ones with mixed blood. Actually, I never knew my father. But to be nearer to the truth, I'm a bastard. Next question. - Baba, the three of us are going to take a trip. Short trip. Will it be pleasant for the three of us? - For two of you. - Two of us? - One will not return. - Why not? Baba, why won't you me? - [Eena] Sherry? (Eena shouting) - Currents are not good. Eena is disturbed. (Eena singing) - Should we go? - Yes, that's a good idea. - No, no! No! - What are you- (Eena screams) (upbeat hypnotic music) - Go away! Death is not wanted here! Go away! Go away! Go away! (light orchestral music) (waves lapping) - Did you feed Carl? - He eats when he wants to. - This place used to be so beautiful. Remember? - That was a long time ago. - Not that long ago. - Wouldn't it be nice to get away for a little while? - Where? - Any place but here. - We have a little money saved up. - Do you think that we'll get something from the settlement of the estate? - Of course we will. - Do you know how many years we've been on this island? - Don't think about it. It's funny running into Vera at the bank like that. - She looks well for her age. - We would too if we had her money. - Why didn't you get married when you had the chance? - Oscar? A lot of reasons. You and Carl to look after. - We could've managed. - I did the right thing. (light orchestral music) - Thank you. - Mrs. Carter called said, she'd be a half hour late. - Mrs. Carter is always late. - Alice, tomorrow at three for the reading of the Handley will I want absolutely no interruptions. - Do you think you'll be through by four? - Why? - You have an appointment with Mr. Rogers at four. - [Samuel] Couldn't. - It's right here in your appointment book. - I made that. - Certainly did. - Well change Mr. Rogers to another day. - All right. - And Alice, you better get out all the books and papers pertaining to Mr. Handley. - Now? - I'm going to have to make some slight financial adjustment. After all these years of working with Mr. Handley's money, the office is going to miss it. - Everything has to end sometime or another. - I just didn't think it would end so soon. - What? - Nothing. (gentle orchestral music) - Good boy, bunny. Soft bunny. (Carl shouts) - Now, before we begin, there are a few things I must tell you. First of all, this will is highly irregular though legal. Your father was a very strange and mysterious man. None of you, three girls really knew your father. His vast holdings in South America demanded every moment of his time, thereby depriving you with any attention. He returned to Handley Island only about seven times. Out of those seven visits, three children were conceived. You, Jennifer, you, Louise, and you, Regina. And in that order, on his last visit, many years ago, he demanded my late father's presence at Handley Island. My father arrived by the boat and went directly to his bedside. He was a very untrusting man. He'd already had these papers drawn up by his lawyers in South America. All he wanted of my father was his signature to attest to the legality of his sanity. To this day. I do not know what is in these papers. Well, my dears, this is it. (paper rustles) "My dearest darlings, "By now I presume you are all happily married. "I never was. "You loved your mother, I never did. "She was a good mother, but a terrible wife. "She was possessive, selfish and demanding. "These statements I make now against her "should not be allowed to hurt your feelings toward her. "They are only meant to give you insight "into the following provisions. "One, each of you, and your husband, "shall reside at Handley House in sexual harmony "for a period of three days. "Two, the morning of the third day "envelope marked with the B "in the possession of my lawyer will be opened, "and the bequest shall be dispersed. "Three, the large old trunk in the attic of the main hall, "which will have been brought down by this time, "shall be opened. "Four, in case any unforeseen events occur, "the eldest heir shall redistribute my bequests "according to her wishes." - Well. - Never knew they had no love for each other. - You know, mother never'd let us know. - No one knew. - The whole thing frightens me. I don't like it. - Neither do I. - There's no other way? We can't have the will read right here? - These are his wishes. I can't change the stipulation. I would advise you to carry out his will to the letter. That is a great deal of money at stake. - Why would he include us, the husband's in as will? - According to my late father, who knew him quite well, he felt that any man who could put up with her children was as much entitled to the money as any of his heirs. - That's the reason Regina and I had to be married for two years before the will could be read. - [Samuel] Precisely. - How he must've hated her. If only he'd known some of the love that his daughters have had, and given. - That's one of the nicest thing you've ever said. - I don't wanna go. - We have no choice. - No! - Do you know it's 4:15 already? - I think we'd better wrap things up. You have to take the six o'clock train upstate to connect with the 8:30 boat. You should arrive a little about nine o'clock on Handley Island. - Glad you told us to bring our luggage with us, or we never would've made it. - This is it. Darling, after all these years it'll be worth the waiting. Know how hard it's been financially, on you and James lately. - Everything will be all right, you'll see. - I wish I felt the way you do. - You will. - Times-a-wasting. - I'll call a taxi. - The best of luck to everyone. - We won't be be needing it, Mr. Schaeffer. Everything's going to be just fine. - The train's three minutes late. - Oh, what would you do without your watch? - You know, I hope Ito makes sure Sylvia doesn't drink too much. - I wonder whether I shouldn't have given him a little more money. - I forgot my shoes! - You've got them on. - No, the new ones I bought for the trip. - Just forget them. - Here it comes. (train whistle blows) - 1 hope I don't get train sick. - James, get us a porter, I'll help to relay with Robert. All right, everybody? - Yes. - Yes. - [James] Porter! (train whistle hoots) (sisters chattering) (suspenseful orchestral music) (luggage thuds) - Carl! (Carl grunts) Carl! Carl, stop it! (light orchestral music) - [Carl] Bunny? (luggage thuds) (Carl grunts) (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (Carl whimpering) - Shh. (light orchestral music) - Could you help me with this please? - Why we had a dress down here is beyond me. - Well, Margaret said the rooms aren't ready yet. - Well, I don't know why that should be, according to lawyer Schaeffer they knew we were coming two weeks ago. - Where's your Regina? - She's going through her things in the storage room. She thinks she lost an earring. - It's cold in here. - It's always cold here. That's what I remember as a child. - It seems strange being here again, doesn't it? - Oh, I always hated this place. Too bad papa never finished the main building. We went all over the world to furbish it. - It's funny how he never finished with all the electricity. Did you see the light fixtures and the outlet? He never put the generator and to make everything work. - Oh, there are so many things that I've buried in my head. Did you see that portrait of mom in the dining room? - Not very flattering. - Oh, you remember when we were young and we went to that the boarding school? (both laugh) - (indistinct) They're all awful. - At least we have each other. - We'll always have each other. - Oh, is that a threat? - You know though, Margaret and Mary haven't had a very easy time of it. - You mean Carl? - Not just that but the time they spent catering to mom all those years. - Why do you think she never spent much time with us? - I don't know. I don't think we'll ever completely know. - Well, we haven't come out too badly. Have we, considering? - Maybe we were lucky. We were never spoiled, and we always had to make our own decisions, and we never had anyone to tell us what to do. - Maybe. Oh, I like John. - He's nice, isn't he? I like Robert too. - Oh, we're getting so sentimental. - No, just closer. We haven't been able to the last few years. I mean, you're living in Philadelphia and all. - You are happy now, aren't you? - As happy as I can expect to be. - They must have really hated each other. - You mean mother and father? - Well, why didn't they just divorce? They might as well have. Each one of them went their separate way. - He drank a lot. - Well, that's what we were told. I wonder what was the truth and what wasn't. - Don't you believe what she told us? - Well, all we heard was her side. There are two sides to every story. - True. Maybe some good will come of this. - The money, Shaeffer said there's going to be a lot of it. - Not just that. Renewing old ties. - Oh, the fire's so nice, isn't it? - Mm-hm. (light orchestral music) - I know Carl's a little simple minded. The only thing he understands is the slap now and then. - Short attention span. - Most of my patients are like that. - Oh, stop that. You do very well by your patients. Must be interesting listening to other people's secrets. - Mostly petty problems. They let them mount up, keeping them to themselves, and then one day they cause mental stress. - Fascinating field. Wish I was in something besides hardware. - If you were in something else, you'd want something else. Just what we were talking about, short attention span. (all laugh) - Excuse me. But it's getting very late now, and Mary and I have most of your things up in your room, so if you all don't mind, I'd like to show you. - Of course, you must be very tired. - The supper was excellent. - [Louise] Wasn't it though? - [John] Shall we all go? - This way. - That turkey was delicious. (all chattering) - Don't you find it difficult living here year round? - You get used to it. You can get used to anything. - We put you all up on the second floor. (all chattering) Mary and Carl and I are up on the third floor. (Carl grunting) (Carl shouting) - Mary! (Carl shouting) - Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Shh, his teddy. - His teddy bear? - Well get him his teddy. - [ will. Carl. (Carl sobbing) Carl. Teddy. Teddy. - Teddy? - Yes, teddy. Come get teddy, Carl. Come on. Shh. - He is not violent, is he? - No, not really. Mr. and Mrs. Burke. - [Jennifer] Robert. - This room is yours. - Mr. and Mrs. Halverson, this is your room. - Thank you. - And Mr. and Mrs. Smith, this way. I'm afraid your room's all the way down the end of the hall. Here it is over here. There you are. - Thank you. - If you need anything, just call. I leave my door open. (light orchestral music) (Margaret knocks) If there's anything you'd like just call. - If you don't mind I would like a little tea before I retired. Old habits are hard to change. - Of course. - Up here. (suspenseful orchestral music) (Jennifer singing) - Oh, I feel so much better now. - I wish you would have reminded me before we left New York. I could have gotten something for you at the druggist. Completely forgotten about you're getting motion sickness. - It wouldn't have been so bad if the sea had been a little calmer. - Three days. No phones, no communication to the mainland. I don't think I've ever been so cut off. - Oh no. We're gonna have that second honeymoon that we've never had. (swelling orchestral music) Oh. I love you. How long has it been since I've told you that? - Not for at least three minutes. (Jennifer laughs) (dramatic music) - What's wrong? - Someone's at the door. - What do you mean? - The doorknob turned. (suspenseful orchestral music) (clock ticking) (suspenseful orchestral music) There's nothing there. - Three days? Well, I'll say one thing, those two certainly know how to cook. - That's all you think about is your stomach. - Charlotte got off all right? - Mm-hmm, she loves your mother. Your mother spoils her rotten. She gives her anything she wants. - Can't blame her. Charlotte's the only granddaughter she has. - How did you like Margaret and Mary? - They were a real pair. That's their brother? - I think he was brain-damaged at birth. You know, I'd almost completely forgotten all about the three of them. - I thought you grow up together. - No, mother always kept us apart. We girls were always away at boarding school, or being taken on vacation, being sent away someplace. I don't wanna talk about it. Brings back unpleasant memories. - Right. (swelling orchestral music) - Shame! (clock ticking) - Carl? (playful orchestral music) Carl. Carl. Carl. (door squeaks) Carl? Here's teddy. (water pattering) Carl. Come get teddy. (suspenseful orchestral music) Carl. (hands rubbing) - It's cold in here. - It's always cold on this island. The only thing I ever remember about it. - You've been in a mood ever since we left from New York. (light knocking) Who is it? - It's me, Robert. I thought you might like to read the book I was telling you about. - Excuse me. I thought another lamp might come in handy. - [James] Oh, that for us? - If you need it. - It is a little dark in here. Here I'll take that. - I'll turn down the bed. - [Robert] I think you'll find it interesting. (Regina screams) (dramatic music) - [James] Robert, help me, quick. Get her out! Get out! (men shouting) (feet stomping) - Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit (screams). - [James] Robert, here. - Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit. What the hell does that mean? Who could have done it? - I don't know but I'm frightened. John, I can't stay in bed. (suspenseful orchestral music) John, you know it's very strange, but Regina had a dream about something like this the other night. - What do you mean? - Well, it was a couple of nights ago, and she dreamt there was blood in her bed. - Oh, come on now. - No, it's true. She dreamt she was in a strange room, and when she went to pull back the covers, there was blood all over the bed. - I don't know what to say. - Regina has a sixth sense about these things. I remember the night before mama died, it was very late, and Regina was staying with me, and it was the middle of the night. She woke up screaming. I ran to a bedside she was cold with sweat. And she said, "Mama's dead." - Darling, that dead animal was someone's idea of a cruel joke. - It wasn't a joke. It reeked of death. - Could have been anyone of them. - It's funny, after all these years of being close to them, I don't feel close to them anymore. - Well, it's only natural. You haven't seen either one of them in a long time. - No. It isn't that. It's this house, it's this whole thing about the will. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Come here and sit down. - [Regina] I can't. I can't relax. - Everything's going to be all right. - [Regina] You think so? - What do you mean? - This house and property are worth a great deal of money. The rest of his holdings, God only knows how much. - [James] we'll get our share. - I want more than share. - That's selfish. - No, it isn't. I'm the youngest, I need it more than they do. I always got the short end of everything. Even momma didn't have time for me. You heard what Samuel Schaeffer said, he had no love for her. She, in turn, got more and more bitter towards us. She got rid of us whenever she could. - I've never seen her like this before. - I had to do without even while you were in law school. - You don't resent me for that? (Regina sobs) No, don't, don't. Come to bed. I don't want you to think anymore. (Regina sobbing) Shh. (Regina sobbing) That's all right, Regina. (Regina sobbing) (James whispering) (suspenseful orchestral music) - What is it? - Shh! (suspenseful orchestral music) (Regina gasps) You stay here, I'll be right back. - Don't leave me. - Lock the door. (suspenseful orchestral music) (wood creaking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (clock ticking) (dramatic music) John. What are you doing up? - Did you see anyone? - No, I just came out. I heard someone upstairs and I came out. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. Dammit, man, there's an X on door painted in blood. Don't go up. I don't want Regina upset anymore than she already is. - I thought I saw something. - What? - I thought I saw a shadow coming down the stairs just before you came down. - I think we better check down there. - Good idea. (suspenseful orchestral music) - I could use a drink. - So could I. - Sherry? - No, thanks. - Oh, that's right, you drink brandy. - My nerves are shot, I'll have another one. - Cheers. Sorry. How's Louise? - She's asleep. At least she was dozing when I left. It's not very funny about that dead rabbit. - I don't think it was meant to be. - First the rabbit, then the blood on your door. Why? It doesn't make sense. - I think that Carl is sicker or smarter than we think. - [John] Wasn't Carl. - Who do you think did it? - I don't know. But I won't be able to sleep tonight until I check. - Want help? I'll check the kitchen in the back porch. - Good idea. (suspenseful orchestral music) I'll check the front door and make sure it's locked. - Right. (suspenseful orchestral music) (clock ticking) (John thuds) (clock chimes) (door squeaks) (dramatic music) (clock chiming) (suspenseful orchestral music) - John. John. (suspenseful orchestral music) (door screeches) John. (water dripping) John. (suspenseful orchestral music) Onh, it's you. What are you doing up? (light thudding) - James, is that you? James! Answer me! Who's out there (man grunting) (Regina gasping) (suspenseful orchestral music) James. (suspenseful orchestral music) (Regina screams) (dramatic orchestral music) - I've never heard of such a thing. Breakfast at noon. - You could hardly expect them to eat before now after what happened last night. - Well, it just throws the whole day. - Oh for God's sake, Mary, will you stop it? You've been going on like this all morning. None of our days will be the same again until this whole thing is over. - And to think our lives is to revolve around those girls. - And now they seem to be in the way? - I didn't say that. - No, but I did, and I mean it, I never loved those three the way you used to. There, I've said it, after all these years I finally said it. - I never knew you felt that way. - Well, the table's set. We certainly can't wait for them any longer. When did Carl kill Billy? - Yesterday. When they arrived Carl must've forgotten that he had tied Billy down on the beach. As we were coming to the house he remembered and went to untie him. I turned, I saw what had happened, and I went after him. I took Billy and hid him under my cloak. After you were inside I buried him. Someone must've dug him up. - We mustn't get him any more pets. - We can't watch him all the time. - We have to, you know know how he gets. - He hasn't done anything like that in years. - We should've committed him years ago. - You can't send your own brother to an asylum. - If only he didn't get so violent. You tied him up last night? - Yes. He was tied up all night. - You're sure? - Yes! When I went to bed he was there, and when I got up this morning he was still there. - Thank God it wasn't him. - Can you convince them of that? Here they come. (light music) - I don't think we'll be able to eat anything. - Well there must be some way to get off this island. - Only two more days then everything'll be all right. - We checked the glasses and decanter and we found no trace of drugs. - Oh, but it had to be, there was no other way you would have gone off like that. - Nothing at all, nothing? - Why would anyone want to kill James? It doesn't make any sense. - Haven't you better step up there with Regina? - Louise is up there with her now, but she doesn't want us, she told us to leave. - [Robert] Maybe that's best. - No one could've lifted him and a hung by the neck like that unless they had a great deal of strength. - Oh, I don't wanna hear anymore. Really, you two, can't you see how upset I am? - Robert, Mary, Mr. Burke and I want to talk with you. - Where was Carl last night? - He was with us. We know where he was all night. - Wasn't Carl, believe us, it wasn't Carl. - You swear to that? - Yes. (Carl grunting) (wood thuds) - Wood, see? - If you'll excuse me, I have to take this up to Mrs. Smith. Come on. - Where'd you put the body? - Where you suggested, in the old shed behind the house. - We covered it over with some old sail-cloth. (light music) (clock ticking) - Carl, now I want you to take this. Take it. Upstairs to room number five to Mrs. Smith. (Carl mutters) The lady in room, number five. Go on now. Go on, Carl, I'm right behind you. (Regina panting) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Can't you knock before you enter a room? What do you want? (Carl grunts) Thank you. (Carl mutters) What is it? - I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. - You did what? - Go on downstairs. Move it, go. - I think he was trying to tell me something. - No, I think he likes you. He only tries to make conversation with people he likes. You really must try to eat something. - Il can't! - I'll get you something to eat. - Yes, Margaret, what is it? - It's Carl. Mr. Burke, I was wondering if you'd be kind enough to help supervise Carl with the kindling. We use up quite a bit of wood here in the fireplace, it gets rather chilly nights. He really can’t handle it without supervision Mary and I have our hands full. So I was wondering if you'd be kind enough to help supervise him? - Why certainly, I'd be happy to. What is it you want? - Well, the wood's usually brought in from outside to dry out and then it's brought up here to burn. Just help him carry it in and send him up with it. - Of course. Are you all right, Jennifer? - Oh, you go right ahead. Don't worry about me. I think I'm going to spend some time with Regina. She should have someone to talk to. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Where's Carl? - Carl. (suspenseful orchestral music) Carl, don't be frightened. This is Mr. Burke. - Ba? - Yes. He's going to help you with the wood. - Wood. (mutters) - Yes, now, I want you to do just what Mr. Burke tells you to do, you hear? You better take this with you. - I couldn't use that on him. - Well you probably won't have to, but it's the only thing he understands. Now, Carl, you take Mr. Burke downstairs. - Downstairs? - That's right, go on now. Thank you. (suspenseful orchestral music) (wood thudding) (shadowy figure shouts) (dramatic music) (Robert grunting) (Robert screams) (dramatic music) - Did you look outside for him? - I looked all over. - Did you check the cellar again? - I did! - Well I don't why they can't at least be on time for dinner. - Is Mrs. Smith coming down for dinner? - No, I told her I'd take her up something later. - Well, we can't wait any longer, the turkey will be dried out. - Do you want to call them in or shall 1? - You go, I'll get the turkey. - Dinner's served. - Oh, are we going to eat without Robert? - What about Regina? - We don't know where Mr. Burke is, and dinner really can't wait any longer. As for Mrs. Smith, I told her I'd take something up to her later. - I must apologize for Robert. It's not like him to be so inconsiderate. - He might've gone for a walk and got lost. - Well, it isn't fair to Margaret and Mary. Let's have dinner. All right, Margaret. (light orchestral music) (dramatic music) (chairs scrape) (women scream) (sisters sobbing) - For God's sake, Louise, will you stop crying? It's not going to do any good. - 1 can't help it! - 1 didn't mean to snap at you. It's just that I feel so helpless. I don't know which way to turn. I wish we'd never come to this goddamn island! - Swearing isn't gonna help. - Sorry. - Where's Robert? Where's Robert? I don't know what's happened to him. - There's gotta be some way we can get off this island. - No there isn't (indistinct). (rapid knocking) -Who is it? - It's Margaret. - [John] What do you want? - May I speak to you for a moment? - Don't go out there! - Oh, for God's sakes, it's only Margaret. What is it, Margaret? - The lawyer, Schaeffer, has requested that the trunk be taken downstairs for the reading of the will. And, well, I as wondering if you'd help Carl take it downstairs. - Where is it? - Right down here. It's right here in this room. - Couldn't it wait until Schaeffer comes? - I'm afraid there won't be time. And it's imperative that the trunk be down there for the reading of the will. Well, after that, you all leave for the city immediately. The boat won't walit. (Margaret knocks) Carl. (suspenseful orchestral music) Carl, see that trunk there? Pick it up, take that end. Pick it up, that's the way. (trunks thuds) (Carl grunts) - Here, let me take the other end. - Come on. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Put it down, down. Now listen, Carl, lift it and put it on my back. (Carl grunts) The trunk, Carl, on my back. - Lift. (suspenseful orchestral music) I think you'd better go into your room. Lock the door. (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic music) (Carl grunts) Pick it up, Carl. (light orchestral music) - That's it? - Yes, thank you very much. - I'm going downstairs to take another look at the cellar. - I don't think you should, I think you oughta stay upstairs with them. - No, I'm going downstairs. There has to be an explanation. - Very well. Carl, you stay here and help me. - I'll be right back. (suspenseful orchestral music) (clock ticking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (clock chimes) (clock ticking) (water dripping) (light airy music) 1880, to my favorite daughter, M.H., love J.H. (suspenseful orchestral music) (John screams) (dramatic music) (John screams) (John gags) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Mary. Where are you going with that? - I'm going to put it out. - Aren't they up yet? - There is Mrs. Halverson's room. - For heaven's sake, give me that. Go up and get them some towels. (suspenseful orchestral music) (Carl panting) (birds squawking) - Carl! Carl! (wood thudding) Carl! Where are you? Carl. What are you doing under there? Come out. Come on out now. Carl, what are you? What have you got there? Carl, come out now. Carl! Carl! (dramatic music) Carl, what is it? (Carl sobs) Just let me help, Carl. (Carl sobbing) It's all right, Carl. Carl, look at me. Now what is it? Tell me. You can trust me. Tell me, Carl. (Carl screaming) What? (Carl screaming) What, Carl? (bird squawking) (Carl grunting) 1880, to my favorite daughter, M.H., love J.H. Why, that's Mr. Handley. Who's M.H.? (Carl grunting) Of course! (Mary screams) (dramatic music) (Carl screaming) (dramatic music) (lamp thuds) (glass shatters) (Carl screaming) (sisters screaming) - Do you know who I am? Meet your sister, Margaret. That's right, your sister, you didn't know that, did you? 40 years ago, I was first-born in this house. My mama died when I was born. My papa loved my mama very much. He was so alone, so he married again, but he was so heartbroken that he only came back seven times, seven visits. And he laid with that woman, her picture down there and my dining room. That bitch, your mother! Out of those visits three more girls were conceived, you Jennifer, you Louise, and Regina. He never knew how cruel she was to me. She promised to care for me as if I were her very own, but she hated me! And every time she'd looked into my eyes she blamed me for his not coming back. Whenever he did come back she'd fawn over me, pamper me, and dress me, and pretend I was her favorite in front of him. But he was gone the next morning, and then I was beaten and starved, and forced into servitude. Then she had an idea. She bought two infants, Mary and Carl, and raised them as my brother and sister. Through the years I discovered all this, all the clues to my real identity. And I waited and waited for my day of vengeance, This morning, that trunk down there in the parlor will reveal all the proof I need. When Schaeffer arrives, everybody'll be gone except me. And do you know who killed them? Carl. Poor, stupid, Carl. That same Carl that your mother beat so unmercifully that he's a half-wit. So I fixed it so there's no doubt that he did. Of course I had to kill him. It self defense. You had no idea I was so clever, huh? Meek, charming, little Margaret. (laughs) You see, I really couldn't have done it without his help. He was very useful to me while he was alive. He'll be even more useful now that he's dead. I really ought to thank your mother for making him such a half-wit. Goodbye, Jennifer. Goodbye, Louise. (sisters scream) (dramatic orchestral music) - Margaret. (sister screaming) (dramatic orchestral music) (light knocking) - [Both] Save us! (rapid knocking)
