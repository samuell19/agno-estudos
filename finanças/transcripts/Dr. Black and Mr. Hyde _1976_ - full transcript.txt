- We'd like to, at this time, show you one of the labs here at the research center. - Was it 1970 or 1971 that you won the Anvil Prize for medical research, doctor? - [laughing] It was 1971. Dr. Pride tends to be very modest when it comes to discussing his achievements. - Listen that's all well and wonderful but true recognition, if it comes at all, should come from persons cured and not from one's peer group. This way please, gentlemen. [slow saxophone music] [upbeat funky music] - How are you today, doctor? - Well, I'm pretty good Betty, how are you? - Oh fine, thank you. - What's in line today? - Not many today. Charlie Lacalle is in room one. - Old Charlie's here, fantastic. Thank you, Betty. - Well Charlie, this is a big improvement. You're doing real well. You keep up the arm exercises, and come back in about two weeks, okay? - Yes. - Alright then. Hello Linda. - Hiya, Doc. - Why is it you will not let the nurse give you your vitamin shots? - Oh man, she uses a square needle. - But don't you get tired of coming in here and having me stick needles in you? - Well your needle's the only needle ever stuck in my ass. Tell you that much. - Inhale please. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. You're recovering quite nicely from your bout with hepatitis. Lie down please. Now I don't want to sound like I'm preaching, but obviously prostitution is not the healthiest job to have. Do you have pain there? Not to mention what it does for you psychologically. - Ah, the good doctor again, trying to save my soul. - You know you are intelligent and beautiful, and there are so many things you can do. - You mean like a maid in some tacky hotel cleaning toilets? Thanks, but no thanks. I like what I'm doing. - That's such a cop out. - Oh what do you know about it, mister big shot doctor? You're the cop out. The only time you're ever around black people is when you're down here clearing your conscience. - Oh, Linda please. - You know that white coat really suits you. 'Cause you don't know nothing about the ghetto. I mean you dress white, you think white. You probably even drive a white car. And you know what? If I was white, I just might have a chance. - Now do you feel better? - Well listen, just don't judge me, 'cause you don't know what it's like out there turning tricks trying to put food on the table and pay your rent. - I'm sorry. Please step down, I'll give you your shot. - What's it of? Not your fault. I know you mean well, Doc. See you next week, huh? If you ever need a little company, you can always find me at the Moonlight Lounge. - Hi. - [Henry] Hi baby. - What are you doing here so late? - Well, I have some notes to record at the library, so here I am. - Well even a doctor could use some fun at night. I could use some food. - Well if you must know, I have this very heavy thing going with a guinea pig in the lab. - Oh, I knew there was another woman. - You hurt? - Yeah. So, no food huh? You want me to stay here and help you? - I don't think so, you may as well go home, it's okay. - Home? Home to my lonely single apartment? - Oh, baby. - Okay. You promise me you won't work so hard. - I promise you I won't work too hard. - Okay. - I'll call you later. - Sounds great. - September 15. 11:27 PM. Subject, experiments concerning the retardation of extreme cases of cirrhosis of the liver. [bubbling] [suspenseful music] Come on, come on. Total reduction in pigmentation. [rat squeaking] [rat squeaking] Hey! I'd better move you out of there, you're getting too feisty here. Come on. Come on, in you go, here. Ow! - Good heavens, Henry, are you trying to work yourself to death? - Mmm. What time is it? - It's 7:35, you've been here all night. - I have? Mmm, oh damn. Oh, dammit. - Looks like they had a free for all, huh? Look I hope it isn't too bad, whatever it is. - That's just it, I don't know what it is. I mean I cannot conduct research falling asleep. - Now look, don't blame yourself. Look, I gotta go, I gotta go pick up some samples. You'll be at the meeting At ten? - [Henry] Yeah. Yeah. [machine churning] [liquids bubbling] Tests conducted on laboratory animals have proved inconclusive, need human reaction to serum to determine side effects over and above liver restoration. [sighs] A dozen rabbits. Guinea pigs, rats. The chemistry's not right. Chemistry's not right. I need a human factor. That's right, I need a human factor. What am I saying? - It's Emily Johnson, where do you want her? - Johnson, let's see. - Yeah, she's in pretty bad shape, too. The nursing home just took her and put her up on a shelf and left her there. - [Nurse] No family, friends, no one to notify? - No, nobody's even listed on her records in the nursing home either. - Okay, I'll check into it. Put her in 7B, I'll call Dr. Pride and see if he'll take a look at her. - Yeah, well I doubt if she even makes it through the night. Come on, let's go. [phone ringing] - Hello, research, Dr. Worth. Oh yes, okay. There's a liver patient in 7B you want to see about, it's pretty bad. - This could be a good chance to try out that serum. - No you can't try that serum on a human. That's not right. - It's not right, huh? What's right? What is right? To stand around and watch somebody die, not trying to save them? Is that right? That's how my mother died, remember that? People standing around doing nothing. [slow saxophone music] [screaming] - What's going on here? [woman groaning] Hey, hey, you alright? What happened? - I, I don't know! Oh! Good Lord, look! - Billie? Do me a favor and check on the patient in 7B and see how she's doing, would you please? - Hello, this is Dr. Worth. Would you check on Emily Harris in 7B, please? Thank you. Oh yes. Well, uh, send the record to Dr. Pride right away please. Thank you. Patient in 7B died. Nurse said something strange happened, she'll put it in the report. - Oh damn. Five years of work and nothing? - Five years, 10 years Henry, what difference does it make? We can't stop now. - I tried to save her, Billie. - I know. - I really did. - I know. - If she were not so near death, I would never have used the serum. - You did use the serum on that lady. - Yeah. - Well Henry, maybe the serum was too strong for her heart. - I don't think so. See the problem is I don't know when I'm gonna get another human patient. [suspenseful synthesized music] [screaming] [suspenseful bass line] [gasping] [gasping] [groaning] [sudden dramatic music] [upbeat jazz music] [men talking] [car honking] - [Man] Check this dude, man, what is it? Hey man, that dude down here, shit. Looks like he's about to pay us a little visit. Hey pop, you're in the wrong side of town. - Can you tell me where the Moonlight Lounge is? - Hear that? This fruity fruit wants to know where the - [All] Moonlight Lounge is. [laughing] - This dude is really looking for a little piece of coon cat. - Right. - What you know about that. - Well you're not going to tell me? - What is this? You better move your ass outta here fast, if you know what's good for you. - Hear what the man said? Ow! [yelling] [groaning] [yelling] [men yelling] - Where's the Moonlight Lounge? - Put me down! Main and 6th. On the corner, you can't miss it. [yelling] [glass breaking] [cars honking] [upbeat lounge music] - I'm not kidding, Linda. That sucker asked me to move in with him. - Yeah, well what about his wife? - That's what I said, and he said, "Don't worry about that, doll. "I'll tell her you're the new live-in maid." [laughing] - A live-in, huh? - From the distinguished pimp, Preston. - Preston. Shit, that dude don't never let up on my ass. - Is he still asking you to join his fucking Abby rent harem? - [Linda] Girl you better believe it. - I hear he's got some good connections uptown. - Well I don't care what he's got. When I quit tricking for Silky, I promised myself that I wasn't working for no goddamn man again. What I make, I'm gonna keep. - Oh, well. Here's to the good lib, ladies. - Besides, someday I'm getting out of this racket. - Well what you gonna do, hon? - I dunno, but there's gotta be something better than this. - Uh oh, here comes your ex-boss. I gotta run, see you later, sweetie. - Okay Gwen, take it easy. - Splitting already, Gwen baby? - I gotta call my mama, motherfucker. - Yeah well, when you see her, tell her know where to send the money. Oh man, you gonna take her plate? You got it? - I got what, Silky? - Damn, never play no shit with me, you got my shit? - Yeah, I got it, I got it. Let's be stepping into my office here, we'll talk some business, hmm? - Oh man. I should call mine. I can lag. - You hold on to that, Silky boy. You're not forgetting our deal? - Yeah, I remember. - You convince Linda to come back working for me, or this here is gonna be the last fix you ever gonna see from this honky. You dig, nigger? - Yeah, now give me my shit. - I'm gonna give you exactly one week, and that bitch better be back in my stall, huh? [laughing] - Come to Papa. [snorting] Oh yeah. [upbeat jazz saxophone] [people talking] How's the foxiest lady at the bar? - Some bullshit. Look Silk, you just lay off before you get started, okay? - Oh, what's the matter? - I said I was through with you, now fuck off. - Ooh, I heard that. Listen. Nobody talks to Silky like that. - Let go of me, Silky. - Nobody walks out on Silky. - I said let go of me. [laughing] [crowd mumbling] - Linda. - Away from me, man. - Come outside with me now. - I said get away from me. - Linda! - Hey man, you heard the lady. She said she don't know you. [screaming] [crowd panicking] [screaming] [yelling] [yelling] [screaming] [crowd panicking] Well don't just stand there like bunch of dumbasses, get him! - There he is, get him! [men yelling] This ain't the one. - Well where'd he go? - [Man] Say, you see a white dude come charging through here? - I ain't seen nobody tonight. - Shit. - Did you find him? - No, just this dude. - Well keep looking, he hadn't come this way, he must be hiding. Shit. [children's TV show] - Hey girl, come on in. - Jimmy, Cathy, what do you mean waking Linda? Now get yourself outside and play. - Aww, Mom. - [Bernie] I said move! - Aw, Bernie, they can watch it. - They can wait until we get our fix. You must have the patience of Job to put up with us the way you do. - You and those kids are my family. Closest I've ever had to one anyway. - When Gus died, it really got tough for us. I worry about them. Suppose something happened to me. - Bernie, ain't nothing gonna happen to you, so quit worrying about nothing. [laughing] - Linda forgive me for keeping you waiting, I didn't mean to do that. - No sweat, Doc. I'm not exactly a paying customer, you know. Hey, what happened to your hand? - It was nothing at all, please turn around. - Mmm, you smell nice. A doctor that wears aftershave lotion to work. I like that. - That's called bedside manner, I learned that in med school. There you are. You know you must be taking very good care of yourself because your lab tests came out negative. That's very good news. - Hey, I don't mess around with my liver. I take my pills, watch my diet, and sleep til noon. - How about dinner tonight? - Are you serious? - Yes. - Am I for dessert? - No. It's not like that at all. We'll talk, get to know each other, we'll talk about you. Call it fatherly advice. And there will be no hanky panky. - Hanky panky's my business, Doc. - But not tonight. You're off duty. - Okay, it's a date. - About seven o'clock? - Sounds fair. - Okay. - Oh Doc? - Yeah? - You don't know where I live. - Well that's why we doctors have these records. [laughing] - It's a phony. - You see, you are a wicked woman. - Here you go. About seven? - Good. - Bye now. - [Henry] Bye. - Oh, excuse me Doc. - Yes. - This here nurse said I gotta get some vitamin pills for Jimmy. - Well what's the problem? - I ain't got no money for no vitamins. This little baby ain't never gonna get well. - No, don't you worry about that. - What am I gonna do? I ain't got nothing but some food stamps. - Okay, what you'll do, now next week, when you bring him in, stop at the desk, and you ask for me personally. Will you do that for me? - Yes. - Okay. - Bless you Dr. Pride, bless you. God bless you. - Okay, bye bye. - [Linda] Hey Doc? - Yeah? - I'll order something cheap tonight to make up for that kid. - You were not supposed to see that, you see that is the father image in me. - Oh, is that so? - Yes. - [Linda] Oh, okay. - Billie, you're still here? - Obviously. - Uh oh. I recognize that tone. - You used that old lady as a guinea pig, didn't you? We could have lost everything. - Look, I took an oath to save lives. And sometimes that oath makes it very difficult. - Henry, I love you! But I found some of that serum missing again this morning. - So you're accusing me? - Yes! Look, I know how important this project is to you. But if we get involved in anything illegal, it's gonna ruin us! - Don't worry about me, okay Billie, I'm alright. - You haven't heard a word I said, have you? I mean you, you don't even hear me! - [Jimmy] Not like that. - Girl, they're getting so big. - Yeah, they are. I don't know what I'm gonna do with Cathy. - Hey Jimmy, ahh! Good throw! Okay, catch now, catch! Very good, very good. Girl, you ought to see this doctor. - Oh I'm dying to see him. - Oh. Oh, look Cathy, here comes my doctor, y'all. Gotta go. Come on. - The way you talking, I want to get a little closer, I wanna get a good look. - [Linda] Oh girl. Come on then, come on. Hiya Doc. I want you to meet my best friend, Bernice Watts, and her two live wires, Cathy and Jimmy. - You're really a doctor? You don't look like a doctor to me. [laughing] - I wouldn't mind you making a house call on me myself, Doc. - Alright, Bernie. Lay off. [laughing] - Can I go with you, Linda? - Not this time, Honey. Okay? - Can I? - [Linda] No, no, no. Here. You guys have your own party, okay? See you later. - Bye. - [Linda] Bye bye. - Bye. - [Bernie] Goodbye. - I saw that. - Oh did you? You weren't supposed to. I guess that's the mother image in me? [laughing] [romantic piano music] That was delicious. Absolutely delicious. - I'm very glad you enjoyed it. - You know I could get used to this very easily. - Is that so important? - It is if you've never had it. - I got a surprise for you. - Surprise, what kind? - Well you gotta come to my house. - Oh I get it. You get the check, and I pay the bill. - Well you gotta get something. - Okay. - I'm just kidding, come on. It's not like that, you know that. - Well what the hell, it was worth it. - You ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. But I dunno for what. [laughing] Wow, is this where you live? - [Henry] Well my mother used to live here. - [Linda] Your mother? - [Henry] Yeah. I guess I should say she used to work here a long time ago. - Really? What kind of work? - She was a maid. This was at one time, believe it or not, a very high-class whorehouse. - Well, what do you know about that? - When I was a boy, my mother would take me up the back steps. We lived in a room in the back. And she'd leave me there while she would go out and clean up the filth, and change the bed sheets, and empty the trash, and clean the toilets, and look after those ladies of the evening. My mother worked much too hard, and she was very lonely. She drank a lot. And she developed this uh, liver condition. One evening, she was feeding us dinner and she turned to me to say something, and she just fell over. I didn't know what to do. I went out in the hall and I I started knocking on all the doors, I was screaming, "Somebody gotta help my mama. "Somebody gotta help my mama." And not one of those ladies opened the door. And she just died. - You must have loved her very much. - Yeah. [car starting] Yeah. [Henry and Linda talking] Madam. I always liked Italian restaurants better. - I like poultry myself. - Oh, iffy? - I love this painting. - Thank you. I've been collecting about what, 20 years. - Really? - I think I'll have a drink. So please sit down, - [Linda] Okay. - and make yourself at home. - Hey, now what about that surprise you had? - Listen. Linda, what would you say if I told you that I had discovered a serum that has the capability of curing you permanently? You would not have to come to the free clinic again. Do you know what I'm saying? - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm very serious. It is not yet perfected. It is still somewhat experimental. But I have great faith and confidence that this serum can totally regenerate damaged liver tissues and cells. - Well, just what do you mean by "somewhat experimental"? - Well, there are some side effects that I'm not yet sure of. - Now wait, Doc. Let me get it straight. You want to use me for some type of human guinea pig, is that it? No thanks. - Just think how this can help other people. - Well frankly Doc, I never quite pictured myself as a Florence Nightingale type. So just forget it, okay? - What if I insist? - I said forget it Doc. Would you take me home now please? What are you doing with that? - It won't hurt. Listen. - Now look Doc. I'll make a deal with you. - Deal? - Now you try that serum on yourself first. And then I'll do it, okay? - Okay. I'll shoot myself first. Just to show you there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing. Okay? [suspenseful music] Nothing to it. [suspenseful bass line] [grunting] - God, what have you done to yourself? - And now, you must try. - Stay away from me. - In a moment, you'll look like me. - Horrible. - Look at my hands. Look at my face. - No I won't! - You'll know what I know, you'll feel what I feel. [fast-paced funk music] [car braking] - Miss, are you hurt? - Please, help me! - Just lie back and relax. I'll call for help. Control, control, this is security one, come in please. [voices on radio] Lady, come back! Come back! [upbeat jazz music] - Ugh! [sirens blaring] - Find out who she was? - Yeah. Sally Lewis. Lived in the complex. She was a hooker. - Any boyfriends, husband, suspects? - In the black community, Harry, nobody knows nothing, nobody sees nothing, and nobody hears nothing. - Well somebody really did a job on her, didn't they. - [Jackson] Yeah. That's what bothers me. - What do you mean? - Well you know, if it had been the regular bit, like a murder, stabbing, shooting, beating, then we could understand it and have the proclivity to solve it. But this little lady has had her neck crushed, like in a vice. Meaning somebody has put some shit into the game. Know what I mean, man? [lounge music] - If things don't pick up, I'm gonna go home and climb into the old workbench by myself. - Ah girl, what do you expect for a Tuesday night? - Let's go up to Hollywood, I understand that's where the action is. - No that's where all the fags is. Girl if one of them got up there, and found out you wasn't in drag, they'd die. [laughing] That's right. Oh, things are bound to pick up over the weekend anyway. - Hope so, 'cause I'm running short on bread, and I'm horny too. [laughing] Fuck it. I'm going home. - Okay, see you later. [ominous music] [screaming] - Central, one moment please. - Sure, I know this isn't the usual type of ghetto murder. Of course it's some kind of nut, but what-- Sure. Alright, alright, I'll get back to you. Okay. Jive-ass sucker. - Yes sir, what's going down? In the alley? Oh Jesus Christ. Okay, thanks man. Yeah. - Hey where you been, man? I mean downtown's on our ass like stink on shit, man. What'd you find out? - Got a fuckin' second one on our hands. They found another hooker strangled in the alley. That's two hookers killed the same way in the past three days. - What are you trying to tell me, man? - I'm trying to tell you we've got a man who thinks he's a citizen helping us clean up the community. - In other words, we've got a facsimile of Jack the Ripper here huh? - Oh boy, sometime you really use your head, you know that? - Have the patrol in that area increase to a one to five ratio. - That's a fuckin' good idea. You know, the coroner's reports say it was a mighty strong dude who killed those two broads. - Powerful dude, huh? You better get our ass into the waiting line. Downtown wants a man soon and we're gonna have to deliver. [lounge music] - Linda, Baby. Get into the street. It'll only take a couple of hours. You know, two dudes, in town for the night. Need a couple of ladies. At a hotel by the airport. Now do this for Silky, huh? - Silky, honey, you mighty pretty. But you still a creep. Now I told you, I ain't tricking for you no more, so just get off it. This lady's in business for herself. - Linda. It's a phone call for you. Hey. It's a trick, baby. I'll be right there. - What's going on? That girl got no action for you. I am working for you. She is not. - Cool it. I won't be needing you. Brenda here is going to take your place, mama. - Now you're not talking about miss no class, now are you? - Watch it. - Because if you are those guys at the airport hotel - I said watch it! - are gonna throw you out on the runway! - Grow up bitch! - Who you calling bitch, ho? [women screaming] - Let's break it up and cut the bullshit, huh? - Cool it ladies, like I said. The pigs are here. Oh, excuse me, officer. I meant, the police. - You better get to stepping while you still can. Understand, poobah? Now, we want to ask a few questions. - We don't like questions around here. - Listen brother. You tell us what we want to know, and we won't hassle you. Now, Cissy Hubbard and Sally Lewis used to hang out here, right? - So what if they did? - So we just want some information from some people who knew 'em. - We don't know nothing, sir. - What the fuck is the matter with you, man? Two of your own kind brutally strangled and you won't help us. [Harry yelling] - Cool it man. - What the fuck is the matter with him? - It's cool, it's cool, I'll take care of it. - You fucking asshole. - Just cool it, we'll handle it. We'll take care of it. Brother man, this situation is rapidly becoming insalubrious. Meaning, we about to stomp a mudhole in your ass. - Now wait a minute. Now I'll tell you all anything I can. Cissy was a friend of mine. Okay? - Okay miss. Anything you can say might be helpful. I'll deal with you later. - I didn't know Sally, but Cissy was more my kind. - When was the last time you saw her? - Last night before she left here. - Oh? What time was that? - A little after midnight. I told her to be careful, but she didn't seem to be afraid. And Cissy didn't have an enemy in the world. - How about Sally Lewis? - She never got close to anybody that I know. She'd come in two or three nights a week, go home with anybody who had a couple of bucks. - Well she had a couple kids. - [Linda] I didn't know that. - Well has anybody new come in here, any strangers? - We don't get too many strangers. We-- - [Jackson] Yes? Yes? - Uh, no, nothing. - Well if you think of anything else miss, would you please give us a call? Here's my card. - Sorry I wasn't much help. - You cooperated, that's what's important. - Yeah, thanks. See we'd better hit it Harry. We've got to cover as many of these joints as we possibly can tonight. - Thank you miss. - You know? Can't help thinking I've seen that young lady someplace before. - Probably the lineup. [people laughing] - Okay, oh, no I'm fine. [laughing] Okay, bye bye. - Let me have a little more of that. Oh good. Hey, can you hold on to that? - Okay. - Better let one out. - That's enough. - Yeah, a little bit for the mommy. [snorting] Alright. Little bit for the mommy in the back. Mmm hmm. Alrighty there, miss. You got Pam Pam home in one piece. Alright. That's enough. You got to have food stamps for more. [laughing] You like chocolate. - Dude I am in speech. - I'm getting up front. [women talking] Bye bye! - Bye bye! [ominous music] - Hiii-ya! [yelling] [woman yelling] [dramatic funk music] [screaming] [car screeching] [upbeat funk music] [car screeching] [screaming] [screaming] [serene woodwind music] [newspaper dropping] [sudden dramatic music] [dramatic piano music] - Another man. This is not like you, Dr. Pride. You're real. And it's too late to change. - Henry? Henry? - [Henry] Yes Billie. - Are you alright? - [Henry] Yeah, sure. Why? - The last few days you've been acting kind of weird. - [Henry] Weird? - Yeah, when's the last time you had a check up? - Listen, I said I feel fine. I don't need a checkup now. Come on. - I wouldn't mean to pry. - That's alright. I'm sorry. - That's alright. - I've been acting crazy, right? - Yeah. - Why don't we get away for a few days or something? - Well my parents still have that cabin up in Bear Mountain we can go there anytime you want to. - A cabin in Bear Mountain? - Yeah. - I remember that cabin. [laughing] - I gotta go. I'll see you later. - Alright. Billie. Take care. [romantic woodwind music] Pride speaking. - Henry, it's Linda. - How are you doing? - Just fine, thanks. Henry, I've got to see you. It's very important. - Okay. - Can you meet me at about six at the Watts Towers? - I can be there. See you then. - [Linda] Okay. - Yes, fine. - Bye bye. [serene music] - Well how are you? - I'm alright, I guess. - I was very surprised that you called me. But I was glad. Because I felt that um, maybe I didn't apologize right, or enough, or whatever, but I'm sorry about the other night. I'm sorry. - I never thought it could be possible. - Thought what could be possible? - That after this past week you can just sit there talking like nothing happened. Unreal. Look, I want you to give yourself up. I know you're the one that's been doing all the killings. Doctor. You need help. And if you don't give yourself up, I'll have to go to the police myself. - Linda-- - How could you do it yourself, doctor? - I couldn't help myself. There's this thing buried inside me that won't die. I can't make it go away. I despise them all for letting my mother die. All of them! But you were right. I could not believe. It was not your fault. I guess I've been living my life in a fog or something. - Doc, you've made it. But you're letting a war rage inside you. You know I thought I was in love with you at first. But you made it quite clear that I was only a patient. Thanks for not playing with me, Doc. I don't know what kind of man you are now. But I know you need help before you hurt somebody else. I gotta get back. - Get back to what? The same life you've been living? - What else do I know? - I'm sorry you said that. I can't help myself. And I will not let you turn me in. - Go on home, Harry, and get yourself some sleep. - Yeah, I would if the phone would stop ringing-- [knocking on door] and nobody would knock at the door. Yeah, who is it? - Excuse me, Lieutenant. - Yeah, what do you want? - It's a girl outside. Says she's got some information. - Bring her in. You go on home Harry, and I'll check her story out. - You know why I do this racket? Because I'm curious. Don't understand it. - Suit yourself. - Lieutenant O'Connor. - [Harry] Come in. - I remember you from the club the other night. - What can we do for you Miss uh, - Monte. Linda Monte. - Linda Monte. Oh please, sit down. - Sit right there. Okay what is it? - I know who the killer is. - What makes you so sure? - I just left him. I told him if he didn't turn himself in, I would. - So who is it? - His name is Henry Pride. Dr. Henry Pride. - Just what makes you so sure? - Believe me, Lieutenant, he's the killer. And I just might get killed for telling you this. - Okay. You wanna check out this cock and bull story about a black doctor who turns white at night, huh? Let me tell you something, you're gonna get us demoted, you know that? - Well maybe so, Harry, but I'm gonna check it out anyway. You go on home and I'll call you later. - I'd just like to know what makes you so damn confident that it's true. - Well read this. - Okay. So she reads this paper about this black doctor and she concocts this fantasy. Black doctor turns white at night, huh? Shit. [laughing] - Well like I said, I'm gonna check it out anyway, Harry. You go on home. [kids talking] Dr. Worth, the university told me I could find you here. I'm Lieutenant Jackson from homicide. I'd like to ask you a few questions concerning Dr. Henry Pride. - What happened, is something-- - Oh no, there's nothing wrong or anything like that. You see, I just want to get some information. - Oh, thank heavens. - [Jackson] Do you know a Linda Monte? - I know that she's one of Henry's patients at the free clinic. - Well do you know of any reason why she might want to harm him? - No. Uh, Henry often makes the mistake of getting personally involved with his patients but, well you see, Lieutenant he's not just a very important man, he's also very kind. - I've read the stories in the papers. Dr. Worth I understand you and Dr. Pride are doing some extensive research in the area of biochemistry. - Yes. - May I ask you a few questions concerning that? - Well I'm afraid that's very confidential at this time. I couldn't tell you anything more. [knocking on door] - Bernice is that you? - [Bernice] Yeah, do you have a minute? - Sure. Come on in, just getting ready for work. - Linda baby, you're not going out tonight are you? - Of course I am, why shouldn't I? - With that mad man loose about? I don't care for you going out to that place by yourself, it ain't safe. - Hey, don't worry about me. I almost forgot. - What's this? - Jimmy's birthday's coming up, get him something nice from me. - Oh Linda, you're a darling. This is gonna make him a very happy birthday. - I'm glad. - Linda. When you gonna get a man of your own, and settle down? - I almost did once. Hey, I gotta get. I'm late already. Give Jimmy a kiss for me, okay? - Okay. Night, girl. - See you later. - Linda. Linda get in the car. Come here. Come back, Linda, dammit! [exciting funk music] - Bernie! Bernie, he's after me! Come with me, come on, get out! [screaming] [woman yelling] Operator! Help! [exciting funk music] [screaming] [yelling and panicking] [yelling] [screaming] [gunfire] [gunfire] [screaming] [exciting funk music] [suspenseful synthesized music] [sirens blaring] [sirens] [screaming] [sirens] - I almost got to sleep this time. - Well judging from the suspect's description, I figured you'd want to be in on the bust, Harry. - Really tore up the apartment, huh? - I think we're dealing with a haint, man. - What the fuck is a haint? - That's a cross between the Abominable Snowman and Willie the Werewolf. - Haint? Who the fuck ever heard of a haint? - There he is, get him! - Jesus Christ. - Now that is a haint. - Jesus Christ. - There, down the alleyway. - Over there. [men yelling] - Look get on the wire and get every available unit to get their ass here as soon as possible, we're gonna need them. - Right. - And get the dogs. - He just kill a dog, Harry. - Well get us a couple of sharpshooters. Where's the fucking bullhorn? - Get a hold of Dr. Worth at UCLA research and get her here on the double. - Got him in between two buildings. Get the whole area surrounded, he's got a hostage. Now get going! Surrounded, but don't shoot. I don't want any needless bloodshed. And keep those fucking people back. [police sirens] [men yelling] Give yourself up. Let the girl go. [yelling] Give yourself up or we're gonna be forced to shoot. - You can't fire on these towers, Harry. It'd be like firing on the Lincoln Monument. - Just let her down. Put her down. - Get the handcuffs on him. [yelling] [crowd screaming] Take it easy. Take it easy. Go get the handcuffs on him. Easy. [men yelling] Dogs! Dogs! Dogs! [dogs barking] [dog growling] - Shit. - Holy fuck. We'll have to smoke this bastard out. Here, take that! [Henry screaming] [screaming] [screaming] Get the chopper to the south side. - [Voiceover] Roger, Lieutenant. We've got him spotted. We're on the way in right now. [moaning] [men talking] - Look, his eyes are sensitive to the light. - You're right. Get that light onto his face! - [Voiceover] Chopper one, come in chopper one, do you read me? Roger. Looking like it's gonna be a problem on the south side. I'll give it a go anyway. [Henry yelling] - Shine the light! - [Voiceover] There's no way we're gonna make it on the windward side, Lieutenant. I'm gonna try it from another direction. - This is your last chance. Give yourself up or we'll start shooting. I'll give you 10 seconds to climb down. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. Fire! [gunfire] [gunfire] Hold your fire! [screaming] [moaning] [moaning] [dramatic synthesized music] [yelling] - Henry. You know I love you. [somber music] - [Man] Who was he? - Dr. Henry Pride.
