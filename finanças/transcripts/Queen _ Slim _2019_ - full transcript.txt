You tell us where they went, we'll let you go and you can enjoy the rest of your evening. MR. SHEPHERD: Now, how can I tell you where they went if they were never here? Then where'd the fancy car come from? People park their cars around here all the time. You look a lot smarter than your husband. You wanna tell me where they went? OFFICER: Sergeant? (WHISPERING) We have to leave here at some point. I'm not trying to walk into an ambush. I heard cars leave hours ago. I'm sure they left some folks behind to keep an eye on the house.

Over here. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Okay, I know I can do this, but you gotta promise not to scream. Can you do that? I believe in you. I think there are cops out front and if they hear you, it's over. We're done. I know how strong you are. You can do this. Wait. Give me your jacket. Here. Take that. (SOBBING) All right. One. (MOANS SOFTLY) (WHIMPERING) Two. (BONE CRACKS) (MUFFLED SCREAM) (SLIM SHUSHING) (SOBBING) It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Did you hear that? Hear what? It sounds like somebody's crying. That's just nature. You city boys ain't used to that shit. Don't refer to me as a boy. I ain't no boy. You know what I meant. I know the difference between a person and an animal, too. Then go walk around. You watch how you talk to me, man. Ooh. Touchy, touchy. I need to find a screwdriver. You know how to boost a car? I used to. My older brother taught me one summer. Toolbox. The only car we ever stole was my dad's. He should have known better than to leave that Acura around us. Damn it!

No, they're not. How about you get in the back and get some sleep? I'll sit here, huh? Make sure nobody kills us. Take that. Thanks. (QUEEN SIGHS) I can't sleep. You want me to turn on the radio? No. I want you to tell me a story. What kind of story? Any story. I don't care. When I was little, I asked my mom where babies come from. She said I was too young to know. Then I asked my dad. He said, "Babies are a product of two people that needed something from each other." So, I said, "Needed what?" He said, "Maybe they needed to feel seen. "Maybe they needed to feel loved. "Maybe they needed to feel human." And then what? Then I asked my grandmother. She said, "Babies come from God. "They're His way of making sure no one ever really dies." I remember her saying, "Through our children, we are reborn." Then I went to my older brother. And I asked him. And he said, "Nobody knows. You're just born. "That's it. Now leave me alone." (QUEEN CHUCKLES) I wasn't satisfied with that answer either, but... I ran out of family members to ask, so he got the last word. , who was right? None of them. Babies come from fucking. Plain and simple. (GUN COCKS) Why y'all acting all scared and shit? 'Cause you're pointing a gun in my face. Man, I'm just fucking with you, player. Come on. You know the Shepherds? Hell, yeah.

How long? Damn, man, why you giving me the third degree? I'm trying to help you out. They said you had a plane. Oh, they lied about that one. If you ain't got a plane, we're not going with you. Look, man, I ain't got that kind of money. But I got a friend that do. He a bailer. He can get you whatever you want. When we get to my trailer, I'll give him a call for you. Why can't you call him right now? 'Cause I ain't got my phone on me. Damn! Look, y'all can either roll with me or stand here like some dummies and wait for the police to come get you. Yeah, all right. For sure. (MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY) All right, I got you. Well, if it's all right, I'll see you then. He gonna have the plane ready to go first thing tomorrow morning. We can't wait till tomorrow. We gotta go now. Damn, y'all some bossy motherfuckers. Call him back. Hey, man, back up. (SIGHS) Hey, sorry, bro. They tripping.
