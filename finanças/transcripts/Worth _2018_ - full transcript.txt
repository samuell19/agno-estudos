Wasn't it Tuesday, was it Thursday, man? - You said Thursday, right? - I thought Tuesday, wasn't it Tuesday? - No. - Oh man, was it supposed to be Thursday? - [Ricky] You know what, lemme get back to you. - Yeah. - [Ricky] Cause I'm not gonna know, you're not gonna know. - Yeah, yeah, see that, details, right? - Yeah, how long you been a cop again? - 22 years. - That's not too bad. - It's all right, I haven't gotten shot yet. - Hey, girl.

Um, do you have any loose change in your car maybe? - No, it's okay. - Here, I got it, don't worry about it, it should be fine. - No, you don't have to do that. - No, it's okay, I insist. - Thank you.

You don't have to. - I am free tomorrow though. - Okay, I'll take it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Cool, gimme your phone, I'll put my number in it. - What's your name? - Oh, I'm Danielle. - Danielle. - Yeah. - I'm Ricky. - Ricky. - Yep. - Well, it's nice to meet you, Ricky. - It's nice to meet you too, all right. - Saved it as pumpkin spice latte girl. - I'm gonna call that. - Come on, Ricky, god damn.

Whaddaya have in mind? - Manny wants to fight Ricky. - No shit, huh, about damn time if you ask me. - I hear you, so you think you can handle it? - Yeah, I'll bring it up with him. I'm pretty sure he'll take it, though. - Cool, well listen, I want first crack at him if he turns pro. - Well that depends, Tony. You make me a good offer and then we can talk. - All right, that's cool. Talk to you soon. Hey, hey Joe. Stay outta those handicapped strip clubs, man. - How's your mama gonna make any money then, right? - Come on, man, your left, hey, there you go, hey Earl, kick his ass, kick his fuck, oh come on!

Thank you for coming here. - No problem, um this is my paralegal, Danielle. - Sorry, just juggling my other job and school, and it really takes its toll. - We understand, it's no problem. - Here are all my pay stubs and everything from the past two years. - Fantastic. - Will they help? - Absolutely, now your ex-boss has not tried to contact you in any way since we last spoke? I need for you to take pictures of these for me. - No I haven't really been back since. I just, I don't feel very comfortable. - It's okay, I'm going to need some of your co-workers to give some testimonies. Will that be okay? - I can call around tomorrow, but-- - Okay. - They're not gonna get in trouble, right? - No, no, absolutely not. - Okay. - Do you have that? Do you need some help? I need you to take these pictures. - Hey. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late, I was comin' from work, and then I had to change in my car and then people started watchin' me and I'm just, I'm not a fan of it. - I know that struggle. - So what made you decide bowling? - I used to be on a championship bowling team. Junior league, fifth grade. - Okay, fifth grade. - Mm-hmm. - That was a minute ago, that was a while ago. - Yeah, it's been a while, but I never lose. This never happens. - It doesn't, usually I suck at bowling. - I've had enough out of you. - You won the first three games, just be happy with that, right? - Yeah, but I'm supposed to win every game. - You're really competitive, aren't you? - Yes, I am. - Keep him on the rope, nice. Stay tight, stay to the right, Luis. Stay on him, come on! - How's our boy doin'? - You know, he's doin' all right. He's okay, oy! - All right. - come on, stay there. - Tell Ricky I wanna see him, okay? - Yes, sir. Come on, throw that body kick. There, see, see? Shit. All right, get out of there. Joe wants to see you. - Hi Ricky, hey, take a seat, take a seat. - Yeah, I got you. - Everybody thinks you're doin' well. Rudy thinks you're doin' well. He won't forget his head, but he thinks you're doin' well. You won the last few fights, you won 'em well. Just wanna bring you in here and give you some news. - Okay. - News is that I still think you fuckin' suck. Your elbow strikin' sucks, your knee strikin' sucks, your whole inside game, it fuckin' sucks, all right, you've got this thing, Ricky, you've got this thing, you know, you have this blind spot on your left side, you understand? - I know. - Last guy you were fightin', if he'd had any kind of right hook he would've fuckin' knocked you out. - I know, I know. - I don't know what it is, can you see out of that eye? - I can see, yeah, I can see. I'll take care of it, no worries, okay. - Oh, oh. - What's up? - Matador Promotions called. You got a title fight. - You're lying to me. - I'm not, hey it's fuckin' legit, Ricky. We start camp tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow, the Rudy, all right? We're gonna watch some tape, get some strategy together. - Who am I fighting? - It's Manny. - He's tough. - Just take tonight, I want you to indulge, okay? - Yeah. - All right, well we haven't got the contract yet, it's just an offer, but when we get it we'll sign it and take care of business. - Yes, sir. - Tomorrow? - Sir. - Hey, one more thing. - Yeah. - Manny, last opponent, knocked him out. Right hook, okay, okay. - I saw it, I saw it, I remember. - All right, gotta work on that. - I'll take care of it. I got you. - Title fight, title fuckin' fight. - [Ricky] Title fight! - People shouldn't do that. - Dude, man, so this title fight, man, dude how do you feel, has it hit you yet? - Like four times, it's pretty big, it's a pretty big step. - Hey Rick. - Yeah. - You know you about to get your ass whooped, right? You know that, right? - That's not right at all. He's tough, he's tough. - Yeah, man, we're talkin' about Manny, dude. - Yeah. - This is Manny, man, he's good, man. - He is tough. - He is good. - He killed a man once. - Really? - No, but still. - Oh man, don't be playin' with me like that, Rick, come on, man. - He's that good. - Hey man, he's the champ for a reason. You know what, man? This is the moment you've been workin' for. The two a days, man, the three a days, man, all the times you've gone at it, man, it's all been worth it, you know? I mean, the throwin' up on me, yeah, I ain't forgot, yeah, man. - Ah, my bad. - It's all worth it. - Yeah. - I got you, that's what I'm sayin', man, you're not alone in this, you know? You got me, you got Rudy, you got everybody, man, we here for you. - Yeah. - Me and you tomorrow, man, five a.m. sparrin'. - Five a.m. - Hey man, if you throw up on me again, I get a free kick to your face, fair? - Yeah, that's fair. - Yeah, all right, all right, man. - That's fair. - So, thanks for taking me to a dead rosebush garden. - So how long exactly have you been a paralegal? - Well, I've been, I still have about two more years of school left. - Okay, and you actually like law school? - It's a lot of studying. - Yeah, that's pretty much all school, right? - Yeah, well law school a little bit more than-- - Careful. - Thank you for the catch. - Yeah, no more dancing on trees, yeah. - I'm a tree nymph, I can't help it. - I still don't understand the difference between a paralegal and a lawyer, though, and I know you told me three times. - There are a lot of things that are different. Paralegals cannot offer legal advice, and we cannot appear as counsel in court, to keep it basic. - Okay. - It's very different. - No, I believe you. - All right gentlemen, this is it. - Hey, Joe, what's goin' on? - Hey Rudy. - Oh, thanks. - Five to show, three to win, Ricky. This is the time to stand up and make a name for yourself. - Oh wow, this is it? Is that my contract? - That is your contract. - Five to show, three to win. Oh man, look at that weight. - What's the weight? - Good thing we got six weeks. - What's the weight? - You need to get down. - He's ready, Rudy? You ready, Ricky? - Is he ready? No, not yet, but can he do it? Definitely. You earned this here, some people never get this opportunity. What does that mean? That means if you think you did enough, I mean, clearly you've done enough to get here, but now that means you've gotta take it to the next level in all aspects. K, that means you have to breathe, you have to sleep, you have to eat, you have to shit, you have to do everything that's related to fighting, you understand? No distractions whatsoever, nothing. - We deal in champions here, okay? Are you a champion? - I can do this. - You can do this. - All right, I hope we get a title. Sign it, have it back on my desk. - All right. - All right? Listen to Rudy, he's your be all and end all, right? Remember what I said about the left guard, okay? He's got a fuckin' killer right hook. - Hey, no more burritos, Ricky, all right? No more, no more of that shit. - Congratulations, I'm proud of you homes. - What the hell am I doin'? - Neither have I, I mean it looks nice and I've driven past it, but I just, hello. - Thanks. - Thank you. Do you mind if I could get a second glass of water, please? - Is there something wrong with this one? - No, I just like to have two. - Oh, certainly. - Thanks. - I would have asked the same thing. - I um, there's some cool stuff that happened at work today, you know what, forget it. I'll tell you after dinner. - No, wait, what happened? - I will tell you after dinner. - You have to tell me now. - I'll tell you later, 'cause I don't know what I'm gonna eat, I'll tell you later. - Tell me now. - Okay, they can hear you. - I don't care. - Calm down. - Tell me, tell me. - So my boss Joe, he told me I have a title fight comin' up. - Really, what does that mean? - Your second water, sir. - Thank you so much. - Are we ready to order? - Um, I'm gonna do the chicken Parmesan with the soup, please. - Very nice. - Thank you. - And for you, sir? - I'm gonna have the spinach salad. - And for your entree? - That is my entree. - Of course. - He hates you. - I know, did you see face? - I hate you too. He's in training for a fight right now, though, so he doesn't eat anything but spinach and I was just eating a lot, which was kind of awkward. - You guys are too cute, it's so disgusting. - Stop it. - No, you guys are. - Why do you hate everyone I date? He's awesome. - Well, to be fair, all you dated were psychos. - Yeah, I know, but this one's different. Definitely no psycho here. - Doesn't seem like it. - I don't know, it's just easy. We hit it off really well and we have a lot of fun together. It's not forced. - Okay. - Nope. Nope. Nope. Can't have that. Nope. Oh, this is good, man, the best pasta you'll ever have in your life, bro. I mean, this is excellent, but you can't have that. - Do we really have to go through this, man? I know how to cut weight, I've done it before. - Yeah, I know, man, but this is different. You have to lose more weight and replace it with muscle. I'm talkin' about protein. You know I was just jokin' when I said he was gonna whip your ass, right? Dude, if you don't follow this he's going to whoop your ass. I mean, he's faster than you, he's stronger than you, he's cruel, and he's loco. The only way you're gonna beat this dude is with pure power. - But I mean, is box lunches really the way to go? I like home cooked meals, you know what I mean? - I mean, you don't have time to cook for yourself. We gotta train, and your ex isn't here to do it for you like last time. - Yeah, but I mean, I got a, I got a new girlfriend, you know? She could probably cook for me, I don't know. - She got a friend? - No, she does not have any friends. - Can't have that, can't have this. - So you've never been to a fight gym before? - Nope. - Nah, okay. This is usually where I teach, like kids and level one and stuff like that. - Awww. - this is where I train. That's where I train, like sparring, like me and my coach, this is where they do jiu jitsu - Okay. - This is coach Mauricio. - Hi Ricky. - Hey. - How are you doin'? - This is Danielle. - Hi. - Danielle, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - So I'm just givin' her a tour, we were gonna go train, but, I don't know if you wanna train jiu jitsu, 'cause they're doin' it already. - Try it, you're gonna like it. - Do I get to wear the coat? - Yeah. - Right on. - Great. - I got some stuff over here. - You wanna control his gi, pressure him on the ground, stand up your leg, push his knee down. Slide over his knee, control his head. You wanna put pressure, your shoulder, pressure over his face, really tight. Nice. - How is he doin' anyway? - Yo. - Oh, sup Ricky. - Hi brother. - How are you? Good? - Good, man, good to see you. - How's everything? - Everything is delicious, bro. So, how did she do in there? - Good, man, no trouble. Doing good, talented, easy learner. No trouble. - No trouble. It's fun when there's no trouble. Little problem's fun too. - Coffee? - Wanna try? - Can I? - Yeah, go ahead. Let me know what you think. - Pumpkin stuff? - Hey, don't judge, man, don't judge. - Take care, brother, have a good one. - It's the sweet stuff, you know? - That's good, that's good. - All right, this fucking guy. - Hey Joe, man, look at 'em. Ricky in love, man. - You know Ricky, I have to say, I really like this decision to have your girlfriend fight for you, you know because I think she has much better footwork and much better defense than you'll ever have. - Oh, Ricky, that's adorable. - So who's teaching who here? - Hey guys, how you doin'? - Hey mama. - Hey, what up mama? - Doin' good. - What brings you here? - I just brought Ricky some lunch. - Oh, really, you think he needs it? - I do, he's working hard, but I got you guys some too. - Okay, thank you. - You're welcome. - You spoiled, man. - Don't be spoilin' him now, mama. - [Ricky] I was born spoiled. - That's right. - Well yeah, you kind of look it. - [Ricky] Thanks mom. - Okay you guys, you're welcome sweetie, I'll see you later, okay, don't forget to call your father. - I won't. - Okay, bye mi hijo. Bye guys. - Bye mama. - All right, bye mama. - Oh, mijo, I love you so much. - Come on, now, work for your lunch. Oh, hey Tony. - Hey. - How you doin'? - Good to see you. - Yeah, you too. - So, this what you been doin'? I thought you were here trainin' for your big fight. - You're lookin' a little bit out of shape. - You wish, you look out of shape. You need to come train with me and see what happens. - Lemme, lemme get your paperwork. - Hey Tony. - Yeah. - When can I come fight for you, man? - When you learn how to fight. - That's cold, Tony. - A little bit. - That's cold, man. - Here you go, signed, sealed, delivered. - Great. - We really appreciate everything you do for us here, Tony. - Well I really appreciate what you do for my company. Don't forget you're wearing my logo now, don't embarrass me. - Hey, don't embarrass this man, you hear that? - I wanted to thank you for taking care of my medicals, I really appreciate it. - That's what I'm here for. - Thank you. - You're a good fighter. Proud to have you a part of my show. - All right, good fighter? - I'll walk you out. - Good fighter. - Hey, get back to work. - Yeah, go continue to be cute. You guys are disgusting. - Did you have a good time today? - I did. - Yeah, how'd you like training? - It was fun, I don't think I'm a fighter, though. - I wasn't gonna say anything, but-- - I don't think you're a teacher either. - Mauricio's a lot better than me. You waiting for me to make a move? - Well yeah, that's your job, I don't do it. (romantic music) - 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. 50, good job. Good job, good job, you ready for the next one? - What? - Just messin' with you. - Oh my god. - Good job, man. - So how's that lady friend of yours doin'? - Oh, the one I was tellin' you about? She's good, man, yeah, she's amazing. Like-- - Amazing. - She's smart, she's funny, she's, it's pretty serious. - Seriously? - Yeah, yeah. - Take my advice, man, enjoy your youth. - My youth, I'm not that young. For a fighter, I'm not that young. All right, you can gimme that, you can gimme that. - Yeah, well for women, you're way too young. Look, trust me, by the time I was your age I had divorced already twice. - Yeah, but you were married to two women at the same time, that doesn't count. Okay, you didn't know they were gonna run away together. - You never know when a woman's gonna leave, or what the hell they're gonna do. That's my point, smartass. - I'm just saying, you know this one, she feels different, you know. I'm happy, I'm feelin' positive, and that's all it is, that's all it is. - Well, okay. - Okay. - You want me to hit this again? - We're gonna move on to somethin' else, just take a couple, man, you're sweatin' pretty hard. How'd you like livin' in Utah anyway? - The weather was-- - Crap? - Crap. - It was just ridiculous, like my professor actually thought that I was going to be okay with a B on my term paper. You see, I just knew that he was jealous that my father makes more money in one year than he has ever, in his entire life, and I told him that too, just straight to his face. - That's so incredible, Cameron. I love you, babe. - The professors at our school forget that we pay to go there. - Do you go to school, Hector? - It's Ricky. - I don't, no, I'm not the brainy one here. - Right, you do that fighting thing. - Yes, yes I do. - MMA is it? - Muay Thai. - Pardon? - Muay Thai, Muay Thai, it's Thai kickboxing. - Oh, I thought you said Mai Tai, I was gonna be like I could totally go for one of those drinks right now. - You must make a lot of money in this Muay Thai business. - Not compared to boxing, MMA, but-- - I don't understand, then. Why don't you do something more lucrative like MMA or like boxing? - Maybe he's just not good enough. - No, I mean I'm good enough. I just don't wanna do MMA or boxing. I like Muay Thai, I grew up with it. That's my martial art, and I love it. I mean, you guys love the law, right? That's why you do it, that's why you're in school? - Are you kidding me? I do it because of the money. - That's how, you guys all feel that way? - Pretty much. - I guess I just can't explain then why I love Muay Thai. You should come down to the gym. I'll give you a lesson. - I'm good, thank you. - I'll take a raincheck on that. - Maybe he's scared. - Maybe he's a dick. - I cannot believe the way Priscilla was acting. - Yeah, it wasn't really her, though, it was that one guy. - Sorry about that, I'm really embarrassed, and thank you for putting up with that. You handled it really well. - I'm gonna beat him up. - You're gonna beat him up? - Nah, I'm just gonna, your friends, they don't socialize outside their circle too much, do they? - I don't know, but they're not racist or anything, I swear, that's not what it is. - No, not racist, just snobbish. - Snobbish? - Yeah, snobs. - Well, lawyers. - All right, good job today class. Couple announcements, the jiu jitsu team, they won three out of five matches this weekend, so go ahead and give it up to them, all right, good job. You know how hard it is over there. Um, other announcements, I do have my fight comin' up. Title match, it's pretty cool, um, if you can, come on down. We're selling tickets at the front. Buy 'em here, it does help me. Other than that, that's it, hope to see you guys again, thank you for coming to my class. Shake hands with your partners and we're good. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Good luck on your match man. - All right thank you. How was it? - Man, hey, congratulations, dude, on gettin' a title fight. - Yeah, it's all right. - Hey, don't be so modest about it. - I just, I have a lot of training to do, you know, and I gotta lot of weight to cut, and that's just, I mean I'm hopin' I can do it, I don't know. I'm hopin', I'm hopin'. - Yeah, well congratulations, though, man. - Thank you, I appreciate it, I really appreciate that, I mean you're gonna come, right? Did you get your ticket? - Yeah, yeah, well you know, I gotta work, right? - Yeah. - but I'm gonna try my damnedest to get down here. - That's all I ask, man, just give it a shot. - I believe in you, Rick. I believe in you. Hey, so what about tomorrow evening, huh? - Tomorrow, what time do you get off, three or four? - Well, - same time? - Maybe between four and five? - Yeah, that's fine. - Six? - Six, you're pushin' it. - Six, I'll see you at 6:30, all right? Gimme some love. - All right, 6:00. (knocking on door) - It's open. - Hey hi, I'm Rick. - Hi, I'm Kathy, Danielle's mother. - Hi, I'm Rick, Danielle's boyfriend. - She's been waiting at the window for like 20 minutes. - We saw you pull up, but you weren't coming in. - I was getting changed in the car. I didn't wanna come in smelling like the gym. - Well uh, we're gonna go on a walk before dinner. - Oh, it's so nice to meet you, Rick, and I want you guys to have fun and I'll see you when you get back. - Okay. - All right? - Bye. - So how's your relationship with your parents again? - It's fine, why? - I was just asking. - Are you judging me? - I'm always judging you. - You can go home. - And then when do you start school? - I start on Tuesday. - You start on Tuesday? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, and it's like Tuesday Thursday classes, Monday Tuesday, just Tuesdays? - Monday through Friday. - That's a lot of school. Are you gonna be goin' to work too or are you gonna quit? - I'm not gonna quit, I'm gonna do it all. - Are you still gonna be able to hang out? - With you? - Yeah. - I guess so. - Can you, can you do a push up? I mean, or do you just sort of fall to the ground and hope somebody else'll pick you up? 'Cause I, I'm not judging. Not judging. - That's my husband for you. We're pretty easy to get along with once you get to know us. - I can definitely see where Danielle gets her personality from. - Well, I'm glad to hear that. She's a pretty good kid. - Mm-hmm. - I'm all right. - Are you sure you're okay with a salad? I'm really sorry, I wish I could have cooked more for you. - He's all right mom, don't worry about it. - But he's so thin, he needs to put some weight on. - Or not, I mean you can continue to eat something that looks like a raccoon left it behind in a bird feeder. The choice is yours. - Well, my husband used to be a fighter. - Is that so, what kind of fighting? - Uh, humans, humans, not fighting the discount bargain rack it seems like your shirt came off of. It's okay, Ricky, I mean, you can't win every fight, right, or maybe any of 'em. - [Danielle] Dad. - Cortez, Cortez was the best fighter, you gotta be kidding me, man. Right, Robinson? He didn't train for the fight. - Excuses, excuses-- - excuses two months. - All excuses man. - Two months? Two months to get ready for a fight? For a championship fight? You're outta your mind. - Hey, that's his fault. - Puchie, Puchie, tell 'em, bro. - Listen, listen, regardless. This guy could have had three months, six months, hell, a year, this guy doesn't compare, man. listen, Gold Tooth Robinson's the best there was, period. - I'm gonna tell you about Gold Tooth. Gold Tooth was a dancer, he danced, all right? Cortez stood in front, he boxed toe to toe, he didn't move. Mijo, am I right, am I right? - You just said the key word, boxed, k box. That's how you fight, that's how you win. You stick and move, it's whoever can hit and not get hit, bro, it's who's smarter. That's how boxing is won. - No man that's called dancing. - It's called boxing. - It's called dancing. The best fighter, pound for pound, Cortez, am I right mijo? - I don't know who Cortez is. - Man, this guy doesn't watch boxing, all he watches is Muay Thai. - Muay Thai, eh, that stuff was before my time. I mean, that was over in China when I was a youngster. - Thailand, pop. - Thailand, China, Japan, bro, it's all over there. - What's your name again? - Danielle. - Danielle, that's a boy's name, right? - [Man] Oh come on pop, come on man. - Come on, you know that was funny. - [Man] Don't let him talk to you that way. Don't let him bully you like that. - No, all kidding aside, you know this family, we come from a long line of warriors, that's right. I know you can't tell, but Puchie used to be in shape. - It's all the beers. - Yeah, after he got hurt. You know, though this family you can trace us all the way back to the Aztecs. I'm serious. - Hey, tell 'em about the Aztecs. - His great, great uncle, no this is a true story-- - Tell them, tell 'em about the Aztecs. - Anyways, what was it, like 400 years ago, 400 years ago our great, great grandfather used to fight in these fights. - The Muay Thai fights? - Muay Thai fights, you know what I'm talkin' about. - I'm being led away. - Yeah, my cousin Puchie, he was a great fighter, - Hi guys, - really in shape and stuff. - Here Danielle. - Oh, thanks. - You're welcome. - Here you go. - I can't, I can't eat most of this. - Why not? - It's starches and it's carbs. - One meal is not gonna hurt you. - I'm in fight camp, one meal is going to hurt me. - No it's not, look how skinny you are. You both look anorexic to me. - Let's not talk about it in front of-- - You do, though, honey you have to eat. - No. - You do. Women like guys with a little meat on 'em. Will you tell him, Danielle? - It's true, it makes us look smaller. - Don't agree with her, you're supposed to be agreeing with me. - No, I have to agree with your mom. - Mijo, it's true. - You know what, here. - What? - You can have that, we're both gonna go inside. - I'm staying with your mom. - Okay, she can stay with me. You can go inside. - We're gonna have a girl talk now. - You know what? One day I'm gonna gain like 200 pounds and you're both gonna have to deal with that. - That's cute, look at your cheeks. So, which one's this mysterious brother your mom was telling me about? - What did she tell you? - That you have a brother that you don't talk about, that you have not told me about. - It's 'cause he lives in L.A., it's far, what's the point? - It's still in California. - When was the last time you talked to him? - A few days ago. - A few days ago? - Yeah, I mean he calls, but we don't talk about nothin'. - You don't talk about nothin'? What does that even mean? - He calls me, he asks about my car, that's about it. - Yeah? What do you tell him about your car? That you should drive it to L.A. to go see him and invite him to your fight? Is he coming to your fight? - I don't even know if he's coming to my fight. I don't even know if he knows about it. - You should find out about that. He should be at your fight. - Mom, mom. - [Mama] What? - Does Bennie know about my fight? - [Mama] I don't know, did you tell him? - He doesn't know about my fight, just let it go. - No, let's call him, get your phone. Where is your phone, let's call him right now. - [Mama] Call him, it's up to you, you know. - Mama knows. - Oh my gosh, you broke her. - [Mama] Call him, go see him. - She's just bringin' the real me out. Let's go see him, I'll drive. We can get snacks, or I can get snacks. So what time are we supposed to meet your brother? - Six. - What are you guys gonna do? - Eat, maybe. - Eat, chill, bond. Bro talk. - Bro talk. - Yeah, what do you guys talk about? - We don't talk about a single thing. - You don't talk at all? - No, we have nothin' in common. - I'm sure, the weather, everyone can find something to talk about. - We're just gonna sit there, and that's it. We drive back. - Well, you better find something in common. Tell him how great I am. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I should tell him that you even exist. - He doesn't know about me, well. - What are you gonna do, you gonna be there with us? - No, you should have your time, I'm gonna go see a movie or something. - You sure? - Yeah. - You ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. - Let's go. - Put me down. - Hey, Ricky. - Hey, Bennie. - What time did you get here? - Five or 10 minutes ago. - How was traffic? - L.A. you know how it goes. What's up? - How's that car running? - Good, it's good. - You change the oil like I showed you? - Yeah. You talk to mom? - you headed back tonight? - Yeah, right after this. - What are you doin' down there? - Same, fighting, how about you, how's work? - 12 hour days. - Yeah. - Yep, need some money? - No, I'm good, I'm good, Bennie. - Here, just take it. You need some more, just ask, don't worry about it. - Thanks, Bennie. - All right, I'm gonna head back. - I'll put your plate, I'll walk out with you. - All right. - I'm gonna be late, I'm gonna be late. - You're not gonna be late, you're gonna be fine. - I'm already late. - I was always late to school. - And look where you are now. I'm out at three, okay? - At three, okay. Babe. - Yeah? - I love you. - I love you too. - Make some friends today at school. - Hey Ricky, can I talk to you a sec? - Yeah, what's up, Joe? - Are you comin' out? - What's goin' on, what's goin' on, Joe? - One of the members came to me with a rumor about Rudy. - Rumor about Rudy? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, I checked it out. Thing is, he's been bettin' on underground fights. Illegal fights in the city, he's been settin' 'em up and bettin' on 'em. You involved in these fights? - No. No. - You know he was makin' bets? - I didn't know. - All right. I have to let him go, 'cause I could lose my license, all right, and I know you were close to him. - He should be here right now, training, he's an idiot. - Hey, settle the fuck down, okay? The plan, the strategy, everything is still the fuckin' same. I talked to somebody last night, showed 'em the tapes. They know exactly how much you fuckin' suck on your inside game, so it's good. - Joe, I mean-- - hey, for you, it's the same thing. You can't get distracted by any of this shit. Fighting, gettin' better, Manny, that's all that should be on your mind, okay? - And these guys are gonna train me? - Yeah. - And they're good? - They're good, do you fuckin' trust me, they're good. All right? - Okay. - Okay, get back in there. (intense music) - And then afterwards she took me to get drinks, and we were just talking and she was giving me all these tips and tricks, and I don't know, it was amazing, it's just, I love it, you know? - Mm-hmm. - Am I boring you? - No, I'm proud of you. I'm just, my headache sucks. - Yeah, you're dehydrated. - Mm-hmm. - So what are you down to now? - 163. - Do you think you're gonna make it in time? - Yeah, I'll be good. - Wanna get some sleep? - Mm-hmm. - Tell us, how did you put this fight together, man? Tell the people at home a little about what's goin' on here today. - Well, you know, it's all God's work to me.

You go out there and do your best. I'm gonna be out there rootin' for you, all right? - You're not doin' it for him, or me, you're doin' it for you. - I'm sittin' here with my man Mason Drew. Mason, how do you see this fight playin' out? - I see it in Ricky's favor. I know Manny has the better record, but that guy Ricky's a strong fighter. - Representing the School of Koa, the number one contender, Ricky the tiger Torres.

Check it out, I'm gonna bring Louis along on Thursday night, too. - This is great, I'm really excited about hosting his first fight. - Yeah, he's excited too. - Good. So Ricky, how long's he been in? - That's the thing, it's been about five weeks now. - That long, huh? - Yeah. - Wow, he's a good kid, just needs a little more time. - Yeah, I know, it just hasn't been the same without him here, you know? - Yeah, I know. So Thursday? - Thursday night. I'll have him ready. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. - Fantastic. - All right, let's go. - Welcome, Ricky, to the Morning Crane Healing Art Center, what brings you here today? - I twisted my left ankle. - And how long ago did you do this? - It was about a month ago. - About a month ago, okay. So you don't know if there's any fracture in there or anything? - No, I don't-- - don't think there's a fracture? - I don't feel anything like bone, just kind of feels like a normal sprain. So there's definitely blockage there? - Yeah, we're starting to see it on the skin now. - Oh my god. - Okay, I'll get as much as I can. - Now in this previously stated statement, Mr. Wilkins denied my client from even being employed. Now these pay stubs and testimonies from co-workers prove that to be false. - This is bullshit, man. I meant it to be different and you know that. - Mr. Wilkins. - Let me handle this. - Mr. Wilkins, you will have your chance to speak, but for now please refrain from outbursting. - May I continue? - Proceed. - Now with these documents I call to move forward with judgment with no further delays or, or to schedule trial. - At this time I will let the accused party rebuttal. - Uh, Your Honor, one moment please. Your Honor, we'd like to request for a recess and I highly suggest that we settle this out of court. - Excuse me? I ain't afraid of these bitches, man. Her, her, or her, they don't fuckin' scare me, man. We got this, I'm innocent here, yo. - Mr. Wilkins. - Would you knock it off? - Let me see this. - I highly suggest you listen to your attorney, Mr. Wilkins. - I see what this is here. This is some kind of woman's movement, huh? Just because I'm a man, you guys think you can gang up on me and come down on me, right? That's what it's all about, right? Come on, speak up, man, you're my attorney. - Let me handle this. - Just go. - Okay, here we go. We settle this out of court. - Well, at this point it looks like we won. So all we need to do is just wait for the lawyer to call us with the settlement. - I'm really happy for Georgia. - I know, it feels good, doesn't it? - Yeah, I can see why you do this, why you fight for the little guy instead of those big corporations. - Yes, and I'm sure this is why you're gonna be doin' it like this too. Now see, Georgia didn't have a lot of money to pay us up front, but that doesn't mean she didn't deserve justice. One more thing, next time you come to court with me you've gotta leave the pirate shirt at home. I need your hair pulled back in a bun and I need a suit, okay? - Okay. - This is the big leagues now, but you did good. - Thanks. - Gimme five. - Big leagues. - Big leagues. - Look at those stuck up bitches. Think they're so smart, making me feel like an idiot in there. (car crashing into object) (heart monitor beeping) - She suffered a lot of swelling in the brain. We had to go in and relieve some of the pressure caused by the trauma. She's in critical condition, but stable nonetheless. At this point all we can do is be by her side while she fights. I'm sorry. - Thank you, Doctor. - Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah, I'm just takin' everything in. - Listen, I've been doin' this a long time, and I've seen people come in and out of here every day. Accidents happen, so if you're blaming yourself you need to stop, it's not helpin' anyone. You need to be strong for her. All right? - Thank you, Doctor. - [Nurse] Dr. Graham? - Are those the parents of the patient? - Yeah, yeah. - What's up, buddy? - My name is Jolene, I'm from the billing department. I understand this is a rough time-- - It's fine, what can I do for you? - Well, what I have here is information regarding her care here. Insurance will cover most of her expenses but not all, so the amount here is what is owed after insurance is deducted. - When does all of that need to be paid? - Since we don't know how long she'll be staying here we've broken it down to monthly payments. - What happens if the payments don't come in? - She would be moved to another facility. I believe she's being treated with the best medical care in the state, but a lot of the equipment and surgeries performed would be considered optional by insurance. I do think this is the best for her, but I understand that this is-- - It's okay, it's okay, the payments will come in. Thank you, Jolene. - Thank you. - You know how these contracts go, I mean their next event is not till September. I mean, I can get you on the card, Ricky, but I don't know if you're gonna be ready, I mean, I don't know if you're in the right mindset for this. Maybe, maybe it's time to take a break. - I can't take a break, I don't wanna take a break, Joe. I wanna fight and I need to do somethin', and all I know how to do is fight. That's all I know how to do. - All right, we can try to work somethin' out. I mean, everybody here, we're family, Ricky. We just wanna help. You goin' to the hospital? - Yeah. - Wanna lift? - That'd be great. - Come on. - You hangin' in there? - Can I ask you somethin' personal? - Sure. - Do you think she can hear us? I mean I know she's not conscious or anything, but-- - I like to think they can. I like to think they can hear us, feel us, and just being here helps them recover. Don't lose hope, okay? - Thank you. I'm not very good at this. It's hard, you know, seein' you this way. There's nothing I want more than for you to be here with me right now. I miss you, I miss you every day. Jab, hook, hook, uppercut, all right. - Well, it looks like her vitals are stable. I know you've done everything for her to be here, it's not in vain. - I'm sorry, we've been living modestly, off the grid for so long. If we had more money, I would, - It's gonna be okay. - Hey, hey doc, um can I talk to you for a sec? - Yeah, sure. - Hey, my name's Joe, I'm Ricky's fight coach. - Nice to meet you. - I just wanted to, I just wanted to thank you and everybody here for everything you're doing for this girl. - Of course. - Thing is, I know this kid, he's a good kid. He loves this girl. He wants to build a life with her and I kind of want that for him too, but I don't want him to have to go on fightin' all his life. I want him to have a family. I guess I don't want him to end up like me. So you gotta save her, okay, please, you gotta save her. - Listen to me very carefully, we are doin' everything we can. She's a fighter, just like him. You should be proud. - I am, thank you. - Hey, what's up Hunter? - How you doin', Luis? - Don't look like you're here for trainin'? - Nah, not today, this is my partner. - Will. - Luis, nice to meet you. - So is Rick around? - Yeah, man, he's in the back. You want me to go get him? - No, no, no, we'll just go surprise him. We just need to talk to him. Remember about that thing we talked about, right? - Yeah, I remember, man. - What's goin' on? - This is my partner. - Hey, Will. - Rick. - Nice to meet you. - Look, we just wanted you to know that we caught the person we've been lookin' for, he's sittin' right now in a jail cell while his people are tryin' to like buy, or get a lawyer. Look, I know this isn't gonna ease your mind, man, but I just wanted you to know that we caught that scumbag. - Where, where is he now? - We've got him down at county jail. - County? - That's right. Look, are you okay, man? Now I know how you feel. You fine? - I'm fine. - all right. - I'm all right. - Look man, I'm so sorry that this happened this way. - Yeah. I know, thank you, thank you. - We gotta roll. - Okay, you take care of yourself, and I'll see you next class. I'm gonna bring Will with me. - Yeah. Yeah. (melancholy music) - I'm headed to the hospital, I'll be back later. - Hey, sit down. Sit down, grab somethin' to eat, sit down. Gimme a second, sit down. Grab somethin' to eat. - I'm not hungry. - Well, it's not about being hungry, it's about eating, you gotta take care of yourself, I mean you're the one that told me, right, if you eat right you think better? Just grab a bite. - I'll eat later, will that make you happy? - It's not about making me happy. It's about you taking care of yourself. - I gotta lot goin' on right now, okay? I don't have time to think about everything. - Yeah, we'll talk later. - Is that right? Joe was not happy about what he just found out. No, he wasn't supposed to find out, are you kiddin' me? No, it's business with him, so I completely understand. Freakin' Rick gave me a freakin' call, and shit. Oh man, you know what, lemme call you back. Yeah, so let me call you back, all right? Okay. Shit, Ricky, what are you doin' here, man? I mean, look, you should be learning through what I'm goin' through right now. It's not an easy situation, you understand? So I, I, I understand what you're goin' through, but do you really wanna take on this path? - How much can I make per fight? - Rick, this is dirty money, man. This is dirty money, okay, I don't wish this upon you. I wish things were different with this. Are you sure you wanna go ahead-- - When can you set it up? - The next one's in two and a half weeks. - Set it up. - All right. Okay. Ricky, fuck, man, I'm sorry about Danielle, man. I wish things were different. - Hey, what's up, Rick? How you holdin' up, bro? You good, man? So what you been up to, man? - I went to go see Rudy. - You what? - Just now, just came back from there. - For what, man? - I need money. - Rick, Rick, Rick, look man, Rudy's your boy, and that's my boy too, but what he did, that was his decision. That's below you, dog. All right, but that's not you, man, I'm not gonna see you go out like that, okay? So I'm gonna need you to be serious, okay? - I am serious, man. This is a serious fuckin' matter. - Rick, I understand how you feel, all right, but you're just gonna risk it all? Is that what you're gonna do? - She is all, man, I got nothin' else. - I understand that. - I got nothin' else man, I'm goin'. - Rick. - Do you know how it's been? What my daily life is? Seein' her layin' down in the hospital? - So what, man, you just gonna throw it all away? - Man-- - Man, I look up to you, man. This used to be everything to you and you gonna throw it all away? No, man, I'm not havin' that. - I know what I'm doin'. I know it's fuckin' awful. I know who he is and what he does. But I gotta do somethin'. - Dude, I know what you lost, man, and right now you're desperate, all right? But you my boy, man, I'm not about to go in there and lay my head on that pillow and know what you're out there doin'. I'm not gonna let you go out like that, man. Look, I know you miss her, she's layin' up in there, nobody wants to see her like that. - I can't lose her. What am I supposed to do if she dies? - I know, I know, I know. I got you, man, you my boy, all right? We're in this together. - Hey Joe, think I can speak to you for a moment? - Yeah, sure, what's up? - Yesterday after I left work I, sorry, sorry about that. It's a message from the hospital. - What does it say? - It just says for me to go there. - You want a ride? - Yeah, that'd be fine, thank you. Thank you. - If you guys need someone to talk to we have a chaplain available, I'd be glad to have someone bring him down, or take you guys somewhere private. - What's goin' on? - Mr. Torres. - What's goin' on? - There were complications. Her brain swelling took a turn for the worse. - Oh Ricky, she's gone. - I'm sorry, we've done everything we could do. (clock ticking) - How you doin'? You need to eat something, I cooked something. Would you like dinner? - No, I'm not hungry. - Come on, you need to eat. - I wanna watch TV. - I'm gonna have your dad talk to you. - What's up? - Did you go train today? - I hadda teach. - Yeah. - 4:30 5:30 kids. - Those little guys. - Yeah, goin' crazy. - You have patience, I've seen you work with those kids. It takes a lot of patience, I wouldn't be able to do it. - It's fun. - So, let me ask you something. Are you gonna fight again? - I don't, I don't think so. I don't feel like I need to any more, you know? - Yeah, but you never needed to, you always, you wanted to. It's a passion you had. - I don't think I want to any more, you know? I don't really know what I'm supposed to do. Will you tell me what to do and I'll do it? - Can't tell you what to do, I can't, son. This has gotta come from you, it's gotta come from your heart. I know you're hurt right now, I know you're feeling pain. I've been there. I think about your grandma every day. I lost my brothers, you know that, and I lost friends. But you gotta move on. You gotta move on, you gotta think about the memories you have with the people. And it's just life, you just never know when someone's gonna go, and that's why it kills me to see the way you and your brother treat each other sometimes. You know, I love you guys, I would do anything for you guys, and I know it's not easy, but you have us here, yeah, don't go through it alone. I love you, you're my boy, you're strong. I love you kid. (melancholy music) - Your strengths, you strike him on the outside, right? Hi Ricky. - Hey. - You teachin' class today? - Yeah, 4:30 to 5:30 kids. - Those kids are a handful now, Ricky, you want any help? - No, I'm okay. - Okay. Hey, Ricky. - Yeah? - Good to have you back. - Thanks guys, see ya. (melancholy music
