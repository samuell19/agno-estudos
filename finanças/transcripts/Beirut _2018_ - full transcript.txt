(MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC PLAYING) - MASON: For 4,000 years... - (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) ...villains and heroes, we don't do that here. Here you have Jews, Muslims, Christians, all living shoulder to shoulder and it's messy. And the challenge for the State Department, for all of us... MAN #1: (LAUGHS) Sounds like I'm not gonna get a quick answer to my question. MAN #2: Mason's just playing the diplomat, Congressman. MASON:Yeah. MAN #2: He's been here long enough to explain this place in a minute if he has to. MAN #1: If there's a shorter version, let's have at it, Mr. Skiles. Just give me the snapshot. MASON: Okay, I don't know if I'd call it a snapshot, but, um... I like to tell people if you want to understand Lebanon, think of a boarding house without a landlord. Okay? And the only thing that the tenants have in common is their talent for betrayal. So these people have been living together, cheek-by-jowl, for 20 centuries. Two thousand years of revenge, blood feuds, vendetta, murder. One night there's a storm. Raining like all hell. There's a knock at the door. Who is it? It's the Palestinians. They want in. They've been up and down the block, doors slammed in their face. They're cold, they're tired. They want in and they want in now. So the house is thrown into confusion. Tenants arguing. Some of them violently opposed. Some of them think, "Let 'em in, they'll be gone by tomorrow morning." Some of 'em think, "If I let them in tonight, "then I'll have an ally against my enemy down the hall." Some of them are terrified as to what happens if they keep the door shut. So it isn't until after the Palestinians move in, that the other people in the house realize the tragedy of the situation. That the Palestinians want nothing more than to just burn down the Israeli house next door. Welcome to Beirut. (LAUGHTER) MAN #2: See, I told you he was good, huh? - MAN #1: Sure is. - MASON: And so it goes. - WOMAN: Mr. Skiles. - (BLOWS KISS) Ça va? How are you? - Lovely. - Ça va? Ça va bien? You look beautiful. You guys look great. MASON:Mason Skiles. How do you do? We have not met. How do you do? Nice to see you again. MASON: We know who we don't wanna make deals with at this point. And the lessons of Vietnam have been learned, and I think our president got his own things on the domestic front to deal with as well. But I think what we definitely don't want to do is establish any sort of, uh, permanent presence. - Where are you from? - I'm from Washington, DC. Washington, DC? Well, good for you. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Here we are. (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) We understand that Beirut specifically, Lebanon more generally, has enough people coming in and trying to put fingerprints on it. We don't wanna be another one of those people. We just wanna make sure everybody has a fair playing ground to contribute to a stable, you know, regional economy. That's what I think. (LAUGHS) The congressman, I think, can certainly speak more to that. Karim, this is, uh, some friends of ours. This is Angus and Joanna. They're from the United Kingdom. Karim's been keeping everybody well fed. - Good job. - KARIM: Thank you. (LAUGHS) - WOMAN: How old is he? He looks very young. He's about 13. He's from one of the Palestinian refugee camps in West Beirut. Uh, he's kind of stuck around and he's become a bit of... Part of the family, which is very nice. - This is my lovely wife, Nadia. - Nice to meet you. MASON: I think you know the congressman. How are you enjoying life in Beirut? Well, we've been having a very nice time in Beirut, in fact. I happen to find it a beautiful place, full of beautiful people. - NADIA: Yes. - MASON: Yes. One... One beautiful person in particular. (LAUGHS) Well, look, as a diplomat in the Middle East right now, you have to learn to think on your feet. And the more you do it, the better you get at it. Uh, when you talk about making deals with people, the most important thing to do is to keep talking. And as soon as the talking stops, then the fighting starts. We need to come in, from a diplomatic standpoint, and explain to everybody involved, "This is what we have to work with. "These are the pieces on the game board right now." Thank you for being here. I'm gonna leave you in very capable hands here, okay? I've gotta say hi to somebody. Thanks so much. Good to see you. Alice. Alice, all alone? (CHUCKLES) I heard you had congressmen. (CHUCKLES) You know how that drives me wild. Where is Cal? I could use a hand here. Oh, he's coming. Just something at the office. Everyone behaving themselves? It's early. (GIGGLES) - Come on, let's get you a drink. - Hungry? - Famished. (IN ARABIC) MASON: Mmm-mmm-mmm. (IN ENGLISH) How are we doing? Good. We've got Christians in one corner, Muslims in the other corner, and Jack Daniel's in between. Dinner's close. Everyone here? Cal's running late, but Alice said we should start without him. (SIGHS) How are you, sweetie? (SIGHS) My next life? - In your next life, you marry a carpenter. - Mmm. (CHUCKLES) - (WOMAN SPEAKING ARABIC IN DISTANCE) (EXCLAIMS) (NADIA SPEAKING ARABIC) MASON: (IN ENGLISH) Where you been hiding? Who, the drivers? Clean you out? (IN ARABIC) - (GIGGLES) - (IN ENGLISH) Bingo. Let's get you reloaded and back out there. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (UPBEAT FRENCH SONG PLAYING) CAL: Hello, hello. - Hey, sweetie. - Hey, how are you? - Have you seen Mason? - You look tense. No, no, no, just want to talk to Mason for a second, that's all. - What's wrong? - Nothing, I just, uh... Oh, hello, Karim. Look at you. Don't you look elegant. Don't you think so, Cal? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, very elegant. I understand congratulations are in order. Nadia told me you did really well on your exams. She helped me a lot. But she's not the one who took the test though, is she? You heard about this, right? Cal? Yeah, very impressive. Uh, excuse me, I'm just gonna... (CHUCKLES) Hey, there you are. I was having a nightmare I was gonna have to babysit these yahoos by myself. - We need to talk. - You need a drink. Nothing like mingling with a bunch of congressmen to make you lose faith in democracy. Indeed. We need to talk. Mace, we've been through a lot together, right? And somehow, through all of it, we've managed to steer around the icebergs. - No, thank you. - Come on, Cal, spit it out. I've got 25 people out there waiting for dinner. Look, I've never come to you with anything operational. We've always been clean. What the fuck are we talking about? Karim. It's about Karim. They want him for questioning. - Who wants him? - Everybody. - He's got a brother. Did you know that? - What? No, he's got no one. He... Why do you think Nadia took him in? I mean... Rafid Abu Rajal. They were separated in '68. Karim came here to Beirut. Rafid went to prison for two years in Jordan. Hold on. (GLASS THUDS) Where's this going? Munich. The brother left a rental car outside the Olympic Village. They've got prints. They've got a witness. They've got this, Mace. That's Karim and his brother. Six months ago, here in Beirut. They who? There's an operations supervisor waiting for you at the bottom of the driveway. - They want him now. - No. They who? Mossad? Mason, I can help you. I can't make this go away. Okay, so it is Mossad. So Israel just drops a dime and you guys just jump up? - Hey, come on. Your people are all over this. - This is bullshit. Hey, the State Department froze your security access two hours ago! Okay? Someone talked, it leaked. It's... It's... It's... It's gotta be now. It's not safe. Come on, Cal, it's Karim, for fuck's sake! You've got the kid brother of global enemy number one - serving canapés to fucking congressmen! - What are you... What are you gonna do? You wanna drag him outta here? You think Nadia's gonna go for that? Jesus, she just filed papers for his sponsorship. We just got him a student visa, for Christ's sakes! (SIGHS) He's part of the family, Cal! Not my call. Okay. You go tell your boss I'll be down to talk to him in five minutes. Yeah. MASON: Karim, I need you to be honest with me, okay? If you lie to me, if you hang me up, I cannot help you. Your brother. (GASPS) (SIGHS) - Is he dead? - When is the last time you saw him? He's not dead. He's not dead, okay? Karim, I just need you to answer my question. When did you see him last? Six months where? He come... He comes to you where? On... On the street? He's here? He's here on the street in Beirut? Why would you lie to me about this? Why? (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) Okay, okay, okay. I'm... I'm not mad at you. I'm not mad at you. I'm not mad at you, okay? I just need you to tell me the truth. Okay? NADIA: What's going on out here? (MASON SIGHS) Go, now. Go to the kitchen. Wait there. What did he do? I don't know. Nothing, maybe. Nothing. I don't know. I need to handle this. I need you to go back inside and make sure dinner gets out in time, okay? I'll be back in a few minutes. - This is bad, isn't it? - It's nothing that can't be fixed. All right? NADIA: Karim. (IN FRENCH) MASON: (IN ENGLISH) Listen to me. I can promise you I will have him there. I guarantee it. I'll have him there first thing in the morning at the embassy. - I'm offering you a compromise here. - I'm sorry, Mr. Skiles. I don't have the authority to negotiate on this. Well, listen, that's a very tough spot to be in. I know, I've been in that spot many times myself. There's no reason why this can't run smoothly. I just don't see that happening. Does he know the situation here? Yeah, I've explained it. Mr. Riley is not here this evening in a supervisory capacity. We thought he might be able to get the man out quietly. - That hasn't happened. - "Man"? This is a 13-year-old boy we're talking about! Hold on. This child is harmless. This is not an analysis assignment. Okay, listen to me. If you can't help me find a creative solution to my problem here, then I'm gonna ask you to get on the telephone and find someone who can. I'm afraid, Mr. Skiles, that we've lost that as an option. Then I suggest you retrace your fucking steps and figure out where you lost... - (GUNFIRE) - (PEOPLE SCREAMING) JONES: Jesus! Get him! Get him! CAL: Wait, Mace! Mason! Hold it! (GUNFIRE) Watch out! Watch out! KARIM: Mason! Nadia! Nadia! Nadia! Help me! Karim! Nadia! (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) Nadia! Help me, Mason! (SPEAKING ARABIC) KARIM: Mason! - (IN ARABIC) - No! (IN ENGLISH) No! Mason! (GROANS) (VAN DOOR CLOSING) Karim! (IN ARABIC) - (SPEAKING ARABIC) - NADIA: Mason! NADIA: Mason. (NADIA GROANS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (IN ENGLISH) Don't leave me. No, no, no. No, no. No, baby. Stay, stay, stay. WOMAN: (ON RADIO) Don't leave home without that raincoat this morning. You are going to need it. Showers will continue in the Boston area throughout the early evening, tapering off just after rush hour. And that's your traffic and weather on WBCN. It's 7:15. I'm Jane Emerson. Coming up in the next half hour, Jerry Corbin discusses the future of Boston's Big Dig with Assemblywoman Karen Corona. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) MAN: Hey, buddy! You all right in there? Yes. Yes, sir. You don't sound so sure. Coming or going? (STAMMERS) No, I'm here. I'm a guest at the hotel. I was just heading in. All right. Try sleeping inside. (SIGHS) MASON: All right, issue number five. Pension/attrition ratio. We worked our way to common ground here. Jerry's gonna accept the National Formula, and the union has decided to waive their "most favored nations" clause. Great. Number six. ICC indemnity bonding. Feels like another solid compromise here. Gonna cross-collateralize the insurance premiums with the safety bonuses. So we have fewer accidents, we have fewer claims, we have a better package. Everybody wins. All right, guys. That is six issues we've taken off the table. I think it's important right now to take a look back and realize how far we've come. Six of ten. Of nine. You see? You're back with the overtime? Again with this? It's never going on the table. Fine. Look, guys. Both sides have to show more cards here, all right? The numbers are gonna tell us which way we're gonna go with this. I'm getting raped here, Mason. - Prove it! Open your books! - Open your fucking ears! I'm done. I'm going back to the office and starting over. What do you mean by "starting over"? I'm going back to my original offer. - DENNIS: Is that a threat, Jerry? - No. Here's a threat. I'm gonna start answering my phone 'cause it's ringing off the hook with guys who would kill to work for what I paid you thieves 20 years ago! DENNIS: You don't got the balls to lock us out! Okay. Uh, let's take a break. - JERRY: Try me! - I can have a strike vote in 15 minutes! - Bring it on! - I'm gonna fucking bring it on! JERRY: Let's see this strike! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) DENNIS: Fuck you, you piece of fuckin'... You know what? Kiss my fuckin' fat ass! ERNIE: Well, that went well. MASON: They'll cool off. The deal speaks for itself. I mean, let 'em sit with it a little bit, let the downside ring in their ears. In a couple days, they'll be back. Where do we stand with the supermarket thing in, uh, Providence? They took a local guy. A lawyer. I was gonna tell you this morning, but it seemed like you had a lot on your plate. Buy you a drink at Foleys? I've been offered another job. It's New York. We're still haggling over the numbers, but, uh... That's not why I want to wrap things up. I'm not bailing on you. You need a rest, Mace. Like, for real. Get some sun. Walk around. Take a break. You're gonna do great in New York, Ernie. You'll be fine. (ELEVATOR DINGS) Colonel Ruzak. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) It's confirmed. They found the car. - Pack your bag. - It's in my office, sir. (COUNTRY ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) MAN: Mason? Mason Skiles? You might not remember me. Ray Sullivan? Sure. You arbitrated a barter for us a couple years back. Uh, fiber optics project down in Needham. - Sully. Of course. Of course. - (LAUGHS) How are you? I'm sorry. Relax. Happens to me 10 times a day. Who can keep track? Yeah, we're just here negotiating a labor settlement. Uh, just kind of killing time while both sides cool down a little bit. I know. I spoke to your partner. He told me you might be here. I got a wake-up call this morning. Kind of a fire alarm. Friends in Washington. Old friends. Well, mutual friends. They know I'm in the area and they, uh, asked me to hustle out and talk to you. American University in Beirut. I guess they had someone lined up to give a lecture later this week and he canceled on them. "Cross Cultural Arbitration" was the topic. So my friends, your credentials, you being alumni and all, they were hoping you might be able to fill in. There's a check. $6,500 and a first-class ticket. I wouldn't go back to Beirut if it was the last place on Earth. The flight leaves Logan at 8:45 tonight. Well, it sounds like you've got about six hours to find somebody else. I was told that's not an option. Look... I have no idea what's happening here. It'd be a hell of a lot easier for both of us if I did, but... I was told to tell you that, uh, time is extremely tight, and the Agency would be deeply grateful for your cooperation. It's a serious request, Mason. They know that. Tell 'em I don't have a passport. They put one in there with the ticket. Great seeing you, Ray. Do me a favor, will you? You miss the flight, this never happened. (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) ERNIE: Okay, this is the last message I'm leaving, Mace, because this is bullshit. Dennis called a strike about an hour ago. Maybe you know that, I don't know. I'm in New York. Pam has my keys. I don't know what else to say. You want to talk, you know where to find me. (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) WOMAN: Mason Francis Skiles. Forty-five years old. Post grad at Oxford in Arabic and Mideast Studies. Comes here in 1962 on a teaching fellowship. He's recruited Foreign Services in '63 for immediate posting to Cairo, then Damascus '65, Tel Aviv '68. 1969, he's reassigned to DC as Assistant Undersecretary for Mideast Affairs. He marries, he's published, he's widely quoted. Kissinger takes a shine to him, throws him a working group at the Paris Peace Talks. And then '71, he jumps the line. He comes back to Beirut, where he was appointed Deputy Chief of Mission here. And his wife, well, I guess Don ran that by you on the ride in. The incident at Skiles' house here in '72. His wife and the Abu Rajal brothers? I can read, Ms. Crowder. What I need to know is where he stands now. (FLIGHT ATTENDANT SPEAKS FRENCH ON PA) CROWDER: Well, he left Beirut in '73 before the civil war kicked in. He was the senior trade negotiator for the Boston Merchandising Council, then he left there three years ago to go private. And now he just has this small two-man firm. Mostly local labor issues. (SIGHS) So, from Kissinger to the crapper. CROWDER: Mmm-hmm. He has a drinking problem. RUZAK: Christ. How bad? CROWDER: They had to pour him onto the plane. Think we've got time for this nonsense? Talk to me, Don. Well, he's damaged goods. A frontrunner who stumbled. But he's manageable. RUZAK: Frank? You knew him when. Don't play cards with him, Gary. (SIGHS) (HORNS HONKING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Take it easy. MAN: Mr. Skiles! Mr. Skiles! Bernard Teppler, American University. Pleasure to have you. Absolute pleasure. Let me take you... - (GUNSHOTS) - (WOMAN SCREAMS) - (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) - (WOMAN CONTINUES SCREAMING) Welcome to Beirut. We're all thrilled to have you here, of course. Let me take that for you. TEPPLER: I'll be your liaison at the university while you're here, get you where you need to get. Beirut's changed quite a bit in the past 10 years, you'll find, Mr. Skiles. You missed quite the civil war. My itinerary says I'm staying at the L'Admiral Hotel. Yes, indeed. We booked you the deluxe suite. On the shelling side, I'm afraid. The beach side was full. Why aren't we taking Rue du Nabil? It's faster. Rue du Nabil's not good today. Big car bomb last night. Many people killed. Who lit that fuse? TEPPLER: (LAUGHS) Well, it's Beirut, Mr. Skiles. Depends who you ask. PLO says it's Amal militia. Amal militia says it's Christian militia. Christian militia says it's the Druze. Druze says it's the Syrian Army. Listen to the radio from Damascus, they'll tell you it's the Israelis making excuses to come across the border. Ask Israel? For them it's always the PLO. Not the PLO. My wife says it was Gamaeet El Cheea. What do you say? DRIVER: I say we skip Rue du Nabil. (KIDS SHOUTING) (HORN HONKING) Uh, they're checking papers, sir. TEPPLER: Oh, fuck it. I'm afraid I'm gonna need your passport. Nothing to worry about. PLO run a decent checkpoint. - Passport. - Hold on. TEPPLER: Welcome to the Green Line. This road divides East and West Beirut now. One of the civil war's charming new landmarks. Muslims to the West. Christians to the East. Not much room for the rest of us, but there you have it. Thank you, thank you so much. (REGGAE MUSIC CONTINUES) (KIDS CHATTING INDISTINCTLY) (EXHALES) MASON: Shit. (SIGHS) (EXHALES HEAVILY) Monsieur. S'il vous plaît? (SIGHS HEAVILY) CROWDER: Mr. Skiles? Mr. Skiles? Hi. I'm Sandy Crowder. I'm the Deputy Cultural Attaché at the embassy. So nice to meet you. - Hi. - What a surprise. I help out at the university sometimes, and they told me you were here for the lecture, so... - I know you just got in... - Oh, uh... Yeah, no, I just... Please, please. No, I left my car out front. Perhaps you'd like to get out of the hotel. (CHUCKLES) Oh, you know what? Uh, that's so funny. I was just thinking how much I could use a tour guide. - Really? - No. So why don't we stand here and pretend while you tell me what kind of trouble I've gotten myself into? (CHUCKLES) The Ambassador's hosting a recital this evening and I was thinking of stopping in. Okay, you're just gonna keep smiling at me no matter what I say, right? Why don't I meet you out front? (PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Good God. - Mason. - Ambassador Whalen. Shocking, I'm sure. (BOTH LAUGHING) Good seeing you, Frank. I seriously doubt that, but I... I appreciate the effort. Congratulations on all this. WHALEN: Ha! Now I know you're fucking with me. Why don't you go and find Don? We'll be right up. - Uh, flight good? - Good enough. WHALEN: You get a look around when you came in? - Yeah, what's left of it. - Breaks your heart, right? I tell you, Mason, you missed one hell of a fight. The PLO started tossing bombs, government pushed back. Israel got involved. And what do we get? Fifty thousand dead. City carved up like a goddamn pizza. And the PLO? They're still here. Hoping the ceasefire holds. 'Cause now we've got Israel down the road licking their chops, looking for an excuse to drive up and show us what great weapons we got 'em. Mason Skiles, uh, Colonel Gary Ruzak. - Nice to see you. - National Security Council. How you doing? - Um, thirsty? - Sure. Sure. Uh, bourbon, neat. Before we get started, I want you to know we all, all of us, are keenly aware of what you've done. And what is that? Coming out here. No notice, no info. It's... It's been duly noted. WHALEN: I think you know Don Gaines. Our Chief Political Officer here. - Been a while. - Long time. Here you go. Have a seat. (ALL CLEARING THROATS) Okay. MASON: Wow. Two spies, the White House, and an Ambassador. Maybe one of you can actually tell me what I'm doing here. Have you talked to anybody in the area recently? No. GAINES: You have a lot of friends here. You must keep in touch with someone, no? - No. - No phone calls? Christmas cards? Where are we going with this? GAINES: It's a simple question. Who's in charge here? We all serve the President. All right, well, unless he's the next one to pop through that door, why don't you step up and tell me what the fuck's going on? Three nights ago, an American was pulled off the street in West Beirut. The next morning, we got a communiqué from a group calling itself the Militia of Islamic Liberation. Very clean. No rhetoric. They have the guy, they wanna talk. They want you to broker the deal. They asked for you specifically. - Who would do that? - WHALEN: We know who it's not. It's not mainstream PLO. - That's a minority opinion. - WHALEN: Oh, come on, Gary. The last thing they want is Israeli tanks rolling across the border. They're not gonna risk something like this. Right now we're not ruling out anyone. Everything is in play. (STUTTERS) What is it you want me to do? You're an experienced negotiator. Negotiate. Come on, I'm here because some lunatic pulled my name out of a hat. Look, your kidnappers clearly want to make a deal. They got back fast. They're responsive. They're specific. You... You clearly have something that they want. So call their bluff. Tell them I'm out. Let the downside of that ring in their ear for a little while. If they bite, great. You have your first concession. (SCOFFS) Honest to God, I'm a little surprised. I thought I'd be seeing Cal here tonight. Cal Riley? Cal's the hostage. GAINES: You guys were pretty close. When's the last time you talked to him? Jesus. Uh... Ten years ago? I... GAINES: Radio silence? Nothing? Yeah, no. Yeah. CROWDER: We believe Cal requested you. Based on what? - Nothing specific, but... - No, no, no, no, no. No, I don't see that happening. Cal's my CO. We run half the Agency's Mideast operation off this desk. Do you understand what that means? Yeah. You're afraid he'll talk. - Afraid? - He's been here 13 years. The guy's a walking playbook. At the moment, nothing's blown. RUZAK: That we know of. This thing goes bad, we don't even know where to begin wrapping shit up. Right now we're just playing the waiting game. It's their move. RUZAK: So the question I need answered from you right now is... Can we count on you to play along until we get our feet on the ground? GAINES: So here's our story. We never mention Cal. He's on assignment, and nobody needs to know. Gary Ruzak doesn't arrive into Beirut till tomorrow, so you've never met him. Brought you up here tonight 'cause we heard you were in town and wanted to find out what the hell you were doing. MASON: This isn't really my thing, Gaines. GAINES: Sure it is, Mason. It's Texas Hold 'Em. Two cards down and everything else is on the table. Just play the reality. You're a confused 40-year-old widower in the middle of a long winter. You're pretending you're here to give a lecture, but truth is, you don't really know what you're doing or why you came. Reality. Your name appears out of nowhere and we get real nervous. Reality. We roll you up for a look and you resent our interest. Reality. So I'm leaving here pissed off? Works for me. What about Ms. Crowder? Well, it's a widely-held belief that dangling a skirt in front of a jet-lagged American man of your age is a high-percentage play. (DOOR OPENS) - Are we done here? - You suddenly became really important. Is that a mistake? I don't know. Reality. CROWDER: Gaines was just testing you. Everyone's under a lot of pressure. Well, isn't that what you're after? What's that supposed to mean? You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the action, right? Right. You think I'm here for the thrills? I don't know. No, you don't. All right, fine. Enlighten me. What's your story, Ms. Crowder? I'm a skirt in a car, driving an irritated tourist back to his hotel. (CHUCKLES) Hey, can we take a quick detour? To where? MASON: I'm gonna show you where I used to live. CROWDER: Wow. The PLO had a transmitter up here. Ten months ago, just before the cease-fire, the Israelis took it out. It must've been beautiful. It sure was. In every way. Ski in the morning, swim in the afternoon, party all night? No, not just that. All we were doing was what we wanted to do. We were happy. Not sure how that turned into this. - Hmm? - I'm good. Cal still with Alice? As far as I know. Yeah. - So where's she? - They have an apartment in Athens. Alice moved there with the family when the fighting started. Cal stayed in Beirut. It's impossible with kids here. - She knows I'm involved? - I'm not sure Gaines has told her yet. - We should head out. - Hold on, wait. Wait. What's your take on all this? Honestly. Do you think they want to save Cal, or do you think they want to save the information? - That's an ugly question. - Well, you must've at least thought about it. No, I'm too busy worrying about whether you're gonna come through for us or not. Okay, fine. Just pretend for a minute that I'm actually gonna do my job. Who am I working for? Am I working for the White House? Am I working for the State Department? - Am I working for Don Gaines? - Make Cal your client. Unless, I don't know, maybe you blame him for what happened here. Is that what it says in my file? Listen. We all fucked up here. Every one of us. (RETRO DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) (LAUGHTER, INDISTINCT CHATTER) (EXHALES) Shoot, double up. (DANCE MUSIC FADES) (SLOW, SOMBER MUSIC PLAYS) (INAUDIBLE) (SLOW, SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) CAL: There'll be transport in Paris. I gotta tell you, Mace, Alice has been, um, pretty adamant about going to the service. Yeah, I'll call you when I get there. If not now, then maybe we'll do something later stateside. You can tell her that. I keep thinking that I can take this. - You're gonna be fine. - Bullshit. Sooner or later, you're gonna realize that none of this was your fault. Every time you say that, it guts me. Then I'll stop saying it. - Take care of yourself, Cal. - Hey, Mace. Mason. Mason! TEPPLER: Mason. Mr. Skiles. Mr. Skiles. Mr. Skiles, good morning to you, sir. TEPPLER: Bloody traffic. Look, we're already late. She's waiting. Look, uh, it's the blue... It's the blue Renault across the street there. Can you see it? Right there. Off you pop. All right. Mr. Skiles? Quick as you can. - (KIDS SPEAKING ARABIC) - (MASON SPEAKING ARABIC) - Are you fucking kidding? - What? I'm talking about the card game. I was told to act naturally. - Well, Bashir, your new friend? - The host? He's the PLO Minister of Commerce. Yeah, I didn't get a real revolutionary vibe off him. Oh, well, he's a long way from the homeland. He's got a house in Spain and a condo in Sidon, and a Belgian hooker named Sandrine he keeps in a luxury apartment in Rue Hamra. MASON: How the hell does that work? Airlines. He's pulling over a million dollars a month 'cause he's the guy who guarantees the PLO won't blow your plane out of the sky. Mind telling me where you're taking me? The kidnappers called at 6:00 a.m. They know you're here. They wanna meet. - (CAR HORN BLARING) - (TIRES SCREECHING) We sent a comm signal out about 20 minutes ago and we just got called back. We've got four million in cash in the embassy safe. There's a Naval cruiser stationed offshore with a SEAL team on standby and ready to go. We've got approval to, uh, re-target the observation satellites. We've got all the pieces in place. We just gotta hope there's somebody worth talking to. Let's go. You all right? You look a little jet-lagged. I'm fine. GAINES: All right, let's go. (MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER IN ARABIC) (GREETS IN ARABIC) (JET ZOOMING OVERHEAD) (EXPLOSIONS) GAINES: That's the Syrian Air Force. Though I don't know what the fuck they're doing here. Shit's getting closer, though. (ARGUING IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) We send in four of ours. We hold four of theirs. We finish, we go back the way we came. All right. We're playing by ear from here on out, Mason. You follow our lead, we'll be fine. Gaines does the talking. Understand? - Just another pretty face. - All right, let's go. GAINES: Hey, buddy. (CHICKENS CLUCKING) (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) He says he's been waiting. - (EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE) - (RUMBLING) (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) He's asking, "Who's Skiles?" Tell him this isn't much to go on. (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) I'm Skiles. (IN ARABIC) (CONTINUES TRANSLATING) (EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE) "So where do you think we are?" (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) "Oh, yes, Saiyid. Mmm, the market is now open for business! "Come in! Come in!" (GAINES BREATHING HEAVILY) - (INDISTINCT MURMURING IN ARABIC) MAN: (DISTANTLY IN ENGLISH) Everything okay in there? (INDISTINCT ARABIC CHATTER) - (MAN OUTSIDE CONTINUES YELLING) GAINES: (IN ENGLISH) It's okay. Everyone stay where they're at. (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) Okay. Gonna standby. Okay. (BREATHING HEAVILY) MAN: I apologize. My friend was old. He was confused by anger. I know when we speak to America, we need clarity. We need to choose words carefully. (EXHALES) You agree, Mr. Skiles? Have I changed so much? What the hell is this? You know this guy? Yes, I do. Karim. Karim Abu Rajal. You look older. So do you. - (EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE) - (GLASS RATTLING) I apologize for the circumstances. I'm afraid we don't have a lot of time here. - MASON: You're apologizing an awful lot. - GAINES: Jesus Christ. Karim, what do you want? RUZAK: The fuck, Don? You're gonna let him... - Gary, shut the fuck up! - My brother... Rafid Abu Rajal. He's known to you. Yes. I will trade Mr. Cal Riley for the return of my brother. What makes you think we have your brother? Not you. Israel. (STAMMERS) Why come to us? - Why go to the son when the father is so close? - (EXPLOSION) You're saying the Israelis have Abu Rajal in custody and they're keeping it quiet? I think we would know something about that. He was with friends at the border in the south. And now he's missing. You understand my offer? Yes. Straight up. Cal for your brother. I have explained my terms. (INDISTINCT CHATTER IN ARABIC) - (IN ENGLISH) Wait. - Describe Cal's condition. - Alive. - GAINES: How do we contact you? - I trade only with Mr. Skiles. - RUZAK: Why? Because he doesn't trust you, either. - Insha'Allah. - Hold on a minute. What if they're not lying? If they can't find your brother, you're gonna have to come up with an alternative. Alternative? This is alternative. CROWDER: A, they killed him and haven't told us yet... GAINES: For Christ's sake, Sandy, it's Israel. Or B, they killed him and don't know it. Or C, they have him and don't know it. He's been picked up, but hasn't been ID'd yet. RUZAK: The guy they've been hunting the last 10 years? I don't think so, Sandy. CROWDER: Or D, he's hiding. He's been driven so deep, his own people don't know where he is. E, F, G, they have him in Tel Aviv in a cage with a socket in his ear! Does it even matter? You think if they have him, they're just gonna let him out so he can blow up another bus full of Israelis? So get out your checkbook. It's Abu Rajal! Are you kidding me? He's... He's Munich! There's always a number. Never happen. It's worth a meeting. And say what? Tell them about Cal? We do that, he's blown. We don't say anything. We go in, we drop a bomb, we see what happens. - Come on, get me a meeting in Israel. - Wait, wait, wait a minute. Hold on. You know I can do things you can't. I don't have to be here when this all blows up. I can play hard. RUZAK: These are our friends you're talking about. - You're over your fucking head. - Okay. Okay. You're over your head. So what's Cal's value on the open market, huh? You think that's some big secret? You think Karim is the only one that knows he hit the jackpot here? How long do you think he holds that gang together, huh? How long before one of those guys gets ambitious or pissed off or does something sloppy or stupid? I'm sorry. Right now, your only problem is getting the Abu Rajal brothers back together. And whether Rafid blows up another bus is something you'll need to worry about later, after Cal is safe. You don't have time to be polite and you cannot afford to be predictable. You need cards to play, and you need cards to play right now. So unless someone else has a better idea, I say we go rattle the Israelis before they can stonewall us. MAN: I'm sorry, but this is a waste of time. Rafid Abu Rajal? Seriously? - What's going on here, Gary? - I don't... Well, if you don't have him it doesn't really matter, now does it? I think it's safe to say that if we knew where he was, he'd be dead. And we're saying that he might be worth more to us alive. Why? MASON: We're not here to say why. We're just here to see if the market's open. Is this about you looking for the man who killed your wife? Would that get the ball rolling? MAN: There is no ball. You came all the way down here just for this? - No. - Okay, hey, hold on. Hypothetically. Just for fun. Let's say you did have him. What would it take? What's on your wish list? Sky's the limit. I'm sorry, Gary. Someday you're gonna have to tell me what this was all about. RUZAK: I must be out of my mind for bringing you down here. MASON: Relax. I can't even think of all the ways this is fucked. They're coming back to us. These are people I have to deal with every day, Mason. We're not done yet here, Gary. Are you drunk or delusional? We're in play. You need to be ready. - Back to the airport. - DRIVER: Yes, sir. Right now, the curiosity's driving your buddy crazy. (SCOFFS) You are. You're delusional. Okay, put up or shut up. I say they call before we take off. If I'm wrong, I'm off your back. I'm right, at the next meeting, the one they throw me out of, you're gonna stick around and close the deal. I'm begging you to shut the fuck up. - GUARD: Mr. Ruzak? - Yeah. There's a call for you. MAN: Munich Olympics. Madrid. Sixteen Israeli tourists. A synagogue in Istanbul. Fourteen victims. Children. El Al Flight 305. Forty-six dead. Families. All of this, Rafid Abu Rajal. So how much? We know what we're asking. What we don't know is the price. If we had him, we would never let him go. Okay, well, that's a tough opening. Is this man deaf? I think we're off the track here. Come on. It's a simple question. How much? We never said we had him. Then what the hell are we doing here? No! What the hell are you doing here? - (SCOFFS) - Wait for me. Wait for me. (CHAIR SCRAPES) (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) - Hypothetically. - They have him? Eh, they won't say. They're gonna take another look. He might be "lost" in the system. (WHISPERS) I think they have him. (SING-SONG) I think they have him. What do they want? You mean, other than to make sure you're not involved? (CHUCKLES) Syria has anti-aircraft bunkers all over the Beqaa Valley. Half of 'em are decoys. They want better satellite imaging. That's it? Two dozen Syrian targets they don't have eyes on? Take my word for it, it's a major piece of strategic intelligence. Did you tell them it was Cal? Or did they already know? Did you really think they were gonna make a blind deal back there? Of course I told them. This isn't the New England Chamber of Commerce, okay? You've got us in there playing good cop/bad cop with the world heavyweight champions. Look, we got lucky, okay? But that's the end of the flimflam. From here on out, you're our spokesman to Karim, that's it. End of story. (SCOFFS) This is bullshit up and down! Syrian bunkers, my ass! Those are Russian-built installations you're talking about. GAINES: Frank, we're running out of time. WHALEN: Are you fucking kidding me, Gary? RUZAK: They want pictures. They just want... MASON: Here you go. Thank you. (MUFFLED ARGUING) (MUFFLED) This is bullshit up and down! Syrian bunkers, my ass! Don't say a word. WHALEN: You're talking aboutjeopardizing U.S./Soviet relations here. GAINES: That's why Washington's gonna be making the decisions. RUZAK: We spoke with the Minister, Frank, and he was very direct. They give us Abu Rajal, we give them satellite pictures of the Beqaa Valley. WHALEN: But those pictures are the only thing keeping the Israelis from crossing over the border right now. RUZAK: A little dramatic. You take away those rockets, and the Israeli Air Force does whatever the fuck they want to up here. You give them that kind of intel, we might as well start handing the PLO their life preservers tonight. You think Riley's worth that? GAINES: Come on, guys. Are you serious? WHALEN: You like this, don't you, Gary? Two birds, one stone. You've been trying to push an Israeli invasion along for months. You know what? You might wanna check with your boss, Frank. I'm not the fucking Christmas help around here. I'll be calling the Secretary. Do what you have to do. - WHALEN: Count on it. - (MACHINE CLICKS OFF) See what you've been missing around here? (CHUCKLES) RUZAK: We're putting a plan in place. GAINES: Well, we're in play. That's the good news. Let's see what comes back. Did you get a chance to tell him? Alice is in town. She flew in from Athens this morning. She's obviously upset. She's gone back to their old apartment, which is no longer a safe neighborhood. I think she wants to talk to you. We need to get her out of there. He's on his way. (KNOCKS) Ma'am, Skiles is here. Alice. If that's for me, I'm... No. It's warm anyway. They've had the electricity off all day. Don Gaines told me you were an alcoholic. I guess that makes sense. God knows what he says about me. I know it's a lot to take in right now. I know they want me out of here. You've got the girls to think about. You say that as if you know them. The girls are fine. They're living with my parents... In blissful ignorance of all things adult. You think Cal's still alive? I do. People seem very motivated. How they seem? In Beirut? (SCOFFS) Most of the people you're talking to would love to see him disappear. People like who? Cal thought he'd earned the right to have an opinion. You'd think someone with so many secrets would be able to keep their mouth shut. - About what? - Seriously? Israel will fail here. They'll drown, like everyone who came before them. (WHISPERS) Just don't dare say it out loud. - Is that what he's done? - Oh, for Christ's sake. Look, Alice, I'm doing everything I can. - To do what? - To save him. Well, you've proven you can crush him. Bringing him back to life may be a little harder. Oh, God, this place. Staying here, all the things we might've done. We could've gone anywhere. You know, I think really in the end, he's just been here waiting for you to come back and tell him it's okay to leave. And here you are. (SOFTLY) It's too late. You can tell them I'm leaving tonight. Oh, and you owe me a favor. When you left Beirut, I packed your house. Dishes, papers... Nadia's clothes, all of it. Cal doesn't make it out of here, you pack this place up for me. I think that's fair. (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) She's ready to go. He's on his way down. CROWDER: Copy. BOY: Monsieur Skiles? (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) He's on his way? MAN: Yeah. He's coming to you. (BOY SPEAKING ARABIC) CROWDER: Mason! Mason! (DOOR CLOSING IN DISTANCE) (DOOR SLAMMING IN DISTANCE) (IN FRENCH) (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) Get her out of there right now. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) Fuck! (IN ARABIC) (MEN SHOUTING IN ARABIC) (PANTING) (IN ENGLISH) You went to Israel. Yes, Karim. They said maybe. Maybe they have him. So now we're waiting. Maybe? You wait for them? Bullshit! You wait for nothing! We are trying. They know it's important. Shut up! You have to tell them to make it work! Karim, I got back two hours ago! We are trying! (IN ARABIC) - (IN ENGLISH) I need to see Cal. - Impossible. I need to see Cal and I need to speak to him. Find Rafid. That come first. If I had your brother I'd let you talk to him. I said it's impossible! It's only impossible if he's dead! (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) What, are you fucking kidding me? I'm supposed to trust you now? (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) You're the whole reason I'm here! I gave my life up to protect you! (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) I want you to listen to me very closely if you ever want to see your brother again. I don't make a move until I talk to Cal. (SHOUTING IN ARABIC) (THUNDER CRACKING) (PLANE ENGINES WINDING DOWN) We don't have him. What? - We looked. - No. We don't have him. The wheels are in motion, Roni. Oh, we should worry? You wait three days to tell us Cal Riley is a hostage? What if he talks? We might have people in danger now. Without Abu Rajal? This doesn't give me many options, Roni. Work with what you have. And what do I have? Say it. Go ahead, you've had the whole ride up to think about it. You know what I want, Gary. Say it. Make this the moment. Make Riley the breaking point. US Embassy staff grabbed off the streets, kidnapped, killed. Clearly, the monsters have taken over Lebanon and something needs to be done. Give us the green light. We could clear this place out in a month. What, just burn Cal? And give Israel the keys to the city? We should worry for him? He's been a thorn in our side for years. Cal's network? His assets? You think the Agency's just gonna throw all that away? If he's not back soon, they won't have a choice, won't they? Oh, God. You've got lemons, Gary. Make some lemonade. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) You have any idea how many people we have out there looking for you? Obviously not enough. This kid, the messenger, he says what? "Follow me"? He gave me a note. A piece of paper. It had one word on it. "Karim." I didn't have a lot of time to make a decision. No one shows up? No, the kid bails on me. I fall down, I walk back here. I didn't see anybody out there looking for me. (IN FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) Take off your belt. What? Under the table. I'm giving you a new belt. What, a transmitter? I can't lose you again. Now do us both a favor. You're speaking at the university tomorrow, so make that your nightcap. And get something to eat. Merci. RUZAK: We're five days and counting, Gaines. (SIGHS) How much longer can you wait before you start pulling Cal's people? GAINES: I don't know. RUZAK: You don't know? What if this was all bullshit and they've been working Cal over from the start? - That's Mossad talking. - Fuck that, it's common sense. But I hate to say it, Gaines, if Cal talks, you want to be waiting for bodies to pile up on the embassy sidewalk? Tel Aviv loves this, don't they? We're gonna lose every asset we've got and they'll be the only game left in town. It's a tough decision, Don, but I need to know you're thinking about it clearly. Just give me 12 more hours. - Maybe we'll get lucky. - (SCOFFS) What the hell are we gonna do with Skiles? RUZAK: Do with him? He's a drunk. He's got the belt now, so keep an eye on him. He fucks anything up, well, it's always good to have someone to blame. Thank you. Yes, and next question? You, you with the striped shirt and the glasses. Do speak up. Yes, don't be shy. Mr. Skiles, you worked on the Paris Peace Talks when you were very young. Was that your first negotiation? Uh... My first? No. No, not by a long shot. Um, I was raised as an only child in a very small home with two people who basically hated each other just enough to stay together. (CROWD LAUGHING) So I guess you could say I've been mediating since well before I was born. So, to give you some kind of context, when I was about nine years old, (ON RADIO) one night my father came home from one of his girlfriends' house and, uh, my mother served him for dinner that night about a dozen of his best racing pigeons. So, uh, it would be about 10 more years before I heard the term "mutually assured destruction," but, uh, rest assured, I was very familiar with it growing up in that house. (LOUD RADIO FEEDBACK) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Go, go! (SPEAKING FRENCH) MAN: (IN ENGLISH) Go, channel six! - Get me my beacon! - Working on it. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) MAN: Let me help you, sir! Mr. Teppler! (SIREN WAILING) The Pharmacy Junblatt! Junblatt! What? Junblatt, near the Druze cemetery! Pharmacy Junblatt! You leave now, alone. - You understand? You need to go now. - Yes. Yes. I need Crowder on the line right now! Crowder's in a van outside. Pick it up, line two. Sandy? - What happened? Where's Skiles? - I have no idea. Unknown. Where the hell's my beacon? I can't get a fix. We're gonna have to move. (PEOPLE COUGHING) Hey, where is he? He's gone. He's gone. (IN FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) All right, we're on the move. Do not lose him! Shit! Skiles is MIA. Missing or taken? I don't know, but he's got the belt. - I want that signal relayed in here! - MAN: Yes, sir. I'm on it. Let's get a flag up for the Ops Team. You got it. Ethan, get me a line to the C of Ops Team. Sergeant Barry. It's not safe here, friend. (IN ARABIC) (IN ARABIC) (SIREN BLARING) MAN: Okay, 300 yards, straight ahead. Signal's good. Three hundred yards. Clear signal. Signal's locking in. Still moving southwest. 200 yards. (CROWDER SPEAKS FRENCH) MAN: (ON RADIO IN ENGLISH) Heading off to the left now. - Stabilizing. - Stabilizing. Signal still stabilizing. (BEEPING) MAN: It's stationary. (IN ARABIC) Get me a street address. Can we get an address right away? Gaines, come here. - We're sending them in, right? - Mmm-hmm. Tell Crowder to get out of there now before this gets loud. (SPEAKING ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) Don't move! Don't fucking move! Hands where I can see 'em! Keep your hands up! Don't fucking move! Not a move! Motherfucker. (SPEAKING ARABIC) (MASON BREATHING HEAVILY) (CLEARS THROAT) (IN ENGLISH) You have one minute. (FLIES BUZZING) (EXHALES SHARPLY) MASON: Hey, Cal. No, you're not hallucinating. It's me, it's Mason. Are you okay? You look okay. Okay. Listen, I'm here to help you, but we don't have a lot of time, okay? We gotta work quick. Mason, how did you get here? Listen. Stop, listen to me. All right? Now, Rafid Abu Rajal is missing. We're trying to make a trade for you. - The brother. - Yes. They asked me to come and make a deal. I want you to listen to me very carefully. Now, they sent me to Israel to try to find him. You know how wild it can get there, and you have to goose things along sometimes and chase things you don't want to chase. Israel? No. That's not who you should be... Karim has been very patient. Karim's been very patient. But your friends, your friends at the embassy... They like this idea. Yeah... I don't have as many friends as I used to. Okay, you can see everything is okay. Well, I think we all need friends. Cal, I know I could use a friend. I could use someone to trust. Right? I mean, don't you think that's true? How people can trust people based on whether or not they have something to gain? Right? What do you think about that, Cal? What do you think about those gains? Do you think those gains can be trusted? No. No, I wouldn't trust those gains. I'd feel a lot safer in a crowd. - In a crowd? - More of a crowd. Okay, it's enough. On a sandy beach. KARIM: Enough. - Sandy? - That's enough. - Have you talked to Alice? - Mmm-hmm. Get her to show you the picture of the girls. - In the photo album. In my apartment. - Time is over. - You need Abu Rajal? - That's all they want. - Tell Alice I pray she loves me only. - What? Tell her I pray she loves me only. - I pray she loves me only! - Stop! I pray she loves me only! What the fuck was that? You told me I could talk to him! You have seven hours. - How do I contact you? - No, talking is finished. You come to Fadya Crossing at 2:30 a.m. with my brother. Karim, that's not possible. Okay. So I sell Riley to the Iranians. Good luck with them. Fadya Crossing. 2:30. (MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC PLAYING) (GLASS THUDS) CROWDER: Stop. Put the bottle down. You think the gun is really necessary? I wish I knew. (IN FRENCH) MASON: (IN ENGLISH) You might want to wait a second on that. What the fuck are you doing here? I'm here looking for something that Cal told me was important. Turn the fuck around. When was this? About an hour ago. Yeah? Tell me something I can believe. Cal told me - I could trust you. Sorry. And that Gaines was not on our side. - Who the fuck are you working for? - My friend. Yeah? Cal or Karim? He told me to look for a photo album, that there was something important in it. Where is he? - He's okay. - Where? I don't know. We drove around. I was blindfolded. - Yeah, 'cause you took off the belt. - Yes. Are you kidding? You think I want Gary Ruzak dialing in a rocket strike on my last known location? There's nothing in that photo album. There's nothing here, Sandy. What the fuck is going on? Don Gaines has been skimming money from the station budget. There's a bank in Cyprus and all this shit. Cal found out and wrote a grievance. That's what you've been looking for. Cal wrote it up, but he was waiting, he wanted to hang in through the cease-fire before he blew the whistle. And I took it out of the photo album. I didn't want Alice to find it and light the fuse. Jesus Christ. Gaines is a thief and Cal knows about it? You don't find that problematic? Don doesn't know any of this. Are you willing to bet Cal's life on that? It wouldn't matter anyway. Cal's too valuable. No, Sandy. Now Cal is expendable. He's a threat to Gaines and a speed bump to Ruzak. They're just gonna burn him, and now they don't even have to wait that long to do it. What do you mean? Karim has given us six hours to deliver the brother. You're wrong. We've got a deadline. They'll get the White House involved. Israel can budge, they have to. Israel doesn't have Abu Rajal. They never did. They never said they did. It cost them nothing to toy with Ruzak. MAN: Sandy? (IN FRENCH) (IN ENGLISH) Listen, listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Cal called it, okay? He kept saying, "Pray, love, only." "Pray, love, only." I think he's right. I think the PLO have Abu Rajal. (MAN SPEAKS FRENCH) MASON: (IN ENGLISH) Come on, Sandy, think about it. You're the PLO. You're Arafat. You're desperately trying to hold this cease-fire together. The last thing you want is the Israelis coming across the border. One more incident, one more bomb, another assassination, and they're gonna stop asking for permission and they're gonna roll up and they're gonna push you right into the sea. Rafid Abu Rajal and his little splinter group? That's a problem. He's uncontrollable. So what do you do if you're Arafat? I think I would take him off the table. I would put Abu Rajal on ice, because Abu Rajal wants this to fuck up. He'd rather put a match to this whole thing. Ruzak wants the same thing as Abu Rajal. He said it, we heard him. "Two birds, one stone." He wants this thing to go sideways. He wants to tip it over and give Israel all the reason it needs to come on in here. Come on, Sandy, this is Cal talking. This is him telling us what's going on. If you let Gaines and Ruzak and the White House and Tel Aviv, if you let them run their game, Cal's gone. Waiting only increases the risk, you understand that, right? We had a chance today and we blew it. I need a master list of Cal's assets and code keys. We're gonna start prioritizing his people quickly so we can get the relocation budgets in place for the folks who qualify. You're hearing me, right? It's a death sentence. RUZAK: Jesus, Sandy. Nobody's quitting on Cal, okay? But we get paid to be ready, and right now, there's a hell of a lot of unprotected pieces in the field. You think I don't know how you feel? That could be any of us out there. (SIGHS HEAVILY) You're right. You're right. Maybe we get lucky. There's a secondary issue here with Skiles. I think we need to wrap him up as quickly as possible. It's covered. We picked him up half an hour ago. GAINES: Where? CROWDER: The bar at the Napoli Hotel. They're gonna bring him over as soon as they've sobered him up. GAINES: Son of a bitch. RUZAK: You know what? Don't. Don't sober him up. Keep him bombed. Get his signature on a security release and pour him onto a transpo later tonight. Okay. RUZAK: Hey, Sandy? You've done a hell of a job on this. I hope you know that. It hasn't gone unnoticed. (CHUCKLES) Thank you. Thank you, sir. (CAR HORN HONKING) Change your mind? - A little late for that. - What do you mean? Well, in an hour and a half the Embassy Duty Officer is gonna open the fifth floor safe and discover $4 million is missing. You were right. We're on our own. That's Raffik. (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) He's coming with us. Where is it we're going? - I thought we'd try and make a deal. - And do what? - Shake down the PLO? - Why not? I bet you're pretty handy with four million bucks. (CROWDER SPEAKING ARABIC) (SHOUTING IN ARABIC) (SHOUTING IN ARABIC) BASHIR: Sandrine?

Call it a finder's fee. $50,000 now, $50,000 on completion. That's a $100,000 phone call, Bashir. Plus another two million if you can deliver Abu Rajal to Almezzara Square, alive, and in the next hour. It's not so easy. Yeah, I know it's not so easy. We all know it's not so easy. That's why we're asking you so nicely. And if the old man says no? If the old man says no, then all this money goes home. MAN: Duty Officer says that she signed for the log. He thought it was for petty cash, but then it turned out that... All of it? The whole four million? - She knows Riley's code. - Oh, my God. She got radio equipment, a vehicle, weapons. (MIDDLE EASTERN MUSIC PLAYING) (CROWDER SPEAKING FRENCH) (IN ARABIC) CROWDER: (IN ENGLISH) Yes, I trust him. He's one of Cal's people. Cal doesn't come back, he's cooked. He's fighting for his life. Is that what you're doing? For Cal? You're making a hell of an effort. It's not some huge romance, if that's what you're thinking. It's not. We're here, and it gets lonely. Better me than someone else. Mmm-hmm. Okay. Come on, Bashir. He has to be here, like now. He's not gonna ditch us for 50 grand. If he tries to rip us off, it's gonna be for the whole package. (LAUGHS) What's it like to throw your whole career away in one night? You should know, right? You're tougher than I was. (CHUCKLES, INHALES SHARPLY) You know, I don't get surprised very often. Not in a good way. That's my version of a compliment. All right. Well, thank you. (RAFFIK SPEAKING ARABIC ON RADIO) (RAFFIK SPEAKING ON SPEAKER) MAN: (IN ENGLISH) He says they're coming southeast on Rue de Damas.

She's using just two walkies. But I may be able to track the UHF signal. Rue de Damas, where is it? MAN: Along here. MASON: There you go. $2 million. Two million is not enough. Look, I'm in a hurry and I'm already overpaying because you know that. - But I like my offer. - The answer to two million is no. CROWDER: Mason. It's him. It's Abu Rajal. May we speak privately? (SPEAKING ARABIC) MASON: (IN ENGLISH) All right, look. We told Bashir two million and you brought us Abu Rajal, so let's get this settled quickly. This is it. All I got. I'm topped out. The deal speaks for itself. You wouldn't open with your best offer if your life depended on it. - Two point two five. - Five million. - Three. - Four and a half is my floor. - Point blank. I have $3.9 million exactly. - Going once. Why should Bashir be the only person to profit off of this? - Going twice. - If you take the three-nine right now, I swear I will tell Bashir you settled for three-five. Then you can go back to Arafat with your head held high and $400,000 in your pocket. - Deal. - Al right. Let's go. We got him. Bring him. - Get the rest of the money. - This is all the money. I had a feeling we might be able to work this out. The thing that scares me about this is you haven't asked me once about what I'm gonna do with him. At these prices? I want you to look at my hand. See that? It's a laser sight. It's attached to a very high-powered rifle that my friend, Raffik, has up there. I've never seen anything like it. I thought you came in good faith. MASON: I did. And now I want to leave in one piece. You don't move until after we leave. Maybe you'll live long enough to spend some of that money. Let's go. - Where the hell are they? - Downstairs, sir. How much longer? Maybe he'll wait.

They're waiting for me. Anything might happen out there. Well, I'm not staying here. Another second with this murdering fuck and I'll lose my mind. (IN ARABIC) (IN FRENCH) WHALEN: What the hell is this? No, no, no, you're not putting this through. You can bet your ass I'm putting this through. Frank, this is not your area. This is an intel operation, Frank. It's a goddamned rodeo! CROWDER: (OVER RADIO) Mason, Mason, do you read me? MAN: They keyed back in. MASON: Yes, Sandy, I can hear you. It's him. It's Karim. - The goddamn location, come on! - Almost there. I'll keep the walkie keyed so you can hear what's going on. Copy. Cal goes first. He makes it across safe, then you get your brother. Why should I do that? Because you'll have me. I'll stay. You're not worth so much. Well, maybe you should've had someone more important make your deal for you. (SNICKERS) All right, all right. Okay, Sandy, we're moving forward. Cal's gonna come over. (ON SPEAKER) I'm gonna stay put. MAN: I'm getting a lock on this. GAINES: Gotta figure out the location. Thirty seconds. Just give me 30 seconds. Okay, get a team rolling now! You heard me, get a fucking team rolling! WHALEN: No, God damn it! This is Mason's deal. It's his hand, and you're gonna let him play it. You step in now, and I'll make sure you own this all the way to a Senate hearing. (MAN 1 SPEAKING ARABIC) (MAN 2 SPEAKING ARABIC) (EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE) (IN ENGLISH) I think about Nadia. Always good people suffer the most, yeah? Were we that wrong about you? What? Was I a terrorist? Not then. Not that night. But in the morning. (EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE) (KARIM SPEAKING ARABIC) (EXPLOSIONS IN DISTANCE) (MAN SPEAKING ARABIC) MASON: (IN ENGLISH) How you doing, buddy? You okay? Here's the deal. You're gonna go over alone. I'm gonna stay here until it's all done. That's your plan? It's kind of a work in progress. (SIGHS) Shit. All right, go. See you on the other side. Right. (KARIM SPEAKING ARABIC) (KARIM REPEATING COMMAND) (RADIO FEEDBACK) Okay, Sandy, he's coming over. Get the brother ready. Copy that. (CONVERSING IN FRENCH) CROWDER: (IN ENGLISH) Cal? CAL: Yeah. It's me. C al. (SPEAKING ARABIC) Rafid! Karim! (IN ENGLISH) Karim, are we good? (IN ARABIC) (SPEAKING ARABIC) Whoa, whoa, whoa. (IN FRENCH) (IN ARABIC) (IN ENGLISH) Karim, we're done here. It's all good, it's fine. MASON: Come on, Rafid. Put the... Go, Mason, go! (ALL SHOUTING IN ARABIC) (GUNSHOT) - (GUNSHOT) - Rafid! Rafid! (ALL SHOUTING IN ARABIC) (GUNFIRE) KARIM: Rafid... (GRUNTING) CAL: Mason! (SCREAMING) CAL: (IN ENGLISH) Mason, come on! (MUFFLED) Grab my hand! Grab it! I got you! (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (RONI SPEAKING ARABIC) (DISTANT CHATTER) MEDIC: (IN ENGLISH) Almost done here. All right, you're all set. Why don't you talk to Mason? Okay. You're good? I'll let you know once these meds wear off. How about you? Well, I'll let you know after I get a shower. (CHUCKLES) Think they'll ever find Karim? Well, if he doesn't find us first. I still cannot believe you pulled this through, man. I mean, I feel like I won the lottery. You saved my life and I got to see you again. Let's not take so long to do it next time, okay? I would like that. Thank you, Cal. That's the meds talking. WHALEN: Are you up for a quick debrief at the embassy? Am I gonna need a lawyer? Well, it's more of a luncheon. (CHUCKLES) Ruzak gonna be there? He's in the air, back to DC. He's got some powerful friends. Who's in charge of the station? Well, that job just opened up. Don Gaines resigned this morning. Not exactly sure why. But we did come in on budget. All I'm saying, Mason, is that there is a general satisfaction all around with the results here. Is that what you're saying? Things happened in haste, people acted in ways that might be subject to a variety of legitimate interpretation. Enough dancing, Frank. Everybody got what they wanted. It's a rare thing. Might as well enjoy it. - So, you riding with me? - I got him. MASON: Just forget all this ever happened, huh? Are you really gonna go for that? You should try it. If I were you, I'd kiss this place goodbye once and for all. What if you were you? I've got a pretty good bargaining position. They've already offered up some pleasant options. You got somebody making that deal for you? I've got a short list. I'm around till dinner, if you really want to stick it to 'em. (CAR DOOR OPENING, CLOSING) Well, the Israeli army has moved into southern Lebanon. It has a clear-cut single mission, namely pushing the PLO forces out of artillery range of Israeli settlements and towns. REPORTER #2: After enduring months of rocket attacks, Israeli soldiers, backed up by tanks, moved rapidly up the coastal road into West Beirut. REPORTER #3: The Israeli invasion of Lebanon has been deep and wide. It encompasses an area slightly smaller than Delaware, and about a third larger than Rhode Island. REPORTER #4: Evacuation of over 800 PLO fighters began today as more American troops arrived in Beirut to keep the peace. REPORTER #5: Pentagon officials say this terrorist attack on the Marine barracks caused the four-story structure to collapse, trapping and killing those Marines sleeping inside. REPORTER #6: In Beirut, Lebanon, today, a pickup truck loaded with explosives drove to the American embassy, and there was a tremendous explosion during the lunch hour. Peter Jennings... PRESIDENT REAGAN: This criminal attack on a diplomatic establishment will not deter us from our goals of peace in the region.
