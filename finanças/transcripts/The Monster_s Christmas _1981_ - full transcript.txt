("Silent Night") - Once upon a time, there was (girl speaking drown out by "Silent Night") (monster grunting softly) Now that was many years ago, the monsters were very happy, always laughing and singing. (monster grunting softly) Now there was nothing monsters like better than Christmas carols, and so every year on Christmas Eve they had a huge carol-singing competition. Then one Christmas, a wicked witch called Fistenduke entered the monsters' competition, but she sang so horribly that she came in last. Fistenduke was so, Fistenduke, what an awful name, Teddy, was so furious that she started a fight. And Fistenduke stole all the monsters' voices. And the monsters stole Fistenduke's magic wand and hid it. She hid the monsters' voices in her cave inside the mountain of rumbles, and told the monsters they could only get their voices back if they came to the cave and said the magic word. The monsters couldn't speak, so there was no way they could say the magic word. (monster grunts softly) Now, every Christmas the monsters search for someone who can say the magic words for them. And that's when-- ("Silent Night") Until they find that person, they'll never be able to sing their Christmas carols again. Poor monsters. (object clunks) Father Christmas. (light playful music) (monster grumbles) You're not Father Christmas. (monster grumbles) (stocking thuds) Hey, that's my Christmas stocking. I know what you are, you're a monster. (monster grumbles) And you don't scare me, 'cause you can't even talk. (monster sniffles) Oh no, of course. I'm sorry, I forgot. It's the carols, isn't it? The singing and everything. (monster moans) I know, that old Fistenduke took all your voices away, and now you can't tell anyone the magic words. (monster moans) Of course, someone else could say the words. (monster grumbles) But there's still Fistenduke, the old witch. (monster groans) If only monsters were magic too. What's that for? Um, poker? Uh, fire? A sword, a sword. No, no. I know, I know, a baton like a policeman. (bold synth music) (monster grumbles) The wand, the wand, you've got the witch's wand. If I had the magic wand, I could do anything. I could say the words for you, couldn't I? And Fistenduke couldn't do a thing about it. And everything would be good, and you'd get your voices back. (monster grumbles) Just one thing, you've got to get me back in time for Christmas. (monster grumbles) Come on, let's go and get the magic wand. (light whimsical music) ♪ I'm got to get their voices back, it's really up to me ♪ ♪ Without my help, the monsters will forever silent be ♪ ♪ So off to get the magic wand and get into the cave ♪ ♪ And meet the wicked witch ♪ ♪ And say the words I know we'll say ♪ ♪ The monsters from a silent night ♪ ♪ And from a silent day ♪ ♪ And with the help of the magic wand ♪ ♪ I'm sure we'll find a way ♪ ♪ And I must not be scared ♪ ♪ I must go without delay ♪ ♪ If I'm going to get their voices back ♪ ♪ And be home for Christmas day ♪ (sinister whimsical music) (gentle music) First, where've you hidden the witch's wand? (monster grumbles) (curious music) (gentle music) This is spooky. (eerie music) Oh, that's your place. (monster grumbles) (mysterious music) (wand whirring) (triumphant music) I'm tired. Let's have something to eat. How 'bout a chocolate? (monster grumbles) Don't monsters like chocolate? (monster grumbles) What do monsters like? (monster grumbles) (page crinkles) Hey, you ripped my book. (monster grumbles) Pictures? You eat pictures? (monster grumbles) Pictures of flowers? This was one of my Christmas presents. I could draw you some pictures of flowers I suppose. (monster grumbles) (light whimsical music) Yuk. Go away. (monster groans) (light whimsical music) (suspenseful music) (light whimsical music) (monster groans) You greedy leech. Forget about it, this one's a sunflower. (light whimsical music) (monster grumbles) (evil monster growls) (wand whirs) (monster grumbles) (wand whirs) (monster grumbles excitedly) (wand whirring) (fire crackles) (monster laughs) Come on, Mr. Monster, let's go to the witch's cave. (monster snorting) (objects clatter) (monster cries out) - Oh, it's you. Oh, get out of here, I'm trying to sleep. What? The wand? You found the wand? Well nevermind that. Where is it? (monster groaning) Where out there? (monster groans) A monster? Oh, I don't care how many monsters or what size they are, just go out there and find the wand. - It's an awfully long way. All the way through the forest, and then, up the mountain? (monster grumbles) Then the witch's cave. (monster grumbles) And all on my own. (monster grumbles) Are you sure you won't come? (monster grumbles) Nearly forgot. (paper crinkles) (monster grumbles) (lighthearted whimsical music) Bye, Mr. Monster. (lighthearted whimsical music) Anybody there? (tense bouncy music) (girl gasps) No! Put me down. Please, monster. Help! I'm on your side. Put me down. (gentle curious music) (monster chattering) I want to be a monster too, and I'm going to get all your voices back. (monster chattering) (gentle music) (evil monster grumbles) (gentle music) Well, how do I look? (monster chattering) Do you think Fistenduke will think I'm a monster? (monster chattering) (sighs) Oh, I wish you could talk. Stop it! That tickles. I'll tickle you. (monster chatters excitedly) Is that what monsters do when they're tickled? (monster chattering) (suspenseful music) (evil monster grumbles) (monster chattering) (tense music) (evil monster grumbles) (tense music) (monster chattering) (bouncy synth music) If only you could tell me what the magic words are. (monster chattering) (gentle music) (evil monster gasping) (gentle bouncy music) (girl gasps) (urgent bouncy music) (water rushing) (tense music) (evil monster grunting) (evil monster splashes) (slow synth music) (evil monster gasping) (gentle melodic music) (mud bubbling) (water bubbling) (gentle melodic music) (monsters chatter) (monsters exhale) (light whimsical music) (monsters grumbling) (gentle somber music) Oh, no. (monsters grumble) I need that wand. You are a mud monster, aren't you? (monsters grumble) If you don't give it to me, I'll never get your voices back. I've come such a long way. The first monster made me a monster too. See? (monsters grumble) All but my hands. And I do want to get out of here, so please. (monsters grumble) Thank you. Look. Now pay attention. How many legs do monsters have per head? 12? (monster chattering) 16? (monsters chattering) 15. (monster chattering) 15 legs and, four eyes as well? (monsters grumble) (paper crumples) (monster grumbling) (girl giggles) (monsters grumbling) (girl laughs) (paper crumpling) (girl laughing) (monster burps) (whimsical music) (tongue sputters) (whimsical music) (tongue sputters) (girl growls) (light whimsical music) (monster chuckles) Is my head ready? Yuck. (monsters groan) Oh no, I mean, yuck, good. (monsters grumble) (mud gurgles) - The magic word hello. A noisy greeting from below. (mud chattering incomprehensibly) - The magic word is like hello, a noisy greeting from below. (monsters groan) Hello, below. (monsters chuckle) Hello, below. Hello, baloo. Hello, baloo. Hullabaloo. Hullabaloo, hullabaloo, hullabaloo. (monster clap) Right, I know the magic word, but where are the voices hidden? - Above the horse and deep inside. Behind the teeth the voices hide. - Above the horse and deep inside. Behind the teeth, the voices hide. What does it mean? (monsters chattering) (mud gurgles) (monsters grumbling) Oh well, time to go I suppose. - [Both] Sh. (grunt) - Oh. (deep buzzing) (monsters gasp) (light whimsical music) (Fistenduke grunting) - 18, 19, 20, and now. (woman on TV drown out by Fistenduke groaning) And a one, and a two, and a three, and a four, and a five, and a six, and a seven, and an eight, and (drown out by Fistenduke groaning) nine, 10, and lift your hands very clearly above the head. And 19, 20, and hold. Well ladies, we should be nicely loosened up now and ready for something a little more strenuous on the bar. (gentle somber music) (monster hisses) (suspenseful music) (monster grumbling) (suspenseful music) No! (girl's voice echoing) (monsters yell) - [Woman On TV] And hold. Up and hold. And up. (Fistenduke groans) And up and over and round, and up and over and round. And up and over and round, and keep those legs straight. And up and over and-- - Oh, get out of here. Can't you see I'm trying to concentrate? (monster grumbles) Oh! Oh, you clever, Nasty. You found the wand. No more exercises. Oh, give it to me. Give it to me.

It's not there. (monster grumbles) Ah! Go on and get it! Go on! (whimsical music) Turned people into toads for less than this. (curious music) (eerie whirring) (anticipatory music) (monsters grumbling happily) (triumphant music) (curious music) - Hello. What have we here? A baby monster. Oh, bit angry are we, dear? (laughs) What are you doing here? Got lost, did you? Hm? Well, well, well, well, well, can't speak, can you? (laughs) Not since I took your voices away. (Fistenduke laughs) Oh, I hate monsters. So big and ugly. Not you. You're not so bad. Hm. Ugly, oh. But not so big. You know what I like best about monsters, hm? This. (laughs) Oh, I think that's so funny. That's what happens when you pull their ears. You know, there's something else monsters are good at. Work. You've stumbled in here at exactly the right time. Mm, must have things right for Christmas, eh? Dusting and sweeping and polishing. Oh, we'll have everything ready for us all to sing the carols. All except you, that is. Mm? Oh, come on now, none of that. Crying comes later. Now is the time for work. Come along. Come along. Oh, nice hands for a monster. (triumphant music) (monsters grumbling) Welcome to my little gymnasium. Uh, plenty to do here. Now first, you can polish the horizontal bar. Then I want the whole place dusted up. Hm. The mats turned and shaken, and I'll have the walls wiped right down, right down. Now the floor, I'd like this whole floor scrubbed and polished. And then you can start on this exercycle. Clean it right down with a damp cloth, and then oil all the moving parts, hm? Oh, now perhaps you'd like a little something to eat before you start. I don't want you fainting on me. Well, a little Christmas something, especially for a monster. (chuckles) Oh. This is such fun. I haven't done any drawing for a long time. If you get indigestion it's because I'm out of practice. (Fistenduke laughs) Oh, there are fish eyes. Oh. And uh, some thistle leaves. (eerie music) I think. (startling music) Oh, and a little bat's milk, of course. (Fistenduke vocalizing) Ah, here we are then. A special treat. (vocalizing) - Madam. (Fistenduke vocalizing) (tense music) (monster groans) (monsters chattering) (triumphant music) - Oh, show me. Mm, not bad. You can hoist them up again later. Uh, over there. - Hm? - Bicycle. - Mm. (Fistenduke hums "Deck the Halls") Wipe it clean. Have you done the trampoline? Oh? Well, the horse then, polish the horse. ♪ Don we now our gay ♪ The horse, the vaulting horse. By the dumbbell, stupid. Oh! ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ - Above the horse, deep inside. Above? (mysterious music) Behind the teeth, the voices hide. (eerie music) - What are you staring at? Mm? (curious music) (monster panting) (tense suspenseful music) (monsters yelling) (suspenseful music) (humming) Shine up those dumbbells. (Fistenduke vocalizing) (curious music) Well, have you found the orb? (monster grumbles) No. Huh? Monsters? Monsters are coming? (monster grunts) One, two, three monsters are coming? The mountain monster, hm, hm? Um, um, a fast, fast monster. (monster grunts) Uh mud, mud monster. They smell terrible. Huh? Oh yes, that's a monster. It's my new helper. Well, I need someone 'round here, you're always out wasting your time. Ah, don't keep opening and shutting your mouth like that. That monster, um, can, speak? Why didn't you tell me? (triumphant music) (monsters grumbling) I'll get you. Oh, you ugly, little leech. Ah! Nobody fools Fistenduke. Oh, just you wait. (yells) Excuse me. Ah! (triumphant music) (monsters grumbling) (curious music) (monster grunts) Ah! Sh. (curious music) Get. (lighthearted music) (suspenseful music) (triumphant music) (monsters grumbling) Ah! Huh? Oh! (tense synth music) (wand whirring) (Fistenduke laughs sinisterly) (scary music) Oh! (Fistenduke gasps) (curious music) (monster grumbling) (drums rolling) (Fistenduke gasps) (Fistenduke laughs) That's what happens to clever people. And now we'll see what happens to people who don't mind their own business. You came in here, into my cave, to take something. Didn't you? You came in here to take the monsters' voices. And that makes you a thief. (monster sighs) And you know what happens to thieves, don't you? Especially thieves who try to fool Fistenduke. Ha! (monsters grumbling) Ah! No! (wand whirring) (Fistenduke gasping) Oh! (suspenseful music) (monsters grumbling) (magical airy music) (monsters chattering) - Hullabaloo!
