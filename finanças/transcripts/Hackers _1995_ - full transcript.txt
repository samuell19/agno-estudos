Let's move! Upstairs. Go, go. What's going on? What's the matter? - Who are you? - Come on, come on, let's go. - Hey. - Cover the back. Dada! Dada! Knock it down. The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls himself "Zero Cool," has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature. This defendant possesses a superior intelligence, which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end. His computer virus crashed 1507 systems, including Wall Street trading systems, single-handedly causing a seven-point drop in the New York stock market. Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family $45,000. I sentence you to probation, under which you are forbidden to own or operate a computer or a touchtone telephone until the day of your 18th birthday. - Dade. - Yeah, Ma? What are you doing? I'm taking over a TV network. Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday. Security. Norm. Norman speaking. Norman, this is Mr. Eddie Vedder from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. And, listen, I'm in big trouble. You know anything about computers? Um, gee... Right, well, my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki. And if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit hara-kiri. Uh... Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques. Could you read me the number on the modem? Um... It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it. It lets my computer talk to the one there. 212-555-4240. So-called American Indians, Latinos, and blacks come from a genetically mediocre stock. - Yak, yak, yak. - Being a racist means being aware of racial divisions... - Get a job. - And I am. Say I'm a... You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to... - the Outer Limits. - Yes! Hey. What? Zero... No, wait. Is this the day? Is this the beginning of the end? There is no time to wonder, no time to ask, "Why is it happening? - Why is it finally happening?" - Unbelievable. - There is time only for... - A hacker. Do we pray? Or do we merely run now? Yeah, okay, "Acid Burn," that's enough. Shit on me. 'Morning. You unpack your stuff yet? Mm. Up all night again, huh? Can this wait till both of my eyes are open, please? Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week. Well, yes, he could be playing with himself. Mm-hmm. Yes, I'll ask. Dade? You like girls, don't you? Yeah. I just haven't found one as charming as you yet. You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? - Right, Dade? - Right, Mom. And I'm still a virgin. You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you? Dade, turn the shower off. You screw up again, and you won't get into college. I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year. I didn't want to sell the house, but I had to take this new job. You know that. You're going to love New York. It's the "city that never sleeps." I miss you, too, baby. Claro que si. Excuse me...? Yo, chill, man. I'm talking to Venezuela. Yeah, I'm sorry. I was just looking for the principal's office. Sorry, I can't help you, kid. You have your transfer forms? It's a relatively straightforward question. - Do you speak English? - Sorry. You wanted... I wanted transfer forms. Thank you. Are you coming? The gym is through there and the cafeteria is through there. Great. Cool. What's your name? Kate. Kate Libby. - Here's your class. - My class? You mean I'm... I'm not in your class? No, you're not in my class. Give me time. - Hey, you new? - Yeah. Tell him about the pool, Kate. Pool? Yeah, there's an Olympic-size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there. Yeah. Sure. Thanks. Hey, hold the door! No pool. Oh! Oh, my God. He found the pool. I'm Mr. Simpson. I'm subbing for Miss Bayliss, who was arrested at the anti-fur rally. I know some of you kids got computers at home, but these are school property, people. And I don't want to see any gum stuck to them. Chapter 1... "Designing Graphical Interface...' So what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual? Homicidal. What's up, man? I'm the "Phreak." The Phantom Phreak...? The King of NYNEX...? I know you play the game. Phreak, Phreak, Phreak. Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude. - Joey, Joey, Joey. - What? What? What? One more "dude" out of you, and I'm gonna slap the shit out of you, okay? Now I try to save you from yourself, but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man. - You're hopeless. - Du... - Check it... - I need a handle, man. I mean, I don't have an identity until I have a handle. You know, you're right about that. Check it. Friday. Look... all right, wait, wait. How about the "Master of Disaster," huh? You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless. "Ultra Laser." "Doctor Doom." Records, tapes, CDs... Bootlegged Chinese software here. - How much for the hard drive? - Three for 30. Just tell me what you need. What do you need? - Records? Tapes? - You got any Rush? Any kind of format, any kind of disk, any bootleg you need. Check this out, each and every one of you... Compilation tapes of my own making. I call this "The Greatest Zukes" album, featuring artists like... I got some Hendrix on there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... All great artists that asphyxiated on their own vomit. You can't get this in stores, man. One of a kind, $2. All major transactions... Please deposit $5 for the first minute. Thank you. No, no, no, thank you. That's a nice score for a girl. Think you can do better? I'll give it a shot. Is this kid bothering you, Kate? Sorry, can I get some room here? Yeah, why don't you come up here? He's good. Well, it looks like I'm on top. Congratulations. No one's ever beat her before. You just made an enemy for life. "Boy Meets World," let's go. - Who's that? - Curtis. - And what's he do? - That's it. You're looking at it. He just looks slick all day. Joey! What's up? Oh, my God. You? Oh, my God. Way cool! You saw that? What the hell is going on? The pool on the roof must have a leak. Man, oh, man, this is gonna be good. "God gave men brains larger than dogs' so they wouldn't hump women's legs at cocktail parties." Ruth Libby. I'm not so sure your mother qualifies as a significant author of the 20th century. Her last book sold two million copies. Ooh...! "Angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of the night." It's Ginsberg. Nice. Very nice. He's not in this class. I said give me time. He's not enrolled in this class. Well, he's on my list. "Of all the things I've lost, - I miss my mind the most"? - Whoo! - Ozzy Osbourne. - You, what is your name? Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir. You, however, are not on my list. Whoa. This isn't wood shop class? Out. Out. Class-crashing? Come on. Some people are too much. - Bye. - Thank you. Thank you, sir. - How was school? - Hm. What did we learn in school today? - Revenge. - Ah. Did we meet somebody special? No. No one special. Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late. Would you try and please fill these out? Don't worry, it's only the rest of your life. Right. Anything else? You want me to mow the lawn? Oops, I forgot. New York... no grass. And unpack. FYI, man, right? You can sit at home and do, like, absolutely nothing and... And your name goes through, like, 17 computers a day. "1984"? Yeah, right, man. That's a typo. Orwell is here now. He's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks. Meet "Cereal Killer," as in Fruit Loops. But he does know things. Anyway, anyway, guys, guys, listen, listen. I'm in this computer, right? So I'm looking around... - You got those Crayola books? - Oh, yeah, Technicolor rainbow. Here, a green one. What is that? What is that? What is that? Let me see. - What are these? - International UNIX environments. Luscious orange...? Computer security criteria, DOD standards. The "pink-shirt book"... Guide to IBM PCs, so-called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy wears on the cover. - What's that? - Devil book, the UNIX bible. - What's that? - Dragon book, compiler design. Oh! yeah? - What's that? - The red book. NSA-trusted networks, otherwise known as "The Ugly Red Book That Won't Fit on a Shelf." Anyway, anyway, GUYS, guys, guys, come on. I'm in this computer, right? So I'm looking around. I'm looking around, you know, throwing commands at it. I don't know where it is or what it does or anything. It's like... it's, like, choice. It's just beautiful, okay? Like, four hours I'm just messing around in there. Finally, I figure out that it's a bank. Right? Okay, wait. Okay, so it's a bank. So this morning, I look at the paper, some cash machine in, like, Bumsville, Idaho, spits out $700 into the middle of the street. - That's kind of cool. - That was me. - That was me. I did that. - You did this from your house? What, are you stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house. You'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains? In your ass? - Don't you know anything? - It's stupid, man. Universally stupid. You guys always think I should know everything. You never tell me anything, right? Right? All right, what are the three most common used passwords? "Love," "secret" and "sex." But not in that order necessarily. Right? Yeah, don't forget "God." System operators love to use "God." It's that whole male ego thing. Look, you want to be elite, you gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit. Yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons, man... You know, the supercomputers they use to, like, do physics and look for oil and stuff. Ain't no way, man. Security is too tight... the big iron. Maybe. But if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd work my way back through some low security - and try the back door. - Yeah, but, oh, man, wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Mm! Yo, who ate all of my fries? - Joey. - No, no, no, I didn't touch your fries. - I did not touch your fries. - Cereal, man, you owe me a pack. - It was him, man. - You suck, dude. You need to lay off that shit. What are you doing? I'm gonna hit you. Yes! Home run. Home run. Okay, okay, okay. You and me, Lucy. We're gonna show 'em, baby. Ow. Mr. Belford? My name is "the Plague." Mr. The Plague, something weird's happening on the Net. As in what, you hapless techno-weenie? The accounting subdirectory on the Gibson is working really hard. We've got one person online, but the workload is enough for, like, 10 users. I think we've got a hacker. Okay, okay, we need proof that we were here. All right. Yeah. Garbage. Okay, give me Garbage. Shit. Never fear, I is here. I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23. Let's echo 23, see what's up. God wouldn't be up this late. Shit. Get me the switching control center. I need to trace a call that's in progress. Oh, shit. Yeah, hold on. Hold on, Mom. Hold on one second. Open the door, Joseph. Yeah. Yeah, okay. There you go. Bed. Sleep. Now. Sweet dreams, Joseph. - He's gone. - Did you get a trace? - Yeah, we got him. - Good. Okay. Nice place, huh? You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? - You know who he is? - No. Don't know who he is. Do you? Nikon. Lord Nikon, this is... Crash Override. Never heard of you. Done anything? No. Come on! I hate this neighborhood. What? Your mom buy you a "'puter" for Christmas? - Does he know anything? - Sure, man. He's elite. Come in. Uh, Nikon, can... can I crash at your place tonight? Again? Yeah, sure. Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate private and publicly-owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses - and stealing materials... - Who are these guys? Agent Richard Gill. You're hacker enemy number one, man. - You're a boner. - Thank you, Mr. Gill. Yo, showtime. Showtime. Hey! - What's going on? - Four... three, two, one... Welcome to our show. - "Hack the Planet." - "Hack the Planet"! And for those late-night hacks, Jolt Cola, the soft drink of the elite hacker. - Who are these guys? - That's Razor and Blade. Razor and Blade. That's right. This is a pay phone. Don't ask. As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder. Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters. Record the tones that the coins make, then hang up and get your money back. And never again pay for a service that would be dirt-cheap... If it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons. Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait. Baby, I'm a real wild child. I'm a wild one. I'm a wild one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Joey! Joey! Thank you. Thank you. - Freeze! - What? What did I do? - Get out of there! Come on, get out. - What? - Joey?! Joey! - Get in there. Get in. - What? What? - Sit down. - Stay down there. Don't move. - Lucy...! - Joey! - Where are you taking...? Give me my...? Joey! - How is it going, Ray? - Looks good, sir. We got an uncorrupted hard drive. In English, please. I didn't spend 10 years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot. I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had enough time to erase his computer files. Good. Good man. All right, let's finish up here, - take him in for interrogation. - All right, sir. Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your time? Why, of course, Jennifer. - Joey. - Mom. Just how dangerous are hackers? Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate private and publicly-owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses and stealing sensitive materials for their own ends. These people... They're terrorists. - Joey. - Thank you, Mr. Gill. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene. Once again, don't call me Eugene. Our recent unknown intruder penetrated using a super user account, giving him access to our whole system. Precisely what you're paid to prevent. Someone didn't bother reading my carefully-prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now then, as I so meticulously pointed out, the four most-used passwords are "love," "sex," "secret" and "God." So would "Your Holiness" care to change her password? A hacker planted the virus. Virus? Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty and flooded its tanks. Excuse me? The little boat flipped over. A virus planted within the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility. What, it left a note? Unless $5 million are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet. - Is that...? - That is the virus... "Leonardo da Vinci." The problem is, we have 26 ships at sea and we don't know which ones are infected. Well then, put the ships' ballast under manual control. There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These ships are totally computerized. They rely on satellite navigation, which links them to our network... And the virus... Wherever they are in the world. So what are we supposed to do? Well, luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The Secret Service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it. Look, now we expect you to get onto this right away, yeah? - Yeah. - Well, how soon? Well, we're working on it as fast as we can. This is a very common occurrence in corporations as large as ours. - You have nothing to worry about. - Yeah, right. - You sure about that, Mr. The Plague? - Yeah, the Secret Service - is helping us out, 100%. Okay? - Yeah, okay. - We'll be in touch. - Talk to you later. What the hell was that all about? I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file. What? I created Mr. da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service, so they'd arrest the hacker, seize his equipment... Things that we can't do on our own. I don't want to go to jail for this. Relax. Think about the $25 million. But you've created a virus that's gonna cause a worldwide ecological disaster just to arrest some hacker kid? Basically, yeah, mm-hmm. - Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. - Shh, shh. - I'll take care of this. - All right, sir. I can cancel it any time. I don't need any program code. But it's the perfect cover to confiscate the disk and find out how much of that garbage file has been copied. Get it! Why did I ever trust you? Get the file. Otherwise you'll lose all your toys. Did you find the program for the virus on any of the disks we confiscated? No. He's either very smart or very stupid. Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment. Keep tight surveillance and see if he leads us to your disk. Unit 3, outside suspect Joey Pardella's apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still grounded... by his mother. Listen to this bullshit. "This is our world now... The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. Lam a hacker and this is my manifesto." Eh? Right? Manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all." Now that's cool. Cool? - Yeah, cool. - You think it's cool? It's cool. It's not cool. It's commie bullshit. - Yo, back off. - Relax. Back off! So what do you think? Can I crash at your place tonight? What is it with this guy? His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust? Yeah, probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho. You think he could hack a Gibson? - Did you talk to him? - No. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. He isn't to consort with his computer friends. The Secret Service is really out to get him. Hey, there's a big party tonight. You want to go? It's at Kate's. Thought so. Oh, yeah. A little pelvis and booty. A little pelvis and booty. Come on. Come on. Let's go. That's right. Come on. You want to fight? Huh? Huh? What the hell are you doing? - Hague? - Huh? Plague! - Gill. - I think we got something. Ugh. Hard copy. Dade Murphy. - Secret Service! - Don't move! - Christ, what are you? - Shut up! - What are you doing? Get off me. - Shut up. Shut your mouth. Agh-hh! Just sit on the bed and keep your hands where we can see them. The year was 1988, and this nasty virus crashed 1500 systems in one day. - 1507. - Wow. It got you seven years' probation, no computer, couldn't even use a touchtone phone. Must have been hell, huh, "Zero Cool"? A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it. However, we've come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He, or perhaps his accomplice, has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. - We want you to help us find it. - Gill? Loser. I can't believe you were only 11 when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade... I know how you might feel about narc-ing on your friends, but we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you. I'm... I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm the one who understands you. Now can we be allies? Nah. I don't play well with others. Shit! Come on! Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school. No colleges would take you... no future, exiled from everyone and everything you love. I'll be in touch. It's fine. Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay? Blow me. Thank you. Her mom makes big bucks writing self-help books for women, stuff like, "Women Who Love Men Who Are Emotional Amoebae." That explains a lot. Something ain't right... - Hi. - Hi. I'm gonna get myself, I'm gonna get myself. I'm gonna get myself connected... Hit it, baby. Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Look at that. Boom! Big man, stepping in, stepping in coming through. Ooh! Big man, big boots. You look good, girl. I'll catch you later. Yo, what's up, Nikon? Phreak in the house, man. Thanks, man. Dade, man, you made it. Yo, yo, Houston, we have lift-off. Three o'clock... check it. Don't look right away. What's wrong with you? Look at her, man. Look at that. Oh. Ooh! Let's see. Lisa Blair. 26 East 7th Street, apartment 16. - 555-4817. Boom! - Boo-yah! - How did you know that? - I got a photographic memory. It's a curse. Lisa! Stumble you might fall... Hey, how do you know my name? Ooh, look at that pooper, man. Spandex... it's a privilege, not a right. Ain't gonna go blind... Hi. My name is Vicki and I'm an addict. Hi. My name's Hank and I'm an addict. Uh, my name's Joey, but, uh, I'm not an addict. No, no, really, really, really. Listen. Listen. Look. I got in trouble with my computer, right? Okay? My lawyer told the judge that I'm an addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer. No, really, really, I'm not an addict. I'm not. I'm not. Can I get some more coffee? Thank you. Yo, check this out, guys. This is insanely great. It's got a 28.8 BPS modem. - Yeah? Display? - Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, the baby is sweet. Ooh. - I want it. - I want it to have my children, man. Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark. Yo, hit the light. - Ooh. - Oh, wow. - Shit. - Shh. Come on. Yeah. - Was that her top? - One-handed. Difficulty rating? Seven. - Baby. - Wow. Burn's "wetware" matches her software. - "Burn"? - Shh. - What the...? - What are you guys doing in here? I'm sorry. We're sorry. Just checking out your fly laptop. It's hyped, you know. You're in the butter zone now, baby. Huh...? Yeah, it is. I want to triple the RAM, all right? Ooh, "leopard boy." And the Decepticons. Kate, Kate, you're not going into that computer shit now, right? One sec. Yeah. Later. - Yeah, right. - The sensitive type. What is he doing in here? Relax, Burn. He's my guest. Burn? You're "Acid Burn"? - You booted me out of OTV? - What? I'm Crash Override. You're the moron that's been invading my turf? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. "C rash" and "Burn." Murphy kid turn you down? I disguised myself as an Alabama state trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC. Pervert. What are you talking about? The FBI computer holds files on 20 million Americans. I just hacked into it. Congratulations. From here, I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year. Custody battle. The boy chose to go with his mother. SQ? So we get the mother... we get the boy. This girl I know. Needs some shelter. She don't believe anyone can help her. She's doing so much harm. Doing so much damage. But you don't want to get involved... What the hell are you doing? It's cool. I'm just looking. - It's too much machine for you. - Yeah? I hope you don't screw like you type. It has a killer refresh rate. P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium. Yeah, it's not just the chip. It has a PCI bus. But you knew that. Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything. Yeah. RISC is good. You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste? Crash Override. What was it? "Mess with the best, die like the rest"? Yeah. - Are you challenging me? - Name your stakes. If I win, you become my slave. - Your slave? - You wish. You'll do shit work... Scan, crack copyrights... - Whatever I want. - Deal. - And if I win? - Humph. Make it my first born. - Make it our first date. - You're not gonna win. And you have to smile. I don't do "dates." But I don't lose either. So you're on. So here's the deal. The chosen contest... To hassle Secret Service Agent Richard Gill and get one back for Joey. Our decisions are final by a vote of two to one. No appeals. The duel will last until we declare a winner. Use only the dial-up access codes and passwords in your collection. Can't ask for any help from us. You talkin' to me? - Any questions? - Yeah. Who's going to notify his next of kin? What the...? All right, he's in the personal ads. "Disappointed white male, cross-dresser, looking for discreet friend to bring dreams to reality. Leather, lace and water sports. Transvestites welcome." I know where you can stick it. I... I know where you can stick it. - Hello? - I want to lick your earlobes. I want to lick your lips. I want to lick your toes. Oh, yeah, you want to lick? You want to lick something? Lick this. - That's why they call me "Stallion." - Oh, that's disgusting. - My heart is steaming for you. - Oh. - I hope to spank you with my... - I'll spank your ass. - Turn you over and make you beg... - Oh! - Ugh. - Animal. Hey! Ow. Hey, hey, hey, do you know who I am? Do you know who I am? Ow! This is Accounting, sir. You inquired about an employee of ours, Agent Richard Gill? Yes. - Our records indicate he's deceased. - I'm what?! - Dead. - Dead? Yeah, like rigor mortis, habeas corpus. - Very impressive. - Superhero-like even. Yeah, whatever. What's the score? - Tied. - Oh, come on. What? What? Come on. Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and all, guess you two will have to improvise the next round. Right. I win... you wear a dress on our date. And if I win... so do you. Deal. Yes! Yeah, baby... Yeah, baby... Yeah, baby... Oh...! Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed. You are man enough to stick with the deal, aren't you? Thanks. You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well, let me explain the new world order. Governments and corporations need people like you... and me. We are samurai, the keyboard cowboys. And all those other people out there, who have no idea what's going on, are the cattle. Moo. I need your help. You need my help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Aw, think about it. Enjoy the laptop, Cool. Tell me where the disk is. You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not grounded anymore. - Yo, what's up? - Dude, dude, dude, I gotta talk to you, man. Listen, listen, listen. - I copied a garbage file. - Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey. No, no, it's, like, hot or something. I don't know. Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data, junk. It's the stuff that's been erased, man. I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, all right? Will you take a look for me? Okay. Oh, shit, Joey. You got a tail. Shit! Lam watching you. Ramon, wake up. Hm...? Ramon? Wake up. Vámonos. Time for school. Come on. Don't move! - Don't move! - Déjà vu. Ray Sanchez, you're under arrest under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986. ¡La computadora de mierda! What are you waiting for? Arrest me already. You get one call. Uno. Understand? Hello. Operator Services. Hello, Operator, I'm having trouble dialing a number. - What number, please? - 555-4202. - Just one moment. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hey, it's me. - Phreak? - I'm freaking. Joey wasn't making it up. He really hacked into Ellingson. He gave me the disk with the file he copied, and now I'm in jail. They're charging me with some serious shit and there's stuff I didn't even do, like, get this, inserting some virus called "da Vinci." And they keep asking about you guys. - You think they're gonna bust us? - Yeah. You'd better figure out what's on that disk, 'cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time...? Hi. And now I see what all the fuss is about. Hey, you have company. - It's a nice room. - We need your help. Do my ears deceive me? No, “O, “O, no, no, no, no. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, right? Awake-up call for the Nintendo generation. We demand free access to data. Well, it comes with some responsibility. "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child. I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things." What? It's Corinthians 1, Chapter 13, verse 11. You know, duh. Come on. Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disk. I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted. I can't afford to get arrested. I'm sorry. Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something. What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but we're supposed to be on the same side, and we really need your help. I really need your help. I'm sorry. I can't. Loch well, could you just make a copy of the disk and just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that? Listen, you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge. Cereal has. Thank you. - Okay. I'll copy it. - Okay, thank you. The girl... The girl has the disk I need. I told you, I don't play well with others. Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file. Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial. She will not pass "Go." She will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears. That's bullshit. What can I tell you? Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work. She'll be handcuffed and later strip-searched. You lay a finger on her, and I'll kill you. Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death, and I can do all of them. - Talk to me. - I got it. But, listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone. Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy is safe now, okay? - Kate, listen. - Hold on. - I have to tell you something. - Hold on a sec. - This is so lean and clean. - It's like a hacker wrote it. Come here. Look at this. Man, this thing is tense. Lookit. That's ill, man. It's incomplete. It's taking forever and a day to figure out. I'll make some coffee. Tag, you're in. It isn't a virus. It's a worm. What's this one eat? It nibbles. You see all of this? This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million-dollar deals to the 10 bucks that some guy pays for gas. The worm eats a few cents from each transaction. And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks. Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started? Right, and at this rate, it ends its run in... - Two days. - Judging by this segment alone, - it's already eaten about... - 21.8 million bucks, man. Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall, and that's Phreak and that's Joey and that's us. We gotta get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it. - I know. I know who wrote it. - What? This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disk you gave me. - What? - You what? I didn't know what was on it. Oh, man. That's universally stupid, man. Yo, man. You're an amateur, man. - Why did he come to you? - I've got a record. I was Zero Cool. Zero Cool... crashed 1507 systems in one day... The biggest crash in history, front page of "The New York Times," August 10, 1988. I thought you was black, man. Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! - Oh, shit! - That's far out. This is Zero Cool, man. Yeah, well, that's great. There goes MIT. - I'll make it up! - Yeah? How? I'll hack the Gibson. Dude, they'll trace you like that, man. The cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun. - Fucked if I care, man. - Even if you had the password, it'd take you 10 minutes to get in, and you still gotta find the files, man. I mean, the cops would have you in five minutes. Oh, wow. We are fried. Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven. You're both screwed. I help... we do it in six. Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help... we can do it in five minutes, man. Okay, let's go shopping- Whoo-hoo! Boom! You know... if I didn't live by a strict code of honor, I might take advantage of this situation... Erotically, as it were. All right, hold it right there! Shit! My subway defense system. He's way down there. Ta-da! Yo, brain-dead... The manual! Oops. Hey! Truck! Find it? Oh, the phone's all right. The problem must be somewhere else. They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know? Not everything, but enough to implicate us. You said the worm was untraceable. Yeah, to civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the da Vinci virus. - And then they'll all be put away. - Launch the da Vinci virus? You can't do that. No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll belong gone with all of our money. Look, there is no right and wrong. There's only fun and boring. A 30-year prison sentence sounds pretty dull to me. Who do you prefer serves it... Us or them? Unless $5 million are transferred to the following numbered account in seven days, I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson fleet. The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30, and those hackers tried to get into our system again. At this point, I insist you take more strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will hold the Secret Service responsible. Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias "Acid Burn," Emmanuel Goldstein, alias "Cereal Killer," Dade Murphy, alias "Crash Override," also known as "Zero Cool," and Paul Cook, alias "Lord Nikon." We pick them up tomorrow morning at 9:00. Snoop onto them... As they snoop onto us. - Yeah, it's Kate. - Hey, Burn, we got a little problem here. - All right, so what have we got? - Well, we have 50 passwords, plus whatever "Polaroid-head" here got inside Ellingson. Well, I got a lot, all right? I don't know how many, but... my head hurts. Yo, yo, yo, check this out. - Hey, what's "da Vinci virus"? - What? Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happen on the 14th. What oil spills? Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the 13th. Well, this hasn't happened yet. Wait a minute. The 14th... that's the same day the worm ends its run. I mean, da Vinci virus... Didn't Phreak say that's what he's being charged with? Look. "infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers." - They blame hackers. - Damn! A worm and a virus? The plot thickens. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going, huh? I got an idea. Look, we got a few hours, right, till we get arrested? So just stay low. I'm gonna go get some help. I'll beep you, okay? Shit. Are you coming? May the Force be with you, man. There they are! Razor and Blade? They're flakes! They're elites. Let's get 'em. Good morning, Vietnam! Ha-ha! Aw, yeah. This is once again the man that threw this party. I'm doin' this. My style is quadruple damage for MCs. I'll make 'em huff 'n' puff like mufflers from Meineke. Human exhaust, you wanted to get lost. Rhymes plus Exxon ride brains like Alain Prost. You MC clowns, I blaze towns. I dragwheel skulls I leave with speed and dust clouds... - Hey, come on, get off the stage. - Razor and Blade... I gotta talk to those guys. Hey, hey, hey! Jive and babble, throw heavy Scrabble. Sparkles plus the bubbles plus the flavor like Snapple. All you so-called rebels, heavy-metal cattle. Some horses got force, but I simply tame with saddle... You struggle with my tempo, you ain't got good grief! Brothers amazed, keep 'em all in a daze. With the wild funk blaze, good grief! I lost them. Where were you? I don't like this. I definitely don't like this. What do you want? Um... we come in peace? We need your help, if you're up to it. She's buff, ballsy. - Let's keep her. - Waste the dude. A virus called da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time tomorrow. It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money. We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the da Vinci virus and download the worm program. She's rabid but cute. See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show. Let's go, Kate. Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to need more than just two media icons like us. You need an army. That's it... an electronic army. If I were us, I'd get on the Internet, send out a major distress signal. "Hackers of the world, unite." How are you gonna take care of the cops? Yo, I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand Central. Let's hit it. The light is green! You're the man, baby. You're the man! Hey, Joey, you made it! Joe! Joey! All right, listen up. Use your best viruses to buy us some time. We have to get into Plague's file and copy the worm. All right, that was a little tension-breaker. That had to be done, all right? - Cereal? - Yeah? - Go fix the phones. - Roger. Joey, take his place. - What, me? - Take his place, man. Do it. - You can do it. Just do it. - Cereal, we're counting on you. - Just do it. - Ready? - Yeah. - All right, let's boot up. - I'm shut down completely. - Green light. When the green light's blinking, there's something wrong. My computer just crashed. Printers... Oh, my God...! I don't know. Viruses everywhere. What is it? What's wrong? Nothing. It's just a minor glitch. A minor glitch with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe. - There's a new virus in the database. - What's happening? It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do? Type "cookie," you idiot. I'll head them off at the pass. We have a "zero bug" attacking all log-in and overlay files. Run antivirus. Give me a systems display. Now we've lost sections 6 through 26. No, make that 10 to 40. - And 1 through 6. - Die, dickweeds. A rabbit is in the administration system. - Send a flu shot. - Rabbit? Flu shot? Someone talk to me. A "rabbit" replicates till it overloads a file, - then it spreads like cancer. - Cancer? Row, row, row your boat. Gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily. Life is but a dream. - Row, row, row your boat... - Whoa. Crawling halt. It's the Gibson. It's finding us too fast. Man, there's too many garbage files. I need more time. They're at Grand Central Station, lower level. Don't screw up. Go! Get out of here! Everybody, let's move! - Move it! - Let's go! Get the hell out of the way. Come on. 30 seconds. Move it. Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence. You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit. Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole. - Give it up. - Three minutes to capsize. Just give it up. Are we fashionably late? Okay, let's go. Okay. Si, sono pronta. Andiamo. We have massive infection, multiple GPI and FSI viruses. It's coming in from remote nodes. They're going for the Kernal! - "Colonel" who? - The system command processor. - It's the brain. - Cancer, brain. Brain, cancer. - Belf, what's going on? - In short, Duke, a shitstorm. Move! Go! Move! Move! Move! Did they call the police...? Get out of the way! I found it. I found it! This is the end, my friend. Thank you for calling. Oh, shit. He got me. Yo, Joey's getting stupid busy. Come on, out of my way, my man. Joey, I need you to drop your virus, go after the worm. - You're the closest. - Out of the way, people! It's "root, slash, period, workspace, slash, period, garbage, period." Out of the way! Let's go. Out of the way! Out of the way! Get out of the way! Freeze! Aw! Oh, come on! Ha! All right. Good job. - Kill the Gibson. - Roger that. Come on, you son of a bitch. Is that all you got, huh? Come on! Let's see what else you can do! You talking to me, huh?! Are you nuts? Come at me. They're in the Kernal. Help me...! The tankers have stopped capsizing. The ballast tanks are empty. We should be okay. Little pissant. Yes! - We did it. - Let's get out of here. Freeze! Train departing track number 24... Keep it moving. Come on, come on. What are you waiting on? Let's go. They're trashing our rights, man! They're trashing the flow of data! They're trashing! Trashing! Trashing! Hack the planet! - Hack the planet! - Shut up and get in the car. Hack the planet! Hack the planet! - Hello? - We caught them. - Good. - Red-handed. You won't be having any more trouble from them. Me, all right? I did it. She knows shit about computers. She's just my girlfriend. I suggest you modify your attitude, because you are floating and I'm about to flush your ass. You've got a Mrs. Murphy to see you, sir. Are you crazy? What are you doing? I'm trying to help you. - Dade. - What? Thanks for your help. Your son is in big trouble. He has violated his probation and he has engaged in criminal activity. My son happens to be a genius. He understands something happening today that you won't comprehend if you live to be a hundred. And he would never use what he knows to harm a living soul. The news crew you requested is here. Oh, good. 'Cause I have a few things to tell them. Your son is facing 30 felony counts in an ongoing investigation. You face possible arrest if you do that. Mister, I don't care if I face certain death. Mrs. Murphy stays right here. Oh, wow. She's great. Yeah. And attacked the Ellingson's computer network. Is this the last we've seen of this type of high-tech espionage? Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave threat to the national security. This incident just proves without a doubt that we need increased funding to stop... - Hold on. We're getting interference. - Hola, boys and girls. - It is I, the Cereal Killer... - Get that clown off. Making my first coast-to-coast worldwide global television appearance. Yes, that's right. I'm here to tell you about this heinous scheme hatched from within Ellingson Mineral. But for what, you ask? World domination? Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called da Vinci, that, when launched, would cause Ellingson mineral tankers to capsize, was to be blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was really the smokescreen, right? What could be so vitally important to protect - that someone would create... - How did he do that? Such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program? But Why? Could it be to cover the tracks of this worm program... A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks? The password to this hungry little sucker belongs to Margo Wallace, - head of Public Relations... - Oh, my God...! And Eugene Belford, computer security officer. - Son of a bitch! - Oh, my...! Oh! What's this? ls this the unnamed account in the Bahamas where the money was to be stashed? I think so. Unlucky! Yo, I kind of feel like God. Plague...? Eugene?! A comedy of errors... I don't even know how to work the VCR, let alone a computer. Get off! Look. Listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford... I know where his mother is. I promise you. Get off me. I need a lawyer! Thank you. Here you are, Mr. Babbage. Flight time to Tokyo should be about 14 hours today. Can I get you anything else? Just a pillow, please. Thank you. You're welcome. What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again! You look good in a dress. You would have looked better. Want to go for a swim? I can't believe they decided you won. They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway... you're pretty good. You're elite. Yeah? You know, if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble. Beat that. You know, I've been having these really weird... Dreams? I love you, I love you today. I don't care what. The world has to say. They don't know that. I love you. I love you today. I don't care what. The world has to say. They don't know that. Dreams escape from the fear. Built inside, in his heart. Bring me home, cast the net. Far and wide, I'll return. To the night, mask up front. Cast away, give me love. I don't care what the world has to say. You should know that I love you. I love you. I love you today. I don't care what. The world has to say. They don't know that. I love you, I love you today. I don't care what. The world has to say. They don't know that I'm in love. I can feel the eyes behind us. As we walk. I can see the ears that listen. When we talk. I don't care what the world has to say. You should know that I love you. I love you, I love you today. Can't you see how I feel? Like a cloud, conquer all. With the thoughts in my head. In my heart, love is real. Can't you see how I feel? Like a cloud, conquer all. With the thoughts in my head. In my heart, once again. Can't you see how I feel? Like a cloud, conquer all. With the thoughts in my head. In my heart, love is real...
