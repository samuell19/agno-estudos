(upbeat jazz music) - You know what? I want you to wait a minute. I forgot something at the bar, okay? - [Woman] What is it? - It's a surprise. - Hurry back. - Rafael Zolan? - Yeah? - Get him! (soft music) - Want to play a game? - Lover, for another 100 bucks, we can do anything you want. - That's good. - You ready? - I don't know. (horn honking) - Hey baby, hey. (siren in the distance) - Hey hey hey, hello mama. Come here. How's my sweetest thing? - I'm scared Paul. - Now look, now be sweet. All right, sweet thing? Come on, do it. - Hey baby, let's go make a party. - You got money? - Sure do. Come on, I ain't got all night. - No. No! - Hey, where do you think you're going? Mama, you cost me money. Look, you said you'd do this for me. Now you gotta do it. - I can't Paul. - That's enough. - Hey hey, no problem my brother. - Luanne, your mother sent me. She wants you to come home. - I'm gonna send you both back home to Mom. - The broken nose is for the girl. The vasectomy's free.

Do you think My Love could make it to number one? - If my dress is short enough in the video, it might. - Are you still planning to tour Europe later this fall? - Well yes sugar, 'cause the boys there are so hot for me. - And what about an American tour? - I think I could spank up some interest in that. - Are you going to renew your contract with Eddie Deangelo at the end of the month? - We make no public statements about contracts. - How long have you known that Eddie Deangelo's record label has mob connections? - No comment. - God, I'm burnt. How do you think it went? - You were fantastic, they loved you. - No, really? - Really. - You know after all this time, it still makes me really hot to feel proud like that, you know? It's like payback for all the bullshit. - You mean Deangelo? - Him, my father, everything. - I have a feeling everything's gonna turn out just fine. - Yeah I noticed you've been stupidly optimistic since Eric proposed. - I can't help it, that's what happens with true love. - I wouldn't know. - What's that? - Some punk's idea of good taste in greeting cards. (screaming) (confused crosstalk) - Nice kick, Jerome. Okay, class break. Sit down from sparring. All right, Juan, let's work on your throws. Hands up. On your stance. - Jack Dillon? - I'm Dillon. - This is Shanna. I'm Barbara Glen. A friend of your-- - Excuse me. That's all for today, class. See you Saturday. - You finished? - Shanna. - Look lady, I don't know what your problem is, and I don't care. - See I told you this was a bad idea. Why don't we just split? - Wait a minute. Listen Mister Dillon, if you give me one minute, I'll explain to you why we're here, and then if you still want us to leave, we'll go. - Go ahead. - A Lieutenant Sturges recommended you to us. - We used to be partners. - So he said. You know, the Wall Berlin? - Yeah, it's a yuppie club on the west side. - It's the place for hot new rock acts to appear. Shanna started there last night. - Congratulations. - After the show, there was a box in the dressing room. - There was a woman's finger in the box, with the ring still on it. - What did Sturges think? - That it's just some wacko showing his love or something. - If the police are on this case, what do you need me for? - Protection. - Look, I'm not a bodyguard, stick with the police. - Shanna doesn't like cops. - I used to be a cop. - Yeah, but you quit, why? - I had my reasons. What do you have against cops? - My father was a cop. - So was mine. - Your father rape you? (phone ringing) - Excuse me. Hello? - Hello Jack, it's Sturges. - [Jack] Hi Will, what's up? - Listen, I need a favor. - [Jack] Shoot. - I've got a multiple homicide at the Rand Inn, six stiffs in one room. They were all beaten to death. I'd like you to come over and take a look. - I can meet you there in 15 minutes. - Great, by the way, did that rock star show up? - She's here now. - [Will] Good, have her go over to the station, I'll meet her there. - All right. That was Sturges, he wants you to meet him at headquarters. - So, will you take my case? - Go to the station, I'll call you later. - Come on, Shanna. - Jack, Jack. Thanks for coming down. - Sure. - Good to see you again. Listen, the bodies were discovered this morning. I just got here myself. It's up on the fourth floor, I'd like you to take a look. - Hey Sean? - Lieutenant. Hey Jack. Bad news, some reporter was here when this broke. One of the guys says it's all over the radio. - Great, now every wacko in the state's gonna come claim credit for this. - Jack, good to see you. You back? - Just observing Carl, what's you got? - Five guys, all packing iron, all of them killed by blows to various vital spots on their body. Not one of them got their gun out except for this guy. He got a broken arm for his trouble to go with his broken neck. - You mind? - Be my guest. - What do you think? - Martial arts expert. Professional killer. - What time did they die? - We won't know for sure until the autopsy, but judging from the lividity of the limbs, one a.m.? - What about the woman? - 3, 3:30. - What woman? - You haven't been next door? - No. - We think it's the same guy, even thought the MO's different. You had breakfast yet? - No. - Good. - Jesus. - Are you okay? - Yeah, it's just been a while. - Welcome back. - The guy who visited the rock club last night left the same calling card. - [Man In Hall] Hey ma'am you can't go in there. This is police business. - Shanna, we're going to the chapel. - Oh my God. - Look at me. You're going to be okay. Come on. Better? - How'd you know we were at the hotel? - The radio. They were screaming about this murdered woman, and a queen of spades left on the body. I just wanted to see for myself. - You did. - I'm really scared. Will you protect me, please? - Yes. - Thank you. My real name's Carrie. Carrie Farland. - Glad to meet you, Carrie Farland. - So, what do you think? - You own this place? Nice. - Thanks. - What's up Carrie? - Hey, I brought a friend. - Hello. - Hi. - Listen, I gotta go take a shower. We need to be up in Hollywood at eight for that rehearsal, okay? - Shanna convince you? - She helped. - She usually does. Well make yourself at home. Dinner'll be ready in a few. - You live here? - We grew up together, best friends. - And now you work for her? - I watch out for her. - That makes two of us. (doorbell ringing) I'll get it. Will, what's up? - Hey. I thought you'd like to know, we ID-ed those five stiffs at the hotel. One of them was Rafael Zolan, local guy. He and his brother Emil, made the big time as arms dealers. - Let's pay the brother a visit in the morning. - You got it. And the lab tested that finger, it belonged to the female victim at the hotel. She was a hooker. - Same guy did both murders. - Still drawing a blank on these cards, though. - Will, do me a favor, hold the fort here. There's someplace I gotta go. I'll meet you at the video studio. - Wait a minute, what do I look like, a fuckin' babysitter? You're welcome. (tense piano music) - Have you seen anybody in here lately with one of these? - We don't give out information about our friends here, especially to foreign-looking creeps like you. - How about you? (laughing) Is that a no? Anybody else? (upbeat rock music) - Get him. - Now I'm tired, and pissed off. Tell me who that guy was, or I'm gonna finish my dental work. - All right, all right all right. I'll tell you, his name is John, John Sweet. - Where does he live? - I don't know. Jesus Christ come on, let me go, I don't know. He comes in here twice a week with the rest of those war jocks. - What about the card? - It's a deadhead card. In Vietnam we used to put in on the bodies of the dead Cong. Used to scare the hell out of them. - If you're lying to me, I'm coming back. - [Man] All right people let's clear the set for this rehearsal. - Song's called Love Rocket. - Everything okay? - Yeah, but where the hell have you been? - I found out who our boy is, John Sweet. About six five, blonde hair, 250 pounds. - All right, I'll call it in. - Hey Will? Thanks. I owe you one. - Yeah, well call my wife, tell why I didn't make dinner. - It wouldn't help. - You're right. - Jack Dillon, this is Bobby Machado. He manages me, in more ways than one. - So, you're a cop, huh? - Ex-cop, yeah. - You can do this job? Protect my baby? - Shanna thinks so. She hired me. - Now, I'm asking you. - I can do the job. - You better. Hey, what the hell's the stall, huh? I ain't paying you turds to screw around all night. - Sorry Mister Machado, you said to wait for Mister Deangelo. - Screw Mister Deangelo, if he can't get his ass in gear, then-- Hey hey, hey hey. - Bobby. Ah, princess. Hello princess. You're all right? - Oh, yeah Eddie, fine, sure. - They're gonna catch this scum, this finger business is terrible. Now look, if you need anything, anything at all, you just let Eddie know. - Yeah, okay Eddie, sure. Jack Dillon, Eddie Deangelo. My back. - Mister Deangelo and I have met. Five years ago, wasn't it Eddie? - Yeah, yeah, a long time ago. - A big money-laundering bust. - Yeah, right. A misunderstanding as I recall. Charges were brought, charges were dropped. Water under the bridge, huh? C'est la vie. You're pushing me, Dillon. - So push back. - Hey come on, the guy's just jerking your chain. Let's get this rehearsal done, okay? Come on. - Right, of course. You're right Bobby. We'll watch from the booth. - So you still want me on this case? - Especially now. - Welcome to the zoo.

Now he wants to collect back. Is that so wrong? - No, what's wrong is, he's the same kind of scum I've been trying to get away from since the day I was born. - Yeah, well that scum bought us this big expensive house you like so much. He even bought these designer rags you're wearing. - Bullshit, Bobby. I bought this stuff, with my body, and with my voice. He doesn't own me, and neither do you. This isn't your affair. - I'm making it mine. - This is a family matter, and you're not family. - I'll be in my truck. - You better get your head straightened out, because I'm not gonna put up with this bullshit. - Oh yeah? Well the front door will be locked when you get back. (car starting) (tires squealing) There's something you should know about Bobby and I. We've been lovers off and on for about eight years. - That give him the right to hit you? - He took me away from my father. Maybe saved my life. - So why'd you come out here? - I'm inviting you back in. - I'll pass. - You are a real gump. - I just need a little bit more time. The big problem is, this guy Dillon she hired. The son of a bitch. Eddie, she would have already signed except for that fuckin' detective sticking his nose in. - Bobby, relax. This pacing back and forth, you're giving me indigestion, all right sit down. Now look, you need another 24 hours, you got it. But remember, I stand to lose two million dollars that I invested in her. My people aren't gonna like that. All right? - I can convince her Eddie. - I hope so Bobby, I hope so, for both our sakes. That bitch isn't gonna sign. Call Jeremy, tell him to set a hit. - Just the woman? - No. No, I want Dillon too. And Dino, tell 'em I want her ring finger. No guns. It should look like the psycho did it. (ominous orchestral music) - All right, now Lynn, you take three and go in through the front. John, you take two and go in through the back. Now you kill everybody in the house. - Remember, quick and clean, and don't forget the trophy. - Wait here. (dramatic orchestral music) - Shanna! - What the hell was that? - I don't know, let's get out of here. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Call the police. - Is Barbara okay? - She's fine. Just make the call. (siren in the distance) (dispatcher on police radio) - Sergeant, tell forensics I need a report as soon as they can get it to me, okay? - Yes sir. - That's quite a mess. She's getting to be awfully popular. Did you recognize any of them? - No, but they were pros. - Any idea who did it? - Yeah, but I can't prove it. - Who killed the three in the back? - What? - That's another thing. Sweet was here. He took out the three. - Why? - He's protecting Shanna, saving her for something. - I'm gonna park a car here, just in case he comes back. But you'd better find another place to keep them. - We'll stay at my place. - That's trouble. (smacking) - I borrowed a shirt. - I noticed. It never looked that good on me. (doorbell ringing) That must be Will. Morning Will. - Morning. Hi. - I've gotta go. - Go where? - We're checking out some leads on Sweet. - There's two plain-clothes officers parked in a white car across the street. - Look, just lock the door after we leave. You and Barbara stay until I get back, okay? - I called, Zolan's at the warehouse. I didn't notice the boyfriend at your house last night. - He stayed at a hotel. He and the girl are fighting. (tires screeching) - Ignorant pinhead. - Glad to see you've become a low-stress driver, Will. - With that babe at your house, you should talk. - Anything new on Sweet? - Yeah, I ran him through the FBI computer. His father's from Weisbaden, Germany. He lived there till he was 10, then he came here to live with his mom. When he was 12, his mother was raped and killed in front of him. He killed the rapist with his own knife. - Did the rapist cut off the ring finger? - Yeah. He joined the special forces when he was 18, martial arts expert. Then he disappeared for 10 years. He resurfaced most recently in Angola. - Mercenary. - Yeah. He was arrested in Angola in conjunction with a murder of a prostitute. Her ring finger was severed. He was released for lack of evidence. - And now he wants Shanna. - It's not just another case to you, is it? - No. - In here. - Who the hell are you? Get out of my office now, or I'll call the police. - I am the police. - Then I'll call my lawyer. - We don't have time for that. - We want Sweet. - I don't have to tell you nothing. Don't touch that, that's pre-Colombian. - Look, Sweet killed your brother and four bodyguards two nights ago, why? - I don't know what you're talking about. - It's nice. - Looks priceless. - Oh no. - It is now. - Sweet'll kill me if I tell you anything. Please, no, no. Rafael hired him to lead a revolt on Angola. And everything blew up when the Cubans stepped in. And Rafael withdrew his support. - And left Sweet and his friends holding the bag. - So Sweet came back to America to find Rafael. - And to kill women. - Sweet's address, now. - All right, all right. - Now. - It's Sweet's best friend. It's a guy named Rene. And if anybody can find him, he will. Here.

Hey. - I got Will Sturges killed this afternoon. - Who did it? - Sweet. - Is there anything I can do? - Just leave me alone. - Jeremy, Jimmy. I hire you guys because you're supposed to be the best. End up with six dead, and the bitch and Dillon are still breathing. - Well, no excuses Mister Deangelo, but Dillon broke lucky. He was out in his car and got in behind us. It was a fluke. - Fluke, my ass. You stupid son of a bitch. Now I want her dead, before 10 o'clock tonight. You capiche? - You leave it to us, Mister Deangelo. We'll handle it personal this time. - That's good, that's good, because if you don't, I am gonna take a gun, shove it up your ass, and blow your brains out. Wipe that silly smile right off your face.

Hey look, you don't like me, I don't like you, whatever. You gotta understand how the vibe is with me and Shanna. See she, she likes all that rough stuff. Sure, I get mad and smack her around once in a while, but that's her thing. It really makes it hot, you know what I mean? - If you lay hands on her again, I'm gonna break 'em off and ram 'em down your throat.
