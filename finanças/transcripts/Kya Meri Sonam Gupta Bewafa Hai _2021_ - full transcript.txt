"God is the greatest." "God is the greatest." 'Okay, let's tell you a story.' 'A significant tale from a small town.' 'You know how it is? Stories are born out of incidents.' 'And incidents are born in these convoluted alleys.' 'Often, these incidents take birth and die in the alleys.' 'But some incidents leak out into the markets and crossroads.' 'And some stories, manage to hop into buses and trains.' 'There is no looking back.' 'An incident turns into a story, and the story turns into a book.' 'And on occasions, incidents travel from books to the movies.' 'Such a story,' 'by the name of Sonam's Betrayal is languishing in many a pocket,' 'as a pertinent question?' 'Currency notes with the tag Sonam Gupta is a deceiver,' 'are available here.' 'Actually, it all started... Do you see that house?' 'Right here. Yes, right here.' 'Today is the day' 'when the only heir to Pinte Bhaiya's family was born.' 'The baby was affectionately called, Surinder.' 'But people to came know him by the nickname, Sintu Bhaiya.' 'The child had not yet opened its eyes to the world' 'but his mother...' 'Wanted to know his entire future.' The planet Venus will have a great influence on the boy's life. The boy is born with the destiny of a king. His wife will be a vision of the Goddess Laxmi. A flourishing business... He will contribute significantly to social causes. He will grow up to be an important man. 'That's it. After this prediction,' 'the boy was looked after, as though,' 'he was not born, but had appeared as a divine being.' 'The prime contribution towards turning this incident into a story' 'was made by the priest from Mathura.' 'He was the one who for an amount of fifty-one hundred rupees,' 'brushed a peacock feather on Mr. Gupta's wife's baby bump,' 'and predicted, she will give birth to a boy.' 'And that is what Mr. Gupta wanted.' 'But a daughter was born to him, instead.' 'Now, Mr. Gupta was more angry than frustrated.' 'But before he could say anything to the priest...' 'The holy man made another prediction,' 'and that too free of cost.' Hey, she is the spitting image of Goddess Laxmi. Hey, she is that divine reflection of the Goddess Laxmi, which, even I could not have foreseen. This child will make you proud one day. And after that, you will never feel the need to have a son. 'Anyhow.' 'After this prediction, the parents started looking after the girl,' 'just as a middle class family looks after their savings.' Hey, don't bathe with cold water. I am warming the water. I will just get it. I won't bathe with warm water, it makes my skin dry. Just hand me the towel. Will you lift the bucket? Hey, dear. I have kept the bucket of warm water here. Pick it up. Okay, fine, papa. And, here. Take your towel. Just wait for a second. Take it, dear. Here, hold it. Hey, who is calling you early in the morning? Don't receive the call, papa. They are calling from the company. They will deduct the money, the minute you receive the call. Listen. - Yeah? I don't like this girl's ways. I say, let's arrange her wedding quickly. Hmm. - Yes. Why should I arrange her wedding? I would rather you get married. After all, your ways are not too good, either. He wants to marry my daughter off! Have you forgotten the prediction of the priest from Mathura? My daughter will make us proud. London... Paris. Get her married, indeed! My foot... She will go! How will she go when I will not give her a single penny? What do you think, Mr. Gupta? Won't I be able to go, if you don't foot my bills? You are very naive. Did you see that? She has turned out to be like you. She is addressing her father by name! And she whistles at me? What sort of behaviour is this? Take it. Go out and do your work. Broom the terrace. Huh! On the one hand, she has earned a name, and now, the daughter will become famous! Darn! Huh! "Dear, God, you are the divine giver..." "I am ignorant, and seek your blessing, oh, lord!" "Victory to you, oh, lord of the universe." "You remove the difficulties of your devotees..." "I am a disco dancer..." "I am a disco dancer." - "I surrender myself at your feet" "Victory to you, oh, lord of the universe." "Remove my doubts and sorrows, oh, lord!" "Take me under your protection." "I am madly in love with someone." I am telling you. Stop all this right now. Why are you disturbing me? Can't you see Sintu is dancing? "Come on, groove and sing with me. I am a disco dancer." "Whoever sings the lord's praises..." "I am a disco dancer." 'Why did you go upstairs?' - Witch! Hey, why are you bothering my son? You may not feel disturbed! I have to pursue an education. I am the one who suffers! You don't even let me pray in peace! Huh? She is always after my son! 'She will bring us a bad name, in her in-law's house.' 'What else?' 'People will say that the mother hasn't taught her anything.' Hey, Gupta is here. 'When Laxmi Surobhi Sonam Gupta started growing up,' 'she began to attract a lot of male attention.' 'Mr. Gupta would seek a transfer every year' 'and move to a different city.' 'To keep Laxmi from going astray.' 'And so, this time Mr. Gupta has landed in the city of Bareilly.' Sintu Bhaiya! - Yeah, coming. Come soon. - 'Sintu!' Sintu, finish this, and then you may go. If you leave, then I will give you good. You have my swear. You have to eat it all. I am already late. I won't be able to eat it all. Hey, no. Eat. Eat it. And why do you turn up early in the morning, huh? Don't you have other work? All thanks to you, my Sintu is turning into a brat. I am here for his work, auntie. What can I say? Take. Carry this with you. Make sure he eats it all. He has no other work. He keeps hanging around my Sintu! And what are you lazing around for? Work faster. Very good, Mr. Gupta. Go for it! Sonam! Hey! Sonam! Sonam! What is your mother saying? - Shh! 'Take your veil!' - Hey, your veil! - Shh! 'Hey! Girl!' - Do you want to wear a veil? Keep walking. We haven't heard anything. Look at that! She left her veil at home! What? Hey! Forget about her veil, manage your own, veil, first! Go! Go inside! Get in - Hey, what about the veil? Hey, Kundan, today we are really late. I have a feeling she must have left. Huh! What do you mean? You have been following her for twenty days, she doesn't even look at you! And I don't think she will ever look at you! How many times have I told you not to say negative things to me? You always talk negative! If I follow her with sincerity, she will surely look at me one day. Yes, buddy. She will look at you. Why are you getting upset? 'According to Sushma,' 'the most handsome son in the world, Sintu,' 'is an adult now.' 'According to the prediction,' 'there is no sign of any achievement or fame,' 'but yes, he is already ten years late in finding a girl' 'like the Goddess Laxmi.' She is the most beautiful girl in Bareilly. Hey, I am also, the most handsome boy in Bareilly. Is it? 'Why don't you add onions? Add some more.' What's wrong? I never thought so! Dear God, if Sonam Gupta steps into my shop just once... I will make an offering worth eleven rupees. You will strike gold! The beautiful blue moon rises above the alley. What are you doing? - Dinner? Later. Didn't I tell you? Strange! Mom! - Yeah. - There she is. My child is home. Welcome. Welcome. - Is it a bank holiday? Are you alright? Everything is alright, when it comes to my daughter. Hey, what are you doing? - Hey, let her eat her meal. What is it? - Let her sign first. What is going on here? Will someone tell me? We will tell you. Dear, you have to sign here. - What is this? These are documents. You want to go abroad. So, I am making a fixed deposit for you. Mr. Gupta! - My child! Where do I sign? - My sweetheart. Here. - Yes, right here. So nice. Huh! Ha! Come on, serve the dinner. Quick. Hurry up! Lovely. - What is all this? Papa, I am telling you. This cheating won't work! Do you have a problem? Okay. From tomorrow you needn't go to college. And you will not step out of the house. Mom. - And she won't even get two square meals. Okay? Come on, let's eat. Very nice. Lovely. Sit here. You eat this food! What have you cooked? - Bitter gourd. Again... You have cooked your favourite dish. Hey, look... The monkey has stolen a vest from Pinte Bhaiya's shop. What happened? Hey, the monkey took the vest. Hey, these monkeys have wreaked havoc. Do one thing. - Yeah? Buy six or seven bananas, and give it to him. He may return it. - Okay. So, tell me, Sintu. What can I do for you today? Do something nice. I am going for important work. Hey, Sintu Bhaiya is synonymous with large. Sintu, I have got a miraculous item, that will make you look like a twenty-eight-year-old youth. Son, get the item for a twenty-eight-year-old boy. But I am twenty-six? Oh, yes. Son, get the item for a twenty-two-year-old. Very good. Bring it here. Show it to Sintu Bhaiya. Take a look, Sintu Bhaiya. Choose any one. Javed, what have you done to my hair? My family members refuse to recognise me. Your hair looks good, buddy. They aren't recognising you because of your face! Do one thing. Go home and tell them your name. I am sure they will recognise you. Go, go, go, go. go. Javed, it is my wedding day, today. Hey, why are you taking stress? His face was at fault! You are a good looking man. Sit. Hey, Sintu Bhaiya, which colour should I apply? Javed, forget the colour, just give me a shave. Just a shave? - Yes, just a shave. Fine, I'll give you a shave. Great, she is sitting here and applying oil. Hey, come down quickly. The girl's family is here. And bring her along. Sintu! Sintu! Hey, I haven't seen a crazier woman than you in my life! You won't even get a dowry for the amount you have spent on snacks! Hey, grandma, why are you raising your BP? Let it be. Take, please have. Hey, madam. The girl is very beautiful. Yes, yes. That she is. But she is a little dark, isn't it? Ahem, actually, it is tough to get a good match for dusky girls. But, my Sintu is as fair as milk. But no worries, we can ignore such things if the dowry is good. What else? There... Our Sintu is here. Come, son. Come, come. Come. - Greetings. Sit. Sit, son. Sit. Hey, Tanu, get a cold drink for your brother. My Sintu doesn't drink tea. So, what are your educational qualifications? I have completed my twelfth standard. Why? Why didn't you complete your graduation? Hey, what is the need for graduation? All this belongs to him. And anyway, children tend to leave the nest if they study too much. And, I cannot live without my Sintu, even for a day. Ahem... Ah... He will start a lucrative business. Son, what are your hobbies? Breaking dance and listening music. Look, madam, even if our daughter dies a spinster, she will never marry your son. And, anyway, our dusky daughter, is much better than your ugly son, Sintu. Let's go from here? - What nonsense are you talking about? Huh? How dare you say such things about my son? Hey, if you get a groom like my Sintu, then I will change my name! Hey, did you hear what she said? Hey, Sintu! I am ill-fated! I have a feeling I will not see my daughter-in-law in this life. You will get married after my death! Go ahead, get the house painted! Huh! Hey, ask her to keep quiet! All she needs is an opportunity to sprinkle salt on wounds. She talks rubbish! Hey! They also left like the others. - Don't cry. I swear on my motherland. I will get married in the next two months. And too, a love marriage. Buddy, she looked at you and smiled. Huh. - You were right, buddy. If you work with sanitary, then you can get the work done. It is not sanitary, it is sincerity. Hey, whatever it is, buddy. I hope I can get her phone number. We will get it, buddy. - Come on. Sure. We will get you her number today. You do one thing, you go ahead. I'll join you later. - God, you heard my prayer so soon. Keep the advance. - Yes, let's see what is new in your shop? This is the latest thing. Keep quiet and show me a blue pen. Yes, sure. 'The entire shop is yours.' - Brother, today I will show you my confidence. 'Here, take this.' - 'Hmm.' And this... What is it Sintu bhaiya? What do you want? We are here to buy some stuff. Both of you just stand aside for a while. Brother, show me something that writes a bit softer. Yes, this one. Take this. This one is good. Yes, look at this. I'll show you more, till then you look at this one. Check it. Look at this. This... This... Take this one. 'This one's nice.' - Here, take this one. Ahem - Yes, this one. - This. Excuse me? Excuse me? Sonam. - Huh? Can you give me your contact number? Is it? Why? Hey, why do you want my number? Ahem... I don't want it, my friend wants it. Why? You want my number? - I... I don't want it. I came here to buy this pen. Do one thing. Both of you decide amongst yourselves, who wants my number? Then you can take it. And you, please, make a note of it, I will pay later. Oh, okay. One of these days, my father will chew me alive because of your antics! Got it? Don't talk too much, or else I will give you good one day. Hey, don't make my blood boil. So much for your confidence? Now, I'll show you. I got a bit nervous because there were so many girls. - Come on. Return my money, buddy! She was smiling. The scoundrels won't let me woo her. Papa, here. Have your breakfast. Otherwise, you will say you are late. Serve mine as well, I will also come. I haven't made breakfast for you. - Why not? Hey, every day you say, I will give it up tomorrow! I thought you would really give it up today. Hey, don't act smart with me. I know well, that you want me to starve to death! Hey, why are you throwing water at me? Am I invisible? Hey, I was pouring water on the plant. Yeah, pouring water, indeed! I know, all of you want me to die! Better speak to your mother. She is getting on my nerves! Hey, you are already crazy. Crazy woman. - Dear... Get out quickly. The environment at home is electric, as you can see. I will take out the scooter, okay. Yes, yes, papa. I am coming. Sonam. Fifty per cent of the boys in town are after you. Do you think anyone of them is fit for me? I think, all of them are good. Because you are... Cheap. You don't have a choice! Why are you standing here? Get inside. Come on. If I am late by a minute, you all start peeking out of the window! Sintu Bhaiya! Hey, Sintu Bhaiya. Please, park somewhere else. My father will be here any moment. You talk nonsense, buddy. Tell him, we came here to buy something. Buy a pen for ten rupees. Take. Give me a pen for ten rupees. This is a dairy shop, what can I offer you? Would you like to have sweet buttermilk? - No, no. Won't you accept? Brother. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Hey, run! Hurry up, brother. - Yes, I am trying. Run, brother! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait! Hey! - Hey! Hey, I am a confirmed bachelor. Sir, I don't know anything. Let me go. Let me go, sir. Hey, hey, hey. What happened? He is here to pick me up. Let's go. Hey! Sintu Bhaiya! 'Sintu Bhaiya!' - Where? Where should I drop you? Oh, yeah? Drop me to the place, you follow me every day. Come on, hurry up! Sintu Bhaiya! Sintu Bhaiya! Hey! Please, take me along. Look, today, I rescued you out there. But no one will be able to save your skin here. You wanted my number? Oh, you don't want it? - Yes, yes, I do. "I never had anything to call my own." "All that I have is because you exist." "Whether or not a third person cares for me?" "All that matters to me is you." "When you put your hands in mine," "the lines of fate on my palm began to glow." "I could not stop my heart from falling in love with you," "when your eyes looked at me lovingly."

"This is magical," "I feel you in every breath, I take." "There is a part of you," "in my laugh and in my tears." "I never had anything to call my own." "All that I have is because you exist." "Whether or not a third person cares for me?" "All that matters to me is you." Brother, how did you do it? Hey, what do you mean by how did I do it? All this while I never wanted it. And now that I wished for it, it happened. She loves me from the bottom of her heart. She, herself, gave me her contact number, buddy. Lies! Hey, I am not lying? Ask Kundan? Yes, of course. Why would Sintu Bhaiya lie to you? 'Cold drink!' - Should I show you his phone? She is here, buddy. Here you go. One large for Sintu Bhaiya. And the small bottles are for the boys. We will not have cold drinks, boy. - Why so? All of us will drink beer today. Brother, I won't be able to drink. - What? I am not well. Brother, we have relatives visiting us. Hey, why won't you drink? Won't you celebrate such a happy occasion? If not for me, have a drink for your sister-in-law's sake. After all, today she found her one true love! Yeah! - Yes. Bhole, run fast and get beer for everyone. - Sure. Go. go, go. - One, two, three... Hey, why are you counting, just get two crates. I will just get it, brother. Oh, yeah! Brother... Today, we will party! Hey, rascal, keep it on the other side. Hey, what is your problem, huh? - Is it coming towards you? Listen, I know exactly, why are you so upset? Well it was meant to be. In fact, my natal chart also, mentions that, I will marry a girl like the divine Goddess Laxmi. Now, you have found her, brother. Look at him. What happened? Hey, what is the matter with you? Nothing, brother. Your love story reminds me of mine. Is it? What is the name of the girl? Let it go, brother. The girl is a deceiver. Let's go. - Let's go. There are all sorts of girls. Sushma. Sushma. Keep snoring. You are least worried that Sintu hasn't come home yet. Sintu Bhaiya. - Yeah? Everyone has left. Let's go. I won't leave now. I will have a few more drinks. I am very happy today. - Okay, brother. Brother, give me the money for the cigarettes I bought for you. I have no money. Here. Keep all of it. It is not the entire amount. It is just ten rupees. You are something, brother. I had only ten rupees in my pocket, so I gave it to you. The prince is here. Listen. Wait. I'll open the door. Hey, I am coming. Hey, this bulb! It starts fluctuating every day! Come in, prince charming. He has come home now! Wait a minute. Where were you all this while? I have been waiting for you? How many times have I told you to go to bed? Hmm. Go to bed, indeed! I am the only one in this house who waits up for you. Wait, I'll get your dinner. I had my dinner. Have you been drinking? - No. No, mom. I did not drink alcohol. I drank fruit beer. Fruit beer? - Yes. Oh, I see. Sintu. Get some fruit beer for me as well. The doctor has advised me to eat fruits. Then I will drink some fruit beer, every day. "God is the greatest." Hello. Hello. The guys from the company know no limits. They keep calling. Dear. Give me your phone. I will teach these guys from the company, a lesson. Mom. Hey, why are you after her life? Do you get these calls? Look, don't talk rubbish. Great! Start fighting early in the morning. Eat your breakfast in peace. She is the one who started it. - Huh. I am the only one in this house, who has nothing to do with any company? Tell me something, are you crazy? If I am repeatedly disconnecting your call, you should understand, there is a reason. Mom and dad are sitting next to me, and you are constantly calling! 'Wow!' 'You have such a beautiful voice.' If I get one glimpse of you, and it makes my day. Stop talking so much. - Wow! Come out on the street, I will come up to the terrace. Hey, Sintu. Hey, for how long should we wait? Wake up! I am coming, mom. - 'When will he eat breakfast?' 'And then after that we will get to eat.' He is least bothered. I keep slogging all day! Hey, Won't you wake up? Do you plan to sleep all day? I was having such a nice dream. She woke me up! 'Wake up!' 'My throat is hoarse with shouting!' 'But no one cares tuppence.' 'My only aim is to keep doing housework all day!' 'If only someone would show some care.' 'Hey! Wake up!' 'Here. Keep the entire amount.' Hey! Sintu. Where are you rushing to, all of a sudden? I'll be back, mom. I have some urgent work. Where are you going and for what work? Show all that attitude to your wife. I will not tolerate your wayward ways. Who is here early in the morning? Sintu bhaiya? Return the money I gave you yesterday. You had given me ten rupees, brother. That is not just a ten rupee note. It is my life. Please, return it. I will give you a hundred in return. Brother, I used it to buy milk in the morning. You bought milk? - Yes. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey, Rajesh Khanna? Where are you going? I am going there. - Where? There, in the vicinity. - There, where? Ahem... That... That... - Where are you going? Hey, actually... I... I am looking for an address. What address are you looking for. The roads end here. Tell me? Actually... That... Hey, I have tackled boys like you since childhood. Son, I still have a lot of strength in these hands. Scoundrel! Hey, who is taking a beating? Hey, Sintu Bhaiya. That is Doodhiya. Ahem... Ah... But... - Scoundrel! Shut up! Uncle... I... I am... - Do you think I don't know why you are here? Uncle, listen to me please. This Doodhiya is in trouble. Let's get out of here. We can come back later. All you can do is bother girls! No, no, no, no... Listen to me. - What? This. - What is this? - Here, here take a look at the number. She asked me to come here. - Who? This one. Sonam. Hey, Sonam. The mobile company is giving out ten-rupee notes. Yeah, so keep it on the table. There she is. All the best. Move aside! Has he seen his face? No problem. It happens. Hey, Sintu Bhaiya! So, Sintu Bhaiya. I have heard that all the girls at the coaching centre are crazy about you? They are not interested in you. So, why are you here? There are one or two who have shown interest in me. And what about him? He has come here to pick his mother up. Hey! Don't act smart. Anyway, my mind is not stable these days. Hey, I was just kidding, buddy. It was a joke. - Don't pick up the topic. You fool, I was just kidding. I am in a bad mood, and to top it all, you have started this. Hey, so we will help you calm down. Hey, give Sintu a cold drink. Small or big? Hey, it's for Sintu Bhaiya. And Sintu is synonymous with large. Why do you keep calling me brother? Huh? I am probably a year or two younger than you. Respect. I had a cold drink. - Then eat something. No, buddy. - This tastes good. 'You are a scoundrel.' Yes, that I am. I will come to your shop at 4 PM tomorrow. Hey! Sonam! Sonam! Hey, what happened? Why are you shouting? I had kept a ten-rupee note here. Where did it go? I had kept a ten-rupee note here. Where did it go? - Hey! No! - I had kept it right here. Dad, I gave it to a different company. Well! Yeah! Set it right. The apple of his mother's eye! Whose card is this? Let me see. Show it to me. Hey, that Srivastav... - 'Where is your notebook?' It is an invite for an event at his house. We have to go to their place, tomorrow morning. I will not go to their place in this life. - Why? You go and get yourself humiliated. - Hu... All your life you will attend other people's foundation stone events. Will you ever buy a piece of land for yourself? Huh? You have a young unmarried son... But no... He has no worries at all! We don't even have a proper home. Yes, of course, as if you were born in a royal fort! Mom... Quiet. Look at her, with one leg hanging in the grave, but her tongue is sharper than the sword. Your feet are hanging in the grave. I can see them! Mother. - Quiet. Keep quiet! - What mother, mother? - Keep quiet. Do you want to fall sick? Yes. That's it! All you can for is yourself and your mother! Don't bother about my son, or the fact that he needs to start working? So, why doesn't he come and manage the shop? Have I asked him not to? I have told you a hundred times, My son will not sell underclothes, like you. Do you understand? So, what will he sell? Tell me? What will he sell? My son... - Yeah? Will have his own showroom in the marketplace. Do you know Mr. Subhash? Close to his shop. 'Control your scissor- like tongue...' 'This is the result.' Mom, why didn't you eat your dinner last night? Mom! I don't want to eat another meal in this house. You are so strange! You could have told me that you didn't want to eat. Why do you waste food? This family is full of weird people. Come son, sit. - Yes, sure. Sister. - Thank you, brother. You also sit. - Yeah, I will. Hey, Munni, get some tea, dear. Hey, why all this formality? Hey, brother. You have travelled so far... I am sure you are hungry. No problem. It's okay if you are not hungry. Come, dear. Keep the tea. Very good. Brother, some sweets for you. Yes, thank you. Put it in the fridge.

The groom's family is here and you, are lying here? Do you know who has come to our house? Do you know what the boy does? The boy is a teacher and a government servant, dear. Such people draw a pension, post retirement. Pension! Yes, so why don't you ask your daughter? Dear. Yes! Mr. Gupta, if you want me to marry someone who will draw a pension, so, give birth to another girl. Because I will not marry him. I should give birth to another girl? I should give birth to another girl! If I don't throw both of you out of my house, then I will change my name. - What did you say, Mr. Gupta? I will tell you, who will leave this house! Just you wait! - Hey! Where are you going? Hey! - Sonam, wait! Hey... What? - Oh! I think there is a monkey up there. Not a monkey, it's me. Hello, auntie. Hello, uncle. Who amongst you is here to marry me? You are so confident, buddy. But why, though? Oh! Will you draw a pension post-retirement? Wow! nice, buddy! Why don't you do something? When you start getting your pension, then come here to get married. Because it is possible, by then, I may decide to get married. But now, you better leave. Just a minute. I hope you ate the snacks? Yes, then please, leave. I said, get out! Let's go, let's go. - Come on, let's get out. I am glad we found out now, otherwise, only God could have saved us from this girl. Be careful father. - Brother! Sir! Please, listen to me. Hey, sister! I... I am very sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Okay, wait. Let me hail an autorickshaw for you. I... I... I am coming. Yeah, this will look nice. Don't you have something in golden colour? Something like... Something bright. No, look, we will get new stuff after Diwali. Hi. - Hi. Hi. - Hi. Here, take it. No, no. - Please, take it. No. - Please, take. Please, take. I am your brother-in-law. Why feel so shy? Take it. Listen, we will come and buy when the new stuff comes. None of them are nice.

Recharge? - Yes. For how much? Two hundred. - That's it? Do it for three hundred. - Yes, three hundred is fine. Write the number. 9814... - 532849. Hey, brother, she is my regular customer.

Thank you, brother-in-law. - Thank you, brother-in-law. There is no need to thank. - Thank you, brother-in-law. After all, this is your shop. Look after the shop. I'll be back. Actually, the car is a little small. Please, adjust. I'll buy a big car before the wedding. Where do you want to go? Let's go to the fair. "Lovers today have very little shame."

Move aside. I said, I don't want to eat. Why this drama? Eat your food? Didn't I tell you! I don't want to eat! Can you not understand at one go? I am on a hunger strike from today! Till someone builds a cottage for my Sintu... Till his showroom is ready... I will not touch a morsel of food till then! Mom, what you are doing is not right. Oh, so I am wrong? And everyone else in the family is always right? What he is doing in right? You all want me to die! Fine then, I will starve to death! At least, you all live in peace. Should I tell you what I want? Should I? Mother, let it go. Leave it. This woman's angst had reduced my life span or I would have lived for another hundred years. Son. Calm down, son. - You have your food. Water, water, water. - Let it be. Let it be. Give him some water. - Here, take. Eat something. - How can I eat? How do I eat? Eat something? - How can I eat. 'Medicine without an illness, and unwanted love...' 'Can be very harmful.' Show me the black top. Show me a plot. What will you do with the plot? Let me show you a cottage. It is a great buy at an affordable rate. Actually, I had some work. Forgive me, I am in the midst of something important. Okay. 'The simple-minded, Pinte Bhaiya,' 'always wanted that after him, his ancestral home and business,' 'should go to Sintu Bhaiya.' 'But that is not what Sushma wanted.' Hello, brother. - How much does the stuff cost? Eight. You have climbed up on the grain bags with your slippers on! Get off! Hey, take off your slippers. Count them. - Hello, sir. Greetings, brother. - Hello. Do you recognise me? I am Pinte. What are you saying, brother? The entire city swears by your name. Sit. Tell me, what brings you here? That... Actually, brother... What is this? These are the papers of my shop. I want to mortgage it. So, Pinte Bhaiya, why did you have to bring all this? Munna! - Yes, brother. Check this, son. How much money do you need? Brother, I need about ten lakhs. Ten is a bit too much, Pinte Bhaiya. Fine. I have a condition You must pay the interest on time. No, no. - Huh. You needn't worry about that. - Fine, fine, fine. Munna, take Bhaiya with you. And serve some tea. Huh, is that okay? Brother, I am very grateful to you. - Hey, please. Do not embarrass me. Please. Where are you taking me? I am taking you to get a divorce. Tanu! What is the need for divorce. I'll just go away. Wait. Come, come. Come in. Go and take a look. That's okay. Isn't it lavish? This is not a house. It is a mansion. These are your papers, Pinte Bhaiya. And these are your keys. Now, I will take your leave. Where will you break your hunger strike? Buy me snacks from Chauhan's shop. Have some. Eat it. Eat. Don't feel shy. Hey, Sonam. Dear, some Bhaiya is here to give you a card. Come down. She is calling you, Bhaiya. But she is looking at you. Yeah, tell me, son. Why are you organising this function? Actually, we have bought a new house. Is it? - This is to celebrate that. So, there must be many rooms? - 'Who is here, mom?' Hey, come here, dear. Look, this Bhaiya is here. Hey, Bhaiya. Hello. Hey, you have come empty-handed? No tea, no water? What don't you get the water, mom? I... I'll get it. - Yeah. Are you both crazy? What if papa had been at home? I know, he comes late. Aren't you too smart for your boots? What will you have? Tea, coffee, cold drink? He won't have anything. I would like to have some tea. Why would I bother for one person? Sit tight! Yeah, so what brings you here? I am organising a function for you. You must come. Mom is here. - Here, son. have some water. Tha... Thank you, auntie. Okay, so, let's go? - Yes. We will leave, now. - Hey, wait. Mr. Gupta will be home soon. Today is the second Friday. He will be home soon. Wait. Don't we have to go to the next lane? Yes, actually, we have to invite others also. We must leave. Hey, why do you want to leave? You had come to invite Mr. Gupta? Then you must personally hand it to Mr. Gupta. Sit. Hey, who wants to meet Mr. Gupta? - There, he is here. Hello, uncle. - Hello, uncle. Who are these boys? - We have come to give this card. What card? - Actually, it is an invitation. Sorry, I don't seem to recognise you? Who are you? I am Pinte Bhaiya's son. He sent me here and... And he Kundan, the son of, the priest, of the ancient Hanuman Temple. Our time will come. - Yes, it will. Sit, priest. - Hey, papa... This is the card? 'Come let's go, the Goddess has summoned us.' Got knows, who broke this? They will blame me, and Sintu Bhaiya will shout at me! He begins to shout at the drop of a hat! "I have stuck a wallpaper on my heart..." "Hey, wallpaper!" "Hey, a wallpaper with the Goddess's picture on it." "I have stuck a wallpaper on my heart..." "Ring the temple bells..." "Ring the temple bells, this is the Goddess's abode." "I have stuck a wallpaper on my heart..." "I have stuck a wallpaper on my heart..." Tell me? What is it? What took you so long? Do you know, I was feeling so lonely without you? Why would I have come early? What am I to you? You are the result of my twenty-six-year-old penance. Are you just twenty-six years old? Yes, I am twenty-six years old. I matured a little faster. So, I look a bit older. Anyway, what does your heart say? Who am I to you? Forget about what my heart says? - What? I this a dry function? Aren't you going to serve some beer? You? Do you drink beer? Are you crazy? I don't even touch it! On functions such as these, I take a sip or two. Wait for two minutes. I... I'll just get it. Hey, son. Listen - Yes? Ahem... Have you seen Sonam somewhere? She must be somewhere here. She must be praying, auntie. "The Goddess rides a lion..." "She wears a yellow sari..." "The Goddess rides a lion..." "She wears a yellow sari..." "The Goddess has graced everyone," "and now it is our turn." Now, tell me. Why were you calling me? I have bought a house for you. Both of us will stay here after the wedding. We will do everything according to your wish. But we will do one thing for my sake. "Yes, wallpaper..." "Hey, a wallpaper with the Goddess's picture on it." "I have stuck a wallpaper on my heart..." "Ring the temple bells..." "Ring the temple bells, this is the Goddess's abode." This will be our room. And I will install a huge bath tub, there. I will paint the walls red. And I will get red flowers... And I will see you in that red outfit. And what if I wear that red outfit for you, before the wedding? Will, you always say such sweet things? Sintu... I have a dream. Before getting married, I want to stay in a live-in. You... Don't do this. Actually... I have taken a vow on Goddess Vaishno's name... Huh? - Yes. What? - That I will go to Vaishno Devi first thing after the wedding. And only after that will I do something? What happened? And, what if I get you to break your vow today? Listen, you are tickling me. Sonam. Sonam, please. Hey, break your vow, Sintu. It is not the vow that will break. But two other things will. "I have stuck a wallpaper of the Goddess on my heart... " "I have stuck a wallpaper of the Goddess on my heart..." "I have stuck a wallpaper of the Goddess on my heart..." "I have stuck a wallpaper of the Goddess on my heart..." "I have stuck a wallpaper of the Goddess on my heart..." "Hail!" Why do you make all that sound, Sintu? This was my first time, actually. And what if it wasn't the first time for me? I will burn the world. I will commit suicide! Hey, hey, Sintu. I was kidding. You are! Come on, Let's go and listen to the story. Bye. Dear, Goddess, I did not break the vow. She wrecked it. Please, forgive me. Tanu. - Hmm? Hey, will he come after the girls' family reach here? Prince Sintu! I have woken him up, papa. He will come down. He will come, indeed! Hey, why have you invited a prospective brides' family? Why? I have fulfilled all your demands? Now, what is the problem? Tell me? Which demand is complete? The cottage is lying incomplete... The showroom hasn't started! The boy has not started working yet! The little money we could have got, we won't get that either. Sintu, you are here? And I have been looking for you? Hey, why did you throw it? I could have smoked! Don't talk rubbish! Smoke indeed! Okay, come down. A girls' family is coming to see you. Hey, I don't want to get married. Hey, you don't wish to marry, does that mean I should also not marry? Because of you, I am not getting married, Sintu. You know, I will go for a love marriage. Then do it. Who is stopping you? Call her. I will call her when the time is right. Listen. Call her before time slips out of your hand. Brother, please come in a queue. I want to talk to you. It will take two minutes. Uncle, I have something important to discuss with you. Go back. Stand in the queue. Oh, uncle, I think, you haven't recognised me? Please, go and stand in the queue. Please. Uncle, I am Pinte Bhaiya's son. I came to your house to invite you to the function. That's me. You had come to invite us for the function? Yes, uncle. I have to talk to you about something urgently. Why are you standing here then? Lunch hour. - Hey, Mr. Gupta? We will meet after lunch. - Hey, but... Oh! Yes? God bless you. - I am Sintu. Sintu. Yes, Sintu. Please, tell me. I am a bit confused. Should I call you uncle or papa? Don't get into the question of uncle or papa? People call me Mr. Gupta. You can also call me that. No problem. Actually, uncle. I and Sonam want to get married. Yes. Yes? Yes? Son, is Sonam aware of this? Yes, she knows. She must be shy of you. That is why she did not tell you. Yes. Does Sonam feel shy? Do one thing. Just give me some time. I'll inform you. God bless you. Thank you, papa. Now, I think I can call you, papa? Okay, I will begin with the arrangements. Okay. The ones from the company... They will stop now. How? What do you mean by how? Throw the mobile phone in the well. I will confiscate her mobile phone. She will not get to use the mobile. No college... She will not go to the college any longer. Okay, I am coming home. I'll talk to you later. No rubbish talk, please! Please, show me the catalogue for wedding dresses. For the groom or the bride? What do I come across as to you? Say that. - Show. Take a look. Hello, brother-in-law. - Hello. Hi. Where are you off to? Sonam? Sonam could not come. She has sent this letter for you. Okay, let's go. - Come on. Today you met my papa. He was happy to meet you. There are certain things I wish to discuss with you before the wedding. And Sintu, my phone is broken... That is why I am writing this letter to you. Sudhir Bhaiya keeps his gate open. You climb on to my terrace from his terrace. Why don't you return the girl's mobile? Quiet. I will give it. But not now. The groom's family are coming tomorrow. To see her. Let them see her. The boy is a ticket collector in the Railways. Once she gets married, I will return the mobile. After all, I don't need it! I trust my daughter more than you do. And more than that on the prediction made by the priest in Mathura. She will make us proud someday. Yes, of course she will make us proud, but after she gets married. Can she not make us proud after she gets married? I am very disturbed, Sintu. What happened? Didn't your father approve of me? Papa thought, you are very sweet. I hope your mother also thinks that I am sweet? But we won't be able to get married. Why? Sit, I'll tell you. Look, Sintu. My father wants me to marry a government servant. So, what is the big deal? I will get a government job. Are you a little crazy? Do you think a government job is a joke, and anyone can get it? So, won't we be able to get married? I... I will burn the world. What are you doing? I have thought of a solution. What? We may have to elope and get married. Elope? But what will happen to my mother? What sort of a husband are you, Sintu? Won't you be able to elope with your wife? You called me your husband? I guess, I will do it. Tell me, what should I do? Do you have some money? No. Listen, you arrange for some money. And I will arrange for some. And you give me all the money tomorrow. I will tell you the plan. You meet me at the fake Taj Mahal, the day after tomorrow. We will get married and elope. No one will come to know a thing! have you understood? - Yes. Okay. Now, you should leave. Actually... This... What is this? - A catalogue for groom's clothing. Tell me, what should I wear when I come to you? Wear this one. You will look good. This one? - Yes. I was thinking of red. - Hey, I will wear red, Sintu. You better get out before papa comes here and bashes you up. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Let me see if the coast is clear? Yeah, there is no one. Get out quickly. Hurry up! Sintu Bhaiya! Oh, there you are! I was looking for you in the godown to drink beer. And you are here? So, how are things? Don't ask me how I am? I am in a bad mood? What happened? Hey, it's just that... I need money. I am thinking of selling the car. What are you saying, brother? Don't talk like that. Tell me. I'll give up my life for you. Don't talk nonsense. How much do you need? You make me pay for your cold drinks, and are asking me how much do I want? Hey, even if I cannot give, I can arrange it for you. I hope you trust me. How much do you need? Tell me? Fifty thousand. Fifty thousand? That's all? You will get fifty thousand like this. Come along. Where from? We will thrust our hands in a hole and get the money out. Come, Sintu Bhaiya. I'll show you heaven. Not everyone can enter this place. Come, come, come. Come inside. [Indistinct chatter] Listen, you must keep two things in mind. Hey, fatso! Hey, fatso! Dance properly! Dance! What? Come down. [Indistinct chatter] What's going on? - Nothing, it is the recovery process. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, they are all defaulters. You are not a defaulter. You will return the money once you are married. Come. The scoundrels are over reacting. It doesn't hurt that much! I have the experience. You ignore all this. Hey, where is brother? In the bathing room. Hey, where is brother? [Indistinct chatter] Come on. be quick. Brother. Hello, brother. Yeah. - How are you, brother? Fine, fine. Hello. Hello, brother. Hey, will you make me sin? No, no, brother. Don't you recognise him? Mr. Pinte Bhaiya from the main market? - Yeah? This is his son. Hey, who doesn't know, Pinte Bhaiya? Dance! Dance! Want a drink? Brother, at this hour? Hey, I am offering tea. Hey, no, brother. This is a bit urgent. He needs fifty thousand rupees. Okay, give it to him. And explain all the rules to him. Everything is clear to him, brother. - Okay, then. He is getting married next week. He will return it the day after he gets married. So you are getting married? Huh? Yes, brother. I deserve it. Fine. - Yes, brother. Thank you. Come on. - Hey, listen. Yes, brother? Won't you invite me for the wedding? Brother, how will the wedding take place, if you don't come? It is on Wednesday, next week. Please, come. His wife seems to be marrying multiple times on Wednesday! What is this? Brother, they are getting cosy. My days are about to come. - Oh, yeah? Brother, should I get cold drinks? Your sister-in-law is about to come. We will drink with her. Okay. - Okay, listen. When your sister-in-law comes, get one cold drink with two straws. Done, brother. - Brother, sister-in-law is here. Can you sit someplace else? I have to discuss something important. Do I have to tell you again? I was here to enquire about the wedding arrangements. What can I say? Ah, don't order anything. I am in a hurry. I have no time. Actually... Hi. - This is... What is this? - I got you a gift. I told you... After the wedding... Dear, you are so sweet! But listen, the wedding is tomorrow. Give it to me then. I wear it for you tomorrow. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. "Come sweetheart, let me show you the stars..." "Let me take you where the heart begins to dance." Sister-in-law left. Should I take out one straw? Both of you can drink it. Hey! Ah, huh! Where are you going in all your finery? I am going to get your daughter-in-law home. What a sense of humour! Will you take me with the wedding procession or not? I have goosebumps all over my body! I know, it's you. Now, list my head gear, so that I can see your face. Lift it! Lift it! Who are you, brother? Oh, dear! Oh, hell! Yeah, so? When will you return my money? Brother, I swear on my father. I will return every penny. Please, let us go, brother. Yes. Yes, brother. Look at their faces? They look like footwear! And dreams! Low status! Right said, brother. - Shut up! Please, come. Please, come. - Hello, brother. You are making Pinte Bhaiya proud. He apparently, is the most deserving. You are right, brother. Correct. Look, the girl has eloped. - What? And I must recover my money. Make them sit. Hey, sit down! - Call their fathers. No. Please, let us go. Make him sit in my car. Come on. - No. Brother, you can take EMI's. Brother! God knows who has eloped with my innocent daughter? May vermin attack him! Hey, stop it, now. Why are you crying so much? I have registered a police complaint. The girl will come back. I have no faith in your police. You go. Go to the priest from Mathura. He will tell us, in which direction has she gone. And then bring her back. That's it. I don't trust the police. The police won't do anything. - That bl**dy priest! get up! Get up! - Hey, what are you doing? Hey, wait! - Quiet! Priest! Priest! Priest! - Hey, wait! The priest said this! The priest said that! She will make the family proud! So, now, she has! I will hit you with the broom! - No. Why are you losing your temper, Mr. Gupta? The large one is for Sintu Bhaiya. The rest are for the others. Take this, brother. I am leaving. Are you going to your dad's wedding in that fancy dress? Why are you in such a hurry? Don't talk about my father! I am going to meet my girlfriend. Got it? Something you don't have. Losers! Everyone is humiliating us, brother. I swear, brother, none of us will look at girls after today. Enough is enough, brother. Hereafter, all of us will focus on our respective work and jobs. This story will end where it began. Do you have a pen? 'Sonam Gupta is a Deceiver.' Right said, brother? She has betrayed you. Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! Sonam Gupta! - Is a deceiver! 'In the encyclopaedia of the Internet, that is on Google,' 'there have been more than a lakh searches on Sonam Gupta.' 'There have been a thousand Tweets...' 'Despite all that, Sonam has not come out in the open.' 'Brothers and sisters,' 'I have come to know that Sonam Gupta is a deceiver!' "You have deserted my heart..." "Why do I still think of you?" "You have other dreams..." "Why did you shatter my hopes?" "At least destroy me completely." "What is the point in living like that?" "How do I forget you, my love?" "How do I forget you, my love?" "Every breath I take, has your name on it." "Every breath I take, has your name on it." "What is left of my heart?" "I have nothing to call my own, It's all yours." "I will forget about you." "You do as you please." "I have no place to call my own." "My destination is very far!" "Though you have broken my heart," "You won't be able to go too far." "You will think of me every evening." "You will think of me every evening..." "My heart is sure of that." "My heart is sure of that." 'Hello, everyone.' 'I am Sonam Gupta.' 'People are maligning me on Social media these days.' 'People are spreading rumours about me.' 'Rahul, please stop all this.' 'Your Sonam is not a deceiver.' - Where did he go? I don't know. 'How are you?' 'How was your journey?' - 'Perfect.' - Hey. 'It was good.' - Manohar. Hey, no, dear. Don't bother. Hey, come, come, come. - [Indistinct chatter], Hello. - Come. Hello, brother-in-law. - Bless you. Move aside, let me touch his feet. Hey, you spoke to me on the phone yesterday. You didn't tell me? We thought of giving you a surprise. - Hey! Come, come in. 'The Sealdah Express stopped at every village. So, it got late.' 'Because it was late, we reached at 2 PM.' Mom! Mom, wake up. Sanjana auntie and uncle have come. 'Where is sister-in-law?' - Sintu! Hey, wake up. Auntie and uncle are here. We have bought Chunnilal's sweets. She is on a diet. What? - Yes. Give it to mother. She will be delighted. 'Come, sit.' - 'Yeah.' Hello, mother. [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] How are you? I am fine. I am fine. Sanjana? You haven't changed a bit. You seem to have become younger? You are also becoming youthful. They have brought sweets from Chunnilal, for you. Hello, auntie. - There... Hello, son. How are you, prince? - How are you? Tanu! - Hmm? - Sit, sit. Take this sandwich for Sintu. Sister, if you ask me, you should get Sintu married. Hmm. - Now, look, Manoj is younger, but he is getting hitched. It doesn't look good. So, get me a good proposal. A girl who is educated like our Sintu and is pretty? Do you know, he has rejected more than two hundred girls. Sister, there is a proposal. We are going to their place to invite them. You come along with us. You can see the girl under that pretext. Yes, so tell me. We will talk. Sister, there is a little hassle though. - What? The girl divorced her husband after a few months of marriage. What nonsense are you talking? Is your mind in the right place? Is my Sintu, a cripple, handicapped or deaf, that he will marry such a girl? Look at what she is saying! - Calm down, mom. What do you mean calm down? I have heard the girl is beautiful. - What are you saying? The boy is very fortunate. There... Sintu Bhaiya is here. Come, join us, brother. How are you all? - Come, come. All good. - What happened, brother? You look disturbed? No, no, I am not worried. - Hey, get a cold drink for brother. I have heard, Sintu Bhaiya is opening a showroom? Yes, Sintu Bhaiya, your showroom should be, like Shekhar's, like a huge mall. Mine will be better that that. And brother, employ girls instead of salesmen. Then watch how the things sell like hotcakes! Look at him. He is coming here with his wedding card. Are you getting married? Have you ever looked at your face? Don't laugh! You also read it. Your faces will also look like mine. What is it? Let me see. Gagan Gupta weds Sonam Gupta. Yes, Gagan Gupta with Sonam Gupta. So, your face also looks like mine? Scoundrels! Get lost! Hey, Sintu Bhaiya, whether or not you succeed in love, the entire country knows about your betrayal. In fact, I have heard PM Modi had decided to stop printing five hundred and thousand rupee notes. Hey, stop your nonsense! Now, I will get married on this day or it will be my funeral. Hey! Sintu Bhaiya! What is it, Sintu Bhaiya? Did I not say? Begin with the arrangements. Why are you getting serious? Sintu Bhaiya? Though he was not in the film, he wrote the entire script. He was not Srikant Verma. He is the same Srikant? Just tell me whether I should write or not? Mr. Tiwari... - I hope we don't forget anyone. Auntie. I am willing to marry the girl despite her problems. Tomorrow, I will come along with you to see the girl. Sintu? Mom, you organise the clothes. I will arrange the car. Sintu. Sintu. What's wrong with him? I didn't say anything. Sister is upset with me for no reason. Hello. Please, come. Hello, how are you? Take a look. Tell me how you like it? Oh, wow! I am sure this is your choice. This is my elder daughter, Sonam. Hello. - Please, have tea. Have your tea, please. Have something, son. Is Sonam your nickname? Look, our Sintu likes Sonam. The children seem to like each other. Now, the elders must decide what to do next. Look, as far as we are concerned, you are coming to Manoj's wedding. Let's organise the 'Roka' ceremony then. This sounds good. - Yeah? Okay, let's make a move. - Let's go. Let's go then. [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] Yes, sir. - Hello, uncle. What, have we printed the wrong address? I don't think it's possible. Anyway, you... Okay, tell me the correct address. Yeah. I'll do it, uncle. I will call you back. Hey, son. Just... - Hello, uncle. God bless you. - Yeah. This is a bit urgent. Do you understand? - Tell me? Here... The boy's name should be here. This is the boy's name. Please, note it down. Son, I just changed this, the rest of the material will remain as it is. Oh, uncle. You are getting the name changed for the third time! Hey, what can I do, buddy? How do I explain this to you? I simply can't! This is the last time. After this I will tear the card! Why will you tear the card, put my name on it. Rahul! Speak less. Okay? Stay quiet. Don't talk like a fool. What do you mean By, put my name? Why are you getting upset, uncle? I said that because, no one wants to marry girls with the name Sonam Gupta. Is it? - Yes. Yeah? - Hey, boy. Take this. What rubbish! Give it to him. - Brother! Brother? - Yes, buddy? Where is Pinte Bhaiya's house? Brother, it is the third house on this street. Take a left from the next alley. Anyway, sir. Should I tell you something? One is Pinte Bhaiya's son and the other is your daughter, these are the two people in this city no one wants to marry. When will I get the card? When should I come? Not before Monday. - Get it done. Give it on Monday. Yes, pick it up on Monday. - Okay? I will make your payment. Don't worry. - Sure. And listen, forget about the world, and worry about yourself. Sister, I hope you are happy with this alliance? No, no. Nothing of the sort. I tell you, she is a good girl. Yes, whatever God wills, is bound to happen. Sister. - They are here. I showed them around. - Please, come, sister. Come, auntie. Please, sit. - Sit. Get some tea, dear. No, Tanu, dear. Sonam's father and uncle must be on their way back from the shop, then we can all have tea together. Till then, I wanted to talk to Sintu. Hey, sister. The showroom is lying vacant. Ask brother-in-law to initiate the work quickly. No, son. Please sit down. -[Indistinct chatter] Sit. Papa. - Yeah? What is it? You look worried? No, no, I am not worried. And if at all I worry a bit, then I am, after all, a father. I hope you are not hiding anything from me? Nothing? What will I hide? - Sure? I just want to get it done with Sintu's showroom... I will manage everything. Papa, you love all of us a lot, huh? 'What is common between the Sun and a wife?' 'What?' 'You cannot stare at either of them!' 'Hey, what is the matter? You don't call or message?' 'Have you forgotten me?' - Hmm? This is the last cheque for Prakash. 'Tell me.' - 'I don't miss you at all!' I had given him three lakh rupees? - This is the last one. How are you Pinte Bhaiya. - Yes, I am fine. Naved Bhaiya? Hey, Pinte Bhaiya? - Hello. Hey, get another plate! - No, no, no, no. You carry on. Please, eat. - Hey, why? You have, please. I am full. Hmm. - Hey, Naved Bhaiya. I had spoken to you about... The showroom I am building for my son... I am running short of money for that. I wanted... I mean, all I need is three lakh rupees. If you can lend it to me? Pinte Bhaiya. I thought you had come here to pay back something. Look, please don't joke at meal time. I am not joking. Naved Bhaiya. - Hmm? Business is not good. You know that. And I am not a big businessman like you. And then, the value of my shop is pretty good. You have all the papers. And I will pay you back before Sintu's wedding. Munna. Yes, brother? Call Pinte Bhaiya at our office tomorrow. Okay? Huh? - Okay. Put some more. Mushtaq, pull it up. Where is uncle? - He is inside. Why is uncle sulking now? Hey, please, take your stuff.

But my turmeric ceremony is a bit grand. "Let's play the drums, apply henna..." "The bride is..." He is my elder brother's son. - Hello. And she is his fiancé. he has come from America. - Hello, uncle. You? Hey, Sintu? You? How are you? Have some sweets. Meet him. He is Harsh, my fiancé. Hello. And you are? He was the boyfriend. - Sorry? My best friend's... Oh, okay. - Sonam... Nice to meet you. - Come soon. "The sister-in-law is amazing." "The sister teases her brother..." "The anklets tinkle..." Brother, brother. Listen. Can you pour some water into it? I want to wash my hands. It is empty. I want to talk to you. But, I have no wish to speak to you. Move. Move aside. Why is this happening to me? God, I am very upset with you. I had not even gotten her properly yet. And now I have to face her again. Check! Check! Check! 'The star of all wedding processions in Moradabad,' 'Band Shaktiman.' Sister, look. What is he wearing? Hey, whatever he is wearing is fine. You go and change. This is a bit too much. Should I take it off? - Why? - 'Hello, hello!' Hey! Sanjana! Really? - 'Do you plan to come down today?' Look, he started shouting! 'A new presentation!' 'So, gear up for the entertainment.' 'Shatina! Shatina!' I want to talk to you. I don't want to talk to you. Let go of my hand. But I want to talk. Okay, fine. tell me? Did you not feel any pity on me? Why did you betray me, tell me? What is all this? Who is he? You had eloped with that Gagan Gupta? After that, I eloped with two other boys. Don't you know about that? And what is it to you? Nothing. Just tell me, what was lacking in me? Why didn't you marry me? You turned me into a laughing stock in Bareilly. And you made me famous by writing, Sonam Gupta is a deceiver on currency notes? Be happy, Sintu. That I did not say anything to you, because I don't care! Do you know the pain it caused my father? You better stay away from all this. Just do your work. Understood? Sonam. Please, answer the question I asked you. Otherwise, I will go and tell him, that I was not your friend's boyfriend, I was your boyfriend. Are you threatening me, Sintu? I am not threatening. I will really do it. Go, and tell him. - I am not kidding. I will go an tell him. - Don't irritate me. Leave my hand, Sintu. Just tell me, why did you desert me? Do you want to know why did I betray you? - Yes. I left you because you have a small one! Got it? And, now, I will go and tell the world, that the Sintu who wants everything, large, has a small one! What is it, you would say? Yes. Sintu Bhaiya, means large! Now, see how I clip your wings. "I'll explode a bomb in your heart..." "I'll explode a bomb in your heart..." "You turned out to be a scoundrel, my love." "I am not sure why you hurt me so much?" "You are responsible for the hurt on my face." "My love fell short." "My love fell short." "You turned out to be a scoundrel, my love." "I'll explode a bomb in your heart..." "You turned out to be a scoundrel, my love." Hey, look at that. The garland is coming on a helicopter! Hey, take a picture, buddy. Smile a bit. - Let it be. It's enough. Come on. - Okay, let's go. Hey, Sintu. Mr. Sintu, you have hidden talents? You are getting married? Hey, photographer. Take a picture. Yeah. Hey, what happened? - Actually... I don't like garlands. - Is it? I love them. Look son, wedding is a social convention. A man gets married, makes a family... And that is how the wheel of life moves forward. You know, my daughter went through a divorce once. We have passed through a painful period, son. I did not quite get you? Look, son, to be able to make a family, it is important to be physically healthy. Now, that... The person Sonam was married to earlier, he was impotent. So, I wanted that, once before the wedding, let us get your full body check-up done. When marriages break, there is a lot of muck, son. Now, you are a modern boy, please, don't mind. But it is the duty of the bride's father to have this conversation. Yes, of course. I am fine. I don't have any such problem. Thank you, son. 'Sonam was chasing her dreams, oblivious of the world around her.' 'Put a sort of break in Sintu's life.' 'A big house and a grand shop on the one hand,' 'and all the wedding arrangements...' 'And on the other hand,' 'there was a fresh storm in Sintu Bhaiya's life.' You had never imagined... You had never imagined... People associate Sintu with the word large. And I have a small one! I cannot even die, God! Did you say something, brother? I want to die. Then die! 'My father would say, to keep an open mind,' 'is as important as keeping a safe closed.' 'Now, receiving information with a closed mind,' 'and Sintu Bhaiya's condition...' 'See for yourself!' Hey, Sintu, it is your turn. The rascal took the newspaper. 'Sukh Shanti Clinic' Poor, Sintu. - Hey! What happened? Nothing. Let's go. - Let's go. Yes. Oh, let it be! The guy I sent to Canada, you said you will get him a good job? You are making him do menial work? You are making the guy I sent to Dubai, pluck dates? Don't you have any other work apart from brooming and dates? Disconnect the call! I get such embarrassing phone calls. - Hello, uncle. Hello, son. - How are you? How is Mr. Chawla? All good? He is fine. He is good. - Great. Uncle, now, you have some sweets. Why, buddy? - This is my fiancé. I am engaged now. - Wow! Wow! Wow! Congratulations! Congratulations! And uncle, this is her file. Oh, you want to apply for a visa? - Yes, uncle. Where? - U.S. Okay, America. - Yes. Is your name, Sonam Gupta? Yes. Not the one mentioned on currency notes? What do you mean by currency notes? Hey, whenever I hear this name, I remember this incident about currency notes. One minute. Wait a minute. - Sure. I also have a few of these notes. Here, take a look. Yeah. And ever since I have got these, my safe has been full of money. 'Sonam Gupta is a Deceiver.' It is just a joke, buddy. Dear, I will get your work done. Okay. Don't be tense. Stay stress free.

I guarantee success. The medicine costs only rupees two hundred. Try it, brother. If it doesn't work, I will return the money. I told you, I don't want it. One tablet in the morning and one i the evening... Brother, where will I find him? Hey, he is my uncle. He lives close by. Hey, don't go. He will cheat you. He has cheated a lot of people. Hey, this is the right clinic. Guaranteed effect in a week or else take your money back. Come inside. - No, I will go to him. Hey, what happened? Hey, are you upset? Take this. You will have children. Go to that window, deposit rupees five hundred and take medicine. Hello. - Young man, what is your problem? Actually, I saw your advertisement. Yes? What are you looking at? I am examining at your illness. Actually, your plant is not growing. But, don't worry. I will give you a compost that will show effect in three days. But, you will have to do something. Get a receipt for rupees five thousand from that window. But the advertisement mentioned two hundred? Yes, buddy. But yours is small, so the fees will be huge? Yes. 'Take the medicine from here.' Mix it in oil and apply it twice a day. And eat this. Hey, who spilled oil in the bathroom? I would have slipped. I don't know. Does he have a clue about what happens in the house? Very good. - I want that. Hey, do you remember Mrs. D'Souza? From college? - How can anyone forget her? Do you remember Ravi from college? Dude, I met him yesterday. He has not changed one bit. How are you? - I am good, thank you. You look absolutely, stunning. Thanks. I think, it's time to tell them? - Okay. Yeah? Guys! Guys, listen in. Okay, so, I have a little bit of a surprise for you all. I would like you all to meet my beautiful fiancé, Sonam Gupta. Wow! - Wow! I hope she is not the Deceiver Sonam? Sorry, what? Let me take a selfie with Sonam Gupta. Thank you. No. What was that? - I have no idea. Are you sure you have an idea. Why would someone make a random statement like this? How would I know, harsh? Why are you spoiling your mood? It is my engagement announcement. And someone has just said something? Why are you getting bothered? Come on, let's enjoy the party. Of course, I am bothered. No, this is not cool. - Party? Where are you going? Harsh? - I... I am done. Harsh. Harsh, what happened? Why did you walk out of the party like that? What is this Deceiver Sonam? I... They were joking. It's okay. Well... That was really embarrassing. Embarrassing? Harsh, you should be happy that your wife to be is so popular. Come on. Okay, tell me something. What if I really am that Sonam? Listen, I don't like such kind of jokes. Just change your name. What? I am not joking. I am dead serious. Harsh. Stop the car. Harsh. I said, stop the car. Harsh. I said, stop the car! Wh... What? Sonam! 'Love may be a ladder towards dreams,' 'but not resolve.' 'The Sonam who accepted herself,' 'maybe a deceiver in the eyes of the world...' 'But she has never deceived herself!' Sintu. These outfits have come from your in-law's. Take a look, at least. They have sent such a bad colour for us... I will never wear it. Okay, listen. Your father-in-law has called multiple times. Why don't you call him back? I'll call him. So, call him. It doesn't look good. 'Come inside, only if you have faith.' Come, come, brother. Come inside. Take a seat. Sit down. There is no need to be afraid. I had warned you earlier. But you did not listen to me. Anyway, now, you have come to the right place. Sit, don't worry. I will call my father. Will I get treated in this tiny clinic? Greetings, sir. - Hello. Yes, so, tell me. What is your problem? Tell me. - Actually... I have a small one. [laughing] - Is it funny? My life has gone upside down and you are laughing? Oh, relax. First, you, drink this water. Are you married? No. But I am about to get married. Oh, I see. So, sir you have the illness, that most Indian men have. Sorry? I didn't get you? - I'll explain it to you. Actually, this is not an illness. It is just in your mind. Have you ever fallen in love? Doctor, what are you saying? Is that how you treat people? I don't want your treatment. - Hey! Hey, sir. Relax. Sit down. Sit. You are very short-tempered. What did you say your name is? - Sintu. Mr. Sintu. First, give your heart to someone. Then love with all your heart. That's it. I am sure you don't have any illness. Is that true? - Yes. Hey, sir. Not me but, my forty years of experience is talking. You go and get a full body check-up. And after that, if you still have a problem, come and see me then. I will treat you. You, really are a very good doctor. You have given me confidence. Thank you, doctor. - Hey, young man, everything is about faith. If a person has faith in oneself, then this small clinic, gives your the experience of a hospital. I understood. What is your consulting fee? Fees? When I did not treat you, why should I take any money? You are amazing, doctor. Go. Stay happy. - Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much. - You have no problem at all. God bless you. The young crowd today... Yes, tell me? - I am Mr. Gupta. I am a cashier at the Bareilly branch. I am here to load the ATM. We are Sonam's parents, dear.

'Hey, let it be...' Greetings, madam. Hello. So, son? What's up? Pinte Bhaiya, can you step aside for two minutes? I am glad you have come. Please have your dinner. - Yes, I will eat before I leave. All of you must eat before you leave. Yes, sure. I am glad they have also come. Pinte Bhaiya, I have a lot of respect for you in my heart. Okay, just tell me one thing? Look at his face. Does it say stupid? No? Look at his face. Does it say stupid? Naved Bhaiya. - No, have I ever... Listen to me? - I... Have I ever said anything? Have I ever said anything? No! I am helpless. - But each time you said, After the house... After the shop... Okay. Congratulations on your son's wedding. Naved Bhaiya. - I like jokes, too. But I don't joke around. But should I do it today? Listen to me. I will... I am under a lot of stress. I am telling you. I will manage everything. Yeah, I understood. - Come on. Brother-in-law. - Hey, where are you taking him? Brother? - Brother-in-law? - Papa? Hey, wait! Hey! Hey, Tanu look after your grandmother. You look after the guests. Hey! Hey! - Stop them! Sintu! Sintu! Sintu! - Sister, where have they taken him? Sintu, where have they taken your father? Huh? I know where they have taken him. - Where? Uncle, take out the car. - Hurry up! Let's go. Let's go. Who were these people? Someone tell me? Hey, I am feeling very scared. They just took him away. He could not even finish his meal. I have never seen them before. Has he ever mentioned anything to you? You please, look after yourself. Look, brother. There is a wedding at my house. I beg you. Our relatives are here. It is embarrassing. Please, let him go. Look, we will bring your money by morning. Yes, just give us four days. Please. We have seen a happy day after a lot of struggle. We will return your money after my Sintu gets married. I give you my word. Sister-in-law, Pinte Bhaiya is like an elder brother to me. Look, he is sitting like a guest, inside. Take your time. I have no problem. He is in his own house. I will send him to you with two to three kilos extra... You stay quiet! Stay quiet. - No, that is fine. But... - Enough! The wedding? Let's go. Come. Sintu. Listen. Do something. - Hey, I am trying. Listen, listen. - People will look down on our family. One minute, let me make a call. I am responsible for all this. - Hello. Hello. Today, he is in this condition because of me. - Hello. [Crying] Now, how will I face everyone? Mom, where is papa? Where is papa, Sintu? He is inside. - What happened, brother? Mom, may I talk? - No, no, no. There is no need to talk. What? Have you arranged for something? None of the numbers are working. - Try to call someone!! Hey, who will pick my call in the middle of the night? It's okay, brother. We are all here. Hey, do something! Brother! Who are you? Sonam Gupta. I have understood the difference between a rumour and truth, after meeting you today. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Pinte Bhaiya. Hey, Sonam. Why are you doing all this for me? Because, if one of my dreams shatter, but it saves someone's family prestige, it is fine by me. It is very easy to call someone a deceiver, but to understand a person, is equally hard! But you won't understand. Because, your horizon is very limited. Understood? Auntie, if after all this, your son changes for the better, then assume my betrayal had more power than your maternal love. "Don't think of where I was." "Let me be reborn." "Let me be free." Papa, you let it be. - Hey? I am doing it. You sit down. Be careful. Careful. Papa. - Yeah? I will open the shop from today. You come at leisure. 'Now, I have understood perfectly…' 'That why did Sonam leave Sintu?' 'Had she not been a deceiver,' 'then it would have been hard to understand,' 'that there is no harm is dreaming big.' 'Yes, but there is way to fulfil your dreams.' 'A big house. A grand shop...' 'And more than a big car, what is more important is,' 'to have a broad mindset.' "Let me be free..." "Let me be free..." "From every disaster..." "From all the light..." "From the burning torches in a procession..." "From the reality... From all the miracles..." "From all the questions..." "Free me..." "Let me be free..." "Let me be free..." Sintu? You? I came here to return your dreams. I don't want it back, Sintu. I could not even thank you for the other day. I have come home to my family, because of you. In fact, I have grown up. I could not make you fall in love with me. But, I have adopted your dreams. Please, don't refuse. Please, keep it. And live your dreams. Sintu. Sintu, I have never been able to do justice to any relationship. But I would like to do justice to my friendship with you. Sonam. Look, don't stop me. I better leave. "Neither will you order me..." "Nor should you expect anything from me..." "Release me from the pressure of having to forgive you." "From the reality... From all the miracles..." "From all the questions..." "Free me..." "Let me be free..." "Free me..." "Let me be free..." "Free me..." "Let me be free..." "Don't think of where I was." "Let me be reborn." "Let me be free..." "Let me be free..." "Let me be free..." "Let me be free..." "Let's go for a fiesta." "Let's go for a fiesta." "Let's go for a fiesta." "Let's go for a fiesta." "All by yourself..." "Let's go for a fiesta." "All by yourself? "Where are you off to?" "Your kohl is so lucky, and so are your high heels." "Your yellow dress is luckier, at least it can feel you." "Your kohl is so lucky, and so are your high heels." "Your yellow dress is luckier, at least it can feel you." "I am done for, a crazy Romeo is after my life!" "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "A magician has come from another world." "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "A magician has come from another world." "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "Let's go for a fiesta." "All by yourself? "Where are you off to?" "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "All by yourself?" "I am done for!" "I love you..." "I am alive because I love you." "I am alive because I love you." "Do me a favour, love." "Take my life." "Do me a favour, love." "Take my life." "Now that our eyes have met... We are in love." "We are in love." "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "A magician has come from another world." "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "A magician has come from another world." "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "A magician has come from another world." "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "With first love and dreams in his eyes..." "All by yourself?" "All by yourself? "All by yourself? "All by yourself? "I am done for!"
