Actually, that was my brother (Leslie) we feel so proud of it Yes, indeed, you are still very young to have such wealth My true passion, you know, is the things that are hidden in the world, all that is hard to come by Some say I like putting together things but there's one thing I'm really obsessed with It's the famous crown of fire and red diamonds Is this... is this some kind of prank software? So imagine my surprise when I stumbled across your book... in the midst of all these sexual feelings On something really cool I understand, I understand now Oh my God, I really thought you two kidnapped me I mean, this is the kind of marketing that Beth planned, right? This is really cool guys, this is amazing You, with that gun and mustache, and your majestic figure Oh my God, oh my God, with your GI-Joe look and your clothes The archaeologist in the novel was translating an extinct language Something no one could do In fact, no one has ever tried to write something like this before, have they?

Here we are now What is that? I think it accurately describes the location of Claman's tomb. Where the invaluable crown of the Queen (Taha) is buried Even if these are actually events you have to find out The location of a whole hidden city that no one has found before Already found it on an unknown island in the Atlantic Ocean But what I couldn't really find was Claman's tomb. And this manuscript is the only thing that can lead us to it I need someone who can decipher these codes Of course, you don't want the story to end like this We've all lost our dreams or, in my case, pandered to my little brother But this is our chance to prove it to them Come with me to the island and help me translate these symbols and help me find the Crown of Fire You can order any amount you want I have to politely decline Well, I can't say you didn't disappoint me, but I understand how you feel Will you allow us to deliver you? No thanks, I will order my own car and I will I don't think you're listening... to me, this is an emergency and we are Police say they have announced her disappearance in a flyer He kidnapped her by car and 24 hours passed and they did nothing What about the FBI and the CIA? I'm sure Loretta is fine In my college days, my girlfriend (Nikki) disappeared and everyone freaked out But she was only in her car It is true that she was dead but we found her, she did not disappear What if... we might have called a private investigator... or private security agencies or We want a rescue - Yes, who does things like this? - Veterans, right? - yes - I think I know someone who can help us I did a meditation session before And there was a coach, you really should see this guy He was a former trainer in the Special Operations Force What was his name? Yes, Jack Trainer. So is his name the same as his job? This is how I write names on my phone You see, Janice the mother, Larry the doorknob, Stacey the butt But that's what this guy does, he finds Missing people, if we want help, he is the right person I'm Jack Turner - His name is actually Jack Turner. Hi, I'm Alan from Touch Your Inner Self. Meditation session (Jack Trainer) Anyway, listen, our friend Loretta has been kidnapped and we need help How long has she been missing? Maybe 2 hours ago now who is she? - This is Beth. I'm Beth. Is her phone connected to wifi? She has her phone, right? - No, I have her phone. She has an electronic watch, it was the reason my wig fell out What happened then? It's okay, open her phone and go to the electronic clock app Then press the button: Find my electronic watch ...Oh my God, that's cool, and that's why we say "Encounter difficulties by finding easy solutions" Who said it? Oprah or Deepak Chopra? Laozi said it in his book Daodijing. Oh my God, it's in the Atlantic Ocean Is she on a plane? - How did you know that? - Because she can't swim that fast The target of the hijacker does not appear to be a ransom My guess is it's a bloody hunting mission, a coke-powered mission, a total mess We have to move fast How will we pay you? - Cryptocurrency via the application (cash) - If you find it 48 hours before, you will get a free rescue More than you can imagine I'll need her phone. - I'll get it for you. Send me the location where the plane landed and I'll meet you there Welcome where am I? You're on my plane, nice plane, aren't you? I'm getting off your plane, untie me It's the seat belt Do you drug me? Do people do such things? So we consider it a classic method I feel numbness all over my body - It's going to wear off now.

He says we don't respect his heritage, but there aren't many workers on the island, right, Ravi? 'Beggars have no freedom of choice' Yes, anything you want, just order Untie one hand, it has to translate some things so what? I really want you to try to realize the great opportunity that lies ahead I think this text will lead us to the exact location of the cemetery It's an alphabet based on symbols Like cuneiform or hieroglyphic writing So if you have other documents...I can compare them to them Yes, we found a lot of scratches next to the waterfalls and they were nothing but pictures of women Look, I'm like you, I wish your husband...the archaeologist was still alive to help us, but he's dead, so...

I was hoping to invite you to breakfast but it looks like you have work to do wait wait I think the manuscript refers to some burial So the translation is "(Kalaman) and his treasure" then the missing pieces and then the word: burial And there's something about "tears" too Where is that burial? ...nothing was mentioned about it, me Miss Sedge, I want to do better than that So next time don't kidnap a romance novel writer It can't be this difficult, we are going to build a building with an important purpose and impact for a great man King Claman was ambitious and powerful, he was the first to build a city in the Atlantic Ocean He was always under the watchful eye of his subjects He would have built a pyramid, a ziggurat, or a tower to put the crown of fire in it All I want is to know where it is I don't know if you remember or not but you asked me to translate it and I already translated it translate it again We'll laugh about this one day Something is destined to happen I have to come with you to help you because I'm cool But it's really great atmosphere Nature and wireless Yes, you are right, but it is very important for me that she knows that I came to save her Why?

You're the one who keeps doing it, I just hit one Seems wicked, it wasn't necessary Sorry, I just wanted to win once Excuse me, can you untie me from the chair? We don't have time - No time for that?

Just untie the rope - It works. Maybe next time you can hold the gun when I throw it at you And you, when you throw a gun, you have to tell me first, "Hold, Alan," and then you throw it at me. The phrase "here is" is synonymous with the word: hold No, it is not synonymous with it Yes, synonymous with it in the vernacular we say "Here is the jacket", we say "Here is the pen." No, the correct way is to say: Hold the thing Then I'll grab whatever you're throwing because you started the sentence with: Hold This is another way when you have a gun, that's all Watch out...we have to ask. We should call for help and go to the airport and get out of here, and I'll drive good Well, ask... ask for help where is your phone? My God They told me you caught her - We killed the blond. What do you think, Loretta? You may have killed one of them but her partner is still with her He is clearly skilled and trained at the highest level and very dangerous So Miss Sedge said she was leaving the party and then got in a car and left the party Have you tried to contact her? - She doesn't have her phone. So her phone was stolen? - I didn't say that. Where is my magnifying glass? Listen, can you help my grandmother? I don't want you to know what happened to Loretta, it will make her sad What happened to Loretta? - Nothing, Grandma. I went on a trip. Awesome? - Yes. She had to get out of the house Here's what happened, Loretta's phone wasn't stolen, I took it I gave it to Alan and he gave it to Trainer, Jack Trainer. So we found her watch And who is Alan? - (Dash) - And who is it? He's the hero of all her novels. O provocative grandmother Let's go to the next room and talk about the wars you've been through Come on, it's going to be fun, sorry, it's going to be fun Listen, Loretta Sedge is missing, and when I look up the location of a watch Her hand turns out to be taking a plane to an island I've never heard of This means that you have to do something about it, and if you don't Do something, I'll do it, and your attitude won't be nice I'm sure it's out of our jurisdiction, you should use the FBI good And if you talk to the detective, say a good word about me - and about me as well. about us What are you doing? Are you trying to reinstall the car? ...in fact, we can I said where is the phone? - In the cabin, in the cabin - My God We don't have a phone, and the car doesn't work Hold on - what is this? - jungle shoes Not a shoe for walking in the woods It occurred to me that your feet would hurt because of your shoes, I couldn't Something better than that, Allison shoes, sorry Well, thanks. - And I brought the cheese. Oh, my God. - You should drink water. I could only find plastic bottles so we have to get rid of them when we're done So what we have to do now is find a phone We call the authorities and then wait here for someone to come to our rescue We are already in the rescue operation, no one will come but me What? - I'm the savior - I would have come alone first and then (Trainer)... have mercy on his soul So our best option now is to get to the airport Do you see this way? We will take a shortcut from this area to the bush and then to the forest Short cut to the bush? - yes - Well, do you see us? - yes - You're not Dash and I'm not Lovemore, okay? We're Loretta and Alan, and the bush devours people like us I don't want to spoil my robe, it's a rental, so we'll stay here We're not going to stay here without doing anything, okay? So we'll go from the bush to the airport and find a phone so you can eat the cake you want And eat it too? - If that's what you want, no problem, let's go. It's the only thing that can be done with a cake I don't know what your people do with it, but my people eat it You can send it as a gift to someone Even if, eventually, they'll eat cake, everyone eats cake What would a small person do if he fell into it? He won't be able to eat it My God Why were you kidnapped? Is this some kind of weird sex like '96th Hour'? Oh, my God, thanks, I thought so too, but it turns out my kidnapper was a Fairfax family. Is it Beverly? - No, big brother - That moron has a vlog for Montezuma's treasure hunt. I saw it on the news, he was looking for the Titanic. Yes, he is looking for the Crown of Fire What? Hey, you mean the real fire crown... like the one in the remains of a city Yes, the lost city of D What? Are you kidding? This is exactly like your novel so we are on an adventure Realistic from the adventures of Lovemore and Dash, right? ...how - what is this? - won't find it Where will we go now? We have to go into the water What? - We have to swim in the water - No, I don't like water We have to go into the water I'm not asking you to live in it My body doesn't get along with water Does it agree with killing you? You're okay, I caught you, I caught you where are you going? - I'll cross the river - Don't stay in the water, I researched security strategies From the book "A Year in the Woods" They won't be able to track us in the water Why is the water warm? Are you urinating? Just swim away from the urine I guess... I think we ran from them, didn't we? Yeah, it wasn't bad, yeah ...good Don't panic What do you mean not to panic? - Don't panic - No, stop saying that There is something on your back No, what is this? - Stop screaming - What is that? Do you have one? No, I don't - Why don't you have one? - Maybe it's my non-stick cap, I don't know Take them off! I can't touch blood-sucking insects, try to take them off Quickly - You pick them up and take them off. You pick them up and take them off - Try to catch them. Try to... I don't like it I feel like I'm going to lose consciousness they suck my soul stop, stop stop that sound How many are they? - Not a large number - I feel like they suck on me they suck on my body oh my god oh my god Why do you say oh my god? Is it that bad? It can't be that bad, how many are there? It's not great They will suck every part of my body, help me Please stop talking, I need to take another look My God, they will suck up my body and only dry skin will be left of me You can't tell my dad I died this way, tell him I was I wrestle with an anaconda, or while I carry a sword or something similar I feel like a jumba and they suck every drop of me Why are they on my ass? It's like taking anchovies out of my Caesar salad, it's not too bad Why are you talking about food now? Let's just find the queen and get out of here I think you're fine now I want to check you from the front Well, I don't want to look Is it bad? Oh my gosh - what's up? just talk - I mean, when one has high expectations and gets excited about someone Everyone is excited - why are you excited? - What I mean is that people ask, they don't know, they don't know, right? They do not know until the moment comes when they know, and they know something they did not know before Are there parasites or not? Don't worry, your brave warrior is alone now Warriors of... What? - are you okay - It takes guts, why do they like butts like this? What are you singing? It's a song I used to hear when I was little It says if you try to take life from the island, the island will take your life Did your grandmother sing songs about the taking of life? I can't even translate the song very well What diseases may be transmitted by parasites? They don't eat eggs, do they? The Queen (Taha) "King (Kalaman) he and his treasure are buried." Buried in a well of endless tears What does "buried in the well of endless tears" mean? (Loretta) You're going to give me a heart attack where did you go? What is that? I'm not sure, maybe they meet here Can you imagine they were here? Exactly on our site The stories they were telling, I'm sure a lot of historical events happened here Looks like they're getting close to us. - We have to go up. Do you see what I'm wearing? Tight clothes with sequins Don't worry, we'll go up, come on, let's go I can't do that. I'm old. - No, you're beautiful. I didn't say I wasn't pretty, I said I was too old to do things like this All I do is sit and eat when I can't think Yes, you need better shoes than this You're the one who brought me these shoes, I can't go up with them I know you feel safe hanging on to the past, but you can move forward, okay? I can't, I can't Do you smell this scent? - what? - There is smoke What is the matter? Do they burn anything? Are they hunting of some kind? what do you think? Take a deep breath Yes like this Well done That was convenient, thank you - Yes, it was - ...I'll help you a little, one, two What are you doing? stop it Don't move. - This is my sensitive area. Just go upstairs, head up! You're doing well, keep going, keep going up Come on "Pleasure comes after hardship" What? Nothing, it's like Johnny and I used to say after we'd done something like.

What would happen if... I couldn't breathe Well, is everything all right? - I can not breathe - yes, ok My hands are out, our backs facing each other good cool, come on Come on, I want to hear the clap, let's clap for Loretta. You deserve it, old writer made you call About yourselves in the bush, well done, Loretta. Boss, people are dying now Don't you think we're exaggerating what we're doing? Is it worth it? I'm about to get something out of reach A rare thing, something that no nation or emperor could reach, not even flattering my brother would lead me to it Legendary Fire Crown So yeah, I'll say it's definitely worth it Excuse me Excuse me, sir, my flight will resume There is no flight, the pilot is sick, come tomorrow No, no, sir, I can't come tomorrow. I want the trip today to Handeda Island. Tonight, some people's lives are in danger. - Come tomorrow. Excuse me, miss. - Yes. I couldn't help myself from snooping over you and overheard you talking about steak Well, what I'm going to say is crazy but I love steaks too What? I also like steaks...you might like... I don't know, maybe No, it's a similar word, I meant their lives are in danger, I have to get to the island tonight Well, I think I can help you, I have a cargo plane Maybe I can drop you off to the island after the goods are delivered I'm going to ask you something but you have to answer me honestly Have you ever killed someone before? no no I don't believe you, but I will tell you something, if you think for a moment about killing me, I promise I will kill you first. It would be my pleasure - You weirdo, let's go - The treasure of King (Kalaman) is buried in the well of endless tears What is that? ...it's...it's...it's something It's not what you think Isn't this a piece of the old Fairfax manuscript? Well, maybe it's what you think I thought you were smarter than that, Loretta, Fairfax will never stop chasing us What did you think? There is a volcano that can bury the cemetery before we reach it, before we see it, before we preserve its memory. Excuse me, is that what we do? Because nobody told me, when were you gonna tell me? Why did I tell you that? We're in it together now, I came to save you You know you're not Dash, right? You don't ride a white horse and save people You spray yourself bronze and stand in front of the machines that extract the air and it's all great for you How do you know the truth about my personality? I know you well, you're an obvious person, Alan. Well, then who am I? I feel... well I was a handsome boy who was popular in college stadiums And when you found yourself in an unknown place with no hope of becoming a star, you came to Los Angeles. Then one day a woman appeared who could not publish her book on colonialism The Spaniard in the Atlantic decided to write a romance novel She randomly chose you to be the cover model And fortunately for you and her luck, the novel became widely known She continued with her trivial writings, and you continued with the photo sessions And as you know, none of us became what we wished to be in the end Until one day we died in the bush On one of the Atlantic islands you wrote about years ago, right? Subtransl.ed balloumowgly It's called Sarasota, by the way, and it's not an unknown place Where I lived with my mother and two sisters And yes, I started my modeling career to get away from there The only job I could think of was to go to all the places I dreamed of going Then finally to Los Angeles, where I was modeling the cover of your romance novel I was so embarrassed when one of my friends saw me with a wig on your cover that I stopped talking to them for months There was a woman running up to me and she's so happy and saying "Dash" I thought, How can I be ashamed of something that makes people so happy? Do whatever you want, Loretta. But don't underestimate the fans of your work and describe it with trivial writings This is not fair to them do you know? It's ironic to think that you're the only one who wouldn't judge a book by its cover You mean judge a book by the viewer's cover? (right Now) (right Now) There are two of them I'm here, Loretta. - Alan. Motorcycles and pistols Motorcycles and pistols Let's go from this direction Don't shoot Just give them the manuscript. - I can't. Yes you can, just say “here it is” and throw it at them I'll make sure they let us go How do they find us? Because of your disco ball gown. We have to think of a trick. - I have an idea. We dig a hole and then make a sound and say "come here" or you can imitate the sound of a bird No, I have a plan - Please, Alan, let me think. ...please just let me think of me Hey, they were shooting at you - Yeah, so we're hiding. They didn't shoot me they need my wits What? I don't think you hear what you're saying I will protect you as a shield. - I will protect you. Why? Because I'm a woman? This is sexist Using women as shields wasn't really the change she was seeking (Gloria Seinfeld) Do you mean Gloria Steinem? - whatever - Tell me about sexism from a men's point of view Oh my God, I'm a woman, I can't talk about anything from a men's point of view I belong to the feminist movement and so I believe that a woman can do anything that men can do We should stay here until they get tired of chasing us Why don't you just listen to my plan? We're in a lot more trouble than just loving you to take off your shirts I'm not sure about that three yes It wasn't really what I had planned ...I just wanted to stop I think the wind caused that I think we're the reason, we're the ones who did it, we only dealt with one guy I think we just wanted to stop him but the other guy didn't move So... he is to blame Even if we weren't here, that would have happened Why didn't he stop before the slope? But they were wearing...helmets, so maybe But the rest of their bodies don't wear helmets, they only wear them on their heads They were driving recklessly, right? No harsh handling of bicycles It is forbidden to do bad things on bicycles Maybe they are fine Yes, maybe no, it's okay ...it's okay, you know, things happen like this, let's go You can't bring back the torn pieces it's rented What more can I do? You've done a lot so far, Beth. My poor beloved grandmother has lost her sight The release of the book was disastrous and I invested all my money in it so I am completely broke now Most of all, I lost a writer. Who would allow such a thing to happen? You remind me of my girlfriend Randy, Beth. She always takes care of others and never takes care of herself Isn't that right, Randy? She's like this little psychotherapist I laugh so hard at that ...after you're done with your girlfriend's order What do you think of going to a beach? What? - I have something to do in Hawaii. It is not necessary for her to come with us Well, well, you can come with us, it's so funny Let me ask you something, we're sitting here talking, who's flying the plane? Autopilot - what? - Go to the cockpit and drive the plane good It's time to go down... No, no, take the goat please take the goat That Englishman kidnapped her Hi, I'm Beth, leave a message and I'll call you back hello beth listen I'm sorry I spoiled the book tour I was scared and... selfish Well, Alan came, I'll call you back Police Department The police will look for Fairfax and protect us while we're here Did they say anything about our time here? They'll try to book a plane for us tonight, and until then we can clean ourselves up and change our clothes good good Come on Dance with your husband not my husband It's okay. - No, let's dance. No, no, she doesn't like it, the shoes she doesn't have In fact, that's the only thing that fits with these shoes You don't have to It's okay, it's okay Oh really? What does the song say? It's part of the heritage This song is about a woman whose mother died and did not want to leave her So she slept next to her and she never woke up Sounds like a scary song The idea of ​​imagining the future without the person with whom you planned to continue your life What is that? Excuse me, was the last sentence in the song: Who is crying next to me? The island will cry for me, a well of endless tears What is the "endless well of tears"? Is it a real place? It's a stream Thank you very much, thank you Come on, let's go - what's up? - It is written on the chart that the treasure of King (Kalaman) is buried in the well of endless tears I thought it was a metaphor But it is not The well of endless tears is a real place It's a stream There is a stream on the map I think the cemetery is there This is much better than your novels. - What? - No, I didn't mean it, not in that sense. - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What? No - I can see your enthusiasm. ...that would be crazy, I just wanted to It's just that we're so close to him, we can't This is your story, and you are the one who wanted to write it I just want to know where it is and if everything that happens makes sense Well, let's go There will be no harm in one day, at sunrise we will go in search of the endless well of tears What if we don't find anything? - what's the problem? We will have tried What about Fairfax? The police are looking for Fairfax to arrest him This is crazy. Yeah, but look at your enthusiasm. It's the first time I've seen you so brave full of life I'll tell them we've changed our plan, I won't be late I see you met my friend here Tell me you're going to get off on a plane without even saying goodbye I said it is impossible And Loretta wouldn't do something like that, especially since she's the only one who can lead me to the cemetery Don't press my hand keep your hands off me I want a car, does anyone own a car? I want a car, I can exchange it for a watch It's a very expensive watch, do you have a car? It's a Bvlgari brand that glows in the dark and is water-resistant I have a motorcycle Fabulous, isn't it? I thought why your tank doesn't have a mini bar? Do you want a drink? Would you stop it? Yes, I'm afraid he holds you grudges Because of an accident involving his friend's motorcycle Why do you do that? I want something that no one else has ...when my father gave I was saying when my father...given his empire to my little brother Who is this? Is this a Ken doll on a motorcycle? I know him from somewhere I doubt it Because what you're looking at right now is someone highly trained to face battles Learn a lot in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait and Sarasota. His skin is great and he does not suffer from dermatitis And it won't stop until I'm safe So stop this tank, unless you want to perish like his friends did He is responsible for their death You may not have met him before but remember their death Who is this? who is he? I've seen it before No no That's your novel's cover model, isn't it? Yes, I knew that One of you can go upstairs and kill him And kill him in a creative way, I love seeing cute people lose I think I'll have this drink Die Do you mind if I fill the cup? No, it's okay, my God, is this your first time holding a cup? What would Jack Trainer do in a situation like this? It's hot in here, isn't it hot? Are you trying to be sexy? This is so weird, please stop it I can burn your world sleep, sleep, no, no, sleep Time out No, don't shoot her, I need her My God Get your foot away, get your foot away Sleep you bastard big man Faster you ride He or I? This isn't one of your boring, fairy tales, Loretta, it's real life We'll kill him, tell us where the cemetery is The headquarters of the special care and protection of tourists Hello, whoever is in charge here, send the administrators to this place this place We are closed did you shut down? Did you know I've been napping for a year and a half? a year and a half ago I try to work as hard as I can without rest and have been working hard since before my girlfriend was kidnapped I rest and drink wine that I don't even have the energy to drink I want a massage I want someone to massage my shoulders and my feet at the same time I don't care if it doesn't make sense from a logistical point of view because I did my best So I'm kind of asking you to open up for a few more minutes... because if we don't One of my very best friends is going to die, she and her book cover model I don't see any ways What about caves? This is very dangerous Well, we'll be careful then Come on from here It's my rule not to go into any scary caves (Julian) Is his name Julian? He fits the names Buck or Bruce. You go Go, don't be afraid Watch your step good We must not make his death for nothing Moving forward - how do we move forward? we will die - We won't back down now after all Listen, let's go back to the boat so no one else dies No, no, there's a breeze, there's a tunnel, it might lead us to the cemetery Nobody's going to - Speak for yourself, come on. It's like playing slides He might chase a rock - or the back of a troll - ...you're going down the back, no, I mean the tunnel Why is she? - Because you'll stay in the cave to warn us. ...that's impossible, I can't Tell us when you arrive or we will kill your friend Hey, am I in trouble? decent I can't reach, sorry What? Do you smell this scent? You mean the smell of crap that's been here for centuries? Of course I smell this You should take a deep breath, woman Here you are You can, Loretta. I think I see a way out My God It arrived It arrived See? It is very safe go, your turn I'm crossing the tunnel, stay there, okay? Why did they build it in this place? How are they supposed to worship or remember Him without seeing Him? It's not supposed to This is not a trace of Claman's power. It is the lair of a sad woman Queen Taha used to come here for her dead lover She wanted to be alone Taha doesn't want us to be here - Just shut up, Ravi. It's just the volcano. Come on We have to continue Well, let's go strong open it Don't bother them You're going to wear the crown, come on, we didn't come that far to pay respects to the dead I cannot Sorry for that What is that? Are these sea shells? The crown is made of seashells? Where is the treasure? She hugs him Do you mean the dead man? look It's their courtship texts Claman was looking for something on the island rare seashells To prove his love for her, he would bring her a coincidence every day of the year, then gather them in a crown that was red like the fire of their love. Until the day he proposed to her marriage came It was never about jewelry Claman and Taha's fortune was not material It was their love, that's the point, and that's enough Is that all? All that time and money wasted on an old, ridiculous metaphor? We have to go No, no, you'll stay here Since you both see it as beautiful and poetic then you will live The rest of your lives contemplate the richness of that metaphor Get in - what? - All right, okay? - Enter the cemetery. Perhaps it is better to bury alive than to bury the dead do you know that? It's really shameful, great story But you will not live to tell it to anyone Come on, but they're going to die. And you too, if you don't stop being sensitive, come here It's okay, no worse than my nightmares when I was 14 Why are you going so fast? We are not in a race Oh my God, what are you doing? come back here You may own the island, but now you are its slave You can't leave me here come back ravi I want a boat stop, stop Have you seen a woman with black hair and a tight dress with sequins? No, is she in trouble? It's funny I thought a situation like this would be romantic Oh really? Do you mean to stay in a grave? Or dumping us with lava? Or stay with the dead? I mean, stay next to lost love, like Taha did. Sorry I couldn't save you Sorry I couldn't be Dash You're right, you're not like Dash at all You didn't take your white horse and save me I even took a borrowed scooter with a broken muffler yes I couldn't have made Dash like you Because I've never known someone like Alan. I was so afraid that life would hurt my feelings again so I stopped living I couldn't see the good things in front of my eyes I'm so sorry I didn't notice you were there before I have a confession too I really liked the direction our story was taking Maybe I wanted to know what was going to happen The Adventures of Loretta and Alan That would have been a great name, for sure. Ravi must have left it to us How did you forget that lever? You will help us out He left her on purpose - Wow, I've always felt he was a good person. one two Three I wish he hadn't left us here from the start "Pleasure comes after hardship" Pleasure comes after hardship We will climb these trees Don't wait, you don't have to burn trees, okay We can go back to the tunnel No, we can't go back to the tunnel I think I can do it There is a current, we can follow it to lead us to the ocean How will we know what is on the other side? We won't know There is only one way to find out I wouldn't care if I got a rash. - Really? - (right Now) (right Now) (right Now) (right Now) (right Now) oh my god, you're alive Yes - I thought I caused your death. Is this Beth? - (Loretta) - (Beth) You're here, Beth. Why are you here? I told you I'm on your back, girl I'm so sorry, I messed up your dress What? No, I will tell you later I found an Englishman in the cave and thought he was a little boy but it turned out he had a beard It's Fairfax that kidnapped us, Beth. He's a bad guy, Beth, he killed Turner. stop it I'm at your back, girl Why were you running? It's a ship, this guy is so funny got U We'll take you to the island I caught you, no, I didn't catch you We'll take you both, you'll be fine They found sanctuary on a nearby rock and lifted it out of the water His strong arms pulled her and tightened her body Then he (Alan) whispered to her, You are safe now At that moment, Loretta felt that a new adventure was about to begin Novel (Crown of Fire) The desire to miraculously escape from them made her heart beat and ignited her desire for him She was thirsty for the hot lava that was emanating from They taught you not to stop at the good part It's not something you haven't read before Didn't I tell you? It is the most beautiful beach in the world Maybe later I can show you the Enchanted Bay No, you can take Randy. Remember, our friendship is a virginal friendship virginity? I love the pronunciation of this word I don't know what it means but I like the way it is pronounced There you are, Randy. Honey. - You're an angel, thank you. How do you know I'm an angel? Great way to end a book tour, isn't it? You know, I have a phrase I like to use in situations like this "What's Next?" It is a Latin phrase meaning: What next? "What's your opinion?" Restaurant (Boca de Bebo) Yes, I don't know anything about Latin I use it in these moments, like now So what's the next step? How will you write the next novel? - I don't know, how would you write it? - Do you really want me to write it? Try - Ok, I'll write it down. "We were there... standing on a beach" Prepare events for readers so they know how to start Why are you laughing? - I don't laugh, I smile - There are palm trees above the brown bark like the hair of a virgin girl "And there's a dead jellyfish behind" - You're just describing what you're actually seeing - "He's nervous because he really likes her." let's continue He looks deeper into her eyes and compares them to the pulse of the ocean They are the only thing that can compare to the pulse of the ocean "...and beats" You can't use the word: beats - why not? - The beats don't happen that fast But the chimes happen all the time The beats don't happen so fast but gradually What makes your statement true? It's something about Chapter 4 that should be scaled appropriately I guess the beats in all seasons, it's just a beat There is even a prelude to the beats Just go to chapter 5 What if they kiss each other? - Do you mean an ordinary kiss? - Yes, that kiss is at the beginning of the chapters ...I have a good start Do you have any comments? - Fantastic, as a first attempt to start a chapter - { the lost City } Oh my God, oh God... you're dead, your brain came out of your face and reached behind my throat It got in my mouth...Don't say it got in my mouth. I tasted yours We can only use 10% of our brain, so I moved on to the next 10% So... are you okay? one hundred percent This means 10 percent We thought you were dead I usually have anger issues that I need to get rid of Nice to see you man Well, let's turn our conversation down We close our eyes and connect with ourselves Wonderful Wonderful
