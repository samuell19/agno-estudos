THALLI POGATHEY [mobile ringing] -Hello.-Pallavi, where are you? -I'm on my way to shopping, Arun.-Okay. Listen, my friends are coming over for a party this evening. Please plan accordingly. Okay. -Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.-Bye. Bye. -It'll take me a while. -It's ok. Yes? Hi, I am Pallavi. -I'm here for Karthik. -Yeah, he's inside. Shall I come in? -Yeah sure -Okay. Karthik. Karthik. Karthik! I knew you'll come back for me. Karthik... I need to talk to you. One minute, Pallavi. Hi! Ma'am! Sorry, ma'am. I had left the plate behind. So, I had to run back to house... Bharatham is an innate art. The plate has nothing to do with it. You need focus and dedication to become a dancer. I totally understand that, ma'am This is your last chance. Join them. Sorry, ma'am. Neither you have grace nor rhythm. You're a disgrace to this place. I don't get it why you want to learn dance. It's better give this plate to your mother... fill it with delicious food, and eat to your hearts' content. You're only capable of it. -Ma'am one last chance-- -Get lost. Do you really need to learn dance? Come on, tell me. Dance is not going to take you places. Once you graduate, it's best to settle with a Microsoft groom. Instead of discarding your Aadhar and getting a Green card... you're stuck with this razzmatazz. Nisha, when you're cleaning up your room you find an old photo album... and flip through the pictures, it reminds us of the good times frozen as memories. -Agreed? -You're right. Similarly, my activities... my passion for dance, when my future husband and children, look at those pictures and videos, I'll have a gleaming smile on my face. Am I right? That's why. Nisha, life is not about just making money. Life is about making sweet memories. So is the dance. I don't want any memories. My to-be bride... should be modest and submissive. Hope you understood, my dear wife. I'm not your wife. You are my girl. I shouldn't see you anymore dancing or in such attires. I'll be really pissed. Just to humiliate him, I should learn dance. I doesn't matter which dance form it is. Let's go. Wow! -What is it? -I found him. -Found who? -Yes. My dance master. Dance master, uh? Hey, his dance form doesn't come under any category. How can he be a master? Look at him, it's an art. I'm going to kill you. What's wrong with you? He's not an ordinary master... but a mass entertainer. Guys, how are your drinks? Sir, would you like to have a drink? Sir, you've mistaken us. It's just fruit juice. It's been approved by Indian Medical Association. Shut up! Seems like you guys are having fun. -You're her to spoil it. -Fun is overrated, sir. Life has become a struggle. I don't know when I'll get my PhD, a job and settle in life. I have no clue about it. Settling down is just a state of mind. If you take a street vendor for instance... according to him, he's well-settled. Karthik should remain as Karthik... he has to achieve heights. -Shouldn't settle for less. -Do you want him to become a monk? You should settle in such a way that no one can shake you down. I heard you guys haven't paid your hostel fees. -Sir... didn't we pay? -We've never paid it, buddy. Hey, I meant fees, damn it. Hey, you cheque book got drenched in water. Oh, yeah, my cheque book. Sir, cheque book got drenched. We've put it for dry. Full speed, it'll be dry in no time. It's a very powerful fan. It'll be dried soon. Listen, without clearing the hostel dues, you can't enter the classroom. Be careful! Sir, I'll pay the fees. But make sure you don't come to the class. It's a shame that you call him your Godfather. -These money minting techniques. -Who knows. Let's go. Hey, he's over there. -Hey. -Greetings, sir. Jesus blesses you with good health. Also he blesses you with long hair-- I meant long life, long life. -Who the hell are you? -I'm Pallavi. I'm a medical college student. I want to learn dance. Fine, learn dance. What do you want from me? You have to take me as your student. I don't get it? Madam, if he's not ready, I'll take you as my student. Kala master was my student. -He's a fraud, Pallavi. -What's bothering her? Who told you that I take dance lessons? A while ago, you were dancing. I couldn't take my eyes off you. -You were extremely professional. -Awesome. You were graceful. Oh, no, she's smitten. -Listen here, Janaki. -I'm Pallavi, not Janaki. Fine, Pallavi, it doesn't matter. I'm a PhD student. And I'm extremely busy. I have no time for this. Please find someone else. -Who are these girls? -I don't know. They've been ranting nonsense. You don't have to do it for free. I'll definitely pay a fee for it. It'll be great if you state your fee. -Buddy, Jesus has blessed us. -Yes. Our problems will be solved. How much is the hostel fee? It's 500 rupees each. Just pretend to contemplate and agree to it. Jesus, please bless us all. I want to although... I want to, uh... Even Rajamouli wouldn't have taken so long. You're over acting. Stop it right away. Madam, how much can you pay? Five hundred. -Thousand-- -Five thousand. -5000 is it?! -Five thousand... That's like hundred 50's. -Agree to it. -It's a small fee though -I'm not keen about the money. -Don't mess it up. Your dream is important than money. Madam, now that sir has agreed. You can pay an advance. First practice then comes payment. Why not first advance then dance? Hey. Fine, we'll start the classes from tomorrow. You can roll her to the class as well. -Thank you, master. -There she goes again. Bye, master. You've become a Master, before Thalapathy did. My friend is a master, now. He's a master. He's a master! Why is she greeting like Power star? Amazing! Amazing! Shall we begin? What is dance? The power from the entire universe... we should spiritually embrace them. We should cleanse our breath. As a fragment of music... we'll transform our worldly body. I thought he was conning her, but he sounds genuine. -Understood? -Understood, master. Bloody, he dances high on liquor. But conning her with literature. She sounds like a chronic alcoholic. [music playing] Shut up. We're not here for an orchestra. Hey, play our traditional music. Sure, seer. Move your hand, damn it. [peppy folk music playing] Wow, superb! Superb! -That was excellent, you nailed it. -Thank you, buddy. You were amazing. Were you able to grasp the dance technique? -I did, master. -Why don't you show me? Oh, no, buddy. She's gone mad. Hey, stop it! You're dancing like a doofus with no grace. This is dance, not a joke. [sighs] What are you doing? When you shake your head, only the head should be shaking. When you shake your hip, only the hip should be shaking. If your whole body shakes at the same time... you'll look like a monkey getting spasm. Please say something. Did you understand? Understood. How would she know, if you're not teaching her right? Boss, you gotta teach her according to her grasp. Can you please repeat what you said earlier? You'll look like a monkey getting a spasm. Not that, the one prior to it. When you shake your head, only the head should be shaking. -Hip-- -Exactly. I have an idea. Until I perfect the technique... when I shake my hip, you hold my head. And when I shake my head, you hold my hip. Okay? Madam, we took a fee to teach you dance. To do other stuff, master will demand more fee. I'm TR fan, I won't touch women. Master, there's no harm in it. The blissful art inside of you... is waking up my passion for art. I'm not sure it's the blissful art speaking or something else. Come on, master. Let's give it a try. Hey! I did warn you not to dance. But you don't seem to listen. How many times should I say this? That I don't like my wife doing such things. -Is that her husband? -No. Who is that? He's my dance master. Hey, who the hell are you? You look like a moron though. Hey! If I see you again with him... It's better you run away from here. Hey! Pallavi. You never mentioned that you're married. Oh, no. I'm not married. He's my senior from college. They asked me to be his pretend-wife during ragging. Since then he has been troubling me. Tell him that you don't like this behaviour. I'm literally scared of his face. Fine, ask him to come to the park tomorrow evening. For what? To offer him herbal juice. Master has said it, so ask him to come. Hi. Hi. Master, I'm very nervous. Do you have a plan in place? Look around you. -What do you see? -They're trimming the plants. They're not clippers... but new model CCTV cameras. Do you see that man walking? He's a Para-Commando. A senior officer. Look over there. The man making juice is a cop too. Do you see that lady out there? Yeah. She's the Chief of Womens' Chamber Security. Do you know why they're in civil clothes? I understood. They're undercover. You have to just do one thing. You should provoke him and make him touch you. The next moment he lays his hand on you... the undercover sub-inspector will arrest him under Gunda's Act. Understood? Master. He has arrived. I'm really scared, master. I'm right here. Don't worry about it. Stay right there. You challenged my manhood and asked me to come over, right? Here I am. Is this man enough for you? Or do you want me to something more to prove? Tell me! What do you think of yourself? What will you do? Come on, tell me. Don't think, that your huge appearance will intimidate me. Do you really think I'll be scared of you? Nah, I'm not scared at all. You're going overboard. -I dare you to touch me. -You'll regret it. Can you? -I dare you to touch me. -Don't, you'll regret it. -I said don't do it. -Let me see, if you can. -Come on, do it. -Don't! -I will touch you. -Do it. Don't instigate me. Hey... touch me damn it. Master, I spoke a lot. He got scared and ran away. Thank you so much. I have to thank everyone. Pallavi. They're not undercover cops. I lied to boost your courage. Master? I did nothing. Just introduced you to your own courage. That's it. "You're my fruition to my penance" "I'm flying high on cloud nine" "Are you the melody that's grazing me like a wind" "You've infused rhythm in my life" "Maya, you're my stupendous query..." "...buried deep in heart" "Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!" "Your eyes are nothing less than a carnival" "Hey, I've gone past the phase of sorrow" "my heart is now filled with prelude of happiness." "Oh, yeah!" "Oh, yeah!" "My heart is filled with prelude of happiness." "My heart was once ice-cold..." "but now it takes leaps of love." "Oh, yeah!" "Oh, yeah!" "It now takes leaps of love." Master. The courage you introduced to me gave me happiness too. If you're part of my life. I think, I'll be more happier. I don't know what is happening to me? I felt like sharing it with you. So, I did. That's it. Pallav-- Due to vacation, we'll be closing the hostel. Karthik, my friend is running a coaching center on Applied Statistics in Hyderabad. You do one thing, tomorrow head to Hyderabad. You can stay right there. Take tuition. And earn money to fund your next semester. Here you go. Sir, I can't leave Chennai now. I sense there's more to this hesitation. -Who is the girl? -It's Pallavi, sir. Huh, sir-- there's no one. Pallavi, that's a nice name. Sit down. What are you going to do during the holidays? I'm planning to rent a place. And conduct tuition. Listen, this is Chennai. A smart city. Here, shopping malls, metro trains, multi-level car parking... you can find them all. But you can't find a house to live. Understand? I doubt anyone will rent you a house during this water scarcity. I'll use paper, sir. Disgusting! Luck is favoring you in Hyderabad. But love is holding you back in Chennai. Do as you please. -Good luck. -Thanks, sir. My dear! Tell me, dad. The tap upstairs in your bathroom has been leaking, please shut it. -Sure, will check on it. -He has started cribbing. And these girls don't change ever. Uncle, your coffee. You know that I don't take coffee before breakfast. Listen, what about the Suguna company... our dealer. We were suppose to write them a cheque today, right? Today is Friday. It's not auspicious to write cheques. Thank god, you reminded me of that. Here you go. What is this? Love letter. Who gave this to you? Grandpa, our tenant who lives upstairs... gave this letter to aunty. -Omkar! -Uncle. -Come over here. -Thank you. -Tell me, what is it? -Take a look. "My dear Sweet-pea, shall we hang out at the beach?" What the hell is this? The guy upstairs has written a love letter to Pallavi. Sir, I swear I didn't write this. I've never heard that song in my life. -Sir, I'm Thalapathy fan. -Don't lie. -Brother, please believe me. -I gave you Wi-Fi password. You didn't give it for free. I paid 500 bucks for it. How dare you write a love letter to my daughter? Sir, I can't even write a leave letter without googling it. Sir, I don't know how to write a love letter. Don't lie. Don't lie, damn it. -Get lost! -He's lying about being Thalapathy fan. That's why I asked you not to rent the place to bachelors. -Stop nagging. -You never listen to me. Hey, hang that to-let board. I'll do it right away. Dad! Go. Psst. Go! Finalize the old pricing. -Go ahead. -Rathnam, sir? -That's me. -I'm Karthik. Hello. Greetings. Sir, I heard that you have a place to rent. What do you do? I'm doing my PhD at Loyola College. -Oh, so you're still pursuing studies. -Yes, sir. Source of income? Sir... I get a stipend from the PhD. It's a very well-funded research, sir. Oh, is it? What is your research about? Informatics and Statistics. What is that? Informatics is one type of accounting. Will that research fetch you a nice job? Sir, it has a great value. What is poverty line... the permitted level of radiation at the factories, also the glucose level in our body. The movement of the entire world is governed by statistics. Statistics is superpower. Superpower doesn't concern me. It's enough, if you pay the rent on time. Sir, the rent will be paid on time. In fact, I tutor my juniors too. Oh, that sounds great. You can tutor my grandson too. Sure, sir. My pleasure. Which college is he from? He's in the fifth grade. Heavy syllabus. No problem, sir. I'm ready to tutor anyone in your family. Son... you have made a good impression on me. Than you, sir. Come tomorrow, I'll show you around the house. Sir, if you're free, we can go right now. Is that so? -Pallavi. -Yes, dad. I'll show him around the house. You handle things over here. Okay, dad. Let's go. Son, do you have a girlfriend? Oh, no. Nothing of that sort, sir. I don't know anything about it. What do you don't know? All those antics which surrounds it. Growing a beard. These things doesn't suit me. Phew! Thank god, you're not a victim of it. Stop right here. Come on. -Son-in-law. -Yes, uncle. -This is Omkar. -Namaskar! This is Karthik. He's here to check out the house. Show him around and discuss other details. -Okay. -You can go with him. You're very lucky. There are 365 people waiting to rent this place. Does that mean 365 people are going to live in the same house? -Not funny. -But you look funny. Enough of comedy. The monthly rent is Ten thousand rupees. But, uncle mentioned, it's only seven thousand. Uncle? He's uncle to me. To you he's just a house owner. But owner said it's seven thousand. That's right. I'm the middle man between you and my uncle. I'm like the toll booth. If you pay me the difference, liquor, smoke etc-- Wow! So, you'll provide me with it. Nope, I'll just ignore if you do. Most important thing. The Wi-Fi is free. Do you conserve rain water? It leaks when it rains. May be we conserve if required. Perfect. I like this house a lot. My father-in-law is impressed by you. He doesn't ride on a bike with strangers. Just keep in mind... the dealing between us stays secret. Don't let my father-in-law know about it. I won't tell anyone. But you gotta be careful. These days toll-booths are the first to get destroyed during riots. But I believe you're not a violent person. What took you so long? Dad! Dad, no matter how many times we say, you don't listen. What? What happened, dear? Why did you rent the place to a bachelor? Hey, don't judge everyone with same perspective. That boy is a gentleman. I'm sure we won't face any issues. Okay? Go and have your dinner. Dad is right. Don't judge people too soon. Bachelors are easy to vacate. Moreover he agreed to pay me the commission. Commission? Uncle, I meant the rent. God help him. Again if someone comes over and hands me a love letter... I'll be damn pissed. Not a chance. I'll make sure to evict him right away. Let's play music! Hi, I'm Ashwin. Get lost. Grandpa said you're my new tuition teacher. -Tell me, house owner. -Here you go. My Maths book. I don't understand a thing. Even I don't understand anything. I thought you were pursuing PhD. How come you don't know? Pursuing PhD is a tough job. -Day and night-- -I don't care. I'll be back by 6 PM. Make sure you're ready to teach. If you don't, then I'll ask my grandpa to kick you out of the house. Awesome! I'll be prepared. -Come back at 6 PM. -You better. Bye. Master. Hope you're comfortable. Do you like the house? Everything is good. But I don't like that you address me as master. You can call me Karthik, Pallavi. Here you go. I made pongal. I've added cashews to it. Thanks. I'm heading to college. "Your eyes are mesmerizing..." "...like a never ending blessing." "The footprints off your path..." "...are imprinted like a picture on my mind." "Like a child that hides his toys..." "...your love chases after me." "When your face fades off daily into the sunset" "...the cool breeze graces me with love" "soaked in love" "Hey, I've gone past the phase of sorrow" "My heart is now filled with prelude of happiness." "Oh, yeah!" "Oh, yeah!" "My heart is filled with prelude of happiness." "My heart was once ice-cold..." "but now it takes leaps of love." "Oh, yeah!" "Oh, yeah!" "It now takes leaps of love." [music mutes voices] "When I usher your name..." "that gives me immense peace." "Your presence is nothing less" "...than a celebration" "Unfulfilled desires in my heart..." "has been murking in my heart." "Your graceful touch makes me..." "...flutter like a pigeon." "My love sways me away" "You're my fruition to my penance" "I'm flying high on cloud nine" "Are you the melody that's grazing me like a wind" "You've infused rhythm in my life" "Maya, you're my stupendous query..." "...buried deep in heart" "Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!" "Your eyes are nothing less than a carnival" "Hey, I've gone past the phase of sorrow" "My heart is now filled with prelude of happiness." "Oh, yeah!" "Oh, yeah!" "My heart is filled with prelude of happiness." "My heart was once ice-cold..." "but now it takes leaps of love." "Oh, yeah!" "Oh, yeah!" "It now takes leaps of love." -Where's the bike? -I have no clue. Sorry, Karthik. You don't have to apologize. We can buy a car after marriage. But we can't buy our memories attached to that bike. After we get married... I want to ride on that bike with our kids. That's why, I want that bike back. We'll definitely find it. Don't worry. Hey, what is this? I can't comprehend Tamil. I'll whack if you say that about mother tongue. Can't you teach him, Tamil? Aren't you the Tamil expert? You try teaching him. You guys are influenced by English. What happened? How did you get drenched? It's not even raining outside. Dad, it's not like it won't rain in other places. Oh, okay, okay. Hey, wipe your hair dry. You continue writing. Hey, superpower! Sir. It's not raining. But you look drenched. I-- I was... You're coming from Meenambakkam, right? You're awesome, sir. You've surpassed Tamilnadu's weatherman. Sir, sir... if I'm superpower, then you're supreme power. -Enough. That's enough. -He bought it! [mobile ringing] Tell me, Pallavi. Karthik, the guys who stole our bike... I've spotted them. -I'm following them at the moment. -Pallavi-- I'll share my live location. Can you come immediately? Boss. The bike looks amazing, right? I've told you million times to change the number plate. Sorry we forgot in a hurry. You guys are going to get me into trouble. You guys never pay heed to rules. You'll understand only when the trouble lands on us. Here comes the problem! What do you want? That's our bike. -Bike. -Do you have the RC book? That's our bike. Oh, the number plate! Now it's not. Now it's gone. What do you have to say now? Don't mess with me. Brother, hold on. That's not our bike. -Sorry, she mistook it for ours. -Karthik, that's ours. That's not our bike, Pallavi. No, Karthik. I just saw him throw the number plate. Pallavi, listen, that's not our bike. -Come on, Pallavi. -Karthik. -Karthik, that's our bike... -Let's go. -and I won't leave without it. -Get lost! Thanks brother. Karthik. Don't bother, let's go. Pallavi, you wait outside for five minutes. I'll discuss with him and get my bike. Just wait outside for five minutes. -You go, I'll come soon. -What are you doing? Please hear me out. Hey, brother! The RC book might carry your name. Let me test-ride the bike for two days. Later, you can take it. Boss, the bike looks hot. Let's savor it. What? Hey, open the gate! [movie playing on TV] Dear. Please have your milk. Here, drink it. Listen, let's not pursue the match we met recently. He's four years elder to her. Do you know his line of work? I know, they said he's a pilot. What else do you need? We can't find a better match. He earns sufficiently and is well-settled. Age difference is not a big deal. When we got married, there was a age difference too. Aren't you living like a queen now? -Am I right, Latha? -Yes. It was the same case when I and Latha got married too. In all these years I've never touched her. -Hello! -I meant, I never raised my hand. Am I not taking good care of her. In my opinion, she's taking good care of you. Dad, last night at the function... everyone was asking about Pallavi's wedding. Obviously, everyone will ask. That doesn't mean we should get her married... to any Tom, Dick and Harry. We have to tread carefully. he's my friend, will help us out. Don't be in a hurry. Sir, why did you call me? Karthik, you will have to leave to Delhi tomorrow. What's the matter? You'll have to meet Jaswant Singh at JNU. He's the Head of Informatics Department. He's my college friend. He's starting a new thesis next month. There's a vacancy available. If you work under him in this project. Your PhD will carry a great weight. Even before you complete it, you'll have a job in hand. -Sir. -Enough with the drama. You don't have to say anything, just say, yes. Okay. I'll take care of everything else. Hey, bugger let go of me. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you, sir. You can hug Pallavi. No silly feelings, okay. Thank you, sir. Hey, Pallavi. Perfect timing. I was about to call you myself. I have to speak to you about something important. Can we... can we meet now? Where? Hey, Pallavi. I have a good news. You know what, at the college-- Karthik, let's get married. -What? Marriage? -Let's elope and get married. Sure, we'll get married. What's the hurry? Karthik, I'm really worried. My family has started looking for a match. My parents are going to find a suitor soon. I don't want that to happen. Let's elope. I totally understand your concern. But I don't see the need to elope... Karthik, you don't understand what I'm trying to say. If I elope after they fix my marriage with someone else... that will tarnish my family's image. Let's elope now. Pallavi, please understand. Don't worry about money. I'll take care of it. Pallavi, money is not the problem here. Fine, give me a weeks' time. Let's not risk it. Anything could happen in a week. Pallavi, please understand. Pallavi, you don't get it. Let's not act in haste. Karthik... ...you will marry me, right? Dad, many have liked, Pallavi's profile. Hey, superpower. Come over here. -Are you heading home? -Yes, sir. -I'll come along. -Sure. Thank you. You can go now. Seems like you're calculating something. Nothing of that sort, sir. We're going to Tirupathi with the entire family. You come along as well. Sir, you please carry on. I'm planning to offer pilgrimage after my marriage. You have a plan in place for everything. Don't try to create scene over here. Look, I'm not here to create a scene. First, please hear me out. It doesn't matter what you have to say. It's better that you leave from here. Please hear me out. -Get out, damn it. -How dare you step into our house? -You get inside the house. -Selvam, Selvam. -Shut up. -What happened, Selvam? This boy here is in love with my daughter, it seems. And he's demanding to get married to her right away. He's blackmailing stating that he'll do some harm. -Shut up. -Get out from here. -I said, get out. -Hold on, Selvam. Sir, their daughter is in love with me too. We love each other dearly. There's nothing wrong about my demands. Wait here. Is he telling the truth? -Yes. -Are you serious? I really don't see any harm in getting married. Obviously, it's not wrong. But the way you're putting it across is wrong. -What do you do? -I've graduated college. Just graduating college is not enough. I can manage by running a garage. You people don't have to worry about it. How can we not worry about it? Hey, how can we not worry about it? Hey, he didn't raise his daughter to be an ordinary women. She studied in one of the best schools in the city. Graduated from one of the top colleges in Tamilnadu. He has a mini library inside the house, so that she can study well. Do you even know about their bank balance, premium health insurance? He worked hard to achieve all of it. He must've gone through a lot of humiliation. You have no idea about his sacrifices... all you did was just graduate from the college. Hey, what can you even offer her? I don't want any of it. -Shut up. -All I want is, him. My dear... you may feel that way now. Being the world to each other. Only after the marriage you'll face the real world. Even going to movies will be a task. And buying clothes during the festivals... you'll have to wait for discounts. Your friends and colleagues will be holidaying abroad. And you'll be making excuses that travel doesn't suit you. Sir, do you really think, she'll suffer after marrying me? If you guys get married right now, not only you'll suffer... but your future child will suffer too. Now I understood. She and I are not from the same caste. Isn't that your problem? To hell with the caste. I don't even know which caste you belong to. You can't even understand the basic principles of humanity... and painting a racist picture. Hey, if you can take good care of our daughter... get married to her. Take her and leave from here. If you can't... then get out, damn it. I know how to resolve this matter. I'll handle it. -Come on, let's go. -Get lost! Selvam, don't worry about it. We'll sort it out. Don't be in a hurry. Take her inside. Everyone please leave. The current generation is always in a hurry. The treat life as a video game. Only a handful... pursue proper education and understand life. Someone like you. I don't know what to say. Let's go. Let's go. -Thanks, son. See you later. -Okay, sir. Is everything okay? If you can take good care of our daughter, better than us. Take her away, and get married to her. If you can't... ...then get out, damn it. If we wish to stay happy even after the marriage. We have to achieve something in our life. I've got a great opportunity in my career. Just one year. I'll come along too. Pallavi, why don't you understand? Let's get married with blessings from everyone. Why don't you give that a thought? Because, I'm scared, Karthik. What if they get me married to someone else during this year? Nothing of that sort will happen. If such situation arises, I'll come back right away. It won't matter who stops me, I'll take you away. Karthik... love gives you just one chance. If we don't come together, then it will never happen. There are no second chances in love. Superpower, how come you're leaving all of a sudden? Looks like you're traveling far. Sir, things we look for are always right in front of our eyes. But to attain them we have to take a long path. Another one of your calculations I believe. Hope it goes well. All the best. "Oh' dear love you've beguiled my heart" "I'm finding it hard to keep away from you" "Separation is the price you pay to realize the worth of love" "Solitude is the wave that brings us together" "Just like the clouds and river are apart" "A transitory life which keeps dragging me around..." "...making sense of my senseless life..." "I've surrendered my life to you." "Your name just creates a magic..." "...if ushered gives me will to live" "Your face prints are still on my chest..." "...that will never fade off my body" "My dreams will pretend to prevail" -Kala! -Come sooner. -What happened? -I'll explain, hurry up. -What's the emergency? -First, let's go inside. Your folks said, you like to dance. I too have taken Bharathnatyam classes from Kalashetra. Does she know to cook? Yeah, she'll eat well if we cook for her. I'm just joking. She takes recipes from YouTube and cook all the cuisines. Nothing of that sort. He's just pulling her leg. Pallavi is a very good cook. -Thanks for coming. -Thank you. -Go safe. -Glad that you came down. -Our pleasure. -Please let us know. Pallavi. Hello... Karthik! Hey, today I'm submitting the thesis paper. In just three months... ...you'll be addressing me as Dr.Karthik. Wish me luck. Pallavi... Hello... All the best. Karthik... Yeah sir, coming. Pallavi, I'll call you back. Pallavi, you have tell Karthik about it. Shall I call him? No need, Nisha. If he comes to know, he'll abandon his career. I might be happy for now. They'll blacklist him at the university. Later, if someone blames me for his failure... I definitely can't bear that. No need. A lot happened beyond our expectations... I couldn't get over you. Pallavi, I'm living without you... But now you're here. I just came looking for you. But I'm not here to live with you. Your professor called me. Hello. Hello, Pallavi. I'm Karthik's professor, Duraisamy speaking. Hello, sir. How are you? It's been ages since you called. I'm doing well. How are you? I'm doing really well. How is Karthik? Back then, he was about to finish his PhD. He must've landed a job at a huge company. Dear, I called to speak to you about, Karthik. After he finished his PhD, he came to know about your marriage. He couldn't bear that news. He was not able to digest that truth. He was really depressed. In order to get him out of that depression... I got him placed in a huge American company. What are you doing man? Is this the type of work you do in this office? He did take up the job. But... I say, get out! I said, out! ...nothing went well. He has become an alcoholic. He stopped going to work. If he doesn't go to the office for next ten days... they'll blacklist him. He is my best student. His career will be destroyed. His situation is dire... Sorry! -Sorry, dear. -Sir? Karthik. So, you're here to empathize. Nothing but sympathy. That's not the case, Karthik. Then, what do you call it? Shall I tell you the truth? You're not able to let go of me. Girls like you get married to keep their folks happy... but live your life in regret to have not pursued your love. You don't have to keep up this act. I'm here for you. Just say the word. Right here, right now, we'll start a new life. I'm not being selfish. It's the best option for us. I know that you still love me, Pallavi. You're just hesitating to admit it. I understand. It's enough, if one of us has the courage to take this step. Come on, Pallavi. Oh, no! You don't seem to understand, Karthik. I'm happy with Arun. I have no qualms. I'm really happy with my life. I really don't have any dreams to fulfill. More than unfulfilled desires... to me Arun's love is precious. Pallavi, you're lying. This lie won't help us. Tell me the truth. You don't love me anymore? No. Look me in the eye. Come on, look at me. Right now, you're not my love. Then why are you here? Why do you care, what happens to me? Doesn't matter if I lose my job or I die. Why do you care? I'm here to stop that from happening. I took that decision... 'cause your career was important than our love. I don't want that decision to go in vain. I can't just let you destroy it. If that's your decision. Then leave behind everything and come with me. You're suffering out there, how can I be happy? Karthik. It doesn't matter how long it takes. I'll be waiting for you. Karthik, please listen to me. Please hear me out. Pallavi. Are you alright? Pallavi. I met Karthik, today. Prior to our wedding, when I mentioned about Karthik... ...it was pacifying when you understood. Since then I never looked back at my life. I'm happier than I expected. And it's all 'cause of you. But Karthik... thinks I'm not happy and destroying himself. I wished that he lead a successful life. But he's living a total opposite life. I think, I'm the reason for his failure. And I feel really guilty about it. I don't know what to do. He can't just assume that I'm not happy. He doesn't realize that I'm happy with my life. Arun. He has to witness. He should see that I'm leading a happy life with you. That will change his perception. And he'll stop drinking. For just ten days, if Karthik could stay with us... ...he'll make sense of everything. Are you okay with it? Please forgive me, if I had said something wrong. Pallavi, I really don't care about the others. You're important to me. If Karthik staying with us for ten days... will resolve this issue, and if that makes you happy, you can invite him by all means. I have no issues. Come, let's celebrate your birthday. Thank you so much. It's okay. Thank you so much. It's okay! You want me to come over and live with you guys? Karthik, you've been spoiling your life... thinking I'm not happy with my life. Just ten days, stay with us. Take a closer look at our life. I'm definitely not living a double life. You'll realize it yourself, that Arun and I are leading a happy life. What If I understood? Forget about everything and resume your job. Start a new life. What if you're still in love with me... and realize you're living a double life? Will you abandon everything and come with me? Pallavi, you know the truth well. That's why you're silent. Okay, Karthik. You come over and learn the truth. I'm coming. I'll stay with you for ten days at your house. Pallavi, you said love doesn't give you a second chance. But now you're giving me a second chance. I won't miss this opportunity. See you soon. [door bell rings] Run Pallavi. Hi, Karthik. Hi! Eh, Pallavi! Arun meet Karthik. Karthik. Hi. -Please come in. -Come. Come. What's up, Amul baby? Shall we have a drink? Hey, Karthik. Good morning. Coffee? Make it yourself. What? You've been single for long, and can't make a pot of coffee? I think you should learn to make your own coffee. Would you do the same, if Arun asks for coffee too? You'll make one for him, right? Karthik, get married sooner. You can have coffee all the time. So, coffee is the reason you got married to Pallavi? This is too much. Pallavi, were you in a hurry? The food looks uncooked. Karthik, this is musa-musa salad. Very good for health. Arun is very health conscious. Back in my place, this is the staple for the sick. Oh, I'm sorry. Does Arun have any health issues? He has no health issues. Why don't you try changing your diet too? This won't suit my taste. Pallavi you used to make, Pongal (Indian Dish). You don't make it anymore? You know what, Arun... The Pongal, Pallavi used to make for me was awesome. She used to add clarified butter, black pepper... seasoned with cashews, the dish will taste absolutely delicious. It'll just glide through your mouth. What was the ingredient that you used to add at the end? Was it Jasmine? Jasmine in a Pongal? That was not Jasmine. Coriander! Coriander, indeed. Have you stopped making it? Pallavi, it's imperative that you only have to cook what I like. You can cook your favorite dishes too. I'll definitely have them. Arun, that's not the case. I'm not doing this just for you. I'm doing this for us. Musa-musa! Excuse me. Husband is my beloved lord. Blessed is the bridegroom. A movie which I missed watching during my childhood. You pretend well as a doted wife. Karthik, don't be too smart. Pallavi, I'm running late for work. I'm leaving. Oh, no! I'm running late too. I'll leave as well. What about me? Karthik, it's a very peaceful neighborhood. You can sit at home, read books, listen to music... in fact you can meditate too. And I think you need it. Am I your guest or a watchman to your house? Not happening. I can't stay alone. I'll either come with you or Arun. You guys decide, who's going to take me out. Karthik, seat belt. We're heading to my office. You can relax and chill there. You play snooker? No, just cricket. What about food? You just finished your breakfast. I don't count that as a breakfast. You guys eat salad for breakfast. I wonder what you'll have for lunch. Karthik, if someone asks tell them you're my childhood friend. Don't say anything else, okay? Is it fine, if I say that I am Pallavi's Ex? -Good morning, sir. -Morning. -Good Morning, sir. -Yeah, morning. Their wishes are very emotional. Pallavi used to call me "Master" with love. Correct. Not just you, Pallavi calls a dog too with love. That's her nature. Cheer up, Karthik. Insults are part of the package. That doesn't stop me from trying. -Narayanan! -Yes, sir. How do you know my name? There'll be a Narayanan in every IT office. It's a most natural selection. Have you lost your senses? What the hell have you done? You've done one of the stupidest thing. The consequences are going to be brutal. Have you really gone mad? No, Nisha. I'm in my senses. I want him to realize it too. That's why I did it. If you walk away from issues, it may look huge to you. But when you embrace them, it will be resolved. It's gonna stink! It's your mess, do as you please. Don't ever call me for support. I'm hanging up. Nisha! We both were dancing... What happened next? What do you think? She got married to someone else and moved to Europe. -Oh, Shit! -Shit, shit. Every household has a story of sorrow and deceit. Karthik, shall we leave? Arun, please hold on. The story has just reached, Europe. What story? Karthik has penned the story for director Mani Ratnam's next film. The title is; "Once Again, waves are flowing" Fine, everyone get to their work. We have deadlines to complete. Karthik! Come back tomorrow, Karthik. Guys, ta-ta, bye-bye. Okay, bro. Take care. -Bye. -Bye. It's yum. Really good. Pallavi. What happened? Nothing, don't bother. If you share, I can laugh too. -It's so happened-- -Nothing, brother. -I'll tell the story. -No, I'll tell him. -Hey, I will tell him. -Fine, go ahead. -Once, in Chennai-- -Let me tell you... -it was-- -No, I'll tell him. Fine, you tell him. In Chennai, next to Saidapet railway station, there's a hotel. -I and Karthik-- -It's nothing brother... madam loves to eat Biryani. So, I took her to my favorite restaurant. The bill arrived once we were done eating. She challenged me to runaway without paying the bill. I just started walking out from there... then the hotel owner started to chase me. But he was not able to match my speed. So, they stopped. That's about it. -Don't believe him. -That's about it. That was not the case. I'll tell you the truth. If we runaway from the hotel without paying the bill... it was his idea, that it'll be adventurous. We agreed and ran away from there. Since that day, even if he walks past Saidapet... he used to have his helmet on all the time. That's not funny. I took up the challenge, 'cause she said it'll be adventurous. I'm not a person who doesn't pay for the food. Huh, don't lie! At Besant Nagar beach, from Annai Fish Stall... you had five plates of seer fish. Who do you think paid for it? It was paid from my supermarket's cash register. Yeah, right. What about the sweet treats from Basha Halwa? Who paid for it? What about midnight ice-cream escapades? Did all of it came from your supermarket? I paid for all of it. Supermarket, my foot. Hey, don't speak ill of my supermarket. Hey, I will talk ill about it. Horrible store. The chocolates at their supermarket will be soggy. None of their refrigerators worked. And they call it a Supermarket! I've always given you good stuff. That's 'cause it was from another store. You're too much. What? What happened? No, nothing. Please finish your meal. Hey, Pallavi. [knife swooshes] Arun. Arun, have you gone mad? He had a knife. Could've hurt you. That too for an ordinary handbag. Karthik, that's not an ordinary handbag. That's my first gift to Pallavi. You look at it as an object. But to me it's a sweet memory. Arun. I'm okay. I'm okay. Karthik. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Hold on, where are you guys going? Karthik, it's already midnight. You too try and get some sleep. How can I sleep when you two are going to sleep together? -What? -I'm scared, damn it. Arun, it's horrible to be single and sleeping alone in a bungalow. You know how scared I was to stay alone in the penthouse. So? So... Pallavi, you get to bed. I'll sleep in Karthik's room. Tomorrow we have an early morning trek. Be ready, okay? Goodnight. Goodnight. Karthik. Tell me, Pallavi. Sweet dreams. Bro... do you snore? Sometimes. I snore all the time. Don't worry, our snores will nullify the sound. We can sleep peacefully. This is the third time, I'm saying this. Goodnight. Guys, trekking is not just a physical activity. It's a spiritual discovery. You can discover your new-self in these mountains. If we head to Himalayas, we can meet Superstar Rajinikanth. Joke! Don't bother. That was a nice joke. -Thanks buddy. -It's okay. Guys! Hey, guys. Can we have your attention please? We have an announcement to make. -Birthday? -No. -Baby? -Actually, no. The thing is... we've decided to get separated. What?! Come, on. We thought you guys were made for each other. We too had the same perception, when we got married. Only after we lived together, we knew... that it's not true. We're totally different from each other. Nothing is working out. Neither we can comprehend with each other. We don't have any reason left to love each other. We decided it's better to get separated when we have such clarity. We've mutually decided to get divorced. Buddy, listen to me. Okay. I know it's hard. Don't make hasty decisions, okay. Take your time. Everything will get back to normal, if you guys have a baby. You both have been preaching like you're their in-laws How would a baby solve the problem? There's a psychology behind what we say. -Bro, brilliant decision. -Yeah. You guys have made the right decision. In a marriage... it's not imperative for two people to compromise all the time. If you guys are not at peace... there's no harm if you feel it's peaceful to live apart. There's no need for you guys to pretend to love each other... no one's going to erect a monument for your sacrifice. On top of it, a baby. Look, a child should be labor borne out of love, but not lust. Their fights and indifference will ruin their lives... so it will ruin the child's life too. Brother, you made the right decision. You go ahead. My full support is with you. Thank you, Karthik! Good decision, brother. -That was a bad speech. -You just didn't get it! Pallavi, what is this? Poached eggs. Health conscious, is it? It was a joke, brother. Joke. Arun, bro. -Bro... -I'm right here, tell me. -You don't drink? -No. Women are great. They'll fall in love with a boy who has bad habits... But, when it comes to marriage... they'll marry a good boy with no bad habits. Don't take me wrong. I'm a little drunk. Karthik. Don't! That's enough. How many matches did you reject before getting married to Pallavi? Around four to five. So, Pallavi was your fifth match. In case, one out of the four was your option... you wouldn't have got married to Pallavi, right? So, Pallavi was an option to you. Not a choice. It's not the same for me. She's my life. I wanted to get married and live until death do us apart. So mine is true love, isn't it? Karthik, you're drunk. No, Pallavi. Let him talk, it's okay. Have you ever spoken a lot to Pallavi before the marriage. We've spoken a lot. Arun is broad-minded. He never expected me to change myself after the marriage. You never asked her, if she was in love with someone? She's very naive. She might've told you, if you'd asked her. If she had told you... I wouldn't be wandering like a fool now. Karthik, that's enough. Please go and sleep. I can sleep only if I'm sleepy. I can never pretend to sleep. Karthik, please have something to eat. Forget about it. I've been meaning to ask this for a very long time. Shall I? Go ahead. A woman unhappy with her marriage... decides to elope with someone, what do you call it? Uh... some illegal affair. Illegal Affair! For instance, the girl I was in love with... gets married to you. Why isn't it called, Illegal marriage? Pallavi. Pallavi, what is this? Pallavi! [vehicles honking] [door bell rings] -How are you, dear? -Dad! -How was the surprise? -Amazing. If we had informed, we would've missed this reaction. How's brother-in-law? He's doing well. Please come inside. The house looks like the ones' in abroad. Idiot, we're abroad now. Where's is son-in-- Coffee! Hey, how come he's here? What are you doing over here? Father-in-law, when did you arrive? -Hi, Arun. -How are you? I'm doing well. This is Karthik, my childhood friend. -Is it? -Yes. But you never mentioned. Yes, sir. We known Karthik from before. He was our tenant. On the terrace. On the terrace! -Good. -He works nearby. It's his off period. So, he came down to stay with us for a while. -Oh, oh. -Yes, my best friend. Not bad, superpower. You managed to settle abroad. The world is truly very small. Yes, sir. A small world. -Dad! -Tell me, dear. You must be tired. -Please freshen up. -Sure. Uncle, it's really cold. It'll be best to take shots than bath. Shut up! High five! Karthik, you can't stay over here anymore. It'll become a huge issue. Arun, did handle it smoothly. If I leave now, they might suspect. Karthik, it'll be risky-- Pallavi, calm down. Karthik, you're my childhood friend. I'll handle it, okay. Okay, then do one thing. Promise me. They should never know your purpose of visit. Hey, come on, don't make me promise for silly things. Just do what I say. Promise! Promise. Karthik, this is a huge mall. I think, it'll take a month for me to just take a look around. Yes sir. You must've visited this place a lot. -No, this is my-- -Hey Sumithra, how are you? Yeah, fine. Dad, this is my friend Sumithra. Uncle, Greetings. Oh, greetings, dear. Despite settled abroad, she hasn't forgotten our culture. Mummy! I don't get it. Why is her son calling that lady, mom? Dad, it's nothing but... first Sumithra and Rajesh were married. Then it was Jenny and Michael. But now it's Sumithra and Michael. Jenny and Rajesh. Uncle, it's confusing like watching Avengers Endgame without subtitles. I understood. -Please explain. -I'll explain with subtitles. Move! Now, you're watching spouse connections. Season One: Episode one. Sumithra-Rajesh to my left. Jenny-Michael to my right. It so happened, Sumithra and Rajesh fell in love and got married. Uh... whereas Jenny and Michael... poor thing, they got married due to family pressure. She couldn't handle her father's pressure. Episode Two. A child was born to Sumithra-Rajesh. That is production number one. Such was the case with Jenny-Michael. Production number one. Episode Three: The Twist. Only after the first child, Rajesh and Jenny's affair came to light. It was a shattering news. Action sequence. As a result... Rajesh marries Jenny, Sumithra marries Michael. Shift! Oh, damn! These new couples had their own children. Pallavi, please bring the latest production. It is now a happy family. Boys and girls. This is Season Two's trailer. This can be the future. What the hell is all this? Uncle, when will our country progress like this? Hey, stop being silly. Hey, what happened to him? Multiple parent disorder. Phew! Sir, please pace yourself. Why do you care about their dysfunctional family? It's not about them. Looking at them, I personally feel guilty. Did something similar happen in your life too-- No, no, nothing like that. Don't take me wrong. Do you remember, Selvam? Selvam... Your friend back in Chennai. His daughter was in love with a man... Exactly, you're right. His daughter was in love with a guy. He didn't accept their love and got her married to someone else. Ten days into the marriage she committed suicide. Oh, no! That's right he made a mistake. She would've been alive today, if he had got her married to her lover. Forget about it. You couldn't done anything about it. Obviously, it was their family matter. What if that same incident happens in my family? I don't get it, uncle. It's not much though. Pallavi was in love with someone before she got married. What makes you sure of it? I know... I can't bear it. Don't! [sobbing] -Nisha! -Tell me, uncle. Is your friend not interested in this marriage? By any chance, is she in love with someone? Who is it? Uncle, it doesn't matter anymore. As if you're going to call off the wedding. It's too late. Things will fall in place after the marriage. Let's finish what we started. -I'm leaving. -Listen... That's when I knew. Since I heard that Selvam's daughter committed suicide... I've lost sleep. At present, Pallavi is in the same state. I don't know what's running on her mind. Is she happy with her life? These thoughts are troubling me. That's why I came over right away. Look, you're a good friend of Arun. Also, you're a well-wisher of our family. Do you think, Pallavi and Arun are happy in their marriage? I don't know how to put it across. Hey, Super. Stop kidding around get to the point. One heart. One bedroom. It's important that we hear the voice from our heart. What happens inside the bedroom will reflect in life too. So, what's happening inside the bedroom? Nothing is happening. Hey, how do you know about that? There are three bedrooms in the house. Arun should be sleeping with Pallavi. He doesn't, instead he's sleeping with me in my bedroom. I don't know exactly what's the problem. Are you really serious? Why don't you check for yourself tonight? Live telecast. Uncle, get back here. Wait! [clears throat] Dad, why aren't you asleep? -Why haven't you slept? -I will once I'm done here. You please go ahead and sleep. Okay, let's go. Karthik, aren't you coming to bed? What the hell is happening? Uncle, how come two men are sharing the same room? Don't give me that look. I'm not what you think of me. Disgusting fellow, let's go. -Pallavi. -What is it, dad? I've got toothache. Tell me. I've got a toothache. How many times will you cal my name? Speak, damn it. Uncle is suffering from toothache. You got toothache? Is it hurting too much? Shall I take off from work? Not a big deal. It's just toothache. We'll take superpower along. He'll drive us to the clinic. Okay, please have breakfast. I'll check up on you later. Call me if you need anything. Uncle has toothache, so he can't eat. But I can. Eating is all you know. Call him. Hey, super! How come you got toothache? It's all a ruse. It's an act to meet Nisha. -An act for what? -That's right. To find out who is Pallavi's ex-lover. Uncle, he's going to wreck our teeth and take us to the dentist. Sorry, I thought something crossed the road. What are you going to do, if you knew who is Pallavi's ex-lover? Will get them married. What? He's right. That one bedroom, one heart philosophy... that's the truth and the reality. Thank god, you didn't mention anything about bathroom. He's incorrigible. Karthik, I've been noticing things at home. I have thought this through. It's better I get her re-married to the person she's in love with. But this can't be done in haste. Because, three lives are involved in this matter. Moreover, I have no idea, where's that guy and what he's doing? I'm not even sure, if he still remembers, Pallavi. Obviously, he wouldn't have forgotten her. First love. First touch. First kiss. It's really hard to forget them. We'd rather discuss this with Nisha. Sir, please don't take me wrong. Nisha is a college nerd. It's not easy to crack her. Shake her down to spill the beans. You want us to shake down Nisha? If we have to shake her down... we'll need supplements to gain strength. Don't you dare speak about other people appearances. -Karthik, please drive. -Okay, sir. When does your VISA expire sir? You came travelling thousands of kilometres. Please ask all you wanted to. -Is this the clinic? -Yes, right here. -You stay right here. -Okay, sir. Take your time. Finally, things are looking my way. I just want you to open your mouth a little bit more. Let me take a closer look at what's happening out here. -Nisha. -Uncle! Tell me, uncle. Pallavi said you'll be coming over. But she wouldn't have mentioned, why? No. She didn't mention. Start the vehicle. Uncle, did you speak to Nisha? What did she say? -Yes, she spoke. -Huh! Finally! It's pissing me off. Uncle, forget it. Let's mutually sort it out. What the hell do you want me to sort? The guy's name is Valayapathi. He hails from Vathalagundu. He works at Electricity Board. Who's Valayapathi? From Vathalagundu? That's right. Pallavi met him on a field trip. Bloody rascal, he got married way before Pallavi did. Moreover, he's a father of two children. Uncle, shall I cross check if the information is correct? Really? Why don't we hand over the case to CBI? We're really pissed. It's better you drive us home. Only If I take a cold shower, I'll cool down. -Such an irritating name. -Come on, let's go. Thank god, he wasn't named Kundalakesi. Pallavi, I was shocked. I somehow managed the situation. But your father thinks that you and Arun are not happy. I think that prude is poisoning your dad's thoughts. Be careful. Hey, Nisha, I'll call you back. Hey, she's out here. I hope your toothache is fine now. What exactly do you want, dad? You could've asked me straight away. It's not that, dear. Arun and I are leading an understanding and peaceful life. We have no issues at all. Don't believe everything people say. You've always done right by me. You may have not given me what I liked.. ...but you always knew what suits me. Don't confuse yourself with unnecessary thoughts. I want you to be always happy. That's my only worry. If you're happy, I have no qualms. I'm not sure what is happiness according to your generation. But our generation find joy in their children's happiness. I want you to be happy. Karthik. I thought you've changed. But that seems impossible. -Pallavi, please hear me out. -Enough! My mom, dad and Arun. They're my world. This is my house. That's reality. It will never change. Neither anyone can dare change it. Pallavi! Please serve it to Arun. Father-in-law you look very fresh today. Anything special? Nothing much, Arun. If your heart is not in a confused state... your mind stays fresh. Come on, everyone eat well. Hey, what's wrong with you superpower? You're just filling up on jam. I was starting my meal with something sweet. Sounds great, carry on. Arun, since dad got here, we never hung out. So, let's take a day off. Let's all go somewhere fun. Pallavi, tomorrow I have to go to Monaco. It's a business trip. Uh... why don't you take them around? No way. You're headed Monaco, right? It's a beautiful place. Let's all go together. Pallavi, please understand I have a client meeting. How can I take you there? You don't worry about it. We'll handle it. Dear, I think he's busy. Don't bother him. It's okay, dad. He always makes an excuse. Meetings is all he talks about. Let's turn this meeting into an outing. What do you say, Arun? Please. Yeah, okay. We'll go. So, everything is sorted. -Hey, superpower. -Sir! Why don't you join us? I don't think so. You guys are the world-- You guys are going as a family. Why do you need me there? You guys have a fun trip. Come on, you're part of our family too. Don't speak like an outsider. He's scared of being alone. Why don't you join us? He agreed. -Okay, sir. -That's great. Father-in-law, let's freshen up and leave. Okay, Arun. We've booked three rooms. 301, 304, 305. Father-in-law, I've booked three rooms. Pallavi and I are staying in one room. You and brother stay in another. Karthik, I've got you a separate room. Why do we need three rooms? Two rooms are enough. Karthik can stay in our room. If required add an extra bed. Extra bed? With you guys? -Yes. -Extra bed is not required. An extra pillow is more than enough. Two rooms. -These are your keys. -Uncle snores a lot. You gotta adjust. -Hey, let's go. -This way. Come on, hold this. Uncle, take a selfie. I don't know how to take a selfie. Karthik, come on help us out. -Come on. -Super, make sure it's a good click. Come on. -Come closer. -Smile, damn it. Look, Pallavi and Arun look so happy in love. I was wrong about them. I'm getting old. So, my mind is playing tricks. You're right. Superpower, when are you getting married? I'll get married when I meet a girl. If I had another daughter, I would've got her married to you. When you could've, you didn't. -What is it? -Nothing, sir. Why do you look so annoyed? Go and have some juice. My bladder is full 'cause of cold. Come on, let's look for restroom. Samadhi, I wonder who is it? Hello, who is speaking? Who the hell are you? Doesn't matter. You called me. Tell me. -Is there no one around? -There are people. Who are you just blaberring? There are many hot chicks around. What do you want? Hey, this is Arun's father speaking. Oh, no! He saved the wrong spelling, damn it. Hello. Wrong number. Sorry, wrong receiver. The person you're trying to speak is nearby. One minute. Sir, Samadhi is calling. -Who? -Your Samadhi, sorry I meant your kinsmen. -Oh! -Escape... Hello sir, how are you? I'm good. Who was on the phone earlier? Who are you talking about? Oh, that guy, it's Karthik. He's Arun's school friend. I've never heard of him. -That's what Arun said. -Really? Can you send a picture of him? Sure. -There's Karthik's selfie on the phone. -Yes. -Send that to kinsmen. -Sure, I will send it. I haven't seen this face in my life. Something's wrong, it's better you check what's happening. So, how are Arun and Pallavi? They're doing well. -I'll call you back later.-Ok sure. What would've gone wrong? Hey, call Nisha. Hello. Tell me, uncle. Nisha, stop fooling around. Tell me the truth. Why is Karthik staying at Pallavi's house? -Oh, no, uncle! -Tell me. I have nothing to do with it. What do you mean by it? It's like... oh, no... I did warn Pallavi about it. What did you warn her about? Not to do this. Speak clearly, damn it. I told not to let her ex-lover to stay with them. Karthik was Pallavi's lover. That's a great twist. Hey, Pallavi. What's up? -It's too good. -Nice. -Enjoying? -Yeah. Can you play? -Yeah, I can also play. -Really? I have a meeting, I'll be back soon. -Okay, come soon. -I'll be back soon. Bye. [inaudible] Did you finish your meeting? Yeah, done. So, project has been approved? Almost. So, from the past one year you've been working on this project? Pardon? Did you meet the clients at the coffee shop... or it happened in the parking lot? Pallavi, what are you trying to say? Do you really don't understand or pretending not to? I saw everything, Arun. -Don't try and fool me. -I think something's wrong. -Are they fighting? -What are you saying? I don't understand. Are you okay, Pallavi? No, I'm not. I saw you talking to that women at the parking lot. -Pallavi! -Arun, that's enough. Stop lying. You're lying through your teeth. I trusted you. I've shared everything that happened in my life. I shared everything about my love and Karthik. More than my better half, I thought you're my best friend. -Lis-- listen to me. -No! I gave up my love to be with you. Pallavi, Pallavi, calm down. Just hear me out for a second, please. I trusted you with my heart, Arun. I thought you were my world. I threw away my love for your sake. Who's that woman? I want to know, right now. Tell me, Arun. Who is that woman? I'm asking you, damn it. Come on, tell me. [sobbing] Why did you ask me to come? I felt like talking to you. That's why I called you. There's another woman in Arun's life. I saw them myself. I couldn't believe it. He came down just to meet her. I thought he was my world. But... I never ever thought his world was someone else. I don't know what to do. I don't know who I should speak to. Why are you telling me this? Things which hurt you the most... are shared with the near and dear ones. That's why I'm telling you. "You may be an obliterated painting" "but your touch can't be forgotten" "You're like a drenched stream" "but your sorrows don't wash away." "These relationships don't die but remain as a light inside the heart." "This has been an unanswered question in the journey of an human life." Show the Scorching star to the bride. Over there! There's nothing in the sky. Sir, it's just a ritual. It's a belief. If you do it, then you'll lead a happy life. Just a ritual. Apologies. Even as a ritual I don't want to lie to Pallavi. "'Oh dear, will you come along with me?" "Will you disappear with me into oblivion?" "You may be an obliterated painting" "but your touch can't be forgotten" "You're like a drenched stream" "but your sorrows don't wash away." "When you're on the swing, our eyes slam with each other" "But when you dance, all eyes are you on you." "The days we lived together, weren't enough to savor" "It's not fair that you want to live apart now." "'Oh' dear, will you come along with me?" "Will you disappear with me..." "...into oblivion?" I've met the guy. Who are you talking about? Pallavi's ex-lover. When and where did you meet him? A year ago... he used to be our tenant. When he was vacating the house... he said one thing, The things we look for will be right in front of our eyes. But to attain them, we'll have to take a long path. Back then, I didn't get it. But now I get it. We took a way longer path. It's high time we stop lying to each other. More than Pallavi being Pallavi Arun... I believe her being Pallavi Karthik will make her more happy. No, sir. Are you waiting for someone? Girlfriend? I heard you were hugging her in the parking lot. Or you got another girlfriend? Is she beautiful than Pallavi? Just shut up. Am I making you angry? If a guy who cheats on his wife can get angry... just imagine how angry Pallavi must be, who thinks of you as her world. Your father thinks you're the most honest person in the world. What do you have to say to him? What are you going to say? All of this is making me angry too. You don't deserve to get angry. I thought even god can't separate you guys. But you've done it yourself. What did I do? Huh? What did I do? Tell me. You don't know anything about me. I grew up all alone. I used to be scared to even talk to others. I had no friends. I was living inside a bubble. The first person to burst that bubble was Caroline. Caroline and I were in the same college. She was very outspoken. But I was opposite. But that's what she liked. Just when I thought I got a great friend... she proposed her love to me. That was shocking to me. 'Cause I never thought of her like that. [music mutes voices] I was clueless in how to handle that situation. With no choice left, I started avoiding her. But she never let go of me. I tried making her understand, that I always looked at her as my friend. When she knew I got married, she went into depression. She tried to kill herself with drugs. I felt guilty to put her in this state. She became a drug addict. Caroline. Caroline! Look at me. Can you hear me? Look at me. I couldn't bear it. I never loved her. But I want her to have a good life. Hey, do you think any husband will allow his wife's ex-lover to stay with them? Do you know why I agreed to it? Because I saw Caroline in your eyes. I saw myself in Pallavi's good intentions to make your life better. Got it? Why didn't you tell this to, Pallavi? She's not in a state to listen. She's crying, thinking I cheated on her. I can't bear that. If I lose Pallavi, I have nothing. I'll die. Why didn't you mention this to me earlier? Come on, let's speak to Pallavi. We're no one to interfere in their matters. Hey! What are you saying? Do you know exactly who creates problems in a family? It's the third person who enters to solve the problem. Let's not make that mistake. Let's wait for Arun, dear. Come on, Arun, let's eat. It's fine, you carry on. I'll have dinner outside. What happened, dear? He was complaining about headache. That must be it. What is the name of his headache? Is it, Pallavi? Dad? I know what's happening in the house. I don't want to beat around the bush. You never mentioned anything before your marriage. Now that I know everything, I wanna talk to you. How long are you planning to hang on to a husband who doesn't care? It's not too late. You divorce Arun. And get married to Karthik. What do you say, Karthik? Dad! Sir, I'm totally fine with it. -You're saying the right thing. -Karthik! Pallavi, Arun neither cares or loves you. I've been staying here for very long... has he ever questioned you suspecting our integrity? If he was really a caring husband... he should've thrown me out. Think about it... I don't know why am I explaining myself. Sir, if she's okay. I'm okay too. Pallavi. What about you? Thanks, Karthik. Arun, where are you going? I going away from you. Pallavi-- Pallavi, stop it. Pallavi, stop what-- Pallavi! Pa-- Pallavi, stop it. When you've decided to leave me... Why do you need this? Arun. Don't I have the right to question you? Just 'cause I asked you about your relationship with that girl... ...you stopped talking to me. I was scared that no one should take my place in your heart. I was really scared. That's why I yelled at you. So, you see my anger just as it is. Why can't you see my love behind the anger? Fine. I don't care about the others. I want to know. What I saw the other day, is that true? Is there someone else between us? No. There's no one but you in my life. Hope you won't leave me. Did you see that? That's life. Not every love story leads to a wedding. It's not imperative that every marriage should begin with love. Marriage is a long journey. More than loving each other... if you trust each other, it's more than enough. Karthik. I wasn't able to support your love... but I respect it. You have a golden heart. I don't think so. Even if the life they loved to lead didn't work out... they cared about their loved ones, Arun and Pallavi have a greater heart. I'm nothing compared to them. I thought my life belonged to Pallavi. But later I realized my life belongs to me. Life always gives you a second chance. There's just one way to enter... but there are many exits to choose. Karthik, where are you going? I understood everything we spoke now. But the old Karthik is refusing to comprehend. If I cry my heart out. I'll be fine.
