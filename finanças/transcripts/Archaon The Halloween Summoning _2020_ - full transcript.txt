Dude, you got it. Yeah, it got here fast. You ordered that when, it was like Saturday? Yeah, something like that. Oh my God. I can't believe you bought this. Dude, relax. Just a fairytale. Let's check this out. Whoa. Wait, what is this? I don't know, let me see. Who knows. You're crazy, man. Hey. What are you nerds doing? I just saw the deliveryman leave, what did you buy with mom's- I didn't buy anything with mom... What the hell is this? Please be careful with that. Why can't you nerds go to a store and buy a mask like regular people? You don't know what you're talking about. They use this mask in some of the first Sauin festivals. I don't know what that means. Halloween originated with the Celts. They used masks like these to ward off evil spirits. Yeah, with that smell, you'd ward off everything. Yeah, whatever, man. This thing's awesome. They say that druids used these things to trap people's spirits during their rituals and ceremonies. Not only that, during their New Year, which is now Halloween. Oh! Some scary stuff. I really hope you didn't pay extra for that. I'm outta here. Do me a favor, don't jerk each other off when I'm gone. What a douche. Anyway, let's just mess with the mask later. We're supposed to meet up with Kate and Theresa at the brewery. Let's just go. Yeah. So, when do your parents get back from Europe? Uh, like a week or so. Throwing a little party or what? No, I can't. You know how Jackson is. That little prick will tell my parents. That's why we need our own place, man. Yeah? And how would we pay for that? All you do is fish all day, and you're not even good at it. Hey, man. I've caught more fish in this lake than you have. That's not saying much. Ooh! Damn it. You robbed me, man. Sucks. Oh, whoa, wait, wait, wait. Fish on, fish on! You kiddin' me? What did I tell you, dude? You just gotta be patient. Flynn! Flynn! Hey, don't let him eat that, he's vegan. What? Flynn, don't run off like that, you scared me. Nolan Miller. Last time I talked to you, you stood me up on that date. Sara, I can explain that. Save it. Thanks for saving Flynn. Well hey, hey. What if I made it up to you? Why don't we go out tonight? Any restaurant that you want. My favorite restaurant? Yeah, whatever. All right, deal. Um, how does 8 sound? Can I pick you up? Sounds good. You've had a crush on her since the 2nd grade. Yeah. And she's still single. What happened to you on the last date, man? How did you bail on her, dude? That was a day that you convinced me that you could smoke a whole blunt in less that five minutes. Yeah, and decided to drink a whole thing of laundry detergent. Yeah. And I sat at the hospital all day while you got your stomach pumped. Nolan. I was a dying man. I would've done the same for you! Yeah, next time you have an idea like that, you're on your own. I'm so excited for your party, Jackson. Yeah, it should be fun. Thank you. Thank you. So, what are you guys going as? You'll have to wait and see. What are you wearing, Jackson? I've got this really cool- You'll have to wait and see too. Just don't tell anyone yet, I haven't told my brother, so. Dude, I thought you already got that cleared up. He's not gonna care. What? I already told all my friends, so you better get it figured out. Yeah, yeah, we got it. No worries. We'll be right back. Come on, Kate, we need to use the restroom. We do? Come on. Oh, right. Don't ruin this for me, man. I've been after Theresa for months. Dude, quit worrying. You're a shoe in. So you like Jackson, huh? Yes, is it that obvious? Yeah, it's pretty obvious. Okay, well, do you think he likes me too? I feel like he does. Yeah, he likes you. Yeah, well you need to nut up and just talk to your brother. I will. I'll talk to him tonight. You're being a pansy, dude. Just let me talk to him. I got it. Okay, you better. Well, Pete definitely likes you. Gross. No, we could have cute little double dates. No, no- Like this? He's creepy, he's gross. I don't wanna. He's not... Yeah. Theresa and I are getting down at the party, you've got to let me use your bedroom. Dude, that's gross. Use Nolan's. I'll take whatever I can get. So, this is your favorite restaurant? Yeah. The steak is really good here. I thought you were vegan. No, just Flynn, my dog. You have no idea what they put in that dog food. Oh, that's cool. You look really pretty, by the way. Thank you. You're very pretty too. Hey guys, how you doin' tonight. Good. Good. Good. We have some great wine tonight, a vintage Merlot if you're interested. Um, yeah. How's your Cabernet? The Cabernet Sauvignon? It's a very bold wine. It's a firm, firm wine. Okay. Maybe if- While I do love a good Cabernet, I think we'll go with the Pinot Noir. Sure. It'll pair well with the rib-eye. Great choice. Medium, please. Absolutely. And for you? I'll have what she's having. Excellent. Thanks for saving me back there. I don't drink a lot of wine. I could tell. So, you're still living with your parents? Yeah. But my buddy Hunter and I, we're actually trying to get our own place. Just I'm the only one with a consistent job, so it's gonna be a minute. I hear that. I just moved into my place on the east side. My parents acted so sad when I left, but I could tell those were secretly tears of pure joy. That's awesome. Did you ever finish nursing school? Yeah, I just got my BSN. I'm supposed to start working at the hospital downtown in a couple weeks. Oh, nice. So, you're just taking it easy until then? We have 12 hour shifts, so I'm trying to get as much sleep as I can. Enjoy, guys. Thank you. Thanks. I wanted to apologize for bailing on you last time. I'm really glad that you gave me a second chance. It's okay. I'm glad I did too. To a fresh start. What are you doing after this? If you're not doing anything, you should come back to my place. I rented "Rise of the Dead". It actually just came out. Really? Yeah. I've actually wanted to see that. It sounds great. A fresh start and an encore all in one evening. I love it. This is it. Make yourself comfortable. I'm gonna start some popcorn. Hey, do you want butter or no butter? Butter, please. So, I don't know a lot about wine, but I do know a little bit about beer. You want one? Sure. You like it? It's delicious. I thought we were watching a movie. Yes, we are. Um, popcorn. We should've done this a lot sooner. I was thinking the same thing. Hey, Nolan, I need to talk to you for a second. I'm in the middle of a movie, bro. Can we talk about this later? Yeah. Hello? Hey, did you talk to him yet? No, not yet. I literally just got home, and he's got a girl over. I'm coming over. No, wait. I'll talk to him, all right? Nope, on the way. No... Damn it, Pete. What? I just can't get over why we never started hanging out after college. We tried, remember? Nolan? Dude. What's wrong? Hey, did you fall? There's something in the mask. What's in the mask? It's in the mask. What's in the mask? I don't know, I saw. Hey. You're not making any sense. I saw something in there. What? No, don't leave. Sara's gonna stay with you. I'll be right back. Hey, what's going on, man? I thought you had a girl over. Pete, what are you doing here? Whoa. Jackson. You look like you've seen a ghost. Here you go. It's still really hot, but it'll make you feel better. Okay, so, let's go back to the beginning. You put the mask on, then what happened? You said you saw something. You're not gonna believe me. Come on, man. I put the mask on. I mean I was still in my bedroom, but it was strange. All the furniture was gone and there were vines hanging from the ceiling, and it was cold and it was dark. I told you, man. I told you- Hey, hey. To not put the mask on. Hang on, Pete. Let him finish. Okay, so I followed the shadow into the bathroom, and I swear, I swear I saw something in the shower. But as soon as I looked inside, there was nothing there. So then you didn't see anything. No, that's where I saw it. What did you see? It was the scariest thing I've seen in my entire life. And I took the mask off and everything went back to normal like nothing ever happened. Well then, there's only one thing I can do. I gotta put the mask on. No, please, don't do that. I warned you, man. I warned you not to put it on. Pete, hey! I'll grab it. Oh my God, that's terrifying. It's just a mask, guys. Jackson, you're always doing this stuff, making up ghost stories just to get a reaction. Put it on then. Fine. What's going on, guys? Nolan? See? What'd I tell you? I told Jackson this was a bad idea, and now you know too. All this stuff comes with a price, and we don't know what we just paid. Where did you get this? Let's just send it back! The return address, there might be one on the box. Where's it from? There's no return address. Hey. Where did you buy it? Get off me. What program is that? It's IP Ghost. It hides my IP address so it can't be tracked. This is an IP scrambler called "Now You See Me". Basically, it just pings my location across the world, so if anyone's tracking us, IP Ghost goes to work, hides our location. Now you see me, now you don't. Government? What was that about the government? Don't worry about that part. Probably shouldn't tell him about the FBI letters then, huh? Shut up, Pete. He's kidding, by the way. All right, we're in. Okay, so what is this? What are we looking at? Explain it. This is the Dark Web. I'm pulling up the site where I bought the mask now. What does that mean? The site crashed. Well, why don't we do a search to figure out how to destroy this thing? We don't what this is, Pete. Well, we know enough. Just search druid, mask, and demon. This is interesting. There. That looks good. Druid, mask, and the demon within. That's what I saw. Well, how the hell do we get rid of this thing? Okay. "Typically destroyed by ceremonial fire or burial." Now we're getting somewhere. Can you make that bigger? What's that? What's happening? IP address failed, we're being tracked. Well, turn it off, man! I'm locked out, it's not responding. We have 5 'til- 5 til' what? Shut up, keep going. 4 'til. 3 'til. 2 'til. I got it, I got it, I got it! What does that mean? It means somebody knows what we're looking at. All right. I'm done with this. Sara, grab the matches, right by the sink. It's done. Hey Jackson, grab the blankets. I think it's best if we all stay down here tonight. It's getting late. Sara, Pete, you can stay if you want. Yeah, I'm not going anywhere. I mean, you can bunk with me if you want. Hey Pete, you can sleep outside if you want. I'm good. And Jackson, you want the couch? I'm good. You guys go for it. Sara, you want it? I want to sleep next to you. Okay. I'll take the couch. You good? Want some water? Yeah, that would be great. Thanks. Mhm. This isn't how I wanted the night to go. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm just glad I'm with you. Jackson. Jackson. Jackson. Jackson. Don't deny it, Jackson. Jackson! What is it? Where'd the mask come from? It was back in the box. What the hell? We burned it. There's not even a char mark on it. Didn't that Dark Web article say to burn it or bury it? Yeah, that's right. The question is, where? As far away from here as possible. So you really think this is gonna work? Burying it? I don't know. But it's the only thing we can do at this point. What did you see in there when you disappeared? Just as Jackson said. It was the same place, just overgrown. It felt dead and cold. I think that thing was in there with me. I don't know, this is all sorts of messed up. If there is a God, he's not in that place. Kinda makes me want to see what you guys saw. No, you don't. Trust me. Bury it. Should be gone for good now. How do you know? I mean, we burned it. Well, this is the only other thing we dug up in our research. No pun intended. That should hold her. It's been a long day. Let's get out of here. Come on, man. We still need to see if your brother will let us throw the party. Dude. I'm starving. Uh, guys? The party. What party? We forgot to tell you. Jackson's throwing a party tonight. No, he's not. It's not gonna happen. Obviously we have to deal with this. Maybe it would be good for us. Take our minds off this. Hide it upstairs. And they better have brought their own alcohol, 'cause you're not touching mine. Hey. Hey, took you long enough. I thought you bailed on us. Where's your costume? I thought you had something special. I did, it just didn't work out. That's okay. Come on in. Damn, girl. You look great. Can you put this in the freezer? Yeah. You guys wanna go take a shot?

Fire! There's a fire! Get out! There's a fire everybody! You gotta be kidding me. Hey, girls, party's over. You're gonna have to leave. Come on, man! Now. I'm sorry, Kate, but you heard my brother. It's okay, we're leaving. Come on, Theresa. I'm sorry. I'll see you around. What is this thing? I don't know. But it's evil. But the mask came with a piece of paper. Jackson, do you remember where it is? It should be under the bed. I'm starting to think this thing is a warning of some sort. That's exactly what it is. Party's over, man. If I were here for a party, who would've dressed up? You're gonna have to leave. You don't understand, I'm here to help. In your possession is a mask from the 1400s. It is the only such artifact to survive from the time. Have any of you put on the mask? I have and he has. Follow me then. Oh, and I'd stop holding it. The longer you're around it, the more it will call to you. I think he can help us. My name is James Kirkland, and I'm part of an organization that handles and oversees artifacts such as these. I've been tracking the mask for several years now. Have a seat, Mr. Miller. Please, make yourselves comfortable. It's best I start from the beginning. I followed the package you purchased on October 26th. So you're the one who tracked our IP address. Well, I was trying to protect you. We're dealing with a very powerful entity who I believe is called Archeon. The son of the Devil? Yes, that's right. There was a warning note written in Gaelic that came with the package. Do you still have it? Is this it? This note describes the intended use of the mask. It was once used in some of the first Sauin festivals by the Celts. Yeah. Tell us something we don't know. Patience, friend. You know nothing. I'm assuming since you two put on the mask, you've been transported to what we call the inbetween. Your faces reveal the truth. This is not to be taken lightly. By putting on the mask, you've invited a non-worldly presence into your home. The vessel is not only a portal to the inbetween, but also a door, if you will. One that has been opened and was meant to stay shut. What are you saying? I'm saying that the mask was used in rituals to trap demons and you've let one into your home. Take it then. We don't want it. It's not that easy. The demon has attached itself to your home and your family. Well, we've tried to burn it and bury it. How do we get rid of it? The festival channels the demon's power. During the era that this mask was used, fire played a large part in the Sauin festivals. Did you speak the sacred texts when you burned it? No. No. Then you've only added to the demon's power. What is the Sauin festival? It's what you call Halloween, only it was celebrated on the last day of the Celtic harvest, November 1st. The first day of their New Year. The Celts wore the masks in their ritual ceremonies to ward off evil spirits. In this particular case, the mask was used to harness the demon's power, to be used by the wearer. What they didn't realize was that the spirit was far more powerful than they imagined, which resulted them having to trap the demon in the vessel. The mask was hidden for centuries, until now. So, can we destroy this mask or not? First we need to trap the demon back in the vessel, and then the vessel can be destroyed. Now that it's out, how do we get it back in? Well, that is the hard part. The demon wants to be free. It won't go back in easy now that the Sauin festival has begun. We're going to have to work together to lure it back in. I hate to tell you, but, we're going to need one of you as bait. I'll do it. No, it has to be one of them. Whoever wore it first. It was me. I got us into this mess, so, I feel I can get us out. Plus it already knows my name. What? I saw it during the party. Well, we need to move fast then. From now on, if you hear something, if you see something, you let everyone know. Grab some rope. You two, we need every mirror you can find. Jackson, we'll need some salt, and lots of it. Okay. This will do. Hold on. Let's get the ones in my parents' bedroom. Sounds good. What are those? These are ancient Babylonian terracotta bowls. They have spells written on them that will keep the demon within a certain boundary. Bury these face down at the four corners of the house. Cool. Find some candles? Candles. Got it. And a bucket of water. What's on your mind? What? Look, I know you're scared. But let me assure you, I've been doing this a long time, and I haven't lost anyone yet. All right? It's not that. I mean, not really anyways. I just don't want anyone else getting hurt from me. Here. Take this. It's a Celtic dagger. It has some of the same power as that in the mask. If you ever find yourself in danger, it will protect you. Thanks. You're gonna do great. Just don't cut yourself. I'll do what I can. Will this work? I don't know, just grab it. Hey. You okay? This is all just crazy. I feel like I'm in a dream and I'm just gonna wake up and this will all be over, but I know that I'm not. Hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna get us outta this. We're gonna be fine, you hear me? It's not though. I'm scared. I'm scared too, but we have a plan and it's going to work. Now let's get that last mirror, get downstairs, and finish this. This looks good. All right, let's start putting this together. You two, let's put the bowls outside. Go ahead and start setting up the mirrors in your bedroom, Jackson. My mom's gonna hate us digging in her bushes. I think we have more important things to worry about. Is that deep enough? Make sure it's face down. Now bury it. All right, next spot. All right. Let's finish the front before you hit the back. That's what she said. Damn it, Pete! I thought it was good. I thought it was good. Does that work? Yeah, I think so. So, Kate, right? What's the deal with her? She's a good friend. So, just a friend then? Well, I mean, more than a friend, but I don't know. I know her sister. She talks about her a lot. I'm sorry. What? I'm so sorry I got you involved in this. I chose to be here. I'm not being held hostage or anything, right? So, why'd you buy the mask anyway? I don't know. I guess I just thought it would be cool. I get it. It is pretty terrifying. What's it like? You feel your soul being ripped from your body, and you know you're gonna die, and there's nothing you can do about it. When I saw it I took the mask off, I guess that's when you guys heard me screaming and came upstairs, but I don't remember screaming. I should've just listened to Pete. He told me not to buy the mask, and he's right. Everything comes with a price. I'm gonna go grab some water. Want anything? I'm good, thank you. And that's the only situation when you'd ever want to put your hand in a blender. Now, I wouldn't do it either way, but under those circumstances, what choice would you have? Hey, man. Do you ever shut the hell up? I wasn't even talking to you! What? Where's Sara? I don't know. Sara. I put on the mask. What? Why? Why would you do that? I don't know, it was calling me! The demon's power is growing. We need to move quickly. Did it touch you? No, no he didn't touch me. All right, everyone, we need to stay together. And give me the mask, I need to check your work. What happened in there? Jackson and I know, you can tell us. I was looking around the house when I saw it. Him. I hid in the kitchen, but it knew where I was. You can't go back in there. We have to. No, you can't! That thing, it's evil, pure evil. This is why we're doing this. So no one else has to go through what we did. Good work with the mirrors. I just have the rope left. How do we know we can trust this guy? We can't. What else are we gonna do? It's the only option that we have. Right. Plus, he seems like he knows what he's doing. So, we're just gonna take his word on it? We're not gonna call the church or something? We need an exorcist, not an archeologist. I know you're scared, we all are. But we're gonna stick together and we're gonna get through this. All right? Are you all right, man? Yeah. I'm just thinking. How did he know about the warning label? It's time. Something about this isn't right. What do you want me to do about it, Pete? I don't know. Maybe Sara's right, we shouldn't trust him. This isn't going to end well. Get your head in the game. All right. I've protected the house. The candles will let us know if the demon is close. Jackson, you're the bait. You'll be upstairs in the circle of mirrors in your bedroom. The demon wants your soul, Jackson. He'll try and take it from you, but you can fight it, okay? Now, we're going to need somebody to stay behind. For this to work, we'll need to be physically tethered to the real world so that all of us can be in the inbetween at the same time. I think you should stay. No, I want to go with you. It's gonna be safer this way. I'm gonna be all right. Jackson, you'll tie this end around your waist. Sara, you'll take the other end. Once you're in the mirror room, Nolan, Pete, and I will guide the demon to you. The mirrors will freeze the demon in place. Once the demon is stuck there that should give us enough time to get out and destroy the vessel. Sara, now this is important. Now, you'll have your candle. Once the flame goes out you'll know that the demon is close. I want you to let us know. Give us three strong tugs on the rope, and that'll be the signal for us to get in place. Can you do that? Good. Any questions? How do we lure the demon in? Have you ever played hide and seek? Yeah. It'll be a lot like that. Damn it. All right. I think we're ready. You better come back. We will, don't worry. Go ahead. I'll see you guys on the other side. Now what? Now we wait. Dude. You're seriously freaking me out with that thing. Shut up. We need to wait for the signal. It's gonna be all right. Wait, I thought I was supposed to give the signal. What's going on? Is that you guys? Guys, this isn't funny! Take off the mask, we need to get back. Sara's in trouble. No. We stick to the plan. Take off the mask. She'll be fine. The demon wants Jackson. That was the signal though. Jackson, we need to get you in position. Jackson. He's in position. It's time to lure the demon in. How exactly are we gonna do that? Nolan, hand me the salt. Jackson. Now, when the demon comes in after us, this is where he'll be confined. Grab that pail. When he shows up, I need you to break the circle with the water. That will keep him trapped in the inbetween. And that will release him from the circle. When he gets out, he's going to come for you. I need you to wait by the stairs and lead him up to Jackson's room. Are we good? What about you? Don't worry about me. Just get ready. Pete! The water, do it now! Nolan! No, no, no, Jackson! Jackson! The demon didn't even notice Kirkland. What are you talking about? I know what I saw. You didn't notice because you were running upstairs. Get inside the circle! The demon can't break the circle. Pete, get inside the circle, it's the only form of protection we have! Don't mess around, man! Pete, come on! Come on, Pete! It's taking him! Come on! All right, we don't have much time. We need to destroy the vessel before the demon escapes the inbetween. Come with me. Hey, keep going, I got her. Keep going. Hey, Sara, Sara, Sara. Sara, wake up. Come on. Hey, hey. You're okay. You okay? Is it done then? It's done. Hey. Thanks for everything. I'm really glad you showed up when you did. I'm just happy to help. I really hope this is over. What do you mean? I don't know, man. I know what I saw, and I don't think Kirkland is who he says he is. We saw a lot of things. Things we'll never forget, but look. We're all still here. The mask is gone, it's over. Okay? I hope you're right. You ready? Yeah. Jackson. Don't go buying anymore masks. I won't. Take care of yourselves. I hope to never see you again. I'm hungry. Let's see what we have in the fridge. So... That make up for ditching you on that date? I don't know, you might have to try making it up to me again. Is that right? Mhm. I'm sure I can think of something. Get a room! There you guys go, jerking each other off again. It's done. Good. This is the last one I'm doing for you. We'll see.
