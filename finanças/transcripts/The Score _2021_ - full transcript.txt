Where was it? Oh, Christ. It's not like it's still hidden. You're as bad as your brother. - It's needs to know. - Twat. You're a mess. Never said it was formal. Just don't soil the leather, yeah? So how d'you knew we can trust these guys? Because they're professionals. Yeah, professional criminals, man. Yeah, exactly, they've got, you know, reputations to consider. Score is, um... one of them words... multi, uh, many meanings. You know? Like, "What's the score?" Could be a football score. Could be a film score. Crime. The big score. "What's going down? What's happening?" Drugs, music, sex. "Did you score last night?" Oh, scored with a blinder pal. Revenge. "I got a score to settle." What score? No, it's a meaning. Oh. Really? If we do this regular, that's gonna add up nice. Say we double our money each time, that's expinential. Do you know expinential? It's like, one, two, four... eight, sixteen. It's a curve like this. Shhwoop! 16, 32, 64... Now, suppose one is a thousand. That tops a mil. In like, nine steps. And we got 20k in that bag. So, that's 20 mil. Go on then. Ten mil. Dare to dream, Mikey. Expinential. Ex-po-nential. English not so good as the maths, yeah? I got in an A in English once, man. My mum nearly had a heart attack. Said, "Why can't you do that every time?" Got more grief then than I did when I came home with loads of Fs. - Mind you, I was only... - Earphones. Good pair of noise canceling earphones. It's 10 mil, Mikey. You can get a lot more than that for... Oh. Yeah, but it'll do you no good, man. Can't drive with earphones in. - Illegal, innit? - Yeah, you're right. The illegality would trouble me. You don't get more out of it that way, by the way. You do shit your way and I'll do shit mine, okay? Everybody's happy. What the fuck are you doing? Doing shit my way. Now everyone's happy. Fucking hell. Do not leave that car, all right? Eyes wide for any dodgy shit. - A bag. - Uh, bags are 5p. Where's your toilet? Uh, toilets are not really for customers. So, it's just around the corner. No calls, or I'll come back and rip off your arm like this. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the fuck are you doing? Get in. Get in, get in. Do I know you? I don't know you. So, what happened? Well? The one at the pump... he was filling up, and then... he came round, and then... - the other one got out. - And then they went for you? Yeah. Well, no. Not... not exactly. I mean, I didn't wait for that, you know? 'Cause I mean, he got out. It's a... it's a petrol station. People get out. I got out. You got out. What... Then what happened? Bloody hell, Troy. Did you just demolish two blokes for moving in the wrong fucking direction? Oh, hello. Yeah. Oh. You've had a call. They found your brain. They want you to go and pick it up. Don't do that, man. I'm not stupid. Oh, no, "I'm not stupid. I got an A in English once." - That was for Shakespeare. - Fucking frame it. Shakespeare's tough. You do not stop, do you? If the only way to shut you up was to blow up the... The whole fucking world, nuclear holocaust, give me the button. All right, this is me blowing up the whole fucking world. I think you might be slightly overreacting, man. Nearly there. Get ready. What if they got guns? If they got guns, move fast. You're always telling me how fast you are. You know the speed of a bullet? No. Me neither. But I'm not that fast. You disappoint me. In that case, try and die gracefully. We're not bringing the money? You think we're doing this inside? I don't know. Why'd you pick this place, man? I didn't. They did. It's like a morgue. There's even a corpse. Do you know why you're here? - Yeah. - No, you don't. You ever sleep with a girl just 'cause you felt sorry for her? That's you, that is. The pity fuck. Piss off, man. I'm here in Derek's place. Yeah, he's the one that pity fucked you, your own brother. Incestuous pity fuck. That's low as it gets. Me, I wouldn't snog you for a million quid. That's your loss, man. On both counts. Wait here and don't talk to anyone. Do you want something or are you just looking? - It doesn't look eatable. - Edible. What? The word is edible. Oh yeah, I know the word. You just choose not to use it. Must be a poet. Yeah. What are you after, Shakespeare? Black coffee. Three shots. Mmm. Tough guy. Methinks. - Anything else? - Yeah. - What's this look? - This look? Yeah. - Pointillist. - What? - Abstract expressionist. - That's not a thing, is it? Na√Øve. What about you? Cubist. That's actually not bad. Oi. Is that your boss? He's not my boss. I don't have a boss. But you're gonna do what he said though, right? I told you to stay here. You didn't say stay at the table. It's not like I left. And don't talk to anyone. We're low profile, you get it? It's not table service. What, so we sit here and don't order anything? How low profile is that? Find out anything? They've been held up. It's not table service, Shakespeare. I'll have one and all. Still not table service. You brought his. Yeah, well, he's a poet. Him? Christ. Cappuccino. Are you deaf? Yeah. Are you discriminating? Nice. - You're in there. - Piss off. She's cute, if she wasn't done up like a freak. You're a match made in heaven. Cute freak heaven. - So, what's the plan then? - What? Oh right, yeah, um... well, uh, - they'll come in. - Mm-hmm. They'll check us out, we'll check them out, and go outside together, and then um, that's where the um, the handover... What's the fucking point? Perfect. Cappuccino. Thanks. Hand delivered, despite normal procedure and unpaid for, both of them. - Pay the girl. - Lady. - Really? - You better believe it. Pay the lady, Troy. Troy. - Keep the change. - Flash. There is no change. Right. Do I still keep the change? Yeah. What is this crap on top? Chocolate, cappuccino it's a default ingredient. - Everyone knows that, man. - You don't even know what default means. Most people ask. All right, we're done here. Go burn some toast. Freak. Fucking hell. Home time, Frank. See you tomorrow. Fuck me, can't be. - What? What's up? - It's them blokes you beat up. - What? Where? - Don't let them see you. Come on. Oh. Come on. So sorry, Frank. It's not table service. Empty bloody room, he goes and sits in my fucking... I'm not hiding from those sausages, man. Then what, Boy Wonder, we hang out, tell a few gags, reminisce about that time you beat the shit out of them? - What if it's them? - Who? The ones we're waiting for. It's not. - How d'you know? - Can't be. Shit. Our... Our guys wouldn't let a kid jump them. I'm fast, man. It could be. All right. It's ringing. They're not moving. Oh, yeah. It's me, uh, again. Just checking something. Um, no, it's fine. Just, we had a little situation. Just wait for the all clear, all right? See now they'll take us for a pair of fools. They haven't even met you yet. Fuck's sake. - What do we do now? We need these two losers to clear off. Oh, thank Christ. Back. Get back, get back! Get back! Fuck it. Go, go, go. What if the... Wait. We're in the gent's. Why didn't he use the ladies' like anyone else would? Some people aren't like that, man. Your day is about to get a whole lot worse. Bet you didn't think that could happen. - What are you doing? - I want some food. What's going on? I'm hungry. What are you doing to my customers? They paid, didn't they? What kind of name is Troy? - It's classic. - You mean classical. You like to tell people what they mean, don't you? Do you want something? - What's the special? - There is no special. What you see is what you get. - No special? - No special. And people waiting. - Is that it? - And the special. - There is no special. - You're pretty special. Wow. Did you just say that? No, he did. You're pretty special. - Keep the change? - Don't push your luck. Why not? It's the only way you get anything. Jesus. Does your head move in any other direction? She's playing you, man. Yeah. Well, maybe I like it. What are you so stressed about? Thank you. Up 'til now... we're nobodies, me and Derek. As for you... I'm a nobodies gopher. Exactly. Well put. So, I'm sick of being the guy in the shit that other people step on to get ahead. Derek gets locked up. What's he got to show for it? A few grand covered in dirt? Sod that. What's your point, man? That. That's my point. Forget it. Just... I wanted that out there. Fair enough. Yeah, what's... What's keeping you? Seen enough? You... You have the interesting face. - Someone else said beautiful. - Beauty? Beauty is . May I? - What for? - To... To make the art. Maybe one day you... wake up and... see your face in a... in a book. Or in a poster. Just like that. The fate redeemed. Bravo. You pay me? Why for I pay you? Maybe you pay me? Why for I pay you? Because I offer you immortality. What's the price of that? Well, I don't want that. - Who wants to live forever? - I'm thinking everyone. Who's this? - He wants to take my photo. - What for? - The art. - Piss off. This... This is your friend's decision I think. You can think what you like, mate, but piss off. Okay. Keeping a low profile, are you? Oh, yeah, it's not enough that you beat up some blokes, and now you want your photo taken. Leave a fucking calling card why don't you? So, where are they? - Who? - The blokes we're waiting for. How do I know? You were just talking to them. No, couldn't get through. They rang you. - What? - Your phone rang, man. You weren't calling out. They called you. Oh, that was nothing. Thought you said it was a burner phone. So? So, no one else has the number. What the fuck is this? - I'm just saying. - Well don't say. Just eat your food and be ready, shit. Look, I gave the school this number, right? 'Cause Angel's not been well and Sal's out of town. What's wrong with Angel? Shingles. - Shingles? - Yeah. Shingles is stones on a beach. What are you, a geologist? Well, if the school calls, you can hardly go pick her up. No shit, Sherlock. Then I call my mom. It's not table service. She shouldn't be at school if she's still contagious. Fuck. The quarantine period is over, right? - So, she can go, yeah? - Why don't you just give your mom's number in the first place? Piss off. Go on. I've had it. That's it. Just, if you hear a car, come back. 'Til then, go have your mugshot taken, or go chat up the freak. No, no, no. In fact, leave. Fuck. How long have you been there? It's my break. Do you mind? No. Could you... be a bit more enthusiastic? Give us a push. Fight with the boss? He's not my boss. Oh. Lovers tiff. - Funny. He has the air of a women beater. He'd hit anyone, to be fair. He's equal opportunities. Oh. Very modern. Sussed him last week when he was in. Him? Are you sure? Yeah. You don't forget a face like that. Trust me, you try. What are you doing with him? We came for a drive in the country. Sweet. I don't know your name. You never asked. - Well? - Fine, thanks. You like to make a man work. Only the ones who are used to having it easy. You think that's me? Some things come easy. Maybe not the ones you think. What is it? Gloria. Gloria. It works. Gee, thank you. Sharp, aren't you, Gloria? Yeah. Don't cut yourself. I like your smile. That's not a line. It's a line. But I'll bite. What are you doing here, Gloria? Waiting for something better to come along. - You can't wait. - Huh. Take it. Whatever it is you want. What if it belongs to someone else? - You use force. - Hmm. Is that what you do? Where I'm from, it's the done thing. Move. Moving's easy. Shit gets stuck on your shoes. Move farther, change shoes. - After you. Sounds easy, right? Just put one foot in front of the other. Yeah. Hiya, it's me. Listen. Um, I'm thinking... I've been thinking... like... we can do this without hurting him. Did you just laugh? All right, forget it. No, no. Forget it. As planned. Yeah. As planned. Right. The love. Ineffable. Here we go. Please. May I make art of great and tragic beauty? I thought you said beauty was... Everything is like this, no? Except for art. And what's it for? - He wants to make you immortal. - Yeah? And also eternally youthful. Oh, you had me at immortal. No, no, no, no, no. On its own. Hold on, you didn't tell me that. You did not want it. Negotiations are defunct. You permit? And also, for you... I take a precious capture of the moment. - Please. I am invisible. Act as nature intended. Be your destiny. What a nut. Do you have a good side? I'm not all bad. No, I mean for the camera. Oh. I don't know. Do you permit? - Hmm. - Hmm? Both sides ming. - What? He said beautiful. He said, "interesting". - It's rude to eavesdrop. - It's rude to lie. Okay, show me what you got. Oh, sorry. - Hello? Thank you. Yeah, I'm still here. Now you live forever... like it or not. Oi. Cindy Crawford. Stop arsing about. Get back here. - You said to wait 'til... - You're an embarrassment. Proposed yet? No. I'd have to ask her dad first. Very proper. Oh, he'd be chuffed to get you for a son-in-law. And why wouldn't he be? 'Cause you got shit for brains and shit for prospects. No one's good enough for a dad. Not even the best. As for you... Give it a rest, Mike. Mind you, he'd probably be delighted to get shot of that freak. Fuck off, man. Fuck off. - Next time you... - Next time, nothing. Christ. It is love. You might be right. Maybe she won't want it. What I have. The girls around us... the girls we know... the people we know... she's not like them. She's different. Oh. No, no, no. She only looks different. They're all the same. Money. Cash, money. Just you wait, she'll want it. You were here last week, man. What of it? I thought they picked the place. They did. So, I came to scope it out... because I'm not a halfwit. Preparation, bright eyes. Preparation. What's with bridezilla? Nothing a few grand won't cure, eh? Customers aren't allowed back here. I'm not big on rules. It's the poet in me. Are you all right? You one of those men who can't deal with tears? No. I can't get enough of them. I box a bit, right? And... if I get punched... and it's a good one... and he knows he's caught me... I laugh. Because if I don't, he's going to hit me again, and harder. So, I give this big grin, like I didn't feel nothing. And he sees that... and he knows I'm not going down. Like, "Screw you, pal. Is that it? I'm laughing." Boxing's barbaric. These are like, valuable life lessons I'm offering you, and that's your take? That's it. Who is this bozo anyway? No one. Right. Well, you just remember that then. - Mmm, okay. - He's no one. - I will. - Exactly. No, I will remember that, thank you so much. Bye. Take care now. Shit. I got to go. I like your smile. A lot. Safe to say that's not them. Oh, Christ. That's all we need is more bloody drama. Shit. Oh, I didn't see that coming. Why is it always someone else's pain that makes you happy? Oh, come on, man. That's comedy. Rule number one. Thought we had something. Aw, she's stringing you along, man. - Didn't I tell you? - You know less than shit. Whatever, lady killer. She's old enough to be her mom. She's somebody's mom. - How do you know? - Kid's seat in the back. She's got a wedding ring, too. Wonder if the hubby has got a clue. Gloria's smart enough to know better. I don't know anyone that smart, man. It could be their kid, mind. Anything goes these days. Sit the fuck back down. We got other fish to fry. Maybe now you can get your head out of the clouds. - Don't judge me. - What? You don't know me, so don't judge. I'm not. Good. It's not what it looks like. Okay, it's what it looks like, but you... you have to understand that... I'm stuck. Stuck being? - Don't be a fucking idiot. - I don't know. - And don't pigeonhole me. - I'm not. You guys are all the fucking same. I'm not the same. He's the same. I... well, not as me. It's the rest. I don't care, in a good way. I... it doesn't matter, is what I'm trying to say. Only, what about me? You? Can you sit here? So, how'd you make this about you then? What, in a Venn diagram? - A what? - A Venn diagram. Intersecting circles with common properties. I thought that's what you said. Okay. Venn diagram. All right, this better be good. Um... this is me and... my circle of shit. And this is you... - and your circle... - My circle of shit is way bigger than that. So is mine, to be fair. - I'm going to clear that up. - Yeah. Where the two circles of shit... intersect that's... two circles of shit overlapping. This bit, right here, it's a little bit about me. It's about us. Hello? Hello? Where are you? No, no, no. I said, no, wait there. I said... I said, "left at the junction." Oh fuck. Hold on. I told her... I'd expose her. I'm blackmailing a married woman into keeping seeing me. Who does that? That's why she drove over. To stop me from telling her husband or the school. She was my old French teacher. Ooh, la, la. Sorry. It's just how I deal with shit. It doesn't mean I'm not serious. I'm really sorry. Go on. Well, that's it. Story over. What would it take for us to go away together? For real? I mean, we could pretend, but I don't know how that would work. Pretend. I live in the real world. I don't want to swap out one circle of shit for another circle of shit. How much have you got? - Nothing. - No shit. You're sweet. But not so smart. What if I could get ten grand? You'll be smarter, but probably less sweet. And if it's not clean? Violence, anything that abuses people fuck right off. I don't want to be hooked up with someone who might get locked away for years. I want someone with a future. - Not a married woman with kids. - Is that an issue? No. Clean slates. Clean slates all round. Clean slates, dirty money. Do you like boats? - Do what? - Boats. What kind of boats? Like the one out there. Little sailing boat. Something you can take people out on. You know, for hire. Do you know how to a sail a boat? I know how to drive a car. Can't be that hard. And on a boat, you don't even need to stay on the road. You got the whole sea. Little fishing villages... tourists, places like Spain or Italy. Hmm. Or Greece. I saw pictures of Greece once in a magazine at the dentist. - Have you never been? - Uh-uh. You know they speak Greek there? Take me seriously. Sorry. It's how I cope with shit. Fair play, I see what you did there. Yeah, you know, your name comes from over that way, too. See? Destiny. Although it didn't end well for that Troy. - It got sacked, didn't it? - Yeah. I've been sacked before, though. It's not that bad. I'm not sure if some of the things you say are really smart or really stupid. Oh, well, but that's my superpower. - Okay. - You know, keep them guessing. Smart stupidity. If you don't fancy Greece, I'm... open to suggestions. I like boats. I saw one in a magazine once. I'll handle him. How's the m√©nage √† trois? That's French for "you've been had". Yeah, it's not like that. You could have fooled me. - That's not hard. - Don't get smart. - What if we only buy half? - You what? What if I don't put my share in? - Your share? - Derek's share, my share. Oh my Christ. You're dumber than I thought. And that's a low bar. You think you're all that, Mike. But it's down to Derek that you're anything. - Fuck off. - You know it. He was the man before he went down, and you, you were his shadow. You know, that's what he called you. His shadow. "Anyone seen my shadow knocking about? Where's my dopey shadow got to?" All right, yeah, if he's so smart, how come he ends up inside? I'll tell you how. Because he decided to go solo. It was fucking shit, his plan. And I told him. I told him I wanted nothing to do with it. But it didn't stop him using our joint funds. So, fuck him. Because look where that got him, yeah? Yeah? And the only good thing he did was stash the cash before they got him. So, fuck him again for not telling me where. Mike. I still say half that money's mine. And what you do with your half... Okay, okay. Okay. All right. Let's not go... go around in circles, all right? All right then. - Is that them? - No. How d'you know? Because they told me what to look out for. How else are we going to know it's them? Hiya. Hi Orla. How's school? So, I can just take it? Well, you can't just piss off and leave me hanging. Wait until they get here. If they say "All right," then, okay. If they look like they're going to kill me, then, you know... fair enough? Fair enough. Remember when Derek let me sit in on that poker night? Yeah. Yeah. You cried like a baby, because you lost your pocket money. Then you lost yours. Yeah. No tears, though. No, you're all man. Exactly. Happy days. Hey, Troy. Remember when he called you on that last hand? - Cleared you out? - Yeah. Two sevens. Who the fuck calls on that crap? He read you, man. You were tearing up beer mats all night when you bluffed. Yeah. Well, we're not playing poker now. Lucky for you. I need a piss. Still having second thoughts? Well... Well, he's my best mate's little brother. It's like, what you want? I mean, he like one of my own. It's not his fault. There's no other way. Derek has to think he got killed when the deal went bad... or he'll come for us when he gets out. Right. Close the fucking door. You don't even have to do it. So... what are you bleating about? Just wait until it's closing, and everyone's gone, and that girl is busy. - I know. - Yeah? And make sure that she sees that you're still inside. And then just... send him out. Hey, look, he's uh... Ju... Just mind out, yeah? He's fast, yeah? He likes to say it, but... it's true. Is he faster than a bullet? You going to wash your hands? I think they're clean. I don't know. It's been a while. Forget the money. I'll leave with you. Just don't take any chances. What about the real world? Ha, sod the real world. I lived there, didn't rate it. Leave the money. It is mine. And my brother's. But he's got no use for it. And he sort of owes me, for getting me wrapped up in all this. And for a life thrown away. It's not thrown away. Not yet. Can I kiss you? I swear saw this. When? Before. Always. Go and break the good news. Before I change my mind. No, mate. No, this is... This place is closing soon. No. Sod it. Forget it. Trying to change the deal on us. Told them to piss off. Should that's it then. Yeah. Closing up, gentlemen. Five minutes. So, that's it then. Yeah. Go and get your half. You don't want to come out and check? No, I'm going to... I'm going to drink my coffee. That will be cold by now. People pay a lot of money for cold coffee. Go on. Don't you want it? He shouldn't have hidden it. Half of that was mine. He had no business keeping it from me. That's between you and him, man. Let's not go around in circles, eh? Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry that this is, um... ending like this between us. Don't be. Best of both worlds. - Who's there? Come out. Are you not going to help him? Mike. Mike! Ambush! What are you doing? Don't... it's dangerous. Call the police. Lock the doors. No... What are you doing? Sal. Bloody hell. - You scared the life out of me. - Why? 20,000 reasons. - All the same. - What the fuck, Sal? Ah! Uh, Sal. Look, uh, you can take it. All right? I don't want it. What about Derek? Tell him, uh... tell Derek... Tell him I took it, all right? I'm gone anyway. Mikey! Mikey, he's onto us. - Fuck! Gloria! - Mike! - Don't hurt her. - Ah! Gloria. - Fuck, Sal! - Sal, stop! Stop! Where is he? Stop, it's me! Are you fucking crazy? Yes, I'm crazy! Look what he's done to me! Where is he? Stop. It's fucking empty. Reload. Fuck. Troy! Troy! I'm sorry. You've got to go. You got to go. Just go. I'll hold him up. Go. Go, get out of here. What you doing, man? Where is she? She's long gone. You don't have to do this, Mikey. Too late for that now. I'm going. You'll never see me again. I'm sorry, Troy. You believe me, don't you? What are you doing? I'm laughing. Well, stop it. Troy. Stop it. I said stop it. No, no, no, no! Don't, don't, don't! What? Don't be daft. That's not me. Come on. Mike! Mikey. Oh, God. - Fuck! Not again. Sal. You all right? Not me, them. Get them. Turns out I am faster than a bullet. You all right? No, leave it. Leave it, leave it. You still coming with me? I'm in the car. Someone's trying to shoot you, though. Hey. I'm in the car. - Yeah. - Yeah. You are. Check the money. Okay. Okay. What do you see? I see the sun... I see the sea. I see a boat. I see a lot more than... - How much? - Twenty. A score? A what? It's another word for 20. Among prophets and poets. Score. What a word. - We did it. - Yeah. I have something to tell you. - There's a catch. - You're married. No. Today... that was me at my best. That was my high point. And it's all downhill from here. Yeah. All the way. But what a ride.
