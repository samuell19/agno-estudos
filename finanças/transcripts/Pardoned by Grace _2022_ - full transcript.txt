(car whirring) - Get in here captain coke dealer, you're gonna give us both up. - Sorry, man. Just wanted to make sure you weren't some kind of cop or something. - Do I look like a cop? - It's all good, what you need man? - I need the hardest stuff you got. - You do, huh? Let me see some money. - I just saw you sling a whole bag to that crackhead. Now show me what you got. - How much you want? - All of it. - That's all I got man, better have the money. - So concerned with the money, I got your money. So here's the deal. We can do this the easy way or the hard way, you can either go down for possession and intent, or you could write down the name of your supplier right here and I'm gonna go after the bigger fish, your choice. You got three seconds, three, two. Have a nice jog loser. (car whirring) I'm gonna ask you one more time. What did you do with it Shannon? - Didn't do nothing. - You're lying to me, you are lying to me. I had four bags of that stuff. What did the drug fairy fly in here and take off with it. - You probably used it all yourself. - Your pupils are as big as quarters. How much did you use? How much, I was gonna sell that to pay bills Shannon. You have no idea what I had to go through to get that, I could have been shot. You want me dead Shannon? You want me dead, you want me dead? You call the cops, I'm gonna kill you. - Don't you take my car. (birds chirping) (car whirring) (banging) - What happened to your neck, bro? - What do you think happened to my neck? Shannon stole my stuff again. - What? - Yeah. - That's just wrong. - Yep. - Did you call the cops? - No. - And so what's the description of that stolen vehicle again? - I think she did though. Yep. (sirens whirring) Hold on. (banging) (car whirring) - They bow him out with two. - [Speaker] Clear. (footsteps running) - Come on, man, get up. - On your knees now. Now, get down. Get down onto your knees, hands on your head. - Sorry man. - Hey, hey, hey. (water falling) - Excuse me, ma'am, do you mind if I use your phone just for a minute? Oh no, it's okay. I just wreck my car, I just. - I don't think so. (sirens whirring) - Dude, I need you to come pick me up at your grandma's house right now. - [Speaker 2] What, what are you doing at my grandma's house? Is she home? - No, she's not home. Look, I had a ditch Shannon's car, Harley got arrested. The cops are everywhere. I need you to come pick me up right now. (insects chirping) Thanks for getting me, man. - Yeah, man, no worries. Are you you sure it's safe to come back here so soon? - Oh yeah, the lights are out. So she's either in bed or she's split. Actually, I hope she's gone. She uses too much of my stash anyway. - Yeah, you don't want that. - I'll see you tomorrow. - All right man. - Later, stay safe. - Yep. (door banging) (gentle music) - Morning sunshine. - You see what you get for hitting me. You see what you get. You stole my car and got it impounded, big man now, huh? - Get him in the car. - He's got weed in the house too. (beeping) (footsteps banging) - Mr. Highberger, you're back again. - He's racking up the frequent flyer miles. - Put him in D2. (gentle music) - You do know the rules, right? You resist to hand you a whooping. - I know my rule, never go without a fight. I gave as good as I got. - Yeah, maybe, but I don't see them sitting on this bench with a fancy bracelet on, but I will give you credit though. It took about four of them to drag you up in here. - It's not even my best number, man, six. - Six, impressive. - I was younger. - Yeah, weren't we all the first time in. - I was 16 I think. (footsteps banging) - That looks like our boy. - Battery to a police officer, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, minor in possession. Possession of a controlled substance. Possession of drug paraphernalia. - Oh, why can't kids go to the bowling alley to actually bowl? - It looks like the owner was cited for serving alcohol to a minor. - Good, any other churches for our esteemed client? - That's not enough for you counselor. I've got his entire criminal history right here if you have a few hours, first brush with the law was at 12, stole his mom's car and burnt up the engine and a pursuit. - Be a public defender they said, it'll be fun they said. - That's the same thing they said to social workers. So his risk assessment is way above 12. So he'll be staying in the padded cell until his hearing. They say he is an irrefutable danger to himself and to others. - Don't suppose it will do any good to request the judge remand him to mom and dad in the interim? - Don't want him, mom and stepdad say he's too much to handle. And he says he doesn't wanna be bothered with them either. So that's why I'm here. - What about bio dad. - Florida, not much contact. - Okay, let's have them bring him in. - I ain't got nothing to say. - Relax kid, we're on your side. - You my lawyer? - Kyle Devidy, court appointed counsel, looks like you've had a busy night, drinking, drugging, fighting. You're off to a flying start kid. - We're here to help you Scott. - Nobody can help me. - Well, we can try if you let us. - I think the judge will reduce the felony to a misdemeanor if we. - Just plead guilty and send me to jail. - You want to go to jail? - Beats going home. From that day on, I never backed down from a fight and I never pled not guilty. I was always like to the police and the courts and just whoever, bring it. You're not gonna break me. - Winning, right? - I guess so. - And like I said before, yet you are the one sitting on this bench with a fancy bracelet. And those guys you just showed are heading home to a good meal and night sleep in their own bed. Well, I'm just making a pit stop on my way to the pen and by the looks of things, you're not too far behind, I'll save you a bunk kid. - You want to plead guilty Scott? - Might as well, if I get out, they're just gonna find another reason to stick me back in here. - Pleading guilty can have very serious ramifications, with your criminal history, the judge will. - Just plead guilty and let me worry about the rest. It's my life, okay. Nobody runs it but me. - All right, I'll enter a guilty plea. I hope you know what you're in for. - I've known my whole life what I'm in for. (footsteps walking) (people chattering) - We had a special request for you. - Will be at eight yourselves. - [Announcer] D block visitation will be between one. - You also brought me out of a horrible ditch, out of the clay and set my feet upon a rock and establish my steps. Psalm 40, verse two. - Amen. - What's that supposed to mean? - Where you get stuck in some quick sand, guy's gonna pull you out? - That's exactly what it means to my brother. See, every one of us are behind these bars because we fell into some kind of quick sand. - Yeah. - Maybe not the real kind, but the spiritual kind. And the really sad thing is, most of the time, this quick sand we made ourselves, you like using your fist to lie. - Why, you wanna go? - I used to be a fighter too, just mad at the world, blaming it for all my problems. It turned out the person I was really fighting was myself. Took me a long time to go from this, to this. - But once I did, it made all the difference. Why don't you come with us tonight? I mean, what have you got to lose? I should asked what have you got left to lose? (gentle music) - Glad to see everybody here tonight. Jones, good to see you, glad that everybody's here. Steve, I'm glad you're able to make it out. And it's great to see everybody here tonight. Looking forward to a great time, Bible study. It's always a blessing to see everybody. And I hope that you've got your Bibles with you. Take just a moment. - Hello Scott. - Oh, hey warden. - Glad to see you finally here, have a seat. Yeah, come on. - Something a little differently. Does everybody know what this is? Yeah, sure, we all do. It's a yo-yo, its sole purpose is to go up and down and back and forth. Unfortunately it's like many of us, we've been in and out of jail, back and forth so many times that just makes you sick. Just get so tired of it. But yet we find ourselves doing the same thing over and over, my friends, it doesn't have to be that way. We don't have to stay in this orange jumpsuit. God has given us his grace, he's given us his love. He's given us his son and through his son, we can transcend these bars, we can overcome the chains. We can be free through Jesus Christ. The Bible says he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son, hath not life. The Bible says that the thief cometh, but for to still and to kill and to destroy. But Jesus said, I am come that you might have life and have it more abundantly. Romans 8:2 says that for the law of the spirit of life is found in Jesus Christ. And it overcomes the law of sin. My brothers with Jesus, you can break these bars. You can transcend these chains. Are you sick and tired of being like a yo-yo, being pulled back and forth? You can overcome, you can cut this string. If you want freedom, true freedom that these bars cannot contain, then I invite you tonight to come to know the one who can set you free. Jesus said that I am the way, the truth in the life. And no man comes to the father but through me, every one of us is guilty of sin and we deserve to pay the price for sin. But Jesus has paid the price. All you have to do is believe. All you have to do is accept it, stop fighting, stop resisting in just surrender. - And the Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? When evil do me, uttering slanders against me. My adversaries and, they shall stumble and fall. - Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be down on earth as is in heaven. Give us each day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses. We figured those trespass against us, lead us is not in a temptation but deliver us from for thy. (people chattering) - What, you got a problem, what? - Grace and power, give you all the pain, all the fear, all the anxiety paralyzing me, please free my mind and my body. I'm gonna be what I was meant to be. Amen. - Well done. (door knocking) - Hello Scott, how you doing? - Doing good, Mr. Pazera - Have a seat please. Well, your street clothes still fit. - Little snug, but anything's better than prison orange, sir. - Yeah, I bet. So you ready for the real world? - Ready as I'll ever be, I guess. - You know, we want you to understand that we consider you one of our success stories. I mean you've cleaned up real well. Even earned your associate's degree. - Yes sir, business. I'm gonna go to college and get my bachelor's and maybe run my own company one day, who knows? - No reason in the world why you can't, really proud of you. You understand that don't you? - Thank you, Mr Pazera, that really means a lot. - Well, I would say don't be as stranger, but. - I hope I never see you again, sir. And I mean that in a good way. - Yeah. Look, you take care, but don't forget, in all your ways acknowledge him and he'll make your path straight. Proverbs. - Three, six, yes sir. - Thank you for everything, sir. - You're welcome. Now get outta here. - Yes, sir.

There's more snowfall around down there than in Colorado. - Look, Scott. - Don't look me Dwight.

But thank you. - What's this? - Open it up. - What happened to that kid Scott? He was doing so well. - I don't know, I guess he just lost his mind. - When he had to go back to prison to find it again, really? You get outta here real soon. What's gonna change after you leave these bars behind you? You just gonna throw away everything you've accomplished here, just leave it at the front gate. - No sir. I'm gonna do better. - Yeah, that's what you said last time. - But I mean it this time, I mean it this time. - Yeah, well I hope that's true. I really do, speaking as your warden, I really hope you stick to the straight and narrow. Is it okay if I talk to you as a brother in Christ? - Of course. - You know when you left here, you turned your back on the only one who would never turn his back on you, created this void in your life. Tried to fill it with drugs, alcohol, Lord knows what else, I've seen you working out around the gym, right? And what happens when you exercise a muscle? - Get stronger. - Exactly, don't you ever forget that? So you exercise your faith, guess what? It gets stronger, but say you choose to exercise sin, it gets bigger and bigger until it consumes you. - A man cannot serve two masters for you either love one and hate the other. - Yeah, Matthew 6:24. Yeah, you can say that all you want up here, but you gotta get it here son. Can I pray with you? Heavenly father, I pray over this man. Your son, your servant, Scott Highberger.

You can see we have the same last name though. (person typing) Hey pop. Get your errands done already. - You stole from me. - What, what are you talking about? I would never do that. - You stole from me. I opened my home to you and you stole from me. - Dad, what are you talking about? I would never steal from you. - The bank called, the manager was suspicious about a check they cashed. - I just needed a loan, I thought you'd be okay with it. - There's puke all over the bathroom. You've been drinking my mouthwash. - No, I was just freshening up. - Just get out. You haven't changed one bit. - But dad. - No buts, just go. Or I call the cops and you go to jail for forgery.

Do a report and the disturbances. - Sir, I need you to step outta the car. - What for? - Sir, just step outta the car. Step around the front please. - What for? - You got a suspended license. - Oh, can you just write me a ticket or something? - What happened at that bar back there? - Oh, that was just a misunderstanding.

I'm CJ. - I'm Scott. Nice to meet you Scott. Right through the door, sir. - Thank very much. - Proverbs 10:5 says, he who gathers during summer and takes advantage of his opportunities is a son who acts wisely, but he who sleeps during harvest and ignores the moment of opportunity is a son who acts shamefully. Jesus is communicating to his disciples, the harvest, it's too big for any of us. And we need to pray for God to send more workers into the field. The word worker here in the Greek is, and it's used 15 times in the New Testament. It elevates action over business. A worker is a disciple who is actively involved in the process of evangelizing the lost or establishing the saved. Let me clarify that a worker is not someone on full-time staff at a church. Once you become a Christ follower, you become a co-labor with Christ. If a paycheck is what motivates you to minister to people, you're doing it for the wrong reason. Look at Paul in Acts 28 versus 30 and 31. It says Paul lived there for two full years at his own expense, in his own rented lodging and welcomed all who came to him, preaching and proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness and boldness, unhindered and unrestrained. (audience clapping) Amen. - We work on the ones that you have to have committed to your memory, that's how works. Anyway, okay. Hey, very nice to meet you. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. Hey, what's up? I'm Dave. - Oh, hey, I saw you preaching up there. My name is Scott. - Hi Scott, nice to meet you, first time here? - First time, yeah. Hope it didn't put you to sleep. Sermon a little long, but. - No, no it was great. - Good. - Great, yeah, well thank you. All right I'm gonna get going. - Come back anytime. - Okay. - All right. Hey Scott, crazy question. Are you looking for work? - What are you thinking? - Well we're kind of in desperate need around here. Just for clean up, stacking chairs, actually mopping floors believe it or not. - You know, I actually have a lo of experience mopping. - No way, Seriously - I do. - um... Sure, I'll take it, you have time, can I show you around? You have time? Can I show you around? Yeah, now? - Yeah, like five, 10 minutes just to show you around the place. - All right, okay. (hoover whirring) (water dripping) - Scott, you already stacking chairs? - Of course pastor. - Church's only been over 20 minutes. You are a godsend, do you know that? Did I say something wrong? - I just been needing to talk to you about something. - Sounds serious, what's up? Step into my office. So what you got? - Well, haven't always been, I used to be. - A troublemaker, addict, alcoholic, felon. I know, so what? - You're not worried? - About, what? That you're gonna drink all the communion wine here at the church. We use great juice Scott, let me ask a question. An important one. Do you believe Christ died on the cross for your sins? - Of course. - And do you believe the blood of Christ is sufficient to wash your sins away? - I'm just worried about what other people think. - It doesn't matter what other people think, what matters is what God thinks. He says you're redeemed, you're redeemed. - But I've done so much. - It doesn't matter, period. Let me ask you something, when you were in lockup, did you meet other prisoners who had come to know Christ? - Yeah. We called them the crucifix crew. - And I guessing there were a bunch of choir boys who were only in there for a few parking tickets, right? - When you're inside, you don't really talk about what you're locked up for. But judging by their sentences, they did some pretty bad things. A few of them were lifers. - Yeah. - Worse the crime, harder the punishment, right? - Something like that. - So can you imagine any harder punishment than being nailed to a cross until you die? - No. - Exactly, what sin could not be covered by that? Clean up. - I'll tell you, I sure wish some more guys in the joint could understand what Jesus did so that they too could be saved. - Wait a minute, like a prison ministry? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey pastor Vanessa. - Hey you, what brings you in here? - Pastor Dave says he needed my help down here at the church thrift store today. - He did did he? - Yeah. - Well, what I actually asked was for him to come help me, but that's okay. It looks like my husband did the old switcheroo, Danielle and I could use some help. And it's good to see you just the same. - Danielle. - Yeah, the one you've been too afraid to talk to the past couple of months. - I haven't been afraid, I just didn't have anything to say. - Well, that's good because these somehow got in the wrong section and you can bring them to her for revamping. - Want me to bring them? - I do. - Okay. - Right over there. - She's over there? - All right. - You can do it. - Hey, pastor Vanessa wanted me to hand these to you. - Okay, did you say what to do with them? - Just label them or unlabel them or something. - Okay, you can put them right there. - Put them over here. Yeah, okay. I cannot believe I just did that. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - Hold on a minute. - I got it, I got it, don't, it's fine. - You sure? I'm such an idiot, I'm sorry. - You're fine. - Oh man, I'm sorry. - Yeah, it's fine. - Okay, all right, okay. - I'm Scott, by the way. - I know. - That's awesome. Pastor Dave, which light did you say needed? - Yes, sir, come here. Yes, sir. Yeah, that's great. All right. All right, thank you so much. All right, we'll see you then. That was the prison Scott. No, nothing bad. They approved our request. - What request? - I kind of made a request for you and I to go minister to the inmates. - We minister to the prisoners? - I sure hope so. - What about me? I mean, are they gonna let a convicted felon in there? I asked them about that and they just want you to fill out an application. God's got a plan Scott, no rule of man can deny that purpose. He's still calls the shots. Remember, I'm optimistic enough for both of us. They're gonna email us the applications. - That's great. - [Pastor] Yeah. - [Danielle] Had a great time today. It was fun hanging with you and thanks for the help. Sweet dreams, Danielle. - [Scott] I had a really good time with you to. If you ever need someone to fold your clothes, I am your man. (person laughing) There's something you probably need to know about me. (dinging) - Surprise. - What are we doing here? - Well, the good news is, they've approved the first part of your application process. Today, they just wanna talk, it's okay, we're early. Just take a deep breath, it's all good. Hey, by the way, how'd the date go? - What date? - What date he says, come on. - You know about the date? - You know, the best way to spread gossip in a church. Telephone telegram, tele deacon, the small church, Scott. Everybody knows. - She's amazing isn't she? She's amazing. - I know, she's funny, smart, pretty, godly. I'm gonna marry her. - Should I be worried Scott? - No, God told me to do it. - Not hearing voices are you? - No, no, actually, before Bible study last night I asked God, I said, please just give me a sign that she's the woman for me. Let her show up with a red bow in her hair or something. - That's pretty specific. - It is, but you wanna know something? - What? - She showed up last night with a red bow in her hair? - No way. - Yes she did. - You gotta be kidding. - Yeah, I told you. - That's amazing. - I'm gonna marry her. - That's awesome. Hey question. Does she know about? - Yeah, I told her everything. - And? - She said, if God says you're clean, you're clean. That's good enough for me. - Now that's the response of a godly woman. - Proverbs 31, good woman is worth more than rubies. - Amen to that. - it's time. No handcuffs today my brother, they just wanna interview you. Okay. They just wanna talk, ready? (car beeping) Morning, everyone. - [Audience] Morning. - How's everybody doing? - [Audience] Good. - Thank you all for being here this morning. I brought my lovely wife, pastor Vanessa up here with me because we have a special announcement today. Matthew 19:26 tells us that with God, all things are possible. Things like turning our lives completely around, going from hopelessness to giving hope to others who are in the exact spot we once were. - We serve almighty God, don't we? - [Audience] Yes. - We do. Well yesterday I received a certified letter from the correctional facility. Danielle, would you do the honors? - Dear pastor Gargano, we are pleased to inform you that your congregant, Scott Hieberger has been approved for the prison ministry program with Road to Life Church. We look forward to receiving him into our facility. (audience cheering) - Thank you, are you kidding me, what? Thank you so much, this is such an honor. This is literally the greatest day of my whole life. Amen, right? Amen, wow. (audience cheering) Hey morning. - Get your turn around. - Thank you. - And he said it to Moses, I, my father-in-law, am come unto thee, And my wife and her two sons, thy kingdom come, thy will be done will be done on earth. - [Audience] On earth as it is in heaven. - Give us each day our daily bread. Wanna walk with him, okay? You wanna walk with him? Step by step, walk with him. Don't ever turn away, all things. Okay, and when he's your physician, you go to him, you have a problem, you go to him. Some times are thinking, why? Why, but that's not the question that we need to ask. We need to actually say thank you, I understand. I understand. - Okay, got one for you. Who was the greatest financier on the Bible? - I have no idea. - Noah, he was floating his stock while everyone else was in liquidation. - All, right, all right, now that is a good one. - So that kind of reminds me of you though. - Why is that? - Well, Noah listened to God and fulfilled his purpose. It's exactly what you've done Scott. I'm really proud of you. - It's not me, God's doing all the work here. - Yeah, well what a work he's doing, man, how many today? - 438 in attendance, sir. Three walked the aisle. (person laughing) - That is amazing. Hey, keep going, keep up the good work. - I plan on it, as a matter of fact, we're reaching out, seeing if we can get into the juvenile detention center. - Wow. - Because maybe if we can get them young, they won't never end up here. - Look, if there's anything that I can do for you, any way I can help, you gotta let me know, okay. - I already put in the application. We're just waiting to hear back. - Of course, great. - All right, thank you. - Hey. - Hey. I'm sorry, we have a problem. - Everything okay? - Your pass has been revoked. - But you know me, I preach here every week. - I'm sorry to inform you that it's been revoked and you no longer have access to this facility. - Why? - You have a warrant for your arrest. - It's outta Florida. Some old trouble I had from years ago. - And it just now popped up. - Yes, when I applied for access at the juvenile detention. - I don't understand if you had a warrant for your arrest, then why didn't they arrest you? - Florida won't extradite this far. - Okay, so if they won't arrest you, then why won't they let you back in the prison? - As long as I have a felony warrant, I'm disqualified for entering any correctional facility in the state. Isn't that ironic? I spent my whole life fighting to stay outta prison and now they won't let me back in. - You go knock over a liquor store. I'm kidding. - This is serious. If Scott isn't allowed back inside, then everything he's worked for is gone. - So what are our options? - I can either quit the prison ministry altogether, or I can go to Florida, turn myself in and take care of the warrant. - Turn yourself in, what happens then? - It's up to the judge. - Worst case scenario? - With what I've done. Looking at the possibility of 20 years. - Okay. It's a little overwhelming, but we can't forget we serve a big God and we don't stop at overwhelming, period. So what we do, we pray. Oh gracious heavenly Father. We ask you father for your guidance in this dark hour. - All right guys. So Scott recorded a video message for us. You guys ready to see it? - [Audience] Yeah. - Hey, what's up guys. As you no doubt have already heard, the reason why I'm not there in person and I'm sending you this video is because I'm on my way to prison. Something foolish I did years ago has finally caught up with me and rather than run from it like I've done my whole life, I've decided that this time, I wanna put it in God's hands. I'll see you soon. I might be spending the next 20 years behind the wire. But if that's what God has in store for me, I'm willing to accept it. Don't be upset. Hey, the apostle Paul did some amazing things while he was incarcerated and we can too. Okay, come on. - We're gonna all be down for the trial. And pastor Dave wanted me to tell you that the church is gonna keep paying you all you're away. So you don't have to worry about bills piling up and all that. I love you. - I love you too. - I don't know what's gonna happen. All I know is God has a plan and it's perfect. I spent too many years trying to do things my way. Now it's time to do things his way. You guys pray for me and I'll be praying for all of you. God bless. Thanks again for picking me up, dad. - Ah, no worries. Still can't believe that's all you brought. - Where I'm going, I'm not gonna need much. - I guess you got that right, are you a little hungry? - Yeah. - Well, let's go get something to eat. - Okay. - You know, I almost didn't answer the phone when you called. - I wouldn't have blamed you if you hadn't. I did some terrible things to you and mom and everybody. I'm sorry, dad. - When you called and asked for a ride to prison, I thought sure you were drunk again. - I could see why. - You sure you wanna do this, turn yourself in? - I am. I'm submitting myself to God's will now, not my own. - Proud of you son. - Thanks dad. - Let me buy you a real meal. - Sounds good. - Fill that out and turn it back in. Hi. - I'm here to turn myself in for a warrant. - Spelling on the last name. - HIGHBERGER. Highberger, Scott. - Get some back up here to the front desk. (door opening) Sir, stay right there, don't move. - Sir, turn around, hands behind your back. - Mr. Highberger, I'm Levi Watts, your attorney. - Pleasure. - This is a first, I've never been hired by a church on a criminal proceeding before. - They're a great group of people. - Okay, let's get to it. I think our best defense is to plead not guilty. Then ask for a reduced bond until you're trial, while we're waiting I can. - I'm gonna plead guilty. - I'm sorry. - I'm guilty. I did all the things that they're accusing me of. So I'm guilty. - Scott, with your record, pleading guilty would ensure. I know, I know, I've done a lot of terrible things in my life and now it's time to pay for it. - Well, I don't think the church is going to paying me just to help put you back by it's bars. It|s okay. - We're gonna put it in God's hands now. - Well, that's good because if you plead guilty, it's certainly out of mine. - I know. - All right, we'll offer them a year and see if they bite, but don't hold your breath. - It's okay. (door buzzing) - [Officer 2] Highberger, you're up. - Good luck, preacher boy. - All rise, court is now in session. The honorable judge, William Palmer presiding. - Please be seated in the case of the state of Florida versus Scott Highberger, counselor, am I to understand your client has made it known he wishes to enter a plea of guilty? - He does your honor. - Is he aware of the ramifications venting such a plea? - He is your honor. - How refreshing, someone who's actually willing to save the taxpayer's little time and money, very well. What is the state's recommendation? Your honor, considering the extensive criminal history of the defendant, which includes numerous and violent felonies, the state recommends the maximum of 20 years on each count to run consecutively. - What does he mean by that, to run consecutively? You means one after another. - Your honor. - He'll be in jail for the rest of his life. Yes counsel. - I know. - Before judgment is entered, the defense would request that his honor be made aware of several letters and statements that have been made on behalf of the accused. They address the changed nature of my client, that we pray the court would take into consideration. - Very well. As long as we don't turn this into an all day affair. - Thank you, your honor. - Anytime we were dispatched to a call involving Scott Highberger, we knew we were in for a fight, but now I can honestly say he's a changed man. Now we love seeing him walk into the Sheriff's department. - Scott is one of the few Christians I identified as being serious concerning his walk with God. My interactions and communications with him showed me his love of the Lord was real. And I believe him, I believe him to be a changed man. - Scott has become so instrumental to our church. I don't know how we ever get along without him or how we will get along without him. - Scott is absolutely wonderful, been a real role model for my children. I don't know what we do without him. - Judge, I gotta tell you that Scott growing up, he wasn't a good kid and he got progressively worse as the years went by, caused me a lot of grief and a loss of sleep. There was even a time, God forgive me, but I prayed that the next cruiser to pull in the drive was there to tell me, Scott's never coming home. But now, now I'm proud to call him my son. I love you, Scott. - Scott has reached thousands of inmates with his prison ministry, it's just simply astounding. And your honor, I have hundreds of letters here on Scott's behalf. If it's okay, I would love to just read a few. Thanks to Scott and the prison ministry, I finally see the opportunity to forgive myself and feel the light and love of Jesus Christ. Scott has been a real inspiration to me. I admire that he had the strength to walk away from his old life. He has the kindness to welcome his old friends into his new life, but the courage to stay away from them if they want to drag him down to his old place. Here's another one, your honor. I've been down 13 years when I was 11 years old, I was in a graveyard and read these words on a stone, where you are, I once was, where I am, you'll soon be. I've never forgotten those words. I want what Scott has. If it had not been for Scott, I would still be on the streets, getting into trouble. Scott showed me a brand new way to live life. No more drugs, no more crime. I'm alive today because of him. I am what Scott was and he is what I want to be. And that's just a few again, from the hundreds of letters that we received, nothing further, your honor. - Would you please bring me the defendant's criminal history? - Thank you. - Quite the checkered past. I have one question for you son. Since you've been spending all this time preaching behind bars, telling people to accept responsibility for their actions, why have you not taken care of this warrant? - Just be honest. - I was scared your honor. - I guess I was just hoping that it would go away so that I wouldn't be held accountable. - This court will take a short recess while I weigh my decision on sentencing. Mr Highberger, earlier I asked you why you had not taken care of this outstanding warrant here in the state of Florida. Your answer plain and simple was that you were afraid. You do realize that Jonah felt the same, yes? He didn't want to go to Ninivah, So God sent a giant whale to swallow him up and drag him there. I sir am your giant whale. I hold in my hand a plea agreement you have signed, offering to do 14 months in prison. The state wants you to do considerably more. I cannot in good conscience accept your terms, Mr. Highberger. This court has the authority to either accept or reject any negotiated pleas. And I have elected to not accept this one. So if you mean to move forward with your plea, I want you to know I am not going to have my hands tied. Gonna ask you one more time. Do you still wish to enter a guilty plea? - Your honor, may I confer with my client? - Of course. - What's going on? - He's rejected our plea agreement. You need to know, know that if you plead guilty, you're basically signing a blank check. - Mr. Highberger. ♪ Every page before was a record was a failure ♪ ♪ I was on my knee and you ♪ - I am guilty, your honor. ♪ My plea ♪ - Very well, the court accepts your plea of guilty. Saul was a pretty dreadful human being until he finally saw the light. Then he did some mighty fine work while he was behind bars. I think you have too, and can continue to do so. I've been on the bench now for a number of years and mostly it's business as usual. Your case though is unique. You have made some bad decisions in your life which have led you here. In your case however, I don't think incarceration is the right answer. If you're behind bars, you may reach a few people, but not nearly as many as you would as a free man. God has plans for you son. So go make them happen, this case is dismissed.
