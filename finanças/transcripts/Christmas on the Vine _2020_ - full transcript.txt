♪ ♪ ♪ I'm very impressed, Brooke. This is quite the holiday treat. I just wanted to take my boss and my friend to dinner to say thank you for this past year. Yes, that's the one. I should be taking you. Oh, I'm sure it's fine. You've created some very successful campaigns for our company this season without a break. At least allow me to make the toast. Thank you. Here's to your first 12 months and the next with our little marketing operation. Cheers. Like Christmas in a glass. Such a special time of year, isn't it? Oh, I love Christmas. All the small town traditions. I always thought of you as more of a big city type. Where I grew up you cut down your own tree and all the kids gather around the window displays on main street and the whole town turns out for a Christmas tree lighting ceremony to kick off the season. You make it sound idyllic. It is. Hot chocolate, snow angels, a huge Christmas fair. Sarah, I could really use that right now. I wanna get back. I want an old-fashioned Christmas like the kind my sister and I shared as kids. I hear you just signed a new client. A winery in eastern Washington? Lockwood crest family vineyards, yes. They're in serious trouble. Absolutely desperate for a new marketing campaign by Christmas. Well, that's where I was raised. Columbia river valley. I know it well. I know the people. I can help them and re-live the Christmas from my childhood. I've seen their sales figures. This won't be easy. Sarah, I can do it. Please? I really need this. Well then... It's yours. Really? Merry Christmas, Brooke. Merry Christmas. Thank you. ♪ Kelly, hi, it's your sister. Surprise! I'm coming home for the holidays and I cannot wait to see you and your beautiful family.

Well now, we can put that in the back seat. Excuse me. Welcome to Lockwood family crest. Hi. I have a meeting with Evelyn Lockwood. That'd be my mom. My name's Tyler. Brooke Sherman. You still work here? Still? Uh... You don't remember me. There's no reason you should, I was two years behind you in school. Oh, yeah, no, I remember- no, you don't. No, I don't. Um, Brooke you said? Mr. Lockwood? My wine? You have a customer. I'll be right with you, ma'am. She's down in the chapel tasting room. It's by the vineyards along the path. Oh, great. Thank you. I'll find it. Ok. Bye. I have a few questions. I mean, people will want to know about this. So, oh yes, number one. I see a lot of people on TV sniffing corks. Evelyn: This was a chapel my father-in-law built with his own hands for his wedding day. We converted it to a tasting room when we renovated a while back. We spent so much money. The house, the production rooms, everything. Well, it really looks beautiful, Mrs. Lockwood. Evelyn, please. I had hoped that the investment would help business but it didn't. In point of fact it got worse. People just aren't buying our wines the way they used to and if we can't fix things soon, well... What does your distributor say? We used to be with one of the big ones but we lost him to kilgore wines. They're taking over the whole valley. We are waiting to hear back from multiple distributors, we have high hopes. We need to rebrand you as a destination winery. It's not only about the wine but the whole experience. Create a little buzz. You are a family friendly business. I do like the way that sounds. Whatever we do it has to be by Christmas. Any reason for that deadline? We just need to see some real progress, and soon. Some light at the end of the tunnel. Did I hear you're from the area? Yeah, I grew up here. My parents moved to Arizona but my sister still lives in town. Kelly Sherman? Kelly baker now? She teaches music at the elementary school. It's a small town but not that small, I guess. Evelyn, have you ever thought about sprucing up for the holidays? Me, or the room? [laughs] ok, well of course we need to focus on more the decor, but it's a place to start. If we bring some real Christmas to the winery, customers are sure to follow. Yes. Oh, I am feeling very good about hiring your firm. Won't Tyler be surprised. He doesn't know? I just wanted to be sure first. Still, I know my son. He'll be fine with it. So I assume you'll be staying with your sister? No, I wanted to be close to work so I checked into the bed and breakfast on my way into town. With all the space we have here? Nonsense. You drive back over there right this minute, get your things, we'll settle you in. That is such a nice offer, but- no argument. We're family here at family crest. It says so right in the name. Well, ok. Thank you. That didn't take long. Is everything alright? Absolutely. Evelyn will fill you in. What's the big mystery? I have to get back to town but looks like we're going to be working together. What? We're gonna... What? Talk to your mom. Nice to see you again, Tyler. Yeah, you too. A whole new marketing plan? Mom, can we really afford that right now? We can't afford not to. Well, I know that, but... We're running out of options, ty. Yeah. ♪ ♪ Christmas is near ♪ ♪ Christmas is just 'round the corner ♪ ♪ he's almost here ♪ merry Christmas, kids. Word to the wise. Enjoy every minute of it. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. ♪ ... Christmas is just 'round the corner. ♪ ♪ don't forget your change. And merry Christmas. You too. Thank you. Brooke? It's Lila Garrett. Lila, it's so good to see you. Do you work at the gallery still? Better, I own it now. Come on, mommy! Grace, wait for mommy! If you're here for a while drop in for a visit. I'd love to catch up. That sounds great. Mommy! Sorry, gotta run. No, I get it. So cute. Hi. Jack Matheson, right? Yes, uh, how can I help you? I checked into your dad's bed and breakfast this morning but my plans have changed. I just picked up my bags but he wasn't there and I was hoping I could leave these with you. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Oh, the Christmas fair. That was one of my favourite traditions as a kid. Every Christmas eve. Is that why you're in town? One of the reasons. I mean, I wouldn't miss it. The fair and old friends. Can I offer you something? I've got hot apple cider brewing. It's perfect for a cold day like this. I'd love some. It's coming right up. It's like I never left. Merry Christmas. If you're interested in wine I can recommend this. I had some errands in town and I saw you duck in here. "wine" by Tyler Lockwood. Clever title. Well, I think it paints a pretty accurate picture. So you're an author. One book. I hear Hemingway started with one book. Could be a rumor though, don't quote me on that. That's probably it for me, one and done. I did not see this on display at the winery. It kind of feels like bragging. You wrote it to sell it, right? And if it highlights your business... You guys do need me. Your mom didn't tell you, huh? No. No. She does this sort of thing all the time. Last spring, for example, I came home only to find that we were now raising pygmy goats. Which lasted all of a week. Uh, not that I'm comparing you to goats, of course. Thanks for clarifying. Seriously. We're counting on you to help us out, or at least to point us in the right direction. With a product like yours that won't be a problem. Cider's up. Oh. I'll take this, too. It comes highly recommended. Please, my treat. Compliments of the author. You will not get rich like that. Wasn't on my bucket list, anyway. Mmm. This cider is amazing. So do you have some time? Maybe we can grab a bite. You know, if we're gonna be working together it might be nice to get to know each other. Sure. The diner is good. Great burgers. Works for me. Diner? Already on my Christmas list. It used to be my old spot. Well hey, in a town this size it's everybody's old spot. True. Thanks, jack. Merry Christmas. ♪ I forgot how big these things are. And so messy. Wow. It's a nice change from seafood, I imagine. That's mostly what you eat on the coast, right? Oh yeah, practically every meal. It's the city ordinates. How is life in Seattle? Good. It's exactly what I was looking for when I left town after high school. Big city, big life, big career. I just thought it would be more somehow. More what, exactly? More satisfying? I don't know. I'm still figuring it out. I'm still trying to decide what I wanna do when I grow up. Have you been with the company for very long? It will be a year this Christmas. I just came off this huge marketing campaign for a footwear company, had a Cinderella theme. If the shoe fits. Very nice. It's cute. It was. It was great. We had all these models dressed as princesses at all the outlet stores trying on heels and flats and flip-flops. Obvious, but social media went wild for it. I bet. It got people talking. So tell me about you. There's not a lot to tell. You know, I'm still here and carrying on the Lockwood family tradition. And now that's in jeopardy. I'm so sorry. Thanks. There's just too much competition with a bigger company that keeps buying up all the smaller wineries. Kilgore wines. Your mom told me. And you guys are one of the last hold-outs. Good for you. Here's the deal. You teach me about wine and I will teach you how to market it. Together I have no doubt we can turn this around. I don't know what it is but when you say it, I believe you. Have you always been this sure of yourself? Only when I know I'm right. Here you go. -Thank you. -Thank you. Waitress: You're welcome. Oh, please. No, I got it. It's a business expense. Are you sure? I'm sure. See? We're a great team already. So how does it feel being back? You can't imagine. I had a really wild year. What I needed more than anything was a hometown Christmas. The kind of holiday I had as a kid. Right. Some comfort food for the soul. Yes. Oh, like the tree. Ah, I guess I missed the lighting ceremony, huh? My family and I used to make a whole evening out of it every year. Yeah, well they haven't done that for a few years now. So many of the boutique wineries were bought out that a ton of people left and I guess the new businesses don't care as much. Oh, no, no. Don't tell me that. No band? No children's choir? They flip a switch and call it Christmas now. [sighs] Brooke. Kelly! Why didn't you call me back? I've been so busy with the school play and I had to run these errands. Tyler Lockwood, my sister, Kelly. The music teacher. [laughs] hi. Hi. Uh, brooke's working with us over at the winery. Lockwood crest? Oh yeah, sure. That's... That's still open? And going strong. Spread the word. We are launching an exciting new marketing campaign. Well, hooray for you being home. It's been way too long. I know, entirely my fault. I... I got really caught up in work this year. I know, it's not an excuse. I'm determined to fix it this visit. How's my nephew? How's Michael? He's great. He's getting taller every day. He's at home with Scott, his dad, so I can do some Christmas shopping. I can't wait to see him. Just give me a few days to get settled. Well, ok. I still have to get to some stores before they close. It was lovely to meet you, Tyler. You too. Merry Christmas, sis. Ok. -Love you. -Love you. Bye. See? That's what I've been missing. I bet it feels like Christmas now. It really does. It also feels like a very long day. Yeah. So where are you staying? I can walk you back if you like. That would be quite a walk. I'm actually parked up the street so I'll drive myself. Sure. I'll see you in the morning. What's all this? Another meeting? No, not a meeting. I'm... I'm checking in. What- Evelyn insisted I stay here. Here, here? At the house? Your mom doesn't really take no for an answer. Have you ever noticed that? Yeah, every single day of my life. [laughs] let me help you with those. Oh, I got it. Please. I insist. No. Really, it's ok. Thank you. Hi. Hi, Evelyn. Welcome back. Your home is beautiful. Look who I ran into in town. Hi mom. The guest rooms are on the second floor, last door on your right. Show her, Tyler. And help the girl with her luggage. Is that how I raised you? See? Now you got me in trouble. Ok, I'll allow it. You make yourself at home. Thank you so much. Any other surprises I should know about? Nothing you should know about. I can take it from here. Thanks. So what's the plan? Up and at 'em bright and early form now 'til Christmas. That sounds like quite the holiday. It will be. Just you wait. ♪ wow. Is this what a marketing exec does? This is just window dressing. The real work began last night. Researching your competition, updating your website. Which reminds me, we've got to talk about your social media. What social media? Exactly. Hey, I need to grab another tree for that corner. You wanna run out to mr. Buckles' farm? We can chop it down ourselves, we used to do it every year when I was a kid. It's really fun. Well, that would be a great idea if it were still there. Kilgore wineries bought it. It's levelled to make room for more vineyards. [sighs] big business strikes again. Yeah. It's such a shame. I'll figure something out. In the meantime, I reached out to all the gourmet magazines, the food and wine critics. It's all about name recognition, you know, what sets the lockwood label apart. Well, as long as we don't lose what got us this far, right? We have a lot of memories wrapped up in these vineyards. You should check out upstairs sometime. That's where mom keeps the entire lockwood family history. See? That's what we're selling. The feeling of family. Your family. I have a lot of memories in this valley, too. Local vineyards in the summer. I even had a job one year stomping their grapes. Hey, we all used to do that. That is, before the machines took over. My feet were purple for weeks. They called me "grape ape" in the locker room. [laughs] see, I was smarter. I never took my socks off. That's nice. So how much do you know about wine? Let's pretend I know nothing. 'cause you don't. Show me all the stuff about wine. Ok. Let us start with a tasting then, shall we? Now, that I know quite a lot about. -We'll see. -Great. Oh, can I look at the label? I just want to see the vintage. Sure. Why? I just want to make sure you didn't crush these grapes with your feet. -[laughs] -we're good. So proper. Always. There's no other way to- woah, woah not- not so fast. There's an entire art to this. Oh. So first, down low by the stem, we start by looking. So we raise our glasses up to the light and we check the clarity. Next, flat on the table, a good swirl. And you're gonna look at the patterns on the side of the- maybe try to keep it in the glass. Oh, like that's never happened to you. Never. Ok, now what? We sniff. Sniff? Just a couple short ones. It tickles my nose a little. Well, it should. See, the finer wines satisfy all the senses, not just taste. Now, if you'd like, go ahead and sip. But do not swallow. [mouthful] I don't swallow? Mmm-mmm. You're going to swish and spit. [mouthful] spit it out? Yeah. After you swish. It aerates the wine. Uh, hits all the taste buds. The flavours bloom though, right? Actually, yeah. Wow, that's kind of amazing. Now what? I say we drink. Don't have to ask me twice. So, aside from saving our humble winery, what's on your agenda this christmas? Well, I had a whole list of things I wanted to do when I was home but so much has changed. The tree farm, the lighting ceremony downtown. Has anyone moved any mountains yet? Why do you ask? My parents got kelly and me sleds for christmas one year. We came out here every weekend until spring thaw. That's quite a workout. It didn't used to be. -It must be these inner tubes. -Yeah. Either that or the mountain's gotten steeper since high school. [laughs] I remember you on the football team back then. Everybody thought you might go pro. I had some chances. Some athletic scholarships if I wanted them. But that was never gonna happen. Why not? We've had the vineyard for over 50 years. I learned the trade and the business directly from my father and my grandfather. Now it's my turn. Ah. I'm sure that's what they expected but what did you want? The same thing. Lockwood family crest. -Never a doubt. -Nope. It must be comforting to know exactly what you want from life. Don't you? Not yet. I'll figure it out. For now, the mountain is waiting. Hey! Where are you going? If I knew we were racing I would have stretched first! ♪ alright, we're gonna get serious about this. Oh, here are our official santa hats. Ok. No, no, no. It's not my rule, it's in the christmas handbook. Article two, section seven. Yeah, no. Uh, you're setting yourself up for a big fine if they catch you. Well, I, hey- what are you- woo! ♪ ♪ slipping and sliding on a frozen pond ♪ last one to the bottom is a summer snowman! Woo!

You know what would look really beautiful? White christmas lights all throughout the vineyard, just a whole hillside of them. It's pretty perfect in its natural splendour, isn't it? Sure, but I think it would just really brighten everything up. It would get people out here. Hi. I was in the neighbourhood and I thought I'd stop in and see if you'd given any thought to my offer. Brooke sherman, this is carla kilgore. She and her company own most of the valley these days. Ok, so you're the one. Oh, you've been talking about me, tyler? Should I be flattered? The mom and pop places are struggling. I'm trying to help. So eliminating the competition is a sort of charity work? Lockwood family crest is a family business. We're still not gonna sell. The choice is yours. I've just seen the numbers and they don't lie. So the offer's on the table 'til midnight christmas eve. It's here before you know it. I'll see you next week. At the fair committee. Merry christmas. Merry christmas. So that's the christmas deadline. Would you guys ever consider selling? Never. We lockwoods never give up. I like your attitude.

It's hard to believe this is a work space. Chandeliers? Yeah, they were a gift from dad to mom years ago. Christmas. I love that. There's so much family history here, I mean everywhere you look. You seem awfully appreciative of family history. It's kind of everything, isn't it? Even these wreathes. My sister and I used to make them together every year. We'd use evergreen clippings and berries. Discount store decorations. Whatever we had on hand. On that note, what do you think of this? It's not bad. A little more holly and maybe tuck in an ornament right in there. How many of these are we making, again? Enough to fill your truck bed. And on each one of them we're going to put one of these.

I just wanna say I think it's so great that the proceeds are going back into the community and if anyone needs a volunteer, I'm your girl. That's so nice of you. I don't wanna brag but I did win the stuffed elf toss two years in a row. Eighth and ninth grade. Do you guys remember the hay ride? The children's choir, so cute. And my grandmother's cookies? This presentation is going to be a little more of a grown-up presentation, you know? Art seminars, wine tastings, not so much the elf toss. But it'll still be a family event, I mean, I can't imagine the children attending a seminar. Well, we're trying to bring this fair into the next century, you know? Cultivate a more sophisticated image. And you're all good with that? Carla's winery, carla's rules. Carla: Ok. Let me tell you what's going to be on the catering menu. I mean, what's she thinking?

What about an evening of cookie and wine pairing? Would anyone actually come to that? Of course they would. Especially with the right cookies. My grandmother's. Those really say christmas to me. Do you have the recipes? No, but I know where to get them. Ok. Cheers. [clink] oh! Ok, so we need all of this done by lunchtime so I can get the kids on the set to rehearse. Ok. Hey, michael, could you hand me that big present? -Ok mom. -Thanks buddy. Rick was gonna help us paint the trees but his wife needs him today. It couldn't wait? Well, I suppose he could but she couldn't. They're having a baby. Oh. Oh! Ok, thank you. I'll uh, I'll go hang up my outfit and see who else is here. Thank you. Oh, it looks great! So festive! -Hi! -Hi. Was that principal carmichael? Yes. Yes, it was. Some things never change, huh? Like me directing this pageant. It's all I have time for these days. So what is all this? Is it santa's workshop? It will be with another coat of paint. Michael, look who's here. -Michael! -Hi aunt brooke! Hi! I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you yet. Your mom was telling me that you're getting so tall. Actually, I'm average for my age but we're expecting a growth spurt in a couple of years. Good to know. [laughs] ok, off you go, back to the presents. You know, if you guys need some help, uh, I'm pretty good with a paint brush. Yes, please. That would be great. Hey, michael? Can you please show tyler what needs painting? He's going to help. Ok. Yeah. Thank you. I was hoping we could chat but you seem really busy. No, please. I could use the break. -Yeah? -Yeah. Ok, kids. Just keep doing what you're doing. Just with more cheer. Huh? Merry, merry! Let's go to the break room. So what's up? Ok, I'm working on an event and I need some really great christmas cookie recipes. I was thinking grandma sherman's? Oh, they were the best. Do I have those? Oh, maybe I do have those... In a box somewhere at home. Oh, when do you need them by? Tomorrow. I know you have so much going on. Say no more. I should have about an hour between this and the show and if I can find them, I will bring them tonight. Thank you. You're a lifesaver. I can't wait to see it all come together. Oh, it's so cute, isn't it? Michael is so happy you're here. Hey, look at me! I'm an airplane! Oh, that's not good. Joey! Joey, get down from that ladder! Hey! Yeah. Careful. There we go. Tyler: A little help? It's not very easy to see. Tyler, you are doing great. Just put it over here by the window. Just follow my voice. Oh, watch the chair. Here we go. This tree is gorgeous. It's from a lot in town. It's not your tree farm but I think it'll do. I mean, the shape and the size, it really doesn't get much more perfect than this. Just imagine it with lights and ornaments. The lights are here, uh, the ornaments are where? In the garage. You deal with that tangle and I'll get the rest. How is it that every year I put these away in neat little coils and still they come out like this? It's a christmas mystery. Part of the fun. Actually, one of the traditions I've been missing. Oh, you miss this? Mmmhmm. Ok, if you say so, but this is one christmas tradition I'm willing to pass on. [laughs] uh, what time's the show tonight? Are you sure you don't mind going? Of course not. I've got a big stake in this production. Some of my finest painting is up on that stage and I promised your nephew. Michael's a great kid. He really is. My sister has it all. That family, a job she loves. Here I thought I was the lucky one, going to college and being so independent, chasing my dreams. Well, I mean, it looks from here like you've got it made. What could be missing? A relationship eventually, and a career I can fall in love with. So not marketing? Marketing is the first thing that has felt like a good fit. Do I wanna do it forever? I don't know. Here's the first bunch. Tyler, I just saw the mail truck pull up. Do you mind checking while brooke and I start on these? Sure thing. We didn't get very far. [laughs] alright then. I regret to inform you... Changing markets. Evelyn, you have so many beautiful ornaments. My husband was a collector. Really? Yeah. Oh, this one has been on my tree every year since I married tyler's father. It was a christmas wedding, did you know? That's lovely. Most all of these have stories to tell. Oh, what about this one? That is a family heirloom. Tyler's grandfather painted that the very first year he had the vineyard. So special. [door opens, closes] oh, no tyler, what's wrong? Another distributor has rejected us. And in the form letter of all things. It's not the end of the world. Well, it might be the end of ours. Carla's offer only extends until christmas eve. Either we accept it or we risk foreclosure. And they get the property from the bank at a big discount. Won't there be distributors at the fair? If they taste your wine you never know. Only the hosting winery can supply the wine. It's one of the reasons that carla took over the fair this year. Ok, then we'll focus on online sales. And for customers who visit I have an idea for a sip and ship promotion. They try it, they like it, we take it from there. The easier we make it for them- stop. Please. I mean- fancy decorations and free shipping aren't going to save us right now. We still have time to attract another distributor. Or what do you suggest? Selling out? Giving up? What other choice do we have? Hey. Hey. Are you ok? Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I just- I look out there and I see myself at five or six tagging along by my grandfather, picking grapes in the summer heat. My dad's nearby, he's planting new vines. Worrying about too much water, or not enough. Three generations. Three generations of lockwoods are counting on me, brooke. We will find a solution. Yeah, but you can't promise that. No, I can't. But I can try. This place is everything to me. It's all that I am. It's family. Speaking of family, I have to get going for the pageant. I'll tell kelly and michael why you can't make it. No, no, no, there's no way I'm missing that. You still wanna go? Yes. I promised michael. You are so good with kids. I'm surprised you haven't settled down and had some of your own by now. Ah. Well, if it happens, it happens. I've got the winery, the vineyards. So for now, at least, I think that's enough. I don't know why enough has never been enough for me. It just always feels like there's something better waiting over the horizon or around the bend. But you miss out on a lot of life that way, don't you? Appreciate today. That's what my grandfather taught me. And then you just sorta let tomorrow take care of itself. Smart man. Yeah. So I guess now all I can do is trust that. Hmm. [instrumental version of "deck the halls"] ♪ ok, alright. Oh, cher, frankie, joey, come away from the curtain. Come on. Ok. Everyone, come over, I need your attention. Everyone, we're gonna sit down. Shh. Alright, thank you, everyone. Ok, principal carmichael is playing pretend santa this year. Now, we need your attention, ok? Ok, we went over your lines this afternoon. Does anybody have any questions? Yes, cher, you have a question? I don't remember my line. Oh, that's ok. Let me see. You walk up to santa and you say you want new wings for christmas. You want new- no, no, no. You say "I want new wings for christmas". "I want new wings". You want new wings, too? Ok. The magic of theatre, somehow it all magically comes together. Hey, uh, I don't see michael. Oh yeah, he's the little christmas tree. He's right... You do what you need to do here, we will find him. Ok? Thank you. Ok, so we're gonna stay here and we're gonna be nice and quiet. Michael, is that you in there? It's me. I'm a tree. You gotta get out there, bud. It's almost showtime. I don't think I can do it. Sure you can. Do you remember what you're gonna say? What you're gonna ask santa? Yes. I want the star on top to shine all through christmas. It's dumb. Hey, it's not dumb. It's a great line. It's for the audience, anyway. They're gonna eat it up. Santa's depending on you. You know that's not really santa, right? Right, because the real santa is getting ready for christmas eve. Do we need to have a talk? Michael, you're an actor. Your job is to convince the audience that that santa is the real deal. That won't be easy. Everybody knows principal carmichael. The most important thing is that you know in your heart that everything will work out if you believe in yourself. Do you think you can do that? Yes, maybe if I improvise a little. Thanks, aunt brooke! Wow. You ever think about coaching football? You're a natural. I'm not ruling anything out. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry christmas, little angel. Do you know what santa wonders? He wonders what you want under your tree this year. Most of all, you want- I want new wings for christmas! Ho, ho, ho! That is a good wish! We'll see what santa can do about that. [crowd laughs] there you are, dear. Take a bow. [applause] oh, and you, my favourite christmas tree. What do you want from santa this year? I would like a star on top, up here, that shines all through christmas and to light up the whole world! Ho, ho, ho, ho! [applause] isn't that- take a bow. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

Brooke? Seriously? Keep going. You're doing great. I'm- adorable, both of you. Like a christmas card. Well, now I know how michael felt in his tree costume. Tyler, this is a family business. You're the face of it. Carla's company cannot compete with a personal touch like this. And the big distributors in portland and seattle will eat this up. I'm serious. Ok, ok. It's kinda hard to take you seriously in this get up, you know? I told you, christmas really brings out the elf in me. Literally, this year. The elf has a point. And not just her ears. You're spreading christmas cheer. Yeah, so keep spreading it. Ok, ready? Action! Uh, sorry. That's your job. Yep. Won't happen again. Glad you're here. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry christmas! This is santa saying stop by lockwood family winery for cookies and wine this christmas for a special family event. Ugh! ♪ then we mix in the dry ingredients and before you know it... Voila. We've got dough. Doesn't this bring back so many memories? All that time with grandma in the farmhouse kitchen. Alright, who wants to roll them out? Oh, have rolling pin, will roll. Excellent. Oven at 375. That is me. Check. Can I taste? Woah, woah, woah. Not until we're done, buddy. But what you can do is be on cookie cutter duty. Pick whichever one you like. I like the reindeer. Oh, excellent choice. Anything I can do when I'm done here? Please, you've done enough. I mean, if anybody doesn't know about this event by now they're just not paying attention. And I personally contacted every distributor on the coast. Ok, so 12 more trays of these. We should be all set. Winemaker, author, baker. Is there no end to your talent? [giggles] ah. Now, we have more than enough cookies to decorate. And then can I taste? [laughter] and then you can taste. Even santa and his elves couldn't get this many done in time for tonight. Hey, come on, where's that christmas spirit that you're so famous for? Pass me the green icing, would you? Oh, um... Do you mean this green? [laughs] are you sure you don't wanna try some red? Do not start something you can't finish. Enough, alright you two. You are setting a bad example for the c-h-I-l-d. I can spell, you know. Ok, ok, back to work, people. Lot of cookies to do.

We baked them ourselves. Delicious. So now you know where michael and I were all day. That's time well spent, I'd say. Santa's jam-filled thumbprint cookies and lockwood crest pinot noir. Oh... Delicious. That's a pinot, you say? Ours is a dry red. You'll appreciate the fruit-forward character with notes of plum and black cherry. Very complex with lasting aromas on the finish. It's really one of my favourites. Mmm. This is a perfect event, brooke. And such a nice turnout, considering. Considering? The ice storm over the mountains. You didn't hear? So no one can get here from the coast? All of the passes are closed. I had a friend driving in from portland. I so wanted you two to meet. I know he would have loved this. [sighs] well, the storm stopped all the major distributors from getting here. I know, but think of everyone who did make it. They'll spread the word, like a grassroots campaign. All it takes is one right word in one right ear. Where'd you get all that information tonight? Fruit-forward notes of black cherries. Oh, you noticed that, did you? Yeah. That was from your book. You should read it sometime. You seemed right at home. Every word. We're a good fit, wine and I. Who would have guessed? There's something really appealing about the business. Just the business? Well, the co-workers are pretty attractive, too, so that's a plus. Yeah, now that you mention it, my mom is quite the knock-out. [laughs] hey look, it's snowing. Was that in the forecast? No, it's only supposed to be up in the mountains. Reminds me of my sophomore year when it snowed the night of winter prom. I was there. What was the theme, again? -Snowfall. -Snowfall. Not a flake in the forecast all week and then midnight rolled around the band was playing and there it was... Like magic. You know, it sorta feels like magic all over again.

This is one of tyler's grandfather's notebooks. He kept track of everything. Weather, soil conditions, pruning schedules... I just remember him writing and writing and writing at the kitchen table when I was a kid. I haven't looked at these in years. Here's an original sketch of the chapel. Oh, wow. So artistic. He would have loved you, brooke. Hmm. You know, there could be something in here we could use as promotion. Some family history that might give us a hook. Do you mind if I read it? Not at all. If there's something to be had, have at it. Great. Anything interesting in there? Maybe something about a buried treasure? [small laugh] wouldn't that come in handy right about now? This is really the treasure in and of itself. New varieties, new blends. Storage. It's basically the entire lockwood family crest history. Yeah, well keep reading. I'm holding out for a map to gold bars on the back 40. Well, hello there. This could be something. Hey. Are you busy? Hi. Never for you. Mrs. Lockwood said I would find you out here. What is this chemistry experiment? I am fooling around with some of tyler's grandfather's old recipes he never got around to. There's some really interesting blends in there. It's not as hard as it looks. It's actually kind of fun. Anyone can follow the recipe. Mmmhmm. What're you doing out here? Well, now that the play is done I have time to spend with my sister and... Michael made you this. You are his favourite aunt, you know. I'm his only aunt. So cute. I just need a refrigerator and a magnet. Hmm. Thank you. I love it. You look awfully at home behind this bar here. Oh yeah? What'll it be? What're you pouring? If you're serious, try this. Oh. Ok. This is delicious. It's good, right? Is this one of these blends? Yeah, most of them are nothing special but there's something about this one. Yeah, I agree. What does tyler think? I haven't told him yet. I wanted to surprise him with it. Do you have a crush on him? [laughs] this is excellent. We should drink to this. We should. 3a, anyone? Cheers. Well, isn't this a sherman sisters christmas card? Oh, we were just talking about you. Oh? You know what I think? We should all get together. Maybe it'll make up for the fair. The christmas fair? What do you mean? Yeah, what- what about it? It was cancelled this morning. Uh, something about kilgore wineries' new expansion not passing city inspection. You don't know. So she just called it off? Can she do that? It's her valley these days. The rest of us, I guess, just live in it. She didn't grow up here. She doesn't understand what this fair means to us. I mean, it's been a part of our christmas every year since we were kids. I know, the whole town's upset. At least, everyone I've talked to, but what can we do? We can move it out here. Brooke, I don't- I don't- I am serious. We move it out here and we make it the fair we remember. Right, but an event of that size it takes city approvals, and with only two days I'm afraid there's just not enough time. No, maybe there is. I know all of those officials. I've taught their kids and they were relying on the fair, too. Can you make some calls? I can. Guys, with everything going on right now I'm just not sure that this should be our focus. This should absolutely be the focus. What better way to attract a national distributor? The excitement, the energy. If we move the fair here we are the hosts, and if we are the hosts we supply the wine, and if we supply the wine, the wine will be all: Lockwood family crest. What better promotion? Let's make those calls. Thank you all for showing up on such short notice. Look, the fair's off. Don't we all have better things to do? Well, it's only off because you didn't pass inspection. Tyler, you know about building permits. One little thing... Half a dozen little things is what we hear. Either way, I don't have time to get them fixed. I'm disappointed, too. I know. And that's why we're suggesting, tyler and I, that we host the fair. Move it out to lockwood family crest. Why didn't we think of that? The whole community is looking forward to it, and my friend can finally meet you. Well, it's- it's too late. You still have to get approval from the city. Yes, actually... We're all set. So we could cancel the fair for the first time in 50 years or we could spread the word, let people know that we're moving it down the road a few miles. And we can make it the fair we all remember. All the events, all the family fun. We can really bring christmas back to the valley. Isn't it worth a vote? Hey, not so fast. As chair I'm the only one who can do that. Well, then I move that you do that. Ok then, um... Provided the papers are in order. Oh, they are. Who all is in favour of moving the venue to the lockwood family crest? Several: Aye. Alright, we got the fair and everyone seems happy about it. Still a lot of work to do. Yeah, but so much of it has already been arranged. All we have to do is call the band, re-route deliveries, and focus on bringing back the fun of it. Photos with santa, candy making. The- the stuffed elf toss? Obviously. Hey, do you have time for, you know, one more stop before we go back home? One last tradition? Who's? Yours? Something I wanna share with you. Sure. Hey, come on! Keep up! Ha! Ok, let's remember that this was your idea! And I don't get a lot of snowshoe practise in seattle. It's the only way to get to where we're going. Ha! Left, right, left, right. [out of breath] oh, wow. This view. Is this what you wanted to show me? Mmmhmm. It's the entire valley. I try to get out here at least once a season. Until now I really wasn't sure which one would be my favourite. Which is it? Oh, definitely winter. This winter. I can see everything down there. The town, the vineyards... My whole childhood is down there. Thank you for showing me this. It's my pleasure. I honestly can't remember enjoying a christmas as much as this one. You know I go back to seattle after the fair, right? Is that certain? It's my life. Your life is here, too. In that valley. Your friends, your family. You said it yourself. You're looking for a place that fits. A job. A relationship. Brooke, you are the most incredible woman I have ever met. Tyler, I don't wanna give you the wrong impression, it's just... Timing's not right. Are you sure? I mean, that kiss sort of tells me that- come on, we have so much work ahead of us. We need to focus. You're not helping. And I'm distracting. Ok, this is good. Excellent. Stop stalling. I'm serious. We have to get back and- and set things in motion. Ok. We will go. Hey. Sharing this? I won't forget it. One more question, though. Is there an easier way back? [laughs] like skis or a tube? Taxi, maybe? No? Oh, robert, I love that. Let's get that right by the entrance, ok? And we're gonna move the food stations closer to the venue so just check out the site map I gave you when you get a chance. Tony, that looks amazing! Let's just make sure we get the ornaments going up this way, too, alright? I'm seeing a few gaps in there. Worker: You got it. Everybody, you're doing a great job! I'm loving it! Dining tables are all set up in the aging room. I cannot wait to see it all lit up with the chandeliers. If lockwood family crest is going out, we're going out with a bang. So listen, uh, mom's just waiting back at the house, we're supposed to select our featured wine. We've got our choices down to about three. Great. Do you want to come by, join us, weigh in? Yeah, I'd love to. Awesome. Anything else I can do before I go? Oh, did the elves arrive? Elves? For the holiday elf toss. Don't worry, they're bean bags, they don't eat much. Will you help me track them down? Will do. But then we have tasting, yeah? Great. Ten minutes? I'll be there. -Alright. -Ok. So we need to make a strong impression tomorrow night and we could use another opinion. We'd love to know what you think, brooke. Seriously? What is this, a final exam or something? Something like that. Go for it. Ok. Nice body. It's dry, crisp. Not overpowering. Nice acidity. Spot on. I'm not sure about the tannins, though. A little bitter, maybe. Mmm. Great aroma. Nice texture. Oaky. I like that... Earthy, too. That's good, right? Depending on the wine, yeah. Yeah. For this one, it's very good. What about this last one? Mmm. This is very complex. It starts with the fruity undertones and then smoky overtones. I'm getting a hint of... Gummy bear? [laughs] what? She's right. Gummy bears. I think that might be my favourite. I agree. Of these, that would be my choice, as well. Tyler? Yeah. Yeah. It's good. I mean, they're all good. With carla and her friends here we need to be sure that we completely knock this out of the park. In that case... I might be overstepping, but... Do you guys mind if I suggest one? A different one? All of our best options are right here, brooke. Is it one of our wines? Sort of. It's a blend I made. That you made? I had help from a new friend. I was thinking we could call it "a christmas bordeaux". A christmas wine? Very interesting. This could be the key to the future. A new product. Something to build a whole campaign around. I started to sketch a new label. It's rough, but I think you'll like it. A new label- why would we change our label? Well, most people buy the artwork, not the wine. Oh, that's colourful, it must be good. The old label is beautiful. My grandfather designed that label. It's part of our brand and it's our history. And this keeps with your family tradition. It incorporates the old label plus the sketch of the chapel your grandfather designed. The chapel. That's something. No, it... I mean, there's enough change around here already, isn't there? Tyler, trust me. This could be the big idea we've been looking for. A launching pad for a whole series of holiday wines. Taste it, tyler. I'm not gonna taste it, mom. It's a blend. Our reputation is on the line and a blend is not going to cut it. That's a little harsh, don't you think? You don't know the business specifically, brooke. And you don't know our family like we do. It's not your fight. You're right. Absolutely right. What was I thinking? I... Brooke, I didn't mean it like that. It's a really great blend, you know. And you won't even try it. It's your grandfather's. He left it for you. He even called it "tyler's blend". What? Tyler's blend. It's in his notes. It's christmas eve. What if your grandfather just handed us the miracle we have been waiting for? -Is that the north pole? -Yeah. Great. I'll meet you outside and show you where it goes, ok? Wait... I... Brooke... I'll finish this up, but after the fair that's it. I've done what I can do. How'd it go? Not perfect. I'm not surprised, given your attitude. You really should try this. Go on. That's not bad. That's really good. Good? It's sensational. Why would she go through all this trouble? You have to ask? Ty, you know everything about wine but nothing about women. Yeah. I don't know. However this goes, I'm finishing up and heading back right after the fair tomorrow. I know it'll be late but I just wanna get home. Yeah, it's been great, but... This is tyler's life. Not mine. Well, he made it pretty clear I don't belong. Merry christmas to you, too, sis. And to scott and michael. I love you guys so much. Ok.

Tyler, I'm not ready to give up. We've come so far. If we just had a little more time. It's christmas eve. There is no more time. We take carla's offer tonight or we risk losing everything. [sighs] I'm afraid it is what it is. [small laugh] [clinks glass] um, as- as chair of this event I just wanna wish you all a merry christmas, and thank you so much for coming. Oh, and big thank you to lockwood family crest for lending us at the last minute this wonderful winery. Thank you. [applause] it's proof that good things can come in very small packages. Good things can also come in very big packages. Like kilgore wines. We're pleased to announce that we are going to continue to expand into the coming year so we can continue to support those of you who are struggling to make ends meet. And we may even have an announcement at midnight tonight. [applause] but we should hear from our host. Tyler lockwood, would you like to say a few words? [applause] thank you. Thank you all. Now, I can't even begin to put into words what an evening like this means to lockwood family crest wines, as well. Celebrating the season with our family, our dear friends, and all of you lovely neighbours. And we all know how hard it is for a modest winery like ours to survive, let alone to succeed nowadays. And so, like all of you, it is our duty and privilege to do whatever it takes... To adapt. And so, from the bottom of my heart, folks, thank you so much, thank you. [applause] this night is for you! Now drink up! Wine is on the house. You used my blend. And the label. Yeah, I had the bottlers working overtime. So you were right, brooke. I was wrong. I should probably tattoo that somewhere now. Probably. ♪ tyler, set aside a bottle of that new wine for us for our new year's party? Kelly, are you kidding? It's on the house. Thank you. Of course. -Love you. -Love you. -Bye. -Bye guys. -Goodnight. -So cute. I gotta hand it to you, tyler. This new blend is gonna make a very nice addition to my catalogue. How? Look at the time. What's your decision? Do you wanna sell? Or should I just deal with the bank come spring? There you are. I'm so sorry to interrupt, but my friend wants to meet you. The one who couldn't make the wine pairing because of the storm? Vince talbot. Tyler lockwood. Welcome. Vince talbot from portland. You're a distributor. One of the biggest. You are the friend lila wanted us to meet. Yes. Mr. Talbot, carla kilgore. You and I have traded calls for the past few weeks. Yes, we have. But I'm here to see mr. Lockwood. I'll leave you all to talk. I saw the santa commercial, and like lila said I couldn't make the cookie pairing, but I was hoping we might connect here tonight. We're all really glad that you came. Uh, the commercial, in fact, was brooke's. That was yours? It was. Very smart. I love the family angle. Thank you. Word around the industry is that you've lost your distribution deal. We can fix that. You wanna work with us? Yeah. Would you be open to discussing that? Is tomorrow soon enough? [laughs] tomorrow is christmas. Yep. The day after. If you can guarantee us at least 800 cases of that christmas blend for next year I think you've found a product that might just re-launch your winery. And from there? And from there? And from there we go national. The sky's the limit. Call me. Ok. [laughs] carla, I think I've got your answer right here. Talbot is a great businessman, and if this works out for you, well, congratulations. It almost sounds like you mean that. I've always said that this valley is big enough for everyone. I don't remember you ever saying that. Well, I'm saying it now. It's almost like we're a big family. Family is everything. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Merry christmas. [laughing] I wish you didn't have to leave. Especially christmas eve. I know, but I've been gone long enough and there's so much work waiting for me. A promotion, new accounts. Thank you both so much for the past few weeks. You can't go before opening this. It's from both of us. I didn't get you anything. You gave us our winery. We couldn't have asked santa for a better gift. Just a little something to remember us by. Your grandfather's ornament. I could not possibly accept this. Like it or not, you're family now. This is a treasure. Really, thank you. You have no idea how much I love this. Merry christmas, dear. This place isn't gonna feel the same without you. You gave me a christmas I will never forget. I mean it. Not a flake in the forecast. How about that? It's like magic again. ♪ all my life I felt like something's missing. Coming here made me realize what it is. Work I love, this feeling of family I love. And? Isn't it obvious? This is where I belong. [laughs] is that mistletoe? Merry christmas to me. Merry christmas to us. To us. [bells jingling]
