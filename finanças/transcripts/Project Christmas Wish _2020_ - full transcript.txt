This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. ♪ ♪ Hi! ♪ Mike: Good morning, Elmhurst! It's the first of December, so you know what that means! It's opening day of Project Christmas Wish! And on my show today, I have Santa's favorite elf who makes all of Elmhurst's Christmas wishes come true- Lucy Keller! Thank you, Mike, for that introduction that sets impossibly high standards. But yes, Project Christmas Wish begins today. So, come by Be Home Design to make a wish. And listeners, remember, there is no ask too big for Project Christmas Wish. That's true. Because I believe where there's a wish, there's a way. Thanks, Lucy. We'll be back after these messages. Uh, new slogan? Yeah. I'm trying it out. It was either that or "Your Christmas wish is my panic, anxiety, and insomnia." I thought the first one had a little more of a ring to it. Yeah, I agree. See you later at the store? - Well, that depends. Are you gonna bulldoze me into buying another dozen kids' Christmas toys this year? Of course I'm not going to bulldoze you. I'm going to guilt you. - Even better. Yay. - Merry Christmas, Mike! - Mike: Merry Christmas! - (chuckling) ♪ Joan: Hey! How'd it go? I've been waiting to hear your voice. I appreciate the support, but the promo doesn't air until 9:00 AM. Ah. So, I have some news. (gasping) Don't tell me. You got the gig for the Victorian on Pine? You mean we did, but yes. They called me last night. The owners wanna completely redecorate. It's a huge job! And speaking of huge jobs, I did not think you could go more overboard than last year, but somehow you have proved me wrong. Overboard? This was nothing. Lucy, I watched you work on this 24/7 for a week, barely sleeping. Which, by the way, how do you look so well rested? Oh, you know. Just a potentially lethal amount of caffeine. - Hi, girls! - Hi, Mom. Hey, Joyce. Ooh, is that my new dress? I custom made her a dress for today. She's gotta look her best for the press. As do you. After all, you are half of Project Christmas Wish. Oh, you flatter me. But I'm an assistant elf at best. (giggling) You don't like it? Um, it's an elf costume. You said elf! No, I said "elf-inspired". As in a Prada-esque nod to an elf. Like a classy elf out on the town or a chic elf off to the board room. This is more Christmas in Middle Earth. But... so appreciated. And, of course I'll wear it. You don't have to. No, I'm excited to wear it. It's... fun. Good. Okay! I'm off to the shop. Lots of holiday alterations to do. We'll see you girls later. - All right. - Bye, Mom! - Bye. Wow. It's... so...fun! I guess you can never have too much Christmas. I've just had enough Christmas. Why is that so terrible? It's not so terrible, honey. It's just that it's only December 1st. Yeah, I know, and it feels like the holiday season will never end. Lucas, look we know that you miss Stephanie. (sighing) And that just makes the holidays harder. But this could be an opportunity to remember her. - Mm-hm. - Keep her close. And also, Max wants a real Christmas. Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa! Hey! Max-Max! Mmm! Hey, look what we brought. Fresh-made doughnuts! Grandpa even drew Christmas trees on them for you. Ooh. Thank you! Hey! No, Ma'am. (whispering) I'll save you one. Good morning, Daddy. Good morning. Come here. (wheezing voice) Big hug! - Too big. - (chuckling) Daddy, can we get our Christmas tree today? Um, you know, I think the Christmas tree lot might be a little busy today. Why don't we... why don't we wait a bit? Why don't you start your breakfast, here you go, and I'll be right over there. And next time, ask me before bringing doughnuts for Max's breakfast. It's the holidays! Mike on Radio: I have Santa's favorite elf who makes all of Elmhurst's Christmas wishes come true. Lucy: Thank you, Mike. Come by Be Home Design to make a wish. (music playing) (radio shutting off) Daddy, can we go downtown today? Sure. What? You have doughnut sugar on your lip. Is it right there? Okay, you can have one doughnut, but finish your eggs first. Reporter: So, tell us about your Christmas wish. Well, last year, Project Christmas Wish brought me Elvis here, which changed my life. 'Cause of Elvis I feel like myself again. Reporter: That's amazing. So, what will you wish for this year? Woman: Well, you know, I actually don't think I need anything... Mike. Here to make Christmas wishes come true again? Oh, my goodness. Each ornament was made by a child with a hope for a special toy beneath their Christmas tree. That's a lot of toys! That's a lot of happy children. Hmm. - Thank you. - Okay. The shopping list is inside and I'll see you tomorrow morning on air. Great. Wonderful. Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas! - (chuckling) Yeah. Right. - Can we get a few words? - No comment. Oh! Hi, Cullen. Don't your trees look great in here? - Where's Joan? - She's around here somewhere. Why, what's going on? There's something important I need to... Hi, honey! Hi! Darling. - Hi. - Hi. I have some trees to sell. Okay. Your boyfriend's being weird. Yeah. Yeah, that's part of his charm. Lucy, time for a quick interview? Oh, great. Lemme just find my mom to join us. Perfect. ♪ Daddy, can we go in there? Man in background: Merry Christmas. I have a surprise for you, but you can't see. So, can you go over there? Sure, just don't talk to strangers. And be safe, okay? Okay, Dad. It's "Daddy". When did I become Dad? Excuse me. Are you in charge? Ooh, I don't know if I'm in charge, but I oversee Project Christmas Wish. Do you wanna make a wish? (giggling) Okay. Just think about what would make you happier than anything else in the world. Write it on this card, pop it in the box, and we'll do the rest. - Thank you! - You're welcome. Can I help you with something? Uh, no thank you. Actually, yes! Um, what's up with all the horses? Oh. It's the Elmhurst Christmas Horse. It's a town tradition. And why is it a horse? Because it's Elmhurst's mascot. Why is that? Because it is. So, basically because there's no actual reason, theoretically, Elmhurst's mascot can be any animal? - No. - Well, yes, yes. - No, it couldn't. - But it could. Not really. You see where I'm going with this? No, I don't. It's a horse. It's a Christmas horse. Okay. Couldn't be any other animal. It's a Christmas horse. So, may I interest you in purchasing one of these Christmas horses for what I can only assume is your beloved ornament collection with which you so wholeheartedly celebrate the holidays? No thank you, Mrs. Claus. I'm good. I'm a fun elf! Not so fun to me. Ready to go, sweetie? Do I look like Mrs. Claus to you? Joyce: Look, Mr. Mittens! It's the most successful Project Christmas Wish yet. It may be. First let's see how many of these wishes we can make come true. All right. I'll sort, you make a list, we'll divide and conquer? Yes. (chuckling) Okay. "Dear Project Christmas Wish, Christmas means home "and it's not quite home without family. "So, what would truly make this Christmas for me "is for my son to come home from base." - Who's it from? - Cheryl Wallace. Her son Parker is stationed at a base in San Diego. I know last year flights were too expensive to bring him home. Then why didn't she wish last year? I don't know. Every year she runs the wreath-making event to benefit Project Christmas Wish but never actually wishes. Then let's make this a priority. (music playing on radio) ♪ Hap-hap-hap-happy new year Here you go. ♪ Hap-hap-hap-happy new year ♪ Hap-hap-hap-happy new year to me ♪ Mike on radio: Just a couple more carols to get your morning started right... Thank you, sweetheart. ...and then I'll have Lucy on my show with a Project Christmas Wish update. Grandpa? Can you please take me to the radio station? Why, honey? 'Cause the Project Christmas Wish people are there, and I have a wish I wanna make. Please? I'd be super happy. And it's all I want for Christmas. Okay, Max-Max. - Really? - Really? Why don't you go grab your jacket and meet me by the door? I remember don't think Lucas will agree to this. Well then, maybe we don't ask him. I know, I know. But look how happy Max is. Isn't that what really matters? It's time for Lucas to get on board. It's Christmas. And how can he say no to Max's wish? (mouthing words) Come on! I think he'll assume this is for the best and he'll come around. Yep. - Like this one? - Remix! - This is a good one! - (Mike humming) (jazzy Christmas song playing) Grandpa: Excuse me. Hi. Mike: Looks like we got some guests! Grandpa, that's her. The elf from the store! I remember you. Did you make your Project Christmas Wish? Not yet. But...I'm here now! Why don't you just tell Lucy your wish on air? Really? Can I? It's okay with me if it's okay with your grandpa. You're gonna be on the radio! Lucy: All right, you ready? Come on. Grab that chair. Mike on radio: This is Morning Mike coming to you with a special surprise guest here to make an in-person Project Christmas Wish. Welcome, Max. Max: Hi. Tell us about your wish. - Um... - You're doing great. Well, my family used to have the best Christmases. We'd decorate the tree and bake gingerbread and go ice skating. It was perfect. And my dad was always happy. But then, three years ago, my mom died. And now we don't do any of that, and my dad seems kinda sad. So, my Project Christmas Wish is for a Christmas like we used to have, with my mom. So my dad will be happy again. Your wish is my command. Mike: Sounds like we have our Project Christmas Wish of the season! Boom! More coming up right after this. Make sure you guys stay tuned. This is bad. Lucy: That was fun! I'm so glad you came. Wait a second, what are you doing here? I'm Project Christmas Wish. What are you doing here? I'm Max's dad, the parent that should've been asked permission before granting Max's wish. I'm sorry, I assumed she had your permission. To broadcast our personal lives all over the radio? No, she did not. Would you excuse us just a moment? Lucas. This could be a good thing. Oh, yeah, to be the focal point of town gossip could be a great thing. Hey, don't flatter yourself, buddy. Regardless of what Max said on air, this isn't about you. It's about Max. Let's go home and talk, okay? I am so sorry about all this. I did not see it going this way. It's okay, I understand. That was... a surprising wish. Plus, he lost someone. That's really hard. It is. Especially this time of year. But I do think he'll come around. Lucas: Muffin, why didn't you tell me any of this? Because I know it makes you sad, and I wanted you to be happy. And I just... I want Christmas like it used to be. I know. I know. Me too. And he comes storming up screaming. Well, maybe not screaming, per se, but his tone was quite severe. So, are you gonna pick a new Big wish of the season? Of course not. I'm doubling down. (chuckling) That's much more in character. I already made a whole plan. Operation Christ-Max Wish. Goal- make a Christmas magic again. How'd you do this already? What's that look? I know what this means to you, and I know why it means it to you. But, Max isn't you. Of course. I know that. I know you've had Max's best interests at heart, but you should've asked me first. We know. We messed up. "We"? But really, we're so sorry. So, what are you gonna do? What can I do? I'm between a holiday and a hard place. I mean, Max is beyond excited and I would be the biggest Grinch of all time if I took that away from her. Plus the town is already buzzing about "Christmas Dad". Christmas Dad? Oh, yeah. That's what Elmhurst has nicknamed the new focal point of their gossip. - Well, it's catchy. - (giggling) How can I say no? But also, doesn't it seem kinda weird to have a stranger celebrate Christmas with my daughter? And especially that stranger? Hon, Lucy isn't a stranger. Yeah, in the five years we've lived here, we've gotten to know her well. She's a town gem! And maybe exactly what you two need right now. How do you figure? Because I know Max's wish was for a Christmas like she used to have, but maybe, instead of trying to relive what used to be, Lucy could help you create something new. (sighing) Maybe. Maybe. Thank you. Back for the horse ornament? I'm back to say I am sorry for how I reacted. And you're super excited to make Max's Christmas wish come true? No. No, it's, uh, you know, it's complicated. I understand. But it's Christmas, and Christmas should be a relief from the complicated, especially for a kid. I know you and Max lost someone, and remembering is hard. Believe me, forgetting is harder. Okay. Fine. You can do one Christmas activity with Max. That should scratch the itch. How's that gonna scratch the itch? Plus, she's the Christmas wish of the season. But you're the boss. So, I assume you don't have a Christmas tree yet? Nope. Okay. Well then, meet me at the lot on Lowell Street tomorrow afternoon. By the way, did you start this Christmas Dad thing? What Christmas Dad thing? Cullen: Is Joan here? Good morning, Cullen. No, she's not here yet. She's still on-site but she should be... Actually, I'm here to see you. I wanna make a Christmas wish. (gasping) Mm! Do tell! I wanna propose to Joan. Yes! Oh, how exciting! How can I help? Well, believe it or not, I'm not the most romantic. So, I was hoping you had some ideas? I have a million ideas! Oh! Hi. What's going on? - I... Well... I was just telling Cullen that Christmas Dad came around and he's allowing me one Christmas activity. So, Cullen has graciously offered to gift Max a tree she picks out from his lot. Well, Cullen is very sweet and generous. And one holiday activity is progress. Well, I see it more as a jumping off point for negotiations. You think he'll budge? We'll see. All I know is I have a can-do holiday spirit and too much caffeine and sugar running through my veins, so what is that spell? Christmas magic! - Catastrophe! The answer was... it was Christmas magic. Christmas magic. - I don't know about that. - Okay. I'll see you later. See ya, honey. (mouthing words) (giggling) - Hi, Max! - This is awesome. Can I run ahead and look? Uh, yeah. Just make sure I can see you, okay? Pick us out a good tree! I'm trusting you. (sighing) So, you recently moved here? Yeah, about six months ago from Boston. I grew up there. Max was born there. My parents just retired here and I wanted to be close. Plus, I can work remotely. - Oh, what do you do? - Software engineer. - That explains it. Explains what? The sense I got of a logic-based brain. Because of the Christmas horse? Never mind. So, any hobbies or interests? (sighing) Mainly just trying to juggle. Stop it! You juggle? I mean juggle life. Being a dad, work, personal time. Oh. That's a lot less fun than actual juggling, but definitely more meaningful. What about you? Are you from here? Yep. I grew up here, left for college, moved to Austin, and worked for a children's non-profit, then came back home. Oh, is that when you started Project Christmas Wish? Yeah. I'm not just the founder. I am also a member. My mom helps, but it's a full-time job. Granting wishes and preparing for the Christmas Carnival Fundraiser. It's a big, two-day event we host that funds Project Christmas Wish. It's the two days before Christmas Eve. You'll have to bring Max. As the wish of the season, she'll be the Queen of the Carnival. Yeah. We'll see. (sniffing) Cullen: Hey, Luce! - Hey! - Hey! Oh! You must be Christmas Dad! You know what? You are in great hands with Lucy. She's actually helping make my Christmas wish come true too. And your tree's on me. Oh, that's... you know what, that's not necessary. Come on. Of course it is... Christmas Dad. Well, when you... when you put it like that. Thank you. I found our tree! Can we take it home and decorate it with Lucy? Please? This is from where we used to live. (gasping) That's pretty! Do you miss Boston? I miss my friends. Have you made any friends here? Everyone in my class already has friends. Ready? All right. Here you go. That's for you. Hold on tight. (grunting) You are getting heavy! Next year you are gonna be lifting me. - (giggling) - There you go. Shall we plug it in? All right, here we go. (gasping) Oh! So pretty! I love it! So, what are we gonna do next? Bake gingerbread? Go ice skating? Ah. Guess it didn't scratch that itch. This is gonna end, is it? Little over two weeks until Christmas Eve and then I promise it ends. (Lucas sighing) But until then... Project Christ-Max Wish. A detailed, no-fail plan for the perfect Christmas for you both. A Christmas where what used to be meets what could be. Okay. Fine. That's the spirit... Christmas Dad. So, what do you know about wreath making? Nothing. But I'm a quick study. Shouldn't we be focusing on wishes instead of the fundraiser? We still have two weeks until the carnival. I know. But I told Max she was carnival guest of honor. I just wanna make sure it's extra special. But you're right, we should be focusing on wishes. Any updates? Well, we have all these broad wishes this season. Folks wanting friends to spend the holidays with, and wishes for love. And I'm not sure how to grant those. Well, you could start dating again. Oh, are we talking about people dating again? And what's happening with bringing Cheryl's son Parker home from base? - (chuckling) It's happening. I put the word out and people started donating airline points. And then Josie from the travel agency pulled some strings for discounted airfare. Oh, love it. Well, I wrangled a dozen tablets for the elementary school. That was principal Wilson's wish. And Jessica Aleman wished for a car. Taking the bus to work was adding hours to her commute so Teaghan Franks is gifting an old car she doesn't use any more. Yay, us! And um, how's our big wish of the season? Well, it's just ramping up, but Max is really enjoying it. And she's just adorable. The sweetest. Her father, on the other hand... I've met prickly people before, but he's a walking cactus. - It's just a Christmas tree. - Maybe. Or maybe it's you two bouncing back. Angela: Celebrating Christmas, building a home, finding love again? It's okay to be happy again, Lucas. Maybe it's time to start to date. Daddy, are you gonna date? What? No. (scoffing) No, Grandpa didn't say date, he said... - Mate! - That's not better. - I meant hate. - Making it worse. I meant enervate. Situate. Hibernate. That's all I got. Max, please go get your shoes. We're gonna go to Lucy's soon, okay? Really? Mate? That was truly a legendary accomplishment in making a bad situation worse. Enh. We all have our strengths. - (Angela chuckling) - You are ridiculous. - Lucas: Excited? - Max: I'm very excited. (doorbell ringing) Welcome. Come on in! You really like Christmas! That just become clear now? (cat meowing) You have a cat? Meet Mr. Mittens. Your cat's name is Mr. Mittens? No, it's Spike. He is vicious, so I'd keep my distance. Mm-hm. Are you ready to bake cookies? So, tomorrow is the wreath decorating event I told you about, and I invited my friends and their daughter Sonia who I think you'll really like. And I thought we could bring cookies to break the ice. There's no better way to make a friend than with a cookie. ♪ Jingle bells, jiggle bells ♪ Jingle all the way Mr. Mittens and I have a lot of time on our hands. I thought this should fit you. It's perfect. I didn't know if you had any food allergies so I found a gluten-free, soy-free, egg-free, dairy-free, nut-free, of course, Christmas cookie recipe! Ah. Just like grandma used to bake. Lucy: Max, you wanna start on the dry ingredients? All right, let's make these cookies very sweet. Are there five? There should be five. Max: There's four. Lucy: What we'll do is we'll put a little bit like that. (inhaling) Muffin... What is it? Mommy and me used to do this together. (sighing) You know, Max, my dad passed away when I was about your age. Really? How'd you stop feeling sad? That's a really good question. Can I think about it a little and get back to you? Okay. (sighing) She's eight years old, they've only been here for about a month, and, oh... I think I see them. Hi, Max! Hi! I think you're going to love Sonia. Come on. Lucas, these are Sonia's parents, Melanie and Nolan. Max, this is Sonia. - Hi. Hi! Did you know that you both love unicorns and rainbows? Talk amongst yourselves. Sonia, do you wanna make a wreath? Sure! Do you want a cookie? Uh-oh. Poor Sonia's about to eat one of our cookies. Did you try 'em? - I did. What did you think? I think they tasted like a delicious Christmas cookie, if you removed all the ingredients making it delicious and replaced them with cardboard and oat milk? You're really selling it. Little secret- before I came, I filled up on egg nog at the cart near Be Home Design. - Hmm. - You have to try it. It's a town seasonal treasure. Seems like everything in Elmhurst is a seasonal treasure. Does that mean you might be coming around to the whole holiday spirit? Unlikely. I think I'm already pushing my limits being Christmas Dad. (laughing) But be honest with me. Are you the source of my nickname? - I might've mentioned it... - Oh, my... And it happened to take off, but come on! It's cool. It makes you sound like a superhero. (chuckling) You can do heroic holiday things while wearing underwear outside your pants. Well... any excuse for that, right? You just made a joke! - Okay. - (laughing) Ooh, I hear the angels singing! I'll have you know that I can be quite charming and delightfully hilarious. I will take your word for it. Max: Daddy! Come see my wreath! Time to wreath. Oh! Uh, Morning Mike is wondering if Max can come on air tomorrow. We usually track the big wish of the season on his show to keep the town involved. If Max wants to do it, then it's okay with me. Wow. Sweetie. Sweetie, it's time. Cheryl, we were hoping you might be able to record a short spot about the wreath making event. Why you started it, what it means to you? - Of course I can! - Great. - Just right over here. - Be right back. Just keep goin'. This is Cheryl Wallace. Tell us what's going on here today. Well, um, making homemade wreaths used to be something I did with my son Parker and now I host the event not because all the proceeds go to a great cause, Project Christmas Wish, but also because wherever Parker is in the world, it makes me feel like I'm close to him. Tell us what you wished for this year. Well, it's always... (crowd gasping) Oh my... Oh, Parker, I can't believe it! (laughing and crying) (crowd reactions) You made my Christmas. Thank you... Oh, thank you. (applause) Mike on air: Max, fill us in. How is your Project Christmas Wish going? Max: Amazing. We decorated the whole house and made cookies, and decorated wreaths, and maybe I made some new friends. But I wanna change my wish. You do? Why? Well, I thought having a Christmas like we used to have with my mom would make my dad happy. But now I realize what will actually make him happy, and so I have a new wish. I want my dad to be in love again. Uh-oh. Mike: You heard it here first, listeners. Christmas Dad's available and on the market. Keep it locked right here. Christmas carols comin' up after this. Hi. (awkward chuckling) Nothin' to see here. Just keep it movin'. ♪ Hey! Where you comin' back from? Oh, just making dreams come true left and right, no big deal. So, what's next on the wish list? Peace on Earth? Two front teeth? Mistletoe kisses? Mmm! Speaking of, what did you decide about Max's wish for her dad? Ooh, that's a tough one. I understand Max wanting her dad to have love, but Lucas lost someone and I don't want to be intrusive. You don't? Since when? Ha-ha. But then Max had a great idea. She and Sonia became friends at Carol's wreath making event. So she thought, what if we do something like that but for adults? And we had a bunch of Project Christmas Wishes for love and I thought, what if we host a mixer? That takes the focus off of Lucas. Right! Because wishes plus fundraiser plus working here means you have too much free time and need something else to take on? Save me, I can't help myself! (giggling) Uh... I have a sudden craving for egg nog. Grab me one? Oh, of course! Hi. Why are we re-enacting Spy Vs Spy? Look, it always seems like I'm with Joan or you are, and I wanna get working on the proposal. So, I was hoping to do it over the holidays while Joan's parents are back in town. Perfect! Because I have an idea. Okay, imagine this. Most romantic proposal ever. I like the sound of that. You propose at the Christmas Carnival Fundraiser when I invite Joan to the stage to thank her as a sponsor. So, I propose in front of the whole town. You propose in front of her whole community, everyone who loves her. Plus, the decorated stage will make a super cute backdrop for proposal pics. Okay... Okay, so we'll decorate the stage and have carols playing and snow falling and the whole town there to witness you getting down on one knee, professing eternal love. What do you think? Doesn't that sound... Completely over-the-top. Cullen, you're the first to admit you're not the most romantic, so maybe take my lead on this? You do know I have a crippling fear of public speaking. Great, so I'll start working on specifics, we can reconvene to discuss, but I have to get going. I promised Joan an egg nog. Santa: Ho, ho, ho! I recognize that mane. - Hello. - Hello. How are you doing? Oh, you mean since my eight-year-old daughter once more broadcast my personal life to the entire town? The upside is instead of being Christmas Dad, I am now Eligible in Elmhurst. Did you start that one too? I have a knack for catchy nicknames. Hey, you're good at it. Is Max around? No, Sonia's mom took the girls ice skating. Sonia and Max did become fast friends! Unicorns and rainbows for the win. Oh, I'm glad I bumped into you because, inspired by Max's new wish, we are hosting a singles' mixer. Max told me about it. I'm, uh, not so sure. Hi, I'll do a small egg nog, please, and whatever the lady will have. Oh, you don't need to get my drink. I'm also ordering for Joan. It is the least I can do. I mean, for all the attention you've gotten me. Okay. I will have one small egg nog for Joan, and I would like to get one large egg nog with extra whipped cream, extra chocolate syrup, and crushed peppermint on top, please. What? You're, uh...like a child. I will take that as the compliment you did not intend it to be. Actually, it was a compliment. Ho, ho, ho! - For you. - Thank you. Ho, ho, ho! So, explain something to me. You work at Be Home Design. - Yes. My best friend Joan is an interior designer, and most of the year I assist her and run the showroom. But, come December, I focus on the store's holiday display and Project Christmas Wish, which is my real love. I've been doing it for a decade and building it ever since. How did it start? It's kind of a long story. Well, I have all the time in the world if you do. Okay. Do you wanna sit? Love to. I mentioned my dad passed away when I was young. Yeah, that's really tough. It happened right before the holidays. And, my mom was looking for work but we were really stretching a dollar. Hmm. There was too much month at the end of the money, you know. Anyway, I... I knew that Santa would come for me, but I wasn't so sure that we'd have enough money for my mom or the rest of it, like the tree or the stocking stuffers, or a real Christmas Eve dinner. It was a really hard time. Then the day before Christmas Eve, the doorbell rang and I opened it to find... a tree. And all these gifts. And stocking stuffers, and bags of groceries. And a card from Santa's Little Helpers. The town did it? I still don't know who or how, but Elmhurst came together to make my Christmas wish come true. That's amazing. So, that is why I started Project Christmas Wish, to return the favor. But to clarify, I didn't start Project Christmas Wish because I felt like I needed to repay a debt. It's more just that I believe in the power of a wish, and I believe you're never given a wish without being given the ability to make it come true. I know that about you. I should, uh, get back to the store. Yes. Thank you very much for the egg nog. My pleasure. You know, Lucy... what about you? What about me? What's your wish? You look surprised. 'Cause no one's asked me that in a really long time. Well, I hope you ask yourself, because if anyone's wish deserves to come true, it's yours. Mike: Good afternoon, Elmhurst. Back on my show today is everyone's favorite Christmas elf, Lucy Keller! Here with a Project Christmas Wish update. We've got a lot of wishes from Elmhurst residents looking for friends to spend the holidays with. So, if you're in the market for a new BFF, then post on our website. Or give us a call! We'll be taking callers. Speaking of which, coming up right after the break, we're gonna have a caller that's wondering why Lucy has yet to make their Project Christmas Wish come true yet. Thanks for that, Mike. And also stay tuned to hear how Mike has so generously offered to buy a dozen more children the Christmas gift of their dreams. Can we convince Mike to make it two dozen? I need your help, callers. Ring-a-ling-a-ling. Cut. What?! Merry Christmas, Mike. Merry Christmas, Lucy. You're killin' me over here! ♪ What is all this? Hanukkah! Sonia celebrates Hanukkah and invited me to join. So, Grandma and Grandpa offered to do it here while we set up for the mixer. - Fun! What are you guys doing here? Well, we came for lunch and then we stayed for Max guilting us into helping decorate. Not that I'm complaining. There are fresh homemade latkes. Mm-hm. Speaking of which, could you grab me a latke? Sure, hon. I wanna catch up on the proposal. What, about eight days? Well, we're going to do the proposal on the second night so technically nine, and don't worry, I've got it all under control. Are you sure? Because I was thinking we could do something simpler? (whispering) No! I've already got it handled. I've hired the violinist. What violinist? - For the carols playing in the background. You want romantic, right? This is romantic as it gets! Lucy... What's goin' on? Hey, Lucas! Have you met Joan yet? Um, I have in passing, but it's nice to properly meet you. You too. She's heard so much about you. Really? On... the radio. - Go eat your latke. - Okay. Daddy, Lucy! Look. It's a friendship bracelet. Sonia made it for me for Hanukkah. That is so cool. I want one just like that. Maybe you should wish for it. - Ooh! - Hmm. (chuckling) Come on, Max! She is so happy. Thank you. I'm sorry, what was that? Can you repeat that? - (chuckling) So mature! Thank you, Project Christmas Wish. Was that so hard? Yeah! It felt a little taxing. Ugh. Should we tackle these lights? Yeah. I think Max might've gone a little overboard. Where do you think she learned that one from? Just sayin'. So, did you give any more thought to your wish? Oh, I did, actually. And I realized I have everything I want. A loving community, Project Christmas Wish, a stable job that pays the bills. Why would I ask for more? I think if someone else asked you that, you would respond by saying that they deserve to ask for everything. You oddly know me very well. Well, we've been spending a lot of time together. So, do you know whether you'll be going to the mixer? Hmm. Well, you throwing it at the diner was an ingenious way to force my hand... (giggling) ...but I'm still not sure. What about you? Are you going? I'm hosting it. Well, what I mean is are you not just the founder but also a member? Ooh. If you're asking if I'm single, then yes, I am. I'm actually divorced. It's been a few years. I met him in Austin and we moved back here. Do you mind if I ask what happened? He had this best female friend, a childhood friend. And I used to always joke that they'd be perfect together. But they assured me that they were just best friends. And then somewhere along the way, they became more, and now they're married. That's rough. It was rough. It was a loss. A loss of love, a loss of dreams, a loss of a whole... life I thought I was going to live. I get loss. What was your wife like? She was, uh, so many things. Reserved and shy, but she was also so hilarious. Once you got to know her, brilliant and kind. When we met it was like lightning struck. I know the feeling. Do you think it'll ever strike again? I don't know. I don't know. What do you think? I asked you first. Um, you know, I was told that lightning doesn't strike the same spot twice. Right? What about you? Well, I'm not looking to fly a kite attached to a key any time soon. - Good. (chuckling) So that wouldn't be your wish? Oh, you're pushing this wish thing kinda hard. Okay, I guess if I had to make a wish, I'd say that... I'm so grateful for my job at the store, but also, it's Joan's passion. Not mine. I have tons of non-profit experience and Project Christmas Wish is what I live for. I would love to make it a year-round thing. A real non-profit. I feel like it's the one thing I have to give. No. No way. What you have to give is you, and that's very special. Project Christmas Wish is just how you give it. So, if that's what you wanna do, why don't you just do it? Oh, I barely cover wish expenses as it is. You know, someone very persuasive once told me that no one is given a wish without being given the power to make it come true. Hm. That's a very smart person. I think so. (sighing) Just not enough funding. (door opening) Joyce: Hello! I'm in here. Just popping by on my way home. Wanted to see what you were doing for dinner. Oh. I'm heading out on a little wish business. I'm going over to Lucas's to make a gingerbread house with Max like the ones Dad used to make for me. Wow! I haven't heard you talk about that in a long time. I thought maybe you forgot. Think maybe I was trying to forget. Like I believed somehow that would make missing him easier. A little bit ago, Max asked me how I stopped feeling sad. I didn't know how to answer. I didn't think I had tried to stop feeling sad. But then I realized how often I push memories of Dad away, or...how especially this time of year I keep every minute jam-packed with wishes or carnival or a million other things, like if I stay busy enough, somehow the sadness won't creep in. But it doesn't work like that. And I don't wanna do it anymore. I'm so proud of you. (doorbell ringing) Both: Come in! I set up everything we need for our gingerbread house. Oh, thank you! But we're actually going to make a different kind of gingerbread house. Do you still have those moving boxes? - Moving boxes? - Trust me. ♪ I feel it in my fingers ♪ I feel it in my toes ♪ Christmas is all around me ♪ And so the feeling grows I think this is some of my finest work. ♪ It's written in the wind ♪ It's everywhere I go ♪ So if you really love Christmas ♪ ♪ Come on and let it snow It's awesome! Let's go in! (phone vibrating) Grandpa's calling. I'll be right back. Thought you'd never ask. ♪ Christmas is all around me - After you. - Merci. (giggling) ♪ And so the feeling grows Oh, wow! This is pretty cozy. We should hang stockings and build a Christmas tree and put some gifts underneath it. Yeah? Oh, I just remembered. Merry Christmas, Lucy. You didn't have to do that! But I'm glad you did. (giggling) Now we have matching ones! Thank you! I love it! And thank you very much for building this gingerbread house with me. I used to do this with my dad. Hey, Max. Remember when you asked me how I stopped feeling sad? Yeah. Well, I gave it a lot of thought, and I think everyone would answer that question differently but for me, the answer is that you don't wanna try to stop feeling sad. Sadness is part of life. And we need the sadness because it makes the joy that much more joyful. But we just have to keep our hearts open. Okay? Okay. Thanks, Lucy. Oh. I almost forgot. I have something for you two, but it's mainly for your dad. (chuckling) The infamous Elmhurst Christmas horse! (chuckling) I mean, I still don't understand this because of my logic-based brain, but I definitely appreciate it. I'll see you tomorrow to help finish setting up for the mixer. Oh, you don't have to do that. But I want to. It's part of my wish. Okay, see ya later. What? Don't you wanna make my Christmas wish come true? (sighing) Hey, Lucy! I'll see you at the mixer. See you tomorrow. (Inhaling) You happy now? I know you have your hands full, so I went ahead with the community matching wish. I've already set up ten people with Christmas Eve dinners. Ooh! By the way, six days until Christmas Eve, so we've gotta set the menu! Adding it to my scroll of a to-do list. We finished arranging all the snacks. Anything else we can do? No, thank you so much. You've done more than enough. You could say a little prayer that people actually show up tonight? You know Daddy will be here. Aha. (chuckling) Okay, Max-Max. Let's head home. Have fun tonight! Thank you, Max. (Angela giggling) Okay, I think we're just about done here. We should go get dressed. Speaking of dress, I made you an early Christmas present. (quietly) Uh-oh. I was going for strong, independent elf getting back out there. You nailed it. Thank you, Mom. I love it. Okay. Should we go get dolled up and I'll meet you back here? Mom. You want me to have love again, right? I want that for you too. I know. It's just... is this really how I'm gonna meet someone? Over cheese dip and awkward conversation. Maybe. Maybe not. But let's at least stay open to it. Okay? Okay, hold still. What am I, in the seventh grade? Are you my chaperone, Mom? I'm just making sure everything goes off without a hitch. I'm also making sure that maybe you're okay. I think I'm okay! - Yeah? - Yeah. I mean, I'm nervous and I feel a bit rusty and... I don't know if I'm ready, but... - (laughing) Here we go. Right? You look very handsome. Thanks, Mom. - You did your tie really good. - Thanks. (soft music playing) (clearing throat) (whispering) Yeah? Go on. You know, I was hoping you were gonna bring out your fun elf costume again. (giggling) But this is so much better. You look gorgeous. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Well done on the event. Thank you. - Shall we? - Sure. (sighing) We're not really doing much mixing. I'm okay with that. So am I. Oh, I was meaning to tell you, I ran the numbers on making Project Christmas Wish a year-round thing. Although, I guess technically Christmas is just December so the rest of the year I would just be a stranger meddling in people's affairs. Dream job! (chuckling) That's your dream job! Come on. Well, kinda, yeah. Unfortunately, it's just not possible. What happened to where there's a wish, there's a way? Doesn't apply this time. ♪ Bells will be ringing I never asked! ♪ The glad, glad news How about you?

Lucy: Good news. Mary Kay is out of the hospital and thanks everyone for their visits and meals... I will never tire of hearing your voice on the radio. Ugh. Hearing my own voice is like nails on a chalkboard. I can't wait until Christmas is over. (gasping) Gasp. I didn't mean that. Don't ever tell anyone I said that. Okay. But back on the topic... (clearing throat) Your dance with Lucas? It was just a dance. Maybe a friendly dance? Maybe he was just thanking me for helping him with Max. A fruit basket is a thank you. A dance is romance. And stop denying it. You and Lucas have stars beaming out of your eyes every time you look at each other. You're like cartoon characters. Oh. That explains why my stomach feels like an accordion. You mean butterflies? Enjoy it. What's wrong? It's Cullen. He's withdrawn and secretive and he's always running off. I'm just... wondering... is he avoiding me? Does he... wanna break up? What? No, of course not! Then what's going on with him? I'm sure whatever it is, you'll find out soon enough. But I have to get going. I have to go set up for the fundraiser. (inhaling) All my friends are weird. Cullen, whatever you're doing, stop. Please, try to act normal if that's at all in your wheelhouse. Oh. This is Lucy, by the way. Bye! (sighing) (doorbell ringing) - Hey! - Hello! (chuckling) Hi, honey. Hi, Mom. Good morning. We brought fresh-made doughnuts. Agh, sorry. We should've asked first. Hey, it's fine. It is fine. It is the holidays, right? Why don't you take those to the kitchen and put 'em on a plate, sweetheart? (satisfied sighing) (chuckling) Whoa! Wow! That's so... Uh, over-the-top? Yeah, that is her middle name. Max and I made it with Lucy. Ah. Seems like you two have been spending a lot of time with Lucy. Yeah. Yeah, well there's Max's wish. Plus we're becoming friends. Hmm. And, yeah. I think there's something there. And Max absolutely loves her. (whispering) You know, but then it kinda feels like we're forgetting about Stephanie. And I thought the whole point of Max's wish was to remember her, not replace her. Lucas, honey. Stephanie was her mother. No one can replace her. Max: Come eat! - (Lucas chuckling) - Max: Lucy! (laughing) Hello! Ooh, look what I have here. Both: Bling! (giggling) - What is this? - It's for the carnival games. Daddy and I made it. It's pin the tail... on the Christmas horse! Aw, that's great! She did all of it. Thank you. - Also Lucy, you know how you said I'll be the queen of the carnival? Mm-hm? Does that mean I can make a speech? Oh! Oh, are you asking my permission this time? Very thoughtful. (chuckling) You know, if it's okay with Lucy, it's okay with me. (mouthing word) Yes! You wanna bring that over here? Sure. By the way, did you find out why Elmhurst's mascot is a horse? Not yet, but it's the next thing on my to do list after sleep. Yes. Can I put you to work? Actually, I'm busy. As the newest member of Project Christmas Wish, I, uh, got something that I'm working on. Ooh! That's excited. What is it? Just official wish business. If it's official, you should probably run it by me. Let me rephrase. Secret wish business. You'll find out. Be patient. Oh. See... I'm not really known for my patience. (chuckling) I know. Come over for pizza tonight? Sure. - (giggling) - Whoa! So, did I say that I couldn't juggle? 'Cause, I don't know, I kinda... do a little juggling. You stinker! Now we need hot chocolate to dip our snow people in. It's a good try but it's bedtime. Bedtime is not part of my Project Christmas Wish. Well done, kiddo! It's a good try, but no. So, say good night to Lucy. Good night. (giggling) Hey. You don't have to go. I'll just be like, ten or 15 minutes. Okay. I'll stay. Oh, she went out like a light! Lucy? ♪ I see you found the fire pit. - I found it. Just in case you're cold. It feels really nice to just sit. Oh, I forgot to tell you, I did some Elmhurst horse mascot research. Ooh, please tell me it's an incredibly romantic story? So, it turns out, Elmhurst's founding father, he rode his horse across the entire country and he was looking for the love of his life that he had seen in a dream. - Ah! - But meanwhile, Elmhurst's founding mother was riding her own horse across the country, looking for the love of her life, that only she had seen in a dream. Oh! And fate would have it that their paths crossed right here in Elmhurst, whereupon laying eyes on each other for the first time, they ran in slow motion through a field of wildflowers into each other's arms. (laughing) Way to toy with my emotions! I'm sorry. The truth isn't that excited. There just used to be a lot of wild horses here. - Oh. - Yeah. That's substantially less romantic. I know. So, the horse mystery is solved, but... I couldn't find an explanation for the Elmhurst Christmas horse. I made it up. I just combined my two favorite things- Elmhurst and Christmas and added a catchy nickname. And it stuck! You and your nicknames! (laughing) You are so beautiful. Can I kiss you? ♪ (whispering) I'm sorry. I... uh... I should go. Well, you live here. I'll go. (sighing) (movie m) Mm. Pretty romantic stuff, Mr. Mittens. At least we have each other. (meowing) Thanks for that. (door opening) Joyce: Hello! You're not dressed yet? The fundraiser starts in an hour! Let me help you with that. Lucy! Sorry. No! I made this for the carnival volunteers. - But I need it. - Honey! What are you doin'? Trying to eat an entire yule log for breakfast. How does it seem like I'm doing? Just call Lucas! No! I'm not calling him. He's the one that freaked out, not me. You know, this is a lot for him. And I know you can empathize. I definitely empathize. But also, I don't wanna fall for someone who's in love with someone else. I've already done that. It's easy to move old wounds onto new people, but try not to shut down, okay? (crowd chatter, music) Hey, Cullen. Hi, Lucy. Question. Why was a snow machine delivered to the tree lot today? Oh good, it arrived. Well, just in case it doesn't snow during the proposal tomorrow. We have to have snow. I don't know. It just doesn't feel right. You said you wanted romantic. I meant romantic for me and Joan, not for a steamy romance novel. Hi, you two! - I'm gonna go see Santa. - Okay. Do you see what I mean? I think he wants to break up. No. I don't... I'm gonna go find my parents, okay? Oh, boy. Lucy! The queen of the carnival has arrived. We're going to take our photo with Santa! Come be in it! No, honey, that's a family photo. Why don't you take Grandma and Grandpa and go wait in line up there, okay? I'll be there in a minute. Hi. Hi. Listen, I'm sorry for how I reacted, and for not reaching out to you. (inhaling) It's, uh, it's complicated. I know, but I think this is supposed to be a relief from the complicated. Yeah, I wish it could be. I really do. Because I have a lot of feelings for you. I just don't know if I'm ready, or if I'll ever be ready. Oh. Okay. I can't just... wait around for you to figure that out, Lucas. You... I know you're afraid. So am I. But... I'm a human being. I have emotions, and I can't just give you my heart and hope that one day maybe you'll do the same. I have to protect myself. (sighing) It has been so wonderful, spending this time with you and Max. You made my Christmas. But? I think we just let ourselves get swept away. You're not ready and I don't wanna get hurt again. We should just be friends, okay? Max: Daddy! They're waiting for you. Okay. (exhaling) Mom, and Martha, what are you doing here? You've adopted me for Christmas! I was one of those wishes for friends to spend Christmas with. And I promise to repay your kindness in homemade shortbread. Ooh! Martha's gonna join us for Christmas Eve dinner. Oh! Your shortbread and your company. Merry Christmas to us. Love. What's wrong? I, uh, should go do my rounds. But the holiday punch is delicious. You two should go grab a glass. Does it have rum in it? - It better! - (chuckling) You've been awfully quiet. Something going on? Well, I think I ended things with Lucy. What? Why'd you do that? Well, based upon your reaction, because I'm an idiot. Obviously. Son. I guess... it's like sometimes when I'm with Lucy, I feel like everything is perfectly right. Like lightning struck again. And then I just start to feel guilty. Like I'm betraying Stephanie. I'm just afraid that I'm gonna forget her. You could never forget her. Lucas, where there's deep grief, there was great love. It may feel like grief is the last way that we can love someone we've lost, but it's not. Love doesn't end. It just changes form. And Stephanie and Lucy are two entirely different loves. Lucas: Hey, Muffin, it's time for bed! (clearing throat) Knock-knock. Max: Come in. Okay. Oh. Max, what's going on? I know you and Lucy got into a fight. Where did you hear that? Grandma and Grandpa were talking about it. Lucy and I, we did not get into a fight, honey. We just... we might not see her around as much in the future. But I love Lucy, and I'll miss her! I know. I'll miss her too. But we don't have to be sad about it, okay? 'Cause we're gonna see her around town all the time. Plus, we made her Christmas wish come true. What wish? You know, the big surprise. Daddy, that wasn't her real wish. (chatter, cheering) ♪ (grunting) Wow. What are you doing? Uh... I'm sorry, is that a snow machine? Uh, no. I mean... Yes? I mean... Cullen, what is going on with you? Are you breaking up with me? What? No, of course not! Okay. Then why are you being so weird? I'm being weird because I love you. That doesn't really explain it. And I wanna marry you. That's why I've been off. Because I asked Lucy to help me plan out this big, romantic proposal and it totally got out of hand. As everything with Lucy does. I learned that. So, what I'm trying to say is... you're my soul mate. And you know we're lifers, so, you wanna make it official? Yes! Yes, of course! (chuckling) I love you. - I love you. Lucas: Oh. Shoot. Hey. Sorry, was I interrupting something? Yeah, a little. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. If you're looking for Lucy, she's in there. But it might be best to give her some space? Yes, I understand she needs some space. But also, I could really use your help. Really important. Honey, talk to me. I'm fine. Really. I mean, focus on the positive, right? It's our best Project Christmas Wish ever, most successful fundraiser. What more could I ask for? Except that's the problem. Now I wanna ask for everything. You know, after the divorce, I just wanted to forget. About the heartbreak, the loss. But most of all, I wanted to forget about the love. And I did forget. I forgot how good it can be. And Lucas reminded me of that. He reminded me that I do want love in my life, and that I should ask for it. I should ask for everything. So... yes, things with Lucas didn't work out how I had hoped... ..but some good came from it. I love you so much. I love you too, Mom. (sighing) I should get to the stage to make sure Cullen has everything set up for the proposal. I'll pack up and meet you there. Okay. All good? Have you linked up with the violinist? Okay. Hey, perfect timing! Are you ready for your big speech? Kind of. (nervous chuckling) You're gonna be great. Where's your dad? Um, he'll be here later. Okay. Let's go. Hello, everyone. This is Max, our big Project Christmas Wish recipient of the year, and she has a few words to share. (applause) Um, hi. I'm Max. And I just wanna say thank you to everyone for helping make my Project Christmas Wish come true. But actually, my wish didn't really come true because I've learned that sometimes we wish for one thing but really want something else. Like how I wished for a Christmas like it used to, but what I really wanted was to not feel sad anymore. But now I'm glad that my wish didn't come true, 'cause now I know that being sad sometimes is a part of it. It's an important part, because it makes the happy times, like right now, even more happy. And so, thank you. Merry Christmas. (mouthing words) (applause) And Lucy, can you join us please? (mouthing words) Please, Lucy? Ooh, what is it? It's a gift, from the whole town. So you can do Project Christmas Wish all year round. What? It's a charter for your first year of Project Wish. That's what we called it. It's the support you need to set it up as a non-profit, run it, and do what you love full-time, all year round. (whispering) Mom. I can't believe you did this! I didn't. Lucas did. Oh. No, no, no-no, not yet. Not yet. No, now is the perfect time. Cullen did something equally romantic but just a little more us. (violinist playing Silent Night) (laughing) What is this? It's your real wish. What are you doing? Why do you have a horse? It's a Christmas horse. I can see that, but why is it here? Because I feel like it's what you would've done. Go overboard. And it's my way of saying that I wanna go overboard with you. I mean, in moderation? That's so sweet. But, I'm not actually keeping the horse, am I? (whispering) This isn't about the horse. Lucy, I'm really sorry that I hurt you. And I get that you're scared. I'm scared too. But I think if we've been lucky enough to get struck by lightning twice, let's take it. Burns and all. ♪ (laughing) I knew that snow machine was clutch. Actually, the machine didn't work. ♪ What are you smiling about back there? I'm thinking about my Project Christmas Wish for next year. Uh-oh. (laughing) Come here. It's a perfect night. ♪
