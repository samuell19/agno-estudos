Oh, what day this is? The day that we meet And when I look at him, I felt different, whoa Dear Diary, did you know? Dear Diary, I think I love him But you and I only know Dear Diary, please keep my secrets No one has to know, whoa Because this secret is between you and me... [MUSIC ON TELEVISION] I love you. You're so cute! [SMOOCHES] You're beautiful! - Do you love me? - No! I've been calling you, you've been staring at the TV! I'm just taking a break. You haven't cleaned the garage. I've already lost my voice, reminding you to clean it. All you do is watch TV. Get up from there. The garage is not going anywhere. Want me to smack you, Badong? The older you get, the lazier you get. Be thankful that Ma'am Flora is sending you to school. But you haven't changed. I'm on vacation. I know. Didn't you promise your aunt that if you're on school break you will help out here in the house? Alright, fine. - What are you mumbling about? - Nothing! I'm just singing. Where are you going? The garage is that way. I'll just get changed. There you are again - Telling me what to do - This lazy kid. I don't know if I can take more of this Whatever Should I be the one– Sweetheart. Darling. Hey! Don't call me darling! Come on, sweetheart. Are you mad? She is mad. I should be mad. - Why are you the one who's angry? - Grace, I'm not angry. You're being too sensitive. Of course, you're angry, I can tell– Wait, someone is listening. Party line? For a while, please. I'm just using the phone. Party line, can you put the phone down, please. - Albie. - Can we talk next time, please? I still have to write my term paper. - How are we going to settle– - Bye! Why haven't you fixed your clothes? Nanny won't be able to do that anymore. I'm tired. You fought with your boyfriend again. He's just a friend, he's not my boyfriend. Whatever, fix your room by tomorrow morning. There's so much to do here. Please help out. May , . Dear Diary... I don't know how I feel as of the moment. Albie and I fought again. Sometimes I feel that he's so insensitive. Sometimes I feel... I'm only wasting my time... [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [YAWNING] Our lord is awake, Mercy. Good morning to you, my lord. Good morning to you, too. What time did you get home last night? I bet you were on the phone again. You know, aunt. Maybe you will have more money if you work as an announcer. Why don't you replace Noli De Castro? Don't play with me. If you don't want that coffee on your face. Auntie... Remove the curtains in Wally's room later. We will change it. But no one's using it. Ma'am Flora called long-distance this morning. Wally is coming home. When? Next week. We should get ready, I don't want Ma'am Flora to say anything bad. This house is fine. Wally is coming home! Yes. You'll have your sidekick again. Mercy, eat your breakfast quick and remove the curtains. And, Badong, Don't leave the house. I don't want to see you hanging out at Cion's house Mercy, the bathroom, have you cleaned it? Did you use a cleanser? Oh my, these kids! They're so lazy. I don't know what to do. - [WHOOPING] - It's like you're pulling weights. You're all laggards. [ON TV] I'm disowning you as my child! Get out! [SOBBING] Mom! Please, don't do this. I don't want you here! You've been giving us shame. - Please, mom. - You're a bad child. - We took care and guided you! - Mom! What about your father? Are you not concerned about him? Don't touch me! Get out of this house! - Oh, mom... - [SOBBING] Mom... [ENTICING MUSIC INTRO] [COMMERCIAL MUSIC PLAYING] If only we meet, you're mine. She's pretty. Enough, please. Enough. I'm done. I'm in love. Please, enough. [CHATTERING ON TV] - But why? - Didn't I tell you? I have so much to do. I still have to pick my dad up. You're being unreasonable. Are you avoiding me? Albie, will you be honest with me. - What's wrong with you? - Are you... Why can't you understand? - Excuse me. - There goes your party line again. It's an emergency. Party line, please. We are using the phone. Maybe I can use the phone, too. Just for a minute. Five minutes. Please. Damn it. Maybe Grace will be famous. I always see her when I watch TV. If I didn't convince her, she wouldn't do it. My classmates are making fun of me. They're just jealous. They won't even be good enough for a mosquito repellant commercial. Are you sure you don't want to join us? She's sad right now. She fought with her boyfriend. - Sis... - Isn't it true? Stop calling Albie my boyfriend. Fine, your best friend who's always striking a pose. Come on. You really don't want to come? - Okay. - Take care. What the– You son of a– - You startled me! - [SHUSHING] What are you doing? - Please go to sleep. - Why? What are you doing with the telephone? Please go. I'm just amusing myself. You're eavesdropping again, aren't you? They don't know anyways. You're violating people's privacy! Why don't you just go to bed? You pesky kid. Return that phone. If you break that, you're going to get it! I've had it. If you can't take me for what I am - maybe it's better– - It's better if what? - Say it! - Let's take a break. - That's what you want anyway. - Yes, it is. Goodnight. Albie? Albie... Hello? Albie! Albie! - Grace... - Albie? No... Who's this? I heard everything you were talking about... - Party line? - Your boyfriend is crazy. Were you listening to our conversation? What is he so proud of? He's too sensitive. Why were you listening? That was a private conversation. Because you were talking for so long. How dare you listen to a private conversation! I was just concerned. Don't be upset. Hello? Are you okay now? - Yes - Okay, go to sleep. Hey, wait, party line! Yes? - What's your name? - What? You know my name, but I don't know yours. What's your name? [STAMMERING] - Wally. - Wally? Alright, Grace, goodnight! Dear Diary... Something so strange happened just a few minutes ago. I think it's all over between Albie and me. But... Right after we talked on the phone, my party line suddenly spoke to me. I was so shocked! I mean, he was listening all along. His name is Wally. And he sounded really concerned. Wally... - I really don't know. - But you're a line, man. You would know who's sharing a party line. But I don't know who moved into that house. Why don't you see for yourself? Since it's still the same address. It's the same phone number. I can call that number, right? Different phones, but same line. I can call using our phone. I just need to call another number. Can I do that? Yes, you can. What number should I call so I can talk to our party line? [PHONE RINGING] - Hello? - Hello. Can I talk to Grace? This is Wally. Grace, it's for you. - Who is it? - Wally. Will take it in my room... - Who is that wally? - Don't worry about it. Please put the phone down. - Hello? - Hi! Hi! - Surprised? - You could say that. How did you know my number? I have my connections. Are you a Cojuangco? We're quite related... Hey, are you okay now? Yes. Have you guys talked? You're being nosy. I'm just concerned. - Oh, that's... - Huh? - I was just checking on you. - Wait, Wally. - What? - What do you look like? I'm human, too. With two feet, two hands, one body, one face two ears, two eyes, one nose, one mouth, two nose holes. - How many nose holes do you have? - You're being so vague. Maybe I want to see you. What? It's strange talking to you, when I don't know what you look like. Can we meet? Please, Wally? Sure. [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] Going somewhere? Where are you going? Are you visiting the daughter of Cion again? No, I'm all dressed up now because I want to impress you. Don't I smell good? Badong, you haven't cut the grass in the backyard. Hello, handsome. Cute! I'm here! Alright! ''Hello, Grace?'' Is this her house? Come what may. What if she ignores me? What if she's not here? No. Don't be scared. Remember, I look like Tom Cruise. - Ready? Here we go. - [DOORBELL RINGING] This is it. I should practice. [MUTTERING, CHUCKLING] Who are you looking for? - I'm looking for Grace. - Why? Huh? Why are you looking for Grace? Do I need a police clearance for that? Tetang! Who is it? - He's looking for you. - It's her. The girl of my dreams. Is it Wally? - I don't know. - I have to go. Hurry! Hey! Where are you going? Are you Wally? - No! He just sent me here. - What? Where is Wally? - He won't be able to make it. - Why? We made an agreement. - He has something to do. - Wait! Wait! Hey! Wait! Hold on! Hey, wait! Hold on, wait! Oh, no. Stupid! Stupid! You're so stupid, Badong! You're nuts, Badong! Why fall for a model? Grace is a model. She's a model. Stupid! Loser! You're a loser, Badong! Stupid! I didn't know. I didn't know. You're so stupid! So stupid, Badong! Hey! Where have you been? Why won't you answer me? Hey! You look like Tom Cruise... When you're just a nobody! You look like someone. Someone ugly. Pull over, please. Can you honk the horn? How much? Fifty bucks. Nanny! It's Wally! Here's the money. - Wally! - Nanny! - How are you? - You look so handsome! - Badong? - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Badong? Come out here. Badong! Get out! Badong! What a pest! I'm trying to rest. But you keep calling. Yes? There. What are you doing here? Don't I live here? - Oh, right! - [BOTH LAUGHING] You got here early. I couldn't find a flight in two weeks. I took a chance on a flight. Are you surprised? I have a lot of stories about your cousin. Nanny. Bro, do you have a girlfriend already? How many? Don't tell me that ever since I left, you haven't hooked up with anyone? Soon! Soon. Who is it? Is it Ludy? Let's go! Didn't I tell you, once I get back from the States, we will party? Come on! Get ready! Let's party! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Badong! Dance with us! If you want to go dizzy from dancing, go ahead. - Just leave me alone. - You're so rude, Badong! You asked me to go clubbing, I put on makeup, dressed up. Then you won't even dance with me. You're driving yourself nuts staring at the ceiling for lizards. Why can't you be like Wally? - Why don't you dance with him instead? - You bet! To hell with you, Badong! Come here! Dance with me! Why? Is she putting out? Why did you turn her down? Look at her! She's upset! It's not her. Wow! Look at you. You haven't hooked up with her. And yet there's another one already? Wait, it seems something's bothering you. - Tell me about it. - Bro, it's nothing but this. This face. Why? You don't look bad. Don't tell me you're doubting yourself? Badong, it runs in our family. - The Salcedos. - You're pulling my leg. Who would fall for this ordinary face? Who cares about looks, when you're a lawyer! You'll be the first lawyer in our family! You got this. I'm about to get mad. Why hasn't he called? He stood me up earlier. And to think I waited for him. I don't understand this. Why am I excited to see this Wally? I don't even know him. I only hear his voice [CLEARS THROAT] Hi, Grace! I'm a good dancer. [CHUCKLES] I feel stupid. This is stupid. I am stupid. I wish he would call. Wally, please call! Let me call her... No, maybe later. I wonder what she's doing? Hey! That won't bite. Who are you itching to call? Me? Call who? Who will I call? You've been itching to make a call. Itching? Yeah! Hey! I'm not itching to make a call! I'm just taking a break. Bro... No guts, no glory. Why? Is someone bothering you? Do you want to report them to PLDT? So they could change your party line? No. No one's bothering me. Why do you want to know who your party line is? I just want to. You know I'm quite sure it's someone here in your neighborhood. A lot of people live here. I don't want to go around asking people... where a certain Wally lives. But you know, we don't really need to go through PLDT. This is what you should do. Synchronize the time you both use the phone. Then talk to him! Ask him where he lives. - You should do that. - I don't want to do that. Can you help me? Please! Okay, fine. [BREAKING] Okay, Chuck. I'll see you in about fifteen minutes. Yeah. Bring all your blank tapes, okay? Okay, bye. See you. Our party line did not disturb you? Not at all... Is Mrs. Solis still alive? She moved to Alabang. We have a new party line. Really! That's better! - I'll head out. - Alright. Alright. Bro, remember... No guts, no glory! ''No guts, no glory!'' Right! Hey! - Don't tell me you're more tired than I am. - [PHONE RINGING] Hey, it's the phone ringing. I'll get it. - Hello? - Hi! - Are you upset? - Who wouldn't be? You said you were dropping by. Then you sent your sidekick who looked like a bug. Who is he? He's my bodyguard. Very funny. Is there a bodyguard, who's that skinny? So, when will I see you? One day... We'll see each other. You'll finally meet me. Wally, come on. Grace. See... You know, Grace... Look. Even before... My feelings for you are different. How can you say that? You haven't even seen me. You know, Grace... You can't beat the real thing You can't beat the feeling... - Hey, hey! - It's unfair! You already saw me, but I don't even know– I'll call again, okay? - Wally! - Bye, Grace! Wally! Wally! Hey! Who are you yelling at? That's the problem... I don't even know... Weird... I'm really pissed... Why does he do this to me? He calls up, then he disappears... It's bothering me. The more Wally acts mysterious the more I am determined to get to know him. I won't stop until I meet him. Besides... Grace! I have something for you... Compliments of PLDT. Thank you! Sit! Here are some snacks. Eat! You know I had to pull some strings to get that from PLDT? Number Buchanan Street? Isn't that in the next street? Didn't I tell you, your party line lives in your neighborhood? - Where are you going, Grace? - I'm going hunting! [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] Chuck, I'll call you... Bye! - Wally, let's meet at :! - Sure! Wally? - Yes? - I'm Grace! Hi! I'm Grace! - Yes? - You know, Grace... - Yes! - It's Grace! That's what you said. - Your party line! - Yeah? Hey! It's Grace! Aren't you Wally? I think so. - Why do you act surprised? - What do you expect? Wait. - Do I know you? - Do you know me? Does that question need an explanation? Don't tell me you don't know me? - That's why I'm asking you. - You jerk! - [GROANS] - Does it hurt? Now maybe you know me! - She's crazy. - You think so? It's not so bad... Do you know how heavy the bike was? And it hit me there! That woman is crazy! Badong, did you act like a jerk to that girl over the phone? You spend three hours talking with Cion's daughter. But, nanny... Why does she know me? Maybe you acted like the jerk, Wally? Hold on, nanny... I've never spoken to her over the phone. And... Why does she want to hurt me? And she expects me to know her. Hey, Badong, what's with that look? - You're not the one who's hurt. - [CHUCKLES] I know! But we're not only cousins, you know... We're best friends. That's why I sympathize with you. Toast? That's what you get for talking to strangers... He introduced himself to me first. And, Felix. Why did you have to give her the address of our party line? I didn't think she would actually look for him. And besides, she asked me nicely. - That's why I gave it to her. - [PHONE RINGING] Hey, there it goes again. - Why don't I talk to this guy? - No, Felix, let me do it. Grace! Sis, let me handle this... Don't you ever dare call me up again, you idiot! Did you hear that? I hate you! Asshole! Done! - [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] - Damn. How do I make it up to her? [SOBBING] - Wally, this is your last shot. - Okay. Thanks for bringing me here. It's so nice. What? What took you so long? Chuck, do you know them? No! That's enough! It still hurts. I do not know you! Look at you... The last time we saw each other, you were insisting that I know you. And now you don't know me? What is it, really? Shut up, or I'll mess your other foot! Enough! It still hurts! Wait... Oh, I'm sorry... Why are you so mad at me? Why don't you ask that to yourself? What did I do? I just got back from the States. What do you mean you just got back from the States? I'm trying to recall if I did something before I left. But... - I can't remember anything. - Are you sure? I was there for two months. I was only there for two months. Are you sure? Why? Isn't San Francisco in the States? - Who was I talking to on the phone? - Where? On the phone! Did you call long distance? I've been in San Francisco for a vacation. My parents are based in Oakland. Not exactly in San Francisco. How far is Oakland? You have to cross the Bay Bridge. Not that far from San Francisco. Maybe we can go together. My grandma lives there. When are you planning to go back? Well, as soon as my grandma sends me a ticket. I will fly right away. But I still don't understand. Understand what? Who was that Wally I was talking to? If it is the right address and you're my party line... Who was that? ''No guts, no glory''. - What? - Huh? It's nothing. Hey, wait for me. She's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful... Really? Yes! She's one-of-a-kind. I thought she ran you over with her bike? Bro, we've worked it out already. Imagine, there's another guy pretending to be me. Well, I have to thank him... If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met Grace. Right? - Yeah! - We're going out! - [LAUGHING] - What? - When? - I'm not sure yet. She's going to ask her mom. Can I ask you a favor? What is it? Chuck set me up on a date. But I prefer Grace. I don't want to ruin it with her. You know what I mean. What are you trying to say? How about you go, instead of me? What? Me? I get the reject? To cover for you? She's pretty, too! No thank you, Wally. Please, bro. Do it for me. It's going to be fancy, I have nothing to wear. Let me take care of it. Okay? Wally... Bro, no guts, no glory. Here, wear this! Bro, I look stupid! Of course not! Look! Admit it, I still look stupid! Bro, you look good. But... Still stupid. - Ouch. - I knew it. I thought you were on my side. Here, try this. Bro... Trust me, bro. - [MUMBLES] - [SCOFFS] Hey, you two. You shouldn't make your date wait. Your date is here. What? She's here? - Yes! - Who? Your date! She went here? Why? Do you have a car? - Hurry. - Hurry up! Go. - Let's go! - These kids. Hurry! - Hey, Badong! Hurry! - Hold on. I'm still getting ready. Hi, Wally! Hello, Grace! - You guys know each other, right? - Yeah, we've met. Oh, yes. Once. We were talking on the phone. Phone? When? - I don't think so. - Come on, bro. We all know what's going on. - What are you talking about? - Bro... Just drop it. It's so obvious. Why do you have to pretend to be someone else? What else can I say? Okay, you caught me... - Can I go back to my room now? - Hey, why? I can't look at you guys anymore without feeling embarrassed. How about our plans? - Plans? - Aren't we going out? What? Don't waste your outfit if you'll just watch TV. How about you guys go without me? Come on, bro... Grace, talk to him. Badong, you should come. Are you sure? Bro, what do you want me to do? Beg you? Come on! Destiny made fun of us We met over the phone I only hear your voice But since then, I grew fond of you Hello, party line? Hello? Please call me Hello, party line? Hello? I want to hear your voice again Every time you call, all my worries fade away With your sweet talks Why do I always feel giddy? Hello, party line? Hello? Please call me Hello, party line? Hello? I want to hear your voice again Hello, party line? Hello? Party line, hello? Just by thinking of you makes me happy Dear Diary... I think I have met two of the most wonderful boys in my life. Wally, the real Wally... - And this really sweet guy, Badong. - [PHONE RINGING] Hello? - BOTH: Hello, Grace? - [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - [TRAFFIC NOISES] - [CHATTERING IN DISTANCE] [MUMBLING] [CLEARS THROAT] Hi! - Hi! - Hi! Hi! - Hi. - Did you get hurt? No! Thank you. - By the way, are you new here? - Yeah. What school did you come from? I've never seen you before. Mandaluyong High. We moved somewhere near here. That's why we're going to school here. - ''We''? - My sister and I. I'm Matthew, by the way. - I'm Lenny. - Right. Oh, wait! Wait up! What year are you in? Third-year. - Third-year? We're the same! - I see! - What class? - Kamagong. [CLEARS THROAT] I'm in the Ipil-Ipil class. Do you know how to play chess? A little. Just a little? Would you like to join our chess club? If I don't get into the Glee club. I'm going to the audition now. Where is Balagtas building? There! Do you see the auditorium? - That auditorium... Behind that. - I see. - They're almost next to each other. - Oh, okay. Thanks. Okay. I can't forget the fate Let's put an end to happiness We will face eternity Because I will love you forever... - Thank you. - Welcome, sir! Next! - Lenny Tacorda. - Sir? [PIANO PLAYING] My love for you is true I want to prove it to you Don't hesitate Count on my love for you Like a glorious morning, Shining Life is short, my love So I will only show my true love forever My love won't fade away I will love you, forever [PIANO OUT OF KEY] - Sir? - [SOBBING] Sir! It's beautiful! Just beautiful. Just don't mind me. Don't mind me. You remind me of Pauline. She's the best soprano I've ever had. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Next. - You may sit down. - Thank you, sir. Mr. Macalintal is really weird. That's why no one wants to join the Glee club. Do you know Pauline? Pauline Carpio? Yeah. It was weird. I don't know... - Poor girl. She's handicapped. - What happened? She's been missing for two years. No one knows what happened to her. Sis! Sis! I thought you went home! We're still waiting for our teacher. Mr. Delgado. There he is! Well, what I can tell you is, study chapters five to eight. Matthew, my sister–Niña. - Hi! - Hi. Look, sis! Look at him! Who? Mr. Delgado. Our homeroom teacher. He's so cute! He looks like Edu Manzano. Let me introduce you to someone. My cousin–Bogs. He looks like Paquito Diaz Whatever! You know, we're good-looking. I don't want to talk about it. Really? - Bogs! - Hey! They're all mine! - Is that your cousin? - Yeah. I know him. He's my classmate. He's quite annoying. That's just how he is. He's a player. I'll see you, Matthew. Where do you guys live? In Carmel. That's really near. Let me bring you home. Okay, let's go. It's true what the agent said. This place has many advantages. Where else can you find a place that's near a church, a market, and a school? And there are so many good-looking teachers! Sis, don't you know? Especially Mr. Delgado. He's so cute! Geez... You're so fickle-minded! Didn't you say you didn't like this place before? That was before. Okay, this is our place... Oh, you guys got this place? Yeah. Do you know who lived here before? Pauline used to live there. Pauline? Who is Pauline? See you, Matthew. - Thanks for walking us home. - Alright. Sis, who is Pauline? Nothing. She was a student in our school... I see. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - One, two, there! Nice! - Wait, my turn next! - Take my photo, sis. - Take mom's photo. Let's go to the kitchen. Pretend I'm cooking. Mommy, we're out of film... Mommy's so unlucky! You mean, we're out of film? That ran out fast. Mommy, you had your photo taken in all the corners of the house. Okay, nevermind. Let's eat. But tomorrow, have the film printed. I want to send it to your dad. Oh, life. If your dad hasn't decided to work abroad, we would still be living in a small apartment. Mommy, did you know someone died in this house? What died? Who died? Hey! Stop it. Well, the agent said she just disappeared. The niece of the previous owner of the house. No one really knows what happened to her. Didn't they say Pauline died? Matthew even said she was raped before she was killed by a drug addict. That's all speculation. It could be true, or not. It's not true. There is no evidence that Pauline died. And especially not in this house. That's what the agent said, and I believe her. Well, this house we got at a very good deal. You won't see a house this big for three hundred fifty thousand. Even if someone died here, I don't care. People die in their houses all the time. I'm not scared of ghosts, mom. There are no ghosts here. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] ''Niña loves Bogs.'' ''Niña loves Bogs,'' what is this? Miss Tacorda, did you write this? No, sir! I did not write it! Sir, it's Bogs! Not me, sir! So young, and already so in love. - It wasn't me! - Stop it! - It really wasn't me! - Stop it, I said! I won't allow any acts of violence, or vandalism in my class. Mr. Quiroy, did you write this? - Yes, sir. - Then you deserve to be hit in the head. Sit down. Next time you write a love letter, use a stationary, and not a notebook. Ms. Tacorda. Here, use this. - No, it's okay, sir. - No. Come here. Anything else? No, thank you, sir. Want it? So, who is his favorite now? Who? Niña! Come here! - Why? - Come on, take a look! What is it? ''Niña loves Bogs''. Look, ''Niña loves Bogs''. [CHUCKLES] Oh, Niña! Oh, she's upset! - Niña, what will you do? - He'll see. There he is! [BOYS CHUCKLING] Won't you leave me alone? Why? I think she loves me. Love? Why did she hit you? Didn't they say? ''You only hurt the one you love''. [WHOOPING] There. February 1986, read it. She left her house on Valentine's day. She said she will attend choir practice. But according to Mr. Macalintal, the musical director, they didn't have any rehearsals. Why didn't she come home? What happened to her? It's a mystery behind Pauline Carpio's disappearance. Was there something good that happened to me today? - [ANXIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - [CREAKING] [YELPS] ''M.D. asked me to watch a movie with him tomorrow.'' ''Why not? He seems nice.'' M.D.? M.D. Stay away from me! [SOBBING] [GROWLING] Leave me alone, please. Have mercy on me, sir. No! [RINGING] Niña, whose hanky is that? - Oh, this? It's sir's. - Yes. Which sir? - Mr. Delgado. - What's his first name? Modesto, why? Modesto Delgado. M.D. Why? How did you get this? It's a long story. But he gave it to me yesterday! I will tell you about it later. Mommy might hear us. She won't be happy if she finds out. I'll keep it for a while. [HUMMING] Sis, you know what I think? I'm our teacher's favorite. Don't trust someone you hardly know. Who knows, he might be a pervert. Sis, he's a teacher. - Classmate! - Sis, wait here! It's sir! Yes, he's a good student. Oh, excuse me. Please, excuse me. I'll give his hanky back. Wait here. Good morning, ma'am. Hey, watch it! - You did it! - I didn't mean to. - You did it on purpose. - We both got hurt. - Give that to me. - Fine, I did it! Here! You did it on purpose! Sorry! [STUDENTS LAUGHING] ''He is the cutest, the smartest, the kindest.' - ''And the most handsome teacher–'' - Hey! - What? - That's Niña's. - How did you get this? - She dropped it. - She dropped it. - Give that to me! Take it. Bye! - ''He is the smartest, the kindest–'' - Wait! Not that one! - That's Niña's. - You told me to read it. Here, open it to February 13. You sure? - February what? - Thirteen. There. ''M.D. asked me to watch a movie with him tomorrow.'' ''Why not? He seems nice.'' M.D. is Pauline's secret date on Valentine's day. - Who's M.D.? - Who else? It's Mr. Modesto Delgado, our English teacher. How are you sure it's Mr. Delgado that Pauline's talking about? Turn it to February 4. - February 4? - Yes. February 4... ''E.T.'s birthday.'' - Who's E.T.? - E.T., ''English Teacher.'' Who's our English Teacher who has the initials M.D.? - It's Mr. Delgado. - So? We know who was with Pauline before she disappeared. - So? - Whatever happened to Pauline, Mr. Delgado would know, he might even be responsible for it. What do you mean? Pauline's been missing for two years. No calls, no letters. No one knows where she is. Nothing! Zero! Even her aunts have given up hope in finding her. And I suspect that she'll never come back. Because she's dead. But who killed her? Her valentine's date killed her. Mr. Delgado! - Are you talking about me, guys? - Yes, sir! I mean, we were just discussing my dream. - Yeah! My dream, sir. - Yes. - Really? - BOTH: Yes, sir. How morbid. You think he heard everything? The imagination of these young people can sometimes run wild. Imagine concocting a story where I am the rapist-killer of Pauline. I know the poor girl. She was infatuated with me. Well, who isn't Mr. Delgado? Well, as I was saying... where was I? - Someone was making up stories. - That person is Lenny Tacorda. Our student–she believes that she has solved the mystery, of Pauline's disappearance because of the diary. What does she care about Pauline? She doesn't know Pauline. Wait, aren't they the ones who moved into Pauline's house? [ANXIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - Niña, what's wrong? - My diary is missing! What? Wait. Bro, did you like what we watched earlier? - Bogs! You jerk! - Why? You're one nosy guy! Where's my diary? What diary? You tripped me on purpose so you can get my diary. Oh, your diary? Don't mess with me, I'm going to hit you! What? Why are you so mad? Because I know what you're up to. ''Mr. Delgado, you're the smartest, the kindest..." "The most handsome, and the sweetest.'' - I hate you! - Wait! I don't have your diary, it's with your sister. I wasn't able to catch you earlier. Not even a ''Thank you''? UNISON: Thank you, Bogs! Jerks! [STUDENTS CHATTERING] Niña, I've been looking for you, I have your diary. What? You dropped it when you crashed with Bogs. Why do you bring your diary to school? - Give it to me. - Hold on. It's missing. - What? - It's not here. Sis! Where did you lose it? I didn't lose it! It's missing! Niña, I know what happened. Your diary is not missing, someone stole it! - Bogs? - It's Mr. Delgado! Mr. Delgado? Why would he steal my diary? He doesn't want your diary! He wants this! - What is that? - Pauline's diary. I have to go see Matthew. Excuse me. Sis, my diary! - That one. Take your pick. - [ANXIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] That's made abroad. And you look good in it, you can pay the installment. Go ahead. I'll write down your name. It suits you. - I'll take this. - Sure. - I'll take this one. - That'll look good on you. You took something, too. A skirt. We'll talk later, it's already time. I will go, too. After the stormy rain, there's a rainbow waiting It won't be long until we see the end of darkness Darkness... In times of need, you won't need to be alone - There will be hope– - [BROKEN KEY, STUDENTS CLAMORING] - What's going on? - Why did he stop? - Beautiful! It's beautiful. - What's wrong? - Please, ignore me. - Sir, are you okay? Just ignore me. I just got carried away by Pauline's beautiful voice. She's the best soprano I've ever had. Pauline, I'm sorry. You may continue. - This is ridiculous! - But sir, that is Pauline's diary. I don't mean this diary. I mean your accusation against Mr. Delgado. But sir, his initials are in that diary! This is another person, not Mr. Delgado. Do you know what Mr. Delgado did on February 14, 1986? He killed Pauline, sir. On February , , Mr. Delgado got married in the San Sebastian church. It was his wedding that day. I was there and some of the faculty members were there. And after the reception, Mr. Delgado and his bride went up to Baguio and did not return to Manila until after one week. Do you think Mr. Delgado will have the time to kidnap Pauline while he is on honeymoon in Baguio? Oh, Ms. Tacorda. I think you're watching too many movies. - And as for you, Mr. Quiroy. - Sir? You should know better than wasting your time and intelligence in this– Lenny? Lenny. Ms. Tacorda! Sir, it's nothing, I'm just getting dizzy. - Are you sure you're feeling well? - I'm just feeling dizzy. Mr. Quiroy, you better take her to the clinic, the doctor is there. Let's go. Let me bring these. You shouldn't skip lunch, Ms. Tacorda. Go to the canteen and eat a sandwich. You're just hungry. Then buy this and take it. Huh? Thank you, doctor. Thank you, doc. [ANXIOUS MUSIC PLAYING] Lenny, why did you call me? Matthew, I know who M.D. is in Pauline's diary. It's Dr. Policarpio. Lenny, it's impossible, it's Dr. Policarpio. It can't be him. He's new here. He just started working here. And Pauline's diary isn't with you anymore. Leave it alone, it's with the principal. Don't worry about it. - I have a chess game today. - Chess? Sorry to bother you. Go play chess! [FIRE CRACKLING] Get in. I'll bring you home. No, it's okay, sir. I will just take the jeepney. Come on, I'm heading that way anyway. Why, are you scared of me? Thank you, sir. Okay. Pauline! This is for you. Thank you again, sir. I'll go ahead. - [STUDENTS CHATTERING] - Just study. Our exams were so hard yesterday. So hard to cheat! That's what you're good at! Oh, wait. - I left something in the room. - Okay. Excuse me. Are you the classmates of Pauline? - ALL: Yes, sir. - Can you give this to her? - Sure. - Thank you. [ALL WHOOPING] ''Dearest Pauline, these chocolates are sweet,'' ''but not sweeter than you.'' - Pauline. - Yes? What are these chocolates? With a love note. - Are you dating someone from school? - No, mommy. Who is this from? From my teacher. Who's this teacher? My professor. I'm his favorite. And he's like a father to me. Come on, sis. Is there a dad who gives chocolates? Hey, stop it! Don't put meaning into it. [DOORBELL DINGING] There's someone. - Sis, I'll take it. - Okay. - Good evening. - Good evening. Is Pauline here? Can you let her know I'm here? I'm her professor. Sis! Your teacher's here. Wow, roasted pig. Please come in! Good evening! Good evening, ma'am. Sir, what are you doing here? It's my birthday today. And I decided to celebrate it here. You know, I don't have any family here. Come sit with us. I'm going to get a plate. Sis, you're so lucky. You have chocolates, and a roasted pig, too. Ferdie! Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true Someday I'll wish upon a star And wake up where the clouds are far behind me Where troubles melt like lemon drops Away above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly Birds fly over the rainbow Why then, oh, why can't I? [SOBBING] Sir? Sir? Sir! Sir, what's wrong? It's beautiful! So beautiful! I remember my mom. She used to sing so beautifully, too. What happened to your mother? She's gone. They're all gone. I'm alone in this world. We're the same, sir. I miss my parents, too. But, I'm glad I met you. You know, you're my only friend in school. Thank you, Pauline. Thank you.

No. - [SCREAMS] - You're lying! - Sir, you're hurting me! - I can see it in your eyes. - Sir, it hurts! - You're scared! Let go of me! I thought you loved me! Right? Why? Why did you make me believe that you love me, too? Why? Pauline? Pauline, don't be afraid of me. I love you. I've been waiting for this night. [GROANS] You can't leave me!
