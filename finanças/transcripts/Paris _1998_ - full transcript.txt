- Good evening. - Hello. Sorry I'm late. It's OK. I wanted to meet you because I'm looking for a girl, a young lady for a movie, and I was hoping you could help. In what way? In finding the person. I do not know who it will be yet, but I... An actress? No. Maybe... someone we meet randomly in the street. Someone who doesn't do cinema. A woman we meet in the street? Someone we find in the street? It's your job. You know how to do it. I don't. I can't approach people... I can't explain to them... And in any case, I wouldn't be able to explain what I'm doing, since I do not know yet. I... I know I'm looking for someone. I know I want to make a movie with her. I vaguely know what I want, but it's still hazy. It's almost nothing. We can start making cinema with nothing, and then fill in the holes, and build something. What are your thoughts on this person? What does she look like? I don't know. That's why... I need you. I don't know. We'll search together, if you'd like. We'll look in crowded places. You want to work together? The two of us, in the street? Yes. I mean there's a part of the work I'll do alone, but... We'll be together most of the time. I'll have a small camera on me. I'll shoot the crowd. And... you'll approach... persons. You'll film during the search? Yes, or I'll film later in the day. It does not matter, as long as I have something to do. You could help me out. What kind of person I need? I don't know. It's got to be a surprise. Something you... Something I imagine? It's not much to work with. No, it's not about imagination. Try to... work with your intuition. I need something unexpected. I'll spend time with that person later to find out if she is the one I want. We'll meet many people. And when do you want to start working? Right away, if you are free. - Are you free? - Currently, yes. How long do you think this will take? A few days, a few weeks, I don't know. You'll be paid, naturally. Yes. We'll have to discuss. It depends on how long it would take. I can tell you how long it typically takes. Sure, we'll talk about it. - So we start Monday? - Tomorrow? Tomorrow. You want coffee? No. - Where do you live? - Marseille street. 15th arrondissement. - Did you order? - Not yet. Do you want to stop for the night? Are you tired? A little. We'll continue tomorrow. - 8 o'clock? - OK. 8:00 AM? Good morning. Should we try the arrivals area? You think you'll manage? You mean because of the schedule? We see so many people. It's a little dizzying. I'm using to looking at people, but... it's hard because there are so many, and they're all in a hurry. But it does not bother me. Does it bother you we haven't stopped anyone yet? Does it worry you? You're still forming ideas. You must be forming ideas. I don't know. If it was up to me... If I were on my own, I would have stopped people already. But for me... Stopping people is not a big deal for me. I just do it casually. I imagine it's different for you. Yes, it is hard to move on to the act itself. By stopping someone, you're taking the risk of her not being the right person. I don't believe in love at first sight, but I wish I did. Maybe it is the fact that they're in a rush that bothers you? The concern that you might be annoying them? Yes, that's true, but... I don't think I want to stop the search. For me, it's the most interesting part. However, I know we can't just... keep looking at people passing by. At some point, we'll have to stop someone. But based on what criteria? What differences? Is it a problem of space? Maybe we should think of another place. Any ideas? Crowded places, but where people are not in such a hurry? We can try... Les Halles, the big stores, the boulevards, the Champs-Élysées... It's full of tourists. There are also many people going back from work. The trains... The Halles is full of people doing nothing. I don't want that. I want a girl who is working. A girl who is occupied, who is not easily available. It meshes well with an idea of... reserve, in a way. A certain... You think we missed some chances? Not really. I think we've seen interesting persons, and we'll see many more. It's been rather... It's been rather encouraging. I think it is a question of determination. I feel we've seen interesting people, and we'll find more. What's... What's strange is to work with the person who will eventually create the images. You usually work alone? I do not usually interact with the people involved with the eventual movie shoot. The project is already thought through, and they're very specific in what kind of persons they need. It's the opposite of this. But I think I prefer it this way. We're starting with... exploring persons. It seems evident, but no one does it this way. Probably because it's unrealistic or impossible. Not at all. On the contrary. Ever since we started working together, I'm surprised, because it goes against what I've done before, and I find it... I'm surprised by... I'm enthusiastic. I think it's a great idea. Enthusiastic? I mean optimistic. What's strange is that there are two people looking at the same thing, and I wonder what my point of view can bring to the project. Usually, my gaze is passive. I usually watch people even when I am not working, but in this case, I feel my gaze can contribute, that it can complement yours. Our gazes are different though. We do not see things the same way. I don't know how they're different. - Maybe my gaze is a little more technical? - Yes, you're more precise. You "spot" people, while it's more general for me. My vision is more global, and therefore I see nothing, or not much. I don't know. It's somehow enigmatic. 'Precise' and 'technical' have a negative connotation. I don't feel I look at people technically. I think that I have the ability to look at them coldly. Our perspectives are different. Having a technical gaze is not negative. I need this... this professionalism. What's interesting is to understand if the fact that I am a woman searching for a young woman... Maybe that's it. Is it only because you're the one who will make the images, - or is it because you're a man? - That's very important. It's important because you... You can get away with things while I can't, because I am a man. Certain looks may be misinterpreted. Where does it lead? It's not just an issue of curiosity, of wondering how good you want to know a person, or knowing where it stops. We all form ideas about others and sometimes we want to go further. That's when it becomes complicated. Maybe that's natural, but sometimes it's confusing. - I don't understand. - Looking at people in a certain way, and knowing what to expect, what we'd like to discover, how far we want to go. When does it become complicated? It starts with what urges you to stop someone. That's when you question what made you choose her. The moment you have to talk to someone, it becomes complicated. It's when you decide you want to talk, when you realize she may be the one. But it's... it's at the level of this... That's where it is interesting to find out how we can both work together. I'm not used to working with someone either. But I've found that... that you're pleasant to work with. You're not burdensome at all. I find your presence... very encouraging. It helps me. I think it protects me, too, especially when I film. I don't know if you understand what I'm doing. Maybe you're bored. I'm not bored. I'm curious. I like to watch. Sometimes people don't understand what looking means. - You mean how image makers look at things? - Yes. I don't know if you understand, but... you're really not in the way. Sit at the front if you want. We're ready. Time for a coffee? There's a place nearby. I liked it. I liked the framing, and I thought you captured... both the crowd, and the people in the crowd. I found it really good. But maybe you should... reconsider what we discussed... regarding young actresses, because I think it might... I think it might be interesting, and it might surprise you, even though I know you're not... keen. No, I don't feel like cheating. It's not cheating. I am saying you should consider actresses for what they are. You know, they're girls... They're girls who are conscious of who they are, who are used to an external gaze, who know how to use their artifice. I want a simple girl, with no back story. I am talking about young actresses. I've seen some of their work, I've watched some plays they were in. You won't be committing to anything. You can just meet them. I'll present them, and we'll see. It's straightforward. I'll present the project in very general terms, so they won't come all ready to recite some text. It'll be just a casual meeting, face to face, in a coffeehouse maybe. Anyway, you mentioned you wanted to find out what you weren't interested in. - That might... - Help in eliminating ideas? Not necessary eliminate, otherwise I wouldn't have suggested it. It might go further than that. Maybe... You shouldn't go in with the a priori goal of eliminating something. It's worth a shot, I think. In case you feel like it... Do you know why I wanted to see you? You're making a movie, right? Yes, it's... a simple idea, a film... A portrait of a person, and I am looking for that person. - A young girl? - Yes. Anyone? A young girl. - Around 20? - I am not sure. And... What else... What's the story? Is it just a portrait... There's no story. So you'll know the story when you find the girl? It's the young girl's story? I'll follow that person, and I'll film her life. Where are you from? Amiens. I've been in Paris for a year and a half. I'm glad I moved here. I love being in Paris. Before that, I did theater in Amiens. And... Why did you decide to come here? I've taken theater lessons ever since I was a little girl. I took courses when I was 10, and then I studied at the Amiens conservatory, and then, I fell in love, I finished high school, - I was afraid, so I worked in a pharmacy. - Afraid of what? Afraid of becoming an actress. I was afraid... of becoming homeless, of failing and not being able to make a living. I did not think it was possible. Becoming an actress was a dream. I didn't think I could do it. And then, at the end of the year, I lost my mother. I was living with her. I lived with her all my life. And then I realized everything was possible. And your father? Oh, him. My parents got divorced when I was one, and... I only see him rarely. We don't have a good relationship. I don't see much of him. He used to give me a pension, but I told him to stop because I was making enough money. Before she died, my mother told me: 'You're foolish. You'll be stuck in a job you don't like, ' 'you'll be stuck with your boyfriend and a bunch of children.' 'You're not pursuing what you love'. She reproached me for not becoming an actress. - How did she die? - Car accident. It was unbelievable. And I knew it was going to happen. It sounds crazy, but I knew it. I always knew I'll never see her grow old. I could never imagine being an actress while my mother was around. I just couldn't. That's why, when she died, I felt everything was possible. I was her prisoner, because she was my despot. She had a strong hold on me. She was only 17 years older than me. One evening, she wanted to go out, and I was supposed to go out with her, but we had a big fight, and in order to punish me, she told me she was going out alone. I hung up the phone in tears, and she went out with a couple of her friends. Her friends were staying in a boat. They were driving back from the bar to the boat, about 400 meters, at 4:00 AM, going 45 miles per hour, and they lost control of the car, and it flipped, 50 meters away from the boat. The two guys in the front were fine because they had their seat belts on, but she was behind, in the middle, joking around with them. She got injured and died the next day. When I found out, I was completely numb. It's her death that made me realize I could now do anything I wanted. At the same time, I was crushed by guilt. But she pushed you towards acting. Yes, but at the same time, I felt... I felt crushed, because she was... she was like a god to me. She always put me down. She wanted me to do it, but I didn't feel I could. And... I think it's easier to settle your problems with your parents after they're dead. I think so. And... Things have been going better since she died. When I was little, I used to wish she were dead, like most children do. I thought I could do what I wanted if she died. And then it really happened. No more parents blocking the dreams of childhood. Do you see what I'm saying? So now, I can do anything I want. But it is obviously not true. No one can do everything. But I think that this illusion helps me a lot. If my mother were still alive, I wouldn't be in Paris. I'd still be in Lille, studying. I would have probably flunked. I would probably... I would be in school, studying political science, or something. Literature. She wouldn't have paid for a studio in Paris. I wouldn't have dared. It would not have been reasonable. - Where do you live? - The 9th arrondissement. First, I lived in a maid's room, but then I found an apartment, quite nice... It's on the 5th floor. An old couple lived there, and they moved to the 1st floor, so they leased it to me. I got the furniture from my mother's house, and moved it to the flat. It's a nice neighborhood. There's all sorts of people. - What street? - Bailly. - It's a small street. - I don't know it. Have you lived in the 9th? Yes. Same street? What kind of girl are you looking for? - I am not sure. - Is that so? Do you go to Strasbourg? - Yes. - How often? Once or twice a year. What do your parents do? My father is retired. My mother is a therapist. What did he do? He ran a store. A supermarket. - Is it important for the role? - Why not? - What supermarket? - Prix Unique. Tell me about your life. Where do you live? Currently in the 20th, and... my professional life? - No, your everyday life. - My everyday life? Well... It's a rather... big question. I'm going through many changes now, so... there is no set routine currently, so... It's strange to... to talk about my everyday life, when my everyday is in upheaval. But... I'd rather talk about my professional life. How is your apartment? I live at a friend's house. Why is that? I feel like I'm in a therapy session with my mother. How do you spend your days? Currently, I am working with the friend I live with. She is an actress, like me. I love her very much. And... Soon, we are going to... we're going to... restart a show we wrote together, and... I'm a little nervous. We can talk of something else. You surprised me. - I am sorry. - It's OK. Cheers. You like theater? I know next to nothing about it. Why do you want to make this movie? So it's a documentary? Let's just say it's a portrait. I see. And you don't... You don't... You have no story yet? No, I'll just follow the girl I chose. She will make the film. I see. Now, I need to... I need to know a little about you... You'll talk to me about yourself, your life... Talk to me about your life. I'll take a cigarette. I'm 25. I'm 25. My life... Fine. I used to have a dog called Calamity... No, your everyday life. I live in the 18th. Can I have a light please? I am an actress. - What are you playing now? - Psyché. I play Psyché's sister. It's a play by Corneille and Moliere. You can say it's a comic role. The two sisters are depressive, because Psyché is very pretty and attracts all the men, so they always come empty handed, so they are bitter and mean. It's a fun play. We wear crazy costumes and wigs, it's a lot of fun. And the language is beautiful, Alexandrines, octosyllables, decasyllables... Is this your first movie? Yes. Why do you want to make a documentary? I don't need to make fiction. When we look at you, it's never you we're looking at, - since you're playing someone. - Yes. - That's true. - So you feel safe. What are you thinking of? Where do you live? So you're not searching for anyone in particular? You have no specific ideas... No. The world is large. There are many people... Yes, many interesting people. What you tell me is interesting, but at the same time it makes me nervous, because it would complicate things if I worked with someone uncooperative. I need someone who would accept a gaze that's usually simple but that can be sometimes intrusive. You thought you'd be disappointed, but you weren't. It was strange. It had elements... It had elements of a romantic encounter. Seduction played a large part in it. It was not natural. You meet someone, you ask her to talk about herself, you're 10 inches away from each other. It's is a little disturbing. And since it's their profession, they go to work with it. It's challenging. They wanted to showcase themselves, so they opened up to me. In a way, it was beautiful. Let's search in the streets then. At least they'll be different. Maybe the stakes won't be as high. I am more at ease in the street. I am more at ease with reality. It's that substance that I want to get hold of. I am not used to this. It is not in my training to be presented with things so spontaneously. I am rather used to struggling with reality. I am used to having to put an effort to get to things. What I liked... I feel that there was a willingness to it. But anyway, we'll go to the street, and I think you'll ask me to stop someone. Yes, you will do that. Can I ask you a question? What kind of story will it be? There's no story. It's a portrait. I think. - You're not sure yet? - No, I'm still looking. Will it be about the train station? Or is this just a meeting place? It's easy to meet people here, but they're in a hurry. Commuting is stressful. For sure. I spend 2 hours commuting daily. Sometimes I miss the subway, other times the train doesn't come. It's annoying. Waiting irks me. Waiting is such a waste of time. I hate it. It pisses me off. So I smoke, but it's not a solution. It doesn't really help. - OK. - All done? Were you shopping? What did you buy? You want me to show you? I'm going to a wedding, so I bought an outfit. - My friends bought dresses, but I didn't. - Why not? I find dresses... They look nice in dresses, but I don't like them. I bought some pants, very nice. I like simple clothes. I keep it simple. And... Let me show you. Here's the top. With chains at the back. Very chic, very cute. - Whose marriage is it? - A close friend. She's getting married. She'll be so pretty. It's soon. April 5th. Do you get a discount? Yes, 15%. Do you often buy clothes? Yes, but usually not here. Galleries are a little... too expensive. I'm too honest. I'm going to get fired. I find that galleries almost double the prices. I find that... it's not... - Not good? - No. It's no good, but people like it anyway. They buy when it's expensive. If it's cheap, they won't buy it. Take our Christmas decoration. Each ornament ball was 82 francs, and the other gallery was selling 4 for 25 francs, and people bought the expensive ones. They didn't want to buy the cheaper ones. Why is that? It's a mentality. Galleries are supposed to be chic. They want to be stylish. When you shop in the galleries, it means that you're relatively rich, so that's the mentality. They're attracted to brand names. They're going to sue me. Do you feel like talking about something? - Like what? - I don't know. I'm just asking. I'm not sure. Excuse me. I work at Catimini to make some money, but I still collect my unemployment aid. - So you work at Catimini? - Yes, on the side. Don't tell anyone. Why did you tell me? Do you trust me so much? I'm afraid of nothing. Why wouldn't I tell you? - Maybe I shouldn't have told you. - No, don't worry about it. - I'm a little confused. - Confused? You seem so satisfied with yourself, although you had just told me that - you weren't doing so well. - Well, I have my ups and downs. That's why I go out. - What's confusing about that? - I wasn't criticizing. I don't know. - Is my life too complicated? - No, not at all. I think it's quite simple. I try not to complicate things. I know that many have it worse than me. I have a roof over my head, I have everything I need. Sure, I don't have a job, but I'm still young. I'll find something. Do I have a boyfriend? No. How come? - What? - Why don't you? Why not? - I have a boyfriend, but it's complicated. - Tell me. - No, it's too... - Come on. You don't have to go into details. I'll keep it to myself. I have a boyfriend, but... He is married. Is it hard to see him regularly? See him? No, I get to see him, but... I can't live my own life. I see no one else. I tried to live my own life, but I couldn't. He's always in my mind. What do you mean? I tried to share my life with someone else, but I couldn't. It didn't work out, because I only care about that married person. Since when? Since I was 16. - 6? - 16. - So seven years? - Yes. How does he reconcile his married life with your relationship? It's not easy. He has children, and... How often do you see each other? Every day. I won't lie. - How long? - Half an hour. Those 30 minutes are what's most important in my life. Where do you meet? He picks me up in his car. We stay in the car, or we go to my place. I don't care how much time we spend together, as long as I see him. - Ever ask him to leave his wife? - No, never. I don't want to break a couple like that. I wouldn't do that. And you won't leave him? I'll leave him one day, but I'm sure we'll be together again sometime. But I would never break a couple, especially with kids. Is that so important? For him or for me? - The idea of the couple... - Yes, I don't want to cause harm. I wouldn't hurt him. That's what my life is like. I make do. That's all that counts to me. That's enough. - He picks you up after work? - Yes, after his work, he comes by... We see each other in the morning... - At your place when your father is away? - When my mother is not around. Does she know? Of our relationship? No, I don't think so, although she knows him. She does not suspect that we have a relationship. - Are 30 minutes enough? - What? Are 30 minutes enough? One minute would be enough. I'm a student. - What's your major? - Economic and social administration. What's that? It's corporate management. Human resources. Recruiting, that kind of thing. I'm in my fourth year. I am also an aide in a children center, and a hostess in an agency. - That's your life's summary? - Yes. - Is that all? - Yes. We can stop if you want. What about you? Yes, that's me, a student trying to make a living. I just finished a corporate event where I was in a butterfly costume all day long. I was supposed to symbolize freedom. That was the theme of the stand. I met people, we talked a little, - about free choice. - Which company is it? It's a company that offers gift vouchers. They had a stand in an event. The theme was that their vouchers provide the freedom to choose what you want. So I played the butterfly all day. - In an expo? - Yes. - Where? - Palais Du Congres. Why are you at Saint Lazare? I am waiting for my train to go home. - Where? - Versailles. I live with my mom, and my brothers. My whole family's there. - So you do these jobs to make some money? - Yes. My parents have been divorced for a long time, and my mother does not make much money, so I have had to work since I was 15. We do what we can to get by. I've done some sales, I help in events. I just finished a 15-day event where I was helping as a hostess. That kind of thing. It helps in paying the bills. - What does your mother do? - She's a school librarian. She doesn't make much. What would I film in your home? What would you film? What would you film at my house? I don't know. I have no idea. If you follow me around, I'm sure you'll end up finding something interesting. I don't know what exactly. Something true, something sincere and spontaneous, I guess. I don't know. Well, we'll see. It's hard to summarize a life. You can see me at the center, where I work with children. Tell me about your latest disappointment, or bad experience. That would be in the romantic side of things. I am fresh out of a two-year relationship, with someone who was in a bad spot, who struggled a lot. Someone I love a lot, with a lot of potential. When did he leave you? I left him. Let's set the record straight. One month ago. How do you feel about that? I feel good, because it is the first time I am single. The first time since I was a little girl. I feel totally free. The world is mine. - Looking for someone? - No way. On the contrary. I am very content. - Did you live together? - No. That was a plus. - So it wasn't very... - Yes, it was. Why not? You don't have to live with someone to have a... serious relationship. Anyway, it wasn't possible. Neither of us was ready for that. No, we did not live together. That would have been a mistake. In hindsight, it is when someone eludes you that you chase after him. It doesn't mean you're ready, though. That's wrong. I'm happy we've met. - Are you married? - Yes. For a year and a half. Almost two. - How old are you? - 21. You married at 19? So young. You're never too young when you're in love. We met when I was 17, and we got married when I was 19. Was it your first love story? No, but it was the first serious one. I had two relationships before, then I met the right person. - How old is he? - 27. - What does he do? - He's in education administration. What does that mean? He helps the superintendent run a high school. He's an adjunct superintendent. - Close to your home? - Sorry? - Close to your home? - Yes. 5 or 6 Km away. He works near his home, contrary to me. I plan to work in the same field, eventually. - Why is that? - Why? Because of the summer vacation, and the more convenient schedule. I'll be more likely to work close to home, because there are schools in all neighborhoods. Currently it's subway/work/subway/sleep, which is unbearable. I'm having trouble with my husband because of this. We barely see each other, and we fight when we do. Chores pile up in the weekdays, and we fight on weekends, if I have the weekend free, that is. That's why I want a job that's nearer, so I can see him more. If we had the same job, then I'll get to see him all the time. - You need to spend time with him? - Yes. That's what marriage is for. Otherwise, I would have stayed single. What do we do on weekends? We work on our countryside house. We bought it recently. It needs a lot of work. We're trying to rebuild it bit by bit. That's our weekend. We also go shopping. - The usual things. - Where? Rochmont. We visit the family, my mother, his parents. We do that often. Sometimes we stay home and watch a movie. It's nice to be alone sometimes. What kind of movies? A little bit of everything. Action, karate, comedy. All kinds. - Are you happy? - Yes. Happy. I'll be even happier when I have a child. I am waiting for him to make up his mind. - So you're ready? - Yes, I would like it. I know I'm young, but I want to do it before I'm older. Why is he unsure? Because I don't have a full time job yet, and I'm waiting for my permanent employment contract. So, financially, we're a little squeezed. The difference in schedules is causing tension as well. Once we take care of this, he says he'll be ready. I need my contract. You've only been working part-time for two months here. - It's only temporary. - Yes, it's temporary. - I mean the tension between you two. - Yes, but it is hard anyway. Because of our schedule, we never see each other, so it is hard for us to - move our relationship forward. - You agree that's why you're struggling? Yes. Because of that, and also because of family problems. Like what? My brother-in-law does not get along with him at all. - With your husband? - Yes. He does not like my husband, but he likes me, so my husband thinks it's my fault. He thinks it's because of me. - Do you have any idea why? - No idea. I don't know why. First we thought it was because we didn't invite them to dinner once, but apparently that's not it. We have no idea why he's upset. My sister-in-law, my brother's girlfriend is also unfriendly, but she's a special case, she's a difficult person. Why? She's pretentious, she thinks... - Why is she upset with you? - I have no idea. She won't say, so... Maybe one day she'll tell us. We'll see. Yes, it' easier to... - clearly state things. - Yes, but... They wouldn't do it. Maybe they're afraid of the truth coming out. My brother has trouble with her family. He doesn't get along with her father. He's difficult. He's a catholic. It's God and nothing else with him. Where is your father? My parents are divorced. He lives with his girlfriend, and their two children. - Do you see him often? - Not at all. Why? He worked where I used to work, and he told me I was bad at my job. He said I was the source of all the trouble, so I didn't like that. He called my husband an idiot, and I didn't like that either. So I decided not to speak to him again. I no longer call him, and my mother does not help matters either. That why I don't see him. - And you mother? - I see her everyday. She lives nearby. - What does she do? - She works in a preschool. She's single. She lives alone. That's why why we visit her often. She visits us often too. We bring her along to the countryside. One day I'll move away. I won't live near her forever. It's a tough situation. You hope she remarries? I hope so, but since she has a difficult personality, it's unlikely. She was with someone I liked, but she couldn't make it last. What are you doing here? Nothing specific. I walk around, I go in the shops, I sit on a bench, I smoke. - Why the station? - Because it's crowded here. The station is alive with people. I guess parks are nice too, but I like it here. I don't know. It's... People here pass you by without looking at you. They don't pay attention to you. You can spend a long time undisturbed. I don't know. You come to a crowded place to be alone? For... Yes, I guess. I like to be part of a crowd and... be invisible at the same time. I don't know how to explain it. - Do you come here often? - Yes. Yes, I love this station. No, not every day. Sometimes I stop by just to have coffee. It helps take my mind off things. Why Saint Lazare? I think it's the nicest station. Montparnasse, Lyon, Est, Gare Du Nord are just not the same. It's not the same atmosphere. It's more noisy. This one is different. - That's unexpected. - Yes. Do you have a boyfriend? Kind of. Meaning? Yes. We've been together for a while, but we're not really... It doesn't feel we've been together long. That's how it is. It's not love. What is it then? Affection, I guess. It's only affection. This is kind of depressing. I'm sorry. So... I don't know if you were told. I am making a movie, a portrait of a person, a young woman. What do you think of that? I'll follow the person I choose with a small camera, more or less discretely. But it will still be quite intrusive. Do you think such a project is feasible? - Is it interesting? - Yes, it's interesting. - No, interesting to me. - I don't know. It's not for me to... I don't know. It's not my place to tell you if it will be interesting for you to follow me around. I'm not sure... If you spend the day watching TV, it won't be very interesting, but in order for me to be interested enough in a person to film her in her social surroundings for many weeks, I have to know a little about her to get interested. Sure. That's why I'm asking you questions. I don't need secrets, just general things. Listen, it's hard to talk about one's personal life like that. It's not easy, especially for me. What can you share with me? Honestly, nothing. I've always found it hard to talk about myself, especially in such circumstances. Your everyday life... I also think you're overly aggressive. You're not good at this. - Is that right? - Yes. I should take lessons. Sure, especially if you want to make such a movie. How am I supposed to ask you questions then? How to ask them? - I don't know, but I feel you're upset. - No, I'm not upset. On the contrary. I'm willing to wait. I can be patient. Why do you want to make such a movie? Follow someone's daily life? Why? I don't know. - Isn't there someone you know who... - I can't do that with someone I know. That's not possible. I can't... I can't feel the desire to explore with someone I know well. I don't know. It's like a mirage. We always... What's elusive, what's elsewhere is always more... more precious, it has more value. Do you know what I mean? What is within our reach is never interesting enough. I wish I could be clearer. - Everything OK? - Sure, but... Do you think you'll ever finish it? Or will you drop those images? Those images are nothing. No, I... The moment has passed. Maybe some day... I'll get back to it, but the thrill is gone. For me, compared to other projects I've worked on, what I liked about it is the way we were looking for persons, not just faces, to imagine what an encounter might look like. Not with me, but with someone else. It was a little unusual, but I found it interesting. I liked it. Where are you heading? I'll work for a German newscast. - Is it for long? - One month. That's good, no? It's good because it's something I know how to do. Leaving is never easy. Because of the danger? No, once you're there, it's fine. But leaving is always hard. I think it's good. The experience was different for me. But what is left of it? Not much. How so? What remains of these encounters? None of these girls remembers me anymore. That wasn't the goal though. No, it wasn't the goal. But it's... How to say it? It's hard when you like solitude but you don't like being alone. Goodbye. Thanks. SUBTITLES BY KANAFANI
