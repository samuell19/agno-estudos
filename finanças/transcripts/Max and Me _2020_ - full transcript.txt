And this is me. This is the real me, Geordie. Good morning, my future leaders, artists, and activists. My new English teacher asked us to write a great American novel about ourselves. "Tom Sawyer" is over 300 pages of insane adventures. I find I'm lacking material. I mean, I haven't done anything remotely insane or adventurous. I've always thought of myself as exceptionally ordinary in the most un-extraordinary way. These are my parents. One of my moms is a health educator who travels the world teaching rural towns birth and sex ed. And my other mom is a yoga instructor and reiki practitioner. Breathe the fire within you. Oh, and I have a cat named Cat, and that's my family. We just moved here. We've had to move a lot because of my mom's job. I was homeschooled as a kid and then went to three different high schools since we moved back to America, all equally terrifying and contained the exact same unfriendly, bully-ridden, clique-divided student body. I guess there's not much else to know about me. I like board games, classic movies, Indian food, the color green, oh, and this is the love of my life. I haven't met her yet, and I don't even know her name. I have a really good feeling about this school. I read a lot of reviews. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. And they have a great art department. Oh. We're in the year of the dog, which means big things. Are you excited? - Yeah. - All right. Do you have everything you need, notebooks, pens? Yeah, I'm okay. I got everything. You're okay? Just a little nervous, but I'll be fine. Mm, nervous and excitement, it's the same... - The same feeling, yeah. - 'Kay, you're gonna be great. Call if you need us to come to pick you up, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Bye. We love you. - Bye. - Bye. ♪ ...on our own ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ See how far we can go ♪ ♪ I've got a hole to fill ♪ ♪ It's in the shape of you ♪ ♪ Dirt under my nails ♪ ♪ Strings coming loose ♪ ♪ Oh, hey ♪ ♪ Set out on our own ♪ ♪ Hey, see how far we can go ♪ ♪ See how far we can go ♪ Hey. Uh, you know, that's some sophisticated humor, but don't you think it'll hurt the feelings of whoever, you know, the locker belongs to? - Uh, that's the point. - I see. Um, maybe you guys, uh, shouldn't do that. Excuse me? Oh, hey, don't worry about it. No, in here. Hey, would you mind opening the door up? - Uh. - Thanks. - Are you okay, man? - Yeah, I'm great. I'm fine. I'm totally used to it. Name's Finn. Nice to meet you. I'm Geordie. You're new-ish, right? Uh, yeah, just... just moved in. Ah. Well, welcome. Oh, God, I'm so excited. Why? Well, you know how in every high school coming-of-age movie there's that one iconic scene that explains all the cliques? You know, like the geeks, the jocks, the cool kids? Yeah, well, we're about to have that moment. Come with me, my friend. First we have the hipsters. They tend to wear beanies, drink matcha-flavored everything, always on Tumblr, and for some reason obsessed with fall. If you haven't found them already, too, the bathrooms are right here, although the ones upstairs you don't need a hazmat suit for. - Good to know. - These are the surfer kids. They may look like bums, but don't let them deceive you. They all live in Malibu beach houses, wake up at the crack of dawn every day before school to shred the waves. There's the vegan hippies, the activists. Can't forget the celebrities. You're taking notes, right? Uh... - Any questions? - Um, yeah. What group are we in? Well, I'm glad you asked. You and me are the lone wolves with undiscovered potential. We're the kids that everyone picks on in high school, but then we grow up to be super attractive and successful, and then they regret the way they treated us. Oh, okay, cool. And right there is the love of my life, Judy Andrews, the most beautiful girl in the whole world. Good morning, Judy. How are you today? We're twin flames. She just doesn't know it yet. It's a work in progress. So you have any girls or guys you wanna date? Oh, uh, no. Wait, are you already dating someone or... Well, I mean, not exactly. Or not at all. But I am in love. - Wow, man. Congratulations. - Yeah, thanks. - So what's their name? - It's, um... Um... I actually don't know. Mm. Well, as wise old Bill once said, a rose by another name would smell as sweet. But how do you not know their name? Oh, well, we haven't really been fully introduced. I've just kinda seen her from a distance. Okay. Well, maybe she goes to this school. What's she like? Oh, God, she's beautiful. She has the most amazing energy, shorter hair, and she just kinda glows, you know? Hmm. Well, that narrows it down a little bit, but not by much. Mm-hmm. Here's what you gotta do, and listen to me because I have a lot of experiences in these situations. Okay. You have to go up to her and talk to her. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right. You could say hi. You could even tell her your name. Yeah. Thanks, man. Yeah. Good luck, my dude. Here we are, back at your locker. Yeah, I couldn't figure out how to get it open earlier. All right, that's 'cause you gotta bang on it first. Good for getting pent-up anger out. Hey, what's that? Dude, this is epic. Somebody likes you! - Th-th-that's crazy. - Yeah, okay, stud. It's time to get to class. You know what? Something's telling me that this year's gonna be a good one for you. Just do it. Just go talk to her. No, no. Morning. - Mm, morning. - Hi. - Hi. I'm making breakfast. - Morning, baby. - Morning. - Oh, avocados went bad. Geordie, would you mind running to the neighbor's and asking if we can borrow one? Any neighbor? Whosever home and seems like they buy organic. Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, just give me a second. Okay. All right, all right. Here we go. You don't have to get all dressed up to go get an avocado! Geordie! One sec! Come on, babe! Avocado, got it. What was that? Hello? Hi. Um, I was wondering if I could borrow an avocado. Well, not borrow, because after we use it, we can't really give it back. Um, I'm your new neighbor, Geordie. So nice to meet you. I'm Willow. I've been meaning to pop over and introduce myself. Come in. I'll get you an avocado. Here you go. - Thank you so much. - Please tell your family I'd love to have you all over for dinner this week. That's really nice. Thank you. Uh, so I was... since I'm new to the neighborhood, I was just wondering if you had any kids around my age. No, I don't. Are you sure? Yes. Really? Excuse me? It's just that I thought a girl around my age lived here. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I'm really sorry. Do you need my help? I can go. Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to upset you in any way. I know. I'm sorry I scared you. It's just that I do... I did have a daughter. She passed away last year. I... I am so sorry. How did you know about her? Didn't you just move in? Oh, uh, yes, just someone in the neighborhood told me that there was a kid around my age who lived next door. Oh. Well, I'm happy that you moved here. You bring a... a new, youthful light to the neighborhood. Hello, ladies. Uh, how you doing today? Okay, great. Look, I was wondering if any of you knew about a girl who passed away last year. I think she might have gone to this school. You mean the girl with the oxygen tank? What do you mean? Um, she had a disease. She needed an oxygen tank to help her breathe. The school had a big memorial when she died. We decorated a whole wall. It's still up around back. Thank you so much. Uh, have a great day. This doesn't make any sense. Hey, I'm Max. I'm 15 years old, and I have cystic fibrosis. I started this blog to hopefully inspire other CFers and people living with health issues, debunk some myths about dying and death, and show you that just because you may be living with a disease doesn't mean your life can't be seriously amazing and full of crazy adventures. I definitely feel like I really try and appreciate every moment and live in the now. So when I was younger, my mom and I made a bucket list, which sounds super cheesy, so we call it my life list, and it's full of crazy adventures and also just daily life stuff that I wanna make sure that I really appreciate. So make yourself a life list of all the things you wanna do and see and experience 'cause every second has the potential to be the greatest second of your life. So what's something on your life list? Hey, uh, who was at the door? No one was there, but they left a note for you. Um, who's it from? Someone named Max. Is Max a new friend? What's he like? Hello? Do you know him from school? Hello? Okay, well, I told you that you would make friends quickly here. "Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face. "Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that "which thou hast heard me speak tonight. "Fain would I dwell on form, fain, "fain deny what I have spoke, but farewell, compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say ay." Have a magical day, class! Hi. Um, hi. Wow. I'm sorry. It's just that, um, everybody said, and I just thought that, um... Hi. Yeah, it's true. I died. Wow, that's strange. Yeah. You get used to it. Interesting. I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to... you know, I just... I mean, I don't... I don't know how I'm... gah. Uh... I'm Geordie. It's really, really nice to meet you. I'm Max. Welcome to the neighborhood. You have no idea how nice it is to have someone who can see me. I'm the only one? Why can't other people see you? 'Cause I'm dead, silly. Right. So do you see ghosts all the time, or... No, no, this is definitely a first. Ghost virgin, wow. Interesting. It's definitely interesting. Wow, just... just, you know, wow. I know. So can I come over to your house? Oh, y-y-yeah, definitely, sure, yeah. Great. This way. Hi. Hi, Mom. Are you okay? You look weird. What? No. I'm fine. - No, yeah. - Are you feeling all right? Just peachy, you know? No, your aura's off. No, I'm... we're just gonna go... I'm... I'm just gonna go upstairs, so. - Just... this way. - All right. Catch you later. Oh, I really like your room. Sorry about the mess. Oh, don't worry about it. Hey, you have a pretty good view of my house. Do you spy on me from here? No. I mean, I've seen you a few times, but just at glances, not in, like, a creepy, voyeuristic, "Rear Window" kind of way. Kitty. Hi. My cat can see ghosts? Oh, yeah, all animals can, but humans are told from such a young age that ghosts aren't real, so we tend to block them out. Hi. Oh. That's cool. Here you go. Good girl. What is that? If you don't mind me asking. My third lung. It gives me oxygen. I have cystic fibrosis, so my lungs fill up with mucus, and I'm basically kind of drowning 24-7. Oh, gosh, I'm... I'm sorry. Oh, no, don't be sorry. Everyone has their cross to bear. Wow, you're... you're really wise. Oh, wow, you've been to so many cool places. Bet you've had some wild adventures. Not really. I kinda try to avoid the wild adventures. There's a lot of animals that can eat you. Ooh, a love note? Who's this from? Um, I actually don't know. I found it in my locker when I started school. - How romantic and mysterious. - Yeah. Nah, it's probably just somebody messing around. Somebody likes you. Well, I better be off. Oh, um, okay, yeah. Uh, thanks for, uh, coming by or... I had a really nice time. It was nice meeting you. Um, if you ever want to do this again, you know, in the near future, uh, we're pretty close, so. - Yeah. - It's convenient. Yeah. It was great meeting you too. It's awesome to know someone who can see me. I can find my way out. - Okay. - See you. Bye. Oh, and, uh, enjoy spying on me from your window, sticky beak. I will. I mean, no, no, I won't do that 'cause that's not what I do. Anymore. She is incredible. And a ghost. Oh, boy. - Hey, man. How are you? - Hey, man. Uh, I'm doing good. Actually, I'm pretty great. Yeah? Well, you look great. Hey, I think I found you the perfect match: Hillary Gilden. She's the soccer captain, and, well, she didn't scowl or anything when I, uh, mentioned your name, so I think she's a real contender. Uh, you know, thanks, man, but I think I'm good. Wait, what do you mean, you're good? Did you meet someone already? Dude, are you dating someone? Okay, no, no, we're not dating fully yet, but, uh, we're pretty close, I think. I mean, I finally talked to her, you know? So that's a pretty big step for the relationship, and, uh, she's amazing. That's fantastic, man. Congratulations. You should be really proud of yourself. Yeah, thanks. So does she go to the school? Oh, well, she used to, but she, um... she transferred. - Hey, maybe I know her. - No, no, no, you didn't. Uh, I don't think you did, I mean. Yeah. Well, I can't wait to meet her. I gotta run, so catch you later, man.

How was school? - It was good. - Why are you wet? Oh, uh, somebody spilled water on my head. All right. Do you have a lot of homework tonight? Uh, yeah, I'm swamped. - Okay. - Why? Uh, just the neighbors across the street invited us over for dinner. I can always tell them we can do it another night. No, no, you... don't... don't do that. I actually... what do you know? I actually don't have that much homework. I can go. Uh, that's really nice of them to invite us. Yeah. ♪ I think I could try with you ♪ Hi. Welcome. ♪ Feet don't always touch the ground ♪ - Well, you look dashing. - Thank you. Oh, lovely. ♪ Always touch the ground ♪ - You look nervous. - Me? No, I'm cool as a cucumber. There's nothing to be scared about. It's not like the house is haunted. That was smart. Am I the only one who knows you're here? Uh, just you and Henry. Wow, Henry really likes you. He's not like that with everyone. He's normally really shy around new people. Oh, yeah, he's such a sweet dog. Well, Geordie, you are welcome to take Henry for a walk anytime. Aww. Come on. So how have you been? Oh, good, really well, thank you. - How about you? - I'm great, yeah. Geordie, who are you talking to, an imaginary friend? - What? - What? - What? Huh? - No. No? Really? He's actually been talking to himself ever since he was little. - Mm-hmm. - I keep telling myself that it's a sign of genius, but it very well could be a sign of insanity. So how long have you lived here? About, um... - 16 years. - Yes. It's such a lovely home, great neighborhood. We're really glad we moved here. - What brings you here? - Oh, um, I work for an organization that teaches birthing education and sex ed and, you know, tries to help lower the maternal death rate substantially, so we get uprooted quite a bit, and poor Geordie, he's taken the brunt of it, you know, with all the new schools, but I think... I think I can say that we're gonna be staying in this town for quite a bit. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, it's a fantastic place to raise kids and a great school system. Do you have kids? - Oh! - Oh, my gosh! Wow, I mean, you know, you think that they're grown and you're done raising them, and then... we're always gonna have a job. No, no, no, it's fine. Um, I'm... I'm fine. I'm just... - I'm gonna use the bathroom. - Okay. It's right over there, sweetie. 'Kay, thank you. Oh, boy. Entertaining night so far. So what's up? I'm sweating like... I mean, I'm just really nervous. Why? I get really nervous around you, 'cause of the whole ghost thing. Relax. It's fine. - What if they find out? - They won't. Adults tend not to believe in ghosts, so they rationalize the irrational. How many times throughout history have parents told their kids that there's nothing under their beds? Wait, that's not true? What's under my bed? Intense birth. Tia was a badass. I mean, her cervix swelled because of the pressure of his old big head. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, and after a very slow descent phase, you know, he crowned, and we had a little problem with shoulder dystocia, but once we got a handle on that, I mean, he was just born. - Mm-hmm. - Just a perfect, 12-pound baby boy. - Mm. - And look what - they grow up into. - Yeah. - Wow. - And it was a home birth? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. We were living in Australia at the time, and we had this amazing aboriginal healer who guided us spiritually through the whole birth. It was pretty awesome. You know, I'm sorry, what was it that we were talking about before the whole wine chaos thing? Wasn't it... we were asking about kids, right? - Mom. - Yes? Have you tried the, uh, spinach salad yet? It's really... it's really good. It's really good. I know. I had some. We had a daughter. But she passed away last year. Oh, you guys, I'm so sorry. Wow. - Wow. - I'm sorry. We had no idea. You two are unbelievably strong. Thank you. - How about dessert? - Sure. Yeah, sure. Are you okay? Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just annoying 'cause I made them promise not to be depressed when I died. Pretty sure that's kind of a hard promise to keep. I subscribed them to a grief counseling brochure a few months ago, but they never read it. I keep pulling it out of the trash and leaving it where they'll find it, but. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Bless you. - Pardon? - Oh, uh, sorry. Nothing. - Dessert. - Wow. - Mmm. - Yum. - Wonderful. - Thank you. - Those are my favorite. - Do you want one? - I can't really eat... ghost... but they're insanely good. You're gonna die. Well, hopefully not really. - All righty then. - You okay? - Too much brownie for you. - Jeez. What nice people. Oh, gosh, did you know about their daughter? - That's so painful. - Yes. Yes, I did. Then why didn't you stop me when I was trying to bring it up? Well, that's why I spilled the wine and I was being so awkward. It was a diversion. - We need a better code system. - I guess so. How am I supposed to tell the difference between your normal awkwardness and when you're trying to give me a signal?

Why, yes, they are. - Oh. - How weird. Well, uh, have a nice day. You're such a polite young man. Thank you. Uh, goodbye. Thanks for waiting. She's always losing stuff. Hey. Hi. You look really nice today. Oh, thanks. So the plan for today is I'm coming to school with you. Th-that's awesome. It's so cool to be back. - You missed school? - Oh, yeah. It's one of those things, I guess, where once it's taken away from you, you realize how much you really loved it. I couldn't go to school for long periods of time when I'd get really sick, so whenever I was healthy enough to come, I did, and I soaked it up. Man, I'm... Who you talking to, Geordie? Um... no one, sorry. It's okay. You mind coming up to the board, helping me finish, write out these equations? - Sure. - I'm sorry. It's all good, man. You got this. That one's actually incorrect, but don't worry, man. Just give it another try. Hey, hey, easy. - Hey, you got this, Geordie. - Sorry. I meant... It's 18x plus 5... minus 18x... plus 36... equals negative 31. That's correct. I mean, it's... it's all correct. Nice job, Geordie. Good stuff. Thanks, math genius. You're welcome, ghost whisperer. This was definitely one of the best days of school ever. Oh, he was a friend of mine. So was she. I had a huge crush on that guy. That girl visited me in the hospital once. You had a lot of good friends. Trust me, I had my fair share of bullies too. Those kids over there are brutal, but I feel bad for them because you know their life must be miserable. Zeke's parents aren't nice. He came to school one day covered in bruises. So who are your friends? Uh, well, there's this one kid, Finn, and, um, you... and, uh... that's about it. I pretty much scared all the other kids. You grew up with dingoes on the Outback. A few high schoolers should be nothing to you. Yeah, trust me, they're much scarier. Oh, hey, look. It's moving. I think my hand's just shaking. Are there any spirits here? No way. Yes? U... R... N... E... X... T. You're next? What does that even mean? It's... it can't be good. JK? What does that mean? Just kidding? Mm, maybe it's a funny ghost? It has a sense of humor, that's for sure. I hope I didn't scare them too badly. I think you did, from all the yelling. Oh, you know what? I just realized that there's this tree back this way that I want to show you, so we should turn around and... and not go towards all that stuff. No, it's okay, Geordie. I never saw this. You know, a lot of people really miss you. And love you. Hanging around dead freaks 'cause you can't make any real friends? Hey, why don't you have some respect, huh? Oh, have some respect. - Loser. - Let's go. Who are you talking to, one of your imaginary friends? You know what? I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry that you only feel powerful when you bully other people. I can only hope that when you grow up, move out, and make some real friends, you realize life's a lot better when you're kind to people. Hmm. You were seriously amazing. That was one of the bravest things I've ever seen. Hi. Just made a smoothie. Oh, what happened? - What? - To your nose. Oh, uh, I got punched, but, uh... What? Oh, my God, baby, l... arnica, you want some arnica? - No. - Or some rose quartz? I need to call the principal. - No, no, Mom. - Yes. It's fine. It's fine. Look, I'm just gonna go and get cleaned up, and, you know, I was thinking about going to walk the neighbor's dog, so, uh. - Really? - I'm fine. I'm fine, I promise. So how come I only see you and not a bunch of other ghosts everywhere? I don't know, 'cause they're everywhere. So, um, what's it feel like to be a ghost? Pretty normal, actually. Slightly weird, sometimes scary. What does it feel like to be you? Kind of exactly the same, but what I mean is, were you angry or sad that it happened? I could have been angry and sad my whole life at the cards I was dealt, but then I would have missed out on all the good things while I had them. You're so wise. I feel like I gotta write down the stuff you say, you know? I mean, you could put all of this on your blog. You saw my blog? You cyber-stalked me? Yeah. What'd you think? It was amazing. I mean, you're the bravest person in the world to be able to be so honest and not afraid to tell people about your story. I was really nervous when I first started, but if sharing my life can help someone else, then it's worth it. Anyway, I have this kind of crazy idea, but I need your help. - I love crazy ideas. - When I was alive, I made a list of everything I wanted to do in my life, and I wasn't well enough to finish everything, and I kind of feel like this is my opportunity to do all the things that I was too sick to before, and I want to do them with you, Geordie. Uh, yeah, yeah. I'd love to. What's wrong? I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to. No, no, it's not that. It's just, you know, I would love to do all that with you, but does this feel like you're, you know, taking care of unfinished business or... Well, I never finished it, so I guess, yeah. Right. So, uh, what's on the list? Wow. That's quite a list. Horseback riding, that's terrifying. Go to a high school party, that's... that's more terrifying. Yeah, I think we can check some of that off the list, obviously not travel the world, but we can do a lot of this. Oh, um, there's a piece ripped off. What was the last on the list? The secret grand finale. You'll find out what it is eventually. Oh, no, I'm scared. I'm really not good with surprises. Fear is only a state of mind. ♪ Cannot stop the feeling ♪ First thing on the list, tomorrow after school? - Yeah. - Bye. Bye. ♪ ...revealing ♪ ♪ What I won ♪ ♪ You lost the fight ♪ ♪ What I won ♪ Ghost are the leftover angelic spirits of physical beings who have passed away. These energies are supposed to pass into the light, but sometimes they get caught in our world. They're here because they have either died of a very traumatic death or they have not yet resolved all of those things that keep them from passing over. Their job is to heal their issues, then pass over into the light. Hello? Madame Cocolita speaking. Hello, uh, my name's Geordie, and I was wondering if you could answer a question that I have about ghosts. Oh, of course, darling. Well, um, do all ghosts go into the light? Some don't, and some stay trapped here because they have not resolved the issues that are keeping them from going into the light, so the best thing they can do is to heal those issues and then cross over. Um, but what if a ghost is... happy here and doesn't need to... cross over? Well, some could be good and happy, but they deserve to go over. They do. Trust me. If they're here, hmm, there's a reason for that. Um, okay. Just... just one more thing, just so I'm clear. There's no way that a ghost can live happily, co-existing with alive people? I suppose they can for a short time. Oh, darling, it's... it's really hard. I know. I know. You think they're real, and you feel that you could go on living like that. I've helped loved ones go into the light, and it's painful, but that's what's best for them. - Okay, I see. - Enjoy this time. Just love them and help them heal their issues. And when the time comes, well, support them with love and courage. Uh, okay. Thank you, Madame Cocolita. You're welcome, darling. Bless you. I'll figure out a way. There she is. - Who? - Violet, my future girlfriend. I thought you said Judy was your one true love. Well, yeah, I was confused. Violet's the one. Oh, well, you got this, man. I mean, you're the coolest dude I know. She'd be lucky to have you. Really? Thanks, man. Good luck. Ew, gay PDA. How's the nose, Geordie? Oh, hey, looks like you dropped your pencil. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah. Hey. The name's Finn. Don't be silly. I know who you are. - Oh, you do? - Of course. We've been going to school together since kindergarten. I remember you used to always chew on crayons and had colored teeth. Oh, right. I haven't done that for quite a while, quit that cold turkey a few weeks ago. - Thanks for the pencil. - Um, no problem. - Catch you around. - Yeah, see you. Hey, how'd it go? Really good. - She laughed, but not at me. - Oh. Yeah. Honestly, I think I have a really good chance. That a boy. - So, skateboarding. - Yes. Ooh! This is awesome. I feel so alive! Whoa, whoa, sorry. Hi. So, um, I was wondering, can I borrow the car tomorrow? Where are you going? Well, I wanted to go for a hike in the state park. - By yourself? - Yeah. I mean, no, no, no, um, with a friend. - Oh, Finn? - Yes. Okay. Well, pack a water bottle, charge your phone, don't get eaten by a mountain lion. Yes! Thank you, Mom. Thank you so much for doing this with me. I'm so excited. There was this photograph of the woods in my hospital room, and whenever there was a stressful day of poking and prodding, I would just look at that picture and think how peaceful it would be to be one of those trees. What kind of tree would you be? Oh, uh, I don't know, probably some old, scraggly tree or something. No, you're an oak. You just don't know it yet. Can we listen to music?

And they get to hang out here. It must be so peaceful. Is that what happens? We eventually become something else? I have no idea, but I hope so. Well, when I die, I want to be one of these trees too. And then we can hang out here together, spying on all the little hikers. Oh. Here, let me help you. Thank you. - Oh, we should get a picture. - Oh, yeah. Whoa, that's weird. I'm a blob. The most lovely blob in existence. Hi, Mom. Hey. You and Finn have fun? Oh, yeah, we had a blast. I ran into Finn and his mom at the grocery store today, so I know he didn't go with you. Oh. Um. You know, that's 'cause he had a bunch of homework, so he just couldn't go. - So you just went alone? - Yeah. Why are you lying, Geordie? You've never been the type of kid who lies. I'm not. I'm not lying. I'm not. You see? That's a lie right there. Finn pulled out last minute, and I just didn't want to worry you 'cause I really wanted to go. Honey, I need you to tell me the truth. Mom, I am, I swear. I was super, super safe. I just didn't want you to get worried, you know? I have a lot of homework, so are we okay? Yeah. Awesome. Love you. - Hey. - Hi. Um, how'd you... how'd you get in here? I rang the doorbell and then snuck in before your mom shut the door. I thought ghosts could just, like, go through walls. Yeah, but that's rude. So what are you doing? Uh, you know, just, uh... Just... just reading a book. Were you crying? No. Pinocchio, your nose is growing. All right, fine, but it's an emotional book, okay? I mean, the dog just died. Don't be embarrassed that you're strong enough to be vulnerable. Which part are you at? - There. - Oh. I guess I've always had trouble with change and death and stuff, you know? Any fours? Go fish. Any sevens? Yes, your sevens. Thank you. My therapist says it's because I moved around so much as a kid and also because, well, my guinea pigs died in a heat wave when I lived in Australia, but no, no, I later found out the gardener ate them. - That's a terrible story. - Yeah. You know, I might have to leave. Oh, yeah, sure, okay. Uh, want to finish the game now? Or we could do it another day. No, like, leave leave. Move on, find the light... ooooh. Oh. Um... do you have to? I don't know. I've never done this before. Oh, well, you know, um... I really don't want you to. I'm just saying I might have to go wherever you go next. I don't know when or how it works or what will happen, but it's just good to be prepared. There's nothing to prepare for. I mean, you don't have to go if you don't want to. I can help you figure out a way. God, that's a terrible story about your guinea pigs. I know. I had to start therapy when my mom brought home my cat. I was just having a hard time letting myself love again. Such a weirdo. It's my birthday tomorrow. Oh, um, happy... happy birthday eve. I would be 16. So I thought maybe if you weren't busy, we could do something after school to celebrate? Yes! I mean, yeah, yeah, sure. Great. Uh, are you okay? Uh, yeah, yeah... just got the chills. Oh, sorry. - Oh, and checkmate. - Wait, what? How... how do you keep beating me? I don't know. Wait, no, no, I moved him here. - No. - This is impossible, no. Wait, go back. I'll show you. Look. Wait, where were you? You should... okay, let's just start over. Hey, look quick but don't be obvious. Where? - At the goddess over there. - That's Nora, right? I thought you liked Violet. Yeah, well, Violet's dating an Italian exchange student. Also, she's Sagittarius, so it wasn't gonna work anyway. I'm over it. I've moved on. Hey! Watch where you're going. Come on, no. It's not worth it. I swear, if he does that to me one more time... Hey, man, can I ask you something? Yeah. - Have you ever dated anyone? - Dabbled, you know? - Okay. - Why you asking? I'm just curious how you know when you're dating someone or if you guys are just friends. You know, I think it's pretty clear. Okay, well, have you ever kissed anyone? Yeah! Well... honestly, dude, no. Neither have I. You know, I think the stigma and the pressure put on guys to date and kiss tons of girls is just unhealthy for society. You're right. Like, when it's the right person and the right time, - it'll be right. - Yes, you're right. Right, so, like, first kiss tomorrow or next month, - it doesn't matter. - Yeah, yeah. You know, even when we're 50, right? Tot... - New kid, move it! - Sorry! It was you? What are you talking about? Um, the... the note that I found in my locker when I started school. Why would I write you a love letter? Are... are you accusing me of being gay? - No. - Do I look gay to you? Don't you dare tell anyone, or I'll kill you.

Yeah, man, that's pretty hard to come back from. What? That's not comforting! Hey, man, you said to be honest. I'm just being honest. You friend-zoned yourself. No, no, no, no, no, no.

Are your eyes still closed? Yes. Geordie, tell me what's going on. Just one minute. Okay. Open your eyes. You said you wanted to travel the world, so I thought I would bring the world to you. Geordie... Here we are in "Paree," France. It's a beautiful place. While there, we ate baguettes and croissants and drank overly hot hot chocolate. Oh, merci, monsieur. After a blissful week in "Paree," you said you wanted to go on a more wild adventure. Mm-hmm. So we took off to Africa. We saw many wildlife. Lions? A whole pride of lions. We narrowly escaped them with our lives. I suggested that we take a calmer trip after that. - Mm. - And then you suggested that we go skydiving in Dubai. Wow.

So, um, do ghosts even, like, need sleep? I don't think I need to, but it's a habit, and I like dreaming. I wonder why out of everyone in the world... I'm the only one that can see you. I don't know. Death's weird. Life's weird. You know, I've never had a ghost sleep in my bed before. Or a girl sleep in my bed before. Oh. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning, poopy. Mom! - Y-y-you should really knock. - Sorry. I didn't realize you wanted privacy. Oh, what... what is all this? It's a... geography assignment. Wow. I love this school. I heard you talking to someone last night. Did Finn sleep over? Nope, just, uh, talking to myself because that's what I do. Okay. Um, here's your laundry. I washed all your underwear. Okay. You can just, uh, set it there. I'll put it... I'll put it away later. I wanted to talk to you about something, but we can chat about it when you come downstairs. - Sure, yeah, I'll... - Love you. - I'll be down in a sec. - All right. Love you... love you too. I'm just saying I forgot she couldn't see you for half a second. I just don't know why you freaked out so much. - Good morning. - Good morning? - I'll see you after school. - Uh-huh. So, um... what's up? Uh, your mom and I just want to have a chat with you. Something wrong? Are we moving again? No, no, no, nothing like that. Um, well, you're... you're growing up into a beautiful young man, and your... your body's changing, and your mind is changing. We're so blessed to be able to watch your transformation. First of all, you've been acting tremendously odd lately, and we just want to let you know that if you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, that's not something that you have to hide from us. Nope, nope, I don't have either, so. We just don't want you to feel like you have to keep any secrets. We want this to be a super open family, so if you have any questions, you can always ask them. I mean, no judgment ever. We just want you to navigate these next new and exciting years of your life healthily and safely. Moms, that's not... Safely being the keyword there because you know how many babies are born every day. Yes, over 350,000, but... And more than 20 sexually transmitted diseases are spread over 13 million people yearly due to improper protection, so what we're saying is, is be respectful of yourself and your partner. Mm-hmm. Thank you, uh, so much for caring. Um, this was a great talk. I love you both, but, um, I gotta go get ready for school. - Okay. - So, um... - We love you, baby. - Uh-huh. - We love you. - Uh-huh, okay. And you're growing up. It's exciting. Yup! What's this? Oh, my God! Did you tell anyone? About what? You know what. The kiss? God, it was... it wasn't a kiss. You don't know anything, Geordie. You don't know what it's like to feel the way that I've felt, to not be able to tell anyone. My friends would hate me. They would, and my parents would beat the crap out of me. That says a lot more about them than it does about you. You just have to survive. In a few years you'll be able to move out, and life's gonna start to get good.

This is the first party we've been invited to. Yeah, well, we weren't exactly invited, but a friend was, who told a friend, who told me, so it's basically the same thing. Yeah, so, uh, what do we have to wear to this party? Is it dressy or casual? - I don't know. - Okay, here's the plan. We're gonna go home, ask our moms what they think we should wear, and we'll regroup in an hour.

I can't believe I'm going to my first high school party. This is your first high school party too, isn't it? - Yeah, yeah, it is. - Who are you talking to? Uh, no one. I mean, ju... I'm just talking to myself. Hey, tell Finn to ditch the tie. Don't you think he looks good? Just trust me. Hey, man, uh, the tie might be a little too much - for this kind of party. - Really? Yeah, I think you were right about the tie. - This is so interesting. - Is it what you expected? Sort of. I mean, I've seen all of Molly Ringwald's films, so I had a general idea.

Not to freak you out or anything, but that was actually my first kiss. - Oh, that wasn't so bad. - Oh, thank you. Well, you know, I've been practicing a lot on pillows lately, so. You know, I used to really worry I was missing out on that whole stereotype teenage experience. I'd get so frustrated I couldn't do things. I'm really glad we came here. It's been fun, but I'm realizing that I wasn't actually missing out on anything. I was just on my own journey. - Yeah. - A good book, a movie, a board game, and if you do all three, well, that's my idea of a wild night. Thank you. - Are you ready to go? - Yeah. I got kissed. Dude, you have to have your first kiss. It's awesome. Parties are awesome. Well, uh, you guys gonna go out on a date? No. She said she doesn't see me that way. She actually said that she sees me more like a brother, which is kinda weird because, well, I doubt she kisses her brother like that. - Sorry, man. - I'm starting to think that I'm not gonna find anyone. Maybe he's just looking for love in the wrong people. Uh, maybe you're just looking for love in the wrong people. Dude, you're so freaking wise. No, I can't take the credit. Someone really awesome told me that. I've always wanted to ride horses. I used to ride my neighbor's pony, Angel. It bit me all the time, bucked me off into a bush, and ran off. Aww. I vowed on that day to never go near another horse. And you broke your vow for me? And look, no one's tried to bite you yet. Huh. Geordie, will you do a favor for me? Yeah, of course, anything. There's something I need you to tell my parents. Oh. Okay, what is it? You'll have to catch me first. Wait up! - How are you? - Uh, I'm good, thanks. Can I get you anything? Are you hungry or thirsty? No, no, I'm perfect, thank you. Uh... so the reason I'm here is, um, because Max wanted me to talk to you guys. What do you mean? I guess I can see ghosts. Not all ghosts, but, um, I... I do see Max. My God. Geordie, you're a great kid, and I know you wouldn't want to hurt us, but this is extremely painful. It is not something to joke about or make light of. No, no, I would never, ever joke about this. How can I prove to them that you're a ghost? Tell them that I heard what they said right after I died. She says she heard what you said after she died. They said they wished none of it had happened and that they'd never been parents. That you wished you had never been parents. Is she here? Right now? Yeah. I always knew she was here. I could feel it. Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. I was... I was angry and sad, and I... I never should have said that. I didn't mean it. Being your mom was the best thing that ever happened to me. Tell them I know, that I'm not mad. She says she understands and she isn't mad. Y-you can see her right now? Yeah. What does she look like? Beautiful. Healthy. She doesn't need her oxygen tank anymore. Will you tell them about the ashes? Oh, um, well, the main reason Max asked me to talk to you is, um... she wants you to do something that's really important to her. Of course, anything. Well, she wants you to follow through with the plan. What plan? When you were planning her funeral. She said she wanted her ashes spread around the world, and you haven't done it. Oh, we meant to. We just haven't done it yet. - Why? - She wants to know why. Because then it means that it all really happened... and that you're really gone. And I've never been as brave as you are. You're the bravest person I've ever known. All the memories will stay. Tell them I want them to do it. I want them to go on all the adventures we always talked about and have fun and think of me in a happy way and just start living again. She says she wants you guys to go through with the plan, go on all the adventures you guys talked about and think of her in a happy way. We will. Yes. We will, baby. - She's hugging you. - I can feel her! Come on, Geordie, get over here. All right. So what crazy adventure you got planned for today? What makes you think I have a crazy adventure planned? Because you always have a crazy adventure planned. I was actually thinking something simpler for today. When I was alive, I wanted to cram in all these crazy things before I died, but I'm realizing what I really miss is just the daily life stuff. Let's be ordinary for today. I am extraordinarily good at that. Come on. Best sunset ever. Yeah, it's pretty spectacular. So what's left on the list? - That's it. - We finished it? Yup. Well, um, we should add more. I mean, I've been thinking about going bungee jumping, and I'm willing to do it. - I think we're good. - Fine, squirrel suit flying. You wore me down. I'm happy sitting right here. Geordie, don't freak out, but there's something I have to tell you. Something's changed. Something feels different. Um, it feels good. I started feeling it a while ago, but now it's just really strong. Um, what do you... what do you mean? I don't think I'm supposed to be here anymore. No. No, no, no, I'm determined to figure out a way. You can live here. You can live like this. I can't live like this. I'm not alive. I'm supposed to change and grow and move on. It's exciting. I'm on, like, a super-cool new adventure. I don't want you to go. Maybe my energy will be recycled, and I'll become a tree or a cat or a snail. I've always wondered what life as a snail would be like. Don't leave me, Max. You are the coolest, most amazing person in the world, and I've been terrified since the moment I met you. I skateboarded 'cause of you, albeit quite badly, but I did it. People think I'm crazy... well, crazier than they already thought, because I talk to myself all the time. I went to a high school party. I stood up to bullies. I got beat up by those bullies. But none of that has scared me as much as this does. So here goes. I love you, Max. I've loved you from the moment I saw you through my bedroom window, and I've fallen more in love with you every single day. And I've just now gotten the courage to say it, so... Yeah. I'm so lucky to have met you, Geordie. I'm lucky to have met you, Max. But I have to leave. I know. - I figured it out. - What? What my last words are gonna be. You know, I've thought about this for so long and fretted over what my words would be and how I'd be remembered. And then I realized... That actions speak louder than words.
