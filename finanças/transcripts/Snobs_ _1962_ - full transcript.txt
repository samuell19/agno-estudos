Here come the bosses! I have loved women a lot. Yes, President. Dozens, maybe hundreds... Yes, President. But most of all, I've loved my umbrella. A bold idea, President! I've always judged by the style and the tie! A man's umbrella classes him more than his tie. Move this vat and we ruin our piping system. That's throwing money away! When it's finished, it'll be striking! God willing, Dufaut! What do you think, Courtin? Put the vats on wheels, and the problem's solved. My God! Stop the pumps! Close the sluice! Too late, he's gone! Unless I'm mistaken, a first-class hat! He'll need a much longer coffin than I thought. He seemed shorter. We've sent for his widow. How terrible! It's impossible! My God! It's impossible! Madame, you find us... absolutely overwhelmed... All of us... together... express our sympathy... in your bereavement. The grief that is upon us... We should like to make the best of this consistency... this circumstance... at this terrible moment... I'm most touched. Thank you! Therefore... according to the regulations... the cooperative members will meet... ten days after... the President's death... in order to elect his successor... who must be... picked from amongst the four co-directors. Namely, Messrs. Dufaut, Lainé... Courtin and Tousseur. A gang of heirs! There is one other problem we must deal with. The acquisition of the milk contract for the schools. It's a very important order involving enormous sums. Naudet was working on it, we must continue. Only a President can negotiate. Let's vote a temporary one. - I refuse. - I refuse. I refuse. Lainé, in 10 days the cooperative members will elect a new President. On what basis? Sex appeal! We've all been here the same number of years. I've admired your ties for 10 years. We've the same positions, the same knowledge of the business and the farmers' confidence. We all have equal chances. A temporary man clinching the deal would use it as electoral bait. We were going to offer you the job, Dufaut. You've a better chance than us. You're the best dressed. Too kind. Friends, I didn't mean to start all this. We're wasting time. Close the meeting! A draw! Let's remain friends. As President, you'd have a better vehicle! No. Pride and conceit sent the angel to hell... It's your fault if we rarely see Morloch. You never invite people. - Hire me a maid - Too expensive! I know what I'll do. You've no guts! I'll put Morloch in my pocket. Wash yourself first! You've no clothes left! We've other worries. If I'm not elected, we'll look silly. Use our relationships. They cost us enough. Use them. Your pyjama's fun! An idea of mine! The last word! Rather striking, isn't he? Try my eggs? If they're yours... What will you do for this election? Coax the school treasurer. Mr. Morloch. Why? He holds a fabulous order. If I could get it, and announce it... Charles, you're the champion of the milk trade! It was the Lord... who made you Morloch's friend. Do you think if you asked him...? The Lord would be upset if I used friendship for profit. If He wants me to be elected, I shall be... We're in His hands. Let us pray... - Our Father... - ...who art in heaven... - Hallowed be... - ...Thy name. - Thy kingdom... - ...come. It's one of two things. Either I sell my hovel... You can sleep at my place. Until you have to sell too! ...or I become President! Get Morloch's order. I'm badly placed for that. You don't know him. And he belongs to the best society in town. Hardly your circle! We're unacquainted! Do they know you play poker? I don't think so. We're discreet. And your girls? Even more discreet! In that case, you've still a chance. Perhaps. I fixed a fine funeral. It was striking! It must have cost a bit! It was so moving. It was fun! It won't be so funny on election day! Lord, I would love to be made President. It's not greed. You've already blessed me with a wife and children. But all the same, I would like to be elected. Where are you off to? Charles! Welcome! Come and see. A real devil! Racing him on Sunday? This nag? Nag! He was wonderful in fifteen of my films! He's a ham who thinks he's a horse! Do you think my horse is a snob? Perhaps he just doesn't like us. All this will have cost me something. Could you introduce me personally to Morloch? Morloch's an odd fellow. I'll introduce you, but I'd watch out if I were you. In a hurry? It's pressing. Deliver St. Joseph's first, then St. Theresa's. She's my little angel, I've put all my hopes in her. Your group's enlarging. They're drivers' girls. You'll make them stars. Our ballet master comes specially from Paris. You spoil them. My life would be empty without them. It's work that brings me here. Do you still supply fuel to the schools? Yes. Our cooperative is going to work with them. We'd like to know what the Treasurer's like. Mr. Morloch! Very efficient. Never late paying the bills. Has he no pet fancy? None. He's a very proper man. He does a lot for young people... scouts...sports clubs... He organized tonight's Gala. Am I disturbing you, Mr. Morloch? Not at all, Mr. Tousseur. I was just dusting the family a bit. A very fine family, Mr. Treasurer. My eldest sister...she's a nun. My youngest brother, a distinguished officer... Decorated eight times... Four wounds, one of them serious... He's even disabled. Rheumatism's no better, eh? Doctors cost money... Our late President suffered from it. Dear old Naudet. We had our little secrets, you know. Secrets between friends. Yes, I know. That's why I'm here. You know! You've come for? That's it. How much did he offer you? That depends. Was it a lot? Not a lot. But you are talking of... ...the milk order... I'm prepared to beat Naudet's offer. But tell me... If one of my colleagues bids higher, tell me... Just name your figure... There's some mistake! Naudet would never have bribed me. He was honest. Get out! A magnificent beast, I killed him. There he is. Isn't he in the army yet? He has his papers. I want to join the paratroops. You're just the type. Got any mincemeat? Not yet! It's a great night tonight. I'd like to go, but I've no seat. I'll fix you a good seat. I'll cheer for you. I'll put up a good fight. Are the photos OK? Fine, boss! Snobs! Ready for blows? How much, if I lose? Got the jitters? All right, I'll 'fry' you then. Yvon Joël, you're an explorer, I'm an actor... Like others are doctors. It's a social status. Did you really feel you were living a great adventure, at the pole? We had radio and heating. We were snug. The Echo must not publish such shameful items. He has a better seat. As shareholder and director, I hold you two responsible. But stories about sex maniacs cutting women up... sell copies. We share the work, Father. You offer your clients God. We offer ours the Devil. Impressive! Their uppercuts are laboured. They have lovely biceps. I love the blue of his shorts. A fine way to beat the Devil! Leave it to me. Striking, wasn't it? Very grand! A game of bridge, later? Gladly, at whose place? Charles Dufaut's... I'm on bad terms with the cooperative directors. They're too enterprising. Too bad! Yvon Joël is with the boxers! When I was in the icy wastes... How did you manage without women? When I was in the icy wastes... Yvon Joël, please come to my fête. It's a Scouting event! Our boys would love to meet an explorer. Come for the children's sake. Kids bore me stiff! He prefers girls! My stomach! If it hurts, go and empty it! You want that monkey at our fête? A few coarse words won't upset our boys. A hunter's tough physique... goes with rough language. His refusal is most unfortunate. Good evening, Treasurer. Good evening, Director. Morloch seems very disappointed. Very... very... very... Excuse me, Madame. How are you? Very well, Mr. Courtin. The last word! I feel I'm going down to my grave! A smart grave classes a man! It's through with Morloch. He's on his guard. Against all of us. All four of you, without exception. Bring the lobster. What about tomorrow? An omelette, then. Give us a drink. It's a strong one! With a kick! And for the ladies? Some white wine! Muscadet. Two Muscadets. What about some publicity? An election campaign... You're absolutely right! Your cousin would help. The General? He's efficient. Extremely... and highly respected around here. I'll back you. The favourite! Play ''The Negro's Burial''. From New Orleans! With a swing! How striking! With Kid Ory on trombone. Some more muscadet for me! Some eggs? If they're yours...boiled! It's only me...I love you. You're mad coming here. I've got to see you. Softly...mother has clients. Broke again? That's not the point. Get down here! This seducing of youngsters can't go on! Why were you nasty to Yvon JoëI Stoff? You've come to find out? Stoff can be of use to me. You're fooling people? Who? The local snobs... Who is Stoff? He was girl crazy before going to the Pole. He looks beefy, but it doesn't tally. Is he clumsy? Worse! Ill-equipped! That hefty chap! It's the smallest thing you ever saw! Going to bed? Yes. Goodnight. Sleep well. Be kinder to your mother. She's sweet. Why? Do you like her? No! You're the apple of my eye! I noticed you, yesterday. I felt for you. Those sarcastic girls! Don't worry. Guys like me are used to being alone. We need no one! Because you're strong. I envy you. Don't mention it. Women have laughed at me too! Poor fellow...you too? I used to go from girl to girl. They adored me. Until one day I learnt that they chatter to each other. They compare...and measure! It's awful! I've been disillusioned. I thought love was clean, pure and spiritual. Shared intimacy... Beds are public places. If nature's failed you... - Down below... - Girls sneer at it. Is that why you dropped everything? You went to the icy wastes to forget. Not me. I faced up to it. I sought elsewhere. Did it work? I help the young. Good for you! Help me succeed. I'm working at the fête. I won't go. Listen, we're brothers. Don't let me down, just because of those women. Together, we'll be strong. The boys will be so glad to meet you. All right, I'll look in. A dilapidated cattle market. Get it done up and open it! A coat of red lead's enough. What you must do... is to go to the farmers. They're your audience. Show yourself. Show I'm at work! I'm great friends with fat old Badjou. He has a share in The Echo. We'll get the press. Follow my advice and you'll win. I know this game. Your approach seems odd. These are purely civil duties. But I'm a retired General. That's no criterion. The smart end to an army career is to die in bed. You always want attention. Death in battle is undistinguished. Unless you're a civilian. The criterion for an army man is to be a fine civilian and for a civilian, to be a fine soldier! One must be what one is not, and not be what one is. I feel elected already! Come and get it! My little lamb! Do you like Couscous? Mmm...with chick peas! Here is your new market place for you, the farmers and breeders... a place of honour, a place of work and pride! The election's on its way, eh? Very soon now! You therefore have your new Market Place. You're happy! The difficulties I encountered to obtain from the authorities these wonderful installations were numerous. You've won them over! Many of you... are members of our cooperative and know I understand their problems and solve them! The election's in eight days. What in God's name should I do? Tell me! After all, I wash my hands of it! Give me a drink. Wash yourself first. I await election day with confidence. Holy Mary, pray for me. St. Michael, pray for me. St. Joseph, pray for me. An adorable Chinese vase! It's priceless! I think Badjou got it at Woolworth's. Tell the old devil it was a stuffy joke! Can you say that? Stuffy...stuffed! What rascals we are! Not in front of the children! Come with us. We're overworked! Let's run. I bet you can't catch us. Is the sale in the stables? They're disused. I didn't want a crowd in the house. The ground must do. How lavish! I'm Fernand. I've got good news for you. How sweet! And this one? If I remember rightly... Mr. Morloch wanted Yvon Joël to come. I've persuaded him to come. He's a fantastic person. He dreads women. Remember the Gala? He swears and spits. Is he a muscle man? Depends on what muscles you mean. How do you know such things? Tell! You devil! We've got Stoff! I'm Fernand. Poor darling... A mad drunkard's son. I adopted him out of pity. He does little things for me! Charming little man. I'm delighted you're here. I'd like to do something for the fête too. Just a little job. Yvon JoëI will come more willingly... if I'm there to protect him. We'll ask our wonderful organiser. Mr. Wonderful Organiser! Don't get excited, Mr. Lainé. You're the organiser! What are you doing here? Taking a look. Interested in Scouting suddenly? I'm getting Mr. Courtin to help. Can Mr. Courtin replace you? No change! He can't. Too bad! Everything's done. I see. Help us another time. I'm Fernand. He's a real devil! I'm Fernand. Charming little man! Everything fixed? She wants me to work at the fête. Really? But the others don't. They're sincere. Lainé. He's no snob! Get round him. Leave it to me. Get down. Here comes my dupe! For what we are about to receive... may the Lord make us truly thankful. Still a hungry family! Fine food has produced a fine family. - Right, Mama? - That's right, Papa. You upset me just now... That's the last thing I wanted to do. I'd love to help at the fête. You surprised me so... You've never done a thing for Scouting. Look at my life! You live amongst kindness... Stinker! Bastard! God has blessed me. Not me. I'm all alone... My life's useless. It's beginning to weigh heavy. I would so like to help you. I want to contribute... to your worthy efforts. The Chief Scout will give you his job at the fête. It's easy... You don't have to be clever. I do so want to become... a new man. I'll help and encourage you. I need it... You know so many people... they can help me change. You'll meet some at the fête. The Bishop for example... He'll understand you. Mr. Morloch too... I do so need their help. Charming little man. He wasn't very grounded. Hurry! The guests are coming! You'll get a good tip. Come and see the Igloo! Come and see the Igloo! We begin in five minutes. What's happening? In five minutes! I'm Fernand. Morloch's coming. The Bishop's coming. Don't catch cold. The Holy Spirit has no right to catch a flu! Welcome. Mr. Courtin. He's new here! Good for you! Look who he's got for us! It's our snowman, Yvon JoëI! I knew how much Mme. De St. Aigne wanted to have our explorer. You seem to be doing something here too. I keep things running smoothly. We don't often see you. I saw that Lainé was so overworked. Good for you! These youngsters are something new to me. You'll see. Youth's a fascinating thing. I feel awkward amongst all these kids. Don't worry. Lainé and I will look after you. If you want to stay with us... That's all I ask. Some lemonade, Bishop? Ladies and Gentlemen... The St. Honoré troop presents... a little show organised by... the scouts of the Fox Patrol. 'The Song of the Woodcutter.' Cut, cut, cut the wood A healthy pastime! Not enough youngsters join our movement. Start a press campaign. Our Parish magazine has a poor circulation. And The Echo? The Echo doesn't share our Christian views. But it has a wide circulation. If articles appeared in it... drawing parents' attention to our activities... We've thought of it... But no one would read them. I'm well known around here. Mr. Courtin looks after our cooperative members... He visits the farms. If I wrote articles, interest would be aroused. And how! Is Mr. Courtin qualified to write on such a subject? He could submit the articles to you. The Bishop would have to write a preface. Not so fast. Let's try it. I'll get straight to work. It was Mr. Dufaut... who got you this training ground. Youth has not been forgotten by its elders. Take aim! Take aim! Take aim! The bunglers! Bring me a bow! Bring me a bow! We're always criticised for being one war behind. We're always criticised for being one war behind. I say, we're two in advance. I say, we're two in advance. When the bomb has destroyed everything... When the bomb has destroyed everything... We'll go back to the axe! We'll go back to the axe! So, train sensibly! So, train sensibly! This is no time to play dead! This is no time to play dead! Together...like the Huns! Together...like the Huns! Charge! Charge! The kids love it... You'll get their Dads' vote! You'll get their Dads'vote! You've won them over! Get Dufaut alone. Here. From all angles. Oh Lord... I confidently await election day... St. Victoria, pray for me... St. Joan of Arc, pray for me... Only five days left. What do you want me to do? I wash my hands of it. Give me a drink. Wash yourself first! Relax! Clubs! I'm off. The articles! You didn't botch them? Let me know. The Bishop's got to write a preface. Go and sell the rubbish! Who's speaking? What about? I'll go and see. These articles are young in spirit. I feel at home with young people. It's odd. There's something... rather feminine about them. I don't have to lie... I'm equally at home with women. With Bishops too, it would seem. You have charm, Mr. Courtin. I think you can help us a lot. But as for the preface you want... Mr. Morloch insists. The text lacks religious inspiration. You're a non-believer, I take it. My relations with the Church are somewhat vague. What! 50% for this wretched orchestra! I get the Palladium stars at 80% . Listen. The Church must benefit, not the organisers! Get me 80% , or I'll fix it myself. God's Church is poor enough! The things one does to get a few pence for God! Why don't you organize this Gala yourself? The Bishop is skilled in such matters. I must admit, I outsmart the most famous impresarios. You've got business sense! The Devil pays cash. To defend God, I must go one better. And enlist the aid of my kind. Sometimes one needs the Devil's help! Why refuse me my preface then? You're a shrewd one! I'm convinced you can help us. I'll do you a little piece. Call him back. We'll settle for...60% . You'd do better with the nudists than with Boy Scouts. Don't be vulgar. I'm undergoing a moral crisis. You'd be better off with the nudists. Will you publish my articles? Leave them at the office. Just look at my face! I see nothing. Exactly. It's getting worse. It came out this morning... It's not disastrous! If I lose my hair, my wife will leave me. She loved running her hand through it. Would it be better this way, or that way, or with a curl? Or brushed straight back? You should try a lotion. That's what I think of lotions! Laughing at me? Get the hell out of here! You can stuff your articles! Throw them in the dustbin! Calm down...don't be an old snob! Snob? I don't play at being a journalist! Snob, yourself! Me? Yes, you! He called me a snob! You deserved it, you silly ape! An ape's more intelligent than a snob. An ape can play the snob. But a snob can't ape about. It's a lie! Snobs ape snobs! In that case... I'll get round Badjou. He's a big shareholder in The Echo. Who cares? Don't you? Not at all. I'm fed up with your tricks. Blaming me? Hoax the peasant, if you like. I'm not interested. President or not, you're the same to me. What do you mean? I'm just here to listen and make love when you want. Then, you run off. What else can we do? We can't be seen. That's your idea. A secret affair's a pretext for running off when it's over. Even so, we can't make love all day. If that's all you want, find yourself a tart! That's all you want from me! I love you, Sarah. If you did, you wouldn't hide me. How? You'd marry me. Marry you? Instead of gambling... you'd build a home for your wife... And I'd give you kids. Of course! I want some. All right, I'll give you one. You devil! Don't get upset. Wait until I'm President. Then we'll see. I believe you. You liar, I adore you! Give me a baby, darling! Two, if you like! Don't make babies in a draught, they'll be weak! You'll stun Paris. Paris won't understand us. Snobs applaud without understanding. I scorn applause... What I want... is to prevent the depravation of these children. I do similar work, too. You? Yes, me. I need your help... to get my articles into The Echo. I never interfere. Look up Archambault, the editor. Marie-Rose, it's your turn. Where are you, my little one? Roll up! There's liquor and girls! We have witnessed a brilliant exercise by our young folk. It's true to say that culture and physical culture... blend together. A big hand for our country girls! Just a little swig. If you promise to wash well. L promise. Mr. Dufaut will show you he doesn't only talk... but he acts! What a fine example he sets to the young. Muscles of steel! Morloch wants to see me. I can't get the articles published. What will Morloch think? He'll think I'm just a sham! He won't give you the order... I've not finished yet. They're already written... And prefaced, they've only to appear. Don't you find that Courtin's sudden interest... in our young people is rather odd? Nostalgia for his childhood. Nostalgia for my contract, more likely! Possibly. Anyway, he's useful to us. We must encourage him. We'll encourage him. Good night, Bishop. What'll you tell Morloch? I'll bluff. I can't fail to turn up. See you tonight at the windmill. These articles? It's taken care of. The Echo accepted? Without difficulty. I'm an old friend of Archambault's. And Badjou too... You have useful friends. I have friends at The Echo too. Above The Echo, rather! Higher up! Very! Much higher! The director of the Lambotte papermill. They control The Echo with Badjou. If you'd had any difficulties... What do you mean? This friend I spoke of, Chauvin. Don't be frightened... He could have asked Lambotte to ask... Archambault... You have useful friends... But as your articles... are coming out, there's no need. Tell me... Does this Mr. Chauvin live near here? He works at the mills in Le Havre. I'll remember that, for another time... See you again. You've soap in your ear. It's nothing, just some flour. The Lambotte Mills? The Lambotte Mills... I'm sorry, but Morloch told me he knew you well. People pretend to have important connections... in order to look big themselves. It's snobbish. I think your Morloch must be a real snob! A real bluffer! So you don't think Lambotte can get my articles published? If we had to bother about charity... My liver trouble costs me a lot, but I pay for it myself. Liver trouble? Yes! You too? Nothing much, just the bladder... Not me! The leading Paris doctors found a fascinating cyst. You're a case! The top medical boys are interested in me! You're remarkable. I think so. I'm glad I met you, even if I can't do anything. I would so like to help you... Introduce me to Mr. Lambotte... He's not here at the moment. You might catch him at the port. How do you know? He said so yesterday. You misunderstood. He seems to hear well enough. I can hear a pin drop. Snob quality...very velvety! Go down to the port. Let's go. Finished playing the fool? Come with me. He never lets up! Not a bad car, but after 3 months I'm fed up with it. I never change mine. Here's the pirate! How nice of you to come down. The least I could do. Mr. Lambotte, meet Mr. Courtin. He's from The Echo. It's about some articles... Those snobs are a lot of morons! Nice hats! They clutter up the boat. They come so I can swear at them! Invited to be insulted! To be sworn at, and thrown to the crabs! I love crab salad. The North sea crabs get well nourished. Do you sail the North sea? The Mediterranean's dreadful. You run into everyone. Carry torpedoes? Waste of gunpowder. They're all rich snobs. My boat has the modesty of a real sailor. You're a purist! Mr. Courtin wants you to help him... I'll throw the girls to the octopi. They'll love it! The girls or the octopi? Both! Let's have a drink, and you can tell me what you want. You'll be late. I may not even go. Those snobs might disgust the sharks. Hi! Louse! Hello! Imbecile! My brother. He hates cars, and rides a bicycle. Fine sailor! He was born on the crest of a wave! Come to the café with us, or I'll leave you here! Wine! I haven't a penny. Chauvin, you pay! The Echo. Mr. Archambault, please... Publish Courtin's articles at once. Very well. Courtin's cunning! We Like Them Chaste and Pure What made him write such stuff? That's easy to understand... What? Tell me. You don't understand any more than I do. I understand he's fooling you... that the farmers... ...like their children to be looked after. He's earnest... ...and would make a fine President... ...and it would be wise to vote for him. That's how Courtin's winning over the farmers. We must stop the articles! Courtin's such a devil! It's very difficult to beat civilians on their own ground. Propaganda's all right, but fulfilment is better. What about money? The Co-op is rich! Can we expect a few subsidies? We could help you... build a little stadium... start a few clubs... Is it really feasible? That depends on our new President. Lainé has a good chance. If that were true... He enjoys a fine reputation. Lainé would be a President devoted to our cause. Naturally... our subsidies would depend upon our turnover. Let's hope it increases. That's up to you. - I can see what you're getting at. - You've guessed. You're shrewd. You're even shrewder. You want the order for you cooperative. We'd all benefit... our subscribers... and the children. If Lainé wasn't elected...? I might be. If not? You alone can ensure Lainé's success... or mine. How? By giving one of us... your order. When's the election? In four days. We have time to think it over. Please... After you... Afraid? - No. Why? - What's on your mind? Nothing at all. - Let's wait for the others. - Where can they be? - This is my office! - We're doing your work. We don't see much of you... He was ironing his ties! You don't incite people to work much! I've not your gift for public speaking. I've not your gift for writing. - The customers want an answer. - We'll sort it out. You're plotting against me... ...to stop me from winning. A President who never worked would be useless. Wait until I've won. And I'll kick you all out! Wait until Saturday! He's cocksure! - He has the General behind him. - We must stop him! Oh Lord! Protect us! What can we do? Kill him! God can hear you! We can't murder him. I don't mean stabbing or shooting. You don't get rid of people that way... if you are... well brought up. Is the General in? No. His wife's in the sheepcote. Come my little one! My respects, Madame. The General adores lambs... dead or alive! Is he out for long? No, I'm getting him some roast mutton for tonight. He's with his troop on the banks of the Orne. That's miles away. But what if Dufaut's elected...? What's to be done? Smear Dufaut's reputation with the General. But what do I do? Nothing. See you tomorrow. Why are you going to the General? To tell him that Dufaut's dishonest! But that's slander! Dufaut threatens to sack you... If you're kicked out, how will your kids eat? How terrible! I'll come with you tomorrow. Dufaut's ruining your reputation. He's using you to threaten us... A dictator's trick! God gave me 11 children. If Dufaut fires me, they'll go hungry! - I'll pull out. - We knew we could count on you. But you're hell bent on winning too, Courtin. Your articles are perfect! I serve the cause of youth, like you. We work with the Bishop and Morloch. What? With Mr. Morloch? - It's absolutely normal. - We're devoted to his cause. What a dreadful mistake I've made. Dufaut wants to stop your articles. He's a danger to the community. - He'll use Libou. - What intrigue! Things are bad! Carry on! Don't go into my tent. It's untidy! Carry on: What you waiting for? Get moving! It all seems very odd to me... The eggs are ready. They're fresh. - What is it? - It's the General. No! Why? Courtin told him lies about me. The crafty devil! He'll pay for it. I'll stop the articles... whatever the cost. How? Thanks to our friend Libou. He's my only hope. He's already helped. He got you the space in The Echo. He'll get the articles stopped. - We must tell him at once. - He's not in town. - But Libou's at the hunt. - Where? Here and there. Let's start looking for him! We must find him. My lovely hearse! Where are you going? Morloch! With his bag! I don't care about that Morloch! - You don't... - I'm the strongest! You're the strongest! - Stop! - Stop the articles! Oh, my lovely car! I can't stand it any more! Dufaut wants to stop my articles. How could he? The Echo is owned by two people... Lambotte, who helps me, and Badjou... The fat man who makes the little girls dance? This fat pig is Libou's pal. Labou of the film sector? And Libou's a friend of Dufaut's. - Nice group! - Yeah! Dufaut's damned artful! - And the two others? - Tousseur and Lainé? They're just clots! They look plump! My wife does them with cheese. We have soup. I must get some cabbage. What are these articles for? Our friend Courtin is a Ionely bachelor. So he's looking after the young. With Morloch? Lsn't that odd? No. It's admirable. If I were Morloch, I'd watch out. Now, you can give me a glass. I know what's to be done. - You've done it? - I'll fix them... so that Courtin's against Dufaut, Lainé's against Courtin and I'm against Lainé. How? - I'm not quite sure yet... - Wash yourself first! We're lucky to have rooster's blood to cook with. We always eat well. That's why we've got such healthy children. L wish you wouldn't frequent Courtin so much. - He looks like the devil! - He's charming. So is the Devil! You scare me. - Tousseur suspects him too. - You see what I mean. I've no confidence in the articles. Tousseur thinks I should see Morloch. Warn Morloch. Courtin is plotting something! I've heard serious things about you. It can't be! - Lainé's just left me. - How is he? Your sudden enthusiasm for the Boy Scouts... was to win me over. That's true. You admit it! I wanted to please... - But why? - To get your order. You cunning schemer! It was true. 'Was'? Mr. Morloch... I've changed a lot. You're trying to trick me again. No. I've discovered a new world... of kindness. Lainé... Pure devotion... You. Innocence... The children... Words, words, words! I don't want to be President. Give your order at once to Lainé. I won't forget! He's sure to be elected, then. And I'll stay by your side. I've found a new family... Which I won't leave, unless you kick me out. Come now... Listen to me, Courtin... Slander me... I shall forgive... I can prove it to you. And it'll be done today. They want to stop my articles. Lainé told me. It's Dufaut, isn't it? I'll do my utmost to get them published. Listen Courtin... I'm overwhelmed. Whatever happens, I'll do all I can to help you. I'm overwhelmed! It's overwhelming. Libou's disappeared. We've searched all night. I can't stop the publication of Courtin's articles. Libou asked you to help me. Libou doesn't run the paper. - Badjou does! - Libou is Badjou's friend... and you're Libou's friend. But there's Lambotte as well... So what? Lambotte's a friend of Courtin's. And I'm a friend of Libou's, consequently Badjou's too. My dear friend, l can't refuse Badjou, without Lambotte's consent... I can't refuse Lambotte without Badjou's consent. I was sure my egg shampoo would do you good. We've got to find Libou. Libou's at the hunt, where the Doctor was killed. We were looking for him. I'll photograph the body. - I envy you. - We've no car! - Take mine. - Seen Marie Rose? No, I haven't. Let me know if you do. Let's go and see Badjou. No, let's bring Libou back here. Thanks again. - We've been looking for you! - Things bad? Courtin's tricked me. A press campaign in The Echo. - The Echo! - You must persuade Badjou! - Let's go. - We're on foot. The cars? I'll fix it. I'm a friend of Mr. Lambotte. - In conference? - He's in Southampton. Southampton? Where is Marie-Rose? Where is Southampton? Where can she be? Where can it be? Mr Courtin, if you should see her... Badjou's looking for Marie-Rose. Has she disappeared? If he knew she was with one of his drivers... he'd kick her out. He'd have to replace her. Who could replace her? A little blonde girl I know... And if she agreed to it... My articles would continue to appear. Get it? Got it. But I can't dance... Couldn't you learn for a few days? You are really something! Careful, here's the van! - Monsieur Courtin? - What's that outfit? - Comfort! - For driving? A young girl... What have you done? She could get pregnant! I'm just a guy. You should live up to your uniform. I look after kids too. You must marry her. Or I'll tell Morloch and Badjou, the Bishop, the Scouts. And your parents, Marie-Rose! The Police and children's court! You'll tell Badjou about your marriage tonight! But if I do... he'll fire me! He'll kick me out of the company! He'll never approve! Prefer going to court? No, Mr. Courtin. We'll get married. Kiss me. Kiss me again. I've told Badjou. - Did he congratulate you? - He kicked us out. You can be a Co-op chauffeur. Why did you deceive me, Marie-Rose? Her baser instincts took hold. I thought I'd made an angel of her... with no stomach, and sexless. She became a woman again. She danced divinely. I know a little creature... You couldn't know another Marie-Rose! A young girl, not attracted to men... I give up. I'll send all the girls away. An ethereal little thing... Lithely... Like a tigress. With celestial eyes! Bring her to me. Bring her to me. Nothing would please me more. But I'm too worried at the moment. My articles have been stopped. Are there more? Of course, it's a campaign for youth! Mr. Morloch must be upset. - You understand? - Perfectly! I'll do what I can at the paper. But don't forget me young girl... and don't bring just anything. Otherwise... Come on, move! Quicker! But you promised to support Dufaut... He had some nice pictures on the front page. But The Echo can't publish the opponent's articles! Stop their publication. Courtin's cheating the farmers. He's not writing for them. It's to please Mr. Morloch! He's well in with Morloch. The order! Only two days to go! What's to be done? St. Theresa, pray for me... St. Anthony, pray for me... St. Lucien, pray for me... Why not Courtin? We're not sure of him. He's efficient. Let's wait and see if his articles continue. If he brings it off, shall I give him the order? Courtin as President... I'd be happier with Lainé. Lainé's less enterprising, but more trustworthy... We must decide! Courtin or Lainé? Nothing proves Courtin has the order. Expect the worst! Implicate Courtin in some scandal... Too late! What can you accuse him of? Hasn't he any girls, or vices? He must have, but there's no proof. His life's a secret. That's why he's trusted. If we can't implicate Courtin, what about Morloch? No Morloch, no order. No order, no Courtin! Do you remember? The bag! Morloch and his bag! Morloch has the right to go walking... At night...by the sea... and in deserted streets. But why that bag? That enormous bag... What could be inside it? The articles will go on. Wonderful! I was sure you'd do it. The Bishop and I would be very pleased if you were elected. Tell the cooperative members you have the order. Exactly. Goodbye. - He's got his bag. - It's getting late. That's no proof. You pee too, don't you? Not with a bag! Call the Police. Not just because he's peeing with a bag! Let's get the Police! Call the firemen! It's all wrapped up! After the election I'm telling Badjou my leg's broken. I'm very grateful to you. Some thanks! A President doesn't waste words. An excuse not to see me? Presidents have to work hard! And there's your reputation! A President's every move is watched. Is there a fire? It's worse! Chief! Can you see? Not very well yet! It looks like he's at it. He's wagging his tail! Yes, sir, wagging! This time, there's no doubt about it. It's a scandal! In a public building! Shit! A man responsible for sailors' safety! He's coming down! He's coming out! Turn on the lights! The Saints protect me! There's been a mistake! I'll complain to the council... to the General... I'll complain to the Bishop. Gone with the wind! To Morloch! To Courtin! It's incredible! I've had this rheumatism since the war! It exhausts me. I believe you. I'm ashamed I suspected you. You'll see in view of my exhaustion, why I conceal my healing powers. Well now... You must be very discreet about this. The election's today. What can I do? Wash yourself! My future's in your hands, Jesus. I know I can trust you. Quick! Perfect! - He's ready for me! - Poor René! L was ready! Your directors have gone through a lot... First Naudet... now Lainé. Before anything else... let us observe a minute's silence in their memory. The departed left us in righteousness and honesty. Unfortunately, some of those who remain... risk being affected... by the dreadful scandal... we witnessed last night. Shame! ''Evil be to him who evil thinks''. L accuse you of slander, Dufaut! You! If your Cooperative soon gets an order... to supply all the schools in the county... an order worth more than a million pounds... you owe it to Mr. Courtin! How did he do it? They're fresh. What's happening to Courtin? Let's not talk about it. Yes... l want to know. He's starting... to share the honours. Good morning, President! Hello, Treasurer Greetings! Greetings! Mr. President... Mr. Treasurer... Dirty snob! The Bishop and I... Iook forward to meeting to discuss your subsidies... with the local dignitaries. Interesting! The Mother Superior of St. Theresa's. Excellent! D. Lespinasse, the choir master. Fine! ...and the vicars and parsons. Most inspiring! Taking Mr. Lainé's place upsets me... He's in Paradise now. 1, 2, 3... In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Brethren... l know you are eager to hunt the deer... so my sermon will be brief. The word of God... must not be sullied. May you find in the massacre... of the beasts of the field... a symbol... of the sin that burdens us all... and in the eyes of the dying hind... that you destroy... behold the visage... of fallen man. Look to the almighty... and thank him for the safe field... of slaughter... that he offers your knives. But... Subtitles: Antony Balch Subtitling TITRA FILM Paris
