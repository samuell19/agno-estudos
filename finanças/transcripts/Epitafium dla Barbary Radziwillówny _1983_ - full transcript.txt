Fresh cypress gives the best ash. But juniper is no worse. The King! Where is my King? I miss the King! I miss the King! If only the King was sitting next to me... I wouldn’t rot so alone! Come here, one of you! You, loner, come over. You wear black like the king. But you are not a king, but Anonymous. Come, you’ll play the king. Give me a touching ode for my death. If our holy Lady wouldn’t be so bigoted, she would have died even more holy if she hadn't rotted. You can mock me... Get out! - How do you dare? - Leave him. - I ordered him. - She’s still alive! I also ordered monks to gather ashes. There won’t be enough time later on. DEATH MUST NOT BE SUMMONED Death has come already. JANUSZ MAJEWSKI’s FILM EPITAPH FOR BARBARA RADZIWILL Keep silent until dawn! A coat for the king! Gracious Lord, Your Highness. It is no harm. This is our duty that fate destined for us. It’s not the time to discuss it yet. When is the time for it then? We must enjoy every moment. Yes. When I could, I lived well. Then, in the monastery the nuns healed my body, my broken bone. And a holy old hermit healed my soul. The world lives not in sadness but in joy. In holy existence. Can you hear the throbbing? The huge heart of this existence. Can you feel that every moment is pure joy? You don’t have to count moments. They all become one. They all become one. They are misjudging us. We should not be treated as celebrities. I took her where she wanted, that's all. Tell them to greet us with simplicity from now on. I will, Sire. You have not disappointed our trust, Your Majesty. You came to us. That’s customary. The widowed husband must not be missed at the wake of his deceased wife. God bless you for your hospitality; we will return to the monks. Let the court feast, as usual. The court will return to Krakow in the morning. Harsh words, Your Majesty. - Why do you refuse? - Because I want to. I order it. I have spoken. - We are hungry, Ostoja. - Quite so, Sire. Will you give us something to eat? Some of your bread, sprinkled with ashes? We are not fasting today. Today we have ribs in cabbage. Still hot. Dish it out. What are you waiting for? They call you “Anonymous”. Is it a mockery? Why are you accompanying us? You don’t have to. You are wrong, Sire. I have to. Whoever wanted could go. You put rhymes together. They say also for mockery. I do it according to my ability. - Do some on the spot! - I don’t do it on the spot. But I have something. At an early morning hour just before the dawn sets in lazy sleep enfolds me with its blackish wing. Feeding on my human grief it expands its darkness swiftly changing my body into a numb carcass. You say “grief”. Pity, that the night is late. I'd engage in a dispute with you. There are many nights ahead of us. Barbara... Barbara! You are deluding yourself, Sire. This is not Barbara. She’s no longer here. Elisabeth? Is that you? Yes, Sire. That’s Elisabeth, your first wife. But... she is... no longer here either. She came back, Sire. She wants to give you her thanks. Thanks... Elisabeth...! Please... Elisabeth! Elisabeth! It’s nothing, Sire. It’s nothing. Sleep quietly. Sleep... Sleep quietly! You’re tired, Sire. Time to rest. Come closer! Faster! Come closer! Don’t sleep! - How was the king’s night? - Why are you asking? Was he bothered by bad dreams? Looks like there were none. I know because I kept watch. “Sleep enfolded him with its blackish wing”. You prophesied well, Anonymous! You are very pale. Aber nein! Nein! I anoint you Queen with this holy oil in the name of the Father and the Son and the holy Spirit. Peace be with you and with your spirit. Receive the crown of glory and happiness, so that you deserve perpetual joy in heaven, Amen. Why? Why? Santa Madonna! Elisabeth! - Mein Gott! - Call a medic, immediately! No! Only God can help. Not a doctor. No doctor? How’s that? She has to rest. Leave us, Sire. Why should I leave? She’s too young. My God! Too young! Wouldn't you rest a little, Sire? It's a long way to go. Leave it. That’s how it must be. If you could, my gracious Lady, spare me a few minutes. Fine. Come to see me. - In the evening? - No. Later. Before midnight. I can't, I can't overcome my disgust! Then... go to Lithuania. No. The Grand Duke won’t go to Lithuania covertly. The Grand Duchy needs the Master's eye. You will go in great splendour, surrounded by the court. And the money? So far, Vienna has not paid a penny from the dowry. It didn’t and it won’t pay soon. But my coffers are always open to Augustus. Will Elisabeth stay here? Of course. She needs good care all the time. The King has taken a liking to her. She is so niece and kind. We will take care of her. I only have to know one thing. Are you sure you are not leaving your wife in the family way? She, with a child? Mother! When can I go? Even next week. On the first of August. - On my birthday. - That may be a good sign. Go to Lithuania, August. When I saw you on the threshold of this house, I immediately thought... That's why I came to Lithuania; to meet the mistress of this castle Barbara of the Radziwills. Former mistress. Today Gieranony belongs to the Queen. And only the fear of the plague stopped me from leaving. - Because it is safer here. - Not for me. Why so, Sire? Don’t you know? I would like to deny it. But I cannot. I know. You are beautiful in black, - but these are widow's garments. - Yes? You promised to take them off. You promised. Yesterday. And tonight, I will keep my promise. Radziwill the Ginger won’t give in to Radziwill the Black in anything. He crushes goblets because I bend horseshoes. I see that the local impenetrable forests hide many surprises. Not so impenetrable! Our Lady, Queen Bona, has either travelled their length and breadth herself, or with the legs of her faithful servants. The walls of this castle have ears. So, I prefer to speak with you here. Just, please, understand me well. I'm afraid. This beginning bodes evil. This evil is apparent. I won the battle. At the end of October, I will sit on the Vilnius throne, - as Grand Duke. - Oh, Sire! But there is one condition set by the king. I am to live in the lower castle not alone, but with a wife. What, with Elisabeth? Remember, she's the Emperor's niece. My mother's Italian succession is in the hands of the Habsburgs. I can't openly abandon Elizabeth. The Ginger warned me. "You'll be just a toy in royal hands, nothing else, but a toy”. The Black is wiser. He knows what necessity is. He advises to agree to all conditions in order to gain full power. - Does it mean that I... - It doesn’t mean anything. I will bring Elizabeth here if that is the will of my father. And I will see you in Vilnius, whenever you will let me. My permission is as pathetic as I am, myself. I swear to you. I have nobody in this world whom I would love more. Believe me, it’s you! Only you, forever. Didn’t he come back? Nein. Noch nicht. Speak Polish. I thought that here in Vilnius, far from the Queen's evil eyes, it would be different. But I'm still only waiting, counting days... and I remain alone. Shall I write to Vienna? Or perhaps ask his sister Izabela for intercession and help? No. No complaints. No letters. Is it far, this Rudniki Forest... in which he hunts? It’s far. You must be patient, my gracious Lady. But I am... patient. I am. We are so rarely together nowadays. Far too rarely since the Queen has come to Vilnius. Don’t talk about Vilnius and about the court. Here, in the forest, there are only the two of us. I will stay in Rudniki, as long as you like. That means for very long. For the entire winter. For many, many winter days... and nights. You... here? I came to bid you farewell before my departure for the Wawel. So, it’s true what Kathrine said. My father envoys finally brought the dowry. Only a part, in silver and gold. Couldn’t I come with you? I’ve asked the medics. They say that every emotion, even the smallest one, can harm you. They advise against traveling. Stay in good health. I’d like to, Sire... I’d like so very much... Mein Gott! - Kathrine! - Oh, mein Gott! Thank God, his Highness feels better. - And Elisabeth? - Elisabeth? Her illness is progressing, she’s getting weaker and weaker. But the eyes of Barbara Radziwill... shine brighter and brighter. So, you know? A manor in the forest, a veiled woman, nightly visits... Elizabeth doesn't know anything. And only this should now be important to our father. And to me? As for you, my gracious Lady, I have to ask you for consideration due to my wife. And to share the properties of Polish queens with her. What’s that? Am I to give back what I received from the King? There are two queens in Poland now. Therefore, justice requires that each of them receives what is due to her. These properties have been taken care of by me. They’ve been brought to a thriving state, thanks to me! - Yes, I know, but... - I will give up nothing! Nothing! How is the young Queen? Do you have any news? No. Neither a letter nor a messenger for a week. That’s strange. Just now, when she should be enjoying the dowry gowns she received. Do your envoys know anything? When the young King is here, Hlebowicz doesn’t send envoys. We will have to send someone to Vilnius. I want to know about my daughter's health. A lack of news usually bodes well. But I will send an envoy. It seems to me that I didn’t call anyone. Your Highness, we bring painful and important news. There is a message from Vilnius. The young Queen... Queen Elizabeth... Is she ill? I cannot say it. Let’s pray for her soul. She died suddenly. Repeat! She died on the 15th of June. My God... Elisabeth! How is that possible? You said, you left her in good health! I did. I don’t understand, what could have happened? Little Elizabeth... Was her illness that grave? I don’t know it was. Get off one of you. - Who? - You, you will hear my confession. It’s not right, Your Majesty. The Archbishop is coming with us. What were you ordained for? To refuse service when it is needed? I had a bad dream. I need relief. I have sinned a lot. I hurt our first queen, Elizabeth, without mercy. I will confess this and you will absolve me. Maybe the bad in me will disappear. Has it been a long time since you have been to confession, my Son? Very long. I don’t remember when. You have already forgotten, my Son, what confession is like. Kneel down. You don't know humility, you don't know what repentance is! Understand that and come to confession again! You... - Are you travelling with them? - Whom else, Sire? With servants? Leave those blind fools! Give him a horse for the entire journey! This way, Sire. The mistress doesn't know anything. Stay here and keep watch. Are you not welcoming me? Aren’t you running to meet me? Thank you. I will see you later. Frightened? Why, for God’s sake? What can happen to you with me here? The Ginger has harassed and threatened me. And the Black... I will send him that Arab, he praised so much. He will be pleased. I’m not sure of that. My Lord... The brothers beg that you don’t come here at night. - That you spare them the shame. - Oh, yes? And who talked me into hunting here, wasn’t it the Ginger? Who sent you to me every night, wasn’t it the Black? Our passionate love didn't bother them then. But lately evil tongues... Don't listen to them, my beloved! They don’t read Ariosto or Aretino. And I was captivated by that boldness of yours, by your ardour in loving, by the passion of your embraces. Don't look away. Remember how much we have in common. - Unforgettable nights... - Yes... True passion... - without a lie. - Yes. - And a lifelong friendship. - Yes Aren’t you pleased that, contrary to my word given, I succumbed to temptation and came? Such a hot August night. Please, give me a smile. Free yourself of that frown. It is my birthday today. It is almost a crown holiday, and we seem separated by penance. Won't you drink for my health on such a solemn day? My Lord... Your slave is happy even in the forest. As long as she is with you. As long as she is close to you. Always... This is an ambush! What’s that? Force against a royal servant in my presence? Unbelievable! Our humble greetings, your Highness. Thank you for the honour of your presence. However, we were not aware that we would receive a guest! Sire, we received a promise, that your Highness would desist visiting our sister, in secret! - And I kept my word. - For two weeks. Let me speak! Sire, you cannot deny that you are here. Therefore, we would kindly ask why you came? I came in secret. You are the one making this matter public! - Because of the infamy... - And human slander... What do you know? Perhaps my visit to your sister tonight will bring you great honour and benefit? - And glory as well. - I’m true to my word. If not shame, but glory is to come from this nightly meeting, and if you truly love our sister, we ask you humbly, Sire... I entrust myself to you, my Lord. I swear, I did not intend that! Sire, we ask and won’t stop asking. Swear by the cross and before the priest. Enough! I will make a promise out of good and free will. Because no one has ever obtained anything from me by force. And never will! Therefore, I swear by the cross and of my good will that I love this woman truly, respect her and won’t let anyone hurt her. Some wine, Sire? Those are the first bright moments in our dark journey. There will be more of them, Sire. Death has separated you from her, and it will free you from the grief over her. And deprive me of this last consolation. Grief won’t provide you with relief, Sire. It’s time to come back to the land of the living. Death can take someone from us, but that person can stay within us. What we keep in our memory belongs to us. Would you write an epitaph for her? - I thought about it, Sire. - And? Can you not do it? - I know how I would start. - How? “Deep sleep, hard and restless got hold of her…” Maybe differently. “You abandoned us forever… frightened forever into the land of eternal night”. Did you bury anyone, Anonymous? Don’t ask, Sire. Man is not made of stone. Sigismondo! At last! I hurried day and night. I welcome you and join you in your pain. Your Highness. Why did you order that the Marshal of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Radziwill, would not be allowed to come here with me? Such treatment is an insult to me. My Lord. He was with me. And I’m asking, by what right? Why are you silent, my Lady? Because there are no bad intentions in it. None... So why, when I was greeted, was I told about French envoys, who I am to receive today? I was hoping Sire, that for the good of Poland and your sister Isabel you will agree to a marriage with the French princess. For your country, for Isabel... What about me? I order to send for Prince Radziwill. I want to see him. Here! My Lord… For God’s sake! - It can’t be! - I wish for it! And I won’t talk to the French envoys! Your Highness! They are not needed here. Unless, they’ll wait until after the mourning ceremonies for the arrival... Don’t say it, don’t say anything! ...for the arrival in Krakow of our beloved wife, Barbara Radziwill. Long live the King! A new order has begun. May it be for the glory of Poland. That’s amusing! It seemed simple to you to come here and obtain my consent. For what? For the shame of the Jagiellon dynasty? What kind of wife is one married in secret, without the consent of deputies and senators? Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I will rip that consent out of their throats. Today, I have come to ask. It’s not easy for me because you abuse and allow the abuse of my wife. You can taint this love, you can. But you cannot rip her out of my heart, out of my guts! You are the king! But a human being as well! First of all... and above all... you are a king! You don’t want the crown on her brow, is it not so? I cannot want it. Does it mean that if I were to refrain from Barbara’s solemn coronation, without breaking the vows… A legitimate heir to the throne must be born to a queen! A crowned queen of Poland. So, she should become one. I already said... Never. So, what do you consent to? To annulling the secret vows and another marriage. And nothing more? Bene. Sigismondo, what do you want to fight for? For your own alcove matters, jeopardizing the Crown's majesty? Love her. I never forbade you to love. - This one, another one... - She will be the first. And the only one. But if he wants to be sure that I love him truly? - Not for the glory of the crown! - Pure nonsense! Human lust is in him and southern blood. He acquired a taste for your sweet lips! But he will tire of passionate embraces and love games! And then he will consider another marriage. For the dynasty. For Poland. Do not frighten me! It’s demanding already. Never mind. I thought that the news about... an heir to the throne will gladden him. What? Good Lord! On the eve of the opening of the Sejm that’s of vital news! Not any longer. Last night... my Lady... barely stopped the blood flow. That is why I’m so weak, half alive… - And you... - Damn it! An apple tree, which loses its fruit, goes under the axe! I will send an envoy for herbwomen today. But before they come and bring help we have to act! Does the Kings know the reason of your weakness? Not yet. You have to ask, no, demand to be installed at Wawel Castle. Now, whilst there is time! What joy the house of Radziwill would feel at the words, “Your Royal Highness!” No! Never! Finally, may I remind you that this royal matrimony was concluded against the law and customs, without our consent! And when the King and our Lord himself breaks the law, how is our country to fare? Already the new princes, who received their titles from the Habsburgs with gratitude, look down upon the true princes of Lithuania! Upon esteemed families in the Polish Kingdom! They threaten us, faithful servants of the Crown! Us, the senators! Since no one is in favour of this secret marriage, may you allow, Your Highness, that the entire nobility would speak through the mouths of its chosen ones. Let the deputies come and let them say what they think! Lord Marshal! Our Gracious Lord has already heard the voices of the senators. Who wants to speak now on behalf of all deputies? I do. It is not my wish, but rather a need. Because that is how King Zygmunt the Old taught me. To speak when it is right to speak. To say “Yes” or “No”. He also taught me how to overcome oneself and those passions that lead to evil that defy the hopes, the desires and the will of the entire nation. Therefore, I’m asking: what he would say now? If he saw your Royal Highness bound to his subject by secret vows? What would he exclaim on hearing that you offended the Senate? That you spurned the Chamber of Deputies, by acting without their advice and will. My Lord, you do not want to commence your royal powers by destroying our laws. Therefore, we beg you, your Royal Highness, we beg you humbly, in the name of the God who built the Polish Kingdom so great and powerful despite its modest beginnings, abandon what you are doing. Do not call a marriage something that cannot be one. Do not diminish our kingdom, and do not blame us, your servants, for standing up today for the Polish Crown, the glory of the Jagiellon home, and for the need of a good name of us all and yourself. I am touched by your speech and I cannot say any more in my defence. Yet, one thing is sure, what is done, is done. And so it must remain. I will not break my vows given before God. Vows given to whom?! To Gashtold’s widow? A woman not fit to appear before the altar of the Lord! Members of the Council! Deputies! This lady brought shame onto the Crown! And affront to the monarchy! It is a disgrace and a horror that our lips speak about this unworthy woman! All she deserves is scolding, abuse and cursing! Governor of Krakow!! He silenced the Senator Marshal! I will not hear any more speeches about my marriage. I vowed to my wife and God observes that I favour weighing my promise more than the kingdom and the weight of the crown. The choice is yours. The assembly is over. No! Never! Do not look, Sire. It can cloud the bravest mind. - Leave Sire, please. - Persevere Sire. This is just dust. She is already somewhere else. - Persevere in hope. - In hope for what, you stubborn man? We will all turn to dust! We came here from distant lands and we Will find each other in distant lands. Negligence! Negligence! What are you doing, you wretched man? Do you want to offend the royal family? You are still young, sir, so you may not know. I am doing my duty. Monsignor, for the love of God! What does that mean? Your Excellency, Your Majesty! They always do it, I really don't know! The previous priest, the late Father Franciszek Drypa has already... But that is our gravedigger! He… Your Excellency, I was ordained in Krakow. They have sent me here, to Lithuania! Lithuania, Your Highness! Enough. Lift the priest up. Come closer. Explain yourself. My Lord, I do not know what death looks like in Poland, but here in Lithuania, it is a woman with a sting in her mouth; it sucks the venom from a corpse and feeds it to the living. That is why we leave scissors for the deceased to have something to cut the sting off. We always bury Lithuanians like that, and the royal deceased was a Lithuanian after all. But no one asked you to perform your pagan rites here! Leave him, Ostoja, he meant well. Let him go. He told the truth. Barbara was a Lithuanian. Do your duties. Ostoja... this is a ghost! If I would not have seen it with my own eyes... My Lord! Fate sends us a double. Do what tradition requires! You didn't want it in Krakow, do it at least here! A few miles! Good. Give her this to wear. Bathe her in the river. Unbelievable. She could pose for our lady's portrait, she is so much like her. The queen’s eyes were more emphatic, raised at the corners. Her hair was darker. Her mouth was similar, maybe the same. Does everyone at court remember her so well? Those who wanted. Oh Lord! The crown of your faithful! Bless this ornate crown so that your servant who will wear it be a woman of numerous virtues. Receive the crown of glory and happiness so that you deserve perpetual joy in heaven. Amen. If Albert of Prussia was here, he would sit by the King. But he is not. This is an insult to us. But his envoys will inevitably pay tribute. They will because they have to. As all dependent princes. Only she is getting paler and paler. Let us hope she lasts until the end. - What is wrong with her? - Jesus! My Lords... We cannot pass, Sire! The forest is on fire! We have to turn to the right, Sire. This way, the fire does not reach there. We will cross the Neman by a ford and continue on the road near Grodno. Give the orders. And send a rider to Prince Radziwill, so that he does not miss us. Turn back! Turn back towards the ford! Turn back! My Lord, let her go she is weak, she is afraid! Go with God, good people. Sire, the gown, the gown! To the right! - Move! - Go to the town! Giddy-up, giddy-up! Giddy-up, horsey, giddy-up! Mush! Whoa, stop! The coffin, save the coffin! - The coffin! - Hold it here! Take the coffin, take it ashore! Quickly! Move! Take it up! - Help me! - Hold it tight! - Support it! - Up, up, together! I am pulling you. Go on, go on! Hold it! Anonymous, have you lost it? It is no harm. This is our duty that fate destined for us. It’s not time to discuss it yet. When is the time for it then? We must enjoy every moment. Yes. When I could, I lived well. Then, in the monastery the nuns healed my body, my broken bone. And a holy old hermit healed my soul. I have a favour to ask. I will do anything. Just get well again. I want... in case... - if I die... - No, don’t say it! You cannot leave me! You cannot leave! I cannot... but... if such was God’s will, then... please, do not bury me here, but in Vilnius. Do you remember? We were so happy there... I will do as you wish, but only after many years. One day. I do not believe it. I will never be different. I will sleep now... maybe... if... - if only... - If what? it wasn't so cold. Is this better now? My beloved... But... Why is your arm so cold, so heavy? So cold... - Cold... - Barbara? Cold... Very... very cold... Cold. Listen, Sire, to what the poet has to say. There is a certain limit to suffering, beyond which a cheerful smile begins.
