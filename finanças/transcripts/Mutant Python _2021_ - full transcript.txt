(TENSE GONG MUSIC) [NARRATOR] I have lived in the village of Beilao in northern Fujian since I was a child. Such a closed off and backwards place. An old custom has been passed down in this village from ancient times to the present day. [WOMAN] Wenlin! (TENSE MUSIC) The time has come. Raise the grave! [NARRATOR] The villagers of Beilao believe that because of the humid climate in northern Fujian, the bones of their ancestors buried in the ground are prone to decay and mold, which will bring bad luck to future generations of relatives. Therefore, every 20 years, the next generation of relatives will call the worthless beggar into the tomb to pick up the bones out and wash and dry them before putting them back in place to seal the tomb. (TENSE MUSIC) Let me see. (STARTLING MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Snake! Snake! (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (MAN SHOUTING) (SNAKE SLITHERING) Snake! Snake! (PERSON GRUNTING AND YELPING) Snake, snake! The Long Snake Fairy is revealed! Kneel quickly, kneel quickly, kneel quickly! This snake is poisonous. There's someone in there, we have to help them. This snake is not to be messed with. You want to get us killed? If you don't help them, then I will. Wenlin, take care of your sister. Dad! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (SNAKES SLITHERING) (PERSON GROANING) (TENSE GONG MUSIC) [NARRATOR] My ancestors have lived here for generations. I used to think this isolated place was simple. I would think to myself that it was a paradise. But I was wrong. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) The time has come. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (WATER SPLASHING) (SNAKE ROARING) The Snake Fairy is revealed! Please spare my life, Snake Fairy! Please spare my life, Snake Fairy! Please spare my life, Snake Fairy! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (PEOPLE SHOUTING) (SNAKE GROWLING) Snake meat? It's okay. Mom. Did you two go back to fight the snake again? Mom. How many times have I told you? If people in the village find out about this, we'll get into a lot of trouble! (TENSE MUSIC) Please don't blame them. Young people don't know the rules. Mom. How can you still believe that in this day and age? Your father messed with the Long Snake Fairy and we had to suffer for it. Wenlin, we were expelled from the Dong family for this. [WENLIN] No, wait, that was hard to catch. Mom. Do you want me to die sooner? Mom, don't be angry. Mom, you go in first, go. Brother, let's release the snake, hurry up, let's go! (BIRDS CHIRPING) - Patriarch. - Patriarch. - Patriarch. - Greetings, greetings. - Patriarch. - Greetings. - Brother. - Yes. Everything is back. Wenyu is having the room tidied up. Don't worry about a thing. The wedding will be a great success! That's wonderful. Thank you for your hard work. Ah, no problem. Hey, be careful. (GONG RINGING) [BOY] Bro. This horse is amazing! [MAN] What's the big deal? It's just an animal for people to ride. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Don't look. - This is a rough place. - Really? Why? [MAN] Don't ask. Xiuqin, beyond here is the village of Beilao. The second lady, one pillow. It's a mandarin duck pillow. Eh? Where's the invitation? What? Invitation? That won't do. How many people are seated there? It's all booked! - There's a wait list. - Uncle? Chunhua! I'm coming! (COINS CLINK) Zhang Chunhua. Five silver dollars. Eh? Where's the invitation? [CHUNHUA] I've lived in this village for seven years now, and no one will even eat this tofu I made. Even if I have an invitation, I won't be allowed in. Don't you think so, Uncle? Yes, yes. That certainly isn't right. Go in, go in! (GENTLE MUSIC) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (FIRECRACKERS POPPING) (TENSE MUSIC) (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD APPLAUDING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (SNAKE SLITHERING) Let's let Sister Chunhua have one. - Okay! - Shall we? Come on. (LAUGHS) (WOMAN VOCALIZING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (CROWD CHATTERING) Brother. Get her out of here. This is outrageous. Wenyu. Hey, hey, Chunhua. Slow down. You should go back. Don't go out anywhere. Eh? What are you doing out here? Just go back, and keep an eye on the place for me. (INSECTS CHIRPING) (DOG BARKING DISTANTLY) (CHUNHUA VOCALIZING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (GASPS) Uncle. What are you doing? Chunhua, it must be hard for you to live alone. No, no, Uncle! You can live with me, yeah? I've been waiting a long time for you. From now on, I'll let you eat and drink with me. Come on, come on! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) No! No, Uncle! No! - Yeah. - No! Help! (WATER SPLASHING) (MUFFLED SHOUTING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Help! Help! No! [MAN] Bitch! (WATER BUBBLING) (SNAKE HISSING) (MAN SHOUTING) (WATER SPLASHING) Help me! (MAN GURGLING) (TENSE MUSIC) [CHUNHUA] Snake, snake, snake. Chunhua? Chunhua? [CHUNHUA] The snake has eaten Uncle. - This snake has eaten Uncle. - What did you just say? What did you say about my father? Your father... Your father was eaten by a big snake. (PEOPLE GASP) Go and take a look! - Let's go! - Let's go! Dad, I'm going too. You can't go. It's your big day. Take care of Xiuqin. Wenhui, a snake? Xiuqin, remain calm, large snakes are native to these mountains, but don't worry, it hasn't entered the village since ancient times. (TENSE MUSIC) Dad! Dad! What are you doing here? I was just passing by. San wandered out here drunk. Why are you here? He tried to take advantage. What are you talking about? If you slander my father again, I'll kill you! I'm not lying. He just pushed me down right here. You're still talking nonsense, I'll kill you! Let's talk this out, okay? I can take care of this lying bitch. It's none of your business. Are you an adulterer, huh? Wenyu Dong, what are you saying? (WENYU CHUCKLES) (STARTLING MUSIC) (WOMAN GASPS) (MEN GRUNTING) What are you doing? Come on! (MEN GRUNTING) [MAN] Let's kill him! (WATER SPLASHING) (TENSE MUSIC) (MEN GRUNTING) Poor Zhaoru, lived with nobody, now dead with nobody. A fate of bad luck, huh? The Long Snake Fairy has not entered the village for 10 years. This time it suddenly came. There must be something fishy in it. The Long Snake Fairy didn't come at some random time, but came at the time of your bride's wedding. Did the bride bring the Long Snake Fairy with her? Wenyu! What do you mean? Oh, nothing. It's just that everyone's talking about it. You're talking too much. I don't come back often, so we'll go back to the province after the wedding. I'll never come back to this shit again. (PORCELAIN CLATTERS) Shut up! Cease this arguing, or I'll banish all of you! Patriarch, how do we make the Long Snake Fairy stop? The only way to make the Long Snake Fairy stop is to use the method left behind by our ancestors. (TENSE MUSIC) Dad! - Shut up. - Dad! Get the hell out of here! Get out! Wenhui? Wenhui? You mean... You want to use the way of our ancestors. We have to find a girl named Dong who is pure and innocent to offer to the Snake Fairy. (TENSE MUSIC) Where can we find such an innocent girl? Mom. Anyway, we have to find a girl who is named Dong. You mean as long as the surname is Dong... Even one who has been expelled, yes? (TENSE MUSIC) Wenlin. Don't get into trouble in the future. Avoid places where there are many people, and don't get into trouble. Mom, I don't want to cause trouble, trouble wants to cause me. (DOOR BANGS OPEN) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What are you doing?! - Mom! - No! - Brother! - Wenjuan! (MEN GRUNTING) Wenjuan! Wenlin, we have to do this the old-fashioned way. It's your family's good fortune. She's just going to the fairy world now. (MEN GRUNTING) You bastard, let her go! Wenlin. Brother! Brother! (MEN GRUNTING) Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Brother! Brother! Brother! Move it. (MAN GRUNTS) Brother! - Wenjuan! - Brother! Brother! Wenlin! - Let me go! - Come on! - Let me go! - Hurry up! (TENSE MUSIC) Some on! [GIRL] Stop it! - Wenyu Dong, let me go! - Stop struggling! - Let me go! - Knock it off! Stop it! Uncle! Wenjuan, you must not resent your people. It's your family's good fortune to serve the Snake Fairy in the honor of the Dong family. In five days it will be the 9th day of the 6th month. The full moon. At that time, the Dong family will send Wenjuan to enter the Long Snake immortal world. Yes, sir. Uncle! Uncle, I'm Wenjuan! You can't, Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! You can't do this, Uncle! Wenhui, just now, Dong Wenyu caught a girl in the barn. Oh. What has the girl done wrong? Why is he arresting her? (SOLEMN MUSIC) She hasn't done anything wrong. It's because she isn't married, at that age, and... Her surname. What do you mean? Whenever the Long Snake Fairy causes trouble, a young Dong girl is sacrificed for 10 years of peace in the village. A real sacrifice? But that's a real human life. This is a rule inherited from the ancestors. Wenhui. You've been educated in the capital and you still believe in this? No way. I have to tell Father to let the little girl go. Xiuqin. Don't worry about it. It was Dad's idea. If you let the little girl go, the whole clan will kill you. Even I can't protect you. Then you'll let me watch the sacrifice of the girl? (WENHUI SIGHS) Just pretend you don't know anything. We'll be back in the province in three days. (WENHUI SIGHS) It'll all be out of sight and out of mind. I didn't think you were such a person. I don't know who made breakfast today, but I feel sick. I'm going to the toilet, you watch her. Wait for me, I'm not feeling well either (TENSE MUSIC) Wenjuan. Come on. - Wenlin Dong. - (STARTLING MUSIC) I was waiting for you. You've got a lot of nerve. This is a sacrifice to the Snake Fairy, and you dare to touch it? You are breaking the family law. Brothers, break his legs. (PEOPLE GRUNTING) Brother! (TENSE MUSIC) Don't anyone run away. If anyone lets her go, I'll expel him from the family. Get back! Brother! Beat him to death! Brother! Don't do it! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother, don't mind me! Go now, don't mind me! You go now! - Go after him! - (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (TENSE MUSIC) Wenyu Dong, don't you know the rules? I'm a woman alone at home, and you come in without knocking? What's wrong with you guys? Why'd you come in here without knocking? I'm sorry, Sister. They're not well-mannered. Sister, did you see a man come in? What do you mean? Are you saying I'm hiding a man? Do you believe me that I'll tell Wenhui? Oh, no. I didn't mean it like that We're arresting someone, a thief. Do you see any thieves here? Where could they be? I think the cupboard is the only place in my house where someone could hide. But I'm telling you, if you don't find anyone in this cupboard, I'll go to my father and tell him you've ruined my innocence. What are you doing? Sister, it's all a misunderstanding. How could I possibly suspect you? If there's really a man in this room, it could only be my brother. Why are you still standing here? Go to find him! (MAN CHUCKLING) Excuse me. (SHAKY BREATHING) - Thank you. - I've seen you before. Last time. Last time you were with a girl, at the entrance to the village. (GASPS) The girl who was arrested. It's my sister, Wenjuan. But Dong Wenyu and his brothers are guarding her. You can't just barge in like that. I can't just stand by and watch my sister being sacrificed. But you won't be able to save your sister, and you might even get yourself killed. (SOLEMN MUSIC) You'll have to find a way to save her. What are you thinking? Do you know what logic means? What? I don't, sorry. Ah, let me give you an example. One plus one equals two is not logic. Two plus two equals four is not logic either. But one plus one plus two equals four, that's logic. Fine. Let me ask you, why is your sister being sacrificed? The Long Snake Fairy. And what if the Long Snake Fairy died? You're saying that... But I can't kill that big snake. Not by myself, anyway. Then go and find someone who can kill the snake. (WENLIN GRUNTING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SNAKE HISSING) (TENSE MUSIC) (SNAKE HISSING) - Help! - (MAN GRUNTING) Help me! Don't touch me! - Don't touch me! - Sister! - Don't touch me! - Wenyu Dong! What the hell? Sister. Misunderstanding. I just came to see Wenjuan. (WENJUAN GASPS) [WENJUAN] Brother! (EERIE MUSIC) Brother! Brother! Brother! Thank you, Master Wong, for saving me. You recovered quickly. You bastard If it weren't for my master, you'd be dead, huh? [MASTER WONG] Enough. What brings you to our place? You're not a thief, are you? (LAUGHS) No no no. I've heard that Master Wong is the best snake catcher ever. Nonsense! I'm the second best. No one would dare to call me the first best snake catcher! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Pay attention. There are many schools of thought when it comes to catching snakes, from unarmed, forked, blindfolded, illuminated, netted, iron pliers, et cetera. Yes, yes. Sure, the exact choice depends on the type of snake to be caught, size poisonous or non-poisonous, and whether or not - you are single. - Single? I'm telling you, you're just waiting to die every day, aren't you, huh? How many times have I told you, but you can't remember? The snake also has a male and a female, to determine whether it is single or not is to cast it in the right direction. But Master, what if that snake... (MAN GROANING) I forgot to ask you, where did you come from, and where are you going to invite us to catch a snake? Beilao village. What? [BOTH] Beilao village?! (JOWLS FLAPPING) The people of Beilao Village are known for their respect of the snakes as immortals. I'd be scared to death if I went there to catch a snake. I don't have anything of value on me, this is all I have. I have always been a man of principle. You know what, I accept your offer. For catching snakes, this more than suffices as payment. But let's be clear, this is only a deposit. After the job is done, the snake will be mine. As long as I can save my sister, it won't be a problem. Your sister How old is your sister? And is she married? My student is always thinking about getting a wife. Ermao, don't worry. When we finish this job, I promise, I will find you a wife. (TENSE MUSIC) (MEN GRUNTING) (SNAKE SLITHERING) (INSECTS CHIRPING) Wenlin. Wenlin. Mom? It's me. Is there someone in the kitchen? A passer-by. - For a bowl of water. - Oh, just two passers-by. I felt sorry for them. Oh, then get them something to eat. (TENSE MUSIC) (INSECTS CHIRPING) Sir. Are you feeling bad? No, I'm fine. Just a little hungry Hungry? Ermao. You have to find some food for the master. It would be best if you can get a drumstick. But Master, in such a late hour, how can I get you a drumstick? There's no drumstick, but you find one anyway, only then can you show your ability. - I... - What are you waiting for? Hurry up and go, huh? Do you want to kill your master with hunger, huh? Okay, okay, okay. (INSECTS CHIRPING) (DOG BARKING DISTANTLY) It's such a late hour. Where can I find a drumstick? (SNAKE SLITHERING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ERMAO SIGHS) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Brother. (MAN GRUNTS) I just don't get it. My father's health was good, why did he die so easily? And your brother. What are he doing there in the middle of the night? And that Zhang Chunhua. If not because of her, my father wouldn't have been swallowed by a snake! That woman is just a vulture! I don't like that woman either. Always smells like a slut. Filthy whore. She's a slut and everyone knows it. She's the one. I've been waiting to fix this bitch for a long time. Okay. Let's go dip her in a pig cage. - Let's go! - Let's go. - Dip her in the cage! - Let's go! (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Soak her in the cage. [MAN] Yeah, soak her in the cage! [MAN] Yeah, we'll throw her in the pig cage. (chuckles) (TENSE MUSIC) Let's go! (INSECTS CHIRPING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GENTLE MUSIC) (TENSE MUSIC) - Hurry up! - Let's go! Come on! (TENSE MUSIC) - Come on, follow me. - Come on! Hurry up! (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Open the door! Open the door! I know you're in there. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Open the door! If you don't open the door, I'll kill you! Mazu bless, God bless, Master bless, Amitabha. Ah, whatever. If anyone's listening, just send help, okay? [MAN] Brother Wenyu, kick it hard. Brothers. Find and catch that bitch. Don't let her get away. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Brother, there's no one here. Zhang Chunhua is gone. Brother Wenyu, looks like she ran away. (TENSE MUSIC) (SNAKE SLITHERING) (STARTLING MUSIC) (ERMAO GASPS) Don't make a sound. It's okay, she can't get away. (TENSE MUSIC) Go check over there. Little Pigtail, go check it out. What are you doing? There's gunpowder in there. You want to die? (OMINOUS MUSIC) (SNAKE SLITHERING) This bitch must be here. (TENSE MUSIC) (SNAKE SLITHERING) (MAN WHIMPERING) The snake. It's huge. Pigtail. Pigtail! You're too loud. You'll attract the snake. I don't want to shake either, but I can't stop. (ERMAO GROANS) Pigtail. (TENSE MUSIC) Snake, snake. Snake Fairy. What are you doing? Run. When the snake finishes eating them, it will eat us next. Run! - Quick, quick, quick! - Go, go, go! - Go, go, go. - Run, run, run! [ERMAO] Hurry up, hurry up! It's Chunhua! - It's Chunhua! - Don't run. (SNAKE HISSING) Run. Run! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (MAN SHOUTING) (WENJUAN GASPS) Don't be afraid I'm here to get you out. You belong to the first wife. Why are you saving me? We'll talk later when we get out. (INSECTS CHIRPING) (DOORS BANG OPEN) Tie them up. Don't do this to her! Son. This woman is your wife. Are you going to tie her up and take her back home, or do I need to send someone to lock her up? No, Dad, Xiuqin is new to us. She doesn't know the rules here. Please forgive her once. - Xiuqin. - I won't go back! Unless you let Wenjuan go. Dad, this is a living human life. How can you sacrifice her to your so-called Snake Fairy? That's ridiculous. Dad, what Xiuqin means is... What a useless thing. Good girl. Don't be afraid. - Go back with Wenhui, huh? - But... - You need to go! - What are you doing? Dong Wenhui, get off me! Dong Wenhui! Let me go! Put me down! Dong Wenhui! The snake! There's a snake! There's a snake! - What's going on? - A snake. It ate my brother. Wenyu, go to build the altar. At midnight tomorrow, we'll sacrifice the girl - to the Long Snake Fairy! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! Why did you throw it away? Didn't your father ask you to tie me up too? Go ahead. Send me and the girl to be sacrificed tomorrow. You're my wife. I'll see who dares to sacrifice you. Your father. Your father would dare. Will you disobey your father for me? (SOLEMN MUSIC) Xiuqin. Listen to me. You don't know Beilao village. Wenhui. I regret. I regret marrying you. I regret coming to your house. I regret ever knowing you. (SOLEMN MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) The chains and the smoke. If it can't control the snake, then we must try to lure it here. This is our last chance. Master. Big guy. Can they listen to us? Master Wong. Why not just lead the snake here? (MASTER WONG LAUGHING) It's up to the person who makes it happen. - Oh. - (TENSE MUSIC) Master! Master! What is he doing? Ha, I'm not surprised. Master is watching the grass lodging. Looking for a snake trail. The so-called snake path is the place where the snake has crawled. The traces left behind. This is the snake trail. We can follow the snake trail to find the snake cave. Follow it. I found it. (OMINOUS MUSIC) I found the snake cave. Ermao. Hurry up. Get ready to work. (TENSE MUSIC) Big snakes love to eat lettuce oil. Brush this. It'll lure the snake out. Come on, let's go to work. (PIG GRUNTING) Get in there. Come on. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (BELLS RINGING) (ERMAO SHOUTING) Little brat. Slow down. Master, I want to slow down too! This chain is pulling me! (ERMAO SHOUTING) Master, save me! (ERMAO GRUNTING) Help me!

Move. (ERMAO COUGHING) Be patient. It will be smoked out in a moment. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) What is Master Wong doing? Oh, this is an occult science, old school. It's a snake control method from India. (SNAKE SLITHERING) (WENLIN GASPING) (WENLIN GRUNTS) (SNAKE SCREECHING) (SNAKE ROARS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (SNAKE SCREECHING) Master! Is it ready? It's coming!

If you are alive, then run away! I don't need to teach you that. Hurry, run to the trap! (SNAKE SHRIEKING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Run to the trap, quickly! (SNAKE SHRIEKING) The snake. Lead it to the trap. (WENLIN GRUNTS) (SNAKE SHRIEKING) - Get out of the way! - (SNAKE SHRIEKING) (TRAPS SNAPPING) (SNAKE SHRIEKING) Pity that the snake skin is ruined. But luckily, snake meat is really quite good. Master Wong. Huh? All of this was just for the snake skin? - Well... - (FIREWORKS BOOMING) Wenlin, the sacrifice will happen soon. You have to hurry up. Master Wong. Can you give me the snake first? My sister's life is at stake. No, we had a deal. The snake is mine. Besides, I only agreed to help you kill the snake. I didn't promise to help you save people. The matter in your village is none of my business. Ermao, pack up and let's go. Master. Should we help them? Help what? You talk too much. Get to work. Wait a sec, Master Wong. Killing snakes and saving people are the same. You can have the snake and you can still help his sister. Moreover, we do not want the snake. We just want to tell them their so-called Long Snake Fairy is just an ordinary snake, so that we don't have to sacrifice anymore. Fine. We'll help just this once. Ermao? When you're done, remember to bring me back the snake. - Okay, Master! - Thank you, Master Wong. Thank you. Once I rescue my sister, I'll bring the snake right back. Let's get to work! (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) - Wenyu. - Yes. - Let's start. - Okay. (SOLEMN MUSIC) (FIRECRACKERS POPPING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Wenhui, quickly, tell Dad. This won't save the villagers at all. You'll throw away their lives for nothing. Brother! Brother! The big snake is dead. From now on, no more Snake Fairies will harm the village. None of you will hurt my sister! (PEOPLE MURMURING) Please forgive me, Snake Fairy! [ALL] Please forgive me, Snake Fairy! Please forgive me, Snake Fairy! Please forgive me, Snake Fairy! Somebody! Arrest these two scourges immediately! (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Listen to me! For all these years, the snake has harmed our village. I'm trying to help you! How dare you give up the ways of our ancestors? - (MAN GRUNTS) - Down. (TENSE MUSIC) (MAN GRUNTS) (MASTER WONG LAUGHS) You little brat. Listen up. The twine has been soaked in rapeseed oil for 749 days. You won't be able to escape. You bastard! I'll kill you for this! Master, you're here. If I hadn't come, you kids would see the king of hell. As for your village's business, I do not care at all. But my disciple and this snake I have to take back. My guy don't need you to teach him a lesson. Are you all enjoying the show? Arrest him! (PEOPLE SHOUTING) Master. What are we supposed to do now? I don't know, I've tried everything that I can, but I still couldn't fool them. Patriarch! All three culprits should be arrested. We should sacrifice them! - Tie them up first. - Yeah, arrest them! Don't ruin the ritual of the Long Snake Fairy. Help! Let me go! - Wenjuan, don't be afraid! - Stop struggling! Wenjuan, I'm here, don't be afraid! Don't move! Don't! Dong Wenhui, you coward! If you won't help, I will. Shame on my Dong family! (SOLEMN MUSIC) (FIRE CRACKLING) [WENLIN] Wenjuan!

Wake up, all of you! Don't be so stupid anymore! Instead of letting the snake kill you, why don't you stand up and fight back? There are so many of us. If we work together, we can definitely kill this scourge. You've angered the Long Snake Fairy. That's why this is happening! - Yeah! - Yeah! - That's right! - That's right! - Yeah! - Yeah! If it weren't for you, this wouldn't have happened. [MAN] It's you! The Long Snake Fairy, as you call him, it's a devil. If you continue to believe this superstition, you will only lose more relatives. Master Wong. I beg you. Kill this beast. I'm afraid I cannot deal with it. I still have to save my life. I have to take my disciple back to the country. Chunhua? My Ermao. Oh, oh, oh. I'm willing to join you in killing the python! (PEOPLE SHOUTING) Dad. Patriarch. (TENSE MUSIC) Chen Ermao? You must come back alive. Kill the python. In the future, I will go wherever you go. Master. Please come with us too. I'm afraid you won't be able to come back and marry your wife. I won't go. You will only be sent to death. This python king is too big. We can't fight it head-on. We can only try to find its nest. Then use explosives. - Explosives? - Yeah. - I know where some are. - Where? (TENSE MUSIC) Ermao. Load everything up. We're taking it all with us. (TENSE MUSIC) Come on, load this. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (WENJUAN COUGHING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) It shouldn't be far away. Follow me. (RAT SQUEAKS) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Master. What's this? Luckily we got here in time. If all these snake eggs had hatched, the consequences would have been unthinkable. Then what are you waiting for? Let's smash them! Wait a minute. The python will definitely come back to hatch the eggs. We'll bury the explosives here, and as soon as the python arrives, detonate the explosives immediately. We'll really give it to the snake and then take care of this once and for all. Ermao, Wenlin. Go get the explosives ready. You, guard the entrance. - Okay. - Hurry. (TENSE MUSIC) (GUNSHOT BANGS) Snake. Snake. Snake. Big snake. - Big snake! - Snake? (ERMAO GASPS) (SNAKE ROARING) Ermao! Light explosives! Hurry!
