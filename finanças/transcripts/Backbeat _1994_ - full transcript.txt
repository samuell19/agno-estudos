"I went out on a limb for you "and you're gonna toss it away "to go and play bass in John Lennon's skiffle band." It's not a skiffle band. He's gonna say... It's a rock and roll band. "I opened the doors for you..." It's not my band. Yeah, that's what he'll say. It's a group. We're a group. We're in it together. He's gonna shit himself. I like Arthur. You know, he's all right. But he thinks art's something you gotta hang on the wall in a pool of light. It's a disease with him. He thinks it's all about Van Gogh. Ah, nothing wrong with Van Gogh. Oh, no, I had a word with Van Gogh. Did ya? Bumped into him the other night in The Grapes. Yeah? Yeah. I said, "Vincent, mate, where did it all go wrong?" You know what he said? Been meaning to tell you this. No, what did he say? He said, "If I could do it all again, "I'd be up there shaking me bum "doing Blue Suede Shoes. "It's all dick," that's what he said. I gave him your regards. Ah, thanks. You're a painter, Stu. You are the best I've got. I'm coming back. And it's a pisser to throw it away, man I'm not throwing anything away.

I've told you before, Paul, I won't tell you again. If you kick Stu out of this band I'll go with him. No, you won't. You fucking won't and I'll tell you why, sailor, because you know how good we can be. Not without me. And you're not gonna kiss it goodbye. Oh, just watch me, mate. What is then? What is it between you two? What is it? Yeah, what's going on? Are you saying I'm a queer? Is that what you're saying? Oh, look. Are you saying I'm a fucking fairy, is that what you're saying, Paul? That's not what I said, that's not what I said. What is it, that's what you said. He never said that. What is it between us, that's what you said! He never said you were a fairy. For Christ's sake! Will you just leave it alone? He spoke. You can't blame Paul, he's had enough. You act like you're not interested anymore. I'm not. Bollocks. I'm not gonna play in a rock and roll band for the rest of me life. Paul is, you are. It's what you want. Found something better, have you? I'll let you know. I'm going to find out. Calls for a drink, eh? I've gotta go, mate. Stu, she's just a girl. All right, she's quite a girl, she's got a bit of je ne sais fucking quoi. She swept you off your feet. At the end of the day she's just another shag. She's having a bit of fun with ya. She's a collector, she hasn't finished with you yet. She'll get bored. You don't know her. She'll get tired and then she'll throw you back where you came from. You don't know me very well either. She'll get rid of you, she'll finish with you like she did to Klaus. She's gonna do it to you, too! She will! Fuck you! She'll fucking do it to you! Oh, fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you. He knows War and Peace word by word. The whole thing? The whole thing in Russian. My advice, take two. What can I say? You don't need to say anything. Calls for a drink. You can do it. Stuart! Klaus! This has happened to you how many times? I don't know. A couple. I'm in a band. We play eight days a week. It can give you a headache. Hmm. A blow to the head. You have had such a blow? Who hasn't? Hmm. It was the pills, the speed. I'll lay off the speed. Yeah, do so, Mr. Sutcliffe. And also do this: Slow down. Take your time. Life is long. You must not be in too much of a hurry. Well? What did he say? You want the truth? Please. He said I should find a nice German girl and ask her to marry me. That's absurd. I think I've got something to offer. Got a long way to go, I know that. I'm not trying to pass meself off as something I'm not. But I want to be a painter. I want the chance.

John wants the world. That's it. - Yes! - Yeah! She wants babies. I know. She thinks you're going to marry her. I am. She's lucky. Do you think so? Yuck. It's rum. That's what sailors drink. I'm a sailor. I'm the son of a sailor. I'm the son of a sailor's son. Tell me something, John Lennon. When you are rich and famous, when you are number one, when your name is in lights and everybody wants to be your friend, when somebody asks you do you remember Astrid in Hamburg, what will you say? I'll say she was the girl I always wanted. The girl of me dreams. Like Brigitte Bardot with better manners. I might have fallen in love with her, but she fell in love with me best friend and that was the end of that. I love him, John. I do. Yeah. Don't we all? Paul can play bass. Paul can play bass a lot better than I can. He can sing a lot better, too. He's a bit flat, you know. You don't need me, John. You never did. Yeah, but it was our band, wasn't it? You and me, Stu. No. It was your band, yours and Paul's. We're going to be big, you know that, don't you? You'll miss it, Stu. You're going to kick yourself. We've got them by the throat, Stu. You're going to be here in Hamburg. It's what I want. It's where I want to be. There goes Stuart Sutcliffe. That's what they'll say. He could have been in the Beatles. There goes Stu Stutcliffe. He fell in love with a German girl. He could have been in the Beatles, but he never really learned how to play. ♪ Wait ♪ ♪ Oh yes wait a minute Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ Wait ♪ ♪ Wait Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ Mr. Postman look and see ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ Is there a letter in your bag for me ♪ ♪ Please please Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ I've been waiting a long long time ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ Since I heard from that girl of mine ♪ ♪ There must be some word today ♪ ♪ From my girlfriend so far away ♪ ♪ Please Mr. Postman look and see ♪ ♪ If there's a letter a letter for me ♪ ♪ I've been standing here waiting Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ So patiently ♪ ♪ For just a card or just a letter ♪ ♪ Saying she'll be coming home to me ♪ ♪ Please Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ Mr. Postman look and see ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ Is there a letter in your bag for me ♪ ♪ Please please Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ I've been waiting a long long time ♪ ♪ Oh yeah ♪ They were right. ♪ So many days you pass me by ♪ I give you back. ♪ See the tears standing in my eye ♪ ♪ You didn't stop to make me feel better ♪ But only for tonight. ♪ By leaving me a card or a letter ♪ ♪ Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ Mr. Postman look and see ♪ ♪ Is there a letter in your bag for me ♪ ♪ I've been waiting such a long time ♪ ♪ Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine ♪ ♪ You gotta wait a minute wait a minute oh yeah ♪ ♪ Mr. Postman wait a minute wait a minute ♪ ♪ Please Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ Wait a minute wait a minute Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ Deliver the letter the soon the better ♪ ♪ You gotta wait a minute wait a minute ♪ ♪ Please Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ Wait a minute wait a minute Mr. Postman ♪ ♪ Whoa yeah ♪ ♪ Wait a minute wait a minute Mr. Postman ♪ Thank you very much.
