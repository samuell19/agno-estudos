Life is the span that links the eternities. What has begun must have its end. The face of the city is a woman's face. It is changed by fashions, by necessity, and by a desire to grow and remain ever young. Everything changes but people. Sometimes they are better, sometimes they are worse. At all times, they are human, and life is the span that links the eternities. What has begun must have its end. What has ended must have its beginning. And though the path that man travels will vary, each according to his own fortune, for beggars and for kings alike, the first struggle is to be born. I'll just get my night things. Everything falls in the back. Someday I'm gonna tell Salvatore to fix it. Come on. You need some rest, darling. A little sleep, it's always good before. Your name. Tell me your name. We must have your name, for your child. Frances Kane. ...the forgiveness of sins and resurrection of the body, for life everlasting. Amen. We'll make out the birth certificate first, eh? Yes, Doctor. The living one first. What's his name? Francis Kane. It's only right. He'll have a hard enough life. Let him have this, which was his mother's. And so, the first struggle is over. A child is born. And it begins to grow into a man. It is now the spring of 1928, the year before the big crash. And the drought that had lain across the land for almost a decade had only succeeded in creating a greater thirst, a thirst that could only be quenched by walking in a back door. Go on, kid. Beat it. Don't bother the customers. Keep your fat pig paws off of me. Now look what you done, Frankie. Get out of here! Mr. Keough told me to come over here! Leave him alone, Tony. I sent for him. I want a shine. Okay, Mr. Fennelli. Anything you say, Mr. Fennelli. I'll take it. I can't give you a shine now, Mr. Fennelli. Why not? That's all the black wash I had. Get some. Sure. 50 or double your money you don't see the kid or the 5 again. You're on, Bert. I don't think the kid has ever seen that much money in his life. Probably not. Neither did I when I was his age. There you are. Wait here, baby. What's the date, Tony? May 31. You're wrong, Tony. It's the 1st of June. I haven't got it. Business has been bad. This is the second month you're behind, Tony. Business has been bad, I told ya. You tell me nothing. You just pay. Come on, baby. Hey, man, here he comes. I told you once before to keep off of this block! We don't allow Jews in here. I got just as much right here as anyone else, and I walk where I please. "I walk where I please. " In Jewbilee you do, not here! This is a good Christian neighborhood, and we don't want any of you kind of people dirtying it up. Come on, you guys. Let's get this Jew boy. Where do you think you're going, Jew boy? Come on, Frankie! Let's give this Jew boy his lumps! No, hold on. Hold on. You don't look like no Jew. Yeah. I'm a Jew. So what? And I'll take any one of you on. I'll take on any one of you! Let go. I said let go! Now, you heard what he said. He said any one of you. Now who's it gonna be? Well, come on. Come on. Who's it gonna be? Okay. I'll do it. Okay. Take him, Frankie. What you got? Come on, put 'em up. Give him some more! Get him, Frankie! Get him! He's had enough. Leave him alone. - Now, beat it or you'll get what he got. - Okay, Frankie boy. Now, go on. Beat it! - Okay. - Dirty Jew. - Bye-bye, crumb. - Bum. Thanks. For what? A sock in the kisser? No. For getting me off easy. Boy, I thought that gang was gonna kill me. They were just having a little fun, that's all. Some fun. You know, you better learn how to fight if you're gonna hang around this neighborhood, Jew boy. I got a name. Okay, okay. What's your name? Marty Cabell. - Marty, huh? - Yeah. You live around here? We just moved in the neighborhood. My father's in politics. We have to live here. You really better learn how to fight. You won't last a week. See you around. Hey, wait a minute. Listen, how about you teaching me how to box? Huh? Oh, no, no, no. Look, I haven't got time. I gotta work. Look, come over to my house tonight. Here's the address and the apartment number. Well... Please try, will ya? Yeah. Yeah, I'll try. I thought I told you to be back here early. Lay off the kid, Jimmy. He had to run an errand for me. I went over to the speak, but they told me you were over here. Here. Pay up, Bert. Can't beat the expert. Yeah, yeah. I should've known better. You probably rigged the whole thing. What took you so long, kid? I got in a little trouble. Frankie's a good boy. Best rack boy we ever had. Gonna put him on the route steady this summer. Ain't he kind of young for that? Gotta be real fast with the numbers. Oh, he's okay. I have him do all my figuring. Bright kid, huh? What's your name? Frankie. I mean your full name. Francis Kane. But you can call me Frankie, Mr. Fennelli. All my friends call me Frankie. So I'm your friend, am I? Finish it later. Yeah, sure. - Here's your change. - Keep it. I already made my profit on the deal. One profit on a deal's enough for anybody. That's my rule. Hey, thanks. He's an all right guy, huh, Mr. Keough? You can afford to be an all right guy when you got the whole neighborhood sewed up. All you gotta do is walk around and collect your dough. Where you been, boy? I was working. I don't know what I'm going to do with you, Francis. Straight for the devil's arms you're headed. Oh, I was just trying to make a few extra bucks, that's all. Why, Frankie? Why? We give you everything you need. Sure, you do. Everything but one thing. Something that's mine that never belonged to nobody else before. Ah, I don't know. It's like I was a prisoner here. Everything's great as long as I do what I'm told. God help us. Can't I make you understand we're only trying to make it good for you? If you want to make it good for me, just leave me alone, huh? Let me do something for myself just once. Yes? Is, uh... Is Marty in? Come in. Marty, there's a boy here to see you. - Hi. - Hi. Julie, this is Frankie. He's gonna teach me how to box. Hello. This is Julie. She works for us. Hey, I got a pair of gloves so you can teach me right. I'll teach you, but I gotta get out of here early. I haven't got much time tonight. I can't lace it. Here, I'll help you. Okay, push. There we go. Straighten your fingers out. Not too tight, huh? All right? Thanks. Here. Push. Okay. Well, they're new. Well, who's gonna lace yours? Hey, Julie, lace up Frankie's gloves. Sure, I'll be glad to. Thanks. Can I watch? Well, sure. If it's okay with Marty. Yeah, sure. Then we can get started. Now, Julie, you better go over by the wall out of the way. - Okay. - Okay. Now, the way you stand, that's the most important thing. Here. That's it. No, no. Up like this. Hips straight. All right. Now, you jab with the left. Jab with the left. Come on. That's it. Then follow through with the right. Okay. Come on, now, you try and hit me. Hey, I don't want to hurt ya. That's my lookout. Come on, now. Okay. That's good. That's it. Open, you're open. Now, keep it... Don't swing wild. Keep your elbows in. That's it. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Okay, come on. You're open. All right, keep your punches in, now. Don't swing wild. I'm sorry, Marty. It's nothing. Wow. You better put some ice on that or you're gonna have a beaut of a shiner. Yeah. I'll get some. You didn't have to do that. - Do what? - Hit him so hard. You said you were gonna teach him, not hurt him. It was an accident, wasn't it? Well, you could've been more careful. You know, Marty's not like one of us. Well, what am I supposed to do? Be a mind reader? Any baby could've ducked that punch. Besides, it's the only way he's gonna learn. Here, you better let me help you. Now pull your hands out. Pretty strong, aren't you? I don't know. I never thought much about it. You are strong. You know, it's not as easy as I thought. I'm sorry, kid. That's okay, it was an accident. It's getting late. I better get out of here. Hey, we'll try again tomorrow, huh? Yeah, okay. Tomorrow. See you around, huh? Okay. I'm sorry about what I said. Oh, that's okay. Forget it. Frankie, are you gonna come back? Well, sure. Marty and me are friends now. I'm glad. Yeah? Why are you glad? Marty hasn't got any friends. I think he needs a friend like you. Is that the only reason? I haven't got any friends, either. A girl like me, well, there just aren't any, that's all. Now we're friends, huh, Julie? I hope so. Good night, Frankie. Good night, Julie. Yes. Come in. Mrs. Cozzolina. It's good of you to come and see an old friend. Have you come to talk about your grandson Peter? He's a good boy. No, Brother, it's not about Peter. It's something more serious. Oh, we made a mistake. A terrible mistake. A mistake? About what? Francis Kane. This suitcase belonged to the mother. His mother? She had him when she came over to my house, so I put it in back of the closet, and it fell. And I didn't bother because I didn't remember no more. Until today. That Peter, he ripped the wall, and I found it. I don't see what mistake we could've made. We brought him up a good Catholic boy. Open the suitcase. Francis Kane. Yes. He's a Jew. This is wonderful, just wonderful. You know, I've never been on a picnic before. Hey, I'm hungry. I've got sandwiches. Here. Gee, it's too bad Marty couldn't come, huh? Well, he had to go someplace with his father. You got a pickle? His father really runs him, doesn't he? Yes, but I like him. He's a nice boy. Yeah. You should have seen him the first day I met him. He told me about that gang, and they're really a mean bunch. Oh, they're all right. Anyway, I wouldn't want to be in his position, especially in this neighborhood, for all the money in the world. Who do you want to be like? I mean, what do you want to do later? I want to be a big man, just like Silk Fennelli. Silk Fennelli, who's he? He's the boss in our neighborhood. Runs everything. He's a gangster, isn't he? So what? He's my friend. Besides, Keough said I could run bets for him this summer. Frankie, you don't have to. Marty was telling his father that he wants you to go to the country with him. Oh, I can't, Julie. I promised. Anyway, I want to buy a suit, a suit that nobody ever wore before me. What are you going to do? I don't know. Once I wanted to be a singer. They used to say I had a real nice voice in school, but... But what? My father ran away, and there's four small kids at home, so I had to quit school and get a job. They have to eat, too, you know. You could have found a better job than being a maid. You sure? You know, there's not many jobs open for a girl like me. That doesn't make any difference. Whatever we do from now on we're going to do together. The bologna's lying on my nose. I just came from the meeting. It's no use. We can't keep him. We're sending him away on Monday. But, Father, it makes... We have nothing to do with it, Bernard. It's the law. It's the will of God. So it may be. But, Father, you will have to help me understand it. It was like he was my son. Yes, I know. I know. Hi. Oh. How'd you make out, kid? Pretty good. There's 51.50 there. Here. Only two guys hit. One for 8.40 and the other for 15 bucks. Well, here's your cut. 11.25. Oh, thanks. Not bad for your first day's work, eh, kid? Sure beats shining shoes. Close up for an hour, and buy us both a sandwich and beer over at Tony's. Celebrate the kid's new job. - Okay. - Sure. Aren't you forgetting something, Jimmy? Oh, yeah, yeah. It's the first of July. Still got the money in your hand, Jimmy. Find it tough letting go? Hey, Mr. Keough, you dropped the... Beat it, kid. Beat it and keep your mouth shut. Take this. Take this money. Bring it to me in the hospital. Now beat it before the cops get here. Julie. - Frankie. - Close the door. What happened to you? They just... They just shot my boss and Fennelli. - They who? - Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I didn't bother to look. I just got out of there. Poor kid, you look so frightened. No, I'm not. I've got to get out of this shirt. It's all blood. Did anyone see you? They were after Fennelli, not me. I'll be all right as long as I keep my trap shut. Julie, I got to get out of here. Look, I'll get you one of Marty's shirts. You don't have to rush. Marty and his folks are out to dinner. Where'd you get that money? It's not mine, it's Fennelli's. Listen, I got to get it back to him later. Figure out a place to stash this stuff. You're not going to leave it there. Why not? You're not running away, are you? Do you trust me with all that money, Frankie? Yeah. Yeah, I do. You're the only person in the world I can trust, Julie. I'm sorry I'm late again. It doesn't matter, Francis. Sit down. Sure. I don't know how to tell you this, Francis. But many years ago, when I brought you here to this place in my own arms, I made a mistake. Mistake, what do you mean? I thought I'd better be telling you about it tonight because tomorrow, I'd only find another excuse not to tell you. Tell me what? You see this Bible? Yeah. It was your mother's. Where'd you get it? Oh, it's been so many years. Too many years. That's our mistake. It's been in the back of Mrs. Cozzolina's closet all this time. There must be some mistake. This Bible is in Jewish. Hebrew, Francis, not Jewish. What difference does it... Are you trying to tell me I'm a Jew? Yes, Francis. But I can't be. L... I don't feel like a Jew. All men feel the same, no matter what their religion, Francis. I don't believe you. It's a trick. No, it's no trick. And I had to tell you tonight, for on Monday you're leaving here for another place. It is a trick. You're just trying to get rid of me. Well, I won't go. You have no choice, Francis. We have no choice. You've got to go. You can't send me to another orphanage. I'm not a Jew, and I never will be a Jew. I'll run away before I let you make one out of me. Julie? What are you doing back here? They're trying to send me to another orphanage, and I won't go. Oh, Frankie, don't be foolish. You can't run away. They'll only find you and send you back. Not where I'm going because I'm not coming back, not until they leave me alone. You got a pencil? In the drawer there. Now, watch the papers. When you find out where Fennelli is, bring him this. I took 20 bucks. I left a marker for it. Tell him I'll pay him back as soon as I can. L... I guess I'd better go now, Julie. Is that all, Frankie? Yeah, that's all. I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too, Julie. Will you write to me? Sure, sure. I'll write to you. - Don't say it if you don't mean it. - I mean it. I wish you wouldn't go. You're still such a kid. Hey, Frankie. He's running away. You in any trouble, Frank? No, I-I'm not in any trouble. L... I just got to get out of here, that's all. Well, wait, I'll come out with you. I'll make him wait downstairs. Hey, Frankie. You sure you want to go? Yeah. Yeah, I couldn't go to another orphanage, Marty. Yeah, I guess so. Good luck, Frank. Remember, now. Keep your left up, huh? - Bye, Frankie. - Bye, Julie. Please be careful, Frankie. Don't forget me, please don't. Don't forget to write! Please don't forget me, Frankie. I'll never see him again, never. He'll be back. He will. Mr. Fennelli? Let her in. I have something for you. Where'd you get this? Frankie Kane told me to give it to you before he left. Where'd he go? I don't know. He just ran away. Dumb kid. He didn't have to do that. Nobody was looking for him. It wasn't that. Wait a minute. What's your name? Julie. Well, at least give me a chance to thank you properly. When I get out of here, give me a call at my office. Julie met a man, Silk Fennelli. He paid for her singing lessons. Oh, baby When the lights are low I miss you so Oh, baby Oh, baby Won't you please, please call Oh, baby I need you so Too many days have gone by Without a word from you Marty went off to college to become a lawyer, then to a position in the district attorney's office that his father obtained for him. No one could know what the years between had been for Frankie... those years between that turned him gray and bitter before his time. Maybe if Frankie ever got a job, if he really ever had a chance, things might have been different for him. But there was a Depression and a crying hunger in the land that brought him to the soup kitchen, where he stood in line for a crust of bread... and then to a cold hallway, where he slept at night with his shoes as a pillow tied around his neck so they would not be stolen, and the police to make sure he would not oversleep. And there was the W.P.A., where at least for one day a month he could be equal to other men and hold up his head while he labored, and a trash can fire, at which he could warm his freezing hands, while destiny, in the shape of a dump truck moving toward him, had already begun to redirect his life. Almost seven years have passed. It is winter, 1935. And the separate paths that each have followed begin to converge like the parallels that meet on the horizon. Going back to your office, Mr. Cabell? Yeah, yeah. You know, I... I thought working in the district attorney's office was going to be big-time stuff. I never thought I'd spend half my time checking statements in Belleview. Well, that's the way it goes. What happened to him? You're lucky this time. He's not one of your customers. Just some bum shoveling rubble. A truck backed into him. He didn't even have sense enough to get out of the way. Okay, let's take a look at him now. Frankie. You know him? Yeah. He was my best friend once. In that case, we'd better get some action around here. Glucose solution. Frankie. Frank. It's me, Marty. Hey. How you doing, fella? I'm okay. Will you... Will you crank up that thing there? Yeah, sure. Hey, you know, they got a special delivery truck for cases like yours. You know, you could have written. There was nothing to write about. Well, you could've let me know how you were making out. Now you know. I might have been able to help. I had enough of charity, Marty. L... When do they let me out of this place? In about a week. You're pretty run-down. Oh, I can't wait a week. L... I got to get some dough together. They seem to think it's more important that you eat. They figure you hadn't eaten in about a week. Guess that's one of the things you need dough for. Don't you want to see Julie? No. She's singing in a nightclub now. Hey, you know, I understand she's pretty good. Last time I saw her, she asked about you. Look, it's no use, kid. You can't turn back the clock. Just get them to get me out of here, will you? And forget you ever saw me. And what are you going to do? Go back on the bum again? No. No, I'm through being a bum. I'm going to go see a guy about a job. A guy who won't ask me where I've been or what I've been doing or what kind of education I got. Then you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get me 20 bucks together and go pay a marker. Then everything will be all right. 20 bucks. You're a big man. That's all it'll take. Then be my guest, big shot. 20 dollars. Seven years had gone and he had returned to their beginning, and there was 20 dollars. Sit down, kid. You took a long time getting here. Where you been keeping yourself? Been out in the woods. It's the first time I've been back and the first time I got 20 bucks together all at one time. Run out and buy yourself some decent clothes. Get yourself a real square meal under your belt. Not looking for any handouts. Who's giving you a handout? I just don't want one of my boys looking like a bum. She's on her way down, Mr. Fennelli. Okay, Sam. Next stop, the Jackpot Club on 52nd, Frankie. Thanks for picking me up, Silk. It's okay, baby. Just wanted you to see an old friend of ours who popped into town. An old friend, who? You remember Frankie. Frankie. Yeah, Frankie Kane. Frankie's back? Where is he, Silk? Hey, Frankie, say hello to your old friend. Hello, Julie. Hello, Frankie. Hey, this is a fine way for a couple of old buddies to act. Aren't you even going to ask each other anything? How have you been? Fine. You? I-I've been all right. Silk... Mr. Fennelli gave me a job right after I brought that money back to him. The money you left with me. He's been very nice, paid for singing lessons... Yeah. I know. Wait here, kid. Frankie's changed. He's changed in a lot of ways. We all have. I hope so. I wouldn't like it if you hadn't. What do you mean? You know what I mean. I don't want any problems with you two. Don't worry, Silk. You're not going to lose your investment. You know how I feel about you, baby. I know exactly how you feel about me, Silk. Just stay away from him. Nice kid, Julie. Yeah. I was a little worried at how she'd feel to see you again. You don't have to worry, Silk. That's what she told me. When I buy somebody, I keep 'em. Nobody buys people. You know what I'm talking about. You just do as you're told, and we'll get along fine. Okay. When we get back to the office, put the car in the garage, Frankie, and come on up. Fats Crown's there. Needs a little straightening out. Yes, Master. That's the way I like to hear you talk. Get your crummy feet off my desk. Listen, Fats, how many times do I have to warn you to keep your boys out of my territory? I told my boys to bring you over here, and now I'm going to teach you a lesson. Not this time you won't, Silk. This time, I came to teach you a lesson. Well, maybe I was a little bit hasty, Fats. We should... We should talk this over. There's no sense in getting upset over a little thing like this. That's right, Silk, no sense at all. Don't worry, Silk. Everything will work out. Sure, everything's going to work out. Just making sure. You want me to shoot him in the back, Silk? Or shall I wait for him to turn around? All right, boys. Put the rods on the table. You know, Silk? I don't know how you ever managed to get along without me. Maybe what Frankie said was true. Certainly during the next few years, he had to render unto Caesar the things that were Fennelli's. There was violence and destruction and vengeance borne of vengeance. And inside of Frankie there was a growing disgust with the cycle of stupidity. And more important, there was also in him a secret and gnawing ambition. It's going to have to stop, Silk. I've been back three years, and it's like I never went away. Sooner or later, the people are going to have enough. Then we'll all be out of business. They got enough wars going on without our help. All right, so how are we going to stop it? We can't just let anybody come into our territory and cut themselves a slice. Call the boys together. Have a meeting. Must be as tired of fighting as we are. Okay, I'll try. Suppose they won't listen. They'll listen. We're making the town too hot for ourselves. If we keep it up, we're all going to be out of business. We got to organize, cut out this fightin' between ourselves. Okay? Okay. But how we gonna it? It's simple. We appoint one guy as commissioner, like in baseball. It'll be his job to keep everybody in line. Right, Frankie? Right. That all sounds pretty good, Silk, but who's going to make me stay in my own territory if I feel like expanding? You? No. There ain't one of you guys can make me do it. That gun, Madigan. That's what we got to cut out. You got to listen to reason. Who's going to make me? I am. Pick up your gun, Madigan. You want to argue? I said pick up your gun. All right. The way I see it, I'm the only guy you can trust. I don't have any territory to protect, and I don't want any of yours. Why, you young punk. What makes you think that you're big enough to handle the job? Anybody here say no? Frankie had organized things well... too well. He took his organization across the river to New Jersey, where the law could not reach him, and began to climb the long, dark path from obscurity to the front pages of every newspaper in the country. It was only $20 that he had wanted, then it became 20,000, and then 20 million. And his fingers reached into the pocket of everyone that liked a game of chance, from the racetracks of the country to the friendly game in the back room. The surface quiet was deceptive. And Frankie could not, or would not, see the bondage he had placed on many people. He was too busy running a business. Then one day, the governor and the mayor called a press conference. They declared war on Frank Kane. And so gentlemen, your city and the state, even the country, is in danger of falling into the power and hands of one man. That is why I have called this emergency meeting with your mayor, your police commissioner, your district attorney. Who is this man, Mr. Governor? One man who has so organized gambling as a business in just a few years he's been in power that it is vitally affecting our entire economic welfare, whether we gamble or not. He has involved many of our citizens in economic bondage, forcing them into debt to small and large usurers and bookmakers. This man must be stopped. His name is Frank Kane. It is our sworn duty to put him behind bars. And to that end, we are appointing a special prosecutor. He will have but one function... to get Frank Kane. Who's the prosecutor going to be? The special prosecutor will be a young man who has already made a name for himself as a vigorous assistant to the district attorney, Martin Cabell. How many tablets in a big bottle of aspirin? I think 100. Order me a hundred. Yes, sir, 100 tablets. No, no, no. 100 bottles. That's 10,000 tablets. That's right, dear. And send them all to Martin Cabell with my compliments. Get me Ta... Get me an outside line. Give me TAlmadge 7 2082 in New Jersey. Frank Kane Enterprises. May I speak to Mr. Kane? Who is calling, please? Just tell him... Just tell him Marty. Hello? Hello, Frankie. This is Marty. Yeah, I know. I want to see you, Frankie. I want to talk to you. Yeah, I read that in the papers. I'm serious, Frank. I want to see you alone. Anyplace you say. Why don't you, uh... Why don't you come over to my office? I can't do that, Frank, any more than you can come to mine. Don't you know someplace we can meet? You know the roadside rest on the other side of the George Washington Bridge? Well, I can find it. I'll meet you there at, uh... at 4:00. See you then, Frank. Hello, Counselor. What can I do for you? I didn't come here to see what you can do for me, Frank. I came to see what I can do for you. You want to make a deal? No deal, Frank. You know I wouldn't do that. Well, then, uh, what did you come for? To talk you into giving yourself up. It would be the best thing for you. Then when this is over, you can live your own life. I am living my own life. And besides, I, um... Are you sure it's the best thing I can do? Or the best thing that I can do for you? We were friends, Frank. There are certain things we owe each other, and there's certain things that must be paid. Yeah, we were friends once. But we're not children anymore. Can I make you understand all I'm trying to do is help? Oh, I understand. Now, why don't you just stick to your business and leave me alone? I feel a responsibility towards you. You don't owe me anything. As a matter of fact, it's me that owes you. You know, without that 20 bucks, I might never have made it. I'm sorry I ever gave it to you. From now on, be careful who you lend money to. Good luck, Counselor. The heat's really on, Frankie. I mean it. Marty Cabell saw the governor. They're going after us first since they can't get to you in Jersey. Look, we got to do something. The boys are worried. You too, huh, Silk? Me, too. What do you want me to do, hold your hand? Can't you get to Marty Cabell in some way? He must have a body buried somewhere. His old man's a politician. No, he's clean. His whole family's clean. There must be some way to stop him. Oh, yeah, there is. I'll tell you how. I cross that river, walk into his office, and say, "Here, boys, here I am. " You know we don't mean that, Frankie. How do I know what you guys mean? All I know is you come out here crying to me every time something goes wrong. But, Frankie... Don't "but" me, Silk. Can't you guy... Don't you guys see what they're trying to do? They'll ride one of you around until he cracks wide open. Then they'll have all of us. Look, Frankie... Look, just keep your mouth shut and sit tight. I've made arrangements to cover every guy that's picked up. I got a half a million dollars' worth of bail bonds working in that city. They won't hold a guy any longer than it takes him to get to a phone. I'm not forgetting Silk that you once wanted this little organization all to yourself. And I got a good memory. And don't you forget, Frankie, I picked you up off the bum and gave you your first chance. I'm not forgetting. It's the reason I'm being so polite. Silk, I didn't expect you so late. Just stopped by for a drink on the way to the office. I just came from Frankie. That old boyfriend of yours must be nuts. What did he do now? Nothing, that's the trouble. He's hotter than a firecracker, and he's just sitting there waiting to be taken. Well, what should he do? I don't know. But if I were him, I'd get out of the country. You know, somebody ought to talk to him, get some sense into that thick skull. What do you mean? You know what I mean. He doesn't listen. I'm just worried he's going to get caught. Are you, Silk? Well, sure I am. You know I've always liked Frankie. We've had our arguments, but hasn't everybody? Look, I've got an appointment. I'll be back to pick you up in about an hour. Oh, honey, don't bother. I've got some shopping to do. Okay, baby. I'll see you at the club then, later on. Yeah. There's a lady outside waiting to see you. She give a name? She said you knew her. Her name is Julie. Send her in. Hello, Frankie. Hello, Julie. Well, aren't you going to ask me to sit down? Sure. Sure, sit down. It's been a long time. Yeah, long time. Don't you ever come into town anymore? You know I can't do that. They're just waiting for me to show up. I don't mean now, Frankie. I mean a long time now, before this. I've been busy. Yes, I know. I've been listening to Silk. He send you out here? Oh, Frankie, you know better than that. What did you come out for? To see you. I've been worried about you. I'm okay. Are you? You're really okay with the whole world running after you like mad? They got to catch me first. Still running. When are you going to stop, when you're dead? Oh, look, these things blow over, they always do. When it does, things will be back to normal again. Not this time. You don't hear what I hear. It's not going to blow over, not this... Okay, I get the message. Now, beat it. I only wanted to help you. Listen, baby. When I need help, I'll know better than to ask Fennelli's girl for it. I have never been anybody's girl but yours, Frankie. Never love a stranger Never let him catch your eye Hide your heart and look away 'Till he passes by Once I loved a stranger Give me a double Scotch. Just his touch would make me thrill And though we kissed a thousand times We were strangers still Like two lonely... Silk, look. Middle of the bar, the guy standing there. You know where the phone is? Yeah, Silk. Dial the operator and call the cops. - You understand? - Yeah. And make it fast. I'll try to stall him. Too alone to be together So if you meet a stranger What are you doing in town? I needed some air. Another drink. - Double Scotch, sir? - Yeah. Why didn't you let me know you were coming? I might have arranged something. I'll bet. Stop by the table. A couple of the boys are here. In a minute. He'll never love a stranger For strangers Always part We're worried, Frankie. You got nothing to worry about. They hear Moishe wants to quit. It's about time. He's an old man. Maybe too old for this business. You gonna let him, Frankie? Yeah, if he wants to, he can. He's entitled. You sure you're not going soft on him because he's a Jew? What's that got to do with it? You didn't run away from that school when you were a kid because you were hot. You're looking for trouble, Silk. Okay, Frankie, okay. But what if he talks? Moishe won't talk. Where's Julie's dressing room? It's right through the curtains, there. Go ahead. She'd like to see you. It's the first door. - You call? - Yeah. Okay, what are we waiting for? Let's get out of here. Come in. Frankie, what are you doing here? I came to see you. Well, you've got to get out. Someone will recognize you. Take it easy, Julie. I just came to tell you I was sorry. Oh, it's been a long time. You'd better go. Frankie, you mustn't stay here. I'll go with you. This place is full of cops. Is there another way out of here? The back, my car's around the corner. I'm not going to let you take any more chances. Can I get you a drink? Yeah. What are you smiling about? Oh, I was just thinking. Things haven't changed too much, have they, Julie? Except this time, I... I don't have blood on my shirt. In the bathroom. Leave the door open so you can hear if there's any trouble. Julie. Just a minute. I'll tell him that I'm getting ready for bed. I'm coming. Just a minute. What took you so long? I was just taking off my make-up. Where's Frankie? He's gone. He's gone? The doorman didn't see him leave. Well, maybe he went out the back way. He said he was in a hurry. I'll bet. I'll hang this up for you. Why don't you look in the bathroom? Maybe he's in there. You left the club in such a rush, I was wondering. Wondering what? About you and Frankie. You were so chummy. You jealous? A little. Staying? I can't, there's too much to do. The cops know that Frankie came to town. I got to find him before they do. What for? What can you do? If they grab him, he'll be sure it was me that tipped them. Did you? What kind of a fool do you think I am, baby? I got enough troubles. Oh, Frankie. Frankie, I'm frightened. Don't be. Look, Julie, baby, baby. Listen to me. Everything's going to be all right. But they're after you. Everybody's after you. You'll never be able to get away. Oh, Frankie, I missed you so much. When you went away, I thought I'd never see you again. I told you I'd be back. But you never wrote. Look, that's over now. I'm back, and I'm not running away anymore. You'll never lose me, Julie. Do you mean that? You really mean that, after everything that's happened? This time it's for keeps. What time is it? Almost 12:00. Yes, sir? Give me TAlmadge 7 2082 in New Jersey. You were sleeping like a baby. I hated to wake you. I was tired. Never would have guessed it. Hello. Yes, Mr. Kane. I want to speak to Marty Cabell's office in New York. And loop me in through the switchboard, understand? Yes, sir. Yeah. Mr. Kane is calling you. Check that call. He might still be in the city. Yes, sir. And listen, I'll keep him on the line while you check. All right, put him on. Hello, Kane, what do you want? Your boys are gonna have to do better than they did last night. That is, if you ever expect to get anywhere. Why don't you come in and give yourself up? Frankie, you know we're going to get you sooner or later. You want to make a deal? No deal. It's a Jersey call, all right. I said no deal, Frank, understand? Notify all the precincts. Tell them to call off their men. He's back in Jersey. I'd better call Moishe and have him pick me up in a half hour. That will give Marty just enough time to call the watchdogs off. Well, will you please call me when you get home? I worry about you. Oh, Julie. I don't have to spend the rest of my life telling you not to worry, do I? Not if you stay where I can keep my eyes on you. Soon, baby. Soon. Give me a Scotch. What are you having, Moishe? Ginger ale. Heart. When did that happen? Eh, I can't take this anymore, Frankie. All this excitement, I'm getting too old for it. You know you'd miss it. I'll go somewhere with my wife and spend a few quiet years. I mean it, Frankie, I want to quit. You know how the boys would feel about it. How? They'd say the old Jew was the first one to run out. And what do you say? Think Jews are different from anybody else? They don't get old and tired? No, I don't care about that. I always wondered about you, Frankie. I never could figure you out. Are you one of us? Some people think so. But that doesn't matter. - You know what else they'll say? - What? That you're yellow and ready to squeal. Moishe Moskowitz never squealed on anybody in his whole life, and he ain't gonna start at the age of 62. Okay, Moishe. You can quit. Thanks, Frankie. All right, get out of town by the end of the week. Don't let anybody know you're leaving. I don't want the boys to know until I tell 'em. I'll tell 'em after you've gone. Understand? Yes, Frankie. I understand. Well, I guess that's that. I'm gonna draw a check for 10% of the pool for you. I think you deserve it, Moishe. Take some advice from an old man, Frankie. Get out of this while you can. You're a good boy, and smart, too. Not many of us get the chance to quit while we're still ahead. We generally go while we're young. And sudden. And the longer we last, the tougher it becomes for us to get out. We get greedy and we wind up settling for a bullet. If it was anybody else but you, I couldn't do what I'm doing now. Don't let anyone stop you from quitting or pay you off with lead. Don't worry about me, Moishe. You just sneak out of town quiet like I told you. Come on. There it is. The prosecutor and the governor want Kane. If we keep on at this fight the way Kane wants, we're all gonna end up broke or in the can before it's through. But the way I see it, it's him or us. It's up to us now. Either we get Kane or the law's gonna take us all over. That's a big idea, but who's gonna do it? I'm gonna bring in some torpedoes. No, I'm against it. No more killings. Kane always treated us straight. He kept every promise. We're all better off for doing what he told us. I say no. You're getting old and yellow, Moishe. Or is it maybe because you wanna quit and he gave you the okay? I know he paid off your share of the pool yesterday. That doesn't make any difference. Remember what it was like before Kane? We were afraid to walk into the daylight in case we should walk into a bullet. Is that what you want to go back to? Ah, go and get yourselves killed if you want to. I'm going home. You ain't going no place. Francis, how are you, my boy? I thought of you often. Couldn't you leave well enough alone? Don't blame the child, Francis. It was I who insisted that she bring me here. I wanted to... I know what you wanted. To tell me what to do. Well, you can't. I'm not a kid anymore. It's not as if you can rush me off to another orphanage just because somebody said I didn't belong. Frankie, it isn't like that at all. That goes for you, too, Julie. Either take me as I am or not at all. Francis, we love you. We only meant what's good for you. That's what you always said. Like the time you told me I was a Jew. You couldn't wait to get me out of there, could you? You had to rush me off like I was a leper. It was the law, Francis. We wanted to keep you, but the law said we couldn't. And now, this thing you're mixed up in, it's like you're running away all over again. You've got to make amends, Francis, so that you can enjoy your life. All right, all right, Brother Bernard. Enough lectures. Now, nobody was there to tell me what to do when I was hungry and shoveling dirt. And nobody's gonna tell me what to do now that I got what I want. I think you'd better go. I brought this with me. You threw it on the floor the last time I saw you. All right, Frankie, I won't lecture you anymore. I think you ought to keep this. It was your mother's. It was the only thing she left you. Francis, it's no crime being a Jew. But there is a crime in the way you're living. My religion's got nothing to do with it. Being a Jew doesn't guarantee me getting into heaven any more than you can. The only thing that matters to me now is what I want and what I'm gonna get. I love you, Frankie. I always have. But I can't stay when you're like this. But you could with Fennelli while I was gone. That was all right, huh? I've made mistakes, too, but I never loved him. It was all over the day I saw you in the car, and he knew it. Price! Brother Bernard left, but I came back. What for? I couldn't leave you, Frankie. Price. That your friend in there? What are we gonna do with the dame? What else can we do? We've gotta take her with us. Wait. Wait a minute. Why don't you let her go? She didn't have anything to do with this. Move. Oh, wait. Look, we can make a deal. I got plenty of money. Just let her go. I only work for one boss at a time. On your way. Where we going? We're going to town. Hello, boss? This is Flix. I got him here. Yeah. He wasn't alone. A broad was with him. How do I know what they were doing? Sure, I brought her along. I couldn't leave her there. No, it don't bother me. It'll cost you extra. Piece work is always expensive. Okay, I'll meet you at the garage later. You, come here. A man by the name of Marty Cabell's at that number. That's his private number. Call him up. Tell him you want to see him alone first. You're ready to come in. I'll be right behind you, listening. One wrong word and you don't put down that phone. You're dead. Yeah? Hello, Marty. This is Frankie. What do you want? I'm ready to come in. But first I gotta see you right away. I'm at, uh... I'm at 121 West 89th street. Apartment A. Okay, I'll be there in a half an hour. Alone. I'll be alone. What's the pitch? You're knocking off the law, big shot. The frame's too rough. You'd never get away with it. Won't make any difference to you. You'll be dead, too. So will the dame. You're a busy little beaver, aren't you? Three in one night, huh? Four. Four? Who's the other one? Some old Jew partner of yours, name of Moishe. They got him in the 12th Avenue Garage. He gets his just as soon as we're through here. You, get out to the car. Move it up the block. - I don't want the law to get suspicious. - But I might not make it back in time. You don't have to. Just keep your eyes peeled. I can handle things here. You, take her in there. - Okay. - Keep her quiet. Julie. Julie, I... I'm sorry. Don't be. I always told you I was your girl. Come on. Frankie, open up. It's me, Marty. Talk to him. Come in. I'm glad you called. You know, it's about time you came... I should've known better. Look, kid. I didn't, honest. Get in there. Okay, boys, you can toss for it first. I can make it for more dough than you ever saw. I've told you before. One boss at a time. I can do better than that. I can pay you off. For him. Boys, don't squabble. You, get over there. Why don't you think about that money, Flix. Just think about it. One of the big shots. Look out! You get the point, Marty? You lead with your left and follow through with a right cross to the jaw. Okay, Frank. Now what's it all about? They were gonna kill you and pin it on me. I don't believe you. I'm gonna call the police. It's the truth. I know. They were gonna kill me, too. Why? Marty, don't be a jerk, will ya? Things would be just great for Fennelli with you and me out of the way. No witnesses. Where do you think you're going? Listen to me. They got Moishe. If you don't let me go, they'll kill him. Please, Marty. I'll come back. I promise. Marty, he saved your life. Okay. - I'll go with you. - No. Look, you stay here with her. This is something I gotta do myself. I'll meet you at Julie's place in an hour. Take my car. It's the gray Ford outside. Frankie, be careful. I'll be careful, baby. I got a lot to be careful for. We got a wedding to go to, remember? Don't worry about him. He'll be all right. He won't. I know he won't. I know I'll never see him again. You said that once before, remember? You were wrong then. Well, this time I know. If you were so frightened, why did you let me let him go? I had to. Don't you see, Marty? He had to go. It was the only way he could make up for what he did. It was the only thing he could pay back. Loyalty. Keep dealing. We'll wait here till the boss gets here. That's orders. Yeah? What if Kane gets here first? Kane's got enough troubles of his own. Come on, you guys. Pick up your hands. Take it easy, Pop. Where you're going, you don't need dough. I don't care. I just feel lucky. I'll finish the hand for you, Moishe. Don't touch it. Not if you like living. Pick up their guns, Moishe. I was wondering when you'd get here, Frankie. I was a little delayed. Take the gun, Flix. Go on, go on. Don't be bashful. Take it. All right, on your feet, steamboat. You know, you're nothing without a gun. Nothing! Pick him up. Put him in that chair. Sit down. Well, you can go home now, Moishe. Nobody's gonna bother you anymore. What are you gonna do, Frankie? Finish your hand for you. Here's your winnings, Moishe. Now beat it. How long you been working for Fennelli? Never heard of the guy. Well, you're gonna wish you hadn't when this is over. The rivers are just full of guys who couldn't deliver for him. He, uh... He has a habit of getting rid of failures. That way, it doesn't rub off on him. All right. Don't anybody move. You let him get away. How? How'd you do it? I oughta take care of you right now. Where's the old man? Where's Moishe? He had to leave town, Silk. I thought I'd sit in for him. So you had to be a big shot, huh? You weren't satisfied with things the way they were. No, Frankie. No. You ain't got it straight. I'm your friend, remember? Gave you your first break. That's why you sent these hoods after me, because you were my friend, huh? No, that ain't true. These guys came from out of town. I heard about it. Don't con me, Silk. You know, when I was a kid, I used to think you were a big man. A right guy. How wrong I was. I guess I've been wrong all the way down the line. You know what I mean, don't you, Silk? Don't, Frankie. Don't. All right, you can go home now, boys. The party's over. Yeah, Frankie. It's all over. Thanks. We're even. He would've hit me next. Julie. Life is the span that links the eternities.
