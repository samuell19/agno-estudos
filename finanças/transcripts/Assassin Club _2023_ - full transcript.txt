Papochka? Papa! My kiss. Mmm. I told you to go straight from school, not all the way home. The roads are dangerous. But I, uh... Forget your dress, yes. Come. Mom's wedding ring. The only other woman who's ever accompanied me was your mother. You're old enough. I thought you should wear something of hers. Your uncle is downstairs. Wear your dress. Oh, my God. No! Run! Jonna! Jonna! Jonna. Go! Go! Find my brother! Jonna! This is Luka Lesek. He runs the largest human trafficking operation in all of Eastern Europe. It's women and children mostly. Used for forced labor, prostitution, and so on. And he runs the local police, of course, with kickbacks. Oh! And did I tell you? Just around the corner from where you are now, the most marvelous bar. I don't know what it's like now, but in the '90s, the most beautiful women in all of Eastern Europe. You love the sound of your own voice, don't you, old man? Oh, Morgan, dear boy, I'm just trying to help. You know, there's more to life than just... You know, I'd love to take the travel tips from an aging Lothario like yourself, but now really is not the time. All right, well, I'll leave you to it. And do me a favor. Try not to reduce the splendid city of Ljubljana to rubble. Hmm? I can't make any promises. Travel safe. "Nor dread nor hope attend a dying animal "A man awaits his end "Dreading and hoping all." Fuck! Where are you, bastard? Fuck. Come on. God! I'm glad I got you, Morgan. Tell me all about it. Well, to say it didn't go well would be a slight understatement. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Care to explain? Digging a bullet out of my body, but... Somebody shot me as I targeted Lesek. Oh, you know, a little flesh wound here and there, that's pretty much part of the job description. It felt calculated. Professional. I think there was a third party involved. Another shooter, eh? Well, thank God you're alive. What about Lesek? The guy who shot me shot him. Clearly not too selective. Right. Well, I'll dig around, and see what I can find out. Oh! Another thing. There's a new job, came in after you left. I think it's about time that we let some young guns take over, buddy. People who don't mind getting shot. No, no, no, no. Morgan, this isn't something we just pass up. This is big. So travel safe. We'll talk about it when you get back, all right? Oh, my day just got better. Are you hurt? Oh, no. Just tired. Really long day. I can hear it. Video, please. The signal's not that great, babe. I don't think I'm gonna get picture up. Come on. I miss seeing you. I don't sleep well when you're not here, and you know that. I think you tie that robe too tight. Do I? So maybe I should loosen it? That does feel better. Oh, sorry. Connection's bad. That's just cruel. Look, I got to, uh... I gotta go. You got a plane to catch? Good. Love you. I miss you. Oh, God. Merci. The attack culminated in the demise of Luka Lesek, leader of the Ljubljana crime ring. A rival syndicate? Perhaps. A personal feud? It's possible. But if you look at the autopsy reports, it will indicate otherwise. Clearly this was done by a trained hand. If we look at the wounds here, they're way too precise for what we expect from a typical gang war. The bullet's entry and its pinpoint accuracy would suggest an assassination. Personal belief, a contract killer with a military background. Our best option at the moment is to work with the local authorities. So, ladies and gentlemen, let's get to work. We got a lot to do. Thank you. What's been happening in the world today? Mmm. What are you up to? Some no good? Graffiti. Okay. Well, you gotta practice more, buddy. How about you? Come on. I know you're a good person. Buy him some water or something. Oh. There we go. There are still some good people in this world. Ciao. There she is. I missed you. It's so good to see you. Got you something though.Mmm. Mmm-hmm. Huh? This one looks like it's had a rough life. Like you wouldn't believe. One of these days you're gonna let me get you something nice. I prefer this. Let's go home. I'll get you more of them. Oh, you're a sight for sore eyes. It's so good to have you back. Hi.Hi. What's this? Oh, it's nothing. It's just a scratch. You know how clumsy I am. What the fuck, Morgan? What's this? I didn't want to tell you, but I know how much you hate motorcycles. One of the guys had one. Next thing I know, I'm upside down in a ditch. I'm sorry. But it's nothing. It's fine. It's not fine. Every time you go away, bruises, cuts, scratches... Now this? I'm here now, aren't I? And what about tomorrow? Tomorrow I'm gonna be here, too. And the next day and the next day and the day after that. You can't get rid of me that easy. Promise. If you can keep me down, sure, I'll promise. I will. Yeah? Shit! Are you okay? I'm fine. Just double broken ribs, but okay. The instructions were very clear. Yeah, and I told you I'm out. Morgan, it was a close thing. I understand. And you faced your own mortality. Yes. But look, it was an off day. We all have off days. Ah. Gyoza. They're very good. I don't think you're listening to me. I'm out. I'm out, too. Of soy sauce. Waiter! You're insufferable. Oh, Morgan, sit down. Come on. Don't be... Don't be so dramatic. Come on. It's not that simple. The client specifically requested you. Why? Because of your boyish good looks, your devilish charm. Who knows? Or maybe they're just fans of your work. It doesn't matter. The thing is, it's not one job. It's six. Six separate contracts. And each one pays a million dollars. Now, that money would set you up for life. What kind of life would that be? Whatever you want it to be. It's $6 million. I don't know if you're familiar with that sort of concept, but that can buy you an awful lot of bottles of Pinot Noir. We're doing good work. Good? Necessary work. These are evil men. Now, I know they're supposed to pay for their sins in the next life. But why wait for that, hmm? I don't know. This last job... I know, but you survived. And you know why?'Cause that's what you trained me to do. This is what you're meant to do. Now, these six contracts... Remember when we first started working together? I was just a kid. I had no plan, no connections, no clue. Now I've... I've had my time. Okay. There comes a point when you need to understand when to quit. When you're still able to wake up in the morning and enjoy a sunrise. I fucking love my sunrises, Caldwell. I really do. So if you want that money bad enough, you're gonna have to squeeze those triggers yourself. What's this about, Morgan? Hmm? There's three reasons why people like us stop. The first one is we find God. Now, in your case, I think that's extremely unlikely. The second one is, and I do hope it's not this, a woman. Now, that's never a good enough reason. Trust me, I know. And the third one... We're dead. Yes, we die. But not you, Morgan. No, not you. Now... Gyoza? Come on. They're really very good. I fucking hate you sometimes. You know that? Oh, my God. The amount of things they put in mayonnaise. Yeah, grab that pasta. It's my favorite. This is my corner right here. My favorite cereal. It's got a secret decoder ring inside. There is no prize. Come on. Well, they wouldn't put it on the front of the box. I mean, that defeats the object of it being a secret. Besides, I'm gonna use it to figure things out. Like why you deserve me? Well, I know the answer to that already. That's easy. I don't. Oh! For the kids. Too much sugar. Maybe something else. Keep them for myself then. Oh! It's fate. Our first pet. It's a plant. Well, yeah, but you still gotta feed it and things, right? Water it. Take it out. Like for walks and things? Sure. Why not? Your responsibility. Think it will be us one day? I bet they're out here every single night. Watch. He's gonna take his jacket off and put it around her shoulders. And then she's gonna grab his hand again. Wow! Four years, and I still don't know how you do that. You just have to predict. All the threads are there. You just piece them together and figure it out, I guess. What do you think about that couple? I think he looks more interested in the girl with the white boots than her. Yeah. And she knows it. But she won't say she's upset. Well, her body language will give it away. She's either gonna look away or fold her arms. So you always know what I'm gonna do next? No. You should come home with me. My parents are tired of only hearing stories about you. Handsome, smart, kind, photojournalist. They think I made you up. It does sound like you did make me up. What do you think about this guy on our left? He's wondering why you're avoiding the subject. Okay, I'll come home with you. Hmm! Hmm? Aren't you full of surprises these days? And you know what? You're not the only one. Oh, so you have some surprises, too.Maybe. And before you ask, it's not about my art program. Somebody help me! What are you doing? You're photographing him? It's all right. It's over. You're safe. Okay? We need to call the police. We can't just... We gotta go, Sophie. You just killed a man. Left his body in the park. We need to call the police. It was self-defense. I'll tell them you... Don't touch me. The things you did to him. How were you able to? You searched his body for what? For an ID. For foreign currency. Some sort of lead. You know, I need to find out who he was. Was he after you? So this wasn't any kind of robbery or... Morgan, answer me. I don't have the answers. All I know is that you are not safe with me. I just need time. Give me time. Show me the contracts. I want to see the goddamn contracts, Caldwell. Show me the fucking files or you're going to be the job! This is the second time this week that there's been a targeted hit on me. I want to know why. The timing of those contracts isn't a fucking coincidence! Well, I'll do some digging around. See what I can find out. Who are they? Oh, Christ. Don't you ever knock? Who are they? You know, there are certain civilities when you enter a chap's place, you know? The man who tried to kill me. Well, composition's nice. Subject matter's a touch macabre. Find out who he is and who sent him. Oh, I can tell you who he is. His name's Alec Drakos. Greek national, special ops, couple of tours of Afghanistan, became a mercenary, ultimately a gun for hire. And I bet he's the chap that shot you in Slovenia. Look at this. Better days. Now, on the plus side, a million dollars will be wired to your account. Plus my usual fee. And, um, I will take care of the finger business. Mr. Rossi, who has a liberal view when it comes to bribery. Caldwell, what the fuck are you talking about? Right. I forgot to tell you. Each kill must be confirmed by the receipt of a finger to a postal box in Paris. So, listen to me. You are in now. I have accepted the job. I didn't accept anything. Drakos was one of your contracts. Good result. Only five to go. Humor me. Who are the others? Who are the others? Oh, you know, the worst of the worst. Backgrounds in espionage in the military, and crime, of course. What's the thread? What do they have in common? Hmm. Which is? Their occupation. They are assassins, Morgan, like you. Just let me get this right. I've been hired to assassinate assassins. And they've been hired to kill me. And each other. Fact is, Morgan, they were coming for you, whether you accepted or not. But, on the plus side, same odds, even playing field. This isn't a fucking game! Oh, yes, it is. To the person who set this up, this is a game. And if you want to live, you have to play. Here. Morgan, you've got this. Anselm Ryder. No! No! A ruthless psychopath. Signature move, collect a finger from the victim. A souvenir of sorts. Pablo Martinez. Mr. Martinez is a poisoner. Yuko. Yuko is deadly with blades, and in close combat. The charming Demir is an opportunistic sociopath. He's locked up in a maximum security prison in Bosnia. Finding him is simple, but access will be tricky. Falk. Now, Falk is a legend and problematic. No positive ID, no photos, no patterns. Just a trail of bodies and cover ups that are only possible if Falk's working from within the intelligence community. Now, each kill must be confirmed by the receipt of a finger to a postal box in Paris. Demir. Who are you? What do you want? Good news. You're being released today. Pierre, I have a gift for you. Thanks, Inspector Leon. Welcome, Inspector Leon. Taking precautions, I see. Aren't you? Hmm. Maat. The Egyptian goddess... Of justice. My reminder to stay focused. Hmm. A penthouse in an empty building in Paris. How did you manage... I bought the building. Drink? And when we say drink, we mean vodka. Uh, I'm on duty. Don't trust a man who won't drink with you. That's what my uncle Mariusz says. But consider the source. One assassin's been killed. Alec Drakos. The responding officer's bodycam. How did you get this? I hacked the video server of the Rome police. Who killed him? We don't know. What about the others? Still searching. These are very skilled people. Aliases, no digital traces. They avoid all patterns. I handed you detailed files on all of them, didn't I? So stop telling me things I know, and start telling me things I don't. Six million dollars. Your boss said that would lure them out. Now where are they? Her plan takes time. And you're not the only one who needs to protect his back. One mistake... Then don't make any. Na zdarovya. Wake up. Where am I? You received a package. Box number 115. What do you know about it? Who the fuck are you? We're gonna play a very short game. You don't answer my questions, or you tell me some lies, I'll blow your damn brains out. Who are you and who do you work for? Answer me! My name is Leon. Inspector, French police. A finger arrives along with the name of the person it was attached to. We publish a fake obituary in Le Monde just to confirm receipt. Within a few days, we receive a file detailing every single assassination this person committed, and then we open investigations into them. How were you first contacted? Email, anonymous, untraceable. We simply followed the directions and posted the first fake obituary just to say yes. Under what name? Maat. Maat? What is that? Maat. We found it was an Egyptian goddess of truth and justice. She set the order of the universe right after the chaos of its creation. And? And she weighs the hearts of the dead just to see if they're too heavy with evil to reach paradise. What significance is that to you? I believe the message in the name is perhaps for you, no? Morgan Gaines. We're alive, but not quite living. Dead, but not yet in the grave. Stuck in this half-life, until it ends. When is that? Do you really think the last surviving assassin will just be free to enjoy his newfound riches? No, he'll be hunted down, too. Unless... Unless we help each other find the person who's holding our strings. The puppet master we're all dancing to now, and, and, kill him. Performance wasn't bad. How long did you practice that for? Hmm. He speaks. Mr. Gaines. It's in our mutual interest to communicate. Collaborate. We should share what we know. Why don't you share first? Oh, I'm happy to. Just give me an address and a time you'll be there, and I'll... I'll tell you in person. Hmm. We can share electronically. Okey-dokey, sweetie. But you're taking all the fun out of it. He bled out like a pig. Sure smelled like one, too. So how about you send me a photo of yourself now? Mmm. No. But I'm sure you smell better than poor Demir. Not gonna let you bleed out. I wanna see you try. We'll see out of the both of us who bleeds out first. "Great man and his pride confronting murderous men." A great man. As military snipers, we were taught when we lock onto a target, to whisper to ourselves, steady our breathing, release all consequence, and then squeeze the trigger. I used to recite this poem Death by William Butler Yeats. Catchy title. I think we're being told something here. The money was most likely put up by a client who had hired all of us in the past. We're from different countries. Our hits spread all over the world. Exactly. We took out our marks using different methods. I mean, nothing would point to one person doing all of these hits. Now he wants to silence us. Maybe. But why not just hire one of us to kill us all? Why now? Why go after assassins that aren't active? Demir. He'd been in prison for the last four years. I think they're trying to make a point. We're meant to feel the consequences of what we've done. What it's like to be targeted. Here's my number. It's a secure line. We make a great team. Oh, in fact, um, here's a little parting gift for you. It's Pablo Martinez's location. Bye, Morgan. Oh, I can tell you who he is. His name's Alec Drakos. Special ops, couple tours of Afghanistan, Greek national. They are assassins, Morgan, like you. Oh, Christ! Not again. What would be so terribly wrong with ringing the buzzer? When I was targeting Lesek in Slovenia, you knew those six contracts were already running, didn't you? My computer was hacked. Was that you? Your phone records show that you called Alec Drakos in Slovenia after you spoke to me. Again in Turino. You lied about his profile. He was ex-Royal Marines, like me. Sniper recon division, just like me. No friends, no family, grew up in foster care. Like me. You lied about everything. I think you've got this terribly wrong. You were his handler, too. You fed him his intel. You told him he could pick up the Lesek contract if he got rid of me first, didn't you? Morgan, this only works if we completely... You told him my location. You sent him to fucking kill me! Bullet came this close to my head! This close to Sophie's head. Bring back memories? "Better days," as you put it? Morgan, calm down. Okay, Drakos worked for me as well. But it was the game that set you up against each other. There was no other way. And choosing between you, it's like choosing between your children. But you did choose. And you chose him. No, listen to me. Listen to me. Of course I set this up between you. I had to. There was no choice. But I did so in the full and certain knowledge that you would win. You were never going to lose to Drakos. You're the best, Morgan. You're the gold standard. Bullshit. Was it always about the money for you? Did any of my kills actually deserve it? All of them. Each one. Once you see the lies, you see the liar, too. The number to my burner phone that only you knew was compromised by Falk. I gave her nothing. Her? So you're saying you actually know this woman. Your arrogance made you careless, you traitor. She knows who you are. She broke into your records just as I did. Up until now, it's just been the means to get close to me. But once she runs out of her patience, she's gonna come looking for you, and have much more of a hands-on approach. Huh? You're gonna wish I put a fucking bullet in your head. Morgan, I'm sorry. Listen, you can do this. We can do this. We've been through so much together. You were like a father to me. I taught you everything I know. There's nothing fucking left. Welcome to the game. Mr. Gaines. Tell me about your end, $6 million for the contracts. Their money is in an offshore account that traces to Kyiv, Ukraine. Now, if look at all our hits tied to Kyiv, you will find a common theme. They are all linked to gas pipelines. Which is a billion-dollar industry. Mariusz Ilych. His company has been awarded every major construction project for the past decade, because we got rid of anyone standing in his way. Including his own brother, Yakov. Now he considers us loose ends. Maybe his niece Jonna discovered what her uncle did. Now, if she traced her uncle's payments to all of us... But didn't know which assassin killed her daddy. She could have set us up against each other. Pablo Martinez, a bit of an anomaly. Never uses a gun, prefers poison. "Nor dread nor hope attend a dying animal..." No kills for 10 years. Disappeared after that. Been off the grid ever since. "A man awaits his end "Dreading and hoping all..." He's a lone wolf. No wife. "Many times he died..." CALDWELL: No kids. "Many times he rose again..." Oh, my God! Yes! Give me a kiss. Okay. Now you can come with me. But, I... Fuck. Drop the ax. Drop the fucking ax! Turn around. Slowly. Easy. That girl in there. Is that your daughter? Where's the mother? Breast cancer. Two years ago. Just the two of you here, alone? Take anything. Do whatever you want to me. But my daughter, she's only four. Please. Were you offered contracts recently? Answer the fucking question. I don't know what it is. I don't know. Tell me what date it is today. Today? May, the 5th. You kill people for a living. I know exactly who you are. So you don't fucking lie to me. Otherwise, May the 5th is gonna go down in your daughter's memory as the last day she saw her daddy alive. I killed one person. Eight years ago. And the nightmares only left me after my daughter was born. What about that job? Tell me about it. Daddy, you said 10 minutes for ice cream. Yes, honey. Daddy's coming. Please. Wanna color? I'm fine. Maybe next picture. I do a lot. You do. Whichever cup you want. Tell me about the last job of yours. Where was it? In Prague. I botched it. Slipped thallium sulfate in his coffee. But the dosage was too weak. Hospital for 18 days. His hair fell out. He lost almost 100 pounds. They cut a hole in his throat to help him breathe. I went to the hospital. Sat in the chapel. I'm not sure if I was praying for him or myself. After that, I disappeared. I was done. Daddy, why are you sad? No, honey. Dad is just telling a sad story. Okay? You just give me as many details as you remember. Somebody's pit us against each other. I want to find out why and who. He must know you'll come for him in the end. Oh, yeah, you can bet on that. Do you mind? Blue's my favorite color, but it's okay if you use it. Thank you. It's my favorite color, too. Honey, do you want more milk? Can I have more milk, please? Yes. You need to stay away from the windows. You might not have received those contracts, but there's still a million-dollar bounty on your head. Do you have a gun? I've got a home phone. Less than 10 people have the number. And they all live within 20 miles. I don't use my real name. I've gone as far from my past as I can. Well, your past has caught up with you. They're coming. Yuko. Yuko is a martial arts master most feared for her blade work, and she has perhaps some lingering daddy issues. Now, if her mark is a woman, she makes a clean strike to her heart. But, if it's a man, she prefers to cut him open. Evisceration. Her only weakness, she dresses very light, no armor. So, if you can manage it, a single bullet to the chest ought to put her to rest. Are you okay? What took you so long? Thank you. It's for your own good. Daddy, Daddy, what's happening? Oh... Come here. Come here. Come here. One bullet, my ass. Don't worry. Oh, shit. Death has come to call. I'm afraid so. It's been a long time since I heard your voice, Falk. Or should I call you Vicky? Don't call me that. Will my death be painful? It's a warm feeling, like a soft blanket. Just let it pass over and you'll sleep. How very kind. How long do I have? Hmm. About an hour. The fact that I'm not already dead leads me to believe that you need something else from me. What is it? Morgan Gaines. I want his file and mine. You already have his file. You hacked my computer. Well, I have the official file. I want the personal. The one that you keep. Vicky... Don't call me that. You seem to forget I'm dying. Why should I give you anything? Because of this. The antidote. I don't believe that for a second. Believe it or not, I don't care. But if you want to live... All right, well, let me think about this. Meantime, I think I'll fix myself a drink and... Perhaps you'd like to join me. We could have a good chat. Please sit. Sit down. Ah. You'll take that seat. Sit right here. As you wish. Hmm. You can't blame me for trying. I don't blame you. I don't blame you for anything. The past is the past. Now, give me what I need. So, here it is. Your file, encrypted. Who else has seen this? No one. Not even Morgan? No. As far as he's concerned, you're an enigma and a mystery. Gone. Now... Morgan, please. This girl, this woman... She is bright. She is kind. And she knows nothing, and she's nothing to you. Oh. So, um, I should let her live? Mmm. A little bit sentimental for you. I'm dying, Falk. Dying can bring out the sentimental in a man. Morgan was my protege just as you were. And whatever you think, I'm not gonna betray him. You betrayed him before. Not this time. So, if you don't mind, you might just let an old man rest his tired eyes, and enjoy what's left of the evening. Hmm. Have it your way, old man. Look what you did. You... just lost the privilege of a peaceful death. Pick up, Caldwell. Can I speak to, uh, SignorChivasso, please? Who's this? Morgan Gaines. Mom killed at age four. Dad gave you up. Foster care. Kind of unpleasant. I don't need my fucking history. I've lived through it. Royal Marine sniper taken under the wing of Ian Caldwell, who offered you the chance to kill evil men for your government. Except it wasn't always for your government, and the men weren't always evil. You're a monster, Falk. Or should I call you Agent Vos? Well, Caldwell, that snake. Did you know that he lied to you? That he changed marks' background, exaggerated their crimes, omitted that they had children, people that loved them. Just like I assumed you loved your mom. Time's running out. After I kill Ryder, you're next. Do you think that, um, Caldwell was trying to ease your conscience? You think you're a good man, don't you, Morgan? You're just a slave to your emotions. That's where we're different. 'Cause I'm... I'm free. You want to get to who's behind this or not? My condolences, by the way, for Caldwell. We all hope for a death without suffering. In his case, oh, it simply was impossible. Such a shame though. I want to believe that there's at least one person honest. Mmm-hmm. Well, at least you still have Sophie. She's real cute. Ryder will take care of her. You got good taste. Grazie. Ciao. Hey, you, I can't talk right now. Sophie, you need to do exactly what I say. Can I call you back? I was just... There's someone coming for you. You need to get to a safe house. Get rid of your phone. That can be tracked. The address is 105 Via Roma, apartment 42D. What do you mean someone's coming for... Sophie! Fuck! There's an active shooter at Arcabaleno School. You need to hurry. Okay, we're on our way. Sophie? Sophie! Are you hurt? Tell me what the fuck is going on. Okay. You deserve the truth. When I was younger, I joined the military. I thought it was a just cause, I thought I was doing my part for society. Well, it turns out there's a lot of red tape behind saving lives. I need to show you something. After I left the Royal Marines, I met a man named Caldwell. He became like a mentor to me. Introduced me to this world. He acted like a mediator between clients. These clients wanted people dead. Bad people. Murderers, rapists, corrupt officials. Over the years, I became numb. It all became meaningless. Until you came into my life. You changed everything. You showed me a life that I thought I didn't deserve. Now I need to fight to protect you. Because I love you, Sophie. I'm pregnant. I leave tomorrow. Go to my mother for a few weeks in Lisbon. Then I'll be back to my job, to my life. So whatever this is, you make it stop. You leave tonight. So? There are two this time. Two from the same person? Mmm-mmm. Nope there is a man's finger... and a woman's finger. What did you get yourself into, old boy? Why is that you chose the hard way out? Jesus Christ. Certainly wasn't loved as a kid. Everything clear, yeah? We know who we're dealing with. Shoot to kill. Let's go! We just got confirmation from the satellite footage. Ryder and Morgan are here. Don't worry, Jonna. The nightmare stops today. We're gonna get him.Okay. I will take you to the airport. Oui. Laced with strychnine. Very fatal and extremely fucking painful. Why don't you take a seat? It's quite the collection you have here. Somewhat of a signature for you now, isn't it? I bet if I dig deep enough, I'm gonna find Yakov Ilych's finger. I don't know that person. Don't fucking lie to me. Good thing about strychnine is it doesn't fuck with your brain. So you're gonna know when every single muscle in your body contracts simultaneously. The pain only intensifying with the slightest of stimulation. That's where I come in. Now give my fucking answers and I'll put you out of your fucking misery! Because she got to you, too? Huh? Tell you it was in your common interest... To collaborate? A little souvenir. Go, go, go, go, go! Cover me! AGENT 2: Let's go! Cover me! Cover me! Cover me! AGENT 2: Quickly! - Go, go, go, go, go! - Go! He's here! Captain! AGENT 2: Go, go, go, go! Cover me! Captain! - Go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go! He's here! Go, go, go, go! Get out of the car! Go, go! It's over! Come out of the car with your hands up! Move! Move! Move! Move! Where is he? Find his body. Get me divers.Copy. Yes, the current from the river should bring the body back to the south. Find me yet? Or you need a hint? I'll call you back later. The rules of that little lying game we played, you remember them, right? Is kidnapping me again absolutely necessary? Just send me an email or call me. The woman you're protecting, you don't even know who the fuck she is. Agent Vos and Falk are the same person. She's using you to kill people. All right, let's go. I have a plan to stop her, but we need to move now. You're going to help me whether you like it or not. Come on, Leon, I know you're a good man. Where would she be? Knowing her, waiting for your body. Inspector Leon. Sorry to call you late. We found his body. Show me his face. Sorry to interrupt, Falk, Agent Vos, whatever your name is. Why don't you explain to Leon who you really are? What a disappointment you are. Officer down. I need backup. Request some backup now! The brigade was alerted to the incident at around 12:30 a.m. local time. It's not clear whether the incident was an accident or deliberate. Construction mogul Mariusz Ilych wins parliament bid. The mogul's late brother, Yakov Ilych, founded the gas production empire before his untimely death. Yakov's daughter, Jonna Ilych, supports her uncle, Mariusz, in his campaign. There will be a formal celebration tomorrow in Prague. Thank you, Maxim. You are done for today, you can go. You forgot something? Don't move. Nice to meet you, Jonna. Or should I call you Maat? Maat? I don't know this person. Of course you do. You set up this game for vengeance. But in fact, it was your uncle who killed your father. No. He paid someone like you to do that. Just like you paid a group of us to kill each other. Six million dollars buys a lot of bodies. I don't. That money was to stop my uncle, and to arrest all of you. Arrest us? How? My uncle kept me close to control me. Made me part of the machine helping him. A mass murderer seized power over an entire country. He liked to parade me out. The poor orphan he saved. But if I questioned him, he would have taken out a contract on me, too. That's how he solved problems. I was helping them to end this. Helping who? Agents. Which agents? Jonna Ilych? Agent Vos. I'm taking over the investigation. Inspector Leon, you report directly to me. Hmm. So, um, is everything on here? Yes. As much as I could gather on my uncle's circle of assassins. Targets, money transfers. He kept encrypted records of everything.Hmm. What about, um, him? Falk? Do you have anything else on him? His real name or... No, he covers his tracks really well. We have nothing on him. Have you shown this to anyone else? No. I am really sorry about your father. If we had enough money as bait, we could offer a contract to each of the assassins, and then create some imaginary bait for them to kill. Lure them out of the shadows and capture them. How much money would you need? The lead investigator, do you know who she was? Agent Vos. Not the name she gave you, who she was. You handed those files over to Falk. That's the woman that killed your father. No. No! Once you did that, she couldn't risk being exposed. So she had to get rid of the evidence. That meant your uncle, the assassins he hired, and you. So she created a deadly game that she could manipulate from behind the agency. Even used Leon, fed him the exact lies to tell us. But that's not... My father's finger was cut off. Falk mirrors methods of other assassins. She was mimicking Ryder to throw off the investigators. Everything she's done has led to either trying to kill me, or for me to stand here and kill you. What about the money? Where is it? Gone. The agency has no record of it, or any meeting we ever had. So the money never went to anyone. Falk kept the money. I got word from the agency only an hour ago. They told me Agent Vos is dead now. She was on a mission in Italy, and apparently had a heart attack. Sophie. It's just me. It's okay. Is it over? I hope so. I don't like that answer. Oh, God, what did they do to you? It's okay. It's okay. I'll heal. Listen, I can't stay for long. Where are you going? I have to go back to the apartment. I have to get some clothes. I need you to do me a favor. You keep the door closed. If you're thinking about disappearing, I don't want that. We stay together. You promised me. It's a girl? Our daughter. Stupid kid. Morgan, you know your biggest mistake? You want to live. Not just survive, but live. Love. Care. It makes you vulnerable. It makes you weak. If you got a shot, you'd better take it. No. You're gonna suffer first. Just like me. Oh. How did you put it? "Feel the consequences of what you've done." We have unfinished business. One last contract unfulfilled. You're going to kill yourself. This conversation's over. You and me know better than anyone that every life has a price. Hmm. And I know yours. Ooh. You better run fast. You don't want to miss this show. Leon, Falk is still alive. She has Sophie. I need you now. I'm sending you an address. Be there. Sophie? Sophie! I'd be still if I were you. If you move your leg from that wire, you're gonna blow up. I guess we've got a little bit less than five minutes left. Give me your gun. Come on, give me your gun. Fuck! Good boy. So, we got, um, one last game to play. The game's done. It's over. You've won. Let her go. There's nothing more. So here's the spin. That's a countdown to disarm. So in about four minutes, you'll be safe, but, um, Sophie would have drowned. So you got a decision to make. Either you watch the mother of your unborn child die or you let the bomb go off, and you all die together, which is romantic. Whatever choice you make, I win, you lose. The game is mine. So, um, do you know if it's a boy or a girl? Have you thought about a name? 'Cause I think, um, Falk is pretty cute. Hey. Come on, get up now. Get up. Turn around. Show me your face. Have fun. Ciao. Sophie! Just stay calm. Stay calm, baby. Leon. Help us. Please! Hurry up, Leon! Sophie, stay with me. Stay there. Just a couple seconds. Okay. Baby, stay with me. Don't die on me! Breathe! Wake up. Don't die on me, baby. Sophie, wake up! Baby. Okay. Baby. It's okay. Baby. Oh, my God. Fucking bastard. No, no, no. Sophie, it's me! You told me we were safe! Sophie, it's me! Okay. You told me we were safe. It's okay. We're safe now. Okay. We're safe now. Okay. Just breathe. Just breathe. Okay. I thought I lost you, baby. Okay. It's okay. You're okay. Okay. I have to finish this. I have to finish this. Get that bitch. Help Leon. Call an ambulance. Falk!
