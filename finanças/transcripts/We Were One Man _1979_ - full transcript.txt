Not us, it's true Madmen, one doesn't know, one doesn't speak and that's normal, madmen aren't any use What if I became mad ? Would you kill me ? Yes, of course I have to go chop some wood in the forest. Would you come with me ? Why is there no trees in the sky, and no clouds in the forest ? Are you dreaming of a woman ? No There aren't much in here If there 'd been one, it would explain why I'm still here You see what happens, when you work with germans I come to your place, tomorrow no, no Yes, to bring you some food No, no I'd better come to your place -(..."bastard") Where did you gain your strength Oh but I have been stronger, when I was a kid, at the farm I worked as hard as grown-ups then I work at the bakery, and I lifted four sacks all day long there were two of us and I did lift the heaviest, they even called me Gorilla "The airforce social workers in Marignane" "The fight for Stalingrad" "Field-Marshall Franchet d'Esperey" I come to sleep with you It's much better, we can talk Is it your father ? yes Is he a soldier ? -Officer.

Four years ago Four years ago You live here since one year -Yes What did you do in the meantime ? I... I travelled a lot -where to? I went to Niagara Falls I know nothing about you It's always me that talks Me... aside the war I prefer your stories Your life, that's new for me It doesn't surprise me, you're as the whores -As the whores !? yes Before, when I went to the whorehouse I told them my childhood That I didn't have any father That I didn't have any Mom I told them how I was brought up at the farm the story of my cow then they were sad, and they comforted me they cradled me I love being cradled and often, they didn't make me pay Don't worry, I don't want to cradle you. Gute nacht ! One day, we'll go to the whorehouse together, ok Ruhe ! Guy ! Guy ! Catch that. Fine, isn't it ? I had a strange dream last night It woke me up, and I got up to write it down There was an island, in the ocean with a flock of penguins, on the highest hill But what I thought were penguins, from afar, weren't penguins but an orchestra, with musicians clad in tail coat we were both in the orchestra I played the violin, you too It was very easy, very beautiful too All the musicians were very happy But unfortunately, the consert ended in a dramatic fashion as one of the musicians made a wrong note there was a terrible fight between musicians, with the violins then, we ran away, there were broken violins everywhere but I think those violins weren't violins anymore, but real corpses the musiscians didn't exist anymore, but we were safe temporarily I think, because nobody on this island could stop the malediction that pushed musicians to fight together always on account of a false note Whose dog is this ? I don't know, it's the first time I see it -Come! Yeah, you're a good dog! You have to watch out Somebody is perhaps looking for it. Come! Nice dog No, I don't think so He looks like he's been erring for many days Come, doggy ! Run, run ! The cat brought me a wounded mouse, look Hey ! Killer ! Come ! Come closer Give me your hand Soak it, soak it well Come, mark, mark the wall Look, look, Look it's beautiful, isn't it They look like ants American ants I began Ajax' training Who is this ? It's Jeanine, who brings us food But you're mad - Don't worry, Guy told me everything, and I won't talk I hope she will otherwise... I suspected something, and I was worried You know, he's drawing my portrait let me see! No Give me that right now! Hand it over! -no! That's her ? Guy changed a lot lately Before, he was quite shy -It's normal he should change, he's no longer alone You see in the past, when I was in the HJ... -What's that...the HJ? "Hitler's Jungend", Hitler's youth I was only a child At home I was still considered as a chil But after our meetings, I wasn't the same The grown-ups feared us, and we didn't fear them anymore Why are you staying here ? Yes, why don't you go back to the HJ I don't know, perhaps I haven't had a true friend before Come closer together, I will draw you both Come closer ! Put your hand on her shoulder Is it OK like that ? No, closer ! Closer like that ? -Closer! Is this better ? -that's better,yes! And that, you like? I like, I like. What are you doing ? I know what you want. I don't feel like it Go ahead, she's alright. Yes I know, she loves you. She's willing to please you. Go yourself, I'm not holding you back! I'm going. I'm late, my father will look for me. Do we see each other tonight, at the barn ? Good bye, take care -Please, could you bring me back a radio ? Yes We meet tonight at the barn ?! It seems ants work continuously till they die of exhaustion. I wonder what happens when an ant doesn't want to do as the others, goes out of line, and declines to work anymore ? I crush them I go see Jeanine. Bye. See you later. I brought you real coffee Guy are you coming ? That's no substitute, you know So, Guy, wake up. Come. Make room Take it, it's still warm. It's good, no ? No substitute. Do you come ? We eat. -No, I don't feel like it You don't feel like anything now. What have I done ? You could be kind -No, I don't want to be kind Go back to your country -Yes, soon, I hope Oh ! Curfew ! You're sad because the dog ran away ? -No, it isn't that. You know, you have to be kind with Guy. He never had somebody, so his childhood hasn't been easy. Nothing is easy. All life is a struggle. There is no room for the weaks. But I also know there are other things, that I was never told, but which exists. I'm quite curious, that's why I'm here, and that's why I'm unhappy. no! Come...Come next room Watch it! I can't help it, they are flying fishes. Stop it, now. You will regret that. Chicken with F?hrer Sauce Spuds "? la Vichissoise" Blackberry compote Cheese and always alcohol and great french wine Germans shooted in Gutz, because Maquisards were hiding there Why isn't Jeanine here ? You see that ? When I was in Libourne, near Bordeaux I met a little girl in the streets, who seemed lost When she saw me, she began to cry, she wetted her pants I draw near her, her leg was damp and I told her : Why are you crying for ? -She answered me : I'm jewish I dried her eyes, and told her : Don't tell anybody or we'll both die. I saw her off her home, and she gave me this pretty band she had in her hair. What do you want ? "Adventure in Argentina", does that suit you ? I love Argentina I love Brasil I love Bordeaux Look what I've done I 've got to pee Where's the toilets ?
