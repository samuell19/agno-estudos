Crane, construction site, trailers, flagpole. MAN ON RADIO: And you? What about me? MAN ON RADIO: Are you a regular American? ISAAC: Uh, yeah. Regular Joe. MAN ON RADIO: A regular G.l. Joe... Army ranger or marine? You worked in our fuckin' ranks, huh? Had our training, then you fuckin' backstab us. Look, these fuckin' guys were building pipelines. Building up your fuckin' economy, you asshole. [ Groans ] MAN ON RADIO: Pipelines, huh? For our economy? Yeah, that's fuckin' money. Infrastructure, education, schools. These guys were fucking contractors. Not here to fight. War's over, bro. MAN ON RADIO: Bro? Whatever, man. MAN ON RADIO: it's an interesting choice of words. And yet I disagree with you, bro. The war's not over... Definitely not for you. You say-- you say a lot of fuckin' fancy words. What are you, Haji Shakespeare or some shit? MAN ON RADIO: Shakespeare? Military lingo is all poetry. Battle rattle, ghetto grip... Johnny Jihad, friendly fire... It's your turn, Isaac. Or should I say lze? What? What-- what do you mean, it's my turn? What do you want me to say? MAN ON RADIO: Tell me where you're from. Where's your family? I'm not talking 'bout fucking family. Oh, God! [ Gasps ] MAN ON RADIO: Okay, then tell about your brothers and sisters at arms. That's a negative, too, bro. MAN ON RADIO: I don't want any military secrets. Just stories. Eat a dick. MAN ON RADIO: I will shoot Matthews if you don't talk. Go ahead. MAN ON RADIO: Yes? [Grunting ] He is your second loss... ...first, Dean, now Matthews. How the fuck do you know about Dean? MAN ON RADIO: Keep talking. No. Fuck you. How? [ Gasping ] MAN ON RADIO: You carry his scope around. What was it your sergeant said? A dead man's scope? [ Gasping ] How old are you? MAN ON RADIO: Just tell me something, Isaac. Tell me about your comrades. Or I will shoot Matthews' face off. [Coughing] Okay. [Continues coughing ] Uh... yeah. Uh, we, uh, we play ball. MAN ON RADIO: I beg your pardon? Uh... Yeah, me and the squad. We, uh, play in the afternoon. Uh, get baked in the Iraqi sun. Uh, nothing else to do. No war to fight. MAN ON RADIO: Baked... what does that mean? Baked, like, you know, tanned. MAN ON RADIO: Go on. Go on? MAN ON RADIO: What about Sergeant Matthews, did he get baked? Did Dean? I ain't talking about fuckin' Dean with you. You (?fly fiucKm' Ha?. MAN ON RADIO: If I were you, I would start talking, Isaac. Tell me about Dean. What's the obsession, huh? What the fuck? MAN ON RADIO: It's interesting to me. The bond between you and your brothers. And I will shoot Matthews if you do not speak. I'm looking at him right now. It would be so easy to tear his face off. His family won't even recognize him. Is that what you want, lze? [ Bird squawking ] [Sighs] You should just answer my questions. All right, all right. [Wind blowing] MAN ON RADIO: So, tell me about Dean's scope. Oh, shit. Oh... Oh, fuck. MAN ON RADIO: I can see it at the base of the wall there. Why do you keep it? Fuck. MAN ON RADIO: Now, you said it's broken. Why would you carry around a broken scope, Isaac? Oh, shut the fuck up, man. How's this end? How the fuck this end? MAN ON RADIO: I'm sorry? I said, how the fuck's it end? What's the fuckin' endgame? MAN ON RADIO: There's no endgame. I'm just enjoying our conversation. No, stop! Fuckin' stop, all right? You're not gonna get to know me. MAN ON RADIO: I feel like I know you better already. No, you fucking don't! You don't know shit! MAN ON RADIO: You're dehydrated, I know that. That's why I aimed at your water bottle. No, you didn't... You fuckin' was trying to hit me. MAN ON RADIO: No, the water bottle. [ Scoffs ] Nobody's that fuckin' accurate. MAN ON RADIO: And your antenna. No fucking way. MAN ON RADIO: And your knee. I know the popliteal vein in your leg carries enough blood that no matter what kind of bandaging you have, you will still be sitting in a puddle of plasma. You're feeling fatigued, lightheaded. And you will bleed out before nightfall. What the fuck is going on with this shit... ...you fucker? [Grunts] You psychotic motherfucker. What do you want from me, huh? Oh, fuck! [Grunting ] [Groaning] Fuckin' flank me? Fuckin' Haji. [ Radio static ] Hey, where'd you keep fuckin' going, huh? No, no, you're tryin' to fuckin' circle my wall, ain't you? Huh? Tryin' to circle round my wall, motherfucker? MAN ON RADIO: That's ironic. Yeah, I'm right, huh? MAN ON RADIO: You say "my wall". The very wall your country came here to knock down, you now try desperately to keep from falling. Oh, you find that fuckin' funny, huh? MAN ON RADIO: You should know: that wall you are hiding behind, was actually part of a school. Yeah, well, I'll piss on it. That's what I think about your fuckin' wall. MAN ON RADIO: You're hiding in the shadow of Islam. No, I'm hiding in the shadow of fuckin' death. I'm in the fuckin' shadow of death. [ Gasping ] Nice try. That's gotta be a 20 mag... [ Continues gasping ] So all the guys... ...it's gotta be a 2O mag. One in Matthews, 3 in me... That 7.62-- That 7.62 by 51 NATO round is U.S. issued? Hey. Motherfucker. You wanna talk? Come on, man. What's up? MAN ON RADIO: You want to know the weapon I'm using? M-24? Mark 11? MAN ON RADIO: I would prefer an M96 Windrunner any day. I thought we were being honest? I know you're using a Mark 11. MAN ON RADIO: No, you believe that's what I'm using. But you don't know anything for certain. You don't know shit. Is that how you say it? You don't know shit? Say that again... ...I can't hear you. MAN ON RADIO: Okay... VOu... don't... know... shit. ISAAC: I don't know shit, huh? Well, go on. Please. Educate me, man. Come on, I'm listenin'... [ lndisctinct ] MAN ON RADIO: You Americans. You think you know it all. You think it's simple. That I am your enemy. But we are not so different, you and I. ISAAC: Yeah, 'cept I ain't a fuckin' terrorist. MAN ON RADIO: And you think I am? You are the one who has come to another man's country, [ Metal clanging ] Camouflaged yourself in his land, in his soil. No fuckin' way... MAN ON RADIO: From where I'm sitting, you look very much like the terrorist. [Wind blowing] You're in the fuckin' trash? No fucking way... 'less he's a pro. You're him. You're Juba. The ghost. MAN ON RADIO: A hundred men out there call themselves Juba. I'm just a man. 35 U.S. casualties, angel of death. That's why they never find you. Damn. You must've been days in that fuckin' shit heap. So, we trained you, obviously. Learn how to shoot, trajectory, zeroing the rifle, no reloads between shots. Learn all that shit and then betrayed us? MAN ON RADIO: Depends on the angle you look at it from. Only one angle. MAN ON RADIO: Yes, as I'd expect you to say. No. Tell me you're my enemy, fine, I'll respect that. We kill, We kill. But say you're my friend... and shoot me in the back? The only angle I see is a fuckin' snake. MAN ON RADIO: But if this friend shoots you in the back, and you survive, is it okay to shoot him back? I want you to tell me something, Isaac. Why are you here? Why are you still here, Isaac? How many tours have you done now? [Sighs] Why do you keep coming back? [Sighs] Is it because of Dean? Please, God... How the fuck did I get here? MAN ON RADIO: Is that why? Be honest with me, Isaac. Is it because of Dean? Just tell me... How...? How'd you know that name? MAN ON RADIO: Tell me one thing about him. Just one thing. [Wind blowing] We were from 'round about the same area. His cousins... ...went to same school as me. My dad knows his-- Seen his kid. Held him. More than Dean's ever done. Clem works by the fuckin' Stop n' Shop... MAN ON RADIO: Clem? Clementine, his wife. [Sighs] No fuckin' way. I can't-- I can't go back to that. Fuckin' day in, day out shit. [ Sighs ] And them, looking at me. And they would. They'd look at me, and they'd-- They'd see me. Fuck?. Nope. I can't go. I can't. I can't do that. Can't go back. This... Oh, God. [Groaning] Fuckit You happy now, huh? Now you know everything. You're fucked up, you know that? MAN ON RADIO: Why is that? 'Cause you gotta mess with my fuckin' head, too? [Wind rustling] MAN ON RADIO: Isaac, when this is over, the skin will be cut from your face. Your eyes will be gouged. Fuckin' shoot me, you prick. MAN ON RADIO: Your lying tongue will be stapled to your chest. [ Chuckles ] Just fucking shoot me, man, and get it over with. MAN ON RADIO: But I will let them find your body. Fuck it, I might just shoot myself. All right, you asshole. Where are you? [ Metal clanging ] Okay. [ Gasping ] All right, you stupid motherfucker. Bite on this, you fuckin' Haji bitch. [ Metal clanging ] Come on, show me somethin'. Send it, bitch. [ Gasping ] [Chuckling] [ Sobbing ] [Wind rustling] [ Groans ] Fuck. [ Groans ] [ Continues groaning ] [ Metal clanging ] Oh, fuck!

[Grunting ] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [ Panting ] [Sighs] MAN ON RADIO: That was foolish, Isaac. I could've shot you. I could've easily shot you. [Sighs] I29! I just want to have a conversation with you, Isaac. [ Groans ] Why are you trying to get yourself killed? Isaac, are you there? Oh, fuck. MAN ON RADIO: Isaac. Isaac. The radio you risked your life for? It's dead. [Sighs] Are you dead, too? You missed. I'm still here. You're not that fucking good. MAN ON RADIO: Ha! He speaks! Tear up the planks! Here, here! It is the beating of his hideous heart. What's that, one of your gay-ass Haji poems? MAN ON RADIO: American. -[ Radio breaking up] - Tell Tale Heart. Edgar Allen Poe. I didn't catch a fuckin' word you're sayin', man. MAN ON RADIO: Edgar Allen Poe. Don't you--? [ Radio breaking up] What's wrong with your fuckin' radio, man? What is that? MAN ON RADIO: You must've studied his work. He's an American great. His writing is really-- -[ Radio breaking up] - What is it? Don't look at fuckin' me. MAN ON RADIO: Did you know that he was an orphan? He tried to be a soldier, but didn't get very-- [ Radio static ] [Wind blowing] Shane... Shane, that you? MAN ON RADIO: He was a better writer than a soldier. [ Groans ] MAN ON RADIO: Once upon a midnight dreary, [ Groaning continues] While I pondered weak and weary... ISAAC: Sar'nt Matthews! MAN ON RADIO: Suddenly there came a tapping... ISSAC: Is that you? MAN ON RADIO: ...rapping at my chamber door. In there stepped a stately raven, from the saintly days of yore. Take thy beak from out of my heart, and take thy form from off my door. Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore." Or perhaps you would prefer Robert Frost? "A voice said, 'Look me in the stars And tell me truly'..." I see you, man! MAN ON RADIO: "Men of earth... I knew you were taking a nap! MAN ON RADIO: If all the soul-and-body scars-- ISAAC: I found that fucking weasel! MAN ON RADIO: ...were not too much to pay for birth." ISAAC: 12 o'clock. In the fucking trash heap! MAN ON RADIO: His poetry is so beautiful. [Wind blowing] [Chuckling] [ Gasping ] So, uh... you studied, huh? Uh... studied, uh... you studied here or abroad? ISSAC: Like, um... I know they got those, uh... study-abroad programs or whatnot? [ Matthews groans ] ISAAC: Hey! A shot from that distance, he's gotta be at least 25, 30 feet up, man! He's over 1,500 meters, 1,550 maybe. Right? Huh? Why ain't you talking, man? Come on, you there? Oh, fuck. Fuck. [ Gasping ] Are you there, man? [Wind blowing] It's just, you know a lot about books and shit. I just thought, I might even learn some Haji Shakespeare or some shit. [Sighs] MAN ON RADIO: Shakespeare? Is that the only poet you know? I studied English. Boy,you,uhu. You minor in sniping or somethin'? MAN ON RADIO: I was a teacher in Baghdad. But a bomb hit my school. ISAAC: You got it? Shane? MAN ON RADIO: I got shrapnel in my left elbow, still hurts. ISAAC: Fucking trash heap, behind the white trailer. [ Groans ] 1550. MAN ON RADIO: It reminds me of the students I lost. ISAAC: Come on, baby! Come on, baby, let's do this! [ Groans ] Is that why you shoot civilian contractors? MAN ON RADIO: As the scripture says, an eye for an eye. That's bullshit. You're no more religious than I am, man. That's just a fuckin' excuse to shoot up some Americans. You're good, man! Just keep going slow, baby, real slow! MAN ON RADIO: Is that a question, Isaac? Slow is smooth, smooth is fast! Yeah. That's right. See, that's what I don't get. How does an educated person like you become a fuckin' terrorist? MAN ON RADIO: You tell me. Oh, shut your fuckin' mouth. MAN ON RADIO: You're fading, Isaac. You like to hear yourself talk, don't you? I'm fuckin' fantastic. I'm chillin' like a villain baby. MAN ON RADIO: You are not fantastic. You have no water. You're dehydrated. The sun is... the sun's baking you. [Groaning] You're bleeding to death. [Sighs] [ Hoarse ] Cap'- Cap'. Captain Albright. MAN ON RADIO: What's that? Our legend. Trained me. Trained Dean, too. [ Groans ] He's coming for us. MAN ON RADIO: For your bodies. We don't report in, he's on your ass. MAN ON RADIO: Judging from your and Matthews' performances, I'm not concerned. Fuck you. He's coming for us. [ Gasping ] He trained us... ...trained us to survive. MAN ON RADIO: And won't he be disappointed. ISAAC: You didn't Win shit. You hear me, motherfucker? You didn't win shit! [ Matthews grunting ] From a place you will not see comes a sound you will not hear. Just a flash of fucking light. Boom. MAN ON RADIO: When I'm done with you and Matthews, everyone will know who the winner is. [ Gasps ] ISAAC: Shane! [Sighs] Hold still, man, hold still! [Sighs] MAN ON RADIO: Should I take Sergeant Matthews' head off? Shit. Hold still, man! Don't fuckin' move! MAN ON RADIO: Will you take something from Matthews? Like your broken scope? He's in my crosshairs right now. I've got eyes on him. ISAAC: What? MAN ON RADIO: I don't make empty threats, Isaac. I'm going to tear his face off. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... I carry around the scope... because it reminds me... of why I can't hold a-- hold a rifle again. [Spits] Okay? You listening to me? [ Gasping ] Dean dropped it-- the scope-- in the line of duty.
