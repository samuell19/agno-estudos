Ladies and gentlemen, our aircraft will be landing in Singapore soon. Please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt. The local time now is 2:22 P.M. There is no time difference with China. Thank you very much for flying with us today. Wishing you a pleasant trip ahead. Why are there so many people? Xiao Hong, My friend is at the front. - Xiao Hong. I come... - Hey! Queue up! I'll queue then! She's my friend. We are from China. - Hey, be careful. - Yeah, yeah. I'll put it in. This is very expensive. Be careful. Ok, ok. - Please. - Thank you. Eh, I want to go to this place. Huh? Oh! Geylang Lorong 33! Yes, Geylang Lorong 33. Ok, ok. Let me show you my boyfriend's place. It's a mansion! Right? So grand! No, it's not like that. Let me show you my boyfriend's photo. He is very handsome, isn't he? Who the heck is this? - Very handsome right? - Huh... Yeah. Handsome, handsome. My boyfriend... His name is Brad Pit. Brad Pitt? Yes, Brad Pit! Brad Pitt? That one? Yes, Brad Pit. He's very handsome, and rich! Hey! Where are you going? This... Ok. We are here. This is the address I wanted to go to! Yes, this is the correct address. There... You go out and you go up. 19 dollars 36 cents please. I prefer small change. It'll be better if you have coins. Hello? Lulu! What kind of a place is this? Eh! My heel! Fake designer goods really suck! I guess it's ok to be poor. At least he is still a Prince Charming. Brad Pit. I am. Is this some kind of a joke? If you're Brad Pit, who is he then? He? He is my twin brother. Twin brother? Then why did you send me his picture? I haven't been taking pictures recently so I just used his picture. We are twins, we look almost identical. I'm only 5 min older. What difference would there be? No difference! 5 min apart and you look this different. Can't imagine if you were 10 minutes apart. Hey, Big Bro. I'm going to go because I'm really late. But I'll see you later? Oh. Late liao, ah? You go first lah. No problem. Bye, bye. Only 5 min apart and the level of English is so different. Bye, bye. Come on up. Come. Wah! This is the living room. Watch TV here at night, it's very comfortable. The wind is very strong. Brad Pit. That picture you sent to me, it's not this building. It's the one next to this! Oh, I was giving you a sample of the surroundings here. How much difference would a 100 metres make? Both are in the same neighbourhood. No difference. Come, I'll take you to your suite. Suite. Suite you know? Suite. You mean sweet? Sweet suite. Sweet suite. Sweet and loving. Here you go! Suite. Suite? Yes! There's a sofa. There's a coffee table. It's a suite! Isn't there usually a bathroom? Of course, there is! Only six steps. Watch. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Here you go! The bathroom! Let me tell you, some of those bathrooms in hotel suites take more than 6 steps to get to. I know people in China love chicken feet. I braised this specially for you. Try! Oh, and one more thing... This carrot cake is our specialty here in Singapore. There's black and white carrot cake. I fried both kinds for you. Using OKI oil! It's very fragrant. "Say ok to OKI"! Try! I thought Singapore is famous for Chilli Crab? Crabs? Well, not really. Crabs are not good for us. They are very high in cholesterol. Not good for our health. Let's eat while these dishes are still warm! It's delicious, isn't it? Brad Pit. Hmm? What does your brother work as? Leon? He is exactly like me. We work in the same bank. We're twins. Naturally we would have the same interests. No difference! Just like this carrot cake. It doesn't matter whether the carrot cake is white or black. As long as it's delicious, it's good carrot cake. No difference. Come, let's eat. Suite? HAVE YOU MET YOUR PRINCE CHARMING? IS THE HOUSE HUGE? DID YOUR PRINCE CHARMING TREAT YOU TO EXPENSIVE DELICACIES? LUCKY YOU! GET TO BE A RICH MAN'S WIFE SOON! DON'T FORGET TO INVITE US OVER FOR HOLIDAY, THEN! What the hell you looking at? Stop bloody looking! Yes? Eh... Eh! Aiya! My sweet sweet candy. Since you're already here, don't be shy, ok? It's my first time meeting you. Shouldn't we get to know each other a little better first? Haven't we been doing that on social media? Aiya. That's different from real life! I need to get used to the real person too! Then can I at least get a Goodnight Kiss? I've not been feeling well recently. I'm afraid that I will spread the virus to you! Is it because of the carrot cake you ate just now? Maybe you ate too much and feel bloated. You feel like farting, but can't? No! I... Hang on! Hey! Take this White Tiger Balm. Apply a little on your abdomen. Massage it in. Then you'll be fine! This is Singapore's homegrown product! It's not that. I think it's because I sat for so long on the flight today. I'm aching all over. Oh, muscle ache? Hang on! Hey! You will be alright after using this Red Tiger Balm! It doesn't matter whether it's Red Tiger Balm or White Tiger Balm. As long as it's effective, it's a good balm! That's enough! That's all for now! I'm really tired! Huh? So early? You rest early then. Tomorrow... Brad Pit will bring you out to have some fun. That's enough! Hey! That is our Singapore Merlion. There's only one in the world. It spits out water! Do you see that? Those sharp thorns? That's the "durian" roof! Have you tried durian before? Never? And this place, it used to be the sea. Let's take a picture with that! Faster take a picture of me! I want that to be seen in the picture! LV! Huh? Ah, ok. Hold on... Faster! Move forward a little. Open your mouth wider. Ah! Wider mouth! Faster! Aiya. Snapping soon! Move backward a little. Ah! Ok ok, hold on. Snapping, snapping! One, two, three. Ah, done! Let me have a look! This is the biggest shopping centre in Singapore. Hey, it's Dior! Let's go in! The things here are very expensive! Let me bring you to another place and things there're much cheaper. No difference! This way! Can't believe you bought that expensive bag. Did you strike lottery? Yesterday, that uncle at Tiananmen gave me a big tip! Wow, you're really good, aren't you? You've been here for less than a week, and you're already earning so much money. Looks like I, the senior here, have a lot to learn from you. Lulu, let's go! Ok! See. Isn't it exactly the same? How is it exactly the same? My English isn't that bad. The alphabets are different! Well the difference of one letter is also a few thousand dollars. It looks the same from afar. No difference! Brad Pit. Tell me. Do Singaporeans always go to Tiananmen? I'm so old already but I've never been there! I'm not that rich! How much can a return ticket cost? I don't know anything about return tickets, but the entrance ticket is a few thousand dollars! The entry fee for Tiananmen is only 15 RMB! Oh! What I meant was the Tiananmen in Singapore! Not the Beijing Tiananmen, oh my God! There is a Tiananmen in Singapore too? Yes of course. Night club. KTV. Hey, so... Do you still want to buy this Diao? Sure! Why not? Go pay for it! Ok. Go! Hi, I am here for an interview. Hi, I'm here for an interview. Mummy is downstairs. That way. Thank you. Hi! Hey, who told you you could come in here? I'm here for an interview. For the cleaner position? Do you have an S-Pass? I'm not here to do any cleaning. Did you just get off the boat? I came here by plane! Hey, I used to work in the nightclub in Shanghai too. You've got to change your image if you want to work here. Look at yourself in the mirror. This is Tiananmen. A lot of reputable customers come here. With your quality, you should go to Geylang. I'm staying at Geylang! What's your name? My name is... Dior. We already have a Dior. How about Prada? We have even more Prada's. Bottega, Birkin, Bvlgari, Cartier, Chanel, Gucci. We have them all. How about Lulu? No, we don't have any Lulu here. Who still calls themselves Lulu at this day and age? Mummy, Terence Cao is here! Ok, we're short of girls now. The Ministry of Manpower in Singapore is very strict. Guess I'll give you a try. Singaporeans can be quite unique. Some might actually like your style. Alright, come with me! Ok, guys, today we will have a good time. This place is really good. The girls here are very pretty. Hi, I'm Bottega. I'm from Beijing. Hi, I'm Gucci. From Guangdong. Hi, I'm Chanel. From Shanghai. Hi, I'm Dior. From Dalian. Hi, I'm Ferrari. From Fujian. Hi, I am Lulu. I am from LA, U.S.A.! What's this? Sorry! She is here to clean the place. Oh, ok. What a relief! Lulu? Boss Leon! - You know each other? - She is a friend of my big bro. A friend of your "Big Brother"? Then please help us take care of our Lulu! Today is her first day here. Bottega, Dior. Come with me. What are you doing here? Aren't you going out with my brother? He lie me. He lie you? Yes, he lie me. Your brother was dishonest. He cheated me. No, he's a really nice guy. Very down-to-earth and sweet. Maybe he is a bit of a nerd, but... You know he's... Kind-hearted! You said Room 24? This is Room 18. Let me introduce. Lulu, this is my girlfriend Sonia. This is my brother's girlfriend Lulu. Hi, how do you do? I am Lulu. Sonia is the host of this TV programme. She is the host of a fashion programme. It's called Sonia LooksAt Fashion. Yeah. Whatever. Please don't hug me so tight! I'll be very uncomfortable. Hey, don't touch me there! Why are you so heavy? Are all twins this heavy? My purse! You carry my purse for me! Gosh. Gosh, you're so heavy. Oh, my goodness! He really works in a bank! He's actually a janitor? What "no difference"? There's a huge difference. I'd better earn more money and move out soon! Cheh! Bringing you the latest song by Chinese idol group, China Wine, A-WAH! Hiring kindergarten assistant? Responsible.

Big Treasure, Second Treasure and Little Treasure! My nickname was Super Nanny! Oh, you're from China? How proficient are you in English? My basic English is quite ok. Quite good actually. I used to teach the kids English back in the village. Something like this. M-ace. Mace. P-ace. Pace. C-ase. Case. Not too bad right? Wow! Your English is better than mine! Forget about being an assistant! You can be a teacher! Children, let's begin our English class! Repeat after me! Tired to death. Lei Si. Tired to death. Lei Si. Die fat. Fei Si. Die with. Pei Si.

No, you look more handsome in person! Is it? Oh you're here. I don't hear anyone greeting Big Sister Lulu. Big Sister Lulu. She is my real goddess. Oh, stop! What are the both of you still doing here? We can do whatever you want us to do! Go away. Go! Let's drink. Cheers! Eh, you guys must cheers too! - Are you ready? - I'm ready! - Are you ready? - Quick, do it! Fifteen! My turn! Five! Hah! You have to drink! Yay I get to drink! Drink more! - Can we high five? - Sure. Let's high five then! High five! Let's high five with the other hand! They said Terence Cao is a playboy. So Lulu is a playgirl! What do you want to eat? We're having a promotion for the green curry today. Can you speak English? Uh... yes. Green curry. Cheap. I think I will order the Thai-tanic beef. Ah, one "I am flying" beef. You want spicy? I want it exactly the same as in the menu! Uh.. Ok, ok. One Thai-tanic beef with no beef. What is this? Where's your manager? Hey, I ordered the Thai-tanic Beef. She said she would fry the beef but there is no beef here. He said he wanted the one with no beef. So I asked the kitchen to do one with seafood instead. I can't eat this, you know? I'm allergic to seafood. Sorry, sorry. We'll change it. Go to the kitchen! Sorry, sorry. We'll change one for you. Your turn to sing! Otherwise you'll have to drink! Mr Mah, thank you so much for your business. Let's cheers! Sure! Cheers! Ms. Sonia, your girlfriend looks so familiar. Sorry, I don't understand Mandarin. Sonia is a TV host. I don't watch TV. Obviously you don't read the papers, either. Sonia. Sorry, I don't know you. But let's cheers. No, thank you. - Mr. Mah is one of my biggest clients. - So what? I'm tired and I don't want to drink. I told you if you're going to be like this, you shouldn't come. Who knows what you'll get up to in places like this. Oh, come on. Miss Sonia, let's drink? Do you not understand English, Mr Horse? I said I don't want to drink! Why so rude? It's ok if you don't want to drink, but why pull a long face? What's so great about being a star? Stop putting on airs! Sorry, Mr. Mah. Hi, Mr. Mah! Lulu is the right person to look for if you want to drink! Because you're Mr. Mah. I'm Lin Lu Lu. Together we are... Mah-rilyn Mon-Lu! - Cheers! - Marilyn Monroe! Good one! Lulu is the best. Cheers! Cheers! Yes, you should be like Lulu! Don't always pull a long face! Cheers! Cheers! Great, steady! I'm great at singing. Do you know that? It's true. I'm great at singing. Come on! Cheers! Cheers! Hey, you ask Sonia to sing! No! I don't want to sing! First I will hit you. Then give you a kick. Lastly we'll do a V sign with our hands. Lulu wouldn't lie to you. That was funny that Marilyn Monroe thing you did. You're very witty. What is wei ti? You are good at talking. I'm good at many things. Except for speaking in English. My Chinese isn't good too. Ah, so you're Number 8. Why? I am Ban Jin. You are Ba Liang. Together we are Ban Jin Ba Liang! Ok. Not funny? You go pee then. Thank you. Hey, cheers! Hmm... you seem a little down. What's wrong? Nothing. Gosh, you're like a girl. Don't I know you well enough? It's work, isn't it? Nope. Oh, it's Sonia. What else? Well... Erm... Maybe... I don't know. Oh my God! It's Lulu! What? No! Oh, stop it. Please. I've seen the way you look at her. What are you talking about man? I have it on my handphone! What? I'm going to kill you, man. You better delete that. You think I'm crazy? No. Lulu looks a little bit like Sonia actually. No! It's true! It's just that Lulu has kinder eyes. You know what, bro? Just give her a makeover and take her out on a date! Now I know you're crazy. She is much nicer than that bitch anyway. Hey watch your words, man. That's my bitch you're talking about. Just saying. You know, if you go on a date with Lulu, your Mandarin will improve! And maybe then you'll get a discount at the KTV lounge! Hurry up! Oh, the posters are up. Quite nice. Nice, nice! Hey! Where are your passes? Don't play innocent. It doesn't go with my outfit. Hey! Even Sonia needs an access pass! It's here it's here! What a dope. I feel sorry for you. Go, go, go! Lift. Oh. Blow me. Not in my face. And orange is really not my colour. Sorry. Sorry who?

Sorry, Ms. Sonia. They're not paying me enough for this! Om... Om... Good morning, Ms. Sonia! It's not a good morning for me. What a mess... Hi, Ms. Sonia. Have you checked your schedule? It's SCHedule! Improve your English! Ms. Sonia, Rajesh is looking for you. Who's that? Your producer for the last 7 seasons? He can wait. And please, comb your hair! Oh, so sorry. How many times have I said that fashion is spelt with an "H"? H, H, H! Did everyone here at the channel not go to school? Or is everyone here just dyslexic? This is a fashion programme that we're doing. We are supposed to be hip, happening and classy. Not being able to spell is not classy! This is really affecting my mood! And do these clothes... Look like they belong in a fashion programme? Or is this the rack for the 9 o'clock news? Can someone please have some standards around here? Sorry. Sorry what? Sorry, Ms. Sonia. So it's Sonia Looks At Fashion: London Special, huh? - Yes. - What do you think? I think it could be fun. I think it's going to be great. What? Here's the script and rundown for the next episode. I have seen your script. It sucks! Erm... I'm not the writer. I'm the producer? Oh. You! Your script sucks! Do you actually get paid for writing? What did you use to write? Microsoft Word. I meant what did you use to write before writing for Sonia Looks At Fashion? Was it comics? Or The New Paper? Comics. Jesus Christ! Can someone please have some standards around here? So what's in the new season of Sonia Looks At Fashion? Well, Vanness Wu is going to be in town next month. Vanness Who? He's the judge of Asia's Got Talent? F4? Meteor Garden? Liu Xing Hua Yuan! I'm Indian and I know! Well, I don't understand Mandarin. Anyway, we'll need you to interview him. But his schedule is very tight. Well. If his schedule is so tight, maybe he shouldn't be on the show. We don't need some F4 Keypad Chinese singer judge person on the show. You're the tight-ass that we don't need. What? Nothing. Oh. My. God. Is that Marilyn Monroe printed on a dress? Who wears these things anymore? Who's our stylist? Is he or she from the 80s? TO: MISS LULU LULU, THIS IS FOR YOU. I'LL COME GET YOU AT 6:30 P.M. LET'S GO FOR DINNER TOGETHER. LEON It's real leather. Must be expensive! Hello? Do you like it? I love it. I also got you a makeover package. The address can be found on the back of the card. Makeover? Change of make-up and hair? You don't like my makeup and hair? Oh, no... not that.. It's just that the place I'm taking you to is rather classy. Oh! Ok then. I'll see you later. See you tonight. IS MY BROTHER THERE? NOT IN. - Are we ready? - Yes, I am lady. - What? - Huh? Nevermind. Let's go. Where are we going? You will know soon. It's a surprise? Yes, it's a surprise. Do you like French food? Friend food? Buddy meal? Do you like French food? I don't know French food. Only French fries! Lulu has never tried French food even at this ripe old age. Ahh! My heels are so high! This leather dress must be very expensive? I'm sweating like a pig. Slowly. No, no, no... This is not a pizza restaurant. This is a French restaurant. And yes, there's a 6-month wait! Ahh, Mr Leon! Welcome. Table for 2. Well, your usual table is ready, Ms. Sonia. Your place here is very tall and expensive. Sorry? Hey, David, just get us the menus, please. Actually just get us the sets. Hey, I want to look at the menu! I want to see menu. Thank you. Yes, Madam. Coming up! That's not Sonia. Some China girl who speaks with a funny English accent. You come here very often? Huh? How was your makeover? That make-up session, pretty good right? My makeover is very good. Miss Sonia, here's your menu. Just give us a few minutes. Yeah, sure. My name is not Sonia. My name is Lulu. Oh, so sorry Miss Lulu. Can I take you through the menu? You take me go where? Just give us a few minutes, ok? Yeah, sure. - Ok? - Yeah, ok. Thank you. There is no Chinese translation on this menu? I thought Singapore practises a bilingual system? Huh? Double fish? Double fish?

Look, just get us a Coq Au Vin and the "Catch of the Day". Ok? That's it. Hey, I think you'd better not talk to anyone here. Don't talk to them. Why? No reason. Just because! Hi, Sonia. I didn't want to disturb you. But I'm such a big fan of your show Sonia Looks At Fashion. May I have a picture with you, please? Yeah, sure! Let me take a picture for you! Would you like to stand closer to Sonia? - Ok, got it! - Thank you. Hey, Sonia. So what's in for the new season of Sonia Looks At Fashion? Look, Sonia is not well. She's lost her voice. But thank you for your support. Miss Lulu! Here is your Coq Au Vin. Lulu? Who's Lulu? Lulu is Sonia's middle name. Sonia Lulu Lin. No! My name is not Sonia! My name is Lulu. My Chinese name is Lu Lu. Lin Lu Lu. You know? Lulu! I come from China. I am who I am. Why should I pretend to be someone else? I know my English is lousy. So what? This is me, this is my style! If you don't like it, there will be others who do! I... I am not Sonia. But I feel like Zou-ni-a! Go away! Yo, bro! That was so funny! That was brilliant! - What are you doing here? - You asked me to book the restaurant. And I knew it was gonna be a gem of a date! Look! You're unbelievable. What? You do know you are sick, right? Hey, bro! She's just a China KTV girl, you can't be serious! Bro! Whatever. Hey, Lulu! Lulu! Come watch this quick! Watch what? This babe is my brother's girlfriend! She is hot, isn't she?

That looks like a PRC KTV girl stuck in the 80s. Funny why they used her for the English School. She can't even pronounce English properly. That's her charm! Have you seen the number of hits on her YouTube video? I come from China. 2 million! Boss, it will pass. Just like the rest of them. Not till we milk her first. Huh? What can she do for us? We are Channel F. Not Channel 8. We're an English channel, not an Engalis si channel. Don't you think she looks a little like Sonia? What? No way! No, look. There is a little similarity there. Wait, wait, wait. You're not thinking of getting this PRC to host Sonia Looks At Fashion, are you? She can't even speak English properly! Rajesh, what era are we in? Nobody wants to watch those proper programmes with proper hosts speaking proper English anymore! Yup. Young people have the attention span of a goldfish! They want funny. They want... Lulu. And seriously, Sonia's show ratings have really plunged. And she's still such a diva, you know? Such a bitch to everyone! Even the Wardrobe department! Yup. And that bitch has been asking for more money for the new season. Madness. We're already paying her more than both of our salaries. Maybe it is a good idea to meet this Lulu. Where do we find her? I recognise that KTV. Can you call Lulu? No, no Lulu. L-U-L-U. No, no, no, no. - Lulu isn't here. - How long have you worked here? - Everybody knows her. - Yes? No Lulu. I am the Mummy here. How can I help you? We want Lulu. Oh, Lulu. Lulu is busy now. We have Gucci, you want? What Gucci? We want Lulu. Look, we have the budget ok? Look, we are from the TV station. We want to give her a show. TV? TV station? TV station, so what? Let me tell you. Lulu is one of the "Star Awards Top 10 Most Popular Artistes" now! You have to call and book her 5 days in advance. And she only works 3 nights a week now. The other nights, she learns English. This part is very funny. This part is very funny. Yes? We have no more teaching vacancies. Unless you are Singaporean. Do we look non-Singaporean to you? We are not here to teach. Well... You are definitely not here to take English lessons, right? We are looking for Lulu. We want to talk to her. Another one looking for her. You are not the only ones. She is taking a class now. You have to wait until she finishes. How long would that take? 2 hours. Bye, bye! Hey, look! Why are they sleeping here? I don't know either. They're crazy! - Lulu, I love your look today! - Thank you. - May I take a photo with you? - Of course! - Sign here! - Signature? Sure!

I like my fashion. Hmm... yes... We like your fashion too. That's why we want you. Look, it will be your programme. You'll have creative control. Wait, I am the producer. Yes. But Lulu is the star. I can wear what I want? - No! - Yes! I can say what I want? - No! - Yes! Gosh! This is gonna be harder than working with Sonia. This is Sonia's show? Well, If you agree to host it... then it will no longer be her show. High Five! Yeah! Yes, why not? Hi! I am Lulu! I am in London! Yes! I want to use this scarf. My own one. Two, three, jump!

This fashion designer has been honored with a doctorate from a top US university Lulu picked up the honorary degree, a Doctor of Fine Art, for her work and achievements in the fashion industry When interviewed, Lulu shared "I love fashion, and I love the USA". This is the first college degree of any kind for the fashion... The South-Asian nation has bestowed the title of Datuk upon the immensely popular fashion host For her unique sense of fashion and sharp wit... Fashion designer Lulu has been made an honorary Dame by the Queen for her contribution in uniting the world through her Fashion label Diao As a Chinese citizen, Lulu cannot become a dame but can use the initials of the award Lulu DCMG said "The Queen is so nice. I'm going to name my leopard print collection after her so when people wear my "Diao" fur coat, they can feel like a Queen". This reporter had the chance to accompany Lulu visit her hometown and it was obvious that Lulu is much loved by all. There's one for everyone, don't snatch! I haven't seen you for a long time! - Don't grab it from each other. - To the children, Lulu is still so cheerful, generous, caring. How's your mother? They were chatting so happily - together like Lulu never left. - I play with them. - Where are they staying now? - Other places. Lulu's back! Big Treasure, Second Treasure, come here! Little Treasure! You're all grown up! It's obvious that Big Treasure, Second Treasure and Little Treasure have not forgotten Lulu. Two more? Although the journey has been tough, Lulu has never thought of giving up or giving in. She reveals, "The most important thing in life is to stay true to yourself. Nothing is sadder than living in others' shadows and pretending to be something that you are not". I will have a Salad Nicoise The lady will have a Beef Bourguignon And I would like... A Coq Au Vin. And I think we should have a bottle of champagne, no? To celebrate! You know, Nein, I do not believe in the Internet. It is rubbish. Hey, let me tell you. We used to have a very popular girl here. Her name was Lulu. She danced like this! Watch me! Hey, hey, hey. Don't you laugh at her. She is now an international star, some fashionista! That Lulu See Fashion! And yes, she really danced like this! Bro, I don't understand. Just call her. Nope. I know, it's her hair. She's such a big star now. She's not going to give two hoots about me. She would! How would you know? Let me show you. Aiyo! He's so heavy! Aiyo! My goodness! Fight, fight, fight. You think Sonia would do that for you? Never. In fact, no Singaporean girl would! Oh, careful! Chairman Lin? Call me Warren. You are cold? Let's turn the air conditioning off then. No. My name is Warren. You don't know English? It's an American name. Warren. Like... Warren Buffet! We are both Chinese. Let's just speak Mandarin. I prefer to speak English when not in China. I have an international enterprise. I have to communicate with many international people. Like United Kingdom. And I have Masters in English from Southern University at New Orleans, Louisiana. Wow, my English isn't that bad. I am happy the trade department connected us. You are rich. I am also rich. Oh, not at all, I'm only ok. Money is not everything. You're very successful in your career. Why don't you have a girlfriend? Warren, why don't you have a girlfriend? Many girls want to be my girlfriend. I have money. Every girl loves money. It's ok. I can give them a good life. Buy diamonds. Buy Birkin. Fly private jet. But I still can't find the right girl. Maybe your expectations are too high. My expectations aren't very high. My last girlfriend was 20 years old. Not very pretty and not very slim. But I still bought her a condo. Asked her to stay there. She said she wanted to go back to school. I said no need to study. Just stay at home. Go shopping, go for high tea. She said she didn't want. She wants to be like... Hillary Clinton. What do girls need to study for? A girl's most important job is to look nice and dress well and look after the man. I don't look so nice. But people tell me I am very witty. Girls these days also talk too much. Girls must be like Kitty cats. Everyone loves Hello Kitty. - You know why? - Why? Because it has no mouth, but it's still so cute! I'll endure. Why don't we order some food? Xiao Hong. Hey, Lulu Superstar. How was your date with Chairman Lin? Was he your Prince Charming? More like Prince Alarming. Chauvinistic. Low class. Terrible English. Then you should find yourself a Caucasian! Open-minded. Classy. Good English. Forget it! I think I'll just stay single my whole life. Don't worry so much! You're so successful, the queue to date you is as long as the Great Wall. What do you like best about Montreal? I love the pretty girls. Oh, really? I haven't seen any. You are one of them. Oh, but I'm from China. I should be the one worrying. Hello? Lulu? Are you listening to me? Huh? Ah... Oh hi, Angelababy! You are Luke Skywalker? Oh, haha. That name gets me all the chicks. Take a seat. I like your profile picture. But you look much better in person. And I do see the resemblance to Angela... Baby. But you don't look like you're 5 feet 9 inches. Oh, I'm 5 feet. And the 9 inches... It's somewhere else. So Luke Skywalker What is your real name? Seth. My name's Seth. Sex? Your name is sex? What's going on? Sex? Sure, why not? You want to see the other 9 inches, don't you? So, Sex, what do you do for work? You wanna make me work for sex? Sure, why not? How about we get a cocktail? Say a "Sex on the Beach"? You want to go to the beach? Sure, why not baby. But I think, first you need to slip into something a little more... comfortable. Aiyo! Hey! Like it rough, huh? I bet you like it like Fifty Shades of Grey rough. I like that. What do you say that you and I... get out of here? Hey! Your name is Sex. But I am a good Chinese girl! Good Chinese girl? Come on, let's not be coy, I recognise you. You're the KTV girl who made it big, right? You know what they say? Once a KTV girl, always a KTV girl. Come on. Let's go and have some fun! What the hell? You crazy? Oh my God! Ladies and Gentlemen, now is the moment we've been waiting for. I'm about to announce the winner tonight. She set trends nobody thought possible. She's also changed the definition of Beauty and Fashion. And brought big hair back. The winner tonight has succeeded against all odds. She made the impossible possible, made the possible...
