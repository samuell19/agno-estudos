Line by line resync and more by Dandysubs on 20181103. Of all the animals on Earth, the most loyal is the dog. For this reason dogs have been used on battlefields throughout history. For decades, our military has attempted to create a robotic replacement for the canine soldier, but the technology has always ended in failure. Today, at Craine Systems, the company you trusted with the highly successful hornet drone program, we seek to bring you the war dog of the future. A-X-L... Attack, exploration, and logistics. Our fighting platform pairs the efficiency and power of a robot with the ability to communicate and intuitively bond in the familiar manner of a dog. The A-X-L's ability to carry interchangeable payloads will make it an invaluable asset to every branch of our military. Trust us with this contract and we will deliver the ultimate war dog. Last lap. Sense of urgency for Hill. He wants to try and win this qualifier. Hill overtakes Fontaine over the double jump. He's in the lead now. Oh, no, here comes Fontaine with a cheap shot to the inside that sends Hill off his machine. That's going to take him out in this race. Gonna have to go to another qualifier. He scrambles to his bike. His chain is off. That's gonna cause him to DNF... I lost it in that last turn. Bad time to have a chain snap. Got it? You have a spare? Buddy... this was the spare. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Love it! Yeah, baby! I'll be right back. That's sick, man, yeah. Upload that right now. - Hey, good race, dude. - Hey. - Come on. - What? You win one race and you think you own the track. With this team behind me, I could win all the races. All right, let's get your act together and get ready for the finals. Hey, fellas. Sorry to interrupt. My name is Chuck, Chuck Hill, and this is my son, Miles. - Sup. - Miles. Sup, dude. Tough luck on that turn, man. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. Tough break on that turn. George Fontaine. George, how you doing? Listen, I'm sorry, but we got a little favor to ask. Yeah, we... We broke our chain. Wondering if you guys had an extra one? Oh, yeah. Those things are always crapping out on us too. Next time, though, you might want to spend more than 20 bucks on a chain, 'cause they're kind of important. No. We'd pay you back. - We ain't got no problem with that... - It happens, man. Probably got a couple, right? Hey, Scroggs, get him one of those chains in the locker. No, no, no. Hey. We got one spare. We can't part with it. We got another race, right? You understand. You know, I think I do. Good. All right, well, you know, I thought we'd ask. Uh... Good luck to ya. Come on, Miles. Yep, you too. Hey, kid. Better luck next season. You'll get it. You're almost there. - Yeah. - Keep working. Hey! Let's go, son! Quit goofing around. Got a race to win. Let's go. Pick a line and go. Come on, let's go. This what you're looking for? I wasn't here. Yo, pass me the wrench. Come on. We got this. Riders pushing their bikes up to the gate. Ready to go, the line-up's set. - Got the best talented riders of the year. - Okay, you're a Fontaine. All right, you got this. Remember, slow is fast, all right? Don't miss any shifts, okay? As I say, Fontaine is the favorite here. Let's see what he can do. Hill, the underdog, about to drop 30 seconds. With a quick snap out of the gate, it looks like 23, Fontaine, goes to the inside. He leads the field now on lap number one. Riders now jockeying for position as they come through. It's still 23, Fontaine. Looking down the twisties now. Here they come charging down. It's still 23, Fontaine. Hill now starts to show wheel in there as he starts to gain momentum. With good lines... Look out! Hill now dodged the inside. Hill now takes the lead! It's Hill! Seventy-seven rider, Hill, now. Charging hard, out front. And here we go, the race to the checkers. And Hill cruises! The winner is Hill, the 77 ride. What, are you kidding me right now? Let's go, baby. Hey, see if you can get my grandma on the line. She could win this thing. Hey, Hill gang. What's going on, fellas? - Nice race, Miles. - Thanks. You too. I don't know what you're up to, but I'm having a party at my place. You should come by. Tons of cute girls. - Dunno, man. I got to work in the morning. - Yeah? You got about 12 hours between now and then. You got something better to do? Tell you what, man. Change your mind, follow the crowd outta here, all right? All right. I'll think about it. Thanks, man. All right, hope to see you there, champ. You know I'm proud of you, right? Oh, God. Here we go. Life ain't all about racing, you know? Sometimes you got to take your foot off the accelerator a little bit. What, if you want to lose? That guy, his dad's got connections, right? Connections means sponsors, and sponsors means... Chains for days. I get it. All right, look, I'm just saying. You really want this... gotta play the game. Let's go, go, go! - Get that sat nav set up! - I'm on it! God! Launch the drones. Are you sure? Launch them! We've got to track it down! Run the search protocol, and I don't care if it's illegal! Mom. What are you doing? I don't want to spend all weekend cleaning up this mess. Gracias, Joanna. I'm sorry. Just go have fun, and be careful. - Okay? - Okay. Hey! Look who it is. - Thanks for coming, man. - Yeah. I can't stay long, though. That's what they all say. Hey, I want you to check something out. Yeah. Yo, everybody! Listen up! What's your name again? - Miles. - Miles. My bad, bro. Everybody, this is Miles. He's that fool who always beats me. Seriously, this kid's straight sick. Didn't your dad do all the work on your bike? Yeah. Hoping to sign somewhere after Regionals. Maybe you can take over from me. Team Fontaine. What, you're quitting already? I don't know. Maybe. Piss my dad off enough, that's for sure. Might be good enough reason. You guys don't get along? I wouldn't say that. He's good for some things. For example... Dad, we really need this industrial-grade GelFire torch, you know? Really helps clear the brush off the track. It's really gonna help me crush the competition next season. Woo! You're crazy, man. No, man. I'm not crazy. Just primal animal, you know? Doing what our ancestors used to do. Burn stuff, fight, be barbarians. Why don't you give it a shot? I'm good, man. You do you. All right. - Scroggins, you recording? - Light it up! Wait, who's that guy? Never seen him before. Probably one of Sam's new friends. You know him, he's always expanding his pack. Hey, look at the camera. * I can feel it in your loving * * It's nice but not too sweet, my darling... * Can't help yourself, huh? Not your scene? Wouldn't think it'd be yours either. Didn't really have a choice. Why, because of Sam? Yeah. He was my ride home. What, you live here? In the back house. My mom takes care of the place. The Fontaines are out of town a lot, so... So, um... you and Sam... No. No, it's not like that. I'm just the help. Trust me. That's not the way he sees you. How does he see me? I don't know. Like... every other guy on the planet sees you once they've seen you. Thanks for the spare part, by the way. I appreciate that. Yeah. You're welcome. You take this out of the garbage? It was next to it. 'Cause you missed the shot. I like it. You shouldn't throw these away. She's a beauty, ain't she? Take it out later if you're lucky. Party's kicking up to phase two and y'all are just chilling in the garage. Listen, man, I appreciate the invite, but I got to bounce. Nah, man. Let's kick it up a notch. Then you can wuss out. I got a couple I wanna introduce you to. Does it have to be so loud? Sorry? You know, when I said, "Go have fun", "go meet some people" yesterday, I wasn't really talking about... - I know, I know. - Okay. Hand me that crescent, will you? Thank you. Great race yesterday. - Yeah. - All that hard work's paying off. I guess. It just sucks, you know? I gotta bust my tail twice as hard as those other guys. And Fontaine... Dad, you have to see this guy's place. - He's got everything you could ever need. - Yeah? I would be winning Supercross right now if I had what this guy's got. It just ain't fair, is it? Look, I know. I'm just trying to figure it all out. - Nothing feels right. - Well, racing feels right. Yeah, but racing ain't gonna last forever. Sooner or later you're gonna get injured, or you're gonna age out of it. Dad, my grades were trash. We can't afford college. I suck at everything else. But this... This I'm good at. Yeah. But how many other things have you actually tried? We've been searching all night. Could be anywhere within a 100-mile radius by now. There's nothing I can do until we get a visual on it. All its comm links are down. Keep them off the servers. I don't want them finding out about this. Captain Webber. The demo is in two days. Do you have any idea what's on the line here? - Of course. - Then give me a straight answer. You've blown through a $70 million budget and we haven't seen anything close to battlefield-ready. It's evolving. We've made great strides here. It's showing levels of autonomy way beyond expectation. The US government has expectations, Andric. You promised us a machine that could kill. I'm going to need remote access to your lab and the asset immediately. After that, you're done. - Am I clear? - Crystal. Hey, buddy. Radiator dirty again? Nah man, I think I'm gonna, get some sleep. Nah, what you're about to do is come out to Beaumont's ranch with us. Rip some gnarly whips for Scroggins' camera. Share your talents with the world, kid. You're about to blow up. Come on. Sick, bro! Yo, Miles. Come check this out. That's super sick. Watch this. There you go. Dude, that was huge. Yeah, I can't wait to post this. You're gonna get signed for sure. Nah, people don't get signed off desert rat hillbilly crap like this. We'll see about that. That was sick, dude. Hey, you should come down to Nationals with us. - Yeah? - Yeah. Took a private jet down last year. - It was awesome. - Huh. You and Sara have fun last night? - We were just talking. - Just talking, huh? Yeah. No biggie. - Check out this one, man. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. Oh, Miles, before I forget. Why don't you say something for your fans, bro? Uh... Yeah, all right. Um... Yo, send it. Yeah. I get it, dude. Let's see it! Send it. Whoa! Hey, dude! You okay? That's not how you make a name for yourself, man. You got it, Scroggs? All right. Let's get outta here. - But he's got my GoPro. - Your GoPro? Who paid for it? We can't just leave him out here like that. You're right. I'm not leaving him here like that. You happy? Let's go. Let's go. Come on, hurry up. Let's go. Someone there? Hey. Hello? Hey... I'm not gonna hurt you. Calm down. Relax. Hey, easy, easy. What the hell are you? We'll get this out, all right? Chill out, all right? Is that better? Hey. You're even more hard up than me, huh? A-X-L... AXL? Is that you, buddy? It's gonna be all right. I'm gonna fix you up, okay? Hey, buddy. Thought you were gonna help me to finish up today. All right. Give me a call when you get this. Where are you? Wow. This looks extremely complicated. Hold on. Yo, send it. Yo, what up? Two thousand views in one night. Pretty good, huh? Is he okay? 'Cause he's not answering his phone. Sara, what do you care? You don't even know him. - Where is he? - I don't know. Probably back by now. What, you left him out there overnight? Yeah. We gave him enough gas to get home. What? Show me where he is... exactly. I just need you to hold still, all right? It's not bad, huh? All right. There you go, buddy. Can you move it? How does that feel? Yeah? Want me to do the other side? No? You should be good now. Come on, try it out. Get up. Come on. Good boy. Come on. Let's go. Hey, I'll bet you're thirsty, huh? Come on. Attaboy. Easy. Come on. Slowly. Hey! No. Come on. All right, stop. Yeah? You look good. Starting to feel better, bud? Whoa! What are you doing? Sniffing me out? Yo, send it. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Calm down. Relax. Yo, send it. Not my best moment, okay? Hey. Look at me. We're friends, right? And friends don't bite friends, okay? All right. Hey, stay still. Whoa! What? You wanna play? All right. Let's go. * I know you must hold secrets * * Such a long way from home * * You're a lost letter needs delivery * * Someday you'll be where you should go * * Come on, give me some spirit * * Don't take too much to get me excited * * Whisper, I'll listen to hear it * * Just show me some sign of life * * Someday you won't be so alone * * Someday you'll be where you should go * * Someday you won't be so alone... * Hey! Hey! Wait a second. I got something. That's him. I'm gonna try and crash his system. No! Wait. This is better than I hoped. Wait. Who do you think that is? Our human test subject. Are you kidding? He's gonna rip that kid apart at any moment. I don't think that's gonna happen. This is the breakthrough we needed. Stream the sensory feed. I want to see what it sees. Miles, you out here? Miles? What? Come on! Come on! - AXL, stop! - Miles! Knock it off, AXL. Come here. Hey, come on. You gotta calm down. All right, buddy? She's a friend, all right? Friend. Look. - Come here. - What are you doing? - Trust me. - No. - I wanna show you... - No! He's not gonna hurt you. Come on. Come on. Look, AXL. Friend, okay? This is Sara, and we like Sara, all right? Good boy. You can talk to it? Sort of. Yeah. He's still learning, you know? - He's like a puppy. - Are you being serious? Miles, it could have killed me! He, okay? Not it. You checked? Good boy. Stay, okay? Do you trust me? Come on. Easy. Easy. Wow. Hi, AXL. - AXL, right? - Yeah. I'm Sara. Nice to meet you. So you came all the way out here just for me? No. I just like the drive. Hmm! Yeah? I was worried about you. It's crazy what the military chooses to spend their money on. You really think he's military? Yeah. Maybe. I mean, clearly somebody spent a lot of money on him. And they gotta be looking for him. Whatever he is, we gotta take him back to his owner. What, for like a reward? No, because it's the right thing to do. You see all those little round things on his side and on his tail? You know those are bullet holes, right? Somebody shot him up. I don't think his owner deserves to get him back. I think he's listening. You listening to us? It's okay. We'll figure this out. Are you scared of the dark? No. No? Are you sure? I am scared of my mom, though. Well... You know, we can't get the truck out until the morning. Yeah, good point. You tell your mom you came out here? Nope. She'd freak out. Yeah, my dad's probably freaking out too. And your mom? She died a couple years ago. I'm so sorry. Yeah. I'll show you a picture. She's beautiful. My dad married up. Yeah, my dad too. It's too bad. I don't know much about him. Other than that he's been in and out of my life since I was a kid. Hardest part is watching my mom go through it. It's like she's completely given up on ever getting out of here. I know how she feels. I mean, sometimes I feel like I'll never get out of here either. I really like this song. Come on. * We get it almost every night... * You see that? - Come on. - I don't... I don't really dance. - Everyone can dance. - That's more your thing. - Not really my thing. - You're just choosing not to. * Everybody here is out of sight... * - Oh... - Just a sway. There we go. Okay, now we can get fancy. Add a little snap to it. * Dancing in the moonlight * * Everybody's feeling warm and bright * * It's such a fine and natural sight * * Everybody's dancing in the moonlight... * Line by line resync and more by Dandysubs on 20181103. Okay, so they're late on truck payments and medical bills. She actually got accepted to a few good schools, but... Her mother's totally underwater. Look, the point is, they'll be thankful for anything they can get. We should send the boys in there, pay them off, and take back the A-X-L. No. No? He's becoming more sophisticated with every minute he spends in human contact. We were six months behind schedule. This level of development puts us ahead five years. She's pretty great, huh? Way out of my league, though, right? Yo... send it! You don't have to rub it in. Keep going. Keep going. Almost there! Keep going. Let's go! That's what I'm talking about. All right, let's get outta here! What about AXL? We can't just leave him out here. What do you wanna do? Take him home? Miles, he's not some kind of stray dog that you just found. - He can hurt someone. - We do what you said last night, alright? We find out who made him. Come on, give it. Hey, give it! You know you're using the word "we" a lot? That's because we're in this together. I came out here to make sure you were okay. - That thing... - Needs our help, all right? Besides, if we just leave him out here, what do you think'll happen to the next guy who finds him? I don't know. We'll call the cops. Let them deal with it. Call the cops? You saw how he reacted to this truck. What do you think he's gonna do when he sees a bunch of police cars coming up here? Come on. Fine. So you're with me? Yes. Well, good. Hey, AXL! Atta baby. Hey, Dad. Sorry, I just got back into cell service. Yeah, he messed up my bike and then he just left me out there. No. Listen, I got to talk to you later, okay? I'll be home in a bit. All right? Okay, bye. Do you have any cash? I only have a five. No. Hang on. Let me check the glove compartment. Wait, you didn't pay already? It says you did. Wait, did he just buy us gas? Looks like he did. See? I told you we couldn't leave him out there. He hacked the gas pumps like he had your card. I couldn't even get my last dog to stay off the couch! Look, buddy, you gotta stay down, all right? I think we should go. It won't stop. That's good. Just take it all. Look at this. Dollar bills! Sam? Have you seen Sara? She spent the night at Lyssa's, but I thought she'd be home by now. I don't think she's at Lyssa's. She's probably hanging out with this new kid. You know, there's a way you can find her on your phone. You want me to show you how? Yeah, sure, please. Okay. You just gotta go there... Yeah, there she is. Right there. But that looks like the middle of nowhere. Balance it. Balance it. There you go. Flip it. You sure he'll be safe here? Yeah, I think he should be fine tonight. No one really comes here except for me. So you did all these? Yeah. They're amazing. You're really talented. That's crazy. You like that. - Did you know he could do that? - No. This is something new. The Department of Defense, in collaboration with CRAINE Systems, is pleased to present the A-X-L... which exceeds any UGV module available today. The AXL has been engineered upon a foundation of canine human interaction that stretches back millennia. As the war dog of the future, the A-X-L biometrically pairs with a designated soldier, making him as loyal as the real thing while being decisively more lethal. Specially engineered vehicles and accessories give the soldier that the A-X-L is paired with enhanced mobility and faster evasive opportunities. A suite of cyber warfare abilities, make him an ally in disarmament and intelligence. - Miles, he was made to... - Yeah, I know. The A-X-L not only has the ability to source and direct maintenance, but also to self-destruct in order to avoid enemy capture. AXL... AXL, stop, okay? Don't touch it. Of course, he touches it. Ow! What do you think this is? Clearly he just did that pairing thing with you. It's paired now. The entire OS is useless without that kid. The key gives him full control of the entire project. Then we bring in the kid as well. Looks like they have a visitor. - It's Sam. - Hey. I need you to stay here, all right? I'll be right back. Miles, you're gonna have to stay here too. - I'm not hiding from him. - If he sees you, he's gonna freak out. I got this, okay? - Hey! - Hey. What kind of sketchy business goes on up here, huh? You know me. Do I? What happened, Sara? You guys hang out or what? What's that supposed to mean? You know, I'm used to people using me, Sara. I just... didn't think it'd be you. I guess it makes sense, though. How have I used you? Well, you act like we're together. You suck up to my dad. My family practically gives you and your mom everything, and the minute I turn my back, you go and you hook up with some piece of white trash. Hey. Hey, Sara. Hey! Sam, you need to leave... now! What, because of this kid? Sup, Miles? Nice tan, bro. Okay, this has gone far enough. We need to get a team in there right now. Hold on. Let's see this play out. Miles, tell him to stop. He's gonna kill him! It's crushing me! - Come on! - Okay. AXL! Bring him here. Help! No! AXL, stop! Miles! I'd stay as still as possible right now if I were you, buddy. - Miles, just let him go! - Listen to me. I don't ever want to see you near her again. You got that? - Miles, just let him go! - And if I do, - I'm gonna send this thing after you. - Okay! - I can't hear you. What'd you say? - I said, okay! He's all right. You can't hurt him. Okay? Get outta here. Go! The asset obeyed the boy's directives perfectly. Let him go. And what if he had directed him to keep attacking? You better run! We could have had civilian blood on our hands. At some point, I'd say that's inevitable. And that doesn't bother you? Perhaps you've forgotten what business we're in. Aren't you a good boy? That was fun, right? What? I told you I'd handle it. Hey, I was just looking out for you. Well, I don't need you to. Don't you get it? I live in his house. My mom does his laundry, they pay for my grandmother's nursing home. They own us, Miles. - I was just trying to defend you... - Stop! You act like you're the underdog, but the moment you get any real power, you're just like him! You just dropped bombs all over a situation my family's been dealing with our entire lives. I'm sorry, okay? I let it get out of hand. Look... Just go make peace with him, okay? I'll take care of AXL. Did you hit your head or something? Or are you just choosing not to use it? I'm not going to leave you, Miles. And I'm not leaving you, AXL. Look, do you trust your dad? Yeah. Okay, well, I think we need to tell him. Because clearly, we're way in over our heads. All right. Okay, bud, I need you to hide over there, okay? We'll be right back. Just stay here. And don't do anything stupid, please. Ah! Stay. You're saying you just found a robot dog? I want you to see him, Dad. What is this thing? It makes the person who touches it his owner or something. - And you touched it. - Yeah. He has to obey everything I say now. All right, everybody. You ready? You guys stay here. - Ready, Scroggins? - Yeah. Come on, get your camera ready. Let's go. You're tripping. I don't see anything. No, man. He's in here. Just keep that camera rolling, man. - Right, you got that? - Yeah, I'm getting it. I'm not kidding about this thing. What's the ETA on the operatives? Both teams are still two hours and 30 minutes out. Hey, bud. Hey. Hey you remember me, right? What do you think we should do? I sure would like to see this thing. He sounds... Sounds like a piece of work. But, you wanna know what I think you should do? What you should do is turn it in. - What? - I'm sorry... No, Dad. No. They're going to use him to kill people. It's the United States military. Miles, that's what they do. They build stuff that kills people. It's not Finders Keepers, pal. - He ran away. - You don't know that. He could've fallen off the back of a truck out there in the desert somewhere. - He could have just got away. - No, he's riddled with bullet holes, Dad. - They were abusing him. - It's a robot. How do you abuse a robot? I don't even know. It's okay. Yeah. I just brought some friends. Clean this up real quick. Yeah. Here you go, buddy. Yeah. Come on, right here. Come here. Attaboy. Yeah. Good boy. Come on, bring it back. Come on. Good boy. Dude, you got this? That's right. Good boy. Dude, the thing's gonna kill us. No, man. He can't. Keep your camera rolling. Wouldn't want Sara to miss this. Miles, you need to understand something, okay? It's a robot, right? - That's what you said. - It's an intelligent robot, Dad. I'm telling you, he feels things. This is a weapon. You've got a loaded gun. Okay? Think about what you're going to do. - Let's just go. This is crazy. - No, no, no, man. He wants to play. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Seen one of these? Huh? Pretty cool, right? Kind of like you, you know? All metal and shiny and dangerous. I'm your buddy, remember? Move. Let me see this. Nothing to worry about. Yeah. Not gonna hurt ya. You're letting your feelings cloud your judgment, okay? - Miles. - You gotta slow down. - Miles. - What? We need to go. Now. Dad, just forget about it, all right? Come here. Wait. Whoa! Where you going? Just look right in the front there. No! Stop! Hey, are you okay? Ow! Sam is unbelievable! Miles, I don't think we can fix this. We're gonna fix him! Come on. Do something if you're still in here. Come on. All right, buddy. We're gonna get you out of here. Hey... This your son? Who's asking? We're investigating the theft of some classified technology. So, are you with the government? - Is Miles here or not, Mr. Hill? - No. I don't have to show or tell you anything until I see a badge, a warrant... or a gun. - You got it? - Yeah. Okay. - Push it. - Okay. Where do you think he's taking us? I don't know. I guess we'll find out. Have you seen this device in your son's possession? He keeps all his stuff in the garage. Don't move. We should go. Come on. Turn off the lights and don't hit the brakes. But I don't even know where we're going. Just follow AXL's directions. He'll know where to take us. Hey! You just put that gun on the floor there? That's right. Go ahead. No! No! No! No! I get to ask the questions now. Wherever it is, we will find it. It? What do you mean? This thing? There you go, AXL. He looks good. I guess now we wait. I think he should be fine. Can't tell if I'm scared or if I'm having fun. I know. I feel like my heart's beating really fast. Mine too. Attention all operatives. The A-X-L is back online. I'm sending you the new location. Move in for retrieval. Copy that. We're rerouting to the machinery exchange. Sweep the room. They might still be in here. Area's clear. Asset is inert. We're constraining it. AXL? I don't think it's dead. Well, let's go party. Deal with that punk Miles later. Stop! He's going after Sam. We're gonna have to move fast. Yo, Kirsten, don't forget the lighter fluid. You got it. - Yo, where's your girl? - Which one? Do me a favor. She always forgets the lighter fluid. - Yeah, sure man. - Get some matches too, huh? Scroggs, you hear that? Nah. Hey, wrap it up. - Let's get out of here. - Okay, okay, we're coming! Yeah! Hey listen, if you're not turned already, then it's time to get turned. Let's get this lit! Woo! All right, man. Enjoy. Dude! - Start the car! - Keys! - What was that? - Come on! AXL? Stop! - No! - Stop! Whoa whoa whoa whoa! No, no, no, no, no! That's... No, no, no! - Sam! - AXL, stop! - Knock it off! - Stop! This isn't right. You can't hurt him. You need to leave. Okay. Good boy. Miles, what's happening? Let's go! Ow! Don't resist! AXL? AXL, you there? Wake up, please. You got to get me out of here. It really feels alive to you, doesn't it? What are you doing to him? Well, I've got your buddy under control, but I'm having a little problem. Does that look familiar? Well, I want it back. And if you want to get out of here alive, you'll give it to me. So, where is it, Mr. Hill? She'd better be okay. You hear me? Or I'm gonna make sure everyone knows what you've been doing here. And what have I been doing? Aside from giving our men on the battlefield a fighting chance against an evolving enemy? Your creating animals that kill people. People kill people. This is a machine. A computer program that obeys lines of code that I've written. I've got nothing left to lose. That's my dog. Bring in the girl. - Sara? - Miles! Let me go! What are you doing? One step outside this box and your little friend will attack. Just give me that key and you can both go home. Wise up, Miles. It's about time you see what this asset is capable of. Let her go! I don't know where it is. I lost it. Well, you better start thinking fast, Miles. - Where is it? - Sara? Come on, Miles. I'm under a very tight deadline. AXL! AXL, it's me. Sara. Remember this? Okay, enough of this! I'm gonna ask you one last time, Mr. Hill. - Give me the key! - Come on, buddy. No! Come on, AXL. Come on, please. You okay? No, AXL! Stop, AXL! Stop! Let it go! We gotta get outta here! Don't move! Hey. No, he's in there. We're with you guys. Let's go. Come on. Attention. This is the United States Armed Forces. You are in possession of military property, which is a violation of federal law. You have 30 seconds to exit and surrender control of the asset, or we will enter the building by force. Hey, AXL. It's gonna be okay. Bye, AXL. I repeat, you are about to be arrested. We are armed and will fire if necessary. Exit the building and surrender the asset to us immediately. Stand down. Detain her for questioning. Securing the asset is our first priority. Attention Aviation Command. Requesting air support. Asset heading north. Live-fire take-down if necessary. I want that thing back. AXL? AXL, what are you doing? We gotta get outta here! AXL, stop! AXL, you gotta get outta here, okay? You hear me? You gotta go! You have to leave me, AXL. I'm sorry. I can't go with you, all right? You gotta get outta here. I said go! Go! Yo, send it. Stay where you are! Don't move!

Don't write me. - Don't worry, I won't. - Don't send me any pictures either. - See ya, Chuck. - See ya, Sara. Take care of the boy, will you? Have fun at art school. I will. And make sure he goes to class once in a while. Did you forget anything? Probably. - You? - Definitely. We've spent millions cleaning up your mess and paying witnesses to keep quiet. Hey, Sam, let's go! You've got a race to win! Do something with your life. But now we have a bigger problem. The code. Your code. It's building something. Reassembling itself. I need to know what it's doing. Oh... So... you're offering me a job? I'm giving you an order. And what about the two kids? We made sure they each got a scholarship and we're watching them closely. Then we should hurry up and find it... before it finds them. Hey. - I got something for you. - Who's it from? Not for you. I think it's from your dad. Remember this? Of course. Should I do it?
