Son, from India you are going to an Arab country for a job. It is a new country. Look after yourself and daughter-in-law. Mother, you do not worry. I will not only look after her and me,... ...but also send you bundles of money every month. I am worried about you,... ...and you are just talking about money. Son, work hard and be honest in your work over there. And always keep up the name of your nation. Alright mother. I will just do as you say. There will be just no difference. - And promise me one thing. - What? Your first child will be born in lndia. I promise you that we both will come back to lndia... ...before the child is born. - Are you happy now? - Very happy. God bless you, son. - Greetings! - Hello! Hello! Yashoda! Yashoda, God has answered your prayers. I have been promoted. - Is this for me? - Yes. It is for you. It is very beautiful. Tomorrow itself, we will go to our country lndia. Mother-in-law had a strong desire that... ...our first child should be born in lndia itself. So, this desire of hers will be fulfilled. But what about my wish? If God wishes, we will have a girl child. - But... - But what? I want a boy. Run! Monster Khaleel has arrived. Come on, let us go inside. Quick! Khaleel is here. Help! You all know that... ...Khaleel has started attacking our border again. Here...here! He has destroyed the whole area of Al-Gobar. He killed men and women. As usual, he took children away with him. I am feeling so ashamed about this whole incident that... And I am sure, that even you all must be realising... ...that till today, we have not been able to do anything. We could not even arrest the wretched monster. We all know that Khaleel is a cruel, wicked,... ...fraudulent and dangerous assassin. And Sir, one of his companions is a magician too. Khaleel attacks in the places suggested by him. He comes likes a storm, spreads destruction and disappears. And Sir, he takes children out of the border,... ...and sells them at an exorbitant price. I have thought of a solution for this too. For crushing this demon, I have asked help from such a man... ...who is very well-aquainted with every part of this desert. He has great patriotic feelings. And he considers his duty to serve the nation. He can shed his blood for wiping tears of the poor and helpless. The person is Sheikh Mohammed Al-Kamal. - Father, save me. - My child! Leave my daughter. - Help! - Leave my child. Leave my child. Leave me. Leave my father. Father! Oh Great Lord, please show us your miracle. - No. Leave my father alone. - Have mercy on this old man. Who are you? Help of the helpless! Friend of the poor! An enemy of the bad men! And death of torturers! - Father! - My child! My child! Sir, your honor is safe. No one can ruin it. - Good bye. - Thank God. My child, who was this angel? He was not an angel, father. He is Sheikh Mohammed Al-Kamaal. Excellent! What an aim! As if the bullet obeys your command. It reaches wherever you ask it to go. A man controls his destiny with hard work and practice. I have just shot bullets. Sheikh, even we shoot bullets, but where do we get such an aim! Sheikh's stars are shining so brightly these days... No no. Mohammed, before your arrival, I always decide that... ...I will tell you many things, open the book of my heart... But as soon as you come before me... ...I forget everything. I just keep looking at you. Mohammed, every moment of separation seems like ages. Break the wall of separation. Take me away from here. You may make me your servant and keep me near your feet. In your love, I just forget the world. Somehow, you too happen to remember me! Oh God! What is written? Tell us too. I will not tell you. All of you go away from here. Alright. Keep sitting here. Where are you going? It is something special. Can you see anything? Zahira, it would have been so nice if... ...God would have given many hearts to one person. Because, every single moment of youth... ...seems longer than a lifetime. And this cannot be tolerated by just one heart. I know it. And my heart knows it. And God knows, how I have spent these moments,... ...without you. And now I am only waiting for the moment... ...when you become a bride, hide your moon like beautiful... ...face behind a veil and come to my house. I will feel proud of my destiny... ...and will thank the one who wrote my destiny. - Really? - Yes, Zahina. Really! I can hear his voice. Even your voice is reaching me. Oh God! What kind of miracle is this! Mohammed! This is not a miracle. This is passion. This is love. Wow! This is called luck. Firstly, God has made you extremely beautiful. Then He gave you a very handsome husband. We will be happy to get such a husband atleast in our dreams. If that is so, why didn't you get married to Sheikh Mohammed? Once he saw this moon-like beauty,... ...why will he look at smaller stars? You girl, what commotion are you creating? I am making no commotion, aunty. We are only breaking the blisters of our heart. You will keep breaking blisters all your life. Come on, the celebrations are about to begin. Come on. Abdulla! Who is Abdulla? Surprising! You have not heard Abdulla's name, before? - No. - Abdulla is an Emperor. He rules over this desert. You must have heard the names of great Kings,... ...about their palaces and diamond studded thrones. But this Emperor is the most unique. His palace is a small hut... ...which is not made of marble pieces... ...but out of mud. And his treasures are not gold and silver coins,... ...but a well of cold water. ...which remains full, throughout out the year. And in a desert, the price of one drop of water... ...sometimes becomes as much as a gold coin. A small hut! 7 date palms. And a well of cold water. All this is what Emperor Abdulla possesses. This will reduce the pain and even the wound will heal soon. Why? Your old eyes are already shining? The Caravan has still not come. You are already smelling the male camels? Have some shame! You have become old. Your feet are already in the grave. But you are still very romantic? I wonder why has God created women! The first woman that He made... ...was Eve, who removed Adam from Heaven. I wonder who all will you remove from here. My name is Khaleel. From wherever I pass in the desert... ...people's head bow. And you are still standing with a raised head in front of me? Abdulla's head bows only in front of God,... ...and not in front of any human being. We want water, you old man! Not for free! I will pay you its price. You are young. You also have enough strength in you. The well is in front of you. Quench your thirst and go away. Why didn't you allow me to kill this man? Fool! In a desert, one a drop of water is valuable than life. If we kill him, who will look after the well? Take this, old man! The price of water. You are probably going on a long journey. Yes. Away from this desert and the ugly people living in it. Abdulla does not take money from far away travelers. And once Khaleel pays a price,... ...he does not take it back. I have taken water from the well. So, I will pay the price to the well itself. See you again, old man! Sheikh Mohammed is arriving. This is your house from today onwards. She is my nanny Gangabai. Her father and my father were very close friends. Both of them died in a battle. Today is a day of happiness. Why are you talking about sorrow? May God keep both of you happy. And may our daughter-in-law be a mother, soon. Come. Where are you all going? Come with me. I am really moved on hearing her story. God alone knows what is in his mind. Abdulla, it is a five day journey. I am worried about her and not about myself. She is pregnant. She should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. What if something happens on the way? This is the only fear I am having. That is why I was saying, give me your goat. We may need milk on the way. This poor woman has got nothing. I will pay the price of the goat. No, Aameer, I do not want anything. You take the goat with you. But keep her tied. I had given her away thrice before this. But she comes back. We will leave now! Come, my child. Aameer, it is a night journey. Don't go right now. I am not feeling good about it. Abdulla, God is with us. My child! May God protect you. You have run away again? What will Aameer think now? What is this? How did you get hurt? There is no wound here. Did anything... Lord, have mercy. Aameer! I had told you not to go. Baba! Help me, Baba. Have patience, my child. Have courage! Have courage! Save my child, Baba. Save my child. Keep courage, my dear child. Save my child, Baba. Have patience, my child. See this, my child! God has given you the biggest gift of life. You have got a son. Baba, take a swear upon your Allah,... ...that you will protect my child. I am dying. I have given this child to you. Take an oath! You must look after him. Take an oath, Baba! Yes, my dear. I take an oath,... ...that as long as I live... ...I will protect your child. Krishna! Krishna? Hindu? Oh Lord Allah, what have you done? What should I do about this? Were should I take it? No! God does not pity those who do not pity others. Carry an innocent and orphan child... ...and hold it close to your heart. Oh my new born oldie,... ...you have more wrinkles than me. Now he will live with us. Love him also, as much as you all love me. Why are you crying? Why is he crying? Does anyone understand why he is crying? Tell me! Why are you looking at my face? Now just stand here. Do not move. What are you searching for, Abdulla? I could tell you that only if I could find anything like that? There are so many things here and you cannot see anything? What stupid goods have you brought this time! Is there nothing for a baby? How big is he? By God's grace, he is this big. He is very small. I have a poor friend. A son has been born to him. I wanted something for him. Then what was the need to narrate such a long story? You should have just said that you want things for a child. I have got lots of it. See this. See! I have got all this. So many things for such a small child? This is very less! I have only shown you essential things for children. But where is the milk bottle? Milk bottle? Doesn't the baby's mother get milk? No, she does not. Just give the bottle. Alright. Take this. Is this a milk bottle? First, open this. Strange man! Ahmed! Abdulla! - Greetings! - Greetings to you too! - Oh Abdulla! - I was so eager to hear the sound of your bugle. And Abdulla, I was so eager to see you. But a new oil company has opened. I have got the work of transporting goods. That is why l could not come here. That is why I sent your things through Aameer. What is the matter, Abdulla Didn't you get the things? I got the things. But poor Aameer! Those cruel people killed an angel. Aameer died? Another injustice took place that night. The killers badly injured a woman. The woman gave birth to a child before dying. - A child? - Yes. Come. The woman was Hindu. This is a Hindu woman's child. Oh God! Are you mad? You will keep a Hindu child in your house? Why? Isn't a Hindu's child a human being? If you were in my place, you too would have done the same thing. He was born in my hands. Look! He is such a sweet child. He looks so pretty. Can't you see any miracle in his birth? Abdulla, your big talks do not get into my small brain. What will you do with him? I will look after him as my own child. He has such a beautiful face. Abdulla, when you make him a Muslim, you will be blessed. Ahmed! You promised the woman to keep this child alive. But you did not promise to make him a Hindu. The dying woman gave her treasure to me. If I fiddle around with her treasure, then... ...on doomsday she will drag me to Lord Allah like a criminal. Abdulla, why don't you understand? When she is a Hindu, how can she go before Allah? Ahmed! Abdulla, you hated woman all your life,... ...because one woman had cheated you. Because of her, you left the whole world,... ...and settled down in this desert. All due to a woman! And today, you cannot convert this boy into a Muslim,... ...because you promised a woman, that too a Hindu woman? Ahmed, the one who died was not a woman. She was a mother. A woman may have any religion. But a mother has no religion. Because a mother herself is a religion. There is heaven at her feet. There is godliness in her bust. Sheikh, there is message fore you from the Headquarters. Alright. Give my regards to your Commander. And tell him that I am starting a search for Khaleel from today. What is the matter, Sheikh? Jamaal, Khaleel has again begun attacking our area. You get your men ready instantly. We have to leave soon. Nasir, lbrahim, make preparations quickly. Military has asked help from me. I must go there immediately. - Yes, Zaina. - But... Look after yourself. Do not worry. - Greetings! - Greetings! - Nasir! - Sheikh! - You go towards the desert. Jamaal, you look for Khaleel all around the green areas. As soon as you have any news, inform me in Albatore. But remember! He is very dangerous. - He should not be able to flee. - Sheikh! Mohammed! Greetings1 Mohammed, I am feeling very happy to see you. Even I feel extremely happy to meet you. Sir, if you permit us, can we drink water from the well? - Ofcourse! - Thank you. - Is he your grandson? - Can't he be my son? The conditions in which Allah gave me this child,... ...he is a son to me. Some months ago... - Jamaal! - Nasir, fill up some water. Sir, by giving shelter to this innocent and orphan child... ...you have done a great favor to mankind. I am in search of the villainous monster... ...who killed his mother and many more innocent people. By God's good will I will soon kill him. These are the hoof marks of those monsters. But their direction is towards our camp. How did those rascals dare to go near our camp? It is helplessness! When the throat gets parched with thirst in a desert,... ...even a goat enters a tiger's den. I think they must have gone near the oasis... ...near our camp to fetch water. Come on. After very long, there is a cold breeze today. I feel like going into the valleys with my friends. - Child, you are in the third month. - Nothing will happen. I will look after myself. For God's sake, don't go. Horse riding isn't good in this state. But just listen to me. My dear, you are going to become a mother. Do not worry. I will come back as I am going. Nothing will happen. Fill up your pots quickly. This is Sheikh's area. He may come any moment. A pearl in a shell and a woman in a desert! Such things are got with great luck. Shut up. Hide, everyone. No. I am sure it will be a boy. Mohammed! - Zaina! - Mohammed! My wife is lying in between life and death. My child has not even taken birth through her womb. And God forbid, if anything happens to anyone of them,... ...then I swear upon God,... ...I shall follow Khaleel to the last corner of the world. Even if he is in his grave, I shall dig him out. By God's grace, your wife is absolutely fine. Thank God. Come. Unfortunately,... ...your child has died. This is a time of trial for you. And also... ...you have to give courage to your wife. That is very important for her health. And the biggest sorrow is that... ...she can never become a mother again. - He finished everything. - I know it. Their name will remain alive. By God's grace, it will always remain alive. I will write their name myself in history. And it will not be written in ink... ...but in Khaleel's blood. We went to his area and did all this. He will search us everywhere to take revenge from us. We must get out of here at the earliest. There are only two ways to get out of here. One is a shorter way. And the other one is quite long. We will go by the Al-Hazar bridge. But Khaleel, that is a very long way. You fool, Mohammed must have thought we will take short cut. He will search for us on the same route. And we will safely cross by the Al-Hazar route. Sheikh, by which route must Khaleel have gone? Al-Hazar or this one? I think he must have taken this route as it is a short cut. No. Khaleel is very wicked and smart. He will not go by the Al-thani route. He will go by the Al-Hazar route. We will catch him before he crosses the bridge. Boss, Mohammed and his men are following us. They are following their death and not Khaleel. All of you hide in these mountains. As soon as Mohammed and his companions come... ...shower bullets on them. And you three, come with me. Alright. Now we will watch the death of our enemies from here. Khaleel, what if they come upto here? Then we will break the bridge and kill Mohammed. - But our companions are on that side. - Let them die. Those who cannot protect the life of their head,... ...deserve to die. - Did you understand. - I understood. - Mohammed cannot be seen anywhere. - Shut up. I am having food in my hand. And this fellow is missing. Naughty boy! You are troubling me? Wait! Where are you going? I will bash you up. Dare you touch the child! Are you saying this? What made you change so much? Earlier, you used to hate him. And now, you are loving him and also siding with him? But you do not know one thing. You go and play. - Where are you going? - Abdulla, where are you going? Just sit here. Abdulla, you live in the middle of a desert. I roam everywhere and inquire. This child is not a Hindu. - What rubbish are you talking? - I am telling the truth. Abdulla, just as we have a ceremony after birth,... ...and just as children are taught holy prayers... ...there is some tradition for Hindu children too. I have got it written. Just see this. See what is written. Thread...ceremony... ...Balding....ceremony! This is done by a Hindu priest. And unless it is done... ...the child cannot become a Hindu. If this is true, I have not done my duty yet. Ahmed, my friend! Do me a favour. Go and bring a Hindu priest. I wish to see this ceremony before my eyes. I will surely go if you are asking me to. But see that. It is such a lovely face. - Make him a Muslim... - Ahmed! Don't look at me angrily. First feed me. Then I will go. I will bring him. - Did she get hurt? - No. Thank God. Naughty boy, you pushed the girl? Baba, who was the woman who took away the girl? That was her mother. Don't boys have a mother? Ofcourse they do, son. Everybody has a mother. Where is my mother? Your mother? She died. That girl's mother was loving her so much. Did my mother also love me that much? Yes, my son. She loved you very much. Baba, when a mother dies, where does she go? - To heaven. - Where is heaven? - Huh? - Where is heaven? Heaven? Come with me. Look there. That is heaven. This is where your mother had died. I had made this to keep her memory alive. Son, remember this place. If my mother die over here,... ...how did she go to heaven? Everyone has to go there after death, son. Just as a leaf dries and falls off a tree,... ...and a new leaf comes in its place,... ...similarly when a person's time is over... ...he leaves his life and goes into his coffin. Greetings Maulavi (Muslim priest)! I am a Muslim. Can I come inside? You have already come inside. But I am not a Maulavi. I am a 'Pundit'. What work do you have? Why are you crying? If you have to cry, go and cry in a Mosque. - Why are you crying here? - Maulvi Sir! - I am a Pundit. - Yes, Pundit. I have a friend who is a Hindu. He is my best friend. He got a son after so many visits to various temples. But look at his destiny. On one side, his son was born,... ...while on the other hand, the mother died. Now doctors say that the child will not survive. And my friend is very religious. He believes a lot in God! It is his desire that before the child dies... ...the thread... Thread ceremony? Yes. That should be done. It will be good if you come. I will surely come. I am a servant of the devotees of God. How far is that village from here? Not much. It is a day's journey. One has to go on a camel. - On a camel? - You will feel that you are lying on your bed. Where shall we leave? - We can leave in the morning if you agree. - Sure. Thank you very much. God, I lied for a good cause. Please forgive me. Ahmed! Stop blowing the bugle. Ahmed! God save me. Why are you screaming? You had said that it is a one day journey. Now 10 days have passed. Why did you lie? I did not lie to you. I told you one day and a zero. That makes it 10 days. We will reach in another 10-15 years. We will reach in some time. Take away all this. You are a sinner. I will not eat anything out of your hands. You said it will be a one day journey. It is 10 days now. Where do you wish to take me? Where is the sick boy? I have never seen a good Muslim man lie. - Maulavi Sir... - Call me Pundit! Panditji, I lied to you. I became guilty in the eyes of God and in your eyes. But God will forgive me because I lied for a good cause. You too forgive me. - Maulavi Sir. - Pundit! Yes. We will find the son too, in the middle of the desert. That is okay. But where is that middle? Is it in this world or outside, on land or in the sky? You will come to know that on reaching there. Now eat this. - I will not eat. - Please eat for God's sake. - No. - Then atleast eat for your stomach. - I will not eat. - So you won't eat? - No. I am keeping it here. Eat it if you feel hungry. Baba, you read your ' Namaz'. Why don't you let me read it? This is our prayer, my child. Your prayers are different. Why is it different, Baba? Because our religions are different. What is a religion? The one that shows the path of truth to humans. What is truth? - Whatever is not a lie or sin? - What is a sin? Whatever is against the law of God. But what is law? Son, even I do not know all that. I only know that you are a Hindu and I am a Muslim. - Our prayers are different? - Are our Gods different too? No. God is just one, who made this Universe. But only the paths to reach upto him are different. - But why is it so, Baba? - I do not know that. What are you listening to? Just see! Old lady... This Hindu son of a Muslim father will such a good human... ...someday who will break the useless walls of religion and... ...Iight the lamps of happiness in everyone's heart. Sheikh! This child has grown up so fast. If my child would have been alive today,... ...he would have been this big. Yes, Sheikh. Nanny, Mohammed's silence,... ...his longing for a child,... ...and tears in his eyes! I cannot bear to see all that. I am indeed very unfortunate. I cannot give the happiness of a child to my husband. Punditji, I gave you a lot of trouble. Please forgive me. I am leaving. Good bye! Abdulla! - Good bye. - See you again. I have never such a big liar than him. Do not get angry, Pundit Sir! Do not look at the lie, but at the motive behind the lie. After hearing the whole thing, I am sure you will forgive him. It was a very dangerous night. As if disaster struck through the sky. I wish everyone could do such good tasks as you. By then, all the anger, hatred, violence etc... ...will automatically disappear from this world. I have traveled for 10 days in this hot desert. But even if I travel a 100 days to meet a man like you... ...it is like a pilgrimage for you. Abdulla, I am very happy to meet you. Krishna, come here, my child. Sit. Tell me how do you do your prayers? Oh! I mean how do you pray? I read this every night before sleeping. He just heard me and learnt it. God quickly accepts prayers said with a true heart. I read this prayer every night before sleeping. I think he must learn his prayers now. - Yes. - Come on, say this. Learn it son. Now on, these are your prayers. No problem. He will learn it. It takes time to put him from one mould into another. Panditji, it is time for my Namaz. Excuse me. Sure. Go ahead. Good you came, Khaleel. There is a bad news. Your death and ruination... ...will be due to a child. A child? Do not laugh. Listen to me. Thousands of years ago, a Krishna had come... ...who had killed Kans. And now another Krishna has come with your message of death. This Krishna is the son of that woman... ...whom you had killed in your attack upon Aameer's caravan. Now he is growing up in Abdulla's house,... ...waiting for your death. Before Krishna becomes my death and comes to kill me,... ...I will finish him. Catch him and get him to the old fort. I will sacrifice him and remove his curse over your life. Come son, let us do the hair- cutting ceremony first. Then we will put you the sacred thread. Come. Keep quiet or I will get you shaven up too. Priest Sir, this was given by his mother. An 'Om'! Wear this 'Om' in your neck. Get up, son. Touch your father's feet. May you always be fine and healthy. Go and play. - Everything went on well. - Thank you very much. Tomorrow I shall take you to the city. There, I will search for some good Hindu family,... ...and ask them to adopt my Krishna,... ...and allow this old man to lie at their doorstep. Punditji, come with me. You old man, you are still alive? I did not expect you to be alive after so many years. Who is this? - Your son? - Yes. Catch him. Brother, what are you doing? What have you done? Why did you kill this innocent being? Baba! Leave my child. A Muslim, whose son is a Hindu! What is his punishment? - Shall I kill him? - No. This is a very easy death. Think of a way where he will enjoy his pain... ...and we will enjoy the sight. Go and get nails for his hands. Leave my Baba. Leave my Baba. Krishna! If he has even one bruise, I will kill you all. - Leave me, you torturers. - Shut up, old man. - I found just one nail. - One is enough. Think of something by which he dies and still not get peace. I will kill him like a dog and bury him with a pig. Hang him and nail him. This is a punishment which will not spare him even after death. The God of Hindus will never accept his soul. And Allah will shower mayhem over his soul. And the God of Christians will be furious to see,... ...an old fool on the gallows. His impure soul will keep wandering till doomsday. See the results your father is bearing! Take him away. Take away all useful things. And put the house on fire. Take this. Listen. Do not give trouble to him. Or else, God will be really angry with you. Let us go from here. Son, I will surely come to save you one day. Die slowly after a lot of pain. Khaleel, you may go to any corner of the world. I will follow you. I will not spare you. They kidnapped you too? What is your name? What is this thing? Is it made of silver? Give it to me. No. I will not give it to you. My father has given it to me. This is my mother's symbol. Alright. I will steal it on my own. He is coming into the death on his own. Wait! Tell us where is Khaleel. I do not know. Leave him. Let me ask him. You dog! Tell us where is Khaleel. I am telling you. Poor Sheikh Mohammed. He has been getting fooled by me since years. Now he must be waiting for me over there. And l... You have sent your men for misleading Mohammed. - What about them? - They know to protect themselves. It is alright even if they or they don't. So, you are eating now? You father had said, do not touch this. Or we all will get ruined. And your father had also said, he will follow him till the end. Where is he? He has not come yet. If you stare at me like this,... ...I will remove your eyes with the edge of this dagger. I know that you are praying to your God for my destroyal. Just as your father prays to Allah! Where is your God? Where is Abdulla's God? No one can do anything to me. Come on, fire! Quickly! Sheikh, we have arrested all the rest of Khaleel's men. - But Khaleel is not found yet. - I know it. Spread our men all around. My child, I have lost. I wish he was not born out of my own hands. It would have been better if he had remained in your womb. I would have been relieved that mother and child are together. Allah! What kind of justice is yours! What is this Godliness of yours? Whose God are you? You snatched my child from me. I will not worship that God anymore. Now on you are not my God and I am not your devotee. What is this, Salma? Even you have gone? One by one, everyone has gone away. Even I am very tired of life. Take an oath. You will look after him. Take an oath, Baba. Yes, my child. I promise! As long as I live, I will protect your child. Friend, give me this piece of Silver. Take this. Khaleel is laughing. Baba, do not cry. I will help you. I will save you Baba. Mohammed! He was just now calling for his Baba. He said, Khaleel did a lot of torture to his Baba. Search for his Baba in any case. Mother! Did you hear that? Mohammed, he called me a mother. Mohammed, it is about to be evening. And even Krishna is tired. Let us halt here for the night. Khaleel, since the time Krishna has come to your life,... ...you are going on getting defeated. And if you do not kill him soon,... ...then defeat and destruction will kill you. Mohammed is going to halt here for the night. - Listen! - Yes, Boss? Keep a close watch on Krishna. - Mohammed! - What is the matter? - Krishna is missing! - Where has he gone? - I do not know. Don't get scared. I will search for him. - Sir, Krishna is not here. - Where is Krishna? - Where is he? - I will not tell you. - I know where is Krishna. - No. Don't tell him. - Where is Krishna? - Coward! you are after an innocent kid? If you are man enough, raise yours sword and fight with me. I am asking you for the last time,... ...tell me where is Krishna. I will never tell you that. Krishna, my child! I have got ruined because of him. Now neither your Krishna will remain, nor my ruination. No, Khaleel. Fear God. Do not be so torturous. Spare this child. Take my life instead. Leave this child Tie this child. See for the house for the last time, old man! I have heard that he is your and your beauty's victim. I will turn your beauty into ugliness. Sheikh will keep on screaming on seeing your face. Khaleel, it is time for Krishna's sacrifice. Kill him quickly. No, you torturers. You coward! You have no courage to face a woman? Free me. I will cut you into pieces and send you to hell. Wait. This lioness is roaring a lot. Let me tackle her first. You talk too much. Just open me once. I will use the sword equally. Your wish will never be fulfilled. Mohammed will come now and finish you off. We have also made arrangements for his death. Khaleel, the time for the sacrifice is passing quickly. Kill the child quickly. Start! Kill him. No, Khaleel. Allah, help me. Greetings! You idiots! Where is Khaleel? Thank you. Do not come forward. Or I will finish the child. If Krishna gets even one bruise... ...you will face a very dangerous death. I am asking you to wait. You remained a coward all your life. Atleast show some bravery before dying. Mohammed! I am handing over... ...my Krishna to you. My child! Son, you have undergone lot of trouble. You searched for me and called me here from lndia... ...to unite me with my child Krishna. How can I thank you, son? There is nothing to thank me, mother. Abdulla wished that Krishna must get a good Hindu family. I consider myself lucky that l could unite you with Krishna. Son, for me, you are a form of God. Come my child. She is your grandmother. Come, my child! Krishna, my child! May God bless you.
