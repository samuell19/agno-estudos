Hey, amigo. Â¿Estas borracho? Poquito. Muy poquito. You Quirt Evans? Well, that depends a lot on who's asking. 'Cause if you were Quirt Evans... then I'd be looking at a dead man. Is that right? Well, then I'd say a smart man would lie. Unfortunately for you... I'm not that smart. [groans] [gasps] [groans] Grandfather! Mister, you all right? John, see to the man's horse. This man's hurt bad. We need to get him inside. Come on. You give me that horse. Let us take care of you. You're badly injured. We'll take you into our house. No! I gotta... I gotta go. I gotta get to the telegraph office. We'll take you there. Yeah, put him in the corral, John. Where that horse goes, I go. He's a trustworthy boy. Your horse will be safe and well cared for. Please. Easy does it. Whoa. [groans in pain] Sorry, folks, we're closed down for the night. I know, but it's urgent. Can't you just-- Come out of there, you! I can't break schedule! We're closed! Can't you make an exception? He's hurt very badly. No, I cannot, and I don't want some shot-up cowboy bleeding all over my floor. Get in here right now and bring that light. I'll tend to the horses. You cannot make me do this, sir. You cannot make me send a telegraph. Well, maybe I can't... [cocks pistol] but I can sure as hell shoot you dead. Fine. I'll do it. But the Union Pacific will not stand for this. You have got a lot of gall, mister, coming in here in my office, pointing a gun at me. There, write it down, but I am not gonna send it until tomorrow. Here. Let me help you. "Territorial Recorders Office, Fort Lansing." [groans] "Have found mineral claims on plots 234 and 235. Chart 1089." [panting] "Record it in my name." [grunts] That's all. And how shall I sign it? Quirt Evans. Um... perhaps we can, uh, make some sort of... [clears throat] [tapping telegraph] Okay, there you go, Mister-- [whispers] Is he dead? Not yet, but he needs help. Wow. Quirt Evans. Look at his gun. I just wanna look at the handle and see how many notches he's got. I don't know. I can't see any, but I sure as heck don't want to touch it to find out. Wow. This is the famous Quirt Evans. Quite a man with the gals, I hear. They say that-- listen to this-- they say, "He's closed the eyes of many a man and opened the eyes of... of many a woman." I'm sorry. Yes, could you please get my father? Yes. Sir? Sir, we need your help. Where are you taking him? We're taking him home. Quirt Evans? Are you crazy? I'd just as soon have a black powder bomb with a lit match next to it in my house! Is he heavy? He looks heavy. Solid, you know? Boy, oh boy. I know a dozen men who would ride day and night just to catch Quirt Evans helpless like this. Hey, I've heard about you people and how you don't believe in guns or violence and only doing good, but take my advice. Stay plenty far away from Quirt Evans. Nothing but bad is gonna follow this man. Thank you very much for your advice. - Have it your way. - Good night. Walk on. [murmuring] See ya, Quirt! Quirt Evans. "Ol' Quirt," I call him. Quirt Evans. Comes by here all the time. Old Quirt. Friend of mine. Does thee think he's going to live? I hope so. Could thee please bring Mother here? Oh, and fetch Doc Johnson, too. [coughs] If that doesn't quiet him, I don't know what will. I'll never get the bullet out with him thrashing around like that. Relax, Mr. Evans, we're just trying to help you. He cannot hear you. I'm afraid to give him any more sedative. It might kill him. I wonder what that delirious mind is searching for. He's probably in a lot of pain. Not with that much laudanum in him. It's as if he were reaching for something specific. By now, he should be completely immobile. - How is he? - Completely delirious. A gun? In this house, Thomas? Get rid of these. [panting and groaning] Maybe have to get something to tie him down. [grunts] - Are you crazy? - It's empty. [sighs] Huh. So that's what he wanted, his gun. - It's sad. - No, it's not. It's stupid. These wild ones, I keep picking bullets out of them, and for what? Because it's the right thing to do. Is it? All it does is prolong the inevitable, which is to wind up in the ground, feeding worms. No. Oh, that's right. I forgot. Never speak any evil, right? Now, go get some more hot water, young lady. Let's get this bullet out of him. Clint and his boys were found dead in the alley. You think this is the work of Quirt Evans? They still had the guns in their hands. Why, sometimes I wonder. Wonder what, dear? Wonder if I'll ever love or be loved again. A beautiful woman with a good heart? Any man would be lucky to have thee. Tell me again how thee met Father. [chuckles] Again? Thou's heard that story a thousand times. Oh, humor me. It's a good one. Well, he was... working on the roof of the meeting house. He fell off. I picked him out of the dust and into my arms. He always said I hugged him before I ever knew his name. And thou knew he was the right man for thee instantly. Of course I knew. He was a peaceful man, a man of the Society. An evil man would seek a far more profitable way of life than being a member of the Friends. Still, one never knows where or when we meet the right man. Temperance, the heart never lies, but... one must be very careful. I know how much thee miss Joshua. Every woman needs a man in her life, and Lord knows John needs a father, but... men like that, they... they just aren't the type to settle down. Trouble follows them everywhere they go. He may not even make it till the morning, and thou hast already judged him. The light is in everyone. It's thee I'm concerned about. I just couldn't bear to see thee lose another man, that's all. I know. He's got the constitution of a mountain lion. He'll pull through. Barring blood poisoning, that is. You can wash him now. He's in no danger. These wild ones, they always seem to pull through just fine. It's the godly ones who end up dying. You non-believers, you always feel compelled to question the ways of the Lord. I'm sorry, Thomas. Sometimes men in my profession, we have no other choice. Good night, Doctor. Thank you. I'll be back to check on him tomorrow. Keep his dressings clean. He'll be fine. Good night. Mrs. Whart... get that man out of here. But he's very badly wounded, Doctor. This is not civilized Pennsylvania. This is the raw frontier. You must take a realistic attitude. This is a town of mayhem, theft and depravity. Would that justify leaving a wounded man to die? "Build your house by the side of the road and be a friend to man, ye who believe." I don't mind you mocking me, Doctor. I was born with a logical mind. And a big heart. You've been a good friend. Thank you very much, Doctor. Between the rest of the town trying to run all you Quakers out and that gunslinger upstairs, you're going to need your Friends. We have everything we need. Good night. Good night. I'm gonna place my bet on the black ace. [mumbling] You're a shapely hussy. [laughing] Oh, Maggie. Maggie, that is just what I like. [chuckles] You always knew me best. [chuckles] Don't stop. Please don't stop. [breathing heavily] Oh, God, I missed you. [gasping] [panting] Chart... Chart 1089. [laughs] I found it. Chart 1089. We got to call it off, Maggie. You know I got places to go. I'm not the settling down type. I... I used to smoke corn silk when I was a kid. Your hair... your hair is just like that, yellow and gold all mixed up. All gold and silky. [sighing] No, don't stop. Don't stop, Maggie. [gasps] [click] Hello. You're awake. Well, I sure hope so. What is all this? What? Where am I? Don't you remember? Father and I helped you to the telegraph office. Is anything wrong? No. Well, the doctor says you'll be all right in a week or two. You were delirious, you know, two days and two nights. Well, maybe that's why I'm so hungry. I could eat a yearling steer. Oh, well, we'll get you something then. Mother? You talked a lot in your delirium. Mother, come here! He's awake. How is he? Hungry. Well, if he's hungry, I guess he'll live. Well, thank you much for housing me. Where's my horse? John has done a fine job of caring for your animal. Now, would you like some fresh smoked sausage and eggs? - Well, that sounds good. - Two eggs or would you like three? Ma'am, I feel like I could eat a dozen eggs and the chicken that laid 'em. [chuckles] Well, then you shall have them. Temperance, find one of Father's shirts and his razor, too. I'll make our guest some food. So I talked a lot, huh? Yes. I mean, I only listened because I thought you might say something that might aid us in helping you to... notify your family or wife, for instance. What'd I say? I mean, if you have a wife, that is. What did I talk about? You, uh... You talked about a Maggie, how she knew you better than anyone else. What else? So we can notify her, if she's your wife. No wife. Hmm. Um... you also mentioned something about a chart 1089. What did I say? [gasps] This can go from real friendly to real ugly real quick. You understand? Why don't you lay back before you tear out those stitches the doc put in you. [grunts] Thank you. You're very welcome. [sighs] [burps] [chuckles] Pardon me, ma'am, but that is one of the best meals this old cow-puncher's ever had. I've never before seen a man eat two dozen eggs, a pound of sausage and half a chicken. [Quirt] Thank you. I'll help thee with the dishes, Mother. No, no, you stay with Mr. Evans. Someone has to watch him, in case he explodes. All you folks from Pennsylvania talk that way? Talk like what? "Thee." Oh, we're Friends. Oh, yeah? Friends of who? Of all. The Society of Friends. And some people call us "Quakers." - Quakers? - It's a nickname. Some non-members claim we tremble before the word of God. Oh, I see. So it's a religion. Well, it's a... belief that all life is sacred. That on the wall there. "Each human being has an integrity that can be hurt only by the act of that same human being and not by the act of another human being." Is that Quaker stuff? Yes. So nobody can hurt you but yourself? Well, that's what Friends believe. So what if somebody shoots you in the chest with a bullet, would that hurt? [chuckles] Physically, yes, but in reality, it would really only hurt the person doing the shooting. Only the doer is harmed by the evil act. That's easy for you to say. Are there very many of you Quakers? Very few. Why am I not surprised? [chuckles] - [spittoon dings] - You the telegraph man? Certified operator, yes. We found these out in the street. They belong to a fellow named Quirt Evans. Heard he's a friend of yours. Thought maybe you could get 'em back to him. Just leave them here. I'll make sure he gets them. That Quirt, he'd lose his shirt if it wasn't buttoned on. I keep telling him-- Suppose you tell me where he's at, and I'll get 'em back to him myself. Where is Quirt Evans? You mean where is-is he? You ever notice how a fella starts repeating the question when he's either scared to death or lying through his teeth? Why don't I just put a bullet in his belly, Boss? That'll help him quit stalling and start remembering. Uh, now, uh... to be honest with you, I hardly know the man. Is that so? 'Cause you've been bragging all over town what good friends you two are. Maybe this will jog your memory. Wh-What are you-- [groaning] Great. I look like a Quaker. [footsteps] I brought you up an extra-- Oh. Please get back in bed. The doctor said you have to remain in bed for at least a week. [clears throat] Uh... I'm decent now, sort of. Sorry. - Howdy, Quirt! - Howdy, squirt! [chuckles] I see you're up. John, that is no way to address an elder. Hey, we're pals now, huh, huh? Oh, damn it. [grunts] Sorry, uh... You wouldn't want a pal to call me "mister" now, would you? - Huh? - See? Doc Johnson told me to let you know that some men over on Main Street were looking for you. Yeah? Who? He said one of the men was a Mr. Loredo Stevens. [clicking] Who emptied my gun? Father. A gun is a thing of evil to us. We never allow them in our homes, do we, John? John, go get my pants. John, no. Thee tell him to go get my pants. Go ahead. What? What are you looking at? Thee? Thank you. It's a good thing I'm not a tattletale. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, uh... The... words you used. "Thee tell him to go get my pants," I think you said. Yeah, what about it? Well, among us, "thee" and "thou" are used only to address loved ones. To others, we use the more formal "you" or "he." But between mothers and daughters and... husbands and wives... it's different. People we're more... intimate with. I'm sorry. Don't be. I wish thee to... speak to me like that. I could take you lots of places. And I'd go. Have I shocked thee? I wouldn't say "shocked" exactly, but you sure do get to the point. As did thou. Should I be any different? No, Temperance. I like you just the way you are. Come on out, Quirt! We know you're in there! Come on out, nobody gets hurt! Quirt, I don't want no innocent people getting hurt now! Where are my bullets? Outside. Mother buried them. Come out, Quirt! Son of a bitch. Why don't we just bust in? 'Cause busting through doors with Quirt Evans on the other side ain't my idea of a healthy pastime. [knocks] Thomas, let 'em in. That's far enough. Stay in the light where I can see you. Howdy, Quirt. You sure did run rings around me, that's for sure. I still don't think it was very fair, though, the way you took that claim from us, especially after me and my boys found it. Of course, I'm willing to listen to your side of it. I'm a reasonable man. That's right. Loredo's a reasonable man, Quirt. That's why he runs things in this here territory. So you run things in this territory, huh, Lorado? That's what they say. Well, I'm pretty new here, so I'm just going to have to take your word for it. [click] You nervous or something? I can't figure out why you're always stepping on my toes. Of course, that is your business. Guess I'm just a good loser. Well, I like a good loser. Of course, I like being on the winning side of any loser. You know, I had a lot of time to think, Quirt, when I was trailing you across this territory. You were trailing me, were you? Mm-hmm, that burned-out string of horses you left. Way I figure it, you don't really want that claim. Digging around in the dirt all day. Being a miner ain't exactly your line of work. Well, I don't remember it being your line of work either. No, no. No, I was looking after it for another... business partner. Now, we don't want these nice people getting hurt, so I figure you wouldn't have any problem selling it... to me. Well, I don't hear anything a-jingling. It's all right I reach into my coat pocket? Slow. [heavy thud] 5,000. Gold. Well, it's gonna cost you 20,000. [laughs] Okay. Of course, I'm gonna have to owe you. I don't have the 15 on me, but I do have the deed right here in this pocket. [chuckles] Well, isn't that convenient? Get it out. Suppose the lovely lady there brings us something to sign it. Still Lorado's hired boy, eh, Hondo? Picking up after him, carrying matches for his cigar. Go get the horses. Yeah, you go on and get them horses, Hondo. Git! [chuckles] Take that to Mr. Evans. That should do it. Good to see you up and around, Quirt. We heard you was, uh, flat on your back. Sorry to disappoint you. You just come for that 15,000 anytime. Anytime you feel able. Oh, I'll feel able, all right. You just make sure you hold onto it for me. Adios. John, saddle my horse, please. What do you think would have happened if they knew your gun was empty? [sighs] Well, let's just say it would have been Saturday Night in Sioux City. [coins jingle] No, no, Quirt. We can't accept that. What kind of a boarder do you think I am? We cannot do that. We'd tend any wounded man, but not for pay. Huh. You don't believe in force, right? So I guess you can't force me to take it back. [laughing] Thou've been outwitted, Thomas. [Quirt] How long have I been here exactly? [Thomas] Almost two weeks. Huh. I kind of hate to get going. Must you go now? You're still hurt. Ma'am, your cooking has me all healed up. Well... Vaya con dios, amigos. So you're leaving? I got places to go. It wouldn't matter to me where or how far. Oh. I see. I thought you also had feelings. That's not it. It isn't? Well, uh... So you feel the same way, too? Temperance, I'm not the kind of man who... does these things suddenly. So you're just not sure yet. Sort of. [hoofbeats approach] He's all saddled, Quirt. Well, then unsaddle him, son. Does that mean that you're gonna stay? Loredo Stevens owes me $15,000. Can't very well leave without it now, can I? Here you go. A double eagle? Quirt, there's something I'd rather have than this. A favor, a big favor. Well, you can have them both, so what is it? Would you walk past the schoolhouse with me? There's a lot of boys who don't believe I know Quirt Evans. [laughs] Sure. Everybody says that you're the fastest gun in the territory. Well... There are some people who think I'm pretty slow. Thank you. Thank you. [Quirt] Ain't nothing like a Northern Chinook to make a man feel new again. Be sure thee help Grandfather mind the store this morning. There's always work at the store to be done. And who wants to run the store one day? Not anymore I don't. Surely, thee can make it to the store without that. Oh. It balances me. One leg's longer than the other. Thou art a liar. Walk on. What's that all about, Thomas? We're not welcome here in this town. Mayor Carson's trying to make us leave. He's trying to run you out of town? In so many words, yes. I don't know what we're gonna do. Don't talk about this in front of the family. I don't want to upset them. Well, come on. Don't stand around. Give us a hand. I'm not cut out for store work. Fine then. I'll do it. No, no, no. I'll help. But let's just say I'm not signing up for full-time work. Jonathan. Oh, thee... What? Nothing. Just thee. Temperance, could you get some coffee for the storehouse? Yes, Father. So you're gonna run the store one of these days? - I guess so. - [chuckles] Don't sound so excited. Pardon me. Who are those men? I don't know. Can I help you gentlemen? [mocking] Can I help you gentlemen? Ha! We're here to help you. You're supposed to be gone. - This is our home. - Well, homes got a lot pricier. We ain't seen no money yet. We can't afford what you're asking. Is that right? - [groans] - [laughs] Shut up! Your god ain't anywhere near you. It's all right. Let's, uh-- Let's take a break. Why don't you go get yourself some hard candy over at the general store, huh? Really? You'd better get, squirt, before I change my mind. Nowhere, you crazy old bumpkin. [laughing] Is there a problem here, Thomas? D-Don't you mind, Quirt. This doesn't involve you. Um, Quirt Evans? That's right, and if you two sod-busters got a problem with him, well, then it's a problem with me. Uh, no, we got no problem with you, Mr. Evans. Just doing our job. Unless your job is to meet your maker today, I suggest you beat on out of here. Let's go. I ain't gonna get in no gunfight with Quirt Evans. Well, then you're smarter than you look. What did those two men want, Thomas? They're Mayor Carson's men. He owns everything in this town and wants to double our rent. They harass all of us constantly. I told you, they don't want us Quakers in their town. I pray for Steven Carson. You pray for him? Carson doubles your rent, and you pray for him? Can't you see? By committing his evil deeds, the poor man injures his soul. It's not the man's soul I'd be worried about. Where are you going? I have to see someone. [laughing] âª [saloon piano] Well, from the looks of it, you must be Mayor Carson. That is me. We don't need your kind around here. You just keep moving, saddle tramp. This town is not a place for you. Nice hotel. This place must bring in a pretty penny. You heard me. Vamoose. Get out of here, or I'll have my boys throw you out. If by "your boys" you're referring to those two muskrats standing behind me, well... good luck. Carson, it's time you lay off the Quakers. They ain't causing any trouble. They ain't doing anybody any harm, so you just leave them alone. Oh, yeah? And who says so? - Well, I say so. - And who might you be? Quirt Evans. Well, anybody can come by here and say they're Quirt Evans. You're not known here by sight. Anybody could say they're him. Quirt Evans! God, I heard you were in town, too. How I missed you! You rascal, where have you been? - Hello, Maggie. - Don't I even get a kiss? - [clears throat] - Maggie, I kind of got some business right now. Well, then you come down and see me later at the saloon. I will do that. Mayor Carson! Howdy, Mrs. Whart. We've been hoping you'd come by to see us. Thomas? Thomas, come out here! Yes, ma'am. Here I am. Thank you for coming by, Steven. All of us Quakers are grateful to you. Thomas. It was like I was just telling Quirt here. You know, things have been going pretty well for me over at the hotel, and... well, quite frankly, I don't need all that extra money right now, so... why don't we leave the rent where it is. Because I believe that, uh, all the people of the town should be more friendly to your group. You know, be neighborly. Mayor Carson, is that a boil you have there on your neck? Yes, ma'am, it is. Have you tried poultice of eucalyptus to ease it? Ma'am, I have tried everything under the sun. I could lance it for you. Uh... Well, you're not gonna hurt me, are you? Oh, no, no, of course not. You come inside. Oh, that looks like it must hurt awfully. Hurts terrible, ma'am, terrible. Well, looks like all your praying straightened everything right out. You think the gun changed Mayor Carson? Who says I pulled a gun on him? - I do. - Well, I didn't. Ah, well, then he gave in more easily than I expected. The Lord moves in mysterious ways, sometimes using very strange methods. By strange methods, are you referring to me? That's right. Well, if the good Lord's using me to do his work, that'd be strange, all right. Thomas, I cannot tell you how much better this feels. It's incredible! Mayor Carson, I'd like you to have some of my cornbread. It's awfully good with your coffee in the morning. Mmm! Makes me want to go back to the hotel and shoot my cook. Well, you can always come back for more. We've always got plenty. Well, thank you, ma'am. - Goodbye. - Bye, now. - Goodbye, Mayor. - Thomas. Now, that's a real good woman, that mother of yours. Look at that, she fixed my neck. Well, if you excuse me, I think Father wants to give thanks. Oh, I think he's thanked me already. Now I think he'd like to give thanks to someone else. Oh, right. Well, I think I've made peace with my neighbors. It's about time. You know something, I was... I was a little worried about coming out here and seeing these people, but I don't really have a bone to pick with people over God, especially when it smells like this. I'm glad you made me do it. Made me feel good. Thank you, Quirt. You have a good day now, Mayor. I will, if this weather ever lets up. Come on, Danny, let's go. Let's go. Good boy. Good boy, here we go. Well, how bad is dinner gonna be? Oh, just a roast venison and of course a skimpy little chicken. Well, with some cake and some pie, I'll try to make out. Have you killed a lot of people? Stop it! He certainly has not. - How does thee know? - That's enough, John. Friends don't speak of such things. Shall we give thanks? Ah, a new dress. Yes, well, it's first day, or as thou would call it, Sunday. So, will you do us a favor? Certainly. Come with us. Where to? It's a surprise. Whoop! Didn't mean to scare you, ma'am. Hello there, you old weather-beaten hangman. Temperance, this is Sam O'Connell, marshal of this territory. How do? John, go back in the house, thank you. Don't let that gray hair fool you. He's a curly old wolf. I just about had you half-hung. Tall fellow, good with a gun, robbed the Baker stage, killed a couple of folk. Wasn't me. He's been with us the entire time. I'll have to take your word for it, ma'am, 'cause God knows I wouldn't take his. Oh, come on now, Sam, you and I go way back. When are you and Lorado Stevens gonna get around to killing each other? Loredo and I don't have any misunderstandings. As a matter of fact, we just became business partners. Hmm. Well, either way, I'm sure looking forward to hanging the survivor. I ain't got it all figured yet. Like, take this fella here. He was real good with a peacemaker when he was Wyatt Earp's deputy. But then one day, he turns in his badge and starts panning for gold on a nice little piece of land he laid claim on. But out of nowhere, he goes and sells the claim, and then he goes on the prod. Now, why? That's what I ain't got figured. 'Cause round the same time, a fella named Walt Enis goes down in front of Lorado Stevens. Now, he was reaching at the time, but folks say a gambler standing beside him grabbed his hand. Now, is that connected? Only time will tell. [patting] How'd you stand with Walt Enis? I knew him. Do you think... they're connected? I know a lot of people. Ah, well... I'll figure it. I always do. I'm patient. Sometimes things connect. Sometimes they don't. But don't be looking at him with your eyes all bugged out like a cowbird's because there ain't no future in it. So long, Quirt. Make sure you keep a lot of leather wrapped around your hog leg when you're in my town. Stay away from Lorado Stevens. He owes me money. Who knows? I might come out on top. That would be worse. Worse? It'd be worse if I go down than if he goes down? - Of course, then-- - Oh, right. Then I'd be the one with the marred soul. It'd be worse that I couldn't love thee. All right. I won't look up Lorado. Quirt? Whoa. I thought that was you. Randy. Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Whart, this is Randy McCall. How do you do? Well, well, well. And how do you do? Just fine, thank you. - Well, well, well. - You said that before. Don't let us keep you if you're in a hurry. I'm in no hurry. I ain't got no place to go. Well, we do. You could come along with us if you like. That would be nice. Where? To meeting. - To meeting? - To meeting? Yes, to meeting. You don't want to go, do you? It would be nice if you could. We'd be happy to have any friend of Mr. Evans. You would? Well, that'd be fine. You know, ma'am, I sure am an old friend of Quirt's. Matter of fact, I remember a time we were chasing some cattle down by the Lano River, and old Quirt here, when the herd started to stampede, he pulled me out from underneath them. Then there was another time down at Opoe's Palace in San Antone-- [clears throat] We're late. I was just trying to-- Goodbye. You could join us later. It's just on the other side of town. Thank you, ma'am. Walk on. [bell tolls] Friends, as we all know, the purpose of this meeting is threefold. We're trying to raise money for a new meeting house. As always, to give thanks for the goodness that is bestowed upon us. But also to give thanks that we are now going to be able to settle down here in this town. Quirt, please, come up here. We are happy to present you with this token of our friendship for you. This is Quirt Evans. It's because of him that we're gonna be allowed to stay. It provides us with another instance that shows us that all men are good if they are shown the light. He persuaded Steven Carson to let us stay. May I shake your hand, Quirt Evans? May I shake your hand? It was nothing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Quirt. - God bless. - May the Lord bless you. Come on. [Quirt] Take this Bible. Let's get out of here. - A Bible? - Come on, Randy. Oh, brother, this is good readin'. Well, then you can keep it. Just keep moving. Oh. All right. This sure is a book I'm gonna read. - I didn't know you could read. - Listen to this. "Benanaya, the son of Jahodia, slew two men of Moab and killed three lions." - You ready for a drink, Randy? - You bet I am. Just like old times, eh, Quirt? This here wine may be fancier than whiskey, but it sure don't give quick action. Well, to tell you the honest truth, I don't even like it. [giggles] But it is sure fashionable. How do you like it, Maggie? It tickles down, and it's expensive, so I like it. - You sleepy, tall man? - Nope. Worried? Or maybe just plain bored? Not a chance, baby. You can never bore me. Well, I wish I had that in writing. You know, it's been a long time since you told me how my hair reminds you of corn silk. All right. Your hair reminds me of corn silk. All gold and silky? That's right, all gold and silky. You've changed. You're less romantic. You're far away, distant. What happened to you out there? - There was this-- - [clears throat] Take a turn at the wheel. Win yourself a farm in Kansas. I don't want a farm in Kansas. All right then. I'll win you a trip around the world. Miss Maggie, customers are waiting. That's no way to treat customers. Give me a stack of blues. âª You're not the man that I once knew âª âª There's something different about you âª âª The sparkle in your eyes is strange âª âª Your style, your walk your look has changed âª âª You used to smile when you came near âª âª And whisper sweet things in my ear âª âª We couldn't bear to be apart âª âª Now someone else has gotten your heart âª âª I want you still I can't deny âª âª I long for you when you pass by âª âª But something's different about you âª âª You're not the man that I once knew âª âª You're not the man that I âª âª Once knew [applause] 17 black! That's it. I've lost my buttons on my shirt. Cash me out. Bourbon, tall glass. There's no need for barrelling through here like that, friend. I interrupt something? You interrupted a very important conversation between me and my brothers. Gentlemen! Gentlemen, no trouble, please. Just got this place put back together. If I think what's about to happen happens, it's gonna round out a full day. Maggie. That was beautiful. There's your trip. What's eating you, tall man? Did you have words with them Baker brothers? Who? Those three rattlesnakes at the bar. No. 'Cause I heard they like to cause trouble. Well, then maybe I should go apologize. More whiskey. That's it. I'll be right back, I hope. Randy, where the heck you been? Gentlemen, gentlemen, stop this foolishness, please! You don't know what you're doing to me! I've got a family! Get him, Randy! Oh! You get him, you big lout! What are you doing, Randy? I'm sorry, Quirt. - Stop! - Let's get out of here. Count 'em as we throw 'em out. - [punch] - [screaming] That's one! Stop counting. Ah! Oh, honey. I was so afraid you were gonna get hurt. Have a drink. Nice dance. We got money, we got whiskey, we got lovely ladies. We just had a beautiful fight. I tell you, we got to count our blessings. You been reading that Bible again. [Maggie] Now, that's something I thought I'd never see. What? A Bible with your name on it. Here you go, honey. Oh, thank you. [Maggie] Now, tell me something. What's that, Miss Maggie? Where on earth would you get a Bible? Randy, stop him! With what? Where's he going? Has he forgotten something? [giggling] No. We thought you had gone. So did I. What happened to you? [sighs] I've been drinking that demon alcohol again. Come back with us. That's all you need is me as a boarder again. You're always welcome in our home. Thomas, would you give me a hand with those barrels out front? Yeah. So you came back. I had to. I just wanted to see your face again. Why? I don't know exactly. Why did you go away without saying anything? [sighs] I don't know that exactly either. I think it's because I scared you away. I know it sounds strange that I could scare you, but I mean it. I think you thought that... living with me would become tiresome and dull after a while. Hush now. I'm not such a fool, you know. I had a very kind man who was very good to me. And I also know there are people that fall in love and stay together, and there are people that fall in love and don't. I know you're afraid that... I'd tie myself around your neck, and after you got tired of having me, you wouldn't be able to get rid of me. So I made up my mind that if you came back, I would tell you this-- that whatever you want, that's the way it will be. If I go away, you'll come with me? If I go away, you and John would come with me? [rooster crowing] Now, there's something I never thought I'd see. Quirt Evans doing honest work. Your horse is as quiet as you are. I taught him. But I reckon you would've heard if you wasn't working so hard. Haven't you got some real law work to do someplace else? [chuckles] Yeah. I just like to keep track on your whereabouts. You know, Quirt... I always figured on using a new rope when I hang you 'cause I kind of respected you. Mind your own business. I'm trying. It's a shame how things don't turn out the way they should, huh? Take that young lady there. What she should have is a nice young man that knows how to treat her right, who's gonna give her the things that she deserves and not leave her with a legacy of pain and deceit. Well, things aren't always what they seem, so why don't you just move on and leave us alone? Someone that she would always know where he was, who could give her a home, family-- Don't make me angry, Sam. Marshal or not, I'll run your ass off. I ain't never been run off nowhere. I want to stay, I stay. Thing is, I gotta get going. You know, Quirt, you don't rate a new rope with me. Look, Temperance, uh... I've been kicking around a long time. I've got a checkered past. But could a woman like you accept me for who I am, for what I am? I love thee. Did thou accept me? Want to come into town with me? I'm going to... pick up something from the storehouse for Father. Love to. All right, you win. [sighs] Now I know why I don't like being a store clerk. It's too much work. Quirt Evans. Yes, ma'am. I've never said that aloud before. I like the way it sounds. Where'd you get such a name? Well... the man who half-raised me gave it to me. My folks were killed by Indians. His name was Walt Enis. He was downed in a gambling place. He was murdered. It's getting late. We should be heading back. âª âª [man] He ain't strapped. I don't see no gun. [Lorado] Just 'cause you don't see it don't mean it ain't there. Go! Stay away from the door. Please, this won't be solved with violence. Temperance, I don't expect these men are here to pray with me. Come on out, Quirt! Just you and me this time! Fair fight! Right here, right now! You call trying to ambush me a fair fight? Light 'em up. Burn 'em out like a couple of prairie dogs. Think about the woman, Quirt! Temperance, look out! Quirt! [coughing] Nobody'd survive a fire like that. Nobody's getting out of that alive. I need to see a body. If he's dead, I want to see it. The way that fire's blazing, ain't gonna be nothing left, except maybe a gold tooth. Hmph! That there fire would melt gold. We're out of whiskey then, boys. Drinks are on me. Let's warm our bellies at the bar. Feels like this Chinook's coming to an end. [coughing] Thomas, get that doctor! And watch the front and back of the house! Dr. Johnson will sit with her through the night. All we can do now is pray and wait for this storm to pass. How is she? Drink? It's amazing, the varied uses to which men put alcohol. For each different individual, it's either a stimulant, a depressant, or an anodyne. Presently, I am employing it as an anodyne. Get to the point. The practice of medicine is one of the most infuriating professions that have been known to man. Takes 30 years of practice to discover that, in the final analysis, there's nothing you can do but stand back and watch. If she has a lucid moment, you'd better speak to her. I'm not trying to argue you out of anything, but maybe you should stop and think. She wouldn't like this, Quirt. I'm not arguing for or against her point of view, but I know that, to her, the world's worst tragedy would be that you should kill a man. Of course, you could argue logically whether she would know if you killed him or not, but... [sighs] I think... I think she would know. Any discussion has to have at least two participants. Of course, if you refuse to answer me-- Quirt, wait! Don't do this! Come back! I'm sorry, Thomas. I hate to tell you this, but... I think we're about to see a perfect example of "an eye for an eye." Temperance! Temperance, what are you doing out of bed? Thou art very ill, dear. We must stop him. If you don't stay in bed, young lady... Her fever's down. I don't know if I believe in miracles, but this is one lucky little lady. He needs us, Father. Mother. Yeah, Lorado gave me this beating. Look at that. Wait'll Quirt hears about this. Boy, oh, boy. He will have something to say about it, believe you me. Why, I wouldn't be surprised if Mister-- Mr. Evans? You know Lorado Stevens? Yes, sir, I do. He's in the saloon with dirt-buster Hondo, sir. You're going to take him a message. Let's drink a toast... to the late Quirt Evans. I wouldn't get excited just yet. Please, gentlemen, I don't want any more trouble. I'm-- I'm just carrying a message. Yeah? He's waiting. And who would that be? Quirt Evans. Oh, hell. I'm gonna kill that pilgrim for sure this time. He also wants me to buy you a bottle of whiskey. For what? Says you're gonna need to drink at least half the bottle to get up the nerve to come outside. You want me to kill this here tenderfoot just to get warmed up, Boss? Easy, Hondo. You keep your money, mister. I'll be back in here in one minute, and you can buy us all a drink. Whoa. Quirt! Quirt! Temperance... Killing you's gonna be real easy, just like it was killing Enis. He got drunk, shot his mouth off. How else would I have known about that claim? [click] Ain't much dignity in killing an unarmed man, Lorado. I wouldn't expect even you to stoop that low. Watch me stoop. [Marshal] Nothing ever turns out right. I was onto them from the beginning. They robbed the stage and committed a slew of other crimes, but if you had have downed them, I'd have had to hang you. Things don't ever turn out the way they should. But I'm still here. You just keep on with your old ways. It's only a matter of time till I hang you. Not me, Marshal. Oh, yeah? That's right. Then I guess you don't care about that mineral claim you wired into the land office at Fort Lansing a little while back. What are you talking about? Well... now that Lorado don't own that deed, and since you were forced to sign under suspicious circumstances, I reckon that you are probably the rightful owner of that property now. You don't say. I do say. I reckon you're a very rich man, Quirt Evans. You don't say. You'll be able to look after that lovely lady of yours and her family. Well, it just goes to figure, don't it? What's that? The day I become the richest man in Oregon is the day I don't need it anymore. Yeah.
