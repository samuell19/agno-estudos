[instrumental music] [sighs] Carl? I'm so sorry. We should be a family. You know that. I'm so sorry... for everything. Please forgive me. [clattering] I'm a great mom. I'm a great mom. [keys jingling] I'm a great mom. [engine rumbling] [scoffs] Guess I'll be adding that to the list. [cell phone ringing] Hey, Doug, what's up? Again? You just got back. It's fine, it's fine, um... She's getting ready for her big day tomorrow anyway. Here she is. [sighs] Hey, Dad. Listen, I'm-I'm afraid that I can't see you this weekend. I've gotta go to Chicago. Oh... Okay. [Doug] But when I get back, we'll do whatever you wanna do, okay? Uh, yeah, yeah. I'll see you when you get back. I love you, sweet pea. Love you too. Bye. [sighs] You okay? I'm fine. Like you said, I gotta get ready for my big day tomorrow. [indistinct chatter] Getting excited? No. Come on, it's your first day. No? You're nervous. [female announcer] Seniors, just a friendly reminder... - Hey, don't play with... - Ha, I'm sorry. Stop. ...prom tickets are still available. So, where is this front office? - I don't know. - Any idea? - You looking for the office? - Yes. - It's this way. - Thank you. You gotta be careful. You've got that new mom scent. Her last school was dr off and go, so I'm not used to such heavy parental involvement. Oh, you have no idea. - I'm Suki. - Hi. Mandy. This is Riley. - Ninth grade? - Yeah. I've got one in ninth grade too. - Oh. - Zailey. Mandy Wallace. - Yes. - Good luck. Olivia Peterson. - Hi. - Momager of the team. Coach Shaw couldn't make it, so I'm your welcoming committee. And you must be Riley. Aren't you gorgeous? This is my daughter Chelsea. She's into gymnastics too. So, my mom said you just moved here. Yeah, from the city. Is that where you got those boots? Yeah, from Wicker Street. See, Mom, people do shop there. Ah, I'm such a mean mom. [Mandy laughs] Coach Shaw asked me to give you these before practice. Uh, Riley's not sure she wants... No. Um, I'll go. Why don't you take Riley to Homeroom? You can't be late on your first day. I'll pick you up after practice. [school bell rings] Looks like she's right at home here. You're a lifesaver. Things were pretty shaky on the way over. Oh, teenagers. So, I've heard great things about this school. Yeah, it's great. We have our issues, too. Like cliques, for example. With a group of high school kids, isn't that kind of unavoidable? I was talking about the moms... Madam President. ...of the PTA. You really need to talk to Principal Marcus again about the dress code. Because I don't want my husband seeing that when he drops Paige off for school. 'Cause he gets plenty of that when he's watching online porn. Ah. These are my girls. Colleen and Reyna. Hi, I'm Mandy. Mandy's one of us. Well, except for being impeccably dressed at 8:00 a.m. Don't worry, Olivia will help you with that. Come on, I'll show you around. Thanks. [Jill] So, how's Havenhurst? [Mandy] It's good so far, everyone's really welcoming. - Great, good. - Yeah. So... Tell me about this, uh, account that you landed. You're never gonna believe it. - What? - Oh, thank you, Sarah. Um, Health Corp Global. You're kidding me. You're kidding me! They stay with their ad agency for years. I know, I'm still pinching myself. Oh, my gosh. So, they want a multi-platform campaign to get into the family market. And I want you to write lead copy. - I would love to. - Yes. [laughs] Um, is it okay if I still work from home, though? I mean, with the move, and with Riley and everything, it's just... Absolutely. No explanation needed. - Okay. - Take a look at the file. - And we'll strategize. - Mm-hmm. Sounds good. - But first, coffee. - Yes. Hi, uh, these bulbs keep burning out. Is thenother brand that I could try? - Um, let me go check. - Thanks. My guess is there's something wrong with your fixture. Said the strange man behind you. [both chuckle] Um, is there somewhere that I can find a new fixture around here? Something on the off-beat side? - On the off-beat side? - Mm-hmm. Um... There's a store called "Feather Your Nest" on Main. It's got some pretty eclectic stuff. Okay. Thanks, I'll check it out. [cell phone ringing] Uh, pardon me. - Hi. - Hey, mama. I was just about to head to practice. Doesn't that end at six? Oh, we always go early. You should come hang out, the girls just love having groupies. Uh, I'm not really sure that Riley fits in that category. Chelsea was resistant at first, but... since I started showing up, we have gotten... so close. Alright, what the hell, um, give me fifteen. - Actually, make that twenty. - Great, see you there. Okay, bye. Thanks. - Whoa. - Whoo! Chelsea is amazing. Number one. Star of our team. She's definitely gonna make it to state this year. My Paige, however, is a disaster. Please, mine is the biggest disaster. - Taylor, stop slouching. - Okay, Riley. - Show us what you got. - Oh, Riley's up next. [Mandy] Uh, she's just getting back into it. She took eight months off. [Coach Shaw] Really great job, Riley. [Colleen] Wow, she's really good. [Reyna] Do you think she's better than Chelsea? [Colleen] Yeah, I think so. [thudding] Uh. [sighs] I think it was too soon for her to try to tackle that. She'll nail it next time. - Yeah. - Nice work, ladies. [Coach Shaw] Let's take five. Mom, what are you doing here? You know, just hangin' with the moms. [Coach Shaw] Mrs. Wallace. I'm Eileen Shaw. Mandy, please. It's so great to finally meet you. Riley has magnificent form. Now, I know why she placed so high in her division. Well, it's nice to see her out there having fun again. Riley, wow, you're really good. Are you girls reading that ridiculous blog again? The "Pain Inside" blog. A teen writes anonymously about her pain-filled life. [Olivia] The girls are obsessed with it. "I feel so much pressure to be perfect all the time." Why do you read this garbage? It's not garbage. And it's not just us. The "Pain Inside" blog has more than one million followers. - Wow. - Yeah. She writes from the dark place of inner pain. It's so cool. Okay, that's enough, ladies. I'm sure Mandy doesn't want Riley reading a bunch of nonsense. But it's real. Girls, on the mat, please, let's get back to work. Okay. Hey, Suki. Is Zailey on the team? Yeah, that's Zailey. Oh, I saw her on the bars, she's wonderful. Does she do privates? I know a lot of moms do that for the girls. Keep your distance from them. It won't end well. It never does. Mom, Chelsea invited me to have a sleepover. Please, please, please, please. - Please? - Not tonight. Please, we promise we'll go to bed a decent time. Riley, it's been a really long day, okay? And what better way to end it than with a strong martini? Besides, when's the last time you went out with the girls? - Well... - Don't bother. I already know the answer to that. [laughs] Come on. Okay. Ugh, let's go. Mandy, this is my husband Beau. Beau, this is Mandy. He can take the girls. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mandy. - Hi, thank you for doing this. - Hi. [chuckles] No, it's no trouble. I'm just gonna go check on the girls. Okay. He's well-trained. [both chuckle] Come on, let's go drop off our cars. I'll spring for a driver so that we can drink. Alright then. [Olivia] Welcome to Havenhurst Country Club. [Mandy sighs] This place is incredible. I know, right? My home away from home. I wish this was my home away from home. [Olivia chuckles] I know, it's pretty great. [Mandy sighs] Olivia. Such a tragedy, what happened to Ginny. Oh, look, Colleen and Reyna beat us here. I'll be right there. [indistinct chatter] Hi. Holly Rosten. President of the Board. She loves cornering Olivia. I wonder what she's gossiping about this time. Ginny. Another mom? She was a total mess. Drinking. Popping pills. Sleeping around. She lost custody of her kids. Husband left her. How awful. I'm surprised you don't know about this. The realtor didn't care to share your home's unfortunate history? What do you mean? Honey, you're living in her house. You know nothing was happening between Ginny and Beau. We all know Ginny's past. It's hard to believe she didn't try. She made a mistake. And now, her children will live without a mother. But I guess that's on your conscience. Hm. Kinda like it's on your conscience how your daddy bribes his way into government contracts. Guess it would be rough-going if that income stream dried up. It was so great catching up. - Ha. - Hey. You guys ordered me a martini. Fabulous. So, how long have you guys been coming here? Since we were kids, Olivia was a member and Colleen was her plus-one. And Reyna was her charity case. [Colleen laughs] Hi. Can we get a round of your best champagne? Oh, no, no, none for me. I, I'm a lightweight. Don't be silly, I got us a driver. It's like you had this whole thing planned out. [Olivia laughs] I'm gonna do whatever I need to do to get you to have fun. [Mandy laughs] What I wouldn't give to put that cute waiter in a doggy bag for later. [all laughing] So, Mandy, I'm curious. Why'd you decide to move here in the middle of the school year? Your husband get a new job? Uh, no, I'm divorced. Oh, I, I didn't know. No, it's fine, um... Tsk, I love the area, and I, I figured it was as good a time as any. Two months before the end of the school year? Yeah, a little jarring for Riley, isn't it? Okay, alright, ladies. Her daughter's having no issues adjusting. Enough with the inquisitions, jeez. Ah, perfect timing. A toast to Mandy. Welcome to Havenhurst. - Welcome. - Welcome. - Hm. - Oh, that's good. Hey. I'm sorry about Colleen and Reyna. They have zero tact. It's okay. It's just hard to talk about, you know? It's been so complicated. Yeah. Well... I'm here for you. Whatever you need. We have to look out for each other. Being a mom can be... so lonely. Ugh, tell me about it. I'm just trying so hard to keep everything together. I hardly get time for friends. Everyone needs a friend to confide in. Truth is, um... I moved here to get Riley out of her old school. [Olivia] Oh, yeah? She was, um, suspended for drugs. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. The thing that hurts the most is I missed all the signs. She dropped out of gymnastics, her favorite thing in the world. She became secretive. A pair of my earrings went missing. You can't blame yourself. And the whole time, my husband's cheating on me. [sighs] You deserve so much better. Thanks. Hey. You should do things that make you happy. I was hoping to start by writing again. Are you talking about "Mandy's Mom Adventures"? How do you know about my blog? [chuckles] More people should know about it. And I wanna help you. I was in a preschool playgroup with May Cummings, do you know who that is? The parenting guru. She's amazing. Yeah. I can reach out to her and see what she thinks. If it's okay with you. I would be way okay with that. Good. Like I said, we've gotta look out for each other. [driver] Here we are, ladies. Alright, I'll see you at 7:00. Wait, I thought the PTA meeting was at 8:30. Yoga. I'll swing by and pick you up. Fine. Hey, Olivia, um... Please don't tell anyone what I said about Riley. I just... wouldn't want it to get out. Don't worry, I never would. "Nietzsche." "Property of Ginny Renlow." Wow. "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process, he does not become a monster. And when you look long into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you." Phew. She was unhinged. [knocking on door] Morning, how'd the girls do? Oh, like two peas in a pod. [Mandy laughs] I brought you a few things. Oh, thanks. Come in. Oh, yoga clothes. You sure you don't want these? I was about to donate them to charity but then I thought that they would be perfect for you. Thanks. - Oh, I, I didn't mean... - No, no. I'm just teasing you, I don't mind your hand-me-downs. This is cute. Yeah, why don't you try it on and see if it fits? Okay, I'm gonna change my bra. Just, uh, help yourself to some more coffee. Okay. [instrumental music] Oh, cute. Yep, that's perfect. [sighing] Hey, girls. Oh, hey, um... I left my cell phone in the car. Can I borrow your keys? Just in case Riley calls. - Yeah. - Thanks. You didn't say Mandy was coming. I didn't say she wasn't. Hey, does your cousin still need referrals? That lawsuit really took a toll, didn't it? We wouldn't want his business bottoming out. Do you have anything to add, Reyna? - No? - Hey. - Hi. - Thanks. Hop on. We're in the front row. Trust me, you wanna be near Raphael when he does downward dog. [chuckles] [Olivia] The PTA bake sale was a hit. And before we finally dive into fundraising goals, I wanna introduce you all to Mandy Wallace. Hi, everyone. [Olivia] Mandy writes copy for an ad agency and has the most charming mommy blog. So, she's the perfect person to handle marketing for our spring fair, if you're up for it. - Sure, I'm happy to help. - Fabulous. As most of you know, Suki was handling the marketing but too much responsibility with Zailey and being a working mom, and... Oh, wait. Most of the moms work here too. [laughing] Why don't we take a break before we move on to fundraising, okay? - Hi. - Hey, Colleen. Did you get my message? Mess... Yes, yes. Uh, I agree, her dad is a bit overzealous. Overzealous? I thought he was gonna punch out that raft. I know. Hey there. - Hi. - Did you find your fixture? Uh, you know, it's on the to-do list. Okay. Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt. Oh, no, no, no, we're just... trashing another dad, as usual. - My name's Ellis. - Hi. Mandy. - Mandy. - Uh. Ellis is our resident architect. He did the brilliant design for our new wing. You should walk Mandy through it. We may need to pull her into marketing down the line. Well, actually, I have to stop by Feather Your Nest on Sunday, you wanna... Oh, you're booked. Chelsea's birthday party. - The moms are invited. - Oh. Can you do Monday? Say, late morning? Perfect. Perfect it is. I'm looking forward to it. Sure. The hot PTA dad. I saw him checking you out. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I guess she's not so broken up about that divorce anymore. I guess not. Yes. Great job, Riley. Alright, ladies, listen up. For the meet on Monday... Chelsea, you're in first position. Riley, number two. Number two. - Fantastic. - Yeah. You and Riley have to celebrate. Oh, I wouldn't want to put too much pressure on her. I'll be back. Hey, Suki. Uh, do you have a second? I already gave you my advice. I just wanna let you know that I took on marketing for the spring fair. But you're welcome to do it. [scoffs] Trust me. The PTA is the farthest thing from my mind. Uh, hey. Uh, Zailey's, uh, crying in the bathroom. She's upset because she didn't get invited to Chelsea's birthday. I tried talking to her, but, um... I just thought you should know. Meet you in the car. Sure. I'm the bad guy here. I rented out a high-end salon for Chelsea's birthday and I told her she had to limit the number. Then, you know girls, friends one day, enemies the next. Kind of like you and Ginny. Look, I know it's none of my business. Um... But I live in Ginny's house, you know? Yeah, um... We were friends. Or at least, I thought we were. And then, things got weird. Weird how? She just... sort of lost it. She spiraled out of control, and... developed, like, an unhealthy obsession with me. I tried to help her, but... I guess I didn't help her enough. But... the past is in the past. Let's go get the girls. Sounds good. When's dinner? Soon, uh... Don't fill up on junk. Uh, hey, Riley, have you seen my watch? No. I thought I left it on the counter this morning. You sure you didn't see it? I wasn't here. I stayed over at Chelsea's, remember? Okay. It was a question, not an accusation, okay? Uh-huh, smile and nod. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. New topic. Okay. So, what do you know about Zailey? Uh... I know she's got issues. Yeah, what kind of issues? Um... She's a cutter. Oh, my God. So, Chelsea stopped being friends with her for that? I have no idea. Paige was the one who told me about it. But when you have problems, that's when you need your friends the most. Why are you lecturing me about this? [scoffs] It's not like we were friends. Anyways, Chelsea's really nice. Forget it. I'm gonna go finish my homework. Riley! What? [sighs] [gasps] Riley! Jeez. Are you okay? Yeah, I just can't finish my homework. Which, I'm sure, you're heartbroken about. You bet. Hey, you know, Dad didn't call tonight like he said he would. [sighs] I'm sorry, honey. You're always sorry, Mom. Sorry you had to come in on a Saturday. Oh, don't be silly, I got buttloads of work to do anyway. [Mandy chuckles] And... I am so excited for you. Health Corp Global is seriously talking about sponsoring. Okay, are we really talking about "Mandy's Mom Adventure"? Yes. Because my blog has a total of 12 followers. Not anymore, my friend. You blew up overnight. Check it out. - I have 90,000 followers? - Ninety. - Ninety thousand? - Thousand. Ninety thousand. [laughs] What the hell? Getting May Cummings to champion your blog was a brilliant move. Ah, yes. Well, I have a, a really great connection. Mm, thank that connection, and then some. This is big time, Mandy. Yeah. - Oh, yeah. - This place is nice, huh? [female #1] Oh, she's doing great... - Hey. - Hi. Welcome to Chelsea's party. - Wine for moms. - Oh, thank you. Mocktails for girls. Hey, why don't you take Riley to the back so she could pick out a dress? Okay. I'm so glad you're here. Mandy, we're all getting facials with Katerina. You need that new power blogger glow. [laughs] I can't thank you enough, I have a huge meeting with a sponsor next week. - Health Corp Global. - That's amazing. Never heard of them. That's because the only food you eat is fried. Hey, Mom. [Olivia] Oh, wow, oh, don't you look gorgeous? Careful, Riley, it's a loan. Oh, no, please, it's a party favor. Olivia, that's too much, seriously. Relax, I only go all out once a year. Besides, it's technically all on Colleen's account anyway. She gets a family discount. This is my sister's place. Don't worry, Olivia will pay me back... with interest. Mandy, you should take a picture with Riley. She looks beautiful. Oh, yeah, do you mind? Not at all. Say, "Cheese." Super duo. [Olivia] Ah, gorgeous. Can I come in? Yeah, come on in. What's on your mind? I'm sorry I've been giving you a hard time. Riley... I am. I just... I really like it here. I'm glad to hear that. 'Cause we're not moving again... ever. [announcer] Riley Wallace. [applause] [cheering] [announcer] 9.33. Chelsea Peterson. [indistinct chatter] She's good. [gasping] [gasping] [applause] [male announcer] 6.83. - Oh, no. - That doesn't look good. Poor Chelsea. So, everyone knows we have our qualifier for state coming up. So, make sure that you practice every chance you get, understand? [all] Yes, coach. Uh, Chelsea, Riley, can you stay for just a sec? Yeah. Chelsea, I'm gonna try you out in second position and Riley, I'm gonna put you in first position... But Chelsea's always first for the team, Coach. Mom, really, it's fine. No, um... shall we see what the principal has to say about this? Well, actually, this is my decision, not Principal Marcus'. I apologize, Coach. That is not what I meant to say. I honestly just think I should have spent more time with you discussing this so I could understand. Maybe we can have dinner tonight at the country club. Oh, well, sure, that sounds good. Great. So, ladies, go home, get some rest. And if you want to go to state, moms, I need those completed drug testing forms. Let me see it, I'm so proud! [chuckles] Come on, hold it up. Hold it up, hold it up. [camera clicks] How did you like that extra backhand spring that Riley did? That is Chelsea's signature move. I guess Mandy decided to exert pressure on her after all. I guess so. The most obnoxious part was when Mandy goes, "Poor Chelsea." She said that? Mom. This is... this is, like, nothing. Oh, well... Maybe if you were lighter on your feet, you'd have better balance. What's that supposed to mean? We own a scale. Olivia, are you serious right now? Do you have any idea how much money we've poured into training and summer programs? Hm? I expect more than half-assed beam work. Riley's better than me, okay? So deal with it. She's only had four years of training and she can do everything I can. Yeah. Like that signature backhand spring you taught her. She's only your friend so she can manipulate you. And you are too much of a sap to see it. You are just jealous because I have a real friend. [sighs] [sighs] "The road..." [sighs] "The road isn't always easy. So, stop... and celebrate hard work... and its sweet rewards." [Olivia] What else do we have to discuss? Um... Ah, yes, so, can I get a quick update on the spring fair from co-chair Colleen? We have Tasty Spoon and Sushi Nozawa on board for booths. And I have a couple feelers out to boutiques. Uh, what else? Marketing. - Oh, I got a page set up... - Oh, sorry to interrupt. Um, I set up a page as well since I thought I was handling marketing. Something happened? I will explain to you afterwards. Just a few minutes. Sure. Moving on to facilities. How's the renovation going? Ellis. Oh, sorry, uh, needy client. Renovations are, uh, going along on schedule, and no new drawings necessary. Excellent. Then, if there's nothing else, we are adjourned. So, Suki was really upset. Whatever you said to her, she was... Said about what? You know, the marketing. Well, we never spoke about marketing, so that makes no sense. Relax, I'm not attacking you. I'm happy to do something else. How about I follow up with the boutiques? That's handled. But maybe we could find something else for you down the line. That's fine, I'm up to my eyeballs with my blog, anyway. That's right. You must be so busy with your blog. We wouldn't want to overwhelm you. - Hey. - Hey. You still have time for Feather Your Nest today? - Absolutely. - Yeah? - Yeah. - How about now? - Let's go. - Let's go. [Mandy] This place has stuff from every decade. [chuckles] Ah, there's one for you. Oh. Really, it doesn't get any worse. My ex brought an exact replica of that home. Wow. Okay. Well, I give her points for bravery. My ex was never satisfied with anything that I brought home. Is he a designer? No, um, he is a lawyer. But, um, a control freak. Ooh. Well, that's a bit more than I wanted to spend. And I need to lock down that deal with that sponsor so I can spend a bit more on fixtures. - I'll tell you what. - Hm. Why don't you take a picture of it and post it on your blog, and I will talk to the owner about a, uh... a 40 percent architect discount. Oh. I like the way you think. Can I treat you to lunch? You're in luck. I never turn down a meal. [chuckles] It's good to know. How did you end up in the PTA? Uh, Olivia said she needed help with the plans for the new wing. She's very persuasive. Yeah, that she is. She's also the reason why my blog is doing so well. And, um, the girls really hit it off which matters more than anything. Sure, yeah, your kid's happy you're happy, I know that. Uh... I was just curious... Did something happen with Suki? I mean, she seems like she used to be more involved. Well, I don't know for sure, she just said that she had some personal issues but she didn't go into any detail. Well, Colleen was just, was trashing her at the meeting, so I had to wonder. Of course, Colleen trashes everyone. You've no idea what I'm talking about, do you? - Probably not, you know. - Ha-ha-ha. Uh, apart from helping with the designs, I'm really there to just fulfil... Yeah, yeah, yeah, that you're the hot dad quota. "The hot dad quota"? I was about to say, the, the token dad quota, but I will take that. I'm so embarrassed. I can see that, I like that. - I think I'm gonna milk it. - Just stop. - I'm gonna milk it. - Stop. Stop. Your cheeks are getting about as pink as that strawberry. [chuckles] Mm-mm. Okay, I will stop if you will agree to accompany me to this art gallery opening coming up. - Mm. - I would love to have a... Well, uh, frankly, a very beautiful, uh, distraction from all the pretentious designers. Well, you're in luck. I never turn down a gallery opening. Fantastic. - Cheers. - Cheers. - You're just gonna love her. - Thank you so much, I... And there she is. Amanda Wallace, meet Leonard Harbinger VP of marketing for Health Corp Global. It's so great to meet you. We're crazy about "Mandy's Mom Adventures." I'm crazy about your company. - Thank you. - Please. Our lawyers are putting together a proposal for sponsorship. I'm thrilled to hear that. Uh, what I wanted to talk about today are suggestions for redesigns to fit our brand. Absolutely. Great. Let me pull it up. I've never got such a spiteful comment, ever. This is strange. There was nothing negative when I was looking through it earlier. Hm. "Check out her daughter's blog." My daughter doesn't have a blog. There's a link. Probably to some porn site in the Czech Republic. - "Pain Inside." - You know it? Yeah, it's a really popular blog, apparently. - So, your daughter wrote it? - No, of course not. "I had to steal pills just to get through the day." My daughter had nothing to do with this, I promise you. You sure? I know my daughter. Obviously, someone's trying to make it look like she posted this. I understand there's been some issues in the past. - With Riley? - What? [Leonard] Look, we're a multimillion-dollar company, Miss Wallace. We have a major reputation to uphold. So, we research people we might be doing business with very carefully. Full background check, the whole works. Mr. Harbinger, I can vouch for Mandy, and... That's not necessary, I... I have seen and heard enough. Mr. Harbinger, please. This... website was up long before we got here. I'm sorry, but we have to make sure we place our products in a conflict-free environment. I wish you the very best with your blog. Damn it. - Mr. Harbinger... - Jill, please. Please wait. I am so, so, sorry. Do you think you can save the deal? I don't know. I'll try. Thanks for coming over. Martinis, the cure-all. So, everyone has been reacting to the initial post. It's like a Trash "Mandy's Mom Adventure" free-for-all. I'm sorry. "Hey, Mandy, why don't you spend more time with your daughter and less time posting about her?" "If I was her daughter, I'd be pissed, too." "A mom profiting off her daughter." I haven't earned a single penny from this blog. These people need to get a life. I mean, come on, you must have to laugh at it. Yeah, I may need 12 more of these. Hm. It's like they're shaming me, you know? Mom-shaming. I'm the worst mom ever. You believe that? That I'm the worst mom ever? God, I hope not. No. That Riley didn't write it. Of course, she didn't. Did Riley say something to Chelsea? No. No. Are you sure? Did she suggest anything? Olivia, I need to know. [exhales] Look. You told me how Riley had a hard time before. Being secretive. - Your watch went missing. - My watch? - It wasn't my watch, - Oh, I, uh, I thought that... No, I said it was a pair of earrings. How did you know my watch was missing? You told me. Wow, you are really losing it. Seriously, you have to relax. I'm on your side. [grunts] [keys clacking] [Mandy] It's a question, not an accusation, okay? [Riley] Uh-huh, smile and nod. [creaking] [exhales] Jesus. Riley, you scared me. That's pretty clear. I thought you were having pizza with the team. I was. Coach Shaw just dropped me off. What are you doing in my room? Were you on my laptop? Yes. Why? Did you write the "Pain Inside" blog? What? No. Someone made a comment on "Mandy's Mom Adventures" and linked you to it. [scoffs] Some random person wrote a comment on your stupid blog, and you think it's true? It's bookmarked to your laptop, Riley. That's private, Mom. You have no right to snoop. I have a right to be concerned, I'm your mother. And if there's a sign of anything, I will be speaking to you about it. [scoffs] It's bookmarked because I read it. Taylor, Chelsea, Paige, and plenty of other girls at school read it too. But I didn't write it. Okay. So you believe me now? - We're good? - Yes, I believe you. Riley, I just got so scared. Things were really bad for you before and I don't wanna go back. You think I do? That's not what I meant. Just leave. Please. [thudding] [instrumental music] [sighs] [sighs] Oh, what's happening to me? [Mandy] Riley. Hon? [cell phone rings] Hi, Jill. Hey, so, I spoke with legal about the situation and they suggest that you shut down the blog. - For just a little while. - Uh, for how long? I don't wanna jeopardize things with Health Corp Global. You couldn't save the deal. It's gotten really complicated for them. Okay, um, that's fine, I can, um, put the blog on hold, and then I will just write copy for the ad campaign. Are you kidding me? They're taking me off the campaign, too? We're gonna find something else for you, I promise. Okay, uh, if it's best. You just, you gotta give me time. I'm gonna put out some feelers. Put out feelers? Am I being fired? Health Corp Global is a really important client. I had nothing to do with this. My daughter didn't write that blog. [Jill] I know. I-I know. I've been working for you for ten years, Jill. I'm raising a kid on my own, I... I really need you to back me up. You know, a call's coming in. I'm-I'm so sorry, I gotta go. Okay. [breathes heavily] [shaky breathing] [exhales] - I can't believe she did that. - She is a terrible mother. Oh, she's a drunk. [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [door opens] - Hey. - Hey. Did you get that info I sent you about the gallery opening? Um, I haven't had a chance to look at it yet. Yeah, it doesn't matter. We should go anyway. Is it okay if we get together in a few weeks? - Things are... - In a few weeks? It's a little complicated right now. What's up? Sorry, I just, um... I'm not sure I feel like talking about it. Well, why don't we go to my place? No, I'm-I'm... Just to talk, it's very close. I make a mean latte. - Okay. - Okay. There you are, milady. That is the best no-foam latte in town. Thanks. So, is there any chance that your ex wrote the initial post... No, no, no, he's not a vindictive guy. But I wouldn't put it past Colleen or Olivia. Olivia? I thought you said Olivia was the reason your blog took off. Well, she was, but... - But what? - I just realized something. Um... That was before. Before Riley nabbed the top spot in gymnastics and knocked Chelsea off her perch. I don't know, that sounds a little too... What? Manipulative? She manipulates everything and everyone. Uh, no, I was gonna say a little too, uh, convenient. But... I don't know. If you want, I have a friend in IT who can track down the computer who sent the initial post. Even if the site is down? That's no problem. Is there something else? Seems like there is. Oh, it's just that, um, I got this note the other day... that said I was gonna end up like Ginny. - Ginny Renlow? - Yeah. Did you know her? Well, the rumor was she killed herself. - Because she couldn't be with... - Let me guess. Olivia's husband Beau. - Am I right? - Yeah. How did you... No, doesn't matter. - You need to call the police. - And say what? That I got a generic blank envelope and a typed note? Well, is there at least somewhere you can go until this whole blog thing blows over? Riley's just getting settled in, so... Even if there was somewhere to go, I just... I wouldn't want to disrupt her again, you know? Yeah. If there is anything I can do... Well, you've done more than enough, so... Thank you. You know what? I should go. I have taken up way too much of your time. You've been amazing. Thanks. You're pretty amazing yourself. I can't believe you're saying that, I am such a wreck. Well... I like wrecks. I'm sorry, um... I just, I just need some more time. Well, of course, yeah. Yeah, I'm a patient man. [both chuckle] Thanks. Ugh, that's so tacky, always have one. [Colleen] Wow, apparently, it's always a good time for a mid-morning quickie. - Hm. - Olivia is going to love this. Are you sure you wanna tell Olivia? I mean, it's just such a small thing. What's wrong with you? [sighs] Dad's meeting is running late. He's not gonna be able to make it. Well, you know how busy work is for him. You'll see him next weekend. Riley, great, you're here. - Hurry up and get changed. - Yeah. - Oh, oh, and Riley? - Yes, Coach? Chelsea will be back in first position for state, okay? Sure, no worries. Hey, wait... That's my watch. - What, this? - Yeah. That's my watch. No, this was a gift. Let me guess, from Olivia? Mandy apparently thinks that I swiped her watch to give it to you. I loved your watch, so I ordered one and had it engraved. Show her. It was a gift from all of us gymnastics moms. I guess you missed the e-mail. I, uh... I apologize. No problem, Mandy. - Why don't you take a seat? - Sure. [indistinct chatter] Okay, what's going on? There's a rumor that you're hitting on all the married men. What? That's ridiculous! [scoffs] Do you know who started the rumor, Colleen? Or should I be asking if you were the one who started it? Oh, please. I find it awfully ironic, since you're the one who throws yourself at any man in your vicinity. That is called flirting. I'm not screwing them. I didn't do that. That's a complete lie. - Okay. - Ladies. Let's not distract the girls from warming up for the competition. Mandy, let's take a walk. [indistinct chatter] Mandy, you're bringing this on yourself. The whole thing with Ellis. What thing with Ellis? Colleen and Reyna saw you getting out of his car today. We're spending time together. That's none of anyone's business. Mandy... He's married. No. No, he's divorced. Ask him. - Look, if I had known... - If you had known? You're the one who scheduled the date. To hang out with him. - As friends. - "As friends." Give me a break. I never would have encouraged you to be involved with a married man. This is a small community. That kind of thing rubs people the wrong way. It's like you set this whole thing up. To what, pull out the rug and turn everyone against me? - It's just like my blog. - What are you talking about? You know, those martinis whipped up pretty quick. Or maybe they were already chilled. [scoffs] I have been nothing but generous to you. Blaming me for what Ellis did... that's unfair. [indistinct chatter] Hey, you. Apparently, Riley's dad can't make it, so I'm gonna sub in. You okay? I was. Until I found out you were married. I'm not married. So, you're divorced? No, I'm separated. So, you're really st... You're still married. No, no, I'm getting divorced. It's... It's taking a long time, uh, for the two of us to agree on a settlement. Information that would've been very helpful to know. Uh, uh, hold on. Where is this really coming from? People who are separated date all the time. Do they have kids at the same school? Ellis, my ex had an affair. I don't take this issue lightly. Or did Olivia not tell you that part when she set us up? What the hell are you talking about? What is this obsession you have with Olivia? [sighs] Alright, I'm sorry, I should've told you. You're right, but you have so much else going on. And now, I have even more going on because everyone's talking about this. I really didn't need this. I'm sorry. Yeah. So am I. Pay now. [exhales] I'll get to you later. Oh, God. Pay... I don't know when. [glass shatters] Mom? Did you hear that? - What's happening? - Stay here. [brakes screeching] Mom? Riley, I told you to stay... Just go in the house, I'm gonna call the police. Hi, uh, yes, I'm calling to report an incident of vandalism. Yeah, um, somebody smashed the window of my car and, uh, tagged my house. No, um, I-I don't know the license plate. I didn't chase the car down, I was making sure my daughter was safe. I know, I know, I'm trying to calm down, I just... Please send someone as soon as you can. Okay. Mom? [sighs] Mom, wake up. We're gonna be late, it's after seven. [scoffs] Really? Mm, just give me a second. Ugh. [sighs] Riley... You are so unbelievably talented. And that's why it's so hard for me to tell you that your drug test came back positive. What? Th not possible. Yeah, painkillers. OxyContin. I didn't do it. Let me see the test results. [Riley] I swear I didn't do it. This must be a false positive. She has to be retested. The lab tests and retests to make sure that can't happen. I don't even know where to get OxyContin. What are the consequences? So you believe her? No, Riley, I'm just trying to understand what we're up against, okay? If she won't be able to participate in state, she's off the team. She's also suspended from school until Principal Marcus can decide if wants to take any further action. Not before I hire a lawyer. We're not trying to punish you, Riley. We really wanna try and help her get the help that she needs. I, um... understand that she had a problem at her last school. What? Riley, go outside. I need to speak to Coach Shaw alone for a minute. This is ridiculous. How did you know that Riley had a problem at her last school? I heard about it from her former coach. She called me. Her former coach isn't a she, it's a he. Coach Bill Hall. Wha... My mistake, you know? I talk to so many different people. I think the person that you talked to was Olivia. She's the only one who knows what happened to her at her last school. Look, she might have said something, but... It makes it much easier to believe that Riley failed her drug test if you know her history. Okay, hold on. Just because she... And knocking Riley out of gymnastics is a great way to ensure that Chelsea shines at state. Bottom line. It's impossible. We use an outside laboratory. There is no way she could have had anything to do with this. Nothing is impossible for Olivia. Hey, Riley. I heard what happened. What are you worried about? You have state all to yourself now. How could you even say that? I've been your biggest cheerleader. Really? Then how come you told Coach what happened at my old school? I didn't. [Paige] What a bitch. [Taylor] You heard her, bitch. You're just suck-ups who act all nice to Chelsea so she'll give you expensive stuff. - At least our mom's not a slut. - What did you say? Your mom's dating Colin's married dad. You're a druggie with a slut for a mom. - Take it back! - No! - Get off her! - Guys, stop! - Hey, girls, cut it out! - Stop it. - Break it up. - Riley, you're out of control. Don't you dare talk to my daughter like that. - Riley, go to the car. - What's going on? I think you know exactly what's going on. Did you know that falsifying a drug test is a crime? God, you are delusional. - Why are you obsessed with me? - Obsessed with you? That's what you said about Ginny. But I'm beginning to think it was the other way around. That's ridiculous. I don't want anything to do with you. You better tell your daughter to stay away from Chelsea. Let's go. Mom, but Riley didn't do anything. You said if I hated it here, we can move back to the city. I wanna move back. We can't just leave, Riley. Then I'll go live with Dad. Everything is gonna be fine. Will you stop saying that? Nothing that's happening here is fine. And... I don't understand why would you wanna stay here after everyone is trashing you? Paige and Taylor said you're... hooking up with Colin's dad. I'm not hooking up with him, we're spending time together. How could you do that? After all your issues with Dad cheating. This is completely different than with your father, Riley. How is it different, Mom? Colin's dad is married. - You're a hypocrite. - Okay. You need to give me the benefit of the doubt just like I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt on that drug test. [siren wailing] What's happening? Stay in the car, Riley. [Riley] But why? I'm alright. [Mandy] Because I said so. [indistinct chatter on police radio] Good afternoon, ma'am. Something wrong? Jim. Hi, uh, you're Colleen's husband. I didn't recognize you in uniform. Noticed you're driving erratically. Excuse me? Ma'am, do we have permission to search your vehicle? - Yeah. Sure. - Step over here for me, please. Mom? [indistinct radio chatter] - Riley, it's fine. - Mom, what's he doing? It's fine, shh. Ma'am. Were you under the influence of these narcotics while you were driving your vehicle? What are you talking about? Those aren't mine. Then how did they get inside your car? I don't know, the window's broken, maybe someone put them in there. Ma'am, you have the right to remain silent. - Mom! - You're arresting me? ...can and will be held against you. - This is crazy. - Mom, what should I do? Riley, call your father. Come on, let's go. - Okay. - Alright, come on. [indistinct radio chatter] [crying] Thanks for, um, bailing me out. - I know it's awkward, having... - Mandy, please. I'm not gonna let you rot in jail. Riley, what are you doing? I'm going to live with Dad. And I told her she could. Riley, honey, why don't you go wait in the car? Let me talk to your mom. You said that she can live with you? Just because I bailed you out, doesn't mean I'm gonna let you ruin things for Riley. What are you talking about? Drugs? Really, Mandy? After everything she's been through. You have no idea what's been going on here. I know exactly what's going on here. And you're in no condition to raise our daughter. Riley... I know you don't believe me, but Olivia's behind all of this. Okay? She derailed my blog, she... She falsified your drug test. And I can prove it, okay? She's trying to poison everything including our relationship. I'm not gonna let her do that. I promise you, okay? Just... Just give me some time to prove it, okay? I'm sorry, Mom. I have to get away. Get yourself together, Mandy. Then we can talk about you seeing Riley again. [engine starts] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [phone buzzing] Hi. Thank you for calling me back. Um... I feel like I really messed things up. Yeah, you're not the only one. But I think we can fix it. At least I hope we can. Yeah, so do I. Do you have time to meet me? Um, about an hour? At that place we first had lunch? Sure, yeah, I'll be there. Oh, hey, um... I also called because my IT friend got the IP address of your "Mandy's Mom Adventures" hack job and traced it back. And where did it lead to? The country club computer. It's not proof of anything necessarily, you know. It's just access, someone at the club would have to check out the security footage to verify. I can't prove most of what Olivia did, Ellis. But I can make sure it doesn't happen to anyone ever again. Zailey, why are you out so early? You left me this note. Didn't you? [sighs] Look, I'm just trying to make it through these next few months. We're moving over the summer. I'm not leaving until we talk about this. Okay. But we can't talk here. When Zailey started Sayre High, I was overworked. Miserable in my marriage. Olivia took me under her wing. Drinks at the club... yoga... I was finally having fun again. And Zailey had a new best friend. - Chelsea. - Chelsea. It's like déjà vu. Then, word got around about Zailey being hospitalized. Rumors were flying like crazy. e started cutting again. The tension was too much for my marriage. My job suffered. My life fell apart. And you're sure it was Olivia. She's the only one who knew. And I was a threat to her, because I questioned the way the renovation was being handled. - For the school wing? - Yeah. I worked at the construction firm they hired. There were miscellaneous items that no one could track down. Payouts being made that no one could account for. So, are you saying that you think Olivia was skimming off the top? Honestly, I was too exhausted to prove it. I figured I'd just bide my time until my house sold and just get the hell out. And not end up like Ginny. Ginny and Beau dated in college. They remained friends. Beau was a sweet and caring guy. He'd never cheat on Olivia. But... The truth doesn't matter to Olivia. She saw the relationship as a threat. And destroyed her. With the right amount of pressure, any one of us could be pushed into a very dark place. Yeah, I felt that pressure. And I really screwed things up with Riley. Uh, I don't think you ought to blame yourself for what happened with Riley. If you act like the perfect parent all the time, like Olivia... then I'd have to wonder about you. Can you get a copy of the budget for the renovation, and the expenses? [scoffs] I wish. I don't have access to those files anymore. Oh, I know someone who does. - Really? - Who? The architect on the project. Me. [Mandy laughs] What did you find, Doug? [Doug] Well, it took one of my famous threatening attorney letters, but I found out that the lab tech, now fired, was in fact bribed to switch the student ID numbers on the drug test. Wasn't even Riley's test. I knew it. Um... did he say who, who paid him? Nah, money came in cash anonymously, with a typed letter. Of course it did. Oh, and listen, uh... I'm sorry about everything, Mandy. I hope this can make up at least a little bit for my not having faith in you. We're good, Doug. Kiss Riley for me, okay? Will do. Bingo. The mother load. Pun intended. We're talking six figures here. That's big time embezzlement. It's a start, but... It's not enough. Can you guys handle this? Absolutely, my pleasure. We'll hit the country club after we're done here and I've picked up Zailey. - Call you later? - Yeah, I look forward to it. - Okay. - Bye. May I see your card for a minute, Olivia? Have you been demoted to security detail now, Holly? Sorry, Olivia. As president of the board, I'm revoking your membership. What? You used one of our computers to cyberbully and harass another individual. Mandy Wallace. That's a crime. Tons of people use those computers. You can't prove anything. Actually, we have CCTV cameras here. If you pursue this, you'll regret it. I promise you. Tsk, no... I won't. I'm finally doing something for Ginny. Oh, and by the way, I have lots of friends in the media who would kill to run a story like this. Goodbye, Olivia. [indistinct chatter] [Chelsea] Ms. Wallace. I'm really sorry about Riley. I miss her. Yeah, me too. Look, I had nothing to do with it. I wanted Riley to make it, I swear. I don't even wanna do gymnastics anymore. Then why do you do it? Why don't you stop? I gotta go. Chelsea, wait, talk to me. Because my mom wouldn't hear it, okay? It doesn't fit with the program. I have to be perfect all of the time. You're the one writing the teen blog, aren't you? Chelsea, I'm not gonna tell your mom, okay? Like she'd believe you anyways. She'd have to notice something outside of her orbit. She's nothing like you. You'd do anything for Riley. You moved all the way out here so she could have a fresh start. I'd kill to have a mom like you. Oh, honey. [sighs] Chelsea... What if I told you I was gonna even the score a bit with your mom? I'd say do it. And can I watch? You can do one better. If you have the courage... I could use your help. Anything for Riley. [indistinct chatter] Oh. Shame on you. You didn't RSVP. Well, I had to make sure my date was available. U-um, sorry, my friend. [Ellis] There she is. Hi, Olivia. Chelsea. Where are you? Alright, folks, let's get this party started. Yeah, welcome. Can everybody please take their seats? Welcome to the Sayre High School Athletic Awards. [cheering] Alright, let's get started off by rolling the presentation. - Here we go. - I'm so excited. [male narrator] Sayre High School prides itself on running one of the finest athletic departments in the country. For more than 40 years, Sayre has been a symbol of excellence in the field of sports. And more importantly, sportsmanship. This year... [static] What's going on here? Can't this school do anything right? More than a million of you out there have known my blog. What the hell is this? My best friend... her mom... who's a really great person, she told me that to make a difference, I have to have courage. So... I am... the... [sighs] The "Pain Inside" anonymous blogger no longer. [audience gasping] [Chelsea] I am Chelsea Peterson, Olivia Peterson's daughter. What is going on here? Sit down, Olivia. Now, I have practically killed myself... to try and be the daughter that she always wanted. But I'm not perfect. And I'm still not good enough. So I'm not gonna take it anymore. [chuckles] I don't know what she's talking about. You go, Chelsea. How many of you have ever felt like Chelsea? How many of you moms have been bullied by Olivia? I just know you have your white trash hands all over this. What did you do? Bribe Chelsea? Pay her? Sleep with Beau? - You know what, Olivia... - I got this. You wanna bully me or wreck my life, that's one thing. But these are our daughters' lives that you're messing with. And I know you sabotaged Riley's drug test. You are so crazy. I have no idea what you're talking about. Your daughter is a drug addict. And you're just in denial. Can you believe this nonsense? It's not nonsense. You and I used to be friends, Olivia, until you drove me away by going after my daughter. You're a bully, and this whole room knows it. And I took pain pills from your purse. I'd seen you give them to Ginny. - What? - Give Ginny pills? - She gave Ginny... - Oh... You ungrateful little shit. Leave her alone. I did... everything for you. You think you would have placed on top if I hadn't pressured you? Championed you? You didn't do any of this for me. You did this for you. You wanna go through life half-assed like your father? Be my guest. Maybe he could kowtow to his parents to pay for college, like they pay for our mortgage every month. Did you already burn through all the money you embezzled from the renovation funds? - What? - Oh-ho-ho-ho. [Mandy] Don't act so surprised. You know what she does. She blackmails you until you cower in fear, and she can do whatever she wants. Now's your chance to stand up for yourselves. And each other. Colleen? Reyna? I'm with you, Mandy. I'm tired of being tormented by you, Olivia. I know you all are, too. Aren't you? - Yeah. - I'm with you, Mandy. - We're with you, Mandy. - Don't... You little bitch. - Oh. - Oh, oh. You are under arrest for assaulting an officer. Jim! Don't dare try to stop me, Colleen. I am done taking orders from the PTA. Now sit. [Olivia] You can't do this. Get these off of me. I'm sorry about your vehicle. I appreciate that, Jim. You're all gonna pay for this. Mandy, you're gonna have to watch your back the rest of your life. This is bullshit. [Olivia] Okay, I'm going... Riley. I've missed you. I missed you too, Mom. [exhales] I'm sorry. I never should have left. Would it be alright if I come back and live with you? We're the super duo, right? I love you, Mom. [Mandy] Mm. [Coach Shaw] Mandy? I think this belongs to you. I'm sorry. [indistinct chatter] Okay, last few, guys, I do still have a PTA meeting to run. - One quote, one quote. - One quote. How do you feel about the social media craze and the number one trend on Twitter, "#NoMomBullying," after your latest blog post went viral? I'm very proud. I never knew that it would blow up in quite this way, so... it's a bit overwhelming. But there will always be bullies. Both young and old. So, it's amazing to see so many people coming together to empower those who were... shamed into believing that they're not worthy. Like former "Pain Inside" blogger, Chelsea Peterson? Yeah. Chelsea needed to stand up to her mother. Heck, we all needed to stand up to her mother. [laughter] I understand Olivia Peterson's been brought up on charges of embezzlement. Okay, that's enough, guys. Thanks to the press, which, as you know, supports Sayre High School's new zero-tolerance policy for those who thrive on the intimidation of others, no matter what their age. [applause] [instrumental music] Rest in peace, Ginny. [music continues] [music continues]
