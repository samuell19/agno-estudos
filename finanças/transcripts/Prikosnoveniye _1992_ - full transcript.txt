TRANS F FILM STUDIO PRESENTS Directed by ALBERT MKRTCHYAN FILM THE CONTACT Olga Nikolayevna! Starring ALEKSANDR ZUYEV MARYANA POLTEVA Olga Nikolayevna! Anybody home? Olga Nikolayevna! Olga Nikolayevna, are you asleep? Kolya! Good Lord! Help! Help! Suicide. She suffocated the child and then slashed the wrists. Three hours ago, about 2 AM. - Alcohol, drugs? - No. And how would you explain these strange facial expressions? Have a look. Odd, don't you think? What hath God wrought... I found this in the kitchen, on the TV set. We depart for the better world. - Not much. - That's all we've got. There was a man... A married one. - Do you know his name? - I do. Yuri Afanasyevich. His last name is Travin. Who's he? What does he do for a living? He's a computer scientist in COSMOS association. And what about his personality? - A marvelous person. - You mean... Kind-hearted, calm, polite, well-read... His only flaw is that he's married. I see. And what about their life? It was perfect. Do you see any reasons for the suicide? Of this kind? No! Of what kind should it be for "yes"? None! Woman's kind of depression did not escape her. When he didn't come over. But it was melancholy mixed with hope! Their souls were like Siamese twins! Kolya thought the world of him! Daddy... I'm sorry... Daddy? He's the father, that's for sure. I guess you will talk to him. Yes, surely. You will easily recognise him. He resembles Kolya. Yuri Afanasyevich? - You need to talk to me. - I do. Come along. Is there any place we can talk? No, let's come to your place. If I correctly identified you. Yes, you identified me correctly. I am a special agent. May I... change my clothes? Of course. Did Olya die? Yes. So did Kolya... Yes, so did Kolya. Calm down, Yuri Afanasyevich. Let's go out, have an open air walk. It's better than the head office. Seryozha, stop the car. No, Seryozha, stay in the car. Fine. Yuri Afanasyevich. You are fine. You have an alibi. You were working all night in the computer centre. Well then... Yuri Afanasyevich... You guessed. From what you've said there is no conclusion... of the tragical outcome. I would like to ask what made you guess. I did not guess. How come? You first said... in the car... No? I did not guess. I was sure. I knew. Here we go. We've wasted so much time. What is the reason of the incident? I can't tell you that. And why is that? I am afraid. Of whom? Who are you afraid of? I'm afraid for you. For me... Not for yourself? I am done to the world. While you might extricate yourself from this story. Sorry, what's your name again? Andrey Konstantinovich. Close this case, Andrey Konstantinovich. Suicide owing to a nervous breakdown. That's the way it really is. That's my advice to you. Listen to me. That is very dangerous. One contact - and there's no way back. You are on the brink. Vain intimidation. I warn you. In fact, politics and mob are our issues. - I've got it. - You've got nothing. Maybe that's the reason you are still alive. And I am dying. Try to tell me everything quietly, do not rush. It's not the way you are used to. It's better not to know that. You see, that's not my first time. I understand it's not your first one... but the last one. We'll see, we'll see. Well... You are not afraid for yourself. You have warned me. All right. Olga's father... Nikolay Ilyich Maltsev persuaded her... to kill the child and to commit suicide. He came and persuaded her. Did you personally see that? Yes. I was present for a couple of times. But he wouldn't talk to me. I am not her husband. There was one time he told me... That I can die too. If altogether - that is good. Our pain will come to an end. Did one of you found your relationship with Olga painful? You, she, the child or the father? No. Here is your contact, Andrey Konstantinovich. I bought this for Kolya. So he could train. Boxing. Tell me. How often the father visited his daughter lately? Almost every day in August. I know... He came two days ago. Heart? Thank you. It's fine. I'm not feeling well. Where can I give you a lift to? To the nearest metro station, if you please. If I am not under arrest, of course. Oh, leave it, Yuri Afanasyevich. You are absolutely free. Tell me, Yuri Afanasyevich. Is that father mentally stable? Totally. Could he do that personally? Do you leave the room for this idea? What can you say about him? He is the best human being that I have ever known. Don't you want to know him any more? He died twelve years ago. Listen up. I'll have some sleep at home. while you... Nikolay Ilyich Maltsev, the late woman's father. Allegedly died twelve years ago. Find the proves of his death, its circumstances... and real attestations of eyewitnesses. - If something occurs call me at once. - Deal. Well... Come here, come here. No sleep, no sleep, I see! Food first, then a walk and... sleep! Good boy. Yes. Hello. What?! Bugger. Fine. I'm on my way. Life is wonderful and amazing. Well, doggy... Our witness hanged himself. - Not a minute of sleep. - Come along. He left us and came right here. Workmen had a smoke break. Here you go. And again - a note. I don't blame anyone. I depart for another world. Yeah. Right. He pointed out the direction. Otherwise we wouldn't guess. Andrey, here are the documents you requested. Nikolay Ilyich Maltsev. Tragically died 12 years ago on the factory floor. Chemical factory "Rozy". We have a witness. Vyacheslav Yerokhin. Born 1927, Russian. But to the point. Great. So long! The problem was not in the acid. The problem would be if it flowed to the fourth hardware workshop... where what we call alkali is kept. The whole district would be dead, see? It just spurted out and began boiling over. right down the floor, to the fourth hardware workshop. Maltsev pressed it at once. From where it spurted out. I saw everything. Say goodbye to a hand. Zero seconds. The hand is hapless. You can't fight the fountain. It spurts out in every direction. Alarm screams over the whole factory. Of course, nothing can be heard. Where to run? What to grab? - And you? - Me? I was right here. I threw off my one-piece suit and started building a dam. And wiping it up... so it wouldn't flow to the fourth hardware workshop. See that? The hand. It's been twelve years now. And Kolya? Kolya died right here. Right here. Splashed all over, the face... He was all crooked. They said that to fit him in the coffin his sinews were undercut. I don't know if that's true. It can't be a mistake or fraud. The corpse was uglified... but it was Maltsev. No doubt. Open-hearted, honest, amiable. An excellent father! He is survived by two daughters. I had a leave at the time. But I came to the funeral as soon as I found out. Marina Nikolayevna. Yes. I'm an investigator in charge of of your late sister's case. When can we have a talk? Any time. Now. Here? Marina Nikolayevna... Our conversation is not easy and it may take long. You're in charge of the funeral repast. We don't have it. I beg your pardon, what? Neither funeral repast nor rites. Mommy, are aunt Olya and Kolyenka buried forever? No, they will come alive and go back to us. - When? - Soon. Tomorrow? No, not tomorrow. You know, they will turn into birds. and will be flying above us. Mom, when will I die? Never talk like that again! Mommy, I want to fly like a bird! Let's say goodbye. Our condolences. Goodbye. I hope my dog won't disturb you. - So pretty. What's his name? - Smok. Mom, buy me one too, same stupid. Why stupid? Smok isn't stupid. Oops, I meant kind, kind. Would you like to eat? We are hungry, we had no breakfast today. Smok is hungry too. Let's go to "Zakarpatskiy". A new restaurant near Taganskaya station. We'll sit and have a talk. I have a few questions to you. One more question. You buried your sister and nephew tightly wrapped up in shrouds. Why? It's an old Russian custom. How did you buried your father? In a shroud as well. That was mother's will. By the way... About your mother. How did she die? The official version is heart failure. But now I doubt that. She couldn't live without my father so she poisoned herself. Dichloroethane. Your late father often haunted your sister. Marina! What's wrong? Everything is just fine. I'm sorry, there must be something in the air. Please, go on. Your father... continually talked you sister into commiting suicide... just after killing the child. A powerful persuasion, don't you think. See? I know, I am a certified psychologist. So, a shroud! Wrap yourself in and impose yourself for the father. A safe and powerful method. - I see. - Marina. Your sister, her son and Yuri Travin knew something important. What is not safe to know. They were neatly disposed. By mere chance I managed to talk to Travin before they got him. Apart from that the plan was flawless. He hanged himself. Mommy, I ran out of cakes. All because Smok eats very fast. - That is because his teeth are big. - He's a candy hound. Waiter, four more cakes please. Four! Four! Why are you screaming! You screamer! What are you doing there? Smok is very funny. Your Smok is very funny. We are playing outside. - What is he doing? - He walks on his hind legs. - Thank you. - You torture the dog. You know, I like you and I will probably help you. Cocktail? Uh-huh. Petya, two cocktails please! Maybe you will help me. Your version is surely flawless. If you proceed from the facts that are at your disposal. Here's the new fact for you. Father haunted me too. Well... Interesting. Many times? Many. That's odd. There is nothing I know about politics, mob or money. My work and Nastya - that's all I have. Who would benefit from my or, God save, Nastya's death? Who? Apparently, somebody would. Think. Try to remember. No. After all my encounters with father, I mean ghost... I am certain that it's really my father. I have no doubts. Autosuggestion. They sent you a psychic. Some kind of hypnosis. Oh, leave it. What for? That's nonsense. Do you believe in that? In fact, I truly believe in nonsense. Do you believe that the dead haunt us to take with them? I most certainly don't. You'd better do. They three haunted me today. Father, Olya and Kolya. They persuaded you again? Yes. They also said to me... that after the funeral... I will go to a restaurant with my future husband. How's this? Not impressed. You just made that up? I even asked, "Wedding... When?" When? In a week after the funeral. - Are you married? - No. See! Everything tracks perfectly so far. How do you think, Marina... Will they return? Father will. Am I supposed to meet your father? How do you think? Parents are supposed to meet fiance. Perhaps. Aren't you afraid? My nerves are fine. Marina, would you mind if I kept a duty at your place. Fine. Hold it, hold it! Gimme back, gimme back! Things are weird... Never saw a show like that. The late Olga is often haunted by her dead father. Maltsev, right? In a shroud! And persuades. Attaboy! Dare we? No vodka! I see. Not a bad show, I must say. Hypnosis, orchestrating. These guys must also have... a mighty psychic. And their consultants! Nifty! A certified psychologist, by the way. A fabulous creature! Sheer beauty! - Yes? - Yes. I'm talking about Marina... the deceased's sister. Beauty, huh? It's would be a pity to imprison her. Pity! Sister, you say. False, fictitious it is. Hypnosis, psychic, the ghost. Trifle! I don't believe it. Incredulous. I'm not buying it. Marina says that... that ghost haunts her too. The ghost? The ghost. One more. Tonight... she was haunted by her late sister Olga with son. She forecasted her that I... will marry her. In a week. The dead one! The living one! Not great but... quite bearable. Fine. Jokes aside! I volunteered for the night watch at her place. She eagerly supported the idea. I'll go tomorrow. Tomorrow they will be killing you, apparently. I'm not the hypnotic type. However, they can make me a drug-addict. To turn me into moron. Something tells me... that everything will be way easier. They don't need elaborate schemes now. You all will simply disappear. You and Smok - in sewerage. While Marina and her daughter - to another city. another countries, another passports. Work out this possibility... - So if things go wrong they wouldn't run away. - Consider it done. - For your health! - Come on! What's wrong? Get me some vodka. Where's the music? Why not playing? Indeed. Short circuit. How bizarre. Even Japan produces lousy stuff. First time ever! That's all because our foul-smelling air. The window is wide open and yet there's no air. Are you leaving already? Yes. I am. Well, shall I drive you? There's no need to. That's too far. I'll pay a visit to Marina Nikolayevna. You'd better not. You'd make a mistake. Good evening! Here we are. - Is that for me? - Yes. Thank you, Smok. That's from me, not from Smok. Sit! Sit! Please have a sit, Smok. Come along. Is there something wrong that you came earlier? There is. I just wanted to pay a visit. It's not official. Coffee, tea? Coffee. - I wouldn't mind having a drink. - I was just about to offer you one. As a matter of fact, I don't drink. I don't offer you to. Just a sip. Will your father come tonight? I have a feeling... that he is already here. A mere feeling. I can't explain it verbally. I feel his presence, so to say. He's not here, right? - Do you see him? - No, I don't. - Coffee? - Coffee, sure. Marina. I heard your father loved you so much. Why would he want you to be dead? Death is a natural human state. You don't remember your life before birth. You don't know what will become of you after death. There's a whole world there. A better world. I doubt that. Have you ever thought why the dead do not come back? I was explained a long ago. When I was a pre-schooler. You got it all wrong. They never come back because life here is... filthy, painful, and unbearable. Life is nonsense? If beyond the death line there is paradise for everyone... everyone without regard... So what is here? How to explain that? Our life is an illness. It's a grave illness. Do flu or cold surprise you? There's no sense. You're just used to it. Life is an illness as well. A dead man is not ill. His soul, I mean. All the dead men that haunt us are the cults of dead associates. They have an amazing gift... to lure us to the next world. They call themselves... forzies. Forzies? Yes, forzies. Maybe... all these forzies are evil spirits? Even church refuses to bury people who dared to kill themselves. Whatever turn it takes, life is beautiful and amazing. Marina! Are these forzies capable of murder? Their goal is incitement to a suicide. But they can kill... a child... so that the mother will kill herself. That is what happened to Olga? That is what probably will happen to me. My father is now talking to you through me! No! No!!! I won't give you Nastya! I am foul! Foul! No! Go away! It'll be fine. Do they leave anyone at peace? Yes. Bold, self-centered and dumb people. They take the best ones. They need them there. The best ones turn into forzies. They are ruthlessly murdered in the pride of their years. Yes, that's right. The best ones are the first to die. Usually when young. Did you want to talk to father? That would be way too hard. I decided it would be better this way. Father was there when you came. Can their read our minds? - They won't read yours. - Why? Because you are strong. I felt he wanted to but he couldn't. That is great. - That is bad, bad. - Why, Marina? Because you are strong and kind. Marina... Don't! Calm down. Everything will be fine. Sorry. I just fell into a muse. You scared me! You are shameless! Wait! - Am I forgiven? - No. Can dogs feel them? I don't know. I saw it myself that dogs yawl at the deceased. As long as we're awake, let's get up! You forgot to say, "Good morning!" Good morning, sweetheart. Nastya! Nastya! 39,9 C Who are you? The father? A relative. How's she? The rarest form of diphtheritis. The final phase. She would live... for a couple of hours. - Astonishing. - What, what is? The mother claims that yesterday the child was perfectly fine. - That's right. - I don't believe you. The shift of this kind is impossible. The child... is dead. You see, she is practically dead. I am sorry. Marina... I am going to do something. I thought that... Fine. Shall I drive you home? Fine. I'll call you. Out! Smok! Sit! Sit! Wait here. MIUSSA CEMETERY 7-43. Accumulator 1. Leave the track 1 free. Train 683 arrives at track 12. Number 24, put on brakes! 24, put on brakes! Train 1102 arrives at track 5. Nikolay Ilyich. There must be some mistake. Misunderstanding. Let's discuss it together. Nastya is about to die. Marina will pass away right after her. Track 11, you have my permission to depart! I'm talking not about them... but about me. As far as I know... everybody dies alone. What I am going to tell you is... If I died... I wouldn't come here. Haunt. - I am not... how's that... - Forzy! Yes, that's right. I am a sinful man. You need me here. For all of my life, I've been ignoring... the misfortunes of others. Always have. Never paid attention. Express train on the third track! I... I... when duty-bound... killed three in a fire-fight. One - in a hand-to-hand combat. Besides, indirectly caused the death of many others. I'm not sure about the number. You can check it. You need me here. And the most important is... I am young, strong, greedy, violent... I am not a saint. - Go on! - Well. So I could work for you... I need certain conditions. I need a wife, a daughter, Smok! We will all become dumb, ruthless, philistine. Ready to kill for a pair of slippers. To sell and to be happy. To disregard all humans... And even the dead men... especially the dead men... Give Nastya back! Let us go, I beg you! They need some rest. And I need to think. I beg you... Let her go... I will pay off... You will be pleased. Let her go! Fine. I do not thank you. Because you... did the right thing. Acted properly. For your own good. As well as mine and our common goals. Remember. Follow the vow and promise... Forget your stupid saying. "Life is beautiful and amazing" Your destiny is on your tongue. That always was like that. Smok! Smok! - Excuse me, have you seen a dog here? - No. - And a car? - No. Is that Miussa cemetery? - Manikhino forestry! - And what is there, Moscow or Balashikha? - You are in Kiev! - Kiev?! Yay, Andrey's here! Come here! Stop hugging! Stop hugging! That's my boy! My doggy! Did you miss me? Calm down. He loves you so much. Did you take him as a puppy? Yes. We met when he was only a month old. He then had another masters. He had dog distemper. And they took him to the vet to euthanize him. By pure chance I happened to be in this vet. I took him home out of pity. I was lucky to cure him. Here's him as a puppy. I took a photo. So pretty! Look! Smok, that is you! Don't torture the dog! Come on, folks, throw the ball in. Come on. Fine, fine. Dribbling! Gates! Come on! Smok! Where are you going? Wait for me! Don't push, I warn you! Warning. Attention! You're being ph-y-tographed! I said, phytographed phytographed! Andrey, can you imagine, there was a horrible mistake! Instead of the test... Instead of Maltseva's test... they put Paltseva's test. Can you imagine? - Things happen. It's fine now. - I don't know what happens. Why did you go to Kiev? To greet sacred relics. When I came there... and was said the fever's gone... and that is not diphtheritis... - I don't know... - Marina... Stop that! Bygones. Everything is over now. Life is beautiful and amazing. Andrey! What's wrong? It's fine. Are you not well? You are sweaty. I'm just tired and hungry. Have a sit. A glass of water? I'm fine. Nastya! Stop! Give me a hand! Nastya! Nastya! Nastya, what happened? I wanted to fly like a bird. What happened?! Like a bird? Are you out of your mind? Nastya, sweety, hold on, you're not a bird. Sweety, hold on. Smok! Nikolay Ilyich! One time... doesn't count. Attention! Done. Thanks, buddy! Nice of you. Thanks, doggy. Back off, you'll smear the suit. One moment, guys! It's been exactly a week. Marina, keep it simple. Thank you. For those... For those who... are too nice to be imprisoned. I mean the groom. And his significant other. Now a kiss. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! And now what - honeymoon? Sea! Sea! I want a sea! Surely. I promised. Sochi, probably. No, to Yalta. I want to Sochi! Sochi! Sochi! Quite reasonable. And then? Bulgaria. I can also recommend Turkey. Bulgaria! Turkey! Bulgaria! I can't afford all that. We will loan you money. From the union funds. You're a true friend! Firstly, there is cognac in Bulgaria. And in Turkey... However, you are accompanied by your wife... Mister! Honeymoons without wives are extremely... extremely rare. So Turkey is off now! A lonely sail is flashing white Amdist the blue mist of the sea! What does it seek in foreign lands? What did it leave?.. What did it leave? God, I never thought it could be THAT good. The best is yet to come! Life is beautiful and amazing! Where do you pull me? Smok, there must be a cat there. Look. Wow!.. It's so cold there. Look at you, what a nice little girl! Such a doll! - Let me pat you! - Hands off! You the winny-binny girl! Shut up, you dog. Isn't it hot in a hat? Hold it. Whoa? Apologize to the dog! Pardonnez-moi! Shall we go now? Marina! Let's go! Hurting the boy... Shame on you! Listen up. Have a stroll right there! Along with Kommissar Rex. I want to talk to your chick. - Politely! - To form a tender friendship. Politely! Nastya, don't look! Smok, guard! Lay down! Lay down... I said, lay down! Andrey! Gun! Grab my gun! Shoot! You moron, shoot! Stop, you bastard! Stop or I'll kill you! Bugger. Mommy! Stay away! I'll break her skull! - Drop the gun! - Marina! - Drop the gun, you sod! Stay away, arse! On the ground! Nastya, don't be afraid! Leave the child free! Listen to me. Dead men, forzies - they have nothing to do with it. Simply met riffraff in a lonely spot. Things happen, believe me. No, that was the father. That was him who sent them. He calls us, can't you see that? Marina! I beg you, calm down. I can't. I'm scared! Calm down! Calm down. Mom! Nastya! Nastya! Nastya, wake up! Quiet, Smok! Smok! What's wrong? Should we leave? Smok, should we leave? Marina! The dog feels something evil. We should leave now. Give! Give me her. Marina! Quick! Quick! Smok! Smok, what's now? Why did you bring us here? What's up with you? Smok! Shall we wait? Shall we wait, Smok? Can you hear? Smok, come! Quiet! Guys! We should lift this slab up. Where's the crane? Guys, I have to be there! Guys, there's the crane! - Restricted area! - Listen to me! A man is pressed down by a slab. - We need a crane! - I'll be right back. I say, young man! Under the ruins... there are giant ants. They've been gnawing corpses, I saw them. - These are rats! - No, ants! They are bigger than rats. They've got ant hill here. There are plenty of ant hills here. Believe me, I know. Too much stress. Insane. Oddball. I am not! Have a look! These are their cocoons. White... eggs. They were brought here. See? Young man! Would you lite us a bonfire? Fine. Wait here. Marina, don't go anywhere. Forzy-sch! Forzy-sch! Forzy? Have you seen such a miracle, Smok? Yesterday it was summer, and today, it is snowing. Well then, doggy. It's all perfectly clear with this world. Let's see what's in the next one? Sit. Yes. Hello. Life is beautiful and amazing.
