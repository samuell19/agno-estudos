HOW YOU DOING?" - JUST LOOK AT THIS RING. IT'S WAY TOO SOFT FOR COMPETITION. - DALLAS, THAT TRACK RING KEEPS THE FOOTING SAFE. HORSES DON'T GET HURT, THE KIDS DON'T GET HURT. - I'M PAYING YOU GOOD MONEY TO TEACH MELINDA TO RACE, AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH A PLUGGED NICKEL. - IT SEEMS LIKE THIS PLUGGED NICKEL HAS DONE GOOD ENOUGH TO GET YOUR DAUGHTER TO THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. YOU KNOW, DALLAS, YOU GOT A REAL ATTITUDE. - PERSONALLY, BEN, I'D RATHER BE A WIDOW WITH AN ATTITUDE THAN A BROKEN DOWN OLD COWBOY WITHOUT A DIME TO HIS NAME.

WE ALREADY MADE FRIENDS. - WELL, I GUESS YOU HAVE. - CRAZIEST THING I EVER SAW. I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT IF I DIDN'T SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES. I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT. - SUNNY, THIS HERE IS BUDDY. BUDDY WORKS WITH ME. - HOWDY. - HI. - SUNNY, I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU RUN OVER TO THE TACK ROM, GRAB DOWN A BRUSH. I'LL BET WE CAN CONVINCE BUDDY HERE TO GIVE YOU A LESSON IN BRUSHING GINGER DOWN. - REALLY? - YEP. - OH, YOU'D LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU. YES, YOU WOULD. STAY RIGHT HERE, OKAY? DON'T YOU GO ANYWHERE. - HERE YOU GO. YEAH. RIGHT UNDERNEATH. RIGHT UP ON THE WALL YOU'LL SEE THEM UP THERE. - OKAY. - I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT. - WHO IS THAT GIRL WITH THE CRUTCH? - I DON'T KNOW HER NAME, BUT I THINK SHE'S A FRIEND OF BEN'S. - I'VE SEEN HER AROUND HERE. - WHAT'S SHE DOING WITH THAT OLD CROW BAIT GINGER? - I DON'T KNOW. WHY? - BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW, THAT'S WHY. - OKAY. - READY FOR SWEET DREAMS? - UH-HUH. WHAT'S THAT? - THIS IS A BOOK THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL ABOUT HORSES. WANT ME TO READ YOU SOME? - SURE. MOMMY? - HUH. - DO YOU THINK THERE ARE HORSES IN HEAVEN? - I WOULD THINK SO. - DO YOU THINK DADDY WOULD HAVE A HORSE IN HEAVEN? - I THINK THAT DADDY WOULD PROBABLY RATHER HAVE A SAIL BOAT. LET'S SEE... - YOU LOVE TO GET YOUR TUMMY BRUSHED, DON'T YOU? YOU'RE LOOKING SO PRETTY. - THEY'RE SELLING THAT HORSE, YOU KNOW. - ARE YOU TALKING TO ME? - THE GUY'S HERE RIGHT NOW WHO BUYS HORSES TO CHOP THEM UP AND SELL THEM FOR DOG FOOD. I HEARD HIM TALKING TO BEN, AND THAT'S THE HORSE HE'S HERE TO GET. - YOU'RE A LIAR! - WHATEVER. - DON'T WORRY, GINGER, I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYBODY HURT YOU. - SUNNY, GO ON. CLEAR OUT OF HERE FOR A MINUTE. GO AHEAD. - SO, THIS IS THE MAN KILLER I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT, HUH? - HE SURE DON'T LIKE ME, THAT'S FOR SURE. - I DON'T KNOW, BEN. SHE'S PRETTY SKINNY. I'LL GIVE YOU $400 DOLLARS FOR HER. - BEN, I'D TAKE IT AND RUN. - SUNNY, SUNNY, WE'RE DOING BUSINESS HERE. WHAT IS IT? - I'LL BUY HER. - YOU'LL WHAT? - I'LL BUY GINGER. - HOW MUCH YOU OFFERING? - $4 DOLLARS. - UH-HUH. $4 DOLLARS. SUNNY, WHY SHOULD I GO AND SELL GINGER TO YOU FOR $4 DOLLARS.

NO WONDER I'M BROKE ALL THE TIME. - YOU HAD TO DO IT, HUH? - BUDDY, I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF. - AWE! - SHERRY, DID I DO THE RIGHT THING? YOU'RE DARN RIGHT, I DID. - MOM, MOM, GUESS WHAT? I BOUGHT GINGER! - YOU BOUGHT WHO? - GINGER! BEN WAS GOING TO SELL HER FOR DOG FOOD, BUT I SAID I'D BUY HER AND BEN SAID OKAY. - WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE. WHO IS BEN? - THE COWBOY WHO OWNS GINGER. - WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO WITH DOG FOOD? DID YOU BUY A DOG? - NO, NO, A HORSE! YOU'VE GOTTA SEE HER. COME ON! COME ON! - A HORSE? - COME ON! - YOU BOUGHT A HORSE? - COME ON, MOM. THIS IS GINGER. HI, GINGER. - HEY THERE. YOU MUST BE SUNNY'S MOTHER. - BEN? - YEAH, BEN. BEN TAYLOR. - UM, THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING. SUNNY SAYS YOU SOLD HER THAT HORSE. - THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT. - SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL. YOU CAN'T SELL HER A HORSE WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. - THAT'S A FACT. BUT YOU SEE, THERE WAS SOME EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. - REALLY? SUCH AS? - WELL... [GIGGLING] YOU'RE A SWEETIE. YOU'RE FUNNY. - LOOK, THAT'S ALL WELL AS GOOD, MISTER, BUT THE TRUTH IS I CAN'T AFFORD TO FEED AND CARE FOR A HORSE. - SUNNY CAN DO A LITTLE WORK FOR ME PART-TIME TO PAY FOR GINGER'S CARE. I THINK IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR HER. - CAN'T YOU SEE SHE'S BEEN HURT? - I'M NO DOCTOR, BUT LOOK AT THEM. IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE GOOD MEDICINE TO ME. [GIGGLING] - YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE NO DOCTOR. COME ON, SUNNY. WE'RE GOING HOME. - COME ON, MOM! - SUNNY, WE'RE GOING HOME. COME ON, GET YOUR CRUTCH. - I JUST WANTED TO STAY A LITTLE BIT LONGER. - LET'S GO. - BYE BYE, GINGER. - YOU'RE CUTTING TOO TIGHT IN THE TURN. SWEETHEART, PAY ATTENTION! YOU'RE CUTTING TOO TIGHT. COME ON, MELINDA, CONCENTRATE! COME ON! OH, NO! - MELINDA, COME ON OVER. WE CUT THOSE A LITTLE CLOSE, DID WE? TAKE YOUR BOOT OUT OF THE STIRRUP. DID YOU ADJUST THESE? - DALLAS DID. SAID THEY WERE TOO SHORT. - UH-HUH. EVERYBODY'S AN EXPERT. THAT'S WHY YOU LOST A STIRRUP. GOOD NEWS. THAT RUN WAS AN 18 FLAT. - BUT I KNOCKED DOWN ALL THE BARRELS. - THAT'S WHY WE'RE GONNA TRY AGAIN, HUH? HERE YOU GO. ALL SET? - YEP. - RIDE AWAY. HERE WE GO. READY? GO AHEAD! THERE YOU GO! THERE YOU GO. LOOKING GOOD! GOOD! GOOD MELINDA. COME ON. KICK THE BARREL. NOW KICK IT. KICK IT. BRING IT ON. HERE WE GO. THERE YOU GO! - YES! - ALL RIGHT, MELINDA, THAT ONE WAS 15.9. - YES! - I DID IT! I BROKE 17! I WANNA RIDE AGAIN. - ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT IT. YOU'VE GOT IT. HEAD OVER. - 'CAUSE GINGER'S HURT LIKE ME, I COULDN'T EVEN RIDE HER IF I WANTED TO. - THAT IS NOT THE POINT. WHAT IF YOU GET KICKED OR STEPPED ON? - GINGER WOULDN'T DO THAT. SHE LOVES ME. YOU'RE NOT FAIR. YOU HAD A HORSE WHEN YOU WERE MY AGE. - THAT WAS DIFFERENT. I WASN'T INJURED. - I WISH DADDY WERE ALIVE. HE'D LET ME HAVE GINGER. - SUNNY, DADDY WOULDN'T LET YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT WAS BAD FOR YOU. - GINGER'S NOT BAD FOR ME! SHE'S MY ONLY REAL FRIEND. - DO YOU THINK DR. OLSON IS A SMART MAN? - I GUESS. - OKAY. I WILL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU. IF DR. OLSON SAYS THAT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO BE AROUND GINGER, THEN YOU CAN HAVE HER. - YOU PROMISE? - I PROMISE. - MORNING, LADY. - DUTCH JOHN, YOU LOOK MIGHTY FINE IN THIS NEW CAR. - THAT OLD THING? NOTHING BUT A HORSE WITH WHEELS. - MELINDA, SAY HI TO MR. HATHAWAY. - HI, MR. HATHAWAY. - GIRL, YOU'RE GROWING FASTER THAN A WEED ON A CAL PINE AND YOU'RE JUST AS PRETTY AS YOUR MOM. - LET'S GO INSIDE. WE'VE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. - WELL, I TALKED TO MY COMPANY ABOUT SPONSORING MELINDA. HEAD HONCHO LIKES THE IDEA BUT THERE'S A LITTLE WRINKLE. - WRINKLE? WHAT'S THAT? - IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN THIS YEAR. MELINDA DID REAL GOOD LAST YEAR ON THE REGIONALS, BUT TO SPONSOR HER, SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO WIN THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. - THAT'S A LOT TO ASK OF A TWELVE YEAR OLD. - FULL RIDE COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP, ALL EXPENSES, GEAR, SADDLE, TRUCK, TRAILER. OH, AND I FORGOT TO MENTION $100,000 DOLLARS CASH. [WHISTLING] TO WIN, SHE NEEDS A NEW HORSE, JOHN. NOT THAT BROKEN DOWN BAG OF BONES BEN'S GOT HER ON. - IF I WERE YOU, DALLAS, I'D LISTEN TO BEN. IF HE'S GOT HER RIDING A NAG, HE'S GOT REASONS FOR IT. - FORGET BEN. WHAT ABOUT A NEW HORSE, JOHN? - OKAY. NAME'S STEEL. JOHNNY DOBSON'S SELLING HIM. BUT HE'S EXPENSIVE. - HOW EXPENSIVE? - VERY. - I CAN HANDLE THAT. - BEN NAMED HER GINGER BECAUSE SHE'S THE SAME COLOR AS GINGERBREAD. HE SOLD HER TO ME FOR $4 DOLLARS. SHE GOT BANGED UP IN A RODEO, AND SHE LIMPS JUST LIKE ME. - AND I DON'T THINK THAT A GROWN MAN SHOULD BE SELLING A LITTLE GIRL A HORSE AND AN INJURED LITTLE GIRL AT THAT. AND HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME MY PERMISSION. - WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. TIME OUT, EVERYONE. TAKE A DEEP BREATH, HUH? SUNNY, WHY DON'T YOU HOP UP ON THE TABLE NOW. WELL, THAT WAS VERY GOOD. - MY MOM SAID IF YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY, I COULD KEEP GINGER. - ALL RIGHT, SO SUPPOSE YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. - WELL, SHE HAS BEEN HANGING OUT AT THIS GUY'S STABLE, THIS BEN CHARACTER. AND HE SOLD HER THIS CRIPPLED HORSE. - GINGER. - GINGER. FOR $4 DOLLARS. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR HER TO BE AROUND HORSES. BUT I PROMISED HER THAT I WOULD TALK TO YOU BEFORE I MADE MY DECISION. - OH, SO I CAN BE THE BAD GUY, HUH? I GET THE PICTURE. YOUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT SUNNY DOESN'T RE-INJURE HER LEG, HUH? - YEAH. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. - WELL, IT'S TRUE THERE CERTAINLY IS SOME RISK INVOLVED IN OWNING A HORSE. BUT THAT HAS TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST THE POSSIBLE GOOD IT CAN DO. SO SUNNY, HOW IS YOUR LEG DOING? - BETTER. - UH-HUH, HOW BETTER? - I DON'T LIMP AS BAD. AND IT DOESN'T HURT LIKE BEFORE. - WELL YOU CERTAINLY SEEM TO BE DOING A LOT BETTER THAN THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE? - YES, I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE. - SUNNY, ARE YOU GONNA BE RIDING THIS HORSE? - NO. I JUST WALK HER. BEN SAID NOBODY CAN RIDE HER BECAUSE OF HER LEG. - DR. OLSON? - YES, DR. UPCHURCH? - I'VE CHECKED X-RAYS AND I HAVE THEM IN MY OFFICE WHEN YOU CARE TO COME IN TO DISCUSS THEM. - ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. I'LL BE RIGHT IN. WELL, MEDICALLY SPEAKING, MRS. MATHEWS, THERE'S REALLY NO REASON WHY SUNNY SHOULDN'T HAVE GINGER. - OH, PLEASE, MOM? YOU PROMISED. - OH, BOY. - PLEASE? - WELL, THIS IS AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT BUT, OKAY. A PROMISE IS A PROMISE. - THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! - HEY, STABLE GIRL, YOU STILL WASTING YOUR TIME ON THAT OLD CROW BAIT? I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU THE ONLY THING SHE'D BE GOOD FOR IS GLUE. HEY, MAYBE YOU CAN GET HER A WOODEN LEG. I HEAR THEY GOT THEM REAL CHEAP AT SEARS. - DON'T YOU GIRLS HAVE SOMEPLACE TO BE GETTING TO? GO ON. WHAT IS IT? WHY YOU CRYING? - THOSE GIRLS SAID TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT GINGER. - YOU BELIEVE IT? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, IF YOU'RE GONNA BE A COWGIRL, YOU GOT TO BE TOUGH. YOU CAN'T LET MEAN PEOPLE HURT YOUR FEELINGS. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW. - IS BEN A REAL COWBOY? - YOU BET. BEN AND ME, WE RODE THE RODEO CIRCUIT TOGETHER FOR A LOT OF YEARS. - BUDDY, CAN GINGER GET WELL? - I DON'T KNOW. VET SAYS SHE'S CRIPPLED. - MAYBE HE WAS WRONG. - COULD BE. BEN AND ME, WE'LL LOOK INTO IT A LITTLE MORE FOR YOU, OKAY? - THANK YOU! - OKAY, HONEY. - I DON'T KNOW, MR. TAYLOR. THE DAMAGE TO THE ANKLE IS EXTENSIVE. THE NERVE ISN'T DAMAGED, THAT'S FOR SURE. SHE CAN FEEL THIS INJURY. WOE. - EASY. - I'LL DO MY BEST TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH GINGER. - DON'T WORRY, MOM. SHE'LL LOVE YOU JUST FINE. WHAT ARE THEY DOING, MOM? - I DON'T KNOW. - THANKS A LOT, DOC. - I HEARD ABOUT A FELLOW WITH A HORSE HOSPITAL WHO'S BEEN DOING SOME EXPERIMENTAL SURGERY ON CRIPPLED HORSES. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, DOC? - YOU MUST BE TALKING ABOUT DALE JANSSEN. - THAT'S THE FELLOW. - HE'S HAD SOME SUCCESS WITH SOME NEW TECHNIQUES BUT HE'S EXPENSIVE. HE COULD RUN YOU AS HIGH AS 10,000 AND IT STILL AIN'T FOR SURE. - DOC, I'M GLAD YOU STOPPED BY. APPRECIATE IT. - SURE. - HOW MUCH IS $10,000 DOLLARS? - A LOT. IT'S ENOUGH TO BUY A CAR. - DO WE HAVE $10,000 DOLLARS? - NO. I'M AFRAID WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ONE. - HOWDY. - GINGER, THIS IS MY MOM. - HI, GINGER. WHAT A NICE HORSE. - GINGER'S THE BEST. IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT BAD LEG, SHE'D BE WORTH 50 GRAND. - YEAH, A LOT MORE THAN THAT. - WOW! - I'LL TALK TO THE DOC JANSSEN AND SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. MAYBE HE CAN CUT US A DISCOUNT. - I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO TO ANY TROUBLE. - NO TROUBLE TO ASK A QUESTION OR TWO. LET'S GET HER PUT BACK. - THAT STEEL IS A POWERFUL HORSE. THINK MELINDA CAN CANDLE HIM? - I TOLD MELINDA THAT I DIDN'T SPEND $30,000 DOLLARS AND RISK LOSING THIS PLACE TO HAVE HER HOLD BACK. SHE'LL DO IT. - WE'LL SEE. - COME ON, SUNNY. GIVE ME THREE MORE. JUST THREE MORE AND WE'RE DONE FOR THE DAY. - DOCTOR, I'VE BEEN ON THIS THING FOR 20 MINUTES ALREADY. - GO AHEAD AND GET OFF, ALEXANDRA. - THANKS, DOCTOR. SEE YOU TOMORROW. - BYE BYE. GOOD JOB. - I CAN'T. - COME ON, YOU JUST DID, SUNNY. TWO MORE. - BUT IT HURTS. - I KNOW. KEEP GOING. LAST ONE. LAST ONE, SUNNY. YES! GOOD JOB! YES. NOW THAT'S HOW HARD YOU HAVE TO WORK EVERY TIME IF YOU WANT TO GET THAT LEG BETTER, OKAY? - JESSE? - YES? - COULD THERAPY HELP A HORSE WITH A BAD LEG? - I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HORSES, BUT IF THERE'S NO BONES BROKEN, I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN HURT. - THANK YOU. - YOU SEE, I TOLD YOU IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR A WHILE. - I'M STILL NOT SURE I'M VERY GOOD COMPANY. - YOU'RE THE BEST COMPANY I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME. - OH, PLEASE. A MAN LIKE YOU? A HANDSOME SUCCESSFUL DOCTOR MUST HAVE WOMEN CHASING AFTER HIM. - KATHLEEN, THERE ARE SO MANY GOLD DIGGERS OUT THERE. I DON'T EVEN TELL A WOMAN WHAT I DO UNTIL A SECOND OR THIRD DATE. - WELL, YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME. I HATE TO BRING THIS UP DURING DINNER BUT HOW DO YOU THINK SUNNY IS DOING? - WELL FOR A WHILE, TO BE QUITE HONEST, I WAS CONCERNED. HER ATTITUDE WAS SO DOWN. SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE TRYING TO GET BETTER. BUT I HAVE TO SAY, THIS HORSE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN JUST THE RIGHT MEDICINE TO LIFT HER SPIRITS. - GINGER. - GINGER. - I STILL WORRY ABOUT HER SOMETIMES. DR. OLSON-- - HUGH. HUGH. - HUGH. - HERE YOU GO. - NOW LISTEN GINGER, I'M KEEPING MY END OF OUR DEAL. I'M WORKING MY BUTT OFF, AND JESSE SAYS I'M GETTING BETTER. YOU'VE GOT TO TRY HARDER AND LET ME HELP YOU GET YOUR LEG FIXED. WE'RE GONNA RUN SO FAST, THOSE GIRLS ARE GONNA BE SO SORRY THEY SAID ANYTHING MEAN ABOUT YOU. YEAH. WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THEM WITH A BIG MOUTHFUL OF DUST. YES, WE ARE. YES, WE ARE. DOES THAT FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER? - HEY. JUST FINISHED BEDDING DOWN AND FEEDING THE HORSES. EVERYTHING'S ALL NICE AND QUIET. - GOOD. - I THOUGHT I'D GO OVER THE WAGON WHEEL AND GET A BITE TO EAT. WANNA COME ALONG? - NO. NO THANKS, BUDDY. I'M NOT HUNGRY. - ALL RIGHT. HEY, NOW... DON'T YOU GO GETTING DEPRESSED ON US, HUH? WE WORKED THREE LONG HARD YEARS TO END SOBER. DON'T MESS IT UP. - BUDDY, I'M FINE. YOU GO OUT AND HAVE YOURSELF A GOOD DINNER.

IF YOU WANT TO HATE ME, YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO. - IT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY TOO. - WELL NOW, MRS. MATHEWS, WOULD YOU AND SUNNY CARE TO JOIN ME ON A SHORT TRIP? - WHERE TO? - TO GO SEE GINGER. - SHE SHOULD BE IN HER RECOVERY STALL RIGHT UP HERE. SHE ALREADY HAD HER SURGERY SO IT'S OKAY. GO ON IN. SAY HI. - IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN TOUCH HER. JUST BE CAREFUL. A LITTLE SORE. - GINGER, IT'S ME. IT'S ME. - BEN, WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR THIS? - DOC SAID GINGER WAS SUCH AN INTERESTING CASE THAT HE DID IT AS AN EXPERIMENT SO, IT'S NOT GONNA COST A PENNY. HEY DOC, THIS HERE IS KATHLEEN MATHEWS. HER DAUGHTER IS SUNNY. - HOWDY. NICE TO MEET ALL OF YOU. - DOC, TELL US WHAT YOU FOUND. - AS IT TURNS OUT, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE FETLOCK BUT FORTUNATELY MOST OF IT WAS SOFT TISSUE. I RECONSTRUCTED TWO TENDONS AND REMOVED SOME BONE CHIPS FROM THE JOINT. - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - THAT MEANS THAT I WOULD GIVE HER ABOUT 30 DAYS OR SO BEFORE YOU RIDE HER, BUT SHE SHOULD BE FINE. - GINGER, DID YOU HEAR THAT? YOU'RE GONNA BE THE FASTEST HORSY IN THE WHOLE WORLD. YES, YOU ARE. - OKAY, I THINK IT'S TIME WE WENT HOME. - I THINK GINGER COULD USE A LITTLE REST. - OKAY. BYE, GINGER. I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY? - WHAT DO YOU SAY? - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. - WHY DON'T YOU GO ON AHEAD. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN JUST A MINUTE. DOC, THERE'S 2,000. I'LL HAVE THE OTHER EIGHT NEXT MONTH. - THAT'S A DEAL. - THANKS. THANKS FOR PLAYING ALONG. - NOT A PROBLEM, BEN. - GINGER LOOKS GREAT. - WELL, DOC SAYS GINGER CAN COME HOME IN A FEW DAYS. - OKAY, I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. SUNNY CAN'T RIDE HER. - BUT MOM, THAT'S NOT FAIR. - SUNNY, THAT'S THE END OF THIS DISCUSSION. YOU AND I HAVE AN AGREEMENT. - IF Y'ALL AREN'T DOING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. - I'M SORRY, WE HAVE PLANS. - NO, WE DON'T. - EXCUSE ME? - LOOK, IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

MATHEWS, I JUST WANTED SUNNY TO SEE A REAL RODEO. - WOULD YOU JUST TAKE US HOME PLEASE. - YOU KNOW, EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME WHEN A KID LOVES A HORSE THIS MUCH AND WANTS TO RIDE SO BAD, THERE'S NOTHING ANYBODY CAN DO EXCEPT TO LOVE THEM, GUIDE THEM AND STAY THE HECK OUT OF THE WAY. - THAT WAS FUN, HUH MOM? - YEAH, GREAT FUN. - HEY BUDDY.

BUT SHE'S MY PRIDE AND JOY NOW. - I APPRECIATE THAT. - WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE WITH YOUR TEETH IN YOUR MOUTH. WHAT IS IT? - I'M FINISHED CLEANING THE STALLS. - DID YOU FILL THE WATER BARRELS. - YEP. WHAT ARE THESE? - SOME OLD JUNK I KEEP AROUND. - WHERE DID YOU BUY THIS ONE? - I WON IT. I WAS YOUNGER. I USED TO DO RODEOING. - ARE THESE REAL GOLD? - 18 KARAT SOLID GOLD. - YOU MUST REALLY LOVE THEM. - YEAH. I WOULDN'T TRADE THOSE SPURS FOR ANYTHING. - WHY'D YOU QUIT BEING A COWBOY? WHO ARE THEY? - THE UGLY ONE'S ME. DALLAS YOU KNOW. - WHO'S THE LITTLE GIRL? - GO ON, GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE! GO FEED THE HORSES BEFORE THEY CLIMB OUT OF THEIR STALLS. GO. - BEN, WE NEED TO TALK. - SAY WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, DALLAS. DON'T SUGARCOAT IT OR NOTHING. - MELINDA WON'T BE TAKING LESSONS FROM YOU ANYMORE. - YOUR MONEY. BY THE WAY, I SAW MELINDA'S NEW HORSE AT THE RODEO THE OTHER NIGHT. STEEL'S A GOOD HORSE. - WE'RE GONNA STABLE HIM AT OUR PLACE. - THAT'S SWELL. - I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T WANT MELINDA RIDING OVER HERE WITH HER FRIENDS. - MELINDA CAN RIDE OVER HERE ANY TIME SHE PLEASES. - BEN? ARE YOU FEELING OKAY? - DALLAS, YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. DON'T YOU DO THE SAME THING. - SHE CAN MAKE IT TO THE TOP, BEN. AND I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS THERE. - I SAW HER AT THE RODEO. SHE STANDS A CHANCE. IF YOU DON'T RIDE HER SO HARD. - REALLY, BEN. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS COMING FROM YOU. YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A CACTUS COVERED MARSHMALLOW. IF YOU WANT TO WIN, YOU'VE GOT TO GRAB IT. NOBODY'S GONNA HAND IT TO YOU. AND YOU THINK OUR PAST TO MAKE A POINT. IT'S CHEAP, BEN. MELINDA'S GOING TO BE A WINNER. I'M NOTHING LIKE YOU. - YOU'RE RIGHT, DALLAS. - HOW IS THAT, BEN? - YOU'RE USING MELINDA TO MAKE YOUR POINT. - HEY THERE. - HI. WHATCHA DOING? - GOOD COWBOY TAKES CARE OF HIS TACK. - I'M DONE. - I FIGURED. - YOU KNOW MY MOM IS REALLY MAD AT YOU. - I FIGURED THAT TOO. - SHE DOESN'T WANT ME TO RIDE. - YEAH. SHE'S AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT. - COULD YOU TALK TO HER? - WELL, THAT'S BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MOM. SEE, I ALREADY STUCK MY NOSE IN WHERE IT DON'T BELONG. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING THOUGH, YOU WANT TO RIDE GINGER, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO YOUR THERAPY. IT TAKES GOOD STRONG LEGS TO RIDE A HORSE. GIMPY ONE LIKE YOURS ISN'T GONNA CUT IT. - I'M GONNA RIDE GINGER. - YEAH? WE'LL SEE. - HE'S NOT A DOCTOR. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR LEG. - YES, HE DOES. HE SAID MY LEG WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH. HE SAID I'LL HAVE TO DO MY THERAPY IF I WANT TO RIDE. YOU JUST DON'T LIKE HIM. - I DON'T DISLIKE HIM, SUNNY. I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM MEDDLING IN OUR BUSINESS. - HE'S JUST TRYING TO HELP ME. - YOU ARE NOT RIDING AND THAT'S FINAL. - HI. I JUST SENT SUNNY DOWN TO PHYSICAL THERAPY. NOW SHE WANTS TO RIDE THE HORSE AND BEN'S GOT HER BELIEVING SHE CAN DO IT. - BEN AGAIN. - I WOULD REALLY FEEL BETTER IF YOU WERE INVOLVED. - WELL, I'LL GO OUT THERE AND CHECK ON THINGS IF YOU'D LIKE THAT. - WOULD YOU DO THAT HUGH? [CHUCKLES] - WHAT? - YOU CALLED ME HUGH. - WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HER? SHE'S GONE CRAZY. - IN A GOOD WAY, I HOPE. - 110 PERCENT, DOC. I MEAN, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SLOW HER DOWN. SHE'S BURNING UP ALL OF OUR MACHINES. LOOK AT HER. - BEN! BEN! BEN! BEN! BEN! DR. OLSON IS GONNA COME OUT AND SEE GINGER. IF HE THINKS IT'S OKAY, I CAN RIDE. - IS THAT SO? - I'VE BEEN DOING MY THERAPY JUST LIKE YOU SAID. - THAT A GIRL. - AND JESSE SAYS IF I KEEP WORKING, I MIGHT BE STRONG ENOUGH BY THE TIME GINGER'S WELL. - I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE ME YOU'RE NOT GONNA TRY TO RIDE GINGER UNTIL I SAY IT'S OKAY. - I PROMISE. MY MOM SAYS YOU'RE A BAD INFLUENCE ON ME. - IS THAT SO? WHAT ELSE SHE SAY? - SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY YOU LOOK. - IS THAT A FACT? - YEP. I GOTTA GO. MY MOM'S COOKING DINNER. BYE BYE GINGER. - BYE. - GINGER, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THOUGHT SO. - HEY, COWBOY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - DALLAS, YOU TOLD ME TO STOP BY. - BEN? WELL, I'LL BE! IS THAT REALLY YOU? - DALLAS, WHAT IS IT YOU WANT? - JOHNNY'S GOING TO TEACH MELINDA. - I SAID I'D TEACH HER IF YOU AGREED, BEN. I AIN'T TRYING TO CUT IN ON YOUR DEAL. - YOU'RE WELCOME TO HER, JOHNNY. - ARE YOU SURE? - JOHNNY, YOU'D BE DOING ME A FAVOR. DALLAS HERE WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE ME TO DRINK, WEREN'T YOU DALLAS? - NOW DON'T EXAGGERATE, BEN. WE DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE ALL THE TIME, BUT THERE AREN'T ANY HARD FEELINGS. - DALLAS, ONE DAY YOU'LL MAKE SOMEBODY A GREAT HUSBAND. - FUNNY. - HEY ROCKY, WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN TO THE RESERVOIR AND TAKE A SWIM. YOU WANNA COME WITH US? - GEE, I'D LOVE TO. BUT I CAN'T. I'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF CHORES TO DO. THANKS ANYWAY. - WELL MAYBE NEXT TIME. - HI, MY NAME'S SUSAN, AND THIS IS WHERE MY HORSE POKEY LIVES. YOU WANT SOME HELP, SUNNY? - SURE, THANKS. I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING HER TO SAY SOMETHING MEAN AGAIN. - NO ONE EVER STOOD UP TO HER BEFORE. SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT ALL WEEK. SAID YOU TACKLED HER RIGHT INTO THE GROUND. SHE CALLS YOU ROCKY LIKE THE BOXER. - THAT'S WHAT SHE MEANT. - HAVE YOU EVER MET DALLAS? - I THINK I'VE SEEN HER OUT IN THE RING WITH MELINDA. WHY IS SHE SO HARD ON HER? - YOU WANT TO KNOW THE STORY? - SURE. - WELL, THIS IS WHAT MY MOM TOLD ME. BEN MARRIED DALLAS A YEAR BEFORE BEN'S DAUGHTER SHERRY DIED. - THAT MUST BE THE LITTLE GIRL I SAW IN THE PICTURE WITH DALLAS AND BEN. - AND RIGHT AFTER SHERRY DIED, DALLAS AND BEN GOT A DIVORCE. MEANWHILE, DALLAS' OWN DAUGHTER, SHANNON, ELOPED AND HAD A BABY, AND SHE AND HER HUSBAND MOVED TO SOUTH AMERICA, AND THEY LEFT THE BABY WITH DALLAS. - MELINDA IS DALLAS' GRANDDAUGHTER? - UH-HUH, ANYWAYS, MOM SAYS DALLAS BLAMES HERSELF FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO SHANNON ON ACCOUNT SHE WAS THIS BIG RODEO QUEEN AND WAS NEVER HOME TO TAKE CARE OF HER. SO WHEN MELINDA CAME ALONG, IT WAS LIKE A SECOND CHANCE TO DO IT RIGHT. - SOUNDS LIKE MELINDA'S GOT A HARD ROW TO HOE. - WHAT? - WELL, THAT'S WHAT BEN SAID. MELINDA'S GOT A HARD ROW TO HOE. - OH, OKAY. - GOOD GIRL, GOOD GIRL. NOT BAD FOR BEING LAID UP FOR FIVE MONTHS, HUH? - WOW. - SHE'S LOOKING GOOD NOW, BEN. WHAT'S SHE GONNA LOOK LIKE WHEN SHE GETS IN SHAPE? - BETTER AND BETTER, RIGHT, SUNNY? - YEAH. - NOT BAD. YEAH. - BEN, SHE'S FABULOUS. - WOW. - SHE'S AS FRISKY AS A YOUNG FILLY. - COME ON IN, BEEN EXPECTING YOU. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? - WELL, YOU'RE HERE TO TELL ME THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO SUNNY, YOU'RE GOING TO BLAME ME, IS THAT RIGHT? - SOMETHING LIKE THAT. - LOOK, MISS MATTHEWS, I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WITH YOU. YOU WANT TO BLAME ME IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, THAT'S FINE. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. - YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO. YOU LOOK BETTER WITHOUT THE HAIR. - WHAT ABOUT A SADDLE? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET HER RIDE BAREBACK, ARE YOU? - NOT HARDLY. - EASY THERE, GINGER. HEY, SUNNY, FROM NOW ON THIS WILL BE YOUR SADDLE. - WAIT A MINUTE, BEN. - NOW, MRS. MATTHEWS, IT'S JUST AN OLD KID'S SADDLE, I DON'T HAVE ANY USE FOR IT. SUNNY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IT. - SUNNY, I WANT YOU TO WATCH ME DO THIS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW. - SUNNY, YOU REMEMBER ALL THE THINGS I TOLD YOU. - UH-HUH. - NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM ONE MORE TIME BEFORE YOU TURN YOU LOOSE. - OKAY. - ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP HERE, COME ON. HERE YOU GO, READY? - UH-HUH. - UP WE GO. IN THE STIRRUPS. - OKAY. - HERE'S THE REIN, HONEY. - THERE YOU GO, KEEP THOSE HEELS DOWN. ALL RIGHT, SHOW ME HOW YOU HOLD THOSE REINS. GOOD, KEEP A GOOD GRIP ON THOSE REINS. YOU DROP THOSE, SHE'LL TAKE OFF. SHOW ME HOW YOU TURN TO THE RIGHT. GOOD, TURN TO THE LEFT. REAL GOOD, SHOW ME HOW YOU STOP HER, GOOD. DON'T BE AFRAID TO PULL BACK HARD. SHE'S A BIG HORSE, SHE CAN HANDLE IT. - AND IF YOU RUN INTO SOME TROUBLE, YOU JUST HOLD ONTO THAT SADDLE HORN. - AND SUNNY, IF YOUR LEG STARTS TO HURT, YOU JUST STOP, RIGHT? - READY TO GIVE HER A TRY? ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, COME ON GINGER. THERE YOU GO. - HONEY, YOU BE CAREFUL. - SO FAR SO GOOD. - YEAH. HOW ABOUT THAT? - UH-HUH. - SHE'S A DARLING. - LOOK, LOOK, I'M RIDING. - SUNNY, SLOW DOWN. - KEEP IT SLOW, GAL. - BEN, SHE WANTS TO GO, I CAN FEEL IT. - NO, NO, KEEP A TIGHT GRIP ON THOSE REINS. YOU'RE BE READY TO RUN HER YET. KEEP THE REINS TIGHT. - SUNNY, YOU LISTEN TO BEN, DO YOU HEAR ME? - YES, MOM. - SUNNY, SUNNY TAKE IT EASY. SUNNY! - SUNNY, SLOW DOWN! - SUNNY! SUNNY! EASY, GINGER. GINGER, GINGER. YOUNG LADY, YOU CLIMB DOWN OFF THAT HORSE RIGHT NOW! NOW YOU JUST MADE THREE BIG MISTAKES. NUMBER ONE, YOU RAN GINGER BEFORE SHE WAS WARMED UP. YOU COULD HAVE CRIPPLED HER ALL OVER AGAIN. NUMBER TWO, YOU DISOBEYED ME. NUMBER THREE, YOU SCARED YOUR MOM. NOW, I THINK YOU GOT IN APOLOGIES TO MAKE HERE. - I'M SORRY, MOM. I'M SORRY, BEN. AND I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY, GINGER. I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU, HONEST. - YEAH, WELL, JUST SO YOU DON'T FORGET, I WANT YOU TO TAKE GINGER AND WALK HER AROUND THIS ARENA FOR ONE HOUR, YOU UNDERSTAND? - YES, SIR. - ALL RIGHT. GET TO IT. - A LITTLE ROUGH ON HER, WEREN'T YOU? - YOU EVER BEEN UP ON A HORSE? - THEN YOU STICK WITH THE DOCTORING, AND I'LL HANDLE THE RIDING. - BEN? SHE DID REALLY WELL OUT THERE, DIDN'T SHE? - BUDDY, YOU EVER SEEN ANYONE RIDE LIKE THAT FIRST TIME OUT OF THE BOX? - NOT IN 65 YEARS OF RIDING HORSES. - SHE DID DARN GOOD. - COME ON, MELINDA, GET OUT THERE, HONEY! ATTA GIRL. - HOW'S MELINDA DOING, DALLAS? - SHE'S GETTING THERE. - COME ON! - GOOD FOR WHAT AILS YOU. WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT YOU'RE FIRING BEN. - WHO TOLD YOU? - NOTHING'S SECRET AROUND HERE, DARLING. I THINK GETTING RID OF BEN IS A MISTAKE. - AND WHY IS THAT? - BECAUSE BEN WILL STAND UP TO YOU, AND JOHNNY WON'T. - NOW DRIVE TO THE BARREL, DRIVE! - STAY DOWN IN THE SADDLE! YOU WERE TOO HIGH IN THE TURNS. MELINDA'S GOING TO WIN THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU CAN BANK ON IT. - I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. - GET OVER HERE, MELINDA. - MORNING MR. HATHAWAY. - HOWDY. - NO MORE GOOFING OFF. I WANT YOU OUT HERE SIX HOURS A DAY AND I'M CANCELING YOUR WEEK AT CAMP. - BUT MOM, ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE GOING. - USE YOUR HEAD, MELINDA. NOW DO YOU WANT TO GO TO CAMP OR BE A STATE CHAMPION, HUH? - ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY SOME BIG CIRCLES, NICE AND WIDE. KEEP THE HEELS DOWN. HEELS DOWN, SUNNY. GOOD, GOOD GRIP ON THE REINS. JUST RELAX INTO THE POSTING, JUST RELAX. GOOD. WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING PRETTY DARN GOOD. I TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL GO AHEAD AND SET OUT THE BARRELS. YOU TROT GINGER THROUGH FIVE TIMES AT A TROT, YOU UNDERSTAND? - OKAY. - ALL RIGHT. - HI. - HI. - BEN'S TEACHING ME TO RIDE. - GATES ARE HARD. POKEY DOESN'T LIKE TO DO ANYTHING BUT WALK AND RUN. ESPECIALLY COMING BACK TO THE CORRAL. - GINGER DON'T LIKE TO TROT. - YOU GONNA ENTER THE GYMKHANA SATURDAY? IT'S ONLY A PRACTICE ONE. - I DON'T THINK I'M GOOD ENOUGH. - YOU LOOK GOOD ENOUGH TO ME. THEY LET ANYONE ENTER, EVEN ME AND POKEY. - BEN, CAN I RIDE IN THE GYMKHANA SATURDAY? - WELL, I DON'T KNOW, YOU WANT TO RIDE? - SUSAN ASKED ME TO. - WELL, IT'S FINE BY ME, BUT YOU BETTER ASK YOUR MOM. - OKAY. - COOL. I GOTTA GO, OKAY, BYE. - BYE. - SUNNY... WHOA, GINGER. ALL RIGHT, NOW, I WANT YOU TO RUN THE BARRELS FIVE TIMES AT A... - A TROT. - AT A TROT, VERY GOOD. AND THEN COOL HER DOWN AND BRUSH HER OUT. - YES, SIR, COACH. - GET TO WORK, KID. - ANNOUNCER: FOLKS, BEN AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TURN OUT TODAY. NOW, WE HOPE YOU'RE ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME. OUR NEXT MILE RACER IS A NEWCOMER, MISS SUNNY MATTHEWS IN HER VERY FIRST COMPETITION ON HER OWN HORSE, GINGER. GIVE THEM BOTH A BIG WELCOME. [APPLAUSE] NOW, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS, FOLKS. 16.2 FOR SUNNY MATTHEWS, NOW HOW ABOUT THAT? - WHOA, GINGER. WOW, THAT WAS A GREAT RIDE, SUNNY. - SWEETHEART, YOU DID BEAUTIFULLY. HOW DOES YOUR LEG FEEL? - GREAT. - GOOD. - GINGER'S LOOKING GREAT. HERE, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HER AND COOL HER DOWN FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES, WALK AROUND. - SEE YOU IN A FEW MINUTES. - OKAY. - THAT WAS A GOOD RUN. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD RIDE THAT WELL. - SHE ONLY STARTED RIDING LAST WEEK. - REALLY? ARE YOU GOING TO ENTER THE REGIONALS? - I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BESIDES, YOUR RIDE WAS WAY BETTER THAN MINE. - OH, WELL, SEE YOU AROUND. - BYE. - WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL WITH THE REGIONALS? - $2500 TO THE WINNER, AND WHOEVER WINS THE REGIONALS, GOES TO STATE. AND IT'S $50,000 THERE. - I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT STUFF. I JUST LOVE TO RIDE GINGER. - SHE COULD BE TROUBLE, MELINDA. - MAYBE SHE JUST HAD A LUCKY RUN. - I DON'T THINK SO. SHE SADDLED THAT HORSE TOO WELL. - SHE SAID SHE WASN'T GOING TO ENTER. - YOU WANNA BANK ON THAT? - NO. - I WANT YOU TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER. YOU CAN DO THAT, CAN'T YOU? - I GUESS. - DON'T GUESS, DO IT. - I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE FOR SUNNY. GINGER, THE SADDLE, EVERYTHING. - MY PLEASURE. - WE DIDN'T GET OFF TO A VERY GOOD START. I WAS HOPING WE COULD START AGAIN. - THAT WOULD BE FINE BY ME, MRS. MATTHEWS. - WOULD YOU STOP CALLING ME MRS. MATTHEWS? EVERYBODY CALLS ME KATHY. - KATHY. - GOOD. - YOU KNOW, SUNNY DID GREAT OUT THERE. - IS SHE REALLY THAT GOOD? - YEP, YEAH, SHE'S JUST REALLY THAT GOOD. - WOW. - NOW, THEN, I DO HAVE A RATHER SPECIAL BRANDY TO ROUND OUT THE EVENING IF YOU CARE FOR A GLASS? - OH, I WOULD LOVE SOME. - GOOD. - DINNER WAS AMAZING. I HAD NO IDEA YOU COULD COOK LIKE THAT. - WELL, I WENT TO FRANCE TO SCHOOL THERE FOR A YEAR WHEN I WAS YOUNG. THE FAMILY I LIVED WITH HAD A GOURMET CHEF, SO I MADE A POINT OF LEARNING EVERYTHING I COULD FROM HIM. THERE WE GO. - THANK YOU. - SO, YOU LIKE ANTIQUES? - YEAH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. I'D BE AFRAID I'D BREAK SOMETHING, THOUGH. MUST BE WORTH A FORTUNE. - YES, A LOT OF THEM ARE HANDED DOWN TO ME FROM MY FAMILY. SOME OF THE OTHER LITTLE KNICK KNACKS I PICKED UP ON MY TRAVELS. ALL MUSEUM QUALITY, THOUGH. - NOW, THAT HORSE, SUNNY WOULD LOVE. - WELL, I BET SHE WOULD. THIS LITTLE BLIGHTER COST ME A FORTUNE. - BLIGHTER? [GIGGLING] YOU KNOW, BEN TOLD ME SHE DID REALLY WELL AT THE GYMKHANA. - YES, YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT BEN. DO I NEED TO FEEL JEALOUS? - OF COURSE NOT. - KATHY, PLEASE. KATHY, I GREW UP IN A BIG HOUSE, A LOT BIGGER THAN THIS ONE, ACTUALLY, BUT IT NEVER GOT LONELY BECAUSE MY PARENTS AND MY BROTHERS AND MY SISTERS WERE ALWAYS THERE. THE THING IS, A HOUSE DOESN'T BECOME A HOME UNTIL THERE'S THE RIGHT WOMAN AND THE RIGHT FAMILY LIVING IN IT. TO US. - ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHEN YOU WANT HER TO GO ALL OUT, YOU JUST TOUCH HER WITH THOSE SPURS. NOT TOO HARD, SHE'S REAL SENSITIVE. Y'ALL SET? - UH-HUH. - LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. - OKAY. - LET'S SEE HOW THIS GOES, HUH? - TWIRL HER AROUND. ALL RIGHTY, ALL OUT, HERE YOU GO, HERE YOU GO. ♪IF YOU EVER LOSE TRACK OF ME... ♪YOU KNOW THAT I'M THE ONE... ♪YOU'LL FIND ME WORKING EVERY DAY... ♪JUST HOWLING AT THE SUN... ♪WELL, HOT AIN'T REALLY COOL TO ME... ♪BUT THERE'S NO SHADE UNDER THE GUN... ♪I TAKE MY CHANCES ANYWHERE... ♪WHEN I'M HOWLING AT THE SUN... ♪HOWLING AT THE SUN... - ALL RIGHT, NOW, KICK IT AND BRING HER HOME, BRING HER HOME. GOOD, GOOD. - WHOA, WHOA. - 17 SECONDS. - SHE WENT FASTER. - YEAH. WELL, SPURS ARE A GOOD THING, SO LONG AS YOU DON'T OVERUSE THEM. - SUNNY, WHEN YOU'RE PRACTICING, YOU DON'T LET NOTHING DISTRACT YOU. WE'LL TALK TO THEM LATER. - OKAY. - OKAY NOW, WE HAVE TO CORRECT A LITTLE PROBLEM. WHEN YOU'RE GOING AROUND THOSE BARRELS, YOU'RE LEANING A LITTLE TOO FAR INTO THE TURN. THAT'S THROWING GINGER OFF BALANCE, ALL RIGHT? YOU WANT TO SIT UP STRAIGHT IN YOUR SADDLE. WHEN YOU'RE RACING, THAT SADDLE HORN, BELLY BUTTON, BACK OF THE SADDLE. KEEP IT IN LINE THE WHOLE TIME, YOU UNDERSTAND? - OKAY, LIKE THIS? - YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT. - EVEN WHEN I'M GOING AROUND THE BARREL? - THAT'S ANY TIME YOU'RE RIDING. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRAY ANOTHER RUN.

CAN'T YOU BORROW IT OR SOMETHING? - WELL, I'M TRYING. I'M SELLING SOME STOCK AND GETTING READY OF THE OLD TRUCK. - I DON'T WANT TO CONFISCATE THIS GIRL'S HORSE. I TELL YOU WHAT I CAN DO. I'LL GIVE YOU 90 DAYS, BUT THAT'S ALL. - I APPRECIATE THAT. DID A HECK OF A JOB ON GINGER. - THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. - I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU STOP BY ANY FRIDAY AND WATCH GINGER RUN THOSE BARRELS, HUH? - I'LL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT, ALL RIGHT. - THANKS AGAIN. - 16.3, NOT BAD, MELINDA. - BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. YESTERDAY, SUNNY RODE A 16.1. - MELINDA, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? - YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SAID BEN WASN'T TEACHING ME RIGHT. - STAY ON THAT HORSE, YOU'RE NOT FINISHED.

HIYA! - I HAVE TO BEAT HER AT THE REGIONAL RODEO, OR I DON'T GO TO STATE, RIGHT? - NO, THE TWO FASTEST REGIONAL RIDERS GO TO STAY, NOT JUST THE WINNER, WHY? - I GOTTA WIN, I GOTTA WIN THEM BOTH. - MOM? I NEED A HUNDRED DOLLARS. - WHAT FOR? - I HAVE TO RIDE IN THE REGIONAL RODEO, THE BARREL RACE. - THAT'S NONSENSE, YOU'RE NOT READY TO RIDE IN A RODEO. - I'M BETTER THAN EVERYONE, BUT MELINDA, EVEN BEN SAID SO. - HONEY, THOSE GIRLS HAVE BEEN RIDING FOR YEARS. DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD WAIT FOR A YEAR OR TWO? - I HAVE TO RIDE THIS YEAR. - HAVE YOU ASKED BEN THINKS ABOUT IT? - NO. - SUNNY, THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIDING GINGER UP AT BEN'S PLACE AND RIDING IN A RODEO. BESIDES, I DON'T THINK I CAN SPARE A HUNDRED DOLLARS. - IF I WIN, I GET $5,000. I COULD PAY YOU BACK. - ANNOUNCER: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE SOUTHWEST REGIONAL RODEO.

BEN? - HUH. - WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS STEEL FASTER THAN GINGER? - NOT BY A LONG SHOT. GINGER CAN'T RUN FULL OUT IF YOU'RE MAKING MISTAKES. - WHAT DID I DO WRONG? - WELL, YOU WERE FINE UP UNTIL THAT LAST BARREL, BUT WHEN GINGER CAME AROUND IT, YOU'RE STILL LEANING IN A LITTLE TOO FAR, THREW HER OFF BALANCE. JUST SIT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR SADDLE. - CAN YOU WATCH ME, PLEASE, AND SEE IF THIS IS OKAY? - WELL, SURE, KID, BUT TAKE IT EASY. NOBODY EXPECT YOU TO BE PERFECT. - GINGER DOES. - GINGER DOES, HUH? - HEY, PRETTY LADY. WANT A RIDE IN MY NEW CAR? - IT'S BEAUTIFUL. - HOP IN, I'LL TAKE YOU FOR A SPIN.

YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU DON'T NEED HER PERMISSION. - SHE'S A PART OF THIS, TOO. IF WE WERE TO GET MARRIED, YOU WOULD BE HER NEW DAD. HUGH, I JUST DON'T THINK I'M READY. - OH, WELL, YOU KEEP IT. IT MIGHT HELP MY CAUSE. - HEY, SUNNY? SUNNY, PACK IT IN, IT'S STARTING TO RAIN. - BEN, IT'S JUST DRIZZLING, COME ON. GINGER'S NOT EVEN WARMED UP. - GOOD, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT COOLING HER DOWN. WE DON'T RUN THE BARRELS IN THE RAIN, COME ON, PACK IT IN. - YES, SIR, COME ON. - HEY, SUNNY, I SAID PACK IT IN! SUNNY! SUNNY! [THUNDER AND LIGHTNING] NO! SUNNY! NO, NOT AGAIN! NO! SUNNY! SWEETIE, SWEETHEART? BUDDY, GET OUT HERE! SWEETHEART. BEN WHERE IS SHE, WHAT HAPPENED? - SHE WAS OUT RIDING IN THE RAIN, GINGER SLIPPED AND FELL ON HER. THEY'RE WORKING ON HER. - WHERE? THIS IS YOUR FAULT. I DIDN'T WANT HER TO RIDE, I KNEW SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN. - SORRY. - JUST STAY AWAY FROM US! - SUNNY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - I'M OKAY. - SHE HAS A BRUISED KNEE AND SOME ABRASIONS, AND SHE TOOK A GOOD HIT ON THE NOGGIN, BUT I DON'T SEE ANY SIGN OF CONCUSSION. - SHE'S GOT A PIN IN HER RIGHT LEG. - I CHECKED IT, EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE. - MOM, IS GINGER OKAY? - I'M SURE SHE'S FINE. - WHERE'S BEN? - I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR BEN TO BE WITH US RIGHT NOW. - MOM? BEN TOLD ME NOT TO RIDE IN THE RAIN. I DID IT ANYWAY. I DISOBEYED HIM. I'M SORRY. I REALLY AM. - CAN I TAKE HER HOME NOW? - SURE, GOOD LUCK, SUNNY. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. - YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT. LET'S GO. - BEN? I CAME TO APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT I SAID. IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT, I JUST WANTED SOMEONE TO BLAME. - NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE, MRS. MATTHEWS, YOU WERE RIGHT. HOW'S SUNNY DOING? - WELL, SHE'S GOT A FEW SCRATCHES, AND SHE'S PRETTY DOWN IN THE MOUTH, BUT IT'S NOTHING THAT A RIDE ON HER HORSE AND A HUG FROM HER COACH WON'T CURE. - YEAH, I'M GOOD FOR THE HUG, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE DOING ANY MORE COACHING. - DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, SHE NEEDS YOU. - YOU KNOW, I HAD A DAUGHTER SHERRY, AND SHE WAS KILLED WHEN A HORSE FELL ON HER IN THE RAIN. JUST ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS SUNNY. AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY SHE WAS OUT RIDING A HORSE IN THE RAIN? BECAUSE... SHE KNEW I WANTED HER TO WIN. - I'M SORRY, I HAD NO IDEA. - IT'S NOT SOMETHING I TALK ABOUT. - BEN, WHAT HAPPENED TO SUNNY WAS AN ACCIDENT. YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF. - NOT OPEN TO DISCUSSION. - BEN TAYLOR, DON'T YOU DARE WALK AWAY FROM ME, THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT OVER! I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER, I AM.
