My name is Stone, Stone Fury. This is my town, Chi-Town, Chicago, Illinois. The land of big hearts, big shoulders.. .. and broken Dreams And cut. Some say I'm the best private.. .. dick there ever was. But that was a long time ago. The Stone Man has seen better days. I'm out of shape. I'm out of touch.. .. and I'm simply out of time. I need a break, and soon. But there's trouble brewing up. Stone can feel it. But.. .. and cut. Oh shit, I'm sorry. I think you're adding too many.. .. colors to a painting. You want another one? Can I see the playback on that? We don't have playback. We don't have any video equipment at all here. Okay, so you just.. Yeah. All right, so let's try it again. Let's do it again. If you need another one, you're the star. Let's do another one. I have an attitude. I'm like a young.. .. Marlon Brando. Unleash the fury. Ah, trapped like a rat now, huh? Now let's see who the bad guy really is. The way I stole the scene.. .. was just my... my expressions. Trapped like a rat.. .. now let's see who the bad guy REALLY is. And cut.

I like this. Yep, today.. .. is the day, for stardom. If you do well this audition.. .. you are gonna get this role.. .. and you can be a movie star. Could be? But if you screw this up.. You're going to be working at that print shop.. ..until the day.. you.. die. - Yeah, I die. What if you become a star? If?

Yes, there's a major mistake. - I think.. .. there is and we're as upset.. .. about it as you are. I'm so sorry.. Get the fuck out of my dressing room! What makes me such a good actor.. .. well, alright.. .. I can't.. .. lie about this, okay? My acting coach.. Ivan Markota, from the Van Mar Academy.. .. taught me some tricks.. .. in the very beginning of, uh.. .. when I was going to his class.. .. that just won't leave, you know? Always remember the first couple of words.. .. in the line and then the whole.. .. the whole.. .. sentence or the whole line should just.. .. come right to your mind. For example.. .. another day in paradise.. .. I just looked at the two words: another day. What.. .. what other two words are going to come at you.. .. when you read.. .. another day? What, another day in hell? No, no, no, no, no.. Another day in paradise. And remember after you.. .. after you drink it down.. .. your first line? I forget.. - Another day in paradise. Here we go, quiet please.. gotta go folks. Let's go. - Marker. Maybe go faster. Pour those with both hands at the same time.. .. pizza, beer.. .. come on Stone hurry up. Drink it up fast.. .. we got a minute and half film left.. .. hurry up, all right.. Don't forget your line. That's another fucking day in paradise. And.. cut. I hope that's a print.. .. cause I don't wanna do that one again. Give me one where you take it down and you go.. .. another day in paradise, you know? Don't say fuck.. If we end up selling this.. .. to the Disney Channel or something like that. Marker. - And.. act. Some beer in there.. Drink it up.. there you go.. .. more, more, more, more, more.. Don't forget your line. Another day in paradise. OK, let's cut. That was great, Perry. - Oh God.. .. drinking that a second time.. .. please.. no more.. You wanna do it again, Perry? - No!

Oh God I don't want to explode while I'm.. .. getting lusty over her. Alright, final touches. Look at this guy he's handling her.. He's wardrobe it's.. I'm used to it. - I'm like a doctor. See her looks are a 10 plus. Watch my eyes and then.. .. lick your lips slowly.. But after I know her personality.. .. and get to know her as a lady.. .. she could be the girl that I would take.. .. to the Academy Awards. Am I moving around too much? Yeah, yeah, cause it.. yeah.. .. so once you're on a mark, stay there. I don't.. look, Bert.. .. you're a great guy I really appreciate all this.. .. just bring it to my trailer, please? I'd appreciate it. But they asked for lunch. - No. The big scene I'm doing today is um.. .. sex. Did I put the Spanish Fly in there? Spanish Fly.. .. it's gonna all get inside Jiggly Wrigley and then.. .. bang, bang, bang. I took the Spanish Fly thinking that, you know.. .. I'll.. my dick'll get hard.. .. in like three seconds.. .. all she needs to do is start touching me and.. .. bam, it'll be hard as.. .. hard as a fucking uh, uh.. .. diamond.. .. cutter or whatever. Jiggly pulls off her sw.. .. her sweater.. .. reveals two.. .. creamy breasts.. .. the Stone sets them free with his teeth like an animal.. .. so more or less.. .. it's like I'm biting off her bra. Have I had sex with a woman.. .. to where I've been off her bra and stuff? Many times. Many times.. And then.. .. you start to undress me and then I start to undress you.. .. and then we undress ourselves.. .. or each other. You know what I'm saying? - Okay. And.. act. I knew it when she walked in.. .. this doll that was a double scoop of trouble.. .. looking for a cone. Hello Mr. Fury. I'm Jiggly.. I ain't blind. .. Jiggly Wrigley.. .. I'm the heiress to a large chewing gum.. .. fortune, I won't say which. What's this got to do with me? I need your help. Forget it, the Stone Man's out of the sports P.I game. But only you can stop Chicago's greatest.. .. sports treasures from being stolen. Like I said doll.. .. I gave it up a long time ago. You don't sound so sure. Please Stone.. .. I'll do anything. Anything? - Anything. And cut. Alright folks.. .. we're about to do a uh.. .. a very graphic and very sensual love scene. If you're offended easily.. .. I would ask you to leave now.

Perry, I'm trying to help you what did I do? You're talking to me. Perry, are you OK in there? - Let me use the bathroom OK? Are you OK? I heard something. - I'm fine. What was that noise? What do you think stupid? I'm not stupid, what was that noise? My ass.. farting. Oh I'm so.. I apologize. No, I mean you sounded sick.. .. and I thought you were injured or something. Perry, what are you doing in there that you can't talk to me? I'm taking a shit, stupid! I'm stupid? You had a chance to have a love scene.. .. with a beautiful woman and you ask for a stunt double? And I'm stupid?! I didn't ask for a stunt double for the love scene. You asked for a stunt double.. For the fucking garbage dumpster.. .. not for the love scene. - Perry. A love scene is a stunt. You asked for this stunt double.. .. love scene is a stunt.. .. so you in turn asked.. .. for a stunt double for the love scene. I did not ask for the.. ! Then who did?! Shut the fuck up, you're an idiot. I got your food. I don't want food. You said you were hungry. - I don't want food! I heard you tell Don, you're hungry. And then I went.. - Bring it back to the.. .. just bring it back to the room I'm not.. .. fucking hungry, I'm pissed. What're you pissed about? That asshole keeps talking to me.. .. while I'm trying to.. .. take a shit. So you don't want the food? - No.. bye. Do you want me to save it for you? Bring it to the room. What going on? - The stunt double's fired. When the scene is done.. .. why don't you tell Bob.. .. that you don't want the stunt double anymore. That's all you gotta do.. .. but you yell at me. I yell at you? You yell.. - You yelled at me! You're yelling at me! - You yelled at me! You yelled at me! - You yelled at me! Shut up. - You shut up. Is this his food? Why don't you have some? - I don't want it. Then why'd you ask for it? - I didn't ask for it! Who did then? - Don't ask me! You asked Don. I didn't ask Don to get food! You said are you hungry.. Excuse me.. - Hey Superstar.. .. how'd it go? - Uh.. .. I want the stunt double gone. I just got a raise. Oh fuck.. Oh my God, that was amazing.. Perry you were awesome in that sex scene, dude. The guy is putting his thing.. - Bob, Fire.. Fire the stunt double. I can't use any of it because.. I don't.. I.. I.. they had full penetration. You know? Did they use any of the condoms? - I can't get.. .. I can't get an NC-17, I got the NAACP.. .. already all over me. What was that Perry? Did they use the condoms? Yeah. - They used the condoms.. .. and they use that lotion stuff they.. .. blew on it, it got hot.. .. and then they used those clips.. .. and then he used that strap-on thing.. She did all that stuff they have on.. .. the worldwide internet.. .. she was doing this stuff to him.. .. and it was crazy that guy cause I think.. .. she's an acrobat too. Why? What'd she do? She like lifted her legs behind her head and stuff. Oh wow.. You should've totally been in there.. I should've been totally.. - Making sweet, sweet.. .. love with that pretty naked lady. - ..making sweet sex with.. .. the pretty naked lady. - .. my girl. Yeah. - But I got fucked over. Then in comes, uh, the stunt double who.. .. gave her the salami. And of course, you know, she loved what she got. Well, you're the one who begged for a stunt guy. For the shit in the dumpster.. .. not for all the stunts. - Yeah, but now.. .. he's gonna be the guy in all.. .. the other sex scenes. - So what're you telling me? So now I wanna fire him. I demanded.. Right to Bobcat's face.. .. I says look Bob.. No.. no more stunt doubles when it comes.. .. to the rest of this movie. You're gonna do the stunts? You're gonna do your own stunts? - Yes, yes. He's fired and he's fired for good. Because I'm looking at me as another.. .. Jackie Chan. Anything. I'm gonna do all stunts. I want to explain this again.. .. red bat is the wooden bat. Don't hit Perry, don't hit the money. You'd hurt his.. .. you'd hurt him bad if he got smacked in the head with that.
