Sometimes I feel a little crazy. I have these memories of things ﻿that are unrelated to reality and maybe never even happened ﻿but I know they did happen, as I feel them so intensely. ﻿Here's the infirmary. ﻿Snow in Hebron. ﻿I chose to become a medic. It sounded nice. ﻿The idea of learning a profession ﻿that could serve me later in life. ﻿And also saving lives. ﻿I was very idealistic in that sense. ﻿Just before the end of the course. ﻿one girl told us about her service in the Territories. ﻿how she goes with her helmet, vest and weapon to every incident. ﻿how she treats the wounded, choppers, operations, real action, ﻿"That's where it's happening, that's where you're needed. ﻿"that's where you have to go." I liked that. ﻿I said: If that's the best part of the job. then that's what I want. ﻿I remember going into the commander's room ﻿who was handing out assignments. ﻿I was the last one to go in and I still didn't know ﻿which assignments were left. ﻿And he surprised me. I got Hebron. ﻿And I jumped for joy. ﻿Really? -Yes. ﻿7! 6! 5! ﻿4! 3! 2! 1! ﻿I cried so much when I first got there. ﻿You don't know what you'll encounter... Gunshots... ﻿I can sense the danger and the danger is real. ﻿All you hear, all the time ﻿is "boom" or gunshots. ﻿The first thing I remember is my overlapping week. ﻿We met the medical team that serves there. ﻿We said hello. I introduced myself. ﻿Next thing I remember is hearing over the radio ﻿in the ambulance beside us: "Man down in Noga 9. ﻿"man down in Noga 9." ﻿Before I knew it. I was told that ﻿there was a wounded soldier who needed to be evacuated. ﻿The medic ran first and I ran after him. ﻿When I reached the door, they yelled at me to duck. ﻿I did what everyone else did. which was crawling on the floor. ﻿Then I noticed that there were bullets flying... ﻿in every direction. ﻿When we left the building, heading towards the ambulance. ﻿we had to run and hope that no bullets would hit us. ﻿We drove back to the infirmary at HQ. ﻿The doctor came, shook my hand and said: ﻿"Congratulations, that was your first incident. ﻿"That's how you learn." ﻿Then he ordered pizza for all of us. ﻿There are 5 minors currently on the Bar artery. ﻿They're definitely up to something. ﻿Vertex to Snow White. ﻿They're heading towards the far end of the Bar artery. ﻿Roger. I'm going there on foot. I'll get to them on foot. ﻿It's loads of power. ﻿There's an incident that's about to happen ﻿and it'll happen the way you make it happen. ﻿You hear soldiers panting over the radio, ﻿because you're making them run. ﻿they're running because you said so. ﻿The commander radios in and asks you what to do. ﻿You tell him where to go. "No, on second thought, turn around." ﻿It's loads of power. Loads. ﻿And... you try to do what's right with it. ﻿Vertex to Snow White. ﻿Vertex, they're on your right, running away towards the schools. ﻿Roger. I'm on my way. ﻿Vertex. they're heading, towards Intersection 76. ﻿Vertex to Snow White. ﻿Vertex, did you identify them? ﻿There were some stone throwers and I got them. ﻿So I had to go to HQ. make a statement ﻿and identify them from a lineup. ﻿And it's scary and I stressed out. ﻿All the way there. I started doubting myself. I thought: ﻿"Maybe they didn't throw stones. I can't remember what happened..." ﻿When I got there. I saw them tied up. ﻿blindfolded, real life size. Real, living people. ﻿Then I went in to write my witness' statement. ﻿with my lack of confidence. ﻿So I asked the investigator: ﻿"What if... Let's say... it didn't happen? ﻿"If they don't confess, will you release them?" ﻿He looked at me and said: ﻿"They will confess." ﻿So I said: "But what if they didn't do it?" ﻿He said: "They'll confess." ﻿You think: "I have to be here, I have to do this, but I can't. ﻿"How will they confess? In what way?" ﻿But then you go back to base and have to start your next shift. ﻿You have to. What, you won't do it? ﻿That was the atmosphere: taking the jeep. ﻿doors open in the back, driving fast, ﻿skidding and spinning out. I remember thinking: ﻿"We're in the Wild West. We can do whatever we feel like." ﻿Part of doing what you feel like was, for example. ﻿to stop our jeep next to a group of people. ﻿call them over with our finger, to approach... ﻿This power, that you just motion with your finger ﻿and the person comes. No hesitation. ﻿There was one time when we released a boy in the Strip. ﻿In the evening. That night. ﻿the commander was patrolling in the area in a jeep ﻿and he saw the boy sitting in a corner, at a soldiers' post ﻿and he asked the soldiers: ﻿"What's he doing here? We let him go hours ago." ﻿So they said: "We were just playing with him." ﻿He approached the boy who was crying and hysterical ﻿and... ﻿He was in a very bad state. All beaten up. ﻿The commander returned to the War Room and said: ﻿"Call the commander who's in charge of those soldiers. ﻿"I want a report about this event." ﻿The report arrived at the War Room ﻿and it detailed how the soldiers, who didn't lie about it. ﻿specifically stated ﻿how they beat him up. put out cigarettes on him. etc. ﻿I handed the report to my commander ﻿and he said: ﻿"Call that commander, tell him that with this report ﻿"we'll have the Investigation Unit all over us. ﻿"Tell him to change the report." ﻿I remember that 30-second walk ﻿from his office back to the War Room. ﻿with the report in my hand. ﻿I think it was the only time in my service ﻿that I thought about contacting a journalist. ﻿This is my chance. I’m about to get another report. ﻿I could show him both versions, as proof. ﻿I deliberated whether I should photocopy it ﻿before it gets "buried" away, but I didn't do it. ﻿I called the said commander, and told him: ﻿"You are required to... write up a new report." ﻿He said: "No problem." And we got a new report. ﻿I was thinking about it all day long, the new report said: ﻿"The boy is a pathological liar, he also claimed... ﻿"that the soldiers did this and that to him... ﻿"The boy is a pathological liar, the soldiers ﻿"treated him well, etc." And that was the end of it. ﻿I was struggling to remain humane, at least a little. ﻿In the reality that I was in. it was completely wiped out. ﻿Why didn't I do it? ﻿Because... ﻿it was just a fantasy. There was no chance that... ﻿I really don't know why I didn't do it. ﻿Lions, lions... ﻿The volume is very high in the Territories. ﻿Everyone yells. With one another and... ﻿Like. "Hey. dude." everybody talks like this. ﻿and it's funny that you, as a girl. ﻿take on masculine traits. ﻿You find yourself talking like a man. ﻿you hide feminine characteristics. ﻿For instance, it was very cold in Hebron. ﻿so I'd wear a winter jumpsuit. ﻿which makes you look like a teddy bear. ﻿not like a boy or a girl. ﻿you try to hide your feminine characteristics. ﻿Because everyone knows you're a woman. ﻿that won't change. ﻿but to be "one of the guys", to belong. ﻿I'd only been there for 4 days. ﻿the first time I met my soldiers. ﻿I was really excited, everyone asked me who I was. ﻿a new girl, very interesting. ﻿Then I noticed that they were holding prayer beads ﻿and little Korans. So I said: "Wow. that's nice." ﻿"Where did you get those?" ﻿So they said: "We brought them from Qalqilya." ﻿I was like. "What? But that's looting. It's forbidden." ﻿And they said: "It's okay, it's okay." ﻿A few days later. I met with the regiment commander ﻿and he asked me: "What's your impression of us so far?" ﻿I said: "The regiment is wonderful. ﻿"everyone's great, but I noticed that a certain company ﻿"took some beads and Korans from Qalqilya ﻿"and perhaps you should look into that." ﻿He says: "What? Are you sure?" I say: "Yes." ﻿So he phones the company commander and says: ﻿"The Education NCO is here and she says that she saw ﻿"this and that in your company." ﻿The commander says: "She's a liar!" ﻿I was so shocked. Then he says: ﻿"If it did happen. it will be strictly dealt with." ﻿Ok. ﻿A few days later. I went to visit that company ﻿and its commander saw me. He says: ﻿"So you're the Education NCO who squealed on us?" ﻿And then his soldiers started... ﻿I can't even describe it... They banned me. ﻿They wouldn't let me into their company for 4 months. ﻿If they saw me walk by. they'd spit on the ground. ﻿I really regretted having done that: ﻿From now on. if they're just little things. I'll keep quiet. ﻿Your social status in the regiment is very important. ﻿You're supposed to be the sweet girl that everyone likes. ﻿who who keeps them company and whose hair smells good. ﻿It's a very cushy job. ﻿All you have to do is wash your hair every so often. ﻿I loved the guys, they were great. ﻿I was a real queen there. ﻿I was a blonde, and in our unit... ﻿Blondes get respect! ﻿There was a sick sense of humor. ﻿We were nearby a mosque. ﻿when suddenly we hear from the mosque: ﻿"I've Got the Power!" ﻿It's that song... I don't remember how... A very funny old song. ﻿Instead of "Allah is Great", you hear: "I've Got the Power!" ﻿They just went up to the mosque. ﻿changed the tapes, and that was that. ﻿It was great, it was a joke that... ﻿Whoever did it. and I know who did. ﻿they were awesome! What a brilliant thing to do! ﻿We really enjoyed this adrenaline, the action. ﻿If there was an incident on your shift, you felt lucky. ﻿It felt like... ﻿you were watching a soccer game that you can't see. ﻿You wait for the next big thing to happen. ﻿We'd turn the volume of all the radios to the maximum ﻿and... ﻿"Well? Well?" ﻿Then there's a huge boom that shakes the whole War Room. ﻿mission accomplished, the house is destroyed. ﻿To get the best view point ﻿we'd run to the canteen and climb up on the... ﻿picnic-style tables that they had there. ﻿to see beyond the wall really clearly. ﻿how Beit Hanun was being attacked. ﻿In one of the operations, two terrorists dressed up as women. ﻿Male soldiers couldn't touch women. ﻿They weren't checked and discovered ﻿and then they killed one soldier and severely wounded another. ﻿We were only 4 female officers. ﻿they told us that from now on. ﻿each and every operation, big or small. ﻿will include a female officer. ﻿So that anyone who looks like a woman ﻿dressed in an Arab woman's clothing. ﻿a female officer will check her. ﻿It was fun at first, getting a lot of shooting training, ﻿shooting cans of Coke in sand dunes. ﻿I'd put the cans in my office and if someone annoyed me ﻿I'll tell him he'd end up like the can. ﻿My first operation was on my 20th birthday. ﻿A call came through on the radio: ﻿"Palestinians are running amok onto the streets." ﻿obviously, because their houses were being bombed. ﻿It was the first time I encountered a population ﻿in a real distressed state of fighting, of war. ﻿Your house is being destroyed, so you freak out ﻿and go out with everything you've got. ﻿which is basically nothing, and amok. ﻿I'm in the jeep and all I can hear ﻿is the horrible sound of the stones hitting the jeep. ﻿All you can see are stones. People are mobbing you... ﻿We were wearing helmets and the jeep was armored. ﻿then I was given a club. one of the commanders said: ﻿"Go out there and start hitting. ﻿"You're one of us. take a club and get on with it!" ﻿That's what I remember, a plot of land, rioting. ﻿a baby screaming. I wanted to go pick him up. ﻿it was so instinctive, to hug him. to calm him down. ﻿Then his mother came out and looked at me ﻿with such hatred in her eyes, and at that moment ﻿I realized exactly who I was and how she saw me. ﻿I realized that ﻿I was in deep trouble. ﻿There was no way back. ﻿I thought that I had a solid outlook on life ﻿but here, everything falls apart. ﻿You get used to it. ﻿You can't feel so much all the time. ﻿It's not the time for soul-searching. ﻿From the start. I never told anyone what was happening there. ﻿It seemed impossible. ﻿Things seemed different there. ﻿There were different rules, different conduct. ﻿different atmosphere. ﻿Besides, everybody knew about the major incidents, right? ﻿That a baby girl was killed by a Palestinian sniper. ﻿everyone knows the facts that are reported in the media. ﻿there's nothing new to add. ﻿For me, it took on a different dimension. ﻿There was a baby girl who was wounded ﻿and we couldn't treat her very well. ﻿And I felt that she was on my hands ﻿because I'm the sector commander. ﻿I'm overseeing the incident ﻿and I'm in charge of the wounded. It ﻿was the first incident in which... ﻿I had a fatal casualty. ﻿And it wasn't just a fatal casualty, it was a baby girl ﻿whose picture I saw in the paper the next day. ﻿But it passed. And everyone said: ﻿"Congratulations, that was your first fatal casualty." ﻿And a few minutes later, we had to deal with new thing ﻿You reach a point where they're all the same to you. ﻿There are no exceptions. ﻿At the time, they were all the same to me. ﻿It doesn't matter if someone smiles at me or is nice to me. ﻿﻿I don't see that. ﻿"Why are you coming in here? You don't have an Israeli ID. ﻿"what do you want?" ﻿You're so bitter, it's not bitterness of one day. ﻿It's not depression, it's something that... It's ﻿trying to impose order. ﻿When I heard that Hanny Abramov had been shot. ﻿I felt like a bullet had just hit my heart. ﻿I didn't know what happened to her. ﻿I just heard about it and I was in a total shock. ﻿I went out for my next shift, and of course. ﻿Hanny was in my thoughts. ﻿Every Arab I saw. saw Hanny in my mind. ﻿I felt that every Arab I stopped that day. ﻿I was assigned at a checkpoint that day. ﻿﻿I felt as if HE had done that to her. ﻿During that 12-hour shift. I detained about 80 people. ﻿Arabs. I stood them in a line ﻿and decided they will stay the 12-14 hours of my shift. ﻿in the hot sun. ﻿I, like, decided to punish them. ﻿I made them stand there and do push-ups and all sorts of... ﻿I made them stand in threes, as if they were my soldiers, recruits. ﻿I also started screaming at them and... ﻿for no reason. I started yelling: ﻿"Why did you do that to Hanny? She didn't deserve that! ﻿"Do you know who Hanny is? She's my friend!" ﻿Of course, they had no idea what I was talking about, but... ﻿There wasn't anyone else around. ﻿just my soldiers and they accepted it. ﻿I mean, what I did wasn't out of the ordinary. ﻿My job was to inspect the female population. ﻿Any layers on. coats and such ﻿they had to take it all off, down to their bra and panties. ﻿so I could see. ﻿"Lift up your clothes. I need to feel them." ﻿You push them against the wall and spread their legs from behind. ﻿Check them really well. ﻿At times they had me check more intimate places. ﻿No, no penetration, just with my hand. ﻿Suddenly I heard a scream: The border guard kicked ﻿the hand of the woman I was about to check. ﻿very hard. A knife flew up in the air. ﻿He picked it up and said: "Look, she wanted to kill you ﻿"Go deal with her!" ﻿The soldiers are, like. "Come on. beat her up. ﻿"teach her a lesson, she wanted to kill you. ﻿"she had a knife in her hand." Etc. etc. ﻿I couldn't stand her screaming. Between them and her screaming. ﻿it was too much. So I just yelled: ﻿"Stop screaming!" ﻿I could've taken out on her all my bitterness ﻿for having to be there. ﻿I could have! ﻿But I only took out a fifth of my bitterness. ﻿After all, she wanted to kill me. Slaughter me. ﻿It's not that I caught an innocent bystander. ﻿She wanted to kill me. I could've done... ﻿"He who rises to kill you. kill him first." ﻿I didn't do it. but I felt that rage. ﻿It totally freaked me out. and from that moment on. ﻿I think it really messed me up. ﻿55. what's your location? ﻿Vertex to Snow White. -Roger. ﻿It was an ordinary observing shift. ﻿when suddenly I saw some people standing. ﻿It was clearly going to be a fire-bomb incident. ﻿Then my heart starts pounding. I start to feel the adrenaline. ﻿I started making calls, alerting the forces. ﻿I talked to about 30 people... ﻿And then.. ﻿You wait. ﻿During that time, you're split in two. ﻿On one hand, you're saying: "Come on. do something ﻿"Throw something, do something You're waiting for it. ﻿You've already alerted all the forces in the world. ﻿so if nothing happens... ﻿everyone will laugh at you or will be angry ﻿or in future incidents they may think twice ﻿before responding to your call. You have a status to maintain. ﻿Then they light a fire bomb. ﻿And our snipers opened fire. ﻿Then suddenly this guy radios in frantically and says: ﻿"I've got an Oleander here." ﻿Oleander means a fatal casualty. ﻿That's it. Then I stopped feeling. ﻿My friend came in, I told her to sit down, and I left. ﻿You can't do that, it's an incident. ﻿forces are involved. I'm needed. ﻿I didn't even explain to her what had happened. ﻿I just left. ﻿An hour later they reported on the news ﻿that there was a fatal casualty. I killed a man. ﻿All you can think about is that you killed a man. ﻿Then they said it was a boy. ﻿The unbearable lightness of death, that's what it was. ﻿The death of people I knew who were killed ﻿and the death of the Palestinians who were killed. ﻿I remember this guy who jumped up on the fence ﻿and started yelling hysterically: "Allah is Great. Allah is Great!" ﻿In the early days, we'd shoot to warn. Now, we shot to kill. ﻿I remember the day they killed that guy on the fence. ﻿His body remained hanging on the fence. ﻿And I... I remember I was... ﻿It was so... I didn't know what to do. ﻿I was in the office with my medics. ﻿And my commanding officer came and said: "There's a body. ﻿"Who wants to come see it?" ﻿There was a group of wanted men and one of them was shot dead. ﻿I jumped up and said: "I want to see!" ﻿I remember riding in the ambulance. ﻿I was sitting opposite Uriel and he kept wanting to puke. ﻿also wanted to. but I couldn't tell him that. ﻿otherwise we both would've puked. The body stank so badly. ﻿so we put a blanket over it and wrapped ourselves too. ﻿so as not to smell it. ﻿From time to time, our eyes fell on the body. ﻿which was covered, but it didn't help. ﻿He kept saying that he wanted to puke ﻿and I kept telling him to hang in there. ﻿We took the body to the infirmary ﻿where we were told that.. ﻿before the body is returned to the Palestinian Authority. ﻿we have to clean it so there won't be any blood stains on it. ﻿so they won't see what we did to him. The state he was in. ﻿And that job was assigned to me. ﻿Because he'd suffered a non-fatal head injury ﻿and slowly bled to death. ﻿he lost control over his sphincters. That's what happens. ﻿So... ﻿He urinated and shat on himself. ﻿So we used a water hose to clean him ﻿and he's lying there with his eyes open. ﻿so I close his eyes because Uriel tells me he's scared. ﻿I close his eyes and continue hosing him down ﻿and scraping off the blood from various parts. ﻿And then his eyes opened again. It happens, it's a reflex. ﻿And it's a very scary moment. It's as if he's coming back to life. ﻿People look at me. like: "You did what?! ﻿"You cleaned a corpse?!" ﻿And they're repelled by it. ﻿But I can't let myself be repelled by it. ﻿Why? ﻿Why? Because it's on my hands. ﻿I have to keep using my hands, I can't be repelled by it. ﻿I'm washing dishes in the kitchen. ﻿which is what I did most of the time. ﻿suddenly there's this commotion and I hear the guys coming in ﻿and I understand that they've returned with something. ﻿they're not empty-handed. ﻿I dry my soapy hands and go outside to see what's up. ﻿I see they're back with dead bodies. ﻿of terrorists, on stretchers, that were covered. ﻿They say: "Yep. we've got some terrorists' bodies here." ﻿I'm like: "What"? Cool What...?” ﻿It really deterred me, this unexpected presence of death. ﻿Then they pulled out cameras and took pictures with the bodies. ﻿I thought: "It's wrong to take pictures with dead bodies." ﻿On the other hand, it wasn't terrible enough ﻿to make me call a journalist and say: ﻿"Oh dear, they're taking pictures with dead bodies. ﻿"we need to alert the world..." ﻿I didn't think for a moment that taking pictures ﻿with dead bodies was normal. It's not normal. ﻿But the reality of the Territories isn't normal either. ﻿Everything that happens there isn't normal. ﻿but somehow... it works. ﻿A minus and a minus make a plus. ﻿Abnormal and abnormal work. It fits. ﻿I'm in the shower and my mother shouts: ﻿"They say your Brigade Commander is wounded." ﻿I get out of the ﻿shower. ﻿look at my military cell phone and see 20 unanswered calls. ﻿all from my commander, so I call him. ﻿I barely said a word and he starts screaming: ﻿"Come to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem now! ﻿"I don't care how!" ﻿Total panic, hysteria... And he hung up. ﻿I understood that I had to get there immediately. ﻿I didn't know how or why. ﻿or what do I, an Education Officer, have got to do with it. ﻿I got my dad and we drove to Jerusalem. ﻿I saw all the wounded cut open, ready to be operated on. ﻿I ﻿saw the blood, the injuries. ﻿passing by me. some people I knew too. ﻿They were delegating roles: "You do that, you go there... ﻿"Dana, you'll report ﻿"when the critically wounded become fatal casualties!" ﻿You're in the middle of it. ﻿you get to the scene of the attack a minute after the event. ﻿With all the ambulances, the police cars, you're there. ﻿Evacuating the wounded, anything that needs to be done. ﻿And you see an arm. just lying there on the road... ﻿Then, an insane wave of incidents began. ﻿Every week or two. there was an incident ﻿with fatal casualties. From this brigade, that unit... ﻿All the time, more and more dead. ﻿I made up a "bereavement kit", so I could function quickly. 1.2.3. ﻿What was in the kit? ﻿A list of newspaper cuttings I had to collect. ﻿an operations tactical board, ready to use. ﻿memorial candles, barbwire, to make it more heartbreaking. ﻿You carry on. There's dinner ﻿and tomorrow's tasks and equipment to arrange ﻿and things to finalize and... you don't stop. ﻿In this particular area, we'd patrol ﻿very late at night. I was in an armored jeep. ﻿when suddenly I spot someone. An Arab. ﻿He's looking at me. He sees I am alone in the jeep. ﻿He's trying to catch my gaze and I stare right at him. ﻿And he starts making rude gestures at me. ﻿I looked him straight in the eye. and all I was concerned about ﻿was memorizing his looks and clothes. ﻿I remember it to this day: He wore red shorts. ﻿a white T-shirt, and had medium-length black hair. ﻿I memorized his exact description ﻿and as soon as he saw my guys returning, he fled. ﻿Ran like crazy. ﻿I told my soldiers to dump their paper cups. ﻿because I wanted to go fast. ﻿﻿I was ready at the whee ﻿I drove so fast. When we found him and caught him. ﻿he realized who I was and what was going on. ﻿We took him into one of the alleys and.. ﻿I started screaming at him. ﻿I made him look me in the eyes and confess. ﻿He didn't respond, he just lowered his gaze. ﻿We undressed him down to his underwear. ﻿And we abused him. ﻿The weekend comes along and again I'm alone in the sector. ﻿again we’re on high alert and there's a shooting battle. ﻿and again. there's another dead body. ﻿And what is by now normal procedure, we take the body. ﻿put it near the latrines, and wash it. Then.. ﻿something very funny happens: he has an erection. ﻿A dead body with an erection. ﻿We laugh a little, because it's embarrassing. ﻿And... ﻿It's open grounds, so anyone can come take a peek. ﻿Some female sergeants that I knew arrive from the operations room. ﻿One of them has a camera and... ﻿without even thinking. I tell her: "Come take my picture." ﻿I sit down next to the dead body and... ﻿I have my picture taken. ﻿"Dear Meytal what can we say that you don't already know? ﻿"You know that we love you. ﻿"you know that we will miss you very much. ﻿"So we just want to wish you good luck in civilian life." Turn it around! ﻿Cheers. Meytal ﻿I'm not sure when it was. but at some point ﻿I became very ashamed of that picture. ﻿And... ﻿I didn't tell anyone about it. ﻿that it existed. I forgot about it a little. ﻿But I would like to see it. ﻿To see if I look different. ﻿I want to see if I'm smiling. ﻿Who wants to deal with the evil inside him. ﻿with his alienation towards others? ﻿Who wants to deal with that? ﻿Dealing with these questions is painful. ﻿After being released from the army. ﻿I couldn't sleep at night. ﻿I couldn't share what I was going through with anyone. ﻿﻿I didn't want to either. ﻿I'd go out to a bar at night and drink as much as I could. ﻿I'd get back home in the early hours of the morning ﻿and fall into bed. ﻿I'd wake up after a few hours ﻿and start looking for my next drink. ﻿It went on like that for a very long time. ﻿5. 4. 3... ﻿I, Sergeant Rotem Livne. hereby light this beacon... ﻿"Dedicated to the one and only" ﻿"Welcome to the end of your service!" ﻿You will see. you will see ﻿How good it'll be ﻿Next year ﻿"Oh. how good it'll be (God willing!) next year" ﻿In honor of the glorious State of Israel. ﻿I don't like to talk about it with just anyone. ﻿But I also don't.. ﻿It's what I am, it's a part of me. ﻿it's part of what go through every day. ﻿I don't tell. I don't go into details. ﻿I say: "I killed a boy." ﻿I don't even say "the army". ﻿Do you think about it? ﻿It's hard to think about it. I ﻿used to think about it a lot. ﻿but now I just laugh about it. ﻿As much as one can. ﻿Now it's just a part of me. ﻿I used to go home on leave ﻿and call my friend in the army: ﻿"Sivan, it won't come off!" ﻿"What won't come off. Rotem?" ﻿"﻿I keep trying with soap!" ﻿"What won't come off. Rotem?" ﻿"The blood, off my hands! ﻿"I have blood on my hands. I don't know what to do!" ﻿I don't know if she understood, that I'm not joking. ﻿The blood won't come off and I keep trying. ﻿Who's my sweetie pie? Who's my sweetie pie? ﻿Who is so sweet? Who is so gorgeous? ﻿Gorgeous! ﻿Turn over, that's it. Good for you. ﻿Crawl, my darling, crawl. ﻿Whenever my baby starts yelling hysterically. ﻿which isn't very often, but when it happens. ﻿and when it plays on that nerve, what does that tell me? ﻿It takes me back there. So I'm there. ﻿What happened there? I felt bad? ﻿I did something that's against my principles? ﻿It's a kind of black past ﻿that I would be glad to erase from my life? There! ﻿And then it's not just guilt. ﻿it’s a mirror, an unpleasant one. ﻿and it brings out violence in me. ﻿It brings out violence in me. I become... ﻿And you know. ﻿I think that I'm a pretty good mother. ﻿Except for those moments, when I'm like the devil. ﻿Sivan? ﻿Sivan? ﻿Sivan? ﻿I'm here. -You're here. ﻿Hello, madam. -Hello. ﻿How's it going? -Good, how are you? ﻿Snow in Hebron. ﻿Shall I put them in an envelope for you ﻿How in the hell did I ever think I'd be able to forget about it?
