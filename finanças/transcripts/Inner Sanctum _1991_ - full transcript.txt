[MUSIC PLAYING] JENNY (VOICEOVER): Night after night, it's always the same. I lie here awake, wondering who are you dreaming about, Bax? I know it isn't me. Jesus. I can't go on like this. Maybe I should leave a note so he knows it wasn't an accident. Then at least he'll feel guilty. Ugh. Feels like my insides are going to explode. I thought this was supposed to be painless. Oh my god. Baxter. [GROANING] JENNY (VOICEOVER): Keep moving. I must keep moving. It's a million miles away. I'll never make it. Wake up. Jenny? Are you all right? [MUSIC PLAYING] Bax? Bax? Bax? I didn't know you were up. You're not going to work already, are you? Yeah. I have an early appointment in the valley. Who with? It's just a little printing shop. No, I mean who are you going with? Anna Rawlins. She could handle it by herself, but you know old man Wallace, right? Have to stick with the trainees for the full three months. So you've told me. Yeah. JENNIFER: Bax. How long are you and Anna going to be working together? For Christ's sakes, Jen. I just-- I know what you just! Please don't yell at me. Have I ever done anything to make you think I was fooling around? Have I? -No. I mean, when the hell would I have the time, Jen? When I am not at work, I'm taking care of you! Please, let's not fight! Sorry I said anything. If you don't trust me, you ought to divorce me. International All Risk. This is Maureen speaking. How can I help you? Would you please hold? Is he in? On the phone. Well, I'll tell you. Of the four nurses you've described, Ms. Foster sounds about right for us. I'd like her to start tomorrow if she could. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Well, on such short notice-- Well, she doesn't have to start tomorrow. But the sooner the better, all right? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Let me check with her and call you back. All right. Would you-- would you do that, please? And, uh, look. I'm gonna be out of the office most of the day, uh, but you can leave a message with my secretary. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Will do, Mr. Reed. Goodbye. Thank you. Jennifer called. She wanted me to remind you that she's got a 2:00 doctor's appointment. Convenient. Well, you're gonna have to handle that print shop all by yourself. That's OK. Just give me the file. It's on my desk somewhere. Cut it out. How would you like a sexual harassment charge? How would you like to lock the door? How would you a knee in the nuts? [LAUGH] Anna. Anna, I love you. I love you too. I just wish I didn't. It's OK. Don't make me more ashamed than I already am. By next week, if everything goes as I planned-- -It's over, Bax. -No. No, no, no. It isn't. I won't let it be, Anna. You're the only thing that matters to me. You're the only thing-- Let me-- --that keeps me going. Let me go. Tell me that you don't love me, and I'll let you go. [DOOR RATTLING] Damn it. I don't love you. I don't love you. Oh yeah. I don't love you. I ought to make you crawl. Would you please help me with my robe? Sweetheart. You have to do that on my account. I'm your husband. Not now, Bax. Not now, not ever. I've been sick, for gods' sakes. Well, don't go blaming this on that goddamn accident of yours. That was a month ago. This crap has been going on for three months. [CRYING] Man, I feel like crying too. [SOBBING] JENNY (VOICEOVER): Why did the doctors say there was nothing wrong with my legs? Because it's true. It's all in my head. God, Bax. Please don't leave me. REPORT (ON TV): In sports, the International Basketball League-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah! Bax! Bax! Bax? [MUFFLED TV] Bax? [TV CHATTER] [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] Yeah? Oh. Excuse me. Um. Mr. Reed? Oh, yeah. You must be Mrs. Comstock. -No, uh, Foster. -Oh. Ms. Foster. I, uh-- I went back to my maiden name. May I come in? Yeah, sure. Looks like you had a rough night. You got any more bags? Yeah. I got one more. I'll go get it. -Oh, I'll get it. Later. So uh, where's my patient? She's upstairs in her room. LYNN: You know, she, um-- she might be a lot better off down here in case there was a fire. You know, I've been through that with her, Mrs-- Ms. Foster. If you can get her to change to one of the rooms downstairs, well, more power to you. You don't care very much for your wife, do you, Mr. Reed? That's all I've been doing, lady. Now it's your turn. Well, that's what I'm here for. Ain't it? Mrs. Reed? Hi. I'm Lynn Foster. Your nurse. May I come in? Yes. Come in. It, uh, didn't take me as long to get here as I thought, so I'm early. Your house is really nice. It's beautiful. Thank you. These old houses, they're-- they got a whole lot of character, don't you think? Yes. I do. Ms. Foster. Why don't you get yourself squared away, huh? Jenny doesn't need any help right now, do you? Do you, Jenny? No. LYNN: Uh, you sure? -Mhmm. Let me get those, all right? You got the room right next to hers. Uh, nice meeting you. Toilet's right out in the hall. I'm making some breakfast. You want some? LYNN: Uh, no, no. [HONKING] Hi. Anna. What are you doing here? I couldn't wait 'til Monday to tell you. Tell me what? You know that little print shop? Yeah. Yeah. It turned into a chain. What? Faster Prints got 32 locations, including Colorado, Nevada, and Wyoming, and they just picked up California. And guess what? We've got the medical coverage for the whole works. You're joking. No. Isn't that the best? All right. Who's that? Anna Rawlins. She works with Baxter. She's pretty, huh? Well, first thing, we ought to think about moving you downstairs. I've had enough changes in my life lately, thank you. Yeah? Then I suggest you give some serious thought to installing an elevator. So do you think you could give me next week off since I practically earned my keep for the whole month? -Look. I got a better idea. You know the convention starts next Wednesday, runs through the weekend? Anna, come with me. Look at me. You know I can't. Why not? You'd get your own room, if you're worried about a scandal. Hm. Sweetheart. Anna. I know you wanna come with me. Tell you what. You come to the hotel on Wednesday night. We'll just have dinner. If you feel funny, you can always go home. How about it? I promised myself I'd find a single guy and forget all about you. [SCREAM] Bax. When someone's in love, it's supposed to feel good. Mr. Reed. Come quick. What the? What happened? What does it look like? -Should we move her? -Yeah. She'll be all right. BAX: I got her. You can't take your eyes off her for a second. No cuts. Oh. She got a pretty big bump, though. Might not be a bad idea to get a couple x-rays. Oh, come on. She's all right. She'd never really hurt herself. Do you think she did this deliberately? That's exactly what I think. Darling. The next time you try and kill yourself, you better succeed. Otherwise, nobody will take you seriously. What's the matter with you? She's the matter with me. This was not her fault. It was me. I forgot to put the brake on her wheel. Next time you want to get tough with someone, get tough with me. You all right? Hm? BAX (VOICEOVER): Sympathy That's all she's after. But she won't get any from me. ANNA (VOICEOVER): She'd be better off dead, don't you think, honey? BAX (VOICEOVER): No question about it. You want to know something? She thinks I pushed her down the stairs. ANNA (VOICEOVER): Really? BAX (VOICEOVER): Yeah. Never came out and said it, but I could tell she was thinking it. That bottle of sleeping pills she took had nothing to do with it. Can you beat that? I'd take the heat for everything. ANNA (VOICEOVER): Poor baby. BAX (VOICEOVER): If she could, she'd keep me in this house and never let me out. Makes me feel guilty every time I walk out the door. ANNA (VOICEOVER): Now you don't have to go out. Look. [MUMBLING] BAX (VOICEOVER): Why don't I just put her out of her misery? [MUMBLING] [WHIMPERING] [MUFFLED SCREAM] [MUFFLED SCREAM] Feeling better? If you really want to kill yourself, I'll show you how. Lynn. Thank you for taking the blame. LYNN: Any time. You get some rest, OK? -OK. It's been hell for you, hasn't it? Well, I think she'll live. So how did you like your first day on the job? Little slow. Told you on the phone it wouldn't be easy. I got no complaints. Oh, I'm sorry. Just trying to figure out where I've seen you before. That's all right. -I don't might being stared at. -Anna, look. Uh, why don't I walk you out to your car? All right. It was nice to meet you. -Yeah. [KNOCKING] [DOOR OPENING] Excuse me. You might try knocking next time. I did. You didn't answer. Well, uh, next time I don't answer, stay out. You know, you-- you shouldn't walk around like that in front of a guy who's been living in a dry state. [SCOFF] So uh, what was it you wanted to talk to me about. Nothing. I just wanted to say good night. Did you say good night to your wife? You know, it's interesting. Yesterday, once the doctor finally blew the lid off Jen's paralysis bullshit-- You know, it just so happens that a mental condition is just as real as a physical one. Yeah, whatever. I can only tell you this. Yesterday, I wanted to kill my wife, and I pictured myself reaching out and grabbing her by the throat. I knew then I had two choices. Kill her, or call you. I'm not sure I made the right choice. Sleep tight. Oh, can I have one of those? And your wife would love a cup of tea. Thank you, Mr. Reed. -Did you put her to bed? -Ah-huh. Wanna go tuck her in? That's your job now. Yeah? BAX: Yeah. I was wondering what my job was exactly. What's that supposed to mean, exactly? You do like to plot, don't you, Mr. Reed? Look. I came out here to be by myself. If you have something to say to me, I wish you'd say it and take off. All right. I know that you know who I am. You let that slip right off. So? So I know you hate your wife enough to kill her. What are you doing? Are you making me a proposition? Hm? I thought that's what you were doing, in your own sluggish way. Have a nice one. MAN: You can't afford to piss Reed off. You're the top sales person this month. I know it's here someplace. The only thing I've sold in the last two months was to my folks. -Relax. We're not doing anything wrong. We're going through a man's personal property. The janitor didn't seem to mind when he opened the door for us. Yeah, well, he'd open a vault for you, that guy. He's crazy about you. Then again, who isn't? Jeff. No wonder nobody's selling anything. We were-- I was-- do you remember the other day, a snapshot fell out of a file? -No. I knocked a file off the top of your desk. Yes, I remember that. I just don't remember any photograph. And in the future, I'd like you to ask before you make yourself at home in here. Have you got that, Jeff Seigel? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Stick around a minute, Seigel. You know, real stupid to bite the hand that feeds you. I don't understand. Not that I blame you. She's got a sweet little ass on her, huh? However, there's lots of sweet little ass out there that don't work at International All Risk, if you know what I mean. I don't think she knows I exist, sir. Yeah. Maybe it's just as well, huh. Tell you what. Why don't we write you some business so the old man don't take my head off, huh? Got anything lined up today, Jeffery? Maybe, in Van Nuys. Hm. Well, let's do it. LYNN: Fresh air and sun. Just what the doctor ordered. There we go. Lynn, I mean it. I can't be out like this. What are you worried about? There's nobody here. -I feel naked. -Yeah. Feels good, don't it? I've never been so embarrassed in all my life. Besides, the sun can give you cancer. Oh, Jennifer, you are so paranoid. I read that Cary Grant spent half his life basking in the sun, and he lived 'til he was 90. Of course. You must be right. It slipped my mind. You're a nurse. Did the doctor give you any leg exercises? No. There are no exercises I can do for my legs, Lynn. I'm paralyzed. Would you please just take me back into the house? Jennifer. You know why you can't walk? Your ass is too tight. -You married, Lynn? -I was. What happened? He died. I'm sorry. Don't be. He was a creep. A rich one, but definitely a creep. Lynn. There's someone at that window. What? Where? JENNIFER: He's gone now. -So? Let him look. But the house is vacant. It's been vacant for over months. So somebody moved in. People gotta live somewhere. Yeah. I guess you're right. Mellow out, would you, Jennifer? Lynn. I just saw him again. Some guy, you said? I think he had a camera. -Yeah. Probably some guy. Probably some pervert. [TAPPING] [DOOR CLICK] Little late for a neighborly visit, isn't it? I heard the pounding. I just wanted to know what was going on. Just how clever are you, Mr. Reed? I get by. Yeah? Well, uh, I'm pretty clever myself. Lynn? Woke you up too, huh? -He's been hanging drapes. -Yeah. Real interior decorator. It's an odd time of night to be hanging drapes, don't you think? Hm. Maybe he's putting up wallpaper now. How long you been watching? Did you see Bax? Yeah. I saw. He was there for at least 20 minutes. What do you think he could be up to? Why don't we ask him tomorrow? Right now, I want you in bed and asleep. Sleep. Can't sleep. Too wired. I got just the thing for you. Where are you going? LYNN: Here we go. Good girl. I want to find you sitting in your chair tomorrow morning. Right? Promise? Good night, honey. Night. LYNN: Night. [HEAVY BREATHING] Ah! [THUNDER BOOMING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Bax. [MUSIC PLAYING] Bax. [GROANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [WHIMPERING] [WHIMPERING] [COUGHING] [COUGHING] [GASPING] Jennifer. [COUGHING] Trying to kill me. Jennifer. He tried to ki-- kill me. What's going on? Jesus. [COUGHING] She's all right. Somebody left the has on. He try-- tried to kill me. [COUGH] What are you, fucking nuts? What? Are you out of your mind? BAX: What? -Shit. Don't give me that innocent look. I'm not buying it. -What? You think that I-- Oh, no. Not you. It was the gas fairy. Well, I didn't do it. I swear it. We both just heard her say you did. She said he did it. Who the hell was she talking about if it wasn't you? How the fuck do I know? She's nuts. Look. I've been at work all day long. You don't believe me? Call them. Go on. Call them. Lynn. Look, if I was gonna kill her, she'd be dead. -Well, unless-- -What? You don't-- you don't think she meant the guy next door, do you? The guy next-- and what fucking sense does that make? She doesn't even know the guy next door. Yeah. But you do. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, I'm out of here. Little early, aren't you? Uh, working again with Seigel this morning. Guy's got diddly on his books this month. Last day to work with him. Oh yeah. You got that convention, don't you? Yep. How long you gonna be gone? Be back Sunday night. -Taking Anna Rawlins with you? -Yeah. That's really none of your business. Yeah? Well, I'll tell you what is my business. Making sure I'm not getting set up. Man, go I was right. You are getting paranoid. No. No, not paranoid. Just cautious. You see, the way I got it figured, your wife has got this big, fat life insurance policy, seeing as you're in the biz. Only, you can't collect on suicide. However, if she manages to get herself murdered, then that's a different story, ain't it? Have a lovely day. Jennifer, we can't call the police. Why not? Because we got no proof, that's why. I mean, nobody actually saw him in the house, including you. No offense, but, uh, I don't think some guy's gonna just move into the neighborhood just to kill you. You don't believe me. No, no. I'm not saying that. It's just, well, maybe somebody hired him. I don't understand. LYNN (ON SPEAKER): Come on, Jennifer. Do you have any money? JENNIFER (ON SPEAKER): Well, my father died a couple months ago. When they settle the estate, I'll probably have $1 million coming. LYNN (ON RADIO): A mil? JENNIFER (ON SPEAKER): That's insane. You don't know what you're talking about. LYNN (ON RADIO): Jennifer. It makes a lot more sense that Baxter would wanna kill you than some stranger off the street. JENNIFER (ON RADIO): You don't understand. Baxter loves me. LYNN (ON RADIO): Really? Who you trying to convince? Me or yourself? What? You're kidding. Fucking bitch just won the lottery. Well, that's fantastic. Congratulations Well, I'm sure you must. Well, I couldn't be happier for you. I-- yeah. You must be-- Listen, Mrs. Grimaldi. I gotta go. Well, goodbye. Congratulations. Never won anything in my life. It's always the assholes that win. You ever notice that? OK. Let's get outta here. LYNN: Jennifer. Dig this. Pluto is in conjunction with Mars, and since your moon's in Scorpio, you got no worries, kid. Jennifer. You could show a little more enthusiasm. OK. How about some leg exercises? Jenny, the sooner you get better, the sooner you get rid of me. [GUNSHOT] [GASP] Sh. -Was that a shot? -Yeah. From that weirdo next door. Guess he's all through being subtle. MAN: Was anybody hurt? I was cleaning my gun. I-- I'm-- I'm sorry. That's the first time this ever happened to me. Are-- are either of you hurt? Just scared shitless, that's all. I'm Ralph Driscoll, uh, your new neighbor. Um, hell of a way to introduce myself, huh? I'm Lynn Foster. This is Jennifer Reed. I met your husband last night. I, um-- I'm really sorry about this. You know, you think you're being so careful, and-- Why were you taking pictures of us yesterday, Mr. Driscoll? Oh, I feel like a real jerk now. I'm afraid you caught me in an embarrassing moment. You're not a photographer, then. Oh, no, ma'am. Strictly amateur. JENNIFER: What do you do? I, uh, repair old jukeboxes and things like that. I've got a little place on Melrose. Memories and More. You, uh, ought to drop by sometime. Hm. I just might. Could you use a, uh, drink or something, uh, Mr. Driscoll. Please. Call me Ralph. And I don't want to impose any more than I already have. Thank you. -No, no. Don't be silly. Would you like some tea? -Uh, that would be fine. -I'll get it. No, no, no. I want to. I need to start doing things for myself, don't I? WOMAN (ON PHONE): What city? Los Angeles. Memories and More, please. On Melrose. WOMAN (ON PHONE): 555-5243. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Memories and more. May I speak with Ralph Driscoll, please. WOMAN (ON PHONE): He's not in right now. Would you like to leave a message? But he does work there. WOMAN (ON PHONE): He's the owner. Would you like to leave a message? No. No, thank you. JENNIFER (VOICEOVER): They know each other. Why would they pretend not to, unless-- unless they're in some sort of conspiracy together. [FOOTSTEPS] Ready for seconds? Guess not. Are you feeling all right? -I'm all right. -Look, Jen. If, uh-- -Lynn. I'd really rather be alone right now. -I'm just trying to help. -Are you? Jennifer. You gotta understand. When you try to convince us that someone almost killed you, it ain't easy to swallow. I mean, you-- you already tried to off yourself twice. Once. Just once. Oh? What was that, uh-- that little tumble down the stairs the first day I was here? I was trying to bruise myself on the rail. Why? Because I was hoping to get you fired for leaving me alone, and the chair slipped out from under me and I lost my balance. And now you're trying to fire me again, when I'm the only one around here who don't think you're a total nut case. Would you please leave me alone? Baby. You already are alone. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCK] Jeez. You scared the hell out of me. What are you doing here? I just wanna make sure everything's OK. Does she suspect anything? -No. Everything's cool. NEAL: All right. Then I'll see you back at the house. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Relax. Let me get you a drink, all right? Wait a minute, Lynn. I mean, what if Baxter comes in? And where's the invalid, anyway? LYNN: Jess. I told you he's not gonna be home until late, and she's out for the night. I'm cool. -Lynn. I don't thin this is cool. She got a good look at me yesterday. If someone sees me coming out of this house, everything's blown. OK. Wanna split? Split. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] ANNA (ON PHONE): Hello? Anna, it's Jeff. Listen, I think I found that file you're looking for. Wonder what Reed's doing with it. ANNA (ON PHONE): What do you mean? It belongs in claims. The woman in the photograph is Lynn Comstock. She used to be married to a guy named Howard Comstock. ANNA (ON PHONE): What's her story? Guy named Howard Comstock hired Lynn Foster to take care of his wife. The wife passes away, Comstock marries a nurse, and in less than a year, he's dead too? Looks like this nurse is a pretty deadly dish. Anyway, the police figured that she bumped the old man off for a half a million dollars in life insurance, but they couldn't make a case. So now All Risk is protesting the claim, and they got a PI on her tail trying to dig something up on her. [GAGGING] Bax? Is that you? Yes. I need to talk to you. Not now, Jen. Yes, now. Before Lynn comes back. Back? Where the hell is she? I don't know. She's not supposed to leave you alone. Stupid. How long has she been gone? I don't know. An hour. Maybe more. Bax. I think she wants to kill me. Isn't everyone? I'm serious, Baxter. So am I. She knows that man next door. Yeah, sure. He was here tonight at the house. They were making love. What are you talking about? I saw them. They were here? What? A-- and they just went at it right here in the middle of the room for your amusement. She thought I was asleep, but I wasn't, because I didn't take the sedative she gave me. She thought I did, but I didn't. We-- we're talking about Ralph Driscoll now, right? The jukebox guy from next door. Yes! But his name isn't Ralph Driscoll. Or at least it isn't Ralph, because I-- I heard her call him Neil. Maybe his last name is Driscoll, I don't know. But she called him Neil. What else did you hear? I he-- heard him ask her if I suspected anything, and she said that I didn't. And then they went outside. Jen. You're not making this up? No. Why would I? Oh, Bax. I'm so scared. Tell you what. Jen, I'll talk with Lynn when she gets back. I'll straighten all this out. In the meantime, we're gonna have to get you back to bed. But you'll stay with me tonight, won't you, Bax? Sure. I couldn't stand being alone another night. Don't worry, honey. You won't have to. Neal Semple. Hey! Lovely evening, isn't it? Hold it. Where the hell have you been, huh? I've been out for a walk. What's it to you? It means plenty to me. You were hired to take care of my wife. You got that? What if she'd fallen and injured herself while you were out cruising around the neighborhood? Your sudden concern for your wife is rather surprising, especially since you were planning to kill her yourself. What? What do you mean kill her? Oh, cut the crap, would you? I got you all figured out. While you're supposed to be out of town with Anna, you sneak back here, kill Jennifer, and I take the wrap. What the hell are you talking about? I am talking about $1 million in an estate, plus whatever you get in her life insurance policy. You know, I'm thirsty. You thirsty? Come on. Join me. I, uh-- I hate to upset your apple cart, but I don't like being taken for a chump. Who's Neal Semple? Neal Semple. He's a private investigator, hired by your company to spy on me. I'm really surprised you didn't know that. Well, that's not my department. You know, I'm as tired of him as you are of your wife. Wouldn't it be nice-- I mean, wouldn't it be nice, if we could put your problem and my problem together and have no problem? I'm listening. What's going on, Maureen? The police are waiting to see you. The police? Did they say why? Didn't you hear? Jeff Seigel was killed in his office last night. Killed? Baxter Reed? That's right. I'm Lieutenant Wanamaker. This is Lieutenant Levy. Uh, we're here, Mr. Reed, because-- I know. I just heard. What happened? That's what we'd like to find out. Well, I'd be glad to help out any way I can. We might have more privacy in the conference room. Maureen. Hold all my calls. Yes, Mr. Reed. Now, we understand, Mr. Reed, that you were with Jeff Seigel. Yesterday. Yeah, that's right. Part of the evening as well. Cigarette? No thanks. Well, how did he seem to you, Mr. Reed? How do you mean? I mean, was he happy? Sad? Upset? Did he seem troubled about anything? Well, he hadn't written a lot of business lately. He was worried about that. What, do you, um, think he killed himself? Well, look around you, Mr. Reed. You got windows in every room. There's one in his office. Why would he run into your office and run out your window? Tell me. What time did you guys finish up last night? Gee. I don't remember exactly. It was, a little after 7:00, maybe. Somewhere around there. Ah huh. What was he doing in here so late? Well, that's a good question. I-- I'd like to know how he got in, since I usually lock my door. Well, he broke in. Or somebody did. Tell me, you keep any valuables in your office, Mr. Reed? Anything someone might wanna get their hands on? No. Absolutely nothing. And you have absolutely no idea what he was doing up here so late. I sure as hell don't, inspector. Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Reed. We'll, uh, let you know. No problem. Uh, sorry I couldn't have been more help to you gentlemen. You helped. We'll catch you later. JENNIFER (VOICEOVER): It's only in my mind. It's only in my mind. It's true. I know it's true. [HEAVY BREATHING] I guess I don't know it's true, or my god damn leg would move, wouldn't it? We gotta talk. Baxter. He pushed you down those stairs, and you know it. Jennifer. He wants you dead. I swear it. You heard about Jeff? Yeah. What happened to him, Bax? I don't know. Police think it may have been a suicide. Maybe he just fell. I-- I really don't know. Or maybe he was pushed. What? You think somebody killed him? -Yes. Well, you could be right. Somebody jimmied my door. I just assumed that it was Seigel. It could have been somebody else. A robber. Yeah. Siegel walks in on them. They struggle. That makes sense. No. Jeff broke in. How do you know? He was looking for the file on Lynn. Why? Because I asked him to. Why don't you go home, Anna? You're not doing yourself any good here. Did you hire Lynn to murder Jennifer? Was that the plan, Bax? Did I? Is that what you think? [SCOFF] Well, that is the craziest thing I've ever heard. What the hell's the matter with you? Did you, Bax? Of course not. But you knew who Lynn was. Of course I did. I had the file on her. How could you let someone like that in your home? I needed a nurse. She's a nurse. It's as simple as that. She's a murder suspect. Not according to the police. Now, Seigel told you that, didn't he? Yes, but All Risk thinks that-- Mm-mm. All Risk is only worried about money. They don't care whether this woman is guilty or not. Goodbye, Bax. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Of course I'm nervous, Lynn. What do you think? No. Just to be in the block. We don't dare go any further than that. Look. Soon as you're around the corner, stop. I'll be right behind you. Then we'll go back like you planned. Yeah, I know. Just hold on to your nerve a little while longer. Yeah, I love you too, babe. Hang tough. [MUSIC PLAYING] JENNIFER: You're a filthy liar! A filthy god damn liar and I won't have you in this house another minute, do you hear me? Get out! No! I don't wanna live with you. Get out of my room! No! Get out! Get out, get out! Welcome home. What the hell was that? I tried to tell her you wanted to murder her. She wouldn't believe me. She got so mad, she fired me. As planned. Uh, listen. Why don't you go comfort her? I'll go pack my bags. -Yeah. Jennifer. What's going on? What was all that screaming about? What is it? Oh, Bax. That terribly woman. She hurt you? Please. Please help me. Are you hurt? Settle down, now. Settle down. Everything's gonna be all right. I'm so sorry, Bax. I'm so sorry. I know I've spoiled everything. The convention. I know you've been looking forward to it so much. Sh. Easy now. Sh. -Bax. I just couldn't take it anymore. -It's all right. You're not gonna have to anymore. Darling, it's all right. She told me. She told me. You gave her the boot, didn't you? Oh, sweetheart. Oh, darling. Look. It's gonna be all right. I told her to get the hell out of here tonight. You're never gonna have to see her again. You hear me? Never. I have spoiled everything, Bax. She just-- You have spoiled nothing. Forget that convention. Forget it. You're not angry at me? No, no. Not at all, sweet heart. As a matter of fact, I didn't like her that much either. -Oh, Bax. -What? And I thought-- What? Never mind. Never mind what I thought. Everything's gonna be different from now on. You'll see. Pretty soon, I'll be able to take care of myself. And Bax, I'm gonna be able to walk again. Sure you are. I mean it. I've been exercising every day. That's terrific. Things'll be different from now on. You'll see. I, uh, thought you could use one of these. I think you better have them both. You look like you need them more than me. Yeah. Well, things haven't gone exactly the way I planned. Come on. They've gone better than you planned. I got Jennifer to set the stage. What more do you want? I want it to be over. You better pull yourself together or you're gonna blow this whole thing apart. What if Semple doesn't follow you? Jesus, Baxter. How many times do I have to tell you? He has to follow me. That's what he gets paid for. Look. I bet half of my share of Jennifer's estate that he was packed and ready to leave 10 seconds after she fired my ass. And believe me, he heard her. So did half of Los Angeles. All you gotta do is wait for him to leave and then do your thing. Just make it look like an accident. Shouldn't be too hard. After all, she's got a history of trying to kill herself. Your girlfriend can vouch for that. After all, she was a witness. Good luck. On Do you have any idea how long I've waited for this moment? [GASP] [KNOCKING] Jennifer. Open the door. [RATTLING] Jennifer Open the fucking door! Open it! Jennifer. Jennifer, I don't wanna hurt you. Darling. Please open the door. Jennifer. Open the fucking door! Open it! Open the fucking door! No! [SCREAMING] No! No! No! [SCREAMING] No! No! No, Baxter! Baxter! No! No! No! Help me! Help me! No! No! Baxter! No! No! Bax! Bax! No! Say goodbye, Jennifer! No! Baxter! No! What's the matter, huh? Don't you like it? Don't you? You lied to me! You set me up! You set me up! Who are you? You set me up. [SHOUTING] You're gonna die, you bitch! [SHOUTING] [INAUDIBLE] You're gonna die! You'll die like my wife did! -Baxter! Hey, Jennifer. It's over. I thought he loved me. It's over. [SOB] [MUSIC PLAYING]
