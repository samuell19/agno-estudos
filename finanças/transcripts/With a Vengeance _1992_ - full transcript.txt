Ricky, turn that off! Ricky, did you hear me? -How's the homework? -I'm doing it. -Didn't you see her at the bus stop? -No. Can't I do anything? -Where's your brother? -How should I know? -Didn't you hear me calling you? -No. Did you see Valerie at the bus stop? -I don't know why she's so late. -Maybe she had practice. You want soup? Emmy? Hi, it's Helene. Is Valerie there? Maybe she stopped somewhere on the way. No. I don't remember. Did you see her before you left? No. The boys don't know. She stopped somewhere on the way home. Maybe she told me she'd be late. I just don't remember. I'll tell her. "Gena King is honest, reliable, clean, an outstanding cook." "She keeps to herself, but she's been an important part of our family." "Evan and Erica will miss her terribly." What does that mean, she "keeps to herself"? How am I supposed to interview you if you don't say anything? I'm sorry. -Will you talk to my son? -Yes. Philip's had a tough time. The move out here has made it even tougher. I go out of town on short notice. The Justice Department sends me all over. It won't be a problem. You went to high school in Georgia? You grew up there? Georgia, Maryland, Kentucky... My father's army. -Didn't go to college? -No. We were being transferred and it would've been hard, 'cause I'd have needed out of state tuition. I wanted to be on my own. -Didn't quite work out that way. -Yes, it did. I like what I'm doing. -Where are they now? -Who? -Your family? -Arizona. He's a captain. Spend much time there? It's cheap to fly there. Some. But my mom's in a choir that goes on the road a lot. Mrs. Kalan said you never got a phone call. -I'm a good nanny, Mr. Barcetti. -'Cetti. Like in chicken soup. -Or cioppino. -Right. -I can get you more references. -It isn't necessary. They don't get much better than these. You'll live up to them. I said lobster. We got lobster. -We got tossed salad, baked potato. -I'm home! Philip, move your butt! -How was your day? -Dumb. Say hello to Gena. I just hired her. -Speak, boy, speak. -Hello. Hi. I forgot to tell them to leave off the onions. Better set the table. -He talks a lot, doesn't he? -He's bossy as hell, too. You better watch out! -What are you doing? -We've got the dishes. You do. -I could use the help. -I don't like to do cleaning. -What do you like to do? -I was doing it. -You need the exercise. -No, I don't. Yes, you do. -Give me a break, okay? -Great. -Can I go? -No. -We'll wash them. -You got a dishwasher. -I don't use it. -Why do you bug me? You're not having any fun. -Think I have fun washing dishes? -With me yes. -Bull. I don't even like you. -Yes you do. -Who said? -I can tell. -Where's your mom? -This is sure fun. She's in rehab back east. She did all kinds of stuff. -That's how come they got divorced. -I'm sorry. I'm not. She would have died if she didn't go. -Is she gonna be okay? -She's not much anyway. Philip, get the hell in here! Your room's a sty! Don't tell him. He tried real hard with her. I won't. -Hi. Are there any other exits? -Just the kindergarten bungalow. -We were at the library. -They let you come back late? They don't let us do anything. How come you look so scared? -I wasn't scared. - You should have seen your face. Thank you. That's very nice. I'm glad she's enjoying it. I do what I can. It's nice to be appreciated. It does me good too. It's quiet around here with just the two of us. Thanks again. A little confidence and a good time. That's what it's all about. See you at the next game. Goodnight. -Frank? How was practice? -Fine. You know we're supposed to go to the Petersons later. I completely forgot. Can we beg off tonight, Myra? -I'm just not in the mood. -You want to watch a movie? -Sure. -What do you want to see? You pick. I'll bring the wine. Are you okay? I heard you. You weren't yelling. It was like a whimper or something. -I'm sorry. -You want to come in my room? -I've got a sleeping bag. -No. -Okay. 'Night. -Goodnight. -Hey, Dad. -Hey, yourself. Did you miss me? -Were you gone? -Very funny. -Come here. How'd it go? -She's okay. All right. Get in there. Gena? Talk to me. I'm thorough. I followed up on a couple of things. There are two army bases in Arizona. No Captain King at Fort Huachuca's Quartermaster Corps. No travelling choir. Spenser High School, Fort Benning... No Gena King! No out of state tuition. It's silly to make up things when your references are so good. I'm really sorry because you're doing a terrific job here. You've managed to reach Philip. I'm grateful for that. Explanations? I wouldn't think it was easy for you to lie. It's not exactly a lie. You did go to Spenser High School. Different name? What? Talk to me. Please. Talk to me! I don't know where I went to high school. I don't know if I went to high school. I don't know where my family is. I don't know if I have a family. I don't even know who I am. Cold? -Do you have anything warmer? -I'm fine. So, how does somebody turn up in a San Francisco shelter? One day I wasn't there and the next day I was. Somebody asked me my name. I didn't have an answer. -How do you know it was Gena King? -I don't. I made it up. I thought of Billie Jean King. I guess I like tennis. And Navratilova was a mouthful? -How old were you? -It was four years ago. They figured I was around twenty. Police. Doctors. Nobody recognized you? A girl named Lauren who lived on the street brought me. She took off. -You mean she just dumped you? -Said I've been with her too much. -She never knew who you were? -She said I'd never spoken. -She'd never heard my voice. -And you don't remember her? All I remember is waking up there. I was freezing, dirty and crying. I'm sorry. It's okay if you don't want me to stay. If I call the San Francisco police they're gonna tell me you made this shelter thing up too? No. How will you find out who you are? I don't know. I'm trying to do a good job for you. I like Philip. And I like my work here, Mr. Barcetti... Mike... And I don't know why you should trust me. I don't know why you should trust me, Mike. What would be the point in my letting you go? I'd made a mistake. I hate to admit anything. Finish your tea. Who spilled the popcorn? Clean up this mess. Turn off the video game and get in here. Ricky, did you hear me? I said, "Get in here." -Who's Ricky? -What? -I said: "Who's Ricky?" -What do you mean? That's what you called me. I'm Philip. -I know who you are. -I guess you made a mistake. -Just Ricky? -You said: "Ricky, get in here!" Are you okay? I am gonna clean up the popcorn. Thank you. -What happened? -Gena cut herself. Let me look. -Make it stop. -It's stopped. Put pressure on it. Now look what you made me do. ... of just over 6 years ago when this house was the scene of a murder. Turn that off. I hate to hear that stuff just before I fall asleep. -I'm sorry. Did I wake you? -No. I was thirsty. -What's wrong? -Nothing. -What's the aspirin for? -Just a headache. -How bad? -On a scale of 1 to 10, it's a 12. Hasn't anybody ever tried to help you? -You ever go to see a shrink? -Yeah. In the beginning. When they first found me the police sent me to a hospital. They said that I could have been sick or maybe drugs affected my brain. -And you don't remember anything? -A little. Like what? -You ask a lot of questions. -I'm a lawyer. -Like what? -I keep a file. I make notes. Show me. Gena, when are you going to trust somebody? What's the worst that could happen? -Maybe I did something horrible. -I don't think so. This is it? I was wearing this when I woke up in the shelter. Ballerina watch. Kind of childish. -There must be a... -A million. -Who's Dr. Rob? -My orthodontist. I had braces. That you remember? What's this? I've seen that in my dreams and I pictured it awake. It's a porcupine fountain. I think so. In the middle of a city. Where are you going? It's six o'clock. I have a lot to do before I wake Philip. -My head feels better. -Good. -You're home early. -Someone's getting pretty industrious. -That or a garage sale. -Scotch and water and I'll help you. You come cheap. "Gena has a birthday and we know it." "It's Gena's birthday." "Wake up, you sleepyhead. It's your birthday." -I got you a present. -What time is it? Don't worry. Dad made breakfast. He didn't want to wake you up. -Don't you want to open it? -Hurry up, I gotta go. -Do you like it? -Yeah. Stuart's picking me up. Happy Birthday! If you don't like the color, I'll change it. -I like the color. -It fits real nice. -How did you know it was my birthday? -December 21st. It's on the application. I decided to believe it. Billie Jean King? -Jane Fonda. -Right. I knew that. -Thank you. -You're welcome. And they never hear another word. Raking on about 25,000 dollars a day. For 4 years. 2,5 million less expenses. Gena, that's only one of his scams. -Can't you do anything? -I'm working on it. I'm getting close. -Here we are. -It's beautiful. -You like? -Yeah. -How'd you ever find it? -I hike. Since I was a kid. -In New York? -I'm the first Eagle Scout in the Bronx. -Can I help? -No. Today's your day. -I forgot the thermos. -You didn't. I put it in the back seat so it wouldn't break. I'll go get it. You're back. -What's the matter? -Nothing. I jogged a little. Why don't you let me do that? Would you like some coffee? Not now. Thank you. You probably had a driver's license. -I guess. -California takes fingerprints. -They didn't find mine. -So it wasn't California. -But it's possible you have one... -Could we skip the questions today? You think the nightmares are going to go away by themselves? -Maybe. -No chance. I talked to a doctor about amnesia. The mind doesn't work that way. It'll keep torturing you until you pay attention. But I'm afraid of what I'll see. Everybody's afraid of that if they look too hard. Usually it's not so bad. I beat myself up pretty good about Philip's mother. Was it my fault? Did I push too hard? Philip said that you did everything that you could. It took me a long time to believe that. Just couldn't fix it. That's all it was. You try to save me now instead? No. I just want you to know you're safe. Let go of whatever it is, I'll be here. -We better go pick up Philip... -Yeah. I detest shopping, but you have made this a pleasure. Merry Christmas! I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. -It's fine. -Are you all right? -I'm okay. Come on, Nicholas. -Where are we going? Hold it! Slow down, please! There we go. Come on. Merry Christmas! Get closer to it. Lean on it. Can we have a little excitement here? It's Christmas. One, two, three. Cute, Philip. Stand next to Gena... -Can't I go now? -Get over there. -I want to show Stuart my new bike. -This time crack a smile. I can crack a smile. Don't you dare. How did I get such a filthy minded kid? -I wonder. -Okay, ready? One, two, three. Beautiful. -Stuart's waiting for me. -Go get dressed. Wait a minute. Come back here. -I love you. -I love you too, dad. -How 'bout some coffee? -We finished it. We'll make a fresh pot. In the bag, three of those little cups. Now, she wants me to measure it. I always save some presents for Christmas dinner. This is the best. This is so great. Thanks, dad. -Great. Can I be excused? -Sure, go ahead. And now, it's your turn. It's your porcupine fountain. It's at the science center in Portland. -How did you know? -I didn't. It took some research. The office uses a detective up there. He took the photo. Philip has two more weeks of vacation, doesn't he? -Until the 7th. -I've asked for some time off. If I can clean up a couple of things, we'd take a trip. -What? -Portland. It's only a 10 hour drive. We'll visit Arnold. Wants to see what else you've got. -Arnold Bell, he took the photo. -I can't go to Oregon, Mike. -Why not? It's a good time, Gena. -No, it's not. -Okay. Then when? -Can I just think about it? What it was, it was, Gena. At least you'll know. Portland, Oregon What do you think? -Good condition, authentic signature. -You made a very savvy buy, Mr. Adler. -I did? I'd say in L. A. or Chicago you could see a 25 percent profit right now. -Told you Frank Tanner would know. -You told me. You told me. Now, shut up, Lesonsky. Show him the bat. Very nice. Maybe I should fly you up to Seattle to find some of these for me. I got a pic of Joltin' Joe and the Splendid Splinter I'd like to dicker with you over. -Did you call the police? -No! Did you tell them you saw me? Come inside, Valerie. I know I'm late. Where's the medical permission slip I signed for Philip? -I have it. -Is there any food money left? -Yeah. -I want you to take this. -What are you doing? -We can't go to Portland. -They need me in D. C. -Today? A car's coming to pick me up. I told you sometimes I hate this job. -When will you be back? -Not in time to go to Portland. I feel like hell. I'm really sorry. -Don't look at me like that. -You're the one who wanted to go. I've been on some bastard's tail for two years. Would I break it now? You're the one who was pushing me. Philip was looking forward... -It's not going to happen. -You made this important. -I thought that this was important. -It is! But I just can't go today. Son of a bitch! Gena? I'm sorry. We'll go another time soon. Say something, please. I love you. -Doesn't that scare you? -No. It scares the hell out of me. -I want to go to Portland, Mike. -We'll go. -I promise. -Now, with Philip, like we planned. -Just the two of you? -If you can't go. I don't know, Gena. "What it was, it was." Isn't that what you said? Yeah. I'm ready to find out. But I want to be there with you. I know. But we'll be all right. I can do this. Portland, Oregon -You remember it? -Yeah. Anything else? Nothing at all. -I should be taking notes? -No. -In "Top Cops" they always do. -This isn't "Top Cops". Do you want to try across the bridge? Maybe at Beaverton? I don't remember any of this. -What? -I don't know. Do you want to go in? I've been here. This was a bus station. You remember it? I'm gonna call that detective. -Was it night or day? - It was light. Warm or cold? Were you bundled up? -Coats, umbrellas? -I'm not sure. But I get the feeling that we were traveling down when we came here. Like San Francisco, south. Awful lot of north up there. You give the word, tomorrow I'll start up the 5... -Olympia, Seattle, Tacoma, Vancouver. -What about the police? I'll probably talk to a couple of guys I know. You don't need to discuss me with them. -I work for you. I am very discreet. -What if they ask you what you're doing? I know what to say. Come to the office. I'll want to take your picture. Then I'll buy you guys lunch. This may be the only time I pick up the tab. -Are you tired? -No. Do you want to go see a movie? Then go get a paper. Gena, wait up. You want to see something really weird? Northwest's Holiday Slasher Is He Back? Don't you think they look like you? -Frank, what are you doing? -Organizing. Go back to bed. -You can't keep going with no sleep. -These files are out of control. Frank, it is three thirty in the morning. -What's wrong? -Myra, I'm fine. I won't be much longer. Please! Olympia, Washington Mr. Bell? Dr. Silas can see you now. What can I do for you? My patients aren't involved with a private eye. -Lookin' for an orthodontist. -Ok. Not for me. My teeth are perfect. A client of mine remembers being treated by a Dr. Rob a few years back. Not familiar. Olympia has a few orthodontists. I know them all. -Maybe a name, a nickname? -Not while I've been practicing. -And that's since? -12 years. Sorry. "Miss Sutton was last seen by neighbors when she left her Capitol Hill apartment." "Due to the resemblance to the other two women," "the killer may be the same who terrified Seattlers last year, on Christmas." Robinson, Robbins, Roberts. Anybody who might have used a nickname? Nope. Maybe a casual guy who wouldn't mind if his kids called him by his first name. -Dr. Rob, right? -Right. Short for "Robert"? I believe that Robert Appling's kids called him that. In Bellevue, across Lake Washington. Sweetest guy ever. -His patients call him Dr. Rob? -I do believe they did. Thanks, Doc. Go wash your hands. Gena, it's Arnold. I'm gonna stay over in Seattle. I'm making some progress. There was a Dr. Rob up this way. -He died two years ago. -There was? -Robert Appling... -An orthodontist? Right. He practiced over in Bellevue on 112th Street. That mean anything? -I'm here. -Anything sound familiar? -I don't know. -I'm staying at the Carlton. Call you later. Arnold, did you see the today's paper? -What paper? -The Journal. The one with the pictures of the murdered women. -No. What about it? -I just want you to see it. -Save it for me. -I will. Bye. I can't help you, Arnie. You don't know which jurisdiction. -She went to a dentist in Bellevue. - Means half a dozen places... -Kirkland, Redland, Issaquah, Newport. -I want to start in Bellevue. -How many years do you want? -'79 to '89. For crying out loud, Arnie, I... -You know Mary Edwards in Records? -Introduce me. Chicken, coleslaw rolls, iced tea. You want to know every detail? I do. This way I won't miss you guys so much. -I miss you too. -I'm glad. -I gotta go. -You want to talk to Philip again? Why don't you give him a kiss for me? Tell him to give you one too. I will. -You like my dad? -Yeah. He hasn't ever had a girlfriend since they got divorced. -I know. -So what do you think? -About what? -Don't be a bonehead. You and him. It would be good, wouldn't it? It would be good. Issaquah, Washington Tell me about your client, Mr. Bell. At the moment I'm afraid I'll have to plead privileged communication. -What's his interest? -Same answer. Once I've consulted with my client, I'll be back. I'm a pretty privileged kind of guy myself. -I just might plead the same thing. -He's on the job. That's why I'm here. It was a real shame, nice family like that. Probably loaded up to his eardrums or desperate for a fix. The things stolen meant easy money, untraceable, very fencable-friendly. -How do you know the girl is dead? -Nothing concrete. -We found her blood in the woods. -You looked for her? The father was in shock. Nobody wanted to say anything. We kept going. But I could feel it. If he didn't get her there, he got her later. Do you want me to tell her you're on the way? She'd think something's wrong. I don't know the flight situation. -I'm gonna have to make a connection. -I'll keep her at the hotel. -Are you leaving Seattle now? -I'm going to the newspaper office. -All right, I'm outta here, Arnold. -See you in awhile. -Sorry to wake you. How you doing? -I'm all right. -I'm on my way back. -You mean you didn't find anything. That's not what I mean. We'll talk about it when I get in. How 'bout your hotel at noon? -Why can't we talk now? -You trusted me this far, didn't you? -Am I in trouble? -You're not in trouble. 12 o'clock. She sent you, didn't she? She's coming? Isn't she? -I don't think Arnold Bell is coming. -Let's give him ten more minutes. This is the last call for passengers on Flight 276 to Portland. Come on, Gena. Pick up, please. Mrs. Bell... Hi, it's Gena King. I'm sorry to bother you again, but has Arnold called? I'm sure everything's all right. I'm just not very good at patience. Yeah, thank you. Bye. Was he there? What do you want to do? I don't know. I think we should go to Seattle. -You didn't reach my dad? -No. -What are we gonna do in Seattle? -I'm not sure. I'm hoping it'll be like the bus station and I'll remember. We're sort of a family, aren't we? You, me and him? -Yeah. -So let's not go. -Why do you have to go back? -My whole life could be up there. If it was so good, how come you can't remember? How come you ran? Maybe I didn't. Maybe it's this great family and this wonderful house. -You really think that? -No. So let's not go, okay? Let's not ever find out. Sometimes a person has to look at what's inside of them and not be afraid of it. You remember when I first came to your house? -Yeah. -I barely even talked then. I didn't love anyone. I didn't trust anybody. I do now. But I'm still afraid all the time. What if you don't want to stay with us? What if you like your brothers better and you never want to come back? I am with you, Philip. And that's not gonna change. I promise. Do you remember this? What time was it? -A couple hours ago. -She said Seattle? I heard her tell the boy Seattle. I wasn't involved in the conversation. What? -Did you live here? -This is it. -Do you want to go see him? -No. Arnold said he died. -What are you doing? -Not now. Is this your house? -Stay here. -No! Stay here. No. Daddy, no. Valerie? Where are you, sweetheart? I couldn't let her do it, Valerie. Your mother wanted me to go. You know I couldn't leave you, Ricky and Toby. I loved you too much. I still love you. Listen to me, Vallie. I wish things could've been different, but I have no choice. Mother won't let me stay here anymore. Nobody's taking you away. Philip, run! -You ready? -Yes. Let's go home.
