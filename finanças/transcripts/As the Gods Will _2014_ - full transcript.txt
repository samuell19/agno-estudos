Dear God. My life is... ...boring. What... ...do you live for? "AS THE GODS WILL" "AS THE GODS WILL" The daruma doll fell down! The daruma doll fell down! Don't move! Don't move. If you do, you die. "If you move, you die." If you do, you die. If you do, you die. The daruma doll... fell down. Dear God... ...I want my boredom back. The daruma doll fell down. The da... ...ru... --...ma... --My legs are cramping! --...doll... --Class President! What's going on?! Why? Why did everyone die?! Is this terrorism?! The daruma doll's moving! In fact, it talks! Class President! I don't know! ...fell down. --Now! --The daruma... --You're gonna escape alone?! --Me first! It won't open! Why?! Outta my way! ...fell down! No, I don't want to die! The da... Ru... Calm down! Calm down. What we know right now is... ...fell down. Damn... No fun! ...this is a deadly version of Red Light/Green Light. Let's worry about "why" and "how" after we survive this nasty situation. That game's no fun. If you're stealing, the shelf over there is a blind spot from the security cameras. And it has a game I wanna try. When you do it, be calm and bold. But how do we survive this? Look at the doll's back. ...fell down! Damn it! "Press this and it's over." "Press this and it's over." The da... "Press this and it's over." "Press this and it's over." I dunno who made the shitty rules, I dunno who made the shitty rules, but pressing that button probably ends the game. ...ru... ...ma... ...doll... Okay. I'll do it! Wait! ...fell down! He baited us. Don't panic, be patient. We'll take this slow. That won't work! Huh? Why won't it work? Shun's right. Look. A countdown? So when that hits zero... We don't know for sure, but we'll probably all die. One more minute. ...down! The da... Ru... Dammit! ...ma doll fell down. Someone make this st-- Glare. Glare! Squeak, squeak, squeak! We're... finished. Shun, I'll be your springboard. Huh...? Use me to jump over these dead bodies. Like the vaults we did in gym class. But... Do it, Shun! ...doll... ...fell... ...down! Ding-ding, ding-ding. Game over. Game over. Game over. Yes! Game over. We did it. The button was pressed by Shun Takahata. The button was pressed by Shun Takahata. You live. You live. What the hell...? Shun, did you already clean the shed? I'll do it tomorrow. That's what you've been saying for a month. I'll do it tomorrow. The terrorist attack took place in Romastan. A car abandoned in front of a building suddenly exploded. Sixteen pedestrians have died, and 52 have been injured and taken to a hospital, but so far there have been no Japanese victims confirmed. Local officials suspect an insurgent group is responsible, and an investigation is underway. Morning, Shun. So, why aren't you going out with her? We grew up as next-door neighbors and she's always been around, so it doesn't feel like that kind of thing, you know? She's popular, you know. She might not be by your side forever. Yes, yes... Maybe down the road. Do they really enjoy that? French absolutism reached its zenith under Louis XIV. He is claimed to have said "I am the state," and he was called the Sun King. Takahata. Y-Yes? Never mind, keep sleeping. This will be on the test. Dear God. I want... ...my boredom back. Squeak. Squeak, squeak. You're a mouse. It's almost here. The cat's coming. A mouse? The cat's coming! A cat is coming? Ichika... Shun... I’m so glad you're alive. Where's everyone else? I... wanted to save everyone... I happened to be closest to the thing, s-so I pressed the button... I... ended up killing everyone... --It was my fault! --Same here. I killed Satake. Tell me, what's going on?! I don't know either! We'll call the police. Wait... Why? "OUT OF SERVICE AREA" Wait... Why? "OUT OF SERVICE AREA" "OUT OF SERVICE AREA" Squeak. Squeak-squeak. Squeak. Squeak-squeak. You're mice now. The cat's coming soon. It's coming! Let's get out of here and notify the cops! It won't open. Ichika, stand back! This one will open. One, two, and... There! You can't! Once you enter, you can't leave. What the hell? "Put the bell on the cat and it's over." "Put the bell on the cat and it's over." "Put the bell on the cat... "Put the bell on the cat and it's over." ...and it's over." What does that mean? Hurry, you need to get changed. Do as they say or who knows what'll happen. "Put these on and be mice!!" Do as they say or who knows what'll happen. "Put these on and be mice!!" "Put these on and be mice!!" So hurry. "Put these on and be mice!!" Do it! I’m ordering you as Student Council President! It's here! The cat! "Transformation" We're cat food! We're being fed to the cat! Out of my way! Ichika! Hurry, get up! Shun, what's that? "Put the bell on the cat and it's over." Which means... We have to shoot the bell through the basket, maybe. Only 9 minutes and 30 seconds left! It's impossible! Listen, if we shoot the bell through that basket on the cat's collar, this game is over! I can do this. Akimoto, pass it! Do it! "2nd-year student Haruhiko Kikkawa. Basketball team ace." "2nd-year student Haruhiko Kikkawa. Basketball team ace." For 365 days a year, For 365 days a year, I took 500 practice shots a day without fail. My fingernails ripped out at least 30 times. Now, I finally know why I spent so much time on basketball. It was all for this moment. It's going in! Yes! The hands move? Guys, take off the costume! He's only attacked the mice! Get it off me! At least we won't be eaten now. Bastard! You're the one who told us to wear those things! I had no idea it was a trap. Hey, you said that we-- "Mouse costumes" "Put these on and be mice!!" "Mouse costumes" "Put these on and be mice!!" I see, when there are no mice left, it has no choice but to eat humans. I see, when there are no mice left, it has no choice but to eat humans. Huh?! Three minutes left? We're running out of time! I’m... dead. Over here! Squeak! Squeak! Over here! Squeak! Shun! While I’m drawing his attention... ...someone shoot the bell! That's crazy! We'll end up like Kikkawa! At this rate we'll all die! My back itches... It itches... Who's that? It itches... My back's so itchy I can't go to sleep. Can someone scratch it? It's you. It itches... It itches... My back itches... It itches... Only I’m hearing this. Why? Meow-meow... Meow, meow, meow... Meow... My back itches... My back's so itchy I can't go to sleep. So that's why. Can someone scratch it? What's wrong, Shun?! When you wear this costume, you become his target, but you also get to hear what he's saying. What? All right. How's that? Feel good? Mmm... More, more. Scratch it more, more. More, more... Scratch it more! More, more... More, more... Guys! Come help! Come help out! It itches... It itches... Can someone scratch it? More, more... Scratch it more. Hey! More, more... Scratch it more! Ichika. Meow! That hits the spot... --We did it. --Good, now's our chance. Wait a sec. What if, like with the daruma, only the one who shoots the bell survives? Everyone scratched the cat's back, so everyone should survive. Can you guarantee that?! Well, no... In that case... ...l'll shoot it. Who said you could do it? --I’ll do it. --No, ladies first. Shut up, bitch. I’ll do it! Hey, we don't have time to act like this! You're trying to be the last one standing, too! Who're you fooling?! Guys, settle down! Be quiet or the cat might... Let go! I’m ordering you as Student Council President! Oh, that's really convenient! That's why I said hurry and give it... He needs to sleep again. We can't do it. There's not enough time. Then what do we do? What do we do? What do we do? Ichika, bring that bell! Follow me! They're running away without us! Huh? One is the bell and the other is a basketball, right? The eyes? It saw who was wearing the mouse costume or not. The basketball went in, but it stopped the bell from going in. It needs to eyeball everything before acting. So we're doing this to delay visual recognition. Our chances are... ...50/50. Guess which one is the bell! You idiot! You gave it away! Then the bell is... This is the real one! What?! That can't be! Then the ball we saw before was... It was fake, to make him believe mine was real. Go in! No... Dear God... Amaya... Ding-ding, ding-ding. Game over... We did it. Wait. It's too soon to celebrate. This round, the survivors are... Takeru Amaya... Shun Takahata... Ichika Akimoto... --Yes, everybody made it! --You three survive. --Yes, everybody made it! You live... You live... What about the others? This is a revolution started by God. In the new world, power will be everything. The survivors are good. The dead are evil. It's a world I’ve long dreamed of. Thank you, God. I am grateful. This guy is nuts. Brainless losers deserve to die. They're unworthy of being chosen by God. Don't you agree, Shun Takahata? I’ve never thought that. Lies. We're the same. The same? I can smell it. You only feel alive in the face of death. That's why you're still alive now... You were chosen. Gimme a break! What do you-- Look how alive you look. You've been longing for this new world. Just like me. You're wrong! Shun isn't at all like you. He's kinder and stronger... Not like you at all. Uh-huh. Don't! New York, Washington D.C., Moscow, Sydney, Madrid, London and more. Simultaneous terrorist attacks are being reported in high schools around the world. Though the reports have yet to be confirmed, over 10 million youths may have already died, and... Excuse me, we have breaking news. Prime Minister Abekawa has just set up an emergency task force "National Threat Level 4" "National Threat Level 4" and declared National Threat Level 4. "National Threat Level 4" As you can see, that's one of the mysterious cubes that have suddenly appeared around the world. Rumor has it that the students who miraculously survived the terrorist attacks have been trapped inside these cubes. The police and Self-Defense Forces have been working together on a rescue operation, but they have yet to even find an entrance into a cube. Next, we have our reporter at the cube in Hokkaido. Live from the scene... Damn, just when it was getting good... Oh, thanks, mister. We're joined in the studio by Professor Tadakatsu Okuhira of Toto University's Human and Environmental Studies department. Professor, what is the link between the terrorist attacks and the cubes-- This is not mere terrorism. We're talking about something on the level of alien invasion, and I am not joking here. What's happening here is far beyond human comprehension. This guy's crazy! But sir... On the Internet, some have even begun to deify the surviving students, calling them "God's Children". God's Children? "Danger, keep out" God's Children? "Danger, keep out" Takumi, I’ll leave your food right here, okay? I’d love to see your face some-- Shut up! Get lost, you hag! God's Children... "God's Children" "God's Children! God's Children!" "It has to be God's..." God's Children... "Unnamed cube" God's Children... "God's Children have come!" God's Children... "My old school, too" God's Children... "For real...?" God's Children... "For real...?" God's Children... "I believe in God's Children." God's Children... "God's Children! God's Children!" God's Children... God's Children... God's Children... Ow... You okay, Takahata? I dreamt a cat was licking me. Man, the way that tongue felt... Glad you're okay. Long time, no see. Takase? Why are you here? Wait, where are we? I’m in the same boat as you. "Shoko Takase" I’m in the same boat as you. "Shoko Takase" "Shoko Takase" "Classmate from junior high" "Shoko Takase" "Classmate from junior high" I woke up and here I was. "Shoko Takase" "Classmate from junior high" I see. How long's it been, again? I changed schools in eighth grade, so I guess three years. You look well. Or not, given this situation. Tell me, what in the world is going on here? Why is this happening to us? I really have no idea either... ...but I’m glad we're alive. Yeah, and I got a chance to see you again. Do you mind quieting down? I’m doing a vector analysis based on Helmholtz's theorem, to examine our situation using physics. What? That's Taira from Ohoshi High, and Taoka from Ryosei High. They both survived the daruma and cat games. Taira... Taoka, Takase... Takahata. Could it be... ...we're placed in rooms based on the first syllable of our names? Quite likely. They certainly don't seem to have placed us according to our IQ. Hey, what's your problem?! What is it? Then Akimoto and Amaya may be in the same room. We were together until now. I’ll go look for them. Damn, again? Hey! Is anyone there? Hey! Stop this unseemly behavior. ...suddenly appeared around the world... ...in high schools around the world... Simultaneous terrorist attacks... ...the link between the terrorist attacks and the cubes... This is not mere terrorism... ...the students who miraculously survived the terrorist attacks... ...something on the level of alien invasion... "National Threat Level 4" ...something on the level of alien invasion... "National Threat Level 4" "National Threat Level 4" ...and declared National Threat Level 4. ...and declared National Threat Level 4. There's no help coming. The SDF doesn't seem to have the skills to enter this cube and rescue us. Then what do we do? Isn't it obvious? We wait... ...for the next game to begin. You think there will be another one? Do I think so? More like I hope so. I love seeing idiots get expelled. ...some have even begun... ...to deify the surviving students, calling them "God's Children". God's Children. Indeed. Not bad. God's Children-- "Open the door with the key and it's over." "Open the door with the key and it's over." "Open the door with the key... "Open the door with the key... ...and it's over." They're here. Hey... let's... play... "Hanako" "Taro" "Akemi" "Hanako" "Akemi" "Kenichi" "Akemi" "Hanami" "Taro" "Akemi" "Kenichi" Hey, Ta-i-Ra... let's play. Sure, what will we play? We'll play Kagome Kagome, of course! After the song, guess who's behind you within ten seconds. Wear the blindfold, no cheating. Sounds fun. Then we'll begin. Ready, and... ♪ Kagome, Kagome The bird in the cage, ♪ ♪ When, oh when will it come out In the night of dawn ♪ ♪ The crane and turtle slipped Who is behind you now? ♪ It's Akemi! Nope! What...? Sorry. It was me, Hanako. Bye-bye. Wait--! There! Okay. There! Okay. There! Okay. There! Okay. There! Okay. There! Okay. There! Let's see, who's next? Let's see... Who should go next? Hey, Ta-o-ka... let's play. No, I don't want to! Oh, you're no fun. Should we kill her? Yeah. Okay, fine, I’ll play! You don't have to if you don't want. I do want to, it'll be fun... You want to play that badly? Well, if you insist.

You said he's out of time! This is what you heard. Bzzz, you're out of time. "File size" Bzzz, you're out of time. "File size" Huh?! I recorded it during Taoka's round. It's... Bzzz, you're out of time. I played it just before time ran out to bait one of you into speaking. As long as I remembered your voices and how you were lined up... ...l could deduce who's behind me. You get to die. You were the idiot. Takahata! Thank you. You saved my life. Hey! Your hand! Your hand! "Gross" I’m so lonely... I’m so lonely... I need friends to play with! Hey, gimme your hand! You guys are good friends? I’m jealous... Shucks. That was close. That thing attacks if you're not holding hands with someone. Takahata... Please... don't let go of my hand. I won't. "Die!! You slut!!" Wanna try? Feels good, right? --Let's go. --What? Hey, wait! Ichika! Shun! Shucks. I’m so lonely... It's so lonely without friends. I’m glad I was in time. Thanks. Where's Amaya? I don't know. We were in the same room, but after he defeated the kokeshis he took the key and ran off. Shoko? Long time, no see. What the hell's this? Could it be...? All seven players must turn the seven keys simultaneously. Hey, how many of you are there? Just the four of us. We're short one person. What do you mean? Seems we need seven people turning seven keys simultaneously to move on. How many keys do you have? We have two. We have two, too. Then we need three more keys and one more person? If we wait a little, someone might come. At this point, you know we don't have time for that! We have... two more minutes? We need to go search. In two minutes? There's no way! Even if we find one person, we won't find three keys... Amaya. Amazing! We can clear this level now. But... now we have one extra person. Not a problem. I only needed him to keep the kokeshi away. Now I'm done with him. Hey, you know this guy? You sure we should let this psycho in? We're on the same team, right, Takahata? Hey, hurry up! I know, dammit! Let's do this, Amaya. Ready, and... Game over. We did it. Shun Takahata, Ichika Akimoto, Takeru Amaya, Eiji Oku, Kotaro MAEDA, Yukio SANADA, Shoko Takase. All seven of you... You live, you live. Change into your own clothes. You live, you live... How'd my clothes get here? Come... Come... Come this way... I’m asking you where that video is being broadcast from! No one's entered the cube, right? Don't tell me the media's already made contact with aliens! God's Children... God's Children... God's Children... Where are we? A bathhouse? What the... What is it this time? Hello, I just love everything white! I love pure white! Wh... What is this? I hate people with black hearts. So don't you dare lie to me. "Tell the truth and it's over." "Tell the truth and it's over." Just tell me the truth. "Tell the truth and it's over." What does that mean? "Tell the truth and it's over." "Tell the truth and it's over." It's simple, right? I’ll ask some questions, and you all answer truthfully. If everyone tells the truth, the game is over. But if someone tells a lie, you'll need to choose one person as a sacrificial lamb each time. Cool? Sacrificial lamb? Okay, first question. What is your... ...favorite food? What? That's it? If the questions are like this, it'll be a cinch. I’d have to say... sushi. I like... ramen. Meat. Parsley. C-Curry. Rice omelet. Mille crepe. Someone told a lie! Who's the liar?! Identify the liar in two minutes, or I’ll eat every one of you! Two minutes to go... Two minutes to go... Hey. Who lied? Identify yourself, dammit! Maybe it was you. It wasn't me. I told the truth, too. Then prove it. Prove it? Give me a break... You know that's impossible! You look at me like that, but where's your own proof? --By all means, present it. --E-Everyone, calm down. I’m perfectly calm. It's goody-two-shoes like you that I can't trust. --I didn't mean-- --I know Shun loves curry. And I can eat rice omelets three meals a day. That has to be a lie. What? One minute to go... 59 seconds, 58... ...57, 56, 55... There's no more time... What? You... You said parsley, right? Yeah. Right? Right?! Who the hell loves parsley?! We all have our favorites! --Hey! --No! I don't buy it! I don't, either. Huh...? You're almost out of time. Who's the liar?! What?! It's you! Okay, sure. Hey... No... No...! I really do... ...like parsley... This is what happens to liars, so be careful. Okay, next question. I... I... am fond of Shun Takahata. Yes or no? No! No. Th-This is surprisingly a bummer. Yes. How about the girls? Well, I grew up with him, and we do have that bond, so if I had to choose, I'd say... yes. That sounds so forced... I say... ...yes. Popular with the ladies, aren't you? And what about yourself? What? I say... ...no. I’ve never learned to like myself. You imbeciles! Someone told a lie again! Who's the liar?! What? Two minutes to go... Two minutes to go... Come on. Who was it? This is bullshit! Wait a second. You actually tried to kill us. So how could you care for Shun? To kill and to love are the same. Takahata. Maybe you're the liar here. Is there anyone who actually doesn't... ...like himself? Say something. Something's wrong here. If everyone answers honestly, then we all survive, and there's no reason to lie. Why would anyone tell a lie? Very sharp observation. The truth is, there's one of us who's managed to slip in here. Disguised as a human, too. It's telling lies just to get every one of you killed. Better figure out who it is, or you'll all die. I can't stand liars and their black hearts. What I love is white. So one of us here is one of them? One minute to go... 59 seconds... 58... Time's running out. Wait, maybe this is easy to figure out. What? Oku and I know each other from Daitendo Academy. Takahata, Ichika, and Amaya went to Misora High together. Which means the enemy infiltrator is... --No, wait-- --Of course! Only you don't know anyone here. That's not true! I haven't been lying! I knew her until junior high! She's not the enemy! All the more suspicious that she coincidentally turns up. --Huh?! --Isn't it a trap? I believe Takase. You're blinded by feelings. ...15, 14, 13... Better hurry before time runs out and you all die. Have you figured out who the spy is? ...10, 9, 8... ...7, 6, 5... It's her! Stop it! I said stop! Stop! I didn't lie! I... ...really do like you. Please... don't let go of my hand. Oh, too bad. Looks like she was human. Okay, next question. Wait a second. What? It's just getting interesting. I figured it out. I know who was lying. I see now. You finally realized it? Who is it? The real liar is... ...you! I knew the whole time, you know. What do you mean? This whole game was a lie from the beginning. And there were never any of them disguised as one of us. Takase... Takase's blood is what gave it away. And you're no polar bear. You saw me! Takahata! Huh? Ow, it's hot! It's hot! It's hot! It's hot! I’ll tell you the truth, just as you asked. You're no pure white polar bear. You're as black as night. You're a devil bear. Game over! Shun Takahata... Takeru Amaya... ...lchika Akimoto... Eiji Oku... ...Kotaro MAEDA... The five of you... You live, you live. Walk, don't run! What will it be now? Probably something that starts with "ma". Ma? Don't tell me you haven't noticed? All the opponents have formed a word chain. A word chain? You know, "Last and First". First, daruma. Next, Maneki-neko. [beckoning cat] Then ko... Kokeshi. And then shirokuma. [polar bear] You're right. See? So I bet the next one will start with "ma" again. For instance-- "Fitness" Matryoshka. "Fitness" "Fitness" Good job making it this far. "Fitness" "Fitness" "Intelligence" "Fitness" "Intelligence" This is the final stage. "Fitness" "Intelligence" "Fitness" "Fitness" "Intelligence" "Fitness" "Intelligence" "Imagination" "Fitness" "Intelligence" "Imagination" Let's just have fun together now, at the end. "Fitness" "Intelligence" "Imagination" So this is it. What do we play this time? Our last game is this... "Kick the can and it's over." "Kick the can and it's over." "Kick the can and it's over." "Kick the can and it's over." Kick the Can? Yup, the rules are simple. The one who's it first gets the can from atop the castle, then places it at that designated spot. During that time, everyone else hides. After setting the can, the one who's it searches for the others. Upon finding someone, he must get a good look at their face, call out the person's name, then step on the can. This is how players are captured. Captured players are placed in this jail. If another player kicks the can before being seen by whoever's it, the prisoners are released. However, that can is designed to explode big time when it's kicked. So the person kicking the can saves the prisoners at the cost of his own life. Neat, huh? When the game ends, players who've managed to avoid capture will win. On the other hand, the one who's it can win by capturing at least three players before game's end. So in this game, someone has to die. A deadly Kick the Can. Oh, C'mon, it's just a fun game. Now, who will be it? Draw a stick to find out! Ready, and... I’m it. Of all people, it had to be the lunatic... The time limit is until the sun sets. Ayoop. Game start! Let's go! While he's getting the can at the start, we have to get as far away as possible. Right. Holy moly! We should be safe here... About an hour till sunset? Just stay put and he won't find us. We got this. Actually... no. What were your names? Dammit! Uh, what were the names? Oh, I remember now. Oku and Kotaro... Gotcha. That guy really is nuts. I think... he just saw me. There. This'll work! Hurry! Go on ahead! Wait, Ichika! Ichika Akimoto... Gotcha. We're finished. There's no way... ...that Takahata will sacrifice himself to save us. I doubt he'd beat Amaya, anyway. Dammit! When that sun goes down, I guess we're dead meat. What do I do...? How can I...? Takahata! Can you hear me? I’ve captured my three, which means I survive! I have no intention of capturing you, so you can come out! We can wait until time's up, and we'll both survive! Survive... We were chosen by God! We're being allowed to live in the new world! The new world... You've been longing for this new world. Just like me. I’m... I’m... Shun! Can you hear me? You know... ...to be honest, you really piss me off! You never try hard, you always blame others, you cancel at the last minute, and you don't even understand me! I don't ever want to see your face again! So... So don't you dare come out! Don't believe what this guy is saying! Just hurry and run off somewhere! You got that?! Ichika... Shun isn't at all like you. He's kinder and stronger... Not like you at all. Takahata! We're teammates, aren't we? The game's almost over! Trust me and come out! Fine! I’m coming out now! Shun, don't fall for it! Sorry to keep you waiting, Amaya! You have to get a good look at my face and say my name... ...in order to capture me, right? This way, you can't see my face! That fool... What is he trying to do? It's true, that thing does hide his face, and if he kicks the can and it explodes, he might survive. But... he'll just get captured and have the mask ripped off. Takahata, what're you doing? Come, Amaya! If you wanna fight me, then... What's wrong? Aren't you going to fight me? Shun! Get away! Wearing the armor backfired. Takahata... Gotcha. You were right about me, Amaya. I’d always thought that meaningless, boring world... ...should just all fall apart. I jokingly prayed to God for that. But I was totally wrong. I realized what was important only when it was gone. I was a fool for not feeling alive unless I was faced with death! Everyone living a normal life... ...precious things being ordinary... Those days of boredom... They're the best! Sorry, Amaya. I’m not like you. No worries. I never intended to spare you anyway. This is pointless! You lose once I step on the can! We'll see about that! This armor isn't to hide my face or to protect me from an explosion. It's to do this! Shun... That's enough. Don't do it! Shun! Satake... Shoko... They had so much more of life to live... And yet... ...we were "chosen by God"? If that's the God that really created this world... ...then God can go to hell! Shun! No! Takahata! It's gonna explode! Huh? Game over. Since Shun Takahata saved the prisoners, Takeru Amaya captured zero players. Therefore, he is out! Ichika Akimoto, Eiji Oku, Kotaro MAEDA, and Shun Takahata... You win! We won... Not sure what happened, but we survived. We won! But why didn't it explode? Oh, that? That was... ...a lie. Huh?! Made it more fun, didn't it? Cut the bullshit! I was chosen by God, I'm not supposed to die! What? Die? What are you talking about? Huh? We said we're just going to have fun, remember? Nobody said you'd die if you lost. Are you serious? That means... "Now it's all over!" "Now it's all over!" Everyone, great job on making it this far! Everyone, great job on making it this far! Yes! We're... We're really alive... We did it. Here, this is a prize for everyone. Eat it, then we'll show the way out. It's pretty. Yeah. Ichika, once we get out of here... ...let's go get something good to eat. And we'll go watch a movie together. Sure. And then... There's so much I still want to do with you. Yeah. I also promised my mom I'd clean the shed. Do that on your own. Wonder what my parents will say. They'll probably yell at me. But I guess... ...that isn't so bad. Yum! "You--" "You--" Oh, I win! Lucky me! Look, Ichika... Oh, I win! Lucky me! Look, Ichika... What's wrong? I’m sorry, Shun. I... ...can't go to the movies after all. "You live." Everyone. To survive this far, you used intelligence, fitness, and imagination. You exercised all these powers and more to come this far. But now, there's one last thing you need, which is... "Luck" Luck? Shun... I might have... ...loved you just a little. "You die." Goodbye. "You live." "Luck" "Luck" Luck! Luck! Ichika! What is this? What the hell is this? Shun Takahata. Takeru Amaya. You live... You live... Here at this cube, too, the young survivors have finally emerged! Takumi, I’ll leave your food right here, okay? "God's Children!" Takumi, I’ll leave your food right here, okay? Takumi, I’ll leave your food right here, okay? I’m going out. Wh-Where to?! To save the world. W-Well... don't be out too late, okay? God's Children, God's Children. God's Children, God's Children. God's Children, God's Children. God's Children, God's Children. There is no God. You're wrong. Daruma; Maneki-neko; Kokeshi; Shirokuma; Matryoshka... ...Kami. [God]
