The Golden Chain This is a true story about the women from Mahdia, who, after the independence was won, sold their jewels, in order to raise money for the fishery cooperative. This film is dedicated to them and to all the women of Tunisia. This story is not an old story. Nor is it a legend from the depths of time. This is a completely new story. But it's already on the lips of all my compatriots. The fishermen talk about it, while mending the nets on the beach. Other do it while pulling the anchor. They even sing about it on leaving the port behind them. Who was the first to tell it? Maybe, the young shepherd on the shore told it to his sheep? Then the story went from sheep to sheep. And now the shepherds from Sahel tell it among themselves. The shepherds from the south recite it at night, when they lead their sheep. Because this story is a beautiful story about the women from my village. My village sits by the sea, somewhere between Sousse and Sfax. And it's the sea that feeds it. My village is white. Surrounded by the blue water, and embraced by the blue heaven. Always looking out at the sea. Here, the first toys that the children play with are the toy ships. And they build them themselves, using empty cans and boxes. These are the ships. Long before they will shave for the first time they already sit in the their father's boats and learn their future profession: fishing. In this way, for centuries, since time forgotten, every morning, the boats have been leaving the port. Light and delicate, the boats have long oars, and are loaded with nets and lines. They move smoothly toward the nearest rocks and sandbanks. Why sail further? The fish they are looking for are here. One by one the fishing lines are cast. The nets are thrown in group. And every evening the boats return to the port, which seems to close like an oyster, on those pearl-like boats. Good day or bad day, there are enough fish to feed the family. One can always go to the city and sell them there and then come back to the sweet home, to the welcoming smiles of the children. The only luxury in the village are the golden ankle bracelets that women wear. Selling fish after fish, the men earned money, and bought their wives golden presents. The older women know exactly when to pass on their ankle bracelets to their daughters or daughters-in-law. This is how life unfolds in my village. However, one day a big boat arrived. A big boat with a roaring engine. Day after day, it dragged the trawl nets along the coast, combing the long lanes of sand. Soon, the fishermen from my village began coming back with empty boats. The fish abandoned the shores. This is how the children discovered what hunger is. Finally, the men got tired of returning home with empty hands. They met on the village square in order to solve the issue. Some youngsters wanted to attack the boat, that ruined the shore waters. Maybe they were right. Anger can be useful sometimes. It's like the storm that breaks the rocks. The elders wanted to discuss the issue at length. They wanted to talk with the owner of the boat. Maybe they were right. It's the lapping of the current that wears out the hardest stones, and transforms them into sand. The anger of some, the wisdom of others. They reached an agreement. The owner of the boat was a merchant in the neighboring village. He wanted to have as many fish as possible. From then on, every morning a rope would be thrown towards the fisher boats. The boats would stick to it and sail together up to 25 km from the shore in search of new fishing sites. In the evening the same group would sail back to the port. The work got tiring and time-consuming. The profits dropped. "But it's progress!", proclaimed the owner of the fisher boat. Well... We were making ends meet - until recently. And then, due to popular revolts and the perseverance of the people, our independent state was born, the hope of all the people of Tunisia. But our problems were not over. Because the day after the independence the fisher boat didn't show up. The sea was empty. We would wait for it all day long. The men learned that the owner decided to sell the boat. and to invest the money in his country. Without the motor boat, how to reach distant waters? Oaring 25 km in the morning and 25 km in the evening? Impossible. A whole day would not be enough! The youngsters would say: "He came with one boat and now has six of them." "We have to force him to leave us one." But the elders responded: "Let's see the owner first." So they chose Ali, who knew the customs; Ahmed, who was a merchant, and knew how to deal with money; the old Sassi, always silent, pensive but attentive. They went to the city to meet the owner. It was a lengthy meeting. "You want one of my boats?" "Pay me 4 millions in cash." "If not, the boats will be gone." "Four millions in cash." "Are you paying me? With what?" Our three friends came back very sad. And all the men decided to turn to the bank. Our three friends went back to the city. The meeting was long and exhausting. The bank was ready to lend the money but demanded some securities, a mortgage. Our three friends came back and told us that the bank will send an expert. The expert visited the village to assess the value of the houses. And the expert grimaced. The terracotta and lime houses: 500.000 francs for the whole village. They decided to show him also the boats. But he grimaced yet again. Wooden boats and oars: 500.000 francs for all the boats. 500.000 and 500.000: only one million on mortgage. The same night the men decided to leave the village and look for the jobs somewhere else. To leave the village... The village is more than the port and the houses. The village are the people who build it, with their sweat and blood. They are now there, lying in white and grey tombs. Perhaps, the women know better than the men. That's why they met in the graveyard to exchange farewells. The women were aware of the sad future that hung over their families, possibly ending in homelessness and beggary. Who lives by the sea knows that seaweed which sticks to the rock is alive, and the one which detaches itself, soon will face death. The seaweed that holds on to the rock is a living one. The one which sets itself free faces death. And the young girls from my village finally said "No!" "We'll not become dead seaweeds." They went from door to door and gathered all the ankle bracelets, that were given to them. From every street many girls emerged carrying golden ankle bracelets. The expert estimated their value: more than 4 million. The elders realized that there's more wisdom in the heart of a woman, than in the head of an elder. With the women's bracelets, the heritage of my village, the boat for the village was bought: the promise of our future small fleet. At dawn of our independence the men from my village, standing on our new boat and waving our flag greeted the women from my village. For although now their feet were lighter they held their heads high, looking proudly to the future. Subs by Beleco â˜­
