Everyone talks about geniuses. Books are written on them. Movies are made on them. But silly people in our society neither get respect nor are stories written about them. We've mustered the courage to show the story of a family whose ill behavior has been continuing for generations now. Let's begin with the battle of 1971… when the neighboring country attacked us. Hey, what's that? This is the family of Zakhmi Singh. The plane of enemy threw a bomb into their village. Instead of running away from there, these people gathered around the bomb to look at it. For some reason, the bomb didn't explode, and they were safe. But they left no stone unturned to make sure they die. Zakhmi Singh picked up the bomb and ran home claiming that since the bomb fell on his farm, the bomb belonged to him. On his way, Zakhmi felt that because the bomb fell down, something was stuck in it. So, he took it out. MARTYR ZAKHMI SINGH Zakhmi didn't survive, but he left behind his next generation. DAFTAR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, PATIALA But since then, this family has been asking the government to declare their father a martyr as he laid down his life in the battle of 1971. They say one's genes travel ahead. Zakhmi's next generation is also one step ahead. Hey, be careful. They were repairing their fan for three days continuously, but they didn't succeed. -Let's see. -Come on, hurry up! Is the fuse not working? On the third day, the mechanic told them that… their fans and lights were perfectly fine. Your fans and lights are fine. There is a power cut. Go and pay the bill. How-- Alright. Now, let's meet the next generation. This is Deep. A little sane among all the idiots. PUNJAB KHARAR To BASSI He's headed to pay the electricity bill today. Come on. Uncle, check if the money is safe. Talk softly. There are pickpockets on the bus. Uncle, I don't understand. Why do we have to pay the bill? We can request them to waive our bill. We're the family of a martyr. No need to request anyone. We'll just connect the wire to the pole. Why take favors from the government? Have some shame, Uncle. We call ourselves the family of a martyr. Will it look good if we steal the electricity? Is this why Grandpa picked up the bomb? You do have a point. Here's the bill. You can pay the bill online. Why do you crowd here? We've been standing in line for two hours now. He means online, not line, Uncle. On the computer. We don't know how to pay the bill online. Anyway, how would we know who's getting that money? Why are you rushing? What's wrong with you? Come on, Uncle. We'll miss the bus. -No, we won't. -Hurry up! Let's go and have gol gappe. But we will be late. Yes. That's true. -But the bus-- -It'll be here any moment. What do you want, son? I'm sorry, ma'am. What's the matter? Nothing. Come on, get in. Hurry up. -Where are you going? -Get in, Uncle. This is not our bus. Look at the board. Oh, just ignore the board! Nonsense! I'll slap you! What nonsense are you talking about? I didn't mean to disrespect you. Get in. -Yeah, you've given me a lot of respect. -Come on. Nonsense! Let's go. Yes? Two for Koom Kalan. Two for Koom Kalan. Koom Kalan! There you go. Here. Yes? Two for Koom Kalan. Uncle, give him the money. What are we going to do in Koom Kalan? We need to go elsewhere. Uncle, I have some work there. Now that we've come out, let's finish all our work. You never have work in your own village. What will you do in this village? Uncle, when you find out what work I have, you'll be thankful that I didn't do it in our village. I wonder what work you have! Nonsense! I'll slap you! What did I say, Uncle? I was just talking normally. You always disrespect me! Stop the bus! Come on, Koom Kalan is here, please get down! Come on. -Come on! -At least tell me where you're going. Come with me, Uncle. Let's go. See you. -I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. -Bye. At least tell me what work you have! I can't tell you, Uncle. -But you can take me along?! -No. Unless you tell me, I'll sit right here. I'm not coming. Get up, I'll tell you. -I won't tell you. -I'll slap you! Tell me! Uncle, do you see that girl in the yellow dress? I'm having an affair with her. Since when? Since 2-3 hours. -Since so long?! -Yes. And you're telling me now? I didn't have time. Let's go, or we'll lose her. Just come with me. You'll get me into trouble. You won't get into any trouble. Kartar, when will the power be back? Oh, God! Mom, Sukh has gone to the department to register a complaint. It will be back soon. There, Sukh is back! What did the department people say? I've lodged a report. -It'll be back soon. -Okay. I'll talk to your dad. We'll come and meet them officially. Let's first find out if she's married, Uncle. Have some shame. You're in love with a married woman?! -Is Aunt not married? -She is. Don't you love her? You always trick me with words. Who are you? He is my uncle. -Who are you? -He's my nephew. Who are you both? -Uncle and nephew. -Uncle and nephew. I see, you've come from the electricity department! How do you know? Our girl just lodged a complaint. The meter has been emitting sparks. The whole village has electricity except for us. Why did you send your girl? You should have sent her husband. She's not married. Oh! Anyway, forget it. Please come in. -What-- -Yes, they want us to go in. Okay. Let's go, Uncle. Stop it-- Check the meter, Uncle. Where's the meter? You think I carry it in my lap?! -It's right there! -Okay. We don't have any tools. Ma'am… -we forgot our tools on the bus. -Yeah. Do you have any tools? Yes, I'll get them. Okay. -Sukh, put the clothes on the terrace. -Sukh! Okay, Mom. Ma'am, don't you put clothes in the bathroom? You idiot, I meant to say put them to dry! Oh, to dry. -Here. -Okay. -You?! -Yes. The electricity department has sent them. -These people? -Yes. Yes. Uncle joined the department just today. They sent us to you. -Uncle-- -I joined the department today. I hope I don't get electrocuted. We'll manage it. Everything will be repaired. Well, ma'am, I need to go and check the wires upstairs. From where should I go upstairs? I can't find the way. Can't you see the stairs? Go from here! Oh, I see. The stairs. I didn't notice it. It looks like someone hung this meter to death. -Is the power back? -No. Greetings. -You? -Well… I came to check the wires. Go ahead. Okay. -Did you put the clothes to dry? -Why? What's the matter? Do you have a rope? Even we could have tied it with the ropes. You repair the meter. I'll do it. I can't do it when someone is watching though. Step back a bit. You may get electrocuted. I'll just tie it using my underwear. If these ropes aren't enough to dry the clothes… put the clothes on the wires. Just call me. I'll arrange them from there. Yes. Oh my God! You idiots, what have you done? -Uncle, what happened? -There is smoke coming out. -From the meter? -And from me. Oh, no. Don't worry. I'll bring a better mechanic next time. -Come on. -See you, Ms. Sukh. -What's wrong? -I don't know. They ran away. Oh, the meter is burning. Uncle, what is that? It's my underwear. Uncle, we have pillow covers that look like that. Your aunt sewed it using those covers. That's why it looks weird. I'll slap you! Thank God I was wearing a loincloth. -Son. -Yes? Sell my earrings tomorrow morning and get a generator. -Okay. -That won't be necessary, Mom. The guys from the department said they'd send a better mechanic tomorrow. Go to sleep now. Ladies, elders, kids, and friends… look at me for a minute because this concerns your eyes. Sit, sir. So, the wise say, "When you lose your teeth, you lose taste, but when you lose your eyes, you lose the world. " If you ladies and elders have a cataract, or your eyes are watery… I have a solution for all such problems. Made with thousands of herbs… this kohl is called, -Tirchhi Nazar Kohl. -Hey! -Yes, ma'am, I'm coming. -Listen! Coming, ma'am. The stick is free of cost. Only the bottle costs Rs. 20. Hold on, I'm getting a call. Hold on. Look, I'm getting calls from outside as well. I don't sell the kohl outside because the toll is very heavy. -Hold on, ma'am. Hello. -Where are you, brother-in-law? I'm selling the kohl. Stop selling the kohl and meet me quickly. There's a big order. -Really? -Come quickly. Okay. Ma'am, I'll sell you the kohl next time. There's a big order. Bye. Remember the kohl. Take this, Deep. It will suit you. You'll look very handsome in this. It's great. I'll return it in the evening. Yes, but don't remove the price tag. We can't return it later. I won't remove it, but we'll have to adjust like this for a few days. Of course. Anything for you. Go, have fun. -I'm taking a few more clothes. -That's fine, buddy! Deep, are you crazy? How will I repair the meter? Brother-in-law, these people own 150 buses. If you repair their meter and get the power back, then no one other than you will get on those buses. Your kohl will sell everywhere. Gradually, it'll even sell in foreign countries. One fine day, everyone's eyes will be black with your kohl. -Really? -Yes. Listen, you need to send ten cartons to Australia, 25 cartons to-- Come on, move faster. Yes, so, 25 cartons to Japan, and only three to Thailand. Our kohl doesn't sell much over there. Very good! Send them! -Brother-in-law. -Yes? -Where were you lost? -Deep… tell me if there's anything else in their house that doesn't work. -I'll repair that as well. -Come on. -Greetings! -Greetings! You're here! Yes. He'll repair your meter and get back the power. Seems like he needs some repairing himself. He looks like someone who sells kohl on buses. No, don't judge him by his face. He looks like that because he fell off an electric pole. He's a great mechanic. -Yes. -Very talented. He'll repair it. Yes, I'll do it. -There's the tool. -Yes. Go. There it is. You are back again?! I'll have to come until your power is back. What? I'll go upstairs and check the wires. -The meter is over there. -Okay. Will it be repaired today? Yes, have faith in God. Not in you? -Yes? -I'm here to connect the wires. The wires are over there. Let's connect them here first. Do what you have to do quickly. My grandma faced discomfort all night. So did I. What? I mean, how can I connect the wires so quickly? Let me muster the courage to do that first. You've never connected wires before?! I never found such a beautiful wire to connect with. I don't get it. I don't get it either. Just take my phone number. -What? -Note it down. Ma'am, which routes do your buses take? Our fans aren't working. Forget about the buses. You repair the meter! To hell with the buses! Deep said they own buses. Ma'am, is your vision blurry? Have you come here to repair the meter or my eyes? He's trying to be an eye specialist! Do your work! -Mr. Mechanic. -Yes? These wires are broken. I think if you join them, they'll work. Our electricity may be back. Yes. Ms. Sukh, I think we should let the electricity department handle it. -Why take a risk? -You're not from the department?! I am, but not fully. I mean… I started liking you the time I saw you there. So, I started following you. I swear on you… since the time I saw you, I can't think of anything else. Really. Yes. I hope I don't end up hugging these live wires instead of you. You came here to hug me?! Mom-- My brother-in-law is also here. I'll remain unmarried, and his marriage will also be ruined. What happened, Sukh? Nothing. Is power back? -Yeah-- -No. Mom will come upstairs to check what you're doing. Do something. Join the wires. Yes, I'll join the wires. But if anything happens to me, let me tell you… I love you. What? I love you. Back off. There's going to be a spark. There is no current. My kohl! Get out of here! We'll get a generator installed! To hell with these mechanics! Brother-in-law, hear me out. -Get lost! Rascal! -Brother-in-law, talk softly. You're spitting kohl on me. The idiot burned everything. Kartar, what's this kohl-like thing coming out of the meter? Mom… he's called experienced guys from the department tomorrow morning. The power will be back tomorrow. Call painters as well. The whole house has turned black. I wonder what that kohl-like stuff was! I swear on you… since the time I saw you, I can't think of anything else. I love you. What? I love you. -The power is back, ma'am. -Thank God! God bless you, dear. I'll get going. Okay. There you go. We don't need these hand fans anymore. To hell with these electricity guys! Sukh! Yes, Grandma! The mechanic must be there outside! Call him back! Grandma, he's gone already. I'll lodge a complaint over the phone. Hurry up! Yes, Sukh. How do you know it's me? I was missing you a lot. Who else could it be? Okay, listen. Come and connect the wires. The wires are connected already. Now, just the current has to pass. Don't get too excited. I meant the electric wires. Even I meant the electric wires. Now come quickly.

Why don't you remove the tag on the shirt? No. This is the fashion these days, Sukh. What fashion? It looks bad. No, Sukh. -What? -I need to return it. What do you mean? I don't have good clothes. I borrow them from my friend's store… so that I can impress you. I like you the way you are. What happened? This isn't right, Sukh. We are not married yet. Don't you think you're too old-fashioned? The world is advanced now. I'll accept the world is advanced… the day we think that even our sisters can do whatever they want before marriage. I swear on the river in the village I swear on the river in the village If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet I'll kiss your lane Then I'll kiss your city I'll become the anklet on your feet And kiss them I'll become the anklet on your feet And kiss them Don't look at a stranger If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet If you don't want to make me your lover Make me the anklet on your feet By God's grace, Manjyot, the boy has found a beautiful girl. Apply a black dot when you wake up in the morning. -Here, have some sweets. -No. -You don't eat sweets?! -No. How will you manage? Never mind. Here, have something savory. There you go. Stop it. Why are you surrounding her? Look at the time. Let her go to her husband now. Nonsense! She must be tired since morning. Let me see where Deep is. Deep! -Yes? -This man and cot are from the same house. -Go, drop them off. -Me?! Then, who else? Me? Let's go. Come on. -Pick it up. -True. This is so funny. -He shouldn't have drunk so much. -He should have some control. Take him. It's in reverse gear like the tractor. It's okay. Stop it now! You've drunk enough. It's midnight. Oh, really? Where have you sent Deep? He's gone to drop someone off, sister. Now, stand up! You've had enough! -Get up! -We're coming, sister. -Come on now! -Let's go. -Oh, no! -They're trying to trick me. Girls, take the daughter-in-law. Deep is also coming. Come on. Let's go. Here's the milk. Both of you drink it. -Come on. -Let's go. Go. -Let's go now. -What are you waiting here for? What happened? What's this? What happened? Look at them lying here like dead dogs! Get up! The bride and groom will sleep here! Come on, wake them up! Yes. -Get up! -Wake up! Have some shame. Why are you sleeping here? -Seriously! -Wake them up, sister. Get up, guys! Get up! -Move, Auntie. -Yes. I'll wake them up. These many people were not even at my wedding! Get up! Get up! Wake up! -They won't get up, dear. -Wake up! -Kuljeet Kaur, -Yes? let them sleep in your room tonight. But Mom, all the elders are sleeping in my room. To hell with them! Throw them out! Auntie, I can throw each of them out myself… but it'll be morning by then. We need the night. -Get up! -It's futile to get angry, sister. Let the daughter-in-law sleep with the ladies tonight. It's okay, Deep. Just sleep with them tonight somehow. -With them?! -Yes. -Just tonight. -But there's no place on the bed. -Go, girls. Go. -Please manage it. -Come on. -Let's go. Come on. Go. Milk? Come, dear. At least tell me whom to sleep with after drinking this milk! With the brother-in-law or Uncle? What kind of wedding night is this? Sukh. Sukh. Uncle was troubling me there, and Auntie is troubling me here. Sukh. Come here. What is it? -Come outside. -No. Come outside. We're married. Come on. Come. What? We're married. Why are you scared? We can at least meet outside. Come on. You haven't slept yet?! Sukh, I find this weird. We got married so we could be together, not separated. Never mind. When all the relatives leave, we'll be together. That's fine, but it's the first day that matters. -Girl! -Run away! -There is a girl! -There's no girl! -Girl! -There's no girl, Uncle! -There's no girl! -There is a girl! -There's no girl! -What happened? Auntie, Uncle is sleepwalking again. He thinks there was a girl here. Hey! I'll thrash you! Come on! -Come on! -Let's go! -This is his old habit. -Yes. -Let's go. -Let's go. He disturbed everyone's sleep! -Let's go. Come on. -Let's go. -Come on. -He disturbed everyone's sleep. It was a girl, wasn't it? -Auntie! -No, don't! -What is he doing? -What's wrong with you? Have some shame. You slept in the room of the newlyweds. I didn't see anything. Five fours are… Twenty. -Five fives are… -Twenty-five. -Did you see that, Kuljeet? -Yeah. She's made your job easier. He wouldn't even touch his books. He's sitting with his aunt now. That's enough, Sukh. You've been at it for so long. You'll get tired. Sister-in-law, you never get tired of working alone. Then, how can I get tired while tutoring him? What you've taught him so far is enough for today. Okay, sister-in-law. Listen, be ready tomorrow morning. It's okay, Auntie. We'll see. -Hey, where are you going? -To play. Where are you going? Inside. Is anybody home? Come. -Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings, Auntie. -Greetings. -Greetings. -Please sit. -Wow, everyone's here today. -Yes, you've added to our happiness. Please come. Welcome. Mr. Baldev Singh, get some sweets. Serve me some sweets. I've got good news for you. Tell us what the matter is. Then, I will fill your mouth with sweets. Your land falls in the airport plan. -What?! -What?! I didn't get you. It's breaking news. The government is building the fifth airport in Punjab. Our village and the neighboring village's land fall in that plan. Your five acres also come in that area. We're ruined. How are you ruined? You've gotten lucky, idiots. The government will pay you around 70 to 80 lakhs for an acre. -Oh, wow! -You own five acres. That makes it around 3.5 to 4 crores. Oh, my God! What?! Carry him. We'll handle Uncle later. Tell us about the money. You'll get the money. Look, Baldev Singh, your son got married yesterday… and you got lucky today. You're right. The girl is lucky. -You went from rags to riches. -Yeah. Get the sweets. Have some sweets now. Here. Dad, it's such a happy occasion. Now, you must give everyone a gift. I will, dear. We got this good news because of the lucky girl. -Yes. -She should get a gift first. You're right. We didn't even give her a wedding gift. We must buy her some bangles and a chain. Bracelets are in fashion these days. No, Auntie, sets are in fashion these days. I think we should ask the one who has to wear them. You're right, Deep. Go, talk to your wife. Then we'll go to the jeweler. I'll go and ask her. Hurry up. But sister, we haven't got the money yet. -Dad… -Yes? why do you worry? Now, the Chief Minister will come to our house and give us cash. Am I right? -Sukh… -Yes? you would have found any good family. Why did you marry into such a poor family? Nimmo, I didn't like what you said. Life is spent with people, not with money, got it? I'm sorry, but I couldn't see the state of your room, so I said that. Okay, forget it. Tell me. Where are you going on your honeymoon? I don't know. Where did you go? -Dubai. -I see. Sukh, the moments you spend on your honeymoon stay with you forever. You should definitely go. I will, but going abroad is difficult. It'll cost us a lot of money. I'll be happy wherever he takes me. Okay, your happiness matters the most. I'll hang up now. He's been standing outside and honking. He bought a new Swift Desire yesterday. -Okay, I'll hang up. -Okay. -Okay, bye. -Okay, bye. Tell me what you want. I don't want anything. My friend is a little crazy. If you tell her who you're married to, she'll go completely crazy. What do you mean? I mean, our land falls in the airport plan. The land worth 25 to 30 lakhs has now become worth 3.5 to 4 crores. -Really? -Yes. Dad said I should ask you first what you'd like as a gift. I don't want anything. Silly, everyone believes that all this happened because of you. You have the first right to this money. Tell me, Sukh. What piece of jewelry would you like? Can we go on our honeymoon? It won't cost us as much as jewelry. Don't worry about the money. I'll take you to a place bigger than Dubai. I'll even be happy to go to Kasauli. Silly, when we didn't have money, we couldn't do anything for you. Now that we have enough money, we'll splurge it on you. And from now on, no friend of yours will insult you. It's my promise. Until I take you on our honeymoon, we'll live like friends. Now our wedding night will be celebrated in a foreign country. We'll send selfies to your friends from there. Of the wedding night? Silly! Of the honeymoon! -I'll be back. -Okay. Deep. Yes? What mess is this honeymoon? It's no mess, Uncle. It means going on an outing after marriage. -Okay. -At least you can use the jewelry later. What is the use of this outing? People won't know what you eat and drink there. People will see the jewelry. You wanted me to ask her. Now, she says she wants to go abroad for an outing. Never mind. All this has been possible because of her luck. -We'll spend that money on their outing. -Okay. Listen, even we've never gone out since we got married. You never even gifted me any jewelry. Should we also go? They are still talking. Why are you getting excited? Send them as well. Keep them together, or else they'll start fighting later. What's there to fight, Auntie? You're too much. You be quiet. We've just got some money. I think the whole family should go on an outing. -You two should also go. -Okay. Baldev, you've never given us anything. In fact, you've always taken from us. We've finally become rich. Now that we've got some money, let us also have fun. Auntie, this is our honeymoon. So? Can't I go on my honeymoon? Your uncle never took me anywhere. He even left for the heavens alone. I don't care if you go or not, I'll go on my honeymoon alone! -Aunt-- -Do we have a new bag? A new bag? Yes. Yes, take them as well. -They're also part of the family. -Yes, absolutely. What are you saying, Uncle? We'll be going by airplane. Do you want me to sell kohl on buses all my life? Don't you want me to see a plane? The land belongs to me as well. Can't I enjoy my honeymoon? What are you doing? Do you even know what honeymoon means? I will tell you. It means-- -We want to know what it means. -Yes. Let me see who leaves you! See, sister said something wise before dying. Look, your side of the family is ready. Then, why can't my side of the family go? Forget it, Manjyot. Don't ruin your home because of us. Manjyot, don't be disheartened. Business goes on. If you insist, -we will all also come. -Okay. -Yes, and ladies can travel free of cost. -Yes. Auntie, that applies to buses, not planes! Never mind. -Two people will adjust on one seat. -Yeah. Don't be a miser. You have a lot of money. Dad, why don't you announce in the village that whoever wants to go on a honeymoon can join us? -I'll do it. -Sit down! Idiot! Listen, there'll be no announcement! Will it look good if more than 15-20 people go on a honeymoon? No, take more than that if you want. Now, you can't say that everyone came to the wedding, but no one supported you on your honeymoon. We'll all go with you. Why did you stop me before? We'll have to tell them what honeymoon means. No. They were all so excited to go on an outing. We can't upset them by going alone. Sukh, the honeymoon is for the memories of newlyweds. I agree… but think about it, if two people can make beautiful memories, how beautiful will be the memories of the whole family? And who knows? Maybe this happened because of their luck. Now, we'll have to accept it. These guys don't even know what honeymoon means. How will they spoil our honeymoon? Fine. Let them go on an outing. Find out which country we're going to, and get the visas. Sir, any country bigger than Dubai will do. Dubai, Bangkok, Malaysia, everybody goes there. If you want to improve your status in the village, go to a western country. Can we go to Pakistan? They say one who hasn't seen Lahore is not born. -What? -I meant America, Canada, or England. -What? -You can go to Australia as well. You'll be known in the village if you go to these places on your honeymoon. Sir, how much would it cost? Look, a couple's ticket and accommodation would cost seven for America, six for Canada, and five for England. -Uncle! -What happened? You continue. Uncle keeps falling. -Yeah. -That's too much. A lot of us will be traveling. -I see. -Give us some discount. Tell me, where are the other married couples? -We're all here. -Yes. Did your dad also get married recently? -No-- -He has grandsons as well, -but he wants to go on a honeymoon now. -Yes. The boys will be busy with their wives. We'll truly enjoy our honeymoon there. Absolutely. Right? Yes, we will. -We'll manage the accommodation and food. -Yes. Just tell us how much the journey will cost us. Look, the cheapest is England. One lakh per person. That's it, then. We're around 18 to 20 people. -Get us visas. -Alright, then. Hold on. Dad, do we have 18 to 20 lakhs? -Over here. -Yeah. I'll do it wherever you tell me to. Wonderful. Here's a check for 20 lakhs. The rest will be transferred to your account gradually. -Mister. -Yes? The day we get the government money… -we'll repay you. -Yes. I've kept your documents safe. You're a millionaire now. We'll give the documents to the government when they ask for them. -Okay. -Greetings. -Greetings. -Greetings. Why are you sulking? What happened? -Look, now that we are going to England, -Yeah? if you start dating a foreigner there, don't ever talk to me! If I start dating a foreigner, why would I talk to you anyway? Don't worry, my dear. I don't like foreigners. I like village women like you. I'm tired I'm tired of wearing bangles Buy me wedding bracelets, beloved The world's going The world's going on a honeymoon We're the only ones left We're newlyweds We need to love each other The world is our enemy They don't let us love I feel like we're Heer and Ranjha The world's going on a honeymoon We're the only ones left The world's going on a honeymoon We're the only ones left The world's going on a honeymoon We're the only ones left How does this look? Great! Ma'am, why did you remove the tag? Well, that's because we're going to buy it today. Oh, really? Then, it's fine. All of your visas have arrived. Gurdayal Singh. Yes, that's me. Yours isn't issued. Gurdeep Kaur? -She's my wife. -Hers isn't issued either. Satwant Kaur and Rajinder Kaur? They're my aunts. Theirs aren't issued either. -I see. -Mithu Singh. Mine neither? No. Everyone else got it. Here are your passports. -Give them to me. I'll keep them. -Don't tear them. Don't tear them. Thank you. -Thank you. -Let's go. What are you doing? -We'll miss the flight. -Let's go. -Get in. -Come on, hurry up! -Let the ladies get in. -Come on. Hurry up! -Make sure no one is left out. -Come on, Mom. The world's going on a honeymoon We're the only ones left We're the only ones left Greetings. -How are you headed to London? -By airplane. I meant, for what? For our honeymoon. Thirteen people?! How will we enjoy it alone? -You're on your honeymoon too?! -Yes. Your passport says you're a widow. Your husband is dead. My husband is dead but my family isn't. -I'll celebrate with them. -What? What do you do, sir? I sell kohl on buses. You're going to London on your honeymoon?! Yes. How much do you earn in a month? Around 150 rupees per day. Just like this airport of yours, we are also going to have one airport on our land. We're going to celebrate that. I sent Deep to our daughter-in-law to ask her which piece of jewelry she wants. She said, "What the hell will I do with jewelry?" If she had chosen jewelry, it'd have been useful in the future. Sir, I just asked you why you're going. Sir, I can even die for the one I love. London is not a big deal. -Mr. Deep, I'll approve it here… -Okay. -but I have a request. -Yes? If you talk like that about London over there, they'll deport you. -Do you understand? -Yes. Look down there. -Look. -Yeah. Look, it's cotton! They are clouds. Who's going to send cotton here? Your mother? Oh, shut up! Look. Nice. Where is the brother-in-law going? -Maybe he wants to use the toilet. -Okay. Ladies, gentlemen, and elders, can I have your attention? The wise have rightly said… "When you lose teeth, you lose taste, but when you lose eyes, you lose the world. " Our company has used herbal methods to prepare this kohl. -It's made of thousands of herbs. -Hey, excuse me. Coming, ma'am. Sir, you can't be selling that on the plane! With this, your vision will be fine. You can't be doing this on this plane! -Is he with you? -All the travelers… -No. -try my kohl. Its name is… Tirchhi Nazar Kohl. Sir, you need to sit down! Coming, ma'am. Don't worry. If your vision is blurred at night-- -Just pay Rs. 10-- -You can't be doing this on this plane! -Hold on a minute-- -You need to sit down on your seat! I'll give you the kohl for free. -You can't be doing this on the plane! -Try applying it once. -No. -It's free for you. I don't want to buy this. -Please sit down. -Just try applying it. -Sit down. -Hey, this isn't a minibus. -Stop selling the kohl. -You need to sit down! Dear Lord, it's so clean. We might fall sick here. Uncle, forget about cleanliness. My cell phone is showing no signal. What do you need the signal for? Deep, I need to contact my men back home. I need to tell them which bus to board and at what time. Brother-in-law, you'll have to activate an international pack. -Yes. -Do it, Sukh. -Do it. -Yes, I'll do it… but once the pack starts, it'll cost you Rs. 70 per minute. Brother-in-law, don't get into this trouble. Deep, I'm going to suffer a huge loss in business. As if you sell diamonds! Later, sell a few more boxes of kohl to cover up the loss. -Let's go. -If you worry so much, you won't be able to enjoy the trip. Enjoy this trip so much that your losses seem like nothing to you. Tell me, Sukh. Can anyone enjoy anything while being tense? He'll never be happy. Let's go. -Come on, let's enjoy the view. -Yes. Come on, let's go. Forget about him. -Let's look for a Punjabi man. -Come on. Look at him! Greetings, brother. Is there any public shelter here? I don't know, man. I'm sorry. -Now what? -Yeah, man! Listen to me! He knows Punjabi. Why don't you listen to me? I don't know! Listen-- -He is a driver, not a jinni. -Sir. He's not-- Hold on! He's not going to appear when you rub the phone! -Sir! -He'll be there! Hold on! I'll break your face! You're impossible, man! -You make me angry! -Sir… Hello. Yes, we'll call you later. -Do you even know whom I was talking to? -No. I don't know either. Yes, tell me. Sir, is there a public shelter around? First, tell me who let you enter the UK. We've come to the UK?! We had to go to England! -England is the UK! -Oh, I see. -It's England. -Yeah. There are no public shelters here. You'll have to stay at a hotel. -Okay. -Tell me something. -Do you have a relative here? -No. Even if you did, he wouldn't have offered you accommodation. You'll need to go to a hotel. How many people are there? Around 13 people, sir. You've brought an entire hockey team here. Come with me. Let's go. I'm tired of wearing bangles Buy me wedding bracelets, beloved The world's going… The world's going on a honeymoon We're the only ones left We're newlyweds We need to love each other The plane is flying! You moron, you scared me! It's not coming toward you! Look how fair that lady is! Control your emotions. There are many black ladies here as well. The world's going on a honeymoon We're the only ones left The world's going on a honeymoon We're the only ones left My name is Billa, and I am from Lahore. Call me if you need any help. -Sir, may I ask you something? -Yes. -I hope you won't get angry. -No. Why have you come here? -For our honeymoon. -All of you?! Yes. You've even brought the old ladies on your honeymoon! I'll smack your face! Do old ladies not have desires? Ma'am, desires die at this age. But you're strong. Your desires are still alive. Sir, will you tell us where we are staying? Did you ask me before coming? -Don't be upset. -Why don't you keep quiet? He means to say only you can tell us where we'll stay, right? The intentions with which you've come here, for that, you'll need a corner. We'll need 15-16 corners, then, sir. -Please come. -Come on, we're here. Let me… -Listen. -Yes, sir. -Let the ladies wait here. -Okay. Bring the football team along and follow me. -Okay. Take a stroll here. Take pictures. -Come on. Let's go. -We'll be back soon. -Okay. Everything is made of glass. -Okay. -Yeah. -Greetings, sir. -Greetings. Sir, they need-- What do you call it? The one that's confined. -You mean a room, sir? -Yes. He's a smart guy. -Talk to him. -Yes. I'll go out and make sure no one troubles the ladies. The times are bad, sir, that's why. How much does it cost? Ninety pounds a night. Almost around 9000. Why do we need to stay here for a month? We'll stay here for 15 days. -Give him half the price. -Yes. That will be 4500. Should I give him 3500? -Go ahead. -Yeah. Sir, we'll pay 3500 for 15 days. -Charge us for 8-9 rooms together. -Yes. Are you crazy? I meant, 9000 per day. One room for 15 days will cost… 1.35 lakhs. For nine rooms, it'll be 12.15 lakhs. Get up. -Sir-- -Hey… It's nothing, sir. You finish talking. We'll handle him. What's there to think? Take the bags. Let's go back. First, you were in a hurry to come here. Now, you're in a hurry to go back. Wait. Sir, please reduce the amount. You tell me how to reduce it from 12.15 lakhs. Reduce 12 lakhs. -Is this a joke? -We'll discuss it and let you know. Yes. Yes. Let's go. -We'll be back. -Oh my God! Listen, tell him a lump sum of 50,000. Uncle, he'll lock us inside. Why are you scared? This is how deals are made. I buy cloth worth 100 rupees for 30 rupees. Then, you go and talk to him. To hell with you! Will it look good if I talk to Englishmen? What happened? Nothing. They don't have enough rooms. We need one room per person. Obviously, each person needs a room. That's nothing new. Then? Then what? Show us another hotel, or we'll go back to the village. It's a busy season. All hotels will be expensive. Just tell us how much we can get it for. Hold on. Hold Uncle first before he tells us the rates. Stop it. Just let it be. It's very expensive. He's saying it'll be 12 lakhs for 15 days. Will you pay nine lakhs? Six lakhs. Three lakhs? Don't answer him. He'll come down to one lakh. There's a place, he'll pay three lakhs from his pocket. Will you stay there? That's still expensive. Give us a cheaper deal. Will you pay one lakh for 15 days? My ground floor is vacant. If you want to stay there, come with me. I'd told you he'd come down to one lakh. Uncle, this is such a small amount. You've really lowered your standards. Low-stooped man. I'll slap you! -When did I disrespect you, Uncle? -Let's go. -Let's go. -Let's go. Please come. -Come. -Please come. Come. Welcome. It's so clean. This is Noor, my wife. -Greetings. -Greetings. You can keep your luggage over here. How many rooms are there, ma'am? -There-- -You should ask me that… because I clean the house. Sir, then you tell me, how many rooms are there? It's just the living room where you'll be staying. But we're here on our honeymoon. How can we stay in the living room? Am I stopping you? Celebrate your honeymoon here. You should have booked the hotel rooms. Your family was shocked upon hearing 12 lakhs! Don't listen to him. What will we do with so many rooms? We'll all celebrate our honeymoon over here. Dear Lord! What's wrong with Punjab? -What are you listening to? Leave! -Sir, why are you asking her to leave? She too can celebrate her honeymoon here with us. If you weren't from Punjab, I wouldn't have even let you stand here! Go! But sir, I'm sure you have at least one room. You all will have to adjust in this living room. I'll arrange the bedding. You think about how you'll sleep here. -Nonsense! -Listen, I have an idea. The men can sleep on that side, and the ladies will sleep on this side. -Alright. -Let's go. Come, dear. Nobody's family should be so illiterate. A family should be like that. Innocent and simple. They say what is in their heart. How are they simple? They have given birth to 2-3 kids. They would send us to the roof to fix the antenna in their time. "It's not clear!" Now that it's their turn to fix the antenna, the antennas have gone extinct. Deep, I consider myself very fortunate. Meeting such innocent people in these times who don't even know what honeymoon means is so lucky. If they continue to be so innocent, their generation will end soon. Fruits of patience always taste sweet. To heck with the fruit! I'm going crazy for a sweet! Tonight, I'll get some sleeping pills. Don't you dare take something like that! Why will I take it? I'll make them take it. So that they don't get up until morning! You are always joking. It has all become a big joke! What else is left in our honeymoon? -Deep! -Sorry, sister! Sister?! I got so scared! I felt as if there was a police raid! -See, we are not even aware of it. -Yeah! Sing some poems. -"Yes, I'll do everything -"Yes, I'll do everything -and keep it covered. -and keep it covered. -Everyone has gone to sleep, -Everyone has gone to sleep, -and baba has gone to the terrace. -and baba has gone to the terrace. -When he went there--" -When he went there--" -Okay! -Look at him! Son, why are you getting so angry? Yeah, ask him. It's good that we didn't get separate rooms. Otherwise, we couldn't have had fun. It was great fun. Excuse me, everyone. Lower your voice. Here, the police come in two minutes. They don't say anything to the guests, they slap the owner. What?! Brother, please arrange for 2-3 more bedding. I'll give you five more beddings, but at least sleep properly. Tell me, are we not sleeping properly? -Yeah, right? -He told us an old joke. One person went to someone's house to ask for bedding. He said, "There are only two beddings in our house. My father and I sleep on one, and my wife and mother sleep on the other. " He said if you don't want to give the bedding, it's fine, but at least sleep properly! Oh, God! They didn't understand what Billa said… but they understood the joke. -Oh, no! My leg is crushed! -What happened? -I'm dead! -What happened? Hey, what happened? -Oh, God! -What happened? -Tell us! -Watch out-- Uncle, your habit of sleepwalking will surely kill someone. What did you do? I did it?! There, he agreed! He said he did it! -Make him sleep separately. -Yeah. I have a lot of work to do with my legs and hands. Please let me and Sukh sleep separately. How many people can we let sleep separately? One person should keep a watch on Uncle. Is Uncle from the black-underwear gang? No, I'm wearing the red one. What… Listen to me, everyone, go to sleep. We have to go sightseeing in the morning. Where is your aunt? -Oh, God-- -Shut up and sleep! Asking for your wife! We have come here for a honeymoon, not to create a scene. Go to sleep! -Yeah-- -Useless people! -Son, turn off the lights. -Yes, I'll do that. Look, it's the Ferris wheel. Just like the one we've seen at our fair. -Look, there is a train! -Oh, wow! The train is moving. It's running next to us. Look there in the water… It's great! Walk with me. Look there. -Brother-in-law… -Yes? click our photo. Of course. I'll click an amazing photo. One more. Do you see that? All of them are newlyweds. They are roaming around alone?! Oh, God! Everyone is not as intelligent as us. Let's go, guys! -Come on. -Yeah, let's go. What are you doing? Everyone is looking. Let them look, then. We're married. Look how newlyweds are having fun! We have to respect our elders. They are gone. -Yeah. -Look at that! Wow! My eyes have frozen The Jatt's son The Jatt's son has hypnotized me My eyes have frozen The Jatt's son The Jatt's daughter has hypnotized me He keeps coming in my dreams He looks into my eyes He keeps coming in my dreams He asks for my size The Jatt's son The Jatt's son has hypnotized me My eyes have frozen The Jatt's daughter The Jatt's daughter has hypnotized me The Jatt's daughter She plays with the wind She spreads her hair When she winks She even breaks huge stones Are you any less? I'm crazy for you What else do I ask for? Whose beloved is so loving? She plays with the wind She spreads her hair When she winks She even breaks huge stones Are you any less? I'm crazy for you What else do I ask for? Whose beloved is so loving? I kiss you, I fly when I see you I fly when I see you There are butterflies inside me The Jatt's daughter The Jatt's son has hypnotized me The Jatt's daughter has hypnotized me The Jatt's daughter has hypnotized me The Jatt's daughter -Sukh. -Yes. Let's go home. Let them go sightseeing. -Are you okay? -I'm not okay. What will we tell them? What can we tell them? We will tell them you are not well. Deep, what is the matter? Mom, Sukh is not feeling well. She's feeling dizzy and nauseous. Sukh, what happened? I… What happened to me? -Oh, congratulations! -Congrats! -Congratulations! -Congratulations! Congratulations for what? Has she brought those wishes for free?! She is unwell due to weakness. Don't worry. You all enjoy sightseeing, we will go home. Bille. -Okay. -No, son, I'll come with you. Mom, you-- What will you do coming with us? We will go, Mom. Okay? Bille. -Come on, Bille. -Dear, don't do any work upon reaching there. Just lie down. -Yes, she will lie down. Come, Bille. -Okay. Listen, take me along! My legs hurt. I can't walk anymore. Uncle, you've just arrived here. Now, go sightseeing in London. If he can't walk, then how will he go sightseeing? Take him with you, he is the elder son-in-law. You… -I'll slap you! -Why will you slap me? -You are his brother-in-law! -Oh, no. Listen, he says his legs hurt, but he's moving so fast as if he's the only one with fit legs. -Come on. -Okay, let's go. Hurry up. Uncle. Yes, Deep. -Would you like a drink? -A drink?! -Yes. -Sure, why not! -Which one? -The one which gives me a kick. I don't know about that, but I'll make sure you get a kick. What did you say? Nothing, Uncle. You'll have to come with me to buy liquor. Deep, you know my leg is sprained. Be a good boy and get it yourself. Uncle, I don't know much about liquor, nor do I know English. -Your English is good. -Yes. Yes. That's true. Good Man the Laltaen. -Bille. -Yes. Stop the vehicle. Uncle wants to buy liquor. Hang on, we will be back. -Yes, come on, Uncle. -Yes, come on. Come. Son, wait for me. Oh, it hurts. The liquor shops here stock everything. -Deep. -Yes. There it is. Go and get it. Take it. Take your time. Which one is the Red Fairy? When can we cross the road? When that will be green. Sister, which one is the Red Fairy? Sorry? All of them? I don't think even one of them is. Deep! Hey, Deep! Deep, where did you go? Deep! Hey, Deep! Hey! He got saved. The thing is, Punjabi people don't know how to cross the road. Until they don't get hit by 3-4 cars, they can't cross the road. This is the difference between educated and illiterate people. -You look educated. -Yes. -Bille, open it quickly! -What happened? Come on! -Uncle, you?! -Don't be scared, he also came with you. Where were you? Uncle, I was outside the shop. But how did you come here so fast? I thought you left me and ran away. A car was going to hit me. I escaped and came here. Couldn't you stay in the shop for some time? You said your leg is sprained, but you came here faster than me. Your uncle looked like the Punjabi Spiderman. I'm not from here, so I got scared. Were we going to leave you and run away? Tell me, will you get liquor for me or not? -Come, let's go. -I won't come! Get the one you like! The useless driver couldn't even handle him! Hello, whom did you call useless? I wasn't talking about you. There was another driver. Don't I understand who is useless? You are! Okay. What are you doing? Back off! Move! How are you, ma'am? Hey, you speak Punjabi?! -That's right. -What were you doing? It's jogging. One has to do it to stay strong. I'm so strong. I've never done it. -Where are you from? Punjab? -Yes. What are you doing here? Attending a funeral? No, we're here for our honeymoon. Now your husband got time?! No, he's been dead for a long time. -Then with whom have you come? -There are 13-14 people. You can also join us. What happened? Are you shocked? You will come, right? Why are you quiet? I won't be able to come. I'll ask my grandpa. If he is ready, he'll come. Okay, send him. Let me just run! -Enough. -That's not fair, Uncle. You didn't drink much even at the wedding. Come on, one more. Listen to me, son. I'll make up for that when you have a kid. Drink now, Uncle. Otherwise, I'll have to adopt a child. I don't understand. If you had understood, you wouldn't have come with us! Drink up! Come on. Mithu! I want to pee very badly. Where will you go here? -They fine you even if you spit here. -Really? Go, get a bottle. Bottle… I can't control it anymore. Hurry up. Are you going to do it in my hands now?! Let me see. -I really can't hold it in. -Go and do it behind that statue. I'll keep a watch. Come. Come on. Do it behind the statue. -Do it quickly, I'll keep a watch. -Okay. Be quick. What the hell! What do you drink, brother? You made a statue come alive. What have you done? You… Don't bring all this, he will not get drunk. -Enough now. -Go. I'm very sad. Why are you sad? We have come to England for your sake. You useless-- Hey, don't be sad, listen to me. We are all with you, we came to England for you. Enough! -You drink it, Uncle. Come on. -Okay. It's over?! I just started enjoying it, and it got over. Go and get some more. I'll get some more. Oh, no! -Such nice wine! -Here, drink it. Bottoms up! I need more. -What happened? -I need more. Give it to me! Hold this. -Move. -Wait. Here you go! Bottoms up! You fool! No, stop! Hey, what are you doing? Deep, what are you doing? Uncle drank the whole bottle of liquor. That's why he is unconscious. He got unconscious now?! Get up! Hey! Uncle, there is no use now! Get up! -He is sloshed. -Yeah. Give me one more. We got to see England because of this trip. Drink up. You won't get this over there. Today, we are very tired. When we sleep, we won't even know where we are sleeping. True. Dear, where are you going? Auntie, sister-in-law is working alone in the kitchen. It doesn't look good. We are all just sitting here. What should we do? You are not well, and we all are also tired. Sister-in-law must also be tired. Dear, after marriage, one has to do all this. We have also done all this. Now, it's your turn. -Right. -I agree it is our duty. I am just saying that if her mom were here, despite being tired, she would have helped her daughter in the kitchen. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Let me do it. I'll do it. It's okay, I'll do it. Go, get some rest. Go. -Go. -Listen, give us an onion. Son-in-law… the ladies must be tired. Let's get the onion ourselves. The women must be tired. We will get the onion ourselves. I am going to get an onion, not a rock! Why did all of you come here? Auntie, should we do something? Yes, just get lost! You are not of any help anyway! Get lost! The women are saying, "Get lost. " Come on, leave! We forgot what we had come here to do. They are so drunk. That's what they do. Sukh… Sukh… -What? -Come on. Where? Deep, all this… Don't say anything. Just feel this moment. What? Come, let's go Come, let's go Where the breeze is swaying And the river is blue Where we can talk to God Where we don't shed tears Come, let's go Where the water is like sherbet Where no one fights with anyone Where there is value for life Where no one dies without reason Away from people's eyes You come with me I touch you for the first time There should be rain You should be happy I kiss your forehead, my beloved Where there is nothing called money Where no one is shameless Where no one dies of thirst Nor anyone dies of hunger Where no one has a heartbreak Where no one loots anyone Where great poets live Where no one leaves anyone Come, let's go Where the fate is beautiful And the river is blue Where we can talk to God Where we don't shed tears Come, let's go When you opened your hair, the birds sang They were silent before you came We want these clouds too We want to forget God I should take your name before sleeping Come, let's go where we love each other Where a guitar is playing Where a man is valued Where there are angels Come, let's go Away from the world Where we speak about love Where only we both are there And love each other Come, let's go Where the breeze is swaying And the river is blue Where we can talk to God Where we don't shed tears Come, let's go Who is it? It's a girl! Hey! -Who is it? -Let go of me! -Let go! -Who is it? -Come on, let's check it out. -Who is it? -Who is the girl? -There was no one here! Who is it? Which girl? You are doing exactly what you did back in Punjab! Let go of me! -Which girl? -What happened? He was holding another girl. Dad, he is lying. If I'm lying, whose bracelet is this? Cows don't wear this. -I… -What? Even back home, he was with a girl. You have come here to do this?! But who was the girl? I don't know. She pushed my hand and ran away. You won't be able to catch an English girl anyway. Shut up. Tell me, what should we do about him? Should we get him married one more time? Ask Deep to apologize to Sukh. But there was no one here. You crazy guy, she will leave you if you don't apologize to her. Yes, apologize to her. -Come on. -Go. Sukh, forgive me. I will never do this again! What should we do with this? Give it to me. We didn't give her any wedding gifts. Take this, dear. If he does something like this again, she'll get more jewelry. -Shut up! -Let it be. He made a mistake. Are you going to kill him now? Go and sleep, everyone. Tomorrow, we have to go on our honeymoon again. -Come on. -Let's go. -Let's go. -Come on. Go and get rest. Whose girl could she be? I was with you last night. Why didn't you tell them? Some things are better off hidden. I don't want your respect to be lowered in front of them. -I don't want it. -What is-- Why is that girl distributing flowers? She's not distributing them, she's selling them. Tomorrow is Valentine's Day. Really? Tomorrow is Valentine's Day?! -I see. -Tomorrow, we will spend time together. When do we get alone time? These old people will turn Valentine's Day into Elders' Day. Uncle, you are fortunate you are seeing the bridge being opened. Bille, who opens the bridge? I'm also looking for that man. Do you want a rose for your love? Every day. Take it. -Oh, no! -Oh, God! -He fell. -What happened? Oh, no! -Hold him. -What happened? -Get up! -Stand up! Get up, Uncle. -Are you okay? -Where is your new aunt? -New aunt?! -New aunt?! -She ran away. -Who? Where? Shall we tell them what Valentine's Day means? Those who don't know what honeymoon is, how will they know about Valentine's Day? They will just yell, "We will also celebrate Valentine's Day. " I'll have to fix this in some other way. Hello. Just hold the door. Okay. Hello, Sindi. Baldev's son was caught with another girl last night. No, his wife is naive. She was asleep. Thank God Meethu saw them. He has the habit of sleepwalking. He went and banged into them and separated them. Otherwise, it would've been a disaster! Okay, I'll celebrate my honeymoon and come back. After your father passed away, I have come out of the house for the first time. Don't you worry. I am going to have a blast on this honeymoon. Yes. It got disconnected. Hey! You… -Jassa. -Okay. You were going to send your grandpa on a honeymoon. What happened? Grandpa refused. Let me ask my other grandpa. Ask him. You want to make a call? -No. -Go ahead. Crazy guy! -Hey, listen. -Yeah? Take this. Put it in your purse. We will remove it when we go back. -Sukh! -Yes, what happened? Congrats. Congratulations on Valentine's Day. I got a coupon with these flowers that I bought for you. We have won the lottery. -Oh my God! -We've won a lottery! It must be 2-3 crores, right? For one night, we can stay in a five-star hotel for free. Free! -Oh, wow! Really? -Very good! Wait! Everyone, wait! But for what? Today is Valentine's Day. It's a couples' day. That's why we both can stay there for free. So? It's not like I have divorced your aunt! We both will also go and celebrate this day. -Come on, let's all go. -Wait! This coupon is only for two people. If we pay for the other rooms, Uncle will become unconscious again. He wants to celebrate! -I'll slap you! -Hey! I mean, with Auntie. Here, hold this coupon. Meet everyone. Until then, I'll go and find a cab. Tell me, what happens if we give flowers to women? Love increases. What nonsense! We had three children without giving each other flowers. -Oh, wow! -Keep quiet. Sister-in-law, you're crying?! No, it's nothing. Must be because of the dust. It's nothing-- You are hiding it from your sister?! Sukh, come, he will take us. Just a minute. Now they'll keep talking the whole day. Sukh… it feels so good when Deep takes care of you, doesn't it? He loves you a lot. Brother also loves you a lot. The thing is, after marriage, some guys get rusted. That rust needs to be removed, that's it. Got it. I'll be back in a minute. Wait here. Come! Wait a minute. Brother, if you don't mind, can I say something? Yes, go ahead. She went to talk to her brother-in-law now. One doesn't meet their brother-in-law before doing all this. Sister-in-law gave birth to your kids. Now, she's raising them. For whom does she do all this? For the kids, who else? She does it for you. They're your kids too, right? This is the job of women. I am doing my job. To raise the kids, one also has to earn money. I agree, but that's what we call love. Both are doing their jobs but don't know how to express themselves. Brother, women are very emotional. If a man tells his wife how much he loves her even once in 24 hours, she doesn't feel sad about leaving her parents' house. Got it? I am right, ain't I? Here is the coupon for the hotel. Take this. Kuljit… I don't know where to begin. I just want to say that… I can't live without you. Love you. Go! Get in. Even if the pot is uncovered, the cat should feel ashamed to drink from it. We'll hear your idioms once we come back. We're getting late. Get lost. It was your honeymoon?! Yeah. They don't even know what honeymoon means. Oh, God! I was going to burn the mattresses after you all leave. Why? Dear, the mattresses-- He will tell you. I'll tell you later. Now, what do you want to do? What do you think? We're here for our honeymoon. I just want to spend some time with my wife. After we leave here, we should have some good memories of our honeymoon. -I have a solution for this. -What? I'll add sleeping pills to their food tonight. Then, they will sleep all day. -You guys go and have fun. -No. No, brother. What if someone eats too much? Then, we'll be in trouble. Think of something else. There is a mountain about 60 km away from London. Should I push them from there? Listen to me at least. There is an amazing hotel on that mountain. We will tell them whoever comes to celebrate their honeymoon must go there. -Then? -Then what? You have all oldies with you. It takes one hour to go there. They can't reach there even in one day. Let them do whatever they want, you guys enjoy each other's company. Brother, how will we go where no one can go? -Yeah. -You are my tiger. You can easily go there because you want to celebrate your honeymoon. But I don't have much money. The money I had, I spent on the hotel booking on Valentine's Day. Your brother is here. But how can I take money from you? Right. You call him your brother, but you don't want to take a gift from him?! No, he's just saying it as a formality. -He will surely take it. -Yes. Oh, God! They can't walk properly, but even then, they want to go together. Looks like they won't let the kids celebrate their honeymoon. If you knew the climb was so high, you should've got us a ride. Those who can't climb, go back. What do you mean by that? Let's just all go back, then. I know you won't even go back from England. Someone, hold my hand, please. I am having a tough time myself, Kuljit. Come up slowly by yourself. -Sukh! -Yes? Come, let's go. Deep, hold my hand, let's make a train. You think I am an engine?! He wants to make a train! -I'll slap you! -Manage it on your own, Uncle. Such a faraway place for our honeymoon?! To hell with the honeymoon! Let's just go there. Oh, my knees! -Oh, God! -She was so excited to climb before. Now she's complaining about her knees! Hey… Oh, God! You idiots! How will you celebrate your honeymoon without me? Mithu… -how much more do we have to climb? -Sister-in-law… I don't know, I think we will meet God soon. I'm dead. We have come so far that we'll meet God soon. We have not celebrated our honeymoon yet. How far is it? Come. -Thank you. -Welcome, sir. That was a tough climb. It was so tiring. Can we FaceTime your Dubai friend now? We have come here for ourselves, not to show off to anyone. Let's show her whatever we can show, at least. There's no need for that. Your wish has come true after so long. We are alone now. Why should we bring a third person between us? A third person will definitely come now. First, you go and freshen up. Okay. Hello. Are you lost? What can I tell you? I had come here to celebrate my honeymoon. Those who were with me left me alone here. I don't understand. I'm the elder aunt from Punjab. -You speak Punjabi? -Yeah. Punjabi, yes. Will you take me to Punjab? -Yes-- -No, I won't go there alone. I have a friend. Let me phone him. Hello, Jaswant. Yes, Mack, tell me. There is a woman. She is Punjabi. Could you help her, please? All right. Hello. I'm Jaswant. Tell me, what happened? I had come here to celebrate my honeymoon. My family members have left me alone now. Aunt, are you the one who has come here to celebrate her honeymoon with a lot of people? Yes, that's right. Who are you? I'm Jassa. I met you when I was jogging. Britisher from the outside and Punjabi from the inside. Yes, I remembered. You were going to send your other grandpa, what happened? Auntie, he refused. You're still not done?! Not yet. The ones who were with me were all useless. They left me alone. Have you taken an oath to celebrate your honeymoon here? Look, I have made up my mind now. I'll celebrate my honeymoon and leave only then. You do something for me. I'm shaken up right now, Auntie. -Hand over the phone to the foreigner. -Here. What-- What is she saying? Her boyfriend ditched her. She needs company. I can do that. So nice. -Give her the phone. -Here. -Tell me. -I've made arrangements for you. Go and celebrate your honeymoon with this foreigner. Bless you, son. People say our family helps us when we're in a foreign country… but here, a foreigner is helping me. Only foreigners are helpful in these matters, Auntie. Okay. Here. At this age, she should be thinking of God, but she's thinking of something else. You're up?! Why didn't you wake me up? You looked so tired. Your phone was engaged. Someone has come to see you. -Let's go. -Come. Are they your relatives? Tell him. Why don't you say something? Yes, they are a little bit-- What do you mean by a little bit? We are all yours. -Yes-- -We don't want to stay here, -send us back home! -Yes. -What happened? -Wow. Your father came here in a wheelchair, and you're asking us what happened?! Why did you all take so long? Deep, don't try to act smart! We are so hurt! This has happened because of you! You know what our condition is like? It's like a dog who gets hit by a truck! -Because of me?! -Who else? Tell me one thing, how did you get here so fast? Who said I got here fast? I got here just before you. Don't talk nonsense! -The hotel staff told us everything. -Yes. You came in the evening. You didn't even have the time to look behind. I did look behind. I was going to fall myself. -Yeah, right! -Of course, why would you look behind? Tell me, how did you book a room in such an expensive hotel? Whose brother am I? Yes, you can take it. Where is Auntie? -Auntie! -Auntie! -Auntie! -Where is she? What are you all saying? Where is Auntie? Tell me, where is Auntie? Wherever she is, may she be alive. Shame on you, Dad! You came here in a wheelchair! What about your sister? Where is she? I will give you a tight slap! You forgot your manners?! Is this how you talk to elders? You sound like you're abusing us! I'm just asking you! Where is Auntie? Cheers. What is this? Do you not like it? It's wine. Fruit juice. Alcohol. Get an interpreter. I don't understand what you're saying. What? -Phone Jassa… -Jassa. -Yes. -Wow. Yes, Mack, what is the problem now? Now, what happened? She wants to talk to you. Okay. Jassa… Yes, tell me, Auntie. I wonder what he's making me drink. It's some black drink. Son, ask him… if he has lassi or milk. I'll drink that. Aunt, milk and lassi work in Punjab. They drink this when they celebrate their honeymoon. Then, do one thing. Come here. Anyway, I'll have to keep calling you. If you come here, I'll do whatever you say. Auntie, I've never done such a thing. Whatever you want, ask me over the phone. That too only on voice calls. No video calls, please. Okay, but don't go to sleep. I may need you any time. Now, how will I get any sleep? Western countries are defamed unnecessarily. Our people are doing all this too. Oh, how sweet! Honeymoon… He thinks the old woman must be feeling cold. I'll just wear it and come back. You wear it alone. What are you saying? You wear it alone. What? Oh, this is a battle. You wear it alone. I don't understand what you are saying. Oh, forget it. It's good, right? Sit down. Sit down. Are you going to give me bangles now? -You… -Oh, no! -How dare you! -No! Stop! Please stop! -No, please! -I didn't let my husband do it. How dare you touch me! What were you thinking? Say something now! Auntie, you said you wanted to celebrate your honeymoon, right? I said I wanted to celebrate my honeymoon, not this! What else is the meaning of a honeymoon? So, now, all of you know what a honeymoon is. Oh. We made a very big mistake. Mistake? Ask me what I have gone through. Since I came here, I've been telling people I've come on a honeymoon. That too with 13-14 people. What must people be thinking? That she's so old, but still, she is going strong. I beat up a foreigner. It won't take me long to beat you up. -Keep quiet. -All of us came here like idiots! Before coming here, we should have at least asked someone what the heck honeymoon is! Thank God… -my maternal relatives didn't come here. -Yes. Because of your small mistake, today, Auntie would have been doomed. We are defaming Deep for no reason. We didn't let him unite with his own wife. He had to look for other girls. Now, tell me, what should we do? There are still 5-7 days remaining. Let's leave Deep and Sukh alone to celebrate their honeymoon. He will bless all of you. Let's book a room in a hotel for 5-7 days. You all better not go anywhere near the hotel. -Yes, totally. -Correct. How much will it cost? It will cost-- I've not said it yet. It will cost one lakh rupees for five days. I won't fall now. Doesn't matter how much it costs! It's a matter of the kids' happiness. Money doesn't matter. Give me a shout-out, brother! Was that a shout-out, or did you shoo away a fly? One lakh rupees for five days are too much. We must do something, brother. Deep ruined the most special days of his life for all of us. All of us must contribute to Deep and Sukh's happiness. -The money will then be arranged. -Okay. Okay, Bille, you do one thing… -tell us an even better hotel than this. -Yes. Don't worry about the money. We'll get some more from Aadtiya, if needed. The boy and the girl should be happy. -Now you're talking! -Come on! Forgive us, dear. We didn't do all this knowingly. I know. Forget everything that happened earlier. We just found out that it was not your fault. Hey, come on! Okay, let them go now. It's already so late. -Go ahead. -Shall we go? -Go, dear. -Go. -Son, take care of her. -Yes, Auntie. Did you see how much they love you? What can I say? I am a lovable girl. Thank God, now it's my turn to love you. -Hello. -It's connected. Here, talk. Give it to me. How much should I tell him? Tell him one lakh. Tell him one crore. Don't worry, Uncle's not here, so he won't faint. -Right. -Go ahead. Hello! Yes, who is this? I'm Baldev from England. Where were you, Baldev Singh? I was waiting for your call, but you didn't call me. Why? Is everything okay? No, the land for which you took the money is of no use. What happened? The government withdrew the decision to make the airport. Come back as soon as possible. Take your papers and give me my money back. I'm in a bad state. Dad, why did you freeze? -Hello? -What happened? -What happened? -Hello! Hello! Tell me what happened! Dad! Finally, our family understood what honeymoon means. Yes. Sir, there is a call for you. Hello. Deep, where are you? Come back right now! We are doomed. Just come quickly! What happened? Jeet, how much is it? Our expenses have crossed lakhs. Baldev, earlier, you were poor. Now, you are in debt. The girl is so unlucky. Yes, we should have bought something instead. We wouldn't have to see these bad days. She is so unlucky. The girl is so unlucky. She is so unlucky. Earlier, there was love Now, there is pain There is pain My life has become difficult I was not unfaithful Nor were you unfaithful Even then, we've been separated What happened? I was separated from you I wasn't meant for it I miss you so much The wedding procession came yesterday Come back Save my life I was not unfaithful Nor were you unfaithful Even then, we've been separated What has happened? I was not unfaithful Nor were you unfaithful Even then, we've been separated What has happened? Come. Careful. Give it to me. Sukh? We have reached home. Now that they've erased me from their hearts, it'd be very difficult for us to live under the same roof. Let me go to the ones… who love me. I was never unlucky for my parents. Okay. I'll also come with you. I'll stay where you stay. For them, I'm unfortunate. That is enough for me, Deep. If you come with me, they will accuse me of one more thing… that I took their son away. Deep, send Nikka. Okay. Dear… get up. Come, son. Come. Good boy. Sukh… Swear to me, Deep, that you won't stop me. Uncle, why didn't Auntie come home? She will come soon. Sukh… how much loan does your father-in-law have? Dad, it must be around 15 to 20 lakhs. It all happened because of me. If I hadn't insisted on going abroad, they wouldn't have had this problem. -Dear… -Yeah? they didn't say anything to you, did they? No, Mom. They treated me with a lot of love. Think about it, they took out a loan so that I could go abroad. How much they must love me! No problem, dear. You don't worry. Your father is still here. Everything will be alright. Let the mother and daughter talk. -Let's go inside. -Okay, Dad. Go ahead and cry, dear. Cry as much as you want. When you feel relieved… tell me everything. I'm your mother. I'd understand what you wanted to say… even when you hadn't learned to talk. Now, you can talk. Everything will be fine. My dear… have patience. It's not your fault Neither your beloved's It's the fault of society The nearer we come The further we get My beloved I am helpless and so are you The heart is crushed Under the feet of people The nearer we come The further we get My beloved Make me cry as much as you want But come in front of me Beloved, without you, there is nothing I'm not unfaithful, and neither are you Even then, we've been separated What has happened? My beloved, I'll die With the pain of your separation I'm not unfaithful, and neither are you Even then, we've been separated What has happened? What's she doing here? Soni… What's wrong? She came back so soon?! Mom… What happened, dear? -Tell me. -They threw me out of the house. What?! Why? Sit here. -What… -Bring some water. Tell us, why did they throw you out? They said… "As soon as you entered our house, our son had to sell his jewelry shop. Now, he is selling things on the buses. " -Here, drink this. -How is that your fault? Bhola would gamble so much. This had to happen one day. I'm your daughter that's why you're saying this. They threw me out saying I'm unlucky. Talk to them. They are saying this now after three years. We are the girl's family. Don't worry. We will think about this with a calm mind. We won't let this happen to our daughter. You are right, Uncle. She is our daughter, not someone else's daughter! How can anyone do anything wrong with her? What are you thinking about, Auntie? Have we done anything wrong to anyone's daughter? Why should we tolerate this? We can't sit here quietly. Get up. Let's call the Village Council and the people of the village. What do you say, Dad? Why are you quiet? Do you know why you are quiet? Because when Sukh was wrongly accused… no one felt bad. But her parents must have felt bad. Whatever happened here was not Sukh's fault. Whatever is written in a man's destiny happens. Whether the land price increased, or the loans on our heads, it was not only in Sukh's destiny but all of us. But the good thing that happened was that Sukh came to our house. No one saw that. She taught everyone to live like a family together… and you broke her family. Sister-in-law… you could have fought with everyone and stopped her. Everyone can talk badly about someone else's daughter… but praising her seems impossible for them. It takes two minutes to say that… the girl is unlucky. But it's so difficult for the girl's parents to hear that. You must have realized that today, Dad. Do you know what the problem is? When a girl gets married… her husband's family says, "She's like our daughter. " When we remove that "like, " everything will be fine. Really. Son… we will solve your sister's problem later. First, let's go and bring our daughter home. Why are you all staring at me? Get up! Let's go. Get up. Come on! Come on. We have come here to take our daughter home. If you had considered Sukh your daughter… she wouldn't have had to come here, Mr. Baldev. We do consider her our daughter, sir. It just took us some time to realize that. We apologize to you for that. Sister… Sukh doesn't want to go to that house now. Even if she agrees… I won't be able to send her. We agree that we have made a mistake, but it's about Deep and Sukh's life. We have come to take Sukh back. Yes. Mr. Baldev, if Sukh were your daughter, would you have sent her back? Never. But if the ones who hurt her had apologized to her, we'd have sent her. I'm the eldest in the family. If the elders make mistakes and don't realize them, then the youngsters learn from them. If I were right… then no one would have made a mistake. You can take as much time as you want to forgive us. We'll wait. What have you decided? I made a decision a long time ago… that I'll not send her away. But the way they are standing with their heads bowed low… how do I send them back? You should also forget all this. Even sensible people make mistakes. It's very difficult to hear that your daughter is unlucky. You may pretend like you are strong… but I know how heartbroken you are from the inside. Mother-in-law… Deep, it looks very bad. Don't let the elders be degraded like that. No one is being degraded. The elders have to teach the youngsters… what is right and what is wrong. They would be degraded… if they made a mistake and didn't apologize. As they say, "When someone gives you their daughter, they're giving you their everything. " And if the ones who give their everything are not respected… then that's a sin, right? After marriage, girls change their names… boys don't. Girls leave their families and go to their in-laws'… boys don't. Girls go to a new house and call it their home. That's why one must bow down. Sukh is not only mine… but all of our responsibility. I could've come here to apologize… alone. But giving Sukh her respect back… is my first duty. Everyone had come with me… to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. Everyone has made a mistake. Now, it's your decision. Whether you punish us… or forgive us… we'll accept both. No matter who makes a mistake, son, I've always seen the girl's family stand with folded hands. The girl's parents… only expect trust from the boy's parents. Faith, that's it. The way all of them are standing outside… how much more trust can I ask for, son? Son, take her. Take her. Convince Sukh and take her. Sukh… Come on. Let's go home. Wait, I will get some more. Here are hot fritters for us! -Take this. -Go ahead. Drink up. -Drink this. -Now it's fine. That's enough. One second. Yes, brother-in-law? Brother-in-law… now your wife has come back. Send back my wife as well. How can I send her like that? The way we went there and pleaded with them… you also come and plead with us. Then, we'll send her back. Listen to me, my brother-in-law! I'll come to your house and tell them… that this was all your plan. I was joking. You got angry, brother-in-law. Everything is set. You just come here and take my sister. That's more like it. Okay. Deep… what was all that? The same. Come, I'll tell you. Let's have fritters inside while I tell you the story. What are you doing, Deep? Everyone is still outside. Now, everyone has become smart. No one will trouble us. You shouldn't be so happy. Sometimes, we jinx ourselves. I don't care. Deep, come out! Open the door! We are asleep. Patwari is here. We got jinxed, didn't we? This Patwari… Hey! Speak up! -Speak up. -Yes. The Punjab Government has allotted 15 acres of land to a private cycle company. Fortunately, your land is also in that quota. The land worth lakhs has again become worth crores. Now, we will repay all our loans! Today, we will party all night! Here we go! We'll celebrate later. First, let me celebrate my honeymoon. Get me down! Stop it! Get me down! Now, the celebrations will double! Nonsense! Hey, I'll slap you!
