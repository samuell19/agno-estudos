Hey kids, the name's Vick, Logger Vick, and I'm just about the best woodsman you're ever going to meet, not to mention the snazziest dressed one at that. As I was saying, the perfect day for me is when I can walk in peace without those stinking bears getting in my way, or even a day without my boss's many missed calls, but none of that will matter once I save up enough money to retire and spend the rest of my days rolling in cash, however long that might take. Until then, I'm going to live my life one boring day at a time because nothing out of the ordinary every happens to good old Logger Vick. Hello, is that you, boss? We are on our way. The package is safe and secure. Everything is going to plan. Yes, we will arrive soon. Sire. - Yes. - Tell me again why we are walking in the rain. Never question your king. Oh. Logger Vick? He never works when it's raining. Then, sire, you think we should follow him? Forget about him. It's raining. Come on now. I'm getting wet. But, sire... Oh, hurry up. Sure is raining hard. You are looking great. Yeah, right. Quit looking at yourself. Keep your eyes focused on the road... Hey, need I remind you it's your fault, or such an idiot who provokes a badger? For the last time he was giving me the evil eye.. Babu, quit monkeying around. We're almost home. Oh, sire, I think we're in some real trouble. Run!! I can't believe I've got to work overtime today. That Boss Lee, he's relentless. Well, at least he sent me this. It's beautiful, the latest, the greatest. Am I hearing things? Strange. I don't recall these bushes being here before. Something doesn't feel right. It's you two. Logger Vick, what are you doing out here? Spill it. What do you mean? Please. What you got in the case? It's my lunch, roast pork in a roll. Lunch? You sharing? No, you wouldn't like it. You know we like every food under the sun. Yeah, even when it's raining. Hey, no. Bye. Give me back my case. Mr. Lee's gonna kill me. Arnold, wake up. What? Hey, quit it. Pipe down, all right? We need to go. Oh no, where did the suitcase go... Where is it? go out and look out. I'm on it. Oh, it's gone. We're done for. Why do you always have to check yourself out... Crazy, let go. You want to believe me now? Come on, Logger Vick. Choke on tranquilizing darts. Stinking bears. What good is a gun if you can't aim? You don't aim so good. Oh really? Take this. Oh, I'm tired. What? He can't hit anything. Watch this. Oh, darn it. It's out. Just wait. I don't need darts to take you down. You give that back. Over here, Bramble. You'd better be careful with that, bear. No, give it back. I've had enough of your silly games, bear. Briar. Ouch. Hey. Gosh darn it, I was so close. Why? Where is it? It's got to be here somewhere. Bro, move it. Okay. It must be nearby. Maybe somebody took it. Shut up. It could happen. Stranger things have happened, you know. Eh? Oh, it's right there. Really? We're in luck. Come. Hey, wait up. I'll bet you I get it first. - Hey... - We will see about that. Wait up. Maurice, help me get down. Stinking bears, if you don't give me that case back right now, I swear I'm gonna. How can this get any worse? Is that my? It can't be. It is my case. This is too easy. Come on out. Now show yourselves. I can hear you two bears breathing. Now come on. Do you hear me? Get back here, you. Hey, is it just me, or does Vick look taller? Bramble, you're crazy. Come on. Our traps are right ahead up here. Is that it? Is there anyone more astounding than me? You, don't move. Logger Vick, since you like logging so much, log on these. What's this? A stroll in the park for a guy like Maurice. Yeah. Direct hit. Looks like it was filled with tools. Bramble, destroy. Count on me. chainsaw. It's done been destroyed. May it never bother another tree again. Come on. Aw, disgusting. Where the heck is Maurice? This is his fault. Hey, Maurice, where are you? I know they were around here somewhere. They wouldn't just leave the case. I knew it. Oh, it's some sort of forest camouflage. Stay in your own. I'll teach you to steal from me. Finally, I defeated the bears. Yeah. Well, it looks like it's my lucky day after all.

Tonight on the 11 o'clock news, Australian billionaire Ted Marshall passes away at the age of 86, leaving his entire fortune to the Sydney Orphanage. The whereabouts... Oh, that's strange... Of his missing adopted daughter, Lola Marshall, are still unknown to the police... Where's my pork bun? Who stole my breakfast? The whereabouts of this young girl. When questioned about the disappearance of little... Oh, who's calling this early? I really don't know where she is. We'll bring her... Yeah, what? How dare you answer the phone like that? I'm so sorry, Boss Lee. I thought it was one of those thieving bill collectors again. Save your excuses for the bank. Now where is my timber? You're late again, probably watching too much TV, by the sound of it. No, no, no, no, it's the radio. I'm out chopping right now, boss. Pleasure and work do not mix. You'd better get focused and cut down more trees. Do you understand? Yeah, I got it, Mr. Lee. Listen, Vick. That case I sent you is filled with the most advanced tree chopping technology around. It cost me a lot of money. Make sure you take care of it. If you break even a single tool, you're... Oh no, sorry, Mr. Lee. I'm going through a tunnel. Tell me how to do my job. This isn't the case Mr. Lee sent to me. What's going on here? How could this have happened? Those bears must be playing a trick on me. Oh no, I left my gun in the truck. They're inside my house. Who's there? Gotcha. Put your hands in the air. I'm too worked up. Stay back. I'm out of here. I must be seeing things. That's it. Help me. Help me. Oh, get off me. Now stay still. Oh, my tushy. Tell me who are you? Answer. Did you steal my case, huh? Oh, come on. Tell me. That hurts. Why would you do such a thing? Ouch, you little brat. You think that is funny, do you? Darn it. I'm taking you to the police station right now. In other news, the baby girl was reported to have been missing since earlier this week. Police have no suspects as the search continues. Who would just abandon a little baby? More importantly, who would dress it as a bear? Knock it off and stay seated. You're such a handful. Where are you? Off the steering wheel. Oh, it's so hot. I'm really burning up, and it's barely even noon. Attention, all officers. Attention, all officers. Baby girl reported missing. What? Did you say a missing little girl? People in this twisted world today, make me sick. Hey. You truck, pull over for inspection. Hey, hey. Just get off of my face. You crazy, you're gonna pay for that. Oh, my poor baby. What did I do to deserve you? How did we end up here? Oh, boy, are you all right then? This is all your fault. What are you laughing at? You think it's funny we almost crashed, do you? That's just great. We're stuck. Now be a good girl, and don't move a muscle. I'm gonna need some help. Oh. That's it. You can always count on Vickie to save the day. What? What have you done to my truck? There's the perp. We're back on the road. You just can't stay put, can you, you little rascal? Oh, breaking free? Allow me to fix that. There we go. Ta da, safety first, kid. Remember that. Hands up now. A policeman? The kid. Attention, all officers, baby girl reported missing. Where'd you get this girl? No, listen, no. Put your hands up. Wait, officer. I can explain. It's a misunderstanding honestly. Then why is that little girl tied up like that? What? That's right. I'll free her right now. Drop the knife right now. Calling all units, I found the girl. Okay, I don't mean any trouble honestly. Drop it, or I'll shoot you. Officer, please repeat. Attention, we have an emergency. I found the kidnapper, and he's in an unstable state. The suspect's throwing knives at me. Send back up now. Roger, back up on route. What? What should I do? Oh. Don't even think about it. That's it. You're dead. Just great. No way. What a predicament. I got you now. A train? Right. I'll get you yet. Okay, Maur- Finally. Finally. Huh? Come on, come on, come on, quickly. We got to hide inside, quick, quick, quick, quick. Sit right there. Stay put. I should close the windows. Right, the door. Oh dear, how did this happen? I don't need trouble with the police. The boss is gonna fire me for sure. Huh? What have you done to the house? You didn't. Give me that. You should learn some respect. I'm giving you a time out. Don't move. You're gonna sit right there until you learn to respect others. My parents did that, and it always worked for me. Careful. My hat, oh no. No, no, that does it. Get off. You sit down. Little girl, you shouldn't even be here. I don't know who was so desperate to get rid of you, but I know they made the right choice. You are just bad. Oh wait. I'm sorry, little girl. What the, what was that? All right, okay, sorry. Please stop crying. I didn't mean it. Sh, sh. Now quiet down like a good girl. Let go of me. Why, you little. All right, it's time to break out a few secret weapons. Look at what I got. Ta da, pretty cool, isn't it? They're so shiny. How about a bed time story? Maybe these? Hey. Ah, I know. Perfect, nothing used to make me happier than my water gun. Check this out. What do you think? Like them? Hey, stop it. Stop it. Okay, I give up. You win. You win. You're quite the little sharpshooter, aren't you? Oh, come on. It was going so well. Please stop crying, little one. Come on now. How about something to eat? Only two left. Look at you. You're a little eating machine, so then, kid, done? Huh? No, no, no, the rest of these are for me. Here you go. I'll be right back. Yeah, what... Where are your manners? We talked about your attitude when addressing us, Vick. Hey, sweetheart, this is mommy... Hi, mom. Great news, Uncle Tim's kid, John, from your fathers' horrible other side of the family, and his wife just had a baby. Yeah? That's really great for them. Yeah, we're all pretty excited. We're not getting any younger here, you know? What your father is trying to say is it would be nice if eventually you could settle down with a nice girl, like John's wife. Well, you're at least half as attractive as John, and anyway... All right, Fran, he's got your message loud and clear. Pipe down, Frank. We're not gonna live forever... That's horrid. What's horrid? Are you hanging up on me? Oh, that's disgusting, so tell me. Is there a time something's not coming out of you? Not funny. Wait here. I've never done this before, but I'm pretty sure you need it. Oh, yeah, you do. Yuck. Oh. Lola, so your name's Lola. She needs something to wear. Hey, that's it. That should do the trick. It's like taking a trip down memory lane. Oh, it looks a little big. I got it. I'm gonna alter it. All right. Hello, boss. You page us? Where's the girl? Trust us. She's all right. It's true. I promise you. It's just something got in the way, but don't worry. I see. It's nothing we cannot handle. We'll get her to you, honestly. No more excuses. Where is she now? We lost her. Not now. Find her now. Be quick about it, or you two are done for. Keep an eye on those morons. Hey. Yeah. It's coming from Logger Vick's house. It sounds like there's a kid in there. I bet he's working on a secret new logging machine. Hey, I got it. ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪ Ee, aye, ee, aye, oh ♪ And on that farm we had a bear ♪ ♪ Ee, aye, ee, aye, oh Oh my, my. What a long day. Bramble, get off. Oh. Close one. Since she's sleeping in, I'll get milk and diapers. Boy, what luck. I hope that's enough for everything. Where does he think he's going? What do you think he's hiding in there? Maybe honey. That's what I would hide, only I'd hide it in my tummy. Be quiet. Concentrate. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We got to get in there, Briar... Come on. Bramble, stop moving. Oh, there it is, bro. Why, you. A pumpkin bomb, is his whole plan to blow up the entire forest? Get a grip. That was close. Since when have diapers and milk cost more than gold? Hey. You again? Sorry, sorry, it was a misunderstanding. The chase begins. Too easy. Pull over so I can read your rights to your face with my boot. Remember me? Really tough day to be a bad guy. Pull over. More fun? Hey, fancy meeting you here, you old so and so. You're not making this very fun for me. Come on. Speed up, or can't you? Watch out. I finally ditched him, yeah. Hi. What the? Briar. Quick, come look. Come on. Are you sure this will work? It seems a little generic to me. Oh, you have another idea, do you? Yeah, let's call the police. You fool. Hey, quit it. Try and use your head. We are the bad guys, remember? Moron. Don't call me that. I warned you. Now feel the wrath of the dragon. Hey, what's going on over here? Nothing. Stupid, put your hands down. Oh, right. Okay, we are volunteering. Really? Looks like you're having a problem. Oh, no, no, there's no problem... We're out for a stroll, you see. That's a lot of excuses. Now move it. Move what? You're not making any sense. Quit stalling, and step aside. This is your last warning... I don't understand. Time to scoot. Do you even have a warrant? You see... We're just standing here. That is to say... I warned you both. Move it. The missing girl. These things always look fun to drive from the backseat. Wow. Attention, attention... What's going on? New suspect, code name Logger Vick. Great, I know where we can find our beautiful baby. I was right not to trust them. Hey, you two. Here, Briar, give it a try. Come on. Try it. It's better than honey. What do you know? You were right. I ain't never wrong. What the? Probably nothing, the wind maybe. No way. The wind can't do that, bro. I'm gonna go find a bag and start packing food. What is this thing for? I'm taking this thing too. Oh. It's mine now. All right, is this gonna be enough food? I hope so. Hey, Briar, a little help here? Right, what do we got here? Make it quick, bro. We got a mission, remember? We're here to see what Vick is up to. You're right. The mission takes priority. Would you grab me those apples? Huh? What now? I'm hearing another sound. Not again. Oh boy, enough with that. What's wrong with you, Briar? Will you stop lollygagging and grab some more fruit? Sometimes I feel like I have to do everything myself. We need to hurry up, Briar. That's weird. Something strange is going on. Alrighty, then, that should just about do it. It's time to get out of here. Come on, bro. Oh, yeah. Huh. Oh, sweetheart, Uncle Vickie is back. I brought some gifts home for you. Just look at this place. What happened? It looks like a tornado blew through. Where is she? You're in super big trouble, young lady. Now where are you hiding? Not under here. Where are you? Time to come out. Where on earth could she be? Oh, oh, oh, yeah, if she went missing, that means, yeah, she's not my responsibility anymore. Oh, what if something happened to her? What am I worried about? I pretty much got exactly what I wanted. Hey, Briar, if you could be any fruit, what fruit would you be? I would be an apple. Why would you want to be a fruit? Because they're super delicious. What's this thing here? What does she want from me... Just stay away from her. No way. Stay back. What you doing? Don't touch me. Oh no, maybe Vick sent her to torture us. Oh, get away from me. Bramble, get over here. Uh oh, she looks like she's gonna explode. I hope not. Wait a minute. Look, she's crying. Yeah? Go check it out. You're good with children. Me? Get. Stinking apple. Yo, yo, Bramble, she's headed right towards you. Huh? Briar. I'm pooped. I can finally get this place cleaned up. What if she's lost out there in the forest? Huh? Who's that? Hello, Vick speaking. What do you mean? No, I sent you the payment. Bramble, go. Again? She likes you. Hey, look at this. Oh, I got it. Ta da, here you go. Everyone likes apples. What are you doing that for? I don't understand. Butterfly. Come here. Oh, come on. Look what I got. Huh? Okay, kid, go have fun. Oh, wow. Yoohoo. Here, sire. What? Hey. This is so much fun. Woohoo. Lola. You're too cute. Bramble, we're taking her back. Come here. Look it. She wants to stay with us, bro. Come on. Well. Hey, Uncle Briar. Oh, man. Oh no. No, no, no. And in other news, the highest scoring football match in recorded history ended today with final score of one to five. been tamed... Gosh, why is there never anything on. Oh. What the? It was those bears. Lola, I'm coming for you. Wait. Why is Lola acting all strange? Bramble, try kicking your faces up a notch. All right, leave it to me, the funniest bear in the forest. You, leave her alone, bears. Huh? Logger Vick? Let go of her now. Hey, stop that. You're scaring her. Have you no shame at all? Hey, don't you turn this around on me. You'll regret this. Take this. Huh? I'll teach you... Get off... To terrorize children. Hey, get off. Not until you give her back. Get off of me, Logger Vick. Let go. Bramble, do something. Briar. Leave my brother alone. I'm sorry, bro. Is that what you call brotherly love? Logger Vick, how dare you? I'll show you our love with my fist. Little Lola. Oh, Lola, are you okay? Speak to me. Hey, leave her alone, Vick. You have a fever. My goodness. Get out of my way. He... What the heck is a fever? Let's go help him. Okay. Oh no, it's so high. What have you two done to her? We didn't... Save your filthy lies. To be continued. It's okay, Lola. Don't worry. Uncle Vicky's right here next to you, okay? Poor little baby. I don't know what to do. We have to lower her temperature. Hey, what's he mean by that? Well, I think that Lola's head is just way too hot. Bro, we should totally cut off all her hair. Then she'd look even more like Logger Vick. That's true, disgusting. Uh huh, we're trying to heal her, remember? How about we put her in the fridge? Are you insane? Think. I'd say the freezer's a better idea. Get out of this room. You're not helping. Go get some water right now, now. I can't get a signal on the GPS way out here. This is why I said we should have beaten him up when we had the chance, but, no, you just had to follow him. You never listen to my ideas. Quiet down. Come, come, come, come, here. Yeah, we found him. All right. Oh boy. Hurry up. Change the water. Bramble, where's her noodles? Just a minute. We don't have all night. Oh, oh, yeah. Oh. What's taking so long? Get out of my way. All right. Hear that? It must be the kid. Louse, we'll tie him up, all right? Let's go. Huh? Arnold. What are you standing around for? As expected, you can't do anything right. As expected? Let go. Let me go. Bramble, the noodle. So yummy. Bramble. Okay, I'm coming. You better not be eating those noodles. Here they are. Now what are you doing? Go and help. What now? Oh god, it's hot. It's hot. Oh, it's hot. Maurice. Bear. We didn't sign up for this. Oh, thank goodness. Her fever's gone. That was close. Honey. Get off me, so gross. Hey, what are you doing? Pipe down. You'll wake up the kid. What happened? Lola? Lola? Oh, boy. Lola is missing. Look. What are you waiting for, monkey? Why don't you go in? You think you're so tough. You do it. Come on, tough guy. Play time.

We're gonna sneak in quietly, stealth mode. I heard it was you who destroyed my airship. Is that right? No, sir. Yes, you did. Shut it. Now the kid's innocent, so let her go. Oh, don't think so. Do you like candy? So do I. Hey, let her go. Can you say kidnapped? So can you, man? That's a grave crime. That's cute. Well, now. What do you want? What do you want? Don't do it. Just stay away. Just look. In fact, I'm the only family member that that little girl's got in the world. Say what? That's right. That picture shows my dear old dad. It's unfortunate, but he's no longer with us. He adopted this bundle of joy from the local orphanage. Lola, well, she's my darling sister, so what's my crime? What are you gonna do with her? I wanted her to help me out. That fortune belongs to me. Really? Fortune? That girl robbed me of my inheritance. What have you done? You took all our family money and gave it over to her orphanage. I'm your son. Oh gee. You're feeling some stress, right? Jump. My old man eventually explained. It was his love for this little girl right here that inspired his gesture. The old guy left her everything. Oh yeah, my old man was a fool. I'm definitely the clever one, and that fortune definitely belongs to me, and as far as little Lola here, well, she's the only one that can help me get that fortune, aren't you? So like it or not, you're going to do whatever it is I say. You know what? You're just a big bully. Oi, say what? Hey, let go of my... Uh oh. Oh. What are you doing? We've got something in common, a big old bald head. Oh dear. It's not very smart to make me angry. Take him away. You got it, boss. Lighten up. Light you up. That door leads to the stairs. And to Lola. Look. Hey. Huh? Freeze. Gotcha. Huh. Hey. Huh? Huh. Back to work. Sh. Home free. That's another one, suckers. Help us. Catch the intruders. They can't shoot much better than Logger Vick. Come on. Let's just focus on getting out of here. Follow me. There they are. You still want to make fun of me? Oi. Two bears have breached the perimeter. Say what? Don't let them get away. You two, watch our guest. Sir. Bring little sis here. Let's go open the vault. Oh my. Take the left flank. Huh? What? That was really awesome. No. That tooth cost me a chunk of change. It wasn't helping with your look anyway. You're gonna pay. I think that sound came from over there. Look. Oh. It's bad. You got to come up with a plan. Okay, calm down. Huh? Huh? You fool, do you know how much that tooth cost? No, and I don't care. You,. Bramble, line me up with the window. Okay. Inside power. Really? Boss, how are we supposed to fight these bears? Yeah, those guys are really tough. We mustn't fear our two guests. We're going. Have a good day. All right. Bye bye now. Hey, what now, bro? Not smart. Let's do it. Get over here. They went that way. Come on. Hey, wait for me. Right there. Huh? There they are. Give me a break, you little brat. Oh no. Let's go. Let's hightail it out of here. Huh? Gotcha. Oh, poor me. This is not cool. Maurice.

Hey, super cyclone. That again? Right, let's get ready. All right, let's go. Right, come on. Super cyclone. Wow, that's awesome... Wow, that's really great. How I've longed for this moment.

Here I come, my beloved inheritance. Well, well, well, I finally found it after all this time. Huh? Hey, what's with all this garbage in here? Where is my inheritance? Huh. Finally got it. Huh? What? No. Come on. Where is it? Here. You brat. You are the reason my dad gave it all away, aren't you, kid? He gave it all for a stupid child, for an orphan. Shut up, you. Huh? Stop right there. It's all over now. Give it up. Now why would I do that when I've got this thing? Lola. Lola, Lola. Lola. So long. Lola. Let her go. Lola. We got to get her back. I don't know where that old coot left the millions, but don't think I won't find it. Then it's back to the orphanage for you. Huh? Logger Vick, keep up. Come on. Hey, get back here. Bramble, hurry up. Step aside. All right, here we are. Lola. Briar, I'll help you. That was not your smartest move, Bramble. Guys, wait for me. Wait for me. Bramble, quit moving. But, Briar, I want to help too. I'm losing my grip. I got to shake these guys. Hang in there, boys. I'm coming. Huh? Bramble, you're killing me. Hey, hey, hey, come on. Don't mess around. Hey. I'm trying to fly this thing. Quit it. I'll go up and get her. There she is. Grab her, Vick. Just try it. Lola. What are you doing? My hand. Lola. Got you. Lola. Let's save the reunion, you guys. Come on. Hold on tight. I'll try and pull you up. You get. Pull us in, Briar. Hey, what's going on? You are going to get off this copter, you dumb bear. Watch where you're going. Hey, guys, there's a water tower. Let's try to land on it. All right, it's our only chance. Try to fly this thing straight. There you go worrying again. Just make sure you've got Lola... Get off my copter. Here we go. Oh no, oh no, oh no. ♪ Na, na, na, na, na, na You okay? I'm fine. Oh, the others. Logger Vick. Logger Vick. Lola. Lola. Father Vick, Lola. We're all safe now. You meddling fools, this is not over yet. I will make you pay. When I catch you, I'll tear you apart with my bare hands, and then I'll, no, I can't go to jail. It's all that little brat's fault. Well, I guess everything worked out in the end. The bad guys were caught, the good guys, A.K.A. me, saved the day, and little Lola was adopted by a very loving family. I sure do miss her. Oh, come here. Hello, Vick speaking. Yeah, sure, Boss, I already met this month's quota. I'll have it delivered soon. It's no problem at all, just doing my job, bye bye. Lola. It's a letter to Lola. Dear Lola, by the time you read this, I'll be gone... I'll be gone. I hope you are well, and I hope you have found in your life as much joy as you've brought me. I adopted you in a time of great loneliness in my life, and you helped to brighten my days. For that, I am forever grateful. You managed to fill this empty shell of an old man with love and compassion. I never thought I'd be able to care for anyone as much as I did you. You are an angel, Lola. I only wish that I found that love earlier in my life. Maybe things would have been different. Thank you, Lola, my sweetheart. One day you'll grow up and have a family of your own. I hope they bring you as much joy as you have brought me in my later days. I wish I could be there to see you grow up and blossom into a fine young woman. Please don't forget your grandpa, or the joyous moments we shared together. I love you with all my heart. Love always, Grandpa. It's you. Lola. What are you doing here? We brought her to see Uncle Vick. It's true. We just borrowed her for a little bit. Look how happy she is.
