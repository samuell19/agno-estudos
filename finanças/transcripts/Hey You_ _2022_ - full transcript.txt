If we can all bring out our smart phones and make sure that the app is loaded. Yes. You will see different design options and then... You need to now just click on 'immerse' where you see 'immerse'. I can see a pink kiddies room with a double bunk. Ok. Now can anybody else click on any other design option of your choice? - I see a hotel lobby, complete with virtual people. - Hmmm. Lolade... - M.D. will love this. - Ok... Help me wear it. - Let me adjust it. - Ok. Thank you. Super impressive. Wow! So how is a software doing this? - Oh, uhm... its real time retracing actually. - Ok. Yes. Ehm, what Abel is trying to explain is that uhm... Our app has the latest technology that helps you... ...show fully designed spaces even before you start building. So now, they can correct on the go... ...and now with that app, they get to experience the spaces for everything that it is. How come mine is not working? I am trying to connect. Let me guess... that is an android. Well... uhm... the app has been deployed for iPhones... ...and I am guessing that the quality of your clientele use the best of phones. Ehm... I am so sorry. I might be able to work on something that can make it work across all mobile phones. - I can actually... - No, we can not. There is absolutely no need to waste time on that. Like I said... I always deliver. That would be all. Abel, you are a brilliant young man. No doubt. You know, what surprises me is... The fact that you ...have not realised that the only idea... ...that flies in this company is mine. Yes ma, but this particular product, I can... Do you know how much it would cost... ...on multiple platforms? The risks involved if it fails? This company simply exists today because I played safe. You made me look like an incompetent fool today I am sorry ma. I am sorry. Let this be the last time... ...you tweak my product without telling me. Ok ma. Bro, you're still working on this? Guys... I want to arrange some hot babes. There will be so much fun tonight. Why are you frowning? Tell us what's wrong. - Guy, I'm tired. - Of what?

That man did not come to play. In fact, he said he said he will be coming with a bulldozer the next time he comes. Subtitle So, what are we going to do? I don't know. Mama can't afford to loose this place. It will break her. The real question is, how do we get her another place and move the children? The time is too short. We need a miracle to turn things around. - To keep this place or else... - We will be shut down? I don't blame them. The whole area is getting commercialized and uhm... If they sell this building, it's worth a lot of money. They kept increasing the rent so that they wouldn't come across as evil people... ...who forced an orphanage to shut down... So, the rent is the problem? Well, yes and no. They prefer I buy the building for a hundred and fifty million naira. You and I know that it's never going to happen. So, they increased the rent. They increased the rent from 3.5 million naira to 6 million naira. How long do we have? You know, Bianca... I really worked hard to build this place. I didn't need to and I really don't know why I'm still doing this. How long do we have mama? 12 days Bianca. We can start a special fund raiser. - A.. A special fund raiser? - On social media. Ok... but what's that going to fetch us? You'll be surprised. - Ok... but then I really... - You don't have to worry about anything. Zainab and I would sort everything out. Hmmm? Ok.

Thank you for helping with him. Thank you. Subtitle Subtitle Oh Shit! Guy, what's going on? Oh Shit! My sincere apologies. What happened is that a friend of mine had an emergency and I... I should have informed the team. You abandoned this entire company because of a friend? - I... it will not happen again. - I bet it will not happen again. Get out of my office. Get out! Next time, you should at least inform us. You made us look like idiots. Bro, I'm sorry. It didn't make sense. Mrs. Yemi didn't seem like she was joking. Leave us out of this your puppy love please. Wait... who is this your friend I don't know about? Heeyy! Chiboy! Thanks again for today, I'm having a party later today. Please I'll love for you to be there. This is real puppy love.

You know when you play a video game and you can buy coins to level up or to power up... Right? Now, imagine if as a user, you can gift your favorite celebrity or skit maker or influencer while they are streaming live. ...like the site where you watch prostitutes right? Guy, behave yourself. I am being serious. Listen, celebrities can also gift their fans through the use of tokens. The fans can then take those tokens, gather them up and convert it to cash. See, listen, there's a lot of moey to be made from this thing guys At the end of the day, we don't have to really do much. The user, the content creator will do the marketing for us. You know, for a minute there, I thought you were going to tell us that you finally had sex. Listen guys, we would have equal stake in the com pay and we will share all the bills as well... equally. Lanre here would be our head of finance while you will be our head of marketing. - ...and I will focus on what I know how to do best. - As one who builds apps as a hobby right? Aargh man! Common, you know Lanre is the best when it comes to numbers and finances. - ...while you are good at... - I am in. Guys... I don't... Of course I'm in! Guys!

I just want to apologise for last nights behaviour I was totally out of line. No... you don't need to... No. I just want to apologise. I got... ...carried away. It's fine. It's fine. Friends? Yeah. Friends. Uhm... What did you want to say? Oh! Uhm... I... wanted to... I... I wanted to find out if it's ok for me to come in to see Emmanuel. Of course. Of course.

It's sad to know that we will have to shut down soon. Shut down? Why? Well, they doubled the rent. And... Mama is just a retired widow who just wants to take care of the kids. She can't afford it.

I got in this morning. I honestly couldn't wait to see you. So, why are you back? What do you mean? - I mean, you said that you... - I know what I said. You asked me to give you space and time. I gave you the required space and time don't you think? What did you expect? You told me you were never coming back. Common babe. I said that to get you to come with me. Clearly I was wrong. Habib I... I came back for you. I came back for us. I knew when I left you, you wouldn't be able to do too good without me in the world. I mean... See babe, we have a lot together and I don't see any reason why we should throw that away. I want to do good by us. I want to take care of you. Well, we definitely need to take you shopping. I mean, It's dinner baby and... I mean, you look like you are dressed like one of those girls. Oh no. That's not how it was supposed to sound. It didn't come out right. I mean, I want to spoil my girl. I've missed you now common. Spend my money now. What is your problem? Habib stop. So the plan is to quit my job after I'm done with this presentation. ...and start my own company with my guys. That is great.

That sounds like love to me. Stop... Stop... Zainab! Bianca, falling in love with a mere mortal. Wow! Whatever happened to trying to focus and being yourself. - You are loosing focus. - I'm not loo... I'm not loosing focus That's the thing. With him, I am myself. - Like... I feel like... - Caramel.

Abel, how long have you known?! Since your birthday. How dare you bring this to my work? My life, the kids, Emmanuel! What type of dirty minded person are you? Dirty minded? That's so crazy coming from you. You are the one that pays to get satisfied. And you... you are the one that... that shows your nakedness to every Tom, Dick and Harry online for... for a fee. I could have easily paid for your time last night like I've been paying since the day that I started talking to you. So please... Please don't come at me with this self righteous talk. Look, listen. I shouldn't have said that... Fuck you! Here I was... Thinking that this was something special. It is. I really thought that this was it... Do you know what's funny? The most amazing things always turn out to be a lie. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... B. B, are you alright? - Hmmm. - Are you alright? Yeah. Why? You seem a bit lost. Uhm... It's... I'm fine. It's just... Uhm... Fudraiser at work has me worried about the kids. You kow what? I don't understand why you don't want me to help. And the thing is, if it comes to you and the things you care about, money is not a problem. So, let me help. Please. I do't want to bother you. I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's watch. Let's watch. Bianca.

Caramel is such a cutie. She's well grown and everything. I doubt she even remembers me. I thought you had moved passed all these. I mean, I offered to help but you said you had everything under control. Why didn't you want my help? You know what? Yeah. Here you go. Habib, you didn't have to. My contribution to the orphanage? Marry me? Please. What you did was ungodly. It is a sin. I'm sorry mama. First, it was your friend and his... Look, I kow you meant well but you did it I a ungodly way. Mama, I...

Don't be surprised. I mean, we literally tell ourselves everything. Yeah. She has agreed to marry me by the way. Why are you telling me this? I know you like her. I'm sure you are in love with her by now. I fell in love with her from the first day I saw her. So... Kindly respect the fact that she's mine now. Respect that. Yeah... What is this now? How come you don't have any alcohol in your house? Well, maybe it's because I don't drink alcohol. So... wait. All those while you went partying with your babe, you didn't drink right? Chiboy, what is it? What's up? Lanre got a promotion. How? He is the one that told them about the app. And how you got Z Capital to... ...fund you. Apparently, he said you stole it. That it was his idea. Wow! That doesn't even make any sense. But Mrs. Yemi is ready to buy every BS he is selling. See, that Lanre guy is such a slimey snake. He is... he is such a sneaky... Abel. Guy, what are you going to do now? What can I do? It's not like she will forgive me. You'll be here Forgive my French. Sorry. Listen Chiboy. I have something to tell you. Let me get a cup. I'm coming. Lanre is the one that almost raped Bianca. What did you say? Ufortuately, his face didn't appear in all those videos that tended online. So, there's no evidence to pin him down. I don't understand. Like Lanre... Lanre... like Lanre that works in the office. Our Lanre... You are serious. Lanre that doesn't talk. He acts like he doesn't notice girls. Remember that day. He was acting like he didn't see Bianca. Now the thing is... Who else...? He gives me the vibe of someone that has even tried it before. There's no point asking how you sleep at night because you clearly don't sleep. First of all, you steal my app and then you get me fired and like that's not enough, you almost raped Bianca. The least you can do is just apologize. Wait... wait... No! You'll look at me when I'm talking to you. You'll look at me whe I'm talking to you Lanre. Wow! So you expect me to apologize? For what exeactly? And as for that slut Bianca... Common bro, you should know better. Those kind of girls are not meant to be held unto. They are meant to be passed on. Please! Wait, is it Bianca... is it Bianca you are talking about like that? - Is it Bianca you are talking about? - Hey hey... No no... - What is going on here now? - Really... really...
