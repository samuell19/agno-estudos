Mom, I want cake. Okay dear. How are you going to eat if you're playing? Sit here. You came home without texting. Don't eat it that's for Angel. What? You bitch, why didn't you text me? I'm talking to you! We just got home. What? I just plugged in the phone. I need a drink. Joy... get me some gin. Are you deaf? I said get me some gin! You're already drunk! Where are you going? You're useless! You're making me angry, come here! Don't compare my drinking with you whoring around all night! Fucking slut! Dante, stop that! Shut up! Mind your own business! Go away! - Go away! - You're disturbing the neighbors! Come here you bitch! You're gonna stab me? Right here in my throat! Get out! Fuck! Angel! Damn you Dante! Look at what you did! Bitch, where are you going? Joy, fighting each other again? Help! What happened? My husband... Where's our service car? Out on an errand. We need to get her to the hospital. While waiting, let's do the blotter. Sit here. Joy, what happened to you? It's Dante... Again? Where's your husband? He's at home. Arnel, where are you? Do you read me? [Radio] Check out the situation. Copy Manong. Let's turn back. Men... We're responding to an alert. Alice... - ...Sir? - It's a VAWC case. Copy, sir. Who are we picking up? Dante Santos. Dante Santos? You know his address? Yes sir... He's at 14 Hilaga Street. Hey! No drinking on the street! All of you! Go home! Watch your step. Is this the Santos residence? Yes. George, go upstairs. No one's here, but there's drugs. In the bathroom as well... But that's not what we came here for. Anything? No one's here. He left already. Where is he? Maybe Kanluran Street?

They're at number 14. - Is this the house? - That's it. Good evening! Just a sec. Good evening, ma'am. We were told Dante Santos was here. Dante Santos? - May we come in? - Ma! Good evening, Madam! We were told Dante is here. We're inviting him to the district office to answer a complaint. - What do you... - I'm Alice from VAWC desk. We're here for your son because of an assault complaint filed by Joy Santos. What's VAWC? We are Office for Violence Against Women and Children. Men, search the house. Hey! You can't just enter my house! Ma'am, we have the right to search your house. Search upstairs! No one's here. There's another room! Don't you hurt my son! Handcuffs! Dante.

Don't worry. I'll call your uncle! Doc. - Yes, sir? - Doc, for medico-legal. - What happened? - Assault. Where did this happen? At Hilaga Street. Take his clothes off so I can examine him. Wait for a while. Antibiotics, three times a day. This one is for the pain. Thank you, where can I buy these? There's a drugstore outside. Clean the wounds every day. Thank you. Move here. Doc, he's wounded but it wasn't from us. Take your seat. - How about my cuffs, doc? - Just stay there. Any other wounds? Excuse me, ma'am? Here's the patient's consumption bill. Can I pay this later? Yes, ma'am. Joy Santos? Joy! My dear. You asshole! I'll kill you! Dad, stop it! You animal! I'm gonna kill him! Ma... I need to pay the bill now so I can bring Angel home. I won't take long. Here's the payment for my daughter's treatment. - Come again? - 460 pesos. For Dante Santos. Here's the temporary copy of the medical certificate. Come back next week for the original. I've already paid. Can I bring my child home? - Yes, you may. - Thank you. - Do you need this? - Yes. But we still prefer the original for documentation. Momma, don't leave me! Joy, we can't go with you. Your mother's not feeling well. It's okay. Come home to us after you're done, okay? Yes, ma. Sit down, Joy. Where's her medico-legal? Here. What's your decision, Joy? Send him to jail. Are you sure? Yes, I am. Do you have anything to say? This is your last chance. Joy... Why don't you talk it over first? I don't want to. I don't mean to pry, but what about your child? Look at what happened to Angel. Jail him! Don't make hasty decisions. Things will go well if you talk about it properly. Joy... Just talk. - Joy, let's talk. - Stay away. Please... C'mon, please... Fucking bitch! Get away from me! You selfish bitch! Get him out! So it's final? Do you want to add anything else to your blotter before you sign? - Nothing. - Can you sign now? Yes. Manong, it's 5 a.m., I'm off duty. - Who's going to escort her? - Ryan can do it. I'll just sign it and Ryan will proxy. Ryan take over. Bring her to VAWC. Alice? Where's Alice? - Thank you. - No problem. Follow me. Your full name? Joy⁠... Jona Faye R. Santos - Age? - 32. Name of your daughter? Angel. How old is she? 6 years old. Do you have a job? None, ma'am. Your husband's full name? Dante Santos, ma'am. - Are you two married? - Yes, ma'am. Are you pursuing the case? Yes, ma'am. The complainant has decided. There's nothing more we can do. She won't reconcile. - Where's the medical record? - Here, ma'am. Madame, kindly fill out the form and state necessary information. Write your name, address... And occupation. Down here write your husband's information too. At the back, write what your husband did to you. Date, place and time. - Where did it happen? - At our home. - Where do you live? - 14 Hilaga Street. - Here in Mandaluyong, correct? - Yes, ma'am. Okay, just fill that out. - Ma'am, I'll process him. - Go ahead. Name? Dante Santos. - Louder! - Dante Santos, ma'am. - How old are you? - 36, ma'am. Let's start now. What caused the fight? It was last night. Louder, I can't hear. It was afternoon when my mother invited us for dinner around 8 p.m. I texted Dante, he said he wanted to join. - But he was still out. - And then? It was getting dark, Angel was done playing and we were still waiting for Dante to come home. Since it was getting late, we went ahead without him. I still kept calling Dante to remind him that this dinner is my father's birthday treat. He never answered. It was quarter to 10 p.m. when we came back home. Dante arrived shortly after. Then, he started yelling⁠... Accusing me of leaving him behind without him knowing. Why wouldn't I be angry? You're cheating on me! Quiet! Then he started beating me in front of our daughter. What kind of father is that? You were assaulted, and then? It happened so fast. I noticed Angel was crying and her head was bleeding. Why don't you tell them you stabbed me? - She assaulted me! - Quiet! - Can I have my phone call? - Take your seat! That slut wanted to kill me. You're just selling drama! Calm down! - Want me to raise your charges? - No, ma'am. Put his handcuffs back! Please, I'd like to call my mother. I'm in danger. Keep quiet! Stand up and point at him. Look here. Once more. Let's take photos of your injuries. Where else? - May I sit? - Yes. Look this way. Joy, sign this first. You, come here. Sign this. Angel... I've transferred your statement here, for future references. Name and signature. Where's the arresting officer? Signature over your name. Escort her. Send the suspect ahead, let the arresting officers watch over him. Angel, mommy's putting daddy in jail! Move! Sir, where do I sign? Complete your requirements, then come back. Ma'am, for inquest proceedings. Fall in line. Where's Joy Santos? Excuse me? Joy Santos. Wait a sec. Go to Jerome at the side. Okay, ma'am. - Sir Jerome? - Yes, ma'am? We need your assistance. Ma'am, this was already cleared. Garcia, Gonzales, follow me. Ma'am, join us. Numbers one to five, be ready! Give way, please! Ma'am, stop. You can't cut in line. We're not here for the hearing. We're going to the prosecutor's office. Okay. Is everybody present? Joy Santos as complainant? - Here, prosecutor. - Take your seat. Excuse me Joy. Officer please... Kids are not allowed in these kind of proceedings. We will study the case, if there is probable cause then we'll go to court, then we'll have the hearing. Can he go to prison now? - Yes, but... - Why don't you imprison yourself? Everybody listen! I have many things to do please cooperate! If you want to resolve this quick... You get the justice you want, and start the process for you. Listen Dante, you shut up for a while, okay? We're still on the inquest proceedings stage. We don't know yet if there's probable cause. So when it comes to right... You have rights as a victim, likewise he has rights as the accused. If this is accepted in court, we'll be representing you as your lawyer. Dante, you can look for your own lawyer or are you going to use the Public Attorney's Office? - We have an attorney. - That's good. As for you Joy, you should be certain of what you want because if you want to pursue this, we'll swear in your statement then we can proceed. - Are we clear? - Yes. Can you stand? Raise your right hand. Do you swear that everything in your account is true? Yes. - Have you read everything? - Yes, ma'am. Is this your signature above the name Joy Santos? Yes, prosecutor. You know if you are lying, it can be used against you. Do you understand? - Yes. - Okay you can sit. Turn sideways. Fix your shoulder. - Madam please leave. - Officer, I won't stay long! Ma, please talk to Joy. Officer please, I need to talk to him. He's inside anyway. - Okay madam, but do it quickly. - Thank you. Ma, don't leave me here. You idiot! You're so stupid! You never do anything good. You're like your father! I'm sick of you! I can leave you here until you rot. You always give me problems! Brother, you won't starve here anyway. - Is it true? - You beat up Joy? I hit her lightly... Lightly? Her face is swollen! She stabbed me! But still... Ma... Your uncle doesn't want to help you. He just referred us a lawyer! Is he good? I don't want to stay here. Why don't you just plead guilty? Anyway that's the truth. You're up against a strong case. Ma, I'm sorry... Fix yourself! Shame on you! Madam, your time's up. Okay. - Okay. Thank you. - Ma, wait a sec! - Brother, take care. - Denise, bring me clothes. Madam, you can go home now. I'm sick of you, you always complain! Don't make a scene, give me back my son. Ma... It's hard to find your medicine. - What took you so long? - It was traffic! Mrs. Santos? You may go in. Okay, thank you. - Where is the room? - Wait, follow me. - You want me to carry your bag? - No, I'm fine. - Attorney! - Madam! How are you? - We're good. - I'm Denise. Please take your seats. I'll just finish this one. I'll settle the others later. Madam, how are you doing? Do you want water or biscuits? Anything will do. Get us some biscuits. - How about these? - Oh, I have high blood pressure. - Wouldn't it get better with wine? - It's risky. What can I do for you, madam? Attorney, I just want to know the progress of my son's case. I just need to talk to Dante. But Dante is still in jail. That won't be a problem. If he's in jail because of VAWC, the offense is bailable. Meaning... The court can allow Dante out of jail if he posts bail. If we pay the bail... - He's immediately released? - Correct. The court will give a list of requirements. You comply, post bail then get the receipt, show it to the judge. Then he issues a release order. Only then, Dante is freed from jail. He will remain free as long as he follows court orders. He just needs to attend court hearings. He just have to attend. Because if he does not cooperate he'll be sent back to jail. How much is the bail? Last time I remember it was around 12,000. But don't worry, it will be returned to you after the case. Is there a way to lower the amount? It's possible madam, we just have to file a motion to reduce bail. But that would take time. If we want Dante's immediate release, we should just comply. It will be given back to you anyway. Okay, we'll do something about it. Attorney, what about the acceptance fee? Perhaps we can ask for a discount. - Our engagement? - Yes, Attorney. Madam, I'll be frank. Your brother, Captain Sisson is a friend. I'm willing to give a discount. In cases like this, usually my acceptance fee is 40,000. But I can give you a more affordable price. From 40,000... I'll give it to you for 35,000. And my appearance fee... 5,000. And the submissions of motions and pleadings, 2,500 to 5,000 depending on the difficulty of the biddings. Attorney, I don't think that's affordable. Attorney, I'll be honest with you. To tell you the truth, I don't have a job. We have a small business, a tiny gambling den but the income is not enough. You are our only hope. Okay... Let's bring it down to 30,000. Would you manage? Also, this is confidential. Or else, others might also ask for discount. - 30,000 okay? - Yes, that would help a lot. Thank you very much. In that case... Pauline! Where's the memorandum of agreement? Here, attorney. Madam, I have a document for you. This is the engagement proposal of the law office, which you have to sign, agreeing to everything we talked about. This is about the prices, fees, and costs. Also, included is the extent of my services, like if I need to withdraw, you're giving me permission. Will you sign it? Sure. Sign here, madam. We're here, attorney. Okay, thank you. Ma, it's almost your turn. Hey, fall in line. That's my mother. We've been here for so long. Next! - Do I settle this here? - Yes, ma'am. 12,520. - Where did all this come from? - I worked hard for it. You're pretty good at saving. This will take time. Please wait. Madam, you can proceed upstairs. Thank you. Next! Sir, Dante Santos posted bail. Here's the release order. Keep an eye here for a while. It's your lucky day. Pack up your things! - Brother, visit my wife. - Bro, we will miss you. Visit us here! Don't you want to stay? Goodbye brothers! Make sure to come back, okay? Madam, can you please sign? This will certify that Dante is already under your custody. You should freshen up. We'll meet with the attorney afterwards. - Ma, he's gotten so thin. - Let's eat! Anybody home? - Yes? - Does Joy Santos live here? - Yes, why? - A letter for her. Thank you. Isabel, are the soaps ready? You're early! Come. Joy's packing them. - Joy! - Up here! Mario's here. Are you done? - Joy? - I'm here. Hurry up! Wait a sec. - He came too early. - I haven't finished the other box. I'm sorry, I didn't meet the quota. That's okay. I'll just deduct 500 bucks. Okay, thanks. - I'll wait for your next order. - Okay. Thank you. Joy, a letter from the court. Ma, I have to see the prosecutor. - Eat first. - I'm good. I'll just get some news. Indicated in the letter is the monthly support which you should follow regularly is that clear? - Everything's settled between you, okay? - Thank you, ma'am! Joy. Good afternoon. Take a seat. I'll just go get some water. - How are you? - I'm fine. I just want to know the progress of the case. Well... Didn't I tell you that we need witnesses that we can present. My parents are willing to become witnesses. Only them? They'll do. But... their testimonies will be weak because it will be self-serving. What does that mean? Of course, they're your mother and father. Whatever they say will be in your favor. Hence, the probative value is weak. What I suggest is someone who might have heard or at least seen you get beat up? That'll be a very strong witness. There's one. - My neighbor. - That would be better! Talk to her. Plead with her to help you with the case. Sit down... Get the folder. People versus Dante Santos. For the documents, I need the original as evidence. Facts don't lie. That will be our edge. Get your marriage contract. Also the medical certificate. Will the marriage certificate do? I don't think so. It won't work in your favor. It will work in Joy's favor. Tell me, just between us. I need the truth. What happened? Why did you beat her up? I got fed up. I work my ass off while she always roams and texts outside. She doesn't care about me. How do you put up with that? When it happened, did anyone see you? I think so. But they don't care at all. But we still need to talk to them. Otherwise, Joy will take them as her witnesses. Talk to them, and convince them to side with us. I'll try. You told me before that Joy also assaulted you. - Yup. - How? She tried to kill me with a knife. Well, we can use that! Perfect for self-defense! We'll show to the court that she hates you. She wanted to kill you so she stabbed you. Of course, you had to defend yourself. So you kicked her, hit her, beat her up. About your arguments, are there any texts from her? - Inbox? - Yes. I'll check my phone. That could help. We also need people to corroborate. Do you know anybody who can testify for you? I'll look around the neighborhood. Look wisely. We need three witnesses, including you. What I'll do is... I'll prepare and draft the story, the questions, and answers. All you need to do... is to fully understand them. Better yet, memorize them so we won't fail. - Understood? - Okay, attorney. Excuse me, original copy of medical certificate, please. Identification? One second. Thank you. Doc! I was the one you treated two months ago. My husband beat me up, remember? Why? I was hoping... if you could testify for me in court against my husband. I'm loaded with work but let me see my schedule. - Hey! - What the fuck! Come down! Fight me! Fucking asshole! That asshole nearly ran me over. - Is boss inside? - Yes. Bro! - Where's boss? - Over here. Alright. Boss? - What's up? - Just got freed. My fucking wife went wild. When are you going to work? I'll fix my case with Joy first. Boss, I'd like to take my part from the last project. - What project? - The motorcycle. Just a sec. - Wow, that looks nice! - Sure it does. - Are those parts from the last project? - Yes! But they're worn out. That's fine. Look at this beauty. Fuck, your taste is awful. This is not aluminum it's just plastic! There's another project tonight. I'll pass this time, boss. I'll fix my case first. Boss, how about this... - Boss? - What? Perhaps you can testify at my hearing? I need your help. Just tell me when. That's a promise? Sure. I knew you'd say yes. Thanks, boss. - Joy, what's up? - Rudy. Is Stella in? She's not in. Why? I need help with my case. She went out. I'll call you when she comes back. Or you can come back later. - Okay, thanks. - Sure. Rudy? Rudy? - Dante! - Let's go. What's up? - Let's drink. - Alright. You're already drunk. Fuck that! Drink with me. - What? - Stella. I need your help. Can you testify at my hearing? You were there when the fight happened. Joy, that's impossible. I'll get in trouble with Rudy. I want nothing of it. Please, Stella. No, Joy. My husband will get mad at me. I'm sorry. Where is the text? Stupid bitch! - Fix the wires on the trees. - Yes, Capt. Uncle! You, next. Okay, do it now. What's up? I just got released. How's the lawyer? He's a great help, but too expensive. But he gets the job done. Uncle, just one last favor. Can you testify at my hearing? What for? I need credible witness... Excuse me, captain your patrol's ready. Okay. Uncle? Please. Go ahead. Wait for me downstairs. You again? Hell, you're practically living here. Fix yourself! Uncle, you know I'm innocent. If you plead guilty, you'll get a lighter sentence. I didn't do anything. What do you mean lighter sentence? I mean, your jail time will be shortened. For example, three years will be one year. I won't last a week, how much more a year? I won't survive in jail. The whole district knows what you did. I can't lie on your behalf. I have a reputation to protect. Captain! Hey! You've grown. - Say hi to your mom. - I will, captain. - Uncle, I'll wait for you. - I'm gonna be late. Manong? What? I just met with Uncle, but he's busy. Maybe you can testify on my hearing. - When? - In a few days. Don't touch my food! Hands off my water. What's the deal? Testify for me in the hearing. Everything you'll say will be given to you, on paper. How long will it be? Just a short one! Let's see. Can you please leave? I'm losing my appetite. Okay. Thank you. Madam, wait a sec. Where are you going? We live across. Apologies, but the road is closed because there's a crime scene here. If you can, please find another way home. ...effective channels of truth, justice and peace In our proceedings today, guide us in the path of righteousness for the fulfillment of Your greater glory.

Proceed with the trial. Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Witness, when you were asked of your personal circumstances you said that you're a medical custodian? - Yes, ma'am. - Of what hospital? Mandaluyong Hospital, ma'am. Do you have the medical certificates and other records? Here, ma'am. Witness producing records of Joy Santos, Your Honor. The medical certificate Your Honor, was previously marked as Exhibit D for the prosecution and I'm requesting that other records Your Honor be submarked as Exhibit D-1, D-2, and D-3. Any objection? No objection, Your Honor. Your Honor, cross-examination. - Go ahead. Proceed. - Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Witness... You mentioned that you're the custodian of medical records. Is that correct? Yes, sir. Being a custodian, does it require you to have a medical background? No, sir. - So you're not a doctor. - No. You never took medical courses back in college? No, sir. In other words, whatever's contained in that medical certificate the technical medical description, the abstract... You wouldn't know anything about it. No, sir. Were you the person who examined Mrs. Joy... No, sir, I didn't see her. So you don't have personal knowledge as to the narration included in that medical certificate? - None sir. - I only write records. You don't know anything about it? None. - You've never met this person? - No, sir. That's all, Your Honor. No more questions. Have you seen Aiza? She already punched out. Attorney! Do I have to attend the next hearing? You need to show your eagerness to prove that their accusations are wrong. But it's boring inside. It's necessary! Trust me. Attorney! Here's the payment for the hearing earlier. - Is this exact? - Yes, the total amount. - Okay. Just get the receipt at my office. - Yes, attorney. I'll go ahead. I still have a date. Take care, attorney. - You'll show up in court, okay? - Yes, attorney. So I need to attend every time? What happened inside? I looked like an idiot, I couldn't understand a thing. I just signed some papers. From the guy over there. Don't mind him. All those who have a number, please fall in line! Joy! Where's your witness? Here, prosecutor. - Did you bring the document? - Yes, ma'am. - Ma'am, can I remove my vest? - No, just wear it. Have you memorized your testimonies? Yes, ma'am. Relax, okay? I'm sorry, but shorts are prohibited inside the court... It's not a short? - It can't be seen if I sit down! - Sir, I'm just following orders. You really aren't allowed to enter in your shorts... What will happen in my hearing? - I'm sorry. - Please, bro. Where's your mother? She should be here already. Attorney, you didn't tell me that shorts are not allowed. That's common sense. Where exactly is she? See if this fits you. Where did you get it? From the thrift shop. - I might get a rash. - Don't complain! Hurry up! Mr. Witness, on the night while you were on duty at the district office on June 23, 2016, do you remember anyone asking for your help? It was Joy. Had she asked for help in the past? Yes, she frequently complains at the district office. After receiving her complaint that night, what did you do next? We went to the place of incident to arrest Dante. - Arrest? - Yes, ma'am. Regarding that arrest. Do you remember doing an affidavit of arrest? Yes, ma'am. I have here a document. What is your relation to this? That is the affidavit of arrest. How can you say that? It has my signature below. - Can you point at it? - Here. - Above your name Ryan? - Yes, ma'am. Your Honor, may I request that this document be marked as exhibit B for the prosecution and the signature on top of the typewritten name Ryan Pamintuan be marked as Exhibit B-1. Mark it. Any cross? Yes, Your Honor. - Cross for the defense. - Proceed. Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Witness how long have you been a district officer? - 10 years, sir. - 10 years? Yes, it runs in the family. If you're doing an arrest, do you need a warrant or not? It depends. There are times that it is really needed. But there are instances where we make warrantless arrests. When you arrested Dante, was there a warrant or not? None. When can you arrest without a warrant? On what grounds? I know of three circumstances. What are those? First applies to an escaped convict. We don't need a warrant anymore. That's the first. The second? If a crime has just been committed, and I have personal knowledge of the suspect, we can make the warrantless arrest. The third circumstance? If the person is caught red-handed, meaning if he has a deadly weapon and has an intent to kill, we make the arrest even without a warrant. About the case of an escaped convict. My question is: is Dante a prisoner? - No. - So you can't arrest him on the spot. No, sir. Without a warrant of arrest. Secondly. Do you have personal knowledge of Dante, allegedly assaulting his wife? - None. - None as well? Thirdly, were you there when the alleged assault was happening? Did you see Dante making the assault? - No, sir. - No, as well? In short... what happened that night does not qualify as a warrantless arrest. Is that correct? Yes. Based on your 10 years experience as a district guard, what happens in an unwarranted arrest, which does not fall in any of the three circumstances? The arrest can be... declared null and void. And a case can be filed against you, right? Both administrative and criminal. Your Honor, I'm presenting to the witness a document which is the blotter report, previously pre-marked as defense Exhibit No. 3 to the witness. Mr. Witness, look at the bottom. Who arrested Dante? What's the name? - Arnel de la Cruz. - Arnel de la Cruz? - Yes. - What's your name? Ryan Pamintuan. So it's not you who made the arrest. - No, but he was with me... - Stop there, Mr. Witness. - We even accompanied Joy. - Mr. Witness, please. Your Honor, may I caution the counsel... Not to badger the witness, Your Honor. - Counsel, - Your Honor, no more questions. Ma, where are you going? I'll be gone for a while, baby. Want me to help you? Okay. Are you an expert at this? I know all about that! Is that necessary? How do I look? What's this? We don't look alike anymore. Yes, we do. Counsel, you may proceed. Yes, Your Honor. Joy, why do you think Dante... Your Honor, I object, it calls for an opinion. The witness is incompetent to testify based on the internal workings of the mind of the accused, Your Honor. Sustained. Prosecutor, rephrase your question. In your recollection, what was the reason behind your fight that lead to his physical abuse? I can't remember any reason. I think his brain's damaged because of meth use... Your Honor. I'm sorry but we also have to object It's non-responsive to the question. As a matter of fact, we shall move to strike that meth portion off the record for being derogatory in nature. Sustained. How often does it take place? Many times. Every time he gets drunk, he becomes a devil. How can you tell if he's drunk? Last time, he beat me up with his hands. He was very close that I could smell his breath and see his red eyes. From this experience, how did the battering affect your personhood as a woman? Frustrated. I didn't expect him to love me, but at least there should be respect. I think even my death won't change him. From all the things that have happened, what do you ask from this court? Justice. No more questions, Your Honor. Counsel. Your Honor, cross. Proceed. Thank you, Your Honor. Madam Witness, your accusations against Dante, your husband. With all these alleged beatings, a serious matter that should've been reported to the police. How many times did you report? - Only now. - Just once? Madam Witness, have you physically hurt Dante? But that's because... - Yes or no? - Yes. But that's because I get carried away by the situation. Especially when he hurts me. So there are times you do things you don't really mean to? Yes. Did you come to a point that because of extreme anger that you can kill? Your Honor, I have with me a photograph or the copy of a text message sent by Joy to my client, the accused Dante which happened before the alleged date when they allegedly had a fight. Madam Witness, can you please read the text message you sent to Dante? What? Please read the text message you sent to Dante. - "Don't ever try to come... - Louder, please. "Don't ever try to come home, or I'll kill you, bastard!" But... Your Honor, no more questions. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, Madam Witness. Witness is excused. Madam Prosecutor! Joy... I prepared some questions and things you have to remember. Practice it with Angel. Guide her. Isn't this a lot for a kid... Just remember the important details like the dates. The major points. So you won't get mixed up. Okay, ma'am. It's better that we're prepared. Thank you. Vangie, Ynah I'll go ahead. - Okay Joy. - Goodbye! Ma, this is a lot. Have we been called already? Yes, prosecutor. Take a seat first. Next case! Judge, we can go back to number 40, prosecutor's here. Where is she? Present, Your Honor. Why are you late? I'm sorry, Your Honor. Our village was flooded. Cars can't pass through, sorry. Okay, proceed. Who's your next witness? Angel. She's sick, although she can do it. Your Honor, I have a witness, the daughter of the private complainant, Angel Rosario Santos, Your Honor, but considering that Angel is a child witness, may I request that the hearing be conducted in the chamber. Okay, let's proceed to the chamber. We'll go inside the judge's office. Do you believe in Jesus, Angel? Yes. What happens to a child when she's bad? She goes to hell. Do you want to go to hell? So tell the truth when we ask you, okay? I'll ask you, together with the attorney and the judge, okay? So you have to tell the truth. Alright. Isn't that... Do you stay with mommy and daddy? Yes. When they allegedly fight, will you be able to tell how it started? What did daddy do? If there is. For the record, Your Honor, the witness is demonstrating a clenched fist in a punching position. Is daddy inside this room? Yes. So he is here. Can you get down first, look around this room and point where daddy is. Can you find him? That's all for the Witness, Your Honor. Your Honor, subject to cross. Proceed. Thank you, Your Honor. Angel... I'll also ask questions, okay? Do you know why you're here? When prosecutor asked earlier, you said that mommy and daddy were fighting, right? Yes. So you're here because they were fighting? Yes. Do you like it when they fight? No, I don't. Your Honor, may we place it on record that the witness is shaking her head in response to the question. Why don't you like it when mommy and daddy fight? Do you know that your mother, wants your father imprisoned? No. Do you want that to happen? You'll lose dad? - No. - Your Honor, may I ask the counsel to be gentle with his questions? Counsel, please... ...please be gentle with the child. Understood, Your Honor. Angel, again do you want your father in jail? No. I don't want to. Your Honor, again we manifest the witness is shaking her head indicating that she doesn't want her father imprisoned. Angel, last question. Have you seen your mother aim a knife at your father? I'll repeat. Have you seen your mommy aim a knife at your daddy? Yes. That's all, Your Honor, no more questions. You can sign there. We're done. Angel come, let's go home. Letter for Elsa Santos! Please sign. Thank you. Ma. What? Letter for you. From? Don't place it there! Look! It's wet! I'll go ahead, ma! Wait. What's the meaning of this? Your balance from the attorney. What? Where's your brother? At work. Come with me. - I'm on my way to work. - No, you'll come with me. Ma, I can't. Why me? Where's the money? Here it is. But my boss only gave me half. Why is that? I don't know. - You're really useless. - Ma'am, excuse me... Ma'am, can you bring that outside? We still have clients. Am I not a client? Here! This is half the amount, I'll give the rest tomorrow. We can't accept that, ma'am. This is still payment! Ma'am, we've talked about this already. It should be in full amount. But this is better than nothing. - Please take it! - Ma'am, let's just follow the policy. C'mon, we've been paying you bit by bit. Ma'am, I'm sorry but you really need to pay the full amount. We're out of cash because of you. All our money goes into this goddamn office! You have no consideration! Ma'am, If you insist I'll call security. Then call security! C'mon! You'll tell them we're not paying? - Useless clerks! - Ma, stop it! Criminal Case MC 16-2948-FC. People of the Philippines vs. Dante Santos y Sisson for violation of Republic Act 9262. For the government ready, Your Honor. Where's the accused? He's not around, Your Honor. What do you mean he's not around? Your Honor! Where's your lawyer? He's gone, Your Honor. What do you mean? We can't pay him anymore. Can anyone from the Public Attorney's Office handle this case? Atty. Cruz? Yes, Your Honor. I will give you enough time to assess and confer with the accused and determine whether he is qualified to avail the services of the Public Attorney's Office. Yes, Your Honor. Set the continuation on December 4, 2017. - Attorney we didn't know... - Let's talk outside. Our former lawyer has no mercy. We paid him a lot. Just because we can't pay anymore, he ditched us. How about you? How does it work in your office? P.A.O. services are free. Just prove that you can't afford to pay for a lawyer. I have here some documents. Read carefully. Gather these requirements, but the most important one is the Certificate of Indigency. Where do I get it? From your district office... - Attorney! - What's up? Let's eat out later. Okay. I'll wait for you here. - I'll just finish this client meeting. - Sure. Wouldn't the indigency certificate affect our case in such a way that he will lose dependability as a father? I don't think so, because this is not about Angel's custody. The issue here is if... Dante will be granted parole. I need these documents before the next hearing, okay? I need to submit those to the judge. From the district office, right? Yes. Let's meet before the hearing. Another thing, don't forget to bring your witnesses. I need to talk to them... - Attorney, Good afternoon! - Hello! Everything's good! Dante, get the attorney's number. I'll get your number instead. Write it here. Why don't you buy your own typewriter? Why didn't you wear your uniform today? At least I have a vest. How about your payslip? No problem. It's easy to fake it. Bring it here for the records. Okay, I'll go ahead. - Be a good civilian. - I already am! I'll take four. Surprise! What are you doing? We'll just walk around. No, you can't! Stop! We'll not go far. Baby, what do you want? - How much? - 130 bucks. I'll get this. Give me discount please. Could someone help me? He took my granddaughter. - Please! - Where? Over there. What else do you want? Come on. You like this one too? What else? That hat is nice. Angel! Come to me. - Angel keep the toys! - Madam, you're wasting our time. Officer, he took her by force... - How much do I owe you? - 100. Angel! Bye bye! Okay, Madam Prosecutor. Joy, you're early! - Yes, ma'am. - The hearing is after lunch. What's the matter? Any problems? I'm just scared of Dante and what he could do to me and Angel. Why? Something happened? Nothing... Then why do you feel that way? Has he done something to you? Mother's instinct. You're afraid. Walk with me. We can file a Permanent or Temporary Protection Order in court. What's that? It means he can't come near you or come to your house. But it's not certain if the court will grant that unless, he did something to you or Angel that will put you in danger. What's your designation at the District office? Desk officer, sir. From your statement, Dante is a volunteer in your district. What programs did he participate in? There's a lot, such as a feeding program, dental and medical missions. He helped in our campaign against illegal drugs, and he coordinates basketball tournaments. In your dealings with Dante, did you notice anything different from his actions... Objection, Your Honor. The question is irrelevant with the present action. Overruled. Hold on. Who keeps on coughing there? The man beside me, Your Honor. - Is he sick? - Yes, Your Honor. Tuberculosis. But he's been released from the hospital. - What's his case number? - 33. We're still at case number 24. Get him out. He might spread disease. Yes, Your Honor. Give your number to the marshal. He'll be called. Atty. Cruz, please proceed. What about Dante's record in your District? Did your district have problems with Dante? None, in fact, he's really cheerful and active. He knows how to treat others well. That's why he has many friends. No more further questions, Your Honor. Prosecutor, your Witness. Sir. You swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, in this court. - Do you remember? - Yes, ma'am. If so... Do you remember any blotter that has been recorded, on June 23, 2016? Yes, I do. I have here a document, please take a look. Is this the blotter that you remember on June 23, 2016? Yes, ma'am. It was signed by Manuel Garcia. - Are you familiar with that name? - That's me. Based on this blotter, - who is the one complaining? - Joy Santos. Joy Santos you say. And who is the one being complained? - Dante Santos. - Very well. Can you tell this court what the complaint was about? Dante is beating up Joy then Joy asks for protection from the District office. So she asked for help. Therefore, are you saying that the District, had problems with Dante? Yes, ma'am. - That's clear. - Yes. You said earlier that Dante has no record in your District office contrary to what you have just said and written on this blotter, isn't this proof that Dante had problems with the District office? Yes, ma'am. So is it clear that you are telling a lie? Objection, Your Honor! The prosecutor is argumentative and is berating the witness. Rephrase your question. I'm sorry, Your Honor. I withdraw the question. I have made my point, that's all for the witness. Erlinda! Help me, my attorney forgot to read this for me. I don't know where to find him. It says guilty. You won. - You finally won! - Thank God! It's time to celebrate! Take care! She's lucky. Please stand. Raise your right hand while left hand on the Bible. Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? Yes. You may sit. Name? Dante Santos. - Age? - 34. - Occupation? - Mechanic. - Address? - 14 Kanluran Street. Counsel. Mr. Witness. - Attorney. - Dante. The day when Joy was allegedly beaten, where were you? At home. What were you and Joy doing? What caused the argument? It happened on the night of June 22, 2016. I wanted to treat my wife and daughter, but they chose to be at my in-law's house because it was her father's birthday. She didn't bother to take notice of my effort. She said it was just a waste of money. How did you feel? Of course I got insulted. I saved money for that dinner. So you got hurt? Objection, Your Honor. Leading. Sustained. Rephrase your question. Let me rephrase Your Honor. What happened next? If there is. And then, I was supposed to go after them but it rained, so I went to my friend's house. That's when I received a message from Joy. When the rain stopped, what happened next? If there is. I received the text. "Don't ever try to get home, or I'll kill you, bastard! But I still went home. What happened when you got home? Joy and Angel were there. Then Joy suddenly threw things at me. Like what? She threw plates until I was bleeding from the cuts. So she threw plates, what happened after? I was trying to stop her. I went to her and embraced her, but she suddenly got a knife and slashed me in the arm. Can you point at the scar? Here. Your Honor, let it be put on record that the accused is pointing to his left arm, Your Honor. There are lacerations, around 5 inches, Your Honor. Proceed. What happened next, after she cut you? I noticed my daughter's head was bleeding. I think when she was throwing plates at me, she might also have wounded my daughter's head. Mr. Witness, how would you describe your relationship with Joy's family? From the start, her family never liked me. This never became a reason for you to leave Joy? No, because I love Joy and my daughter so much. You really love Joy? Even if she hurts you? Even if she cut you? You still love her? We have a child. No further questions, Your Honor. Prosecutor. Dante Santos? Yes. That night, before you and Joy got into a fight... ...did you drink? A little. Alcohol? Yes because, I was waiting for the rain to stop. My friend and I drank a little. So you're saying you're intoxicated when you got home? No. I did drink but I wasn't intoxicated. You weren't intoxicated? Yes. Your argument escalated into a physical fight. Correct? Yes. You hurt her. Correct? I defended myself... Just yes or no, Dante. Just answer yes or no. Yes. Very well. And this was not the first time you physically hurt Joy? Correct? Yes. Dante, let me ask you, do you love your wife? That was already answered, Your Honor. Sustained. You said earlier during direct examination that you love Joy so much. Correct? I love my daughter. What about Joy? I love her too. And because you love Joy, do you have the right to hurt her? Answer. Yes or no? Maybe. Mr. Witness, just answer yes or no. Do you have the right to hurt Joy? Just because you love her? Is that a license for you to hurt your wife? Answer me. Yes or no? Yes. That's all for the witness, Your Honor. No redirect, Your Honor. No more witnesses? Your Honor, may we request from this honorable court, to issue a subpoena to Angel Santos. I need to object, Your Honor. That witness already testified. The fucker's taking too long. Let's go. The boss wants it fast. Where's the money? How much is this? The exact amount. Hurry! Your Honor, today is the last day of the period given to the prosecution to file its comment opposition to the formal offer of evidence filed by the defense. In the higher interest of justice, Your Honor, may we request for... extension of time to find the said comment opposition? Any objection, Counsel? We interpose none, Your Honor. Where's the accused? To be candid with the court, Your Honor, the last time I talked to the accused was during the last hearing. I've been trying to communicate with him but I've not been receiving any response, I don't know where he is, Your Honor. How many days, Counsel? I can finish that in five days, Your Honor. Okay. Call the next case. What if the accused is absent from the hearing? You mean Dante? When he didn't appear in court earlier? It will not affect our case. I just requested an extension to file our opposition. Everything is done. We're just waiting for the court's decision. Do you have any idea what the decision will be? Of course it's all up to the judge. Everything's equal. But if you ask me, of course we will win. Justice is on our side. Do my nails later. Yeah, sure. Isabel, have you seen my brother? No. But he said he's going here. Are you sure? Yes. Is there a problem? Joy! Where's Dante? I don't know. Where did he go? I'll go ahead. What did she want? Nonsense. Deal it. Kenneth, have you seen Dante? No. You sure? No. Haven't seen him. He said he'd be at Joy's but he hasn't been there. If he's there, why ask me? I was just wondering if he passed by here. No. He hasn't. Do you know where he might have gone? Try at his workplace. He might be there. Okay. If he shows up, tell him to text me. Okay, I'll tell him. Thanks. Sir. Sir, excuse me. I'm Dante's mother. Did he report for work today? No. I don't know. He left several days ago, but he hasn't come back since. Maybe he passed by here. I didn't see him at work yesterday. How about today, is he in? I just got here. - Bro, have you seen Dante? - No, sir. I'm sorry but I really have no idea where he is. Do you know any friend whom I can ask? Anyone? Sorry I don't know anyone. Okay, thanks! Identification? That's not allowed. Sir, excuse me. Did you pick up someone named Dante Santos? Hold on. I'll get to you later. Sir, he's been missing for several days. Can you please help me? What's his name? Dante Santos. No record, ma'am. Can I at least have a look in your prison? He may have used a different name. Identification? I don't have it with me. Okay. I'll go with you, ma'am. Do you see him? No. What should I do? Have it blottered. I'll accompany you. Can I do it now? Yes, ma'am. Thanks, officer. Wait 'til I get back. Officer! Her son is missing. Thanks. MOTHER FATHER Okay children, today's topic is the duties of family members regardless of gender. Let's start. What are the duties of mothers? Elisha. Name one. Roshein! Laundry! Doing laundry, yes. How about you Angel? What does your father do? Just name one. I don't know. Louder. I don't know. Nothing?
