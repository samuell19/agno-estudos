Do you wish to die? You think I don't want to die? Let's jump together. Let's jump together. Boy. Are you on your way home? Back from prostrating all the way to Lhasa? Your heart is pure. You are so young. What else would you do? In my life, I thought about going, too. I was not very devoted in my youth. My body fails in old age. That's how it all came and went. Boy, take off your luggage. Let's stay here tonight. Hello? Hello? Is that you? Speak up. Is that you? Hello? Whose phone is it? It's annoying. Whose phone? Hello? Who is there? Hello? Mother will arrive tomorrow. She probably worried about our wedding and my sister-in-law giving birth. Oh. Sister-in-law, is brother picking up mother? I don't know. He left this morning. Still hasn't returned. Oh. Where are you going? To pick up mom. Be careful. OK. You are here. Didn't you tell me to come? I was worried you would forget. Your driving is getting better. A little better. You should still be careful. Give me one, too. Since when do you smoke? This time she stayed a while. Not so long. Almost a month now. It feels like a long time. Mother isn't used to the city. Hello. Dad, where are you? I am still on the way. You just left before the feast finished. My husband's family thought that you were not very happy. How could I be unhappy? I couldn't give you any help. It's better if I leave. Take care of yourself. Say something. Call me mum. I'll give you this. Mum. Mum. Mum gives this to you. Where are you going? The bus is about to leave. Boy! Boy! Where are you headed? I'll give you a ride. We can chat on the way. You don't need to pay. Boy! Is this the road to Xining? Where are you going? I can take you. No charge. Hi! Hi! Get on the bus. Aren't you heading home? Get inside. If you don't have money I'll pay for your ticket. Let's go. The bus travels too fast. I don't even know where I'm going. Too fast? You don't know where you're going? Aren't you going home? Well, I have to go. I didn't think you'd reach here by evening. I waited the whole day for you. I'll come along with you. Here, bread. I can't chew. I only have one tooth left. Eat. I'll gather some dung. It will be cold tonight. I need a rest. I am not young anymore. Come, sit over here. Smoke some tobacco. You don't know how. It's like this. Ha ha ha. You will just fart. That truck takes cargo to Lhasa. I know that one. That driver? I know most of these drivers. They give me food. You are so young. Why did you go on the pilgrimage to Lhasa? It's not important. Someone at home passed away. Not one of your parents? You are young. You definitely repaid your parents' kindness. What is with you? It's almost sundown. Have you gone mad? Everyone has parents. Everyone dies. You prostrated all the way to Lhasa. What more is there? You are old enough to understand. You have gone through enough. I only could forget everything by keeping walking. Mom, did you get carsick? No. How is the pregnancy? Good. Easy now. Take a rest here. You are tired. Mom, did you say you stayed in sister's home for a while? They had me look after the child. There was not even time to go out. Even the toilet is in the house. It is so uncomfortable. Everyone knows when you fart. Ah, ha ha ha. Looks like it will rain. We should get going. So quickly? Rest a little, then we'll go. No, it's fine. Let's carry on. Nyima, help out mother. I'll bring the motorcycle. Ah! Will it clear up tonight? I'm going to the toilet. Hello father, is that you? What is it? Nothing. Where are you? Still on the way. When will you arrive? I don't know yet. I'm busy now. I need to go. Do you have children? Just one girl. She just learned to say "father". Don't you miss your girl? Travelling here and everywhere. I miss her. At home she would drive me crazy. It has been so long on the road. I miss her a lot. I have two children. Now, they all have their own families. I went to Lhasa for my daughter's wedding. The groom does business in Lhasa. Good. And the mother? She passed away a while ago. Oh. Back then we saw to it that the children grew up. Then we saw to it that they started families. Now that the children are married, what is there to do? You will have the grandchildren to look out for. And after that? I don't know. Stop! Stop! I have seen him before. You know him? Sure I do. I always travel this road. He is really odd. He will not get in. Why? Has he finished prostrating already? He is kind of strange. Stop! Stop! You are not one to trust. You just left me there? Still enjoying the sun? You haven't even had breakfast. Are you sure you don't want to get in? Boy! Do you remember me? What is with you? Didn't you prostrate to Lhasa? Just get in! I'll tell you a love story. I have some funny stories to tell. Just listen. Once, a long, long time ago there was a boy living in a village. He would often go on a retreat to do practice after practice. All the village admired him. One day he saw an astonishingly beautiful girl in the village. He fell in love with her. And they got married. The villagers were very surprised. How could such a determined practitioner foolishly fall in love with a girl? So one of his friends thought to deceive him, and wrote on a yellow cloth: "on such and such an auspicious day, come to the meditation retreat and you will become enlightened." The boy thought it must be a prophecy. He waited and waited until the day of the new year. That day he put on new clothes and slowly went up the mountain. He remembered his wedding as he arrived and then thought: "It is too soon to obtain enlightenment. I should first get married, still enjoy this life for a little while and then become enlightened." He decided not to practice and turned back. Ha ha ha. Love is just that powerful. He clung to his wife, even on the brink of enlightenment. Some people just care about their own problems. They throw away their wife and move on. Some, like this boy, leave a virtuous girl behind. She falls lovesick and they don't even know it. Just as the fire of a prosperous household is wasting away. What a pity. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! How do you feel? Are you hungry? Is the rain over? It is sunny. How long have I been here? Three days. I'll call the doctor. Sister. Nyima. Shamba. Who are you looking for? Do you want something? Arrest me. What is this? What have you done? What is your village? You came by our house this morning. So you are Gyabo's brother. Don't think about it too much. Just go back. You finally remembered to wait. I had some tea made. I drank plenty myself. This is for you. Kid, let's get some tea for him. This is as far as my ride took me. Now you see that the sun burns? The sun strikes down from the west on the journey to Lhasa. Your cheek will blister. No use now, it's parched. If you look in the mirror you will not recognize yourself. That poor girl who is waiting for you would not even know it is you. Does he look like a mad man? He he he. Be honest, does he look mad? A little. Thank your father for me. That boy is so cute. Once you have children, they help you forget any kind of problem, push away any grief. We have a saying: This life may be transient but we still need to live and breathe in this world. but we still need to live and breathe in this world. We take on this human body, grow up, find a mate, have children, and at the end comes death. Saying this is harsh. I think this is life. It is enough. That poor girl waiting for you spoke on the phone. She will wait for the day of your return even if her eyes burst. Then she cried. Where else is there for you to go? Is there anything to think twice about? That in your bag - why are you taking it back with you? I tried already but I couldn't bear to leave it there. Your mom is too old. I am not pretty any more. I am already on the way to heaven. There is only a room with four beds. Is that all right? Fine. As long as it is cheap. Are you coming from Lhasa? Yes. How did you know? It's written in the boy's face. Girl! Come in here. Go away. Uncle, I locked my key inside. Could the boy come and jump through the window? Surely. Boy, go and help. You go ahead. He will follow. You are so weak. If I was young and this happened I would be so excited. Hello. Father. Where are you now? Do not worry. I am not a child. Why aren't you going home? Where are you? I will arrive tomorrow. Why is your phone always off? There is no need to waste money. My sister worried so much. Today, again, she kept calling nonstop. Tell her I am coming tomorrow. You call her. Just like a night owl! Sleep. Father, where have you gone? What is with this crying? I met a sworn brother on the way and made a stop. I will arrive tomorrow. Don't cry. Take good care of your family from now on. You have told me one hundred times. I will. Sleep now. We need to get up early. My last tooth fell out. Out of thirty, none are left. Now I am old. When I was small and had my milk teeth first a front tooth fell out. I ran and told my mother. She said, get up early, tie the tooth with wool and throw it over our tent saying "Uncle Sun, Uncle Sun, take this foul dog tooth, give me my conch-white tooth" and your new tooth will grow. Instead, in the morning I said, "Uncle Sun, Uncle Sun, take your conch-white tooth, give me a foul dog tooth." My mother heard this and laughed, shaking so hard. It has been so many years since she passed. But I still remember vividly her voice and her smile. Looking at this tooth now it is just like a dog's tooth. Will the tea boil before the bus comes? It seems the bus is coming. Hey! Hey! No, it's not. It is an enjoyment just drinking a cup of tea in such a barren place. The bus is coming! This is your uncle. Uncle! This is your uncle. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Come on - let's go home. Wait here.
