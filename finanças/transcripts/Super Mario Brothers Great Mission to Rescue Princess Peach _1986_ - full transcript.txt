Brought you some tea, Bro. Tea? Tea, tea... Good night, Mario. Help me! What the...? Hey, hey, hey! Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Are these your friends? No... doesn't seem like it. Hey! Cut it out! Cut it out already! Hello? Hello? - Help me! - Oh, I wasn't... Oh, my apologies. You really saved me there. Thank you. I am Princess Peach. Princess Peach... And you, Mario, are a very brave knight. Eh? N-No way... Is it all right if I hide here for a while, Mario? Sure, sure. Peach, sweetie... It's King Koopa! The boss of those monsters just now. He's a bad guy! He's made a mess of our kingdom. Make him go away! Please, Mario? Chase him away! Okay! G-G-Get back! Get back! Mario, get him! Beat him up! I know you can win! Hey, you! Come at me! He's scary! Hang in there, Mario. I'm sure you can defeat him. Guess I got no choice... - All right, come at me! Come on... - Go! Go! Ma-ri-o! Mario! You monster! Save me! - I've caught you, Peach, sweetie. - Let me go! Let me go! Ew! Save me, Mario! Wh-Where are you? Mario! Mario! Mario, save me! Oh no, this is bad! Mario! Save me! Huh? Hey, you! Get back out here! Hey! Get back here! - What's the matter? - Come on! Princess Peach has been kidnapped! Princess Peach? Who the heck is that? She came here asking me to save her. Save her? Princess Peach asked you? Go to sleep and you can dream what happens next. Seriously, though, just who was she? She sure was cute.

Please pardon my rudeness. You were summoned here to the Mushroom Kingdom... by none other than me! Mushroom Kingdom? Mushroom Kingdom... Did you say "Mushroom Kingdom?!" You mean the Mushroom Kingdom also known as the Land of Treasure?! Hey! We're gonna be... super rich! Multimillionaires! Hey! You see, the Koopa Clan in a neighboring kingdom has this great evil king, Koopa... Koopa! Koopa! He's a big villain! Koopa! Koopa! Oh, so cool! He's still bitter because Princess Peach turned down his marriage proposal, and has taken it out on our kingdom by trashing it and kidnapping Princess Peach! Trashing, trashing! Trashing, trashing! Princess Peach has been kidnapped! Trashing, trashing! Trashing, trashing! Princess Peach has been kidnapped! - Trashing, trashing! Trashing, trashing! - Princess Peach... Princess Peach has been kidnapped! To make matters worse, King Koopa used his magic to change the inhabitants of our kingdom into bricks, horsetails, and more! How horrible! You two are the only ones who can save our kingdom from this crisis. Please rescue Princess Peach and restore peace to this kingdom, however you can! But why us? Oh, there's a legend. "Male twins shall journey from the Kingdom of the East... donning sailor caps and overalls. Knobby noses, goggling eyes, and cute little mustaches. Kindhearted, but also money-seeking." Princess Peach believes in this legend, and that is why she sought the help of you boys. At least that was her plan... Mario! Please rescue me! Mario! So then... At this rate, the Princess will be forced to marry King Koopa! Marry? On the next Friday the Thirteenth. Princess Peach... married? I won't have it! I don't care if he's a Koopa or a Bibimbap, I'm not letting him get away with this! No! Now, will you tell us where to go? If you head directly east from this point, you will most certainly reach King Koopa's palace. However, you must first pass through dangerous valleys and forests, steep mountains, and vast oceans! It'd sure be nice if we could take a non-stop flight on a plane or something... But, in order to defeat King Koopa, especially his magic, you must obtain the strength of the three Power-Ups. The three Power-Ups? Yes, three items with unusual powers, the Mushroom, the Flower, and the Star! The Mushroom, the Flower, and the Star? However, King Koopa's henchmen have separated the Mushroom, the Flower, and the Star, sealed their magical powers, and hid them somewhere! I see. So finding those three Power-Ups is our top priority, then. Fine! You can count on us! Oh, so you'll go? You really are as grand as the legend says, Mario. Thank you. It'll be a piece of cake! Come on, Luigi. We are gonna get paid lots for this, right? If you'd accept gold coins, you'll find some buried here and there. Take as many of those as you wish. All right, that's the stuff, old man! Leave it to me! I'll dig up all the coins! Woo-hoo! Now, you run along too, Kibidango. Make sure they don't get lost. I pray for your success!

Ah, I sure am hungry. I wanna eat some steak. And some chicken and hamburgers. Eels, tempura, and oyako-don. Curry, pilaf, and spaghetti. Pudding, crêpes, and chocolate parfaits! Yakitori, edamame, and cold tofu... Huh? Why, you! How dare you steal someone's dreams like that! Burp! Now I'm even hungrier! I'm gonna die. You seem to be having trouble with a lack of food. Yes. Please, sir! If you've got something to eat, please share it with me! We do know where there's a valley of delicious mushrooms. I love mushrooms! Then follow us. Bro! I'm gonna go get some mushrooms! Mushrooms? Nom, nom, nom... What's that? Luigi? Huh? Oh, that way! That way! Yo, Bro! What took ya' so long? This place is the best! Come on! Don't hold back, Bro! You eat up too! Th-These are laughing-shrooms! - Hey, snap out of it, Luigi! - What're you doing? These are crying-shrooms, then! Okay, if I feed him another laughing-shroom, they should cancel each other out and he'll go back to normal! Here! Come on. Why, you! - Why, you! Why, you! Why, you! Why, you! - Ow, ow, ow, ow! What the heck, man?! - Now you've really made me mad! - Th-That was an anger-shroom! What the heck, man? What the heck, man? Alley-oop. What the...? Wh-Wh-What the...? What the...? Ah! Take that! There! Alley-oop. Okay, here you go. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Wait, guys, this food looks kinda weird! Let me test it for you! Ow, ow, ow, ow! My tummy hurts! That settles it. We can't eat this rotten food. Hey, Mom! Can't ya' get us something nicer? Like Hamburg steaks or some croquettes? What did you say? - I want steak! I wanna eat steak! - Hamburg steak! I wanna eat a Hamburg steak! Okay, okay. - Hamburg steak! - Steak! Are you okay, Luigi? No thanks to you! Sorry I'm so rotten! I'm out of here! How do we get down from here, Bro? If descent is impossible, then that means... Ascending is our only choice! Ascending?! That's one of the three Power-Ups! It's gotta be the Mushroom of Truth! All right! Mario! That's dangerous! Coins! Coins! Coins! Coins! Coins! Coins! These guys are hopeless... My gold coins... Found one! The coins...! Thank you for freeing us from King Koopa's magic. I am the mushroom retainer Toad, Princess Peach's maid. Princess Peach's? Come, friends, let us thank them! You're wonderful! Mario! You're so cute! Master Mario, please take this Super Mushroom with you. I-Is this the Power-Up? And rescue Princess Peach as soon as you can! You're wonderful! Master Mario! You're so cute! Darn it! Farewell!

Boku-ra Super We are Super Hmm... Which way are you going? We're trying to figure out the best way to go east. There are countless courses that lead east. The wayside grass course, the catnap course, the flower garden course... You have many options such as those, sir. Flower garden course, you say? Yes! Surrounded by beautiful flowers and their beautiful aromas, it truly is a luxurious course to take! The flower garden course... Makes you wish they had a treasure-hunting course... And maybe, the Flower Power-Up might be in that garden! Okay, it's decided then! Matte na yo Piichi-hime Just sit tight, Princess Peach Tasuke ni umi koe yama koe To rescue you, we'll go past the seas, past the mountains, Tani koe, oka koete past the valleys, and past the hills Boku-ra Super dakedo I don't know We are Super, but I don't know What an indescribably beautiful smell.

C-Cute little flowers? You mean those man-eating ones? That's right! I intended to lure you boys here and feed you to my cute little flowers! What? But we're not plant food!

Okay, wait right there! Gotta hurry! Woah... Woah... Woah... Okay... Oops, stop, stop, stop. Now then... Is this how it works? Um, oh, here we go... So the rainy season monsoon first?

Hey, Mario! There are tons over here! Woah, look at that! Gold coins going all the way inside! Let's go! Coins! Coins! This is awesome! These are... I-I-It's a real gold nugget! We've discovered a gold mine! Oh no! We can't get out! What should we do? Hey, guys, do me a favor! Get us out of here, okay? Oh, but we cannot do that. Entering someone's gold mine without permission is a serious crime! Sorry about that. It's our fault. But please, let us go! We need to rescue Princess Peach! That reminds me, the wedding between Princess Peach and the great King Koopa is tonight! It is sure to be a magnificent ceremony! And with this, we should be highly rewarded too. What? Why, you little scoundrels! This Hammer Brother is a master at throwing his hammer. So there better not be any funny business. Just spend the rest of your life watching the ocean from there. P-Please wait! ["Ono" = axe/hatchet/hammer] Oh no, hammer... It's our fault for being distracted by the gold... Oh, Princess Peach, I was so foolish! Please forgive me! Amazing! Amazing! There's more gold here than we could dig up in our lifetimes. Right, Bro? That dummy... Ah, Princess Peach... Oh... Please come rescue me soon, Mario. Please! Peach, sweetie. Eh? Say, Peach, sweetie... So about tonight's wedding, what kind of wedding dress do you want? A pink one? A white one? Or maybe a... Cut it out! Who said I'd marry you?! I'll never go through with it! B-But, I am the one who... Um... L-Loves you more than anyone else, Peach, sweetie. If you really loved me, you wouldn't put me through this endless suffering! Hey, Peach, sweetie, please. Don't make that face. Cheer up, okay? Then... Let's play dress-up. Hey, turn into something amusing for me. O-Oh, please! I'm busy enough with the preparations for our wedding! No! Peach must play dress-up or she'll be upset! Upset! O-O-O-Okay! Okay, if it's for you, Peach, sweetie... Then, change into a Pokero. "Pokero?" How's this? My! How lovely! Then, next try a Buchimonta! "Buchimonta?" Uh, let's see... "Buchimonta..." - How lovely! - I guess this is about right. Say, this time around I'd like you to turn into something small and cute! Something small and cute? Let's see... How about a little teddy bear? I love those! Gotcha, gotcha. A teddy bear. Aw! How cute! Now I've got you! What in the...?! Sorry about this. But this was my only choice. That sort of trickery won't work on me, Peach, sweetie. Unhand me! - Now... - Stop! I hope you won't think of any more silly things like trying to escape from me. Hmph! Just you wait! Mario will come rescue me any minute now! He'll knock you out for good! Mario? He's not coming. Yes, he is! I know he will! Earlier, I received a message from one of my minions. He said they've captured this Mario guy. Sorry about the disappointment. Eh? Y-You're lying! It can't be! You're just saying that so I'll give up! Your lies won't work on me! Well, whether you believe me or not is your choice. Either way, you will marry me soon. Bye, for now. It... It can't be! I won't believe it! Mario! Hurry!

We've made sure that Mario guy won't be able to do a thing. Well done. You shall be well rewarded. By the way, is my sweetie Peach ready yet? - Paint, paint, pat, pat. - Hurry it up! Paint, paint, pat, pat. - Paint, paint, pat, pat. - Thicker! Okay, paint, pat. I guess this'll do. - And now the veil, and... tah-dah! - Okay, and now for some powder. - Okay, pat, pat, pat. - Very pretty. Very pretty. What do you think? Oh, give me a break! I can't take much more of this embarrassment! Peach, sweetie! I've been waiting for you! There. The bridal throne! Father, begin the ceremony at once! All right... Ah, Mario, they must have captured you after all. What should I do now? Hang in there! Great King Koopa, takest thou Princess Peach as thy lawfully wedded wife? Wilt thou vow to love her and to dedicate thyself to the Koopa Clan's prosperity as long as thou art alive? Of course! Princess Peach, takest thou the Great King Koopa as thy lawfully wedded husband? Wilt thou vow to devote thy love to the prosperity of the Koopa Clan as long as thou art alive? Y-You will, right, Peach, sweetie? Peach, sweetie? Peach, sweetie! Come on, Peach, sweetie! Don't just sit there, say something! Please! Oh? Is that all? Can't you say anything more? With a smile too? Ah! I'm so happy! Ah! You're happy! How long have I, Peach, been waiting for this moment.

Mario! Over here! Over here! Impudent pigs! Shoot them down! Mario! Over here! How dare they interrupt my precious wedding... What is the meaning of this?! Th-Th-This wasn't supposed to happen... Go get them at once! Y-Yes, sire! We will continue the ceremony in the sealed room! Come, Father! Mario! Princess Peach! Save me, Mario! Princess Peach! A secret path! Wait up! Oh... Now's my chance! Go! Okay! One of those entrances must lead to King Koopa's room. But how do we... And the moth flies into the flame! This is an infernal area of fear! If you want to pass, you'd better use these lifts. Fine! Oh, let's heat things up even more with this! Have some nice fireballs! There! What's that? Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Coins, coins, coins, coins! Coins, coins, coins! Coins, coins! Coins, coins, coins, co... Huh...? What's this? Wh-Wh-What the...?! Luigi! My, oh my. What a nice, hot bath! And now, please exchange the engagement rings. Peach, sweetie, please accept my ring! With your cute little hand! What in the world? I-I guess it was too big. Although, I guess if it's more like a bracelet, that just means my love is even bigger! I hate it! I'm sorry, don't be mad! I'll have it remade for you at once! What? Princess Peach! Mario! Princess Peach! What? How dare you ruin my precious wedding! Do you have any idea what happens to those who oppose me?! Let me show you! Hot, hot, hot! Phew. Wh-What are you...? Get off! Mario!

Here goes! Mario! Okay... Oh, Mario Rice Seasoning! I love this stuff! All right! - Yum, yum, yum! - Watch out, Mario! Take this! The Star! The Star...! Well then, shall I deliver the final blow? Please! Don't hurt Mario anymore! I'll do anything you ask of me. Just spare Mario! What did you say? I'll become your bride. So please... Please... You say you'll become my bride? Don't do it, Princess Peach! You can't do that... So please... I'm begging you! I can't do that. He already ate the Mushroom and Flower Power-Ups. If I let him live, things might get a lot more inconvenient for me. Alley-oop. Huh? Bro, so this is where you've been? Look! You dropped the Star! The Star! Throw it into my mouth! The Star? That son of a... Hurry up! I'll do it, but it doesn't look that tasty. - The Star! - Huh?! Have you learned your lesson, Mario? How does it feel to be flattened like a pancake? Well? Well? Well? How does it feel? How does it feel? How does it feel? - Woah, woah! Um... - Take this! Princess! Mario! Princess Peach, thank goodness you're safe! Curse you, Mario! Bring it, King Koopa! One, two! One, two! Uppercut! Hooray! Hooray! Go for it! Leggo! Leggo! Leggo! - Leggo! Leggo of me! Leggo of me! - Heave-ho! Ah, you win this time... Mario! You did it, Bro! Mario, you really are a wonderful hero! Huh? What's that? That's our castle. Now that the spell is broken, everything has returned to normal. It sure is beautiful! And it's all thanks to you, Mario. That's right! I almost forgot... Here you go. Oh, my! Well then, where did you find this? When you came to my house, Princess, you dropped it. I see. Thank you. I've been wearing this ever since I was born. It's very precious to me. Legend has it that someday, a wonderful prince who has the same necklace will appear. The same necklace? H-Huh? Um... Hey, didn't we have a necklace just like this back at the shop? No? Princess Peach, fear not! I, Mario, promise to find that matching necklace for you! Oh? Are you...? I am the prince of the neighboring Flower Kingdom. My name is Haru. So you're Prince Haru. On my way to visit the Princess, I was unwittingly turned into a dog by King Koopa's magic. Wh-Which means the Princess' real fiancé is... Mario, Luigi, thank you. You men are my saviors. You are true heroes! Mario! Mario! Hang in there, Mario! Mario! Your happiness is my happiness, Princess. Mario, thank you. Don't mention it. Mario, Luigi, I wish you could stay with us. Well, we have our shop to look after. Without you two, it will be very lonely here in the Mushroom Kingdom. Aw, cut it out. If some bad guys come back, we'll come rescue you again! Right, Luigi? Now then, let's go, Luigi. Farewell! Mario! Luigi! Take care, you two! True courage is born from true love. That is the true Power-Up, the symbol of a hero, Mario.
