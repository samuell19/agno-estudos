Â™Ş As promised, our beaches are safe once again. We have taken every precaution to ensure that this is the last shark you'll see in these waters for a very long time. Now, let's hit the water and get the summer started. Yeah, let's go! Mayor! Mayor! We may still have a shark problem. Lower your voice, Raymond! Don't be an ass. We don't have a shark problem without a shark. Mr. Walker says we caught the wrong one. It's too small. - I've heard that one before. - But what if he's right? He's not! Besides, Raymond, we never hired him. He doesn't work for us, remember? - Well maybe we should. - Maybe he should take his over-priced services somewhere else. Somewhere that actually has a shark problem. He says the public has a right to know. Where is that son of a bitch? Now, you see here, you son of a bitch! If you think for one second I'm going to stand by and allow you to spread wild rumors to the press about another sh ...shark, you're stupider than I thought! Why is it you people never listen? - I hate the damn ocean. - Are we clear? Look! Cindy! Cindy! Okay, come on... - Behind you! - Ahh! Hi! I don't think we've met. I'm Chase Walker. There's someone at the door. Go away! All right, all right! Well, hello. Hmm. Chase Walker? Oh, look, I'm sure I'm not the father, I'm always very careful that way. We can all be thankful for that. Well, hey, wait! Where are you going? We were just getting to know each other. Be ready to go in 10 minutes. I'm ready to go now. Mmm... Where are you going? To where the sharks fly, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. You deserve it. You know, it's been over 10,000 miles, and I still don't know anything about you. I think we should probably keep it that way. Come on, I don't even know your name. - Do you ever stop talking? - One of my many charms. What can I say? It's Jasmine. Jasmine... I like that. You know what I love about South Africa, Jasmine? That none of the girls here know anything about you? Ha! Good one. But no. I love South Africa because I'm here getting to know you. Okay, look, you can cool it, all right? I'm not one of your little beach girls that's gonna fall for your endless supply of cheesy lines. You know, there's a lot to be said for learning how to take a compliment. So... Is Jake house-sitting or what? Hell of a view, wouldn't you say? Not really my taste, but whatever floats your boat. I see you're still not a fan of the water. So what gives? Did you rob a bank or con some woman out of her fortune, because we both know you're sure as hell not smart enough to make this kind of money on your own. Yeah, I'd be careful there, Chase. Things have kind of changed since you and I were kids. Yeah? Sorry to see your face never really got over that awkward phase. Always a smart ass, eh? Always a criminal. Jake specializes in high-end security transportation services. There's nothing criminal about it. I see you have her well-trained. - I am his lawyer. - Okay... She's very protective. Letting a girl fight your battles. I thought you said things had changed since we were kids. Trust me, this is one girl you don't want to get on the wrong side of. Might be a little late for that, but thanks for the tip. What is it you want? The only thing you're good for. I want you to kill a shark. You know what this is, Biggs? This is a piece of Chase, bought and paid for. You see, I'm the only man that ever saved Chase's life, and this is from the shark that was gonna kill him. He owes me. So now, when I whistle, he comes double time. Isn't that right, Chase? There's a great white that ate something of mine. You're going to get it back for me. Well, a shark can eat a lot of things. What are you looking for? An old pair of boots, maybe a license plate? It's the largest diamond in existence. It's unsellable because it's priceless. One of a kind. Kind of like Jasmine here. I can assume there was some idiot in possession of this priceless diamond when it was eaten? There's a lot of great whites out there. Just so you know, I kill the wrong one, it's not my problem. This one's got a big black fin. Real big. I've never seen anything like it. Couple of notches in the scoop. You'll know it. What're you still standing here for? We're done. Next time I see you, I want something bright and sparkly distracting me from that ugly face of yours. I'm gonna need a driver. Someone who knows the area. Whatever. Hire someone. That's your problem. You owe me the favour, remember? Yeah. I remember. I'll take her. - How much does she charge? - Really? - She's off limits. - I completely understand. A guy like you needs to be careful. You can't have her spending too much time with a real man. Okay. Give it your best shot. Oh, no. No, no, no, no-- Take him wherever he needs to go until this thing is done. I am not a chauffeur, especially not for this moron! You're wasting time. The quicker you find the shark, the quicker you'll be done with the moron. You've got to be kidding me. What? How dare you! Is this going to be an ongoing thing? The slapping? Because I kinda like it. Okay, look, I am not some prize in your stupid competition. Oh, wait, just so we're clear, Jake's the one with the attitude, not me. "How much does she charge"? Hey, you can't go holding everything I say against me. We will never get along. Ha! Look, just... get in the car... get in the car. Okay, so what's the story with the shark tooth? Ask my brother. Okay, and who's your brother? Jake, ask Jake. Jake is your brother? Well... not by blood, thank God. I'm adopted. No, no, no-no-no-no-no-no-no. There's been a mistake. I can't stay here. Don't worry, Jake's picking up the tab. Oh, sorry, dude. This is close to the ocean. I hate the ocean. I hate the sound of it, I hate the look of it, and I hate the smell of it. Are you kidding me? I never kid about this. You're in Cape Town, you're practically surrounded by the ocean, and not to mention, you're here to hunt a shark. Yeah? Well, I'm not getting out of this car. Nope, and I am not staying here. Now this. This is what I'm talkin' about. You are so strange. All right, I'll need you to pick me up at 7 a.m. Mm-hmm. We're gonna need a guide, a boat, sonar, a depth finder, GPS, the works. And don't forget, dive equipment. And maybe a smaller car. Pass, pass, pass, pass! Yes, yes... - Hi, excuse me... - Yes? Do you have any rooms available? "Rooms available"? Around the corner. Number 6. Um... you can't see the ocean, right? "You can't see the ocean"? You're in Langstraat, there's no ocean in Langstraat. Langstraat. Enh? Come, come, the game is on. You can't smell it either, right? "Smell it"! I get a lot of complaints about the smell, but it ain't the ocean, my bro. Thanks. Come, come, come. Come-come-come-come! Yes, yes, yes... Goal! Chase, if you're not out here in the next 30 seconds, you can find yourself another ride, and I don't care what Jake says. Thanks for the ride. I had a really great time. See ya. Good! You're on time. Ahh, I feel great. Not even the smell of the ocean can ruin it. I'm so happy you slept well. I didn't sleep a wink. So, where's this guide you hired? Shouldn't he be helping us get all this stuff? You're looking at your guide. But this isn't Flipper we're talking about here. No, no, no, this is a shark. A great white shark. And, by the sound of it, a hell of a big one. I need a real guide, someone who knows what they're doing, not just a weekend wannabe. I've been diving these waters for a long time. Trust me, you're in good hands. Look, I'm really serious about this, I... I think maybe we can make this work. Okay, so this is the spot that Biggs said his men got attacked. You don't actually think that this thing is hanging out down here waiting to be caught? No, but we've gotta start somewhere, right? Right, but a shark the size that Biggs described is probably closer to Geyser Rock, where there's plenty of seals to snack on. I completely agree. So you won't be needing a spear gun when you go down there. When I go down there? Yeah, you know, in the water, under the boat. Someone has to go look for the diamond, in case the shark didn't swallow it. No, see that part I understood, but don't you mean, when we go down there? I mean, this is your job. No, I'm not going down there. Haven't you been listening? I hate the ocean. Oh, fine. You don't wanna go down there, I guess we can just hang out up here until we find something better to do. I should warn you, though. I like to sunbathe in the nude. No-no-no, no, no, really. I would rather take my chances with the shark. There's way too much area to cover. If it's down there, we're never gonna find it. So you're giving up. Is that what I'm hearing? No, I am not giving up. But why don't you stop being such a wuss and get in the water? I told you I... Jasmine? Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Help me! Help me! Look who's all wet now. Is the great Chase Walker at a loss for words? Oh, I've got plenty of words, you're just not going to like any of them right now. Chase! Behind you. Oh, yeah, right. Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase, where are you? Chase! Hey! Will you give me a hand here or what? - You okay? - Phew! Oh, man! What is it with sharks and boots anyway? - Yeah, I thought you were... - Dead? Huh? See, you are starting to fall for me. No, I thought you were gonna kill it. Well, she caught me by surprise is all. And as I recall, there was someone distracting me at the time. Yeah, excuses, excuses. Oh! Don't forget these. Ugh. Well, it's all they had in your size, so... I'm going to kill that shark just to get my boots back. Well, it's always good to have a goal. See you at 700-- oh, and... maybe ask your girlfriend if she can set the alarm. I'm sure between the two of you, you can figure out how to work it. Wait a minute. Look, guys, it's been a long day. I'm not really in the mood. Get in the car. Sorry, man. It's late. I'm hungry. I've got some new shoes to try on. My night's pretty full. Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin. Get in the car. You're hilarious. That's an improvement. Whoa. On second thought, let's go for a drive. Where are we going? Screw you. Try again. Listen, these people... You don't know who you're messing with. Nix, he runs this town! Wrong answer. Come on! All right, all right! 22 Water Street. - At the docks. - See? That wasn't so hard. Hey, violinist! Don't go passing out on me, man. I don't know my way around here. Aah! - Not so fast, my man. - It's cool. I'm expected. Nix actually sent me his own personal invite. Really thoughtful of him, really. You can go and get it in the car, if you want. Look, just tell him Chase Walker is here to see him. I have to frisk you. We were getting along so well. I understand someone by the name of Nix is interested in having a little face-to-face. Interested indeed. Quite the operation you've got here. Tik, Mr. Walker. Drug of the masses. It's always nice to meet a dedicated public servant. Care for a sample? Fresh kill. Always the tastiest. It's been a long day. How about we just skip the theatrics, and you tell me what the hell it is you want? Boss, I'm sorry, we asked him to... If I'd have known you were going to do that, I wouldn't have put so much effort into beating him up. I know all about your arrangement with that little parasite, Jake. - So? - So... the diamond Jake wants you to find belongs to me. That's right. I paid him to steal that diamond from one of his security trucks. Paid him well. But it appears he's gotten greedy. He even had the audacity to kill two of my best men, if you can believe it. Yeah... I can see you treat your men just like family. You're missing my point, Mr. Walker. You're right. What is your point? My point is, you're a man that enjoys life. Good food, good drink, good women. I too appreciate the art of self-indulgence. As you can see, I have quite a passion for diamonds. Just a pretty rock, if you ask me. Oh, no, no. They are much more than that, I assure you. Their great beauty aside, diamonds... are among the hardest substance in the world. A lifetime of pressure makes them nearly unbreakable. This is something I can relate to. So many people have... tried to take what's mine, tried to kill me, that I've lost count. I've been shot... stabbed, run over, you name it. But like these diamonds, I too am nearly unbreakable. Are we, uh, getting close to the point where you tell me what it is you want? Fair enough. If you wish to stay alive, you will cut my diamond out of that shark, and return it to its proper home. Could have just called, told me that over the phone, no? Right you are. I'll be seeing you, Mr. Walker. I didn't give you my answer yet. It wasn't multiple choice. Pick your enemies wisely, Mr. Walker. Ask around. I'm a hard man to kill. Um, do you know any people who... Excuse me? Do you know what happened here? - She followed us. - Where the hell have you been? - She followed us here. - Who? Black Fin. "Black Fin," what, the... What, the shark? She killed two people and a dog right here in the marina last night. - Oh, my God. - Now every moron with a boat has gone out there looking for her. Like we don't know how that's going to end. So what exactly are we doing? I went shopping. Got us some new toys. Okay... Hey, what happened to your shoes? Whatever it was I was picking up on the depth finder is long gone now. There's a pretty large hunting group headed toward Seal Island. They're not going to find her out there. Oh, come on, you don't actually think that this thing is stalking us, that it followed us to the marina. She was hunting us. Leaving a message. A "message"? I mean, come on, it's just a big fish. It's just a big fish? Did you know that a shark is the only fish that picks its head up out of the water just to see what's going on? They're smart creatures. They adapt, they plan, they hunt, and they kill. So, what exactly is it that you're doing? They make these devices that mess with their electrical signals and help repel sharks. I changed the electronics around to help attract sharks. Smart, huh? You changed the electronics? All by myself. Yeah, but doesn't that take, like, physics or electrical engineering and... And maybe you're not the only one on this boat with an Ivy-league education. All right, now all we gotta do is find the voltage that makes old Black Fin salivate. So why don't we just chum the water? I mean, a shark can smell blood for miles. Nah, that hunting party is going to have the ocean red with chum. We need something that'll cut through all that. Okay. So what do we do now? Now... We wait, and we watch. I mean, come on, you don't expect me to believe that that little black box is... Wait... Ah. Well, well, well. You didn't think it would work, did you? I mean, I was just a little bit skeptical, so... Maybe if you stick around long enough, I might prove you wrong on a few other things. Now, what's going on? Well, what are you doing? Those sharks were too small, probably makos or tigers. We need to find the voltage that brings in the big ones. The whites. Let's just go the same direction as those other sharks, quarter speed. Aye-aye, captain. How's it going down there? Well, the changes I made should do it. Should draw her in. Okay. Stop the boat! Where are we? We're in the exact spot Jake's guys were attacked. Son of a bitch! Can anybody hear me? Is anybody out there? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello, is anybody there? Goddamn amateurs! Okay, look, we're not getting anyone because there's too much chatter from that stupid hunting expedition. She lead them here on purpose. She wanted to kill them here. Yeah, okay, that doesn't make any sense, Chase. She's marking her territory. Okay, look, if even part of that is true, then that's more reason to go back and get some help. Okay, what are you doing? You're not going in there. If she were here, we would pick her up on the sonar. - Not if she's hiding. - Hiding where? The wreckage right below the boat. Okay, look, Chase, this is stupid. You're not going in there. Chase... Chase! Don't go... God damn it, Chase... Chase! Whoo! Now that... was a rush. What the hell were you thinking, going down there like that? Oh, what the hell were you doing down there at all? You could have got yourself killed! I was worried about you! What... Ahh... Okay, what are you smiling about, you idiot? We almost just died. You've fallen for me, haven't you? I have not. Ha ha! No, you've fallen for me, fallen hard. You know, I didn't think that ego of yours could possibly get any bigger. I know, it's impressive, right? Hey, what are you doing? That was just round one down there. I've got to go finish her off before she kills again. Yeah, well if you think that I'm gonna stick around and watch you get killed, then you're dumber than I thought. See? You have fallen for me! Oh, Jesus. So... how did a girl like you end up with a guy like Jake, anyway? So, why does a guy like you hate the ocean so much? I have my reasons. I'm all ears. Okay, I'll go first. First of all, I am... I don't... I'm not with Jake, I work for Jake. I happen to be a very good lawyer, and he's in need of a very, very good lawyer. And the money's not so bad. Okay, your turn. I was 17. I was supposed to go fishing with my father on our boat. I don't even remember why I didn't go. He hit a really bad storm. Never saw him or the boat again. So now Jake blames you. He's right. I should have been there. Chase, I'm so sorry. JASMINE! Where the hell have you been? Nix is on the bloody warpath, and you disappear for two bloody days! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jake, take it down a notch. We were looking for your shark. Thank you, not talking to you. Where the hell were you last night? Excuse me? You were with my asshole brother, weren't you? Oh, hoo hoo! I love it when she does that. You're done with him. Now get in the bloody car! - Jake, you're hurting me! - Nix has guys all over the bloody place, man, it isn't safe here! Jake! If you ever wanna get off this dock, I suggest you keep your hands off her! - You keep your bloody hands... - You two guys stop it! I got this. You disappear for two days, Chase doesn't check into his hotel room, what the hell do you think I'm supposed to think, man? Stop thinking. You're not very good at it. Are you coming or what? Where are we going? - Anywhere but here. - Ha ha! Come on, come on, come on! You think you know who I am, Chase, but you're wrong. You have no idea what I'm capable of! Oh, I've got a pretty good idea what a coward like you is capable of, after what I saw in that shipwreck today! Shipwreck? Hello! I'm in the bloody water, here! Get him out of there! Sorry, boss! - You okay? - Yeah. It's probably done. Thank you. Look at you, all prepared. I got these from a guy's car I borrowed last night. - Don't ask. - Okay. What was it that you were telling Jake, about what you found in the wreck? Don't you think we've talked enough shop for one day? Cheers. You know, Jake and I, there's... I don't know why he's being such an asshole. People rarely turn out to be who you think they are. Well, look at you, being all insightful. Like I said, people rarely turn out to be who you think they are. I guess I've just spent so many years swimming with sharks... ...of one kind or another. What you need is a really big knife. Oh... Big knife. That's it. All right. Okay, so, why don't you... tell me something... about sharks that I don't already know? Real ones or metaphorical ones? Mm... You choose. The lateral line... runs down the entire length of a shark, allowing them to hear their prey. All along their entire body. Jake? I swear to God, I'm going to kick the crap out of you. Damn. Chase... Is that the sound of a couple of love birds I can hear? Hey-- who the hell are you? Hey, don't touch her! Let me go! Didn't think Nix was keeping tabs on you, huh? What are you doing? Just taking out a little insurance. Get your hands off of me! You see, everybody and their brother's uncle will be out looking for Nix's shark, and that's not good. Ha ha! Hate to think what'll happen if someone finds that shark before you do... Before you kill it and bring Nix what's his. Your girl here, she's got an expiration date. Yeah, and Nix wouldn't want her going bad. Get in touch when you've got something to trade, Mr. Walker! Jasmine... JASMINE! Let me out! LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT! Jake? You home? You're on my hand... Biggs... Thought you were dead. Do I look dead? Kinda... Besides the whole talking thing... You look really dead, Biggs. Listen, if you're looking for that two-timing, back-stabbing, low-life, no good-- Son of a bitch? Where is he? He took off the moment Nix's men showed up. Sounds like help's on the way. Biggs? How is it, brother? Huh? Just the son of a bitch I've been looking for. Oof! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! My gun, we're going to need that-- Ow. Hey, hey, hey! Cool it! Cool it! - Cool it, cool it. - Oh. You're asking me to cool it after you put a gun to my head? Well, look at it from my perspective! How do I know you're not working with Nix's guys, huh? You know, Mom always said you had trust issues. Yeah, well, that figures, considering she always liked you better than me, better than her own flesh and blood. She didn't like me better, she just-- she just didn't care much for you. You see, now that's just mean. - Okay, okay! - Come here, come here! Well, what did you expect? You spent half of high school in juvie. Yeah, and while I was away, you got all the perks, didn't you, college boy? It's not my fault you were such a screw-up. Or maybe I got into so much trouble because I wanted some attention, huh? Did that ever occur to you? I could just never keep up with the great Chase Walker! Okay, okay, man! - Just wanna say... - Oh! Aah! Huh? Huh? You okay? I think you broke my nose. Good! What's the deal with the accent, anyway? I mean, you're from Hawaii. Yeah, well... When in Rome, you know? You got some serious problems, man. And I saw... what was going on at that shipwreck. You cuffing those people for the sharks? That's messed up, man. No, that wasn't me. You gotta know that that's all Nix's doing, all right? I mean, if one of his guys just looks at him wrong, he pops them. Feeds the body to the sharks to get rid of it. Ugh... Black Fin's protecting her feeding ground. When I heard where he wanted to meet, I knew he was going to try to take out my guys, so yeah, we killed all of his guys. Well, we may need to kill a few more. Hey, look, I'm really glad you're taking this all so personally, but right now, I just want to get that shark, get my diamond, and get the hell out of here. I don't think that's going to happen. Oh, the hell it is, or have you forgotten you owe me? Nix has Jasmine. And? And he's expecting his diamond. Straight-up trade, so either we go get your stupid diamond, or we get the girl. Well, that's a no-brainer. Nix totally wiped me out, all right? He took everything I have. Without that diamond, I'm ruined. All right, fine. You go get the diamond, and good luck with that. I'm gonna get Jasmine. Whoa, whoa, okay! I'm joking. Hello! I'm joking. Of course, you're going to get Jasmine first, huh? But, uh, then we'll get my diamond, right? You're dead, you hear me? You're dead! Nix wants her in one piece. At least to start with. Take off her clothes. Don't you dare come near me! Fine, we'll do this the hard way. If you assholes touch me again, I swear I will kill you! It's not us you need to worry about, princess! We're just here to get you ready. Ready for what? Nix has got a romantic night planned for the two of you, and he likes his girls clean and proper. Okay, yup. Okay, okay. Good, good, yup. Oh, yeah, yeah, I like your thinking. Take them all out from here. Okay, now, be careful with that! Wait, hang on, um... You sure this is the smart play, hmm? Two of us against Nix's entire gang, I don't know. Something's not adding up here, Chase. It's alright, we've got the advantage. Oh, uh, yeah, Sorry, how, exactly? We've got the element of surprise. Yeah, they'll be surprised, all right, when they realize it's just two of us. Don't get your panties in a bunch. Let's figure out how many of them there are first. Hey, wait! Where are you going? Shh. You're gonna want one of these, first. No, no. I'm better with these. Just watch my back, okay? You're gonna watch my back, right? Okay, you realize those guys have guns, all right, lots of guns, and they will shoot us on sight with those guns. Okay, you do it your way, I'm gonna do it my way, and I'm not shooting anyone. You don't think you could have told me this, well... Any time before now? You're nuts, you know that? Fine, you wanna get yourself killed trying to save that bitch, you be my guest but... Don't call her that, you understand? Aw, little Chase has a crush. Ahh... Now you've done it. No, no-no-no, no, no. LM-4? Nice! See, if you wanna sneak up on someone, that's the way you do it. Oh! - Huh? - What did I just tell you? - There they are! - Oh. Oh, oh, oh! Here! Here! What the hell was that? We were supposed to surprise them. Well, did you see the look on their faces? I think those two were surprised. Hey, hold the door! What? What are you doin'? Hey! Easy with the guns already! You know, I think it's about time you start respecting my stuff! Go ahead. Take it out. Have fun with that. I'm gonna go get Jasmine. You coming or not? It's not like I have much of a choice, now do I? What is going on out there? Sounds like somebody got past the front gate. It's nothing we can't handle. Good. Because Jasmine and I... have got a very special night ahead of us. Screw you! All in good time, my dear. All in good time. Boss, it's that Chase Walker again. He's in the building. Well, then, I'll be needing my work clothes. And you... Chase Walker is in the building! It seems your night is not going to be so pleasurable after all. Take her to my table. Ooh! Um... Hey! A little help here? I think you got it under control. So, tell me, how's that no gun thing working out for you? Look, you wanna keep doing things the hard way, be my guest, but I'm telling you, shooting them... A lot easier. See? - Come on. - But we gotta get the g-- the guns! Hey, hey, hey, we gotta go back for the bag, it's got all the ammo in it. You wanna go back, be my guest. All right... - Which way? - Left. You're a real asshole, you know that? Maybe we should have gone left. You think? You know, maybe if you'd listen to me for once? I learned at a very young age to never take your advice. Hey, hey, I think you've forgotten that without me, you wouldn't even be alive right now-- Stop shooting! I have the diamond. Prove it. You son of a... bitch! Sorry, Jake, but if Nix doesn't get his diamond, he's gonna kill Jasmine. Okay, don't shoot. I'm going to come closer. If you've got the diamond, let me see it. That's not a diamond! Sorry, need that back. Chase! Oh, no, Chase, it's out of shells. Um... Where's Jasmine? Screw you. Where... is... Jasmine? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't you think that's enough? You're going to break it! This is a Clarkson Bullpup, Tactical Conversion. You can't just buy them. All right? You have to steal them from Special Forces. You know how hard that is? You're dupes. - What did you say? - Ahh! Where is she? Nix has her. Fourth floor. Asshole. Mr. Walker! Don't be shy. Join the party. I was just getting started. Well... Look what the cat dragged in. I hope for Jasmine's sake... that one of you has my diamond. Can we go get my diamond now? Chase! Oh, you're gonna need a much bigger gun than that. Chase... Lead-lined. Helps prevent workplace injuries. You have until noon to find that shark before anyone else does. Do I make myself clear, Mr. Walker? Fail me this time, and I will disassemble your girlfriend one piece at a time. Chase, help me... Do I make myself clear, Mr. Walker? Go, Jasmine! Don't be such a baby, you're wearing a Kevlar vest. You okay? Yeah. You may be a difficult man to kill, Nix, but I really don't see you outrunning this explosion. You're such a gentleman, Jake! No! Argh... What have you done? You okay? Oh, yeah... Yeah, my wrists are a little sore, but I'm fine. So, exactly why am I doing this? We're just over the shipwreck. The shark attractor should draw Black Fin in. And then hopefully that harpoon gun will float, and if all goes according to plan, I kill her. - And get my diamond. - Yeah, as promised. Okay, sounds like a good plan. Was that a compliment? You know, I, I guess it... What? It sounds like a good plan. Hey, listen... When I'm in the water, keep a close eye on Jake. He's being a little too cooperative. I will. Who the hell is shooting at us? I'm starting to lose patience with you, Mr. Walker! Nix? That little stunt you pulled back there... Not very nice, taking advantage of one's disabilities! How the hell do you expect me to get your diamond when you keep this up? Oh, I'm way past that. Now all I want to do is kill you. Okay, what's our move? We're going fishing. Hey, Nix! How's this for a bigger gun? Wow... Nice shot! Oh, crap. Quick, quick, give me your knife! Well, that's not good. Well, there's an understatement. Not only is the only real weapon we had on board gone, your little shark... finder gadget is all shot up, too! Well, maybe if you wouldn't've stolen from a psychopath, we wouldn't be in this situation! Maybe if you'd listened to me in the first place... Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! We can think of another solution. You know what? She's right. We'll do it the old-fashioned way. - Are you out of your mind? - I'm sorry! Without that diamond, I'm finished. Chase! Get me out of here! You're finished either way. You go do what you do, brother! It's okay, I got you. Chase... Stay behind me. Don't screw this up, Chase! Did he get it? Jasmine! Did he get it? Shut up, Jake, you stupid piece of crap! Sorry, sweetheart. Looks like you bet on the wrong guy. Um, hey... Jasmine, go! Get back to the boat! I can't, my leg! You... can't... have her... you... bitch! Aah! Um... Hey! Uh, hello! It's sinking! Hey, Jake, just let it go. All the sharks in the area are going to be all over her any minute. Don't do anything... ...stupid. - You okay? - Chase, he's not worth it. - He's my brother. - Chase. Chase! It's a lot of trouble for a pretty rock, if you ask me. Hmm... I think we've seen enough trouble for a little while. Hell of a view, wouldn't you say? Really? I mean, what happened to "I hate the ocean"? I wasn't talking about the ocean. Ugh, can you two give it a rest, already? Look, I am still not talking to you, Jake. - I told you, I'm sorry! - "I'm sorry"? I owe you, all right? No, it's Chase that you owe. Yeah, I whistle, you come double-time. - Isn't that right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I just see my diamond again? No! Hey, you guys, Australia has diamonds, right? It definitely has sharks. Â™Ş
