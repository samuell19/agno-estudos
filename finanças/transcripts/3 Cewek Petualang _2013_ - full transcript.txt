We're not in High School anymore. You suppose to grow up. Okay? I want you all to enjoy this vacation. Okay? Okay. Look at your boyfriend, Jubed. He even takes a picture of mating cats. He's happy here, isn't he? You be happy. Ouch! Jubed! Jubed! My God, Ju ... Jubed, Jubed! Jubed! Look out. You be careful. If you have bad intention ... ... you'll get bad luck. Jubed! You fool! You're so irritating! Honey ... ... artificial respiration, please? Honey ... Honey! Honey ... Where are you now, honey? I'm in the hotel. In my room. When will you meet that man? I'll surely find a right time, okay? When the time is right ... ... I'll see him right away. Okay, honey? Okay, honey. Okay. Will we have time to go around Belitung? Not now, later. I'm really focusing on going to the island ... ... I've been wanting to go to all this time right now. Dammit, Sal. If you're not about to get married ... ... and now is not the last chance for you to have a vacation together with us ... ... I won't go with you, Sal. You know I'm not a beach person, right? Yes. But you love me, do you, Cit? Right? That's why you're coming, right? Okay. Guys, listen. I must hurry to meet the tour guide ... .... because this island is the most private one. Good for diving ... ... also good for camping. Okay? Bye. Yes? Good evening. Good evening. Whom are you looking for? I'm Sally from Jakarta. I'm looking for Mr. Sikum. Mr. Sikum is my grandfather. Come in. Thank you. Please. Please have a seat. Thanks. Grandfather ... ... somebody's here to see you. Excuse me. I'm looking for something you are having. And I'm ready to buy it. Buy what? Where did you get this? I have an antique store in Jakarta. And I'm collecting those kinds of things. Now I've been looking for a piece of this parchment. I've heard you have it. But it's dangerous. If you don't know the function. But ... ... at least may I see it? What for? Please. I'll pay the price no matter how much. And I promise ... ... I'll take good care of it. No. Just go. What you're doing ... ... is very dangerous. You have waken up a soul from the past. Now go. But ... Please go. Fine. Thanks. I know what you're looking for. Call me Sabit. The one who knows all secrets in this place most. I also know what you're bringing. The half one. And I know ... ... what you're looking for to complete it. Tomorrow I'll go to an island in Belitung. So you want to go to that island? The place where the parchment is? Yes. Fine. That's up to you. But clearly ... ... you've heard what my grandfather said just now, right? You can wake up a soul from the past. This is no longer my business. Tomorrow ... ... I'll wait for you at the pier. And I will pay ... ... a very likely price. Good. Good then. Stop, stop, stop. Okay. Arrived already. Hey, the bag. Oh yes. So which is the direction of the pier, Sal? Pier's direction. There! Which is the right one? There or there? Right or left? There. It's there, right? Left? Left, so it means right? Then why this one points here? There ... ... this one ... ... picking my nose. This is when a blind one meets a dumb one. Not connected. Come on. Let's go. There, that's the place. Where? Just take that boat to get there ... ... that small boat probably. Come on, Sal. You go first, you go first. Where, Jubed? Hurry, hurry. Make it fast, okay? Okay, go. Here? Sorry, I'm late. It's all right. Where's that thing? Here it is. Mr. Sikum knows about this? If my grandfather knows ... ... he'll already chase you by now. Now where's the money? Here. Thank you. Hey, wait a second. This place I'm heading to ... ... is it good for diving? No. But if you're looking for the thing connected to that piece of map ... ... it's a perfect start. Thank you. I'm leaving now. Hello, honey. I got the parchment. Great. I'll contact our client immediately now. You're so great, honey. We're the winners. What do you think? Man, it's cool. Where's your scream? Oh, yes. I haven't paid yet. Thanks. Whoa, whoa, whoa ... You're not staying? If I'm staying here, I won't get any money. Nobody else here, especially tourists. All right then, but ... most importantly, you're gonna pick us up again, right? Yes, he will. Pick us up after three days. Deal? Yes, Miss. There. Thanks. / Yes. Be careful. / Yes. Be careful. Now it's time for us to find a camping ground. Over there or over there? Come on, this way. Let's just go over there. Over there? Okay, let's go. Watch out, many things with thorns here, bro. There, take some pictures here, for pre-wedding. You're going camping, aren't you? Yes. What about you? Just hunting. Be careful. Don't get too far inside. We've already put some traps for the animals. Take it easy. We're not getting scared easily. Excuse us then. Okay. Thanks. Belitung kids are no cowards. Sal, is it safe? It's safe. Never mind that. Look out. Cockroaches! Damn, the signal is very bad here. Hey, left, left, left. Over here, over here. Look out, look out. Watch out, it's sharp. Slowly. What an amazing scenery! This is so cool. I think it's a good spot for pitching a tent here. Yes. Cool, isn't it? Cool, isn't it?. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Very well then. Let's pitch the tent now. Before it gets dark. Okay. Let Jubed and Randu pitch the tent, okay? We just go taking pictures. Give me that. But if Citra wants to help them, that's fine with me. If Citra's not coming, I won't be coming either. Okay? We have to maintain our togetherness here. The girls gonna take pictures ... ... the guys gonna pitch the ‘tank', how's that? It's tent, Sal. Tent! Oh, they use different word now? Different word what? It is called ‘tent' indeed. Come on, let's move. Bye. Have fun. Honey, be careful. I will. Yes, I will, honey. Not you! My honey! Okay. Get the tent out. Okay. The place is so wonderful, isn't it? Why must go abroad ... ... while there are so many wonderful places in Indonesia, right? Cool, isn't it? / Very cool. Don't waste time. You, you, you. Take picture of us, okay? Okay. Come on. One ... One, two, three ... Two, three ... Enough, enough. Allow me. I keep on falling, thanks to you. Come on, come on. One, two ... Bed. Why is the tent so small? What do you mean small? This ... Take a look. Those girls are big. Jumbo size. I particularly bought this for five of us. The wind gets so cold at night in here, you know. So you can run your hidden operation ... ... getting close tightly when it's cold, right? My God. So there'll be togetherness, Randu, right? The closer we get ... ... the more solid we are. You're so good at reasoning, aren't you? Just like motor pedicab. Enough, enough, just find the stakes, just find the stakes. The stakes, the stakes. You are extra ordinary indeed. Enough, let's go back, okay? Okay, let's just go back. Are they nice? Okay. Nice, nice. There you go. Why is it so small? Where's our space? That's that, Sal. This ... Don't just look at its outer appearance. Eventhough it seems small at the outside, the inside is fine. You want us to crowd each other aside? You must have some hidden agenda. Let me tell you, okay? The wind gets very, very cold here at night. So if we crowd each other aside ... ... we'll get warm. Honey, honey, honey! You're just wasting your energy. Hitting him like this. We better swim, it's a good idea, isn't it? Yes, right, right. Good idea, good idea. Let's go swimming! Okay, we're going swimming, swimming! Honey, help me up. You ingrates. I'm coming with you! Swimming! One, two ... Honey, you so look beautiful. Let's go, let's start. Come on! Why is it dark? Stupid! That, that thing is not opened yet, the lid! Okay, hold it. Yes. The weather is strange, honey. How come? It wasn't this cloudy just now. Yes. Give me a sensual pose, okay? What's wrong, Bed? No, no, no. Nothing. Then let's continue. Yeah, let's continue. Okay, one, two ... What is it? What's wrong? I don't know, it seems ... ... there's something strange. Is it damaged? No, it can't be. What's the matter? Randu! Randu! Sally, help! Sally, help! Sally, help Randu! What's wrong? Randu! Sally, be careful, Sal! Sally! Sal, wake up, Sal. Sally, wake up. Ndu, wake up, Randu. What's wrong, Cit? There's something outside. What? I think there's ... ... there's something outside. Let me check it out. What is it? There's nothing here. No, Cit, there's nothing here. You must be dreaming. No, no, I haven't slept yet. I clearly see a shadow of a very big man reflects on our tent. Cit ... ... on this island ... ... there are only five of us. So there can't be anybody else in here. Yes, you're right, Sal. If there's another group of people here ... ... those hunters must have told us already. Where are you going, hey! / Randu! What is that? Looks like a strong wind. It was also strange this afternoon. Wind? It can't be the wind. The sea is calm. I think some giant has just passed by. Giant? And so does Spongebob, right? This is what you get when you're always making fairy tales. A little child's fantasy. Forget it, we better go back now, okay? My body's not well now. Okay? Wait a sec. Wait a sec. Now what? You fart, Bed? You're so awful! Enough, enough, enough. Let's just go back. It so stinks. Forget it. Let's go back. Jubed. Huh? Yes? What was that? Just like in Italy. The stones are expensive. This is Bangka, my man. Yeah, that Korean style ... Hey! Damn you all! You're so uncool. Abandoning me. Where's Jubed? He's your boyfriend, isn't he? Why are you asking us? I think he's already gone when I woke up this morning. Didn't he tell you where he went? No, he didn't tell me. He may just go sunrise hunting. I think so. He'll be back later, relax. Those kids ... ... the sun is high but they haven't waken up yet. They said they want a vacation. Oh, come on, guys. As a photographer I can't miss this kind of moment. Damn. Where the hell is Jubed anyway? Take it easy. He won't get lost in this small place, will he? Come on now. But ... Maybe he's not okay, right? It's cloudy and he's not back yet. I think we have to look for Jubed. Yes, we have to find him. Come on. What do you mean? Finding Jubed of course. Are you serious? He's a big boy. It's impossible for him to get lost. He will be back. Okay? Okay? Sal, you said it yourself that this place is small. If you're right, he surely won't get lost. But he's not back yet until now. So what do you think? Let's just go find him. You're right, and that's rare. Whose dog is this? Damn. I don't recall seeing a dog here. Hello. Dog. Are you ... ... relaxing in here? Doggie. Don't bite me, okay? Don't bite, okay? Calm down, okay? Good dog, good dog, good boy. Hello. A friend. Okay? Good dog, okay? Damn, you just stay silent. Haven't eaten anything yet for a year? One, two, three. Okay, good. Don't bite, okay? One, two, three. Good. Wanna see? Wanna see? Don't bite, okay? Good dog, yes. Here. Here. Okay? There, it's cool. Hey, where are you going? Doggie! Hell, he runs away. Oh, man. Fortunately he didn't bite me. He might be aware already so he's afraid. Seeing my handsomeness. Jubed! Jubed! Jubed! Bed, no kidding, please! Randu! Come here, Ran! There's a creature this big in here? Be careful of what you're saying. It's ... ... not a human. But it's an animal ... which lives in this island. Right? There, look. This is definitely not an animal's track. Oh, no. No way ... Help! Help! Help! Jubed! This looks like some kind of a ruined hall. But that looks like some kind of a symbol. Yes, the guide from Belitung said ... ... there used to be a palace on this island. Very interesting. Palace? Let's not get inside, okay? We're here already. We've come this far. Jubed might be inside. And you don't want to go inside? Oh, please! Let's just go inside, shall we? Let's go. Jubed! Jubed! Jubed? Jubed? Jubed? Bed? Jubed? I don't think Jubed is here. We better go back, okay? I'm scared. Hey. If you want to go back, fine. I still want to find Jubed. Back off! Sal. Come on. Come on, Sal. Jubed? Bed? Jubed? Jubed? Jubed. Jubed! Jubed! Jubed ... Jubed, wake up, Bed. Jubed, wake up, Bed. Jubed! Bed! Jubed vanishes! Jubed? Why this must happen to Jubed? Poor Jubed. He might have been eaten by a wild beast. Fuck it. Let's get the hell out of here, come on! Come on, come on, hurry up! Quick! Come on, come on, come on! Help! Help! Siska! Sis, hold my hand, Sis! You can reach it, Sis! It hurts. Now what, Randu? Randu, I sprained my ankle, Ndu. It hurts, I can't. Find a rope, find a rope. Find it. You wait a moment. I don't wanna be left alone! You wait here. I don't wanna be alone! I'm scared! Citra. Open it, open it. The bag, the bag. Where, where? The blue one, open it. Well? Got it, come on! Citra? Citra, I'm sorry. You know that I'm so frightened when I'm in the dark like this, right? Yes, Sis, I'm also scared here alone. Citra. Say something, Cit, don't be silent. What must I say, Sis? Whatever. Up to you. Citra? Citra? Don't be silent, Citra. I'm scared! Citra! There's a snake here, Sis. Snake? Throw it, throw it! Hey! Hurry up. Siska! Siska! Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. / Sis, hold on! Not you! If you go down, who will help me pulling up? Then who else? Citra! Let Citra go down! Raise your hand, your hand. Hold on, Sis! Slowly, slowly. Hold it, hold it first. You hold me. I'll hold you. Watch out. Citra, hurry up. I'm scared. Citra. Citra! Here, I'm pulling you out! Come on, Siska. Hurry up, Citra. Randu, pull, Ran! Sal, pull, pull, pull. Pull! Pull, pull! Hold me, Cit! Pull out quick! Siska! Lift her using your hands! Hold my hand! What's wrong with you two? Untie it, untie it. We must get out of here, quick! Come on, hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Watch out, be careful. Watch out, be careful. What the hell happened to our tent, Ran? All of our things are gone! We are trapped on this island. Who the hell did all this? Randu, I wanna go home, Ndu. I don't wanna die here. My feet really hurts. It seems that ... ... somebody wants to finish us here. If we're not killed ... ... then we're left to die because we can't survive here. What do you mean? We must get out of here. We must. Randu! Ran! Randu, Sally, wait! What are you doing? I want to swim far away from here! Because I don't wanna die on this island! You coming with me? I'm coming with you. But you're not really a good swimmer. Not like Randu. I'd rather die trying to survive ... ... than die in vain on this island, Sis! Then what about me? Ndu, no, I'm scared. Enough, enough! We all go swimming then! Come on! I'll help you, okay? Come on! Come on, come on! Siska! Siska! Help! Help! Pull. Pull. CPR, CPR, Sal! CPR, Sal! Siska, wake up. Wake her up. Somebody has pulled my leg. I'm scared, I wanna go home! Calm down! Siska! We can't go home! We're holding out here until the boat man comes to pick us up the day after tomorrow. Okay? Calm down. Calm down. We must find a shelter. Come on. Lift her up. Lift her up, lift her up. Lift her up. Calm her down, calm her down. Just calm her down. Calm her down. Carry her. Come on. Okay. Looks like ... ... tonight ... ... we're staying here. It's safer. Sal. You really have no idea that this island is eerie? No, I haven't. I know this island from the internet. Browsing. Internet? Didn't you say that you know this island from the tour guide? Internet? Browsing? You take a vacation to a strange place ... ... just by relying on your internet browsing? Do you realize how many lives you bring, huh? How could you, Sal? Jubed is gone because of you. How can I be responsible to that, Sal? What must I tell his family in Jakarta? He's my boyfriend after all, Sal. Hey, don't dramatize this, okay? We all know why you go steady with Jubed. So stop being a drama queen! Sally, hey. No need to argue, okay? It won't reduce your responsibility for losing a man's life! But I'm really not aware of all that, Ndu! Yes, but you're already losing a man's life, okay? I'm sure you're lying. I'm sure you don't know it from the internet. I ... ... go here ... ... just to have a vacation with you all! I must obtain this. But how? I know how. I know. Sally! Sal! Sally! Sally! Sally! Sally! We better split up. If we gather like this ... ... we move slow. We won't find her. Okay? To be honest, I'm scared, Ran. But ... Fine, let's just split up, okay? Let's go. How can we split up? I can't go far. What more can we do? You wanna stay here alone? Do you? You better go with me. Well? We'll walk slowly, okay? Come on. All right, Cit. You take care of her, okay? You go that way ... ... and I'll go that way, okay? Okay. Be careful, Ran. You too. Sally! Sally! Sally! Sally! Dammit, Cit. Dammit, Cit, I'm so tired. Let's take a break first, okay? Okay, let's rest over there. But just one moment, okay? Cit, Cit. There's a boat. Don't you see that the boat is broken? It's also rusted. It means we're not the only ones here. I hope so, Sis. Let's continue, shall we? Be careful. Sally! Sally! Be careful. Sally! Sally! Sally! Sally! Sally! Sal! Look out. Be careful. Sally! Citra. Cit, what is that? Citra. Cit ... Citra. I'm scared, Cit. I'm scared! Come on, Sis, quick, we must go! Stand up quick, quick! Siska, wake up. Siska, wake up, quick. Siska! Then what ... ... must we do now? Run! Citra, wait for me! Sal, where have you been? I was out for a while then I got lost! You make everybody panic, you know that? I thought you were mad at me. That's why I left. You're a troublemaker! Hurry up. Hurry up! You wanna get eaten by King Tail? You really have no heart! Quick! Sal. What's that? Huh? What is that? Randu! Help! Help! Help! Help me, Cit! Quick! Go up quick. Siska! Hurry! Hurry! My foot. Siska, stand up quick! Siska! Sally! Siska, hurry! Siska, quick! Hurry! Run! Siska! Siska ... Sally? Sally, wake up, Sal! Siska, wake up, Sis. Siska, wake up! Where am I? We're still on this island, Sis. We've gotta get out of here fast! Sally, hurry up, Sal! We've gotta get out of here fast! Come on. Come on. Come on. Go on. Go on. Go on. Guys, I'm tired. I can't stand it anymore! Let's go on. Come on, Siska. It's all because of you, Sal! I have a feeling I must not go but you push me to! Siska, enough, Sis. We've gotta get going! We must keep on going. Hurry up, Sally, hurry up! Citra! Please don't cry! You drive me crazy with your cry! Why are you mad at me? All I can do now is crying, you know? Can't you see that three of us are trapped in here? But if you're crying you won't solve the problem! It makes your brain blunt instead, you know? Sal, be honest with me. Why are you taking us to this island? Sally! I told you ... ... before I get married ... ... I want to have a vacation with you all. Bullshit. You know that this island is strange, don't you? Don't you see that our friends have died one by one in a strange way? You know that both Siska's and Randu's feet .... ... were pulled by some strange creature, don't you? Then we found a strange track which was clearly not a human's track! And didn't you see that? Didn't you see? That our pier suddenly fell down? Sal, please be honest with me. Why are you taking us here? What is your purpose? And where did you go last night? Why were you gone? Yes, Sal. Don't you know ... ... that your leaving last night has caused me ... ... Citra and Randu went around looking for you? And that ... ... has caused Jubed to die! And now Randu is dead too! Shut up! Shut up! Okay! Okay! I ... ... just want to find out the truth about the legend of King Tail. That's all! King Tail? This parchment. This is the proof. It was said that if I get this parchment ... ... then I combine it with the one I have ... I'm combining it. If I read the magic formula ... ... King Tail will rise again! So that's what you did when I was cooking? You read the magic formula, Sal, in the tent? Are you insane? King Tail? Who is King Tail? Explain it to me. King Tail was a despotic king. He liked to collect tributes. And also ate human's flesh. That's why all of his people went away. Because they're afraid they would be eaten. Oh, really? You serious? So you mean to say that he will ... ... eat us all? Yes. Because his mother had mated with a dog! Wait a minute. He really has a tail? Yes. And if Sally really resurrect King Tail ... You know that three of us can be his next meal, don't you, Sal? And now ... ... when you find out that King Tail really exists ... ... what will you get? Huh? This surely has got something to do with your antique shop. Citra, I swear. I swear! I just want to know the truth about King Tail, that's all! I don't believe you. There must be something you're looking after. Sal. You've ... you've startled me. I never thought .... ... you're this tricky. You have sacrificed all of your friends ... ... just to get that kind of thing. Thing? You're saying that this is just a thing? For your information ... ... this thing ... ... is worth more than you. You are a psycho! You can say whatever you want. Now I've already gotten what I want. I'm leaving. Sal. Don't you realize what you have done? Run! Cit Help me, Cit. Why must I help you? Didn't you say that that thing was worth more than me? Help me, please, it hurts. Help ... One ... ... two ... ... three! Help! Siska? Help me, I wanna get down! Siska! Siska! Cit, help! Citra, help me! I want to get down! Citra, help me! Citra, hurry, I'm scared. Sally, help me, Sal! Sal, hurry up. I'm scared, I want to get down. Siska! Come on. Right. Go on! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
