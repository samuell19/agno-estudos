Investigation Evidence Dodo Rozak Are you sure you really want to do this? It's about time. Lots of people are going to get hurt. I can't back down anymore. I've been waiting for this moment for seventeen years. Whatever happens... I'll always have your back. Thank you. I'm picking up a lot of negative auras... coming from a lot of stabbing, sharp edges from all angles. And that's what's been making you sick lately. No, Master. I feel fine. Then... You're just having a bit of bad luck. Yeah, it's bad luck. You're having trouble getting a job. Not really. I have many clients and most of them are high class. So I'm not having any financial problems. Okay, then you must be here because you're seeking love. Am I right? Not really. I haven't really thought about dating, let alone marriage. Then why are you here? Just for a visit? To meet Master Jaki? World famous King of Fengshui? I don't get it. I just came to show you this. You... You're Kartika? That cute little Kartika who likes to do this? Kartika, I've missed you so much! I'm so happy to see you! What brings you here? Madonna, come here and meet your sister! - Madonna? That Madonna? - Yeah. Hi, Madonna! I was with your dad when you were born. I even know why your name is Madonna. Because your dad believed that one day you'll become a famous singer! She's right. But you know, sometimes dreams can be far from reality. But don't worry, keep on believing! How are you? How did you get here? Gepeng. Come here. Hey, Bewok! You, too. What did I do? Can't you see you're doing it wrong? You're just chanting randomly. Use your voice! Yes. - Astagfirullah. - Astagfirullah... - Wait, what are you reading? - Look! Oh my God. I think she's the Angel of Death, come to get Mr. Japra. - An angel? - It's his time. Oh my God. Sir, look. Oh my lord. - Come here. - No! But you've repented. So your soul will be accepted. I'm not scared! No, you first! Mr. Japra! - Kartika! - Kartika! - Kartika! - What are you doing? Remember what he said, she's not your mahram. No, you can't! Let me. - Kartika! - You're still the same. Children, she's part of my family. She's my daughter. She's mahram? I'm Bewok. Kartika! Hi! Look, she's the prettiest lawyer, ever. Bule! Let me guess, you are busy hacking into celebrities' account? No, I'm a changed man. Shake my hand. - I police cybercrime now. - Cybercrime? Are you selling ice "crime"? That's ice cream! That's different! You haven't changed a bit. How are you, Japra? Jaki? How are you guys? You should stop by the office sometime. You mean, the penitentiary? No, thank you, sir. Well, maybe I'll just stop by at the front. Your office is so hot. Stay in a prison cell, if you want to cold. The review hearing for the criminal case... of the murder and sexual abuse of Melati Wibisono... by the defendant, Dodo Rozak, is in session. On March 22, 2002... Mr. Dodo Rozak committed a home invasion. But that's not all. The defendant was also involved in the vicious murder... and sexual abuse of Melati Wibisono in the backyard of her house... and used a wooden pole to bludgeon the victim to death. Everything was legitimately proven at trial. Therefore, no further hearings are required to determine what is clear guilt. Thank you, Your Honor. Now let's hear from the defense counselor. The prosecutor claims the ruling is legitimate. Based on the trial and strong evidence. But that's actually where the problems begin, Your Honor. The trial was anything but lawful. The evidence presented doesn't support the actual facts of the event. On what basis do you make that statement? I can say that because I am also a witness, Your Honor. The time I spent with the defendant is an irrefutable truth. You were there? Yes. I was there. Looking everywhere For a blossoming flower I forgot! Swinging around On a feeble twig Look, we're chasing a train! We're chasing a train! - Kartika, my girl! - Yes, Daddy Dodo! - Are you ready to fly? - I am! One, two, three! We're flying! We're flying! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Look, I don't care. You have to be here. There's no excuse for that. I've cancelled all my plans! - Hold onto them tight. - Okay. I cancelled everything because our daughter keeps asking for something. How long until the decorations are finished? Here you go, eighty-five thousand. It's ninety-five thousand. Okay, how about I give you some cake to make up the ten thousand? Look, this is pink. I don't care. You have to come home. Mr. Warno, what's that rope for? It's for tying up the decorations. After the party, please tidy that up. I almost tripped on it. Yes, ma'am. Mom! Bonnie is gone! She was playing with me in my room, but then she ran away. I can't find her anywhere. Alright, we'll look for her later. But you have to take a shower now. No, help me look for her. Alright. Mr. Warno, can you look for her dog, Bonnie? Yes, ma'am. Bonnie. Bonnie. Look, there's a dog! Don't go out! Sir! Sir! The dog! Bonnie! Little girl! Your dog! Someone ran over her. Mom, Bonnie is hurt! - What happened? - The dog went outside... - What did you do to my dog? - It's wasn't me. - What did you do? - No, no, no... Mr. Warno! Come here, quick! Hurry! Grab her. She's already dead. You killed my dog? Stay away from my daughter! Stay away from my daughter! Who the hell are you? Get him out of here! Bring her to a vet. She needs to see a doctor... Bonnie. That poor dog. Get her to a doctor. Dad, let's just go home. No. Manggis Road, Gang 4 No. 7. Phone number 021... Let's go get Mom's favourite food. Do you what it is? Egg martabak! Her favourite martabak with two duck eggs, with crispy shell... - Wait for 10 minutes, then it's done. - Get out of here. Martabak! - Is it done? - Yes, here it is, Do. Kartika, pay him. Thank you, little girl. - Thank you. - Bye. Take care. - Come on, Dad! - Can you help me? Come on! Hurry up, Dad. Hi. Look, I made you some soup. It's your favourite, right? Thanks, Mrs. Ani. Smells good. Thank you, Mrs. Ani. - Do you want the bowl or plate? - Give me the plate. Don't forget the martabak. Fly! Fly! Wait, don't mix it with white shirts, it could ruin. What... You're smart. I am... Smart! If you happy and you know it, squeeze again! If you happy and you know it, waggle it! If you're happy and you know it then your face will surely show it A train! Mommy said, if your clothes are wet... Change into dry ones. - So you won't get sick. - So you won't catch a cold. - Short sleeves or the long sleeves? - Short sleeves. If you want to be a doctor, you have to study. This is your homework. Short or long? Long. Kartika. If you're working on something, you have to finish it, okay? Yes, Dad. Don't forget. May 7th is your birthday. May 7th is my birthday. I want martabak for a present. With three duck eggs. Okay. Can you tell me the story about how you met Mom again? Once upon a time... I was living in an orphanage. I met Juwita, and I called her Uwi. Mommy Uwi was so nice to me, so I liked her. I loved her so much. And somehow her father knew about that. And then he had us get married. The next day... Mommy Uwi became a nurse. And suddenly, her belly got so big. It was so big because there was a baby inside. I told you to wait 'til after the rain. Look at you all drenched like this. Let me get you a change of clothes. If your clothes get wet, you have into change dry ones. Or you might catch a cold. When she grows up... she'll be a nurse, like her mother. Kartika should become a doctor, not just a nurse. Whoa, a doctor? You're going to be a doctor? And the next day... the baby came out, crying. Ika Kartika Rozak. But then Mommy was sick. She was bleeding a lot. And then she left us. She flew away to heaven. I love you so much. Someday... we will fly together to see Mommy again. You have to be strong! - Ika, help me. - Let's go, Dad! Push! Push! Run! Mr. Salam! Bye! Come on, Ika! Your backpack. Your bag, Dad. Don't forget to eat the martabak. I brought you dry clothes and a jacket. If your clothes get wet, you have to change them. - Bye! - Bye! One, two, three! Don't forget to study hard! Be careful! Don't stay out in the rain! Don't forget to eat! - Don't forget to pick me up! - Bye! Wow, martabak! Bonnie... Bonnie... Bonnie... Take it. It's your birthday. Don't cry. You have to be happy. You're bleeding! Oh my God! Warno! She's bleeding. She's going to get sick. Change her clothes! Melati! Oh my God! Kartika, you're still here? Get out! Look at the camera, sir! Police have arrested a man suspected of murdering a seven-year-old girl. Melati Wibisono... daughter of the chairman of the National Development Party, Willy Wibisono. The man with the initials DR, is now considered the police's main suspect... Mrs. Sandy. Expedite the process. That man needs to be hanged. Yes, sir. No! I want to go home! I have to pick up Kartika.

Now hold this. - No! - Where did you hit her? - I didn't do it! Hit him! Take note of this. He hit her in the head. Listen! You took off her clothes and then you raped her, didn't you? - I want to go home! - If you want to go home, then do it already! I want to go home! I want to go home! And then you walked over here. You were trying to kill this woman? He was trying to kill you, right? Tell us the truth. Write it down. He was trying to kill her. And then you saved her, right? By hitting him?

Ika! We can't let this happen. They'll put us in isolation or in detention. Do you want to stay here forever? It's only for two hours. When the Ustad leaves, she's going back with them. You're insane. Mr. Agus is here. Mr. Agus! - No! - Mr. Agus! Jaki, stop! Shut your mouth! You just disrupted me, you know? Stay, stay, stay! You know what that means? Quiet. You're crying now?

What happened to your hand? Nothing. I'm fine. Ms. Widi wants to talk to you. Ms. Widi, thank you so much for taking her here. Yeah. Ika is doing great in school. I know she is. She is going to be a doctor. Not a nurse. - Really? - A doctor! She wants to be a doctor! No wonder she always gets good grades on her exams. - Ika! - She is also in the school choir. - Choir? - It's a singing group with her classmates. - You're a singer? - Yes, she is.

I'll come home tomorrow! - I want to stay in the cell with you! - Don't forget to eat! Don't go out in the rain! I'm coming home tomorrow! Lin. I'm coming home tonight. After a long time in mourning, today, Willy Wibisono... is announcing his run for governor of our beloved city. Let's ask him about his mission. What happened to our daughter... who passed away on her birthday... makes me even more determined to uphold justice in this city. There will be no parole for any criminal acts against children. Right. Stand right here. Dodo is here, sir. Dodo. Is it true? You murdered Melati Wibisono? Mommy Uwi told me once... I have to treat people nicely. So people will treat me nice, too. I can't be a bad guy. I wasn't a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. I can't. We have a delivery from the prison warden. It's a special one, for you. - No, I don't want it. - You have to see this. Let's open it up. - This looks amazing. - No, I don't want it. Fine, let's return this to him. - Alright, let's close it. - Let's call Mr. Hendro. - You're a second too late. - Tell him Dodo doesn't want it. - Daddy! - Ika! You know we could lose our jobs. No one will ever find out... if none of us talks. Mr. Foreman. Ika wants you to tell her a story. But... But you have Gepeng and Bewok here, or Bule. Okay, fine. So there's these two kids... - one in a red shirt, the other in white. - Wait. That's not how you read it. The kid in... Who's reading the story here? I can read however I like. Can you read the title first? Okay. "Ba..." "Wa... Ng." "Bawang." "Me..." "Bawang Merah, Bawang Putih." - Yeah, I know. - Just admit you can't read. Can you believe some people still can't read these days? - For sure! That man is bald. - With a soft skull. - And a potbelly. - And a beard. Hey! Mr. Japra, please. I really want to see my baby. Look, my wife is pregnant and she's going into labour next week. I really want to see my baby. Can you help me, please? - Sure, why not? - Really? Yeah, after they did this to you. What's that? It's when you have sweat around your neck, this is how you wipe it. See? Sir? Mr. Hendro? It's done, sir. But I saw something odd in it, sir. There is no way Dodo would say something like that. Look, I believe this is a conspiracy within the department. Look at that name, Willy Wibisono. Isn't he running for governor? He could've paid the police and... I'm sorry, sir. Thank you, Mr. Agus. Give her your hand. - You're welcome. - Thank you, Mr. Achmad. You're welcome, Kartika. - Close the door. - Yes, sir. Hi, sweetie. I've made your favourite veggie soup. Let's eat together. Yes, Mom. The girl is here. She is so sweet. I'll call you later, okay? Bye. Kartika, just put the dishes here. I can do them myself. You said you have to do your homework with Uncle's help? Daddy Dodo said when you're working on something, you have to finish it. Auntie, can I borrow your phone? Who are you going to call? How come you can't you read this? - You can't read any of this. - Right. You're too old for this. I know. But I still have the strong will to learn. - And who is Hanung, anyway? - He's my friend. Who even knows who that is? That's the thing. I don't know who that person is. - Write down the name of someone we know. - Give me one more. This is learning how to read, not getting to know someone. - How about this? - Okay. Here. That's easy. You're helpless if you can't read this one. This is so you. - This is you. - Okay. Om... That's great. Okay, continue. - The paper. - Where's the word? Om... Om... Japra! Oh my God. Jancuk! Dodo! You must never said that word. That's not a nice word, okay? Jaki, what is wrong with you? It's Meta... Meta's having the baby today. Hey, Jaki. She's the one having a baby. So why are you the one crying? But I'm her husband. I should be there with her. That's why you shouldn't scam people. Use this. A phone? Nothing here. Still nothing... What are you guys looking for? What are you doing? Where should I look? Near the window... - You got it? - I got it! Call her! But how can I talk? Bewok, Bule, get down here. Climb up. Lower your voice! So heavy! Hello? Who is this? Hello, it's me, Jaki! Is it really you? Yes, this is your husband! Whose phone is this? It's not important, honey. As long as I can call you. - How's our baby? - She's already born. It's a girl! Wanna hear her voice? Her voice is so beautiful. Let me hear it. I need a name. Give me a girl's name. How about this? Combine yours and your wife's name. Yeah, good idea. Meta, Jaki... Me... Ssh! What's wrong with the name "Meja"? I can't name her Meja. She's not a table. Look, your favourite singer. Use her name. That's right. Let's name her Madonna. Madonna? Yes! Don't you have any other names? An Indonesian name, maybe? Because Madonna's stayed pretty, from her youth all the way to old age. And don't forget, it has two N's in it. Listen, Dodo. Prison life is tough. We have to work out regularly. Yeah, your punches have to be fast and strong. Idiot! You're lucky it was me. Come here. Switch places. You're over there. Look, your punch has to be strong. Like this. Like that? It's my turn, Bewok! Switch again. Dodo. You did it! Your appeal has been granted. What? They even set the trial date already. Mr. Achmad. Who filed the appeal? Mr. Hendro! If he's found not guilty. He's out of here forever. Amen. Congratulations, Do. But you still have to be tough while you're in prison. Prison life is tough. That's enough. Listen, we need to prepare Dodo for his trial. I'll teach him how to twist the truth a little. Why twist it if he's not the real killer? If he isn't, then we have to know what actually happened. We at least need a case file. How do we get it? You can leave that to me. We're lucky to have a shaker in our team. - "Shaker"? - "Shaker"? It's waker! "Waker"? You morons! We're talking computer stuff. What is it, then? Printer! - Printer? - Fine, printer it is. Of course it is. I finished school all the way to fourth grade. Elementary school? Isn't fourth grade in middle school? I have no idea. I was pretty much born in prison. Then go to school, so you can be smart like me. What are you doing here? Just checking the antivirus. I'm not sure it's working. Look, there's a new virus in here. - What new virus? - Look. What the... - Where did all these pictures come from? - Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. - What do you mean? This isn't mine! - Look, there are others... No! Just delete that! - You don't want to look? - No! Delete that! Yes, sir. So I printed out some pictures. IO photos, scene photos, and news articles. This one reads... "The murder suspect Dodo Rozak, chased down the victim... Melati Wibisono, into her backyard." - Dodo. Pay attention to him. - Stay focused. I have to make some balloons. Okay, that can wait. Pay attention to this. Gepeng, you act as Dodo. Jaki, you be Melati. Melati! Dodo, you chase Melati. You little brat, how can you grow a beard like that? Faster! - Stop. - No... I never chased her. - You didn't? - She ran by herself. Melati ran alone. Act like you're threatened. - Do. - And then? - An explosion? A bomb? - No. Lightning strikes? I think it has something to do with this pool. - Do you mean a splash? - She was in the pool? The swimming pool. Alright, so she is in the water. Draw a picture of a pool, here. Draw a pool, here. Move away, or you'll drown. Move. Okay, this is the pool. Melati, you're swimming. No. She wasn't moving. Wasn't moving? - What are you doing? - Stay. She was floating? - Maybe she was dead already. - She was hurt. Hurt, you mean like this? There was a blood. What did you do with this pole? Hit her? - Find something as a prop. - A pole. Give it to me. Here you go. She was pretty far in the middle, so I grabbed a pole... I couldn't reach her. So I... So you dove in? And you were helping her. You brought her to the side. What are you doing to me? - She was wet. - Yes, she came out of the pool. No, she was wet. Okay, I got it. Okay, soak him with water. You mean wet like this? What are you doing with her clothes? Were you trying to rape her? No. Mommy Uwi said if your clothes get wet, you have to change them. Or you can catch a cold. I think I got it. There must be a reason why Melati was in that pool. You see this rope near the table? A rope, here? So what happened was... Melati tripped on this rope. And then she fell. And she hit her head on the table. That's why she was bleeding... and then she fell into the pool. - Little girl? - And this... The wooden pole was to help her. Not to hit her. So Dodo never hurt Melati. Help! Just look at him. He does that all the time. He even tries to take men's clothes off. Just because they're wet. What did Mommy Uwi tell you? Change your wet clothes for dry ones. You can't stay wet like that. You can catch a cold. You have to take them off. Don't get sick! Somebody, help! That means Dodo didn't kill or even try to rape her. Right? Do. Dodo, listen. Stand up. You are innocent, okay? We are here to stand up for you. We're going to do everything we can. Thank you, everyone. I object, Your Honor. The defense is only presenting her personal story as evidence. If we should refer to that to change the verdict... and let a child rapist and a murderer go free... that will surely damage the supremacy of law in this country. Therefore, the defense testimony is irrelevant. Irrelevant, you say? Fine. I will now call another witness... who saw me with Dodo Rozak during his time in prison. Your Honor, permission to call my witness. Please. The Warden of Mahameru Penitentiary, Mr. Hendro Sanusi. Would you please step forward? Mr. Sanusi. Please tell us what you know about Dodo Rozak's case. Thank you. The ruling of this appeal... will be harmful to your future, Mr. Hendro. We both serve this country, Mr. Willy. It is our duty to act righteously. Mr. Hendro... You don't know what it feels like to lose a child. My daughter... My daughter's life was cut short, like yours. I know how it feels, sir. I know how it feels. The difference is, I don't abuse my power to get my revenge. Alright, by saying bismillah... this trial is now in session. Mr. Prosecutor, please state the charges. Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Dodo. Is it true that you murdered Melati Wibisono? So I made a balloon dog, and I... Hey! Just read it. - It's blank. - Not this one. That one from Bule. - Yeah, that's it. - Read that. I never harmed Melati. She fell into the swimming pool after she hit her head on the table. That's more like it. If you can memorize that, you could win this trial. - Memorize? - Yeah, memorize that. Louder. I was afraid when they told me to confess that I did it. They said if I signed the papers, they will send me home to see Kartika. So that report was floss. "False". - Floss. - False. - Floss! - False! "So the report was floss." You idiot! You spelled the word wrong! I'm sorry. - Order! order! - I'm sorry! The court is adjourned, now... Hey. Come out here. Not all of you. Just Dodo. Your attorney is here. Your defense counselor is here. - Is Kartika coming too? - No, she's not. Bye! Dodo, listen to me. I want you to listen, Dodo. Melati's father. Mr. Willy, is a really powerful man. He is a prominent figure. So he could do anything to make you pay for his daughter's death. Mr. Ruslan, please wait. I want to show you the petition from our inmates to review Dodo's case. I hope this helps. Mr. Hendro. Unfortunately this won't be of any help at all. Sorry, what do you mean? Aren't you going to do your best to defend him, or... Mr. Hendro, we are facing tough opposition. So I would suggest you reconsider your appeal. Wait. Have you read the police investigation report? Read it again carefully. Do you think a person like Dodo could write perfectly, like this? I understand, Mr. Hendro. But trust me. It's useless. Wait! You are an official attorney of this penitentiary. I am begging for your help. Mr. Hendro... That is exactly why I'm thinking about my own future well being. I hope you do so, too. You're unlocking it? Stay focused. Think about Kartika. - Ika. - Yes. - I want to go home sir. - Yes, you will. I want to take care of Ika. You will, soon. Remember... This is the key. Remember? Yes, sir. I did not kill Melati. Melati fell into the swimming pool when she hit her head on the table. Mr. Dodo Rozak... is it true... that you murdered Melati Wibisono? Mr. Willy is a really powerful man. And he can do anything to make you pay for his daughter's death. Sacrifices have to be made. Including even your life. Dodo, listen! If you want Kartika to live, and have a future... you have to think about her. She is your daughter! I will repeat my question, Mr. Dodo Rozak. Is it true? That you murdered Melati? That's mine. Listen! If you walk out a free man... Kartika will die. Don't. Ika can't die. Please... Please don't. Please answer the prosecutor's question. Yes, sir. I murdered Melati. Murderer! Order. Please answer that question louder. This is no time for jokes. Yes, I murdered her! - Murderer! - Order! Mr. Dodo, don't play games. Answer truthfully. I murdered Melati, Your Honor. Your Honor. The defendant is being coerced. Mr. Ruslan, you are his counselor, please do something! Why don't you do something? Your Honor, he is not guilty. My dad is not guilty! Dodo, you have to tell them the truth. Remember Kartika. Yes, I murdered her. Your Honor, please listen to me. The defendant is a person with a disability. And he is being coerced! Do you really think it's possible that he killed her? Dodo, tell them the truth! Dodo Rozak! Dad, this is not your fault. Your Honor. The police relied only on a witness's statement... without even acknowledging the suspect's denials. The confession was coerced, Your Honor. Melati was not murdered by Mr. Dodo Rozak. Her death was an accident. She hit her head on the table and fell into the swimming pool. There is not a shred of evidence showing any violence committed against her. The autopsy results didn't show any blunt force trauma the witness claimed. The investigation was completely biased. Every single person was forced to point to him as the murderer. You... Mr. Counselor. Why didn't you do something? Answer me! Why didn't you do something? There was no presumption of innocence provided at the trial. No one even considered Mr. Dodo's mental condition. Counselor, do you have anything to say? Your Honor... I would like to apply for leniency on his behalf. The defendant has admitted to his actions. We request the defendant face the original sentence set in the first trial. Since the defendant... has confessed to his actions. The sentence... stands. Thank you, sir. Thank you. I am here to defend a man who was wrongfully accused. I want to defend him with everything I can. I want to defend him. - I want to defend my father. - Kartika... I want to defend my father. She should become a doctor. I want to defend my father. I'm sorry, Mommy Uwi. Please forgive me. You've been fasting all day, every day this week. You haven't missed a single day. If you can keep this up all month, we'll go on a vacation. - Right, honey? - Yes. Is there any place you want? To the beach, or the mountains? Anywhere, as long as Daddy Dodo can come with me. Ika. Ika is on vacation. Ika. Bye, Ika! We are going to fly. Fly so high. Ika, I will make a balloon so we can fly. Excuse me, sir. How's the pardon for Dodo going? Two days before Eid al-Fitr... Dodo will be transferred to Nusa Kambangan Island. His execution will take place there. Let's go. Mr. Hendro is looking for you. Mr. Foreman! I will take you all to fly! Okay! So high! Mr. Hendro. Bule. Everyone, gather around. We have to get Dodo out of here no matter what. How can we do that? We're surrounded with walls and guards. They might shoot him. Relax. This is how. And he will help us... Mr. Agus is coming! - This is from top to bottom. - Okay. Keep up the good work. Keep an eye out. This is how we do it. Thank you, Ustad Rahman bin Abdullah for the prayer. Ramadan is a month of forgiveness. And I hope Allah will forgive all of us in here, today. And now, please welcome the choir from Ciliwung Elementary School. Please give them a round of applause. I know, I know. - Let's go. - Where? - We're going to fly. - Is Ika coming with us? Yes, she's coming. You said you want to fly with her, right? Then let's go. - Hey, where are you going? - We need to use the bathroom. We're going to see Daddy Dodo. Hurry! Dodo, come on. Over there, Dodo. There's a door, Do. You're not coming? We're staying here. We'll be waiting for your letters. Send us pictures when you get there. Don't forget about us when you grow up. Honey, remember, if you're happy and you know it? - Clap your hands! - Clap your hands! We're not going to see each other again? Do. Fly high, Dodo. Okay, that's enough. Gepeng, take off the line, or we're going to get caught. Hey! Hurry, Gepeng! - We're going to fly! - What are you guys doing? Check everywhere. - Move it! - Hurry, Gepeng! We're flying! Bye, Dodo! We're flying! Take care! We're flying! Stop! - Stop! - We're flying! Agus! Hurry! - It's stuck! - Let me get it! Bye, everyone! Stop! Don't shoot! Sir! What if they make it out? Calm down. We're flying. Stop right there! Don't move! Gepeng. Get down. We're flying! They won't go anywhere. - Ika. - Yes? - Don't ever forget, okay? - Forget about what? Don't forget about today. Don't forget about me. Bye! We're going to fly now. - Bye! - Bye! Are you ready? Time to go. Dodo. Sir. Sir? Open the door. Let me fix that. Get me something to write with. Don't forget about us, Do. Help me write. What do you want to write? Goodbye G-O... It's tickly. O... - And then? - D... Let me do it. I can't do this. Goodbye, Dodo Thank you, everyone. My friends. Don't forget about us. We will never forget you. I'm hugging him, sir. - Bye. - Bye, Dodo. - Goodbye, Dodo. - Take care of yourself. Goodbye, Dodo. Dodo! Fly high! Fly as high as you can! Dodo! Dodo! Uncle Hendro said you're going somewhere far away? - My daughter, Kartika. - Yes, Daddy Dodo? I love you so much. I love you too, Dad. Ika, you must behave yourself, okay? You have to be a nice person like your mother. So people will be nice to you. You have to be an honest person. Are you going away for long? What if I miss you? Why so many kisses? You should save them in case you miss me, someday. Okay, that's enough. Time to go. If you're happy and you know it clap your hands If you're happy and you know it clap your hands If you're happy and you know it then your face will surely show it - Bye, Ika! - Bye, Dad! - Study hard! - Don't forget to eat! One, two, three! Don't forget to study! Bye! - Study hard! - Take care! Bye! Don't go out in the rain! One... two... three. Dad! Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Ika! - Dad! - Ika! I'm sorry! Ika! I'm sorry, Ika! Dad! - Dad! - I'm sorry, Ika! Help me! Help me! Dad! - Dad! - I'm not bad guy! Forgive me! - Dad! - Please, I want to go home! I want to go with you! I want to go home! I already promise to Uwi, to take care you, Ika! To take care you, Ika! - Dad! - I already promise to Uwi! Dad! Forgive me! - Dad! - Forgive me! Ika! - Help! - Dad! - Help! - Dad! Please take care Ika! Dad! I'm not guilty! Dad! I'm here to clear the name of Dodo Rozak. My beloved father. He never forgot where we lived. He lied. So that I would finally let him go... and stop waiting for him. And I didn't turn out to be a doctor, like what he and my mom, Juwita, wanted. Because I chose to become an attorney so I could clear his name. And defend people with mental disabilities, like my father... Who are still being treated unfairly... and not fully accepted by society. Dodo Rozak was never a murderer, Your Honor. He was just a balloon peddler who loved his family too much. The verdict. In the name of justice and Almighty God... The Supreme Court has re-examined the criminal case in an extended review... and has decided as follows. In the case of the convict, Dodo Rozak... born on May 7th, 1974, male. In this public prosecutor's indictment to the District Attorney... we render the following decision. Upon hearing testimonies from witnesses and the plaintiff... we find that Mr. Dodo Rozak is fully exonorated of all charges... in the murder and sexual abuse case of Melati Wibisono. I'm really proud of you. My daughter Kartika! Dad? Bye Ika! I'm flying. Yes, Dad... My daughter Kartika! I love you! Goodbye, Dad. Bye Ika! Bye, Ika! Look, I'm flying! I love you, Ika!
