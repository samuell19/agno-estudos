LAKEDALE STATE COLLEGE FOUNDED IN 1903 LAST EVENT 400 METERS RUN LEE SHERIDAN, FLYING MERCURY OF THE STATE, CHOSEN TO WIN THE DECISIVE RACE It's in the chat, Mr. Sheridan, Lee has already won the race. That's it, boy. My son will win, I bet everything I have on him. That's if I had the money. We have to get the headline ready soon. We are delaying printing. We will only run after receiving the results from Topeka. When Lee wins those rednecks, he'll value State College. Said we have to wait until your son wins the race. What does he think this is, a lottery? Our regular readers will no longer be regulars if you have to wait until Monday to read the Saturday paper. What only worries me is the sponsors. They threatened to cancel the ads if we missed the Saturday train again. That is, today. Our salaries are already due a week ago. Speak again, see if it convinces you. It's not so much for the money... You know how he is, stubborn as a mule. But I will try. We've had a little delay, but we'll be shooting any minute now. No, you're absolutely right, but I guarantee it won't happen again. The newspaper will arrive punctually from now on. Yes, see you later. Dan, your sponsors will let you down if the issue doesn't take the three-way train. He leaves. Can't do that. Besides, they're complaining about back pay. It's not fair. Send them... No, say I'll pay on Monday. Say I apologize for making them wait. This way is better. Now tell us what the headline is for us to run. Very good. Lee Sheridan breaks record. We already have this one in stock. Ent�o use. We can cut the governor's speech... The local farmers may be out of the loop, but their son they know. Lee Sheridan wins at football, Lee Sheridan wins regatta, I always wondered what the other seven were doing while Lee rowed for glory. Listen here Steve.... It could be from Topeka. Al�! Al�, Lee. Hi Dad. They're all in position waiting for me. The world record is 46.4. I don't think I'll break it, but... Listen, Bill is here. Wait until I get back. Hold it. I'll be back in approximately 46 seconds. Hey, Sheridan, are you going to run or not? Calm. Even if it starts tomorrow I would catch up to them. Ah, �? How about, Lee, do you think you're gonna win? If there's someone better than me, they'll go down in history. That's how you talk. Take a look at me. Can you hurry, Sheridan? That's what I intend to do once I shoot. In position. Get ready. Sheridan in second. Run, Read! Come on, Lee, move those legs, you're falling behind. What happened to him? Must have broken his leg. There he goes. Come on, Lee, come on! T� two meters ahead. It's ahead now. Too easy, friend. Too easy. It was magnificent. Hi Dad. Of course I won. 47 seconds exact. Forty-seven seconds? Uncle slow why? How could I break records with these slugs? LEE SHERIDAN -ALMOST- BREAKS RECORD 400 METERS IN -46- 47 SECONDS. What was it, why didn't you break the record? How could he break records with those slugs? How are you, sir? Hi, Sheridan. Did you call? Yes. Sit down. Thanks. Sheridan... Maybe I'm the only person besides your father who believes that the University of Oxford would tolerate him for more than a semester. Oxford? What does this have to do with me? I studied three years at Oxford. I loved it. I still do. Okay, but... I also let myself be fond of other things and one of them is you. Thank you, Mr. Williams. I have nothing against you either. Thank you, Sheridan. Let's get straight to the point. I got you a scholarship to Cardinal College. Where is it? Cardinal is one of the many faculties that make up the University of Oxford. I mean... You mean I'm going to Oxford? Yes. How wonderful. So do you approve of the idea? Of course, that solves everything. Three more years of... Wait, their football is different from ours, isn't it? I think it's partly our fault if your view of education is a little skewed. We allowed the classroom to become an adjunct to the studio. But we managed to put Lakedale on the hot seat, didn't we? You won't have that problem in Oxford. Surely, in the time that remains of these admirable sports You will gradually realize that Oxford is also a center of studies. It's not the studies that worry me. I'm graduating with distinction, don't forget. I hope you stay in Oxford long enough to prove your academic skills. When they see me running or paddling they will beg me to stay. If Oxford and you survive the first shock, it will be a beautiful experience for both of you. I know your father likes it. I had forgotten about that. It was good while it lasted, but I think Cardinal will have to do without me. why? I have to help my father at the newspaper. He worked hard to pay for my college. I know your father very well. I wouldn't want you to miss out on such an opportunity. I will speak to him. No, no. I prefer not. I think college is gone. But it would be fun to teach those soldiers a lesson. Bomb him, Dan. Good Morning. No what are you thinking? Nothing, nothing special. Why did you call me? I have a bank to run. He knows how to work alone. He can sit on his ass here and it's all the same. Speak soon. What's the problem? Actually, I'd like a loan. What size? About two thousand. Two thousand? Have you been doing something stupid... at your age? Just think about it, Ben, as usual. The money is to send Lee to Oxford. what? I don't give a penny to this crazy idea. He has to start working here. Whose son is it? Yours, unfortunately for him. I educate him the way... Spoiled like he is, he won't do anything. He already thinks he owns that college and the whole city. You have to stop being so cocky. And as a parent, it is your duty to do so. You won't tell me what I have to do. Someone has to say. If you still have any sense, you'll send Lee to earn his own money. Get him to sell advertising space for a commission. That will suit him. I don't need to fix him. I know him and the blood that runs through his veins. What's blood got to do with it? What does blood have to do with it? It's one thing. The first Sheridan to set foot in this country was in 1675 bringing with him a typographer. And since then that's what all Sheridans have lived and died. And they die of old age, around 85. Lee is a Sheridan, so he still has about 62 years left. Enough time to settle debts with people like you, short-lived failures that we don't know how hard to deal with. The boy has blue blood in his veins. And do you know why it's blue? Printing ink, which will end up showing when the time comes. He will show service like all the Sheridans before him. And even better, because you will receive a better education. And talk about fixing it. Get the hell out of here. Go back behind the bars of your bank where you belong. That's right, Dan, I'm leaving. Do you want the two thousand in cash or check? LEE SHERIDAN GOES TO OXFORD Guys, wait a�! We rooted enough for old Lee. But this will be the last time, so let's make sure he never forgets. L-A-K-E-D-A-L-E L-A-K-E-D-A-L-E L-A-K-E-D-A-L-E Sheridan. Sheridan. Sheeee-ridan. O-X-F-O-R-D O-X-F-O-R-D Cheerio. Dear colonists... my stay in your country has been excellent seeing their peculiar customs up close meeting the natives and learning their language. But now that I need to get back to civilization... Hey, I forgot to say goodbye to my dad... let me through. Father, I'm sorry. I didn't know it was already so late. I want to talk to you. You'll have enough time when you get back. Don't forget to always write. I have a column reserved for the newspaper. Don't miss out on us, Lee. And how could he, after all he's done. I even wish Dad hadn't taken out that loan. Don't worry. I'll make up for it by beating him at poker. Goodbye, Lee. Goodbye, Mr. Williams. Thanks for everything. Remember that Oxford is old, don't try to change it too much. At least as soon as it arrives. The time has come. Go, otherwise you miss the train. Don't worry. Go, son. Extra! Extra! Read everything. Multid�o says goodbye to Lee Sheridan! At least today your newspaper was not late. Excuse me, how long is it to Oxford? In just under an hour. Not bad for those little English trains. We are quite satisfied with them. In fact, they have to be small. The country is small. It would fit all state of Nebraska. No doubt. But to what end? Please don't misunderstand me. Not a criticism, your country is very nice. I'm going to Oxford. I am very happy to go to Oxford. At first it might seem a bit stagnant to me, but I'll get used to it. Listen up, friends. Seems interesting. My dean told me not to try to move Oxford right away. I will follow your advice. It's good to know that. How many colleges are there in Oxford? I couldn't say. Do you know how many students there are? My young man, any information concerning the University of Oxford, old buildings of Oxford, climate and topography of Oxford, can be obtained from the official Oxford guide. And I must add that I was lucky enough to graduate from Cambridge. Good afternoon. He heard? Looks like some college is in for a nice surprise. Cross your fingers, it could be Cardinal. God forgive me. What about Paul, good news for Cardinal? No, our human material is the weakest of all. Before we had a good runner or rower. Do we really need to talk about such a boring subject? Of course, you are above these things. None of that. I just think it's obvious that some run faster than others. That's the problem, ours don't run. Sorry to interrupt, but I have good news for you. How? I happen to be an athlete and I'm on my way to Cardinal. He's going to Cardinal. We should have noticed. How lucky we found each other. Providential. It's nice to have someone to talk to. My name is Lee Sheridan, I'm American. I see you're worried about the races. Well, you can rest easy, that's when I come in. How great. What do you do? Before leaving I won the 400m in 47. 47? I imagine it's seconds. Exactly, and it wasn't even tight. I don't see him in grips. This was good. What is your name? Sorry, unforgivable on my part. I'm Paul Beaumont. How are you? Sr. Ramsey, Sr. Wavertree. Como v�o? Sr. Lee Sheridan, da Am�rica ... It certainly does more than run. Yes Soccer. How is your football? We have two types, rugger and soccer. Do you know how to play either one? Or both? No, I only know how to play football. It is like. I got two touchdowns a game last season. Must be quite an athlete. You can say. A gift from the gods. We could use it in rowing too. Too bad he's not a rower. I only rowed three years for Lakedale, nothing more. He could have made it to the Olympics, but he lacked a sponsor. You must certainly suffer from moments of extreme tiredness. Our Eton rowers will be able to help you a lot. I can't imagine those guys paddling with their stiff collars. Your college must miss you terribly. No, they're all very nice. They said goodbye with the band and everything. Gang? From Paul Whiteman, by any chance? Wait, what is it called? Lee Sheridan. Lee Sheridan? How much distraction, voc� � or Sheridan. Why didn't you just say so? The Sheridan for whom the faculty prepared the party at the station. Of course, Sheridan. That Sheridan. Will you welcome me with a party? Of course, it was in all the papers. Ah, it can only be my dad's doing, the smart-ass. It would be better if he didn't show up. As well? I'll tell you something. Whenever an athlete is received in this way he ends up becoming unpopular in the other faculties. It gives the impression that we are bragging. It starts to be seen as the devil himself. Many had to interrupt their studies because of this. But if they're waiting for me, I can't help it. Yes he has. Take my advice and jump into Didcot. Where is it? A station near Oxford. But won't they be resentful? Now, have you ever seen anyone reproached for his modesty? Maybe they're right. If you want it that way, fine. Ah, the fairest of the Beaumonts. Ol�. Ol�, Molly. Sit down, I won't be long. Meet Mr. Sheridan. My sister. Very pleased to meet you. How are you? You're American, aren't you? Yes, how did you guess? Sixth sense, perhaps. Mr. Sheridan is a famous athlete. Maybe you've heard of it. Sorry, but I don't think so. Studies Ancient History at Oxford. You only know people who are over 300 years old. Things are getting better. I didn't know there were such beautiful students. Thanks. There's something much better. Miserable. They're too young. They don't know how to appreciate women. Well, then you've just found one you like. Tell me, do you have time to shake? shake? G�ria to date, court, walk hand in hand with a boyfriend. I don't think I've done much of that yet. Well, you should try it. End up getting addicted. You're in luck, Molly. You'll see he's a lot of fun. Certainly. Look, this is where you jump. Ah yes. I think we'll have to part ways. I thought you were going to Oxford. And I will, but through the back door. I want to avoid the reception. Yes, Molly. In his honor. And you are absolutely right. Too bad not to continue the trip. See you later. To avoid disagreements, wouldn't it be better to go together? Good idea. You're making a mistake, Sheridan. Then don't say we didn't warn you. It will be a moment of pleasure and the rest of your life to regret. I'm right. See you later. See you soon. See you soon. I'll talk to the beacons. What are you up to? Don't worry, Molly. You can rock with me. why? I didn't see anything wrong with him. Of course, you're just another talkative American. Like all foreigners, he just wants to make a good impression. impression? It caused damage. Be careful here. why? Something tells me he can become a perfect enemy. Look at him there. How far is it from Oxford? 16 quil�metros. 16 quil�metros? Is there nothing closer? Here we are. You can go down. Cardinal stands there. So that's it, huh? Pretty, isn't it? I hope you like the new colleagues. Although I don't understand your language, thanks for the ride. Oops, the reception committee. No, this is the Salvation Army! I'm Lee Sheridan. I'd like to go to my room before they know I'm here. Head to the archway on the left. Cross the courtyard. See the name on the door. You can leave your suitcase. Thanks. Excuse me, is this the Sheridan of America? Yes. I'm Masterson, chairman of the reception committee. You managed to catch me, huh? Certainly. Follow me, please. Mr. Sheridan. Welcome on behalf of Cardinal College. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. Rah-rah-rah. Sheridan. Rah-rah-rah. Sheridan, Sheridan. Sheridan. Hi guys. Sorry, Sheridan, I couldn't stop them. We could not disappoint them. That's fine with me, as long as the other faculties don't mind. You tried to avoid it, that solved the problem. Alright then, let's go. Nice to see you, Sheridan. We were all waiting for you. I think my father did it, the news really got around. Didn't I tell you? Don't be modest. Order please. the dean. � Wavertree. He and Beaumont met him on the train. Is he part of it too? Sure. And after being introduced you will have to give a speech. mind? Of course not. How cool, huh? Mr. Dean, let me introduce Lee Sheridan from America. Welcome, Mr. Sheridan. Thank you sir. Please drive Mr. Sheridan is chair of honor. Yes sir. This way. (in Latin) Mr. Sheridan, I'll give you the floor. Gentlemen... For the first time I understand what it means... old English hospitality. I was sure you would get to know the true sense of camaraderie and fairplay here. I met Mr. Paul Beaumont. Your friend, Mr. Wavertree. We Americans also have an old tradition. frankly. And it will be with the frankness of this foot of mine that I will give the change. This foot is capable of kicking an arach dean into space. Do you mind uploading here? Wait for it, Sheridan. no? Then I will come down to you. I hope you don't hold any resentment. Where are my eyeglasses? Take that boy. Who is responsible for this atrocity? I didn't see your face, sir. For you will be disconnected from this faculty. How absurd! There! Can you tell me your name, sir? N�o, n�o... Mr. Wavertree, may I know the reason for this free attack? I don't know what got into me, sir. Perhaps a sudden act of rebellion against authority. I saw you from the back and... Yes, go ahead, go ahead. Well, sir, it was an impulse. A brutal, primal impulse. Brutal and pri ... Ent�o? I was called to tell you about the kick in the ass. Shoot not... What rivalry is this for the honor of being kicked? I think there was some mistake. A serious mistake, for sure. And who are you, may I know? Sou Lee Sheridan, da Am�rica. Do you confess that it was you and not Wavertree who committed this insane act? Yes sir. It is, huh? Sr. Wavertree. I don't pretend to understand what drives a shy, harmless boy like you. to assume every act of indiscipline in this faculty. Look, sir... I don't see anything. As soon as you receive your apology letter I will decide whether your state of mind warrants a medical board opinion. Can go. Thank you sir. Come in, come in. How is it justified? It's that all butts look the same in these clothes I thought yours was someone else's. Other... May I know who was to be honored? What buttocks are so similar to mine? I prefer not to name names, but let him not mess with me. One more burst and it will be off. That means expelled, doesn't it? Yes. Sent out immediately. Go to your room and write a letter of apology. If possible, in English. Yes sir. Oh, perd�o. Sr. Sheridan. I think in theology it is what is called the bringer of evil. A provocative person who induces others to temptation. Summing up. Quietly, I must confess that I don't like you. Good day sir. Good Morning. Ol�, Sheridan. What were you doing there? Was he trying to clean up his act by taking my blame? No, actually it was out of pure selfishness. I have an uncle who was disconnected from here in '98. What about? I am your only living relative. And he wants you to follow his example. Pride issue, huh? Leaving here in an inglorious way, he will die happy. And you get into the money. � that a�. Why don't you slap him at once? This would guarantee your expulsion. Wouldn't it be a little forced? Besides, I don't think I would have the guts to do that. For that, I count on the support of more creative spirits. You can count on my creative spirit, That is if I decide to stay in this joint. Hello. Are you the Sheridan of America and Didcot? If you must know, I thought Didcot was a very bad joke. Well, I found it very funny. We had fun all the way to Oxford. What did the dean do to you? I wasn't in the mood for jokes either. He is known for his bad temper. He is kicked with the best of intentions and is annoyed. Miracle not have turned off. I wouldn't have called. Too bad you didn't. Just imagine the national repercussion it would have. Arrives at 3:00 pm, entertain college until 3:30 pm kicks the dean at 3:35 pm and is expelled back to America at 3:40 pm. All in less than an hour. You just gave me an idea. Why don't you try? If you run within time. Are you trying to get rid of me? On the contrary. It would be fun you-lo here waving. I tried to teach that word to my teacher but she has locked herself in her room with a Chinese dictionary, if she doesn't open the door any further. When I met you, I even thought you were cool. I almost grabbed him by his coat so he wouldn't jump on Didcot. What stopped you? Paul would have been furious. Poor Paul, isn't it? It's true. Well, I don't want to arrest you. It's better to run to break another record. Listen here, my precious, save your English, I'll run out of here. Of course, running with your tail between your legs. no. I'm walking. And if it doesn't come again, as I hope, take this to remember me. MS. Beaumont, this is no place for that. It will be held for a week. If you were more observant, Ms. Pinsent, you would see that I didn't kiss, I was kissed by force. Among. Good afternoon sir. Yea? How can I serve him? What is this, another joke? How, sir? Who is looking for, some indigenous? No sir, this year there are none at Cardinal. Let it go. What can I do for you? Nothing, sir, I have to do it for you. You've done a lot for me, Mr. Scattergood. You can call me Scatters, like everyone else. What do you intend to take with you? Everything. Hmm. Very well, sir. Your sock is punctured. I'll find a way. It will be like new when you return. No need to bother. It's no hassle. You must know little about Oxford. I've seen everything I wanted. Well, that wouldn't be possible. One day it doesn't. It would take years, in fact. And there's always something new. Something you didn't notice before. It's something that gets involved. Because it will need to involve a lot in my case. That's not how it works. Oxford is too old to do things in a hurry. The Cathedral, for example. Some parts were built a thousand years ago. That's a long time. is that over there? Not that one is the Magdelon Tower. Linda tamb�m, n�o? Until it is. You know, it's one of my favorite spots. I always stop by when passing by at night. It's like visiting an old friend. I will also meet many friends soon. Well I'm in need of some. Are you hearing those bells? Most are centuries old. With the same sound as when they were forged. You know, sometimes I seem to see Sir Walter Raleigh. and many other gentlemen of the time here in this room, leaning out of that window and listening to those bells. Exactly like us. It's the feeling you really have. Some students when they come back say that the sound accompanies them all their lives. I bet the same will happen to you wherever you are. What makes you think so? I have served many lords in my life. I can usually tell which ones like Oxford. When that happens, Oxford reciprocates in kind. I'm sorry I talked so much that I neglected your suitcase. Wait, Scatters. Can stop. This is... I get it, I get it, sir. You may come in. Looks like you'll be my tutor, sir. Just a moment. I have to mark where I left off. Otherwise, I never find it again. Well then. They sent me to speak with you to find out about my tasks. Ah, yes... sit down, sir... Jenkins. N�o, Sheridan, Lee Sheridan. It can't be. Jenkins is on the agenda. Sorry, but I'm still Sheridan. Very well, I will not insist. Well, Mr. Jenkins, what are you reading? Reading? Yes. I'm still halfway through "Gone with the Wind." No, no, I'm talking about studies. What is your area of ​​interest? Apparently I'll have to specialize in boxing. great. Very good. I would advise rowing too. I root for Blue. I remember when I competed against Cambridge... But as for your studies, Mr. Jenkins... Where to start? I would like to major in journalism. My father has a newspaper. Now, my dear, Oxford does not regard journalism as a serious study. I intend to major in American History My goodness, we have little to offer in this area to occupy it for 3 years. How about American and English History? I think it's a great suggestion. It is an unfortunate choice. In my opinion, since the fall of the Roman Empire nothing important has happened in the world. You're right. What is your honest opinion of Cle�patra? Cle�patra? That was a great woman, young man. Perhaps he lacked political vision, but he had his reasons... We will discuss this on another occasion. Come back in a couple of days and I'll give you a list of books. See you soon, Mr. Jenkins. Sheridan, sir. Yes, of course, I will take note. Let's see... oh yes, Mr. Jenkins. Sheridan, one moment. Why, the wandering boys. So you remember us, huh? Elephant memory. It's just that I'm not afraid of mice. I remember I said I ran. Tell me where and when I will demonstrate. Great, there will be a race for new students in half an hour. I'll enter you in the 400m if you're interested. Very kind of you. Kindness of you to accept. The track is 2 kms from here. You will need your bicycle. Make a mistake. The others are what you need. Well, we'll be looking forward to seeing you. Nice. You were extremely kind and I am extremely happy. The Yankees are coming, the Yankees are coming... Hey! Look where you're going! Ei! This is contradictory! Go to the other side. What are you doing here? Look where you're going! Voc�? Again? Sorry sir. This crass individualism of yours has got to stop, Mr. Sheridan. It should be obvious, even to you, that our hand is on the left. Do you mean that here the wrong side is the right one? And you're on the wrong side, Mr. Sheridan. I ask that from now on you make a superhuman effort to avoid me. Yes sir, I will try. Do it. Do it! Are you okay, sir? Yes I'm fine. Where can I fix this. Right there, sir. I would stay away from him if you are the lord. Before you were me. Good day sir. Yes. Something wrong with the bike, sir? No, I had them do it like that so it would keep going around. How, sir? Never mind, can you fix it? Of course, leave it to me. How long will it take? I'll have to do with my colleague. I hope it's quick. Say I'm in a hurry. H�? Ei, Jim. As a licensee. Hm? Hello. Are you the new store owner? If you become a regular, who knows? The idea is tempting. Do you understand flat tires? With the experience of these last few days, I should. This one is good. Finally, someone who understands English. I bet you know what it means to shake. Well I... I think I know. I love you Americans. Well then, in their honor, let's look at this tire. I would be very grateful. I don't think you told me your name. That's because I didn't say. Lee Sheridan. Mine is Elsa Craddock. Mrs. Craddock. Gosh, are you married? Astonished? A lot of people stay. My husband and I have a bookstore. She doesn't look like a bookstore owner. I sometimes give a little smack. And my husband is much older than me. That is, I am much younger than he is. I bet you don't understand. That I would not say. You just forget that I'm young and I need to have fun. You should meet my dean. God, he's even older than my husband My husband doesn't understand why I'm so solicitous. You see, I love helping college students. Especially the newcomers. By maternal instinct, no doubt. Why, you're making fun of me. I'm holding back as much as possible. Naughty. Where I was? That he was too young. Oh yes, but don't get me wrong. Claudius, my husband, is a sweetheart. And it's so smart. Sometimes read all night. If you must know, I think the guy is crazy. Good morning, Ms. Craddock. We can fix your bike, sir. Be quick, please. It won't take long. Ready in 15 days. Fifteen days? great. I'm only two weeks and ten minutes late for playoffs. My God, please use my bike. No thanks, I'll rent one from here. I would love for you to use mine. I'll need to return it, right? You're right. All right, see you soon. Craddock Bookstore. Any student will tell you where it is. Certainly. All right, everyone in your positions. R�pido. Hi guys. I'm sorry for being late. I'm even surprised you came. Kindness of you to wait. If you intend to participate in the race, you have to get ready soon. Mess up? Why, I'm always ready, Mr. Beaumont. What's up, guys? Are you feeling funny? Sorry if we didn't laugh. We English have little sense of humor. Don't worry, you run and I laugh. Don't be silly, Sheridan. You can't run like that. How? Ah, I must have forgotten. What nonsense. Can you hold it for me? It can stunt my growth. This clown has to stop. Don't worry. It's all to disguise that he doesn't know how to run. In their positions. Get ready. You are playing a ridiculous role. You don't understand anything about racing. Ser�? Gosh, the man is a freak! I still can't believe it. I don't see the grace. Sorry, friend. It's the first race I enjoyed watching. This climate of yours is tough. Next time I'll wear my overcoat. Cheerio. Thank you Wavertree. Keep the cigar as a souvenir. We have to admit, he knows how to run. It's as good as they say. The last time I tried to cheer him up a little, all that was left was to advertise in the newspaper. You are being unfair. I just wanted to enjoy the glory of her affection. None of that. Everyone knows you want to be expelled. But I don't claim to be responsible for your divorce from Oxford. What an idea. I never thought about it. Listen here, Elsa... If you can't today, how about tomorrow? no. But ask my husband... and see what you think of the idea. Want something? Oh no... I... I'll leave it for another time. Excuse me. Ol�. Oh dear. Where you've been, you bastard, I missed you. Same? How about we go to London on Thursday? Fifth? I would love. But I can't go. Can't think of an excuse? No... Good afternoon. Good afternoon Mr. Beaumont. Mr. Craddock, Thursday there will be an auction at Sotheby's. There are two books I would like to buy. Could you bid for me? Mr. Beaumont, why do you always insist that I come to London? You know I can't leave the store. I can go for you, Claudius, dear. Last time you didn't have much success, honey. Didn't buy anything. But it wasn't my fault. Anyone gets lost in the fog. That's why I missed the train back. At this time of year there is no fog. Well then my wife will, Mr. Beaumont. Thanks. Your kindness, Ms. Craddock. It will be a pleasure, Mr. Beaumont. I'll take the 10:00 train, honey. Hi, Molly. For those who can barely read, you've been buying a lot of books lately. Look who's Talking. Kissing your American friend in public. At least he's not married. Paul, aren't you getting into trouble? Don't worry about it. I know how to take care of my life. Excuse me. Good afternoon, Miss. Beaumont. I haven't seen her lately. Surely my brother makes up for my absence. He really is very nice, isn't he? Sometimes I think he's a fool. Can you get me Plato's Republic? If you look on the last shelf, you might find it. It's very helpful, isn't it? I try to be. Here's your bike, ma'am. Thanks. I thought you said that... Yes, thank you. No need... Oh, Claudius... I don't think you know my husband. How are you? I thought I had rented the bike to a woman who needed to go to the hospital. That's right, it was his sister. It wasn't my sister... But you said it. No, it was my aunt. Of course, your aunt. Aunt Abby, no relation to Westminster Abbey, of course. Do you happen to have "Burton's Fifteenth Century"? Yes, which edition? The finest with large letters. Fine with... Very well. You were smart. I admire smart men so much. Always at your service for any tightening. It feels like we've known each other our whole lives. Sometimes I am attracted to strangers. It seems like it was born to help lost tourists. Here it is, sir. Better get on with your business, the bookworm is on its way. Hello. Are you surprised? I would say indifferent. When did you decide not to come home? After you kissed me everything changed. After I kissed him? Of course, you'll say you forgot. How could I, because of that incident I will be grounded for a week. Because of that kiss that you... that I... that we gave? Precisely. But it was worth it, right? no. How vulgar exhibitionism was. And particularly it was amateur. How so, amateur? I just felt teeth and mouth. Everything is fine. You won in that preliminary. But wait are the main attraction. Thanks, but that's enough for me. Why don't you practice with Ms. Craddock? I'm sure she will cooperate. I wouldn't stay with her even if I won the lottery. These live ones are as safe as dynamite. We finally agreed. There was no time. Now that we're practically soulmates, how about we have dinner? Can not wait. Alone. Well, wait a minute. It's bad to eat alone, worse than drinking. My aunt Abby had this habit. One night she... I feel guilty for having so much fun. If I get kicked out... Then I buy college. I still don't know why I'm here. You English have always been in the hands of the Sheridans. During the war my great-great-grandfather captured so many red uniforms that we still use them as underwear. Ready, sir. We will? I think so. Don't tell me no � skating championship. I don't know, I never tried. I will like to see. Come on. How about, huh? Very well, not even I could do better. I'll give you two more chances. Nice partner I went to get. Hold my arm. I'd rather break my head than let a woman help me. Better stay seated, huh? OXFORD X CAMBRIDGE RELAY RACE There they come. Sheridan ahead. What a fantastic race. Isn't Lee Sheridan a glory? Awesome, I would say. How are you? I'm your uncle, Captain Wavertree. Do you join? I would love to, but I can't. But it was kind of you. See you soon. It's the spitting face of a girl who got me kicked out in '98. Who is she? Elsa Craddock. Lady. Now, here's your chance, boy. I was waiting for the occasion. Don't worry, I'll be expelled soon. I've been with her a lot lately. So it must have inherited something from me. I hope so. How beautiful. For an owl, you ran wonderfully. The team is very good. Not feeling well? I'm great, why? So modest all of a sudden. I thought I'd say I'd beat them with my legs behind my back. And even it could. That's how I like it. For a moment I thought I was hesitating. Am I to blame if I'm so good? There you go again. I was already starting to like you. And I thought it was already melting. So as not to waste time, it was agreed to anticipate the next event. Who changed that? All competitors report to the track. But you didn't even rest. It's just not taking those blue eyes off me. Both? I wanted to reserve one for the others. Leave them alone. I'll take this glove for luck and win. Where can I meet you later? Right here. Will you remember me? Sure. You are the girl with a glove. Beaumont. I'll have to run to Sheridan's place. But he's faster than me. I will not risk. You are rested. Talk to him. Very well, but he won't like it. Sheridan, I'm sorry, but you're not going to run. What story is this? You heard, they anticipated the race to save time. What does this have to do with me? You just ran and they don't want to risk it with you. I can beat anyone and you know it. Don't talk to me like that, I have nothing to do with it. Will you run in my place? In fact, I will. I understand. With the victory of the American boy Oxford and Cambridge draw 3x3. The 2 km relay should be decisive. And it will be tough. You are already in position. In position. Get ready. Ladies and gentlemen, Beaumont has replaced Sheridan in the Oxford duo. Oxford in front with the other just behind. Oxford does not seem to be in danger. Go Oxford! Give it! That's it, run! That's it! Run! Go. Pass the baton and run! Oxford gaining on, Cambridge close behind. Go steady! This! This long-legged boy from Cambridge looks dangerous. Come on, why are you falling behind? Come on, what's up, come on! Run! Damn, there goes our chance. Come on, Beaumont, get ready. Oxford is giving it its all. It makes its last lap very fast. Come on, stick to him. Go. This is impressive. The crowd is silent. Paul, are you okay? I am well. Sheridan is printing astonishing speed coming on the heels of Cambridge. Run even faster. You are catching up with your opponent. Yea? Sorry to say, but Ms. Beaumont refuses to answer the phone. Ah. Ent�o � un�nime, n�o? 100%. What is it? It looks like a funeral procession. Funny way to celebrate the victory over Cambridge. They did not consider it a victory. How? No, sir. It's going up to c. Please stay calm when they arrive. What do you want? We want to thank you for the brilliant display this afternoon. I won, didn't I? It's that there are different ways to win. His manner did not please us. Did you bring your pack to tell me that? You know how to take care of yourself, eh, Beaumont? This is no longer a feud between the two of you. Now we've all been involved. I'll smash the face of anyone who wants to face me. Oh, a prank. Splendid. We must not interrupt. Naturally. It must be with Sheridan... I hope. Sheridan? Which you insist on calling Jenkins. Ah, yes, Jenkins, last boy. On this I disagree. Take, sir, another pair. Anything else sir? You bet. For some of these guys, the day is just getting started. Don't take it seriously. It was a simple prank. I remember a Prime Minister who went through the same thing. And he wasn't even wearing underwear. You can do that with a Prime Minister, but you can't get away with an American. Good evening, are you a member of this university? Yes. Do you know that students are not allowed to go to bars? Yes sir. Your name and college? Morgan. Cardinal. Another one, Gladys. I want to awaken the beast in me. Take care, Mr. Wavertree. You know the lookouts are watching. You will be welcomed with open arms. I already told you about my uncle, didn't I? You and your uncle. Where is Beaumont? Hi, Sheridan. How about a drink? You must be needing it. Have you seen Paul Beaumont around here, doll? I believe he's in the private bar. And look at what he calls me. I shouldn't have told you, Gladys. Oh, then she's in trouble. How modest. Let's go outside, Beaumont. What if I prefer to stay here? Of course, without your pack. Evidently our Yankee wants one more lesson. Excuse me, dear. We will. Paul, please no. Don't worry. Coming or not? I prefer to settle here. I don't want to be seen in public with you. OK. Your brute. Revive, Paul. Come on, Paul, finish him off. The lookouts. The lookouts. Come on, get out of here. See you later, Beaumont. Paul, come on, get out of here. Paul. Suma. Paul, Paul ... I'm a university student and I'm getting drunk. Sheridan! Go. Paul! Get me out of here. Are you ok? Are you a member of this university? what? I don't understand, Mr. Beaumont. He insists that he didn't attack Simmons. Yes sir. And don't say who was it? Sorry sir. Are you sure it was Mr. Beaumont who attacked him? Thank you, everything. I'm very worried, Mr. Beaumont. Attacking a guard is serious enough, but denying is unforgivable. I assure you it wasn't me. The facts indicate that it was. Unfortunately some things have also reached my ears. Concerning a certain lady. I heard you were with her last night. His family is distinguished, his background excellent. We all thought he would make a brilliant career as a diplomat. If I get you out of college, I'll kill your career. You will be fined 20 pounds. One more violation from you and you will be disconnected immediately, understand? Yes sir. Good morning Mr. Beaumont. Paul hid behind the door and as soon as the guard appeared he attacked him. It was... Come in. Hello. Hi Molly, what an unexpected pleasure. Where is Paul, still with the dean? The defendant is still trembling before the jaws of justice. What really happened? You were there, weren't you? Where there's confusion, there's a Wavertree whenever possible. So tell me what Paul did. Simply knocked out a guard. no! I don't know why I didn't think of it before. And what are people talking about Elsa Craddock? It had almost nothing to do with it. So she was there. Well... Paul and Sheridan were fighting when the watchman came in... Hi, Paul. At last. Are you ok? Splendid. 20 pounds fine and threat of termination on next infraction. Just a little bit for assaulting a watchman. It wasn't me, it was Sheridan. Paul! what? I thought you said you saw him... Well, I... What gave you that idea? Looks like I was wrong. I... I think I'll study a little. But... I also need to study. I hope everything works out. I need to speak to Snodgrass. So it's like that. I'm going too. Paul, it doesn't even look like you. So do you believe them? Why are you defending Craddock? Everyone knows he was with her. She has nothing to do with it. I repeat, your friend Sheridan assaulted the watchman. You always hated Lee. But that's too much. Too much indeed. My own sister taking me for a liar. But, Paul, you've been seen. I understand that Lee was mean to you in the race, but he's already been punished. You badly eat like that. And if I had any sense, I would stop dating him. The other day he said he knew how to take care of his own life. I know too. Very good. Lower yourself by going out with him. I can't stop it. You can't. I cut it yesterday because of you, now I regret it. I think I'll call you for tea. great. So things become clear. Do you remember me? Listen, Sheridan, are you going to take this further? And why not? I knew you were cocky, now I see you're a coward and a liar too. Coming from you is praise. I enjoyed hitting that guard... and who will take the blame. It's just too bad I won't kick you out. There's only one way with you. Take off your coat. We are starting to understand each other. I was waiting for this. What are you waiting for? After what happened, if I'm caught fighting with you, I'll be expelled. What about? You wouldn't understand, Sheridan. An Oxford degree is more important to me than spanking you. Skirt! I knew you'd use your English principles to get away. Skirt! Beautiful. The brave Englishman. Hi, Sheridan, here? Your place is upstairs. I just gave my condolences to Beaumont. Don't say. Very dignified of him. Certainly. Wait a... You start to think we took the wrong person's pants off. Shut up, Wavertree, Paul is just annoyed. It passes. He's nice people. My room is right there. Come in for a drink. At� logo, Lee. At� a pr�xima. It was nice of him. Even more so after what we did. After all, he's not such a bad guy. I just can't understand... Come on, cowboy, get down from there. I'm always carrying you, now it's your turn. Hey, wait a minute, guys. Come lend a hand here. Sheridan is asking for a bath. Fine by me. You who load the boat. (in Latin) Do you mind moving, Ramsey? no. But I'll have to fine you for breach of etiquette. why? For foisting your scolding on Sheridan during the meal. Scatters, bring the penalty to Mr. Beaumont. Very well, sir. I'll bring you a big one. I hate wasting food, even this one. More to table two athletes deserves to be attacked in front of your succulent repast. We all go together. I think it left Wavertree. Come on, boys. ready? Atirem. Age and position have their disadvantages. In my day, I would have been able to hit Mr. Jenkins. He must be talking about Sheridan, as usual. Yes, yes, of course. The penalty, Mr. Beaumont. Do you intend to drink it, sir? no. You can serve beer for everyone. Very well, sir. So I drink. The more they fight, the better it will be for all of us. The more blood, the more beer. Peter, how about a singles regatta tomorrow? why? To hear the Sunday choirs from the Magdelan Tower. Yes, of course, I will. And you, Ken? Waking up at four in the morning to hear a choir? Never. Are you coming, Lee? No thanks. I'll take my own boat. I bet you won't be alone. Who will it be with? Who is she? Don't say that, I don't care. I wasn't even going. No need, we all know. She is very beautiful. And, if I'm not mistaken, a student at this university. There was no need to exaggerate either. Leave Beaumont alone! All right, Lee. What is it, do you want to fight your own battles? Watch out. Good Morning. Nice to have you on board. Good Morning. The pleasure is mine. Listening. Isn't it beautiful? Do you know how beautiful it is? I still look sleepy. If that's sleep, don't rub your face. It's a beautiful sleep, the most beautiful I've ever seen. It's very silly, I hope it never changes. Oh... better sit down before it's too late. Better get rid of this trap if I don't want to fall. Did I say that? I'm getting more British every day. If my father heard that, he would see stars. He must be wonderful. Even being an American. �, yes. He also thinks you're cool. To me? He doesn't even know me. Yes you know. The postman passes you under the door twice a week. Then my father cuts you open it. Then you must know me very well. I would like you to know my city. Would you like? I would love. Well, pretend we're in Lakedale. This is McKinley Street. Up ahead is the Yankee Clipper. Hello Dad how are you? Did you like it? It's a beautiful little town. They must be finding me very strange. Don't take your eyes off me. That nothing. They are the nicest people in the world. Do you remember the story of the young man who arrived in a town and, out of shyness, asked an old man what kind of people lived there? N�o, n�o conhe�o. The old man then asked; "What kind of people were there in your land?" The young man replied, "The best people in the world... the bravest and kindest." And the old man replies: "Well, come in, that's the kind of people you'll find here." Wasn't that city Oxford? Or Lakedale, perhaps. The moral of this story was for me, wasn't it? For you and Paul. I wish they were friends. It's easy to talk. Paul behaved very badly that night at the Queen's Head. No, Molly... Paul is not like that... Talk to him and settle everything. I can't. Why not? Well... Molly, I think I need to tell you something I should have told you a long time ago. You don't know what really happened that night. Look! We have to run, I'm just in my pajamas under my coat. The biggest risk is taking her back. I can't be caught. It's Paul and he knows who's with him. Don't worry. But he'll be turned off if he's caught with... her. It's not so much for him, but he could at least think about his family. Take me Home. I don't want to stay here anymore. Can I finish talking? Forget it, Lee. I don't think Paul deserves it. We will. But it's about Paul. So I don't want to know. Take me Home. Please Molly. If you don't want to, I will. I was chosen to participate in the Bump race by Cardinal and I think we have a great chance of winning this year. Lembran�as, Lee. What is a Bump Race? The first rule of a bump race is this: Let's say this is the River Thames. But Lee says they'll row a river called Isis. In Oxford they call him Isis. Why don't you make up your mind at once? Here are the boats of all the faculties. They are all lined up one behind the other. Why not side by side? What a silly question. I don't know either. why? The river is very narrow. The objective is for each boat to touch the one in front. That's why they call it Bump. That I already suspected. Let's say this one is Lee, on a Cardinal's boat, and the one in front is from... It doesn't matter, it won't stay long. Let's say you're from New College. If Lee pulls over, his will move one position forward. I need the sheet about the governor... Easy, take it when we finish the race. Then you will have to pull over to that boat. Do you mean that to win the race, you just touch the boats? That's the idea. This boat has to pull over to this one and this one without letting the one from behind touch it. If he manages to touch the one in front, the next day... The next day? What is it? Six-day bike race? No, a six-day bump race. How do you know who won? If Lee touches every boat in front of him... There, the Cardinal College faces the river. On the other hand, if the boat behind you manages to catch up with Lee's and get closer... Run, Lee, go! Cardinal, go! Show them! For�a, Jenkins! It will pull over. It will pull over. Reme, Lee, reme, reme! Two more leanings and he will pass ahead in the river. Two more days of this barbarity and I don't know. Ol�, Molly. Ol�. This time, leaning in, Cardinal passes ahead. I didn't sleep a wink yesterday, and you? I slept like an angel, flying to first place. Listen, same tactic as yesterday. Short strokes, even shorter. Let's go to 40. Yes? Why not 42? Everything is fine. They're almost catching up. Come on, you can do it! Fight, Cardinals, fight! Just a little more, Mr. Jenkins. Paul! Paul! Pa...Cardinals! Fora, all of you. Let's go to 42. That, Lee, glorious. It was glorious! Gentlemen. To the King. To the King. Gentlemen... On an occasion like this... nothing more appropriate than to call the one who first took Cardinal to the front of the river our friend and speaker, Mr. Snodgrass. Gentlemen. Let's toast together. As the oldest rower of the Blues present here... It is a privilege to address you. Today, when I remember, I see that the greatest pride of my life that's when Cardinal's boat, which I had the honor of being rower, passed in front of the river. And the saddest moment was when I saw the stern of the Cambridge boat pass my oar. But this time I believe it will be Oxford that will show Cambridge its stern. And if this is the case, it will be because of two of our athletes who will certainly be elected to compose the university's boat. I wish they would speak. First I want to call our magnificent rower my young friend, Mr. Jenkins. Sim, Sr. Sheridan. I hope you'll forgive my shyness in speaking. With only fifteen minutes from Oxford, I gave my first and, if you don't mind, last speech. Thanks. I now call the captain, Mr. Paul Beaumont. Thanks. I hope our coach will be proud if we win. Now I think we should celebrate, as Cardinal tradition calls for, setting fire to the boat. To have the honor of lighting the fire... I nominate the man to whom we undoubtedly owe our victory. Sr. Sheridan. Let's go to Bump's bonfire then. Please, Mr Wavertree, please. It was really cool what you said. I felt a little embarrassed. I hope we can be friends. I'm sorry, but I choose my friends very carefully. But I will leave on Thursday together with the team for the final decision. We'll stay there until race time. But it will come back later. I know, but it had to end someday. It better be now. Don't be silly, let's smile. I'm trying, but it's not easy to know that a glorious day like this will never be repeated. Try to be sensible, Elsa. You have to think about your career. But I have nothing, nothing. I've never loved anyone other than you. And I will love no one else. Don't say that, Elsa. But it's true, Paul. I will always be faithful to the memory of our love, always. Paul we're almost at the store, stop. Driver, stop here. Please don't go out. Goodbye. No, you don't need to. Excuse me... Looking for something in particular? No, but I seem to have found it. I shouldn't talk like that, I meant books. Don't say. I'm Elsa Craddock, Ms. Craddock. Mrs? You're surprised she's married. It's always like that. In fact, my husband is much older. That is, I am much younger. Elsa. Sure. We can bid on any auction. I will personally look for what you want in London next Thursday. Thanks. Goodnight darling. She was waiting. Will you tell me where you've been all day? Well, Claudius... Or should I say? Good night Sir. Craddock. Where is Mr. Beaumont? On the first floor, sir. Number 10, on the right. Paul. Paul. Paul. Mr. Beaumont. Let me in. Open this door or I break in. What does it means? My wife is in this room. Impossible at this hour. Open this door. Open it or put it down. Please Mr. Craddock. Mr. Craddock, why are you trying to break into Mr. Beaumont? To get my wife. How? Open this door! Wait. Let me take care of that. Mr. Beaumont, please open the door. This is terrible. Get me out of here. Where's Paul? I don't know. It's not here. Waiting. Everything is fine. We can go out on the Wavertree porch. I don't have the courage. It will come even if it is loaded. It's not time to ask. Now break down that door. You won't let me down, will you? I would push you for putting Paul in this trouble. Obviously there's no one. I know it has and I insist on going in. I know you're wrong, but I can enter Mr Wavertree's bedroom balcony. Well, do that to undo Mr. Craddock. What do we do now? Hang on. What happened to Paul? You are not. Vim prevent him. De qu�? My husband got suspicious and said he would talk to him tomorrow morning. I wanted to let you know to arrange what we would go.... I apologize, sir. So it's the American, huh? I just came here to... What's the problem? Mrs. Craddock just came to deliver some books as usual Do you expect me to believe this story? This is absurd. I don't want to hear another word. Well, you'll hear a lot when we get home. And who will speak is me. I would appreciate it if you could explain this unpleasant incident. There's nothing more to say, sir. Too bad your Oxford career should end like this. So will I be turned off? I don't see an alternative. I'm sorry, Sheridan. I'm sorry too, sir. So try to take the necessary precautions. Remember when I first heard those bells, Scatters? I do remember, sir. Said he would listen to them for the rest of his life. They say they have a special sound on the day of departure. I wanted my father to hear them. And why not? The regulation allows you to stay another 3 days. I already sent a telegram to the ship at Southampton. I'm meeting him in London today. But he couldn't... No, Scatters. I can't let him come now. It is easier to explain the situation elsewhere. But won't you be in London for the race? No be. That's what he came for, but... expected to see me inside the boat. Please call Mr. Beaumont for me. Very well, sir. Tell him I'm going to London and I want to see him before I leave. Yes sir. Oh, Sr. Beaumont... I'm sorry, Sheridan, I just heard about last night. Yea? How about telling me what really happened. There's nothing more to tell. It was just like that. I find it hard to believe that Elsa has come to meet you. I understand, but it's too late to talk about it. no. There's something behind this and I want to know the truth. All right, if you want to know. It's been months since Elsa and I have seen each other behind your back. He canceled several meetings with you saying he had to stay with Claudius, didn't he? All these times she was with me. We had a good laugh. I imagine it's at Molly's expense too. Don't get her into it. Too late. I once told her that you were an outsider. But unfortunately she believed in you. Good thing we unmasked him in time. I'm sorry, Miss. Beaumont does not wish to see Mr. Sheridan. I'm sorry, but Ms. Beaumont doesn't want to see you. Spoke to her? No, she didn't want to answer. What is it? What's that, another prank. No, this time it's your friends, sir. I knew you were coming to see him. I've been here for almost 50 years I only remember celebrating expulsions just once before this one. The first student ended up becoming governor. Ol�, Lee. On your arrival you were poorly received but now everyone is gathered at the main gate for a true farewell. And also to clearly express our repudiation of his expulsion. Thank you, but I'm taking the eleven o'clock train to London. Ent�o we will go together tied to this. Go. Wait, wait. Scatters, goodbye. Goodbye. Get your bags. Yes, this time the bags, not the pants. What's happening? Looks like a stop, sir. I was always stopped. Take this inside, please. I'll take a peek. Hey Lee! Son! Lee! Hey, Lee! Get out of the way, that's my son. Lee! My uncle would certainly like you. And this farewell too. Want to switch places? Well I would. Look. That's it, Lee. Excuse me, are you part of the University? No, sir. My college is Lakedale. Lakedale? Yes, in America. Wants to know? That one is my son. I'm sorry sir. Feel sorry for what? Let me help you, sir. Hey, Lee! Lee! Lee, look at your father here! Here Lee! Oi, Lee. Dad. Dad. It's just that I wanted to see him. On top of the world. Wait, I have to go down. What is it, are you getting sick? You don't have to go down, I don't want to get in the way. I told them to stop! Now now. Ol�, pai, how are you going? Did you not receive my telegram? no. I've never seen you so well. Oxford definitely did you good. Wait, dad... Go back there. I hope. No, wait a minute. Listen, boys. This is my father. Hi guys. He came from America to see me row against Cambridge. And it's better to win. I traveled 8000 kms just to see. I even have the headlines prepared. "Lee Sheridan rows..." Just listen, would you mind if we interrupted this parade? I would like to be with my father for a while. No, I don't want to interrupt the party. I want to talk to you, far away from here. What's the rush, Lee? Okay, if you insist. I'm here at the hotel... What's the rush, Lee? So that's it, huh? S. Well, it's not enough for me. It doesn't make sense. You mean to tell me that all this time you've been writing about Molly, you've been hanging around with this Craddock? Yes. I find it strange coming from you, Lee. What does Molly have to say about all this? I don't know, I called but she didn't want to talk. Who, hein? It also strikes me as strange of her. And �. I have to see her but I don't see how. Let me see... I have an idea. Write a letter saying you want to tell him something no one else knows. That is, before saying goodbye forever. Knowing women as I do, this will work. You wouldn't lose anything with that, right? Of course not. Come on, sit down and write the letter. Do you mind being alone? All right, dad. Doc Williams would never forgive me if I didn't visit his old college. Ent�o voc� � a Molly. And you are your father? I thought Lee was exaggerating, but I see she's prettier than I thought. Thank you... I'm so worried... Tell me... What do you think of this whole mess Lee got himself into? Lee didn't get into any trouble. Don't believe a single word. We Sheridans really know how to choose our women. Where is Lee? Not hotel. Said he called but didn't want to talk to him. I never got the message. I was waiting for you to give news. Lee is just as guilty as I am. He is protecting someone. I should have noticed. It's the first time he's lied to me. There must be something very serious behind this. H, yes. And I think I know what it's about. He knows? Can we sit down and talk? We have to think together. Excuse me. Good Morning. I look for a book, something light to read on the train. Follow me, please. Here is the fiction. Everything at a discount. Let's move and close the deal. Don't say. I bet the boys are going to miss a really pretty hand. You sir are very kind. It is the purest truth. Send it to Dan Sheridan at the Mider Hotel. Sheridan? Hm-hmm. My son studies here, Lee Sheridan, you know? Conhe�o, sim. Nice guy, no? Your son is a great man. Good to hear you say that. In fact, I should be mad at him. He's going to get kicked out of college because they caught him with a woman. Did he say who it was? I did, but I don't think I remember. Let me see... I'll get the change. So you know Lee, huh? Yes. How interesting. And you, what's your name? �... Sra. Craddock. Craddock... Crad.... That was the name! Voc� seria a Elsa Craddock? Yes I am. Well, who knew? Now I see that Lee wasn't to blame. I didn't know I chose so well. I assure you there was nothing wrong. Of course not. I'm glad Lee met a friendly attitude. Glad you understand. Of course I understand. But it's a shame he's expelled for having met the most beautiful girl in town. It's hard for me too. I've come a long way just to see you win the race. Of course, you must be feeling terrible. Yes, I am. I was counting on you to do well here. I wish I could do something. Me too. You know, I was just thinking... This girl is smart. If there was a way out, she would know. I thought a lot... Very kind of you. Very kind... You know, if we think together maybe we'll find a solution. There is a way... See? It worked. But no, I would be afraid. Fear? A girl with your strength? I wish I could help. And you will, with that big heart you have. N�o? I will try. Thanks. A thousand times thank you. You just made this old man very happy. It worked. The girl even has some value. Impossible. What value? It wouldn't surprise me if we found out you have a heart of gold. no! Tell me everything. I know I'm nervous, but it was an ordeal. Tell the truth? Yes. But you helped, it's been so wonderful. Well... You understand, sympathize. But it was very brave. I know what it must mean to you to come here... Thank you... Even so, I think it's all amazing. Please don't be annoyed with him. Not that. I don't understand why Sheridan took the blame. You know how men are, they never denounce themselves. I'm sure your friends never reported you. Thanks. But I never had to guard against such an accusation. You may come in. Did you call? Yes. How are you, Miss. Craddock. Como vai, Marmeduke? Mr. Wavertree, if you are to believe what I have heard, you are responsible for grave offence. In fact, several, sir. He had a woman in her room at night. Who? I? No, sir. This is something I've never done. It never occurred to me. Why, Marmeduke, how can you? It was silly of us, but it was nothing more than a flirtation. With all due respect, sir, but I don't understand. Don't lie, Mrs. Craddock confessed of his own free will. Everything? Everything. Everything. Confessed? Oh... what a relief. I don't need to lie anymore. So do you admit it? Yes sir. Everytime. I would have, but we Wavertrees always protect the women in question. He has a natural strength. Try to use it for good, Marmeduke. You're right. I won't take up your time anymore, Ms. Craddock. Thanks. Made me a man, after all. Mrs. Craddock, for her own good, I suggest she sever her ties with Oxford. We're leaving. Let's sell the bookstore and move to Aldershot. He thinks there's good demand there... and there's also the officers' club. Hmm...yes...I understand. Well, goodbye. Goodbye. So I figure Sheridan will be accepted back. Sure. And I turned off? Mrs. Craddock is a very attractive woman. Yes sir. Capable of disorienting anyone with more limited intellectual capacity... Yes. ...like you. Yes. Oh, but I assure you, sir... What? I'm taking into account your sobriety and effort history and the fact that it's almost forming. Do you think you should, sir? In these circumstances you will be detained for a week and fined £1. Can go. But sir. Spare me your thanks. Good Morning. But... I said good morning. Good day sir. Get up-it hurts! I've been thinking so I'm not going to let you get away with it so easily. Listen, Beaumont... So you don't want to fight, do you? I prefer not. I just want to ask you one thing. Can we make peace, Yankee? As well? I just saw Elsa. He spoke to the dean and confessed. Then you will be expelled. No, she said it was Wavertree. Wavertree? Have you thought about what we're going to do with Cambridge now? Row, you one-shot Yankee. Wait until you get out of here and you'll see. Put your distance, Jenkins! The name is Sheridan. Okay, okay, I'll take note. Come on, Jenkins... that's it, Sheridan! Come on, you soldiers, let's go to 44. T� certo, cowboy. Oh Lee, how wonderful, how wonderful. He did it all himself... Didn't I say? She was absolutely right. That's it! Can't take it, huh?
