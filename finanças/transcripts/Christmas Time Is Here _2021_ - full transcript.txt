[INSTRUMENTAL VERSION OF "WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS" PLAYING] [BONNIE] I hope there's some Santa scones left. One week till Christmas and then we have to wait another year. - Nia? - Huh? Are you even listening to me? Uh, yeah. Having no Santa scones will destroy all hopes of having a merry Christmas. Yes. Exactly. - Looks delicious. - Oh, trust me they are. - Thank you. - No problem. Hi. How are you? Oh, I've got something... [SIGHS] I'm sorry, Bonnie. It's just our new client, Julian Thompson... he is relentless. He has sent over 15 text messages just this morning alone. Listen to this, listen to this. "Optima Getaways is very picky about the kind of property we require for a 'niche resort.'" [LAUGHS] Or, or... "We want traditional yet cutting edge. "Inviting but exclusive. Charming, not obsequious." Someone likes their thesaurus. [LAUGHS] What's another word for difficult? I know. But you know what they say about big clients. [BOTH] Big commission. And we need that right now. [JULIAN ON PHONE] Hey, caught me just as I got the last Santa scone. You know what that means? Do you know what that means? It's going to be a good day. That's an interesting place to set the bar, Julian. But okay. Oh, come on. This town's great. It's like something out of a Christmas fable. How did you find this place? Spent a summer here with a buddy of mine from college. Sean... Robinson. [ROBYN] Oh, yes. That tech billionaire. Maybe we could get some cross promotion going on with one of his companies or all of them? He's not just a business prospect, Robyn. - He's my best friend. - [SIGHS] I'm staying with him and his wife while I'm here. I've already thought of 15 ways we could work together. Only 15? You're slipping, Thompson. I know I'm slipping, but trust me. You will not regret letting me run with this. Pine Valley Resort will be the greatest niche project Optima's ever done. Now, that's setting a high bar. I always do. [BONNIE AND NIA LAUGHING] - Those look good. - Oh, it's officially Christmas. You're wearing your mother's watch. Yeah. It was her favorite one. She loved this thing with all of her heart. I love how it's a tradition for you to wear her watch. Yeah, well, it's not very practical. It's broken. You tell the time on your phone anyway. Besides, Christmas is about the magical decorations. - Ahh. - The holiday spirit. Hmm, and this Christmas is about closing sales. - Okay. - [LAUGHS] We need to. What do you think Mr. Optima Getaway is going to think about his realtor wearing a broken watch? Maybe he'll think it's cute. And it's a good conversation starter. - Hi Malcolm. - Oh, my two favorite ladies. [BONNIE] Two large coffees, please. - [NOTIFICATION ALERT] - And do you want a Santa scone? You gotta be kidding me. [JULIAN] Okay. Just sent. Oh, okay. Two coffees. What's going on? It's my parents' inn. It's interesting but it seems kind of small for our purposes. We'll have to build up just about any property we find, but starting with an existing inn is beneficial in many ways. Is it for sale? Everything's for sale if you - write a big enough check. - Ah-ha. - Not too big, we have a budget. - And I'll stick to it. But this feels exactly like the kind of place we need. Can you imagine what it's like at Christmas? I don't want to imagine anything. I want you to get current photos and realtime data. - You got it, boss. - Happy hunting. [PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] And if you need extra blankets or anything just call down. - Hey Dad. - Oh hey there, Nia. - Brought you a coffee. - Oh, thank you. - Which one's mine? - That one's yours. Oh, I love watching how excited you still get after all these years running the inn. It's part of the job description. I love it. But don't worry, I love you more. Oh, I was worried about that. [BOTH LAUGH] [SIGHS HAPPILY] The place looks magical. Oh, it's the same every year. I know. Perfect. Almost, can you run by Tina's shop and get me some more Santa lights? - Ours are burnt out. - Sure. We need them for the outside for this year's festivities. Have you got your Christmas poem picked out? Nearly. I'm looking for something extra special in case... well, you know. Hey. Don't talk like that, Dad. I got this big client. We might not have to sell. Sorry, sorry. I'm just trying to be realistic. Your dad's got to retire someday. I know, but just a few more clients like this and I might be able to take over... soon. Hopefully. Somehow. I'll figure it out. I'm sure you will. - [NOTIFICATION ALERT] - Oh. [SIGHS] Something wrong? No, just this new client coming in from the city. It's this outfit called Optima Getaway. They're looking for a property in Pine Valley to turn into a resort. They actually asked if the inn was for sale. - Optima Getaways. - Mm-hmm. - Really? - Mm-hmm. You know the inn isn't all that profitable these days. It might be a good idea to... Hey. Don't worry Dad. We won't have to sell. [PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - Thompson! - Robinson! [LAUGHS] Yay, you still remember the handshake. How could I forget? Merry Christmas, man It's so good to see you. Come on, come inside. Hey Michelle. How you doing? Ah, much better now that you're here. I'm absolutely certain you're going to be on my side. Not a chance. This is my guy. - I've known him for longer. - That's irrelevant to whether or not he has good taste. Hmm, pardon me? What are we talking about? Lighting. I want to put up these simple yet tasteful Christmas lights. But Sean wants... Candy cane lights! Remember these, bud? No way! You still have these? Yeah. Every Christmas in college and every Christmas since, because it's tradition and they're fun. Unlike those which are, um, what's the technical term I'm looking for? Oh yeah. Boring. Yeah, I'm sure those were all the rage in your dorm room. Julian, help me out here. Okay maybe I should find a hotel. Not a chance, man. We're going to have a blast. Just like the last time you stayed here in the summer. Only uh, with snow. Hmm. Yeah. And instead of you running an ice cream stand you run a tech empire. [GROANS] "Empire," that just, it sounds so... Silicon Valley? Yes. And this is Pine Valley. The whole reason I brought the business out here was to avoid that type of thing. He's building a new campus next year. - You're expanding? - Yeah. Talking to a guy about some land just outside of town thinking offices, manufacturing... Maybe your clients might need a resort to stay while they're here. A hustler. I love it, I love it. [SIGHS] Man, I'm such an idiot! I forgot your housewarming gift. Oh pfft. You didn't have to. Sure I did. I guess now I have some shopping to do. We could always use some more Christmas lights. Whoa. [FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL JINGLES] [CHUCKLES] [NOTIFICATION ALERT] [DOORBELL JINGLES] Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I was just about to check out with those. - With these? - Mm-hmm. But um, well, did you put them back? No. Well, technically yes, but that's only because I was on my phone. Oh, well it looks like they're the last one. So, I'm sorry but I really need them. You need Santa Claus lights? Yeah. Well, don't you? Touch√©. How about this? How about we share them. I take them this Christmas, you take them next? - All right? Happy New Year. - I have a better idea. How about we split them? Right down the center. I'll go get the scissors. [LAUGHS] Okay, for real. Um, why don't we flip a coin? - Okay. Flip a coin? - Yeah. Heads or tails? Uh... Heads. No, no, no, no, no, tails, tails, tails. No, no, no, no, no, heads. Which one is it? Uh, tails. - [GROANS] - Woo! How about a bribe? [LAUGHS] You don't like to lose, do you? Listen, this is just a perfect gift for my friend, okay? I'll buy you whatever you want in the store. [SIGHS] Look, my dad asked me to come pick these up and this is a really important Christmas for him so. Maybe you and your friend can figure, I don't know, something, something else out? You know? - Mm-mm. Mm-mm. - No? Okay. How about cash? Oh wow, okay. There it is. Um, look... I don't know where you're from, but here in Pine Valley flashing money to get whatever you want just doesn't work around here. Okay? Sorry. Look, I have a very important meeting to get to, so... Merry Christmas, buddy. I really am sorry by the way. - Hi. - Hi, Merry Christmas. [EXHALES] [DOORBELL JINGLES] [DOOR CLOSES] [LAUGHS] Oh, come on. He was flirting with you. I mean, maybe it was charming at first. But then it got like super weird. Like, chill out about the lights. You know what I mean? Well? Was he cute? - [STAMMERS] - He was! - What does that even matter? - Nia! [BOTH] It matters. [BOTH LAUGH] What? My watch. - It's working. - When did that happen? I don't know. It's never worked. Not since before my dad gave it to me. - Never? - Never. It's a Christmas miracle. I don't know about all of that. It's a watch. I mean maybe, I bumped it and a gear got unlocked or something. - I don't know. - Mm-hmm. I don't know, uh, I gotta make some photocopies. Can you keep an eye out for corporate resort guy? - Uh-huh. Will do. - Thank you. Let me know if you get any other signs. [CHUCKLES] Oh. Hi. Welcome to Pine Valley Realty. You must be Mr. Thompson. Julian. Yes. Are you Nia? Oh no. I... I'm Bonnie. I'm her partner. She... she'll be out in a minute. Mm. Thank you. Very nice place you guys have here. Whoa! - It's you. - Nia? - Did you follow me here? - Nia. - For the lights? - Nia! Okay, listen buddy. Listen. I, I, I won the game fair and square. - Nia. - No. I need to say this, Bonnie. If you're here to apologize about the whole cash thing, listen, don't even worry about it. But I got a very important client coming, so I'm just... just gonna need you to... Stay! Because this is Julian Thompson from Optima Getaways. Very important client. So, um, I'm just parked right out front. After you. This is me right here. [NIA SIGHS] Okay. You know what? Let's not let this silly first impression get in the way of finding you a great property. You're right. Let's start over. - Truce? - Truce. That's a nice watch. Uh, thanks. It was my mom's. It's kind of a family heirloom. Hmm. Craftsmanship is amazing. So, uh, shall we head out? 'Cause um... I'm going to need my hand back... to drive. - Yeah. - Yeah. Certainly is quaint. It's one of Pine Valley's original buildings. Valentine's Day, Halloween, Christmas. It's' the sweet spot for sweets. So, if we took over... we'd be taking candy from the kids. Oh, I'm sure they could figure out somewhere else to get their tooth decay. [CHUCKLES] It's really nice, but it's not as cozy as I was hoping for. I kind of like that last place I sent you... Pine Valley Inn. Uh, I'm still waiting to hear back from the owners to see if they'd even consider selling but... [LAUGHS WEAKLY] We'd make a very generous offer. Noted. Um, I'll keep on trying. In the meantime, let me tell you how great this property is. So, it is zoned for commercial, industrial, and residential. Meaning you could put basically anything here. Eating facility, retail, spa, if that's your kind of thing. - [LAUGHS] - Mmm. This is delicious. - Want some? - No, thanks. Uh, and don't forget that it comes with quite the plot. Meaning there is tons of square footage to expand. Mm, yeah. Honestly I still think the other side of town is more suitable to our needs, kind of like by Grocery Point. Where the Pine Valley Inn is. Oh. You know where it is? - Wow, you sure do your research. - Yes. - I've also been here before. - Oh, yeah? Sean Robinson was a roommate of mine in college. Oh, so you know Sean. No way. Yeah, and I also spent a summer here with him and his folks. Oh, and I'm so glad you did, because, as you know, Pine Valley has a very healthy tourism industry, a strong workforce, and we're really close to the city. Yeah. It's got all that. But um... it's got a bit more. You know? Some of that small-town... magic. - Magic? - Yeah. [LAUGHS] Sorry, magic was just not a part of my pitch. [BOTH LAUGH] Maybe it should've been. - Seriously? - Yeah. I mean, I'm not you. But if I was... I would probably do things slightly differently, considering that I'm a big buyer and all. But I'm not you, so... What else would you like to pitch me on this place? [AWKWARD LAUGH] And then he proceeds to tell me, of course, how I can do my job better. He says to me that I could use more passion and Christmas spirit and more conceptual visual thinking and less demographics, building codes, and square footage talk. - He said that? - He said that. - Seriously? - Seriously. But in that passive-aggressive kind of charming way that I just can't stand. Yowza, and I thought I had a tough day. Can you take him from me, - please? - No. No. - Please, please, please... - No, no, no, no, no. I don't know if I can do another day of his hemming and hawing and ultra pickiness, and poo-pooing every single property I present to him for not having that "magic" or not enough "vibe." - Ugh! - Nia... I have the Garveys and Sean Robinson's land deal. Right, I forgot about the Garveys. How's that going? - It's going fine. - Good. Hey, you're going to have to take this one for the team, girl. You know, at least he's not hard on the eyes. Unlike Mr. Garvey. [LAUGHS] It doesn't make up for the rest of him. Ugh, how many more of these do we have? Two hundred. Two hundred? We know 200 people? Two hundred people we like enough to give Christmas cards to? It's networking. You're letting your day with Mr. Know-it-all dampen your Christmas spirit. I've had enough spirit to last me the year. Well, it is Christmastime. And there's no better time... for magic. Speaking of which. I guess the watch is magic now. Well, it started mysteriously. And I've been thinking about this. You know, the watch. Um, I think it means something, something more. You watch too many Christmas movies. [LAUGHS] Oh, look at that. It stopped working. Maybe it reacts to your moods. [LAUGHS] If that's the case it should be in a lot worse shape than this. My point is is the holidays are about embracing the magic. You know, Santa and little elves and flying reindeer and talking snowmen. Don't let some guy you barely know ruin it for you. No, you're right. I won't. - Pinky swear? - Pinky swear. - Pinky swear. - It's a hefty promise. [LAUGHS] - Aerodynamics in place? - Great pitch and yaw. Good weight. - One. - Two. Three. - Yes! - We all got it. I tell you Santa Snacks. You got your popcorn, your pretzels, your red and green colored candies. You got your frosty sprinkles. I still think a simple cheese plate would've been better. Honey, it's a Christmas movie. You need Christmas snacks for a Christmas movie. Why didn't you warn me about this stuff before I married him? Hey, as his best man I knew what secrets to keep. So when you're his best man does that mean you get to return the favor? Never going to happen. He's not the settling down type. - Says who? - Me. Okay, what's the longest you've ever lived in one place? Okay. Ten. Years. I've been in the city 10 years. And in those 10 years how many months have you been on the road? Yeah, you have a point. Call me clich√©, but maybe he needs to find the right person to settle down with. Exactly. Speaking of perfect match or not. Is Pine Valley Realty the only game in town? Mmm, no. But Bonnie and Nia are the best. Aren't they the ones you're using? Yeah. I just don't think Nia and I are the right fit. Really? Nia is great. I've known her since grade school. Yeah. What did you do? Okay, I may or may not have laid on the corporate talk a little heavy when we first started interacting. So basically, it's your fault. Hey, I got a lot riding on this, okay? I don't know, she just... She drives me crazy. Nia? She's always got a retort for everything. - Yeah, that is Nia. - Yeah. Yeah, and I can tell that she's judging me. Big suit from the city and all. It's almost like she is threatened. [LAUGHS HEARTILY] - By this? - Yeah, right. Okay, I don't believe that for one minute. Well, I was trying to see this one place, and she can't seem to get me in there or doesn't want to. Which place is this? Pine Valley Inn. [MICHELLE LAUGHS] What? It's her family's place. - Her family owns the inn? - Yeah. So, you might want to be a little nicer to her if you want to convince them to sell. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Okay. - Round three. - All right. All right. Aerodynamics in place. - One. - Two. Three! - Oh! - Yes! [MICHELLE] Right in my eye. I always loved the snowman building contests we had when you were a kid. Oh, they were the best. Remind me to send Malcolm a double order for his gingerbread cookies for the party. I want to make this year extra special. You're not really thinking of selling, are you Dad? [SIGHS] Because you know I would take over for you in a heartbeat if I could. I know you keep saying that but... this place is a lot of work. Your mother and I used to do it together. I know, I promise you, I'm going to buy it off of you someday. You don't need to buy it off me. But you got to retire on something. Let's take a break. Cocoa's getting cold. Yeah, it is. I forgot about the cocoa. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] Listen Nia, I know you feel like it's your duty to take over and all, but... - if this is about your mother... - No. She wouldn't want you guilt-ridden and tied down to this place. We have the memories. That will never change. This is what I want. This is what I've always wanted... to maintain the inn. I just don't want you making bad decisions because of sentiment or because of me. Thank you. Loving the inn and wanting to take care of my dad is never a bad decision. I promise you, Dad. [PATRICK] It's working again. Oh, yeah. [LAUGHS] I forgot to tell you. Yesterday it was starting and stopping for some strange reason. Wow. Isn't that something? A little Christmas magic. You and Bonnie are surprisingly alike. It's just exciting, that's all. Like your mother is joining in this year. Best Christmas ever? Best Christmas ever. Or not. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Be with you in a second. Shouldn't I at least talk to him? Oh, what's the point? [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Maybe we should hear the offer at least. I looked up Optima Getaways online. You did? A couple of their properties are quite impressive. Ugh, they're overblown monstrosities, Dad. No. They're just going to tear down the inn. - It's too important for that. - I'm just curious. Well, if you really want to sell to someone other than me, I... Of course not. Really? Okay. Well then maybe you and me sit down and have a serious conversation about it, okay? But trust me when I say... he is not the right buyer for us. [NIA] I'll see you later. [CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPS] Hey! I thought we were meeting at my office. Hey. Why didn't you tell me this place belonged to your family? 'Cause it's not relevant. It's not for sale. Now, I have a bunch of properties to present to you that actually are for sale, so... You can delete those when we get into the car. Why would I delete them? [CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPS] Because it's not for sale. Okay. Cool. Mm-hmm. And you can delete that last one too. Negative. All right. I'll be the first to admit that the listing was a bit misleading. It's not so much old-world charm as it is... - New world dilapidated. - Yeah. But, you know, we have a lot more properties to go see so... Okay, let's go see 'em. Oh. And before I forget. I got you something. What's this? It's a Santa scone from The Trading Post. Thank you, but you didn't have to do this. Oh, yes I did. And yesterday I was a bit of a jerk. Oh, well... - No. - No? Hmm. I was a jerk, right? [AWKWARD CHUCKLE] It's not an excuse but I've been told in the past that sometimes when I become anxious I tend to be overbearing. Truth be told, I've got a lot to be anxious about. You do? Why? Well, this is my first solo project at Optima. I suggested Pine Valley as the location, so this is very important for me. However, it's not an excuse, hence Santa scone. [LAUGHS] Hence, thank you. They're my favorite. A Christmas tree farm? This land is what you're thinking. Exactly. Now, I know you're going to have to build, but it's prime real estate... it has a lot of potential. I don't know. I certainly don't have it in my budget to build from the ground up. Well, what if I told you we could get it for a lot less than the list price? My business partner knows the owner. I'm sure we can get a great deal. I don't know. Not talking to you? - No. - No? - Not really. - Wrong vibe? Mm-hmm. Fair enough. So. You all right? - Yep. - Great. What was it like growing up in a country inn? Oh. Um, well, it was good. It was home. In all honesty, I don't think I really knew the difference. Not until I was about 10-years-old and a friend of mine explained to me that most people don't spend Christmas with a bunch of strangers who are renting rooms in your house. - That must have been fun. - It was. It really was. What about you? Let me guess. You must have grown up in a big family in... - Philly. - Hmm. I had like dozens of cousins. Wound up living with most of them one time or another. My parents passed away when I was a kid. Oh. I'm sorry. My mom passed away a few years ago, so... That's tough. So you understand. That's a good-looking tree, huh? You should get it. Really? Nah, I mean I already have one at home so... You don't have one at the office. All right. Maybe I'll get it. See? Maybe this trip wasn't a waste of time after all. [LAUGHS] [FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYS] Nothing perfect just yet, but I'm seeing more properties tomorrow. What about that inn that you liked? It's a bit complicated, but I'm working on it. Well, you'd better work faster. You promised everyone we'd have this locked up by Christmas. And I will. I'll have her wrapped up in a big bow just in time for Santa Claus to slide down the chimney. [ROBYN] I'm counting on you, Julian. Got it. - Hey. - Hey. Are you following me again? Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. I was just... [LAUGHS] ...walking by. I saw you in the window. Need some help? No, I'm okay. Thank you, though. Okay, maybe... maybe I do need a little help. Yeah, thank you. Bonnie went into Albany to sign some paperwork for Sean, and I told myself I was only going to get started on the tree but then... Looks like you couldn't stop. Oh, once I set my mind to something... Yeah. I'm the same way, so I understand. Hey, what's the story behind your watch? Is it an antique? Actually, it is. Passed down from mothers to daughters for generations. It's going to sound weird, but it stopped working the day my mother passed away. Really? My dad went to every repair shop within 100 miles, and no one could figure out what was wrong with it. Wow. Anyway, I wear it every holiday season now. Just like my mom did. Makes my dad smile. Well, well, well... Well, well, well, what? It appears you're more sentimental than you let on. Oh, come on. I'm not sentimental at all. Hmm? - Okay, maybe a little. - Mm-hmm. Maybe a lot a little. Okay? [LAUGHS] Hey. The hands are working. Yeah. It's the weirdest thing. It just started working again a couple days ago. Maybe that's Santa's gift to you. Oh, I wouldn't go that far. I must've jostled it and a gear got knocked into place or something. Hey, can you help me with this? So, how long have you been at Optima? Just over a year. Wow. They must really like you if they're giving you your own projects. Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying my best. - Trying not to mess it up. - [LAUGHS] I hear that. And, uh, what do you like about the job? Well, there's always a new adventure around the corner. Meeting new people, hearing about their... Magical family heirlooms? Yeah. Yes, yes. That and hearing about their lives. But you want to know what I love? What's that? Exploring. There's always a certain je ne sais quoi when you go into a small town. A certain level of magic. Hmm. Right. Magic. Hey. You got a little something in your hair. Oh, um. Did I? - Do you mind? - No. [LAUGHS] I guess this is it. Yeah. We put another ornament on this guy, and it's going to topple over. - For sure. - For sure. - Mm-hmm. - [LAUGHS] - You ready? - Yeah. Three, two, one. See? - Magic. - [LAUGHS] You know what this reminds me of? - What's that? - That warm... feeling I get when I'm at your family's inn. It's so cozy and beautiful. It's so nice and... And not for sale! Julian, you're relentless. - [PHONE DINGS] - Oh um. Oh. It's my dad. - He says he needs me. - Okay I will no longer be a distraction. I'll see you tomorrow at 9:00? - You got it. - OK. And hey. Thanks. Yeah. At Optima Getaways we aim to please. Hey Dad. Is everything okay? I got your text message and tried calling but... Oh yeah, sweetie. Sorry. I guess, I left my phone upstairs. [LAUGHS] So, what's going on? Well, I just... I wanted to take you up on your offer. Have a serious conversation about selling the inn. - Oh. - I think this could be good for us. A fresh start, no debts. Emotional or otherwise. [SIGHS HEAVILY] Okay. Okay? Yeah. Because I really do think this is what your mother would want. But are you sure? I know taking care of the inn has been difficult for you since... well since she passed. Oh Dad, I've been selfish. No. You've got enough going on. No, no, I have. It's... It's a silly little dream to think that I could take care of the inn the way Mom did, and it's not practical. I like being a realtor anyhow. It's not a silly dream. Dad, you've been delaying your retirement because of me. It's not fair to you. So... [SIGHS] You're right. Just only to the right buyer. To the right buyer. [BONNIE] Are you going to tell Julian? That my dad wants to sell the inn? I don't know. I doubt it. Hear me out. The job of the real estate agent is to... I know what the job is. But trust me, - Julian is not the right buyer. - Why not? Well, I did some research on his company last night, and Optima's smallest property can house dozens of guests. Most of them a lot more. My parents' inn can house 14. You know, maybe they could expand. Add a couple of buildings. There's enough acreage. Expand? The inn is beautiful. Why would you want to do that, even if you could? See? See? People come for the historical beauty of the building and to enjoy the land. It's about... the hiking trails and snowshoeing and the animals. It's not just square footage for some developer to fill to capacity. So, you want someone to come in but not change anything. Well, not anything. Of course not. But I would like someone to be careful with what they change. Julian seems pretty careful. Hmm, Julian is careful about not messing up his first solo project. He's only been at Optima for a year. So you're getting to know each other. [LAUGHS] No! I mean maybe a little bit. - A smidge? - A little bit. And yes, I'd like to find a buyer who'll want to maintain what my parents built. Someone who's going to want to see it last. I wish it could just stay in the family. Me too. You know as well as I do that that's just not feasible right now. Or maybe you could tell the new owners your great ideas, and they could help keep the legacy of your family alive. A very good family legacy it is. Thank you, Malcolm. That's not a bad idea. Like I've had so many ideas over the years, social media for one. My parents never got the hang of it. You've seen my dad's Instagram, right? It's just pictures of snow. Yeah, I've seen them. Very snowy. So much snow. [LAUGHS] And I'd open the dining room to the public, not just to guests, and... I'd want to partner up with some of the local businesses to have these branded experiences, especially during the holiday season. Like, um, a Halloween cooking class or sleigh rides through hiking trails, or maybe even some Christmas dinner theater. That's amazing. It is amazing. Bonnie, I have an idea. [NIA] Don't wear heels to a farm. Okay. So, I want you to keep an open mind to this. Okay. I'm officially scared. And.. voila. It's a barn. It's a barn theater. Or at least it used to be, and now it can be all yours. It's a barn. It's a renovated barn that has had many additions over the years, and most importantly, it's warm and cozy and woodsy. You know what it really reminds me of? What's that? The Pine Valley Inn. Yeah. It looks exactly like the Pine Valley Inn. - Right? - Minus the... beautiful period building. The fireplaces, the rooms. What is that, an outhouse? Yes, but that's not the point. You have to consider the location and the landscape and just the overall feeling. It's... [INHALES] aah. It's really nice here, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. We'd have to tear it all down. No, no, no. It comes with a big plot of land. So, you could actually keep the barn and build the resort around it. And why would we keep it? Well, the barn is kind of a local landmark. Has some very interesting history. Come on, I'll show you inside? Okay. [NIA SIGHS] Okay. Wait right there. Wow. See? Yeah. I guess, we could build a few loft spaces up there. Reception could go... I mean, we're going to have to expand the occupancy. Definitely need new buildings. Yes, and you have the space to do that. And in terms of this space, I mean, you could put a dining room maybe over there. But I was thinking it could stay kind of as a performance venue for weekend shows, conventions, little conventions. - Retreats. - Retreats. For small businesses. For small businesses, exactly. Lan Carol performed here? Yeah, as a teenager doing summer stock theater. I told you there's some real history here. And Nathan Lane and the most famous of all... - You acted here? - No you didn't. [LAUGHING] I did. Fifth through eighth grade, Santa's helpers: The Musical. - Hmm. - It was a smash hit. We could've gone to Broadway. - Santa's Helpers? - Yep. - Never heard of it. No. - Really? - Never heard of it? - No. - Figures, it was an original... - Ahhh. for the Pine Valley Community Players. [PLAYS PIANO] - Do you play? - Not really. But I can hold a tune. [PLAYS PIANO] [LAUGHS] Is that so? [PLAYING "DECK THE HALLS"] ‚ô™ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Fa la la la la, la la la la ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 'Tis the season to be jolly ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Fa la la la la, la la la la ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Don we now our gay apparel ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Fa la la la la, la la la la ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Troll the ancient Yuletide carol ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Fa la la la la ‚ô™ ‚ô™ La la la la ‚ô™ - [CLEARS THROAT] - What? You didn't get a solo in Santa's Helper? No. I was always chorus. - Oh, you're a lead today. - Uhh. ‚ô™ See the blazing yule before us ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Fa la la la la, la la la la ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Strike the harp and join my chorus ‚ô™ [SINGING TOGETHER] ‚ô™ Fa la la la la, la la la ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Follow me in merry measure ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Fa la la la la, la la la la ‚ô™ ‚ô™ While I tell of Yuletide treasure ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Fa la la la la, la la la la ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Fa la la la la, ‚ô™ [HARMONIZING] ‚ô™ La la la la ‚ô™ [LAUGHS] Oh, that was so much fun. You have some serious talent. Thank you. I haven't done a duet in ages. - Really? - Mm-mmm. Oh. I see you. I see you. Doing a duet. Hmm. That must be your go-to whenever you're on a date if you can find a piano. - Uh, no. - No? I haven't been on a date in a very long time. Oh, of course. Yeah, well, I mean, it must have worked when you were dating your wife or whoever you're with. No wife, no partner. Musical or otherwise. Really? Oh. Well then, who is Julian Thompson? World traveler not willing to settle down yet? Why does everyone keep saying that? I mean, I would settle down but... I haven't found the right person. Huh. A wandering soul in search of kindred spirit. Someone with... - The right magic. - The right magic. Mm-hmm. Um. So, do you like the place? It's got potential. Potential enough to put in an offer? Oh, slow down there, cowgirl. Well, can it be on the shortlist, at least? I'll tell you what. We can put it on the shortlist... if you give me a tour of your family's inn. Julian, it's not for sale! I've told you already. I know it's not for sale, but I just want to take a look at it, please! You're not going to let this go, are you? No. Okay. I'll make you a deal on one condition. Mm-hmm. - That we go right now. - Mm-hmm. Before my dad gets home from yoga class. Your dad does yoga? He does. He's actually very flexible. I can imagine. [LAUGHS] But in all seriousness, if we do bump into him, if we can just not talk about the resort. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, done. Okay. Deal? Deal. And... that's it. That's the whole place. Satisfied? Very. It's perfect. Nia, can I please talk to your dad to see if he'd consider selling? - No. You promised. - I know. But it's exactly what we needed, you know? We can keep a lot of what's here. All the stuff that works like the guest suites, although they do need some upgraded furniture. Reception, perfect. Right here we just um, blow out the walls, make it bigger. I was thinking about a lobby bar, maybe even a spa. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No lobby bar, no blowing out walls, no spa. I don't know how many times I have to tell you, but it's not for sale. What's not for sale? The uh, old mill down by the river. Julian was thinking that the mill would be a great property for the resort, but it's not for sale. Right, Julian? Who doesn't like an old mill? - Yeah. - That thing's falling apart. What you really need is something with good bones. Like this place. Well, it's too bad it's not for sale. - Yeah. - Sure it is. We discussed it. Sure I'm going to miss the place, but it's time to retire. [WHISPERS] Dad... This is Julian from Optima. Yes, Getaways. My daughter tells me that Optima generally works on a larger scale than our little place. Yes. That's typically true for all our other properties. However, we understand there's a certain level of value and charm that small town inns like this bring to business. Or at least I do. Well, isn't that comforting to hear? Why don't I give you a tour of the place? [NIA SIGHS DEEPLY] Is there something you'd like to say? Yeah. I can't believe you just did that. Me? You're mad at me? You're the one who lied to me. No, I didn't. It's more complicated than that. No, it's not. Not only didn't you tell me it was for sale, you specifically told me it wasn't. Yes, and I had a good reason. What was that? You're the wrong buyer. Why? Because you want to do too much to it. You wanna, you wanna blow out the walls and you wanna remodel the rooms and you wanna open a spa. - A spa? - Yeah, a spa. - What's wrong with a spa? - Well... Okay, that was just off the top of my head. Listen, every buyer's going to want to make changes. Maybe, but it's a matter of scale, and Optima Getaways is, well, I'm sorry, it's just not the right fit. Your dad liked my ideas. My dad is friendly with everyone. It's part of the job description. But he hasn't thought it through. Look... If you don't want to help me do this I could easily find another real estate agent. You could do that. But I must remind you I also represent the seller, and I hold a great deal of influence with him. So, you'd torpedo the deal just to get your own way? I would do whatever it takes to protect my dad from making a mistake he'll regret. Okay. - Is this about me? - What? We're not going to talk about the company for a second. Is this about me? [SIGHS] No, of course it's not. It's... look, there's just, there's a lot of factors, okay? I have a few more properties I'd like to present to you. Maybe I can convince you that there's something else better out there. Or maybe I could convince you that this is the right property and that Optima could take it into the future while still respecting its past. Well, it seems like we have our work cut out for us. Yeah. I'm up for the challenge. - Me too. - Dinner tonight? Sure. No. I mean, um... I'm... I'm... I can't. Okay. Are you busy? A date? Yeah. With someone tall, dark, and handsome. Sure he is. [LAUGHS] It's just with my dad. Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Whatever. No. We're going over our Christmas Eve party plans and you know. We have to discuss things and... [SIGHS] What about after dinner? I mean, we could do it at your office just to keep things... business. Of course, of course. 'Cause you're a client. Yeah, yeah, exactly. - [JULIAN ON PHONE] Hey, Robyn. - Hey, the barn's too rustic. But this country inn, perfect. So, what's our opening bid? I haven't made one yet. Why not? [JULIAN] It's complicated. You said that last time. [ROBYN] What's going on over there? [SIGHS] It's the owners. They're finicky. You're the one that said everything is for sale if the check is big enough. Yes, but I'm on a budget, right? And this place is going to need lots of work. Julian, I trusted you with this. Can you get it done or not? Of course. Look. Christmas is coming up. I have everyone breathing down my neck for closings. So tick-tock. I gotcha. Promise. [ROBYN] Good. Now go get 'em. [SIGHS] What about a band? We only have three days. I don't think we can find one in time. Karaoke? People want to sing Christmas carols. Maybe. If they're brave enough to get up on stage solo. - I know. - [LAUGHS] I just want this to be special. It will be. It always is. But this is the one we'll remember. This is the one we'll picture when we think of Christmas at the inn. Not necessarily. Like, I remember when I was seven or eight-years-old and you hired Mr. Richards from the post office to play Santa Claus. Right? And he literally... [BOTH] Tried to come down the chimney! [BOTH LAUGH] Or... or what about that time it snowed so hard that everybody had to stay over at the inn? - A Christmas slumber party. - Yes. That was great. See? All of our parties have been so memorable. They always will be. So, have you chosen your Christmas poem? Well actually, I was going to ask you a favor. I want one truly memorable moment for our final Christmas Eve here. And for me, you reading the poem, singing a little something with your dear old dad? Hint, hint. I'd be honored to, Dad. Ho, ho, ho! Look who it is. Hey, Malcolm. - How you doing buddy? - Good. Malcolm, this is my good buddy Julian from the city. Julian, this is Malcolm Wells. He's the owner and operator of this fine establishment. We've met. Your Santa scones are probably the best I've ever had in my entire life. And this food only makes it better. And for a small fee he'll put that in a Yelp review. Well, thank you. So are you just up for the holidays? And a little business. - Oh. - He's actually looking at buying the Pine Valley Inn. But state secret, lips sealed. You got it. And you've got fine taste. The inn is as vintage Pine Valley as you get. I've been trying to get Pat Moore to list it as a historic landmark for years. - Yeah? - Oh, here look. I think that picture was taken in front of the inn with Patrick and his late wife, Christine when she was pregnant with Nia. - Patrick looks so young. - Yeah. Oh, do you know Nia too? Yeah. She's my real estate agent. Well, that makes sense. She's the best. Mm-hmm. I gotta say, it's not just the food that's fantastic. It's the whole vibe. Really brings the town's history to life. Oh, well, history is my passion. It's kind of why I bought this place. And I'll have you know that we are on the exact spot where the first Pine Valley trading post stood. The whole town started right where you're sitting. Or at least that's what he tells everyone. [LAUGHS] No, no. Seriously, seriously. Malcolm is the closest thing we have to a town historian. Also president of the Preservation and Landmark Society. It's a volunteer position. Cooking's my day job. I've actually got a history question for you. Mm-hmm? - This pattern here. - Mm-hmm? I saw it on Nia's watch. Is it like a town symbol or something? Ah, Nia's watch, huh. Funny thing is, that's where I got the idea for the pattern in the first place. Nia's watch is famous? Oh, yeah. [SIGHS] A family heirloom with a whole lot of history. Here we go. So, the story goes that her great-great grandmother received it as a Christmas gift from her fianc√© before he went off to war. But later that year she got news that he died. And on that day, the watch stopped working. Wow. But then the following Christmas Eve there was a big snowstorm that came in. A whiteout type of blizzard, okay? And while everyone was safe inside in front of their fires, a mysterious carriage made its way through town and headed towards the inn. And so her door blew open. Okay? And there he was. The love of her life survived after all. And legend has it that the watch started working again at that very moment. Wow. Love story for the ages. And as always, coffee and snacks in the kitchen. I think you're going to love it here. I think you're right. - Oh. - Oh. - Well, you're here late. - Yeah, I... I am. What's going on? - Nothing. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Bonnie let me in early. Wow. Since we both had dinner, I figured we could use a little dessert. - A little? - Yeah. [LAUGHS] I wasn't sure what you like so I got us both apple pie and cherry pie. It was a little too late for Santa scones, so I got us some gingerbread cookies from the store. Oh, that's so sweet. And if you're feeling adventurous, Christmas movie mix from Sean and Michelle's house. That looks very interesting but very thoughtful of you. Thank you. Oh, and just to be clear, the only reason why I came earlier to set this all up was so that we could be efficient in our meeting. Yes, of course. Of course. And for the sake of total transparency, I also came ready with this. - Your dad's peppermint bark. - [LAUGHS] I saw the way you were looking at it. You mean the way that I was scarfing it down. I might have noticed. And some hot cocoa to wash it down. Mm-hmm. Looks like we have enough sugar here to keep us up all night. And tomorrow night. Thank you so much for all of this and making me laugh. It's been really nice going around town getting to know you. - Mm-hmm. - It's been fun. I didn't realize how much I needed to laugh. - And sing. - And sing, yes. [LAUGHS] Yes. And um... And I also realized how much the inn means to me. I'm so sorry, Julian. I can't let my dad sell the inn to a big corporation. Nia... I'm not here to throw a wrecking ball through your family's business. No. I know you're not. But can you guarantee that Optima won't do whatever it wants once it owns the inn? No. But I can try my best. Look. [SIGHS] Look, the honest truth is this, okay? The inn is one of the last few real connections I still have with my mom. So, I feel like I need to be particular with who takes it over. Does your dad know? Why not? Well... I'm sure he'd be reasonable. If I told my dad how I felt, he would never sell the inn and retire. And he really deserves to. He's worked so hard his whole life for us. For me. So, if you need to find someone else to help you find a property to buy then I totally understand, but I can't sell the inn to Optima. - Okay. - Okay? We can find somewhere else for the resort. You don't want another real estate agent? No! Why would I do that? I've got the best realtor right here. But your job? This can't be good for your career. Listen. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I built a career off taking your home. To be honest, I'm torn. Sure, it's great developing these prestigious properties. But after coming here and meeting you, I've remembered why I got into this industry in the first place. To revitalize communities through thoughtful restoration. If I can't do that with your family's inn, we can find another place. Thank you for understanding. [CHUCKLES] You know, I misjudged you. You did? Yeah. You're one of the good ones, Julian Thompson. Thank you so much. I love Santa scones. They're amazing. Robyn? [LAUGHS] Hello there. I was just about to call you. Have a seat. Aren't these delicious? We have to get these for the resort. Sure. And you're here because? It's almost Christmas, and you still haven't closed on the inn. Oh. I just don't think that's the right property for us. Are you kidding me? It's perfect. Okay. Look. I've spoken to the realtor, and they've decided not to sell. Did you start by lowballing them? Oh, classic rookie mistake. No. They just changed their minds. I actually think we could find some better properties. Such as? Well, I'm looking at several properties today. Give me 24 hours. [SIGHS] Okay. But if you don't find something by the end of the day tomorrow, I'm going to have to step in and make them an offer they cannot refuse. Right. Oh! Hey, sorry I'm late. I was just going to grab a... - Coffee. - Yeah. - Here you go. - Thanks. - I wouldn't mind grabbing a... - Scone. To eat. - Got that as well. - Great. - Hey, are you feeling okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm just uh, eager to get going. Is that your car? Yeah. It hasn't changed since yesterday. Let's go. [NIA] Wow, this is great. [JULIAN] Ah. It's perfect. Oh. I guess it's... Not so perfect. No. Okay um, well, we have 30 minutes until our next appointment. So uh... I've gotta tell you something. If we don't find something soon, Robyn is going to put in an offer for the inn. A big offer. But aren't you on a budget? I'm on a budget. She is the boss and she doesn't like to lose. So, so much for my independent project. I'm sorry. Working with me is really getting you into trouble, isn't it? Maybe we... What? What's wrong? You said independent, right? Independent. I have an idea. Oh, Mrs. Hahn. Enjoying your stay? Very much so. You have a lovely place. Thank you. I'm going to miss it. Miss it? Are you leaving? Finally retiring. This is my last Christmas at the inn. Really? Good for you. You know, I haven't properly introduced myself. Let me give you my card. [ROBYN] We should talk. Here we are. Pine Valley Independent. You weren't kidding. Nope. It's the oldest newspaper in the region. Almost as old as Pine Valley itself. They've just moved into another building, and you know, I never thought to present it to you because it's downtown and you had been saying woodsy and rustic. But then it dawned on me. This building, it has some real local... Character. I was going to with magic. And look, I know it doesn't have the acreage that you were looking for. However... I think with a really smart renovation it can be a self-contained resort. I mean, we are right around the corner from Main Street. - Part of the action. - Exactly. It's still just an office building. Yes. But it's an office building that is antique-y and classic and has some real local charm. Come on, let me show you inside. This property has been on the market for a number of months, so I'm sure we can get a great deal on it. I mean, currently it's just being used for little events like birthday parties, baby showers, Christmas get-togethers, I guess. But what I love about it is that there is so much space. Like I was thinking maybe you could put reception here, maybe put the dining room over here, and then you can even put a ballroom over here. There's so much space. The world's your oyster. Right? And then I was thinking the guest rooms can be downstairs. You know, I think this might actually work. And it's not too far away from Sean's new high-tech campus. Really? That would be a steady source of clientele. I'm sure your boss would love that. Maybe I could get Sean to write a letter of intent. That's a brilliant idea. Yeah. Wait till you see outside. Come on. So, just beyond these trees over here is the most incredible view you've ever seen. This could really work. - Right? - With the right amount of effort it could be quite romantic. And I was thinking just around the back you could develop an outdoor lounge space. Something with uh, maybe a gazebo, a beautiful outdoor fire-pit, maybe a little dance floor. - What are you doing? - May I? - No, I don't do photos. - Why not? Julian! Stop it! What's wrong with it? Come on, I need it for the scale. [LAUGHS] Scale, right. Yeah, sure. Photography 101. You can't get a true scale of a place unless you get a stunning real estate agent standing in the center of the frame. [LAUGHS] Oh, listen to the lyrics. Stunning, huh? Come on. It's stunning. You're beautiful. - You're gorgeous. - Okay, that's enough. - No, no. I'm not going to stop. - Stop it. I will not stop. I need to see some pearly whites. Come on, you gotta sell the place. [GROANING] Fine. Fine. - [CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPS] - [JULIAN] Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo. Yeah. Okay, my turn. Oh, no, no. We don't want to do that to anybody. I'll take a photo with you then. - Okay. That's cool. - [LAUGHS] [CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPS] Now a silly face. Mm. [CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPS] [LAUGHS] Um... You see, the thing about my job is once I make the deal someone else handles the details. So, sooner or later I will no longer be your client. That's an excellent point. But you're an up and comer and you'll be onto your next adventure. Yeah, but... Probably somewhere more exotic. In the middle of nowhere. In search of more local magic. You see, the thing about magic is it's very rare. And if you find it, you'd be a fool to let it go. [NOTIFICATION ALERT] It's my boss. [LAUGHS] It's Robyn. - We should probably go. - Mm-hmm. All of our other niche properties are located in the countryside, remote. This would be great for lovers of Americana. Like history buffs. We could decorate it just like this place. The old pictures and articles, old printing press in the basement. Think "themed bar." You're a smart and creative guy, Julian, and I... I love your passion. But it's just not as good as the inn. - Robyn... - I've already talked - to the owner. - You spoke to the owner? Yes, and I have to say I'm a little confused. You said he refused to sell, but Patrick himself is saying quite the opposite. He changes his mind a lot. He's looking to retire. Seemed pretty motivated to me. Okay, here's the thing. He and his daughter, who's also his real estate agent, are very concerned that we'll go in there and change the inn, make changes to the grounds. Based on the occupancy level, it just doesn't make sense unless we go in for an expansion. Is this his real estate agent? Adorable. It's not like that. Whatever, Julian. Just tell them what they want to hear. Give them 20 points above their asking price, and good old Patrick will be too busy enjoying his retirement to even care. The fine print in the deal will let us do whatever we want. - That's no way to do business. - We do it all the time. You yourself have helped work on deals like this all year. Yeah, but it's not a big corporate entity. It's a small mom and pop inn. They have roots here. Julian, word of advice, learn to separate the business from the personal. It will serve you well in your very promising career. Now, Patrick knows you've been working with his daughter, so he wants to make sure you're the one to do... How about I loop in Nia? She's their agent. No. No, no, no. You're going to deal with the father directly. I have laid the groundwork. I just need you to close it. Julian, I know how these things work. Can you please do this my way? Let's all have a merry Christmas. [PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] - Good afternoon. - Hey, good afternoon. Mr. Thompson. Please, call me Julian. All right Julian. You coming to the party tomorrow night? Nia said it was just family and friends. Any friend of my daughter's, a friend of mine. So, you've got to come. Okay. Thank you. Listen I uh, I came here to talk to you about the inn. I know you spoke to my boss, Robyn. Oh, yeah. Nice lady. I like what she had to say. Yes. She's very good at her job. Sounds like your company will take good care of the place. Uh, yeah. I mean, I would do my very best to ensure that Optima respected what you've built here, but I can't guarantee we won't make any changes. Well, of course you would. The back porch could sure use a new coat of paint. But I'd think twice about any big changes. My wife always said this place is... close to a historical landmark. I'll make sure the powers that be understand. Why don't we go in and chat? Maybe some hot cocoa will help us figure things out. You got hot cocoa? And some little marshmallows. Okay. Don't say any more. Come on. Say no more. Oh, come on. Look at this one. [LAUGHS] Oh yeah, we were so cute. We were so darn cute. Well, I was anyway. [NIA SIGHS] No word from Julian? No. He should've emailed me by now to let me know his boss agreed to the sale. Hey, thanks for pulling those photos of the inn. I guess, we're going to have to list it now that my dad needs a new buyer, huh? I can't believe he still wants to sell. I know, right? Oh, this is from that awful ice storm. I think we were like eight. Oh, remember everyone complained about the power being out, but we loved it? You know, living by candlelight for a few days. The ice made the inn sparkle in the woods like a fairy tale. [SIGHS] He should've called by now. No news is good news? I don't know. Thank you, sir. I guess we have ourselves a deal. A deal? What deal? We're selling the inn to Julian's company. What? Dad, you can't sell the inn to Optima Getaways. You promised. If you would let me explain... Don't worry, sweetheart. We had a nice long talk, and he'll take good care of us. But he's not... Dad, how could you make this decision without me? Because no buyer would ever be the right buyer. For once I need to do the sensible thing. I just wanted to rip the Band-Aid off and do it, you know? But is it the sensible thing? They're making a very generous offer. Money I can actually retire on in comfort. We talked about this. I need to talk to you outside. [CRYING] How could you do this? I didn't have a choice. Robyn didn't like the news building, and she was about to make the offer with or without me. But at least this way I can still try and protect the inn. No. Why didn't you tell me you were making the deal with my dad? You went behind my back. No. No, no, no. I was just trying to fix it first. Come up with a solution. If you'd hear me out, I've got... Maybe I didn't misjudge you. I've included some provisions to try to protect... [TEARFULLY] Try? To try and do what? What does that even mean, huh? You're the one who told me you do the deal and someone else handles the detail. I'm trying my best here. This is your best? Julian, I trusted you. I trusted you. You got what you wanted. I think you should go. Really? I didn't realize it would be like this, Nia. I wanted to make the decision so you didn't have to. No, it's not your fault. Julian, these developers... they can be very charming when they need to be. Let's go on in and whip up some dinner and talk it out. Maybe you'll have one of your brilliant ideas that'll make this work for everyone. It's a done deal, Dad. It's... [SIGHS] It stopped again. It did. She wouldn't even let me get a word in. She's just disappointed right now. All right, just playing devil's advocate, but how bad of a resort would Optima build? They're liable to make it look like a cartoon Swiss ski village. That wouldn't even look good in Switzerland. It's not what's right for the inn. What is right? I mean, we could expand while still respecting what's already there. Nia's big on the surrounding landscape. She doesn't want to add more buildings, so we could just build out from the main house. By "we" you mean you and Nia? We follow the roofline, add some more rooms upstairs, add a solarium next to the restaurant on the sunset side. Wow, you've really thought this through. I guess, I have. Then you need to make it happen. It'd be a shame not to. Yeah, I know. But it's not my job. I'm just supposed to buy the place and move on. Not get all... What? Settled down? Let me tell you, Thompson. Finding a place to call home... it's the best Christmas present ever. That's why I'm moving all my business here. Right. Yes. There's a spark. I love it when he gets a great idea. I got a great idea, but it's going to cost you. It's going to cost me? [BONNIE] I'm sorry. This is pretty iron-clad. [SIGHS] That's what these people are all about. Just throwing money to get whatever they want without thinking how it actually affects a community. Bonnie, there's no way I'm going to be able to come up with that kind of money. I would be willing to buy you out of your half of the real estate office. Thank you. That's really kind of you, but I don't think it'll be enough. Maybe there's a... a loophole, you know? We're not seeing. I doubt it. My mom would've known what to do. Aw, you're all so cute in that. Thanks. This was my mom's favorite picture frame. I remember when she bought it at the antique store just down the road. She used to change the photos out every year but always the same picture frame. [SIGHS] There's something in here. - What do you mean? What is it? - I don't know. It's probably an old price tag or something. Oh. It's an application to get the inn heritage certified? Did your mom fill that out? It looks her handwriting. Wait. Does this mean... I think it does. [LAUGHS] - The magic of Christmas! - The magic of Christmas! [FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYS] "Protected by the Heritage Conservation Covenant." It means that the Pine Valley Inn has historical... Well, thank you for your history lesson, but I'm quite familiar with what a heritage building is. It means that you can't change any of the existing walls. The interior ones, exterior ones. You won't be able to change the footprint. There's a lot of restrictions. Tell you what, I'm going to give you some time, time to think this through a bit better. I mean, it's clear that your father wants to sell, retire. - Mm-hmm. - And it's equally clear you don't have another buyer. Certainly not anyone who will come up to what I am offering. Even less likely given this news. And it's clear that your family has connections in Pine Valley. So, why don't we both think on that? We can reconvene later? And now I must have some more of your father's delicious eggnog. Oh, Bonnie, maybe this is all a bad idea. I mean, she's right. By registering the inn as a heritage building it's going to be really hard to find another buyer. And my dad won't be able to retire and... All we need is a Christmas miracle. And given the family in need of such miracles, I have high hopes. Is Santa coming this year? Yeah? What did you ask for? A pony? I guess Julian went back to the city. Maybe, maybe not. Hard to say. Could I have everyone's attention, please? Okay folks. This is when I usually read the Christmas poem. But this year, because it is dare I say our last Christmas at the inn... [CROWD GROANS] I'd like to invite my very talented daughter Ms. Nia Moore to join me up here to say a few words. Woo! [APPLAUSE] Thank you so much everyone for coming tonight. We have had many, many, many joyful Christmas memories here since, oh, since before I was born. I'll be honest. I'm still trying to process the idea of the inn not being a part of our lives anymore. So my dad wanted to do something extra special this year, and we will be singing a duet. It's a song we used to sing every Christmas Eve together. And I'd like to dedicate this song to those who are here with us and to those who are not. [PLAYING "SILENT NIGHT"] ‚ô™ Silent night ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Holy night ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All is calm ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All is bright ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Round yon virgin ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Mother and child ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Holy infant so ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Tender and mild ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Sleep in heavenly peace ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Sleep in heavenly peace ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Silent night ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Holy night ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Shepherds quake ‚ô™ ‚ô™ At the sight ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Glory streams ‚ô™ ‚ô™ From heaven afar ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Christ the savior is born ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Christ the savior is born ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Christ the savior is born ‚ô™ [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Thank you everyone and Merry Christmas. Oh, and uh, there's lots of hot cocoa and treats that have to be finished by the end of the night otherwise my dad will finish them all to himself. [LAUGHS] And all my yoga would have gone to waste. [LAUGHING] - Thank you. - You see who's here? And he's coming this way. [WHISPERS] He's right behind me isn't he? [WHISPERS] He is right behind you. Excuse me. There's a gingerbread man, um, eyeing me. - Hi. - Hi. You and your dad, that was beautiful. Thank you. Um, I uh... I messed up. And I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I should've came to you first and let you decide what to do instead of going to your dad and making a deal. Why did you do that? I don't know. I was afraid for you, for me, for my job. I don't know. But those are just excuses. I'm here now to make things right. Or to try to at least. Excuse me, Mrs. Hahn? We have a little problem. Yes, your daughter has already informed me. But I mean, with some cooperation from the town, I'm sure we can still make this work. Well, if by cooperation you mean Malcolm agreeing to turn a blind eye to you not acknowledging this beautiful inn's historical significance, it's not likely. I'm sorry. You are? Sean Robinson. Oh, Sean Robinson. And Malcolm is? Malcolm Wells? Well, he is the president of the Pine Valley Landmarks and Preservation Society and let me assure you, he is a stickler for the rules. So, Malcolm is declaring the inn a historical landmark. Indeed he is. And what if they don't pull the offer? The legal challenges would give us enough time to find another buyer hopefully. That makes sense. Who knows, maybe we could find financing ourselves. Ourselves? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but um... Um... I don't want to leave. I don't want to move on to my next adventure. Because I think I found it right here with you. And I'd be a fool to let you go. And you'd be willing to work with me and help keep the inn? I meant what I said. This is your home, and I don't want you to lose it. Were you not happy with our deal? Was I not generous enough? No, very generous. It's just that my daughter... Isn't keen on bending the rules. I mean, I've actually put out some feelers and I've got some strong leads. [ROBYN] That's very touching, Julian, but you shouldn't lie to the girl. Excuse me? You have no financing, no leads. And if you continue sabotaging our work, you won't have a job either. You want to know what, Robyn? I don't know if I want to work for you anymore. Actually, I don't want to work for you anymore if this is how you do business. - Well, he won't need it. - Excuse me? Oh, very soon he's going to have a beautiful resort to restore. - He's got the financing. - What? Yeah, you know. I was thinking about my new facility, and... people are going to need a place to stay when they visit so... - You'd do that? - We are doing it. [LAUGHS] Okay, wait, wait, wait. Everybody, just wait, um... Julian, I need to talk to you outside. - Mm-hmm. - Right now. - Mm-hmm. - Right now! Oh! You okay? You need a jacket? No, I'm okay. But we just met... and I don't want you to give up your career or dreams for me. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. But how? Why? Because of the magic. [GASPS] - It's working again. - Of course, it is. Mistletoe. It sure is. - Merry Christmas, Nia. - Merry Christmas, Julian. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS] [PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYS]
