What do his parents think? Devaney, where were you last night at about nine hours. Where have you been? I sat around in Handly's Joey Bennett and hit his head ... until he lost consciousness. Why ... Why did you hit that Joey Bennett. I was provoked. Look, we drank a few ... He pulls a pistol, he began He has loaned me a computer, he has been one year. So I say, give me my computer, I will give you dollars. He jumped me out of the blue and screamed for their money. So I grab the first thing I get owned. And that was the ancient Blunderbuss, I got from my grandfather. Antique what? - Blunderbuss. I showed it and then suddenly I hit with it on his head. That is cruel, I admit it.

It always takes too long, the second glass. Dostoevsky does not? - Come on, that's the biggest sinner. Gogol was good. Eventually became insane. Well sad. Can you get used here? - It's okay, I guess. They are all so damn boring. Who? - The patients, including me. I think they have the right being depressed. But why you do not yet show of it. Not a bit early to drink? You still have service. You were away all afternoon. You keep this kind of statements, Or will you tell me? More murder in the letter, the victim is a John Doe. A John Doe? - Yes, that means we do not ... I fucking know what that means, continue. The name and address were false, We have sent his fingerprints. More? You bore me. I got a call about a briefing, Tonight, a man by the FBI. Special Agent Wendell Everett. What? - Maybe it is about the murder ... and he has a psychological profile the murderer or something. It's about drug smuggling. It's either that, or they have another piece of rock stolen from the museum. Drug trafficking, that's exciting. Yes, that's damn exciting. You are standing on the damn pier In the hour-long rain ... waiting for a damn boat ... which never comes, that's exciting. Go me now get a pint. We find a 18 meters long ship, named Annabel Lee. We lost her trace three weeks ago when she left the Dominican Republic. The DEA thinks they 500 million cocaine on board. They will ... - That's half a billion guys. Half a billion. Thank you Inspector Stanton, that's half a billion, yes. Dia. The people that we think to be involved ... Francis Sheehy Skeffington, are, from Dublin. The next. Liam O'Leary, also from Dublin. The next. Clive Bruce from London. The next. And James McCormick from Limerick. These men are extremely dangerous and if ... if you ... Yes, Sergeant? - I thought only black drug dealers are. Excuse me, what? - I thought only black drug dealers are ... and Mexicans. There is one name for them ... - There is one name for you, sir ... but I will not get into. Anyway, as I said ... these men are extremely dangerous and if you ... - Courier. Drug Couriers. That was enough Boyle. Offer your apology. What excuse? - You know what. For your racist statements among others. I am a sir er, Racism is part of my culture. That was enough, put your dick for us. You're a damn nuisance. - Go back to Dublin anyway man. I pull your damn head off Boyle. - Sit down. Come on men, not where the American present. He just wants to annoy. - And deliberately disrupted my reading. I wanted some fun stairs, do not be fooled by it. Half a billion of cocaine and you think to make fun? Street value. Excuse me? - Street Value. You always say that the drugs a street value of ten or 20 million ... or half billion dollars. I want to know what street that is because in that street I buy my cocaine. That's enough Boyle, we have plenty your wisdom for today ... if you go on like you're suspended. I doubt it. - You doubt it? You dare do so to speak against multiple ... if we were in Atlanta ... - We are not in Atlanta, I guess. If we were in Atlanta, were you arrested ... you would distribute coupons to pedestrians. Boyle that was it, you are ... - You drive at three instead of four. What do you mean? - McCormick's death. What makes you think he's dead? I hope he is dead, for he is in the morgue. Schopenhauer. - I would say Nietzsche. Nietzsche, You've never read Nietzsche. Welwaar. The Antichrist. - Give me a quote. Anything that does not kill me ... - Damn, that every child knows. Bertrand Russell. - Bertrand Russell, hear what he says? English, everything must fuckin English. Name your favorite philosopher and bet that it's an Englishman. He is a Welshman. Bertrand Russell was a Welshman. - Bertrand Russell was a Welshman? I did not know, nobody will interest he was a Welshman. Dylan Thomas? - Like I said. The crowd will not cry Hosanna ... until you drive through the city on a donkey. Nietzsche. Yes that's a good one. - Nice quote. Damn. - Police. You was not speeding, you know yourself. Is there a rear piece cop? - No, no problem. Why have you kept us, damn. Excuse me? - Why have you held us? You stupid, fucking asshole. Get out, everyone. A nice friend you have. - He's English, what should you do? Identification, please. - You come from Dublin, right? Identity cards please. - What's your name? I know many agents in Dublin. You know many agents in Dublin? - He's a very kind man. It can not hurt to be friendly, what's your name? Let's end it. What's your name? McBride. - McBride, who I do know. We have no McBride, Liam? - Yes, Francis. Should we use our real names? - It does not matter now, Liam. You're right. We know everything about your McBride. You know nothing of me. - Stand McBride, it makes no sense. Stand McBride. Turn around Be a good boy. No, I take it as it comes, if you approve it. That shows what a coward you are. - As you wish. He took it well. - He was very philosophical about it. And, are we going? - We need to dump the body. I do not do physical work. - Come on. No, when I applied for a job and international drug smuggler ... there was nothing about desired experience in heavy lifting. To the west. - Were you already in Ireland, Wendell? No, I can not say. - Where are you from originally? Original? Wisconsin. And where in Wisconsin? Canosia. - Canosia, Wisconsin. How do you find in Tennessee? How do you know I was in Tennessee? Where were you stationed, when you're behind the Knoxville ripper assembled together. Have you done research on me, Sergeant? You'd do the same to me. Sorry, I had no time for. Of course, you are busy, I know. You know where I would go like? - No, where would you like to go there? Tupelo, the King's birthplace. - Mississippi. My wife is from Jackson. How long have you been married? - Eight years. Children? - Two boys. Stoke's five years Huey's and three months. I have a picture. - I do not want to see. Excuse me? - I do not want to see. Babies all look the same. The only time a baby not at all like other babies ... is like a really ugly baby. So if you do not want to show ugly baby, then I do not see. That's pretty rude. Maybe, maybe not. - It certainly is. I also would love a family. I am too much on the road and working on it now. I do not think you should tell me this. I proofread it, they are smuggling cocaine from Colombia with small submarines. Submarines built by themselves. - Yes, it sounds crazy, but you're right. Smart creeps, you must respect for their entrepreneurial spirit. No, sergeant, you must not. - Well that. Have you ever been in the States? Yes, one time in Disneyworld. As a child, your family or something? - No, this was last year. Your girlfriend? - No, I do not. You're only been to Disneyworld. Yes, it was fun. I came in the picture with Goofy. Goofy is my favorite. I do not know whether you're damn stupid, and damn smart. Sergeant Boyle? I think something has gone wrong girl This is the wrong night. Excuse me? - You're in the office? No, my husband is missing. God, I'm sorry, come on. I'm just a little less comfortable. A nice cup of tea. So you said your husband was missing, I have not heard your name. So. - I think my husband is missing, yes. Name? - Aidan McBride. Aidan McBride. Not the agent Aidan McBride? Yes, he says he works today. How long has he been missing? - Since tonight. That's not long, maybe he is somewhere to get a drink. He does not drink. He does not drink. - He called for eight hours, on the way home. I called his mobile, but I can not touch. There are no accidents been As far as I know. I'm just at home. Could it have something to do with work? You mean he has gone undercover the mafia? No, that sort of exciting things You need to Limerick. How long have you been married? - Three years. Where are you from? Romania? - Croatia. Croatia. Good footballers the Croats. That they were anyway. Listen, I'm sure that an innocent explanation. If tomorrow we still have not heard that's 24 hours ... then I do go out an APB. What did they even on TV again? Excuse me? - APB. I let out an APB go. Nowadays you never hear that anymore, right? Thanks again. - Good luck. Goodbye. It's chilly outside, huh? I'm impressed, Sarge. I was fourth at the Olympics. Nonsense. - Seoul in '88. I love the South Koreans, great food. Nonsense. - No, the 1500 meters freestyle. I went for bronze, but the two Germans I was not ready, that damned Salnakov? He had his top back should be. They never know when they are defeated, the Russians. Samples were they called golf. You were fourth at the Olympics? - You get nothing for fourth place. It's a cruel world. Wisconsin Canosia you said ... You grew up in the slums? - What? Are you grew up in the slums, or had they not Canosia Wisconsin. No, I did not grow up in the slums. It will surprise Sergeant Boyle, I have a privileged background. And I mean "University", Yale. I had a Rhodes scholarship. You do not even know what that is. - I know what a Rhodes scholarship is. Yes, tell. - Kris Kristofferson. Yes, Kris Kristofferson was a Rhodes scholarship, you're right. Privileged background, eh? Summers in the Hamptons, Skiing in Aspen, that sort of thing. Skiing, huh? I thought that blacks could not ski. Or was it swimming. What have you planned for today? We do not know who killed McCormick and why ... and there are no useful forensic traces at the crime scene ... So I thought we could comb the neighborhood ... where the body was discovered to see if anyone has heard anything. And we must take into the fact ... that McCormick sought a spot on the coast to deliver the drugs. Sergeant? Sorry, I got lost you when you 'we' said. We, you and me. This is my day off, I tell you? This is your day? It's been a while planned Stanton question it. I have this right? We investigate a murder ... and transporting half million ... - Bill. half billion of cocaine and you say you're free today. These 24 hours will make no difference. 24 hours will make no difference. They always say that police series on TV, but I have no experience ... Besides, why repeat everything I say? How are you madam, FBI Special Agent Wendell Everett ... may I ask you a few questions? There is a black one for the door. You do not speak English? What can I do for you? And you speak no English. This is Ireland. go to England, if you want to speak English. I want a few pictures to show and ask if you have seen those men ... during the last few days. This man. - No, though that so I would not say it. You must apologize, I need a lamp repair. It was a birthday present from my aunt in Australia. Good day. Is there anyone that I ... Where are you taking us with you for your games? I booked a room in the G. I have not cut back on. - Are we not ... officially for the G? Whether they like it or not. Then they do with Sergeant Boyle. He is a powerful man. - They say that power does corrupt. I'm certainly corrupt, that you will soon enough. Are you the FBI guy? - Yes. The Behavioral Science Unit? No, I narcotics smuggling investigation. - Drugs. What are you doing, come on down. You have no poor condition for an old man. That's what my mom always. - Sergeant! You should not listen to her .. I could be your father. There you can think of when you fuck us, when it gets excited. Sinead, you have a sick mind. I'm in love. What was that click? - A snapshot sergeant, look. That you stop in your archive. - I put some in your archives. The man is obsessed. A wonderbra. - I confess, I have small breasts. And I have a very small penis. Sgt. How are you sir. Special Agent Wendell Everett. Sir? Sir? Have you seen him here? What about this man? No? You speak no English? This is life. - I assume you're happy with the service. I am exhausted, I have no energy. Then you have a good evaluation at the agency business. Yes, five stars. I just wish that I had brought handcuffs. There is always a next time. - Are you in for bondage? Only for you, sergeant. Only for you Well damn. I do not understand. Just because he does not courage, why then he commits suicide. It is the perfect location for suicide. Many local people have drowned here. Therefore we should now that prima donnas do now engaged. I do not think he committed suicide. Neither do I. He was not smart enough. If it is not suicide, it is a crime. Crime? - Murder or manslaughter. I can think of no one who Aidan would like to do harm. He's a cop. Someone must have had something against him. It's a better theory than suicide, in my eyes. Can you tell me something that can provide a clue. lets personal. - He is gay. He is gay. So, if a man ... - Yes, I know what it is. I had not thought of. Do you think he has met someone and that would do him harm? A, you know, what do they normally? A gigolo? - Yes, a gigolo. No, there is no gigolos, to my knowledge, but maybe in the city. Why did you marry him? For your visa, I suppose. It remains among us. - Yes, I have the visa, and he looked ... Respectable? - Yes, from respectable. Nice clothes, can you tell jokes? - Fuck you, sergeant. A bottle of whiskey and a double while I wait. And you? - Guinness. Two Guinness, bartender. If the fat man said: If you are careful should be, not too much to drink ... it is because you can not be trusted, if you do, Did you find anything? - Nothing. People here ... I know it's like in Compton? - Exactly, they tend not to talk to the police. Most people do not even speak English. - They speak enough English, Gaelic. Have they not learned that in Langley? - No, they have not taught me in Langley. For the simple reason that, Langley, the CIA, idiot, not the FBI. You did not know that people in western Ireland, Speak Gaelic, so who is the idiot? Whatever. How was your day? - Energetic. Listen, there's something great to bear and it is not my penis, I'm talking about. One of my men is missing, Mc Bride. His car was found on a known suicide instead, he was in service. Are there signs of a crime? - Not as far as we know. You think about suicide is not clear that it is So what are you thinking? First, McCormick murdered. And now a policeman lost, it is too coincidental. - It may be that he saw something and was ... Murdered. - Kill, yes. His first day at work, talk about bad luck. Yes, where do we start? We start with these two and hence on the deal. "Slainte" that's Gaelic. What was the first thing that you solved? - Theft of ostriches. What? A man stole ostriches, and transported them abroad. For eggs, I think. It is not like crack. Have you ever tried crack? Do you think I should tell you that? I have taken. - Again, you must not tell me. They say that if you take it once, then you're hooked. That is nonsense. That's propaganda that they tell the children. You're an unconventional cop. - Thank you. That was not meant as a compliment. - I know, you just make a joke. What's so interesting? I think I had had a nepmelding, for those who had killed McCormick ... a boy named Billy Devaney. Devaney's Who? Italian? - Yes. Devaney said he was in Hanlies that night, and that he hit Joey Brennan together. So? So I thought, the one who committed the phone, was there that night. Saw Billy ... - Did Billy Devaney, Brennan attacks ... and decided to blame him for McCormick. Exactly. That's a nice slap. He goes for it. - Hey, stop it, rinse it once again. Damn, it's Sheehy and Cornell. You see, they're there. If an ass fucks a hippo, it's time to party. What? If a donkey fucking a nijpaard, it's time to party. What are you talking about? - Sheehy said. He took you into the grind, damn. - Is this real leather? What do you think I'm cheap? - It's all there? What you say. - It's all there? No, not really, I have a few thousand out of it. What? Of course it is true. This is bribery. We buy for you, you hold your nose of our business. That's the idea. Why should I cheat with the money? Why would I do that? That is not right. Then this entire meeting been useless. Someone with a bad leg stepped out of bed This morning, fuck Englishman. The big city boys. These are the three main ports? - Yes. Barna. Many Rossa and Spiddal. Okay. We put three teams in those places. - Roger. Then we search the coast from start to finish. A large map? People reject. It must be important. And I want the teams, working up the coast meter by meter. We can do this in 48 hours ... - Now I know it? Excuse me a moment. Sorry, I do not want to offend. - If you've ever so tightly packed again ... You never talk to me like, Sergeant Boyle. Now you have your zombies around you, with mobile phones and computers. It must be really thorough go. We try to work together, an important issue. What I need you ... - What do you want? A cup of coffee? Boyle, a small child wants to talk. - Most likely his cat in the tree. You'd better take. For convenience, we ... Where is it? - That further. They have him well hidden. Sloppy. They are here until it got dark come it's a lonely job, in the night. There are probably spirits and things like that. Poltergeists. I know nothing about poltergeists, here's nothing to save. What were you doing here anyway? - Heroin. You get along with the belt, if you so continue, help me out here. What? - You've caught something - No, I have nothing. You've caught something, you do not even look surprised. - Always only the allegations. Admit it, you little blow. Do not let me search. You think that everything can, if you give me search is then I'm going to sue. I will save a lot on your head, Eugene? I will do. No more questions. What do you do? It's small. It's a Derringer. Booth used the Abraham Lincoln to shoot. That can not be damaging. - It gets the job done, I've heard. I do not understand what the IRA does with it. - Maybe to small to kill Protestants. Small Protestants killing that's funny. I hate dirty cops. - Have they tried anything then? No, they have not tried. - What's the problem? I am sick and tired of the kind of people we have to deal with. What did you expect? We smuggle drugs. Dalai Lama is likely not participate in the fun. That's the point, right? It has no sense. It's so pointless. The money? - Yes, the money. How much do you need to be happy? The whores. - The whores, of course. I reached a point in my life where I am looking for a meaningful relationship. I understand what you say. Monogamous. There is an agent that Stanton does not guarantee can stand for, he is unpredictable. Nothing to say. Let me guess. Boyle. Yes, that's him. I love sharks. They are calm. It did not matter. What do you need to confess your age? - What has that to do with my age? Pol Pot, had passed seventy when he died. Yes, but the deeds of Pol Pot, what is going on ... what you have on your tally. You know all. - Maybe. Have you participated in a sex orgy? Or maybe drunk? Stop it. - Or a hooker in the ass shot? But how is it the police? There is a guy from the FBI here. Behavioral science unit? - Drugs. Yeah, I guess. - Yes. What drugs? - Cocaine. Cocaine? I would that cocaine use. They say it's very nice. - It makes you awake. It also helps you with the girls. That love that stuff. Can you blame them? - That's true. What do you think of amyl nitrate? - What? What is amyl nitrate, which does that to you? What do you think I am? A fucking drug fan? Why the sudden interest you? I do not know. I feel I've missed something. Did you miss amyl nitrate? No, I mean in general. - We've all missed something. That you're not alone. What goes in your head at? Come, tell me. I figured that I just do not ... I listened to music, long time. Live music, you know ... lrish like folk music. If so, can I something out tonight. You really want to do? - There will be something good going on. It's not that hard to make you happy. That said, they told me during the orgy. You certainly have a fight, huh? - Yes. Who did that? - Just a guy. Just a guy. Not such a nice guy then. I know few nice guys. - I would not say so. You have a very pessimistic picture of the world. Take only two. Chocolate. Why are you back in Gallway? That can not be good. These are those pictures. What photos? - That we have made in the G What is it? I should say that you need to calm love, if you know what's good for you. And if I do not, then what? Book you have some progress or what? Sheehy, Sergeant Boyle. So it was a trap. How about that? - I know it's just coincidence. I heard rumors that one guy in Gallway was ... with a weakness for prostitutes. I decided my advantage of it. Very opportunistic to me. I'm crazy for this song, man. What they hell the bridge thrown Tallahassee? I always thought it was a baby. - Yes? It can be a weapon. Anything really, when you think about it. You never know with those guys. It would be very mysterious. I get goosebumps. Whatever it is. You know where I get goose bumps? Motherfuckers who beat up women. I was not. That one of the enthusiastic young people. Cornell and O'Leary? - You are well aware, Sergeant. I'd like to be informed, like you. I am not a supporter of the strike women and to be honest ... not blackmail. So if an extra motivation ... Please. This would redeem me? Then you have every guy to buy off the west coast. All bribed? - Not if it is not worth the effort. Even Wendell? - He was ... Oh, the Yank. No, I decided that discretion but the best. You know how Americans are with their damn ideals. I will be very clear. This is a one-time offer. If you told me you had it goes. And not just for me. It's not about if you arrest me. There are men in the background. Do you understand? I understand Sheehy. I understand it. That's great. Goodbye, amigos. Are you all right? Who always give me milkshakes such a damn headache. I hate them. What do you do now? It's good, I think of something. When you hear that someone is liquidated, by the Mafia or something. What does that mean anyway? - That they are killed. What else could it mean? - Yes, I know, but ... Does that really they In fluid changed? Changes in fluid. No, just killed. Someone in the liquid to change is too time consuming, eh? It takes forever. Mrs. McBride. - Did you find him? No, I'm sorry, we ... We wanted to have some questions, please. I thought Sergeant Boyle ... - He was removed from the case. Why? - A question of competence. He is not in his head. Inspector Stanton, I do not Mrs. McBride that we ... in this discussion should involve is not it? Okay carousel, you know more than me. Sorry, we wondered whether A reason might be ... you know why your husband for has chosen to disappear. No, I'm Sergeant Boyle, I know all about it. I understand it. - Did he take bribes? I do not understand. - McBride ... he took money from people? Gangsters or something? He's a good man, why would he ... No, no ... Of course he's a good man. They are all good men. Why are men. He appears in the west, while with a gang of drug smugglers ... plans for half billion of cocaine the country to bring. And before disappearing. There's a catch. Inspector Stanton. - Would you say that my husband's criminal? No, we do not claim ... - I say that for the money ... is often a blind eye. And finally he comes from Dublin. I thought you my husband tried to find, but you insult me. Mrs. McBride, I want my sincere apologize for the bluntness ... I talk only with Sergeant Boyle. Do not come to my workplace. Mrs. McBride .. - A good day. - Mrs. McBride if I may ... Touchy, huh? So are they that Romanians. Sgt. - Collin. Want one? - What are they? I do not know. I got them from a Libyan. All colors, look. - I just skip over, Collin. I love that purple, that give you a fresh feeling. Please, let's see what brings us. Who found them? - A boy. Will we have no problem with that? - No, he's a good boy. He's been a little disturbed, so it does not matter if he says something. So that's it? - Yes, that's the problem. There were two Kalashnikov's, 2's Glock Derringer and a must have. What is a Derringer? - A small pistol. One of those gay boys wearing ... Wore a hidden on his body, you know. Are there gay people in the IRA? - A few. That was the only successful way in order to infiltrate MI5. What? I mean, an AK47, an Glock and a Derringer, then you just do not lose anything. Have you any idea what happened with it? Maybe they have eaten the mice. What? - Maybe eaten by mice. I can not put my report that the mice have eaten them. No? - Not really. Why do not you in your report ... Sergeant Boyle, has done its best ... to give you a damn happy. And he was angry, when you began to ask questions ... sucks about missing weapons. And me trying to trick, if I a damn 'nono' am. That's really not necessary. - You got your explosive, right? It's not that you suddenly are about something, right? Australians accidentally blow up is more example, your way of doing things. No, wait, that's not necessary. I did not get angry. I offer my apology. Can we leave it there for? I accept your apology, Collin. But I do have something of your credit. Because I so did my best. I'll have to ask the highest authority Is that still there? - There is, yes. Then I could ask more. The boot is on the other hand, Collin. Jesus. I will now always. Nothing. If that's tomorrow night so ... it may proceed. I hate that shit. - What? American expressions. It may proceed. And the guard? - Well, that's a separate. Is that the right word for that? - I do not think so. Why? - I do not know with that guy. The extortion, seemed not to disturb. And he has not accepted the money. I'm impressed. - Me too, I must say. I wish him every success. Integrity that you will often in our business. Keep watching him. - Yes, we can not have. We must ensure that he is not in the road. Why do I always do? - Because you're a psychopath. A sociopath, psychopath no, that's explained to me in the madhouse. What's the difference? - I do not know. That is complicated. So ... What does Dr. Olelewu to you? What did he say? He will not be happy, I'm having a party. I said I would let him deported if he makes trouble. You're terrible. Are you all right? Thanks, you've taken me out, Gerry. You're a good boy, that was always already Stop it there. You never worry bearded. Hold on, we both know it's not true. Let's do it or it is. Beautiful music, huh? We have checked the issue room. It lacks nothing as far as we can see. She probably together spared. She was always polished. She left no note behind? She did not note behind. There was nothing more to say. To Gerry. He eventually dies. Sad. Love, your mother. She was a proud woman. She was a brave woman. She was my mother. Thank you. I'm sorry about your mother. I have my father a few years ago lost. At that moment I realized it does not, It was only later that I ... It's hard, huh? - Yes. Yes, it is. So, what's going on? The research? Reliable intelligence say they are now in Cork. Who in Cork? - Connell, O'Leary and Sheehy. Where did that information come from? - Protected resources. Protected sources? - Yes. The auxiliary stops in this area, We will concentrate the operation in Cork. So you go away? - Yes. There is already another agent. I'm going there tonight. I thank you for all your help. Really, it is very much appreciated. Pay attention to yourself, Wendell. I will do. Good luck. - See you again. No, leave it turned on. I like Chet Baker. You would a dog or a parrot to buy, maybe. lets you warn. Ned Kelly was a peacock. - I was thinking more of a giraffe. A giraffe? That would not work. I mean ... then you put a dome must place or so. They're too expensive. Go sit down there. I thought you were in Cork. It's called disinformation in the intelligence world. Disinformation ... - Disinformation, smart. Are you still in Vale Rossa, so? - Close, Spiddal. You know, I'm not sure I You need to murder ... or just tie. So you do crazy things. You have some rope and ... what do you call it, duct tape? Maybe in the barn below. Of course. I do not walk around there now, in the middle of the night. You could leave me alone, eh? Why did you, McCormick murdered? If I may ask? We thought he was an FBI informant. - Did he was an FBI informant? But he appeared not to be. That was unfortunate for Mr. McCormick. Better to be sure, right? That's true. You can not be enough with your work. It's a hard life. Not everyone understands that. Therefore I take pills for stress. Lithium. As you may be careful with them. You okay, there? I think I have risen slightly. Schimmeltje one of the whores, eh? They were two girls ... I let myself be carried away some. Without a contraceptive do you have chance. We've all been there before. Where do these girls come from? Not here in the neighborhood. Dublin. - Dublin? Then it's your own fault. It would be nice if we what had to dip. While making a decision. Yes, some nachos and guacamole. I mean, we can sit here a while. - No, we will not sit long. This will soon be over. What happened to McCormick? - To simply confuse you. Why five and half? - I do not know, I was drunk. They eat you alive, the creatures. - Was also positive for McBride? No, that was random. He kept us with no reason. He should not interfere. - What have you done with the body? Dumped into the sea. The fish would have eaten him already. Not bad, huh? Get away with two murders. You're not already gotten away. I admire your faith, Sergeant. And I admire yours. Damn. I think I'm done with you. - I think so too. Are your lights yet? - Do not mock me. You deserve it. There are so many things I wanted to do. Like what? Running with the bulls through Pamplona? Special Agent Wendell Everett. Gerry Boyle. - Hello, Boyle. How are you? Where are you? - I am now almost at Gallway. You have to come back. It happened tonight. Cork is a distraction. Look, Sarge, I know you enjoy have had from the Americans ... No, it's no joke. I came to O'Leary. You came to O'Leary? - Yes, he came to me, I shot him. You shot him? - From self-defense. Is he dead? - Wait. Yes, now. No, that can not be right. They come from Cork. You know better. See you later. Idiot. He's dead. - I think so too. Did he commit suicide? - No. He was murdered. Was he murdered? - They shot at him and threw him into the sea. I have been charged with a criminal. Now I'm behind the others. I just want to say sorry because I did not know better. You're an amazing woman. Goodbye. Gerry? He takes his time to that. - Yes. I thought his love for for torture was over. I guess you never comes up. - What do you mean? It's not a hobby, right? It's a psychological problem. Quite possible. These hills will kill me. Let not fall, OK? Where did you find three? Through an advertisement in the newspaper. Under the heading 'accomplices sought. What did I tell you. - I'm here? Good man. Listen, I called reinforcement. - Why? Why? If we do not receive reinforcement, we both die, that's why. There's nobody coming, it's just you and me. What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking. They would not ... They do not ... 500 billion, Wendell. 500 billion. It's just you and me. - Damn. Indeed. That probably explains that sample here. It's for you. We can not shoot with a Kalashnikov, that will lead to international complications. We must. I have coverage. - Why do you need coverage? I go down and arrest those guys for the murder of James McCormick ... and Aidan McBride. And for smuggling cocaine. Yes, Wendell? - I want to make a point. That's suicide. - I know. Even if I get away, they come back me and they leave me alone. Not like you, you can go back to the U.S.A. But where should I go? That's the problem with the leather. They never forget. But I'm going down. I know what you think. You think that men are armed and dangerous. And you FBI agents are accustomed to unarmed women and children to shoot. Fuck you, Sergeant. Will you help me now or not? Have you ever wanted a shot? - Yes. Does it hurt? - Does it hurt? No, not at all. Of course it hurts. How about now? Need more ammo? They say the shock the pain away. - Who are they? I do not know. They say it simply. - It hurts, okay? It's very painful. - Damn. Okay. How many times have you been shot? - Three times. Three times? Jesus. That's just you have. Is there someone I should call if ...? - No, there is none. Just give me a medal as soldiers home from Iraq. Fuck you, Sergeant. Thanks for coming back to me to come help, Wendell. I appreciate it. Goodbye. This must be a joke. It is the agent. I am Sheehy and Cornell. The rest can go if you have no business with it. That means solid "no". Let's get out of here. What are you doing? This is better than Christmas. Come here. Good shot. A flesh wound. Stop, I surrender, dick. Boyle. Boyle. A lucky shot. - Not at all. Now be a bad loser. However, not every day you lose 500 billion. It was 200 million. - They always exaggerate. I knew it. You know nothing about nothing. You stupid little man. I think I did right. Compared to you, Francis Sheehy. And your friends. Who shot up there with that gun? - The guy from the FBI. He has not had much fun since They have burned all the children in Waco. Fucking O'Leary. - He was not the sharpest guy. The Englishman was not much better. You had to hire Colombians. They are good workers. I do not beg to help me if that's what you wait. I know how to die. - Good for you, Sheehy. Goodbye. Damn. Are you in the newspaper? - My goodness, no. Asshole. - That was good. That can be used for your book. - Which book? Americans write books about everything. And you sell it later as a movie. A typical story, right? Lots of action, a little humor ... and if a child is involved, you'll be fine. You need a happy ending. - A happy ending? Do not have billions and stop drug trafficking three drug traffickers made them perish? What more do you want a happy ending? - We lost a good man. I would not be so sure, They have no body found. The ocean is big. He's dead. He was burned or drowned. - He was a good swimmer. Sorry, boy, that was nonsense. He has never participated in the Olympics. Perhaps, it can easily look up. I can not say if you very stupid or very smart. Translated by Simply Releases Toppers Jopie123, depository, and TackleR Jack The Ripper
