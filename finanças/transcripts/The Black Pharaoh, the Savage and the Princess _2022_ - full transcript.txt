Storyteller, what story will you tell? The one you'd like. I’d like one that happens in Egypt. No! In Sudan. No, in Morocco! - No, in Auvergne! - Where's that? - Where I was born. - There are no tales there. Yes, they have a lot. If they didn’t have any, I’d make them up. A story with a woman. - No! First with a man. - Where they love each other. Yes, but others won’t. - With costumes! - Jewellery! - A serious story. - A fantasy! With a huge army. - With a song! - No killing! - With a red ball. - A red crown. Anything at all! - A camel! - With princesses! Enough of princesses! - With an executioner. - That’s not right is it? - A sweet life. - Doughnuts. Stop! She can’t put all that in! Yes! You've given me ideas. And for many tales… Will you tell several? Yes. People with one story have little imagination. Anyway, I’d be bored. Us too. - In the land of Kush... - Kush? It was a kingdom in Sudan, 3,000 years ago. Imagine being inside a palace. A woman in lovely clothes, but she's not nice at all. What's the name of this tale? Actually, I’m hesitant between two titles. "Tanoukamani and the Gods" Or maybe shorter is better… "Pharaoh" No! Tanoukamani, you’re too small a king, to claim the divine Nasalsa... The most beautiful of all... my daughter. My country's as big as yours. Nasalsa is too great for you. She’s the daughter of a god. And only Pharaoh is worthy. You’re joking... Nobody thinks about us up there. Only Pharaoh will marry Nasalsa, the most beautiful of all. - But I… - This conversation is over. - Tanoukamani… - Nasalsa… Now that my father is dead, my mother makes him a god... to betray him! As wife of a god... ...she is more powerful. And I’m made harder to get. Your father wanted our union and that of our two countries. She… gives you to Pharaoh! No! We are too far away. She knows that Pharaoh will never hear of me. So why say that she will marry you to Pharaoh? So I never get married and she retains power. Because, if I got married, she'd no longer be regent... ...and I’d be queen. You are my queen! Become my pharaoh. You’re making fun of me. like your mother? My mother speaks of Pharaoh, so I don’t get married. Become a pharaoh so I can marry you. - You're crazy! - No! I love you and I believe in you. You are a young king... but you've already conquered provinces, and you've kept them. For your infantrymen and your archers are also masons and gardeners. Oh, Khnum, god of the waterfalls and maker of our bodies... ...accept these flowers and advise me. Tanoukamani, why do you ask me for advice? Your girlfriend already gave it to you. But will I succeed? Who lives will see. You made me offerings and you maintain my temple. As long as you’re in my province, I’ll look after you. But why all those big moves? Tomorrow, we’re going to conquer Egypt. I will be… Pharaoh. Egypt… We are in Egypt, to conquer her! What madness! Thank you, noble vizier, for accompanying me, despite your disapproval. You are my king. I fear this journey… but here we are. I will devote myself to it with all my might. Thank you, my noble vizier. Our warrior builders will do wonders. -And the gold of the land of Kush. I wonder what Nasalsa is doing right now… You've no idea what it takes to rule a whole country. You're winning because I've got many other things on my mind. I'm winning because I played a lot with Tanoukamani. I hear your Tanoukamani has already abandoned his country. I knew it! He wasn’t big enough… You got out of it nicely. I didn’t expect to find this poverty. But where is the army? Far north. Where there are attacks by the peoples of the sea. And where Pharaoh lives. See to the horses. Let us build water-cranes, to moisten the soil... so it can be seeded. And have the temple of great Osiris restored. O great Osiris... god of Purity and Eternity... receive these flowers and advise me. Advice about what? Khnum already gave you advice. You just conquered a province without a problem. Keep going. But will I succeed? -Who lives will see. You did well by my city and my sanctuary. I’ll look favourably on you until the next province. Who are you writing to? Who could I write to? To your wretched Tanoukamani. I don’t know where he is. And you wouldn’t allow a messenger to take it. Or any to come. I’m just practicing an art that my father taught me. Phooey! That was one of his fantasies! But a princess doesn’t need to know how to write. The scribe is there to write what she says. Thebes… Karnac.… Those troops are running away... but they're keeping together, so they're dangerous. Yes. But it's the priests of Amon who have true power... installed in the largest temple in all of Egypt. With a walkway to Aries and a portico plated with gold, with Lebanon cedar, perfumed with the myrrh... and the doors be made of electrum, for the glory of the great god Amon-Ra, Master of the Thrones of the Two Lands! O, Amon... god of victory... king of the gods... accept the praise of your home and receive these flowers. And advise me. What advice? Osiris already gave you advice. My priests are working to decide your fate. But will I succeed? Who lives will see. Tanoukamani, we've been watching you. since you came to Egypt. The Pharaoh of Memphis is far away and weak. You are here and you're determined... and… generous. You’re the pharaoh we’ve been waiting for! Tanoukamani... Amon, Sun to the Horizon, Pharaoh of Upper Egypt! Bow down... ...before the son of Amon-Ra, the Lord, the Lord of the gods! If only Nasalsa could see me… A princess does not fish! I have so many good fishing memories with my father and Tanoukamani… Forget these men! They don’t exist anymore. You have the white crown. Enjoy your country, Upper Egypt. Tomorrow you’ll be in enemy territory... For the Land of the Red Crown will resist. We're coming to the Land of Isis... the sovereign goddess of the gods. Long live the pharaoh! Long live Tanoukamani, our new king! Long live our new pharaoh! Glory to Tanoukamani! Oh, wise Isis... sister, wife, mother... Advise me! Advice abut what? Amon already gave you advice. -Will you help me to conquer the next province? You have behaved well to me. I’ll protect your way, as long as it’s in my name. Who lives will see. But the journey is over. Memphis is approaching. The capital of Lower Egypt shelters the pharaoh... who remains invisible, but which is defended by an army ready to destroy us. -The protector of the province is Sekhmet, goddess of Re’s wrath. O mighty Sekhmet, queen… Tanoukamani, master of Upper Egypt, Like of the others, you ask me what to do? No. No advice? I know what to do. Make war… and win it! I like that answer. Will you protect me? I protect those who quell their fears and those who think. Who lives will see! -Their army seems like an unyielding wall… My body trembles a little... but I’m ready. Our well-placed archers are ready to let go with a barrage. - We don’t see their pharaoh. - No, it will happen without him. This is all stupid. Warriors, stop! What's he doing? People of Memphis... Where is your pharaoh? He is safe in the city that we are defending! Soldiers of Memphis... You know the reputation of the archers from the land of Kush. They just positioned themselves on either side of your battalion. On both sides of you... ...are our archers... who never miss their target. In front of you ...our foot soldiers, ready with their long javelins. Behind you, the city walls that cut off your retreat... I claim to be your new pharaoh. Am I going to start, by killing my own subjects? The wealth of the nation? And slaughter part of my army? For I know your valour! Generals of Memphis... soldiers of Memphis... Princes of Memphis... priests of Memphis... people of Memphis... The gods are with me! I don’t want this battle! Surrender... and I will give you many blessings! Our former pharaoh has just fled by sea. Tanoukamani... ...blessed by the gods... We accept becoming your subjects! And we recognise you... ...as pharaoh of the Two Lands! Long live Tanoukamani... ...blessed by the gods... ...master of both countries. I congratulate you. Oh, my pharaoh! The gods helped me all the way… It’s an illusion. The gods have never done anything for you. You did it alone, inspired by Nasalsa. It seems that a pretender approaches to ask for my hand. Yet another pretender who’ll fall flat on his face. Mother... the suitor and his men are approaching to the city… He must wait for me to be ready. Where does he come from? From Egypt. From Egypt? Yes, said the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh? He is begging you to receive him outside... ...for the door of the palace is too small for him. Tanoukamani? Thank you, noble regent.... ...for preserving Nasalsa for me, the most beautiful of all. You shall still have every right, when you retire. Nasalsa, come here. I am Tanoukamani, pharaoh of the Two Lands. This is Nasalsa, Queen of Egypt! Long live the queen! Long live Nasalsa! When we've liked a story... ...we don’t want to talk right away. We have to let it settle in to us for a bit. Yes. I’ll move gently into the next tale. We’re getting closer to our time. The Middle Ages, six or seven centuries ago. At first, the tale's not very cheerful. It’ll get better later. Imagine a castle in Auvergne. In the castle, a large room. In the large room, a little boy. What’s the title? Beau Sauvage. Gillyflower... Gillyflower... You’re boring me with this song! - Get out! - Yes, Father. Go play in the yard... where I can’t hear you anymore! -Prisoner, Will you give me the ball back? Thank you, prisoner. Gillyflower... Gillyflower We do not... ...do not know… Stop this nonsense! - Get out! - Yes, Father. Prisoner? Would you give me my ball back? Thank you, prisoner. Would you give me my ball back? Thank you, prisoner. Prisoner? Why, every time... ...do you expect me to ask to give me my ball back? So as to hear your voice. It's like music that gives me life. And it reminds me of another piece of music... ...the voice of my little daughter... ...who I miss more than anything in the world. What's she like? She's as beautiful as the dawn. And sweet... As sweet as an angel. I want to play with her. Oh, delight… Oh, despair… What are you doing there? Get down! Get out! Yes father. Prisoner, would you give me back my ball? Thank you, prisoner. What games does your daughter play? Hopscotch. Skipping rope, I think. She loves to walk in the woods with her friends. - She has friends? - She has many. She’s so sweet, everyone loves her. She sings all day too. What does she sing? Alas, everything is fading away. Gilly... flower… Gillyflower… We don’t even know each other Gillyflower… Gillyflower… But we already love each other This book is not for you! Get off my throne! And get out of my room! Yes, Father. Thank you, prisoner. Child, don’t throw the ball down to me again. Throw me... the keys. The door wide open! The prisoner is gone! By the devil, jailer... ...you will pay for this betrayal with your life! It wasn't me! The keys were at the head of my bed and disappeared! You were in charge. You will die. Executioner! Take him and hang him right now! It wasn't me! No! Please! No, please! Father, it wasn't him who gave the keys. Who, then? Me. What? You? The man had to find his little daughter. What nonsense is this? Betrayed by my own son! The crime is even greater! You’re going to die! Lord, I shall need a thin rope for such a light body. Manant, that runt is a noble. He will die by the sword. But his blood as a traitor will not defile my castle. Gamekeepers... Take him to the bottom of the woods. Take his life. And let his body serve as food for the wild animals! Are you going to kill me? He was a man... ...but he was nice. And he needed his little girl. And the little girl needed him. Please... don’t kill me. I won't kill you... you poor heroic little boy. You are right. I won’t do this. Go into the forest. And hide well, and stay there! If you're found alive... ...your father would hang us. You must defend yourself alone, against hunger, cold and beasts. Here, take my bow and arrows. Here, take my knife. Take my haversack. There’s a bread, a cheese... ...and a canteen, with water mixed with wine. Take my sheepskin jacket. It will be cold tonight. Goodbye, kid. Heaven protect you! Thank you. Gillyflower… Gillyflower… We don't even know each other... Gillyflower… But we already love each other -But we already love each other Sir Provost! Provost, what does this appearance mean? Lord... ...it means that I met Beau Sauvage. That ridiculous name again! He's certainly a savage... Living in the trees of the forest, and only letting himself be glimpsed through the foliage. And handsome, I saw him... ...alas, up close. He looks like the golden angel of your chapel. You are blasphemous! But, disbelievers... ...you were not to go through the forest... ...especially carrying money! I'm quite aware of that! So I made the detour. But now Beau Sauvage is also rampant outside the forest. No one is safe, wherever there’s a tree. I’ll have them all cut down! I was returning from your mountain villages. The increased rents are giving a tidy sum of money. I was accompanied by my giant bodyguard... ...who helps so well in making the unwilling peasants pay. We passed under a great oak... ...when Beau Sauvage dropped onto my guard and took him down. I then whipped my mule to a trot, and saved myself... ...letting the two men fight to their heart’s content. Having ridden a long way, I thought I was out of danger. But imagine! Beau Sauvage had reached my trotting mule and I... ...passed us without effort... ...has stopped my ass and taken me down... and stripped me of everything! The money bag... ...and my clothes.. They were new clothes! And also, my mule. Such a good mule! I had to walk home all this way! Me... on foot! I'm exhausted. Get up! Get dressed, and return to those villages... ...with my guard... ...and make the peasants cough up what Beau Sauvage took. Besides, they say this monster gives the money to the poor. Let’s get back what's ours. Those monks are late with their chest. The abbey’s treasure is no small thing... ...and must be very heavy. Those monks are all weaklings. Sires, the monks of the abbey of Saint-Alyre! Here are some gold objects... ...given to you by the Reverend Father Abbot... ...as thanks for your generous protection. Good, good. We pray to you, Lord. to forgive our delay. The sun was burning... ...and the chest was heavy. Sure. Come on. Thank God... ...some beggar-monks helped us. That’s good. Open it! These holy men had besides an excellent wine... ...they shared as good Christians. Very good. The key? Here it is. It is unique. I will confess... ...that we have ourselves have had a little nap... ...to recover under the shade of a noble oak… Just open that chest! Behold, behold, Lord! Oh! I don’t understand. Yet it is the right key… Provost Marshal, you’re used to chests... Do something about it! Executioner, turn this key and get it over with! Well go and get my locksmith! What is this mystery? I opened that chest a hundred times! Here I am, Sire. Open this chest. Ah, monk, are you sure that this is your chest? Sir, I am a canon. How am I sure that this is my chest? I've known this old chest since I became a monk! This chest is new. But heaven forgive me... This chest is getting younger! What is this wonder? And the lock is fake. The safe is unlocked. My goodness! Pebbles! Pebbles! But… I myself put the gold objects in the trunk. Is this a sign from heaven? Pebbles! Nothing but pebbles! There is also a sprig of gentian. The signature of Beau Sauvage The Provost Marshal is slow returning from the lower villages. He’s going to be bringing much more than usual! My elite guard, who accompanies that idiot, does wonders. Not only can my men get the rabble to cough up... ...they'll also stop Beau Sauvage from disrespecting my provost marshal. The Provost Marshal! But surely… one man couldn’t get you in this state! Indeed, the Beautiful Savage was not alone. Who was he with? With the peasants, and they were armed. And I think I saw your own gamekeeper. Is that wretched gamekeeper hanged yet? We’re almost there. Executioner and condemned are on the platform. A monk is climbing the ladder. I can’t see what’s going on. Beau Sauvage is coming down, loaded! He prevented the hanging? - Not quite. - What do you mean, not quite? There is a hanged man. at the end of the rope... ...but it’s the executioner. The executioner, that's mad! This is terrible! Such a good executioner! Do we have a replacement? There's no one. Yet with the salary that I'm offering… It’s just this job is very particular. And people don’t want to go crazy. The fools! Oh! Men are laying down firewood around the gallows. - Are you planning a burning? - No. But the idea is good. We’ll burn Beau Sauvage alive. There's a horseman coming, carrying a flaming torch. It’s the Beau Sauvage! The horse jumps. the rider throws his torch... The wood is burning! What a blaze! What a blaze! Lord, the gibbet burns! Lord, the gallows is tumbling over! And it comes down onto your court! The roof is shattered... ...and fire is taking hold. That all my soldiers, all my guards, all my valets.. Encircle the territory of this savage... ...and kill him! Sire, you know the duke’s troops are advancing dangerously. Don't be left defenseless. Are you questioning my orders? Obey! Lord, you'll never again see those sent to capture the Beau Sauvage. He killed them all? No, he spoke to them. What's all that commotion? Your enemy is coming with his army. Flee... You have no protection. Everyone has left the castle. And I’m leaving too. Flee... they’re coming up. Flee? Yokel! Who do you think I am? - Farewell, Lord. - What?! You’re still here? Despicable creature, the dungeon where you held me will be your tomb. But it’s not for me that I make you pay... It’s the murder of your noble child. I loved him like a son... ...and his loss still torments me. You are going to die slowly... because no one will feed you. Only one could have defended you... ...but you killed him. He was not killed. I’m that man’s son. I’m the kid with the ball... ...the child with the key. This man will be neither imprisoned nor killed. How can you save such a murderer? By not being a murderer. I'll stop that curse. Father, everything has collapsed around you. There is nothing left. But you are alive. You’re going to rebuild. I’ll bring you the stones. Noble Savage... ...dispel a mystery. How come my troops have been able to advance in the country as easily, and the castle is deserted? The castle soldiers have joined me. The servants saw that my father had no power. For your progress in the country, where people love me... ...I had given instructions. Why? I knew only your voice, and, later, your reputation. I wanted to meet you. I also wanted to hear from you about your daughter. - You have not forgotten… - No. My daughter grew up beautiful and kind. And she’s in love... ...with two boys she's never met. One is the child who freed me... the other is the hero we call… Beau Sauvage. And when she sees you in person, she’ll love you thrice over. And... when will she see me? Now. She's accompanied me everywhere. Her guards are waiting for the sign that she can proceed safely. I’m on a little cloud. I'd guessed who Beau Sauvage was! I don’t. I’m an idiot. Oh no... You let the story carry you. We move forward in time... the eighteenth century. - Why? - I like the 18th century. I’ll tell you a fantasy of yesteryear... ...in the amazing Turkish costumes of the time. The beginning comes from a Moroccan tale. What title? -My title is… The Princess of Roses and the Prince of doughnuts. Let him go. He’s quick, he’ll melt into the market crowd. He's finished. We’ll catch him later. Butchers now have the power. I will never rule my country. But I got the chance to escape the killers. I’m going to go far... Far away. Farewell, my palace. Farewell, my city. Farewell, my country. But hello to a changing life that continues. What a city! So ironic… I almost married the local princess. The Princess of Roses. What a beautiful portrait I was sent… I’ve never been that close to her... ...but our worlds have never been so far apart. I no longer exist. I’m just a nobody, looking for work. Another assistant gone! If you were more lenient, your assistants would stay. I'll speak to them as I wish! And if you were pleasant, your customers would come back! How are my doughnuts? Wait until I have an assistant! Here he is, he’s found! Can you cook? No, but I can learn. - Young people! All ignorant. - Take him. He’s a good-looking boy... He'll attract customers... Which is not your strong suit. Princess of the Roses… That’s a nice name. A little corny, maybe. No big deal. Your doughnuts are too small, you idiot! Some customers will like them, I think. We don’t think here. we follow the recipe! Princess of the Roses… His portrait had made me dream, at the time. "What’s that twist? You idiot!" I invented a shape. We don’t invent here. we follow the recipe! Princess of the Roses. But one portrait is really not enough. Did you add an ingredient? Yes, a pinch of cinnamon, to innovate. We don't innovate here... we follow the recipe! Give me a taste. A perfect balance. I want a dozen. Right away, my dear lady! What a foolish custom, to marry without knowing the other. And that Princess of the Roses, I would have known her well… Make way! Make way for the Grand Vizier! One doughnut, please. Well, bring a doughnut to His Excellency, the Grand Vizier! Cinnamon… Her Highness, the Princess of the Roses... ...wants to eat market doughnuts. These doughnuts will do. You will deliver 30 to the palace... ...within the hour. Make way for the Grand Vizier! I’m going to see the princess! You idiot! A princess can’t be seen. - Let alone for a street seller! - They say she is very beautiful. They say anything! Some have seen a portrait. Her father sends them to all the princes. You need a good painter, not a good model! Latest weapon from Damascus, the damascene. Iznik ceramics! Variegated. Ripe watermelons... Red, like a girl with beauty spots. Fresh, fresh! Arabian dates, honey! Succulent Armenian kebabs... Bulgarian yogurt! So sweet! Enjoy these Jewish dumplings! Currants, so sweet! Less than those of Smyrna! Turkish delight... jewels that melt in the mouth! Spices from everywhere, make your cuisine even better. Honey from Romania! Come and see the new doughnut seller from the market. How cute! And so curly! Who is your hairdresser, nice doughnut merchant? -Uh… the wind. And where are you from? From where wind comes. -Your first name? The son of the wind! - He answers pretty well. - But he creates mysteries! You’ll see... he’ll say that he's a prince! Ah, that! I promise I won't tell you that. Fluffy… Light… Scented… Stop! There won't be any left for the princess! The princess has good qualities... But patience isn't one of them. Goodbye, handsome doughnut seller! -Your doughnuts will go to the princess. She'll love them. - You’ll be back tomorrow. - With 50 doughnuts. At least! He’s the new doughnut seller. A marvel! The most handsome boy in town! A handsome boy? I want to see him! Tomorrow, bring him into the room where I examine the princes. I’m going to the Princess of the Roses! I work for the Princess of the Roses! I feed the Princess of the Roses! It’s funny, you know, but it doesn’t help me. Come on! Faster than that, lazy! The princess hates to wait! Handsome doughnut seller, here you are at last! We were worried. Perhaps you had fallen into your fryer?! I'm very careful. I wanted to see you beautiful ladies again. - I added doughnuts for you. - Oh, how kind! Follow us, generous doughnut seller... ...for a little secret visit. Thank you for showing me these splendours. You are here for the princess to see you. Shall I see her? Don't be absurd! It’s a one-way view. Where does the princess hide? It’s a secret. You’ll never know. Handsome seller of doughnuts... ...would you like to spend a few moments with me? A few moments… And all my life, if you wish. So… find a way to come to my chambers... ...or get me out. Help me, beautiful ladies, you who know more than me! What we know, is that you’ll never get in, into the princess’s chambers. If, by a miracle, you could do it, you would be quickly spotted… ...and strangled. So would we. As for getting the princess out, it’s also impossible. If, by a miracle, you could do it... ...she would be hunted, found, and strangled. You too, of course. -Now that I’ve seen her and heard… ...I’m in love forever! I’m not happy delivering doughnuts anymore. Impossible to meet in the palace. Impossible to meet outside the palace. Is there a gap between the two? I’m going to strike a blow! What blow, cute doughnut salesman? - I’m starting my own business. - Good news! Consider that you already have a loyal customer! Are you coming now? Lout! Good for nothing! Another delay like that and you're fired! Thank you for teaching me how to make doughnuts. I have to go now. I wish you well. Well, you had it coming! Attention, ladies! This big doughnut with a rose bud is for the princess! Oh, how pretty! How lovely! - What is it? - Nothing… A lump. - A lump? - That handsome man is slipping! No, no! The doughnut is delicious. But suddenly I’m not hungry. And I have a terrible need to sleep. You can give me a moment. Beautiful princess... I just set up my own business. Near the rear wall of the palace, I bought a little house. You will find it thanks to the two pine trees on the patio. If you can approach the wall... ...throw me a rock, wrapped with your answer. I've started digging a tunnel to you. My handsome doughnut seller, what good news! I can sneak into the wall... ...which is built on an ancient buried palace... ...that is said to be haunted. This is perfect! No nuisance dares go that way. I have discovered a nice old room, under the wall. Dig in to the right. Don’t go to the left. It’s the death-row cell. I eagerly await your doughnut tomorrow. Oh yes, I’m digging. I’m digging all night! And all day long, I shudder, I’m going for doughnuts. And customers are coming… It’s an exciting life. I’m on the wall. Is there a way to get in through these stones? I also work all night to fix our secret living room. Yes, there is a way. A corner of the pavement is broken and you can open that way. When the moon rises, I’ll start banging with my trowel. You head towards the sound. Do you hear? It’s coming from under the wall. The old palace! The old haunted palace… Full of evil genies! Let’s move away… and quickly! Welcome, handsome doughnut seller. Good evening, beautiful princess. What do you think of our little home? It's like mine. How? Does it look like a doughnut stall? No, like a palace! In fact, at the bottom of it all... ...I am a prince. A prince? What a disappointment! But you're a princess! I know all too well. My servants are freer than me. But I’m sick and tired of princes! They come every day. My father sends my portrait to anyone. I know… A doughnut seller was to be so much more fascinating! But I’m a doughnut seller! And I make them myself! Yes... And so well… - You smell good… - Ah yes? You smell like frying. It’s delicious… And you smell of roses... More precisely, rose jam. It’s my big specialty. Sit down, I’ll serve you the one I just made. I made pistachio doughnuts. Exactly what we needed. Something's not right. What? You seem impoverished. ...a poor doughnut seller, yet you buy a house with patio, ...and all kitchen equipment, and oil, flour, sugar… Easy! I sold a button from my jacket. Don’t tell me anything! When I escaped the killers, I only had my jacket. But it was a prince’s jacket... ...with diamond buttons. I understand! I like when stories make sense. Like 'The Black Diamond'. Do you know it? No! Tell me! Very well... Once upon a time... ...at the top of the mountain of Chrysoprase... ...in the black eagle’s nest... ...lived an ivory princess. So the Jet Prince and the Ivory Princess... ...could finally get married, be happy... ...and have many children. -What a tale… What a storyteller! What time do you think it is? Oh my God, it's past midnight! It's 5 in the morning... The sun will soon rise! I didn’t see time pass! Goodbye! I’m going o prepare my doughnuts! I’ll be eagerly waiting for mine! He writes nice things… What she writes is lovely. Good evening, beautiful princess. Good evening, handsome doughnut seller. Tonight, zucchini doughnuts. And jam of Damascus roses, my favorite. -I sold a second button! Can you play it? - Do you hear the genies? - Ah yes. - Well… it’s prettier than yesterday. - Perhaps, but I don't trust it. - Let’s hurry up. - It’s safer. But… I would have stayed a while. Tell me, Vizier... Isn’t there music around here? Indeed, Lord Sultan... Your Highness has sharp hearing. It’s very nice. Let’s get closer. It seems to come from the city. Certainly, Lord Sultan. Nothing escapes the sagacity of Your Highness. Lord, it’s not from the city! It comes from the old palace that's buried and cursed! Stay away from it! Surely, Vizier... you don’t believe that nonsense? This is not nonsense! We’ve believed in it for a long time. What an argument! We don’t know what evil is taking place beneath us! Devils? They’re more like angels. This music is heavenly. How well it goes with the moonlight… But where are these musical angels? Lord, not this way! Come on, come on, Vizier. But what is this staircase.. ...that flowering bushes hide from view? Lord, do not go down! Let’s go, Vizier. Let’s see what’s going on under our palace. Guards! Come protect the Grand Vizier! He's afraid! Vizier… - My daughter! - The doughnut seller! My daughter, dishonoured by a man, doughnut seller! Guards! Seize these criminals. Throw them in the dungeon. It’s convenient, it’s next door! Triple-lock them in, and stay outside the door! It’s their last moment together. They'll only come out... ...to be whipped in the public square... ...then beheaded! Our life was very short. And our happiness, even shorter. We shall live long... ...be happy and have many children… Stop! The tales are over. Tomorrow, when the executioners will come for us... ...they’ll find the dungeon empty. Is the misfortune that makes you lose your mind? Abduction by genies. Are you delirious? No, actually, it’s my magic ladle that will liberate us. You have gone mad. My best ladle is nearby. A ladle? I’m going crazy, too! When you told me to avoid the dungeon on the left, I went there. You never know… It was hard, but I was able to recognize the place. I left my ladle as leverage… Go ahead! I’ll put the slab down, then, so that people... ...are astounded by our disappearance. The genies did it all. - I would have liked to visit your house. - No time. Hurry! Quickly... For your jewelry. - Do you have doughnuts? - You think of everything! And dates and dried figs, juicy mandarins and Turkish delight. - Don't forget the canteen! - Especially not. Put these old slippers on to protect you. And you cover yourself with my jacket, that protected me from the sun. -What about you? The basket will shelter me. - We’ll take the night caravan. - A caravan at night? That makes it possible to make way before the burning sun. And where does this caravan go? I have no idea. How wonderful! The important thing is to go with you. We shall discover the world. Ever since I met you, I’m not bored anymore! Bandits! Get off your camels. You will not be harmed, if you obey. Here, here… A female I like. You’re going to be my submissive slave. Bandits! One false move... ...and I kill your leader! Drop your weapons and get off your mounts! Obey him! And you, tie them! Unbelievable! The caravan is saved! The poor boy and poor girl are heroes! Thank you, rescuers! Long live the prince and the princess! Prince and princess? Are you kidding us? No! You are the prince and princess of the caravan! We’ll get you dressed like never before! And carry you! We had wanted to go unnoticed. That was a failure! I was a little impulsive. You know, I’m not used to the way they talk to me. Never get used to it. You did a great job! You too. Without your voice and his sword, I didn’t stand a chance. And here you are again, brighter than ever. And you are not bad, dressed up like a prince. I'm not dressed up! Yes… I’m in a costume. I was happy, as a seller... ...coming and going as I liked, in the city and with the people... ...and creating my business. And before you... And the way that you loved me. -I am also in disguise. For the first time in my life, I find myself without a jewel... ...out of the palace, incredibly light... ...free, and being myself. And I did it... ...with you. And here I am again, loaded with those ornaments I forgot. I already hear people saying... You can’t escape your destiny. No. Not long ago, my fate as a prince was to get me slaughtered. The invaders were the strongest. But I was the nimblest and I slipped through their fingers. Then my fate as a doughnut seller... ...meant I could never claim a princess. You said to find a way. I’ve found it. My destiny as a princess was to be married to anyone who… ...was my father's choice. But now I’m far away, with the boy I love. Our destiny... ...is luck and our decisions. These turbans clash with the decision... ...to get closer. For now, we decide... ...to be happy in this comfortable palanquin... ...with its soft cushions and its shiny baubles. Yes. We are fine. The journey is delightful... ...heading for life… Subtitles by FatPlank
