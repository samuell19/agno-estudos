The First World War, somewhere on the war front ACE OF ACES Kill the kraut. Take him down. Try again. Take the bloody Frenchie down. Try from the side. For three years, I've been stuck in the mud and the cold with this regiment. And that's hard, private Hitler. Very, very hard, lieutenant Rosenblum. But enduring you, private Hitler... is a lot harder! Rosenblum. Asshole. Look, Adolf. Captain Kavalier, with a K for kaputt? No, with a C for clown. Better paint the French flag on my Fokker. My 30th victory on your Fokker? -I beat you. You didn't beat me. There's nothing wrong with my bird. I just landed her a bit roughly. But the engine... is still in perfect condition. Just like me. But you have no more wings and you have a broken arm. You're a veteran now... whose wheelchair will soon be pushed by a pretty French woman. And who will have to escape from the camp I'll take him to? Sense of humour? -Hurry. Just give up. I'm a boxer. Do you refuse to fight? -Like this then. Go ahead. Wait. Bunch of idiots. Thanks. Some assholes. 20 years later August 1936 Now with your left. Stay away from the ropes. Uppercut. Impressive. With your left now. You're almost there. He's almost had it. I'm sorry. -Idiot. RESERVED Look at her bum. Why are you laughing? -Because I know you'll win. You've got him in your pocket. Think of the Olympics. Third round. The winner: Michelot. How much? -At least 120. Good. Come here. -That negro wasn't bad. Certainly not. Especially in the ropes. He was almost in the audience. He braced himself and hop... I'm so sorry. And you didn't even do it on purpose. -Yes, I mean no... I'm proposing a toast to all the foreign sports people... who refuse to go to Berlin. To the brave sports people who will not be parading... for Chancellor Hitler and who will not be making the Nazi salute. I didn't hear that well. Did you say something? Me? No, I didn't say anything. It's not the Nazi salute, it's the Olympic salute. Let the women talk. We'll get France some medals. My boxers and I won't be parading for Hitler anyway. Shut up, Jo. Don't mix sports and politics. And what does Hitler do? Our Olympic Committee should have refused... to participate in games in a fascist country. Everybody's participating. There are even Jews in the German team. Two in 427 and no boxers. -So you want us to beat up Jews? Enough about the Games. Congratulations, Roger. Pierre, G.B. speaking. -I have news. Your interview with Hitler's on. You'll be leaving for Berlin. Great. -How did it go tonight? Do you have room left on the front page? He totally took the bait. I'm listening: -Headline: Scandal at Olympics. Get ready for the picture. Don't move and smile. Thanks. Sir, can I get an autograph? -What's your name? My buddy Simon wants an autograph. Go ahead. How old are you? -Ten. Did you see this? Jo Cavalier, famous coach, speaks out. Do French sports people refuse to parade for Hitler? You shouldn't talk to the press. They'll be throwing tomatoes at me in Berlin. I don't know that journalist. -He's well informed. Get lost or you'll get more than a tomato from me. Alright then. Do you know who G.B. is? -No. If I get my hands on that guy... It's badly written and all made up. Don't read that. A drink? -No, thank you. Are you going to Berlin for the Games? -No. For a man? Are you going to see a man? -Yes. Is he handsome? -Not bad looking. Strong? -Not exactly. He's impressive, a go-getter, aggressive. But not strong. French or German? -Is this an interrogation? German. So he's blond. -Dark hair and a moustache. Oh no, not him. That'll teach me asking questions. -He's absolutely not my type. What is your type? -I like clumsy men. Big, strong men with light coloured eyes... full lips and a nose that's... -Broken? Braggers with lots of complexes. -I have no complexes. A superiority complex. What's your type of woman? What do you want? -I wanted your autograph. Not now. Later. Tonight in Berlin, shall we go to brasserie Resy or Roof Garden? Or to Ciro, near the lake? In the train, I read bad papers and talk to strangers. But after I arrive, I'm very selective about the people I have dinner with... and the people I sleep with. Goodnight. Alvarez, the Catalan featherweight, has joined the Republicans. There's Jo. The cigarettes! I said no smoking! Close the window. What do you want now? -Did you know Von Richthofen? Yes, but not personally. Why? -And Von Beckmann? Von Beckmann's a friend. Give me that pen. Passports. That's my bird. Where did you get it? -From the bars. And your picture too. You're covered with wrinkles. Sign there. Are you French? -German. I have French relatives. I spend summers there. Can you get me a ticket for the Olympics? Nungesser, Fonck... And Navarre. He didn't end well. Jewish? -Yes. Attention, please. The Olympic train from Paris is entering the station. Stay away from the rails. Sports people straight into the bus. It looks like the army here. Rochetin, weightlifter. Michelot, boxer. Hurry. I'll see you in the hotel. I'll take you to the hotel. -No, I'll be picked up. But he... seems to have been forgotten. -I have to stay with my boxers. Weren't you prepared to give me a lift? Miss Belcourt? -That's my car. I'm going. Thanks for helping him. Where are your parents? -Dead. When? -When I was two. Hasn't anyone been looking after you? I live with my grandpa and grandma. 5 Wissemburgstrasse. But they're not here. -Wait a bit more. Because I... Do they live far away? -Too far to walk. Come with me. It's there. That lit shop is my grandfather's bookshop. There's a crowd in there. I'm afraid. That's the police. How much is it? -2.40, please. You stay here. Don't move. How much is The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann? Verboten! Banned in Germany is that book! Has Zola been banned too? -Yes, also banned. Brecht? -Banned. Hemingway? Freud? Hitler? No, that's Mein Kampf. Jewish you are? Jewish you look. Your grammar's wrong. You should say: You look Jewish. Like if I said: Stupid you look. It's true, but not correct. Commissioner, I haven't found anything. Call them and tell them. Your papers can I have, sir? Drop dead you can, Herr Kommissar. Arrest him. Hurry, Simon. Block all exits! Arrest him! After him! This Olympic torch that was lit by the sun... came from Athens, via Belgrade and Vienna to Berlin. Here. Run, man! Georges Cavalier, from the French boxing team. From Munich, we'll take you to the Berghof. I'm very happy that Hitler will receive me. Can I take pictures? First Dr. Goebbels, our Minister of Propaganda, wants to talk to you. He looks after everything. He'll give you a list of allowed questions. Fine. When do I meet him? -Now. He's waiting for you in his private suite in the Ciro hotel. A private suite? There you can talk to him in peace. -I already have a dinner date. With this gentleman. I was afraid you'd forgotten our dinner date. Mr Cavalier, our boxing trainer. Mister Hammel and mister Steiner. Why aren't you ready yet? It's an old French tradition to lock... French men up in a closet in their underwear. I got dressed for the occasion. Good night, gentlemen. Gabrielle... I really want you. The key to room 212. Here's your bag. How did you get here? They're outside. -Who? My grandfather, grandma Rachel, aunt Sarah... uncle Lazar, Rebecca and uncle Moshe. What are you going to do? -Go home. They must be gone by now. You're insane. I'll talk to your grandpa and grandma. Will you wait? -No. It's late. I'm going to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. Jo Cavalier. Please take my bag to my room. Are you coming? I was Adolf Hitler's superior. I'd like to say to him: Mein F?hrer, remember 1914? Lazar is a psychiatrist. He says Hitler's... cyclothymic. -What? An idiot. What's wrong? -Do you have two beds? Mr and Mrs Rosenblum? It's a bit tight,, but... -And what about me? You go with Emile. Make room. -One moment. Yeah, right. -Goodnight, children. Who is it? -Jo. Open up. What do you want? -Come out. Thanks. -Sleep well. Are you crazy? -I'll explain. It's very important to the Rosenblum family. What do I care about them? -This is their son. Hello, swimmers. We don't have enough room. It's a matter of life or death. Miss Belcourt? Gaby? Could you look after an orphan for one night? Of course. -Good, you can sleep with Michelot. Paris for you, the Paris-Midi paper. Hello, Gaby? G.B? Are you there? Darling? Pierre, I'll call you back. Yes, I'm a journalist. I wrote that. But I didn't make anything up. They're your own words. They were meant for my friends. -It's my job to listen. Bravo. You're a champion at conning people. If that was an Olympic sport, you'd already have the gold medal. Better go to your own room. I swore I'd get that asshole. I thought it was a man. I knew what he looked like: fat, sneaky, beady little eyes. I was going to make him eat his own newspaper. I regret that the most: that I can't do that. Herr Cavalier, please. You watch too many American movies. -I'm going to my daughter in Brooklyn. Moshe, take off in the car. I can't leave my shop behind. -There is no more shop. We could be disqualified. Kicked out of Germany. Cavalier. Have you got the car? -It's parked in front. Hold this. Herr Cavalier, a few questions about last night I have. Last night? Did anything happen? You can't talk like that to Mr Kavalier. I don't care if he's your friend, General. This man beat me up. And my colleagues! And an entire bookshop! In Germany, General Von Beckmann we don't only have. Gestapo we also have. Come, Otto. One big asshole, not you think, General? You don't know them. They're dangerous. Even for you and me. They can't hurt you. Go play with a hoop, kid. You're a walking advertisement for the Arian race. And you're a war hero, Herr General. No one's invulnerable these days. Two coffee, please. What's really going on here, G?nther? I'm unhappy, Jo. They're watching everybody. Even artists. When a country starts doing that, it's a terrible sign. Come live in Paris. -I'm a German. I don't want to leave. Kick that dangerous fool out. I hate that man. He makes me... What's the word? Puke. -But he also does good things. Do you call attacking us good? -That's not so bad. 38 million Germans voted for him. If millions commit the same stupidity, it's still a stupidity. Where's my car? -I lent it to the Rosenblums. Who are they? -Friends of mine. Do you mind? Of course I mind. Because they're Jews. -You French are so preachy. Just like your rooster: stupid and vain. Are eagles that smart? -Are you coming, Jo? One moment. We're not going to fight over a car. The day after tomorrow, it'll be found near the Austrian border. That's all. We'll have helped good people. Are you coming? -No, I'm not coming. Aren't you going to the parade? -Can you see me like this? The parade starts. It's dignified and impressive. The teams of the 50 participating countries are marching into the stadium. The French team gets a big hand. Some say that's due to the raised arm... that the Germans interpret as the Nazi salute. Nonsense, of course. What can we learn from this new Germany... that educates its youth by means of sport. I declare... the games of Berlin, the eleventh modern Olympic Games, open. There go the peace doves... followed by cannon shots, ordered by the F?hrer himself. Immediately, fabulous records are being set. The biggest sensation of the day is caused by American negro Jesse Owens... who participated in the 100 metres. Without trying very hard... he wins his series in 10.3 seconds. With your left now. Left, right. Don't let him push you in the ropes. Left, right. More swing, faster. Good. His left is still too low. -Pay attention to that. Time for a lesson, Raymond. Left, left. Time, Jo. -Maurice, 12 o'clock. I'm going. We'll continue at 4. Where are you taking me? -You'll see. If you had had one of those, I wouldn't have dared take you down. Nonsense, I shot you down. We're still as crazy as 20 years ago. We've stayed young. Beautiful bird. -Hitler hates everything beautiful. Braque, Picasso, Kirchner. Everything I love. He's got the taste of a hick. But in the air I forget everything. -Does she fly? Come on. To get our minds off things. Can I talk to you? -Miss Belcourt, General Von Beckmann. Simon called me. He's looking for you. He's 200 kilometres north of Munich. His family's been arrested. The grandmother asked if the sausages were kosher in a restaurant. Simon had gone to the toilet. He called the hotel right away. He's waiting for you now. -But I don't know that kid. I'm not a nanny. I'm the coach of a boxing team. The finals are tomorrow. Michelot in the heavyweight... and Despeaux in the middleweight. Two chances at gold. I've been dreaming about it for 4 years. Four years of blood, sweat and tears. So I won't go to Munich to pick up a little kid. Damn! -What then? Where is he? -Near Kn?ssen. Have you used a parachute before? -No, but I can try. Nonsense, she might break her legs. And your finals? -I'd better not miss them. Come. Get my cap. Tell me, what was your route? What? -How did you want to go to Austria? Via the mountains near Salzburg. My sister in Vienna would send a car... to a little hotel just across the border. Your sister's waiting there, my team's waiting there. And we're in the middle. You have to go back to Berlin. -And what would I do with you? I'm coming to the Games. -Do you realise you've been very lucky? You called me and here I am, although the finals are on tomorrow. I'm taking you to your sister and then I'll go back to Berlin. Move over. My sister's not nice. What do you think of me? -Why? What kind of man am I? -An adventurer. What's that? -D'Artagnan, Zorro. If an adventurer's always in trouble, I am one. Because if there's a problem somewhere, I'm part of it. But adventurers aren't good fathers. Did you say that because I'm an orphan? I'm explaining, like I would to a man, to a friend, why... I have no children. Come down. French uniforms to Jewish traitors loaned. He means that German police arrested men who stole our uniforms, near Munich. Near Munich Jews with French rooster were arrested. Cavalier where is? He's gone for a moment. -To get matches. Lucien, Jo for you. I'm 200 kilometres north of Munich. I'm helping that kid across the border. Look after the boys. I'll be back tomorrow. Are they alright? Did Raymond get rid of his pain? He has to work on his left uppercut. Tiller's liver is his weak spot. Lucien? 200 kilometres north of Munich. Search the entire area. Your room key. Do you have any luggage? -We're not staying the night. Unfortunately not. Come. They have no more rooms. We'll sleep in the open air. Don't sway. Stay to the right. Go to second gear. You have no talent. -My legs are too short. Enough of this. I'm taking over. Will you teach me to fly too? CAREFUL! I liked to hit opponents, but I didn't like it when they'd hit me. And I loved women and smoking. I ruined my own career. Are you listening? Eat something. -What will they do with them? Interrogate them. And since they're innocent, they'll let them go again. Have you been to America? In 1932, the Games were in Los Angeles. Michelot was going to win for sure. But in the third round... David Katzmann also didn't do anything. -What happened to him? After the Sabbath, his parents used to play music at our place. They sold violins, next door to us. One day, the SA smashed their shop. That caused a lot of noise with all those instruments. The next day, my friend David didn't come to school. We've never seen them again. -Maybe they're travelling. Have you ever slept in silk sheets before? Jo, did you hear that? -What? I heard someone. Why are you laughing? There's no one. Go to sleep. I'll teach you something. When you're afraid, you should laugh hard. Then the others get scared and you're not scared anymore. I really hear someone. Go to sleep. It's late. Simon, wake up. It's time. Let's go. Hurry. Hide in the back, under the parachute. Don't move. General Von Beckmann? -No. Ich bin a friend. I am a Freund... ...of General Von Beckmann's. Are you French? What's that? -A b?hr. Ich bin very nice and sweet. His name's Beethoven. We're looking for a Frenchman with a child, not a bear. What's underneath that? The game's over. Come sit here. Get down. Take over the wheel. Keep driving. Give me the wheel. Faster. -The bloody car doesn't want to. Look, Jo. You promised. -You can't hitchhike with a bear. And now they know what he looks like. We could have kept the car. -They've seen that too. Forget about the car. You're a pain, you know? Listen, Simon. He's better off with his family. -He'll never find them again. No, maybe not. He won't like that at first. It's hard to be free when you're that young. But life in a cage... Because, you know... they would have taken him. Why? Beethoven isn't Jewish. They're going towards Abensberg. Arrest them there. We caught the person who stole your car. A Frenchman with a child. Where are they? -At the police station. And my car? -There too. They've been caught. I'll go there. -I want to come too. I'd better go alone. Miss Belcourt, are you coming? Apologize to the F?hrer for me. I'll be at the staff meeting at 7 sharp. See you later. Hurry, Von Beckmann wants to leave right away. G?nther is here. You're kidding. Where's the F?hrer? I was his lieutenant. Commissioner Fricke will be here soon. Simon! -Grandma! Is that your grandmother? Stay with your family. This way. We didn't know you loaned him your car. But he's a dangerous madman. Can you vouch for him? Completely! He's a very mild-mannered man. I trust him, even though he's French. Hands in the air. My handcuffs. -Give me the keys. I almost had you out, idiot. -Not the Rosenblums. Don't start about them again. Tell them to lie down. Can you get me an airplane? -Idiot, you're not going to Berlin. The General's right. Come with us. Good people are expecting us on the other side of the border. Tonight's the final. No one cares about that, except me. They'll arrest you. -You can't see the stadium from jail. Olympic Games or not, you've gone too far. Jo, come to Austria. What good does that do? I should be with my boys in Berlin. Here it is. Walk straight south. In half an hour, you'll be in Austria. We're very grateful. God bless you, boy. Tell Gaby I'm sorry about the other day. Good luck, Jo. -And also tell her... Never mind I'll do it myself. Good luck, G?nther. And thanks. We lost them. -No, there they are! Come. Quickly, go. Austria's that way. Walk. To the left. They want to cross the border. Drive, man! Drive! The F?hrer's expecting you, General. We're here. Here it is. The Austrian border. Look at this barbed wire. Behind it is freedom. All I want is peace in Europe and in the world. War isn't the solution for anybody. Me? Territorial expansion? So you're not looking at Austria? This is my only view of Austria. But I have an objective. Germany has to wipe out Poland. Germany has to massacre the French. At the Olympic Games, of course. I want Germany to win all the medals. Welcome to the Berghof. We've met. May I? Is there no child here? I love dogs and children. Adolf, it's getting dark. My sister Angela. Nice to meet you. Eva Braun will be here tomorrow morning. Miss Braun! -Yes, miss Braun! Get everything inside! Madam, General. -Thank you. Well? They're in Austria now. When that Braun woman comes back, I'll be gone. No blackmail. That doesn't work on me. I'd do anything for you. You should be a bit more considerate. What would you say if I brought a man here? You're only right is to live her and shut up. There's your hotel. One moment. Dieter? Get the car ready. I'm leaving tonight. I have six people here. Musicians. They say they're expected at the Berghof. We were wondering where they were. They're performing for the F?hrer tonight. There they are. What a journey! Do you speak French, madam? Have you got a radio here? We'll never forget this house. We're Germans first of all. Enough. Do you have a radio? What's a Frenchman doing in your group. -Two Frenchmen are in the boxing finals. You do have a radio, don't you? -Yes, in my brother's room. Your brother's room? Let's go there, cutie. Thanks to him, we made it. Give our friends dry clothes. You tapped me on the cheek. I thought no man would ever do that again. Shall we go? -Upstairs. Nice place. Is the style Tyrolean? Austrian. My brother was born in Austria, not in Bavaria. In the town of Braunau. For us, Austria is the same as Germany. -My brother says that too: Anschluss. Do you believe in the stars? I spoke to my brother's astrologer. -He has an astrologer? He said I'll soon meet someone. He didn't mention French. A very attractive man of around 40. I think what you and your brother are doing's very brave. All Germans are behind us. -Not all of them. It's here. This is his study. I'll tell Adolf you're here. See you in a bit. Michelot forces Vogt into the ropes. The German goes down. No, he doesn't. Keep going, Michelot. Left, right. And in ring B, Jean Despeaux is boxing against Norwegian Tiller. Last round. Despeaux is beating into the Norwegian, who's looking for a knock-out. Will France take two gold medals home? You're about to hear the result. Michelot and Despeaux have both won. Excuse me. Don't mind me. The asshole. What are you doing here? Nothing. -Who are you? Come with me. Here's a sandwich. Hide. We'll undress him. Are you sure this is Austria? -It's G?nther's fault. Give me. G?nther's about 40, attractive and not French. Ich lieber dich means 'I love you', right? Ich liebe dich. Why? -Run to that car. G?nther's business cards are in the glove compartment. Get them. You know what? You're an adventurer too. I'll make sure all those useless little states disappear from the map. We have to act fast. We have to make sure the German race... has sufficient living space. The only question is: When and how? And at which price? The Rosenblum family? -What? Not again. You sent them in the wrong direction. You get them out of here. Three little onions, raisins soaked in vodka... Ladies and gentlemen, the F?hrer! I greet you. Adolg! -No, dad. What's wrong with her? Overwhelmed by emotion. She's seen the F?hrer! Music, please! Come with me, dear friends. Why music? We are all happy to greet our beloved F?hrer. Music, please! General Von Beckmann? "I love you." "Let's go away together tonight." I don't know you and I don't know the Rosenblums either. I'm leaving with the Rosenblums in Hitler's car. Great idea! -You bring his sister in your car. Which sister? -Adolf's sister. She's crazy about you. She's beautiful. Only slightly less beautiful than Gaby. Why do you say that? I'm coming. We'd better speak French. Why did you wait so long? Because of Adolf, I guess. He doesn't accept any man near me. When I found this under my door, my heart skipped a beat. I love you. -I love you too. I'm so happy. -Do you have a car, Angela? Adolf's Mercedes. Let's take my car instead. Why? -I'm already taking his sister. I can't also take his car. Beautiful music. What is it? Come with me. Quick, hurry. Get in. -That's Hitler's car. That's why. Get in. The Merry Widow. Hitler's favourite music. Get in quickly. That's my car driving off! Who's driving off with my car? -Your sister. She's leaving the Berghof with a suitcase. I told her not to leave the Berghof! Take it off, kid. You wear it, Mr Rosenblum. The rest get down. The F?hrer! Attention... present arms! The F?hrer! Attention... present arms! Angela, stop! Adolf, it's me. Don't you recognize me? Lieutenant Rosenblum! Yes, it's me. Stop that car! That's an order! Rosenblum, you asshole. The Austrian border. Shall we? Hit it. Do it again! -Hold tight! Hitler's invading Austria! Look. Beethoven!
