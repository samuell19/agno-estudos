Hello, Nicholas. Hello, Rex, how are you? Fine, fine. Where is Simon? Well, when did you last see him? Three months ago. Three months? Well, do you think he's in trouble? Wouldn't he have told me if he was? Well, perhaps he told Richard or Marie. No, they haven't seen him since Christmas. Then something must be wrong. Let's go to his club. He isn't there anymore, Rex. He bought a house, a large one. What on Earth for? Exactly. Well, do you know where it is? Mr. Simon Aron's house. Mr. Aron? Good Lord. Nicholas. Simon. Rex. Hello, Simon. What a wonderful surprise. We must apologize for breaking in on your party like this, Simon. Oh, it isn't a party. It's just a meeting of a little astronomical society I've joined. Really? Well, let me introduce you to the members. Countess, may I introduce my friends? The Duc de Richleau. Madame. Enchantee. And Rex Van Ryn. Countess d'Urfe. Madame. Monsieur. Tanith, Mr. Mocata, I'd like to introduce you to my friends. The Duc de Richleau, Mr. Van Ryn. Ms. Carlisle, Mr. Mocata. It's always a pleasure to meet Simon's friends. Mademoiselle. Monsieur. Mr. Van Ryn. I believe we have met before. Have we? I don't remember. So you've joined an astronomical society, have you, Simon? We were pleased to welcome him to our circle. Yes. That explains why I haven't seen anything of you for these last few months and why you appear to have forgotten our reunion tonight. Well, I was-- Would you excuse me for a moment, gentlemen? There's something I must say to Simon. You're friends of Simon's? Yes, indeed, mademoiselle. His father, Rex, and I were companions in the Escadrille Lafayette. And when he died you vowed to keep an eye on Simon? Yes. Well, when did you join this group? We were never told that... I don't understand. Surely we're not meant to be more than 13. Oh, we're not members. What? We only stopped by to see Simon. I've just come back from the continent. You see, we have this-- Excuse me. What's going on now? We're going to be asked to leave, Rex. You move among the guests and listen to what they have to say. Rex, old friend. I hate to say it, but I'm gonna have to throw you out. The meeting's due to start very shortly. It's better than new, but we must learn to control it. Control? Yes, yes, I see exactly what you mean. An organization... Do you think we shall have a good meeting tonight? If the weather improves, we shall learn much. It is his natal conjunction which should help immeasurably. Two years ago in Berlin, I experienced exactly similar conditions. That is most interesting. It is all a question of strong ties. Mars, in conjunction with Saturn, of course. Yes, sir, but you mustn't call him Abraham until deep pull is executed. Now why is that? Well, there's got to be an initiation ceremony first, then we can call him. Oh. This looks like a splendid wine, Simon. And you always had excellent taste. Nicholas, I feel dreadfully embarrassed. I'd love to have you stay but, well, it's not an ordinary meeting, you see. And, well, you and Rex not being members. Oh, don't you worry about that, my dear chap. It's perfectly all right. We both understand perfectly, don't we, Rex? Of course. I feel terrible about missing our reunion tonight. It's a special meeting. We must get together very soon, perhaps tomorrow? Oh, Simon, I see you've got an observatory here. I'm very interested in astronomy, and I'd like to have a look through your telescope, if I may. I'll only be five minutes. What do you want to look at his blasted telescope for? I don't. Simon, those charts. They're not astronomical, are they? No, good Lord, no. They're just for decoration. Relics, Middle Ages nonsense, you know. It's clever of you to extend the decorative scheme to the floor. Yes. Well, if you'd like to see the-- Sounds like mice. You'll have to go now. What in the name of? You fool! I'd rather see you dead than meddling with black magic. Let go of me. I didn't ask you to come here tonight. Even my oldest friends have no right to butt in on my private affairs. Will someone please say-- I'm sorry, Simon, but I feel like a father who sees his child trying to pick live coals out of a fire. Will someone kindly tell me what's going on? Chickens in a basket, diagrams on a floor. Do these mean something to you? It means that Simon here is playing the most dangerous game known to mankind. Oh, come on, Nicholas. Rex is right, you're making too much of it. Then you have no objection if we stay? You aren't members of the circle. Circle? The society. If we stay, there'd be more than 13, wouldn't there? Look, Simon, I think you will admit that whilst Rex and I have been your closest friends for more than 10 years now, we have never at any time stressed our age or our greater experience. Now tonight I'm gonna break that rule. I'm considerably older than you are, Simon. And although I've never spoken about it, I've made a very deep study of these esoteric doctrines. I beg of you as I've never begged anything in my life before, give up this desperately dangerous adventure and leave this house with us immediately. I can't. Then let us stay. Impossible. Put him down there, Rex. Thank you, Max. Can you wait outside? Well, I wonder what he's gonna say. Nothing. I'm only bringing him round to put him to sleep again. Makes about as much sense as anything else has tonight. Tilt the lampshade towards me, Rex. Look into the mirror, Simon. Look into the mirror. Keep looking and listen to me. You have been hurt and your mind is troubled, but you are with your friends now. And there is nothing more to worry about. I'm going to send you to sleep, Simon. Your eyes will close as soon as I touch them. You will wake up at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, and your mind will be free from all pain and from all anxiety. Open your eyes, Simon. Stand up. I'm going to place this symbol of protection around your neck. Once it is there, you will not remove it. Now you will go directly to my bedroom where you will lie down and you will fall into an immediate sleep. Max, show Mr. Aron to my room. Thank God that's over. I might agree with you if I knew what you were talking about. We can certainly make good use of these. To our reunion, Rex. No questions? Hocus-pocus, mumbo-jumbo, black magic. Rex, do you believe in evil? As an idea. Do you believe in the power of darkness? As a superstition. Now there you are wrong. The power of darkness is more than just a superstition. It is a living force which can be tapped at any given moment of the night. I tell you these people are devil worshipers. That's ridiculous. These are facts, Rex, not superstition. The final proof was in the hamper. They were about to practice the age-old sacrifice to their infernal master, the slaughter of the black cockerel and the white hen. Yes? I thought I'd better bring this to you, Excellency. My God. He's all right now, sir. Did you remove this, Max? - Yes, sir. - Why? It was choking him to death, Excellency. He rang for me, and when I got here his face was almost black, his tongue protruding. I should have known. I'm sorry, sir, if I've done something wrong. No, that's all right, it's not your fault. We can only hope that he's gone back to his house. Shall I look upstairs while you try down here? I think it's better if we stay together. Rubbish. Don't worry, I'll scream if I so much as smell anything. All right. Well? Not a sign, you? He's not here. Unless up there. It's possible. Is it getting colder up here, or is it my imagination? No, it isn't your imagination. At least we've saved your lives. But no Simon. No. It might help us to locate him if we knew the real names of those people who were here tonight. Real names? Yes. In order to become a follower of the so-called Left Hand Path, one has to be re-baptized in the cause and take the name of some past notable of the occult. That girl, for instance, Ms. Carlisle. I have seen her before. You have, where? Biarritz, at the casino. She was with that old woman, you know, the cigar smoker. Simon called her Tanith, didn't he? So? Tanith happens to be the name of the moon goddess of the Carthaginians. You mean she's been re-baptized? Probably. Well, let's see what we can find and get out of here. What is it? Fantastic. The Clavicule of Solomon. Valuable? Invaluable. What's it made of, cork? It's cold. My God. Don't look at the eyes, Rex. Don't look at the eyes. Don't pull away. Try to hold back. Run! Oh, I take back everything I said. I've never been so scared in all my life. I'm sorry, Rex. Sorry, for saving my life? I should never have allowed you into that place. Forget it, we're out. That's all that matters. Wasn't very pleasant, was it? Pleasant? What in God's name was that thing? Some infernal spirit given entry into the world by Mocata's powers. Obviously, Mocata is one of the great adepts. Perhaps even an Ipsissimus. A what? An Ipsissimus, a master of the highest grade. Simon is in his hands, and he's about to be baptized into the service of evil. When does it take place? Baptism must take place on a true Sabbat with at least one coven of 13 believers present. After tonight, I can't believe that they would dare to hold another meeting, unless... What is it, Nicholas? Do you realize what today's date is, Rex? April the 29th, why? Mocata isn't going to miss the chance of giving Simon his devil's baptism at the grand Sabbat of the year. What are you talking about? Tomorrow night, the eve of May Day. In 24 hours, Simon could be lost to us forever. What can we do? We find the girl. Thank you, good bye. It's all right, Rex. I've found her. Where? She was in a London hotel, the London Plaza. I never knew there were so many hotels in London. It was the 28th one I tried. You should have woken me. Just as well you slept. You need to be more alert today than any other day of your life. Well, let's go then. You'll have to go alone, Rex. It's vital that I should go to the British Museum and examine certain occult volumes that are kept under constant lock and key. Fortunately, the curator's a friend of mine. Well, do you want me to bring Tanith back here? No, I want you to keep her as far away from London as possible. Well, what if I take her to Richard's house? Yes, perfect. I'll telephone to say you're on your way down. I'll see you there about three. It should give you plenty of time. We'll be there. Oh, may I borrow a car? Yes, take any of them. Thanks. What is it you have to say to me? I haven't much time. There's so many things I must do before we leave. We? The Countess and I, we're traveling together. To the Sabbat? Of course. Couldn't you have spoken to me there? In front of Mr. Mocata? I'm hoping that whatever you have to say to me has nothing to do with my loyalty to him. It doesn't. What is it, then? Well, it's just, I just wanted to take you to lunch. If you're free, that is. Take me to lunch? Does that sound such a bad idea? Mr. Van Ryn, you know as well as I do that neither of us is free to give our lives to such things. Why not let me be the judge of that? I think you'd better drive me back. Mr. Van Ryn? Don't ever do that again. What has this Mocata done to make you so afraid of him? It's what he'll do. Oh God, it's what he'll do. Where are you taking me? To see De Richleau. Look, there's nothing to be afraid of. You know better than that. If I'm not at the Sabbat in time-- Is that so important to you? My satanic baptism? You mean, you haven't been re-baptized yet? But your name, Tanith. I was named that at birth. Then you still have a chance. Chance? Look, De Richleau can help you. Believe me, Tanith, he can. I've known De Richleau for many years. And if there's anyone you can put your trust in, it's him. Tanith. Look at me, Tanith, in the mirror. Listen carefully to what I say. You'll have nothing to worry about once we get down to Richard and Marie in the country. In the country? Yes, where we're going. Haven't you been listening? Yes, I've been listening. Peggy, run and wash your hands, will you? Oh, Mummy, must I? Oh, Peggy, yes you must. Uncle Rex will be here in a minute. Won't he have to wash his hands? Yes, I expect so. Why can't I wait till Uncle Rex comes, then go and wash? Then I won't be late. Off, and take that hat off. It's to protect my head. We're having a picnic luncheon, not a gymkhana. If I fall over and split my head wide open-- It'll be my fault, and I'll be very sorry. Now hurry yourself. She'll go like a bird now. Good. This must be Rex and his mysterious woman. There's a car coming. Probably be Uncle Rex. Uncle Rex! Careful! Uncle Rex! Uncle Rex! Hello, Peggy, Marie, Richard. What's going on? I must take your car. Simon's life depends on it. He didn't stay long, did he? Do not be afraid. I'm still with you. He will never catch you. Listen, Tanith, listen and obey. Hello? Rex. What? It's all started. I couldn't phone you earlier, I would have lost them. Where are you? Crossroads. Yes, yes. Yes, I've got that. Now listen, you're not to do anything until I get there, do you understand? You're not to do anything at all. Right. Three turns to the left and then one to the right. The last bit has a very rough surface. Well done, Rex. Here, take these. What are they? The results of my morning's research at the British Museum. Put one in each pocket of your jacket. And may I ask what they are? Salt and mercury, effective against the dark forces. They will protect you and Simon, if we can save him. And you? I have other protection. There. We must get them out of here. Them? Tanith too. Tanith is her real name. This is her baptism as well. Very well, we'll do what we can. My God. The Goat of Mendes. The Devil himself. Let go. You don't understand, Rex. It's not just your life you're risking, it's your very soul. Oh God, if only there was some light. That's it. That's it! Wait, I'll drive. You get on the running board. Kneel and face your master. When we get to the bottom, throw that straight in the face of that damned monstrosity. Right. God help us then. Who so dwelleth under the defense of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. Come on, Simon. Hell of a way to turn up on their doorstep after not having seen them since Christmas. Good morning, Your Grace. Good morning, Malin. My niece and her husband, are they up yet? Yes, sir, I imagine so. Won't you come in? Rex and Uncle Nicholas. What's the matter? You all look so ghastly. I'll explain all that, but first rooms for Ms. Carlisle and for Simon. They're both very badly in need of sleep. Yes, of course. No, I mustn't, I mustn't. You do as I say, my dear. Everything's going to be all right. Marie. Yes, this way. Simon. I can wait, I want to hear what is said and to make my apologies to you all. Very well. Rex, you stay with Tanith. And if anything happens, you call me immediately. You look as if you could do with some sleep yourself. He could. He's been up all night. I'll take a nap later, but now we must talk. Bring us some coffee in, Malin. Yes, sir. There. I'll go before it's night again. Well, you stay as long as you like. No, no, I'll go before it's night. Well, you try and get some sleep now. Oh, Rex, what's this all about? Well, your uncle will explain. I wouldn't know where to start. Go to sleep. I'll be here. Promise me. Promise. I don't want to harm any of you. No. Why couldn't we have met some other way? The way doesn't matter. It does, it does. Does your friend possess any powers at all to resist Mr. Mocata? We got you out of that bedlam last night, didn't we? You've got nothing to worry about, okay? I have everything to worry about. You're quite serious about all this? Deadly serious. It's all true, Richard. All of it. God knows I wish it wasn't. None of us may eat today? Some fruit, a biscuit or two, some water. And no alcohol? I'm sorry. That is if we're to stay. Well, of course you're staying. But the danger. You think we'd let you face it alone? You mean you believe all this? Well, I'm damned. You will find a talk with Rex most valuable, Richard. His skepticism was fully the equal of yours. Now he believes? Ask him. Uncle Nicholas, how can we help? You're already helping, my dear. Simon's resistance is practically nil because he's been under the influence of Mocata for so long. The same thing applies to Ms. Carlisle. Rex and I are at a very low ebb after last night. Your coming fresh into the battle now is of paramount importance. Now I've got to leave you all for a short while, but I'll be back before nightfall. Richard, I want you to sit with Simon while he sleeps. You are not to allow him to get up under any circumstances. Once he gets his head down, I imagine-- Under any circumstances. All right. He is not to be left alone for an instant, you understand? Not for an instant. Good morning. I would like to see Mrs. Eaton, please. My card. Will you please wait here, sir? There's a gentleman to see you, madam, a Mr. Mocata. Well, you better call Mister... No, wait a minute, I'll see him in the library. And Malin, if I ring, come at once. You understand, immediately. Yes, madam. Will you come this way, sir? Thank you. Please forgive me, Mrs. Eaton, for calling without an introduction. But I'm here on an errand of goodwill. Goodwill? I'm returning the property of a friend of yours, the Duc de Richleau. His motorcar. Oh, thank you. May I introduce myself? Mocata, perhaps you've heard my name? I've certainly heard a great deal about you. Ah, I thought that might be the case. But whether the facts have been correctly represented to you is something else again. May I? Very well, but please be brief. Of course. I shan't intrude on you a moment longer than is necessary. Well, now as you probably know, Ms. Tanith and Simon are very close friends of mine. Indeed? Yes, I believe they're here now, is that correct? Why, how did you know that, Mr. Mocata? They only arrived a short while ago. That is neither here nor there, you see. The point is that there are certain matters, of which you are quite naturally unaware, which make it imperative that I should take them back to London immediately. Well, I'm afraid that's quite impossible. I feared you would take that attitude. I know the Duc de Richleau has been filling your mind with all sorts of preposterous nonsense about me. I know that what he said is true. You realize that Tanith and Simon may be in considerable danger if they do not leave this house. On the contrary, they will be safe nowhere else. Mrs. Eaton, it's obvious that you distrust me. And after what your friends have told you about me, I'm not surprised in the least. However, your obvious intelligence emboldens me to think that I will serve my purpose best by putting my cards on the table, as it were. There is no more to be said. Please, hear me out. Dear lady, I do not propose to discuss with you the rights and wrongs of practicing the magic art. I will confine myself to saying that I am a practitioner of some experience. Monsieur de Richleau has, no doubt, led you to believe that I am thoroughly evil. Such is not the case. In magic, there is neither good nor evil. It is merely a science, the science of causing change to occur by means of one's will. The sinister reputation attaching to it is entirely groundless and is based on superstition rather than objective observation. The power of the will is something people do not understand, attributing to it mysterious qualities which it does not possess, being merely the power of mind over matter or in the greater number of cases, the power of mind over mind. As your mind now is succumbing to mine. For as you look into my eyes and listen to my voice, your will is leaving you, slipping away, and you are now beneath my influence. Although your eyes are open and you seem aware, you are, in fact, asleep, your faculties dormant, your ability to act and think subservient to my will. My will. Mrs. Eaton, my will is yours at this point. You cannot function in the least, unless I say so, can you? Answer me, Mrs. Eaton. No. Where is Simon? Upstairs. Alone? My husband is watching him. And Tanith? Upstairs. Alone? No, Rex is with her. Mummy, would you come and... Get out of this house, do you hear me? I want the girl and Simon. Show him out. I am leaving. I shall not be back but something will. Tonight, something will come for Simon and the girl. Richard, what's happened? Oh, nothing, apart from an attempt to strangle me. What? He just woke up, tried to choke me, then went back to sleep again as if nothing had happened. Mocata, he was here. Why didn't you tell me? Well, Uncle Nicholas said that Simon must not be left alone for an instant. Better see if Rex is all right. Rex, Rex, wake up. She's gone. What are you trying to do? What's the matter, Tanith? Come on, we'll go back. No, I'm not going back there. Why not? I almost killed you. Mocata was there. Mocata? He came for me and Simon, but he didn't succeed. He won't give up, can't you see? I can't go back there or he'll make me do something terrible to you and your friends. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to hurt any of you. All right, all right, we won't go back. We'll find somewhere safe to stay until morning. I saw you coming. You look terribly tired. Uncle Nicholas, Mocata's been here. What? He returned your car. He didn't harm you? No, no, no. Simon, where's Simon? Asleep. You're sure? Yes, Richard's watching him. And what about the girl? She's gone. Gone? Rex is with her. He telephoned, but he wouldn't say where. What a fool he is. Doesn't he realize yet what we're up against? She ran away when Mocata was here, and Rex went after her. Then why on Earth didn't he bring her back here then? He explained on the phone. It's through Tanith that Mocata makes his attacks. She's his medium. That's why she's gone. She doesn't want to be close to us. Then why is Rex with her? To try and prevent Mocata from gaining control over her. Pray God he can. As long as it's light, it may be possible. But once the darkness begins to fall-- It's nearly dark. Where's Simon? Saying good night to Peggy in the nursery. What do you want to do about supper? Water, Richard, just water. All right. God bless you, my angel. Good night, Mummy. Good night. I've cleared all the furniture out of the drawing room, Your Grace, as you requested. Thank you, Malin. You're to stay with Ms. Peggy until I tell you otherwise, do you understand? Now to work. All right now. He must be getting weaker. He's been attacking you all afternoon. No, he won't stop. It's too important for him. But why doesn't he come at me with a gun or something? He never risks himself in any way. I can believe that, but this isn't doing him any good. What now? Now we wait. No. Frankly, I think we're behaving like a pack of idiots. It begins. What, what begins? Mocata is working on you because you are the weakest link. From his point of view, Richard. You are the skeptical one. He is looking for an easy way to break the circle. Come on, will you? Is there anything I could say right now that you wouldn't interpret in your own suspicious way? Richard. Well, it's all superstition, black magic. Hell, I'm going for a drink. Richard. You and I have been friends for many years, haven't we? I don't follow you. If I begged you, for the sake of that friendship, to do something for me, would you do it? You know I would. Very well. Then will you stay with me in the circle tonight? You are unafraid. I am not. That's a pretty low trick, appealing to friendship. Will you stay? What else can I do? I wish we had some water. We have. What? There. Yes. Where do you get your water from, a swamp? What? - Taste it. - No, don't touch it. All right, I'll get some fresh. No, that's exactly what he wants you to do. What is it? I'm not certain, but... What? The lights. What about the lights? They seem to be dimmer. No, they're not. Yes. I don't know what you're... It's getting colder. This is to be expected. It's only the beginning. On your feet, quickly! Back to back, join hands. Easy, darling, it's all over now. Hey, what's going on in there? Let me in. Stay still. No! Oh, come on, let me in. It's cold out here, let me in. We must let him in. Who? Do you think that's Rex out there? Let me in. Let me in. What's that? Don't leave the circle! There's a light in the hall. Peggy! - No, Peggy! - No, Marie, no! Let me go! Run! - It's not Peggy. - Peggy! You're out of your mind. Simon! I tell you, it's not Peggy! Peggy! Let go of me! She's upstairs, asleep. Oh God, Peggy. I won't, don't you hear me? I won't! Simon, no! No, Simon, no. Back to back, quickly. Can't we do anything but just stand here? Isn't there any way of fighting back? Only one. What? The last two lines of the Sussamma Ritual. For God's sake, then what are you waiting for? I daren't use them until our very souls are in peril of destruction. To do so would destroy us as effectively as it would stop Mocata. It could alter time and space and-- What is it? He has given up trying to get Simon. He has sent the Angel of Death himself to claim him. And us? If he once breaks into the circle. If we once catch sight of his face. For God's sake, Nicholas, say it! I can't. Richleau! It's over? Yes, Simon, it's all over. She's dead. I know, Rex. The Angel of Death was summoned. He cannot return empty-handed. I'll go and see how Peggy is. Miss Peggy, she is gone. What? What happened? I was watching her when suddenly a kind of darkness came over me. I couldn't see, I couldn't hear. There was nothing I could do, I swear it. I know, Malin, I know. No. Oh my God. He's got her, hasn't he? Simon! Don't try to follow him, Richard. Mocata will know he's coming. To follow him would be suicide. What are we to do then? How are we going to find Mocata? Before me, Raphael. Behind me, Gabriel. On my right hand, Michael. On my left hand, Auriel. In the name of these mighty spirits, I conjure you, Tanith, wherever you may be. Join us in this circle that you may speak with us. With salt, I summon thee. With hair, I summon thee. With blood, I summon thee. The sign of Osiris slain. The sign of Osiris risen. You have called me, I am here. Are you in truth Tanith? I am. Do you acknowledge our Lord, Jesus Christ? I do. Did you come here of your own free will? I came because you summoned me. I came willingly. There is one here whose grief at your passing is very great. He has agreed that you will be summoned back only in the hope that you will help him to protect his friends from evil. Will you help him? I will because I love him. Then tell us where Mocata is. I do not know. Try to find him. I cannot see him clearly. He covers himself with a cloak of darkness. I see the child though, a little girl. Where? I cannot enter. You must. I cannot. The winged serpent guards the way. I cannot enter. Where? I cannot see. You must see. You must enter. I command you to enter. No, please. He is in there, the dark one. Please, don't make me enter. You must enter. No, no, please. I command you to enter. No! Yes, now! I cannot! Stop it! You fool, you damned fool! She's all right. You might have killed her. A winged serpent guarding the way. But where? On the gates of that house. Welcome back, my son. All right, I'm back. You can release the child now. Yes, I have you back. Now I don't have to release the child, do I? What do you mean? You have no use for her. Ah, but I do, my son. A most important use. I have you back. Now the only one I need is Tanith. - You wouldn't-- - Dare? Take your place. Now that our coven of 13 has been restored, we can begin the ceremony. Bring in the child. Now whatever you see, whatever happens, stay close to me. God knows what we will find in there. Almighty and all powerful Set, father of darkness, king of death, I pledge this knife to you. Rex! No, Richard, no! Mocata! Welcome to our circle. What have you done to my baby? She does not hear you. She's in a state of deep hypnosis. In the name of God, you dare not! Scarcely in the name of God, Monsieur le Duc. What's he going to do with her? Uncle? Take me instead, Mocata. You, Monsieur le Duc? Your soul in preference to that of an unstained child? What's he talking about? He isn't going to-- Yes, the transference of souls. That of your child for that of Tanith. No! Now if our two remaining guests will permit, we may proceed. Almighty and all powerful Set, father of darkness, king of death, I pledge this knife to thee, to do thy work and be thy servant. Those words you said before, say them again. And the blood of this child shall be-- I cannot. You must. The end is known not even to us. My baby's going to die if you don't. You must speak those words again. The bride of chaos. The bride of chaos. The rider upon the beast. The rider upon the beast. With this knife do I draw out the blood which is thy life. Only they who love without desire shall have power granted them in their darkest hour. Peggy, get up. Repeat after me the words of the Sussamma Ritual. It's over? Yes, Simon, it's all over. Peggy. Wasn't... Tanith. Come in, my friends. She's all right. Tanith! Time itself has been reversed for us. Tanith's death, Peggy's abduction, the ride to Chilbury, the ritual in the cellar, all these things happened, but now they have not happened. We are back. We are all safe again. And is Mocata also safe? You will also remember, Simon, what I said to you about the Angel of Death. Once being summoned-- Cannot return empty-handed. Exactly. Tanith has been restored to us, but the age-old law demands a life for a life, a soul for a soul. And there is only one man in all this world who can replace her life, her soul. The man who invoked the Angel of Death. Mocata is dead. Thank God. Yes, Simon. He is the one we must thank.
