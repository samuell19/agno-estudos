Hey, Adeline, we made it. I know, sweetie, I know. Imagine what you can do here. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the food we are about to receive. Watch over those who need your guidance most in their times of trouble. In Jesus's name, Amen. Amen. Oh, you know what? Somebody bought that old farm out on State Route 47. You're kidding. Yeah. How did you find out? Milly. Well, if anybody would know... You know what? John, Milly is an informed citizen. Uh-huh. You want everyone in town to know something, just tell Milly it's a secret. Be good to do something nice for her. Milly? No, our new neighbor. She drove all the way here with just a horse for company. So, I don't know, maybe we do a little barbecue, everybody brings something over, and do it at her new farm! The whole town just walk on over without even a how-do-you-do? It was just a thought. I'll be back. It's a good one. Why don't I announce it on Sunday? Unless you think Milly could spread the word faster. So bad. There you go, bud. Milly also mentioned a new support group in Columbus for parents of autistic children. Might be nice to talk to some people who know what we're going through. Going through? It just might help to talk. I know it would help me. Well, then, you can go. I need to be at church. You are always at church. You just don't get a lot of alone time, you know, to vent. We've put him through enough, dear. I'm not ready to give up hope. Hope's good. But the pain when it fails... I can't watch your hopes get crushed again. This is the path God has laid for us. We have to walk... I hate when you preach at me. Well, you married a preacher. For better or for worse. Okay, that's fair. I just want what's best for our son. Same as you. And maybe this will just help us be better for him. Where exactly did Milly hear about this support group? Facebook. Okay, fine. Look it up. No promises, though. Okay! I love you, champ. Good boy. Adeline! Let's go make a new friend. Come on, Jason! Keep him under control, boy! You got it. Whoa! Yankee, stop! Trot, Yankee, come on. Hey, come on, let's go! You're the boss, son! I can't hold on, he's too wild! Whoa! Jason, are you all right? Come on, Yankee, why you got to make this so hard? Yankee ain't ready! He sure is stubborn, Pop. But I'll break him! Give it another go after my morning chores. Before you do anything else, you go clean up that head of yours. Oh, I'm definitely going to break him now! Go get cleaned up, boy. That's a tough son you have there. Yeah, I'm lucky to have him. His mother died giving birth, you know. He should have died, too, but wouldn't quit. I like to think that when she died, she passed her grit on to him. I'm sure she did. So, Ms. Miller, you're in the market for another horse. Yes, I am. Mr. Henderson. Kay. Matt. So, I'd like to buy one today. And then maybe another in a few weeks. Oh. Are these all Appaloosas? No, but the ones that are come from Chuck Schroeder's stock. Got registration papers for all of them. And that one? Oh yeah, he's exactly what you're looking for. No, Yankee ain't ready. If you're looking for a good, reliable horse, I'd recommend Charm over there. Now, she comes from a long line of show horses who have... Kay? You beautiful yellow thing! Adeline seems to like you. How much did you say you wanted for him? He's here. One minute, everything's fine, and then the next minute she's lighting something on fire. I know this isn't the first time. But fostering Bethany is doing the Lord's work. We're just at our wit's end, John. That's the honest to God truth. I feel your pain, and it's okay. Jeff, it's okay to be emotional. These are very difficult issues you're dealing with. I don't know what the Lord's plan is for her, but I know he does have a plan. And I'm here for you, okay? Reverend, I'm sorry. We didn't ask you over here for advice. Oh. She's really too much for us to handle. And you're sure about this. We've talked about it, John, a lot. And then a lawyer stood up and asked, Teacher, what exactly do I have to do to inherit eternal life? Nothing like a lawyer to get right to the point, huh? So Jesus asked, what does the law say? The lawyer gets it right: Love the Lord, your God, with all you've got. Jesus says, yep. But the lawyer raises the obvious question: okay, but, who is my neighbor? The answer? Everyone. Every single human being, friend or enemy, that's your neighbor and mine. Now, as most of you all know, we have ourselves a new neighbor here in York's Creek down at the old Macon Farm, Kay Miller. And my very smart and beautiful wife thought it would be a good idea to show her that she's surrounded on all sides by good neighbors. Amen? Amen! Amen? Amen! There we go. So what do you say next Sunday after church we all head on over and throw Kay a little potluck barbecue... yeah? Yes! All right. Now, go in peace and may God be with you. Amen. Oh, Betty, Betty, wait. Hey, can we count on you for your famous potato salad? All right. Thank you. Have a wonderful day. Bye, thank you! Hi, thank you. Thanks for coming. Bye, thanks. Lovely sermon, Pastor. Thank you, Betty. I'm serious about that salad, now. It won't be a welcome party without it. Bye-bye. Such a fine idea, Pastor. Terry, you ought to come down to the salon so we can start planning. For the life of me, I just can't think of what to bring! Oh, don't worry, Milly, you'll think of something. And if you don't, you can always find a recipe on Facebook. Take care, now. You are so... It's Milly, come on. Come on. It's Milly! It's so obvious, though! No, it's not! Okay, come on, bud. Let's go. Can I help you? Ms. Miller, I'm Rev. John Sommers. This is my wife Terry and our son Adam. My wife and I thought, well... We thought you might like a welcoming party. All right. Let's give it a go! Please, please, come in. I'm just getting settled, but... Sorry, Kay, I don't think everyone's going to fit. Oh. That's a lot of people. We had to invite everyone, you know. We don't do anything halfway. No. Absolutely. Come on in. Come on in! This is such a nice surprise. Well, we had to welcome our newest neighbor. I definitely feel welcomed. Good. Terry, who's that your husband's talking to? Oh, that is Jeff and Susan Wilson. Probably having trouble with Bethany again. Oh yeah. Who's Bethany? The town crazy. Every town has one and Bethany is ours. That's enough, Milly. Let's not drag Kay into drama she doesn't have to worry about. Oh my, I don't think that we've met. Oh, how rude of me! Milly Soames. I own the beauty parlor and I would love to do something with that hair, if you'd like. Excuse me for a minute. Sure. I didn't offend her, do you think? I mean, her hair looks okay. So, you've met Adeline. I wasn't doing anything wrong. I know. You wander off on your own a lot? Your parents must get awfully worried about you. They're not my real parents and they couldn't care less about me. You don't need to use that tone with me, Bethany. How do you know my name? A little bird told me. A little bird. More like that cow, Milly Soames. And I don't like name-calling. Who are you, anyways? I'm Kay, this is my farm, and these are my horses. What are they, rescues? No, kind of the opposite, really. Right. Yeah, I'm going to go. Now, what makes you think that your parents don't care about you? Foster parents. I heard them talking to the Reverend the other day. They don't want me. Said I'm too much for them to handle. Maybe you just misunderstood. There's nothing to misunderstand. They don't want me. Why should they? None of the others did. Bethany! What on earth? I knew we'd find her in the barn. All this hay must have seemed like striking gold! Bethany! Rev. Sommers, Rev. Sommers! Bethany tried to burn the barn down! Look, you need to shut up. She did nothing of the sort. Aren't any of you going to go after her? If we did, she'd just keep running. Best we just let her be. She'll be back after dark. That's hardly responsible! I'm not going to keep her on 24-hour surveillance, Milly. Can you just mind your own business for once? Jeff, Jeff, let's just calm down. I'm sorry, Reverend, but the day I start taking parenting advice from Milly Soames... Kay, what happened? She just wanted to see the horses, that's all. We started talking and... She talked to you? She won't even talk to her psychiatrist. Psychiatrist. Bethany has some serious emotional and psychological problems. She's a pyromaniac, John. She's been diagnosed. Just call it what it is. So you thought she was trying to burn my barn down. We love her. We do, but we don't know how to help her. She can't control it. How many families has she been with? Five, and some of them were bad. Really, really bad. She's barely 15. Well, what if I take her? If that's all right with you and okay with her, maybe she can stay with me for a while. I'm sorry, did you say move in? Well, with your permission. And I could become her temporary guardian. You know, just for a little bit and see how we do, and go from there. Kay, I don't think you understand the whole situation here. Oh, I do understand it perfectly. She's not the first lost soul I've come across. I know how she feels. I'm at a loss. But, ask and ye shall receive sayeth the Lord. Amen, Reverend. Ms. Kay, I... Oh. Oh! So, this is your room. I'm sorry it's so small, but you got to start somewhere. It's a small house. It's fine. Thanks, Ms. Miller. Kay, call me Kay. None of this Ms. Miller stuff. If anything, we're roommates. Maybe down the road, friends? Who knows, got to start somewhere. What's that? Oh, that was given for a special horse I once knew by the name of Old Mac. It was given to him when he was 50, making him the oldest living horse in America. Knew. So, he died then? Yeah, yeah, some years ago. Oh. Right. So, uh, this is your room now, and you're welcome to decorate it any way that you'd like. I can take that plaque down and you can paint the walls, put up posters of... whatever you girls are into these days. Jason Momoa. Jason... okay, all right. Chores, let's talk about chores. I hope you like it here. I know you've been through a lot. Hey, watch your head there, girl. Hey, Jason! Oh, hey! Thanks for all your help today. Oh, it's nothing. You want to take a break? Sure, thanks. Have a seat. Yeah. It's nice of your dad to let me have you for a couple of days and help out here. Hey, give that back to me, you silly horse! Silly horse is right! Oh, she sure is sassy, isn't she? Is that why you got her? Well, not exactly. Although she is a character. Don't you just love being center of attention? This horse was given to me by a dear friend of mine a long time ago. Adeline is a very special horse with many gifts. She sure is. She's gorgeous. Aren't you, Adeline? Huh, aren't you? I don't know what I'd do without her. Yankee, the most stubborn, ornery horse I have ever seen, is suddenly as gentle as an angel. And, mind you, this is five minutes after he cracked Jason's head open. And he's bound to her like she's some queen or something. I've never seen anything like it. I've seen some circus horses do that once. It's a neat trick. Yeah, but a horse like Yankee? She up and bought him, then and there. You try and talk her out of it? Yeah, but she said she knew what she was doing. Just think with Bethany, knows her five minutes then, bam. Not quite sure what to make of this woman, Matt. Oh, come on, John, she's nice. Hey, you remember Mr. Macon's horse, Samson? How could I forget? Stud for the ages, fast as the wind. Ever tell you I snuck out and took him out for a ride once? What? No, you did not. Rode him about 50 yards before he bucked me off. I rolled away, but he just turned and charged me like a bull. Never forget that. Sorry. I guess I never told you! I got grounded for it. What! You had to know it was me. Of course I did! Nobody else was that reckless, and it wasn't me causing trouble. Why didn't you tell anyone? Always back your best friend's play. Amen to that. Amen to that. Why don't you say a prayer for the fish now. So sudden. People tried to warn her. Poor thing. That farm's going to be ashes in a month. Well, I for one, think there's something just not right about that woman. She seemed nice to me. So did your ex. All I'm saying is if something's too good to be true, it probably is. Ooh, yes, Milly. Well, now, you all need to ease up. That poor girl has got a history of abuse and neglect, and I think it was very nice of Kay to take her in. She's got a history of setting things on fire and watching them burn. If that's not basket-case material, I don't know what... Excuse me, ladies, am I interrupting something? Not at all. Kay, would you like to join us? Actually, I was hoping to have a quick word. Do you mind? Of course. Baby, mommy is going to go outside with the nice horse lady, okay? Again, ladies, my apologies. What do you think that's about? Sorry about interrupting the... Gossip circle? It's okay. I actually wanted to invite you and Adam out to the farm as a thank you for that wonderful welcome party. Oh. I thought maybe Adam might like a ride on Adeline. Oh, umm, uh, that's... it's very nice of you. I'm not sure it's a great idea. Well, Adam will be perfectly safe, I promise. Well... well, it sounds wonderful. I'll speak to John about it. Thank you! Thanks, very much. Sure. We'll see you soon. Okay. All right, I will see you all on Sunday. Meeting adjourned. Hey, John. What's up, buddy? Guess what? Our new neighbor is coming over tomorrow to buy another horse. Another one? I know! She's the talk of the town. Maybe that's her goal. What do you mean? She seems to enjoy it, surprising people, acting unusual. It's strange. Strange how nice she is, you mean? No, no, no. It's got nothing with being nice. Something about her, it just doesn't sit right with me. I can't put my finger on it, but... But? I'm starting to think we might have thrown that welcome party a little too quick. I'm sorry. I don't want to be like this, I'm so sorry! How are the horses? I'll go pack. Now, why would you do that? What were you doing in the barn? I was going to set it on fire. But Adeline, she stopped me. How? She just looked at me... with that weird blue eye. It was like she was looking right through me. It felt like I just woke up. It's hard to explain, but nobody's ever looked at me like that. And just like that, I didn't want the fire anymore. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. She really did look at me. I believe you, Bethany. You do? Adeline's a very special horse. So, is this going to last? Am I cured? I don't know. Everyone's different. But the more you're around Adeline, the more... So I still might be crazy. Bethany, don't... No, it's fine. I don't want to hurt anyone. I'll go pack. You will do nothing of the sort, young lady. You're not going anywhere. If you think I'm going to chuck you out after your first mistake, then maybe you are crazy. I was going to burn your barn down! You were, but you chose not to. And that choice is very important. It was Adeline, she stopped me. Adeline knew what you were about to do. She needs you to let it go. I don't understand. You will. Adam, open your eyes. I so appreciate you inviting us out like this. Adam has never been around horses and he's not big on new situations, but he seems to like Adeline. I thought he might. Bethany seems to be adjusting well. She's a brave girl. And how are you adjusting having a teenager under your roof? Oh, it's not much different than wrangling an ornery horse, really. Come to get a look at the freak? Huh? Well, you can leave, I'm not planning on setting anything on fire anytime soon. You're wasting your time. I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. Don't make fun of me. I'm not. I just really like horses. I'm home-schooled, I just help out at the farm. Just taking a break. Oh, sorry. It's okay. People make fun of you a lot, huh? Since the day I was born, it feels like. The crazy girl. Hmm. Some people. Why do they think you're crazy? Because I am. You don't seem crazy. So, Yankee is your horse? Mm-hmm. Well, sort of. He sure is beautiful. I wish I had my own horse. Kay picked up two last week and bought one yesterday as an adoption present. If you tease me about being adopted, I swear I'll hit you. Whoa, relax. We just met. Why would I make fun of you? I'm Jason. I'm Bethany. Nice to meet you. If you can tame Yankee, you must be pretty special. And Bethany's problem? Is that you asking, or Milly and the gossip circle? Oh, no, I'm just concerned about your safety. Well, thank you. I mean, everything is going just fine. You got her seeing a new psychiatrist? Oh, Bethany doesn't need a knew psychiatrist. She's seeing Adeline. Your horse? Mm-hmm. Adeline's a medicine horse. Would you look at that. I've never seen him do anything like that, not in eight years. He's... hey, buddy. He's so calm. He and Adeline are sharing space right now. Hey, baby! Do you like her? Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Don't look at me like that, John! I know, I know how it sounds. But it's not the first time Adeline's done this. Healed? What in Heaven's name are you saying? Don't get upset. I can't explain it any more... Okay, okay, I'll explain it for you. Adam's never been on a horse before and for some reason it calmed him down. Great. But healed? We have no idea what Kay's background is. For all we know, she's like some sort of... Okay, what are you talking about? She didn't cast a spell on him, she just let him ride her horse. After all this time, all the doctors, if there's finally something that might help our son can't we just at least explore it or... Terry, you're getting taken in. He's not healed, you just want to believe he is. Open your eyes, look at him. You look at him. That is our son. That is how he is. The Lord is sovereign and this was his decision, and no amount of hoping or praying or magic horses is going to change that. That's not what's going on. We can't subject Adam to anything else. Terry, can you trust me on this? Yeah. Hello, John, everything all right? What is going on in here? Why don't we go outside and talk? How can you prey on these people? John, I don't know what you're talking about. Medicine horses? They're animals. You know, the Navajo consider the horse as a gift from the Great Spirit, a means of healing. They don't even call them medicine horses, they just say horse. Lee-gee is their word. Fascinating. How's Adam? John, you misunderstand me. I don't know what you're after... but I'm going to find out. You're telling me she calls them magic horses. Of course not, Tim, she calls them medicine horses. That's not the point. She's lying to these people. John, as far as I can tell she lets kids ride her horses. That's not a crime. In fact, I think it's kind of sweet. She tells the parents that the horses are healing their kids. I mean, if she's taking money from them, too, that's fraud, isn't it? All right, I'll pay her a visit. But so help me, if I find out she's just a nice lady letting children ride her horses, you need to drop it. You hear me? Okay. Doesn't look good, having the local Pastor start a witch hunt. Just check it out, okay? That knee, huh? Yeah. Adam, Adam, shh! Hey, hey! Baby, it's okay, it's okay, we're almost there, okay? Just a few more minutes. Mama's going to make it better, okay? Almost there. Okay, she's finished. Bethany? Hi! Hey! Hey, there, Adam. How are you, champ? I'm glad you're back. There's a bit of a wait, but if you don't mind? No, no, no, we don't mind at all. Do we, Adam, huh? Okay, we're just going to go sit. Hi. Busy today. Boy, you're telling me. You guys from around here? Memphis, actually. Tennessee? You know another one? It's quite a ways. We would have driven further if we had to. You know, after we read Dr. Miller's study on the effectiveness of equine therapy, we knew we had to bring Lacey. M-S. - Mmm. I'm sorry, did you say Dr. Miller? That's right, Doctor of Psychology, PhD in Holistic Medicine. You didn't know? It never came up. I'm not going to lie, we were a little skeptical. Over 30 specialists, you know? I do know. Still, to come all this way is... Oh, that's nothing. That family over there, they came from Beijing. Isn't that the preacher's wife? Yeah, her son's got autism. Man, couldn't imagine that. Being normal inside, really smart actually, but stuck in your own little world. He doesn't talk. At all. Makes my problem seem pretty stupid, huh? Hey, now, go easy. You don't get to choose the bad things that have happened to us. No sense comparing. Me, I never knew my mom. Some people got it worse, sure. But I still miss her and it still hurts. I don't got to apologize. My dad says my mom really liked horses. Maybe that's why I like them too. 2 Corinthians 11:14... Even Satan himself masquerades as an Angel of Light. Did you hear that? Just because it looks good doesn't mean it is good. We got to be careful, family. We got to stay close to the Truth or we may find ourselves conned by our own wishful thinking. He loves her! Oh. All right, that's about it. Thank you. Been a real pleasure spending the afternoon with you and your horses, Ms. Kay. I'll tell the Reverend he can relax. Thank you, Sheriff. You're welcome any time. Thanks. I hope your knee is feeling better. Oh, it's... How did you know about that? Huh. Everything all right? I truly cannot believe it. He was diagnosed at two and a half. And he would have these episodes where he would just scream, like for hours. We tried everything. Behavioral therapy and medication and... he's just always been... I mean, you've seen him. John figured it's just how God meant him to be. And honestly, I couldn't argue. But now, just... Kay, I... I had to sneak Adam over here today. John doesn't want us here. I know. He made that very clear when he stopped by the other day. He was here? I tried talking to him. It was John who asked Sheriff Dooley to come over and check things out. Oh my goodness, I'm, I am so sorry. I'm, I'm... John was not always like this. He wasn't. But when Adam was diagnosed he just... I don't know, he changed. And he says he's fine, but he's... now we actually have something that's working and he's, he's just... Fearful. Well, I was going to say stubborn. Oh, that too. It's human nature. I just wish he could see what's happening here. Maybe some medical explanation or... I think I can help with that. Really? Really. But it's getting late, so why don't you and Adam stay for dinner and we can talk? Is it, is it dinner time already? How long have we been here? Thank you so much for the offer, but we really, we should probably get going, okay? You ready to go, buddy, huh? You ready? Thank you so much. More. Did you hear that? Did you hear him? He said, he said more. You said more! Oh my gosh, baby! You said more. He's never done that before! That was the most beautiful sound I've ever heard. You know what? We will give you a little more. We will wait a minute. Oh... Okay. Goodness, you are getting so heavy. Ooh, there we go. My little limp noodle. There we are. Okay. John, listen, our son spoke today. Okay, he was sitting on Adeline and they went to take him down, and he said more. He said more, John! That's impossible. No, it's true, I was there! No, I don't know what you think you heard. I heard our son's voice is what I heard! Adam can't talk. Why don't you believe me? Adam can't talk! Terry, she's a fraud. It's all just a big act. I'm sure it was convincing, and I don't blame you, but you need to open your eyes. Sheriff Dooley is going to expose her... Oh, Sheriff Dooley? Yeah. He was there today, John. He was there! He thanked her for a wonderful day with the horses. You are the only one who thinks that there is something wrong there! I can see you're too far gone. I'm going to look after Adam from now on. Stop it. I'm going to take him to all his appointments with Dr. Anders, take care of his daily needs... John, are you not seeing what's going on? I'm the only one who sees what's going on, and I'm doing what's best for Adam. No, I will not let you do this. I won't, you can't. She's helping him! No! I'm helping him. John, you don't... Gentlemen, Dr. Kay never asked anyone for money. They just donated, okay? So as far as I can tell, that's not against the law. In fact, she's so broke she can barely keep the lights on. And everyone says the same thing... Dr. Kay and her horses are saving my child's life. Dr. Kay and her horses are performing miracles. We have prayed for someone like Dr. Kay and her horses since the day our daughter was born. Told you, John. She's just a nice woman. Yeah, there's just one kind of odd thing. There is no record of a Dr. Kay Miller anywhere in the state of New Mexico. There is no record of a Dr. Kay Miller anywhere in the entire United States, not so much as a birth certificate, a passport, or a driver's license. So, what? So maybe he's lying about the whole doctor thing. Maybe she's lying about who she is or where she's from. But running away from your past does not necessarily make you a criminal. So, gentlemen, other than not being able to prove that this woman even exists, as far as I can tell she's about as close to being a saint as anyone I've ever met. You see? Hey, Zippo! Can I borrow a light? Hey, I said, can I borrow a light? Hey! You deaf, Zippo? Hey, I'm talking to you. Man, forget it. What? You afraid of getting burned? No, just don't want to miss the movie. Shut up, this is better than a movie. Hey, can I borrow a light? Hey, sorry for running late. My dad should be along shortly. Hey, man, you know your girlfriend is freaking crazy, right? Doesn't she live with the weird voodoo horse lady? Jason, don't. It's not worth it. Yeah? But you are. Come on, let's go. You got a problem with me, boy? No, not as long as you apologize. Ooh. And what if I don't want to, hero? Maybe I'll talk you into it. You don't look like you're much of a talker. Get him, Luke. Man, we're going to miss the movie. Relax! He's as crazy as his little girlfriend! Well, you know, that's the funny thing about crazy people. You never really know what they're capable of. Come on, you all. Let's... Oh! Lost that bet! Now, apologize. I'm sorry! Just having some fun, man. What are you all doing here! Let's go, let's go. You want to tell me how that boy got that gusher? Just a little discussion about manners, Ms. Soames. Oh, okay. Family, you must remember... Remember that the Devil, the Devil is cunning. Adam! Adam, no! Come on. No, no, no, no, no. No, no. Come here. You can't be doing that, you can't be ripping up the Bible. Stay. No, no, no, no, no. Stay. All right? Oh, Dear Lord. I don't judge anyone from their past. Lord knows I've had my own indiscretions. So if that's what it is, I won't think any less of you... Terry. Yes? You worry too much. Yeah. The reason that Sheriff Dooley couldn't find my name in any records is because my name isn't Kay. It's Michelle. Michelle Miller. Well, Michelle is a lovely name. It is. It's just not quite right. Not for me, and not for a long time. You see, when I was in college, I got sick. Really sick. I was ready to die. Picked out my spot under a little tree and everything. Sat down and waited to pass on. Except I didn't. Because that's when I met Jack Redfeather and a truly great medicine horse, Old Mac. Old Mac was the first horse that showed me how horses could be the medicine I needed. It was just a matter of time before I was using horses to help others heal. And then Adeline came along. She was the most gifted horse I'd ever seen. I guess this is my way of paying it forward. Why don't you tell more people this story? Because it's kind of personal. And it isn't about me. But it could help people like John who need to open their eyes and... The only person who can open John's eyes is John. So where does the name Kay come from, then? The tree that I chose to die under was a willow tree. And in Jack's language, Navajo, the name of that tree is... Kay. I have to show John, I do. Is there any way that you could get those medical records, please? I'll make you a copy. She had leukemia, John. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Who's got leukemia? Kay did, but she doesn't anymore. Look, these are hospital records. Okay, doctor's notes and charts, and she's got a ton of get well cards. She was dying and a medicine horse named Old Mac healed her. Terry, you need to stop this. Read it! You look like a crazy person right now. This is legitimate medicine. Okay, and it's not just Kay. I did my research. It is practiced all over the world, there have been studies. I want to take Adam to see Kay's horses. He's not going to heal. How can you say that if you won't even try? Because I know what happens when you try... nothing! Oh my gosh, open your eyes! Terry, you need to stop... Why can't God work through horses? Maybe that's part of his plan. It wouldn't be the first random recovery that's ever happened. And you can't prove it was the horse! And how hard is it, really, to forge hospital records? Oh my... you are a stubborn mule of a man! I'm stubborn? Which one of us has never been able to accept Adam the way he is? Who is always wishing for something different instead of being content with God's decision to afflict our son? What happened to you? I came to my senses. No, you broke. You used to say that God is good, that God is love, that He hears us. And then Adam was born and we prayed and we trusted and we tried, and we never gave up. And then... one day, you did. You hate him, don't you? Of course not. I love him. Well, then you must hate me. Is that it? Is it because I gave you an autistic son? Or is it because I found a way to hope when you weren't strong enough to? I don't hate you. Well, then, why won't you let me help our son? Because I refuse to stand here and beg for a miracle when the whole reason we're in this situation is because of Him. You want to talk about magic horses? Well, why couldn't God just get it right the first time? Maybe just, maybe he was drunk that day, I don't... We need to get to the basement. Adam, come on. Come on! It's all right, it's going to be okay. This storm is unlike any other. Yes, this area is prone to tornadoes and heavy systems, but we have never seen anything like this, in November of all months. We encourage everyone to take cover. Find a basement, find a place you can be safe... Jason. From this storm, now. Please, God. You, just light... yep. Good. Hey, Cirrey! Come here, girl. Come on, Cirrey, let's go. You're the parents? Nice to meet you. Tornado! Take cover, let's go, come on! - Get against the wall! - Go! Run, Maggie! Angela! Hurry, hurry, everyone! Hey, get up to the wall, get up to the wall! Get behind the stalls, go. Come on! This is a strong barn. - We can't outrun a tornado! No, Bethany! Bethany, come here, come here! Come on! Here it comes! Oh, oh... Bethany? Bethany. Are you all right? Okay. Oh, oh... - Are you all right? - Are you okay? - We'll be okay. How is Adeline? Ms. Miller? I'm Dr. Gibbs, this is Dr. Shaffer. Call me Kay. How is she? She's stable, but she shattered one of her metatarsal bones below the hock. It's my duty to advise you... No. Ms. Miller, please understand... I understand perfectly. It's not an option. Jason! Dad! Oh gosh, surviving that tornado... it's your mother's grit again. I thought you were gone. Never. Angela is okay, just a few stitches. Everybody else is pretty banged up, but they're all right. How is Adeline? She has a shattered leg. Just below the hock. And Dr. Gibbs here was just about to tell me that we should put her down. What? No, can't you fix her? We can set the bones and we can cast the leg but it'll take months to heal, during which time her other leg will have to carry her entire weight which is half a ton. It'll break, too. You're not killing our horse. We shouldn't prolong Adeline's suffering. Now, every horse is special, but... No, not like Adeline! She saved our lives. It's true. The tornado came right through the barn and Adeline just pushed all thirteen of us against the wall and stood there. She didn't run? Is that true? Look, I can tell that you've all been through a lot and I'll leave you to discuss it, but I must tell you again there's nothing we can do. I truly am sorry. My deepest condolences. I'm so sorry, Kay. I know how much Adeline means to you. Matt... if Adeline dies... the healing stops. The Book of Jonah Chapter one, verse 12... And He said unto them, take me up and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you. For I know that, for my sake, this great tempest is upon you. Family, we may find it hard to accept, but God does not make mistakes. And His judgments, while harsh, are just. Only one farm was hit by that tornado. No. - No. - No. - That is so wrong. I take no pleasure in telling you this. - You're out of line, John. You cannot think this was a coincidence. I... - Tell the truth. You okay? What are they doing here? Ms. Miller, I'm Eli Hershberger. I own Hershberger Lumber. Please, call me Kay. Ma'am. But what... We heard about what happened and about the work that you do here, and we figured that you might need some help rebuilding. And we have come to offer a hand. But how did you find out? We come into town from time to time to get supplies, and... are you familiar with Milly Soames? All right, then. We'll be back soon with others to help you raise a barn. Hey, about time you showed up. I already caught most of the fish. I'm joking, geez. You need to stop this. She lost two horses and nearly her entire barn. Why can't you just leave her alone? Matt, she's a fraud. She ain't done nothing wrong! She is a good woman! She is a good woman, and she needs the town's support right now. She needs your support, neighbor. I'm supporting this town and its people. What happened to always backing your best friend's play? This time... you ought to back mine. Hey, Dr. Gibbs? Joe, was is it? Hey, I've been looking at Adeline's case, and... can I just show you something? Okay, so... I know we're dealing with, right, a horse with a broken... So I'm thinking if we put two pins here... To oversimplify what's clearly going to be an incredibly difficult surgery, Adeline needs to be able to walk within the first hour. Which may rebreak her leg or break the other. I need to emphasize the amount of risk that we're taking, because this is, this procedure has never been done. But do you think it will work? I wouldn't be here if I didn't. And you'll be her doctor the entire time? Every second. Do it. But just promise me, if she's suffering you'll tell me. Immediately. How much is this going to cost? Hard to say. $15,000? But I've already spoken with Dr. Gibbs and we're both willing to donate our time. We could probably get it down to $10,000. That's awfully generous of you, but we don't have that kind of money. I wouldn't even know how to raise it. We'll figure something out, Kay. Come on, Terry, who's going to give us $10,000? And then there's the recovery cost, right? You okay? I'm worried. Hey, girl. Don't worry. We're going to figure this out. I know you miss Yankee. He was a great friend. He's looking over us right now. The fact is you saved us, Adeline. We need you. Adam... Bethany... all of the others. I need you. You have so much more good to do in this world, so many more to heal. Don't let go. Let the doctors help you. It's our turn to help you now. Can you feel it? Can you feel us praying for you? Hang in there, girl. We're here for you. She's going to be okay. What if she's not? Adeline needs us right now. Hey! We're alive right now, aren't we? We could be dead! I know, you're right. What are you going to do after this is all over? I mean, stay here? With Kay? Yeah, I guess. It depends. Will you help me with the chores? If I can keep the lighter. I wasn't even going to do anything with it. Mm-hmm! - Hey! Hey, morning, Tom, Mark. How are them Buckeyes doing this year? Morning, Reverend. Tom, have you heard? I haven't been keeping track, I'm sorry. It's all right. You guys have a good day. Come on, buddy, let's go. Morning, Fran. The usual, Reverend? Just a cup of coffee today, thanks. You want it to go? Uh... yeah, that'd be great. I do need to get back to the church. You got it. There you are. - Thanks very much. - Thank you. - You have a good one. - You too. Come on, bud. Yoohoo! Morning, Rev. Sommers! Morning, Milly. Is it just me, or is everyone acting truly strange this morning? You haven't seen this morning's paper, have you? Front page, check it out. Reverend's wife raises money for hero horse Sweet Adeline of Serendipity Stables... saved the lives of thirteen people... groundbreaking surgery... Terry Sommers, wife of York Creek's Rev. John Sommers calls on the community to donate what they can to save a special healing horse that has saved so many oth... Seriously, Milly? Was anybody going to tell me? Thanks for the information. Any time. Yeah. I already donated a few bucks myself. It's going viral on Facebook! Bethany, can you get that, please? Oh, afternoon, Bethany. I got some mail for you. You okay? Yeah, just not used to that kind of workout. Hey, Dan. Oh, hey, Kay. Sorry, you must not have seen the new mailbox. Oh, I saw it. It's just that for what you got you're going to need about 12 of those. And this is just half of it. Dear Ms. Kay, I read how your remarkable horse saved all those people. It's not much, but here's $20 for the surgery. Good luck, Zeke. Your horse sounds very nice and I want her to feel better. I'm sorry I can only give $3, but it's all the allowance I get. I hope she gets well so she can help more kids. Tommy, P.S. I'm five. I'm sorry, this is just so sweet. Can I get you another cup of coffee, Dan? Yeah, that'd be wonderful. You know, if you stack the donations to one side I could tally them up for you. Well, don't you have more stops to make? I do, but they can wait. You know, a lot of these are from people right here in town. Of course they are. York's Creek is a big, happy family. We look after one another. Isn't that the way the good Lord wanted it? It sure is. Mom, I... Yes, darling? I think we need to call Adeline's doctors. I think we should, too. Hey, how's everyone doing? We're, we're ready. And I just wanted to say again how deeply touched I am by your guys's trust, and how inspired I am by your courage. Thank you, doctor. You're a God send. Pray for me anyway, all right? Oh, I'm sorry, this is my sister, this is Holly. She's been spending some time with Adeline and, if it's all right with you, she'd like to sit with you during the procedure? Of course. It's nice to meet you, Holly. This is my daughter, Bethany. Hi. Hey. All right, well, I should get in there. You all stay strong, okay? Well, I think this is the part where we all start praying. Amen. Please turn in your Bibles to Ezekiel chap... I'm sorry, please turn in your Bibles to Ezekiel chapter six. Brush all her hair back and you can make a little unicorn. Hey, guys, they're ready for you. Okay, let's go. Come on, buddy, going to go see Adeline, okay? Hey, you. Oh, there you go, there you go. There you go. Okay. Let's go, let's go. Good girl, you were sick. I guess the surgery went well. Honestly, it was flawless. She was up in less than an hour. I've honestly never seen anything like it. I don't know how we can thank you enough, doctor. Call me Joe. And you can thank me after she's fully recovered. But something tells me that you're going to break some more records, huh? Well, this calls for a celebration. We have to have the whole town come out. Oh, Terry, no, that's not necessary! Piddly-posh, it is happening! Joe, you're invited, Holly, you're invited, Jason. Everybody's coming. As long as I don't have to give a speech. Or me! Hi, Adeline. Hi, Adeline. Okay, talk. Clearly, you're trying to say something. I'm trying to do what's right here. That's all I've ever tried to do. My son is a prisoner in his own body. And that happened on your watch. And now I'm supposed to believe that some voodoo horse is going to heal him? When nothing else has worked? I don't understand. I never have. We gave you our lives, everything. And you gave us Adam. And you gave us Adam! Oh God, every good and perfect gift. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Hey! Well, they say it takes a village. It sure does. To think what this town would be like without you and your horses. Thank you. That means a lot. I mean it. If we had lost Bethany and those that were with her, I can't imagine. You have done so much for us. It's been good for me, too. And Adeline. I've got to go find Jeff. I'll see you in there. I know! And I don't even know how you pulled this off, Terry. It's not that hard. You tell the right person and it spreads like wildfire. I know, it's so wild, right? I'm so glad you could join us, John. Thank you, Kay. Would you mind saying a few words? Um, that would be great, thank you. Hey, everyone, gather around. Some of you may recall that I said that God does not make mistakes. I thought I knew what that meant. I didn't. Not until this very day. Look at this. Look what can happen when people decide to see the good in each other, the good that God put into the world. These horses, lee-gee. I know I have said and done many things in the past weeks that I now see were, at best, misguided and, at worst, a betrayal. Of you, of my calling... of my family. I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. And believe me when I tell you that God works in mysterious ways, higher ways. He still does miracles. They don't always look like what we expect. But if we open our eyes, we open our hearts... they're all around us. Enjoy the party, and God bless you all. Come here for a second, come here. Thank you. What, what happened? Listen, listen, listen. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. You don't have... no, you don't have to apologize. You're here, that's all that matters. I love you. I love you. I missed you so much! Okay, buddy. You ready for this? Come on, let's go! Yay! Are we ready? Oh man, I can't believe it's here already. I am so ready for this. How about you, John? Yeah, I'm ready. Well, I'm glad you're the first. It's right. Come on. Oh my goodness, you look great! Oh man. Oh, I have missed seeing you, sweet Adeline. Yeah, what do you think, buddy? He wants to touch her. You want to touch her? Go ahead, pet her neck, go on. Should we take her for a ride? Let's do it. - Yeah? - Yeah. You want to go up? Ready? One, two, three. Oh man, thanks, Daddy. Why don't we go have some coffee? Okay. You good? Yeah. - Love you. - Love you, too. Adeline.
