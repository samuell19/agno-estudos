Right... I have a secret to tell you. You're in the middle the road... I know... Want to hear it? Want to move the car first? - Actually, no. Just want to tell you more something. What? This will not succeed... Okay, tell me. I'm in love with you... Let the children walk with nature... They see the beautiful ties and communions... ...between life and death... The joyous inseparable unity... And learn that death is indeed, required... And as beautiful as life. That's my hope for Bennett. This young amazing... ...we were caught so suddenly... ...that was so beloved, surrounded by all that beautiful thought. It is with this state of mind we returned Bennett... ...to that kingdom where God miraculously created life. Open the door, Ryan. - One moment. Me... Me... Come on, let me enter. Creed, Ryan. Open those windows. I do not care what you say, next time, let Gloria help you. It looks like something died and went to heaven. I did not know she was here. - It is not. But she will return very soon. Where were you? - I was here. What? At home? - Yes.. Give the guys once in a while, yeah? His mother is worried. What I want to know, I need to know... is... How were the 17 minutes of life for my child? I do not know what to say, Mrs. Brewer, I was not there... She talked to every doctor, each nurse, each paramedic each firefighter... ...who worked on that night. I do not know what information I can give you further. Jordan and Walker? - It's still in a coma. I know, but I have a video a surveillance camera... ...and in this video looks like they talked... ...might have talked. He would have been able to talk to my son? This depends on the slow bleeding in his brain. It is possible that he become conscious... ...enough hold a conversation. Then he would have been the last person talking to my son before he dies? Yes. Sorry, I have an appointment. When he thinks will wake up? As I said before, Ms. Brewer, already gave you all the answers I knew. But he could wake up and say, what are the signs? Sorry. Allen? Allen? Hi. Hi, how are you? Sorry. I'm a little tired... You're sweating. Yes.. Yes.. Thank you. You're right. These figures are correct? For there I have nothing here for the summer. Allen? - Okay. It seems you forgot to sleep. I'm fine. Okay. Thanks for the flowers, not needed... So many times I wanted to call you, did not know what to do in this situation. Just want to be strong for Grace is everything. That's what I'm doing. Sure... So... We... We have 30 students here. Ready and praying to form. Well, I'll see what I can do. If you want something, anything, just tell me. I know. Today I had an idea interesting. I even made a purchase. There seems to be much research on to mourn the death of someone. I found some interesting suggestions. No, Allen, no... Suggest that we use a bell. We can play it when Bennett to miss... Or... when we think of it. You can put it anywhere in the house. Let me see it. Hello - Oi... Is the Rose, right? - Yes. Come in. Here... Want a tea, a soda? No, I'm fine, thanks. Sorry that I spend here. No way. I'm glad you came. I've been wanting to talk to you since the funeral. Yes, I know. I wish I could have given more answers to his wife. I know how much she wanted them. She certainly wants answers. You are very focused on that subject. But it's just a matter of time. How are you feeling? Water... Can you give me some water? Yes, of course. Sit there and feel free. I've been trying to imagine how you met Bennett. You are part of the government Huston? No... Then you must be a trainee in the newspaper? No... Community service? Tell me if I'm hot or cold. Cold. Did not think Bennett kept connect with friends from primary school. No. I'm the one he impregnated. Pardon? - I'm pregnant. Sorry... But... Do not understand. I am three months pregnant. It's Bennett? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. You will have it? He told me just now a night together. I do not believe she has no where to go. It should have a place to stay until the paternity test. Paternity test? Not undergo to this poor girl. You are defending it? - Do not'm defending. Just do not see why she would invent it. Why has 18 years and has no money. I can not handle it. I just can not. Grace, Grace, Grace... Come here... Come here... Not even know this girl. She seems to be a good girl. If it is, after all, I will not be happy with it. I do not want everyone to think we have been blessed. You think we're blessed? - No, I think. Probably it was who painted his hair. He would never do that. Continue making the bed. I'm going down to get it. Why she had to come to our house? We are in mourning, This does not bode well for baby. She should have no other choice. Are you really pregnant? - Yes. This is easy to imagine... The only thing wrong that my brother does, and is not even here to face the consequences. I am the Rose. - I know, I know who you are. My brother had his picture on the bedside table. Is it? - Yes. Not touched because it certainly masturbated with her every night. You are the younger brother? - Yes, high. He did not tell you I'm a freak? No, never told you were high. It was only polite. Are you okay? Yes, I'm alright not seem to be good? Well, it looks kind of rough. I am a little uneasy, yes... You have a fever. I do not know why, I'm feeling good. Ryan... - Yes? My mother has just hospitalized for rehabilitation. Take a gatorade, it helps. What I would say if asked about tonight? How about a compliment so I gave you earlier? Because you gave me nothing. I gave you everything. - Okay, but I want more. Want to know what 're thinking. Please. I'd say... I'd say... The biggest? I like that... I like these words. Somebody help me find my baby. Somebody help me find my baby. I do not know where he went. Have you seen my baby? You can find it? Can not find it... He's so small. I can not... Can not find it. My mother will walk every night at 6. I followed her for two nights. She goes around the block, repeatedly looking for James. Wait a moment. Hi. You must be Ryan. Come in, please. Sit. We just finished with Leighton... Feel free to listen or to participate at any time. Okay. - Sorry, Leighton. When I asked my father where she was, said he was looking for James. Sometimes she runs his room and opens the door... ...like to see it the computer or something. Often, parents who do not saw the body, like her mother, still searching for their children in crowds. Sometimes even think they see them. It's normal, Leighton. The best you can do for your mother... ...is to talk about it with her. I think I can help. And then Ryan. Hi. - Oi... What brings you here? - Nothing. Just thought I'd the normal thing to do. You are experiencing some symptom of loss? No. Who came to see the lady? - Jordan Walker. Do not know why they do not understand this. He prefers the curtains open during the day. Really? He told you that after ordering the aquarium there? He just wanted a little life this room. Decaf Coffee, macchiato flavor caramel and extra foam. Here's to me. If you're trying to bribe me... ...to feed the fish on weekends, give up. Okay. I'll be here over the weekend. Thanks. - Sure. And Tony could ask Dr. Jacobs to move here when you arrive? I have some questions for him. - Instantly... Thank you. Not have to talk, if you want. You can just listen. I strongly recommend I do not share. These people are like vultures of grief. So why do you here? I've got nowhere to go. And my sister Amy burst brains at the church. Sorry. - What about you? My brother... died in a car accident. There are lots of car accidents here. Leighton's brother was in a car, that of the Sarah and Jason... The sister of Hilary had an overdose, e... Jeremy's brother died even before he was born. He is the most dramatic here. Looks as if he remembers him. So is the one with suicide? - How to know it was not murder? Because you just said she blew his brains out. It's just suicide... Nothing special. You know... It is not easy, or... more interesting. All the different layers the problems of fucked. I'm fine. I'm doing fine, really. Well, if not, the group is great to talk about it. Your friends will avoid you like the plague. Not talk about it with them. So I'm glad you are here. Did you ever notice me, in times when we crossed? At least recognize me, at some point? Keep your eyes closed. I'm almost done. The two are closed. Are closed. - Great. So, you were elected 'Most Popular' or 'the best of all,' or 'the best guy to know,' right? Right... Yes, I was elected the best of all. So you're a nice guy? I think so. That's why we're here? Why is cool with everyone? No... You do not seem more the king of the dance. What the fuck. My mother will kill me. I thought it went down well. Really? - Yes. Yes? - Yes. You're so beautiful, Rose. Tell us if there is something who can not eat. I wonder how your stomach should be sensitive now. I desire to eat Taco Bell burritos. Peanut butter and bananas was that of Grace, right? Right. When Grace had Ryan, thought I would give birth to a Banana Split. Actually, it was Bennett. Bryan is enjoying the summer? Summer is over. Right. Tell me why. I can not remember. Okay. Here's another. How's school? Goes well. I have every classes they wanted... After school, I and the guys went swimming... ...and perhaps later we go to the movies. Excellent. - Why is it great? Seems like a good way to spend the day. All that's missing a bean burrito. Got something to Rose. - Great. Let's see what it is. Has a website where do i put a picture of two people... ...and sees himself as would their children. I put your picture and that of Bennett, and according to them, the son of you... ...goes to school the weirdos on the bus. Ryan, this is not appropriate. Let me see. Look. Look. At least, establishing the his standards very well, right? Enough is enough, Ryan. Thank you. Still I love him. Does anyone know if the time will improve over the weekend? Why do it? Why does it always changes the subject when it comes to Bennett. I do not do that. - Yes, you do. Grace... - You do. What? You painted the hair Our son of blue? Rose did not want to talk about it at dinner. Why not? I just want to know. - Grace, come on. Why fuss now? I'm just asking a question. You painted blue or not our son's hair? Finished. Yes. You know, when I went to the morgue, I thought it was him... I thought it was another, because our son never painted his hair blue. And I thought maybe there was a mistake, and then... I saw his face e... ...he was, was our son. And he was dead... again. It was as if he had died twice. Sorry. I did not want to create case just wanted to ask a question. Can I come in time attendance, if it is easier. No, no, do not do this, Dante. Iets start from the beginning. I will return tomorrow. I'll make an appointment. I'm fine... I'm fine. Maybe you should think about take more time to leave. Can I get a replacement. No, do not. I'm fine. It's just that I have not yet my breakfast. Have dinner with me tonight? Without conditions... We used to be good friends... Remember? I... just need a night of sleep... That's my problem, need a night's sleep. And the beach house? It's certainly a wonderful place... ...to forget the world awhile. Grace loves the beach house. Right. Well.. When the mother of Rick died, I took the whole family to Florida a few weeks, made a difference... I can no longer talk to you. You know that. I just want to make sure that you're taking care of yourself. It was not always Grace. Ryan, go to the beach house. - When? I do not want to hear anything, the decision was taken, the whole family goes. Only when asked. Now, today. Can I bring someone? - Yes, of course. Who? Ashley. - Okay. No drugs. - Please, Daddy, why not? I'm serious, Ryan. Go help his mother to pack. Think you'll want a sample before we go? Please, Grace, disconnect it. I do not understand how the car shatters so. Maybe we should show Bill again, because... Maybe there was something wrong with the structure of the car. There was. He exits the truck, goes to Bennett and then... It seems that talks to him... Grace. Ryan has a sample would love to test. talks to him and gives his coat to him... Will test the sample or not? He stayed alive for 17 minutes. It has no curiosity... ...about what happened in those 17 minutes? Perhaps this is a good time to to stop the tests, you know? Ryan looks good... We're not going to push. What do you think? I think it's important be consistent. That's right. I was just thinking this is too much. It's okay, I'm alright I can do it. You did not lead the beach house, it took? Of course not. This music is wonderful. Has anyone ever made love the sound of this song? Mom already did... She is laughing. I'm sitting on his bed? - Yes. It's creepy. You two get along? We fought a little when we were little, Mom says I always followed him. He was so cute. My mom thinks it was the thing Incredible as ever lived, but... In fact, he knew to be a child's mother when he wanted. He won a lot of gadgets. It... He won. You would probably want courting him. No. - Yes, you would want. Believe me. He had that effect on people. I know my mother wanted courting him at times. What about you? - As for me, what? Who would you date? I do not know... You, perhaps? Maybe... I will win. Arrive first down there. Here we go. Hi, Grace. Got a minute? - Sure. I bought a book. A book about babies. And there are so many questions I do not know the answers. And then I expect you help me complete it. Not a good time? - Okay. What do you need? His name... As you Bennett chose the name? Because of Tony Bennett. - Singer? It is not easy to choose the name our baby. Allen and I did not agree as the name for a girl. Ruby and I wanted it something more traditional. Ruby... It's beautiful. So... I hope this helps you. Want to feel? Why do not you swim like the others? He always kicks me out, when listening to your voice... Feel. I'm fine, thanks. - Please... It's strong. Again. I never imagined that would become pregnant. Neither thought it was possible the first time. Who has that kind of luck? Do you think that was the first time Bennett? Yes, I think so. Funny, is not, you are the one to talk to me about it? I love to talk, most of all, I have so many questions. I think you should go swimming. I 'Bennett. - Nice to meet you, Bennett. Nice to meet you too. Right... - Wait. What college are you going? - The Barnard. And you? I thought it was New York. No, I go to Barnard, gave me scholarship. Beauty. I go to Berkeley. Without scholarship. Gotta go to work. I'm always late. You are right... Please do not go. It took me a year to take courage to speak with you. Do not go, please. You waited until 3:15 the last day of school. Right... I never said I was good to choose the moment. Gotta go to work. Do I... I go with you? - Yes. Sorry... - Yes.. Yes? Are you sure? Ryan. Ryan. Ryan. Ryan. Here comes a storm. Exit the water. What? - Do not question me. Just get out of the water. Now. I can swim. Damn. Get out now. Right now. And I'm serious. You understand me? Please come. Damn. Get out now. What are you doing? - Do not want to hear from you. Listen to me. Did you swim? Yes, yes... Yes, I swam. It was... well, it was good. Was a little cold, but it was good. Are you okay? Ah, yes, I'm cool. I'm fine. Just fine. There's nothing like a breeze the ocean, you know? I know... I always wanted live near the ocean. My mother thought I was almost a freak. But that thing. - It makes no sense. No, not really. His mother is more than welcome to be with us if she wants. Would not work. My mother it is not very healthy... I do not think it would scare someone in our house. The truth is not told her I'm pregnant. Why not? Because she chose to tell me that the wrong way. Do not want to hear it... I do not think you have chosen the wrong way. I'm not sure why the chose, but do not regret what he did. I know there's other options. - We would support either. I am not against any of them. - Of course not. I just... I do not know. - Do not you know? No, I really know... - You do not know. You do not know. It's okay. We can talk about that another time. We go to the cinema? Ryan. Allen? Want to see my trick I do at parties? Sure. - Okay. Hold it. Look at that. Good. Actually I never did it at a party. I do not know how I walked away with it. Is there any trick to do at parties? Do not know if this counts, but never forget the numbers of people. I tend to memorize numbers. What are my numbers? You have 18 years, 216 months... ...164 weeks, 25,920 days... ...311,040 hours. You have arrived at our door... ...in... August 14, 2008, at 2:30 pm, his delivery is planned for February 12, 2009. Still remaining over 119 days... ...2136 hours... ...128,160 minutes. And you have two heartbeats. As far as I know is you, tell you more. This trick for your party is so much better. What happened? Where is Grace? - She's fine. There in the back. - And my son? Upstairs. - What happened? His wife fell ill in supermarket and needed assistance. She's out there? - Yes. Thank you, officer. This is Rose. Are you okay? I called a cab. - Why do not you call me? Because your phone was off. Sorry... I was at the movies. Have you been to the movies? - Yes, with Rose. It was nice to get out a bit. Why did you shut down your phone? Were only two hours. Anything can happen in two hours. What happened at the supermarket? It was a funny movie? Did you laugh? That was sad, you cry? I can not stand it. I warn you... You do not... I just want to know what happened. That's it. I had an idea... If you want, go to Paris with Rose, or Rome, or somewhere very romantic, take a holiday from all this... death. That's not fair. Know what is fair? It's not fair that you can go to the movies with her, and I can not pass through the grain Bennett's favorite... Please... Do not do it... Do not do it... Sorry. God. God. God. God. Where are you going? No. No. Sorry. Sorry. Come here... Sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry... Sorry. Sorry. So sorry. So sorry. I really am sorry. I love you. I love you. I love you. Grace, love only you, and no one else understands me? Sorry. I am very sorry to be gone for so long. But now I'm back. But how wonderful. Look. Can not even follow the simple instructions. How many times have you told them you need light? Okay, enough already. Let's read. Not even remember where we left off. It was in the 7th or the 8th Chapter. Let's see... Eighth chapter. Let's finish the whole list of readings for the summer, as this is the first. And tell her that the college is more boring than the college. Right. Where were we? Let's see... He began to move a dream... Shivering as the needle gauge when pointed toward the stairs, His squeaky voice, stare... Something seemed to have gone wrong. My... reflections... You know something? Allen... was not always so. I do not want the judge, it is actually a man very nice. And you would see this if he knew. He never loved anyone less than it should, never. I want you to know that. It's just a phase... A phase we are going through, that's all. Exactly like any other. 'What is it?' I stammered softly, e... He is all of you. - What is happening? Wait. What...? - He will be transferred. Where? Why? There is an arrest warrant. Go to the municipal hospital, where there is 24 hour security. There must be a mistake... - There is some mistake. What about his stuff? You will not need them where it is going. You'll be scared if their things have gone. What do you think that a man these will bring to your life? Once you agree, if you wake up... goes straight to Rikers Prison. Go visit him there too? I think Grace is perhaps the having an affair. No. If not the blame. I do not think she would. I did... I had a case. I needed to know she loved me. I am tired. All my life I I felt like it was our 1st meeting. I never deserved. Want to go to a party with me? 'll be fun. I'm not dressed for this. Do not worry. They are not judging people. My God. You're great. Never thought I could stretch so Shea, this is Allen. Allen, this is Shea. Hi, how are you? - Hi Nice to meet you. Wait. Realized that this is the visual... ...with which they would never want be seen at a party, right? No, but I'm wearing clothes pregnant with Grace, then no way. And you? - Yeah. You really are perfect. Let's go. Nor would I want to dead be seen naked. You're pregnant or something? Yes, I am. You live under the viaduct and will have a baby homeless... ...and will use it to get more money? No, I'm just a normal pregnancy. Bring it on. Neither would get me killed having a baby. It's okay if I bring more? If you're good for you I have to tell you a thing. Listen... I'm addicted. I'm traveling and everything else... It's something Britney Spears would say: 'I'm traveling,' take out? We can go somewhere else. No, wait. Wait. Say... ...something familiar, please. Something familiar. I am simply seeing too many ghosts. Potato chips. SpongeBob. Monkeys? The ones that you pull out the balls, drop your birthday cake, or legal? The law. Go, baby, go. What did you do? - They autographed my belly. It seemed cute at the time... 'Have a great summer with the new kid.' Never short annuals. Want to autograph? - Okay. Perhaps it was easier if you talked with Grace about it. Floodgates... Do not know what to do if they were opened. I'll talk about someone. But evil is upon him. Why would you do that? Because there are things I need to tell you. Okay. I met this guy... He was really wonderful to me. Is everything okay? Yes. The first time I saw him, was in English class. He wore a baseball cap on the first day of class. The teacher made him take it off and his hair was all shook up, and he smiled at me while trying to straighten it. We looked each other thereafter. And I began to feel as if he knew. He looked so much your picture in the yearbook I knew your face color. Last year, I had piano lessons. And he, football. Then we were crossing each day after classes exactly the same place. And it became something I waited anxiously. So eagerly I can say every day he missed, because they were the days I was disappointed. And sometimes he looked at me... other times, turning her face... ...And sometimes was so intense... ...we started to look at from the very beginning of the steps. And then the last day, He spoke to me. And everything he told me was exactly as I imagined it would. And he felt like he felt in my dreams, and thought that everything happened exactly... ...the way it should happen. And I was happy as ever was. Happy and fearful the same time. And if he saw my belly, would have written something comforting. This was one of the hardest things already decided. It took me three years to do so. And I was in love for it... That's why we'll stay with the baby. I was in love with him for four years. I hardly knew him... But everything was exactly as pictured... Everything was... exactly as I visualized. I had to stay with this baby. I think it was love of my life. I am very tired... I can not keep fighting. So tired... It was a good story. - Thanks. I did not mean in that sense, I say, it was good to hear. Not for you, but for me it was, I think. So how was the funeral your brother? I do not remember. - Faulty memory? No, not really remember, I was very high. Did not know you are drugged... I do not crank. My mom tests me every two weeks. That's what they do to prove my life is normal. Need company? - Yes, of course. The baby is upside down, which means it is almost time. How are you feeling, Mr. Brewer? Looks like you need rest. I'm fine, thanks. How's the baby? Just as I want she is now. It's a girl? - Sorry, I thought you knew. It's a girl? - Congratulations. She is healthy? It is stronger than the Her heartbeat. Took good care of her. This is wonderful. This is wonderful. Excuse me. It's wonderful. Okay, be right back. Well done. What is your problem? - Only need 1 minute. So... Take a minute. I'll go back inside. I do not want this baby, Allen, and not care if it sounds horrible. That sounds horrible. If he were alive, she would not be with the baby. I can be her friend. - There needs to be. Do not be. - No, no, do nothing. I do not care anymore. Can not tell how am I feeling? Not when everything you say sounds so terrible. You're right. Losing a child is terrible. You are not the owner of suffering. It is not the only one who knows suffering. Other people suffer. You do not. Not shed a tear, not once. I'll enter. - ... Go to sporting events Someone has to remain strong, stay long. If I collapse, everything goes to hell and not allow it. Sorry if I can not cope with nothing but my pain... ...and not treat the family as an army. Not everything is about you or her pain, Grace. There are people in our lives that need our attention. They do not give a puppy who has just losing a dog. You do not do that. So what do we do? We returned it? We give her 20 bucks and wish him luck? Treat it as a gift given to us, as if everything good that our son died, that does not soften the blow. For me, yes. I'm happy for you. I'm glad... ...the girl is the reason for our son dead soften the blow for you. It's not fair... What was he doing in the middle of the road? If you were with friends, if you were with us, would be on the road? Answer me. You know nothing about it. It made no effort to meet her. Do not want to get to know her, does not understand this? Should have been her to die that night. Should have been it. Hello..? Oi - Can I help you? Yes Ashley made this scarf in my car. Who are you? I'm Amy. I live here. Amy? - Yes. Amy, the older sister Ashley? What she told you? I had died electrocuted? I fell into the sea during a cruise? What did she say this time? - Ryan. I'll tell Mom. - I hate you. Ryan. Ryan, please, I can explain. Ryan, listen to me, please. They do not mind me. For them, I could be dead. No idea what this is. - Yes, do. Sorry. Sorry. You're a liar. Is that what you are. Look... This is not so bad. You have no idea how it is. Say. Say no idea how it is. No idea. Open the gate. Open the fucking door. Desculpe. S? wanted You like me. Fuck you. Hello. Hello. What did you do? - I called Gloria. You said you do not speak about it. We could not live with the house that way. Come on, please. Wait. Wait. Wait. What is this? You washed the shirts of him? 're Fired. Sorry... - Stop. You deleted... What did you do? Is acting as a child. I did not do anything about this. I enjoyed looking at pictures of him and smell you. And now everything is gone. - He's here. No, he's not here. He's dead. I know it, damn it. We have nothing else to which we cling, do not you understand? What is your problem? You can not just... Sorry. Oh, my God. Ms. Brewer... He had all the symptoms of a heart attack: difficulty breathing... tightness in the chest... ...changes in heartbeat heart... dizziness... But it was not a heart attack? - We can not say that. The electrocardiogram is normal. - What? His body is under tremendous stress, Ms. Brewer. High blood pressure... sinusitis reflected an ear infection... And he suffers from a severe lack of sleep. But it was a heart attack? Sometimes patients manifest symptoms... ...because it is easier to feel physical pain than emotional. Ryan. I was not waiting. Can I share something? My... my story, or whatever that is what you do here. Yes, of course. - Where do I start? Wherever you start? - Start where you like. I can say that my brother was a jerk? You can say anything you want. My brother was a jerk, right? And now that he died, is a drug of martyr. In fact, he's dead, right? He had the chance to see the body? No, I was too drugged. My mom picked me up and could not move, or moved her head. Then I could not say goodbye. I was just lying in bed... ...thinking about all the attention he would have back home... ...and how your dumb friends sign the plaster... And as he probably still win a shag out of pity. So I did not say goodbye. And now... You know? Turns out... Turns out... he... He was never a jerk. In fact, he was very nice to me. He could have snitched me a thousand times... ...and never did. He and I used to do all kinds of crap together. The truth is that I want to be exactly like him. I love him more than anything. And I was too drugged to say goodbye. And I believe that everything I gave him... ...was nothing. You know what it is to have only one chance... ...and throw it away? Was up. I will never have this chance again. Miss him so much. Hello, Mrs. Brewer. - You woke up. Yesterday morning. Do not called me. Is he okay? - Looks good. Will be transferred to prison from Rikers in 10 minutes. Can I talk to him? - Make it quick. Hello I am Grace... Brewer. Bennett's mother. The boy in the car? So what? So what if you were the last person to see my son alive. The signal was green for me. I'll sue your family. Do you remember? Are you feeling better? - I seem to be feeling better? I saw the video surveillance camera... And it seems that you spoke with my son... As if to comfort after the accident... Not comfort anyone. If you have not noticed, I have other shit in the head. Remember if he was pain? I will not do that, ma'am. I waited a long time to talk to you. Please. Go away. Get out. Skirt. - I can not. I can not. He did not die as a hero, if this is what want to hear. Not so. I do not know... Happened. It happened quickly. He asked me if it was his fault. - And then you told him that was not it? I told him not to worry. - What else? You want to know, ma'am? - More than anything. His body was trapped between the front of my truck... ...and his door. There was so much metal crushed... I do not know. Perhaps this that kept whole. Did not want to move it. I think not could, if I tried. The right arm was so behind the body... ...it seemed that neither was more attached to the shoulder. Never seen anything like it. I had to climb to the roof of my truck just to get to him. I do not think he was in pain. Just think... he was cold. And then you gave him your coat? Yes, but that does not avail. It was o... blood... The blood did feel cold. How much blood? How much? More than I ever had seen. He was terrified? I do not know, I mean, there were... ...fluids everywhere, but... A lot of parts out of it, you know? Maybe it... Perhaps he was crying, I guess. He was crying because I was with pain or because he was scared? Does it matter? - Which one was it? Terrified, I suppose. Think he knew dying? He knew he was dying? He knew he was evil, but not we speak of God or something. I just told you listen to the sirens, when they hear the sirens, everything would be fine. He needed me and I was not there... I should be there to ensure he had no fear. Want some water? He needed me, called me, and I was not there... He did not call for the lady. He called for it, repeatedly, the girl who was in his car. Rose? - Rose. Only cared about Rose. If you were injured, it was with pain, he wondered why... Was telling me: 'You have to help her, has to take care of it.' But I... thought she was dead. Rose wondered why? Even asked me to increase the radio volume... That poor boy had blood leaving the ears... ...and wanted her to hear the music was playing. He thought that perhaps she liked to hear it. Gotta go. Relax. You can stay here by the time you want. And Rose, I called my mother about the former correctional institutions it. This is almost nothing, I swear. Hi. Is Lydia? Yes, hi. Here is Shea, I am a friend of Rose's work. Rose is quite good and she I want to tell you something... that... Right. Well, not take much of their time, then... I did not know... She lost her job. And only 15 minutes on the phone. I am very sorry to hear that, But... Rose wants I tell you one thing. What is... she is pregnant. I'd say 3 or 4 months... Yes.. She will stay with him. Take care of it for one year. Yes.. She is dealing with this as a true Republican. She wants you to know who is not afraid... ...and that is having the support Family baby's father. I do not know... Imagine everything she needs... Right. She wants to ask you something. Tell him all right, if she wants to come here. Tell him that's fine. - Are you sure? Yes. What? She wants you to ask $ 10,000 early... ...and says it will help you if you get the 10000 now. Because... she thinks this is what you need. It seemed that she was happy to know that you were okay. Okay. The doctor said you can go. Yes.. - Great. You spoke with Jordan Walker, is not it? Yes. What did you learn? Bennett loved her, did not you? Oh, yes... I wish he had called for me. This is so horrible? I call for you... Call for you every day. I am here now... - Oh, my God. I want my son. My poor, poor, poor child. Okay... It's okay... I was not there when he most needed me. I could not... I could not save him. I could not save him. I could not save him. - Look at me. Allen. It was a mistake. It was a mistake. He died on impact, he did not suffer. You could not have done anything. He did not suffer. There was no suffering. There was nothing you could do. It's okay... We have to take it to our house. We have to do it. All places where she could have gone. I'll look for it. - Sure. Okay? - I'm ready. I'm fine. Come on. Hello. I'm Allen Brewer. Wow. You really could so drop dead handsome. I am looking for Rose. - You lost? No way. - I do not know where she is. I would love to find it. We are worried, then Please tell us something... Please. It's about time. Try the place of the accident. She goes there every afternoon. Rose. Rose. Wait. Do not worry. The baby is fine. Rose... We were worried, right? Why? Why bother me? Why look in the yearbooks to find the father of my baby? I go. - Do not go see it. The most disgusting thing I've ever seen just out of my body on the bus. Is in labor? I'm fine. You did a nice progress in a year, Rose. We were worried about you. You disappeared. Do not worry, this baby will be fine. Let's take her to hospital. If very early, we took you home. I do not want to go home. I do not want my daughter growing up in a dysfunctional home. How will I create it without talk about her father? Tell her not to mention your name in front of the grandfather... ...because they did not accept he is dead? Or be worried that the grandmother to choke while she sleeps, because they would prefer it did not exist? Or that her uncle let samples urine in her crib? Sorry, that was not fair... I like you, Ryan. I like you too. - Thanks. I promise not to suffocate in her crib. I know that I was not very helpful for you in your situation... And if I had to do it all again, would entirely different. Rose... When you have your baby, you will understand... ...that the most horrible thing that can happen to a parent is losing a child. I am very sorry... ...what happened between us. I really regret. Please, Rose... Give us a chance... Get in the car with us. Do not even know who he is... The want to know? We will tell you... I want to know everything know if he were still alive. I want more memories of him. We will tell all you want to know, let's talk until the baby is born. There is a picture of him on the track athletics. He was fast? My baby will be fast? - Yes. - How fast? - 400 meters in 15 seconds. Okay... Okay... He was voted 'best of all.' Why everyone liked him so much? Tell me. Because he was a nice guy... In the third year... ...when his friend Jack wore glasses, Bennett felt so bad for him, which caught the eye of Allen... ...and took them to school the next day that Jack was not the only one. Who is this girl with him? It was the pair of them at the ball and it was only... ...with her because she drank a lot. Ryan. - It's true. That's good. I liked it, that's information. It was a very smart girl. He studied English Literature at Oxford. It was good to drink. What else? What else? I hated that take pictures of it. When they took his picture, made a horrible grimace. What face? It's kinda hard... - Show me the face. It's horrible. He ate what was on the plate, since that was all apart. Took the pizza topping and ate everything in order... He was kind of weird... - But in a very bland. When eating Cheetos, ate them in pairs... ...lest stay alone. My God, this hurts. I used it twat all the time. He never used dental floss, but used a bit of cologne... One who found in the closet of his father, and stayed with his smell. It's happening. Bennett has lived 17 years, 3 months, 7 days... ...2 hours and 36 minutes. He broke six bones in life. Took 3.97 GPA and has never had a girlfriend before I met you. Its higher temperature was 40 degrees. E... I knew from before speak their first word. And what was it? Mom. - Mom. Thank you. Thank you. Keep breathing. It's okay, honey. Squeeze my hand if you want. Keep breathing... We soon arrive. Her name is Ruby. Hey. Hi. - Hi.
