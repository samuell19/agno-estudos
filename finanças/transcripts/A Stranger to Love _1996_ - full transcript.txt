(rain pattering) (laughter) Hi. (voices) Hi. Oh, sorry we're late. Got to go, Paul. I will see you later. Tell your Dad I still make better pesto than he does, but I'll wait up for him, anyway. Bye, Mom. I wanna ask Dad something. Make it fast, Chris. He's busy. (voices) ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow... ♪ Okay, people, we've got five, seven, and 15 ready to go. I need two mixed greens and a cold seafood on 10. Mixed greens. Gold seafood. Crab cakes, asparagus, red pepper soup on 12. Crab cakes, asparagus, red pepper soup. Three ducks in the oven for two. Let me have those veal chops for Mr. and Mrs. Morgan. Don't they ever eat anything else? As my father used to say, as long as they eat it here, Al. There he is. Hi, Dad. Just the man I wanted to see. Come over here and taste this-- I don't know if it's good or not. Now, this is hot. Do it fast... I know. Okay. So? It's good. We can serve it! Let's go, Chris. Come on, Mom's waiting. Can I pitch to you tomorrow? Yeah, come by tomorrow after lunch. We'll work on your curve. Hey-- give me a little hug? See ya, Dad. Love ya. (silent) See you later. You can't pick up the check for six people, Dad. It's the wrong way to make a profit. It's okay, Paul. No, it's $300. It's good business. It's how you go out of business. That's Bob Hanley, of Hanley, Osborn, and Greer. One of the biggest law firms in Omaha. He's 52 today. The other guys are Osborn and Greer. They've been regulars for years. Off hand, I'd say they put you through school. You take care of this. Okay? I'll be right back. Where are you going? Hawaii. Evening. Hey, Allan. Thanks. You know, Steve is due for a raise. And I think we need a new compressor for the walk-in. That's a lot of money, Dad. So what are you going to do? I'm gonna wish Bob Hanley a Happy Birthday, buy anyone who has to wait for their food a drink, and then I'm gonna go back into the kitchen and do what I've done every night for the last 24 years. You can't run a restaurant like this. You'd do it different if you owned it? As a matter of fact, I would. (sighs) (brakes squeak) Hello. Hi. What time is it? (groans) ...2:30. Oh. It was a late night. You should have called me, I would have come back to the restaurant and kept you company. I know. New schedules? Mmm, busy work for Meals On Wheels. I really stayed up to talk to you. (sighs) Hungry? Mmm. Oh, come on. (groans) What's the matter? Well, he's got a degree in restaurant management for all of two months, and he thinks he knows more about running the place than I do. He's just trying to impress you. (laughs) ...Hanley's birthday, and he doesn't want me to pick up the check. This isn't about Paul. I've been doing the same thing for 24 years, Linda. 14 at my father's restaurant, ten at my place. It's the only thing I've ever done since the day I graduated from high school. It's the only thing you've ever wanted to do. To own your own place, to raise a family. That's what's important to you. Is what we have... all you've ever wanted? Yes, it's a lot. No, no, no, no, it's not about you. It's not about us. It's about me. Well then, talk to me. Tell me what you're feeling. Nothing, empty. I don't know. I... What can I do? How can I help? I love you so much. I know that! It's... it's just... I'm going to get some more milk. I'll be right back. Okay? (thunder rumbling) Give me the damn keys! Get your hands off me! Stop movin', you! (engine starts) (overlapping chatter) The vehicle was found abandoned in the immediate vicinity of a convenience store robbery. There was blood in the back. It was O-positive. In Dallas? Bob, I don't understand. Well, Linda, it's possible that whoever took Allan's car two weeks ago drove to Dallas, did the robbery, and then went out and found himself another car. That's not an unusual scenario for grand theft auto. But O-positive's very common, right? You can't be sure it was my Dad's blood. No, no, that's why Detective Romero and his team are running a continuing check on every hotel, hospital, and jail in the state. We're also checking local train and bus stations and all the area airports. But so far... We need to start checking the morgues. And although we can't be certain that's Allan's blood, evidence indicates that we're gonna have to start walking down that side of the street if we're going to eliminate foul play as a possibility. And we're going to start compiling a list of all the unidentified bodies around the state. The computer will, uh, narrow the list down to reasonable matches, and then... And then? And then you'll have to visually I.D. those particular bodies. (sighs) And you'll call us if, uh... Absolutely. I have to get back to the restaurant. Thank you. (phone ringing) Coffee? He wouldn't have just run away. That's not Allan. I know that. You know, when I first met Allan, he was still working at his father's restaurant. I was, uh, Detective First Grade. Linda, if there's anything I can do for you... You can find Allan and bring him home. (overlapping chatter) (phones ringing) (birds chirping, cawing) (man) Linda, there's a call for you. (second man) Wasn't sure you'd get it in time. Hello? Linda, it's Bo. There's another body. Where is it? Well, they pulled t out of the rive. It's at the coroner'. Is it him? The cause of death is a single blow or more likely several blows to the head. The time of death is approximately eight weeks ago, which is when Mr. Grant was first reported missing. The age at time of death is late 40s, Mr. Grant was 48. And there's an exact or near match with regard to the following. Height, weight, general physical size and shape, hair color, eye color, hand and foot size... Please... is it Allan? What about fingerprints or dental records? The lower portion of the face, the jaw, mouth and teeth have all been badly broken. But there's a general dental match considering the amount of decomposition and decay. And the fingerprints? We were unable to obtain readable prints. It's been in the river the entire eight weeks. Then you're not sure. The absence of the appendix, the general size and location of a birth mark on the right calf, and the small scar above the left eye are all near or identical circumstantial matches. But you're right, we have no way to positively I.D. the body. Bob tells me you've already done this a number of times. Yes. Well, if you'll follow me... Uh, Linda, why don't we let Paul do this one? Are you certain? Are you certain, Paul? It's my father. Okay, thanks, Marcus. (sobbing) No... oh, God! (sobs) (overlapping chatter) See ya tomorrow! (door opening) Mom? What's the matter? Come in, Chris. Sit down. Uh... you know how we've all been trying to find Daddy. Captain Simpson and the coroner and... well, today, uh... today we found him. He's dead, Chris. (sniffling) Your father's dead. (sobs) Oh... I know, sweetheart. I know. (sobbing) I'm so sorry. We did everything we could. Your father loved you, Chris, very much. And so do I. (man) Have a knife? Hi. My name's Russell. And this is Diane. We haven't seen you here before, so we thought we'd come over and say hello. We thought maybe you... you could use some help. (gasping) How did that happen? I don't know. Do you know where you are? No. You're in Tucson. Arizona? Do you know how you got here? Look, we don't wanna hurt you. We just wanna get you some help. What's your name? I don't know. You don't know your name? No. Just tell us your name, okay, so we can help you. Look, all we wanna know is your name. I don't know. I don't know! All right? I don't know! I can't remember! I can't remember anything! (voice) Bus number 818. You want orange? I know you... I know you. (mother) Just leave him alone. I think you know me. No, don't touch him, please. Just leave us alone. You have to-- You have to help me. We don't know you. But... All right, buddy, that's enough. Why don't you leave these nice people alone and come take a ride with us? No, I know this boy. Let's go, pal. Oh, please, you don't understand. He could help me. We understand. Why don't you talk to us instead? No, no, no, please, He can tell me who I am. I need to talk to him. I haven't done anything wrong. Nobody said you did anything wrong. But what you need to do now-- Yeah? is you need to calm down and come with us. No, I am not coming with you. I need to talk to him-- Okay, pal, now listen carefully. Here's what we're gonna do. (handcuffs rattle) We're gonna take a nice, easy walk over there, we're gonna get in the car. You're hurting me. Have you got that? Yeah. Come on, let's go. You know me, don't you? I know him. (door opens) Hello. I'm Dr. Freedland. You remember me? Have you remembered your name? No. Do you know today's date? Mm-mm, mm-mm. Do you know what year it is? No. Do you... know who the President is? (sighs, chuckles) Do you know where you are? No. You're in Tucson, Arizona. This is the County Mental Hospital. Why am I here? You were at the bus station. You were bothering a 10-year-old boy. Do you remember that? Yes-yes-yes, but I wasn't bothering him. I... I knew him. I think I knew him. Who was he? I'm not sure. But he looked familiar. Yes. Do you smoke? No. How long have I been here? Three days. This is wrong. I don't belong here. That's what you keep saying, but you never tell me where you do belong. I don't know! I told you, I don't know! I can't remember! Is it possible the truth is you don't want to remember? Trust me. Tell me something about yourself. I haven't broken any laws. You can't keep me here against my will. After the initial 72-hour hold, I can order a 14-day stay if I'm not convinced it's safe to release you. When you're ready to relax, we'll talk again, okay? Allan. Excuse me? My name is Allan. And your last name? Grey. Allan Grey. Good. Allan, that's a start. We'll talk again later. (overlapping chatter) (nurse) Hey, you can't do that! Stop! Stop! Stop him! (man) Watch out! (man) Hey! Hey! Dr. Freedland! (alarm rings) (car horn honking) (car horn honking) (car horn honking) (tires screeching) (car horn honking) (man) Move it! (car horn honking) Go! (car horn honking) (pastor) Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Amen. (all) Amen. (soft chatter) Dad's knife. Oh... His grandfather gave him this when he was just a boy. It's really old, huh? Mmm... your dad had this with him on every camping trip we ever went on. You know, Chris, I think he would have wanted you to have it. He wanted you to love camping as much as he did. I wish I could have gone with him one more time. Oh... (giggles) Your dad found this on the very first camping trip we ever made to Mesa Verde. We hadn't been married very long. He said he thought it was an Anasazi arrowhead. Anna-what? Anasazi. They were Indians. Their name means, uh, the Old Ones. And they lived in beautiful cliff dwellings a long, long time ago... Your dad said he thought this arrowhead could bring a family luck. His mitt. Mm-hmm. Who's gonna play catch with me now? I will-- or Paul. You? I'm not so bad for a girl. I'm gonna keep this under my bed. Is that okay? That's fine, sweetheart. Move on. (distant car horn) (distant radio chatter) Okay, let's move along here. Come on, move it. Let's go. Hold it! Hold it! Let's go! (tires screech) (police siren wailing) (horn honking) (police siren wailing) (voice) Final boarding call... Hutchmore? Yeah, 34. All right. Need more, man. (man) All right, thank you. Uh... yes? 30 minutes, ma'am. I, uh... I want to buy a ticket on that bus. Oh, that's not enough, it goes all the way to El Paso. This is all the money I have. Apache Springs is $14.80. That's fine. (register beeps) Hey, your change! (doors hiss) (birds chirping) Hey? Hey, excuse me. Um, excuse me. Don't touch those chairs, please. Listen, you've got to go. Sorry, I didn't mean anything. I just, uh... I understand. I have guests here, all right? So, please, let's move along. It's just I... I don't know where I am. And I thought if I could stay here, uh, I... I... I could, uh... You can't, all right? I'm real sorry about that, but you have to go. Come on, let's move along, let's go. Uh... I wanted to, uh... I know, I understand. Please, just put that down and don't touch anything, and let's go. Please. No, just leave that, it's fine. Just leave it. I'll take care of it. Thank you. Sorry. (sighs) Hey, excuse me. Uh, there's a shelter downtown at the Lutheran Church. They can probably help you there. And have a doctor look at that cut. Thank you. ♪ (doorbell rings) Allan? (laughing) Allan! Oh, my God, it's you. (indistinct chatter) (man) This way, dear. (woman) That was good, huh? (Hanley) Hello, Don. Oh, Bob, hey. Good to see you. You, too. (indistinct chatter) Linda? Don Bradley. I own the Silver Grill over on Harrison. We've met a few times. Oh, of course. Uh, Don, you'll have to forgive me. I'm a little scattered these days. It's okay. I miss him, too. I got to know him pretty well over the years. I considered him a friend. Thank you. That's, uh... sort of why I'm here. You see, I read the story in the newspaper about how he was missing for eight weeks, and then the river and everything. And... Well, I was just in Tucson. I had some business there. Now, I know this is gonna sound crazy, and I probably shouldn't be here. But I swear to you, I'm sure that I saw Allan. Alive, running right across the street. He didn't look well, and he was, uh, thin and dirty. But it was him. I'm sure it was. (stifles a sob) I'm sorry. I knew this was a mistake. Look, I'm really sorry. I don't know what else to say. Did you... Did you speak to him? No. No, there was too much traffic. He was in the middle of the street. I nearly hit him. He looked right at me. Then he was gone. It was him, Linda. It was Allan. (Paul) Mom, please, don't do this. The coroner said there was no positive way to identify the body. That's what he said, Paul. I know, I know. You were upset! The body was decayed. The jaw was broken. You had one quick look. It was Dad. Maybe it wasn't. Maybe you made a mistake. Maybe we buried the wrong man. No, I don't think so. But it's possible. Isn't it, Paul? Isn't it at least possible? Mom... We all miss him. But we have to get on with our lives now. We have to pull ourselves together and move forward as a family. He would have wanted us to. He's alive, Paul. Mom! I felt something... before. I-I-I didn't know what it was. I didn't know how to explain it. But I know what it is now. It's your father, and he is alive. I'm not going to give up, Paul. He would never give up on me. Mom, where are you going? I'm going to Tucson. Will you take care of Chris, hon? Tell him it's a business trip for Meals On Wheels. Mom, wait! (door creaks) (gasps) (paint cans clatter) What are you doing here?! Please, I don't mean any harm. I told you to go to a shelter! I don't belong there. Well, you don't belong here. Come on! Come on, get out! No, please, I don't want to upset you. Is there some... some job? No! Come on, go! Jimmy! (stammering) Now! Come on! Come on. I'll... (indistinct chatter) Hi. Hi. How's everything going? Fine. Good. (boys shouting) Come on, Danny! Whack him! Whack him! (laughs) Jimmy, I asked you not to smoke around the boys. Hey, guys, come here, I need to talk to ya. (boys shouting) Now. Come on, come on. Listen. Now! Okay, there's a homeless guy hangin' around the inn. I caught him sleepin' in the shed. You want me to get rid of him? I'll give him a beatin'. No. He-- He's already gone. I just want you to be careful if you see him, all right? All right? Anyone listening to me?! Hey, what'd this guy look like? Oh, he's got scruffy hair, needs a shave, kind of a sad face. You know, Andi... you know, you can't be too careful. I see this guy come around here again, I'm gonna kick his ... Oh, cool! Yeah! No, no, not cool. There'd be no reason to do that. He hasn't done anything to anyone. He's homeless, that's all. He'll drift away when he's ready. Now, I just want you guys to be careful if you see him. All right? Understand?! Hey, Andi? How about my raise? I know, Jimmy. I said when I can, all right? Soon, right? Soon. (distant siren) (phones ringing, indistinct chatter) (elevator bell dings) I went back four weeks. Not a single Allan Grant is either arrested or detained anywhere in the immediate Tucson vicinity. Did you check the hospitals? No Allan Grants admitted anywhere in that same period of time. Now-- now there is an Allan Grey who was picked up for vagrancy, resisting arrest, and harassment approximately two weeks ago. Now, could he be using a different name? I don't know. What did he look like? Delaney! He was the arresting officer. This is Mrs. Grant. Officer Delaney. Do you remember that vagrant you picked up at the bus station a few weeks ago? Yeah. The one that was talkin' to that kid? Right. What did he look like? Approximately 5'11", unshaven, dirty clothes, dirty hair. He was pretty beat up, between 45 and 55. Is this him? It's possible, but I'd have to say no. It's not the same man. Well, thank you. Oh... what did the little boy look like? 10 or 12 years old, blond hair, blue eyes. Great big blue eyes. Thank you. You're welcome. I wish we could have been more helpful. What happened to him? Who? Allan Grey. Is he still here? Is he under arrest? No, he was brought over to the county mental hospital and released into their custody. He was gone three days later. Well, thank you very much. You're welcome. Sorry. Mm-hmm. A man I know swears he saw him in Tucson. I really don't know what could have happened to him. He was having some sort of mid-life crisis. Maybe he was, uh... disoriented or confused somehow. I know you want to believe Mr. Grey is your husband. But the man who was in our hospital was not experiencing a mid-life crisis. He was, in fact, suffering from some form of severe dissociative trauma, possibly a fugue state, possibly a delirium. I didn't have the opportunity to make a more accurate diagnosis. But it couldn't have been him? This man was hostile and aggressive. Nothing at all like you've described. (sighs) It wasn't him, was it? I'm sorry, but no. It wasn't him. (sobbing) (crickets chirping) (motorcycle revving outside) (motorcycle drives away) Jimmy, are you there? Jimmy? Why did I ever hire him? Damn it, Jimmy! Oh, I can't do this anymore! I've told him a hundred times not to leave early. But does he listen? Nobody listens to me around here except me. I hear everything I say. I'm actually a very good listener. All right, come out of there. Come on, get out of there! I'm not foolin' around. Now! (bangs dumpster) All right, I'm callin' the police. No, wait, please don't! Oof! (panting) No, wait, please. (sighs) Oh, God. Please? I'm hungry. I'll work. I'll wash floors, dishes, anything. Please? Okay. All right, what you're gonna need to do is you're gonna need to bag all the leftovers. And then you put them in the refrigerator down there. All right? And then, you're gonna need to wash these pots and pans by hand. Uh, all the dirty dishes go in here. Now, have you ever run a dishwasher before? Yes. One of these? I think so. Good. Okay. Uh, then you should wipe down the stove and the counters and sweep the floors. Oh, yeah, the garbage bags are back here with all the cleaning stuff. And the garbage, um... I think you know where the garage goes. (chuckles) Yes, I do. (laughing) Um, I have some extra clothes upstairs that... that, um, I was thinking might fit you. So, I'm gonna bring them down, and I'll put them in the back bathroom here. And after you're done with everything, you could take a shower and try 'em on. And then I'll-- I'll get you something to eat, okay? Does that sound fair? Yes. Good. Okay. Uh... what should I call you? Oh. Uh, why don't you call me Andi. Okay. Thank you, Andi. You're welcome. What should I call you? Allan. Okay. So, I'll check on you later, Allan. All right? (swinging door shuts) ♪ (sighs) Oh, man. I must be in the wrong kitchen. Is it okay? Thanks, uh, for loaning me the clothes. Oh, sure. So, uh, you still hungry? Okay. (overlapping chatter) (laughter and chatter) I just can't believe that you offered him a job, just like that. Neither can I. I mean, who is he? Where's he from? I don't know. He wouldn't talk about his past. And he asked me not to ask him about it. Ooh, Mr. Mysterious. Maybe he's runnin' from the law. No, no. Witness Protection Program. You know, where they give you a whole new identity, then they ship you off someplace where nobody knows who you are. No, I got it. He's hidin' from his wife. Or-- or he's a CIA agent. Ooh, and a cute CIA agent, isn't he? All right, all right. Well, don't tell me that you haven't noticed. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sure, but... I don't know. I'm not gonna be a cook forever. Forget about it. Bad hours, heavy lifting. No way. You know, if life keeps treating me this bad, I could end up like you, Al. Give me a hand, will ya, Jimmy? Hey, how about I'm the cook and you're the help, okay? (running footsteps) (laughter) Hey, Jimmy! Hey, punks! Hey, loser! Huh? Zzzzz! (laughing) What's up, gentlemen? Okay, I want a turkey club. How about you, Dan? Cheeseburger. Okay, turkey club and a cheeseburger. Now, Allan. Excuse me, I said now. Not today, guys. Today we use the magic word. Hey, the magic word is hurry up. Yeah, hurry up. We're hungry. No, that doesn't sound right. No, you guys are gonna make your own lunch. Hey, my mom owns this place, Allan. I could have you fired. Well go ahead, Justin. Tell your mom that you ordered me to make you lunch like you have every day for the last two weeks, but this time I asked you to say "please" because I think it's important for a 12-year-old boy to be polite. And then tell her that because you wouldn't say "please," you want her to fire me. So, go ahead. I'll come along. We'll see what she has to say. Okay, okay. Please. How about you, Danny? Please? Because I didn't think of it before, and neither did you. If he is still alive, the only reason he hasn't tried to reach me is because he can't! He can't remember. He's hurt! There was blood in the back of his car. Maybe he has a head injury. Maybe he's lost his memory. Mrs. Grant, head trauma can cause memory deficit. But to experience the kind of generalized amnesia you're suggesting, the total loss of shot and long-term memor, well... it's extremely rare. And as I've explained, Allan Grey was, in all probability, suffering from a dissociative trauma. Did he have a head injury? Mrs. Grant, we're talking three or four months ago now. Would you check his file, please?! Hold on. I've got the schedules. I'll be right there. Uh, Mrs. Grant, yes. There were lesios on the right sie of the forehed and above the ea. The injuries were closed and healing when he was here. Mrs. Gran? Mrs. Gran? Yes. Yes! Thank you, Dr. Freedland. Thank you very much. Then you just click on a state, and everything there is to know about the state comes up. Hm. Yeah, like what's your favorite state, Allan? I don't know. What's yours? Wyoming. We went to Yellowstone Park once. It was really cool. I like Florida. You like Disney World. So what? You like it, too. (chuckling) Have you ever been there? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Dad took us when he was alive. Ah. You miss your dad? Not as bad as when he first died. Sometimes it's hard to remember him. Mm. Is... your dad still alive, Allan? No. No, he's not. It sucks, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. It's hard for me to remember him now, too. But I think what you have to do is pull yourself together the best you can and move on. Keep living. And what you take with you is all the... the love and strength and kindness that your dad gave you when he was still here. And that's the person he'd want you to be. Whether you can remember him exactly or not. Okay, guys. Time for bed. So, did anybody in here get any homework done? Yeah, Allan helped us. Oh, good. Great, okay. So, let's say good night. Night, Dan. Get it goin'. And then I'll be back to tuck you in. All right. Thanks. See ya tomorrow. (door creaks) Allan, about the boys. I just want you to know how much I appreciate... Ah, it means a lot to me, too, Andi. Thanks. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. Good night. (birds tweeting) (indistinct arguing) (Andi) Yeah, are you quitting? (Jimmy) Yeah, I'm quitting. (Andi) Wait a minute! No, no, I'm not waiting, no! Stop, you can't do this, Jimmy! No-- no notice, no nothing. It's not fair! That's the way life is sometimes. Well, this is about money, right? Bingo. I told you I would give you a raise at the end of the month. You can't wait till then? Yeah, well I got a better offer in town. And guess what? It starts tonight. I am going to have a room full of people in there in a half an hour! What am I suppose to do? I don't know, is that my problem? All right, whatever they're paying you, I'll do better. Okay. I'm listening. Don't do it. Let him go. He can't cook anyway. Yeah, right. Good luck. Great! Now what am I gonna do? Who's gonna cook? Oh! Justin, you know how to run this thing? Yeah. Put on an apron. You're the man till we hire someone else. Danny? You're my first assistant. (Danny) Okay. I'll tell you what to do, you just do it, okay? (Danny) Okay. Allan, what are you doing? Makin' dinner. (Andi) Oh, no. Relax, we can do this. No problem. Uhh, God. Well, let's go, let's go. We got orders comin' through that door any minute. You take care of the dining room, I'll take the kitchen. I hope you know what you're doing. Me, too. Now, that's a great lookin' crew! Let's go! (patrons chattering) (laughter) Lookin' good. Lookin' real good. Okay, people take a minute. Tell me if I can serve this or not. Now, this is very hot. You do it like this. Go. All right! Now, trick is, just a bit of sugar cuts the acidity of the tomatoes, lets the basil come to the front. Now, I'll serve this. You guys make two salads for table ten. How much dressing do they get? Not so much that there's a puddle on the plate. And not so little that they got to search for it. You got it. (adding machine clacking) There they are! How'd it go? Great. Fine. Where you goin'? Bed. Yeah. Oh. Good night. (Justin) See you tomorrow. (giggles) The guys were asleep on their feet. (chuckling) Yeah, they worked hard. I'm proud of them. They did great. So did you.

So, Allan, I want you to take Jimmy's job. I mean, I'm-- I'm offering you Jimmy's job, and-- and I want you to say yes. I mean, I hope that you'll say yes. And... and this isn't just about cooking, it's... it's about the boys. They've really come to like you. And it's also about me. I want you to stay, too. I'm not goin' anywhere, Andi. ♪ Come on, it's gettin' cold. Oh, right. It looks great. What is it? I have no idea. (laughs) (distant shouting and laughter) (Allan) I want you to know the truth. I can't remember who I am, Andi. Can you remember anything? Some things. But it's not like remembering them. It's more like just-- just knowing them, having a sense that they're true. Like what? In the Southwest corner of Colorado, there are these Indian villages, ruins, hundreds of years old. And I know that I've been there. I have another life. It's a good life. I can feel that, even if I can't remember it. I may always be looking for it. I... I don't know where I belong? Wanna know what I think? Mm? I think you belong right here. I don't care who you were. It's who you are now and... who you're going to become from this point on. Hey, Allan! Wanna play? Yeah, come on, Allan, come on! Yeah, we need a pitcher. Be right there. ♪ When Steve and I decided to give up our careers and-- and buy the inn, I thought it was going to be easy. We'd live this nice, quiet life in the country, get out of Chicago. (children shouting) And then Steve died. And it was-- it was like... I feel like my heart just sort of shut down, you know? I didn't think I'd ever feel anything again. And then you fell into my life and saved me. (laughs) No, no, no, no. You saved me. I remember that much. Well, okay, so we saved each other. I don't want to think about the past. Let's think about now. Just you and me. Okay? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, quit that! (Danny) Yeah, none of that, come on! (boys laughing) (sighs) Baseball. Yes, I remember. I said I'd play. Yes, you did. I'm going now. I can see that. (man) All right! Okay, we got two down now! Two down. (continues indistinctly) Make me proud. Hit me one! He's been on life support for two days, and they've been unable to locate any family. And they're sure his name is Allan Grey? Thanks for meeting us. (heart monitor beeping, ventilator hissing) That's the last one, Mom. You can't do this to yourself anymore. You can't chase down every Allan Grey in the state of Arizona. I'm not gonna let you! You have to start your life again. You can volunteer like you used to. You can come and work at the restaurant if you want. But you have to let it go. You have Chris to worry about. (crying) Well, that's why I can't let it go! Well, that's why you have to. I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing it for you and Chris. You need your father. My father's dead. But we're still here. It's time to let him go... okay? (sniffles) (Allan) Hurry up! Come on, come on, hurry up! (laughing) No kissin' while we're asleep. Yeah, try to behave yourselves. All right, wise guys. Yeah, we'll be lookin'. Yeah, I'm gonna go downstairs and see what happens! All right, good night. Good night. (Danny) We'll be lookin'. Yeah, we'll be lookin'. (Danny) We'll watch for you! (Allan, chuckling) I can't believe those guys. They're too much. (chuckling) And Danny's only ten. Ohh, we are in trouble. We? Oh, sorry, I, uh... What? Ah, I-- I, uh... I need to ask you something. What is it? We haven't known each other very long, really. And, uh... "And, uh..." I care for you very much. That's nice. And I'm very attracted to you. That was nice, too. And you said that, uh... that I should think about us. And I have. I may never remember my past. Okay. What's real... is you. I love you, Andi. I love you. ♪ Will you marry me? Yes, I will. (both chuckling) Should, uh, should we tell the boys? Tomorrow. Let's tell them tomorrow. I got plans for you. (giggles) So I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings... (laughing) (overlapping chatter) Hi. Boys back yet? No, they're going to be at the Millers' till after dinner. Oh, don't worry. We'll tell 'em tonight. How about after the wedding, we all jump in the car and go camping somewhere? Ooh, Allan, the boys hate camping. They went with their dad once, and they had the most miserable time. They said they'd never go again. But-- Well you know, actually, my idea of a vacation is going to a beach somewhere. No phones, no kids, no nothin'. Sounds boring. Well, so maybe we never get to the beach. (Hanley) Allan? Allan Grant? Bob Hanley! Omaha! This is incredible. I can't-- I mean, it's you. Allan! You know me? (chuckling) Well, of course I know you. You're Allan Grant. Allan's. I eat at your restaurant four days a week. Here, look. Allan's. This is you, Allan Grant. I know your wife, Linda. Your son's name is Paul. I'm-- I'm Allan Grey. Nice meeting you. Allan? Wait, wait. We all thought you were dead. I mean, it's been... Oh, it's been over six months now, but here you are. No, you must have me confused with somebody else, Mr. Hanley. My name is Allan Grey. Allan Grey? Yeah. Come on, Allan. (chuckling) It's not me. Uh, I mean... I'm not him, really. It must be some strong resemblance. My name... I'm not Allan Grant. Well, it's the most remarkable resemblance I've ever seen. Right down to that bandana you're wearing. All right, Allan Grey, all right. Okay. Nice to meet you. ♪ (patrons chattering) (man) Better get started. (man 2) All right, hold on. (dialer beeping) (line ringing) (man) Allan's. Hello, Allan's. Yes, hello, uh... May I speak to Paul Grant, please? (man) Hold on. Thank you. You want me to filet the salmon? Yeah, go ahead. (Paul) Paul Grant. Hello, this is Paul. Is anyone there? Hello? Who was that? No one. (distant dog barking) I, uh, I spoke to that guy Hanley again. He gave me the phone number for Allan's and, uh... I got that woman's address, too. (sighs) I called the restaurant and I asked for Paul. And, uh... I don't know, I can't explain it. When he came on... I couldn't recognize his voice, but I just knew it. Does that make any sense? Nothing makes any sense. You know, Allan, this all could just be a big mistake. I mean the guy could be wrong. He was so sure, Andi. So sure I was Allan Grant. I have to find out if it's true. So, what are you saying? I can't move on.... without knowing the truth. "The truth." (chuckling) The truth is I love you, Allan. That's the truth. Hey. (children chattering) Are you glad to be working again? Yes, I am. Richie Knight says Meals On Wheels is a really cool thing. Richie Knight is a very smart boy. Can I come with you sometime? Yes, I'd like that. On a school day? (laughs) You were doing very well up until then. Oh, my God. Allan? Oh, my God. (prep cook) No, no, no. You slice against the grain. (Justin) Oh, I get it. You practice that, you'll be as good as me by the end of lunch. Cool. You think so? Mm-hmm. I'm countin' on it. See, the idea is to teach you everything I know, then sit back and let you do all the work. I'll be the Executive Chef. Then what'll I be? Over-worked and under-paid. (laughing) That's right. (Andi) Allan? Yeah? This is Linda Grant. (inhales) (Andi) She got your letter. Hello, Allan. Hello. (crow cawing) She seems nice. Yes. Yes, she, uh... Allan. Look at me. You don't know me? But it's-- it's me. It's Linda. I'm your wife. I know that I-- I know you. I-I can feel that. But I don't remember you. I don't remember us... together. Where are my shoes? (laughs) They were too tight. I got married in my socks? (laughing) Well, everybody at the end of that day was in their socks. We were happy together, weren't we? Yes, we were. We have a good life, Allan. We have a wonderful life. But, to, uh... to tell the truth, before you disappeared, you seemed a little... restless, confused. Confused? About what? I don't know. Maybe you thought you'd lived half your life and you hadn't done all the things you wanted to. We've been together for 24 years, Allan. You're my best friend. My lover. My husband. And I have missed you so much. You know, all I ever wanted to do was spend my life with you and then... you were gone, like that. We buried you. But I never gave up hope... that someday I would find you. And now I have... and I can't bear to let you go again. I can't remember you. I want to, but I... I can't find you in here. I-I... I can't remember. But if you came home with me, then you'd remember. No, I can't. I can't go with you. Why not? Because this is my life now. This is... all I remember. What are you saying, Allan? Andi and I... are getting married. (car door closes, engine starts) Is everything okay? Yeah. (Chris) Does he love them more than us? No. But he can't remember us. How could he not remember us? I don't know. But we can't force him. What if he never does? Then what? Oh, Chris. We can't give up hope. (sighs) Aren't you upset? He's not coming home. Of course I'm upset. (sighs) But at least he's alive, Paul. He is alive. I wanted to be a chef just like Dad. I remember. He tried to teach me. But I wasn't a very good student. If he said left, I said right. If he said up, I said down. That's why I went to school. I wanted to show him that I knew more about restaurants than he did. I wanted to prove that I was right and-- and he was wrong. Well, I was wrong. I was wrong. No. You weren't wrong. And neither was he. It's all part of growing up, part of life. It's a part I want to take back and do over again. I thought he was dead. And now I have a chance to change what happened and he won't let me. He won't come home. I just want him to come home. Me, too. (sighs) Me, too. Chris. Linda. (sobbing) (crickets chirping) What? I looked at the pictures. It's all coming back to me. I don't want to have this conversation. We have to. Why? Because that part of my life is real now. We can't just wish it away. Oh, I can. Well... I can't. Your life is here now. No, I'm just a visitor here. I have a life. I remember it. I miss my family. My wife, my boys. I'm Allan Grant from Omaha. And I want to go home. You made promises to us. I made them out of love. Oh, is that suppose to make this easier for me? No, it makes it harder. For both of us. Oh, it's hard for everyone. Do you think that... that I have never imagined what your wife has been going through? I know what it's like to lose someone you love. When will you be leaving? Tomorrow morning. Well, you'd better talk to the boys before you go. Of course. Why can't you just go visit there and come back? I can't do that, Justin. That's where my life was before I came here. It's important that I go back to it. It's not something that... I can visit. It's not something I can just leave behind. What, and we are? Come here. Listen... You guys, uh... Nothing I could say would make this pain we're feeling go away. None of us... asked for this. I love your mom. I love both of you. But you'll forget all about us. I want you to understand that we're part of each other's lives now. I want to see you grow up. No, you won't. You'll be too far away. You'll never come here. I will. Believe me, I will. Right now, it's just a promise. And all-- all I ask is that you give me a chance. Can we call you sometimes? Sure you can. Yeah. Okay, guys. I think you should go outside. Allan's got to go. We'll be out in a minute. You can be there for the boys, but you can't be there for me. Once you go, you go. I'll be fine. There you go. Thanks. (doorbell rings) Hello, Linda. If, uh... if it's still okay with you... I'm home. Come in. It's funny, I... I didn't think I'd be this nervous. (laughs) It must have been hard for you to leave. It really was. I don't want you here because you feel obligated. I mean, if that's the way you feel, you're free to go back, it's okay. Well, I mean, it's not okay, but it's... You found me. You never gave up. I'm here... because I've loved you all my life. Because I know now I can't live without you. Dad! Hey, guy! Where you goin'? Hi, Paul. Hi. How ya doin'? I'm okay now. What you got there? (Allan) I love you, Paul. Come on, let's work on that curve. ♪
