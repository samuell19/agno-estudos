# The Real McCoy! # HE LAUGHS CROWD CHATTERS CROWD CHATTERS Oh, yes! And good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this rather funny-shaped building in Reading where we are covering an exhibition match between Curtis "Lord, My God In Force" Walker and Ishmael "What a Shot, What a Bloody Net-buster" Thomas. Sh! LAUGHTER Sorry. HUSHED: I have to go back to this rather low voice, which is doing my bloody throat in. Start the commentary now, please! Right. And it's Curtis, "Lord, My God In Force" Walker. HUSHED: It's Curtis Walker to break. Achoo! LAUGHTER Oh, my God. What a bloody lame shot there from Curtis. He must be really upset with that. I mean, my auntie in Trinidad could have done better than that and she's a blind... HUSHED: Oh. Curtis must be really, really upset with himself about that shot there. Well, you have to admire the way the players keep their spirits up, don't you? And it's Ishmael to the table. HE CLEARS HIS THROAT HE COUGHS Look, go man take some cough medicine. LAUGHTER One. And another one. LAUGHTER Ref, clean the ball. It give a nasty kick. Nasty kick? I'll give you a nasty kick in a minute. Where's your manners? Clean it yourself. Besides, I don't want to get my gloves dirty. Commentator! Oh, yes! What a goal from the magical Johnny Barnes there. A slight suspicion of offside, but... Snooker! Snooker! Oh, yes. Snooker. Such a relaxing sport, invented by bored British armed officers whilst out in India... Stop waffling. Well, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, Ishmael has his balls nicely positioned for a lovely little trick shot now. LAUGHTER Well, that's about all we have time for tonight, ladies and gentlemen, so please join me in thanking Curtis "Lord, My God In Force" Walker and Ishmael "What a Shot, What a Bloody Net-buster" Thomas. APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING Who the hell is Chalky? LAUGHTER You see, it's always puzzled me. I remember when I was a little kid and my father took me to his place of work and it was the first time I heard it. We were walking across the yard and this white guy called out to my dad, "All right, Chalky?" And my dad replied... HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: "Yes, I'm fine." DEEPER VOICE: "Morning, Bob!" I said, "Dad, your name isn't Chalky." He said, "No, no, no. It's just a little joke." I remember thinking it must be a weird kind of joke because I've never seen my dad laugh like that before. You know the kind of laugh where... DEEP, FORCED CHUCKLE "Very funny." We carried on walking and another white man called out to my dad's friend. "Chalky, make us a cup of tea!" And my dad's friend, who was black, replied... HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: "Yes, I'll do it. Two sugars, no problem." And I knew his name wasn't Chalky because my dad had always called him Mr Thomas. So, I said, "Dad, has Mr Thomas changed his name?" He said, "No! It's just a little joke. "Now shut up and come on." LAUGHTER Now, I was a bright child. I know. Intelligent, no help. LAUGHTER So the next day I got to school, I went into the classroom, I said, "Sir, can I borrow a piece of chalk?" I held the chalk up to my face, said, "Sir, does this chalk look anything like me?" He said, "No." So, I said, "Then why do some white folks call us black folks chalky?" He said, "Oh, it's just a little joke." And then it dawned on me. You see, some white people call us "chalky" and think it's really funny! LAUGHTER APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Hello and welcome to Ask Auntiji at my usual peak-time slot of 2:30 AM on a Tuesday morning. I mean, that's all they think we are worth, isn't it? People make jokes about why Asian shops stay open all night. Now you know why. It's the only reason we get to watch some decent television. Anyway, as an agony auntie, I am often asked many questions about religion. Does God exist? And if so, why has Jim Davidson been given another television series? LAUGHTER At peak time as well! Now, I always remind people that I am a Hindu and we believe that people come back, sometimes as animals. In fact, last week I saw a spider I am sure was my dead Auntie Pushpa. LAUGHTER Well, it was shifty, had hairy legs and ended up face down in a pool of beer, so I'm sure it was her. It might have been a touching reunion, but unfortunately I dropped my daughter-in-law's chastity belt I was polishing at the time... ..and poor Pushpa got squashed to bits. Never mind. Maybe one day she will come back as a television controller and put me on at a decent time. Anyway, that's all for tonight, so goodnight. And especially to those career women out there, all alone, afraid in the dark, with no-one to protect you because you didn't listen to your mothers and marry that nice accountant from Harrow, goodnight. APPLAUSE MUSIC: A Watcher's Point of View by PM Dawn SINISTER ORGAN MUSIC SCREAMING MUSICAL ROARING And so our intrepid heroes prepare to stop Ragga Star the Music Monster. SINISTER ORGAN MUSIC We have been studying the conscious lyrics action pack and following Ragga Star for weeks. Tonight, we make our move against him. Yes, sensible. The venue he is playing is the Windmill Boulder arena. Mm-hm. And according to my research, we should be able to confront him and defeat him there. It's now or never. It's do or die. It's kill or be killed. It's... ..about time we stop this. LAUGHTER Are you scared? No. Oh. Well, just a little. Yes, I am. You? Me? No! Not much. Then on the other hand, yes. Yes. Remember your motto! BOTH: To make the world a better place for all the people who live in it. Soon come. How will our intrepid heroes face their first hurdle? Will they leap it in a single bound or will they fall flat on their face and break them teeth? Tune in next time. LAUGHTER Hi. AUDIENCE MEMBER WHOOPS I'd like to share something with you all tonight, if I may. Because I want you all to understand that I am a new man. LAUGHTER It's true. Come up and feel me. I'm so new, I'm still crispy. LAUGHTER I'm clean cut, clean shaven and clean thinking. I'm so new, you can still smell the wrapper, babe. I am a new man. I'm a ecologically, sociologically and totally logically honey-sound petal. I'm 100% natural and completely biodegradable. I'm so aware, I know your thoughts, your needs, your desires and your dreams. LAUGHTER Can't you see that, right in front of you, that I am your reality? I am a new man. Ooh! Oo-wee! You sweet, sweet thang! Don't you just know that you and me is got to be? I am a new man. Hands off the candy, dandy. You seriously expect any right-minded woman to fall for your pseudo-liberated "I'm a homes-loving brother" pile of bull? LAUGHTER You really need help if you think your synthetic, inverted macho persona cuts any kind of sway with me. CHEERING Child, I saw you coming before you were born. LAUGHTER And if you think you can just dress up that tired old jive talk with a few lines you once read in Ebony Magazine... LAUGHTER ..a loan shark's got better credentials. Michael Jackson's face has more integrity. You want to be new? You got to get real. Because right now, you sure ain't nothing but stale bread. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE But...babe. Baby. Baby. Yeah? Yeah? You still got something to say? But, babe... ..I can cry. LAUGHTER Sweet thing, crocodiles cry. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Thank you. Quiet! Thank you. BIRDS CHIRP They're all waiting for me to say a few words of comfort, I suppose, in the face of this terrible disaster. Poor things, seem awfully unhappy. Oh, yes, they are very upset. They asked for Bob Geldof, not you, so you better make an effort. LAUGHTER Um... Hello, everybody. You've been terribly brave in coping with this awful cyclone. Still, I'm sure that the three tonnes of water biscuits and super T-shirts that we have donated will come in jolly handy. CROWD SHOUTING: Gogi! Gogi! Don't worry about my airfare or hotel bills over here. You owe us Â£2 billion anyway, so this one's on me. CROWD SHOUTING: Gogi! Gogi! They love me. And, uh, "gogi" to you, too! That seemed to go rather well. Would you mind showing me around the village now? OK. MOOING AND PLOPPING LAUGHTER But mind you don't step in any gogi. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Make some noise! Hoo-hoo! Respect, respect. Now, I know you're all wondering about this word "respect". Well, wonder no more, but respect to your wondering. R is for reliable. E is for easy. S is for saying. P is for placed. E is for en vogue. C is for commentary. And T is for today. Reliable easy-saying placed en vogue commentary today. Respect to that. Respect to this. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Mi was wondering the other day whether mi could ah turn vegetarian. Because like ah mi not getting any younger, mi wan can't carry these bags heavy with meat an ting without do miself some damage. And even mi doctor say, "Too much red meat is not good for you." "It cause your blood vessels dem to co-an-jur-late." That mean block up. But no matter it fowl, goat, cow foot or fish from the sea, mi love it all. Mi could a never nyam rice without chicken, or two dumpling without lickle curry goat. And as for the jerk pork... Hm! Hm!

Is it good to you? # You got me singing, ooh... # CHEERING MUSIC FADES CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Greetings. Peace. My name is Jesus. LAUGHTER I'll get straight to the point. Who is this? Now, I know this is a very touchy subject, and I really don't want to upset anyone, but I'm upset. You see, there is no argument about where I was born. Bethlehem. And, OK, OK, I'll concede, it does get a bit chilly at night, but basically we're talking a hot country, and nobody born where I lived looked like this. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE In fact, when I was born, THIS is how I looked. Now, doesn't that make more sense? You see, the truth is staring you in the face, and you know the score. My mother and father, Mary and Joseph, were up and down the streets of Bethlehem trying to find a room for the night, so that my mother could have me. She was pregnant, right? But could they find a room? No. Why not? Because they were black! LAUGHTER APPLAUSE You see, nothing changes. There were signs above all the inn doors in Latin. Translated: "no children, no donkeys, no blacks". I am tired of being misrepresented. I am the original, the lamb. No, not your dinner. Don't look at me like that. It's crazy. Everywhere you look, you see pictures of this guy that's supposed to be me. But in the early days, we didn't have any cameras, and I don't remember sitting for any portraits. And while we're talking portraits, let's take that painting, the Last Supper, for instance. I don't recognise one of those guys around that table. The first time I saw it, I had to ask the question, which one is supposed to be me? Apparently, the same question was asked of the painter Michelangelo, and he answered, "Eeny, meeny, miney, mo, take your pick." And in case you're in need of further proof, just remember - when I was born, a very special star appeared in the skies above, and ever since that time that star has followed me everywhere I go. Peace. APPLAUSE CHEERING BLAST OF ORGAN Let's find out what's going on inside the Windmill Boulder Arena! The crucial mash up de album, ladies and gentlemen, de one fiyah nuff shot-maker!

ORGAN PLAYS ANNOUNCER: And so the dreaded Ragga Star is defeated, and Raggastein is reduced to tears, while our intrepid heroes go after the shifty ragamuffin. # Conscious Youth # Sensible Somebody. # ANNOUNCER: Our intrepid heroes are puzzled. I don't think I like the way that voice keeps calling us "intrepid". It's got a funny sound to it, don't it? It sounds so... It means that you are fearless and bold. Yes, my thoughts exactly. Yes, i-it sums us up rather nicely. But what about Raggastein, Liberator? Why didn't you put him out of his misery? That was not necessary. Are you sure, Liberator? I mean, he could still be very dangerous. That's right. Liberator, you said you fought Raggastein for years. You had him just where you wanted. Why didn't you let us finish him off? Because he is my brother. I know this will come as a tremendous shock to you both, but we were born of the same mother. We were separated as children and became enemies, fighting for different principles. Despite all the wrong he has done, I do not hate him. I love him and only wish to see him reformed. I can't believe we didn't see the connection before. I mean, the family resemblance has been staring us in the face. What you talking about, Conscious? What family resemblance? Nose? Lips? It's certainly not the way they dress! Come on, explain yourself. What family resemblance? Their voices. Hm? Hm? They both sound... Mash up! Sh! Well, they do. You can't say mash up...! ORGAN PLAYS And so, that just about wraps it up. Our intrepid, fearless and bold heroes can go home, put on their slippers and wait for the phone to ring. Raggastein has been defeated. Or has he? Tune in next time. DRAMATIC ORGAN APPLAUSE
