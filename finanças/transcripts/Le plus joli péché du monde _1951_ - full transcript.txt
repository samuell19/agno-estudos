That's everything, director. I'm satisfied. Thanks. Let's summarize, miss. Having been sales assistant at Wonders of Venice for three days only, which isn't a long time, you managed to break goods worth 60,000 francs, which is a lot. That was after you almost had a fight with a customer, which is going too far. Do you agree with me? Yes, sir. You claim that the customer disrespected you and even that she insulted you? Yes, sir! Miss, there's a rule in sales which says that a paying customer is always right. To conclude, I feel obliged to do without your services. EXPERT SEAMSTRESS NEEDED POSITION FILLED It's sad that a young woman like you has to eat a croissant for lunch. BUTCHERS RENT WILL BE COLLECTED TOMORROW MORNING. THE JANITOR. Who is it? It's me, Zoé. Sorry, dear. I thought you were the 8:47 train. The 8:47 train? It's the name of a client because he's so punctual. Come in. It's nice of you to come and say hello. I was just about to eat. I hope that's OK? Oh no. I can't stand watching others eat after I've finishedr. Not you? Look at me. You seem a bit pale. Are you sure you've eaten? Yes, I… When? Yesterday? The day before yesterday? Oh you silly thing. Come on, sit down and eat. What about you ma'am? Don't worry about me, I need to lose at least two kilograms… Hurry and eat. Sorry. It's silly. Listen, cry as much as you want but you need to eat too. Come on, make an effort. Open your mouth. See, it doesn't stop you from eating. A glass of red? And now, tell me. It'll take the weight off. You can speak with your mouth full. I was fired. I had an argument with a customer because she called me a whore. So I ran around all day looking for work and when I got home, I found the janitor's letter about rent. It's too much. So I wanted to kill myself with gas but it smells too bad. God, you're silly… Do you need money? - I can lend you some! - No thanks, miss. I don't want money. I've made an important decision. I want a lover. Swallow and repeat that. I didn't quite understand. I want a lover! - What? - Yes, absolutely! I'm sick of being a babe in the woods. And I saw that it can be lucrative so I've decided to find a lover. A rich one, of course. You're as qualified for a life of debauchery as I am for singing at church. I'm no uglier than the others. No, you're prettier. But what does that prove? You're like pink and blue porcelain that isn't ovenproof, that's all. I want a lover. I'll grab the first I see! But the first is never the right one. And the rest aren't much better, trust me. Fine, I'll go home and turn the gas on. I might get used to the smell. You're crazy. Stay here! Listen, Miss Liliane, tomorrow I can be a living whore or a dead babe in the woods. You choose. When would you want to start? Right away. Okay fine, let me disguise you as a mortal sin. Come this way. There's going to be a scramble for you. Be careful though. I'd feel more at ease if I came with you. But it's impossible. My 8:47 train will soon be here. How do you feel? The shoes are a bit big. Good. That way you'll walk slower. Women who walk too fast don't walk well. Let me give you a few tips. First, find a guy rolling in money. You mustn't judge a book by its cover. Be wary of silk shirts with embroidered initials, of crocodile skin shoes and Swiss gold watches with matching straps. Nine times out of ten it's hoodwinking. No. You need to look at the details. The quality of a garment, for example. Only go for pure wool. I actually worked in a fashion boutique for six months. See, kiddo. Everything comes in useful in life. If he's got a Legion of Honor to boot, you can go for him without a doubt. Those men are generally decent. Oh and then there's the car. The car is very important. Above all, don't go for a sport's car with a low rear end. Men with those cars are bad. No, choose a big limousine which looks like a sleeping car. That way, he might have a family. That's the dream. At least, you'll know what to talk about. I was sales assistant in a repair shop so… Were you a manicurist too, by any chance? Yes, why? Because of the nails. Look at the nails. Immaculate hands means he has time to spare. And that requires means. You should write a book, Miss Liliane. I can't because of the past participles. Now you need to leave. My 8:47 train must be near. Thanks Miss Liliane. Yes, okay. Hurry! NUDISTS, A MUSICAL SHOW Miss, excuse me, I fear you won't find a taxi in this neighborhood at this hour. Be wary of Swiss gold watches with matching straps. I was just about to get dinner. Dining alone is a punishment which I don't deserve. If you're as nice as you seem… Be wary of crocodile shoes. Nine times out of ten it's hoodwinking. Allow me to drop you off somewhere. My car is at your service. Above all, avoid sports cars with a rear end low on the ground. Men with those cars are bad. Thanks, sir. Choose a large limousine, one like a sleeper car. Is the owner of this car in the bar? He's the only one. He must have got lost. Another Martini. Very well, sir. And for the lady? A Martini. Look at the details. The quality of the garments, for example. Only go for pure wool. A small Martini. If he's got a Legion of Honor to boot, go for it. Men like that are generally decent. Barman. Could you tell me the time? It's 9:20, on the dot. Call me a taxi. A taxi? It's off-speak. You must go to the Champs-Élysées. Oh… How annoying. Allow me to drop you off. Sir, you're too kind. I don't want to take advantage. Oh no, I assure you it's no big deal. Are you going far? I… I'm going to Auteuil, to some friends. Oh that's just across the park, it's almost on my way. Oh well, in that case… How much were the two drinks? Sir, please. - I want to pay for my drink! - No, ma'am. It would displease me. In that case… Is it the 12 cylinder? No, it's the eight. - Only? - Yes, I'm sorry. DRIVING SCHOOL DUROZOIR WITH DUROZOIR, LEARNING IS KNOWING I have to say, I'm the sentimental type. It's so rare these days. Yes. I deserve praise, you know? My blood pressure is 22. And I've got a character… Does it bother you if I drive like this? Is that what you call being sentimental? Oh, I get it! I wasn't born yesterday! A pretty girl who accepts to cross the Bois de Boulogne at 10 p.m… I wouldn't have trusted any old person. - If you didn't have the Legion of Honor… - What? You don't have a Legion of Honor? The Legion of Honor? That's a myth. The what? It's some Tunisian thing a friend gave me when I was in Kairouan. Do you sell carpets? No, hardly. My name is Durozoir. Durozoir Driving school. - Don't you recognize it? - No! Stop, let me out! Shut up. Stop! I'm ordering you to stop! Oh, come on… Careful! Idiot! Don't you know how to stay on the right? Bad drivers shouldn't drive! I, Durozoir, don't know how to drive? Durozoir Driving school. Oh you're Durozoir? Well, you don't hide from advertising. It's the lady's fault. She hit me! He tried to rape me! Yes but everyone drives on the right in France, even lechers. You're not going to believe her, are you? A girl I picked up in a bar. Picked up! Steady on, young lady. I want him alive. I don't care about all your tales. You're going to sign the paper which states you're in the wrong from A to Z. Otherwise I'll ensure you get a great deal of publicity in the papers. Fine. You've got me in a corner. Excuse me. Nothing serious? No. Thankfully. In that case, you could maybe ask me if I'm hurt. Sorry? That's what one usually asks a woman who has just been in an accident. I'm very sorry. Are you hurt? No. I'm actually cured. Cured from what? Of the Legion of Honor. Sorry, but you're very hard to follow. There, sir. Quite correct. You just need training with Versini and you'll be a respectable gentleman. No need to make comments, sir. Can you take me back to Paris? I don't want to push Mr. Durozoir's blood pressure too far. - I'd be happy to but… - Me too. Good riddance. Swear you won't slap me. That depends on you. You sing out of tune. It doesn't matter, I don't have a good ear. I do. I can see one and it's charming. If the other one is as charming… Keep your eyes on the road. What do you do for a living? Truck driver? Mover? Both. And you? You can drop me off at the Crillon. There. Thank you. You can drink to my health. Who's health? Tell me your first name at least? Zoé. Zoé? It's a bit short, but I don't need much. Goodbye Zoé. Don't go to that park again. Oh and my name is Jacques. I can't help it. Good evening. Oh, oh! What are you playing at? Come on, Zoé, don't pretend to be a great lady living at the Crillon. I don't believe you. What are you saying, young man? Those who stay at the Crillon don't go to the Bois de Boulogne with Durozoirs. They wear real fox fur. And shoes that fit. You're so much nicer as you are. - Leave me alone. - Later. First, I'm going to take you to a restaurant for a feast. - I don't want to… - I'm warning you, I'm a dangerous brute, that doesn't like it when Zoés resist. Let's go. - Is the turkey coming? - In a moment. Here's the menu. A moment's silence for this fine beast, kids… It smells so good. I hadn't eaten any in so long that I'd forgotten it was an edible animal. Jacques! Sorry to disturb, I just wanted to say hi. How are you? - Good. - Me too. All set for tomorrow? Yes, tomorrow. A wonderful farewell. - Congratulations. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. I say, there's an empty table. What did they mean about the farewell? Nothing. Eat your chicken. I can't thank Durozoir enough. Without him, I'd never have had this. Be thankful for me. Oh it's not the same. You weren't the man I was looking for. You were looking for a man? 50 years old, a large car and a pure wool suit. Good God, why? That's a secret. I hope you'll tell me the secret one day. We'd need to see each other again. I've no intention of losing sight of you. In the meantime, if I were to give you a quick kiss, just a little one behind the ear, would you smash the carafe over my head? Try it, if you're not a coward. So, what's your impression? It's the best chicken I've had in my life. I'll give you the recipe. You take a young man. Always the same one, of course. You sit him down next to you. When the chicken is cooked, you close your eyes. And then we start again. I've understood. I might be being a bit nosy, but do you leave far from the Crillon? 22 rue des Vinaigriers. Jacques! See you tomorrow, old friend. And… enjoy the farewell. How much do we owe you, ma'am? Let me tell you. They won't let this farewell go. Are you farewelling someone tomorrow? Not tomorrow. Tonight. Tonight? I'm saying goodbye to single life. I'm getting married at Neuilly city hall at 11 a.m. tomorrow. I see. It's hilarious. - Zoé… - I know the tradition! It brings good luck to spend one's bachelor's party with a pretty girl! Especially if one sleeps with her! - Zoé, I swear… - I don't want to bring you good luck! Zoé! Zoé! Oh, a shoe! I find this atmosphere overwhelming. It really hammers the point home. You're not going to start crying, are you? It's anxiety. I shouldn't have come. He'll see you. It'll shock him and it'll ruin his marriage. Better than nothing. I wish him no harm. He behaved like a boor! I want young women to be respected. It's not much. He wasn't to know I was a young girl. It's not obvious. Popaul! Popaul… Leave the lady alone! Lollipop! Oh, what an awful kid. Here. Would you have the time, please? 11:30 a.m.! And Gustave isn't here yet! He's my friend. He's taking the plunge this morning and I'm his first witness. I need to give him a call. Could you look after Popaul a few minutes? Here's the packet. It should keep him busy for about half an hour. If that's not enough, we'll make him swallow the sticks. Yes. Dad! Dad! The mayor. Popaul, Popaul… Look at the handsome man with a big scarf. Can you see him? The Lebreton wedding. The Lebreton wedding. That's him. I say! Quite impressive for a truck driver's wedding. What are you talking about? That's Jacques Lebreton, the son of the Left Bank antique dealer. A big antique house in Paris. Are you sure it's him? Oh yes. Move forward. Yes. Miss, sir. Before I proceed with the official vows, allow me to say some more personal words. I'd like to express my real joy at the thought of uniting in happiness a charming heiress of one of France's most prestigious noble families with the only child of a man, better still, of an artist who has done such a good job protecting the reputation of art nationally and internationally… Let's go. I'm ashamed. Are you joking? Let them simmer a little. And we can't abandon the kid. Lollipop! - …each day accentuating… - Shucks! - Lollipop! - Yes, there. …and the erasure of moral values, it is particularly pleasing to know that two great families, great in the past, and great in the present, are going to be united forever through the love of their children. It will lead to a better future full of comforting promises. You miss, and you, sir, must keep the promises which you'll make today in the union of your young selves and the great names that you bear. Dad, lollipop! - Dad! - Popaul! Come here, Popaul! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is outrageous behavior! It's manipulation. It's a frame up! The girl wants to dishonor our family. Clément! Clément, I'm suffocating! Congratulations, Jacques. I didn't think you were so disorganized. Sir is a… is a… a badly bought up person. Well, mother-in-law… Come, mother. He doesn't need me. Yes. The worst is done. Jacques, we are dishonored. Speak, will you! Reply, defend yourself! I'd like you to meet your grandson. That's enough! Dad, dad! Enough! Proof, do you hear me? We want proof! I'm not a gullible fool. As if you have a five-year old son. He wouldn't be capable of it. It would be very convenient. My husband is trying to say it's impossible. Jacques never left us, you see! He's always at the store or on the road! When would he have found time to have a child on top of that? I'm asking you! What surprises me is that you're asking us. Say something! Me? I stand by what I said. He's my son. For a start, he has grandfather's nose. He's got any old person's nose! That girl has misled you, you stupid fool. That kid is not an authentic Lebreton, he's a copy. This is blackmail. Christine, I'm sincerely sorry, that this unfortunate incident happened the day of our wedding. But maybe it's better that way. We don't love each other. We were engaged, sir. My marriage was agreed upon! Honor your commitments. Okay. As long as Popaul's presence in our home doesn't bother you. I'll conceive my own children. Let's go, Mother. You're right. Our lawyers can deal with this. We'll keep the ring. Please don't leave like this on a wedding day! At least give me some time to explain. I'll prove that the young lady lied and that the child is the result of horrible scheming. Come now, father! Scheming doesn't result in kids. Be quiet! Your mom and I refuse to believe this story until we've questioned the culprit! Go fetch her immediately! With her Popaul. I'll give you an hour. Only? Where do you expect me to find her? Where you usually do, I guess. Yes, of course. Right. I'll try. The one on the left. Would you like a glass of champagne? That's not necessary. At least take a seat. I suppose. No, leave me alone. I want to die. Did the blond guy try to lead you on? Yes or no? It's my fault! I led him to believe things and now, I've ruined his life. The kid? Quick, where's the kid? - Sir, I… - Where's the kid? I need him right away. Is he yours? No, someone had lent him to me… I'd been entrusted with him, I mean. And I lost him. What? Lost him? How does one find lost kids? One goes to the lost kids office. Too long! I'll go where you want, sir. I'll grovel at your parents' feet. I'll tell the truth. I'll prove your innocence and mine, if it's necessary. Bravo. And I'd have to marry Christine. That's without mentioning her mom. Because that's a family where you marry the mother. No, I want the kid. Who entrusted him to you? A man who was waiting for a wedding. But he didn't tell me his name. We need to find him, it's proof. My proof! What proof? The proof that I have a child, obviously! Christine doesn't want a child. Not like that, I mean. Was it your idea to make him run to me? No, it was mine. May I kiss you? I'm here for it. Ah… If the man was waiting for a wedding we can check the register. We'll get hold of Popaul. Let's go to the city hall! CITY HALL THE CITY HALL OF NEUILLY MARRIAGE REGISTRY I raise my glass to the clever little God… I just need a second! I've got him! That's not him. Shucks! Sorry. Stay calm. Please stay calm. Sorry. I forgot to close the door. Edmond, you were marvellous! Thanks. I raise my glass… I raise my glass to our dear old friend, Patrick Duval! Yeah! Oh, sorry. I just need some information. What is it, dude? Can't you see this is a wedding? Don't get angry, I'm just passing through. I just wanted to ask you a question. Do you need someone called Popaul? Popaul… He's asking if we know Popaul! Popaul… Yeah of course we know Popaul! Why? I'd like to see him, I need him. Just a minute. Bring him out! Here's Popaul! The one and only! They call him the panther of Courbevoie. 21 wins by knockout. Is he your guy? No, not at all. We're looking for a little Popaul. A Popaul who is five or six. Oh, a kid! We don't have one. Not yet! Never mind, I'll swing by another time. Ladies and gentlemen… Excuse me. Serve him some more! CLOSED FOR A CELEBRATION Oh it's the young lady from the city hall! You well and truly abandoned my kid. If only you knew what happened… He told me. It's hilarious. May I speak with you five minutes? This way. It's personal. What's going on? Don't worry. Here, drink! Come on. Give me your glass. It's not every day one gets married! Come on. Stop that, will you? Lollipop! You can have one when you stop! Lollipop! Here. - Thanks Dad. - You're welcome. What a kid! He's always giving me orders. And with my health, I had indigestion! I won't beat around the bush, I need Popaul. Could I rent him off you? What? My family… My family is forcing me into a marriage which I really don't want! Jérôme, what are you doing there? I'm watching the store, sir. Tell me, are… Yes, sir. Mr. and Mrs. Lebreton, your mother-in-law and your wife are in the lounge. Watch your head. Thanks. - Dear God, Clément! - What? It's true. He's got your father's nose! Leave my dad's nose alone. So, you're the… of my son? Yes, sir. How old is the… I mean, my… Your child? Five years old. - What do you think of him? - Ill-timed! Do you have any family? No, sir, I'm an orphan. That's a start! Miss or ma'am, I don't need to highlight quite how huge the scandal is which you caused this morning! I didn't cause anything at all! The little one recognized his father… Are you sure he's the father? Oh… Sir! Oh… Dad! Dad! He's so cute. Now, now Ariette. Ariette… Oh yes, true. I'm sorry. Don't mention it. He really is adorable. I couldn't have made a better one. Popaul, say hello to the lady. I don't want to. Me neither. Come, mother. Christine! Christine. I'm very sorry, Christine, please forgive me. You can tell that to my lawyers. Good evening. Watch out for the steps. There. Yes. That's a good thing done. Shut up! No need to add impudence to the list along with sexual misbehavior! Miss or ma'am, what's done is done. I'm not going to make a speech on this scandal's disastrous consequences. Only one thing matters, the existence of my son's son. There's only one solution. Marriage. But… But sir, I… Do not think we're happy about this. But it's necessary. We'll try to accept the idea. - I won't. - What did you say? I said no. A lover and a kid are just about okay, but getting married is taking it too far. Zoé! I forbid you to leave this house! I'm not leaving it. I respect our deal. But don't speak to me about marriage after everything. Ah, well that's a first! How can she refuse to become my son's wife after being okay with being his lover… And the mother of his child. It's because you forced her. One mustn't force her. She's got principles. Come with me, Zoé. Mr. Popaul got hold of a catapult, which he uses to pelt me with chickpeas 12 hours a day. It's awful and it really hurts, sir. I regret to inform you that I quit, sir. Allow me to add, that I've never met a worse brat than your grandson, sir. - Jérôme! - Oh sorry. Please forgive me sir, but I'd rather go back to my family. I'll leave in an hour. We're going to have to find another manservant. It would be great to find a small, skinny one. Why? He'd been harder to aim at. What are you doing here? What's got into you? I'd told you to not set foot in here! Don't blame me. I'm hung up on something. You're hung up on something? Yes. A friend who works in a pharmacy told me that's what it is. I'm hung up on Popaul. I can't live without him. It's strange, isn't it? At the time, I thought, "Earning 300 francs per hour is like a blessing from God." You're not taking the kid back, are you? You'll have to come to terms with it. I'll even give you the money back. That's how bad things are. No, you're not allowed. I had your word. Yes, but I'm hung up on Popaul. Jacques, come here a minute. Please excuse me a moment. Your mother and I are going to the job center because Jérôme is leaving us. Why? He's selfish and doesn't like kids. Anyway, we need a new manservant. I have an idea. Don't move. I've come up with an amazing idea. Come with me, old friend! Here. Let me introduce you to an old friend from the war. Albert Pignol, known as Bébert. - Sir. - Hello, sir. Hello. How are you? It just so happens that Bébert is looking for work. Bébert is a surprising man. He can do everything. I'm sure he could replace Jérôme. That depends. Who was the guy? Jérôme was our manservant. He left us for health reasons. But he also took care of my son Popaul a lot. That changes everything! Do you like kids? You've no idea… Have you served before? In the army, chief! Five years. No. I mean as a servant? Well, I was the captain's orderly… Things were lively. Since sir was a hero with our Jacques. I agree. If you would come up to the apartment my friend, we can discuss the conditions. Let's go. No, you get that Dad. I… I'll help mom regarding Bébert. If you want. Hello, sir. Hello, ma'am. Hello, sir. Zoé! Zoé! Zoé! Where's your mom? I mean, Zoé? She went out! She wouldn't take me. Lollipop! - What? - Give me a lollipop! I'd like to highlight its perfect state. That's what is bothering me. Oh, sir. Ah? Hello. He is my son. My dear, listen to yourself speak. You wanted a rich old man. You got a young man who is rolling in it and you send him away. I don't want to stay there… as a lie. For a start, he's a player. I'll never understand young girls. Yes? Come in. One second. - Can't you see I'm talking? - Oh sorry. I'm leaving, I'm stopping you from working. Shut up, you're giving me a nice break. You're like a romantic novel that I sometimes read before bed. I'm a romance novel? What a great romance novel. It's a swindle, a breach of trust! Darling, happy women have no qualms! You think I'm happy? That just proves you don't know me well. He's a liar, an egoist, a monster, a horrible individual… In short, you think he's charming? You're on the right path. Don't forget that you got him in this mess with the kid. Sorry, Miss Liliane, but you did it. You'll thank me one day. Now go. In less than eight days, he'll have taken you in his arms. He's too stupid. If ever he touches me, I'll rip his eyes out! That's what everyone says at first. Goodbye Miss Liliane. Goodbye darling. And? Are you following me now? No, I was looking for you. I need to speak about our manservant. How extremely interesting. I don't want to hold a meeting on the sidewalk. Come with me. Get in. Didn't your parents teach you any manners? That's your personal opinion. If only you had an ounce of honesty, you'd stop putting on this farce for your parents. It's a form of self-defense. And anyway, who's fault is it? I didn't ask you to give me a kid. If I've understood correctly, you're now the father of your manservant's child? You're good at making things simple, that's for sure! Oh, there you are. Finally. You left like a madman, without warning anyone. Like a madman? No! There's another complication. Read this. What a pain! Uncle Jo is coming. I don't understand. It's my brother. He's called Georges. He went to America when he was 18 to make a fortune, only, it didn't work out. 25 years later he tried to drown himself but he failed again. No. It was in the New Mexico desert. He was filling his pockets with stones to prevent himself from floating, when he suddenly realized that the river was bled dry. The river too? What a country. So he emptied his pockets and upon looking a bit closer he thought they seemed strange. So he had them analyzed and that's how he became the uranium king. And now he's announcing his arrival for our wedding. Well, my wedding. He's worth five or six million dollars. What are we going to do? Sell him! Very funny. Try to understand the situation, my child. We're not bothered that my brother is a billionaire. Thank God, we're above social prejudice. Unfortunately, my uncle is a strange man. The drowning miracle gave him a terrible shock. He became a Quaker. Dear God. He thinks he's a cake? What do you mean? A Quaker is a type of cake. No, my child. A Quaker is a follower of Quakerism. And Quakerism is a puritanical sect, which has been widespread across North America since the 18th century. Quakers don't joke around with morality. My uncle thinks I'm married. But I'm not married. And you're living under the same roof with… You get me. If my presence is a problem, I'm happy to go. That would be worse. No, we'll just say you're Jacques' wife. As with all Quakers, my brother is very naïve, so he won't examine things too closely. He may be naïve, but it will be difficult to convince him that your son and I have a five-year-old son after 15 days of marriage. Good God, I'd forgotten about Popaul! Send him to the country. Too late. Your uncle arrives tomorrow. Your mother wouldn't accept. No, we need to find another solution. Careful! Another solution, but what? I don't know. Oh! I've got an idea. Albert. Albert? Which Albert? The new manservant. We'll say that Popaul is Albert's son. Do you get it? Uncle Jo will fall for it hook, line and sinker. Popaul, the son of Albert… What a great idea! I'd never have thought. Obviously, he'll have to agree to it but why would he refuse? He loves kids and… we can offer him some money. You're going to pay Bébert, I mean Albert, to be Popaul's father? That's the icing on the cake. There's no other solution! Come on. Hands up! Hands up! Let's start again. Hands up! No, higher! Popaul! It's perfect, they get on so well, as implausible as that may seem. Stranger things have happened, you know. If I offer him 5,000 francs a day, do you think he'll agree to it? Start out at 4,000. Right. Carry on. So, since uncle Jo is coming tomorrow… Thanks. …I'm going to fill you in on what makes the Quakers different. They are extremely strange, you know. They don't use titles like "Miss", "Madam", "Sir". They say "sister" to women and "brother" to men. They always wear a hat. Even when they sleep? Probably. As far as you're concerned, that doesn't matter. He uses informal language with everyone, there are no exceptions. So, if a stranger kisses you tomorrow uses informal language and calls you "sister Zoé", don't slap him. That will be my uncle. It's a good job you warned me. Where is he going to sleep? I'm in the spare room. Dear child, for the next few days maybe you could… No. Obviously, that wouldn't be appropriate. Maybe Jacques could sleep in Popaul's room? Come quickly, I'm very worried! Popaul won't sleep! He's crying, he's feverish and turning down lollipops! - Seriously? - We need a doctor! No, don't panic. Go, my dear. Sing something to him. Me? You want me to sing? You know very well that he calms down as soon as you sing to him. Don't make us beg! The cheek… He sings off key, do you see? And that makes the kid laugh. Of course! Come on, Jacques, come sing something! It's a lie! Jacques, stop being ridiculous. Sing to the kid. Am I being clear? Come on. Come with us, Albert. The kid seems to like you a lot. My darling! Give me your skittles. Give me them! I want my skittles! Leave the skittles! Calm down, darling. If you're good, Dad will sing you a song. Dad? Which one? He's so funny! He's got such a way with words! Daddy Jacques, of course. Oh, the blond one. Your cigar will make the kid cough! That's true, I'm sorry. Sing! What are you waiting for? Come on, sing! Popaul darling must have a favorite song? Yes. La Marseillaise. He loves La Marseillaise. It's very strange. Not at all! My father was officer by trade! So? Sing La Marseillaise, my dear! Oh yes. Sing! Sing La Marseillaise, come on! Do it. Arise, children of the Fatherland, Our day of glory has come Against us the bloody flag of tyranny is raised. Hello, brother. How's it going? Me? Not bad, thanks. Sir is too kind. Call me "brother" and don't be so formal. All men are equal on Earth. Oh really? I hadn't noticed. Go tell brother Clément that brother Jo has arrived. Brother Clément? Brother Clément Lebreton, your boss. Really? Sir is… You're the brother of the boss? Yes. Go. May God be with you. No need, I know the way. Clément! Oh Georges! I thought the flight from America arrives in an hour. I took a private jet. It's very useful. I would've loved to be here for the wedding. Did it go well? It had been a long time since such a wedding! Albert, take the gentleman's coat. Brother, a free man does not take his hat off in front of a free man. You'll catch a cold, brother. No, Albert, show some respect. He told me to be informal. Isn't that right? Yes, brother. I'll never get used to it. Come this way. Ow. Whisky? No thanks, I'm fine. I'm fine too. I thought Quakers didn't drink? Never. But they do have to follow the doctor's orders. I've got a very good doctor. Here's Jacques. Uncle Jo! I'm glad to see you. How are you? - And you? - I'm well. How's the honeymoon? Wonderful. Is your wife ready? My wife? Oh yes, she'll be here right away. I can't wait to meet sister Zoé. I understand. - Whisky? - No, thanks. My doctor won't allow it. You should change your doctor. Hello brother Jo. I'm sister Zoé. Did you have a good trip? Very good. Pleased to meet you, little sister. What's this dress? It's the one I wore the first time we met, darling. Don't you remember? The night you fought with that man at the bois de Boulogne. You met during a fight in the Bois de Boulogne? - Yes! - How curious. No, she's joking of course. Oh… alas, I wish that were the case. I'm sorry if you're shocked by my dress brother Jo. It's my last reminder from my sorry past. She's crazy. Come, my child… What's the point of lying? My entire youth was spent in debauchery. Zoé! Don't listen to her, it's a joke! They would call me "Zozo from Bastille", because of the neighborhod. And I would call all men "my darling". At first, I thought Jacques was just like the other clients, but no. I loved him. It's stupid isn't it? I don't know what's got into her. You know me, I'd never… tolerate… You'd have been wrong, brother. Blessed are those who decide to save a soul regardless of their prejudices. Don't be ashamed about having welcomed little sister into your home. God is everywhere. Whisky? Of course! It feels good as it goes down. This is Popaul. - The manservant's son. - My trumpet! Give me my trumpet! I want my trumpet! Be a good boy and say hello to the brother. I don't have a brother. I have two fathers, but I don't have a brother! He's got two fathers? No, of course not! He can't count. I'll kick you if you don't give me a lollipop! Popaul, please! I want a lollipop! Leave him alone. He'll be a great businessman. He's talented. Here are the lollipops, little brother. Two gold dollars? You're mad. Leave him alone, it'll be some cash for him. My lollipop! Uncle Jo, would you like to rest in your room? Gladly. See you soon, little sister. Come with me, Jo. She's charming. She's charming, but… And now, how about I slap you? Your uncle would have to pick up the pieces. Why did you tell all those lies? What are you trying to do? It's vengeance. I hate you. I'm too loyal to abandon you, so I'm trying to get kicked out. That's what I did at school when I was little. It worked well. Oh yeah? Well, it doesn't work on me, you're staying. At your own risk. I'll wear you down. I'm hard-wearing. You don't know me. I'll give you grey hairs. While I wait for my hair to turn gray, I'll deal with this customer. Wait for me here. Why don't you go sing an anthem to Popaul? You're so good at it. I'll deal with the customer. - In that dress? - Why not? Yes. At this stage… Sir? Excuse me, miss. How much are these opalines? 1,000 francs. 1,000 francs? 1,000 francs. What about the Japanese dish on the Spanish table? 1,000 francs. And this? 1,000 francs. Are you sure? Every item in this store is 1,000 francs. Everything? We've got a promotion week on. Oh… Thanks. How much does that come to? Six times 1,000 francs. 6,000 francs. Yes, obviously. May I? Um… Thanks. Two, three, four, five, six. Thanks. I'll be back! The client already left. Yes, this very minute. Here, 6,000 francs. I wonder what you possibly could have sold him for 6,000 francs. Three opalines, the chest, the Chinese ivory and the Japanese dish. And the Japanese dish… Oh… 6,000? That was worth at least 250,000 francs! You're a thief! Did you hear me? That's theft! Absolutely. And what does one do with thieves? One kicks them out. Goodbye. I'll get my things. That would be too easy my girl! Your girl? Me! Here. Oh! You brute! Am I disturbing you? Yes. No. We were just discussing this carpet. This wool carpet. I'd just come to get sister Zoé to go for a drink. Okay, Uncle Jo. I just need to get changed and then I'm all yours. My brother told me you married out of love, but to this extent… It's marvellous. You're mistaken if you don't believe me! I was well known in those circles! Zozo from Bastille. I lived at 22 rue des Vinaigriers. The gentlemen would come to my room. Poor little sister… Why do you say "poor"? I had a lot of work! They would give me money that I would put in my bath. I was born to lead a life of debauchery. I'm talented. Awfully so. Taxi! 22 rue des Vinaigriers. LEATHERS AND SKINS CERF-ALLEXANDRE Liliane, Liliane! - Oh, hello darling. - Hello. What a surprise! I didn't think I would see you again. - How are you? - Fine. Here, look. This is my friend, Liliane! Oh, so you managed to find yourself an old man? And the other one? This one is a billionaire. He doesn't look his age. Shall we go? The taxi will take you home. I'm staying. I'm going to be with sister Liliane. You can't be serious, brother? You're a Quaker. - A what? - Don't worry about it. Really, Uncle Jo… Let Uncle Jo be, little sister. Is he your brother or uncle? Both. Come, little sister. What shall we do? Shall we chat or what? Let's chat little sister. As you wish. It's the same price. So? I'd like some information. That's not usually what I'd do. Information on what, for a start? On sister Zoé, on brother Jacques, on all the things that are being hidden from me but which you know about. I'm under the impression Uncle Jo is being taken for a ride. I don't like rides, sister Liliane. Don't call me sister Liliane, it makes my head spin. Tell me about sister Zoé. No. I love that kid, if you want to know the truth. She's great. You can eat your hat if that's not enough information. I bet you can't pile it up as high as your shoulder. How much do you want to bet? What are you doing here? We just dropped in to say hello. We were missing you! How's it going? Fine, thanks. If things are bad, I'll write. Come on now, goodbye. Goodness, all of this is very pretty! It must be worth a lot of money! It's copies of old things. It's fake! Yeah right, as if! Listen, guys. You need to know that I'm no longer part of your racket. For a start, the people here are generous. No, I've settled down. In other words, you're Saint Bébert. That's enough. Watch us. Why? There. And now kid, two things. You either shout or you don't. If you shout, I'll stuff an oriental rug in your mouth. So you'll shout in Turkish. Bunch of bastards. Here, catch this to wrap it. Spread it out. There. Here. See, when you're a good boy… When you've finished selling pianos, why don't you come and earn your living? Yeah, I'm coming. But first, let me see where these stairs go. What's going on, Bébert? He doesn't want it. Oh, what a monster. Oh! Be careful, boss! That was clever! Why would you tell him that? Come on! That kid was fiesty! Let's put him in the big thing there. There we go! - Jacques, my dear! - It's your turn! Hey! Hey! If you shout, I'll rape you. Aren't you ashamed of talking to a young lady like that? Step back, you ill-bred person! Do you think we'd better shift? Yeah, for sure! This is a real blood bath. Help! Help! Do something. Clément! Clément… At least this one has manners. She deserves to go on the bed. There we go! Here, pass me the cushion. Go on, Dartagnan! Take that, you smartass! Let's lay the musketeer beside his lady. Come on. Let's get out of here. I've had enough. They look like the eternal return. Calm down. Brother, it's time to repent. Hit with the sword, die by the sword. It's fine, he's a missionary. I'll take care of him. Shit, who is this guy? It's Popeye. A hero, brother! You're a hero! Oh, sorry. I thought Quakers didn't ever fight? Never. But we are permitted to set lost sheep on the right path. The brother is quite someone. I endeavored to extract your souls from the darkness of evil, brothers. Leave and don't sin any more. Where are Jacques and his wife? Jacques and his wife? They need marrying quick smart. How so? I assure you that… Shut up, brother, I know everything. Zoé is a good girl and a good match. She's got 10% of my uranium mines. Marry her to brother Jacques. They'll give you a handsome grandson. What do you mean? What about the other one? I'll explain later. Where are they though? In the wardrobe. In the wardrobe? What are they doing there? The prettiest sin in the world.
