My Father is My Mother That was exhausting! Dancing is such fun. Just look at you! I'm still beautiful. Whatever. Why aren't you dancing? You're wallowing in sorrow again. Girls, let's go home. What a spoilsport you are! Why don't you dance? I don't feel like it. Darling sister, are you still being a drama queen? A broken heart is so passe. Bitch. You're not a star in a soap opera. Why don't you dance? I said, I don't want to. What for did I lend you those feathers and that cabbage rose? Big deal, they're giving me a rash. Come on. You look so pretty! They're playing our song! Let' S Shake it, sister! What are you doing here? Are you with this whore? Oh well. The battle of the faggots. Aha! Here we go again. Give that back. Dioscoro Derecho, don't tell me you're still carrying the torch. No wonder we're having bad luck. Because of this! Give me that. Whatever did you see in Dionisio Hammond? He's just a typical mestizo. So he's typical. Give me that. He's been gone for a year and you're still pining for him. What a martyr. Give her a break. They did have some kind of relationship. He's like a brother to me. Or a nephew. A nephew! What a lie! What lie? It's the truth. Right, you just gazed at each other for five years. Five years just gazing! It's called platonic love. You drive me batty. Give that back! Hey! Stop the cab. We're getting off. Get out! We' re just paying LIP- What a night! Hey, ladies! Where you going? Uncle Goring? Dionisio. Come in. You look like you've seen a ghost. Is it really you? It's been a long time. I'm sorry, I was busy. What's that? A baby. A baby? It is a baby. Whose is that? Where'd you find it? It's mine. I'm going to be late for work. Who's the mother? Mariana. Mariana who? Mariana Jimenez. Who is she? A woman. I know that. I'm not stupid. What does she do? She's from Cebu. From Cebu. She's a nightclub hostess. Hostess? Good God, Dionisio. I put you through school and you end up with a hostess? She's like me. Living on the edge. Like us. No wonder she left you. Would she be a hostess if she had money? You're always getting into tight spots. You should've at least finished college before marrying. We're not married, Uncle. That doesn't solve your problem. You have to raise that child of yours. It's not cat shit that falls and gets covered in dirt. You young people! - I know that, Uncle. - Oh, really. What's to become of you and your kid? That's why I came to you. I know you'll help me. Don't worry, Uncle. I'll get a job. I've applied to the US Navy. You can keep the kid. I'll send you money every month. If you don't want to, I'll find someone else to raise my kid. First you make me your father, then your kid's mother. Dionisio, I only have one body. Don't expect me to grow tits. That's not a problem, Goring. I don't know anything about children. Never even had a brother to take care of. I'm an only child. I know nothing about kids. I didn't even take home economics in high school. I had no training in baby care. It's instinct. That's because you have a wife. All you need is patience. It's good to have a child. It's Calvary! That's what you get for pretending to be straight... when you're the mother superior of our gay order! Hypocrite! Don't out me, sweetheart... Admit it! Faggot! Oh, right. What's your name, dear? Binky. That's nice. Go buy ice cream and come back later. Toodles! Always picking on young boys. How old is he anyway? Fifteen. You know me, I like them fresh. Going back to the baby, you should adopt it. What! Think of the expense! Baby oil, baby powder, milk... You'll go crazy! All the money you spend on yourself will go to your grandson. That's right. I have to give it back. Look at your beauty parlor! It's falling apart. All you get are flies, and they don't get manicures, pedicures and perms. And what about our nights out? Blessed Virgin of Antipolo, I'd be giving up so much. You said it. You'll be wearing a housedress and playing mother. Get a babysitter from an agency. That's right. That's the solution. What are you saying? What you need is a nanny. That's right. Just because you make so much teaching literature... you expect him to pay for that child. I'll tell Dennis I can't do it. He'll have to give the child to someone else. Join us! Have a beer. Next time. Hey Goring, how's Dennis? I hear he's back. He's fine. So your husband is back. And you have a child. It's not my child. But I'll invite you all to the baptism. Hush, my baby. "Please look after my son." Dinner is served! Everybody to the table! Anyone notice how much work that child is? And I'm the only laundrywoman here. Washing diapers! I don't even do my boyfriend's laundry! That child is bringing us misfortune. If you believe that, then we girls bring misfortune. Maribeth. What? Maribeth. What a name. You finished the sixth grade? Yes. Then spell your name. M-A-R-E-B-E-T-H. What? M-A-R-E-B-E-T-H. M-A-R-A-B-A-T-H. No, T-H. Don't make my life difficult. Do you have an affinity with kids? Of course. Adults, even. Naughty girl. Okay, you're in charge. Don't let anyone in. I'll be coming home late often because I have so much work. Oki. What? Oki. Watch that mouth! How are you, Sir? What's going on? This is not For General Patronage! This is my friend-what's your name? Who told you to let this skeleton in? Get him out of here or I'll call the police. Don't let me catch you here again! So that's what you do when I'm away! Look after other children! He was just visiting. And he's much nicer than Baby Nonoy. Always laughing. Nonoy keeps crying when I tickle him. I could smack you. What happens now? What if you swell up like a balloon? Why would I swell up? Why don't you take a vacation in the province? Whatever you say. Go to sleep. I'll look after the baby. - Sir? - What? Sweet dreams. Tan! Dionisio, what have you done to me? What's that? Smells like shit? Why would I do that, it's so early? It stinks! Oh no. Nonoy, what have you done? And me with a customer to attend to. - Here, take him off me. - I'm not touching him, he stinks. Oh come on. I baptize you in the name of the Father... I've been waiting for ages. I've been looking for you all over. The baby and I went shopping. It's a miracle! You used to be such a hard worker. And all because of that... What was his name? Dennis. I'll never understand how Dionisio became Dennis. Where is he? He's away, working. How is everyone? What happened? Our house burned down. Everything went up in flames in an instant. You're so lucky to have a house like this. Here, have a coffee. At least you have your daughter. Milagros? That ungrateful wretch? Went off and married some American who took her abroad. She sends money, but I never see her anymore. Forgive her. America's so far away. I feel like an orphan. You're not an orphan. That baby is an orphan. Who's the father of this child? I am. Who's the mother? I am. He's your grandson. Are you crazy? Dioscoro, don't joke like that. How can you have a child when you don't like girls? I just wanted a child to keep me company. I'm all alone in the world. It's a good thing you're here. I need someone to look after the child. Hold him for a minute. I'm just going to the post office to pick up a package. I hope it's from Milagros. Wait a minute, have to look after the baby. Behave yourself. Bang! Bang! Come back here! Don't go out there, you could get run over. Your kid is so cute! He takes after you. I hope he stays a boy. I hope so, too. Ma'am, why don't you die? Naughty child! Come on. Stop that, your granny will scold you again. Oh no. She'll make me pull out her gray hairs. Then behave yourself. Yes, Sir. Dad? Why is her hair so high? Won't it get caught on something? Do you notice everything? Why do you insist on this hairstyle, it's so dated? It goes with my outfit. You'll look like a Roman centurion. Nonoy, what are you doing? Her hair is stuck. It's supposed to be stuck. Looks like a worm. Why don't you die? Godfather? Godfather! Excuse me darling, Godmother. Child, why don't you allow the gay to beautify in peace? What? If you don't understand, be quiet. I have no time to play with toy guns. If you want to play house or play with dolls, we can play for hours. But no war games. Go home. Do as I say. Wait, I left my toys. Go on home. I won't be naughty anymore. I'm not mad at you. Go play with the other kids, not in the beauty parlor. Okay, Dad. I'll be off. Careful, there's lots of cars. Don't talk to the child like that! You think he doesn't understand? Just don't do it. I don't want Nonoy talking like you. Talking like me? What am I, a freak? Ooh, listen to the straight man talk. You. Shut up. Look at the way you're dressed. What's wrong with this? I can see your nipples. It's summer fashion! I want you to dress like a man. A man! You can't find a male assistant! Look at you! A fag pretending to be straight! Bitch! You hit me! I'll put your eye out! You want to blind me! I can't bear it here anymore! I'm leaving! I have offers from other beauty parlors! What's happening here? Sit down and calm yourself. I nearly died of shock! I can't stay any longer! Don't complain. The ribbon is so cute. I don't like it. I said, the ribbon is pretty. There. You look like Shirley Temple. Who's that? A Pretty girl. Dad? What are you doing? If you want entertainment, watch TV. Don't do that to Nonoy. Take that off. Here, buy yourself some candy. Come on, Auntie. I take care of your child and you scold me. Why can't Milagros send me her child so I can take care of my real grandchild? I hear it's a pretty child. Milagros has a daughter. Nonoy is a boy. As if! When you were a child you loved ribbons in your hair. You're a boy. Nonoy is not like me. I'm a... Well, I don't want him to go through what I went through. Be quiet, I'm watching TV. Go to sleep, my child. The world is quiet. I'm always here for you. HI never leave your side. Dream here in my arms. Close your eyes. Rest your head against me. Go to sleep, my child. Dream beautiful dreams. Forget all sorrow. Stop it! You watch your kid! He started it! What were you doing? He hit me. Teach your child some discipline! You're going to get a spanking. Daddy, help me! You're not mad at me? Even if I got into a fight? I'm not happy about it. Avoid that child. I don't want you fighting. Your face is in Technicolor. He's always teasing me. Teasing you about what? Dad, what does gay mean? A man who acts like a woman. Like my godfather? Kind of like that. He said I was like that, because my father is a mother. I'm not like your godfather. Dad, is he lying? If that kid says it again, hit him. If Uncle Dennis were here, he could teach me boxing. Right, left. Right, left. Like that. Ow! Oh my God, what's this! That outfit! It's amazing! Goring, more color on my eyelids. You want to look like a cowboy? 0K5'! ' Here. You're the best. Thank you. I'll be back tomorrow. Who told you you could do that? Look at your face! Why did you do that? I was making an Indian face. Like this. Don't waste the materials. I won't do it again. Goring, look at you! You resemble a man! How are you? Speak? How are you guys? Oh my god. A man! We'll go ahead. Let's go, son. Son! My hair is standing on end! You have no dignity! That's why we-you- don't get any respect! Vampires! Vampire! Mark my word, I'll never go to your beauty parlor again! Coward! We invited you here so we could meet our students' parents. I am Mrs. Tobias. When I call the pupil's name, will the parents please stand up. Artiaga, Rowena. Your mother'? Claudio, Emily. My husband cannot make it today. He's abroad, you know. Derecho, Marlon Brando. Your mother and father? He's here. Dad? I'm his father. Mr. Derecho? Dioscoro Derecho. And his mother? I'm also his mother. Thank you for helping with my homework. Be careful walking home. You've been working so hard. Rest a bit. Just a little longer. He's left. God my body hurts from all that self-control. Where are our friends? I never see them anymore. They say you never pay attention to them. You've been snubbing them. They're preparing for a fashion show. Fashion show? It's been ages since I joined a fashion show. Why don't you join them? They're having it in the basketball court. Right on your street. You've changed so much. You're so masculine. You should break out once in a while. Come to think of it... If I didn't have a wife and kids, I'd go out with you three. Don't tempt me. A fish needs water or it'll die. Live a little. Go with Rodrigo and Bading. I might get caught. Nonoy won't find out. Well? Fabulous! What is that racket? It's coming from the basketball court. Must be a dance. Your father must've gone there. I heard him talking to his two slutty friends. Dad? Dancing? Yes. Dad can dance? Yes. With two left feet. Two left feet? Is that true? Do you think I'm a liar? Go to bed, it's late. Our next model is wearing chiffon with a bikini underneath! Next: A Victorian-inspired creation. Next: Casual wear. Our next model is wearing haute couture by Corina del Viva. Look who's here! Dad? Dad? Is Uncle Dioscoro here? My dad's at work. Your dad? You must be Nonoy. Are you Nonoy? Yes, Sir. You must not remember me. I'm your Uncle Dennis. I know who you are. How? Wait a minute. Where are you going? I'm getting something. Who is watching you? My granny, but she went out. Here. Isn't that you? Why didn't you look happy to see me? I was shy because I know you but I've never met you. Where's your father? He's at the beauty parlor. Come, I'll take you there. Later. What's wrong? Nothing. How tall is the child? This tall. More like this. The child is that tall? If he were standing on this desk. No, he's more like this. No, he's like this. Quiet! You sound like a bunch of hens. Behave. Did you bring a picture of the missing child? Who is the father of Marlon Brando, I mean, Marlon Brando Derecho? I am. You are? Is that true? Sister, don't be so doubtful. It's not that I'm doubtful, but... who's the mother? Don't look at me like that Kuya Germs, I'm a single... it's Ate Luds, I mean, Ate Luds. I'm a single girl. A virgin. Maybe the boy had a tantrum. Maybe he's with relatives. All his godparents are right here. Alright, you should address him yourself. Go ahead. Nonoy, my son, wherever you are, please come home. We've been looking for you all day. Come home, we beseech you. You know where we live. I told you to remember it just in case. Where have you been? It's late. Have you eaten? Dad? You little brat! We've searched for you all over the city! Where've you been? I nearly had a heart attack! Where have you been? Guess. Close your eyes. I'm exhausted from looking for you. Dennis. I bet Coring is screaming inside. He's playing demure. Sssh! A little respect for Dennis. How are you, Uncle? Dad, Uncle Dennis is speaking to you. I'm nearly died of fright. I know you got my letters because they weren't returned. I don't like writing letters. You know what I'm like. What do you want from me anyway? Nothing. What do you want from me? Why did you come here? Are you going to woo me again? Not likely. - Really? Are you sure? - Yes! After everything that happened? You abandoned me and the child as if... Watch your language! We're eating. We' re not in the slums of Pasay anymore. I know. You're classy now. Look at you, you're glittering with jewelry. I'm not some two-bit hostess anymore. We haven't seen each other in ages, do we have to fight? Sorry. I left you because I didn't want the three of us to starve to death. Now I can support four, ten people. I can support you now, I have money. Since we split up, I've been everywhere... but I choose to live in a decent life. I worked as waitress, I became a chambermaid. I worked in a factory somewhere in Pasig area. I was an usherette. Then I met a widower. No children. He was rich. Unfortunately, two years after we married... I was widowed. Bad luck. Turns out it's not that easy being rich... especially if you're alone. So I looked for you. What for? You know I'm over you. I was looking for you not for that... I was hoping to get my child back. Our child. Whatever. Our child. You're still a liar. You find me, but you can't locate my son? Our son, Dennis. Alright, Your son, my son. I didn't know where you put the kid. You just took off without leaving an address. Did you tell me where you were? By the way, what's with the sudden interest in the child? My goodness, Dennis. It's as simple as ABC and 1 plus 1. Whatever happened, I'm still his mother. Aside from being lonely, I just can't marry any guy. Now that I'm rich, I'm not going back to being a hostess. If I can't have you, I'll never marry someone else. And perhaps, I'll devote my life to our son. Too bad. I won't marry you in church or before a judge. Wait. Where is he? He? Oh, you mean Nonoy. He's with my Uncle Goring. When are you coming back? - I don't know. - I'll wait for you. Never mind. If our ship docks in the Philippines, I'll visit you. We'll eat out and ride the Ferris wheel. And take lots of pictures. I'll buy you lots of toys. Be a good student. Yes, and I won't annoy Dad and Granny. Good boy. Look after your Dad. You're a big boy now. Uncle. What's this? I don't want it. Please take it. I can't spend it anyway. It's for Nonoy. Uncle... thank you so much. Take care. Be careful. Go, the taxi's waiting. The ship might leave without you. Please tell Auntie Bebang I couldn't wait for her. Just as well she's not here, she'll make a scene. Be a good boy. Yes, Sir. Goodbye Uncle Dennis, come back again. Uncle Dennis! Uncle Dennis! Come back again! Uncle Dennis! Bye! See you! It's done. Fine. You got it just right. My friends said you were very good. Thank you, Ma'am. Just between us, I'm a widow. You look so young. I'll be coming here more often. I might even invest in your beauty parlor so you can fix it up. Bye, Sister! Thanks, come again! I'm sure you don't often come to seedy places like this. Such modesty! Not really. Ok, just call me Mary Ann. Thank you! I love gays like you! Well? I'm all bruised. She pinched me all over. But what a big tipper. This is from Tito Dennis. I can buy you a nicer one. Any time you want to go shopping, I'll take you. Put that toy away, it's time to eat. Here he is. Hey Goring! Mary Ann. Your guest has been waiting for you. She's the one I told you about. She wants to open a beauty parlor. Oh, really. I dropped by your shop, you weren't there. I dropped by Rodrigo's place. You kept your guest waiting. I don't mind. Nonoy kept me entertained. My son is such a bright boy. Sorry, I can't imagine... I can't imagine how you could give birth. What do you really want from me? Can we talk? Just the two of us? Just the two of us. Auntie, could you leave us for a while? How did you find out where I live? I've known for a while. I've known about you for a long time. How do you know me? From Dennis. The father of the boy. I'm Mariana. Let's drop the act. What do you want? Nonoy. How much do you want for him? Wow. You have a lot of nerve. What? What gall! You think you can buy anyone? It's your choice. You might regret this. Get out. Don't come back. Bitch! What time was she here? Just before I went to pick Nonoy up from school. What did she say? She's inviting you to her house to talk. She mentioned a lawsuit. That woman has some nerve. Not that I'm taking her side... just like me, she's also a mother. Whatever you think she is, she feels for her son. Look at me. I'm angry with Milagros but I love her. Maybe Mariana wants to make up for lost time. She can do it now. That's life. Of course you're angry. You've given up so much for the boy. But the boy won't be a child forever. What'll happen when he grows up... when we're both gone? You mean when we're dead. With Mariana he has security even after we're gone. You can't really count on Dennis. Think about it, Goring. I'm going to bed. Go to sleep, my child The world is quiet I'm always here for you HI never leave your side Dream here in my arms Close your eyes Rest your head against me Go to sleep, my child Dream beautiful dreams Forget all sorrow Have a seat, I'll call her. Remember my summer wardrobe. Goring! Have you been here long? A few minutes. This is Sabrina, my personal stylist. Hello. Who is he? He's a hairstylist, too. He makes wigs and false eyelashes. He has a parlor-where? On Timog Avenue. Where's that? Near Repose, turn right on Calle Troso, there's a waterpump in front... then a dog on a leash and a man selling snails. There. I don't know where that is. I'm from Greenhills. I'm leaving. Sunday, don't forget the opening of my new shop on Mabini. All the beauty queens will be there! Please set a plate for Goring. Sit down. You live here by yourself? Yes. It's lonely, but I have a battalion of servants. Sometimes I have friends over. But I don't have many friends. I envy you. Your home is full of friends. My parents left me that house. When Nonoy is living here, I hope you'll visit us. Mariana, I have one request. What is it? I can afford it. Not money. I'm sorry. Please don't take him from me now. It'll shock the boy. Let him slowly get used to the idea. Sure. That's a good idea. Can I visit him so he'll get used to me? Don't worry, I'm sure my son will enjoy living with me. I mean our son. Yours and mine and Dennis'. Go! Turn off the TV Nonoy! We'll going to eat. I said, turn that off! That's enough! Be quiet! Eat! - Don't yell at the boy. - Don't interfere! Where are you going? - I lost my appetite. - Come here! Sit down! But I used to be able to watch TV. - Yes, he was allowed- - Nobody speaks! Then nobody speaks. Nonoy, don't speak. From now on, we all eat together. When it's time to eat, no TV! Eat! You! I've been calling you for hours! I'm just showing them my pet lovebird. It's early in the morning and you're playing with your pet. Go home now! Why are you angry? I'm not angry! You'll get run over! Have you eaten? Not yet. Go home! What are you staring at? You wanna get smacked? Dad? What? Can I have some money? What for? I'm buying birdseed. Go away, I'm busy. Please, Dad? I said, go away. Out! What are you doing there? I told you to go home! Get up! Take this! We can visit him any time, so there's no problem. But maybe it's best we don't see him. Especially you. It's all about luck. Her good luck is my misfortune. Why did you have to meet that Dennis? He's going around the world, having a good time. Leaving us his responsibilities. Don't go blaming him. It's my fault, too. I should've listened to you and my friends. Does this go in the bag too? I don't want to see any of his things. Give the rest to charity. You keep yakking! Dioscoro, keep your bad mood to yourself. Watch your blood pressure. You give the child to its mother, and then you get mad at me. You whip the ox, but the horse gets the lash. I'm not angry with your grandmother. I know you're angry with me because you're always yelling at me. Get away. What did I do? From now on no one will scold you. No one will yell at you or spank you. You can watch TV all you want. Buy all the clothes and shoes. Live in a nice, big house. Eat good food. Ride an airplane. We'll live apart. You understand? No, Sir. You won't live here anymore. You're leaving. I don't want to go. Even if she's my real mother. I'm not giving you away like a kitten. I'm just entrusting you to her. Please don't make me go! We'll have lunch, then have siesta. Then we'll go shopping. This is your room. Do you like it? From now on, you don't have to live with those crazy gays anymore. Kiss Mommy. I guess you have to get used to me. But don't cry, okay? I'll call you when lunch is served. Yes, Ma'am. I'm losing. I'm having a run of bad luck. Nita! There's something in the bathroom! What do you mean, you don't know? Maybe Nonoy put it there. Nonoy, come here. - Did you go to my room? - Yes, Ma'am. What is that? It's a turtle. My friend gave it to me. Get rid of it! It doesn't bite. What do you think my bathroom is, a zoo? Nita, give him a bath. Wash his hands. From now on, don't go inside my room. I told you to throw that away! Give him a bath! You're giving me a headache! Go to sleep, my child The world is quiet I'm always here for you HI never leave your side Dream here in my arms Close your eyes Rest your head against me Go to sleep, my child Dream beautiful dreams Forget all sorrow Why won't you eat anything? I'm still full. Why don't you believe me? You didn't eat your lunch either. You gave it to the bird. You left your snack untouched. I'm not hungry. Nonoy. Yes, Ma'am. You're being a brat. I'm losing my patience. Eat that. Are you “Wing? Eat that! If those faggots allowed you to behave like that, I won't. Go to your room before I smack you! And now, the finalists for Miss World Eternal 1978! Our criteria: beauty, intelligence, and contribution to society! We're cutting the program short due to impending bad weather. Here's Miss Aruba! If your father and your boyfriend are both drowning... and you can only rescue one, who would you save? Come again, please. If your father and your boyfriend are both drowning... and you can only rescue one, who would you save? It's like this. Like what? I love my father very much, even if he used to beat me up. It's like this. Hurry up, or we'll get caught in the rain. It's like this. Why are you hurrying? You're ruining my composure. It's like this. Who will you save? Even if I love my father, it's like this. Even if I owe him my life and I'm now a successful hairdresser... I would save my boyfriend. Thank you very much. Now, Miss Philippines! If you are given a choice to be a bird, what kind of bird would you like to be? Please repeat the question. If you are given a choice to be a bird, what kind of bird would you like to be? What I mean is, please repeat the question in Filipino. If you are going to be a bird, what kind of bird are you? - What bird are you? - Ah, a butterfly. Next, Miss Spain! Oye, chicas. Buenas Noches Damas De Caballeros. Have you ever been ashamed of what you are? I've been this way since I was a child. Teased everywhere I went. On one hand, getting smacked and scolded by my father... on the other hand being pinched and cursed by my mother. That's life. I did nothing wrong. Didn't hurt my fellow man. Behaved well. I don't understand why I'm treated like this. All I know is, I'm weak. Sometimes I have strong self-control. I don't mistreat others or break the law. I fear God. I don't know. What hurts is that my sisters and I are human, too. We laugh. We CW- I'm trying hard to do something about myself. Why... Should I be ashamed? It's raining! Dad, what happened to you? How did you get here? You taught me how to get home if I was lost. Why are you here? Dad, I don't like it there. I want to live here. If she comes to get me tomorrow, I'll come back here. If she gets me again, I'll come back here. She said my real father is Uncle Dennis. I want to live here, Dad. Dad? Mom?
