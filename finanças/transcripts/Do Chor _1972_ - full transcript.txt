Who is it? Narayan! Shankar! Kalva! Deewa! Did you hear any noise? -No. -No. Where did that noise come from? The door's locked. Seems to be a thief in the house. -Thief! -Thief! Open the door! -Thief! -Thief, get out! -Thief! -Thief! Hello. Police station? This is Gopichand. There's been a robbery in my house. Yes. Come fast. Yes, fast. Where did the theft take place? Come inside, I'll show you the place. -What is being stolen? -Only a necklace is stolen. It was placed in this box. -Is this yours? -No. You've read the newspapers, haven't you? They're praising us so much! You're unable to catch a mere thief? He's not an ordinary thief, sir. He leaves only a sign of swastika, and no other clues. He's very smart. Are we stupid? On one hand the thief is alone... ...and on the other is the entire police force of Bombay. -We're trying our best. -But the result is zero. If the press continues this uproar... ...it will be difficult for us to survive in this city. Do this. Go to the area where this robbery took place... ...and get hold of all the thieves working in that area. Yes, sir. Tony, where did you steal this necklace from? Darling, this is not a necklace, it is my success. Oh... When did you start reciting poems besides stealing? Basically, every thief is a poet. If you're so fond of it, write the lyrics for movie songs. Am I such an ordinary thief? Tony reaches places where people don't even think about. Every party or function of this city... ...is dull without the presence of Tony. Agreed that the party is good and youthful. But if Tony is not there, it's worthless. -I've fallen for this style of yours. -Really? What happened? -The police officers have come. -Police officers? Since when did the police officers start coming here? They haven't come for me, they've come for you. -For me? -Yes. -Sure? -Yes. They don't let me rest. Inspector, you? Why did you bother to come over? You could have sent someone, I would have come. -This is a special invitation. -Special? The commissioner has called you. The commissioner? Tony, looks like your fate is changing. Earlier the constables used to call me. Now the commissioner calls me. Let's go sir, I am ready. TONI: This is really too much, sir. I've been called for the third time in this week. You don't let the decent people work peacefully. You can go. Can I sit? Mr. Tony, do you know this mark? Yes, sir. I know this symbol. Whose symbol is it? Sir, it is the symbol of Hitler from Germany. Tony, I am not asking you about politics, but about this thief. Sir, that man used to rob big countries... ...and this thief steals from small safes. They both have the same symbols. So you don't know anything about this robbery? No, I know nothing. Where were you last night? Sir, I am not some lamp post, which would stand at one place. I run a business. I keep travelling for that. Tell me the exact time. What were you doing yesterday night at 11 o'clock? I was watching a movie in the Super Cinema at 11 o'clock. See these tickets. -And at 12:30? -At 12:30 I was there where the theft took place. I mean I was in the area of that robbery. -What were you doing there? -Well... What's the matter? Tell me where you were? I feel shy, commissioner. Were you at some dancer's place? What's there to feel shy about? Even the famous, decent people go to her. Were you at some prostitute's place? It is a matter of manliness. Were you at some liquor bar? No, I haven't started taking hemp yet. Neither here, nor there. Where were you then? Were you at some thieves club that you are ashamed to name? You got it, commissioner! It was just the thieves club. There were thieves, pick pockets... -...and wicked people all around. -Shut up! Tell me the name of that place. Lamington Road police station. -Are you telling the truth? -You can call them up and ask. You can go. -You thief! Rascal! Goon! -They smashed me. You raid, you break the law. When you get a good thrashing... ...you come to a physician. It's okay now. It's fine. I'll put on the plaster. Done. This is the way out. Take a peg of liquor and you'll be fine. Now get lost! Look, if you get into any mess next time... ...I will break one of your legs. No doctor of Bombay would be able to fix it. Uncle, it's not our fault. We got in this trouble because of Tony. That rascal is also a goon. But behaves like a gentleman. Gentleman! He turned out to be a cheater. He took away all the benefit. He steals with our help... ...but takes away all the goods himself. Morally very bad. One must show decency in illegal tasks, too. Let Tony come over. Hi, uncle. Okay, okay, I'll get one for you. Cheers! -Cheater! -What did you say? Say that again. It wasn't you who stole at Gopichand's place, right? I see. So that's the matter? That's why everyone looks so upset. I haven't done this robbery. This is not a police station where one has to lie. Who is lying? I made the duplicate safe keys for you. You got the car from him. The robbery took place. But you didn't do it. Look, Tony, we've been working together till date. We've equally shared the goods. This is the first time that... ...you're thinking of taking all the loot away. This is not possible. Oh dear... Stop it! Look, brothers, don't fight. I can't repair more bones. Uncle, tell Tony to give us our share... ...and the quarrel will be over. You all are nuts. Why would I take only one necklace from there? Couldn't I clear up the whole safe? Then, then who did this robbery? That's what we should find out. Till the thief with the swastika is found out... ...we'll be called to the police station every week. And neither shall we get over this bickering. I said, greetings. Oh! It's you. I thought it's someone else. I heard a robbery took place at your house. So I've come to meet you. God saved me, only one piece or jewellery was stolen. And that, too, I had bought in an auction. Thank God. A wretch gets the goods of a thief! What did you say? I mean one piece of jewellery does not make a difference to you. Yes, that's right. I was worried about my wedding. Marriage? You've taken so much money from me by the excuse of marriage. You won't yet a penny now. Get out from here. Get out. Why are you shouting? You want me to go to the police, show them the papers... ...then you would beg to me? -Take out the money. Jalebi is standing outside. -Jalebi? My new girlfriend. Her real name is Vaiiayanti. But she is very pretty and sweet like a Jalebi. Call her inside, I'll get the money. Jalebi! Shucks! Shucks! Where did this stale fries come from? Hey Trikamdas, you? How come... Jalebi! Trikamdas, where is the fish fry you had last year? She fried me and went away. You are lucky. I've been surviving on the stale curry for years now. Take my advice and throw that curry out. Then you will have Tandoori chicken, fish fry, Jalebi... Trikamdas, I cannot behave like you. I am a prestigious man. I know that. Your prestige is in my hands. Take this and get lost from here. Never come back again. Mr. Gopichand, you might think that I'm a blackmailer... -...but I am an honest man. -Stop blabbering. You can give me bad words after giving the money. Okay, I'll leave now. Don't know, when I'll get rid of him. God can't tell that either. Okay, tell me something. I heard that the thief... -...left the mark of a swastika after stealing. -Yes. Looks like the thief is changing his move. Listen. Did you see what the newspaper mentioned? Keep the newspaper down and look at this. Our next victim. Hey, this is Mr. Charandas. The next theft will be done here. But there is a small problem. We will solve it by going to his house. But, when will this be done? At the day of his daughter's marriage. Please don't do this mistake. There will be a big crowd. I fear getting caught. Ramcharan, the smart thieves are those... ...who commit daylight robbery in front of our society. Such thieves never get caught. This is Charandas's house. And this is the corridor. -Is Mr. Charandas inside? -Yes, he's inside. -Give this card to him. -Okay, sit inside. I will call him. Sorry, you have come at the wrong time. My wife and daughter are not at home. Women need to look in to clothes and jewellery. But it needs the insight of men. And you must have shopped for lakhs... You're the first girl who thinks of me this way. What's the need to differentiate? You have to make out beauty. If am not wrong then... ...you must not have missed this. If you permit, shall I you show some things. Yes, of course. How's the dress I have worn? How's it? It's very good. Now look at this. Its design has changed. First it looked like a lungi . Now this has become a skirt. Your daughter will wear a lungi in India. And skirt abroad. Two dresses in one. Wow! Then I will save money. There are many latest designs. Would you like to see some jewellery designs? Yes, certainly. See this. This is Hyderabad style necklace. And then... This is Jaipur style necklace. See this. See this. Yes. This is a special necklace. Oh my God! What happened? We have the same one in our house. This is not possible. This is my own design. If you don't believe it, then I can show you. -Why are you taking the trouble? -There's no trouble. I will bring it right away. I mean... ...if I come with you, then you won't have to come down. But my bedroom is upstairs. So, what? I have come to do my work. Be it bedroom or here. I have no problem. But if you have any problem, then... It's nothing like that. Come. Let's go. -Sir! -Yes. Your house is really amazing. It was made long ago. You don't find such houses nowadays. Come. See this. Did I say anything wrong? Oh! Oh my God! It's identical. Where had you seen it? What shall I tell you? I had seen this in my dream. In your dream? It's strange! Our necklace came in your dream. Tomorrow I may come in your dreams. Sir, you are a very interesting person. Oh God! Here, sir. Your key. May I take your leave now? What's the hurry? Have a cup of tea. Not today. I will make your designs in a couple of days. Bye! Ramcharan, make 3 to 4 keys of this design. It should be identical. All right. -Greetings, uncle. -Greetings, you are late. Sunaina is waiting for you. -Sorry, uncle. -It's okay. Go. Oh God! -Thank you. -It's all right. -I hope you are not hurt? -No. She's in this room? Yes sir... No, not in this room. In that room. That's it. Only one jewellery? Shall I help you? God knows what was in the betel leaf. Spit it out. It will become all right. Hey, who's standing there? There's no one here. Such swindling in the morning. Bharti. Had anyone come in this room? No one had come. We were here. Why? Nothing. What's the matter? Nothing! The necklace that I had kept for Surekha has been stolen. Oh God! Finding a way to go out. No, an opportunity. Hello, police. I am Charandas. -Hello, inspector. -Hello. What's the matter? Our family necklace has been stolen. And he has left this sign of swastika here. -The sign of swastika. -Yes. Your house or will you come to my house? Why? Because the world works on account. Account? What kind of account? The account of the necklace that's in your pocket. What do you mean? I mean that if I had not come, then you would have been caught. Not necessary. If you had not come, then that would have been mine. Perhaps you would have gotten caught. That's why I am saying, settle the account. How? It's simple. Half of it. 50-50. No. 'Santacruz Police Station' Get anything? Little bit. It's not safe to stay here. It's not safe to go from here without settling the account. Say it. 50-50. It's more. The time is not conducive. I agree. But move from here. Where will we meet? You say it. Tomorrow at 2 o'clock. Kamla Nehru park. I will be there. Thank you. You are still am amateur. Why? If you had refused, still I wouldn't have taken... ...you to the police station. I know. After all, you had saved me. You deserve a part of it. Mr. Honest Swastika. My name is Bob. Real or fake? Fake. And my name is Tony. Real name. Drop me here. You stay here? Yes, why? It doesn't look like a thief colony. A high rise building. A thief, who goes high, stays in a high rise building. Thank you, Mr. Swastik. What happened? Any bad news? You forgot something? No, you forgot something. Two decent persons can deceive each other. But two thieves can never deceive each other. That's why I came to return your keys. Thank you. Just a moment. I hope you remember where to meet. It's a very simple way. You don't need a map till there. Bye-bye. See you tomorrow. Who was he? He was also a thief. He had come to steal the necklace. But I stole it. This is the same one. I find that man dangerous. Those who seem dangerous need not be dangerous. But he's very cunning and sly. And I know that he will follow me wherever I go. That's why I will have to settle his account one day. How's that? Leave it to me. Here. And vanish it like always. Ramcharan, wait. Don't burn the clothes. Why? I have got a brilliant idea. Tell me, what's your relation with Gopichand? Relation? There's no relation? Commissioner, we are friends. We just know each other. Do you have any enemies? Enemies? But what made you think so? Because that thief is not an ordinary one. If that thief was an ordinary one... ...then the thief would have taken the other jewellery too. Tell me if there's an old secret. Get me? It would be easy to catch the thief. Secret? There's no secret. Then I would like to take your leave. Sorry. 37. -Whom do you want to meet? -Doesn't Mr. Bob stay here? Yes. But he's gone out of Bombay. Out of Bombay? Did he leave a message? No, he didn't say anything to me. He must have told the servant. I will ask him. Please come in. Thank you very much. Have a seat. -Ramcharan. -Yes, ma'am. Yes? Ramcharan, did brother leave any message for him? You are... I am Tony. No, there is no message for any Tony or Phony. He told that a cobbler would come. Give him 7 bucks and take the shoes. Yes, I was a cobbler in my childhood. I have repaired many big things. Nowadays I only polish off things. Sorry. Don't mind his words. And by the way, one can't say who's what. They are something else. And they show off something else. You think whatever you want to think about me. Just tell me, when can I meet your brother. You can never tell about his appointments. The pharmaceutical company he works in... ...never lets him rest for a moment. Tell me, since when do you know my brother? I have known him since a couple of months. A friend had introduced him to me. What do you do? The same thing which your brother does. Okay. You work in a pharmaceutical company? Yes, medicine, medicine. Then I will leave now. -I will meet Bob when he comes back. -Okay. Thank you so much. Greetings, Mr. Charandas. Greetings! You didn't invite me for the marriage. But I have come to invite you for my marriage. Last time you were going to marry some jalebi? -Yes, I was going to marry her. -But that Jalebi got cold. So I am marrying this Chicken rice. Chicken rice! Your mouth is watering! But you are a vegetarian. You won't be able to digest this. Trikamdas, your first girlfriend's name was fish fry. The second one was Jalebi. And now this chicken rice. Seems like you are the son of a cook. No, I put names after tasting everything. Okay, then bye. I have to go to the police station. Even I have to take you to the police station. What do you mean? I am talking about the thing which... ...I have hidden in the cupboard. Trikamdas, for how long will you blackmail us? Till it's written in your destiny. What can I say? How much do you want? It's fine if you give me 10 grand for now. Wait right here. I will be back. Did you see? Everyone takes out clarified butter from butter. I take it out with such ease. Miss. Sandhya, your mail. Thank you. Excuse me. It's you? My job is to reach the wrong place at the wrong time. What are you doing here? I work here. What are you doing here? I had come to meet your manager. Now that I have met you... ...there's no need to meet the manager. I will talk to you. Let's go. Tell me, what can I do for you? Are all these done by you? Yes, these are all my work. I am the art director of this company. Both brother and sister are good at using hands. What? It seems like a family inheritance. I knew your brother's talent. But your work has convinced me that... ...art has been running in your family blood. You haven't told why you're here? Is it true that there can be hair on a bald man... ...lean man can gain weight and a fat person can lose weight. Our work has nothing to do with truth or falsehood. But to give ads according to our customer. So you deceive people. What's your work here? Work, work, work. My work is done if I have a few words with you. I know very well why you are here. You have come to see where I work. And you might want to meet Bob too. Caught you red-handed. Ma'am, if I had to meet Bob... ...then I would have gone home and not come here. I saw you, so I came to have a chat. If you are upset, then I will meet the manager. He will send you to me. Tell me, what's your ad? I am opening a new company with your brother. With Bob? Yes. But he didn't mention anything to me. It seems your brother hides many things from you. But what will you manufacture? Your brother knows that. His brain works in a different style. He's only 5ft 21/2 inches. But his schemes are so long sighted... ...that you either in or out. What? I mean either money in or out. Your brother is amazing. He will go very high. Where will the investment come from? There's no need for investment. A little intellect. Some tricks. And your company is on ground. Just make an ad quickly. I won't be able to understand anything what you say. Let Bob come. I will know it from him. It's all right. I am not in a hurry too. I will take your leave. Sir, we have come to know about 20 years ago... ...there was a company called Swastika enterprises, doing export import on Babulnath road. The name of the proprietor was Vikram Singh. Charandas was an accountant there. Gopichand was an ordinary clerk... ...and Bhagwandas was the manager. And Goa's businessman Tribhuvan Singh... ...was the General manager there. The company was auctioned after the death of Vìkram Sìngh. But what has all this to do with the swastika thief? Sir, all the people on whose houses the theft took place... ...were all working for Swastika enterprises at one time. There's a big mystery behind this. I think you are on the right track. Go ahead. -Don't try to be smart. -What? I know that you are involved with your brother... ...and you are trying to fool me. You have misunderstood me. I am myself worried about Bob. Our parents passed away when we were children. And we became orphans. I brought up Bob. But he got out of control when he grew up. After all I am girl. How long can I control him? Ms. Sandhya, don't cry. Give that necklace to me... Wouldn't I have given the necklace if it was with me? Why would I keep it? All right. If Bob doesn't come by tomorrow. I won't be responsible for the consequences. So, you have finally come? How did you you find my address? Just like the way you found mine? Don't try to be too smart. Where are you coming from? That's none of your concern. Only be concerned of your money. All right. Then take out the money. Take it from my sister. Why? Why from your sister? Why did you go to my sister? I don't let my sister know anything about me. You had not kept your promise. I had not broken it either. I had gone to get the money. Did you get the money? No. It's not easy to get the money. And that too for an amateur thief like me. But I won't be able to wait for long. I want the money right away. Great! You are talking as if I own a bank. I will give it you when I get it. Listen Bob, don't infuriate me. If you don't have the money... ...then you will have to join my plan. No. I don't join other's plan. You scum! Neither do you give the money nor are you ready to join my plan. What do you think of yourself? Don't try to threaten me. I don't get scared easily. I will smash your bones! -One thing can be done. -What? First let go of my collar. I have one plan. If you want you can... Be it your plan or mine, we will work together. But only for once. That we will decide later. -Then is it a deal? -It's a deal. Let's shake hands for that. Then let's have something to celebrate. What? What? Don't behave like you're innocent. Like you know nothing. Come with me. Is this good? It's very good. You will lose your senses as soon as you drink it. O dear, welcome. Why are you standing there? Come in. I won't come in. Why are you talking like a girl? Come in. Come in, king. TONY: I won't come in. JAGGU: Great! Hey, who is this handsome face? A new companion! Shut up! He is my new friend. Why? Did you have a fall out with Chameli? He has brought him to make Chameli feel jealous? What a move? Mate, why is he blushing? Is his name Blusher? He's new in Bombay. Let him open out a little. Then he will beat you to the end. Why are you quiet? They will scare you more if you get scared this way. But no need to be scared. These are all my friends. TONY: This Jaggu opens locks like it's a child's play. This Badru is a smart mechanic. He can make any car start. This Kalia walks on pipes like a monkey. TONY: He is Ali baba. -He breaks everything... -But doesn't break the law. Amazing! Who is he? He's my new friend. How did you find him? He's good. It seems like you forgot your drape at home. Wonderful! I feel like I am sitting in my sister's lap. "My little..." "My little lover doesn't know love." "My little! Oh my little..." "Oh my little lover doesn't know love." "Oh my little lover doesn't know love." "Oh my little lover doesn't know love." "Oh my little..." "On the sly from everyone I go on the terrace with him." "He leaves my drape and starts flying kites." "On the sly from everyone I go on the terrace with him." "He leaves my drape and starts flying kites." "How can he know that the heart stops when one looks eye to eye." "My little! Oh my little..." "Oh my little lover doesn't know love." "Oh my little lover doesn't know love." "Oh my little..." "When the time came for fun and games, he went to sleep turning on the other side." "Seeing this, my heart burns and I don't get sleep." "When the time came for fun and games, he went to sleep turning on the other side." "Seeing this, my heart burns and I don't get sleep." "Only I know how I bear with it." "My little! Oh my little..." "Oh my little lover doesn't know love." "Oh my little lover doesn't know love." "Oh my little..." "I m walking in this beautiful moonlight..." "I am walking..." You fool! Why didn't you say that there's a dog in this house? I... He's out for half an hour. -Where's the bedroom? -There. "I'm walking in this beautiful moonlight." The fatso is turning. Hey, don't look at such things in this age. Hey, this happens in every bedroom. Now open it. God bless this couple. May you earn in millions! But remember our share in it. Good night. Put the swastika sign here. Put the swastika sign here. It seems like your chloroform didn't do its trick. This doesn't work for long. Come with me. Thief! Thief! Catch the thief! Thief! Thief! Catch the thief! Why are you staring at me like that? I have heard that doctors in Europe... ...change the sex of boys and girls. But this is the first time I'm seeing some ones sex change so fast. You were a boy when you went out. When you came back you are a girl. God knows what you will become tomorrow. Who knows about a thief's tomorrow? Complete today's work. Have a seat. Here are the two halves of the loot. Pick the one you like. You have the first choice. Why? Ladies first. That's it? That's it. Everything else is yours. I don't want anything more. Why? Because I took the thing that I liked. Ms. Sandhya, you are certainly hiding something from me. Because I never expected this from an educated girl like you. This is only for guys like us. Girls should only steal hearts. Nowadays guys don't have hearts. And girls don't have fidelity. That's why I steal only jewellery. But there might be some reason behind this. No, this is just my hobby. But there is one thing. I had agreed to steal with you only once. This won't happen a second time. I hope you don't defame me. If two thieves don't deceive each other... ...then they don't hide any secret from each other. So tell me the secret behind stealing only one necklace. No, I can't tell this to anyone. Not even to the police? What do you mean? You will go to the police? What do you want? I don't want to be caught with all these jewelleries? And I don't want to spend my life in jail. So tell me the truth. Or else I can do anything. If this is the thing, then listen. All these jewelleries which I am stealing one by one... ...all belong to my mother. She had kept it for my marriage. So this is not a theft. They are really mine. And from whom I have taken it... ...Charandas and Bhagwandas worked for my father. And he is Tribhuvandas. My uncle. After my father's death all these people... ...tricked my innocent mother to sign many papers. Our house got auctioned because of it. We lost everything. The house that Charandas is living was our bungalow. After losing everything my mother went to Kanpur. There she worked very hard. She brought me up with great difficulty. She educated me. But I didn't understand one thing. Whenever I asked about my father, she would keep quiet... ...and she would get scared. But this doubt kept growing that... ...this silence was somewhat related to my birth. But before a few days. Shut up! You call me a lewd woman! You abuse me! You abuse your own mother! You don't know. I have faced great hardships to save you from those barbarians. I wandered everywhere. I gave up my life for you. You are fooling me to hide your wrong deed. I know why you are not telling me my father's name. Because I had no father. Not me, but perhaps even you don't know my father's name. -Daughter? -Whose daughter? She's not my mother. She's my enemy. She's a lewd woman. Mother, do you know everyone has been calling me bastard... ...for the past 10 years. Bastard. For the past 10 years, mother. For the past 10 years. 10 years. Which 10 years? The same 1O years during which I have been abused by people mother. Mother? Whose mother? Whose daughter? My daughter was killed by those four butchers! SCREAMING -MRS. VIKRAM SINGH: Ramcharan... Ramcharan... -Yes. I am coming. MRS. VIKRAM SINGH: Let's go from here. They want to take my child. -They want to kill my child. -Who? Where? MRS. VIKRAM SINGH: There. Near the window. -Where will you go so late at night? -No. We will go in the morning. MRS. VIKRAM SINGH: No I don't want to stay here for a moment. Okay ma'am, I will guard under the window till morning. Stop! They are taking my child away. Catch them. -SANDHYA: Mother! -MRS. VIKRAM SINGH: Stop them. -They will kill my child. -Mother! I am her enemy. I am her enemy! I am a lewd woman. Everything will be all right. Don't worry. There he is. Catch him. He's taking away my diamond necklace. He's taking away my child's jewellery. Tribhuvan is taking my worship idol. Catch him. Tribhuvan is taking my worship idol. Catch him. Everything has been ruined. They killed my daughter! Uncle! Don't lose hope! That's why I am doing this. All right, this is the reason. Ms. Sandhya, I will take this jewellery. Or else you might get caught. But what if you get caught? Don't worry about me. This is my job. This bracelet, this bracelet is mine. This belongs to my child. This belongs to Sandhya. Sandhya, my child. Don't cry, mother. Please don't cry. I have a good job because of your blessings. I haven even bought a small house. Then why have you kept me here? Take me with you... I will take you with me, mother. Beware! This is our bracelet! This is ours! SANDHYA: Yes, mother. This is ours. I am Sandhya. Mother! Mother! I am her enemy! I am a lewd woman! My worship idol is being taken away. Don't lose hope, Ms. Sandhya. That was a shock to her! She will become all right. But there's one thing. Your mother came in to senses for sometime... ...after seeing this bracelet. I believe that if such old things are shown to her... ...then she will become all right soon. Doctor, I will try. I will try. What's this noise? Who's there? Why are you shouting in the dead of the night? -Did you hear something? -I did not... ...you must be imagining things. Bhagwanti, we should sleep with the lights on. The thieves have marked our house. What's left in the house that will be stolen? Take the name of God and go to sleep or go to... No, no. Don't go anywhere. I am scared. I will sleep here. I will sleep. Mother Goddess! Oh please shut up! O Durga Goddess! I am dead! -I am ruined! -What happened? Someone threw in a bomb to kill me. -Where is the bomb? -Look, it's over there. Hello, police station. Ramu, Gopal, Girdhari! Don't shout. The police is coming. The bomb will go off by the time the police comes. We will all die. Let's run away from here. Ramu, Gopal, Girdhari! Where are you all? Sir, what happened? What happened! Look over there. It is a small box. Even I know that's a small box. But what's inside it? Shall I take a look? No way. Don't touch it. We will all die. Let's run away from here. Let's run. -Sir, what's the matter? -Run. Someone threw in a bomb in my room. -Show it to me. -I will have to show it. Come here. Mother Goddess! Where is it? There it is. Constable, go take a look. Sakharam, go for it. Why are you hell bent on killing me? Sakharam! Oh God! Oh God! God! Mother Goddess! Mother Durga! My jewellery! These are all my jewellery. Strange thief. Steals it and then returns it. I don't know anything. I won't tell anything. -Oh my God! -These are all the jewelleries. -But one necklace is missing. -Which one? Vikram Singh's. Vikram Singh's? I had bought it in an auction. -Isn't it, Bhagwanti? -It's fine. Did you hear? Tony has returned all of Bhagwandas's jewellery. Bhagwanti, where are you? Why are you shouting? I am here. Why are you shouting out my name all the time? What's it? Will the police catch us now? What rubbish are you talking? Theft took place in our house and police will catch us! This has happened all because of you. You want jewellery, ornaments, a house. Then which wife doesn't want jewellery and house? I too wanted the jewellery that Vikram Singh's wife had. But I have to face the consequences now. I think instead of investigating the history of Swastika enterprises... ...we should have contacted Bhagwandas. -We made a mistake. -Okay, this is history now. I think Tribhuvandas will be the next victim. I agree, sir. I think you must go to Goa and contact him. Would you like to take a lift? Come. Have a seat. We had decided last time that we will never meet again. That was business. This is a matter of the heart. Better go from here. I don't want to meet you. The one who doesn't love goes to the dust. O my beloved, you get lovers with great difficulty. "O my beloved. O my beloved." "Listen to me." "O my beloved. O my beloved." "Listen to me." "The world is our adversary." "Understand this." "This journey won't be complete without a consort." "Then why don't you be mine." "O my beloved. O my beloved." "Listen to me." "No car in the world works on one wheel." "You can't live without a support." "Even your anklet doesn't click with one bell." "Two hands are required to clap." "Come with me. Don't mind." "O my beloved. O my beloved." "Listen to me." "The world is our adversary." "Understand this." "I am not inferior to you." "If you don't come with me..." "...then there are others to hold my hands." "I will make you laugh." "I will make your lips talk." "Understand that I am the thief of the hearts too." "Understand me just like you." "O my beloved. O my beloved." "Listen to me." "The world is our adversary." "Understand this." "This journey won't be complete without a consort." "Then why don't you be mine." "O my beloved. O my beloved." "Listen to me." I am Tribhuvan Singh. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Thank you. What is the matter? We have come here regarding the swastika robberies. Yes, tell me. You must have heard about these robberies? No, I have read about them in the newspapers. Gopichand, Charandas or Bhagwandas you didn't meet them? I didn't understand. The robberies are taking place in those houses... ...who worked in Swastika enterprises. The jewelleries which were auctioned... ...after the closing down of Vikram Singh's company, they are getting stolen. Strange! This didn't strike me. Because the thief hasn't come to your house. I am fortunate in this matter. Till now. Tomorrow it can happen here too. Only the thief knows it. The police too. Mr. Tribhunadas, we are thinking that instead of waiting... ...for the thief to strike, we can bring the thief, wherever we want. How's that possible? That's why we have come here. -We want to help you. -What help? You must be having some jewellery that was auctioned. You want to make me a scapegoat? No, that's not it. That's the only way to catch the thief. Well, very well. But I don't have any jewellery. But I have a statue of God Vishnu. Can you show it to us? I will bring it right away. It's a very old and beautiful design. But will the thief come to take this statue? Yes, certainly. It should not happen that thief escapes with this statue. No way. But we are making such a plan that... ...we will get the thief and you won't loose this statue. -Then, it's okay. -Thank you very much. We will come to meet you again. Sit down. I am sorry about this, Miss Sandhya. But Woolen mills has rejected all of your designs. I don't understand why would they not like such beautiful designs? Sir, have you seen our models carefully? They all look like monkeys. Only a tail is missing. I also had the same doubt. So I have brought such a model... ...which will make you jump to your feet. You! I had told you. You would jump to your feet. Yes, my name is Tony. Even my heart missed a beat seeing her. Very good, now start your job. I want the designs ready by day after tomorrow. -Okay? -Okay. The thief never leaves his antics. It was my helplessness. I had to pass through the back door... ...when the front door was closed. Even you have the practice of this. Why are you doing this? Your manager told me that you need me desperately. Not me, but the company needs you. One and the same thing. But I was dying to work with you. My company is not for your entertainment. Don't be so rude, Ms Sandhya! There's a limit to everything. I asked for partnership. You refused. I asked for friendship. You refused. Now I want to earn a decent living. And you don't even like that. Then what can I do about it? Nothing. Ms. Sandhya, save me from this scorching world. Make me yours. What? The rest is my job. I will give you everything. What? I didn't say this. Your manager said this. He said I am fit for this job. What does he lose in this? I have to work with you. Then work with me. Modeling is not that easy as you think? What's there in modeling? Strange clothes and clumsy girls. Sometimes hand in hand and sometimes on the waist. Sometimes whispering and then roaming in the garden. Then I will always be with you. All right. You will realise this soon. -Here. -What for? Ms. Sandhya has told this. -Ms. Sandhya has told this too? -Yes. Switch on the reflector from both sides. Please, don't. How will the photo come without light? There is sunlight, still you need a reflector? Yes. Ms. Sandhya, ready. Please smile. What? Yes, give a smile. I had told you to smile... ...and not to show your teeth. No one can smile in this hot season. Why? You said that I was easy. Hand in hand. Whispering in the ear. Hand in the waist. Roaming in the garden. What's so hard in modeling? Now, give a smile. I can smile. But there's a condition. Please come near me. I swear by your youth, I will smile my whole life. No, I am better off here. Yes. -Thank you. -Thank you. "You can stay far. You can come closer." "But listen to me for once." "We both will be together one day." "You can stay far. You can come closer." "But listen to me for once." "You belong there. I belong here." "I will never be yours." "You can stay far. You can come closer." "Gentleman, you are roaming behind me." "But your gait is crooked." "Go and learn romance for a couple of years." "You should be able to love." "Then I will..." "Then I will talk." "You can stay far. You can come closer." "But listen to me for once." "You belong there. I belong here." "I will never be yours." "You can stay far. You can come closer." "But listen to me for once." "We both will be together one day." "You can stay far. You can come closer." "O lovely breeze." "Don't make me anxious." "You have to fall in my hands, o my dear..." "You will come one day with your love." "Then I will..." "Then I will ask about it." "You can stay far. You can come closer." "But listen to me for once." "You belong there. I belong here." "I will never be yours." "You can stay far. You can come closer." "But listen to me for once." "We both will be together one day." -"You can stay far." -"You can come closer." -"You can stay far." -"You can come closer." -"You can stay far." -"You can come closer." You haven't eaten anything. What happened? Ramcharan, Tribhuvandas is donating... ...the golden statue of Lord Vishnu to a museum. -When? -Next week. So you go there today itself and start your work. I'll take leave from my office within a couple of days and reach there. The designs have to sent for block making... ...and you are still stuck with lettering. It's better if you click photos of Tony. Instead of staring at me. I have to finish all the work by today evening. But, what's the hurry? I am on a leave from tomorrow? Something special? No, I just need some rest. Go and finish the lettering. If you work hard day and night, then you are bound to be weary. Well are you going for rest? Yes, of course. -For how many days? -10 days. -Where are you going? -I haven't decided yet. Go to a place where no one will recognise you. -What do you mean? -I mean you will get rest. If you need someone for your company, then I am ready. No, thank you very much. I would be better off without you. Take the photograph. Open this. We have kept here a secret camera. It will take the photograph of every person... ...that passes through here. In the same way, we have kept cameras everywhere. And this is the main switch. -Uncle, is it over? -Yes, it's done. Switch it on. Every operation of this function will be done by this switch. Let's go. -Is it ready? -Yes. Now press this button. Saheba! Hold that statue. If anyone touches this statue... ...then this alarm will go off. And our men will be in civil dress all around. Very good! You have made a wonderful arrangement. I am sure if the thief comes here... -...then he will certainly be caught. -Let's go. Hey, you have done a good job. Give me a smoke. Samson, the police have arranged everything. But we must be on our toes. Don't worry. I will place my men on all sides. They will take care of everything. But don't appear before the police. The Bombay police knows you. -Where was this statue made, Mr. Singh? -In Pali islands. Even I thought the same. I saw a similar statue of Lord Vishnu... ...made in the same manner in Bangkok. Inspector, will the thief be caught? The thief will certainly be caught, if he or she comes here. Be fast. Mr. Tribhuvandas, you are great! You gifted such a costly statue to the museum. You could have earned millions if sold outside. What happened? I don't know, the alarm has gone off. Look. Snake! Move aside! Don't shoot it. It's the Snake God! -Catch it. -You catch it. I shouldn't catch it. Hey! Switch it off. -Yes, switch it off. -I will switch it off. -Go inside. -What happened, uncle? There's a big snake there. -Snake? -Yes. Snake God! Run from here! I caught it. Sir, I caught it. -Take it outside. -Take it outside. -Not here, there. -Okay, there. Mr. Tribhuvandas, let's start the function. Snake God, please go from here. The statue that I am donating to you... ...will be a very rare gift for your museum. Please, press the button so that I complete this function. Officers! Constables, take your position all around the bungalow. No one should go out. And search everyone. -Who are you? -I am the servant of this house? Who is there inside? Untie him? Uncle, since how long have you been tied? Sir, that scum tied me here before the program started. Then who was that? How did you come here? I will be there where you are present. Search this room and you go there. Sir, there is no one here. All right. Let's go upstairs. -I am the bearer in the hotel. Which one? -Seagull. -He ruined everything. -Yes, he ruined everything. I am not. -Not him, but you. -Is he a constable or a comedian? Thank you, sir. Sir calls me a fool and you called me a comedian. -Thank you. -Shut up! Send him to a police station immediately. -Where he will be placed... -Yes, sir. -Where? -Get out! Here. Thank you. What are you doing? Thief! Thief! Catch them. My taxi has gone. Is there anyone? My taxi has gone. Two people stole my taxi and ran away. -Can you tell me their face cut? -Yes. There was a long guy wearing a turban. And there was a young guy wearing a cap. -Where was your taxi? -Meera Road. -Meera road? -Yes. -What is the number of your taxi? -GDT 590. Hello! Headquarters calling. Hello! Headquarters, sir! Yes. -Two people have run away with a taxi. -Number. -GDT... -590. They should not get away from the check post. -Listen. Close the gate. -Alright sir. -Two boys have run with a taxi. Get me? -Yes. No one should go from here. -Search everyone. -Okay. They will not escape now. -What happened? -We've run out of petrol. We will not find it here. Let's do one thing. Let's push this car to that side and run away. This is the same taxi. Until we cross the check post, we are not safe. But Goa's border must be nearby. We will escape by the time police reaches there. Thief! Catch him! Thief! Catch him! Thief! Catch him! Thief. Thief! Motorcycle gone. Who stole it? Two persons. Two persons? I mean one girl and one boy. -Sir, we found the taxi. -What about the thieves? They got away on a stolen motorcycle. Motorcycle. Whose motorcycle? It belonged to a foreigner on the beach. They say it was a guy and a girl. But the taxi driver was saying that there were two guys. Anyway, inform the check post immediately. Be in line. Hello! Maulang! Maulang! Hello! Tell him to stop making that noise. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Let them go. Go! Hello! Oh! Hello, sir! A guy and a girl have stolen a motorcycle and ran away. On a motorcycle? Motorcycle! Motorcycle! Catch them. -But they have run away. -They have run away? Now we are gone. First sir told that two guys are in a taxi. Then he said that one guy and a girl are on a motorcycle. Whom should we catch? It seems that they have run away. Is there a check post nearby? Yes. One more. Hello, Anmol checkpost, I am speaking from the headquarters. Did a motorcycle come here? -A motorcycle had come. -Yes. -It was red in color. -Yes. -There was a guy and a girl on it. -Yes. It went away. -Where did the motorcycle go? -There. Hold me. Hold me tightly. Sir, a message has come from the wireless that they have left... ...the motorcycle and ran away. And they can cross the border at any time. Saurabh, these are the prints of the statue. -Send them to all the stations immediately. -Okay, sir. "I am in love with my lover." "I am in love with my lover." "Is love lesser than this false world." "I am in love with my lover." "I am in love with my lover." "Is love lesser than this false world." "I am in love with my lover." "I am in love with my lover." "Wet with consciousness beneath this wide sky." "May I not get burned falling in my lover's arms?" "When we fall to the ground out of tiredness." "We get peace inhaling this poison." "We live by love and die by love." "I am in love with my lover." "Our faith is to laugh and have fun." "We don't know how to hide under any lie." "Our duty is to shake our minds out." "My arms are swinging in fun and my anklets are in rhythm." "The music of love is booming everywhere." "I am in love with my lover." "I am in love with my lover." "Is love lesser than this false world." "I am in love with my lover." Listen, I am not coming without the statue. Forget the statue. The police are behind us. How did you get this statue? Hail Lord Krishna. Where did you get this statue from? Hail Lord Rama. He seems to be insane. Take him to the police station. But this is fake. Then where's the real one? God Vishnu knows that. Sir, these photo were taken from the camera placed at Mr. Tribhuvan's house. Let me see. -Hey! -What happened? He's Tony. -Who is he? -He's the notorious thief from Mumbai. I am a fool that I kept trusted the police. It seems like someone who knows us very well has done it. I doubt Trikamdas. He must have done this. Then let's go and tell the police that Trikamdas must have done this. And if he makes any trouble then we will tell the police that... ...he had a hand in killing Vikram Singh. Bhagwandas, your brains are numb. Better shut your mouth or else I will have a heart attack! If we give him over to the police then... ...he will show us the way to jail. Our documents are in his hands. This matter is not getting solved. We will have to stop this. If the police makes investigation in to this, then we all will get caught. Let's go. I am coming with you to Mumbai. Sandhya, we will be safe if we cross this river. I won't go without the statue. We saved our skin. That's it. Forget about the statue. I can forget everything but not that statue. That statue is my mother's life. And I lost that statue because of you. But that statue was a fake one. Fake? How do you know that? Because the real one is with me. Really? -Where did you get it? -From Tribhuvandas's safe. O Tony! Happy? Let's go. Just wait. I will look at the water. If you are feeling cold, then remove the wet clothes. Come near me and sit by the fire. You will feel warm. But what will I wear? Wear this towel. But this is very small. What if it's small? There is no one to see you here. You are there. You are shy of me? Look, I will close my eyes. Wow! -You are looking? -I am not looking. I know you very well. Get out from here. Outside? In this cold? No way. No need to give such excuses. Move out. If I go out then I will die of pneumonia. -You are very cruel. -Go out from here, go. "Your black eyelids are opening a little." "A thief is going to steal from another thief." "O lover, my black eyelids are opening a little." "A thief is going to steal from another thief." "My black eyelids." "You will come with your anklets on, with your lips shut." "O cruel one, your chic style is so elegant." "You will work your hands on me like a dagger." "Then you will steal my heart thinking I am a fool." "Every night, you will pull me with your love strings." -"Your black eyelids..." -"Are opening a little." "A thief is going to steal from another thief." "My black eyelids." "Nor will I tie you..." "Nor will I trap you neither will I send an arrow." "Never will I keep a dagger by my waist." "I will just take away your heart by hiding it from you." "I will smile and call you a fool." "This theft will take place every night in your house." "-My black eyelids... --Are opening a little." "A thief is going to steal from another thief." "Your black eyelids." "In this theft I lost something, but I got something." "Like this you came close to me, I feel like giving up everything." "Our pair is a good one." "We lost everything, yet we gained everything." "We both hugged each other when love happened." "Every night, the moon and partridge will meet each other." "Your black eyelids are opening a little." "A thief is going to steal from another thief." -You have changed in 15 days. -Is it so? And Tony is also missing since 15 days. You went alone, right? I went alone. But this locket is saying something else. My mother's photo is in this locket. Tomorrow, there will be someone else's photo in it. Show it to us. You broke it. Hello, Sandhya. -Good morning sir. -Good morning. -How were the holidays? -The holidays were fantastic. What's this? My locket's broken. This is my mother's photo. Good. A lot of work is pending. You start off immediately. Okay? What can I do for you? Does this gentleman work over here? Yes, he's a model here. Is he available now? No, he is on holiday for two weeks. Can you tell us where he is now? The girl resembles Sandhya. Do you know this girl? She's our art director. She had also gone on a holiday. -She had come just today. -Is she available here? Yes, she is in the opposite cabin. She must have gone in the art department. -I will call her right away. -Where is your art department? Is something serious? It's something of that sort. Then come with me. I will take you there. Listen! -Where is Miss Sandhya? -She went in to the studio just now. -Miss. Sandhya is not here too? -No. Search the whole office? -Yes, sir. -What? Can I see Miss. Sandhya's cabin? -Did Miss. Sandhya come here? -No. Sir, she's not in the office. Send the constables down. And surround the building from all the sides. Whose locket is this? This locket belongs to Sandhya. The same sign of swastika. Are you absolutely sure? Yes, Sandhya said this. She said that the photo inside it belongs to her mother. Photo? Can you give me Sandhya's address? Yes. Search the whole house. Daughter, we are ruined! Your photo has been published. Your clear picture. And they have announced a reward... ...if someone gives them information. That means the police wants to know more about you. But first we should know how much does the police know? But for that we'll have to send our close one to the police station. Where will we find someone like that? -Uncle Ramcharan, tell the police that you were Sandhya's... -Yes. -...servant in Kanpur. -Yes. -If he asks anything after that, just blabber something. -Yes. Sir, he is Ramcharan. He has come seeing Sandhya's photo in the paper. -Greetings! -Greetings! -What do you want? -I want to meet my child. Please give me her address. Child? Are you her father? No, she's my sir Vikram Singh's daughter. I brought her up and took care of her. In Mumbai? In Mumbai and in Kanpur. It has been many days she has left us and come to Mumbai. Please have pity on me. I want to meet my child. What proof do you have that you are Sandhya's servant? I think that you are lying. No, sir. I am not lying. I swear by mother Ganges that if I lie, then my tongue will... ...be slit. I will go to hell. Do you recognise this photo? This is our madam's photo. She's the mother of my child. Ramcharan, you sit outside. We will make arrangements for you to meet your child. Very nice of you, sir. -Mr. Patil, take him to Charandas. -Yes, sir. Manager sir, greetings! Hail Mother Ganges! Don't you remember me? You face seems familiar but... Nowadays I don't remember any face. Old age. You always used to come to my sir Vikram Singh's house. I was his cook then. Oh, Ramcharan. -You are Ramcharan, right? -Yes. It's a very old fact. But inspector, why have you brought Ramcharan here? He had come to the police station from Kanpur. He took your name. So I brought him here. Ramcharan, where were you all these years? We were in Kanpur with ma'am and her daughter. Where are they now? It has been 1 year since ma'am and daughter have come to Mumbai. But I don't have their address now. He has come here seeing the photo published in the newspaper. He says that she's the daughter of Vikram Singh. The wife of Vikram Singh was a pious woman. -How can her daughter be a thief? -That's what I was saying. Inspector, search for that girl. Everything will become clear. Let's go fast. Ramcharan, where will you go? It's his job, let him do it. You have come from the village. You stay with us. Let's go darling, Biryani . Let's have some lemonade. Why have you brought me here? I will show you something which will make you feel refreshed. What's that thing? The thing which I can't show before everyone. Where is that? Where is that? Where is that? I got it. Come. -See this. -These papers? These papers. These papers are not like ordinary newspaper. This is a machine for minting money. This is a goose which lays golden eggs. Seeing this Tribhuvandas and his friends get frightened and... ...then settle all my debts. -Give it to me. -No. It has a problem. This goose lays golden eggs only in my house. The eggs will get spoilt if it's laid in other's house. -Is it so? -Yes, let's go. Let's go from here. TRIBHUVAN SINGH: Ramcharan, you might be missing your sir. RAMCHARAN: Yes, he comes in my dreams very night. What does he say? He says that he's very sad. He wants to come to Earth again. Oh God! Ramcharan, tell me one thing after thinking carefully? Did your ma'am say something about any will? Will? What was that? It's a stamp paper. A kind of paper that your sir must have given to your ma'am. I don't remember very clearly. Yes. But sometimes she used to murmur that... ...if we had that paper, then we wouldn't have been in such condition. Did Trikamdas ever come there? Yes, he used to come. I am doomed. I mean when did he come? He used to come every day. Every day? In Kanpur. Sir, not in Kanpur, but in Mumbai. When our sir was alive, he used to come there every day. Forget it! Don't talk to this fool! Ramcharan, you must be tired now. Go and take some rest. -Okay, sir. My back is paining. He's a fool. He doesn't know anything. -But two things are clear. -What's that? One he knows that we have looted them. And the girl became young and she committed the robberies for... ...the will. And not for money. But the will is with Trikamdas. Why didn't she steal from there? Because she doesn't know that the will is with Trikamdas. What should we do now? We must get the will from Trikamdas. Anyway, Samson is behind him. It seems Trikamdas is not at home. What if he's not at home? Where will he go? Keep your men all around. Keep an eye on this house. -Yes. -Catch him as soon as he comes. I was also thinking that why didn't an intelligent... ...and visionary man like your father didn't leave any will? But now by hearing your words, I think that he made a will in your name. And they hid it and they made your mother, the legal guardian... ...and deceived her in to making all the property theirs. But why didn't father tell mother about this will? Because he was murdered before he could tell it. -Murder? -Yes. The way in which your father was killed was not an accident... ...but a murder. But what can be done now? The police is searching for me and I have been accused of theft. Sandhya, it's your good luck that Trikamdas... ...used the will to blackmail them and it's safe. SANDHYA'S LAWYER: If you get the will then you will be remitted of the theft... ...and they all will get the death sentence. But how will this be proved? That's my job. But how will we get the will? Just like we got other things, in the same way we will get the will. Mr. Advocate, don't worry. It's my job to get the will. And your job to free Sandhya. It seems that Trikamdas has come home. Let's go. The light is on. It seems that Trikamdas has come. Call up the inspector. -Did you get it? -It's not here. Close it. This is Tony. You move from here. I will deal with them. Be fast. Police! Run! Run! Don't move or I will shoot! Catch them! Thief! Catch them! I have brought all the refuse. This is not worth anything to us. And in the hurry, you got Sandhya caught. -How can I? -Not you, then who? If you hadn't asked her to steal the papers, then she wouldn't have been caught. I have not committed any theft. The jewellery that I have taken are all mine. Is it a crime to take what's yours? What's this uncivilized behavior? Your wealth and prestige are in my hands. Don't forget that. You scum, you are forgetting it. You are not supposed to behave this way with a decent man. Your life is in my hands before our wealth and prestige are... ...in your hands. You can't go alive from this house... ...if you don't give the will to us. I will smash your bones. -Uncle, the work has been done? -What? This is the new receipt of the house of Trikamdas. And the address is also given in it. Get it down. -Is this Mr. Trikamdas's house? -Yes. He has given an order for a new cupboard. Cupboard? But we didn't give any order. You must not have given, but sir must have given. You must take the delivery. How can I take the delivery? I will have to ask sir. If I meet sir on the way and he asks me, why didn't I give... ...the delivery. Then what will I say. I will have to come again. -My whole day will be wasted. -Then what can I do? I will keep the cupboard wherever you say. I will take it away if sir says no. Bring it in. Be careful. Be careful. Kept it carefully. This is the receipt of the delivery and the key. But the key is not opening it. Why? Have you come to your senses now? You fool, if you don't answer... ...then your new bride will become a widow. At least think about her. I am tolerating this thrashing for her. If I give you the will, then she will run away. Will the people who killed Vikram Singh leave you? I will give it to you. I will bring it right away. We will come with you. If you make any noise on the way... ...then this silencer will not let anyone know. Hey now... We must call the police. Right away, mate. Biryani! Biryani! -It's seems that there is someone inside. Surround from all sides. -Okay boss. Catch him! Catch him! Biryani, what happened? That man ran away with your papers. -Papers? -We are doomed. Come with us. Thief! Catch him! Thief! Tony. Catch him! Catch him! Thief! Catch him! Tony, come here. Tony, be fast. Come here. Tribhuvandas has brought me here forcibly. They have hit me a lot. Please save me from them or else they will kill me. Don't fear. Come with me. -You also come. -I didn't do anything. I don't know anything. -Sign here. -Yes. Commissioner, I have accepted my crime. I hope the magistrate will have some pity on me. I can't say anything about pity. But he will certainly not do injustice. -Mr. Patil, take him away. -Yes, sir. And send the others in. Come. TRIBHUVAN SINGH: Commissioner, what's this? Why have we been kept waiting? Because your friend has stated his crime. Have a seat. See here. It's written that he killed Vikram Singh for you... ...and later you made it in to an accident. And it had been done to get hold of Vikram Singh's wealth. And these three were involved with you in this conspiracy. No commissioner, I was not involved in this conspiracy. I had signed on the will. They had given me some money to keep my mouth shut. I am ready to give it back. Please let go of me. Trikamdas is a liar and a blackmailer. How can we be criminals if he says so? You are absolutely right. This will shall prove all your crimes? Are these signatures yours? Yes, these are our signatures. Commissioner, I hope now you have the proof to take them in custody... -...for killing Mr. Vikram Singh? -No doubt. So please take them in custody. -And release Sandhya on bail. -Yes. Understood. This blood? Don't worry about this blood and listen to this good news. What? We got the will and they've been arrested. -Really? O Tony! -Yes. -Go inside. I will take out your tongue. -Let's go. Goodbye, Sandhya. I have come to meet you for the last time. Last time. The six months in jail will go away like 6 days and 6 moments. And then you will come back to me. No, Sandhya. You are now from a high class decent family. And I am a drifter. How can we be together? We can be if you don't deceive me. -Deceit! -No. Two decent people can deceive each other... ...but two thieves can't deceive each other. SANDHYA: I am a culprit before the law. I know that I will be jailed too. But along with the sorrow of the jail, I will be happy... ...that I have made mother happy. And after coming out of jail, you will be there for me. Sandhya, think about it once again. -I have thought about it. -What? "I am in love..." "I am in love..." "I am in love with my lover." "I am in love with my lover." "Is love lesser than this false world?" "I am in love with my lover."
