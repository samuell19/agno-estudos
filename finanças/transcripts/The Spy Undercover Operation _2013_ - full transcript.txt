It would seem so Please follow me It was North Korea Their typical tactics First make a friendly gesture then strike! Making it a popular dating spot Who the hell was it? North Koreans or the Americans? We're still trying to confirm We've detected suspicious movements on Baek Seol-hui's side In Beijing, they're planning an independent operation What about South Korea? They don't seem to know what to do Can't do a thing on their own, can they? Baek Seol-hui? She is the daughter of the deceased North Korean minister She requested asylum in South Korea We assume she knows something about the airplane bombing Where is she now? In Thailand, attending an energy conference Why aren't we bringing her over? She is under a heavy surveillance by the North Koreans Shouldn't we reschedule the six-party talks? No We must stick to the original plan But we have so little time Launch Sejong Trading Last night, an Air Force training jet crashed near Seongnam due to a suspected mechanical problem It is reported that the crashed aircraft attempted to make an emergency landing but subsequently failed and crashed into a mountain Great job Wasting tax-payers' money on a fight in a foreign country Sorry, sir We have a new package Bring in Kim Sir...

A coded text from the CIA was received in Thailand an hour ago I believe there was an operation What are you talking about? Cuckoo Cuckoo... The rice cooker? No It's a code name for Baek Seol-hui How is the CIA involved in this? It could be at the request of North Korea or it could be an independent operation In any case, they couldn't have gotten her out yet Where are they keeping her? If she is still in Thailand, she has got be here CIA South-East Asia Regional headquarters in Satenthai Shall we go in? No, wait We're to wait for approval from the Tile-roofed House We believe operatives from different agencies are after Baek for their own reasons Satenthai ls there a face that you recognize? It seems as if the North Korea hard-liners were responsible for the airplane terror attack that occurred in South Korea It's going to be dangerous if you enter North Korea now But, we can protect you Has this been approved by the North Korean authorities? The fact that you tried to get asylum from South Korea has spread almost everywhere It's probably best for you to rely on us now. That's most likely the wisest method It's the Americans who have Baek Then why aren't we doing anything about it? It's between the two Koreas What are you talking about? If we start getting involved It could tangle things up terribly Please follow me This is Chirashi Chirashi? Yes High-value information leaked from the Korean stock exchange Foreign investors are pulling out The airplane bombing and kidnapping of Baek... North Korean hardliners were behind them In order to consolidate their holds they'll try to launch an attack on the South This means war You took your time to call I've been busy Where are you?
