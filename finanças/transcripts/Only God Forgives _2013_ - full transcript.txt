ONLY GOD FORGIVE My brother's right. You're a good fighter. Don't spend it all in one place. Time to meet the devil. Are those women? Yeah, 50 percent. I'm looking for a girl. A young girl. I want to fuck a 14-year-old. Only what you see. Let me ask you a question. You got a daughter? Bring her in. I'll pay you 15,000 baht. No, no, no. Sorry. Hello. Hey, not do like that. Come on. Oh... Good evening, sir. Right over here. He Your daughter? How could you do that? Why did you let this happen? I did not do anything. You have chance to do something now. Whatever you want. Come, come with me. I'm sorry. I 'm really sorry. Please do not kill me. Why did you regret? You were there at that time. You know what I'm doing. He killed my daughter. Why did you kill that man? Why did you kill that man? Because he killed my daughter! You know what your daughter is doing. Why did not you stop her? How else can I make a living? I've 4 daughters and no sons. What I should do? Do not you understand? My daughter has just been killed! It's not about your daughter who is dead. But your three daughter is still alive. This is so you do not forget them. Please. I will be better. Please, do not kill me! Not! It's about your brother. Billy's dead. Hello, good morning. I'm checking in. One moment, please. I'm afraid the room wouldn't be ready until four o'clock. It's a policy. Get your manager. Sir, could you please come to Front section briefly? He'll be here in a minute. What's your problem? There were guests who wish to speak with you. Good morning, madam. How may I help you? Listen to me. I have just traveled 10,000 miles to see the corpse of my first-born son. I haven't slept in 30 hours. And this bitch says I can't have my room. How are you? Please keep an eye on the situation around, kid. Mom! Ask him why he killed my brother. Who 's paying for killing his brother? Hello. - Sorry, I'm late. - It's okay. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - What 's for dinner? - Chicken and rice soup. We should not bother him now. So what if he acting up again? Could we discuss. Did you miss me? I missed you so much. Did you get the guy that did it? How did you kill him? I let him go. Get the door. Are you out of your fucking mind? Some cunt killed your brother and you let him go? It's a little more complicated than that, Mother. Meaning what, exactly? Billy raped and killed a 16-year-old girl. I'm sure he had his reasons. Now sit! I know it's hard for you emotionally. You've lost your brother. Don't worry. I'll take care of the yellow nigger who killed my son. It's too much for you. Now get up and kiss your mother. If you ever come back, I'll kill you. - Is it done? - Yeah. How's business? Yeah, it's OK. I could do with having Billy back, though. Isn't Julian taking care of everything? He hasn't told you, has he? There was someone else involved... when Billy was killed. - Who? - Some cop. Don't worry. I'll find him. And then we'll kill him. Good. Who's that? Maybe he likes whiskey. You want whiskey? She doesn't know what to think. He says he didn't see it, Mum. A foreigner called up Liang and spoke English. Then he went with him and took the phone with him. Hey, Julian. The cops want to see you. - What do they want? - Probably money. - You want me to ask how much? - No, I'll go. You're Julian? - Do you know Choi Yan Lee? - Who? Your brother killed his daughter. What's that have to do with me? Choi Yan Lee was murdered. - When? - Yesterday. You can't go around killing cops anymore. How much do you want? It's not about the money. What's in it for me? I have five kilos of blow arriving Friday. I need someone to help me move it. You got any questions, you ask him. And what about Julian? Don't worry about Julian. - Are you in or out? - I'm in. I'd like you to meet my mother. I want us to pretend that we're a couple. Can you do that? Will you wear this? So, tell me, Mai. What line of work are you in? - I'm an entertainer - An entertainer? And how many cocks can you entertain with that cute little cum-Dumpster of yours? What do you think of his line of work? I'm not talking about the fag boxing club. I'm talking about where the money comes from. You know what he does, right? He deals drugs, Mai. Heroin, cocaine. That's where the money comes from. That's how he can afford to pay you to fuck him. Oh, great. I'll get the crab. He'll have the spicy chicken. And May here will have a salad with the dressing on the side. It's Mai. I'm sorry. I apologize for my behavior. It's just that, I'm a little upset. I have lost my first son. I'm sorry for that. Thank you. It's good to know someone cares. 'Cause I swear to God, sometimes I think Julian hated Billy. Maybe "hate" is the wrong word. But you were always jealous of him. You know the way boys are, May. Competitive. And what with Billy being the older brother and having a bigger cock... Julian's was never small, but Billy's was... Oh, it was enormous. How can you compete with that? Billy was everything Julian wanted to be. Is that not true? 'Cause let me tell you, if the tables were turned, your brother would have found your killer and brought me his head on a fucking platter! And you just sit there thinking he got what he deserved! Fuck you. I don't want to talk about it anymore. Do you mind if I smoke? You can keep that dress if you want to. I don't want it. Why do you let her treat you like that? 'Cause she's my mother. Now if you don't want that dress, take it off. Take it off! You know why I'm here? Yes. Was he planned it! Just ask him. Shut up! Nobody asked. - Yes, sir. - What's your excuse? I'm not afraid of the consequences. I'm just asking... so as not to hurt my son. - I told you, right? - Shut up! Who the fuck are you? Get out of my club. Remember, ladies, whatever happens, ... Close your eyes. And you men, ... look good. Can somebody tell me what the fuck this cunt is trying to say? Who put out the hit? Go fuck yourself. How about that? Why? She said you murdered her son. She wanted you dead. Who is that woman? Fuck you. You can not see what's good for you. Better you can not see. You've got a chance. But you're stubborn. Do not want to listen. If you do not want to hear, ... then stop listening. You know who he is? Want to fight? When I was pregnant with you... it was strange. You were different. They wanted me to terminate... but I wouldn't. And you're right. I don't understand you. And I never will. What have you done? I fucked up. I tried to do right by Billy. And now I'm going to pay. He's coming after me next, and I have no one left to protect me. I know after your father I said I'd never ask you again, but please, Julian, just this once. Take care of this for me. Don't let them hurt me. Then we can get out of here. We can go home. I can take care of you. I can be your mother again. Who's going to do the kid? We're just here for him. But that's not what she said. What did she say? She said to kill them all. I came here to collect my son's body. Now that it's been released, my business here in Bangkok is done. I'm ready to go home. - When are you leaving? - I was leaving tonight. And your other son? Is he going with you? What, Julian? Oh... I haven't had any real contact with Julian since he left America. But you were there last night. Yeah. He's not much of a fighter. And it breaks my heart that Billy got caught up in the scene here because of him. Billy was my first son. We had a very special relationship. Julian was so jealous. It was like he was cracked or something. He had paranoid delusions about us. And it pains me to say this to you, as it would pain any mother, but he killed his own father with his bare hands. That's why he had to get out of America. He's a very dangerous boy.
