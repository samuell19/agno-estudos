Hey, you ever think about getting a Vanna White for trivia night? - Do I look like Pat Sajak? It's only one night a week. - But everyone loves trivia night. - You love trivia night. - Well, think about it this way. If you get yourself an MC, then everyone clearly knows that you're the host. - I'm the only one in this bar with a microphone and a laptop. Pretty sure people know I'm the host. We gonna see the nerd herd tonight? - No, Wilson changed our D&D game to tonight because of Thanksgiving. - Well, it'll be good for somebody else to win, finally. - Yeah, Mary Jo's been gloating all week. - I'll bet she has. Good luck tonight at D&D, and I will see you at Thanksgiving. - Thank about that Vanna White for trivia night. - Okay. (melancholy music) - Cut those a little smaller. - Smaller? - Jack doesn't like the texture when they're too big. - I got it. Is Jack seeing anybody? - You know, I think he's allergic to them. Every time I mention a girl, his face squinches up. - Aw, he's a late bloomer. What about Becca? - Her last girlfriend was an actress, and she couldn't handle it when Becca got the lead, so they broke up. - That's too bad. - I don't know, I didn't like her very much. When we went up to visit, she hardly showed up. - Well, our families are loud and loving. Maybe she didn't know what to do with that. - Maybe, but Becca's coming home for Christmas the full month. She hasn't been back in three years. - I cannot wait to see her. You know, we never did get up to see her show. - She loves New York. She loves life on that stage. You know, she just threw herself into her work. - That is so lovely. - Her last show is Thanksgiving. - I can't believe that Broadway doesn't close on Thanksgiving. - Is Sam seeing anybody? - Not really, kind of on again off again with Judy. - Pharma sales rep Judy? - I don't think it's anything serious, I just kind of think it's more of a convenience. - Like a booty call? - Tilly! - She and Sam were so happy together. - Nothing like high school love. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - On the count of three, let's say it together. - [Both] One, two, three, they were so good together! - No no no, wait, nobody likes meddling moms. - Are you kidding? Everyone likes meddling moms. - Ah, then we only have one month to convince them that they are perfect for each other. - Then let's get to meddling. - Yes! - All right, so here is how we're going to do it. - All right, folks, let's give it up for Mary and the Joes! - Yeah! - Yeah! - This week's winners. All right, y'all. Thank you for coming out for trivia night. I will see you next week, and I hope all you folks have a happy and safe Thanksgiving. Goodnight, y'all. (cheerful music) - Another good trivia night. - Yeah, Mary Jo's team was thrilled that Jack's wasn't here this week. - Oh my god, they are so cute. Should we give them some help? High school sweethearts. - High school sweethearts are very overrated. - Um, excuse me, love kill, I remember you having a very lovely high school romance. - Well yeah, I mean, until you go off to college and, you know, two roads diverge in a wood. - Your moms are best friends, and Jack is her brother. You will always be in her life in some way. - Well yeah, I mean, as friends. I'm happy for her. You know, she's doing what she's meant to. - And what I'm supposed to do is play Cupid up in this mother. I'm gonna hook them up. Figure it out. - Mm-hm. - [Announcer] Strong in the catch, haul that one in, and right now, Joe, playing that Patriot team. This is the first time they've trailed in a game since week one. - Thanks, mom. - Wide open inside the 40. - What? Come on. - Oh, don't even. It's a wrap. You all were barely even watching. It is time for some music. (cheerful music) ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ - Man, Thanksgiving isn't even over. We're already playing Christmas music. - Why are you surprised? Christmas decorations have been on sale since Halloween. - Yeah. - It's a universal truth. Thanksgiving is the official start of the holiday season. - Yeah, but I just like every holiday to get its due, you know? Our families spend Thanksgiving together every year, you know, and that's just really special to me. - Well, I know Lucille and I are so looking forward to Christmas, because we finally have all family home. - We do? - Becca's coming home for Christmas. We will have our children home. Isn't it wonderful? - When? She's just coming for the day, right? - She's here this weekend. - Is she staying through Christmas? - A whole month with our Becca. How lucky are we? - So lucky. - So lucky. - Aren't you so excited, too, Sam? - Yeah, yeah, I'm so excited. I just, it's just such a shame, 'cause I am going to be so busy with the Christmas show, you know? Ms. Wilkinson is going to have me building sets, designing the set, you know, and painting the set. - Time to retire the old tape measure. - Exactly. - I can't wait for you two to see one another again. I know how special you are to Becca. - And we, we know how much Becca means to you. - Absolutely, yeah, I just, I love being home, and I just know Becca probably loves being home too, and I really cannot wait to introduce her to Judy, so. - Judy, yes, Judy. Are you all still together? - Yeah, yeah, we're, like, better than ever. - Yeah, better than ever. I see Judy all the time. (doorbell rings) - Oh, that must be Ava and Sandy. - They'll be excited about the news, too. (audience cheering) (cheering continues) - So today is the last show for our Monica, Becca Winters. (audience cheering) Becca, we are going to miss you so much, but we were wondering if you would be willing to sing one more song for us. - Of course. - Thank you. - I'd like to thank this amazing cast and everyone who came out to support us. I'd like to usher in this holiday season with a song from my upcoming Christmas album, "Merry and Gay". (cheerful music) ♪ We've hung all the lights, we've placed the star ♪ ♪ Stockings hanging by the fire ♪ ♪ Every time you catch my eye, I can hardly believe ♪ ♪ Santa must've heard my wish ♪ ♪ 'Cause now you're here with me ♪ ♪ Merry and gay, merry and gay ♪ ♪ You make every day ♪ ♪ Shiny and bright, I'm not gonna lie ♪ ♪ I think love's here to stay, merry and gay ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ - Ugh, I'm so sad to see you packing up all your things. - I know, I'm going to miss everyone. - Why didn't you renew your contract? And also, I just heard about Adriana. I am so sorry. - Yeah, it's hard to date actresses. She was upset when she wasn't cast. - Oh wow, that's rough. - Yeah. Think I need a reset. Haven't had a break in three years, and I really miss home. - Well, going home will be good, but we're going to miss you so much, and you'll always be my favorite Monica. - Yeah, you're going to say that to all the Monicas. - Probably. Do you have something else lined up? - I have a few options, but I don't want to sign onto anything too soon, you know? - Mm-hm, okay, when you get back, let's get a drink. - I'd love to. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Okay. (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) (door creaking) (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) (phone beeps) (melancholy music continues) - Mom? Came right over, where you at? Mom? Mom? Oh, I came right over. (romantic music) - Oh good, I'm so happy you're here. - Of course I'm here, your text said you needed me to come over right away. - We were just about to have tea. Come on in, and Becca's here. Why don't you just sit down and I'll fix you a cup of tea? Here you go. - There better be whiskey in this. - Becca was just telling me how exciting it is to be on Broadway. - That's really it, Lucille. It's all very exciting and fun. I'm sure you can imagine. - You're here for a while. - Yes, it's been too long. I'm just really excited to spend the holiday with everyone, my mom, brother, you. - And we're so happy that you're here. Honey, I loved visiting you in the city, but having you come home for Christmas again, that is truly so special. - Yeah, three Christmases later. - I can't believe it's been three years. - Mom, can I talk to you for a minute? - I'll be right back. - You bamboozled me! - Shh! Oh please, and I thought Tilly's child was the dramatic one. - You brought me here under false pretenses, and now I have to sit in that room and have tea with Becca and Tilly Winters! - You both always loved having tea with us. - When we were 12, Mom! I have work to do. I'm leaving. - Oh, you most certainly are not. Honestly, Sam, she hasn't been home for three years, and this is how you behave? Avoiding her? You are going to go back in there, sit your butt back down with our company, and be pleasant. (Sam sighs) (melancholy music continues) - Is everything okay? - Yeah, I just had some work to get done, but it can wait. - Oh. Good. - Well, Becca has some news to share. - Yeah, I stopped by the theater earlier today to see if they needed any help with the show. Wilkie couldn't believe I was there. She actually asked me to direct the show this year. - So my daughter's not only a star, but she's a director now, too. - Oh, that's wonderful. And Sam is about to take over for Bob as stage manager. Isn't that wonderful, Sam? - No. - Sam. - Way. No way. You are a natural choice for the job. - You think so? - I think what would go perfectly with this tea is shortbread. - Oh, I think I have some in the pantry. - Do you have any with pecans? They're my favorite. - Oh, I think I do have some out there in the garage pantry. - I'll help you look. - Why don't you just go on out here and get some stuff? - I think Wilkie was happy to pass the show off this year. - Well, she has done quite a few of them. - She did say it was her 46th show. There's only so many times you can hear the Gladtones singing "Hark the Herald Angels Sing". Anyway, I'm just happy to be involved, and we get to work together. Evergreen always does put on a great Christmas show. - It is where you got your start on the stage. - It was. I'm just really happy to see you. Spend some time with you. You're really important to me. - I can't believe I don't have pecan sandies. I swear, I bought some last week. - Well, Becca, it was great to bump into you. I will try and find some time to see you more while you're here. Maybe at open mic night. - Well, that might be nice. (cheerful music) - I'm getting six! - Mikey, what is all this? - I'm not gonna let this get in the way of me and dreams, Sam. - You broke your wrist juggling bowling balls, and now you're going to destroy your fingers. - Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam. If I get six traps in 15 seconds, woo, that's whole world record, baby! - She's going for juggling world record. I believe in you. - Thank you, Bob. - Remember, practice makes perfect. - Open mic, that's where I'm gonna seal the deal. Ava! - Yeah? - Let them know. - Okay, got you, sis. - Mouse trap juggler with a broken wrist! Mm. Open mic, be there. - Why don't you take this? - You know what, I might need that. You are correct. - Yeah, see you later, Mikey. - You know, most people see Mikey as the town eccentric, but Mikey knows how to dream big. - Sure does. So, pops, I think I'm going to need you to take back over the Christmas show. - You were so excited to take the lead. - Yeah, well, I mean, things are different now. Becca's directing. - Good for Becca. Well. (melancholy music continues) I don't understand. - I mean, we can't, like, have a set piece falling on the Leland twins. - It's a volunteer job, Sam. You can handle it, all right? You've shadowed me since you were this big. - Yeah, but that was for Ms. Wilkinson. This is Becca, you know? She could want something fancy, like a flying set piece or something, that Broadway stuff. I can't do that. - You got this, all right? Just make sure to have one of these on you at all times, and you'll be fine. - Yes, sir. - All right. - No tape measure is going to help you with your real problem. - Oh yeah? What's my real problem? - You can't be around Becca because it's too hard for you. You still love her. - Don't be ridiculous, she's just my childhood best friend. - She's your first love, and she's the love of your life. And you can pretend that you don't care, but she's back, and you do. - Don't be ridiculous, she's my childhood best friend. Stop judging me. (cheerful music) Oh, that's all right, pops, I got it. You can head out. - All right, kiddo. - All right, take care. - Get home safe. - Will do. - Hello. - Hi. - Oh, hey, Judy. - Hey, babe. - [Sam] All right, all right, all right. ♪ You make it look easy ♪ - I think you should go for her. - Go for her? - Sam, you clearly still have feelings for Becca. - No, that was a long time ago. - The way you look when you talk about her, that's not a little high school crush. You're in love. - I am not. - You are. I hope our thing isn't stopping you. - No, it's not. You know, Becca and I are just on different paths. It's just a timing thing. - I'd find a way to get on the same path. - Maybe. Cheers. - To being on the same path. ♪ Someone else's eyes ♪ - Of course, we use the same set for each act. The acts all stay backstage in the wings, except for the Nativity scene, and we roll that out at the end. - Got it. - You're being very nice to pretend to write things down, Becca. - I just want to make sure I get it right. - Well, this is your show now. - Just for this year, but really, I feel like I'm just helping you. - Well, if you can take rehearsals, that's the most important part. The show really runs itself. Bob does make a new set every year. - I thought Sam was in charge this year. - Oh, that's right. How fitting for you and Sam to be working on the show this year. Reminds me of you guys working on the shows in high school. Sam insisted on you being able to fly in "Peter Pan". - That's right, the system Sam got was from the regional tour that came through Nashville. - The determination that one has. Anyway, we close the curtains between acts, which gives us all a chance to regroup and to take a little nip of eggnog. - I knew it. - Sam! Speak of the devil. - Hey. - Wonderful. Come, come. - I'm just dropping off some equipment, you know. Can't really stay, but maybe I could come by later. - Nonsense, this will take half a minute. Now, I'm not going to micromanage you, but as you know, this is a variety show. Doesn't really matter the order of performances, but I strongly suggest that the final scene be the Nativity scene. I know, I know, people are going to say it's old-fashioned, but to me, it's about community and family coming together, and that's what Evergreen is all about. - I couldn't have said it better myself. - Agreed, I will take care of the Nativity first thing and I will let you know the second it's done. - Oh, don't tell me, dear. Everything you do now is for Becca. It's going to be a wonderful show. (melancholy music continues) (drawer thuds) (melancholy music continues) - Look at you two. You were both so happy. - They're avoiding me. Everyone's made time to see me except for Sam. - Do you know why? - I wish they'd tell me. - Honey, Sam invited you to open mic night. You should go. - I don't think that was a real invite, Mom. - [Jack] Hey Mom, I'm going to Sheridan's for open mic night. - Oh, don't tell me Mikey's juggling tonight with a broken wrist. - [Jack] Yes, she moved to mousetraps. - This I got to see. - Welcome to Sheridan's open mic. We are so excited to have you. We have some awesome guests coming up tonight. If we don't get the party started, I'm not gonna talk too much, so coming up first to the mic, let's give it up for Mikey! - My goal is to get up to six mousetraps, which will be a world record, which is going down at the Christmas pageant! But you have to start somewhere, so I'm going for two traps for 10 seconds, y'all! - Woo! Come on, Mikey! - Let's get that music going! - Yeah yeah, you got it. You got this. You got this. (cheerful music) - Woo! (cheerful music continues) - 9, 10. (audience cheering) Yeah! Five, four, three! Aw. (audience groaning) - I'm gonna do four next time! (audience cheering) - Yay, you got it! Okay, we're gonna roll right into your next performer. (melancholy music) - This performer's pronoun is fabulous. Give it up for Brandon doing one of his spoken word pieces. - "The 17-Year-Old and the Gay Bar" by Danez Smith. This gin-heavy heaven, blessed ground to think gay and mean we. (melancholy music continues) - Hi, Sam. - Hi. What can I get you? - Vodka tonic, please. - My usual. - Your usual. - His usual's a Shirley Temple. - Oh my god, hi. - Hey, how are you? - So good to see you. Good. - You too! - I was going to ask, can you sing your new song? - You want to sing with me? - Really. - If you know the song, you sign, I'll sing. - Yes! - Okay. - Yes! - Oh my gosh. You guys are going to kill it. I'm so excited. - Okay, here we go. Let's do it. - We are very, very proud to introduce this next guest, our very own Evergreen celebrity, here to perform her new holiday single "Merry and Gay", give it up for Becca and our very own Sandy!

You were amazing in "I'll Be There for You". - You came to see it? - Of course, I've seen all your shows. - That's really sweet. Brandon, your poems are really lovely. - Aw, thank you. It is so good to have you home. - It's good to be home. You should do a poem for the Christmas pageant. - Really? - Yeah. I'm directing it this year, and I'm cutting one of the Gladtone songs. - Scandalous. Okay, great. I need a shot to celebrate. - It's going to take me five more times, probably. - You know, once upon a time, I actually got three in 15 seconds. But tonight just wasn't my night. - Well, we're all behind you. - You know, I feel y'all's spirit up there with me. Night, Sam. - Goodnight. - Thank you for teaching me too, by the way. - That was so great. - Hey! Thank you. - Thank you so much for doing it. - Yeah, of course. Thanks for having us. - Is the nerd herd going to be playing this Wednesday? - I think so. - Well, we won the last two Wednesdays. So I hope you bring your A game. - We will. You and your Joes better be ready. - You know, I got in early admission to Chapel Hill. - I didn't know that. - Yes. It was my first choice. You're not the only smart one in Evergreen. You just think you are. - But I also got early admission to Chapel Hill. - I know. We're going to eat you for lunch next trivia night. - Oh, really? Is that what you think? - [Mary Jo] Yeah, it is what I think. - [Jack] Ever learn about imaginary numbers? What do you know about equations? What's the Pythagorean Theorum? - [Mary Jo] I know a lot of equations. - Mm-hm. - Oh my god. - I know. It's been too long. You all are so special to me, my heart. Yes. - Bye. - So, what is going on with you and Sam? - I don't know, we haven't talked in three years. - Three years? Not even a phone call? - No. I tried, but they never answered. And when I texted, I got a thumbs up emoji or a can I call you later auto-response message, so I just stopped. Then I got a random text. "I'm dating Judy now, just thought you should know." So, they ghosted me. - I don't know, I think Sam loves you. - Hey y'all, they're finally cashing out and it's past closing, so we should, you know, wrap it up. - Oh fudge. - What? - Jack left me. - I can close up. Sam, take Becca home. - No! - Sam, you take Becca home. - No no, I got it. It's fine. - No! - You afraid of me? - No, I just don't want you to have to, you know, close up. - I'm good. Thank you so much. Yeah, Sam, take Becca home. You guys be safe. I still support you. - Okay, I will take you home. - Thanks. (engine rumbling) Are you all ready for Christmas? - Not much to prepare for these days. Just gift cards or cash. You all set for Christmas? - Mom is dying for an InstaPot and Jack is a bit of a wild card. I'm at a loss. - Just a new headset for his Xbox. He keeps buying cheap ones and they keep breaking. - Thanks. - Yeah, no problem. - Tomorrow, I'm stopping by the high school to talk to Mrs. Miller's class. - Ah, impressionable theater kids. Be sure to tell them to have a plan B. I'm kidding. - Dream crusher. - No, I'm sure you're going to inspire all of them to go chase all their dreams. You've always been really good at helping people believe in themselves. - It's amazing how this place never changes. Even the telephone pole's still standing. - It's a telephone pole, Becca. I mean, where's it going to go? - Cliff would back into it every Sunday on his way to church. You'd think it'd be flat by now. - They actually took his license away a few years ago. - Oh, that's sad. How does he get to church? - I mean, we all pitch in, help get him where he needs to go. There's a signup sheet at the bar. - That's why I love this place. Do you think we could spend some real time together soon? - We are spending time together. - Sam, I want to really catch up with you, clear things up. - Let's just leave the past where it is. - Sam. - Becca. You're here for a month. Let's just try and enjoy this time, okay? I'm asking as a friend, please? - Will I see you at the theater tomorrow? - Maybe. - I hope I do. Thanks for the ride. - You're welcome. (door thuds) (melancholy music) (melancholy music continues) (tense music) - Sam's not here. I see Becca, and she is surrounded by a whole squad of cheerleaders. I wonder if they're planning a group number. They can all really dance. - Lucille, focus. Get a closer look. Sam has to be there. - I see Becca and the performers, and yeah, I guess we just missed Sam. - Where could they be? - How is this ever going to work when they're never in the same room together? - It's only been 10 days, be patient and calm down. - The only time they've seen each other is when we've planned it. I'm beginning to think that we're the only ones that see how in love they really are. - Impossible. - I mean, you saw the tension the other day, the way they looked at each other. I mean, that is love! Aw. We are not giving up. We're just going to have to get more aggressive with our tactics, and we may need reinforcements. It is the only thing I want for Christmas. - I asked for an InstaPot. - Hey, Sam. - Yeah? - Hey, I want to tell you something, and I need you to promise you're not going to make fun of me or tell my mom or Becca. - Okay. - Mary Jo's going to Chapel Hill next year and she makes my palms sweaty. It's not funny. - Well, would it help you at all if you knew she liked you too? - Maybe. - You're both smart. You both volunteer at the animal shelter. - Yeah. - Why don't you just ask her if she wants to volunteer at the same time as you, and she says yes, you know she likes you? - That's a really good idea. Thanks, Sam. - No problem. - So a few more ceiling lights? - Yeah, but should we get some colored lights to glam it up a little bit? - Yes, perfect. - Deal. - Hi. - Am I in your way up here? - No, not at all. I'm happy you're here. - I was thinking maybe the Nativity could go center stage. - Yeah, you're always so great at thinking about sets and how actors move in them. You'll always be the one who made me fly. In "Peter Pan". Sam, do you think that- - How's Adriana? - How did you know about Adriana? - I read Page Six. - She broke up with me after I got Monica in "I'll Be There for You" and she didn't get the lead. - That was, like, six months ago. They didn't report your breakup. - Not everything you read is true. - Becca, Becca! Becca, can we get a selfie? - I got to get back to this. - Hi. Oh. Okay. (camera clicks) - [Radio DJ] Well, the stress of the holidays is wearing on a lot of you out there. If you're stuck in traffic, here's a holiday song to calm your nerves. Here's "True North". (cheerful music) - What's the matter with you? - Looking for my "Pippin" mug. It was my first Broadway show, and it makes me feel happy. Is that okay with you? - Easy, killer. I was just asking. These are clean. - Thank you. Oh fudge, did you finish the creamer? - It's right there above the yogurt. Been all right, sis? You seem beyond irritable. - I'm fine, just need coffee. - If you say so. Taming the beast within. (Becca sighs) Feel better? - Jack, you're friends with Sam. Do you know what I did? - You know, I'm kind of bad at this stuff. I just know they're kind of dating Judy. - Kind of? - Yeah, I think it's something that just, like, works out for them. Judy's not really in town that much because of her sales job, and Sam doesn't really talk about her much either, so how serious can it be? - Interesting. (phone buzzing) - Charlotte Reese. Is that the new girlfriend? - No, she's my manager. I'm not seeing anyone at the moment. - Shouldn't you take that call, then? - I would if I wanted to. - All right, I'm just looking out for your career. You know, that is, unless directing community theater is what you've been working up to. - Don't you have somewhere to be? - Yes, I do, actually. I am going to go volunteer at the animal shelter. Have a great day, sis. - Bye. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (door creaking) (door thuds) - Brandon, we are on a top secret mission. - To get Sam and Becca together? - How did you know? - Either that or we're robbing a bank. How can I help? - All right, so I'm going to get Sam to run an errand that takes them by Tilly's house between 3 and 3:15. - [Tilly] And I'm going to ask Becca to decorate the front porch, something that Sam usually does. - What is she doing? - [Tilly] The lights are usually very organized, but this year, I am going to tangle them up. (music continues) (door thuds) - Say, you need some help? You practicing a routine? Because that's a whole lot of twirling. - Ha ha. - I take it you learned those moves on Broadway? - Look. Stay if you're going to help. Otherwise, just go. - Yeah, you need some help. - The reindeer has landed. Repeat, the reindeer has landed. Regroup at eagle's nest. - Is that the house? - Yes, that's the house. - 10-4, over and out. (ominous music continues) - Twirl for me, come on. One more. Okay, wait, stop. Other way. Pause. You're good, okay. - Okay. - Oh boy. Wait, hold on. - Thank you. - Yeah, looks great. Why didn't Tilly call me? - My brother should be helping me with this. - Oh yeah, he and I normally take care of it. Make a whole afternoon out of it. - That sounds fun. - It is. - How's Judy? I haven't seen her around. - Wow, I really wasn't expecting that one. - I'm asking as a friend. Friend to friend. - You all right? You don't really seem like yourself. - What do I seem like? - Stressed. You want to talk about it? - Okay, so you want me to share, but you won't talk about your stuff? - All right, all right, that's fair. Judy's fine. She's on the road a lot. Right now she's in Nashville with her parents for the holidays. - So you don't see her much? - No, about once a month or so. - Is it serious? - Serious as we both want it to be. Now you. - One of those days. - I know when something's really bothering you, Becca. - I remember when the most important decision I had to make was between a ponytail and a braid. - Yeah, adulting can be hard. - Yeah. I miss talking to you. - I miss talking to you, too. Let's change that for the next few weeks, till you leave? - Yeah? - We can start with an apology. - I'm sorry- - No, not you. I'm sorry that I've been avoiding you. I just didn't really know how to handle you suddenly reappearing in my life. Forgive me? - I'll forgive you if and only if you do the happy clappy reindeer dance. - Absolutely not. You promised I'd never have to do that after the second grade. - These are extenuating circumstances. - You pinky promised. - You were the cutest backup reindeer ever. Come on. Fine, I'll get it started for you.

(cheerful music) (cheerful music continues) (cheerful music continues) (cheerful music continues) (cheerful music continues) I might want that. - You know, he can eat an entire pizza in one sitting. - Yeah, I remember when you came to visit me in the city and you insisted we order three pizzas for the two of us. - New York City pizza's the best. - Your father liked pizza, too. - Oh, Mom, I got this. - I got it. - You sure? - Yes. - I'm happy we could have dinner like this. I feel like I've barely seen you. School keeping you busy, or is it maybe a girl? Mary Jo? - It's definitely not Mary Jo, or any girl. - I think she likes you. - Yeah, well, I'm busy. I've got D&D with the guys, and then I'm volunteering at the animal shelter. - Mom told me. You seem to really enjoy it. - I love it. I think I might actually go to school to become a vet. - Jack, that's great. - Yeah, I get animals better than I do people. - Dad loved animals. I remember when I was really little, he would constantly take in strays or feed the cats that lived under the porch. - I didn't know that. Mom never mentioned that before. - Yeah, it's probably because it drove her crazy. - You know, your father would be proud of the both of you. (doorbell ringing) - I got it, Mom. - Hey, hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, I just, my mom bought your mom a wreath because they were selling out real fast, and she didn't want her to miss out. - Thanks, she'll love it. - Here you go. Wow. - We just got started on dessert. - Oh, I don't want to intrude. - Mom made coconut custard pie. - She makes the best coconut custard pie. - And a fresh pot of coffee. - Can't say no to that. (cheerful music) - Sam, what a nice surprise. - Yeah, Mom got you a wreath. - Nice one, Lucille. - What? - Tell her I said thank you. - Oh, yeah. - I'll grab you a coffee. - Thank you. - Hey, Jack. You text Mary Jo yet? - Tomorrow. - All right. - There you go. Sorry. - This is really good. - Yeah, you're welcome. (camera clicks) - Mom! - I have to capture the moment. (cheerful music continues) - Thank you. - Oh my gosh. - Every year. It's so good, thank you so much. - It is so good, Mom. - I'm so glad I interrupted dinner.

That's for Sam. You know, they should've been here by now. - I told them we were getting started at 7:30 with or without them, so, soon. - Evening, everyone. I got held up at the school helping Ms. Wilkinson. I'm sorry. - I'm just so glad you're here. Now go, go go go. Go put on something festive. All right, I'm so excited that we're all here together. - Me too, I love that outfit. - Thank you. - Eggnog, thank you. - You're welcome. - All right, let's get this Christmas tradition started. Jack, you are on garland duty. Bob, you do such a lovely job with the lights every year. Do your magic. Tilly, Becca, and Sam, we are going to sort through these ornaments. All right, let's, we can get started with this box right here, and oh, you know what? The pizza's going to be here soon. I better go get the plates ready. - I'll help. - Ooh. - Those two are like Frick and Frack. - I know. (both laughing) I wish we were on garland duty. - Yeah, we'll sort through this in no time. (Becca laughs) (cheerful music continues) (cheerful music continues) (cheerful music continues) (cheerful music continues) - Look at them. - We are so close. - Wilkie said they have been working together like happy little elves in Santa's workshop. - And the memories are coming back! We've got to seal the deal here. - Oh, I have just the thing. I found it the other day. Leave it to me, Tilly. - So, so he ran home that day, all the way home from the elementary school with a split in the back of his pants. - Yeah, you had a cute little butt then, too, didn't you? - Still do. - He wasn't wearing underwear. - Dad! - Can we change the subject? - Oh, hey hey hey, stop picking on Jack. All right, but let's continue to stroll down memory lane. - Mom, what are you doing? - I was looking for ornaments, and I found these. - In my old closet? - You don't live here anymore, so hush. Take a look at that. Would you look at that? - Look at you two. Oh my god, this was in the second grade when Sam was doing the happy clappy reindeer dance. - Oh, happy clappy reindeer! - No, uh-uh. I'm taking that. - And look at this one, how old are you here? - That was the third grade. - This one's from Halloween. Aw. (somber music) How do you... Where... Did you give this to them? - What is it? - It's the playbill from "Musical". - That was your first starring role. - Where did you get this? Sam! Sam, wait. (door creaking) Sam. Sam. Sam, stop. That playbill, how do you even have it? - They give you one when you see the show. - You were there? - Row G, seat 12. You were great. - Why didn't you tell me or see me after the show? - Doesn't matter. - It does matter. After that, you texted me saying you were dating Judy. All this time, I thought it was random, but it was after you saw the show? I don't understand. - Becca, you were amazing. I mean, I knew you were talented, but I saw you in "Musical", and you were incredible. You are a Broadway star. I'm a small town bar owner. We're just on different paths. - I came back here to be with you. - I got to go. I'll see you tomorrow. (engine rumbling) (Becca sighs) - And poor Becca, we had no idea what to say to her once she came back inside the house. It's like we're back at square one. - They haven't spoken a word to each other. - But, like, seriously, Mrs. Sheridan, how do we make this happen? I ship them so hard. - They're totally OTP. (all whispering over each other) - Becca was so sad this morning. Look, we've got to fix this. - Ms. Wilkinson, do you think you can get the hammer out of Sam's toolbox without them noticing? - You've got it. Consider it done. No one would ever suspect little ole' Wilkie. - What are y'all doing? - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. - Well, you found us. Listen, I have to run. - You all need to rehearse. What's actually going on here? - We're just having an emergency town meeting. - What emergency? I didn't hear anything- - The show. - The parking. Parking for the show. - Where will we put the cars with Becca directing? - The cars will go where they usually go. - That would work, but we should have a plan B. You can never be too prepared. - Okay, well, Brandon and the cheerleaders need to come with me, please. - We have only two days until showtime. Tilly, you're with me. We have a very busy night ahead of us. Come on. (wood clattering) - What happened? Is everyone okay? - Well, I just went to adjust this part and it just fell apart. - The base is ruined. - I know, we need a new one quick. - Well, I'm sure we got something here. - No, I've called Pastor Teddy at First Presbyterian, and he has one. You and Becca need to run up and pick it up. - I can get it. - It's too heavy for one person. You both need to go, or this is ruined. Go. - Okay, Ms. Wilkinson. Yes, ma'am. - Go! (engine rumbling) (Sam sighs) - I think there's some shenanigans going on. - Shenanigans? - Yeah, I mean, the Nativity falling apart and us on this drive together, I don't know, seems weird. - Maybe. We need to talk. - There's nothing to talk about. - Sam, please don't shut me out. I want to talk about us. - There is no us. You're gonna go back to New York. (gravel crunching) Hey, Pastor Teddy. - Well, well, well, if it isn't Sam Sheridan and Becca Winters. - Yes, sir. We had a little incident with the Nativity. - Yes, well, Ms. Wilkinson called. There's the base. I'll go get the tree. - Appreciate it. Man, I hope he hurries up. It's freezing out here. - Did you miss me? - What? - Is that why you came to see my show? - Becca, I really- - I missed you every day. Why did you come to my show and not see me? - Your life is in New York, and mine is here. - It's a two hour flight! - Becca, you left for college and hardly ever came home. I lived for your breaks, and then you booked "Musical" and another show and another show, and you just plain forgot about me. - I never forgot about you. - We're different people now. - We might be different people, but we have the same feelings. - You've not been home for three years. - I know, I got caught up in my career, but I missed you, and I know you have feelings for me, too. I tried to move on, and no one compared to you. I never stopped thinking about you, about us. - Becca, I don't want to take away your dreams. - What good are dreams if you don't have the person you love to share them with? I know I've been gone. I made a mistake. But I want the chance to spend another Christmas with you and see if maybe you've thought about me, too. - Of course I have. Never stopped loving you. (romantic music continues) - [Pastor Teddy] Here you go. - Thank you. (romantic music continues) (romantic music continues) - Wait a second. (romantic music continues) (door creaking) - A lobster in a unicorn hat! Look who showed up to the party! Merry Christmas, Becca. - What are you doing here? - Who is this? - Charlotte was in the area, and she stopped by to drop off a lovely poinsettia. Isn't that thoughtful? - You just happened to be in the area of Evergreen, Tennessee? - I have clients in Nashville. - Oh, Sam, this is my manager, Charlotte Reese. Charlotte, this is my... Sam. - Hello, Sam. That explains a lot. - What? - Sam, how do you feel about warm weather? - Hey, everybody, why don't we go and sit in the dining room? I sure hope you guys are starving. I've got enough to feed a neighborhood. - Just one minute. Go ahead. I told you, after Christmas. - Oh my god, did you smell the lasagna? It looks delicious. (Becca groans) No exaggeration, I had to tell this one seven times. She couldn't believe she got the starring role. - She's always been our star. - Mom. - Oh, and I bet you she didn't even tell you about the offers from Hollywood. (all talking over each other) - Everybody, calm down. It's not a big deal. - My baby's going to be a movie star! - Oh, isn't that fantastic? - Are you gonna get to work with that Steve Guttenberg? I love those "Police Academy" movies. - What about Jennifer Lawrence? - None of this is happening. - There's a TV role she'd be perfect for, and that's just the beginning. - I love New York and I have an offer there too, right? - They're just workshopping that, so not really, and that's why the timing for this move would be perfect. - Okay, it's Christmas and I'm with my family. I don't want to talk about my career right now. - But we do want some of Tilly's pecan pie. - I'm gonna head out. It was a long drive up, and I'm beat. - You have to stay for Tilly's pecan pie. Sit, sit. - Dinner was wonderful. Thank you, you've been so welcoming. - I'll walk you to the door. Sam, would you grab Charlotte's coat, please? (melancholy music) - Becca, you have to make a decision. I'll talk to you tomorrow. (door creaking) - You're not going anywhere. I've seen this look before. You're about to bail, and I'm not gonna let you. Now listen to me, okay? - Okay. - I'm not going to LA, never was. Charlotte gets these ideas in her head, and she thinks she knows what's best for me. - She's your manager. That's her job. - Charlotte knows what's best for my career. - This is your dream. - She doesn't know what's in my heart or what I really want. She doesn't know why I came back to Evergreen or what's best for me. - Becca, I'm not gonna be the reason that you miss this amazing opportunity. - [Tilly] Are y'all having coffee with your pie? - I better get back. - Hey. Come on. (ominous music) - Hey. Sorry to interrupt. - What are you doing here? - I'm about to head back up to the city, but I need a decision. - I already gave you my answer. I'm not going to LA. I'm taking the workshop job in New York. - Becca, really think about this. - I have. - Oh, Becca! I need you a moment! - I'll be right back. (ominous music continues) - You're really gonna let her do this? - Becca makes her own decisions. - I think she makes them because of you. - Because of me? I don't think so. - Really? She leaves a thriving Broadway career in the peak of the holiday season to come back to Evergreen, a place where the pinnacle of her career is directing the Christmas show. Now Hollywood is waiting. I came back here to see what's keeping her from jumping at that opportunity, and I found you. We both know Becca's dreams are bigger than this. - Sorry about that. I already gave you my answer. I'm not going. But you should. - Let me know when you change your mind. - We should get back to work. (ominous music continues) - I was thinking we could order Chinese for dinner. - [Sam] All right. - Mexican? - Whatever you want. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - What happened with Charlotte? What'd she say to you? - She said you're giving up your career for me. - That's not true. - She's right, though. This is huge for you. You can't pass this up. - Why is everyone deciding my life for me? I know what I want. - You think you know what you want, but in one, three years, I don't want you looking back on it and thinking about what could've been. You could have so much more than just Evergreen. - I don't want to go to LA. - How do you know? - Because I just do, and even if I did, why wouldn't you come with me? - Becca, I don't fit into your life. - You don't believe that. - You have a future that's filled with success. You don't want me walking down the red carpet with you. That's not who I am. You should go to Hollywood. See if that's where you want to be. - I'm tired of having this conversation, Sam. You're right. I don't want to be with someone that's so easy to give up on us. (melancholy music) (melancholy music continues) (door thuds) (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) - Thank you so much for all your help, Becca. - It was wonderful to be a part of the Christmas pageant. Brings back memories. My first applause, my first solo. It's how I knew I wanted to be up on stage. - We were all rooting for you and Sam. - You were? - Yes, sometimes people just don't have the sense to get out of their own way. They'll realize their mistake. You two were made for each other. - I thought so, too. - Well, it's not over yet. Everyone loves a happy ending, especially me. (angry rock music) (fist thudding) (fist thudding) - Why are you doing this to my sister? - What? - Why are you hurting my sister? You love her, right? She loves you, obviously. - Jack, this is... - You're always telling me that life is only as hard as you make it. - Yeah, well, this is different. - How? - Some things just aren't meant to be, all right? Your sister is a star. I'm just me. - Well, you sound like a doofus. This whole town loves you, and everyone that meets you does too. You're one of the most kind and thoughtful people on this entire planet. You're always telling me to be brave and to take risks. You're the one that told me to take a risk and tell Mary Jo that I liked her. - Did you? - Yes. - How'd it go? - Really good. But don't change the subject. You're letting fear get in the way of love. - Okay, all right, so maybe I am scared. So what if I am? Your sister deserves the world. I don't think I can give that to her. - But Becca thinks that you can. You see all of the reasons that make it hard, but what this town sees is two idiots that have been in love forever and just need to be together already. - The whole town does not see that. They do? - Duh. - That's a lot of people. - Yeah, it is. And the crazy part is that the only thing that's standing between you and the person that you've loved forever is yourself. (Sam sighs) - So I pushed her away. - You got to fix this, Sam. - I will. - [Arcade Machine] Oh, sorry, baby. Put the money in. - You have a dollar? - [Becca] Hey, you've reached Becca. Leave a message. (phone ringing) Hey, you've reached Becca. Leave a message. - Ms. Wilkinson, may I borrow your phone to call Becca? - Sam, Becca left. - I know, and it's all my fault. She won't even answer my phone calls, but maybe if I call from your phone, she'll actually pick up. - Give it a try. - I can't believe I messed all this up. You think she'll forgive me? - Sam, I knew you were perfect for each other when you worked on "Peter Pan". I saw the joy it gave you when you helped Becca fly. That's why you're like peanut butter and jelly. You love helping her fly, and you're the one she wants when she lands. - I understand that now. - Well, you're going to have to make a big, bold move to get her back. - I can do that. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Becca. It's me, Sam. - [Becca] I don't want to talk to you. - It's all my fault. Please just give me two seconds, no. I got scared when you left for Broadway and you didn't come back, and three years is a long time, but it's not long enough for me to get over you. Please, come back. - It's too late, Sam. I'm on my way to the airport. - Becca, please. I can do this. - [Becca] I don't know, maybe you're right. We're on different paths. - Please come back, let me show you. Let me show you that I can do this. - [Becca] I don't know. I got to go. - Oh darling, I'm so sorry. But you know what they say, the show must go on, and this one goes on in 15 minutes. - Yes, ma'am. Thank you. (cheerful music) (cheerful music continues) (audience cheering) - "'Hope' is the thing with feathers" by Emily Dickinson.
