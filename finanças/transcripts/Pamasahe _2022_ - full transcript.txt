All good. Get in, sir. Sir, somebody cut in line! There she is! Hey! That girl! We've been standing in line for hours! Ticket? Where's your ticket? Do you have a ticket? Ticket? - Okay. - Ticket? Bro. Isn't that the girl? Where's your ticket? She got in without a ticket? Yeah. This one doesn't have a ticket. Mister! Mister! Excuse me, sir. Where's the bus station for Nueva Segovia? Nueva Segovia? It's far. You have to hire a taxi to take you there. Can't I walk the whole way? I don't have money. It's a long walk from here. Especially with a baby. Hire a taxi to take you. Mister, could I ask you for spare change? I came all the way from the Visayas. The typhoon destroyed our house. I just really need to get to Nueva Segovia to find my husband. Anything you can spare. Ask someone else, miss. I still have to deliver this. Sorry. Ma'am! Your purse. Ah, thanks, miss. I keep all my fare money in here. Thanks so much. Thank you. Ma'am, maybe you could let me ride with you? Please, ma'am. Okay, come with me. - Okay, come with me. - Just to the bus station. Baby, look. Here. I hope this helps you even a little. It's all that I can spare. I only bought exact fare. Take care, both of you. Thanks for this. Take care, too. Miss sexy, those look healthy. After your baby, can I go next? Come on! Let me go next. I'll be gentle. Don't be rude, man. Nah. - Don't disrespect her. - She's so sexy. That’s my mommy. - She's mine, asshole! - Right, miss? When you're done, may I try? No, it's my turn! Hey! What do you think you're doing? Why are you in the way? You looking for trouble? - Sorry, sir. - Sorry. Sorry. Get lost! Don't be jerks! Sorry. Miss, can I take this seat? Please prepare your fare money. I'll collect them now. Where to, boss? Gapan, sir. Gapan? How many? Two? Two tickets. How about you Sir? Segovia. Segovia. Segovia. By bus? Two? Excuse me, mister. Mister policeman. Could you help us? If not for me, for my baby. - Shh. - Segovia? First off, what kind of help you need? Second, I'm not really a police officer. I just wanted to scare off those bastards earlier. Sorry to ask you, mister… But I don't have enough for fare. I come all the way from Visayas. The typhoon destroyed our town. I was wondering if you could spare some change. So I can have a bit more pocket money. Please, mister. Take pity on me. I just really need to get to Nueva Segovia. Don't worry, I'll pay for your fare. - Sir. - Bro, two tickets to Segovia. From where, sir? Ah, we got on the station. - The station. - Yes. - She's with you? - Yes, sir. Thanks, mister. What was your name again? I'm Lineth, by the way. I'm from Visayas. The typhoon destroyed our town so all my relatives moved out, too. I'm off to find my husband who's working in Nueva Segovia. You've got it rough. You can stop calling me 'mister'. Just call me 'Rod.' You're Lineth, right? Okay, sir. Don't have to call me 'sir' either. Just Rod. Okay, sir. Ah, Rod. Sorry. There. Much better. Couldn't get a smile out of you earlier. At least now you're laughing a little. Since we'll be on the road for a good while, about four hours, why don't you tell me about your life? Nevermind, mister. You'll just feel sorry for me. If you only knew, you'd be in tears. You say you don't want to tell me but you keep giving hints. I guess. I'm sorry. There, you're starting to lighten up. You looked like the world's against you. Yeah, I felt really lost earlier. I really don't have any money. Since we got on that ship and over on this bus, we were begging for food and change just to get to my husband in Nueva Segovia. I went through hell on that ship. Hang on. I don't understand. Why is your husband in Nueva Segovia? And you're from Visayas. Listen, I'll tell you about it but I hope you don't judge us too harshly. Because back home, people who know about our story, they look down on us. We were very young when my brother and I became orphans. Papa died in an accident. They said I wasn't old enough to remember. I was five when he was run over by a truck. Mom didn't take it very well. She was heartbroken. She neglected herself. And us, too. They told us she developed a mental illness. Then one day, they found her dead. She hanged herself. Lita! Why did you do that? A relative had to take me and my brother in. But one day, our aunt took us to the plaza. Sit over here, okay? - Here? - Yes, yes. We won't be long. We'll just take a walk, okay? Hey! Eds! Did you wait long? Yes. Here's my nephew he's the one I've been telling you about. Thank you. To, be a good boy. They said my brother just disappeared. They couldn't find him. When we got home, I was inconsolable. I was so afraid. I didn't have a brother anymore. They couldn't find him anymore. They said they'd searched everywhere. Even in the next town. But he was just gone. So I grew up alone with my aunt and uncle. What's worse, I was always scared because my aunt bullied me. She would say I wasn't her real child. That I was just a burden. Man, that's intense. You'd better eat or drink something. Here. Take a break. It's good. Want some? - I'm okay. - You can have half. No, it's fine. Thanks. Water. If you want more, I have more food. You look like you could eat some more. Are you shocked? I told you I had a terrible past. Let me just finish this. I'll get back to my story later. When I turned 16, I was usually left at home. That's the first time my uncle molested me. Shh, be quiet! Be quiet! Please, don't… I'll kill you! Sorry for what happened to you. Your uncle's crazy. Where is he now? Didn't your aunt do anything? You don't need to apologize, Rod. You had nothing to do with it. I didn't tell anyone because my uncle threatened me. What's wrong with you? She doesn't believe me. She just beats me up, and calls me a liar. Since then, she had me sent to Quezon City. I worked as a waitress there. I was looking after their small eatery, too. I didn't go to college anymore so their cousins ​​helped me take a vocational course. That's where I learned to massage. Your story's dragging on. All I wanted to know was about your love story. What happened to you and your husband? Tell me that. Don't worry, I'll get to that. Be patient. You'll find out in a bit. I lived in Quezon City for four years. But while I was here in Manila, my aunt called me. Lineth! Lineth! Someone's calling you. They said a man came to their house in Negros claiming to be Toto. My long lost brother! So my aunt gave him my address in Quezon City. And one day, that man suddenly showed up where I live and said he was my brother! Lineth! Lineth! At first, I couldn't believe it. But I slowly recognized his face. And I felt it in my heart… it really was him! I threw my hands around him and we cried together. After that, he took me to Nueva Segovia. And he made me live there with his wife, Shiony. They have been married for two years but they still have no children. Shiony is so pretty, and very sexy. You see, she works in Japan! I thought she was mean and wouldn't make me feel welcome. But later on, we really warmed up to each other. She even taught me to take better care of myself. How to dress up and do my makeup. You are so beautiful. Since my brother took me in and we were all living together We're each other's only family left. Ever since Shiony went back to Japan, he would always bring home gifts for me after work. He would buy me new clothes, and would take me to see places. He must have been making up for times lost. I got you your own soap, toothbrush, toothpaste. But you know, that's not the only thing I learned living in my brother's house. That's where I became aware of... You know… Sex. You know what? I always hear them doing it in the next room. Since then, I've been sneaking a peek at them whenever they're going at it. God, they were doing all sorts of things in different positions! I used to be jealous of Shiony. I said to myself, it must be nice to have a man. Shiony seems to enjoy it a lot when my brother's ramming into her. I just bite my lips from envy. Hold on. You're just telling me all these sex stories. Why won't you tell me your love story? That's what I want to know. My brother… He's my husband and the one who got me pregnant. What the... Did I hear you right? I asked you who's the child's father. And you're telling me it's your brother Toto? You heard right. My brother Toto is the father of my child. Shiony was away for a long time. Her contract abroad kept getting extended. We saw how much like a married couple we were. I want you to do to me what you do to Shiony. What? We knew it was wrong. We were living in sin. But what should never happen, happened between us. We were so attracted to each other until it got to a point where we were having sex a lot. Especially since Shiony wasn't around. I fill in for the sadness and longing he feels for his wife. Until our sin bore fruit. My own brother planted a baby inside me. Lineth? Lineth? Are you okay? We couldn't let anybody know. So while Shiony was gone last year, because Japan went on a lockdown, my brother decided to bring me home to the Visayas. To live and give birth there for the time-being. I'm pained by what happened. Once again, I felt depressed while carrying the child. There were times when I wanted to abort the child. My sadness went on until I gave birth. My brother wasn't by my side. I felt alone and abandoned. Lineth? Lineth. Don't cry in here. Get it together. Wipe your tears. Stop crying, Lineth. People might think I made you cry. Rod, I know it's too much but... Can I borrow your phone? I just need to call my brother. Sure. But it's prepaid so just hurry up. It might run out of credits. Do you know his number? Yeah, I have it memorized. I'll be quick. Damn it, the call won't connect. Maybe he changed his number. Actually, he doesn't know we're coming to see him. Can I borrow it again later? - I'll just try again. - Sure, no problem. The victims are Chief Security Sgt. Melchor Mercado and his two men... Passengers for San Rafael get ready. We're here. Check and keep an eye on your belongings. Thank you very much. By the way, Lineth. What's the plan when you get to Segovia? How are you going to tell your brother's wife about that baby? Shiony returned home last month. She already knows what happened. We couldn't keep it a secret from our neighbors. She found out soon enough from her friends in town. I don't know what to tell them, honestly. I wouldn't trade places with you. Your life's like a tv series. What's your baby's name, by the way? Ah. This is Lindsay. My beautiful baby girl. Lineth, it might be a good idea for you and your baby to freshen up or take a shower when we get to the stopover. To keep the baby safe. Can you tell me your complete name, sir? Besides, what do you do? Do you have a family? Kids? Wife? I am Rodolfo Padilla, Jr. I'm a seaman. I went to Manila to settle my required documents. In a week, I'll be boarding the luxury ship. And I'm single, and ready to mingle. So you're a seaman. Why? Do you have something against our occupation? My conscience is clear. I didn't have money to buy a ticket. I just took a risk boarding that ship bound for Manila. I managed to slip in but they caught me... The ship's security guards. They took me to the Chief Security's office. That's where my hellish nightmare began. With those fucking monsters. Who's this? Why'd you bring her here? Sir, we caught her skipping the line. No ticket. Trying to get a free ride, I think. The ticket doesn't even cost that much. Why'd you board the ship without a ticket? Do you think this is a charity? We've got people working hard so they could afford a ticket to this ship. And you expect a free ride? I'm sorry, sir. I just don't have any money. No money for fare. What do you want us to do with you? Should we throw you off the ship? Please don't! I just really need to get to Manila. I'm really sorry. We no longer have a house to return to in the province. My husband is in Nueva Segovia. I just need to get there. You're looking for your husband, are you? That's what you all say when we catch you. I'm tired of those same excuses. What's in there? - Sanchez. - Sir. - Check her bag. - Okay, sir. She might be hiding some cash or jewelry. Maybe she can pay with something else. Sir, I'm sorry. That's all I have. - Sir. - You can take all of it. This model is ancient. What am I supposed to do with this? It's useless. Here. God. Sanchez. Just take a picture. I already did, sir. I'll report her to the office later. Filed a blotter, too? Yes, sir. We're in the clear, then? Yes, sir. But sir, she stinks. But her skin looks smooth. Hand them your baby for now. - Sir? - Give it to me. - Go on. - Let me hold your baby. - Just do it. - Please, sir. - Nothing's gonna happen to her. - Don't take my baby. - Let go. Nothing's gonna happen. - Come on. Just give it. Please have mercy. - Come on. - Not my baby. - Please, sir. - Give it to me. I'll take care of it. Hush, hush, baby. - My baby… - It's okay, baby. - Please, don't hurt her. - Alright now. - Don't take her away. - No more crying. It's all right. I'll call for you. You got it, sir. Take your clothes off. Take that off. I don't want to. Go on. I don't want to. Take it off. - I don't want to. - Go on. - I'm taking my clothes off. - Please. Sir, have mercy. Your baby, there. We have your baby. My baby… Get undressed. Go on. That's it. Your shirt, too. - Hurry up. - Please don't, sir. Remove them. I don't want to. Think about your baby. Hurry up, so we can get it over with. Touch it. Touch it. Go on, hold it. It will be over soon. Go on. Do it. Hold it. Put it in your mouth. Later. Take her later. - Sir. - This won't take long. - It will be over soon. - My baby... Give me back-- This won't take long. It'll be quick. - I said it'll be quick! - My baby! Stop fussing! I don't want to! Stop moving! It's gonna be quick. Stop fussing or I'll kill you! I'll fucking throw you out, I swear. I said shut up. It's gonna be quick. Stop fussing or I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Come here. Your turn. Mister! , Sir! Give her something to eat. Yes, sir. Sit here. And this too... What are you waiting for? Sit here. Sit. Eat. You know the drill. Don't tell anyone. You know what will happen to you. Understand? Go ahead. Eat. Can you even pay us, you assholes? This isn't some fuck now, pay later scheme. Yeah, you brokeass perverts. Not even phone credits or e-cash. You're the ones who owe us. We allow you to get on board this ship. Right. You score how many clients being here? Two? Three? Fuck, you should be giving us a cut. You think you can just do your business without paying your dues? No such thing as a free lunch. Go ahead. We'll look out for you. Massage some aching balls in here. How much? Go on. Do your thing. Thanks. Good evening, ma'am. Can I sit here for a while? There? Nobody's staying there. Good evening. Good evening, ma'am. Are you a masseuse? This is my side-hustle but my own back hurts. It's cramping. It won't let me sleep properly. It really hurts. You know, ma'am, I know how to massage, too. If you want, I could help relieve your back pain. All right, please, dear. Let me put my baby down here. It hurts. Must be a stubborn knot. Okay, please turn around. Yes, please. Right there. Ouch. - There we go. - that storm, our roof was blown off. our roof was blown off. Oh, my god! We were all soaked. And then my back started hurting. Ma'am, do you have efficascent oil there? Ah, yes. I always carry oils with me. Here, here. I always have it here. Coconut oil and various types of herbs. This is effective. Go on. Keep going, dear. Ouch. There. How does it feel, granny? Oh, yes. You are a good masseuse, It hurts a bit but it also feels good. You see, I took up a vocational course as a massage therapist. So I know a few things. There we go. Oh, thank you. Here it is. Is it better? Ah, yes. I feel better. All right. Always remember to apply oil, okay? To reduce your back pain. I'll remember. Granny, what's all those seeds? What are they for? These are seeds of herbal plants-- But please keep it quiet, dear. It's a secret. I gathered these seeds from the mountains and forests of Visayas. These seeds, are not herbal medicine. These are poison. You can use them against your enemies or against bad people. Listen to me carefully, this one is an order for my customer from Binondo. He asks me to look for unique herbal plants with poisonous properties and they process them. I don't know who buys them from him, but a lot of customers are looking for these. How do you mean poisonous? This, for example. This one is called Butang-butang. It is obtained from soil where Mangroves grow. and it's dangerous because it contains a toxic sap more commonly known as milky juice or latex. One drop of this in your eye, you'll go blind in an instant. This is called Katana. It comes from the castor plant. We know that castor oil can treat various types of diseases. But this one, it's more dangerous if a person ingests even one of these seeds, one might feel a burning sensation in his throat. They might have diarrhea, vomiting, and within three to five hours, they will die. This one is called Rosary P or better known as "Matang Ire". Ah, I know this one. They make these into bracelets. Protects babies from the evil eye. This is the most dangerous of all. You swallow one of these seeds and in mere moments, you'll be dead. That's how dangerous this seed is. More dangerous than the first two. It is more poisonous, but all these three are dangerous. Granny, can I sleep here? We don't have a ticket so we don't have a bed to sleep on. It's for my baby. - I can sleep on the floor. - You silly! Both of you sleep on that bed. It's not taken. You can have it. Go ahead. You two sleep there. Thank you, Granny. Miss. Miss. Sleep later. The captain wants you. Come with us. Give her your baby. Hurry up! She might cry. Just let her take care of it. Come on. Granny, take the baby. Granny, I'll leave her with you for a bit. - Come in. - Captain. She's the girl we told you about. Okay. Okay, go in. Captain wants to meet you. Come in. Go in. My boys told me you're the one who got on my ship without a ticket. Carrying a baby at that. Is it even your baby? Why don't you answer? Chief Mercado told me that you're a masseuse. Is that true? Yes, sir. Really now? Come sit close to me. Come here. Just sit. Lighten up. There's nothing to be scared of. And I heard that, you provide extra service? I am not offering extra service. Oh? They just forced me. They threatened me and exploited me. My only fault was I got on the ship without paying. We were devastated by the typhoon. We lost our home. I gave birth without a penny to pay the hospital. I didn't have my husband by my side either. So this is how it's gonna go. To be honest, you're right. You tried to get a free ride, that's it. But, can you offer something to make us look the other way? I ask for a simple thing. If you could massage me. You okay? Where do you want to start? Up here or down here? Don't be afraid. Are you sure? What about your crime? I'll throw you into the sea. Please no. Get on with it. Can you do it? All right. Didn't you say there's a special offer? Let's do it. Are you for real? I can't believe it. Lineth, we can sue them if you want. That's rape, if you think about it. I told you. They're monsters. Nevermind. Karma will get to them. Who knows, they could be dead by now. What was that? Did you say they're dead? Nothing. Shit, you know what, let's take a break. We've been talking for a while. Okay. Get some sleep, Rod. You haven't heard all of it. If you only knew, you'd be afraid of me. You're back. - Who were those people? - They're monsters. What have they done to you? I need your seeds. Lord have mercy on you. - Cheers! - Cheers! Oh, still hanging around, are you? What do you want? Where can I get the captain's drink? Over there. In the kitchen. Get the whiskey. That's what he likes. Boss, we're out of drinks, too. - Hold it right there. - I need more, too. Open up some bottles for us, too. Do it. - Cheers. - Cheers. You really wanna get hammered. Your bottle's empty. Caridad seems drunk already. I can drink more. What was that, boss? I said, you've had your drinks filled. More than our fill. Can you stand up? Our drinks are here. So you're our waitress now, too? Oh, Cheers. - Thanks, sexy! - Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy. - Wow. - Come back later, yeah? Telling us to enjoy ourselves, huh? You'll be our appetizer. Cheers! I can't breathe. My hands are going numb. I'm getting dizzy. Shit, Captain. Could be your blood pressure? Should I call a doctor? No need. I'm sure it's nothing. For the mean time, you take charge, okay? I'll step out for some fresh air. We're almost at the port anyway. - I'll be right back. - Okay, Captain. Hey. What's your plan once we get to the pier? What'll happen to you and your baby? To be honest, I don’t know, granny. But take care of yourself, won't you? And don't forget to apply oils on your back. I'll miss your massages. I want you to know how grateful I am for your help. It meant a lot, granny. Come. Can I get a hug? Thank you, granny. You take care of yourself, and take care of your baby. Take care of her. Thank you, granny. Be safe always. I'll go ahead. Hello. You'd better stop the trip, The winds and rain are too strong, it's flooding because of the storm, it's signal number four. Sorry, dear passengers. I just have an announcement. We will not be able to continue our journey because the rain is quite heavy in Candava and it's been flooded. But don't worry. Our bus station will pay for your lodgings tonight so you can rest comfortably. And for everyone's safety, we shall continue the journey tomorrow. Please bear with us. Thank you very much. San Leonardo's flooded. We can't pass through Candava. Wait there. I need to make a call. I need to get home. We need to get home tonight. What about our family? I can't make any calls. No service. If you want, we can go down at the stopover. Let's have something to eat. That alright with you? Is that so? I was going to ask if I could make a call. But nevermind. I can try tomorrow. Okay. No choice. Maybe there'll be phone service at the station. When you're done eating, the hotel's right this way. Courtesy of our bus station for your convenience. We'll continue with our journey first thing tomorrow. Thank you all. I ordered rice, ginger chicken soup with horseradish for you. Good for your breast milk. Really? Thanks. Thanks for being so nice but I really have nothing to pay you with. I'm so embarrassed but you truly are a blessing to me and my baby. If it wasn't for you, we've have been let off the bus and starving somewhere. Thank you, really. It's nothing. We're like friends by now. Are you full? Yes, I haven't had delicious food in a long time. Thanks, Rod. I'll treat you - if you want some more. - No, I'm good. - You sure? - It's okay. We'll see you later. Wait here.

LIneth. Second hand cell phone. My gift to you. Yeah, right. Seriously? Yes. You're giving this to me? Yeah, I saved my number, too. It has call credits. This is too much. I can't accept it. No, you'll need that. So you can call your brother. I mean your husband. Here, keep this for your trip. You'll need it. This is way too much. I'm very grateful. You're too kind. Lineth, if you really want to say thank you, maybe you'd like to keep me company in my room. Thank god. We can rest now. My joints are killing me. At least here, we have a bed, a TV, and air conditioning in here. We can take it easy for a few hours. Don't be afraid of me, okay? I'm not like other men. I'm nice. I'm just concerned about you and your daughter. You should get changed. She's asleep. Take a shower. Sorry. You're probably thinking I took advantage of you. I was just carried away by your stories and the cold weather. Nah, no need for that. I felt it back on the bus. I knew we'll end up here. A man wouldn't approach a girl like me without an agenda. Am I right? Fess up. I caught you looking. You were peeking at my nips while my baby sucked on them. Stop pretending. I turn you on, don't I? I can't believe you! You mean all this time you thought I was a creep? You think I'm a pervert? Yeah! You're a son of a bitch. You were lapping my pussy like a starved dog. You were sucking on my tits harder than my baby. You talk big about not being a horndog. All men, I swear to god. You're just after our pussy. After you get what you want, you'll leave us. Tomorrow, you'll be gone. No one really cares about me. I'm just your plaything. Hello, love? I'm fine. But we can't pass through San Leonardo road tonight. So I checked into a hotel by the highway instead of sleeping on the bus. It's safer here. I'll be home in a few hours. Don't worry. Kiss the kids for me. And I love you. Okay? Wait for me. I'm coming home. You're swimming in poop. Hang on. What's all these bottles? Is your mom a witch or something? Let me change your nappies. You're stinking up the place. Son of a bitch. You're a boy? Your mom told me you're a girl. Why do you have a pee-wee? Your mom's a little cuckoo, isn't she? She called you Lindsay but you're a boy. Hold on. Hi, hello, miss. Your bus is leaving. It's also time for checkout. Okay, mister. Okay, miss. Miss. Excuse me. Where's the man you were with? The seaman is gone, mister. Eat up, sweetie. Adam, put that down. Gwen, take the gadget from your brother. Your noses are always buried in them. Rod, put that aside. The kids might see. Mistake it for a toy. Let's eat. A woman was incarcerated in Nueva Segovia after meeting with her brother and sister-in-law who allegedly tipped the police to help catch her because she is no longer in her right mind and have come to disturb their peace. Based on the report, the authorities have been searching for several days for Maria Linetha Sagum, twenty-three years old, from the town of Roxas in Capiz. CCTV footage shows she entered the canteen near the bus station with her accomplice, Rodolfo Padilla, Jr. According to the police, the two were planning to sell the baby which they stole from a hospital in Capiz. Based on follow-up reports, this baby belongs to Mario and Lolita Esteban. This baby was stolen from a hospital in Capiz during evacuation operations due to severe flooding caused by typhoon Odette. I am here at the scene of the incident, Capiz Provincial Capitol, where Lineth Sagum's tried to escape. According to my interview Lineth fell into a depression since her newborn died. According to the hospital, she took one of the infants and thought it was her baby. Latest information places the suspect in Manila on her way to Nueva Segovia. If you have any information, please alert your local police. You son of a bitch! How dare you! You son of a bitch! You said you had things to take care of in Manila, is that what you were doing? Let me explain. That wasn't me! My children and I are leaving you! Anybody home? Good day. Is Rod at home? Anybody home? Rod is to blame for everything. He ordered me to do those things. Does Rodolfo Padilla, Jr. live here? Ma'am, a case has been filed against him. Child kidnapping and accessory to four counts of murder. Rod's the mastermind. Rod gave me the poisonous seeds. You can look in his bags, if you like. We still have some seeds left. I mixed those in with the guards' beers. Into the captain's drink, too. I poisoned them because they raped me on that ship. It was also Rod's idea to sell the baby. We're partners. Stop! Don't shoot! This is just a toy. I'll go with you. You're just after our pussy. After you get what you want, you'll discard us. Tomorrow, you'll be gone.
