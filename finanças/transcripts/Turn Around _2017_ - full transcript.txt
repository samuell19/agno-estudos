What the hell? Earthworms. Nonsense! They're millipedes. Where are they from? Gross! A magnitude 7.3 earthquake shook up Taiwan. When I came back to this town after 72 hours, I couldn't bear to look at the ruins, But I heard the words that changed my whole life. You can do it. Not yet. Come on. Come on... Take a look. Tangerine... Or watermelon. Watermelons are tasty. - No, they're not. Too many seeds. - Shut up! Hello? These are enough. Don't be too greedy. Yes! Yes! - I want apples. - 77! A watermelon. That's it. - A jingle. - Yeah, that's it. - We're winning with a jingle. - Excuse me. Where is Shuang-wen Junior High School? Tell him, or the shopkeeper's coming. Straight ahead from here past the cemetery and you'll see it. Don't ask further, or you'll get scared. We hit the jackpot! Come on, more! - See? Didn't I tell you? - Shut up. - Yeah, this one. - I want apples. You brats! If I catch you again, I'll kill you! Don't blow too hard, Biao. Nice, make him move. Like that... We have one more event to go. Yeah, go for it. Yeah, see you. Study hard, kid! Bye! - Yeah, bye! - Bye! Where are you going, girl? I'm going to Mandarin class. She's a little girl. Leave her alone. Don't bother. Run faster! You're the nation's hope! Hey, boy! Over here! I'm stuck here without my ladder. - Be careful. - Yeah. What are you doing here? I'm the new teacher, reporting to the principal. Okay. Come with me. Hey, come here! Good morning, Miss Shu-fen. Where are your uniforms? We came from the festival. What festival? This is our new teacher. Play something. Some music to greet him. Okay. Darn you! He's new here. He's not leaving yet. But we're good at this song. Shut up and go to class! Where are your manners? I'm sorry. This way. You're lucky to be teaching in our school. The air is clean and the scenery is beautiful. We have waterfalls as well. At the summer nights, there are fireflies everywhere. So beautiful! - Hi, Miss Shu-fen. - Hi. Go to class, kids. Here is our administration office. Hey, it's burning. Haven't you noticed? How long has it been cooking? Not long. Only 30 minutes. Wanna eat with us? Yeah. Come here, young man. He's a new teacher. Introduce yourself. Hi. I'm Wang Zheng-zhong. I was a Chinese major in NKNU. I'm here as an intern teacher. This is your desk. From now on, you're the chief of Student Affairs. You're in luck, Chief Wang. But it's up to the Principal to decide. So I called you Chief Wang. Is there something wrong? Miss Principal! The water pipe's broken in the toilet. Water keeps squirting from it. Call me Miss Shu-fen. I'll be there in a minute. What should I do? Everything. In such a country school, everyone has to do several jobs. I'm the principal, and I have to do everything else. And you're also the homeroom teacher of Class 1B. Let me introduce you to the prettiest teacher here. Show him around, Miss Pei-lun. The relationship of A when F equals to 10N and M equals to 5kg, 10N... N equals 2... He's our new intern teacher Wang Zheng-zhong. I thought he was the inspector. On a smooth plane... Miss Pei-lun is pretty! She has a boyfriend! That's Mr. One Foot. Mr. One Foot? You can call him Mr. Chiu. One day, he was so agitated by his students that he walked straight out of the classroom. The inspector was here, so he got punished. That's why he's standing like this, with one foot inside and the other one outside. It's a country school. The kids are out of control. Don't be scared off. Stand up! Go back to your seats. Give it to me. I'm Wang Zheng-zhong. Halt! Finished your games? Yeah. Did you win? What do you think? Give him back the money. Done that. Got caught? You deserve it. Sit down. I'm your homeroom teacher Wang Zheng-zhong. From now on... Who's Xin-ling? Xin-ling! Hey, stop! Come on, stand up. Read it out loud to her. Give him a round of applause. My dear Xin-ling... Dear? Marry him, marry him... Whenever I see you, my heart's beating fast. Wow! Maybe you never notice me, but your spirit's with me. Marry him, marry him... Where have you learned these? From the pen pal journals. "Your spirit's with me." Do you know what it means? Yeah, it means I feel her presence. You idiot! She's still alive. Are you in love with a dead person? Wow, dead person! Three, two, one. The family responds. Reply. Don't be such a stiff. You know what I mean. -E-A-G-L-E -That's cool. Repeat after me. Eagle. - Eagle. - Dinosaur. How do you spell it? Dinosaur. D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R. Dinosaur. Dinosaur. - Okay. - I want a dinosaur as my pet. - The word in the singular... - They're all dead. - How can you have one as a pet? - That's enough. - We have a pet here, Miss. - The word in the singular... A chihuahua. Shake hands. Jump, jump... What are you looking at? Come on, sit down. Sit down, Biao. Look at the blackboard, kids. The word in the singular... Come on, it's exercise time. Hey, what are you doing? Give it back! Let's play together. Let's practice together. It's volleyball. Chief Wang! Some students got involved in a fight. The police want you on the phone. Okay. Keep practicing, everyone! Look at me, girl Take a look at me I'm trying to please you here Please don't ignore me -I'm such a lonely boy -I'm sick of this song. You're too short. -No one understands me -You idiot! Please give me the glad eye And make me happy... What? I'm helping you. What the hell? Are you sure they're from our school? Yeah, I see. I'll talk to the principal. Thank you. Yeah, thank you very much. These are for you, Mr. Wang. Chief Wang? ...paper, rock! Hey, you three! - It's you again. - Go on! Ouch! - What is it? - I want to take a shit. Hang on. We're almost there. No, I can't. I can't. Hang on. Go back to your seat. I'm dying here. Help me. It's coming out. Excuse me. Can you please... ...stop the bus? Hey, be careful! I need to go to the toilet too! Yeah. Hurry up! Be careful! What have they eaten? Don't wait for them. Come back to school. They'll be back for lunch. You may enter when your clothes are dry. Line up! Take it off and dry it. No, I can't. Why not? Not in front of Xin-ling. What's it got to do with her? No, I can't. Come on! You're lame! But it's embarrassing. No. Come on! Take it off! - No! - Come on! Come on! Stay away! Leave me alone! - What? - Stay away. Leave me alone! Wanna try? - Come on! - Here I come. Yeah. I'm here. What? You don't think I'll do it? Come on. Hey, what the hell? What are you doing? Put the fire extinguisher down! - No scribbling. - Or we'll get punished. I'll blot them out. Hey! Wanna try? - It's him again. - Look at me, girl Out of my way! - Take a look... - You're silly. She said something to me. Oh yeah? DARN Take a puff! Come on! No, I'm dizzy. What? You haven't even touched it. Don't you have the guts? Come on! No! I'm dizzy. You're dizzy because you've got sunstroke. - Come on! - What about us? Take a puff! Come on! You're so lame! Where are the cigarettes from? We found them. I'll give you one more chance. You'll have a demerit if you don't confess. Where are they from? But it's no big deal. Demerits! None of your business! These liars have no shame at all! Yeah, I'm shameless. - Say it again. - I'm shameless. Say it again. I said I'm shameless. - Say it again! - Are you deaf? - Darn! You... - Come on! Come on! You smoked cigarettes, told lies and attacked your teacher. What next? Burn up the school? Mr. Wang, you have to be strict to these kids. Don't let them go unpunished. They're only kids, Mr. Wang. Don't be upset. Have some scallion pancakes. Here. Try some. Come on. We're sorry, Mr. Wang. Hello. Hey! Stop it! Stop it! Enough! Stop it! Hey! He's been punished. So... no need for the demerits, right? Calm down. What? The kids made a mistake, but why are you looking at me like it's my fault? They made a mistake, but... Have you thought about why? Why is it my fault? Forget it. Hi, Mr. Wang. You don't look good. Didn't sleep well? Miss Shu-fen? I've heard about an intern teacher... Oh, the one before you? Something tragic happened to his family, so he was transferred to another school. I can only be transferred if something tragic happens? No. You can if you're going to a graduate school, or if you do very well in our school. Why do you ask? What are you doing here? When will you say yes? - You idiot! - Go away! I love it when you talk to me. All right, everyone. - What is our teacher doing? - Let's have some fun. Let's have a competition. Accumulate points to get a prize. The prizes are in this box. What is he doing? - Alright. - Ignore him. Have you got your partners? So, let's begin. Question one. - What's the answer? - I know! Correct! Write it down! Team C! Tell me. What's the answer? - I know! - Zhang Ji or Li Bai? Ready? One, two, three! Being an official means... You! What is the answer? - Fame and power. - This is it. You're correct! Going to the woods means being a hermit. We have quatrains of 5 or 7 characters. Correct! Candies, candies... Team A has been discussing. How does it taste? Good. You insist on going against Mr. Wang, but I want the candies. You can buy them. But it's different. What's the difference? Yeah. Your students have made great progress. It's good for your performance review. Thank you, Miss Shu-fen. We'll have the parent-teacher meeting next month. You need to get ready. Will the attendance affect my performance review? Of course. But don't get your hopes up. Why? Most of the parents are working away from home. They don't have the time. - Bye, Mr. Wang. - Bye! Is your uniform too small, Poker? No. You're sweating all over, Poker. Oh my! - It's dangerous riding like that. - No, don't worry. - But it's dangerous. - Let's go! - Hey, it's dangerous! Get down! - Hey, Wang! - Bye, Mr. Wang. - Mu-sheng Scooter Repairs. Get gear oil for free. Mu-sheng Scooter Repairs. Get gear oil for free. - This one? - Yeah. - Sign here, please. - Okay. Right here. Thank you. Yeah. Here's your cooking oil. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Let's go to the classroom and... - Hi, Mr. Wang. - Hi. Don't run! - Let's talk to the teacher. - Yeah. - What's your kid's name? - Xie Qing-he. - Xie Qing-he... - This one. - This one? - Yeah. Sign here, please. - Okay. - Right here. He caught lots of frogs and brought them home. I couldn't sleep because they were croaking. Grandpa! Grandpa! Parent-teacher meeting? Over here. Do I get my cooking oil here? Yeah. Come on. What grade is your grandchild? The fifth grade. - What? Fifth grade? - Yeah. But it's a junior high school. Grandpa? Sign here for me, please. Yeah, but they need this at home. But you have to talk to the teacher. My wife needs the oil now. Grandpa! Grandpa! I'm not going against Mr. Wang anymore. I want the comic books too. What are you talking about? Don't you remember how he punished you? But he gave my mom cooking oil. He's bought you over with oil and comic books? Your grandma got a bottle too. You were punished for smoking. It's not fair to blame the teacher. He's a hypocrite. Whatever. I'm not going against him anymore. Yeah. Don't stop us. What about you, Fatso? Fatso! I'll give you one more chance. - Wanna come over? - Say no. Mr. Chiu? The county government wants us in the Chinese Music Contest. Do we have a Chinese Music Club? Are you kidding me? What do you mean? In Nantou County, only two schools have such a club, us included. But they never lose. What about us? Only a few students led by Miss Pei-lun are fumbling with their instruments. How do we compete? We'll lose face in a contest like that. Don't bother. That's right, a bit looser. Relax your wrist. Let's try. Relax. - Yes. - Teacher. One of my strings just snapped. Here. You practice. Let me have a look. Oh my! It needs to be replaced. What do we do? We don't have any more new strings. Then how do I practice? What do you want? How's everything in your club? Can I help you with anything? Is there anything wrong? Let's assemble an orchestra. An orchestra? I think music is great. Music helps build your character, good for developing good teamwork. But an orchestra? We don't have many members, and we don't have the money either. I don't think it's possible. We'll figure it out. Join us and have fried chicken once a week. Wow, fried chicken! - It's different from competition? - And... Much different. And more rewards for good performance. What are they? I can't tell you now. Great rewards. Hurry up! It's fun. Get off. - Are you fun playing in corridor? - Come on. You'll have your fried chicken. - Where's our fried chicken? - You'll get it. Sit down. - Come on, Poker. Sit down. - Come on, find a seat. Hurry up! Are you with me? How's your practice? This one's difficult. Then practice more. Yeah. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for my sister. Stop messing around! Sit down! Yeah, sit down. - Sit down, Fatso. - Have a seat. Come here. Sit down, Poker. Let me ask you something... What do we have for lunch? Beef. Miss Shu-fen? Miss Pei-lun and I want to assemble a traditional Chinese orchestra. But our instruments are old. We need some money to fix them. Chinese orchestra? Are you kidding me? If we have our own Chinese Orchestra, our students will have a better temperament. You're wasting your time. You know well what these kids are. And we don't... Enough! Come here, Pei-lun. Do we still have some money left for the maintenance of our schoolhouse? Give it to the Chinese Music Club. I've fixed everything by myself anyway. Let's give them a hand, okay? It's the money I've earned for you. Please cherish it. - Thanks, Miss Shu-fen. - Thank you. My dad passed away three years ago. It's still vivid in my memory. His students... the whole class visited him in the hospital. Wow! You know, half of the class couldn't keep studying. So I thought if it's the last diploma that they would have in life, I'll be a good teacher, like my Dad. I had a great teacher... ...just like you. Like me? Thank you. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll do it. Hi, Mr. Wang. I'll do it, sir. It's all right. Thank you, Mr. Wang for taking care of my grandson. Don't mention it. Why don't you say hello to your teacher? Okay. Let's go. Hey, Bigwig. These might be a little larger. Wanna try them on? - Go, Bigwig... - Go, Bigwig... - Go, Bigwig... - Go, Bigwig... Hello? Shuang-wen Junior High. Yeah. Chinese Music Contest? I'm sorry, but it must've been a mistake. We didn't sign up for the Contest. What? Fried chicken time! Fried chicken time! Come on. Take a break. While it's hot. Come on, Poker. - Have the biggest one. - Fried chicken. - It's for you. - Fried chicken. - Yeah. - Mr. Wang? Can you explain to me about the Contest? Why didn't you talk to me before you signed up for it? Didn't you tell me that you want a fair chance for the kids? I think the Contest will show them how big the world is and give them a sense of honor... I think you misunderstood me. If they compete now, they'll bring disgrace on themselves. You're hurting the kids. Nonsense! We should help them build confidence. No. Tell them that we quit. No quitting. Or we'll get punished with two-year suspension. But Mr. Wang... I'd rather let them practice for two more years than ask them to compete now. Only two entries. Either first place or second. Does it matter that much to you? You're doing it for your performance review? Grasshopper teases Rooster and Rooster jumps NANTOU STUDENTS' CHINESE MUSIC CONTEST They're all dressed up. - Unbelievable. - It's amazing. What the hell? Look at us! Come on. Be quiet. It's your turn now. Really? - It's too far. - But they're all dressed up. All right. Calm down. Don't be nervous. I'm going to the toilet. Not now. Go later. Yeah, I can hold it. Go for it. It's just another rehearsal. Have you got your scores? Let's go. Come with me. The second place... Shuang-wen Junior High. Here. Congratulations. Give them a round of applause. Second place... Look here! Second place! Look at me, kids Take a look at me What are you excited about? You've lost. -I'm trying to please you here -Seriously. We won. Mr. Wang? I don't know what you're thinking, but I feel bad when they laughed at my students. Miss Shu-fen? I want to know about... ...my application for transfer. I've been busy lately. Forgot to tell you that it's been turned down. Oh. Sorry. I can't help you. But you're serving in the army soon. We'll see to it when you come back. Scissors, paper, rock! Isn't it too dramatic? No. He's leaving us to serve in the army. All right. Let's go. Leave some for me. Watch out! It's spicy! Wait! It's not done and it's disgusting! I want toasts. Mr. Wang! It's for you! Mr. Wang... - Everyone signed on it. - Take a look. Come on, take a look! Take a look! - Open it! - Do you love us, Mr. Wang? Yes, he does. Will you visit us on holidays? - Yes! - Of course, he will. Yes, he will. You have to visit us, Mr. Wang. We'll miss you. Come on. Let's eat. Don't palter with us, Mr. Wang. I want some well-done chicken wings. What are you talking about? I'm off duty. Sign here. Your mail. You've got lots of girlfriends. - Give it to me. - Stop it! - I'll read it. - She'll read it. Why? Because you can't read it well. It's foggy in Kinmen. What does he mean by "foggy"? - A dense fog. - The airplanes can't fly. I can't go home now. And... I knew he wouldn't come. - What are you talking about? - He'll come. If not, he wouldn't write us a letter. - He wrote it because he's not coming. - Shut up! Be quiet! And you've got lots errors in your writings. - He means you. Don't look at me. - It's you. And you didn't want me to check for you. - It's you. - Not me. I can't tolerate it anymore. Behave yourselves and study hard. Study hard. He means you. I've been studying hard. You're slow, Biao! You're slow! Wait! You're so slow! Fatso... My goodness! What the hell? Earthworms. Nonsense! They're millipedes. Shit! Lots of them! - Hey, ride carefully, kids! - Why are they crawling inside? To worship gods? - Oh no! - Shut up! What's happening? What? - Oh no! - Be careful! Gross! I'm sleeping with you, Mom. Okay. Come on. Let me tuck you in. Get up, Sis! What? You're violent! Go away! Mom! - Get up! - Cheng... Sleep in your sister's bed tonight. No, I can't sleep without you. Hey, go to my room! - Only for tonight. - Yeah. Good boy. Come here. - That's my boy. Good night. - You're disgusting! Good night... Turn off the lights. Good boy. Go on! Don't fight with your brother, Xin-ling. What a prick! What an idiot! - Come on, it's bedtime. - Good night. Earthquake, Mom! Wake up! Wake up, Bro! Earthquake! Dad! Dad! - Earthquake! Get out of here! - Wake up, bro! Come on! Dad! Get out of there, Dad! Get out of there! Come on, Dad! Dad! Can someone help me? Please help me! Help me! Answer me! Grandma? Can someone help me? Where are you, Grandma? Grandma! Grandma! Grandma? Grandma... Don't go in! Get out of there! No! I want my grandma! Get out! My grandma's still inside. I know. I'll find her. Get out! No! At ease and attention, everyone. I have something to tell you. Those who're from Nantou, raise your hands. Put them down. A severe earthquake struck Nantou. The two of you will return home at 12:00. That's it. You're dismissed when I say "at ease". At ease! Mom! - Mom! Sis! - Bro! You're fine. You're fine. Come on, come on! Be careful! Here! Hurry up! Hurry up! My family! They're still inside! The noodles are ready. Here. Come on. Be careful. Run for life if there's another earthquake. Come on. Have some noodles. Fatso! Hi, Mr. Wang. I'll do it. - Put it here. - Yeah. Feed me, Bro. I can't use chopsticks properly. The Earthquake was horrible, Mr. Wang. I was so scared. Where's everyone? I haven't seen them. Yeah, I saw Yen-tao. I'll get her here. Yen-tao! Yen-tao... Miss Pei-lun... - Use the water economically. - Mr. Wang is back. Mr. Principal, he's Mr. Wang. I'm scared, Mr. Wang. Our house collapsed. The school was ruined. What do we do now? Don't be scared. Mr. Wang... Hi, kids. - Where's my dad? - It's horrible. My dad went to work and hasn't come back. I can't find him anywhere. Where is he? Help me, Mr. Wang. - Where is he? - I'm so scared. What do I do now? I can't find him. Who's taking me to school? Help me, Mr. Wang. Who's taking care of me? What do I do? Where's everyone else? Bigwig is in the hospital, wounded. Their house collapsed. His grandma is dead. Where's Biao? Their house collapsed too. How is he? He's dead. - He's dead. - He's gone. When are you coming back, Mr. Wang? I'm so scared. Will you come back, Mr. Wang? What are you doing here? You don't have to feel sorry for me. Go away! Where's my money? Where's the money I've earned in the factory? The money... You can earn more money. You know? It's the money for my cram school. Where is it? Huh? Get out of face! Darn it! What're you studying for? Mom? I'm leaving. I had to leave. I had to grow stronger before I return home to help you. Wang Zheng-zhong! Hi, Miss. Don't worry. It'll be fine. This is for your cram school. When you're able to sustain yourself, don't forget to help those in need. Go for it. Take care of yourself. Let's build up the temporary school as soon as possible for the kids to keep learning. I wanna thank all the teachers for their help. Let's move the chairs and everything else in place. Come on, let's do it. Let's get to work. Come on. Thank you. Let's go... - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Wang. Hi, Mr. Principal. Mr. Wang? What do you want? Hey! Mr. Wang is back. Since the Earthquake, the kids haven't been back to school. So I need all the teachers to find out how they are now and ask them to come to school. Maybe we'll do things flexibly. Let's change the curriculums and give them more activities. Where's Xin-ling? I know you're upset. But get yourselves together. Let's contact those who're not here. As for those... ...who're not with us anymore, let's pray for them. Here, Mr. Wang. Have some fruit. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Go get yourself a chair, Xin-ling. Don't just stand there. - Please, Mr. Wang. - Thank you. What happened to the fruit? The teacher's here. What did you do? Don't you know it's for our deceased son? Calm down! - Calm down! - What's with the teacher? The teacher is visiting us. But don't you know it's for my son? - Xin-ling! - Calm down! It's for my son! What's wrong with you? Xin-ling! I'm sorry, Mr. Wang. I'm sorry. It was my fault. If I slept in my bed that night, my brother would still be alive. It was all my fault. Let's rebuild a house of our own. Let's draw us a house, okay? Imagine it. What's the house that you want? Or imagine the house in your dream. - Are you done, Poker? - Yeah. Good. Your turn, Fatso. Xin-ling! Sit down once you're done. - I'm done. - Good. Will you stop following me? But Mr. Wang asked me to keep an eye on you. STUDENT RECORDS, YANG ZI-MO STUDENT RECORDS, JIAN DE-BIAO We can't change most of the things. But Mr. Wang... we're so glad that you've come back. Miss Pei-lun? I want to learn how to play Er-hu. Cherish these instruments. It was not easy to get them. You need to thank Mr. Wang for them. He's been working hard to help you. - Thank you, Mr. Wang. - Thank you. Get your own instrument. - Open the case and check. - Get your instruments! Tell me if you have problems. Who brought us these instruments, kids? Thank you, Mr. Wang. Thank you, Mr. Principal. There you are. How's your leg? Can't touch it? Here. Mr. Wang asked me to give it to you. Listen... Our school isn't like a school now. It's cool. Yen-tao doesn't tease me anymore. And Xin-ling is in a better mood. I don't have to walk her home. She's playing her brother's er-hu. And... And Mr. One Foot is super cool, like this. He's so good at playing a diabolo. I've got the drumsticks for you. They're yours. Poker wanted them too. We're reassembling the Chinese Orchestra. Are you coming back? Hey, come back. I feel so alone. Are you listening to me? Stop, stop... Listen to the other members, okay? It's teamwork. Let's start again. One, two, three. Go. Hey, you all. Listen to them. Our Chinese Orchestra is getting better. I'll deal with the heavy ones. Your club is doing well, Mr. Wang. Tell me if you need anything. I'll help you as much as I can. Thank you, sir. Don't mention it. Slow down. Listen to my claps. One, two, three. Go. - Miss Pei-lun. - Yes? Hey, kids! Kids! Stop, kids! We're competing nationally. Why? It should be Nantou Junior High. They're absent this year, so it's us. - Wow, great! - Yeah, great! - But we're not ready. - Really? Can we do it? - Yes, we can. - What? Are you scared? So we have to practice more. You're not happy? Yes, we are. It's a National Contest. - Are you scared? - No. Are you scared, Poker? Yes. You're lame! Are you scared, Fatso? Yes. So you'll have to practice more. You're not working hard enough. From now on, we'll keep an eye on Fatso. We'll compete nationally once he's ready. You hear? Yes! You keep coming. What a nuisance! You never came to practice. So I've brought them all here. - Hey, Bigwig! - Bigwig! Bigwig! Come back! - You traitor! - Come on! - Come back! - We need you. - Come on, smile! - Smile! Smile! Smile! - We need you. - Your instrument misses you. - Bigwig! - Come back! We can't do it without you. We're competing, you know? - Smile! - Come on! We need you. It'll never be perfect without you. You're so annoying! Come back, will you? We miss you. Come on! Promise me you'll come back. Wow, the review stand is huge! The classrooms are big! Super big! Let's go! Bring me the seedlings. Help me, Poker. - It's falling. Give me a hand. - Come on! Which one goes first? - The small one. - Okay. Give me a seedling. Help me with it. - Okay. - Water it? Yes, do it. Buy a horse in East Market, a saddle in West Market, a bridle in South Market, and what in North Market? A whip. Yes, a whip. Why did Mu-lan have to go to four different markets? Think about it. -Buy a horse in East Market, -What's the answer? -a saddle in West Market, -Do you know? A bridle in South Market, and a whip in North Market. Yeah, four different markets. No, it's a metaphor. It means that she went everywhere to get ready. Were you listening? - Do you understand it? - Yeah. Really? You're answering the question. Why me? It's always me. We get 40 points if you answer it, but 10 if I do it. What are the points for? For the prizes, of course. You study for yourself, not for the prizes. Concentrate, will you? I don't want to lose anyway. - But I haven't done it. - Mr. Wang! - What? - Yen-tao has a question. - What? - Do you know the answer? Fatso wants to know what the prizes are. I want an answer and you want the prizes? Come on. Two minutes left. I need you to tell me the answer. - Lots of places. - Places. My fellow teachers... The secondhand stuff we'll use as the prizes. Is it a good idea, Mr. Wang? We seem to be bribing the kids. No, you're wrong. We're using these to motivate them to study harder. Let's improve their schoolwork, so they'll learn more and gain more. 1 times 1 for ten thousand times is still one. But if we give it 0.1 more, 1.1 times 7 will be more than 2. Even if we give it 0.01 more, 1.01 times 70 will be more than 2. If we work a little harder and get to change one kid, it'll be worth it, right? I get what Mr. Wang means. Let's work on the 0.01 now. - It's fragrant because of... - My virtue. There's no... No illiteracy here. Is it correct? Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Wang. - Miss Pei-lun! - Be careful!

Wow, it's lively in there! Have you seen something you want? There's a pot. Really? Show me. Now, it's the auction time. What comes first? New sneakers. They're Bigwig's! - Yeah, they're mine! - They're Bigwig's! - The minimum bid, 750 points. - 800. - 800. Anyone? - 900. - 900. Any higher? - 950. 950. We have a 1,000. 1100! 1,100.

Mind your own business! It's Bigwig's size. What a coincidence! - New sneakers! - Show me! Look good on you. - With my points! - Yeah, mine too! When will you repay me? Study harder and get more. - It takes a long time. - Wait! Wait! You have to study hard to repay us. - Yeah, repay us. - Be quiet! Since we're friends, don't ask me to repay you. What the hell? Go study now! My 50 points! Study harder! - Repay my 200 points. - Whatever. Now we can cook Dad's favorite hot pot. Yeah. But how do we use it? What's a hot pot without meat? Get me the pot, Xin-ling. I'll wash it. I'm sorry. I've ignored you. Dad! I'm sorry. Forgive me. Dad! That is about what I can do. I can't do anything more. But it sounds good. We're competing nationally. I can teach er-hu, but as for other instruments... I think they need someone professional. Like this? Yeah, or there's no sound. What the hell? The bridge is gone. - I've never touched it. - Who else? Someone borrowed it. I don't know. - Who? - I don't know. - You've got it. - Yeah. Can you fix it? It'll do one way or another. You haven't fixed yours? No, but I used a pencil instead. All right. - Where's your drum? - It's broken. - Broken? - Yeah. Mr. Wang... I saw some students practicing in front of the temple the other day. I found their instruments broken. Some of them couldn't play properly. I guess you don't have enough money. So I've got in touch with some friends. They're masters of traditional Chinese Music. - How do you do? - I think they can help you. - Nice to meet you, Miss Jian. - Nice to meet you. They're traditional Chinese musicians. Thanks for coming. Get your arm closer. Your bow should be here, not here. Move your body with it. Yeah. Let's start... Six, seven... Half hole fingering... Three... two... Mom wants you to go home, Sis! But I haven't finished practicing. Well, I'm hungry. Dad wants you to make a delivery. Bro! Hurry up! Wait a second! No, Dad will be upset. The two of you, go home. But I need to practice more. Do it tomorrow. Don't make your dad worry. Come on, get your stuff. He said I can't practice anymore if I don't have time to mind our shop. We'll figure out something. He was just upset. Yeah, he said that because he was upset. Checkmate! Darn! Hey! What are you doing? - Just one game. - Don't worry. We'll try to convince your mom. - It'll be fine. - Don't worry. Hey! Hey! My dad wants me out of the club. Why? I'm making a delivery now. - What happened? - Where are you going? - Fatso! - Come back! - How do we rehearse without you? - I'm sorry! - Fatso! - Come back! What do we do? If we don't interrupt our routines at home, everything will be fine then? Good morning, Mr. Wang. Morning. Wow, you're early. We've solved the problems. Yeah. I don't make such early deliveries. Our grocery store hasn't opened yet. Ours either. - Have you had breakfast? - Not yet. - I'll buy some. - I want braised pork rice! Turnip cake! Cheese and egg sandwich! - Spaghetti! - Okay. What's xiao niao in English? Bird. Xiao niao. What are you talking about? Tell me. What's bing gan in English? Cookie, cookie. Harder, girls. I don't hear you. Louder. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Ready? Steady... Don't give up. Keep going. - Mr. Wang? - Huh? We want to talk to you about something. You have bellyache again? No. We want to take the vocation school entrance exams. But we're not sure if we can make it. What are you afraid of? Work harder. I'll be with you. NATIONAL STUDENTS' MUSIC CONTEST Get up, kids. Come here. Hey you! Come here. Are you nervous? Hey, the three of you! Come here! Come closer. They're good, Mr. Wang. Relax. We're not here to compete. We're here to show them that we represent Zhongliao Township and we're not defeated by the Earthquake. Okay? Yeah. Don't think about anything except for... that you're playing for the most important person in your mind. That's it. So when you're onstage, you'll do your best to play the best music that you can. - Okay? - Yeah. Come on. Fatso? Come here. When I count to three, whisper "Go for it". One, two, three. Go for it! SPIRIT SPIRIT Morning. Don't play here. Be careful. Hey! - Don't play balls here. - Yes, sir. - Go to class. - Yeah. Good morning. CLASS 1B We have to start anew like this every year. After the Earthquake, I stay and keep teaching the kids here. We know that education is the best way to make a change. Hopefully we'll pass on more positive energy in all corners of Taiwan. On December, 2016, our kids took part in the Music Contest again and won first place for the first time.
