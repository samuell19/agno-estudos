I'm just heading home. Okay. Have a good angel. Thank you. Have a good night. Get home safe. You too. Thank you. I'm sorry. We're closed. That's okay. You're the one we're here to see Joseph. Sorry. Do I know you? How do you, how do you know my name? But we both know that name tag is wrong. Don't we? Excuse me. My name is George. Nice to meet you, George and misunderstand. George is my real name. It's on my driver's license. My credit cards, my gym membership, normal name stuff. I don't understand what you want. I want your number. Seven eight dash nine three four Bravo. Correct. I am not going back there. We'd rather do this the easy way, but I haven't heard anyone. We both know that's not entirely true now, is it? You don't understand. They did this to me. Joseph, look at me, Joseph, this is your last chance. This is your last chance, Joe. I think I forgot my keys. Right. Overwatch to keep them on the roof. Overwatch, we'll take it from here. all of you. Let him go. We can talk. At walk, your man lives, huh? Fuck. Yeah. Shut up. Negative. Hold your fire. Are you doing Joseph deserve this? It's not my problem. try the cold chisel. That's going to mess up the threads. You're going to give yourself a heart attack, Danny. You're going to give me an aneurysm. If you don't mind your own business. God dammit. I'm getting this off. Got it. I guess I loosened it for you. I guess so. When you go clean up, I can finish. Sure. Marco what's going on. Sergeant shepherd, sir. Excellent. More today, your first Bravo class subject. Thank you, sir. It was a team effort. The modesty is not a good look on you. Sargent permission to speak freely. Sure. This subject took Scott hostage, our Intel from sites. It shows these subjects to be dangerous. Programmed killers, hostage, taking doesn't fit there at Mo what's your point, Sergeant? I don't think he wanted to kill this concert. Are we sure size data is telling us everything we need to know. Subjects will do anything to survive condition to kill, but also to deceive cutting basters. Good team assemble for debrief, sir. that guy's an asshole. Mark was harmless besides this is the only one who can get you, what you need. Look, I really appreciate you doing all this. Yeah, don't mention it. There's no way I can convince you to stay. Huh? I got family stuff. Have a good night. Sorry. I see it in high-risk for some cushy private sector security work. We are war and the war is secret. The front extends to our homes, but this unit is the last line of defense against a truly terrifying force. There's still dozens of echo and Delta class subjects on the loose. As many as 11 Charlie cervix remained on accounted for and at least four Bravos. What about the officer alpha class subjects do not exist. Siesta shut the project down before now if it was creative and if they hadn't, we'd be in serious trouble. Back to business a week, several subjects have been found dead. We believe that these subjects may have been hunted down by one of their own kind. Okay. So you're saying there's an enhanced serial killer out there who cares helping us out killing these things is not our job. Private Sergeant shepherd. What is our mission contain and incarcerated any and all enhanced subjects for the mutual protection of the public and themselves. Sure. Very good Sergeant. Now this bogey undermines our mission. Shall continue the operations for the time being, but keep your eyes open, be on the look out for anything out of the ordinary and do not engage. Is this clear? wouldn't kill you to say, please, please hurry. Daddy. Daddy. daddy. Daddy. What's your boss. Hey Mark. Perfect timing. She's already for you. I was like new. Thank you, Anna. You were going to take your lunch break. I think she should stay now. The kids gotta eat. I say she stays just for her right fast. Thank you. Wow, Anna just wants to go home. See your family. Home. She don't look Chinese to me. Listen. No, you listen. It's gonna attract the wrong kind of attention. This isn't bullshit. I wasn't talking to you. Little lady, we had a deal. You watch a fucking phone with me, the St. The school yard. Now you want the passport new deal, 10 lodge. Come on. You know, I don't got that kind of money. You don't get a passport. Very simple. Hold them down. Show me. Okay. I'm at seven 45 Olympic Boulevard. A man has been shot. His name is Danny, please. Sorry. Sorry. Yes, sir. Copy that. We have a zero point spike. The coordinates being sent at these levels, we'll have about two hours, sir. It's all the team to stood up, but you and I are tagging them too. leave the cab. And it's going after its own kind. Intel says it's happening. It's happening. Make a left I'll send up the drones. No need. She's like 90 pounds. Excuse me. Are you following me? No. I mean, we need to talk maybe a gym. Why should I talk to you so I can help keep you safe? I don't know what you think, you know, just take a look at this, watch it. right. All right. I get it. Talk later, leaving. sir, we have eyes on target female, about five, five brunette slim build photo center. whereas he services radio chatter has four men down in an auto shop. Suspect matches our target no IDs yet, but to be blunt force trauma fatalities and one deceased gunshot victim confirmed we'll tag. Correction, sir, target is mobile. We'll pursue have the unit converge on my signal. back off. You're too close. shit. Pull over, get eyes up. boost the signal. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Who the hell are you? You possess what belongs to me, dude. You better back off. seven one nine three two, Charlie. Come on with your hands above your head. No one else needs to get her tonight. I haven't done anything. Fuck that, man, back at your shop might disagree with you. Oh, that that's far enough. I didn't kill Danny on your knees with your ass behind your head. Johnson status? No readings yet, sir. holiday. More like an escape what's in China. He tried to help him. I swear, no subjects. Aren't exactly known to be the helping comment. Great. Let me go. No, I can't do that. God, he didn't deserve this and neither do I. Stick around. No, wait God too. Yeah, that. Okay. No, we're not. What'd you think we are? He's alive. Case, you're wondering you're him. Aren't you? You torch. So I say, and freed us, I guess I should say thank you for saving me. Altruism is inherently selfish. Okay. So do you have a name? No. Cromwell. We're shepherd. What the hell happened? Shepherd's Mia, Surrey froze during containment. Then he disappeared and the subject, I believe it's on foot, sir. Find it for God's sake as for shepherd, until we find a mirror and command deliveries delivery, sir. Who the hell are you? The subjects, your unit contained where they held barking up the wrong tree. It's a nice place. Your decorator have a number. I will not ask again. Look, Paul. I don't know what. Wait, if you do not know the location, then you're no use to me. You're going to kill him. Stop it. You can't just kill people. And you're no different than they are. I am. He hasn't till morning. usually it's water. Where are we? I don't know. So you're one of them. One of I don't work for . No, what? You're just following orders. I'm protecting people from their mistakes. Nobody needs protection from us. I've seen the files, they made us do it. Something about following orders. That's a good one. You have no idea what they did to us. There you go. No, but I know what you've done and what you're capable of doing. Try not to take it personally. Sir, we have a zero point reading related via satellite. It looks like it's coming from Shepherd's wrist sensor, but uh, wow. Right. Move out, putting the package. You can't trust him because he's a subject because he's worse. Okay. And what's that supposed to mean? Enhance them been turning up dead all across the country. One of your own taking it down from the inside. No, that's bullshit. I can protect them. You tried to kill me now. You want me to trust you? You trust him. What's on this, you know, Twitter, Instagram. So, what do I call you? Ana easier than seven one nine three two, Charlie. Yeah, one of the doctors that I say cult me, Anna. She uh, said, I looked like her daughter and she didn't like calling me a number. So she gave me a name. That's very kind of her. Yeah, it is. She was executed in front of me for treating a subject like a human. You filed, says you killed your doctor during a therapy session. Crushed your head like a grape, right after she asked you about killing your family. That's a lie. Why would they lie? So I say took me when I was four years old. I never saw my family again. They kept me prisoner. They did things to me and it was the same for all of us. If we didn't kill, we were punished reprogrammed. Yeah. There was no escape, no suicide. We had no choice. the location of the subjects. I'm sorry. You know, I can't really think straight before I have my morning coffee. You don't suppose you're amused and impatient. Finally something we can agree on. What do you want with the subject? I wish the freedom. Tell me the location. Sorry. I'm drawing a blank. It must be so frightening to be so fragile. So close to death at each moment. Just get it over with, you know, he's going to kill me. Right. And then he's going to kill you. no, he said he wants to free us. All of us. He wants to kill you. Why? I don't know, but I know he killed the others. You know that for a fact, call it a hunch. But one thing I know for sure is that he's going to kill my man right now. Just let me save them, just let me save them. And I'll forget you even exist. I'll even call off my team so you can escape. So I can spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. How many of us have you captured? Tell me, or I walk. About a dozen there's info on dozens, more still in the wild What's the reading only Charlie, sir. I'm tired. Telling me right now. Yeah. I'm fucking asshole. Okay. Hmm. Control unit. We all have them to help with programming. You believe me now I contained him three days ago. Does he look contained, supposed to be the program that incarcerated? Yeah. They lied to you. They did. What am I supposed to do about it? You can make a choice. you get in? I just want to help get in the car. To hold it, take it easy, Anna. You were right. I need to choose. Oh, he's one of them if I'm coming. So is he fine? Okay. You give me the watch. Come on the watch. Now watch this. What is this? We should be clear. We don't have the manpower to secure a perimeter. This large. I wasn't referring to them. I meant David David, more importantly. Who are you? Sorry, Eli black. Okay. Anna. Hey, just, yeah. It's George really bridge. So where are we heading? Look, there's a lot. You don't understand right now. Okay. It'll be easier to show you once. We're safe, safe from David, the charming fellow who put you two up at the cabin. If weren't for me, you'd both be dead right now. The subject hunting other subjects. Not exactly. Hold on. And why. Subjects want to kill their own kind. David's not a subject that he's the subject. Relax. It's a flat and you fix it. You have a spare room. Grabbing a few chocolate bars. Anyone need anything? What I'm hypoglycemic, you know, just forget it. Just wait until confusion sets in and you have trouble speaking. You trust that guy. I'm not exactly flush with options here am I? I'm a mechanic. Is your boss. Yeah. His name was Danny and he was trying to help me. And those guys took advantage of him. So you killed them. This what? I'm sorry, I'm just trying to understand. I get it. I'm dangerous. I'm a murderer. Look, I don't know what you are, but I'll admit you're not what I thought. And how do you know. Yeah, I can do all of these things, but what's the point of everything I touch turns to shit. A lot of people have died around me and because of me, I try to tell myself it's not my fault, but that's a lie, spent my whole life breaking things because I'm too weak to fix them. Look, we don't have to be best friends, but you have my word, not your enemy. see back in one piece. And brought you some visitors. He always worries. Is he a one, two, three, two, three, Charlie. It was one of my most wanted it's. Okay. So, okay. You won't hurt you? Uh, Lou Anna, Anna, Lou, Lou, George, George, Lou. What? So how'd you do end up here. I worked for Sasha. You're one of them. No, no. I was an analyst theoretical stuff. I didn't know what they were doing. It's okay. Go on. Uh, I was cataloging subatomic anomalies and subject DNA samples, and I thought I had discovered something remarkable. I didn't David destroyed the original facility and all my research was lost. I would have died there for one for live. Doesn't say much. Does he? No, not since the program is when I learned the truth, I felt horrible, but I continued to work on my own. okay. You are okay. Right. Soldier. Good. Cause we have a cluster fuck in our hands and I need you mission ready. So the good goddamn happened, actually, sir, I was hoping you could tell me that so SYSA, wasn't just manipulating subject DNA. It's simple. Let's just pretend to shoot at things for a living, everything in our universe, vibrates with the unique quantum signature. So they figured out how to move objects into a different space, with a different quantum signature and how to bring them back. Another dimension with no entropy, just limitless zero point energy. And so I say wanted to harvest it bingo, but yeah, don't get something for nothing. The energy was entangled with something alive, David. He's the body, they trapped it in, so it can exist in our universe, but the real David is something entirely different. So what is he an alien being of pure energy and not happy about being here. Right. So he's an alien. Sure. So what about me? DNA was infused with David's. So you have the same abilities. So what does David want to get home? But he has to be whole again, to make that happen. Meaning. Meaning he will absorb his energy from the subjects, all of them. Oh, that doesn't sound pleasant. We've been tracking missing subjects to warn them, but our intelligent, complete, what, what are you saying exactly? I'm saying we were tasked to contain a Charlie class subject, not a fucking alpha. There are no alphas. I saw Catherine something that's not in the files. Regions were off the charts. The tracks barely worked in the squad. What about the squad? Holy shit. You guys built a buffet for them. Where are they being held at a secure location, a few miles away. We can't let David get what he needed from this many subjects. Can't we just kill him. His body is human and it still bleeds, but he regenerates instantly. We need to weaken him. What about the tranq? It'll be like giving a park, a set to a charging rhino. You're going to need a lot, like, we might have a chance with this list. We can. Wait, we can, what, you know, team up, fight him. No, no, no, no. We need to keep the subjects as far away from David as possible. Let me and my team deal with this now that we know what we're up against, we can handle it. What about the squad killed them? it's about time. We get some goddamn Here. That's all I've got. Oh, and a blood sugar weight. Where will you go as far away as possible? David can't open the doorway until he's harvested every single subject he'll come for you. You're really going to do this. If they head back until my captain what's really going on. Hey, we could just run. You can. So that's it. That's it just keep moving and I'll try and stop him. What else is there? One the others. Or just disappear somewhere and live your life. Come on and take it. You've lost enough already. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, wait, I need the password. You have a belongs to me. Come on. Let's go. We can't just leave him there. You made a choice. Don't let it be for nothing. we don't have keys. Give me a second. We don't have a second. Yeah. Hey, wait, I can help you help me. The other subjects I can take it. There's a list of free subjects, addresses descriptions. You can find them, you go home, just let her go. We have a deal. Go ahead. What's the location to be picked up zero point ratings. Sorry, let me go. I will not let you down. I admire your spirit Crump mom, but he needs to sit this one out. sorry. Hey, sir. If you are doubting my capabilities, strike team can handle it. It, wait, wait, wait. You're issuing a kill order. It's not my call. Squat is out of play the two subjects that Aveda containment in one night, men upstairs decided to simplify things until we can work this all out, leave a skeleton crew and send the rest. Sir. What about shepherd, sir? Shepherd is no longer my concern. I don't understand shepherd aided and abetted the enemy until we have reason to believe. Otherwise he should be considered the threat. Yeah, a lot of pissed off people waiting for us. It's not too late to change your mind. You weapons do not. Well, they frightened me. I don't want to get caught in the crossfire concerns are irrelevant. We're almost there not walking away from this one. Am I. That frightens you. I'm not thrilled about it. And trippy defines your universe. There's no such thing in life and energy or eternal affection here. I'm forced to endure the state of decay, not an optimist. Then why pretend you have the power to stave off too inevitable? There's no safety, no control. We'll all die. Nothing will save you, not even an airbag. still at the car. Turn off the car heads up. Sergeant shepherd, the hell is going on here. You need to speak with captain Williams. You've been removed from active duty Sergeant. Um, did detain you until further notice. Listen to me when we have a threat inbound, I need to speak with Williams now. Sorry I have my orders. those won't be needed. It's good to see you in one piece, despite the circumstances, what the hell is going on here? There was a second subject in play captain, right? No, that doesn't explain why you broke protocol. Don't lecture me about protocol. Explain who sense? Seven, eight, nine, three, four. After us. What'd he talk about? Well, Joseph was on the war path. He attacked us at the cabin. The Fana hadn't saved me. You would have been with your squad. Okay. But they're dead now. And I had nothing to do with that. And you know, it, none of them did. They're not people they're weapons. God damn it. Bought and paid for it by our employers. And we use them as we see fit. They're in danger chillers and your friend, Anna murdered, dozens of innocence. She's in your head. You don't get it. God dammit. He's coming for them. And anyone standing in his way, who's coming. Just to fucking get, let them destroy it. We can come to us. You let him here. We can fight him together. Everyone's been deployed. What the fuck do we do? It's not over yet. You don't understand. Get out of my way. You can't serve these people up to them on a platter. This isn't your decision Sergeant. No, move your ass. This is what he wants. I won't ask you again. And I to fight these things, sir, just give me a chance. He really believed he could take this guy down by herself just to protect the innocence. These subjects, these people are innocent. They're a good soldier. I hired you because I knew he was the best. This time, we're going to do things my way. what the hell is he doing? You're only making them. Please. I say kept me a secret from you. What can you walk? Do I want you rid of this? Your universe is a decaying carcass. I can smell every particle and it nauseates me. I wish to leave it, but not before you thought you could lie to you. Fuck you. Now you could hurt me. You're not going to get anything from me. You piece of shit. If you waste away in your prison, you should know. She will suffer because of your choices. You'll try asshole. There's more of me too, than I thought I look forward to taking it back. I don't know, sir. you only exist to die. Oh, what have you done to me? I think compared to what I'm going to do to you now, pain you're feeling. I know because of you pain was all I knew. Wait, I must go home. The truck's not going to last much longer. Uh, Yeah. Be a while until you're a hundred percent. What about you? I've had worse. You look like shit. Hey, this is just temporary. What's your excuse? I don't have one busy getting my ass kicked. So what now? Oh, my God. How'd you find me? Hey. Yeah. I just called for a tow still. Not better. Don't count the years. Count the mileage. How about you? See you stuck with the name? I mean, don't, I look like an Ana. I don't know, maybe, uh, Lucy or Matilda. Wow. Wanda, Wanda. Wanda Honda. Okay. Don't name a baby. Okay. Noted. Well, look, I didn't just drag you out here to change the tire information on the others addresses relatives. Just you want to find them? My parents. Long gone. I didn't mean them. Yeah. There's my do a, with some of my cue to guide them. Yeah. Not so sure about that. Just the thought. Thank you. Hey, where are you going? You know, I've actually got a flat tire, you know, you're good at fixing things. Same time as always, babe. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Donnie's here. I'll call you tonight, babe. Jim rivers. Yeah. Can I help you? Yes. You have something that I need.
