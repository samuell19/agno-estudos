[interviewer 1 in French] [in French] [Tony in English] If you're going to become an international brand, you have to have a name people can pronounce.

Pierre Cardin. -Cardin. -Cardin. -Cardin. -Cardin. Cardin... [stammers] Pierre Car-- Oh, you should just say it. -[chuckling] -Just say it, I'll drink. That'd be Pierre Cardin. You know, Pierre Cardin. There's no one on the planet who's not going to recognize that name. That's an exaggeration, but it's not far from the truth. Pierre Cardin.

And he's not. He's Italian. [both in French] [in Italian] [Daniele in Italian] [Rodrigo in Italian] [in Italian] [in French] [newsreel narrator] Mussolini's road to power began in 1922 when his fascist Blackshirts marched on Rome.

So Bérard knew Cocteau, Cocteau knew Christian Dior, and so on. [Pierre in French] [chuckles] [interviewer 4 in French] [laughing] [both in French] [chuckles] [all laughing] [Claude in French] [Pierre in French] [Claude in French] [both in French] [Jean-Pascal in French] [in French] [Naomi in English] At the end of the day, the real designers are the ones that know how to tailor. They can never be starving. You can tailor, you can eat. [Amy in English] Immediately after World War II, he is connected to all these social events that are legends. He dressed Christian Dior as a lion. Cardin made that costume. This is 1948. And then at the Beistegui Ball, one of the great costume balls of the century, he contributed through the costumes. [newsreel narrator] On the Regio Canal, Venice, the Labia Palace is transformed for one night into a scene of 18th century glory.

[calm music] [designer 4 in French] [in French] [lively music] [newsreel narrator in English] Here's the latest look from Paris, filmed in Paris. [Maryse in French] [John in French] [Philippe in French] [young Pierre in French] [Maryse in French] [interviewer 5 in French] [in French] [young Pierre in French] [in French] [young Pierre in French] [in French] [Renée in French] [young Pierre in French] [in French] [in French] [Pierre in French] [in French] [interviewer 6 in French] [young Pierre in French] [interviewer 7 in French] [Laurence in French] [in French] [Pierre in French] [Maryse in French] -[interviewer 5 in French] -[young Pierre in French] [interviewer 5 in French] [in French] [lively music] [woman 2 in French] [woman 2 and Pierre speaking French] [Pierre in French] [Siti in French] [young Pierre in English] [Tony] He really brought that to the fore during the '50s and '60s where we were changing our idea as to what could be in a fashion magazine. Even from the very beginning, he didn't go for the conventional set of mannequins at that time. If he felt that they were right to show his creations and express his creativity and his designs, and he chose in the right frame of mind. [interviewer 8 in French] [in French] [interviewer 8 in French] [Hiroko in French] [in Japanese] [Pierre in French] [Tony in English] It was a perfect marriage of model and designer. Once she was established, we knew that she was the one that would be wearing the main pieces of the season because she did have a real knack for wearing Cardin that none of them quite had. [lively music] [Dionne] The diversity was quite refreshing. Because during the '60s, here in the States, we were experiencing some true ugliness. I... didn't like what my country was doing to people that look like me. I still don't. [Dionne] In the '60s, he decided that it was okay to use a Japanese person. It's okay to use a person that looked like me with brown skin. What he was selling was not a color of skin. [Jenny in English] It's very important that Hiroko was a model in the '50s because it changes your perception of a Japanese woman or what beauty can be. I was a Japanese, tattooed lesbian I didn't want to ever model. But what made me do it was because there's nobody that represented anything like that. And I thought, &quot;You know what, if there's a window of opportunity...&quot; Politically, it had to be done with fashion. I mean, you can reach billions of people with a cover of a magazine. [Naomi] He was extremely instrumental in being one of the designers to use models of diversity and go color. So, for that, I thank him. The 1960s is this key decade in fashion where we start to see this idea of &quot;Pre-war hierarchies of society should be broken down.&quot; [Amber] What's being called the &quot;youthquake&quot; was a really big part of this. Breaking from the past, not wanting to wear what your parents wore. [in French] [Renée in French] [Claude in French] [in French] [Claude in French] [Trina in English] His clothing definitely moved away from having anything to do with the actual shape of the female form. So, of course, if you're wearing an A-line dress, it's much easier to move around than it is if you're wearing, you know, a very tight-fitted dress. So in a sense, I think that being able to move freely is empowering! It was not only women and women and freedom but here is a colorful exclamation point at the end of a sentence. [thrilling music] I see Pierre Cardin as somebody who was a feminist, who understood, also, what women from the '60s and '70s needed in a designer. [Alexandra] So, Pierre Cardin was one of the first to really create beautiful silhouettes, beautiful clothes that were reasonably priced and were made of materials that were practical, that you could wash and wear or dry clean. It's just... it's just beautiful. -If I stand up, will you see it? -[interviewer 9] Yeah. Okay, because it really is, it really is kind of amazing. With Cardin, men's wear changed so dramatically. [Tony] Because men's wear was so based around that men wore suits. So once we started to relax, a lot of people wanted Cardin, because it was modern, and it was young, and it was different [TV announcer] Paul, John, George, and Ringo. [interviewer 10] [John] We got it from Pierre Cardin. -[interviewer 10] From whom? -[all] Pierre Cardin. When you're looking at a magazine, you go through the Dior, the Balmain, the Nina Ricci and then you get to Cardin, and you go, &quot;Wow! I've turned the page and I've gone from sexy women with a rolled umbrella and a little hat, and suddenly, I've got a girl with a geometric Vidal Sassoon haircut and this amazing look, and it's modern.&quot; It says modern. [Kennedy] No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come. Man and his quest for knowledge and progress is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead. [thrilling music] [young Pierre in French] [in French] [Jean-Paul in French] [Pierre in French] [Pierre in French] [Renée in French] [in French] [Amy in English] Well, the circle is a perfect form. A circle is also a sphere, which is a globe, which is a universe that he occupies. I mean, he covers the globe. He always has thought globally. It also was a symbol of eternity, and Pierre Cardin seems to be forever. [Jean-Michel in French] [Pierre in French] [dramatic music] [young Pierre in French] [Amy in English] He was just a futurist. He was a futurist in the way the designs looked, he was a futurist in his idea of how fashion can be a business, he was a futurist in his, sort of, all-encompassing, all-embracing idea of art and performance art and architecture and fashion of being of one piece. [young Pierre in French] [Rodrigo in French] [young Pierre in French] [John in French] [Christopher in English] There's always something extra. It's true for his furniture, and it's true for his clothes. And I think that's what makes him so appealing. There's always a cherry on top. [in French] [Philippe in French] [snips] [Florent in French] [calm music] [Pierre in French] [indistinct dialogue] [in French] [Pierre in French] [all in French] -[woman 3 in French] -[Pierre in French] [woman 3 in French] -[woman 4 in French] -[Pierre speaking French] [Pierre in French] [lively music] [Pierre in French] [man 7 laughs] [in French] [laughter and applause] [speaking French] [both in French] [Rodrigo in French] [in Italian] [Rodrigo in Italian] [Rodrigo in French] [in French] [piano playing] [Rodrigo in French] [in French] [both in French] [upbeat music] [Mark in English] Pierre Cardin was one of the pioneers in making eyewear fashionable. Both sunglasses and prescription. Prior to Pierre Cardin, the choices in eyewear were gold rim, tortoise, black, and a combo frame like what Kevin Costner wore in JFK. All through the '70s and '80s, it was Pierre Cardin that propelled the eyewear industry into designer. [ James Bond theme music] [Amy] He certainly put power in the logo. [Christopher] The Helvetica. The anthromorphic, bimorphic PC. [Amy] He is not the first one to put the logo on the outside, but he's one of the first to know that he didn't have to do it discreetly. Branding is really a perfect way of telling people, &quot;I am aligning myself with the, you know, aesthetic principles of this particular designer, but I understand good taste.&quot; [man 8] Clear the runway. [in Japanese] [in Japanese] [Yoshio in Japanese] [in Japanese] [Yori in Japanese] [in English] If the identification-- There's a brand identification. I mean, you could say the same thing happens with beer or cigarettes. [young Pierre in French] [upbeat music] [in French] [Michael in English] What's been described as licensing, we now fully recognize as branding. I think the first time I heard about Pierre Cardin, was because someone I was dating was wearing the cologne. [Pierre in French] [Alice in English] It's just like clothes. What's the new fragrance? The Pierre Cardin. If you didn't have that, you weren't cool. [Sharon] The bottle was fantastic. It was so chic. Architecturally just extraordinary. [Christopher] Part of what makes it so provocative and fun, obviously, references a penis. That's sex. [in French] [upbeat music] [Christopher in English] Even this sort of inexpensive towels have a graphic image that evokes Pierre Cardin. Wait, he did an AMC Javelin? [TV advertiser] With elegant and colorful upholstery, classy door panels, and chic headliner. The Cardin Javelin was really fully realized. It, it was pretty awesome. [Bob] The Cardin option really gave them a piece of distinction that no other manufacturer had. Not content to being earth-bound, he lent his brand and his ethos to a plane. An executive jet by West Wind. [Pierre in French] [Philippe in French] [in French] [in English] It seems to me that it would've been an impossible task to keep track of it all. And, so at some point, there's some licensee somewhere in the world, going rogue and just creating whatever they want and putting a Pierre Cardin label on it. [in French] [young Pierre in French] [Pierre in French] [in French] [in English] From the very beginning, he never accepted any money. He never took a loan from a bank. He's that clever as a businessperson. [Matthew] Dior, the Houses of Dior, and the other Houses, they have been developed. But they've been developed by marketing teams and by marriages and alliances with other big corporations. Pierre Cardin belongs to Pierre Cardin. [young Pierre in French] [Amy in English] Pierre Cardin on the cover of Time Magazine is proof of the fact that he was well-regarded, not just as a designer of frivolities for women, but also as a empire-builder. [grandiose music] [in French] [in English] Welcome to Maxim, my friend! [in French] [calm music] [in French] [Tony in English] Of all the things he would buy, in Paris, he would buy the oldest Art Nouveau Restaurant. [in French] [in French] [in English] Please. [tranquil music] [in French] [Pierre-André in French] [in French] [both in French] [in French] [Pierre in French] [in English] With Cardin, in spite of all the modernity, in spite of all the synthetics, in spite of all the shine, it doesn't have a coldness to it. And that, I think, maybe that there's still that little bit of the Italian warmth sitting somewhere inside his genetic make-up. Maybe it's also the fact that he has a certain warmth as a person which we may or may not always see in his public persona. He's creating for tomorrow, but not as a challenge to frighten or scare us. He's designing for tomorrow because that's where he's looking. [in French] [Amy in English] That already introduced that idea of fantasy. And big part of his fantasy is, like, what is a world of the future. The world of the future he saw as something global. [Amy] He was in Japan when you hardly saw Japanese in western clothing. He was in China when everyone was still in a Mao uniform. He was in the Soviet Union when there was no fashion at all. I mean, whoever thought of these places as markets? Countries that didn't have even the freedom to wear the clothes that they wanted to wear.

His name is Pierre Cardin.

So apparently Burt let her know, &quot;Big girl's coming over.&quot; She did my sound check, she did my lighting. Then proceeded to walk into my dressing room to look at the clothing that we're to wear. She took, hanger and all, threw them in the hall. She was throwing my clothes out. I thought the lady lost her mind, okay? I didn't know her, she didn't know me. As she's throwing them out, I'm picking them up. And she says, &quot;Oh, no, no, no. You do not wear this.&quot; [Dionne] &quot;You must wear only couture.&quot; That's why Pierre Cardin's on the cover of Make Way for Dionne Warwick. He was at, I think, every performance I did. ♪ What do you get When you fall in love? ♪ ♪ A guy with a pin To burst your bubble ♪ ♪ That's what you get For all... ♪ [indistinct chatter] [Alice in English] We get to the Pierre Cardin 30 and it's just beautiful.

We're used to playing in dungeons.&quot; [in French] [rock music] [Alice in English] '71 was the year that we had pretty much terrified everybody in rock and roll. So, there we are, getting ready to do our show, and they come running in and they say, &quot;They're rioting outside. They took Omar Sharif's Rolls-Royce and ran it through the glass window.&quot; They put Neo, my drummer, and myself in a closet, a broom closet, with Bianca Jagger and Catherine Deneuve. We're like this. And I went, &quot;I love riots and Paris.&quot; [laughs] [Alice] Well, you think back on it now, 20/20 hindsight, the idea of bringing Alice Cooper into a theater like that, I think he probably knew there was going to be a riot. And that didn't bother him one bit.

And I remember him saying to me, &quot;Your beauty is like a white rose.&quot; And I was so shy, but it was such a big deal that he noticed me, I felt. And that he said this very particular thing to me. Started to make me think that women all have a particular kind of beauty. And that we're all like flowers. And that we're all different kinds of flowers. It's something that stayed with me, really stayed with me, and really meant a lot to me. [in French] [in French] [upbeat music] [in French] [Pierre in French] [interviewer 5 in French] [in French] [interviewer 5 in French] [in French] [Pierre in French] [in English] Watching Jeanne Moreau walk through a parking lot? [Sharon] Is... akin to watching any other actress do a three-page monologue. [Josée in French] [Pierre in French] [Josée in French] [in French] [Amy in English] I guess a lot of people doubted there was something there, because they're more accustomed to the idea of Pierre Cardin with a man than a woman. But, my God, if you're going to make an exception, then why not Miss Jeanne Moreau? [interviewer 13 in French] [young Pierre in French] [Josée in French] [in French] [Pierre in French] [young Pierre in French] [Jeanne in French] [Tony in English] We're so used, now, knowing everyone's private lives. It's difficult to understand that years ago, people didn't feel it was necessary for it to be part of their discussion with a journalist or an interview or the motivation for their seasonal collection. And I think it's interesting that with some designers, you don't really know an awful lot about their private lives. [Tony] With Cardin, he didn't need to have a banner headline saying, &quot;Here he is.&quot; [young Pierre in English] [in French] [in French] [Jean-Paul in French] [in French] [in English] [rock music] [in English] [rock music] [in English] [rock music] ♪ My heart flutters When my sunshine fades away ♪ ♪ What kind of colors could I Bleed to make you stay ♪ [Christopher in English] Of course, in 1961, Pierre Cardin takes up with Jeanne Moreau.

[in French] [in French] [Amy in English] The relationship between Andre and Pierre Cardin survived this incident and, hey, if I were Andre, I would rather have infidelity with a woman than with a man. [in English] But, in the sort of history, one gets the sense of him as this sort of rock. He's introduced at the end of the runway shows which is kind of a remarkable thing, right? You don't see Alexander McQueen introduce somebody else. [Jean-Paul in French] [Jean-Michel in French] [Christopher in English] Andre Oliver dies in 1993 from AIDS.
