What you've been through, so much loss... - Totally. - So much heartache Mm-hmm. So much agony. Agony too, sure. And yet here you are, sitting before me. You look great, by the way. Bonnie, stop. Thank you. What do you say to those people who see you sitting before me and say to themselves... "He doesn't look all that innocent?" What do you say to those people, George? George? George? Can you see it? Isn't it gorgeous? Welcome to this year's Black and White Gala. I'm Tawny Talban and as always, I'm your host. The stars are out tonight. Sheikhs, princesses, movie stars together for one night of glitz and glam. - Look how stunning they all are... - George! - One more beautiful than the last... - - George! George! What are you doing? Nothing. I need a guy to come on my face. Okay. And I don't want a challenge. I don't want somebody who's gonna, like, look down on me. I just need a dumb whore guy to just fuck me stupid. Get dressed. We're going dumpster diving for dick. Playing hard to get won't ever work for you Oh, my God. I... I can't. - This place is gross. - Yeah. All right, I'm gonna take a piss or drown myself in the toilet. Take your time. - Hi, hi, hi. - Hi. So... Oof. Sorry, bro. Uh, you waiting for the bathroom? Uh, no. I mean yes. Okay. Well, after you. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Well, that's a mighty fine pair of legs you got there, ma'am. Oh, I don't know what you just said. I don't know what that was. Take it easy, man. 'Kay. He's hot. He's hot. You're kinda hot too. You're gonna go... you're gonna go out there and you're just gonna talk to him. Oh, yeah. - My God. - What's so funny? Georgie, this is Joe. Joe, this is George. Yeah, I just saw this guy's dick. You were looking? I... I didn't... I didn't look. Wasn't lookin, but... Your name was... was it Box? - Lux, but so close though. - Oh, short for luxury? No, my dad wasn't a rapper, so it's just Lux. Huh. You know, I didn't expect to meet two beautiful people like yourselves at a place like this today, I gotta tell you. Oh, well, we just were so sick of, like, the scene, so we wanted to mix it up a little, you know? Oh, come on. You two could go anywhere. Yeah, well, we can. We're just... we love the... the scene, but we don't want it right now. Mm-hmm. We're just trying to do it more organic. - All natural and... - Mm-hmm. - Mm. - Down... home. Down... stream. - Oh, totally. - Yeah. - Totally. - Another round, on me? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yes. It's a cider. He seems... - I want to eat him. - Mm, yeah. Isn't... isn't it nice? Aren't you jealous? Oh, it's just the best house! This... this is the foyer. Oh, these are the best books. Fuck! The best... the best part is outside. - Let's go look. - Okay. Let's go skinny dipping. Oh, oh, oh! That's good! That is good! Oh. Morning, stud. - Um, you don't have to do that. - Oh, no worries. I'm happy to help. Dude, this place is fucking awesome. Are you renovating or... Remodeling, yes. It's gonna be great when it's done. I bet. - Sleep okay? - Like a fucking rock. I... I'm sorry. I need a spoon. What are you gonna do for it? I'm fucking with you. I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing. You know, I like you. You're not like other gay guys. Oh. Thank you. You're a take-charge kind of a guy. - Are you talking about me? - Yeah. Must be fun and easy, right? I mean, two dicks. They either like each other or they don't. And you, you must be getting all the guys. Well, actually, I don't... I don't date a lot. Oh. How come? I got a... too big a cock. Holy shit. - You like that? - That was funny. Yeah. Straight guys love jokes about big dicks. But seriously, you don't go out a lot? I mean, you look like the type that needs a tux every weekend. Um, well, I... I, uh, haven't worn one in a while, but I hope to soon enough. Hiiiiiiiiii. Gosh. You guys must be the hottest pair on the club circuit, huh? Brother and sister, I'm assuming? Um, I'm his mother. - Wicked stepmother. - No fucking way. Way. I'm married to his dad. - And you don't mind that we're... - Oh, no, have at it. Uh, my dad cheats on all his wives, and the wives can do the same. Uh-huh. Have you heard from him, by the way? No. You? - Uh-uh. - You guys aren't close, I take it. Oh, would you get close to a shark, a narcissist, a misanthrope... Lux. To answer your question, no, we are not close, and that's fine. - Oh, so this is his place. - It's one of his properties. We're just, like... you know, we're just crashing here for the summer. Free rent? You guys get to live like kings and you don't need to work? - That's, like, the dream, right? - Mm-hmm. I wouldn't say that exactly. - He doesn't pay for everything? - Oh, we wish. We wish he would pay for... - Lux. - Mm-hmm? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. It's just everyone knows that we can't get his money, and we've been shunned for it because word travels really fast. - Lux, I said shut up. - Georgie, he doesn't care. - I do. Sorry. - God, just say it. No. - Say it. - I said no. He pays for nothing and we are destitute. Say it. All right, fine! He pays for nothing and he makes us grovel for pennies and I hate him. - What else, bitch? - I got a hemorrhoid last week 'cause I was so stressed out about it, and I haven't been able to sit right in days! - And? - I want him dead! I want him dead, yes! I had to re-wear an outfit from and sell all my fur coats on the internet. Why can't he just die? I want to stab him in his fat fucking gut! God, I want to spit on his corpse and take a shit on it! - I hate him! - I want to take a shit on it so bad! You want me to kill him for you? Oh, my God. - That is so sweet. - Wait, what? Yeah, I mean, it's easy with an old guy. You've done it before? - Oh, yeah. - "Oh, yeah"? You know, I think I'd rather kill him personally. I can make that happen, too. You know, I can facilitate things for you both. Oh, fun. Like a group thing? - Yeah. - Lux! We're horrible, but we're not murderers. Speak for yourself. All right, that's it. No more murder talk. We're having such a nice day. Shit. - Okay, but if we killed him... - Right. Guys, what did I say? No more murder talk. Why are you protecting him? Because he's my dad. And, like, I don't know, a person in the world. - People die every day, man. - Mm. Mm-hmm. Who are you? All right, just think about for a second, all right? If you could do it, if you could kill him, if you could get away with it, wouldn't you? - We'll cut you in once the job is done. - How much? Million. Okay. Sorry, I'm... I'm having a panic attack. - Wine is good though. - How many people have you killed? And it doesn't count if you were in a war or something. I don't mean Iraqis. I mean real people. - 18. - You've killed 18 people? Uh, I don't think he stuttered, Georgie. Fine. So you're not just a killer. You're, what, an assassin? Whoa. Assassin's a loaded word, you know? A little too political. I'm a... I'm a hit man. A hit man? Cool, chill. And, uh, how do people procure these services? The dark web. - The dark web? - The dark web? Oh, we are so lucky to have found you. Well, everybody's got someone they want to kill. Thing is no one realizes how easy it is to do it. I can't believe this. This is like a website but for horrible things. Oh, they accept Bitcoin. I want him to think that he's about to get laid... - Mm! - And then right before, bam, dead. Yeah. Bam like a gun? No guns. They're traceable. - The bullets too. - Ooh. Well, then what are we gonna do, kill him by hand? There's lots of options. You know, doing it here would be ideal. Stage it like a home invasion. I'd have to tie you both up after. He just came home at the wrong time. And then all that money, all that fucking money, it's ours. - How soon can you get him here? - A couple days. But you know what? You should probably stay the night, I feel. - Yeah? - Mm. - Yeah, I love to fuck before a murder. - Mm-kay, good. - So fucking nice. - All right, okay, I'm gonna see what's streaming or something. I'll dive into a new show. - Mm-hmm. Okay. - Yup. Bye, Georgie. Oh, oh, oh! Yeah, that's good, that's good. that's good, that's good! Yes! Oh, my God! Wipe your eyes. Promise me you'll never lie to me the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies? Usually it's because they want something. They're afraid the truth won't get it for them. Do you tell lies? So I've thought about it, and I've thought about it long and good. And we can't do this. I can't do this... we can't do this. Sweetie, do you need a pill? Just grab my purse. How are you so okay with this? I mean, I know my dad's a bad guy, but doesn't killing him make us just as bad as he is? I mean, doesn't that mean he wins, in a way? How does it make you feel to be just stuck in this house with no expense account, no perks, while he just flies around on that PJ? - Not good. - And why is that? Because he thinks it's what we deserve. Your father drove us to this. So we kill him? With that guy? I mean, who even is that guy? Okay, well, what I know is that he wants to do this for us and he can make me come in, like, three minutes flat. So I don't know what else there is to talk about. What about the police? What are we? Hmm? We're white. And? And we're rich. Right. We're white and we're rich. We can kill one guy. Speaking of, I gotta call him and find out when he's coming back. He's probably knee-deep in Ukrainian hooker pussy right now, but Mama still knows what to say to get him hard. So just be a man about it, okay? Hi. Hi, Daddy. When are you coming back? 'Cause I miss you. - Hey. - Oh. Why aren't you ready? I can't figure out what to wear. I've never had to pick out an outfit for whatever we're about to do. All right, well, all black works usually. That's one hell of a closet you got here. What's this? Is this a... Oh... oh... I'm sorry. Please... Tap out. Sorry, sorry. That... uh, that's just my tux and I just don't like it when people touch it. Okay. Is it made out of solid gold or something? No, it's... it's custom. - It's custom? - Yeah. It's fit just for my body, and... It's the only thing in this house that is just for me. Okay, well, hurry up. We gotta go. Pick something out in black, okay? Black. - Darling, welcome. - Where is my son? Oh, like you care. Place looks like shit. Duh. - Come upstairs. - Why? - Fuck me. - Hmm. Good girl. Make yourself a drink and come up. Lux, have you and/or George been in my office? Mm. Ahh. Mm, mm, mm, mm. - Where? - Where what? Where do you want to get fucked, little girl? Mm... - I want it here. - You whore. Bingo. You've got this, bro. It's time to man the fuck up, all right? Come on. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Okay, when you're ready. Yeah. Oh, fuck. It's the driver! Okay, okay, okay. Let me lead the way. Give me a list. Who wants it? - Mm, come join me on the bed first. - Mm-mm. Give me a list. Okay. - British or American? - Start with the Brits. Dudley Moore... John Cleese... Alan... dead-ass Rickman. Mm. All those British fucks, they wanna fuck me. Keep going. - You hear that? - Mm-mm. I don't... mm-mm, mm-mm. Oh, what about Parliament? Nigel Farage? Shh, shh! David Cameron... - Theresa May. - Theresa May? Mm. That's interesting. I'd scissor her. I'd scissor 'em all. - Even the guys. - Okay, that's enough. Get ready. Back it up for me. Hurry it up. Hurry it up, people. - Mm. - Anytime you're ready. Anytime you want to just slam it on in. Anytime you're ready! Slam it in! - You bitch! - Oh, they could be here for me. Stop right there! Get the fuck out of my way. Would you just... Get this motherfucker! Stab the motherfucker! Stab him! Stop! George? N... no. Take off that goddamn mask. George, you pussy. You little fucking pussy. You spoiled, little pussy. Look at you. Come here. What do you think you're gonna do, huh? You and Lux are gonna rot in this house. You are parasites. - Stop. - You are rotten. In fact, you are nothing. You are gum stuck to my shoe. Ha. You don't have the guts. Oh! I think he's dead. - Of course it's you. - Mm, that's right, hubby. And I hate to break it to you, but... I don't think it's gonna work out between us. And it's not because you're old or manipulative or an asshole. I would have made any of those work. It's 'cause you're cheap. Your turn, Georgie. Do it. Fuck you! Huh. I really thought his head would roll off. Mr. Viscunini? Can I get you anything to drink? Water, tea, seltzer, coffee, a smoothie infusion? Uh, no, nothing, thank you. Something to eat? What about a bagel? Still no. Thanks. Are you sure? Nothing? Bottle of water, hot water with lemon, pad thai? I'm really... I'm really okay. I'm not gonna be here that long. But thank you. Today is the best day of my frickin' life! Do you ever just shut the fuck up and play it cool? No, no. They're lawyers, so, wah, wah, wah. Mr. and Mrs. Viscunini, right this way. It's actually in here. - It's so dark. - I don't... I was your father's personal attorney. I knew him for many, many years. And I'm also now the trustee who's been assigned to handle his will. And there's a lot to sort through, so... Because there's so much money? "My estate will be delivered as follows. "The Brentwood property will be bequeathed to my wife and son, while all other possessions shall go to my daughter." - Uh, uh... daughter? - Daughter? What are you, trans now? The house isn't even worth that much and we don't have the money to take care of it. And what daughter? Well, we're working on figuring that out. And whomst are you? This is my firm's investigator, Peter Ellison. He will find her. And when he does, he will bring her here and we will execute your father's last wishes. Mr. Ellison knows that she's originally from Ventura, or, well, at least we think she is. Are there any more bastard dumpster babies we need to be worrying about here? And how do you even know it's his kid, huh? - Where's the blood test? - Mm. - Who's the mother? - Mm. - The mother is dead. - Of course. She died of a heroin overdose. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Oh, tacky. I cannot believe this shit. The money should only go to the real family. You don't count. You were his mistress first, remember? Sucking his cock on my mother's deathbed. Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. Was not her deathbed. She was in a coma. And you know what? Go fuck yourself, Georgie, 'cause he hated you, clearly. Please, if you will continue looking through your papers? I can't read this. I don't read lawyer. Legalese, legalese. What are we supposed to do? $10,000 a month? That is literally nothing. He's treating us worse now than when he was alive. - What are we supposed to do, get jobs? - Ugh. Okay, okay, you know what? Okay, we... we're gonna meet back at the house. You take the Maserati, I'll take the Porsche. We have gotta get ahold of Joe. I guess we're not gonna have personalized chauffeurs anytime soon. Don't ever say shit like that to me again. Fuck! What's the story now? I'm not supposed to see you guys again. And we weren't supposed to kill anyone else either, so... - He did this just to fuck us. - Okay, okay, we gotta find her. We gotta kill her, 'cause that way we get twice as much. - That math isn't right. - Whatever. We get more. Some bastard child in the Valley gets everything and we get nothing? All that neglect for nothing? - Kill who? - Uh, his sister. Until then we only get 10 grand a month. Everything's still within reach. It's just a little further away than we thought. How do we find her? Oh! Thank you so much for coming. Oh, I'm so happy to be here. It's... it's beautiful. It's perfect, just like you guys. Oh, my God, I love your top. Is... is that a bikini or... - It's a child's Halloween costume. - So hot right now. Thanks, babe. I love your top. Thanks. It was my mom's. Aww, when did she die? She's not dead. Oh. - So babe, we think you're great. - Really, really great. So great. And we need your help. You guys need the other heir for your dad's money, huh? - Yes. How... could you know that? - What else could you want? Do you guys need her bank records, address? I hacked into their files and got all of the info on your sister and I made copies. Why are you doing all this? Seriously, why help us? I've seen so many people come in and out of that office. I see what a big fat check can do to someone. For them. Watching their expression change from when they first arrive to when they leave, they are so truly, genuinely happy, and money is the cause. To have to not worry about basic needs like food, rent, student debt? You. That's what I want. To be able to hold my head high knowing that everything is gonna be okay. I want $2 million wired via routing instructions I'll provide when the funds are secure. They're meeting her tomorrow morning, so you don't have a lot of time. Done. - You two really deserve that money. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. We really do. - Her name is Caitlin. - Caitlin? Yeah. Caitlin Cox. Is it spelled the rich way with a K and a Y? No. The poor way with a C and two Is. Gross. Yeah, and it looks like she lives just over the canyon. Okay, we go get her. We bring her back here. Georgie, go with him 'cause Mommy's tired. That's fine with me. Let's go. - Wait, why do you need my help? - In case something goes wrong. - I will be the something wrong. - You know what? It's true, 'cause Joe, you're all, you know, muscle and power and Georgie here is basically a paper doll. Hey, I work out, okay? In a... in a place with weights? That's rich coming from you, the cigarette and Diet Coke vegan. The weak... that was a weak burn. All right, you two. Bring Mommy back another corpse. All my secrets and my demons tried to trap me But I leapt aside when the devil tried to grab me. How could he slip from the grip of the charm Oh, man he had me so now it's murder, it's murder Murder in the Valley In the Valley In the Valley In the Valley Murder in the Valley Valley, Valley In the Valley in the Valley, in the Valley Murder in the Valley, murder in the Valley, Murder in the Valley What? I don't think I'm cut out for this. I just killed my dad and now I have to kill this girl? My sister who I've never even met? You've only killed one guy. It takes practice, man. Believe me, you're a natural. - You think so? - Look, you want the money, right? Yeah, I want the money. I... I don't just want the money though. I... I can't even say it. Spare me the bullshit. I want to go to a party. - A party? - Yeah. Not just any party. It's called the Black and White Gala... And it's bigger than any party you've ever been to. Everyone there is either rich or famous or both. Sheikhs and princesses and movie stars. And you can't buy a ticket. You have to be invited. And being invited means validation. And I'd kill anyone for that. All right, look, this is how it's going down. - We'll wait for her to get settled in. - Got it. In the file it said she has another job working from home. Which is? She's a cam girl. All right, so when she's getting ready, we sneak around the back and we cut the internet. Then we gag her and we tie her up. - Wait, we don't kill her there? - No way. Too much evidence to spread. Once we get her in the bag, we get her in the truck. Once I get her in the truck, I do the technique. - The technique? - Yeah. See, I take the knife, I stick it in, then I take the other hand, press it past her ribs. - The technique. - The technique. Works every time. You ready? - Yeah. - Okay. Let's get the fuck out of here. Here we go. Let's give them a show tonight. Oh, yeah. Mm. Oh, fucking internet. What the fuck? Let's get this money Fuck you! Kill her! Come on! - Let's get this money - Do it... kill her! Not the face! Get get get get Let's get this money Good shit. Fuck. Hoo. Are you gonna kill me too? No. Okay. So what do you do this for? I mean, you don't just do it for the money, right? - What is this, the "third degree"? - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. No, I don't do it for the money and the parties, if that's what you're asking. I don't need much of anything, really. This line of work, you got to, uh, keep a low pro. You're a ghost. Is your name even Joe? Those too. - Pants. - Right. You know I usually do this shit alone, right? But I had fun with you today. You're tough. I was just following your lead, man. No, you did good. Proud of you. Oh, I'm s... Where's your freezer? Georgie, I was thinking. Maybe Joe should stay with us a little bit longer. - What do you think? - Yes. Baseball Basketball Weiner dog Short shorts Cigarette Surf board, ping pong, Rugby ball, wiener dog Skiing down on the beach Sports Sports Sports Sports Hoo! Man, you've got some rage in you, boy. You seem to be familiar with anger, too. Yeah, I am. And I found a way to monetize it. You know, I think I've always been this angry. I just... always had to repress it. You too? I became whatever I needed to be. You know, I adapt to people's styles. Whatever they want from me, I become that for them. Typical orphan syndrome. I went looking for my father once. He refused to see me. My dad would refuse to see me if he could if it weren't for my mom. Well, you're lucky you had parents. I mean, growing up, I just... I just wished I was part of a family. Mm. There was one nice thing he did. I had this bully in school. Pat McAllister. He called me a faggot every single day for years. Called my home, told everyone at school. "Faggot, faggot, faggot." It never ended. So one day I took his lacrosse stick, and I bashed in his skull. My dad paid everyone off. Came back on Monday like nothing had ever happened. That's some Mafia shit, man. I know, right? What's your name? It's Joe. No, I'm serious, I'm serious. Your... your real name. David. It's David. David. David. - Hit it. - Hello? Peter Ellison. Hmm? Who? The firm's investigator. Got a couple questions I need to ask you. Oh, you didn't have to come all this way. In person is best. Can I come in? Yeah, we're making margs. Do you want one? We were supposed to meet your sister a few days ago. She never showed. It seems she's disappeared. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, my gosh. That's crazy. - I... that's too bad. - I hope she's okay. At this point, we're not sure if she was aware of her father's passing and what he entitled to her. We're all trying to figure out what we can. - Mm. - Uh-huh, uh-huh. - What did the police say? - Nothing. She's fallen under the radar before, so they don't wanna file a missing persons report yet. Right now, I'm the only one looking for her. - Huh. - Huh. Oh. Mm. This is a beautiful home. Just the two of you here? - Yes... - Oh, honey, your foot. You... - It's my metatarsal. - Yes. - Do you, uh... do you smoke? - Do you smoke? - We love a cig... - A social... - I'm a social smoker. - Social... do you have a lighter? - I wouldn't smoke alone. - Um. - I... - Hmm. - I have to pee. - Oh... oh. Can I... can I... - Go right ahead. - Oh, thank you. Okay. I'd actually love a tour. - No. - No. Why? The... why not? Why not? The pool is right out here. I'll meet... I'll meet you guys out there. Yeah, you go. You pee, pee, pee, pee, pee, pee, pee, pee. Ugh! - What are you doing? - Getting rid of evidence. It's hydrofluoric acid. It evaporates the body. I keep this shit around. It's useful. - But they... but they're looking for her. - Leave no trace. - Yeah, but leave a body. - A body's the ultimate trace. What the fuck? And this is the dining room. - Where's, uh, George? - Don't know, you know? He pees in different places, so... Trust me, if a body turns up, they're gonna point their fingers at both of you. This is what we gotta do, okay? - Just trust me, bro. - You already said that, bro. - Oh, what's down there? - Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, let's... let's find out. Huh. George? Fuck. George. What are you doing? Nothing. Where'd you pee? Um, I'd... - I'd rather not talk about that. - Mm-hmm. What's that smell? - Hmm? I don't... I don't smell any... - I don't smell anything. I don't smell anything. It's gotta be that thing. - Mm-hmm, yeah. - No. Um... Oh. Ooh. Hi, honey. - What the fuck? - Um... oh. Okay. - That was my wife. - Oh. - She just started dinner. - Uh-huh. Yup. - Hates it when I don't show up. - I bet. No one likes that. I'm not in a relationship right now, but I can imagine. - I'm off. - Okay. - We'll speak again. - All right. Bye. Whew. That was close. Yeah, too close. Next time you wanna do something like this, run it by us first. - I did what I had to do. - Yeah, for you. No more going rogue. Come on. Why don't you make yourself useful and get that shit out of here? Fuck. God. Fuck. Need some action Young attraction Your skin-tight photographs online Got me worshipping your shrine He's kinda cute. He might even be cuter than you. - What are you doing? - What do you think? We're not hanging out anymore and I need to come. Like I thought. Enjoy pussy, sweetie. Hey, so, um, it's probably gonna take a while to clean and get refilled. Whatever you need to do. Hi. Hey. What's up? Nothing. It's just hot out here. Yeah, I know. I, uh... I had to take my shirt off just to get this job done. Blah-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. - What's your name, pool boy? - Rob. Well, Rob, I love white trash. You know, I'm actually, uh, getting my master's degree in philo... Shut up. Don't ruin it. Shut your pretty goddamn face. Nice suit. Nice hose. Fuck. - Get the fuck out of here. - What are you doing? Sorry, I didn't know that you guys were, like, together. We're not. Joe was just leaving. Don't make me do something I don't wanna do. Do what he said. Oopsie. So what, if you can't have me, no one can? - Don't. - Fine. I'll just get someone else. What do you think, you're hot shit now, huh? Oh, yeah? What are you still doing here, huh? What do you, want to be a family now? - Maybe I fucking like it here. - Oh, yeah? I really don't see Lux marrying a murderous townie with a nice cock. By the way, who sucks it better, me or her? Fuck you. Don't forget I can murder both of you whenever the fuck I want. Oh, yeah? Then what? Your DNA is all over this fucking place. Your sweat, your blood, your come. I'm a ghost, remember? Right. The ghost who will never be found. What are you gonna do with your share of the money? Keep it in that fucking truck? Yeah, do you wanna do it? Just do it, huh? Just do it. Why don't you fucking kill me? Just do it. Stop the grunting. You're ruining my day. I'm sorry. I'm fucking pissed. Well, yeah. We should have gotten our money by now. - We can't because Joe fucked us. - Yeah, he did. - Shut up. - Did he cramp with you? He cramped with me. I don't think he drinks enough water. If they can't find Caitlin, then they can't pronounce her dead. If they can't pronounce her dead, then we don't get the money. - So? - So we need a new plan. - Georgie. - What? What? We pin it all on Joe. That's kinda perfect, actually. I mean, all the, "Chowder, go Pats, fucking Fenway Park," whatever, I'm over it. I think we're both over it. And plus, he has killed way more people than us. I mean, he's so much worse. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah. - Okay, so we kick him out. - Yeah. - We get Ellison back in. He takes the fall. We get the money, and then, you know, we go back to just being the two of us. Fuck him. - Why are you being so fucking mean? - I am not mean, I'm honest. We're about to be rich again, okay? A part of society. We're gonna reenter the world, and you don't really match our new look. We've always belonged. You? You never did, sweetie. - I just thought... - Okay, let me be very clear. I employ you. You're providing a service for me and once we pay you, George and I, we don't ever want to see you again, mm-kay? I am going to go rent dresses online... oh, my God, I can buy them now! It's done. Ellison, we need you to come back to the house. Someone's been killing our family. Come in. - It's about my sister. - She contact you? - So she's dead. - What? Mm-hmm. - We befriended this guy. - Yeah. Well, I dated him briefly, briefly... a brief dating period, and with all the drama of the will, he went crazy. - Yeah. - And he killed Caitlin. Yeah. And so... but he's... he's an assassin from the, um... - Dark web. - From the dark web. - The dark web? - Dark web. I know, it's this hot new thing. We're... we're new to it, too. We're new to it. We don't... we don't hate it. - So... - Just call the pol... - Oh, shit. - What the... Stay behind me. He's locked the doors from the outside. We need to get to an open area. I'm gonna go check out the pool. - Are you doing this? - No, it really is Joe. Fuck. - Hey, I need to go, okay? - What? - No, where... where are you going? - Don't worry. Joe taught me how to kill. I'm gonna put those lessons to work. Ew. Ellison, I'm right behind you. George? Joe? Ellison? Oh, God, it's you. Okay, you know what? The police are on their way and Ellison is already here, you "Good Will Hunting" piece of trash. Ellison, he's right... I was right. He's right here. Oh, Ellison, yeah, that's, uh, that's the guy you killed, huh? With this gun right here? What the fuck are you talking about? No, wait. She took the gun and she fired it, but she missed every time. You stabbed him with this knife. You tried to kill me with it too, but I fought back. I had no choice. Fuck you. How dare you? I should have killed you both in your sleep. I told you she was thinking about it. You were right. We do need someone to pin it on. The thought of staying in this fucking house with you made this an easy decision. Besides, I've never had a boyfriend before. Gays never have your back. You should have really thought this one through. Your... your wedding is gonna be so... so tacky. Aah! You were right. It worked just like you said. That is the George I like to see. Fuck. Go. Go out the back. I'm here! - Freeze! - I'm over here! Hey, freeze, Get your hands up right now! - George, George! - George, George. Stop. Stop it. Please stop. Oh, God. Leave me alone! Driver, driver, take off. What you've been through, the death of your father... Yeah. The death of your sister you never knew, having to kill your stepmom in self-defense? What do you want to say to those people who see you and think, "He's not as innocent as he looks. He could have killed his whole family, framed everyone just so he could be rich." What do you say to those people, George? I don't know how to answer that. I... I don't know if I can. Try. - For me. - Okay, okay. You know, when I think about my life, I think about the series of events that led me here, all the struggles I've been through, losing both my parents, being the target of all these attempts on my life. - Being gay? - Being gay, Bonnie. Being gay, too. For sure, being gay. And what I tell myself every night before I go to bed and every morning when I wake up, is... Well, then, this... I'm a victim. I thought you would like that. That was beautiful. - I'm sorry. - No. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no, please. Wonderful to meet you. And it's okay. - I'm sorry. - No, no, it's all right. George's new book, "I, Victim, a Memoir," will be out tomorrow. And cut. Got it. Great. Thank you so much. Great to meet you. Bonnie. - Thank you. - Bonnie. Thank you. Wow, that was great. - That was great. - You're amazing. That was fantastic. - It's so good to meet you. - Oh, you, too. Can I have my water? Thank you. This place has been the site of more murders and disappearances than any other nine-bedroom manse in the area. So? So it's gonna take a bit to find some retarded buyer to come in from out of town and not do too much digging. - Whatever. I just need a change. - That's too bad. Really is so beautiful here. Eh, I'm looking for something bigger, better. It's just you, right? No, actually, I have a boyfriend. And there he is. - Oh, sexy. - I know, right? Mm. I'll call you. - Just get me my money. - I'll do what I can. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! What? Fuck off. Hey, what? It's here. I'm back, motherfuckers! - You got invited? - Yeah. Not only that, I'm the... I'm the guest of honor. That's amazing. - What's wrong? - I don't know. It doesn't feel like it's supposed to. Well, I mean, you gotta go, you know? You gotta see what it's like in there. It's... it's what you always wanted, right? It was what I always wanted... until I met you. Who needs a party when I have what we have? Besides, everyone's dead. We're selling the house. You know what they say. - Take the money and run? - Mm. I wanna buy you an island. Just two bloodthirsty, murderous fuckboys sipping coconuts. I fucking love coconuts. - Look at you. - Oh, where were you? I went for a run. I gotta go shower. Well, we gotta be at the airport by 8:00. You're all packed, right? - What? Where we going? - It's a surprise. Oh. Um, go, go. Go shower. I'll talk to you in a bit. Well, if it isn't the lawyer? - I do hope I caught you at a good time. - Um, yeah. I'm just getting ready for my night, that's all. - Yes, the Black and White Gala. - No, I'm not going to that. I'm flying away to the other side of the world. I'm afraid that won't be possible until some matters are attended to. Our new investigator has uncovered some evidence. What do you mean? What evidence? There are complications with your father's estate now and unfortunately, we'll have to file a court order to freeze your accounts. What are you talking about? What evidence, what complications? - Well... - Spit it out! There's another heir. - What? - Money brings out a lot of crackpots. Even though your father was, shall we say, not the most well-liked person, people have been trying to get at his money his whole life. Mary here kept very thorough records and before your father's death, there was one person who kept reaching out claiming to be Marcello's son. This individual was very hard to track down but we discovered he's a career criminal who solicits on the dark web. This is like a website for horrible things. Your father did his best to keep this man out of your lives. - I should have known... - He's a dangerous drifter. Growing up, I just wish I was part of a family. But birth records show he is definitely your half-brother. Sorry for the confusion, but he's been hard to pin down. Off the radar. Almost as if he's a... - He's a ghost. - Yes, exactly. I know losing the money is disconcerting. By the way, his name is David. Hey, bro. Are you okay? You seemed stressed out on that call. Yeah, um... it's just legal stuff. Legal stuff? Okay. I'm excited for this trip. - Yeah. - Come on. Do you want a snack? No, I'm not hungry. Okay. You know, why don't we, uh... why don't we take a bath together? It would be hot, you know? No, um, I... I actually should just... I... I should just go take a shower in... in the shower. Let's get ready for our trip. Right, bro? I can wash you all up, make sure you're nice and clean. Wow. I'm getting the feeling you don't wanna see me naked anymore and it's really hurting my fucking feelings. - No, that's not true. - It's not true? - No. - Okay. How big is that knife? Is it a big one? Huh? Let me see it. Let me see. Ooh. Oh, it's big. Give me that fucking... give me that fucking knife. Why'd you have to go and do a thing like that, huh? I thought we had a good thing going here. - You're a fucking psycho. - I'm a psycho? You're the one that grabbed the fucking knife, Georgie. - Get the fuck out of my house. - Our house, Georgie! Our house, remember? - You tricked me. - I didn't trick you. I would never lie to you. Georgie, we're family. Why put me through all this? I always wanted a brother. Come on. Give me a kiss. Take your fucking shirt off, and your stupid fucking ninja hat. Strip! - No. - Strip. Take your fucking pants off. Strip. Yeah, yeah. There you go. Let me see that skinny little body of yours. Take your fucking pants off. I'm going. You're fucking dead. Little faggot! Yeah, you're a little pussy. I think Dad was right. You are just a little fucking pussy. Oh. Say that again. Which, the faggot or the pussy? 'Cause you're both. Put the knife down. Put the knife down! - Put the knife down? - Yeah. What, you're gonna fight me with a fucking knife? You think I need the knife, huh? You think I need the fucking knife? What are we? Come on, come on, come on. - Ow! - Come on, come on, come on! Yeah, yeah! Come on, come on, come on. Get it, get it. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! Ohh... uhh... aah... aah... aah! Huh? Huh? What do you got, what do you got? Uhh... Throwing books at me? Throwing books now? You're throwing books now? Huh? Huh? What? Not bad, huh? Ow! Huh? What are you doing? Huh? Uhh... That hurt. That was a good one, bro. Hey. Bro. Bro, where'd you go? Bro. Ohh... Hey. Bro. Don't call me... bro. Welcome to this year's Black and White Gala. - George, how are you tonight? - I'm well, thank you. - How are you? - Oh, I'm doing great, George. - And you look fabulous as ever. - Thank you so much.
