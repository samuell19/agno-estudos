We're going to check with our judges here and see how they score it. Remember, we score each ride one to 25. One marking for the bucking horse, and one to 25 for the cowboy. Lew: BY GOD, LARRY, YOU'VE JUST BROKE EVERYBODY'S HEART. HEY, LEW, THIS IS KIND OF A HEART-BREAKIN' GAME. [ laughs ] HEY, THIS IS MY BOY BOB, LARRY. HI, BOB, GOOD TO SEE YA.

Rodeo announcer: Butch Cody, Cedarville, Kansas, and Witch Doctor. And ladies and gentlemen, that completes our bareback riding. Let's go to the calf-roping contest. AND HERE'S A SKILLED EVENT. A LOT DEPENDS ON THE FINE HORSE THE COWBOY RIDES. REMEMBER, THEY RIDE QUARTER HORSES NOT ONLY FOR SPEED, BUT FOR THEIR ABILITY TO WORK THE ROPE AFTER THE CATCH IS MADE ON THE CALF. LET'S GO TO THE ROPING CHUTE, AND ROY ECHEVARY of Clovis, New Mexico is to be our first roper. HEY, THERE'S ROYCE. HEY, ROYCE! YOU KINDA LIKE HIM, HUH? OH, YEAH, HE'S A GOOD GUY.

OH, WELL, TO HELL WITH HER NOW. - Announcer: The calf must remain tied until... - YOU MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND. YOU DO WHAT YOUWANT TO DO, NOW, YOU HEAR? HUH? BY GOD, THERE HE GOES! He makes a real fast catch and has everything goin' in his favor. Take a look at that horse work the rope for you. Earl makes a fast time. The flag comes down in the field. uncer: This could be the time to beat. Mrs. Brown, would you please report to your automobile? Your husband is there with your baby and the baby is crying. You have something the baby wants, and the old man is doing the best he can with the tools he's got to work with. Ladies and gentlemen, we ask the wonderful folks we'd like to have you meet here this afternoon, the sponsors of the Trancton Rodeo. WE'D LIKE TO ASK THE JOHN MOON FAMILY TO PLEASE STAND UP. How about a nice hand for this wonderful group? for the Parade Queen and also the Rodeo Queen, Miss Shirley Moon? There she is. Isn't she lovely? Now, ladies and gentlemen, back to the bucking chutes and the classic bull-riding events. Saddle-bronc riding time, where they ride eight seconds to the sound of the buzzer, ride with what we call an association saddle-- one hand in the buck ring, the other hand must stay free in the air till you hear that buzzer sound. Cowboy are required to spur up forward, over the points of the shoulders, and then continue to spur what they call fore and aft to gather points on the ride. Again, it's scored one to 25, one marking for the saddle bronc, one to 25 for the cowboy. There is a judge on each side, - looking for the cowboy's favor... - Rita: LEW, HONEY? ...and also disqualifications. And here's a cowboy to watch-- Larry Mahan, Crystal, Texas, five times all-around champ of the world. AND HERE WE GO, LARRY MAHAN OF CRYSTAL, TEXAS! [ crowd cheering ] HE'S MAKIN' IT TOUGH ON EVERYBODY ELSE. [ buzzer sounds ] [ horse neighs ] The score is a 75. And that makes him our leader in saddle-bronc riding. [ horse neighs ] Down before the buzzer, that'll be no score on his ride. HEY, DAD. Will you look at this? Clete Lomax will show you how you ride the saddle bronc. Last time Clete rode the saddle bronc, he set four world records. He went up the highest, stayed up the longest, - and came down the hardest. - [ crowd laughing ] Also kicked up the most dust. WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU, YOU DAMNED FOOL? YOU'RE TAKIN' SOME PRETTY HAIRY CHANCES OUT THERE. - OH, I'M ALL RIGHT. - Lew: YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH, I'M OKAY. - SURE, NOW? HELL, YES, I'M ALL RIGHT! Lew: THEN WIPE THOSE TEARS OUT OF YOUR EYES. IT'S A LONG WAYS FROM MY HEART. IS HE ALL RIGHT? YEAH, HE'LL BE OKAY. All set with Tony Martinez of Roy, New Mexico, on the bucking horse Trader. Trader has a little something extra, unloads Martinez before the buzzer. There'll be no score on Tony Martinez. GET OUT OF THERE, BOY. We're waiting for the horse to settle in the bucking chute. Here's Ron Moore, El Paso, Texas. [ buzzer sounds ] Ron made a great recovery and did score higher on riding. Let's see what our judges come up with on Ron Moore. AND THEY SCORE HIM A 73. NOT BAD. COME HERE. THERE'S A WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK OVER THERE, THE OTHER SIDE OF THOSE STANDS. THERE'S THE NUMBER. YOU WATCH AND SEE WHO GETS IN THAT TRUCK, AND YOU TELL ME, YOU HEAR? YES, SIR, MR. FERGUSON, I SURE WILL. LET'S WAIT FOR OUR JUDGE'S DECISION ON THE SCORE. - [ buzzer sounds ] - HEY, HONEY, YOU ALL RIGHT? - HI, FINE. - YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE GUM? YES. SAY, LEW, I'D GIVE HIM A LITTLE MORE REIN THAN THAT. HE BUCKS HIS HEAD PRETTY LOW. I'M GUESSING, BUT I THINK-- YEAH, THAT'S IT. THIS THING'S RIGHT. Now, ladies and gentlemen, to chute number seven, here's a cowboy we haven't seen much of lately, hometowner Lew Lathrop, right here from Trancton, New Mexico, next up in bronc riding. BEAR DOWN ON THIS ONE. LET'S WIN THIS ONE, DAD, JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT.

Tony Martinez of Roy, New Mexico all set for the ride. And here we go. Uh-oh, looks like Jelly Bean has done it again. Jelly Bean's just squaring things for the great ride that was made on him yesterday. There'll be no score on Tony Martinez. WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, WE'VE JUST RECEIVED A NOTE.

I HEAR YOU TALKIN' LIKE THAT AGAIN I'LL KICK YOUR BUTT. GO ON, AND TELL HER. OH, DAMN IT TO HELL. And Ron scores a 75. That should be enough for some of that prize money here today. And we'll go right back to the action out of the bucking chutes and more saddle-bronc riding. DAMN, WHERE DOES THE TIME GO? Here we go with Marvin Shelby. [ crowd cheering ] Whoops. By God, he really hits the ground Well, we hope you've enjoyed the saddle-bronc riding - here at Trancton, New Mexico. - I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, ROYCE. That winds up our event for this year. Now, ladies and gentlemen, to the steer wrestling or bulldogging, whichever you choose to call it. Again, they'll be riding quarter horses for the speed from a standing start. Here we go, Len Jensen... His time: 9.1 seconds. Here goes our next steer wrestler. - [ crowd cheering ] - [ steer grunts ] Floyd had a real fast time: 5.1 seconds. Abner Scrawley will be our next bulldogger. The flag is up and they're ready to go. And now, ladies and gentlemen, to our final contest event, the one I know you've all been looking forward to, wild Brahma bull riding, where they ride eight seconds to the sound of the buzzer. - HAVE YOU FOUND MANY SHACKLES? - NO. Not required to spur in this contest, but if they can spur, that's more points in their favor. You want to keep your eyes on our rodeo clowns during this contest. Clete Lomax, and also Wiley McCray, Larry McKenney will be out there not only for the comedy, but for the protection of the cowboys as well. They score the same, one to 25 point marking FOR THE BULL, AND ONE TO 25 FOR THE COWBOYS. AND NOW TO THE BUCKING CHUTES, AND OUR FIRST RIDER, JW Meyers, Lubbock, Texas, rider on bull number two. There will be no score on JW Meyers, as he failed to qualify. Now our rodeo clown Clete Lomax moves in with a cape to cape our bull. Why don't we go south of the border on this, as our clown Clete Lomax using the cape, now gets him down on all four here? He's going to meet him on equal terms. You notice the bull, he's digging a hole quickly. Also, there's a man in the barrel. He's still in there. Watch it! Watch it, Clete. Where you goin', man? HEY, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GO GET A COKE, HUH? - WANNA COME? - NO NO, IT'S OKAY. - COME ON, BOB. - Bull riding is the most dangerous of our events. The boys take a little longer in the bucking chutes getting ready for the ride. We'll move along now to our next bull rider getting ready in chute number seven. [ tires screech ] Well, ladies and gentlemen, here's the one you've all been waiting for. Let's go to chute number three for Larry Mahan. Bull, aught seven. Larry scoots right up close to his rope. Watch chute gate number three. [ cowbell clanging ] [ buzzer sounds ] Clete Lomax moves in with a cape to get the bull's attention. The bull now belongs to Clete, Larry and Wiley. [ crowd cheering ] But it's not over. Let's go to chute number six and Charlie Thompson from Lubbock, Texas, and bull 222. He is ready so watch chute gate number six. - 222 jumps right out of the gate... - THANKS. [ crowd cheering, whistling ] Look out, Charlie. He's coming after you. That was a close call, Charlie, the way you hit the ground. And bull 222 has dished out another hit. Come on, Wiley, get in your barrel and walk up closer to him. If he knocks you down, we'll have Larry McKinney pick you up. Well, I guess that bull's in a hurry. You must've scared him, Wiley. They give us the signal to go at chute number two with James Orgaine of Georgetown, Texas. [ buzzer sounds ] We have the score on James Orgaine. The judges give him a 68. Wiley almost jumped into the barrel. Now he's coming back to crawl in. That's it, Clete, keep him around the barrel. Look out, Clete, he's coming around your side. We dare you to do that again, Clete. Hey, Clete, why don't you show him some of those smooth matador moves with the cape? He doesn't seem to like you or Wiley. He's going for Larry McKinney. That's it, Larry, show him - some of that fancy footwork. - SAY, ROYCE, HOW'S IT GOING? Well, you've dazzled him, so he's decided to leave. WHERE YOU GOIN', BOB? HEY, WHAT THE HELL-- WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOB? DAD, HERE WE ARE, WORRIED THAT YOU MIGHT BE IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE. NAW. WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO TO HELL! WHAT'D YOU SAY? HEY, BOB! WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH HIM? WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK'S THE MATTER WITH HIM? COME ON, CLETE, I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANY YAPPIN' FROM YOU. - BOB, WAIT A MINUTE! - LEAVE THE KID ALONE. I WORRIED MY ASS OFF HALF THE NIGHT WONDERIN' WHERE YOU ARE, THE RODEO IS DAMN NEAR OVER, THEY'RE JUST READY TO TURN YOUR BULL OUT, AND YOU DON'T WANT NO YAPPIN' FROM ME. WELL, YOU'RE GODDAMNED SURE GONNA GET SOME. I'M GONNA GO KICK THAT LITTLE BOY'S ASS. HE JUST TOLD ME TO GO TO HELL. NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY, CLETE! IF YOU DO, IT'LL BE AFTER THE FIGHT. [ cowbell clanging ] I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU AND YOU'RE GOING TO LISTEN! - YOU'RE NOTHIN' BUT A-- - THE HELL I AM! YOU'RE NOTHIN' BUT A PILE OF TRASH, AND I'M THROUGH WITH YOU. ONLY TIME IN YOUR WHOLE DOGGONE LIFE YOU COME ANYWHERE NEAR BEING SOMEBODY AND YOU HAVE TO MESS IT UP. YOU'RE SO DUMB, YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH END'S UP. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW "COME 'ERE" FROM "SICK 'IM." ARE YOU THROUGH? YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I AM. YOU STAY AWAY FROM THAT KID, YOU UNDERSTAND? LET'S GO HOME, BOB. I DON'T WANT TO. - BOB... - DO AS YOUR MA SAYS, BOY. COME ON. ...with no chance for the score. Wiley and Larry have been having a ball out here. Just for that he gets to fight the next bull. [ crowd applauding ] Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget the big rodeo dance in downtown Trancton at the Civic Auditorium, starting at 8:00 sharp. There'll be a real fine western band to entertain you, and dancing will go on until 1:00 PM. HEY, CLETE. GOD DAMN IT... COME ON. And they need the money, so let's help them out, folks. Well, we rolled in ahead to chute two, and the rider Clint Meyers, El Paso, Texas, is all ready to go on Bull Redman. He gives the nod and here he comes.

THEY OUGHT TO TURN THIS BULL OUT-- THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER RODEO. - [ crowd cheering ] - [ cowbell clanging ] - [ buzzer sounds ] - There's the buzzer, but Everett was on the ground long before it sounded. Man: WHOO-HOO! And out of the chute, Rene Ramirez on Grego. - [ crowd cheering ] - [ cowbell clanging ] [ laughter ] EXCUSE ME, MR.

Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready again for the bull riding. We're going to go to chute eight and Paul Pinn of Phoenix, Arizona, had drawn Bull R-66. He's ready and he says "Outside." That bull had his number, and the bull dropped him before the buzzer, so no score on his ride. Wiley and Larry, while the action heats up, this bull belongs to you. What's that? You don't want him?
