Establishment of the State Mandschukuo Spokesman: 1932 Japan appointed Manchuria in the North-East of China... to the sovereign state Mandschukuo. The imperial army there could... react and rule without any political control. Prime Minister Inukai was shot by seven men. Spokesman: Since the time of the Shogun there were men in the country who maintained the art and tradition of karate. What they learned from their ancestors they passed on to there next generation. However, in a world of upheaval they were confronted with a heavy fate. (Taho) Section, stop! Look left! Imperial army police. Captain Tanihara, headman from this section. You have to follow our command strictly. Please tell us what you want. Our Lord Commander, Commander of the seventh police unit, Hidehisa Goda, issued that we have to expropriate and commandeer this building, at the time called "Shibahara-school", immediately. It belongs to us now. You have to go. (Choei) You can't... You can't be in earnest! Be quit! What use does your unarmed art have? We have other concerns, our country is threatened by real enemies! Whit respect, Captain, I don't want to be impolite, but our karate school, our Dojo, is approved personally by the emperor. Giryu, get the certificate. Master. No! - This is just a sheet of paper! I'm confiscating the school. Get out of here! What are you gazing at? No! No! That has to be a mistake. Can't you leave for today? Give us one more day! I'm sure everything will be clarified then. - Hands off! Choei! You are a criminal. I'll get you for this! - Taikan! Don't! If you want to fight, then inside the Dojo! - Taikan! Come on! - Taikan! Karate is not about attacking, it's about staving of the attacker. Remember! You aren't allowed to hit or to kick your opponent. That's what I taught you. It's a duel. Whatever will happen, don't take it personally. May I, Captain? I am Mamoru Yoshida, Lance Corporal from the imperial army police. Fight! (Takimoto) How did he... Yoshida! You bastard! I'll take over. Fight! You... He is dead, Captain! - What did you say?! The next one. - Murderer! Taikan. That's enough. Giryu, you continue fighting. Master... - Didn't you hear me? You both should fight. Giryu. If you follow the teachings of our master... and lose the fight, then I'll finish it. Come on! I'll introduce myself, too: Police Captain Kiichi Tanihara. I'm a student here, my name is Giryu. What are you waiting for? Come and kill me! Or do you want to bear with that shame forever? Captain Tanihara. - His hands. Please do something! Master. I know, I was never as good as... Taikan or Giryu in karate. And without my arm, I'll fall even further behind. And therefore, Master, I can't be your pupil any longer. Master... Master! Master! Master! Those policemen will come back. And then don't do anything , no fighting against them! Even if they are wrong. Under no circumstances, understood? Master, please explain me one thing: You always forbid us to fight. You allow neither... hits nor kicks against the enemy. Why do we practice, if we can't use it? What's the point? I don't understand it. Please explain it to me, Master! Taikan... - No, let me! All your strengths should bundle and operate from inside. Because you'll mature this way. If you attack you'll never reach the perfection... and the highest level of art. Who should understand that? I think we'll get ahead... only with a duel, because it makes us stronger. What's the use in defeating someone weak? Such a victory serves only your arrogance and makes you weaker. Choei. - Yes? Go and bring me the belt. - Yes. I want you to coffer it. Master! The Kuro-Obi (Black Belt) should belong to the one, who will be the next master of this school. And only this one should wear it! That doesn't mean that it will be one of you at all costs. Choei. You'll decide who's worthy it. Master! You have to decide it now. Master! The colour black never becomes dirty, the same goes for the belt. The color of the Kuro-Obi is the colour of willpower. When the time has come, you'll understand. Master. Master! - Master! Master! Master. Master... Here rests Eiken Shibahara. I still don't understand. In order to become strong, there is only one way. We have to fight. Giryu. Why didn't you kill the officer? This man was the loser in the duel. Now he has to endure this indignity. You coward. Hey! Look there! The imperial armed forces will include the karate martial arts... from the school of Shibahara in the training of their recruits immediately. Signed: Commander Goda! You have to obey! From now on you'll work as instructors for the army police, understood? Get your things! The headquarters already expectes you. (Choei) Why did you agree? Let them forward. I am the son Tanihara. - And I am his daughter Kaori! Giryu killed our father. - Giryu? That's nonsense. Wait! He didn't kill the Captain! Our Lord Captain Tanihara took his own life! That can't be... The fight was a terrible indignity for him. And it's your fault! Instead of living in disgrace he chose the last way out! What are you waiting for? Kill me! Or do you want to bear with that shame forever? Giryu! Come on and fight! Stop it! - Choei, keep yourself out! This is Giryus business. Now bring it to a termination. We challenge you! Kaori! Stab! Now! Kaori! Stab! Do you want to bear with that shame forever? Giryu! Did he fall? - Yes! Taikan... - Let's go. Have you already forgotten the teachings of our master, Taikan? My training should give them power and endurance. That's were karate starts. Please forgive me. Is it painful? - No. Welcome home, father. How is the boy doing? - He is awake. Well, that was about time. You were lying like dead on the wayside, beneath the stream. - Yes, and I've found you! Your wound isn't as bad as it looks. In a few days you can get up. Thank you very much. Will you tell us what happened? I understand. There are things which better remain unsaid. Does it hurt much? You are good! I've worked on the fields my whole life. Don't! - Kenta! Come now, sit down and eat! - Okay. Hana, where is your father, when he leaves in the daytime? He has to work, because what we get from the agriculture isn't enough. We are poor. I bet you will be happy if Giryu stays here forever. Am I right, Hana? - Kenta! What did you actually do before we found you? I was... What are you waiting for, kill me! Or do you want to bear with that shame forever? Stop, everybody! I see you have already experience. - Yes, still from my childhood. You're reacting to my movements. For a lame street fight this should be enough. But what will happen, if your opponent has really good body control? Are you ready? A repetition. A hit at that place can be killing. But training won't help here. The hit one gets no more air... and dies finally painfully by suffocation. (Goda) Oh! What a demonstration! Salute! Attention! The Lord Commander from our unit: Hidehisa Goda! Welcome. You are Taikan, right? You took a shine on me immediately. Nobody is allowed to smoke here. You're really someone. Well. I wanted to tell you that there will be a festival in honour of you tonight. And there we'll have the opportunity for a conversation. In privat, if you understand. Hm? Taikan. Oh, you don't seem very amused, Taikan. Do not worry, it's not poisoned. Take a sip. Or am I the reason why you look so grumpy? You are charming. And at the same time so masculine, that's great. Stop messing around! - Taikan! Are you well amused? I'm taking a seat. Taikan, Japan appointed Manchukuo to a sovereign state. And that means, new wars and conquests will certainly follow... in other countries soon. Therefore we need more training facilities... and more space for the strength training of our army police forces. Thereby we count on men like you. For the benefit of the Fatherland. And also for our own well-being. You're not sleeping at all. I shouldn't... - Stop. Wait, don't leave. You're pretty. You think I'm pretty? Kenkichi, you jackass! Get out! Get a move on! You're boozing again! - Mr. Tsuchioka, I said... that you please shouldn't come here... - Did I say... you should play and lose? Pay us back as much as you have. Please, could you give me some extra time? Stop joking around. Well! To be honest, I see only one way out. Sell us your daughter Hana, and all problems are forgotten. Hm? Get out of here, you vultures! - Oh, do you want trouble?! Father! Don't you dare doing something to him again! - Oh! What a little militant guy. Kenkichi! Think about my proposal! We will come back. Let's go. - Well, then... Father! Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay. Is not that bad. This certificate is insignificant, it's totally worthless. This school now belongs to the army, we'll take over the Dojo. The building has to be evacuated! (Ohmoji) Taikan is very strong. No one can defeat him. With his help, we confiscated five other karate schools so far. (Goda) Our next traget is here. A very pretty facility. (Ohmoji) Taikan will like it. The karate style... master Togo Takaomi teaches there, his very similar to his own. And it's said, that he is one of the best fighter far and wide. It'll be a special pleasure to watch the battle between those two. I'm looking forward to it. - Mr. Commander, may I ask you for what purpose we are actually commandeering all these buildings throughout the country? One half of this training facilites will become training camps. I see! - The other half will belong to me. And when the time has come I will earn money with them. Especially with this one here. And for this business idea you shall be my partner. Yes, what's it about? - About women of course. I see... - We all know: With women is always something to get, they sell excellent. Yes, right! - Because Taikan is our man, it will be easy to commandeer as many houses as we need. He will do it blindfold. Master. That's right. Don't throw away what you have. Let's go. Hana! Please forgive me! Hana! That can't be! You... you villains! - Kenta! Don't! Let my sister go! - Kenta! Quiet, kid! Let me! - Just you wait! Don't do anything to him! Little brother! - Don't go, Hana! Kenkichi! Don't you want to tell them? Your family seems to take us for the bad guys. Kenta! Forgive me. Your father ran into heavy dept with gambling, kid. And we only want to help him getting rid of that debt. Don't worry. Where Hana now goes to she'll get wonderful dresses and everything else, what she needs for a good life. Hey, basically you should be grateful for it. Your aren't allowed to take Hana with you! I won't permit it! No! Kenta, stop it! - Let's go! Giryu! Do something, now! Giryu! You can keep them from doing it! You can hit them, you can fight against them! Giryu! Giryu! So you want to fight, right? Do you want to or not? Giryu. I thought as much! So you are scared. Come on! - Yes... I hate you, Giryu! You coward! You Idiot. You Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Kenta! Sister! What do you want? - I'm setting off. Where to? - I'll go into the city and save Hana. Forget it. - You coward aren't doing anything (so I have to go)! Kenta, wait! Wait! Kenta ... - What is it? Listen. When your sister is in a save place, I will bring you back home immediately. Is that clear? First of all we have to find her! I can't understand you. You're offending against everything... what our master taught us. - Didn't he taught us also... that we should go our own way? That may be true, but he never taught us to destroy other schools. The expropriations are not what interests me. I only want one thing: And that are strong opponents. Choei, you're a weakling just like Giryu. And weaklings shouldn't wear the Kuro-Obi, right? Am I not right?! Stop! Your master has left our world, like I heard. As sign of my condolence. We are thankful. There is the rumour that the pupil of Master Shibahara... are attacking other schools and taking away the roofs over their heads. I have to say that that's true. - You're Togo, right? Taikan, you are unworthy to wear the belt of your master ever. Hey, Giryu... - What is it? I'm hungry. We haven't eaten anything since yesterday. Have a bit more patience. Over there! That's them. They are so disgusting. - Be glad that we aren't reporting you. And? Who has the 2? - No 2 in the game, then just the 3. The 3 draws, who plays? - I'll play. First number! - Uncover it! The 7 hits the 4! - You're all cheating! What did you say? - Give it a rest! Hey, out of here! - So, next round! Who makes the game? I think I'll get quite a decent price for you. Who has the 4? Who dares? - We expect our customer today... or tomorrow at the latest. He has accepted the prize. What do you want? - I want back my sister! Are you looking for trouble!? - Tell me where my sister is! Kenta, get out. Let go of me. (Tanabe) Throw that guy out! You! Get lost immediately! You, just wait! Out of my way. You have some nerve. What are you thinking, just popping up here? That's enough. Don't stir from your spot. (Tanabe) Hey, Giryu! Look here! Be quiet, ok? You act like I say or his head will roll! Giryu. - Now listen well! Your little Hana will be sold to a brothel. There she will be a comfort to our suffering soldiers. Just as it is right for a good servant. In any case, you will never see her again. Let him! - Deposit him! Stand up. Come on. If I... You little rat! Help us! They will beat him to death! Boy, what are you talking about? - Please help us, help! Otherwise they'll beat Giryu to death! Giryu? Show me the way! Where are you going to? Taikan! Where to? - This way! Look who has come?! - So it's the four of you? Lo and behold! The small lout called for help. Form up! Cut him down! Stop messing around! Finish him off! Stop! Stay here! Great! Giryu. Taikan... You look bad. - This is my fault. Did they threaten the boy? You drank Sake. - Yes. I like Sake. And women too. Finally I realised how life really goes. Giryu, abandon that dream from a pure heart. The world isn't made just from good things, but also from bad things. Those who want to be strong, must have something from both. Don't look so stupid! I've got enough from your naive attitude. You still have your abilities. Giryu. Giryu, you can fight as good as he, I know that very well. You should have battered those criminals a lot. They wouldn't have been able to do something against you! Giryu, you're an idiot! Yes. Yes, I am. A giant idiot. Giryu. Hey, rest a bit first! Giryu. Giryu... So, we arrived, Lord. Mr. Commander, we expected you already. I'm sure you'll be satisfied. They are only the most beautiful girls. Please come in. Oh! Here we have a pretty little thing. Something very special. Hey, hey. When I think of tomorrow... Unfortunately my day is very busy. So three of you should be enough tonight. Don't you agree, Ohmoji? Who are you? Dirty dog! Giryu! It's alright. You nerd! Is he called Giryu? - Yes. How can that be? But he was quite tarnished. Actually, he had... Did you throw him into the river, like I told you? Yes, of course! Right? - Yes, of course! He walked off with the girls. All units should go... and look for the man immediately. I demand... that you catch him alive in any case, got it? Our execution-commando will execute him. But Mr. Commander... This Giryu-guy assaulted me outrageous, therefore he has to be outacted. - I understand, Commander! Good! - Yes. Today, the fight between Taikan and Togo is taking place. That's why I'm leaving now. I want to see this duel personally. Very well! Damn it! Tae? - Father! Oh, what a joy. Kenkichi, the gambling club was a false front from the very first. - That can't be... They always had it in for our daughter, so that they could sell her. I was there to look for my Tae, and there someone told me the truth. No. - Father! What is it? The duel can begin. Start! Master Shibaharas belt, the Kuro-Obi, belongs to this fights winner. You, Choei, will make that sure. Alright. Master. Master! Stand up. Taikan, it's enough! - Stand up! No! Taikan, tell me - why? Better dead than an eternal loser, in my opinion. You can believe me, Togo would say the same. You're a ... a monster! I'll never forgive you for that! What a surprise! There is still a fighter in you. Only your technique isn't worth anything. The belt belongs to me. Are you still doubting it? The wanted Giryu was found. Giryu? This army-police unit hereby gets the command to arrest at the Ensai-Temple a guy called Giryu, who abducted some women. - Yes! Giryu is a criminal of the worst kind. Therefore I allow the use of firearms. Understood? - Wait! I know Giryu very well. He would never abduct someone! - How dare you, to speak with the commander that way!? Taikan. Don't you care what happens to Giryu? Do you want to watch how they shoot him? - That's not my business. Wait, Taikan! There's one thing I know: If there is anyone who doesn't deserve the Kuro-Obi, then it's you! You certainly don't. Taikan! They are back. They want to get the girls. I won't allow that. - And what do you want to do? You don't attack properly and hit them like the other guy. Do you mean Taikan? - Yes, this guy. Ah, if he was here now. Karate doesn't mean to strike. The aim is not... to batter others. Karate means everything to me. It's like a holy teaching for me. - Yes, but they are criminals! Kenta! - But it's true! If there is anyone who doesn't deserve the Kuro-Obi, then it's you! You certainly don't. Damn! Karate is not about attacking, it's about staving of the attacker. Remember! Your aren't allowed to hit or to kick your opponent. That's what I taught you. Giryu! You have something that belongs to us! Cough the women up! You have some guts. How pathetically, look at them. Get lost! Move forward and snap them. - Yes. Those sissys don't even have the courage to fight back. It should be easy for you to finish them off. Choei! - Giryu. I hope you're still loyal to the teachings of our old master. Come on, execute them! Stop! Giryu. Any resistance is pointless. One wrong action and I'll make you being shot. You won't... What are you thinking? Fire! Taikan! Taikan... - I need only one finger, to kill you. - What? Are you trying to threaten me? You are nothing more than an arrogant and corrupt Officer. And Giryu belongs only to me, understood? - When did you... It would be an extremely painful death. I don't think you want that. If your men only think of moving I'll kill you. Understood! Don't worry. He will regain consciousness. You of all people shall be a dangerous criminal, what an irony. Giryu, this time... you won't be able to escape. Choei, you will be our witness. Let's start, Giryu. Come on, Giryu, strike back! Do you believe that you can win only by defence? Giryu... That's it. (Eiken) All your strengths should bundle and operate from inside. Because you'll mature this way. If you attack you'll never reach the perfection... and the highest level of art. Now I can understand. Now I can understand the words of the master. Who can stave off or parry... the attack of the enemy better, is the stronger one. I want to thank you. If you hadn't diverged from the path of the masters, I would have never learned it. Your attacks are so good that they demand everything from me. Thank you. That was the right way for me, Giryu. Taikan... - You deserve the belt. You are the best. Taikan. Taikan. Taikan! Spokesman: Taikans last words were a deep duty for Giryu. He accepted the Kuro-Obi and with Choeis help he founded... his own karate school. The school wasn't big, but many aspired to learn there. Thanks for watching! Translated from German to English by Maysn If you find mistakes - you can keep them! XD
