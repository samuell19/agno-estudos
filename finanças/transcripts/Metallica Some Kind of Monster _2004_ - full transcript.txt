WOMAN: Okay. Go ahead, pull it out. (indistinct chatter) WOMAN 2: Thank you, sir. ZACH HARMON: So, uh... what we're gonna do is we're gonna play back some of the band's new songs. There'll be no cameras allowed in there. There'll be no video, no bags in there. You can only walk in with paper and a pencil. MAN". We're ready. WOMAN: Okay. Go ahead. HARMON: Are there any questions? WOMAN: Okay. (rock music playing) Want it so? Camera over here. Hello? (beeps) Was there ever a moment you-you thought about stopping with Metallica, or the whole band was falling apart? Was it a kind of a power struggle between you and him? REPORTER 3: How did you manage to solve this crisis? Where in God's name are you getting all this aggression from on this new album? Where's it coming from? Why did it take so long to release an album with the new songs? REPORTER 4: After 20 years, is it possible to retain the fire that, you know, you guys once had at the beginning? Do you think the young generation of met-metal fans will... accept the new album? 85 million records, 22 years... I think it's 11 albums in various official releases. One word...

(cheering, whistling) After 14 years of head-banging, Metallica bassist Jason Newsted has quit the band, citing “private and personal reasons "and the physical damage that I've done to myself over the years while playing the music I love." Metallica's management had no comment when asked by MTV News if there's a replacement waiting in the wings. But the band is still scheduled to begin recording a new album this spring. That's the news for now. Stay tuned for more news... PHIL TOWLE: I mean, I think everybody understands the concept of trusting instincts. That's getting to a place where you don't let egos and let... stuff get in the way of... artistic expression. You know? So, I mean, this... I mean, do you want to say any more about that? 'Cause, I mean, I think everybody understands that... I met Metallica through Q-Prime Management after having seen me work with another band of theirs. When they called and said that Metallica... with Jason, uh, announcing that he was exiting the group... needed to take a look at itself and say, "Well, what's going on here? We've lost touch with our personal relationships." And face some of the issues that I think Q-Prime felt that they were headed for. You know, we haven't really worked together for almost nine months. When we were talking a couple of days ago about whether... you know, if we wanted to do this film or not... I was wondering if having these guys in here... would affect that. Yeah. 'Cause I'm just... ...there's an intimacy that you get when it's just a few people in the room and I'm just wondering if that's going to get lost. If we're gonna go back to sort of, like, battling each other and trying to be, like, all strong and... What intimacy? What the fuck are you talking about? (laughs) TOWLE: I think, to me, it's not going to be a matter of whether the cameras are in play, but whether or not you guys are free enough to risk being seen by other people. (intro playing) HARMON: We're here, uh, in the Presidio in San Francisco, and this is going to be the location where Metallica is gonna start recording their next album. BOB ROCK". We decided that we didn't want to go back into a studio again and do kind of like the same thing we had done before. We had to kind of... change things up. And this is one of the things that we talked about, was to go into a space that's not a studio, bring in kind of like a portable studio, or a makeshift studio... That's good. ...and basically make the situation uncomfortable. HARMON: You know, don't buy new furniture, don't paint the walls. Don't do anything. Just keep it Spartan, keep it crude. They're such a success that you can get comfortable. I don't think they want to be comfortable. Well, there's definitely a vibe in here. They've got a lot of attitude and I think they want it to come out on this next album. How did you approach this record differently? I mean, did you talk about things, did you have ideas, key words, things like that that you wanted to put across before you actually started putting the whole thing together? Well, ego was a big one. Uh, coming in here and not bringing a riff, not bringing a song, not bringing a title. Nothing. Uh, me and James did not meet somewhere else and come in here with material. With songs. With music. This time, we all got in a room and just started playing. And that's how we wrote songs. (playing a riff) BOB ROCK: The idea is, it should sound like a band getting together in a garage for the first time. (guitar playing) Only the band's Metallica. II' JAMES HETFIELD: I really like going fast. Just go off and meditate in the wind, you know? As corny as it sounds, it-it works, and it feels good. It's a good way to... just let the weight of the world off every once in a while. It is it is kind of strange being... you know, like a famous guy. You know. This is... this is part of me that's trying to be unfamous, I guess. But it's also go-against-the-rules attitude. You know, is this some big pose? I mean, yes, this is a pose. I mean, am I driving down the street to not get noticed in this thing? I mean, rebellious is kind of what this says, (laughing): I would say. (engine revs) II' Have you got a plug in here? Wait, wait, wait, so what exactly are you doing? ROCK: Well, you'll just hold it above the... the pick ups. HAMMETT: Oh, okay. I gotcha. (guitar wails) HETFIELD: Yeah!

Gonna have to, uh... HETFIELD: Change the lyrics? (Hetfield laughs) (buzzing) I like this thing, Bob. ROCK: What? I like this thing. II' ULRICH: I used to kid myself that art was my great escape away from music. And I think I've become increasingly aware that my interest in art, music, and Metallica... is not separate from anything. You know, what does he feel that there's enough of that... kind of gold thing? How come there isn't... another 20 strokes up in that black area up there where it's... where it's kind of bare? Where are the starting points and where are the end points? Do you know what I mean? When's a song done? What the fuck does that mean anyway? "Done." When's a record done? (little boy shouting) You know, when... where does a record start? Where does it end? Urn, where does the process start? Where the process end? All that type of stuff. Do you know what I mean? MYLES: Daddy! It's really interesting. Yes, sweetie? II' I don't, I don't feel anything great there. ROCK Yeah, he didn't know... HAMMET: I don't think it's that great a riff, either. How do you hear the riff, then? ROCK I like that (singing riff) and then... Mm-hmm. (both singing riff) HAMMETT: Yeah. (all playing the riff) (seagull squawks) HAMMETT: In nine days, it'll be my two-year anniversary of surfing. It's taken the place of a lot of bad things in my life. So I-l basically stopped doing the drugs that I was doing and, uh... cut way back on my drinking. You can't surf when you're hung over. You can't surf if you've been up all night... well, at least I can't. (laughs) There's a-a sort of individualism, also, about surfing that I like. I mean... when it... when it's your moment, man, that's your moment and yours alone. And no one can help you. (laughs) (laughs triumphantly) (trolley bell clangs) ULRICH: For all intents and purposes, we-we go into this record completely equal. Everybody contributing just as much on the lyric front as James contributing with drum parts and... As soon as you started talking about that, I just, like... (laughs) HETFIELD: Yeah. Yeah. You flash back now? (laughs) Well... You want to hear it with vocals? BOB ROCK: I said... Go sing it. ROCK". You guys had some rules about that before. Quite frankly, I don't give a fuck. I'm tired of arguing. ROCK". You couldn't talk about his lyrics, therefore, he couldn't talk about your drumming. ULRICH: Right. (laughs) ROCK: Do you know what I mean? And... you and him did the solos... (Ulrich laughs) ...so you weren't allowed to comment on the solos. Do you know what I mean? There was, like, rules. HETFIELD: Oh, definitely. Are you telling me that... that those boundaries are gone now? (all chuckle) ULRICH: In the past, what we did was started with a bunch of ideas existing on tape from everybody. Then me and James would sit down and turn those ideas into songs and then we would tell the rest of the band what to play and when to play and how to play it. There was never any... just other ways of doing it. HETFIELD: You know, it's just a whole new thing for me. You know, writing in front of everybody... 'cause I've always just gone into my own head and wrote stuff down instead of taking things from outside and putting them down. ROCK: You know, I was thinking this is like, "these are the hands that da-da-da-da, this is the face that da-da-da-da," so it's like... Building a Frankenstein or something? Yeah. Pretty much. Building what? A Frankenstein. This is the top of my head that's flat... (laughs) These are my bolts... II' HAMMETT: We're on the same stream of consciousness here. We're just all working on the same creative wavelength. And it's inspiring to me. Now I can further express myself with these lyrics, now that, you know, James has opened that door for-for Lars and I. This is "clay," right? HAMMETT: Yeah. Not "clam"?

Yeah, I'm getting better at that, you know? And... 'cause that was the most I... I missed my family ever, you know? Right. And it was, you know, Castor's first birthday I missed. Right. And it was... Well, of course we had a little... vodka! To Castor, you know? Oh, sure. Did a little shot for him and everything. But I, I would've loved to have been able to get a hold of home. (guitar strumming) Look who's here! This is Dad working. This is where Dad works? Yeah. What does your dad do for work? Drums. Trying to get the drums? Yeah. Uh-huh. Let me play drums. Daddy, want to play drums? (Hetfield laughs) I-I played drums a lot today already. I'm okay. You play for a while. (singing gibberish) (laughs) MAN". Those guys... That's very good. ...you know, their plate is filled with many, many things. And music is just one of the things. Say, "Bye, James." Bye, James. Bye, buddy. I chose to not have children and do those kind of things. My music... yeah, that's my children, you know? Daddy's gonna stay and work for a little while. Yeah, but since I decided to do it with music, then that's what I have to fill my time with. Echobrain is one of the projects that I've been working on for years. And now it's come to fruition. And then when it comes to the time where my main cat James tells me that, you know, basically he couldn't be in a band with me if I did the... took this other project to this level. And after 15 years of working together and go on busses and you know the stories, man. There was no way that this thing that I was doing could affect the monster of Metallica. I just don't see how it could. And so in saying things like that, I-l couldn't accept that kind of, urn... limited... acceptance. I also know that this relationship is not over. You know, he'll-he'll co... it'll come around again at some point. You guys'll make contact. NEWSTED: At that time, the manager suggested that we have a psychotherapist come in. A man that meets with pro ball teams, you know, big ego, big dollar guys that can't get along but have to make some kind of entity flow so everybody else and everybody can make their money. And, uh... I actually said I think that this is really fucking lame... and weak that we cannot get together-- us... look... we... the biggest heavy band of all time... and the things we've been through and decisions we've made about squillions of dollars and squillions of people. (stammers) And this? We can't get over this? MAN: Was it more than just the Echobrain thing? 'Cause that's, like, you know, what has been discussed. HETFIELD: He felt like he wasn't free enough to do what he needed to do, uh, since he wasn't getting his creativity out enough in Metallica. He needed to get it out somewhere else. And I totally understand that now. And, um... on my side of that was I didn't want him to enjoy that more than Metallica. I didn't want anyone to leave Metallica. I didn't want to feel that we weren't enough or something like that. And it was through my... Oh, I guess the way I learned how to love things was just to choke them to death. (chuckles) You know? Don't go anywhere. Don't leave. You know? You have to stay here. Okay. I need a pen. None of this pencil shit. Check it out, man. Can't even fucking spell it right. "Metllica" We've only been together 20 years. (both imitating drum beats) I feel guilty that I'm not inspired all the time. You know? Especially when everyone else is. It's, like, okay. We-we kind of get to the point where the song is looped twice in the Pro Tools and I know Bob's gonna hit me up for some kind of lyric ideas. Oh, shit. I was, like, dreading the whole process. It's like... why are you dreading it? Why don't you just...? TOWLE: Well, you're dreading it because of what? Now, let's get to the fear. Well, because I didn't have anything or...

Metallica front man James Hetfield has entered a rehabilitation facility to undergo treatment for alcoholism and other undisclosed addictions. In a statement posted on Metallica's official Web site, the band writes: "James has entered an undisclosed facility "and he will continue to receive treatment "until further notice. "Until then, we have postponed "all current activities "including recording sessions for our new album." Metallica, whose hard-partying ways earned them the nickname "Alcoholica", have been working on their follow-up to the 1998 double disc collection of covers...

Let's say the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, you know, and all that inspired some of the British rock music that then developed after that. And, let's say, the metal music and... and Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath and all of that. And then, out of that again, then, let's say, then came Lars and all of that and being... So I think that... that they have certainly, uh, a place in all of that, I think. Lars had a very good vision, at the time, of where he saw that particular... you know, the metal music going, because he could see with European ears and eyes, maybe. Yes, actually. Don't you feel that it's great for you to have your father's perspective on... on who you are and what you're doing? I think that's incredible, and it's... you know, talk about the lineage... which we did. We talked a little bit about your grandfather... I mean, it's very difficult to admit it, especially with him standing next to me. I... it's easier to talk about when he's not in my presence. But, urn... of course it is. Yeah. What would you... what would you say in private? To who? To anybody, without him here. Say it. You know, what... what would it be? Well, I mean, I've already said it to you countless times. Well, have you said it to him? (laughs) Urn... TOWLE: What is it that you... you-you brought it up. I didn't bring it up. What is it you feel you've said that you're not saying now? You can... you know... ULRICH: I think maybe in some ways, some of the, urn... TOWLE: To me, that's... A fear of status quo comes a little bit from this direction over here. I think that, um...

II' (indistinct talking) TOWLE: So I think one of our responsibilities here is to act like a band that's still continuing. We're going on. We're doing our exploring. We're exploring ourselves individually, we're exploring our relationships. And, uh, we really need to... get together, talk about this, act like the band exists... because it does exist. And if we don't do that, then we are the co-producers of the process slipping off the planet. It is a bit of a shit sandwich, though. What is it... the unraveling of a band? (laughs) And then there were two? HAMMET: Yeah. You know... ROCK: So... Uh... a good friend of mine phoned me. And he knew where James was. ULRICH: Really? Yeah. He couldn't even imagine James doing anything for six months. I'm prepared for the worst. I'm pretty confident that, you know, we will come together when the time is right. But... knowing when that time will come... or not knowing when that time will come is very, very uncomfortable. ULRICH: I hope that, at some point, he will come back and try and finish the making of this record. If... If he walked away from Metallica, I'm not sure that it would surprise me.

II' I can remember from the Dave Mustaine days, I mean, when him and Dave Mustaine-- these guys, they started, like, right away with their big, you know, chest beating and their mannerisms, and the whole thing was very much about this kind of, like, macho and it was just... Like, I couldn't deal with that stuff and, I mean, looking back on... I mean, what is that-- 18, 19 years ago-- I mean, I just felt so alienated because it was just so far removed from the upbringing that I'd come from. Well, here's to you, my friends. ULRICH: But then, at the same time, I'm starting to realizing now that the sort of depressive things that show up as a result of the alcohol and stuff like that. It was just very difficult for him to communicate from the heart. You want some or not'? Not hide behind a lot of these different fronts. Whether it's alcohol, that gives him a false sense of strength or... the front man in Metallica or, you know, macho bullshit and all that stuff. All right, now you guys are drunk and I'm drunk. Now this is the fun part, man. I want to help him. I want to be there for him. And I want to do the best I can to make him the best person that he can be. So I-I don't know how the fuck it's gonna play out. II' HAMMETT: It's really healthy for me to be here. Without any pressure or anything related to the band or... anyone who would remind me of-of the band. And, uh, recognize what's real. Our sessions with Phil really stirred up a lot of things in James that he felt that he needed to address. Mentally, it's really taken... taken its toll on myself. You know, it's... I'm-I'm very worried about him. And, you know, whenever you check yourself into rehab, they don't... they don't focus on, you know, the fact that you're an alcoholic. They go much deeper, you know? I mean, they go way deep. They crack you open and then spill you out and-and examine all the things that are on the table. L-I've spoken to him a few times, and, you know, I know he's having a-a rough trip. HAMMETT: No matter how bad it gets... eventually, things seem to sort themselves out, sooner or later. Whether it's good or bad, they sort themselves out. MUSTAINE: I watched people around the world say, "What a great guitar player Kirk is." And what a piece of shit I am and that I, uh... got kicked out of Metallica. And I wasn't good enough for them and that I was a loser and... (sighs) ...and I've had to deal with that for... almost 20 years. And it's-it's a dreadful experience. It's been hard, Lars. It's been hard to watch everything that you guys do, and you touch, turn to gold and everything that I do, fucking backfire. And I'm sure there's a lot of people that... they would consider my backfire a complete success. You know, and, and am I happy being number two? No! You know? You're just now encountering something I've been going through 13, 14 years. I've never had a chance to be able to tell you without... talking to Lars, the guy in Metallica. I've never talked to my little Danish friend again. You know? I remembered the day you and I talked about digging a hole in fucking dirt and smoking hash through the ground. That, to me, is the, the stuff that's, like... (chuckles) You know? And we've never had... very many moments like that. Do I feel some guilt? Uh, yes, I do. But at the same time, it's difficult for me to comprehend... that... the only thing... that you feel when you look back on the last 20 years... is rooted... in... the Metallica thing. Okay. Have you ever thought what, what I've been through? I think I've had an awareness of the pain I caused you, urn... That's not what I said. Okay... um... Do you have any idea...? Of what I've put you through...? What...? No. No. No. What I went through? I mean, people hate me because of you. You know, I, I walk down the street and I hear some piece of shit say, "Metallica...!" to me and they do that to taunt me. I mean, when I would hear Metallica on the radio... I would be like, "God, I have to turn this off, "because I just keep thinking, 'I fucked up."' Right. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. You know? And by no means is it done, because... somebody else very important is not here. Right. Do I wish it was 1982 all over again, and you guys woke me up and say, "Hey, Dave, you know what? You need to go to AA"? Yeah. I'd give anything for that chance. DAVIS: ls there any last words you want to say to everybody out there? Metal up your ass! (laughter) Okay, thank you. This is Donna Davis and this is Metallica. (indistinct conversation) MAN". This is, like, a pretty bitchin' club just to play a first fucking gig. DON KIN: Yeah. How're you guys feeling? (scoffs) Freaking out. Totally stoked, man. SAGRAFENA: Freaking out...? Yeah. Totally. (laughter) Totally. Freaking out, man. It's unfuckin' unbelievable is really what it comes down to-- can I say that? Yeah, you can say whatever you want. Great. Great. Yeah, it's fucking unbelievable. WOMAN: Echobrain! Yeah! I don't know. I-l just... All of a sudden, this became, like, such a big production. I don't understand. It's, like, all of a sudden, like, you know, I get, like, one phone call. It's like everybody and their fuckin' brother in town. I thought it'd be Jason, like, playing with his new bands... band for, you know, like, 20 drunks down at some bar or something, and now, I guess, to my own ignorance or something, I-l... That's what... I guess that's what I wanted it to be. So, now I'm realizing that... supposedly, it's a little more of a big deal than that. ♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh“.I (instrumental interlude, featuring guitars) (song ends, applause, cheering and whistling) Hey, man. What's going on, man? Thank you, man. Hey, man. Thanks. Thanks, man. Thanks. (indistinct chatter) Awesome... Oh, thanks. Awesome. Right on. I'm Lars. Oh, really? Nice to meet you. Great to meet you. Uh, thanks. Where's Jason? Oh. Jase? I don't know. Uh, dude, I think he went back to... I think... I think he went to... I think he already fucking bailed. Think he might have went back to... Did? Really? Nice. Wow... Go back to say "hey", and he's, like, fucking gone. Elvis has left the building. There's Zack. Hey, Zack! You need help, or are you all right? See, he's even blowing me off. (laughter) I know. Jason blows me off, Zack blows me off. How quick we become yesterday's news. (laughing): Yeah. No-no kidding. See, there's a guy in an Echobrain T-shirt. Yeah, that's Steve over there. He works at the studio with us. (laughing) Well, he is. Really? Yeah. I remember that guy. Huh? I remember that guy. He worked at the studio. Which guy? Over there. The guy in the red shorts? No. No, the guy in the black that's walking across right now. Really? Kessel. Todd? He works at the studio, too, doesn't he? Who? Todd over there. I'm sure they're all here, Bob. I mean, the only two people in the Bay Area not working for him is me and you. Yeah. Hetfield's gonna freak. I'm in fucking hell. This whole gig has brought all of this on, hasn't it? Yes, it has. You really want to come clean. It's made me feel like... It's made me feel like such a loser. I mean, I can't hold my band together. You know? I start records, I don't finish them. I fucking... I... Oh! (sighs heavily) Jason is the future, Metallica's the past. ROCK". I've never had a break like this. In 20 years. Do you know what I mean? And just what's been kind of getting me is... is just not knowing. Do-do you know what I mean? Not knowing, and not hearing-- that's just like... It just eats away at you. Kirk talked to him. HAMMETT: I talked to James today. Just me and you. ROCK: Oh, cool. Yeah. TOWLE: What did he say? He basically said that... you know, he just... His family's the priority right now, and he needs time to work on his family before he can reach out to his other family, being us. And that he loves us, and... he just needs for us to... to understand that he needs time. And he also went on about... how difficult it was talking to-to you about it, because he felt pressured. And you know, he-he spoke about how you always need to be in control of the situation, or in control of the schedule, or whatever. And he said that this is a time, he needs complete control of the situation. And he said, you know, all the Marc Reiters, and the Bob Rocks, all that... all that stuff, you know, just has... I-I can't think of that right now. So, you know, I got the feeling that he kind of lumps in your relationship with the business side of things, which was actually really surprising to me. But I think that's... You know, that explains a... I think that explains a lot, on why he hasn't spoken to you. ULRICH: We're just in limbo, and the longer James chooses to stay away from dealing with us, the further we drift apart, and I just feel... so... disrespected. That-That's the key... the key thing. MAN". Was the future of the group ever in doubt, even when James went into rehab, do you think? Lars and I-- uh, we-we were wondering when James was going to finally feel like he was in a situation where he can come back to the band. And after a certain amount of months, you know, Lars and I started to think. Well, is he ever gonna come back to the band? And that was a really big question on our plates. Whether or not, you know, he wanted to come back. II' ULRICH: James wrote something in the new issue of our magazine, So What. He wrote a kind of a little handwritten note. That note was probably the most heartfelt thing I'd ever seen come from his mind. Tomorrow is... shaping up, or is gearing itself up to be, yes, the first to sit down with one James Hetfield post... uh, rehab. Yeah. Yeah. Is that...? Why are we filming this? I don't know. We're in very different places. Or, at least, I am in a very different place than I was from the Presidio. (laughs) That's a huge understatement. So... we just have to find that if, you know, if the movie will be as intense, you know. To-to me, there was a lot of intrusion, and I kind of went with it, and felt... I felt uncomfortable. I felt uncomfortable with it. You know, a boom following me around. And it just felt like I was in the spotlight all the time, and I didn't... I-I guess I don't really like that feeling. When we were in the Presidio filming you guys playing... Mm-hmm. Did you feel it then, too? Yeah. It was... it was pretty much all the time. SINOFSKY: I mean, do you think you're in a better place now? I mean, we got to find some... I'm definitely in a better place. Having some place that makes you feel comfortable. And the last thing we want to do is have it impede on your music, because that's more important than anything. BERLINGER: Right. You know, one-one answer may be there... Maybe there shouldn't be a film. I mean, that-that's the range of possibilities that we should really think about, because... I mean, why do you guys want to film? Even you said that you hope that the film is made. I mean... That's a big question, 'cause for me, it was really just... it came along with being in Metallica. "Hey, we're gonna do this." "on, okay." That's part of this, all of this... (laughs) ...the bigness of Metallica, and I'm kind of tired of it. You might look at it as a friend; to me, it's... it's been a beast. And it's sucked a lot of me into it. (Towle clears throat) You were maybe the keeper of the beast at one point. You know, because you were the champion of-of that fifth... that entity. ULRICH: And, of course, you got to just find the right balance between what everybody's personal needs are, but if Metallica collectively decides to do this, then I think Metallica can make it happen. I don't know. That scares me again. Metallica is... three individuals. And three individuals have to decide if it's good to do. ULRICH: But... I still think that the priority is the collective until all the people involved in the collective say that the priority is the individual. And so far, you're the only one that said the priority is the individual. I haven't said that, and he hasn't said that. I haven't heard him say that. So, I feel that, it's still... there's still an unbalance there. HAMMETT: We met from, like, maybe-- I don't know-- six or eight weeks before we actually picked up the project again. That was when we came in, and, it was the first time we actually used this studio, HQ. Anyway, here we are. HQ. (laughing quietly) HETFIELD: Right on. Well, we're-we're here. And the cameras are here. And my friend the boom is here. (laughing) ROCK: Hovering. Yeah. Cool. Want me to play the music? Yeah, let's go. I'm... I'll put the big speakers on. HETFIELD: I was afraid to pick up a guitar. And fearful what would happen. Would I not like it? Would I love it? Would I not be able to write anything cool? Would I write just recovery stuff? James? It was probably the best sound I've ever heard in my life, was the fact that you were playing guitar in here. MAN: Hey, Zack. Right on, brother. ULRICH: Play a riff. (Hetfield playing riff) (others join in) ROCK What? Nothing. See? Feels pretty good, doesn't it? HETFIELD: Yeah. Feels like the next day. (laughter) A year later, the next day. Now, that's a stretch. (chuckles) It's gonna be interesting working on-on the schedule, 'cause we really haven't. It's gonna be great. HETFIELD: And kind of the overview is, you know, the less time you... we have here, the more productive we'll be. In a way. You know? It's like we're more focused on getting the stuff done. ULRICH: That all sounds really good. (chuckles) Okay. Now, let's revisit it in a week. (chuckles) So, um, I think that... don't talk it, walk it. (clears throat) ROCK: At some point, we are gonna have to work a little harder. ULRICH: Yes. Yeah. When that feels right. HETFIELD: What do you mean? What does that mean? What does that mean? HETFIELD: Yeah. When you say harder, does that mean more hours? ROCK You know, if we can... go deep real quick. Be intense. Uh, I spoke up because what does that mean? We have to, you know, do eight hours now and... I got fearful right then. ROCK That's okay. Yeah. I mean, it's like... yeah. To do eight hours? No. (Playing guitars) ULRICH: Any lyric ideas?

Maybe Bob doesn't want to sit in there and... When I'm gone, things get talked about and then decisions are made and I feel I walk into something that's already kind of decided. And it's a total uphill battle for me a lot of times. I don't like that feeling. Well, that's like... just like the last 15 years. - Yeah. -For me. - Well, let's talk... let's-let's talk about this tomorrow then. Or do you want to take the time out? No, I don't have time right now. Okay. It's past 4:00. Okay. It's hard to introduce structure into this. TOWLE: Uh-huh. And I'm trying. TOWLE: So what do you think, Lars? Can we hear the song from yesterday? That we all heard together. HETFIELD: How is that different? Because we all heard it together already. TOWLE: Well, what he wants, to be a part of everything.

I think you control on purpose, and I think you control inadvertently. I think you control by the rules you always set. I think you control by how you always judge people.

No, your dada's staying here, okay? Oh. Bye. See you. So what's-what's the deal? How's everybody feel about what they heard? Of course, lyrics will definitely work in that fear. ROCK: Yeah.

Was there anything in particular that you... No, I wasn't paying attention that detailed. That's just, it's-it's a lot of good stuff. ULRICH: I can take you back, when me and him were alone in my room, in 1981, listening to New Wave British heavy metal singles. As soon as there was somebody else in the room, it just became this, like... It just had a very different energy to it. Any of that, that was usable? Yeah. That's a fuck... Maybe let's... That's a fucking bitch. Let's-Let's do another version of it, okay? ULRICH: The first time I-I got a real awareness of it was when Mustaine came into the picture. When James was with Mustaine, he became like he never really cared about me. There was one time during the recording of the Ride the Lightning record where me and him went out and... So, 42 beers later, is like, "Ooh, dude, I love you." But it could never have materialized until it got to that 42-beer point. And we were alone. (exhales) ROCK That was good. Are you sure I don't have to play it again? Yeah, I'm sure. It's good practice, though. For what? The road. When? Couple years. HETFIELD: From day one, it's been competitive. And, in a way, that's what has made Metallica what it is. That's what's driven us further. ROCK What feels good to you? Uh, b... We'll try a bunch more. Can you try maybe, like a... (softly sings melody) Almost like a strum. HETFIELD: My parents split when I was 12 or 13. And then my mom passed on when I was 16. The only thing I felt that I really had, at that point, was music. My wanting to keep everything under control and, you know, it's out of a fear of my abandonment issues. I'm afraid to get close to people, 'cause I don't know how to do it; I don't know how you're supposed to do it. ROCK Cool! Yeah, that last one was pretty good. Yes. That's the first amp I ever owned. That right there. II' I think we have it. HAMMETT: Okay. ROCK: Okay. Now we got to talk about it. ULRICH: You started talking about the idea of the guitar solo as we have known it maybe being something that was a little... outdated, and maybe reintroducing some riff-a-rama things. But can I say something that I think is bullshit? This whole fucking solo out... you know, dates the whole thing-- that's so bullshit, you know? If you put a guitar s... Or if you don't play a guitar solo in one of these songs, that dates it to this period. And that-that's cemented to a trend that's happening in music right now. I think that's stupid and I think it's totally trendy. I know that's not what I said. ULRICH: It's always been about, like, where could it go that's kind of new and interesting instead of just repeating something from the past? HAMMETT: I'm not interested in playing traditional guitar solos anymore. You know, that's just... For me it's... it's just boring, you know. And you told me that. ROCK To me, if you can add a color to the song that-that satisfies you and works for the song, then that's what we should do with it. But I don't want to get in the position where it's like, we put something down on the tape to satisfy your ego, my ego, Lars's ego or James's ego. I think it should serve what's going down. Like, in other words, there shouldn't be, like, a rule of no solos. There shouldn't be a rule of solos. It should be... And I agree. I mean, it really is, to me, all about serving the song, and, you know, I feel much better about that, because, you know, I-l... I just don't want to follow certain trends that I see other bands following. We don't necessarily have to stick to our traditional way, but we also don't have to follow that trend. II' I'm actually very, very comfortable with my role in the band, you know? I've actually always been very, very comfortable with my role in the band. I'm not a really egotistical person. (phone rings) In fact I've... I've spent a large amount of my time trying to, like, downplay my ego, and get it even smaller and smaller. That's part of my beliefs. I try to be an example of being egoless to the other guys. (drum beat playing) HAMMETT: Hi. This is Kirk from Metallica. And if you want money, you'll listen to us. And then some other guy's gonna give you some cash. ULRICH: 20 years' worth of integrity, and, you know, credibility and all that. The next five minutes is gonna change all that. Hey man, uh, keep it locked right here, and... What? "We'll help you score $1 ,000." Oh. This is James from Metallica. Survey says... you need cash. (laughs) (laughs) Your money shot to snatch a bunch of cash is coming soon. In order to suck both nationwide radio chains off, we, uh, are now standing here, having to do this fucking stupid thing. Up to 50 motherfucking grand, goddamn it. Win a bunch of money. And walk away. (laughs) This is stupid! Sharpen that booger-picking finger and be the 50th... Hey, it's Lars from Metallica here. I'm about to stick 50 grand up your ass. (laughing) HETFIELD: One dollar at a time. (laughing) I was telling Lars last night-- that was hard for me to see you guys squirm like you were. Yeah. I... Because I want to say anything, and it's not my place to say anything. I can't imagine, uh,Bono or The Edge going on the radio, saying... what you guys are being asked to say. Dad, can I have one of those? Go for it. CLIFF BURNSTEIN: Should we catch up on all this radio stuff? ROCK: Yes. HETFIELD: Uh-huh. Okay. Now, they're the biggest chain in America. You know, it's like 75, 80 stations or something. And if you guys think it's crappy, as a radio thing... those guys think it's good. I mean, that's their idea; we didn't come up with that. So, strategically... HETFIELD: Why are we doing it, then? Just to make... them happy? Yes. That's exactly what they're doing. And they won't say, "Fuck you, you never do anything for us. We're gonna fuck you on the next record." People would do that? Because you didn't give us something, we're gonna fuck you? Yes, James. (laughs) They would. I'm not saying that they can always get away with it. That's so funny. I'm glad it's your world. But it wouldn't stop them from trying. I understand the "wash your back, you wash mine" thing. You know, wash my... I'll wash your back so you don't stab mine. Right. That's more like it. Okay. Why don't we get off the phone then? MARC REITER: Well you know, we should have those conversations some more next week. Later. BURNSTEIN: Okay. REITER: See you. BURNSTEIN: Bye-bye. HETFIELD: That's insanity. We're gonna hurt you 'cause we didn't get something. HAMMETT: I wash your back so you don't stab mine. TOWLE: Well, that's a good line for a song. HETFIELD: I guess I just want something to rhyme with "mine" right now. (Rock laughs) ROCK Wash your back so you won't... Wash your back so you won't stab mine. Step on a land mine. I want to keep you in my back pocket. ROCK: Blind leading the blind. You don't... I'll rip out your fucking spine. HETFIELD: Okay.

Oh, sulking. II' ULRICH: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (crash) Shit. In the 11 months since he's parted company with Metallica, ex-bassist Jason Newsted has been apparently more musically active than his former band mates. While Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was pursuing Napster and singer James Hetfield battled alcoholism, Newsted hooked up in the studio with legendary metal band Voivod. Our own Ian Robinson got all the answers on Newsted's new ventures and the current state of his relationship with Metallica. ULRICH: A good friend hinted that Jason would really like to join the band again. Man. I popped his little bubble for a second, and I don't know, man. ROCK I'll be quite honest. I think the heart and soul of Metallica, from this point on, and has been for a while, since Cliff died, is the three of you guys. I think you will never, ever, ever find a permanent bass player. My opinion. WOMAN: There was also tragedy in rock this week. Metallica's bassist Cliff Burton was killed in a bus accident while the band was on tour in Sweden. He was 24. MAN". Metallica bassist Cliff Burton was buried on Tuesday in the San Francisco area. The remaining members of the band... MAN 2". Jason Newsted. He replaced Cliff Burton, who was killed in an auto accident in September. Jason told MTV... it pisses me off that Cliff left us, because we'd never have that initial four guys just going on and on. And, you know, when I talk about it, it's, like... that happened for a reason. And we're... we're dealing with that. TOWLE: I got to capitalize on what- what's being said... Just got to deal with it. Right here. The Cliff message that I get from him to you guys is that treasure the three of you. Treasure every moment that the three of you have. And the four of you have. You know, treasure... treasure it, because... you never know. And one of the sad things that happens when somebody dies is that people have never taken the time along the way to really embrace each other every day, you know? It's a sin if you... you know, if you let that go. (sighs) HETFIELD: Phil has been like an angel for me. He's been sent to help me. And, you know, I've got my own thoughts about all that. You know, and a father figure, the dad that never was, and all of that, that it makes me comforted; it comforts me. But, also, we don't want to have our hand held through life. We'd like to be able to stand proud ourselves, and... and-and-and move on. There'll be a time for that. And we just have to discuss when that is. II' TOWLE: You know, there is purpose behind the way I do it. I think it's very effective. I have to decide whether I'm going to push it, or not. It sometimes is a distraction. So, what part of our career are you going to manage today? I thought I'd do the whole thing, Huh? Since you guys can't do anything. I mean, you know, if you guys could run something, then it would be easy to step back. (laughter) 'Cause you can't, you know... it's... got to be someone. Is today the first day you're going to play drums? I don't want to get into that. Okay. You know... I don't think I'm gonna do the drums. I think it's time... Maybe I should. Uh, yeah, I think it's time. Yeah? Although, actually, I'm kind of... Well, it's about the only thing you haven't done. Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. I-l haven't sung. All right. What? We, um, got to a point where we sat down and told Phil that we wanted to scale Phil back, urn, to, uh, every other week. And, uh, we were getting ready to implement that four weeks from when the decision was made. And two weeks after the decision was made, urn, we had to sit Phil down and say that we were not ready to do that. Because we got really, urn... I don't know, uh... scared, I guess. There were some things that were going on at the time that really Phil helped with a lot. ANNOUNCER: Live from the news leader in Northern California, news center four, Night Beat. The Metallica versus Napster battlefield moved to San Mateo today. Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich delivered a list of screen names of people who have downloaded the band's music online. MAN". Metallica is suing Napster, a Web site that provides software which allows people to download music on the Internet without paying. MAN 2". Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich testified before a senate committee earlier this month that Napster has quote, "Hijacked our music without asking." MAN: The band said that over 350, 000 people are downloading its music for free. WOMAN: A group of former Metallica fans staged a protest at the courthouse. I don't want anything to do with Metallica anymore. I'm going to be crashing their CDs. I took all my CDs, and I'm going to be destroying them. Are you proud of what you achieved with the whole Napster thing? Are you proud, in hindsight, of what you pulled off? Being the most hated man in rock and roll? (laughs) Yeah, that was, uh... that was my goal. "I got an idea. I'm kind of bored this summer. "Everything's going a little too well. "Let's see. Uh, I want to turn myself into the most hated fucking asshole in rock and roll." Yeah. Like, good afternoon. My name is, you know, like, Lars Ulrich, from Metallica. I worked for years to get where I am today. Me and my buddy like James Hetfield here have shed blood, sweat, and motherfucking beer to get where we are today. Beer! Good! Who do you think you are? I mean, just you know, because you, like, made us rich, you think you can get free stuff? Songs that we spent upwards of, you know, like 24 to 48 hours writing and recording. Our team of lawyers and researchers have your names, and you Napster users, we'll see you in jail getting gang raped. ULRICH: Some minutes, I have all this strength, and I can stand there, and just go, "Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! "I'm bulletproof. It doesn't matter. I got Hetfield and Hammett, and we're a team, and fuck you." Do you know what I mean? And then, five minutes later, it means nothing, and I just become really vulnerable. ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... ♪ ULRICH: You know, we never sat there and thought about where Napster was going to end up. We never sat there and talked about what shots we were going to take. We just sat there and thought about, this was something that we had to do. MAN: So, wait a second. (band stops playing) That was awesome! It's like I had to stay on the course that I was on, and stay to my convictions, but it was eating away at me inside. And then, maybe it could go lyrically to, urn, "What difference did I, slash we, actually make?" It's a great question. Great. And if that could... It's like if that question could get thrown out there, but remain unanswered... Mm. ...I think that's really strong. ♪ All the shots I take ♪ ♪ What difference did I make? ♪ ♪ All the shots I take ♪ ♪ I spit back at you ♪ ♪ Oh, oh... ♪ (Spits) "All the shots I spit back at you." T hat's awesome, dude. Fuck me. Right on. And the "What difference did I make?" fit right in. Really awesome. Right on. These two kicks-- are they the same as...? GILLIES: It's different. Okay. Go to the master. What... really gets my dick hard is boom... starting on "boom boom." We can do that. (humming rhythm) You know, there. Then these are awesome. (instrumental interlude, featuring guitar and drums) CRAZY CABBIE: Lars, what I want to know is... What? Do the four of you just go in there and just jam? You're hearing excerpts of three-hour jams. You're hearing... It... Look at it as a funnel. You're hearing the very part at the bottom of the funnel. Right. You can almost equate what we're doing now to arranging. Right. ULRICH: Yeah. CRAZY CABBIE: You're like Pollack, the painter. He is-- he's Pollack, the, uh, funnel arranger guy. CRAZY CABBIE: It's gonna sound fucking amazing at the stadium with 100,000 people, and fucking raising the evil horns up to the sky, and saying, "Metallica, baby." (gasps happily) Oh. ROCK: Oh, my God. Can we fast forward to that right now? (cheering and chanting): Metallica! Metallica! II' (whistling and cheering) BURNSTEIN: I think what I 'd like to do is, I'd like to talk about this touring thing that has come up. We're very cognizant of the fact that, you know, things have changed for you guys. And they've changed for many, many reasons. Why can't we figure out what works best for everybody in their personal lives, plus, what works best as a business? What if you just do a stadium tour where you play Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and then, you go home the rest of the week? I just want to put out that, you know, it might be a kind of an uncomfortable vibe here, 'cause people might not know how I'm feeling about touring, and I don't really know, either... (laughter) you know, until I get there. Yeah. And... you know, I I want to tour. I don't want to fall off the wagon, you know. I don't want to go out there. I don't know what it's like. Doing things for the first time again-- as I think I've said before-- it's a little scary. (applause, cheering and whistling) I don't know about you, uh, but, uh, it's, like, summertime and to me, it's, uh, fuckin' beer-drinkin' weather, yeah? Yeah. Well, I'm gonna take time right now and fuckin' have myself one, and, uh, just want to say cheers to all you guys and fuckin' thanks for coming down and getting nutty with us, man. Cheers.

(chuckles) But I went there, and, uh, we just did warm-up stuff like this, and this is the tape. And I've had this same tape for... since then. (vocalizing in falsetto range, then sings down the scale) REPORTER". Was there a turning point? ROCK". Yeah, I think when we had accumulated what we thought to be, you know, a great kind of, uh-- I don't know-- cross-section of material, we took stock, so to speak.

"There's no fuckin' let-up." "Fuck ballads." You know? There definitely is some Presidio stuff that I felt maybe... you got to analyze it. Maybe you're... watering it down in some way. That's all. (chuckles) It's your call. HETFIELD: Yeah. HETFIELD: "Temptation," I remember writing that thing. It came out... it flowed totally instantly. "Temptation" kind of sums up all the lyrics that are in this new... kind of... project... so... And that... And it's cool, because that was done long before "Recovery" and all that, so... HAMMETT: I mean, I can tell that you're singing your-your heart out. You're... definitely wearing your heart on your sleeve in... on that song. ULRICH: To me, it's more like a jam. Urn, is there a song in there? Urn... potentially. Urn... You know, there's almost nothing there that can't be turned into something better than it is or something that could... probably get pretty fuckin' close to being something on a Metallica record. You know, but then it just goes away from what the purpose-- at least what I see the purpose being today-- which is show up with what you... you know, what are your A-pluses? You know? Well, when I hear Lars talk about we can whip anything into decent shape, I agree. And we did that on Load and Reload. HAMMETT: Yeah. And this is us trying to choose before we take it to those extremes, you know? ROCK: Exactly. That makes sense. Yeah. HETFIELD: That was a pretty major thing that I think Lars and I clicked on together, that, wow, I'd heard him and he heard me. Huh. It's like, "Oh, okay." It's like it takes the cutting edge off of it, or the personal attack off of it, you know? Things are a lot less dramatic than they used to be within the chemistry of the four of us. Less head games, abuse of power and soap opera bullshit. But... Can we just do one thing? For lack of a better word, when it comes in with the drum... uh, drums, I just want you to scream "fuck" as hard as you can fuckin' scream. HETFIELD: ♪ Can you stand up? ♪ Fuck...! ROCK: Okay. It should be slower. It should be more like... fuck. Aah! I want four of them. Do it again. STEVEN WIIG: Lars is selling paintings because he's ready to move on to the next... ten years or next decade or next phase of his life. And a lot of what these paintings and a lot of what this house represents is the last ten years, versus 8... husband and father of two. He's getting rid of... some pretty major and important pieces in the majority of his collection. He's wiping the slate clean. ULRICH: Midnight, New York City. One last look at the paintings. Oh, well. This is a celebration. It's a celebration. (chuckles) Of how far you've come. It's a celebration. With Phil Towle. This is a celebration. Oh, yeah. Right. Some paintings have visited us for a while, and now we want to share them with other people. Nice. Okay? It's a choice. Right, yeah. That's it. Okay, cool. I never looked at it as an investment, but I always looked it as... versus some of the other guys that may be, like, taking a big pile of money and parking it in the bank. I would always, like, take a big pile of money and park it on my wall. Wow. I can just feel some of the adulation that other people have thrown at these paintings, and that makes me proud. Wow, I've never been this close to it. These are great paintings, whether they sell for a dollar or for $100 million. The only thing that matters is what pleasure and what feeling you get out of that moment you have with that painting. And it's never been about dollars and cents. It's always been about something greater than that. But, fuck, they do look awesome. I mean, fuck. (laughs quietly) (grunts) It's been a good time. And it will be a good time. To the future. I feel better about this than I thought I would, actually. It's weird. I don't know why. Yeah. Shit. AUCTIONEER: $300,000 on the telephone. It's two of you in the room.

Brett, yours at $5 million. All right. All right. Whoo! It went well. I, urn, got myself drunk to numb the pain. Urn... but it went well. I'm “EDDY- TOWLE: Like, let's talk about the zone for a minute. There is a way to help a person get... persons get in a zone. To... I mean, you could consider seriously doing some meditative or... app-apply the meditative principles to music, all right? I hope this doesn't sound too way out, but if you do that, the four of you are out there and you do it anyway, unconsciously, you do a... you do a musical meditation by starting to-to jam with each other. ROCK I just think, no matter how you look at it-- I've been making records a very long time-- and it really comes down to how much work you put in and how much, you know... It's just tough. Sometimes it's just... it's just tough work. And I like to stretch the frontiers of what people accept, okay? And I understand about that, and I... I don't want for my mind to settle... "The zone... admission is believing." Well, I guess I'm not gonna be playing today then, huh? Well, I'm gonna go out and make phone calls. So everybody's... TOWLE". You know, we've had a fabulous few weeks with a lot of great productivity, a lot of really good stuff going on. The more we feel good about ourselves and each other and the higher we ascend, the more challenging it will be... it will be to our psyches. You-you know, I understand it, I embrace it and all that stuff, but someti-sometimes it just bugs me. I think the, uh... that thing was kind of buggin' me yesterday. All of them around the studio, it was just kind of like... That way of thinking, it just doesn't work for me all the time. And I was a little pissed off, uh, at it because right now in my life it's not really working for me. L-I'm glad to know that's what you think. I agree with that. Wholeheartedly. And if you feel that way and wish to share that more directly, I'd appreciate that, too... ROCK: Rather than tearing the signs down? Yeah. We pay him $40,000 a month to be pretty much available at our beck and call. So when this record's done, do we want to collectively end the $40,000 a month... full-on thing? I'm afraid he's under the impression that he's, like, in the band, you know? HAMMETT: Yeah. And I see him coming on the road, maybe, for a week. But after that, I don't... I don't see him... uh, holding our hand any further than that. So is that something we want to present to him then? HAMMETT: Yeah. I think, um... Okay. I think it's something... Yeah, I think it's something we need to do for our own well-being. Yeah, 'cause I'm-I'm feeling uncomfortable. (playing riff on guitar) ROCK Are you there? Hello. Hello, hello. Are they on the phone? ROCK: Yeah, they're on the phone and they need you now. Oh, okay. ULRICH: James Hetfield is in the room. Hey, there. CLIFF BURNSTEIN: Hey, James, how you doing? HETFIELD: Pretty good. BURNSTEIN: I'm gonna let Marc... do the talking here, because Marc was the one who's been talking to MTV. REITER: Okay, so, um, this afternoon, the official offer came in for Icon. Assuming you want to do it. ULRICH: Let's do it. Cool, man. Right. Yeah, I'm jazzed about it. The only thing that you guys are required to do is show up for rehearsal and then show up for the show on the third, and at the end of the show, you guys take the stage and perform a little bit. So what's Jason's role in all this? What? Who? BURNSTEIN: Okay. REITER: But if I... I mean... I don't think Jason has any role. BURNSTEIN: He lost his icon status when he left Metallica. (laughter) REITER: Nice one, Cliff. Thank you. I think MTV would like the fact that this would most likely be the introductory performance of Metallica with a new bass player, whether it's the new member or whoever. When is it supposed to be? May what? REITER: May 3. Saturday, May 3. See, that means you'd have to hire someone by the second. (laughing): Okay. I think it can happen. You'd be required to be in Los Angeles for all of two days... Because we didn't get a new bass player, I think a lot of people thought maybe that we were having trouble finding one. We never started looking for a new bass player until two months ago. We worked on ourselves, identified... what part can we work on, so when someone else steps in, it's clean. They're not stepping in our shit, you know? HETFIELD: All right, thinking about bass players, finally. So... we're gonna need a fourth member. You know, we know you're a great bass player. It's the vibe, you know. We need to make sure... TOWLE: Jason kind of triggered this whole thing a couple of years ago and, urn... I can't believe it's been two years, you know? And then we've gone through some... ULRICH: We realized that we kind of wanted somebody who was, like, our age; somebody who had been around the block a couple times. Right, right. We've-we've grown a lot, man. These three guys in this band. Urn... ULRICH: And last time, when we did this 14, 15 years ago... Uh-huh. 16 years ago, I guess it was, we literally sat down and... started auditioning bass players, you know, the day after the funeral Mmm. For Cliff, so now it's 16 years later, different circumstances. When Jason left, he took his basses with him. You want four or five? Uh, whatever. What-what five-strings do you have?

L-I had a vision of us jamming with him the last hour. L-I guess I just feel this is kind of, like, weird to keep, like, just doing our own thing. It just feels not welcoming. This morning, I heard him say he was pretty comfortable. (all talking at once) It's not about what he says. It's about what I feel. HETFIELD: All right. ULRICH: Are we cool, James? Yeah. I-l guess the only other thing I'd like to say is, you know, when we leave this up to just how we're feeling, a lot of it depends on how you're feeling. You know, when you say those things.

II' II' ULRICH: Cliff... it was just, like, you saw Cliff, and me and James went, "He's in our band, there's no question." He hit it out of the park. And that's where it sort of gets interesting. Because if Cliff Burton showed up today, maybe he wouldn't be the guy, either. HETFIELD: I mean, the three guys that I like all have unique features that I would love to Frankenstein, you know?

Yeah. or something like that. And you don't feel that with this guy at all. It's like, the last three songs... Like, "Sanitarium," "Nothing Else Matters," and... What was... There was some, uh... HAMMETT: Uh... HETFIELD: "Sad But True." "Sad But True." I mean, they were flawless. I looked over at him during "Whiplash" and he was just right in the pocket and in there.

Here's money up front. Mm-hmm. To get you kicked in and inspired. Right. And this is a reality, this is my future. This is what life can hold for me... Wow. With my new family. Ooh.

(clears throat) Uh, you know, when I heard that you guys were moving here and all of that, that brought up a lot of fear around, "Wow, what is Phil's perception of, you know, his, you know, longevity with Metallica?"

I've tried to make it clear that... that, urn, we're selling... I think pe... uh, we've told people we're selling our house in Kansas City, but that doesn't mean we're moving here. Okay? And we won't likely move to San Francisco if... if there's not a future out there with Metallica, 'cause it you know, that's my... I want to make sure that the... the bass player's intact, I want to be sure that the tour's on, and I-And I also, as I said, have performance coach visions for each of you and for the band. And I... to me, the work isn't over. Urn, I'd like us to honor what we had, and... if you want to be away from... you know, on your own or something, for the couple months that... Right. You're heading back in June, then that's... (chair scrapes) Then that's... Keep going back. Okay. I got... I don't know, I guess I have a problem sometimes, Phil, with the "let's see how it works out, let's see how it happens." And then, "No, let's honor what happened, you know, six months ago," you know? That-That's kind of strange to me, you know? Because I think that you use those things when they're convenient at times, you know? Personal stuff or business things and... I-I don't know, I don't know, they're... the boundaries are... I don't know, becoming more clear to me. Urn... There's-There's that element of-of... trust that just kind of floats with you, with me. And I... And that... I-I'm really sorry about that. That-That. .. you know. L-I been up... swimming uphill on that one for a long time with you, and I'd like... I'd like for us to be able to resolve it. But maybe we can't. ULRICH: I've got to tell you that I... You know, if the client-- either James or us-- says... You know, then... I-I really think that needs to be respected without... you know, just, you know, the old "turn the knife" thing in there. You know, it just... it-it... you know, if the client says, you know, "Time out for a while"-- time out. Yeah, I... That is great. Although, with our process, to honor what we usually do, we take... But then it should be put on the table but left on the table. And should be able to walk away without what you're saying right now, which is now there are trust issues and stuff. I don't know how to separate... separate out In its simplest form. I ju... l-l think it's a conflict of interest that you tell him that he needs you around more. If he has... If he wants to take a break. No, no, no, no, no . I'm not saying that. I'm saying... I just... I see that as a conflict of interest. Look, I am saying you guys have made a decision. It's okay for me to say I'm-I'm not happy with that decision. The premise is you guys don't need me. And-And I... I'm good with that. Anyway, you're going... it's, uh... Anyway... let's jam. Great, I'll see you guys. I'm taking off. I'll see you, uh... next week. Have a good one.

II' (cheering, whistling) PATERNO: "Your voting interests will equal "your percentage interest in the new Metallica account, "while each of our voting interests will be one-third of the difference between 100% and your percentage." This is about as lawyer as you get. But it's really... Sort of.. laying out... PATERNO: Yeah, it lays out the deal, okay, so... For instance, in the first period, you have five percent, okay? TRUJILLO: Uh-huh. PATERNO: So when we do a vote, you get 32 votes, you get 32 votes, you get 32 votes, you get five votes. In any vote, okay? ULRICH: But this doesn't mean anything. HETFIELD: I think it's crap. I mean, I-l... ULRICH: I think in the, in the spirit of what we're trying to do, we've gotta do 25, and then Q-Prime's the tie-breaker, that's... PATERNO: That works, that's fine. That's cool. II' (audience cheering wildly) What's up? II' PATERNO: Now here it also says you will not be required to fund any losses in the new Metallica account, but we will be entitled to recover any losses out of future profits. For instance, buying the-the, uh... documentary, it's not your problem. If the documentary loses money and the company never makes any more money again, it's these three guys' problem. ULRICH: Yeah. (all laughing) Well, shit. "What'd you do with your money?" I went and bought a new car, I bought my mom a house, and we went and bought a documentary. It was great. (all laugh) You know, it was just... trying to keep in the spirit of this whole thing... II' BURNSTEIN: By the end of this week, we're going to have an album title. You could say, in three days, we're not going to have to agonize about this anymore. HETFIELD: Well, the thing that stood out to me was St. Anger, there's... it's strong. I mean, there's iconic strong, you know? HAMMETT: Yeah, I agree. I hear you. L-I, I like that title quite a bit. It's so easy just to say "June 17th is St. Anger's Day." Yeah, no, it's true, that's cool. You know? I mean, it's... ULRICH: I think "Frantic" is a better album title. I think that's... I don't know. ...It's more about the record. HAMMETT: But St. Anger's a good... REITER: It's an original statement. It's an original statement. St. Anger, St. Anger. HETFIELD: Well, this is an angry record... Right. ...but you read the lyrics, it's angry in a healthy way. Right. Yeah, this is also a frantic record. Getting stuff out. BURNSTEIN: Frantic is more like, they're trying things that they don't, they don't... they're not exactly sure of. They don't know what they're doing. They're trying to climb back up the... the mountain again. MENSCH: Right. They're not sure of themselves. I mean, we don't have to take it... I mean, that's a fair... I mean hello, uh, that's a fair thing. I mean, if you think that "Frantic" has a negative connotation to it, I never thought of it like that. If it's St. Anger, they're going to form an image of "These guys are angry, I know it. "They're angry about Napster, they're angry about "the new stuff that's coming in, "they're angry about their lives. I'm angry, too. I get it." II' REITER: I think you guys know the idea about trying to shoot a video in San Quentin. HETFIELD: Wow. ROCK". So let me get this straight: you're going to go to a maximum security prison and Metallica's going to play "St. Anger" really loud. HAMMETT: Yeah! ♪ St. Anger 'round my neck ♪ ♪ St. Anger 'round my neck ♪ ♪ He never gets respect ♪ ♪ St. Anger ♪ ♪ 'Round my neck ♪ I've been asked to come out here and talk a little bit about, uh, what this song means to us. Anger's an emotion that I've-I've struggled with for pretty much all my life. ♪ St. Anger ♪ ♪ You flush it out ♪ ♪ 'Round my neck ♪ ♪ You flush it out, you flush it out a' ♪ He never gets respect ♪ HETFIELD: There's a lot of misspent anger that has come out sideways for a lot of people. Including yourselves. And if I hadn't have had music in my life, it's quite possible I could be in here or not even in here, be dead. And, uh, I'd, uh... I'd much rather be alive. ♪ Madly in anger with you ♪ ♪ I'm madly in anger ♪ ♪ With you, I'm madly in anger ♪ M With you r ♪ I'm madly in anger with you ♪ I'm pretty nervous up here. Don't really know what to say; I'm just trying to share some of what's going on for me-- I'm not here to sell nothin', that's for damn sure. Urn... (inmates cheering) Everyone is born good. Everyone's got the same size soul, and we're here to connect with that, so we're very proud to be in your house and play some music for you. Thanks. (cheering, whistling, applause) HETFIELD: More than any other record-- I don't know if you guys feel that-- but, for me, this is, like, a product of what we're just doing hanging out, you know what I mean? It's like... HAMMET". It's almost like a diary. Yeah, a diary. It's like, "Here's our memories on CD, you know?" ULRICH: It's like we've proven that you can make aggressive music without negative energy. Yeah. Okay, and I don't think anybody ever thought that that would be possible. Do you know what I mean? Right. You can make something that's aggressive and fucked up, okay? With positive energy between the people creating it. HETFIELD: Yeah. It hit me, you know? This... project's coming to an end and, I don't know, I think I'm kind of bummed about that. I'm kind of just... kind of liking the schedule that happens or the safeness in that. Coming here, being able to talk, creating, you know? And... And, uh... I don't know. I've been kind of... coming down from this for about the past month. I mean, getting up at 5:00 in the morning and just... pacing my apartment. Just not really knowing what the hell I'm doing either. So I'm with you. Like, I don't want to let you go home. I mean, man, I don't know. ROCK: (chuckles) I really appreciate that. That's really nice of you to say. HETFIELD: I don't know. I could feel myself kind of protecting myself with some depression or something, wanting to just kind of isolate. And I don't want to do that. I want to feel the sadness of... I mean, I-l didn't feel depressed, I felt sad. That's when I knew it was something different than just me... my old stuff, you know? I mean, there is some of that, but... (chuckles) Sadness and depression-- I guess I don't really know the difference. And, Phil, all the stuff that you've brought here to, like... You've set out all the tools, you know? And you allowed us to build what we've built, you know? With guidance. I really appreciate your bringing... your bringing this forward. And there is a difference between sadness and depression. Clearly. (sighs) This is the hugest chapter in my life.
