Subs by Dr. B Kevin: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN WITH MY LIFE. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] [ CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING ] Man: ELMO! ELMO! ALL RIGHT ALREADY! YOU PEOPLE ARE CRAZY! Kevin: HE HAS BEEN SO UNBELIEVABLY HUGE. HI, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOOK AT ELMO, MOM. ELMO TO A 6-YEAR-OLD IS LIKE BRAD PITT. [ LAUGHS ] [ SQUEALS ] ELMO IS JUST BUBBLY AND DANCING, AND KEVIN COMES ALIVE THROUGH ELMO. Kevin: IT'S HARD WHEN YOU ARE A PRIVATE PERSON. IT'S VERY NERVE-RACKING TO ACT AS MYSELF. ABSOLUTELY HE IS MOST COMFORTABLE IN HIS SKIN WHEN HE IS ELMO. Robinson: I'VE SEEN OUTTAKES... CHEESE. ...STUPID. STOP IT! ...WHERE KEVIN WILL BE BITING PEOPLE AND HITTING PEOPLE AND BEING A LITTLE SON OF A GUN. YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?! YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?! YES. [ LAUGHS ] ELMO! WHAT?! YOU WANT A PIECE OF ELMO?! IT MAY BE PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME TO SAY THAT THAT'S ELMO. IT CERTAINLY IS KEVIN. [ HORN HONKS ] Cooney: IT'S AMAZING TO THINK THAT THAT BIG A STAR IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE STREET. Kevin: WHEN I WAS 9 YEARS OLD, IT WAS JUST A DREAM THAT I HAD. "WOW, I WISH THAT I COULD WORK WITH THE MUPPETS." KEVIN'S A BRILLIANT PERFORMER, BRILLIANT IN PART BECAUSE OF THE SAME REASON WE WERE ALL BRILLIANT. IT'S BECAUSE OF JIM. [ APPLAUSE ] WHAT ABOUT JIM HENSON? WHAT? WHAT PART HAS HE EVER PLAYED IN YOUR SUCCESS? THIS IS TOO DEEP. IT'S SORT OF -- IT'S SORT OF LIKE RELIGION. IT'S LIKE ANOTHER BEING. IT'S LIKE SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE OF YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] Elmo: HELLO! [ LAUGHS ] IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. Robinson: WHEN A PUPPET IS TRUE AND GOOD AND MEANINGFUL, IT'S THE SOUL OF THE PUPPETEER THAT YOU'RE SEEING. THIS IS THE HOUSE. BACK IN THOSE WINDOWS, NENE, PAM, GEORGIE, AND I -- WE ALL LIVED IN THAT ROOM RIGHT BACK THERE. TURNERS STATION -- THEY CALLED IT "CHOCOLATE CITY." IT WAS AWAY FROM BALTIMORE CITY, DOWN IN THE COUNTY. IT WAS A SMALL COMMUNITY, SO EVERYBODY KNEW EACH OTHER. AND SEE? ALL THIS WATER BACK HERE CONNECTS TO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY. AND RAYMOND METAL'S WHERE MY FATHER WORKED, JUST OVER ACROSS THE WATER. SEE, ONCE THEY BUILT ALL THESE FACTORIES BACK HERE, THE WATER BECAME POLLUTED, AND SO INSTEAD OF BEACH, IT WAS ALL JUST DEAD FISH AND CRABS AND EVERYTHING, AND IT JUST STUNK LIKE CRAZY. YOU KNOW, I JUST LOVED WATCHING "THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY." I REMEMBER TINKER BELL WOULD HIT, AND THEN IT WOULD GO INTO THIS WONDERFUL WORLD. AND I WANTED TO LIVE AT DISNEY WORLD. I TOOK CONSTRUCTION PAPER AND WROTE "I WANT TO GO TO DISNEY WORLD. I WANT TO GO TO DISNEY WORLD. I WANT TO GO TO DISNEY WORLD." I PUT A CARD IN OUR BEDROOM, IN MY MOM AND DAD'S BEDROOM, IN THE KITCHEN, IN THE LIVING ROOM, ANYWHERE THAT ANYBODY WOULD STEP FOOT, IN THE BATHROOM, THINKING THAT THAT WOULD GET ME THERE. IT DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THAT. Narrator: KEVIN LOVED WATCHING TELEVISION, ESPECIALLY THE SHOW THAT CAME ON EVERY WEEKDAY AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING, "CAPTAIN KANGAROO." [ "PUFFIN' BILLY" PLAYS ] Kevin: "CAPTAIN" WAS A MAGICAL PLACE, AS OPPOSED TO...THE TYPE OF PLACE THAT I LIVED AND THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT I SAW. Narrator: ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 10, 1969, THE FLEDGLING PUBLIC BROADCASTING SYSTEM AIRED A NEW EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM. ♪ SUNNY DAYS SWEEPIN' THE CLOUDS AWAY ♪ ♪ ON MY WAY TO WHERE THE AIR IS SWEET ♪ ♪ CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET, HOW TO GET TO SESAME STREET? ♪ SALLY, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A STREET LIKE SESAME STREET. EVERYTHING HAPPENS HERE. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT. Kevin: JUST AS SOON AS IT CAME ON, I WAS GLUED. THAT WAS IT. IT WAS MORE LIKE MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE WAS BLACKS AND WHITES AND ASIANS AND LATINOS. HI, MR. HOOPER. ♪ BA-DUMP-A-DUMP-A-DUMP ♪ ♪ DEE-DEE-DOO-DEE-DOO ♪ Kevin: THEN I SAW THE MUPPETS. HEY, ERNIE, ERNIE, HEY, THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT. LOOK AT ALL THE DECORATIONS. YEAH. DOESN'T IT LOOK NICE, BERT? YEAH. WHAT ARE THE DECORATIONS FOR, ERNIE? ERNIE LOOKED RIGHT IN THE CAMERA AND SAID, "HEY, BERT, COME HERE. THERE'S SOMEONE SPECIAL I WANT YOU TO MEET." A SPECIAL VISITOR? YEP. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO IT IS? OH, YEAH, YEAH. WHO IS IT? WHERE? OKAY, WELL, IT'S A VERY SPECIAL VISITOR. AND THAT'S WHY I'VE DECORATED THE WHOLE PLACE UP. YEAH? TAKE A LOOK. WHERE? LOOK RIGHT -- LOOK RIGHT IN THERE, BERT. IN THERE? SEE RIGHT IN THERE? YEAH, LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER. SEE WHO IT IS? YEAH. SEE? SEE, BERT? OH, YEAH. W-WELL, HI. "WHAT? WHO, ME? YOU'RE TALKING TO ME?" BOY, I SURE AM GLAD IT'S YOU. UNBELIEVABLE. I MEAN, I WAS JUST MAGNETIZED TO THESE CHARACTERS -- BIG BIRD... OSCAR... AND MY FAVORITE, GROVER. AND I WAS LIKE, "WOW. HOW ARE THOSE PUPPETS MADE? WELL, HOW DO THEY DO THAT?" AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, WHO IS DOING THIS? WHO IS CREATING THIS?" HELLO, THERE. MY NAME IS JIM HENSON, AND I'M A PUPPETEER. I'M CALLED A PUPPETEER BECAUSE I WORK WITH PUPPETS. THEN I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT JIM WAS DOING. WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU GO ABOUT MAKING VERY SIMPLE PUPPETS. ANYTIME I HEARD OF A SPECIAL THAT WAS COMING ON WITH JIM, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE I WOULD WATCH IT. MAKE THE SOCK WORK A LITTLE MORE. I PUT A RUBBER BAND AROUND THERE. DOES THAT HURT? [ Deep voice ] NO, IT DOESN'T HURT AT ALL. OF COURSE NOT. THERE. NOW I CAN ALMOST ALL THE WAY SEE IT. SON OF A GUN. "WOW. LOOK AT ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT HE'S DOING." THIS IS DON SAHLIN, WHO IS OUR MUPPET BUILDER. "WOULDN'T I LOVE TO BE A PART OF THAT?" THIS IS FRANK OZ. HELLO. HE'S A PUPPETEER, ALSO. "THIS IS WHO I WOULD LIKE TO BE." TAKE OFF MY MUSTACHE. AH! TAKE OFF MY BEARD. OOH! THERE GOES MY NOSE. AND THEN WE MOVE HIS EYES UP ABOVE HERE. Kevin: ONE DAY, I GOT THIS URGE. I SAW MY DAD'S TRENCH COAT. INSIDE, THERE WAS THIS BLACK FUR. I THOUGHT, "WOW, THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT MONKEY." I JUST WENT OFF. I WAS ENTRANCED. I CUT IT UP, AND I MADE THIS PUPPET CALLED MOANDY. I PUT THE PUPPET IN MY MOM AND DAD'S DRESSER. THAT'S WHEN I STARTED GETTING REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HE WOULD DO TO ME, SO I HID. WHEN I HEARD MY NAME, I WAS LIKE, "OH, NO. HERE IT COMES." HE SAID, "WHAT'S HIS NAME?" AND I SAID "MOANDY." THE NEXT THING HE SAID WAS, "NEXT TIME, JUST ASK." I WAS LIKE, "PHEW!" Gladys: I WAS SO THRILLED WITH WHAT HE DID. FORGET THE COAT. [ LAUGHS ] KEVIN GONNA MAKE MONEY. HE CAN BUY HIM ANOTHER COAT. [ LAUGHS ] KEVIN GONNA BUY HIM ANOTHER COAT. I WAS SO THRILLED, I HAD -- THAT COAT -- I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I WAS SHOCKED. I WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKED. Kevin: MY MOM HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF KIDS THAT SHE WAS BABYSITTING. MY FATHER HELPED ME BUILD A PUPPET STAGE, SO I WOULD SET THAT UP IN THE BACKYARD, AND THEN THE KIDS THAT MY MOM WOULD WATCH, AND THE KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD COME AND WATCH THE SHOW. THIS IS WHERE -- WE KEPT -- MY MOM WOULD PUT THE CLOTHES AT, CLOTHESLINE AT, AND THAT WAS WHERE I HAD MY FIRST PUPPET SHOW. I WOULD THROW THE BLANKET OVER THIS, AND THEN MY MOM'S DAYCARE KIDS WOULD COME OUT HERE AND WATCH ME DO THE SHOW. I STARTED DOING LIVE SHOWS AROUND THE BALTIMORE AREA. Narrator: HE HELD A BENEFIT FOR A CHILD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED IN AN ACCIDENT. AT A LOCAL CLINIC, HE PERFORMED FOR CHILDREN WHO WERE BLIND. AND HE SOON DISCOVERED HE HAD A GIFT FOR BRINGING SMILES TO THE FACES OF CHILDREN WHO NEEDED IT MOST. SO, ARE YOU READY FOR A SHOW? YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. I SAID, "ARE YOU READY FOR A SHOW?" YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! Kevin: NORMALLY, I'D GO TO VARIOUS SCHOOLS ALL AROUND THE BALTIMORE AREA, AND THIS ONE WAS A HANDICAPPED SCHOOL. THEY'RE A REALLY PLEASING AUDIENCE. THEY TEND TO REALLY ENJOY THE THINGS THAT I'M PUTTING TO THEM. Puppet: MS. CICELY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] COME OVER HERE, STEVEN. COME ON. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. COME ON, COME ON. OOH! YOU LIKE ME? YES. I LIKE YOU, TOO. 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? WHY? I SEEN YOU BEFORE. YOU SEEN ME BEFORE? I'M TALKING TO YOU, NOT HIM. OH! YOU TALKING TO THE PERSON THAT'S WORKING ME, HUH? YEAH. YOUR VOICE IS COMING THROUGH HIM. FROM WHERE? YEAH. OH! DO YOU REALLY LIKE ME? YEAH. GIVE ME A HUG. I SEEN YOU BEFORE. OH. BUT GIVE ME A HUG. Kevin: WHEN I SEE SOMEONE LIKE STEVEN LAUGHING AT THE CHARACTER THAT I MADE, IT REALLY GIVES ME A GOOD FEELING AND MAKES ME FEEL TERRIFIC. I GOT TO GO, OKAY? BUT I'LL BE BACK. OKAY. OKAY, BYE. BYE. BYE. Narrator: BUT TO SOME PEOPLE, KEVIN'S WORK DIDN'T SEEM SO SPECIAL. I LOVED BARBIES, AND I FELT LIKE MY MOM DIDN'T TREAT MY BARBIES LIKE SHE DID HIS PUPPETS. GEORGE AND ANITA, THEY WOULD THROW THEM AROUND. Kevin: SHE THREW ALL MY PUPPETS OUT THE WINDOW, SO I THREW ALL OF HER COSMETICS OUT THE WINDOW. AND THERE HAPPENED TO BE SNOW OUTSIDE. AND THERE WAS STARTING TO BE SOME CRITICISM FROM KIDS TEASING ME IN SCHOOL. HE HAD GUYS THAT WOULD PICK ON HIM, SAID HE WAS PLAYING WITH DOLLS. Anita: SOME ADULTS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, "WELL, WHY ISN'T HE PLAYING BASKETBALL OUT?" A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID, "WELL, HE SHOULD BE PLAYING OUTSIDE." I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THAT. I KNEW IT WAS A TALENT HE HAD, AND HE LOVED IT. George Jr.: HE FACED A LOT OF OPPOSITION, BUT HE JUST STUCK WITH HIS DREAM, AND HE WENT FOR, YOU KNOW, WHAT HE TRULY BELIEVED IN HIS HEART. Narrator: WHILE PERFORMING AT A NEARBY COUNTY FAIR, KEVIN WAS SPOTTED BY A LOCAL TELEVISION PERSONALITY, STU KERR, WHO SUGGESTED THAT HE COME UP TO CHANNEL 2 AND TRY OUT FOR A NEW CHILDREN'S PROGRAM. ON THE DAY OF THE AUDITION, THE CLASH HOUSEHOLD WAS BUSTLING WITH ACTIVITY. I GOT KEVIN FIXED UP IN HIS ROOM. WE GOT HIM THIS LITTLE CORDUROY -- THEY WERE WEARING THESE HIPSTER JACKETS WITH THE PANTS. IT WAS BEIGE CORDUROY, A DARK-BROWN TURTLENECK, AND I GOT HIM DARK-BROWN HUSH PUPPIES. Narrator: BALTIMORE'S CHANNEL 2 IS ONE OF THE OLDEST TELEVISION STATIONS ON THE EAST COAST. FROM HERE, STU KERR'S PROGRAMS WERE BEAMED TO THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN EVERY AFTERNOON. KEVIN WAS AUDITIONING FOR A NEW SHOW THAT STU WAS CREATING CALLED "CABOOSE." Kevin: THIS WAS MY FIRST TELEVISION STUDIO. I SAW CAMERAS, AND THERE WAS A STAGE, YOU KNOW, WITH ALL THESE LIGHTS. RECORD. I WAS STILL VERY SHY AT THE TIME. 5...4...3...2...1. FADE UP EFFECTS. CUE STU. IT WAS KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE. [ MUMBLES ] OH, HI. WE'RE JUST, UH -- WE'RE JUST CHECKING OFF THE LIST HERE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D BETTER PACK. YOU KNOW, I REALLY JUST WANTED TO GET UP THERE AND HAVE A GOOD TIME. HA! WE'RE GOING ON A P-I-C-N-I-K-I-N-I. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT THE HOT DOGS. HOT DOGS! CHECK! MAYONNAISE! CHECK! Kevin: AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THAT WAS FINE. LET'S TRY ONE MORE TAKE. STU SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS WITH ME." I REMEMBER THIS TINGLING SENSATION. Puppet: YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] Kevin: "I'M GONNA GET TO DO THIS." RIGHT NOW I HAVE 85 PUPPETS. THE WAY I GET MY IDEAS FOR MY PUPPETS IS THEY'LL JUST COME UP IN MY HEAD, AND THEN I'LL TRY DIFFERENT VOICES AND PRACTICE AND PRACTICE UNTIL I GET IT. [ Kid's voice ] HI. [ Normal voice ] HI. [ High-pitched voice ] HI. [ Excited voice ] HI. [ Deep voice ] HI. HOW YA DOING? Ziemann: HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. [ High-pitched voice ] HI. MY NAME IS PUCKY. HOW MANY KIDS WENT OUT AND BUILT THEIR OWN PUPPETS, NOT JUST A HAND PUPPET, BUT A COMPLETE MUPPET THAT WORKED? YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS HAD WHAT I CALL CENTRAL CASTING OF PUPPETS. [ LAUGHS ] YOU KNOW, AND YOU WOULD MAKE THE PUPPETS LOOK LIKE THE CREW MEMBERS. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU MADE ONE THAT LOOKED LIKE ME. [ LAUGHS ] OH, MY GOODNESS! [ LAUGHS ] LOOK AT THAT NOSE. LOOK AT THAT NOSE. THE NOSE, THE NOSE. LOOK AT THAT NOSE. I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. LOOK AT THAT PROFILE. YEAH, YEAH. AND YOU KEPT THIS. AND SEE... OH, MY GOODNESS. I USED TO SEW THESE MOUTHS IN. SEE? I USED THE WRONG COLOR. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PEACH. BUT THREAD COST A LOT BACK THEN. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. LOOK AT THE STITCHES. BOY. I'M GLAD I'M BETTER NOW. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: EVERY SATURDAY AT 12:30 IN THE AFTERNOON, TELEVISIONS IN KEVIN'S NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD TUNE TO CHANNEL 2. THOSE SAME KIDS IN SCHOOL WERE COMING UP AND SAYING, "SO, HOW'S STU KERR?" IT WASN'T ABOUT "YOU SLEEP WITH YOUR PUPPETS." Narrator: THAT YEAR, THE DUNDALK SENIOR-HIGH YEARBOOK FEATURED A SURPRISING PHOTOGRAPH. Gladys: THEY GOT HIM STANDING BY A ROLLS-ROYCE, RIGHT, AND HE'S GOT A CASHMERE BLACK COAT ON AND A CAP AND SUNGLASSES, AND THEY GOT HIM THE MOST LIKELY...TO BE A MILLIONAIRE. Narrator: FOR KEVIN, TELEVISION WAS NO LONGER JUST ENTERTAINMENT. IT WAS RESEARCH. Kevin: IF I COULD HAVE CLIMBED IN, ACTUALLY BE ON THE SET OF "SESAME STREET," I WOULD HAVE TRIED IT. Narrator: IN 1976, HENSON BROUGHT HIS MUPPETS TO PRIME TIME WITH "THE MUPPET SHOW." Kevin: OF COURSE, I WAS THE CLOSEST ONE TO THE TV WATCHING. Narrator: BROADCAST IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES, IT BECAME THE MOST POPULAR TELEVISION SHOW IN THE WORLD. THEY COULD DO NO WRONG. THEY JUST COULDN'T. I MEAN, ANYTHING THAT JIM TOUCHED TURNED TO GOLD. Narrator: HENSON'S CLOSEST PARTNER WAS FRANK OZ. Kevin: IT WAS AMAZING TO ME TO WATCH JIM AND FRANK PERFORM ERNIE AND BERT IN THE MORNING AND THEN WATCH THEM PERFORM KERMIT AND MISS PIGGY AT NIGHT. NOW I'M GLUED TO THE TELEVISION TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THOSE PUPPETS WERE BUILT. I WAS STILL PRAYING THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS, I'LL LEARN HOW TO MAKE A PUPPET LIKE THE MUPPETS. I STILL DIDN'T HAVE IT JUST RIGHT. YOU SAW THE SEAMS. YOU KNOW, AND WITH THE MUPPETS, YOU NEVER SAW THE SEAMS. IT STUMPED ME. MY MOM WOULD SAY, "YOU KNOW, LISTEN. YOU HAVE GOT TO MOVE BACK. YOU'RE GONNA GO BLIND." [ FUNKY MUSIC PLAYS ] Narrator: ON TELEVISION ONE AFTERNOON, KEVIN CAME ACROSS A PROGRAM ABOUT A MAN WHO DESIGNED MANY OF JIM HENSON'S MOST FAMOUS PUPPETS. HIS NAME WAS KERMIT LOVE, SEEN HERE ON "THE DICK CAVETT SHOW." [ APPLAUSE ] KERMIT HAS DONE ALL OF OUR BIG CHARACTERS. HE DID THE BODY OF BIG BIRD AND THOG AND THE GREAT BIG FEATHER GUY HERE, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, A GREAT ENGINEERING THING. DID ANY OF THIS -- DID YOU HAVE TO STUDY ENGINEERING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS? NO. WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND? JUST HAVE TO STUDY JIM'S CONCEPTS. YOU DO? IT'S AN AMAZING THING. WELL, IT WAS GREAT FUN. Kevin: I WAS SO INSPIRED, I SAID TO MY MOM, YOU KNOW, AFTER IT WENT OFF, "I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO TRY TO GET AHOLD OF KERMIT LOVE." MY MOM DIALING THE PHONE, I MEAN, WHICH WAS AMAZING TO ME. Gladys: I CALLED KERMIT. "HELLO." HE SAID, "WHO IS THIS THAT'S SO ANXIOUS TO MEET ME?" I SAID, "WELL, IT'S MY SON." I SAID, "HE'S INTO PUPPETRY," AND I SAID, "HE WOULD LOVE TO MEET YOU." Kevin: LO AND BEHOLD, HE SAID, "WHENEVER WE'RE IN TOWN, COME AND VISIT." Narrator: KEVIN'S FAMILY COULDN'T AFFORD TO SEND HIM AWAY, BUT IN HIS SENIOR YEAR, AN OPPORTUNITY CAME UP. HIS CLASS WAS TAKING A TRIP TO NEW YORK CITY. Kevin: I REMEMBER GETTING ON THE TRAIN, SO EXCITED, I WAS HUMMING "NEW YORK, NEW YORK" THEME, WATCHING THE SKYLINE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER. MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS "MAN, IT'S REALLY ENORMOUS." [ SIREN WAILING, HORN HONKS ] ALL OF US JUST LOSING OUR MINDS. NOW I'M BREAKING AWAY FROM THEM TO GO TO KERMIT'S WORKSHOP BY MYSELF. I WAS TAKING THE SUBWAY. TO ACTUALLY GO ALONE WAS NERVE-RACKING. BOY, I'LL TELL YOU, ON THE SUBWAY, JUST THINKING OF ALL THE THINGS I MIGHT GET TO SEE -- "WHAT ARE THEY WORKING ON RIGHT NOW? "MAYBE I'LL GET TO LEARN THOSE SECRETS THAT I COULDN'T FIND OUT THROUGH WATCHING THE SHOW." AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, STANDING AT GREAT JONES AND BUZZING THE BUZZER, AND THEN HERE IS KERMIT LOVE, WHO LOOKS LIKE SANTA CLAUS. KEVIN! GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW YOU DOING, KERMIT? GOOD TO SEE YOU. MADE IT ALL THE WAY UP FROM BALTIMORE, HEY? "KEV FROM BALTIMORE," HE SAID, "COME ON IN!" WHO IS THIS? OH, THIS IS PUCKY. PUCKY? YEAH. OH. LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN AROUND THE RINK A COUPLE OF TIMES. KERMIT JUST TOOK ME IN LIKE HE KNEW ME FOR A LONG TIME, AND HE SHOWED ME EVERYTHING HE KNEW. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. OKAY. AND LET'S GO IN. HE TOOK ME AROUND, AND ALL THIS MAGIC WAS HAPPENING THERE. I MET THESE TALENTED BUILDERS THAT HE HAD AT HIS SHOP, AND I COULD ASK THEM A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING. "WHERE DO THEY GET THE EYES? "YOU KNOW, DO THEY MAKE THEM FROM SCRATCH? "CAN YOU BUY? "YOU KNOW, THE COLORS ARE SO BRILLIANT, THE FUR. "I CAN'T GET THAT TYPE OF FUR IN BALTIMORE. WHERE DO YOU GET THAT?" I MEAN, ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO FINALLY GETTING THEM ANSWERED. THIS PLACE IS ALWAYS SO COOL. NOW I GET TO GO TO THE MUPPET WORKSHOP, WHERE THEY BUILD ALL OF THE OTHER "SESAME STREET" CHARACTERS. EVERYTHING IS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS. FUR OVER HERE AND FOAM OVER THERE. EYES. YOU PULL OUT THESE LONG, BIG DRAWERS, AND IN THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EYES, ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF EYES WITH LIDS, NO LIDS, THE EYELASHES, YOU KNOW, SMALL PUPILS, BIG PUPILS. THEN YOU CAN OPEN ANOTHER DRAWER, AND IT'S DIFFERENT-SIZED NOSES AND DIFFERENT-COLOR NOSES. AND THE SAME THING WITH HAIR, TEETH. [ LAUGHS ] Man: MUSTACHES, BEARDS, GOATEES. [ LAUGHS ] THERE'S ONE. THAT'S A GREAT ONE. IT WAS JUST AMAZING. I KNEW WHEN I GOT IN THERE THAT THIS IS THE TYPE OF WORKSHOP I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE. OH, MY GOD. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S WONDERFUL. OH, IT'S WONDERFUL, ROLLIE. I JUST HAPPENED TO BE AT THE SHOP WHEN ROLLIE, WHO IS A PHENOMENAL BUILDER -- SHE'S BEEN THERE FROM THE BEGINNING OF "THE MUPPET SHOW." SEE? I'M GETTING RED RIGHT THERE. OH, YEAH. OKAY, SURE. YEAH. I CAN PUT A LITTLE BIT OF FLEECE, YEAH. FLEECE OR SOMETHING, YEAH. AND THEN IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I MEAN, IT'S JUST -- OH. OH, I SAW HER BUILDING NEW ERNIE AND BERTS. ROLLIE WAS A GENIUS AT IT. ERNIE HAS A TUBE. MM-HMM. AND WHAT'S THAT? COFFEE CAN. YEAH. COFFEE CAN? IS THAT WHAT IT IS?! YEAH! THAT'S WHY I'M FEELING THE RIDGES. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. IN KERMIT'S SHOP SO LONG AGO... [ GROANS ] BOY, YOU REALLY PUT IT IN TO STAY, DIDN'T YOU? ...HE EXPLAINED TO ME HOW THINGS WORK, HOW PUPPETS WORK, HOW MUPPETS WORK. GOOD, GOOD. YEAH, I THOUGHT... BUT LOOK. NOW WE HAVE A MOUTH THAT WORKS. IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SIT THERE, AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME HOW YOU CAN DO THE SEAM WHERE YOU DON'T SEE IT. IT WAS A TYPE OF MATERIAL THAT THEY WERE USING THAT I COULDN'T GET IN BALTIMORE CALLED FLEECE THAT ACTUALLY WAS MADE FOR THE ARMY. WE COVER IT WITH THIS FLEECING THAT IS A MARVELOUS MATERIAL, BECAUSE YOU CAN SEW IN RATHER INTERESTING SEAMS THAT DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY. Henson: THIS IS A KIND OF FABRIC THEY USE USUALLY TO MAKE THINGS LIKE BLANKETS AND SO FORTH. WE USE IT BECAUSE WHEN YOU MAKE A SEAM -- THAT MEANS WHEN YOU SEW TWO PIECES TOGETHER -- NOW, HERE'S A PUPPET RIGHT HERE THAT'S BEEN SEAMED RIGHT UP THE FRONT. YOU SEE? YOU CAN BARELY SEE IT ON TELEVISION, BUT THAT'S A SEAM RIGHT THERE. THERE'S ANOTHER SEAM RIGHT UNDER THE JAW THAT GOES STRAIGHT DOWN THROUGH THERE. I CALL THAT THE HENSON STITCH, 'CAUSE JIM DEVELOPED IT. [ LAUGHS ] THAT JIM HENSON STITCH. I FOUND OUT THAT THROUGH KERMIT. I'M 17 NOW. IT TOOK ME I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS TO FIND THAT OUT, BUT IT WAS WONDERFUL TO FIND OUT. I THINK WE OUGHT TO GIVE HER SOME PUPILS. THE FOCUS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE RIGHT. HE WAS REALLY...A WONDERFUL GRANDFATHER FIGURE. NOW PUT YOUR HAND IN AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. [ Woman's voice ] HELLO! AND NOW SHE'S TAKING ON QUITE A -- SHE... SHE. ...IS TAKING ON QUITE A PERSONALITY. KERMIT TOOK KEVIN MORE OR LESS LIKE A MOTHER HEN, YOU KNOW, HOW SHE KEEPS THE BABIES UNDER HER WINGS. HE JUST GATHERED KEVIN RIGHT IN AND TAUGHT HIM ALL THE THINGS THAT HE NEEDED TO KNOW. CICELY. SING IT. SING IT OUT. ♪ CICELY ♪ MY NAME IS... ♪ MY NAME IS CICELY ♪ LOVELY. LET ME SEE. DO YOUR VOWELS ONCE FOR ME. A-U-E! "U." OOH! OOH. SHE'S LISTENING TO YOU. [ LAUGHS ] NOW DO CICELY AND PROJECT IT FORWARD. ♪ CIC-E-LY ♪ THERE, THAT'S IT. AND UP. ♪ CICELY ♪ ♪ CICELY ♪ [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] NOW YOU'RE STIFFENING. I CAN SEE YOU STIFFENING. YES. LOOSEN IT UP. [ SPEAKS FRENCH ] [ LAUGHS ] [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] REMEMBER, THE VOICE COMES FROM BACK IN THE MOUTH. Narrator: IN PARIS, KEVIN IS TRAINING THE CAST OF THE FRENCH VERSION OF "SESAME STREET." WELL, ANOTHER THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO WITH HER ALL THE TIME IS GIVE HER A LITTLE SMILE. SEE, IF YOU KEEP THAT MOUTH OPEN JUST A LITTLE BIT, THERE'S A LITTLE SMILE, YOU KNOW? YEAH. AH. IF YOU DO THAT, THAT'S DEAD. SHE'S TOO SERIOUS. DEAD. SHE'S NOT HAPPY. YOU KNOW, BUT THAT'S... THAT'S CURIOUS. LISTENING, BUT STILL ALIVE. IT LOOKS EASY, BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A PIECE OF FABRIC WITH A FOAM HEAD REACT LIKE A HUMAN BEING WOULD. BUT KEVIN -- OH, MY GOSH -- HE'S BRILLIANT AT MANIPULATION. TRYING TO CREATE REALITY. YOU KNOW, WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A HUMAN. SO CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE DO WILL MAKE IT LOOK HUMAN. CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE DO, YOU KNOW, THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO DOESN'T, YOU KNOW. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT DOESN'T. IT'S MORE -- YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SHAKE OR WE LISTEN TO EACH OTHER, SAY, "AH." IT'S NOT... I THINK EVEN IF YOU CLOSE THE MOUTH, JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE PUPPET STAYS ALIVE. IT CAN'T JUST SIT THERE. IT HAS TO, YOU KNOW, LOOK AROUND AND KEEP ALIVE. [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] CHRISTOPHE, WHEN YOU DO A SCRATCH OF THE HEAD, TO SHOW LESS ROD, YOU BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN. THAT'S IT. BRING YOUR HEAD DOWN INTO THE FRAME. THEN THERE'S LESS ROD. OKAY. HE'S ALWAYS PLAYING ON CAMERA. HE'S ALWAYS SEEING "HOW -- HOW ELSE -- WHAT ELSE CAN I DO WITH THIS PUPPET?" I THINK I WAS ON THE SET THE DAY THAT KEVIN REALIZED THAT IF HE PUSHED HIS HAND IN A CERTAIN WAY AND PUSHED DOWN WITH HIS FINGERS, HE COULD MAKE ELMO'S -- THE TOP OF HIS HEAD KIND OF CAVE IN SO IT LOOKED LIKE ELMO'S EYES WERE LOOKING UP IN A FUNNY DIRECTION. WELL, THIS ONE IS DISGUSTING. AND THIS ONE IS "ELMO'S HUNGRY." [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S THE BEGGING LOOK. AND THIS ONE IS WHEN ELMO'S CONFUSED. "HUH? HUH?" [ LAUGHS ] Kevin: EVERYBODY UP. SEE IT WITH THE MUSIC. [ CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYS ] OKAY, STOP. SEE? YOU'RE DOING THIS. YOU'RE DOING THIS. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE FOCUS. REMEMBER, WE DID THAT IN REHEARSAL. AND YOU'RE NOT DOING IT AS MUCH WITH THE PUPPET. EVERYBODY, JUST COME DOWN AND WATCH MY HAND FOR A SECOND. WATCH JUST HOW COMFORTABLE IT LOOKS. [ CALYPSO MUSIC PLAYS ] [ MUPPETS SINGING IN FRENCH ] SEE? SEE HOW JUST COMFORTABLE THAT IS? FEEL IT. IF HE COULD TAKE HIS TALENT AND PUT IT IN YOUR ARM, IT WOULD BE THE DREAM. [ LAUGHS ] Kevin: YOU TOOK THESE? YES, YES, YES, YES. WHERE? IN NEW YORK? IN NEW YORK, YES. ARE YOU SERIOUS? [ LAUGHS ] THESE ARE WONDERFUL. LOOK AT THAT. AND DURING WHAT WAS A SHOOT OF -- IT WAS A PHONE, BUT -- HAD TO USE IT. IT WAS ON JULY OR AUGUST '69. THAT WAS RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF "SESAME STREET." I WAS 9. WHEN DID YOU START? I WAS 9. [ LAUGHS ] ONLY ONE TO GET THIS PICTURE. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I MET JIM HENSON. THAT WAS THE YEAR THAT THE MUPPET MOVIE CAME OUT. JIM PUT THE BUS FROM THE MUPPET MOVIE IN THE MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE, AND THAT MEANT THAT JIM AND FRANK WOULD BE ON THE BUS FOR THE MUPPET MOVIE, SO THEY NEEDED EXTRA PUPPETEERS FOR THE "SESAME STREET" FLOAT. KERMIT ASKED ME WOULD I LIKE TO BE ON IT. I JUST COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. IT JUST BLEW ME AWAY. I WAS SO EXCITED. Narrator: KEVIN WAS GIVEN ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED AND SILLIEST OF MUPPETS -- COOKIE MONSTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Kevin: THE "SESAME STREET" THEME STARTED, AND I HEARD A MAN YELL OUT, "'SESAME STREET,' JOIN THE PARADE!" THE FLOAT STARTED TO MOVE, AND EVERYBODY CHEERED. KERMIT TOLD US, "OKAY, YOU CAN PEEK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE." AND, MAN, I HAD NO IDEA. PEOPLE AND MORE PEOPLE AND MORE PEOPLE. IT IS MIND-BOGGLING. NOW I'M ON THIS FLOAT, AND I HAVE ONE OF THE MUPPETS, THE "SESAME STREET" MUPPETS, ON MY HAND, AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK AT IT TO SEE HOW THEY BUILT IT FOR SO MANY YEARS. OF COURSE, I TURNED IT INSIDE-OUT AND LOOKED IN IT, AND I SAW THAT JIM HENSON STITCH. AND THEN AFTER THE PARADE IS OVER, EVERYBODY GETS TO GO INSIDE OF MACY'S, AND THEY HAVE A BIG PARTY. ALL THE CELEBRITIES GO UP THERE. I WAS JUST THIS KID, AND I WAS, LIKE, TAKING IT ALL IN. AND THERE, ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM, WAS JIM HENSON. THAT SHYNESS CAME BACK, SO I WENT TO USE THE BATHROOM. AND LO AND BEHOLD, ONE OF THE MAIN MUPPETEERS, RICHARD HUNT, WAS THERE. AND HE SAID, "SO, YOU'RE HERE. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WORKING WITH KERMIT?" I SAID, "YEAH." HE SAID, "LISTEN. "YOU KNOW, JIM DOESN'T HAVE ANY BLACK PUPPETEERS, SO YOU NEED TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM WHAT YOU DO." SO I CAME OUT OF THE BATHROOM, SHAKING. KERMIT TOLD ME TO COME OVER, 'CAUSE HE WAS TALKING TO JIM. IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, MEETING SOMEBODY THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET AND NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D GET THE CHANCE TO. SO I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANY EYE CONTACT, AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS TRYING TO BE, YOU KNOW, AS... I REALLY WANTED TO COMMUNICATE WITH JIM AS MUCH AS RICHARD TOLD ME TO, BUT IT'S NOT IN MY NATURE. SO FORTUNATELY KERMIT WAS THERE TO HELP ME THROUGH. HE SAID, "LISTEN, JIM, THIS IS KEVIN CLASH." AND JIM LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, "CAN YOU STAY UP NEXT DAY?" IT WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOODNESS. THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE," KNOWING THAT I COULDN'T. BEFORE I COULD SAY YES, KERMIT SAID, "NO, KEVIN HAS TWO SHOWS LOCALLY IN BALTIMORE "THAT HE HAS TO GET BACK TO, BUT HE COULD SET UP AN APPOINTMENT, OR HE COULD SEND YOU SOMETHING." AND JIM SAID, "OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW, CAN YOU SEND ME A TAPE? YOU KNOW, AND WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE." AND BEFORE I COULD SAY YES [LAUGHS] KERMIT SAID, "YES, HE WILL." SO I WENT BACK DOWN TO BALTIMORE, AND I'M SO EXCITED, I RAN HOME. MY MOM AND DAD WAS IN THE KITCHEN. I WENT TO THEM, AND I SAID, "GUESS WHAT? I FINALLY MET JIM -- JIM HENSON." Narrator: KERMIT WASN'T THE ONLY ONE BRAGGING ABOUT KEVIN. STU KERR COULDN'T HELP BUT TELL HIS OLD FRIEND BOB KEESHAN ABOUT THE AMAZING YOUNG PUPPETEER HE DISCOVERED IN BALTIMORE. OH, DID I MENTION THAT BOB KEESHAN IS ALSO KNOWN AS CAPTAIN KANGAROO? Ziemann: NEXT THING YOU KNOW, STU SAYS, "WE NEED TO SET UP THE STUDIO FOR AN AUDITION TAPE." I SAID, "FOR WHO?" HE SAID, "KEVIN." AND I JUST LOOKED AT HIM. HE GOES, "DON'T START. JUST DON'T START." Kerr: THIS IS AN AUDITION FOR "CAPTAIN KANGAROO." COULD WE HAVE THE FIRST CONTESTANT, PLEASE? Narrator: FOR 18-YEAR-OLD KEVIN, IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RECORDING OF HIS LIFE. NO. HAVE YOU BEEN ON -- HAVE YOU BEEN ON TELEVISION BEFORE? UH, NO, NOT REALLY, NO. Kevin: STU WAS OFF-CAMERA, ASKING MY PUPPETS QUESTIONS. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? COULD YOU TURN THIS WAY, PLEASE? THAT'S IT. OH! OH, THERE YOU ARE. OH. HOW YOU -- GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN. UH, NO, I'M NOT CAPTAIN. I KNEW IF I LISTENED TO HIM, I'M GONNA DO THE BEST THAT I CAN. WHO'S NEXT, KEVIN? Kevin: FIEFER. LET'S SEE. OOH, LOOK AT FIEFER. HI, FIEF. HEY, FIEF. HI. [ LAUGHS ] DON'T BE AFRAID. WHY? I DON'T LIKE CAMERAS. OH, OH, LISTEN. [ SIGHS ] TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF, FIEFER. WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU? WE KNOW YOU'RE A LITTLE SHY. YEAH. WELL, UH, I'M A NICE PERSON. OH, ARE YOU? YEAH. I AM KIND OF SHY, BUT SOMETIMES I GET OVER IT, YOU KNOW? WELL, IT'S OVER NOW. YEAH. I SAY THE AUDITION IS OVER. OH, OH, THE AUDITION IS OVER? I THOUGHT -- I THOUGHT MY SHYNESS WAS -- NO, NO. OH. WELL, MAYBE THAT IS, TOO. YOU CAN LEAVE, BY THE WAY. OH, I CAN LEAVE? YES. OH, GREAT! YEAH. GOOD! OKAY, BYE! BYE. PHEW! I LOOKED AT STU, AND I SAID, "HE'S GONE. "HE'S GONE, AND YOU'RE TO BLAME, AND I'M TO BLAME FOR SHOOTING OUR BIG MOUTH OFF." Kevin: I GOT A CALL FROM CAPTAIN KANGAROO. ONE OF THE PRODUCERS AND THE HEAD WRITER CAME DOWN FROM NEW YORK TO BALTIMORE. AT THE TIME I BUILT ALL THESE PUPPETS, I'D GOTTEN THESE PLASTIC SHELVES, AND ALL OF THEM WERE IN MY MOM AND DAD'S BEDROOM, BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY SPACE. AND SO ALL OF THESE PUPPETS WERE ON THESE SHELVES. AND THEN LITERALLY GOING INTO MY MOM AND DAD'S BEDROOM, PICKING AND CHOOSING WHICH PUPPETS THAT THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE ON "CAPTAIN KANGAROO" JUST SEEMED VERY SURREAL TO ME. Narrator: KEVIN AND HIS PUPPETS WERE MOVING TO NEW YORK CITY... ...BUT ONE PUPPET STAYED BEHIND. THE DAY HE LEFT, HIS LAST SHOW, HE CALLED ME OVER AND SAID, "CAN I TALK TO YOU?" I SAID, "SURE." HE SAID, "I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS." HE PULLED THE PUPPET ZEE OUT, AND HE SAID, "I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU MORE." I SAID, "KEVIN, YOU'VE GIVEN US SO MUCH HERE AT CHANNEL 2." HE SAID, "NO, I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU MORE." BUT I SAID, "YOU GO AND SOAR." Gladys: YOU KNOW, KEVIN DIDN'T REALLY HAVE AN IN BETWEEN. HE JUMPED FROM HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT TO NEW YORK. Kevin: THEY PUT ME ON THE TRAIN. THEY PUT ME IN A REALLY NICE HOTEL THAT WASN'T THAT FAR AWAY FROM THE CBS STUDIOS. I MEAN, IT WAS AMAZING. THEY ACTUALLY ASKED ME DID I WANT TO ACT ON IT. WANT TO PLAY, HUH? OH, I'M SORRY, SIRE, BUT I MUST TAKE THE ROYAL LAUNDRY TO THE ROYAL LAUNDRY. BUT THE MONEY WAS RIDICULOUS, 'CAUSE IT WAS NETWORK. Narrator: AND IN ANOTHER STUDIO, KERMIT LOVE WAS HELPING CREATE A NEW SHOW CALLED "THE GREAT SPACE COASTER" AND BROUGHT KEVIN ABOARD FOR THE RIDE. Kevin: AND THEN I GOT A CALL FROM JIM HENSON. HE ASKED ME WOULD I BE INTERESTED IN DOING THE MOVIE "DARK CRYSTAL." Narrator: HENSON WAS EMBARKING ON THE MOST AMBITIOUS PRODUCTION OF HIS LIFE. COLLABORATING WITH THE RENOWNED FANTASY ARTIST BRIAN FROUD, HE WAS DESIGNING AN ENTIRELY NEW WORLD OF IMAGINARY CREATURES AND BUILDING THE MOST SOPHISTICATED PUPPETS EVER CREATED. AND THIS WAS ANOTHER, YOU KNOW, WHERE I WAS "YES!" KERMIT WAS THERE AGAIN AND SAID, "LISTEN, YOU HAVE TWO SERIES. "NOW, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL. "A MOVIE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONTHS, AND THEN THAT'S IT. ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE UP THOSE TWO SERIES FOR A MOVIE?" FIRST THING I ASKED HIM IS HOW MUCH IS HE OFFERING. AND I WAS LIKE, "KERMIT, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN, YOU KNOW?" SO I WENT IN TO MEET WITH JIM, MY HEAD DOWN. THIS WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. JIM SAID, "YOU KNOW, WELL, GIVE ME A MINUTE." AND HE WENT OUT. HE CAME BACK IN, AND HE SAID, "WELL, YOU'LL GET THIS MUCH." AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM IS, JIM, I HAVE TWO SERIES THAT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP." AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, WELL, I UNDERSTAND. WE'LL THINK ABOUT CHECKING YOU OUT THE NEXT TIME." AND I REMEMBER WALKING OUT OF THAT OFFICE. OH, I LOST IT. I WENT DOWN TO THE SHOP. THE BUILDERS WERE MAKING THREE-DIMENSIONAL PUPPET VERSIONS OF ALL THE BRIAN FROUD DESIGNS. I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS SAYING TO JIM HENSON "NO, I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T DO THIS PROJECT." WOW. Narrator: KEVIN STAYED BY THE SIDE OF THE CAPTAIN. BUT AS 1984 BEGAN, BOB KEESHAN'S LEGENDARY SHOW WAS IN BIG TROUBLE. Kevin: IT WAS THE 29th SEASON, AND IT WAS ON LIKE 7:00 A.M. IN THE MORNING. NOBODY WAS WATCHING. AND THEN "CAPTAIN KANGAROO" WAS CANCELED. I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, NOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN? I HAVE ONE LEFT." AND THEN THE PRODUCERS DECIDED TO STOP "GREAT SPACE COASTER." I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. AND THEN, LO AND BEHOLD, JIM HENSON ASKED ME TO DO "LABYRINTH." AND I SAID, "YES!" Narrator: KEVIN WAS FLOWN OFF TO LONDON. NOW 25 YEARS OLD, KEVIN HAD FINALLY NAVIGATED HIS WAY INTO THE WORKSHOP OF THE MASTER PUPPETEER HE HAD ADMIRED SINCE HE WAS 10. KEVIN WAS GIVEN A DIFFICULT ASSIGNMENT -- A COMPLICATED SCENE WITH FUNNY DEMONS, CALLED THE FIREYS. Kevin: THERE WAS THIS ONE SEQUENCE WHERE THE FIREY POKES HIS EYES OUT, PULLS THEM OUT, SHAKES THEM, THROWS THEM, AND SAYS, "SNAKE EYES." AND HE'S SUPPOSED TO PULL THEM UP, THROW THEM UP IN THE AIR, SWALLOW THEM AGAIN, AND THEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE COMING BACK, YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. [ Laughing ] SO, WE WERE ON OUR...28th TAKE OF TRYING TO GET THIS. I KNEW, YOU KNOW, WE WERE IN TROUBLE, SO I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD TO GO OVER AND TELL JIM THAT THE SHOT WAS NOT GONNA WORK. I WAS REALLY, REALLY CONCERNED OF WHAT HE WOULD SAY, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT JIM. I SAID, "JIM, YOU KNOW, THE SHOT, YOU KNOW, WITH THE FIREYS THROWING THEIR EYES UP AND SWALLOWING IT --" AS I'M SAYING THIS TO HIM, HE HAS THIS CLOUD OVER HIS FACE LIKE HE DOES NOT WANT TO HEAR THIS AT ALL. "I'M NOT HAVING IT. YOU'RE GONNA GO, AND YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT SHOT." SO AS I WAS SAYING, "YOU KNOW, "THE WHOLE THROWING UP AND THE SWALLOWING -- OKAY, WE'LL GET IT. WE'LL DO IT." [ LAUGHS ] HE SAID, "OH, GOOD." ON THE 29th TAKE...WE GOT IT. Narrator: HENSON HELD A GLITTERING, RED-CARPET PREMIERE IN LONDON. THE CREATURES FROM THE MOVIE WERE IN THE LOBBY TO MEET ALL THE CELEBRITY GUESTS, EVEN PRINCE CHARLES AND DIANA. Kevin: ALL OF US THAT WORKED ON IT GOT TO GO TO THE PREMIERE AND FINALLY SIT DOWN AND SEE THE FINISHED PRODUCT. THE MOVIE STARTS. THE MUSIC IS BEAUTIFUL. YOU KNOW, I SEE THE COMPUTER-GENERATED OWL FLYING PAST. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, MY NAME IS UP THERE. THIS WAS MY FIRST MOVIE, SO IT REALLY BLEW ME AWAY. AND I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THAT MY NAME WOULD BE THERE. ...WONDERFUL. WELL, WE WISH YOU ALL SUCCESS. THE GENEROSITY OF JIM WAS VERY HUMBLING AND VERY EMOTIONAL FOR ME. I'M NOW A PART OF THE MUPPETEERS. I GOT "SESAME STREET." THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A GROUP OF PUPPETEERS TO COME IN AND TAKE OVER IN CERTAIN WAYS... ...BECAUSE JIM WAS NOW PURSUING MOVIES, AND SO THAT'S HOW I GOT PULLED IN, AND KERMIT FINALLY DID IT. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I SEE THE STEPS. IT'S THE STREET. IT'S SESAME STREET. THERE WERE PEOPLE HUSTLING AND BUSTLING, AND I SEE THESE PUPPETEERS THAT I'VE TOTALLY ADMIRED OVER THE YEARS. THEY WERE ALL MY IDOLS -- JERRY NELSON... RICHARD HUNT... FRAN BRILL... MARTY ROBINSON... CAROLL SPINNEY. BOY, I WAS A LITTLE FISH IN A BIG POND. I KNOW, I KNOW! YOU WANTED TO BE A DAZZLEMO. Narrator: ONE OF KEVIN'S FIRST CHARACTERS WAS HOOTS THE OWL. PLAY IT! OH, NO CAN DO, SWEET ONE. THIS IS THE KIND YOU SING. HOOTS THE OWL WAS WORKING OUT OKAY, BUT I WASN'T DOING ENOUGH OF HIM. ♪ THAT'S ALL ♪ THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER CHARACTER CALLED FERLINGHETTI DONIZETTI THAT JUST... LOOK AND BOOK, STEW AND GLUE, BIG AND FIG, MAD AND GLAD... THANK YOU, FERLINGHETTI DONIZETTI! ...ELVIS AND PELVIS, CAT AND HAT, BLUE AND FLEW... AND NOBEL PRICE. THIS IS A FLYING CUPCAKE! [ EXPLOSION ] AH! EUREKA! [ LAUGHS, COUGHS ] WOW! OH, BOY. I CAN'T STOP MOVING. IF I STOP MOVING, I-I'LL STOP JUGGLING. I DID A CHARACTER CALLED JUGGLES. THE HANDS WERE DOING, YOU KNOW [LAUGHS] TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE HEAD WAS DOING, SO THAT FELL APART. JUGGLING IS MY LIFE. WELL, TO MAKE THE PERFECT EMPLOYEE, YOU MUST START WITH THE PROPER RAW MATERIAL. Narrator: KEVIN WAS GIVEN A SHOT AT A TINY COMMERCIAL JOB THAT HENSON WAS DOING ON THE SIDE. Kevin: I HAD TO PERFORM THIS PUPPET THAT WAS LIKE THE ULTIMATE BUSINESSMAN. NOW, THIS IS OUR RAW MATERIAL. YEAH. RIGHT HERE. I WAS SANDWICHED BETWEEN FRANK AND JIM. OH, GOODNESS. I WAS SO NERVOUS. OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. NOT YET, NOT YET. IT'S FRANK OZ AND JIM HENSON. A PERFECT EMPLOYEE MUST BE VERY SMART. FRANK WAS TAKING OFF THE FEATURES, AND I WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE VOICE. [ Nasally voice ] HMM. LET'S EXAMINE ALL ALTERNATE MARKETING CHANNELS. Kevin: I WANTED TO SHOW THEM THAT I COULD DO THIS, THAT HE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. I LITERALLY HAD ONE PHRASE THAT I HAD TO DO EACH TIME THAT THEY CHANGED THE FACE, BUT I JUST COULDN'T MEMORIZE IT 'CAUSE I WAS SO NERVOUS WITH THEM ON BOTH SIDES OF ME. AND SO I HAD THIS LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER THAT HAD THE PHRASE ON IT. [ Authoritative voice ] LET'S PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BOTTOM LINE. STICK TO YOUR BUDGETS. AND THEN JIM SAID TO ME, "YOU CAN'T MEMORIZE THAT?" OH... [ LAUGHS ] I TELL YOU, I SHRUNK RIGHT THEN AND THERE. I WAS LIKE INSIDE OF THE PUPPET. Man: STAND BY. REHEARSAL. AND COUNTDOWN, PLEASE. 5...4... Narrator: ON THE "SESAME STREET" SET, VETERAN MUPPETEER RICHARD HUNT WAS PERFORMING A LITTLE-KNOWN AND RARELY USED MUPPET. [ DRUMS BEATING ] Bob: NO PEEK -- NO PEEKING. [ EXPLOSION ] OH. WHAT'S THAT? [ GASPS ] BROKE BALLOON. ELMO... [ Deep voice ] UH-OH. ELMO SQUEAK BALLOON TOO HARD. [ LAUGHS ] Kevin: AT THE BEGINNING, ELMO HAD KIND OF CAVEMAN-TYPE TALK. ELMO, I MEAN, UH, WHAT'S -- WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? ME FIND RHYME FOR "BOYS"! YOU DID? WHAT IS IT? RHYME FOR "BOYS" IS "NOISE"! I WAS IN THE ROOM. I WAS THERE AT THE TIME WHEN RICHARD HUNT WAS JUST TOTALLY FED UP WITH HIS CHARACTER. YOU KNOW, RICHARD'S A SEASONED PUPPETEER. YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HIS JOB. HE COULD DO WHATEVER HE WANTED TO DO. HE WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE, "I HATE THIS DAMN PUPPET. I'M SUFFERING WITH IT." SO YOU CAN KIND OF TELL [Laughing] HE WASN'T PLEASED WITH IT. Narrator: RICHARD LEFT THE SET, CARRYING THE RED MUPPET LIKE AN OLD MOP. Kevin: HE CAME INTO THE MUPPET ROOM, AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE PUPPETEERS CONGREGATE, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE'RE HANGING OUT TO WAIT TO GO ON. AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE ROOM. TOSSED IT IN KEVIN'S LAP AND SAID, "SEE IF YOU CAN GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS PUPPET." Kevin: YOU KNOW, HE IS ONE OF THE MAIN GUYS WITH JIM. IF HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT, WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH IT? YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW. AND I SAID... [ High-pitched voice ] HELLO! THIS IS ELMO! AND HE SAID, "OKAY." "FINE. GIVE IT A TRY." Kevin: I REALLY WANTED TO SUCCEED, SO I WENT BACK TO BALTIMORE, HOPING THAT THIS CHARACTER CAN HOLD ITS OWN WITH ERNIE AND BERT, BIG BIRD, COOKIE, ALL THOSE WONDERFUL CHARACTERS THAT ARE LEGENDARY TO US NOW. WHEN I GOT BACK HOME, I KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT I HAD TO THINK ABOUT TO REALLY GET SOMEWHERE WITH BRINGING THIS CHARACTER TO LIFE. AND SO I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT FRANK ALWAYS SAID WHEN HE WAS CREATING A CHARACTER. HE SAID, "FIND ONE SPECIAL HOOK FOR THAT CHARACTER." LIKE WITH FOZZIE BEAR, HE SAID HE REALLY FOCUSES ON THE VAUDEVILLE COMEDIAN WHEN HE PERFORMS FOZZIE. AND HE SAID MISS PIGGY IS A TRUCK DRIVER WANTING TO BE A WOMAN. AND SO I KEPT THOSE THINGS IN MIND AS I HUNG OUT WITH MY MOM AND THE DAYCARE KIDS. I WATCHED THE KIDS AND THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC ESSENCE, THAT ONE THING THAT WOULD SAY THIS IS ELMO TO ME. AND THEN I GOT IT -- THE ONE THING THAT IS JUST RIGHT FOR ELMO. [ GROANS ] THE FIRST SCRIPT WAS THIS CUTE LITTLE SCRIPT WITH ELMO GOING ON AN IMAGINARY VACATION. SAY, UH, ELMO... YES, LUIS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ELMO GOING ON A MAKE-BELIEVE TRIP AS SOON AS WE DO ONE THING. YEAH? WHAT'S THAT? COME DOWN HERE, LUIS. COME ON DOWN. SEE? OKAY. COME ON. WHAT? HERE IT IS. OH. GOODBYE HUG. I KNEW THAT ELMO SHOULD REPRESENT LOVE, JUST KISSING AND HUGGING. OKAY. GOODBYE. BYE-BYE. SUITCASE. [ GROANS ] ELMO BACK! [ GIGGLES ] NO MORE GOODBYE HUGS. ELMO LOVES YOU. HE JUST LOVES YOU. AND WHEN HE SAYS THAT, YOU GET IT. WHAT? DO THIS... HELLO HUG! YOU PROBABLY SEE A LOT OF WHAT KEVIN WAS LIKE AS A LITTLE KID. HE WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE SCAMP AND VERY SWEET. THE PURE INNOCENCE PART OF KEVIN THAT I THINK HE ALWAYS WANTS TO BE, BUT PEOPLE WOULD THINK HE WAS A CRAZY PERSON IF HE WAS ALWAYS THAT WAY AS AN ADULT. I ALWAYS SAY THAT ELMO IS NOT KEVIN. ELMO IS MR. AND MRS. CLASH. THEY'D BE SUPPORTIVE WHATEVER KEVIN DID. KEVIN HAS PUT THIS INTO ELMO. Kevin: ELMO'S LIKE MY DAD. HE'S VERY IMAGINATIVE AND CREATIVE. AND ELMO'S ALSO LIKE MY MOTHER. THE BALL OF FIRE THAT ELMO IS, MY MOM IS LIKE THAT, A LOT OF ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT LIFE. AND THE WRITERS THOUGHT, "THIS IS ACTUALLY A NICE LITTLE NICHE THAT WE DON'T HAVE." HE'S KIND OF THE YOUNGEST, YOU KNOW, OF ALL THE CHARACTERS. AND THEN RESEARCH STARTED LOOKING INTO IF, YOU KNOW, THE KIDS WERE ACTUALLY LEARNING FROM ELMO, AND THEY WERE. ...SESAME STREET. Cooney: I WOULD GO OVER TO THE STUDIO, AND PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON THE SHOW STARTED TALKING ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN -- KEVIN THIS AND KEVIN THAT. AND IT WAS HARD NOT TO HAVE HIM ON YOUR RADAR SCREEN, BECAUSE THIS WAS TAKING OFF. [ LAUGHS ] Kevin: I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A CHARACTER AND TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK, AND THEN ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS STARTED HAPPENING ON "SESAME STREET" WHERE, YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD SAY, "WELL, THERE'S A CHILD THAT HAS A WISH OF SPENDING TIME WITH ELMO." AND I WOULD SAY, "OKAY. THAT'S COOL." AND THEY WOULD SAY, "WELL, THE WISH IS BECAUSE SHE'S A SICK CHILD, AND THIS IS HER DYING WISH." AND I WAS LIKE, "WOW." YOU KNOW, I HAD NO IDEA. TO THIS DAY, WHEN A MAKE-A-WISH CHILD OR A SICK CHILD IS THERE, THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME, THEY'LL ASK FOR ELMO. BRING MARIA OVER. COME ON, COME ON. COME ON OVER. AW, HELLO, MARIA. ELMO'S SO HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE. WILL YOU GIVE ELMO A KISS? KISS, KISS, KISS, KISS. MWAH. HI, EVERYBODY. COME ON IN, DADDY. [ GIGGLES ] THANK YOU FOR COMING. KISS AGAIN. KISS, KISS. KISS, KISS. [ SMOOCHES ] [ SIGHS ] ELMO'S HAPPY NOW. ELMO WILL BE LIKE YOU. GOOD! EVERYBODY, CONGRATULATE MARIA FOR COMING! YAY! [ APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHS ] BYE-BYE, DADDY. BYE, BROTHER. BYE, MOMMY. COMING IN AS A PUPPETEER, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW CONNECTED AND HOW LOVED THE SHOW REALLY IS TO THE FAMILY. THAT'S WHEN I KNEW THAT THIS WAS BIGGER THAN ME. TOYS, TOYS. WHEN MY EX-WIFE, GENIA, WAS PREGNANT, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CREATION... ...DIFFERENT FROM FOAM AND GLUE. ELMO -- ELMO WANTED TO GET IN HERE TO TELL YOU THAT GENIA IS IN LABOR WITH YOU! Kevin: I REMEMBER SHOOTING ELMO SAYING, "COME IN. WE GET TO SEE EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME." Elmo: THERE'S YOUR MOMMY. [ LAUGHS ] SHE'S GOING TO THE HOSPITAL TO HAVE YOU RIGHT NOW. AND THIS IS YOUR MOMMY'S SISTER-IN-LAW, AND THAT'S YOUR MOMMY'S MOMMY. [ LAUGHS ] YOU KNOW, AND GENIA'S SAYING, YOU KNOW, "WILL YOU PUT THE DAMN CAMERA DOWN AND GET IN THE CAR?" WHEN SHE FINALLY WAS BORN, GENIA WOULD GET MAD WITH ME, 'CAUSE I'D BE TRYING TO PUPPETEER HER, PUPPETEER SHANNON, YOU KNOW, MOVING HER LEGS, YOU KNOW, AND MOVING HER LIPS TO MAKE HER TALK AND EVERYTHING. AND SHE WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW, "THIS IS NOT A PUPPET. THIS IS A REAL BABY." HEY, SHANNON. HEY, GIRL. A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER, I WENT TO BABY DEPOT. I PUT SHANNON IN THE CAR, ROAMED AROUND, AND I SAW THE TICKLE ME ELMO DOLL. I WAS LIKE, "UH, TICKLE ME?" YOU KNOW, I NEVER REALLY SAY -- WITH ELMO, I NEVER SAY "ME." SO I WAS LIKE, "WELL, THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK [LAUGHS] "TICKLE ME. IT SHOULD BE 'TICKLE ELMO.'" [ GIGGLING ] PARENTS ARE LINING UP BEFORE DAWN IN FRONT OF TOY STORES. [ SCREAMING ] THIS IS THE BEATLES OF TOYS THIS YEAR. Man: NO PUSHING! A CANADIAN SALES CLERK TRAMPLED AND SENT TO THE HOSPITAL. I HAD ONE IN MY HAND. AND REALLY, THE LADY JUMPED ME AND BEAT ME UP. KEVIN CALLED ME UP AND SAID, "MAMA, DO YOU SEE THE WAVES OF PEOPLE GOING CRAZY?" LOOK. HE SHAKES, HE LAUGHS. [ GIGGLES ] HE'S SHAKING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I GET, "HOLD ON. ROSIE, PICK UP LINE TWO." AND IT'S AARON SPELLING. AND AARON SPELLING LIKE A, YOU KNOW, HUGE, HUGE, MAJOR MEDIA MOGUL, HOLLYWOOD BILLIONAIRE, BIGGEST HOUSE IN HOLLYWOOD, RIGHT? "ROSIE, IT'S AARON SPELLING. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET ME TWO TICKLE ME ELMOS?" I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?" I FELT LIKE A CRACK DEALER. Woman: AT THE HEIGHT OF THE TICKLE ME ELMO CRAZE... SAY SOMETHING OTHER THAN "ELMO." ...EVERYBODY WANTED ELMO, ELMO, ELMO, ELMO. Kevin: THE SCHEDULE THAT I HAD, I'D BE IN L.A., OR I'D BE IN JAPAN, OR I'D BE IN CHINA, OR I'D BE IN SOUTH AFRICA. I STARTED TRAVELING SO MUCH. I WASN'T THERE FOR THE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL. YAY! I MET SO MANY CELEBRITIES. [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING ] RIGHT THERE WAS ELMO, SINGING WITH THEM OR ACTING WITH THEM. THAT IS SOME CONCENTRATION, ELMO. CAN'T TALK, MR. HUGH. WHAT? ELMO'S CONCENTRATING. I'M SORRY. HMM... HI. THIS IS ELMO'S FRIEND WHOOPI. HI, EVERYONE. IT WAS AMAZING. WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS KOFI ANNAN. I'M THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS. OH! WELL, ELMO IS ELMO. THERE WERE SOME CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE NEEDED TO BE AN ADDITIONAL PERFORMER ON ELMO IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMAND. AND KEVIN WAS LIKE, "NO. I CAN DO IT." SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED A CELEBRITY LULLABY. WHAT, IS IT BRAD PITT? ELMO LOVES BRAD PITT. IT'S NOT BRAD PITT. IT'S RICKY GERVAIS. THAT'S ME. UH, IS MR. RICKY GERVAIS A CELEBRITY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, OF COURSE I AM. [ APPLAUSE ] YOU DON'T HAVE A BLACK MAN WALKING BEHIND YOU LIKE ELMO DOES, DO YOU? [ LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE ] HAVE YOU GOT SOME FUNKY DANCE MOVES? OH, YEAH. DO YOU WANT TO SEE ELMO DANCE? OH, YES, PLEASE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, YEAH. TAKE IT TO THE BANK. Kevin: IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. AND THEN I STARTED TO GET MORE AND MORE RESPONSIBILITY ON "SESAME STREET." Cheryl: KEVIN HAS REALLY DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO "SESAME STREET." HE'S ELMO. HE IS ALSO MUPPET CAPTAIN. HE'S ALSO PRODUCER. HE'S ALSO DIRECTOR. HE'S ALSO EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF "SESAME STREET." AND HE'S ESSENTIAL TO THAT SHOW. Kevin: BEING AWAY SO MUCH, THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WAS DOING SHOWS WITH CHILDREN SHANNON'S AGE. [ LAUGHTER ] Kevin: WHO-O-O-A. YOU KNOW, I THINK I KNOW WHAT HE'S PRETENDING TO BE. ANYBODY KNOW WHAT HE IS? [ ALL CHEERING ] THERE I WAS, SPENDING TIME AND PLAYING WITH THEM. WHAT IS IT? A BALLOON! THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT IS! ELMO, ARE YOU A BALLOON?! [ LAUGHTER ] I DEFINITELY FELT I WOULD RATHER BE, YOU KNOW, WITH SHANNON, GIVING HER THAT TIME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Man: YOU GUYS WERE GREAT. GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE. Narrator: IN FEBRUARY 1990, JIM HENSON BROUGHT ALL OF HIS MUPPETEERS TO FLORIDA TO FILM A TELEVISION SPECIAL CALLED "THE MUPPETS AT DISNEY WORLD." Kevin: THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I GOT TO GO TO DISNEY WORLD. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY, AND WE WERE SITTING ON THE SIDEWALK, AND I SAID TO JIM, "WE NEVER HAD A PHOTO TAKEN OF EACH OTHER." AND HE SAID, "WELL, I'LL SET THAT UP RIGHT NOW." SO, HIS PHOTOGRAPHER THERE, AND HE SAID, "NOW, I HAVE THE SCRIPT HERE. LET'S LOOK LIKE WE'RE WORKING." AND SO HE OPENED UP THE SCRIPT, AND HE POINTED, AND I'M LOOKING, YOU KNOW, LIKE WE'RE DOING WORK. IT MAKES ME LAUGH. JIM AND I WERE BECOMING FRIENDS. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN. AND OVER ONE DINNER THAT WE HAD, HE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS SO HAPPY THAT ELMO WAS WORKING OUT AND REALLY IS A LOT OF FUN AND VERY SWEET AND WORKS VERY, VERY WELL ON "SESAME STREET." THAT WAS REALLY A WONDERFUL THING TO HEAR FROM JIM. [ APPLAUSE ] HE ASKED ME TO BE ON "THE ARSENIO HALL SHOW" WITH HIM. IT WAS A CHARACTER THAT HE ACTUALLY HELPED ME CREATE CALLED CLIFFORD. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH." WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE YOU STARTED WORKING WITH KERMIT? I WAS A SPONGE, MAN. WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I WAS DOING? [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Kevin: I NOTICED THAT HE WAS COMPLAINING OF A SORE THROAT. TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT, I GOT A CALL FROM ONE OF HIS ASSISTANTS. "DID YOU HEAR ABOUT JIM?" AND I SAID, "YEAH. I KNOW HE'S UNDER THE WEATHER." AND SHE SAID, "NO. THEY'RE SAYING HE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT." AND I WENT INTO SHOCK. Man: THIS IS "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" WITH PETER JENNINGS. GOOD EVENING. A LITTLE OF THE MAGIC IS GONE. JIM HENSON, THE MAN WHO CREATED THE MUPPETS, THE MAN WHO MADE COMPLEX CHARACTERS OUT OF CLOTH, HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF ONLY 53. HE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL HERE IN NEW YORK CITY YESTERDAY, AND HE DIED VERY EARLY... Man: ♪ IF JUST ONE PERSON BELIEVES IN YOU... ♪ Kevin: PRIOR TO HIS DEATH, HE WROTE A LETTER TO US. ♪ BEFORE YOU KNEW IT ♪ ♪ SOMEONE ELSE WOULD THINK ♪ ♪ "IF HE CAN DO IT ♪ HE SAID... ♪ "I CAN DO IT" ♪ "I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO HAVE BLACK ON." ♪ MAKING IT, TWO WHOLE PEOPLE... ♪ "I WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE COLOR ON." AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW, AND YOU CAN'T DISAGREE WITH ME. "I'M GONE, YOU KNOW? YOU HAVE TO ABIDE BY WHAT I'M SAYING." ♪ THERE'S BOUND TO BE SOME OTHER PERSON ♪ ♪ WHO BELIEVES IN MAKING IT A THREESOME ♪ HI. ♪ MAKING IT THREE ♪ Kevin: IT WAS A HUGE LOSS FOR ME, BUT, ALSO, I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I GOT TO WORK WITH HIM AND HE LIKED WHAT I DID. ♪ AND IF THREE WHOLE PEOPLE, WHY NOT FOUR? ♪ ♪ AND IF FOUR WHOLE PEOPLE, WHY NOT MORE AND MORE AND MORE? ♪ [ APPLAUSE ] ♪ AND WHEN ALL THOSE PEOPLE BELIEVE IN YOU... ♪ Kevin: SHANNON PUT TOGETHER AN E-MAIL TO ME. SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW, DAD, I'M PROBABLY GONNA BE LEAVING "TO GO TO COLLEGE IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS, "AND PLEASE LOOK INTO GIVING ME SOME TIME BEFORE I LEAVE TO DO THAT." THAT DEFINITELY [CHUCKLES] KNOCKED ME IN THE HEAD. SO I TOLD THE COMPANY THESE ARE THE DATES THAT ARE OFF-LIMITS, BECAUSE I WOULD RATHER BE THERE THAN WORKING. DO YOU LIKE THE BAG? THEY MIGHT BE TOO SMALL. Kevin: I'LL HOLD IT. YEAH, I'LL HOLD IT. THERE WE GO. [ APPLAUSE ] HAPPY BIRTHDAY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW, IT JUST MELTS YOU. I TELL YOU, THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA DO THIS IF SHE GETS MARRIED. I CAN'T. I WOULDN'T GET THROUGH IT. ALL RIGHT, WE GOT A SURPRISE FOR SHANNON. LET'S BRING DOWN THE LIGHTS. SWEET 16. IT'S ME, JACK BLACK. I'M SAYING HAPPY SWEET 16. ENJOY IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MWAH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SHANNON, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SWEET 16. YOU ARE THE WINNER. EVERYBODY SALUTES YOU AND LOVES YOU. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HI, SHANNON. ELMO JUST WANTED TO SAY HAPPY 16th BIRTHDAY, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ] ELMO LOVES YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. SPEAK TO YOU SOON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Kevin: I CREATED PUPPETS EVER SINCE I WAS 10 YEARS OLD, BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE, YOU KNOW, CREATING A HUMAN BEING. THAT'S AMAZING. IT IS JUST AMAZING. I TELL YOU, EVERY SINGLE DAY I THINK ABOUT HOW AMAZING IT IS. IT JUST BLOWS ME AWAY. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I BECAME A PUPPETEER, TOO, JUST OBSERVING THE HUMAN SPIRIT. THERE'S JUST -- THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT. I'VE BEEN VERY, VERY LUCKY, VERY BLESSED. I GO AROUND TALKING TO KIDS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD, SAYING IF EVERYBODY ELSE YOUR AGE IS DOING SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU'RE DOING, THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOMEONE SAYING TO YOU THAT YOU MIGHT NOT SUCCEED WITH IT. YOU MIGHT NOT MAKE ANY MONEY WITH THAT. THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE SOME TYPE OF OBSTACLE IN THE WAY. ALL OF THOSE THINGS WILL GO AWAY IF YOU REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY. COOL. [ Telephone rings ] TAU: Hello. HELLO, TAU. Hello? HI. THIS IS KEVIN CLASH FROM "SESAME STREET." HOW ARE YOU? No, you're not! I KNOW WHO I AM. [ Laughs ] LESLIE CARRARA SAID THAT SHE MET YOU DOWN IN ATLANTA AND SAID THAT YOU'RE A HUGE FAN AND YOU STARTED BUILDING PUPPETS WHEN YOU WERE 8. Sometime during that time, yes. OKAY. WHAT TYPE OF MATERIALS DO YOU USE? I use, um... fleece and foam and sometimes white, plastic spoons for eyes. Uh, I have so many questions. HEY. COME ON IN. HOW ARE YOU? [ LAUGHS ] HI. HI, MR. CLASH. Tau: OH, DEAR LORD. WHAT'S THIS PUPPET'S NAME? HIS NAME IS JUICE. JUICE? YEP. OH, THAT'S SIMON THE SALMON. YES. [ LAUGHS ] I THINK I CAN NAME ALL OF THESE PEOPLE. OKAY. DO IT. WELL, ONLY THE PUPPETEERS. OKAY, WELL, THIS ONE IS JERRY NELSON. I THINK THAT ONE'S CAROL WILCOX. YES. CAROLY WILCOX, YEAH. THAT'S JIM HENSON. THAT'S FRANK OZ AND RICHARD HUNT. YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS ALL THE WAY OVER THERE? YOU NEVER GOT TO SEE HIM. OH, WAIT. JON STONE? YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] SEE, YOU WOULD HAVE GOT AN "A." [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WONDERING WHERE YOU GET THAT MATERIAL FROM. THESE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT FURS. THESE ARE THEIR EYES AND EARS. [ GASPS ] [ Old man's voice ] HOW YOU DOING? YOU SURE YOU DON'T HAVE AN APPLE OR A SUGAR CUBE SOMEWHERE IN THERE, ANYWHERE? [ LAUGHS ] [ BABBLING ] PICK ONE. THIS ONE. HOW DID YOU LEARN HOW TO WORK THE PUPPET? DID YOU JUST KEEP WATCHING "SESAME"? WHAT DID YOU DO? YEAH. I KEPT WATCHING "SESAME STREET," AND I WAS CATCHING ON HOW TO DO IT. SAW DIFFERENT VIDEOS. HOW DID YOU KNOW YOU WAS DOING IT RIGHT? WELL, I LOOKED WHILE I WAS DOING THE PUPPETRY. EXACTLY WHAT I DID. LIKE I SAID, YOU FOCUS ON YOUR LIP SYNC. Kevin: WHEN I'M TEACHING A CHILD WHO IS INTERESTED IN WHAT I DO, I BECOME ONE OF THEM. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES WITH PUPPETEERS... I'M PASSING ALONG THE ENJOYMENT OVER SO MANY YEARS OF WORKING ALONGSIDE THESE MASTERS. YOU REALLY HAVE A NICE, NATURAL MOVEMENT TO YOUR PUPPET. THAT'S REALLY GOOD. THANK YOU. [ As Elmo ] YOU'RE WELCOME. LIKE THEY SAW WITH ME, IT'S SO REWARDING. HI THERE, ELMO. WHAT'S UP? HI, PORKY. PORKY. IS THAT YOUR NAME -- PORKY? YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S MY NAME. HIGH FIVE. OR HIGH FOUR. [ LAUGHS ] WHEN ELMO GROWS UP, ELMO WANTS TO BE A TEACHER. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. HOW DOES ELMO FEEL WHEN HE KNOWS THAT HE HELPED SOMEBODY? ELMO FEELS VERY HAPPY, BECAUSE ELMO WOULD LOVE TO HELP THEM, BECAUSE THEY HELP ELMO ALL THE TIME. [ INDISTINCT YELLING ] Goldberg: THE THING THAT PEOPLE LOVE ABOUT ELMO IS HE NEEDS THEM, AND THAT'S WHY LITTLE KIDS LOVE HIM, BECAUSE HE NEEDS THEM, TOO. ELMO! HELLO! GOOD TO SEE YOU! YAY! HUG, HUG, HUG. HUG ELMO. HUG. HUG ELMO. MWAH, MWAH! THERE IS A FEELING THAT THEY CAN DO ANYTHING, AS LONG AS THEY'VE GOT THEIR ELMO WITH THEM. HELLO, MR. CLASH. HELLO. [ As Elmo ] HOW ARE YOU? I ATTRIBUTE THAT TO KEVIN, BECAUSE OF HIS EMBODIMENT OF THIS CHARACTER AND WHAT HE MEANS TO CHILDREN. [ TRUMPET PLAYS ] [ GROANS ] Spinney: HIS ELMO, LIKE A LOT OF GOOD PUPPETEERS, YOU PUT A LOT OF YOURSELF IN IT. AND I THINK THAT THE DICKENS IN KEVIN COMES OUT IN LITTLE ELMO. I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S JUST SO DARN GOOD. Oz: THERE'S SO MANY TERRIFIC PUPPETEERS, AND KEVIN IS A BROTHER LIKE THE OTHER PERFORMERS ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. HE REALLY DOES EXEMPLIFY WHAT JIM HENSON BEGAN WITH, YOU KNOW, THAT JIM WAS CREATING SOMETHING THAT TOUCHED EVERYONE. [ SMOOCHES ] WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE EXCITEMENT THAT HE'S GIVEN US OVER SO MANY YEARS AND OF THE SPIRIT AND THE CAMARADERIE AND THE SILLINESS, YOU CAN SEE IT THROUGH ME.
