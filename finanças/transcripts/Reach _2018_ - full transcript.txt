- My name is Steven Turano and tonight I'm gonna kill myself. - Steven, you ready? We're leaving in two! - Depression. That's the word people use. Just because I think about it doesn't mean that I... I really want to do it. You can do this. Just get out of the chair. Is that mine? - It was. Breakfast is for people who are on time. Come on, let's go. - Okay. - Look, when you're late, I'm late, okay? What are you doing in your room anyway? Come on. - It's only my first day. - Seat belt. - Okay. That's my dad. He's a cop. Treats me more like I... I should be in the Army or following some book of rules because he screwed up. I don't know. Most days we don't really talk. I don't know if he can't look me in the eye because of me or because of himself. - Must Charles and Doris's grandson. Let's hope they get that one right. Geez. - Like you're getting it right? You don't even know them. You don't even know me. Why can't you stop judging everybody? - Steven. Let's make it a strong year, son. - A small arts school might seem like a way to protect your kid from the world because it's artsy fartsy or whatever but there's no real way to protect your kid from school unless you talk to them or they feel safe there. But how do you feel safe? - Look, guys. It's our very own resident time traveler who went back to 1995 and picked up a trapper keeper for elementary school. - Nice scarf, Richard. - Oh, nice attitude, Kim. - Richard. - Kim. Now that everyone's here, I can actually start my announcements. - Go ahead. - Right. Whew! I just want to start by welcoming everybody back. Welcome back. We have a great year in store for you guys. We have three new plays on the schedule, which is just super exciting. The first play is Anything Goes. ♪ Anything goes - And I love it because my dad actually grew up on a ship. He wasn't in the Navy, he was just poor, but... - Hi. - Hi, and you are? - Clarence, Clarence West. - Clarence, you're late. - I know, I'm sorry. It's my first day here. My first day at school actually. Oh, here's a banana. Thought it'd be cooler than an apple. - Clarence, Clarence West. Have a seat. - Okay. - What kind of a name is Clarence West? Are you a jazz musician? - I love jokes. We're gonna get along great. Clarence. - Richard, but, um, too many rings. - Okay, Richard. I love your scarf, it's very dapper. - Oh, thanks so much. I like your outfit. Did a hipster throw it up? Did you get it from the eclectic douchebag boutique? - Okay, well, this was actually made for me by two less fortunate souls while I was volunteering in South America. They're actually no longer with us. Moment of silence. - Okay. Just a reminder, auditions are in three weeks so I'll see y'all there. You can stay home. - Emma? - Here! - Ella. - Here. - Steven. - And it hit me, it's your senior year. Dude, aren't you pumped? - I don't know, it's whatever. - You think I could be a conductor? - I don't know, would you just be careful with that? - Hey, bud. - Aw, shit. - Hey, Steven. How was your summer? Oh, you don't want to talk to me now? I mean, it's our last year together, bud. What's this? - Come on, Nick, that's a gift to Steven. - Huh, this yours? Oh, I bet you want to hit me now, huh? Do it. Come on. Do it. Hit me. Do it, hit me. - Hey, that's enough. - Hey! I don't know who you are, but this doesn't concern you. - Okay. - Hey, what the hell, let me go! - Or you'll what? You keep moving and your arm's gonna snap, bud. - Get off of me! - Apologize. - No, no way. - Apologize. Right now. To what's your name, kid? - Steven. Steven Turano. - There it is, now just say it. - No. - Say it, say I'm sorry. Two seconds. Do it! Say it. - I'm sorry, Steven. Okay? Is that what you wanted to hear? You're done here. - Oh. - Nick. - What's that guy's deal? - I'm sorry for my boyfriend. Are you alright? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Alright. - Screw that guy. - Hey, what's going on here? Three of you, come with me. - What? Where'd you learn how to do that? - Japan. - What are you? - Good afternoon, gentlemen. So. Why don't you tell me your side of the story? - Miss Simmons, we were just walking in the hallway, going to our lockers, all three of us, normally, when Nick comes up to us, angrier than ever, and he just wants to start like a fight with us. - Okay, okay, okay, slow down. Let's go back. - Ma'am, if I may? I'm sorry, we haven't formally met yet, I'm Clarence. Clarence West. Very nice to meet you. Well, ma'am, I was just minding my own business, listening to some music when I noticed a commotion in the distance. I saw Nick, is it? I saw Nick and he was harassing these two fine gentlemen. Nick then grabbed Steven's conductor baton and broke it over his leg. I waited and I waited as long as I could for a faculty member to come assist, but sadly no one came. I figured that I'd step in before things got serious. Nick then attacked me. I simply defended myself with a standing Kimura armlock. - Wait, wait, wait. What's a Kimura armlock? - It's essentially a reverse arm entanglement? Volunteering in Japan, I practiced the art of judo. Anyway, I successfully immobilized Nick. I asked him to cease and apologize, he complied. At which time, Mrs. Mack finally came over. I'm sorry, ma'am. I feared for Steven, I really did. I'm confident when you review your security cam footage, it's gonna corroborate the statement I'm giving you here. - Is this who he really is? He seems to have it figured out. Wish I could say the same for Nick. - Is that what you've been doing? Playing grab-ass with Turano? Huh? - Dude, that karate stuff was crazy. You think you could teach me that sometime? - Yeah, anytime. What's that kid's deal anyways? - Oh, I don't know. Nick hates everybody. He especially has it out for Steven. - Well, that's lame. That was his pops, I'm assuming? - Yeah, Officer Perkins. - Textbook. - Well, since we're here, what's your next class? - Um, it is... Drama two. - Perfect, right next to band. Let's go. - Oh, alright. - Welcome back, everyone. I hope you had an amazing summer. I've already seen a couple new faces on campus, which is exciting. I have an incredible year planned for you all. Hi. Are you Clarence West? - Yes. - So without further ado, let's welcome to the stage our new student, Clarence West. ♪ Clarence West - Girls! Girls! Girls! - Wow. Thank you everyone. And thank you, Mr... - Dates. Tony Dates. But you can call me... ♪ Mr. Tony - Yeah, okay. Thank you, Mr. Tony. Alright. - Uh, uh, uh. Don't even think about it, Mr. West Side Story. - I'm sorry? - Oh, no, that word is not allowed in here. - Well, I'm sor-- - Now get up here and show me what you've got, Clarence West. - Oh, I see you want me to do? - Could be anything. A song, a dance number, a monologue, a one man show. Do a cartwheel, juggle for god's sakes. We don't care, just get up here. - Okay. Anything? - What happens in drama... ♪ Stays in drama - I like that. Okay. Into the white upturned wandering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him. When he bestrides the lazy pacing clouds and sails upon the bosoms of the air. - Romeo? Romeo. Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name! Or if thou shalt not, then I shall be but sworn by love and I'll no longer be a Capulet. - Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this? - Tis my name that is my enemy. Thou aren't myself if not a Montague. What's Montague? Does nor hand nor foot nor arm or face nor any other part of a man? - Oh sweet, so would I. I will kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow. Shall I say good night? Till it be morrow. Sleeped well upon thine eyes. Peace in thy breast. If I were to sleep, so sweet to rest. Hence will I to my ghostly father sell, his help to crave and my dear have to tell. - Yes, yes, bravo, boys. See, this is what art is about. Instinct, impulse, collaboration, presence. - Cool. That's awesome. We good? - Yeah, congratulations. - So then what happened? How'd you end up teaching here? - Well, I left Hollywood, went back to New York, best place ever. And did a few off-off-Broadway plays. And I realized that this is where my heart is, so I went back to school to get my master's in education and that way I can teach what I love. - Theater. Do you ever miss it? - Acting? Sometimes. Hollywood, god no. - God. That's where I'm headed. I already have a place there. I just gotta finish here first. - Young guy like you? You'll clean up. - Thanks for today, Mr. Tony. This year's gonna be great. - Already is. And hey, I'd love to read your work sometime. Bring it in whenever. - Okay, sounds good. Yo, friends. - Yo, homie! - I'm hungry. You guys want to get some comida or something, huh? - We should totally go to the lounge. - Okay. - Daniel, come on, let's go. 2:05. - Alright, later homies. I'mma peace. - Why are you talking like that? - I don't know. Alright, bye guys. - See ya. - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. You want to, like, get some food? - Uh, no. I have a lot to get done. You know, homework and practice and stuff. - No, no, no, no, come on, come on. It's on me. - I have to finish learning this new piece for band. - Dude, dude, dude, dude, it's the first day of school. Come on, I'll drive you home after. - You're not gonna take no for an answer, are you? - Are you gonna turn down free food? Come on, man, one meal isn't gonna kill you. Let's make this happen. - Nick. Hi, it's me. Why did you have to start in with him on the first day of school? And with my brother? - Bon appetit. - Thanks. - What are you listening to? - Huh? - What are you listening to? - Oh, you wouldn't know it. - Oh, I wouldn't know Tchaikovsky? I mean, I'm more of an Eric Clapton fan myself but I know Tchaikovsky. - My mom listened to Eric Clapton. - Well, your mom has good taste. I'd love to meet her. - Well, you can't, she dead. - No way, my parents are dead too. - That's not funny. - No, I'm serious, I'm serious. Why do you think I'm here in suburbia? Both my parents died last year in a motorcycle accident. I just moved in with my grandparents so I could finish high school. Why would I lie about something like that? What's that Nick kid's deal anyways? - I don't know. We used to be best friends. - What happened? - My dad and his dad were partners when we were kids and then... Things change. - Like what? - You know Nick was in a boy band, right? - You see, now that makes sense. Sad. - So what's your deal? - What do you mean, my deal? - You know, you're not like most kids. Karate and the way you dress and the knowledge of classical music. I mean, where are you from? - I grew up traveling. I was never really in one country too long. Kinda bounced around. - Were your parents in like the military or something? - God no. No, no, no, they were quite the opposite actually. I mean, for the most part, they were just hippies. But they were very successful entrepreneurs. When I was born, they started traveling the world. Used to say I was homeschooled out of home. - Did you make any friends? - More like acquaintances. Yeah. I mean, for the most part, stories were my friends, man. Books, movies, plays. When we were in a new city, we'd see a new play. - What time is it? - It's... 5:30-ish. What? If you don't get home by a certain time, your dad will like kill you? - Yeah. - Oh, dude, hey, wait, I'll give you a ride home, neighbor. - Why is he being so nice to me? There's no way he can't make other friends. Feels weird. - So like what time do you usually wake up for school? - Like 5:30. - God. - My dad usually-- - Oh, you see, there it is, okay. I'll honk at seven. - What? - I'll drive you. - No, it's okay. - Dude, I'll see you at seven, get out of my car. - You're weird, dude. - Later. - Downstairs, five minutes! - Yeah. - You got about one minute before we head out. - I forgot to tell you that I have a ride to school today. - You do? From who? - Clarence. Charles and Doris's grandson, the new kid who moved in across the street, remember? - Clarence. Am I gonna meet this kid? Is he gonna be on time? - Hi, you must be Mr. Turano. It's wonderful to meet you. - Hey. - Steven, you ready? We gotta be out by oh-700. - That your car? - Oh, yes sir, it is. My father and I built it from the ground up actually. - Impressive. You a mechanic? - I like to use the term engineer. Mechanic seems to suggest just cars. I like to build all things really. Hoping to go to college for it. Fingers crossed. - Good luck with that. Steven. - Bye. - Mr. Turano. - Nice to meet you, Clarence. - Ditto. - Drive safe. - Absolutely! - What was that? - What I did just got us a get out of jail free card for now or for any time in the future. - We're gonna be late for school. - Yeah, about that. - No, no, no, no, no, I can't miss school. My dad's already pissed about yesterday. You know the attendance office is gonna call him. - Are they? - What? No. You cannot call the attendance office, don't do that. - Uh, yeah, hi, how ya doin'? This is Mr. Turano. Shut up. Yeah, Steven's not gonna be in today, he's a little shooken up after the incident yesterday, I'm sure you heard all about it. Yeah, he's fine, just gonna take the day. Also I'm not sure if you have my updated number on file. Do you have a pen close by? It's 458-555-0101. Yeah, you go ahead and call me in the future if there's any other issues. Alright. You too, ma'am. - How did you do that? - Genius, right? - Do you have any idea how crazy my dad is? He's gonna reverse detective that or something, I'm gonna be in so much trouble, you have no idea! - Dude, hey, this is fun. We're having fun. It's gonna be fine, stop looking ahead, okay? Have you ever played hooky before? - No. - I'm so excited. - Where are we going? - Don't worry about it, I got this. Stop asking questions and just relax, man. I need some coffee. - Where are we? - Don't worry about it. - Okay. This is fun. - Hate to say I told you so, Padawan. - What's that? - Oh, that was my mom's actually. - No, what's that? Is that mari... Weed? - It's medicinal. You have a pen? - Yeah. Let's see. Here you go. - Uh, what do you got there? - Nothing. Oh, no, no, no, no, I can't do that. - Come on, Padawan. It's just pot. It'll loosen you up, you need to loosen up. - No. I can't get high. - Could you live with me? - Like in a house? - Could you live with me? Live in the now? Live in the now, man. Come on, hit it. Hit it! Trust me. No, no, no, no, no, come on. I know you've seen enough movies to know how this stuff works. Take another hit. Yeah, now suck it in. Swallow it. Swallow it. - Like... - Like swallow it into your lungs. There it is! - That's not for me. - Oh, no, it's for everybody. You're a natural. Are you alright? - Oh god. - There you go. - I miss my mom. - Me too. Me too. - Yeah, babe, sorry. I just, I can't tonight. I have so much homework I have to do, so I'm gonna stay home. Oh, no, that's just the TV. Okay, bye. - Hey. - Okay, out of the driveway. - Okay, okay. - And here she is at her high school graduation. You have her smile. Charlie, do you remember the speech Andrea gave that day? - Oh, oh yeah. She was very prolific with words. She was a genius. Brains and beauty. - That's where I get it from. - Oh, here's your mom and dad on their first trip together. - Certainly wasn't their last. - And, drum roll, here's your birth announcement. - I know that guy. - Yeah, that was a surprise. We didn't even know she was pregnant. - Grandfather didn't like my dad very much, did he? - Well, he just... He just wanted your mom around more. God, we miss her. - Well, hey, now you're stuck with me. - And I couldn't be happier. - Is that Han Zimmer? - What is that? - What's what? - Is that a video camera? - Maybe. Huh. No glasses, Padawan? - Oh, yeah, I tried contacts. I kind of avoided it for a long time. Anyway, I look stupid. - It looks good, man. - Does that have sound? It looks ancient. - Dude, this is a Super 8. This little thing is what revolutionized indie filmmaking. What do they teach you guys in school? - Not about Super 8. Stop! - Oh, you're so pretty. - Ew. - I gotta save film. - Where you going? - Uh, band practice. I mean, Kim's, but I have practice later. - Where's your instrument? - Kim's. - Left it at Kim's, my ass. ♪ You always got so much to say, baby, don't you? ♪ ♪ You ain't got nothing, talk too much ♪ ♪ You're good at saying something wrong ♪ ♪ I'm so moving on - What are you doing here? - You can't answer your phone? I called you like 10 times. - What are you doing here? - Thought we could hang out. - I can't. I have plans. - Oh. - Are you okay? - Okay, plans. Plans with who? - I have plans with Emma and Ella. - Oh, wow, okay, cool, yeah, whatever. - Is that alright? - Yeah, no, whatever. You just do whatever you want. - This is so awesome. I used to have a digital camera and I would film everything until Nick the dick came over one night doing god knows what to my sister. - See, you're a natural, Danny boy. All you gotta do is focus. - Look at Steve go. - Yeah, man, that's pretty frickin' cool. - This thing is awesome, man. I really wish I still had my camera. - Daniel-san. The Super 8 is yours. - What? - Hey! Under one condition. You can film whatever you want and if you have the instinct for a shot, always go for it. - But-- - Wait! Believe in yourself. - Yes, sensei. - Congratulations, Daniel-san. - Thanks, guys. - That was amazing. - No, that was nothing. - Nothing, my ass. That was pretty cool. - Thanks. - Steven, look at this camera Clarence got me. - Whoa, he gave you the-- - It's a Super 8! - Yeah, Daniel. - Isn't he adorable? - Yeah. We started hanging out all the time. It was really fun. Daniel used the Super 8 a lot. He decided he was a karate master, which was hilarious. Nick left us alone. I guess this is what it feels like to belong. I wasn't scared at school anymore. Clarence showed me his script, I showed him my music. I wouldn't trade this feeling for anything. - I don't know. - It's gonna be fine, man. It's BYOB, we brought our own. That's it, we're gonna be good. - Daniel, I don't know if this is gonna work. - Come on, Steven, it's fine. Talked to Kim, we're good. Let's go. - Look at you, Daniel-san, making moves. I like that. - Jesus! Are we not supposed to walk here? - Hi. - Hey. - Hey. - I thought you said it was just gonna be your brother. - It's fine, Richard. - What about these two and Nick? - They'll be fine. We will keep them apart. - Fine. - I'm gonna go find Nick. - Okay. - Hey, I brought booze. - Oh, good, yeah. - And Steven has pot. - Oh, thank god! I'm so glad somebody did because I was thinking it is so hard to find pot here and like I'm gonna be real honest, I just love a good joint after a day of stuff. - Sorry, gents, ladies. We got next. - You do? - You do? - We do? - We do. - Okay. - Ever played before, Padawan? - No. - Me neither. Can't be too hard, right? - Watch your step. - Hey! - Careful. - Oh look, it's little Stevie and his child bride. Aren't you a little worried about the whole statutory rape thing? - Is that what they're teaching you in boy band school? - Shut up. - That's my brother. - How long have you been waiting to say that? - Too long.

Gotta go work on the docks or something. Oh my god. - What? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, dude! My parents say they're coming home tonight and not tomorrow. They're gonna be here in like two hours! - Two hours, that's enough time to clean the house. - Hey, look, dude, that's fine, totally fine. Here's what we're gonna do. Look, there's five of us here, okay? We all just take a different area, we'll get it done before they come home. It's totally fine, dude, don't worry about it.

This is not what we agreed on. - But we didn't know what we were getting into, did we, Doris? We're not just talking about a couple of bucks here, we're talking about a whole lot of cash for anyone, let alone an 18 year old with a drug problem. - That is your grandson. And he's better now. For god's sakes, he lost both of his parents. - And we lost our daughter. You wanna see that happen again? - Clarence sick or something? - I don't know. I haven't heard from him in a while. - I'm sure the whole neighborhood heard from him last night. - What do you mean? - Well, I heard a loud car door slam around 2:00 a.m. Woke me up. I looked out the window and there he was firing up his car, which is not the quietest thing. Then he peeled down the street, blasting his music. - That's weird. - Yeah. So listen, if Clarence can't drive you home, you're gonna have to take the bus. - Do you have plans? - It's a little backed up at work. - Oh. What time do you think you'll be home? - I don't know, Steven. I'm not sure. - You sure you're okay? - Steven! I just got a lot of shit on my mind. Enough. - You know what day it is today? It's your son's birthday! Don't worry, Lieutenant, I'm not used to having one because the only person who did care killed herself. - Steven. Steven, wait. Damn it. Damn it! - And I'm sorry, Mrs. Philips, but there are consequences. Now I'll leave you be. - No, no! She's my baby girl! Not my baby girl! No! - Now you see, kids, this is a fine example of commitment. She believed in the circumstances no matter how far they are from her personal experience. Commitment, kids. Have a nice day. Reminder, in two weeks, we'll know which piece we're putting on for our final hurrah. We don't have to do Rent or West Side Story every year. - Mr. Tony? - Hey, Steven. Missed Clarence in class today. Everything okay? - Yeah. Well, no. I haven't talked to him since Saturday and he was supposed to drive me to school but then he didn't show. I don't know, I thought he would come to drama, it's his favorite class. - We certainly enjoy having him. He still owes me a piece of written material, you know? I personally would like to read something fresh. The best element I believe is-- - Surprise? Here. - Thank you. - Jack, it's good to see you. - You as well, Chief. I think it's about time for me to get back to work. - Well, Jack, that's great, I'm glad you're feeling better. But... - But what? - I... We feel that three weeks isn't enough time given your situation. - My situation? What do you mean? - Come on, Jack. We all see it. We can smell it on your breath. You look like shit. And I'm sorry, but we're not ready to reinstate you. Not yet. Maybe it's time to consider getting some help. - Help? What is that supposed to mean? - Treatment, Jack. Rehab. It's not required yet but for now, take some more time off. Go home and take care of yourself. If you need help, the department is here for you. Alright? - Yeah. - Sorry for the interruption, Chief. - What are you doing here? Did you have something, did he have something to do with this, Chief? - Jack, come on. - What do you mean, come on? Did you do this? - You're out of line! - Am I really? - No one had anything to do with this, this is just about you. Look, we all know it's been a rough few years but you gotta get back on track. Do that. - Hey. - Whoa, dude. Do you knock? - Sorry, your grandma let me in. What's going on? - What do you mean? - You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine, what's up? - Where have you been, man? - I've been... I just needed... I just needed a little space, man, just needed a little space. - Yeah, I get it, but like, you know, what about school? I thought we had plans today. For my birthday? - Shit, man. I'm sorry, man, come here. I'm sorry, Padawan. Happy birthday, man. It's my bad. - Um... Anyway, dude, okay, so much went down today. I was in drama, talking to Mr. Tony, you know, like about the spring play. And anyway, long story short, it gave me an awesome idea. Are you sure you're okay? - I'm fine, dude, I'm fine, I'm fine. What's up? Continue. What's up? - Okay. Anyway, I thought what if we... What if we do one of your plays? So I did. I pitched What's Eating Marco and he loved it. - You pitched Mr. Tony one of my plays? - Yeah, he really loved it. - My play. Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is? What do you... Who do you think you are, man? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Are you? Are you sorry? That's personal to me. You just thought you could pitch it to him? What? What did you think? What were you thinking? Huh? That wasn't your play to pitch! What were you even doing in my drama class? - I just-- - You just what? You just thought you could pitch one of my personal things to Mr. Tony? I gave that to you, man, not him! - Clarence, where did you get that? - Oh, no, no, no, don't try to flip this around on me, man. You messed up! - Wait, did you take those from my backpack? - Hey. - Hey, how many of those did you take? - Oh, how many? Are you worried, Steven, that you won't have enough for your big plan, huh? Are you worried? You think I don't know, huh? Take 'em. Finish the fucking job. Finish the job. Stop talking about it and finish it. - No, Clarence. This isn't you, man. - This isn't me, you don't know me! You don't know me, Steven! You don't know me! Take 'em. Get out. Get outta here! - Clarence. - Get out! Leave! ♪ Stay back, stay cool ♪ I'm just ♪ Breathing ♪ Nothing else to do - Well, look who came home. The little princess. Hey. Hey! So where have you been? You out there playing grab-ass with your boyfriend? Huh? Were you out there messing around with Turano's boy? Just like your mother! - You know why Mom left you? Because of this. You're an alcoholic piece of shit. - What you say to me, huh? Come here. You think I don't know what you're doing, hm? You and your little secrets, out there looking for your mama? Well, guess what? Your mama is gone. She left us. You know why? Because she didn't want a fairy for a son like you. You make me sick. - No. No, she doesn't want you. Okay? No one wants you. You're pathetic. You're pathetic! - You, you don't disrespect me. I stayed! You hear me? Nick, I stayed, she didn't! I did not leave. - Steven. Happy birthday. Take it. Come on. You're not gonna open it? Come on, please. - Thanks. You have to go back to work? - Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Look, I know it sounds like an excuse and it is, but you know, things are crazy right now. I'm sorry. - Okay. - Hey, you and Clarence do anything for your birthday? - No. He forgot too. - Everything alright with you? With us? - What do you think? - What do I think? No. No. I think no. I want to try to make it better between us. I'm really sorry that I forgot your birthday. And... I'm sorry that we never really had a chance to talk about your mom. - Dad, it's fine. - No, it's not. It really isn't. You need to know something. You need to know that your mother was the love of my life. Unfortunately, she wasn't well. Some days were worse than others, you know, and it really broke my heart to watch her, to see the woman I love fade away. There's no excuse for the despicable, selfish thing that I did. And there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about that or feel responsible for everything. And I need you to know that I'm sorry. - Dad, even when I was younger, I knew Mom wasn't well. And yeah. I spent a lot of time trying to find reasons why she did what she did, but... - But what? - But as I got older and started going through my life, I came... I got a better understanding of why, why someone would kill themselves. - What does that mean? - I'm tormented, Dad. Every day. By you or your mistakes or anyone else who wants to let something out. I'm the target and I hold my own. But there's only so much that I can take. - Steven. Oh geez. Steven. Steven, listen to me, okay? You're the only thing I have left. I promise you that I will do better. I will do better. What? - What are you doing in here? - Look, if you need anything, just let me know. - You have no right to be in here. - I know that. - Get out. - Nick, listen to me, okay? - Get out! - Okay, okay. - Steven. Hey. Steven. Padawan! - Okay, turn it off! Okay, turn it off. - So, Mr. Tony really liked the idea What's Eating Marco? Listen, man. I'm really sorry. I was just really missing my parents and I know it's no excuse but it all caught up to me, man. Yeah. I didn't mean anything I said. - You stole from me. - Steven, I... I have a problem. And I've been dealing with it for a while. It's really hard, you know, and I fell off. You're my first real friend, man, and I don't want to lose you too.

I do just want to put out some thanks. First of all, thank you to each and every one of you. I do also want to thank Mr. Tony, our very own. He had to dismantle his Bohemian backyard aesthetic just so we could see each other while we dance, so thank you Mr. Tony. Okay. Let's have a good time on the dance floor tonight, guys, that's all I ask. And let's reach for the stars. Let's kick it! Cue the music, DJ! One, two. - This is nice. - Yeah. - You look really pretty tonight. - You look really handsome. Nick! Is this ever going to end? What do you have against him? - I just like messing with him. Oh, come on, Steve, we go way back. Yeah? We used to be best friends, remember that? What happened? Huh? What happened? Tell them all what happened! - Perkins, that's enough! - I got it. - Hey, everyone, welcome to What's Eating Marco! It is an original play, directed by our very own Mr. Tony. It was written by our new student Clarence West and music is all original, done by our very own Steven Turano. Yes! So please put those cell phones on silent, please enjoy What's Eating Marco. Yay! - I know what you did. How could you? - It's my life and I had to make the decision on my own. I need to do what makes me happy. Marco! - You? - Me? - Oh, I can't with those eyes. Oh no. Why are you still with Sophia? - And how does that make you feel, Marco? - Not good, Doctor. - Why? - Sophia, I can trust her. But Ingrid, she's always been there for me. - Yes. - All I needed to do was listen. - Yes, yes. Sometimes listening is all it takes. - Maybe it's me who needs to do the listening, Doc. Maybe it's me. Who knew life in America would be so difficult? - You must be so proud of your son. - What's that? - Congratulations, Mr. Tony. - Well done. - Thank you, a lot of hard work. - Well, it showed. - I'm glad, yeah. Lot of good students. Oh, actually here's one of our students and leads of the play right here. Have you met? - No. - Jack Yahov. - Pardon me? - Jack Yahov. - It's a pleasure, Jack. Wonderful work. - Thank you. - Great job. - Nice meeting you too. Big fan of your grandson's. - So Steven, what do you feel about your first big play? - Well, Danny boy, you know, I felt pretty good. You know, I would have liked to have a little more time to rehearse it. I didn't get to practice with the band as much as I wanted but that's okay because everyone tried their hardest. You know, I just try not to screw it up, I guess. - What the hell, what are you doing? - Shut up. - Hey, hey, come on now. Whoa! - Got a gun! - Out of my way! - Hey, Nick? Hey, you don't have to do this, okay? - Steven, just shut up! - Nick, what are you doing? - Kim, shut up! Okay, this is all your fault. All of this. You and your cheating father. - No, Nick, I had nothing to do with that! - Steven, just stop talking. - Nick, Nick. Put the gun down. - No, no, no. You don't get to tell me what to do. No, that's not how this works. - Dude, calm down, alright? - Just shut up! - Whoa. Whoa. I'm sorry. - He didn't tell you, did he? - Nick, come on. Put the gun down, you don't have to do this. - Did he tell you what happened? My dad's dead, Steven. Dead just like your mom. And it's all his fault! - Nick, put the gun down. - Shut up! - You don't need to do this. - Shut up. - Daniel, run! - Steven! - No, no! - Um. Two weeks ago, my best friend sacrificed his own life to save me. But what you don't know is that it wasn't the first time. Dude, come on, my dad's gonna kill me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You fixed it? - Yep. Daniel-san told me it was your mom's and how important it was, so I knew I had to perform surgery. Oh, dude. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Her initials on it. ♪ It's merely shadows of sheltering clouds up above ♪ - I, um... On the first night of my senior year, I planned on taking my own life. That is, until I met Clarence West. - So what sparked your passion for writing? - Well, everyone has their own story. Some decide to share it, some don't. For me, it's all I have. Daniel, Daniel, I'm gonna drop him. I'm just kidding. Don't drop him, don't drop him. ♪ Trust, trust, trust, trust, trust ♪ - And I'll leave you with one more thing. Something Clarence used to say to me. Live for the now. And sensei, that's what I'm gonna do. Thank you. - That's a wrap, bitches. - Yeah, that's a wrap, bitches. - I'm so proud of you. - The truth is, Clarence taught me a lot that year. About courage, wisdom, forgiveness.
