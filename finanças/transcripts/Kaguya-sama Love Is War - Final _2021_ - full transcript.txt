It is Shinomiya Kaguya who made brilliant achievements in every aspect. The two of them are very popular at school I love more! Really love! arriving at a situation where no one wants to budge. Obviously I love more! Really love! Love! Love! Love! Love you lots! Me too. I Love you! Love!Love!Love! I really love ypu! Their battle for the student council throne has become very fierce. The result... ... Shirogane Miyuki wins the Election... ...and they're back together again. president, Coffee please. Thank you. Secretary - Fujiwara Chika Treasurer - Ishigami Yu shinomiya, the cup is a bit dirty, here. No, no. It's not dirty! This is Shinomiya's lip cream! It seems the president noticed right away, huh. That is, this is the coffee cup that Shinomiya used before! Did he take it wrong? Wait, If I drink this now, it's going to be an indirect kiss! Just one cup can make him panic like that. Apparently, you do like me, don't you. How cute. Wait. What did I do?! At this rate, won't I be like a pervert?! Those who always keep their words in the student council room. People who break school rules casually. Alright, stop it! Then, the woman who watches all of them, has reached her limit. Auditor - Iino Miko I can't wait anymore. Do you have any awareness as school representatives?! Take Ms. Fujiwara as an example! Uh? Uh? Uh? here. An-An-Anyway! The problem lies with the president who is supposed to be the role model! I? Just when I thought you were shaking your coffee... ...but the expression on your face instantly became very serious. Not very stable! I want to be the student council president someday. Hence, at that time... After the Election of Student Council President Such a playful election is invalid! Iino? Your acquaintance, Ishigami? Yes, we studied in the same school. Why are you suddenly like that? What's with that speech?! Didn't you two just say you both like each other carelessly?! What are you talking about? The words of "like" were addressed to the student council. Ndagukunda! (Kinyarwanda) "I really love you!" Yeah, what are you saying, anyway? Obicham te! (Bulgarian) "I love you!" Since the candidates are the two of you who are the school's role models, That's why I withdrew from the candidacy. Oh, I see. However, through such a boring speech, The school student president was chosen. Please repeat the selection! This time, I'm going with it! I don't mind. But, also be prepared for it because it is already challenging. I'll take it! Kaguya-san! Duh, isn't it really a pity, if you say like that? The kitten who likes the president as the most popular person in school, hated and despised by all, then abused. Finally dumped. The kitten that lost its shade picked up by a man in the middle of the night. Then, the two of them... On the creaking bed ... Stop it! Cute, pet, caress. Instantly tamed! In that case, why don't you just join the student council? president? If you want to be the student council president, you better study from now on. I welcome you. Uh? Since the president said so, That's why I entered the student council to study fully. However ... The president is always flirting with Shinomiya-san. Flirting?! Iino, I can't accept your words. Even though you two are dating, at least you have to choose the time and place! In a relationship? Are we flirting? In a relationship? It looks like that? Iino. If you keep protesting without thinking about other people's feelings, later no one will open his heart to listen to your words. Hey little kitten. Yes. If you keep protesting without thinking about other people's feelings, later no one will open his heart to listen to your words, right? As you said. Hey, hey, that is okay... The two of us are called Dating He's a good boy. Uh? Maybe Shinomiya has a crush on me. I think so. I like you! I like you! I like you! I really like you! Shirogane > Shinomiya The word like was very clear to me. But, is it "like" based on the emotion of love? Like or... ... Love? Which "like" is the one she meant? Ugh, you scared me. Brother what are you doing naked? I'm just thinking a bit about something. That's gross. Hurry up and put your clothes on. Sorry. Hey, Kei, What? This is just an allegory, but whay if... You give a cup of coffee that has your lip cream on it to someone you don't love, it doesn't mean you love that person, right? Hah? That's is just perverted person. Uh? Yes, it's just perverted person. Disgusting. Or, you are just treated like trash. Trash? What are you doing, dad? Just looking at me should be enough to already understand, right? Naked Director. He said, Dad started making content on Youtube. In order to earn money to gamble. Miyuki, try blowing the clams. No. What's this anyway? Stop recording it. Good too, yes. Since that day, I couldn't talk to the president while looking into his eyes. I like you! I like you! I like you! I like you! I really like you! The word like he said at that time was clearly for me. Definitely. Hayasaka Ai With just one push, The president will definitely profess his love for me. Yes, hurry up and push him. I can't. Why? Upon seeing the president's face, I remember his favorite words at that time, and my head is spinning. In that case ... Let's test regularly. Routine? Yes. This is one of the mental controls that sports athletes do. Of course, I know. Reset mental state with an action. It's a way to stay relaxed, right? Yes, Miss Kaguya will also do that. Miss will move the body and find the gesture that makes you most comfortable. The most comfortable gesture? Ichirou. Goromaru. Uchimura. Maybe this. This is the most comfortable. Okay. Look. This is your future husband. Okay, try to touch. How cute. shinomiya, taking out the trash? Yes, it's my turn. This is my chance! I'll make sure of this place! I'll make sure how Shinomiya feels! This is a plan to prove whether his feelings are like or love! Long, huh? Seems heavy, let me take it. If they come into contact with the person they like, humans will surely panic. If his face is blushing, he's definitely in love! Thank you very much. Not reacting?! So it's just like, huh. Yeah, Could it be, I'm... ...really just trash?! Hm. The current me has a routine. No one can guess the bottom of my heart. No, no. It can't be considered trash. Then... You are beautiful, yes. Damn! This is too deep a stomp! Whoever is called like this will be embarrassed! It's better if she doesn't blush... That is not true. Looking serious?! At this rate, I'll give you more piercing words, No, you're beautiful. Eyes, nose, lips. Although asked to choose any part, each piece is beautifully crafted like a French doll. It's bad, even though I have a routine, it will be dangerous if he continues to attack. Then... I also think the president is cool, really. Uh? And now she is replying back? Shit, I let my guard down. Shinomiya~ For those with high self-esteem, expressing love first is impossible. Then, with all your wits and abilities, they try to get their partner to confess their love. So Kyoko the thug? Love is a battlefield! Those who declare love will lose. It was the two of them who weaved this story. This is a love battle that puts their dignity on the line! Kaguya-sama: Love is War - Final A Week Until the 68th Game president Cheerleading - Kazeno Sports festivals are ridiculous things, aren't they? Sports festivals are important. Because every student will take responsibility and participate. Body and soul also develop. Then again, what exactly is that? Cheerleading is just a bunch of people who filled the streets and make ears ring. It's terrible. Ishigami hating youth fashion has started! When I see it like that, I feel cold. After all, even though they claim to be cheerleaders, don't they just want to stand out? Or you could say pretentious cool. Hey, Ishigami. Oh, seriously. Can they all just die? That's too bad.

The president also mingled among the herd, and with a girl other than me... Stop it! The president persisted in coming to the meeting, even though he already has me as his partner. Unforgivable!

You must accompany me until I am satisfied. Wait, stop it already. Then it's broken. I'm late. Oh, I'm relieved. After I get back from the toilet, we start the second half. Hayasaka! Miss Kaguya. What happened? What did the president do to you? sea ​​cucumbers. Sea cucumbers? What does that mean? president ... The president what?! Because it was too bad, my shaking wouldn't stop. Bad?

I've collected signatures from all the students. Please, have their expulsion from this school reconsidered! What a despicable method. But, new wind, huh? What we lack, perhaps ... The student council is slowly changing. Is the kind of student council I wanted to be part of! Imagination is indeed a good thing. But please include Ishigami in that story too. Just by thinking about it, my life is a waste! Why do you hate Ishigami so much? After committing such a violent incident, he had ended up as a human. Violent incident? All the first graders know it. That Ishigami is a terrible guy! Oh I see. That's why you need a women's uniform. Yes. I understand. If you like, I'll lend you my uniform. Uh? No problem?! My junior is having trouble. What can we do about it. Sis Shinomiya... Very amazing! Are you saying that because you know what it means? No. Because it's an ancient sentence, so it's better not to use it. Okay. More important, why did you decide to be a cheerleader? The president told me to give it a try. president? I said I'd rather die than do it. But, he said, if I was determined to die, then I could do anything. Shinomiya. The cheerleader thing was too heavy for Ishigami. Well, I... Did the president forget that incident? You worry too much, Shinomiya. You mean I was wrong? I didn't say that. Why are you so stubborn? Even though you lied by saying you joined the gathering. And enjoy the blind date. Well, that... You suck! Hey, Shinomiya. What's a gathering? Sports festival. This is a page of youth that is engraved as a childhood memory for everyone. Hey, hey, hey! Would you like to celebrate the sports festival?! Okay, okay, okay! Sweat dripping. The pounding of the chest overflowing. A man's passionate gaze. Ah! I can't! Really? Seriously?! The man who was transported. I was really looking forward to it though! In the midst of it all, this man is fighting alone. Is this okay? Fine, really. You're pretty good. The next event is Team Red vs Team White cheerleading. Please watch this blazing battle of cheers. Okay! Come on! Red Team, are you ready? Everyone, I've brought Ishigami! Cute, right? Doesn't he deserve to live? He can't read the mood, can he. Ishigami-kun! What's he doing, anyway? Sorry. Even though you already lent it. No problem. You've fought well so far. No, I feel bad for the president. Same president? Yes. Uh. You were forced to join, right? No. The president thought of me. Can they all just die? You suck. He always said that. He's approaching! Ishigami. Do you feel no problem if you live the rest of your school like this? Uh? If you stay in youth hate mode, I won't say anything. About that, I also... Oh I see? Then why don't you be a cheerleader? Hah? I would recommend to the their president. Wait! Kazeno! Is Kazeno there? Kazeno! Excuse me, Kazeno! Kazeno! Oi, are you all right, Shirogane? Excuse me.

In exchange for putting me in the cheerleading, The president had to go on a blind date. Turns out so, huh? I said cruel things to the president. Ishigami-kun! The president's leg was very sore, so it was impossible to join the relay. Then, he asks if you can replace him? Ishigami? Yes. That's impossible. In middle school, you ran fast, right? Next is the last event. This is the relay race you've been waiting for. Ishigami-kun? help! In a moment, the relay between teams will begin. Currently, the red team has 495 points. Then the white team gets 550 points. The white team is leading! However, the red team still has a chance to turn things around. Team white and Team red, fight to the end! Was the last runner Ishigami? Why did he do it? Cruel. They badmouthed Ishigami. It was his own fault. Because he caused the incident. Hmm? You all misunderstood Ishigami. The incident that happened during his junior high school wasn't his fault. Uh? Only me and the president know the truth. What does it mean? The president told me to shut up, anyway. Ishigami, who was labeled as a freak at the time, couldn't adapt to his class. Ishigami. Your eraser fell. The only one who is kind to Ishigami is Ootomo Kyoko. Thank you Ootomo Kyoko is a theater star and often participates in national competitions and he is dating Ogino Ko as the head of the theater extracurricular. Then one day, the incident happened. Stay cool. You see, Kyoko thinks of me as her boyfriend. After I put her to sleep, do whatever you want. What is it? You there, huh? then? What do you want to do? Want to be a cepu? Stop it. So it's a hassle, here. I promised too. Oh, yes. I have a good suggestion. You like Kyoko, right? Hah? Today, to my house, please. I'll call Kyoko. Then, after I put her to sleep, you can later... ... do whatever with her. What is Ootomo to you? Hmm? What is Ootomo to you?! No kidding! Don't joke with me! You, don't joke with me! Hey! Stop kidding me! Hey... If you get out of here, I won't mess with Kyoko. If you divulge it to other people, I'm going to spread Kyoko's nude photos on the Internet! What you're doing is stalking! Hah? Your feelings for Kyoko are well conveyed! But, despite being beaten repeatedly, I won't break up with him! What are you saying? Violence can't beat love, Ishigami. Everyone believed in Ogino's acting. - Oi, what are you doing? - Disgusting! - It's done - Rubbish! It's weird. It's weird, you know! Ootomo. The strange thing... ... you! That was the truth of the incident. Willing! Ready! The match starts! The lead of the white team. But ... ... why did you know that? Because I also saw the same scene. A year ago I'm the one who is treated special by the people around me, always feel lonely. Then, one day I met Ishigami. {\an8\i1}Sentences of Regret He doesn't seem to have submitted a letter of regret, president Shirogane. What is it? No, I just didn't think so. Shinomiya Kaguya turns out to have an interest in foreigners. I only ... ... a little interested. Okay. Then, want to investigate it together? You're Ishigami, huh? Yes. We've been trying to investigate what happened between you and Ogino back then. I'll take the doll first. Then, we asked his friend about it. This is the promised money. So, when can we play with Kyoko? Sorry, that didn't happen. Hah? Why? It's different from the talk, right? Yes, I do. That's the way it is, yes. Yes, right. You invited Kyoko to your house then you put it to sleep and it goes on like that, deh! A bunch of idiots told me everything. {\an8\i1}Ishigami Yu's Report You covered everything to protect Ootomo Kyoko. If you leaked it, you would have survived, but you didn't. That is the conclusion of our investigation. If protecting that secret is your fight, so we have no intention of telling this to anyone. In that case, a letter of regret that you have to write is this! Fool, you idiot! Fool, you idiot! You're great at surviving. The baton has been passed to the fourth runner. Both teams fought very fiercely. Spirit. The distance is getting wider. Fight the red team! I want to go home. I want to go home. Want to go home. The white team is very fast, currently ranked first! The last runner, please be prepared! lol? My headband? The tie is gone. Besides, I'm on the red team, right? Ishigami. Headbands come off easily if you don't tie them tightly, right? Don't pay attention to the views of those around you. Prove it. That you're not weird. Go. The runner is going to the last lap. In the end, the baton will be handed over to the last runner. That's right. I'm not weird. I'll prove it. I will prove it! First, Yamamoto. Go, Ishigami! Second, Ogawa. Third, Midori. Fourth, Ishigami. Fifth, Aoki. Sixth, Tanaka. Fight, Ishigami! Be the winner, red team! Ishigami, fight! Will the red team turn things around?! Ishigami, fight! The match cannot be known until the end! Ishigami has finally overtaken runner number three! Great, Ishigami! Hurry up! Come on! Spirit! Forward, Ishigami! Ishigami got second place! He is running incredibly fast! One more person! Go, Ishigami! One more person, Ishigami! Fight. Fight, Ishigami! Fight! The white team wins! Shit. Shit! Ishigami. Ishigami! Ishigami, That was so close, right?! Koyasu... Oh! Ishigami! You run so fast! That was so close. Okay! Red team! Very amazing! Very amazing! Very amazing. Ishigami amazing! president. I apologize. I have said bad things about your cheeleader idea. That's okay. More importantly, do you want to see it with me? Tonight, the moon is beautiful. No. I ... ... hate the moon. I guess in that place, some unfortunate man was brought home to the moon. It's about Princess Kaguya's story in the Heian period, isn't it? Yes. Poor guy, huh. I don't feel that way. Princess Kaguya's ending was like this. Before he was brought home to the Moon, she left the drug of immortality with her beloved man. Before returning to the Moon, take this. This is the medicine of immortality. Live long. However, since he had no intention of living long in a world without Kaguya, the man burned the medicine. The story is considered a moving fairy tale. Without knowing the hidden meaning of Kaguya's words, he's just a stupid man who burns the medicine to make the story feel moving. Hidden meaning? I've always thought this way. That medicine is a message from Princess Kaguya which reads: "Soon, pick me up." "Even though the time required exceeds the standard of human age, and though great distances lay between them, I will always wait for you." Princess Kaguya thought as she handed over the medicine. If. The president is that man. What will the president do? I definitely won't let Kaguya go. Oh, no... I will definitely chase him to the Moon and bring him back. I will definitely... Alright, stop it. Even if it takes tens to hundreds of years, I will definitely... I told you to stop it! I'm ashamed! Uh? Shinomiya? Why was she shy? I'm just talking about Kaguya. Kaguya? On target! Shinomiya! I ... ... said such a shameful thing! Parent and teacher meeting. Meeting discussing future dreams with parents, and decide on a career choice. I want to be Prime Minister in the future! Surprise! Reiwa! Excuse me. Hmm? Hmm? Fujiwara Chika, is straying from career discussions. How will Miss Kaguya answer later? I will only say what my father ordered. Shinomiya Kaguya, hopes to continue on to an internal university. president of the Student Council. Shirogane, You don't mind this, right? Yes! The choice of a future career can also be referred to as a farewell path. Miyuki. That time passed in an instant. So as not to regret, and if there is still something to be done, then you have no time to hesitate. Father. I'm really sorry about it now. Due to the meeting of parents and teachers, My father put off the coin game which was at its best. So that there will be no regrets, Dad is going to the gym. Give me 1000 yen. I don't have any. In that case ... here. Blow the clams for Daddy. No. Stop being a Youtuber. Stingy! The Festival of Giving Hearts! Shuchiin Private Academy cultural festival held in autumn every year. This year, the festival will also last for two days. And the students are busy preparing for it. See you, president! Oh, why are you two here?

Yes. If you give heart accessories at the festival, it says you will get eternal love! So romantic! he said some seniors gave heart-shaped gifts, expressed feelings, then they got married! I've heard that story several times. Wait. That means if I give this to the president... president. Giving a heart-shaped gift, huh? Oh I see. Means, you want to establish eternal love with me, yes. Don't! Anyway don't! This is too blunt! Uh? Kaguya. Do you have anyone you'd like to give a heart accessory to? Why ask that? No, apparently there is, yes. It turned out so. Miko-chan! Yes!

The Legend of the Festival of Giving Hearts, it is said that we can get eternal love if we give a heart-shaped gift. If you want to give it, it's the same as expressing love. But, at least you will find excuses when giving the gift and it doesn't mean you like- I like it. I ... ...liked Shirogane Miyuki. Is it time to part? (Heart Giving Festival) (First day) We will soon welcome a big event at our school, The Festival of Giving Hearts. The determinant of this festival... ... is manliness. Those are my words of encouragement. Hayasaka said this. If you like him, you have to confess your love to him honestly. Express love. Please, take it! Fujiwara's Secretary. What are you doing now? Oh, president! There are still a lot of heart-shaped balloons left. So, I distributed it to the class that lacked decorations! Apparently so. Nice thought. Ah? president himself?

He is nicknamed the Hand of God because he is an expert in performing heart bypass. With his hands, he has saved many lives. And he said this: Oh, that's right. It's me. Great right? Great, huh? Say great. What? So noisy. Well, it's me. While being the Hand of God on the world level, I am also known as a world-class coffee appraiser. Moreover, I am also in charge of handling the narrative of this film. At least you think, right? "Duh, definitely want to narrate again." At least you think the narrative is a disaster, right? God damn it, did you get that shocked? Hey. "Well, aren't you satisfied with being the narrator?" Surely you think so, right? Sorry to keep you waiting. Please. Okay. That's enough. Which one do you want? Is this the Shichiin coffee that is being talked about? Yes. Then, are the seeds made of ivory? who is at the Elephant Conservation Center in Thailand? I can record the order as coffee, right? Besides, does Miss know the etymology of coffee? No. Really troublesome! I want to quickly end and get away from him! In Arabic coffee is called Qahwa. Actually, the word Qahwa is the origin of the word coffee. Oh, I see. Your order... That qahwa... ... was originally also used as another name for low-calorie drinks. Then, the meaning of this Qahwa. is to reduce desire. president. Shinomiya, when you're not busy, can you talk for a minute? There is something important I want to discuss. Important?! Eh? Could it be... He wants to confess his love?! Shinomiya? Wow, noisy What's that important thing? I'm talking about coffee, here. So I don't care even if you want to discuss important matters. Cute... What's that? Important things to discuss? Oh, no. I think I should immediately confess... Eh? Here we go! He will confess! This ... Uh? {\an8\i1}(Congratulations on being accepted into SFIT) It's ... Shipped from America last week. It's an acceptance letter from SFIT. San Francisco Institute of Technology. Next year, I will leave Shuchiin sooner than you guys. What is that what you meant by "confess"? What does this mean? Yes. for me, this is my last cultural festival. Again, that's a sudden discussion, yes. That's a recommendation from the Principal. Last month, I took the no-risk selection. To be honest, I didn't expect it to be accepted either. I will continue my studies to SFIT. Oh, I see? That's very important. Congratulations. Thank you Is that all you wanted to confess? Yes. Then, I want to go back to work. Excuse me. Oh I see. The president wants to study abroad. Is it okay? How about trying to stop him from going? Don't say stupid. Even I also have trouble getting into SFIT. It's the top university in the world, you know. No matter what people said, he had to go there. When it comes to SFIT, there is a gathering place for geniuses around the world. His family background is also good. There must also be a blonde girl prettier and sexier than Miss Kaguya. Sexy blonde? I am really bored! Miyuki, play with me, please. How cute. In 4 years, he can have many girls, Many girls?! Je'taime "I love you" Te amo "I love you" Ti adoro "I love you so much" Obicham te "I love you" Ndagukunda "I really love you" I Love You "I love you" I love you, too. Then, he marries one of the women, and twins were born. There's already a third baby in her womb?! However, the president who had realized how enjoyable it was to change girls, Even though I already have a wife... Stop it. Help. Don't make my imagination run wild. Hayasaka. Please help me. Even though I told her about SFIT, Shinomiya didn't say about my confession or about confessing something... This way, I already know clearly. This is my loss. With that, the first day of the cultural festival ends. Then, the second day of the cultural festival will be held soon. Then, something moved. Seriously! Seriously! This is the case, lol! Big case! why you guys? All heart balloons for decoration are stolen! I have stolen these hearts. Arsene? This is Lupine! Kaitou Lupine! This is a challenge to me! I will definitely catch the culprit! Miko-chan! Yes! Because it's Fujiwara who usually messes up crime scenes, now enthusiastic about finding the culprit, then no one will stop me from making a statement. Maybe because of this disturbance the bonfire will be cancelled! Is there anything bothering you? Yes. It is nothing. Stay cool. No damage will occur. Besides that, doesn't the festival need a stir that can enliven the festival? Yes. I also agree. {\an8\i1}(Change room) It really doesn't matter, right? Yes. It's the perfect romantic situation. First of all, there will be ignition, right? Later, I will invite the president to be as close as possible to you. Miss Kaguya's face that was seen from the side and lit up with fiery arrows, will definitely look mysterious. At that moment, the president heart will start beating very fast for you. Beating very fast for me?! Then, while looking at the students enjoying the bonfire, and sipping hot coffee foreshadows the success of the cultural festival, you two will be in a peaceful mood. It's very emotional! Emotional! Then, a declaration of love. While giving a heart-shaped gift... Okay, Miss Kaguya. Try practicing the words declaration of love. Uh? If the president asked me out on a date, I would say, "Yeah, if you want to... I would date you then..." Wrong answer! What the hell is that? The slow reaction of a Tsundere girl? You see, you suddenly told me to express feelings. Because this is an important moment, so don't use other people's words. You have to express your love with your own words. Speak to yourself. What do you like about the president? Put that feeling honestly into words. As we walked as a group, and someone came out of the group, he must have turned around and checked. I like that side view of her face. Including the side that does not want to admit defeat. The president lost! Oh, I see. Then, I like his wry smile when you are in trouble. The president is bad in this game, huh! Happy. Kind side I also like his concern for juniors. Go. Then, most importantly. he trusts others. His candid figure, I like. I like it. Let's make this declaration of love a success. Sis Fujiwara! Miko-chan?! The perpetrator left a notification letter! (Notification Letter) (I will collect the following items) What time is this? Miko-chan! Yes! Let's go! Well! Detective Love, go! Can't wait to dance! I don't have a partner, here. Lie. Said he was just a childhood friend. Soon, there will be a bonfire. To all students. welcome to gather in the school yard. It's already started, huh! Wow, everyone here. Duh, what's he doing, anyway? Hayasaka? president still not found? Unfortunately, he's not in the student council room. What should we do? It's a plan to make the president flutter up close during the ignition, right? In that case, a bonfire event will be held! The person in charge of starting the fire is Shinomiya Kaguya as the Student Council Vice President. welcome. I can't wait any longer. Only one hour before the end of the cultural festival. I need to be able to confess my love before it ends! {\an8\i1}(I took the cultural festival) Another crime declaration? Ball! Ball! The ball is gone! Who's is doing these pranks? If you get bullied like this, there's no way I can confess my love! Look, there are shadows of people! Eh?! The Kaitou is still on the roof! Let's hurry! Come on! Kaitou! Miko-chan, you there! Well! Kaitou! Where are you? It seems that he managed to escape. Why are you so enthusiastic, Fujiwara? You see, Si Kaitou is waiting for me. It's inorganic paper. Inorganic? This is solid paper whose main material is magnesium, yes. Why did he bother using this paper? I also don't understand the meaning "I took the cultural festival." Full of mystery, yes. World clock! It's a different clock! This can actually be converted into the longitude of the earth! If 5 o'clock on the last notification can be called the yardstick, and the calculated numbers are applied to every hour... That means, the answer is found?! All mysteries are there to be solved! Sis Fujiwara is great! Let's go to the computer room and check the longitude! Miko-chan! Yes! Come on! Sorry. I apologize in advance. But thanks to Fujiwara, I've figured it all out. Directed? Yes. When I think by racking my brain. For example, this inorganic paper. Naturally, spreading paper over a bonfire is a dangerous thing, right? That's why he uses non-combustible paper? Then, this one is the same. I've been trying to think about it too but I can't even find a clue. In this case, there is one possibility that arises. There is no answer to this. From the start, this was no mystery. Uh? Bait for fishing girls who like solve mysteries like Fujiwara. If there were a bunch of marks, Fujiwara would have thought it was a code for an answer. He managed to lure people who love mystery. Thanks to that, the day went smoothly. Then, sender named Arsene. In Greek, it means masculinity. This is a word someone said. The determinant of this cultural festival is virility. This is president's mind reading game in order to find the president. president. Wait for me.

You're the one who's always aiming for the top. On top of the clock tower, The president is there. Why are you doing this? Why do you think? I don't know. Why are you here? Is it because you knew I was coming here? Am I being tested? What's your estimate? If I confess my love. What's your answer? How far are you aware of my feelings? How much do you like me? I don't know. I'm going to confess my love in a minute. But, I'm afraid to look into his eyes. What's wrong, Shinomiya? You've been quiet ever since. I do not know. Oh, I see. For me, this is the last cultural festival. For the last time, at least I'm willing to act out of control. Since you cornered Kaitou, so for the prize do you want me to do something? Or is there something you want? What do I want you to do to me? Yes. I want to always be by your side. I want you to confess your love to me. You must not know, right? If I ... ...I thought that life was just enduring painful things. When I see humans, I decide whether they can be used or not, and whether they can benefit me or not. Best wishes. But, I met you. And the scenery I saw changed. Best wishes. Best wishes. But, the more I realize your kindness, I hate myself even more. Because you are kind to everyone, then you will definitely be nice to me too. I misunderstood because I thought you favored me. Aren't I the only one smiling? When I thought that the declaration of love of my own free will could ruin our relationship so far, I'm shaking. That's why I want you to confess your love to me. Shinomiya, what are you doing? Sorry, I bothered you, huh. Hey, say something. Cold, huh? here. Sorry. I didn't mean to bother you. Shinomiya. There's something I want to show you. This is something I can't say. I want to give you the most beautiful gift I have planned. Uh? Do you understand it? Shinomiya. This is how I feel. Ultraromantic plan! This is a plan carefully prepared by Shirogane. Since the day he was accepted into SFIT, the plan has been executed. Excellent. On the night of the cultural festival, he wants to confirm his relationship with Shinomiya Kaguya. In order to achieve that, what should be done? And his inspiration is born from his daily life. Cosplay. Not bad. Balloon art. At that moment, a scene flashed in Shirogane's mind. Realizing this is quite difficult. If we don't get rid of Fujiwara, this thing can't even begin. The most powerful method to dampen his actions... Solving the mystery. 1, 5, 4, 1. Then all I need is a few hundred hearts. The Legend of the Heart-Giving Festival. Starting to see me. Put hundreds of hearts into jumbo balloons. Then suddenly exploded. He started making objects. Well then, what I need for the cover is... Help! Wow, romantic! bonfire! Hundreds of hearts floating from the balloon explosion, will go with the air current of the bonfire. Then, stop at a height of tens of meters. Then, the best time at the top of the school for a while was created. He is taking full advantage of the celebration of the cultural festival. Everything is for the sake of this situation. In a moment, I will make a once-in-a-lifetime request. Go to SFIT. Go to America with me. Sorry. Can't, huh? Regarding career choices, I was ordered to enter an internal university. I can't go against my father's words. Oh, I see. Goodbye, president. But this. This ... This is the immortality medicine for the president who will go far. I've always thought this way. That medicine is a message from Princess Kaguya which reads: "Soon, pick me up." I will always wait for you. Shinomiya. president, he said that if I catch Kaitou, there will be a reward, right? Oh yes. I guess I said so. Can I ask anything? Yes, as long as I can give. You already said it, yes. With that, the tumultuous cultural festival ended. Then, time passed in an instant. Seriously, time flies in an instant so it's shocking. Finally, the day of farewell has arrived. Normally, his feet should be able to tread. Sure you can. president! You're really going, aren't you? president! I am very grateful. Starting in the future, I will entrust the student council to you. Besides, the president seriously wants to go up like this? It's a freighter, right? Inside is a passenger seat, so it's not a problem. How long will it take? Approximately 2 weeks. Uh? If you take a plane it only takes 10 hours, right? As long as you can. I want to enjoy the boat trip. Said so... ... but have no money. Well, I was just joking. The end... ... to this day, Kaguya hasn't come back, has she. Where did he go, anyway? president. Did you really not do anything weird to Kaguya on the night of the cultural festival? Oh, no. I didn't do anything bad. In that case, why did she disappear? Exactly the day after the cultural festival, you know. And 4 months have passed. I will have to go soon. Take care of your health. Do you want to take that too? brought? Well, brought. Shinomiya. {\an8\i1}(San Francisco) {\an8\i1}San Francisco Institute of Technology SFIT here, yes. Shinomiya? Excuse me. Why is it written Shinomiya there? This is the result of the Deputy Chairperson's contribution. Vice president? OSIS Shinomiya. Huh, president. You're quite late, huh. Uh? Why? Why are you here? Why ask why? I'm also a student here. Hah? Didn't you disappear? I didn't disappear. Utra's plan is impatient! This is a plan that Shinomiya Kaguya has carefully prepared. Go to SFIT. Go to America with me. Since then, Kaguya's plan has started. Sorry. He didn't say yes right away, for aiming for the best results. Shinomiya didn't come to school? Yes. It seems she skipped classes today. She was completely unreachable. Because she disappeared in an instant, Shirogane's heart was shaken too. What she does behind the scenes is secretly entered SFIT. father. This was a once in a lifetime request from Shinomiya Kaguya. Feeling lonely because I want to meet you but can't. Evil act to increase love. Shinomiya... I'm leaving first. Goodbye. How was the preparation? Ready. Shinomiya. Good work. Shinomiya! A man trapped in despair. Shirogane's heart is breaking into pieces. On the other hand, Kaguya flew first, His secret actions managed to monopolize Shirogane's heart. Everything is done for today. I've prepared a chair for the president. Please. Ah. This is the new pure gold badge. Oh, I see. It turns out that you came to me that way. Is not it? You can't wait to see me, so you study abroad for me. What's always waiting? Please don't misunderstand. Because the president likes me so much, that's why he insisted on sending me here. Hah? What do you really like? I don't remember ever saying that! Doesn't it mean the same thing? If you have prepared that many heart balloons. You suddenly kissed me too, right? Aren't you the one who really likes me? No, it's the president who likes me so much. No, but you. president! Shinomiya! Well, if you really like it, say it out loud! Love is war. If you fall in love first, then you... Come on. then you... Sorry Staff, I can't speak English. Love is war. Defeat awaits the side who fell in love first. Even so, you still mention the Student Council President of the Shuchiin Private Academy? In that case, aren't you the Vice President? Seriously. Be clear! president? I love you. I love Shinomiya Kaguya. In this way, The battle of their two love ends. {\ an8 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Koi furu tsukiyo ni kimi omou {\ an8 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Can we be happy? {\ an8 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Darling Darling tonari de zutto {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Loving, More Loving waratteitai yo {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Bokura wa unmei ni sukoshi amaesugi ka na {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Darling Darling sono me ni zutto {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Feeling, More Feeling utsutteitai yo {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Itazura na kiseki wa {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} It suka Take us to the moon {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Majiwaru koi no jijou {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Karamaru shikou kairo {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Oh Yeah, Find the answer {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Kasanaru shisen wa Magic {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Takamaru Kiss furagu {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Oh Yes, It ’s a romance {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Kimi rashiku Kiss the sun {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Boku rashiku Kiss moonlight {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Mou nete mo samete mo (yume demo) {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Suki ga tomaranai (tomaranai) {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Koi furu tsukiyo ni kimi omou {\ an7 \ fad (200,200) \ blur0.198} Can we be happy?
