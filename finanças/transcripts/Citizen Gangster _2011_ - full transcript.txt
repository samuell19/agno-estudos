Mom, how come you don't drive a motorcycle anymore? Well, that was only during the war. You know, during the war, your father used to perform all the time with his friends. And he was in a band. He was a star. And do you have any of those photos? I have to finish the McLeans' laundry first. What are you drawing? A rainbow. A rainbow? Hey. Dad! You scared us. Yeah, I bet I did. - You didn't scare me. - Yeah, sure. Hey, you recognize the voice? - Yeah, it's you. - It is me. Why are you home early? Is everything all right? Nothing's wrong. Why does something have to be wrong? I got a guy to cover half my shift. It's the second time this month. Well, I wasn't gonna miss tonight. Look, don't worry so much. Come on. Come dance with me. Eddie, I've forgotten how to dance. - No, you haven't. - I have. Give me your hand. Like this. Remember? Yeah. What do you think of the record? Love it. You love it? You know who you sound like? What? Like Tony Bennett? Tony Bennett. That's just what I thought. You wish. # There is nothing for me but to love you # Happy birthday. Thank you. Hey. I know that one. We still got it. I think so. I think so. # Just the way you look # You know I didn't bring you here from England to live like this. I came for you, Edwin Boyd. We're not the only ones struggling. Let's go. - Happy Birthday! - Ta-da! Wow! Happy birthday. What a surprise. What shall I do? 'Kay, make a wish. - Make a wish? - Let's do it. One, two- you gonna help? Three. Tell us what you wished for. No, then it won't come true. Won't come true. It's true. Give her the gift. Is this for me? It's when we went to the lake. Yeah. Oh. Billy, I love it. What's that? That's the tunnel, and that's Dad doing his headstands. Oh, it is. Hey, come on. Open it up. You like it? Eddie, we can't- I had nothing to do with it. The kids bought it. Don't you like it? I love it, sweetie, but we can't. I'm gonna return this. No. Hey, you're not returning it. I got it on credit. Don't worry about it. - Credit? - Try it on. Yeah, try it on. At least for tonight. There you go. It's beautiful. Ta-da! It's so pretty, Mommy. I love pink. Well, sweetie, I'm just gonna take it off for now, because I don't want to get birthday cake all over it. But thank you. But there is still one more gift. There is? You're spoiling me. Did you make this? You made this? Carolyn and I. Aw. This is when your father played the count of Monte Cristo. Hey, how are ya? I know this is a little strange, but- Look, don't worry about it. How you want to do this? Soldier style? All right. Let's go. Here we go. Okay. Where you headed? Uh, just to Morse Street. Okay. Wow. So where did this happen? Dieppe. Thanks, man. Sure. Hey, you got a smoke? Oh. Yeah. Here you go. Need a light? Yeah. Here you go. Better be goin'. Hello, how are you? Thank you. I'm cold. Me too. We'll be home soon, okay? Thank you. I'll see you next week. Bye. Now, how were Mr. and Mrs. Got-Lots? Good. They're not worried about the bank taking their house, so... Can I help you? Yes. Hi, how are you? Hi, I'd like to speak to Mr. Greene, please. Oh, he's not here. I'm sorry. - Are you an actor? - Yes. Well, no. I'm not. But that's what I'd like to speak to Mr. Greene about, about getting some movie work. Oh, great. Your name? Uh, Edwin Alonzo Boyd. Alonzo. Yes, Alonzo. A-l-o-n-zed-o. "Zed-o." Performances, shows? Something we might have seen? Oh, uh, no, I, um- I lost some time overseas, so no. Oh. Yeah. Uh, well, look, I teach jujitsu. I... It's a martial art. Oh! You're athletic. Yes. I, uh-I sing. Mm-hmm. I can play the harmonica. Oh, musical. Well, yes, but I'm not sure musicals are really my thing. That's great, though. All right, the introductory course is $45. You fill this in and sign it. Bring it back with a che- Actually, I don't think you understand. I can't take a class. I'm-I have a family. I can't take classes. Well, um- Look, Mr. Greene and I, um, well, we had a little conversation. He was on my bus, and we had a little heart-to-heart. Gave me his card. Look, Mr. Boyd, I'm- Is he gonna be back in? Maybe I should just speak to him when he gets back in. No. Mr. Greene is in Los Angeles. He's shooting. I'm sorry. Glover. Lovely to see you. Oh! You didn't need to bring so much. Well, I couldn't have my grandkids go hungry. Besides, I got too many. Is he in? He's resting. I can wake him up. It's the afternoon. I know. He's tired. I heard people talk about this, um, combat fatigue. I don't know. Huh. He's been lazy all his life. The only good thing he's ever done was somehow convince you to marry him. And I don't know how the hell he did that. Must have told some good lies. You don't mean that. Please come in. I'll put the kettle on. I know he'd love to see you. No. I got things I gotta do. Get him to church. He needs to get his life straight. - Eddie, we're going shopping. - Bye, Dad! - Is this for real? - Sorry, I didn't understand. - I said I- I said I ain't foolin'. Fill it up quick. Do it quick. I don't want to use this. Just do it quick, quick and quiet. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, what good they ever done you, huh? That's good. - Everybody down! - Didn't know you were home. - I am. - What are you smiling about? - Eddie? - I got some takeout there too, if you're hungry. - Where'd you get the money for all this? I got an acting job. - An acting job? - Yeah, I did. It's nothing big, but yeah. I got a surprise for you. You gotta cover your eyes. - That's what this is for? Is that what this is for? What are you playing? What is it? You're not going to tell me? - No, I'm not going to tell you. - Why? - 'Cause it's a surprise. Cover your eyes. The other way. - What? - Okay, come on. - Is it a play? - No, it's just local entertainment. It's nothing special. All right, come on. Keep 'em covered. Keepin' 'em covered? - They're covered. - No peeking. Watch your step. There you go. There you go. - Don't let me slip. Hold there. Hold there. No peeking. All right, open up. Huh? We traded up for a little extra. - Eddie, have you lost your mind? - Well, I don't know. - It's beautiful, but- Have they paid you already? - Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come look. - Eddie! Promise me! - I promise you. I promise. I promise. - Oh, my God! - Get in. - You're nuts. - I like it when you smile. - Oh, my God. - Now you can quit your job too. - Are you serious? - I'm serious. - Gotta pack him up. - I'll get you. - You can't get me. - Yeah? I'm pretty sure I could. - I bet you could. - But I won't. - So I told your father. - Oh, Doreen, why'd you tell my dad? - Dad, stop moving. - Sorry, sorry. - I think he should know that we're doing good. He should know. - Okay. - Why don't you tell us about your work? - What do you mean? - The people you work with, who are they? Why don't you let us come visit you? - Doreen, I told you. I got a bit part. It's not like I can just bring anyone I want down to the set. - Oh, anyone? - Yeah, well, it doesn't work like that. - Dad! - Sorry. - Carolyn, pack in his legs. He's not going anywhere. Well, I think there's a reason why. - Oh, yeah? What's the reason? - I think maybe you don't want them to know that you're married. Doreen "The Babe of Brighton" Thompson. Hot Wheels! - No! No, Eddie! - Hot Wheels! Worried about me? Nothing to worry about. - Yeah? - Nothing to worry about. - Promise? - I promise. - What does it feel like? - What does what feel like? - You know, when you're... acting. - I feel... I feel alive. - I haven't seen you smile in forever. - # That's me # # The devil won't let me be # - Hello, ladies. How are ya? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Right where I can see you. You too. You too.

The search for a defense in the new age of warfare. 1950, the fateful year. Toronto the good? Look again. The serene calm of our city has been shattered by the depravity of a gunman wearing face paint. After eight terrifying heists, where and when will he strike again? But hope is on the horizon. Mayor Lamport has marshaled our own Sherlock Holmes to the trail: Detective David Rhys, a highly decorated soldier. Will he catch the man hiding behind the makeup? - He has struck once again. Police suspect that it's the same mystery man that's been on a defiant robbing spree... - Where does he live? Stay tuned for more when we come back. - Authorities, who have not seen anything quite like this before. The bank has yet to disclose the amount of money taken. The mayor will be holding a press conference at City Hall in just a moment. Never before has there been- You're home early. - Why are you wearing my makeup? Eddie, why are you wearing my makeup? - Come sit down. Let me explain. - Eddie, what's happening? What's going on? - Doreen- - Why are you wearing my makeup, Eddie? Oh. - We needed the money. - Mom? - Billy, don't come in! - Hey. - Mom, where's my baseball? - It's on the kitchen table where you left it! Hey. It's all right. It's okay. - Oh, Eddie. Oh, God. - Look. - Why? - We don't need to worry anymore. - Did you even think about the children? - Of course I thought about the children. - What if you got hurt, Eddie? - I'm not going to get hurt. - Listen, a few more jobs, and that's it. I'm done. We'll have enough. - Enough? - Yeah, enough. Enough of this. We need to start over. We need to start fresh, somewhere far away, somewhere warm. Can you imagine that? Fruit trees in your garden all year long and no more worries, imagine that. Imagine that. We are close. We can go get that. - What about this? - Grease paint? - What's it for? - It's a disguise. - Disguise? What would you do all day when you told us you were acting, hmm? - I go to the gym. I go to the movies. - And when would you do this? When would you do this? - When you took the kids shopping. - Thank you. - You know, some think you're crazy. - I'm not crazy. The world is crazy. I'm only its mirror. Your bank should share the wealth a little bit. Excuse me, ladies. Give 'em what they want; they deserve it. - Or what? - Or I'll keep comin' back. - Put the gun down! - Is he cuffed? - Yeah. - Is this a souvenir? Souvenirs should stay souvenirs. What's your name? - You're a cop, right? You figure it out. - Okay. You made my wife a happy woman. Is she a fan? - No. I'll get home early for a change. - Mr. Boyd. Mr. Boyd, one for The Daily Star? It's for the front page. That's it. Just hold. Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait for it. Just, uh, come a little closer, would you, Mr. Boyd? Talked to your neighbors. They said you were a decent family man, had a good job. You're a decorated soldier. What went wrong? - Things were wrong long before me. What, you guys don't read the papers? Life's way too short. It was time to start living. So I did. - All right, remember what the warden said. Couple of shots in and out. That's it. - So now what, huh? Now what? You sorry? - Am I sorry? Yeah, I'm sorry the cops got all my money. I worked hard for that. - You got any words for your readers? - Yeah, find a job you love. - All right, that's it. Let's go. - Hi. Hi. What are you thinking, bringing the kids here? - What was I thinking? - Yeah. - They had to be taken out of school, and there's no one to look after them. What was I supposed to do? Why on earth did you say what you said in the papers? - Hey, how are you? You okay? You guys all right? - The other kids aren't allowed to play with us anymore. - When are you coming back? - I don't know, kiddo. - I tried to get you a good lawyer, spoke to your father- - No, no, no, no, we don't need him. - He said he's gonna help us with some money. - How's he gonna help us on a cop's pension? Where's he gonna get the money? Doreen, I don't need the guilt, okay? - Well, we need him, Eddie. They've got everything. I can't even get my old job back. Nobody trusts us. - Hey, candy. Don't turn your back on me. - Whoa, tough guy. - Where you goin'? Where you goin'? - Go, go, go, go! - This is where I break your fuckin' neck. Whoa! Whoa! Big bad boy, no? - Dogs. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, I'm on your team. - You ugly fuckin' dog, get back to your fuckin' doghouse. Get back to your fuckin' doghouse. - Come on; it was a good fight. - Are you fuckin' feelin' doggy, huh? What the fuck do you want, huh? Get the fuck outta here. Get the fuck outta here. Walk. You gonna make me fuckin' come out here? - I'll fuckin' walk when I want to walk. - Walk! - My fuckin' block. - Why you always gotta start stuff, Willy? Thanks, Lenny. I'm sorry, man. - Steve? How you doin', Fred? This one's for Willy. So I heard you used a German Luger. Is that true? Okay, well, I, uh- I prefer machine guns. You know, quick, to the point, scares the shit out of people. You know, you're not the only bank robber in this joint. You know that, right? - He's in the papers too. That's Tough Lenny Jackson. - That furry little pervert, that's Willy "the Clown" Jackson. No relation, thank Christ. - Take it easy. - So I heard you served. - Yeah, I did. - Me too. Spent, uh, five years over there. Whole time I was over there, not a scratch, not a mark, you know? I come back over here, and no loss. Rode the rails. Cut clean. Kind of ironic, huh, after dodging all those goddamn bullets and- Yeah. You got kids, right? Yeah. I got one on the way. - His girl's a model, Sears, real nice. You should show him a picture. - Willy, shut the fuck up. Hey, I told you you're not allowed to talk about her. You're not allowed to even think about her, right? - Just sayin'. She's real nice. - Let's get to the point. Look, Ed. I didn't fight five fuckin' years over there to rot in this hell hole, you know? A man is master of his own destiny, right? - Me and Lenny already cut through one bar. It's Russian metal. It's like butter. It's held together by some soap and dirt. - So what do you say, movie star? You want to get the hell outta here? - So whose car is this anyway? Hmm? Why won't you tell me, hmm? Is it your girlfriend's? - Ah! - I thought Polish people were poor. - Her parents bought it for her. That's what Polish families do. - Yeah? Well, forget Poland. - Oh, shit! They're gonna be waiting. # # - # No amount of talk could cover up # # What I had hiding in my trunk # # Oh, baby, it will bring you down # - Let's go. - Mary, you're gonna have to get out. There's a streetcar stop on the corner. - Yeah. You're not serious. - No, really. I hate to do this. - Why can't I go with you? - Because Lenny would kill me if I took his sister to a breakout, Mary. Come on! I've gotta go! - Fuck you, Val. - Look, I'll see you back- - # No, I ain't sorry for what I did # # 'Cause for them, it's more of a business # # Than a punishment # - Where is he, Lenny? - I don't know where the fuck he is. - We gotta fucking go.

Everything's gonna be okay. - No, you-do you know me? You know me. - You know me. - Thanks, baby. - Now what are we gonna do? We gonna sit around here doing nothin' all night or what? - This just in. Authorities from Don Jail have reported a- - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Shut up. - There is speculation that Edwin Boyd, knew fellow inmate Leonard Jackson. Both are war vets and shared a cell block for the last month. - I gotta go. I'll call you back. - It's okay. - What the fuck is that? - Come on, Lenny, please. - What do you expect? He's in the papers. - Shut the fuck up. - Hey, hey, hey! Lenny! We know who got us out. You got us out. We know that. We know you got us out. - Turn that fucking thing off. - Yeah, turn it off. Turn it off. - Shut it off! - It's just a name, Lenny. Hey, you want to split up right now, I don't give a shit! You want to split up right now- hey, hey, hey, hey. I lost a lot of money doing those banks by myself. I lost a lot of money. I'm damn sure your take wasn't any different. Come here. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Now's your chance to say somethin'. Let's hit tomorrow. - He wants to hit tomorrow. - Tomorrow. - That's fucking smart, right? - I know a place. I hit it once already. With you, it'll be easy. I say we do it! - He says we do it! He says we do it! - Jesus Christ. What are we gonna do for guns, huh? What are we gonna do for guns? - We'll get guns. - We'll get the guns. - Right? We'll get the guns. - We'll get the guns. - Tonight let's have some fun. Hey, Val. Play something upbeat. - Play something upbeat. - Val, can you play something really sweet? - All right. - Why can't you shut the fuck up when I tell you to shut the fuck up, huh? - # I must admit, I can't explain # # Any of these thoughts racing through my brain # # It's true # # Baby, I'm howlin' for you # - All right, everybody, this is a holdup! - Hands up.

Let's go! - Willy, get in the fucking car! - # Catcher's mitt, strike two # - Come on, kid. Get out. - What the fuck is with that jumping shit? Go, go, go, go, go! - "Unbelievable" and "unstoppable" seem to be the only words to describe the Boyd Gang, who boldly robbed a bank today. - # Da da # # Da da da-da da, da da da-da da # - Boyd. I don't know what you're out to prove, but you dial it down, okay? I'm not trying to prove anything, man. I'm just doing what I do, okay? - Watch it. - Hey!

You know, they're good. - What if someone calls the police? - No one's gonna call the police. We booked the whole thing. Lenny knows the guy. He's gettin' paid a fortune. You gotta try and relax. You remember this song? Dancing away by the piano? I still remember those moves, the way you smiled at me. Mess Hall was the place, wasn't it, with all of them, our first afternoon together. Remember that? Stayed in bed all day. Met on a Friday, married on a Tuesday. Come here. - Oh, Eddie. Let's go. Let's us get out of here. - We're not getting out of here. We gotta start thinking differently now. You gotta accept that. With more guys, I can hit bigger banks, better banks. A few more jobs, and everything changes for us. - I'm scared, Eddie. I'm scared for the kids. I'm scared for us. You just got out of jail. - Yeah, and now I'm not. Now I'm not. That's why you gotta stop doubting me all the time. You're startin' to sound like my fuckin' father. I'm fixing things. You gotta start believin' in me. - You're waking the kids. - # Down went the gunner # # A bullet was his fate # # Down went the gunner and then the gunner's mate # - Oh, you're very welcome. - # Up jumped the pilot and gave the boys a look # both: # And manned the gun himself # # As he laid aside the book, shouting # # Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition # # Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition # # And we'll all stay free # - I wanted to go over there so bad... Fight side by side like you guys, wear that uniform. I told them. I told them, "I want to fight for my country." But I had pimples all over my face. I was 1 5. I couldn't hide it. - Maybe that's why God gave you acne. - But I didn't know they didn't let you fight if you had pimples. - It's not the pimples. - Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. Um, can I have your attention, please? - Shh. - I got something that I- that I found. I'd like to read it to you. You ready? Um... "If your beloved has the life of a fire, step in now and burn along." - Oh, my God, that is so sweet! - I thought you'd understand. Yeah? - And I will, Lenny. - And you're all invited to the wedding! Wait, wait, wait. Where are we doing this? - Montreal. The French won't know us in Montreal. Montreal. - Montreal is romantic. - Hey, to Lenny and Ann! Hey, guys, live happy. Live happy. - Hey, Billy, you want to come help with the next tray? - Yeah, sure. - All right, come on in. All right. This- okay, buddy. When this gets here, you tell me, all right? - Okay. - All right. Now, see what she's doing? Soak it up, and after you soak it up, you crunch it all up, okay? - Okay. - All right, and keep lookin' at this, though, all right? I got breakfast goin'. What do you guys want? I got pancakes, and I got eggs. - I want eggs boiled soft, the way Mommy makes them. And coffee too. - Coffee? All right, I don't know about coffee. We'll see. - Eddie? - It's okay. Everything's fine. All right, kids, get ready to watch your dad. Ready? What do we think here? Two at a time? - Whoo-hoo! - Yo! - One more. - Whoa! - Shit. - Eddie? - Shit! Fuck. - Eddie? What's going on? - You are both ex-soldiers. Has that factored into your investigation? - I'm treating this like I would any other criminal case. - In your memory, has there ever been this kind of media coverage? - I think there has been unwarranted sensationalism around these crimes. - Some are saying they're in Cuba living the high life. What do you think? - We've sealed the borders. I can assure you we're closing in on Eddie Boyd and his gang. - Those are the words of Detective David Rhys. Eddie Boyd:folk hero or just plain thief? - Always knew you wouldn't stay blue. You were a good kid to train, eh? - Thanks. No. - How's the family? - Got a third on the way. Welcoming it, but that's gonna be it. No more. - The situation is bad, eh? - He can't go on. He's got to come in. - I don't know where he is. We don't speak. We don't- - Where do you think he might be... or might do? - I-I don't know. I don't know who he is. But... he's still my boy. And, uh- - Billy? Eat your breakfast. - Willy. Stop it, all right? - I can't believe he's on the phone. - It's about time. - Okay. I'm ready. - And? - She had a boy. - All right, can we do this now? - Get down on the ground! Get on the ground! - Okay, everyone! Your attention, please. Hi. How are ya? Hey, fill it up. There you go. There you go. There you go. Faster. - # Everyone you... # - Hello, everybody! Welcome to the show. We are... the Boyd Gang. Please, everybody in the center. In the center, in the center. Please, sir. Thank you. - Eddie, what the fuck are you doing? Hurry up! Come on! - # A woman long ago # # A mother just like yours # - This just in. The Boyd Gang's largest bank haul yet. - The biggest heist in the nation's history. - It's already on the radio! - There's my girl! Yeah! - I got you a little money, honey. - All right, you two, let's get you to Montreal and get you married. - Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I gotta bless you for your trip. - You're not coming? - I can't. Doreen wants me to stay. I gotta stay. Our father who aren't in heaven, hallowed is thy name. Thy kingdom is none. Thy will is done. - Hallelujah, Boyd, but you know what? You're comin' with us to Montreal! He's coming with us! - # Haven't you noticed more cops? # # I'm scared, 'cause no one else around me seems scared # # I'd buy a gun and be prepared # - What are you doing? - This is what we used to do back home during the war. If anyone wants to come in, they can't. - No, I- I understand. I was just a fuck. So now it's time to settle down and do what's right? Fuck. Wow, that fucking bitch gets herself pregnant. Oh, my God! But your parents must be so happy. I should've never have told you I couldn't- - Shh. You know it's not like that. - Fuck you. You know what? You can't quit, because you're a fucking dumb-ass doorman. You know that? Fuck you. - Hey, it's me. Please don't hang up. Doreen, don't hang up. Look, I couldn't get out of it. Those guys look to me. - So do your family. - Listen, Doreen, when I get back, we're going to get a nice place. It's got a big backyard. I already got Mary working on it. I was keeping it a surprise for you and the kids. - Eddie, do you remember London, my room? Do you remember what you would say to me when I couldn't sleep, when you were holding onto me? You remember? Those bombs were falling, and I couldn't sleep. They were really good things to think about. Your dreams. You made them ours. And I believed you. I didn't think it would be like this, Eddie. - Mary Mitchell. Haven't seen you in a while. - I can't even go five steps without seeing your face. I mean, you're the cop in all the papers. What is that like? - You didn't come here to talk about me, did you? - There you go. Just how you like it. - Sure the schools are great here, Eddie. Hmm? We should enroll them. Hmm? Perhaps we should throw a dinner party as well for all our old friends. We haven't seen them for so long. They'd love this place. - Doreen, don't be like that, okay? Don't be like that? - Yeah, don't be like that! - Well, I'm sorry that I'm not jumping for joy, Eddie. This place isn't great, and I'm not great, because things aren't fucking great. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't speak like your new buddies? Don't look at me like that. You want some more? Your father, he warned me about my life with you. He told me, and I didn't fucking believe it. - That's great; now you sound like the cesspool you came from. That's wonderful! - I'm leaving you, Eddie. - You're leaving? - I'm taking the kids, and I'm leaving. - Well, that's just fucking great! Who do you think I'm doing this for? This is for you! All of this is for you! - I don't want this! - You don't want this? You don't want this life? You don't want the got-lots life, huh? You don't want the house? Fine. It's gone! It's gone!

We're gone. We're gonna go. We're gonna go as soon as we can. - Hello? - Rhys took me to the police station. I mean, he kept on asking about you and where you were and if you were with Boyd. But, I mean, I said I didn't even know. I couldn't even care less where you were, I said, since you didn't bother to reach me or nothin'. That's when he started to hurt me. - Son of a bitch. - I mean, it hurt so much, but I had to give him something so he'd stop, so I told him some guys were smuggling cigarettes up from the States. - What guys? - I made it up. I mean, I had to give him something. And I told him about the car. - What car? - And that's why you can't go there anymore. - Go where? - The house, 'cause that's where Rhys thinks they're hiding everything. - What house? - Val, they don't even know who you are. - Mary, what house? - Her house. - Oh, God, Mary, you didn't! - Well, come on! Don't you see? He was hurting me. Val, look! He-he-he burnt me. He burnt me. But you know what, Lenny? I fixed it. So as long as Val doesn't go there anymore, it's fine. Lenny, please, please don't. Lenny, please! - Listen to me! Listen! Please. I don't want you to go. - I'm gonna take care of it, okay? - Please. Lenny, please. Val, please! No! - Jesus. Val, come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Hurry up. - Oh, God. Oh, God! Help! - Ann. Hi, baby. Look, um, Val and me, we gotta get out of town for a little bit. Just a little bit. Uh-huh. - Fiona. Just wire some money. Fiona, please. I just- I can't come home right now. - Step one, step two. - # Two by two is better for you # # It's better for me, 'cause I'm with you # # Better than one is two for fun # # Two is more, is better for me # Hey! Hey! - At this time, police are unable to confirm whether Edwin Alonzo Boyd, Ieader of the notorious Boyd Gang, was involved. Speculation continues as to why Jackson and Kozak... - How 'bout a plane? I've never been on a plane. - No, we're gonna drive so we can camp, remember? Daddy just needs to find a new car first. Mary's not answering. - So we stay here then? - Yeah, for now. - We're gonna need more food, Eddie. - Yeah. - Hey. Ann. Oh, everything's fine. - Lenny, talk to me. Please. Lenny? Lenny! Lenny! No! No! - The notorious fugitive Edwin Alonzo Boyd has been captured in a strategic police operation. - The mayor moved everybody else out. They want to bring us all in court together. And they took away Lenny's foot. This is bad, eh? Now what? - Eddie. They're gonna kill us, Eddie. I know. They're gonna kill us. I- We did what was right. I- - Val. - You gotta do something, Eddie. You gotta- - Val! They're not gonna let us just sit here until we're shitting ourselves hanging from a rope, okay? We're gonna figure this out. Eddie? Me and you, we can figure this out, no? Need to see my kid... - I got it. I got it. I got it. - How are they treating you? - Wonderful. - Now that you're famous, not quite like you expected, I bet, eh? - What's with the getup? - I've just been to a friend's funeral. But, you know, once a cop, always a cop. - That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. So I guess this makes you happy, huh? - Why would I be happy? You're going to need a lot of help to get your sentence reduced. Still, I- A father can still help his son, can't he? You'd help your son, wouldn't you? What do you think this is doing to your kids, son? I always warned your mother you'd end up like this. - Don't lose your faith. - You okay? - Hey, Willy. - Yeah? - What's it say in the paper? - About lndia? - No, about the TV. - It says here, "Our nation will launch "a TV network of its own with Mr. Lorne Greene anchoring." - When? You all right? You okay? - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Hey, come on. Let's share that leg. We got a long way to go. - I'm all right. - Come on, let's go. Don't be a tough guy. Come on. Let's go. - Fuck. Let's fucking go! - Good evening. This is Lorne Greene. This week, our cameramen all over the world went to get the news where and when it was happening. Here is what we've selected from the pictures they took. Our first story... a story of a manhunt. The Don Jail. This is where it began. Monday morning, the call went out to the police dispatcher at headquarters on College Street. In matter-of-fact tones, he told the unbelievable story. Four men escaped from the Toronto jail. These men are dangerous. Within hours, 2,000 police had begun the hunt, and the unofficial word was, "Shoot to kill." - There's supposed to be more. - Is my foot in there? - There's nothing here! I can't believe this! - Why? - He's your guy! - Will, where's my fuckin' foot? - Fuck. - The Boyd Gang's dramatic second and unprecedented escape from the Don Jail has ignited the largest manhunt in the nation's history. Guards at the Don Jail are being questioned for their involvement. One has been suspended under suspicion. Sightings of the Boyd Gang are coming in from all over the country, confounding authorities. Police have closed the borders, speculating that the Boyd Gang will attempt to flee the country. Banks are adding extra security for fear of being the Boyd Gang's target. The public is to be reminded that these men are dangerous. Two are cop killers. - How long we gonna wait for this guy, huh? - We'll wait one more day. - All you gotta do is read it. Are we ready then? - "My dearest Eddie. "Am I asking too much, under the circumstances, "for you to give yourself up? "I've thought this over so much in the past few days, "and knowing me as your devoted wife, "I will wait for you "no matter what the outcome may be. "God willing, we'll have the privilege "of growing old together. "It's all I ask of you. And remember always I love you." Eddie. Come back. Come back now, Eddie. Come back, Eddie. - This brings to a close our special broadcast. Mrs. Doreen Boyd is now being escorted by police from the studio. Her children are being led to her by other officers. Reporters are waiting outside. - Turn off the radio. - There is speculation here and elsewhere as to- - Car 20 on scene, 1 854. - Snow removal crew reported suspicious men around abandoned barn. - Come on. - Lenny, come on. - Go! - No, come on! - Just go! - Leonard Jackson and Valentine Kozak have been sentenced to death by hanging for the murder of Detective Rhys.

Think that'd be okay? - Out west? - Yeah, they're gonna send me away, so they're gonna send me away. - They didn't say that in the papers. - Yeah. I was kind of hopin' the kids might come visit me. I was kind of hoping you'd come out with me. - Come out with you? I mean, I don't mean right now. Hey, Doreen, I don't mean right now. I don't mean right now.
