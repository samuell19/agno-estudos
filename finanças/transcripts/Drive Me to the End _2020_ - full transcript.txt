Cassy is very protective of her because of her... Whoa, what's Cassy? Cassandra, Jason's ex. I left you a post-it-note. A post-it-note, where? Right, okay, start from the beginning. You're taking her daughter, Sunny, to the funeral. You're driving up together. Ryan. No fucking way. Ryan. Mom, I don't even know who Cassandra is, let alone her daughter and also this is supposed to be a solo trip, that's why I'm leaving a day early. That's kinda the point. Jason's ex-wife. Who's Jason? What, aunty Sue's son Jason, aunty Sue's. Look, I used to do pilates with Cassy and she asked me to do it. It's a two day journey to Thurso. It's miles away, it's in bloody Scotland, and Cassandra is so protective of Sunny, she wouldn't be comfortablewith her going with anyone else. And she trusts me and I trust you. You're doing this. I raised a gentleman. [coughs] Mom, I don't know her, it will be awkward. You're a very easy-to-talk-to young man. [moans] You're affable. [moans] [laughs] Fine, fine. Just text me her address, don't post me a bloody post-it-note. Thank you, take your coat. - Oh, mom, it's hot. - Ryan. I love you. Love you. [mouth smacking] Delicious. See you, mom. [sighing] [upbeat acoustic music] I'm not letting my daughter go to Scotland on her own. What are you thinking? Our daughter, and she won't be on her own, he's a good boy. Okay, he's a man. And how do you know what he's like? I met him once, he was five at the time. What if he mistreats her, Cass? Jason, stop, he's family. Is he, is he though? Listen, this is hard for me as well, we have to put our differences aside and I think it might be good for us to loosen the leash a bit. She can't look after herself, Cassy. She won't be by herself, Jason. [groaning] You know why I'm letting this happen. I can't... I can't have another incident. It tore you and me apart and I don't want to lose her as well.

It's ah, hey, in a minute, we could stop for some ice cream. Ice cream. My favorite flavor is mint chocolate chip. It's... Oh, that's rank. So how are we related then? What, we're cousins or? No. Are you Australian? Yes. Why are you Australian? Because I'm Australian. My mom's your mom's sister's ex husband's ex wife. Oh, okay, so that makes me, so what we're like second cousins twice removed? Or are we even related? No, that would make me your ex, ex, cousin-in-law. Oh, small world.

Come on, man, it's a two day journey, just give me something, anything. I just, I'm... Art. Art, art, okay. Okay, art, cool. What kind of art? Pine cones. Pine cones? Mm-hmm [affirmative]. Yeah, I collect them from the local forest and then I spray them with pesticides and paint them silver. And then I sell them on eBay or at a local market with an older lady called Janice. Right, okay, and what, and people buy that? I mean like, I don't know, I mean where do you put them? Like what on the mantle or? In a bowl, Christmas time's really good money. They hang them on the trees. Oh. Is there a wake? After the funeral, a celebration of death? What, the wake? I mean usually it's celebration of someone's life. Yeah, but in this case it's a celebration of death because it's good that he's dead, because I guess it could be both. Wow, okay, what'd he do to you? Well no, I don't know him, I just know he was an alcoholic. So? So he's like my neighbor's cat. It was old and it couldn't breath and they just kept it alive. So I put it to sleep. Snapped its neck. [crunching] [cat screaming] You, what does that have to, wait, what, you snapped its neck? Yeah, it was quick. That's not your decision to make. Well, it was the right one. Wow, okay. [laughing] You snapped its neck? [laughing] You snapped its neck? You snapped a cat's neck. Yes. [laughing] Stop that. [laughing] Stop. Hey, hey, hold on. Wait for the second click. So autism. That is, I mean, hey, so that's why you don't talk. Or you struggle to talk. I mean I don't know much about autism. What is it you can't do? And also, like when you get like a boyfriend, or such, are they like autistic too? What? So, are they like, are they like autistic too? Why do they have to be autistic? Well, because then, you know, you've both got autism. And then when we come together we glow as our autism intensifies? No, no, no. Come on, I mean like, so for example, you couldn't flirt with someone like me, because that's me taking advantage of you, because, you know, you're disabled. Are you fucking serious right now? What? First of all, autism is something that affects how easy it is to form a relationship with someone, so while I might be at a biological disadvantage, there's still 100% more likely to get laid than you. Second of all... Whoa, I didn't mean... Do I not have a brain? - Can I not say no? - Yeah, no, of course. I'm not incapable, if I wanna talk to a guy, then I will when I'm ready. - Yeah, of course. - If I want to be - spontaneous then I will. - I didn't say, I didn't mean. Of course, I didn't, what? That's fine, literally I'm just saying I'm unfamiliar with the condition. Clearly I've struck a nerve. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Undo your trousers, I'll toss you off. What the fuck? I want to, you're not taking advantage of me. What the hell is going on? I have something to prove. No, no, you don't, you have nothing to prove. You have nothing to prove. Jesus Christ. Careful, there's incoming traffic. It was stationary. Am I raping you? No, you just have nothing to prove. I wasn't even, I didn't. I actually want to do it. It's okay, I just, I wasn't ready.

The guy whose funeral it is? No. But he's family and family is family, I guess. Yeah I guess. I think I need my SATNAV. He killed himself, you know? Yeah, no, I heard. Why did he kill himself? Why are we talking about this? Sorry. Well, yeah, it's just so heavy, isn't it? Like, I mean how can I even answer that? I don't know, I just, maybe people feel like they fuck up one too many times, I don't know. Yeah but everybody fucks up, right? Yeah, I guess so. I mean, everybody does stupid shit. Like my friend, Carly, she let a guy give her a mushroom stamp. Oh yeah, what's that? A mushroom stamp? Yeah? It's when a guy grabs the stem of his penis and he dabs his balls into shit and then he gently presses it on the other person's forehead like a stamp, a mushroom stamp.

No, no, of course I don't want to fight, I don't want any trouble, please, I just. Wait, 50KG? [laughs] I mean add a one in front of that. Actually my PB was 140, although my form was terrible. So on paper... You fucking smart aleck, hey? No, I don't know why I said that. I'm so sorry. Hit him. Let's just move on with our day, okay?

My heart rate is through the roof. But in like an exciting way. Not like when you go swimming and sometimes you hold your breath underwater and it gets to a point where you're like just a few more seconds and I'm a goner. What? Do you like swimming? Nah, I never learnt. Where are we stopping tonight? Newcastle. Is it nice? Yeah, you never been? You know there will be some nice bars. We could grab a drink? I know I could certainly use one. I don't drink. What, not even orange juice? No, well, obviously I drink orange juice. Well then fine, then we'll pump you full of shoog, won't we? Really? Yeah. Like a legitimate bar, where there's bar fights? Ah, I bloody hope not. [upbeat club music] Awesome, there we go, are you good? Yeah. Oh, excuse me, can I have a whisky, please? Because, because why not? [laughing] And an orange juice, please. [Bartender] No worries. Cheers, man, thank you. This place is incredible. Alright darling, fancy a ride? I've never been anywhere like this before. It's just a Monday. It does smell funny. It sure does. Cheers man, thank you so much. Thank you. Cheers. Can I tell you something? You are genuinely one of the most interesting people I've ever met. Sorry, I'll try to stop talking so much. No, no, hey, it's a good thing, it's a great thing. It's awesome, you're so quirky without even trying. It's awesome. You're genuinely very funny. Is this because I killed the neighbor's cat? No, stay away from my pets, but stuff like that, stuff like that, like you do what most people wouldn't. Despite it probably being the kinda right thing to do. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. I killed that cat real good. Yeah, again, the cat thing is kind of - like a bad thing. - Would you lie to me? About what? Anything. I don't know, probably. No, I don't think you would. I mean, I have no reason to. If you're being annoying, I'll tell you. Okay, I just wish that sometimes people were as blunt with me as I am them. It's just that my parents, they, well they don't really think that I can handle life, so they don't let me do anything. But then how are you going to live and learn if they don't let you live and learn? Yes, did you just come up with that on your own? Yeah, I guess. Wow, can you tell my parents that? No, no, that's for you to do. Well I do, but then I get angry, and then they pass that off as rage, which is commonly associated with autism, but it's actually not that. It's just the way that I feel. I don't know, man, it sounds tough. I mean they let you come with me, though? That's, I mean, oh, that's huge, surely. Yeah, but that was for the wrong reasons. Well, because I was in an accident not that long ago, so it just made them worry about me even more than they already do. But they knew that I had to do this that I had to just get out and do it. Yeah, I don't know. Hey, how would you like the tiniest, tiniest bit of prosecco in your orange juice? The tiniest bit. No. No? No, it's just, what's that drink? - Mimosa. - It's just a, oh, it's a mimosa. It's just a mimosa. Come on, a little mimosa, wanna little mimosa? Little, just a little? Yes. Yes? Yes. Yes? Yes! Yes! Yes. One mimosa please, sir. And one more whisky please, sir. [Bartender] Coming right up. No, no, no, I'm driving tomorrow, so it's probably best I kinda call it quits. Sexy, baby! No. Yes, yes. No. Yeah, you've got them big teeth. You like them? Oh, yeah, they are like mine. Look at my front two teeth, they're big like plates. Wow, big. Yeah, thanks, I grew them myself. So how come you're Austrian? Ah, [puffing] ah, Australian? Dad. Dad? You know I can do the accent? No you can't, everyone thinksthat they can but you can't. No, I can, I can. Listen, are you ready? [coughing] Ah, see them girls over there? Ah, yeah, I'm gonna go kiss them. I'm gonna go kiss them. No. No? Yeah, that was... - Yeah? - That was pretty good. Yeah, I was good, see? Yeah. [laughing] One more round, officer. No, no, no, please no, please no. So how come you had boyfriends, but you're not allowed out of the house? I did it before that they thought that I would want to. So it was out of spite. Spite. Whoa, well. Would you date me? No. No, no. - Why? - No, no, no, no, no. Why not? No. Why not? Too much work, you're too much work. Give me a kiss. No, no. Kiss, kiss. No. Kiss. No. [kissing] Hmm. - Ugh. - Now me. That's gross. Me. [laughing] [laughing] No, we can't do this, we're family. What? We're family. No, what, I gave you the hand job. The good old fashion.

Again, you've gotta ask your parents, I mean that's not my decision, I can't say. But you would want me to? [blowing] I mean, I don't know, it's been a long journey, you know? And like all the way back and you going off on one in my ear like oh, you know, look at me, I've got autism. You know, I'm pretty sick of it, to be honest, you know. Pretty bloody sick of it. Obviously I'm joking. Obviously, I'd love that. Ah. Ah. [laughing] Sunny. [laughing] Can I tell you something? Yeah, of course. I feel very comfortable around you, more so than anyone else, even my parents. You're very easy to talk to. I'm glad. You know that accident I told you about in the bar? Ah, yeah? I nearly died. Oh, shit. I cut my wrist. My parents think it was an accident but I did it on purpose. But in reflection, it was an accident. Why would you do that? I don't know, I guess I wantedto know what would happen. What, are you fucking nuts? You want to know what would happen? Sunny, I'll tell you what would happen, you'd bleed out and you'd die, you die. Well, I know you die. I know you die. Jesus, no wonder your parents don't feel like they can leave you to do your own thing. You'll probably go into the kitchen and stick your head in the fucking microwave. Why are you making me feel stupid? I already feel guilty. I shouldn't have told you, you don't understand. And why are you getting so mad at me? What have I done wrong? Nothing, nothing. I'm sorry it's just thatpeople are so desperate to live and you're here and you're fine, you're healthy. And you're just willing to give that all up for nothing. Like there are people that are far worse off than you and in comparison you're fucking fine, you're healthy. Well, I didn't feel fine and I didn't feel healthy. And what about the people around you, like your family? The people that spend so much time to care for you because they love you? Like if you killed yourself, what about them, huh? Now, how would they feel? Don't you think that's fucking selfish? Well, I didn't have anything to look forward to. Well, then get a fucking hobby. Stop the car. Sunny, I'm not stopping the car. Stop the car. Sunny, we're on a main road. - Stop the fucking car. - Sunny, I'm not stopping the car, we're on a main road. - Stop the fucking car. - Sunny, I'm not. Stop the fucking car, stop the fucking car. Stop the fucking car, stop the fucking car. - Stop the fucking car. - Okay, okay, okay. [melancholic piano music] Shit, shit. Sunny! Sunny, please! Sunny! Oh, shit, Sunny! [water splashing] [sneezing] [spitting] Oh, he can't swim. [heavy breathing] [groaning] [heavy breathing] I don't care. I didn't say anything. Well, why aren't you saying anything? Because in all honesty, I don't know what to say. When we get home are you going to tell my parents? What, that you eventually stopped me from drowning? The thought hadn't crossed my mind. I was still thinking about how I was drowning. No, about how I still feel this way sometimes and I still think like this. Well, I don't know, I don't want you to have another accident again, so. Well, they won't let me out of the house if you do. Yeah, but you might die if I don't tell them. Well, what's the point in living if I don't have a bloody life anyway? Sunny, I don't know what you're going through, so I don't know what to say. But I know what I said earlier, it wasn't what I meant. And it wasn't right. You know I actually did want to come with you. Well not you personally, but when I found out that someone had to get a lift from my family, I jumped at the chance. My family make me feel like an alien. I hate it. I actually begged and cried to be the one to get the lift with you and the only reason why they said yes was because that I said that I would text them every 30 minutes. I was so terrified, standing out the front of my house, but not as scared as I was doing nothing by myself day in and day out. This has been the most thrilling experience of my life. Of my life, Ryan. A fucking extended road trip. I live my life so planned and organized and that has all gone to shit and my heart has been racing majority of the time and it has been for the best and the worst ways but I finally feel like I'm living, and that's because I feel safe with you. But the best part is that I finally felt like I'd met someone that understood me, that gets me. And now I just feel like an alien again. - Sunny... - And that's why I have one friend, Carly. And she's been mushroom stamped. And it stained her head. [laughing] I won't tell your parents. I guess you've got to make your own decisions in life, right? But please if you ever, ever feel like that again, please feel like you can talk to me. No, you'll yell. No, I won't, I'll listen. You know I'm really glad you've popped up in my life. I just don't want to lose you. You know, you're really easy to talk to. [slow acoustic music] Well, I guess we're finally here. Yeah, I can see my mom. I guess we should head in. Yeah. I'll let you go be with your family. Why, where are you going? Oh, I'm gonna hold back, I'm not really interested in the ceremony. I can pay my respects from around here. Oh. Can I stay with you? Yeah. Funerals are dumb. There's not many people here for him. That doesn't surprise me. Sunny! Oh, my God, Sunny, where the hell have you been? You were suppose to meet us yesterday. Sorry. What have you done to your head? Are you okay? Yes, mom, I'm fine. Okay, okay. Hi, Ryan. Thank you so much for driving. It's fine, honestly. Oh, what have you done to your face? Did you? No, it happened before the journey. Oh, my heart. [laughing] Here's me kicking up a fuss in front of you and you probably even remember who I am. [laughing] I don't, I'm sorry. That's fine, I wouldn't expect you to. It's very kind of you to come at all considering. You know he wasn't terrible, he really wasn't. He had lots of issues and well he certainly had his demons. But he wasn't one himself. Sunny, darling, John's going to come back with Helen now. So you can squeeze in with us for our journey back. Ah. Alright well, I shall see you in the car. Five minutes. Just be over there. Okay, Bye, Ryan. It was lovely to see you. And you. I don't understand. Huh? You don't know him. No, I don't. So why is my mom talking to you like you care more than what you do? I don't know, because he's my biological father. Yeah I know that, but, of course he is, but I'm sorry, why are you here? He left when I was really, really young. And I never had... Yeah, sorry, but why are you here and not at home with your mum? I don't... It's just that you made it seem like you didn't care so I just I don't understand. I don't care, he wasn't a father to me then and I don't see him as a father now. - No, I understand that. - You know, Sunny, it's not something I really want to talk about. Are you keeping something from me? Are you protecting me from something? Because I don't need protecting. Okay, I know you. Sunny, you've only just met me. Don't patronize me, okay? Don't make me feel like this whole journey is any less than what it is, 'cause I know what it is and I know what I feel. You know what, Sunny? Sunny, it's not always about you. Okay, I know you're used to all the attention but it's not always about you. Are you lying to me? I mean, do you actually care about your dad or is everything you said about your mom true as well? Is she really dying? Sunny. Because if she is and she is at home right now and you are the only person that she has, I mean what the fuck are you doing at this man's funeral? I don't know, God, I don't know Sunny. Please, please stop, I don't know. I just wanted to get away. Yeah, but your mom. There has to be a better reason. I mean, she must really need you and want you right now. Don't you think I know that? Jesus. [sighing] You know I wake up and I look at her and I see her and I am forced to be reminded that I'm gonna lose her. And God, I love her, I love her so much. You know this one time, I won this shitty little award at work and she was there, she came for it and I walked up and when I went to collect it, I saw her, she went to stand up and she couldn't, she just feel straight back down. You know I wake up every morning and I slap a smile on my face and I care for her, the best that I possibly can. And I stay positive, because I know that if I don't, [crying] that it'll end her. I kinda feel so selfish 'cause I know it's not my illness, but I'm so tired. God, I'm so tired. Get her. No, no, dad, no! Get your fucking hands off her! With me now.
