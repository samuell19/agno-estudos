Enlightenment You have the power to make your dreams come true What do you mean? Will I get whatever I ask? Whatever is embedded in your heart will be fulfilled 'Heard that, Pambu?' My astrologer-neighbor's prediction has come true Not only will you cross your legs in comfort You can even dance on anyone's head Ask something useful In a whirlpool of happiness I don't even know what to ask - My mind is stuck - What to ask? Ask her for 100 kg of gold Bravo! Pambu Gold 'Thangam' 100 kg gold Oh my God! Is she my wish come true? Hey! What is this?

Why are you bungling our boon? Why did you ask for a 'veena' now? Even I don't understand Think deeply This 'veena' has made a deep impact in your heart Think of the reason I remember now, Pambu When we were 10 years old How keen your younger sister was to learn playing the 'veena' But the people around us said 'How can the hand that washes vessels want a 'veena' to play music?' How much they hurt your innocent sister's heart? Every day when she sobbed her heart out I felt weighed down and depressed I used to think I should earn well And buy her a 'veena' It was on my wish list, dude I don't know why But somehow as I grew up it slipped my mind After so many years Now my brain is refreshed Why are you making me cry? Get lost, you idiot! You are a gem of a friend I know I messed it up this time too Ask them not to burn me all over I'll try once more No need, you passed your test In fact we came to your world only to learn this powerful sentiment from you This emotion is the biggest power of your entire human race We are trying to learn love and compassion from you But you seem to have forgotten these emotions Only love and righteousness will protect your world You are not beasts Don't forget you are human beings I have to talk to a very important person I want to do so when it is in my mind Can I make a call?

I've given you a far more precious gift than the booze you came in search of Use it intelligently 'Coriander o'va' 'Coriander o'va' Coriander o'wa' 'Coriander o'va' Coriander o'wa' - What did she mean? - Listen!

Our dhobi is lying there as a headless corpse, sir 'Quit India, No more British Rule' 'Foreigner Quit India' 'British paramountcy Down down!' 'British rule Down down!!' 'Won't you let anyone be safe and sound in our village?' What happened? Who is this? This is our washerman, sir This is the 6th murder All corpses are found headless Something is fishy Not just murders, annachi 8 babies have gone missing so far This situation is going beyond our control We have to get the police to investigate, annachi Arunachalam, this is strange coming from you Have we allowed any policeman into our village at any point of time? The entire village is panic-stricken I feel only the police can handle this efficiently Arunachalam You are too young to make any decision, mind your tongue If your elder brother was here, well aware of my status he would have kept quiet Pipsqueak! Our family has been protecting this village through generations Don't share your opinions with me I'll bite your Adam's apple Sir, listen to our gardener's tale - What is it? - Sir My wife and I were sleeping peacefully after a hard day's work in the grove, sir Suddenly in the middle of the night 'We heard a voice, sir' Sir...sir, the moment we saw that gory, blood stained face My heart almost stopped beating If you employ both of us in your house in any job We can be live-in hired helpers I'll smash your face I asked you to take care of the grove Will you get sozzled and tell me ghost stories? Annachi, I saw that gory sight too We are petrified we will be next Give us a job in your house, sir Bloody useless donkey! Defending your husband? 'Good for nothing oaf!' I'll tie you both and skin you alive Sir, what he's saying is true When I went to milk the cows at dawn a girl with a gory face walked past me Even I was spooked seeing her, sir This issue is taking a new twist All of you listen to me No one should step out after sunset Understand? Ask the youngsters to take turns guarding the village Protecting this village is my sole responsibility Understand? Don't be scared, go home Bloody morons! 'Look at the spread for all of us celebrating her husband's return' 'Forget the feast, look at her cheeks' 'She is in the pink of health!' Hey! Umayaal Sitting like a princess Get up, go and serve everyone Thieving rascal! Showing your cheap mentality even if we are generous If you don't put back what you stole- 'Pandi, stop it' How can you hit our guest? What right do you have? Does our guest have the right to steal our possessions, madam? - Go, attend to your work - Yes, madam Forgive me, madam You help the whole village How could I steal from your house! I'm a wretched fellow - Please forgive me - What happened? My wife is bedridden, madam My children go without food for days I pledged my fertile land to my landlord I have no job I am plagued by hunger and worry day and night That drove me to this ungrateful act - I am sorry - No one should be in your shoes Keep this, feed your family first Send your children to school You should be the deity in our temple, madam We are blessed You got married into a family in our village You will enjoy peace and prosperity being so golden hearted, madam Pandi, pack food for his family also I will do so at once, madam You will come and eat unashamedly whoever invites you, eh? Welcome, annachi What a surprise seeing you here I would love to visit you often But I am unable to, you see Not bad, our army officer has built a decent house And given you a lovely daughter too Come in, annachi You are visiting us for the first time I'll personally make coffee with sugar for you Sweet coffee Enjoy your meal, all of you I'll drink my sweet coffee 'Come, child' Taste my black coffee with palm sugar, sir It seems you predict for the entire village It is an oracle from our village deity Whatever you predict comes true it seems Is it so? Sit down and predict my future Nothing of that sort, sir Whatever image floats before me when I close my eyes and think calmly I write it down Few of those notes come true I don't even understand some of my forecasts I have written down many of my thoughts that is a mystery even to me Read through them These are beyond my comprehension Imagine if events that will happen 100 years later are recorded here But I don't know if all my predictions will come true or not, annachi Not bad Tell me once you finish writing it I know many publishers We will print this as a book - Thank you, sir - All that is fine Just write down whatever strikes you this very moment Let us see if it comes true 'Umayaal, bring me a sheet of paper and pen' - Drink your coffee - Take that Amma, take You go 'This village will turn into a place of peril' 'For sins to flourish' 'Your land will turn into a graveyard' I wrote what came to my mind Don't take it amiss, sir You haven't written anything new, dear Our village is in a state of chaos Let's ignore that Think of something for me and write Show me your hand, sir 'Why is she checking my pulse?' 'Will she blurt out the dark thoughts in my mind openly?' 'She is super-hot! So am I!!' 'Will she guess?' 'What is she writing?' Don't break the pots, sir Which pot did you- Aiyo! I meant this pot, annachi If I hadn't said you will break this pot- Maybe you wouldn't have broken it May be so I have such doubts nagging me too Do things happen because I write? Or is it an oracle flowing out of my mind unknowingly? It is a million rupee question swirling in my brain Amma, appa is here Is it so? Come...come Pot Oh gawd! What...what is it? Where is he? Forgive me, 'anni' They have bundled up my brother and sent him Why should it happen only to us? Sister-in-law, don't Don't go, anni Karthika'ma You can no longer adorn yourself with flowers and 'kumkum' You gave the entire village a feast to receive your husband from the warfront What a tragedy! This house, fields, surrounding forest Your husband has bequeathed all his assets to you in his will The military man has willed all his possessions to you 'How will you manage all this by yourself?' Give it to me for safe custody I'll ensure you lead a comfortable life 'What do you say, lawyer sir?' You focus on bringing up your daughter with a lot of love I know to raise my child, sir Take care and go back home before sunset I heard many end up as headless corpses in our village Umayaal, come in We haven't as yet finished our funeral rites for my brother You came flocking here so soon like vultures to grab our wealth Are you human at all? Get up Look at that young fellow deriding us Arunachalam, wait Hey Pandi Attend to your work What is happening here? Is your sister-in-law behaving like a widow? She is decked up with flowers, 'kumkum' and finery - Won't you reprimand her? - She is still in denial I'm happy if she and her child have peace of mind Instead of poking your nose in others' business Investigate the missing children and multiple murders in our village What...arrogance! - Hey Pandi - Sir Pandi, come here Vanakkam, aiya What is happening in this house? She is decked in all her finery He is blabbering like a full-fledged fool Sir, even I don't know what is going on Queer things are happening in this house, sir 'Queer' means? I mean Tell me or I'll hit you In the beginning her oracle was astounding and amazing But nowadays it is scary and spooky, sir What is happening which terrifies you so much? We have a dog called Muthu at home It suddenly went missing We looked for it all over the place Couldn't find it at all 'But do you know what happened that night?' Muthu MUTHU Muthu...? Muthu? Muthu Muthu Muthu Muthu Is all this true? I swear on my wife, sir It didn't stop with just the dog squealing, sir I've even heard babies and children scream in pain Then all those children that went missing in our village Is she the culprit? It seems too barbaric to even think about it 'This is madness, brother' 'Ask all the fools to go home' 'My head is splitting' 'Don't step into my space' Annachi I've never seen my 'anni' lose her temper like this I don't subscribe to any of your views Kindly leave He who lifts the cross knows the burden So many children missing Headless corpses strewn everywhere I am answerable to the bereaved families Somehow my suspicion is on your sister-in-law Our priest will clarify the situation You keep quiet If she is not the culprit why should your 'anni' be scared? Here he is Bring him over Come, 'nambudri' priest Vanakkam Where is the woman? My sister-in-law is inside Let us go in Why isn't there a single picture of God inside the house? I think my sister-in-law lost faith in God ever since my brother passed away Yes, sir, I'm working here for many years I've never seen a single photo of God I've never seen her go to the temple - Who are you? - Servant Pandian You can talk only when I ask you to speak - Understand? - Yes, sir Go and bring that woman - Go - Alright, sir 'Let go of me' 'You are hurting me' 'I can't bear this pain' 'Let go of me' 'God help me' Sir...aiya, spare me Don't ask me to go in She is in a gory state inside Arunachalam sir I'll take my wife and children and leave this village - Sir...save me - Hey! Pandi Hey! Shut up 'Hey! Let go of me' 'Can't you hear me? Let go, stop it!' 'Hey! Who are you? Playing your tricks on me!' 'Stop...stop it' 'holy chant to exorcise evil spirit' 'Praise be to Goddess Bairavi Protector of negative energy' You must tell only the truth to all the questions I will ask now When this girl was born ...did her parents die after her birth? I don't know Hey! Yes, he is right It was a postnatal death for the mother When the father was informed and he rushed home He died in a train accident When this girl attained puberty was there any disaster in the village? What is this, annachi? He's asking such foolish questions Be quiet, he's right in asking this Kasi annachi, don't you remember? On that specific day Our school building collapsed and many children died Yes, priest I didn't even eat I rushed to the spot And to my utmost horror I found the news to be true Is her husband alive? Back to square one! He got married to her and a daughter was born to them He joined the military force Came back lifeless bundled up 'Fate dealt him a death blow' 'Nambudri priest' What is the redemption? She was born with a bad soul Her power will only become worse Unless we curb her obstinacy The case of the missing children Or these murders can be interrogated When she predicted saying she is the Oracle I knew something was amiss Our foolish villagers were praising her sky-high What is the solution, nambudri? Snip her tongue so her words won't come true Offer her to the village to purify the bad soul Only if she 'serves' everyone in this village ...can her sins be redeemed Here's the sacred ash Apply on her forehead 'Barber, come here' All of you move aside Her tongue will be snipped off Close your eyes, dear "Time changes as seasons go by" 'humming a song' 'Kasi' 'Hey Kasi' 'Turn back and look at me, Kasi' Ammaaa...! Nam...nam...nambudri You, huh? Thank god you came in the nick of time Something is calling me by my name How? Kasi...Kasi Did it say, 'Turn back and look at me, Kasi'? Are you the murderer? Yes, da Hey...hey! What happened, annachi? Why are you so terrified? That priest was...in front of your house- - I'll handle him - Wait- Not now We'll deal with him later Sit, take a deep breath Tell me clearly so I can understand You are a godsend Your servant and that priest are the murderers we are hunting for They are coming to kill me now What happened? They are chasing me Dim-witted duffers! Come here Brainless idiots If I had trusted you and sat inside what will be my plight? Driving your sister-in-law out of your house worked as per your plan We've offered her as a vow Why this killing spree? I'll pickle you to pieces That female is having a hard time 'serving' random men How can I enjoy my wealth while she suffers? Won't the villagers deride me? What do you want us to do now? All those who slept with that female are missing Our village head had his fun with her, he is dead too We don't have to do anything anymore The people will take care of her Cast this corpse in the center of our village Ask the people to assemble near the well I'll bring that female over there We'll close her chapter today and divide the wealth - Got it? - Yes GO 'Why didn't you kill yourself when you were 'offered' as public property' 'This kid sleeping here' 'She will share your fate one day' What are we doing here, ma? 'Forgive me, dear' 'I am a wretched woman' - 'Stop' - Amma Give me the child Did you see that? She tried to push this child into the well Sorceress! Wonder how many more children are lying at the bottom? Wretched sorceress! Where are our children? We must not spare her - Dissect her to pieces - Dai Pandi Priest What do we do to her? We have no option Offering her life to God is the only solution Don't do! You will rot in hell You won't prosper in life! STOP IT! Whatever you want to do don't prolong the torture Why are you behaving in this barbaric fashion? Amma Umayaal Our priest has to pelt the first stone at her Start Amma Amma 'Stone her to death' Lord Shiva! Aiyo! You will rot in hell What grave injustice you are doing to this good hearted soul! Hey! 'This sorceress isn't dead as yet' She has to be hanged to death Lend me a hand "Sun has set, sleep with ease" "As the owl hoots, rest in peace" "Close your eyes, don't prolong the pain" "Mind won't be restless ever again" "Sleep eternally, for ties are fake" "Forsake this world for your own sake" Brain box you are, I say You made your niece kill her own mother How will you dispose off that small donkey? When I could plan this cleverly don't I know how to handle that kid? Let her grow a bit Accuse her of something and make her a hustler Brother is always right - You drink, bro - Pour some more Brother, you promised me half that forest land Will you look into it? - Did you leave the stove on? - No, brother I can smell something burning? You are right Something is burnt I can smell it too This is not the smell of food burning Corpse Smell of a corpse This is not possible Karthika has come! No...no, please Please...please Please no No Priya - 'Hello?' - Priya All the characters I read in that book are coming alive and scaring me What are you blabbering, Umayaal? 'Don't get flustered' 'I want to tell you something important' 'Come home right now' I'm coming 'I'm totally confused' I don't understand what's going on, Priya I'm sitting here in a worse confused state than you, Umayaal What happened? I read the missing pages my brother gave from the archives Oh my god! My head is spinning Take a look yourself 'Author: Umayaal Karthika' Isn't your full name Umayaal Karthika? But how is this possible? Even I don't get it One of the characters in that book is called Karthika Her daughter's name is Umayaal That Karthika character possessed super powers Oh my God! 1 minute 'Every single word of Karthika's became an oracle from God' 'The stories and essays she wrote turned into reality' 'God's Grace of looking into the future' 'She possessed that power' - Do you know what this means? - I have no clue This book has been written by the character Karthika But the most cruel fact She has written her own end knowing very well what will happen It's damn sad All that is okay But how do you share her name Umayaal Karthika? Maybe sheer coincidence Okay, all this is coincidence Let's assume all the characters you saw are a figment of your imagination But how can your handwriting be ditto what's in the book? That means? Same name Same signature Can't you see? You were Karthika in your previous birth Are you serious? There's only one way to find out of this is serious or not You write in this book like Karthika did Let's see if it comes true - What do I write? - Whatever strikes you 'I am starving' Give it to me I am starving A hot meal would be most welcome Whaaat? Hey! Did you hear that? Cooker whistle as soon as I said I needed food Because I kept rice for dinner when I got back home Write something else Santa Claus will chase me to kill me with a bell and an axe in each hand How bizarre! What a stupid note Who is it? Who is it? Take that knife Dai nutcase! You, huh? I'm your brother and you're deriding me! Why did you bang on the door like this? Priya is wanted at home It's late, so I knocked Are you coming or not? Okay, bye We'll continue the rest of our investigation tomorrow Okay, come Enough hugging There's food in the kitchen Don't forget subtitled by rekhs 'Karungkaapiyam Dark Tales' calibrated at AP International
