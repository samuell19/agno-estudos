I find rocks near a movie studio We used to go there ourselves We often went walking We sure did We found this "Water Containing Rock" there Someone wanted it for 100,000 yen 100,000 yen?! Rock-appreciating started in the 14th century It originated in China In the 18th century an appreciation method was established: A rock on a sand-filled tray "Suiseki," or rock and water "Bonkei" or miniscape, consists of several rocks "Bonkei" can use several rocks, but "Suiseki" must express a landscape with only one rock "Bonkei" is human performance "Suiseki" requires natural beauty I'll take this Thank you very much 200 yen Mrs. Sukegawa Chinese cabbage is cheap I'll take pickled cabbage My shop needs a part-time cashier. Why not do it? The more I work, the lazier my man gets He's selling rocks this time? While trying out many things, he'll make it Lottery's better I had a Kaji as my senior A real expert Karuishi's no match for him He was a konjak dealer One day he asked me: "How many eyes do you use to see rocks?" I answered, "Two." Then he said: "That's not enough. You need four eyes to see rocks "And rocks are like konjak" I said, "Rocks are hard; konjak, soft." He replied, "You're still a novice. "Rocks are just like konjak; they are "warm and very soft." Lately I've begun to understand what he meant Let me show you something A "Figure Rock," but this type is... extremely commonplace It lacks elegance But the way it gets wet... It's the best one I've ever seen How many times have I had to hear that lecture! He has only expensive rocks. Worth a fortune No, no. They aren't his rocks We dealers consign them to him for sales We use his influence to sell them to... rich people And he takes a big margin And seldom pays us dealers Business with him is risky But he has lots of experience Why not drink? Not me Let's drink to our friendship I'm in a hurry Where are you going? Is it money? I have some Your case is difficult You look so tender your guts don't show Show your guts more openly You sure? Don't talk like that Listen Watch out for Sekiun's wife She was ogling you with hungry eyes She's a slut He booted out five of our fellow dealers after they had flirtations with her Sake made him ill, and he became impotent She had a reason then She was the wife of a public bathhouse owner It's gone now, because a bad dealer grabbed it It was deep in the mountains, there were few clients Then Sekiun arrived to stay for a few days And he ran off with the bathhouse owner's wife Her husband was... me! While going to Sekiun's place many times trying to get back Tatsuko he taught me about rocks I'd lived by catching fish and snakes and making bird houses Mine was such a poor life!
