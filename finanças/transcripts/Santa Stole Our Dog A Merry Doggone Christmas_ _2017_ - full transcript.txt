Ho ho! Ho ho ho! Huh! What's that, Dad? Check it out. It's a frozen cookie. So what? This is not any ordinary oatmeal cookie, Tommy. Santa Claus bit into this cookie. Santa Claus? Yeah. Good old Saint Nick. There's no such thing as Santa Claus. Of course there's a Santa Claus. When did you stop believing in Santa? Since I grew up. You're only 13. I'm going to be 14 in four and a half months. Besides, I'm going to be a detective someday, and I live by facts and facts alone. What does that have to do with not believing in Santa Claus? We get presents every year as proof. That's not proof. Well, you got that cookie. And this cookie is almost 30 years old. I wouldn't eat it if I were you. That's right. Now all we have to do is figure out who took a bite out of that cookie. How do you do that? I'm a detective, Suzie. I'll just send it to the lab. What lab, silly? Dad, don't they do DNA tests nowadays? I think they do. People find out their exact family heritage. Can't Mom do it? Doesn't she do that with her patients? Probably. So we'll send it to her, and she'll prove that Santa Claus doesn't exist. That is an excellent idea. That's an excellent idea.

Come on. Quit dawdling. Quick. I gotta get to the hospital. Suzie, have you got everything? Mmm. Mom. What, honey? Why are you and Daddy not living together? Oh, because we're not getting along right now. Don't you like Daddy anymore? I love your father, but we are very different people. How are you different? Your father needs to grow up. You mean he's gonna get bigger? No, sweetie. He often plays the big kid, and he needs to grow up and deal with the world around him. My teacher said a person can be childlike without being childish. What does that mean? It means that an adult can still have the wonder and appreciation of a child without acting like a child. Isn't that what Daddy is? Hey, can Rusty come visit us? The dog stays at your father's house. Mmm. Honey, I didn't grow up with any animals. They are a big responsibility. They shed, and they're dirty, and they poop everywhere. Poop? I never understood why anyone would want that responsibility. But isn't it worth the responsibility? They can be our best friend. They can make us happy when we're sad. Can't we trust them more than people? Yes. You are right about that. Good night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams, baby girl. Sleep tight. The bird is cute, I guess, but it's just a stuffed doll. There are thousands, hundreds of thousands of stuffed animals out there. There's nothing to make this bird of yours really stand out. Yes, Mr. Dougal, but he-- I'm sorry. Uh, Mr. Bosloy. But he's unique. He's a dodo bird. A dodo bird. They're-- they're extinct. I'm assuming this is... an original design. Yes. Yes! And I-- and I think that he could be the next big seller. They're extinct, except for Mister Dodo. Except for Mister Dodo. Yay! I don't see anything special about him. He's cute, but it's not something our toy company would be interested in distributing at this time. The kids, they love him. Call me if you develop anything new. Happy holidays, Mr. Woodshaven. Haven. White-- Whitehaven. Woodhall. Sorry. I don't usually use briefcases. Okay. Mmm. Come on, kids. Dad's waiting. See you later, Mom. Race you, Tommy! Out of my way! Oh. Did you take your homework with you? It's Christmas vacation, Mom. We don't have any homework. You sure? Yes. Jan, give 'em a break. It's almost Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'll pick the kids up Christmas Day. But I was planning on taking them to the outdoor skating rink. They have a real skating rink in California. Can you believe that? I gave you Christmas Eve. Daddy said he got me some skates. I wanna go skating. There's no such thing as an outdoor skating rink in Santa Barbara. Yes, there is, Mom. Dad said it's like a hard plastic or something. It's just like ice, but it doesn't melt. Okay. All right. Come here, you. Rah! Scoot over, Rusty. Let's get out of here before Mom changes her mind. ♪ It's a California Christmas Don't you know?♪ Never feels like Christmas in California. Why is that, Daddy? Where I grew up, we always had a white Christmas. But it's too cold in Canada. Yeah, but you've never built a snowman before. I want a white Christmas next year.

Let's take a look. "Certificate of Adoption." It looks like Suzie adopted a polar bear. How cool is that? You know that polar bears are actually endangered species? Because the polar ice caps are melting all the time. That is really cool, Suzie. I didn't even know you could adopt a polar bear. Oh, almost forgot! Tommy, open this. You know who this is for?

There's going to be a child or children somewhere in the world who's going to be awfully upset with me. How could I steal their family dog? What kind of monster have I become? Santa, it wasn't your fault. We know that you didn't take the dog on purpose. Yes, but does the family know Santa didn't mean to steal their dog?

Yes. Hello out there. It's Windy, the weather girl, reporting to you live from the North Pole. According to NOAA, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration-- Now, folks, can you say that three times fast? The weather at the North Pole today is a warm zero degrees with a forecast of snow, snow, and snow. We've got some more Santa sightings that NORAD sent us from Santa's busy night on Christmas Eve. It looks like Santa wasn't alone last night. Looks like he had a furry little helper by his side. That's Rusty. Suzie, quick. Look. Wow, folks, could that be Santa's dog helping him out? Santa stole Rusty! No, someone that looks like Santa. Santa stole our dog! - Santa's not real! - Yes, he is! ...weather systems right now. Thanks, Windy. And more news on the recent Santa sighting. It appears that Santa... Now, you two, what's going on? It's Rusty. He's on the news. Rusty's on the TV. What are you two talking about? ...NORAD above the California coast. Santa stole Rusty! Oh, honey, that's not Rusty. Why would Rusty be with Santa? Looks like someone dressed as Santa stole him or something. That-- that is not Rusty. Look! It's right there! It is him. I know it's him. ...investigative research and learned that this dog is actually a rare Kai Ken. This breed is known for its brindle coloring, sharp ears, curious eyes, and loyalty and devotion to its master. Okay, that's a wrap. Huh. Thanks, Flame. Oh, nice job, Snowflake. I mean, Windy the weather girl. Thanks, Santa. Now, hopefully, someone will recognize this little guy and write me a letter letting me know. Let's just wait and see. Uh, can I help you? We received a 911 call that Santa Claus stole the family dog. Who? Well, I didn't call anyone. Dispatch received a call from someone named... Suzie. I am so sorry, officers. Has anyone seen your broadcast? Do we know whose dog I supposedly stole? No, but I think I've narrowed it down to the little doggie's origin. Yes? My research has determined that he's a rare Kai Ken from Japan. Of course. The sacred Kai Ken, also known as the Tiger Dog... also referred to as the Tora dog. He's Jewish? You... Tora, as in T.O.R.A., used as a Japanese code word for surprise, as in, "Tora! Tora! Tora!" By my research here, I've determined that they are very, very rare and most only found in Japan. Uh... Japan still has a lot of chimneys. Well, that narrows it down. Mmm, but thank you, Snowflake. You're welcome, Santa. "Dear Santa, you stole my dog. Please return him as soon as possible. Thank you. P.S. I'm still a good girl." So you will take my sleigh and look down every chimney in Japan. Every chimney? All of Japan? Every chimney, all of Japan. I get to steer the sleigh! No, I get to steer! You shall look into every chimney to see if there's a sad boy or girl missing their puppy. And you will report back to me every hour. Sounds like a great idea. No, it doesn't. When you find the right home, if you find the right home, you will slide him down the chimney into the arms of his family once again. Yes, Santa.Yes, Santa. Wait! Mr. Letter Man! Mr. Letter Man. Mr. Letter Man, can you deliver this letter for me? Aren't you a little late for Christmas? I know Christmas is over, but Santa has to get my letter. Well, you know, the Post Office usually doesn't forward letters to Santa Claus until next December. I can't wait another year. Santa stole our dog. - Excuse me? - It's a long story. Hmm. Suzie, get back in the house right now! I'll see what I can do. Can I borrow your pen? This one? Sure. Yay! Hey! That's my pen! I got his pen. This is Justin Graham with KBMS. I'm here with Suzie Whitehaven. You have a pretty interesting story for us, don't you? Santa stole my dog. Santa-- What was your dog's name? Rusty. Santa, can you please return Rusty? Where did you last see Rusty? When it was Christmas Eve, Santa came, and he accidentally stole Rusty. Oh, no. Santa, all this little girl wants for her Christmas is her dog back.

I came to visit you, Grandma. Oh, Tommy, that's so sweet. If Santa's real, then how can he visit every single home in the world in one night? Explain to me that, smarty-pants. Mmm! He can stop time. He stops the clocks... Mm-hmm. And then he goes to visit all the good little girls and boys. And when he's all done, he starts the clocks up again. It's not brain surgery, dork. You need to get to the North Pole and get your little doggie back. Yeah, Santa stole him. Santa didn't steal our dog. Santa's not real. Of course he's real. Then why would he steal Rusty? Because it was an accident. Or he just wanted a special dog like Rusty. Oh, I don't think he stole him, sweetie. Santa doesn't take. He gives. I agree with Grandma. I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose. If it was an accident, then why hasn't he returned him yet? Well, Santa visits over a billion homes. I'm sure he doesn't know which one Rusty belongs to. Okay, everybody, that's it. Time to go to bed. You have got a long trip ahead of you tomorrow. Thanks again for letting us borrow your car, Mom. Oh, sure. I don't drive it anymore anyway.

A magic magnet that guides me back to the magnetic North Pole. Without it, finding Santa's workshop is virtually impossible. I guess you could say that it gives me my magnetic personality. I was hoping maybe if you gave me a ride, that we could figure a way across the ocean and ice. So you wanted us to drive you there when you still didn't have your magnet? You're contradicting yourself! We can't believe anything you're saying. Hello. Who is it? We believe these were your possessions that were in the vehicle. This is great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh, hey, look. Our passports. What's this? This isn't ours. It was in with your stuff. Hey, isn't that Elroy's magnet? No way it could be. It couldn't be. It looks like a cheap kid's toy. Hah! Look. Mister Dodo. There's a switch on it. Whoa! Get these off! Thanks again for the magnet. Told you someone stole it. The police found it with our stuff. It looks like it's time to get back to California, guys. Yep. Wait! Aren't you going to the North Pole? Yeah, Daddy, what about Rusty? Honey, Rusty's not in the North Pole. Yes, he is. Santa took him by mistake. No, Suzie, he's not. Somebody who was dressed as Santa, just like the man who stole our luggage and Mister Dodo, stole Rusty. I'm sure that Rusty's back in our hometown somewhere. No! We have to save Rusty! - Come on, Suzie. - Wait. Open it. - This is a present for me? - Yeah. Oh, God. It's empty. Let's go. Thanks. You didn't open it right. Now open it. Okay. How did you do that? What's this? They're virtual-reality glasses, Dad. You're such a geek. Don't call Daddy a geek. Yeah, you're a geek. So immature. Uh, I don't see anything. Well, they're not actually virtual-reality glasses. They're reality glasses without the virtual. What are you talking about? Yeah, what are you talking about? Whoa, whoa, wait. I see a light now. Everyone be quiet. He needs to see something. What's going on, Dad? What are you doing? Are you okay, Daddy? Hello, son. Santa? How are you, Nathan? It's not Christmas. What are you doing here? Well, you're having a dilemma as an adult. As an adult? Mm-hmm. I had to come back and see you. See, Nathan, I can play with time... space. You can time travel? How do you think I deliver toys all over the world in one night? Just one night! Magic? Well, magic with a little time travel stirred in. I can also go back in time, too. Whttt! You've come back in time to see me? Yep. Your adult self needs me to have a talk with his inner child. Inner child? Well, every adult has been a child. They never lose that. Many cover it up, many forget, but the inner child is still in everyone. So what can I do? Well, when you grow up, you stop believing in me. I would never stop believing in you. Yeah, well, as an adult, you're doubting me as we speak. What do you think of that? You're starting to question whether I really exist. But-- but why would I ever stop believing in you? Because when you grow up, you're dealing with life, and life throws things at you. Phew! Curveballs. Sometimes life is not a bowl of cherries as we'd hoped. Sometimes people stop believing, stop believing in the magic. But I don't want to stop believing. That's why I'm here, Nathan, to make sure you never stop believing. As long as you believe in your heart and you believe in me and the magic of Christmas, the magic will stay with you, and it'll be Christmas all year round. Now here's a little something. What's this? To remind you to keep believing. Ah, ha. Santa? Santa? Are you feeling okay? What are you seeing in there? You okay? What's that? You okay, Dad? Hello. Yeah, sure. Okay. We'll be there in a minute. We have to go. Um... the police found a, uh-- a suspect they want us to identify. But don't you want to go to the North Pole? I can, now that I have my magic magnet. No. Thank you. It was, uh-- It was nice to meet you, Leroy. It's Elroy. Come on, Suzie. No, Daddy. No! Wait. Are you sure you don't want to go to the North Pole? Bye, Elroy. You still do not believe I'm an elf, do you? Are you sure you don't want me to take you to the North Pole? We need to make arrangements to get back to California. We're just gonna have to wait for Santa to visit next winter. Thank you, but we're-- Where did he go? Looking for me? Over here. Do you believe me now? See? He is an elf. Cool. Face left. Face right. Face the wall. That's him right there, right? - Number three? - Number three. Third one to the right. Should have known it was Kyle. He's the town kleptomaniac. What's a kleptomaniac? I didn't do it! It's someone who has an incredible urge to steal things. I'm innocent! Exit to your right. Okay, we'll stop somewhere, honey. Hey! Thank you for not pressing charges. Look. A reindeer. I'm Kyle. The officer told us how you saved that family when their Christmas tree caught fire. It was nothing. Hey, I hear you're going to the North Pole to see the real Santa? Can I come with? Merry Christmas, Kyle. Mmm. Kids, we gotta get going. Look out! Hey! - Dad! - Suzie! - Look out for the car! - Suzie! Suzie! Are you all right? You scared me. Yeah. Suzie! Thanks, Kyle. Suzie, you almost got hit. You could have gotten seriously hurt. I'm sorry. I'm glad you're okay. What did Daddy tell you about crossing the road? Don't do that again. You should have waited for Dad. - You almost got hit. - Sorry, Daddy. Thank you. You're welcome. I did a bad thing. Yes, you did. Well, I guess I'll go now. Can Kyle come with us? Please, Daddy? Please? Okay. Kyle... you can come. - Wow! - But you can't sit in the front. I'll sit in the back with the kids. Hoo hoo! No! This isn't the first time I've ridden in a trunk. Can I at least have a magazine? Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Unlike the fridge, the light does stay on. That's good.Wait, wait, wait, wait! Where'd you get this watch? You like it? Yeah. It's my watch! Give it back. Hurry up! Sorry. Come on. Thank you. Stay out of my luggage. Now if you follow my exact instructions, we'll be at the North Pole before you know it. What did he say? Thanks for fixing the window. Ow! Ow! Shh. Quiet! We're coming up on the Border Patrol. I can handle them. You know, once I went to the Border Patrol in Canada, and I-- Hey! That's not funny! It's dark in here! Stay quiet. Quiet. Hey, guys. Hi. Where are you headed? Uh... Arctic Circle and North Pole, sir. I didn't know the North Pole was another country. We own North Pole. Ah, the Russians own the North Pole? North Pole, Arctic Ocean are in Russia territory. It says that... the Canadians and the Finnish also claim it. Huh. Wrong. Only Russian territory. Only our territory. We have flag. Where's the flag? Bottom ocean under North Pole. We're gonna see Santa Claus! Shh! That's why most people come through here. No other reason. You don't want to live there. Why? Passports, please. Yeah, sure. Here you go, sir. What's he doing, Daddy? Thank you.Thank you. Have a good day. Spasiba. Don't you need to see Kyle's and Elroy's passports? Um... Who Elroy and Kyle? Her imagination. Elroy's in the glove compartment, and Kyle's in the trunk. Her imaginary friends. You may go. Say hello to Santa for me, please. We will. Bye. Hmm. Look at that. It's amazing. Pretty cool. You don't see that in Santa Barbara. Pretty cool. Yeah, it's snowing, all right. Can you see where you're going, Daddy? It'’s okay. I can see all right. The brakes are shot. Brakes are shot! What does that mean? Means we can't stop. I told you we should have seen a mechanic. No. I can't stop the car! Elroy! Elroy! Elroy! Elroy! - Elroy! - Elroy, Come on! - Elroy! - Elroy! Suzie, it's okay! Elroy! Elroy! ♪ ...virgin mother and child♪ ♪ Holy infant♪ Brace yourself! ♪ So tender and mild♪ ♪ Sleep in heav--♪ Suzie! Open your eyes. Look. Suzie, what do you see? We're flying! We're flying! All just part of the plan. Thanks, Elroy. We're flying? I'm scared of heights! Wow. Karen. Yes? What do you make of that? The DNA is showing chromosomes from all races. According to this chart, the DNA is over 1,000 years old. A 1,000 years old? Yes. A 1,000 years old. That can't be right. There has to be a mistake somewhere. Thank you.You're welcome. I did not sign up for this. Leroy, we're in the middle of nowhere. It's Elroy. Yes. Where'd he go? Where did he go? There's nothing here but a stupid snowman. I am not stupid. As a matter of fact, I'm extremely intelligent. A talking--Did you know that the square root of 3,558 is 59.6... 6... Bless you. Bless you. Bless you? Bless you. Thank you. Do you have a cold? I'm a snowman. I've always got a cold. I love sno-cones. Me, too. Daddy, what's happening? Hello! What's this-- Now what's-- what's that? Wow. Whoa. Ah... Wow! Welcome to the North Pole, the land of Christmas wishes and candy cane kisses. You just missed Santa. In fact, he's gone to return your dog, and he'll be back soon. California's not that far for Santa and his sleigh. Lickety-split and he'll be back in a bit. Lickety-split, he'll be back in a bit! Do you like living here where it's Christmas all year long, Mrs. Claus? Oh, yes, Tommy, and you can call me Carole. Would you like more hot chocolate? Yes, please, Christmas Carole. I'm sure you're looking forward to meeting Santa. Oh, you know, you're all here. I hope there's somebody at home. Oh, no. Now, now, now, now, don't get excited! Calm down. Calm down, please. Please. I-- I'm returning your dog. I took him by mistake. I accidentally took him in my bag, and I-- I had no idea that he was there until I got to the Pole. I don't know how to explain it, but relax. Are you okay, Kyle? I'm okay, Suzie. Thanks again for saving me from that car. That was nothing. Kyle, why do you cover up, even your hands? Oh, I like to be like Santa Claus. No, really, why? Well... no one really wants to see me. I'm... hideous. No, you're not. Is it because you got burned saving that family? You should be proud. You saved a family. But I got scars. Those are proof you're a hero. What happened? You really want to know? Well... it was a very cold Christmas Eve about five years ago, and I had just bought my wife a nice beautiful necklace. She was-- Ahem. So... then I hear screaming, and I-- I look up, and I see smoke coming out of a second-floor apartment. I go running up the stairs. I wasn't even thinking. And there the living room is completely engulfed in flames. The Christmas tree is ablaze. The ceiling has got fire lapping all the way across it. And I run in. I find the family. I get 'em out, and it's then we realize that the daughter's not there. The daughter was still inside. So I go back in. I find her. I pull her out just as the Christmas tree falls, and then I'm on fire. I had third-degree burns over 70 % of my body. I was in the hospital for three months. I almost didn't make it. So you wear the Santa suit to cover up your burns? It's like people showing off their tattoos. You should be proud. These are skin grafts from parts of my body that weren't burned. I think these are my legs. They don't look that bad. Yeah, but now when my butt itches, I scratch my forehead. Suzie! Santa! Hello, Suzie! Oh, I'm so sorry for the mix-up with your dog. I didn't mean to steal him.I forgive you. Thank you, Suzie. That means a lot to me. And you're looking good, Nathan. Hi.And Tommy. My goodness. I bet you're chasing off the girls now, aren't you? And Kyle, Kyle. You haven't changed a bit. Suzie, can I see your dodo for a minute? You'll give him back, right? Oh... I'll give him back, certainly. Let's see now. Let's see. So your daddy designed him, huh? Yeah. I love Mister Dodo. You got something here, Nathan. Thanks, Santa. But he's missing something. - Yeah. - I've got an idea. This just might bring him over the top. Leroy! It's Elroy. What's up, boss? Uh, well, uh, you're still in charge of the electronic chip department? Sure am.Well, I, uh, I've got an assignment for you. Okay. Be patient. Be patient. He'll return shortly. That was fast. Thank you. All right, here you go, Suzie. Ask Mister Dodo... - a question. - A question? What kind of question? Well, any-- any question you want. Mister Dodo, where is the North Pole located? There are actually two North Poles. One is the North Pole, Alaska, and the other North Pole, often associated with Santa's workshop, is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. Wow. I knew that. Of course you did. You're no dodo. You made him into an interactive educational toy for children? - That's so cool. - Yeah. That's brilliant. I only enhanced your creative creation. - Hmm. - Yeah. Mister Dodo, how far is the North Pole in the Arctic region from California? The middle of the Arctic Ocean to the northern state line of California is approximately 5,623 miles or 9,049.3 kilometers. That's amazing. - Thank you, Mister Dodo. - You're welcome. I love it. Now you are no longer a dodo. He called you a dodo. Whoa! What's that? Whoa! Well... What was that? Happening a lot lately. Little tremors. Earthquakes in the North Pole? Not earthquakes. They're tremors from the ice caps melting here in the North Pole. Why are they melting? One day, the North Pole will eventually be ice-free from the Arctic ice shrinking due to climate changes, often referred to as global warming. Yes, the Dodo's absolutely right. That's awful. Ice-quakes. I-I've heard of those. If this continues, eventually my workshop, my elves, and I will fall into the Arctic Ocean and be swept away forever. If this were to happen, who would bring presents to all the good boys and girls? Heh. Christmas would cease to exist. We can't let that happen. I'll help stop it, Santa. Well, when you get home, you need to spread the word. You need to let people know. Will you do that for me, Suzie? Yes, Santa, I promise. You're a good girl, Suzie. I know. You've always been on my good list. You're a good girl. For continuing to believe in me and the magic and for being a good father to both Tommy and Suzie, I award you this medal. Wow. Ah, "Good Boy!" Thank you. For being a good son and a good brother... Tommy. ...and for helping your father in his journey to rescue your dog, Rusty, I award you this medallion. Thanks, Santa. Cool. And... now to my little Suzie. For your courage, bravery, and keeping your father and brother in check, I present you with this highest honor from the North Pole. "Good Girl!" Good girl. Ha ha. Good girl. Good way to go, Suzie. I promise not to let you down. I'll spread the word for everyone to stop global warming. I promise your home will not melt into the ocean. Ah! Ho ho ho ho! Thank you, Suzie! I know I can count on you. And now to Kyle. Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle. Kyle. Kyle, Kyle, Kyle. Your turn, Kyle. For your bravery... in rescuing an innocent family from their burning home... ...after their Christmas tree accidentally caught on fire, I award you this medallion. It says, "Good Boy!" Good boy, Kyle. And for your actions in stealing this wonderful family's luggage, taking Elroy's North Pole magnet and anything else that's not glued down... Yeah, not glued down. ...I award you this second honor. Way to go, Kyle! It says, "Bad Boy!" Bad boy, Kyle. I'm not finished with you yet, Kyle. And for your unique devotion to me... and the spirit of Christmas-- Where, um-- Oh. Thank you, Elfis. Thank you very much. Thank you, Elfis. I award you the honor of Santa of the Bad Girls and Boys. Wow! You shall now have the job of visiting bad girls and boys all over the world and leaving a lump of coal in their stockings. This will allow me to be more efficient in my time visiting all the good boys and girls - who deserve presents. - I deserve presents. Does this mean I get my own sleigh and reindeer? You'll get your own toboggan sled and donkeys. Donkeys? Thank you so much, Santa. I promise, I won't let you down. Ah, congratulations to you all!
