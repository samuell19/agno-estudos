(calm ambient music) The sensation of my experience of shuttle reentry or usually somewhere around 250, 300 thousand feet. Go back to bed. (sighing) I miss him too, baby. He's looking down on us right now and I'm sure he's saying "Cassie, go back to bed." (chuckling) He used to play with your little ears. And you would fall right to sleep. I'm hearing those sounds again. And it's not my imagination. I know the difference between imagining something and hearing something. Okay, honey, I believe you but I still need you to get some sleep. No, you don't. You're just saying that to make me go to bed. I bet daddy saw aliens when he went into space. Baby, there is no proof of that yet. But who knows, maybe one day we will find out that there's other life out there. I'm gonna prove it one day. I'm gonna be an astronaut like daddy. (somber music) Hi, I'm Cassie. I know that started off a little dramatic but I like space. These are my friends. We call ourselves 62-F named after a planet the satellite Keppler found. Me and my friends like everything space Some say I have an old soul. Maybe I do, but I'm just not silly enough to think we're floating around in space alone. (upbeat music) Booyah, I win again. That's not fair, Hyke, you're the tallest and you have snake legs. Don't be a sore loser, Nina. Be quiet, Trane. But he's right Nina. Don't be such a sore loser. (splashing) So Trane, you still think that the moon landing was fake? Yep, definitely fake. Tons of Youtube videos support my theory. You need a Youtube cleanse. Ah, where's your proof? Uh, Youtube? (kids chuckling) (whooshing) BJ, you butthole. Bobby Jones for you. Only cool people call me BJ. And y'all ain't cool! That's right. The Palmdale boys run this town. TPB, baby! Y'all don't run us. What you gonna do, pretty boy? I got five dollars say you ain't gonna hit me. It's not worth it, Hyke. We can buy more kites. Yeah, man, let's go. Can we just go? I told you space junkies. This aqueduct is ours. Lake Palmdale is ours! Go fly a kite somewhere else. We can go where we want. Chill, Trane, it's not worth it. Let's just go. (ripping) Don't come back, you hear? I don't like him at all. He'll get over it. He's just mad 'cause he's fat and can't get any girls. Yeah, I heard he forced Mitchell and Red to go to the school dance with him 'cause he couldn't find a date. Yeah, the whole school was talking about it. Hey, what's everybody's plan for spring break? None of us are going out of town like last year so we should plan some fun stuff. And start by stargazing tonight? - I'm down. - Yeah, me too. (sighing) Okay, okay. As long as we don't stay out too late this time. My mom's been getting mad. Okay, see you guys tonight. Okay, see ya. - Later. - Bye. See you, Cassie. Bye, Nina. We didn't go stargazing that night. Instead we found something interesting. Come around, come around. There's so many stars. Shh. We'll be fine. Okay. (slightly tense music) Uh, guys? It says "classified." Why are we even opening this?! "If you're reading this, it means I'm in prison "or no longer here. "I hope my wife Mariposa, my daughter Cassie, "or someone in my family, "or someone with a love for humanity has found this. "What I'm about to tell you will sound unbelievable "but I assure you it's the truth. "There are alien beings out there in the universe. "I've met and communicated with them firsthand "on several missions. My dad talked and met aliens. I told my mom. "On our last mission, something bad happened, "and as a result we obtained a pentagon "with a star inserted inside. "I later discovered that it's being used "on our planet for weather control by certain entities "within our government "and corporations for financial gains. "Although I have the star, the pentagon "still needs to be recovered and both returned "back to Sentai Red Planet One, "what we know on planet Earth as Keppler 62-F. "Too many innocent people have died "from the misuse of this power. "That could have been avoided. "And it's up to you to stop it. "One love, Commander Carlton H. Howard, "Shuttle Venture mission STS207. Whoa. I'm blown away right now. This, this is unbelievable. We can change history with this. (speaking in foreign language) I knew we shouldn't have opened that safe. Okay, um. Gotta be some instructions in this thing or something. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Slow your roll. You think we're actually going to do this? Are you (speaking in foreign language)? Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Go, go look at this. Uh guys. Guys! What, Coltrane? I'm thinking. The star, remember? (sighing) Right. The star, of course. Did you guys see that? Or hear that? It's making those noises I hear at night. What, the? What noises? I'm confused. I think you just turned it on. (speaking in foreign language) At night I hear these noises. I saw a vision of something when I touched it. Of what? I don't hear anything. You know what, let me try. I'm not getting any visions. Maybe it only responds to girls or something. - Right. - Here, let Nina try. Uh, uh, no way. I am so not touching that thing. Nina, come on. We have to see how this works. Fine. I'll close my eyes, just take my hand and touch it. Well? Did you see or hear anything? No, what on earth are you talking about? Let me try it again. See? There it is again. - What? - And the sound. We need to get this back to my place for analysis ASAP. My dad said to get it back to Sentai Red One. And how are we supposed to do that, Cassie? I don't know. But we have to find out. Sounds like a plan. Well, let's go. So I know what you're thinking. How did we get my dad's classified papers? Well, we're kids. How do you think we got them? Mom, can you put a pizza in for me? Yeah, sure. Can you put those clothes away in my room for me? Why? It's your clothes, that's no fair. It's your stomach, that's no fair. (sighing) (droning sound) Mom, what's in that safe in your closet? I don't know, baby. It's your dad's old safe and I lost the combination. He always kept it private though so I've never looked into it. So the key to the entire universe could be in your closet and you never looked into it? Mom, come on. I highly doubt it, baby. It's probably old papers from work, who knows? Can I get it opened? Cassie, I'm not gonna call a locksmith to open that thing. It's a waste of time and money. I'll pay to get it open. I have money. Right, money you got from me. I do not want you wasting your money on that old safe. Please, mommy. It's been over five years. And if the key to the universe is in there, I would not want that responsibility anyway. I would. (steps clacking) (beeping) Hey, Coltrane, you still coming over tonight? 'Cause I need you for something else. What's going on? Well, I found a safe in my mom's closet that my dad left behind and I need to open it. My mom said it might have some of my dad's old work stuff in it. Hells yeah, sounds fun. What time? Hyke, she didn't ask you. She asked me. And besides, you couldn't open the safe if I gave you a million dollars. Ah, but if you gave me a million dollars, then I would just pay someone to open it. - (ka-chinging) - Genius. Hey, you can't open that safe, Cassie. What if something secret or bad is in there? That's the whole point, Nina. Nobody asked you anyways. Exactly. Nina, you don't have to come. I asked Coltrane. All right, Coltrane, I'ma meet you at Cassie's house later. Cassie, what time? About 10 o'clock? Hyke, be at my place at like 9:45. Okay. Guys. Thanks, guys. Okay, okay. I'll be there. 62-F out. Dude, it'll be so cool to meet an alien. No, it wouldn't. What if they don't like us? You've been watching too many movies, Nina. Remember ET? That was also a movie, duh. Oh, yeah. She's asleep. All right, let's do this. Whoa, Hyke, just Coltrane. You and Nina stay here. (mumbling) Haha. (snapping) Bloop. (kooky music) This is an old one, so it should be easier. Okay, hurry before she wakes up. Be careful, Trane! Okay. Shh, you're making me nervous. (beeping) (sighing) You're welcome. Close it and lock it. Lock it. Girls. What'd you guys find? Let's go up in the shuttle in case my mom wakes up. Yeah. I'll wait here. Come on. Okay, okay. (somber piano music) We have the star, now how do we get it back to the other planet? Take a seat. Hey, we have something to show you. We were looking up your dad's missions. What's this? We did a lot of digging to find this. Find what? The information I'm going to show you shows footage from the NASA video archives of mission STS207. This video proves that astronauts frequently encountered UFOs, aliens, and may have something to do with the death of eight astronauts. Some of you guys might remember the crash of Shuttle Venture that exploded over Florida just over five years ago. Its last mission was STS207. Surprisingly, that crew saw and filmed what you're about to see. Take a look at what they saw. This is unbelievable. Copy that. (radio chatter overrun by static) Yeah, we said that they had a bogey. Houston said, "Come again," he said, "We have a bogey". That's your dad. His mission, filming UFOs. The star probably belongs to whoever was following them. Probably? It does, and we have it. You don't know that for sure, Coltrane. I knew it. Hey, get out your star real quick. (zapping) (All) Whoa! (coughing) This thing is off the charts. How are we supposed to bring this thing back to Keppler 62-F? You mean Sentai Red Planet One. Look, I was reading the leftover papers that my dad left behind, and it doesn't say anything about taking the star back to the other planet. Okay, let's think about this for a sec. Okay, so what if your dad wanted us to get the star to an astronaut. He could take it to outer space, get it to the aliens and then they can take it back to Sentai Red. That makes sense to me, Cassie. No. No, it doesn't. I mean, how do we know that NASA didn't make it to Sentai Red? I mean, you know that they lie about everything. You're right, we don't know. But I still think we should just get it to an astronaut. And how are we supposed to do that, Hyke? Look in a newspaper? Wait. My dad said the we need to get the pentagon also. Not necessarily. We could just get the star back to the aliens because without the star, the pentagon doesn't work anyway. Do you still get those visions when you touch it? Yeah, I mean. I always see the same building. What does it look like? And why have you not mentioned this before? I don't know. It's not clear. Then keep on touching it till it gets clear. Okay, okay. Everybody just calm down. Okay. (tone ringing) What do you see? A brown building. Can you describe it? A brown building. It's just a brown building. Okay, Coltrane, look up brown buildings in Palmdale and see what you find. Okay. Just give me a second. What happened to the things kids used to do like play video games and watch TV instead of looking at brown buildings? Okay. Anything look familiar? Not really. Touch it again. Maybe it'll get better. (sighing) (tone ringing) Airplanes. Look up airplanes. Okay, come on. You never mentioned anything about an airplane either. Just saying. That's because it's a new image. Let me see. Airplanes. That. That's exactly what the image looks like in my head. Okay, let's see. Okay. Where is it? It says Joe Davies Heritage Airpark. That must be the place, let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What if we go and it's not there? Think positive, Nina. What if it is there? So, you think whoever has the pentagon will just hand it over? Nope. Probably not. But we'll get it. Trust me. I don't trust you, that's the problem. Nina. You heard what my dad said. We just can't let this get into the wrong hands. We need to do something. She's right. Trane, you have the address? Already in my phone. It says three hours walking, no. One hour on our bikes. And 40 minutes by train. Okay, we're gonna take the train. It's way too hot outside. (Coltrane and Hyke) Yeah. (birds chirping) (clearing throat) Where do you kids think you're going? Where the train is going, Lancaster. Well, not today, it's closed. Ah, well why is it closed? Because the train is stuck on the track. Man. You kids are too young anyway. I couldn't let you on if it was open. Yeah we are, we checked. Coltrane, are you sure you've got the information right? I'm pretty sure. You checked, huh? Well, you can't get on anyway. Now, get out of here. (chuckling) (kooky music) (brakes squeaking) How far did you say this place was? An hour. Can we rest first? I'm gonna die of a heat stroke! We have to get to the building before it closes, you know. Good point, go faster. Let's just keep going. (speaking in foreign language) can we stop and take a break? You know, that's the first thing you said that I actually agree with. Oh, thank you. Thanks. How much longer, Trane? Let me check. It says it's about 30 minutes left. Good. I'm tired. Uh, that wasn't even five minutes. Come on. Ugh! (kooky music) (cars zooming) It looks closed, Cassie. Yeah. We're too late. (clanging) Hello! Hello! Let it go, Hyke. There's no one here, we're too late. It's closed. Let's go. Can we rest first? We're not robots. Cassie, before we go, why don't you try touching the star again? Yeah, maybe it'll show you something that'll take us somewhere else other than... (tone ringing) I see a bunch of stuff, but, I don't know what it is. See, the star doesn't work. We come here and the visions are blurry. It probably doesn't work because you're here. Or because you're short. Let's go, forget about resting. Cassie, just try the star again. Cassie isn't getting her visions from that stupid star. It's not a stupid star, Nina. It's a star my dad left for me. You know what, you need to chill. You know what, whatever. It's not cool, Nina. Sorry, Cassie, she doesn't get it. Yeah, forget her. Whatever. We don't need her anyway. You know what, maybe Nina's right. This is a waste of time. She's wrong, Cassie. We're gonna find the pentagon with the star and get it back to Keppler 62-F. Yeah, we're with you. You can't give up just because Nina's being mean. You're better than that. We're the kids from 62-F, remember? (somber piano music) I wonder where they're going and what they look like up close. My dad knew where they were going. I'm sure he did. Sorry about earlier, Cassie. I wasn't trying to be mean. It's just, it was hot and I was tired. It's okay. I don't know what it's like to grow up without my dad or even lose him. Apology accepted. Whatever you need me to do, just let me know. Anything? Anything. Well, for starters, I'd like some chocolate chip cookies. And some milk! - Yep. - So fat, Chuckie. Cookies and milk are not part of the mission, silly. They should be, they're delicious. Yeah, right. JK, let's just shake on this. It's not really enough for me. Hyke. Fine! (tone ringing) Whoa, cool! Do you guys hear that? No. I don't hear anything. Me neither. (tense music) Whoa, it's moving. Cassie, what did you do? Nothing, I didn't touch it. What are you doing? Cassie, be careful. (zapping) Wow. Are you guys seeing this? Yeah. Now, this is cool. (zapping) Wow. It was like an up close view of our solar system. Okay, I've never seen anything like that before. That was insane. The star floated. It floated in mid air like something out of a movie! Maybe it got a signal? Signal from where? From a UFO or a planet. They know it's here. That we have it? No, no. Cassie's right. The star connected to something up there. Let's just hope it's friendly. Let's just hope. (urgent music) Thousands of people around California say they saw a strange light. Residents from this Palmdale neighborhood said the beam stretched miles into the sky and appeared to come from the lake. Authorities say they didn't see the light but some of our viewers were able to capture footage from their cellphones. We spoke to the members of the space community and they say the footage seemed doctored. We'd like you to take a look at it and tell us what you think. Did you hear about that strange light? No, no I didn't. It's probably some made up thing again. People are always hoping to see something. Yeah. So, how's spring break going for you, baby? Anything exciting happening? No. No, nothing exciting. Mmm, that's too bad. You guys should find a new adventure to get into. We're trying to figure something out that will be adventurous and fun. Well, let me know if I can help. Mom, why don't you believe in UFOs and other planets? Uh, Cassie. Me and your father would debate about this all the time. There's just no solid proof. What about all those Youtube videos? Those are fake, baby. People doctor those with effects similar to what's used in the movie business. But you don't know that for sure. You sound just like your father. You two are just alike. Daddy saw and communicated with aliens. That's nonsense, Cassie. (sighing) There was this video floating around on Youtube a while ago that was supposedly from his mission of them being followed by UFOs. But NASA proved that the video was fake. Seriously? Mhmm. Yeah. (doorbell ringing) Go answer the door. It'll probably be your friends. Mom! They're from NASA, mom. Hi, can I help you? - Mrs. Howard? - Yeah. Sorry to bother you, ma'am. No, it's okay. We were wondering if, how can I put this? We know your husband passed a while ago. - Yeah, five years ago. - Right. Did he leave with you any sensitive information or anything classified which was never returned to us at NASA? Not that I know of. And do you know about a bank vault or a safe you never looked into, or... There is a safe. Would you mind if we took a look at that safe? Sure, but I don't have the key or the combination for it. That won't be a problem, ma'am. I'm sure we can get it open. We don't mean to be pushy but your husband may have left behind sensitive information that if got into the wrong hands, it could be dangerous. I totally understand, follow me. It's in our room in the closet. Do you mind if we have a moment with the safe? Alone? Uh, okay. We'll just wait outside. (chuckling) (zapping) (beeping) That's strange. Very strange. Sorry about that, guys. I wish we could have been more help. No, no problem. My daughter was wondering about that safe. So you've actually helped us. Now she can put her little mind at ease. And what were you wondering, little lady? Oh, nothing. She just misses her father and was wondering what he left in the safe. But I told her not to bother it. I see. There's no way she could have opened it. Exactly. Well, thank you for your time, ma'am. And sorry to have bothered you. If you happen to stumble upon any classified information and things you don't understand, don't look at it. Give us a call. Will do. (gate slamming) Whoa. That's interesting. Following in her father's footsteps. I wonder what that was about. They were looking for something important. Well, I'm glad they didn't find it here. Can I call up my friends to see if they can meet up? Yeah. Be careful. That's a cool tent. I think the kid knows something. According to NASA, that light signal came from here. Coordinates lead here. Why did Commander Howard leave an empty safe? If she has it, how did she get it open? Something quite peculiar about that little girl. I don't think she has it. What are we gonna tell NASA? We tell them it's gone. Listen, this is our deal now! Forget NASA! They've got government money. That star's a part of my retirement plan and my wife don't like broken promises. (car starting) These two weird looking NASA guys came by earlier to open my dad's safe. Oh snap, for real? They asked my mom all these questions about the classified papers. How much you wanna bet they have the pentagon? But why would they come to my house to find the stuff? I mean, how did they know where to find us? Duh, because of the huge light from last night. Maybe the star is signaling the pentagon. No, but if it was, then they would have known that it was at Cassie's house. How do we know that though? Maybe the star works off of energies or something. Or they just got a lucky guess and came to my house. They'll probably be back. They will be back. And we need to be ready if the star is sending them signals. (tense music) Well, what do we have here? I thought I told y'all. This aqueduct belongs to us. Maybe we need to teach the space kids a lesson, BJ. What's this? Give it back! What's this, some made up classified stuff you guys photoshopped? Those are very impor... Nah, they're photoshopped papers, man, nothing important. You could photoshop some new ones. No! My dad's papers! (ripping) Those are my dad's papers! And they're tasty! (laughing) Just give it back! You heard her, give it back. Or what? - (bashing) - Get him, BJ, get him! Get him, Hyke! Get him off me! Get him off me! Get him, Hyke! Get him off me, get him off me! - Get him off me. - Get off him, stop it, stop! Hey. Check this out. Next time, I'll break your arm. You're not getting this backpack back or the star. You can't take that backpack. You want some next? Me and you can go one on one, too. Man, let's go. Give it back! Don't worry about it, Cassie. We'll get them back. What a punk. Thanks for standing up for me, guys. What a gross slob. Can't we just offer him like a free pizza for life or something and get it back? Haha, very funny, Trane, but I don't think that will work. I mean it might. We're getting the star back, pizza or not. (somber piano music) We're gonna get it back, dad. I promise. (tone ringing) Guys, be careful. (Nina screaming) Wait, I got this. Trane, this van is cool. Maybe you could be some help. Maybe? Yeah, right. This mystery won't be done without Trane. No tracks without the train. That's not how the saying goes. No, this goes right here. (tense music) I'll go. Okay. You guys stay on the lookout. If he comes back, distract him. With what? I don't know, dangle a chocolate chip cookie in front of his face or something, brr. Be careful and hurry up. (speaking in foreign language) I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm keeping everything crossed. Even my toes are crossed. Yes, yes! - God, we got so lucky. - I know. - Yes! - Got it. Operation Retrieve the Star is a success! - Bravo, good job, Hyke! - Let's go! Finally! What is this, Hyke? You didn't check the bag before you left the house? No, I didn't check the bag. It's Cassie's bag, why would I check it? Because BJ could have probably taken the bag and put something else in it. Which he did! Why didn't you check the bag, Hyke? Ugh, how much of a lamebrain can you be? Hey, I'm not a lamebrain! Wow, what a nitwit! (speaking in foreign language) You know what, I'm done, I'm done. I'm sick of you people always making me do everything and then blaming me for everything. And if you people had done a little bit of work and helped me, maybe this wouldn't have happened! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You volunteered, we agreed! You know, what are you doing putting cookies in the backpack anyway? I don't know. He's probably on a diet and he's hiding food from his parents. You know what, I grabbed the bag and I ran with it. My bad for not checking it. Ugh! Take the cookies! Thank you I will! And I'm not sharing! (tense music) He's home. I think we should all go in this time. Whoa, whoa, whoa, we? You mean Hyke. I agree with Trane. It's his fault we're back here anyway. Just chill, I got this. Be careful. Crap, oh, oh, ah, Jesus. Oh, oh, there we go. (farting) Oh, there we go. Wait, wait, it's not done. Oh, damn, damn. (farting) There we go. (toilet flushing) (knocking and buzzer ringing) What the...? "We are coming for you." Somebody playing games with Bobby Jones? Well, I'll be waiting for you! Man, it was right behind me in the closet and I didn't even see it. I feel like throwing up right now. I almost threw up when BJ walked in the room and you were in the closet. Yeah, if it weren't for me ringing the doorbell you would have been chop suey. Yeah dude, that was good thinking. Not really. We still don't have the star. We should be celebrating after we get the star. - True. - All right. (calm music) If we don't see any UFOs after the first hour, I'm going home. Hmm, well, if you stay we'll have an earthquake so that sounds like a good idea. Funny Trane, and if you stay, no UFO's will show up. Ow. Stop playing, Trane. Stop playing what, Cassie? Someone threw something at me. Oh, really? Really, dude? That hit me, jerk. (Nina giggling) I'm not throwing anything. Coltrane, stop. Learn how to take a joke. Ow! Okay, what are you guys talking about? That one hit me this time. Okay, someone is playing games. Seriously? Who is that? Hello? Can we help you? Don't be scared. Come out. Come out. Okay. Okay, either those are costumes or we're looking at aliens. Guys? I'm scared. We won't hurt you. Cassie, wait. Let them come to us. But what if they hurt us, Cassie? Nina, this would be the best time to stay positive. They're looking at me strange. Uh, we come in peace. They would say that, Hyke, not us. Oh, yeah. Come on. We'll be your friends. We won't hurt you. Dude, these are real aliens. I wonder what planet they're from. Do you guys speak our language? Can you speak English? (clinking) Smartphones? Everyone get out your smartphones. I got mine. Ugh. - I left mine. - Same. Right, the translation app. Download it at the app store ASAP. Okay, but we don't know their language so how are we gonna send them messages? (chiming) And it's downloading. We just got alien phone numbers. This is cool. Yeah. Cassie, you ask all the questions. They seem to like you. Okay. My God, where do I (mumbling) Okay, obvious questions first. What planet are you guys from? Yeah, I think they talk but without talking. Yeah. It's called telepathy, Nina. I can do it sometimes. Hey. Yeah, right. "We are from Sentai Red Planet One. "What you humans on planet Earth call Keppler 62-F." So is this who your dad met with? Ask them, Cassie. We have a space club named after your planet. It's called the Kids from 62-F. "Our parents knew your father. "He was a kind man, not of this Earth." When did you get here and why did you come? "We entered your atmosphere a few nights ago. "We're here to retrieve the star and pentagon "of Sentai One." This is much better than finding an astronaut. Um, okay? Talking, telepathy? What does the pentagon of Sentai One do? What is it for? "Along with the star, on our planet "it's used for energy. "Our existence depends on it. "On planet Earth, it's used for weather control." We had the star. And then a kid in our neighborhood took it. A bad kid. As for the pentagon, we don't know where it is. Can you help us find it? "Together we will find both. "We won't make it back to our planet without it. "It'll help us power our jet." - Whoa. - Nice. Cassie, find out their names. And what are your names? Pylar and Sylar. We will help you find the pentagon but there is something you will have to do for us as well. "What is it that you need? We will do it." Well, there are a lot of questions that we need the answers to on Earth that people don't know. Will you help us answer some of those questions? "We will try." Wait. They can't go walking around like this. They need disguises, duh. They already look like they're wearing disguises. Yeah, like permanent Halloween costumes. Exactly. Tonight, we paint the town. - TPB. - Yeah, it's about time we made a mark in the neighborhood. TPB for life. Hey, Red, can you grab me that can of black in the closet there? Man, you still have this dumb star? Bring that too, to throw in the lake.

This is the last time I'ma tell ya. You're not allowed by the lake. And who are these freaks in Halloween costumes? They look like those Avatar aliens, but worse. It'd be cool if it was Halloween! Give us back our star. Get off the lake. No. First, give us our star. We threw it in the lake. And you're gonna be next if you don't get off. We're not leaving without our star. Well, looks like you're gonna have to go fishing, Hyke. This is the last time I'ma tell you. You gotta leave or we're gonna drag you off one by one. Okay, who's first? What the...? I can't move. What, what the...? I can't move! Me either, I'm stuck, I can't feel anything. Let me go, please. I'm sorry, you could be on the lake. I was playing, please. Let me go, please, please. Just let me go. I was playing. (splashing) (laughing) (gasping) What are those things?! I don't know, man, I don't know. - Get out of here. - Let's get out of here! Run, little man, run! Thank you, Pylar and Sylar. You guys are awesome. Awesome sauce, Sylar. Wow, I wish I got to have powers like that. That was sick, you gotta teach us how to do that. Not in a million years though. High four, high four. Bam, nailed it. (airy music) This is just impossible. How are we supposed to find it? Anybody got scuba gear? Even if I had scuba gear, there's no way I'm diving into that thing. Yeah. Hey, Howard kid, what are you doing on the lake? Copy that, I got an issue around the lake. I'll be back at you in 20 or 30. This is a members only lake. It's private property. Uh, my mom is a member. No, checked her dues this morning when I saw your tent. Look, we're sorry. We just lost our star in the lake and we're trying to find it. Well, until her mom pays, you kids gotta get going. And whatever you lost, it's probably long gone. Listen, listen. Poop rolls downhill. My boss poops on me and I poop on you. Ugh. And the poop started this morning when I checked your dues. So you gotta get going. Hey Ricky, Ricky. I was trying to catch a trout down there, I ended up hooking this thing. Hey, that's our star. Well, I guess, here's your star, kid. - Thank you. - No problem. Great, now you found your star. Now get off the lake. Isn't it a little hot this time of year for a Halloween costume? - Uh, we're leaving. - Yeah. - We have a costume party later! - Hold on. What was...? Anyway. Didn't those two in the costume seem a little strange to you? I'd chalk that up to kids being kids. Tell me, how's the wife? Now we need to retrieve the pentagon. Do you still get those visions? I wasn't paying attention at the lake. Here, let me try again. I don't see anything. Whoa. This is way better than my visions. Those look like the guys that came to my house. "Those guys have the pentagon. "We need to retrieve it. "If we let them get the star, "a lot of people on your planet will suffer "from weather-related disasters." That looked like the Lake Palmdale Hotel. Well, how do you know? Because it said in front of the building. Yeah, Nina, pay attention, focus. Even I saw that. Give me a break. I am paying attention. I'll help you down. (kids mumbling) Guys? Uh-oh. Oh, no. Cassie? Give me the star. Those aren't nice aliens. You kids don't know what you're dealing with. (zapping) Yeah. We got cool toys too. We'll make this real easy for you. Give me the star and we go home and your alien friends can go back to their planet. Oh, yeah? Well, we can make it even easier. You give us the pentagon and you go home and forget about this. What pentagon? I don't know anything about a pentagon. Do you, Greenford? Nope. Never heard of it. Ugh, we're not stupid. We know why you want the star. Listen. NASA will be crawling all over this place with agents. All of you kids will be going to jail. Give us that star! You're lying, we're too young to go to jail. Yeah but not too young for juvie. Now give it to us. He's right, run. ♪ You can't beat the trailer park for fun ♪ ♪ So come on down ♪ Let's get them. ♪ Let me tell you about it ♪ Go! ♪ Up the lane on the sunny side ♪ ♪ Got a space by the pool in a double wide ♪ ♪ He smiles ♪ Go right, go right! ♪ Too prefabricated ♪ ♪ Cut the wife with the kids from around his neck ♪ ♪ But in life we defy ♪ Get them! Get them! (shouting) I want that star! Get that smile off your face! I can't help it. I know! So why do you keep asking? 'Cause there's a million dollars on the line and I don't want to see that smile until we get it! ♪ There's a space for every boy and girl ♪ ♪ Say goodbye to the way life ♪ (tense rock music) Hey! Here's the car. Let's see if the pentagon is in there. Yeah. Yeah. Good idea, but it's locked. Sylar, can you open the car for us? Got anything? No, nothing in here. Ew, it smells like meat in here. Like your brain, Coltrane. Haha, very funny. Guys, let's get out of here before they come back. Come on. (calm piano music) I know it's all for a good cause to save humanity, but, I mean is it really worth it if we die? We're not gonna die. Well I mean guys, we could, you know if we could maybe fail, the star gets into the wrong hands and you know, creates a hurricane in Palmdale or something. But my dad makes it all worth it. I'm doing this for him. Not to mention the people's lives we're saving. Yeah. Pylar and Sylar make it all worth it too. They're the coolest aliens I've ever met. Dude, just stop. You never met any aliens before, just stop. Pylar and Sylar, what's life like on your planet? What do kids do for fun? Are there mountains and oceans? Are there playgrounds and parks? "Yes, our planet is much like planet Earth. "We have higher mountains and bigger oceans. "We have parks and playgrounds but the universe "is our stage. "We get to fly and explore the universe "at an early age. "Much like you guys travel to different countries." Pylar, Sylar, how old are you guys? (All) (gasping) Three years old?! What? That is so cool. I wish I got to travel like that. That's amazing. But not that they're old, Coltrane, nobody is that smart at three years old. Duh. I mean one day we can travel like that though. Yeah, our grandkids will. But not us. You don't know that, Nina. "Humans can also share in this technology "but there's too much war in this planet. "Not until there is peace will you be able "to explore our universe. "If you bring war to the universe, "planet Earth will be destroyed for the greater good "of all the races in the galaxy." Pylar and Sylar, what do we need on Earth to learn this technology? I am ready to explore. So am I. Love. Unconditional love is the common thread that all the galaxies share and is lacking on this planet. Our government, they'll never understand that. You know I'm really starting to wish they would get with the program. Look who's being negative now. Love is possible on our planet. We just have to try. Yeah, I mean if we don't try, it'll never change. And the closest thing we get is the moon or Mars. And who cares about the moon or Mars? It's boring up there. And there's nothing for us to mess up. And that's why technology is only allowing us to go there. It all makes sense. All my dad ever wanted was to create peace in the world so that it would be a safer place for us to live in. Yeah. Can you guys get up? What do you want? I just wanted to say, I'm sorry. Lake Palmdale, the aqueduct belongs to all of us. Yeah. Yeah, okay, thanks bud. Yeah, okay, thanks man, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, okay, thanks fellas. Um, okay, thanks. Thanks, BJ. (sighing) Much love. See you guys around. (All) Okay? Wow. Is there something wrong with him? I have no idea what that was about. He took like a potion. Nuh-uh, uh-uh, ain't buying it, nope. (kooky music) Cassie, come here. Have a seat, I need to talk to you. Am I in trouble? I don't know, are you? No, I didn't do anything. Those two gentlemen from NASA came by earlier. And they said that you and your friends have something that belongs to them. They said it's a matter of national security and that I need to get it from you. Those guys are lying, mom. Well, that's not what they said. Oh, well what did they say it was? They said it was classified and something about a star? Now, how would me or my friends be walking around with something classified? He also said that you've been bringing aliens in the house. Now that, I don't believe. Aliens? Well, if you don't believe that then how could you possibly think that we have something classified that belongs to NASA? Mmm. Daddy's safe was empty. Yes, it was, I saw it. Is that it, mom? Ancient Alien is on and I wanna see it. Yes, that's it. But eat dinner first. What are we having? Spaghetti, your favorite. Ooh, can I make a plate and watch TV while I eat? Yes. Love you. Love you too. (bird chirping) Okay, stun guns ready. What? Don't worry, Nina, it won't kill them. It'll only give them a little jolt. It's barely 500,000 volts. Um, that sort of sounds like a lot. It's not, trust me. Yeah, it won't kill them. It'll only hurt them. That's comforting. We'll just hurt the NASA guys but not kill them. Okay. Duct tape, pepper spray. Pretty good, this should do it, Trane. Okay. Me and Hyke will be in charge of the stun guns. (cymbals ringing) Ladies, duct tape, pepper spray. This looks good, Trane. I also brought some flashlights. Thanks. Hopefully it's enough to stop them. Oh, ho, it's enough, trust me. Be careful with that. Bzzt. Well, what do we have here? Stun gun? Duct tape? Let's see yours. Come on (speaking in foreign language) Pepper spray? Those are all for the costume party. You know it's bad to lie to a police officer, right? Yeah. Let's see yours. (zipping) Now this is an interesting looking star. You know, had you kids told me the truth I would have let you go. But now I gotta call your parents and have them come pick you up. They're all staying with me for spring break. So my mom will pick us all up. That's fine with me. You guys have a seat on that curb over there. All right, what are your names? I'm Cassie. Cassie. Nina. Huh? Nina. Nina. Hyke. Hyke. Coltrane. Coltrane. What about you two? That's Pylar and Sylar. They don't speak English well. Pylar and Skylar. Sylar. Sylar. Cassie, what's your mother's phone number? 818-458-0423. And her name? Mariposa. Mariposa. Hello? Hi, Mariposa? Yeah, this is Officer Lee from the Palmdale Police Department. Yes, I have Cassie here with her friends down at Paloma Vista Park. Can you come and get them right away please? I'll explain when you get here, ma'am. Okay, see you soon. Now you kids should know better than to carry stun guns and pepper spray. (kooky music) Ah. Hey, where'd the two in the costumes go? I don't know, ask the mouse in your pocket. How the heck are we supposed to know? (kids giggling) Hey! Smart-aleck, huh? I'd rather not be a dumb-aleck so yeah. Ah, they were probably illegals. Not my jurisdiction, but they'll catch them especially dressed like that. Hot today, huh? It's not too bad. Ah. Cassie, what kind of car does your mom drive? A white Suburban. Well, is that her? Yup. Mariposa? - Yeah. - Hi, ma'am. It's all right here, self-explanatory. I am really disappointed with you kids. Stun guns and pepper spray? What are you kids thinking? Sorry, Mrs. Howard. Yeah, sorry. Really sorry, Mrs. Howard. Cassie, you are grounded for the rest of spring break. Yes, ma'am. You know there were two more in Halloween costumes. And I bet you they were illegal aliens. They disappeared. A star? I asked you about this, Cassie, and you lied to me. Let's go. (somber music) Have a good day, ma'am. Thanks, officer. We need to talk, little lady. I don't wanna talk. Well, you don't have a choice. So. Tell me about this star and the guys from NASA. You obviously know something you're not telling me. You won't believe me. You never believe me. Cassie, talk to me, please. Don't close up on me. I was told you had a star and that you have a star. Please talk to me, I will believe you. Okay. One night, when you were sleeping, me, Coltrane, Hyke, Nina, we all broke into daddy's safe. Oh, my God, while I was sleeping, Cassie? I'm sorry. Continue. And well, we found NASA's secret papers and the star. And what did these classified papers say? They just told us all about daddy meeting aliens and needing to get the pentagon and the star back to the other planet. Okay, so um, where are these classified papers? Some kids in the neighborhood tore them up. But we put them back together. - Right. - See? You don't believe me. I'm trying, baby. Uh, so, you and your friends are trying to get the star back to the other planet? Yes. Daddy left it for a reason. I'm supposed to finish his mission. You said he knew I'd do something great. Okay, okay. So how do you plan on doing this? Well, you know the aliens that the NASA guys talked about? They're real. Okay, now. That I don't believe. Would you like to meet them? What do you mean meet them? Meet who? Sylar, Pylar, you could come out now. Oh, my God. Uh. Thanks for bringing the papers. The papers. Mom. This is Pylar and Sylar. My friends from Sentai Red Planet One also known as Keppler 62-F. But how could a... Mom, it's okay, just sit down. Okay. Do they bite? No, mom. They're just like us, but better. They're here to bring the pentagon and the star back to their planet. Okay, right. Their parents knew daddy. "Nice to meet you. "Commander Howard spoke very highly of you." This is how we communicate, through this translation app. "You are just as beautiful as the picture "he showed us years ago." What? What picture is that? This is from our honeymoon. We were on our way to where the NASA guys are staying to get the pentagon. That's why we had the stun gun and pepper spray. I had no idea Carl was this involved with space exploration and aliens. Well, I didn't even know that aliens existed so, I wouldn't possibly know. Oh, my God. This is incredible. And all you've been trying to do is finish your dad's mission? I am so proud of you, baby. - You are? - Yes, very! I just, I just wonder why he kept this side of his life away from me. Well, it's classified, mom. And he probably thought that you weren't open to it like I did. Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm sorry. Can we have the star back? If I don't do this, daddy died in vain. Well, now I see why NASA wants it. It's not good. It belongs to them. Yes, yes, you can. And you and your friends, you must finish this mission. He says, "We will take care of Cassie. "She will come home safe. "We will not let anything happen to her." Please, take care of her. I don't know what I'd do if I would lost you, baby. I'll be fine, mom, I promise. But I need to finish this for daddy. Okay. I understand. You're not grounded. My daughter is friends with aliens. Ooh, okay, Mariposa. Take a deep breath. It's strange and it's out of this world but it's real, it says so right here. It says it right here, it's real. And I just saw it with my own eyes. Are you sure you guys want to sleep out here tonight? "Yes, we need access to the skies tonight." Okay. If you need anything you just let us know, okay? Mom, they're fine. Okay. Bye, you guys. Gotcha, gimme your phone! Take their sight, take their powers! (grunting) We're gonna get that star now. (tense music) (car starting) Pylar, Sylar, I... (tense music) Pylar, Sylar! Mom, the aliens are gone. I have to get the team together. - What!? - The aliens are gone! Wait! Can I do something? So you woke up and they were just gone? Yes. Maybe they just went for a walk or something. They wouldn't do that, Hyke. I know them. For like a day. Maybe they needed to run some errands. (phone beeping) You dirty dogs. Surprise, surprise! Every dog has its day. Even if he's dirty. Hah, laugh all you want but we'll find you. (laughing) Here, listen. We know the star has a hologram. We know it only works when the aliens use it so you won't find us. Try me. (laughing) Let me make this easier on you kids. Give us the star. We'll give your little alien friends back. How about you give us back the aliens or we come find you and take them back? (cackling) Where are you? Come and try it. Lake Palmdale Hotel, room 207. We have to rescue Pylar and Sylar. Okay, we all agree on that but we can't just give them the star. This is a catch 22 and I don't like catch 22s, period. This is a trick. They know they're not gonna give us the aliens without the star. I got a better plan. Cassie, call them back. (phone beeping) That was so fast, I almost passed gas! (laughing) Okay, we'll give you the star for the aliens but you're gonna have to come to us. It's easy. All you have to do is follow the signs to the star. That's easy. When is this little exchange supposed to happen? Tomorrow, this time. This had better be a good plan, dude. Yeah, this better be good. Oh, it is, it is. Gosh, I hope so. (drill whirring) They won't know what hit them. Okay so, we got about 15, yeah 15 minutes before they get here so let's get ready. Okay. Me and Hyke will be in charge of the stun guns and ladies, you get the pepper spray. Okay, so if the trap fails, we shock them, grab Pylar and Sylar and take off. Right. Okay, and I'm waiting at the end of the trail and then you guys jump in, we cool off in Lancaster. - Exactly. - Correct. Yup. Okay, I'm ready, high five me. Okay, let's go. (tense music) Oh, Pylar Sylar, oh, my gosh. You guys are early. Well, we wanted to surprise you. We wanted to get here early in case you made a trap for us. No traps, just an even trade. Where's the pentagon? Nice and safe, in the case. Let Pylar and Sylar go, and once we get them you can get the star. Pff, (laughing) You can't fire. You thought we wouldn't notice the trap? (laughing) Nathan! Look at the cute little strap they set for us! They almost had us. Almost had us! (laughing) Coochie coochie coochie. (laughing) Here, take the hoods off, be careful. Poor aliens. (zapping) Again, do it again! (men screaming) Hurry up! Go! - Wait, wait! - Yeah. (zapping) We got him! We did it, mom. We actually did it. Oh, yeah! I can't take all the credit. I got some help from BJ and his friends. Uh huh? Seriously? Look to your left. All right, let's get out of here before they wake up. (car starting) Good thinking, Trane. (zooming) Yeah, boy! - Great job, guys. - Gimme some. That's what I call teamwork. You kids are awesome. (zooming) (crashing) (laughing) Yeah! You won't get away from me! Go faster! Mom, go faster! (crashing) Go, go, go faster! (laughing) Mom, go faster! Okay, okay! (revving) You'll never get away from me! Wake up, they're getting away! Come on! Get out of the way. - Gas it! - Gas! Who does mom think she is? (zooming) (crashing) Oh, my God! (laughing) - Go! - Cassie's mom, gas it! Nathan! Wake up! (zooming) (beeping) Whoa! That is sick! (clanking) Nathan, you slept through a blown up car! (whimpering) Nathan! What are you people standing there for? Help us! We're from NASA! If it wasn't for us, Palmdale wouldn't even be here. Aliens wanted this place a long time ago! What? What are you...? Hey! Wait, that's government property! Hey! Okay, I know you guys are hungry. It's organic, guys, so eat up. Oh, thank you. I'm gonna miss you two. You guys are cool. Yeah, me too. Me three. Me four. "Don't be sad. This is a time to celebrate." You guys listen to music? ♪ We do it for love ♪ ♪ We do it ♪ "Music is the universal language." (hip hop music) Hey, my kind of alien! ♪ We do it ♪ ♪ We do it for love ♪ Woo! ♪ We do it ♪ Okay, I just have to join. ♪ We do it for love ♪ ♪ The moons and the stars of the galaxy ♪ Come on, Trane.

Yeah. It's been a real adventure with you guys. Yeah, it was cool to meet you guys. Yeah. It's cool to have alien amigos. So do you guys remember our deal? "Yes. What would you like to know?" Well, I wanna know about the pyramids in Egypt. Ask them about Area 51 too. Oh yeah, and Roswell. I wanna know if a UFO actually crash landed. Oh, wait, the moon landing. I wanna prove Coltrane wrong. And what about that face on Mars? "The Egyptians built the pyramids. "We only helped a little. "Area 51 is real, but it was relocated. "Roswell is real. "A UFO got lost in the galaxy and crash landed. "We learned about that in school. "The moon landing is real "but there was a lot they didn't reveal. "The face in Mars is real. "There was once life on Mars. "Then the race of people there destroyed it "similar to what's happening on Earth." Can we save planet Earth? "Yes, it will be in your generation. "Can we be part of your space club, 62-F?" Well guys, don't leave them hanging. (All) We are 62-F! "We love you." Aw, we love you guys, too. Goodbye, friends. We'll miss you. Remember, love is the key. (beeping) (ship humming) (dramatic music) (zooming) And just like that, Pylar and Sylar were gone. Hi, mommy. Hey, baby. What's wrong? Oh, uh nothing, I'm, I'm just missing your daddy. I'm sure he's saying right now, "Mommy, go to sleep." You're right. Let's go to sleep. I'll tuck you in, mommy. Thanks, baby. But you don't have to, mommy's a big girl. I know, but, I can tuck you in sometimes, too. That is sweet of you. You have a good night. I love you. Good night, mommy, love you, too.
