Oh god, please take it off! One More. Pull it out! C'mon, you're not doing it right! He can't breathe! You're hurting me! You're hurting me! Hey, I'm fucking serious! I'm serious, I'm fucking done here! We'll talk about you going home after you stop fucking breathing! - I want to go home. - Oh, he's scared! - No no no, please! No! I've made a mistake, I don't want to... Hello? Can you be ready tomorrow? Yes. Good. Your mission awaits you. I 100% agree with you. why we like physical media so much is in that era, which we've lost, whether you were the big budget Hollywood multimillion dollar movie or the super low budget Roger Corman film... Hi. Allie? Thank God! Where are you? Don't worry, I'm fine. No, listen to me. You're not fine! I know exactly what I'm doing. You just have to trust me. I don't know if I can trust you, because you're off your medication. I know you are. I've got them right here. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean for it to go so far. Just come home, please? I love you. Okay? I know I've never said that before, but I do. I wanna be deserving of you. You have nothing to be scared of. I'm the one who's scared. I'm the one who's been scared for so many years. Not after today. Allie, just stop. Wherever you are, just turn ar-- My name is Allison Bell. I'm making this video as a stipulation before entering Perdition. I cannot say where I am, but I can say that I am here of my own free will. Anything that happens inside Perdition is done with my full consent. I release Perdition and it's staff of any responsibility for whatever may occur during my visit. I'm here. Leave your phone and keys in the car. The back door is unlocked. Proceed to the ladies' room, you'll find a release form there. Sign it. God, this place is a shithole. Yeah, I think that's the point. I'm so fucking jealous I didn't get picked. I'll call you when I'm done. Love you. Fucking wicked, huh? Yeah. So this is it? I think so. - Zachary. - Allison. Let the fun begin. I can taste the asbestos already. There's a light down here. You ever do this before? - No, you? - First time. I'm supposed to go in there. - How do you know? - He told me. - Wow. Shouldn't you read that first? What's the fun in that? Oh, I'm not doing that. I will. Oh Jesus, it's real. What is it? Put these on. Cute. How do I look? - Get off of me! - No! Get off of me! Just watch it, alright? Easy, buddy. Fuck you, man! Somebody please help me! She's dying, I need your help! Oh my God! Come on baby! Do you know why you're here? Because female maintenance puts me in close proximity to razor blades? Yes. That is why you are here at this very moment. But why are you back here, after all these years? I don't know how you want me to answer that. Because I'm fucked up? I don't know. - You have unresolved issues. No one can blame you for that. But if you don't want to end up back here, or worse, you have to deal with them. Head on. What the fuck are they doing? Where- Shh. I can't hear. Your souls belong to Perdition now. Sit down. Sit the fuck down! Stay. Good little doggy! Welcome... to Perdition. - Am I being videotaped right now? You've seen our videos. Of course you are. Every moment of your experience is being documented. So those Chinese people--is that what they're here for? They're Japanese. And they're from Gashadokuro, you will treat them with the utmost respect. So is the world gonna see this? I chose you for this night. So consider it an honor. Why are you here? - I told you in my interview. No, you told me what scares you. That's not what I'm asking. I have unresolved issues. A fear. A darkness. And you want us to what? Literally scare the hell out of you? - I guess. - Any moron can scare you. It's easy. Is that was this is gonna be? Cheap tricks? Because that's gonna get really boring really fast - Boring? You have no idea where you are right now. No one does. We could be dangerous people. Could be killers. Really? You have a website and a YouTube channel. How dangerous can you be? - I will be many things. But boring will not be one of them. - Masks don't scare me. - Oh, we all wear masks, Allison. Even you. It's what's underneath that scares us. What scares you, Allison? I don't know if things scare me. Maybe I'm not being clear. What limits you? What holds you back from living? - I'm extremely claustrophobic? Lots of people hate small spaces, Allison. It's like being afraid of the dark, or spiders. Unless it comes from a real trauma. What else? This might sound weird, but..winter. You're scared of the winter? No, I'm not scared of winter. But it reminds me of my childhood. And I don't like to remember my childhood. Too many bad memories? Yeah, you could say that. Hello? Who's in here? Who's there?! I'm not scared of you! The darkness fucks with your mind. It plays tricks on the mind. It doesn't take long. Tonight, you have two people going through Perdition: Zachary and Allison. Why did you choose them, specifically? - All I can say is you'll see. It was a decision I came to very carefully. And after tonight, people will be talking about their visit for a very long time. Repeat after me: "I belong to Perdition now!" I belong to Perdition now. - I relinquish all control of my mind and my body to Perdition. - I relinquish all control of my mind and my body to Perdition. I am nothing now. I'm just a plaything of Perdition. - I am nothing now. I'm just a plaything of Perdition. Do with me whatever you wish. Do with me whatever you wish. - With enthusiasm! - Do with me whatever you wish! - Now take off your clothes. What? No. Take off your clothes! No. You bitch! Alright! Well, you don't wanna do it yourself, I gotta do it for you! Put those on. Take off everything. Take off the goddamn underwear. All of it. Now put those on. See, that wasn't so hard, now was it? Babe. Not right now. Just keep reading. I won't bother you. Seriously, I don't feel like it. I'm sorry. Don't do this to me. I'm not asking for much. I'm in love with an android. Don't be a bitch. Two months we haven't had sex. Does that sound normal to you? We're young. We have our own place. We could be doing it all day, every day, but I'm not asking for that. I'm just asking for a little bit of passion. Occasionally. Not once in a quarter. Don't! Get off me! What the fuck? Sorry. I didn't mean that. Listen, I get it. You don't have to explain yourself to me. You know it's not you. I know. Still doesn't make it easy. I'm gonna go out. You move you die. You love your girlfriend, but her touch disgusts you. No. No? Well, it's touch itself that disgusts you. One of our basic needs as humans. Don't be shy. Hey. did you cut yourself? Just give in. I know you want to. If you don't, something bad's gonna happen. Stop! Night Night! You're next! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Allison! Just do what I do, or you'll suffer. You both will. Stop! Stop. No! Stop. Look at me! Are you ready? Would you allow us to see your face? You told me there weren't gonna be any dogs! And for some reason, you believed us. First one to find the exit wins. Believe me. You don't want to lose. Twenty second head start, kids. Dog follows. Get going. Hey! Wait! Zachary! Help me! Help me, help me, help me! Looks like Zachary won. And so, he'll be rewarded. Which means you lose. It's a madhouse! Say it! Say it! It's a madhouse! It's a fucking madhouse! Say it! Say it! No! No! No, no, no! Please, no! No, I promise I'll be good! No, I can't! No! It's exactly why you're going to. Please! Please! No! Shhh. Dad! Let me out, please! Let me out, I promise I'll be good! Dad! No! Please! The more you scream, the worse it gets. That, I promise you. No, no. No! Let me out! What the hell is this? It's Jack Rabe's new movie. That underground filmmaker from Ohio I told you about? Are you fucking kidding me? What? Geez, it's just a movie. Is it? Yes, Erica. Watching horror doesn't make me deranged, which is how you make me feel. This isn't horror. This is different. And when you go after dark shit like this... I've seen it happen before. I'm only trying to help, okay? I don't need your help. Do you wanna end up back in the hospital? Is that what you want? This is fucking dark shit, Allie. Rape, torture, beheadings? What are you doing? Put those down! - I am! Quit being a fucking bitch! Get your fucking hands off me! Please don't go! Let me out! Help me! Help me! Let's just do it. Let's just do it. You're so beautiful. - Help me. - I need. Hello? Hello, Allison. Hi. I just finished watching your submission. I think you're an excellent candidate. Really? That's great. I need a letter from your doctor stating you're in good mental and physical condition. Can you do this? Yeah. That's no problem. What scares you, Allison? I don't know if things scare me. Maybe I'm not being clear. What limits you? What holds you back from living? I went to the website of this Perdition place. Checked it out. Honestly, Allison, I don't see any therapeutic value in it. Now, you asked me to look at the website, consider this as a therapy option. I looked at it. I read everything on that website, and I have considered this carefully. My answer is no. I strongly urge you not to go. And I absolutely cannot write you a letter of mental health. You have made significant progress over the past decade in the wake of traumatic events in your life. You've moved back into the world. You have an apartment, you're in a good relationship. Don't throw it all away over a dumb haunted house. It's not dumb. It's what I want. It's what I need. This infatuation with horror has the potential to derail all your progress. Horror is no better than pornography. It's smut, dressed up as entertainment. It serves no greater purpose. It's death, on sale. And on sale cheap. Allison? Allison? Allison? I'm going to forget we ever had this conversation. Do I have to schedule another evaluation? No, Dr. Nicholas, we don't. Okay. You forget about this. You'll thank me. Leave me alone! The dog's alive! Yeah! John Hainey, thirty-eight years old. Been with Perdition for... geez. Going on ten years now. This is Russell. This is pretty boy, Floyd. Prop gun. I used to work in special makeup effects. Underground films, mostly. You play how many characters? - Three. Beanie, Psycho Clown, and Gorilla. Now, the Gorilla is obviously the one closest to my own personality. When I first started, I was what we call White Skull. That's the entry-level position. Mainly grunt work. But after a year of that, I graduated character work. This gives me more of an opportunity to express myself artistically. Tell us your name. Phil Cutter. Been with Perdition ten years. What made you want to scare people? I served eight tours, Iraq and Afghanistan, and uh saw some bad shit, and this is therapy for me. How did you meet Bob? He was a struggling screenwriter when I met him. He was writing a Vietnam script, something for a military advisor. He was a friend of a friend so I helped out. The script went nowhere, but uh that was our first collaboration, and uh, he's an interesting guy. What unique skills do you bring Perdition? What do you want from us? What? Now listen carefully. It's a simple question. What do you want from us? I don't know what you mean. What do you want from us? I want you to push me to my limits! What are you- what are you doing to her? What are you doing to her?! Stop! What do you want from us, Allison? Stop! I want you to stop! That's the wrong answer. What do you want from us, Allison? I felt like I was drowning! You can't do this! Stop it! Stop it, you're gonna kill her! What do you want from us? I want you to make me face my fears! What fears? Daddy. - Stop, something's wrong with her! Stop! Allison. Allison, listen to me! Listen to me, you're having a panic attack, okay? I'm gonna say a sequence of numbers, and I want you to repeat them back to me, do you understand? Now listen, here we go, here we go 2, 5, 4, 6, 0, 8, 9. - Six, oh, eight. - Yeah What's happening? Don't worry. It's all under control. It's okay. 6, 8, 4, 1, 3, 7, 2. 6, 8, 5 --no, 4, 4... - Calm down, calm down. it's okay. one Take it easy. It's alright. It's alright. Stop. Stop! Let go of me! Help! Stop! Let go! Get off of him! Why'd you say "Daddy"? Because I'm fucked up, okay? Now we're getting somewhere. Why are you here? To see what I'm capable of! Yeah, why? 'Cause I'm afraid. - Of what? That I'll never amount to anything! - Chill Hipster brain, come up with that shit all on your own? No. - Yeah From my parents. Sounds like they know you pretty well. What else they have to say? That I'm not strong enough. That I'm weak. I'm... I'm - a loser! - Keep going! Hey! Oh, you ready to talk now? Yeah. Alright. You ready to tell me what I wanna hear? Yeah. Well I'm all ears. Oh, shit! Did you see that? Fuck! I got a treat for you, honey. - No! No! No! No! No! No! I'm drowning! Shut up and drown, then! Tell me about your father. Go to Hell! I'm not playing. - Why should I tell you? You're just some fucking loser in a mask! I can't help you. Fuck! God, this mask can go fuck itself, I'm tired of this thing. You know, I shoulda been fucking Peep Show Girl. I'm way hotter than that bitch anyway and then she just comes in like, "I'm Hainey's wife! I should be Peep Show Girl!" Fucking stupid bitch. What's wrong? You okay? Look at me. Who's your sister? Who loves you? You bet your ass I do. We're gonna get outta here soon, okay? Just temporary. Grab a gun. I love the way I look. Help! Help me! Help! You see this? That there is Boticelli's map of hell Now, Perdition, that's my hell. For the time, yours too. See, the crime that got me here, well, that was cowardice Didn't even get me to the top of the first circle. Now see I'm... I'm just outside the gates, right there. So, every day, I have to pay for my sins. My family would go on vacation in New Jersey every summer. Wild Wood. My mom, my dad, and my brother Joey. See, Joey, he was two years older than me. His favorite ride was... was always the haunted houses. I'm scared to hell of it, he would tease me. Until I eventually agreed to go on the ride with him. But even then, I just, I just still just, I closed my eyes the entire ride, right. But the scariest one of them all was called the Pit of Doom. One night, while we were there, it burned. Joey and I were on that ride when it went down. Halfway through the ride, we stopped. Lights went out. Smoke was everywhere. The place it, it... was engulfed in seconds, really but a man with a flashlight came by. Found us. He pulled us out of the car. He told us, told us to hold hands. "Don't let go!" he said. So he held mine, and I held Joey's. He lead us through this, this burning maze. Searching for a way out but we couldn't breath, and we couldn't see. It was then that Joey's hand slipped from my grasp. And I didn't say. A thing. I was too afraid, hmmm? Yeah. So I just kept moving on, kept getting pulled forward, and then it wasn't until we were outside when they realized that Joey was no longer behind me. By then it was too late. Place was an inferno. They didn't blame me though. I was just a kid, right? I could've said something. I could've done something. I let Joey die, because I was too afraid. Because I wanted to stay alive. What did he do to you? I don't remember. How bad was it? Allison. Answer the question. I can't. I can't. Please, I can't. Okay. Then back under you go. Let me in! Open this door right now! Right now! Leave me alone. What did I tell you about locking the door? Get up! Take it off now! Is that why you had that door locked? Take it off! That's right cry! How did you process your mother's passing? How do you think I processed it? I was ten. It sucked. Cancer's a bitch, right? I was under the impression your mother took her own life. That's one way to see it, sure. But that's not how I saw it. How do you see it? She was just desperate for a way out. The cancer was there, alright. Not something you could see under a microscope but, it was there, eating away at everything. He let it in. Your father? The monster. And how did he react to her death? I know you don't want to discus these things but these issues should've been dealt with earlier. I was hospitalized for two years, I think I dealt with them. Not properly, or you wouldn't be back here, now would you? He drank more. And that's saying something. And how did this behavior affect you at the time? It's hard to remember. But it's there. It's always there. What is? The weight. The gnashing in my stomach. The poison in my veins. And it's his blood, too. And it's black, and it's vile! And the more I have to fucking think about it, the more I want to scratch my fucking eyes out! Very good. Now we're getting somewhere. Why'd you pick her? I told you, she looked better than anyone else. There's something you're not telling me. Can't reveal all my secrets, can I? She broke my nose, man! And you're just gonna what. cry about it? How about I break your nose, fucker, and we see how much you like it? You know how the game is played. I'm the only one who knows all the cards. If you don't like it, then don't play. There's something wrong with her. Look, this is her paperwork, right here, okay? There's a fucking doctor's note in there, read it if you don't believe me. Get rid of her. You know I can't do that, not with the crew here. Send her home. I need her here tonight. And right now, she's putting on one hell of a show, okay? Don't you get it? I'm trying to take us to the next fucking level. Everything is riding on this. Perdition, it should be the best. And we should be enjoying the splendors of the best, But no, I have fourteen fucking dollars in my name, and I'm eating macaroni and fucking cheese! And you can't help but pick the most unstable, batshit crazy bitch you could find, right? And you poke around in that fragile brain of hers, just to see what fireworks might go off? What happened to helping people, Bob? If you don't like how I'm running things, then go. Nobody's stopping you. You're paying for my nose. Send me a bill. Get to the back of the fucking line like everyone else. Perdition is gonna fail. And you're a shitty screenwriter. Excuse me? Yeah, you heard me. Ah! Stay down, Bob. What're you doing? Get outta here! We ain't fuckin' actors, okay? This ain't playtime. This is real. When you say "real," you mean? Real means real. Do you speak English, you stupid bitch? The fuck are you guys saying? What the fuck are you even doing here? Goddamnit, get outta here! Hello? Hey, um, it's me. I know it's you. What do you want? Um... is Taylor there? He's doing homework. Look, I just wanted to, you know, say hi. Tell him I love him. We're kinda busy over here, we don't have all the free time you do. I'll tell him you called, okay? Look, Rene, um, I need to talk to Taylor, okay? Just have a heart here, okay? It's been like, a month. It's not a good time. Well, when... When is a good time? You're two months behind on child support. Two months! Look, I know. Okay, but I... I miss him. I know, I know, Taylor needs food Bob. Taylor needs clothes. Taylor needs health insurance. He's falling behind on his reading, and now I have to pay for a tutor. Do you have money for that? No. No, of course not. You never have money. You can talk to Taylor when you pay what you owe. Look, I'm his father, Rene. Then act like it! Anything else? Yeah. Go fuck yourself! Nice. So nice. Scumbag. Rene, no, Rene, just let me speak to-- Move fucker! The next game is called, "Run." I don't wanna play. It's freezing! I don't wanna play! I didn't fucking ask you, pansy! Are you scared? It's not loaded. Think again. Ain't no use in crying, little baby! It ain't gonna do you no good! Shit! Nell pick up. Go. Is everything okay over there? She's got a gun! 10-9, I didn't get that. I said we're having fun! 10-4. Turn that shit off. As I was saying, the next game is called, "Run." The object of the game is to not fucking get caught. If you get caught, you lose. I'd suggest not getting caught. Now run. Run, little piggies! Run! Let's go huntin', sis. They're gonna fucking kill us. Quiet! Did you hear that? Gotcha, baby! - Bum a smoke, man? - Yeah. Cathy picking you up? Yeah, she'll be here in a few minutes. Think we ever go too far? What's too far? Fucking people up forever. No. We haven't gone that far. Not yet. It's too much white noise now. That's why we have to keep going harder and harder. Otherwise, we're just gonna be forgotten and... I don't know. Like we never existed. I was first. They all stole it from me. These... these damn movie studios fuckin' franchises, these East Coast hipster perverts. These fuckin' horror directors, and they got nothin' better to do. You got to remember why you started this. Not to be the best. Not for the money. You did it because there's not a night that goes by that you don't wake up in a cold sweat. You're fuckin' scarin' me. - You're in the right place. - John! You smokin' again? - God no! Swear to God, no! Get your ass in here. Gotta go, man. Stop! Turn around. Guess what? You won! Yup. So that means you get to keep your life. And this little turd over here gets to fuckin' die! Allison, don't let them kill me! They're not gonna kill you. Because this is fake. Yeah. You're right. We're not gonna kill him. Because... you are. Point the fucking gun at his head. No. What? You think this fuckin' boy is any different from all the other men that have used and abused you? Oh c'mon, Allison. This little fucker's gonna go off to college, and the first party he comes to, he's gonna find some drunk, unsuspecting girl, he's gonna get her alone, he's gonna fucking rip her panties off, stick her face in the couch cushion, and fucking rape her. I'd never do that, Allison, I swear to God, I swear! Liar. He's a fucking liar! You gonna let that happen, Allison? She's gonna have to live with that for the rest of her goddamn life and you're gonna let that happen?! Are you gonna fucking do something about him and kill him right now? Do it. Do it, Allison. Do it! Allison, I can blow your brains out a fucking killer... Do it! The fuck? Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck! - Oh no! I gave them the wrong-- I gave her the right gun! He's dead! I gave her the right gun! I gave her the wrong fucking gun, what the fuck?! This is a fucking fake gun! He's not supposed to be dead! I didn't fucking do this! - I gave her the gun! - Somebody help! Help! Please! Help me! - Hurry the fuck up! - Please! - Come on, come on! Get her! Get her! Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck happened! Did you do the dishes, sweetie? Yes, Daddy. Something you wanna tell me? No, Daddy. 'Cause I, uh, found a bowl that was missing from the... cupboard. And, uh, the funny thing is, I found it in the trash can. It was all shattered, and, uh, some blood next to the trash can. I dropped it from the sink. It broke. Did you cut yourself? - Where's the body? - It's still there. You left the body in the woods? What, I don't know what the fuck to do with it!? What if somebody-- You want me to fucking go get it? Fine. Fuck, I'll go get it! Bring the body here, and I'll figure out what to do. The straps are for your own safety. So you don't hurt yourself. Where's Zachary? Allison, that was an accident. No, we need to call the police. - No, just... No police. We kil- we killed him. Yeah, and you pulled the trigger, okay? So just... no... police. It's m-murder. - Don't say that. Don't ever say that again. It was an accident. There's no one to blame. No one needs to find out. - No. No. We killed him! Allison. I'm not going to go to jail. I'm not gonna lose what little I have left. Not for him. And not for you, okay? And I will bury you both. Before I let it happen. Don't... test me. Now, what are we gonna do? You know, maybe I know someone who can change your perspective on things. Help! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Are you ready? Somebody! Then go. It's your time. Help me! Help me, please! Please, we need to call the police! Please! I don't know what you want from me! Please let me go! No! No! No! Wha-Get awa- No! No! Don't be scared. Don't be scared. I'm sorry I had to wear the mask. They made me. - No! It was the only way I could come and see you. I know I did bad to you. No! - I wasn't right in the head then. After Mom died, it was the booze, it was never me! Never me. And I did my time. And you know I paid for what I did to you. Fuck you! You didn't pay for shit! I can't let you run away again. No! We can go back to the way it was. Remember? You remember? Remember how good I used to make you feel? I remember. I think about it every day. And every night. No. No! This is for every time you ever tortured and degraded me. You evil fucking piece of shit! Damn fake blood got in my eye when that squib went off, stings like hell. What the fuck? Allison. Liar. Look. Don't do anything you're gonna regret, okay? Yeah? I'm in on it, alright? I've been in on it from the start, I'm part of the crew, okay? But this is, this is all just part show. Part of the experience. Like bringing my father here, part of the fucking show? I don't know anything about your father, alright Allison? Okay? You're a liar. I fucking trusted you! Listen. Okay. You need help, Allison. Alright, so, why don't we put the bat down? We both call 911 together? Please. Allison, stop, this isn't real! I'm sorry! Allison. I'm sorry! Fuck you! That... felt good. Allison, you, uh... y-you did it. You-You survived Perdition. Look, um, I'm proud of you, but, uh, now it's just, now it's time to just- put down the bat, and- and go home, okay? It's over. Now Allison, Allison just- just put it down okay. No, no, no! Wa-Wa-Wait! Oh my god... Allison, look just... just stop before you do anymore harm, okay? You're having a mental breakdown. No, Bob. I'm having a breakthrough. Oh God! Daddy? Taylor. Mommy didn't want me to call, but she's in the shower, so I took her phone. I just wanted to tell you that I miss you and that I love you a lot. I love you, too Listen. I'm always gonna love you. I'm sorry for everything. Why are you crying, Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? That pretty little map on the bottom of your mask? I knew what that was before you said a word. Do you know what's at the bottom of hell? Charlatans. And con artists. That's all you'll ever be. Oh God! Go. It's just us now. Don't worry. It will all be over soon. Shhh. Goodbye, Daddy. It happened again. I know. I don't like it. It feels wrong. It feels ugly. I'm gonna get you out of here. I'm gonna get us both out of here. Okay, mom. Don't call me that. I'm your sister, okay? Okay. This is my exit video. Tonight was important for me. Filled with fear. Vengeance. Acceptance. Death. Rebirth. It was... It was truly beautiful. I survived Perdition - I'm flipping starving! - I swear to God, if I open this thing and there's dog feces in it, I'm gonna fart in your mouth. Who the hell is that? Turn off your lights, asshole!
