Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Ezra, come and sit down, nothing is going to happen on a night like this. - Oh, drink up man. - No. It's what he wants, can you not see that? - But the storm... - Damn the storm. Come on Micah, come on have a drink with us. Micah... Look. Fetch our hats. Tell the others to wait, quick man. Come on. You believe me now Micah Smith? Now you've seen with your own eyes... you believe me when I tell you that's the home of Satan himself? - Aye, aye. - Then come. Somebody get hay, make sure it's dry. And bring some oil, come on, let's go. - Kill the warlock. - Open the door, open the door. Curwen. Curwen... - Well? - Where is she? You know who, the Fitch girl. - You deny she's here? - Certainly not, she visits us frequently. Don't you Miss Fitch? Don't you? Yes. - Of your own free will? - Yes. - There now Mr. Weeden... - Just a moment. What's your name girl? - Really, this is outrageous. - Quiet. Your name child. You see? He's taken her mind, her soul, the good Lord knows what else, just like the others. Now what do we do about it? Let him go on with his black magic or send him back to the hell he came from? - Send him back. - Then let's be about it. - No, not the woman. - Leave her be, she's been hexed. It'll be right with us again when he's gone Hester, you'll see. - Send him back to Hades. - Burn him. - Send him back where he comes from. - Burn him, burn him. Have you anything to say warlock? Only this... As surely as the village of Arkham has risen up against me... so shall I rise from the dead... against the village of Arkham. Each one of you... Ezra Weeden, Micah Smith... Benjamin West, Priam Willet, Gideon Leach... all of you and your children and your children's children shall have just... cause to regret the actions of this night. For from this night onward you shall bear my curse. Burn the devil, burn him. And travelers now, within that valley... through the red-litten windows see vast forms, that move fantastically... to a discordant melody. Whoo horse. There you are ma'am, carefully. Thank you Mr. Carmody, it was a most enjoyable trip. - Aye. - Thank you. It isn't often I get passengers for Arkham. Begging you pardon sir, did you say you were going to be staying here long? Oh, why do you ask? Arkham is an evil place, the village is cursed. Oh Mr. Carmody, don't tell us you're superstitious. Not at all and I'm not a coward either. But you couldn't pay me to spend a night in this place. - Why not Mr. Carmody? Ghosts? Spirits? - Spirits perhaps. I'm sorry sir, but we don't happen to believe in the supernatural. And I don't think you do either, goodbye. - Goodbye sir. - Goodbye. And good luck. Well, it looks cursed, I'll give it that. - Where the people? - Can't imagine. Look, the Burning Man, isn't that quaint?' - Yes, very quaint. - Well, it is. Now, where else would you find a tavern with a name like that? We were trying to find a... certain house here in town and we thought perhaps you could help us. - Whose house is it? - Ours. - I know that sounds silly... - It belong to the Curwen family. We inherited it. - Curwen you say? - Yes, that's right. I don't know of any such house. All right, thank you anyway. Just a minute. Why you want to know about the Curwen place? Because it belongs to us. - Your name is Curwen? - No, our name is Ward. Then? Joseph Curwen was my great-great-grandfather. - Can you tell us where the house is? - I can, but I won't. It's what I like about you New Englanders you're so friendly. - Come Ann, we'll find it ourselves... - Mr. Ward... Don't go there. It isn't a house, it's a madman's palace as old as sin. - Palace? In America? - Brought over stone by stone. Brought over from where? Europe somewhere, no one knows, no one wants to know. But if you value your lives, don't go there. Why not? What Edgar, Mr. Weeden means is that place is a ruin. It hasn't been occupied in over 100 years. Is that what you mean Mr. Weeden? - What a strange man. - Yes. He has had a bit, but what he says is right. Mr. Ward Mrs. Ward, please... do yourself a kindness. Go back to wherever you came from and forget you ever heard about Arkham. And what do you recommend I do with the deed, just tear it up? Yes. Just tear up the deed to a palace I've inherited and forget all about... without so much as laying eyes on the property. - Is that your advice? - It's more than advice Mr. Ward. - Come on Ann. - Mr. Ward... Take the road out of town about a quarter of a mile. At the post road turn left past the cemetery. You shouldn't have too much difficulty finding it. Here, I'll show you. There's the Curwen palace, over there on the cliff. We certainly want to thank you for being so nice mister... Willet, I'm a doctor. My office is down the street in case you need me. I don't think we'll be staying very long doctor. - Oh, you've decided that already? - It seems to have been decided for us. Thank you anyway, come Ann. - What do you think? - It's him, right enough, the devil himself. - Nonsense. - And you helped him. - As I'd help any stranger. - He's no stranger doctor and you know it. I don't know anything of the kind and neither do you. Are you blind or do you tell me you've never seen that face before? I'll admit there's a strong resemblance. But that's a matter of heredity, not magic. Call it what you will, one thing is certain... Joseph Curwen has come back to Arkham. - Why did you say that? - What? That we wouldn't be staying long. Why, do you want to stay in a town full of fools like that? - I don't think Dr. Willet was a fool. - All right, so Dr. Willet wasn't a fool. - The poor thing. - Yes. Well, let's get this over with. Charles, it's you. It's absolutely fantastic. Dear, something wrong? No. No. Let's see what the rest of this mausoleum looks like. Kitchen is over there. Wait. That doesn't lead anywhere, this way. - How would you know that? - Oh, just a guess. I'll let some light in here. Good evening. - Who are you? - My name is Simon. - What are you doing here? - I'm the caretaker. I was preparing your room. In the dark? One becomes accustomed to the darkness here. I'm sorry Mrs. Ward if I startled you... but I didn't know you'd be here so soon. Just a minute. How is it you expected us at all? Why, your attorney Mr. Hutchinson, contacted me. Since then, I've been preparing the palace for your arrival. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go fetch your bags. No, no, that won't be necessary, we're not staying. But where would you spend the night? After all Mr. Ward, this is your home. Get the bags. Very well. Dinner will be served at 8, if that's convenient. Thank you. Charles, you don't really want to spend the night here? No, of course not but... But the old fellow was right. We have to spend the night someplace, don't we? Quiet, quiet I say. Is it food you want? - What's wrong with him tonight? - Not him woman, it, it. How many times must I tell you? It knows, that's what's wrong. It knows who's come back to Arkham. Charles, I'm all packed. Charles, you ready? - I have decided to stay. - What? Just long enough to fix the place up, with a little work, it could bring a good price. Don't you think? I should imagine, I don't know. I estimate two weeks, perhaps three to get things started anyway. - You mind Ann? - No, not exactly. - Can't say it pleases me. - Then you go home. Charles? I'm sorry. It's just that I... I can't leave now until I... find out some things. Nightmarish yes, but not a nightmare. They're quite real I'm sorry to say. - But what are they doctor? - Human beings. Very unfortunate human beings. They were born mutated. You see Mrs. Ward, it requires an extraordinary combination of elements... to form a normal person. In their case, the combination was wrong. They were gathered by Weeden, of course, for the purpose of frightening you away. But why doctor? Why should we be treated as though we have the plague? Because you do, to these people at any rate. Understand Mr. Ward, Arkham is a strange community. You see it's haunted, but not by ghosts but haunted nonetheless. By fear, by guilt... and by the memory of a particular night. Particular night? But what is this to do with us? Well, you see... 150 years ago a man named Joseph Curwen moved to this village and built this palace. His first wife died in childbirth... so he selected the most beautiful woman in the village and took her for his mistress. Unfortunately, she was engaged to marry an Arkhamite named Ezra Weeden. No, no thank you. You spoke with his descendent yesterday. - Oh, the man at the inn. - Yes. Well, according to legend... a number of strange things occurred when Curwen moved into the village. - Terrible noises were heard in the night. - Thank you. Young girls were said to have disappeared from their homes to be gone until dawn... and then reappear with no memory of their whereabouts. Weeden wasted no time in placing the blame directly on this doorstep. He and his coterie of friends claimed that Curwen was a warlock. - Warlock? - Yes, one who conjures up the dead. They demanded punishment. And one night the people of the village marched on the palace... dragged your ancestor into the yard and burned him. Burned him? The 'Burning Man.' That without doubt explains the guilt, what about the fear? Curwen put a curse on the village, he vowed that he'd return. You can see the resemblance yourself. Dr. Willet, I'm sure that every warlock or witch who died in America left a curse. Why should Curwen's be taken so seriously? Why should it be remembered after all these years? I can't say, he was a strange man. - There were terrible rumors about him. - Such as? It was thought Mr. Ward, that he'd gained possession of a book called the Necronomicon. Have you heard of it? No. Well, it obviously never existed except in the minds of the superstitious. But they claimed it held enough secrets to give a man absolute power. Of course, every mythology has such a book... but the Necronomicon supposedly contained formulas... through which one could communicate with or even summon the elder gods... the dark ones from beyond who had once ruled the world... and now are merely waiting for an opportunity to regain that control. Cthulhu, Yog-sothoth. Dreadful rubbish, I know. Still, the people of Arkham believed it. They claimed that Joseph Curwen and two other warlocks... were trying to open the gates to these dark gods. Open the gates? How? They claimed that Joseph Curwen... was trying to mate those beings with humans to create a new race... through which the gods could regain their control. That's how they explained the mutated births... unsuccessful experiments passed on from generation to generation... carried in the blood. - What's your explanation doctor? - I don't have one. I advise you Mr. Ward to leave this village. I advise you to flee it as you would from a madman with a knife... who feels compelled to destroy you before you can destroy him. It's a cold night sir, you'll need your coat. Thank you. You seem troubled sir, is something wrong? - You didn't hear them? - Beg your pardon? - The voices? People? - No sir. - Must've been the wind. - Perhaps you should ask Mr. Curwen. - Curwen? - Yes. Maybe he could tell you. - Welcome Joseph. - Simon, how long? - 110 years. - 110 years? And whose body is this I'm now occupying? His name is Charles Dexter Ward. My great-great-grandson, perfect. All the others were useless, you would not accept them. - No matter, where's Jabez? - Here Joseph. Jabez, my old friend. We three... together again. But briefly, I fear. I think I shan't be able to hold him much longer. He fights me. When will you have full control? Soon Simon, soon. Keep him here for a while longer and he will be all mine. He has my blood, I can feel it. The book. The book. Good. Good. Now leave me my friends, he fights me.. He fights to leave me. What is it Charles? What's the matter? Dear, what are you doing down here? I don't know Ann. I must've walked in my sleep. - Please dear, let's leave here now, tonight. - I want to Ann... - but I can't. - Why not? Charles, why not? Over a whole week he's been there, what's he been doing? That's what I want to know, what's he been doing? Getting ready, that's what. And meanwhile, we sit here like sheep. - Willet, I thought you said he'd be gone. - I thought he would be... but you made him feel so welcome he's probably decided to stay for good. Go on sneer, you can afford to. You have no half witted thing locked in your attic and no woman to worry about either. Weeden, I got this whole town to worry about. The man you fear is dead. Can't you fools get that through your heads? He died over 100 years ago. He can't harm you or your women. Don't you forget doctor, that the man who died over 100 years ago... he did this. And now, he's back with us again. - He'll be doing more. - Unless we stop him. - Charles, where have you been? - Out walking. - At this time of night? - Yes, at this time of night. Must I report my movements to you like a schoolboy? - No, of course not. - Mind your own business. - Charles, what's happened to you? - Nothing whatsoever. No, you've changed, I've never seen you like this. Charles, if you won't go back to Boston at least let me call Dr. Willet. No. I shall be calling on Dr. Willet personally within the week. Well now, are you satisfied? - Yes. - Then go back to bed. - What will you be doing? - That is not your concern, good night. Good night. Charles Dexter Ward... - Leave me alone, leave me alone. - I will never leave you alone. Your blood is my blood, your mind is my mind, your body, my body. It will do you no good to resist me, your efforts grow weaker every day. No. No. You cannot keep me out of you, my will is too strong. Too strong for you too strong for you. - Why are you spying on me? - I, I heard voices. Tomorrow you must leave. Now, is that understood? - Yes. - Now go to your bed. - You lost him? - For a time. He has a strong will, stronger than we thought. But you did well, he has the Curwen strain. Hester. Charles, where are you? Is that you? Mrs. Ward? I heard sounds, thought we had prowlers. - It was his wife. - Where is she now? - In her room. - Did you lock it? Yes. Stupid woman, she doesn't know what it is to love. Joseph it's, it's been too long. No, we will continue trying. Yes Joseph, as you say, we'll continue trying. Now, help me upstairs quick. - Oh, yes. - Quickly, quickly.. - I've been so afraid. - No Ann. - Yes. - What is it? What's happened? Tell me. I don't know. It's this house. I think I must be going out of my mind. Where have I been tonight? - Don't you remember? - No. I'm so confused. I'm so confused. Ann, we got to get out of here before it's too late. - Yes dear. - Tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow morning? - Yes, we will. - Mr. Ward, leaving so soon? - That's right. Any objections? - Why, certainly not sir, but... - Well... well, you see, I can make no plans until I know what you want to do with the palace. - We're selling it. - Oh, I see. But sir, could you issue a check for the week's expenses? - All right, how much? - I'll get the receipts. No, that won't be necessary. How much? We're in a hurry. It'll only take a moment sir. You go out to the coach, I'll join you in a minute. Mrs. Ward. Doctor, you almost missed us, we just leaving. Very wise decision, particularly under the circumstances. What do you mean? Something happen? I'm afraid so. In fact, I was on my way to warn you. But it doesn't matter now. Doctor please, I'd like to know. There was a rather ugly occurrence last night. - In Arkham? - In the cemetery. A grave was dug up and a body stolen. Nobody knows who did it... but the people, as you might well imagine, are blaming it on your husband. Why? The grave that was opened was that of Hester Tillinghast. Joseph Curwen's mistress. And did they think Charles... What's wrong with those people? They're stupid to the marrow of their bones. You know who robbed that grave, don't you doctor? - No. - They did. - They? - Weeden and his dirty little friends. - Why would they do that? - Why? Isn't it obvious? To frighten me, to drive me away from my home. It's a possibility. But you don't think I did it, do you doctor? No, but it's a good thing you're leaving all the same. - But I'm not leaving. - Charles, you promised. You can go back to that village doctor. You can go back and tell those people that Charles Dexter Ward has decided to stay. How long has he been like this? It started the first night... just for a little while, and then he was himself again. - But it kept happening. - What kept happening? This change. I'm so afraid, I've never seen him like this. Mrs. Ward, I want you to tell me exactly what is happened since your arrival in Arkham. - I have him now. - Are you sure? Charles Dexter Ward is dead. - Then we can begin our work. - Not quite yet. There a few little things I must do first. - Oh, Joseph, can't you forget what happened? - Forget? Forget that my flesh was burned from my bones while I was yet alive? No. No, this village will pay for its crime, just as I vowed. - But the work. - The work? There can be no work without my knowledge. We've waited 110 years, we can wait a bit longer. I'm not an alienist Mrs. Ward, but there can be little doubt as to what's happening. Your husband is reacting to the legend of his ancestor. The attitude of the village... the remarkable resemblance between him and the figure in the portrait... the atmosphere of the castle, are all working together to cause this aberration. Then I've got to find a way to help him. - You're not going back in there? - Yes, what else can I do? Leave him? I would advise it. - But then of course, you can't. - No. Promise me one thing Mrs. Ward... that you'll contact me if things get out of hand. Yes, I will doctor. Thank you. Why you returned? - Because you need me. - Perhaps you're right. Come here where I can see you. - You love me? - Yes. Then kiss me. Why do you hesitate? Surely a husband has certain rights, I demand that you kiss me. Oh, Oh, what delights we'll share, we two. What tender, intimate delights. - Maybe it was a leprechaun. - It's nothing to laugh at Bruno. I say, who but the devil would do such a thing? Well, he couldn't have lifted it alone. Sure not, but remember the two that worked with him. - They was never caught. - Aye. Or maybe it was Dr. Willet gave them a hand. No, Willet is a fool all right but he's one of us. Remember it was his great-great-grandfather who helped with the burning. And yours that held the torch. And it was yours that did the burning. And don't be forgetting that. Forget it? I'm proud of it. In fact, I've been thinking along the same lines myself. I'll be no part of murdering. Who said murdering? Me? Did I say murdering? What are you talking about? Self protection, that's what I'm talking about. A man threatens your life and you have the means to stop him, what do you do? - He's done no threatening. - Not yet, but he will. First this unholy business at the cemetery. Next, our women will start wandering out late at night eyes all glassy... bellies filled with God knows what, ten you'll see. I say this to you, all of you. If we do nothing but sit around and talk about it, then we deserve whatever we get. Now, good night to you. Get away, get away, you damned thing, get away. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord, In this veil of tears... We suffer much and sin mightily. Yet we take solace in the promise of thy eternal forgiveness. - Amen. - Amen. Joseph, have you not gorged yourself enough on revenge? You not know the extent of my appetite type. I'll not have my fill of revenge until this village is a graveyard. Until they've felt as I did... the kiss of fire on their soft, bare flesh, all of them.. Have patience my friends. Surely after all these years I'm entitled to a few, small amusements. What do you want? What do I want? Merely to exercise my husbandly prerogative. Is there anything so strange about that? - Charles please... - Please? Please what my dear? Oh, I know. You're upset because I've neglected you, that's it, isn't it? Well, I've been very busy but I'm back now. - We have the whole night before us. - Stop it, no. Stop, don't.. No, no... You fool... You stupid, weak little fool. - Hester... - It is useless. No, I will try again. Oh doctor, thank God you come. - Why? What's happened? - I don't know, I... - I don't know, something terrible. - Well, where is he? I... Look Mrs. Ward, you must calm yourself. Then you must tell me everything, sparing no detail. Your life and your husband's may depend upon it. Yes doctor. Well, we were up in the bedroom a short time ago. And then, all of a sudden, he... Doctor, you got to help me get him out of here. This place is killing him. Joseph Curwen, he's killing him. Look at him. That filthy, horrible old man, I hate him. - I hate him, I hate him, I hate him... - Mrs. Ward. I'm sorry doctor. - Was a stupid thing to do. - Yes, it was. How are you doctor? - Excellent, thank you. - Glad to hear it. This is a pleasant surprise, what brings you here? - Nothing in particular. - Oh, just looking in, eh? That's right, you mind? Mind? No, on the contrary, I'm delighted and so is my wife. Aren't you my dear? Here, a little glass of wine will make you feel better. I don't want any. The doctor and I are going to have a little chat. So, you will just stay here and rest, eh? There you are, come doctor. She sent for you, of course. - No, as I was... - There's no need to lie doctor. In a way, I'm glad. I've been terribly upset about her. - This house has a strange effect on her. - How do you mean? Well, you saw how she acted a moment ago, that sort of thing. Fits of depression, anger, hallucinations. I hoped it would pass, but she gets worse every day. I see. I suppose she told you how... - how I've begun to change? - Yes. Part of the pattern. I scarcely recognize her anymore, doctor. - My own wife. - What do you want me to do? Take her back to Boston, get her out of this house. - Why don't you? - She wouldn't permit it. - She fears me, can't you understand? - Yes, I think I can. - Then you will help? - I shall try. Thank you, I appreciate it. But remember, discretion. She mustn't guess that you know the truth. Well my dear, I've a surprise for you. You won't have to stay in this place any longer. The good doctor is going to take care of you. Dr. Willet? Yes, it's all arranged, he will see you to Boston. - Isn't that right? - Yes. Doctor, you don't understand. - Come along Mrs. Ward. - No, I won't go. Please Mrs. Ward. All right. You needn't bother to pack my dear, I'll send your things along. Goodbye doctor, goodbye my dear. We'll be together again soon. I promise. - What of his woman? - We're rid of her. - Did you? - No, it was not necessary. I convinced the good Dr. Willet that she'd begun to lose her mind... to imagine strange things, even that her own husband had turned against her. - They'll lock her away. - But if Dr. Willet should return? He will learn that Charles Dexter Ward has retired to his New England estate. Well, do you know of any law prohibiting a man from residing on his own property? Now, let us begin again. Well, you can see what happened to poor Gideon. - What are we going to do about it? - Let's do something. - Let's get him. - What's happened? Don't you really know what happened Mrs. Curwen? My name is Ward. No, I don't know. - We came to see Gideon. - Then come and see. There's Gideon and each and every one of us unless we do something about it. Just a minute, you know how this happened? It didn't just happen doctor, it was caused to happen. By whom? You know who did it? - Aye and so do you. - Who? The man who swore to do it. The man you call Charles Dexter Ward. - My husband would never do such a thing. - She's lying, they're all in this. Mrs. Ward, you better come along with me. - Where we going? - Back to the palace. We got to get him away from there before these people... decide to take matters into their own hands. Doctor, I'm going with you. Don't be foolish. Wait here until I come back. - I'm going with you. - Then we must hurry. - Lucien, you got the ropes? - Here. - Elijah? - Aye. All right then, let's be about it. Mrs. Ward. - Did you find him? - No. - What about Simon? - Who? - The caretaker. - Oh, I didn't see anyone. I know Charles is here. Is there any more to the place than we've seen? - I don't know. - Wait a minute. When you tried to destroy the picture suddenly he was in the room. - Did you see him come in? - No. Neither did I. Ward, Charles Dexter Ward, are you down here? Don't. - It's only a book. - It's much more than a book. My God. - What did you see? - What a pleasant surprise. Now that you've seen all of the palace Dr. Willet, what do you think of it? It's quite old you know, older than you might imagine. Torquemada spent many a happy hour here a few centuries ago. - It was old then. - Mr. Ward... I'll admit the furnishings do leave something to be desired but... it has a lived-in quality, don't you think? After all, home is where the heart is. Isn't that so my dear? Ward, listen to me. I'd be happy to doctor, but my friends grow impatient. Oh, please forgive me, may I present Miss Hester Tillinghast... Mr. Simon Orne and Mr. Jabez Hutchinson, I believe you know they are my associates.. You see, we began a project... a few years ago but unfortunately it was... it was interrupted and we're most anxious to take it up again. What sort of a project? The most important ever attempted of humans Dr. Willet... more important than you can ever imagine and therefore I fear, beyond your understanding. As a matter of fact, we don't fully understand ourselves. We obey. That is all, we obey. Simon... Come. Come I said. - Hester, Jabez... - No, stop. Charles, Charles... Charles... What are you doing to her? Honoring her Dr. Willet, honoring her. - Joseph Curwen... - Maybe we'll just smoke him out. - Ann... - Charles... Poor Ann. - You traitor. - Dr. Willet, get her away from here. Get her away from here Dr. Willet, take her away, get her away from here. - Quickly, quickly. - What about Charles? I'll come back for him. They're finished. Are you all right? Yes, thanks to you and to my wife. I don't know how I can ever repay you for what you've done Dr. Willet... - but I intend to try. - Charles, are you sure you're all right? Perfectly sure my dear. Perfectly sure.
