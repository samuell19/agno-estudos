"It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity." Albert Einstein made that statement when the steam-powered locomotive was still a wonder of technology. I wonder what theory he would have had for the mess mankind has made of things now. Humankind did the best that it could most of the time, but complacency cost them. The first wave of the drone assault destroyed them. They never had a chance to regroup after that first devastating attack. They had no reference for its sheer force. Mmm, but we really lost the battle before the first shot was fired, didn't we, Tallis? Man does not live in peace. Check stop, Tallis. I'm detecting movement. 1 200 meters. Pulsing to microwave frequency. Rodent. Small size. Tallis, it's lunch. A disease-free canine. Good target of opportunity, Tallis. You could eat smoked dog for a week. You're throwing away our rations. My rations. This is technically unsound behavior, Tallis. A cranium kill at 1 200 meters? What an extraordinary waste of advanced nanotechnology. I wasn't engineered for scavenging. Check stop. Modular surveillance is reading a low-level distress beacon. What is it? Get ready for a walk. We're headed to the old refinery. There's a syntax error. It's pulsing an obsolete version of the modular code from the crane tower, broadcasting with a 700 hopper frequency. Tallis, it could be another operator. We are required to verify. Mmm, no entry, Tallis. This location is heavily booby-trapped. Composition four, amatol, and traces of tetrytol. Special purpose operator ordnance, Tallis. Not drone issue. You'll have to scale the outside of the building. By the damn dead demon of Socrates, who's out there? 700th Operator Tallis and Smart Scope Angel 1 1 020. Please identify yourself. This is Eye Cap Colonel Norton, 1 4507. What in the damnation's been happening? How long have you been here, Colonel? We blitzed into the Valley of Death under hellacious incoming fire. God-awful experience. I guess old Bradley here lasted about 20 minutes. Saw 'em-- drone police, dogs, gathering up other bodies. They must have missed us up here, damn their eyes. So much tracer, Pilgrim, it was biblical. An apocalypse in the devil's own den. Wave after wave ripped into them with the minigun. When that was cleaned off, we fired 30-mil rockets, grenades-- Wave upon wave, like fighting the tide, brother. The drones sprayed H.E. and phosphorous up here. That blotted the flesh out. I was useless after that. I watched helpless as Kurtigan took three weeks to die of his gut wound. It was pretty dark, brother. Any food? Ration packs? Check the ammo case in the corner. Careful. We rigged the mortar stock. It's on a tumbler. Electronic countermeasure circuit. There's a disabler below the claymore clacker unit. Guys, take me. You gotta take me! I'm goin' nuts up here! There's another 30 years on my cell! The minigun's AI system is unstable. It's logic processor has become contaminated. That said, it is a valuable piece of gear, Tallis. We should take it. Too heavy. Don't need it. I'm still in good order. Need a little TLC. I could still run a full maintenance check up to a few months ago. Oh, come on, guys. There's four cans of fresh linked ammo by the wall. I'm a son of a bitch in battle. The personification of pure hell in a firefight. You'll never regret it. The first rule of action is to survive by any means possible. Contact with the enemy should be avoided at all costs. God damn it. Book-quotin', Bible-bashin'-- Toss me into the eternal lake of fire if I lie. It's the damn loneliness that kills me. Switching to Doppler frequency. Microwave sensors engaged. Interlacing comprehensive ECMs. It is with a heavy heart that I address you tonight. Heavy because I am proud to tears to see you in all your glory. Heavy because of where I must send you. You are the vicious hounds of combat. My dogs of war... to be unleashed when all else has failed. And this eve... this day... that shall be forever etched in the history books has already seen great failure. Scammel's forces have been defeated in the Mojave. Brigadier Richards' ground troops have been crippled in Mexico. And the Navy and the Marines' finest are now fish food... all along the Pacific basin. Operators, you... you are the best there is-- the meanest and most ruthlessly efficient shock force in the world. You now have the opportunity to prove yourselves. Like no other time in our history, your country needs you. You have two ways to end this day: victory, by killing the drone police force, or death. You! You are the last of the last, gentlemen. Fight hard! And fight mean! And fight till the last round! Maintain your positions. ... prepare to evac. And then draw your blade and fight with that! I'll see you all in hell, you bastards of the 700th. Brick 5 is down. We are not in contact. All frequencies dead. Jesus, that's some heavy fuckin' ordnance. Estimate we're off target by three clicks. They dropped us right in the middle of a drone skirmish line. Coordinates check positive. Chopper pilots must have got spooked. The drone skirmish line now extends beyond the DMZ. There is no Green Zone. Where the hell's the rest of Brick 4? We're all that's left. Get on the radio! -Get that minigun up here! -Coming in! We gotta make for the structures. -This ORP won't hold! -Agreed, Tallis. Fire mission to the street! Then east to the black combat building. Go! Go! Go! Go! They've zeroed in on us! We need a diversion! One man moving fast... Make a lot of noise, we'll draw their fire and give you the opening you need! By drawing their fire, you'll be cut to shreds! Make a lot of noise, soldier! Good luck. No such thing as luck, Chief. Fall out! Let's go! Move it! Move! We should still attempt access into the black combat building through the eastern port. East is out. The City of Thebes Refinery presents an excellent target of opportunity. We'll head straight for the refinery. No guarantee it's not compromised. You lead, brother. Our current position has been laser designated. I advise leaving immediately. I'm registering movement all around our position, and none of it friendly. Still trying to breach the satellite frequency. They appear to have shut us out, Tallis. Shit, intercom and radio are both dead. No intelligence, runnin' microwave and Doppler. Frequency hopping. Seeking burst transmissions on a satellite band. I got static. Operator 1 1 020, copy. Brick 5 team leader, Clausewitz legend, over. It's getting awful quiet over there. 1 4 minutes and 38 seconds, that's all it took the E-700 to silence the big, bad drone police. Can you believe that? Go E-700! Try the ECM booster. I'm down to three clips and four grenades. You? Shit, two magazines, no grenades. Good thing we won this war. We'd be in trouble. Yeah, because of that green victory flag. E-700 never lost a fight it got into. Should have been all over the com-sat by now. Must have missed it. Tallis, we got company. Surrounded and outnumbered. Attack? Attack. Incubating Sergeant Anchilles' Eye Cap black box for future data retrieval. Sergeant Anchilles was incorrect, Tallis. E-700th didn't win in 1 4 minutes. What do you mean? I successfully breached the secure signal. I'm also checking through my advanced ECM scanner. The drones have complete and total control of our intelligence system. The 700th has lost this war, Tallis. We're on our own from here. Sergeant Anchilles 1 1 036. His name will be added to the list of the fallen. Warning. Hazardous situation approaching. High danger potential. This could be the war catching up with us, Tallis. I recommend immediate intervention. -Come on! -Go! Drive faster! Shoot the truck! A perfect pinwheel ambush. One can only admire the clarity of purpose of a soldier with no emotions, no feelings, no fear. Those are human beings down there. Engaging comprehensive ECM. All clear, Tallis. Doppler and microwave scanners show the drones have left us alone. There are no survivors here. Looks like someone disagrees with you. The concrete must have masked her body temperature. Are you going to stare at her all day, or attempt to administer medical attention? How's she doing internally? I wasn't designed for it, but... my modular scanner shows her bone structure's intact. Her temperature seems a stable 98. The type-B blood and brain matter on her face are not hers. What are you doing? It's a Hyrex patch. Shrimp protein to stop the bleeding. It'll help you mend. She seems pathologically aggressive. She's prepared to fight. Her equipment is low-tech-- pro-am surplus-- but it displays methodology. That means there's an organization somewhere. There may be a resistance movement after all. You're not getting any younger, Tallis. It might be time to find our cause. I'm here today to tell you about the eastern drone army and what it means to you. The USA as we know it. The blue areas represent overpopulation, crime, and unemployment. The red areas are safe, God-fearing, low-crime communities. Now watch on this graph as the computer-enhanced demographics show what has happened over the last 20 years. America's in crisis. Our laws, our politicians, are not working. Our once great country is on the brink of self-destruction. This is bad, unthinkable. I know you agree. This is the eastern drone soldier. He's the backbone of the drone police army-- their nightstick, their scales of justice-- a politician and policeman. He is good. He's your friend. And he's here to help. Thanks, Laura. Hi, Folks. My name's Fryar Dooley. I'm usually on the evening news. -But today... -Drone police propaganda. You really think the key to their defeat is in watching those old news broadcasts? Every day, we get older, slower, while they get smarter. The drones need humans. They've never been self-sufficient. Where am I? About 300 yards from where your vehicle crashed. You dressed my wounds. You'll live. I've got combat rations, if you're hungry. You'd share? Who are you? Speak now. There's 500k of uncut Hemex in that pistol grip. Trigger mechanism inoperable. You are not the authorized user of this weapon. He's offering to share his food with you. Did your rifle just talk to me? Tallis was hardwired to kill, not to nurse. So choose your next move carefully. Do you want any of this? You're one of the E-700, the special brigade shock troops. We heard you all bought it. That's what happened. Tallis has become something of a virtuoso in survival. I'm with a paramilitary cell based out in the desert. We were on a reconnoiter in town. Got busted by a drone scout patrol. How'd the others do? No. They all died fighting. You're like them. You're genetically engineered, right? Not like them. Tallis is electronically enhanced, not a cyborg. He has a nanotransmitter relay device in his eye. Otherwise, he's human like you. The drones are biomechanical replicants. If you ever see one without its mask, you'll understand. I've read about you guys. You run off a data disc or something. Hell, did I ever get you wrong. I am a Violex Systems advanced intellect superscope, representing the top of the line in battlefield nanocomputers. I'm approximately four times as advanced as the regular police drone, and as close to artificial intelligence as you're ever likely to encounter. I receive my directives from Tallis' Eye Cap. If he dies, I serve no purpose. So consequently, I also die. What's happening out there? Most people are too shocked to do anything. Others took to Iiving underground... like rats. Some of us chose to fight. To make a stand. Who's running the drones? They run off their first initiative... to kill human beings. Every month we make a sortie trying to find the new nerve center. If we can find it, destroy it, then theoretically we can disable them. Any luck? Based on intercepted radio transmissions, the drones are being run out of the City of Thebes Refinery. The City of Thebes was the target of our final great assault. Our last stand. It's their vulnerable underbelly. They know that, you know? So they're like a guard dog protecting their dead master. If I can get into the nerve center and steal the memory decoder, and get it back to my cell-- You need rest. I need a wash. We have a rain tank. lt's cold but clean. It'll do. She's correct. Your DNA is closer to drone than human. Like the drone, we must respond to our primary objective. That's what drives us beyond personal survival. We live for the need to fight. To kill the enemy. To stop it at all costs. This, Tallis, is our credo. Without further orders, our prerogative is to maintain cover. Let's join her, Tallis. Let's get back in the war. As character defines destiny, this is your destiny. What are you thinking, Tallis? Machine parts and servo drive retro-checking. I need a grease application. We're low on T.A.P. rounds, and only 8 depleted AA rounds left. Logic prevents me from advocating contact with the enemy in such a state, Tallis. But in truth, we have no choice. There's no such thing as luck. lt's talent meeting opportunity. He who trains...wins. Slash! Stab! Slash, slash, recover! Slash! Stab! Slash, slash, recover! Attack, Tallis. Attack! EE-700 special operator. The EE stands for electronically enhanced. You are an engineered supersoldier. In addition to your regular studies, you will receive digital input on a daily basis. The encoded transmissions will be read and stored in your personal ICU disc. Your Eye Cap. The information on your Eye Cap is available to you. It is what makes you so very unique. It is to be respected and utilized as any other weapon in your arsenal. I'm joining you. Good. Charcoal and coated Kevlar. It'll disguise your body temperature. Police drone issue, I rewired it safe. You got a plan? We hit them with so much ordnance, they think it's a full assault. In the confusion, we slip in and out before they realize it's a diversion. Then you present me to your commanders for a debriefing and a report. You're not big on the whole personality thing, are you? You need to rest. I'll wake you when it's time to leave. My name is Tallis. I have no company commander, no orders. I'm the last of my squad alive. However, I continue to be a member of the E-700th. I found this book... by Charlotte Bronte. And I was reading late. I read it. I read them all. It's time to leave. There's not supposed to be this much activity, Tallis. You wanna go back? Our intelligence was wrong, but... this is the place. Keep going. Shut down core transmission. We don't wanna advertise. Satellite beacon going inactive. Canceling signal hopper. I'm very uncomfortable with this. We have been compromised, Tallis. Back the way we came! Go back to the wire. Run! I'll catch up. Thermobaric charge the light green pipe, Tallis. Liquid fuel blast will white out the drones ECMs for at least 10 minutes. Give us our exit. Let's go! Go! Move! Move! Pretty trick with the blade there, Tallis. Dying due to insufficient intelligence would be a failure. They're like fire ants. How did you survive this long? One theory would be a life of uneven odds and good fortune. Just lucky, I guess. EE-700 doesn't believe in luck, just talent meeting opportunity. We're gonna see the sunrise again. Any day you see the sunrise... is a good day. Here's a plan: maybe we leave the girl behind next time, Tallis. I wanna learn. I wanna learn what you do. Now come at me. Power begins with balance. You must lower your center of gravity. You must find your dominant side. Train it to work with your body and mind, not against them. How? Both eyes open and point at the wall. Without moving, close either eye. The one that lines up is your dominant side. Very good. She's a slow learner, Tallis. She's trying. She could get you killed. Maybe. Lean into your shot when acquiring your target. Otherwise the force of the recoil will dictate where you shoot. You are volunteers. You have all volunteered to die for your country. So you've come to the best place in the world for dying. Consider yourselves dead already, and the fear will go away. Then you'll be able to kill the enemy. This is Sergeant Anchilles. He's going to tell you about your rifle. This is a Track 55, urban termination rifIe. From the moment you receive it, it is your best friend, your lover, your mother, all wrapped into one. If you lose it, you die. If you break it, you will die. If you get it rusty or dirty, you guessed it, you die. Our job here, and my life, depends on your living. So I'm going to teach you how to maintain your sidearm. We're in trouble, Tallis. Life forms approaching. They have small arms and I'm picking up crew-served weapon systems. Threat level, dangerous, Tallis. Tallis, what is it? Look. This don't look good. Get the men ready. How long can you hold this line, Corporal? Until I'm out of ammo and dead, sir. Hang in there. 3-6-1-4, demanding air support. Coordinates are alpha, alpha, tango 360 by 275, over! What the hell are you still doing here, Tallis? My position got smoked. What are you doing here, Washington? Eastern trench line, it's toast. They're all dead. Every one of them. So we withdrew. I suggest you two do the same. There's an extraction bird inbound at this time. 1 2 clicks out. How's that air support? D.C. postponed indefinitely. I'm with you, Washington. Let's go. I'm staying. You're staying? We got them into this. You're going to get me killed. You two have compromised your logic. We're out of here. Go! Get your people out of there, Sergeant, it's going to be a big one. Air support inbound! Get down! The vultures will feast. The thermobaric bombardment cooked them. It's a dead zone, Anchilles. Oh, well. It's better to go out with a bang than to fade away. Buddha said, "The path of all suffering was born of desire." She hates the drones. Never underestimate hate as a source of motivation. She'll do. I hope you're correct, Tallis. Because when you die, in effect, we both die. All of this will have been a terrible waste. Wear this. What is it? Binary explosive. RDX Hemex mix. It won't detonate on impact or fire, but you tap this striker three times, it'll flatten two city blocks. I don't believe in suicide. When you plan to lose, you lose. Sometimes it's unavoidable. Wear it. We get on the roof of this building. Cross roof to roof to the nerve center. You see me look right, you look left. Like FIBUA training. Detonate the place charges and deploy the grenades. Enter immediately. Make for your coordinates. Appropriate the drone data. In and out as quickly as possible. Keep moving. Don't get cornered. In exchange of fire, you'll always lose. Here. Pack these explosives at the base of the structure. Take out the building. Ready? Uh-huh. Detonate the charges. Here! I'm fine. I'm all right. Which way? Left at the end. In here. That's the room. Get what you need and get out quick. Okay. Move it. Come on. Keep moving! Get back! Okay, let's go. Come on. Go! Go! Move it! Move! Go! Go! Back up! Back up! Keep moving! Let's go! All right. Hold on! Come on! They're routing the auxiliary drone reinforcements. This position is hazardous, Tallis. We could always ask them to surrender! Do you trust me? Sure! Take out your suicide belt. My pleasure. Charge it! That's your plan? There's a two second delay on the third charge. We go out the window together! That's forty feet down to asphalt! The fall isn't going to kill us! Just do it! Fine! Hemex warhead. Proximity fuse. Better to go out with a bang. What is this stuff? It'll disguise your body temperature. Keep moving. All clear 360, Tallis. Another sunset and I can't move. No, I'm all right, it's a figure of speech. You're actually lucky that I'm here to look after you. I need a wash. Tallis. Tallis! What happened? He's lost too much blood. You have to administer medical attention. Oh, Tallis... We're quits. Quits? I fixed you up. I figure we're equal. You need more rest, Captain. Drone patrols will be looking for us. Okay, well, first you eat, get your strength back. Hey. What are these markings? Campaign profile. Each code denotes a date and location. It's my service record. Battle scars. I've been a soldier all my life. I've killed in 30 different countries, but... Then I have the advantage. Engaging forward-looking infrared. DCM activated. You disappeared. I like the view. You're a strange one, Tallis. I don't feel strange. I-- I need to get the discs back to the militia. I want you to come with me. Join us. I can do that. There was somebody at the drone nerve center. A human. It threw me. A small tactical unit would be able to get back inside. You said all the commanders are dead. That's the information our intelligence gave us. We're going to need to get a car. It's a four-day drive to the south. We don't have that time. I can find one. I wonder what they're going to think about you. They're soldiers, same as me. They don't make many soldiers Iike you, Tallis. You're the last of your kind. You're a dinosaur. Be ready to leave when I return. I should be going with you. Would I have made it in the E-700th? Unlikely. Do you know where you're going? There's a pick-up on 5th and Alvarado. I checked the battery. We can clean it up. Fix the electrical system. A drone satellite beacon will locate us as soon as you engage the ignition. We will move fast. Your logic has become impaired, Tallis. We can make this work. A productive and helpful member of modern society. I'm partnered with Patrol Delta since last Easter. He was the best partner a man could have. He took that bullet for me. No hesitation. Without thinking. What happened to finding a tactically sound solution? She's in a hurry. Are your feelings towards the deceased lessened because he's a cyborg clone, completely incapable of any intelligence whatsoever? Get the hell out of here. Go on, get out of here! Go on, you goddamn vultures! It's kind of sad, you know, in a sentimental way. I mean, my old man was a cop. His old man, too. I realize my sons have to find new professions. Don't get me wrong, now. I say it's sad for me to be the last fully human cop on active patrol. But I'll tell you what. With these guys out there, I'd be a lot sadder if I was a criminal. These guys, they might have had a chance with us, but they don't sleep. They use Doppler navigation, thermal imaging, radio-wave satellite communications, and I got to tell you, these guys never, ever miss. It's the theater, Tallis, they waited for you to leave. She sacrificed herself rather than go as a prisoner. Whatever I said about her, I take it back. But I don't understand why the drones waited for you to leave. The nature of the ambush displays a non-lateral decision process. Imagine what Da Vinci or Socrates might have achieved with your Eye Cap system. But you have it, and you must do what you do best. You must continue to fight. Voice off, Angel. Complying. Voice off. Another sunset and I can't move. You're actually lucky that I'm here to look after you. Another sunrise. Does this mean we're in business again, Tallis? Figured I'd see you two again. We're going to hear that familiar sound again. The anvil ring of combat. That is what you were trained for, Tallis. It's your birthright. It's what I was designed for. Ain't nothing on earth like the sound of an angry minigun, gentlemen. I am the tune that rips through your night. I am the incubus, the heathen, the partisan of the battlefield. Give me oil that I might inflict some pain. Oh, brother! Ha ha! Ship-shape fighting order. I'm a mean, lean, fighting machine. My chosen specialty is taking the lives of heathen drone police. I am the tune that rips through your night. I am the incubus, the heathen, the partisan of the battlefield. Give me oil that I might inflict some pain. Oh, brother. Covert frequency engaging. Ultra blue faces possible compromise. Deferring to ultra red. Interlacing Colonel Norton's AI com-sat into our system, Tallis. To quote Sergeant Anchilles, it's better to go out with a bang than to fade away. I've rigged this structure with RDX charges. They're set on ultra red frequency. Awaiting your next order, sir. When your position has been compromised, wait until the last possible moment before detonation. You'll be going with them, sir. Good luck, Colonel. Good luck, Colonel. The E-700th doesn't believe in luck. We were built to kill or be killed. It's time to do what we do best, Tallis. Ready, Colonel. Stealth launch anti-personnel rockets, incendiary level three, and good old H-E. High explosive barbeque time! "To imagine that it is possible to perform great military deeds without fighting is just empty dreams." Napoleon said that. Audio to stealth mode. How are we Iooking, Colonel? Engaging minigun. For St. Peter shall ride into town on a chrome dragon. And that dragon, his name is Puff the Magic Dragon. Damned be the wicked, the evil-doers, too. In your own time, Colonel. Open fire. I hope you have some cover there, Tallis. I just sent in the four horsemen of eternal damnation. The colonel shall punish you unholy sinners! Look what I got by the authority of God vested in me. St. Peter shall ride into town on a chrome dragon! May the lord have mercy on my wicked, wicked soul! This is it, Tallis. It's the drone relay station we've been looking for. You're Tallis, of the EE-700. I know all about you. You're built around the nanotechnology my company patented. Move away from that monitor or you will be shot! She can't do that. This is bigger than both of us. This is the development of artificial intelligence. The comprehension of justice. She's warning the drones, Tallis. Who are you? She ought not have died this way. Disable the drones. You don't understand. We don't command the drone. The drone commands us. We worship the drone! We engineered them to be perfect, infallible. They are human evolution. They are our religion. There are hundreds of us working for them, but they don't need us-- any of us-- anymore. See, they've evolved. Become truly self-governing. Without you... without this equipment... the patrolmen would stop? Our objective was the constitution of a peaceful world. A utopia. The realization of the mythical nirvana. They must have known the drone would eventually kill them too. The human mind is basically good, but so weak. Who are these guys? They aren't registering on my sensors. Must be a type-two model. All of that is classified. They were an advanced model combat drone operating on an ultra-low level frequency. That's covert military capability. I hope there are no more of them, Tallis. Status on drone police force? I wish you could see what I'm seeing, Tallis. Com-sat wide range. The drones are static, operative status inactive. Without directives, they're on ice, Tallis. That's for my family, you bum! That's it, kids. Kill them! They can't breathe without a command. Without the relay station, the drones are powerless. They're literally suffocating. You saved the world, Tallis. What's left of it. Don't celebrate yet. Someone using an ultra-low frequency is headed right for us. Drones. There's only eight of them registering. Bad news, they don't die easy, but they do die. Three in pursuit, trying to locate the others. Keep scanning, Angel. Scanning. Thermal. Doppler. lnfra red. Clear 360. Maintain a low body mass, Tallis. They're able to track us regardless of the environment and they are much stronger than the type one. Nothing. I'm showing nothing at all. They've overruled my ECM. I'm sorry, Tallis. Can't lock target. Cannot initiate counter fire. They've gone to cover. We need to take the offensive. We will not survive under these conditions. That's your last quick clot patch, Tallis. It will take more than shrimp protein to fix you if you lose this fight. They're one step ahead of me. I must be transmitting. The beacon in your Eye Cap transmits on a covert frequency. Tallis, they must have decoded it. They know everything. They used you to draw out the human resistance fighters. Please be careful. Hey! Looking for me? Don't ever do that again, Tallis. Have you pinpointed a reference yet? Atmosphere precipitation is affecting my thermal imagery. I got to use the door! Negative. Use side window. Don't touch a thing. This is obsolete ordnance. The accelerator has degenerated. Tallis, it is very unstable. Scan, Angel. Running ultra-low frequency check. The tetrytol concussion has damaged my surveillance system. Data indicates that we are alone. Please maintain extreme caution. You have killed what can't be killed. We were so close. Our great task almost complete. You have destroyed it all. Your great task was murder. You were wrong. Look upon my murdered family, soldier. Prepare to join them. If I live, the drone army lives. If I survive, we will rise again. I am hard-wired to rebuild. Programmed to regenerate. With minimal technology, I could replenish the EDP army. Join me, soldier. We can command an army the likes of which you can only imagine. We're similar, you and I. Not like them. Drop your weapon. Join me. I don't think so. We were so close, Tallis. Purgatory. The place or state within which the souls of sinners are subjected to purifying sufferings until, having paid their debt, only then are they worthy of paradise. I wouldn't call it paradise, but it is home. You're easy to find, Tallis. I just go where all the shooting is. What happened to your eye? I'll live. That would be another sunrise, Tallis. It's a beautiful day to start rebuilding.
