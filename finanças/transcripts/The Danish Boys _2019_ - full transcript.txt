have full confidence in chairman Stefan Schmidt. The situation he is in right now, as we speak, the rumors of his divorce are the most damaging, but so far he managed to shut them down and... Did you see him downstairs? Who the hell told him, that I'm here? Do you want ice? Cheers. I've missed you. Did you? Mmm. You smell nice. Did you tell her? Yes, she knows. Whet does she know? She... She knows what she needs to know. Alright and what's that? - She knows what she needs to know. - And what's that? It sounds like there's something in particular you want her yo know? - Yes. - And what's that? I would like her to know that you've found someone new. She knows what she needs to know Samir, okay? - Alright. - Yes. Just a second! Hello? Yes. It's me... Sure, I'm going to pick it up soon. What's that? - Touche my dick! - I'll pick it up. Can't you just put it in some plastic bags, and leave it in the basement? I'll pick it up. Leave it in the basement! Yes. No, not now! I can't do that right now. Please, stop! Fine, let me talk to her then. Hi darling, hi! Why are you not asleep? I promise that when you wake up tomorrow, it won't be raining anymore. Sleep tight. No, you hang up... You're a good liar. You think? Well, I have practiced a lot, I'm a politician, you know. It's difficult for her, she's only five. It's difficult for me too. Is it? Is it really that tough on you? Is it? No. Not right now. Right now, it's not that tough. Stop it. - You can't break free, can you? - Yes I can. No you can't. Then do it! It should be like this always. Just you and me. Yes. Why can't we just be together then? Always? Because I'm 48... And you are... I don't even know. I could be your father. You really couldn't. I told him everything yesterday. So now, I don't have anywhere to live. You told him what? Everything. Everything as in everything with me or what? No. Not "everything". Relax. All I said was that I'm very much in love with a... Samir, I'm almost 50 years old. I'm busy at work, we're about to win the election, I'm in the middle of a divorce. And you're young and everything will be alright. Trust me, once I was young too, and everything worked out for me just fine. Listen, we have to take one day at a time, right? What is it? It's clear you don't want to be with me. Ew... Last week you said we could move in together. I said "Let's find a place just for the two of us." Do you really think that means, that I want to move in together playing happy family or what? Yes. You know my political support base, right? If I suddenly move in together with... a guy like you, they'll go crazy. I already cut ties with my family, and I... But I never asked you to do that, let's remember that! You know what, fuck off. Fuck off... Are you leaving? Hey! Hello! Are you still down there? Hey, come up here! I have something very exciting to tell you! Yes, hello, is it Gossip Weekly? Yes, listen, we already had a chat about Stefan Schmidt getting divorced, and there's a good reason for that actually... Let go! That's it! You get that? Where is your mind at? What the hell are you thinking? Was it you who called him and told him to show up here? Is it? You are just too pathetic, really. Fuck you! How the hell would you make anyone believe, that I'm gay? I'm not! Everyone knows that I'm just a normal family man, who loves his daughter, right? Listen, You will get what we initially agreed upon, Samir, and then I never want to see your face again. Hi Oliver. It's Britt from the venereal clinic. We've got the results of your blood tests. call back so we can schedule an appointment. Hi Sis. What are you doing? You called?

Don't do that! What the fuck are you doing? Some of us have work, you know? I couldn't sleep. Aw, you couldn't sleep? Are you coming to my birthday? - Who's coming? - It doesn't matter who else is coming. Are you excited about being a year older? That's an odd question. Are you going to have babies soon? Am I going to have babies? - I'm going to turn my pussy into a slip-n-slide! - Cut it out! Would you take care of me if... I got ill? Hi! Sexy! If you're going to be late, please call ahead. Oliver, wait here and I'll be back in two seconds, okay? - Yes. - Good. Okay. We meet again. Listen. Your tests came back and they were both negative. Okay. Yes. There's nothing there. I don't understand. What don't you understand? Oliver... You know what? I'm not your mother. And it's not my job to parent you. But I want to help, if you're interested? - I want another. - Another what? I want to take another test. - The tests are fine. - Then do another. Just put a needle in my arm. It'll take two seconds. That's not necessary. Hi Oliver. You came? - What? - Nothing. It's just always interesting to see how people look in real life. You look good in clothes, too. Come in. When did you test positive? - Some months ago. - Okay. So it still takes some getting used to? It's fine. I think I can handle it. What? You're just... Quite young. I'm old enough, aren't I? Old enough for what? That depends on what use you have have in mind for me? Okay? That's not why why I invited you. Why, then? You're always online. I thought it'd be good for you to be a little social. And maybe in another way than you're used to. Hang on a second. Slowly. Slowly... You okay? Yeah. Actually... Can you take off the condom? There's really no reason to wear it, is there? What do you mean? It makes no difference, does it? That's not how this works. But... isn't it better without if? It's not coming off, and that's final. Okay. Forget what I said. Continue. - I don't think you understand. - It doesn't matter! Forget what I said. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Oliver. Oliver. Come back inside. Hey... There's no reason to run off. Come back inside. Oliver! Hello? Please... Please pick up. Oliver, you promised you'd come. Hey Sis. It's me... I've lost my keys, so... could you let me in? What do you say? Thanks. Is that for me? - What? - The poster. Yes. It's really nice. Thanks. You thought to make a website... and sell them. Is there something you want to talk about? No. What would that be? Don't you have to clean up? Why... why are you here? Are you ill? Oliver, are you ill? Move. Fuck you. It seems like a big show. Yeah. It's a pretty important competition. Are you coming? A YOUNG MAN'S DANCE Couple number 67... Couple number 16... 19 and 23. That was the Viennese Waltz. Wasn't your Dad supposed to be here? Hi. Are you okay? Yes, I'm just nervous.

The creeper's out. - Who? - That, what's his name... Oh, Aleksander? So, big plans this weekend? Is he really gay? Katrine told me. She knows someone who dates him. Fag-xander! I really don't get why anyone... Aleksander? FAG Why don't you just stay over? - I could cook something for you. - No, thanks. Nothing major or anything, I could probably get my mum to heat some leftovers or something. Aksel! I'm not hungry. Of course you aren't. Well, mum's on the paleo diet... But it might just be your thing. Paleo isn't my thing. I think it is... You pretty much fuck that way, caveman-like. I know this is... difficult for you. But you don't have to lie to your friends. I can't do it your way. You're not doing it in any way. You're just lying to them. So, you're just going to crawl out that window again? It's ridiculous how you still seem to think they are the ones judging you. Fuck, Henrik, weren't you a boyscout? Well, yeah. But in a big city... Firewood delivery. Not sure it's needed! I heard Simone broke up with Jasper? She cam asking about you, Aksel. Simone. She's getting all worked up for you, Aksel. Yeah, why don't you get in there, Aksel? You didn't hold back in grade school. What's up, you afraid of women, now ? Your willy's out of order? Was yours ever in use? What, you're a fag now? You're disgusting, Peter!
