[MUSIC PLAYING] RADIO ANNOUNCER: All right, all right, all right. Well, that's what the say in America anyway. It's going to be another lovely 1980s summer's day with a maximum, can you believe, of 78 degrees. That mean a hot one for sure. Now, on the subject of heat on London's capital radio, we got some news for you rock fans out there. And first of all, the big gonzo, that's right it's Ted himself. Ted Nugent is set for his first UK tour in three years. And that should be a wild one. The Police they're now set to headline the first major concert at the new Open Air Milton Keynes Bowl and it's fantastic on July the 26th, right? And if I tell you that UB40 are on that same bill, you know what a night it's going to be. Now the mighty Motorhead, they're headlining a big one day heavy metal show at Stafford Bingley Hall again on Saturday, July the 26th. Oh, yes and by the way fellas, just between you and I, if you're gonna travel to Scotland, make sure that your kilt isn't too short, right. Because you're going to jump around. There's plenty of exciting music at the Second annual Loch Lomond festival on the 21st and 22nd of June. And the line up there, if you can believe it, listen to this-- The Jam, The Tourists.

[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] BROOKS: Marvelous. This is just what I was looking for. [LAUGHS] Virginal white so you, Antonia. Family photographs. How desperately middle class. Very Sarah Ferguson. Now, this must have been the early '80s. Just after I was thrown out of that bizarre school. 400 boys in the middle of North Yorkshire with nothing to do. They despised it. I thought it was Christmas every day. Your mother photographed so well. Such a shame. Overdose wasn't it? That must be about a year ago now. The poor bunny. I was just starting to get to know her. Such a messy business. Antonia, treasure, quick toot before breakfast? Brooks, I think it's time you went home. What? Come on, I'll drive you to the station. Oh, not that ghastly train journey again.

I don't blame you. I blame myself. I just had to go. But why, for Christ's sake, why? I can't go on [INAUDIBLE] as it was. I've seen the way she looks at you. It's a phase. It's rejection time. She only acts that way with me because I'm not her father. You are, you bloody fool. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [CRYING] She's mine? Sandy, what the hell did you tell me? I couldn't tell you. She always thought Tom was her father. That's the way we wanted it. Tom and I had no complications. How was I to know you'd come back after he left? You wouldn't understand. I would have. I would have. You know I would have. Oh, leave me alone. I can see the way you look at her. Don't tell me there's nothing going on. Maybe you'll think differently about it now you know she's your own bloody daughter. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Liz. Liz, please come back. [SINGING] Heavens, how I hate pink and those shoes. Thanks for coming for me, Tony. Sorry I'm late. What's the problem? Well, I've just been fucking fired. Come on, let's get out of here. TONY: Well, you know how these agency types get when they're socially challenged. It's all right. Tony [INAUDIBLE] Smith will see you through. Was that a horse in the middle of the street? [MUSIC PLAYING] [FOOTSTEPS] Hi. SAM: Hi. Mum's gone, isn't she? Yes, Sandy. Your mother is gone. Oh, Sam. I'm so sorry. Are you? Are you? Yes, I am-- for you. Is she coming back? I don't know. What are you going to do? Stay here with you. [CHUCKLING] You're something. Sandy, I-- I don't think that would be very wise. Doesn't matter. I'm a big girl now, Sam. [INAUDIBLE]. Talk about it, eh? You going out? Well, I was. But I can stay if you want me to. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Then you go on out, have some fun. There's a good girl. Don't worry about me. I'll have lots of fun.

Come on, get him up. Oh, bollocks. [CHAINS RATTLING] Good god, Mr. Stringer. Bit rough this morning for you, eh? Can't offer you a cappuccino down here, mate. You're making life very difficult for me, Quinlan. What, a little lonely? Nattie's dead. The murder squad would have had you by now if I hadn't stepped in. Well, you always were a prick, Max. This prick saved your ass in [INAUDIBLE].. Yeah. Well, lay low for a while. I'll do what I can for you, but after that, we are finished, friend. You owe me, Stringer.

Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Hi. Antonia, it's for you. TONI: Catch you later. I've got to go. MIKE: All right. ANTONIA: Oh, it's you. Surprise, surprise. Come on up, upstairs and round to the left. Hi. - Hey. How the hell did you find me? Ah, that's top secret information. I mean, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. Oh. This is a cool place. Yeah, it is, isn't it? Not that it's going to stay that way for long because my father's employed that girl he just bumped into to do the place up. What's this, your summer flat? That's my dad's house in the country. But that's going to stay the same way. Jesus. What's it cost to heat a place like this? Well, if you have to ask, you can't afford it. There you go. Do you want a drink or something? Yeah, that'd be great. Anything, iced tea, Diet Coke, whatever. I can probably manage a warm Coke. Warm Coke. You know, I've been here for two and 1/2 years, and I still haven't figured that one out. Well, you'll have to start bringing your own ice supply next time you come. You're not going to stiff me again? Huh? Last night at eight o'clock, we were supposed to get together. Look, I'm sorry about that. I really am. Hey, that's all right. Just don't let it happen again. ANTONIA: No, no, I'm really sorry. It's just, you see-- well, I had a really awful day at work. Well, actually, I lost my job. And so I just got my old friend Toni to come pick me up and cheer me up. Ah. Listen, I'll make it up to you, promise. All right then. How about that warm Coke? ANTONIA: [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Hey, Louie. Hey, gov. No, nothing really. [INAUDIBLE] inside though.

Where's Antonia. I just left her. She's around the corner and through the woods and in the bathroom. Could be a long wait. Tell me about it. You Mike? Yeah. I'm a friend of Antonia's.

Nice talking to you. - Bye, Sandy. See ya. Home sweet home. Hey, love, you know what? I think I just want to go to bed. That's cool with me. No, no, actually do you think-- do you think you could go? I really quite want to be alone. [LAUGHING] Come here. No, no! I mean it. Please. Really. Yes. [SCOFFS] You just-- Yeah, I know. I'm just-- Fuck, here. OK. Call you tomorrow. Yeah, sure.

[INAUDIBLE] Thank you. You wait there. Well, if it isn't Antonia's little friend. You're up kind of late aren't you? I was just going to bed. Then go to bed. If you're that bored, start without me. Are you American? I thought so. Listen, next time you come here, what do you think this is Buckingham Palace but grander. No arguments, no messing about, do as you're told. Otherwise, you don't get to have fun. This world is disintegrating. No, princess, you've got to learn to behave yourself, or you'll make Tony angry. Up you go. Did you get it? Thanks. Where you going? Bathroom. You're not gonna go to the bathroom every time you want get high. I don't care. What do you wanna do that shit for anyway? I like it. I don't do it very much anyway, just from time to time. Feel better? [EXHALES] Yeah. Getting there. Thank you. Thank you. [MOANING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] Wait here a moment. Antonia. [SNORING] Harry, what's going on? Tell her, Charlie, it's the last bloody check until she does something about this. Harry, it's not that simple. Oh, yes, it is. It bloody is. Oh, no, Harry-- Now look, it's the last bloody check. I don't want to hear any more. [KNOCKING] Sandy. Sandy. [HUFFING] Hi. Look. Can you take this to Tony Vernon-Smith's house? You know, the house you went to yesterday? And then this to my bank please. You think I'm stupid? What? You think I like this? Why do you treat me like a fucking messenger boy? Because that's what you are. [CHUCKLES] Ah, you. I thought we had something more happening here. I mean, with last night and all. I'm sorry. Yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just that I feel like shit today. If you could do this for me, and then I'll be fine when you get back. Yeah, I'm sure. Please. - This one time. - Thank you. That's it. Thanks. [OPERA MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL RINGING] Nancy, it's really so simple. Listen, you give me the money, I don't have your limbs broken. Yes. No tears please. Oh, listen, why don't you come over here later, and we can talk it through. Mmm? Love me? Yes, you, too. Silly little slag. Ahh! It's my American friend. Sit down. Long time, no see. Yes, thank you. Wake, Herbie. How you doing? Ahh, it's from our lovely-- what's her name-- Gloria. Antonia. Oh, yes. I'm willing to bet that your relationship with this good lady is a little bit more involved than one normally establishes with one's tradespeople. You Americans still believe that our royal family represents the British aristocracy. Wrong! Absolutely wrong. Let me tell you about class, dear boy. Queen of England, she may be, aristocratic she certainly is not. Poor duck has to remain accessible to the public. Let be public in one's affairs and aristocratic is a contradiction in terms. I'm afraid the whole family are non-entities and middle class. I, on the other hand, don't give a tinker's fart for the rank and file. You are rather sweet. If you just get the stuff, and I'll be going. [SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] My father once told me-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] OFFICER: Clear these stairs. Out of the way. TONY: Ah, come in, gentlemen. Come in. Please arrest them all. You know they've been boring the shit out of me. (STAMMERING) I was-- I was-- I was-- I was just leaving. You're not going nowhere. TONY: Get back here. Arrest them. You, get up. You're coming with me. And you as well. I don't even know these-- Shut up and come on. Fucking long-haired friends of Jesus. Antonia. Yes. Can we talk? What? You sit down, please. You spoken to your father? No, but he left me a lovely little check. Yeah, he's left you a lovely little message as well. Yeah? You're not going to get another penny out of him until you clean up. Well, what have you been saying to him? I haven't told him anything. I haven't had to. He's seen everything. Jesus, I wish you'd stay out of my life. I don't seem to have much option right now. [DOOR SLAMMING] So let's start again. You were on a job, and you had no idea what was going down? Right. What do you want to hear? What you want me to say? You didn't notice anything? Didn't this delivery strike you as being a bit weird? I mean, the place was like a fucking fog bank? What do you mean a little bit weird? I'm a delivery man. I pick shit up and drop shit off. That's my fucking job. God. OK, would you like another coffee? Tea? Hmm? Yeah, thank you. [INAUDIBLE] Anything? Nothing. Wrong place, wrong time. The guy doesn't always ass from his elbow. Oh, Jesus, Stringer. What we doing busting Tony Vernon-Smith? One phone call. That's all he made. He was out of this station quicker than Linford bloody Christie. Complete waste of time. Anthony Vernon-Smith, where is he? The place was basically empty, no delivery, just some personal-- - Don't piss me about. Where the fuck is he? He's gone, gov. Jesus Christ, what's all that about? Search me. He's completely lost it this time. What should I do about Stone? - What, the Yank? - Yeah. - Best let him go. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Bird who's name's on that check he had? She's in reception. Wants to see someone. Yeah? Yeah. Well, I think I'll have a [INAUDIBLE] of that. After you, mate. Look here, you, I'm sick to fucking death of this. I want to see your supervisor and I want my fucking check back! - There's no need to swear. - You! Do you have my check please? Cheers, [INAUDIBLE]. Ms. Dyer, is there a problem? Yes, there is a problem. I'd like my check back please. It's OK. It's sorted. Do you always use a biker? Occasionally. It's a bit pricey isn't it? Yes, well, money doesn't happen to be amongst one of my problems. Can I have my check please? OK, OK. We don't want to keep madam waiting do we? All right, gov. Jesus Christ, lose yourself. Thank you. Any time, madam. Don't you want to see your errand boy? [EXHALES DEEPLY] DISPATCH: Yeah, 5-4-5-4 [INAUDIBLE].. Where are you? Yeah, 5-4. DISPATCH: Mike, where have you been, for christ sakes? Been trying to get a hold of you all bloody morning. Give me a break would you. I had kind of a late one. DISPATCH: Yeah, well, I got a job for you, believe it or not. [INAUDIBLE] if you want it. Where's Frank? You got anybody else? Call him or something 'cause it's just not a good time for me. DISPATCH: No, it's the perfect time. It's your agency, bird. OK. OK, I'm on it. DISPATCH: She wants to meet you at Jake's [INAUDIBLE] Hollywood Road. Said she's really sorry or something. [CHUCKLES] Have a chat [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, here he is. Mike. Come over here Hey. I'm really sorry. Don't worry about it. Hi, I'm Mike. You all right? Yes, fine [INAUDIBLE] but I'm back. [CHUCKLES] [GROANS] You awake? Yeah. Barely. [COUGHS] Do you want anything? Just you. Listen, I've got to go out. OK. I'll just get my things. You can come, too, if you want. Where are you-- where are you going? I've just got to go to this party I promised to go to. But it'll be fun. Come. Parties-- ANTONIA: Come I'm terrible at parties. Come on. You'll be fine. It's at my friend Brooks' house. It'll be good. I thought I'd find you here. Well, you found me. Now bugger off. Suit yourself. I don't know about the next time. Clive, think you're mistaking me for someone that gives a toss. You know what you are? STRINGER: I know what I am. Not like I wish I did. Lose our souls out there. Banging their arms up, snorting their coke. If we don't fuck 'em up, they do it themselves. Not the Tony Vernon-Smiths of this world. They buy whatever and whoever they want. CLIVE: We know that, but what have we got? Hmm? Where's the proof? No one blows the gaff and once their hooked, they're running scared. We should never have busted Vernon-Smith. We've been watching him for weeks. It was best to leave. Meanwhile we get the tadpoles, and the sharks stay off the line. What are we left with? Sweet FA. Liz is gone, Clive. - What? - She's gone. She's pissed off. You know, Clive, I think maybe we work too hard. All I wanted was to even up the score a little, screw up a few plans, put a few of the big bastards in hospital and I could retire FA. Nothing else works, you know that. No big deal for you is it? New copper. You haven't seen the changes during the last 15 years. CLIVE: Don't let it get personal, sir. It's not personal. No, Clive, it's not personal. It's frustrating you. It's confusing you. See you, Clive. [MUSIC PLAYING] (RAPPING) There's someone to backstab to grab what you have, milk you like cornflakes soon as the door breaks. Fakes around you all the while behind your back, they diss you. In your face they smile and grin their teeth. We're still [INAUDIBLE] so the life is not-- Don't worry. She'll be here soon. I don't even want to be here right now. You know, I go get her dope for her, I get thrown in jail, but don't stiff me at this fucking party. I don't wanna be here with these idiots. Let's go. [ENGINE RUNNING] I just hope those drunks aren't invited to the party. Ah, sweetheart! Oh, no, you're not leaving? Brooks' parties are always wonderful. What difference does it make? She's a big girl. She can go wherever she wants. Listen I tell you, if you take her, I'll send you the bill for her services. Oh, hello. How are you? How good to see you. I hate party poopers. What a beautiful-- I'd really like to kick that guy's ass. Brooksy! There you are. Brooksy, what have you [INAUDIBLE]?? You got any concept as to what's happening to you? Not now, Charlie, please. If not now, when? Let me in. You're ruining your life. I'm ruining my life? Well, that's funny 'cause it seems to me like you're ruining my life. Everywhere I turn, you're standing there nagging me. You're even-- you're even changing my mother's house. Antonia, mummy's dead. And your father's employed me here to make a fresh start, and that's what I'm trying to do. That's what you need to do.

[GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [BELL TOLLING] REPORTER: Antonia Dyer, 25-year-old daughter of industrialist Harry Dyer, was found close to death on the banks of the River Thames in Chelsea this morning. Police say that no foul play is suspected but would nevertheless like to hear from anybody who may have seen her last night. [INTERPOSING VOICES] She's conscious, gov. Remembers nothing. But I think it's only a matter of time. Did she say anything? No, nothing. I'm going to go back up to the hospital, have another talk. You want to come? Well, is that a yes or a no? [INTERPOSING VOICES] Did you see that? Bloke hasn't got [INAUDIBLE] in the [INAUDIBLE].. Look, Jess, remember Stringer's face when this Antonia came into the station? Yeah? Well, I found these in his drawer last night. Mr. Stringer? He's not been right lately. In all the time I've been with him, he's never behaved like this. Yeah, well, he's always had a tendency. Apparently, guys in surveillance said he was right off it last week. His wife, Liz, she's done all right. My heart bleeds for him. Look, keep an eye on him, yeah. And this Dyer girl. I recommend you suss out the connection fast, yeah. You're right. OK. Excellent. Thanks. Yeah, can I keep these? You perv. [CHUCKLES] Eh, Clive, times change. People like Stringer, nah. Yeah. Catch you later. Yeah. Oy, piss off and get a proper job. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Vultures. Come on, lads. Back it up then. Come on. All the way. Back in the top of the stairs. Come on then, lads. Go. Moving up. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Mike. MIKE: What the fuck happened to you? Oh, nothing. Nothing. I'm fine. - Don't give me that. I waited all night for you at the party. I know. Calm down. It's no big deal, OK. I'm fine. I've just got a bit of a bash on the back of my head, but it's fine. I'm dying for cigarette. Have you got one please? You're unbelievable. What do you mean? They pulled you out of a fucking river. What are you trying to do to yourself? How are these drugs and this fucking lifestyle that you're living? What, you don't wanna hear this right now? This bothers you right now? If you're so pissed off, why did you come? You don't know. You can't see it. Look, I really want to-- Because you don't even recognize you have a problem. Well, if you did, you might let me in. I've what? You know, you gotta love yourself first. I'm not the enemy here. I mean, every once in a while, I see the real Antonia. I get a glimpse of the Antonio that cares. I do care. But right now, I'm too scared to care. No, the police are going to come back. I don't want them to find me here. I want to get out. Do you understand that. I want to leave. Yeah. Yeah, we can run away. Just as long as we get the fuck out of London because you need a break. - OK, fine. Let's just go. Look, I still don't think this is a good idea. It's a perfect idea. We're safe out here. Go on. No! What are you doing! [SCREAMING] MIKE: What happened to you? Oh, nothing. Nothing. I'm fine. MIKE: They pulled you out of a fucking river. What are you trying to do to yourself huh? STRINGER: Seems to me you're waiting for somebody. MIKE: Do you wanna die? You don't want to hear this right now? This bothers you right now? What do you wanna do that shit for anyway? CHARLIE: You got any concept as to what's happening to you? Your choice, your decision. You can do it. [CHUCKLES] You know, my old dad liked reading. [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Oh, really? STRINGER: Yeah. He wouldn't relate to you though, Mr. Brooks. This is actually my parents' apartment. STRINGER: Well. Well, it's lovely. Quite lovely. Yeah, such beautiful things. [CRASHING] [GASPING] Oh! I'm so sorry. [WHIMPERING] You sure you don't know where she is? I've already told you, I've got no idea. Yeah, what I don't understand is this. You're from the same manner. You're almost one of the family. You're dealing drugs. I beg your pardon. Oh, yes, you do. So when she gets nervous and runs from hospital, who best to know where she is, eh? I think she's in the country. Thank you, Mr. Brooks. [INAUDIBLE] Brooksy. You know what I'm going to do? No, Max, what are you going to do? Oh, Mr. Stringer. I thought I told you to stay put. Yeah, well, he owes us, and we got to make a living. Call your friend in. What? You haven't the guts to do this on your own. Call him in. Spider, in here. I'll just go and feed the meter. STRINGER: You'll shut up, and you'll stay there. You, scupper. What? Will you do us the honor of pissing off? Yes, right. Excuse me. All right. Well, now. Isn't this an interesting situation? I've been wanting to have a word with you boys. Hey, how you doing? Do you want coffee or something? No, that's all right. It's all right. What's the matter? Are you finding all this a bit-- a bit hard to handle? No. You know, not everyone goes cold turkey, you know. Don't bullshit me. Hmm? MIKE: It's written all over you. What is? I know you're using again. No, I'm not. I'm not. [SIGHS HEAVILY] I really want us to work out. I'm not kidding. But don't lie to me. Don't fucking lie to me. Mike. Look, just go get your head straight. Need a little time to think. Shit. MIKE: I'll just be a second. I'll be out in a second, OK. Sir, you can't come in dressed like that. MIKE: I'm looking for Mr. Dyer. Boyfriend of my daughter's. Hi, Harry. Get out. This will just be a second. You know, while you sit here and pretend that everything's OK, your daughter's taking heroin. Maybe-- just maybe if you would talk to her and admit that you love her, she might have a chance. What are you after? Money? No, sir. I'm just looking for her father. Long-haired American shit. Sorry about this. I don't know why you're here. I've been vile to you and Mike. We care about you. Mike cares about you. He doesn't care what you are. He cares who you are. It's not you. It's the drugs. You're not worthless. Listen, I'm going to go. We'll see you for dinner. Yeah? Thanks. It'll be OK. I doubt it. Antonia. Darling. What are you doing here, dad? What's going on? Your American friend interrupted my lunch. As I leave the club, newspaper man asked for my comments about your attempted suicide. Well, that's ridiculous. I didn't try to kill myself. It was an accident. And he's not what you think he is. The American? Perhaps. I've known for a long time about this drug business. I had to cut you off. I had no choice because your mother's death. And that kind of thing. I know. I'm sorry I've caused you so much pain. But, um, well, I just didn't think I could really talk to you anymore. I mean, you're always in the city, you know, doing deals and your business. I often thought you'd prefer it if I'd been a boy. I always loved you. Just I'm not very good at showing it. At least you're safe. Please stay for a while. If there's anything I can do, tell me. Thank you. Yeah, breakthrough. It was Max who tossed her in the drink. Why she must have been ripping him off. Yeah. Well, she'll need protection won't she? So get there, stick to her, and don't let her out of your sight. What are you up to? You and Spider stay put and get ready for action. Now hang on a minute. No, you hang on a minute. I've covered your back, Max. I've let you get by with your [INAUDIBLE] nonsense for as long as I care to remember. Now it is payback time. You do this, and you're free and clear. You'll not let me down will you, Max? You don't know that. You just told your [INAUDIBLE] I did it. Now stick with her, I don't mind doing it, but what happens to me? You won't get caught. I need him there. I can't afford to lose her again. I'll make sure he's not around when you take her out. Well, what happens to the bloke? Trust me, Max. Just trust me. I'm gonna fucking have to huh. Hey. Jesus! You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You're looking better. Thanks, I feel like shit. No, I really do. I feel awful, always aching everywhere. That's understandable. ANTONIA: But I'm really glad you here. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Yeah, right. I feel pretty bad though. I mean, you're down here being really nice to me, and I'm a complete nightmare. You teach me a lot. ANTONIA: Really? Patience. Lots of that. You've made me face my fears, and that's what I want to do for you. I can't do it alone. Maybe you need some help. Maybe you should go to some meetings. Oh. No, I don't like the-- MIKE: Why not? I don't wanna tell my life story to a bunch of strangers, thank you very much. MIKE: You might like it if you try it. I'm going to be there. Did you come here to tell me this? You did didn't you? Little recovery. No. Yeah, I was just talking to Charlie. Well, I'll think about it. You think about it. I'll think about it. God, I really love this place. It's not enough is it? [KNOCKING] Come in. Antonia, darling. This is Detective Sergeant Nathan. He needs to speak to you. All right, I'll just leave you. Are we good? Oh, yeah. Please sit down. Thank you. What's the matter? A man we need to catch is looking for you. For your safety, your father has agreed to let me stay here. Well, who is it? CLIVE: Max Quinlan. I don't know how you've upset him, but you have. I've never heard of him. Ms. Dyer, we met once before, and we didn't get along too well. Now I need your cooperation. If you know where he's after you, tell me. Look, I've never heard of him. I don't know who he is. Why don't you just arrest him? Because we don't know where he is. But we're pretty sure he's going to be here. Antonia, if you know anything, you tell this man. Don't keep anything from him. I'm telling you, I have the faintest idea what he's talking about. Look, can we talk about this later? I'll show you to your room, Sergeant. You come this way please. [PHONE RINGING] Nathan. STRINGER: It's me, Clive. Oh, hello, gov. Any news? STRINGER: Well, I'll say. It's tonight, Clive, just before dawn. I'll meet you in the road outside of the house at 3:00. Listen, they're some gates at the entrance at the driveway. You can't miss them. I'll meet you there. Good boy. There you are. He'll be out of the frame. You got a clean run at it. Sweet as a nut. Yeah, sure. A trip to the country. How wonderful. That'll be them now I expect. Harry, honestly these meetings will help. It's not just talk. I think more than anything, she's going to feel relieved to find out she's not alone. I hope she doesn't end up hating me. I know she blames me. No. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. I'll go get them some food. You all right? HARRY: I just want to say thank you, and I apologize. I think I made the mistake of taking you at face value. I thought you were-- well, it doesn't matter what I thought you were. I was wrong, and I'm sorry. That's-- that's quite all right, sir. I'm going to go help Charlie. Sit down, darling. How was this meeting? Well, I think is pretty interesting. I know you blame me, well, for everything. I hadn't realized how unhappy you were. It's like a replay of your mother. What do you do when you find you've done everything wrong? You know, I don't blame you for everything. I mean, I think I used to, but, um, well, I'm beginning to see that, well, I've been pretty silly myself. Makes two of us. Tell you what, shall we try to start and trust each other. Hmm? All right. (SINGING) What you want you know what I got to bring what you need. You better leave my hambone alone. Gotta keep on running the road like a rolling stone. You better leave my hambone-- [SNIFFING] Take it. SPIDER: Fuck off. Take it. Do I have to? Oh, yes, you do. [PHONE RINGING] Nathan. Clive, I've arrived. CLIVE ON PHONE: [INAUDIBLE] Look, don't worry, Clive. Backup is on its way. I promise you. CLIVE ON PHONE: [INAUDIBLE] Oh, is she? Good. Is the boyfriend with her? Right. Yeah. Well, I'll meet you by the gates in 15 minutes. That's four minutes past the hour, OK. Right. You heard. You got 15 minutes to get ready. Now she's in bed. Now you know where her bedroom is don't you? Yeah. What about the boyfriend? Well, you do what you have to do. Meet me on the lawn once it's over. What about your bloke? He won't be around. Now trust me. OK. I'm glad you're here. I'm glad I'm here, too. Clive's still here isn't he? Yes, he's just in the hall. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] SPIDER: He's gotta be up here right. [RAIN POURING] [SCREAMING] Come on. Come on. [SCREAMING] Shit. [GRUNTING] No, please! What? What's the matter? They're in there. Please, I feel so ashamed. I'll watch you to go in first. No, it'll be OK. I'll back you up with a gun. ANTONIA: Look, I went to score some drugs off this guy, and I was raped, OK. Sam. [CRYING] Come in, Sam. [SOBBING] Where the fuck are you? [COCKS GUN] (WHISPERING) What was that? [SCREAMING] Oh, fuck! [GUNSHOT] SPIDER: Oh, god! [GUNSHOT] Shit. SPIDER: Come on, let's fucking go. He's got my gun! Come on! Come on, Max! I'm gonna go get Clive. Come on, Sam. Fuck it. OK. Where is he? Where is he, eh? Where is he? He's here. He's here. Shut up! Well done, boys. [INAUDIBLE] Shut up. Gov'ner-- I said shut up.

I'll meet you in [INAUDIBLE]. Just get in the car. I gotta find Clive. I'll meet you there. [CAR STARTS] Go, go, go. Where the hell is she gone? What are you doing? Where have you been? What the hell's going on? CLIVE: Jesus Christ. Jesus, Same, where were you? Got him, Clive. I got him. I can't find the girl. No, look, it's all right. She's safe. What? Yeah, she's just driven away. I know where she's gone. [SINGING] [POLICE SIRENS] [INAUDIBLE] Take upstairs. You, in there. He's here! STRINGER: My god. Sandy. It's not my fault. It takes two to tango you know. The dance is over. That's my daughter. [GUNSHOT] MIKE: Antonia! [GUNSHOT] Put the gun down, Sam. Put it down. Jesus Christ. Why? Fucking why? I had to, Clive. Sandy, they would have-- [INAUDIBLE] And the girl? STRINGER: That one? She was nothing. Junkies. Once a junkie, always a-- (SINGING) This is a longing inside my head, no mirrors to reflect. [INAUDIBLE] season of joy or the season to inject. [INAUDIBLE] they talk silently and fake the invisible [INAUDIBLE]. Tell me your wish is more righteous [INAUDIBLE] Friends won't answer your phone calls. Call your long distance family. Well, I hope someone is listening Where's the signal [INAUDIBLE]. As you sing on bandaged knees. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) I need someone's hand to lead me through the night. I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight. 'Cause when the night begins I'm at an end because I need your love so bad. I need some lips to feel next to mine. Need someone to stand up, tell me when I'm lying. 'Cause when the lights are low and it's time to go, that's when I need your love so bad. Why don't you give it up. Bring it on home to me or write it on a piece of paper, darling so it can be read to me. Tell me that you love me and stop driving me mad because I-- I need your love so bad. Need your soft voice talk to me at night. Don't want you to worry, baby, 'cause I know we can make everything all right. Listen to my plea, baby. Bring it home to me because I need your love so bad.
