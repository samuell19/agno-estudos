(A Tiger in Winter) Eat your breakfast. Get up and eat. What's all this? What do you mean? Something going on today? My parents are coming. Huh? They'll arrive around noon. Why so sudden? They said before they'd come. Since I never go. I heard something like a tiger's roar. Did you? Yeah... One escaped from the zoo. It was on the news earlier. Why? How would I know? It can't be helped. What can't? Nothing. Can you find somewhere to stay for a couple of days? Would that be better? What then? Are you just going to stay? No. I should meet them sometime. Gyeong-yu. Do you want to meet my parents this time for an engagement meeting? Yesterday... I got fired. Quit or fired? It's all the same. I can still work at night, so don't worry. Gyeong-yu. Can't you... Huh? Can't you give it another try? Try what? Never mind. What is it? No appetite today. I'll hurry pack my things and go. Its cold, go inside. Okay. I'll come in two days. Air the place. Get rid of the man smell. Gyeong-yu. Yeah? What? You have something to say? No, watch out for the tiger. Just in case. All right. You have money? Don't worry. Boo-jung! Boo-jung! What are you doing here? Why didn't you answer your phone? Let me stay for two days. What the hell is this on a Saturday morning? Something came up. Were you thrown out? No. Stop it! Stop it. Put that down. I'm freezing to death! I've got a guest. A very difficult one. A woman? You think it's a guy? I can use the small room. Introduce me. Introductions are for people you're glad to see. Today's impossible. Can't you help me out? She's really difficult. Then at least take this. You had a fight? So when will that difficult woman go? Who knows, idiot? I'll call you. Bye. In your work experience, you only list a driver's license. I have nothing else to list. Young kids these days are a handful, and they quit in no time. So we do prefer older workers like you... I see. You won't quit on us? Of course not. But why didn't you work all these years? Be honest. You'll rather not say? I was writing. Writing? A novel. Ah, you mean like a blog? No. I was writing on my own, but not anymore. Wow, you were a novelist. But does anyone read novels these days? I read some when I was in school. What was the title? I even forgot it. Anyway, we'll think it over and call you back. These jobs are more competitive than you'd think. - Did you know that? - No. If you haven't eaten, want to try our new burger? Yes sir, I'm almost there. If you wait just a minute... What? Sir, I'm almost there. If you cancel on my way to... Did you call a driver? I just arrived. Yes, I see you. How have you been? Guess I should call another driver? It's been ages. It has. I'll call another driver. No, it's fine. How late do you work? Well, it depends. Have time for a coffee? Are you married? No. And you? Yes. Really? Congratulations. Working as a designated driver at night? Huh? Yeah, most likely. You look the same. How's your writing? I quit. I stopped writing. Really? I'm late, but congratulations. For what? The national literary contest. Thank you. - I'd haven't read your novel yet. - It's nothing special. I'll read it some time. You really quit writing? I was just hanging on, with no talent. It's a relief, but I have no other skills. Just getting old. You dating anyone? Yeah. You are good at that, anyway. I don't know. You're doing well? With a literary career. Sure, I'm getting by, it's not too bad. Glad to hear that. We better go, it's late. Right. I'll call another driver. No, you do it. Me? Otherwise, I'll have to wait again. Does it make you feel uncomfortable? Is it awkward? It's okay. With the escaped tiger still at large, citizens are alarmed. Zoo employees say not to move if you encounter the tiger. It's best to play dead on the ground. - Here. - Thanks. Bye. No, it's okay. Take it. It's fine. Go ahead. Take it. Thanks. For what? Sorry for taking up your time. It's fine. Go ahead. Okay. Bye, then. Bye. Still, it's good to see you. Watch out for the tiger. Sure. Boo-jung! Boo-jung! It's cold, you jerk. Damn you. All right, come in. What's your problem? Come on. Hey, mister. Hey. Get up. Where am I? You're in heaven, bastard. Come and eat breakfast. How did I get in last night? You broke up with her? No. Then why did you come with a suitcase? I'll go back tomorrow. You're a pain in the ass. What are you hiding? Nothing. Sure. Living off someone else can't be easy, right? Hey. What? I'm getting married. Again? This time... I think I'm really in love. Yeah. Really? What the hell? Didn't you hear? I'm getting married. Sure, congrats. Hey. If you got a problem, you need to tell me, so I can respond or something! Can I borrow a suit? Why a suit? Just for a day. This is better than any translation yet. I wish I can write just one novel like this. I love you. From Gyeong-yu. Who are you? Hello, ma'am. My name is Han Gyeong-yu. Hyun-ji's boyfriend. Hyun-ji? Hyun-ji? Yes, ma'am. It's nice to meet you. We just moved in today. What? You must be looking for the girl who moved out. How could you not know your girlfriend is moving? You moved in today? She left early this morning. We just moved our things in. Try calling her. Bye. The number you have dialed is not in the directory. Please check the number and call again. The number you have dialed is not in the directory. Please check the number and call again. You're still here? - Hello. - Hi. I was away for a while. Huh? What do you mean? I didn't know she was moving. How could you not know? When did you ask her to move out? Well, the lease is ending. So a month ago, I said I'd have to raise the rent. She said she couldn't afford it but my father refused to budge. You must have a big fight. She didn't say where she was going? I wouldn't know that. Did you call her? I thought it was strange not seeing you this morning. Goodbye, then. Yes, goodbye! By any chance, did you call a driver? Oh yes. Good evening! Mister. Why didn't you answer his greeting? What? You arrive from the country? - Hey, stop it. - Let go of me! When you meet a customer, you should greet him first. Right? - Sorry. - Sorry? Why does everyone just want to slack off? We called you ages ago. Let's just go, okay? Sorry, mister. Let's go now. I'm sorry. I was distracted. - Let's go. - Wait. I'm the one who says when we go. Just let go. What, did I offend you? - Isn't this a service industry? - Hey, stop. Sorry mister, let's go. Cut it out! I'm sorry, but you better call another driver. Oh really? Mister. Why should I have to wait again? I'm a busy man! - Hey, forget it. - Don't freaking touch me! Mister I'm sorry. Let's just go, okay? Cut it out! Let's go. Let's go. Come on! Can't you hear? Let's go! Where the hell are you going? Goddamn it! Wait, wait! Won't you stop? - Let's go. - Is it my fault? - No. - Damn, is it my fault? No, it's my fault. I apologize. Let's go. Come on! You home? What the hell happened to you? Let's drink some soju. On a Sunday night? I've got to work tomorrow. Then roast this. This here... This... here is Korean beef! Prime grade. Boo-jung. Let's... Let's eat it ourselves! Let's roast it. This here... Let's eat it... What's with you? Boo-jung. Boo-jung... (On the day the tiger escaped, I...) The cries of the tiger resounded. It was winter and it had nowhere to go. Still, it didn't miss its old cage. (Eat something, you loser!) Call me. This is Yoo-jung. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Excuse me. Yes? I'm sorry, but can I see Hyun-ji? Hyun-ji? She no longer works here. Since when? It's been more than a month. I'm a friend but I can't reach her. Did something happen? No, nothing special. Last month many temp workers were let go. Ah I see. You didn't hear if she moved to another job? No, she isn't the type to talk about herself. If you see her later, tell her I said hi. Have you eaten? Guess you're not working. You're home early. No date tonight? Date, my ass. What can I do with you moping around here? Hey. Seriously? Stop causing a scene, will you? Huh? How long can I stay here? Why? You want me out? Damn it. I've been meaning to tell you. We won't have a separate wedding. She's just going to move in. When? We can take our time moving her stuff. Okay, I'll be honest. She's supposed to move in today. Sorry. Sure. Say something. You're driving me crazy. Uh? What the hell is going on? I'll just go now. Sorry. No need to leave now, stay for the night and leave tomorrow. I want to be alone. How do you think I'll feel if you do this? Don't bother. Just sleep here tonight. I'll call you when I get settled. Hey! No need to come out. Get in. Call me, for sure. Hello? It's Yoo-jung. I texted you before. Yeah, sorry. Can I see you now? Is it a bad time? No, let's meet. How about Starlight? Okay. Bye. You're not busy? Not really. Sorry. - For what? - Well... So you had something to tell me? It's a bit weird asking this after so many years... but I want your help. Help? Funny, huh? I need to write a short story... I thought I could work it out if time passes, but it didn't work out. And I'm way past the deadline. So? I just thought, if we talked like we used to, I might be able to work it out. Funny, huh? What help would I be? I'm not asking for anything, I just wanted to talk it over... How's married life? Does it suit you? I'm not married. The other night, I... I don't know why I said that. Sorry. I see. What does your girlfriend do? She works in a company. You two are happy? - It's fine. - I'm glad. Is it okay to meet like this? I don't want to cause you trouble. Have a good night. Thanks. You'll take a taxi? I'll walk a bit first. Okay. Thanks, good night. Hello. Yeah. I got back fine. Yeah. What? Okay. What? What is it? Sorry. Sorry. It won't work. Want me to do it? No. It's been a while. It won't work. It's okay. They say it happens if you drink a lot. It's okay, really. Want to smoke? No, I quit. Here. Thanks. It's been a while, hasn't it? It has. - Did you drink? - Yes. A little. You know... What? Here... Yeah? This apartment... Should I tell you my passcode? I'm not drunk. No, really. Isn't it awkward? You don't have to, but if you want... I'll think about it. Tastes good. - Go on in. - Okay. - Bye. - See you. Gyeong-yu. Will you think about it? Shall I turn on the heater? You seem to have a cold. The heater might help... Jesus, will you be quiet? I'm thinking about something important. Yes, sorry sir. Don't answer! Just keep quiet. - Here you go. - Yeah. Do you take cards? What? I'm out of cash, do you take credit cards? I'm sorry, we don't. Don't you have a card reader? I'm sorry, Sir. This is annoying. I'll wait here, if you want to get cash. All right. Your call cannot be connected. Please leave a message. Ma'am. We're here. Ma'am, we arrived. We're here? My head. My fee, please. What's this? What's this scratch? What? Where did this scratch come from? Did you scrape it? It must have already been there. What are you talking about? It was fine before. What will you do about this? It wasn't me. Please pay my fee. Are you saying you're innocent? Please just pay my fee. What do you take me for? Is it because I'm drunk? It wasn't me. Pay my fee. You people have no responsibility, that's why your life sucks. You know? What did you say? What? What the hell did you say? What do you know? What the hell are you doing? How dare you touch me! Get up. Yoo-jung. Yeah. You're here? Go in and sleep. Stop drinking. What? You can stop now. No, I'm not drunk. Yes, you're drunk. I'm not! I'm not drunk, okay? Sorry. I'm sorry. - Have some water, okay? - Yeah. Here. You okay? Yeah. Get up. Go sleep in bed. Hug me. Hug me. Can you do it today? Sorry. It's okay, no need for sex. Who needs sex? When did you wake up? Just now. My head! Want some water? Yeah. I dreamt of a tiger. It was running at me. But I couldn't take a step. It was so scary. Its face... was so big. It's a good omen. Really? I just said that. Damn. Did they catch it yet? Huh? The escaped tiger. Right... If I met it on the street, I'd be so scared. What will you do today? Need to write... anything. God, I hate it. Can I ask you something? What? - Did you really quit? - Quit what? Writing. Yeah. You're okay with it? Yeah. I don't think of it at all. So, it's really possible. What is? I thought you wouldn't be able to. It was easy. You know that piece you showed me once? - What? - Your novel. Wayfarer. Remember? What about it? Do you still have it? I don't know. Did you ever send it anywhere? It wasn't worth it. I really liked it. It could be fixed up pretty easily. Forget it. How about... if I rewrite it? What? If I fix it up a little. I mean, I think I can improve it. Anyway, you never sent it out. Give it to me. Do you mind? Sure. Did I offend you? I think I overstepped my bounds. Sorry. Forget it, okay? - Did you say, "anyway"? - What? Did you say "anyway"? I just... You think you can say that way if it wasn't published? No, I'm sorry. You, of all people. Huh? I didn't mean it that way. That's why you called me? Right? You needed my novel? Right? You know what it took to write that. You know better than anyone! Don't you? I'm sorry. Sorry. Don't act like this. I was desperate. I'm serious. If you keep drinking... Hey, I said I'm sorry! You don't have to take it this far. Seeing you again, it's still hard. - Bye. - Hey! Thank you. Have you been drinking? What? Can you smell it? It's still afternoon. Just a little. Our editorial board can be quite ruthless. You're closed to being blacklisted. I know. Then how can you act this way? Missing deadlines is common, but not like this. Tell me honestly. How much have you written? - Is it just the ending left? - No. Then half? One-third? I haven't even started. I don't really need to tell you this, but since I love your novel... Without a story collection after you've made a debut, you'll be forgotten. You just need to write one more. I'll write it. I'll talk to the editorial board. But if you late again, rumors fly in this small industry. If you're blacklisted... You know? How many more days will it take? Did you call a driver? Miss, we're here. Is this the right place? There's nothing here. This is right. You can go. Okay. - Leave the car running. - All right. Hello! Hello! Mister. Save me. Can you write down what you told me? - I think I saw a tiger. - What? A tiger. Yes, write this first. How is she? It's good you found her quickly. But no license, it's not her car. Any family? I don't think so. You deserve a medal. You saved two lives. What? She's got a bun in the oven. A bun? She's pregnant. You did a great thing. Didn't even get blood on you. Life just keeps getting harder. Right? Can I see her for a second? Why? I didn't see her face. - I should see her face. - What? Another plagiarism controversy, this time in the literary world. The plot of a prize-winning novel from several years ago. Its summary is very similar to an unknown foreign novel, it's turn out to be plagiarism just now after many years. The young writer in question is Yoo-jung, who won the Spring Literary Contest in 2012 with her debut novel. Five years later, a reader has now accused her of plagiarism. At the moment, we have no response from Yoo-jung, who is out of contact. (Yangsu Station) - Excuse me. - Yes? Do you happen to have a cigarette? I don't smoke. Sorry. 5,000 won. - Just a moment. - Ok. (Hyun-ji) The number you have dialed is not in the directory. Please check the number and call again. (A Tiger in Winter) On a winter day when a woman left a man, a tiger escaped from the zoo. Whether bored with life or for some other reason, the tiger disappeared without leaving a note. The other tiger left behind, without yet realizing it was alone, gulped down the fresh chicken thrown to it by a zookeeper. (The Old Man and the Sea)
