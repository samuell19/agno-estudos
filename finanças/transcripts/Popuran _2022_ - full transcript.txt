Thank you for having us. Pleasure's mine. So here's what we're going for. The video will be called "A Real Look into Successful People's Lives." It's exactly as the name suggests, we'll delve into your background. We'd like to get all your real charms on camera. So if you'll just relax, that'll be perfect. Sounds good. Okay, ready? We're ready. Let's roll. Your manga app Rashimban is a smash hit. It has over seven million downloads. Congratulations. Thank you. First of all, what led you to start this business? Well, I've loved manga ever since I was a little boy. I was the kid that secretly read manga during class. My bookshelves were full of them. Have you ever thought about becoming an author yourself? I wanted to, at first. But I realized early on I wasn't good enough. So I chose to distribute it. I see. Currently, you have many employees. But you started the company with just one other friend. Yes, we worked together at a manga caf√©. The idea was to have authors make original manga for our platform. We started in a small, shabby apartment room. Did you really? I heard your founding partner quit the company two years ago. Yes. There are rumors that you personally fired him. Well... Are those rumors true? Um... Could you explain? I'm sorry, please refrain from such questions. Sorry. I understand. So you got married at 20 and had a child. But you left them to come to Tokyo alone. Can you tell us what went on there? I'm sorry, no personal questions. At the sacrifice of your family... Excuse me, you'll have to stop. But we're here to have a real look into his life. Our viewers would like to know what tough decisions he had to make. I'm sorry, but you can't. So when you came to Tokyo, weren't your parents against it? I chose to follow my ambitions rather than their sentiments. I see. So they're supportive of you now? Yes. That's wonderful. Thank you. Okay, then. To finish it off, can we have a message into the camera for our young viewers? A message? Well... I don't think I'm qualified yet to give much advice, but... When you feel lost, close your eyes. Find out which direction your heart's compass is pointing to. And race in the direction it's pointing you towards. Good luck. Okay, thank you. Perfect. -Thank you. -Sure. Will you send us the final edit? Sure, we'll send it early next week. Thank you. -Good work. -Thank you. Come here. Yeah? What's next? A meeting with the marketing team. After that, it's Mr. Kitahara's birthday party. Oh, yeah, that party. Did you read his latest manga? Nope. What's it about? A monk that becomes a professional wrestler. Wow, fully prepared. I can always count on you. Is it selling? Not really, to be honest. He's famous, but he's sinking. Just read the beginning, and I'm sure you'll be fine. Yeah, I'll read a chapter in the taxi. I'll need a birthday present. I've prepared something. I can always count on you. Mr. Tagami, hi. Hey, what's up? I'll have that project ready by next week. Yeah, good luck. Who's he? Mr. Oda from Editing. He said in last week's meeting he wanted to do an original manga. We're not doing originals. Nobody reads them. I know, right? Happy birthday. Where do you get your incredible ideas? A monk becoming a wrestler. How did you come up with that? You read it? Of course I did. You know how the monk gets all bloody in a fight in Chapter 3? Yeah, that bloody scene. It really happened. That bloody scene was real? I saw a monk in a huge brawl with a drunk guy in Shibuya. He was bleeding from his head, and he landed a chop on the guy. When I saw that, I got a huge hard-on. A hard-on? My soul shouted out, this is it! A hard-on of the soul. That's where it all starts. Wow. That's like something out of a manga, a monk getting in a fight. That's why I made it a manga. It's incredible how you can actually do that. Mr. Kitahara. Hi there! Excuse me. -Thanks for coming. -Happy birthday. Hello, may I introduce myself? Sure. Have a seat. My name is Araki. I'm Mr. Kitahara's assistant. Ms. Araki, nice to meet you. I read manga on Rashimban all the time. It has everything. Even ones I read as a student. I get all nostalgic reading them. Well, thank you. Do you do original works, too? Yeah, sure. We do originals. I'm drawing my own manga. What should I do to be published on Rashimban? -Well... -I'm sorry. Please forget it. I can refer you to the editing team. Really? Oh, wow! Thank you so much. There we go. There. Okay now. Do you know of the unidentified object that's being sighted lately? People were talking about this strange high-speed flying object a while back. Just recently, more sightings have been reported. This is where a sighting was reported three days ago. According to the witness, the "Skyfish" was seen here. It flew past this streetlight, off to the south. The object flew by unusually fast, and it was gone in seconds. Spread it wider. Excuse me. So you woke up, and it was gone. Yes. I'm going to touch it. Does it hurt? No. Maybe just a little itchy. I see. You may get dressed. So here's how it looks right now. If it were cut off, for example, the skin would be damaged, right? And it would hurt. Right. But there's none of that. It's just gone, and there's skin there with just a small hole in its place. Come back tomorrow and we'll see if it's changed any. You may want to go to a big hospital. Mr. Tagami, about the project... Sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Sir, what are you doing? Yeah, well... You know. What's going on? It won't stop. Excuse me. Are you okay? Any fever? I took some medicine. It's better now. Why are you dressed like that? Because comfy clothes are... Well... Comfier. What did you want me for? I need your advice. Yes? What is it? Don't be surprised at what I'm going to say. Okay. When I woke up this morning, "it" was gone. It? Yes, it. What do you mean? What? When I woke up, it was gone. Are you talking about a manga? No, it's about me. A real story about me. You're the only one I could tell this to. I don't... Huh? I know. You can't believe it, can you? Will you take a look? Stop, what are you doing? No, just look! Look and you'll understand. Please, Mr. Tagami! Not at the office. Someone might see us. No, it's not like that. Okay, I'll stand back and show you. I just want you to see. See! Ow! THE POPRAN GROUP Okay, proceed. Please. Name, please. Kazuma Ito. Let me check. Excuse me. I will insert a finger. Okay, proceed. Please. I'm Yuta Sasaki. Let me check. Excuse me. I will insert a finger. Okay. Name, please. Akira Tagami. Let me check. Excuse me. I will insert a finger. Okay, proceed. Please. Name, please. Shinji Fujisaki. Let me check. Excuse me. I will insert a finger. Thirteen, but two canceled, so it's 11. All right, we'll go through it quickly, then. It has not been made public yet, but what has happened to you is occurring all over the country. How your Popran had gone missing when you woke up in the morning. What I must tell you first is that your Popran has not disappeared. It has formed its own will and has left you. So how does one lose one's Popran? The Popran takes two hours to separate itself from the body. Once separated, it uses the Arupito, these parts, like wings to fly. Some reach speeds of 200 km per hour. Six days after the Popran separates itself from the body, it will die from malnutrition. When it nears death, the Arupito will radiate light. This is called Sepical. Three hours after Sepical begins, the Popran will die completely. Now, if you capture your Popran, insert the small peg on the back into the hole in your crotch. Do not let go of your Popran for about an hour. And you will be back to normal. But... Six days. If you can't capture your Popran within six days, it's gone forever. Thank you. It's for peeing while standing. And it's just kind of comforting to have it on. And what's this? To catch your Popran. Normal butterfly nets would just tear. Poprans are strong. This thing is tough. When you catch it... Like so. I see. I'd like to sell mine. You can do that? That's why they have used ones, too. They're so expensive, but you only use them for six days. I came to sell mine today. I don't need it anymore. So, how did it go? I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Well, good luck. Hey. Do you have some time? You don't drink? I have a bad liver. Doctor told me I can't drink. Sorry. No, it's okay. You should drink today. Is that... Yeah, I'm a musician. You look weird carrying that around, so I put mine in this. Are you in a band? Yeah, I used to be. We were a pretty popular indie band, and a record company came to us. And you debuted? Yeah, but there was a condition. I had to go solo. So I did. But my music didn't sell. And your band? The remaining guys kept it going for a while, but they weren't getting anywhere, so they quit. How do I find my Popran? Remember what he said? You know where your Popran has gone. What does that mean? Did you have a dream? I did! Seems like everyone does. I had a dream about my former band, so I went. To the place we had our first concert. Your Popran was there? It flew right past the venue. It got away before I could even get my net. You can have it if you want. I've quit music. I abandoned my band, I abandoned my wife and kid. And now I'm the abandoned one. -Excuse me. -Yes? -A beer, please. -Sure. SIGHTINGS PAINS COMIC SOSEIKI I'm sorry. You are... Is Mr. Yoshida in? One second. Mr. Yoshida, you have a visitor. Long time no see. Sorry for coming so suddenly. I wanted to talk with you. Come in. Can you wait for just a minute? -I can wait. -It's okay. This is the kind of setting I want. But that's just what you want. Comic Soseiki can't have this. Our manga is for little kids, too. So we can't have this kind of stuff. Maybe just a bit? No, don't try to push it. Comic Soseiki is for everyone. Remember what the author said? A family gets lost. They sit and eat hot pot together, right? So we don't need this, got it? -Okay? -I think it's funny. Yeah, I like your passion. But respect the original. Respect the artist more than your opinions. REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE -Okay. -All right, do it. -You're in a band now? -What? Yeah, kind of. Let's go upstairs. To the rooftop. You can leave that there. Sure. -I'm going out. -Okay. How are things? Not bad. It's a small company, but we have fun. I see. I'm glad. It's thanks to you kicking me out that I made this company. I'm grateful. I'm half sarcastic, half serious. The company wouldn't have grown if we did it your way. Past hits instead of originals? Cost over quality? That's your way of doing it. That's how I expanded the business. You sure did. You're one of those big shots that have all the past hits. I didn't come here to fight. Let me fight. Come on! You threw me out without a fight. Ignored all my calls and everything. Okay. Punch me all you like. What? Wait! No fists. Palms only. Wait, how many more? Stop it. Stop making me laugh. Skyfish? Yeah. It's been in the news lately. Really? So what about it? Well... I've got an artist writing a manga about Skyfish right now. So I'm gathering information. You like that stuff, don't you? So I wondered if you knew anything. Like what? Like if you know anyone who's seen it. Or if maybe you've seen it. A Skyfish? Or something like it. No way. That's what you came here for? That's what you do now? But you run the company. Why? Well... I wanted to make an original manga. -I'm back. -Hi. -Going well? -Yes. Remember that? It's from your favorite manga. You forgot? REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE Oh, that? It was broken when we came in this morning. We think maybe some kid threw a rock. Scary stuff, huh? What's wrong? What is it? Hold on, wait. There's nobody there. What the... Are you okay? But there's nobody there. You okay? Hey! What is that? What? Huh? Skyfish? Are you okay? Yeah, I guess the medicine messed me up. It made me say some crazy stuff. So that's what it was? You really scared me. It might make a good manga, though. To find "it" missing when you wake up. Yeah. Anyway, rest up for now. Yeah, I'll be at home for a while. Let me know if anything comes up. Okay, bye. -Bye. -Bye. Sir, are you okay? Yeah... I'm fine. Should I stop the car? No, it's okay. Sir. We're here. DEGUCHI INN Hello? Coming. Welcome... Long time no see. Why? Sorry for coming so suddenly. I wanted to ask you something. Welcome. Who is he? My ex-husband. What? Hi. I'm Tagami. Nice to meet you. I'm Deguchi. I was nearby for work. Sorry for dropping by so suddenly. Not at all. I see. Can I go out for a bit? Sure. You can leave your things here. I'll take this with me. Okay, then. Outside. How did you find me? Facebook. I read about the inn on it, too. So, yeah. Your husband seems like a great guy. Yeah. He is. Your company is doing pretty well, huh? You knew? I saw it on the Internet. Yeah. So what is it? Well, the thing is... Huh? What? Oh, well, you see... I'm looking for a Skyfish. A Skyfish? That urban legend thing? I have a guy writing a manga about it, so I'm gathering information. There were sightings around here. Do you know anything about it? Me? No. Okay. What happened? Let go of me. Sorry. How did you get that? Oh, this? I fell yesterday. Oh. I was walking outside last night, and a bird hit me from behind. What? Can you believe that? A bird? When? I told you, last night. Huh? Wait... What's wrong? What? The guitar case? Hold on! Here it is. What's going on? I'll explain later. Stand back, it's dangerous! I got it... I got it! It's not mine. Who are you? I knew it. See? That mole behind the sack. I'd been searching this area all this time. This is my Popran. Thank you. Thank you. Hey! Are you okay? Stop it! Good, you're up. Are you okay? Yeah. Where am I? A guest room. Where's that guy? He left in a hurry. Said he had something to do. He said he wanted to express his gratitude but had no money, so he left you that. What's going on? Was that the Skyfish? Yeah. That guy was a rival of mine. He was chasing after the Skyfish, too. Too bad, he caught me off guard. He left this behind as an excuse. He just didn't need it. What the... Are you okay? Yeah, thanks. A wiener went flying. A wiener? Dinner's ready, so please stay. Thank you for this food. Right, let's all say it then. Ready? Thank you for this food. Good job. The Skyfish, huh? I thought that was an urban legend. It's not public yet, so if you'd keep it a secret. Sure thing. His wiener went flying. What are you talking about? Wieners are stuck to the body, so they can't go flying. Kids are crazy, huh? What are you doing? You've done it now. Wipe that. -Are you okay? -You're soaked. There you go. -Give me your hand. -You're all wet now. Was it hot? No, it wasn't hot. -Okay, good. -You're all wet. I'll go change him. Yeah. -Thanks. -Let's go get changed. This is wet, too. Sorry about that. Not at all. I'm home. Hi, honey. You were early. Who is he? An old friend of mine. Hi. Good evening. Taking lessons? Yes, dance lessons. Wow. Dance, huh? That's great. Have I met him before? No, you haven't. Really? Okay. -Want dinner? -I'll take a bath first. Okay. You're not staying the night? -No, I... -He's booked a hotel. -You have? -Yes. Oh, well come around anytime. Hope you find your wiener. That again? I will. Where's Haru? She's taking a bath. Can you wait a bit? Oh, don't worry. I'll go see him off. Say bye. Bye. The station is down that way. Okay. Thanks. Have you visited your parents? No. For how long now? About 10 years. You should. Yeah. I'll think about it. I'm glad you're doing well. Me? Well, I mean... All you guys. -Hey... -Don't ever come again. Got it. Bye. Bye. Let's go. Akira. I'm home. What's wrong with you? You idiot... Honey, come quick! Look, Akira's come back. Come on in. Come on, come on. Remember Dai, the kimono shop's son? He married Keiko, the bread shop's daughter. Did he? Their child is four or five now. A little girl, looks just like Keiko. How long can you stay? I'm not sure, but a couple of days. So what, that Sky something? It's Skyfish. Are you going home once you catch it? Yeah. You really haven't seen it? This bat-like thing. Of course not. You can sleep in your room tonight. My room? We've kept it the way it was. SPECIAL JOURNEY REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE Here we go. Thanks. It's hot in this room. Do you want a fan? Yeah. And thanks for bringing this. What is that? It's to catch the Skyfish. What a strange-looking butterfly net. Reminds me of how you'd go with your dad. Huh? To catch bugs. I did? You two went all the time to that shrine. What is it? Are you okay? What's going on? I'm fine. My clothes are scraping a cut I have. Let me see. No, I'm fine, really. Are you sure? So, hey, where's that shrine? It's the one by the beach. Open it a little more. But it'll get away. Hey. You kids. What are you doing? Nothing. Can I see what's in that bag? Huh? Why? That's a Skyfish in there, isn't it? Huh? No way. Who are you? I'm, well... I'm from the Small Animal Conservation Group. He's with the government, this is bad. This shrine. People have seen a Skyfish here. We're in trouble. Well, you can see it, but you can't have it. Skyfish is, well... It's a registered rare animal. So the government has to manage them. This is really bad. Where's your proof? Show us proof that you're from that organization. Hey! He might be an imposter. I have to be sure. I left my ID at the office. I don't have it with me. Then you can't have it. Let's go. Let go of it right now! The Skyfish, it, um... It spits poison from its mouth! It's not something kids can handle! If you touch that poison, it will burn your skin. And your skin, it will burn! Let go of it now! Oh no, we gotta call an ambulance! He'll get burned! What number is the ambulance? It's, um... Google it yourself! Um, an ambulance, it's... Come on, hurry up! His face will get burned! -Hurry! -It's okay. -But the poison... -I'll be fine. But the poison... I, um... I have cream on my face. Cream? Yeah. Safety cream. It nullifies the poison. So I'm okay. Oh, good. How did you guys catch it? We were sitting here, and we saw a strange thing drinking water there. Water? Yeah, it had its head in the water. Then what? We realized it was a Skyfish. So you tried to catch it. We sneaked up on it, but it noticed us. We thought it got away. But then suddenly... It kind of lost control. Yeah, it started flapping in circles. And kind of crashed on the ground. I got it! What time was that? Do you remember? Oh, yeah, the 12:00 bell was ringing. The bell? Thanks. This is classified information, so don't tell anybody, got it? Got it. Thanks. Okay, then. Where's Dad? He's eating out today. Let's eat. Thank you for this food. Thank you for this food. Easy now. Thank you for this food. Are you going out today, too? Yeah, to the shrine. Can you drive your dad to the hospital for his checkup? Why? Dad can drive, can't he? He said he drank till morning. I think he might still be drunk. He hardly ever drinks. What's gotten into him? Want some more? Looking for some bug? It's not a bug. A Skyfish. Why look for it? For work. I'm making a manga based on it. What kind of bug is it? It's super fast. And totally elusive. You drive! Hurry! Come on! What's going on? Just go! I'll explain later. Veer left! Go right, down that road! It's mine for sure. What the... Are you feeling better? Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry for the trouble I caused you. Did you lose weight? Huh? Your face looks different. Does it? Mr. Tagami, hello. Hey, Oda, what's up? I heard you came in, so I ran over. About that project... Later, okay? He's busy. It's okay, tell me now. Can I? I found a really interesting manga artist. That's a really unique style. Yes, and his manga are so great. It's sexual and even abnormal, but has a sharp sense of humor. I wondered if we could ask him to make an original manga for us. His works will definitely be... We don't do originals. Let's do it. I've come up with a storyline, can I run it by you? Sure. I also came up with a story that might be good. So here's the thing. You wake up, and suddenly, your schlong is gone. What do you think?
