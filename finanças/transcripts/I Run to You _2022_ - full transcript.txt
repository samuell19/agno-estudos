RUN TO YOU - Pamela. - Massimo. Massimo! Massimo! That's me, I'm Massimo. Francesco! Francesco! Francesco! That's me, moi. It's me, it's me. - All good? - Hello. In one week you have had too many professions. A French bulldog breeder, a Korean cooking expert, an English diplomat. Yes, I am good. I am a professional, since women end up having as much fun as I do. For example, your wife might like to have fun with an English diplomat. No, stay clear of my wife, Besides, she's not that type. It wasn't trying to offend you. I was just saying. Congratulations on the show. Thank you very much. - High level. - Always. Aren't you tired of making up so many stories? When women call me by another name they drive me crazy. But you have to stop, Gianni. - Why? - Because you are 50 years old. 49. Please. I am still 49 years old. I would like you to try once to conquer a woman for who you really are. And I mean a woman, not a girl of just 20 years. Now what do they want? Yes. Thanks. My mother. You patched things up? How is dear Maria? She's dead. A touch of mustard... just a tad. What's today, general day off? Where the fuck is he? Even recently, despite her difficult condition, she never lost her energy, her zest for life, my mother was like a lioness. Even when we were left alone... I messed up, got caught in a Filipino funeral. My mother never let us lack for anything. Filipinos. It was never easy for her, a single woman with twin sons. Now we'll hear from... To Father Liborio who was a close friend of my mother. And that to close this funeral he will share his personal memories with us. Thanks. Maria was a woman strong as an oak and flexible as a reed. Dad didn't come. - We all remember... - At least he was consistent. She was always ready to give a smile to everyone in need. The keys to mom's house. Maria was a happy woman. You should go get your things. That would have made her happy. ...no problem. At mom's house, I don't have any belongings. She was always open and available with anyone. Yes, yes I will go, are you happy? A woman... full of momentum and passion, similar to tulip bulbs. Or like the great spectacle of going to a movie at night. Good grief. To the trash. Dad. May I? I always have you in... Imagine... That this afternoon I will see you And that tonight... I can't get you out of my head And tonight... Sorry, I came in because the door was open. - Good day. - Good day. I am the new neighbor who is changing next door. I am moving and was looking for someone who could help me move a chair. - No problem. - No, no, no, I can. Don't worry. Listen I do home care for people like you. - For people like me. - Yes. Like you. And now I'm looking for a job. If you think I could help you, I am available. - Thanks. Perfect. - No problem. - What's your name? - Sorry. Alessia. Gianni. Don't worry. Leave it there. I got this. There's no need. I think something fell down there at the bottom, can you pick it up? Oh, yeah. I already saw it. It's a brooch. That's it. Thanks. You should not have bothered. How nice. Do you like sewing? What? No, this belongs to my mom. My mother... Because this was her house. Although she is dead. She died recently. I'm so sorry. Now... I live here. Amid memories. It's hard. It is very difficult. Be strong. That's why I tell you that if you ever need help being here just to order or sew... -Thank you -Cook or whatever, I'll be here. Just knock on my door whenever you want, sir. But please, talk to me without formalities. So when you want, I'll be here. - Alessia. - Gianni. Thanks. And sorry for the inconvenience. It's not a bother at all. See you. - Bye. - Welcome. Thanks. Alessia, my new neighbor has a piece of... Mom, please don't judge me like that, and look who's talking. Father Liborio, huh? And what's this next feat? I sleep with the new neighbor while in the wheelchair. Wow, tougher and tougher. Do you know what I'll do now? I'll buy myself a nice pair of felt-embellished corduroy pants. I don't know why, but it has a certain effect on women. - Like what? - Effect of the Red Cross. Sad. Very sad. Yes. This is for the colonoscopy. - With your 50 years it is necessary... - 49, man. When you train, is your heart rate below 108? - Always below. - Where will the next marathon be? - In Milan. - I don't see any problem, - physically you're in good shape. - Feel awesome. But in the mental aspect I have certain concerns. I have a little question. If you can make this girl want to be with you. How do you plan to do it in a wheelchair? I make myself comfortable. And? Let her do the work. Not bad, eh? You are quite a gallant. - Good day. - Smoke. Smoke, Inpoliti, shrivels your balls. - Good day. - Good day. - Hello. - Good day. I remind you that we do not sell sports shoes. We do not sell any sports shoes. We sell an idea. If I pay 120 to 200 euros for this shoe, it is because I am buying an idea. Clever. Fit... and young. Put it in your head. - What are you talking about? - Colonoscopy. It's Friday at four. - Do not miss it. - Thank you. - Can we talk about that later, Lucy? - Luciana Doubts? Excuse me, don't you think that diversification is something important for our image? For example, in social welfare. Like the Paralympic champions, who in our society are an emblem of struggle and retention, with which young people could connect. Thanks. Finally. Finally, one of you had a concrete idea. An idea... of shit. Without direction and rhetoric. Guys, be honest, who wants someone handicapped to walk in? You have to excuse me, but they are not my clients. Because I do not produce wheels for wheelchairs. Miss, I produce shoes. Shoes are worn, - they get worn... - Worn out. - What? - That are consumed. What you said at the beginning was fine. They wear out! And how many shoes can a disabled person buy in a lifetime? They are not my clients. Excuse me, I find my clients on Instagram with influencers, okay? But on Instagram the Paralympic athletes have many followers. Who do you work for? For a charity group? How...? - How do I know who she is? - Giulia, new, short-term contract. Oh, perfect, short-term, meaning today. Thanks. Good luck. - Now? - Yes. Now, leave. This is a competition. There are no second or third places, it's just us, and we must be first. You must never forget that we battle together, but only one finishes first. Lucy. - Here are the poverty clothes. - Thank you, Lucy. Nope. Lucy, no. Luciana. My name is Luciana. Luciana smacks of proletarian, poor. Wretched! Let's see what we have here. Very old, very ugly. How dismal. Perfect! Perfect. What a nice car. - Look what he's wearin'. - You can't have it all. Nice, eh? All mine. Move your ass if you want to make it in life. Who's he? I have no idea. No? This is my turf. His turf? Have you seen him here before? No. fuck it - Good day. - Good day. Gianni. Alessia. How are you? A little in the dumps. -Am I bothering you -No, absolutely not. - You sure? - I swear. I wanted to see if you'd like to come in for some coffee or a glass of wine. Some company. Right now? - See? I'm bothering you. - No, not at all. - It doesn't bother me. - Really Alessia? I'm going for my keys. - You sure? - Yes. I'm glad I didn't bother you. Wait, wait. I'll be right back. Wait. Where is the coffee? Here are the plates. The cups. Here's the coffee. Next to the artichokes. With cookies? Yes. What do you want it with? - With milk or sugar? - Sugar. With sugar it is perfect. Perfect, damn it. I don't know if there is sugar. Sugar? Where...? Look where she put it. She was diabetic, but... - Everything's fine? I better come help. - Yes. Oh God. I wish I could walk - in order to reach the sugar. - The chair. Now let go. Let go with confidence. - Here's the chair. - The chair! - Sorry. - Don't worry. -Look where he put the sugar -Do you want me to lower it? - In one of these jars. - This one? It's the other. - This one? - Good. I have it. Thank you very much. - Sugarfree. - No, no, I take it bitter. Do you take care of the line? I have to go to Milan for the marathon of... As... as a spectator, and for that... How long have you been working? - Home care? - Yes. Two years ago. And you, what is your job? I'm handicapped, I don't work. Disabled! And it's no excuse to do nothing in life. - I guess it's true. - For example, you can't walk, but it doesn't keep you from looking at my boobs. - No. - Go ahead. - Go ahead. - I watched. But I... Well, you're right. Plus, they're really good. You know that. - Let's yell, "Long live boobs!" - Yes, long live... the boobs. - I'll have more cookies. - Take whatever you want. - Are you married? - No, single. Especially because of my condition. It is difficult to find someone, a person... - special. - Don't worry. There's a market for everyone, I say. I'm not the kind for relationships, -monogamy, marriage -Bravo, bravo. - I just want to have fun. - Yes. - It's my life. - Do you have something planned tonight? - Tonight... - Yes. I will go with my friends to ice skate downtown. It's complicated, right? If I'd known, I'd have mounted snow tires. No, we're all kids. Anyway, thank you very much for the coffee. - I loved coming. - Me too. - Goodbye, Gianni. - Bye - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Thanks. Alessia. I mean... you see me like this, but I'm not... I work for a major company and I own High Speed. Oh, really? I have 148 stores between Italy and the rest of Europe. High Speed. That's me. Good. I also have a villa. Not like this place. I mean, with all due respect. But I'm telling you so you don't think I'm just... this. Are you busy on Sunday? Sunday? No. Would you like lunch with my folks in the country? Do you want to introduce me to your mom and dad after our conversation? I'd like that. Of course. Good. I'm happy. - I can see that. - See you on Sunday. Until Sunday. - Bye. - Bye. - Gianni! - Look at this one. - Gianni. - What's happening? I didn't give him the address of the countryside. Via Tiberina 1547. Via Tiberina 1547. - Bye. - Bye. Is everything fine? - Yes. - Do you want me to come and help you? No, I enjoy the sky because the sun came out in all its splendor. That's true. So beautiful! Give me a hand. Give me a hand. Looks like you can move your ass on your own. - Sunday in the countryside. - I'll be there. Goodbye, Gianni. Thank you so much for helping me. Idiots. There it is. Now... First thing, block this. Here it is. The wheel. Now with patience, the second wheel. Damn whore! It was an expression. Not because of the profession. I did not mean... Imagine... I have nothing against that. Where are you from? From Warsaw? Vladivostok? St. Petersburg? - Porta Furba. - Are you local? I didn't guess because you're blonde. You're second generation, right? Wow, hostile! Ready, let's go. Finally, have a good day. Hostile. It's for growing up in the east. That area hardens you and that's why you show no mercy. From Porta Furba. You had to be from Porta Furba. Don't be prejudiced. There are friendly people in Porta Furba. Why do people go to live in the country? This countryside is torture. I have always hated the countryside. A dog! Momi, down! Drop it, now, Momi. He's a friend. Perfect. You did the whole driveway in your wheelchair? I got some fresh air. It is a beautiful countryside. Those are my nephews. Francesco and Margherita. Say hello to Gianni. Hi kids. Aren't you hot with that? I heard lightning. It's my brother Luigi, my sister-in-law Sara. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, my name is Gianni. - My mother. - Ma'am. - It's a pleasure. - The pleasure is mine. I apologize. The dog lunged at the bouquet Thanks. Don't worry. - I'm Gianni. - Nice to meet you. - My husband Carlo. - I thank you for the welcome. Go ahead, come in. Let's roll into the house. Welcome, go ahead. - Excellent. - But look what a beautiful house. Thanks. It's good that you like it. - Here. - Come closer. - Thanks. - It's my grandmother, Margherita. This is Gianni, the one I told you about. My pleasure. But it's not as old as you described. Alessia told us that you are the next door neighbor. Yes, actually the house belongs to my mother. But with her illness, she... I hope it's nothing serious. She died. Ah, that means it was serious. Better take off your raincoat. Even makes your underwear sweat. I said it makes you hot. - You're right. - Can you give me a hand? Of course. Very well. I'll put it in here. - Do you want some of this? - No. That's aunt Chiara. Hello everyone. - Aunt Chiara! - Hello. Hi Mom. -Hello Dad -Hello. - Hello. - Hello daughter. Here she is. This is my sister, Chiara. This is Gianni, my friend. It's a pleasure. Gianni. My pleasure. And Chiara is not married. She is single. I think you could share your stories. Since you two are di... From Rome! Grandma, my beautiful grandma. - My baby. - Hello. - Did you see I put your earrings on? - It's ready. Time to eat. - I need space. - I will move the flowers. Thanks. Here it is. Children, to eat. They set you up. You had your sights on the girl but you get the paralytic. No. Okay. Sit down. I don't like blind dates either. But since we're here, what's your job? I sell shoes. Do you know the store, High Speed? - Of course. - That's the one. The multibrand is mine. I know it because I love shoes and I love shopping. Well now that there is the convenience of shopping online. No, no... I love to go shopping, to see the accessories, buy them and leave full of bags, "Pretty Woman" style. - You do sports? - No. Why not? - No... - I think sport is important in life. I play tennis, but it's not my job. I'm a musician. I play the violin. Do you like classic music? Well, classical music... It's kind of boring. Well, a little bit, really. It must be very difficult, right? To play the violin. Yes, but I started when I was very young. Incredible. What a joy. Almost a disgrace. Totally. She was in a wheelchair, the grandmother with an oxygen tank. And the brother, frankly, seemed a bit slow. - And what did you do? - What do you think? I stood up, excusing myself. This does not work. I am interested in the other one. The healthy sister. That is all. How is she? She looks delicious. Perfect. I mean, the other one, the older sister. - Disabled, how do you think? - I understand. But I ask you as a person, interesting, funny? What does it matter as a person? But is she hot, yes or no? She is a good woman. That's true. She is pretty. So why don't you try it? They will crack their wheelchairs to flirt. Gianni, it's impossible, even for you. No. What do you want to bet? Good day. - Good day. - Sorry. I was looking for Gianni. He forgot this. He's not here. I'm his brother. Oh, very good. Twin. Fraternal, very. - Different. - Very much. It's just that when I saw the wheelchair, I thought... Do you want to come in? Yes, thanks. So I can leave him this. Your brother is an exceptional man. He really is. Desire for liberation, will power. He never stops! A thousand things. He told me about the sewerage project in Botswana. Besides, every weekend, he goes to buy croquettes to feed the street dogs. He is a beautiful person. I don't want him to be offended because I introduced him to my sister. No, Gianni is not the type to be offended if someone introduces him to his sister. She is disabled. He has a similar situation. So... What I believe is that if they share experiences, they could be a couple. I don't know. And tell me. How exactly was the event? The event... Road accident? I don't know. Yes. - Is he para... - Para... - ...plegic? - ...plegic. Yes. Although not so much. Only a little. Couldn't it be a transfer? I haven't written a check since 1996. To whom? Rest in Peace LLC. But I'll pay my own quota. But what are you going to pay? Don't be ridiculous. But they could have billed me. I even gave them a credible reference: An emotional shower. Here it is. Do you at least like it? I chose the pink marble that mom liked. It's a tomb. Tell them to finish it as soon as possible, with what it cost. And no deductions. So you've experienced a miracle? I say this because you are no longer in a wheelchair and you walk. What will you do this morning? Will you go feed the poor stray dogs or will you work for the Botswana Project? Despite reaching the age of 50, - you keep spreading your shit. - 49. And I still have hair on my head. Think how bad nature has been to you. Voice mail service. After you hear the beep, please leave your message. Hi Chiara, I'm Gianni. Remember me? Listen, I was thinking that... Do you want to go out on Saturday? We could take a walk... I mean, go around a little, we can have a drink and sit somewhere... Well, we're always sitting. Anyway, if you like the idea... let me know. Bye. Bye. Fuck, can't say a thing! Stresses a guy out. But what the hell. I remind you that tomorrow you have an appointment with the director of the south center at 2:00 p.m. And I remind you that we just bought this for you to give me these types of messages, so use it. Yes, okay. There is a person outside. No, I don't have any appointments for today. But I can't kick her out. And why can't you kick her out? Because she is disabled. It would be a lot, wouldn't it? May I? Good day. Good day. - Good day. - Good day. Thanks. I received your message. Unfortunately, I can't on Saturday, but I'm in a tournament nearby, so I thought I'd say hello. I looked online for your store and saw your address. Why did they sit you at the desk? No... It's just that... You are embarrassed. Here at your work, with clients. I get it. I also can't stand that look of compassion so that later they pretend as if we weren't different. There are, we're not the same! That's a fact. But the chair is our best friend. And we shouldn't be ashamed of it. Because... - Can you come for a moment? - No, tell me. - No, come in here. - No, you come. - No, you. - Luciana, please! Okay. As you like. Okay. I'm leaving. As I told you, I have this tournament. You should go, and then we'll have a drink. What time? At 7, at the Colombo Sports Center. Do you know it? Yes of course. In fact, we had tried to sponsor it as it was an important initiative in which we focused on being socially aware. Really? No, this advertising is already somewhat old. In short, today's athletes with disabilities are an emblem for young people. Besides, I can understand it. I'm sorry, but this can't wait. You have to give me an answer for your colonoscopy. Because it has been changed. Not the procedure, it's always through the anus. You know? But they changed the day. Is it okay with you to have the date for Thursday? It's okay. It's okay, Luciana. Thanks. I better go. I'll leave you with your internal problems. No, you have to do it as a precaution. Bye. Chiara. Two things. The first is that I have to tell you that I started to like blind dates. - And the second? - You look like a track champion. See you later. Lucy. - Yes, hello? - I need a wheelchair. A wheelchair? Meaning? A chair with wheels. For disabled. By 6:30. - Where do I look for it? - You must have a disabled friend. An old woman. Steal one! What a bastard! Take your finger off the button, I'm listening. I hate this device. I hate it. Welcome to the National Final of the LAB 3.11 circuit. Entering the field, Chiara Vitale, number five in the national ranking. And Giulia Capocci, number one in the national ranking. All busted up, damn it Lucy! With everything I pay you, you should have bought it new. You played very well, Chiara. I know. Gianni! - Gianni! Bye. - Bye. - Hello. - You came. You were fantastic. And it also looked like a real game. Congratulations. Thanks. You are sitting in my chair. Oh, excuse me. I'm really sorry. It's just that the degree of stupidity that... That exists in the streets of this city. It's just that I was rolling, - and then I stepped... - A poo? Excrement! That is a misfortune. It is a classic on the street. So I had it washed and I sat here, so... - Don't worry. - I didn't know it was your chair. Tomorrow I'll pick her up at your office. No, no, nothing like that. I'll have Luciana take it to your house. Listen, um... how about a drink together? Gladly. I'm with some friends. How does your sports federation work? That is, can someone who is in a wheelchair play against someone with one leg, with a carbon leg, for example? Who is the one who decides who plays against whom? Who decides that someone in a wheelchair will play with someone in a wheelchair? Or if he's missing an arm, will he play with someone without an arm? - Or is there a possibility of mixing... - Gianni, we already got it. I play basketball. But... don't you do sports? - No I don't... - Bad very bad. - I rehearse theater. - It's good for morale. I play volleyball. Your body needs to feel that you still respect it. In winter I go skiing. And above all, you should not belittle him in such a way. I practice singing recitation and contemporary dance. - Are you embarrassed? - Don't give a damn about people! You have to accept yourself for who you are. I play football. - Hello. - Hello. Good day. I'm Luciana, the assistant... - Of Gianni. - Yes. Perfect. Come in. Thanks. Please. - Thanks. - Can you put it there? - Here? - Yes, thanks. Listen... Gianni thanks you very much for the chair. - And these are for you. - Beautiful! And he asked me to tell you that he was impressed by your match... Sit down. and that he has already recovered his wheelchair for his disability. That he said. He says, you know. You are beautiful. This compliment is also part of the message? No, that's me, although I know he agrees with me because he likes beautiful women. - He pursues them all. - Have you ever given in? Are you nuts? No! - Because he's in a wheelchair? - Who? - Gianni. - Oh yeah. No, it's not that. - It's another reason. - But it doesn't sound so bad. He is a handsome man with a good position. You might have a chance. Are you saying that because I'm in a wheelchair too? No, no, no, I'm not saying that. I say this because you look strong, optimistic. And for love, that works, right? For a woman like you, optimism is having love last as long as possible. For me, hoping it arrives. Here it is. Lucy, get me a ticket for the concert on the 12th at the Turin Regal Theater. Royal. It could be in the box or the best seat you can find. - Classical music, sure? - Why not? Because the last ticket you asked me for was for a pop band reunion. It's all I need, Lucy, thank you. What you're doing is not good at all. This woman is not stupid. - It's just a surprise. - Oh yeah? Then go on your own two feet. Surprise her by standing on those nice, shapely legs. 100 euros. I give you 100 euros, you get it back in two hours. 100 euros is a good deal. 300. Okay. 150 because you're nice. - 300. - Hey, all you say is three hundred, say two hundred. - 300. - You're a... 300. Here, 300 euros. Here. What's the man's name? - Propsero. - Propsero! Do you want to take a walk? What do you say? Give me a hand. Good. So... Give me a hand with Prospero. Take Prospero, careful, don't drop him. Come on, come on. There! Prospero, live it up! Yes. See you in a couple of hours. How does this work? If I press here... Prospero, he will pay for the drink. Sorry. Ma'am, may I borrow those? Thanks. Chiara. Congratulations. You were phenomenal, I assure you. - It has been a pleasure. - Thank you very much. - Beautiful concert. - Congratulations. Totally. It was awesome. Let's go eat something at the pizzeria. - Are you coming? - Yes, I'll be there, see you later. Bye. I'm coming. What are you doing here? I was nearby, I typed in “Concerts in Turin” and here I am! It has been a beautiful concert. - Thank you very much. - I swear. Want to join us? No. You're coming to dinner with me tonight. In a restaurant worthy of you. Listen. Let's go another time to the pizzeria. Okay. Is it new, the chair? No, it's from Prospero. He is an old colleague of mine. Good evening. Welcome. -Thank you very much -Welcome ma'am. - Go ahead. - Thanks. Chiara, I have to tell you something. I have lied to you. It's not true that I... I was around here, I came here to see you. We must not tell lies. Ma'am, may I? Yes. Excuse me. Bon Appétit. - Thanks. - Thanks. Why do we toast? I have it. I have it! For the lie. -Forgive me, ma'am -Be careful. You have to excuse me, if I touch this button, it moves without warning. It was an accident. Forgive me. It is very sensitive. I am sorry. What a mess. It was an accident. Listen, I'm sorry. I do understand something about you. You're unstable. You change chairs every day. And you are beautiful. Thanks. Your shoulders bared... My butt's not bad either. But no one ever sees it. - When do you leave? - Tomorrow. - What flight? - No, I'll go by bus. - How long do you take? - Seven hours. Seven hours! I could never sit that long! This was my mother's favorite song. Alessia told me that your mom passed away recently. - I'm sorry. - But don't worry. We didn't have a good relationship. I hadn't seen her for years. Why's that? When my parents separated, my brother and I had to choose a side. What side did you choose? Mine. So for my mother, I became an enemy. For my father, a coward. And for my brother, a jerk. Why do we have to be talking about such sad things when we were talking about an interesting topic? Which? Your butt. Gianni. It's because I need to call the waiter. In our condition it's not easy. So I'll call until the young man arrives. Wait. -Give them to me -Thanks. I like taking my shoes off, as if I'd been dancing all night. See? It's useful to be unstable sometimes. - Yes. - You belittled my chair so much! - Here we are. - This is it? Yes. Thanks for the ride. Here we are. One last drink in your room? Yes. Alright. Thanks. Goodnight. - Good day. - He's right, it's day. I'll go ahead, okay? The number, Chiara. - 508, 5th floor. - 508. - We got stuck. - Sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me, but tomorrow... I have to leave early. Are you sure? Yes. Really, really sure? - Goodnight. - Thanks. Thanks. - Hello. - Hello. Good day. Nice to meet you, Roberto. - Pleasure. - What kilometer are you on? - Second or third. - Second kilometer only? At what time did you wake up? Late, I was in bed. Were you in bed? Do you like to be in bed? But technically, can a handicapped man... Yes, Gianni, technically he can have an erection. It's like a reflex. But I don't see your worry, since you're a fake paraplegic. Ask yourself what she feels, it might be more interesting. - What do you think? - Well, the possibilities are endless. - Infinite? - Yes. It depends on the level of the spinal cord injury. But how do you know all this? Because I know you, Gianni. I knew we'd have this conversation sooner or later. - It's because you love me. - That's the problem. - Want some advice? - Okay. This bet is crap, forget it. - Why? - Just because. Because you are 49 years old. See? I push enough... How old am I? 49. - Gianni. - Hello Chiara. Hello. - What is it? - I just wanted to listen to you. Am I interrupting you? No, I'm not helping myself to a plate of pasta. By the way Chiara. Would you like to have dinner some night off? - Yes, it sounds great. - Like tomorrow? Perfect. - I send you my address. - Yes! Yes. Thanks. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Bye. Bye. - Hello, Roberto. - Am I late? A little. I guess there must be a way for you to forgive me. I'd say so. So, this dinner? Happy? Yes. Yes, happy, but...? No "ifs" or "buts". It's just that he looks at me as if he were looking at a woman. And that hadn't happened for a long time. Good for Gianni. So, you like him. Yes. Why didn't you put out for him? I don't know. Poor thing! You like him, trust me, I know. I like him because he makes me feel... whole. - I am a genius. - Why? Admit I have a good eye. We'll see. With time. - It irks me. - What does? I can find boyfriends for others, but for myself... Nothing at all. Hello. Hello. - Come in. - Thanks. - I brought you this. - Thanks. Although you shouldn't have bothered. Bubbly, excellent! Your house is beautiful. - You like it? - Yes. Go on in. It's beautiful! You know, when you give an architect free reign... No toast? Follow me. Follow me. Can we talk about it? - About what? - About what happened to us. Why we can't walk. Come on, you start. Well, I... I had an accident. Superman. Maybe you know him. Christopher Reeve, fell off a horse, you know. - No. - Yes. You were luckier, he was blocked from here down. Yeah, but I fell off a low horse. It was a... A pony Essentially a mule. Despite that... It's nice you find the irony. - What else is there? - I like that. Won't you ask me? - If you don't want to... - I do. You told me your story and I want to tell you mine. I crossed an intersection on the highway. The car flipped over four times. The other guy broke his collarbone, I lost my legs. The violin, on the seat next to me, was intact. Amazing, right? Did you feel good? Yes. Very. Here. And you? Me too. Here... National Monument. - And you took a picture! - A genius. - How did you do it? - How did I do it... - Give it to me. - Dude, it looks great. - Doesn't even look handicapped. - Are you screwing us? - Tell us. - I'm not screwing you. Don't make me be vulgar. How did it go? It went fine, how else? - What happened? - Oh my God. I'm sorry, but I'm very clumsy with my hands. I'm dropping things like I'm handicapped. Are you angry? I'll buy you another one! Get dressed. What do you need? Luciana, call that girl... the Salvation Army, the new one? - Giulia? - Giulia. She doesn't work here anymore, you fired her. - Me? - Yes, in front of everyone in the meeting. Can't say a fucking thing around here! Luciana, I admire your work a lot, but... But you don't seem to understand a little irony with a sense of humor. - Call her over, please. - I'll do it. How is Chiara, the violinist? I don't know. I haven't heard from her. And you already told her that you're not an invalid? Disabled. No. I have not had time. Might find 5 minutes today, schedule's light. Running away? The escape master. - Hello? - Hello. It's good to hear you. Forgive me. I've been away for work. I've been busy too, with rehearsals. How are you going with that? Well, well. It's weird. It seems that you are walking. Me? No. Why do you say that? No, no. It seemed as if you were walking. No, imagine that now I'm... I'm sitting. Sitting as usual in my chair. Listen, I called you because... I would like to see you to tell you something important. Hello. Hello. Welcome, come in. I'm finishing. I just need to rehearse a score. Come in. Done. Now I am all yours. I see you have learned. Have you thought about me these days? A lot. What did you want to tell me? Does your grandmother also play the violin? Yes. It's practically his fault. When I was little, she always took me to the orchestra pit. She's my best friend. She's tough! Think that when my ex-boyfriend decided to break up with me, she broke all the windows in his car. - 3000 euros in damages. - Right! Good for grandma! And when did he leave you? After the accident. What a bastard. But I understand it. It's normal. That changed everything between us. But... He was cheating on me with another and he didn't tell me the truth. That's what hurt me, the fact that he lied to me. There is one thing I can't stand. People who lie. Come on. Let the record show I was against this dinner. He threatened to fire me and that's why I fell for it. Exaggerated. It's very embarrassing. It's too much. Listen, she wanted to meet my friends and I couldn't think of anything else. Also, you are the only ones who are aware of what is happening. Wow, what luck! I don't know what's happening to me. I'm young, got a great body. I still have hair on my head. - Maybe you're in love. - Knock it off! It can happen to anyone, even you. Laugh. Anyway, I'll tell her. I'll find the right place, the right time, and I'll tell her. I'm warning you, either you tell her or I tell her. If not, I will. Good evening. They're singing? Sounds like it. Good evening. - This way, need help? - No, thanks. What is this place? - Chiara, your friends. - Thank you, Mauro. - Hi! - Hi! - This is Dario. - Chiara. - A pleasure. - You already know Luciana. - Yes, I already know her. - Hello. - Your coats. - Thanks. Help me with my coat. Thanks. Thanks. - It's a karaoke. - Yes. Thanks, bye. Excuse me, but I love karaoke. - Excuse me. - Where are you going? She's very good. Looks like it. - "Baby"? - "Baby. I didn't know this hidden side of yours. I'm not the only one who has one, no? No. Chiara, I have to tell you something. Oh, God. The soy sauce! It all fell off. - Do I help you. - No, no, no. Don't worry, this is already stained, rather. -Good -Dario... - Yes? - Come with me to the bathroom. - Of course. - I am sorry. - But the sauce... - Yes, sometimes it happens. Slow, slow. Look, I know her and she's not ready. If I tell her right now, she won't accept it. That's not fair. She'll never accept it anymore, Gianni. Listen, she's fine, but I know her better than you. You're like a twelve-year-old. Whatever you say. You're right, happy? We meet again. If you want me to give you a hand... My grandfather doesn't walk either. That's why I have experience. No, thanks. I'll take care of it. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes, thank you. Hello. Hello. - They're for you. - For me? Thanks. Come in. - Hello. - Hello, hello. How are you, Alessia? Yeah, he's disabled and I hit him, I love it! - It relaxes me! - It's all okay. All in order. Listen to me well, shoe merchant. Now you will go to my sister and tell her the truth. You will tell her that you walk, that you are a charlatan and that you do not love her. And above all, you will tell him that you are a piece of shit. You have two days. Alessia. Alessia! Alessia. I tried to tell her, but it's not easy. And, in two days, I don't know... Don't you think you could tell her? I'm sure you'll find the best way to tell her. Know something? The disabled person is you. I say you don't love her, you pity her, without the wheelchair you'd never have looked at her! No, Dad, it's nothing to do with pity. She is much braver than me, much stronger, and I feel like a shithead. You are a shithead. Thanks Dad. It's always a pleasure to see you. So tell her the truth. If I tell her the truth now... I'll lose her. Consider this, Gianni. can you live with just one woman your whole life? You're right. You and me are the same. No, of course we're not the same. Look, you are a man with many women. And I am an old man. With many women. So I'm a lonely old man. Losing your beautiful mother was the stupidest thing I could do in my life. Then why didn't you go to his funeral? I'm sorry. Sorry for the interruption, but we have to close the registrations for the trip to Lourdes on Saturday. And Father Paolo is asking us for the names of the participants. So if you want to join, come this way, please. Leave him. Can I say it? It's just that I feel like he's not good for you. Anyway, you don't need him. - I don't need anyone. - Obviously! - But... - It's him. Gianni. - How are you? - Well, and you? Do you want to accompany me to Lourdes? - When? - Morning. - Morning? - By bus. By bus. I'm not sure. - I'll think about it. - I would like us to talk. - I understand, it's important to you. - Yes, it is. Okay. - So you'll go? - Yes. Yes. - I already said yes. - Perfect, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. - What? - He wants to go to Lourdes. To Lourdes? Miss. - Is the size right? - Yes, but I'd like another color. - I'll bring it. - Thanks. I don't see what he hopes to find in Lourdes. A miracle. A miracle? Alessia. Gianni walks. Like you, her, all of you. He has never been disabled. - But... - None of your looks. You know. I know you well when you make that face. Either you're up to something crazy or you feel guilty. How do you know he's not disabled? Because I am disabled. But I decided to pretend I didn't notice. I didn't talk about it with anyone to give myself a moment of happiness. In exchange for a lie. Because it's good to feel loved. Or at least believe. You have to take advantage of the beautiful moments that you find. Life is unique. The only other color we have is this. Want to try it? Please. Sounds crazy to me, honestly. I remind you that you introduced him to me. Yes. And a gift should never be refused. - Better, huh? - How long have you known? Enough to get used to it. And why didn't you tell me? Because you would have stopped me. I know it's crazy. I wanted to see how far he'd go and I couldn't believe it. I know the worst will be when it's over. When you can't keep pretending to believe it. What will you do when he tells you? What can I do? I'll say goodbye. Excuse me, it's just... it's a very sad story. So sorry. Jesus is passing by right now Jesus is passing by right now And when He passes everything changes Sadness goes away and joy arrives And when he passes, everything is transformed Joy arrives, the heart is happy And when He passes everything changes How long from Toulouse to Lourdes? How long from Toulouse to Lourdes? An hour and a half, I think. Sister, enough, enough with your tambourine. - Who is it who reigns? - Jesus reigns. - Who is it who loves me? - Jesus loves me. Enough is enough, I can't stand one more song. Lady, enough I can't stand the infamous sound of this tambourine. - Luciana. - It breaks my head... and the ovaries. And when He passes everything changes Joy arrives, the heart is happy What do we do now? Let's ask someone. Let's follow the flow. - Let's ask. - Let's ask. Let's ask here, in this business. - With this man? - Yes. - Bonjour, señor, excuse me. - Hello. Yes, olé. Where is the Maison Del Miracle? Italians? How did you guess? In the main square, there you will see a meeting point. There's Father Walter. He is Italian. - Merci. - Merci. - Au revoir. - Thanks. - Nice store. - Merci. Welcome. This is Walter. In Lourdes, the simplicity of prayer creates a need for fraternal communion. Here, diversities are torn down. Here one can abandon oneself before the loving gaze of Our Lady in order to ask for consolation. You. Follow me - Me? - Yes, yes. - You. - You. Nurse. Wait there. Nurse to you. Fix yourself. What a disgrace. If you get up from that chair now, you'll lie again. You are not paralyzed. People go home from Lourdes with a picture of the grotto, an image of St. Bernadette, a vial of holy water, but rarely on his own legs. At least since I've been here. Maybe I bring bad fortune. Now, I think the most important thing for people who come here is that they come with all their faith. And when they leave... They leave with a desire, to return here and believe again. Do not extinguish the hope in their hearts. Do not make any gesture that disappoints or hurts them. Now I'll let you follow your conscience. Also, understand that if you get up we will take pictures of you. Like I told you... Miracles rarely happen. How did you know I don't have a disability? Because I know them. The real ones. You walk in those shoes. Gerome. Give me a cigarette. It was mine. I'll wait for you on the bus. Gia... Gianni! You walk! It's a miracle! It's a miracle, he walks! Come on. Let me see how you walk, Gianni. Gianni. Can I go with you? Great. Merci. Fabio! Where is everybody? No, no, no! Hi Mom. No... Nothing, just that... I made one of my usual messes. I met this girl and... No, a woman. She is a beautiful woman. Beautiful. She does loads of things. She plays tennis and plays the violin too. In love? I don't know. I like her. That is all. I wish I could have introduced you to her. I wasted so much time with you. Forgive me. Have you finished, sir? - I'm sorry, yes. - Thanks. I was talking to my mom. Yes, yes. Can you hold the lady, please? Thanks. - Will it take long? - No, just two minutes. I'll wait. They're all waiting in there. What? The presentation in the meeting room. Yes. Have you seen your e-mail? Wait. Don't go. Open it. No. You have not seen your e-mail. It's a karaoke. It's good. It has a playlist from the '80s, including "Like a Virgin." - It's to thank you. - I'm leaving. That was the e-mail. I already sent my resignation with a copy to Human Resources. It's not like you say. It's not possible to cross the finish line alone. We had a growth of 0.2%, which, being a winter figure, does not appear bad at all. So I congratulate you and as you already know, we have worked... in the new campaign, which I will now show to you. Wait. Giulia. Come here. #RUNTOYOU I thought you were taller. She does not answer the phone. Because she is an intelligent woman. She knows how men like you are. It busts your balls to have the sick around, the disabled. You're in shape, young. Look, I'm 50 years old and I have never felt so old. Yeah? Oh, please! It's not the age. I used to think it was like that until I got... - The colonoscopy. - Please stop. Please, no details, no! What is the worst thing that could happen to me at 50? My hair would fall out. That... I couldn't get it up, I would lose the vigor that I used to have and I would have a belly. But I knew this and I prepared myself by exercising. The gym, a transplant... The Viagra. Sometimes. But this... I was not prepared for this. I can't sleep. Where is she? What is she doing? Who is she with? I want to talk to her, I'm going to behave, I want to contain her, hold her, hug her and talk to her all night, because I've never met a woman like that... I'm sorry. I think you have to go now. Madam, excuse me. I'm going to clean up right away. Run, right now. - I shouldn't have come to bother her. - No, you don't get me. You try my patience, they've had plenty with you. I don't have any. You should go to State Highway 675 at the Orte exit. Hurry up. They will play tonight at the Menotti theater in Spoleto. If you leave now, you'll catch up with them on the Narni ladder. Thanks. If you make her suffer... Those legs, I'll cut them off completely And that's how you'll actually end up in a wheelchair. Sorry. I know what I am. You can call me disabled, differently abled, person with reduced lower-limb mobility, or handicapped. But I know I don't need anyone. I especially don't need a person like you. Can we go? Please forgive me. Can we go? What are you doing here? Nothing. I was passing by and... I searched the internet for running trails in Rome. And that's why I came. Are you going to give up? Come on. -Congrats old man -Look who's talking. - Speech! - Nope! To hell with the speech! - Let's Dance. - Let's Dance! RUN TO YOU.
