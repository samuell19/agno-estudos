We guys in the old society are living in poverty At that time, we saw nothing And we couldn't say anything In these years, the Party anoints my eyes. I can not only see the island and my homeland, but also the world In these years We militia in Tongxin Island are growing up with the care of Mao Zedong Thought We keep going in the wave of the class struggle Today, We are living in happy socialist times However, We will never forget the misery of the past Old Li, what's going on?

Something bad may happen Really? Go When someone goes to sea at that time, his family will never predict the risk that he may encounter And the sailing this time is more worried No one speaks a single word But they know what they think each other There is no need to come to Tongxin Island The fishermen in Tongxin Island are suffering from misery There are three killing axes over their heads Fishing despots, pirates and storms... and storms...

Send him to the district tomorrow Let them deal with him Something bad has happened! A gang of pirates has rescued him Go, go Chen Zhan'ao has escaped Reactionist landlord-bourgeoisie is dreaming to revive anytime A few years have gone by I have grown up in the wave of class-struggle In order to defend our homeland and socialist system, We must pick up our guns Militia-platoon leader Li Haixia Here After the recovery Instructor Fang has been transferred here to be a secretary of commission of our area Wu Caizhu Here Zhao Erman Aunt A'hong is calling your name Zhao Erman Here She is too happy Yu Haihua Here Yang Hailian Here Yuxiu, let's go You are not a militia What are you looking at? Huang Yunxiang Here Mum, Dad have come back from the sea Call you back Go, go, go Chen Ermeng Here Dad, my mum won't come back Dad, you should put more water into the rice You know what!? Hurry up Dad, is there the smell of burnt rice? What should we do? Carry away the fire quickly Gosh, eat your popcorn then What are you doing? A'hong! It's your fault A'sha's mom, A'sha is finding you You are stuck in an embarrassing situation I can't get blamed by women Nonsense Are there any women in your eyes? Damnit, another woman comes again The women have been liberated now We are afraid of them! You never reason with others How come?! You'd better reason with others You went uphill to open up some land You went to the field to fertilize a few times I went to sea You have never taken care of two children I went to sea I wash clothes, gather firewood, make meals and feed the pig... Which ones you have done before? I... I went to sea The sea... the sea... You can't always threaten me by SEA Aunt stands guard and sentry, learn to read and write, is busy with plowing She does her best with the public affairs and housework Does she do her best? I have no meal to eat when I come back While she is talking jokes aside Today we handed out the guns to the female militia You should be happy withs your wife She was just being a little late While you were so angry with her The female militia are superfluous How can a woman become a soldier?! You still have such a viewpoint Let me ask you You male militia go out to sea for a few months Who will protect the island? What should we do if the enemies invade? You are not omnipotent You may switch with your wife You may do housework at home for a few days You think that I can't handle it? Want popcorn then? Don't show off then Let's go and say sorry Hurry up Take it, take it Let's go We have won our struggle I sent him home like that He looks like a captive Grandpa I have finished studying I have finished studying Grandpa, let me then Sister Haixia What's going on? Don't you see? You are a platoon leader now, and forget me I celebrated my birthday yesterday You are already 16 years old You can join a militia Let me help you to enroll My mum doesn't agree at all You should talk with her quickly Grandpa, you eat first My affair is up to you As an old saying goes: The power of a boat focuses on the sail The power of a man focuses on the heart You should have determination Of course I have Aya, snake! You! Sister Haixia Aunt Dacheng, the kid has grown up You should look after her carefully You may not hear about that Such a girl wanders and plays outside all day long Something bad may happen Xiao Minfu has brought the goods here I have brought what you want Look, thanks so much Who puts these boots here? Don't move, don't move You are so clever It is you that let us make the best use of our time to practice Where's the capture I brought to you I have let him go How come a capture? Aunt Dacheng, have you had a meal yet? Not yet Yuxiu this kid becomes naughtier and naughtier Seeing you guys carrying guns, She is so jealous of you She hasn't cut the firewood any more I don't know where she goes from the early morning Aunt Dacheng, I want to discuss with you Talk then Yuxiu is 16 years old now She should join a militia We are out of date, we won't become a militia Is joining a militia purely voluntary? Yuxiu wants to get involved with it My Yuxiu is a timid girl, being afraid of mice Without your provocation she will never think about that Joinga militia is not a bad thing I don't care I won't let Yuxiu join a militia Aunt Dacheng, you may consider it Such a girl wanders outside all day long She is being laughed at by others Sister Haixia, does mum agree? No, she doesn't Talk about it later Aunt Dacheng, what's going on? She doesn't lag far behind either Why is she against Yuxiu to joining a militia? Obviously, joining a female militia is not an easy task I insist joining a militia Go, let me go again Where did you go in the early morning? It is me that called Sister Haixia to come here It is me that insists on coming now If you want to come, come then I haven't owed you either Aunt Dacheng, you didn't owe me But do you still remember how Chen Zhan'ao pressed for our repayment of debts? He obviously exploited our hard work and money But he claimed that we owed him money and foodstuff On a Spring Festival's Eve in order to dodge payment of debts, Uncle Dacheng hid in a wrecked boat As a result, he froze to death If no one saw him and took him back, he may die Here comes liberation our days become better and better But we mustn't forget that Chen Zhan'ao, KMT and Chiang Kai-shek are still here Isn't Uncle Dacheng's fishing boat was sunk by Chiang's bandit gunboat? We couldn't imagine that after a few day when Uncle Dacheng turned over he just... You take good care of mum first Sister Haixia, mum has agreed Don't be so happy I think that someone has said something bad about you to mum Yuxiu, our brains carry a gun Otherwise, the real guns in our hands are useless Rest What's up, Caizhu To aim, or not to aim that's useless You should practice more Or how can you shoot the target? I have confidence to shoot the target Otherwise, the gun has been broken Just aim and aim... So boring! What's going on? Why don't hold up an umbrella? Don't get burnt by the sun Too delicate to be in a militia So what! Caizhu She is like a piece of tofu which fell into the ashtray It can't be blown or beat How can a militia be like that? Disregarded organizational discipline just like a civilian Right. She is so delicate That's right. Being in a militia isn't for fun and is not for showing off How can we go and fight without hard practice? What we carry are guns, not pokers Without discipline how can the militia fight? Being afraid of the wind and the sun, how can a militia be so? The male militia is stronger They ignored us That's right We aren't up to expectations Is that right? You see that she comes and goes at will during training That's nonsense We should criticize her in the meeting Oh, she's coming Guns were carried by Chen Zhan'ao in the past And today Chairman Mao gave us the gun That's the trust! Caizhu, we are revolutionary fighters We should be strict with ourselves Come here We are going on study today Let me say first I am wrong today I hope that you can help me more I must heighten my sense of discipline in the future At the seaside, on the beach, The banians rustle in the wind Fisher girls are at the seaside They are knitting the fishnet Fisher girls are at the seaside They are knitting the fishnet At the foothill, near the cliff appear the large waves Fisher girls are at the seaside They are practicing with knives and guns Fisher girls are at the seaside They are practicing with knives and guns 28 circle has been hit After all, they shot better Personally, We will be absolutely defeated by them What's up? Too scared to go to the battle field? How can you defeat the enemies Old fang, don?t look down on us It depends on you The male militia can hit 25.6 circles on average Let see how the female militia can shoot Female Militia, fire! Cheer them up OK Don't be afraid shoot them Gather together! Comrades! We are not to compete with each other by the shooting match We just want to test your shooting level Defend the island and the homeland The targets are our enemies We should shoot them down with hatred Shoot them accurately Understood Zhao Erman Here Shoot Understood Mum, shoot them down Cheer up! Cheer up! What are you doing? You still add water?! How many circles then? Why not report the shooting result? What's going on? In my opinion It's good enough that they hit the ball When you come home, there's no need to make a meal Just eat the cakes Ignore them Why don't you report the shooting result? I can't find it Where are you looking? Isn't here? I thought it's good enough for me to hit the edge So I never stare the middle 3 hits,3 bingo 29 circles at total Wow, mum is better than dad That's good Wu Caizhu Here Shoot Understood Aunt A'hong has defeated A'hong And A'hong has left angrily 27 circles have been shot A'hong! Come back! Now it's time for Li Haixia the platoon leader to give a shooting performance That's good See? Mum has come back Hurry up Aunt, don?t be softhearted I'm not afraid of him Dad has killed and cooked a chicken for mum What about your dad? Bro. A'hong you are a male chauvinist When did you killed You should tell us You think that I appreciated your aunt's services? What I want her to do is to know her shooting experience You want to bribe me? Don't let him drink He will go to sea tomorrow It's just a farewell dinner You always put in a good word for him If he bullies you later, I will ignore then Don't leave Bad girl, let?s eat together Don't forget to take the cigarette I sent them for you We will make a long-time sail It's vital for you female militia to protect the island Don't worry OK You should catch fish more carefully Let's go Uncle Shuanghe, this is our village chief Village chief He took our ferry to come here Tongxin Village Government appointed Liu A'tai to your village to find her younger sister whowas lost for 35 years We hope that you can help Liu A'tai Weigan 35 years... That's impossible My younger sister had been sold to this island to be a wife when she was 6 years old Why do you mean to find her now? Our homeland was in chaos before the liberation And I heard that there is a pirate called Heifeng near here Now I dare to come Maybe that one is Aunt Dacheng? You are right She looks like Aunt Dacheng That's good, Village chief Can I go to recognise her? OK Xiaoyuan, take him to have a look OK Let me go OK Let's go What are your family's job? Fishermen I went to sea when I was 12 years old And your leg... I carried the stretcher during the liberation I was bombed by the KMT's battle fighter aircraft How did you make a living these years? I have skill I can cut hair Is it a store? Yes I want to buy cigarettes Here you are I want to buy cigarettes, Haifeng brand You are not a local, right? Yes I came here to find my relatives You know Aunt Dacheng? Sister, I am your Brother - A'tai! Where did you come from? It's the guilt of the Old Society Relatives can't know each other When you were 6 years old, Mum and dad sold you to this island I dragged them and cried I said: "You can sell me, instead of sister" But at that time Dad and mum were in a dilemma Sister A'cha A'cha Don't mention the misery Come in then You may have a talk I have to go now Thanks so much Let's go in What's written in the letter is clear And you have found the right person Why do you have to recognize? Here is our guardian coastal line He came here for a few days We have to ask more clearly Personally, we had better write a letter We have to go to Huijiang County to have an investigation OK, let Xiaoyuan write then Xiaoyuan, write a letter OK, put it here Uncle Shuanghe, I want to talk about the work of militia with you now The work of militia... You female militia platoon did a good job You set a good example in the production No. I talked about the training of militia with you last time You have to arrange the time for us Ah! We are busy in production Talk about it later Uncle Shuanghe, you always put things off tomorrow We have not only produce, but also do the military training Frankly speaking, When the enemies invade, he won't come Since he comes, he will depend on PLA As you said, Is the militia useless? Come on, you should have a visionary sight You see Dongsha Island is on our right side And Banping Island is on our left side And we are on Tongxin Island It has become the tiger's tongue The pearl in the dragon's mouth How dare the enemies invade! Haixia, our major mission is to produce We should let Tongxin Island be a land of fish and rice Let's make it a garden on the sea Uncle Shuanghe, I remembered that General Secretary Fang handed me a map That was a world map He lead my view from the small island to the whole world I am not against the production But we are in the front line We have to be alert to the enemies We are ready to fight against the American Imperialism So we should build the island to a steel fortress at first We should train militia well That's good You are right When you arrange? You arrange by yourselves Gather together! All rise! Right-dress! Eyes front! At ease! Comrades! There are some enemies stealing into our island to have a raid They are in the direction of Hulu Gulf Class 1, occupy the peak of Guanchao Mountain and control 203 upland Class 2,turn left Class 3,turn right Search and besiege the enemies from foothills to the beach Go ahead now! Hurry up Hurry up Caizhu What's wrong with you? How unlucky I am! I've lost my shoes Which one? Both! Here they are Follow up Be quick, follow up Aunt A'hong has fallen down Aunt A'hong, aunt A'hong Aunt A'hong Aunt A'hong Yuxiu, call my grandpa quickly Drive the boat to the Dongsha Hospital Has Aunt A'hong come back? I don't know It's very dangerous for walking on the dark mountain road A'hong has to go further to sea There are two kids at home If he meets with an accident, how could be Impossible It's hard to say There is a militia's drill near the home of grandma of our kids Someone has fallen to their death We walk on this road everyday But why we trap in the stone board last night? She was sent to the hospital But we don't know the situation They didn't follow my advice Why did they have to make a night rally? And it led to a serious accident I'm responsible for this accident I didn't give them enough education I don't have a serious attitude to them I can't agree with it "Emergent rally is not wrong" How can you combine it with this accident? Night rally is needed in the future What? Go on doing night rallies? You always overlook the suggestion of the people I watch you growing up You have gotten involved with CCP these years and taken part in some work And you have become arrogant This is the reason that you have made mistakes I am responsible for this accident I feel sad We should analyse the cause of the accident You can't report the accident to the district like that Why? I have no right to report the accident to the district I have appeased you so much in the past If we don't deal with it seriously you won't know what's wrong going on Personally, you?d better not be a platoon leader I have been busy for a whole night Let me have a meal first Haixia, don't be frustrated Grandpa Liu A'tai said that he went to catch fish when he was 12 years old But it doesn't seem like that Right, I am aware of his hands and legs Sister Haixia Talk later Grandpa Deshun Sister Haixia You have done such a thing You have bared your feet Grandpa Deshun Sister Haixia, Sister Haixia I heard that female militia will not be allowed to stand guard alone. Really? I also heard that female militia's platoon will be dismissed Who said that? That's their rumor It's a rumor It's said that you have made a mistake "Village chief fired you. Is that right?" We have to learn more Where did the rumor come from? These two day the bastard You'er's wife is wandering around The rumor maybe came from her That's right. She also said that Standing guard at night is dangerous Someone may be trapped like Aunt A'hong The bastard You'er He was happily playing something I am watching mountain view on the tower It looks like that someone wants to break the militia platoon down We should hold on We should stand the test in such stormy waves That's right We should learn it clearer OK Let's go Did Huijiang County reply to the letter? No It's time for a reply Did you sent the letter that day? When I finished writing, I handed it over to the bastard You'er to send Why did you let this bastard send the letter? Let me go to ask him Forget it - Send another letter at once - OK Look, the militia are pushing a cannon It looks like mum There's also a machine gun Mum is back Why did you come back? The doctor didn't catch me, and I ran away Have a rest then A'sha, give mum a cup of water Hurry up Did it leave a scar? Leaving a scar is more honour I've been hurt while on duty A'hong came back from the sea He will get even with me Bad girl, If this a scar on your face, how can you get married? Nonsense OK, let's be serious I feel sorry for that gun Can it be fixed? Use mine first What else can you use? Platoon leader can't be without a gun Aunt has been fired She is not a platoon leader any more Get out Nonsense It's real It's real What are you saying? Don't threaten me I didn't believe it If you didn't believe it, why are you so nervous? I have trapped How shall I deal with you? I'll go find Uncle Shuanghe Aunt A'hong It's not your private matter You stay out of it Aunt A'hong You have to rest first Talk about it later You have black eyes You are already tired You should rest too No, I have to inspect the sentries I have heard some rumors outside The militia has a confused mind If I don't inspect the sentries, I won't set my mind at rest Weren't you fired? Why do you still inspect the sentries? Chairman Mao calls for "Turn every man into a soldier" Defending the island is our responsibility I am not a platoon leader any more, but in a militia No one can fire me The timid Yuxiu has overcome the fear She dares to stand guard at night She has grown up Now I can give her a further reminder Oral command Steel Sea Defence What's going on? Nothing on sea And at home at home what's your uncle's word on us? He may not be concerned about this thing He heard of the rumor outside and didn't agree He said that standing guard is the duty of the militia It's not wartime now, but we should stand guard It's not wartime now, but we should stand guard It's peaceful now. Why should you stand guard? Oh, I understand As a militia, we should pay attention at home and in our position That's right Here Haixia suspects Liu A'tai I think that he is not a fisherman Why? Did you pay attention to his feet? We fishermen have bare feet We have to stand steadily on boats So our toes separate like a fan But his toes lie together That's right When he came that night, he cut You'er's hair Laofang Laofang I've found you Grandpa Deshun has told me all Come on, have a look first I have seen it yesterday Someone has removed the stone under the stone board Right. It isn't just an accident It was on purpose Since Liu A'tai has come, Something weird has happened on this island Does it relate to him? I send Caizhu yesterday to the Dongsha Island Post Office to have a search As a result, that transfer letter wasn't sent Why has the letter that investigates Liu A'tai been seized by You'er? What's the relationship between them? Right. The class struggle is so complicated Recently it's not peaceful at sea the activities of the enemies has become more and more frequent But some of our comrades have ignored it These days on the island So many things have happened one by one I also have responsibility Before the meeting Laofang has talked with me You can also give me some suggestions The meeting of branch committee today is also a learning meeting It's not used for criticizing someone Our thought should be improved Comrade Shuanghe, I remembered that you said when you returned to Tongxin Island, The secretary of the county committee has talked with you can you share the details with us? I said that I knew the situation of Tongxin Island well He told me to come back to work for the Party I heard that he gave you something That's right Hand it out Let's see Comrade Shuanghe, the enemies are furious now while you put the weapon into the warehouse See? The guns have rusted badly Comrade, that?s dangerous I... I am too busy to take care of them I will take them out to clean later The rust of the gun is easy to clean But the rust of the thought is not that easy to clean Haixia, read this paragraph OK The imperialists and reactionaries don't take their defeat lying down They want to struggle till the last second After the stability of the country They still plot sabotage by any means They wish a restoration of the old order every day and night That's right No doubt about it We should pay more attention Shuanghe, you have lost your attention Uncle Shuanghe, the collection depot wants bananas Talk it two days later Uncle Shuanghe you should pay more attention to production Your thought of class struggle has been weaker these years We always support the production The mission of bananas' collection is handed to the female militia We work hard for 3 days We will finish it Laofang has come Comrades, Laofang wants to tell us good news By the approval of the District Committee We Tongxin Village need to enlarge the scale of militia We call all the young men of the right age to take part in it actively The male militia that goes to sea will be the first troop Chen A'hong is the troop leader The former female troop and some male militia that stay on island will combine into the second troop Li Haixia will be the troop leader You have learnt my question We have learnt it You are out of age You are not suitable to be in a militia I know who played a trick on me He told me to hand the gun to Jiwu It means that I'm useless Grandpa Wangfa Uncle Shuanghe has good intentions You are too old to be in a militia Stand guard and patrol should be the duty of the young Grandpa, I have found you I have been approved to take part in the militia It will be announced in the meeting But you can't let me carry a fish fork to stand in the queue You have to give me a gun You always remember my gun That's a trophy The district committee allows to give the gun to me I won't give it to you to show up Who shows up? You are growing old Uncle Shuanghe doesn't agree for you to be in a militia The gun will be shown up if you don't stand guard or go on patrol You kid speak so cool But do you know how to use the gun? You suffer for a few days I know the colour of the fish-gang's heart White or black... The tears I cried are more than the water you drank You kid... Grandpa Wangfa, don't be angry What's up? Your grandpa didn't give it to you? No You guys say something Shuanghe said that I am growing old Useless That's right I am a little older So what? I don't think that I am growing old I just have a good living for a few days There were four of us altogether in my happy family in the past And now I am single 30 years ago Our family almost starved to death I exchanged my 5-year-old daughter for 150 kilos of potatoes That year my 3-year-old boy A'bao starved to death The fish-gang Chen Fengshi, the father of Chen Zhan'ao forced my wife to hang herself when I went to sea My brother's family was persecuted by Chen Zhan'ao Most of them were dead Only Jiwu was left Jiwu that kid... That bitterness and hatred were endless This is shot by the Japanese devils It's already 10 years Look, this is stabbed by the KMT bandits by the KMT bandits What the Old Society gave me? Poverty, bitterness and hatred The New Society has given me good living days I just want to stand guard and go on patrol for my country And that's my contribution to my country I am not afraid of Storms and tiredness Instead, I feel excited I have so much power I am eager to kill all the bad guys now If I can't kill some bad guys by myself, I will die with regret Grandpa Wangfa speaks so well We are growing up in bitter waters The Japanese devils, KMT and Chen Zhan'ao gave us endless misery The generations before us have fought and struggled Grandpa Wangfa, you have directly taken part We caught Chen Zhan'ao and his scales with quicksilver on the spot He was full of shame What a pity! In that time we the poor had no weapon in our hands Your dad and Uncle Liu were killed by them Not only them In the Old Society Millions of class brothers were killed by the counter-revolutionary army They froze to death, starved to death There are millions of them Because of the CCP and Chairman Mao, We can have such a good day today Long life CCP! Long life Chairman Mao! We island militia are defending the costal border for the homeland What we do is to defend our socialist system and prevent the proprietary class from recovering Grandpa Wangfa You have seen us growing up We have guns in our hands We should cherish it You may set your mind at rest Haixia, listening to what you said, I understand all Jiwu, give Grandpa Take it Jiwu, what we carry is not only a gun, but also the heart of grandpa Grandpa Wangfa, You are a militiaman in the muster roll Without the muster roll, you are still a militiaman You are right Yesterday Liu A'tai has gone to Dongsha Island to repair the haircutter He didn't come back at night I want to go there and investigate him and then I will report to the district One, two, three Why can't we push it? Stronger then One more time One, two, three OK Thanks, thanks Haixia platoon leader There's no way out there We should take the main road It doesn't matter It will be ok after going through the forest Goodbye Goodbye, goodbye Haixia platoon leader Why did you come here? I took a wrong way A kid told me to take this shortcut But he was playing a trick on me I have gone further and further You have been cheated by the kid Oh no I lost my way I'm tired. I have to rest There are so many people coming to Dongsha Island everyday Such a haircutter can be fixed by anyone That's a petty thing Why should we call someone to fix it? Although that's a petty thing, it shows that we didn't take enough care of you Oh, it's nothing Go. Let me send you back OK According to the detective division's report There's a kind of weird call sign and password wave near the pinewood It fits your report When did you discover the password wave last time? 3 PM, 7 days ago According to the report of militia's post, on this day Liu A'tai went to Dongsha Island He said that he was going to buy a razor That's right According to the time, two password waves are closely related to Liu A'tai The sender may be him So where is his telegraph? His toolbox is always in his hands Maybe hidden there? I have touched it It doesn't look like that According to my observation, Half of his broken leg looks like a fake one Is the telegraph hidden there? Comrade Haixia, protect Aunt Dacheng well and keep close watch over Liu A'tai Understood Change a bottle of wine You... Why you... I want to buy this empty bottle You gave me the bottle Hand it down Hand it down Hand it down If you want struggle, you will die If you want to be forgiven, come clean then OK. Let me come clean Don't kill me The situation is too dangerous We should take action at once We take action according to the original plan at 11PM tonight Don't delay What's on earth Liu A'tai Liu A'tai is the pirate Heifeng His leg was beaten broken when he rescued Chen Zhan'ao What's your plan then? When he came, he plots a plans an attack on Tongxin Island Let me set fire near the fish warehouse When those guys are fighting fire, Chen Zhan'ao can land at once And then It's needed to attack the village government and catch the officers What other bad things have you done? I just did one bad thing Heifeng told me to remove the stone under the stone board Just remove that Why? We hope that Haixia platoon leader may fall to their death We want to break down the militia - Comrade Laofang, phone call - OK Hello? I'm Fang Shixiong Colonel Zhang, what? Something at sea? We just have caught an agent OK, hang in there Haixia You should deal with Heifeng You mustn't move him until the fire breaking out at 11pm Let him send the paragraph - I go to Colonel Zhang - OK I just went out Why did you close the door? I have called for half a day And I couldn't get in You are so sneaky these two days What are you doing? Sister, sit down I have something true to tell you Dacheng is still alive Dacheng and I were caught to Taiwan by KMT We met Chen Zhan'ao there He is a high-ranking officer now He never bears grudges We are all fellow villagers He let Dacheng be his assistant Don't you still believe? Do you know this? Let me tell you Dacheng will fight back tonight You'd better find a boat I will meet them by boat Your family will be reunited at once You came from Taiwan Freeze! What are you doing? Don't be silly You don't consider Dacheng You have to consider yourself and Yuxiu If Dacheng has become a KMT bandit and comes back to the island with Chen Zhan'ao I will let Yuxiu shoot him down Go to report then It's too late Freeze Heifeng, you have finished your mission Telegraph should be handed over It's hid in the broken leg Take him away Heifeng explained that Uncle Dacheng was killed by them Enemies' boats are discovered Ready to fight Understood Fire Kill Chen Zhan'ao, you are surrounded Surrender then! Otherwise, all of you will be annihilated! Freeze Haixia platoon leader The letter comes from Huijiang There's no one called Liu A'tai We have taken a lesson Chen Zhan'ao was annihilated But KMT and American imperialists are still there We should pay more attention to these reactionaries Ready to fight!
