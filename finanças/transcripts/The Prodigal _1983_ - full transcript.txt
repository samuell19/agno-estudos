THE BIG GRAHAM CRACKER HIMSELF, EH? COME ON. HELLO! DID YOU SEE HER? (young man) MR. GRAHAM, DON'T YOU EVER HAVE DOUBTS? I WENT THROUGH A PERIOD OF DOUBT. AND ONE OF THE GREAT STUMBLING BLOCKS WAS WHERE JESUS SAID, "I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE, "NO MAN COMETH TO THE FATHER BUT BY ME." I SAID, HOW CAN ANY MAN STAND UP IN HISTORY AND SAY I AM THE EMBODIMENT OF ALL TRUTH? ALL RELIGIOUS TRUTH, ALL PHILOSOPHICAL TRUTH, ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL TRUTH, ALL SCIENTIFIC TRUTH. I AM TRUTH! WELL, EITHER HE WAS A MANIAC THAT DESERVED TO BE IN AN INSANE INSTITUTION OR HE WAS THE BIGGEST LIAR IN HISTORY, OR HE'S WHO HE CLAIMED TO BE, AND I DECIDED ON THE BASIS OF FAITH-- I COULDN'T PROVE IT IN A LABORATORY, I COULDN'T PROVE IT SCIENTIFICALLY. I COULDN'T EVEN PROVE IT PHILOSOPHICALLY, BUT IN MY HEART, WHEN I SAID, YES, I BELIEVE, WELL, I REMEMBER THAT I WENT THROUGH PEOD OF SERIOUS DOUBTS ON THE BIBLE. IS THE BIBLE THE WORD OF GOD? AND I SAID, LORD, THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THIS BIBLE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. MANY APPARENT CONTRADICTIONS, AND I SAID, BUT FROM NOW ON, BY FAITH, I ACCEPT THIS AS YOUR WORD. AND DO YOU KNOW, SINCE THAT TIME, POINT AFTER POINT THAT TROUBLED ME THEN HAS BEEN CLARIFIED BY SCIENCE OR SOMETHING ELSE AND WHEN I QUOTE THE SCRIPTURE, I KNOW I'M QUOTING THE WORD OF GOD. AND THIS CHANGED MY MINISTRY. IT WAS AT THAT POINT THAT MY MINISTRY CHANGED. MR. GRAHAM? DR. GRAHAM? YES, SIR. UH, MR. GRAHAM, ARE YOU AWARE OF THE ACCOUNT OF HENRY DAVID THOREAU'S DEATH WHEN SOMEONE ASKED HIM IF HE'D MADE PEACE WITH GOD AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT THEY HAD EVER QUARRELED? [laughter] YES, I REMEMBER THAT. AND OF COURSE, UH, THOREAU WAS, UH, IS THE ONE THAT'S MADE FAMOUS BY A STATEMENT THAT HE MADE, AT LEAST THE MOST FAMOUS STATEMENT, IS WHERE HE SAID WE SHOULD BE LISTENING TO A DIFFERENT DRUMMER. YES, WELL, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF THE MYRIADS OF PEOPLE LIKE THOREAU WHO ARE THEISTS, PURVEYORS OF TRUTH, AND YET NOT SUBSCRIBERS TO YOUR PARTICULAR STYLE OF RELIGION? WELL, IT'S NOT SO MUCH A MATTER OF STYLE, AS IT IS WHAT IS TRUTH. THIS IS THE GREAT QUESTION THAT PILATE ASKED, THAT MAN HAS ASKED DOWN THROUGH THE CENTURIES, WHAT IS TRUTH? AND PHILOSOPHY-- THAT'S WHAT PHILOSOPHY'S ALL ABOUT-- WHAT IS TRUTH? WHERE DID I COME FROM? WHY AM I HERE? WHERE AM I GOING? AND THE BIBLE TEACHES THAT WE'RE ALL APPOINTED UNTO DEATH, AND ALL OF US ARE GOING TO DIE. THOREAU HAS ALREADY DIED. I'M GOING TO DIE, YOU'RE GOING TO DIE, AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GOD AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FACE THE JUDGMENT OF GOD AND WE'RE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL OF OUR ACTIONS, OUR THOUGHTS, AND OUR INTENTS AT THAT JUDGMENT, AND IT'S THERE THAT I'M GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY THAT I WAS LISTENING TO THE DRUMMER THAT COMES FROM THE CROSS OF JESUS CHRIST. [student] DR. GRAHAM, THE PHRASE THAT I'VE BEEN... THANK YOU. ...HEARING A LOT LATELY IS THAT WE'RE PRESENTLY IN THE END TIMES. COULD YOU ELABORATE BRIEFLY ON WHAT THAT MEANS?

YOU CAN ACKNOWLEDGE 20 YEARS OF EVERY POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE! PRIVILEGES THAT WERE BOTH COSTLY AND PAID FOR! YOU CAN ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR CHRISTIAN BACKGROUND AND THE FACT THAT YOUR FAMILY DESERVES MORE FROM YOU THAN JUST BOOZE AND DOPE! LOOK, THIS FAMILY HAS ONLY PRODUCED ONE FOR-SURE CHRISTIAN AND IT'S NOT YOU! WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS MORE ON THE ORNAMENTAL SIDE WITH JUST A TINGE OF HYPOCRISY. [slap] [door slams] EL? HUH? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? THE TRUTH? YEAH. AN INTERESTING STATISTIC CAME ACROSS MY DESK LAST WEEK. MUTUAL LIFE ESTIMATES THAT THE COST OF REPLACING A BURNED-OUT EXECUTIVE RANGES BETWEEN TWO-HUNDRED-AND-FIFTY TO FIVE-HUNDRED-THOUSAND DOLLARS. I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW MUCH I'M STILL WORTH. GREG?

I REALLY AM. ♪ ♪ (Billy Graham) LIVING INSIDE YOUR BODY IS YOUR SPIRIT, OR YOUR SOUL, AND THAT'S THE PART OF YOU THAT'S MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND THAT IS THE PART OF US THAT THE WORLD CANNOT SPEAK TO. THAT'S THE REASON THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THE MOST BRILLIANT MEN IN ALL THE WORLD CANNOT COME TO GOD BY THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE AND THEIR OWN WISDOM. BY WISDOM MAN CANNOT KNOW GOD. GOD IS BEYOND OUR HUMAN UNDERSTANDING. BUT GOD HAS REVEALED HIMSELF TO US, IN NATURE, IN YOUR CONSCIENCE WITHIN, AND IN THIS BOOK, AND MORE PERFECTLY, IN THE PERSON OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. I WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD ONE DAY WITH ONE OF MY SONS WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE AND WE STEPPED ON AN ANT HILL, AND A LOT OF ANTS DIED AND A LOT OF THEM WERE WOUNDED, AND I WANTED TO TEACH HIM A LESSON AND I SAID, WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF WE COULD GO DOWN THER AND CRAWL AROUND AMONG THEM AND TELL THEM THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY MEAN TO DO THIS AND HELP THEM REBUILD THEIR HOUSE AND BURY THEIR DEAD AND SO FORTH. AND HE SAID THAT IT SURE WOULD BUT HE SAID, WE'RE TOO BIG AND THEY'RE TOO LITTLE. AND I SAID, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. GOD LOOKED UPON THIS LITTLE PLANET, THIS LITTLE SPECK OF DUST, AND SAW THESE LITTLE CREATURES CALLED MEN AND WOMEN, WALKING AROUND, LOST, AWAY FROM HIM. HOW COULD HE COMMUNICATE WITH THEM? THE MIGHTY GOD OF HEAVEN? I SAID, WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF WE COULD BECOME AN ANT FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES AND HELP THEM? HE SAID, YES, I THINK IT WOULD. I SAID, THAT'S WHAT GOD DID. GOD BECAME A MAN! GOD BECAME A MAN, AND THAT'S WHO JESUS CHRIST WAS, THE GOD-MAN. HE CAME FOR THE PURPOSE OF DYING. HE CAME TO PERFORM THE GREATEST WORK THAT ANYONE HAD EVER DONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. HE CAME TO TAKE OUR SINS ON THE CROSS, TO TAKE OUR JUDGMENT AND OUR HELL ON THAT CROSS. AND THAT'S WHY ALL OVER THE WORLD YOU SEE A CROSS ON EVERY CHRISTIAN CHURCH BECAUSE THE CROSS IS THE HEART OF WHAT THIS BIBLE TEACHES. AND IN THAT MOMENT, WHEN HE SAID, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU "FORSAKEN ME?"-- IN THAT SUPREME MOMENT THAT NONE OF US CAN PENETRATE, NO THEOLOGIAN IN THE WORLD HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND-- GOD TOOK ALL THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND LAID THEM UPON CHRIST. HE LITERALLY WENT TO HELL IN YOUR PLACE. NO WONDER THE BIBLE SAYS GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD! THINK OF SUCH LOVE. AND THEY PUT NAILS IN HIS HANDS, AND A CROWN OF THORNS ON HIS BROW AND A SPIKE THROUGH HIS FEET AND HE HUNG THERE. THEY LAUGHED AT HIM AND SAID, HE SAVED OTHERS, WHY DOESN'T HE SAVE HIMSELF? WHY DOESN'T HE COME DOWN FROM THE CROSS? IF HE'D COME DOWN FROM THE CROSS, YOU AND I'D NEVER MADE IT TO HEAVEN. HE STAYED ON THE CROSS SO YOU AND I CAN BE IN HEAVEN. AND SO WE CAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE AND HAVE OUR SINS FORGIVEN. YES, THERE'S A MYSTERY ABOUT IT. IT'S A SUPERNATURAL WORK OF GOD IN OUR HEARTS. WHEN WE REPENT OF OUR SINS AND RECEIVE CHRIST AS SAVIOR, THE BIBLE CALLS IT, AS I SAID YESTERDAY, BEING BORN AGAIN. YOU CAN'T INHERIT IT. YOU CAN BE BORN IN A CHRISTIAN HOME, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU A CHRISTIAN. YOU CAN GO TO CHURCH, BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. YOU CAN BE BAPTIZED, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. JESUS SAID, YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. MANY TIMES IT'S LIKE NATURAL BIRTH. THERE'S A MOMENT OF CONCEPTION. THERE'S THE MOMENT-- THERE ARE MONTHS OF GESTATION, AND THEN THERE'S ACTUAL BIRTH. TONIGHT IT MAY BE FOR YOU A MOMENT OF CONCEPTION. IT MAY BE ANOTHER STEP IN GESTATION, OR IT MAY BE ACTUAL BIRTH. IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO REMEMBER FROM THIS NIGHT ON, IT'S THIS... THAT WHATEVER YOU'VE DONE, WHATEVER YOU'VE THOUGHT, GOD LOVES YOU. WHATEVER YOUR CONDITION, WHOEVER YOU ARE, WHATEVER FEELINGS YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEART RIGHT NOW, GOD LOVES YOU. SOME OF YOU THAT FEEL THE MOST TURNED OFF ARE THE ONES THAT GOD MAY LOVE THE MOST HERE TONIGHT. AND BECAUSE HE'S GOD HE CAN CONCENTRATE ON YOU AND YOUR NEEDS AND YOUR PROBLEMS AS THOUGH YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD. YOU'RE NOT JUST SITTING OR STANDING HERE TONIGHT IN THIS GREAT THRONG OF PEOPLE-- YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL. YOU'RE HERE BY YOURSELF BEFORE CHRIST. YOU'RE ALONE BEFORE HIM. THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR PARENTS CAN'T ENTER INTO WITH YOU. THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND BOYFRIEND CAN'T ENTER WITH YOU. IT'S ALONE, JUST LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO DIE, YOU DIE ALONE. WHEN YOU COME TO CHRIST, THAT'S A DECISION YOU HAVE TO MAKE. YOU MAY BE IN THE CHOIR, YOU MAY BE A LEADER IN YOUR CHURCH, BUT DEEP IN YOUR HEART YOU'RE NOT SURE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST, AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE TONIGHT. YOU GET UP AND COME. COMING FORWARD IS AN OUTWARD ACT TO GOD AND MAN THAT YOU'RE MAKING AN INWARD COMMITMENT TONIGHT. LET'S JUST COME IN THE QUIETNESS AND THE SILENCE. I BELIEVE GOD IS HERE. THIS IS YOUR MOMENT AND YOUR HOUR WITH GOD, AND YOU KNOW IT. JESUS SAID, BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR OF YOUR HEART AND KNOCK. IF ANYONE HEARS MY VOICE AND OPENS THE DOOR, I'LL COME IN. THE HANDLE OF THAT DOOR IS ON THE INSIDE. YOU MUST TURN IT YOURSELF. NOW YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIGURE ALL THAT OUT MAYBE WITH YOUR MIND. IF COMING TO CHRIST HAD ANYTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH I.Q., IT WOULD MEAN THAT GOD IS A RESPECTER OF PERSONS. SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT THE WORLD'S WAY FOR YEARS. YOU'VE TRIED IT ALL--- YOU'VE COME UP EMPTY. LET JESUS CHRIST FILL ALL THOSE EMPTY PLACES TONIGHT. WHATEVER YOUR BACKGROUND. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO JOIN A SPECIAL CHURCH TONIGHT. I'M ASKING YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT CHRIST LIVES IN YOUR HEART. IF THERE'S A DOUBT IN YOUR HEART, YOU COME AND MAKE SURE TONIGHT. [choir hums softly] I WANT TO GIVE MYSELF TO HIM...
