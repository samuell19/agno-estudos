- It's kinda tricky to see right now, but if you start at that northeast corner of those four stars that form a square, that's the great square of Pegasus. And coming off of it is like that handle, that's not even our galaxy anymore. That's, that's Andromeda. It's a whole other galaxy, 2.5 million light years away. Andromeda's where they live. I was 15 when they first took me. Oh. And that's how I got this. - Easy, sweetheart. - No. It's not that. See. That's where they extracted the DNA. And then two days ago I saw them again. You ever wake up from a dream and it's like you're still dreaming? Hello? Hi, are you awake? I saw a light on. Oh, I thought I saw a light. But you're Peter, yeah? Like your name is Peter. - No, I'm, I don't have a name and nobody's here is to go away now. - Okay, well even if that's, that's not your name, I'd really, really love to talk with you really quickly if, if possible please? - Oh my God. Hey, whoever's out there, just fuck off, okay. - I totally get that. I'll just, I will go away, I promise. As soon as you just talk to me for like 10 seconds. Hello. - It's not even six in the morning. I was in bed, you know, asleep having this really terrific little dream and I would love, love, love to get back to that. So I need you to just take all of this away. - Do you have a car? I need a car. - No, I don't have a car, goodbye. - I, I, I, wait. Just, I believe you. I really do. It's just that I heard you on the phone one time in the hallway. What, I, I wasn't eavesdropping. I was just going up to my apartment. And you said that you had less than zero interest in selling my, your mother effing car. - What, no, goodbye. - Your name is Peter. It's written on the buzzer in the front of the building. I see it almost every day. Me and David are four C. So, so your name is right below his name. Peter, I can pay you. - How much? - $1,700. - 1700? Jesus, you've got money, go find your own stupid car. - The thing is, I, I, I would, but I can't 'cause I don't have a license. - So, okay. You want me to let you, a person I do not know, but has no driver's license, that's the one thing that I do know, to drive my car to where? - Oh, it's really not that far. It's just a few hours up north. It's to visit my sister. - Visit your sister where? - This little, little town. Little cute little town near Lapeter City. - In Canada? - Yeah, she's Canadian. I will pay you $1,700 cash, but I have to leave right now. Okay, I have to be there at 9:27 PM three days from today. And I cannot be late, I just can't. - Late to visit your sister? - Uh-huh. - I'm going back to sleep now. - No please. Just do this one little favor for me-- - No, I think I need you to go actually. - But I, it's only a few days, I don't-- - I think I need you to go. - I don't know anyone else. - Not my problem. It's not my problem. - I have no one, come on. - Fucking listen. I do not know you. I do not like you just from two minutes of this and I'm not letting you borrow my goddamn car. Half the money beforehand. Now. - Whoa, what? - What, what? If I get half of the 1700 in advance, you can borrow Shay's, borrow my car on three conditions. One, no eating and no drinking inside. You don't strike me as a very tidy person. Two, no parallel parking. If you need to stop, you find a nice easy spot where you can pull right into. No back and forth, no adjusting the wheel. And, and three I come too. - You, you wanna drive to Canada? - God, no. I, no, but I was supposed to before and I didn't. And if I don't go now, I never will. So, 1700, half up front. - Anything, anything you want, I, you dunno how much this means to me. Here. - Okay. Wait here, I'll pack. - Oh, Mr. Peter H, Winona J. J for Jordan. Can already tell this is gonna be amazing. - Yeah. So fucking amazing. - So amazing. - I don't know. It's not like you have like the official paperwork. - What are you looking for here, huh? The deed of sale. You don't have that. You don't have anything. You have less than I do for if we're counting because at least I have her keys. - Well, I too have a pair of keys right inside. - Nico, don't be a fucking prick. - Listen here you little Judy Garland piece of shit. This is Shay's car, okay? And I am Shay's brother, so I don't know if she told you that you could have this car, but I see no proof of that. All I see is two broke asses in my front yard. - Nico. Nico. So we just wanna borrow your car. That's it. It's a personal favor for me so that I can go visit my mom up north and you're gonna get it back. Okay? You seem like such a sweet, sensitive kind of guy. You know, it would mean so much to me. - Who's this bitch? - My Tai chi instructor. Nico, we're taking the car. Shay gave it to me. It's mine. End of discussion. - Man, fuck you. - Fuck you. - No, fuck you. - Fuck you. - You said you had the other key, right? - Yes, I have the other key. - Okay, so could you go get it so we could maybe compare keys? I don't know, maybe there was like a mistake or something. And if we have the wrong key, then you were right and we will just move along. Thank you. - Fine. But I have business dealings to conduct. I'm an entrepreneur. I make money moves. - Gimme the keys. - What? - Give me the keys. - No. - Give the-- - No. Hey, hey, stop, don't touch me. Wait. Wait, Winona. Winona, this is a crime. This is stealing. No, no, no. No. Shame, shame, shame. He's gonna be back in 10 seconds, I'm not getting, there's a moral code. - Listen. I am going with or without you, so get in the goddamn car. Ugh, let's go, come on, hurry up. - Goddamn it. - Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry. - Shit. Fuck. Winona. Winona, pull over. Pull over the goddamn car. - Hey. Hey. What are you doing? - Oh, just calling the cops. - Please don't call the cops. - You stole a fucking car. - No, I helped you get your car back. - This is insane. This is fucking insane. What are you doing Winona? Where are you trying to take us? Fuck it, I'm calling the cops. - No, just, just wait a second. - I'd like to report a stolen vehicle-- - Fine. - In the vicinity-- - Fine, fine, fine, fine-- - Third Street and-- - I will tell you. I will tell you. Hang up. Thank you. Peter, I promise that this will all make a lot more sense when I can show you. - Show me what? - The abduction site. - The abduction site? - Yeah, so would you please get back in the car? - Let's go to the abduction site. - And I remember it, it felt like riding in an elevator when you never even heard of an elevator. And there's this computer that translates everything you think or say. And they told me that I had been chosen extra specially. And then they told me their name, which doesn't actually translate exactly. So we call them the bridge people. - Ooh, huh, huh, the bridge people. Now, okay, I remember the cowboy and the construction guy. And what was the, oh, the leather daddy. But who, who was the-- - The bridge people are an advanced, harmonious species. I mean, in Andromeda, there's, there's like these, these things that are like bridges, but that's like saying that sunsets are like grapefruits and they sail across the universe on these massive strands of starlight and energy. But they need human DNA to reproduce. - By abducting new bio teen girls? - We call it intersecting and in exchange for allowing them to intersect, I get to go back. - Oh, you get to go back to Mormon space camp? - It's not. That's what they told me when I was 15. And then two days ago I saw them again. They told me where I had to be and when. It's two days, twenty-one hours and four minutes. And if I miss it, that's it. But I won't because I have you and I have your car and you think I'm delusional right now. - Oh, well how could I, when presented with such a concise, logical argument. - You said you had to be somewhere too, right? - One quick pit stop, a beach on this ugly little lake. - Ooh, it's sounds super duper romantic. - Not unless you got got a cock and balls squirreled away somewhere. - How do you know I don't? Come on, let's rest up before the border tomorrow. Canada, woo. - Darling, I am not leaving this car. Fuck you very much. - I'm not gonna steal your car. - You already did. So go be crazy somewhere else and let me sleep in peace. - Don't call me crazy. - What? - I said, just don't call me that. I'm not. And anyway, you're the one who's all weird and horny for your big pink car. - It belonged to a friend. - It's just a place I saw in a magazine. I only wanna go if it's us. Promise we'll go together, you and me. Cross your heart and hope to die. Promise? - I promise. - You sleep okay? - Yeah. Just, I've got a bad back, that's all. - Uh-huh, that's what that nice comfy motel bed was for. Hopefully it's nothing a little Vicodin and whiskey soda can't fix. - I don't drink. - You're sober? - No, I just don't drink. Oh, pull over, I gotta get my passport out of the trunk. - Don't need it. Takin' the back way. Secret threshold. - Oh. So another crime. - If we get caught. - Yeah. - You know when it's just the two of us, you don't have to wear that. I mean, I don't wanna be depressing, but if I got it, you got it. So. Now you can breathe like the human being. Hey, hey, yeah. The spot you said a couple minutes early. Yeah, yeah, I brought a friend too. It's a, no no, no, it's not that kind of friend. But, thank you for asking. I feel fine, I feel fine. I feel functional, you know, I'm like, yeah, well, you know, it's not nothing for me. Okay. Okay, Suzee. Okay, I love you. Love you. See you soon. Okay bye. Bye. - You know, you have a phone and I have a phone, which makes wait for it, wait, wait, two phones. - Too dangerous. Unless it's a life or death emergency. You know, they can trace outgoing calls. - Who? - Anyone who really wants to. There she is. - You can tell your mother she can take whatever she fucking wants It's my dream for when I get back. Win, win, win. - Suzee, meet my current traveling companion, Peter. Peter, this is Suzee. She's gonna help us cross over. - Oh, glorious. Which way is Canada? - Didn't anybody ever teach you the shortest distance between two points? Straight fucking line, baby. You all want? This is some God tear shit. - Yeah, I could take some. - No, we do not. - You know, you'll get a tummy ache if you keep reading in the car. - Here's something. Don't ever talk to me like I'm a child or use words like "tummy" or "grumpy" or "wa wa wa" that sort of sound. I'm a fully adult man-- - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay. - Fuck me. Do not touch me. Suzee, you gonna get scooped up by the little green men too? - No. Nah. This planet might be a worn out crap sack just spinning through the void, but goddammit, I am fond of it. I spent 16 years in finance. That's a one and a six. Then one day I realized that all those numbers I spent years obsessing over, they were all made up, pure fiction, which led me to the most important step of all. - Self-reflection. - What? - Self-reflection. - No drugs. Easy around the yellow stumps. Okay, they got electronic sensors buried underneath. - That cannot possibly be true. - It is. We made it, my people. We're on the other side. - Don't. This is to ease your passage. Here, take it. No, no, no. Take this. - Come on. - This for you. Call me, no, whenever you're ready to return to reality, okay? You know I'm gonna fucking miss you. You know that. Say hi to the universe for me. Go. Go. - Jesus. Just crack it over the back of my skull. Skip the niceties. - Are you paying for food or affection? - That is the most rational person I've ever met. Hey. Hey. Cut it out, you're an adult. So I take it your a whore of some sort. What? - I do sex work. That is a thing that I do. And sometimes it's camming and sometimes it's stripping. Occasional dirty video. I escort but that's not really possible at the moment. - Ever consider a job where the skirt and panties stay on? - I am a human being who does sex work. That is a thing that I do. Okay? But I also like to think that you and me and sometimes other people are more than the one or two things that they do. Like if I ask you what you are. - Please don't. - You wouldn't say, oh, I'm just a pissed off, miserable guy who hates everything. - No, I would say that. Excuse me. Hey, I've been asking for more coffee for five fucking minutes. - Tell me about yourself, Peter. - Absolutely not. Excuse me. Can we just get a refill when our goddamn... Jesus. - Can I get a beer? - No, no, she's joking. You wanna know who, and or what I am Winona? All right. I, am a circle inside a circle inside a circle. I am a college educated homosexual dwarf in a world with little to no patience for intelligence, for men who fuck other men, or for bodies that are not of a highly specific make and model. I, am unemployed. I'm balding. I'm prone to illness. Statistically, I'm gonna die sooner rather than later. Oh, oh, oh and I am so goddamn smart, Winona. Sometimes I feel like I know everything and I know, I know that I'm not a part of anything. - You know, I used to have a lot of self pity when I thought that I had to live like this in this world. But I don't. So I don't. - Unless you do. - But I don't. - First word, fuck. Second word, no. - It will be so, so neat and so clean. - I don't care, the answer is no. - But it ain't a real road trip without snacks. Oh, and road beers. - I, you don't have a license. You don't have a passport. We are in this country illegally. And you want to not only drink and drive, but drink while driving. - Road beers, road-- - Winona, my answer is no. - Road beers, road beers, road beers. - Winona. - Road Beers. Road beers. - Winona, shut the fuck up! Pump the gas and let's go. This place is giving me deliverance vibes. Hey, hey. I saw that. - You were supposed to. - Uh, hello. Hey. Hello. - Hey. - Sorry. We don't want to be weird but a, are you, her? - I don't think I know you guys. I'm sorry. - No, no. No, no. Her like, dude, show her the... - Hey, everybody. Winona here. So custom videos are available. Just. Yes, that's me. Just subscribe. - Cool. - Let's have some naughty fun together. - Very, very cool. - We've got an appointment with some little green men. Let's get going. - Hey, shut up. - Not talking to you kid. Winona. - He said shut up. - You shut up. You pimple faced Eric Klebold looking shit stain. - Fuck you mini me. - Sorry, what was that there? - Fuck you, you midget fuck. - All right guys, let's calm down with the name calling. Peter, can we not right now? - All right, listen up. Before you ever consider the notion of-- - Get off of him. - Get off of me. Fuck you. - Get off of him. - Shit, wait, wait, what's he doing? - I don't know. - What did you do? - Shit, I, I don't, yeah, I don't, I don't. I'm, I'm out. Fuck. - Peter, Peter. - Call 911 or something. Okay. - Shit, Peter, Peter. Peter. Help! Help! Help! Help! Peter, Peter. Peter. Peter? Are you okay? - Ah, moose fuckers. Everybody in this goddamn fucking country, moose ender puffin' fuckers. Wish they hadn't scuttled away so quick. Next I roll on the rack, roll around on the ground and froth and kick. Once I pushed and almost shit myself. - Peter. - Almost. - You're okay? - Oh yeah. I'm gonna live forever. - Peter. - Forever baby! - Peter. - So fucking tired. Let's go back home, please. - I'm sorry, there's no time. - This can't be real. None of this is happening. It's just, it's just more bad pill dreams. I'm not gonna be every random hick asshole's freak show. Okay? I just need to be back inside, in my apartment, please. Please take me back. - We have to keep going. You need the money and you don't get the money if we don't keep going. - Need the money. Fuck money. Fuck. - What about your friend? Come on. Let me help you. - Sir? - What? - Sir, have you been drinking tonight? - What, no. Fuck off. - Sir. - I just told you to fuck, ow, Jesus fuck. What the fuck? - I'll ask you again, sir. Have you been drinking tonight? - No. I, I don't, I don't drink ever. I'm, I'm not gonna be someone's funny little drunk fucking dwarf. - Right? Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the vehicle. - Are you kidding? - Step out of the car, sir. - Winona. - Stop touching the woman and step out of the car or I will have to radio for backup. - This is bullshit. This is so fucking bullshit. Okay, I'm out. I'm out. - Sir, are you familiar with intergalactic ordinance L17? - Intergalactic what? - Sir, the ordinance states any species with a class three civilization or higher, that includes you, sir. Will be held accountable-- - Wait, wait, wait, wait, no. - Planetary-- - No, I, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't do anything. - Sir, are you or are you not a self-identified human being? - Yes. - And this is your planet? - Okay, no, I listen, I need to-- - Oh, hey, easy there. Step back toward the car. Step back now. - Okay. - Sir, I'm gonna need you to remove your articles of clothing. - What? - Sir? - Why? - I'm not gonna repeat. - No, okay. Okay, I'm. Fine, I just. Why aren't you wearing a shirt? - Sir, are you familiar with the name Shay Alvarez? Are you aware of what befell Ms. Alvarez in August of last year? At that time, did Shay suffer from mental illness or depression? - She, she was in constant pain, but it can be depressing. - The skin too. Now. - Ow. I'm sorry, I can't do it. - Are you trying to cause trouble, sir? - No, I. - Am I gonna need to confiscate this vehicle? - No, no, no, no. Don't take her car. Don't touch her car. Don't. Please, please. - Sir, do you recall exactly what happened the night your friend passed away? - Yes. Yes, she, she called me on the phone and she told me that she was hurting worse than she ever had. - And what did you say to her? - I said, go back to sleep. It was late and I, I was tired and I, I didn't know. I didn't know. - Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to come with me. - No. No. Fuck you. - Shit. Morning. - Is it? Hey are you all right? - Hmm, huh? Let's go. - Okay, can I pee? Please? - Hey, you know, later I thought maybe I could read your book. - Don't bother. You wouldn't get it. - Says who? - Says me, the expert. How do I say this? Anton Chekhov is the greatest writer who ever lived period. Next to him, Bill Shakespeare looks like a second string little frilly collared bitch. - I almost admire your confidence of your own opinions. - This, oh fuck. Fuck. Fucking back. - You should be careful. - Careful fucking of what? - Dunno just, just careful. - Careful. Careful, she says. Just careful. Winona. - It won't start. The fuck, won't start. It won't-- - Wait, wait. Just wait a second. - No. - Wait a second. - You hold on a second. - Wait, wait. Jesus. - Oh. - You're a people person, right? - Hey, hi. Hello. Hello. Fuck, this is taking too long. - How about you flash your tits? - How about you flash your tits? - Hey, no, no, I was, I was kidding. - Even a broken asshole's right twice a day. Hi, hi, hi, hi. Hey. SOS, hello. - Hi, can you-- - Hi. - Help. - Yes. Yes. - Should I say something? - Depends. - Depends on what? - On if your entire personality changes in the next 15 seconds. - Having a bit of car trouble, eh? - Yeah. Yeah, we, we were just hoping you guys could give us a super quick jump. - Oh, yeah. What's the kerfuffle? - Nothing, they just need a quick jump. - We'd so, so appreciate it. - Oh, I'm, I'm Lola Nelson, by the way. And the space lady is Sadie. - Oh, I just love your outfit. It's so shiny. - I know, right? Oh, check this out. - Fuck. - Whoa. Easy. The head and the suit and everything, it's all just for characters from Galaxy X. - What, what is that, a Canadian thing? - Sort of. Like the OG manga and anime are obviously Japanese, but they shoot the TV show in Vancouver. - Oh, they, they shot the second season in the Ukraine. - Sorry. They shot the second season in the Ukraine. Thank you Lola, for correcting me about something so important in front of these people that we just met. - You're so welcome. - Uh-huh, ah, just with the cables, we're just kind of, we're on a timeline. - All the big cons got canceled this summer. So I begged and I borrowed, and I got down on my knees until Lola agreed to do this road trip with me instead. - We drove up from Toronto yesterday. - Yeah. We listened to like six hours of podcasts about dead people nobody's ever heard of. - Just that you've never heard of. - And it's so great that you guys do that together. - Oh, I love cosplay. But to do it full-time, you also have to do all the shitty gross stuff. You know, like, even the top, top girls still do things like Only Fans and sell nudes and stuff. And it's just like, have some self-respect, you know? - Yeah. Yeah, totally. - I mean, fuck that though. - Excuse me? - I said, fuck self-respect. You can't eat it. You can't sell it. And you know, it only matters if you decide it matters to other people because of whatever dumb thing. So, fuck that. And let them sell pictures of their feet to creeps in peace. Anyway, that's one opinion. - Yeah, I mean, I also have my opinion as a professional. - Well, okay, cool. So, whose Chekhov is in the passenger seat? - Oh, oh me, mine. - Oh, remember from the podcast? How could I forget? - I actually studied him, or, I mean, I wrote my thesis on his nonfiction. - Honestly, I don't know how you could do that without killing yourself. The podcast made him sound so sad. - Sad? Sad is the understatement of the millennia. His characters aren't sad. They're, they're tragic. - Yeah. Yes. I mean, the, the sad part, like the actually sad part is that these people, they have their heads so far up their own asses that they can't take 'em out in time to unfuck their own lives. - So what's the ETA on the car? - Oh, yeah, sorry. - Just rev it up again. - Uh-huh. And actually you should start your engine. - Okay. - Hey, yeah. There we go. Jesus Murphy. Hey, you know, you should be a mechanic. - Hey, any chance that you wanna be an Ewok for me, you know, with like a big furry hood and a mask? - I'll pass. - He passes. - Heard him. - Thanks guys. - All right. See you around. - Thank you. - Happy light reading. - And hey, you got to talk about your guy. That was nice. Peter? -Uh? You just, you weren't there for a second. Like you. Oh my God. How could you forget something like this? I mean, what should we do? Should we just leave it here in case they come back? Peter, what do you wanna do? - Let's drive. So what's the intersection gonna look like when it happens? I wanna mentally and emotionally prepare myself. - Well, I mean, whatever happens, it's not gonna be how you imagine from a movie. - Why not? - The bridge people can manipulate our reality and our perception of our reality however they want in ways we literally cannot perceive. - Gonna make your intersection? - Yeah. We're ahead of schedule actually. - No. How is that even possible? Hey. - I don't know. Maybe we drove through a portal. - Or a black hole. - Nah, we would've been spaghetti-fied. And the entire planet would be gone. - I'm still here. - Still here. - This is my favorite way to look at the world. You spy someone's little light on somewhere. Or maybe it's just a television screen, but your brain fills in the blank. - I look through people's windows sometimes back in my apartment, just across the courtyard. Not like going out of my way to, anyway. If I look up and I see something, then sometimes I'll keep looking. - Why would you do it? - The same reason people watch TV and read interviews with strangers. The dream of another, better life. - Peter. Peter. Come on, let's hit the hay. - Go on, I'm just gonna. - Peter. - I would enjoy a shower. - Honey, you need a shower. - Do I? - Yeah, you're nasty. - Oh, I'm nasty? - Nast, nasty. You nasty, nasty. - I'm nasty. - Yeah. Come on. - Hey, you know, I, I am thirsty. - I got ice from the machine. - No, I just, I don't know, I don't know. You wanna go grab a beer? - Grab what? - I don't know, I just. Yes? - You don't drink. - No, I, thank you, yes, I know. But I, I mean, I don't want any liquor. I just, I don't, I just wanna be around people like, you know, like, maybe, I don't know, like maybe at that, whatever that place is across the road, maybe. - You wanna be around people? - Well, six feet apart. - Is that why you're dressed so nice? - But, yes. Yes. People, uh-huh. Uh-huh. - Peter, I'm like half asleep. - Well, hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no. Winona. Listen. Do you really wanna spend your last night on the planet Earth lying in your bed? - No. - There we go. Yes. Yes, just, just, let's just go have a drink. One quick drink, and then you know, it's back to Chekhov. - Okay, fine. Let me just put my face on. - Oh, no, no, just wear the, wear the mask. - Wait, why don't you just go ahead without me. Grab me a beer. - Thank you. - Oh no. Actually get me a vodka tonic. - Oh, a vodka tonic. - Yeah. - Okay, miss vodka tonic, okay. Okay, let me just. Fuck. Hotel mirrors. God, do I look okay? Yeah, all right. Okay, I'll see a minute. - See you in a minute. - Okay. - Just be careful. - Be careful of what? - I don't know. Crossing the road, just be careful. - All right then. - See ya. - Un minuto. Cheers. - Hi. One vodka tonic. And let's do that with your second nicest vodka. And then I'll also take a Diet Coke with no ice. Seriously, no ice. - Thank you, thank you. - Why only second best? - Sorry. So, I'm sorry, what did you say? What did you say? - You asked her to pour you the second nicest vodka they had. I was pondering at that point, why spare the expense. - The best, or like the, the most top shelf liquor at your average bar is, is always gonna have the highest markup, as a rule. - But it's still the best in't it? - Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is. - You're American. - Mm. And you're Canadian, eh? - Born and bred. Sorry about that. - Oh, I was, so. You must be sick to death of all the, you know, I mean, you do look a little bit lumberjackie though. It, it invites commentary. - Right, sure, yeah, I bring it upon myself. - Yes or not. I, I, ugh, I'm, I'm, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry. It's, it's been a minute since I've engaged in any casual conversation with a strange man. Sorry. I'm, I'm, I'm rusty. - Yeah, I can tell. It's the real reason I'm sitting so far, actually. - Oh, it's not the plague? - Oh, no, this is much more of a social distance, you know, and a social distance. Are you waiting on someone? - She's late, I don't. - Oh, she. - Oh, long, long, fucking long story. That's story for another day. - Yeah. Just glad I wasn't totally misreading the situation. - Yeah, no, you are not. - Do you want to dance with me? - How'd you get this number? - I, I keep a picture of her in my book. I use it as a book mark so she's always there, you know. So she's always with me. - I'm sorry to hear about your friend. That sounds like you're a good friend to her. - No. - Oh, yeah. I didn't say perfect. I wish I could. Right? Good is good, you know, good is all we can get. - This is good. - Good? - This is perfect. I'm going to her beach tomorrow. The one, she's, the one she thought we were gonna see together. - Are you nervous? - It's just sand, water, sky. This is, this is good. - Are you nervous? - It's just sand, water, sky. - Are you nervous? - It's just sand, water. I'm, I'm so sorry. Did, you asked me, you asked me something? - Oh, no. Fuck no. It was, wasn't like a question. It was just, you know, you're American. - Yes, oh. And, and you are Canadian. - Oh, well, shit obviously. Hey, you know, and I hope this is okay to say, right? But I don't think I've ever seen, you know, like. - What? - You know, like, like, a person, people like, like you, you know, like, like in person, you know? - Oh, yes. We, yeah, we are rare, rare birds. - Uh-huh. In a shit town like this, you don't get too many fucking dwarves or whatever the right word is now. - Little person. - Little person. Shit, sorry, man. But that's way worse than fucking dwarf for a midget or whatever, fuck. - It's the word. Hey, I was, I was-- - What the fuck?! - What? No, I, I didn't. - I'm not a fag. - No. No. No, that's, no, that's not what I'm, I didn't. No. - One more. Winona? Hello, oh, fucking. Winona. Winona, open up, I need to pee. Winona, open the, open the fucking door. I'm gonna piss my pants. - Peter. - Yes. - Is anyone out there with you? - What? No, just, just come out and talk like a normal person. I already waited over there for you for a fucking hour. Thank you. I just, fuck. Unlock the door. - If I come out, do you promise that there's no one else there and that you checked outside too? - What? Fucking. All right, I'll check. No, no one, it's just us. Hey. - Okay, step back, I'm coming out. - Hey, did you unlock the phone? Hey, there she is. Hey, were you just in there all night? We were gonna go have a drink, remember? Do you remember? - Yes, yeah. - So what the, what the hell happened? What happened Winona? Hey did you, did you unplug the phone? Hey, stop it. Winona. Stop it. Stop. Stop it. What are you doing? - People know that I'm here and they're coming to bring me back. - You're not me. You're not making, back, where? Back where? - To New York. - Winona, okay, just fucking sit. Just sit down. Just sit down. - There's no time. - Oh, why, why? Because the magical aliens will zap back into space without you if you don't get there at, what is it? What is it? Let me see. 50th two 54. - That's what they said. - It's not real, Winona. - Stop. - It's not real. - Stop it. - And I'm so sorry the universe doesn't work like you want it to work. But Winona, Winona, we get put in our bodies in this place, and we live and we die, and we decompose here. - Drunk, you're drunk. - I'm not drunk. I'm, I'm fine, fine, I'm, but that doesn't mean what I'm saying isn't true. This, this world, this fucking, the, the frame, the, the, the, the, the world. It does not want us. We do not fit. We do not have a place because we are mistakes. - You. All of your problems are just things that you do to yourself because you are a bitter gutless, heartless little human. - So I'm a little, I'm a little. - Yeah, little, little, little. You make rules and then you get mad when people break rules and you pick fights, and then you act like you're being attacked. And this fucking death wish, horny for death bullshit. You are unlovable, Peter, because everything that is in you is bad. I'm leaving. - Wonderful. Perfect, that. Go. Just fucking get the fuck out of here. Go. Keep pretending there's something else waiting somewhere. Sorry you have to hear this from a fucked up little fag midget, but actions have consequences, you crazy bitch. Winona. Fuck you! Dragging me across the fucking continent. What the shit! I should be at home. I should, I should be in bed. I had a whole thing. And you ruined it. You ruined it. You made me fucking, you. Hey, Winona. Winona. Don't fuck. You were right about me. - What? - You were right about well, not everything, but you were right about me. You wanna stand up? - I can't move. - That's okay. That's okay. - It didn't happen. - What? - I came when they said, 46 minutes ago, and I'm still here. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry too. I'm sorry I called you what I called you. - I called you worse. - I have got terrible, terrible corns. Oh, geez. - Excuse me? - Corns on the balls, of both my feet. I say this by way of explanation as to why I am not standing up right now. Why I sat down instead of, you know, addressing you face to face, eye to eye. Well, you beat us here. Good on you for that. You know, the two of you together plus us, that's makes a, a seven. - Seven what? - Abigail, will you kindly. - Fuck me with a rusty spoon. - A rusty what did, what did you? - Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Winona, I. - Hi. - Oh, hi there, young lady. - Hi. I, I thought I, I guess I, I didn't, I didn't think you, you're, you're still here. - Well, now what are your two names? - Winona J. J for Jordan. - And I'm Sir Paul McCartney. - Peter. - Peter, yes. Yes, my, my name is Peter, and I am not a part of this. - Well, that's all right. Abigail, how much longer do we have? - Three hours, 11 minutes. - Three hours, 11 minutes? I wrote it wrong. - Whatever you did or you did not do, Miss Winona Jordan, I'm sure it came from your heart. - So, this has been fun. Winona, I guess this is where I leave you. - You can stay, you can, I mean-- - What? Go to, that sounds very, very appealing. I mean it. - Oh, oh, I, for your trouble and your car. - Thank you, thank you. Well, it's, it's funny. I mean, it's not really funny, but I, I almost, thanks. Uh-huh. Well. Yes. - Peter. Be careful. - Wait, hey. - Thank you, thank you. - Dad, be careful. - If you start at that northeast corner of those four stars, that form a square, that's the great square of Pegasus. And the, you see the coming off of it, there's like a handle, that's not even our galaxy anymore. That's Andromeda, which is this whole other galaxy. It's 2.5 million light years away. Look, see. You ever wake up from a dream and it's like you're still dreaming. - Hello?
