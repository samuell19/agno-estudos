("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy") - [Adult Clara] Once upon a time, many years ago when I was a little girl, I loved to visit my Uncle Drosselmeyer. He was the best clockmaker in all the town of Mentin. Uncle Drosselmeyer and my Aunt Gerda lived in an old house that overlooked the main street. During the day, the streets of Mentin were bright and happy, but at night, when the fog silently rolled around the houses, it was said that the evil Ragman would appear. (clock chiming) (mysterious music) Aunt Gerda told me that he carried a bag over his hunched shoulders, and was looking, always looking to fill it. (mysterious pensive music) He moved through the night, searching each home. Beware the Ragman if you stay up late! Watch out! Good children were safe, Aunt Gerda said, asleep and warm beneath their blankets. They had nothing to fear. (mysterious pensive music) But look out if you're awake past bedtime. The Ragman would catch you, and when he did, she said, he would smile wickedly, point his crooked cane, and turn you into a mouse! (mysterious pensive music) (clock clicking rapidly) (upbeat pensive music) (mysterious music) (child screaming) (electrical crackling) (mouse squeaking) (tense music) It was on just such a night, when I was still a young girl, that I arrived to visit my Aunt Gerda and Uncle Drosselmeyer, and I would never be the same again. (upbeat music) The noble king, his court, and how can I forget the funny chamberlain who were childhood friends of mine? Uncle Drosselmeyer was always full of surprises, and he made many wonderful presents for me. But my favorite, and I think his too, was this puppet theater. - Clara, there's the clock. If the Ragman comes, you'd better be in bed. Besides, your puppets will be here in the morning. - I know, but Fritz is coming here tomorrow, and I can't wait. Oh, Aunt Gerda, I'm so excited, I could never sleep! (Aunt Gerda scoffs) My Fritz, I wonder how he looks now. It's been such a long time. - Uh-huh. - [Clara] I bet he's so handsome. - Remember now, people can change when they go away. Don't set your heart too much on the past, my dear. Now, you really must get some sleep. Enough dreaming, it's getting late. - My Fritz, he'll never change. You know, he'll always be the same person I remember. Just think, four years have passed. You know, I'm no longer little, and I've decided I'm not going to bed. I don't believe in the Ragman. Auntie, did you understand what I said? I'm too grown-up to believe. - [Aunt Gerda] Oh, really? - That's right, the Ragman's not real. You can't scare me anymore. - Enough of that, I want you in bed this instant. What if he came right now and caught you wide awake? (Aunt Gerda huffs) (doorknob squeaking) (mysterious music) - [Uncle Drosselmeyer] Clara? Hmm? - It's Uncle Drosselmeyer! - Oh! We thought you were the Ragman. You know better than to scare us like that. I certainly wasn't expecting you home this soon. I thought you said the mayor's clock would take you all night. - [Uncle Drosselmeyer] Yes, yes. - Ah, you did fix the mayor's clock? Answer me! - Yes, yes. - Could you fix it or not? - Ah, my dear, am I not the best clockmaker in all the town of Mentin? - Is that so? And what about our own clock downstairs, mm, my dear? - Even I will admit that there's a great challenge, but not quite impossible. - You mean our clock works now, not too fast, not too slow, but on time? I remember, last time, you said the same thing, and it never stopped chiming. - Ah, chime, chime, chime! - [Aunt Gerda] Oh! - All your aunt worries about is tick-tock, finish your work and follow the clock. - Go ahead, make fun, but there's something strange about our clock. - You may be right, my dear. Ah-ha, and here it is. Behold, the spring. I think it's all sprang, hey? (laughs) Ah, my Gerda, a strange clock? (spring clanging) Nuts! Oops! (bright music) Ah, that silly doll. - Oh, how sweet! A nutcracker, for me? - For you. You think he's cute, really? - Yes, the cutest! Oh, he is, he's precious! Can I have him? - No, no, no, no, not this doll, particularly not this doll. You can't, you couldn't want him, hmm. See how his buck teeth stick out? And the eyes, they're too huge. He really is terribly homely, you know? - [Clara] No! - What could you possibly- - Everything! Everything is just right. - Ah, well, I'm glad you like what I made. As you see, there are still many things that are wrong with him. - Wrong? Oh, Uncle! - Please listen. (clears throat) I'm an old clockmaker, but my real love is dolls. So every day, I try to make a doll that's perfect, both inside and out. You have no idea how hard that is, and how many times I've failed, my dear. Too many, too many. I've made, oh, I've made lots of dolls, so many of them, but people only want to buy beautiful dolls. What good is a doll with just a kind heart? Now, the one you have right there has a perfectly beautiful heart, and yet, something, something is just not right. - Enough talk, or you'll be exhausted tomorrow, Clara. - [Clara] But Auntie- - Fritz is coming tomorrow. Don't you want to look nice for him? Besides, I've told you a thousand times about the Ragman. (Clara giggles) Now, you may laugh, but you know what'll happen. You'll become a mouse if you're still awake. (Uncle Drosselmeyer laughs menacingly) - Poo. But please, Auntie, can't I keep the doll here? I promise, I'll go right to sleep. - [Aunt Gerda] Let the child have the doll, and no more speeches. You talk all night, no more. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, but I- - [Aunt Gerda] She needs sleep, it's late. - Please, Uncle? - You can keep the doll! Enough said. - But I only... (Clara giggles) (sighs) Ah, well, she has spoken. (Uncle Drosselmeyer shushes) Tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, tick-tock-tee, goodnight. ♪ Lilies in the night, moon shadow ♪ ♪ Knocking on the door, calling Clara ♪ ♪ Somewhere in the dark, a doll awakens ♪ ♪ To dance a dream of fantasy ♪ ♪ Palace of the princess, deeply dreaming ♪ ♪ Midnight minuet as she is sleeping ♪ ♪ Clara, take my hand, hear the music ♪ ♪ Now the dance of the dolls has begun ♪ ♪ And in the moonlight, you minuet ♪ ♪ Dancing alone in your first pirouette ♪ ♪ This is the dance of the dolls ♪ ♪ And it's all for you ♪ ♪ Clara, take my hand, hear the music ♪ ♪ Now that the dance of the dolls has begun ♪ (mice squeaking) - (gasps) What?

(mysterious music) (Clara gasps softly) (wind blowing) (door creaking) (Clara gasps) (mice squeaking) (lightning cracking) (Clara screaming) (Queen Morphia laughing) - Well, hello! My goodness, what a lovely little doll you have there. Now, if you'd just give it to us, we'll be on our way. (mice squeaking) (tense music) Oh, I wouldn't try leaving, unless you leave the doll behind. - What are we waiting for? Grab the girl and steal the doll! (mice squeaking) (tense rock music) (glass shattering) Now I think we got her! - Why don't you take a nap, dearie? (Queen Morphia growls) (Queen Morphia gasps) (mice squeaking) How dare you? Army, attack! (mice squeaking) Well? Get him! Attack! (mice squeaking) Huh? What are they waiting for? - Cowards! Get him! (mice squeaking) (dramatic orchestral music) - Clara, what's the matter? You were screaming. Is something wrong? Did you have a nightmare? Wake up. (Clara groaning) I'm worried about you, Clara. You have to wake up now, hmm? (Clara groaning) (soft bright music) - My doll. The mice took my doll! - Oh, now, Clara, ha! Mice taking your little doll. It sounds like a dream to me. (laughs) - Aunt Gerda, no! They were here, and I saw them! And I chased them too! - If you say so. - But there was a two-headed mouse and everything! - [Aunt Gerda] A two-headed mouse? (laughs weakly) - It's true! Really, Auntie, it's all true! - [Aunt Gerda] I believe you think it's true, but dreams are not what they seem to be. We mustn't let them go too far. - But you don't understand. I wasn't dreaming, because my brave nutcracker, he defended my life, Auntie. - [Aunt Gerda] Your life? - He was so very brave. If only you could have seen him fighting off all those mice with his sword. - Really! That's enough of that kind of talk, quite enough. Fritz will be here soon, young lady. Hadn't you better hurry? Come now, Clara, we haven't much time. I thought you couldn't wait to see Fritz. - Fritz? Oh, my head hurts. - Your head? Are you ill, dear? I'll bet you had too much excitement, that's all. Oh my, you're burning up. Here, lie down. Keep the covers up to your chin. Now, I'm going to send for the doctor. (birds chirping) (mysterious pensive music) (Queen Morphia laughing) - Was it? Could it all have been real? (warm pensive music) - [Adult Clara] It was so long ago, but I remember that I fell asleep. My head hurt terribly. Images began to spin in my mind. One question kept repeating itself. Where was my nutcracker doll? Where was my nutcracker? Suddenly, I found myself downstairs, standing all alone before Uncle Drosselmeyer's grandfather clock. (mysterious pensive music) (Clara gasps) (glass shattering) (tense mysterious music) (clock chiming and ticking rapidly) (mouse squeaking) - I'm here, I know I'm awake. How can I know what to believe? Is someone there? Uncle Drosselmeyer! (mysterious upbeat music) What are you doing in there?

(soft warm music) (Clara gasps) Why, she looks like me! (soft warm music) (water splashing) Oh! (soft warm music) - [Adult Clara] I found myself in a very strange room. Could it belong to the girl in the picture? And such a lovely room, but so strangely quiet. (thunder cracking) (Clara gasping) - Princess, Princess Mary! - Oh! Oh! - My daughter, Mary! - Mary? - The curse is broken! - What curse? I'm not your daughter Mary. - Of course you are, my dear. Oh, you're free at last. You're my little girl once again. I was sure that you were lost to me forever. (crying) - But my name is Clara. Please, sir, I'm not your daughter. - What? Chamberlain, what is the meaning of this? - Oh, Your (stammering) Majesty, I don't know what to think. (chamberlain sobbing) Dear, no. (King Goodwin groaning) (pensive music) Oh, no! Don't faint! Please! (groaning nervously) - You told me your name is Clara, but as you see, you look exactly like my lovely daughter Mary. - [Clara] I know. I'm sorry I made you sad. Please tell me what happened to Mary. - All right, if I must, (sighs deeply) but it's a sad, sad story, isn't it, Chamberlain? - Yes, it was that wicked, wicked two-headed Queen Morphia who did it to us. (crying) - Did you say two-headed? (thunder cracking) (tense music) - You've met the wicked two-headed Queen Morphia? And you survived? Fantastic. We were not so lucky, Clara. To begin the story, I should tell you that my kingdom of the dolls was happy and peaceful, (chamberlain whimpering) till that fateful day when Morphia and her mice took over. After that, we had no choice but to declare war and attack the queen. It's an awful thing to send the dolls into battle. (sighs deeply) So my army fought. But you see, my soldiers are run by springs, and springs unwind. (sighs) In the end, my captain of the guard, Franz, could do no better than protect the princess and my pitiful self. - Yes, yes, yes, yes! (groans) Disaster. We were so badly beaten. - What else could we do but surrender? We signed the papers, but that was not enough for Queen Morphia. She ordered my darling daughter to be married to her despicable son Gar. - (sobbing) Yes. - My only daughter married to that evil Gar. No, by my eyes, and she punished me by casting a spell on my darling. Her dark power changed my lovely daughter Mary into that ugly sleeping mouse you saw! - How terribly sad. (tense music) (chamberlain sobbing) - Your Majesty. (bright orchestral music) (chamberlain sobbing) Sire. - Huh? Oh, dear Franz. Will the wisemen be here soon? - Yes, preparations are made. The wisemen will be arriving tomorrow. They have come from all over the world to help us. - I'm pleased. We must trust that so much wisdom will break Queen Morphia's evil spell. (drums beating rapidly) - Negatively negative. I would describe your ideas further, but in my country, cows and their many products are sacred. Oh, (speaking in foreign language) holy mystic of the Far East, kindly release Princess Mary from her unfortunate and rather ugly dilemma. Arise, oh, great Mongoosa. Transform yourself into the king of snakes. (crowd gasping and yelling) Gentlemen, ladies, do not be alarmed. The Maharajah does not bite too often. - Cobra bites not good. - Not often, not often. - Silly cobra snake no good. Feline good. Ah, not usual cat, no, but cat-cat is bargain, so. (people chattering) Ah, riveting offer this week only. Cat-cat break mouse spell when eat mouse, Boy Scout honor. Offer void where prohibited. Cat-cat (indistinct) in east. Oh, none better. (people chattering) Oh, ee, no, no, no! (people yelling and gasping) - (indistinct) Made In Hong Kong. We must address the problem intelligently. Now, I, Otto Von'Atra, crooner of Europe, will sing my (indistinct). My golden voice will quickly swoon the spell away. (Otto singing indistinctly) For my second hit... - Hey, hey! Pay attention to me, my little comrades. Boris O'Boris has five-year plan to awaken princess, five measly years, hey, hey! Five years, that's all. Hey! Hey, comrade? If not five, then 10, 15 max. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Your Majesty, Your Majesty, lend me your ear. I have written a rhyme to wake up your dear. Oh, roses, roses, roses so red, violets, violets, violets so purple. Sugar is sweet, and so is maple syrple. (audience applauding) Oh, princess dear, oh, do not fear, your rhymer, Gambino is here, is here. Oh, worry not about that spell, my poem sends all the mice to (clears throat), well. This poem is a lion, this poem is a bear, it's simple, simple, like walking on air. - Magic is the only way to fight magic. Here's something I picked up while plundering Europe. It can change the ugly princess back into her normal self. Assistant, the pigeon, please. To prove my magic, I will change this pigeon into a, a lovely swan. Abracadabra, swan appear. (fabric ripping) Oops! (audience laughing) ♪ Way down upon the Swanee River ♪ - Poppycock, Your Majesty! Such things as snakes, songs, sonnets, and spells should be left to science. Solutions are my cup of tea, your great majesty. Solutions and answers, and wonderful beakers of similar things. (speaking in foreign language) Problems are problems to all men but me, I mix and I burn a solution or three. (bright orchestral music) (chemical blasting) (audience chattering) (coughing) If only I knew the problem, you see. - [Executioner] Whee, here, here! I'm here to save the princess. Off with heads, off with heads! That's the solution to the problem, Governor, any problem. (people chattering) But I faint at the sight of blood. Whee! - Only I, having read the ancient scrolls and books, and the "Arabian Nights" itself, can awake King Goodwin's daughter with a kiss. - Wha? (people chattering) - A tender kiss, a little smooch, a small smack. (drums beating) (Indian Wiseman groaning) (Indian Wiseman smooching) (people chattering) ("Tea - Chinese Dance") (balloons popping) - [Wiseman] You are terrible, terrible, terrible! All of... (Indian Wiseman smooching) ("Tea - Chinese Dance") (people chattering) - Let's have order, please, please! Yes? Oh, no, stop it! (people chattering) If you be wisemen, you have to stop this. - How 'bout me? From the wee highlands of Scotland to the shores of Tripoli, (hiccups) only one name is known, and he is me, Clovis the errant knight, at your service. (hiccups) Letters, telegrams, packages, notes, (hiccups) give them to me. Communication to Morphia is the key, you see. Have some tea. - No, no, science is the key. I have the solution, solutions are my specialty. Stop, everyone! - Where's the snake? The snake, he's loose, he's loose! My cobra is loose! - Cat-cat number one, number one. - Five-year plan, comrades. I have orders from the Kremlin. Five-year plan, I said. - I will bring to the world disorder! - Solutions (indistinct). - Cat-cat! (people chattering) - [Boris] Your stupid cat, send it to Siberia. - Have some tea? - Poetry! (chamberlain groaning frustratedly) (mice squeaking) (people chattering) (upbeat music) - [Executioner] Whee! (people chattering) - There is no hope. What is to become of my poor sleeping darling now? Must she be a mouse forever? (melancholic pensive music) (King Goodwin groaning sadly) (King Goodwin groaning sadly) (weather vane creaking) (crickets chirping) - [Adult Clara] Poor King Goodwin. I felt so sorry for him and the princess. If the wisemen couldn't help them, then who could? I wandered dark streets that led me ever deeper into the night.

Are you looking for someone? Is there something wrong? - Yes. Queen Morphia cast a spell on Princess Mary. Wisemen from all over the world came, but they thought only of themselves, and never tried to help. Do you know of some way to help the princess? - [Street Singer] Hmm, I'm not a wiseman. It's difficult to say. Wait! Where are you going? There is a person who might be of help, a gypsy fortune teller who lives over that way, somewhere. It is said she sees things others cannot. If you want to help the princess, the gypsy may be the one you seek. When you find her door, just say, "Queen of Time." Now, follow the yellow-beaked bird. (bird cawing) - Thank you so much. Goodbye! (warm pensive guitar music) (bird cawing) (Clara gasps) (bird cawing) (skull roaring) Hello? (clears throat) Queen of Time? (door creaking) (soft bright music) Are you the Queen of Time? - I am called that. - Please, can you... - [Queen Of Time] Yes? - Can you help me? I was told to come here. - Do you think I can help? - Oh, I hope you can help. You're the Queen of Time, and you must know all. Oh, don't you? - [Queen Of Time] Maybe. - Oh. - Yes? - It's just, I, I have nothing to give you. - (laughs softly) Your kind heart more than repays me. But what you seek is not mine alone to give. Remember that. - I will, but please, can you tell me how the spell can be broken? - Ah, come closer. (soft bright music) (Queen of Time chanting mysteriously) Appear! (Queen of Time chanting mysteriously) Oh, wicked spell, take us to your maker. Down, down, down, down into the kingdom of the mice. Oh. (chanting mysteriously) (Clara gasps) - Ah, isn't war wonderful? More gold than mice can spend, more food than mice can eat! (Gar sighing happily) Drink, enjoy yourself, my dearest and only son, Gar. Drink up! (Gar growling) - Moms, you put a real bad spell on her, and I want her. - Have patience. Very soon now, (laughs) the king will give in, and we'll lift the spell and she's yours. - Our power is secret. No one will ever find out. (laughs) (Gar smooching) Now, now, now, Gar. Wait, I feel someone! Who's there? (Queen Morphia growling) (Queen of Time chanting mysteriously) (bat squeaking) - Show me more of your secret power. (Queen Morphia laughing) Show me. Show me. (Queen Morphia laughing) The giant Shell of Darkness! So, that's it. - The giant Shell of Darkness? - It is Queen Morphia's heart, covered by a hard shell. Evil hearts always need protection. Inside is her power. Show me, show me, show me the way to crack the Shell of Darkness. Ah, the pearls. - [Clara] Pearls? - [Queen Of Time] Mm-hmm, yes, the Pearl Sword of Light. - I don't understand. (mysterious music) - This sword will crack the shell, but remember, it must be used by a person with a good heart. - The Shell of Darkness? - Yes, and when you crack it, the princess will be released, and Queen Morphia will be destroyed, forever and ever. - Clara, what you ask is impossible. That shell is harder than steel. - But the Queen of Time said this Sword of Pearl can crack it. - Ah, truly? This can save the princesS? I'll use it. Yes, there is hope. - Then you must go back to war? - What choice do we have? We must fight, and this time, we must win, or die in the attempt. - Please, Franz, be careful, and know that my heart goes with you too. (warm music) - I know. Goodbye. (warm music) (drums beating rapidly) - [Soldier With Large Mustache] First division ready to be wound, sir. - [Redheaded Soldier] Second division ready to be wound, sir. - [Franz] Wind the troops! (drums beating) (keys clicking) (energetic music) - [Soldier With Large Mustache] First division ready, sir. - [Redheaded Soldier] Second division ready, sir. - [Franz] Troops ready, Your Majesty. (drums beating) (energetic music) Prepare to move out! - Ready! - Ready! - [Redheaded Soldier] Ready! - [Franz] Shoulder, arm! - [Redheaded Soldier] Forward march! (energetic music) (keys clicking) - Remember, we are all counting on you. The Shell of Darkness must be destroyed. (energetic music) (keys clicking) If Princess Mary is released from Queen Morphia's spell, I will give you her hand in marriage. (energetic music) - [Adult Clara] I knew King Goodwin was sad at heart as his troops marched off to war. Oh, if Franz can only crack the Shell of Darkness with the Pearl Sword, I thought, then they might have a chance. But what if he can't? What if the surprise attack doesn't work? (mice chattering) (upbeat music) (mice squeaking) (drums beating) (keys clicking) (mice chattering) (upbeat music) - Cheers! (glasses clinking) (mice chattering) (upbeat music) - More wine!

(tense music) (mice squeaking) (mouse laughing menacingly) (canon blasting) (thunder cracking) (mice laughing) (canon blasting) - [Mouse] Come on! (energetic music) (canon blasting) - [Mouse] Ready? Fire! Fire, fire! (soldiers clattering dramatically) Strike! Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! (mouse yelling) - Fire! - Fire! - [Mouse] Fire!

Huh? Where'd they go? Hey! Come back here, fight! (redheaded soldier yelling) (ground rumbling) - Their springs are running down! - Charge!

(mice squeaking) (cat mewing) Let him get Franz! - [Mouse] No, cat, no! (Queen Morphia growling) (canon blasting) (mice squeaking and chattering) - [Mouse] Get Franz, you stupid cat, not me! (cat screeching) (tense energetic music) - Franz, Franz! - Oh, no, he's got the Sword of Pearls! (Queen Morphia screaming) Curse you! Curse you, Franz! - You shall become a nutcracker forever! - Cursed! - Forever! I'm dying! Dying!

(bright orchestral music) (people chattering) - Oh my, how lovely! I missed you so. - Father dear. - My Mary, I thought I'd never see you again. - King Goodwin, ah, my king, the party's prepared now. - Oh, good! Come, let us celebrate the joy that is within our hearts! (people chattering) - Come, come, everyone. We should all retire to the ballroom. Oh, there'll be music and dancing. Oh, I do love dancing. (chamberlain humming) (bright orchestral music) - Mary, you know, we owe so much to Franz's bravery, and I have promised him your hand in marriage. - Really? Oh, Father! Thank you, but where is he? - Franz! Franz, my boy! Where are you? That's strange, where could he be? Chamberlain, why isn't Franz here? - [Chamberlain] Your Majesty, I don't know! - Has anybody seen Franz? Speak up, please, right now. - [Clara] Your Highness! He's here. - [Party Guest] Oh, it can't be. - He's been turned into this nutcracker doll. Queen Morphia cast a spell on him. (party guests groaning sadly) Franz sacrificed himself to save your kingdom, for evil Queen Morphia, she put a curse on him. - (gasps) Franz? - It's true. - What is this girl saying? This doll can't be my husband-to-be. - Oh, oh, it is true. - No, I won't marry a homely doll! - Oh, but Princess, you shouldn't feel that way. He gave everything he had to save you from the spell. - Well then, dear, why don't you marry him? Here, look, he's just a piece of wood. If you want him, take him. I'm way too pretty to marry that. Everyone, let's forget all this. Really, enough sad stories. Besides, isn't your princess worth a celebration? Come, let's go and start the party. (people chattering) Come on, come on, Father. - Uh, oh, uh... - Forget her and that silly doll. - [King Goodwin] (sighs) Yes, dear. (melancholic pensive music) - Oh, Franz. (melancholic pensive music) My dear doll. (melancholic pensive music) (energetic orchestral music) (people chattering) (Scottish Wiseman smooching loudly) - [Adult Clara] Discouraged and alone, I felt that the Queen of Time was the only friend I had left. (Gar snarling) - [Queen Of Time] You've come about Franz? - Please help. - [Queen Of Time] Only you can help Franz. - Me? - [Queen Of Time] Only you. - Oh, but where can I look to find the answer? - Clara, the answer is within you, inside you. - Inside me? - Yes, my child.

Can't you hear me? What's wrong? Why won't you answer me? Have I said something to make you angry? I only wanna help free Franz from the spell and find my way back home. Why won't you help me? - (laughs) You might as well question the trees, my dear. Puppets only do what I want them to do. They're wood, through and through. See the strings? - I'm Clara. Who are you? - Why, the Puppeteer! The only Puppeteer. - Really? Well, maybe you're the one who can help me. - Ah, could be, I'm a great helper and my solutions are free, see? But there are no guarantees. (crickets chirping) Ah, what a cute little nutcracker. It's under a spell, isn't it? A nasty spell, hmm? - [Clara] How did you know? - Well, I couldn't possibly guarantee the work, you know, unless, unless... - Unless? Unless what? Can't you help? - Maybe, maybe, unless it's Morphia's. - It is. - [Puppeteer] Oh. - What can you do for my poor doll? - Well, well, if Morphia did cast the spell, then I positively can guarantee that there is nothing I can do for you. - [Clara] Oh. - Only the Timekeeper has the answers that you seek, a tiny man with only one eye. Just keep looking. - [Clara] Thank you. - [Puppeteer] The Timekeeper doesn't give guarantees either, and that's a promise! (pensive music) - Time, time, time. - [Clara] Are you the Timekeeper? - Hey? Ah! So there ya are. I've been waiting for you, Clara. I knew you wouldn't give up until you found me. - Then you know about- - Aye. - Franz. - [Timekeeper] Aye. - I was told that only I could save him from the curse. - Aye, lass, with love, love. - [Clara] Love? - That's what we've been trying to tell you. But there's more to love. Ah, Morphia, her dying spell was very strong. - Then there's nothing you can do for him. Nothing. - Of course I can help you, my dear. Trust me. The real key's in your heart, Clara, in yourself. Remember that. But don't be fooled. Your heart must know, know that your love is very real and true. - But I do love him, really! - Mm, completely? - [Clara] Yes! - But true love means sacrifice. - I see. So that's the key. But what can I do? - [Timekeeper] True love cannot stay inside. It always shows itself. Only true love can save Franz. You must make a sacrifice for him as great as the one he made. Real loves are not like the puppets in the forest, because true love has no strings attached. Look deep into your heart, Clara. Do you really love Franz that much? (warm orchestral music) ("In the Pine Forest") (dreamy music) ("Nutcracker Suite Medley") - Welcome, Clara, to the land of happy times. ("Nutcracker Suite Medley") Look, Clara, there's the Palace of Happiness. From now on, it will be our palace. ("Nutcracker Suite Medley") (bright warm music) - Welcome, Clara and Franz. Welcome to the Palace of Happiness. It is yours forever and ever. (soft warm music) - [Uncle Drosselmeyer] True love means sacrifice, Clara. Have you sacrificed for Franz? - Uncle Droselmeyer! But what do you mean? Oh, my foot. I can't move my feet. Franz, please don't go! Franz! I won't let you go! Franz! I won't let you go! (Gar snarling) Sacrifice? (Gar snarling) (gasps) No! - Give it back! (growls) Give him here! - Leave him alone! He's mine! I'll never let you have him! - I want revenge! Franz dared to kill my mother and destroy her power! (growls) Franz must die! (Clara yelps) He will die! (snarling) - No, don't hurt him! You get away from him! Isn't your mother's curse on him enough? Can't you just forgive him? - No! I'll never forgive Franz, never! - No, don't hurt him, no! (Gar groaning) No, no! Take me instead! - [Gar] Huh? - I said if you spare him, I'll give my life. - What? - Please, I truly love him with all my heart. - You stupid fool! - No! I'll save you Franz! (Gar snarling) I love you! (thunder cracking) (Gar screaming) (warm orchestral music) - [Adult Clara] I started falling, falling, falling without end. Where was my nutcracker? I felt so dizzy. Oh, how I wanted Franz. And where was Uncle Drosselmeyer and Aunt Gerda? I heard myself call out, "Franz! "Uncle Drosselmeyer! Franz! "Uncle Drosselmeyer. Aunt Gerda! "Franz?" - Uncle Drosselmeyer. - "Uncle Drosselmeyer." - Aunt Gerda! Franz! Uncle Drosselmeyer! Aunt Gerda! (soft bright music) Uncle Drosselmeyer! - Oh, dear Clara, are you feeling better now? - [Clara] Yes. - Your Uncle Drosselmeyer and I have been terribly worried. You've had a fever. Are you listening to me? You were having nightmares. - Aunt Gerda? Am I really here? Was it only a dream? - Everyone dreams. You mustn't worry about it. Besides, there's someone else who's waiting to see you. He's been so worried. I'll show him in right now. - Oh, someone's waiting? - [Aunt Gerda] Fritz is waiting. (warm music) - Franz? Can it be? (Clara gasps) (warm music) - [Uncle Drosselmeyer] You know, Clara. - [Clara] Yes, Uncle Drosselmeyer? - [Uncle Drosselmeyer] Dreams can come true. - Hello, Clara, it's been a long time. These flowers, they're not nice enough for someone pretty as a princess.
