Yeah, well, uh, it was pretty good fun in the middle of the race, right? Oh, yeah. Especially when Jumbo slipped - and fell flat in his face. - Yeah. You know, Kyle's a pretty good guy. Yeah, he's a-- he's a decent guy. You like him. I had a-- I had a run in God, it was so funny. That guy, he has it. Oh, yeah. Gonna have a piss. Coming for a piss? No. No. I don't wanna. I'm gonna leave coming soon. Where are you going to? I'll go home to see Mom. What was that? David, let's go see. I'll kill him if he's crapping around with us again. A report has just come through of another soldier being stabbed to death tonight. A police spokesman said there is no apparent link between this death and the previous soldier. It must be a madman. Today, in parliament, the Minister of the Interior and the Chief of Police defended the police forces' investigation. They are being harshly criticized for their handling of the murders. The first case was reported two months ago. After finding the mutilated bodies of two murdered soldiers, the police asked the utmost caution from the public, and in particular, all new recruits. Can I help you, sir? What time do you close? We closed 10 minutes ago. Yeah? A beer would be nice. One beer for over there. You take it for me, would you? Hold it there. I'm not finished. Maybe I should wait. Hmm. Hey, hold it. This isn't a war. -Huh? -Go easy. Hi. Sun shining. What time do you close? What? What time do you close? We closed 10 minutes ago. Well, I think coffee would be nice. Don't tell me your name though. Let me look in the coffee, I'll tell you what your name is. Place your hand over the cup. Okay. I see... a forest in there. There's animals running around. Look at the lion. Prowling there. He sees or heard a deer by the river. They begin to panic. But the lion doesn't move because he doesn't want the swift from all the slow one which is his doe. That's a special doe he's going to eat. He's Iris. How did you know my name? A coffee got powers. Don't you believe a word of it. I heard the waitress call you Iris. Here's the bus. I'll give you a call later. Hey. Hey. Where are you going? I have to go in. What do you mean have to? - Got a pass? - No, I don't. And you think you can go in? I always do. They know me. It don't matter. Without identification, no one gets past. Well, can I use the phone? There's no one uses this phone but me, get it? Don't try giving them a buzz. But it won't help any. When you gotta have identification. Just ask for Orna. Orna. Yeah, there's no reply. I can't get through. How long do I have to wait here? You wait until I let you through or you drive back where you came from. Hello? Hello? Is that Orna? Some guy here without a pass. He says that he usually gets through without a pass. Yeah. He's got a car. What's your name, huh? - Ze'ev. - Ze'ev - Ze'ev. - Ze'ev oh, okay, I didn't know. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, then.

Call me anytime. - Hello. - Hi. Looking for something special? No, I just wanna look around. The shop is yours. As you see, we got everything. Are you sure I can't help you? -Have you any uniforms? -Sure. Really, I got uniforms of all kind. Over here, there. What about these here? No, no. They don't come in your size. No. What's this? This? That's that's some legionnaire hats. No, no. I don't want a hat. Any special one in mind? Something modern I say, you got a power outfit? Sure. I got the full dress here. All field uniform. Well, just show me what you got. Now then, if it's some Halloween party, best make it dress. They're still packed up there in the box. However, if you needed for the reserves, I'd suggest you take the field uniform and it's better value as well. This one will do. It's almost new as you see and I've got the badge with a pair of wings and then there's the pants that go with it and you'd like the belt just to finish it off? No. Just two of these will do. -They'll fit okay. -Very good. -And then what about a kit bag?-No. Oh, listen for this, boy. When I was in the army, there was a guy in my quarters and somebody stole the guy's kit bag. And so as a punishment, he was sentenced to the court. He couldn't take it, he went to Beezer's. Finally, he blew his brains out. Don't ever blow your brains outwith a bullet, huh? Just come and see Alex. It'll be $20. If you wanna have a receipt, I must have the text. No, no, just don't bother. Here. -That's fine. -$20. I'll take them like this. Remember now, don't worry. If you ever lose your rifleor something one of these days, I'll crack up a Zucca. Come and see Alex. You'll see all right. Okay. Bye now. Come again. Sorry, I'm late, Iris. I couldn't park the car. It's a shame. The movie's started already. That's no problem. Stand over here a minute. You got the tickets here? It's all right. Aren't we going in? It'll be okay. Just stand here a minute. Hey, you! Come here! I wanna see your tickets! Come on, this way. Hey, what's up? Can we watch for a minute? Why? Ain't you got money for tickets? Well, you know how it is. Ah, go ahead. It's all yours. Go on. -You sure we won't bother you? -Me? I won't bother you and you won't bother me. Thanks, pal. They know you're a gangster. It's a great trace. There. Oh, thanks. Yeah. He really got screwed. Wait, what do you mean screwed? He's lucky he's not at the front. Oh, all the girls he wants? He's a real good fighter. Hey, you see the riflethat the had on him when he came at us, huh? Oh, yeah,but he got to blew his head off. Ah, he had it coming. And I wish I had it. Hey, how could it be a he wasn't there. Hey, words don't matter. When you're going senile, a was in that action. I got it marked myself, I should know. No, I was in the attack as well. Yeah, sure, no, I saw him, I saw him. He dragged-- he dragged this wounded guy out of-- Yeah? --yeah, out the car. yeah, yeah yeah. I saw him do it. Man, I remember that Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I happen to be there. You deserve a medal, I tell you. Oh, it took more than three. If only I was able to carry it up myself. You were a hero, I tell you. Iris. I didn't see you come in. I met your boss today. I was just passing, so I went to see him. What? You had mentioned it was a business discussion. I decided to open a business. What kind of business are you talking about? I was thinking of opening a place that sells good coffee. I don't get it. Why do you wanna open a cafe? Gonna buy the placewhere I'll be able to fire you. From then on, it's only me you serve... with delicious coffee all day. There's no need to fire meif all you want is your coffee. You know, this is really a strange place. You... you've got nothing personal around you. It's not like a home. When I was little, dad put up a tent for me in my room. I ate all my meals there. I slept in it. I really like being in it. Never had pictures, or books, or wants personal things. I don't need them, you see? Too bad. I love my own things. Can't get along without them. What about the military? Are they in the picture? Uh, yes, of course. Uh, two of their top men are working with us in our special investigation team. What line is the investigation following? To begin with, we thought it was some Palestinian extremist group like Black September. Later, the inquiry sent it on the possibility of, uh, one of our own extremist groups. Religious, some fanatical sect or, uh, political. And at the moment, we think, uh, perhaps it's a VAT of organized crime. Organized crime? Why should that be? Because, uh, the underworld, uh, obtains many of its weapons from the army. Uh, personally. I myself believe that we're dealing with terrorists, like for instance, the Red Brigade or, the gang. Then there's a similarity to the killings of police officers in the United States, Great Britain, and Spain. But here, it's the case of soldiers - in our army. - That's right. Iris. Look there. Look, there's a fish. Where? There. Okay. You stay here and watch. Bull's-eye. What's the matter now? I don't want them to see me with this. I got no license. What do you need a license for? Should have them for the rifle. It's only an air gunthat I picked up from somewhere. Look, come on, I wanna show you something. Take a look at this well here. Wow, wow. Isn't it deep? Yeah. Come, come. Come and look. I don't like it. Come along. Don't be scared. Listen to this. Hey. Boo. I wanna see how high we are. Zev, Zev, stop it. What are you afraid of? It only takes a little guts. Look here, Iris. Guts are something you can develop. All you need is self-confidence. Take my word for it. You'll do it in time. I do exercise it to help me. I'll show you. I want you to try something. You just take two steps forward. You'll soon overcome your fear. Zev, don't. No. That-- that's it. Don't be afraid. -There. -Zev, please. No. -I don't like it.-But you'll see if you just try. Don't be afraid. You'll see. Enough, Zev. I'm scared. -Let go. Let go. -You'll conquer your fear. Try it. Iris, stay still. You'll see. You can overcome this fear of yours. -I don't want to.-There's nothing to worry about. Just let me tie you up for a minute. You'll take two steps forward. -Just try. -No, enough. Try for a second. Iris. It's okay. I was only kidding. I didn't-- I didn't mean it, Iris. Iris... listen. I was kidding. I didn't mean it. Have you any more lessons to do? That's all we had. Can I go out? You got half an hour before tea. Now, don't be late for it. Okay. And don't forget to change your shoes. -See you. -See you. Something's worrying you. Yeah. There's a secret. Can't you tell me? He's got guns. I was wondering at night. Strange. Wait a second. You passed on that message to her? Zev, Zev. Oh, Zev now, please. You talk all day. Now, come on. Put that phone down. I need a hand with these. What is it with you? Isn't Iris there? No. She's got to be there. Are you sure she got the message? She was to call me as she got in. No, she didn't call. No, she didn't. But are you sure that you told her? No, she didn't. She didn't call me yesterday. That's not possible. I just called up the coffee shop who said she went to the library first. I'll find you-- shit. There's your guy. I'll leave you. There's no need for you to run away. Two is company. Iris, come outside. I wanna talk. I have nothing to say to you. Just for a minute, I wanna talk. Iris, what is it? Iris, what is wrong? You know I'm stubborn. I won't give up. Zev, it won't help you. Iris. Iris, stop. Iris, I will not... Wait. Iris, now please, listen. Why didn't you call me back? You must have known I telephoned. Why not? Iris. Wait a minute. Listen, I wanna give you something. Why are you giving me this key? For the apartment. I want you to have it. Woo-hoo. Iris. Woo-hoo. Woo-hoo. Iris. I heard you there. - Hello. - Hello. Is the young man who lives here at home? We're selling some lottery tickets. I wondered if you'd like to buy some? Look, lady, we don't have anything. Just get out. Oh. I asked you not to open the door. I know, but I thought it was you. But I said not to open the doorto anybody. Lousy neighbors always prying into other people's business. When I want in, I got my own key. Come on, let's eat. Let's eat. Don't be mad at me. Well, okay. I'll forget it. No one has ever to get in to this place. You are my only visitor here. Okay? What's up? You're still angry? I'm scared. Of what? When you were out this morning, I wanted some matches. So I opened the drawer and then I saw the gun and bullets. What are they for? Iris, listen, I'm in the Army, you see? Special Force. Special Force. Very often I'm on secret missions and nobody knows. I've got to obey orders. I'm sorry but I guess I should have told you this before. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. - Come here. - Hmm, I wanna take a shower first. You don't have to. Come here. Your skin smells are fire. It's lovely. It reminds me of winter. Hmm. So glad you made it. I thought you weren't coming. That darn garage kept me waiting. Did you get the drinks? Yeah. Ice cold water, a thermos full. I made some sandwiches too. -Good. -Iris. Great. Oh, Ramy. How are things? Just fine. You still working - at the same place? - Yeah. I just wanna be with, you know, my friends. Why all these guys not me? We're going on a picnic. This is Zev. Zev meet Ramy, an old friend. -Good to meet you, Ramy. -Hi. Have we met somewhere before? Where'd you go to school? A medical student, hmm. No. Army service. Aren't you with Excuse us, we must go. - See you. - Oh yeah, so long. Hi. Hi. I'll be with you in a second. Are the swimsuits with you? Uh-hmm. Zev? Hi there, Mickey. What's up, you've been in hiding? Didn't you realize that everybody's been looking for you? What do you mean? Your father's about off his mind, he told me if I saw you to take you right over there. Well, tell him that I'm just fine. Iris, are you ready? Hey, hold it Zev, at least you could give me your number. I ain't on the phone. Can't you give your phone number at the store where you work? Why, sure, give me that. Okay. Good, write it down for me. Thanks. See you. Good luck. -Why did you make me do that? -Ow, Zev, -you're hurting me. -Listen. You shouldn't have done it. This is very important. -What's wrong, what did I do? -Now, will you listen Iris, I told you what happened when I went into the army. You must see,though I joined with my friends, no one knew I was specially trained. It's top secret. You see, I'm committed to obey special orders, whenever the order comes through. It's forbidden to tell a person about it, not even my father. Nobody knows what I do or where I live. The fact I took you to my apartment was totally against orders. I'm not allowed to bring anyone there, -understand? -Yeah. Zev, I'm really sorry, I didn't know. Now listen, the army is a small community. We know everybody. Now my work is top secret. I got to be on my guard. So my job in the store is nothing but a cover up, you see. I have to be both alert and secretive. I am always changing my apartments and continually kept on the move. You saw for yourself, in my drawer. I've got a big choice of ID cards. This is all part of my work, you see? You watch television most days,don't you? We live in the midst of war, surrounded by enemies who will blow us to pieces. We have got at all times to be on our guard, understand? Iris, you've got to help me. When's your next assignment? Don't know. Maybe tomorrow. How do they let know when it is? They never say when. I decide for myself. Zev. -Hmm? -I surrender. -You're not going in. -I wanna go with the others. -This way. -Why not? -They're my friends. -I can't explain now. You'll get it in the mail, just take it easy. -No, you can't. -No, I'm going. -Easy, damn it. -Why not me? -You'll find out eventually. -I don't understand. -I wanna go with all the others.-That's enough. Now please, come along. Oh shit. No, no! No! No! Help! Murder! Murder! Excuse me, can you hurry? I have an urgent call to make. Okay. Ah, yes. Hello? Hello? Zev? No. Didn't come in today. No, no message. Sorry but it's impossible to say. So long. That's 50, sir. Come here, what are you afraid of? -What do you want? -I'm looking for my son, Zev. -Where's he gone? -I don't know. I don't know where he is. The committee has postponed his hearing for another week. Give him this telephone number. -Tell him to ring me there. -Okay. I have your word now. Don't forget. I'm depending on you. Just stand over here a second. Tell me if anyone is coming. What are you doing? Do you know whose car this is? Zev. Get in. Get in. One beep, just beep, been out of maneuvers in the desert. I decided to take a few weeks off, I needed to rest. Just a break so I could listen to some music, read a little. Here's your coffee. This place is yours then? No, it belongs to a friend of mine, Mickey. He used to be in the army. But at the moment he's in South Africa, business trip. Is this dangerous? Oh, it's one of his pets. If I were you, I wouldn't open it. You know, son, she's real nice, show her around, just wait the night, why don't you drop in? We're throwing a party. -Yeah. Maybe. -Mickey is coming home. Now listen to me, I wanted to have a word with youabout your appeal. You can't keep appealing every year. They could take you in and give you a desk job. No, dad. I wouldn't want that. Terrorists killed five night shift workers at the power station. They planted an explosive device near the entrance to the central control room. The group claiming responsibility appeared to be the provisional IRA. Now the latest report on the mysterious soldier murders. A special investigation working on the soldier murders now suspect that the murderer maybe a soldier himself. New evidence pieced together with that of previous findings point to the fact that the murderer wears a uniform. Also, the suspect has been seemed wearing a military ID. The new head of investigation squad has arranged to hold an emergency press meeting tomorrow. The police are appealing to motorists to avoid picking up any lone soldiers in uniform. Military police are advising all uniformed men to be sure to stay in groups should they go out by night. According to our foreign office correspondent in Paris, the eight gun men holding hostages at the airport... -Hello, my dear. -Hi. Where's Zev? He's not with me. I came alone. Come on. Come on. Have something to drink. I'll look after you. I'm alone myself. -What do you like? -No, thank you. I don't want anything. There's something I wanted to ask you. I'm worried. It's Zev, you know, he keeps a gun. -He says that he's... -Well, so? Why shouldn't he? Most everybody keeps a gun around here, whether they have a license for it or not. So he got himself a gun. For a laugh. I don't understand. The medicine man refused to let the lad come hunting. Hmm. What's that supposed to mean? Look, there's blood. You're hurt. No, it's nothing. What do you think you're doing with that? Playing a game. Iris, that's not a toy. Give it to me. I said it's not a toy. Give it to me. - Now give me that. - No. That belongs to me. Give it to me. This isn't a game. Who do you think you are, a soldier? Let-let go of me. Give it to me. You haven't got the strength. Come here. I don't want you to touch my gun. Don't you touch my uniforms. Come here. I could kill you for this. If you ever put on my uniforms again. Do you hear me? Never do it. I'll kill you. Iris, are you angry? Iris, I know that I've behaved badly last night. Iris, believe me, there's two things that matter to me, the army and you. I know the truth now. Zev, you're not in the army. What are you saying? -Not in the army? -No, Zev. But who told you that? The balding friend you got? - No. - It was him. That four-eyed guy with the glasses. No, Zev. I went to see your father. He told me. So dad's been talking? Who-- what does he know about me? Maybe you can tell me, huh? Nobody. Nobody knows about the things I do. He couldn't possibly know a thing about it. Why, my business is a secret. Not even in his wildest dreams could he know. No, not he. What is he? That's a lie for sure. He's been nothing but a quartermaster all his life. But good-good for laughs, see? Laughs. If you-- but no, you wouldn't believe it. But what I do at night, he's wished he could do it. All his life. It's for people like you and him I put my life in danger each night. What I do out there at night, that's something you don't appreciate. Not in the army, huh? Yes, I am in the army. Like everybody, see? A real soldier. A soldier. Believe me, a soldier. A soldier, you hear? Tell me. Why can't you let me? Impossible. I can't. The board read the appeal you sent in. It was seriously considered. However, the decision is the same. I can't run around? I can't shoot a gun? I can't throw a bomb? Why me alone? Because of this defect in my spleen. They won't accept me? Don't you understand? The army is my life. It's too risky. But where's the risk? All my friends were accepted. Listen, Zev. You're different from your friends. If I take care, surely you will... Now look here, Zev. Accept the verdict. That's that. Zev. You mean to say you weren't accepted for anything? They want me to sit behind some desk. I won't do it.I wanna join combat or nothing. I wanna be in the commandos, not some shitty outfit. Do you think I like it? That my own son can't serve like other men? Couldn't you possibly have a word with the doctor? You know him. You could try. Zev, there's nothing I can do. Come on, you mustn't cry. Take it on the chin, huh? You're going up north? Yeah. Come on. Get in. Okay, men. Get out. -What's up? -Hey. You hear me? Get out. - What's wrong? - Just move it. -There's action. -What kind of action? Come on. Weapons at the ready. Get your weapons. We'll go into action. Take your weapons. I ordered you to take your weapons. We don't have any. Take it easy. You scared? Are you scared? Pick up your weapons. Are you scared to fight, you cowards? Fight, you cowards. Your pass? What the, come on. What's going on? Let's go see. -Come on, quick. -Hey, what was that? I don't know. Hey, soldiers. Hey. Zev? Zev? All right. Move it. Come one, grab him. -Get him. -Grab him. Move it, you bastard. Move your ass, get him in. What's the matter with you all?All right. You're all going crazy. Come on.We know what to do to with you. - That's it. - That's right. Come on, come in here. All right. Let's go now. Get in here, move it. Move your ass. Move it. All right. Get on that-- get on that. Get him on that chair. We're gonna We're gonna blow your ass off, you little twerp. Lay off I say, lay off. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. What are you? What are you, judge and jury around here? - Shut up. - Come on. Hold him here. Hold that gun, dammit. Come on. You're crazy.
