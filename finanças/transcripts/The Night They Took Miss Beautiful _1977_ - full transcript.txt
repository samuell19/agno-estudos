You tell Fingerman to come down here and direct the show, or stick it up his nose. Give me a shot of the seals, will you, Lew? Lovely, lovely, lovely, huh? [music playing] And now, ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude the talent judging, the climax of the evening, here we are with the names of the five semi-finalists of our International Miss Beautiful Pageant, who will be flown tomorrow afternoon by charted sea plane to sunny Nassau, to participate in the finals of the coveted title of "Miss Beautiful."

Not to mention the booze, huh? Here they are-- the names of the five semi fi-- finalists. Oh, uh-- Well, what happened? Where'd he go? Thank you, my dear. I'd ask you to come to my room tonight, but at my age, I can't even risk taking long naps. Ha, ha, ha. Kidding, of course. And now, the finalists. Camera three, give me a single on Cindy Lou. MARV BARKER [VOICEOVER]: --Miss Beautiful Pageant, we have the first finalist. From the land of milk and honey-- No, no, no, no, not, not faces, dummy-- give me some R & B. Camera three wants to know what R & B means. Rumps and bumps, dummy. The world's most beautiful fighting female, from Israel, Miss Reba Bar Lev. [music - "havah nagila"] ROLLY ROYCE [VOICEOVER]: Hey, get off it. Get off it, Harvey. Fingerman doesn't like that. That's what they want to see. And he's nowhere, Rolly. Get off it, Harvey. It's bad taste. Take one. And now, our next finalist, from those wonderful people who gave us Beethoven, bock beer, and weinerschnitzel, ha, ha, ha, the pride of West Germany, Miss Lillie Schaefer. [music - "deutschlandlied"] You may not have noticed this, but she has pretty eyes, too. And now, our third finalist, from the homeland of Elizabeth Taylor, The Beatles, and Twiggy, vivacious, wise-cracking Toni McDuff. [music - "rule, brittania!"] Our fourth finalist -- now remember, there are only five to be chosen. Our fourth finalist comes from sunny, lovely St. John in the Virgin Islands, shy and beautiful, Miss April Garland. [caribbean music playing] Really a credit to her race. I can't believe he actually said that. And finally, our last finalist, it fills my heart with patriotic pride, from the land of the free and the home of the brave, our own Liberty Bell-- no cracks, please-- funny? Miss Cindy Lou Barrett. Whoo! [MUSIC - "COLUMBIA, THE GEM OF THE OCEAN"] How'd you like to spend a weekend with her? Oh, I'd love it. Big Mama'd be there too, though. [music playing] [SINGING] She's the most beautiful girl in the world, and she stands with her proud flag unfurled, she's so pure, she's so fine, how I wish she were mine, the most beautiful girl in the world. Fade to black. Amen. [music playing] AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT [P.A.]: Attention. Flight 16 to Bermuda, now boarding at gate number nine. Have your boarding passes ready, please. Flight 16 to Bermuda, now boarding at gate number nine. Have your boarding passes ready, please. Cindy Lou, how many times I gotta tell you? Stop biting your nails. I'm not, Mama. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm tired. There ain't no time to be tired. We have been working for this since your first hair ribbon. I know, Mama. When I think of the things that I've done to get money for your elocution lessons, your tap lessons. Your braces. Your clothes. I know, Mama. Then try to be a little more appreciative, child. Why, I ain't need to've been working my butt off as a chaperone just so's I can be with you. I know, Mama. When you're around these people from the pageant, you've got to shine. You've got to let your beauty come pouring out of you like the sunlight. That's when they notice you. You take one of these little caffeine pills. Keep you cheerful. Sid, I'm telling you, they won't allow anybody on the air field. I don't know. Some turkey from airport security. Look, Sid. Look, look, I, I don't take that kind of talk from anybody. Oh, not for the money you're paying me, Sid. OK. OK, sorry. I'm a little hot. But cheap is cheap. I mean, that World War II sea plane-- is that the only thing we could charter? Yeah, well, I hope it can fly. That's all right, Max, we'll walk back. Wait. You can't go in there. O'Toole? Hm? Rolly Royce, Press and Publicity, Miss Beautiful Pageant. What can I do for you? It's what you're doing to me, not for me. What? I've got 200 fans out there waiting to cheer their contestants on to victory. Now, how come you're not allowing them on the field? For one reason, Mr. Royce. I don't want World War III to start at my airport. You can bend the rules, O'Toole. Mr. Fingerman, the promoter, he's spent thousands. Mr. Royce, if anything should happen to those girls, it could trigger an international incident. As long as I'm security chief, only the press is allowed on the field. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to the tower and see that your flight gets off all right. I'll get you for this, O'Toole. Can't wait. Pictures uptake-- That's it, girls. Yeah. Wonderful. Wonderful. Sure. One this way-- very nice. Thank you. Come on, I'm telling you-- Come on. Good. [interposing voices] Hold it, ladies-- let's have a few for the press. [camera clicks] Miss Shaefer, how about a nice, deep breath? Don't touch yourself. PHOTOGRAPHER 1: Thank you. Beautiful, beautiful. Turn around and smile. PHOTOGRAPHER 2: A little leg, baby. Show them a little leg, honey. That's the girl. PHOTOGRAPHER 3: Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful. Hey, Marv-- give us a nice big one. Come on. How are ya? PHOTOGRAPHER 3: Beautiful. Great. GLORIA LUDLUM: Uh, Miss Malloy? Gloria Ludlum, "Woman Kind" magazine. You won the Miss Beautiful contest a few years back, didn't you? -Yes. Yeah. Well, I was reading this book, you know, by a former Miss America? Whole chapters of the book were devoted to how to wash your face of perspiration. I mean, aren't these women demeaning themselves? I don't judge them. Oh, uh-- do you-- do you admire them? All I know is, they're up all alone, day after day, giving everything they've got. They say, "OK, world, this is me, like it or not." They risk disappointment, rejection, and heartbreak. Yes, I admire them for that. You make it all sound so glamorous. What did you get out of it? Well, I was a winner. Not many people can say that. How does it feel now to be a loser? You tell me, Miss Ludlum. I think that's going to have to go below. Hello. Michael, me boy. How are you? -Fine. Is 609 ready yet? You mean that beauty pageant charter? Hang on. Willie, check out Barney Jessup, will you? 6-0-niner, this is the tower. Advise ETD. Over. Tower, this is 6-0-niner, ready to taxi in five minutes. Clear. Aren't you going to fly the plane? Oh, no, I'm deadheading down to Nassau. Pick up another fight. I'm Paul Fabiani. Cindy Barrett. Nice to meet you, Cindy. [aircraft sounds] Excuse me, Captain. Would you happen to have a cigarette? No, I'm sorry, I only smoke cigars. Oh. Havana. Thank you, anyway. Not at all. BARNEY JESSUP [AIRPLANE P.A.]: Ladies and gentlemen, please return to your seats, fasten your seat belts, and observe the no smoking sign. Thank you. Tower, this is 6-0-niner, ready to roll. Over. WILLIE [RADIO]: 6-0-niner, you are cleared. Take off on runway 2-7 R. Wind, eight knots, northeast. Clear. [propellers roar] Have you ever been to Nassau, Miss McDuff? Uh, no. Well. Maybe I could show you around. That's against the rules, isn't it? Only if you get caught. Ah. [music playing] Are you all right, April? Fine, thank you. [music playing] Lawson Bar, Mr. Barker? Oh, no, thank you. Gotta watch the old tummy, you know? I suppose I should, too, but I could tell you truthful, I love these Lawson Bars. Now, my daughter Cindy-- Cindy Lou? Oh, yeah. -Cindy Lou Barrett? -Lovely child. Watch. She can eat 60 of these, and not gain a single ounce. Just keep that creamy complexion, you know? Ever since her daddy was killed when that tractor turned over on him, ha, I just ain't been able to stop. Ah. When she wins the Miss Beautiful title, I'm gonna go to one of them milk farms. Would you believe, when I was her age, I could wear a neck ribbon abound my waist. I was that small. Huh. Why, everybody in Pear Blossom said I was just the prettiest thing they ever did see. Pear Blossom, California. That's where we're from. You been out there? Excuse me. I didn't hear you. What were you saying? Pear Blossom. Thank you, I don't care for fruit. [LAUGHING] No. Pear Blossom, California. That's where we're from. You been out there? No. Never. Well, you come by sometime, and I'll show you some real good cooking. Bring your wife, of course. Or did I recently read that you're divorced again? No. I've never been married. You don't say. Sure you don't want a Lawson Bar? [audio out] [aircraft noise] [music playing] Just stay cool, friend. All right. [click] Now, take it down to 200 feet. This is my friend, Buck. Now, Buck gets upset very easily. And when that happens, he usually hurts people. You just, uh, just do like we say. [telephone buzzes] Security. O'Toole. LEW [TELEPHONE]: Lew Bachs, Mike. Yeah, Lew? What is it? LEW [TELEPHONE]: Flight 6-0-9 just went off the radar screen. You sure? LEW [TELEPHONE]: Hell, yes, I'm sure. I'll be right up. Aren't we flying awfully low? I wouldn't worry. The pilot's in control. How long have you been in the beauty contest business? Ever since I was a little girl. Do you like it? I never thought about it. You're very beautiful. Mama says I have all the equipment. Don't you feel beautiful? Feel beautiful? PAUL FABIANI: Yeah. Mr. Fabiani, beautiful is the way you look. Not the way you feel. WILLIE [RADIO]: 6-0-niner, this is Miami. Do you copy? Charter 6-0-niner, this is Miami. Over. Don't answer that. Hey, keep it under 200 feet. Set a course for 1-6-5 degrees south. You'll kill us. OMAR: Just do like I say. WILLIE [RADIO]: 6-0-niner, this is Miami. Do you copy? Charter 6-0-niner, this is Miami. Over. Hijack-- [gunshot] I think he's finished, Buck. Mm. That's just one less to worry about. Now, tell the passengers everything is OK. Tell them we're flying low because the cabin pressure is out. Come on, tell them, damn you! Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Jessup. Uh, we're gonna fly at 200 feet for a while, due to a problem with the cabin pressure. However, everything is under control, and there's no cause for alarm. What's going on? I demand to know what's going on? Take it easy, Mr. Barker. It's all right. [click] How far from the airport did you lose them? 38 miles. Any report of a crash or anything? We did have a burst of transmission, but we're not sure it was 609. What was it? Well, Willie here thought he heard the word "hijack." Let's hope he was wrong. Try them again, huh, Willie? All right. See that stretch of beach down there? Put this thing down off shore. I can't do that. There might be a reef under that water. It's dangerous. Land the plane, Mac. You'll kill us all. Mac-- just do it. Pretty please. I'll have to tell the passengers. All right. [deep breath] Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Barney Jessup again. I'm afraid we're going to have to make an emergency landing. Everything's under control-- there's no cause for alarm. Use the pillows to cover your faces. Tighten your seat belts. When you hear my announcement, tuck your heads down between your knees. MRS. BARRETT: Cindy-- We're going to crash! Barker, shut up. You'll panic everybody. Just calm down. All right. Are you all right, April? Just a little frightened, Miss Malloy. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid, Miss Barrett. I'm not afraid. But could you please just hold my hand? [WHISPER] All right. All right, folks. Heads down. Here we go. Cover your face with the pillow, baby. Cover it. Protect your face, child. [splash] Ah-- Oh-- ah-- Whoa! [splash] [splash] Oh, hey, we're down! He did it-- he did it! Oh, we made it! [music playing] All right. Put it up on the beach. [music playing] We're all right. [music playing] Let's go. Come on, come on, let's go. Come on. [music playing] Good afternoon. Now, everybody stay real cool, and nobody will get hurt. OK? OK, out. Just stay quiet. This far. All right, just stay cool, huh? And we're all going to walk out of here nice and easy like. All right, you're going to get searched-- but don't get uptight. All right, starting at this end, let's move it. Go. What the hell are you doing? All right. Move it. Move! All right, baby doll, are you next? Let's go. No-- Move it. Put it right on over in that truck there, sweetheart. All right, you turn around, sister. Take it easy with her. Ooh. What do you say? Just take it easy, will you? Sir. Sir. I think we'll do a real interesting search later. I mean real interesting. Genuine Cuban cigar, huh? Well, I'll just confiscate this, and I'll smoke it when I'm a millionaire. You move it. Don't you move. All right, everybody-- seat belts off-- get up. You first. Come here. Come on! Now how long is this contact? 15 minutes. Lew, is it possible to fly that plane under radar? It's possible, but it's very dangerous. We'll have to notify the FAA they're off radar. Let's hope they're OK. You're dreaming, Mike. I know. Call the FAA. Tell them we've lost contact. Inside. Let's move it. Come on, fella. OK, Buck. You and fly boy there, take care of the plane. [music playing] Outside. Come on. Let's move it on out, huh? Come on, come on, get moving-- into that building over there. Go on. Come on, come on, come on. How's it going, Layla? It's fine, honey. How'd it go? Ah, we had to waste the co-pilot. It's all right. You've been [inaudible] before. That makes no difference. Yeah. Where's the body? In the plane. OK. After dark, go on down there, get rid of the body. We might need that plane if anything goes wrong with Roman. Yeah. Hey, Roman should be calling out demands, just about now. Heh. Too bad we ain't got a radio. Sure would like to hear that conversation. Inside. Inside, eh? Come on. Move it. Get it on in. Move it. No, sir. We haven't called the FBI yet. The flight's 20:00 overdue. Yes, sir, that's right. Headed toward Nassau. No. No, we haven't released anything to the public yet-- Hold on, Lou. Hang on-- we think we've got a contact. I'll call you back. Put it on the speaker, Willie. ROMAN [RADIO]: Miami Tower, this is flight 6-0-9, do you read me? This is the Miami Tower. Come in, 6-0-niner. ROMAN [RADIO]: Miami Tower, we have just liberated Flight 6-0-9. Let me have that mike, Willie. Please repeat, 6-0-niner. ROMAN [RADIO]: We have just liberated Flight 6-0-9. Who are you, and what's your location? ROMAN [RADIO]: This is the International Liberation Army. Is that a joke? ROMAN [RADIO]: You'll find out. We have taken over Flight 6-0-9. You will receive our demands at 6:00 AM. Out. Hello-- 6-0-niner, hello-- do you read me? What's the International Liberation Army? I don't know, but I think it's time we call the FBI. All right, listen up. Anybody tries any funny stuff gets killed. No questions asked. OK? Now, Layla here can get pretty nasty. Ain't that right, baby? Heh, heh, heh, heh. You just act right, and you'll all be back home by tomorrow night. If everything goes as planned. You know, uh, me and Buck here, we ain't such bad guys. Now, Buck, he, uh-- he really loves people. Ain't that right, Buck? Yeah, yeah, I do. I do. Especially the ladies. See what I mean? [jet engines scream] Talk to you later. Hello, Mike. Hector. How's the FBI business? -Busy. Any news? No plane, if that's what you mean. Uh, these two gentlemen are down from Washington. Uh, his name is Faulkner. And, uh-- -Mr. Faulkner. --I'm sorry. I don't-- Smith. Joe Smith. Smitty. -OK. Uh, we'll give you everything we've got. It's not much for the FBI to go on, but at least it-- Hold it-- hold it, Mike. The FBI is not going to handle this one. What are you talking about? We have what may be a hijacking on our-- No, Mike. The investigation will be handled entirely by Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Smith. Now, what do we need with the Foster Grants? Hector, I don't understand. You don't have to understand, Mr. O'Toole. All you have to know is that this investigation has been classified top secret. That means it's a federal offense to mention outside this office. By whose authority? Mine. Now, look. I've got a plane load of people missing, and I intend to find them if I have to put the Boy Scouts on it. I will allow one call to the outside to be made regarding this matter. Smitty? I think you'll recognize the authority of the person at the other end of the line. Operator, I'd like to make a long distance phone call to Washington, D.C. My code number is 80437. I'm calling area code 202, 555-6700. Thank you. Extension 101, please. Yes, this is Joe Smith. We are in Miami. Yes, can you put me through to him? The chief of airport security needs his OK. Right. Hello, sir. Yes, sir. Just a moment. Hello? Yes, this is Michael O'Toole, Chief of Security, Miami Airport. To whom am I speaking, please? Yes, sir. Yes, sir, your men are here now. Yes, sir, they've informed us. Naturally, I wanted to make sure. All right, thank you, sir. Goodbye. All right, gentlemen. What can we do for you? You can postpone the search. What? I said, postpone the search for that plane. What about Nassau? They'll be notified that the plane was unavoidably delayed. As far as the outside world is concerned, the plane is not missing. And it will remain not missing for the next 24 hours. [music playing] All right. I took care of the co-pilot. Good. You want a little jolt? I don't need that stuff. Yeah, I know what you do use, baby. I kicked the junk in Rayford. Well, this ain't Rayford. I sure hope you ain't going to get strung out on us. Don't worry about me, son. Worry about them. OK. Everything all set? Yes, sir. The red phone is to our communications center, the green phone is to our base, the black one is to Washington. The, uh, scrambler's on the desk. Thank you. Do you mind if I ask who is searching for that plane? A search is being conducted by our own people. We have a direct line to them. They'll keep us informed. And what are we supposed to do? Our job. Which is to keep the lid on this. I don't suppose you're going to tell me what's going on, huh? Let me guess. One of the beauty queens is really Princess Margaret, right? You don't want an international incident, right? Wrong. OK, I might as well go home. Sorry. You can't leave the airport until after the investigation is complete. You mean I'm a prisoner? In a sense. Can I go to the bathroom? Smitty? Forget it. In that case, I think we should go up to the tower and wait for the 6:00 AM communication from the hijackers. -Sure. Why not? Hey, is this thing is serious as you guys are making out? Or are you just playing James Bond? The security of the United States is at stake, Mr. O'Toole. Please believe that. It's OK. Oh, please try and be strong. I can't take this anymore. I'm a sick man. I demand to see a doctor. [rifle cock] -Hey, easy. Take it easy. I've got to get out of here. Get a grip on yourself. Isn't there anything you can do? Why are you standing here? Can't you talk to them? Get your men to do something? Don't upset the others. [music playing] Don't worry. Don't worry. You're going to get a lot of press from this. I'll get your name in all the columns. OK. Guantanamo is down here. It's 6:00 AM. Anderson, it's Damon. We're expecting a transmission from 609 momentarily. I want a radio fix as soon as possible. We're ready to triangulate. We're locked into the big dish at Key West, and the Com Center at Guantanamo, Cuba. Stand by. Agent Faulkner. Are you all set there? Ready here, Mr. Faulkner. Getting something on 2-0-3-0. ROMAN [RADIO]: Miami, this is flight 6-0-9. Do you read me? I read you, 6-0-9. ROMAN [RADIO]: We want $1 million from the country of each contestant. One million apiece. Do you read that? I read you. Where do you want it? ROMAN [RADIO]: We will transmit the location of the drop at 12:00 noon. And Miami-- Go on. ROMAN [RADIO]: If the $5 million is not dropped by 5 o'clock today, we will kill one hostage every hour until we get it. Do you read? I read you. ROMAN [RADIO]: 5 o'clock. Uh, hello-- 6-0-9, hello-- come in, come in. Ah, he's off the air, Lew. Did you get a fix? Let me have it. 82 degrees, 25 minutes west. 24 degrees, 40 minutes north. Thank you. That puts it about 90 miles due north of Havana. Here. The Dry Tortugas, huh? They're going to be looking for the plane in the middle of the Gulf Stream. The middle of the Gulf Stream. Heh, heh. Beautiful. They're going to find Roman. It don't matter. They can't touch him as long as we got the hostages. We be as safe as a kid in a cradle. All we gotta do is just pass the time till he gets here with the money. Then we're gonna fly outta here like a bunch of rich birds. OMAR: Ha, ha! We have a fix on that 609 transmission. Are you prepared to copy? That's 82 degrees, 25 minutes west, 24 degrees, 40 minutes north. Probably the Dry Tortugas. You have your orders. We expect another transmission at 1200 hours. If you want the target? All right, it's yours. Layla is getting strung out. She needs a fix. Yeah, well where's she gonna get one out here? You know how cuckoo she can get when she needs one. Just keep an eye on her. All right? Do you have a light? [whisper] I'll try to get him alone. Do you have a match? [music playing] I have more than a match, baby. I thought you might. Would you like to go someplace and start a fire? Hey, babe. Later. We got plenty of time. [music playing] OK, everybody up! Up, up, up, up! [interposing voices] This sitting around here is getting on my nerves. So we're going to have a little bit of entertainment. In fact, what we're gonna have right here is a beauty pageant. Yes, sir. And we're even gonna give prizes. So everybody is going to get to do her routine. We're all tired and hungry. Just leave us alone. Aw, but you have to hear what the prizes are. The first prize is a surprise. Ha, ha, ha. But if we don't get what we want by 5 o'clock today, well, the loser of this contest gets driven back to Miami in a truck. [laughter] She-- she won't know it, because she's gonna be dead. BUCK: All right! So the first fight for your life beauty contest is now on. All right, everybody, let's begin. Oh, oh-- first, I want to introduce our distinguished judges. A Mr. Omar, from death row. Hey! Oh, and Mr. Buck, from Rayford Penitentiary, yard bird. Here I am, girls.

LILLIE [AS "KLAUS"]: Klaus. Tell me, Klaus. What would you like? LILLIE [AS "KLAUS"]: Come closer. I'll whisper. Oh, no. I can't do that. LILLIE [AS "KLAUS"]: Why not? You're a woman, and I'm a dummy. You have a one-track mind, you know that. LILLIE [AS "KLAUS"]: That's because I have no body. I think I'll sing you a song, all right? LILLIE [AS "KLAUS"]: All right. LILLIE: OK. You sing with me. [singing] Du, du leigst mir im Herzen. LILLIE [AS "KLAUS," SINGING]: Du, du leigst mir im Sinn. LILLIE [SINGING]: Du, du machst mir viel Schmerzen. LILLIE [AS "KLAUS," SINGING]: Weist nicht wie gut ich dir bin. I want you to hear this. It's going to be your press release. "Miami airport reported the attempted hijacking and crash of a chartered plane belonging to Sunburst Airlines. The plane, which was carrying contestants and staff from the Miss Beautiful contest disappeared at midnight last night. Radio contact was heard from a group calling itself the International Liberation Army, asking $5 million ransom. "However, early this morning search planes located wreckage off the coast of Florida, presumed to be the missing plane, which evidently crashed and exploded near Boca Chica Key. Frogman lowered from helicopters reported there was no sign of survivors. The identity of the hijackers is not yet known. Several possible leads are being investigated." And that's it. Who do you think you are? I know who I am. You expect me to back up that garbage? Garbage? You freak. You had that plane incinerated. You wiped it off the face of the earth, along with the girls, the crew, everybody. That's ridiculous. Nobody's going to believe a fantasy like that. Maybe before Watergate and a mafia attempt on Castro they wouldn't believe it. But they'll believe it now, mister. Well then, you're just going to have to keep it to yourself, aren't you? In a pig's eye I will. I'm going public on this, Faulkner. I am going to the press and telling them exactly what has happened. I wouldn't do that. You'll have to kill me to stop me. That could be arranged. Better do it now. All right. All right. I'm gonna level with you, O'Toole. Now, what I'm about to tell you is so secret, I could go to jail for even thinking it. I'm listening. One of the passengers on Flight 609 was a defense agency courier. O'TOOLE: So? He was carrying a small cylinder disguised as a cigar case. That cylinder contained a specimen of virus. A virus so lethal that, in sufficient quantities, it could destroy the entire population of the United States. I thought we weren't developing biological weapons. We didn't develop it. It was developed in an unfriendly nation. In fact, six of our men died getting that sample. Why was your man carrying it? The virus was being sent to a friendly nation which is doing research on anti-toxins against biological weapons. So we could still say we don't develop biological weapons in this country. Look, O'Toole-- it was a joint project. We supplied them with arms, they provide us with top scientists. And there was another agent aboard the plane to take it back to this friendly nation? That's right. One of the contestants. Exactly. Are you going to tell me who it was? There's no need for that. But if, let us, uh, let us say, one of the hijackers had accidentally opened that cylinder, the entire population of Florida would have been wiped out in less than a week. Now you see why we had to incinerate that plane? I don't believe in preventive murder. I'm not interested in your morality, O'Toole. And if any of this leaks, it could prove to be a very great embarrassment to this country. Embarrassment? Faulkner, you make me ashamed to be a member of the human race. Why didn't you try to ransom these people? Or rescue them? Because we couldn't take the chance. If that container had been opened in an unsealed area, the virus would have spread like wildfire. It had to be totally destroyed. Don't you understand that? How do you guys sleep at night? Sometimes, with a great deal of difficulty. [telephone rings] Faulkner here. It was what? A fishing boat? Well, what-- Did the frogmen go down to inspect the wreckage? Yeah. Yeah, right, I see. All right. Yes. Thank you. Cretins. They fouled the whole thing up. They blew up a boat. The hijackers were transmitting their demands from a fishing boat, so that they could move it around, pick up their ransom, and still hang on to their hostages. Idiots. Now, we have to start all over again, from square one. All right, so you blew it. Will you do me a favor one time? Try it my way? Find them? Pay the ransom? Please. OK, OK. Who haven't we heard from, huh? Who's next in this contest? I'll do my number now, if it's all right with you. LAYLA: Right, right, OK. I'll need a prop. A cigar. LAYLA: Got it. Heh, heh, heh. For my number, I would like to do an imitation of one of the great comedians of all time, Mr. Groucho Marx. [singing] My name is Captain Spaulding, the African explorer, did someone here say schnorer? Hooray, hooray, hooray. I shot an elephant in my pajamas last night. What he was doing in my pajamas, I can't imagine. [laughter] Da da da da da da da, da da da da da da da. In Alabama, the tuskers are looser. That's the silliest thing I ever heard. Da da da da da da da, da da da da da da da. What are you looking at, you lech? I'd horse with you, if I had a horse. Here. Hold my cigar, while I finish my number. [singing] My name is Captain Spaulding, the African explorer, did someone here say schnorer? Hooray. Hooray, hooray. BUCK: She was all right. Whoo. Ooh. All right, Captain, let's have it. Yo, Captain. What? What, what, what? Gimme the cigar. I'm gonna go look out for Roman. [music playing] [telephone ring] Yeah? Yeah, it's me. Hey, give me that again. Uh-huh, right. OK. Good. Keep on it. We just got a break. They picked up the man who was on the boat. We're talking to him right now-- Any identification? His name is Roman Garvey. He escaped from Rayford about six weeks ago. The others are Buck Tyger, Omar Welk, and Layla Burden. They're murderers, all of them. You know, we've got four hours until they start killing. Faulkner, for-- Get one thing through your head, O'Toole. I'm not interested in the hostages. My only concern is to destroy that cylinder. [audio out] --off the radar scope? About 40 miles east of the airport. How far could they fly to on it? Till they run outta gas. Do you think they got to Cuba? No. Guantanamo knows if a moth flies outta Castro's closet. What about Mexico? Air defense would have picked them up. I think they're in the 'glades. Where could a plane that size land in the Everglades? Did he talk? Did you think he wouldn't talk? They're holed up in an abandoned sub base in the Keys. Good. We're gonna need a helicopter and a special squad. Keep it small-- two riflemen and an explosives man. What about him? He has to go with us. If we leave him behind, he could spring a leak and sink the whole ship of state. I want him where I can keep an eye on him all the time. OK, Layla has picked the loser. She has her name right here in this envelope. [clang] I'm gonna set this alarm for 6:30. If the money isn't here in an hour, I'm gonna open the envelope. Do you think we're going to get out of this? Sure. Of course we will. Everybody so scared. I'm really afraid for April. You really like them, don't you? They're the only friends I ever had. Now, that's hard to believe. Ever since I was 11, Ma and me have-- and I-- have been getting ready for beauty contests, one after another. Do you enjoy it? Am I supposed to? The idea is just to win, isn't it? That's how Mama says. Well, Mama's wrong, Cindy. Why do you say that? Without Mama and beauty contests, I'd still be stuck in Pear Blossom. When this is all over, I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee and we'll talk about it. OK? I'd like that, Paul. So would I. Big Mama. Want a little jolt? Thank you. You're a country boy, ain't you? Born and bred. I could tell. You ain't so bad. Neither is that daughter of yours. Oh, you ain't gonna hurt her none, are you? Me? Shh. I wouldn't pour pepper on a dead possum. Well, maybe you wouldn't. But what about little old Layla? Yeah. Well, now, if I was to get what I want from that little girl of yours? I could see to it that Layla wouldn't hurt her none. You follow me? Big Mama? There's no Roman. Maybe we should hold a little beauty contest for the men, huh, Buck? That there's ridiculous. Why not? Now you mean to tell me that whole time you were an inmate that you never looked at other men? Come on. I've been there, remember? Now, this one-- useless. That one's ready for embalming. And this Mr. Macho here, with his oversized wristwatch-- he ain't nothing. But this fellow here-- he ain't what he seems to be. He might even turn out to be a real man. I think I'd know [inaudible]. They're all the same. They just got different faces. [helicopter rotors blast] Cindy. CINDY: Yes, Mama? I wanna talk to you, child. CINDY: All right. You're my own little girl, ain't you? Yes, Mama. When we get out of this, you are gonna be the next Miss Beautiful. I hope so. You don't have to hope so, child. You are gonna be it. The important thing is to get out of this in one piece. You understand? Because ever since you was born, I've had only one dream for you, child. I know that, Mama. Now, that Mr. Omar? Why, he's country folks, just like we are. And he fancies you. What are you saying, Mama? What I am saying is that if he wants to have his way with you, you let him have his way. Mama? I ain't never been with a man. It don't mean nothing, it-- it's-- You just let him. Mama? What? I can't do it. I can't do something like that. Damn it, child. I have done worse-- to get money for your schooling, your training-- why, it is no different from what I did every time your father touched me. Oh, Mama. Now, the important thing is to get out of this alive. You hear? Alive. Do you hear me? Cindy Louise-- do you hear me? Yes, Mama. Do it. [music playing] [alarm clock ticks] Roman should have been here by now. Maybe he took the bread and split. Something went wrong. We got trouble. We'll give him 10 more minutes, then we gotta kill somebody. [helicopter noise] Let's go. [music playing] CINDY: Who am I, Mama? I forget. Nonsense. You're Cindy Louise. No, Mama. That was that little girl we used to know. Cindy, stop that, now. You're Cindy Louise Barrett. Do you hear me? You're Cindy Louise. You're my own, beautiful Cindy. I don't feel beautiful. I feel ugly. [music playing] [alarm clock rings] You know, we gotta make a move, Layla. We've gotta do something. FAULKNER [OFFSCREEN, BULLHORN]: Attention-- attention in the barracks! We have you completely surrounded. You have one minute to come out with your hands up. One minute. What do we do now? Huh? We finish the contest. All right, huh? Who's gonna be the first to take the walk outside, huh? Is it gonna be you, mister? I wasn't even in the contest. Hah! No, but your fans would probably like to see you shot anyway. Is it gonna be you? Hm? No, it's not you. Go to hell. I have already been there, honey. 13 years for murdering the devil! He was my husband. No, no, no, don't-- don't take her. Take me instead. Mama, you just a beat up old Cadillac, honey. You might still ride good, but you've got over-sized tail fins and busted springs. And what about you, huh? What are you so afraid of? Why are you so afraid of Layla, huh? I had a friend just like you in prison. She was a real pretty black girl, and we was real close friends until she double crossed me. [WHISPER] We can't let her sacrifice that kid. [WHISPER] Just stay cool. [WHISPER] We could jump this one and get his gun. [WHISPER] We don't have a chance. And that made me really bigoted, and I think that's why you're going to be the first one out. Please don't kill me-- please! [WHISPER] You're a coward, Fabiani. [WHISPER] You can't save her. [WHISPER] Well, I'm sure gonna try. Layla! [bang] [screams] You dumb broad. He was-- he's the pilot! We got us a pilot, don't we, fly boy, huh? You're gonna get us out of here. I didn't hear you! Yeah. Yeah. OMAR: We just wasted your pilot, mister! We mean business. So do we. We'll burn you out. OMAR: Blow it out your kazoo, buddy. You make one move, and we start killing the women next. You'll have to negotiate, Faulkner. Stay out of this. Who gave you guys a license to kill? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. In the building-- there will be no negotiating. Either you come out, or we'll burn you out. [thud] [smack] You see this, Jack? Now, you make one single move, and she gets it. And then we start on the others. You understand me? You're trying to start your own war here. And you don't even know if that vial is there. You have a suggestion? Yes, I do. And what is that? This. Hey, hold it-- I want to talk. My name is Mike O'Toole. Tell me what it will take to release those hostages. All right. Let's talk. Not here. Inside. I want to count heads and see who's still alive. Come slow, and stop at the door. Come on. All right, inside. [audio out] Oop. Oh, don't! All right, Buck. Check him out. Clean. I want to speak to Captain Fabiani. Over here. Is anybody hurt besides Captain Jessup? Ah, he's dead, and so is the co-pilot. Uh, other than that, everybody's OK. Mr. Faulkner said to ask you if you need anything in here. Yeah. We could use some-- some water. And some smokes. Tyger over there took my supply of Cuban cigars. OK, uh, let's talk. What do you want? Just who are you, buster? I'm chief of security at the airport. What happened to Roman? Roman is in the hospital. They blew him out of the water. He, uh, told them where to find you. I knew it. O'TOOLE: You're wasting time. OMAR: All right! Layla-- you tell them what we want. We're taking a couple of hostages back to the plane. We want $1 million. I'll have to ask them. It's not my decision. You've got an hour to put it in the truck. We're taking Fabiani and two hostages. We want safe conduct to Nicaragua. We turn them loose when we get where we're going. I'll report your demands. We want an answer now, otherwise we kill another hostage. Understand? I understand. This would be a good time to lose Mr. O'Toole. Let's, uh, wait, and hear what he has to say about Fabiani and the Israeli girl, huh? The pilot and the co-pilot are dead. Everybody else is OK. What about Fabiani? He says to save him a cigar, because Tyger stole his. Did you see it? In Tyger's pocket. What do they want? They want Fabiani to fly the plane out, with two hostages. What else? $1 million in the truck. How soon? One hour. OK. What do you mean, OK? I mean OK. They've got it. You don't have $1 million. Yes, I have. Go back in there and tell them that we'll agree to their terms. What's the drill? I want you to plant some C-4 in that truck. You want to burn it? After the cigar is in it. Fabiani and the women will be in there, too. It's not our concern. There's our million dollars. Hello in there. That's far enough, O'Toole. You got what you asked for. How soon? Right now. They'll put the money in the truck. [music playing] All right. Nobody move, or they get it. You understand? Get ready, Smitty. You guys are insane, you know that. [boom] Back to the plane! Move. Move, move, move, move-- [gunshots] All right-- head for the plane, sucker! Move it! [gunshots] Come on! Come on! [music playing] Keep moving! Ugh. [gunfire] Start it up, or I'll blow you apart. All right. Run, Cindy Louise! Ah-- Yah! [gunfire] Yah! Ow-- No! Move it! Ugh. [aircraft noise] [sounds of the struggle] [whap] Oh. [gunfire] All right, all right, don't shoot! I give up! Take it easy, huh? Over your head. All right. Unh. [music playing] Fabiani! [gunfire] Fabiani! [aircraft noise] Well, fly boy. Looks like it's just you and me. You put it on a course for Jamaica. I almost had my hands on $1 million back there. Well, at least I got myself a good cigar out of it, eh? I wouldn't open that. Smoke bother you? Corona, Corona. Mm. Now, I ain't seen one of these in a long time. They say they roll it on the thighs of Cuban girls, huh? That cylinder contains enough virus to kill both of us in six hours. -Yeah? And what've you been smoking, huh? Look, I'm telling you the truth. Well, you know, they say a man will do anything for a bad woman or a good cigar-- Don't, don't-- don't! Wrapped in glass. Eh? Huh? Ah. What is that, fly boy? It's death, Tyger. It's all over, pal. You had to make me into a hero, didn't you? Yeah. [click] Pull up-- pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Ahh! Pull up! Pull up! Ahh! [explosion] AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT [P.A.]: Will Miami arriving passenger Carol Ottore please contact the information desk? As for the FAA report, Mr. Bach, the aircraft was definitely identified as flight 609, is that correct? That's right. And it exploded on impact, destroying everything and everybody on board. Most definitely. Thank you. Well. Except for the death of the two pilots, everybody emerged relatively unscathed. The embassies have been notified, and O'Toole, you might be pleased to know that all of the embassies wanted to compliment you on the way the rescue was effected. It was a nice job. A very nice job. Well, we'll see you around again someday, all right? Faulkner. I hope you burn in hell. Yeah, Sid. Yeah, Sid, we're ready. I replaced Miss Israel with a runner up. I know she's too tall. What would you like me to do? Shrink her? Look, Sid, I can't talk anymore, the press is waiting. Sid-- Sid, do me a favor, will you? Next time you have a Miss Beautiful Pageant? Don't hire me. AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT [P.A.]: Attention. Flight 609 to Nassau, Sunburst Airways, will be boarding in a moment. It's a charter flight for contestants and staff of the International Miss Beautiful contest. There will be no other passengers. You're not going? No. I've had enough of the beauty business for a while. Well, I'll miss you very much. I'll miss you. You were very brave. So were you. I heard what happen to Paul. To, um, Captain Fabiani. Yes, uh-- He was very nice, but he was a terrible coward. Cindy, Paul was one of the bravest men I've ever known. That's it, look right in the camera. [interposing voices] Come along, child. Shalom. Come on. Now, remember, when we get to the ramp, turn around for the photographers. Remember to smile, show them a little leg, and don't you bite your nails, you understand? [chatter] That's it. Well, come on, Cindy. They won't get your picture if you're late. Come along, now. What is wrong with you, child? I'm not going, Mama. What do you mean, you're not going? I'm not going, Mama. I'm not a piece of meat. I'm not a child. I'm a woman, Mama. And I'm not going. [music playing] Wonderful. Thank you very much. [chatter] [music playing] MARV BARKER [SINGING]: She's the most beautiful girl in the world, and she stands with her proud flag unfurled. She's so pure, she's so fine, how I wish she were mine, the most beautiful girl in the world. Take two. Fade to black. It's a wrap. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Ahh-- Whoo. [music playing]
