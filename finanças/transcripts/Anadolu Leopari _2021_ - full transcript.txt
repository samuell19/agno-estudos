ANATOLIAN LEOPARD Good morning, Mr. Director! Director Parking Only Mr. Director. -Isa, come in. -It's time to go. We are leaving. -Please give us your blessing. -My blessing is always with you. -Give us your blessing. -Bless you. Thank you for everything! I wish you the best Isa. Goodbye. Just as God gives us a lifespan, surveillance systems also have a limited lifetime. They get old just as we do. To be honest, we're wasting our time. We fixed the cameras for now but sooner or later they will stop working again. Let us not wait anymore, Mr. Director. Let us change the whole system. Everything. There are three kinds, but I recommend the ones with night vision. There is no need to choose a specific brand. They just need to have a 6mm lens. The brand is not important. But a proper installation is crucial, Mr. Director. This sector is full of crooks. You pay for steel cables, but they install nylon ones instead. How come you notice Mr Director? Are you a camera expert? You're not, right? Of course I'm not saying you should buy from us. You can search the market. How do you find the new lighting? It's good. It really changes the atmosphere, huh? -Good morning, Mr. Director. -Good morning, Gamze. They already started. Mr. Mayor is there as well. They came for the surveillance cameras again. And... ...the solicitor called. Asking for the official birth certificate of the leopard. Okay. As I said, we're talking about an animal under the threat of extinction an indigenous animal of our country, a national cultural heritage. So unlike the other animals, we can't proceed with the privatization while it remains in the zoo. How come you haven't realized that before? Why did you withhold this information from us? -But it's not an ordinary animal... -Listen. Until now, we've done our duty and fulfilled our responsibilities. But these bureaucratic obstacles bring the privatization process to a point of no return. But it's a cultural asset, protected by a specific law. We need to follow certain legal... The director of our zoo is finally here. He's been pulling out all the stops in order to shed... I mean, in order to send this panther to its new home. He's in touch 24/7 with other zoos all over the country. Gentleman, as you may already know our dear Mr. Minister is famous with his Haymana origins. A very respectful compatriot of ours. Yesterday he called me in the middle of the night. He told me he felt extremely upset, because this wonderful project that will make our beloved capital a centre of attraction is being put on hold by minor legal details. And he ensured me he's already pulling all the strings in order to help us to solve these legal issues as soon as possible. Gentleman, now, what is our responsibility? Since our venerable minister is giving his full support and the construction has almost begun, it is our responsibility to finalize that deal immediately with God's help. Dear Mr. Mayor, do not worry about the financial issues. But we can wait for the takeover only until the end of January. If by that time, the leopard is still not transferred, we'll have to consider other alternatives. It will surely be solved by the new year and this special creature of our country, this panther will definitely be sent to another zoo, and will have a new home. isn't it, Mr. Director? Don't worry about it at all. Son, let's play our video. Let's watch it. Come on, play it! Tell me, Ibrahim? Cemil says Hercules will be sent away, and I will take care of the hippopotamus. Don't believe him. He won't be sent away, right Mr. Director? You won't let him go? I won't, Ibrahim. I won't take care of the hippopotamus. I would take care of Hercules only, no one else. I won't take care of the hippopotamus. I would take care of Hercules only, no one else. Mr. Director! So, this is your hiding place. Come on, you don't recognize me? I'm Nevzat. From the high school. We all laughed our heads off! "Shut up," shouted the headmaster. "But sir," said Ediz, "you asked the definition of reflex, so I showed you." Our dear late Ediz was such a character. Did Ediz pass away? Didn't you hear? Two or three years ago. First, he sent his wife and kids to the summerhouse. Then he hanged himself. He left no letter, nothing behind. There is nothing we can do. But he has a son, he studied civil engineering. I talked to the guys, we have employed him at our company. Leave me alone for a second! Oh, I was going to give you that. Looks a bit like a circumcision party invitation card. Have a look. We'll all be there, don't be a dickhead and come. -I'll see. -No way, Mr. Director! I just found you after thirty years in this shit hole! Tezer will be there, too. Didn't she move abroad? She got divorced a long time ago. One was not enough, she got her second divorce. Let me get this, Fikret. What, motherfuckers? Are you going to eat all of those chopsticks without me?! Look at them! Listen, I'm in a meeting. Give me a minute, I will call you back. Just hang up. Blockheads! I was wondering... Since the zoo will be shut soon... What is your plan? Are you going to retire? I can talk to the guys for you. We might employ you in the company, huh? A rolling stone gathers no moss! I have to go now. I'm late already. I don't want to keep them waiting. Your invitation is there. Don't forget okay? Bye. Did you put that basket in my room? What basket? They turned everything to a three-ring circus! Entering anywhere without permission! Those Arabs left a New Year's basket, some stuff inside. You can have it if you like. If not, just give it to one of the girls. -The solicitor called again. -We don't need it anymore. -But the leopard's birth certificate might help us... -No need, I said. Mr. Mehmet from the zoo in Ayvacik called twice as well. Tell him I'll call him back after New Year. Happy New Year, Mr. Director. Happy New Year. On this very busy night! Look at us! Fuck my luck! I called the electricity company four times already! What happened to your generator? They asked from the union, I sent it there. How could I know this would happen! Can't ask it back now, either. I ordered Beaufort for tonight, special for New Year's Eve. What? Beaufort, French cheese. Half of it must have turned sour by now. Son, don't waste the candles, nobody is going to come. What's your plan for tonight? Nothing special. I'll go to the clubhouse to see the guys. Why don't you join us? What shall I do there? No strangers. You know the people there. -And maybe some girls too. -Forget it. C'mon man, we could chat a bit, it's New Year's Eve. My daughter has a concert tonight. I'll go there. Dad!? Thank God they called me from school, otherwise I wouldn't know. -Leyla my dear! -I thought you wouldn't come. My princess, let me look at you! Leyla, you look gorgeous! Maybe you should have dressed up more colorful. -I'm fine like this! -I'm not sure. Wait, your aunt was asking about you. Mom, no need! You can take pictures inside. Smile. It starts! I should go! Wait! Just a moment! Just smile! That's good. Another one! Mom, enough! My hand already twitched in the rehearsal. Don't worry, you'll handle it! -I really should go! -No, wait! Ataberk, won't you give your sister her present? What is that? Surely, we couldn't let our princess stay in hostels! So we'll have a home in London too. Now I'm going in. See you later. Okay. Good luck. You're right. Even I can't bear to look at my own face. I always have this feeling... ...as if I'm disconnected... ...as if everything is happening outside of me. Things just pass right through me, nothing stays... ...as if I am condemned to lose my grip. A disgusting spirit permeated to my whole existence. Relentlessly, just like a stench that I can't get rid of. I wasted my life. I was talented, intelligent, brave. I could have done something meaningful in life, for people, for myself. But now... Now I'm living just like you... ...keeping my mouth shut... ...resigned to my fate... ...with my head hidden under my tail. I'm living like an obedient dog. I am dying. I'm fucking dying! How will you transform people without understanding and feeling them? They don't need your nobility, they are happy as they are. Because they are not allowed to be otherwise. Che has said all people will be united in superiority. A 1950 model Chevrolet has united them all in misery, instead. He created an equal, honorable nation out of slaves and prostitutes. And made them sorry as soon as they opened their mouths. You are only muddying the water with your hypothetical words. Hypothetical? Go there and ask people about socialism and hear what they say! Real socialism has not been practiced on earth yet. Real socialism! I will tell you about the real socialism. When I was in Moscow I saw they were selling something in the street. Do you know the most popular thing sold on the streets? Again you're bringing Stalin to our table! -Don't change the subject now, Nedim. -Happy New Year! Oh, welcome! How come you came to see us? Welcome, Fikret! What on earth brought you here? Why not? Welcome! Fikret! Great timing! I was explaining real socialism to these numbskull communist friends of yours. Of course it's all water under the bridge for you now. Listen! As I said, in Moscow... In Moscow, Fikret, they are selling something in streets. So what are they selling? -What are they selling? -Just guess. What? Just guess something! -Water? -No -Butter? -No -Gas tubes? -No. Light bulbs, man! -So? -They sell bulbs, but they're all burned out. Do you mean they sell burned out bulbs? Exactly. -Why? -I also asked this question to myself. Let me tell you why. One night, I was feeling down, I went out. I got drunk with vodka. I went out from the bar, I started vomiting. Then I felt a hand on my shoulder. Fikret Öztürk? Ibrahim, open the door, we'll just talk. Son. You can't lock the door to the state. Ibrahim, such an incident calls for heavy punishment. It's a cultural heritage. An indigenous national asset! Listen Ibrahim, no one will get angry with you. Now, tell me. How did it happen? Son! Look, all these men, at this hour of the night are waiting to hear what you have to say. Our Mayor left the wedding of an undersecretary to come here. Did this animal just fly away, or what? Huh? Did it fly away, you bastard?! -I won't be tending the hippopotamus! -What? Fuck the hippopotamus! Are you kidding me, you son of a bitch? Open the door, you son of a bitch! Open the door! Open the door quickly, or I'll kill you! Open this door! Now! Otherwise I will kill this bastard! Go! Break this door! God dammit! You fucked up everything! -Sir... -What now? Mr. Director is here. -Sorry for disturbing at this hour. -Is everything alright? We have a serious problem. You might have alright heard. -What happened? -What kind of a director are you! These stupid assholes lost the panther! You put one animal in charge of another! What? What the fuck am I going to tell the minister, now? What? Tell me! What am I going to tell the minister now? You fucking ruined me! Yes, Mr. Minister? -Ibrahim has been living here, right? -Yes. For how long? His father was a caretaker here. He's been here since his death. Last night, the workers took him out. They were boozing. It was New Year's Eve, of course. He only found out what happened late in the afternoon. This way. The cage was locked, no traces on the bars either. We checked the ground, there is no hole or anything. We asked miss officer about the security cameras, but she said they're not functioning. Right, miss? We're in the middle of a privatization process. We have limited resources. First thing tomorrow morning... ...you will kick this bastard the fuck out of here! I don't want to see him here again. The Arabs are already looking for an excuse to cancel the deal. We're fucked! Listen to me! You all keep your mouths shut. No words to anyone, especially the press! Is that clear? Wherever it went, we will find this damned animal. -With God's help, we will Mr. Mayor. -We will. I should have closed and demolished this zoo years ago! Damn my fucking patriotism! Are you sure that it's here, Ibrahim? Enough now! This house is not for sale! What do you want at this hour? We are here for something else. Does Israfil Konar live here? -Who? -Israfil Konar. Who are you? We brought his brother. Israfil died two years ago. I won't tend any animal other than Hercules. Here. Good night, Mr. Director. Good night, Gamze. The latest example of this species was seen on the 5th km of Kislaca 22 years ago. In Yarabolu Nature Park. Mr. Saskal, Mr. Mayor is on the phone. -Good evening Mr. Mayor. -Good evening. Can we get first hand information about how the incident happened? First of all, I'd like to express my deep sorrow for what happened to our national treasure. I hope we will find the precious symbol of our city as soon as possible. It doesn't look like an ordinary incident. Our first impression is that it might be a kidnapping. So it didn't escape, it was kidnapped, Mr. Mayor? Yes, it looks like that. Who would dare to do such a thing? In the afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor will arrive to inspect with the chief police officer. Is Riza around? The gardener? I can check now. Never mind, I'll check. I can have some fresh air. -Bon appetit! -Mr. Director. -Please, come and join us. -Thanks. Neset, pour some tea. Let us have a sip of the groom's tea. Everything ready, Neset? With God's help, yes, Mr. Director. With respect, Mr. Director, Neset has a request from you. Well, tell me, Neset. Mr. Director, at my wedding... Could you be his marriage witness, Mr. Director? Yes, of course I can. -Riza, I have a request from you, too. -Certainly, Mr. Director. -You know that swamp area. -Which swamp? I mean that area behind the cafeteria. Yes? It looks terrible. We might plant some flowers, starting from the leopard cage. What do you think? -In this season? -What's wrong with the season? Snow, winter. They won't bloom. Just plough the soil, prepare it first, then plant in March. But plant something around the cage right now. Tulips may be nice. -Tulips can't survive this cold. -So? -Maybe daffodils? -Yes. Daffodils would be great. Neset, daffodils are behind shovels. Bring one for Mr. Director. But Mr. Director, I hope the Arabs do not object. -Last month when I was pruning the trees... -Forget about the Arabs now. Tell Cemil to give you a bulldozer and three or five workers to help. Plough it now, since the weather is still fine, soon there will be frost. True. Mr. Director, goat is an arrogant, vindictive, ill-tempered animal. Look. It gored my leg when I was a kid, just for pleasure. The scar is still here. But no more! I don't want to get gored again. Put yourself into my shoes, Mr. Director. What would you do if you were me? Considering the altitude and the flora you mentioned, Angoran goat seems to be the best candidate, I'm afraid. -Milk production would also be more efficient. -Forget about the efficiency or altitude. It's not just a business for me, don't you understand? What would I do with money at this age? It's about pursuing my dreams. It's about listening to my heart. I spent 30 years chasing rascals and maniacs. Why? I don't want to have stress anymore in my retirement days. I always like cows. I like their presence. I feel peaceful among them. Even though it would be hard to get going without government subsidies, I still want to have the farm that I dreamed all my life. But not with goats as they suggested. With cows! I think you might have knew someone who also knows how evil these goats are. I wonder if your friends can have another look at this report. Let me see. Thank you, Mr. Director. It would also be good to hear some advice on the farm's vegetation, plants. Mr. Prosecutor, Mr. Fikret is the director of the zoo. Sibyls said that if Narcissus didn't look at his own face, he would live very long. Narcissus grew up and became so handsome that many fairies and nymphs fell in love with him. But he was indifferent to their love. One day, a nymph named Echo saw him and fell desperately in love with him... but Narcissus spurned her. Echo was devastated. She languished and soon all that was left of her was her voice. Her echo. Anyway all these young nymphs and fairies got very upset when they saw what happened to Echo. And they prayed to gods for revenge. Then, one day after hunting, Narcissus stopped to drink water from a lake. When he bent down towards the water surface he saw his own reflection and fell in love with himself instantly. As he gazed, the divine penalty took effect and he simply passed away. No matter how offended Echo was, she got sad for his death. She went to pick up some wood to burn his body, but when she came back, in the place of Narcissus' dead body sprang up a golden flower. Narcissus Jonquila! Daffodil. It seems Mr. Director has a certain interest in botanics, just like me. And Mr. Chief Police Officer chooses people well to ask his personal questions. You got it wrong, Mr. Prosecutor, my intention... I heard about your fame, Mr. Director. Your dedication and hard work are admirable. How long have you been on board? -This February, it'll be 22 years. -22 years! Great. You did a wonderful job here. All the staff I've talked to respect you greatly. That's very nice of them, but they tend to exaggerate. It's my duty. Modesty is the brother of vanity, Mr. Director. I reckon, it must have been painful for you. I mean, the change. Privatization process. Aladdin's Magic Lamp! Naturally, somewhat... But we have to adapt to the spirit of the times, I suppose. But someone thinks differently, Mr. Director! By the help of God, we'll find them, sir. Have you seen the recovered security camera footage, sir? Anyway... As you can see, I also have a large field to plough, Mr. Director. But the oxen in my plow are weak. It was a pleasure, Mr. Director. A pleasure. Come and drink my bitter coffee as well, Mr. Director. Banana’s grieving deeply. However, every mother leopard has to cope with losing her cubs. Out of eight cubs of Banana, only four reached adulthood. She can’t grieve for too long. She has to go on with her life. And for that, she has to hunt. Mr. Director? Mr. Director! Mr. Recep's brother-in-law is the husband of Hacer's sister-in-law. He is a believer with the fear of God. Don't worry, Mr. Director, I'll talk to him. Look, he gets along well with our dog. I think it will work. But what we will do about the uniform size? Let's take a look. Ibo! Ibo! Come inside. Come here. Lean down. Wait. Okay. You can go! Yes, we have problems with uniform. At worst, we might sew one. Thank you, Isa. Thank you, Mr. Director. -I can't, Mr. Director! -Take it! Take it! Thank you very much! -Chief. -How did it go? We printed it. So? It's dark again, sir. Did you put it in Photoshop? Yes, sir. It might be because of the photo. We tried to increase its brightness, but... You can't properly print even a cow! God knows what they will do if I wanted a printout of a serial killer! -Sir, I can try upstairs at Narcotics. -Forget about it! A bit dark here, but when you look carefully, you can see a certain pattern on it. They called them Simmental. Isn't it beautiful, Mr. Director? I was thinking... Son! You can't execute a simple task, at least order us two teas. -Yes, sir! -Coffee is enough. Thank you. Perhaps, I was thinking, I might help you by watching the new footage. What footage? I mean the recovered security camera footage. So we didn't leave a good impression on you, huh? You decided to search for your leopard on your own? I just wanted to help. Just kidding, it might be a good idea. Maybe you'll recognize something. -Son, is Suleyman here? -Yes, sir. Take Mr. Fikret there. He'll watch the zoo's security camera footage. Yes, sir! -Please, come, Mr. Fikret. -Excuse me. This was the last one. It is very dark, I can't see anything. Unfortunately the system doesn't have a night vision feature. If we try to increase the brightness and zoom in it becomes grainy. Can't you clean it up? The IT guys will try, but I'm afraid it's very hard. Suleyman, did you manage to find something out? Unfortunately no, sir. To be honest, I was expecting something better, but... Because of the movies, people think we can solve all cases in a second. For God's sake, don't believe that nonsense, Mr. Director. Let's hope our guys can work on this and come up with something we can watch. Did you find out what happened to the cameras? Something was spilled on the fuse, a chemical. Ammoniac, sir. Now you will ask how they erased the footage then. They didn't erase. The system is so old, it can record only twelve hours and then starts to overwrite. Obviously, it's a trick! Of course they knew how the system works. In order to make it look like an amateur's job they damaged the fuse instead of the recording device. If my hunch is right, we are not dealing with a simple incident here, Mr. Director. Anyway, let them work. This is not a case that can be solved by our humble gazes. -Good luck. -Thank you sir. Any news Mr. Director? Regarding my report? I talked to some friends, they're busy because of the end of the year. But they will call me back. Of course. Not urgent. Better late than never. Please. Did it escape or was it kidnapped? The search for the Anatolian Leopard that disappeared last week is still going on. Although authorities believe the indigenous animal is kidnapped by a gang last night’s striking news might offer even more confusion. We’re in Kazikdelen village, in Bala province. And right here, the villagers saw the Anatolian Leopard with their own eyes. The neighbours heard its roar, and since we’re hunters, we took our rifles. -Good morning. -Good morning. I had Ibrahim's stuff packed. Thank you. They called from the secretariat. Mr. Prosecutor is expecting you in the afternoon. Didn't they say anything? They said it's important. Alright. Okay, don't touch anything. Don't change the place of anything. Okay? Bye. Do you like hospitals, Mr. Director? As much as anyone. I do not like them at all. My father was a gravedigger in a small town. Then the government constructed a big hospital. And then came a young doctor, an exceptional one. Those who arrived with a foot in the grave, were dancing in their wedding in less then a week. There were some months with no death at all. We were starving. Embarrassingly, waiting for the old people to die. So my father took my brother and me out of school. God forbid, nobody deserves hunger. Amen. Then one day that doctor disappeared. The sick waiting for a cure turned the hospital into a shrine. Animals were sacrificed, people were praying. They could not find the man. He vanished into the blue. Neither dead nor alive, never found again. Anyway. Then a new doctor came to town. Those whose time was up began passing away again. So we went back to school. I became a prosecutor and my brother a doctor. I know very well who did this, Mr. Director. I know it, for I grasp the issue with my soul, not with my brain. We're looking for a gravedigger, Mr. Director. Hungry or well-fed, it doesn't matter. But certainly a gravedigger. And we will find him. Hopefully. Sorry to take your precious time. I hope to see you again. -May I be excused? -Yes, of course. Mr. Director? I never took a plane. I'm scared of things I can't control. How odd. Sometimes you don't see the one in front of your eyes. Always looking for the one you need far away. I talked to the prosecutor today. How did you manage to erase the security cameras footage? Ammoniac. How did you get ammoniac? The caretakers left some jerrycans in the office after cleaning the alligators' pool. -Did you put them back? -No. But they took them back later. Do you think they might find out? I don't know. Maybe. We have to act as if nothing happened. Understand? Call Mr. Mehmet and tell him that we will visit him to see the facility and discuss the transfer of the leopard. But the leopard is dead... I mean, escaped. So what? Soon it will be found. I'll pick you up at 8am. Send Ibrahim's stuff to the Grand Rome Hotel. Welcome! Come in! Over there. Behind the brown pelicans' nests. In summer, they will make their nests here. They will migrate in spring and return in winter. What are these? Wind break panels. For the babies? Miss, you are not only beautiful, but also very brilliant. You have thought of everything, down to the smallest detail. It's true. But don't ask me how we managed to find the funding! The municipality didn't stir a finger to help. Same for the ministry as well. You know the saying. The tree that bears fruit will be stoned. Our teas are finally here. Mr. Director, it's not so tasty as in the old days but you cannot find it anywhere else. You know Miss, maybe Mr. Fikret told you we consider him our fellow in this city. We came due to my father's duty. I went to middle school here. He was the town's judge. Everyone was scared as hell of him. My father respected him a lot, he wanted me to become a judge as well. Didn't your father force you to study law, Mr. Director? My father never put any pressure. When he asks us something, we would all bow our heads. Just like in court. I studied law for two years, but it was obvious that I got along better with animals than with humans, so he let me go. Maybe he was getting old. Hope he's in good health. He passed away nine years ago. Let God rest his soul. Even we are getting older now. To be honest, when Miss told me that you're coming, I was a bit surprised. I'm sure it will be found, but anyhow... Please, don't hesitate. Have your desert, so we can go and have a look around. Also I'll show you the area for the wild bird park project as well. This is the natural habitat of twenty-four species. There is no such place in the world. They migrate to Lesbos only in the spring but they always build their nests here. Is that land Greece? No, it's ours. The one with the mist there, that's Lesbos. I can even see the houses. In summer, you can even see the storks on top of them. Well, we gave away even the places under our nose. What a pity. Isn't it so, Mr. Director? But by a twist of fate, I'm getting some toys and ropes from them. I'm also in touch with the Iranians. We're expecting to get the female Persian leopard by February. I hope they won't change their minds after all that's happened. -Any news about it, Mr. Director? -I'm afraid no. To be honest, it's very sad. When I saw on TV his wife and children at the funeral... May God rest his soul. Has something happened to someone, Mr. Mehmet? Haven't you heard? It was all over the news. They said it was an accident, but... Last night some villagers saw the leopard in the woods and called the police. So he participated in the search personally. There was a heavy fog I suppose. Then, when an unexpected sound was heard a stupid private got scared, fired his rifle and accidentally shot the man dead! Who? I suppose he was the Chief Police officer. See? That's what you get when you want to do your job properly in this country! This is Shiraz. He roars like thunder. She's been with us for two years. Come, let me show you the cages. Why did you help me, Gamze? I've always thought I was the last member of my endangered species. As if everyone else had already passed away... ...as if they left me there alone. Until you... You are not the only one, Mr. Director. They will put us through the wringer. After all that's happened. I was thinking, perhaps... This weekend, I am invited to the reunion of my high school. All the tycoons and crooks will be there. The hotel is somewhere close, a couple of hours drive. Another place close to Greece. Even closer. Let us show ourselves there first. And then, perhaps... ...with a ferry, together... If that's what you wish, Mr. Director. There is no "Mr. Director" anymore, Gamze. There's only Fikret now. Our friend had dedicated his life to his duty and he was bravely ready to sacrifice everything for his country. These dirty hands who killed our colleague... Mr. Director! I was wondering whether you escaped together with the leopard. Well, won't you introduce us? Nevzat. Ezgi. A pleasure to meet you, Ezgi. Life is so cruel, luck is on the side of such grumpy men. -Well, well, great to see you! -Hello. Welcome! How are you? You remember Fikret, right? He used to sit next to Ediz. Anyway, never mind. Me neither, I don't remember anything! Look who's there! Tezer. Let's go! Come on! Ladies... Let me leave this beautiful woman with you. If you permit me, Ms. Ezgi. -Of course. -Excuse us, please. After you, Mr. Fikret. "You don't lack anything, you have too much," we said. How can you play that part? It's impossible! At that time he already had this huge potbelly. But he thought that if he couldn't play Romeo, then the girl would never like him. He just kept saying: "I'm going to play Romeo." How come you remember all those details? I make them up, since you don't remember anyway! -Did he play Romeo in the end? -Of course not. He became Suheyla's Romeo in the end. So who became Romeo? You're such a curious cat! Who cares? See, you don't remember! You're just making it up! Fikret played Romeo. I don't remember that much. I need a smoke. And who played Juliet? You're such a curious cat indeed! You should've become an actor instead of an engineer. It's damp here, you might catch a cold. Nothing to compare to the chill of Ankara. I'm sure we met somewhere before, but I cannot remember where. Maybe for some business. What do you do for a living, Ezgi? I'm a stewardess. That's it! We were definitely on the same plane. I wonder when I got so old as to forget such a pretty woman! I hate flying. Do you travel often? Often? I don't even understand why I pay rent for my flat. My daughters have grown up. And your wife? My wife died four years ago. Human beings, nothing more than a piece of straw. Mr. Director. Neset! -Congratulations! -Thank you! -Congratulations! -Thank you! -Wish you a life in abundance! -Thank you! May God bless you, Mr. Director! Come in. Mr. Prosecutor. Mr. Director. Please, come in. I don't feel like telling stories today. Perhaps you will tell me a good one. I'm not as good a storyteller as you, Mr. Prosecutor. Even though I have a very interesting one... ...I don't know how to tell. I came here... -to tell you... -Don't waste your breath, Mr. Director. The leopard was found. Last night the villagers saw the leopard in the woods. The military police chased and cornered it. But when it tried to escape they shot it dead unfortunately. At least, this is what is written on the official report. You can read it for yourself if you want. Your story, Mr. Director is too real for people to believe. But what they need is something beyond reality. So I'm afraid that nobody but us cares about the truth anymore, Mr. Director. You didn't tell what happened to your father in the end. I never thought you'd listen stories just for their endings. -Maybe you're wrong. -No. I don't think so. Are you curious about how your story will end? The gravediggers, Mr. Director... ...will live in the same way as the Nephilim. Until a deluge will come and sweep them all from the face of the earth. As I said, I'm not... ...feeling like telling stories today. Perhaps another time.
