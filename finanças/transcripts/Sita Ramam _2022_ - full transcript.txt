Waheeda! Stop! Waheeda, stop, Waheeda! You will fall, Waheeda. Brother. Waheeda. Hey, Rasool! They are calling you in. -(Muttering) Where is he playing? -Here comes Rasool. He’s asking about you. Boss has been waiting for you, Rasool. Come, Rasool, come. Five of you will cross the border today and step into Kashmir by God’s grace. Kashmir? What for? Operation Gibraltar. Peace be upon you, sir. Peace be unto you. Ashraf Sareen. 8Ak Front’ s battalion. Oh! 8 A K? -Who are these people? -They are terrorists, sir. What are they doing here? They are preparing for Operation Gibraltar, sir. What? Operation Gibraltar? What is that? Joint mission by Pakistan army and terrorists to occupy Kashmir. Probably the preparations are for the same, sir. Preparation? What do you mean? I will explain, Rasool… Those who read the Quran and the Gita are living as one fraternity in Kashmir… The Indian Army is the reason. Kashmiri Muslims seem to repose more and more faith in the Indian Army these days. We must burn that trust. But how? Who will help us? The Indian Army itself. You are going to create an earthquake in Kashmir. Say god is great! God is great. Say god is great. God is great. This is wrong! Why would the Army work with terrorists? I don’t have any information about it! I have to seize the vehicle. -Hello! -Good morning, Sir. Major Tariq. -There is a problem. -I am aware, Tariq. It’s your responsibility to help them reach their destination. -But I don’t have any orders. -It’s an order now, Tariq. Keep it off the record. Yes, sir. Hmm! Peace to you. May peace be upon you. Major Tariq! I am getting the pitch ready to play cricket with the Indian Army. Go and play. Come back with the trophy. Kashmir. So, you guys know what you have to do in Kashmir. We should go to Kashmir and live like the locals. And? [all]: No one should suspect us to be mujahideen. Take care of Waheeda. God be with you. These kids are not even 18. They are minors. This spark will one day become a fire in Kashmir. All the snow will melt into water. A riot broke out last night between Indian and Pakistani students leading to the desecration of the National Flag of Pakistan further escalating the situation and enraging Pakistani students. Over to our correspondent who has the Pakistani Youth President in London with her. Hi, I'm here with Pakistani Youth President, Ms Afreen. Hi Ms Afreen, what do you think of the present situation? We are not at all happy with how this is being portrayed in the media. We will show who we are! This was not an innocent act. We know there is a power play behind this. We will teach them a lesson by tomorrow. We will show you who we are. How do Indians always find the Pakistani flag to desecrate? One bottle of whisky, please. Which one? The one that burns. Hail, Pakistan! Where is Afreen? Does she have any idea who is waiting here? Anand Mehta. The car you set ablaze yesterday was his. He sponsors countless underprivileged students. The Dean’s spoken to him. Just say you are sorry. Do you know who he is? I don’t care. Hello! I am Anand Mehta. Afreen. Why a lady as young as you are … is so full of anger? Simple. To find a solution. There is only one solution for your rage, Your hatred and your violence. And that is love. Oho! So, you are the kind of guy who shows the other cheek when slapped on one, right? Like your man, Gandhi? Afreen! Behave yourself. Mr Anand! I am so sorry. Not you, Dean. She should be saying sorry to me. That’s not going to happen, Dean. Impossible. Do we have any other option? Enough! You are rusticated from this campus immediately. No, Dean. I would never allow a child’s education or future to be ruined by me. Afreen… Everyone makes mistakes. It’s natural. That’s not a big deal. You know, Afreen? Those who are not brave enough to apologise have no right to make mistakes. Realise your mistake and apologise. Otherwise, the option I can give you is- One month… one million for the damages to my car. Or then ... you will be rusticated. And I should make sure ... that each one of you lands up in prison. Deal! I will pay you the ten lakhs in a month. Hmm? It’s two years since you spoke to your grandpa. Will he give you a million as soon as you ask? Afreen, a sorry costs you ten lakhs. One million! Think again. I prefer apologising to my grandpa. Never to an Indian. I called you hundreds of times to tell you this. Probably you didn’t want to respond. If you did, you would know … Brigadier Abu Tariq is no more. How did he pass away? Thinking about you.. Don’t make a villain of me. He was the one who sent me to London against my wish. You know whatever he does is for your own good. Who told you London would reform me? Huh? Is it a crime to love your country? Who said it’s wrong? It is not wrong to love your country. But to hate your neighbouring country is wrong. Why did you come now? I need ten lakhs immediately. Give it to me and I will leave. Listen, uncle. I have no time to listen to your silence. He was my grandfather. He must have left some thing for me? Dear Afreen… By the time you returned I would probably be gone. This letter, probably, is the last conversation between you and me. I was sending you to London against your wish, you left without looking back. I was amused by your anger. It’s is true I am dying with sadness. But you are not the reason for it. It’s me. I broke my promise. I broke my word to Lt. Ram. Twenty years ago, Lt Ram entrusted me with a responsibility. You must deliver this letter to Sitamahalakshmi. I don’t know how eagerly Sita is waiting for this or what story this letter is carrying. This is a help your grandpa is seeking from you. A debt you must settle. This is a war a soldier handed over to his enemy, Afreen. You must make Sita and Rama win this war. You must make them win, Afreen. What is this? He left me a postman’s job? Why should a Pakistani soldier make friends with an Indian soldier? Meaningless! First arrange for my money. I will get this letter delivered. Sorry. Until this letter reaches Sitamahalakshmi, I cannot give you even a single rupee from his property. This was the will written by your grandfather. This is not a help sought by your grandfather. A debt you must settle. Sita… Ram. This is Captain Akram reporting. Hope you are enjoying the flight so far. AI 372 has just entered into the Indian air space. We will be landing soon. Taxi! Taxi! Where do you want to go, madam? Take me to Noorjehan Palace. In 1966, Princess Noorjahan, in order to provide higher education to girls donated her palace to the government. If you want to know more about the palace, please meet one of the college trustees Mr Subramanyam. He was an accountant at the palace those days. I don’t know what to do. I am clueless. One of our seniors, Balaji, is in Hyderabad. He’ll help you out there. Okay? Ram… Sita… Balaji… Not such names. Tell me if you have our names. Idiot! What you need right now is not our people. -Someone who can help you. -Whatever. -How much? -Two rupees. Namaste, Junior! Balaji! Placed me? Welcome to India. I heard you need some help? Don’t worry. You have Balaji. He will take care of everything. So, what is your work? I have to deliver this letter. Why did you come to deliver this letter? You could have put it in the box! It would have delivered itself. Turn it over and see. Oh! Return stamps. Two times. Crazy, right? So, that was tried. -Ah? -Twenty years ago. Holding a letter written in 1965, you got off the plane in 1985! Who wrote this antique piece? Ram. -Who is Ram? -No idea. Forget it. -Who is Sita? -I don’t know. Forget it again. Do you at least know what is written in the letter? No, Balaji. You came here twenty years later to deliver this letter… and I put aside my wedding work and came to help you! Either you should have some sense or I some shame. All because of Anand Mehta. Who is the new character now? It’s a long story, Balaji. Let’s talk on the way. Your grandpa gave you a letter on his death bed. If you keep this letter in Sita’s hands, the lawyer will keep the property documents in your hands. Wow, junior! I was actually thinking. You would not raise your little finger unless you have something to gain. Here. This is the address of Subramanyam & Co. Sitamahalakshmi! Ah, ah, ah! There is no one by that name in this palace, mister. Sir! Sir, try to remember, sir. Please. Sir? What are you doing? You asked me to remember. That’s not what I meant, sir. She came all the way here from some other country. That’s why. Even if she came from another planet, there would be no change in my answer. It’s not that, sir. -What is it, then? Hold on. -Huh? -Look, dear. -Sir! I had worked for forty years in the palace. There were more than 400 employees working. From those ‘more’ and to the rows below… You must have missed Sitamahalakshmi somewhere in the middle. Language… is important. I used to disburse salaries those days. It was Nizam’s palace. Hindus were not more than thirty. -What about Sitamahalakshmi? -You won’t find her. Why? Because there is no one named Sitamahalakshmi in the past, present or future. Why talk about ghosts, sir, now? I will kill you. I will dump you in Musi if you irritate me. Me? Yes, you! -Hey, Ganapati! -Sir? I am afraid I will die listening to him. Throw them into the store room. Let them search. Sitamahalakshmi…. Sita’s name is nowhere. Hello? Ah…Afreen! How are you? Not at all good. It’s no longer a palace. It’s a college. And there is no one named Sitamahalakshmi in the palace. Do you understand? That’s why the letter was returned so many times. Afreen, that’s not my problem. Instead of telling you the truth, if I lie that the letter was delivered and throw it in the trash bin, what will you do? You make mistakes. But you are not an unethical person, Afreen. I know you will never depend on lies. Delivering that letter to Sita is not just your grandfather’s wish. It’s also twenty years of his failure. It’s your responsibility to make your grandfather win, Afreen. Good luck. If you open this letter and read it, you may find some solution. My grandpa could have done it. But he wanted to do what Ram asked him to. What is this bonding between two enemies? Ram should know. No one knew about Sita in 1965. What would they know about her in 1985? Your time travel ended before it started. No. It has just started. How is that? You said it. That Ram should know. To find Sita, we should first know about Ram. If we find out about Ram, it becomes easy to find Sita. He is not Ayodhya Ram to get immediate information. -He is just Lieutenant Ram. -Exactly. Lieutenant Ram. -Madras regiment. -So? -Service year 1965. -So what? That’s enough to catch hold of him. But how? I have Balaji. He will take care of everything. Do something, uncle. Nephew! What do you have in your mind? Is this a grocery shop to provide whatever information you ask? This is Indian Army. Why did you come all the way from London to know about Ram? Err… I am writing a book, sir -A small research work. -Oh! There is a library downstairs. Civilians are allowed on Mondays. Any luck? No, sir. Keep trying. You might find something. Ram! -Balaji! Balaji! -Huh? Look, Ram! -It’s a checkmate. -Excuse me, sir. -Excuse me, sir. -Yes. This is Ram. Ram? Hmm. I don’t know him. Oh! This is Vikas. From our place. I am sure he knows Ram. Huh! Can you give me his address? Mr Vikas! Can I talk to you about Lieutenant Ram? I want to talk to you about Lieutenant Ram! Lieutenant Ram! Lieutenant Ram! I’ll have to call you back…yeah? -Jai Hind, sir. -At ease. Over! Any update about 312? Their ration provision were over four days ago, sir. I just spoke to the Commanding Officer, Vishnu Sharma. There has been continuous snow fall for the past fifteen days, sir. All the roads are blocked. It might take two days to identify the approach road, sir. Hmm. Okay. Jai Hind, sir. Ranjit, give me some hot water. Sir, we can have it for today. We are not sure of tomorrow. We will run short of kerosene, sir. Sir! The snow has reduced. Navin! Connect me to Lieutenant Ram! Tiger in… tiger in. Charlie come in… Charlie come in. Give me your exact location. Tiger in… tiger in. Charlie reporting, sir. 500 meters to the north east from base. Can you see anyone coming from our unit? No, sir. Negative. No food for us even today. Sorry, boys. Tiger come in… tiger come in… Tiger in. Sir, there’s a movement. What? Move forward… move forward. Tell me exactly what you see. Five civilians…four mules. Terrorists? There’s a possibility, sir. I don’t think they are Mujahidin, sir. How can you say that? Sir, the yellow cloth tied to the horse legs. It’s a Butta tradition, sir. They pray in the Dargah and tie it, sir. What if they are carrying weapons? No, sir. Trust me. They are definitely Kashmiri Muslims. What if they open fire first? I can’t risk my soldiers’ lives. It’s an order. Fire! Fire! Cease fire. Come out. Move. Sir! Ram was right. These are Kashmiri Muslims. It has been snowing for the past fifteen days. We thought you might have run out of food. We got you food. Sorry, sir. I couldn’t aim properly. Bad weather. I need a full, written explanation from you by tomorrow morning, Ram. Guns down! -Forgive me, brother. I was mistaken. -Sir… Mistakes happen. Please have your food. Already, Vishnu sir can’t stand you. Jealous. I wonder whether he will be satisfied with your explanation or insists on punishment. When I told him I was sorry for the mistake… he smiled and said that’s okay and asked me to have my food first. Punishment is better rather than killing such innocence and regret it life-long. I can take it. But it’s not true that Vishnu sir has some issue with me. What is it then? I don’t know. Sir! We received news from Kashmir. Our children have mingled with the locals in the past six months. They even got their ration cards, sir. They are officially Kashmiris now. Praise the lord. Make sure Jameel gets the news along with the picture. What news? That those four boys are Mujahidins. Ask Jameel to tip the Indian Army. I will begin the war after that. But the Army will kill the boys! That is the goal. Greetings, sir. Please inform Major Salwan that Jameel has come. With some important news. Sir! Greetings, sir! Something important, Jameel? Very important, sir. Ansari… Why this sudden meeting, sir? Anything urgent? Gentlemen! We have something really important to discuss. Please take your seats. What happened, sir? Four Mujahidin terrorists are living like local citizens in Kashmir. And this is over the past six months. Sir, they are all minors. Below 18 or 21 years. Sorry for asking. Is this information correct… Who is the informer, sir? Jameel. But he is never wrong, Ram. We don’t know what their plans are. But we know what we have to do. Vishnu, I need to get some of your best men. Spread them into four teams and clean up. Sir! Who are your best men? Arjun, Veeru, Vayu, Sharat, Gurvinder. Thank you. Alright. Good luck. Sir! Vishnu! Fix this right. What I fixed is a god damned bulb. Is he Lord Vishnu not to feel jealous? He is just Vishnu Sharma. Hey, is Abbas home? What do you want? Hey, Iqbal! Sir! This is the boy. Hey, stop! Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop! Stop! Hey, stop! (indistinct clamor) Hey! No! No, no, no! Why are you shooting? Bastard! This is what Ansari wanted. That’s why he made the terrorists cross the border. He made us kill minors and distanced us from the Kashmiris. Something is going to happen. To find out what, we must catch hold of Jameel. Outrage by the Indian Army officials killing four minor boys in the Kashmir valley… for the first time in response to- -Find Jameel. -Okay, sir. Brother, how are you? Give me two teas. Do you know any Jameel here? The army gets neither information nor tea here. Hey! What did you say? Go away from here. Otherwise, you will get stoned too. Go away. He went to such great lengths to get us food yesterday. Why this sudden change? Sir! All streets are empty, sir. -There is no one to tell us about Jameel. -Not a soul here. Sir, we couldn’t find anything on Jameel. It’s looking like a curfew. Where is everyone? Something big is happening. How long? How long can we tolerate this? Our women are being disgraced. Whose is Kashmir? It is ours, the Muslims. Not these Hindus’. Joining hands with the Indian Army, these kafirs saw our children’s blood. They mercilessly killed them. Right before our eyes. It’s time for jihad. If you don’t rise now, Islam will be finished, Do you want to see the end of Islam? Is this what you want? Revolt will start at Agarta. Burn Agarta today. Before the sun sets. Say god is great. God is great! Say god is great! God is great! It will take the troupe four hours to reach Agarta from the base. -Nanda! Inform the troupes. -Okay, sir. We must stop this at Agarta. They are too many. We don’t know how many more will come to kill us. -Let’s inform everyone. -No. That’s too dangerous. If they come to know of the atrocity going to happen here, Hindus and Muslims will be at daggers. That shouldn’t happen. It’s not like that. No one should know anything. We should evacuate the village first. How do we do that without informing anyone? I don’t have a plan. Tell me if you have one! When the villagers heard someone abducted a child, they left Ram alone in Agarta and chased after me. Ram hid the remaining kids and elders of Agarta in a safe house. Stay safe. But Ram had to save not only the Hindus in Agarta, but also the Muslims raging under Ansari. Before we could come here, the villagers got the news. The village is empty. Set the village on fire. Set fire! -Set fire! Abbas! Go that side. -Set fire all around. -Cover that side as well. -I will set fire. -Set the whole village on fire. Everybody are inside. You are joining hands with the Hindus against us. We won’t spare you either. We will kill you all. -Kashir is ours. -Set them all on fire. Against whom? Against whom? Who told you this is victory? Even if one life is lost here, it’s not you who wins. Only Ansari. I beg you. Those kids were really mujahidin. I fall at your feet. Trust me. Ansari’s fight is not for you. It’s for Kashmir. He is only using you. Put him also in. Jameel! Set fire! Jameel! Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Good that you came along with them. Otherwise, the truth would never come out. Tell them the truth. No, no, no! Don’t set me ablaze. Please don’t. I will confess. I will confess everything. I will. These five boys should cross the border today. Now, the… One thousand. Carry this information to the Indian Army. A very important matter, sir. Ansari’s conspiracy to distance the Indian Army from Muslims -was burnt to ashes in those flames. -Sir! I have made a mistake. Please forgive me, sir. Watching the Muslims dousing the fire in Agarta, the Hindus embraced them like brothers. They lost as a religion but won as humanity. I understood then. A man fighting with a weapon is a soldier. A man warring for Dharma is Rama. After the Agarta incident, the entire nation looked up to the soldiers as heroes. So, Madam Vijayalakshmi came to interview us from All India Radio. You saved so many families. But you are away from your own. If you want to say something to your family, please say it. My daughter is just born. They said she takes after me. I believe I must name her and repeat it thrice in her ear. But I am still here. Will you do it now? Now? Hey, Ram! I need your help. -What is it? -Sit! I need a nice name for my daughter. Suggest one. Amrutha? It’s good! Amrutha. Amrutha. Amrutha. Oh! Woo! Lieutenant Ram! Hero of the Battalion! Do you want to say something to your family? I have no one, madam. I don’t have anyone outside of these barracks. What? I am a lone soldier. Solo soldier. Ram! Coming. Lieutenant Ram is a name I heard only yesterday. He is a lone soldier guarding the hills of Kashmir. Only yesterday I came to know that he has no family to speak to. Or at least someone to write a letter. The country has Ram. It is our responsibility to tell Ram that he has us. I wrote a letter to my son, Ram, only yesterday. Now, it’s your turn. Oh, Sir! One minute. You have a letter. Letter? Yes. Lots of them. For me? Dear brother Ram! I heard about you and your story on the radio. From now it’s a lie to say you have no one. Your niece celebrated her birthday only last week. I made ‘Ariselu’. I am planning the ear piercing for your niece when you come down for vacation. Hoping that you will come… Please confirm through a letter. Yours, Your sister, Radhika. Ram sat through the whole night replying to those letters. He didn’t sleep. He didn’t let us sleep. Sir! I need two months of leave, sir. Why do you need such long leave? I want to meet my family, sir. Okay. What? Waiting for Postman Bahadur? -Yes. Three hours delay. -Huh! -He should be court-martialed. -Oh! Stop, stop, stop. -Where are my letters? -Sir. My replies. Send them fast. One minute. One minute. Ariselu. My sister sent me. Dear Ram! You have no one? Where did you learn these lies? You seem to have totally forgotten you have a wife at home. Wife? Sitamahalakshmi... You said ‘I am right back’ and left… for the job. Leaving me with my parents. My family did warn me. That this army guy wouldn’t stay home. Did I pay heed? Hmm. I married you so I have to bear this. Don’t miss me. Yours, Sitamahalakshmi. What, Lord Rama? How are you? It’s you. You must be fine. It’s getting colder in the room here. Are you sending it from Kashmir? It was raining all through yesterday. Seasons are also like you. They come but they leave without staying with me. When will you come back, Ram? Always in your thoughts, Your wife, Sitamahalakshmi. Your wife, Sitamahalakshmi. There is no from address. Sita! Who are you? “Kaveri gurgles in Kashmir valleys” "Because of your letter” “In these snowy mountains green crops are raised by your words” “The letters I read planted a smile on my lips” “In the cold, brazen winds they are like summer flowers blooming” “When will I see you? Keeps asking this heart” “My thoughts will send you that day a warm welcome” Ram! Jai Hind, sir. I heard you got married? You didn’t even tell me? I didn’t know either, sir! At ease. The girl’s name? Sitamahalakshmi, sir. “When will I see you? Keeps asking this heart” “My thoughts will send you that day a warm welcome” “When will I see you? Keeps asking this heart” “My thoughts will send you that day a warm welcome” Hey, Vikas Oye, Ram! Do you know? Along with me even our backyard is missing you. Plants stopped flowering. Using this as a pretext, butterflies are absconding. Will you bring them for me while coming? Bye. Yours, Sitamahalakshmi. “I don’t know what I have done to make you so fond of me” “You consider me your own, tell me what good have I done?” Get lost! “If only you let a hint to me” “Running across the mountains won’t I come to you right now?” Dear Ram! Our neighbor lady asked me how we first met. ‘Ravana’s annihilation in the Kurukshetra war and in the shimmer of the battle… Sita’s self-selection…’ When I told her this, she went away smiling as if she understood. No one can decipher this except you. Ravana’s annihilation in the war of Kurukshetra? and in the shimmer of the battle… Sita’s self-selection…’ ? By the way, I had a dream last night. You were in your sixties in the dream. You were still roaming around me. You kept calling ‘Sita, Sita’ for everything. And then it was morning. When I looked beside me, you were not there. Bye! Your wife, Sitamahalakshmi. “When will I see you? Keeps asking this heart” “My thoughts will send you that day a warm welcome” “When will I see you? Keeps asking this heart” Jai Hind, sir. “My thoughts will send you that day a warm welcome” Jai Hind, sir. Jai Hind. You have a letter. What? Yes, sir. Dear Ram! I am going to Hyderabad on the 12th of this month. When I was packing, I found our wedding clothes. She says wedding clothes! Your shyness dressed in those clothes is still fresh on my mind. Hmm. 48 hours journey! I never traveled so far all by myself. But I will manage. -After all I am… -A lieutenant’s wife. There is a magic show by Austin in Hyderabad this month. If you were here, you would have accompanied me. Bye. Your wife Sitamahalakshmi. There is no from address. Delhi. -Hey, Vikas! -Huh? I found Sita. What? Where? On the Delhi train. -When? -On the 12th of this month. -Come fast. -Coming, coming. They gave me only twenty days’ leave this time. I have to meet so many. Very short time. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind. Sir! How come you are here, sir? Are you on vacation? On a mission. -Oh! A dangerous girl is travelling on this train. Hmm. Is there a Sitamahalakshmi here? So, there is no one. -Find the TC. -Yes, sir. Do you have the girl’s photo? -No. -Tsk! How does she look? That is the mission. How do we identify her without knowing anything? I know. Her name is Sitamahalakshmi. We don’t have names and horoscopes. Only tickets. Please don’t say that. -It’s my future. -Ah! I mean… the future of many like me. -It’s in your hands, sir. -How? Hello! You are not a T.C now. You are also a part of this mission. But such missions are new to me. Don’t worry. -I am behind you. -Hmm. What is the plan? Train is yours and so is the plan. -Hmm. In that case, the four coaches behind you connect to Madras Mail at Bhopal. The 12 coaches behind me go to Hyderabad… along with me. Where is the dangerous girl going? Hyderabad. -Ask her. -Hmm. Ticket? You look like goddess Lakshmi. Is your name Sitamahalakshmi? No. Parvati. Damn! Hmm. This mission doesn’t seem possible. I have already covered eight coaches. -May be the danger girl didn’t board the train. -Please don’t say that. Look at them. All the passengers are sleeping because of their trust in you. -Hmm? -Let’s go. There are four coaches still left. -Hmm. Sleep. It will ruin my reputation. This is the last coach. You shouldn’t stay too long. This is air conditioned. It’s a special coach. Yes. Come in. That is the last coupe. Ticket? Who is it? “Ravana’s annihilation at the war of Kurukshetra’ ‘In the shimmer of the battle is Sita’s self-selection.’ Mr Ram? My replies to your letters. I didn’t know where to send them. So they remained with me. We’ll meet in the next station. Sir, did you find the girl? Is the mission a success? No. The real battle has just started, Mr Varadhi. Sir! Is my train out of danger now? No one can save your train or me. Huh? Ticket? What is this? You bought a ticket to Hyderabad and boarded the Madras train? What is this, brother? -Madras? -Huh? The four coaches behind you connect to Madras Mail at Bhopal. Dear Sitamahalakshmi! I am going to stay in your Bhaagyanagar… no, no… In my Sitanagar for a month. Only for you. I have my friend, Durjay, in the lane next to Charminar. He is a big dramatist. It’s a bit difficult to find him. But I have to. Because he has a telephone at home. Number 37612. I will be waiting for your call. Yours, Ram. (Sanskrit poem) Bharathi! Scale! You find fault with my scale? I have four degrees in music. Thermometer has lot more degrees. How are the two connected? In all fairness… To beat you at irrelevant talk there is… There is? No one. Don’t praise me, Bharathi. You are a precious gem combining obscurity and innocence. Enough of your flattery and concentrate on your poem. Yearning for the appearance of Rama…Hanuman. -Who is there? -I am Ram. Lord Srirama! Rama! Have you come down personally for me? My life is blessed. My life… Sucks. -Hey, you didn’t expect me, did you? -I don’t know. I came unannounced to surprise you. Dangers and difficulties never come announced. They come unannounced. What problem have you brought with you now? -Where is the phone? -Over there. ‘Hail, Lord Shiva” What is this hygiene and cleanliness, Rama? -Hey, Durjaya! -Hmm. That phone stopped working a week ago. When do you bother to get it repaired? The phone stopped working only a week ago. Our government stopped working six weeks ago. I gave them a complaint. I am sick of your lies every day. Poor grandma. Hey! Do you realize how you have betrayed me? I didn’t know till now telling lies is such a big betrayal, soldier. I can’t see Sita again. I don’t even know her address. You have destroyed my only chance. Sita? Hi. I am Ram’s friend, Vikas Varma. Who is Sita, Varma? That’s a big story, Durjaya Sharma. Is there no summary? Okay. Is anyone home? Why not? What is this? Why isn’t your phone working? Have you come to repair it? Without a complaint? Please, come. Stupid phone. It’s been a big issue with grandma for ten days. -And since morning… -Can you call Ram? Sita? Hmm. Those days Rama went to find Sita. Sita has come looking for Ram. This is Kaliyug. Let me call him. Lord Srirama? What is it? Mother Sita is here. You stepped into my life for the first time. What will you have? For a few words in a letter, how did you leave Kashmir to snow and come here? Lots of letters stating you are born for me. Rain of letters in Kashmir. I had to come. Sorry, madam. I took your picture without your permission. The phone wasn’t working. I was literally doing penance to meet you. And you appeared before me… like an angel. Do you know something? I know your letters by heart. I read them over a few hundred times. When read them it feels as if we are married for so very long… - What? I mean… It feels like we know each other for a very long time. Same way, consider them casual scribbles since I was confident I’ll never meet you. I actually came to tell you this. That’s a lie. Why would you come looking for the address just to say this? You came to meet me. Admit it. I got to go. Ms Sita! Just a minute. Even the rain asks you not to go. It’s time for my dance class. Ms Sita! I used to get wet in snow alone. It is unfair to bring me so far and drench me in rain! So sad. Tell me your travel expenses. I will pay you. Dear Sitamahalakshmi! The rain that came looking for you, and I… To walk away from us both without getting wet with you at least for a while, makes my breath evaporate even in this rain. Only you can burn away the distance that’s going to kill me. Truly, Yours Ram. If you give me the address, I will post it. To give the address to danger and invite it home, is not very wise, Mr Ram. Bye. Truly, Yours, Sitamahalakshmi. He was so happy he met Sita that he brought the roof down. Ram who had no one in his life, had a storm in the form of Sita. One letter… It
