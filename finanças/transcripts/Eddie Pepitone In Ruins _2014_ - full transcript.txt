♪ Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the bitter Buddha... Eddie Pepitone! Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! How 'bout a round of applause for the comedians who were out here. How 'bout that? Round of applause if you thought Lincoln's death was inevitable. Round of applause just because... No! Just because of the way that played out with the south and the hatred of the south. I mean, I saw it coming. Did you? Round of applause if you thought Lincoln's death was inevitable. Round of applause. Yes, right? Round of applause if you cannot access God. Round of applause. I... What? I cannot access God. What is all this talk lately... about accessing God through meditation, Pilates... I have friends who are accessing God. I cannot access God. By the way, what I'm doing... I just thing that comedians who do that kind of vapid, you know, round of applause bullshit, I think they should... I think they should do just more interesting round of applauses. You know what I mean? Like, to draw you in. For instance, round of applause... if you are caught in a web of lies so intricate... with your wife, that one small mistake on Facebook... one small liking someone who shouldn't be liked... just a tiny photo-like and your life comes down like a house of cards. Round of applause. Round of applause. And round of applause if that anxiety manifests itself late at night when you have your sleep apnea mask on... This is also the comic who doesn't realize he's talking about himself. He thinks he's relating to you... Like, he's being too damn specific. You know, but, round of applause if that anxiety, if it manifests when you have your sleep apnea mask... And by the way, your sleep apnea mask has a Spider-man decal on it because you think that makes sleep apnea cool. Round of applause. But, round of applause if the anxiety is too much. I mean, it's just too fucking much. Round of applause if you're sick of being a good fucking person all the fucking time. And... the fucking... the leaders... And round of applause... the leaders and the people who rule the country... The allegarts, they have no moral center, why do I have to... I mean, you... Round of applause... Why do I... I am sorry. Round of applause if you're sick of having a moral center when everything around you doesn't have a moral center, everything around you is just for greed and profit, but you're supposed to get up and be Mister Goody-fucking two shoes! Round of applause. Round of applause if you... Round of applause if you think Brooklyn which is where we are... And this is for the viewers. You know where you are... Most of you... But round of applause if you think Brooklyn has gotten too soft with grilled cheese shops and peanut butter shops. They... What kind of burrow is this where you could get grilled cheese... Grilled cheese sandwiches, maybe people in Brooklyn should start thinking instead of eating grilled cheese sandwiches and specialty peanut butters, maybe they should start organizing for lower fucking rents. I mean... They're all so wrapped up in grilled cheese... and cinnamon swirl raisin peanut butter... Which is delicious... I will not deny that. I had some today. But I go into these stores with a tremendous alert consciousness And where are the... Where are the Doo-Wop groups in Brooklyn? They used to be... they used to be on every fucking corner. Have they been rounded up and put in camps? Where are the Doo-Wop groups? That's the Brooklyn I remember. Round of applause if that's the Brooklyn... I'm feeling, a little hot already. Yes, I know. And now that you've seen the whole package... I wanna answer the question that you're all thinking and the answer is "yes" I have had a lot of work done. I had my hair removed and my belly let out, because I was too pretty. I was too pretty. No! I was a male model. I was a male model. I would leave the house with a to do list and I couldn't get anything done, because men, women, and children and animals would lunge at my cock... They would lunge at my cock as soon as I left the house they would be like, "Eddie, fuck me! Fuck me, Eddi! Fuck me! Please fuck me!" I would say, "Look at the to do list. I've gotta pick up printing paper. I've gotta prick up... Pick up printing paper and get twine for the recyclable." They didn't care. They were like, "Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!" So in order to get things done, I said to a dermatologist in I.A, I said, "Please, make me look like you people, basically." I was like, "I wanna feel what it's like to cry during the day like you folks do." Because male models, we do not cry during the day. We just fuck and we fuck and we fuck, and then we are given small monogrammed sweaters. By the way, I, I do rant and rave, but I just got this hat and I... I actually... I actually feel really good about it. I mean, did you... did you ever buy a hat where you like it so much, like, you look in the mirror and you're like, "Holy shit. This hat kinda makes up for a life that wasn't well-lived." Yes, I spent 30 years in a stoned-out phase masturbating to hockey fights... but that's because I did not have... this fucking hat. And by the way, I masturbate to hockey fights because they are unpredictable. I do not like porn. It's very predictable. And by the way, what is it with my relationship to porn? The only way now I can watch porn is if someone's life is threatened in the scenario. How numb am I... by the way, I heard you not laughing a lot there. And it's up to you whether or not you wanna laugh, but I am dedicating this set. I just visited a hospital in the neighborhood, and I'm dedicating this set to a small, small child who, little Billy Timson, who was born with no bones. He's just a liquid... He's a liquid with a little Met cap. He's a liquid in a bag with a little Met cap... He's a puddle in a bag with a Met cap. And you know how the Mets... well, the last 40 years... I mean, since, since Tom Seaver, really. I mean... and he managed to squeak out to me. Before I left the hospital he said, "M-make 'em laugh. I-I... I... "I... He, he... I don't know how he makes a voice, but it's just through the liquid... vibrations hit the Met cap and there is sound. And he was like, "I know it's, it's a very tense television taping for you, and I know that you're very neurotic and you think this night defines you, you're whole fucking life... as if one hour can define someone as rich and varied... as yourself and that you're basically a self sabotaging person. So this is the perfect... Anyway, I'm digressing." He was a verbose kid for being a puddle. A very verbose kid. But he was like, "Maybe if they laugh I'll grow a spine." So don't feel... don't feel like you have to laugh, but this is for little Timmy. Now... The thing I love about a hat, too, is that when you throw it... When you throw it, you always have to say something great. Like, I'll throw it to you, sir. What's your name? - Murph. - Murph. Okay, I'm gonna throw it to you, Murph. That's a great New York name, isn't it? You don't get "Murph" in Nebraska. Wait. You know what you get in Nebraska? You get corn, you get corn and despair. And just long pockets... of windy days. Wind, despair, Monsanto crops... Anyway, I'm digressing again. I'm sorry. So, Murph, I'm gonna throw it to you... The great thing about when you throw a hat, and throw it back right away, it cost a lot of money... Um... By the way... you know, I just want to cop to the fact that I am not a male model and never was. I... Matter of fact, I've put on so much weight lately that when I drop something I look at it and I go, "Do I really need that?" Anybody know what I'm talking about? I mean, I'll look at it, it'll be my license, and I'll be... I'll be like, I'm white. I don't get pulled over a lot. Did you see what I did there? I snuck in some social commentary. No, no, no! I reason I do that is most people just want me to talk about Batman and pussy. "Eddie. Please stop with the social commentary. Batman and pussy. Flash Gordon and porn. Something. That's what we want, Eddie." But anyway... when you throw a hat you always, you always have to say something great. I'm gonna throw it to you, Murph. And, it's like, "Baby, I got a raise!" You can't say something bad like, "They found blood in my urine!" Right? You can't say that. "I fucked your sister, honey!" That's the hat bit. I bought that hat... for $80 for that bit. I... I was not gonna spare any expense tonight. The Doo-Wop groups are gone. Let's make this a night to remember. I know... I know I rant and rave and I, I come off like an angry guy, but I, I recently have found a couple of things that are making me happier. I got this little Terrier dog... I got this little Terrier. She's a rescue dog, Charlotte. You ever get a dog and you're so friggin' attached to them? Like, she's a rescue, so she feels abandoned, and I feel abandoned. Like, I've always felt abandoned, so we're both on the same wavelength. Like, if I forget something upstairs, she immediately follows me and I'm following her. Like we're following each other all over the fucking apartment. "Charlotte, are you okay?" "Yes, I'm okay." "Do you need a treat? I need something. You need something? I need something." You're lucky to see me. You really are. You really... You hit a home run. I-I know you've had to go through some calisthenics because of the taping, but you really hit a home run by coming out here. You know, what the hell else are you gonna do? But, I have Charlotte... Now, by the way, the reason I love dogs, I have five cats too, and I fucking love cats. There's a tremendous, tremendous feline love that I... I have five cats, a dog... And, I know what you're thinking, God, what a fucking renaissance man. But the reason I-I-I-I... Dogs, they're just so much more immediate. But the thing about them too, I prefer them, much prefer them, this is no offense, over people, you know? I just much prefer dogs over people. It's just unconditional fucking love. Like you people, you're cunning, deceitful fucks. All... and no offense, you're ruining people's lives as we speak. The person next to you, "Yes, Julie, no, I... definitely, definitely, we're together forever." Bullshit! But dogs, they're so in the fucking moment, we are never in the fucking moment. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you have a bad disease. But dogs... Let me check Twitter. No, no, no, no, no. Hopefully you'll pull through. Ooh, seven notifications. Hah, hah, hah, hah... But I have Charlotte, and I've, I've turned Char... I've turned... Anybody else do this where you... Round of applause, if... I know. This is a real one, though. If you own a dog. If you own a dog. Not enough of you. There's a lot of strays. Get on it. It's not about you. Care for others, assholes. Enough grilled cheese and peanut butter and jelly gourmet sandwiches... and smoking pot and jerking off to Twitter thumbnails. I'm sorry. I'm going off again about myself. But I've turned my dog, I've turned my dog into my shrink. I'm talking to her now as if she was my shrink, because I'm bored to tears with my real shrink. You know, I mean, we understand each other. I'm there to fill an hour, she gets some insurance money. Whatever it is but, but now I talk to my dog like she's my shrink. I'm saying shit to her like, "Charlotte... you don't think I have diabetes, do you? I mean... they fuck up blood work all the time. Those centrifuges they use... a lot of them are suspect. And, Charlotte, you don't think the cops saw me sideswipe that car... in the shopping supermarket parking lot. I mean, the police would be here already, right? Charlotte, it's not too bad that I threaten people anonymously online... is it? Charlotte, I have enough money in my bank account, right?" By the way, if Charlotte knew how much money I have in my bank account instead of running and chasing balls, she'd just be in the apartment smoking fucking cigarettes. She'd just be like going, "Great. I thought I landed on my feet here. What the fuck? I can't believe it. Another guy on the cusp." The other thing that has been making me feel good lately even though I rail against corporate culture, once in awhile I like when I get a nice product. And I gotta, I got a new Honda Element vehicle and I fucking love it, because it's, it's kinda big, you know, and I like that because there's room to weep. There is so much room to weep in this car. There's a lot of space for bad... I can regret my past-life decisions in this car with satellite radio... Just kick it back... You know, I really feel like products should be just more honest in their advertising. I would respect corporations more. Like if an oil company was just fucking honest in their ads, you know what I mean? Like, this would be a great ad, I think, for an oil company. You know, a guy, you know, CEO of an oil company is out in a suit and next to him is a dolphin tied up with high tensile steel cables still alive and there's oil all over it and he's got a gun to the dolphin's head and he's like, "All right! I hear a lot of you are talking about switching to solar and wind. All right? And also, some of you... Not a lot of you, because you're too involved in grilled cheese, but some of you are fucking demonstrating against fracking just because it's destroying your water supply. Now let me tell you something. You keep that behavior up, you keep switching to solar or wind or demonstrating against fracking, and we kill a dolphin every five minutes... Boom! That's one. That was pregnant as well. That's right. We don't give a fuck. We destroyed Prince William Sound. We destroyed the Gulf of Mexico. You're fucking next." They always smile... and the... I never booked commercials because I was always too angry, but I did think... No, because it's that world that's not connected to... It's that happy world that's not connected to any reality, and I would just show up at auditions just furious. You know? But I did think of a commercial I could do and, um, I-I-I think... It would be for Vicodin because I, um, I got addicted to Vicodin for a few months a couple of years ago, because I couldn't afford a real vacation, um, which is what drugs... That's what drugs are... they're vacations for poor people. They're mini vacations. "Come home again." "Come, come to Vicodin. Come. Escape your life." I don't know why I'm doing that accent. It doesn't matter. It came out in the moment, and that's what's important. I have a great life coach who committed suicide recently trying to get me to do pull ups. He took his life... because of the lack of progress. But... Here's how the Vicodin commercial will go. I-I could definitely book this. Like a camera is just panning in slowly toward me. I'm looking at the camera and I'm like... "Vicodin. Come to think of it, I am a little sore." And it stays on me as my face gets more and more insane. Like,. They should let actors go. They should let actors go on commercials. Like, instead of just saying their horrific, stupid bullshit like, "Use this credit card..." They should just keep the cameras on 'em, you know? Like, "Use this credit card because I'm dying! I am dying and I have to do this bullshit and all my friends congratulate me when I become a corporate stooge!" But I've gotten, another thing that's calmed me down a little is... I've gotten married recently and... And we've been married a couple years, but we've been together for about nine years and, I... I don't know if you guys experience this, but when you're with someone for that long, you just run outta shit to say. You just do. And we are now at the point where we just toss facts back and forth to each other. Like, let's say we're driving... I live in L.A., not to come at you that I live in a Solis sunbaked landscape of apocalyptical proportions, but, I mean, we'll just be in a car for an hour... hour-and-a-half, nothing, and all of a sudden, I'll hear from my wife, "Do you know the grey parrot lives to a hundred?" And I'm like, "Really? Is this what it's come to?" And I get competitive, you know? Like I didn't know the grey parrot lives to a hundred. And I'm afraid she's gonna go to sea turtles, and I'm not gonna know that. I know they live very long. I'm not sure. So I fucking... I'm like, "Baby, don't start with the length of different creatures lives, because I know shit about Sacco and Vanzetti that'll knock your fucking socks off. Did you know that Sacco invented the panini press?" I just make shit up. "Yes, he invented the panini press, a radical leftist, and Vanzetti always worked on his abs constantly." I just... I do the acting thing in L.A. which means I spend a lot of time in my apartment just looking through the blinds going, "What the fuck... is Margaret doing the laundry for?" Like, just bullshit 'cause I got... I'm usually covered in blood. I have no idea why. By the way, I don't think people should be embarrassed, especially in this day and age, being covered in blood. I mean, it's a rough time out there with the... I'd like to be the Union Leader for the people covered in blood. "Look! Let's not be embarrassed that we're covered in blood. It's a fucking tough fucking economy out there! If you can't wipe if off or stop the bleeding, still go on the job interview! Make a life of it! Have a cloth with you! I will represent you! We're all covered in blood"... Just blood coming down. But I've always wanted to be a singer, but I could never really, really keep a tune or anything, and... but I'm gonna try, try to do - a little here... - Woo! Just 'cause I got you guys here. I got you guys here, and I always wanted to be, like the Vegas... The Vegas, like, lounge singer type, but I never... I wanted to be like the guy who sang about real shit, because I feel like the Vegas guys sing about bullshit. They're always like, ♪ I'm in so much love with you ♪ ♪ I'm in so much love with you ♪ Bullshit! Don't fuckin'... I'd just sing about real shit and I would be the singer who would, be like this. You know, I'd be the Vegas singer. I'd be like, ♪ I am fifty-five ♪ And never learned how to fold clothes ♪ ♪ I take a nice shirt ♪ I fold the left sleeve then I fold the right ♪ ♪ Then I fold it over ♪ And then I just wind up crumpling it into a ball ♪ ♪ Because it looks like shit when I'm folding it ♪ ♪ I never get... ♪ I'm fifty-five ♪ I still don't know where a crease in a pants is ♪ ♪ Where is the crease in pants? ♪ ♪ Hey! ♪ How come ♪ whenever I take a shower ♪ And see a little black mark on my skin ♪ ♪ I think I'm gonna die? ♪ Hey, hey, hey! ♪ I immediately go to death ♪ Black mark, holy shit ♪ ♪ Scrub it a little, gets kinda weird ♪ ♪ Then it hurts and then I go ♪ ♪ "Definitely gonna die! ♪ Definitely gonna die!" ♪ And that's even though I've done that many years ♪ ♪ With other little things on my body ♪ ♪ I've never died ♪ But I always think this is the one ♪ ♪ This is definitely the one ♪ I can't figure out ♪ Why I wanna be alive ♪ Yet I'm afraid of dying ♪ What the fuck is that? ♪ I can't figure out ♪ Why I wanna be alive ♪ Yet I'm afraid of dying ♪ Is it because ♪ Is it because every organism ♪ ♪ Goes toward life? ♪ Is it because every organism ♪ ♪ Goes toward life? ♪ I say, "Bring on death!" ♪ ♪ I wouldn't have to worry ♪ ♪ About all kinds of shit ♪ ♪ Why aren't I loved by everyone? ♪ Fuck you! ♪ Why not? ♪ I even get angry at women ♪ Who don't look at me ♪ As an escalator is passing them by ♪ ♪ If I'm going up one way ♪ She's going down the other ♪ ♪ If I make eye contact and she looks away ♪ ♪ I don't like her ♪ I have no idea who she is ♪ ♪ But I've already got a resentment ♪ ♪ That lasts for hours ♪ Sometimes I think about that person at night ♪ ♪ How sick is that? ♪ I'm not sure why I like to watch murder ♪ ♪ Real-life murder on television ♪ ♪ Not the fake stuff, the real stuff ♪ ♪ This dentist had a secret life ♪ ♪ His wife didn't know about it ♪ ♪ I'm in, I'm in ♪ ♪ Can't turn it off ♪ Gotta see what this stupid fuck dentist ♪ ♪ From Florida did ♪ And how come I watch these shows ♪ ♪ With something called an eating shirt? ♪ ♪ I like to watch Forensic Files ♪ ♪ At two or three in the morning ♪ ♪ With an eating shirt ♪ It's got holes in it and specs of blood ♪ ♪ This way when I'm eating ♪ ♪ Soft things which I love late at night ♪ ♪ I love to eat soft things and watch real-life murder ♪ ♪ And I have a fake tooth in the front of my mouth ♪ ♪ That I take out and put on the bureau ♪ ♪ With no water or anything ♪ ♪ What am I thinking? ♪ But I get so involved with Forensic Files ♪ ♪ That I don't care about this little thing called ♪ ♪ The Flipper Tooth ♪ Soft food just dribbles down my eating shirt ♪ ♪ And I love to watch ♪ The murder, the murder, the murder ♪ Thank you. I think I missed my real calling, though. "Calling" not coiling. Yes, I'm indigenous to this area. You got a problem with that? But, I-I-I think I missed my real calling. I think shoulda been a reporter in the field for disasters. Because I watch disasters on T.V. and they send reporters there, like Anderson Cooper who, like, look all coiffed and you really get no sense of the disaster because the guy or the woman they send there looks so put together. They should send... They should have someone like me. You know what I mean? Like, just some fucking horrific disaster, you know? And they just throw it to me and I'm like, "My fucking God! Ho-ly...sh-it! Ho..." And the twist is that I haven't even left my apartment. Like I... I'm just reporting about what I see around me. "-Ho-ho-ho! - My cats! I have five cats and they've spit up all over the place! What the fuck! One of them is urinating on a chair constantly! No matter what we do! We buy all kinds of shit at the pet store! And I'm not gonna put her down! I'm a Vegan! I can't do it legally once you declare! I dropped Cheerios... I dropped Cheerios this morning, and I can't fucking get to them under the frigerator!" I think, the time has come in this country. I think that things, you know, have gotten so bad. I think they're gonna get worse. I think we should close down the comedy clubs and open up stand-up tragedy clubs. You know, enough of this comedy... people talking about Batman and pussy. I like to get high and drunk. Fuck it. Let's fucking... Let's open up tragedy clubs. And this is my impersona... Let's, you know, just open up tragedy clubs and instead of names like, Chuckles and The Funny Bone and all that shit, it's just called like... The names of the clubs across the country'll be like, "Fuck!" "You going to 'Fuck' tonight?" Or just Ulcers... Perfor... "You going to 'Perforated Ulcers'?" Or another... 'Nother name for a club "Noooo!" "Well, why don't we head down to 'Noooo!' Let's head down to 'Noooo!'" But this would be my impersonation of a, of a stand-up tragedy club. It would go like this... Hi. Good evening, folks. Um... I just had to, drown my wife in a tub... because we ran out of money and we have, um, no support system. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. After this set, I'll be looking for food on the road. Thank you. Thank you. I'm surrounded... by so much death... that it hurts... very much. Thank you very mu... These are the tragedies, folks. Get with them. These are the tragedies. Please, folks... And my catchphrase, instead of "Git-R-Done"... The truth... But my tragedy and catchphrase would just be like, "God, please save me!" And everybody at work the next day would be like, doing that, like, you know, instead of "Git-R-Done" they'd be like, "" around the cooler, you know, that's filled, at this point, with just sulphuric acid. They'd be around the cooler going, "God, please save me!" "Wasn't he great? Wasn't he really sad? Wasn't he really sad?" But I wish... I wish... You know, I've gotten so far to the left with all the shit that's gone on in this country. Um, I wish my politics would, would bleed into, like game shows, because I like to watch game shows. Like I said, I have, like, this competitive element, you know, to me and like, I would... I would love to see, for instance, like on The Price Is Right, I would love to see a woman from Oklahoma have to guess the price of the Iraq War... instead of a blender. Like, it would be great. You know, she'd be like, you know, like the curtain would open and it's just fucking real-life carnage that industrial warfare does. Like, just a real-life industrial warfare carnage. Like, just people running around on fire, limbless, and she's just jumping up and down going, "I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know." And people in the audience are yelling, "Five billion a day! Five billion!" "Didn't we wrap up the Iraq War?" "No! There's a standing army there! No, no, no! Many, many troops! Under the guys of training them know it's still five..." "Does that include Afghanistan?" "10 billion, 10 billion, 10 billion a day with Afghanistan!" "Is Guantanamo Bay still open?" "Yes, contrary to what was said! Yes, but I would say 10 billion!" "I don't know! I don't know!" And then a vet, then a vet gets up in the audience and he's like, "You can't put a price on it! Don't play their fucking game! War is just big business! They just give us one fucking enemy after another! It used to be the Russians! It was Gaddafi! It used to be Castro! Now it's fucking Al Qaeda! They just put a face on fucking fear and they just wanna make money! And they have poor people fighting rich man's wars! That's what a..." And she starts... She's still jumping up and down, but... she's starting to like, get the message that... this isn't a good fucking thing. "Don't you fucking do it. All right? It's not right. Don't you fucking..." "$350." They always guess $350. I...I actually think that, you know, pretty soon, because of the unemployment, you know, call me an optimist, but I think pretty soon, you know, they are gonna just be legions of people who were unemployed and, you know, they're not gonna have homes. I mean, even worse than it is now, and they're all gonna be kinda kept behind, you know, certain barricades, but there's gonna be millions of them. You know, they will have Twitter and Facebook so don't worry about that. Sound familiar? But there's gonna be legions of them. And my job, I believe, for me to stay alive is I will be the entertainment. Like, they will still have to be entertained. Like these people... And there will be a big podium. It'll be like a science fiction movie. There'll be a big podium, but, instead of, like, doing stand-up for them, I'm just gonna come out in a horsey suit and sing to these legions of people. And it would go like this. It would go like this. Like, just imagine legions of dispossessed people, but they're Americans, so they love to be entertained. And they're, they're entertained easily, you know. So I would just come out in a horsey suit and I would start singing and it would be like this... ♪ Well ♪ The manufacturing base in this country ♪ ♪ Is gone "I'll give ya that!" ♪ There's... ♪ The food supply has been poisoned ♪ ♪ By Monsanto "I'll give ya that!" ♪ Those GMO crops turned out ♪ ♪ To not be too good ♪ That pesticide called "Roundup" ♪ ♪ Has led to Autism "I'll give ya that!" ♪ There's a pandemic of viruses ♪ ♪ And anxiety in this country ♪ ♪ And all the money's been cut for mental health ♪ "I'll give ya that!" ♪ It's just a nation ♪ Full of temporary workers ♪ ♪ Who don't have any benefits ♪ ♪ Because ♪ Instead of organizing and being a community ♪ ♪ You are on Facebook and Twitter ♪ ♪ And eating grilled cheese ♪ "I'll give ya that!" ♪ Sing the Horsey Song ♪ Sing the Horsey Song ♪ The Horsey Song I really hate magicians. I don't know if you saw the segue there. Just make it up. I hate magicians. They have that long, stringy hair, and they're always doing shit like, "Ooh, the quarter. The quarter got bigger. The quarter got bigger. The quarter got bigger." "Hey, magician! Who gives a fuck?! You wanna do a trick? Make me feel safe in this world!" But they can't do that. They can't do that shit. They're always just doing stuff like, The doves. The dove came outta the hat. Where did it come from? "Maybe you brought it. That's my fucking guess. And I'm also guessing that you keep it drugged with an eyedropper with something like Valium in it or something else I like a lot. You keep those poor things drugged. And they're a symbol, doves. Doves in a hat are fucked up. They should be flying free. They're a symbol of peace for the children." Always makes someone bad when you mention children. It's for the children! If someone catches you taking their mail just yell, It's for the children! They wouldn't know what the fuck you're talking about, But they'll be a little hesitant to come at you. Even if you home invasion them. "It's for the children!" And I also feel like if I brought my wife near a magician he'd be like, "I fucked your wife. You didn't see it." "Yes, I did, asshole!" "I fucked her again." "All right, that one I didn't see. Good for you. That was a good trick." I also can't stand the way, you know, the snootiness of certain products have gotten lately. Like, like that way fucking people are sold wine or the way they get into wine, um, is hilarious to me. Like I actually was at a dinner party the other day and my friend actually said, "You know... I think this wine has a playful finish." If you ever hear a friend saying that, tell him to work in a prison. Because he is not tethered to reality. It's done. It's gone. He's living in "gourmet" specialty world. I like to fuck with people at a dinner party and take a sip of wine and go, "You know, I disagree. I think it has a 's-s-silly' finish. No, really. I think this wine tastes like a car full of clowns. Do you detect notes of a hand buzzer? I do. A slight hand buzz. No one else sensed the floppy shoes in this wine? No one. It's me?" I actually had a friend say to me about a wine, he was like, and they always say it like this, "It just, this wine has just the slightest... trace..." As if he would want anything with a slight, slight trace. You know what I mean? Like, "It has the slightest, slightest hint of the forest floor." And I was like, "Forest floor? That's where people get murdered! Haven't you seen Twin Peaks? Leland Palmer killed Laura Palmer... in the forest. It was brutal. And I think it happens in real life. I do not want murder in my wine." And fucking Yelp is supposed to help us select products. That's hilarious to me. Like, have you ever read Yelp? Like, let's say a review on a Mexican restaurant and the first Yelp review will be like, "This taco was so good that I wanted to have sex with it." And then the next Yelp review will be, "This taco killed my entire family. They're all dead. I'm alone now wondering in a landscape of broken dreams because of this restaurant." What do you do? It's sex. Is that sex? Apparently, the quality varies greatly day to day... "I'll give ya that!" And they also sell cigars like that to men. You know, like, you know, guys who smoke cigars. You know, they're like, "It's-it's... This cigar, it's just, you know, it's got an oaky... it's got an oaky rhythm." They start throwing in jazz terms. "It's got an oaky rhythm. There's a cacophony, of very psychotic butterflies"... Or whatever the fuck they say. They just make this shit up. And they always have, like to sell cigars, you know, in "Cigar Aficionado" magazine there's always someone, like some celebrity like George Clooney in a tux with a cigar. You know what the cover of "Cigar Aficionado" should be? It should be a guy in a wife beater at a track about to hit a small child with a little cigar out of his mouth. "Cigars, because life is tough!" And also, I-I-I-I als... al... Also, I do not wanna buy a cup of coffee with a back story anymore. Okay? I can't deal with all the information I get in gourmet coffee shops about, you know, where the coffee was grown, how it was grown, who died for this fucking coffee. No more back story, you know, to this cup of coffee. You know, I mean, I-I-I... It's just too hilar... And, and I like to fuck... I like to go into these gourmet coffee shops and fuck with the barista. And, by the way, "Barista" is an Italian word for, "There is no manufacturing base anymore." So, we're giving you the name "Barista" so you feel somewhat good about yourself that you're making coffee for entitled scumbags. But, anyway. What, what... what I like to do is just run into coffee shops and just go, "Hey! What elevation was this coffee grown at?!" And the sad thing is, you know, they usually know. "That's 7,000 feet, sir." And I'm like, "7,000 feet?! Do you think I'm an asshole?! I don't drink anything under 11-k! I don't drink any coffee under 11,000 feet! I'm not a fucking idiot! Either is my wife! Either are my children! Either you get this grown at a higher elevation, or I organize the community that'll get your fucking asses outta this neighborhood! You people are trash, you grow it at 7,000 feet! Fuckin' morons!" I also hate, self-help gurus. They are especially prevalent in L.A. You know, the people who are... Who do shit like, "I can change your life with my three-point plan." Bullshit! What they should really say is, "I could change your life with my three-point plan, but, you already have to have a lot of money and a good support system around you. My plan does not work for broken shattered people. It only works for obtusely bored rich people... sort of it works. I'm not helping the homeless." But I feel like these self-help gurus would be around no matter what. Like, if there was an apocalypse, let's say, I don't know what's gonna come first. Either the Ecocatastrophe, that probably will come first, or a financial meltdown globally, which will lead to widespread riots and just pure carnage. Or, you know, or nuclear strike which is eminent. By the way, thank you for coming. I think... I don't know. I don't know which will come first, but I feel like there still will be a self-help guru around. Let's say there's like 15 people left on the planet. This is my impersonation of a self-help guru with like 15 people left on the planet. "All right! So, we have no water. We have no gas. We have no edible food. We have no electricity, except for this mic... Don't ask me how that works. The oceans have risen, temperatures outside are 110 degrees. There are rabid dogs running around. Itinerant gangs are raping the survivors. Lawlessness, carnage. But I say, 'Why not realize your goals?' A lot of people are using this apocalypse to cower in fear and kill and slaughter each other. I say, 'Lose that last 10 pounds!' And, by last 10 pounds, I mean, literally, the last 10 pounds. Now I have a three-point plan that can get you through the apocalypse. Number 1, Learn how to play a musical instrument. I believe a twig can be fashioned into a flute. Number 2, With that skill find a mate. Now, gentlemen, I know we haven't seen women since the nuclear strikes, but I believe if you play a flute they will come. Something about music. And, Number 3, When you find a woman, have a baby and start a new civilization." Funny story... These soulless corporate fucks always have a funny story that's always horrible. Funny story... I was, walking through the forbidden zone, It gets better. And I saw a man eating a small child. Hold for it. Hold for it. I said to him, "Is that your boy?" He said, "It was." I said, "Do you feel like giving up?" He said, "I do." I said, "What if I had a three-point plan that could get you through the apocalypse?" He said, "I'm willing to try." And today, he is doing very well staring at the sun... and masturbating on a diamond." I also hate how the NFL particularly has been turned into a commercial for the military. Like, it's un-fucking real. The last Super Bowl, which was played in Giant Stadium... I'm a big Giant fan, they're always flying B-52 bombers for some reason overhead of the games. You know, and by the way, if they were gonna do that, the least they could've done is drop a couple of good players for the Giants if you're gonna fly over. They sucked this year. Yes! I am pandering to the sports crowd occasionally. And they always have a big announcement too, for it. Like this, this great big announcement like, "Ladies and gentlemen, flying overhead is the 101st airborne division with B-52 bombers!" I wish, I wish these announcers would tell the truth. Like, I wish they would be like, "Ladies and gentlemen, flying overhead are B-52 bombers! Each one of these B-52 bombers could be 50 libraries in your community! You would actually have an infrastructure that didn't look like it was held together with spit! But instead, all you have is an outward manifestation of imperialistic evil! Enjoy the game!" My point is, they cost a lot of money... to kill people. And the other group of people I-I can't get down with are the real New Agey people who are not really connected to reality, because I have terrible insomnia and every once in awhile, I will call up one of my New Age friends, and I'll be like, "I-I can't sleep. What should I do?" And they're like, "Eddie, just drink Sleepytime Tea. And I'm like, " Sleepytime tea? Really? Is that gonna make up for the fact that I was molested... and I owe three guys five grand by Friday? And I endured being kept in a steel box for my first 25 years of my life with two pinprick holes in them? Through one of the holes I was kept alive with an eyedropper of high fructose corn syrup... which it turns out is very bad for you. And through the other hole I just could barely make out a naked man in a clown mask waving his cock spelling out, 'Please help me' in sperm! And every once in awhile, he would have a veal scallopini on a marble surface!" Then the New Age people get really nervous and they're like, "Try it with lemon and honey," and they hang up. All right, everybody, thank you so much! I did. I did think I was very good. I really did. But thank you so much. Thanks again, everybody! ♪ ♪
