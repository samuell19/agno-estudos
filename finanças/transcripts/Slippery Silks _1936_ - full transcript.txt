[♪] [TYPEWRITER CLICKING] Isn't much to go on, but the Bureau of Missing Persons is at your service. That's the only photograph we could find among their uncle's effects. He died very suddenly. Probably took a look at the picture and couldn't stand the shock. Mulvaney, these three boys have just inherited the Madame de France, that swanky modiste shop on Fifth Avenue. See if you can find 'em. It's done. MOE: Well, that's marvelous. I always wanted to make a cabinet like that. Idea has been in my head since I've been 10 years old. Oh, sort of aged in the wood. Yeah, but-- See that? Oh... Ow! What's the matter with you? I-- What's going on here? We're ready to build that cabinet. Well, then get busy. Okay, Mr. Romani. Get that thing here, would ya? LARRY: Your fault. The cops. Come on, let's hide. [WHOOPS] All right, officers. I'll be all right now. And thank you very much. Oh, why, how do you do, Mr. Morgan? I've been expecting you. I'm so glad you arrived safely with the cabinet. Yes, I can breathe easier now. The museum made me post a $50,000 bond for its safety. Is that so? Look at that. This is probably the most valuable piece of antique Chinese woodwork in the world. I want an exact duplicate made of it. Well, you've certainly come to the right place. Uh, boys, where are you? Right here. Ow! Ooh. Sorry, boss. They were piled too high. Uh, just a little careless. Yes. Now, uh, Mr. Morgan wants an exact duplicate of this cabinet. I get ya, a twin. Don't worry, boss, when we get through, its own mother won't be able to tell 'em apart. Are you sure this work will be in competent hands? Certainly, we're all incompetent. Ooh! Now, Mr. Morgan, we're not as dumb as we look here. Just step into the office and, uh, we'll talk this thing over. [DOOR CLOSES] That's a genuine Ching Hi-Lee. A Chow Mein Hi-Lo. Hi-Lee.

Yeah, we're pedestrians. You can't put us in jail. Jail? We just wanted to tell you that you inherited your uncle's gown shop. Uncle Pete's gown shop? MEN: Yeah. [WHOOPING] Not the Madame de France?

How strange. Aha, there it is, a trifle too much train. Gee, I think there's two boxcars and a caboose to many. The cow-catcher is dragging. Well, at any rate we'll have it fixed before you can say: Ugh! Thank you. Did he say, ugh? I think I'll take off the caboose. Come right up to the fitting room, please, and bring the tape measure. Yes, you come with him. Tape measure. Thing with the numbers. Smart girl. Miss Izzybottle is coming d-- Uh, you're going to be wild about this. Now, we're gonna have it sent to you parcel past, express or via airplane, yes, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. Very artistic, isn't it? Oh, very spiffy, very spiffy. [CHUCKLING] Yeah.

I would not. Those three vandals who wrecked that Chinese cabinet are somewhere in this town and I'm gonna find 'em. Come on, boys, get busy. We've got to create some new models for a fashion show. I never got a chance to learn about women's dresses. Designed furniture, didn't ya? So what? Well, dresses are the same thing. Crazier they look, the more women will pay for them. Ow! [WHIMPERING] Come on. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. I-- I didn't mean it. Ooh! Plotz, please. [♪] I think I'd look stunning in that riding habit. I think there'd be trouble figuring out which one was the horse. [GIGGLES] Very witty, my partner. Heh. Pick out two. One, two. [CRUNCHING] Ooh. Oh! Oh, he broke it. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. He broke it. Oh! [WHIMPERING] Isn't that beautiful? This is what I've been waiting for, the designs by the new owners. Petite. Ah. Madam, isn't that scrumptious? Mmm. Putrid. Lovely. Could you create something individual for me? Lady, you're practically created. [STOOGES GIBBERING] [CHUCKLES] Oh, delightful, madame. [GIGGLING] [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Hmm. What'll I do with it? Tie it off someplace. Get rid of it. "Pin se soi." "Pin se soi"? Oui. "Pin se--" Pin it. Is my wife here? Yes, Mr. Morgan. She's in the fitting room being created. "Pin soi." "Pin soi." Merci, merci.
