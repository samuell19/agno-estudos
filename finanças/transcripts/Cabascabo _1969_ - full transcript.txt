So, when we were at war! They buried this type of rock, which exploded and sent you to heaven. And they're chicken! You walk on it and you're blown away. You, you speak of nothing but Indochine. No we weren't there, yet we were still wounded. We come here to drink and then leave. Hey ! Let people talk! You have no money and you're pissing us off. I have money to pay for my drink. You English have got fuck all! And you, French soldiers! You're asking for it! You English, don't even have shoes. In Indochine, I remember... Truth be told, you were brave. You might have been made corporal. Listen, sargent, I don't care about stripes. I wish God would return me to my country. So this isn't your country? Aren't you a French soldier? What? This, my country? You're joking! This is your country. Enough of this talk. Leave me alone, or else... Fine, but I'll land you in jail! Who's talking about prison when our friends are dead? What did you do to this sargent? What sargent? The smoker, there... I don't care about him. What's wrong? Nini ! Come. Hello, Boukari. Tell me, Boukari, is there anything to drink, yes or no? Give us two beers. Is there any soum-soum ? My word, old man, you're daughter is beautiful! Yes but it's her that drains my cash. Bring another drink and some soum-soum. Here, Nini, take this. You're giving him everything? You're a real idiot! Doesn't matter... So, now what are we doing? We're thanking God, God's name. Halidou, you heard this? We've already done it 100 times! We really did something. When you came back from Indochine, I was happy. You had money. Like a good griot, I bid you welcome. I gave you food. Now take the bottle and drink. You musn't spoil your heart. So you played the horn? It's true. I remember my return. I brought back a lot of money. I had my leave, but... Well, you had what you wanted! At least they couldn't take me back. God is great! Am I dreaming or what? No. It's me. When did you arrive? The day before yesterday. God got me out of there! It was heating up, back there! Same as always. But by the grace of God, I'm here. And now, where will you stay? Well... on our plot. You'll be disturbed. Come with me. There's a house for rent. OK! That's better. Especially for someone single! Hello. Health. Nothing but health! My friend has returned from Indochine, And I almost forgot! He's looking to rent a house. Welcome. I have a house for rent. It's 2 000 F per month. Come on. Let's go have a beer. You drink now? - Why not? - Me, I'll never drink. What made me drink? Even you, if you went to war, you'd drink! Yes. but I drink youki. Bring a beer and a youki. Tell me, friends. Do you drink beer? That's what we're here for! Bring the beer. The bottle opener. Good. Leave it. We'll open it ourselves. Alpha. Those girls there, they're "worldly girls"? Because it has to work with them. We can call them? Hawa, come here! Where is he coming from? Indochine. Where is ''Imbécine'' ? No not ''Imbécine'', it's ''Indochine''. First you go to France, go by the Suez Canal... then go further than Mecca. and there, to pray, you turn towards the setting sun. You know this man? It's Dan-Baba. He sings better than Tino Rossi. He can sing for us? Stop the record! He's going to sing for us. Dan-Baba ! My friend here came back from Indochine. He's called Cabascabo. You must sing for him. Cabascabo, you slept well? I'll see if I can get you something. At least for two days. It'll be goo for your work. God willing! I'll find you something. Even if it's nothing but rags! Ah you haven't finished giving gifts! This he brought back from Marseille It's just my style! Cabascabo, welcome! You came back in good health. Cabascabo, beware of your friends. They only want your money. Be calm. A soldier from Indochine can always find work police officer, in the colonies... Let's go to Cabascabo's place. Why? There's nothing there. Yesterday we saw it in the cinema. It was Hamani that offered it to him. Fine. But you don't go see someone just because he has money. Cabascabo, did you sleep well? No. I'm not alright. I need to speak with you. Do you know someone who'll buy a uniform? No but I could perhaps sell it at the market. I bought it for 8 000 F. But sell it for 5 000. -
