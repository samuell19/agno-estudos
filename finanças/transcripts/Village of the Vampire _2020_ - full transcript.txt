(Rebecca) Thanks for calling back. (Rebecca) Yes, I know. (Rebecca) For what time? Agree. See you later then. Excuse the wait, Alfredo. - Meeting over? - Yup. And we have decided to print an article about your sister every week,... ..in the hope that someone decides to roll up their sleeves. Thanks, Alfredo, really. But I don't think it does much good. You're the best at the newsroom, Rebecca. The journalist most hated and envied by the competition. And also the sexiest. Seeing you smile is already a great achievement. Rebecca, needless to tell you, but for anything, you can count on us, on me. You know. Some news? Who was on the phone? A guy I have to meet tonight. Apparently he has some important information about Elena. I hope it is something concrete and that it is not yet another "hole in the water". Does the guy have a name? Giordano De Angelis. I do not know anything else. But he doesn't seem to be the shady type. That is fine. Then keep me updated. Ah, Rebecca, take advantage of these two weeks off to rest, okay? Sometimes thinking about yourself clears your head. No use having to remind you to make yourself heard, right? (HIGH VOLUME MEDIEVAL MUSIC) Hi, I'm looking for Giordano De Angelis! He told me to ask for him at the counter! - Who?! - Giordano De Angelis! - And who is it?! I've never actually met him before. He gave me an appointment for 9:30 pm, I'm a little early. - Wait... Luna! Come here for a moment. - (Moon) Tell me! The girl here... asks me if a certain Gianluca has arrived and something... Giordano De Angelis. - Yes, that. -Yes, he booked a table for two this morning. He is already here. - Good. What is the table? - I'll take you. - Bah! (HIGH VOLUME MEDIEVAL MUSIC) I bring you the menus! - Rebecca? - Affirmative. - Giordano. Take a seat. Thank you for coming. In fact I am upset and I was convinced that you would not come. Actually, I'm upset because I'm a big fan of yours. I've read all your articles and loved your every special one,... .. especially the one dedicated to the serial killers of the 70s. You were able to tell those terrible events from the point of view of the victims,... .. showing the cruelty of their executioners. - What do you take? - I have already had dinner. - Ah. Grab something to keep me company so then let's talk about everything we need to talk about. Thank you, but I prefer to talk about it now and then go home. Ok. A beer instead? This is the file I was telling you about on the phone. Contains some very important documents... .. and I assure you that it was not at all easy to recover them. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (Giordano) The first time I read these documents,... ..I had the chills for three consecutive days... (Giordano) Unfortunately, it often happens that people disappear without a trace. Some for love, some for debt, some for fear or for something much worse. (Giordano) But how likely is it that people will mysteriously disappear... ..near a small village lost in the mountains? (Giordano) Well, with the help of some rather particular "friends",... ..I discovered that there is a place on the border with Switzerland. A place that mysteriously was erased from all maps after the 1900s. (Giordano) A small village, probably uninhabited. Nobody talks about it, nobody mentions it. But on some old encyclopedias and some maps... ... which date back to the period of the Second War of Independence,... .. there it appears: Timere. No articles, no proof of its existence,... .. almost every trace has been erased. (Giordano) Only in some small amateur blogs,... ..where we talk about ghost towns, urban legends and scary stories,... ..the name of Timere appears. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Let's admit that's true, what does this place have to do with my sister? Your sister is Samira De Marchi's partner. Samira is my wife's sister. My sister-in-law told my wife that she was helping Elena with a missing persons case. I know your sister wanted to make a career in your industry... ..and become a great reporter like you. When they left,... ..my sister-in-law told her they were going to take a vacation in the mountains, but it wasn't true. This file is from your sister... ..and she gave it to Samira because she didn't want you to know about it. I tried to talk to the police about it, taking a copy of the file with me, of course... ..but they took me for crazy. So I thought that only a smart and motivated person like you... .. she could find my sister-in-law. Your sister went to that place, I'm sure of it. It's been three months, it took some time to complete the puzzle. You are the only one who can do something. (MUSIC OF "DON'T GO AWAY" BY MARCO STEFANO POLETTI FEAT AURORA ROCHEZ) (Rebecca) Hi, Alfredo, I'm leaving right now. I have decided to spend my holidays in the mountains. The guy I met last night gave me some very important information,... ..on my return I'll tell you everything. Don't worry, this "vacation" could be good for me. I will be back soon. A kiss. (MUSIC OF "DON'T GO AWAY" BY MARCO STEFANO POLETTI FEAT AURORA ROCHEZ) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) - (Man) Miss. - Greetings... Did I do something wrong, officer? For the moment I would say no. - Can you give me a driving license and registration document? - Of course. Commissioner Thomas Bionaz. - What, sorry? - My name and rank. Commissioner Thomas Bionaz, non-agent. I didn't think there was a French commissioner waiting for me at the entrance. What brings you here in the middle of the night? They say that breathing the mountain air is healthy. So I decided to spend my holidays away from the rest of the world. And did you choose Timere? Bizarre as a choice. - And what do you do in life? - I'm a reporter. Ah! I see. You know... Timere is a quiet place. Clean, peaceful, with little traffic from tourists. Timere's laws are very different from those issued by the host state. We have preserved the lifestyle and the laws of a historical context... ... quite different from what she is used to. (softly) A wonderful place. Perfect for a vacation. But even a place like Timere has its own rules. The curious and the strangers brings trouble, they are not welcome. Understood? Ah, cars cannot enter the town. There is a parking lot below reserved for tourists. Thank you, I'll keep your directions in mind. Good stay. Commissioner? It wasn't easy to get here and I couldn't book a room. Can you show me a place to stay? The Locanda dei Fratelli Rossetti. It is the only one in town. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Is anybody there? (NOISE OF BREAKING GLASSES) (CREAK OF A DOOR) (CREAK OF THE DOOR) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (Giacinta Rossetti) Are you looking for someone? (Rebecca) Yes... I thought there was no one. (Giacinta Rossetti) But there is someone. What are you doing in my inn at this hour? - We are closed. - (Rebecca) The door was open. Who do you want to steal from a place with a hundred inhabitants? All doors are open. Excuse me, I didn't know. - Are you lost, by any chance? - I'm actually looking for a place to sleep. Ah-ah... And for how many nights? (Rebecca) Well, I can't tell you that. Anyway, in the meantime, could I pay the room for... three nights? - Are you alone or in a group? - Alone. (Giacinta Rossetti) Mm... Then you are in luck. Two days ago a couple of strangers arrived. In our inn we only have two rooms available for sleeping. As you can imagine this is not a big metropolis. However you are lucky. Another person left the room just last night. Jolanda! My daughter will accompany you upstairs. You would not get lost, but I do accompany you for education. - First name? - Rebecca Leone. JOLANDA! WE HAVE A NEW CUSTOMER! COME HERE RIGHT NOW! A document, thanks. (DOOR SLAMSING) (Giacinta Rossetti) It was time! Yes mom? (Giacinta Rossetti) her Accompany the young lady in her room. (Giacinta Rossetti) Come on! Good night. Thanks. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOOR OPENING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) The towels have already been placed in the bathroom. You may sweat during the night because sometimes the heaters turn on, being faulty. But you can open the window if you feel too hot. I thank you. Good night. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DOOR OPENING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (Gaspare Innocenti) It's true, I can't deny it. It all started from a nightmare. (Gaspare Innocenti) From there... a demonic thriller. (Gaspare Innocenti) Even though I hate ghosts, they literally make me shit on me. (Gaspare Innocenti) And I'm not even a big fan of horror films. But that doesn't matter, that fucking nightmare made me "pull out" a book! However, my touch is recognized. And do you know from what? From the medium. Stop it! A great slut. Big tits, sexy voice... A true erotic dream. Can you explain to me how you can have a beer at eight in the morning? (Gaspare Innocenti) You will have an iron liver, my dear! (Rebecca) A coffee, thank you. Finally someone normal in this mountain hole. No offense, huh. Gaspar. Gaspare Innocenti: a name, a guarantee. This is worth seeing. Rebecca Leone. Rebecc... Rebecca Leone ?! But don't tell me, the reporter? Journalist? Here at Timere we don't want problems, understand? Yes, I know, they've been telling me since I got here. Damn, she's a journalist, not a killer! Well, as far as I'm concerned... ..reporters belong to a worse madwoman. How much do I owe for the coffee? I'll put it on the room bill. Journalist... (Marta) What a sympathy... - Anyway, I'm Marta La Rocca. -My spouse, luckily for her. Bad luck, I would say. As you can imagine, we quickly learned the three ways of the town,... so if you want, we could be your guide. Don't worry, the tour doesn't last long. In three minutes we can show you every corner of Timere, woods and annexed troglodytes. Said so, I gladly join. (RINTOCCHI OF BELLS) (MELANCHOLISH MUSIC) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) You have chosen a very characteristic place for your vacation. Ah, well, to be honest we weren't headed here. Gaspare hates navigators and loves being self-centered. I can't stand them, they talk all the time: turn this way, go there, at the roundabout on the right. - Shut up! Our destination should have been a small village in Switzerland,... ..but, of course, we got lost. So we asked a passerby for a place to stay overnight and he pointed us to Timere. We liked the place, although we are convinced that the brothers who run the inn... - You know, right? Otherwise that poor girl wouldn't explain! - Gaspar... (Gaspare) Ok, okay. I just told the truth. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (DIALOGUES NOT AUDIBLE) (Gabriel) You set your eyes on something dangerous. Gabriele, how are you? Ah, yes, he is a lay person who takes care of the management of the Church in the absence of the parish priest. He is less prehistoric than the others. Pleased to meet you, my name is Rebecca. Yes, I knew... "The rumors run fast." Apparently... - Why in Timere? - Vacation. Vacation?! Seriously? - Sorry, I need to make a phone call. - It is useless, "the line is totally dead". That man, the one with the hat, it's best to leave him alone. It was not my intention to get acquainted with him. Not you, but he'd like to meet you. Excuse me. Here they are all out of their minds. - (Marta) But who did you see? - (Rebecca, softly) A guy, nothing special. (DIALOGUES NOT AUDIBLE) Elena... (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BISBIGLII) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (Gaspar) Rebecca! All right?

(TINTING OF GLASSES) ("NIGHT" MUSIC OP. 9 N ° 2 BY FRYDERYK CHOPIN) You weren't completely honest with the church keeper before, were you? - (Martha) Mm! I would have bet on it. - You can tell us, though. In short, I did not even know the existence of this place. Actually, I don't think anyone knows him. Almost... - Seen? I told you he was here for some reportage. - Mm... you're off the road. I'm not here on behalf of the newspaper I work for. I am here because I am looking for a person. Ah, yes... I heard. - I'm sorry. - "Know" what? My sister. She's been missing for three months and nobody bothered to look for her. (Martha) Oh, I'm sorry. And you... do you think she might be here? I don't know... I hope so. But I don't know where to start. Unfortunately we didn't see a lot of people, but I can assure you this place is weird strong. Everyone looks at us with a certain curiosity, but it is not a simple curiosity, here. The other day, for example, we were talking to a girl... ..that she was staying in your room before you arrived. She-she seemed almost scared. - Yes, this is true! But she said she was fine,... ..then... she vanished into thin air. -In what sense do you "she vanished into thin air"? -That she left suddenly. - Without saying goodbye. And you? Why Switzerland? Since I couldn't stand her state of anxiety, I forced him to take a week's vacation in the mountains. Switzerland was a place like any other, but the place I had chosen from the photos looked cool. And instead we ended up in... Timere! (Man) In the hope that you have not regretted it. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Forgive the inconvenience. I haven't had the pleasure of meeting our new guests yet. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Rebecca... Beautiful name. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (Mayor) I walk away for a moment and lose sight of you! (THE MAYOR RIDACCHIA) Oh! I see you have had the pleasure of meeting our darling, Mr. Caleb. - The mayor is always too good. - (Mayor) I'm just telling the truth. You must know that Caleb runs our wonderful theater. He is a true art lover and a great romantic. Besides, the foundations of Timere were built thanks to his riches. - The real source of attraction for tourists. - In fact, the streets of the town are clogged with traffic. (CALEB RIDACCHIA) Mr. Innocenti is right. Apparently we would not say that our village is a busy place. (Mayor) Not for mere mortals,... ..but for wealthy entrepreneurs, enthusiasts and important exponents of the theater in Europe,... ..is a great tourist destination. I'm happy for you. (William) Is the wine to your liking? I would be a liar if I did not admit that perhaps it is the best wine I have ever drunk in my life. I'm glad to hear it. You see, that wine is owned by Mr. Caleb. It is obtained following an ancient procedure,... ..as tradition in his family over the course of many years. - Ah! - (Caleb) William... It's not the case... Anyway, I'm Marta. (HAPPY MUSIC) You must know that dear William has been taking care of me for many years now. He may seem a little grumpy at times, but deep down he's a good man. I almost forgot, this is Cora and Anastasia,... ..my sweet friends. (Gaspar) See? I've done everything wrong in life; I should have been selling wine. Pleased to meet you. Caleb, I think you should invite our guests to the big event. (Mayor) Sounds like a great idea to me! Tonight we will have the honor of hosting the Nashira in the magical theater of Timere,... ..with their wonderful classical dance performance. We would be happy to have you in the audience. Of course... we will reserve front row seats for you. (Mayor) It's an offer you can't refuse! - The last time I heard this sentence it didn't end very well. - Then I take it as a yes. Later. You have met a truly special person. (Marta) What a charm, guys... "They are my sweet friends"... What an exaggeration! What impression did it make to you? I don't know yet... (MUSIC OF "THE FOUR SEASONS - AUTUMN" BY ANTONIO VIVALDI) (Gaspar) Rebecca!

(DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GUTTURAL VERSES) (REBECCA SCREAMS) (REBECCA BREATHES HEAVY) (HAPPY MUSIC) (WHISTLE JACKET) (MELANCHOLISH MUSIC OF A PIANO) - Tell me. - (Rebecca) A coffee, thank you. - (Giacinta) Aren't your friends with you? - I think they're still asleep. (Jacinta) I saw you at the theater last night. - Did you like the show? - (Rebecca) A lot. (Jacinta) Caleb is a great man! A man loved by the citizens of Timere. I have noticed it. May I know where all this admiration comes from? We are indebted to Caleb. All we have, all we are, we owe to him. - But your lifestyle is different from that of the rest of the world. - The rest of the world is sick. Caleb showed us the way to happiness. All suffering, thanks to him, vanishes. We owe him everything. I owe him everything. If my daughter is alive, I owe it to Caleb. I'll be honest with you. I was unaware of Timere's existence prior to my sister's disappearance. A decision made a long time ago was not to show Timere in the maps. Yet it is busier than expected. As for your sister, however,... ..if this is where you are looking for,... ..I don't think it's the right place. (Rebecca) My sister is only 25 years old. She is young, and her last traces of her lead to Timere. Please, she's just a girl. If you know something or have seen it, please tell me. As I have already said, peace and tranquility reigns in Timere. It is good to know that "troublemakers" are not well regarded here. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I didn't see your sister,... ... and if I were you, I wouldn't go alone to a place I don't know,... ..where I suspect my sister is... missing! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (Gabriel) I wouldn't do it. If I were you, I wouldn't. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (Rebecca) Hey! (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (Rebecca) Wait! - I said wait! - Oh! Do you know where my sister is? Hit that man? - You ask too many questions. - No. The problem is that I've done too few since I arrived. But now I'm going to fix it. Follow me. (Rebecca) Isn't it okay here? No. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Why in church? This is a sacred place. A place that protects us from the evil one. Not very popular with the inhabitants of Timere. (Gabriel) Skeptical? Journalists always are. To tell the truth, almost everyone is today. Then a trip to Timere is enough to change your mind. - Really? - (Gabriele) I would say yes. (MELANCHOLISH MUSIC) My dear Rebecca,... .. this country is a very dangerous place. An unknown place,... ..known only to people in power or people hungry for cruelty. (Gabriele) Some call it the village of miracles. I prefer to call it the village of Hell. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Who is Caleb? Do not take his name in the house of the Lord! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) His name is a curse,... ..and it is forbidden to talk about him in here. So tell me, is he the one who took my sister? - I met Elena. - Thing?! A very sweet girl, but just as stupid as you are. When did you last see it? Rebecca, whoever enters Timere,... .. she stays in Timere. So why aren't you in danger like we strangers? Are you one of them? I have decided to step aside. Not to accept their rules,... .. unlike the priests who preceded me. So this is what you do? To save your skin are you willing to keep quiet and not save innocent lives? You cannot imagine who you are dealing with! That being is evil. And if she chose you as her next prey, oh,... ..then you will be an excellent dessert for him. If he is evil, then why does everyone worship him? Why do so many come from outside the country just for him? Most of the time a skeptical mind does not see and understand what it cannot explain. But there are things in the universe that cannot be explained,... ..but they are real. He is a dead undead. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (Gabriel) he IS the black man for children. (Gabriel) Darkness for adults. (Gabriele) The cold shiver of death that runs through the back. (Gabriel) An evil creature, which feeds on blood in order to live. (Gabriel) A beast, a monster. (Gabriel) Evil dressed as a man. (Gabriele) A strength beyond any human experience. (Gabriel) A direct disciple of the devil. You described it as if it were a... (Gabriel) Surprising, right? (Gabriel) And I've never said one... He watches you, Rebecca, as he watches us all. He has the ability to anticipate your every move. You have to be very careful with him. Very... careful. This... This... If everything you said is true, then why doesn't anyone face it? Have a good day, Rebecca. (MELANCHOLISH MUSIC OF A PIANO) - How did you know I was here? - You'll understand... This place doesn't offer many alternatives. And look, I noticed that you're keeping an eye on him. - All right? - Could be better. I've had a very busy morning. Mine wasn't the best either. Marta is not at all well. She got up with a severe headache, so I left her in the room to rest. -She thinks she hasn't even had lunch. -She is not the only one. You will see that she will get better. You women... are the greatest mystery in the universe. (chuckling) I don't think so, you know? What are you reading? If I may ask... My sister's notes, written before her departure. In her research we talk about the theater,... ..of wine and Timere,... ..but it is strange that there is no mention of Caleb. - Nobody talking about it. -Maybe he's a guy who doesn't like "gossip". (Rebecca) Maybe... But how does a man so adored,... ... so known, master of everything,... not to be mentioned anywhere? (DOOR OPENING) Journalist! You've got a message. (DREAM MUSIC) Where does this letter come from, from the 1800s? (DREAM MUSIC) (HAPPY MUSIC) (Caleb) Sweet Rebecca, your presence in Timere fills me with joy... and gives light to our small town. I would be happy if you accept my invitation to drink some good wine together... ..and to be able to enjoy your company. (Caleb) An hour after sunset I wait for you at the restaurant where we first met. Love, Caleb. An invitation... I don't like that guy at all. Will you go there? Please don't tell me you're thinking about it. He'll go... Bad idea. Bad idea... (MELANCHOLISH MUSIC) (Elena, in a low voice) Rebecca... (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (Commissioner Bionaz) The curious and the strangers "brings trouble"... .. they are not welcome.

This is up to me to decide. (CLASSIC MUSIC) Then please. (CLASSIC MUSIC) It starts as well. (CLASSIC MUSIC) Tell me about you. Who are you? - (Caleb) Is this an interview? - Maybe! Maybe yes maybe no... (CLASSIC MUSIC) I am an ordinary man. A very ambitious man,... .. lover of culture,... ..of art and theater. (Rebecca) I've heard this before. - Tell me who you really are. - (Caleb) This is who I am. Believe it... or not. (CLASSIC MUSIC) This is my sister Elena, and she has been missing for over three months. My parents died a long time ago,... ..and the only person she has left is me. My sister was a reporter like me, and she was investigating missing persons. Thus she became aware of a small unknown village: Timere. Anyone who has approached this place has never returned home. Tell me the truth. Who is Caleb? (Rebecca) A rich and famous young man, master of an empire that no one knows? Or this is what he wants you to believe. It is not so? You know, there are many stories about Timere,... ..and they tell just as much about you. Tell me who are you? And what did you do to my sister? (DREAM MUSIC) When I lived in Eastern Europe for work, I met a very important man. A man loved and feared by his people. He said a sentence to me. A phrase that I have never forgotten:... .. "Blood is life". (DREAM MUSIC) I did not understand its immediate meaning,... ..but over time... it became clear. The aftertaste of my wine has won you over. In truth... it conquers everyone. This is what makes my wine so special... ..and different from that produced in the rest of the world. It's a small ingredient:... ..the blood! (Caleb) A few drops, imperceptible. Most of the time we prefer to use the blood of young followers,... ..but to make it perfect you have to mix it with my blood. (CALEB RIDE) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) I remember your sister. I also remember her partner. (Caleb) They were terrified. (Caleb) Their hearts beat. But your sister... She was braver,... ..harder. (Caleb) she was not a simple beast to sacrifice. She deserved a better fate. A more ambitious destiny. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) So I took her to my kingdom. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Her blood... (SUSPENSE MUSIC) I still remember the sweet taste of her. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (CALEB'S MALICIOUS LAUGH) (REBECCA WETRIES) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (TOWARDS OF SCARED REBECCA) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) - Why are you in such a hurry? - Stay away from me.

(Caleb, in a guttural voice) You're a bad sister! (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (Man) Miss? Miss, sorry for bothering you, but I have a message for you. (DREAM MUSIC) (Caleb) My dear Rebecca, I apologize for not showing up for our appointment. Unfortunately, an unexpected situation held me back, forcing me to change my plans. (Caleb) I'm sorry for not having warned you in time, but I promise you I'll be able to make amends. (Caleb) I took the liberty of having good wine delivered to your room as a sign of apology. Hope to see you soon. Love, Caleb. - Tonight we celebrate! - Oh yes? And what are we celebrating? - (Gaspare) Our departure! - (Marta) Our departure ?! - Well yes! My inspiration is back, so tomorrow we will leave this black hole once and for all! But where did you find all this wine? - He was outside the door. - But how "out the door"! - They will have given us a gift, what do I know? Anyway, we have to drink, drink until we're sick,... ..but not before doing so many dirty things on and under the sheets.

I understand your agitation, I've been through it, but if you want to find Marta you have to trust me. I trust you, I just don't understand the connection.

"Je ne parle pas Chinese", or whatever it is. - What he said? - Do you really want to know? - No. (Gaspare) she is of the latest generation. I could understand his thirst for revenge towards his parents,... ..but I cannot understand why he is so revered by the inhabitants of Timere. By the inhabitants of Timere? Caleb is adored all over Europe. It is a myth, a legend. The rich know the power of him. - And with this? - (Raoul) The damsel is curious. You wanna know why he's so adored, that son of a bitch? In the past he has used his "power" of him... ..to help the weak. Farmers, desperate,... ... warriors, wealthy entrepreneurs. They took their loved ones to Caleb and asked him to heal them from the diseases that had afflicted them. Plague, rubella, leprosy,... ..scarlet fever, tuberculosis and so on. Apparently they seemed to heal,... ... actually it was hell waiting for them. Those poor souls have been damned for eternity. What the fuck? Now it all makes sense. But why my sister? Why so many souls? (Gabriel) What do vampires eat? Of blood. Blood is life for them. You know this. How do they feed without arousing suspicion in strangers? With the help of the inhabitants and their admirers. Not to mention the wine. Their blood, the blood of Caleb and his followers, is in the wine. And on reflection, we too are potential damned souls. If one of them bites our neck and decides not to drink all of our blood,... ..then we too would be destined to die and then awaken as beasts of Satan. (Gabriel) Take it. You will need them. And Martha? What will become of her? (Adam) "Gone". Like my cigar. I'm sorry. (Raoul) I have been waiting for this moment for twelve years. And thanks to you, my revenge will fall on that fucking bloodsucker! - (Rebecca) Thanks to us? - Caleb will come looking for you. You have discovered this and have been chosen as his next victims. Being with you is the last chance to take that vampire and send him to hell,... ..without losing the innocent yet. Why wait so long? Why not stop it first? If you had decided years ago, my Marta, her sister and many innocent people would still be alive! (Mei Chang) You inspired us. We observed him, we tried to get close to him several times,... ..but to no avail. Your courage prompted Gabriele to call us... ..and to face once and for all a curse that has been going on for centuries. No one has come as close to him as you have. (softly) he Then he doesn't speak only in Chinese. (Rebecca) And why are you still alive? Because they don't live here. Caleb has no power outside of Timere. Whoever enters his territory is his prey,... ..but if the vampire crosses the line, then he is a beast to be eradicated. This is why Timere is no longer on the maps. Agreements made with the state a long time ago. So would it be enough to leave to be safe? Once inside Timere, it is no longer possible to leave. Now the country is on high alert and they won't rest until they find you. - How many vampires are there in town? - We don't know that yet. And they are not only our enemies, unfortunately. Of course knowing the exact number of how many vampires roam the walls of Timere,... ..would have been helpful. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Maybe I know how to help you. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) (SUSPENSE MUSIC) If they don't arrive in fifteen minutes, I'll go get them. (SUSPENSE MUSIC) And this? (SUSPENSE MUSIC) Oh my God...
