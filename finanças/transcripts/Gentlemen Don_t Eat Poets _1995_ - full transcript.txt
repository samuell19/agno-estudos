[ Groaning ] Ohhh. I suppose Hugo will want these for Herbert. ♪♪ [ Humming ] ♪ Sidney. What a naughty boy. Hello, Matilda. [ Panting, moaning ] [ Dogs barking, howling ] [ Sighs ] Damn it. I just don't get it. Bugger off ! [ Woman ] Hugo, did you hear ? hmm ? Mr. and Mrs. Fledge, remember ? they're starting today. Hmm. and they're cheap. Mr. Fledge ? funny name. Got references, have they ? What does he say about references ? No, they don't. His last employer was a farmer in Kenya. He died very suddenly. Trampled by an ox, he says. A mad ox ? Do as you please, Harriet. It's of no concern to me. I've got to concentrate on my lecture. Trampled by an ox ? Must mean a buffalo. Remember that planter chap in Kigali, eh ? The one you had a crush on. He was gored by a buffalo. Lost his testicles, if I remember rightly. Poor Ronald. [ Hugo ] Ronald. Ah, yes, that was Africa between the wars. Attractive fellow. I always find the kitchen is the heart of the house. Don't you, Mrs. Fledge ? [ Hugo continues ] I don't think Harriet ever actually did anything with him, though god knows she had ample opportunity. Nor would I have blamed her. I was away a lot, first in Zanzibar, then the danakil depression, where I found the bones of my greatest discovery, the phlegmosaurus. But this new Butler was an altogether different animal. If only I'd realized then what devilish schemes this cuckoo was up to, the door would never have been opened to Mr. and Mrs. Fledge. [ Harriet ] And this is your domain, fledge. All of the tins of Polish and so forth... You can find in this cupboard here. You must tell me if there's anything else you need. I will, your ladyship. And along this passage is the wine cellar. [ Hugo ] George lecky's family had been part of crook... Since the hundred years war. Legend has it that my ancestor bought his ancestor in a brothel in Bratislava.He'd been with me on every expedition. Buryatskaya, Mongolia, champagne and of course the danakil. We shared as much as men can share. [ Birds squawking ] George. [ Clears throat ] Can Sidney have the parrot room ? I suppose so. You must get Mrs. Fledge to do it out, though. No one's slept there since before the war. [ Door opens ] [ Harriet ] There you are, darling. How about a Sherry ? Good morning, sir Hugo. You must be fledge. I will take a glass of Sherry, fledge. How are the bones, daddy ? The bones ! The bones are giving me some difficulty this morning. Either one of these creatures has a huge extra claw... Or I put the thing together all wrong ! There again, I may have discovered an entire new species. The whole thing's a bloody Jigsaw puzzle. What a pity they're extinct. Mmm. [ Birds squawking ] No, no, I'm afraid that won't do at all, fledge. I asked for a glass of Sherry, not a thimble. [ Chuckling ] Fledge. Would you bring Herbert to the table ? [ Harriet ] No, Hugo, please. Didn't you tell fledge about Herbert ? Come, fledge. Meet Herbert. This is Herbert. Pick him up, man. Don't be feeble. [ Croaking ] Well done, fledge. Very good indeed. The toad: Symbol of lust in the Christian church, fledge. This is where we keep his lunch. Bring him to the table. Harriet, did you know that toads are poisonous ? The mubuti pygmies use the poison to kill gorillas. Fledge, I will take my coffee in the drawing room, please. Away from you and your stinking toad ! Why did I ever leave New York ? Your mother's in one of her moods today. Actually, it's only a defensive slime, the poison. Here. Highly unpleasant to predators, of course. One leak is usually fatal. You don't have to do it, you know. Your ladyship ? Humor him. You don't have to humor him. You don't have to pick up that disgusting creature. You must come to me if he tries to make you do things you don't want to. I'm sure that won't be a problem. Yes. I daresay you can look after yourself. Do you think he'll do ? Mummy certainly likes him. Mmm. I don't trust him. I think he's cunning, like a fox. A fox. Oh, yes. I like that. I like a fox. I like a fox too. But I don't know if I want one living in our house. [ Chuckling ] Darling, this young man, Sidney. What exactly are his intentions toward you ? Intentions ? Haven't a clue. Have to ask him. Hmmm. [ Laughing ] What on earth ? Ooh ! How horrid ! [ Bird squawking ] Good morning, Mrs. Fledge. Good morning, sir Hugo. Carry on with your work. I just wanted to know what dainties... You plan to tempt US with at luncheon today. Pike, sir Hugo. Splendid ! George nailed the big bastard. Good. I love a pike. Grilled ? Yes, sir Hugo. With onions, Mrs. Fledge ? Yes, sir Hugo. And carrots, Mrs. Fledge ? Yes, sir Hugo. Good. Because Cleo's young man is arriving this morning, and we want to create a good impression, don't we, Mrs. Fledge ? Yes, sir Hugo. Good. [ Sniffing ] The affairs of the house were a welcome diversion from my one true passion. Supreme amongst the tons of bones I'd brought back from my excavations... Was phlegmosaurus, a magnificent raptor, who was now almost complete. I spent most of my days in the barn, and many a night. The conjugal bed, having produced my darling Cleo, had long since been covered in cobwebs. And, in truth, no woman could beguile me in the way... That phlegmosaurus had spun his web of mystery. But now, at last, after ten years of frustration, I had penetrated his ancient secrets... And had been rewarded with a revelation that would rewrite dinosaur evolution. The royal society were about to witness... A momentous event. Well, I think that's it, gentlemen. The progression is clear. The first committed reptiles were succeeded by dinosaurs. But... these dinosaurs had bodies... Like birds. First, we had the primitive birds with teeth, followed by the advanced birds with teeth, and now we have the modern, toothless bird. [ Bird squawking ] Look at him, gentlemen ! Phlegmosaurus carbonensis. Imagine him on some mesozoic swamp, running down his prey. Imagine him reaching high enough speeds to become airborne. Then, through natural selection, his wrists began to flex, his metatarsals elongated, and he sprouted... Feathers ! Feathers, gentlemen. He sprouted feathers ! And he took to the air ! This is no cold-blooded, slow-moving, pea-brained lizard. This, gentlemen, is the father... Of the birds. [ Laughing ] And was your bath hot enough, Sidney ? The plumbing can be a little erratic. Oh, yes, lady coal. It was as hot as I could bear it. And I sat there so long, I came out wrinkled like a prune and pink as a lobster. I don't think you look like a lobster. You don't ? No. I think you look like a ferret. A ferret. Mmm-hmm. [ Laughing ] Oh, no, darling. Sidney doesn't look like a ferret at all. I think Sidney looks more like... an... an otter. An otter. Yes, that's it. An otter. Such graceful creatures. Who's an otter ? Daddy, this is Sidney. Sidney, meet daddy. How do you do, sir Hugo ? Fit and well. Thanks very much. So, you're Sidney. You're not really an otter, are you ? More an agouti. What's an agouti, daddy ? A very large rodent. With yellow teeth. Dinner is served. So, Sidney. What do you do ? I told you, daddy. Sidney's a poet. A poet ! [ Harriet ] Yes, dear. Sidney had been telling US about Rupert Brooke. Hadn't you, Sidney ? What's the point of it, though ? It doesn't further human knowledge, as far as I can see. Don't learn anything from it, do you ? Well, what do you think of that ? Well, I'm rather fond of Rupert Brooke, myself. Came to a bad end, I understand. Infected by a mosquito. Dead within days. Infected the brain. Swelled up like a pumpkin. How horrid ! Yes, and very painful, apparently. Must we talk about this ? There's a woman for you, Sidney. No spirit of scientific inquiry. Disease, infection, rot, filth. Feces ! Maggots ! All part of life's rich weft and woof, eh ? I give you a toast. Mosquitoes everywhere. Mosquitoes everywhere. [ Thundering ] What's the matter ? We must stop. Someone may come in. Your father would probably kill me if he saw US now. Don't worry about daddy. His bark is much worse than his bite. He'll come round, don't worry. I'm not so sure. You do love me ? Of course I do. Morning, harbottle. Good morning, sir Hugo. Brisk out today. Yes, yes, yes. Damn brisk. - The usual, please, harbottle. - Very good. Seen George yet ? - Here he comes now. - Oh. [ Grunting ] Morning. Ah, good morning, yes. Yes, a pint of the best, please, and a... Ginger beer. Pigs all right, are they, George ? I had to put the big sow back in her crate. She ate the runt. Ate the runt, did she ? Had a bit of runt trouble myself, up at the house. Cleo's young man. A poet, would you believe ? No bloody use to Cleo at all. I don't know what she sees in him. She's talking of skipping Oxford now. How's that old dinosaur coming, sir Hugo ? Interesting thing, John. He's got the foot of a bird, which tells me that he's not a reptile. And it also tells me that he can run, fast. Like an ostrich. And he's fierce too, by god. Teeth like razors. Big jaws. Eats well, then, does he ? He could have your runt for breakfast. Like a sausage, eh ? Meat. He eats meat, John. He hunts the brontosaurs, the big vegetarians... That shuffle about in herds. [ Snorting ] One smell of him and they panic. He-he-- he's lurking in the trees. Now crossing the swamp. He picks out the slowest. A young calf, maybe. Then...er, in for the kill ! He rips it open with this, his killing claw. Hey, steady on. And he devours it in front of his eyes, while he's still alive. Oh. Thank you. Another round, please, harbottle. I thought old Tom was done for then. I got carried away. Good job, your watching out for me, George. Well, someone has to. That's not the first time. Remember Zanzibar ? Yes. You certainly saved my back end that day. [ Sighing ] Cheers, George. Cheers, puss. Oh, you're a good man, George. I don't know what I'd do without you. Oh, that's enough of that. Go on. You'd best be getting off home. Home. My home's a barn, George. With a heap of bones for company. My daughter's in love with a poet. Going to start feeling sorry for yourself, are you ? Don't you take that tone with me. Oh, excuse me. Forgetting my place again, was I ? You're the only one who stands up to me, George. By god, I love you for it. You crusty old bastard. ♪♪ [ Slow dance band music ] ♪ [ Knocking ] Come in. Your tray, your ladyship. [ Sighing ] Thank you, fledge. Oh, fledge, this... Business between Hugo and Sidney, I... [ Sighing ] No, fledge. This is wrong. [ Gasping ] So wrong. Fledge-- [ Hugo ] Crook house. Ah, what memories her crumbling walls hold. Treachery, lechery, debauchery... Have all played their parts in her long history. So what if Harriet was having the Butler ? it was no more than I expected. I was hardly serving her in that way. Nil desperandum, nothing to despair. For eight centuries it has been the family motto, and with good reason. [ Knocking ] Come ! Oh, excuse me, sir Hugo. Come in, come in. Never seen a man in his underpants, Mrs. Fledge ? Just put them over the back of the chair, will you ? Mrs. Fledge, I wonder if you'd mind fastening my collar for me ? Mrs. Fledge. I wanted to ask you about your habits. Your pastimes. I beg your pardon, sir Hugo ? Your social life, that sort of thing. Do you like a bit of fun ? Not so's you'd notice, sir Hugo. Laughter does not come easily to you, Mrs. Fledge ? We've not had much to laugh about, fledge and I. Is that so ? A hard life, eh ? Hard enough, sir Hugo. Did you have difficulties in Kenya ? Of a sort. Will that be all ? I've still the potatoes to see to. What would amuse you, then, Mrs. Fledge ? I'm sure I can't say. Hugo, darling, the electrics have fused. We really must get this wiring seen to. No money. Anyway, I prefer candles. Go. Pick that up, will you ? Very good. Thank you. [ Harriet ] Darling. Ahem. Sidney has something to tell you. Don't you, Sidney ? One feels so silly. - You tell him, darling. - No, you. Come on, Sidney. Spit it out. - Yes, Sidney. Spit it out. - Come on, Sidney. Cleo and i-- I can't, lady coal. I simply can't. What Sidney is trying to tell you, dear, is-- that Cleo and I want to be married. You do ? [ Thundering ] Yes, sir Hugo. Not immediately, of course. Can't afford to, immediately. But we should like, um, that is, with your blessing, to, uh... Announce our engagement. Prospects ? I beg your pardon ? Prospects ! What are your prospects, Sidney ? Darling, I hardly think we need to go into that now. Well, I hope to bring out my first book of verse in the spring. Very lucrative, I'm sure. Stop being so awful. You're deliberately being difficult. Can we talk about this later ? By all means. Perhaps we'll all be a little less vague later. - Daddy ! - Don't you "oh, daddy" me, young woman. I'm serious. Ahem. Mrs. Fledge has made US something special. [ Applauding ] What a creation. Daddy, you have to cut the cake as well. Oh. Hmmph ! I do, do I ? Yes. Well, cake for you ! Cake for you ! And cake for you ! Marry my daughter, indeed. [ Thundering ] [ Hugo ] I realized then that under my roof I harbored... Not only a drunken housekeeper, a Butler as cunning as a fox, but also this spineless suitor for my beloved Cleo. What she saw in him, I don't know. A pretty boy, but nothing more. And for him she was going to abandon her studies... And bring this fop into the family ? A runt, no less ? Yes. Old phleg would have devoured him in a mouthful. And good riddance ! [ Thundering ] Damn ! Oh, bugger ! Awfully nice of you to do this, fledge. I'm just so hopeless at those sort of things. Gosh, I wish you were going to be our Butler. I don't know how we'll manage. Fledge-- mmm-hmm. Why do you think sir Hugo doesn't like me ? It's because I haven't got any money, isn't it ? It's just his manner. I get the feeling he'd like me to disappear out of his daughter's life altogether. Fledge ! Oh, lord ! What are you doing in here ? Mr. Sidney wanted some help with his lamp, sir Hugo. Yes, it's true, sir Hugo. I asked him to help. Shut up. I'm all yours now, sir Hugo. [ Thundering ] The dinosaur has always been considered a member of the class "reptilia." This, I believe, is an error. Perhaps the most serious scientific error... Of the last 200 years. The position is clear, gentlemen. These dinosaurs had bodies like birds. First, we had the primitive bird, with teeth, then we had the advanced bird, with teeth, and now we have the modern toothless bird... Phlegmosaurus carbonensis. This, gentlemen, is the father... Of the birds. Very interesting, sir Hugo. Most provocative. You're wasting your breath, Hugo. I don't know why you bother. You can't go around telling people that dinosaurs were birds. They've been reptiles since Darwin was a boy. That was when you were a lad. Before my time, I'm afraid. Seriously, old boy. You can't expect US to believe that creatures like this... Were capable of running down its prey. Good lord. It was a scavenger. It ate carrion. It slunk about waiting for something to die. Takes one to know one, what ? Oh, nonsense. A distant relative of the Turkey vulture, no doubt. Don't panic, cleghorn. Once you look at the thing soberly, you'll get the point. Very droll, Hugo. But you think about this: What happens to a misshelved book ? A misshelved book ? - What new nonsense is this ? - It ceases to exist. You shake up the order, you shake up the world. You're a dangerous man, Hugo. You're a radical. [ Laughing ] [ Squawking ] Pheasant, woodcock, teal duck, pigeon, your ladyship. I had no idea we'd killed so many. Only for a moment. I'll faint. [ Sir Hugo ] Ah, yes. That's the spot. Harder, fledge. Put some muscle into it, man. That's better. Now, about young giblet, fledge. I would like you to take less interest in the boy. I was only doing what I was asked, sir Hugo. Well, that's as may be, but I don't want you encouraging him. I don't want him here. What's so funny about that ? Funny ? Come on, man. Out with it. What do you know ? I hardly think it's worth mentioning, sir. Never mind that. Tell me. I have the impression that Mr. Sidney might prefer gentlemen. Whiskey, fledge. A large one. In my room. Here I am, fledge. What did you want to see me about ? You've got a nerve. Really ? Why ? Because of what I saw. And what was that ? You and her ladyship. In the game room. [ Screaming ] Oh, excuse me, miss. No, wait, fledge. He didn't say anything to you, did he ? Mr. Sidney did not confide in me, miss. My bike is gone. All I can think is that he went into the village for something. Well, don't you have any ideas at all ? I'm afraid not, miss. You can't think of anything ? What's going on, fledge ? What's your game ? If you'll excuse me, miss, I have my duties. You're up to no good. I can smell it. I think you know something about Sidney. If he comes to any harm, you'll pay for it, Mr. Fledge ! I like it here. We'll stay, won't we ? Yes. We'll be staying. [ Bell ringing ] So you see, inspector, we have no idea why... He would take off like that, without a word. His mother has heard nothing from him. And no reason to suspect anything... untoward ? No, nothing. He'd just proposed to our daughter. Cold feet, perhaps. Do not fret, lady coal. I will start my investigations at once. Thank you. Oh, and inspector. Let's keep it discreet, hmm ? Of course, lady coal. [ Clearing throat ] Good day, madam. [ Bird squawking ] Sidney, where are you ? Fledge, see this ? It's Sidney's. Know where I found it ? I've no idea, miss. In your den. Mr. Sidney visited the Butler's pantry more than once, miss Cleo. Oh ? Why ? Well, on one occasion, he wished me to light his lamp. Oh, and he just so happened to drop his lighter, I suppose ? I suppose so, miss Cleo. And the other times ? Miss ? The other times he visited you in your den ? What did he want ? Company. Company ! He had quite enough company in me. As you say, miss Cleo. Ahem. Fledge. You gave me a start. What are you creeping about for, man ? Sir Hugo-- you haven't seen a metatarsal fragment ? Small ? Claw-like ? Claw-like ? No, I don't believe I have, sir Hugo. Mislaid it somewhere. Got to find it. Bloody essential. My life's work depends on the thing. Everything hinges on the claw. Indeed, sir Hugo. Yes, that's how he cuts down his prey ! Ha, ha ! Like that ! Quite. Sir Hugo-- got to find the bloody thing. Sir Hugo-- yes, yes ? What is it ? There's an inspector limp. He's in the house. He wants to talk to you. Oh, bugger the man. [ Door opening ] Ah. Good morning, sir Hugo. Happy Christmas. What do you want, limp ? I've got better things to do than stand around exchanging compliments of the season. Well, I do apologize for interrupting you this morning, of all mornings, when you would wish to be in the bosom of your-- never mind your bosoms, limp ! What do you want ? The law never sleeps, sir Hugo. May I ask you to come down to the station with me... On a matter of routine identification ? [ Limp ] If you please. This bicycle was dug up on ceck marsh early this morning. The handlebars were found poking up through the earth. Sir Hugo, is this the bicycle that Sidney giblet was riding... On the day that he disappeared ? Yes, it is. George. George, you haven't come across old phleg's claw, have you ? I'm in a bloody panic about the thing. I can't find it anywhere. No. I'd remember. Where the devil have I left it ? They found Cleo's bike, you know. It was out on the marsh. Nasty business. You don't know the half of it. What do you mean ? What half of it don't I know ? We don't-- I mean-- we haven't heard the last of it, that's what I mean. If I'd known the trouble that boy was going to cause, I'd never have let him in the house. Big one, eh ? Yeah, her tits packed up. She'll only be good for pork pies now. Huh ! Telephone, sir Hugo. Who is it ? It's Mrs. Giblet. She's at the fox and pheasant. Oh, no ! Darling, why do you hate her so much ? Hello ? You've never met her, mummy. She's a monster. One moment. Well ? she's come to help the police look for Sidney. With her companion, a miss freebody. [ Bell ringing ] We shall go over every inch of that marsh, lavinia. Oh, that poor boy. How he must have suffered. How, in his last agonies, he must have craved the warmth of his mother's tender bosom. How-- that's enough of that. Now, who's this ? Mrs. Giblet ? I am she. My name is fledge. I'm the Butler at crook. Are you, indeed ? You'd better sit down, then. Leave US, freebody. I sense sir Hugo formed an intense antagonism toward my son... And wished to prevent him marrying Cleo. Devoutly wished it, Mrs. Giblet. Mr. Sidney mentioned it on more than one occasion. He could not understand how he had aroused such strong feelings in sir Hugo. Tell me, does sir Hugo strike you as being capable of violence ? I cannot say. My employer is a man of quick temper. He drinks heavily and is easily angered. He reacts poorly to frustration of any kind. You're a good man, fledge. And you respect the truth. Perhaps you'll be my eyes and ears in crook. I do apologize for the cold and the dark. The pipes burst and fused all the electrical appliances. So infuriating. Sit down, freebody. You're making everybody uncomfortable. - Oh ! [ Mrs. Giblet ] I met the man limp. Sir Hugo, I'm surprised you place any confidence in him at all. With all the progress he's making, we'll be lucky to see Sidney in a box. - Please ! - I'm sorry, my dear. But I've never allowed myself to be seduced... By the blandishments of illusion and false hope. I must say, lady babblehump. I was wondering if my wardrobe might not be... A trifle dressy outside London. But I see from your example I need not have worried. One cannot be overdressed in the country, Mrs. Giblet. Temperatures do not permit it ! [ Laughing ] [ Man ] Wonderful ham, Hugo. Your man lecky's ? Mmm. I must say, Fred, I'm finding it rather strong meat myself. Nonsense. George always gives US a good strong ham. It's all a matter of swill, he tells me. Rather too rich for me, sir Hugo. Really ? Best pork in the county. I should call it gamy. I should call it "swill power" ! [ Laughing ] [ Man ] Good one, Connie. [ Laughing continues ] Swill power. [ Laughing continues ] And, fledge, my compliments to Mrs. Fledge. A superb dinner. Hear, hear. Lady coal, an old woman thanks you for hospitality... Consistent with the best traditions of the American republic. [ Man ] Well said, madam. - Quite so. - American indeed. How can you ? How can you all sit here and stuff yourselves ? When Sidney's out there ? in pain ? Now, darling. Don't try and shut me up, mummy. You all sit here as if nothing had happened. When all the time, the most appalling things are happening. You have no conception of the evil that exists out there. You think the worst thing in the world is a burst pipe... Or a gamy ham. And you don't see it. You make yourselves blind to it. Because it's just too much trouble. But it's there, all right. It's there. And you'll find it, Mrs. Giblet. [ Moaning ] [ Screaming ] My poor girl. What is it ? Daddy. It's horrible. How ghastly. What, darling ? He came to see me. Who came to see you, darling ? Sidney did. Sidney ? But that's impossible. You mean Sidney's here, in this house ? No, he's not here. You won't see him. He's dead. Now, now, darling. We don't know that. It's just a bad dream. It's not a dream ! I always wake up. His throat is torn open. He has this horrible gash under his chin. Someone cut his throat. And he's trying to tell me something. What ? He's trying to say a name. I'm sure. It's fledge. Oh. My god. A bone ! [ Fledge ] Bad news, sir Hugo. Well, tell me, man. It appears that Mrs. Giblet has been successful. Successful ? Young Mr. Sidney's body has been found. Oh, my god. His condition is, apparently, remarkable. Well, go on, go on, go on. He's been reduced to bones. Butchered and gnawed. Butchered and what, fledge ? - Butchered by men. - Yes ? And gnawed by pigs. How do they know that ? Well, according to the police, many a murdered body ends up being fed to pigs. They'll eat anything, you see. So their forensic men are well acquainted with pig's teeth. And yours are the only pigs in the district, sir Hugo. Good god, man. Who the devil do you think you are, to talk to me like this ? Whoever fed young giblet to the pigs must have buried his bones in the marsh. And suspicion will undoubtedly fall on this house. I may as well tell you this now, fledge. I want you to pack your bags and get out ! Then there's the bone. The missing bone. The one you've been looking for, sir Hugo. You have it ! It too was found in remarkable condition. Thick with dried blood. It would, of course, be covered in your fingerprints. It's in a safe place. Not to worry, sir Hugo. George lecky ? No. You are-- ? John lecky. Afternoon, Hubert. Little John. Where is George lecky ? Right. Well, we're going to search this farm. We have a warrant. In you go. Stop ! I order you to stop ! Stop ! I order you to stop ! Stop ! Stop ! in the name of the police ! stop the lorry ! Into the cars ! Get after him ! He can't get far ! [ Police bells ringing ] Let him run. I want 50 men out here in the morning. [ Coughing ] [ Coughing ] Good god, man. Come down ! Talk to me, George ! Tell me what happened ! It was our little fool, John. It was all of his making. Go on. He was out on the marsh one night, looking for rabbit. He spotted someone digging a hole. So little Johnny hides in the old mill, but he slips. And the fella, he takes off in a fright. Could he tell who was digging the hole ? No. It was too far away. Anyway, little John's curious. So he goes to look in the sack that's being buried. Before the fella can come back and finish the job, he drags it off back to the farm. Good god, man. What on earth did he think he was doing ? That you, John ? [ Sighing ] Why didn't you tell me any of this before ? Why did you run away ? I panicked. I didn't want to get John into trouble. He's a bit simple, but he's not wicked. So what happens next ? I just had to finish the job, that's all there was to it. It was John that buried the bones after the pigs had done. He didn't make much of a job of it. I should have done it myself. Oh, Christ. [ Sighing ] Christ. What's going to happen to me now ? You must give yourself up. If I give myself up, I'll get done for murder. You know that. Yes. But you didn't murder him. But who did ? Fledge. Oh, fledge. You've brought me back to life. [ Birds squawking, flapping wings ] [ Squawking ] [ Speaking in malay ] George. George. If it was fledge that killed young giblet, why don't you tell the police ? No evidence. "How did he do it ?" they'll ask me. "Why did he do it ?" I'll have to tell them I don't know. It was you that hated that boy. Not fledge. Now, now, George. Let's stay calm. We'll get you out of this mess. You should never have run. Remember what you said to me in Zanzibar ? Yeah, but we aren't in Zanzibar. Things have changed. Boys were two a penny in those days. Ah, good morning. We have reason to believe George lecky is hiding on the property, sir Hugo. We have a warrant, but I'm sure it will not be necessary. Will it ? You're making a big mistake, limp. He's innocent. You'll be hearing from my solicitor ! Sir Edward Tome ! [ Men's voices, shouting ] They've got him. [ Cursing in malay ] [ Shouting in malay continues ] My god. He thinks it was me who called the police. [ Grunting ] You bastards ! Ah, Mrs. Fledge. I'm going to have to ask a favor of you. Mrs. Giblet is coming down to see me and... well, fledge isn't here. I was wondering if you could stand in for him. Don't see why not. Right. [ Sighing ] Cleo-- I do wish you wouldn't drink in the morning, Mrs. Fledge. It's so bad for you. Rumpty tumpty, eh, your ladyship ? Mrs. Giblet. Disturbing news, lady coal. George lecky has denied that he murdered my son. Of course George didn't kill Sidney. He simply doesn't have that sort of violence in him. I agree. But this business has aroused strong emotion in the popular breast. He will not be believed. He must tell the truth. Surely that's enough. This is england, after all. [ Laughing ] Dear lady coal, your faith is touching. But you see, it will be assumed that a man who would stumble upon a dead body... And feed it to his pigs is a man who could kill. We tend to lose the fine distinctions when it comes to such things. Did George say who killed him ? According to limp, yes, he does. And that is what I came to crook to talk to you about. Like you, I don't believe George lecky killed my son. But if he swings-- Mrs. Giblet, please. If he is found guilty, then Sidney's murderer will go free. Let me ask you frankly: Who do you think killed my son ? Mrs. Giblet, if I knew-- has it ever occurred to you, lady coal, that your husband was in any way involved ? Hugo ? Rubbish ! Rubbish, you foul old hag. You come sneaking in here like a smug little stoat... And accuse my father. How dare you ! what gives you the right ? Get out of my house, do you hear ? Get out with your foul lies ! My dear girl, this is what George lecky has told the police. You sat on Sidney all his life. It's a wonder there was anything left of him at all after growing up with you. Sidney was a weak boy. He needed a firm hand. A firm hand ! You call what you did to him "a firm hand" ? Perhaps a firm hand would have done you some good, young lady. Oh, you bloody old witch ! Cleo ! You apologize, Cleo ! Ap-- you're hurting me, mother. Cleo, apologize. I'm sorry, Mrs. Giblet. Freebody, we're leaving. Good day. Good day. That was dreadful. That was outrageous. I-I've never been so embarrassed in all my life. Whatever came over you, Cleo ? Daddy didn't kill Sidney. I know who killed Sidney. Darling, you-- it was fledge ! What the hell are you doing ? [ Bell ringing ] The bloody impertinence of the man. Treating me as if I were a common criminal. I shall have a word with the chief constable. What the devil do you think you're playing at, fledge ? Now, darling. I gave him my permission to do this. In fact, I suggested it. Are you out of your mind ? Fledge, go and change at once ! You stay where you are. Hugo, this is the 20th century. And I think the idea of uniformed servants is no longer appropriate. It may not be appropriate for you, but I'm damned if i'm going to be waited on... By a Butler pretending to be a gentleman. Fledge, would you wait outside while we, uh, discuss this ? It's quite simple, Hugo. I pay the servants, just like I pay all the bills. So I decide what they wear. I won't stand for it, Harriet. I warn you. What do you intend to do about it ? ♪♪ [ Distant swing music ] [ Harriet laughing ] You're a very bad Butler, aren't you ? [ Laughing continues ] [ Grunting, laughing ] [ Grunting, shouting ] Members of the jury, the prosecution will attempt to persuade you that George lecky... Is a cold-blooded killer. But he is no monster. He is a simple, decent man of the soil. A man who served his country with honor. But a man who, yes, did make a foolish blunder... By failing to report the finding... Of Sidney giblet's body. But a foolish blunder, members of the jury, is by no means the same thing as willful murder. Mr. Lecky, having fed the remains... Of Sidney giblet to your pigs, what happened to them ? When they were fat, we slaughtered them. And then ? and then we butchered them. When you say "we" ? Little John and me. Little John ? My brother. John lecky. I see. And did John lecky know... About your feeding Sidney giblet's body to the pigs ? No. So, having slaughtered and butchered... The pigs that ate Sidney giblet, what did you do with the meat, Mr. Lecky ? We sent it over to the house. Like we've always done. To sir Hugo. He takes all our meat. [ Voices muttering, indistinct ] [ Judge ] Order ! Order ! Mrs. Fledge ? We ate Sidney. [ Man ] Wonderful ham, Hugo. Your man lecky's ? [ Woman laughing ] A nice pork chop today, sir Hugo. Get out. Get out of my sight, fledge. That's all. The young man from the village came this morning. He wished to know if you required a new pig man. So I hired him. You... what ? I hired him. Your man lecky's hardly coming back now, is he ? How dare you ? You-- [ grunting ] [ Grunting ] Pretending to be a gentleman, am I ? Daddy ! Daddy ? Aaah ! [ Screaming ] Straightforward aneurism, gentlemen, with massive damage to the physical and intellectual faculties. He can still chew, and swallow, like a cow, but that's all. He lacks... mental presence. He is, ontologically speaking, dead. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. This man is a vegetable. Right. Next. Come along, sir Hugo. [ Sir Hugo's inner voice ] Then, surely, it is my fate to be a grotesque. For, a man who turns into a vegetable, isn't that a grotesque ? I'm surprised at Harriet's reaction. I did not believe she felt anything for me. But there is a modicum of compassion... Overwhelmed with a greater feeling of indifference. But she has more exciting passions in her life now. It's Cleo I'm worried about. She's now so vulnerable. I blame myself, of course. I should have realized the moment he came into the house... That we were harboring a lethal parasite. What's an aneurism ? It's a blood clot on the brain. He's had a stroke. But I'm sure I've read people can recover from it. Oh, really ? We can take him home, can't we ? He'll be much happier there. Cleo, professor dendrite said that he was a cabbage. Cabbages have no feelings. Well, I'm not so sure. [ Birds squawking ] Do you think he's warm enough ? Dad, are you warm enough ? [ Sighing ] Darling, must you do this ? He understands nothing. Remember what dendrite said ? He can't hear. I know what he's thinking. I can tell by his eyes. Fledge. [ Man ] Do you find the defendant George kitchener lecky... Guilty or not guilty of willful murder ? - Guilty. - [ Murmuring voices, indistinct ] I'm not bloody guilty, I tell you. You hang me, you hang the wrong man. Look, this isn't justice, it's a cock-up ! Can't you see that ? It's a cock-up, Christ almighty ! He's done for, sir Hugo. We've lost him. [ Groaning ] [ Heavy door opening ] You're my only hope now. You've got to save me. It was little John found the body. Little John. He saw who it was digging the hole in the marsh that night. It was sir Hugo. Mr. Lecky ! Mr. Lecky ? Mr. Lecky ! This little piggy went to market. This little piggy stayed at home. This little piggy had the roast beef. This poor little piggy had none. But this little piggy... Went squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak... I can't find my way home. They're like a pair of old cheddars, sir Hugo. They want him, do they ? She's back. Be all right, won't it ? Nothing to worry about. John, would you tell lady Cole what you told me... About that night on the marsh ? Well, I was out on the marsh... Lookin' at me snares. But then I see someone digging a hole. So I creep up on him. But my foot slips and he hears me, and he's off. So I have a look in his bag, and it's a dead body. Oh, good heavens. It's not a local man, your ladyship, don't you worry. So I says to myself... He'll do nicely for the pigs. That was my son you found in the sack, John. But never mind that for now. What we want to know is: Who was out there digging that hole ? It were a dark night, Mrs. giblet. It's hard to say. Could it have been sir Hugo ? He had the use of his legs back then. It might have been. No, John. Not Hugo. Fledge. Look at him. He killed Sidney. It was him. Well, John ? Was it me ? I-I-It might have been. Oh, you donkey. I believe you murdered my son. You took his body out of the marsh with the intention of disposing of it. - Daddy says, "bugger off !" - You were interrupted in the course of your work. Daddy says he didn't do it, so bugger off back to London and take your stick insect ! [ Sighing ] What I don't understand, Mrs. Giblet, is why. Why Hugo would want to kill Sidney. Because it's in his nature. He's a predatory creature, just like his damned dinosaur. No, Mrs. Giblet. I'm afraid that won't do. That it won't do at all. You're going to have to do a great deal better than that. [ Laughing ] [ Laughter continues ] [ Sir Hugo's inner voice ] Look at him, the monster. Look at him. Watching me. What does he see ? He sees, I think, himself. He sees me as a mirror of his inner self. And it fascinates him to look... At this twisted and misshapen model of his own soul. He is the usurper, the murderer, the serpent in our Eden. So it's not I, after all, who am the grotesque. But fledge. [ Grunting ] Daddy. [ Grunting ] Don't you worry, daddy. I'll fix him. [ Grunting ] [ Sir Hugo ] George was hanged just before easter. He found peace, I hope. God knows, he'd had little enough since the day he was arrested in my barn. Poor fellow. Fledge. One-tenth of a gram will kill a coyote. So times that by ten for man, and double it for good measure. Death should occur within a few minutes.
