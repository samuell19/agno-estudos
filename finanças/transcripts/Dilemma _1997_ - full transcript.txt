I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DRIVE DOWN TO PUNTA DIABLO? PUNTA DIABLO? YOU MEAN MEXICO? I FLEW THOSE GUYS TO DEVIL'S POINT. IT'S IN NEVADA. THAT'S WHERE I TOOK THEM.

HE GOT THAT FROM A RETIRED REALTOR WHO SOLD IT TO HIM RIGHT AFTER THE KOREAN WAR. THIS IS RUDY SALAZAR. HMM. THIS IS THE FELLA YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR, HUH? YES. YEAH, BUT, SHERIFF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU BRING THIS GUY IN ALIVE. KIND OF TAKES THE FUN OUT OF IT, I KNOW, BUT WE'LL DO OUR BEST, RIGHT, SHERIFF? ( laughs ) SO WHEN WE CAN GO AND SEE THIS PLACE? WELL, NOT FOR A LITTLE BIT. MY DEPUTIES HAD TO GO PICK SOME, UH, CITY HIKER THAT GOT STRANDED UP IN MONROE FLATS. BUT THEY'LL BE ALONG PRESENTLY. WELL, I KNOW IT AIN'T FANCY, MA'AM. GARCIA'S BOTH MANAGER AND COOK. HEY, THIS, UH-- THIS SALAZAR'S A PRETTY TOUGH NUMBER. HOW MANY DEPUTIES DO YOU HAVE? TWO. TWO? YOU WANT A ROOM... FOR TWO? YEAH, A ROOM FOR TWO WOULD BE FINE. THANKS. I AIN'T NEVER ATE IN HERE MYSELF, MISS CANTRELL, SO I CANNOT RECOMMEND THE FOOD. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, SHERIFF. I'M REALLY NOT THAT HUNGRY, ANYWAY. YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SEPARATE ROOMS? THANKS A LOT, SHERIFF. MA'AM. YOU EVER EAT IN THAT PLACE? SOMETIMES. BUT STAY AWAY FROM GARCIA'S CHILI BEANS. ONE BOWL OF THAT... EQUALS ABOUT FIVE TRIPS TO THE TOILET. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT SAFETY TIP. HE'S CUTE, HUH? UH-HUH. ALL RIGHT. THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. SO IT'S REALLY CHARMING, ISN'T IT? HEY, DO YOU MIND IF I ACTUALLY TAKE A SHOWER? 'CAUSE I'M A LITTLE WET. HELP YOURSELF. YEAH. RIGHT. ( grunting ) ( thud ) YEAH. CALL ME AS SOON AS THEY LEAVE. CAPTAIN DENT, PLEASE. CAPTAIN DENT? IT'S QUIN. NO, WE JUST-- WE JUST GOT HERE. EVERYTHING'S FINE, OTHER THAN THE FACT THEY GOT TWO DEPUTIES. ONLY TWO DEPUTIES? OH, JESUS CHRIST. WHAT A NIGHTMARE. ( laughs ) LOOK, UM... YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT FOR REINFORCEMENTS, ALL RIGHT? NO, WE'RE GONNA BE FINE. NO, SIR, THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA. I WANT TO HIT HIM BEFORE HE KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING. OKAY, WELL, LOOK...

I, UM-- I-- ( laughs ) I JUST WANTED-- I DON'T-- ( laughs ) I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY ABOUT THIS. I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. WELL, I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, BUT ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME WITH DELFINA'S LIFE. I REALLY COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT YOU. THANK YOU. HEY. ( telephone ringing ) ONE SECOND. HELLO? UH... ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. TEN MINUTES. UM... YOU'D BETTER GET DRESSED. OKAY. WOW. MA'AM, THE DEPUTIES-- HANK AND MITCH. HOW YOU DOING, GENTLEMEN? YEAH, THEY JUST LEFT. FOUR OF THEM, PLUS THE GIRL. YEAH. OKAY. Sheriff: SO GOOD, YOUNG MAN. SO FAR NOW, WHY DON'T YOU JUST MOSEY ON OVER HERE AND LEAN UP AGAINST THIS PATROL CAR? SPREAD 'EM. HELLO? HELLO, MY LITTLE ANGEL? HOW ARE YOU DOING? NOT SO GOOD. HERE, THE DOCTOR WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. ALL RIGHT, THEN, PUT HIM ON. HELLO. DR. BARLOW. DR. BARLOW. YES, HOW'S SHE DOING? SHE'S NOT DOING VERY WELL AT ALL. WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN, BUT-- RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. JUST ONE MORE THING. IF YOU NEVER HEARD OF RUDY SALAZAR, WHO GAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THIS PLACE? HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW CARLOS LOPEZ. I DIDN'T SOME CONSTRUCTION WORK FOR HIM. MOST OF THE TIME, WE COME UP HERE TOGETHER, BUT HE GOT HURT LAST WEEK. YEAH, I KNOW ABOUT THAT. LOPEZ HAS GOT A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY IN RENO. FELL OFF A LADDER, MESSED UP HIS BACK. SATISFIED? NOT YET. DID YOU RUN A CHECK ON CARLOS LOPEZ? YEAH, I FOUND OUT HE'S REFURBISHING A MANSION OVER IN HEELUM FLATS, BUT HE AIN'T SEEN RUDY SINCE HE GOT SENT AWAY. REFURBISHING? I THOUGHT THEY WERE INTO CONSTRUCTION. NOT ANYMORE. MAKE MORE MONEY JUST GUTTING THE INSIDES THAN REMODELING. HEY, I TOLD YOU IT WOULD WORK. THAT COP QUIN IS DUMBER THAN SHIT. I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH ALL THAT DYNAMITE BACK THERE IF THEY'RE NOT INTO CONSTRUCTION. WHAT DYNAMITE? KRASCO HAD SOME DYNAMITE IN THE HOUSE. HMM. YOU GOT THAT PHOTO ON YOU? MM-HMM. WHERE'S THE WISHING WELL? OLD MAN SALAZAR'S MADE HIM BUILD IT OVER THE SHELTER. WHAT SHELTER'S THAT? JESSE BUILT HIMSELF AN AIR-RAID SHELTER BACK DURING THE ATOMIC BOMB SCARE IN THE EARLY '50s. MRS. SALAZAR HATED THE DAMN THING... CALLED IT AN EYESORE. WHAT'D THEY DO, COVER IT UP? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A HELL OF A PLACE FOR A HIDEOUT. WE GOT COMPANY. BY THE WAY, SHERIFF-- WE KNOW, WE KNOW, MISS CANTRELL. SALAZAR HAS TO BE TAKEN ALIVE. JUST MAKING SURE. UHH! COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. OH, BOY. ( grunting ) COME ON, PRETTY BOY. ( gun clicking ) ( both grunting ) ( beeping ) ( beeping ) HOW IS SHE? I THINK SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY. HA HA! SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY! OH, YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( chuckles ) THANK YOU. HEY, HEY. HOW'S SHE DOING? SHE'S GONNA BE FINE. DOC... WHAT'S UP WITH SALAZAR? HOW'S HE DOING? SALAZAR, ON THE OTHER HAND, ISN'T DOING VERY WELL. HE'S, UH, IN A LOT OF PAIN. GOOD! GOOD! ( both laughing ) ♪♪
