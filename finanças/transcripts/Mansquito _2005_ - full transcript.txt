Hospitals across the country are facing what doctors call a potential tragedy the likes of which our generation has never seen. This virus will make West Nile seem like the common cold. The disease affects both young and old. Those most at risk of the new virus are demanding treatments, while officials are saying the hospitals have no room. Every bed is full and they are doing all they can. At its worst, West Nile Virus was responsible for a few hundred deaths per summer. But the Guilin virus stands to kill more than 1,000 times that number. We have created a mosquito incapable of carrying this deadly virus. Once released back into the environment, it will quickly out-breed the infectious mosquitoes, and, God willing, eliminate this virus once and for all. [siren wailing] [siren wailing continues] [man narrating] Case Number 750K. It was the summer that the Guilin Virus had really taken hold. Thousands were infected. [policeman] We have no details for you at this time. [narrator] I was running the homicide desk. Ray Erickson, a convicted murderer I'd put away years ago, was being transferred to a private research facility. I never could've imagined that such a routine transfer would bring my entire life crashing down around me. [buzzing sound] [buzzing] God damn mosquitoes! Is it ready? Come on, Aaron, give me a break. Aaron, I have told you a million times, the initial results were positive, yes. But we need to do more testing to be absolutely certain. The new breed of the mosquitoes have shown no trace of the virus. You said so yourself. Yes, I did. Jennifer, don't you realize what we have here? We're sitting on a gold mine! Don't you read the newspapers? It's everywhere! Hell, you could be up for a Nobel Prize. We are working around the clock to make certain that all our results are positive. Do you not think we wanna find a cure to this virus? Come on, Jennifer, results are very positive. They're not ready, Aaron. We haven't even tested them on humans yet. You're right. We haven't even tested them on humans... yet. How long until you release them? If it were up to Dr. Michaels, we would've released them a week ago. He's pretty anxious, huh? He's more anxious about the investors than he is about the virus. Sir, we just got a call from the prison transport. Traffic's tied them up, but they'll be here soon. Damn it, I wanted to get started on him tonight. Tell them to hurry up, and please use the back entrance. We don't need the public seeing a prison bus out there on our front drive. Yes, sir. Right away. That's the suspension gel? [Jennifer] Mm-hmm. Just pour it in there gently. Go ahead. That's it. Excellent. We need an even dispersal. We don't want these little guys moving around. [Jennifer] Gently does it. Perfect. Don't worry. It doesn't hurt them. Let's put it in the chamber. [mechanism clanking] The combination of the gel and the radiation from the reactor will cause their DNA to mutate. This is just one of the series of tests we're conducting using radiation. We use the larva as a control group to verify our results to see if the irradiation has done its job. We use the computer to run the program because the levels have to be exact. Too little, and nothing happens. Too much, and who knows what you'd get. Hey, Ray, you having a good time, buddy? [laughing] Don't forget to take it around back. Okay, that does it for now. Why don't we go grab some coffee? [groans] Are you hungry at all? Nah, just a coffee for me. All clear. Go ahead. [alarm bell ringing] All right, let me get him outta here. Let's go. Step out. Ray Erickson. We're supposed to take him downstairs. I'll tell him you're here. The prisoner's here. Right. Sign here. And initialize there. You gotta sign here too. Where? Down there. Okay? Thank you. Follow me. The paperwork stays here. The others should be ready to come out by now. I forgot to grab some sugar. I'll be right back. Thanks. Okay, Ray, let's go. [guard] He's making a break! [gunshots firing] [guard shouting] He's moving! He's moving! We got a problem up here! [screams] Get off me! [guard] Up here! Put the gun down now! Open the door or she dies! [Ray] Hurry! Move it! [key card beeping] Hurry! Run! Shoot! Try it! Move it! Move it now! [key card beeping continuing] [screaming] Back off! [Ray] You, back off or I'll kill 'em both! That's it! [gunshot] [gasps] Oh, no! Don't hurt Liz, please! [screams] There's nowhere to go! Put the gun down now! You killed her! I said, shut up! [Ray screaming] [gunshots] [alarm blaring] [P.A. system] All personnel must evacuate. All personnel must evacuate immediately. [shouting] [screams] [explosion rumbling] [alarm blaring continues] [groaning] [alarm blaring stops] [voice over loudspeakers] Radiation levels returning to normal. Radiation levels returning to normal. [crying] [guard] Secure the area! Are you okay? Let's get you some help. We need some backup. Look at this! [siren wailing] [groans] [groaning] [groaning] [chatting, music] [chatting, laughing] [wolf whistle] Hey, you wanna party? Where you goin'? What the...? Hello? I'm calling the police. Ray? Oh, my God! Did you break outta jail? Gimme your keys! I can't just give you my car. What the hell is going on? I need you to help me. My God! [groans] What is it? Oh, my God! Tia! Oh, no, no! Stop! Stop, Ray! [gasps] Oh, my God! Don't! Stop, stop! Please don't! Oh, don't. Ray! Don't! Don't, don't! Ray! No! Don't! [screams] Ray! [screams] [slurping sounds] [chatting] Dr. Allen. Jennifer Allen. Where is she? In the control room. Down this walk. Hey! God, Tom. You okay? Huh? No. Liz is dead, Tom. He shot her. What the hell happened? This man came. He started shooting. Damn. You sure you're okay? You should take her to St. John's, get her checked out. No, I'm fine. I just wanna go home. All right. Come here. I'll just let them check you out here and then take you home myself. Look, Mr. Michaels... Doctor. Right. Look, Doc, let us sort this mess out. I'll make sure you get a copy of the report. Good idea. He's a nice guy, huh? Yeah. A sweetheart. Walk me through it? A convict fakes out his guards and he makes a break in here. There's nowhere to go, so, pow, he pops the assistant right here. Yeah. Liz. Right. Shoots Liz, grabs Jen. Jen gets away. The guards and the perp start shooting and a round hits the gizmo over there. All right. The perp? Got away in the mess afterwards. Perfect. We got... We got a name. Ray. Ray Erickson. You're kidding! What? You've heard of him? Heard of him? I helped put him away. He's supposed to be on death row right now. He was. He was being transferred. Where? Here. Bellion Pharmaceuticals. Why? He was part of some kind of medical research program. We're gonna have to have another conversation with Dr. Michaels. I already got an A.P.B. out on Erickson. Nothing yet. Check the hospitals. Why? He was caught in the explosion. He was hurt pretty bad. Do you mind just giving us a minute? You didn't get hit? No. I was shielded by a table. I'm just... I'm just lucky, I guess. Oh, honey, honey. It's all right. I just don't know... It's not your fault, Tom. I just... I want you to get this guy, okay? I will. I promise. Humor me for a second. Dr. Michaels? Nice to see you again. I'd like to ask you about Ray Erickson. I'm not at fault here. Yes, he was scheduled to take part in my experimental drug testing program, but... What? Are you saying that you're experimenting on convicts? To put it bluntly, yes. In exchange for a reduced sentence, the subjects waive certain rights. I can assure you, it's all perfectly legal. He was just a name and a number to me, Lieutenant Randell. If there's anything I can do to help you... Tell you what. Please give me a call. Day or night. Okay. We got anything? No, nothing yet. All right. Honey, I think I'm gonna have to hang back, help wrap things up. No, no, you go. I got it. You sure? Yeah. All right. Just make sure... Yeah, I'll call you right away. No worries, boss. Now get outta here. Um-- Look. This guy Ray, he killed 12 people before we finally caught him. I just want you to keep that in mind. All right. Go on. You all right, hon? [Jennifer] Yeah, I'm fine. [heavy breathing] [buzzing] [Tom] Well, he certainly didn't just vanish. Has anybody checked the morgues? Maybe this guy didn't make it at all. Huh? In tonight's lead story, Bellion Technologies, You do that. Why don't you give me a call on the cell? a research firm dedicated to the eradication of the deadly Guilin Virus, was damaged in an explosion. I'm gonna stay here tonight. The cause is not known. Yeah, you too, baby. This is indeed a tragedy as 1,100 cases of the deadly Guilin Virus were reported today, bringing the total to 336,000 reported cases nationwide. Three years after the Guilin strain of the West Nile Virus made its first appearance, the government has hired companies to find a cure. Honey? I was thinking I'd just stay here tonight. Make sure you're okay. I'm all right now. [sighs] I'm glad you're staying. I wish I could stay a lot more. Just so busy at work, you know? I mean, hell, we both are. When we got the call that it was your building... I know, I know. Me too. Want some wine? Not tonight. Thanks. Actually, I'll have some orange juice. I can do that. What are you doin'? I don't know how much data we lost in the explosion. I just wanna see what I have backed up. Sweetie, don't you think that can wait? I need to do this, Tom. I have to keep my mind off of everything. It's all right. I understand. [keys tapping] [phone ringing] [ringing] This is Randell. Morning, honey. Coffee's ready. Is she doing better? Yeah, she's okay. Considering. You got something? Yeah. Dead call girl on 11th Avenue. You wake me up for this? Guess who she used to date. Are you talking about Tia..? Yep, that's her. -What's the address? -That's 375 11th Avenue. Okay, I'll be there in ten. Huh? Hey. Looks like we got something. Hey. You gonna be okay? Yes, of course. Maybe you should just stay here today, you know? Hmm? Take it easy. Hmm. Sure. I'll give you a call in a while. Okay. [siren wailing] Can you give me a second? Tom, take a look at this. Looks like she's a couple of pints low. Make sure we get a sample of this fluid back to the lab ASAP. I wanna know what the hell this is. Has anything been moved? No, sir. Definitely our guy. We gotta get back to the office. Dig up my old case files on Erickson. Then we gotta talk to everybody this guy even looked at. Because this... This is just the beginning. This is the way he did all his victims? Not even close. Multiple gunshot wounds, every last one of 'em. Looks like he's changing his style. Yeah. [Aaron] It's all gone, isn't it? Years of research, gone. We still may be able to salvage this. Let me see what we have backed up. The government contracts won't wait. I've already laid off all the research assistants. What? Why did you do that? We have nothing if we don't have results. The reactor was one of a kind, a prototype. You've ruined me. Excuse me? It was you who let him in. He had a gun to her head. What was I supposed to do? He killed her, Aaron. So it wouldn't have mattered. You've been drinking. You're right. Care to join me? Oh, God. [Aaron] We were so close, Jennifer. We could've had it all. Instead, you blew it. I'm holding you responsible. I won't forget this! [TV indistinct] How dare you! Who do you think you are? That prisoner you had brought here, you were gonna test the mosquitoes on him, weren't you? You were gonna break protocol and go behind my back. I was just wondering, Aaron, were you gonna give me any credit for any of the work I had done? Don't you have work to do? As you're so keen on reminding me, "people out there are dying." [sighs] Go save the masses. Go on, get outta here. You make me sick. [gagging] I don't understand. Fine. Find out what it is and hurry up, would ya? That goop from the body has the lab stumped. They're sending it to the federal lab. We need that information now, Charlie. I know. I'll stay on it. High school drop out. Plenty of friends, all the wrong kind. No real girlfriend 'til that girl from the apartment. Seems like your regular antisocial screwup. He definitely is that. All the interviews are the same. Nobody's seem him or heard from him ever since he went inside. Hospitals? No, nothing. No burn victims. Nothing unusual. All right. All right. So this guy, he didn't kill because he had to. He killed because he wanted to, because he got off on it. He's no genius, but he's smart enough not to stick around here. We gotta find something, man. We gotta find it fast. ♪♪ [rock] Yo, Barry! Should I get my own beer or what? Hey, Barry! [gasps] You scared the crap outta me, man! Is it gone? What? Come on, open the door. Is it gone? Is what gone? There's nobody out here. You've lost your mind, man. Where's Stevie? Where's Jake? What did you do, man? You better open that door and tell me what the hell is going on here. [thud] [slurping sounds] [grunting] Aah! Aah, aah. [screaming] [Barry screaming] You got anything? Got a couple of leads on some of his old hangouts. Sent some uniforms over to check 'em out. Nothing yet. Okay. Lieutenant Randell's office. What? Same M.O.? Right. Nobody touch anything. We'll be right there. Hang back. We'll call you if we need you. You're gonna love this. It's at the R & B Club. Geez, is our boy out of control or what? What the hell? Have you ever seen anything like this? Never. Something's not right about this. No. He goes psycho and takes it out on everybody else. No, no, no, no. It's more than that. Tom, where you goin'? I'm gonna go back to the lab, see if that reactor could've done anything to Ray. -What do you mean? -I'll call you in a few. [cell phone dialing] [Jennifer] Hello? You hungry? I'm starved. Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah, of course. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna swing by my place. Then I'll be there to pick you up. We'll go have some dinner. All right, honey. Love you. I'm gonna have a porterhouse and baked potato with everything. How do you like that cooked? Medium? Actually, rare, please. Very rare. Very well, ma'am. Thank you. Glad to see you've got an appetite. It just sounds good. That's the third time you've smelled those. They just smell so beautiful. Autumn's almost here. Might as well enjoy them while we can. All right then. [growling and snorting] [Tom] Thank you. You're gonna be all right talkin' about this, right? I'm fine. Do you think it'll help? Our regular leads aren't getting us anywhere. So what do you need? I just want you to go over it for me. When the explosion happened, this guy was completely exposed. Directly in front of it. And you said that he was burned pretty badly. From the explosion, yes. But not from the radiation. Why's that? It's just not that powerful. We use it to delicately alter the DNA of mosquitoes. It's basically harmless. So it wouldn't do anything to him at all? I can't say that for certain. But both the suspension and radiation sequence are geared specifically toward mosquitoes. Human DNA is just much more complex. And all mosquitoes drink blood, right? Most do, yes. That's how the Guilin Virus is spreading, through the bite. Is this about the case? I don't know. There's just some things at the crime scene that aren't adding up for me. I just wanna catch this guy. You know? Getting impatient, as usual. Mmm, what is that? What? Can't you smell it? Sweetie, what is it with you and flowers tonight? It's not the flowers. Yo, sucker! Park's closed after dark unless you wanna... Whoa! Oh! Oh! Hey, boy, you okay? [laughing] Uh, uh... Don't worry. Room for everybody. You want a drink? [screaming, glass breaking] [boy screaming] Sugar in your coffee. And now chocolate and soda. You okay? What do you mean? Thanks. You have to admit, it's a little out of character. This have anything to do with what happened at the lab? I don't know. [sighs] Could be. I mean, I saw Liz die. I'm sorry, Jen. I'm... I'm gonna catch this guy. Okay? I know. I'll do anything I can to help you get over this. I promise. There is something. ♪ You know your eyes are so dreamy ♪ ♪ You know the way I feel today ♪ ♪ Do you believe in us ♪ I pray our love will never fade away ♪ ♪ Do you believe in love ♪ Say you're never gonna leave me ♪ ♪ That you'll be with me 'til the end of time ♪ ♪ Save your love until you see me ♪ ♪ Never give another man your heart or mind ♪♪ Jen... Aah. Hey. Ah. Wait, wait. [phone ringing] My phone, my phone. Honey. Honey! My phone. [ringing continues] Sorry. Yeah. Huh? No, I'm on my way. I'm on my way. Yeah. Ah, where? No, I know. The old subway tunnels. I'll be there, 15, 20. It won't take me long. Whoo! Damn, baby! I'll be back as soon as I... Soon as I can. [groans] [crying] What have we got? A couple of bodies down in the tunnel. It's a real mess. Hi there, Tom. Sucked dry just like the others. Where's Morrison? He's over there. I'm here. You the gentleman that found these guys? Yeah. You know any of 'em? Nah, I never seen 'em before. That a map of this place? Mm-hmm. Let me take a look at that. Charlie. Where are we on this? Right here. The girl's apartment is right about there. The bar is right here. Well hell, the lab is only a mile east from here. That's right down this tunnel. Let me see your flashlight. I'm gonna take a look. Wait. You want some backup? Nah, I want you to find out why I don't have those lab reports yet. Guess you get the night off. Charlie! [running footsteps] Oh, my God. Ray? Come on out. Ray? Come on out. [snarls] Tom! Tom! Spread out. Canvass the area. Tom, you okay? Check anything that moves. What happened? What happened? I know what I saw, Charlie. He's a bug. No, no. More like a... Like a mosquito. Ah, come on. I'm serious! That explosion must've done something to him. I'm telling you. It must've altered his DNA somehow. It's dark down there. Come on, how long have you known me for? You think that I would lie about something like this? No, no, of course not. What are you lookin' at? Hey, hey, come on, man. Tell me. What do you want me to do? I can't put out an A.P.B. on a seven-foot mosquito. Yes, you can. You can, Charlie, and you're going to. That's an order! Or else more people are gonna die. All right. And make sure they know this thing has some kind of an armor plating. Right. I shot this thing point-blank. It didn't even flinch. Where you goin'? To find Jen. See if she knows some way to kill this thing. Make the call, Charlie! I'm on it. Make the call! Brenner. Yeah, Morrison here. It's mutating. [groans] Oh, no! This can't be happening! [crying] Oh, my God. [whimpering] [cell phone ringing] Jennifer? This is Frank at the lab. The federal lab. -You Lieutenant Thomas Randell? -Yeah, what do you got? I have the fluid analysis right here. But I've gotta ask. This a joke? I wish. What is it? Nasty stuff. It's mostly regurgitated blood. But also heavy traces of a specific enzyme, an anticoagulant actually. Keeps blood from clotting. But here's the thing. It's only found in biting flies and... Mosquitoes. Yeah, yeah. The sample you sent. Where'd you get so much of it? You don't wanna know. [Tom] Jen? Jennifer? [gasps] Oh, God, Tom. Get away from me. I gotta get you to the hospital right now. No, let me alone. Something's wrong here. Come on. Come on. Call St. John's. Tell 'em I'm on my way. Don't worry. We'll take good care of her. [thunderclaps] Tom. Just relax, all right? They sedated you. They're giving you a blood transfusion to try and slow this down. Not for long. You were exposed in the explosion, weren't you? Just my arm. I didn't think it mattered. I'm sorry, Tom. Oh, God, his pain must be tremendous. Well, he seemed pretty pissed-off when I ran into him. Look, Jen, I really need your help right now. This guy is leaving bodies all over the place. He knows we're onto him. Why is he sticking around? He's more mosquito than man by now. The needs of his new body will drown out any part of the man that's left inside. What are you saying? Mosquitoes don't have emotions or motivations, Tom. They're simple creatures. Then what do they want? Two things. To feed and... What? To mate. He wants to mate, Tom. That's why he's looking for me. How could he know? He knows. I felt him outside the restaurant. I felt him back at the lab. He's coming, Tom. He's just waiting. For what? For me. To finish... What? To finish what? To finish changing. Okay, well, that's not gonna happen. You hear me? And you don't have to worry about him getting in here because I got cops all over. Morrison's outside. That's not gonna happen. But I gotta know, how do I kill this thing? Too late, Tom. No, no, no. Jen... [siren wailing] [rustling sound] What? [gasping] [screaming] I'm gonna go get a doctor, okay? Mmm, no. Don't go. I need to get back to the lab. There's still time. No, Jen, Jen. Just relax. There's nothing that you can do at the lab right now. No, I have to. Jen, please. Go ahead. You said to let you know about anything strange. Yeah. What is it? Might be nothing. But we have a man missing. All right, ah... I'll be right out. I love you. [woman] She's not keeping fluids down. It's Guilin. I give her two days. Hey, how's she doin'? She was hit in the explosion only not as bad. Whatever's happening to him is happening to her, and he knows it. Will you stay here and keep an eye on her? Sure. Where you goin'? There's an officer missing. Hey, if he's here... Nothing gets by me, boss. You do what you gotta do. [snarling] Hey! You hear anything yet? No. It could just be a bad radio. -I want SWAT here in ten minutes. You got that? -Ten minutes? Or sooner! And make sure they bring enough A.P. rounds for everybody. Armor piercing? Just do it! Alpha One Five. Alpha One Five. Keep your eyes open, bud. It's gonna be a long one. Tom? No. It's me. Charlie. Um, Tom will be right back. Do I look that bad? No, I've seen worse. I'm scared, Charlie. It'll be okay. Don't worry. You'll be all right. [groaning] Jen? He's here! Jen? Keep... Aah! [groaning] [P.A. system] Paging Dr. Stayman. Dr. Stayman, please. -[screeches] -[gunshots] [gunshots continue] Go check out what it is and get your ass back here! You stay! I need a doctor in here! [cell phone ringing] Yeah? [static] Charlie? Charlie? Breaking up... Son of a bitch! [siren wailing] Somebody's got a gun in there. It's crazy. There's shooting! It's still in there. What's still in there? Gavney, Greenfield, Chimelis, get in there and find out what the hell's going on! Don't send them in there! [man] Look there on the third floor! I heard shots fired! All right, let's move it! Secure that building! Go! Go! Go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I gotta get in there. We're taking care of it. Just wait... I'm a cop, okay? You need to let us do our job, sir. You don't know what you're up against. Just wait here. Clear! Get back! Get outta the way! Clear. [sound of flapping wings] This will all be over in seconds. [snarling] Hold it. You can't go in there. Well, I'm goin' in. We've lost too many men. What about the woman, Jennifer Allen? I've got no idea. It's chaos in there. Nobody goes in after me. [screaming] [man] Paramedic! [policeman] He's gone. [sucking sound] Giggs! Poborsky! The cops. The SWAT. They're dead! -What killed them? -What do you think? Just shoot! [snarling] [snarls] Please. Please. [groaning] [struggling, screaming] Get away from her! [gunshots] [police walkie-talkie] Charlie. Charlie, come in. Over. Charlie. Come in, Charlie. No! I won't let this happen. Charlie. Over. [policeman] Freeze! [gunshots, snarling] [screaming] [snarling] What the hell is that? I say we get outta here now! Yeah. [clanging sound] Greenfield? [sucking sound] [screams] [groaning] [sirens wailing, horns honking] Hey! Hey, lady! You okay? Hold on. I'm gonna get you some help. Let's go. [sirens wailing] [thunderclaps] We need more paramedics here. We need more paramedics here. I said, we need more paramedics. Are you okay? We're gonna get you some help. Get out! Get out! Out! [policeman] Hey! You crazy? Wait! Hey! Stop! Come back! Jennifer! [woman cries out] [crying, heavy breathing] You okay? It's, it's not my blood. It's not my blood! Come on, come on. It's, it's over there! All right, get outta here. Go on! Hey! Mansquito! [snarls] [police radio, indistinct] Got a live one! Hang on, buddy. We'll get you out. I'm all right. Ahh. I'm all right! Jennifer! Hey, I thought you were gone. I gotta find her. Everybody's evacuated. There's nobody left inside but rescue crews. Okay. Okay. Where are you goin'? [Tom] Move! Move! [sirens wailing] [engine starting] [groaning] No. Oh, thank God. I hope you were right, Aaron. [blowing] [brakes squealing] [groans] What are you doing here, Jen? [Jennifer] You need to leave. What is that? Leave me alone, Tom. He's dead, Jen. It's over. N-No, he's not dead, Tom. He's alive. That's impossible. Listen to me, Tom. Without a mate, he'll soon die. There's gotta be some other way. I've released the altered mosquitoes that survived the blast. And if my calculations are correct, then the virus should die out soon. It's just a matter of time. Please, just stay away from me, Tom! There's gotta be something else. A cure. Something. But not this. No. No, there's isn't. I felt his need and my own. And I don't wanna become that. Let me go! [screeching] Jennifer, get outta here! [screeching] [screeching] Jennifer! [quiet growling] [quiet growling] [quiet screeching] [screeching] [slurping] [Jennifer yelling] Remember this? [zapping] [snarling] [Tom] Come on! Come on! [yelling] [zapping] [grunting] Stay back! Please! You're going to fry! [mansquito screeching] [silence] [computer keys clicking] [TV Reporter] It seems the end has come to the deadly Guilin Virus. The current number of new cases has dropped off to zero. No one is certain why the virus so rapidly dissipated. But naturalists are reporting a new breed of mosquitoes that seems to be incapable of carrying the virus and aggressively breeds out the dangerous virus-carrying mosquitoes. No one knows where these tiny saviors came from, but they have given new hope to both a city and a world on the verge of a massive epidemic. [Tom, narrator] In the end, I lost everything I ever cared about. The only woman I ever loved died saving us all. But as with every ending, there is always a new beginning.
