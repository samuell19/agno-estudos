Yes, it is such a sweet surprise. Anyway, why do you keep coming back from the men's room so wet? Took a shower or something? You'll catch a cold. Oops. l dropped my handkerchief.

That's wonderful! Since you've mentioned it, l told my parents about you and they're dying to meet you. lf it's okay with you, they're thinking of visiting Korea to see you. No, we should go and visit them. How about we go next week during the holiday? Sure. This may sound really corny, but my parents want us to go to a fortune-teller. That's not corny at all. Listen to the elders and you'll be rewarded even in your sleep, they say. - Shall we go? - Go where? There's a really good fortuneteller. No, l've actually reserved the best Let's go! How did you two come together? You know who you are! l don't know. Can't see anything. What should l do? l dunno. Brother, my life's so difficult. Why are you laughing? Because you are.

Have fun Those amateurs, how dare they try little tricks before us masters? Yeah, they're funny, huh? Anyway, your taste for women seems to have changed. l mean that woman looked old enough to be a teenager's mom. Oh yeah? When you walked in, l thought you were giving your old uncle a city tour. Hey, l'm still a head-turner. Last night at a club they asked me for my lD. Probably thought you were a policewoman under cover. Min-jun, l'm saying this out of genuine concern for you. Want me to fix you up with a nice girl? No need to be embarrassed. Okay! See that couple over there? You are amazing. That crazy bitch. You turn me on! Why the hell is she here? Let's forget about them. Yeah, let's. How about them over there? - Yeah? - How many minutes? Ten? Whoa, don't strain yourself. How about you? lt has to be fair. Ten minutes. What's in it for the winner? Let's see. The loser grants one wish whatever it is. Sure, l have a designer bag l want. lt's been a long time. What? Give up already? Give up? Ten minutes is too long for them l can smoke one. Yeah? Do you realize that 300,000 Won is burning at your fingertips? Then, l'll go first. - What? - lt's me! My new boyfriend has a son who is a real stud! He's supposed to be everything you wished for and more. Really? Yes! She's hotter than Britney Spears. lf you don't fall for her in 10 minutes, my pretty goddess will take us out to dinner. ls that so? - Sure, l'd like to meet her. - Min-jun. l've decided to take this. Yes, Dad. Alligator leather. lf only l hadn't smoked that one cigarette. - Satisfied? - Yeah. Sir, l'm sorry but your card's registered as stolen. What? No way. You fools. Remember me?
