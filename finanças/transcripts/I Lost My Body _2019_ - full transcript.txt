Naoufel! - Dad? - Yes, Naoufel. How do you catch a fly? - You aim off to the side. - That's dumb. You asked, I told you. A fly is faster than you. If you aim where it is, by the time you get there, it's gone. Take it by surprise. Not where it is, where it will be. The secret is to wait until it rubs its legs together and then... you aim to the side. It'll never work. A fly's eyes can see everywhere. That's true. But it can't guess you'll aim to the side. Go on, try again. - Some secret! - I never said it was easy. You don't win every time. That's life. I LOST MY BODY Argh! Beep. Beep. Naoufel! Mom? Your wrist. What now? The thing is, I like the piano. I'd like to give concerts like you with your cello. - Travel all over. - What your son is saying, is that he wants to be an astronaut! Not an astronaut! Astronaut, cosmonaut... I always mix them up. I want to be a pianist and an astronaut. That's my son! I want to be both. My little pumpkin. Naoufel! Two, three, four, five... That's six this week. How do you do it? Six late deliveries and it's only Wednesday! That's six free pizzas. Two a day. I'm sorry. You're sorry. Buy yourself a watch for Christ's sake! Haven't you forgotten something? Sorry! Leave a note, shit! What's up, baby? - Stop it! - He doesn't care. I'M WITH SANDRA Don't leave me like this! Check out that ass. You need a full-sized poster or what? Dumb shit. Sorry! You OK? Uh, yeah. Shit, shit, shit. Hey! Hey! Oh! Goddamn it. Yeah? Fast Pizza. Could you open the door? Didn't you forget something? Like an apology for being late. Sorry, I had a little problem. And how about "hello"? I said "Fast Pizza, hello." No, you said "Fast Pizza." Look, you want to open the door or not? I could be a pain and demand a free pizza. "20 minutes late, one free pizza!" That's what the flyer says. - I'm 20 minutes late? - Forty. So what now? It's up to you, Mrs Martinez. It's "miss." And Martinez was the last renter. They never changed the name. Anyhow, it was easier for deliveries and... Oh, forget it. I'll open, but I'm pissed off. 35th floor, door to the right. Thank you, miss. You have to wait for the end of the beep. Still not working? Nope. You sure you waited for the beep to end? Yes, I'm sure. Can you come down? One last try? OK. - Ready? - I've been ready for 20 minutes. It's official now, no tip. Hang on, I'll put a sweater on. I'm coming! - Don't bother. - Why not? The pizza and I had an accident on the way. - It didn't survive. - Nothing too serious? It looks like a pizza on top of a second half-eaten pizza. I meant you. You're OK? Me? No, I'm fine. It's nice to ask. You should change jobs. You're lousy at this. I know. My boss says the same. You should listen to him. Yeah. Look, why don't you just order another one? They're used to it. Have a good evening. You're still there? Fuck! Shitty night, huh? 35th floor, you said? Makes me dizzy just looking up! Is that my Neapolitan you're eating? Tastes good? The extra onions was a bad idea. You kidding me? What do you see from up there? I see your scooter. It looks run down. But if you look straight ahead, what do you see? Nothing. Just the horizon. - Must be peaceful. - What? I didn't hear you. I said, must be peaceful being cut off from the world! Nothing to see. Nothing to hear. You hear the rain? Rain doesn't make noise. Not up here, in any case. I hear the wind... When it whistles between the buildings, I get the impression... I'm on an ice field in the middle... of a storm. Safe inside my igloo. And when the wind is really strong, I can feel the building sway. I don't know... It's like... Like the whole world was drunk. - Gabrielle? - Hello, Mrs Lussac. Oh, my goodness, I don't know what I did. - I went out... - Your keys? That's exactly it, my dear! - If you don't mind... - The door's stuck, but I'll try. Thank you. I'll bring your books back tomorrow! I haven't forgotten. No rush. So you don't wait for the beep. Do you lend books often? Every weekday. I work in a library. You should go for it. It won't last. Go for what? It's stopped raining. I guess I should leave. Otherwise, you might be stuck here all night. That would be dumb. Goodbye, Mr Delivery Boy. Goodbye, Miss Martinez. Hello, may I speak to Gabrielle? I see, thank you. Goodbye. May I please speak to Gabrielle? Sorry, I dialled the wrong number. - Hurry up, I gotta shit. - It's occupied. What's he doing with the phone? May I speak to Gabrielle? Get outta there! You talking to me? - Gabri... - C'mon! - Gabrielle? - Yes. It's... Get outta there! Edison! That's it, good doggie. Let's go. Hello. Is Gabrielle here, please? - What for? - It's... personal. Figured as much. What's the name? It's... A surprise. - Gabrielle-- - No, that's OK! It's OK, thank you. I'll just... Where's the men's room? Gabrielle? Gabrielle! 35th floor, to the right. It's me, Naouf... It's Naoufel. You know, the delivery boy! "Fast Pizza, hello..." "Fast Pizza, hello." We talked over the interphone. I didn't know you worked here. It's crazy. She just left. Can't miss those fluorescent things on her ears. GUY DE MAUPASSANT LIBRARY Hi. Hi. Gigi! Hello. Can I help you? I'm here about the ad. You still looking for an apprentice? What ad? Oh, boy, this is old! Sorry. - Here, your meds. - Leaving already? I have to pick up my scooter. - Oops, sorry. - Sorry. - See you tomorrow, Gigi. - Goodbye, sweetie. Take me. You won't be disappointed. Watch out! The ad is 10 years old. I don't take apprentices now. What do you have to lose? My time. An apprentice means work and time. - I'm too old. - I can help you, I'm young. - I'm full of energy... - Help me? Help me with what? Look around, your workshop's a mess. You need help. I can help you. - Got any qualifications? - Sure, plenty. - I can... - I mean schooling. Experience. You ever work with wood? Trim, cut, sand, surface... Ever heard of that? - I'm a fast learner. - What did you do before? Do your parents know? They're dead. Dead? Why do you want this job? I don't know. You don't know. I don't know. - Sorry about that. - No big deal, it's just paint. Got a light? No, of course not. You'll be bored, there's not much business. On the other hand, it's true... It's a mess here. The workshop is big, and I'm... What's your name? Naoufel. There's a bedroom in the attic. It was for my apprentices. It's basic, but... it's better than nothing. Monday at 8:00 a.m. Aaah! What the...! Damn rats! Edison! Attack! Catch it! Go on, get it! I found a job, and an apartment. It's a fabulous opportunity. I think I'll accept it. Actually, I already said yes. Well, thanks for... putting me up and everything else. Hello? Hey, sex bomb! How about 8 p.m.? I don't know, what about you? No way! I'll tell you later. I'll tell you later. I said I'll tell you later! It's nothing. What do you think? Get lost, you're such a kid. Yeah. OK. Look, I have to go. See you at eight. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Bye. Naoufel! Ah! Get down here. - I'm coming! - Watch out for the crossbeam. Before giving you a piece to trim, you need to know your tools. And how to use them. Ready? We lift together. One, two, three... You have tools, accessories, and instruments. Watch out, cat. Tools, are what you use to transform matter. Put it over there. And lift. My workbench. It's an accessory. It doesn't transform matter. I use it to tighten, re-tighten, hold and support. Then you have instruments. Compass, square, ruler... Everything you use to measure and trace. Sketching is what's most important. After that, following the lines is easy. Anyone can do it. Good craftsmanship starts with a good drawing. But a drawing of what? - What's he doing here? - Helping me. Helping you do what? Stop working? - You don't even know him. - He's a poor kid. So what? Hello? You sure this job's for you? Yes, I had... a revelation. - Love at first sight. - For wood? What were you before? Delivery boy. Sushi. And you? You're sure not a nurse! - What do you do? - This will sting. - I work in a library. - Oh, yeah? Cool. Could I drop by? - To borrow books? - Yeah. Oh, I see. I'm a manual worker so I don't... - I don't read. - I wouldn't call you "manual." Can I have the war vet back? We have a client to see. There you go. Thanks. Going to the North Pole? Why not? Endless horizons. Light. It's so peaceful. Look, polar bears! What? - You don't like bears? - Sure, everyone does. They're cute. Like dolphins and kittens. I mean... all this empty space. Where do you see something like that? We'll never go there. We'll never see that. Except in a book. If you close your eyes and put your hands over your ears, then press slowly, one after the other, very gently. Like this. If you do it right... it's like walking in snow. Bring them back in four weeks. Otherwise the control tower will get you. - See you round. - Yeah. - Hello. - Hello. THE FAR NORTH Here. To excuse myself. I'm late. - Thanks, it's... - A bear. A bear-keyring. You said everyone likes bears. - I made it with an offcut. - Did we have a date? A date? No, I came to... Don't worry, no one ever asks for them. I have something for you too. The World According to Garp. It's my favourite book. - OK, I have to go. - Me too. Your uncle's waiting in the van. What're you doing here? Getting acquainted. Introduce us. Are you ashamed of me? Raouf. Gabrielle. What do you want? OK, mustn't overdo the good things in life. I told you, family isn't his thing. Thanks for the coffee, Gigi! - My respects, miss. - Bye. - Dumb jerk. - Nice to see you too! I'm counting on you guys tonight. - He's throwing a party. - A party? I said yes, but we don't have to. Sure, it's a good idea. - You'll pick me up? - OK. - Careful with my niece, Naoufel. - You serious? She's the one who wants to go. Follow me. I hope it's worth it. Well? What do you think? It's an igloo. You like it? You made this? Do you believe in destiny? I'm serious. As if everything was pre-written and we were on a path? - Yes. - And we couldn't change anything? We think we can, but it's an illusion. Unless you... do something totally irrational. It's the only way to ward off fate, for good. Something like what? Something like... I don't know, anything. You're walking along... You pretend to go one way... then you make a feint, like a dribble. You sidestep. And bam! You jump onto the crane. Something improvised that you shouldn't have done, but it's cool because it took you elsewhere. And you don't regret it. Something like that. And then what? Once you've dribbled destiny? Then what? You make sure it doesn't catch up with you. You charge... and cross your fingers. What? - Sorry. - What? Aren't you hungry? I ordered a pizza. I'M HERE It'll be cold. Hang on, I'm coming. You should've gotten sushi. Don't you get a discount? This is not just any pizza. What did you get? "Neapolitan, extra onions, Mrs Martinez." - It's... - It's me. The delivery boy. "Fast Pizza." That's what you ordered, right? "I always follow my job through. You know that." - The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. - Yeah, I know. Oh, yeah? It's my favorite film. Van Cleef is... What're you doing? What's your game? What? It's not a game. What's the goal? Screw a girl in an igloo? Is that it? Not at all. What do you think I am? After that night, I wanted to meet you. I found out where you worked and followed you. It's a simple story that I complicated. Are you listening? Yeah. What was I supposed to do? "Hi, I'm the loser delivery guy. How about a date?" Would that have worked? I took the job just to see you again. Isn't that kind of... - Chivalrous? - My uncle. Did you think of him? When will you tell him it's all bullshit? - Hey, I love this job. - He's sick! - No, he's just a little old. - Asshole. What? Is it serious? Where's your babe? She's not my babe. She's nothing. Get out of my face! Get lost. Hey, Corinne, we were talking about you. Sorry, that's my seat. Don't bust my balls, sit over there. You see, that's my drink. I just left a minute to... That was my seat. This is your drink? Should've told me sooner. Gigi? Gigi? Come here, you. ♪ She had a sweet little face ♪ ♪ She very softly replied "yes" ♪ ♪ For a spot under an umbrella ♪ ♪ A small spot of Paradise ♪ Ah! My mustache! What the...? You're recording again? Last time you promised we'd go to the party and we didn't. So now I record. The concert ended late and it was a school night. Tonight isn't, so I want a promise. - If your mother hit false notes... - I do. If she hit more false notes, she'd have fewer encores. - And that would mean... - Watch the road! - Well? - OK, promised. - Promised what? - We'll go to the party. If we make it on time to the concert. Naoufel. Naoufel! What? Don't lean outside. Get your hand inside! Watch out! Come here, you. Naoufel. I was at the hospital. I know you're here. Open up. I took care of the paperwork. You just have to sign. Come on, open the door. OK. Suit yourself. The World According to Garp Come here, you. - Well? - OK, promised. Promised what? We'll go to the party. If we make it on time... Woohoo! Wooh!
