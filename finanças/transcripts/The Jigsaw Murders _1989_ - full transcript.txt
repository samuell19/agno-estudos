[bashing] [shouting] - Jeez, he went out the window! - Stay on him, I'll cut him off. - Halt, police! You're under arrest. - Okay man, relax. - Out. [revving] [grunting] - Jesus, where'd you come from? - Joe, you okay? - Yeah. I lost track of you, partner. I wasn't sure I had a clear shot. - Hey, it's okay. I'll get out an APB. Hey pard, we avoided the use of unnecessary violence, didn't we? [somber music] - Let's go. Here all day. - [Woman] Leave me the fuck alone. - Book them. Need some help? - No, I got it, Paul. - Morning, Captain. [camera clicking] - Oh, this is a great lens. Elliot, I can even make you look good. So what do you think? - George, it's a wonderful camera and I'm sure you're a great photographer. - I will take beautiful pictures at your wedding. - Look, I appreciate the offer. But the thing is, Vivian and I agreed we'd have a simple ceremony. And it's just gonna be me and her and Joe and Deb. Debbie's maid of honor. - You know I won an award-- sorry. - George, it wouldn't be fair. - Elliot, please. A wedding is a joyous event. It is something to be shared. - You want my advice, Greenfield? Call it off. Bail it now while you can still take your balls with you. - [George] Don't listen to him, he's never even been married. - Fuck, I know better. I've seen the casualties. Like your partner. Shit, he's been through the nutcracker twice. Look at him. Do you believe this guy's only 35 years old? - Lay off the kid, will you Bauman? He's nervous enough as it is. - Hey, I was just joking around. I didn't mean nothing. - Do us all a favor and say what you mean. - DaVonzo, Greenfield, in my office. - Nice tie. - Big man. If he weren't soaked with Jack Daniels, I might even be scared. - Yes sir? - One of our black and whites picked up Mamoulian stalled on La Brea. The DA says he can get 10 years on a parking ticket. You did good work, both of you. - Thank you sir. - In the meantime, this just fell into our laps. It was pulled out of a storm drain last night near the river. - Oh god. - Some bag lady found its twin in a trash bin behind a shoe store on Welden. - Jane Doe? - [Captain] So far. No ID, no witnesses. - This is really sick. - Exactly, which means the media will eat it up. Now obviously, a timely arrest would be greatly appreciated by all concerned. - Where are the legs now? - Forensics. Talk to Dr. Fillmore. - I'm on the case, sir. - [Captain] Ah, Joseph. - Sir? - How you feeling? - In the pink. - I was told that you left the alcoholics rehab program. Now that concerns me. - Well enough's enough, they did their job. - Yeah, I've been reviewing your record. Seems you've been passed over for promotion twice in the past five years, both times for the same reason. Impaired performance due to the use of alcohol while on duty. - Well, that's in the past. I'm off the booze now. - Good. See it stays that way, huh? I could use another Lieutenant. - Thank you. - Can I help you? - I'm Kathy Vincent from Famous Actors, I'm here to read for the part of Luanne in Red September. - Right. Could you please take a seat? Somebody will be with you in a few minutes. - Okay. - Ah jeez. - Not a whole lot to go on, is it? - Oh no, there's plenty. If you know what to look for. A femur structure and calcium deposits indicate she was between 20 and 25 years of age. She stood about five foot four, weighed 110 to 120 pounds. She also exercised. Good muscle tone. - Oh jeez. - Any fingerprints? - [Dr. Fillmore] No, just cotton fiber. The killer probably handled the shanks with cotton gloves. - Cause of death? - Well it was a chainsaw. - Chainsaw? - You got sand in the leg hairs indicating that she was killed in the beach or at the desert. Rigor mortis prolonged behind the calf and the thigh will suggest that she was brought back into the city where the killer dismembered the remains leaving behind telltale tooth marks and lubricant residue. Am I good at this or what? - Excuse me. [chuckling] - What's with him? - Yeah, it really stretches the imagination. Why murder someone out in the boonies and go to all the trouble of dragging them back into the city just to cut them up, spread them around town? - Maybe it's your typical pathetic cry for attention. - Sort of makes you wonder why they just don't rent a billboard. Thanks Doc, you've been a big help. - [Dr. Fillmore] I've got something else for your notes. - What? - It's not exactly medical. The lady appreciated fine art. - Now, remember. You're a well bred girl from the suburbs. Suddenly thrust into a situation where you must survive by your own wits. Your father abandoned the family when you were three years old. Leaving you with deep, latent insecurities. At 14, you had your first sexual encounter with your parish priest. It was physically pleasant but left you morally confused. You like Chinese food, hate mathematics, and never return your library books on time. You got it? - [Kathy] I think so. - Okay, good. Whenever you're ready. Make me feel her. - Mr. Quigley! What are you doing with that knife?! [screaming] - Let her try that one more time. - That was good, Kathy. Can you try the scream one more time? Make it more Guidard and less De Palma. - Less De Palma. Oh! - O for six with five to go. Geez, you think at least one tattoo parlor would keep records of what designs they do for which customers. - What for? Make our job easier? We're not gonna find this bastard in the yellow pages, you know. - You okay, pard? - No, not really. I hate this kind of case. Young girl, mutilation. I tell you partner, I want this wacko's ass. - Well, I got a sawbuck that says we get this wacko's butt by Thursday. - [Joe] Why Thursday? - My wedding! - [Joe] Oh yeah. - Oh ho. Besides, I can't go on a honeymoon and leave you with an open file. Oh, no, this check. I gotta take this check to my travel agency. It was supposed to be there three days ago. - Grab some lunch. I'll pick you up in about an hour. - Where are you going? - Got a heavy date. Sorry I'm late. Just got handed a major case, homicide. - Well, let it never be said you put your daughter before the good citizens of Los Angeles. - Oh, come on baby, I was hoping we could spend some time together for once without having a fight. - Daddy, it's just I've been waiting here since one o'clock. You know, my time's valuable too. - I appreciate that, and I apologize. - [Waitress] Menu? - No, I'll have Beneshda with iced tea, please. - Make mine a cheeseburger, medium rare, some fried onion rings and a nice cold Heineken. - [Waitress] Okay, thank you. - You're drinking again? Hell, I knew you couldn't stay on the wagon. - My dear, do you have any idea how much beer it takes to get a man of my physical stature drunk? - No, but I'm sure you do. - Dammit Kathy, do you find it absolutely necessary to fight me on everything? - You always fought me. My boyfriends, my career. - Career. The day I see your name on a motion picture, that'd be the happiest, proudest day of my life. But as long as you insist on demeaning yourself by doing this modeling, hell, I'll say it, pornography. - Erotica is not pornography. Besides, I'm not doing that anymore. I'm a real actress now. - You got work? Paying work? - I'm in a showcase tomorrow night. - Hell, I, where? - At the Burbank Actors Theater at eight o'clock. - [Joe] I'll be there. - You will? - Yeah, it'll be fun to see my little girl in action. - Okay. - Did you catch the five o'clock news? - We were still on the road, sir. - Well, our Jane Doe killing made the number three spot. - We hit damn near every tattoo parlor in town. Combed the missing persons files but without a name or even a face, hell, we're just stripped. - Already the Chief's getting heat from the mayor's office. Now I need progress and I need it quickly. - We're doing our best, Captain. - Yeah well I appreciate that, Detective Greenfield. [man grunting] - Honey, don't worry. I have the plane tickets right here. Yes, and the travel agent confirmed. We have an ocean view room. [phone ringing] - Sergeant Davonzo. [grunting] - I'm nervous too, I know. I tell you what, when I get home, we can give each other a nice, relaxing massage. - You'll take a raincheck on that, detective. Looks like we got a lead on the Jane Doe case. - Honey, something just came up. Police work. Yeah, I know, okay, I gotta go. Be careful. Yes, I'm your kitty cakes. [man howling] - Kitty cakes, huh? - Hey, teen wolf, put a lid on it, will you? So what did the guy see? What did he say? - He said he'd only talk face to face. - Well, it should be coming up in the next block. Wait a minute, he's at a hotel? - [Man] They don't step in there, wait. Oh, shh, shh. - Well, it's about time. - Bauman, what are you doing here? - Try to keep your witness entertained. - What is he, royalty? - [Everyone] Surprise! [clapping] - You guys, jeez! - It was your partner's idea. - Well, maybe a condemned man deserves a proper sendoff, huh? - Hey, what does a man have to do to get a drink around here? - I got your drink right here! Put this on. - As you all know, partners spend a lot of time together and they talk. In fact, they tell each other certain secrets they probably wouldn't tell their own wives. Having been Elliot's partner for the past six months, I've fallen privy to certain intimate details regarding his romantic life. - [Bauman] Yeah, you or anybody who sits within 300 feet of his phone. [whistling] [tooting] - As I was saying. Having been made painfully aware of the magnitude of the depth and breadth of Elliot's sexual experiences, I could think of no greater gift to serve him on his wedding night than this. - [Man] Right, open it up. - Well go ahead, open it! - Okay, come on. - What do we got, what do we got? You can have a baby. [laughing] Thanks pard. - Hey, Martinez, what about your true gift? - Elliot, here's a little something to keep you entertained whenever she gets one of those headaches. [laughing] - I can imagine, George. [men laughing] - Martinez, didn't know you had it in you. - Hey, hey, I'm married, not dead. Actually, Bauman picked it out. - Everybody! - Ooh, look it dude, check it out. - Elliot! Meet a new member of the team. [men cheering] - Hey Joe, I thought you were off the sauce. - Hey, lighten up, compadre. It's not every day a man's partner gets married, huh? ♪ Hooray for Greenfield ♪ Hooray at last ♪ Hooray for Greenfield ♪ He's a horses ass ♪ Drink it down, down, down ♪ Down, down, down, down ♪ Down, down, down, down ♪ Down, down, down, down ♪ Down, down, down, down [cheering] - Congratulations, Greenfield. - [Everyone] Oooh. [sultry music] - [Man] Take him, honey, take him. Woo, yeah whoah! Let's see it, let's see! All right. [men cheering] [tense music] - Thank you very much. [mumbling] Here's 20. Thank you. If you get any more, you wouldn't be able to take it. You've got a great future! [clapping] - All right, Davonzo, just what the fuck do you think you're doing? - Look at this. - Sorry man, it ain't the same. - The snake tattoo on the right side of the model's body is the same tattoo we found on the right leg of our Jane Doe. - Let me see that. - It's a two sided puzzle, it can give us her face. - Hold it, Davonzo. You're saying you threw that broad out just so we could put together a fucking jigsaw puzzle? - Filla, we're still cops. We got a psycho out there making kindling out of young girls and this is our first solid lead. Now. [crashing] Any volunteers? - Hey, I think I got another piece of her ass. - No way, Bauman. - Wait, wait wait. - Come on, Bauman, I think it was there. - Let me see that. - [Bauman] Yep, I think I got another one. Let's see, yep. All right. - [Martinez] I think I'm going blind. - Okay, we're home here. You do the honors. - Okay, that's it. - Get the camera. Ready, alley oop. - All right just hold it real so I can open all the way up. [camera clicking] One more. My god. [tense music] [screaming] - [Joe] What's that address again, Elliot? - 13772 Superior. - [Joe] Bad hangover, huh? - Industrial strength, partner. - No, no, no, no. What you wanna do, you want to take half a cup of Worcestershire sauce, drop a raw egg in it, and a teaspoon of tabasco sauce and my dad's secret ingredient, a pinch of oregano, not that thing. - That'll make me throw up. - Of course, that's the whole idea. Then the hangover feels so good by comparison, you think you feel better. [machine humming] - This is where we stamp the puzzles. Every party puzzle uses the same die cut. 78 pieces. We figure people ain't exactly buying the product for the intellectual challenge, if you catch my drift. [laughing] - You do your own photography? - No, I wish. No, we buy from freelancers. Mostly Hollywood types, if you get my meaning. - I get it. Mr. Murch, would you happen to know who took this photo? - All right, let me see. This issue is about six months old. I'll have to check my records. Hold on, hold on. I know it's here somewhere. - Can I use your phone, Mr. Murch? - Yeah, go ahead. I was afraid of that. We changed our filing system about three months ago and ever since then I haven't been able to find squat, if you'll pardon my French. - Davonzo here. - There's really a market for these puzzles, Mr. Murch? - Son, there's a market for everything. Prefaded blue jeans, strawberry douches. It's what makes America great. - We'll be right there. I'm afraid we're gonna have to be moving along, Mr. Murch. Here's my card. If you find that name, give me a call, will you? - Will do, Sarge. - What's up, Joe? - It's the same girl all right. The skin matches to a T. Plus we have the same deposits of sand on the pores. She must have put up one hell of a struggle on the ground before they finally snuffed her. - Oh, jeez. - You're assuming it was a guy? - Dr. Tyrone Fillmore assumes nothing. This hand's got skin under the fingernails. Blood is male, type B negative. - Rare. - Belongs to only about 10 percent of the US population. - Could you narrow that down a bit? - Sure. Just look for a man with three long scratches somewhere on his body. - I suspect we are in fact dealing with a classic sociopath. - You mean psychopath. - No, there is an important difference. Psychopaths, Newark's Son of Sam, for example, are violent schizophrenics. Their thinking is highly disordered and they tend to kill in response to their own emotionally charged delusions. Sociopaths on the other hand tend to lack a key emotional component, empathy. They cannot feel for other people. As a result, they see themselves as outside of society. Above it really. Ultimately they develop contempt for the rest of us. Any questions? [phone ringing] - Sergeant Davonzo. - Dr. Lester, what sets this kind of person off? What's the trigger? - Sergeant, it's me, Leon Murch. I finally found that photographer you were looking for. You still want the name? - [Joe] Please. - It's Mosley, M-O-S-L-E-Y. Calls himself Ace if you can believe it. - [Joe] Yeah I can believe it. You got an address? - Or it could be some perceived slight. Or perhaps an accumulation of personal and professional frustrations. - Thank you, Mr. Murch. You've been a big help. Dr. Lester, I'm afraid you'll have to excuse us. Elliot, we're on a roll. [tense music] - Let's get them! - No, no, forget it, forget it. We've got more important things to do. [buzzing] - Ah, it's a great neighborhood. I feel like I should be wearing rubber gloves. - [Man] Yeah? - Mr. Mosley? - It's about time. Top of the stairs, second floor. [light music] Oh, Nancy, looking good. Tongue action, Nance. Eve, I want you to take your finger, run it over your tongue, nice and slow. Index, yep, beautiful. Softer, softer. Okay, now run it down on your nipples, baby. All right, nice and soft. Bring those nipples up, baby. Hey, come on Nance, tongue action while she's doing that. Do it again, tongue action! All right come on, tongue, kiss, kiss, kiss. Let's get a kiss shot, come on. All right, oh I love it, I love it. Nipples up, here we go. Come on, one more. One more beauty, come on girls. That's it, all right. Let's try it again. Bring that leg up now. Bring that leg up, Eve. Eve, bring it up, just bring it up. Miles, let's go with it. Come on, that's nice Nance, come on Eve. A little action, tongue action. [clearing throat] - Mr. Mosley? - Yeah, put it right there on the table, will you? Hope you didn't forget the mustard. Come on girls. Nice. - We're police officers, Mr. Mosley. - What? - I'm Sergeant Davonzo. This is Detective Greenfield. - Come on, guys. This is strictly by the book, okay? First amendment. - We'd like to ask you a few questions about a murder. - A murder? Excuse me. Uh, girls, it's wonderful, okay. Let's call it a day, okay? Nice work. - [Woman] Okay. - Look, I'm sorry, officers. It's just I've had a lot of harassment problems in the past. What's this you tell me about a murder? - We're trying to get a name on this girl. People at Party Puzzles said you sold them the photograph. - [Mosley] This is the girl that was murdered? - We think so. - Somebody chopped her into pieces. - Really? Jesus, who'd do a thing like that? - Well if you can help us with her name, maybe we can find out. - You know, I remember. I think I took pictures of her last year. You guys wanna wait around a couple minutes, I'll go check my logbook. - Please. - All right, make yourselves at home, huh? Enjoy the scenery. - [Joe] Guy's into karate. - These black and whites, you took these? - [Mosley] The nature shots? - They're beautiful. - [Mosley] Thanks. A lot of work went into those. - You sell them? - I'm trying. As a matter of fact, I just started talks with a major gallery. With any luck I sell enough, I can finally get out of this skin game once and for all. [tense music] Some people think shooting skin is a dream job. But it ain't. It's dull, boring and demeaning. Sure, it pays well. But as soon as I can quit, I'm out of here. She called herself Cynthia James. Probably a pseudonym. Most models don't use their real names. Kinda goes with the territory. She was really something, wasn't she? - You got an address? - Probably not any good. They move around a lot. - Well, we appreciate your help. - Good luck. Hope you catch this killer. Between you and me, I hope the bastard fries. - They use the gas chamber in California. What do you think, Sarge? - About what? - About Mosley. You see that look in his eyes? The man is weird. Hey! - Oh fuck, they're back! - Stop! I'm a police officer, you're under arrest! [energetic music] Unbelievable. Breaking into a police car. Talk about nerve. - Brass ones all right. Let's check out that address. - Evan Stone agency. - See, she lived here. Moved out two months ago. Only her name was not Cynthia James. It was Cindy Jakulski. Said she was an actress. Actress, hah. You know what that means. Hooker. Probably got killed by one of her Johns. - You know where she went? Did she leave a forwarding address? - I wish she did. She still owes me two months rent! - Do you happen to remember anybody came by to see her, anybody in particular? - Like Ace Mosley? About 40, medium height, brown toupee? - Listen kid, all cucarachas look alike, you know. - Well, thanks for your help. If you happen to think of anything else, would you give us a call please? - Scum of the earth. They should all choke on their own vomit! - Yes Ma'am. - Yes Ma'am. Is it that this Cindy was a model, is that what's eating you, Joe? You worried about Kathy? - Hey, give it a rest, okay? - Whoah cowboys, party's over. - Davonzo. - Yeah? - We put out a bulletin on your girl to all the TV stations and newspapers. - Any feedback? - The usual. - Mostly creeps wanting to know if the dame's got a sister. - Well, some people are sick, bow wow. - Sergeant Davonzo, some guy's holding on two, says he'll only talk to you. - Davonzo. - [Man] You want to know who killed Cynthia James? - What's your name, please? - [Man] Meet me at 202 Hogan Avenue at eight o'clock. Come alone. - How do I recognize you? [phone clicking and dial tone] Hello? - Who was that? - Our friend, the Greek one, Mr. Anonymous. Wants to meet me at eight, says he knows who killed Cynthia. - Oh no, no, no no. No more bachelor parties. I'm serious. - No, it's okay. I'll handle this one on the way home. - What, alone? - That's the way he wants it. - You think that's such a good idea? - It's probably just a crank call, wild goose chase. Believe me, your time is better spent with your bride to be now. Go on, get out of here. - All right. You be careful. [crickets chirping] [gun firing] [tense music] [gun firing] [gun firing] [shattering] [tense music] [gun firing] [bashing] [Joe groaning] [gun firing] [bashing] [splashing] - The lady doctor was right. This nutcase is playing games with us. Mosley wanted me to find that torso. - Mosley? You said the man wore a mask. - He also knew karate. - [Captain] So? - So Mosley's a black belt and I need a warrant to search his studio. - Okay Joe, I'll see what I can do. - I cannot hate, my dear lord. Therefore far unfit for me to love. - How can I love him that has dealt so hardly with my father? - Bless you, my children. [crowd applauding] - [Woman] Hey Kat, what do you think? Were we great or what? - Yeah. He wasn't there. - Who? - Who do you think, my father, LA's finest. - Well I'm sure he had a reason. - Well he always has a reason. All I've done all my life is listen to his reasons. Should have known better than to expect anything from him. I was just setting myself up for another slap in the face. [sighing] - Kathy. I'm sorry I'm late. I heard the applause, you must have been wonderful. - Well, it was an ensemble effort of course. - Would you excuse us please? I'd like to talk to my daughter alone. - I'll be outside. - Okay. - I see you dressed for the occasion. - You don't talk to me like that. I had a reason for being late. I was chasing a killer. - Well did you catch him? - No, actually he got away. But I know who he is and I think you know him too. - [Kathy] Me? - Yeah. His name's Ace Mosley. He's a photographer. - Hmm, Mosley, doesn't ring any bells. - Maybe this'll ring a couple for you. When I first saw this, I felt sick. Then I got scared, very scared. Now I'm telling you right now, young lady. You stay away from him, from all of them. And that's a direct order, understood? - Daddy, that picture was taken almost two years ago. - That doesn't change what I just told you. I don't want you parading your body in front of them damn cameras anymore! - Oh I see. This doesn't have to do with the killer. This has to do with you trying to control my life just like you've always tried to do. Well daddy, it never worked then and it sure as hell won't work now. - Will you listen to what I'm trying to tell you? - Why? You never listen to me. You're always too busy chasing killers to ever care what happened to me. And before you start telling me how to run my life, why don't you try getting your own act together? You know what you are, daddy? You're a damn hypocrite. It's too damn stuffy in here! [door slamming] [somber music] [projector clicking] - Hollywood detectives report they still have no solid leads in the brutal murder of an unidentified female whose dismembered remains were discovered earlier this week. So far three limbs and a torso has been recovered. Although without the head, detectives say they cannot get a positive ID on the victim. In a possibly related story, LAPD is asking anyone with knowledge of the missing whereabouts of Hollywood model Cindy Jakulski. [tense music] Two boys were in critical after a schoolbus veered out of control jumping the sidewalk between the boat and the concrete wall. Police encountered five murder charges against a 17 year old girl who allegedly laughed at her poor daughter in a plastic bag left in the dying street. [shattering] [somber music] - Hmm, impressive. Very impressive. Good use of light and contrast. You've managed to capture excellent detail. - Thank you. I use very long exposures. Brings out the highlights. - Do you have any more? - Yes, but I consider these my best. - I see. - So what do you say, Mr. Saint John, care to choose three or four of these for your gallery, see how they sell? - Can I have a print of each? I'd like to show them to your partner. - I thought you made the decisions. - Well I like to get Jeff's opinion whenever I can. - So you don't make the decisions. God, I hate this. You guys, you just love to jerk people around, don't you? - What? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything personal. I just had some bad news. My mother, she's very ill. I've been trying to buy this condo for her. And the bank, for six weeks in and out of escrow. They finally turned down my mortgage application. - Of course, I understand. - Here, let me go get the prints for you. - Well you know what they say. You are what you eat. You're also where you eat. At this girls system is full of garam masala, turmeric, cardamom. - Translation please, doctor? - Spices. Used heavily in Indian cooking. - So you're saying that her last meal was at an Indian restaurant? - No, not just her last. That stuff is everywhere, from her esophagus to her bowels. I say she was a regular. Although god knows how she stomached the stuff. Donut? - Pass. - You know, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. [crunching] [phone ringing] - [Woman] Evan Stone Agency. - Yes, this is Peter Gable, photographer. I believe you have me on file. - [Woman] Yes, Mr. Gable, how can I help you? - I'm interested in hiring one of your models. - Oh my god. Of course I know Cindy. But not this way. She has been working in my restaurant as a waitress from the past three to four months. - When was the last time you saw her, Mr. Shandar? - Oh maybe about three to four days? I'm very very worried about her. Has something happened to her? - You haven't seen the papers? - I'm sorry. I have so very little time. - Do you have an address on her or do you know anybody she hung out with? - Uh, Megan. - Yes, Mr. Shandar. - Officer, this is Megan McDonald. - How do you do? - Hi. - She and Miss Jakulski are, how do you say, roommates, right? - Mhmm. - Roommates. Excuse me, I'll take this. - Thank you, table number three. - Sure, excuse me. - I knew it. Cindy's in trouble, isn't she? - Well we have reason to believe she may be a victim of foul play. - It's all right, we're not really sure if she's dead. - Dead? - I mean we haven't made a positive ID. I'm sorry, here. Here's a chair. I'm sorry. - You all right? Sure? I hate to ask you questions at a time like this but when's the last time you saw your friend? - I don't know. Last week sometime. - She hadn't been home since? - [ Megan] No. - Didn't that worry you? - Cindy's gone lots. And lately she's been spending some time with some photographer. - What was his name? - God, I can't remember. Ace something. - You're kidding. We can't get a warrant? - Look, I know it sounds crazy, Joseph. But without a definitive link between Mosley and the dead girl, we've got nothing to base a warrant on! - Links, I'll give you a link. Link one, Mosley lied to us about the last time he saw Cindy Jakulski. Link two, her roommate now places Mosley with Cindy right around the time of the murder. - Yes, but we still don't know that Cindy Jakulski and our Jane Doe are in fact one and the same. Now all we've got is a missing model, a questionable tattoo, and a set of fingerprints from a dismembered hand that matched nothing in the files. Yeah. It is frustrating. But the law is the law. - Well what can we do, Joe? I mean I know Cindy is our Jane Doe and I got another 10 bucks that says Mosley killed her. - Well fortunately there's no law that says we can't go talk to the man again, right? - Right. [somber music] [buzzing] I don't think he's in. - Did you hear that? - Hear what? - A woman screaming. - No, that was a car screeching. - Sounded like a woman screaming to me, right? - Right. - Yeah. [bashing] [tense music] Check the bedroom for anything Cindy might have left there. - I hope this is kosher. - I'm Italian, go on. Oh my. My my. What have we here? - All right, how's this? Cindy and Mosley are shacking up. Mosley gets jealous because Cindy is posing for other photographers. Hey! - Hold, he's back! - You're under arrest, I mean it! Hey, wait up. [tires screeching] - That's nice, that's great. Okay, come on. Break my heart baby, come on. Turn me on. Sex, come on, sex. Here we go, we're looking good. I wanna fall in love with you. Make my limbs melt. That's better, that's better. Okay, beautiful. - Did we work together before? - No. - You had a mustache? - Okay, raise your leg up for me, okay? That's it, nice. Give me some buns, baby. Buns, I love buns, okay. - How'd you hear about me? - Oh, through a mutual friend. - Really, who? - Joe Dafonzo. - Never heard of him. - Really? Well he knows you. In fact, he likes you a lot. Ah, oops, that's the end of the roll. Okay Kathy, let's take five. - And this girl's dead? God, mmm-mmm. What a waste. - Hey, out of my way, you're blocking my view. - Excuse me. - Hey, behave yourselves. Police evidence, not a peep show. - You don't know what you've got here, Davonzo. If I were you I'd make duplicates and charge admission. - If you were me I'd eat my gun. - Joe, look at these rock formations. These are the same ones Mosley shot in black and white. - I think you're right. So we know he's a creature of habit. This whole group is dated April six. - Just three days ago. - Joe. Take a look at what I just pulled off the computer. Mosley's been arrested half a dozen times for assault. Served three months in Arizona for beating up a prostitute. He's a real prince, this guy. - This is beautiful. Blood type, B negative. - Perfect. - Now if we just knew where these were taken. - Joe, I know this place. It's out near Joshua Tree. I've taken some nice shots out there myself. - I like it. - You're good, Kathy. You like the camera and it likes you back. - Thanks, Mr. Gable. - Why don't you call me Pete? - Pete? - I got one or two projects coming up I thought you could handle very well. You interested? - Uh, talk to my agent about that. - I'd rather deal directly. Yeah, save yourself the 10 percent. - Ah, I don't work like that. If you want to get in touch with me, call Evan Stone, okay? - Integrity, I like that. And I like you. - Bye. - I'll be in touch. Soon. - Hi, Evan, it's Kathy. Hi, listen, I really appreciate the work and everything but if this guy Peter Gables calls again, could you just tell him I took a four week gig in Hawaii or something? [helicopter blades whirring] - Hey. This could be theirs. [tense music] You got anything, Joe? - Hold on. I may have something. [flies buzzing] Some things you never get used to. - Honey. Don't worry, I'll be there. My appointment isn't for another hour. Right. Besides, they say that it's bad luck for the groom to see his bride on the day of the wedding. Oh. No, I don't think this morning counts. Look, I gotta go. So I'll see you at three? Mhmm. I love you right back. Bye. - [Mosley] Look you guys, you had me here for an hour. - Coffee, sir? - Yeah. - May I call my lawyer? - We haven't charged you with anything yet, Mr. Mosley. You're just here for questioning. - Fine, question. What more can I tell you? - Well, you could start by telling us why you lied to us about the last time you saw Cindy Jakulski. - [Mosley] I told you. You said she was murdered, I got scared. - Not very brave. - [Mosley] I never said I was a hero. - How is it that the date on your slides places you and the victim at the scene of the crime right around the time our ME said the murder was committed? - I took those shots weeks ago. Just took me a while to have them developed. - Or that your blood type matches that found under the fingernails of the victim? - Me and a million other people. Do you have any other questions? - Yeah. What's hydroquinine? - It's a photo developer, why? - Traces of it were found on the girl's throat. - Okay. So she was killed by a photographer, maybe. Check the phone books. I have a lot of competition. - Can you account for your whereabouts on the afternoon of Saturday, April six? - I was in my dark room all day. - Can you prove it? - No, I don't have to. You have to prove I wasn't. That's the beauty of this American Criminal Justice system. - You're very cool about this, Mr. Mosley. - That's because I didn't do it. But I can tell you something about the guy who did. - Like what? - Like he's enjoying all this. Like I figure, he's leaving all these parts around town so you guys run around like a bunch of keystone cops which I exactly what you're doing. Now I don't know much about the law but I do know that all the evidence you have right now is circumstantial. And that's all you're ever gonna have. - This guy must be pretty smart. - Obviously. He's already shown he's smarter than you. Before this entire city, he's proven that his mind, his talent, is far superior. This man is an artist. - You speaking from experience, Mr. Mosley? - I didn't murder Cindy. - Try this one on for size. You come home one night, you find her with another guy, you have a fight. - [Mosley] I loved her. - You take her out to the desert and you kill her! - No. Come on Dafonzo, gimme a break, will you? Do I look like the kind of a man who would go out and murder a woman that he loved? And then chop her up with a chainsaw and scatter her around like meat? I am not that kind of man! - Chainsaw? Nobody ever said anything about a chainsaw. - [Mosley] Don't play that old trick on me. - We reported the body was dismembered. We never said how. What do you say, Ace? Could be our killer isn't the artist you think he is? - I wanna see my lawyer. And I wanna see him now. - [Elliot] Punch nine to get out. - All right, Davonzo! [men cheering and clapping] - [Man] I hear you guys really nailed the slime. - [Man] Well, you gonna tell us about it Joe? - Details to follow in the 11 o'clock news. [men laughing] Just now my partner has what might be referred to as a rather pressing engagement. [men oohing] [men humming wedding march] - Last chance. [laughing and clapping] - The ring, please. - The ring. Okay. - Place and hold the ring on her finger and repeat after me. I give you this ring. - I give you this ring. - In token and pledge of my constant faith and love. - In token and pledge of my constant faith and love. - By virtue of the authority vested in me by the City and County of Los Angeles, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. - Well Joe, you've been married before. Any advice for me? - Well, for openers make sure she knows her place. I mean you're a cop. Demand a hot meal on the table no matter what time you get home. Make her account for every red cent she spends. If she ever weighs more than three pounds than she does right now, threaten her with physical violence. And spend at least, and I repeat, at least four nights a week out going around with your old pals. You stick to that formula, and I guarantee you'll be a two time loser just like me. - I got you. - Elliot, limousine's waiting. - Right, gotta go. See you in a week? - You will. - And about Mosley, you owe me a sawbuck. - I was kind of hoping you forgot about that. - Uh huh, uh huh, sure. You behave yourself? - Oh yeah. - Come on babe. - Bye. [sobbing] - Davonzo. Captain's been calling for you and he doesn't sound happy. - Really? Yeah, you looking to see me, Captain? - Yeah, close the door. Sergeant Davonzo, you know Assistant District Attorney Alvin Durkee? - Yeah, yeah, how you doing? - Frankly, I could be better. - [Captain] Mr. Durkee has been assigned the Mosley case. - Well I don't want any plea bargain on this one. If there was ever a candidate for the gas chamber, this wacko's it. - And I'd love to send him there. Only we have a problem. - No way. I got him nailed to the cross. - Are you familiar with the term fruit of the poisoned tree? It means that if a piece of evidence is obtained illegally then any subsequent evidence obtained as a result of the initial search is also inadmissible? - We don't have that problem here. - Your break-in at Mosley's studio this morning where you found the slides? - It was a righteous entry, we heard a scream. - From where? A deserted studio? - So maybe we heard something else. It was an honest mistake. - One that any defense council will easily expose as a cheap trick we all know it to be. - Hey, wait a minute here. Who the hell signed you on anyway? - Our side. I wanna win this. Only we lack probable cause. That means we lose the break-in. That means we lose the slides. That means we lose the girl's head and Mosley's interrogation. Couple all that with your documented predilection for drinking on duty! - Now hold on, Turkey. - Durkee. - We all know Mosley's guilty as sin. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Then what about the scratches? - The scratches? - The ME said the killer should bear three long scratch marks. - This guy is jerking us around. You can't just let him walk. - Frankly Sergeant, you leave me no other choice. You blew it. And believe me, no one is more pissed than me. I would have killed for this conviction. Good day, gentlemen. - You're not gonna let him do that. - We have no case. - Give me a break. - A break? I handed you a major case when everybody else said Joe Davonzo couldn't cut it anymore. I stuck my neck out because you used to be a good cop. So I figured you deserve a second chance. Something's wrong. Your judgement's a little out of whack. Too much booze, too much mileage. I don't know, but whatever it is, you have seriously compromised this investigation. No. I'm sorry, Joseph. I'm afraid there isn't anything more I can give you. - [Mosley] All right you buttfuckers, I'm out of here. Alex. - Ace. - [Mosley] It's about time. - Got here as soon as I could. - Thank you, bye boys. - How are you? - Bad. - Well tell me about it. I gotta be in court in 20 minutes. - I wanna tell you something. I don't know what they're up to but I didn't do it. - We'll talk about it. - One second. - No no no no no. - Sergeant Davonzo. I just wanted to say no hard feelings. I realize you're just trying to do your job. - You better keep looking over your shoulder, Ace. You so much as let a parking meter expire I'll be on you like ugly on leap. - That sounds like threatened harassment to me, Sergeant. - You call it what you like. - Come on, let's go. - Hey, what's this? Do I know this chick? I worked with her, as a matter of fact. Is this your girlfriend? - That's my daughter. - No kidding. Well you should be proud. Very proud. Lady's got a great set of tits. [men screaming] - [Mosley] I want this on record! - You come near my kid, I'll kill you! - I want her name right there! - Sergeant Davonzo! [tense music] - I know. [camera clicking] - Good. All right, now turn your head like, just a little bit more to the right. All right, that's good, that's good. Now think of say, 100,000 in small bills. - Ooh, that's something a girl can make sacrifices for. [laughing] - That's good. That's good, I love it, that's great. [bell ringing] - Oh that must be our roommate. Just a minute. Little miss efficient is always forgetting her keys, hang on. Come a little early, aren't you? Oh daddy. - What the hell is this, you open the door without even checking to see who it is first? Why are you dressed like that? - Nothing. - What's going on here? - [Kathy] Daddy. - You! Get the fuck out of here. - Hey look man, it's no problem. I was just leaving, okay? Hey come on, I said I was leaving! - How dare you! - This morning we arrested Ace Mosley for murder. Only we couldn't hold him. He's free. And he says he's been working with you. - Oh Christ, your breath's like a distillery. - Why won't you listen to me?! - Let me go! Okay, I worked with Ace Mosley, only he was calling himself Peter Gable. When I figured out who the creep was, I told him to bug off. It's no big deal. - Big deal, the man's a stone cold killer! - Oh stop it! You can't scare me into liking you. You're trying to run my life and I'm sick of it. Mother was right for walking out on you. You're nothing but a bully. She couldn't take it any more and neither can I you stupid old drunk! [slapping] [sobbing] - Look what I have for you. - Mm, thank you. No, no you don't. [knocking] - What's that? - I don't know. [knocking] - Debbie. Debbie, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me go check it out. Hang on, hang on. I'll be right back. Try not to lose the mood. [banging] - Elliot. - Oh, dammit. Who is it? - [Man] It's the manager. I have it on account from a reputable pedophile that you have a little girl in there. - Joe? - Do you realize you left this out in the hall hanging on your door for somebody to walk off with it? And you wouldn't have it anymore. - Joe, what are you doing here? - Oh, I just wish to see the inner sanctum of the honeymoon suite. They give you a heart shaped bidet or something? American Standard, made in the USA. Does that matter to me? You bet it does. - Joe, it's after 11 o'clock at night and you're drunk. - It's just powers of observation, boggle the mind. You have the makings of a very fine detective. God I'm parched. Where'd they hide the overpriced booze? Oh. - Elliot, what's going on? - Debbie, you remember Joe Davonzo, my best man. - Yes, I remember Joe. What's he doing here? - Official business. Mosley walked. - You're kidding. - Nope. It appeared that your old Sarge is fucked up. That's technical talk. Don't feel bad if you don't understand it. [somber music] Mosley's on the loose. He's fooling around with my daughter. She called me stupid old drunk. Elliot, I'm scared. Everything's coming unglued. And I just don't wanna spend the night alone, okay? - It's all right. It's all right, Joe. - No, Elliot, it's not all right. - Debbie, Debbie, he's my partner. I can't send him back on the street like this. It's all right Joe, you can sleep on the couch. - Mrs. Greenfield. I know it appears as though I'm lousing up what should be a very special evening for the two of you. But in reality, I'm doing you a phenomenal favor. 'Cause you know what happens in nine months after the human gestation period is completed? - No, what? - Kids. And you don't want kids, ever. Know why? 'Cause you give them everything. Then they break your heart. Good night. - Elliot, stop him! - Joe, Joe! Joe! Joe? [blinds clacking] - [Joe] Oh god. Somebody shot me through the head and my brains are leaking. - Good morning, Joe. You sleep well? - What time is it? - It's almost 9:30. [coughing] - Oh shit, partner. I'm sorry. I'm a real class asshole. Where's Debbie? - She's downstairs. - I owe her an apology. - She's not speaking to you. In fact, she's barely speaking to me. - Well you can hardly blame her. - Why do you do it, Joe, why do you drink, huh? - Shit. Does it really matter? - It matters because I'm your partner. Because I care about you. Come on Joe, you owe me. - You know Elliot, you really are a good human being. I think what I like most about you is you still have your illusions. When really, I had them once myself. Over the years I, guess I just saw one too many junkies. One too many 13 year old hookers. One too many bad guys let go by a system that seems to have forgotten all about the victim. [sighing] Some guys learn to turn their feelings off and they get hard. Or cynical, like our friend Bauman. I could never manage to do that. So I drank a bit. - But it's a cheat, Joe. You don't need it. You do not need it. You're a hell of a cop. You can make the system work. - Maybe you can, pard. It's getting a little late for me. - Well, if you believe that then you really are an asshole. [knocking] That's probably your breakfast. Hope you don't mind I took the liberty. [sighing] Oh great, come on in. Right there's fine. Thank you. Joe, my plane leaves in an hour so I'm gonna go but the place is yours. Take a shower, freshen up. Checkout time is 12 noon. - Hey really, I appreciate. - Hey, hey, are we partners? - You bet. - Bon appetit. [ominous music] I'll send Debbie on without me. - Mr. Mosley. - Oh, Mr. Saint John, please come in. - Thank you. I wanted to return these prints to you personally. - You'll show my work at your gallery? - I'm very sorry. I discussed the shots with Jeff. He feels your technique is well above average, however your choice of subject matter is cliche. - It's nature, the planet earth. How can that be cliche? - It's just one opinion. Perhaps another dealer will see things differently. - Bullshit! You people are all alike. Jealous parasites! Who are you anyway to judge me?! What have you ever done? Nothing but take money from the talent of others. You wouldn't know real art if it crawled up and bit you in the ass! - Jeff told me I should just mail these back. But I want to give you the courtesy of a personal reply. Seems I was wrong! [bashing] - Damn right you were, you slimy little faggot! [Mr. Saint John screaming] [laughing maniacally] - Bet you couldn't believe it. Bust the bastard for murder, he walks and he's still playing games with us. - We're gonna get him this time, Joe and this time he's not gonna get away. - When you try to sell the movie rights to this case, I want it in my contract, I get to play myself. - You got something. - Also on my contract, I want script approval of all my lines. - Must be good. - Try fibers. - [Elliot] Hair? - Nylon, brown, under the fingernails. - Meaning? - Meaning you match these to say, the rug in Mosley's car, then you might have yourself a new case. - Dafonzo, Dafonzo. [ominous music] K, Kathy. 2217 Lamasium. - Our ME found brown nylon fibers underneath the victim's fingernails. Now Mosely wears a toupe, brown, probably nylon. What this warrant will allow us to do is search his apartment and verify that the fibers are in fact his. - You have personally seen this toupee? - I have, your honor. - So have I, sir. It's embarrassing. - All right. You've got your warrant. And this time, I hope you crucify this son of a bitch. - Thank you sir. [active music] - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry Kathy, I didn't mean to scare you. I tried the bell. Heard the music, door was open. - What do you want? - [Mosley] I got a job for you. - I told you to call my agent. - Its swimwear. Job pays a thousand dollars. But we got to leave right away. - Look, I'm a little busy, you're just gonna have to leave. - Oh well I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist. - All right. What am I supposed to bring? - I have a bathing suit for you ready. - Is it all right if I change in there? - Whatever makes you comfortable. - Here. You shall need this too. Hurry up, we don't wanna lose light. [buzzing] - With any luck at all, you'll make that four o'clock to Maui. - Looks like he changed the lock. - Bad investment. [bashing] [urgent music] - Oh God. - This one's on Durkee's hands. [beeping] - [Man] Los Angeles Police Department. - Dafonzo here, yeah. Put me through to homicide. - [Man] Please hold. - Oh sweet Jesus. [tense music] - Kathy, hi! Hey, got another job? - Yeah, this is, - Peter Gable, pleased to meet you. Now if you excuse us, we don't want to be late for our appointment. - Lori! - You make one more sound, it'll be the last one you'll ever hear. [phone ringing] - Okay, okay. Hello? - [Joe] Kathy? - No, this is Lori. - Lori, this is Kathy's father. Is my daughter there? - Uh, no I'm sorry. She just left on a job. - [Joe] You know where? - No I'm sorry I don't. - Look, Lori, I know Kathy probably told you to stonewall me if I called but this is an emergency, a police emergency. Now I want you to level with me, where is she? - Look, Mr. Davonzo, I really don't know. I'm telling you the truth. She left with this photographer, something Gable. - Right, now think carefully. Did she have anything with her that might indicate where she was going? - Well, yeah she was wearing a swimsuit and she had a beach towel. They were probably going to the beach but I couldn't tell you. - Lori? Lori? [ominous music] - [Mosley] Time to go to work. - I know this guy's a creature of habit. The question is where. - Well there's his only beach shot, Corona del Mar. - No, too public. He needs some place far out of the way. Here's water. Here. - [Elliot] What is it, White Cliffs Preserve. - Yeah that's only three minutes from here. - Well let's do it. - All right. - Hey! - Go! - Drop it! That's police property, you're under arrest! Dammit! [revving] [tires screeching] - They got our damn radio. Find a phone and give me a backup. - Covered, get out of here! [siren sounding] [honking] - [Man] Asshole! - Shit. Excuse me sir, I need to use your phone. This is a police emergency. Hey, you guys don't quit. You're under arrest. - Is that so? - That's right. [gun cocking] [gun firing] [shattering] [siren sounding] [tense music] - There, that's better isn't it? - Please don't kill me. - Kathy, don't beg. It demeans you. [siren sounding] [tires screeching] All right, pull your hair back. Lift it back. Come on Kathy, smile. Come on, enjoy it! - Oh god. Please, I can't. - Aw. You don't feel sexy, huh? Wow, we're gonna have to do something about that. Get you in the mood. Take your top off. - No! - [Mosley] Come on, don't be shy. You've done this before. I've seen you, remember? - No! - Kathy. You want me to do it? - No! [sobbing] [siren sounding] [tires screeching] - Cut! Lose it. Your hair is too symmetrical to make the political statement I want. - Okay, take 27 up. [tires screeching] - Hey watch, it! - Action. [crashing] Dammit, I didn't even get that on film! [crashing] - Captain? [sighing] - Any word on Greenfield? - He just went into surgery. - Was he able to say where Davonzo went? - Kid's still unconscious. - Damn. [siren sounding] [tense music] - That's it, beautiful. You're doing a wonderful job, whore. - Damn you, if you're gonna kill me, why don't you just do it?! - Murder is an art, darling. And I'm an artist. All of Los Angeles knows that by now. Including your father. - How can you just kill people? - People? You're not a person. Look at yourself. You're an animal. A piece of meat like all the other whores. [tense music] - Kathy! Kathy! [splashing] - Daddy! Daddy! - Oh, you want your Daddy, huh? But he's not coming? You know why? Oh ho, he asked me to kill you! Oh Kathy, he hates you. You are a whore, he wants you dead! Drop the gun! In the water! [bashing] [splashing] [splashing] [bashing] [bashing] [gun firing] [groaning] [sobbing] - Easy. - Daddy. I'm so scared. [sobbing] - Thank you, baby. [light music] Hey Elliot. - Hmm, Joe. - Easy, easy. Doc says you need to rest. - Mosley. - Oh, he's history. The double sawbuck I owe you. - All right. Call it even, we're a day late. - Elliot, there's somebody very special I'd like you to meet. - Huh? - Elliot Greenfield, my daughter Kathy. - Hi, Elliot. - Hi, you're okay. - I'm okay. - You did good, Joe. - [Joe] Yeah. Back on your feet now. - Basically a slam dunk. - So you all right, Daddy? - I am now, darling.
