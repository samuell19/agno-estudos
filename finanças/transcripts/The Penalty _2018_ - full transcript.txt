Grab a heart balloon Get me another one, Nycole can you hold this? I miss her so much Careful with your fingers Shelby... The one that used to work here that got robbed and killed. Yeah, that was your daughter? Yeah Beautiful sister man Hopefully this will stay up here They made this her permanent store July 8th and she got robbed and killed July 20th. 12 days later When she used to work here and I came to see her, she was always cordial very friendly, kind and then when I heard about that situation, it really tore me up and I really hope that the dude that did it, I hope they give him the death penalty, really because, just to take somebody's life senselessly maybe I'm maybe wrong for saying this but when you do senseless murders what not eye for an eye let's get back to that take his ass out We love you Shelby I love you Shelby "This is Jacksonville 911, Smith" Yeah, there's a guy that just robbed the Metro PCS across from our store OK, was he black, white, Hispanic? Black guy "What color shirt and pants did he have on?" What color shirt and pants did he have on? He said he don't know, he just ran out the store whenever he came in there "Anyone see what kind of clothes he had on or if he had anything in his hands?" Do you know if he had a gun in his hands? Did you see the gun? He said he he saw the gun in his hand "Police say an armed man walked in to the store and demanded money from there witnesses ran out and that's when they heard gunshots the man took off running and hasn't been seen since." It was the lieutenant that came to my job and he didn't say nothing, he just stood there and I said "Lieutenant, it's Shelby isn't it?" I started punching the walls and then I just screamed "Sitting on the steps outside Police Headquarters, Darlene Farah is begging for answers knowing the killer is still on the loose." "By her side, her 16 year-old son, Caleb who says his sister was the sweetest person he'd ever known" Since Saturday, I've had 2 hours sleep I don't think you know that I can go to sleep for a whole night knowing that this man that killed my sister is still out. It killed me to put all of Shelby's stuff in storage I felt like I was just putting her away. The pastor went into the house and packed Shelby's stuff up I didn't even bring the furniture or nothing I mean we like completely started over All we had was the clothes on our back "We're learning new details about the killing of a Metro PCS employee who was murdered on the job this past Saturday evening. "Police say they've caught the man who did it' The Sherriff's office says he goes by the nickname... Killer 21 year old James Rhodes is charged with the murder of 20 year old Shelby Farah She got shot right here, in the chest in the wrist, in the thigh With a 40 caliber Glock and every bullet exited. The video shows she was standing up and then she collapsed to her knees She was reaching for the phone She fought for a little over 20 minutes before she died I think about that every day, was she reaching for the phone to call me? You know. what... Oh god. Darlene Farah struggled to take even a few steps to her daughter's vigil She says tonight the pain of Shelby's loss is real. I'm going to make sure if it takes the last breath in my body He needs to get the death penalty. We begin tonight's show with a look at the chaos surrounding executions in the United States Now that many of the drugs used for lethal injections are no longer available The execution scarcity stems from the refusal of manufacturers in Europe and the United States To let them be used to put people to death. I think the job of defending the most unpopular amongst our society Is absolutely an indispensable part of our society. All of my clients have been tried, convicted and sentence to death In the Ohio state court system. Basically every execution that's been scheduled, going back to June 3rd of 2009 Billy Slagle, he ended up committing suicide 3 days before his execution Harry Mitts Jnr on September 25th was executed Ron Phillips was next on November 14th 2013 and he was reprieved. And that leads us to Dennis McGuire And after McGuire, 9, 10, 11, 12... 12 guys after McGuire all the way out to January 21st, 2016. Well the attorneys for an Ohio inmate scheduled to die through an experimental execution method Say that their client will suffer a terrifying and agonizing death. According to his lawyers, the untested injection method will not properly sedate McGuire Which will cause him to feel the pain of suffocation before he dies. Dennis McGuire is on death row for the 1989 rape and murder of pregnant woman Joy Stewart. The state is planning to inject him with a 2-drug mix that's never been used in an execution before. We've presented our case to the judge to stop the execution. We argue that Dennis will feel and be consciously aware of feeling like he is he is suffocating Because he IS suffocating because of the way the drugs work. So now we sit and wait, expecting a decision any time today Alright, here's the ruling, let's see what it is... Finding as moot, denying... Fuck Fuck Hello this is Debbie can I help you? Hi Debbie, this is Allen Bohnert from the Federal Public Defenders Office. Oh hi, how are you? Oh I've had better days. I bet you have, I'm sorry, I should not have just said that. Checking to see if ya'll decided to file a reply to that yet No, not that I'm aware of. I'm preparing for a worst case scenario. Right right. Are you kidding me, how am I doing? I'm doing great, I'm going to have a pulse on Friday. Nothing that they argued was unexpected you know, so we tried to address it preemptively I just got off the phone with Dennis and he knows. Although the court is not without concern over what could transpire during McGuire's execution the only fair evaluation of the evidence here leads to the conclusion that the degree of risk that Ohio's protocol presents is acceptable within the contours of the constitution. For the second year in a row, a record number of people convicted of crimes have been exonerated in the United States according to a new report by the national registry of exonerations. 149 people falsely convicted of crimes were freed in 2015. Nearly 40 percent of those cases were charged as homicides. Seems like you're overwhelmed, no words? Breaking news from WDSU. After spending 15 years in prison, a Jefferson Parish man is free DNA evidence exonerated Damon Thibodeaux who was on death row at Angola. serving a sentence for the rape and murder of his 14 years old cousin. His attorneys are speaking right now in the 7th ward, lets listen in live. You dream of it every day but it's not the same as actually going through it. It's a surreal walk, it's not something that you can prepare yourself for because you've been living in those conditions for so long. How do you feel now? Free Real Free Damon Thibodeaux, the man right there at the centre of your screen, free today. He spent 23 hours a day in solitary confinement during his 15 years at Angola Now 38 years old, he went to jail when he was about 23. If I had just gone off and done something else that day. Thoughts like that were running through my head every day for 15 years. Every day, that's what I would think about. 911 Operator 16, can I help you I need to get a cop to my house Ok what's the problem M'am? Our 14 year-old daughter's been missing for the last two and half hours and we can't find her nowhere. She's missing? Crystal had come up missing. Everybody was looking for her. She went to the store and she never came back They came to pick up Damon to take him in and question him And after that, he never came home For the record, can you state your full name? Damon Allen Thibodeaux. What time was that you last saw her? It was just after 5 Some people come walked over here a minute ago and they found a little girl dead by the river. Deputies found the Champagnes eldest daughter under the Huey P. Long Bridge last night strangled Authorities believe that she may have also been sexually assaulted. Her panties and her shorts are pulled down to her ankles her bra and her shirt is pulled up to her shoulders. Why? A parent's anguished cry, his 14 year-old daughter is dead, brutally murdered If that reality isn't horrible enough, the family must now cope with the fact that a relative is to blame. 22 year-old Damon Thibodeaux, Crystal's step-cousin has confessed to the crime You wrapped the wire around her neck twice? Yes They walked in to the courtroom and made it sound like I just walked in to this interrogation room and spilled my guts. I used to be one of those people who believed that someone would never confess to something they didn't do and society as a whole believes that but yet here I am, here I sit. We'll go on the record, we're here in the case of the state of Florida vs James Rhodes It's case 2013 - CF 6932 the defendant is present with his attorneys as is counsel for the state are both sides ready to proceed? Yes your Honor Gregory Pritchard Please Ok we can tentatively schedule this matter for continuation of this hearing for April 28th at 2.30pm Oh god Are you ok? Oh god, he's just sitting there smiling. Smiling like it ain't nothing. He gonna smile, he gonna... oh jesus. What do you think when you see him each time you come back to court? It takes a lot out of me when I see him but I can't be angry cause angry's not going to bring Shelby back. I want to put structure and stability back in to my other kids's life. You saw what happened today and before the court hearings were a month apart or 2 months apart we were in court every week for months. Thank you Darlene Thank you, appreciate your time. I got to smoke, I'm ready to smoke a cigarette My nerves is, my nerves is like zzzzzzz A Duval County Judge delayed a decision today on whether accused killer Jame Rhodes is intellectually disabled. It's because the defense's expert witness was not available. I'm so disappointed. Another month, can you believe that? Same stuff. This is it, this is my life. It's crazy. We've been to court so many times in the last few months, I haven't really had time to really grieve over my daughters death. You know, victim's families go through a terrible ordeal. Most of the time, the victim's families, they are very much in favour of the death penalty. There are some people that because of what they did have given up on the right to live amongst us and that is our philosophy. You know I've been doing this a long time, I think my first death penalty case was in 1988 and none of those people have been executed. That's the unfortunate thing in our system, that it takes too long. I don't think there's enough focus on victims' families, you know in terms of closure. At some point these families deserve closure don't they? It'll say Farah right here, the base I want her to have her own mom. You can't, where she's buried at. That's why you shouldn't have buried her right there. That was the only space available son, I buried her where she wanted to be buried. It'll be 2 hearts, she will be on 1 heart and whoever is buried next to her will be on the other heart But I'm saying, with the angels it's ok? You want it in the black Black Mom ok, I don't want to see no more of this stuff. I know Bye, get out with that, get out, I don't want to see it Alright bro, I don't want to see it damn, stop That color or the black Black, I already said it, stop asking me. What's up bro? No not yet bro, we're just um... my mom is here picking out Shelby's tombstone now You know you don't never think about picking out a tombstone for your... for your... for your sibling. The day before she died, we had a really big fight We shared a room and Caleb wasn't home that night So she took her sheets and put them on Caleb's bed and stayed in Caleb's room And then the next morning she went to work and I didn't get to see her and she kept trying to apologise the next day. She was texting me the whole day and calling me and everything and I was ignoring her and I was thinking like what if she knew that something was about to happen to her What if she was calling me because she was scared. I kind of felt like it was my fault. We were always so close with each other and the happiest family you would ever see. Like, we argued but not like we do now. I don't know, it's just he hurt a lot of people by taking one life. As the state of Ohio prepares to use a new two drug method of lethal injection for the first time for Dennis McGuire's execution. His attorneys argued this week that he would suffer from a condition known as air hunger. McGuire's attorney unsuccessfully challenged the 2-drug protocol in federal court this week. What we think is going to happen is he's going to start to obstruct right away. Looking for his head coming up, not just side to side, but up. There may be vomiting. If he's not going to be able to breath, he's going to be trying to move, he's going to be trying to clear the obstruction. I mean seizures is one of the things that's been mentioned I don't remember if there's a strap across the head You should be able to see the muscles tensing and releasing, tensing and releasing I mean it's more than one doctor who thinks it's quite possible that he's still going to be alive at that 5-minute mark. Um.... ok Are you trying to get yourself beaned in the head? This is stress relief It's a job that is thankless and it's not very popular. And I know how many hours he spends to not be very popular. When there's an execution, it's toxic. I worry about him, I support the important job that he's doing and I know that he puts his whole heart and soul in to it. I don't know that I want him in it for the rest of our lives because of the stress and the toll that it takes on him and us So honestly if tomorrow it could be abolished in Ohio that would be the best thing possible because then he wouldn't have to choose. It would just be taken away Not just in Ohio but all over the country, we have states that are just kind of... I don't know how else to put it, they're experimenting on our clients. The immediate focus is.. don't torture my client if you're going to kill him. When Damon came out, he spent the first 5 or 6 weeks living with my wife and me in Minneapolis and went to work doing mail delivery at our office. We helped him deal with getting back on the grid he had no driver's licence, he had no ID apart from the one from death row. Good people here. I like my job I became absolutely convinced of Damon's innocence after about 4 hours work on the case. If you read the autopsy report, you knew right away that what Damon had confessed to was completely false. How I became a suspect I really don't know At a news conference this afternoon, Sherrif Harry Lee said Thibodeaux wasn't a suspect at first because he seemed to have an alibi. He was helping Crystal's parents search for her when she turned up missing Friday night. He was at the house when the mother and father said she wasn't there so that's what kind of threw us off, cause he was actually looking for her. He was actually one of the ones handing out pamphlets. I was looking for her for 36 hours. I had just laid down to go to sleep, the detectives knocked on my door, said they wanted to ask some questions about Crystal. At first, I thought it was just a routine thing. What's the relationship like between yourself and her? I would see her as a sister When Jefferson Parish Deputies made the grim discovery It turned out the man they would accuse of the crime was already being questioned by detectives. You're aware that we have now found the body of Crystal? Yes sir The police use what's called the Reid Technique. It's designed to elicit a confession Are you involved in any way to aid and assist in causing the death of Crystal? No sir, I am not. Your reply if you were asked to take a polygraph? I would They're allowed to manipulate you, threaten you, lie to you. I was told I'd failed a polygraph, my witnesses weren't vouching for me. They explained in detail, how someone's executed. It's now 4.21 am. Tell me what happened Did you pick her up? She got in your car? What happened? After having no sleep for 36 hours and getting dragged in for a 9-hour interrogation like that it's a nightmare. How many times did you hit her? What did you hit her with? Did you look at her face? Was she gasping for air? And when you break you'll tell them whatever they want to hear. And I... I would have, I'd have told them anything they wanted me to tell them. You squeezed her neck? I didn't think I was squeezing it that hard Did you ejaculate inside of her or outside of her? I think it might have been both Do you remember having to put something else around her throat? I had a wire or something Do you remember the colour? White. No red wires? When you put the wire around her neck, did you have it tight? Yes How tight? Until she couldn't breathe. Why wasn't I a little stronger? Why couldn't I just keep telling them, look I didn't do it, I didn't do it. I was their target and that was it. They found an easy target and they got it. You know nobody's ever apologised to Damon and nobody has ever recognised the wrong that was done to him. He became the 300th person exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence in the US, the 18th death row inmate saved from execution His release continues a flurry of recent exonerations. In California, John Edward Smith was released 19 years after his wrongful murder conviction for a drive by shooting. He hasn't touched his sister in 31 years! Thank you Jesus! 30 years on death row, Glenn Ford walked out of a Louisiana prison a free man In the past 2 months, 2 others in Chicago and Texas were absolved for rape and murder thanks to DNA analysis. A combined total of over 300 years innocent and on death row. Like Thibodeaux, a quarter of those wrongfully convicted had given false confessions and admissions Often under pressure from the police to do so Decades of evidence show capital punishment depends more on the color of someone's skin than the crime that they were convicted of. This is as I see it, the biggest civil rights violation in our time in our state. I've been a police officer for 31 years, these are the worst crimes and these people deserve the death penalty. The public spectacle of executions is as far from grieving and peace that one can get And my heart goes out to other victims' families every single time an execution is announced in this country. There is nowhere that we can go to escape that killer's name and it's the state that does it to us This is not what we want. We want funded counseling services, we want support, we want to put our lives back together and we want to do it in peace. Nobody knows unless you've been through it yourself Trust me, a death penalty case is a lot different than just a regular murder case. I've learned that. I mean it's year after year after year going through different appeals. Why put a family through the suffering of having to re-live that for the next 20 years. I'm 50 years old, 20 years from now I'll be 70. I might not even be alive, I won't be alive to see justice served for my daughter. Farah says while she appreciates the states hard work in going for the worst punishment, she just wants everything to be over. After a court hearing in February, the prosecutor and defense attorney walked up to us and said that James Rhodes was wanting to put an offer on the table where he would change a plea of not guilty to guilty. For life in prison, no eligibility of parole. They flat out told us, we would have one more court hearing, it would be done, over with, when we walked out.. that's it. If they take his offer that he put on the table, we won't have to go through all the appeals. He'll spend the rest of his life in prison without parole. I mean I want justice served, he committed the crime, he committed the murder. He needs to suffer the consequences, but I don't feel like killing him is... that's not going to bring my daughter back. I just want them to take the offer so we can try to move on with our life. I need to know from you all, do you want them to take his offer? cause this is a family thing. I want him to die. I don't think he should get the death penalty, cause there's no sense in killing somebody else. Alright, I don't even want to talk about this. But I need to know, in case... it's a family thing I don't. Mom, at the end of the day, nothing is going to matter what we say anyway. Do you want them to take his offer or do you want it to go to trial? I don't care. So now you don't care? OK, so whatever happens, it happens. -Yeah Yeah Okie Dokey I'll be in my car I love you... I love you I love you too A condemned Prebble county killer has just hours left to live. The execution is making national headlines, McGuire will be put to death using a combination of drugs never before used in the US for this purpose Well this new drug combination was originally designed as a back up for pentobarbital which Ohio has used until now. We are outside the southern Ohio correctional facility in Lucasville for the execution of 53 year-old Dennis McGuire. In 1989, he kidnapped, raped and murdered 22 year-old Joy Stewart, at the time she was 8 months pregnant. Stay with 2 news for coverage of the execution here in Lucasville. Convicted Killer Dennis McGuire spent the final moments of his life gasping for breath as the state of Ohio for the first time, used an untried 2-drug method of lethal injection. He reportedly gasped and snorted during the 26 minutes for the drugs to kill him. It was the longest execution by lethal injection in US history. Longtime witnesses to executions were stunned. He gasped deeply, it was kind of a rattling, guttural sound, there was kind of a snorting through his nose. A couple of times he definitely appeared to be choking. At this point it is entirely premature to consider this execution protocol anything other than a failed, agonizing experiment by the state of Ohio. The people of the state of Ohio should be appalled at what was done here today in their names. Unbelievable! Except not unbelievable, because that's exactly what we told them was gonna fucking happen. I don't know what this means going forward. Maybe the governor is rightly appalled at what just happened and decides that he's going to start reprieving sentences? I don't know. The only failure is you as a lawyer, weren't by his aside. Attached to him for supporting a lying, murdering cunt. So you should perish the same way. Typical lawyer scum. Hello, this is Allen how can I help you? Hi, this is Tracy from NBC news Hello this is Allen This is Mark Covak from 6 newspapers and the Youngstown Indicator. I'm a producer with Fox News Channel. I just wanted to get your general reaction. The results are in at the experiment was a fail. I think what we're talking about is exactly what we argued. Dennis McGuire was going to suffocate to death and that was going to be terrifying and horrifying for him to experience. Present today is Amber McGuire, the daughter and Dennis, the son. They are now in a sense victims as well. The agony and terror of watching my Dad suffocate to death lasted more than 19 minutes. I know what cruel and unusual punishment is, I witnessed it. Carole Avery, Joy's sister said she knows her sister suffered terror and pain when she was raped, sodomized, choked and killed by Dennis McGuire. She says he was treated more humanely today than her sister was treated and it was time for him to face his judgment. Would you expect the state might put a hold on using this method? I would hope. In our press release, we did call on Governor Kasich to implement a moratorium on executions. There are going to be people that say someone being put to death, it shouldn't be a painless type of thing. He spent 24 years in prison and he paid his time. He shouldn't have had to go that way he shouldn't be tortured to death. Ohioans need to understand that the death penalty is carried out in the name of every single citizen of the state of Ohio. We're all culpable. You have 7 new messages. You said the state of Ohio should be appalled by what was done in their names. It's frankly appalling that you'd say something remotely to those remarks. You've kind of lost your mind. Me and my mom, we actually disagreed and I actually didn't talk to her for like 3 or 4 days cause I felt like she was feeling sorry for him wanting to take his offer of life. But I didn't understand that it would be over. The state attorney's office are saying James Rhodes should be put to death for what he did. Am I saying that I don't feel that way? No, because I do feel that way. But at the same time, it's pretty overwhelming. It's been dragged out for almost 2 years, whether he gets death penalty or life, or 150 years as long as I know that the person responsible for taking my sisters life will never roam the streets again then it doesn't really matter. Cause he's gonna die one day anyway. James Rhodes was a child of the system, abandoned by his parents, sexually abused in a boys home. Rhodes is said to have an IQ of 67, possibly making him ineligible for the death penalty. Again, if a judge finds him intellectually disabled, he will not face the death penalty. We haven't even been to trial yet, and we've been on this one motion for a year and a half. We all are hoping the judge will say he's intellectually disabled cause he won't be eligible for the death penalty then maybe the state attorney's office will take his offer. Like a million bucks. You look handsome. Eew why are you smoking in here? Cause I'm in my bathroom. Yeah but cigarettes This is my area. That means you're too close Oh Nycole, look at the rainbow. Oh that's my baby. We're gonna be ok. Alors, bonjour. Alright, good morning. We're here for a ruling on a motion today following a 3 day hearing that we held on defendant's motion for determination of intellectual disability in regards to execution. I find that although the defendant does suffer from sub-average intelligence, intellectual ability but does not suffer from deficits of adaptive functioning or behavior as a result thereof. Therefore the defendant's motion is denied and the death penalty will remain as a possible sentence herein. Thank you your Honor Thank you Nah, everybody thinks that's a good thing, but that ain't no good thing. That ain't no good thing bro. Maybe they won't do it. Ok? Ok? Think about it like that, alright Oh god You know that this means that the state can seek the death penalty now. And they're going to. I know And um, you know... is that microphone still running? I'll cover it Don't nobody ask me how I'm doing bro. Everybody's always like how's your mom, or how's Nycole. Nah bro, ask me how I'm doing cause I'm not doing fucking good at all bro. All this shit for 2 years was dumb as fuck bro cause it's just been dragged out for no reason. Everything bro, now everything is back at square one. Two years later bro. Two years later I don't get it bro, for real I don't get it. Did you ever actually consider it? Getting to the death house? You have to. You have to come face to face with your own mortality. I can't speak for these guys but for me, it was facing the fact that one day they may come take me, lay me on that table stick a needle in my arm and shut down my organs one by one. You know I've survived my first year, done quite a bit I'm told. Trying not to loose control of things I guess. Cause everything happens quick. This is the first speaking tour I've done. I just hope I communicate to the audiences how important this is. But every time we do this, we have to relive what we went through. I spent 15 years locked in a cell for 23 hours a day in what was one the most bloodiest prison in the country. I had visits from my family maybe 5 times in the 15 years that I was there. Every day I would do the same thing, it was the same monotonous thing, I'd wake up, make coffee, read my bible, prepare for the day... same thing. I saw sunshine 3 hours a week. You sit there and you wait to die. I've literally watched men go insane, sitting in that cell. In the particular prison I was in, the state allowed tours. People like you would pay to come tour death row like a zoo. Is there some anger? Yes there is. But I believe that it's better served in putting my life back together. After having only been out for just over a year, I sometimes feel like the madhatter in wonderland so it's still very much a dream to me at times. Ah nice There was a quote, you can release a man from prison but you can't release him from the grave. Uh well look at it this way, would you rather be stalked by someone with a camera or an inmate with a shank? Camera every time How many more exonerations is it going to take before we as a society realize that this is not working and we actually do something about it? I sit here and I look at all these young faces and I see registered voters that will one day sit on a jury. One day you may be presented with cases like ours. You don't have to be sheep. You can change this! Thank you Hello love - Hello How are you? - How are you? I'm good -I'm good See, we're just so good for each other How are you? How's the tour going? It's it's going good. I am involved with a lady friend at the moment, she lives in California, I live in Minnesota so there's a distance there, but we get to know each other and we talk. It's not easy making new friends after something like this, cause "what did you do before you came here?", "where did you work before you came here?", "where did you live?" Well, death row. They don't know what to do with that, you know they're like uuuuuugh It's just one of those situations where you have to realize that not everyone out here is out to ruin your life. There are some that are actually interested in knowing you and helping you. I'll talk to you later I'll talk to you later. Love you bye! I love you too! The state of Ohio says that the new drug cocktail used to execute Dennis McGuire in January worked correctly. But it's increasing the dosage of the sedative painkiller cocktail for future executions. His family claims that the state used McGuire as an experiment, but the state says McGuire was killed humanely. Their official position is that nothing went wrong with McGuire. They created a report of sorts. Basically says that everything was constitutional, Dennis was unconscious the whole time, so he didn't experience anything. You know because they're all medically qualified to opine on that you see. I don't know yet what we're going to have to do when executions resume, and it's not clear when that's going to be. Oh get up, get it, get it, get it, get it. Don't get yours dirty babe. You gotta angle it. Why? Is that rain? It might be coming. Is that funny to you Pearsen? This afternoon, the legislature actually pushed through legislation that would try to pull a curtain over the information about who was involved in any of this stuff. You know the state is going to fight tooth and nail to try and keep that information secret. The idea that we could just hide lawlessness is just so antithetical to what a democracy should be. Regardless of how people feel about the death penalty, what the legislature is doing with this secrecy stuff should just piss people off. We'd like to call Miss Darlene Farah. Alright Miss Farah, come forward to be sworn in. Do you solemnly swear all the following testimony that you give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god? I do Mrs Farah, what's your position on the death penalty in this case? Objection... irrelevance Your honor, the court has already ruled on this issue in that it's irrelevant whether a victim's family member is pro death penalty or against the death penalty. That's inadmissible at trial. We respectfully request the court to rule that this is irrelevant Killing Mr Rhodes is not going to bring my daughter back and I'm holding on tight to my other two children's life and I don't like to see them going through this. The murder of your lovely daughter, did it forever change your life and forever change your other daughter's life? Of course And your son's life and did it forever change the relationship that you have with those 2 kids. Of course Ok But it's gotten worse. When if this would be over with and the state would accept the offer, we could focus on getting it all back together. That's the point I'm trying to stress to you. I don't care about James Rhodes, I don't care about the public defender's office, I don't care about the state attorney's office. The only thing I care about is Caleb Farah and Nycole Farah. I shouldn't have to be sitting up here going through what I'm going through. I feel like you're attacking me, we're supposed to be on the same side here. This is not about me, this is about Shelby Farah, the victim. Has everybody forgotten about the victim? We are doing what we feel is appropriate based on the facts and the law and that's all we can rely on. Nevertheless we are sympathetic to a victim's family, you have to be. But it's at your discretion if you want to pursue the death penalty or not. There's no law that says you have to pursue it. The law says that based on certain facts, you factor in the aggravators and mitigators and then you factor in the facts. He knows what he did is wrong, he's not arguing that he didn't do it. He's ready to go do his time. He's been ready for over two years. Yeah over two years, it was six months when you guys first came up to us and told us about the offer. It's just all been so unnecessary. You know the state gets to pick and choose which cases they seek death on. Yeah The state attorney holds the power in their fingers to make this go away tomorrow. They could put him on the calendar, do the plea and it's done. Did he ever say why he did it or no? Do you think he would? Not really. I want to buy him a bible I want to ask God to forgive him, even though I probably will never forgive him but I want to ask God to forgive him. Only 16 counties in the country imposed 5 or more death sentences between 2010 and 2015 and 4 of them, right here in Florida. That's according to Harvard Law School's Fair Punishment Project The report calls Angela Corey and Bernie De La Rionda overly aggressive prosecutors. Angela Corey is the chief state attorney here, she has the final say so over everything. And Bernie is like her right hand man. ....and all victims of crime. But as long as they know that there will be prosecutors fighting for the truth, I think that victims will continue to rely on this justice system. The stubbornness that's in me, it's like I refuse to allow her to get a gain over my daughter's death. Now that she's running for office and all of this political stuff has started she needs to know that people are supporting me are not going to support her. This could hurt. By her not taking the offer it could hurt her campaign, which it is. In a month it will make 3 years since Shelby was murdered but I knew that I had to find it in my heart to forgive this person that took my daughter's life away. For my sake, for my health. Eventually, I don't think it will get easier but it will get more bearable. But as far as the bullshit that I've been through with the state attorney's office, I'll never get over that shit. Every day I try to remind myself, look this is a gift. It's not the glamour job like people think it is, but if you have the mindset for it, it's the best job in the world. I've seen the country pretty much from the cab of this truck. If I'm going to have to work the rest of my life, then I'm going to do something I like doing. I don't see this as a cell, I see it as an office with a couch in it. The Rockies, when you're driving over them you get to see the moisture fly across the tip of the mountain and turn in to clouds. You get to see miles and miles of terrain that's just grazing farmland you know. I do have a lawsuit going against the state, but kind of like my trial there's really not much I can do about it you know. All I can do now is wait and see what's going to happen with this. I am hoping that I can get some compensation, something to retire with you know. Let's face it there's not much in social security for me, I mean I'll be 41 Sunday. So I'm going to be working for a very long time. Alright big shooter, you ready bubba? Bye bye racers You going to go around and circle back up here alright? Turn! The Ohio Prisons Department announced today that the state is putting off executions. The reason is the state's problems with getting a hold of lethal injection drugs. For 2015 nobody is going to die in Ohio at the hands of the executioners and if you would have told me that two or three years ago when I was staring at the execution schedule that was every 60 days, I'd have been like "you're crazy". You figured that out already. Alrighty you ready? The changes that have been made to the execution schedule. It's meant that I have a little bit more time with my family And right now that's been pretty invaluable. Hey booboo. Hi. She arrived on January 27th, so about a week early. To know kind of, well this is where we are in Ohio, yeah I know sometimes it makes me want to throw up too. I know I know. It was nice, this was the first delivery where he was not somewhere else both mentally and physically. Not worrying about work or impending executions, so it's a nice break. Although I have to object, I was physically at both of the other births. Ugh, you were doing paperwork But I was there physically present Yeah but mom was walking me around the hospital while you were working Right, but I was there. Not with me. Aah, debatable. Oh, he saw it! 2015 will see the lowest number of executions nationally. And really what you're left with is a small outlier number of states that are doing it. It only exists on the fringes. It only exists because a handful of prosecutors in this country continue to push it. And that's it. This is an election 2016 special, the state attorney debate. For the first time in 8 years, Northeast Florida voters are getting ready to make a choice about the area's top prosecutor. The incumbent, State Attorney Angela Corey has gained national attention prosecuting several high profile cases which have also made her a lightning rod for criticism. Now 2 of her former prosecutors are challenging her saying it's time for a change. Tonight all three make their case. Good evening and welcome to the 2016 state attorney debate. Florida's primary two weeks away and that's when registered republicans will make their choice in the primary in this contested race. And now let's welcome our three republican candidates for state attorney to our stage. And in alphabetical order, they are Angela Corey, Melissa Nelson and Wes White Duval County leads the state of Florida in murders, we are 56 percent more likely to have violent crime in this community than across the nation. Unfortunately over the last 8 years, the decisions, rhetoric and explanations of Angela Corey have eroded our community's confidence in our justice system. I will not apologize for being tough on the violent criminals that are preying on this community. Through being tough on them, we have sent more people to state prison and put more people on death row, than any other circuit in the state of Florida when you combine those 2 things. Do you think that if Melissa Nelson won, she'd respect your wishes? I think that she'd be fair and take in to consideration the family's wishes. I support her 100 percent, I hope she wins. I have a deep respect for the criminal justice system and I believe it's time for a change... and my message is resonating with the community. It's exciting. Yeah it's exciting. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We must choose life over death all of the time, not just some of the time. The death penalty in Duval county needs to be suspended immediately. In Jesus' name we pray, and all of God's children say Amen. Amen! Thou shall not kill, thou shall not kill, thou shall not kill. Did you hear Angela Corey's comments this morning on the radio? I was kind of shocked. No to be honest with you, I was out of town, I drove to town, I left after court on Monday. Something along the lines of you caring more about publicity than justice. I can't believe she said that. I'm fighting for what I think is right, and as far as these political comments that she's making, Angela Corey made it political when she refused to take his offer. Oh that just upsets me, what else did she say? It is a constitutional duty to consult with the victim, but the victim does not tell the state attorney what punishment would be imposed in any case. We give their feeling great weight, and we have done that with the very vocal Darlene Farah who appears to be more interested in publicity than actually grieving for her daughter. Why stir that case up, that case is still pending. Are you really fucking serious? As we do in every single case, why has that case been plucked out? We talked to Corey after she made the comments on the radio, she stands behind what she said. Cause we have so many victims who have suffered just as much as Mrs. Farah, who sit quietly and wait for justice, trusting us to follow the law. You don't do stuff like that. How can she say something like that? Nobody understands like. Nobody understands what we feel unless you're in the situation. Straight up like nobody can tell me how I feel. She done got the right one this time! I don't want to sit behind the glass. Me neither. Yeah you want to feel the wind you know. I'm going to pull down your beanie every time it goes up cause you look like a... hoodlum. Yeah. Yeah I can't afford to look like a hoodlum. There you go... No. I didn't really expect to have much of a romantic life, considering what I've been through, cause people are judgmental. I went to Georgia for a conference gathering, I saw her there and I was like ok I've got to talk to her. We start talking and we've been talking ever since. That was fabulous man. You had fun? Yeah I liked that. Oh I got a really nice picture of you. Or I think it's nice. Let's see what Facebook says... I'm sure Facebook will like it. We connected right off the bat. We connected right off the bat. Which is nice cause you don't really find that with people. You don't, you really don't. For our first year anniversary, I was like where do you want to go, I have a week off? And I was wanted to bring you out this way, it's super pretty out here. And this is about as close to Alcatraz as I wanna get! Yes, don't worry we don't have to go there! Unfortunately my dad doesn't like the fact that he's been in prison despite his innocence, it's like something I have to keep quiet about. What's your name? His name's Damon. And there it is! They never spell my name right, my name is Veronika, but with a K I'll take this one. We're both pretty independent people and I know that you're rebuilding your life and I respect that. She makes it better every day so, I like that Aw sweet. The headline of the article is "State Attorneys challenging former death row inmate's request for wrongful conviction compensation" He must affirmatively prove by clear and convincing evidence that he did not commit the crime or any other crime based on the same set of facts. What other crime am I supposed to have committed? What a bunch of jackasses man. Yeah that's obnoxious. I just don't get it man, that's ridiculous. It's really sad, because now I mean... it doesn't matter who it is, it doesn't matter what evidence there is, they're always going to make the exoneree fight. Yeah. It doesn't matter who it is, it doesn't matter how clear, They don't want to admit that they're wrong. It's never going to be clear and convincing to them. Does it really hurt them that much to say look, we got the wrong guy? It's Florida primary day in election 2016. Thousands of voters head to the polls to cast their ballots in several key races that will decide the future of our country. If you haven't yet, go vote. Polls close tonight at 7 o'clock, you've got a little more than an hour to head to your closest precinct. Voter turnout right now is low, about 24 percent. Parts of Florida's gulf coast bracing for a possible hurricane, it's not a hurricane just yet. And we're beginning now with the very latest of tracking the tropics with meteorologist Tim. You have just a few minutes before the polls close, remember as long as you are in line by 7 o'clock tonight, you can cast your vote in today's primary. Bernie's gone if Angela Corey loses right? I would imagine, I don't know. I hope so, cause I'll be double dancing. Polls closing, a lot of excitement, we're just minutes away from knowing more about election 2016. I just pray to God we have a new prosecutor. Hopefully who wins will have more respect for victim's families and treat them better. And it's not just happening to my family. This was last updated 10 minutes ago. This is Channel 4. Woo hoo! She won it, Angela Corey just conceded. Angela Corey conceded, Melissa Nelson won. Yes! Oh my God! Oh my God, the hairs on my arms are standing up. Oh my God! Here it is, breaking news, can you turn it up? Go ahead, cry girlfriend cause I'm about to. Oh wow I want you to know something, democrat, republican, independent, black, white, rich or poor, I'm committed to serving all of you in this community equally. And tonight, this victory gives voice to what our community expects from our justice system. Angela Corey, now the first state attorney here in Jacksonville in modern history to lose a re-election bid. Yeah buddy! Caleb, Miss Billard said holy shit I can't believe it! Oh shit! Executions will resume in early 2017 using a new 3-drug combination. The Ohio department of corrections has not put anyone to death since 2014, when condemned prisoner Dennis McGuire gasped and snorted repeatedly during a 26-minute procedure. This is insanity. We just got word that they want to start back up with executions again with a new protocol. The state's scheduled about 33 new executions between now and the end of 2020. It's just groundhog day. You know, if an individual killed this many people, they'd go down as one of the biggest serial killers in history. The secrecy bill still remains in place and we're told that the state is going to be using a new execution protocol. They're going to use one of the drugs that was used to kill McGuire, a paralytic and then potassium chloride. A protocol that frankly is significantly more dangerous and more risky for the clients. You've only got a small handful of states here that are still actively killing people. Florida, Texas, Alabama, Georgia. The fact that Ohio wants to start killing people again, you know that doesn't change what actually is happening big picture wise. I mean ultimately one of these guys will be the last person to die under this policy. I'm reminded of John Kerry's statement as far as the Vietnam war: Who's going to be the last person to die for a mistake? Right? Somebody's going to be last. I'm hoping that whoever is last is on this list. We're all out of blue. How has the McGuire execution changed you? Sorry, um... In some respects I guess it's kind of further strengthened my resolve on doing this work, and at least seeing this endeavour through. I'll put these, I'll put four, it should be fine. You have the strength, you can rip it. You don't need scissors. Do you know how long I went without using sharp objects? Alright, you ready? Yeah. We're going to go to Los Angeles ,where my family lives and we're going to move in with my parents and I'm going to be going to school. I think after 2 years long distance, you start to realize you have to be in the same place. He says he's not making a big sacrifice, but I think he's making a big sacrifice, moving to a new place and moving away from basically the people that he's been surrounded by and who have been so supportive of him. I parked right in behind your moving vehicle, and I thought God I guess they really are leaving and Pam says it's like in an hour or two, you're having lunch and get on the road. Yeah. And hopefully you'll be... she'll be a little bit taller next time you see her. You'll be up here. So tall. This is where I put my life back together you know. A lot of good people here that helped me and a lot of good memories. I'm going to miss this place. But there's another chapter to be written. We can't all read the same story over and over again in our life you know. Oh good luck! Thank you. He's all grown up Steve! It's nerve wrecking moving halfway across the country, but it would feel wrong to not live my life after fighting so hard to get it back. I've got the keys to my own door. You know they don't lock the door behind me, I do. You know I unlock it, I lock it. Bye. Take care. Love you. Thank you for coming everyone. On the matter of the State of Florida vs James Rhodes, case number 2013 CF6932. Good morning your Honor, Debra Billard with the public defenders office on behalf of James Rhodes. Your Honor at this time we have an announcement to make to the court. OK. Your Honor, pursuant to negotiations with the state, Mr. Rhodes has authorized me to withdraw his previously entered pleas of not guilty and plead guilty to counts 1 through 4 of the indictment. With that said, state are you now formally withdrawing your notice of intent to seek the death penalty? That is correct, the state is withdrawing its intent to seek the death penalty, contingent on the entrance of this plea today. Are you entering this plea Mr. Rhodes freely, willingly and voluntarily? Yes your Honor. And are you entering this plea because indeed you are guilty of committing these 4 offences? Yes your honor. This is Shelby, my beautiful daughter that I raised. I brought in to this world and you took her out of this world. And when you took Shelby away from me, you didn't just take away one child from me, you took away all three of my children. As a mother, the pain that you've caused my son and my daughter, it just keeps ripping me apart. That pain will be there the rest of our life. I had to come in to the courtroom for almost 4 years. 3 years and 7 months. I have waited for this day for a long time, to where I don't have to come back to court and face the person that took my child's life away. But I know that when I walk out of that courtroom it's over. Mr. Rhodes I am going to accept your pleas of guilty, on counts 1 through 4 of the indictment. As for count 1, murder in the first degree, I'll sentence you to a term of life in prison without the possibility of parole, with a minimum mandatory sentence of life under Florida's 10 20 life statute. It's over. It's over. And so let me apologize to you for the ordeal you endured. Thank you sir. and to have the courage to speak out about it, because that cannot be easy to do.
