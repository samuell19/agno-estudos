I wasn't even eighteen yet when I came here with Kuya and his friends. I just went with Kuya because Mama didn't want him to take a vacation without me accompanying him. Little did I know that in our short stay here in Sto. Tomas, I would be able to experience a lot of things that would be very, very hard to forget. Martin! Yes? You left this. It's been ringing for a while now. Might be your mom. Hello, Ma? What did Mama want this time? Nothing. Just checking up. "Checking up"? Why does she need to check us up? You snitched on me, didn't you? What? I told her nothing! There's nothing to tell her. Hell, I don't know! You like sucking up to her, right? I didn't tell her anything. She just called and asked us how we were. Look, this is why your little brother is here. So that your mom could monitor you while you party. Am I right? Can you believe this guy? Hey! I'm still talking to you. This asshole... Hey! Guess what? They're on the way. - Let me see. - They're arriving this afternoon. - That's what I'm fucking talking about. - It's so on, bro. Party! Don't forget my girl, okay? - I know! - That's what you promised... Mister? Mister? Yes, sir? We're heading off to town for a while. Are you going to have dinner here? Sure. We're only fetching some people. - Okay. - Right, Mister! Can you cook for six people? Six? Why six? We have... Guests. Guests? Who? Why do you have so many questions? Are you the owner of this place? Let it go, let it go. Mart, you wanna come with? No, no. Stay here. Understand? Wait for Mom's phone call. And tell her I went out with Paolo, okay? Fucking idiot. Let's go before this gets worse. Did she text? A while ago. Told me they were almost here. Where are they, anyways? Down in Manabat. But that was a while ago. That place is just twenty minutes away. Who are they with? Maybe they got lost? They hitched a ride from her cousin, apparently. I'll text her. - Sure. - Wait. What's taking them so long? - I know, bro. Fuck. - Right. Yeah, Hannah's okay but I like Geleen better. Who's more fuckable? Geleen, of course. I'm telling you, bro, if I waste my time with her... - Who's that? - It's them, I think. That's them. Go, go, go. - Come. - Give me someone good, okay? Hi! Thank you, Elmer! You guys settled? We're good. Pao, this is Elmer. My cousin. Hold this, bro. Sure. Where are the others? They're not here. - It's just you? - Isn't it obvious? Where's Hannah? She's not here! What do you mean "not here"? Hannah had a problem because her boyfriend found out that she's coming here with me. Boyfriend? Hannah has a boyfriend? It's her life. What about Geleen? She didn't want to go without Hannah. This is such bullshit. Why is it just you? After making me come here in the middle of nowhere, you still have the balls to talk to me like that? What do you mean "just you"? It's as if, - you're... - Okay, okay! Jesus. You should be thankful that I even came here without Hannah and Geleen. Alright already! Thank you. If that still means anything. It's just that you made all these promises. You told me Geleen and Hannah are coming. You're so full of shit, Nads. Fuck you, Paolo. Stop the car. I'm going back to Manila. Alright, alright! You think I'm kidding? Huh? Alright already. Jesus. You have problems. Fuck you! Fuck you too, asshole. Manong Dado... Yes, Martin? I have a question. What is it? Do you know who lives in that house? Out on the left? Which one? The first one on the left. That's Congressman Cerrudo's property. Congressman? Yeah. They're rich, you know. Bigtime. Very old political family. You know what? They're the only people running things here. Their faces are the only things that change. It's insufferable. Does somebody live there? No. That's a resthouse. There was a caretaker once. I don't know what happened to that asshole. Then who was that woman I saw at the beach? She was wading directly in front of the house. A woman? A guest, most likely. Well! Our Masters are here. I'll come greet them. What is this? This is... Mang Dado. The caretaker of this resthouse. Mang Dado. Nadine. - Good afternoon. - Hello. There. Mang Dado, take extra care of this one, alright? Because she might say bad things on the internet, - if she doesn't enjoy her stay here. - Hey, I'm not like that. And do you know Chino's little brother already? Hi! That's my little brother, Martin. Hey, Martin! We're introducing you. Hi, Martin. Martin's circumcised already. Right? Show us, Mart. Wasn't that just last year? - Come on, whip it out! - Let us see for a bit. Don't be shy. - Fuck you. - Hurry up. - What? - Why's he like that? - Asshole! Right? - He said "fuck you". I'll be going. Is he okay? But really, he's already circumcised. - Yeah, he's cut. - He's cut. I mean, the dude's tall. Are you sure? Of course. Why don't you try calling Hannah? Make them follow. Don't you understand? They can't come. Do you want to have a confrontation with Hannah's boyfriend? Then why did you invite Hannah when she already has a boyfriend? Don't you remember that she likes Chino? There you go! Shit. So, I'm the reason their relationship was almost ruined now? You're overreacting. You're just a crush. She doesn't want to be with you. And, also, as far as I can tell. Her boyfriend's rich. Chinese. Owns a property in Binondo. Is that so? So, in other words... She just wants to have a taste of this. Why not? Don't you like her too? Admit it. You already told us. Hey, hey! Where are you going? I'm getting more beer. I'll take a look if some of those are cold already. - Okay? - Alright, fine. Don't you feel sorry for my bestfriend? He thought he was getting some action here at the beach, but... You didn't even bring anyone for him. Sorry, okay? I wasn't informed that my job is to look for a hole for your bestfriend to fuck. Alright, alright. Try Geleen. Tell her to come. I already told you that she's not coming without Hannah. Forget it. I'll take care of it. You'll take care of it? What in the hell do you mean? You're going to let Chino fuck you? Fuck already? Can't we start at a blowjob for starters? Damn, and you're saying that to my face, huh? Sure! It was you who was acting like, "Oh, my poor bestfriend." Well, here you go. the solution. Happy? They were fucking right. You really are a slut. Yeah, I'm a slut. That's old news. So, we're not the only people here at the beach. Ma'am? What are you doing here? Why didn't you text me? Ask Sir. We came from a meeting. He told me to drive straight here. Are you going to eat here? I didn't prepare anything. That's okay. Sir told me we're buying food at the resort next door. Paolo, what the hell? Stop the act. Come on, you know you want to. Are you crazy? What? I thought you said you were a slut? I know. But... Chino might come back. Wow. Now, you're being demure when it comes to Chino. Just a little while ago you wanted to suck the dude's cock. Fuck. So? Does it feel good? Fuck you. Don't start something you can't finish. Don't you want it? - Go fucking faster! - Don't you want it? Let's eat! Come and eat while the sinigang is hot. It's made with fresh bangus that's why this is extra delicious. Martin! - Come. - What? Call Pao and Nadine. Where are they at? That's why you should go and look for them. Will I ask you if I know? Tell them it's time to eat. - Go. Go. - Manong, have you seen where they went? I haven't seen them in the house so they're most likely outside. Come on and get them. Tell them it's time to eat. Manong, this looks delicious. Paolo? They're calling for you. It's time to eat. Paolo? Nadine? Fuck. They're calling for you! Wait, wait. Shut up. - It's time for dinner! - What the hell! Shut up. Martin might hear you. What's the matter? Don't stop. Go faster! Fuck! Alright, come on. - Fuck! - Huh? What the hell? Are you a virgin? Go faster! Shit! Fuck! So, how was your day? Boring. What will I do here all by myself? I went out for a bit. Took a swim. You swam all by yourself? Yup. Don't go too far. That's dangerous. At only six years old, I already knew how to swim. Okay. Let's eat. I bought you your favorite. It's delicious. Fresh from Mrs. Garbanzos. Simon! - Sir? - Come and get your food. I'm alright, Sir. You guys go ahead. He told you that? I said yes already! Where have you guys been? I sent Martin to look for you, but he didn't see you guys. Around. - Come, eat. - Yeah. We'll just take a bath, Manong. Hey! What the hell did you guys do? Admit it. We ate each other. Are you done, Sir? Yes. Take it away. So you can eat. How are you, Simon? I'm okay, Sir. Will you sleep here? I don't know. What time is it? I hope you can stay here for a couple of days. I could, hopefully. You used to stay here for days with no one looking for you. We were in Manila then. Right now, we're in the province. People know my family here. If they see me hanging around. The news will spread. Everyone will know. That's going to be the death of my family. You know what? My back hurts from sitting in the office all day. Come. Give me a massage. I'm so exhausted. Daddy worked me for eight hours. Nonstop meetings. My lower back is killing me. Come here. What's the matter? Take off your clothes. Go and get the alcohol. Go. Wait, wait, wait. Do you know what part of your body is my favorite? Robs. Quiet. I'm resting. You drained me. Answer it. It might be important. Answer it. Wait. Hello? Hello, Kathy. Hey. How are you, baby? Yes. How's your brother? Yeah, I'll be home in a while. Yes. Okay, let me talk to your mother. Okay. Hello? Hello, Ginny. Did the documents that I need from Prospero arrive already? Yup. Yes. We're just here in Las Cuccinas. Is there anywhere we can buy soju? I doubt. You never know. I think there are in town. There's a convenience store there, as far as I know. Go buy some. So we can be more happy. Why? Aren't you happy enough with this? It's still different with soju. Is that so? Wait up. - You really never run out, do you? - What the hell is that? - What is that? - This is some good shit. Here. Open your mouth. I don't want it! What is that? - Didn't you want to be fucking happy? - Open! That might be a horse aphrodisiac, as far as I'm concerned. Look, even an elephant aphrodisiac wouldn't work on you. - Now, open your mouth! Here. - I'm doing it! Now, drink. Drink. Drink. - Drink, drink. - This is too sketchy, you asshole. Are you crazy? No. Look... If you see a gay Manananggal flying around you just ride with it. Fuck! What the hell did you make me take? It's nothing! Crazy ass. I took some a while ago, and I'm still safe. When are you coming back? If there's a chance, I'll come back. But you're going to be here on Friday, right? I promise. If I have time, I'll come back. Just promise me. We're taking a vacation in Japan, remember? I promise. It doesn't have to be Japan. I'm fine here. Alright, okay. I have to go. Okay. I have to go. Bye. Simon. If Manang asks, Tell her we went to Mr. Arellano's house. - Copy, Sir. - Don't forget. - She reports to your Ma'am. - Okay, Sir. Paolo, it's so nice here. Come sit with me. Are you crazy? It might give. Look at this woman. She's fucked up, isn't she? You know... Some people say it's better to make babies in a hammock. No way! I might go dizzy, and then I'll fall. Well, if he doesn't want to, then you go, Chino. Come here and sit with me. And what the hell am I supposed to do there by your side? Come here and you'll find out. Goddamn. You can say that to my face? How brazen. Give me that. Chino, tell me the truth. Given the chance. Will you fuck me? Fucking shit. This girl really is fucked up. Hey, he's blushing! Hey, I'm not blushing! This is just tipsy. Hey, where are you going? He can't hear you. Where are you going? Around. Trying to get some air. Get some air! Get some air. To the moon! - It's cold at the moon. - Hey! You're fucked up, aren't you? Well, how about you? You look high as fuck. Just a bit. But this guy? He's super fucked up. - That's old news. - What the hell was that? Hey, what gives? - Stop the act, dude. - Look at this asshole. Stop being a pussy, Chino. I mean, it's fucking obvious that you're enjoying this. Look, you have a raging hard-on! Yes? Hi! One more. Martin, you're here. - Good morning. - Good morning. Come and eat your breakfast. I made fried rice and tocino. It's good. I'll eat later, Manong. I'll just wait for Chino to wake up. Suit yourself. Are you going to swim? The water's nice. It's lukewarm. Where's Chino? Still asleep. Serves your crazy brother right. He tried to keep up with Paolo. That guy only has alcohol running through his veins. Even paired it up with weed. How about you? You drink? - You use weed? - No. Why not? You don't want to be like your brother, huh? I don't blame you. You know, you shouldn't try to be too good. You know the Lord. If you're too good, he takes you early. Any reactions here? I'm talking my head off here, and you're just being bland. I know. Let's swim. Come. Hurry! What's wrong? I'm not gonna drown you. Come on! Let's go swimming. Hey! Come here. Why are you always in a hurry? Have a seat here. Hurry up. Are you scared of me? Why would I be scared of you? Come here. Why are you laughing? Because you're so far. That's why I told you to scoot over. You're cute, you know? You ever kissed a girl? Sure. Really? When? I don't want to talk about it. You ever grabbed a woman's tits? That's what I thought. - Hey. - There. This is a breast! Hey, that's embarrassing. What's the matter? Are you shy? That's alright. I'm not. - Alright, thank you. I'll be going now. - What's wrong? It's just a tit! Thank you. What a bummer. Well, well. You're awake but you're still high. Did you just baptize Chino's little brother? No way! I just gave him a little orientation. I let him hold my tit. You're crazy. I'm trying to get you with the Kuya, but you molested with the baby brother. Hey, that dude's not a baby anymore. He can make a baby already. That was a good sleep. Ah, fuck. Good shit. What's your name? Why are you always snooping around the house? Do you know the owner? No. You're on vacation with the group next door, aren't you? Come here. I don't bite. Your name? Martin. Martin Montecillo. Wow. Full name. My name is Adele. Nice to meet you, Martin. Nice to meet you, too. I just noticed. You're always by yourself. You don't want to join your other friends? Those are my brother's friends. We don't jive. Okay. I'm just a plus-one. I feel sorry for you. You're on a vacation, but you're all by yourself. I'd choose this over than forcing myself in their group. That's true. I'll be going now. Take care, Martin. What are you even doing there? Hurry up, I really have to pee! Hey! You're fucking jacking off again, aren't you? Hey! Hurry up! Martin! Can I ask a question? To whom? To Martin. Nadine has a question for you. It's just a bit personal, okay? Come on. Just shoot. Okay. Martin... You're still a virgin, aren't you? Why? If Martin's still a virgin... Are you willing to help him with that? Is that okay with you, Chino? Do what you want. I don't care. You know what? You're all perverts. You thought about all kinds of naughty shit just from a simple question. Are you sure? My little brother? What? What am I? He hasn't even kissed a girl yet. How can you be so sure of that? At his age? He doesn't know anything but... - Fuck. - That's what you think you know. Why not? What did you do, huh? Nothing! I did nothing. You're a crazy bitch. What did you do to Chino's little bro? I told you. Nothing. Fuck, Chino. Step it up, bro. Your little brother got way ahead of you. What am I supposed to do other than jerk off? Manong, I'm just going to wash this. I got it. Just put it over here. Go. I can't talk for long. I'm in a meeting. I just wanted to ask if you're coming over tonight. I'll be calling. Or through text. Robbie. I'm with my Dad. I can't talk right now. I just want to know what this is. What are you talking about? What's your plan? Plan? For me. For us! We're talking about this again? Look at you. You're mad again. I don't know what else to say without getting you angry. It's not important if I'm going to be happy or angry. What's important for me is to know the truth. Where do I really place in your life? Hey! Wait! Come here! Why do you look like you've seen a ghost? Sorry. I'm really sorry. Why are you saying sorry? Have you done anything wrong to me? How old are you, Martin? Seventeen. But I'm turning eighteen next month. Happy birthday! Where are your friends? They're still at the house. Do you have any plans today? Nothing much. To chill, probably. Alright. Both of us don't any plans, so... Just hang out with me. Come on! Don't you want to? Aren't you coming? Are you still in school? I hope so. Yeah. What year are you in? Grade eleven. You're only in senior high? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just shocked. Grade eleven? Why aren't you eating? Are you full? Or are you just shy? I already ate. Well, why didn't you say so? I cooked a whole lot for you. I got embarrassed. Then... Eat it. It's bad to waste food. You know... My youngest brother? He's like... Two years younger than you. Right. Because he's in grade nine. Was it grade nine? Do you have a lot of siblings? It's just me and my older brother. Must be nice to be you. Just the two of you. Us? We're five in the family. We're not a rich family. That's why I left them abroad, and, that's why I'm here in the Philippines. Enough about me. It's your turn to tell me something. What will I even tell you? Do you have a girlfriend? I don't know if she's my girlfriend already. How did that happen? I really don't know. Do you like her? Does she like you? I think so. Or so I thought. Or so you thought? You have a huge problem. Can I ask you something? Why are you all by yourself in this house? Long story. But I'm not really here by myself. That's my boyfriend's house. We're just the same, you know. I don't really know if he's my boyfriend. Maybe I'm just assuming everything. But we're seeing each other for almost three years already. Three years and you still don't know if you're together? He doesn't want to talk about it. Why not? He said that the important thing is we're together. That's all. I shouldn't expect anything else. If he wanted to be together with you, why doesn't he want to be your boyfriend? He says it's not important. Does he love you? I hope so. Maybe. Let's not talk about it. I hope he loves you. People still hope for that? I don't necessarily agree. Personally, if two people get together and are okay with it, Then it's okay. I think about that sometimes. - You know? - What? That love is a hindrance. Just because you love him, but you don't know if he loves you? Hey, where are you going? I don't wanna talk to you. Are you mad? I just... You keep on saying things that... You're making me cry! Fuck, this is some good shit. Oh? Where's he been? I think he went to the house next door. What even is there? Maybe he went to see the woman that we saw yesterday. Martin? - Yeah. - Trying to get some already? - Fuck me. - Hey, Martin! Where have you been, huh? There. "There". - What do you mean, "there"? - "There". - The walk of triumph. - This asshole, I'm still talking- - Come here! - Hey, that's enough! Mister Masturbater! - I'll bet he's going to do it again. - Don't hit your head! He's going to do it again. - Yeah, I bet. - You have too much energy! Martin! Did you go to the house next door? I saw you walking back. Do you know anything about the woman who lives next door? She doesn't live there. She's a guest, like you guys. Most likely... She's the woman of the Congressman's son. The woman? Yeah! The Congressman's son is Robbie. He has a wife and two kids. Sometimes, they come there for vacation. Did you meet the woman? Hey. Be careful, okay? Be careful of what? Don't let yourself get in trouble! Tell me the truth, bro. Is she your girlfriend, already? Why? You want to fuck her, don't you? You're crazy. I'm just asking. Shut up. Admit it. Dude, Nadine is crazy in bed. Flexible. She's a cheerleader you know. You're still high from last night. Shut up. You know, Nadine is easy to negotiate with. Do you want me to tell her for you? Tell her what? That you want to fuck her brains out. You're too crazy. Don't believe me? Nadine! Hey! Fuck, Pao! What the hell are you doing? I'm helping you. Don't be a pussy. I'm telling you. She's game, dude. Holy shit. - Shit... - Here we go. How about her? Look, look. You want that? Fuck, she's so hot. With looks like that, somebody owns her for sure. For the meantime only. Listen. We know who lives in that house. And that? That's the Flavor of the Month of the Congressman's son. Fuck. Look at that. So, she's with a bigwig. For sure. There was a time, that place was full of starlets. Every day, we see wannabe actresses wading about. You know? That guy's good. What do you mean, "good"? Dude, you only need money to get pussy like that! I'll bet you she's only worth 50 thousand. Her? Come on. She's sexy as fuck. But she looks like she's a good fuck. Am I right? For sure. And look. She looks like... Like she's the bomb at giving blowjobs. Fuck you. How'd you know? I mean, just look at the shape of her mouth. Fuck, dude. You're out with it, man. You're even closing your eyes. Looks like you're having the time of your life. - Man, you never know. - But she's really hot. Maybe it'll happen tonight. Dude, I think she's fucking playing us. She knows. Look! She knows that we're looking at her. Shit. I'm getting a hard-on, man. Ugh... I can't take it anymore, man. you down? Shall we make a move? Dude, are you crazy? Just come with me, man. It won't take long. Ma'am? You scared me. What's with you? Sir told me to go ahead. He's following in a while. Why didn't he text or call, at least? Because he's with Ma'am Ginny and his kids. They went to church. It's his grandfather's death anniversary. So after he goes to church with his family, he'll come home to me? Am I right? That's it? Shit. An intervention. Who the hell was that? An employee of her owner, maybe. You guys are disgusting. Like rabid fucking dogs. You've been ogling at the neighbor for God knows how long. Wow! Jealous much? "Jealous"? You're just pigs. Look at your shorts! You have hard-ons! It's obvious that you're horny for her. Wait! Chino tells me that his hard-on's for you. Really? Thank you. - Fuck, dude. It's really showing. - I know. Ma'am? I just got a text from Sir. I know. He's on his way. Are you hungry? The other two? By the beach, making a bonfire. Okay. They're going to get wasted again. Manong Dado, do we still have tequila? Alright. Don't we have enough back there? No, we don't. Here. Take this. I got this one. What is it? Do you need anything? I'm looking for... - For... - Who? For Adele? What do you need from her? Martin! You know this guy, Ma'am? That's Martin. What's the problem with you? He's on vacation with the guys next door. He's my friend. Next door neighbor. Didn't you just tell me that you're going to buy ice? Before your Sir arrives? Okay, Ma'am. Come with me. Bad timing. What's up? Is there a problem? No. I just didn't know you had company. My boyfriend is on his way here. That's his sidekick and driver, Simon. So, we can't stay for long. I thought you were just mad at me. That's nothing! I'm really just busy. Okay. You really have to go now. Hey! Come here, fucker. Help us out. You don't have a chance with the neighbor. The guard is there, asshole. He has a better chance with the guard, man. Hurry up and come here. Let's go. This is because you jack off all the time. Stop jacking off for once, will you? Come on. Here. This one. - Take it. You carry that. - It's sharp. Don't jack it off, all right? That's not a fucking dick, dude. - Were you able to buy some ice? - Yes, Sir. Get the food at the back. Okay, Sir. Wait. Where is she? Preparing. Okay. - Adele. - I thought you wouldn't make it tonight. I told you. I'll try. You're too busy nowadays. When am I never busy? Right. You were with your family the whole day. It's my grandfather's death anniversary. Yeah. He told me. Simon and I will prepare the food. You might be hungry. Fuck. Shit. Fuck, shit! Fuck! Shit. Sir, are you okay? I'm fine. I probably ate too much. What's wrong? What are you feeling? Gas pains. This is probably just indigestion. Don't worry about it... Just go help Adele in the kitchen. Simon! Simon! Please bring whiskey. Okay, Sir. Fuck. Shit. What is happening to me? Okay, guys. Bottoms up, okay? Wait, there's something missing. Where's the salt and the lemon? Salt and lemon? Here! - Are you serious? - Calamansi. Stop being a bitch. I'm going to suck on that? Calamansi? Just do it! Alright, get this. Whose shot is this? Here. Bro. And of course. My brother. Just one shot. I don't drink tequila. Just one shot. Please. Just a bit. Dude, nobody dies from one shot of tequila. This fucking guy... Just a bit. Just fucking do it, dude. Don't be a pussy. It's just a shot! There we go! Alright, okay. At the count of three! One. Two. Three! Are you okay? Have you seen your brother's face? So? Are you happy now? - Tell Mama. I don't care. - Here. Calamansi. Why are you so quiet? It's strange. Just eat, okay? I know you're tired. So, are you gonna go home to them? Why did I even ask? Adele... I know what you're gonna say, and I understand. If you're here, then you're here. I should be happy with what you can give me. Right? Don't worry, Adele. I promise you. Don't make promises you can't keep. I don't want to hear it. I might get my hopes up and end up getting hurt. Just eat. Wait. - What? Why? - I need to take a leak. Why? You know what... Just do it in the sea. - Yuck! - I won't look. You're so disgusting! It's dark! Plus, I do my business there as well. So that's why there are so many dead fish floating around. "Dead fish". Asshole. So? You game? Shut up. Fuck, dude, I told you it was okay. And it's also okay with her. Stop being a pussy. She's drunk! Go, bro! Go, bro! Stop the timid act, asshole. How about you? You wanna try this? Hey! Don't even think about trying to join your brother! What are you doing here? Okay. Pao sent you? I want it, too. Oh. You want it. What do you want? Is this what you want? You like it? Or you don't? Are they waiting for you at home? Not yet. I'll probably try and lie down for a bit. Do you want to lie down the bedroom? I could because I had a bit of indigestion earlier. Sir, are you done eating? Can I take it away? Sure. I'm going to lie down for a bit. I'm going to get some rest. Sir, do you want me to bring you home? What about the car you brought? You're going to have a hard time. Just take the leftovers home. Give it to your family. Okay, Sir. Thank you. You should get some rest. It's hot. I'll open the aircon. Are you still hot? I thought we were going to get some rest? I'm sorry. There's no round two. You okay? I almost choked because of you. Not because of the size of your dick, but... It looks like you haven't came in a long time. It's okay. Love you. What happened? You're an asshole! Did you make my bestfriend happy? He's gone. Exhausted. Sleeping like a baby. You're too good, Nads. Come give me a kiss. You're really insatiable. Now, your friendship with Chino is sealed. Somewhere in your mouth, your bestfriend's cum is swimming freely. You're an asshole, Nadine! What's the matter? Relax! Nobody gets pregnant just from the mouth. Fuck you! You're too disgusting! You bitch! Look. I promise. Okay? There you go again. Be careful of your promises. I know you're having a hard time. But I'll make sure to always take care of you. Please don't tell me you love me. Why not? Because if you really love me, you're going to show it. Don't make promises you can't keep. Just remember. Okay? I know they're waiting for you. Go. Get dressed. Before you travel. Okay. Yes. Wait. Wait. What's wrong? - Sir! - Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm okay. I just ate too much. Okay. Sir, did you take your medicine earlier? Of course. I took it. Are you sure you don't wanna get him to take you home? I'm okay, I'm okay. He was feeling bad even a while ago. - This is just from the heat, it's fine. - Let's just take him to the doctor. Let's take him to the doctor. No need, no need. Okay? - Sir, I'll just drive you home. Okay? - These are just gas pains, okay? I got it, I got it. Okay. Sir! - Sir! - Robbie! Sir! What's your problem? What's happening? Let's take him to the hospital! - Where is the nearest hospital! - I'll handle this! - I'll handle this, just stay here! - Robbie! I'm coming! That's not going to happen! You can't be seen by people. - Just stay here! - Hey, Robbie! What happened to you? You were okay a while ago, right? What happened? Robbie! What's your deal? Get out of the way! Robbie! Martin. What are you doing? Did you just cry? What happened to you? Nothing. Don't tell me that you went back to the woman who lives next door. Martin, she's a mistress. She belongs to the Congressman's son. Oh, okay. I get it. You saw something you weren't supposed to see. You hurt yourself. That's because you don't think! You look where you're not supposed to. You don't know her. And you? You know her? Is that it? It is what it is. My father told me this before he died, You only have two choices in life. To be the one who victimizes, or to be the victim. To use, or be used. That's your choice. Don't fool yourself with grand ideas of love. And most importantly, don't mistake love for lust. Come here. The day will come when you will realize all of this. Where's Robbie? We were too late to the hospital. The doctors tried everything, but it was hopeless. What happened? Last night he was just fine. If he was feeling something unusual, he didn't say anything about it. Well, where is he? Ma'am. I need to see him! That's not possible. Why not? Do you want to smear his name? Also, have a little respect. Respect? Yes. For Ma'am Ginny. What about me? Ma'am Ginny is his wife. Then what am I? You already know the answer to that. Ma'am. I'll come back for you tomorrow. Just pack your things. Ma'am Ginny might know that you're here. I'm just tying up every loose end. Ma'am! I'm going to bring a co-worker tomorrow to help fetch you. I'll be going now. Where's Manong Dado? I don't know. I think he and Pao went to town. Where's your brother? Asleep. Looks like he drained all his energy last night. Why? Ask him yourself. They're here. Hey! Where are you? What's up? Oh, you're there. We still went out early, you know. There were just too many people in the market. Right, Manong? You can't blame them with the news going about. Something happened in the Cerrudo house. What happened, Manong? Someone who was living next door died. Who? Robbie. The Congressman's son. The boyfriend of the woman you were jacking off to. He died there? Heart attack. Shit. I'm jealous. Why? She's too good, you know? Really deadly. You're an asshole. What do you think she did that killed the guy? You know what I think? She sat on his face. Dude! Dude. As in literally in the house? At the resthouse? I don't know. Look, there's going to be a lot of people here if he died there. Wait a minute, why are you so affected? Is it because of your hot friend? Martin. Just behave. Don't even think about involving yourself in their mess. Behave. She's right. Also, they might think that you killed the guy so you could take the girl for yourself. Or you sat on the guy's face. They might check us. I still have weed on me. Adele. I heard about what happened. Is it true? Are you okay? Where is he? They took him away. They didn't even let me see him. He's not coming back. What am I gonna do? He told me he's going to make it up to me. What can he do now? It's going to be okay. Maybe they're looking for you. I'm fine. Why don't you go home for a while? How about you? I'm okay. Are you sure you're okay here by yourself? I'm used to it. Just go home for now. Thank you, Martin. Thank you? For what? Nothing. Damn. Where have you been? You visited the house next door again, didn't you? Martin. Be careful around that woman, okay? Her pussy is deadly! Look at you, you're too thin. Your heart might not be able to handle her. You're going to break down. It's coming, it's coming! This fucking... I will never forget those few days that we spent during our vacation in Sto. Tomas. Where I met the woman who lived next door. When I went back to see Adele, the house was closed. There was no one inside anymore. Adele? Adele! Grab the things in the kitchen. Okay, Sir. Adele? Adele! Adele! Adele? Adele? Adele? I don't know when, or how Adele left. I don't know who fetched her, or drove her to wherever she might have went. All I know is, that ever since that day, I never forgot about the woman who taught to me what it truly means to be a man. And sometimes, still remember Adele. Because she will never be erased from my heart. Martin! What's the matter? We were looking for you. Come on, we're leaving.
