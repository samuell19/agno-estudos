THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON "NAMÍBIA, NÃO!", A THEATRICAL PRODUCTION BY ALDRI ANUNCIAÇÃO BRAZIL SOMEWHERE IN THE FUTURE Sir, let's go. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Antonio. Before reading the text forwarded by the Association of High-Melanin Lawyers, I want to thank you, on my own behalf, for the opportunity to speak to you. Attention, citizens. This area is restricted to the press. What happened to that lady last week, for someone with my skin, says a lot. Maybe you'll never understand what it means to witness that scene. But on that day, I remembered that I, as an innocent child, used to ask, "Do we see history as it is happening?" Today is a historic day. Ms. Elenita, 84 years old, former taxi driver, has been chosen as a symbol of a new era. She'll be the first high-melanin citizen to receive indemnity for time in slavery. I can't hide my feeling. It's hard to be professional. Only a few people had the privilege of witnessing this moment, and I confess that I'm extremely moved. Metallic objects are prohibited. Metallic objects are prohibited. -Shit... -What's going on? You won't open it? -Ma'am, calm down. -I can't get in. They've backed out. There's no more money. There's no more indemnity. What the hell? I used to be black. Today I'm high-melanin. I was just a student. Today I'm a lawyer. And I've always believed in the power of words. Having said that, we in the Association of High-Melanin Lawyers want to declare our repudiation of the cancelling... of the indemnity for the financially challenged, melanized people. History would have been made and it was interrupted. It was 400 years of work, using the talent of the melanized for construction, cooking, languages and much more that history hides. It was without salary. Without respect. Without decency. Offering savage treatment that created consequences which we feel to this day in our skin. We have spent years fighting for indemnity. We fought for what's fair and we won. But now the City Council backs out on the social reparation? Indemnities like these have been common throughout history. The least that should happen is to find another compensation. The high-melanin people deserve to be indemnified. What's this about indemnity? It must be a joke... How much would that cost? The economy would crash. Sometimes I feel like grabbing... Excuse me. EXECUTIVE ORDER I want to hear what they'll say, because the way things are... It goes really well with our people. -Excuse me! -Guys, it's way too hot! -How are you? -Better now. I wish someone would spit on me just to cool me off. -A kiss will do, baby? -Always. -Told you I'd eat you alive. -That's nasty! -I don't know how you handled it. -It was very hard. Seeing that old lady in the middle of the street being shamed. -I wanted to punch everyone. -There won't be any money. But I have faith something will happen. With no fighting? With no brawling? -He'll preach now. -Listen up. I love my country. I love Brazil! I love Brazil! But sometimes I really want to hate it. So leave, blackie. -Come again? -Well... If you can't take the heat, leave. -Let's go home. -Let's order some dessert! What do you think? We can order dessert. Hey, De. Look at me. Don't. Get back to your table! Come here, come here. -Good evening. -Good evening. -How are you, ma'am? -I like your look! It's very colorful! That's nice, you guys! Hey! There are so many whites stealing in Brasília, I need to protect my bag. I'm sorry, fam. The indemnity is not for the rich. It's for screwed people like me. You? Since when you're screwed? Since I have no cash. And there's more. I think we have to point fingers in their faces. -Don't you? -I'm tired of this black talk. This Afro-descendant that has become high-melanin... What do you want to talk about, then? -Other things. -Like what? The stock exchange, astronomy. You're turning into professional melanin. -No... -What's your profession, Andre? -I'm a journalist. -High-melanin. You go to seminars about melanin, you go to silent retreats with the melanized, you just followed Martin Luther King's Path... Capitu, c'mon! First you should find a place to live. That hurt. It didn't hurt. I know you love living with me. My nephew will love it too. You think all women need to be mothers! -You don't want children? -I do, but it's not a dream. -Just three of them. -Three? Are you crazy? And there's more. When money comes in, I'll put new windows in the house. -Come again? -I love African stained glass. I'll make them windows. -You're crazy. -I like it. I'm in. This kind of stained glass doesn't exist. Of course it does! The last bookstore closes in Rio. The skirt she was wearing was too short! In his speech at the university, a scientist said global warming is a sham. My freedom isn't negotiable. Don't let go of each other's hands? When did they hold my hand? RETURN YOURSELF NOW MY PREFACE WAS SO DIFFICULT, MY PAST HAS NO WORDS... BUY INSULIN In Brazil we believe in the right to come and go. To come and to go back. So go back. Be whoever you want to be. Live according to your roots. If you want social reparation for time in slavery, a government for a fairer Brazil will offer you much more. The opportunity to go back to Africa. Now you have the chance to return to your origins. You won't pay for anything. The Brazilian government will give you the one-way ticket. Just find a registration office in your city and go there. Return yourself now. -Good morning, Mr. Antonio. -Hey, Mr. João. They asked to leave these flyers in the building hall. RETURN YOURSELF NOW! So? -Well... -Yeah... Well... -They told you to hand them out? -Yeah. -What's wrong? -Look at this. They're my next-door neighbors. Did you get it too? I don't think it's right. -Good morning, everyone. -Good morning. Good morning, beautiful people! How are you? What's going on? I think... I mean, in my opinion, all this started when you black people decided to obtain things through laws instead of your own merit. I wasn't in the racial quota, Ms. Isildinha. My father was. Maybe that's why I didn't need to be. -No, my point of view... -Your point of view? Always a protagonist, right, Ms. Isildinha? I'm sorry to interrupt. Is Maria Gadú melanized? -Excuse me, Jap. -Of course. -Really? -Obviously! It's hard to tell who's black today. In Brazil, everyone's got one foot in the kitchen. No... For the love of God. Dude, pay attention. If they look black, they're black. -What about brown people? -Brown is the sugar! -Are you going back to Africa? -If you go, let me know. My daughter wants to rent an apartment here! -And the saint? -What saint, Mr. João? Our Lady of Aparecida, the patron saint. -She was... -It's mud. They found her at the bottom of the river. -That's how she got darker. -Say it like it is, Ms. Isildinha. And Camila Pitanga, Mr. João? Is she going? I think in her case it's optional. She can choose. Twice. If she's black, and if she'll go. And those with vitiligo? Do they go? It's a nice color. I wanted to be like that. -You want to be black? -Yeah. Black and yellow? -That's fucked up... -Rude. To be fair, there should be racial quotas for whites, for the non-melanized. I think white quotas would be fair in prisons, slums... -So now it's crazy black nonsense? -No, it's neurotic white nonsense. I have to go. Tell me everything later. RETURN YOURSELF NOW The Brazilian government is very optimistic about this new plan for social reparation. Your country of origin, in the African continent, awaits you. Mine is... black. We are here to serve you. -Any questions? -I have a question. Ma'am. Ma'am. -Not like this. -Please. -I won't speak like this. -Please. Yes. You, sir. -We're not obliged to go, right? -No. Only if you want to. Here, here. Please. -Here, here. -Yes. You, sir. Andre Rodrigues, Affirmation Blog. -Blog? -Yeah, it's coming back. Inspector, if going to Africa is so good, why don't you volunteer? Your name is Andre, right? Well, Andre. The Return Yourself Now plan establishes that this offer is for citizens who resemble, even if it's only a little, African descendants. I don't look African. -It will be a visual identification. -Just one more! Just one more! Hang on, guys! -Just one more, please. -Yes. Who's going to polish our teeth? -What? -Our teeth. The quality of the animal is in the smile. That's a stupid question. -Just one more, inspector. -Yes, ma'am. I'm Giovana Ricci from Laranjeiras Vanguard. Who's going to polish their teeth? We're done now. Our office will be open from 8am to 6pm for those interested in volunteering. I came here really early. It's weird, but... Sir. You know you could have a much better life if you go back, right? -I'll think about it. -Really? Yeah. But you know you have a little black blood, right, ma'am? -Now I'm being called names. -Called names? I didn't say that. Can you turn that off? You're an inspector, right? Is that what you do? If I bring you spoiled meat, will you inspect it? Do you inspect drainpipes? Restaurant kitchens? Trash cans? Respect this institution! I'm going home. I have better things to do. This can't be serious. Bye-bye. We'll fight till the end! -It's our right. -There's nothing I can do. -There's nothing I can do! -Hold on, everyone. -What's this? -Who are you? Antonio Gama. I'm the lawyer sent by the association. Hallelujah! Mr. Antonio, they want to close the course. I'm trying to explain to them that the order came from above. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. Excuse me. They're our social rights! -How can this be? -I've explained. No fighting! We can still resolve things without violence. -Really? -Yes. Yes. Speak. AMBULANCE GO BACK TO AFRICA -Good afternoon, Pedro. -Hey. Nice car. Are you keeping up with the high-melanin thing? I've heard. I've heard. You can't say "black" anymore. -Right. -It's high-melanin citizen now. Are you keeping up? Today our radio programming will be different. -He's crazy. -No samba, no pagode... Now it'll be only classical music, Josias! What's with the surprise? I missed you. -Let's go? -Yeah. -Bye, Pedro. -Bye. -A lot of snuggling? -A lot of snuggling. Are you happy? That too. What else? Can we talk later? Capitu. If something happens in the street, call me, okay? I'll go get you. Or come home and I'll protect you. I see! You're my knight in shining armor! It's not that. Okay, if anything happens, our home is our rendezvous point. You come back here and I'll save you. Alright. Baby. If you had to pick one song... Just one. What would it be? I don't know. There are so many songs in the world. I can't pick one. My song would be this one. Come here. Come here. Hey! Hold on! Save me some room! Let me see! C'mon, kid, show it to me! Come here, come here, come here. You're getting better. What a pro! Wait, wait. One day the sun came up so bright... -That's great! -That's beautiful, baby. Beautiful. But not now. You guys are lame. Let's go to the party then! -Bye, you guys! -Bye. -Bye! -Bye, you guys! Have fun! Life is beautiful, life is beautiful Really? What now? Everything will be alright. It will. My vote is yes! That's right! For my state and for my children, my vote is yes! -Excuse me, I want to speak! -There are only two left. For my people, my vote is no! What about me? I have a right to vote! Silence! Silence! I want to give my vote! Africa, yes! Eritrea or Namibia? Not Namibia. Egypt. Cape Verde. Malawi. Jamaica. Mozambique. Mother Africa, I came from there Will Jorge have a job there? in my veins Angola. You'll love it. save Africa, long live Africa -Hawaii. -Do you surf? -Yes. Sometimes. -Africa has waves. Cape Town. Are you black, ma'am? Johannesburg. -Wait. Are you...? -Yes, but I'm not very dark. -Your parents? -Melanized. I can't go to Amsterdam, right? Okay. Give me Cape Verde. Hi. -So? -I've decided. I want to go to Africa. I want to go and come back, obviously. I want to see the place my ancestors came from, to learn the story that was denied to me. I want to step on the ground where Xango was born, my father Xango. But I want to decide when and how I'll go. Not because of a law. And there's more. If I want to go to Paris first, that's up to me, not you. I'm free. -Free. -It's the ministry. -Hello. -Isabel Garces? -Yes, this is she. -Can you talk? -Of course. Perfect. -There's a new guideline. -Did you see what happened? -I watched the voting. -Just capture and send away. -Just go for it? -You know about the protocol? -Of course. I was just waiting for permission from you. -No turning back. -Great. By the people and for the people. Santiago. -Yes. -Get him. -Calm down. -No way. -Where's the journalist? -I don't know. If we turn around, they disappear! -Go look on the stairs! -Isabel. Isabel. The new guidelines. Sir. "The government for a fairer country determines that citizens with features which resemble, even slightly, African descent, from this day, 13th of May, will be captured and deported to African countries as a corrective measure for the mistake committed by the former Portuguese colony and continued by the Brazilian Republic. This mistake produced four centuries of free labor carried out by a population wrongfully transferred from their lands of origin to Brazilian lands. With the intention of correcting this grave mistake, Executive Order 1888 determines the return of those citizens and their descendants to African lands as an urgent matter. Executive Order 1888." It's with great satisfaction that I take over this ministry. The Ministry of Return. It was created to expedite the process of returning the melanized. Those formerly called black people will immediately be removed from the Brazilian territory. -I'm white. -What? You're black! This is why I appeal to the melanized. Go to the Return Offices. Cooperate with Brazil's future. The ministry intends to avoid using force, but, if necessary, it will happen. Take your hands off me! I told you to shut up! POLICE Get back! -You have to leave now! -Stop in the name of the greatest! -What the hell? -Let me go! Stop that! -Hold her! -Hey, wait! What are you doing? They're students! De. De. De! No, I'll run away. Mr. João! What do I do? My documents, my wallet... You have no right! You bastard! Take your hands off him! Not my son! No! He's my son! No! No! Go back, go back! Mr. João! RETURN YOURSELF Hey! Show some respect! Show some respect Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let go of me! Get off! Get off! Let me go! Doctor, my daughter did so well in math at school! -That's great, Lelia! -She makes me so proud! She might even get a trip abroad. Imagine her having to get a passport! That's too much. Everything will be alright. There're two here! C'mon! -What's going on? -Who are you? I'm Dr. Maria Carolina. I'm in charge today. -Not anymore. We are. -What? High-melanins aren't allowed in this hospital. -This one is Cuban. -I'm from Bahia! -Over my dead body! -Go away! What will I do in Africa? -What is there for me in Africa? -After her! -Grab her! -Come on! Come on! -Hold her hand! -Take her already! -Let her go! -Where's the doctor? -Let me go! -Go after her! -Go after her! -Try to find her! Andre, brother. Where are you? Come home. Capitu, it's me again. Call me. The government determines that citizens with features that resemble even a little of African ancestry... -I want the list of melanized. -Wait, wait. I'll help you. I'll get it for you. Keep your voice down. We're in charge here. What the hell is this? Let her go! Let her go! Capitu, if you're in the street, do as we said. Come back home. -Stop! -Don't run! -Don't run. -He went in there! Don't move. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop right there! Stop! Stop! Stop, stop! Stop! Stop right there! Stop! Stop! Help me, help me. -Help me. -Easy. -I need my leg. -Come here. -Slowly. -I'm sorry. I couldn't just bring you. You saw how crazy the streets are. -I'm going. My mom is worried. -Okay. Stay strong, okay? ATTENTION ARTICLE 150 PROTECTS US INJUNCTION AGAINST EXECUTIVE ORDER 1888 Capitu! I thought you were Capitu. She's not here? Let's go after her. No, we'll wait for her. The hospital said she ran away. I have faith she'll come home. -They can't come in here. -They can do whatever they want! No, no. Article 150 in the Penal Code. They can't come in without a warrant. They can deport us to Africa, but they can't come in here? That's right! It's surreal. How did we not see this? How did we let it get to this? How did we laugh at this, Antonio? -What do I do? -Man, I'm thinking here... If we're like this in an apartment, imagine the craziness in the slum. -Capitu is pregnant. -What? She's pregnant. You're going to have a beautiful family! You'll have a beautiful family. But right now? She's pregnant? It's my nephew! My nephew! -Get down! -Mom! Do as I say! Mom! Get down, get down! Mom! Come on! Do as I say! Let go! -Run, sweetie! -Stop it! -Stop, stop! -Stop! Stop! Run, sweetie, run! Stop! I told you to stop! Stop right there! -Let go of the child. -She's my daughter! -She's my daughter! -I told you to let go of the child! -Leave us alone! She's my daughter! -The fuck she is! -I showed our documents! -You leave, she stays! -She's coming with me! -You leave! -Sweetie... Leave her alone! -She stays, you leave! Stop it! Stop it! You'll leave. She stays. Are you okay? Go! Go! Go! Run away with her! Let's go! -Go up there! -Let's go that way! You go this way, we'll go that way! Go, go, go! Suspicious bomb attacks in slums across the country eliminated many melanized at once. International entities are split. Some declared repudiation, and others declared support. But the government says... We ask the population to express their desires and cooperate with this action. Your cooperation is very important. We went to the streets to hear the people. People just stay home, doing nothing. I'm in the street to help my country. I'm here to fight this. I have a mixed-race family. It was your choice! Does Brazil want these violent police? They're treating you like hunting dogs. You have to fight against this Executive Order. Residents of Tonel Favela say no one respects Article 150. Did you come to surrender? What do you mean? Thanks to almighty God, I don't fit in the melanin profile. Look at my gums, honey. I have 1,000 years of Europe in my blood. Pureblood, right. I just came here because my area is filled with appropriate people. I want to cooperate. Antonio. Antonio. -Come here. -What is it? Check this out. Listen. High-melanins' telephones lines, internet and cable TV have been turned off. Thank you. Antonio, man! They cut our communication! -We are besieged, Antonio! -Wait. They cut... Who is it? It's Ms. Isildinha, dear. -May I help you? -Can you come outside, please? -No. He won't. -What do you mean? She told him to. He must come. What's this about? Waiting is not advised. You'll have to leave at some point. We have no reason to leave. I have a series of posts of you inciting hate, sir. -I just said what happened! -Stop whining. -Racist. -Never! I'm just doing my job. Gosh, now everyone is called racist. Listen to me. I've had a black maid, a black friend, and now I have black neighbors. I also suffer racism because of my hair. I'm only here to fulfil my role as a citizen. -So are we. -Antonio, right? Your report consists of injunctions against the law. -That won't do any good. -Go away now, you dirtbag. What? Santiago, record this. Go, Santiago! Dirtbag, dirtbag, dirtbag, dirtbag! -We won't leave. -Close it! Close it! What about the doctor? She's in the street, right? Great. When you leave, let me know. When my daughter comes back from her trip, she'll want to rent your place. Record whenever you can. -Everything is evidence. -I know. There. I'm sorry it took so long. There are so many keys... BANISHING BLACK PEOPLE FROM BRAZIL WILL REDUCE VIRUSES AND YELLOW FEVER Don't record this, Santiago! -Which one? -Here. Please. Where is it? Ouch! -Give me your hand. -Hold her hand, sweetie. That's it. -I'm scared. -It'll be okay. Ruth, we'll try to get to my place. Don't worry. We'll take you to a safe place. My name is Ivan. -Hi. -Good morning. -Welcome. -Thank you. What's this place? This used to be a slave depository and a hiding place for lovers. When Carnival was forbidden, this became a clandestine samba school depository. We could have our parties and not be disturbed. But today... we call it an Afro-bunker. Check how much water there is and write it down here. Leave me alone, for God's sake. We need patience to get here. Just stay calm, it's okay. Drink this water. Okay. God has a word of faith for you today. Where do I go? Celinha? Celinha! How do you communicate? I need to tell my husband I'm okay. The secret is not communicating, so no one will find us. I need to let my husband know I'm okay. You know we can't be outside. We organize in places like this. Hidden. -So the quilombos will come back? -We prefer Afro-bunker. Quilombo is too 18th century. No one wants to be in hiding, but first we'll take back everything we lost. Even if we have to fight. This is our infirmary. Hi, my name is Capitu. I'm a doctor. Oh my God... That's right, doctor. NGOs won't help anymore. Our struggle didn't start today. It just became more visible. Are you Ms. Elenita, ma'am? Nice to meet you, doctor. Geez, man... You're running out? What now? -How can you go without insulin? -I don't know. -I don't know. -Not inside the apartment. Capitu is not even home. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -We need to save food and water. I agree with you. We need to save everything. Hey... There's something missing. Andre... I'm sorry, I fucked up. I ate it. You know me. I get nervous and I eat. Andre! Antonio! Antonio! Andre! You're going to the streets to go to an Afro-bunker? I saw it in the news. Many melanized are hidden. The hiding places are called Afro-bunkers. Take this cellphone. Relax, take it. I have another one. Be careful. There's a lot of traffic blitz. You must resist. We must exist. -Thank you. -There's more. Hold on. In case you need it. Can you keep it? Please. Capitu is a doctor. They won't arrest doctors. No matter their race, doctors are important, so... Be quiet. And Capitu is smart. Your baby will be fine. -If I were you... -Be quiet! Good evening. -Who's there? -Pedro, it's me. Antonio. Attention, hall 2. I have two melanized here. -I need backup. -Pedro, it's me! -I'm just looking for Capitu. -I don't care who you are! -Fuck! -You're a fool for the government! -Come on, man! -Let's go! -Two melanized are escaping! -Take this! Attention, hall 2... My name is Andre, and this is my cousin Antonio. This video is for the world to see. Life in Brazil is unbearable. We want international entities to listen. Spread this news to everyone. We want... I found you. I knew I'd find some melanized here. -Come on, man. -It just needs to get dark. You think we won't see black people at night. -We don't want trouble. -I always wanted to shoot one. -Now I get to kill two. -Don't! Shut the fuck up! I got it! -Is he alive? -I don't know. -What do we do now? -What do you mean? -Are you crazy? Kill him? -I'm fucking nervous! No, I'm sorry. I won't kill. Not me. -He would've killed us. -Relax, De. Please. If you tell me to relax again, I'll be mad at you. Listen, I'm not like them, okay? We're not like them! Someone has to be better than that! -Look. -Go! Get away from here! Hurry! Run, you piece of shit! It's recording, right? -One day the sun came up so bright. -What the hell? Fuck, the signal is gone. -They cut the signal. -They must have found us. What if we surrender and go to Angola? -Angola? -Yeah! Let's go to Angola! Another batch of high-melanin citizens arrived at the Quatro de Fevereiro Airport. Angola's government supplied food coupons and money to feed the Brazilians who have to deal with the Angolan people who are unhappy with this immigrant wave. In Brazil, an expedition formed by members of many countries came to visit the cities to check if people's rights were respected. It has been eight days, and the operation continues. "BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME" Well, only good news for now. What else? They're focusing on Article 150. This has been discussed. Let them stay. What do you mean? Let them stay there. It's a cost reduction. It's cheaper to collect a dead body than to send them out of the country. -Let them stay. -Okay. LET'S KEEP GOING, FRIENDS. IN THE END, THEY'LL GET NUMB, ADAPT AND FORGET. RENUNCIATION RULES! Inspector. -Are you crazy? Kill him? -I'm fucking nervous. No, I'm sorry. I won't kill him. He would've killed us. Listen, I'm not like them. We're not like them! Someone has to be better than that! -Get away from here! Hurry! -Run, you piece of shit! -You can't go through. -Excuse me, please. -You want to frisk me? -Nobody goes in or out. Go back. Good evening. -Damn it! -Let's go. Fuck! Are you with your mother? Everything will be fine. After drinking that water, I'm a brand new person. -Capitu, could you...? -Can we talk later? CAREFUL! ABORTION PILL How far along are you? What? You know. I'm sorry. It's okay. -Almost two months. -Why? It used to be because I wanted stability. Now there's so much evil in the world. It makes us not want to bring a child into this world. -Do you have children? -I have many children. From here. Your nail polish is peeling off. And your skin is dry. If you could see your skin... Yeah. It's dry. Is it worth giving up? -Every time I think about it... -I'm sorry, sweetie. I need to find some nail polish remover. We need everyone, especially the person inside you. Children bring fear, but they also give purpose. -Can you support our cause? -Can we talk to you? Against this excessive measure. Can you join our cause? We need people like you. We need to do something to fight this measure. It's not fair for people to go through this. Antonio. Read this. I can't, De. "The world heard you. The video you made is out there." It's Kaito. There's a little man with... -So what? -What? It's viral! A lot of people seeing it doesn't mean anything! The internet is a no man's land! "Antonio is being called a pacifying example for not having used the gun." From a total wimp, you turned into a pacifying example in six days! Pacifying? Pacifying? Pacifying my ass! What the fuck do you want? Brazil is mine too! -I was born here! -Shut up, motherfucker! I love this country! It's as much mine as it is yours! Can you hear me? I'll resist! Let's see who can take it longer! Do you want my body? Is that it? So come and get it! -The Minister is coming. -Minister! Sir! Minister! Minister! -Minister, please. -Not now. Isabel Garces. It's a pleasure to meet you. It's a joy to come back to this area that voted for me. The pleasure is all mine. Centro 173 is an example of efficiency in the Return Yourself Now Project. We're here to congratulate you and answer to the people. Thank you so much. I'm just doing my job. We came straight from Salvador. They still have melanized there. You can imagine how hard Bahia is being. We have advanced here, Minister. Do you have chocolate? Minister, please. Just one minute. Minister... I think you've heard about the two melanized in this area. -I know. Andre and... -Antonio and Andre. I think we need to be more vigorous with them. -Look. -You think I don't fucking know? This video is a huge pain in my ass. For Pete's sake... I've cut their power, internet and even water, but they resist. The Africans are very resilient. We don't need a hero to come forward. -Yes! -You have to handle them. No systems are for black people. Only if they serve. But they didn't want to. Inspector. -What is it, Santiago? -I'm leaving. -Leaving? You just got here. -I'm quitting. What? You must be joking! We have a lot of work to do. -You don't understand, Isabel. -What don't I understand? I don't want this anymore. This isn't for me. What isn't for you? Tell me! What isn't for you? This isn't for you? I don't accept your resignation. You'll only leave when it's over. Let go. -Come back. Come back to work! -I won't. Come back! Come back to work! Santiago! You're a coward. You're the worst kind of coward. Brazil won't forgive people like you! Coward! Coward! -How will you get guns? -How do you think, Capitu? -Kidnapping authorities won't work. -That's what I said. They think this country can live without us. The best weapon is to leave and see if they can carry on. That's not a possibility. This country is ours too. We've endured too much. It's what we do. Eva, this is great. We can't kidnap, run away or sing. -We need a middle ground. -What is it? -See how they do it. -What? -We'll do it better! -What? Don't you think we adapted enough to them? The way we walk, talk and behave? -When we ask for the minimum... -They disqualify us. They silence everyone. We've learned a lot from them. Now they need to know we exist. They need to know we exist. Did you fill the water bottles after you drank from them? Antonio, you know how I am. We won't resist very long. And this heat? De! The guard is here. My mouth is dry. What if we remove our melanin? It's Sarah! Sarah! Sarah, baby! RESIST! WE'RE CHEERING FOR YOU! DON'T GIVE UP! -What happened? -Mom! Let's go. -Let me go! -Don't go! Don't yell! I won't harm you. -Get away from her! -Relax! I won't harm you! -Relax! -What do you want with the girl? Hold him! Hold him! -Hold him! -Relax! Relax! A white man! A white man! For the love of God, don't hit him! -He's a spy! -Relax, Gaspar. Relax! -What? He's a spy! Let's get him! -He's not a spy! No? He was hiding back there to turn us in. -He's a spy, Ivan. -I know him. -So? -He's my fucking boyfriend! What? Your boyfriend? -How did he know the entrance? -Boyfriend or not, he's white. Trust me! I know this guy! He's on our side. Ivan. More than anyone here, you know what must be done. There's no need to do this. Let him go, for Christ's sake. It's his fault! -Let's start the vote now. -Wait. Is this a trial? It's a vote to decide if you stay or go. -If we can trust you or not. -You can. Let's do this. Santiago, what's your last name? Evaristo Blanco. That makes sense! Now let's start Blanco's trial. Guys, Santiago is my boyfriend. We don't need this commotion. So what, Ivan? I don't know him. I don't know what he's done. -We can't trust anyone. -You can trust me. -I'm sorry, Blanco. You're white. -Don't start... I'm not in your skin, but I know how you feel. You've been called a monkey? -So white is good, black is bad? -I didn't mean that. What did you mean? That those like you were enslaved and then freed? -I love a black man. -Don't say that! Let me say something. Let me say something. Did they blame your mistakes on your color? It's not my fault what happened! I just want to leave with Ivan! You're a coward! Poor guy! I feel. I feel, I feel! What do you feel, boy? Do you know what it's like to be mistaken for an assistant when you're a doctor? Because she must have felt that. Enough. Enough! Enough! I felt it! I felt it! I know black women are the mules of the world! I feel that all the time! All day long! Many times I was forced to be quiet! But it's not about that now. Santiago... I'm sorry, man, but you need to be quiet, okay? Be quiet and listen. Will there be excesses? Yes, there will. And we... Please, -we need to calm down. -Capitu! It's not that! I'm not asking... It's not that! Calm down, please! No, no! I'm not demanding that anyone be strong. I'm not demanding that we be warriors. They want us to be strong and fight all the time. It's not that. But we must have the right to have doubts. And stop sometimes. And get tired. I'm tired. I'm exhausted from being here. I miss my home. I miss my family. Everyone here is tired. But for us to continue on the right side, we need to do the right thing. We need to call a truce and think of what we can do differently. Let's think about what we can build together. Together! Andre? You better go now. We'll meet later, okay? Remember I love you. -I love you. -Go, go! Wait, wait, wait! Go away! Grab him, man! Relax. I won't do anything. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. -Your partner is a traitor, Ivan. -I'm not a part of it. I quit! One day the sun came up so bright, much brighter than other days. Despite its bright and warm light, people's skin didn't burn. It didn't sting. That light was like an invisible water that showered everyone, and everyone smiled. It showered people's faces, arms, legs. This light penetrated everyone's eyes. It was as if this bright light, instead of blinding people, made them see what they had forgotten. -Come out of the bathroom! -Let me go! -Come with us! -Get off! -Let me go! -I got you. Let me go! Let me go! Let this guy go! Call for help! Call for help! Even if they didn't want to, they remembered the pain. How do we forget pain? How does the soul not bleed? So I decree we must not get used to this daily struggle. And the light would be the water. And people would ask, "What's going on with me? Who am I? What did I not see? Where did we get lost?" And, in that very moment, when everyone was asking the same thing, it was as if we were one. We were many and very different. That's when people's skins became mirrors. Mirrors. "Mirrors that drew every detail in our bodies. Like a fabric that protected us from ourselves." Cousin, I'm sorry! I can't just stand by! At least I need to scream! You know how I am. Don't you? Get him! Let him go! Let me go! Be careful! Be careful! Collect the body. I'm staying. You can't give up! I'll resist. I'm staying here! I have nothing else to lose! You'll have to wake up and face my talent! You'll have to wake up and face my color! And face my doubts and all my humanity! Because this country... Because this country is mine too. We're outside Antonio's apartment who became famous after a video in which he said he'd rather fight with his brain than with a gun. Antonio is also the lawyer who registered injunctions against the Executive Order, to be heard, and it reached the UN. People are gathering. The press is also here. Everyone wants to know what will happen to Antonio. Capitu! Some say, even though they're not sure it's true, that Antonio is the last black man in Brazil. -Capitu. -Yes. This was Santiago's phone. Check this out. I'll resist! Let's see who can take it longer! What the fuck do you want? Do you want my body? Is that it? So come and get it! Pacifying my ass! Fuck! You can go. We'll still be here. We'll never stop. This is ridiculous! It's for you! -He could've killed someone. -You dirtbags! I don't need anything anymore! You can invade the apartment. He's now officially a vandal. Didn't I tell you? The TV is here. Isabel. So? We can invade. Let's see if he'll surrender. It'll be a nicer way to finish our campaign. It's the wife of the melanized. Do we get her? No, no. Not yet. Let them meet. It'll be a pretty image. No violence, Isabel. I don't want heroes here. Capitu! Antonio! Antonio! Capitu! Finally! Come down! Come down, baby! Let's go. Let's get out of here. Hold on. Baby... I missed you so much! Are you okay? Are you okay? Andre, my man. I'm glad everything worked out, Andre. The Brazilian government is on your side. We're here to... I'm Antonio. -My name is Antonio. -You're crazy! The elevators are broken. They haven't worked in two weeks. I need to check that. We are now following the last two high-melanins leaving town. It's a historic moment for our country, which will now be totally white. This has never happened in over 500 years of existence. IN A CULTURE OF DEATH, LIVING IS CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. A thousand nations shaped my face my voice I use it to say what isn't said my country I'm the one who can speak of it "The time has come. The people sing, laugh, pray and cry. At the dawn of a new era. African gods bless the march to holy freedom. They didn't know who they were bringing, the supposedly worthless ones in slave ships. The foreigners were wrong." a thousand nations shaped my face my voice I use it to say what isn't said What are you doing there? Let's go! Get out of the car! Everyone, out! -Clear the way! -Easy! I'm turning around! Easy! I'm not feeling well. I'm sorry. shaped my face my voice I use it to say what isn't said Where are we going? to be happy with futility and sadness is a strength that soothes me my country I'm the one who can speak of it why explore? why destroy? why demand? why coerce? why abuse? why delude? and violate to overwhelm us? why dirty our own home? our country we're the ones who can speak of it my country I'm the one who can speak of it our country we're the ones who can speak of it our country we're the ones who can speak of it
