Susan? Susan, is that you? Did you get my messages? Yes. Yes, I did. Why didn't you call? How are you? It's been a long time. SUSAN: Angela's missing. We need you here. [beeping] I'm sorry, Susan. I'll get back to you. When? When will you get back to me? In a while. I have a call on the other line. Susan, are you still there? Yes. I'm still here. I'll call you back. Roccati. Senor Roccati, [non-english]. [non-english speech] [screaming] [screaming] [coughing] [laughter] Wait for me. Ah! Oh-- Ugh! Come here, quick! Ugh! Where the hell's forensic? I've left messages, sir. Another one! We've found another one! General! [inaudible] Come on! I want every available man up here. Sir? And get me the kids, and the old woman. I want to speak to them myself. Sir, what's a Kurdaitcha man? Who said that? They did. Apparently he's on his way. The Kurdaitcha man is a mythical being. A ghost. A spirit assassin. This water rationing is killing my plants. Air con working yet, love? Flying hot air. Repairmen. Hooligan! Heard from your daughter yet? No, not yet. Poor dear. Love? [horn] [non-english speech] INTERCOM: Current temperatureis 33 degrees Celsius, expected to top out at 42, as a heat wave continues across Australia. On behalf of all the crew, I'd like to thank you for choosing [inaudible]. We hope you enjoyed your flight, and we look forward to seeing you again. - Anything to declare? - No. Nothing. Welcome to Australia. You're going to be bloodyhot in those clothes, mate. Monsignor Jerry? Great. Let me take that for you. Welcome to Australia. Father O'Brien. Ah. Well, you-- you must betired after your long trip. A little bit. Right. It's been like this for over a week. We've got bush fireburning in the mountains. Hey. Hey. A bad performance doesn'tmake you an annual, does it? I'd, uh-- I'd keep keepany valuables on my person. Ah-- things do go missing, if you're not careful. Ah, morning mass at 6:00, church. Showers-- it's just down the hall. Now, the, uh-- it can be a bit tricky. Just give the pipes a bitof a tap if they play at. I'm sorry? Yeah. You'll get the hang of that. And, uh, there's foodand water in the kitchen. Later, perhaps. Thank you. Fine, OK. Well, I'll leave you to settle in. I've got a Gamblers Anonymous meeting. [pipes groaning] [tapping] It's been 12 days since she disappeared. I took that the day she left. So grown up. She looks like you. No, she doesn't. She looks like you. She's wearing the SaintAnthony medal I gave you. Yeah. I gave that to her. What was she doing at the mission? She wanted to see where she was born. I rang Father John, and asked if she could stay. I've been a good mother. I'm sure you have. And then she left. What does Father John say? Nothing. Then what do the police think? They're bloody useless. We've never been apart before. I subscribed to Rome. I've been following your career for 15 years, Monsignor Rogieri. You were always with us. TOMMASO: Aye. My mind was full of memories, too. Does he think about me? Does he think about her? I don't care who my father is. I just want him to put hisarm around me, and hold me. Hug me. I want him to love me, and tell me why he left. Do I laugh like him? Have a seat, Father Rogieri. Rogieri. Monsignor Rogieri. Mrs. Finch has been calling me relentlessly. Every mother of every missing child has called me once or twice. Yes, but Angela-- is anextremely responsible girl. Yes. I've read the case file. Investigated thoroughly. I can assure you that she'sa missing persons case. Nothing to do with homicide. People go missing all the time. Often than not, they prefer it that way. Oh, I'm sure that's not the case with her. Why would she want to hide away? The girl has-- what? A propensity to steal? She stole? She pinched stuff from the mission. Got scared, and took off. The kid'll be home for Christmas. They all get homesick for the fairy lights, and the twinkle twinkle. So, you think it's that simple? [phone ringing] Excuse me. Rosenburg in yet? WOMAN: Yeah. Only just arrived. You'd better get down here. I suppose that you won'tbe working on this case? I mean no disrespect, monsignor, but you just don'tunderstand police procedure. Would you care to walk with me? He picks up young female hitchhikers. All from the same stretch of highway. All within 100kilometers of the forest. Holds them somewhere else. Three weeks, judging by thehealing of the primary wounds. Drugs them, then takes them to the forest, where they're killed. Likes to hunt them like rabbits. Angela doesn't fit the pattern. I don't think he travels that far. The forest is 90 kilometers northeast, and Angela went missing 800kilometers the other way. There's no reason to believe that Angela is involved in this. Susan? Susan. It's sacred ground. Only those who have been through the law should walk around here. Which law? Who are you? [inaudible] did this. Look at all the girls. Our boy is a mythical spirit? You don't know what you're dealing with. He knows something. It's the booze talking. Not some divine fucking knowledge. Look, I was taken away from mymother, too, when I was five. Fostered out to a white Christian family. I never saw her again. But I made it, see? Some don't. You know him? Some time ago, in less social circumstances. I can help you find your daughter. Can you? Take her up north. And see my cousins, aye? On the mission. He's going to sleep outside in the car. I don't know what to do. I think you should stayhere and wait for Angela. She may try to call and come home again. Yes. [engine starting] We've gotta wait for the car to cool off. Should get you some water, mate.You're melting. Water here. Water everywhere. [clattering] I killed a man. That's why the police don't like me. Why? The man killed my brother. This doesn't justify you killing him. It's payback. Tribal law. And does revenge help to heal the wound? [chanting] If anyone thirsts, lethim come to me and drink. For whosoever believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his heartflow rivers of living water. John, 7:37-38. You know the Bible. Grew up in a Christian mission. Read that Bible 100 times. Found no Christianity in that place. Or in that book. Too hot to travel now. First we'll wait for Nauri. Finish the middle of our journey. Nauri? The sun. Nauri lived a long timeago, in a time of darkness. Like you, priest. She carried a bark torch for light. One day, she went out hunting. She left her kid in a cave. Nauri traveled a long way. When she wanted to go back,she realized she was lost. And without knowing it, she stepped off the edge of the world. Now-- now she lights up the world every day, while she stillkeeps looking for her kid. [coughing] Looks like rain. Looks like it, but it never does. The sky can thunder out here for months. No. Over here. BOY: [SINGING] Riding through the snow on a one horse, open sleigh. Jingle, jingle, jingle bell. Na na na na. [sniffle] Riding through the snow. Jingle, jingle, jingle. Corinthian. Yep? Uncle Herbert said that youknow something about that girl, eh? What's that? What? Where did you get this? Where did you get it? Easy. Can you tell me where you got the necklace? [sniffle] You want to blow your nose, Corinthian? Nope. [inaudible] horse. Can you see it? Yep. Qilin. Half horse, half man. The one who couldn't heal himself. You like the Milky Way? Where did you get the necklace, Corinthian? I found it. Where? On the road. She threw it away when she got in the truck. What truck? The real big truck. Angie got in the truck, and tookthe necklace out of the window. Where was this? I don't know. Two or three hours' walk. Maybe more. Six or eight. I've seen that truck a lot. It goes up and down the road all the time. Have you told anyone what you saw? Nobody asked. I'm going up there one day. That's where you go whenyou die, and become a star. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh. We must go to the police. No. The police are trouble. It's the only way to find Angela. We'll find Angela. Just don't go to the police. What are you afraid of? You're not involved. It's the dreams. [phone ringing] [ringing] Yes? Hello, Monsignor. What can I do for you? The girl's life could be at stake. Father, according to you, all we have is the word of a black kid. They've already given us numerous stories. 1,000 trucks go up and downthat road, and half of them give people lifts. But I believe the boy knows what he saw. You should check this story, too. I tell you. OK, Father. We will look into it. We'll do the best we can. Blacks and fucking priests. You all right there, mate? Rome was very pleased with my results. Father John. Many years ago, MonsignorRogieri, a young woman came here. She'd been working with a young priest. But she had to leave his employ. The Catholic Church took very good care of her. The girl was born here. Right here on this mission. I baptized her. The police told me she stole something. We kept a record of herbirth in that filing cabinet. The girl took what was hers, and then she left. We had to hide it from the police, of course. The police ask questions. You may not approve of my methods, Monsignor, but I surely do not approve of yours. You express your concernsvery well, Father John. Thank you. Willie. We need to know whereAngela boarded the truck. We'll go there tomorrow, eh? No. I haven't seen my cousins for a long time. We've got some catching up to do. Uncle Herbert says you will findwhat you need to find tomorrow, so just sit down and wait. No. We have to go now. I'll get the boy. [sigh] Hey, boy. Be seeing you. Yes. Goodbye. Now, boy, we'll be seeing you. [engine starting] [groaning] CORINTHIAN: My dad says theMilky Way is full of campfires. So, where's your collar, Mr. Priest? And where is your father, Corinthian? I think he's in a lock up, my dad. Hm? I think he's a star now, my dad. Pow! Pow! So, are you sure it was here? Yep. This is the place. Good. Tell me what you saw, then. Angie got in the truck, and threw the necklace out of the window. Did you put this paperclip here? Yep. I fixed it. Are you gonna give it back to me? That's the one! Just like that one! That's the one! That's the truck! That's the truck with that she jumped in! Get off the road! Get off the bloody road, you fool! [shouting] [crying, humming] [sobbing] WILLIE: That's one of our constellations. Where? There. I can't see it. You have to look between the stars. The boy's totem. You see, the spirits in the land of the dead can see which sacred clan he belongs to. [blowing air] From this day on, we must never speak the boy's name again. This will tell us where the killer is. [heavy breathing] [animal screeching] [groaning] [coughing] [gasping] [coughing] You suck on this. You suck on it. There's water in there. [coughing] So-- you know now where Angela is? Want to bless this boy for your Christian god? [praying] [coughing] We must walk this way! Gotta follow the flies. Who's that? Kurdaitcha. Spirit. Sent to kill. What is this feather? Revenge. More bloodshed? Is your way any better? Yes. Forgiveness. Is that what you need? No god can forgive you ifyou can't forgive yourself. [flies buzzing] [coughing] Jesus Christ. Fucking black bastard! [heavy breathing] WILLIE: We'll fix it, OK? Should get you some water, mate. We must keep going. No. You wait here. I come with you. I come with you. Wait for me. Willie! Ah! Don't leave me here alone! You're not alone! [whimpering] You dog. [gunshot] [gasping] Get the gun. [clicking] Let's go. We've set up roadblocks. We're doing everything we can to find Angela. What do you intend to do with the body? He needs a proper burial. According to his customs. [praying] We need the body for our procedures. I don't think it would be appropriate. [mournful prayer chants] There's a vehicle outside. Wait until dark. [mournful prayer chants] [engine starting] [chanting] [shouting] Ah! Ah! [hissing] You-- [screaming] [gasp] [brakes squealing] [engine revving] [crashing] [explosion] [grunting] [grunting] [crying] The key! The key! WOMAN: Looks like self defense. Yeah. Looks like self defense. [sigh] [children playing] [non-english speech] [music playing]
