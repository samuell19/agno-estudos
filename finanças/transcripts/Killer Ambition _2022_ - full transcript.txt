I bet I'd make it to the water first. As long as your clothes are off before you do. This way. Come on. Let's go this way. - Here. - My turn. Oh, my god. - Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my gosh. - Oh, my god. - Corey. - Wow. Sylvia, that is gorgeous. Is that part of lush designs' new line? Luke is upgrading Claire's engagement ring for their tenth anniversary. This'll be one of a kind. Her original ring was my first commission. That's where I got my start. From there, it was word of mouth. And now your designs are sold nationwide. Some days it still feels unreal. Well... It's getting late. Aren't you and Bruce going to a concert? Oh, yeah. I've really gotta go. - Um, you okay to lock up? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes. Go. Have fun. - Ooh! Sorry. - Oh! No. Uh... Excuse me, I should have been watching where I was going. Jesse! I wasn't expecting you today. Are you here for the design specifications? Well, yeah, I wanted to make sure that the gemstones we're sourcing you are exactly what you need. - Mm. - Mm. Corey, is there something else? Mn-mn. Oh. Do you have that effect on everyone? That effect? That's an occupational hazard for being a diamond broker. Everyone loves diamonds. - Hm. I don't think that's it. - Mm. I've seen more than one person try and hit on you. Oh, really? Are you jealous? I don't do jealous. Why are you here? Well, officially, to get the specs... - Mm-hmm. - Unofficially... - We agreed to be discreet. - Everyone's gone home. It doesn't get more discreet. What about security? Because of the design leaks, we've added more cameras. You put security cameras in your office? Not in my office. Kat. There's something I need you to do for me. Ooh, that's Sylvia Stafford from lush designs. Make sure she's there. We need her in our little group. Well, there-there isn't much time. I don't know if I could... Russo. Help Kat get Ms. Stafford to our next meeting. Certainly. - It's settled. - Yeah. Okay. - Hi, Sylvia! - Claire. Uh... I was afraid you were gonna cancel. Oh, I was, too. Nathan is teething. And I could barely get dressed by the time the nanny got there. It was crazy. What are you working on? It's just a new design for lush. - Let me see. - It's really rough. Oh, my gosh, what is that? - What? Oh, Claire! Claire, no. - So easy! These are the kids' birthstones. Is this for me? Luke asked me to design you a more lavish engagement ring. Syl, this is beautiful. I love it! But I am mad at you for ruining the surprise. You-your-your article comes out in the newspaper tomorrow. - Are you nervous? - A little. They asked me so many questions, I can hardly remember them all. But I think it'll be good. Did they ask about your love life? No, it's for the business section, so we talked business. Boring. Okay, well, then I will ask because Luke has this friend Noah. - He is perfect... - I'm seeing someone. You are? That's great! When do I get to meet him? Are you excited about your anniversary trip? Yeah, but you're not gonna dodge my question. - I wanna know about this guy. - There's nothing to tell. It's still really early, and we're trying to keep a low profile. - What's with the look? - Nothing. I just hope that you're gonna find the right guy. I mean, for someone who designs wedding rings, you seem kind of opposed to marriage. I'm not opposed to marriage, just not sure I'll ever find what you and Luke have. My mom, uh, was beautiful, talented, funny. And she ended up in a miserable marriage. Well, you're not your mom, and it's gonna happen for you at the right time and it's gonna be great. - You're the best. - I know. Well, you moved on quickly. I don't see how that's any of your business. You're right, it's not. So what am I doing here, Becca? To tell me how you plan to pay me back for what you cost my business. I don't owe you anything. Other people may be willing to let you off the hook. I'm not. I had some friends do some digging, and, oh, they found some very interesting business ventures you're involved in. I don't know what you're talking about. Stop wasting my time. - I'll be in touch, Jesse. - Can't wait. Hello? Hello? Oh, thank you! You didn't have to get me a coffee. Mm. Do I look that bad? Hm, not at all. I was already getting one for myself. You're a terrible liar. I hardly slept last night. I kept getting anonymous calls with no one there. - Did you block the number? - Yeah. And then it'd happen again with a different number. Yeah, well, you really do need to be careful now that you're in the public eye. I finally just shut off my phone so I could get some sleep. Oh, my gosh, Corey. Sorry, uh, I was just playing around. - Here, I'll put it back. - No, no, no, no. I... I like it. You have a real eye. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Oh! I almost forgot. Special delivery. Mm? Mm. I've got invited to join the females in leadership society. I can't believe it. I can't believe it either. - Hm. - Hm. - Mm-hmm. - Have you read the article? I was too afraid to even buy a copy. Uh, I figured that. But I will say... This is a lovely spread in the society section. What? Uh... "Every woman should sparkle like a star." I never said that. T-This-this was supposed to be a business article. Yeah, but the society section makes sense. When people think lush designs, they think glamor. And almost every celebrity wears your jewelry. "She overcame a series of personal tragedies at an early age." Listen, I don't know what the problem is, I'd love to have this kind of publicity for my business. I built lush designs from the ground up. I thought I was being recognized for that. Well, I understand that, but the part w-where you're being honest about your father... Okay, that was off the record. Well, apparently, it was on the record. It's right there. "Speaking of her estranged father, Sylvia admitted a part of her will always miss him." - What are you doing? - I'm calling that reporter. I'm not gonna let this go. No, no, we are not. - Come on. - Why? - Give me the phone. - Why? Give me the phone. You're not gonna call them tonight. You can call them tomorrow. Why? Because I need time to decide or... Definitely or. This is nice. Mm-hmm. Hey, I'm really sorry that the article wasn't what you were expecting. Well, maybe you're right. I should just enjoy the publicity. Hey, I'm just curious. When was the last time you saw your dad? Hm. When I was 18. The last time I saw him, he was kicking me out of his house. Wow. And how can you still have feelings for him after something like that? Well... I remember what he was like when I was little. I thought I had the best dad in the world. I was a total daddy's girl. My mom and I just adored him. That's the dad I miss, not the bitter person he became when he started drinking. Hey. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get too personal. I guess it's impossible to always keep things casual, huh? Hm. God. Look what I got today. What's this? "Females in leadership." It's a group of highly successful women. Ah, yeah, or a group that preys on highly successful women. Seriously, I hear people join these just to troll the competition. - Fil has a very good reputation. - Yeah, the powerful often do. All right, don't join. It's almost 12:00, and that's the deadline anyway. How about let's go for round two? I still have time to finish. Hello? Whoever this is, stop calling me. Sylvia, this is Kat from Fil. The Fil? What-what time is it? There's a meeting today. You're expected to attend. - I'll send details later. - Today? I don't know if... Look, if you wanna join, you'll be there. Corey. I didn't know you designed. I doodle a little. This is more than doodling. You have real talent. - You think? - Definitely. - May I? - Yeah. I'd love to see more of your designs. Yeah, of course. Yeah. I'll be out the rest of the day, but call me if you need me. Yeah, I've got things here. Sylvia. Oh, my... Dad... Earl. It's, um, it's been a long time. - You saw the article. - Heck, yeah. - I'm proud of my baby girl. - Why are you here? Well, I just, I thought maybe... Well, you just thought that maybe we could be a family again? Did you come here because of what they quoted me saying about you? Did they misquote you when you said you miss me? Look, I know I don't deserve a second chance. I just wanted to talk. I'm busy, Earl. All right, please, don't, don't go off like that. I'll do what I want. Look. I'm glad you've gotten yourself together, but don't you show up here expecting a pat on the back from me. I'm-I'm sorry, I-I guess I expected too much too soon. You know, I read the article, I just, I thought... I'm sorry, Sylvia. And I'm not, I'm not gonna bother you again. Wait. Call my office and make an appointment with my assistant. An appointment? Thank you, baby girl. You should go. You know, you, um, you have your mother's smile. God, I loved her smile. Then why did you always make her cry? Do you mind coming with me? No! No! No! Come on! Where are we? All your questions will be answered shortly. Please allow me to apologize again, Ms. Stafford. I thought I was gonna die! Oh, is there a problem? - Kidnapping? - Oh. I apologize if our initiation tactics made you uncomfortable, but our number-one rule at Fil is secrecy. If that's so important, then why was the address on the invitation? Oh, that's a fake. So secrecy, just not honesty. Okay. On the contrary, we now keep our society under lock and key after a potential member released footage from a meeting, along with a few of our cutting-edge ideas. It put the Fil in a very vulnerable state. Well, no harm was done, though. - He scared me. - Oh. Don't get me wrong. Russo has always scared me a little. Uh, thank you, Russo. Buh-bye. Well, now that that's all cleared up, let me take you to meet Elizabeth. - Elizabeth? - Oh, the head of Fil. This is her home. So put that away. Shall we? Elizabeth is impatient to meet you. - Please. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. So Fil board meetings are anything but typical. We're dead serious when it comes to business, though, so... Oh, here's Elizabeth now. Welcome to my home. Elizabeth Collins, I'd like to introduce Sylvia Stafford. I've been looking forward to meeting you, Sylvia. Thank you. I was so thrilled to be invited. It looks like we're going to have to speak later. I have some business to attend to if you'll excuse me. Will you introduce Sylvia to the others? - Of course. - Hm. Well, I guess I'll start the introductions with myself. I'm sorry if we got off on the wrong foot earlier. I'm Kat. Kat cosmetics is my beauty line. Maybe you've heard of it? Who hasn't? I use all your stuff. Your eyeliners are the absolute best. Really? Oh. Thank you. Maybe we can work out a deal. Some of your beauty for some of my bling? Well, look at you. I like the way you think. Oh. There's Vanessa. You've got to meet her. And that's Becca, in black. She has to be the center of attention. In her mind, we're all part of the Becca show. - Hi! - Kat! Elizabeth said you were outside greeting our newest member. Yes, that's right, uh, Vanessa, Becca, I'd like to introduce Sylvia Stafford, owner of lush designs. Becca owns several fashion lines. A-Are you Becca brown? I am. Lush designs often uses your clothes in our ads. - They are so beautiful. - Thank you. Uh, would you consider a joint media campaign? I'd love for lush designs to have your official endorsement. That's certainly an interesting idea. I'll consider it. Oh! I love when pleasure becomes business. And meet Vanessa, creator of the hottest social-media app out there, ignite. Of course. "Ignite your passion." When you join, we'll add you to the Fil group. It's how we all keep in touch. Oh, maybe Vanessa has some ideas for your proposed collaboration. Ah. Looks like we have some catching up to do! - Are you and Thomas... ah! - Engaged! Yes. I couldn't believe when he surprised me with this sparkler. - Do you love it? - Oh, of course. I'd recognize a lush design anywhere. There's no mistaking your touch, Sylvia... Wow. It looks so familiar. Uh, yeah, I mean, I-I love your designs, Sylvia, but, uh, this is actually by someone else. They're so new, I don't even remember the name. Yeah. Well, if you'll excuse me, I will be right back. Yes. Well, that went well. What do we think? She needs to go through the process, of course. Well, obviously. Hi, Jesse. Well, aside from being practically kidnapped... I'll tell you later. Listen, something else happened that was really weird, Jesse. Oh, my god. I gotta let you go. I'll talk to you later, okay? Better not let Elizabeth catch you. - Right. I know, right. - Work call? Uh, sorry, it's, it's really none of my business. I wanted to talk to you alone. I have a business proposal. Kat sure wasn't kidding about the Fil and business. - What did you have in mind? - Well... Last year I developed an app that I think would be perfect for lush designs. You know what, we've been concentrating so much on our physical stores, our online presence has suffered. Well, with my app your customers would not only be able to try on the designs virtually, but they could explore possible modifications. With your designs, my app will practically allow the jewelry to sell itself. I like the sound of that. To be continued. There you are! Hi. I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to speak further. Oh, thank you. I'd love to learn more about the Fil. It's an impressive group that supports so many wonderful charities. I'd be honored to join these amazing women. That's wonderful, there are a few more formalities to attend to, but I believe you're a perfect fit for the Fil. Everyone seemed to enjoy meeting you, including Becca, and that's no small feat. I'll be in touch this week. If all goes as I believe it will, we'll announce you formally on the yacht excursion this weekend. - Yacht excursion? - Is there a problem? - No. - I didn't think so. Lovely meeting you. Excuse me. Helen! What the... If she discovers anything else missing, have her contact me. My number's on the card I gave her. Okay. Thank you very much, officer. Are you okay? No. Hey. Don't worry. They're gonna get the guy. They're gonna get the jewelry back. It's not about the jewels. Having the police here brought back so many memories. How helpless I felt when my mother died. - Come here. - And everything's a mess. - What, here? - Yeah. Don't... Do not, do not even worry about it, okay? I'm gonna clean all this up. Oh. I thought you'd gone. No, of course not. I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye. - Aww. - Here, I made some coffee. - Thanks for opening the door. - Oh, you're welcome. Well, how did you sleep last night? Very well. Thank you for staying. Of course. My pleasure. You know if you'd like, uh, I could stay a few more nights. Thank you, Jesse, really, oh, but I'm not sure we're quite ready for that just yet. Okay. But just so you know, whenever you are ready, I'm here, okay? You should've called me. I wasn't alone. Yeah, I'm glad. Something else happened yesterday. - Earl showed up. - What? - I know. - He... When I read the article, I knew he was gonna come crawling back. I hope you kicked his sorry butt to the curb. How can you even think about talking to him? It's hard to explain. After your mom died, you were convinced he had something to do with it. I never told you this, but mom and I fought that day about me spending the night at your house. I was so mad at her, I wouldn't even listen to her. And I said things that I still regret. Later I snuck out while she and Earl were arguing. Syl, I don't, I don't see how... When I got home the next morning, Earl told me she was mad I left. She took off and he didn't know where she was. I should've stayed home. Maybe things would've been different, maybe she wouldn't have gone out on that boat alone. Syl, you know that you are not to blame. I know. But I realized it, it just, it wasn't fair for me to blame Earl either. Mom loved sailing. She said it cleared her mind. It was an accident. Do you really believe that? You know, Vanessa, I’m very excited about your app. It just, it seems tailor-made for lush designs and it shows a real understanding of jewelry design. Mm-hmm, I was hoping you'd feel that way. I... It must've taken you a long time. It's hard to believe you developed it without negotiating a deal first. Truth is, it was originally developed for a different type of business, but thanks to my soon-to-be ex, a gemstone dealer, I realized it could be adapted perfectly for jewelry design. Is there any chance he could claim? No, thanks to a rock-solid Prenup, my lawyer says that our split will be swift and equitable. The app is mine. - You must have a good lawyer. - Yes. I am so glad that I took her advice. Now, about the app... I think we have a deal, what do you say we head back to my office and iron out the details, hm? Ooh. - Uh... - Oh, yeah. Hi, Ronnie. Uh, no, not for a bit. Whoa, slow down. O-Okay. Yeah. Sure, I'll be there in a minute. I'm sorry, I need to head back to the office. No problem. I'll have Corey call to reschedule. Great, uh, if you wanna send over some sample designs, I'll add it to the app for you to try. Perfect. Um, Sylvia, there is something that you need to know before we sign any contracts. Sounds serious. It could be if I'm not upfront with you. Um, my ex is Jesse Reynolds. I believe you know him. Yes, he supplies a lot of our jewels for lush designs. I think you know him a little better than that. Trust me, I don't need any details. I just wanna be straight with you. Yup. Okay, talk soon. - Hello? - It's Becca brown. - Oh, hi, Becca, how are you? - Wonderful, as always. Uh, so... Listen, I'm gonna be near your office tomorrow, so I thought I'd stop by at 2:00 and we can discuss our joint media campaign. Well, I actually have a previous commitment, Becca... I'll see you then. Oh, okay. All right. That was surprise. Are you crazy? Why would you scare me like that? You told me you had plans tonight. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry. I had a long day today. Okay, come here. Hm. Hey. Guess what? I got you gino's, your favorite. Then we shouldn't let it get cold. You're not eating. Is something wrong with your food? No, it's good. Hey. Something is on your mind. Come on, I wanna, I wanna know what you're thinking. You can talk to me, come on. I wanna know everything about you. You already do. It's all out there for anyone to read. I just realized today I don't know anything about you. I'll tell you whatever you wanna know. Is your divorce final? Uh, well, I... Who told you that? You told me your marriage was over. You told me your divorce was final. Yeah. Who have you been talking to? Why won't you answer my question? Uh, because it's, it's complicated, okay? And, uh, yes, our marriage ended a long time ago. We're now just finally making it official, but she's fighting it. - Vanessa's fighting it? - Yeah. - That's not what I heard. - From who? Someone at the Fil? All right, you know, just be careful who you trust there. I warned you about them. This-this is why you didn't want me to join the Fil. You didn't want Vanessa finding out about us. Does she know? Did you tell her about it? Because we agreed to keep this quiet. I thought we were separating business from pleasure. I didn't realize you were just protecting yourself. Are you worried about the settlement from your divorce or the, getting the app? What do you know about the app? I just spent the entire afternoon negotiating with your soon-to-be ex-wife about using it for lush designs. Well, I hate to break it to you, but Vanessa is a liar. How do you think she's gotten so far? And this is how you treat me after I do something really nice for you? Thanks. This is Jesse. Leave a message. Jesse, we have some things we need to discuss. Latte with two sugars. You remembered. I prefer it black now, though, so... - Oh, I-I-I didn't know. - How would you? You abandoned me over a decade ago. You know, you say that like you were a child. You were a legal adult, Sylvia. I was a confused high-schooler. I'd just lost the most important person in my life. So had I. Look, I'm sorry that I wasn't stronger, and I'm sorry that I took to drinking. You started drinking long before mom died. It just got worse after. Yeah, well, you know, I got lots of regrets. I'm just grateful that my weakness didn't affect you. You think because I'm successful that your weakness didn't affect me? Your weakness affected every decision of my life, every relationship I've ever been in. Because of you, it's still hard for me to trust anybody besides Claire... Who knows where I'd be if it hadn't been for her family! I'm-I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. Did you even care where I was? If I was safe? Of course I did. Look, when I got my life together, I wanted to see you. I missed you. You know, when I read that article in the paper about your past, I thought you understood the demons that I was fighting back then. I mean, that article gave me hope that, that we could reconnect. I just wanna be a part of your life again. - That'll take some time. - Yeah. And I need to know the truth about mom. What happened between you two? She was acting strange that day. I wanted to blame you because I'd heard you fighting, and you wouldn't even explain afterwards. Truth can be a tricky thing, Sylvia. It's not always easy to hear. Why did she go out on that boat so upset? Was it really because of me? Look, I didn't wanna say anything then. You idolized your mother. You... Oh, god. Your mother was, um... Your-your mother had an affair. She loved you. She wouldn't let either of us give up on you. She would never have done that. - Who was it? - Does it matter? Yes. It matters to me. I need to know all of it to understand. He worked with her. You didn't know him. I promise not to withhold the truth from you again. All this, this is a lot. Yeah, I know it is, baby girl. I know. You didn't have to see me back to my office, but thanks. Well, I didn't want you to be alone. That was quite a bombshell I dropped on you. I'm still having trouble believing it. I understand. Hey, look, I'm here for you now, baby girl. I'm-I'm not ready to forgive and forget. Just, just talk. Sorry, absolutely. Sylvia. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting this... Becca, you're early. I believe if you're not five minutes early, you're late. You-you seem so familiar. Have we met before? I don't know. Have we? My name's Earl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Becca brown. You know, I never forget a handsome face. Well, I'm sure I'll remember. If you'll excuse us, we have a meeting. Certainly. Uh, we'll talk soon. Becca brown, it was a pleasure meeting you. Hm. Well, I think he's a little too old for you, Sylvia, but he's very charming. Becca, Earl's my father. Hm. Do we have a deal? You've convinced me, I think the joint media campaign is a brilliant idea. I'm glad. I'm very excited to work with you. Thank you. Oh, so beautiful. Who, uh, sources your jewels? Jesse Reynolds. Do you know him? Unfortunately. He's married to a friend of mine. They're going through a nasty divorce. Apparently, Jesse's business relies on funding from my friend. Be careful that his troubles don't become your troubles. Hm? Send over the contracts. I'll have my lawyers review them. Oh. I'll see myself out. Wait, did the deal fall through? No, she loved the concept. Okay, that's great. But why did you both look so... Corey, could you have head of security come to my office? Yeah. I'll call him now. Captain spinks will have the champagne chilled and ready to pour when we arrive at the boat on Saturday. And what time do we set sail? I had to give my invitation to Sylvia, and I haven't written it down. Well, I didn't send one to her because I thought we were discussing her membership today. My mistake. How did your meeting go with Sylvia? Oh, you know, everything seems to be in order. I think she has a lot to offer the Fil. Excellent. - And I even met her father. - Oh! I thought Sylvia and her father were estranged. That's what I read, you know, if I were her, I wouldn't wanna see him again. I found her father perfectly charming. Charming or handsome? You've been known to confuse good looks for a winning personality, and they haven't all proven to be winners. I don't care for what you're insinuating. I mean, he was my type. And I think I've met him before. And once I figure it out, I intend to rekindle whatever fire we had between us. Just do me a favor and look before you leap this time. With your taste in men, you should do a background check before you get involved. Send Sylvia her invitation. We will be announcing the newest member of the Fil Saturday, on the boat. I'm excited Sylvia's joining. Aren't you, Becca? - What's wrong, Becca? - Hm? Oh, no, nothing. I was just thinking that maybe Elizabeth is right, and maybe I should have my people do some research on Earl Stafford, get an edge on the competition. - Bye, Becca. - You think I'm kidding? - I'm just saying. - I think it's a brilliant idea. - Of course you do. - What? I can't believe I didn't think about it before. You sure you're okay, 'cause Luke and I can go another weekend. No, no, no, no. You guys need this. I'm fine, I actually, uh, have plans with the Fil this weekend. Oh, do tell. Where are they kidnapping you to next? This time I will be driving myself. We're going to the Marina for a boat excursion. - And you're okay with that? - I'm a little nervous. But they promised the champagne will be flowing, and I think I'll need it when this week is over. Yeah, it's been a rough one. It's not over yet. I'm ending things with Jesse. - It's Jesse? Jesse? Okay. - Mm-hmm. I get why you didn't wanna tell me. Mm-hmm. Syl, I'm sorry. Come here. You're gonna be okay. God, I don't know what I'd do without you. Dad? Oh, hey, Sylvia. Happy 18th. Happy 18th. You got no idea how long I've been waiting for this day. You know, I've been thinking, I think it's time that you, uh, spread your wings, fly, fly! Packed your bags for ya. Dad, what's this all about? It's about you talking behind my back to that little friend of yours, Claire, yeah, for months, saying I had something to do with your mother's death! Your mother's death! I wasn't even on the boat. You're an adult now, so you take your suspicions and you get out! - Get out! - I don't have any money, dad. Oh, gee, what a coinkydink. Neither do I. You've been like an anvil around my neck. I can't wait to get rid of you and be free! You got a problem with that? You take it up with her. Now get out! Let me finish the outline. - But it tickles. - Okay, I'm done. Now let's design you a ring. I want a heart, because you are my heart. Mom, so lame. Love is not lame. I love you, Sylvia. I love you, too, mom. What? What's this? Mom, who is this? - Good morning, you. - Oh, good morning. - Here you go. Of course. - Oh, thank you. - What's this? - Oh. It's my sketchbook from high school. I was drawing jewelry long before I dreamed about starting lush designs. Take a look. Thanks. You know, I thought about you calling your designs doodles. They can be so much more if you want. This could literally be in lush designs' next catalog. Oh, wow. Claire would love this one. You've always been so talented. I see the same kind of talent in you. I'd like to help you if you'll let me. - Yeah? Uh-huh? - Mm-hmm. Thank you. I'd like that. Uh, Corey, what do you know about DNA testing? What? You think Jesse's someone's baby daddy? What? No why would you bring up Jesse? Oh, my god! Come on! We both know you have something going on. - No. - Don't deny it. - I... - Look. If Jesse thins he's someone's father, I think he just needs to work that out for himself. Well, he's not the one. Oh. Oh, so you think he's the father? Uh, the same thing happened to my brother. His ex-girlfriend claims that he was the father of her child. - What did he do? - Well... He snatched the kid's bottle and gave it to me and I gave it to my friend that works in a lab. - Did that work? - Yeah. Turns out he wasn't the father. Do you think your friend would help me? Oh, yeah. She's a big fan of yours. Look, don't worry about it. I got you, okay? - Thank you. - Of course. Hi, dad. Um, can you meet today? Hi, I'm here to see Sylvia. - Yeah, of course, follow me. - Thank you. Right this way. Ms. Stafford will see you now. - Thank you. - Of course. - Hi. - Hi. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Um, before we start, I have to ask. How did you know Jesse and I were dating? I heard you on the phone at the party. Hm. I... I know we planned to finalize our agreement today, but I-I have to ask you a couple of questions about Jesse. I... you haven't heard about Becca? - What happened to Becca? - Um... Becca died in her sleep last night. - What? - Her assistant found her. Um... They think it may have been a, a heart attack. I... Thank you. She seemed like quite the force. Hm. She was. Right now she'd just be telling me to stop blubbering and get down to business. Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait. - We can reschedule. - No. Oh, no. I wanna talk about this now. Um, you seemed upset earlier. Let me guess. Jesse told you the app was his? He exploded when I told him lush designs would be using it. I haven't talked to him since. He's not answering my calls. Mm, typical Jesse. I don't play games. Not in my personal life or in business. Is the app yours or Jesse's? Remember when I told you I initially created the app for a different type of product? Well, I intended it for Becca to use for her accessory lines. Scarves, hats, sunglasses. Imagine my surprise when my assistant showed me an almost identical app in the app store. I mean, it was so similar to Becca's, it couldn't have been a coincidence. I must've looked like you when you saw Kat's ring at Fil. You knew the design was mine. I told you, I'm a fan. I saw your reaction and I knew something was up with the ring. And then later, whenever I heard you talking to Jesse, it was clear to me what happened. So you think Jesse stole my design for Claire? Don't you? I'm glad you could make it. I didn't think you'd call me so soon. I hope that meeting of yours yesterday went well. You sure know some impressive people. Hey, did that, that lovely lady, did she remember me? - No, she-she didn't. - Oh. Um, I doubt Becca really knew you. You two didn't exactly run in the same social circles. Didn't? - Join. - Oh, sure. Oh... Um, Becca died in her sleep last night. Oh, my. Uh, I am sorry to hear that. I was just getting to know her, but a lot of people will miss her. Thanks for being so patient with me. I never expected to see you again, dad. I needed a little time to get used to the idea of you being back in my life. Dad. I didn't think I'd hear you call me that again. I'm trying. Honestly, I'm still pretty upset to learn mom was cheating on you. I never should've told you that. No, I’m-I'm glad you told me. I wanted the truth. Just may take a while for me to accept it. Of course, yeah. I-I'm just, I'm just so happy that I'm in your life again. - We'll see. - Okay. I should get back to the office. - So soon? - Yeah. I have a busy day ahead of me. - Okay. - Um... I can take that if you're finished. Oh, uh, thank you. Sure, yeah. Of course. So you, uh, you remember, when you were a kid, we used to come here and you'd catch tadpoles? - Yeah. - Get the fireflies at night? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, do you, uh, do you suppose your old man could get just one hug? Hm. Sure. Oh. - It was good seein' you. Okay. - Okay. Yeah. - I'll see you later. - All right. - Drive carefully. - Yeah. Hey, there you are. - Fresh from the printer. - Ooh. Oh, these look great, thank you for picking them up on your lunch hour. Yeah, anytime, the printer was right next door to my favorite deli, who, by the way, have the best cookies. - You're too good to me. - Yeah, that's probably true. Oh, um, Corey, remember what we were talking about earlier? - Jessie's kid? - Yes. Um, so I met up with, um, Jesse and I took the cup he was drinking out of, and, um, I was wondering if maybe you could... - Give it to my friend? - Yeah. - Yeah, I can do that. - Thank you. God, you move fast. But, you know, I'm gonna need something from the kid as well. - Oh, that's the easy part. - Get it, girl. So, wait, how old is this kid, anyway? 'Cause you gotta think about what you're getting yourself into, like, are we talking about homework or diapers or... What, am I jumping too far ahead? No, no, that's not it. I-I-I can't find the cup. - It's gone. - What do you mean? Well, where did you have it? Did you actually get it? - It's been a long day, Jesse. - Ah. - Well, hi. - What are you doing here? I'm sorry, can we talk? I have to go grab something. I'll be right back. I'll be here. Jesse. What's this? Stuff you left here. I got it all together. Well... Babe, l-let's just leave it here for the next time I come over. There's not gonna be a next time, Jesse. We're done. Sylvia, you can't mean that. Come on. Over a misunderstanding? It was just a little lovers'... It was more than that, and you know it. You lied to me. Yeah, babe, why don't we just sit down and talk about it? It's-it's nothing we can't get past, and I know you've also been really stressed with your dad just showing up out of the blue, and Vanessa... Let's-let's talk about Vanessa. I-I wanna... She warned me you would play this kind of game. She's a smart woman. I can't believe she put up with stuff like this. Wow, okay, so that's what's going on. She, uh, she poisoned you against me. - No. I can think for myself. - Really? But she told me about her experiences with you, and I realized we had a lot in common. You have nothing in common. Believe me, you are one of a kind, and what you and I... Oh, god, stop! Well, it's over! - Personally and professionally! - What does that mean? It means I'm terminating your contracts with lush designs. You can't do that. My legal team is already on it. You can't, you can't do that. You can't do that! You can't! Whatever you think has gone wrong between you and I has nothing to do with business, I supply lush designs with the highest-quality jewels on the market! You are unbelievable. Everything you just did I have on camera. Take a look. - That's not what it looks like. - Hm. I was taking those so that I could start outsourcing stones for you. Hm. - How dedicated you are, Jesse. - Thank you. I spoke to my head of security yesterday. He's been reviewing our security measures and believes the breeches came from outside of lush designs. I just got the proof. Sylvia, just, please, let me explain... What is there to explain, Jesse? How you stole from lush designs or how you broke in to my home? - I didn't break into your home. - Oh, save it. Get out or I'm calling the police. You wouldn't. Oh, I would. Oh, honey, I would. Fine. Fine. Oh, and just so you know, I’m not gonna let you trash my name. Your name isn't worth trashing. Mm. So I'm assuming Jesse talked to you? Oh... - Yes, he called. - Mm. - And he was furious. - Hm? Can you believe he blamed me for everything? Yes, I can. - I'm sorry. - Oh, I'm not. - It's nice of you to come over. - Yeah. Well, I guess I didn't really have to worry about you. I am embarrassed to admit that... Despite Jesse's many betrayals, I fell apart when we split up. Aww. Things were different for you. You two were married. Honestly, I went into my relationship with him like all my others, looking for a way out. We are opposites then, I always run in, head-first, sure that this guy is the one. - Wish I could be like that. - Oh, no. It's lonely not letting anyone get too close. Well, maybe we can help each other. You keep me from diving in too fast and I'll keep you from running away. - I'll drink to that. Cheers. - Yeah. I can't believe we ate it all. Well, it had to be done. - I better get going. - You're welcome to stay. Oh, that's sweet, but I really oughta go. Please stay? I'm nervous about the boat trip tomorrow. I-I don't like boats. Do you get motion sickness? I have an extra wristband. No, it's not that, I... I spent a lot of time on boats as a kid and I used to love it, but not anymore. Okay. I'll stay. You are an angel. I'll need some more wine, though. - Please? - Yes, ma'am. Hey, captain spinks. - How you doin'? - Jesse. Hey, I'm surprised to see you here today. Last I heard, you and your wife were about to get a... Yeah, we're getting a divorce. We are, we are. I just wanna give these, though, to my girlfriend. We... We just had a little bit of a misunderstanding. Girlfriend? Best I can do is give these to her for you. - Which of the ladies? - Well... Her name is Sylvia Stafford, but I'd really like to give 'em to her myself. I don't want a scene today, Jesse. Okay. - Oh! Morning. - Oh. Good morning. Oh! - This is for you. - Thank you. - Would you like some coffee? - Yes, please. Oh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yes, thank you. - You okay? - Hm. Jesse sent me a text. He wants to see me tonight. He wants to make things right. Mm. Well, he doesn't give up easy. He was pretty freaked out when he found out you were getting your lawyers involved. Just ignore him, okay? - You're right. Mm. - Is that it? Did you get a message from the boat's captain this morning? Captain spinks? No. My phone died. What'd he say? They pushed up the launch because of the weather. Um, they want us back before it gets too rough. Are you sure you're okay? Not really, I was already nervous, and, uh, now there's a chance of bad weather. So? What? I have too many bad memories. My mother died on a boat when I was a kid. Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. This'll be the first time I've been on a boat since then. Well, I'll be right there with you today, okay? I really appreciate it. I got you. You're gonna be okay. Hello? Ladies? Captain spinks? Huh. - You good? - Yeah. Are you sure you got the time right? Captain spinks usually meets us with champagne as we board. I think so. Should we call Elizabeth? Hello? Maybe they rescheduled, somewhere on land. Or maybe they're just downstairs. Listen, I know you're nervous, but you are gonna have a great time. - Okay? Yeah? - Okay. Mm. Yeah. You're gonna be okay? I'm sorry, I think I may need to lie down for a minute. Of course. Don't apologize, okay? Follow me. Slowly. Careful. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Breathe. It's okay. All right, here you go. Bathroom's right in there, okay? - Um, thank you. I appreciate it. - Of course. Just don't hibernate in here too long, okay? - Deal. - I'll get the champagne ready. Vanessa? Are you okay? Hello? Let me out! Open this door! Jesse. Jesse, Jesse. Are you okay? Hang on, Jesse, I'll get help. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Please. Please, please, please. Come on. Sylvia. Sylvia. Are you okay? Get my phone, it's under the couch. There's no service here. He's coming. Well, you look snug as a bug in a rug. Well, we're just about to, uh, depart, so I'm gonna go let our other passenger know. She is gonna be so surprised to see daddy. He's your father? Long story. I'll be right back. Please be careful. Now, where did you go? Well, at least you're still there. Now, where's she hidin'? Not gonna tell me? It's all right. I'll find her myself. Sylvia! - Did you call for help? - I couldn't. - He smashed the radio. - Hand me my phone. Check for reception up here. Sylvia, watch out! Sylvia! Oh. We're moving. - Ah, you're awake. - Oh. I was afraid you were gonna sleep through our whole father-daughter trip. Dad, what is this all about? This is about me reclaiming my place in rightful society. - I don't understand. - Oh, sweetheart. You don't have to understand, all you have to do is just enjoy the fireworks at the end of the celebration. Dad, please, dad. Dad. You know, after your little prank yesterday in the park, I realized that you figured it out somehow. I'm not your dad. So it's true then. Who's my father? He was a loser. He ran out on you mother. And I agreed to raise you if she could just leave him behind. She just couldn't forget him. She was gonna tell you everything. I couldn't let that happen. I'd already lost everything, I lost my career, I lost my dignity, my self-respect. I raised his little brat, and he was coming back to take your mother? What are you talking about? Your dad decided he finally wanted to meet you, after all those years. But I knew what he was really after. I knew. So I tricked him, I got him to go out on the boat, I told him, I told him we needed to talk things out. And then... I pushed him over right before I sank the boat. You know, they never found his body. Your mother, she, uh, she must have tried to swim to shore. - I knew it was you! - I loved her! This is why you kicked me out, I'd always thought it was because of the insurance money. Insurance money? Are you... Your mother took out loans for your dreams. What about my dreams? I could've made my Mark in this world. I could've, I could've been somebody. And instead, I was reduced to cheating, stealing, just to scrape by. That's where I met your friend Becca. What does this have to do with Becca? Yeah, see, I met, uh... I met Becca in Vegas... And I figured, well, sooner or later she's gonna remember me. So, uh... - I just made it sooner. - Stop, stop. You took everything from me. You wouldn't be anything without me. And today's the day that you're gonna pay. What the hell are you doing? - You won't get away with this. - Put that down! The entire Fil knows what you've done! Sylvie, Sylvie, Sylvie, come on. Put that thing down. You don't have the guts to kill me. It's not in you. You're not a killer. You make jewelry. Earl! Sylvia, be careful. Captain spinks is not answering my calls. I spoke to him last night. He assured me everything was in order. Should I call and let everyone know the trip is canceled? Yes, it's pretty clear we're not going anywhere today. - Hey. - Today's the day that you're... Are you... Sylvia and Vanessa are in danger? - You know, Sylvia... - Earl, it's time to stop! You just made me realize you're not gonna ride off into the sunset without me. Tell you what, let's just watch the fireworks together. - What do you say? - Stop. What a lovely way to die! Earl! Dad... I just can't stop looking at it. Corey did a beautiful job. I really think he's gonna go far as a jewelry designer. I can't wait to show Luke. Was Corey surprised about the promotion? Yes, and I'm surprised by how much I'm enjoying the extra time with you and the Fil. And Noah. - I'm seeing him again tonight. - Huh? Do you have anything you wanna say to me? You were right, Claire. He's perfect for me. - And you knew it all along. - Oh. Come here. Mm... Mm... - Can you believe it? - Ah, it's a dream come true. All the members are loving lush designs' fabulous new app. Thankfully, with Jesse behind bars, it was a simple task to get all of the members complete access to the most talented jewelry designer I know. I bet all the members will be wearing your designs at the next meeting. Well, I can't think of a better place to debut the app than here where our partnership started. It was a wonderful gesture to donate tonight's proceeds to the Becca brown design studio for teens. Becca would've loved that. To Becca. Yes. Hey, I hear someone has a blind date later. Well, it worked out so well for Sylvia, so... To lasting friendships and powerful women who help each other. - Cheers to that. - All right, bring it in. Bring it in, bring it in.
