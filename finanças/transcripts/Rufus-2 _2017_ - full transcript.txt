** (birds chirping) (dog barking) ** (man) Here, doggy, doggy. (clinking) (dog barking in the distance) (meowing) Here, kitty, kitty. (computerized voice on radio) There are fourdogs and two cats nearby. (brakes squealing) (beeping) (electrical whirring) (dogs barking) (beeping) (electronic chirping) (computerized voice on radio) There is one dog nearby. Is this on? Oh, hi. Um, if you don't know me, I'm Manny Garcia, and this top-secret blog was-- Was my idea. This is Paige, my girlfriend, and the blog was her idea. The journalist in me insists this phenomena be documented. Although our experience is still only known by a select few, one day we may need to tell our story, and if print media is going to ignore us... then we'll go digital. Right. Anyway, the reason we're doing this blog is because it's been an entire year since... Manny, Manny, Manny, Manny-- Hey, Paige. Hey, did you know that hot dogs aren't made of actual dogs? They're totally fine to eat! Can you believe that?! Can you... ... since that started happening. Rufus, buddy, relax. ** I got a little excited. See, this is our new normal. Rufus's magical amulet broke when we were tangling with some thugs. We thought it would never work again. But that was only partially true. It works. As long as he doesn't get too excited. See? (gasping) Oh no. ** Free ball! * Ho ** (Paige) Or nervous. (gasping) (barking) (Manny) Or angry. (gasping) Squirrel. Stupid squirrel! What is it with you and squirrels? I have many moods. That you do. Even though the amulet works most of the time, it got way too hard to keep the truth from my parents. So, Mom, Dad, my friend Rufus and my dog Rufus are actually the same person. (chuckling) ** It's a win-win. I get to eat people food and dog food. Oh, sometimes... your shoes. (Manny) Rufus makes life really fun. ** (Paige) Or at least interesting. But I'm not sure our neighbor, Mrs. Rumstitch, would agree. (gasping) This last year, Rufus has been really good at making friends. Rufus, take it to the doghouse. (boys cheering) But he's still not so good with the girls. Hey, Rufus, did you happen to see the cookies I brought in for the bake sale? They were right here. Gross. Wow. I can't believe you shared that incredibly deep and personal story with me, Darla, and... Frisbee! (snarling) But whatever. I'm just glad to have my best friend back. Me too. But not as glad as I am about this hot dog. I really wanna eat it. Okay, I'm gonna do it. All right, ready? Oh my gosh! (chuckling) (school bell ringing) ** Later, guys. I'm off to my Questioning Journalism 101 class. My question is... (recorder beeping) ... what's the 101 for? Wow, Paige, you're like German Shepherd smart. (chuckling) You'll always be a puppy at heart. Oh. Oh yeah. Okay. Enough scratching. See you at lunch. Man, Paige is great. Yup, strongly agree. (sighing) I wish I could find someone like her. Come on, just have faith, okay? Somebody will want you just the way you are. (maniacal guttural voice) You have no idea how right you are. Rufus is very wanted. At least that magical amulet of his is. Soon it will be mine. (laughing maniacally) (speaking in high-pitched voice) This voice machine makes everything sound so evil. (beeping) (squirrel) Scott. (typewriter dinging) Scott, get in here. You cackled and then bellowed for me, sir. Yes, Scott. Now that we know where the dog's been hiding, it's time to get our hands on that amulet so the big plan can unfold. Don't forget, I have the best in the business working for me. Rufus will be no match for our newest operative. (laughing maniacally) ** Hey. I haven't seen you around before. You need a tour guide or-- (hissing) Oh... okay. I'm just gonna go do that thing I was gonna do. ** Hey... can I have your pudding cup? No. Please? No. Please? No. Please? No. Please? No. Please? No. Please? No. Please? No. Please? (sighing) How can you say no to a face like that? Rufus, my name is Kat. I'm new to school and that's why I've come to you. You were the new kid in school last year. Ah, a little investigative research. I like the way this one thinks. Hey, Kat, you know, I was the new kid last year. We'd be happy to show you around. Tell me about yourself, Rufus. Uh... Well, Kat, I'm a dog. I mean, I'm hum-- I'm-- I'm not-- Person. He's a dog person. Yup. I'm human. Loves him those dogs that Rufus does. I'm a human. (sighing) Not a fan of dogs. Not a fan of dogs. What's to like? They're simpletons. Needy, dirty. They've been known to eat their own barf. Well, maybe they're just being practical. Don't wanna waste food. So, Kat, let me guess. You're more of a cat person because of your name, so it's like... That's a good one. (chuckling) We should go out. How about tonight? Actually, I'm sorry, but we have plans-- Yes. I-- I would love to go on a date with you, Kat. Hmm... Purrfect. Meet me at 5:00 by the big cat city sign. Okay. Did you see that? I got a girl to like me. I gotta get her flowers 'cause that's what you do on a date, right, you get flowers, right? Bye! Did that just happen? (sighing) (barking) (gasping) (shrieking) (cell phone beeping) It's Kat. I've made contact with the target. How was he? As dumb as you'd expect a dog to be. His human friends were even more annoying. But I've made arrangements to get him alone. I promise you, the dog's amulet will soon be mine, and then it will be yours. (cell phone beeping) I will never get used to these stupid human bodies. ** (meowing) ** I don't know, guys, what if I mess this up? What if-- what if she realizes that her date is really a dog? Ha-- she wouldn't be the first girl to make that discovery. Figure of speech. At least I got her flowers. How do these look? Think she'll like these? Well, that is a tomato plant. And the, uh, tomatoes... are rotten, so... (sighing) Not a good start. Guys, I'm gonna mess this up. (Manny) Easy, Rufus, okay? We're gonna show you what to do. And what not to do. ** Do dress nice. How bad do you think this is gonna go? I have to wear a leash? Necktie. I don't go out without one. And the girls like it. Weird. Do pull out her chair. Do make sure she gets served first. Oh, sweet. Do not eat her food. What if her dinner is better than mine? It's not. It's not. Do smell good. Do not smell her. Anywhere. Man, there's no way I can remember all these complicated human rules. She's gonna guess I'm a dog for sure. She hates dogs. I just wish there was some way you guys could come with me. Actually... there is. They're coming with us? Uh, yeah, it's called a double date. (chuckling) I know, I couldn't believe it either-- it's great. You don't mind if we join, do you? Yes! I mean, yes, you can come with us. Fine. (sniffing) I like you, you smell nice. (clearing throat) (clearing throat) Uh, I mean, I'm assuming you smell nice because I'm not sniffing you. That'd be weird. Okay, who wants dinner? Me. (Paige) Let's go. What... is... this?! ** I've never seen so much beautiful, enchanting yarn. Uh, Kat, do you knit? What's knitting? Ooh! (giggling) That looks kind of fun. Here I come. (laughing) (Rufus) Kat's right. Yarn is awesome! Yeah, yarn really gets everywhere, huh? Yeah, apparently. Yeah. ** Oh... (sniffing) Oh! (sniffing) (laughing) Norman was here. Norman was here! Guys, Norman was here. Norman's great. No, no, no. You're gonna love him. No-- this guy. He's always clowning around, right? Rufus, calm down. What? Oh, that was a dog thing to do, huh? Yes. Do-- do you think Kat noticed? Do you think she knows I'm a dog? I think you're okay. No way. (chuckling) Norman! What's up? I smelled you on 5th and Main on the fire hydrant. Dude, you hit everything. (barking) Uh... have we met? No. But Norman's told me all about you. How hard is it to refresh a water bowl on a regular basis? (barking) No. I'm sorry. What are you thinking? I hope you like this restaurant, Kat. It's one of my favs. Ta-da. Captain Foamy's Seafood Treasure Chest. It's cheesy but fun. Seafood. Oh, yes! I think she likes it. (computerized voice on radio) There is one dog and one cat nearby. (metallic clanking) Once the power of that amulet is finally mine I shall be the most powerful human on earth! (laughing maniacally) Scott. Yes, sir. Our hunter is nearly in possession of Rufus's amulet. The plan is now going to the next phase. It's time to begin production. (laughing maniacally) Oh! So many fish. Bad Rufus. Yar, mateys. How be ye enjoying your grub? My fish isn't as fresh as those. Har-har. Now there be a joke I haven't heard before. (chuckling) Eight years of Juilliard for this? So, Kat, are you new to the area or just our school? I'm from... around. Around here or somewhere else? Yes. Ah... Oh. (glass shattering) (cats meowing on cell phone) I have to take this. I can't talk right now. I'm right in the middle of something. Rufus! You have your own fries. Eat those. Hers taste better. No, they don't. No, they don't. (cell phone beeping) There's a complication. The humans came with the dog. No, they suspect nothing. Well, you know how humans are. Even dumber than dogs, if you can believe that. Still, I may not be able to get the amulet tonight. (electrical chirping) Something's up. Gotta go. (electrical chirping continues) That's no dog catcher. (squeaking) Hmm... Maybe a little dessert. Uh... Ahh... Stop being dramatic. Oh, it's this people leash. It makes swallowing large chunks of food really difficult. Uh, I gotta get it off. Not a good thing. So... Kat's not exactly chatty, is she? Wait, do you think this date's going bad? Do you think she noticed I ate her food? Wait, should I have sniffed her tail? Should I have sniffed her tail? Oh no, this date is going bad. Do you think she-- do you think she noticed I'm a dog?! ** (gasping) (barking) Yar, there be no dogs allowed inside Captain Foamy's! Oh my... (shrieking) (gasping) (barking) Sorry, Mr. Pirate Waiter. Oh... oh... I'm just gonna get the check. ** (panting) Hey! Don't you scallywags be returning back to Captain Foamy's any time soon! Dead men tell no tales! (sighing) I hate pirates. (panting) I ruined the date, didn't I? Don't worry about it, okay? She didn't see it so it never happened. (gasping) Ugh... Uh... we-- we had to leave the restaurant 'cause-- To come find you. We thought maybe you needed some help. With my phone call? Yes. Yes. Maybe you didn't have like a good signal, which you did because the phone rang, so obviously signal was no issue. Solid service in this area. Oh, hey, look, it's Paige. The pirate didn't seem to want us to come back, Kat, so I had them, uh, wrap up your meal. Shiny and crinkly? Yes. And here's your doggy bag, Rufus. (bubbling) (giggling) (Rufus) Wait, wait, wait. So they don't let doggies in the restaurant but they have bags for them? Come on, Captain Foamy, pick a lane! Ooh! Kat! Are you all right? I think so, yes. It was the mail truck! See? This is exactly why the K9 population are not fans. Rufus, you saved me. ** Well, I like you, Kat. I wouldn't wanna see you get hurt. Hey, look... the food's still good. (purring) (Kat) I like the tie back on. I won't ever go out without it. Maybe this turned out okay after all. Maybe. (dog barking) The pet store! Oh, this place is great. Ooh, look, Power Puppy Kibble. I love that stuff. (clearing throat) (clearing throat) Uh... I mean... my dog loves that stuff. Not me. Why would I eat that? I'm not a dog, nor have I ever been... (clearing throat) ... a dog. But they do have some really yummy things here. Yes, they do. ** Are you seeing what-- Yes. That amulet looks just like Rufus's. (crickets chirping) ** (buzzer blaring) (conveyor belt whirring) (hissing) (crunching) (slurping) Hey, hey, Mr. S. Look what I have here. Your first batch of acorn butter. (laughing) Oh! How does it taste? Well, let's find out, shall we? Hmm... (stomach growling) Well, it's, um, diff... (burping) ... different. Well, Scott, once we have the amulet's magic, we will transform the acorn butter into an irresistible treat. People will have no choice but to turn to me for more. And with me as a human, no one will suspect my plan-- (whirring) Look, Scott. My acorn factories are already built through out the world! Yes, it'll be good to be a human. Now all I need is Rufus and his amulet and it will be squirrel domination! Go ahead, Scott, celebrate with another taste. About that becoming human thing. What's up with the dog boy? How goes your scheming to have that magic amulet of his? Oh, it goes very well, Scott. Our hunter is right on top of that amulet. Soon its magic will be mine. (laughing maniacally) (school bell ringing) ** Ooh! I like that. And I like that. And I like... that. Why not just get your own cow? (hissing) Hmm... Hmm... mmm. Oh, isn't she amazing? (Manny) Hey, Rufus, we get that you like Kat and everything but... we're just a little concerned that... I mean, we really don't know much about Kat and some of her behavior is, um, well... Oop! ... peculiar. So we just think after what happened last year with those bad people, we should be careful. Ah, you guys don't have to worry about that 'cause... Kat is nice. And nice people do nice things. Look, she even gave me her leftovers. Her fries do taste better than mine. No, they don't. No, they don't. Oh, which reminds me, we have another date tonight after school. This time she told me not to bring you guys, which means it must have gone pretty good. Actually, Rufus, we think that you should-- Get more flowers. I was thinking the exact same thing. I'll get the good ones this time. Hey. Hey, Mrs. Rumstitch. I have a date, I need some flowers. Oh! Thanks. (groaning) You're the best, Mrs. Rumstitch! We should've come right out and told Rufus we saw Kat wearing that amulet. He doesn't do well with subtle. I doubt that would've convinced him anyway. I mean, he likes every person he meets. Yeah, but for all we know, she's not even a person. What do you mean? I mean, with that amulet, she could be a dog or a-- I know things haven't gone the way you wanted. Some kind of animal catcher has been following us every step. But I'm meeting with the dog soon and this time his friends won't get in the way. The amulet will soon be yours. (cell phone beeping) (Kat gasping) (electrical chirping) ** (meowing) (gasping) Kat! Kat is a cat! I'm kicking myself. I mean, it was so obvious that she's after his amulet, and now we know she's trouble. This is last year all over again. We've got to somehow show this to Rufus. I have a plan. Come on. I've got a date. I've got flowers for my date. Hey, what's up? I got a date and I got flowers for my date. Do you know that? I got flowers, I got flowers! Hey, why do you give flowers on a date? I don't know. Maybe because they smell nice. Wait, so I can't sniff her but she sniffs these? So confusing. They do smell nice. Really nice. (sneezing) (barking) ** (barking) (meowing) (shrieking) (barking) (girls) Let's go team! (girls cheering) (girls screaming) (all groaning) (barking) (barking) (shrieking) Mortimer, tragedy visits upon us. The Winter Witch has cancelled spring. Spring is cancelled and that's your energy?! Do it again with passion! (barking) (all shouting) (man) Yes, yes! That's the energy I'm looking for! (barking) (clattering) (meowing) We never mix the inert reactant with a catalyst because, as per Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, Emily... You never know what's gonna happen. (barking) (meowing) (all shouting) (explosion blasting) Yay, chemistry! Class dismissed. (coughing) (barking) ** Dogs. ** I'll take that. What have you done? (meowing) Got ya, Kat. (chuckling) Yes! You trapped that stupid cat. Guys, I was chasing it everywhere. Rufus, we have some important information, and it's gonna be hard to hear. Kat is a... cat. A kitty, a feline. Specifically this one under the crate. (meowing) (sniffing) (meowing) Wait, that cat is... my Kat? Yes. She was wearing this. Looks just like mine. We heard her say she wants your amulet. Look, Rufus, we don't know what's going on but-- We're pretty sure it isn't good. I think I know. You guys just made this story up. I mean, if Kat really was a cat, why would she name herself Kat? I mean, my name isn't Dog. That's because I named you when we got you from the pound. (gasping) I'm from the pound? A story for another time, but let's stay on topic. What? What about Kat's amulet? Coincidence. And, guys, even if Kat was a real cat, there's no way she'd be this mangy fleabag. (meowing) Now, I have a date with Kat and... I don't know, you guys are just gonna have to deal with that. Yeah, Kat's a cat. Like I wouldn't know that? No. Okay. These are good, right? Yeah. (computerized voice on radio) There is one dog very close by. Target acquired. (weapon whirring) Here, poochy, poochy, poochy. Here, poochy, poochy, poochy, poochy. (meowing) (shrieking) Ow! ** I can't believe you did that! What? Protect our friend? From you? I'm not here to hurt Rufus. I'm one of the good guys. I'm just here to get the amulet. I only hope I can get there first. Rufus, where are you? Could you please explain just what's going on? I'm a cat. We got that. Clever name, by the way. So what part don't you get? The beginning, the ending and pretty much everything else in between. (sighing) Fine. The beginning. Dragon magic is real. What? What? When the dragons left this planet centuries ago, they gifted these amulets to their friends, the cats. Like you do. But one of the amulets was stolen, to be used for evil, passed from hand to hand throughout the ages, unseen. Until it showed up on Rufus's neck. I was sent by the elders. Who I presume are cats too. Obviously. My mission is to retrieve the amulet and keep it out of the tiny evil hands of... the squirrels. Squirrels? Squirrels? Yes. Squirrels are evil. You didn't know that? I think Rufus may have mentioned something once awhile ago but I didn't believe him. Humans. (scoffing) Can a little squirrel really hurt Rufus? Understand this-- the squirrel we are dealing with is evil in ways that make me arch my back and hiss. You've met his thugs before. Last year, when Rufus first found the amulet, if he or any of his minions apprehend Rufus, then Rufus is... (dog howling) ... doomed. (barking) Rufus, Rufus! Rufus, no! (howling) He's gone. ** We find the pistachio eater, we find Rufus. You have no reason to believe me but I wanna help. Right. And then you're gonna take Rufus's amulet. Then he'll be stuck as a dog forever. But at least he'll still be alive. Isn't that more important? Dog or boy, he's... he's still my best friend. Let's do this. (Manny) All right, everyone, keep your eyes open. (Paige) The shells! Go this way. Come on, you mutt! Now get in there and sit! You're not going anywhere. (panting) You're about to make me very wealthy. Ah, my new operative has returned. Welcome, Mr. Biggs. I see you possess what I've pursued over many years. Please let me hold it. Of course, Mr. S. It is an honor. But my price has doubled. Well, that's rude. ** The nuts stop here. Rufus must be inside. It's locked. To a human maybe. ** I'll never get used to that. (meowing) Do you think she always lands on her feet or... Yes, I do. We should split up. I'll go that way. You are a shrewd one, Biggs. But, lucky for you, I'm in a generous mood. Now give it here and your reward will be beyond your wildest dreams. (laughing maniacally) Scott, would you be so kind? (panting) Ahh... At last! At last, I'm finally human! (barking) Weird to be on two feet. Takes some getting used to. (giggling) But my voice? I-- I thought it would be different. Scott, hand me my voice amplifier. Mm-hmm. (speaking in guttural tone) Wonderful, Mr. Biggs. You've come through. And you will be justly rewarded. (speaking in high-pitched tone) Scott, hand Mr. Biggs his reward. (laughing) (screaming) (barking) (laughing maniacally) The squirrel surprise. Never gets old. Hey, get me out of here! My butt's stuck! May I? (giggling) (buzzer blaring) (shouting) Goodbye, Mr. Biggs. (snickering) I mean... (chuckling in guttural tone) But, Mr. S., I came through for you! You can't do this to me! (hissing) Tootles. (groaning) Why?! (screaming) (giggling) (screeching) (flushing) (giggling) (laughing) That was nuts. (chuckling) I never did like him. What should we do with the dog? (speaking in guttural tone) Acorn-mash him! (laughing maniacally) I just love the way you think! And all dogs love to go for rides! We've gotta get to Rufus. Looks like a plan is already in place. At your command. Do it now! (screaming) Nice shot. Ha! Huh? Ah, visitors! But you're too late because I already have the amulet. (giggling) (laughing in guttural tone) (buzzer blaring) Rufus! Can we get to Rufus fast enough? I got Rufus, you get the amulet. ** (whimpering) (hissing) (purring) ** (whimpering) Hang on, Rufus, we're gonna get you out of here. Time to go old school. Oh... All this over a bonehead dog. Well, they can't stop me. I'm human as long as I have this amulet. Whoo! Nut so fast. (screaming) Oh, my tailbone. Ahh, you people... Not yours. Wait, no, no! (screaming) Never was. Ah, nuts! Gotta go. (groaning) "Nut so fast." Really? Yeah, not my best work. ** Ah, got it. Come on! (buzzer blaring) (machine powering down) We got the amulet. Okay. ** What? You saved me. ** What? And who's going to save Kat? (Rufus) No! ** (meowing) Okay, kids, I now have one priceless amulet. I wonder how much I can get for two? Now hand it over or kitty becomes acorn butter. (meowing) Trust me, it's a terrible way to go. It tastes like old gym socks. (shrieking) I'll-- I'll give you the amulet. Rufus, no. Rufus, no. It's okay! It's okay. Kat's life is worth way more than me being a human boy. Oh! Everybody loves a hero! Now hand it over or kitty goes swimming. (shrieking) I'll give it to you. Ooh! I'll give it to you like a human. A human boy with a human leash. I never go out without one. Yah! (yelling) (screaming) (shrieking) (meowing) ** Oh, hi. Nice catch. (Paige) Rufus, that was incredible. (Manny) Cats and dogs hugging? Just when it seems like it can't get any weirder. It just did. Mother? ** Oh... Look. Even more beautiful than I imagined. (chuckling) Thank you. I've been eating a lot of raw eggs. I feel like it's really making my coat shiny. I was talking about the amulet. What? ** (panting) Well done, darling. At long last the amulet belongs to the cats again. Mission accomplished. Let's be on our way. (whimpering) Come, Kat. Time to return to the Clouder. ** (whimpering) Bring the amulet and let's be on our way. No. This isn't right. You sent me here because you wanted me to make sure that the amulet didn't fall into the wrong hands. Well, I've come to know Manny and Paige. And Rufus. And they're kind, loyal, caring. Rufus risked everything for me. (barking) The amulet is already in the best of hands. Or paws, if you prefer. (chuckling) That's a good one. (yawning) A dog with cat magic. Preposterous. It could only mean trouble. They're not trained to protect the amulet. True. But if I stay near Manny and Rufus, I'd make sure they didn't get into any trouble. Overpromising. Into too much trouble. What are you saying? I'm saying... what if I stay in school with Manny and Rufus, watching over the amulet as the protector? As a human? They're not all bad... once you get to know them. You would do all this for that dog? That dog saved my life. Twice. You've still got another seven. He deserves it, Mother. May I add the amulet's already cracked. The crazy thing hardly works anyways. How can you say no to this face? (whimpering) Fine. All I ever wanted was for my little kitten to be happy. If this is what you want... ... Rufus may keep the amulet. You have a difficult job ahead. Be safe, little one. ** (purring) Thank you, Mother. I'll see you tonight. (panting) I'm a boy again! Thank you for rescuing me, Kat. And... when I called you "mangy," I-- I didn't-- I didn't mean that you're mangy. I just meant that you were like, um... that you, uh... that you're, uh-- Had a wild, untamed edge. Right! That thing that Manny just made up. Stop talking, dog. ** (coughing) (hacking) Ooh, you okay? Oops. Sorry. Hairball. Pretend that didn't happen. Okay. Oh, I saw nothing. Let's go. (Manny) So like I said, this is our new normal. Though I don't know that you can call it normal. Power Puppy Kibble! Yes! You're so cute I could just eat you up. No! No! ** Ha, you haven't seen the last of me!
