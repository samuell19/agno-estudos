Hamburg tower to Astana A320. Astana A320, come in. Clear the bus lane immediately. I'm parking next to the Boeing 747-400. - Where? That's the only free space. - Who are you? I hope that works for you. Over and out. Astana, please identify yourself. Early reports of trouble aboard an Airbus A320 en route from Astana to Hamburg came just hours ago. We have now learned that food poisoning incapacitated everyone on board, including the two pilots. Eyewitnesses report the 180 passengers may owe their life to a young girl. I know My life is my own It's all starting From young [7/ be grown I know Whatever comes... Yes, Mom. You've told me often enough. Yeah, Mom, I know. You've told me before. l have a customer. I'm Rocca. Do you know Harvestehude? Like the back of my hand. Super, that's where I need to go. Then I'm your taxi. What did you have for breakfast? - Nothing, it was canceled. I don't take cards, right? Cash only. l have a dream, that's all I need My happy heart beats for you With every breath... Where are you coming from? Baikonur. It's in Kazakhstan. Don't know it, except from TV. That's where they shoot off rockets, right? I didn't know it was a vacation spot. I didn't either. And you flew all by yourself? - No! Just the last part. What? You're not actually allowed to fly an Airbus 320 alone. And nobody's picking you up? Imagine if everyone was picked up. You'd need a newjob. - That's true. You're funny. - Thanks. But your parents are waiting at home, right? No. My mother's in heaven. And my father's off visiting her. How does that work? - Watch out! Are you blind? Man! No, Mom, it wasn't my fault this time. No, it was a squirrel. A squirrel. Stop scolding me. Hold tight, it's wounded. What are you doing? Just letting traffic through. 80 you can talk to your mom. Yes, Mom... Yes? Yes, the squirrel is alive, and the... car is running. I may not be good for anything, but I don't run over animals. Good day. - Hi. You can sleep there. Go straight for 800 meters. In 100 meters, turn left to arrive at your destination. Can I help you? Don't think so. What did you lose? Nothing. But you're looking for something. - You don't say. I'm looking for deposit bottles. Deposit bottles? What for? So I can buy something to eat, what do you think? Did you forget your wallet at home? I don't have a wallet, or a home. | see. Here. That's all l have right now. That's kind of you, but I won't accept your pocket money. Sorry, but I don't have a wallet either. Why are you sorry? Since you don't want the money from my pocket. Casper. Why won't you shake my hand? Nobody's touched mine in a while. Maybe you should wash it. - You're probably right. I'll go do that now. So... Goodbye. - Bye. Yes? Hi. It's me. Who's me? - Grandma? Rocca ? - Yes. Grandma! Here I am. Why so early? I thought you were arriving Monday. Today is Monday. What? It's Monday? - Yes. God, time flies. School starts tomorrow. - Really? I won't be able to take you. I don't get up that early. So, my dears... Let me introduce my granddaughter, Rocca, who was supposed to arrive tomorrow. Of course, I would have picked her up. But here she is. Sweet thing. Good day. - Who are you? Rocca. - Rocca, dear. You've gotten so big. So big that her father thinks she can live alone in his apartment while he sails through space. Sailing around the world? All alone? Dad is with the ISS. Oh God, how awful. - What is it? Her son-in-Iaw is with ISIS. - Nonsense. Dad is with the ISS, the International Space Station. Just so we're clear... I'm not responsible for your upbringing, right? I already raised your mother. - Who turned out great anyway. How would you know? You didn't even know her. But Dad told me a lot of stories. And, after all, he's great too. So great he took off with you back then. And now I'm supposed to look after you. So great he trusts me to live under one roof with you. By the way... - Very funny. I'd play the queen of clubs, Grandma. - Don't call me Grandma. It's hideous. OK, I won't, Gran. In Hamburg, we say goodbye. Right, excuse me. Bye you three. Bye. Look. That's my mom. That's my mom too. That's my dad. I was still inside Mom's stomach. And that's me as a baby. I was almost as small as you are. You'll feel better tomorrow. Look, this will be cozy. Semolina pudding with raspberry sauce. Sounds fantastic. I'll cook, you clean up. Deal? Cool. Lila, dinner's ready! Lila, put the cell phone away and come eat. I'm not on my cell phone. What are you doing? There's a girl with a squirrel at the old witch's house. - Right. You spend too much time on the cell. Come on, Dad's home. And go to bed early. School starts tomorrow. And put your slippers on. - Yes. Lila! Yes. Pay attention. Up there, a really bright, really fast star is coming. That's the ISS. Where my dad is. See? Someday I'll be up there too. Sleep tight. ASTANA ESA SPACE STATION CONTROL Hi, Andrea. Rocca, sweetheart. How are you? - Super. That was you with the plane, right? How did you know? - I listen to the news. Why did you just run off? There was so much hubbub. I wasn't in the mood. Just glad we arrived safely. True. - Can you connect me to Dad on the ISS? Sure, no problem. Hey, Dimitrij. - Rocca. Can I talk to Dad? He's just gone shopping. Funny. Hey, I miss you too! Hi, Dad. - Rocca, you rock star. I just wanted to say I'm here. - Can you hear me? I can even see yOU. But, Dad, next time you go shopping, stop by the barber's. I will. How are things with Grandma? Show me Earth. Sure. Can you see me? I'm waving. So? How're things with Grandma? Good. - Really? Grandma... Dorothea is great. Just how I remembered her. You're joking. Because you like it. - Tell me. Dad, I'm fine. Really. Tell me what you guys are up to. Ijust planted lettuce and carrots. To see if it grows up here. Then Dimitrij and l are going to play Yahtzee. Shouldn't you be in bed at this hour? How would you know, there's no time up there. I always know what time it is where you are. Go to bed, Pumpkin. Tomorrow's an important day. I love you. - Hang on. Is Grandma taking you to school? Of course. - Good. Sleep tight. Where are you? Squirrel? Where are you? Squirrel? There you are. I was worried. I told you you'd feel better today. We need a name for you, so I can introduce you at school. What about... Klitschko. Perfect. By the way, worrying doesn't help anyone. You hear? Nobody. Always remember that, Klitschko. Lila, come on! Let's go! John? John, come here. What's up? We have to go. There's the girl with the squirrel. What? I don't see one. You don't see her? Man, I don't see a squirrel. What's she doing? - Looks like she's a seamstress. Because she's cutting up a dress? Right. Come on. Lila, come on. I'm coming. Damn animal! Grandma... Dodo, do you need help? No, I don't need help. Damn! Last but not least, Max Wiegant. So, that's class 5A. Not quite everyone, unfortunately. But you can head down to your classroom. Good morning. We're a little late... I mean, I am. If I'm interrupting, I can come back later. Yes... er, no. Come in. That's the girl from next door. You must be... - ...a seamstress? Ria Ottilie Clementine... Caesar Alva Kurz. Kurz as in short. Just call me Rocca. And what's your name? I'm Klein as in small... er... I'm Mr. Klein, the principal. Good day. - Good day. I'll help. We're off to a good start. Short and small. - Yes. But we'll figure it out. So, nowjoin your class. Here. Now we'll move on to Class 5B. What kind of sweater is that? Why is she in our class again? Because she chose us, I told you. Yeah, life sucks when you have no friends. I bet she'll be BFF with the new kid. - Yeah. I'm so not into school. There's no point. Watch out, you klutz! Don't know where to sit? Zoe, smile. Who's that? - Look at her. Hello. Are you nuts? - What? Are you serious? You can't just sit next to me. - Why not? What's wrong with you? LOOK AT HER!!! SUPER UGLY AWESOME SWEATER, IN THIS HEAT WELCOME HOME OK, folks. Put the cells away, please. Not for real. Not the ball of wool number. Funny, I thought about it, but somehow I still like it. Desks and chairs to the back and form a circle. We're not babies anymore. You can go back to it in a minute. Hello, I'm Max Wiegand. What else should I say? Tell us something. Preferably about you. I like to play games on my cell phone, watch TV series and l have to play hockey. - But hockey is great. Max, is there anything else we should know about you? I had to repeat third grade. Not just anybody can do that, right? Can I throw it now? Sure, if that's all. Can you catch? - Even you managed to. Hi, I'm Rocca. I moved to Hamburg yesterday. And this is my first time at a real school. I need a diploma to finish my astronaut training. So you've already started the training? - Yes, as a matter of fact. My aunt is a psychologist. Maybe she can help you. Thanks, but I get regular check-ups. Has your aunt ever taken a look at you? And you've never been to school? - No, I was tutored privately. So what did you do there? Everything. It's something different every day. You learn languages, get a medical training, weight training, survival skills, that kind of stuff. Oh, and you dive a lot to get used to zero gravity. And you were allowed to do all that? Not everything, but most of it. I have to go now, sorry. - What do you mean? I didn't know how long it would be. I don't have Klitschko's milk with me. If you want, I can come back later. How long will you be here? See? I told you. It's sweet. We have class until 1 pm. But you can't just leave. - Can I pet him? - Sure. Besides, pets aren't allowed. You're funny. Klitschko isn't a pet. He had an accident. And he needs my help to get better. I see. Can you leave Klitschko with somebody? No, we live alone. - What do you mean? Can we talk about it when I get back? The vet said Klitschko needs regular feedings to recover. OK, but hurry. And you need to find somebody else to keep him tomorrow. That's unfair. - It's an exception. Amely? - Yes. Here, catch! Maybe you should practice catching instead of making fun of other people's sweaters. OK, keep going. Back in a circle. Grandma! Man, watch out, you oaf. - Grandma, what happened? What's wrong with her? - She fell. Felll? l was attacked! It's probably a concussion. - Oh God. We need a relative's phone number. - Whose? Of your parents. OK. - Good luck with that. Thanks. We're taking her to University Hospital. It'll be fine. - No, it won't. Bye. - And close the windows. I will, Grandma. Dear Dorothea, I'm sending photos so you'll know what Rocca looks like now. She's a wonderful, very special girl. She doesn't know I'm writing you. And she wouldn't want me to, because she likes to sort out things herself. Please give her a chance. She is not responsible for Elisa '3 death. She should never have the feeling you think that. That's the only thing I ask of you. She's the most important thing in my life. She's looking forward to school and to you. Please welcome her with open arms. Maybe you'll ﬁnd something in her we both lost. You, your only daughter, and me, the love of my life. Yours, Henning. Sorry, you're hungry, I know. I hope Ms. Behrendt won't be mad we didn't come back. But it wouldn't have been worth it anyway. I'll be right back. Maybe she's not home. We have your homework. - That's nice. Come on in, you can help me. Come on. Why didn't you come back to school? It wouldn't have been worth it. The principal came and saw that you weren't there. That's observant. - Observant? Why? So many kids and he notices one is missing? I wouldn't have thought him capable of that. Aren't you afraid? - Of what? You're going to get in trouble. Would it help to be afraid? No. - See? I'd much rather not be afraid. You need to address him formally. - Who? The principal. - OK, no problem. If that makes him happy. So you live here all by yourself? That's what Ms. Behrendt told Mr. Klein. He said he's going to tell Child Services. Right now, Klitschko lives with me. But Klitschko doesn't cook for you. No, but he cleans up. See? That's our deal. Come on, I want to go boating. We're not allowed to go alone. - But there are three of us. Foun What could happen? We have to do homework. - Maybe I can help you. You have to do it too. So let's get going. Because if we're not home, we can't do homework. Seems right. We'll get in trouble. Why don't you hang outwith Zoe? Can't you think of anything to play? No. Lila would be cut out of every group chat. So, you actually like Zoe a lot. But you don't play with her because the others would be mean to you? She's not that important to me. Why would they be mean to you? Because kids are like that. Are really all the kids that? - Of course. Somehow, I imagined school differently. More fun. Look! - What is it? Come on, we can build a raft. How? These things don't belong to you. It doesn't look like anyone needs them. What now? I know where we can get wood. - Really? Cool. There. We can get our wood from them. We are definitely not going over there. - For once, Lila's right. But we need wood for our raft. And they have some. We can ask. - It's forbidden to talk to them. They could be from anywhere. And they might be dangerous. Where people come from doesn't matter when you're asking them for wood. Hello. Could I have some of your wood? One or two of those palettes? Can Ijust take them? We're going to build a raft. Help yourself. - Thanks. You're the best. That's true. By far. We're right at the top. You're definitely very nice. Nobody's ever said that to us before. Do you know Casper? - Who? He collects deposit empties. I did thatjob once. I got fired. Bankruptcy. You know how many of us there are just in Hamburg? Almost 3000. What? - Rocca, come on. But in Hamburg, they say bye, John. - Bye, guys. Yeah, go for it. John, catch! Right here. And then there. I know lots of big names - Einstein, Schiller, Kant But somehow I don 't know anyone l'll rest for a moment, then I'll go step by step Follow my nose, with my hand in yours Sometimes the path goes up Sometimes down Sometimes it's good Sometimes it's not Sometimes you fall Sometimes you fly so high The View is limitless And you fly high We're going to get in trouble! You're such a turd, John! Our raft! Where have you been? Good day, Ms. Ross. I'm Rocca. Hello, Rocca. We had a clear understanding. Yeah, but you weren't home anyway. It's not about that. I just need to know you're OK. I see. But they're both fantastic. No sniffles, no cough. We laughed a lot. And laughing is good for your health, right? You're on your cell phones all day, you could at least call me back. My cell was in my school bag. - Mine too. And we left them at Rocca's. We were playing outside. - All afternoon? You? - Yeah. Did you do your homework? No. We weren't at home. We'll do it now, it's not much. Can Rocca come too? - And stay for dinner? Please. OK. Sure. Do you want to? Let's go. Astronauts have to be prepared for such an emergency. For when the capsule lands in the sea. We trained for that. In the Black Sea? You're a really fantastic cook. Thank you. You have a healthy appetite. So why were you part of it? Rocca's mother died giving birth to her. Her dad had just found out he could be an astronaut. When he told them he couldn't because of Rocca, they said they really wanted him and he should bring Rocca with him. And your father wasn't afraid for you when you were in that capsule? If you're always afraid, you have much less fun. Rocca speaks four languages. - And she's not on Instagram or Snapchat. Great. That's great. You guys need to go to bed now. - Mom, why? Because there's school tomorrow. Should Roland take you home, Rocca? I live right across from you. I thought maybe you'd be afraid alone. Again. With the fear. - Bye, see you tomorrow. Thank you for the delicious meal. I'd love to come back. - With pleasure. Pretty special girl, eh? Yes. We still do not know who landed the Airbus, saving the lives of the 180 passengers. When did Rocca arrive in Hamburg? We have to do it again today. Only this time we attach a flag. And do our homework first. Rocca? - Yes? Come here. Please come into my office. That was the deal. So show me. What? - Your office. Aha. - I've never seen it. Right, come in. - We'll wait here. I would like to speak to your parents or somebody who is responsible for you. OK, we can try. It takes a little while. Would you please stand back from my computer! Why? Is something wrong with it? The only number on your registration is this one. That's my cell phone. That's no good. We need a parent or legal guardian, a contact person. I'm my own guardian. And I'm a person you can contact anytime. Remember? Short and small. I would like you to bring this back tomorrow, signed by your parents. That's not possible because they're not here. When will they be back? - My mom, unfortunately, never. But my dad will be back... VVhen? - Next year. In August. What? Who's taking care of you? My Grandma. But she's in the hospital. And theyjust said she'll be there for a while. I'm going to visit her today. She can sign it then. But that doesn't solve the problem. Do you have a pen? - Yes. Can I borrow it? Here you go. What are you doing? If it's so important to have this paper signed, now everything's OK. - No. Nothing is OK. I have to inform Child Services. You can't live alone. Look, it's that weenie Zoe. Want your hat back? How can anyone be so mean? It has nothing to do with meanness. I'm responsible... Ria Ottilie? Ms. Meier! Want it back? Hey, stop that! Why are you doing that? Shit! Amely! Man, right on her nose. Action shot. Let us through. Ew, don't do that. It's totally dirty. - No, it's not. Can somebody call an ambulance? It'll be fine. Stay still. Almost done. Hang on a sec. It'll be fine. Perfect. How did you know how to do that? In outer space, you can't call a medic because there aren't any. Still, you can'tjust go and treat a wound like that. Why not? What would you have done? That's a different matter. - Why? Because you're not a medic. I bet he doesn't listen to you, either. Ever seen a layperson bandage a wound that well? Who? - Who? A Iaywoman. Can anyone tell me what happened to little... thingy, what's her name? Amely. - To Amely. I don't know. Honestly, shouldn't that be yourjob? Mr. Klein. - Mr. Klein? Sorry. My duty is above all to ensure that knowledge is passed on. And what's the best way to pass on knowledge? Well? - How dare you speak to me like that? The best way to learn is by having fun. With 700 students I can't keep everyone happy. You're welcome to myjob. Sorry, but I have to get to class. Ask Amely how it happened. To treat and clean the wastewater, substances must be separated from the water. Nora. Lina. Put the phone away. So, during mechanical cleaning, the wastewat... Bullseye. Out. Seriously? - Out! It wasn't me. Give me the phone right now. - It's not a phone. So can I leave now or not? Where do you want to go? I have an interesting story. What do you mean? - Ijust thought of something really cool. You can'tjust start... - Should I or not? Yeah, go ahead. Do you know what happens to the astronauts' sweat and urine on the ISS? What's urine? - Pee. So do you know or not? - No. It's shot out into space, and comes back to us here as rain. No. The astronauts drink it. Don't worry. The ISS has its own treatment plant that can pull evaporated sweat from the air. It's the same principle as normal water technology, just very compact. It saves the supply flights almost three tons of water per year. You can imagine what that means for space travel. What? It's a big step towards living on another planet. So, yeah, may I continue my lesson now? Yes, you may. Ijust got an idea. Where are you going? Y... Yes. Thank you, Ms. Hartholz. I just wanted to make sure that... OK, I'll do it. What? - Yourjob. You said I could. Yes, but... Is there a microphone? A microphone, to call all grade fivers to the schoolyard. Ms. Meier! Who does she think she is? But she can do incredible stuff. Better than class, right? Um, nope. I'm going home. I have a headache anyway. Keep me posted on what happens. You can all step up to the circle. So, is everybody feeling comfortable? Yes. OK, so we 're going to do something cool together. I'll ask questions and anybody who thinks it applies to them steps into the circle. OK? Let's start. First off, everyone... who has a cat. Now, everyone who used to suck their thumb. John? Now everybody who's really, really happy. OK, you can step back. And now anyone who ever made a classmate sad on purpose. Well, this a very special game. It is. And you know that. You can play it again at the next birthday party. Everyone back to class now. Yes, lessons will continue. Too bad Amely wasn't here. The food is barely edible. What are you doing here? - I wanted to visit you. Are you going batty? I've been here the whole time. Sitting right here on this chair. You need to say something when you come in, dearie. They're lovely. Hello. - Hello. Hi, dearie. I'm glad you're here. You need to get an exterminator in. How did this happen? We have vermin in the house. Animals... I hadn't noticed. The animal is the reason I'm here. I slipped. What on earth are you doing there? There are no glasses here. You came specially. Give her a hug. Dodo. Come on. That's it! That's the animal! That's it... How sweet, a squirrel. - This is Klitschko, Grandma. You brought that into the house? Yes, it's injured. - Injured? I'm injured! You're really nothing but bad luck. Dodo! You've gone too far now. This is not the girlfriend I know. You can't hold the child responsible for... I lost my only child. And Rocca lost her mother. Is she going to lose her grandmother too? It's neither your fault nor mine. You hear? Casper. I'm so happy to see you. Nice that you're here. Yeah, Rocca. Hi. I didn't wash them, sorry. No worries. Neither did the other 3000. Were you crying? I'm hungry. - Tell me about it. Are you hungry? Very much. Shall we go eat at my place? Imagine your parents' faces if you brought me home. No. I could order us pizza. Pizza. - Salami? I'm definitely not coming home with you. I guarantee my parents aren't home. Ham? - I love pizza with ham. Come on. Wait. It's still OK. Exactly. Three ham with...? Mushrooms. And artichokes. Pineapple. I love pineapple. Creme fraiche. So, one with mushrooms, artichokes, pineapple and creme fraiche. What do you like best? OK, that too. Thank you. OK. Goodbye. Order's in. When will your parents be back? My dad has a very long commute. And my mom... is elsewhere. Come on. Klitschko. Go back to sleep. Come on. You have a beautiful home. Why don't you have a home? I mean, you're not that... I mean... You mean, stupid? No, I'm not. Out on the streets there are doctors, and businessmen and roofers. Everybody has their own story. Iwas... am... whatever... a lawyer. And why do you collect empties to buy food? It's too long a story. Well, I have time. My wife and daughter, they... died in a car crash. I'm sorry. I haven't ever talked about it, and I don't want to now. - OK. Now | live the life I can put up with best. - OK. That doesn't look like a pizza delivery. Good day, my name is Hartholz. I'm from Child Services. How nice. Come right in. - Excuse me? You don't have to stand in line here. Come in. Dad? Dad, we have a visitor. From Child Services. Dad? How nice. To what do we owe the honor? I think she bought the principal's story that I actually live here all alone. That's funny. Offer the lady something to drink. I'll be right with you. - OK. Don't you have anything to eat in the fridge? No, but in the suitcase. The suitcase. Good. So, your name is Ria Ottilie Clementine Caesar Alva... Kurz. Rocca for short. Kurz, right. Thank you. Good day. Good day. Good day. - No. Better not. Bad cold. Forgive my appearance. It's really laid me out. I'm sorry. - No worries. How can I help you? The school reported... that, er... Ria Ottilie... - Just call me Rocca. Dad does. - True. Good. That your daughter... this young girl here, lives alone in the house, because her father is... you are... a practicing astronaut in space. Interesting. Interesting, yes. Now, I'm not sure either. I'd say we can make short work of this. If you would just show me some proof of identity. Identity? - Identity. Identity. - Identity. You want to identify me? - Your passport, Dad. Right. My passport. - Exactly. You should have said right off the bat. Where did I leave it? I must have... Shit, the Russians have it. Or no, I left it in the capsule. Even the universe can't stop bureaucracy. - No. That'll be the pizza. You're welcome to join us. Right, Dad? Of course. You can have my pizza. I'm not a bit hungry. He always eats like that when he has the flu. Let's hope it helps. Rocca, my records show that your mother died giving birth to you. The grandmother, your alleged guardian, is in the hospital. And you are on the ISS. Well, here today, gone tomorrow. Hardly there, had to leave... You know, I don't like to have my leg pulled. Just wanted to lighten things up a little. There are children present. Right... I'll set tomorrow as a deadline to produce the missing documentation. If you are really her legal guardian, we won't trouble you any further. If not, we will report the case to family court. They will appoint a guardian for Rocca, or send you to a foster family. OK? You really have a way with kids. I'm doing my duty. You'll have to explain to me why that is a bad thing. Busy here today. I'll be on my way. We've said all we need to, right? Bye. Bye. It's so boring at home. So what are you up to? Plus we brought food. That's sweet. Dad will be pleased. Dad? Is he... This is Ms. Hardsteel from Child Services. - Hartholz. Holz as in wood. Steel would be a better fit. Good. I'll say 'bye.‘ Goodbye. - Bye. Come in, guys. Thank you, Casper, you were... Casper? "Dear Rocca, today you made me feel I was worth something. That was wonderful. I thank you for that. And, of course, for the pizza too. Casper." Who's he? - A friend. Everything OK? Yeah. Come on, you can help me. So, the first one's finished. - Let's see. Looks great, eh? LAUGH! Think we'll find a nanny this way? - Sure. It might seem strange for a child to look for its own nanny. How else could you do it? Wait a sec. Grandma is supposed to do all those things. Rocca ? - Yes? Is everything OK? - Yes, why? I've been trying to reach her for days. Hey, what's going on? Dodo is in the hospital. She fell, because of Klitschko. I didn't want you to worry. - Who’s Klitschko? So, you're all alone in the house? Soon, yeah. The lady from Child Services will put me in foster care unless I find a nanny. A guardian. Slow down. Which hospital is Dodo in? The UKE. - Good. Dad? - Yes? No, she doesn't. Yes, she does. She said I'm nothing but bad luck. You're the greatest girl in the whole world. You have all your mother's enchantment in you. And Dodo will see that at some point. You know, before it happened, she was warm and fr... Dad? I'll call back. Can you hear me? We 've had a little incident. What does that mean? Nothing. It's... normal. Probably an... ammonia leak. Or space junk. But isn't that dangerous? Nothing's ever happened to my dad. Never, ever. Do you want to come to our place? You know Mom doesn't want that. She thinks you're a bad influence on us. She didn't put it that badly. She's afraid you might put us in danger, because you're so... Don't worry about me. You don't need to worry about me, OK? Being afraid doesn't help anybody. See you tomorrow. And I'm sure your father will be fine. Yeah. You can fly planes and rockets, too We cannot complete your call as dialed. You can save people and animals, too You catch butterflies and put them in your tummy The others might say you're off your rocker But what others say doesn’t matter to you Are you thinking of me right now? I'm thinking of you right now Don 't worry It's never helped anyone And don 't forget, I'm here for you No matter what you do No matter what you do Don 't worry It's never helped anyone And don 't forget, I'm here for you No matter what you do Bye. Take care, Klitschko. Stop staring at me. Stop whining. Crybaby. We can stay friends. Being free is a good thing, trust me. This is the right thing. And never cross the street again without looking both left and right, OK? Bye, Klitschko. What are you doing? - I let Klitschko go. Why? You love him. That's exactly why. He's healthy again. Are you OK? Come on, you can ride on the back. That was great, what you did yesterday. Thanks. Are you afraid of the homeless too? - No, why do you ask? I don't understand why nobody helps them. My dad says they don't want help. Just like Zoe? What's Zoe got to do with it? You know exactly what I mean. Okay, got it. Have you seen this? l was waiting outside school and that wimpy bimbo Zoe came and really insulted me and pushed me. I got such a horrible cut. It bled so hard. They had to call an ambulance. I'm in really bad shape, I have such a headache. You should deﬁnitely feel sorry for me. Although, feel sorry for Zoe. She needs it more. See ya! I can't believe mean stuff like that is allowed. You're not even supposed to have an account until you're 13. How many people are watching that? Amely has at least... 500 followers. And all post horrible stuff? - No. Lots of different stuff. Show it to me. - We have to get to school. We will. But show it to me. Please. Do you watch stuff like that every day? I mean, most of it is totally idiotic. "Hello, my sweeties, welcome to my new video. I love all of you to bits." OK, so influencers or YouTube stars have all those followers because... Why, exactly? Well, because they're cool. And role models. - Role models, yeah, right! Or they can do something special. You probably don't get that. Because you only ever hung out with adults. They got famous for something, and built a community. So, if I posted a video about something I cared about, nobody would watch it. - Probably not. But if I posted a video first showing how I landed that plane... and people saw it, then I'd have a community. And then it might work, right? Almost for sure. But it wasn't you, was it? You're already 13, right? - Yeah, why? So you know how to set up, like, a Facebook or YouTube... thingy. 'Course. - Cool. Morning. - Hello, guys. Hey! - You again. This is my friend, Max. - Hello. We went shopping. We brought you some yummy stuff. Cool. Look, boys. Come on. I'll have some juice. Like Christmas. Folks. Folks, I have something to say. Guys! Hey, guys! I have something to say. I want to try something and maybe a few of you could help. For sure, kiddo. - Of course. What do we need to do? Dad, finally. - So sorry, Pumpkin. I hope you weren't worried. We had a space junk alarm. We just managed to avoid it. I never worry about you. Nothing ever happens to you. To be honest, I've never been so scared in my whole life. Oh, Pumpkin. But I can't talk right now. I've got something to do. What's up with Child Services? - Could you send me an email? I need a letter of custodianship. With a signature. So they know you consent. Consent to what? - Love you! Hang on. The day is saved. Guys... - What do you need us to do? Max and I need your help. You live here? Pretty cool. Cool. Can I try? Aren't your parents here? Nope. They never are. You wouldn't want them here anyway. Why? Would they think I'm dumb? - No. Not you, themselves. I get it. Really? I don't. Come on, let me show you something. OK, play it again. Cool people, eh? We 're doing something truly cool. Oh, God, we'll cut that. No, leave it in, it's funny. People talk down to you. At the employment ofﬁce. You can’t even imagine how nice it is when someone talks to you. We just need to shorten it... Now. What's it like... - That's good too. ...when people just walk by without noticing you? You get used to people looking at you as if you were contagious. Yeah, that's good now. - Yes. Some parents even warn their kids not to talk to you. ROCCA CHANGES THE WORLD UPLOAD SUCCESSFUL There you are. - Yeah. Why? Ms. Behrendt is in the principal's office. There's a hearing tomorrow to decide if you go to foster care. And after school, the lady from Child Services is taking you. What's going on here? Did I miss something? Yeah, you did. This is no good. I'll have a guardian tomorrow. I have eight applications. And you must come to school. Hello? - Which one of you is Rocca? Listen, you can'tjust barge in here. Me. I'm Rocca. Madame is back. - Oui, Monsieur Petit. Great. We'd like to chat with you. - One second. Do you have Ms. Hartholz' number... Mr. Klein? Thank you. - Listen... Could you... - I'm on the phone. Ms. Hartholz? Yes, exactly. I heard you wanted to take me home with you today, but I'm afraid I have to postpone. I'll be at your event tomorrow, though. I'll bring Rocca. - Thank you. Can I please... Ms. Holz? - Bye. Er, Hart? Let's upload the next video. Will do. - Super. Oh, I'm auditioning nannies at my place this afternoon, in case anyone wants to come. - What? I'm sure we'll find somebody who wants to be my guardian. Could you please explain? Rocca landed the plane. The one where nobody knew who it was. - Seriously? And she made a video of it to show her father. We posted it online to get her some attention. Nobody knows how to land this thing. And the pilot is in bad shape right now. There ’s a lot going on, but I know I can do it. She wants to become an influencer, but not for beauty. For important things. Somehow, it's like kids who get bullied. That's probably how it started for most of us. It was for me. When you feel worthless, even as a child. Some parents even warn their kids not to talk to you. Why are you even doing this? Because I want more people to not look away... She's great. - ...but help instead. If people make it so hard for you, something needs to be done. That's incredible. Zoe? Do you have your cell? Get it out. TOM MULLER ADDED ZOE KRAMER TO "COOLEST CLASS 5A" WELCOME TO THE CLASS CHAT When are the first nannies due? - In 20 minutes. Rocca? Look. Klitschko. I'll ask, OK? Hello? What are you doing here? - We wanted to ask if we could join in. Keep moving, you victim. Of course, you can. Come in. Thanks. If you don't know me, you're missing something Come, let me show you the world the way I like it If you hide yourself, you'll never be found Come along into my world If you don't know it You're missing something And if you know yourself You're in the circle Hold your horses, I'm almost there. I just want to know why you’re so alone What's going on? When is Rocca's birthday? November 27, why? Right. Maybe it's about the new school. Hang on, I'll take a picture. Should I go in? - No, forget it. Custody... Child Custody Mandate? "I, born on..., hereby declare myself the custodial representative of my daughter, Ria Ottilie Clementine Caesar Alva Kurz." Sorry, children. I can't do this. No. Your ad said you were looking for a nanny. This is something completely different. I can't be your guardian. I had fun. - Me too. Good luck. - Thanks. Take care. What now? No idea. But the court hearing is in three hours. Do you have a lawyer? My dad says it's important. I completely forgot! I have a friend who's a lawyer. Come on, we have to find him. Casper! - That's where I first met him. Did you find him? - No. Damn! Why don't we just call him? Oh, man, Amely! - What? He doesn't have a cell. - Landline? LandHne. Sometimes grown-ups use those. How could he have a landline when he doesn't have an apartment? You need to go. Ms. Behrendt is coming to pick you up. I know. - Take care. Should we keep looking? I've been looking for you. You for me? I've been looking for you. You need to help me. I saw your video in the metro. - In the metro? Incredible. You're really... you're crazy. But great. Great and crazy. No wonder I couldn't find you if you were riding the metro. Today was my day off. - You wacky guy. A few companies made contact. They want to donate sleeping bags and other stuff. Really cool, eh? It won't work, Rocca. Look at me. So what? You're you. Casper. No. I'm a stinky, unwashed homeless guy. If you want something, you can get it, my dad always says. Why won't it work? I need a lawyer and you are one. Let me tell you something so you'll understand why it won't work. My wife... her name was Ellie. She called me back then at the office. I was working on another "big case." And even though I'd promised to do it, I forgot to pick up our daughter from hockey practice. Ellie... Ellie wasn't mad. She... she said she'd do it, I could take my time, and she was looking fonNard to spending the evening together. Half an hour later, the call came. "Your daughter and your wife have been in an acci..." So you think it was your fault? Why did I care more about myjob than my family? Why? Why wasn't I standing at the side of the field during practice, proudly cheering my daughter on? Why didn't I... drive her home safely aften/vards? I can't be born again just so my mother doesn't die. Why didn't anybody say, "go to a different hospital." Maybe they would have saved her there. That's all hooey. But my mom certainly wouldn't have wanted me to be sad all the time. And your family wouldn't have wanted that either. We keep on living for them. Or maybe I should live on the streets with you and collect bottles? I will, you know. Rocca, are you coming? Please help me, Casper. I can't. Your cell phone. So of course it is utterly irresponsible to allow a girl of eleven to live alone in a house without parental care. Does your father know you're here today? - Of course he does. What do you think? I mean, Your Honor. Might I be allowed to speak? - Yes. Thank you. I've never met a girl like Rocca in my entire life. I'm sure she can take better care of herself than most adults could. I'd like to believe you, but... You know what? A lot of the kids at my school live with their parents, but they're still alone. My child, there are laws we must obey. Ms. Behrendt, Rocca did not arrive at school until noon yesterday, which is an infraction of compulsory schooling laws. Do you allow that at your school? - No, of course not. Well, thank God. Let's conclude this discussion. I'm sure you'll do well in a foster family. Exactly. Did you know this was Rocca? "11-year-old girl saves 180 lives"? And I'm number 181. - Casper! Good day, my name is Hilbner. I represent Henning Kurz. - You? Yes. Here. Big hugs from your dad. - Thank you. And look at my pretty hands. Oh, hello. This is a nice surprise. - Hello. How do you know him? We had pizza together. You? - His daughter was in my class. I have to ask proforma if all those present agree that Doctor Casper Hilbner... Dr. Hiibner? - Hello, Mr. Goldmann. Ms. Hartholz, nice to see you again. I really mean that. I wanted to apologize for the other day. I wasn't actually sick. I was very hungry. Of course. May I begin? The court's mandate is to interfere as little as possible in parental care, right? - Yes. Intervention is called for only when the child's wellbeing is in danger from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or violence. Right? Right. Ms. Hartholz, did you have the impression that any of those things is true of Rocca? Not directly that impression. However... Please just answer the question. No. - No. That means the only problem is that Rocca needs a guardian who is capable of evaluating whether Rocca can live alone until her grandmother returns. That would be sufficient, correct? Well... - And you could appoint one, right? I could, but... Rocca? - Yes? Will you eat regularly? Do you promise to go to school? And to go to bed on time? - I'll even brush my teeth. And Ms. Hartholz, the next time you visit, I'll have something in the fridge to offer you. Promise. The rest of the time, eight hours per day, Rocca is at a clearly very attentive and caring institution called school. Your Honor, are you sure a foster family is really necessary in this special case? Who would you like to be the guardian? I'll do it. With pleasure. Thank you, Casper. No further questions, Mr. Goldmann. Court is closed. Are you hungry too? - Pizza? Whatever you want. My treat. Good bye. - Goodbye. What about you? Are you... hungry too? Yes. Great. Then I suggest we meet in half an hour at Paolino's? Can you take Rocca? I need to do something. Sure. See you there. - See you there. His daughter was a really sweet girl. Outgoing, cheerful. I can imagine. But you can't imagine how handsome he was. I hate to interrupt you lovely ladies, but may I join you? Yes, I can imagine. There, that's it. The third one back, the white one. That's yours? - Yes, that's my house. I was just there again for the first time, it's really dusty. It's still unbearable to be there. I want to sell it and rent a small apartment. With the rest of the money I want to start a charity for the homeless. How did you two meet, anyway? Rocca wanted to help me collect empties. Hey, everybody. I just had a great idea. Everyone from the Hegel school needs to bring their empties from home on Friday. To school. Nuts, what am I saying? Anyone who sees this should do it. There will be... Cake. - Cake for everyone. This is my teacher. She's given permission for this. And this is my friend Casper. I told you about him. Look at how nice he looks. All the money we collect with the empties will go to the charity. Exactly. Dad, I love you to the stars and back. And Grandma, if you ever see this, please tell me about Mom. When she was little. You're the only person I know who can do that. I love you. Where do the bottles go? - Up by the gate. Is there perhaps some other pain that's preventing you from getting better? Excuse me. Turn the TV on. Quickly. - Why? What? - Why? Do it. Excuse me. Nobody knows how to land this thing. And the pilot is in bad shape right now. There ’s a lot going on, but I know I can do it. This daughter of an astronaut not only saved the lives of 180 people, using her YouTube channel she advocates for the homeless and combats school bullying. Amazing what you can do with this thing. What motivated you to do this? My dad is an astronaut. Up in space, it doesn't matter where you come from or what you look like. Up there is the only place where there ’3 peace and we're all equal. This young girl also posts emotional messages. And Grandma, if you ever see this, please tell me about Mom. When she was little. [love you. You wanted to speak to one of my relatives. - Yes. We 're all excited to see what Rocca will do in the future. Then take me to my granddaughter right away. She needs me. And I need her. Children, please clear some space. Rocca? - Yes? Want to try? Only if I may call you by your first name from now on. Well, OK. I'm Wilfried. Wilfried Alexander Klein. OK, Willy. Let's do it. - Oh, please. Ms. von Kram? - Yes? Your bag. - I'm in a hurry. Now, everyone who wishes their parents would talk to them more and be honest. You stay here. You're embarrassing me in front of all these people. Now, everyone who wants to thank somebody. Thank you. - Thank you. May I? - Of course. Now all those who've sometimes made mistakes in bringing up their kids. Also those who have a lot of fears, but would like to change that. May I? - Of course. Everyone who's in love right now. And now everybody who wants to ask for forgiveness. - Dodo! Dodo! - No. Gran. I'll tell you anything you want to know about your mom. But one thing I can tell you right now. She would be so incredibly proud of you. I've learned to enjoy life To tend my friends like flowers I've learned to stoke the ﬁre Not to lose the magic I've learned ﬁrst impressions can be deceptive And that it's good when you go astray I've learned that even when it's dim the sun will rise And that's when an idea is sparked Like a cool wind, a new day A new idea is sparked And it brings light to the darkness And everything is now It's everything, it's now Life is short Bit by bit, laughter returns Along with joy, and oomph, and happiness I've learned there are lots of dumb people Who like to spread their hate That's how borders arise I've learned that the courage you give Becomes the love you get I've realized I don 't need 'ever more' Further, cooler is not for me I've learned to celebrate And to treasure what I have That's when an idea is sparked Like a cool wind, a new day A new idea is sparked And it brings light to the darkness And everything is now It's everything, it's now Life is short Bit by bit, laughter returns Along with joy, and oomph, and happiness Whatever you dream, you need to do it All the best things that you can Do it all, do it all Whatever you dream, you need to do it All the best things that you can Just do it, just do it And everything is now It's everything, it's now Life is short Whatever you dream You need to do it, just do it All the best that you can And everything is now Where have I ended up here? And what is going on? Everybody's running or sleeping I just don 't know why I'm new here and wonder what it is you do When you're not in stress or trying to forget I just want to know, why you’re so angry Why you do this and not that Why everyone's missing something Come on, let's take off for somewhere And make it all OK If you don't know me, you're missing something Come, let me show you the world the way I like it If you hide yourself, you'll never be found Come along into my world If you don't know it You're missing something And if you know yourself You're in the circle I just want to know why you’re so alone Why almost nobody laughs and doesn't say hello And whenever I'm sad, l'll fly to the stars and back And whenever I'm alone l'll fly into space and try it there And if I'm ever sad If I'm ever sad If I'm ever sad I'll call into space
