in battling the Covid-19 pandemic, with thousands risking their lives to help others. Tragically, over 200 front line NHS health care workers have now died. But something disturbing has been happening. Two thirds of those health care workers who have died have been from black and minority ethnic groups. NEWS ANCHOR: Hundreds more medics have died, many from the Bame communities. I'm Dr Ronx Ikharia and I work as an emergency medicine doctor in an east London hospital. I'm proud to work within the NHS and I feel privileged to provide front line care during this pandemic. We are now in the second deadly wave, and black and brown people like me deserve answers. MATT HANCOCK: People are angry about racial injustice, and I get that. Black lives matter. I've enlisted a group of experts to help explain what's going on. Take one. The Covid pandemic has certainly been discriminatory. We know that we're dying, we just need to see some action from government to keep us alive. The end result is in body bags. You can't argue with the body count. For the first time in my life, I was thinking, "Am I going to go to work? "Am I going to get on well? "And am I going to die?" This programme contains racially offensive language which viewers may find upsetting I'm shaking hands continuously... I was at a hospital the other night where I think there were a few...there were actually a few coronavirus patients, and I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands. It's early March, and whilst our prime minister is visiting Covid patients and shaking hands... ..nurse Areema Nasreen, a young British-Pakistani mother from Warsaw, contracted the virus. Look, everything there, where she left it. Her working in a hospital was her dream. Her daughter keeps it in her room. And I always tell her, "Do you want to put it in the wardrobe, away?" She said, "No, I want this close to me," because she said, "I can smell my mum." With first class honours, Areema Nasreen. CHEERING Areema turned her dream into reality just two years ago, graduating with first class honours. It was exciting for her to be starting in the NHS. She used to be so proud to go to work. When she got the uniform, there was like two different colours. Oh, my God. The day she got the uniform, she was like... She was wearing it all day. And she didn't even start that day. She was wearing it all day. But she had like a week to start, but she was just sinking it in, like, "Is it true?" And she kept phoning everybody and asking them, like, "How do I look? Look, I'm in blue." Cos she was in pink when she was a housekeeper. It was pink. Then she was white, and now she's blue. When the pandemic hit, Areema, like me, was in no doubt about her role. She said, "It's like a war. We're soldiers. "This is the front line. "So I'm going to go." And I said, "Oh, please, Areema, don't." She said, "But they're really short of staff." She wasn't going... There was nothing that would have stopped her. But despite her dedication, Areema was only three shifts in when she started to develop symptoms. In a matter of days, she was in an intensive care unit and put on a ventilator. Phone rang. She said, "Your sister's not well." And my younger sister, like, crying, she goes, "You're telling me Areema's dying?" They said yes. Her husband said, "At least let me see her now." He hugged her and said, "Areema, you'll be fine. "You'll see your kids and me when you wake up." And then she died in his arms. That was the worst day of our lives. Areema, NHS front line hero. Really lost without her. She's only 36 and something like this... ..took her. Areema was one of the first nurses to die of Covid-19, and her death marked the beginning of a disturbing trend. There does appear to be a disproportionate impact of the virus upon BME communities in the UK. The vast majority of NHS front line health care workers who are dying are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. There are no official figures for exactly how many have died. But from our own extensive research, we have found there to be over 200 in total, of whom around two thirds were from black and minority ethnic groups. Areema's family, and many more like them, need answers. Why are young, healthy, black and brown NHS workers like her dying? DR DARTH PATEL: Other people have looked to use genetics to explain what's going on. So, genetic factors. So, for example, say... Dr Ronx interview. Cameras A and B. In the beginning, we were told that black and minority ethnic people were dying. We were then told having black genetics is the reason why black people are contracting and dying from Covid-19. Winston. Cameras A and B. Take one. When the data started coming out, people sort of, if you like, focused on genetics as a possibility because it was affecting certain groups of people. And the obvious thing is to say, "Right, there might be a genetic link." I've come to the University of East London to meet Dr Winston Morgan. He's been looking into whether our genes could be playing a part in who's dying. So this is the data that got everyone excited. The raw data from the Office for National Statistics... Sure. ..which show that, if we compare white males to black males... Whoa! ..there was over four times more likely to die from Covid. As a scientist, I'm always curious, could there be a genetic factor? As I did my research, I found that genetics is important, but not genes linked to race. Race is basically a limited number of phenotypic characteristics. For example, skin colour, hair texture, facial features, those kinds of things. But none of those characteristics are linked to why you might be infected by Covid. Whether you're infected by Covid, once you or you encounter the virus, is going to be determined by your immune system, which is a totally different set of genes, nothing to do with the genes that determine your skin colour, for example. Got it. So, having melanin in my skin doesn't make me susceptible to contracting Covid-19? No. I've seen no evidence that genes linked to race are the reasons why black and non-white groups generally die from SARS-CoV-2. According to Winston, not only is the genetic argument flawed, but the data it's built upon makes problematic assumptions, like all black people share the same genetics. All black people were grouped in as one. So, for example, if you're an East African or West African, you'd be in the same group. If you're from the Caribbean... It didn't really matter where you were, as long as you were... ..you ticked the box. But all these groups are very different, and these groups aren't, if you like, scientific or genetic categories. They are social constructs. When you're talking about something like infection and death from Covid, which is a biological, these social constructs don't work. Mm-hm. With so many holes in this theory, I have to wonder, where did this notion come from in the first place? If you can say it's down to the genes that's making you more susceptible, then you don't have to address these structural problems. It absolves you of responsibility, basically. Yeah, yeah. "I am not responsible cos these are your genetics. "Therefore, you are vulnerable." Yeah. But this is not correct. No, it's not correct. But it's lets you off the hook, if you like. The pandemic has highlighted real flaws in grouping together different ethnicities with different genetics. In response to these concerns, the government are now planning on recording ethnicity on death certificates to gain a clearer picture. So future studies might be more enlightening, but it's not going to save any lives in this second wave. And it doesn't help Areema's family understand why she died. To lump all black people, or people with melanated skin, into one category as black... ..it felt lazy. And I think it's really important that black and minority ethnic people understand that the virtue of the colour of your skin does not mean that you are predetermined to get Covid-19. But if these excess deaths aren't down to something happening inside of us, could it be outside forces at play? REPORTER: The ONS found that, when age was taken into account, black people are four times more likely to die than their white counterparts. Bangladeshis and Pakistanis, three and a half times more likely to die. Right across the world, people are angry about racial injustice. And I get that. Black lives matter. I'm on the hunt for answers about why huge numbers of black and ethnic NHS workers are dying from Covid-19. I've learned that genetics linked to race is unlikely to be to blame. So what is going on? Frankly, this coronavirus doesn't discriminate, but... We're being told that, when it comes to the pandemic, we're all in this together. But what happens when the playing field isn't level in the first place? I want to understand how, in Britain today, our health is impacted by our wealth. Nearly half of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis live in poverty. 30% of Bangladeshis live in overcrowded housing, and 15% of black Africans live in overcrowded housing, compared to just 2% of the white population. Additionally, we know that large numbers of BAME people are working in insecure employment, on zero-hour contracts, are self-employed sole traders. For them, not working, you know, means they may not have the resources to put food on the table for their families. What's that? That's the pork. Get the seasoning on. Get the seasoning on. Aalijah, what's Mum's favourite food? Nduma and rice. And I'd mix it every day before she went to work. Mum told me that you should clean the rice out until the water looks a bit clearer. Cos when the water's white, that means that the rice is still dirty. 55-year-old Josiane Ekoli worked as an agency nurse to provide for her five children - Naomie, Aaron, Jean-Claude, Kenan and 16-year-old Aalijah. She'd always been a very, very hard worker. She'd, like, go on night shift, come home, get changed, drop us off at school or whatever, go do shopping. She'd be up until one, two, and then go to sleep and wake up to get ready to go to work again. Mm. So a proper strong worker. Like, I feel like that made her happy. Knowing that she can help someone, she can do something about it, made her happy. Not only was she the main provider for us, but for her family as well. Which is why she probably decided to carry on working. Yeah. Shame... As the pandemic gathered pace, Josiane was pulling long shifts on a Covid ward. Then she started feeling unwell. It just went really, really quickly. Like, her temperature just wouldn't go, she started feeling, like, worse and worse. And you could start seeing, like, her breathing would change and stuff like that. So... Yeah. And then she said, "No, I'm really not feeling well. "Call the ambulance. I can't do it any more." SIREN WAILS She went in and then I get a message, "Oh, I'm going into ICU, but I'm all right." It was like, "OK..." And then Mum is, like, on the deathbed. Like, dying. MONITOR BEEPS RESPIRATOR RASPS The family never got to see their mum again. Josiane passed away just four days after going into ICU. And even now it feels like it happened... One day, she went in. Then, literally the next day, she passed away. Mm. Mm. She didn't feel like she was being protected and they weren't doing enough to find a solution to protect her. She didn't know who she could turn to and be like, "I'm worried about myself and the kids. "I don't want to work." So it's either you do it or you don't - you can go home - but you're not getting paid. She didn't have another choice. So she just went ahead and did it. Because they weren't going to put her on furlough. We know that black and ethnic minority workers are less likely to have been furloughed if they had asked for it. So coronavirus has shone a light on existing inequalities in a way that hasn't ever happened before, I would say. Dr Halima Begum is the director of the UK's largest think-tank on racial equality. And, according to her, when it comes to Covid-19, we're certainly not all in it together. What we're seeing, and the evidence is showing us, is that it's an overexposure to the risks externally that is causing BME groups to suffer more deaths with Covid. Just to give you an example, BME workers are more likely to be employed in the front line as key workers in the NHS. 38% of workers are actually black African, so it's more likely that they would be overexposed, so their death rates are higher. BME families are more likely to be living in households that are overcrowded, so there's no chance to shield. Bangladeshi families living in overcrowded households in Tower Hamlets, where we're sitting today. So even if you did contract Covid, your ability to be resilient and be protected is quite limited. These are not comorbidities. These are environmental factors. SIREN WAILS It's not good enough that we overall are a high-income country. Out measure of development should be our ability to close the gap between those who are most able to keep healthy and the most vulnerable in society. And, as long as we have this wide gap, I don't think we can call ourselves developed in any way. Everybody deserves and has a right to good health. If I was Prime Minister or in charge of this country and somebody said to me that there was a group of people who were vulnerable to Covid-19 and were dying at disproportionate rates, I would want to know why. REPORTER: Worshippers joined to mark the first day of Eid, the festival that traditionally means gathering and celebrating with family and friends. That now can't happen. So we know BAME groups are some of the poorest in society and more likely to work in exposed roles such as on the NHS front line. But instead of taking action to protect these groups in the first place, some communities feel that the Government's actions have only served to make racial divisions worse. Households meeting and a lack of social distancing is one of the causes of this rising rate of coronavirus. It's 9:16pm on the night before Eid, one of the most important festivals in the Islamic calendar. And Matt Hancock announces that gatherings between separate households could not now take place. Many in the Muslim community felt scapegoated. The voice we can hear is Craig Whittaker, Conservative MP for Calder Valley in West Yorkshire. He's being interviewed about why cases in his area are so high. RADIO HOST: Blimey, this could get you... It's attitudes like that, Halima says, are making a bad situation even worse. It's playing divide and rule within our communities again, isn't it? Instead of taking responsibility for protecting our communities better, communities that are vulnerable, that are fragile, they were fragile before Covid... Instead of looking at ways to protect our vulnerable communities, we're looking to blame them. It is not the fact that people from black and minority ethnic communities are not wearing masks, or genetics to why we are vulnerable to Covid-19. A lot of it is because of the difficult life situation that people live in, which predisposes Covid-19, which means that they just can't make the adaptations needed to be safe. It feels as though that these vulnerabilities aren't necessarily being addressed. Government hasn't accepted to this day that BME groups are vulnerable groups within the Covid disease. They still haven't accepted it. We know why we're dying. We know that we're dying. We just need to see some action from government to keep us alive. Here we are, six months on, and the proportion of people fighting for their lives in intensive care units who come from a BAME background has not changed since April. So what needs to be done? What are the solutions that you're thinking of? You would make sure that black and minority front line workers are less exposed. Mm. You would make sure that when those communities are shielding at home, they actually have better resources to shield, for example. You would make sure that the funding is equitable. I don't understand how we can provide £10 billion for national test and tracing, but only 300 million for local test, tracing, shield and protect. The solutions are straightforward. You just have to have the political will to enable the measures to take place. Why is the Government not ploughing resources into protecting black and minority ethnic people? And, to add salt to an already dirty wound, it feels as though black and minority ethnic people have been blamed for catching Covid and dying from it in the first place. That's ridiculous. And, out of all our BAME health care workers, there is one group who seem to be particularly hard hit - the migrants propping up our NHS. Yesterday, we saw the biggest rise in daily cases since the pandemic began. We've also had a tragic increase in the number of daily deaths. We can expect many more daily deaths. Many of those who've died who are from the NHS were people who came to this country to make a difference. And they've given their lives in sacrifice, and we salute. NEWSREEL: They came at the invitation of the British government. The NHS has suffered from staff shortages since its early days. So to plug the gap, it relies heavily on an immigrant workforce. They were citizens of British colonies or newly independent Commonwealth countries. It started with the Windrush generation in the 1950s when medics were invited here from the Commonwealth. Their passports were stamped "definite leave to remain". And it continues today with large-scale recruitment drives in places such as Southeast Asia. Nurse Via Salinasal left the Philippines five years ago to come and work in the world-class NHS. My dad told me that's the best career move for me, to take up nursing, because I didn't come from like a well-off family. We were relatively just scraping above the poverty line. But I thought that that would give me a good life. Like many Filipino workers, Via sends much of the money she makes here back home to her parents and her son. It's not like they come here and then we're like millionaires. But after your parents have sent you to school, it's your time to take care of them. And if you are wise, if you're really hard working, yeah, we get extra shifts. And that's where, like, yay, a bit more extra on the side, to send money home. The Philippines is the number one source of foreign nurses worldwide, and Via is one of more than 22,000 Filipinos working in the NHS. So I've come to meet Francis Fernando, founding director of the Filipino Nurses Association UK... Francis! ..to find out how they've been affected. I'm cold, but really nice to meet you. And you too. Nice to meet you, too. Yeah. I know a lot of Filipino nurses. I love my Filipino nurses. Yeah. What's going on for Filipino people working within the NHS? So I am surprised that a lot of my colleagues have died due to Covid-19, not only nurses, but majority of them were nurses. Why is this happening? So they're probably doing a lot of work, a lot of shifts, a lot of hours in the front line to be able to send money back home. We have to pay for our visas, which of course are through work. FADING: So we have to work extra hard and, you know, to hear stories like... According to Francis, it was early in the pandemic, in late April, that saw Filipino nurses hardest hit. And how many Filipinos staff working within the NHS have died during this Covid pandemic? It was more than 20% at one point. More than 20% of health care workers that died during this pandemic of Covid-related illnesses were Filipino?! At one point. SHE SIGHS I mean, if I was a Filipino nurse, I would be scared for my life. We brought in the NHS visa precisely to be able to attract people from around the world to work in the NHS. Tragically, a disproportionate number of those in the NHS who died are people who came to make their lives here and to work in the NHS and have given their lives working in the NHS. My admiration for them is, uh... ..is...is unparalleled. We are a subservient people, you know. That's why we are being taken advantage of. It's in our culture, really, that we do extra work. We don't say no when our managers ask us to do extra shifts. We came here to work. We don't expect to die from work. It's hard to know if Filipino nurses in particular are being exploited. What I do know, working with Filipino nurses, is that they are possibly the kindest, nicest, caring group of individuals that I have met. Via travelled to the UK with her childhood best friend, Kenneth Lambatan, who also worked as a nurse for the NHS. ON VIDEO: Yellow represents happiness. And Kenneth is always happy! SHE LAUGHS He's really got this big personality. If I were to describe Kenneth in one word, it's gay. He's very animated, he's a bit loud. Sometimes I go, "Sh, sh! "You know this is a decent place." OVERLAPPING INDISTINCT DIALOGUE Via and Kenneth were just about to move into a flat together. Then the pandemic struck. When we heard the Covid, Kenneth and my other friend were quite scared. BORIS JOHNSON: The chances of dying from coronavirus are actually very low. I was like, "Shouldn't we be worried? "Cos it's slowly creeping into Europe." We nominated each other as next of kin, but we were...we're just 33. We didn't think we were going to die. As a research nurse, Kenneth was told that he would be able to work from home. But as the virus spread, nurses were moved to areas of most need. He texted us that he was going to be put in a ward. He was just wearing the surgical mask at that point, and I remember being quite worried. And three days after he messaged us saying that, "Guys, I have fever. I have cough." And I said, "Oh, my Kenneth, I think you have it, don't you think?" And he was like, "No, just please pray for me." Kenneth isolated himself at home, keeping in touch with Via by text, but suddenly the texts stopped. Then she got a call. It was an unknown number, so I just picked it up, and on the other line was Kenneth. He was, he literally just said these words, "I am Kenneth Lambatan. I am in St George's neuro ICU. "They will intubate me now." And I was shocked. Every day we're just waiting for an update, hopefully good news that I can bring to his family, but it just seemed that it was just getting worse, and... ..and I remember telling my friend, "Kenneth has got a story to tell when he wakes up." Via was eventually allowed to visit her friend. Seeing him on the bed, I wanted to pray for a miracle that he would somehow, even if they switch off everything, that he would somehow, I don't know, just survive it. When he flat-lined, I felt for his pulse, and he was not breathing anymore, and I remember telling the family that he's gone, and... Their cries just made my pain almost insignificant because, at least, I was there. For one particular ethnic group to be hit so hard is unbelievable. So, why is this happening? I believe that some of our members are not treated fairly. I believe that they really don't have a choice. They are fearful that if they don't follow what their managers are asking them to do, they'll probably be not renewed, and the visas won't be extended. So, those are the main concerns, or worries, that they have, and the government really needs to get their acts together, really, and learn from the first wave of this pandemic. We asked the government what they were doing to protect BAME health care workers like our Filipino nurses. A government spokesperson said that they are ensuring updated guidance is available for employers on protecting their workforce with 95% of front line NHS staff from ethnic minority backgrounds having now had a coronavirus risk assessment. It took about two months before we had a national risk assessment policy. There needs to be much more support to those who are at highest risk in the BAME community. We've seen our ministers come out and say that we're going to have risk assessments, and they tell us a lot of promises, but these just seem to be tick box exercises. I want to see action. Unfortunately, there are still stories out there that even though it has been made mandatory by NHS England, people's risk assessments are still not being done or carried out with the employees. Do you feel abandoned? We definitely feel abandoned. We feel taken advantage of. We feel that, erm, we're not valued. A lot of people have died already, and we don't want any more deaths from our communities. So, that's why we have the Philippine Association to empower our colleagues and for them to assert their rights. I've learned that nurses from the Philippines are actively recruited into the NHS to fill nursing shortages. These nurses, these Filipino nurses, are paying thousands and thousands of pounds on visas to remain here. But at one point during the pandemic, 20%, and that's one fifth of health care deaths due to COVID-19, were from Filipino backgrounds, and if this is NOT the definition of neglect from the powers that be, I don't know what is. But there's something I still don't understand. If it's our poorer BAME workers that are most vulnerable, why are vast numbers of well-paid, well-educated doctors dying, too? Something else must be going on. This programme contains racially offensive language which viewers may find upsetting. OK, guys, welcome. Today, new research confirms that those from an Asian background are one and a half times more likely to get the disease, and if you're black you are twice as likely to become infected than if you're white. I've learned so far that there's a clear link between health and wealth in the UK, and it's scandalous how overrepresented BAME people are in lower income roles. But when it comes to my NHS colleagues, this is not the whole picture. Better paid doctors, like me, are also dying, and the numbers here are starkest of all, with 90% of those who have died being black or brown. There must be something else at play here. Hi, Chand. How are you? I'm meeting Dr Chaand Nagpaul to find out what it might be. Chaand, how did you feel in that first wave? I was shocked. I was alarmed. You know, we'd never seen figures like this before. The first ten doctors who died of Covid were all from a black and ethnic minority background. Now, that that defies all the statistics, even though we have a high proportion of doctors from a BAME background in the NHS, but for 100% of them to all have died from Covid was alarming. And so we ran surveys throughout the pandemic. Three times as many doctors from a black and ethnic minority background told us they felt under pressure to see patients without adequate protection. Now, that's quite a striking statistic. So why were they in that position? I think there's no doubt that for far too long we have had a health service that has not treated everyone equally, that has resulted in some sectors of our workforce experiencing excessive levels of bullying, harassment. And doctors from a black and ethnic minority background are scared in many cases to speak out. And they feel that if they speak out, they will be blamed for factors outside their control. The evidence all shows, and the living experience of doctors shows that there is structural race inequality throughout the NHS. We have a national health service that the nation depends on on a daily basis to look after them. And its bedrock is the contribution of black and ethnic minority doctors and nurses. But we don't have proper equal opportunity. We don't have equality of progression of individuals. And that's certainly the case in the health service, but also in society more widely. The whole idea of racism and the whole idea of subtle racism, especially, it's not a physical feeling. It's a visceral feeling that brings about a lot of pain, that not everybody can describe and not everybody can explain. Married doctors Nishant and Meenal both work for the NHS. When the pandemic hit, they were working on the front line and expecting their first child. As a pregnant doctor at that time, I had many concerns. Working in an acute setting was the first one. The second one was the changing guidelines. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to wear a mask, because we were we were short on supply at the time, and I just was so confused. I wasn't sure what I needed to protect myself. And then something happened that changed everything for Meenal. REPORTER: Channel 4 News has learned that a 28-year-old nurse who had tested positive for Covid-19 died here on Sunday. One of the nurses from Nishant's hospital, Mary Agyapong, contracted Covid-19. Just a little bit. She was 35 weeks pregnant. OK. Mary would always want you to feel comfortable. Her smiles always brightened her family as well. I think her friends would call her selfless. She was always protective, caring, a loving mother. Ten in the morning, going to work. Look at this one. Hi, bubs. Look. This one doesn't even want to sleep. He's following me around. Like, for real. Let me give you a little bit, OK? That's it. For her husband, Ernest, being a dad is more work than he ever imagined. It's not been easy, looking after a toddler and a little baby all by myself. Is it a house? Yeah, it is a house. And it is her house? Yes. Let me check... Yeah. I still have to make sure that my kids still get the best that mummy would have given to them. Aw, thank you. Come, Daddy give you a kiss. Mwah! Thank you, Daddy. You're welcome. Mary had become worried about going to work, but she carried on doing long shifts. She was classed as a high risk pregnant young lady. She had to also still go and do 12-hour, 13-hour shifts, you know... ..standing, which I believe wasn't fair to her. With just weeks to go until her baby was due, Mary developed symptoms. I realised that she was struggling for breath, and later on that day her results came in positive. So the doctors made a decision to take the baby out. Mary delivered a healthy baby girl by C-section, but shortly after, her own health deteriorated. She died just days after giving birth and never got to hold her baby. We were confident in the NHS, so, yeah, we believed in the system and we were confident that this was going to pass... ..and we would get back to our normal life, you know, but things didn't go as we expected. To know that a pregnant health care worker had died, in the same place where she was trying to save lives, just really, really hit home for me. At that time, I wasn't the only pregnant health care worker in my trust that I knew - I spoke to lots of other women as well. But they were saying that if we speak up, we might lose our job. But then I thought that if Mary lost her life because she didn't speak up, who's going to be her voice? And that's when I told Nishant that we need to do something about this now. Less than a week after Mary died Meenal arrived at the gates of Downing Street. I was terrified. But at the same time, also I had this energy inside me that I'm actually going out to do something, to be the voice for Mary. Nearly seven months pregnant, she stood for hours with her placard, hoping her silent protest would speak volumes. Nishant and Meenal are clear - issues with lack of PPE and preparation put the NHS at risk, but the reason BAME NHS front line workers were in danger was down to structural inequality. In terms of us dying - us black and brown people dying - why do you think this is happening? Racism. It's years and years, and decades and decades, and centuries and centuries of in-built racism. I think it has to be said in really explicit terms, just to really paint out, it's really difficult to say this act was racist because nobody uses the N-word any more, nobody calls us Pakis like they used to. But those people didn't disappear. They became our bosses. If I our speaking up starts a conversation, if it creates even just 1% of a change, we're going in the right direction. We asked the Secretary of State for Health to take part in this programme and address these issues. He declined. Instead, he sent a statement: Black Lives Matter! Coming in, coming in. Remember we're in a pandemic. The Government's race disparity unit said ethnicity should no longer be used to judge whether people were at risk, and that structural racism played no part. But this very Government commission, set up to tackle these inequalities in our society, recently said that ethnicity and structural racism are not factors that should be considered when deciding who needs help. The Public Health England report was very clear that there were structural factors that resulted in race inequality affecting the black and ethnic population. We're now told that these structural factors have not played a part, when they patently have done according to so much independent analysis. Nothing is being done. And now we have to ask, do you really care that those from ethnic minorities are dying? Do you really care? The end result is in body bags. You can't argue with the body count. How do we say it? When we talk about race, racial inequality, racial bias, institutional racism, structural racism... ..people get uncomfortable. People don't necessarily want to address issues that have... ..er...a racial feel. Covid in itself as a virus is not racist. But what it has done is illustrated that there are racial biases within this country that have existed... ..and been neglected and ignored. And people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are scared. Here we go. On the one hand, we clap for our NHS, but on the other, we are not doing enough to protect those who prop it up. And it would be nice if somebody from the Government just acknowledged that there have been failings and tell us how they are going to help make sure that this doesn't happen again. We have got an opportunity to learn from the deep rooted problems exposed by the first deadly wave, but if we can't face up to this now, I'm worried more will die and my colleagues' lives may have been in vain.
