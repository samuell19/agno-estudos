* 3 WINCHESTER SHOTS, FOR RINGO * Welcome! Here is the gold! And the rest? When you finish the job! How much do you owe us, yet? 100 ounces, as we agreed! Not an animal. That was our agreement! Enough! Stop it! I hope our arguments are convincing, Walcom! If you do not give us the amount we ask for, we will take your life, and that of your Mexicans! They do not want my gold, nor do they use weapons! I have nothing to hide! We are not interested in your work! We will be back soon. Have the gold ready then. Goodbye! Goodbye! Now you will see, cursed! Hold on! What do you want, to order 7 more coffins? This one here, this is Ringo, this is the Texan! Ah, at? que enfim! We are sleeping, all right Tom? Of course, Ringo, all. Everything! Did you do the right thing? Yes, but I forgot what to do when you pass me. You will wait for our slogan, as you did in River City! In River City? Do you remember? Yes! I remember! We had a hot dance with the Mexicans! I'm going on a shift, Miguel! Wait here! I'll come pick you up! I found them, Ringo! Get a horse! Let's bet $ 100 that they won't bring Jane back to you; Well paid, they will return! What if the Mexicans give them more? Are you sure you want to meet them again? Ringo and the Texan are honest gunmen... they never break their word, not like you! Manuel! Tell Mom Carson that Ringo is back! I run! Wallcom! You owe me $ 100. Forgive Jane for this small incident... Did they bother you? No, but I'm already quite teased, Dad! I have been taken hostage 5 times in the past. This makes me sick! Welcome back Miss Jane! Thanks! One day hostages of some robbers. Another time hostages of Mexicans! I do not want to be part of your business! Do not sell weapons, since you do not have them! You's right Jane. It will not happen again! Now, go up. I have to talk to the gentlemen! Hm!... So how much do I owe you? Didn't you hear? Repeat it! He will remember! Another 200 ounces, Wallcom! Truth? And if I decide... not to pay you? Enjoy the pistol! Stop! What's going on here, Wallcom? They want gold! Much more than we had agreed! This is not my job! I do not want the slightest fuss in the city! I am pleased to see that a banker has become a Sheriff! Ringo, are you sure the Sheriff died in an accident? A bank accident, right? Now is not the time to comment! For the good of the bank and my customers, I imposed the bank's interest peace in the city! Your customers... the company of the dead. Isn't that so Daniels? Let it be, Ringo! We are only interested in our gold! Pay the Walcoms! No, pay! Things went well. One, two, three, five, six, eight ... What was that? Six. Who taught you to steal? Are you stealing my daughter? No, Mr. Walcom! Correct measures! 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15. You see, Mr. Walcom, that's all! Fast I am not thief. I did not take anything! Okay, you lost! Good evening, I'm going! Always at your service! Night, Mr. Walcom! Back! As you wish, as you wish! Bye dad! I will be back soon! Good night, twice! Good night! Poor kitten, they left you alone; Hm!... Leave me, coward! Why do you want me to please you? You owe me gratitude, right? My father paid you well! I do not owe you anything! If it were not for Ringo in the middle, I would have saved you for free! Hm!... Try to understand it! I did not ask you to save me! I do not like your behavior! I like you! You are very beautiful, Jane! I have enough gold and I can make you very happy! Let me! I repeat it to you, Frank. I do not like you! I do not want you. Leave me alone! You're wrong, Jane. One day, you will regret it! Hello, Jane! Why did you put Frank in the carriage? Why, I am better at the pistol and I will cover your escape! Your friend is a usurper! Why usurper? It does not leave me alone! It's a bit of a mess! Would you do the same Ringo? If my father has no gold to give, you will you come and save me? Hm I do not think so! Get lost! Do you really want me to leave? No, no... I do not want to see you again! Remember Ringo, you will pay me this! I'm not like the others! I may live in these circles, but I am honest! And you are the only honest man I have ever met! What is? Do we have problems? Something wrong? I had enough Ringo! All you do is chase this woman! Ah!... Does this bother you? If you want something and you can not have it... then, no one should have it, eh Frank? Enough! Enough, Ringo! She is a woman! Let's take different paths! Good luck! Do you agree? Goodbye, Ringo! Agree. Good luck to you too! Goodbye! We were waiting for it, Ringo. Better this way! Mama Carson is looking for you! Go see her! This is not your job, Tom! When he threw me out of the house, he had said that it would be better for her! She wanted to be a tough woman! Let her rejoice in her loneliness. Since then, a long time has passed! I think you need it! Listen to me, and see her! Hm, no! She's your mother, Ringo! Come! Come here, Ringo! Sit down and listen to me! Like your son? No, are you still working as a gunslinger? Fine, then you can work for me! I will give you more than others would give you! Well, that's it! And how much will you give me mother? Enough to save me from Daniel's bank! I'm very expensive! You can not give me what I want! They were right. You have no consciousness left! We lost the freedom that your father gave to the city by giving his blood! You should have thought about it 3 years ago, when you threw me out, like a common thief! But it was your fault! Forget the past! I beg you, come back as the leader of this house! Come back, Ringo. Do it for your father! Will do it! My dear child, I knew you were good! What happened to your boyfriend Frank Saunders? We will not be together anymore. It is better like this! What are you going to do with Daniel? Do not worry, mom! Daniel is a coward who feels strong because he has the bank behind him! It will not bother us openly, now that I am with you! And mom... Yes! What would you say if I got married? Oh, very Ringo, marriage! You marriage? A dude, like you's getting married! Grandpa! What is? Was he born, or still? Yes! Boy or girl? Boy! He looks like me? No! But is he a Walcom? In fact, Mr. Walcom! What happened? Eh, stop it! Let's go download it! Forward, help me, slowly! Let's go! Carefully! Slowly! Take it now! Hold him! Ringo, some strays, attacked Merrill's estate as a group! We have to do something! Quick, get him in! Immediately to the horses! I will not be late, mom! Hey, hey... Bring me a dad federation hat! I will bring you! Ringo, we are ready! See you! Forward, throw! Run Ringo, a child is left at home! Oh, where is the door? That way! I do not see anything! Move on! Mom, mom! Let's clean it! Halt! Ringo! Was he hurt? Ringo is a sheriff! Ringo, it's me, Frank! Frank... My head... My eyes... I do not see! Calm down! I will be careful! We need a stretcher! Take care of it, Tom! I will do it as fast as I can! To your horses, let's go to Stone City! It is an isolated city. No one will make it difficult for us! Ringo! My son! Hit the head! He can not see! Call the doctor! Do not look at me like that! A star on the chest always causes problems, Jane Carson! The Texan... Ah!... I do not understand why he returned. The Texan is here! Tell Daniels the news! Wallcom! Hey, Frank! I have a long time to see you! However, the war has not changed you! I heard about Ringo, bad news! But I do not deal with Carson, by any means! They do not let me see my daughter. They say I am a scammer and a smuggler! But I do not care! What are you going to do now? I'm going back to River City! Badly. Ringo is blind now! It's the end of a lot of fuss. He can no longer be a Sheriff! I lost a lot of jobs as a Sheriff. On the other hand, a Sheriff like you... I'm Expensive Wallcom! You do not pay enough, my friend! We can compromise. Listen, Frank! We can talk about it, so Frank? It's a job! This city here is for such jobs, believe me! Oh, Daniels! It's Frank, the Texan! Gernas, Walcom! I know him! You haven't changed much, Texane! I will suggest you some cooperation! Not interested! I do not do errands! You are wrong, Texan! Listen to me! My bank was able to gather all the customers around the area. With the exception of 3 great things! What do you want to do together? Gold... Very gold! On the estates of... Mama Carson, Wise and Osborne... are the largest gold reserves in this country! He continued! I will make you a Sheriff! And from now on, you will not have any problems! Now you are clear! Maybe we do some collaboration! Jane? Doctor... He received a severe blow to the head! He lost his sight, unfortunately! You mean he will be blind? I have come across similar cases... In some cases, a shock restores vision. But it is a rare ending! First of all, give him some rest! He needs to sleep! Yes, thank you, doctor! Mum! Yes my child! In my situation... I think I can no longer protect you. No Ringo, we must support you. And you will give us the strength to continue! Dad, I will always be with you, and I will protect you! Give it to the telegraph office! You are now Sheriff Frank! You made a good choice! I do not think so. I want you to give me percentages too! Look at it, differently whenever we move weapons! Are you still digging Jane? Did you see Ringo again? No, I do not want to see him! I saved his life, and that was it! I'm with you now! Yes, I have no hesitation! No... but Frank, I... You're like a strong crocodile, Walcom! Since everything went well, we will not have any trouble! This is unacceptable! The citizens are gradually leaving the city! No one has the guts to resist Daniels's bank! Two good friends will give me the opportunity to pay my husband's debts. We will work together as colleagues, and Daniels will leave us alone! Definitely, this is how we feel stronger! So Mrs. Carson, we will accept your proposal! Do you agree? Agree! We will support each other! Do you agree with that Ringo? My opinion has nothing to do. What to say! I'm pushing to accept it. No Ringo, it's not true! You, my son, will keep the minutes of our agreement! Together, we fight Daniels to make our city the way it should be! As your father built it. A free city! Mama Carson has joined Wise and Osborne! The contracts were given to Ringo... who has kept them in an iron box! Give me what you owe me! Ringo keeps the contracts! Osborne and Wise, joined Carson! Let's go, there is no one! Give me the papers! Stay here. I will handle it, myself! It is dangerous! I told you to stay here! If anyone comes, I will open fire! This city became a nest of murderers. And you are their leader, Daniels! Although Osborne and Wise were murdered, I will give you my obligations! Here's the money for my husband's debts. Where did you find the money? This is not your job! Give me those papers! Very well! I'm happy about that! You are a stubborn woman, Mrs. Carson. Do you want fuss? We will find a compromise! I'm sorry, I'm not interested, Daniels! What a misfortune! You would help our bank, supporting... to utilize the gold of your estate! We will never do it. We know your methods! Perhaps these have the most chances. Yes, for someone who is afraid! Yes, you know Daniels, I accepted a lot in my life, but not usurpations! We will defend our interests. I warn you, we are not alone! We had no other choice! I want to get these contracts for any price! Send the men to Mama Carson... but I do not want them to kill her! There is no box of documents here! Let's look up! Someone is coming! Hide! Don't kill her! Hai! Son!... Jane, Mom! Get them! Maskers, help! Where are you? Aid! Let me! Put me down! Ringo! Jane! Mum! Ringo! Where are you? Jane! Ringo! Let me! Where are the documents? Ah!... Aid! Put me down! Jane! Ringo, Ringo! Mom, where are you? Let me in! No! Let me in! Jane! Once again, I will ask you. Where are those documents? You will never know! Speak! Fuck! No!... Ringo! Hm!... Aid! Cowards! Ringo... Ringo, get up! Ringo, help me!... Get out of here! No! Enough now! We have to get out of here! I do not want it to appear that we are looking for papers! Hyah!... go, go Hey, what's going on here? My God, Mom Carson! They killed her! Jane! Ringo! It's me, Tom! Ringo! My head! My head! Where is my mom? Where is? They shot her! Was he killed? Where is Jane? It will be fine, it's not here! Where are you! Calm down! Bring me Daniels! Sit quietly! Take me to Daniels, now! Sit down, Ringo! Take me to Daniels. Did you understand? Ringo... What the... Come here! Ringo! I can... and I see! I can see... I can see! No one should know! Don't tell Jane either! Yes Ringo, yes! Bring those weapons to the Valley of the Indians! My revenge will drown them! Among them was someone like a leech! Your mother's death deeply saddened me, Ringo! I will find the killers! You're... good sheriff and great gun! You will find them... alone, without Daniels! He is a banker, and he does not interfere in such cases! He must have bought you! No Jane, you are wrong! Unjustly accusing me! I'm friends with Ringo! I started investigating the case, and I will find them! You will have my gratitude, Texan! There it is! He... the leech, and their leader! They were the ones who killed your mother! And for this reason, we will kill them, Ringo! I'm coming, together! No, I will go alone! Hey, you idiot! You have guts! What are you doing here? Do you want to share your mother's bitter fate? They did not pay us to kill you! Why are you wandering around without your wife? We found these 3 corpses on the road! We were detecting outside the city... Detection... I would say horse thieves! Did the Carsons do it? But who? Ringo does not see! Anyway. We have to find out where he has hidden the documents! We will not find them easily. Ringo is smart! Time flies, Daniels! This is the last telegram sent by the army! They have been notified by the landowners, who demand an investigation! Strong friends will take care of them! I got an idea! Every year, one of the Carsons contributes to the celebration. This year, Mr. Brett will be present. In my mother's place! Thank you, Mrs. Carson! Dad, take me with you! No Ringo, listen, he is very small! He will stay home! He understands very well! Tom, get him up! Something is happening to you since that night, I do not understand! You are no longer yourself! What can I do about it? Tell me! Nothing, Jane! What to do? Nothing! Let them finish the party. Then notify. Stop it! Help, no, no. Dad help! Dad help! Protect with Dad! No daddy. Dad Save me daddy! No no no! No no. Dad! Aid! Help me! No! Dad, save me! Mom! Save me! No no! He can see us! He fooled us! Run, Willie! Hide! You would have killed him! Why didn't you shoot? That was your order! Ringo's death is yours too! And yours too! Without these documents... my bank... go bankrupt! I have no money left! Find him! Willie! Willie get out! Do not shake, okay? I will come to get you! Did you understand? Now hide! Ringo, wait for me in the Valley of the Indians! Jane Carson! Jane Carson! Jane, where are those documents? No... I do not know Where is Ringo? Ringo left. He found his light again! He could see. He fooled you! Your son is hiding but we will find him! And we will kill him if you do not speak! You will not find Willie! So glad Ringo can see! He can see again, and you are afraid because you betrayed him! He will avenge the death of his mother. You are a worm, worm! A worm! Hm!... You are a stupid woman! What can 2 men do against us Attack all over the city to save you and your son. Are you crazy! Hm!... If you could understand how much I love you? How I always wanted you! I could save your son! Do not touch me. Get lost! Disappear! Are you smart, old man? Are you playing with your life? She is my daughter! I'm sorry, Frank! I lost my mind! Here are the weapons! I am waiting for your slogan! Hands up! Oh, you are Walcom, sorry! How can you be more and more stupid, Pacquito? Run, go up! Shake, run! Willie! Willie! Where did they hide him? Willie, get out now! Oh!... Come on, Willie, get out! No! The no forgot it. Get out of there! Willie! You are a brave boy! For sure? Why are you looking at me like that? Speak! You are on the side of our enemies! No... No Willy, no! Ought... I had to do it, to save myself! Willie, you have your mother's eyes! You behaved badly, Grandpa! What did you say? What did you say? Grandpa! This is the first time you call me that! Grandpa... Calm down my child, everything will be fine! All this will soon be over. Your dad will be back! Everything will go well! What about mom? Do not worry. They are holding her hostage! If they intend to harm her, I will be ready to protect her! Hello, Willie! See you! Hello! Hello, grandfather! Hello! Hello, Grandpa! I heard that they will attack tonight, and Frank will lead them! We will trap them in the cave. There we will have a better place to fight! There are still some things left over from the war inside the cave! Things that will save us! What are these? Will you find a surprise if they work? Jane, Daniels wanted to kill you, but I stopped him! If Ringo gives you the documents, he will save you... Your son will also be saved! Willie, you will never find him! Your father is hiding it. I will not tell anyone! But think about it, Jane. No one can take... control of the city by Daniels! Everything is under his control, don't you see? Everyone was pressured to give up! You would get rich if you came with me, and not with Ringo! Come with me! Jane, I love you! I love you! Let me go! No! Let me! Jane! Do not touch me! Do not touch me! Since you do not want me, I will not touch you! Tonight, I will catch Ringo, and maybe you will change your mind! Texan! Damn, bastards! Come on! This is our last hope! There are too many! This once saved us! Do you still remember how it works? Maybe yes! Maybe not, we'll see! Front! Let's go! Let's go! We are retreating! The gunpowder is over! Take care of the injured. Send more men to the valley! Okay! Let's go guys! It is unlikely to find Ringo in this valley. I lost a lot of men! Because, you do not use your mind! You are not decisive and you are wasting time! No, Daniels! This is not true! Our cooperation is going well! You protected your life... like no other! My interests are confused, Daniels. Trust me. I am not going to betray you! We'll see about that, Wallcom! Now, listen to me, Frank! We have one day left to pressure Ringo to give us the documents. The day after tomorrow, the army will be here. We will have to face many problems for who you are! For you, the same and worse, Daniels! And for your bank! Dear Alonso... you will do a good job with the banker, Daniels! He is a fine boss! Will you get a cigar? If you forward, a message to Ringo, you will be richly rewarded! I only have one boss, death! And so far, I'm fine with my boss! How much will I get? $ 100. He!... They are not enough! Nobody came back alive, Of those who faced Ringo! $ 150. Do you agree? Agreed. No... Give them to my future widow! What do you want to say to Ringo? Ah, what a nice welcome... as I expected. Throw away your gun. However, it is not full! And keep your hands up! I am ready! What do you want? Me? Nothing! Daniels, the banker... remember, the envoy is not responsible he says... he will kill your wife if you do not give up! And Walcom, your dear father-in-law... says that Willie, your son, is safe for now! And that is on your side. But Daniels has a suspicion that something is wrong. I am done! Throw it at him! Hey, stop, why? Do you want to kill me? Here it is! Ah, you see? He understands! Is smart! I am very cunning and I could be useful to you! I will tell you how the attack will take place... for a little delivery! Put him in hiding! And make him talk! Can I lower my arms? Download them! To lift my hat? Catch it! But this is for me! Trochadin! Listen ... What do you say you can find us dynamite? Yah!... Yah, for a few dollars... What is your plan now? Yah, Alonso, he did a good job! Do you remember everything? All! Now Ringo, I want to say goodbye! Maybe we will never get angry again. You never know! Do not worry old buffalo. We will meet again! Good luck! Good luck to you too! Where is the boy? Where is Daniels? In the living room! Ringo is coming! We'll take care of you later, bastard! Now Sheriff... this is our last chance to be saved! Press Ringo to give us the documents! Give it to us first, because with the papers it is dangerous! Check yourself! Time passes. I will force him, be sure of that! Trust me! Ringo go! They are waiting for you! They want to kill you, Ringo! Do not care about me! Go and be saved Ringo! Go to be saved! Uh, uh!... Front! Do not kill him. Wait for it to leave the ammunition! Quick gentlemen. Jane, run! Mum! Willie! Come quickly. Below! Sit down! Ringo, cover! Texan! I was waiting for you! I dare you! Where are the documents? Look to find them! Do you prefer to die for documents? What do you think? My life and gold! I'm not interested in your gold! What duel do you want? The one with the 8 bullets! Are you ready? I'm ready! Well, that's how Texane explained? You played with your life, like crazy! Think of yourself Ringo. Give me the papers! Three bullets of Winchester, at Mama Carsons. They will take revenge on us! Ringo! I would never kill you Ringo. Watch out Ringo, from there Daniels! Daniels, Daniels! Ringo! Grandpa! "THE END"
