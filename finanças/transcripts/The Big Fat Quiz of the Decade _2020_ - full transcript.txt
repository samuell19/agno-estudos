This programme contains strong language and adult humour. Hello and welcome to The Big Fat Quiz Of The Decade, or, as it's known in these more woke times, The Beautiful Big-Boned, Celebrating-Its-Curves Quiz Of The Decade. Funny, exciting and beloved by the nation, but enough about me, let's meet the teams. She's a talented, charismatic, universally loved TV star and he's, I assume, her dad - it's Stacey Solomon and Jonathan Ross! I mean, we look the same age. He hosts a show full of current affairs, she hosts a show full of marital affairs. It's Nish Kumar and Claudia Winkleman! And, between them, they are respectively the funniest thing to come out of Birmingham and the funniest thing to come out of the dentist's office - it's Joe Lycett and Alan Carr! Not nice! Not nice. Not nice. You leave my wife alone. Yeah! Hit him. Joe, hit him. Punch him. Yes! Oh, he really connected. Have you got, like, decade-themed team names? Have you got a team name? What have you got, Jonathan? Well, initially, I came up with an idea which I thought was much more to do with what's going on now. I thought, because we're kind of sticking together and we're always here and you can't get rid of us whether you want to or not I thought, we'd call ourselves The Unimpeachables. Right? But we're not going with that, because when I suggested that to Stacey she said no. Give us the reason. Because I really like peaches. I feel like it gives the wrong impression. Yeah. Yes, I think a lot of people would watch and think, "Ah, Stacey Solomon doesn't like peaches." Exactly. And then where are you going to be? Exactly. So, what we've settled on is, we've been talking about the period we're focusing tonight and we're both big fans - we're genuinely big fans - of this young man. We are. So we're going to call ourselves... The Beliebers. Jason Bieber, the true Beliebers, over here. We are. Jason Bieber? Yeah, that's how big a fan I am! I'm sorry about saying... I'm sorry about earlier when I said you were Stacey's dad. I think grandad is more appropriate. OK, The Beliebers. Claudia, Nish, what have you got? You're in charge of this. We're called Dexit Means Dexit. This is the end of the decade and we're exiting the decade and if we've learned one thing in this decade it's that if you say something means something it's not just a great thing to say it's a completely viable way to run a government. Alan, Joe, what have you got? Lads, Lads, Lads, because that's what we are. Isn't it, Joe? Yeah, we're a trio of lads. So, how's your decade been? I've got a picture of you 10 years ago, Jonathan. Let's have a look. This is how you looked 10 years ago. Wow. You look like Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. OK, so, Stacey, ten years ago. I mean... Aw! ALAN: Look at that! I've got a picture of Claudia ten years ago. I mean... JONATHAN: Looks the same. It's EXACTLY the same. I was just worried you'd found a photo of me where I wasn't orange. But don't panic. I was. Now, Nish. You do not look like the same human. You can see the decade on my face. Here's Alan. Here's you 10 years ago. Oh, no. Don't. And that's when you were working as a Basil Brush tribute act? Look at that. I would not feel embarrassed about that for one second because... ..Joe Lycett 10 years ago! Treat yourselves, everyone. Yeah! I've got to say. Joe, I think you were a very pretty little girl. Let's get on with the show. Our first round is all about the decade's top news stories. So let's remind ourselves what we lived through. Environmentalists described the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill as the worst environmental disaster in centuries, which left Chernobyl residents rolling their eyes. All three of them. In 2012, a spate of celebrity tax scandals hit the headlines. Personally... LAUGHTER Well, wait for it! Personally, I had my annus horribilis, which is Latin for "I shat myself." OK, so, questions on the headlines from the decade. OK. First up, take a look at this clip from BBC News. All I want to know is, what 2015 news story was the reporter trying to recreate? And, having made the holes, we couldn't resist seeing how easy it was to actually get through. I'm told it's possible. It looks very, very, very tight. I'm also told the best way to do it is to use the Superman pose, so I'm going to put my right hand through first... ..work my way through. T-That's very tight. Struggling to get my second hand through. Er... If you could just push from behind? Someone might need to give me a bit of a push. OK. I've got my hand out now. Once that hand's out... ..it's possible... ..to crawl out. There you are. I-I need a lot more information than just that. So, what new story was he recreating...? That's what I'm asking you. That's what you're asking me?! Yeah. Yeah, Jimmy, how do you like it when you get a questioned? It's question one! Just, like, act it out a bit more. Yeah. Where are they? You've got it, right, Jonathan? We've got it. I'm on Jonathan's team. OK. Next. What 2013 scandal prompted a surge in sales of home meat grinders and mincers, wiped 300 million from Tesco's market value and was described by David Cameron as, "A shocking story." That could have been our team name! Grinders and Mincers. Oh! Shit! Would you like to change it? Can we change it? Yeah, Grinders And Mincers. No. Lads, Lads, Lads is a bit... No, it makes me sound a bit gay. I'm very masculine, actually. Are you sticking or switching? I think Grinders And Mincers is funnier. Can we change it? Grinders And Mincers. Grinders And Mincers it is. It wouldn't be The Big Fat Quiz if we didn't have an appearance from the children of Mitchell Brook Primary School. Here they are performing one of their very special school plays. Work, work, work. We're trapped! OH, NO! Mr President, there's been an accident! We must rescue everyone. We're through! YEAH! They will need these. 31... ..32... ..33. We have saved everyone! YEAH! So that was the children of Mitchell Brook Primary School obviously recreating the Chilean miners being rescued. Oh, was that not a question? No, because we thought that was pretty easy. Oh, come on! I've wrote it down! "The miners were rescued. Yay." We've already put that answer down. We've no space. Oh, no. We haven't done the question yet. Well, you need to explain that, Jimmy! OK, well, here's the question. One of the miners, Johnny Barrios, wasn't met by his wife of 28 years when he finally emerged from the mine. Can you remember why? Oh! Why was Johnny's wife not there to meet him? OK. In 2010, a natural phenomenon caused Miley Cyrus to miss the London premiere of her film, John Cleese to pay £3,000 for a taxi ride CLAUDIA GROANS and David Attenborough... I thought fire alarm had gone off! What was that? That was when we both knew something and worked it out without speaking. Yeah, and the thing we knew was the answer to your goddamn question. You're like a Nutribullet with a fringe. That's the best thing anybody has ever said to me. Let's hear it again, Jimmy. OK. All right. In 2010, a natural phenomenon caused Miley Cyrus to miss the London premiere of her film, John Cleese to pay £3,000 for a taxi ride and David Attenborough to become trapped in the Arctic Circle. What was it? What happened? Look at David Attenborough. He's the sweetest man on the planet. Oh. Do you know, this is really hard to write on. Well, you'd have to write that. I was just chatting. OK. And, finally, Nigel Farage has had quite the decade... JOE: He's so fit. ..culminating in... OK. Nigel Farage has had quite the decade, culminating in the Leave campaign winning the Brexit referendum in 2016. But, back in 2015, Farage's former senior adviser revealed they had Faragisms and used the initials PFL to describe something he'd like to do once a week. CLAUDIA: Urgh. What did it stand for? PFL? I think it might be this... If that's it, I'm going to do a roly-poly. If that's it, you're going to do a roly-poly? Well, sometimes I don't know how else to celebrate. I mean, I'm very much looking forward to the roly-poly section of the show. OK. You ready for some answers? Yes! NISH: Yes. Oh, look at that. I mean, that's lovely. From Grinder and Mincer, there. I keep forgetting it! Grinder and Mincer, over there. OK, time for some answers. First up, I asked you what news story from 2015 was this BBC news reporter gallantly trying to recreate by climbing through a hole? What did you all put? Well, first of all, we thought maybe it was something to do with Shades Of Grey. Or cheese. O-Or cheese? Yeah. Stacey was big on the cheese answer. It really looked like a big stone cheese, didn't it? So I thought... Stone cheese? It did. But, no, we think we know the answer. He was demonstrating how the Hatton Garden robbers got in through the holes they drilled into the safe deposit box area. That is absolutely the right answer. Thank you. Claudia and Nish, you got this? Rock cheese is good, though. You've written Hatton Garden centre heist, but what have you written above it? We've written, "Jimmy looks so fit." And if you want to give us a point for that, that's up to you. Extra point for them. It was, of course, the Hatton Garden heist. Six men burgled the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company and reportedly took £200 million worth of jewellery. The thieves were nicknamed Mr Ginger, Mr Strong, Mr Montana, The Gent, The Tall Man and The Old Man. I think "The Old Man" is a bit confusing in that group. They all look like very old men. The one in the middle at the top looks like his neck has got legs. OK. Next, I asked you what led to a surge in sales of meat grinders and mincers in 2013? What did you put? Alan, Joe? The horsemeat scandal. NISH: Horsemeat scandal! It was a scandal. Yes! That horsemeat! Oh, about horses and their meat. Nish, Claudia? Horsemeat scandal, James. And what did you get, Jonathan, Stacey? Well, first of all, Stacey, just wrote horses. And then I drew a horse! Of a two headed horse. Now, that is a scandal. Yeah, but then we put horse's meat as well. It was in lazonya, wasn't it? "Lazonya?" "Lazonya?" Oh, grandad! So, it's not only people's names, it's actually food that you can't say. Wait, hold on. It's lazonya. It's lazonya? Are you not backing down on this? You're going with lazonya? It's lazonya! It is lazonya. It doesn't matter because it wasn't in lasagne. It wasn't in lasagne. It was in spaghetti bolohonois. The horsemeat scandal was pretty serious. There was horsemeat in our food. But the guy from Iceland absolutely nailed the PR. Here's an interview he did. Constantly testing, checking, every week. Did we test for horse? No. But we haven't tested for dog or cat either. "Oh, and there might be dog and cat." You can't test for everything. He's not wrong. So, you saw the children of Mitchell Brook Primary School, and I asked you why Johnny's wife did not come to meet him when he got out of that mine. What do you think? Well, we were thinking, "Is he having an affair?" Yeah. We thought maybe that it was revealed as an affair, although you thought maybe she went to the wrong mine as well. Yeah. ALAN LAUGHS But you don't tell the lovely people that, do you, Joe? But I remember watching this, yeah? And, did you watch as well? It was quite boring because they were down there for ages, weren't they? And I was wonder whether they could have put, like, a little Love Island spin on it and, like, halfway through, sent a fit miner in... STACEY LAUGHS ..to spice it up a bit, you know? Well, it's a very good idea. And the next time we have a mining disaster we'll definitely get you involved. Thank you. Claudia, what did you put for this? Well, I didn't know. I thought it was that she'd been having an affair. Like, I seem to remember there was a story where a wife and a mistress turned up and met each other. And that's how they discovered it. Is that what it is? I think so. And then, basically, he was scuppered because he sent his washing up. They sent their washing up to be done by their wives... That's it. ..and then his wife went, "I'm not doing your washing "and I'm not giving it to your mistress to do." So we had to beg the other miners to borrow clothes. So, while they were trapped in there, they were getting their cleaning done? Yeah. That were sending the washing? Why didn't they just go out the fucking hole the washing was going out? Why didn't they do that? The hole was only five inches wide. Oh, that'll do it. Now, what did you put for this, Stacey? Oh, well, we went with, "We're tired of his lies." Well, we're not. The wife was. We thought maybe she thought he was making excuses. "Oh, 39 days in the mine." Bullshit. That doesn't excuse. Or she was probably busy. Just a busy mum? If Joe said, "I'm trapped down a mine. "Will you come and meet me when I get out?" I'd say, "No, don't be ridiculous. I'll see you at home." Yeah. You don't pick them up from the airport, right, after a couple of years? Exactly. "Yeah, I'm landing at 5am." "OK." Good luck to you. "Don't wake me up when you come in." No. "And bring me a Toblerone, you dick." No points, points, points. OK, I asked you what natural phenomenon disrupted plans for everyone, including Miley Cyrus, John Cleese and David Attenborough? Yes. We, yes. Is it the volcano? The Icelandic volcano? I'm going to need the name of the volcano. Oh, no, you're not! It's that really long one! Don't be silly. Tell you what, if you can pronounce it, you get a point. I'll put it up on the screen. Just pronounce it and you got point. There it is. Just pronounce it. It's very easy. Is it, "Lasagne"? How do you think it should be pronounced, Jonathan? Ay-af-aya-yo-kul. Let's hear it. SPEAKER: Eyjafjallajokull. Yes! That was so... I mean, come on! He got it, he got it. Bonus point for Jonathan! That's amazing. I was travelling. He's got to get a bonus point for that. It was remarkable. Lastly, I asked you what the Faragism PFL stood for. I'm going to go straight to Nish on this cos you're a big fan of him. I have a suspicion it was Pint For Lunch. Er, you're very close with that, but you're not right. Alan, Joe? Peperami-Faced Lunatic? And you've gone for, Stacey? Well, I think I remember reading somewhere that his team said that he went out and he said you have to have a Proper Fucking Lunch, is what he said. That is exactly the right answer, which he described as being three or four bottles of wine, once a week. A Proper Fucking Lunch. Oh, my God. You would think though, with that much wine at lunch, that maybe it would affect your decision-making abilities? So, the end of the first round, let's take a look at the scores. Jonathan and Stacey have five, Claudia and Nish have four, Alan and Joe have four. OK. Join us after the break where, just like a Tinder date, we'll be promising you a good time, but it'll all end up getting a bit drunken and weird. See you then. Yeah. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Welcome back to The Big Fat Quiz Of The Decade. Our next round is all about music. Ed Sheeran has sold more than 150 million records in the last decade. He's very much the breadsticks of music. The lemon and herb Nando's chicken of music, the missionary with the lights off of music. Basically, what I'm saying is, I bloody love Ed Sheeran. LAUGHTER In 2016, Beyonce released her critically acclaimed album Lemonade. The songs on Lemonade were about feminism and female empowerment. And I, for one, think it's the best album ever made by Jay-Z's wife. LAUGHTER Time for some more questions. OK. First up, it's over to supermodel Jourdan Dunn. Hey, Jimmy. As a model, I've worn hundreds of designer outfits on the runway over the years. Louis Vuitton, Valentino, Prada, to name a few, which is why I was intrigued to hear that an Armani cape made headlines after the 2015 BRIT Awards. But can your teams remember why? Did she say cake? No. I think she said cape. Then I know. Yeah. An Armani cape? Yeah, An Armani... An Armani cape, but you thought it might have been cake. Claudia, go with that. LAUGHTER Next, I want to know what iconic item from 2010 has been specially preserved by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a form of jerky. What? LAUGHTER When you say they preserved it as jerky, was it not jerky before? No. What the hell was it then? LAUGHTER Well, what's jerky made out of? Er... CLAUDIA SHOUTS: Oh, yes! Deal with it! Sometimes I think Claudia would not be best advised to play poker. LAUGHTER Silento released Watch Me in 2015. It was a huge hit, 1.6 billion views on YouTube. It featured a number of dance moves he wanted the audience to watch him do. Can you name three of them? Yes, I can. Wh-what? LAUGHTER Jimmy, if we get these right, would you demonstrate the dances for us? 100%. I thought you'd never ask. LAUGHTER Is there a scene with this? No, they're all random. The whole quiz, yes, it's questions from the decade. No, I... LAUGHTER APPLAUSE And next it's over to Channel 4 newsroom, and the one and only Jon Snow. He's reporting on one of the biggest songs of the decade. Can you guess which one? Take it away, Jon. An incident of anti-social behaviour has been reported after a group of revellers insisted upon staying up all night to honour what they're calling the Legend of the Phoenix. Those reporting the disturbance claimed that the ringleaders wore helmets to cover their identities and that the entire group had been seen to raise their cups to the stars, citing the force of love as their beginning. An official statement from the group explained that they were doing this for good fun with some partaking in order to "get some." They all insisted they have come too far to give up who they are. However, it has been reported that some of the group are displaying signs of disorientation, with one questioning, "What keeps the planet spinning? Ah-ah." LAUGHTER More updates as we get them. Back to you, Jimmy. APPLAUSE Lastly, I want to know what track was described by Boris Johnson as "the greatest cultural masterpiece of 2012," by NME as "hideously catchy," and went on to become the first YouTube video to ever hit a billion views. Ooh. Oh, you do know that. OK. Let's get some answers. Jourdan Dunn asked you why an Armani cape made the headlines following the 2015 BRIT Awards. Claudia Winkleman. Because, er, Madonna, it was tied too tight and she fell off the stage and it was... Stacked it. It was awful, weren't it? Because she's the queen. LAUGHTER What did you get, Alan? It killed Madonna. LAUGHTER I felt sorry, because she was like a really depressed Scottish widow, looking like she was trying to end it all. LAUGHTER Jonathan, Stacey, did you get this? We, we got... Yes. ..Midenna. We, I mean, are you going to give it to us? Mi-Midenna? Midenna! LAUGHTER No! You're like that policeman in 'Allo 'Allo. "Good moaning." LAUGHTER Is "Mad-donna" the same lady? Ma-Ma...Mad-donna...fell over her cape. Mad Donna, Mad Donna from...up the estate? Mad Donna from... Oh! LAUGHTER No. Mado-Madonna. Mado-Madonna. Like lasagne - Madonna. LAUGHTER OK, points all round on that. All right. Next, I asked you what iconic item from 2010 was preserved by the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as jerky. What have you all put? Winkleman immediately in with this answer. I was excited. Well, let's go to Alan and Joe first. Cliff's dick. Cliff - Cliff Richard's dick. LAUGHTER Cliff Richard's dick is the correct answer, yes. Yes, Cliff Richard's dick. He wasn't using it, so they preserved it in the Rock & Roll... Well, no, obviously not! LAUGHTER We haven't seen it since 2010, have we, Joe? LAUGHTER It's not the most absurd thing, because someone's got Napoleon's dick. Yeah. I mean, that was being preserved. Also, crucially... ..Napoleon is dead. Well... LAUGHTER But, Cliff hasn't had a hit for a while, has he? LAUGHTER When you say someone's got Napoleon's dick, is that real? Yeah, yeah, someone's got it. Someone's got Napoleon's dick, yeah. When you say "someone," then, have you got Napoleon's dick? LAUGHTER Because I know you've got some weird stuff in your house. I do have an extensive collection of historical genitalia. LAUGHTER Well, your own, for a start! LAUGHTER APPLAUSE Claudia, Nish, what did you put? We knew it. Lady Gaga's meat dress. Winkleman was straight in with it. Yeah, that's what it was made from. Did you get this, Stacey, Jonathan? Yeah. He took a little convincing. If you make jerk something, then it goes in like a vacuum pack or in a jar, and I just don't understand how they got it so small. Shall we have a look? We can have a look. Have a look. Yeah, I'd love to have a look. Have a look. Here you go. You got it right. There it is. Oh. So, you just hang it in... LAUGHTER ..on this woman. You seem very disappointed. Well, yeah. I thought they'd package it so people could buy it. LAUGHTER OK, so, points, points, no points. I asked you to name three dance moves mentioned in the Watch Me video. Did you get these? Can we get a point for each answer we mentioned? Well, I mean, if you can do them all, I will give you points. So give me the...what's the first one? So, I've got Nae Nae. Show me the Nae Nae. What's the Nae Nae? I think, is it this? It's like you're riding a horse, isn't it? No? It's more that kind of move. That's the one. I'll show you the Nae Nae. It is him doing the Nae Nae, but I think I've nailed it more. # Now watch me nae nae # # OK! # What's the next one you got? Then we got Bop. The Bop. I think the Bop is down. Let's have a look at the Bop. Oh, right. I mean, that's... I love that one. That's...squash those... Don't forget this. LAUGHTER You need to do that. That's... You have to bop the hands too. Ooh. LAUGHTER I'm not happy with that. That's tough on the junk. Er... LAUGHTER Er, what's the next one? Whip. LAUGHTER Am I going to be on Strictly, Claudia? Am I doing all right? Yes. Yeah, you are... ..for a week or two. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE How dare you? So, what's the next one? Superman. Fine, OK. Next one? God, you've got all of these! I think this is what it's called. Skanky Leg. LAUGHTER It's...I believe you're referring to Stanky Leg. Oh. LAUGHTER Er, you may have...you may have skanky legs. LAUGHTER But the Stanky Leg is that, isn't it? Oh. It's that one. I think I'd rather have skanky legs than stanky legs. LAUGHTER Stanky legs, and then what was the last one? Erm, and then we ran out. So... So, I chipped in with - I think I know my modern dance - so I put the Hokey Cokey. LAUGHTER It's what we put! Oh... You missed the Duff and the Break Your Leg, Oh! But you did amazingly. Didn't she do amazingly, ladies and gentlemen? Yes, you did. APPLAUSE So, three points. What did you get, Claudia and Nish? You get these? Nae Nae and Whip, then I just took over and wrote Push and then I wrote the Jimmy Carr. For an extra point. Yeah. That's just where you go... HE IMITATES JIMMY'S LAUGH: Oh-ho-ho-ho! LAUGHTER Two points. You get three points. Well, hold on a second. Yes. I said I'd give you a point for each if you got them all, but you didn't get them all. But then you changed the rules to a point for each. They just got two. Yeah. We should have got five. We got five. Stacey got five. If we're doing it that way. No? You were going to get a bonus point if you got them all. So, you're saying a point for each up to three. Past that, you just get one point for all of them. That's not fair! It's unjust. I feel like I've been done out of so many points! Probably the only question in this quiz that I might know, Jimmy, and you're taking them all away from me. LAUGHTER Five points for Jonathan and Stacey! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Alan, Joe, what did you get? Er, Nae Nae, Whip and Hokey Cokey. Hokey Cokey. We couldn't think. I'd never even heard of this bloody song. LAUGHTER I haven't, I haven't. OK. Jon Snow had special news about one of the biggest songs of the decade. What did you think it was? Did you all get this? Those silly old punks, Daft Punk. And... Get Lucky. OK, so you got the artist, you got the song. You got... Daft Punk's Get Lucky. OK. And Alan and Joe probably got it? I said Chemsex Party by Little Mix. LAUGHTER Well, let's go across to Jon Snow for the answer. # She's up all night till the sun # I'm up all night to get some # She's up all night for good fun # I'm up all night to get lucky # We're up all night till the sun # We're up all night to get some # We're up all night for good fun # We're up all night to get lucky # We're up all night to get lucky # We're up all night to get lucky # We're up all night to get lucky. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Jon Snow. That's very good. I asked if you knew what song was the first YouTube video to get one billion views, described by Boris Johnson as "the greatest cultural masterpiece of 2012." What do you all put? Gangnam. Gangnam Style. Gangnam. Oh, Gangnam. Gangnam Stylie. Gangnam. Gangnam. Gangnam. Gangnam. So, it's not gangam, like gingham. Let's listen to it. Let's everybody dance. Let's go and get a burger. Gingham style is a good style though. Shall we do it? Shall we do it? Well, here we go. MUSIC: Gangnam Style by Psy CHEERING AUDIENCE CLAPS TO RHYTHM CHEERING AND APPLAUSE That was amazing! That was Gangnam Style by Psy. OK. Time now for our first bonus rounds... PANELLISTS: Ooh! This is the part of the show where I introduce some mystery guests. Oh. Ooh. All you have to do is guess who they are and you can only ask them yes or no questions. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our mystery guests. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hey. Hello. How are you? Lovely to see you. How are you? Good. Very nice to have you here. OK, so, just yes or no questions. Oh! They've all had a hell of a decade for the same reason. Do you live together? No. No. Is that your dog? No. No. Is that your dog? No. Have you brought the dog because you are dog-sitting, or is the dog an important part of the story? Sorry, you thought they were on the show but they were dog-sitting? LAUGHTER Tell you what, I just thought I'd better bring this with us, because I said I'd take care of it - our neighbours are away on holiday. No! She might have been having a walk and come through the wrong door! LAUGHTER Would you like us to stop the quiz until we can find the owner of the dog... LAUGHTER ..that you clearly rescued on the way? Can I ask the young man - have you been watching the rest of the programme? No. That is a great relief. Yeah. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE We were a bit rude earlier. We were quite sweary. Was the story all over the world or was it just in, er, Great Britain? Er... Just in Great Britain. Yeah. They all did exactly the same thing. They're all equally relevant. Did you work together in something quite special that people look forward to? Yes. Yes and no. Yes and no. We didn't work together. They didn't work together. But you were in the same thing. They were in the same thing, but they didn't work together and it is something people look forward to. Were you in the same thing at the same time, just not in the same scenes in the same thing at the same time? Oh, yes, is it a show? Were you in a show? No. No. Does the dog ice skate? Where did you get your top from? It's really nice. LAUGHTER Is it something to do with Christmas? Yes. Oh! Oh! Oh, I know it, I know it! OK, write it down. Write down your answers. OK. We think we've got it. We think we've got it. What have you got? We think that you were in a John Lewis Christmas advert a few years ago. OK. Claudia, Nish, what have you got? We think they were all in John Lewis Xmas ads and we've drawn a little Christmas tree. For an extra point. OK. And Alan, Joe? We've written "John Lewis Christmas advert" and we've not drawn a Christmas tree for an extra point. LAUGHTER OK, well, tell us who you are and why you've had a brilliant decade. My name's Esme and this is Biff the Boxer. And my name's Ethan. And we were all, erm, appeared in John Lewis Christmas ads over the past decade. Oh! APPLAUSE We can take a look. We can take a quick look. That's Esme there, in 2011's advert, where she gets a present from her son Ethan in 2017 with Moz the Monster. Aw, Biff! Biff, there you are, Biff, playing Buster, who jumped on a trampoline in 2016. They're great. APPLAUSE Absolutely adorable. Thanks very much for coming on. Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. OK, let's see what that did to the scores. OK, so, er, Alan and Joe are lucky to have 9. Claudia and Nish have 11. Jonathan and Stacey in the lead with 15. Yes! APPLAUSE We're going to take a quick break. One more time, give it up for Esme, Ethan and Biff. Thank you very much. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Welcome back to The Big Fat Quiz Of The Decade. Our next round is all about film and TV. In 2016, Netflix released Stranger Things. To be honest, the strangest thing about it was they found Winona Ryder. Frozen was released in 2013 and featured Elsa, the unstoppable ice queen who could freeze the very air around her. Her only enemy - the patio heater. OK, first it's Scarlett Moffatt. Hey, Jimmy, I love watching telly, and, this decade, we've seen some amazing characters. But can your teams tell me which world-famous hero started the decade by becoming a strong-jawed young man from Northampton, then changed into a wiry Glaswegian before ending up as a determined Yorkshire woman. Oh, it's a very good question. I can hear from Jonathan the sound of a fellow absolute nerd. Yeah. OK. Take a look at this picture of Ryan Gosling at the 2017 Oscar. Oh, yes, please. What had just happened...? I sure will. What had just happened to leave him looking so embarrassed? Channel 4's Gogglebox was one of the biggest hits of the decade. Here are some of the regulars watching a memorable bit of telly from 2016. All I want to know is, what are they watching? Well, why don't they just lay their bloody eggs near the sea? Oh, Christ. Oh! Oh, no. Oh! Oh, it's gone! Oh, my word! Go, go, go! Oh, it kicked him in the... Flipping heck, he's had encounter after encounter! Whoa, that was close! So, what are they watching? Is now the right time to ask for a blanket? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Perfect time. Cool. You would like a blanket? I'm a bit... Are you cold? Do you know what, Claudia? We... No! How have you got a blanket on you? Can I just say, because you know how long the show is. We were going to slowly age. We thought it would be funny, so me and Joe got all things to age. And then, seeing Jonathan now, how elderly he is... ..we've sort of chickened out because we feel like we're mocking him. We've got a hearing aid. We've got a hearing aid. Do you need...? We didn't want to be cruel. Can you lend Claudia the blanket? Because... Do you want the blanket? Seriously? Do you want it? No, no, it's fine. Are you sure? I've wet myself. I'm really warm. Where are these blankets coming from? What is happening? They brought some blankets with them. I've got a cloth cap, do you want that? Absolutely. OK. Let's get back to the questions. We can't play dress-up halfway through the show. He wears them all the time. I was a bit chilly. I didn't know if it was the right time. Turns out it was. I feel like I'm in Oliver. If people are just tuning in, I've lost control. And you lost the vote! OK. You are dressed so appropriately for the following question. Back in 2015, over one million people signed a petition that was delivered to the BBC in a tank. Supporters of the petition had written comments such as... An arrogant ape who does not know... JOE: Oh. What was the petition for? I'm next to a poof?! And I think it's catching. OK. Lastly, Game Of Thrones was the TV show of the decade. The series was famous for killing off high profile characters with many dying in brutal and creative ways. What I want you to do is tell me how these characters died. OK, so, Tywin Lannister... ..Ramsay Bolton... ..Lord Varys... ..Prince Oberyn. I think it might have something to do with boobs. Something to do with boobs? Breasts. Yes, they all died from breasts. So, Scarlett Moffatt asked you if you knew what hero started the decade by becoming a strong-jawed man from Northampton, then was a wiry Glaswegian before ending up as a determined Yorkshire woman. What did you think? Claudia, Nish? The Doctor from the programme Doctor Who? But the character is called The Doctor. What's that? Yes, I was an old virgin. Jonathan, Stacey? We also put "Dr Who," the show. And then, afterwards, The Doctor. Yes, mate! Can I clarify? I don't need to wear this hat for any questions? This is not part of the round? Well... Er, no, you could take that off any time you want. I don't know why you've got it on. Why didn't you just say, "Yes, you have to have the hat on the whole show"? I thought it was for a reason. Alan, Joe, you got it? Doctor Who? You could be the next Doctor with that look! OK, it was, of course, The Doctor from Doctor Who. Fabulous. All right. I asked you if you knew why Ryan Gosling was looking so embarrassed in 2017 at the Academy Awards. Because they announced the wrong film. La La Land was wrongly given the Oscar. Warren Beatty... Ah! Yeah, Warren Beatty said La La Land and then went, "What's this card?" to Faye Dunaway. And he was sheepish. Yeah. Can you guess which one of us... We didn't know the answer. Guess which one of us wrote our answer. What was your answer? Fit. I mean, he is fit, though. He is fit. Exactly. OK. What do you got, Alan, Joe? Yeah, they mixed up the best film. Well, I think, point, point, no point. OK, so, it was Best Picture, they thought it was La La Land, it was actually Moonlight. Next, I asked you if you knew which memorable TV moment from 2016 the cast of Gogglebox were watching. What did you all get? Africa. Claudia, Nish? Blue Planet. Because you thought it was...? Blue Planet. OK. And Alan, Joe? You wrote? Blue Planet II. Because that's the specific one. No. It was Planet Earth II. CLAUDIA: All right. Same thing. It wasn't Blue Planet, it was Planet Earth. Cos Blue Planet's under the water! Oh, it's the same thing. I think we were closest. I think we were the closest. We were probably the closest. But it was... I'm not going for who's the closest. You all got it wrong. It was the iguana versus the snake. It was the most incredible... Take a look. Oh, it kicked him in the... Flipping heck. He's had encounter after encounter! OK, well, you're all wrong. Oh. Fair enough. OK. I asked you, what was the subject of a petition signed by over a million people, delivered to the BBC in a tank? What did you put? To keep Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear. Jonathan, Stacey? We also put Jezza Clarkson. And Joe, Alan? Bring back Jeremy Clarkson. That's exactly right. OK. Lastly, I asked you how Tywin, Ramsay, Varys and Oberyn were killed off in Game of Thrones. I got all of these, I'm sure. OK. Go on. What are you got? So, first up, tell me how Tywin Lannister died? He was shot by his son on the toilet with a crossbow. That is how I want to go. Correct. Next one, you've got Ramsay Bolton. Ramsay Bolton. This little prick was eaten by dogs. Yes, he was. That is my second choice of how I'd like to go. Varys. He was burned by a dragon. Burned by a dragon. And, lastly? Oh, he had a horrible time of it. This is Prince Oberyn? Yes, he is fighting a big lad and he was being quite arrogant about the fight. And the arrogance didn't serve him well because the big lad got him on the floor and crushed his head with his hands. CLAUDIA GASPS Ooh. I mean, they're all spoilers, by the way, if you haven't seen it. Also, the other big spoiler is... ..the whole last series. We haven't actually seen it, but I think we gave it a good go. Yeah. Come on, what did you get? Number one - dragon. Yeah. Number two - big dragon. Number three - boobs. And number four - natural causes. Passed away in his sleep. I mean, it's a different series, but it still would've been good. But we've got... I think one is right. Two... Oh, he was eaten by dogs. He was eaten by dogs. But what is a dog if not a big dragon? Correct. Extra points for us. So, you get one point. You get four points. You get one point. Jonathan, Stacey? On the loo. By dog, dragon, head pop. Yes! Four points! Time now for a quick bonus round. We ask one of Britain's most distinguished actors and Tyron Lannister, Charles Dance, to read a selection of film reviews that were posted online by Internet users. All you need to do is work out what film he's talking about. Here's the first one. They should've named the movie Sex, Sex And Even More Sex. This isn't a psychological thriller, this is a long porno with a ballet theme. One star. OK. So, what movie was reviewed online like that? Quick, write it down. I'll give you the answer. Did he say it was sex and more sex? It's not a psychological thriller. He said sex, sex, sex. Not a psychological thriller. And a ballet theme? Yeah. It's not Black Swan. Let's see what you got. Claudia, what did you get? I'm nervous about it. What did you get? We put 50 Shades Of Grey. What did you just say to me, Claudia? What did you just say to me? I just said it was sex, sex, sex. There's no psychological thriller. And it's about ballet. Yeah. And then you said it can't be Black Swan because there's no sex in Black Swan. Well, not sex like there is in 50 Shades Of Grey. But there's quite a lot more ballet. Well, let's change it. Alan, Joe, let's go to you. So, what do you think the film was? Er, Strictly Come Dancing. I think it's absolutely disgusting. It is filth. Jonathan, Stacey? We went with Black Swan as well. First of all, we did get excited. We were thinking... 50 Shades or Billy Elliot. But then the ballet... Oh, Billy Elliot, sex, sex, sex. Like a porno with a ballet theme. Billy Elliot. What cut have you seen?! Well, Black Swan, you're absolutely right. Yeah, thank you. OK, back to Charles Dance for the next one. There's a bit where you'll be like, "That amount of water could never fit in there!" But then you notice you've been watching the film about a magical aquatic creature for X-amount of minutes, so you figure the film must be doing something right? And it is. And it does. Proper good, it is. Have fun. Five stars. I just said, "A very well known, in fact, Oscar-winning movie," to Stacey as a possible answer. She went, "What the hell is that?" Oh! OH! There's absolutely... It's not that! I can't believe you all know this movie. It's so beautiful. I feel very uncultured. It was my film of the year. No. It's not Strictly Come Dancing? OK. All right. Let's take a look. I mean, let's go to Alan and Joe. They've almost certainly got it. Shape Of Water, innit? Shape Of Water, Shape Of Water... We got Shape Of Water. Well, I think it should have been called Plenty More Fish In The Sea but you've got it right. Well done. Yes! OK, so, at the end of that round, let's check in on the scores. I can tell you that Claudia and Nish have 17 points. Just ahead, Alan and Joe with 18. In the lead, Jonathan and Stacey with 24! Right, time for a break. Our next round is called Adverts. See you in five. Welcome back to The Big Fat Quiz. Our next round is all about science and technology. Unbelievably, Instagram was only created in 2010, and it's been hugely successful because, without it, how could you possibly know that everyone else's life is better than yours? Trump went viral in 2017 after tweeting the word covfefe. It makes no sense, it doesn't mean anything, and it sounds incredibly stupid. And that was before it tweeted the word covfefe. They discovered the Higgs boson particle in 2012. Of course, they should have called it the G-spot because, after thinking it didn't exist for years, it was finally found by some guy smashing things together at high speed in a tunnel. Are you ready for some... Ready for some more big fat questions? Yes! First up, over the Bear Grylls! Hey, Jimmy. As you know, I love to push people out of their comfort zones. That's what we do at the Bear Grylls Adventure Park. We push people towards their limits every day. But one thrill-seeker in 2012 broke world records in a 20 million dollar stunt that millions of people tuned in to watch live. Can your teams remember what he did? Is Bear Grylls becoming a pirate? Arr! Oh, yes! Is it that? Yes. That's it. OK. What 2014 viral craze saw Mark Zuckerberg dare Bill Gates, who then challenged Elon Musk, who passed it on to Johnny Depp? He looks like David Walliams, doesn't he, the third one along? Elon Musk does. Oh, yeah! I'm going to show you Elon Musk then and now. It's amazing. So, this is Elon Musk, right, before he had money and now he's got money. Have a look. No! Wow. Wow. That is what money can do for you, people! He looks like an actual mole. Yes. He's not, like, a spy, but an actual mole. Yeah. That's what I meant. OK. I'm going to play you three sound effects associated with technology that has appeared in the UK in the last decade. All you need to do is name the product the sound is from. Here's the first one. DOUBLE BEEP Here's the second one. PERCUSSIVE HUM Here's the third one. RINGING God, that sounds like C-3PO having a wank. RINGING REPEATS OK. Take a look at this picture. Why did this man and his dog go viral in 2011... ..with some confusion over the dog's name? Oh, what was his name! It's the Beast of Bodmin. Can you just repeat the question? And, in the question, can you give me a bit of a clue? Like, mime something. I can't help you. It was a huge viral clip. It was enormous. It was everywhere. It was a man and his dog. Was he fucking the dog? Not that one. So it's not like the dog's a robot or some shit? The dog's not a robot? The dog is not a robot. That's narrowed it down. That's helpful. And, for your last question in this round, it's over to Sophia, the robot. Hi, Jimmy. 2016 was the year I was activated. Or, as you humans say, born. But it was also the year that a major online poll was launched, giving the British public the opportunity to name the UK's new £200 million polar research vessel. The ship ended up being called the RRS Sir David Attenborough. But that wasn't the name that topped the poll. Can your teams remember what it was? OK, so, the good news is I've made myself a girlfriend. I mean, it's an amazing thing. She was activated on Valentine's Day, 2016 and has over 50 facial expressions. That's three more than you, brother. Brother? It's the brother that got me, Nish. The brother. '70s hipster talk. This cat's a jive talker. I don't know the answer to question four and I'm upset about it. # I've written a funny one. # And I'm very pleased with it. We'll be fine. # The coffee's kicked in. # In ten minutes I'll need a shit. # What a beautiful... Lullaby. Sadly, too late for Christmas number one. I think it'd be a Christmas number two. All right, let's have some answers. Bear Grylls wanted to know what 20 million dollar stunt broke world records in 2012. What did you all get? We've put the Red Bull freefall jump from very high up. And we think the bloke's name was Felix Baumgartner. Wow. I'm afraid you've got the name a little bit wrong. I believe the pronunciation, Alan and Joe...? "Bum garden." I didn't know... I didn't know this, and he just said, "Write down bum garden!" Alan, even if you didn't say that, it sounds like the kind of thing you'd say. Yeah. Well, yeah. But he jumped out of the sky. No, he did! It's very high up, in space. Well, that's where the lives, isn't it? And the sun was smiling. No, yeah, he jumped out the sky. He jump out of the sky. Yeah. I don't think we could ask for more information than that. Jonathan, Stacey, did you get this? We also put skydive from space, but we didn't kowtow to the promotional side of things by putting Red Bull in. I don't know what kind of sweet deal you're on there, Nish. Yeah. It was Felix Baumgartner free falling from the edge of space. Next, I wanted to know what viral craze saw Mark Zuckerberg dare Bill Gates, who then challenged Elon Musk, who challenged Johnny Depp? What did you all get? Ice bucket... Yeah. ..challenge. Ice bucket challenge. Ice bucket challenge. Ice bucket challenge. You're absolutely right. Why don't we take a look at one beloved TV personality, host of The Apprentice, doing the ice bucket challenge? Everybody's going crazy over this thing. I guess they want to see whether or not it's my real hair, which it is. I'm challenging President Obama... ..my son Donald... ..my son Eric. Let's go, ladies. Woo! What a mess! I love the fact that he only listed the names of his children that he can remember. Yeah. Hang on, Barack Obama was his son? I played you three sound effects. Ah, yes. Oh, yeah. Did you get them? So, the first one was... Siri. Siri. Siri. Siri. Correct. The second one... Erotic. Windows! Netflix! Windows? You what, Stacey? Netflix. Stacey? What did you think it was? Wind... Windows. You thought that was Windows 95? You backed me up when I said that! You thought this was Quiz Of The Decade and we were doing Windows 95? I did think you were right. You did. I said, "What, windows?" And you said, "That's the one! Write it down." But, you know what? That's my fault. If anything, I'm an enabler. OK. And the last one...? Pager. Is that your pager, Stacey? FaceTime. So, you think FaceTime. OK. Did you get FaceTime? Yeah, FaceTime. You got FaceTime? We also got FaceTime. It wasn't Windows. OK, so, you got three points, Alan and Joe. Yes! Yes! Claudia, Nish? Three. Or four, just for being chatty. Yeah. OK. You got it. And then, Jonathan and Stacey? You get two points and a lifetime of shame. Windows 95. To be fair, it wasn't Stacey's fault because I led her in that direction. When I first saw it I said, "That's Microsoft Word." I asked you, why did this man and his dog go viral? Nish? He was a robot and the dog fucked him. No. And no. Jonathan, Stacey? Well, I remember the film because the dog ran off and it was, like, chasing deer or something in the park. It was running around and the man kept shouting the dog's name. Which was? Well, we weren't 100% sure. I thought it was Alan, for some reason. Because, do you remember...? Who's got a dog called Alan? Do you remember, at one time, everyone was shouting Alan. That was just on the way to the studio. Yeah, I must admit, I didn't... "Alan, come back here, you haven't paid!" OK. Joe, Alan, can we have this delivered in the style of...? TOGETHER: Three, two, one... FENTON! Perfect. Let's have a look. FENTON! FENTON! Oh, Jesus Christ. FENTON! Oh, Jesus Christ! FENTON! JIMMY LAUGHS OK, so, points, points, no points. Lastly, Sophia the robot wanted to know what topped the poll when the public were asked to name a 200 million dollar polar research vessel back in 2016. What did you think? TOGETHER: Boaty McBoatface. You all got it. ALAN: Yeah. Time now for a say-what-you-see bonus round. Have a look at these pictures and tell me what story you think they're spelling out. Who's that? Yep, Kings. Who's that? I've got no idea. Jimmy, who'd that in the third picture along? Er, I can tell you that is Liam Neeson. Ah! THEY CONFER It's a good one, isn't it? If you get it, it's very satisfying. Have you got it? Sort of got it. There's one thing I can't work. Oh, you're so clever, Nish! We think it's "Date-Ah Taken... JOE: Oh, no, I'm trying to... "..Buy Cambridge An-Al-IT-Tick-Car." That's the right answer. Oh. Yes! That was you! So good. What did you get? Alan, Joe? "Data Taken Exchange Analytica." Exchange? Buy! Of course it was buy. I thought euros, I thought euro exchange. I went to the store to exchange. Well, why did you use bloody euros? Yes, Jimmy. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with the pound? Alan, you've already got glasses on! I've given myself a migraine! Jonathan, Stacey, what did you get? Well, we got data taken, we knew it was Cambridge and we worked out analytica. I tell you what I'm going to do, then. Claudia, Nish, you got a point. And you don't and you don't. ALAN: No! Fuck off. OK, let's see what that's done to the scores. I can tell you that in last place, currently, Claudia and Nish have 24 points. Alan and Joe have 25. Jonathan and Stacy in the lead with 30. Join us after the break for more of the quiz that's big, fat and about the last decade. The clue's in the name, really. See you then. Welcome back to The Big Fat Quiz Of The Decade. This next round is all about sport. FIFA, football's world governing body, was engulfed in claims of widespread corruption in 2015. Who'd have thought FIFA would have been corrupt? Everyone. Everyone thought that. Hopefully, FIFA can put the scandal behind them and get back to doing what they do best - pretending to care about racism. What? Fuck those guys. What, are you guys sticking up for FIFA? "No! Leave FIFA alone!" In 2016, the Olympics were held in Brazil. The pool turned green but organisers insisted it was safe. Not to drink, of course. Or to swim in. Or to breathe near. But absolutely safe. Jeez, it looked like the Hulk pissed in it. London hosted the Olympics in 2012. Some people thought the London Olympics were a waste of British time, money and resources. And then, along came Brexit! OK. Time for some more questions. First up, it's over to footballing legend Peter Crouch. Hi there, Jimmy. I'm a big fan of Twitter. I love it when my tweets get shared. But, back in 2014, a tweet from cricketing legend Ian Botham went viral when he probably didn't want it to. #MiddleStump started trending and Ian said his account had been hacked. But can you remember why? Why's he got Rob Beckett's teeth in? Next up, I want to know what 77-year-old sporting drought was ended in southwest London in July, 2013? What?! It can't just be that. I need a person or a video or a song. What's in southwest London? Got you! Yeah, I mean, Nish wrote it down, is what you got. Yeah. Well done. OK. Take a look at this clip. All I want to know is what this man is talking about. So, I would make an agreement with the spectators. Let's blow it, but don't blow it all match because then, you know, everybody is sort of happy, and so definitely don't ban it. It's part of South African football culture. Leave it that way. But let's not blow it 90 minutes at a time. Yes! Has it got to be, like, sports? About blowing? It's got to be something sport-wise? Yeah, ideally. This is the sports round, yeah. No, because it sounded a bit like, you know, a McDonald's hot apple pie and you have to blow it? You are so right. Yeah. You know! It's one of my favourite things, but it's dangerous. It's molten lava inside. Here's Gary Lineker in his pants on television back in 2016. All I want to know is, why? I can give you a clue. It is not because one of my sex dreams came true. Man, Lineker is keeping it tight! But that's why he's doing it, because he wants to show off. That wasn't the reason! It wasn't the reason he gave, but we all know the real reason. He's thinking, "I'm in pretty good shape for man in my mid-50s. "Have a look at this, ladies." Well, I eat a load of crisps and I don't look like that. OK, finally in this round, have a listen to this audio clip of a tense, no-nonsense interview. All I want to know is, who it is and what they're confessing to. Was it a big deal to you? Did it feel wrong. At the time? No. It did not even feel wrong? No. Scary. Did you feel bad about it? No. Even scarier. Oh. Yes! OK, now, are ready for some answers? Yes. Yeah. OK. Peter Crouch asked you what embarrassing incident in 2014 led to cricketing legend Ian Botham claiming his Twitter had been hacked... Yeah, sure, sure. ..and saw the hashtag "middle stump" go viral. What did you all get? I know this very specifically. I put it was a picture of his penis, in inverted commas, because he claimed it wasn't his penis, but it was... The problem is, you looked at it and went, "That's Ian Botham's penis." Like, it looked beefy. And this was the picture. CLAUDIA: I've got a lot of questions. Question away. What would you like to know? Question one - why would you send that particular photo? Two - why the four dots and two kisses? Where's the question mark? So, your problem is the grammar? NISH: Yeah. I've got a problem with the grammar. But, also, it's just such a repulsive position. Like, I'm not saying... I mean, the penis looks fine. It's not flattering. It's not flattering. It looks like a space hopper with a slow puncture. OK, so, Jonathan, Stacey? We knew it was a dick pic but we put "Middle Stump Penis." Alan, Joe, you got "Picture of his penis." Yeah, great. Good points all around. I asked you what 77-year-old sporting drought was brought to an end in Southwest London, 2013. What do you will get? Claudia, Nish? A British man won Wimbledon. Alan, Joe? We just put Wimbledon, but we didn't know what was going on down there. You just thought some fun on the Common? Yeah, we didn't know. We don't know. We're not into sport. We don't follow cricket. OK. Jonathan? We put Andy Murray win Wimbledon, ending the drought of a male British player winning Wimbledon. Of course, Virginia Wade won in '77. I showed you a clip of a Dutchman talking about blowing something. What was he talking about? V-V-V-Vuvuzelas. Vuvuzelas at the World Cup. Oh! We were close. Jonathan said, "Uvoovoo." Uvoovoo? I just went with it. What have you written afterwards? Well, then I thought, "I'm going to try and put something in it possibly could be." What is it? So I said, "Whistle trumpet." Yeah. Lovely. The whistle trumpet? The famous South African whistle trumpet, the uvoovoo. "What are you doing this evening?" "Whistle trumpet." "He's a very lucky boy." But it was like... It is a whistle trumpet! Yes, it's a whistle trumpet. I'm a dab hand at the whistle trumpet. And Stacey dad's in the audience, you'll be pleased to hear. That wasn't a rude joke, Jimmy. Are you sure? It wasn't. I think it was. Dad, it wasn't. OK. I think points all around. You all got kind of vuvuzela, or whatever that spelling is. Uvoovoo. OK. I asked you why Gary Lineker presented Match Of The Day in his pants. What did you all think? Midlife crisis. Come on, he said he'd do it if Leicester won... The Premier League. And he said he'd do it on Match Of The Day. Cos it was such an implausible thing to happen. Because Leicester have historically not been very good at football. And then, on that particular year, Jimmy, they played ever so well and they won the league. And, so, he had to present the show in his pants. Joe, Joe, you've been hacked! It would appear. Yeah. OK, points all round. And, lastly, I played you an audio clip from an interview. Did you know who was talking and what they were confessing to? OK, so, you got Lance Armstrong. Claudia and Nish? You got it? Yes. Lance Armstrong, using performance enhancing drugs. OK. And Alan, Joe? Yeah. Lance Armstrong, yeah. I mean, it's properly terse and compelling, this exchange. Take a look. Was it a big deal to you? Did it feel wrong? At the time? No. It did not even feel wrong? No. Scary. Did you feel bad about it? No. Even scarier. CLAUDIA: Ooh! Well, that's killed the mood, hasn't it? OK, time for another bonus round. And I'm incredibly excited to be joined by one of the stars of the biggest mobile game of the decade, Pikachu from Pokemon. Please welcome our special guest! # Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all. # Hey, Pikachu. High five, Pikachu. Yay! Go and say hello to everyone. Go and say hello. JOE: Catch it! Catch it! Hello. Oh, you're adorable. Don't fall over. Oh, hi! Hello. Hi. Thank you, Pikachu. Hey, Pikachu. My children are going to be so jealous. So nice to meet you. Aw. OK, Joe. Pikachu? Pikachu? He's actually quite... Have you got a question? Pikachu doesn't say much so I've got the question round your neck. Is it Sandi Toksvig in there? Sandi Toksvig, she's allergic to shellfish, it turns out. Very good. OK, Pikachu's got a question for you. Yeah, all right, Pikachu, have a little dance around. Pika, pika! Oh, lovely Pikachu! OK, Pikachu wants you to name a number of his friends. So, here's three of his friends. Just name them, couldn't be easier. I've got so many. We've got to name these ones? Just those three. Just those three, because Pikachu is one of them. Pikachu, start dancing, baby. # Gotta catch 'em all It's you and me # I know it's my destiny. # Pikachu, do the Nae Nae! Do the Nae Nae! Pikachu! Do the Break Your Legs! Pikachu! Do the Skanky Leg! Come over here. Come over here and do the Skanky Legs. Oh, yeah! And now, dab. Dab a little bit. Oh! Dab! Dab, dab, dab. Oh, he's so good at dabbing. Pikachu, you nearly fell over when you dabbed, didn't you? Yes, you did! AUDIENCE SWOONS He's only hugging me because he's exhausted. OK, so, have you named these characters? Yes. Jonathan, what have you got? On the left, it's Squirtle. Then, it's Charmander before he evolves into Charizard. And then it is, of course... Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur. Who becomes Venusaur. And, Claudia, Nish, you think? We've got, number one - FENTON! Number two - Black Swan. I wanted to get it in somewhere. And, number three - Jason Bieber. I think it's Charizard, not Charmander... That's Charmander. It's definitely Charmander. It is Charmander. It evolves into Charizard. Yeah. What else you got? Bulboa. No. That's Rocky Balboa. And Mirtle. No points. No points, no points, three point! Yeah! Yay! Pikachu! So, let's have a look, see what that's done to the scores. OK, so, Claudia and Nish are on 29. Alan and Joe are on 29. In the lead, with 38, Jonathan and Stacy! Please thank my guest, Pikachu. See you after the break! Come on, Pikachu! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Welcome back to The Big Fat Quiz Of The Decade. Our next round is all about people. In 2012, TMZ leaked naked photos of Prince Harry in a hotel room in Las Vegas. Well, you know what they say. What happens in Vegas stays on the Internet forever. LAUGHTER Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow consciously uncoupled in 2014. It was all very amicable, until it came to deciding who got the CD collection. And then there was a massive row... ..when Gwyneth refused to take them. LAUGHTER Caitlyn Jenner came to prominence in 2015, right around the time Bruce Jenner mysteriously disappeared. LAUGHTER I want answers. LAUGHTER And Theresa May was Prime Minister from 2016 to 2019. I'm not sure what she's doing next. I'm guessing not Strictly. LAUGHTER BAND PLAYS LAUGHTER APPLAUSE OK, time for some more big fat questions? ALL: Yes. Yes, Jimmy. I love the quiz! LAUGHTER Take a look at this picture of Gillian Duffy from Rochdale. She made headlines during the 2010 general election campaign. All I want to know is, why? She was either... Oh, God. Thinking back, what a lovely election. One thing happened. Next, it's over to Strictly's Oti Mabuse, who has a question for you. Hi, Jimmy. There has been some amazing pairings on Strictly over the years and perhaps none as powerful as the royal couplings we have had this decade. Kate and William got married in 2011. And, of course, Harry and Meghan in 2018. Between them, they have four children. But can you name them all? This is all Winkleman. All Winkleman. This is pure Winks, as far as I can tell. The whole lot of them is just a bunch of old white people and the girl from Suits. LAUGHTER I don't know if they're white because I don't see colour, Nish, but OK. LAUGHTER OK, David Cameron was Prime Minister from 2010 to 2016. He gave us Brexit and he was the face of Pig-gate. But what did he do at this pub to make headlines in June 2012? Oh, didn't he leave his kid in the... INAUDIBLE I think he did. I think he forgot... Take a look at this clip. All I want to know is, what are these people talking about? He was so great to even go there. So great. And then he's talking about it and he's kind of, like, in that way educating girls about it, and... A very inappropriate thing to say. It was disrespectful to her memory. It proves that he doesn't just care about his concert and his fans. He likes the history of the Netherlands. Oh! Being a Belieber. No! No, no, no, Claudia, stop. You've got to just answer it. Come on, have a guess. I can't! No, no. No idea. No idea. No idea! I thought this was an easy one. I guess it's not an easy one. Jonathan says you've got this, right? We've got this. OK. We think so. Er, next one. Finally, in 2014, actor Shia LaBeouf wore a paper bag on his head to a film premiere. Oh, yeah. He had written a message on the bag. Under your desks you'll find a paper bag. I want you to write that message on the paper bag. What did he have written on his paper bag? It was on the front of it, so where the eye holes are. Yeah. What did Shia LaBeouf put on? Shia LaBeouf. It's not pronounced Shia LaBeouf. It's pronounced "lasagne", actually. LAUGHTER La-zornya. LAUGHTER OK, you're ready for some answers? Have a look at this picture of Gillian Duffy from Rochdale. She made headlines during the 2010 general election campaign. I just want to know why. She's the one where they said, "There's going to be a general election." She went, "Blimey, not another one." No. No. No. No. LAUGHTER I think that might be 2017. She was the woman that Gordon Brown called a bigoted woman. When he left his mic on... When he left his lapel mic on. Yeah. And it got picked up on the news. Oh. What do you think, Alan? We got the same. Gordon Brown said she was bigoted. Let's listen to Gordon Brown. He left the mic on. Got back in the car. And this is what he said. You should never put me with that woman. Whose idea was that? INDISTINCT REPLY Soon, I think. It's ridiculous. What did she say? Everything. She's just the sort of bigoted woman that said she used to be Labour. So he called her a bigoted woman. So everyone voted for David Cameron and things went great. LAUGHTER OK, points, points. No points. It's all right. You're still in the lead. OK. We went over to Oti from Strictly. She had a question for you. William and Kate's and Harry and Meghan's kids - all four for a point. Winkleman wrote this down at a speed that I would describe for the royal family should be concerning. OK, so they're a kidnap risk because of you, Claudia. Basically. what have you... what have you written? George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie. OK. Put them in order of preference. You've got... Alan, Joe. You've gone with... I wish I'd brought my commemorative plate because I could've read them. But we've only got George and Charlotte. But we would have written Ringo and Paul as well. George, Charlotte, Ringo, Paul. Jonathan, Stacey? We're so c... We got Charlotte, George, Louis, and then we went with Alfie instead of Archie. But does that look like Archie from there? It's not clear. Maybe we did go with Archie. It was Archie. With an "F". ARF-chie. OK. Points to Claudia and Nish. We don't get anything? No. Yes! Yes. OK. I wanted to know, what did David Cameron do in this pub in 2012 to make the headlines? What did you put? He forgot he had a child. He left his daughter in the pub. He forgot his child inside. That makes it sound like he was didn't have any joy. He forgot the child inside. He forgot he could sing and dance and play. He did forget his inner child. It's very sad. He also left his real kid in the pub. What's the etiquette that when you leave a kid? I ain't got kids. If you leave a kid in a pub... If you lose one, is it like umbrellas? If you see one that's a bit the same, you take that? OK. So he left his daughter, forgot his kid. He forgot his child inside. I showed you a clip and ask you what those people were talking about. What did you all put? I had to guess. Go. Yes. My guess was Eamonn Holmes said that the Netherlands is a shithole. LAUGHTER We just wrote Justin Bieber. And the story is... Yeah. He went to the Netherlands and he said something that was sort of inappropriate, but he didn't mean it. Yeah. Do you know what the story is? I don't wanna.... I don't want to expand. I don't like...move on! I'm going to give you no points here because it's not enough just to say Justin Bieber. The answer is - Jonathan, Stacey? He visited Anne Frank's house and he wrote in the book that he thought she would have been a Belieber. Oh, God, I forgot about that! How could you forget about that? Justin Bieber wrote this in the book. To be fair, he was about 16 then, and I don't know many 16-year-old boys who go to Amsterdam for the weekend and bother going to the Anne Frank house. Most of them are off their tits on brownies. You really are a... Jason Bieber fan. I'm a Belieber. We are fans of Jason and we don't care who knows it. I gave you paper bags. I said, what did Shia LaBeouf write on his when he went to a film premiere? To get your answers, just pop your paper bags on. OK? I wrote it the wrong way round. That's fine. OK. So, Jonathan, you've got... It feels like the Ku Klux Klan have run out of budget. With the glasses, you look remarkable. I feel like I'm in a sort of Eyes Wide Shut party. But in Croydon. Instead of fancy masks, they've just got bags over their heads. "I'm not famous any more," you've got, Jonathan. Yes, that's why I think you wrote. OK. And then, Stacey, you've written... I've written the same, just upside down, Jimmy. OK. Claudia? Same situation in this team. Yeah. Ditto. OK. Right. And then you've got... Joe? Not famous. And Alan? I'm not famous any more. You sounded very sad there. You all got that. Points all round. APPLAUSE OK. Time now for a special bonus round. I'm going to show you three memorable photos from the last decade that have all been subtly improved. All I need you to do is tell me who is in the original photo. So here's the first one. Just write this down on your screens. I mean, I look terrific. Is that Jimmy? Have you only just realised? I thought, oh, It's a handsome young woman. She's a great singer. Doesn't matter what she looks like. Exactly. It's about the voice. Yeah. You know, that's not... That's me. I know that now. OK, so next one? I don't want to give anything away, Stacey, but that's me. That's my little face and that is my boot-ocks. It's a "break the internet" photo. OK. And the last one. That's the only one where the photograph is improved by having your face in it. I don't know. Actually, you're right. Have you got three answers? Yeah, OK. What did you get? Adele, Kim Kardashian and Ed Miliband. OK. I think everyone concurs. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Absolutely right. Points all round. Let's take a look. There's Adele. Then it's Kim Kardashian. And the last one, Ed Miliband. There you go. OK, so let's see what that's done to the scores. I can tell you that Alan and Joe have 35. Just ahead, Claudia and Nish with 36. Jonathan and Stacey, 44 points. APPLAUSE Join us after the break when it'll be like Breaking Bad in here. Extenuating circumstances will have made us turn to drugs. See you then. CHEERS AND APPLAUSE Welcome back to the final part of The Big Fat Quiz of the Decade. This next round is all about the talking points and water cooler moments from the past ten years. In 2010, Boris Bikes launched in London. They're called Boris Bikes because, just like Boris, they're heavy, cumbersome and constantly heading for a car crash. Tinder launched in 2012, and apparently the most effective way to get a day on Tinder is to make someone laugh. Which is why I always send a photo of my tiny penis. Works every time. In October 2017, an unusual red sky was reported across London. You know what they say - red sky at night, shepherd's delight, red sky in the morning, global warming. It was nothing to worry about, just a natural phenomenon - like the ice caps melting, all the bees disappearing and Yorkshire being underwater. OK, time for your last set of questions. What fad from the middle of the decade was described as "wands of narcissism", "the most shameless fashion accessory ever" and caused a journalist to ask, "Was the human arm such a problem?" NISH: It's quite fun. I'll give you a clue - it's not the Fleshlight. How do we cross this out, Jimmy? LAUGHTER OK. What must-have beauty treatment from 2011 is being described here. Oh. Oh, yes, please. OK, next, it's over to McFly for a question. ALL: Hi, Jimmy! We've had a good decade. I won Strictly. I was crowned King of the Jungle. I joined The Voice kids as a coach. And I became a bestselling author. But one of the biggest books of the decade was 50 Shades of Grey. Oh, mate, I loved that. Yeah, classic. I couldn't get enough! I was going to read that line! Anyway, back to the question. Can your teams tell me by what name lead character Anastasia Steele refers to the naughty voice in her head? JONATHAN: Oh, the voice in her head. So Anastasia Steele from 50 Shades of Grey uses what name to refer to the naughty voice in her head. Why did this family's BBC News appearance end up with 32... CLAUDIA: Yes! Well, I guess I'll just go and fuck myself, shall I? I mean... I think Claudia might have it. Why did this family's BBC News appearance end up with 32 million views on YouTube and led to the father admitting it definitely wasn't staged and, yes, he was wearing pants? This is the best thing ever! Yeah, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. OK. Dating apps like Tinder have popularised terms catfishing, ghosting and benching. Catfishing - when you have a fake online profile, ghosting is when you cut off communication with someone all of a sudden. Can you tell me, what is benching? Tinder is, uh... It's Grindr for straight people. No. Too much. There shouldn't be, I know. It shouldn't be allowed. I don't approve of that. Do you know what? My problem - I just want to hear about it. No. I don't want to hear about what they're getting up to. What straight people do in their bedrooms is up to them. I just don't want to hear about it. I think it's disgusting. OK. Is everyone finished? Yeah. Yes. Right, let's get some answers. I asked you what was described as wands of narcissism and the most shameless fashion accessory ever. What did you get? Selfie stick. We said selfie stick, too. Points all round. Selfie sticks. APPLAUSE I asked you what must-have beauty treatment from 2011 was described as... What did you all think? Fishing eating pedicure. NISH: Yeah, fish pedicure. Sorry, the fish eating pedicure? Yeah. Where you eat fish? No! The fish eat you! The fish eat you. Yeah. Yes. Oh. Claudia and Nish? Fish pedicure. Fish pedicure. Alan and Joe? Fish that eat dead skin. Well, you're all absolutely right, yeah. Good. APPLAUSE The boys from McFly wanted to know what 50 Shades of Grey character called her naughty voice. We're happy with our answer. Fenton! You think Anastasia Steele's - the naughty voice in her head was... Yes! Fenton! We just learned about that video tonight and we really love it. That film would be so much better... if every time Mr Grey walked in... "Fenton!" What have you got, Stacey? Well, neither of us have read the book. Neither of us have seen the film, so we... I assumed it was the devil. You think the voice from downstairs would be... The devil. ..the devil? We thought it was the voice in her head. You said it was the voice in the head. Inner voice, yeah. So Stacey guessed devil, and I guessed Pippin. You give a name, you'd say, "Oh, Pippin's awake again!" I like that. It's the sort of name I'd give it. I'd say, "Oh, Pippin. "What do you want, Pippin? Kill again?" LAUGHTER What do you think 50 Shades of Grey is about? I haven't read it, but I assume it's a mass murderer. OK. What do you get, Alan and Joe? "It was... Rebekah Vardy." LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Did you read it, Alan? What? 50 Shades of Grey? No, I didn't! I thought the film was rubbish, and there's not many times I lose an erection in the cinema. Well, she called it her "inner goddess". Aah! No-one gives a fuck. OK. I asked you why this family's BBC News appearance got 32 million views. NISH: Yeah. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE It was absolutely amazing. It's the best clip ever. Yeah. Do you want to recreate it with a chair? Yes! If you move that. You do the chair. JONATHAN: I'll be the newscaster. I'm doing the interview on Korea and he's going... So as you'll see, the situation in Korea couldn't be far worse. Now be the mum! Be the mum! We never quite know if it's an act of aggression... Excuse me one moment. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE No. Did you even believe me...? LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Oh, my God! So good at acting! Alan, they bought it! Did you really think my teeth had come out?! Also, if you have false teeth, would you really go for those? That was a remarkable recreation, there. That was like something from Crimewatch. Let's take a look at the original clip. Oh, yes! The question is, how do democracies respond to those scandals? And what will it mean for the wider region? I think one of your children has just walked in. I mean, shifting...shifting sands in the region. Do you think relations with the North may change? Um, I would be surprised if... That, um... LAUGHTER My apologies. Most... APPLAUSE I asked you what the term "benching" - made popular by Tinder - meant. Claudia Winkleman, Nish Kumar. We've put, "You pause the relationship..." You bench them. "..to have..." You have another relationship but you don't break up with them. You just sort of pause it. They've been benched. Like on a football field. Yeah. I'm gonna bench you! The right answer. Is it?! Is it really?! Yes! APPLAUSE Well done. OK, so what did you get, Jonathan and Stacey? Essentially got the same thing. You keep him on the bench for later. Yeah, you keep someone in reserve. Alan, Joe? We've put this, but I don't know why Joe's written it like he's from the Wild West. Substi-TOOTIN'! Horseshit! A substitute. Can I give you something for substitute? Yes! Yes, you could. Keeping them on the bench for later. Substituting them for a little while? OK, points all round. Yay! APPLAUSE OK. Finally, it's time for The Big Question, Ladies and gentlemen, to ask it, please welcome Charlotte Crosby. # I came in like a wrecking ball... # CHARLOTTE SCREAMS CHEERS AND APPLAUSE Oh, I'm the wrong way! Hi, guys! It was always going to go wrong there! Do you know, when I was going to come through the wall I started to panic for a second! Hi! Hiya. Hi, Jimmy. It's like another sex dream coming true. Wow. OK. So you've got a big fat question for us. I have, I have. I'll tell you, what. It looks like you've got a massive haemorrhoid. LAUGHTER Right, guys. So, I've got a question for yous. Thank you. What was the UK's biggest film at the box office, the most watched...TV show, and the best selling album of the decade? Well, if she falls over and dies, I can tell you that this will be the most watched show. And there's ten bonus points if you get all three of these... STACEY: That looks like so much fun. ..so anyone could win. It's so relaxing. It looks really therapeutic. Feels like I'm in the womb. How big was your mum's womb? I'll give you a slight clue with the TV show. Event. Think big event. Oh! Which wins! I-I don't know, but you really have to stop taking whatever Nish has been giving you. All right. So have you all got answers? Yeah. OK. So what did you all think the biggest film was? What did you get, Jonathan? We thought...we put Frozen. Frozen! Interesting. It was big! ALAN: We got Frozen. You got Frozen. What did you go for, Claudia and Nish? NISH: Skyfall. Well, I can tell you the answer is... It is Star Wars: The Force Awakens. STACEY: Aw, you said that! JONATHAN: I guessed that as well! I'm so sorry. Skyfall is, I believe, second. CLAUDIA: Good! OK. Most watched TV moment. What did you get, Jonathan and Stacey? We put the Olympics opening ceremony. OK. What did you get, Claudia and Nish? Olympics opening ceremony. What did you got, Alan and Joe? Opening ceremony. That is correct. Yeah! Well, no, it fucking isn't. That is...that is the correct... Have a read of it. Have a read of the words. The Olympics... ..closing... LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE DROWNED OUT BY APPLAUSE Huh? It's all the same, really. It is all the same. Jimmy, to be fair, Charlotte's trying to do it sitting on a wrecking ball. You've been fucking up all night and you're standing at a table. Yeah, good point, Jonathan. APPLAUSE Everyone deserves a point! Yes. Thank you, Charlotte. Queen Charlotte! CHANTING: Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! OK, points all round for the Olympics. And then what do you think the biggest album was, of the last ten years? We thought it would be 21 by Adele. STACEY: We thought that. What did you think? We went with 21 by Adele. JOE: 21 by Adele. What's the answer? 21! Points all round! APPLAUSE OK, so, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It was the Olympics closing ceremony, and it was 21 by Adele. OK. And that means the final scores are... Alan, Joe. It's not great. You got 41 points. You did not win. You came last. You're a disgrace. Commiserations. OK, ah... Claudia and Nish, you got 42. You did very well. But the winners, Jonathan and Stacey, come and collect your trophy. CHEERS AND APPLAUSE Winners of The Big Fat Quiz of the Decade.
