Evenin', Mrs. Hope. Uh, got some mail for you. Thank you, young man. Much appreciated. A little late, don't you think? Usually the mail's here around 1:00 in the afternoon, Not 5:00. Yeah. No, I'm sorry about that. Really busy day. Understood. Tomorrow, though? 1:00? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna see through it, Mrs. Hope. 1:00. Thank you. Oh, no, no! Calm down. He's just the mailman. I'm sorry about that. He's not usually like that. It's okay, Mrs. Hope. Uh, you know, pups will be pups, huh? Yeah. You have a good evenin'. Yeah, you, too. Come on, boy. Somebody should put a muzzle on that mutt. Ah, you're here! Of course, I'm here. I'm a punctual pup. Plus, this is an important day. Oh, of course, you're here. You're always so punctual and you know how important this day is. Duh. I just said that. Okay. How do I look? Okay, two barks for classic beauty or one bark for, mm, not so much. Oh, thank you so much, my boy! Okay. Now it's your turn. What is that? You are gonna look so handsome. Uh-uh, no way. No amount of treat is going to talk me into wearing that. I look ridiculous. I think we look pretty good if I do say so myself. You definitely do. Oh, how could I forget? Oh! Ah, the pièce de résistance! Okay. Oh, you look so handsome. Hey, what am I? A Christmas tree? Remember, wait till I whistle, like we rehearsed, okay? Yeah, yeah. We've been over this 1,000 times, Mom. I'm so sorry. I know we've gone over this 1,000 times. It's just, I'm so nervous. The last time I did this, I wasn't the one proposing. It will be fine, Mom. Trust me. A little progressive action is a good thing. Oh, my boy. You're such a good boy, you're such a good boy. Mom, you're messing up my fur. We have to go see if those kids are ready. And they're staying out of trouble, okay? Shall we go? Let's go. Let's go. Those two? Don't hold your dog breath. Ow! Let me do it. Sorry, Dom, but I'm older and in charge. Well, I may be younger, but I'm gentler. Hmm. Kids, he's gonna be here in less than 10 minutes. It's time for-- Hey guys, what's happening? Inspection. It's her fault, she's in charge! It's not my fault. I mean, I'm ready. Ava. Yeah, Mom? Your skirt's on backwards. Awkward. Oh yeah. He's here already? He's never on time. Oh no! Oh no. He's early. Oh, he's never early. Why is he early? Okay, all right, Kids, you-- You guys need to finish getting ready, okay? But, Mom! What? My tie. Okay. See, it's not that hard. Yeah. See, Dominick? It's not hard. And you, flip that skirt around. Oh yeah. Houdini, can you help me? Sure thing. No problem, Kiddo. Thanks, Houdini. Aw! Thanks, boy. Looking good, Ava. Okay, you look great. Uh, if you can get the door? You know what to do. And I'll be down in a sec. Okay. I think I might actually pull this off. He's gonna say "yes". I just know it. What's up, Kiddo? Welcome to Chez Sullivan. Ah, Chez Sullivan! Cool! What's up with the French accent, Ava? No, there is no Ava here at Chez Sullivan. It is only Yvette. Ah, oui. Mademoiselle Yvette. Well, I'm sorry, because you, you know, kind of remind me of somebody else I know. Well, please do lead the way. Mademoiselle Sullivan, your date has arrived! What? - Your date has-- - What'd you say? I said, "He's here, Ma." Right this way. Hey, Mom, shouldn't you be going downstairs? Oh, what am I doing? I have a date to greet. Okay, you know what, you guys? I'll um, I'll just meet you downstairs. All right. We'll be ready and waiting. Okay. Mademoiselle Sullivan, Monsieur, enjoy your meal. Merci. Mademoiselle Sullivan. What is going on? Well, I know how much you wanna go to France and I know how difficult it is with the kids. So we thought we would bring France to you. So you're not just making fun of my silly moustache? No, I'm not actually. Have a seat, please. Great. Allow me to check on our dinner. It seem that our cordon bleu is needing five more minutes until it's fini. Magnifique. Waiters. Allow my waiters to bring you our finest French grape juice. S'il vous plaît. Hi Shane. What's up, handsome Monsieur? Thank you, Mr. Waiter, Ms. Waitress. You are dismissé. What does that mean? It means leave the room. Cheers. What do I owe this to? For you being you. And making this past year one of the happiest years I have had in a really long time. I never thought I would feel like this again. Oh, you know, I feel the same. And I don't need to tell you that you are the best thing that's ever happened to me. You okay? Yeah, actually, I'm great. Hey, Houdini! Hey! Hey Shane. How are you? Nice tux. Thanks. Mom made me wear it. Okay, Mom. I'm coming. Just like we rehearsed. Sorry about that. Sometimes I just get so excited. I know. Me, too. Shane. My love, my sweet. Wait a minute. Are you uh-- Just let me do this, okay? Please. After Matthew passed away, I never thought I'd meet someone like you. You've embraced me and my kids. You make me feel so loved and whole again. And I know you know what's coming next. And it might be unusual that I'm the one doing the asking. But will you marry me? Did he say "yes"? I don't know, but I really hope he did. Well, of course. You're my girl. Is that a yes? Oh, that's a yes. -Yay! -Yay! -We're getting married. -We're getting married. Wooh! He said "yes"! Thank dog! I told you he would. Oh, what we got here? Sorry, Kid. Grandma's card ain't gonna make it, Bill. Einstein, he said "yes"! It's a yes! He said "yes"? He said "yes". Splendid. What's that? Did I hear Shane said "yes"? Hey, Jackpot. Yeah, he did! Ew. Can you do me a favor? Hey, don't forget about me. Jackpot, can you sound the alarm? Sure. Anything for you, Houdini. I'm ready to fire. Thanks, Jackpot. Use that mighty bark. You got it. Hey everybody, we've got some good news. He said "yes"! Einstein, let's meet at the junkyard to celebrate after the owners go to sleep. I'll be over at midnight to spring you guys. Copy that. I'll be here. Just be ready to unlatch me. You know me. I can unlock anything. See you in a bit. Sounds stupendous. Oh, I'm so excited! Well, hello there. What can I get for you today? Get me the biggest bowl of chocolate pudding you got, with extra whip. It's been a good day! That's fantastic. If you need to celebrate a day, chocolate pudding is always the way. I'll get that right back to you in a jiff. Yeah, thanks, huh. You're still fillin' your gut with that whip cream, huh? Dean. What's up, old partner? What are you doin' here? You-- you're supposed to still be in jail. No, no, no. Not supposed to. I was. You're out? I'm sittin' here, ain't I? Oh, hey, that-- that's great news, man. Yeah, it is. But it's news you should have already been aware of. You were supposed to pick me up, remember? Is today the 19th? It's the 26th. The 19th was last week. Ugh. My bad, man. Yes, your bad. As was my incarceration. Your what? My time in jail, you ninny. You know, the point of a getaway driver is for that driver to wait for the crook to get back before he leaves! The good news is I got away, huh? Yeah, and I didn't. You owe me, Crusher. I kind of-- I went legit. Uh, you know, got a good job at the post office, Slingin' mail. Yeah, that's not what I saw outside. How you paying for this? That hard-earned cash you stole from the cards outside? Crusher, you're the farthest thing from legit. Fine. But I mean-- I don't know, robberies, they-- they kinda scare me, you know? I'm more like a petty criminal, you know? I like stealing candy from babies. And, you know, I-- I'm good at stealing birthday cards from kids, you know? Robbin' stores, it's uh, it's a little too risky for me. Yeah, I'm not doing stores anymore. I just got out. I'm a reformed man. You are? Thank God! Oh, does that mean we can finally start the dance studio that we always dreamed of? No, you fool. Think bigger. We're movin' on to greener pastures. You wanna rob a farm? And here I thought delivering mail would make you smarter. No. We're gonna rob homes. Like people's houses? Exactly. We wait for them to leave and then we rob 'em. But how're you gonna know if they're there or not? Crusher, when you deliver mail and nobody's home, what happens? No, they don't read the mail. And? Uh, the mailbox gets-- gets really filled and it's just hard to keep stuffing it in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when somebody's mailbox is full and it's hard to cram the mail in there-- They're not there! Huh! You-- you and I, my friend, I think we just found our new bread and butter. You just have to point us in the right direction. You wanna rob houses on my route? No, we... ...are gonna rob houses on your route. You say where to go and we get rich. Mm. We'll talk more about that dance studio. I hope so, yeah. To new beginnings. Yeah, new beginnings. Get your own. Come on. Wow. We're getting married. I know. Do you really think we're gonna be able to plan a wedding that fast? Yes, of course, we will. Between your family, and my family, and all of our friends, we are gonna have the most beautiful, magical wedding ever. I don't think I've ever been this happy. Come on, guys, it's getting late. I got a party to host. What's wrong? What's wrong? Uh, n-- nothing's wrong. Nothing is wrong. -You okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. I just thought I heard something. You did! Come on, Mom, my friends are waiting. So breakfast tomorrow at the cafe? I am gonna be there at 9:00 a.m. sharp. Perfect. 'Cause then we can, you know, give that new ring a spin. Right. Just for the record-- Yes? I was gonna ask you. You just kinda beat me to it. -You were? -Yeah. -Really? -Mm. Ew, gross. Can we just hurry this along, please? We're being watched. -Are we? -Yeah, right. Are we? Yes, by a peeping Houdini. I-- Hmm. Yeah. Well, Houdini, yeah. He's a curious one. Yes, he is. Well, watch this, Houdini. Have it your way, guys. This pup can't wait any longer. Houdini, are we ready? Born ready. Wait a minute. Just makin' sure I have everything. Okay, let's go. Freedom. Sweet freedom. Nothing like the open road! Let's go meet Jackpot. Hey, Party Pups. Let's celebrate. I'm so excited for the Sullivans. And you, Houdini? You're a lucky dog. Shane seems great. He is. He's perfect for them. Are you guys ready to party? Oh yeah. Indubitably. Oh man, this place is a jackpot! When you said the houses on this block were nice, I didn't think they'd be nice. Oh yeah. The kids on this block, they get 20, 50, sometimes $100 in their birthday cards. And then, during the holidays-- oh man, forget about it. It's a free for all. We're talking play stations, Xboxes, iPads, Barbie Dreamhouses. Barbie Dreamhouses? What? I got a niece. She needs gifts, too. Right. Oh, the Holy Grail. Crusher, stop! Is it the fuzz? Hey, hey, I swear, I didn't do anything. Uh, uh, I'm just a patsy for this guy. Will you relax? We haven't even done anything illegal. Yet. Who lives there? Uh, uh, that's the Sullivan house. Yeah. Oh, nice joint. Bet they got a lot of nice stuff there. Oh yeah, they got a lot of good swag. I know 'cause I delivered most of it myself. Oh yeah? Like what? Oh, we're talkin' uh, flat screen TVs, pool table, huge surround sound system. Oh yeah. M-- Mrs. Sullivan just got a nice Peloton bike, too. Really nice. Oh wee! I got a good feeling about this place. But wow! Consider them on the hit list. Target numero uno. Uh, what does that mean? I don't know. It's Latin or Italian or something. It's like a card game thing. Yeah, yeah. You wanna play for money? No, I don't got anything. Well, we will soon. A full house. Looks like the pot is all mine. Winner winner, kibble dinner. No fair. Why do you always win? You'd think we'd learn our lesson by now. But my calculations, you're due for a losin' hand at any moment. Oh yeah? What's the percentage? Now why would you have to go and do that? Hmm. Hmm. Oh, 72.3% to be exact. Oh, boggles my mind. Ew, gross. What'd you eat for dinner? It's just my genetic make-up. A release valve, if you will. Helps me think. Well, you better use your noggin' to figure out a way to stop it. Don't blame me. Blame science. And how is it with your incredible sense of smell that your release valve doesn't bother you? Hmm. Stupendous question. What does "stupendous" mean? Oh Jackpot. If only you had a bigger brain. Hey, remember who's bigger than you. What's that? I don't know. Let's go see. A delivery? At this hour? That's strange. Something's certainly rotten in Denmark. Uh, um, sorry. I was calculating the mail schedule. I don't think that's what he meant, Einstein. Let's check it out. I'll go first! Einstein, wait! Well, she's a proactive pug. Okay, so it's settled. We hit the Sullivan place when the kids are at school, the mother's workin'. Then we nail the Simpsons a few weeks after that. I don't know. This is gonna make me look bad. How are they gonna know it's you? 'Cause these are all homes on my route. Homes on the same block get hit all the time. What are these guys talking about? Yeah, but after we hit the first house, ain't they gonna be waiting for us? Yeah, it'd be nice to hit all of 'em at the same time, but how would a situation like that fall into our laps? It's not like the entire block is gonna go on vacation at the same time. So we start there? The Thompsons. No, don't! The Larrabys! Clean out your ears... -What? ...and pay attention. We hit up the Larraby place and then-- You and I are square. No, then we hit the Thompsons, and the Simpsons, and the Ogilvys. The Thompsons, the Simpsons, the Ogilvys? You wanna hit four places? Five, six, seven. Who's gonna stop us? Elliot Ness. No, no, no. Superman! That was a rhetorical thing. Um. Uh, yeah. They wanna rob the whole neighborhood. My place. The point is the cops in this town are bumbling at best. They're no match for my cunning. Yeah, Crush, you-- you just talk, you know? It's just the two of us. It's-- What's "cunning" mean? It means that we're gonna pull this off and no one's gonna stop us! Guys, Joyful Lane's in trouble. - Yeah? - Yeah! Someone has to do something. Oh, no, no, no. No, you're not doin' it right. It's-- I think that's up to us. I don't know. Are you sure that's a good idea? I can try and calculate. Please don't. If what I heard in there is true, we have to protect our neighborhood and show these crooks who really runs this block. We have to show them who's boss. Oh, oh, oh. You hear something? Yeah. It's like-- it's like heavy breathin'. Grandpa Crusher, is that you? It's not Grandpa Crusher, you dunderhead. It's-- Dogs! Why are you screamin'? It's just a mangy mutt. I'm definitely afraid of dogs! Seriously? You didn't have one growin' up? Dude, uh, times were different then! Now they're an occupational hazard! Oh geez. Okay, fine. I'll deal with this one. Get out of here. Scram! We're not going anywhere. Oh h-- hi, Doggies. It's-- it's just your good buddy Dean. I don't care who you are. I mean you no harm. I just wanna talk to your friend over here and get him out of the way, so we can leave and never come back. I promise. Yeah, right. We've heard about your plans. You're gonna attack the block! Now, you, Big Boy. If you wouldn't mind getting out of the way, so we can get this-- Dink! Hey! No! Hey, how did it go? Fantastic! We had tea and crumpets, and discussed the latest episode of Daniel Tiger. Oh my God! You watch that show, too? Uh, no, you moron! Look what those mangy mutts did to my sleeve! Oh, I thought you were just goin' for like the-- The punk rock look. Would you drive, please? We have to get out of here before someone comes. They're creatin' a commotion. Who? Who? The dogs, you nimwit! What-- Oh, your stupidity knows no depth. Just drive! Houdini! Houdini! What is it? A mail truck getting chased by dogs. Why would the mailman be delivering mail right now? Because he's the worst. I thought I heard you guys. What are you two doing up? Watching a mail truck get chased by dogs. Really? That sounds a little nuts. Are you sure you weren't dreaming? We definitely were not. No. Okay, well, let's get you both back in bed and go to sleep, okay? Hey, have you guys seen Houdini? Uh, no. I don't really know what dog you're referring to. Dominick. Dominick Sullivan. Is there something you know? He's down at the junkyard again. Dominick! Sorry. He's back down at the junkyard? Oh boy, he's in trouble. And someone's gonna get a stern talking to. All right, you two, get back in bed and go to sleep. Good night. Everyone did great. Junkyard dogs! We're-- Heroes! Houdini. Come here, boy. Houdini. Hey Mom. Happy to report the neighborhood dog watch is in full effect. Oh, Houdini. What did I tell you about getting into the junkyard? Hey, you're the one who tells us kids we need to play outside more. You smell like a saloon. We need to give you a bath. Come on, Houdini. Let's go give you a bath. -A bath? -Come on, baby. Come on, Houdini. You need to be cleaned up, you stink. No, Mom, please! Oh, these things are heavy. How do you put up with this every day? Your back okay? It's fine. Now my stomach, that's another story. Stomach? How's that? Allow me to demonstrate. Apple pie. Oh. Good. You want some? No, thank you. No sweets for me before 3:00 p.m. And you, Big Boy, you need to control yourself. It's not even lunchtime yet. Any time is a good time for pies. Sorry, Mr. Parker. No goodies for you today. Mm. That's a good breakfast. Crusher, you truly are one in a million. Oh, thanks, Boss. Yeah, it's not a compliment. So what side of the street am I on once we get out of here? So I'm thinking, you take the odds, I'll take the evens. Got it. Remember, we're lookin' for the houses with the stuffed mailboxes and then that's how we know they ain't at home. They're not here. How do you know they ain't there? Never mind. Odd, even. Even. Even. Hey, you're pretty good at that, huh? When this is all done, you can get a job with me, huh? Yeah, I won't count on it. We cordially invite you, yeah, yeah, yeah, on this special day of our union. Monica Sullivan and Shane DeSoto. Monica! She-- -Boss. -No. Boss, what-- what is it? I mean, what-- what's that-- what's that coming out of your eyes? I don't know. It's the moisture or something. Are you okay? I just said "I'm not okay". I'm not okay! What-- what's wrong? She's getting marryied. Oh yeah. Mrs. Sullivan, yeah, she's marryin' uh, the Shane. Hey, good guy. He's a really good guy. You're not helping! Give me this. She looks so beautiful. I was wondering if I could get the mail. Why? You ain't never seen a grown man cry before? Yeah, just not while he's delivering the mail. Hey, look. Being a mailman is a very hard, stressful job. You're on your feet 12 hours a day. You got the blistering sun comin' at you, the impenetrable hatred of dogs around the world. Mr. Crusher, Mr. Crusher, can I just please get my mail? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure thing, Mrs. Hope. There you go. Oh, he's fine. We don't finish the route, I'm gonna get in trouble. -I get in trouble, we-- -Yeah, no score. I get it! Right. It's okay. It's all right. There's plenty of birds in the sea. But they don't have wings like hers. I don't care how cute he is. Mom said not to feed him from the table. Oh, come on. Give me that sugar. Fine. If she said not to feed him at the table, I'll feed him on the floor. May the ghosts of relationships past cease to haunt me. Oh, mailman! The mailman! Mailman, the mailman's here! Mailman, the mailman is here! Hey, what you got today? Sorry, Pooch, but you can't g-- You! Wait a minute. I know you. You ruined my jacket! -Get off my porch. -Yeah. You can't get me, you mutt. I'm out here and you're stuck in there. I've had enough of this. Hey, dink, help! Help! This dog's crazy! Your dog's crazy. Houdini, no. What has gotten into you? We're so sorry, sir. Well, you should be. Your dog's vicious! He's not normally. Yeah, we've had him since forever and I've never seen him act like this. Well, he's acting like it now, isn't he? I have half a mind to call the police! The police? No, don't do that! Well, then keep him locked up. Huh? Hey, your mom home? No, she's uh-- Yeah, she's on a work call in her office. Why? No reason. You should just tell her to tell your neighbors to keep their mutts on a leash, too! Mm, the neighbors? Why? Because I see the dogs runnin' around the block like a pack of crazy Tasmanian-- Animals? It's like ani-- wild animals, yes! And there's a leash law in this community, if you didn't know. Study up, Kids. You'll learn somethin'. And I want that leash law followed, because if it's not, I will have animal control down here so fast, it will make your tiny little head spin! Yeah! Don't listen to him, guys. He's a bad egg. How come you're not wearing a uniform? What's that now? Yeah, why aren't you wearing mailman uniform? The other guy-- The dumb one. He wears a uniform. Yeah, uh, well, I um-- My-- it's in the cleaner's. I'll have it in a few days. Will that satisfy you? Uh-huh. Highly suspect. Definitely suspect. You kids just keep that dog on a leash and have yourselves a great rest of the day. Oh, by the way, uh, tell your mom congrats on the wedding. Oh yeah! It's going to be so fun! Everyone on the block is coming. Oh. How do you know about that? Yeah, how do you know? Well, it's uh, I j-- I hear the neighbors talkin', you know? News travels fast in small towns like this, okay? You kids, have a good rest of the day. Be good. Behave. Santa's watching. And that dog is on the nasty list. T I heard that. There's something weird about that guy. You don't have to say that again, Kiddo. Uh, yous-- yous wanted to see me, Boss? Yes, Crusher. Come in. Take a seat. Uh. Oh, wait. Oh, I get it! You're going for like the-- the whole uh, The Bond Villain thing, huh? You bet I am. Where'd you get that? I stole it off of Jimmy Harrison from the route. You did? Yeah! And it made me feel like a million bucks. Yeah. I'm telling you, this score is gonna be so cathartic. Yeah. Wait, why? You know that cute couple gettin' married? Miss Sullivan in 103? I dated her in high school. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Really? -Huh. Uh, you must have been a real lady killer. Uh. Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was. Yeah, it's just not workin' out. But how do you know? Trust me, I know. Call it "women's intuition". You're gonna be okay? Yeah. Good. See you around. She broke my heart. But now I get the last laugh, finally. What's the plan? It's going down in two weeks. Kirkland Town Church. Oh! The-- the-- the-- the one with the duck pond? That place is so... ...magical. Are they having the wedding there? I don't care. The only thing that matters is the whole block is invited. Monica's little trolls told me all about it. You saw the invites. Here's hopin' most of them RSVP Y-E-S. Wait, why? Because if even half of them say they're going, that's more stuff to gank and fewer prying eyeballs to catch us in the act! That's good. Wait, what about the dogs? For once, Crusher, you ask a good question. We're gonna take 'em down with this. That's a whistle. Nothing gets by you, Crusher. Ugh, Boss, Boss! Can you-- can you shut that off? That-- that's really annoying. Yeah, you think it's bad for you? It's 10 times worse for the dogs. It's gonna drive those mutts nuts! Oh, I hate them! Brilliant! We're gonna use this, and voilà, no more harassment from those junkyard dogs. But Mom, Houdini was just protecting the house. Yeah, Babe. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with a dog guarding his own home. Yeah, but you guys, if-- if he really did do this, he went way too far. But Mom, he's a bad guy. He ripped off a man's sleeve. He deserved it. That's a little bit more than guarding. I just-- I just don't know why. I never thought Houdini would do something like this and it's just so-- so disappointing. But Mom, we've had Houdini for a long time. He wouldn't have done what he just did out of the blue. V Yeah. Okay, so then why did he do it? Because that mailman is up to something. The guy today just seemed weird. Totally suspicious. And we saw the mail truck last night, blazing up and down the street, being chased by dogs. What Dominick said, he wasn't joking. It's all true. -Is that true? -Cross my heart. Isn't that just a little bit weird? A little bit. But a-- a mailman running late on his route doesn't make him a criminal. Midnight isn't running late. Midnight equals devious deeds. Definitely devious. I gotta be honest. It does sound a little devious. The mailman isn't the problem, trust me. Mommy, do you not love Houdini anymore? Yeah, Mom. Do you not love me? Of course, I love Houdini. Honey, don't misunderstand me, please. Houdini is part of our family. But I-- i don't-- I don't want him to get into trouble. If he hurts someone, they could take him away from us. So that's why from now on he is on double secret probation. What's that? What does that mean? That means no more doors opening, no more tunneling, no more jumping fences, no more gates being unlatched, no more escaping at all. No escaping? Because Houdini, I know you sneak out late at night and let out your furry little friends. So from now on, Houdini is gonna be sleeping in my bed. And after dinner every single night, we are going to shut and lock that window. But Mom, he's not the problem! Sweetie, yes, he is. Now let's go inside. We are gonna make this house like Fort Knox. You guys really should trust me. Okay. Yeah. Oh no. They're back. What is it, Houdini? What is it? Is there a fire at the old mill? Not a fire, but something is definitely brewing. They're bad, aren't they? Really bad. Two barks for yes, Houdini. I have to do something about this. Mom has to know that we're being serious. But how? We're just kids! I don't know yet. But when the time is right, we're gonna find out what they're up to, and we're gonna help Houdini bring those guys down. Don't worry, guys. I'm on the case. That's it. Close those eyes. And we're off! What the-- What? Oh no, she didn't! Come on, Houdini, you got this. Nah. Come on, Houdini, think. Think, think. How do we get out of here? Wait a second. That's it! Just need to get this open. Let's see here. What will work best? Salad? Eggs? Heck no. Pizza? Oh yeah. That's the ticket. Bless us, oh Father, for the bounty I'm about to devour. I promise I do this not for my appetite but for the greater good of the Sullivan family. Amen. Don't have to go yet. Looks like I'm diving back in. Woof. I think that should do it. Oh boy. Yup, it's about that time. I may have overdone it. Oh, oof, oof. Oh. I knew I shouldn't have eaten all that kibble. Oh, dog! What have I done? Mom, I already finished my homework. Mom, wake up! Can I go out and play now? Lady, you have about 60 seconds. I don't know. Wake up. Come on! Come on! I don't know what that smell is. It's not a bouquet of roses. But if you don't get up now, you're gonna find out. -Come on, Mom. Come on. -Oh gosh. What is that smell? Is it a fire? No. There's a fire coming from somewhere else, though. Oh no. Let's get you out of here. Hurry up. Let's go. Excuse me. Gotta take care of some business. Oh, it's chilly. Okay, let's find a good spot. Oh, here we go. Hey, can a dog get some privacy, please? Okay, I'm gonna let you do your business. I'm gonna leave the door open for you. Thanks, Mom. I may be here for a while, so don't wait up. My business is gonna take all night. Hmm, mission accomplished. The night is mine. Einstein, you there? You okay? What are you doing? Trying not to breathe. You should be ashamed of yourself. Hey, don't judge me. It was the only way I could escape. Well, then let's escape this block lickety-split. Fine by me. Do that thing with your mighty nose. Found 'em. They're at Marvin Street Apartments. They have anchovy pizza with a side of wings. Buffalo wings. Oh yeah. And a side of blue cheese. Man, those two are ripe! You truly are the Rudolph of sniffin'. Thanks. Now let's go see what our friends are up to. That is the smallest TV I've ever seen. This, fool, is not a TV. It's a computer. Hmm? Oh yeah? Then how come I saw you watching your soaps on it earlier? You did. Then how is it not a TV? Because, doof, you can't hack into somebody's Evite on a television. That's the invitation there? Yup. We were handin' those out the other day. How 'd they get on there? This is the RSVP list. Monica and Shane asked them to reply electronically. Got it. So uh, how can we tell who's goin'? I'm pullin' it up right now. It's our lucky day. Why is that? Everyone said "yes"! Oh, really? For serious? Every house on the street! My man, we're gonna be rich. We're gonna be rich. I smell a lot of trouble for Joyful Lane. How are we gonna stop them without our humans? Think, Houdini. Think. I would love to see the look on that adorable little couple's face when they come home to an empty house. And then you can make her pay for dumpin' you! Hey, oh, oh, she didn't dump me. She didn't break up with me. It was mutual. It was a mutual break-up. You're breaking up with me? Yeah. It's just not workin' out between us. Loser. It was mutual. It was. It's one I've been regretting ever since. But only at nights. And maybe holidays. Some weekends, and Mondays can be hard. Whatever, right? Whatever. We-- when we pull this off, she's gonna get her comeuppance, right? Huh. But I thought you said it was a mutual break-up? Yeah, I did! Yeah, wait, it is! Whatever. It was. Whatever. I gotta work now. You know, some people work. We going 50-50 on this? This is stupid. Can we watch my show on the TV? TV's over there. They're talking about the wedding. The wedding. That's it. We got the upper hand on those schemers. We do? We know exactly when they're going to strike. If we get the junkyard dogs to assemble, we can thwart these amateurs. With your nose and brain, Jackpot's brawn and mighty bark, my ears and astonishing powers of escape, and our collectively dashing good looks-- We've got this. Tomorrow night, we'll draw up our plans at the junkyard. Let's do it. Houdini! Uh-oh. Looks like I'm in the doghouse again. Uh, hello, Mr. Crusher. Nice to see you delivering the mail before dinnertime. What can I say, Mrs. Hope? I got up on the right side of the bed this morning. You have a good one. Hi there. Einstein, isn't it? You have a fine day, Pooch. I don't like that guy. The crème de la crme. The crown jewel of the block. Crème de la crime. Excuse me! Oh, hey there. Hi there, sir. Hi. - Yeah, can I help you? - Hi there. Hi. Yeah, how are you today, sir? I'm good. You? Yeah, I'm just uh, you know, doin' the daily routine. You know, slingin' that mail. I don't wanna pull a-- a gastrocnemius. It's medical. You don't worry about it. You wanna tell me what you doin' lookin' in the windows? - Say what now? - The windows. The what? The things you looked through. Oh, the w-- yeah, the-- Oh, ah, yeah, I uh, I just uh, wanted to make sure uh, Miss Sullivan had the dog tied up. Oh, wait a minute! -You're the guy that had the-- -Yeah, both sleeves ripped off. Oh hey, my gosh. We are so sorry about that. Monica is so sorry that that happened. Yeah, well, it's okay. Things happen. Yeah, well, we wanna make sure that it never happens again. It's just Houdini is-- He's a good puppy. He's just very protective of the kids and the house, you know? Yeah, a little. Yeah. I totally get that. Yeah. Uh-- oh hey, here's your mail. Maybe I'll see you around there, Mister... Uh, DeSoto. Shane DeSoto. Shane, Shane. Nice to meet you, Shane. Yeah. Good-looking guy. He's so good-looking. I'm-- I'm Jimmy. Jimmy uh, Dean. Jimmy Dean. Like the breakfast sausage guy? Yes, we have a bingo in row one. Hold your cards for confirmation. Yeah. Uh, like that guy. Uh, Mom loved that stuff. Yeah, she couldn't get enough. Hmm. Well, thanks. Yeah, have a great rest of the day. Oh hey. Congratulations, huh, on the upcoming nuptials. Oh, thank you. Uh, yeah, Monica. Oh yeah. Miss Sullivan is uh, she's-- she's so-- She uh, I mean, I-- she looks-- she seems like a lovely lady. You're-- you're-- you're a lucky man. - Well, thanks. - Yeah. I think. Yup, yup. So handsome. I hate him. He's crazy good-lookin'! I wish I had kids that looked like him. Supermodels, payin' for college, I wouldn't owe a dime. Wow. Hey Mom. Okay, you behave tonight. Okay? Come here. I'll be a good boy. Will you behave tonight? Okay. I will. I promise. Let's behave tonight. Thank you. All right. Good night. Good night. Good thing I had my paws crossed. Einstein, I'm here! Much obliged, Friend, but I can't believe you got out. No matter how hard they try, they can't stop a pup on a mission. You really are a master of your craft. Thanks. Now let's get Jackpot in on this. Hi ya, Soldiers. Thanks for comin'. You're welcome, Buddy. Let's blow this doggie treat stand. Why the rush? Something going on? We shouldn't dilly-dally. We've got a lot to talk about. That's right. We've got work to do. Come on! Junkyard Dogs, listen up. Last night, I did some investigating. I mean, we, we did some investigating and we uncovered a sinister plot by those two no-goodniks moonlighting as mailmen. What? They're not only wanting to rob the Larrabys' place, but they're planning to rob the whole entire block. Are you serious? Like a pulmonary embolism. I'm not gonna lie. At first, this was disconcerting to me, too. But I realized that we could do something. What do you mean? Individually, it's hard for us pups to do anything. But as a group, if we work together, using our independent skills, we could stop those crooks dead in their tracks. You saw what we did the other night against those two. It's true. Our probability of success rises-- oops, 90% if we work together. How are we gonna do that? We work as a team. This is our neighborhood and we have to defend it. Indeed it is. Where do these thieves get off trying to tread on my hard-earned property? I saved the best for last. We know when they're going to pull off this caper. The day of Monica and Shane's wedding. That's great news! Then we have the element of surprise. So what do we do? We use our best assets. Jackpot, I don't think I need to tell you What your superpower is. Just be ready to unleash that roar. Roger that. And I use my superior sense of smell and love of science. That's correct. We use our skills. But we've got to be prepared. This whole thing is going down on the 21st during Monica and Shane's wedding. That's only two days away. Right. After your owners leave, start setting up your home defenses. Then I'll just come let you guys out. We'll sniff out which way they're coming using Einstein's radar and spring on those crooks as soon as they arrive. What kinda defenses or booby traps are we talkin' here? That's where you come in. Let's get that brain of yours to work. All right, Junkyard Dogs, there's no time to waste. Let's get started. All right. You go there, and-- and you go to that pile, and I'll put this here. Oh, this looks good. First, we go to zis house. Next, zis house. Okay, what else do we need? Over there. Grab that crowbar. Roger that. I got it. Every house in the Frenchie cul-de-sac... ...is gonna get sacked. Okay? I'll put this in my mouth. You might need this. You guys are doing great. Got it. Looking good, gang. Oh, I am speaking with a German accent. I think that's everything. This is gonna be great. These guys have no idea what's about to hit 'em. Houdini, how do I look? Two barks for uh, drop-dead gorgeous or one bark for not so much. Aw, you crack me up! I know, Mom. I know. And you look beautiful. You crack me up. Oh, this is just such an exciting day. I never thought this day would ever come. All right, let's get you dressed. No way, Mom. I'm not wearing that again. -No, no, no way. -What is the matter? What, you don't like this still? I love you, Mom, but this thing is ugly. All right, fine. I do admit, it is a little tacky. Although, I thought you looked really cute. Okay, fine. We'll just go with this one. Nope. Not gonna do it. Houdini. Houdini, come on. You have to wear something, please. Sorry, Mom. It's not that I don't care. It's just that I have important matters to attend to. You're gonna still look so handsome. You do, my baby. Fine. But if you want me to go, you're gonna have to catch me. No, no, no! Come back here, Mister. Mister! Ava, you gotta tell Mom I can't go to the wedding. I gotta stay home! This is not good. Einstein and Jackpot need me. What's the matter, boy? Mum, Houdini seems spooked. There you go, Dominick. We gotta get her attention. He probably thinks we're goin' to the vet. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be wearing a bowtie if we were going to the vet. Mom, the mail truck! What? The mail truck! Yeah, it just passed us. Well, what about it? It was goin' to our house. Those guys are up to no good. Guys, come on. You know I love you, right? You both are the most important people in my life. Hey, what about me? Houdini, you're the most important dog in my life. But today's a big day for us. Let's focus on that. And not on some conspiracy theories about the mailman, okay? Mom, but we know that they're up to no good. Yeah, they have it written all over them. I said "enough". I don't wanna hear any more about it, okay? Okay? -Okay. -Okay. Okay. Now who's ready to get married? Don't worry, Kids. Looks like this one's up to me. The traps are set and we're ready to meet. Do you copy, Houdini? Houdini? Einstein, can you get me a read on Houdini's position? Copy that. That's strange. Oh no! He's not here! Monica's bringin' him to the wedding. Oh no! We must move to Plan B. I repeat, Angel is subdued. We must defend our own places. We're on our own now? Gazooks! Jackpot, incomin'! They're on their way. Let's get to work. What's gotten into you? You need to calm down. R You need to calm down. And we will come back for you when the ceremony starts. Until then, behave. Sorry, Bud. Got to make sure you don't get into trouble. And what do you think you're gonna do with those? These people don't know who they're messing with. This is ridiculous. Those guys have no idea what's comin'. Door is locked, Boss. No kiddin'. So what do we do now? You break into it. I hear like humans are supposed to be the smartest of all animals. You sneak in there, you steal the stuff, while I go to the next place. Divide and conquer. You have the whistles, yeah? The whistles. No, I don't have the whistles. You don't-- don't tell me you don't have the-- You don't have the-- Don't t-- don't tell me you have the-- You don't have the w-- I just-- I can't trust you with anything. Just get the loot. Get the loot. Sorry, Boss. You got it. Yeah, yeah. Meet me out here. I gotta draw you a map? Just-- Count on me, Boss. Yeah, yeah. Ready to hit a trip? These people. Out of their gords. Oh. What is this? Glue? Hey, what you doin' there? Gotcha. Crusher, it's a trap! The dogs are onto us! Help! Help! It's a trap! The dogs are onto us! What? Hey-- Boss, I can't hear you! Hey. This thing won't budge! Have a good fall. Oof, that's gotta hurt. Oh! Oh, come-- Oh, you mutts! Crusher, where are you? What's the problem? Looks like you got yourself into a little pickle. Come on! Come here, you mutt. Oh, you... Come on, Crush! Crusher! Help! I'm coming, Boss! Oh, look at me. I'm a dumb human and I can't use my hands. Oh, I am gonna get you, Mutt! Crusher! What's wrong? Oh, stop! Get me off of here. I'll try. One, two. Maybe ease up on the apple pies. Now to deal with those creeps. You okay, Boss? Yeah, don't worry about me. Grab the mutt. Hey, come get me, you nitwits. Oh boy. Get him! Jackpot, now! Incoming. Did somebody order a hammer? And stay down. Oh no. Where did he go? Houdini! Houdini, where are you? We have to find him. Must save the neighborhood. Must save the neighborhood. Squirrel! I'm gonna get you, devil of the land! Those mutts. I can't believe you forgot the whistles. Hey, you gave me a long list of stuff to bring. Oh, great, yeah, now-- now you're blamin' me for this. You're lucky I think ahead. I brought backups. That's why you're the brain to this operation, Boss. Yeah, don't hurt yourself. Whistles? Jackpot, they have whistles! Oh! Oh, my ears! I'll get you next time, Squirrel. Now it's time for these guys to go down. Hey, get your hands off of me, you brute! One down, two to go. Have you guys seen my kids? Shane! Babe? Yeah, I know. It's the kids. Have you seen them? Uh, no. Not in a while. Why? Because they're not here. You gotta be kidding me. I'm not kidding you. They were supposed to be with the wedding party, and none of the women have seen them. Okay, okay. Oh, all right. I got this. Um, ladies and gentlemen um, first of all, thanks for coming and uh, we're gonna get to this in a minute. But has anyone seen Dominick or Ava? I saw them outside about 10 minutes ago. Are you sure that it was them? Positive. Definitely your two. Couldn't miss 'em. Oh, I need to find a way out of here. Hey, hey, what-- what are you doin'? -Get this thing off of me. -Jackpot! Oh, don't put me in there. You're gonna regret this! Einstein, you okay? I'm fine. But we need to find a way to stop these guys. It's no use. Only Houdini could get us out of this. Wasn't our probability supposed to rise 90% as a group? I may have miscalculated the number? Oh, Einstein. This isn't good. Hold on. I think I've got somethin'! Is that who I think it is? The big one's close. No. No. nope. There you are. Now it's your turn. Woah! Have a nice nap, Big Guy. Now it's time for your friend. Going somewhere? Well, well, well. If it isn't Houdini. The hero pup. Well, well, well. If it isn't the world's worst criminal. You made a real mess of my heist, boy. And you're makin' a real mess of my neighborhood. Now you're gonna pay. There they are. I can't believe they're up here. I mean, out on the street by themselves. They-- they're like walking down the street. -Houdini! -Houdini! Hey, you two. You better have a very good reason for leaving the wedding. It's Houdini. He's gone. What? - We went-- - He's not with you? We went to go check on him. He wasn't there. So we decided to look for him. Kids, you can't just leave without telling us. It's dangerous. Yeah. A-- and do you have any idea where he's at? Duh, Mom. He went home. To stop those mailmen. -Dominick! -Dominick! Guys, we're not makin' this up. You need to believe us. All right, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna get in the car, we're gonna go home, we're gonna make sure everything is fine, we're gonna grab Houdini, and we're gonna come back. And get married, and then the three of you will owe Shane and I an apology. Now get in the car. Now. Let's go. Oh no, you don't! Oh! No! No! Looking for this? Oh, you'll pay for this, Mutt. Not as much as you'll pay after the cops get you. Oh yeah. Oh no, hello. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's not too late for us to be friends. Poochie. Hey, hey, if I put all this stuff back, maybe we can work somethin' out? Yeah, right. Okay, maybe not. Look who's the stickler. Okay. Is that a ham bone? Ham bone! Cheeseburger! Drunk squirrel! What? You afraid of a little dog like me? Come out and face me like a man. Uh-oh. Okay, Pup. I'm comin' out, you stupid mutt! Just give up, Pup, so you can join your friends! Junkyard Dogs! Where are you? Houdini needs our help! We need to get this muzzle off you. Who's the top dog now? Come on, come on. This guy's going down. Hey guys, I'm comin' in. Houdini, you're okay! Now let's get you guys out of here. Now let's put these criminals away. Doggy doo-doo. No, no, please. Come on. Where do you think you're goin'? Come on. The gig is up! You're not going anywhere, Bub. All right, Pups. Okay, I give up. You win. You're goin' away for a long time. Don't mess with the junkyard dogs. I'm not getting my ever and I hate prison. Go ahead and disregard the chase. We got him. Hi Detective, uh, what's going on? Ma'am, do you live here? Uh, yes, we live here. Is everything okay? It seems like you and your neighbors have had some known criminals casing your streets. Dean? Monica. You know that guy? Jimmy Dean, like the breakfast sausage guy. That-- that guy's our mailman. Definitely not our mailman. You and I both know each other. We went to high school together. I know. Many moons ago. We actually dated, briefly. Yeah, you dumped him. Hey, hey. No. Wait, what? He was a horrible boyfriend. Don't worry about it. Oh! I'm standing right here. Well, it doesn't seem like much has changed. The two of them are posin' as postmen and they attempted to rob the entire block while everyone was away. Told you so, Mom. Seems like you owe us an apology. You're right. I'm so sorry. I found that one with a number Of people's belongings in his possession. That's hearsay, Your Honor. Monica, Monica, I've waited so long. I would've really gotten away with it, too, If it wasn't for you pesky kids. - You guys look wonderful. - She smells good. - Beautiful. - Thank you. Beautiful. But somehow, thanks to this dog and his canine friends, it looks like they were able to stop them. Uh, the dogs? That's the only thing we can figure. Everyone on the block was at your wedding. They were the only ones here to defend it. They truly are the real heroes. I told you I had something important to do. Houdini, how could I ever repay you? A treat would be nice. Come here, boy. Good boy. Thank you so much. Thank you. You're welcome, Mom. I just wanted to save the family. -Uh, Mom. -Yeah? Aren't we forgetting something? Yeah. -Oh! Oh yeah! -Oh! Oh yeah! Uh, maybe we should-- Probably. - Yeah. - Yeah. -Let's go. -Shall we? -Yeah, we have a wedding to do. -Come on, Kids. Yes, let's go! Good job, Officer. I'll take care of it. Go ahead, please. Yeah. You may now kiss the bride. I can't believe you used to date that guy. Yeah, me neither. -I love you. -I love you, too. Yay! Hurray for Monica and Shane! All in all, it was a good time. Monica, don't deny your love! I saw the glint in her eye. I think I still got a pretty good chance. So boss, tell me. Does this make us square? No, we're not square, you dummy! We're goin' away for a long time! Well, at least there ain't no dogs there, huh? -I hate those junkyard dogs! -I hate those junkyard dogs! Oh. Kids! You said it a long time ago. Yeah. No, Darby. Come, leave it. 8. Alpha 8, beta 8, scene 3. Marker. - Oh, buck up. - Twist, twist, twist! Where is she? Did she clock out? Come on. Excuse me, Miss. More pudding. It's a union job? And you say, "You were." Remember? Yes, but I didn't know-- When you were stopping talk. Tell me that you that you can't wait to spend the rest-- -Okay, I don't want to st-- -Go ahead, good. Uh, nothing, I just thought-- How about that light comin' down? Oh, Sweet Babe, thank you for having my back. Oh my God, we're gonna have to give you a bath. I know you wanna play, but you know what, Houdini? We gotta go have a bath. Monica. - Cut! - Cut it! Hmm. Oh shoot, I messed up. Yeah, me. too. What are you guys, from corporate? Can you play Super Mario on there? Yeah, but I'm not going to. Okay, guys, thank you. - Okay. - Tails. Yes. Coming up. Come here. Get him! Run the other way, you little-- -I hate those junkyard dogs! -I hate those junkyard dogs! I--
