OXYGEN VACUUM AIR Mom! RADIATION DANGEROUS TO EYES AND SKIN - I want my mom! - Tomek, stop crying, you hear? - I want my mom! - Please stop. - Mom! - If you're naughty it will hurt more. - Mom! PRESCRIPTION SHEET Be quiet, please go to sleep this very minute. I want my mom! Darling, please try to fall asleep. Tomorrow you'll be rested. Mom will come. It will be a new day. Doctor, the boy in no. 14 is very agitated. Couldn't we give him something? It's been nearly 3 hours. I really can't handle him. Thank you, I won't need you. - But, doctor, perhaps we'll have to... - I said I'd manage. Mom! Mom! The sun wandered, Smiling, bright, golden Over the grove, over the meadow. It met a teary-eyed orphan: 'You're shining with such joy.' 'With such joy, my dear sun,' 'You send around your smiles' 'While my eyes are filled with tears.' PATIENTS' BATHROOM If it holds true in the fairy tales you were told as a child, it is all the more true for the magic of science. Among and around us, there are forces -- let me call them magical powers -- and they are much more powerful, more amazing and their wonders more beautiful than the spells of fairy-tale wizards. Thousands of people live and die without ever caring to open their eyes and see the sweet calm and the marvels of nature. Thank you, that's all very interesting, but enough for today. Are you in pain? No, today doesn't hurt at all. Go now, I want to pray in peace. I'll just bring you some water and then turn off the light. Are you ill? Perhaps I'll bring you something from the kitchen? Thank you, there's no need. It's so wonderful to sit down, if only for a moment, and think about nothing. I feel I will sleep well tonight. That's wonderful. You won't need your sleeping pills. He wants to kill me. Murderer, he's a murderer. He'll be away again all night. He's doing it on purpose, he wants to destroy me. He does it on purpose, with that nasty smile stuck on his face. I shouldn't have had a child with him. His sight will always make me puke. It was an accident. A terrible coincidence. And besides, I'm old. Old women don't give birth to healthy children. You shouldn't think or talk like that. There's no truth in what you say. Not a grain! I'll tell you a big secret: this will be a proof, you will give birth to a beautiful, wise girl, you'll call her Ursula. Till the day you die, you'll thank God for giving her to you and teaching you to love. - You think so? - I know so. Please don't be afraid. The labor will be easy and painless. My mom was 51 when I was born. And she didn't mind it a bit. Because I was a love child. She wanted to call me Rose but daddy wouldn't have it. He wanted to call me Maria. Like our Virgin Lady. You should be glad, not worried. - You think so? - I am sure. It won't be long. THE QUEEN OF ANGELS Jacob! I had told you so many times to let me know when you're going to be late. I don't know if you're aware, but we have a telephone: 48-85-36. You needed only a minute. What am I saying, a minute! Ten seconds! Dad, come on! Sometimes I'm glad your mother can't see what you're turning into. Can you hear me? Open the door! Open up this minute! And turn down this infernal music! I give you ten seconds. Do you hear? I'm turning off the breakers. Jacob... Please, open the door... Open the door... When we lost mother and Adam I cried weeks on end, my eyes were swollen from crying. I wanted to die. You led your life as usual. You laughed, enjoyed candy, kicked the ball with friends. That made it possible for me to survive. I thought: God took away my wife and my son, but did not abandon me altogether since he spared someone I have to live for. And somehow it worked. Somehow, twenty years have passed. But now I think of her again more and more often. My son comes home only to spend the night. He doesn't want to have anything to do with me. He doesn't want to talk to me, doesn't shower, smokes a pack of cigarettes a day, and keeps telling me that everything is all right. I can't take it anymore. I can't. Say something. Talk to me. Talk to me. Say something. Cold. I'm cold. Nothing but worries. It would be best to sleep and never to wake up again. Why are you just sitting there? Do something. You call this a bed! It's a mere shake-down. A plain old shake-down. This idiot Cecilia starched everything so much I'm sure to get bedsores. Does she want me to rot alive? When I think that Reverend Waclaw will visit us today for the last time, I feel like crying. He's the only honorable man. The only helpful soul I have left. We must talk to him. About you. Maybe he will think of something. - A way out... - Mother! I don't understand. What are you referring to? What do you want to talk to him about? What are you going to turn into a problem? Oh, excuse me, it was you who created a problem. It was you! It was you who got involved with that wicked man who didn't love you even for ten minutes. It was you who ran after him frenzied to hear him talk to you about love. He slithered like a snake, grinned with his pointy pearly teeth, and so what?! - What did that give you? - Mother, please... - Do we really have to do this today? - Be quiet! Not another word! The only thing you can do is to clasp your hands and pray to God to help you go on. Woman! You are going to bear and raise a child! Do you even realize what that means? To raise a child on your own, with no husband, no money! You better listen to me and get down on your knees.... Right now, right here, no need to be shy about prayer. And ask for God's help in surviving all of this. Mother... please... They will be here any minute. You don't want this young man to take to his heels before he can say 'God bless...'? He will run anyway, as soon as he finds out what goes on in this house. May God bless you... Wacek, dear, I already thought you'd forgotten all about me. That I would have to die without... Please forgive me, my dear, we were detained. It's somewhat embarrassing. I thought that I, God's faithful servant, have absolutely no possessions. But when it came to packing, I collected fifteen large trunks. Books, of course... Nothing but books. Ladies, please allow me to introduce Rev. Jacob Kruk [lit. Crow] who took over my parish two days ago. I would like to add straight away that Reverend Jacob is exceptionally honorable and consequently also very modest. Maria, bring Reverend some tea. My dear Wacek, our guest is undoubtedly a nice young man but you forgot to mention he couldn't speak. Ladies, please accept my apologies but I am not in the best form today, that is, to be honest, I feel quite poorly. Upset stomach. I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave you for a moment. I'll show you to the bathroom, Reverend. Please follow me. I tried so hard, so hard, I cried every night praying that you come. I knew you wouldn't fail me, I saw you in my dreams, four times, angel. my angel, my guardian angel. I give myself to you, all of me, I'm giving you my love. Today I'm touching your body and I will never be who I was. Thanks be to God. The younger lady did not sleep a wink. all night... She walked around the house, - like a ghost. - Precisely. And she didn't even touch her meal. I've no idea who I am cooking for. They don't care. The old lady won't eat anything, and it looks like the younger one won't either. Waste of time and effort. - Precisely... - I don't mean to forebode... but if this continues who can tell where the unborn will end up. The lady is thin as a stick, bags under her eyes, her nails are white... We have even pickled beets for her... and some fresh ground pork loin would be good, one tablespoon three times a day. I wouldn't touch raw meet, either. Give her what she likes. What she likes, what she likes! Do I look like dumb? Like if it's my first day cooking here! Because of that child, she doesn't like anything. But I think that all this is not because of the child, but because of the father. She got an urge, so now God is punishing her. Shut up you idiot! Watch the roux, it's getting burned! You watch out, someone will smack you in your big mouth! But on our street, there used to live a certain Mrs Zawistowska. A beautiful woman. And she lived with a man twenty years her junior! But what happened afterwards is too scary to repeat. Well? Go on, you idiot. You're doing us no favors. A child. He got her pregnant. At the beginning, she would show off her bump, she had lots of little clothes made, but then, all of a sudden, no belly! And there is no child. But everything came out anyhow. Because God gave people a sign. It was in February. Snow, terrible cold, but in front of their house a magnolia tree flowered... ...red. They say God punished her because her lover was twenty years younger, and they never married. They say that the child was born dead. Didn't survive even a minute in this world. Didn't even whimper. It only opened its eyes, one little tear rolled down its cheek, and sighed its last breath... So that child -- a boy, it was a boy -- had two heads. One head was normal, but with only one eye in the middle of the forehead. But the other head... the other was a pig's head. A pig's head? You're a pig's head! I told you to watch the roux! Get out of here! I said get out, or I'll call the police. They should take you straight to bedlam. There must be one opened at night somewhere. Let them check you right in. Stuff you with pills. Pills. Or plug you into electricity. Electricity. You were supposed to visit him. You were supposed to take care of him. Maybe play with him sometimes. You never had the time. I understand. You didn't feel like it. I understand. I'm trying and I understand. It's only too bad you never imagined that a cat, every cat must eat and drink or it dies. Too bad. Too bad. I don't want you. I don't love you. I don't love you. I hate you, you hear?! I hope you starve to death like this cat. My keys. My keys! Give me back my keys! And now get lost; I'm calling the police. I love you. That's wonderful! Like a fairy tale! When I was young, one could only dream about such flowers! Please sit down. Reverend, forgive me for saying it, but it's a sin. Such wonders... for an old hag who's standing over her grave... I really don't know how I can apologize for my behavior on my last visit. It's just that I've been suffering from particularly painful upset stomach. Heavy cramps. And my nerves. New duties, new people... Not another word! When I first saw you I could feel that you are a wonderful servant of God, Reverend. Please believe me, I'm never wrong in these matters. One or two more weeks, and you will feel here quite at home. Rev. Waclaw recommended Dr. Kawecki whose insight and learning you are familiar with. He said this was a grave matter, to do with nerves... My dear boy, please don't pay attention to doctors. If I listened to that idiot Kawecki I would have been long gone from this world. Together, let's seek remedy in God. He won't fail us. Marysia, what's wrong with you, I must have rang six times! I'm very sorry, I'm not feeling too well. Perhaps you should see Dr. Kawecki... But no, ask Cecilia to give you those herbal drops he prescribed, they're excellent. They relieve all ailments, literally everything. Dear God, I almost forgot. Relieve this poor suffering man and put these flowers in water. Beautiful flowers. Beautiful. I'll ask Cecilia to crush the tips of the stems and scald them with hot water. They'll last longer. I thought about it day and night. I thought... I thought about the fact that so many people... Love. Love. Strife. I wanted to love... I wanted... to tell her about myself. I wanted her to love me. I did not mean to hurt her. She couldn't understand me. She couldn't... relate to me, empathize... My heart is... so heavy and so... so big... Twenty-one kilos. It beats slow. Very slow. You're feverish, you should go to bed. You know you can't park here? Yes, I do. You know what? Go home. Take some pills, get some slep, calm down, take off work for a few days. Doctors have the right to get sick, too, don't they? There's something I must tell you. Something very important. Very. Something no one else must know. Priest. The moon will be so bright tonight. Silver-like. Willow-green. Willow-green moons are the most terrible. But I'm no longer afraid of the moon. I remember as a little boy I lay in bed at night and thought that moonlight sat on top of me, crushing me. It smelled so strange, like a corpse. Then I held my breath in terror. Absolutely. I might have been breathless for hours. I might have been close to death. This was when my mother had died. But a guardian angel saved my life. He swooped in, placed his hand over my face, and I was able to breathe again. Let me go!! Let me go!! Get away... I couldn't deny myself one last painful pleasure of placing a kiss on the dead lips of the one who had taken possession of my heart. O miracle! Her slight breath mingled with mine and Clairemonte's lips responded to the touch of mine. She opened her arms and wrapped them around my neck in ecstasy. Romuald, is that you? She asked in a voice trembling and faint like a harp's last quiver. Oh, Romuald, I have waited for you so long... that I died... I love you. I give you the life your kiss has reawakened. Adieu, Romuald, adieu! A sudden gust of wind opened a window and burst into the room. The last white rose petal fluttered on its stem as a bird's wing and flew out the open window carrying with it Clairemonte's soul. My God! My God, Zofia will kill me! Dear Miss Maria, I'm not accustomed to corresponding with ladies. I trust you understand that my vocation seldom gives me an occasion for it. However, your behavior during my first, and undoubtedly not the last visit at Elzbieta Sklodowska's house compelled me to react in such an abrupt and decisive manner. I know that your faith is strong and profound. I have therefore decided that I would pray for your suffering soul to regain its peace. I will ask the Almighty to chase away the demons which -- I am absolutely certain of it -- have found a dark refuge in your heart. I believe that Jesus Christ will be your cure and salvation. As His faithful servant, I forgive you for what had happened. Having overcome my own weakness, I ask that you desist from trying to have any sort of contact with me, in any form whatsoever. This is a request of utmost importance. Please find your strength and your peace of mind in the Lord. Father Jacob Kruk You pig! Where have you brought me? My God! What are you going to do to me? You idiot! You idiot! You sadist! You've seen too many movies! You're sick! You're sick! God, why did I ever have anything to do with you? Help...! Help! Help! Help! Help! Anyone! Help! Help me! My God... My God... Jacob... Jacob...? Please, Jacob... Everything will be all right, you'll see... We can talk about whatever you want. In peace. Really... I can understand anything. I will understand everything. Jacob, I only beg you to... let me out of here... Don't touch me. You musn't touch me. He keeps looking at her. He can't stop thinking how good she is, how beautiful. How big her eyes are. Her blue eyes. His heart is beating very fast. Very fast. He wants to marry her, have children with her. A boy and a girl. He buys her flowers and treats. He takes her for walks by the river. Sometimes... he gently touches her hand. Her parents adore him. Her father, who who loves her more than life, will give her away without any second thoughts. Because he has sun in his eyes, and love. So powerful is love. What did you do that for? I had to. What did you do that for? To tell you. Tell me what? Something very important. When will this end? Soon. Very soon. I'll let you go tomorrow. What are you going to do to me? I want you to look and listen. I want you to try. Then you will hear and see. And you will love again. You? Yes. I won't ever love you again. You will. I don't know, I just don't know what to do. I've tried a hundred times to bring her to reason. In vain. My daughter, my own daughter, has no God in her heart any more. Even if she renounced God I believe that God never abandoned her and will show her the way. She wanders at night like a ghost, listens, watches out for the signs of his return. Will he ever return? And if he does, when? Perhaps tomorrow, or the day after, next month, next year? He'll beg, look at you with these blue eyes of his, and in five minutes she'll be in his arms. And he'll hang around, have a drink, lick his wounds like a cat, and along the way harm another innocent creature, quite unaware, because in two weeks he'll disappear, no one knows where or for how long, and that's supposed to be love? Because she always talks to me about love. Dear Reverend, I beg you, I would prostrate myself if I could, please talk to her, and bring her to her senses! That's such a pity that Wacek had to leave. I promise I'll do everything I can. If she would calm down a bit. And stop thinking about the child. Because she has bad thoughts about it. She doesn't want it. She doesn't know how to love it. Because of that, her belly is hard as a rock. And just to think that any minute she could be in labor. I don't know if God will have mercy on us. He will or he won't, but rather he won't! How dare you, mother? Who gave you the right to talk like this about my life and my love? About the man whom I love, you hear, mother, whom I love! What can you know about love, mother? Have you loved anyone in your life? Have you ever been loved? Always busy with this God of yours, with church gossip, and these morbid afternoons! How dare you? Mother... Have you ever kissed anyone? Embraced anyone? Unconditionally? Wholeheartedly? Have you ever given anyone anything? Some trifle? Just so, without any occasion? Have you ever loved a man? Ever swooned in ecstasy in his arms? Mother! If you have, then who, because it couldn't have been father. Leave. Please leave this room at once. Will anyone have mercy on me? Will anyone have mercy on me? Oh God! My God, my God... Help me... God come to our aid... God help us... Omniscient God omnipresent God... Well.... where is that wonderful God of yours? Before whom you salivate and prostrate yourselves? What sort of love can you give Him since I see you are so miserable, tormented, incapable of the slightest human gesture. You're even afraid of each other's touch. Love... Do you have any idea what that means? Love... I do. I know what love is. 8 March 1979. Jan Buczek Elementary School, Women's Day assembly. Navy-blue first-communion suit. White shirt of synthetic fabric. I'm drenched in sweat. Everything itches. Women's Day, Women's Day, May everyone know, That today we celebrate Girls... I'm singing a song, pretty and clear. Then a poem. Pretty and clear. The prettiest. My brother doesn't sing. He doesn't like it. End of performance. Applause. A woman runs up to me. I can see her. I can see how beautiful she is. She takes me in her arms, and embraces me tight. And tells me that I recite beautifully. And that she loves me best in the world. People. A sea of people. She among them. Gently waving her hand. And then she vanishes from my sight. Every time. Who is it? It's me. My dear, please let me in. Just for a moment. I swear, for just a moment. You always say only a moment, and sit here till dawn. I swear, on Almighty God. Marysia, please... My feet are like two blocks of ice. So tell me. - But only a little. - Tell me about how he came. - You know... - I've told you so many times. About something like that, one could tell endless stories. One last time, please... I came back from the church with my parents. The evening was warm, beautiful. My mom and I sat on the sofa. No, mom sat on the sofa, and I on the floor at her feet. And only my head rested in her lap. And my dad, daddy sat in the armchair. He was smoking a cigar, and reading a book: "Magic in the realm of science." And then we talked about our plans, about our upcoming trip to Africa. To Africa... And then night came and I went to bed. And mom and dad sat by the bedside and were looking at me and holding hands. They had to sit like that, or else I wouldn't sleep. I was afraid to be alone at night. I loved looking at them sitting next to me and holding hands. And we sat like that... quietly... ever so quietly... I don't even know how long. Then suddenly my bedroom door opened ajar and everything was bathed in brightness. Oh my... And once our eyes grew accustomed to the luminosity we saw him standing in the doorway. He entered slowly, very slowly into the room. He stopped by my bed. I was scared at first, but then I was no longer at all afraid. My heart was brimming with delight. But lately there was a miracle. Mother Mary of God, help us. God sent him again. I saw him again. I saw his face. He had no wings but I recognized him. It was him. I know. Jesus, who? Who is he? - I can't tell you. - You must. I beg you, please tell me, or or I won't be able to fall asleep. I can't, I musn't. So why did you start? There must be no God in your heart. Jacob. Reverend Jacob. He is my angel. And he loves me. And I love him. With a great, great love. You'll see. He'll take me away from here. Girl, have you lost your mind? Good cheesecake. I'm telling you, this is the best of cakes. Only it takes a lot of work. My back is sore from all this churning. I don't like cheesecake. Why you look so wasted today? I have a headache. I got up too early, and hardly slept a wink. What did you do this time, Cecilia? Nothing, I just lay there. I tossed and turned. Tall tales! If you were in bed you would have been asleep. When one goes to bed tired, one falls asleep before one can say Amen. I stayed up with Marysia a bit. See! You should have said so in the first place. You're joined to her at the hip. You gobble up her fantastic stories like candy. They're not fantastic but normal. Pretty. Very pretty. About her home, her parents, how they loved each other... Don't laugh so hard, or the cheese will curdle in your stomach. You just wait, you little wench. You'll get slapped with a wet rag before you can blink. They loved each other, loved each other... till they were red in the face. In all that loving, they lost their hearts. I don't know why, but poor Marysia was raised in an orphanage, at the Nazarene Sisters'. Since she was a baby. She never saw her father or mother. They abandoned her. Must have been out of all that love. And you're going to tell me fairy tales. I've known this girl for many years. She was 14 when she came here, with a single dress and holes in her shoes. Pale like parchment. And as soon as she had a decent meal, she threw it up. What, Zofia? What are you saying, Zofia? I'm telling you what I know. And ask anyone you like. A sham. She's just a sham. And then I had that dream. I dreamed it many nights. Very many. I remember exactly although I was just a child. How is it possible? Small children don't remember their dreams. It was night. We all slept in the same room: my parents, Adam... and me. Everyone slept. I could hear their calm regular breathing, but I couldn't sleep. I could feel that besides ourselves there was someone else in the room. It was a woman. She wore a long black robe. I was scared to death. I knew that this woman waited for everyone to fall asleep in order to kidnap me and take me very very far away. I knew I had to fight back somehow, give some sort of a sign, cry, shout... somehow wake up my mother but I was paralyzed with fear. And the woman would take me in her arms and carry me off into darkness. Into utter darkness. My mother had beautiful long hair. Sometimes... Very rarely, she would let me comb it. For five minutes, maybe ten minutes... Only then, when she sat in silence, her eyes closed, and I was allowed to comb her hair, did I ever feel safe. That I belonged to her. It was August. 23 August. Holidays by the lake. The lake. I was standing on the shore. I could see them. Change in weather. I felt I was dying with them. I was dying. I was dead. I musn't be touched. I musn't. We would go there every day. I thought she would extend her arm and pull me within. I waited for it to happen. She didn't take me with her. I was born under the black sun. No... I wasn't born. I was excreted. RUSTLING TREES PUT YOU TO SLEEP. Spewed. AND LEFT MY HEART IN SORROW. She didn't love me. I was a mistake. I am a mistake. I'm a waste of time. Nobody loves me. I shouldn't have been born. Please don't touch me. I musn't be touched. You are not a mistake. I love you. Complaining, sobbing, moaning, with sorrow in my heart I often came to you, my God, to pray to you in the time of need for your help, salvation and solace. Today, my heart filled with joy and comfort, I come to thank you as my Savior, yes, my Lord. You heard my pleas, you uplifted me from on high... Be quiet! Run to the kitchen, get the water boiling, and you fetch clean sheets and towels. Run! Ania... Leave me alone... Leave me alone... - Leave me be... - Ania... It's just me, don't be afraid. It's just my head... I have a terrible headache. But I'll take my pills and it will pass. I want to help you. My darling... It's not your head, it's the child who wants out into the world. No, there is no child, they took the child. I gave the child away, they've taken it. Reverend, help me take her to bed. Hurry up now... And now leave us. Pray to God that this may end well. Quiet, quiet, breathe, breathe. Someone come to me! Somebody come and tell me, I beg you! What's happening?! Pains. She has pains. The child is being born. Our Father who art in heaven... Go to them. Go and promise you'll come back. It's a girl. Beautiful, healthy girl. I'm going to call her Ursula. Beautiful little Ursula. The sun wandered, Smiling, bright, golden, Over the grove, over the meadow, It met a teary-eyed orphan... Everyone should be able to look back at one's memories, and say that he was loved by someone. Loved entirely. To know she was loved for being who she was. Otherwise one's life loses meaning. I feel that one should never be born. It makes no difference how such a person lives his/her life, what they suffer... They will always be able to return to those memories and feel loved. They will be able to love themselves and won't break down. If your memories cannot give you strength you will break down. Stop! Thank you! That was great. Now everyone... As a choir. Kotlarczyk would be pleased. Professor would be delighted. With the support or with life? Subtitles: aileverte for KG, September 2011
