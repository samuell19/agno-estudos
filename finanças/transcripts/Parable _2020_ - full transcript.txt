[dramatic music] [logo whirring] - Probably go back. I don't know if something. [people whispering] [people kissing] [birds chirping] [door opening] - [Dad] Esther, what are you doing? - Nothing. - [Dad] I asked you, what are you two doing? - Nothing. - Answer me, come here, come here. - Ow, ow, - Walk! - Dad. - Just walk. [gentle music] - Hey Zoe, I'm so sorry about what happened yesterday. I hope you're okay. I'm grounded, but whatever, it's fine, I miss you. Hey, sorry I haven't answered your calls. My dad just told me that he wants to send me to a church camp with like other gay kids and stuff. I'm not gonna go, so don't worry. But I just wanted to tell you, he's totally freaked out. - [Dad] Esther. - No signal in this bloody place, So, we're at a petrol station now, and it's probably the last one until I get to this camp that I'm actually going to, it's fine. But they're gonna confiscate my phone so I won't be able to talk to you. It's fine, it's gonna be fine. I love you and I'll see you when all this is over, okay? [knocks on door] - [Dad] Esther? - I'm coming. [car beeping] [door banging] [birds chirping] - Well, so how are the others? - They're fine, beginning to see the light. Thank God it's only the one, might be a lost case. - [Reverend] There's no such a thing. How old is he? - She. - It's a girl? - Esther. She's the first girl to get into the sin bin. - Put a girl in the bin? - I didn't know what else to do. She's very aggressive. I'm sorry. - No need to be, women wanted to be treated equally until they are. Father God, thank you for this day Father God. Father God, please guide us as we ourselves please guide our children, father God. And help us to dispel Satan from them, father God. Your name. [chair whirring] - Esther. - Reverend. Reverend, please, I wanna go home. - And you will when you're better. - But there's nothing wrong with me. - Don't be afraid, Esther. It's for your own good. - What? - Councilor Hahnemann showed me porn Reverend, he put me in a dress, he even threatened to rape me. He said that he'd remind me what my vagina was for. - God gave women the privilege to procreate. Why would you deny such an honor? - Being gay is not a sin reverend, God still loves me. He knows that I'm happy. - Then why are you so upset, why are you crying? - Because I'm tired and scared, and I haven't slept. Please, Reverend. - I'm sorry, but desperate times call for desperate measures. You're not to blame, it's not your fault. - Then let me go. - I will let you go when you let the girl go, demon. - What? - You're not gay, you're possessed. - What? - You are not welcome here demon. - I'm not a demon Reverend, stop. You can't do that, I'm not a demon. - Be quiet demon, this is God's child. [reverend laughing] You can't fool me, demon. [dramatic music] This is God's child. She belongs with the almighty. - Something isn't right, please stop, please stop, please stop. - In the name of the lamb. - Please stop reverend, something is happening. - I order you to leave this child. - Get out, get out, get out. - Stop, stop, stop. - I hate you. [Esther crying] - You don't hate me. You hate yourself. That's why you live in sin. - Get out, get out. Get out, get out, get out. [Esther shouting] [Esther breathing] [Reverend slapping] [Lloyd grunting] - Oh shit, that's creepy. - Yeah. - Yeah, but at least she's getting the landman. - Hi, Lina, cheers Loyd. - Hi, Didi. That's cold. How does it feel knowing you messed that up? - Not now Lina. - Dumb ass. [gentle music] - Ah shit. - Now who's the idiot? - Not again, man Loyd. - It's not my fault we live in a fucking prison. Dude, can you please just buzz me in? I forgot my card. - I cannot do that. - What the, I live here. Come on, I see you every day. We've been through this, man. Come on. - Sir, could you just please sign in my dumbass friend. - Sign in is only for the visitors. - Ah-ha, so you admit I'm a resident. - You could be a murderer or a drug dealer for all I know. - Okay, let's just take... - Please fuck off. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - Can you sign in for me, please? - Yeah, you're literally standing in the way of the Lord. So whatever you gotta do, you better do it quickly. [dramatic music] - Fuck. [speaking in foreign language] - Say the same about you. - Oy, watch it boy. I'm not afraid of kids. - I found it. - Thanks Lina, fuck you. [machine beeping] [gentle music] - Guys I'm telling you, the lizard people, they're real go do your fucking research. That security guard, he's a lizard person. They use these security complexes for their scientific experiments or some shit. - Here we go again. - Loyd, I think all that weed, you smoke is actually turning your brain to shit. No, thank you. I actually have something to do today. - Like what homework? - No, but the trick would probably be a good time to start, Loyd. I'm actually going costume shopping for my party, this weekend, which I stupidly invited both of you to. - Fuck, I'm in. - Let's get wasted. - Is Didi gonna be there? - Yeah, everybody's gonna be there. - Yep, that's a no from me. - Get over your self Kas, people break up. - Not like this. - Shut the fuck up, Loyd. - What does that mean? - Our boy here broke up with Didi because she wouldn't have sex with him. - What, Kas is that true? - Okay, it sounds really bad when you say it like that. - It sounds real shitty the way her friend's tell it. - Wait, what, what do you mean who said what? - Kas what did you do? - Nothing Lina, nothing. [birds chirping] [gentle music] [door banging] - Oh, Reverend. [man laughing] Reverend, hi. - Brother Julian. - Yes. - How are you? - I'm okay, how are you sir? - I'm fine. Julian, can I trust you? - Of course, Reverend. - Good, because your faith is about to be tested. - How can I help? - Open the garage door. [upbeat music] [Kas sighing] [door whirring] [footsteps banging] [objects whirring] [Kas sighing] - Brothers and sisters, I personally invite you to join our growing movement, the Soldiers of Faith. Last year, more than 100,000 men and boys worshipped together. And this year we have opened up the event to our wives and daughters too. Be part of this unstoppable movement as we turn South Africa back to Jesus. May God be with you. [gentle music] [gun banging] - My son. And he's busy not doing his homework. - Hey, this is what you get when you leave your children unsupervised. Where have you been? - I told you I had the church function today. - You still going to that church, huh? - Ah, you're back in your underwear, huh? - They were just on the TV. Reverend Randy's massive gathering in Pretoria. Are you going? - I wish I could, but I have work to do. - Shame, who wouldn't want to be on a weekend away in the middle of nowhere with a cowboy yelling at them? - You can laugh all you want, but just remember, I don't get to take a plus one to heaven one day. And even if I could, it won't be you. Speaking of which, where's Didi? Is she coming for dinner? - No. - Oh. - She's got a thing with her family tonight. - Oh, shame, pity, because I'm making my famous chicken nachos. - Ah, see now that's better parenting. - That girl, a demon. - She's possessed by a demon Julian. And we have been tasked with saving her. But what about her parents? - Her father was the one who brought her to me in the first place. Julian, out of 15 in the camp, 14 have been saved, I can't let this one go. You said you trusted me, do you still? - Of course I do reverend, - I could always get a deacon in the church to help me. - No, no, no, reverend, It's just that, you know about my record, I mean, this feels awful lot like kidnapping. [Reverend laughing] - Those are human laws, Julian, we're in God's country now. You know, Julian, the first time that you came to me, I knew that God had a plan for you. That he wanted me to make a soldier out of you, fighting the darkness side by side. That's why the church let you move in here so that you could get back on your feet again. - And I appreciate that. - Then help me, help me save this lost lamb. A doctor in my congregation got me this. It's completely safe. [zip whirring] [dramatic music] It's legal Julian, they use it in minor surgeries. - I can't take this. - It wouldn't be a true test of your faith if it was easy Julian. - I haven't touched a needle in eight months. - Good, that means you are strong with God. Julian, I've never used this stuff, I don't... I need your help. The doctor marked the syringes so no more than that if we want her calm, not catatonic. - Okay. - Okay. - Aren't you coming? - It's been a rough couple of days, Julian, that beast did its best to break me. I've seen a lot of bad things in my life but I've never seen anything like this. - I can't do this alone. - Just keep her sedated. That way she can't harm herself or you. I need to prepare and rest. [gentle music] You don't have anything to drink, do you? - Only water. - No, I need to fortify my spirits. - I can't keep alcohol in the house. - Ah, yes, of course, go with God. [door whirring] [Esther grunting] [insects chirping] [phone beeping] [Kas sighing] - Fuck. You like that? Yeah I see you. [Kas laughing] [vehicle whirring] - And please, father God, if it be your will, help me to save this girl and help me to protect your flock. And please, father God, use me against the darkness. You prepared me for this, I am ready. And please God, please fortify my mind. Make still my dreams that I may rest tonight before the fight ahead. And please Father God, look after Annie and the girls. And forgive me my sins, Amen. [dramatic music] [skateboard whirring] [gentle music] [insects chirping] - [Kasper] Didi. - Kasper? - No, Kasper, no. - Hold on, take it easy. It's okay. - No, I said no. - It won't hurt, I promise. - Kasper no. - You just need to relax. - No Kasper, No. - Who the fuck are you? - What were you gonna do with her? - Nothing, nothing, I swear. - Nothing, that didn't look like nothing to me. You're one of those guys. - What, no, no, I'm a nice guy. - You're not a good man. I know you. I tasted you. - What? - When I first woke up, with him. Were you with him? - With who? - That God botherer. - I don't know what you're talking about. - And who are you, where are we? - I'm Kasper, we're in the eye of Africa. It's a security estate. Rich people behind high walls and a gate. - So I'm trapped inside this place. Kasper, can you find me? - You're right here. - No, I'm not, but I'm close. I'm in danger. - I don't know what you're talking ab-- - Kasper. Whoa, what are you doing? - Please, you must help me Kasper, won't you help me? - Please Kasper, you must find me. - Kasper, hey, wake up sleepy boy. - Mom, what are you doing? I was still.. - It's time for school. Breakfast is ready and I'm leaving for work. Get up or you'll be late. - Okay, okay, I'll be there in a sec. [birds chirping] [Kas sighing] - All right. [door whirring] - Oh shit. Aren't you afraid of dealing from home? - No, everyone's doing drugs now. It's practically legal. - That's not true Loyd. - Whatever man, tell me about that dream girl of yours. Did you fuck her? - More like she fucked me. I've never had a dream like that. - Ah, dude, I wish I could dream. - You don't dream? - Nope, it's the dope. Didn't you know, dude smoking so much weed, it kills your dreams. Like, I've got no dreams. - Super vivid. More real than real, you know? - Sounds a lot less complicated than your real life relationship. - Loyd, you don't believe the rumors do you? - About the lizard people? Fuck yes, I do. Those motherfuckers are trying to take over the world. - No man. I'm speaking about the rumors about me and Didi. - Oh Kas. - Dude, I didn't hurt her. Okay, we were just a bit drunk and fooling around. - Dude, Kas, whatever happened, happened. - Nothing, nothing happened. I didn't do shit. This whole Me Too man, everyone's looking for a scandal. How am I supposed to lose my virginity if I can't even do anything? - Have you ever thought about being the type of guy that girls want to have sex with? - Like you would know anything about that? - Oh fuck you, dude, I told you about me and Katrina. We hooked up over the.. - What fucking ever, dude, you started that rumor yourself. - And you know there's no smoke without a fire. And this is from a big fat juicy J. - Yo yo, turn that up. - Came to light this morning when the girl's mother contacted the authorities. - Dude, that's her! - That's who? - The dream girl. Center of controversy. There have been previous allegations of misconduct and abuse at these camps. And now claims of gay conversion therapy sessions being held in the dilapidated building behind me. All attempts to contact the self-styled minister have been fruitless. The police have asked that anyone with any information regarding the disappearance of Ester contact them. [gentle music] - She's real. - Real gone, yeah. - What the fuck? - Dude, you probably dreamt about it because you saw her in the news. - How could I, this is new news. - Oh my God, I just got it, dude. - What? - The news. - What about it? - It's the news, dude it's new information, new stuff that we are being fed. New stuff that we need to know, it's news. - Loyd dude, do you know what this means? This girl is real like she exists. And she asked for my help. - She got pretty shitty taste in guys then. - Are you still there? [person breathing] Please, please don't, please. - [Voice] Calm yourself child. - I don't understand. - Who are you? - [Voice] I'm your only friend right now. - Why can't I see you? - You will, when we're ready. Everyone will. - I don't like this. I don't want this, please. - [Voice] There's no one else here for you but me. I can get us out of here but you must stop fighting me. Open yourself up. - What will you do? - [Voice] I will help. - How? - [Voice] We need to get up, I need such chance. - Are you? Are you what he says you are? - [Voice] That man has no idea who I am. - I'm not an evil person. I did nothing wrong. - I know child. [person breathing] [door knocking] - Reverend, I thought you were dead. - Julian, what's the matter, is there trouble? - Not anymore. Well, she's awake and a bit quieter today. - Good. That means we can save the poor girl's soul. - Is everything okay? I mean, should you be drinking in a time like this? - The drinking's not a vice, Julian. It's for protection. She visits me at night, she comes to me in my dreams. The most vile obscenities you can imagine. - I think we need to get some help. We can't take her life into our own hands. Look at her. She looks like we've beaten her half to hell. What is she gonna tell her family? - Julian, be quiet. Your lack of faith is beginning to get on my nerves. Don't you think I know what I'm doing? - I think we should call a real priest. The churches have lost their way, Julian. There's not a single so-called real priest left in this country. Only me, and I'm as real as they get. Now, I need my breakfast. - It's afternoon reverend. - All right then, lunch. [footsteps walking] [object banging] - Holy fucking shit. - Language. - Seriously, are you kidding me? - Your face, dude? - You little shit, mom. I'm calling child services on you. - Oh, my little Kas, come on, the monsters won't hurt you. - I brought some costume options for my party, wearing them was her idea. - You put me up to it. She said you needed a shock to get your head straight. Although I must say you too share fondness for some colorful language. - The word I used was puss clap and I stand by it. - Sounds like you spoke to Didi. - I tried, but she doesn't want to discuss it actually. Says she never wants to think about you ever again. - Sure, that's a bit much. - Kas what happened, just straight up. - Nothing, Lina, really. We argued, we broke up. People get angry during breakups. - Okay, but did you hurt her like hurt? - No, no, is that what she said? - I told you she doesn't wanna talk about it. - Good, she's over it. I'm over it, let's all move on. - So, since we're all over it, does that mean you're coming to my party? - Oh, for fuck sakes Lina. Okay, yes, yes, I'll be at your party. - Cool, just wanted to straighten that out. - Good, because your party is the important thing here, right? - No, Kas. The important thing here is for you to remember that you're not an asshole and to stop acting like such a big one. And if you did fuck up with Didi, then apologize in full and make peace, preferably before my party. Because if you cause a scene at my once in a lifetime big blowout bomb ass party, then you'll get the puss clap that you deserve. That's what I thought, don't be late. [Kas sighing] [door banging] - Okay, okay. - Reverend. - Knock her out Julian, [Esther shouting] the demon's tearing the poor girl apart. - We can't keep on doing this. - Julian, do as I command. [dramatic music] [Esther shouting] - Esther, Esthr, Esther, what are you doing? - Julian, Julian, please, please. You have to stop this. Day is killing me, Julian. I don't think I can take this much longer. - Esther, Esther. Esther, wake up. Please, stop doing this for your own sake. Let the reverend do his work. Let him save you. - He's crazy Julian. I am not possessed. Please, Julian, you have to listen to me. - It's not my choice. You have to convince him that you are cured. He's going to let you go if he believes that you are back to normal. - How Julian, how do I convince him? He made up his mind before he even met me Julian. - I know, I know. It might seem cruel to you now, but Reverend Day, he's a good man, he will save you. - Did he do this to you, Julian, did he tie you up? Did he drug you, beat you with his Bible? - I'm sorry Esther, but this is out of my hands, the reverend will have to decide how to do this, but for now [Julian shouting] [dramatic music] - You die when I wake up. [Esther breathing] [machine whirring] - Here you go. - Thank you very much. - Thank you, have a good day, bye. - Fuck, fuck. [Kas sighing] [cloth whirring] - Any closer and I scream pedophile. - Didi, come on, that's not necessary. - Don't Didi come on me, you piece of shit. - Whoa, just take it easy. Okay, I just came to apologize. Just want to see how you are. - Why? - I know things got outta hand the other night. And I'm sorry, we shouldn't have argued, but we were drunk and fooling around. - You were drunk and high on Loyd's alien mind fuck weed. And you didn't listen when I said no, I said no so many times. Don't fucking shush me. [people chattering] - Okay. - Kasper, what the fuck, man? You were this close to. - Didi, I would never. - I don't wanna hear it, I was there. I know what happened. - Didi, I know I might be an asshole when I'm drunk. - Sober too. - Fine, fine, I deserve that. But, Didi, come on. This is me you're talking to. I would never do anything to hurt you like that. - How would I know? Would you have stopped if I hadn't kicked you in the balls? You know what, I'm not gonna do this. Fuck off or I tell every girl I know that you have a micro penis. - Geez, Didi, my penis is not that small. - Oh, stick around and it will be. Now fuck off. I don't sell ice cream to assholes. [board banging] - Who's an asshole? - He is. Sorry, what do you want, babes? - Slushi please. - Red, blue or mixed? - Blue. [dramatic music] [gentle music] - I thought you were going to help me. - What? - I'm being kept somewhere. - How do I find you? - I don't know, but I'm close. I can feel you. You must come looking. - Just go around yelling your name. It's Esther, right? How can I reward you if you don't set me free? - Okay, am I dreaming again? - Does it matter? I'm here, you're here. If you can find me, you can have me. You can have all of me. The things I would do for my hero are boundless. Wake up. - What? - Wake up. Wake up. [Kas breathing] [upbeat music] - Dude, I'm telling you, there's something really weird going on with this girl in the news. And the dream was just way too real. Even the. - Yeah, that's all terrible, seriously man. Okay, check this out. So I replaced the bong water with poppers. Dude, this shit will blow your mind. - Dude, put that thing down. You'll melt your fucking brain. - That's the point. [door banging] - Who is it? - Jesus, Lina, that's not funny, fuck. - What's wrong with her? - Anyway, dude, I don't even know how to explain this dream. This is the worst dream I've ever had. It was so real. You don't even dream anymore. - The fuck are you? - I'm Ju, I'm John, I live down the road. I'm new to your neighborhood, you know? - Well, it's nice of you to pop in John. - Yeah. I've seen you around. You know, on the estate. - Okay. - Yeah see, man, I was wondering if maybe you could, help me out, you know? - Dude. Yeah, sorry. Of course, what do you need? You saw the sign down there. It says you never have to leave, we got everything. Pool, restaurant, ice cream shack. Fuck there's a graveyard if everything goes to shit. - I need ketamine. - I don't know what you're talking about, officer. - Okay dude, go try the parking lot by the mall. I'm sure you'll find some teenagers to arrest there. - Nah, I'm not a cop. Look, sorry for the misunderstanding. - Okay, is he the worst cop or the worst junkie in the world? - How much do you need? - As much as you have. - Okay, look, I could help you out, but to be honest, it doesn't look like you can afford. Holy shit dog. Of course, man. Like, I didn't realize you was a fellow space cadet. K will cost you but hang on a sec. - Get some needles as well. - I usually charge extra for that, but I think you sorted. Hang one sec. Okay, so how many needles you need? I got one, I'll just give you them all. This is my whole stash. What happened to your ear? - I got bitten by a dog, man. [Lloyd laughing] - No worry dude, it happens to the worst of us. All right, do me a favor. Don't take it all in one please, I can't have that shit on my conscience. - No, it's not for me. Anyways, thank you. God bless. - Yeah, no problem. - God bless you too, man. - Ah, dude, man. You take one look at that freaky fuck and tell me he's not a lizard person. - Since when are you dealing heavy gauge? - I follow the market. - The fucking Ketamine markets? - Dude, if I didn't do this, I'd have to charge you full price on your weed. Besides, now I don't have to work Lina's party. In fact, I might even whip up my batch of Shroom punch. By the way, what are you going as? I was thinking of going as Jacob Zoomer, that dude scares the shit outta me. Or is black face still a thing? - Among racists, yeah. - Whatever, man. I'm rich as fuck now let's get high as fuck. - God, man, get a grip. - What the fuck is wrong with you, man? God. [gentle music] - I got it Reverend. - Good, that's good, Julian, that's good. She's still out. - Well, let me take this. [dog barking] Are you okay reverend? - Secular Media is on another witch hunt. - [Announcer] The search for 18 year old Esther and the lay preacher Randall Day presumed to have taken the girl is still ongoing. An official search warrant has been issued, and a formal investigation is underway. - I had to show you this first because they're after both of us. - Do they know about this house? - I hope not. But you never know, today with hacking and drones. And what not. - I cannot go to jail. I won't be able to see my daughter again. - Don't worry about it. We've just gotta keep one step ahead of them until we can free the girl from the demon. - We need to get her out of here. - We can't free the girl. The demon will deceive the world about what we've done here. God's truth will not be known. - And if they find her in this condition? - They can't find her. They can't. Either we cure her or.. [upbeat music] - Now what? - I need to go pray, Julian. I need to square a few things with the big man. [upbeat music] - You came. - The fur ball and the slime. And you guys dressed, what sort of, what are you you supposed to be, Loyd? - One of them. You look nice, Lina. - Bullshit, I look like a God damn future space pirate Princess. Everything cool with you and Didi? - Yes, yes, yes. Let's not speak about it. Things are still a bit tense, so I'm just gonna keep my mask on. - No nonsense eh? - Aye aye future captain Pirate space princess. - Yeah, yeah. - Don't be mad, but I bought some punch. - Yeah, why would I be mad? - What? - Thank you, just put it in the kitchen. I'll check you guys later. [Lloyd laughing] [people howling] - Dude I can't believe she's so fucking cool with it. - Dude, you just said punch, not psychedelic power soup. - Whatever, it was implied, man. [person laughing] [door slamming] [door banging] - Okay, demon. - Esther, if you're in there. - This is it, the end of the line. - I can't allow them to find you here with me. - If you won't let the girl go. - I can't allow you to wake up. - I'll send you both to the creator. Let him decide who goes where. - I'm sorry. [gentle music] [dramatic music] - What have you done? - I'm sorry. - What have you done? [Esther breathing] - Lina has other friends? - Dude, what the fuck is up with a dead baby? - No idea, but this is some weird shit. - Damn dude. - Optimism, Loyd. - Dude, I think you've got a chance, man. - Think so? - Just go and introduce yourself and tell her about the Lizard people. Chicks love conspiracy theories. - You serious? - Yeah, go. [upbeat music] - Man, fuck that chick, I was watching this documentary about lizard people and they were saying how they don't know how to use human hands. What you need to do is you need to watch the hands. Damn, she's got some human hands. [Esther breathing] - What the fuck did you guys put in the punch? - I told Loyd to speak to you first. He put some shrooms or something in there. Did you drink it? - Do I look like someone who drinks from a cooler box? Everybody's fucking wasted man. Where is that lizard brain imbecile? - I swear, I've studied them for years. If they attack, I can defend myself. - Can somebody please get this guy away from me? He keeps talking about lizards and I can't take it anymore. - What? There are lizard people at this party? - Dude, just chill out. - Great fucking party, right. - Man, everybody's wasted. - Great fucking party. - No you stupid motherfucker, why didn't you tell me you spiked the punch? [upbeat music] - Kas. Okay, this is freaky everybody, not cool. - I thought I was. - Is this like some weird flash mob thing or do you think everybody has mushroom poisoning? Oh fuck do you think Loyd's right about the lizard people? Loyd? - I don't know, I don't know. [dramatic music] - Kas, I'm not cool with any part of this. [doors banging] - What's going on? Who are these people? - [Voice] I found them here, they're lost. Confused, dreaming, but still useful. - For what? - [Voice] To find us. - Kas, I don't think we're dreaming, this shit is real. - How, we don't even know where we are. - [Voice] We're weak but I can bite, you have to give me everything you got. - What the fuck is going on here? - I told you, I've been dreaming like crazy. I think this is one of them. - Look, you keep saying that. But how the fuck am I in your dream? - This looks like the time when Dream Girl came for me. [dramatic music] [Esther whispering] - No. - [Voice whispering] Clear your mind and focus. - What do you want to know friend? This is me, Lina, the real me. - I'm pretty sure I'd know if I'm fucking dreaming. And this is one of them, okay? Put up with enough of your shit in my waking life. - What the fuck, ow. - Did that wake you 'cause I can keep going. [people clapping] - Closer or Further? - Further [upbeat music] - [Voice] They're close now, can you hear? - Yes. Yes, I can hear them. [dog barking] [upbeat music] [Esther breathing] [insects chirping] - I need more power, give me everything you have. [Esther screaming] [upbeat music] [people thudding] - What the hell's going on? - What the fuck are they doing? - I think Ester's in there. I'm going to the front. - They're going to kill someone, some weird zombie apocalypse shit going on. Loyd, Loyd, get the fuck out of here. [Esther shouting] What the fuck are you doing, boy? What are you all doing, huh? Are you on fucking drugs. All of you go home right now. I'm not afraid of murdering kids hey? - Just pull your shit together. - That's it girly. [speaking in foreign language] [person thudding] [people shouting] - Kas, will you come on! - Yeah boy. Get up man. Get up I said man, get over here. Sir, open the door. Open the door. [Esther breathing] - Are they coming for us? - No, but we are coming for them. [stones whirring] - Guys, this cannot be a coincidence, okay? Esther disappears from this weird Jesus camp. And then this preacher man appears in our complex with a mob of shroom zombies at his door. - You say that as if that's some sort of rational explanation for what just happened. - Maybe she's like one of those people who can do shit with their minds, telepathy. - Maybe she's not a people. Maybe she's. - Say one more fucking word. This shit is serious, man. These monsters, they torture queer kids and they make them believe there's something wrong with them. - I know how this sounds, but she came to me in my dreams and asked for my help. And now I know where she is. This is my chance. - Your chance. To what, be a man. Fuck that, call the police. - Fuck the police. - And what if I'm wrong? Don't they arrest people for lying to the cops? - So what do you wanna rescue the damsel in distress all by yourself Kas? - Okay, fine. Let's go check it out first, see what's going on. See if he's there. I mean, after what just happened, there has to be something fucking weird going on there, right? Are you telling me you're not the least but curious? - Curious. No, creeped out very much yes. That's some weird juju voodoo bullshit going on there, man. - Lina, if you were locked up in there, you would wish for someone like you to listen to someone like me right about now. - Okay, but here are the rules. We only go to look, if we see the cowboy, we call the police, okay? If we see anything weird, we call the police. - The police are fucking controlled by the lizard people. - And this fucking space cadet stays. [insects chirping] [stones whirring] - Oh, I don't know, sir. Kids these days have no bloody in respect if you ask me. If it's not drinking and drugs, it's planking and Pokemon. - Well as long as no one got hurt, I don't think it's necessary for us to call the police. - Well, that's fine by me. If the police knew what they were doing, I wouldn't be here. - Right, right. Well, thank you again for your help. You are the hero of the hour, sir. - All in a day's work. Good night, Laurence. I hope everything simmers down. [footsteps walking] [door whirring] - Going somewhere, Julian, or should I call you Judas from now on? - Reverend it's not what-- - So she's turned you against me. - Reverend, I'm not against you. Reverend, please. We cannot go on like this, I cannot go on like this. We're gonna end up killing her or she's gonna kill us, or the police are gonna find us. We have to let her go, make this right. - That's exactly what we're doing, Julian. We are making things right. But I admit this one is going down the line. I don't know if the girl will outlast the demon, but we can't run away from our divine duty. We've gotta keep the cause. - Reverend, I'm not sure that we're still doing the Lord's work. He wouldn't want this. Tonight was a sign. - Tonight was a test. And your faith is lukewarm Julian, you will be spat out for it. - It's not like that, I just don't see how we. - We? There is no we, if you renounce me. - Well then, this is where we part ways Mr. Day. - Ah, I believe we have a small problem. You see, I am Reverend Randall Day, beloved among God's flock. Even more beloved among the God-fearing congregations. And you, Julian, are not beloved by anybody. You are a friendless, jobless junkie whose family don't even wish to know him. - Don't talk to me like that. - You're staying here. You will keep Esther sedated. When I come back we are moving her somewhere safe, somewhere where I can work in peace. - Please, you can't leave me here with her. - I can, and I will. Arrangements have to be made but I will be back. If you can hold your faith until then, I will release you from my service. - Reverend please, she's going to wake up. - If you run, I will come after you with the full force of God's law. My law. Christ may be merciful, but I'm an Old Testament kind of man. [upbeat music] - Okay, cool, we came, we watched it. No cowboy, no abducted girl. Let's just go. - Just hang on. - Reverend, just give me a moment there. We need to talk about this. Come on, man, listen. Listen, you can't leave me here with her alone. - The darkest hour is just before dawn, brother Julian, stand firm. I will be back and I will release you from your burden. - Reverend, please, please, please, please. She wants to kill me. Just go there and just sedate her before you go, please. - I don't have time for this Julian. - Do what you must. - Reverend, Reverend. - Going in for a closer look. - Is that him? - It's him. Where's the cowboy hat? - I don't know, but it's him. - Kas, I don't think that's him then. - It's him. - Yeah, listen, I've got some information about that girl. I think I saw her. [upbeat music] Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I think I know where she is. [vehicle whirring] - Okay. - For real this time, I'm going in. - There's no way it's open. [door whirring] - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No way, you said we're just looking and I didn't see anything. So we're not breaking in. - Guys, we've come this far. Let's go. [gentle music] - That's fucking-- - Sssh! - That's John from the other day. - Is the reverend running a crack house or something? - Maybe it's just like a church halfway house or something. - Fucking go back to step one of the program. - Let's check the back. [Esther shouting] Shit. - What? - It's locked. I'm gonna go and try and find the key. Just wait here. - It's okay, just fucking breathe. [gentle music] [Kas sighs] [object banging] - Shit. [dramatic music] [Esther Shouting] - Oh my God, look. [dramatic music] [person breathing] [dramatic music] [tense music] - Dude, what the fuck is wrong with her? - She's been kidnapped and drugged. - It's okay now Ester, I've got you, I've got you. Fuck. [stabbing sounds] - Julian, I left my hat. - Esther, damn it. Damn it! [dramatic music] Shit. - What the fuck? What the fuck just happened? - What have you done? - What we've done, what do you mean? - You are the maniac who kidnapped her. - Yeah, fuck you, man. - Get back. - Dude, just calm down. We're not looking for trouble. - Who are you? - Please, please sir just put down the weapon. - You have no idea what you've just unleashed. - Fucking Kasper's dream girl? - What do you mean? - Esther, yes, she came to me in my dreams. - Your dreams, so she got to you too. - She just asked for my help man. - Here we are fucking helping. - Helping? You've just condemned us all. That was no girl, that was a demon. - What, dude, demons don't exist. [Reverend laughing] One of the greatest tools in the devil's infernal arsenal is gullibility. What are you doing? Don't you touch that phone? Get it out now, outta your pocket. All of you, cell phones, on the table, you too and you. - Demon or not, that guy just got his shit wrecked. We need to call the cops. - Tell them what? That guy's blood is on all your hands. What do you think the cops are gonna say when they walk in here? They find three teenagers who've just broken into a house and a dead guy lying on the couch. - That's not fair. We have nothing to do with this. - You set her free. And now my trusted disciple is dead. I think it's time that you three joined God's flock. [grass whirring] [birds chirping] [children screaming] [person humming] [dramatic music] [water splashing] [brush whirring] [dramatic music] [water splashing] - What's happening, what are you doing? No, no, no, no. [boy screaming] Oh my God. Anybody, help, help us, help me, anybody. Help! Help! Anybody! Help us! Help us! Please! - The only way to stop her is to drive that demonic spirit back to the lake of fire. - Sir, Mr. Priest, no offense, but I don't believe in... - Reverend Day, are you serious about all of this? - Serious as sin girl. - Then I wanna help you. But I don't know how any of this works. - That's the spirit girl. I pray to God for aid and he sent me you three. It must be Providence. - I don't know if this means anything, but Kasper has a connection with her. - Really, how? - I don't know, she came to me in dreams. Vile and obscene, right? - Yes, full of temptations. Just sinning everywhere. - That's how they work, they tempt the weak willed. - Hey. - You're right. We let her go and we have an obligation. So how can we help you? - Well, first we have to find her. That's if you're willing to help me. - Yes. - Are you with me? - Yes. - Are you with me? - Amen Reverend. - My knuckle. [grass whirring] - Okay, now listen up. She can't have left the estate, so we're gonna split up. Big guy, you with me, you two. - Go, go, go. - No, come back. - You cowards, you snakes of Satan. [dramatic music] - Fuck. [Didi screaming] - I need power, be quiet. [dramatic music] [Didi screaming] [Didi crying] [gentle music] - Sir, stop, please. Stop, stop. I need your help, something terrible has happened. - Show me. - This way. [all panting] - Come on, come on. - Fuck Loyd are you serious? - Fuck, I don't know. - Loyd, where are your parents? I don't know, man, you're fucking buying cigarettes. - Open the fucking door. - Guys, my house is the closest. Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on. [dramatic music] - We finally settled in. Like everything's beautiful. The neighbors came and visit, yeah, they did. It's the best place. I'm so glad. - No. - [woman on phone It's like the safest place. - Who invited you? - She'll say, okay, whoever came to the house, you will love it. People are so friendly. [woman screaming] - It's the drugs reverend. The kids these days are monsters. - Yeah. You know, I'm just terrified they're gonna do it again. And you say they're on. Yeah, afraid so, I've called the cops, they're on their way. But until they get here, you're the only help we have. - Wait here, I have my own gun at the gate. [dramatic music] [Kas screaming] - Your Mom's a fucking lizard person. - It's spreading, we have to stop it. - Let's get outta here. - What about your mother and Didi and everybody else? - What am I supposed to do? I don't know how to kill a fucking demon. - Not gonna destroy my mom. Let's go, let's go, come on, let's go. [Mom screaming] - It's me listen, whatever you hear or see on the television and radio, don't believe it, all right. The girl is possessed, she's done some terrible, terrible things, I'll explain when I get there. I'm on my way. [car whirring] [dramatic music] [Reverend grunting] [grass whirring] [gentle music] [sticks whirring] - Shit, that's the rev's car. We need to open the gate. Loyd, go check if you can find the button inside. It has to be somewhere. - Let's just think about this, are we really fucking bailing? - Yes. - Okay, but what about your mama and Didi and everybody else? - What do you want me to do, Lina? - The right thing Kas. - I'm fucking stressed okay. - Stop fucking around. Okay, go see if we can open the gates, I'll drive. Come on. [upbeat music] - Kas, just wait, just to stop a minute, okay? I know everything's really fucked up right now, but we have to do something, okay? We let her out and we can't just leave. - I don't give a about everyone, okay? I don't want to die. - You're being a fucking asshole. - If being an asshole's what keeps me alive then that's fine by me. - Fuck, sir, there's an huge fuck up, people are dead, I don't know if they're on drugs or something, but they're killing people everywhere's. - He left his keys in here. - Yes sir, no, everything is on lockdown. Nobody's getting out. - I thought the lizard people would get me. Well, I guess there's a demon. - Fuck. [gun banging] [gentle music] Stand back. Come back! - Kas. - Stop! [gun banging] - Kas! - Lina. [gun banging] [insects chirping] [dog barking] [Kas breathing] - Fuck. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] - No. Don't fight me child, I will have my due. We're so close, with these sacrifices, I will have more power than you can possibly imagine, I will make you a goddess. [Esther breathing] - Kas, you fuck, I thought you left me. - We need to get out of here. - God Kas, you need to hurry up. - You! - Get me the fuck out of here, Kas. [Lina breathing] [insects chirping] - Lina. Fuck Loyd. - My hero. - Ester, Esther, please don't do this. - What's a sacrifice without a virgin? - Don't do this to me Ester please, I saved you. - You did get me out of that hole. So I will spare you. Whether she will is another matter. - Didi, please don't do this. - Kas, I promise you, - This is not you, Didi. Don't listen to her, you're a good person. [stabbing noise] - Kas! Didi, please Didi. [Kas breathing heavily] - Now I walk the shadow of the valley of death, I shall fear no evil. - Reverend, you're awake. - Oh God, oh Jesus. - Where was your god when this girl needed saving? - Oh Lord, protect my flock. Let this cup pass Lord. Lord, let it pass. - You invited me, Reverend, come share this cup with me. - Be damned devil woman, back to hell with you. - You created hell on earth and condemned people to it. - Condemned, I'm a shepherd and my flock is an army that marches against the devil. - You should know by now, Reverend, when you go looking for the devil in everything, you're bound to find her eventually. - Esther please, please, if you can hear me, please just listen to me. - Be quiet. - Don't let her do this to you, remember your name's Esther. - Abomination. [dramatic music] - Relax reverend. We have a flock that needs tending.
