That's it, I ain't goin'. C'mon, c'mon, man! I'm fine. C'mon, hey, don't be a wimp, let's go, c'mon! You'll love it. No part of this! Hey, hey, hey, hey, c'mon, c'mon! Don't push me! This is really stupid, man! C'mon, c'mon, stand right up there! That's it, yeah, it ain't the fall that kills ya, it's the sudden stop, c'mon! Don't worry, Mike, wild horses couldn't drag this off. You guys are gonna thank me for this. No, I can't do it. You're all set to go there, Eric. Born to be wild. Mike, are you ready? This is crazy, we're all gonna die! Hey, c'mon down guys, come on down, ho-ho! Yahoo! Woowee, yeah baby! C'mon down, it's fuckin' great! Come on down, woo, yee-ha! The best, the best ever, come on down! You'll love it! Last one down buys the beer! Woo! Hey, what did I tell ya, the best ever? The best, the absolute best, yeah! You fucking did it! The best, the best ever! Yeah, the best, you son of a bitch! Next round's on you guys, OK? You got a death wish, Castle, you know that? A goddamn death wish! What'd I tell you guys, I'm invincible. The word is intoxicated, thank you very much. Just try plain drunk. Fished to the gills! Owned it, great! Shit-faced, bootlicked. Hey, here's to the point of no return, you monkeys! Point of no return! Definitely your type, man. Body, beauty, no brains. Hey, what are you talkin' about? I like a woman with brains. I love a woman with brains! Yeah, name one. My mother. Mom, hey Mom, come back! Don't leave me! I gotta get that girl. You've got a great ass, babe, you know that? You bitch! I'll teach you some manners! Listen, pal, this is none of your business! Dance? Sure. I haven't seen you around here before. Vacationing with my buddies. They needed a break from the Dow Jones. You are a stockbroker? Them, not me, I'm a stunt driver. Stunts? Yeah, I do stunts for movies, car gag's my specialty. Ooh, isn't that like flirting with death? I don't know, I never had the pleasure. Don't forget, we leave at nine a.m. sharp! Did you say 10? Nine, Castle, every time, man, every fuckin' time! So you're, Swedish like the Volvo? No. Swiss like the cheese? No, I'm Norwegian. Liked the smoked salmon? A very beautiful smoked salmon. Well, thank you, I think. Billy, Billy Castle. People call me Angel. I'm not surprised. You're different from the others, aren't you, Billy? What I mean is, you're special. Nah, I'm just the average Joe. No, you attract people. I picked you out of this crowd in a minute. I never said I wasn't lucky. I believe in luck, I believe when you meet someone, you know exactly what's going to happen. Let's get out of here. You live here? Yeah, while I'm in town. It's not exactly home, sweet home, is it? You expecting someone? Actually, I was, you. Me? I watched you going to the bar with your friends, and I was hoping, I'm not very good at meeting people. What exactly do you want, Angel, money? What was that toast you and your friends made? To the point of no return. Yeah, to the point of no return. OK, what do you wanna do, it's 10:30. I knew this would happen, remember Idaho? I remember. I gotta closing this afternoon. There's no way in hell I'm missing it just so Billy Castle can get one more piece of ass! OK, let him find his own way home, we're outta here. This is his truck. Let's go! OK. Hello, hello! Detective Como, I got a couple of questions for this man. I'm Dr. Lucy Flynn, no questions now, Detective. This man's hemorrhaging, he needs an internal examination. He's been out cold for two days. The evidence ain't gettin' any warmer, so why don't you just chill, sister. Now, did anybody else know that you were up there? No one, just the guys I went with, Mike and Eric. How well you know these guys? My best buddies. You sure? Remember somethin'? That's enough, Detective! If you think of somethin', contact Sheriff Webster. This is his office phone number. I'll fax my, report down to him and the statement you gave me in the ambulance. That's all I can do, it's out of my jurisdiction. We'll see ya, good luck. You're a fortunate man, Mr. Castle. Funny, I don't exactly see it that way. You will, people live completely normal lives with one kidney. I doubt you'd be celebrating if some sicko hacked you up. This was no hack job. This was the work of a highly-skilled surgeon, and except for the slight hemorrhaging, and sometimes that happens, I'd call it a flawless nephrectomy. Great, maybe you should hire him onto your staff. Are you all right? Don't worry, I won't hurt you. Look the other way. You can get dressed now. OK, let me see. No smoking. Nice bedside manner. How much do you smoke anyway? Not much, I don't know, a pack or two. Maybe I should consider another doctor. Well, that's up to you. Look, when a person's been victimized, often emotions become suppressed. Feelings of isolation and helplessness. This is all very fascinating, but my problem is physical not emotional, all right? All I'm saying is if you'd like, I can arrange for psychiatric counseling. What I'd like is my fuckin' kidney back. The kidney lives 48 hours outside the body, which means, most likely, it's in somebody else's by now. Why me? Well, it could be your tissue type, it's rare. How would anyone know my tissue type? Well, they wouldn't, not without testing you. The blood work op's quite specific. You ever been sued for paternity? Not yet. Bone marrow test? Any blood work at all in the last year? Just my annual physical for work, I'm a stuntman. OK, well, there's a possibility, if you got hurt and needed a quick change of parts, they'd need to know your type. Then again, it could be as simple as being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Aw, are you OK, sit down. Yeah. It's gonna be tender for a little while, careful. You're gonna have to make some lifestyle changes. Athletics, for one, no running, jumping, climbing, nothing strenuous. Nothing that could cause an injury to your sutures or your existing kidney. How long? I'd say it's a good bet you can safely kiss off the Olympics. Now, I also want you to lay off sugar, caffeine, I want you to cut your intake of protein. It's hard to filter, and, losing the cigarettes would be nice, and absolutely no alcohol. No alcohol? One more thing, you said you were a stuntman? Yeah, I, not that. I'm afraid so, I'm recommending you take a leave of absence from work. Sudden jolts can cause hemorrhaging. Great. I can't eat, drink, or work. Is there anything else I should know about this normal life, Doc? How often do they have to be on these things? Two, three times a week for the rest of their lives, unless, of course, they get another kidney. How do they do that? There's only one way, through OTN, Organ Transplant Network. The candidates are put on a waiting list and they wait. For how long? Sometimes years, maybe never. Hi, sweetie, how are you today? Bridget, this is Billy, Billy, Bridget. Good, just a few more minutes. Be brave, sweetie, OK? I'll see you in a couple of days, OK? Come on. This, this is terrible. Yes, it is. What if they could pay for a kidney? Well, that's illegal. Tell that to the guys who took mine. Look, there's no black market for kidneys or whatever it is you're thinking. You've been through a terrible ordeal, but you're going to be all right! I just, I just wanted you to see that it could be worse, a lot worse. The lab reports show trace amounts of scopolamine in your blood. It's a potent knockout drug, you'll probably feel dizzy for a couple of days until it wears out of your system. Why didn't you tell that to the police? I did, now if you decide to change doctors, notify the hospital, and if not, I'll see you in a week. Dr. Flynn, how's my favorite nephrologist? I'm gonna go check your discharge papers. Doctor. Is she gone? She's gone. That feels so much better. Mr. Castle, I'm Jonathan Cross, head resident here. Nice to meet you. I heard about your unscheduled surgery. I can't pretend to know how you're feeling, but it's got to be like hell. You are in good hands, you know, with Dr. Flynn. Cold hands, you mean. You've gotten to know each other I see. Hey, Doc, Doc, are we almost done in here? I'm freezin' my buns off. You're healthy as a horse, Tom. I'll call when the lab sends in the reports, all right? Cool. If you need to talk, I'm around. Thanks, Doc. OK. Hey, Billy. Hey, Mike. How you doin'? Let's get outta here. Jesus, you scared me half to death! Patty, how'd you get in here? I have the key, remember? Yeah. I brought you some Chinese food. No, I'm not really, I just... Not even an egg roll? No, I just... Lo mein, chow mein, moo goo gai pan? I like it when you talk baby talk. What's wrong? Nothin', nothin'. No, everything, everything's great. It's me, is it me? No, it's, it's not you, it's just, I'm just a little tired, that's all. Tired, you? Yeah, I'm sorry, I just, I don't know, I just, I just don't feel up to it tonight. What are you saying, do you want me to leave? Maybe you should. OK, fine. I'll leave. No! Billy, pick up, I know you're there. It's Patty, listen, I just wanna say I'm sorry about last night. I just thought that if I pretended nothing happened, everything would be all right. Let's just pretend last night didn't happen, and we'll try again soon, OK? Call me, love you, bye. Hey, pal, it's Mike. What, man, I can't keep a lid on this any longer. Everyone's asking about you. You know me, I haven't said a word. Gotta go, call me. Sheriff Webster, please. Sheriff Webster, yeah, it's Billy Castle again. Yeah, I know, I just thought there might be some more news. I told you everything I know. How many times do I gotta tell ya, I don't remember anything else! All right, yeah, thanks. Hey, congrats, Castle, you finally made the front page. Hey, how 'bout lettin' us take a look at that scar? Some other time. Hey, come on, I'll show you mine. I said some other time. Hey, give it a break, he's been through enough. Hey, Christ, what did you lose, a kidney or your sense of humor? Come on, Billy, hey, I just wanna know one thing. Did you at least get laid first? Hey, was she skinny with red hair, that coulda been my old lady, ya know? How you takin' all this, Castle? OK, do you know what they do with the blood tests from the physicals? Not offhand, why? Could you find out for me? Yeah, I can try. Thanks. So how you feelin', I mean, really? Truth is, I can't wait to get back to work. Gotta get my mind off this thing. Well, your doctor called from the hospital. She suggested it would be best if you didn't do any stunts for a while. How long's a while? Three months. Listen, I'm fine. Hey, it's only a suggestion, not an order, but I tend to agree with her. Well, I don't, it's what I do. It's who I am, goddammit. OK, think you can handle a driving stunt? I got a fairly big ramp gag. It's my specialty. OK, job's yours, don't screw it up. Looking good for the ramp, Billy. Hold it steady! Steady! You OK? Yeah, I'm OK. You're cuttin' it a little close, Billy. I'm sorry, I guess I screwed up? Listen, I think maybe your doctor was right. Take a rest for a while, give yourself some time to heal. You had no right to call my boss! You have no right to barge in here! You take the bread off my table. I drive for a living, goddammit! You drove for a living. Listen, you... Go ahead, say it! Nothing. You were gonna call me a bitch? No, I wasn't. Yes, you were. Actually, it was an ironclad bitch. Ironclad bitch? Well, I can live with that. You have blood on your shirt. Let me check your stitches, lay down. When I was behind the wheel, I started losin' it. Yeah, you probably had a panic attack. Shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, general feeling of impending doom. Yeah, all of the above. Yeah, that's not uncommon after a trauma. Yeah, you... Easy, easy! You've torn these. Look, there's a group that meets once a week, Victims of Violent Crimes. I really think you should check it out. Stitches, Doc, stitches? He pulled out the knife. I just lay there, bleeding. He cut off my clothes, and then he raped me, over and over again. Then he cut my throat, tried to kill me. That night changed my life. I was afraid to be alone and afraid of people, which sort of makes this difficult, doesn't it? My friends no longer knew how to act around me, and one by one, they dropped off, including my boyfriend. I made them uncomfortable. I can't blame them, I mean, I, I was uncomfortable. Because of some stranger with a knife, I was no longer the, the friend, the lover, that girl who liked to dance in the park. I was simply a victim, I realize that in this group, and one day at a time, I'm getting myself back. I may never be the person I was before, but hopefully, I'll be a better, stronger one. I'm Cassie, victim of a violent crime. Thank you. To Castle, ace, we missed you, man. Hey, it's good to be back. You been OK with, everything, you know? Yeah, it's all behind me, I've never been better. Really think you should be drinking that much? Hey, it's my life? So how you guys doin'? The usual, market's up, checkbooks up, dicks up. He met a girl. Sounds serious! Yeah, yeah, it could be, it could be. Listen, if you're interested, she's got a friend. Sexy brunette. Hey, don't you think he should stay away from sexy brunettes for a while? By the way, this Mikey just put an offer in on a house. You're kidding, what'd you get, a sudden windfall? Yeah, I got lucky in the market. Well, here's to you, man, congrats. Here's to gettin' lucky. Sorry, Billy, I didn't mean to scare you. We met at Duffy's party last month, I'm Sandy. Hi. You were gonna call me, remember? Don't apologize, you probably lost my number. Look, I'll write it down, give me your hand. Billy, are you OK? Just think if you'd finished the pitcher. I'm going back there. Where? The mountains. Bad idea, Billy, just give it some more time. A month from now, you'll have forgotten all about it. I'll never forget about it, Mike! Don't you see? Someone ripped me open and tore me apart. I'm fuckin' terrorized. Nothing's the same anymore. OK, but what choice do you have? You've gotta get on with your life, man! My life? What life, Mike? I wasn't met to be a victim. I'm not gonna be a victim. You read my report. She's lying, it's the other way around. She took me to that motel room, opened up the door with her own key. Listen, I don't like what happened any better'n you do. This town's famous for it bein' crime-free, but I've known Karen Nordhoff since she was in diapers. Hell, I eat dinner at her folks' every Tuesday. She told me that she met ya, you danced a few, then you took her outside, and you all but passed out, and I got no reason not to believe her. Half the people in that bar told me you were drunk as a skunk. What about the motel room, weren't there any fingerprints? Yeah, there were fingerprints, yours. Look, I just wanna ask her a few questions. Maybe she saw someone follow me. Surely, there's no harm in that! Someone cut me open and butchered me in your town. Look, Sheriff, I'm gonna find out who did this to me. I don't care what it takes! I just don't want it to happen to anyone else! All right. Top of the mountain, Old Elk Road, Karen patrols the bike paths. Thank you. You be nice to her, ya hear? The Nordhoffs are good, upstanding folk. Hey, hey, hey! Why the fuck would you do it to me? Come here, I'll fuck... I had nothing to do with what happened to you, I swear it, but I answered an ad outside the market on a bulletin board, that's it! What ad, what ad? For a pretty type, a model. You're lying, you lied to the police, too! I had to, my father would kill me if he found out I took money for that! For what, for what? For what? To seduce you. Who paid you, how the fuck did you know it was me? I don't know! What about the mot! Tell me the truth or I swear I'll kill you right here! Tell me! The money and the picture were in the a post office box so was the key. The room was prepaid. Whole thing took over the phone to, I didn't, it was a man. He said you were some rich guy who didn't wanna drink alone. I got paid 500 bucks to take you to the hotel room, give you some champagne, and leave, that's it, I swear! What champagne? Expensive stuff in an ice bucket, don't you remember? You drank half a glass and you passed out, and then I left. What about you? I don't drink, and they told me not to. I left, I didn't hear what happened to you until I read it in the paper, I'm sorry! I didn't know that's what they were gonna do. Look, I'll give you the money if that's what you want. You sell champagne? Only place in town that does. Only one kind, top of the line. Only one kind? Funny thing, I hadn't sold a bottle in a dog's age, and now you're the second this month. Wouldn't happen to remember who bought the other one? I ain't likely to forget a hunski a bottle. Somebody called it in over the phone. You're not from the liquor board, are ya? Do I look like it? You look like trouble. Believe me, this town's given me more trouble than anyone deserves. Hey, I know you, you're the boy from the newspaper, the one without the, the bladder. Kidney. Shouldn't happen to a dog what happened to you. Take a piece of beef jerky if you like. Well, what I'd like to know is who bought that other bottle of champagne. Well, let's see. Got 'em a charge receipt here somewhere. You gotta keep phone charges for 60 days. Yeah, here ya go. 100 bucks a bottle, do you believe that? Commercial Bank of Los Angeles? Dr. Armand, Armand Perris. You OK, I'll call a doc! No, no, it's all right. Just, thanks for your help? This shot might make you feel a little woozy. OK? Thanks for seeing me right away. These are deep abrasions. Gravel, tire marks. You been motorcycling? Mountain biking. Lie down. Careful! Yeah. You OK? Yeah, yeah, ooh! Hope it was worth it. Yeah. There's something under the skin here I can, I can feel it. What? You're infecting, I'm gonna have to open this up. So tell me, Doc, what do you got against me, or is it all men? You know it's not healthy hating half the world's population. I realize some of us can be jerks, I mean, I'm livin' proof of that, but we have our good points, too, y'know? I mean, think, what, you don't even like to look in the garage sometimes unless women... Yes! Hoop fan? Yeah. Me, too, I played in high school. Still up for a good one-on-one now and then, do you play? Did, for, for Portland. You're kidding? It was only one season. No, that's great! You know, you look like a pro athlete. Thanks, but, I've been in the, topiary arts for the last year. The what? I trim hedges. I'm Sue, by the way. Daryl. Can I get you a drink. A beer would be great. Sandy, could I have another beer, please. Yeah, sure. Aw, come on, man, yeah! You live around here? Yeah, my TV's got a snowstorm. I got a TV at my place and cold beer. If we leave now, we can catch the fourth quarter. I'll even let you shoot baskets into my trash can. Why not? You live here? My place is being fumigated. You run out of beer? It's, pretty expensive stuff. Special occasion. How often does Portland make the playoffs? Here's to Portland. So tell me, why'd you only play one season. Nothing glamorous, just, Coach didn't like my medical history. Well, what kind of history, sweetie? I have a weak heart. Well, at least you don't have a broken one. What, what is it, sweetie? No, nothing, nothing, nothing. He's under. You said this was gonna be the last one. He's arresting! Dear God! You sleep OK? Is that coffee, you know what I said about coffee. It's decaf. A little present for ya. It was lodged beneath your incision. You're kidding, a contact lens? Yeah, it must've fallen in during the surgery. I could send it to the lab and have 'em check it out. Maybe find a brand name or something. Yeah, sure, nothing else in there I hope. Nah, just your usual blood and guts. Could one doctor do a surgery like mine alone? Doubtful, and certainly not in a motel room. The anesthesia machine weighs 500 pounds. But it is portable. Well, I suppose two people could wheel it in and do the surgery. Two competent people, that's pushing it. What'd the police say? Not much, they're still workin' on it. And so are you against my specific orders to stay put and rest. I'm not used to takin' orders from a woman. I'm your doctor. You're also a very beautiful woman. I guess I shouldn't be noticing that, but, I can't seem to help it. Let me make something very clear. I never, under any circumstances, socialize with a patient. Well, that of the way, thanks for last night. Do me a favor, stop the manhunt, leave that to the police. Doctor's orders? Yes, now, I have to go. Aren't there any tests you can run, fingerprints, hair... As far as I know, you couldn't swallowed that lens playin' kissy face with some broad. You act like I'm the criminal for Christ's sake! Look, Castle, we've been through this! I'm sorry for what happened, but it happened somewhere else. I can't get around jurisdiction, and so far, that's all we got to go on! Well, there's somethin' more. The guy who paid for the champagne, Dr. Armand Perris, his credit card is from a bank here! I wasn't a random victim, he tracked me! So? Well, don't you see, it makes sense. He finds out I have a rare tissue type, and he follows me out there! How'd he get your blood type? I don't know, ask him, he's the doctor! All right, we'll look into it. When? When I got time. How long can it take to find one lousy doctor? He's probably in the goddamn phone book! Well, while you're at it, see if he makes house calls! Now listen, Castle, you still got one good kidney, use it somewhere else! Marv, get this guy outta here after his phone call! May I help you? Yeah, I'm lookin' for Armand Perris. He's expecting you? His office told me he was here. It's about his car. Just a moment please. Mr. Perris, sir, there's a gentleman here to see you. Thank you very much. Are you Dr. Perris? That's right. I oughta kill you motherfuckin' son of a bitch! Playing innocent, Doctor, Get me some help! Or maybe you thought I was dead? I saw your credit card receipt from the mountains. Mountains, young man, my credit cards were, were stolen. I filed a report, check with the police! But you're a doctor? Yes, of English Literature. I'm sorry, I thought. Thank God, this lunatic threatened to kill me. It was a mistake, I, I... There's obviously been a misunderstanding. This gentlemen is my guest. I don't care whose guest he is, I want him out of here now! I'll handle it, Armand, have a drink of me, all right? Shall we? I'm very sorry. It's Mr. Castle, isn't it? Billy, thanks Doctor... Ross, Jonathan. You're looking a lot better, how do you feel? All right. Complications? Not really. Good. I thought Perris was the one who, you know, well, thanks for the help back there anyway. You look as if you could use a drink. No thanks, I'm on the wagon. Yes, of course, how thoughtless. How are you getting along with Lucy Flynn? Better, what's her story anyway? Do yourself a favor and don't try and find out. Sounds like a case of first-hand experience. We were involved for a while when she first came to the hospital. We got our signals crossed. She wanted something permanent, and I didn't. I could have handled things better. I understand, I have a problem with commitment myself. Billy, for what it's worth, I think you oughta let the police handle this. You could be endangering yourself again. What do you mean? You are familiar with multiple-donor situations, aren't you? No. Obviously, you matched someone's blood type, someone rich. If the first kidney doesn't take, they could come back for the second. You know your way out. Well, it's about time, did Detective Como call ya? Is this him? What's goin' on? That's him, a parking attendant saw him. Hey, this is crazy! It's a flat tire, pal, that's destruction of private property. Aw, shit! Can you believe it, a lousy flat tire? Someone steals my guts, and I end up in jail over a flat tire! You shouldn't have done it, Billy. Yeah, I know, hey, thanks for bailin' me out. No problem, I love missing an important client meeting for this. Most guys are obsessed with their dicks, I can handle that, but a kidney, for Christ sakes, it can't even come! When did you get this? It was a demo, I practically stole it. I've been thinking, Billy. I think you should take off, I think you should get away from all this. Take a vacation. Vacation's what got me into this mess. OK, try and island this time, Hawaii, someplace you can relax. I don't wanna relax. I wanna find out who did this to me. You're driving yourself crazy, and I might add alienating every one around you, present company included! Look, I'm your friend, I can tell you things, right? It's getting pretty hard to relate to you, Billy. You don't return calls, you don't go out, you don't talk about anything unless it involves your goddamn witch hunt. The truth of the matter is you're becoming a real pain in the ass. I'm sorry to hear that, Mike. Don't be a jerk, come back, I'll drive you home! I'm Billy. I'm a victim of violent crime. This is what they did to me. Police said they'd never seen anything like what happened to me. Doctors told me I was lucky. I should be just grateful to be alive, that I'm going to live a perfectly normal life. People do just fine with one kidney, some are even born with just one. But goddammit, I wanted that decision to be mine not some maniac with a knife. My buddies keep saying, \"Come on, Castle, \"you're a tough guy, you can deal with it, \" and that's what I've been trying to do. But I can't. I feel like I'm losing control, and I don't know what to do. I'm just losin' it. It was a real surprise to see you show up here last week. I definitely didn't expect you back tonight. How long's it been, two years? Two and a half. It's strange how fate works, isn't it? You get raped and what do I do? Pull a disappearing act, and now here I am, a total mess, and who's at my side helping me through it, you. It's not about fate, Billy. It's about acknowledging our pain, our fear, violation, and learning to be able to trust again. You're great. Thanks. Hey. I drive cars for a living, goddammit! I know cars, and that was no accident! Somebody tried to run me over! You've been in here, what, two, three times already this week? I wouldn't be here at all if you'd do your job! I do what I can, Mr. Castle, the police up north are doing what they can. As for you, you were admitted to the hospital for, anxiety attacks recently, am I correct? You lost your job after losing it behind the wheel. I didn't lose my job, I'm on leave! Then there's your arrest, vandalism to a car. Again with the cars! What, do you got a problem with cars, Mr. Castle? No, I don't have a problem with cars! I got a problem with bein' on someone's hit list, though. You know what I think, I think you're losin' it, Castle. That's what I think, you're losin' it, pal. So now I'm crazy, is that it? I'm crazy 'cause I want some goddamn answers? If you want answers, I don't got none. All right, now get outta here. You OK? Yeah, I'm OK. Ace, are you sure you're OK? Yeah, I'm just, just a little tired, OK? What's this? Organ harvesting, established in third world nations. Little light reading? Listen to this. An alarming increase in black market organ harvesting in India, South America, and the Middle East has become a matter of grave concern to the World Board of Health. In Malaysia, a father of nine traded his youngest daughter's lung for 100 pounds of grain to feed his family during a drought. Man, aren't you depressed enough without reading this shit? Eric, people are desperate enough to sell their organs. You're a stock broker, supply and demand. There are buyers out there. What are you saying? What I'm saying is, if you needed someone's kidney to stay alive, and you couldn't survive two years on a waiting list to get it, where would you go? Some third world country where people can barely feed themselves? Or would you want your new body part to come from someone in perfect health? Someone like me? Shit. This is all too organized. Too set up, someone's runnin' a major business here. I'm gonna put 'em outta business. Did you hear about Mikey? House in escrow, new SL, I don't know. Maybe he was the middleman on your kidney deal. Very funny. Where is all his money comin' from? No, you know Mikey, when it comes to money, he's really tight-lipped. Listen, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go do the course, you up for it? No, you go ahead, I'm just gonna sit here for a while. Don't tell me you want my permission to skydive? Look, someone steals a car. They chop it, the paint it, they retag it, and it's on the street the next day. Who's to say they're not doin' it with organs? You know my opinion on that. There's no black market. Whoever did this was very professional and very organized, but they left one clue. What? Me, I'm the clue, Lucy. There's gotta be somethin', somethin', somethin' medical, something about that operation! You know, that's interesting you should mention that. There was something with your stitches. They were, they were thicker than standard gut. I'll send 'em over to the lab, have 'em analyzed. Maybe they'll come up with something. Great, thanks a lot. Don't mention it. Are you, hungry by any chance? What? I was just wondering if, you wanted to have dinner with me. Technically, I'm not your patient anymore. I'm fine, you said so yourself. I know this great place, it's small, quiet, and great service. Finished? Yes, thank you, it was delicious. Glad you liked it. I have something under my contact. You wear contacts? There, it's OK. What? You wear contacts? Yeah. What's the matter. Billy. Thousands of people wear contacts. Look at this. I like this look, it's good. It's a good... Yeah, yeah, it's very doctorish. Doctorish, well, I guess that's good. So why'd you get into medicine anyway? My mother. She a nephrologist, too? No, she died of, kidney failure. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, me, too. She was on a waiting list, but, there was nothing I could do about it. I just sat there and watched her die. That musta been very painful. Yes, it was. Was or still is? Tell me something. If you found out who did this to you, could you forgive them? There was a time when I wouldn't have, but now, I don't honestly know. Well, I tell you what I know. I think it's high time we get you on a recuperative program. Really? Does that, does that involve kissing? Yes. Kissing is mandatory, that's, that's very therapeutic. How 'bout intense, passionate lovemaking? Yes, that's, that's very healing. Yeah. What's the matter? Someone was here in this house, in this room. What? No, no, sweetie, you're dreaming. It's OK, you're dreaming. - No. There's nobody here. It's just us. It's just us. God! I have to go to work. No, call in sick. No, I can't call in sick. I have to cover for a friend. No! I do, I'm sorry. Hey, are you gonna be OK? Yeah, I'll be OK. You'll be OK. Don't start, don't start! Why, hey! I'll call you later. OK. Dr. Cross! What is it, Billy, what's wrong? Somebody broke into my house and tried to drug me with this! I would say they were trying to kill you. It wouldn't be the first time, where's Lucy? She's not here. You're sure, she's covering for... There are four doctors inside on rotation. They all report to me, check for yourself. Lucy, pick up the phone. You there, it's Billy. Where the hell are ya? Lucy? I'm scared shitless. Did you call the police? Yeah, they said they'd get over here when they could. I got this feeling they think I'm crazy, like, I imagine these things. How'd he break in? Through the kitchen door, and I'm not sure it was a he. How do you mean? I couldn't see, he had a ski mask on. We were wrestlin' a little bit. Keep this with you, even when you sleep, and don't be afraid to use it. I don't need that. Billy, a couple of days ago, you didn't need anything. Keep the mace, you may need it. All right, thanks. Still bother ya? Only every day. You're a wonderful person, Cassie. Not so bad yourself. Thanks for comin' over. Call me if you need me. OK. Hey, look who it is, One Kidney Castle. Hey, you know, I really like doin' your job. How's things goin' with you? Not bad. Hey, show me that scar now. Some other time. No, I said show me that scar. I said no. What's the matter with you, you wuss? You wanna see my scar, Joe? Yeah. Yes, I do. All right, I'm gonna show it to ya, all right? All right. Here, take a look. Can you see it? No, where is it? Right there, can you see it? No, no, I don't see nothin'. Right under there. Now you see it, now you don't. Look, I'm not sure how to put this. I hope you're not here to ask for old job back. We've been doing some hiring since you left, and frankly, we're up to here with drivers. They came for my blood test. Your blood test? From my physical, you said you were gonna check on it for me. Yeah, I remember. Beta Lab, they do all our blood tests. Could anyone else have seen it? Not that I know of, they're confidential. Just a lab and the insurance company. Got any addresses? Yeah, no problem. Thanks, Phil. Yeah, take care of yourself, Billy. Yeah, most of our staff had access to the Stunt Factory files. Let's see, there's Mary, there's Talia, there's Than, and a few others. I need to talk to them. What, all of them? Yeah. OK, come back after hours, and I'll see what I can do. Thanks, Doc. No problem. May I help you? No, I'm all... Excuse me! Hey, hey, come back here! Will you listen to me for a minute. She recognized me, she ran because she'd me before, on my goddamn back with my guts hangin' out. Whoever she's workin' for gets this order for this rare tissue type, Talia dials mine up at the lab and suddenly, I'm the donor! And now that I start getting close, she's dead. Junkies OD all the time. How do you know she was a junkie? She got fired from her hospital job 'cause of drug abuse, she had tracks all over her body like a freakin' railroad. Case closed, Castle, wanna come down to the morgue, kiss her goodbye? You know, you're a real insensitive prick. Thanks. What are you doing here? I think the question of the hour is where were you last night? You weren't at the hospital. Of course I was! I came here lookin' for ya, Lucy! Just tell me where you were, goddammit! I was in the lab half the night getting your stitches analyzed. Yeah, what about your friend, the one you were covering for? Billy, what's going on? Someone broke into my house last night after you left. They tried to kill me with a syringe. Today I went to the lab that did my blood tests, a technician saw me and took off running. I found her an hour later, dead. She used to work here, Lucy, as an OR nurse. Talia Green, ring any bells? No. I don't know any Talia Green. I mean, I did lie to you last night. I didn't, I didn't have to cover for anyone. It's, it's been a long time since I've been with anyone. Since Jonathan Cross? He told you? I just, I needed time to, to think about what was happening. I'm really afraid to get involved again, Billy. There's something you should see. Your sutures aren't standard hospital gut. They're government issue, the kind you find in federal penitentiaries. They're 10 cents a foot cheaper. You think whoever did this to me is some jailhouse doctor? Yep. But if he's such a good surgeon, why is he workin' in a prison? Lousy bedside manner. I've been crosschecking names with penitentiaries. Well, there's nothing we can do until morning. Well, is there, is there somethin' I can do? As a matter of fact, there is. Sorry, I thought you'd be cold. Thanks. Listen, I'm on call today, so if anything earth-shattering happens, I'll letcha know. You promise? Promise. Have a nice day. Scared the hell out of me! Armand Perris went to see Lucy about a month ago, kidney stones. That's what she does, she's a kidney specialist. It was the same day his credit cards were stolen, Billy. I can't believe it... And there's something else. There's a laboratory... Dr. Ross, please report to surgery. I gotta go. Hang on a second, what about... I'll call you. Page Dr. Flynn, it's an emergency. I'm sorry, she's left the hospital. Is there something I can help you with? Lucy, pick up the phone. Are ya there? Pick up the goddamn phone! It's Eric and Mike. Long time, no see, listen, we're down here at Buffalo Chips. There's not one, OK, but three hot chiquitas looking for trouble, we could use your charm, man! Anyway, we'll hold 'em off as long as we can, talk to ya. Billy, it's Jonathan Cross. I'm still at the hospital, it's about Flynn. I think you'd better meet me here, inside the front doors, 10 a.m. Castle, Detective Como. Listen, you better stay put, I just got the autopsy on Talia Green. I was wrong Castle, she didn't OD on junk. It was scopolamine. Billy, it's me. Jesus, what are you doin' here? Listen, about this money I've been makin'. It wasn't a stock. I don't know how to tell you this... What are you saying, Mike? Billy! Say it goddammit, just say it! I just wanted to top you, man. Billy, the money was from my grandmother. She died and left me this cash. I, I wanted you to think that I scored big at work because it's what you would've done. You're always doin' these great things, man! You wanted to top me? My life's a disaster, Mike. No, it isn't. You're always the one that gets the prize! All these years, I've been jealous. Some friend? You're a good friend, Mike. Thanks, Billy. What's going on? It's happened again, Billy. Somebody else has lost a kidney. He went home with a strange girl, woke up in a motel with an IV in his arm. Where is he, I gotta talk to him. He's at home, it's Tom Spikes. You met him when you first came to the hospital, remember? Same physical profile as you, great shape. Well, a few days ago, the lab sent over his, blood work, from his physical. The report also included a test for tissue typing. Billy, I did not make a test for tissue typing. Another doctor requested that, it was Flynn. Jesus, you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Now, Tom hasn't told the police. Hasn't been to the hospital, and he's in bad shape. Why, why would she do it? Who the hell knows. Spikes? Tom? Tom? I don't like this. Where is he? Billy, could you read that, I haven't got my contacts in. I trusted you. What are you talking about? Get away from him, Billy, he's gonna kill you! Lucy, please don't do this. I know Jonathan. I know all about what you did to Billy and Spikes, and God knows how many others! Don't listen to her, Billy. Ask her what she's doing here. How did she know where Spikes lives? I followed you from the hospital. His name is in the records. What records? He works at Terminal Island Prison twice a month. It's a volunteer program, what's that got to do with anything? My stitches were done with supplies issued from a prison hospital. Billy, for God's sake! What about Armand Perris? His credit cards, he was her patient! He belongs to your country club. You could've lifted 'em there. Billy, I swear to you. She's framing me! You and Spikes are the same man, she hates guys like you! I love you, Billy. Could we have made love the way we did if I hated you? Billy, I'm telling you, she's crazy, and she wants to destroy you. What have you done? I didn't mean to! It was you all along! I never meant to kill anyone, Billy. You just couldn't let it go, could you? You ruined everything! Ruined, there are two dead bodies in this house! Give me the gun, Lucy, give it to me! Why couldn't you have been like the others? It didn't have to be like this, let's go. Let's go! For the money, Lucy? That's why you did it, for the fuckin' money? This has nothing to do with money, sit down! You can't play God, Lucy, nobody can. That's not the way I see it, Billy. I take from the rich, and I give to the poor. Your kidney is now pumping away in a woman in Luxembourg. She would've died without it! Just like my mother. So you see? You've made a real contribution. Fuck you and the stupid sermon. Get on with it, shoot me. I don't wanna shoot you. There's a teenage boy in Mexico who needs your other kidney, and they tell me he's very bright, an honors student. Think of the boy, he's only 16 years old. Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt! Looking for something? Naughty boy! It's over, Billy. Where you gonna go? It's over. Easy now. I'd sooner die than let you touch me. No! You bastard! And, action! Go, go, go, get in there! Get in there, get 'im! Get in there! Get in there, get him! You OK, you OK, you all right? Good job, good job, good job, guys. Good job. Woo, hey, you guys. Congratulations. Thanks. That was amazing. What is this, champagne, this stuff gives me nightmares. Are you crazy, Castle, that's champagne! Hey, here's to us! Good friends are hard to find. Cheers!
