[MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [RADIO PLAYING SOFTLY] [BEADS RATTLING] [RADIO PLAYING SOFTLY] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CRIES] [RADIO PLAYING] [CLATTER] [FLAMES CRACKLING] [SCREAMING] -What's wrong? -I had a bad dream. -Ellie, for heaven's sake. -Mr. Mullins, you've got to get this girl out of here. -I've arranged a place for her, nurse. -I didn't ask to come to your crummy house. -I'll stay with her nurse. Please, thank you. Thank you very much. -Why are you keeping me here? I'm not even sick. -It's the only place we could put you up temporarily. -I should have taken off right after the funeral. But it's not too late. -Ellie. You're still a minor. -I've got a father someplace and I'm going to find him. -Of course you have a father. But you don't know who he is. No one knows who he is. Your mother knew, but she's dead. So as far as the court is concerned, you're an orphan. -But as far as I'm concerned, I'm free to do what I want to do. -Ellie, you're under court order. You can't leave the county. -Are you going to stop me? -I'm a social worker, not a policeman. But if you try to leave, I'll have to report it to the Sheriff. -OK, Mr. Mullins. If that's the way you're going to be. -Look, you're an orphan now and-- -I was an orphan the day I was born. Maybe you didn't know my mother. -Yes. I did. -I bet you did. Every drifter and traveling salesman, schoolboy over 16 knew my mother. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR ENGINE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BRAKES SQUEALING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [TRAIN HORN] [TRAIN WHEELS] -Hold it. Hold it. Hold it, don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. Ellie, my name is Calvin Carruthers. You might know me. I used to work at the theater. I used to see an awful lot of you. Every Saturday for the matinee. -How come you chased me? -How come you ran away? -I thought you were somebody else. -Well I drive this road at night quite a bit since I changed jobs. -What's that got to do with me? -Well, with the theater closed, I went to work for the country sheriff. Oh, wait a minute. Hold it. -Mullins told you, didn't he. -Mullins told me you were having nightmares and that you were frightened. Well considering what you went through-- Ellie, I think I'd better take you back to the hospital. Come on. -You sure don't look like any sheriff I ever saw. Where's your uniform? -I'm a detective. -You've sure got a strange way of doing things. How did a man like you ever get to become a detective? -I was an ordinary sheriff's deputy for awhile. Then the detective we had died, but none of the married men wanted the job because of the hours. Well I don't have anybody. The pay is $50 a month extra. -Heaven help the county. -Anyway, I was going over your mother's case. Like to ask you a couple questions, Ellie. -If you were any kind of detective, you'd have checked the report at the coroner's inquest. I told them everything. [CAR ENGINE] -All right. Now you told the coroner that you were asleep in your room. And you ran into the hall. -That's right. -And you saw a man running out of your mother's room. This was all before you noticed that the fire was in the house. -That's right, Calvin. -Did you see a hammer in this man's hand? -No I didn't see a hammer. I only see it in my nightmares. -Ellie. Ellie, did you ever see the man's face. -Yes. It was thick and ugly. A lot like yours. -All right. This big, ugly face. Had you ever seen it before? -He was just another one of mother's clients. Some drifter she picked up at the bar. -Ellie. [BELL RINGING] -Ellie, this is important. This man you saw. Did he see your fave? Did the killer see your face? -I guess he must have. Why? -Only because you're the only witness. He just might come back here looking for you. And not because you have a pretty face. -Are you trying to scare me? -No. But we don't know who the killer is or where he disappeared to. -Well what if you never find him? -I don't know. But until we're through looking for him, you'd better not go any place by yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hi, Calvin. Sorry I'm late. -Yes, Hal Can I get you a beer? -No thanks. You wanted to talk. What's on your mind? -I uh-- what do you and the county Welfare Bureau have in mind for Ellie Masters? -Orphan's home. I'm taking her there tomorrow. -She sure is a pretty little thing, isn't she? -Yeah. -Looks a lot like her mother used to. -Yeah. -Poor Edna Masters. Tell me, Hal. Did you and Edna ever-- -What the hell difference does that make? -Well I doubt that any man in the county didn't. -Including you? -Well not in a long time. Not since she turned professional. And I acquired this. Where is this home you're taking Ellie to? -You know. The old Jameson Deere mansion. -Come on, Hal. What's the matter with you? There's a killer loose. Ellie could be-- -No. Don't get dramatic, Calvin. You're not in a theater now. It's a perfectly safe place. You know Jameson died last year. The widow Deere turned it into a nice home for kids. We made an agreement between her and the county and it's worked out real good for everybody. -I bet it has. -Look, I inspect that house myself twice a year. It's neat as a pin. And the kids are healthy. -Ellie Masters is healthy now. I want to see to it that she remains that way. -Calvin. You're interest in that girl wouldn't go beyond police duty, would it? -Goodnight. -What makes you think she'd ever be interested in you? -I didn't she would or she could. -Then I think you'd better keep your interest where it belongs. -You know, Hal. When you get to be my age and you start thinking seriously about getting married, you start sniffing around for some good breeding stock. -I suggest you do your sniffing in some other pasture, Calvin. -Now assuming that you have a business deal with Mrs. Deere about directing county business her way-- -Now you hold on-- -Which makes no difference to me, Harold. The point is don't give me a lecture. When it comes to Ellie Masters, maybe neither one of us is strictly professional. [DOOR SQUEAKING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLOCK BELLS RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -What are you doing, boy? Sneaking in the house at night, carrying a suitcase? Very suspicious behavior, Ernest. We don't like kids who try to run away from our home. Of course, if you aren't here, the county won't pay us. [SLAP] You get my drift, huh? [SLAP] -Ow. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [THUD] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SLOW MUSIC] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] -You let a 16-year-old boy make a fool of you. -I tell you. He just disappeared. Vanished. He must have made it to the road. -You mean you were too drunk to look for him. -I showed you I came pretty close to grab those. Anyway, it's only the first time one's gotten away. -Harold Mullins is coming here tomorrow with a new girl. He's going to inspect a place while he's here. -Oh, come off it, lady. You got old Mullins in your back pocket. Or should I say under your skirt? -My relationship with Harold Mullins can only be pushed so far. When he counts the children tomorrow, there's going to be one missing. -You talk as if he really doesn't know what's going on here. -Whether he does or not, your boozing has cost me $150 a month. -OK. So you lose money on Ernest. But Mullins is bringing the girl, you see. Tit for tat. -You better set up the infirmary. And you get rid of that suitcase. [MUSIC PLAYING] [METAL CLACKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -It's freezing in here. -Well that's the idea. Get going. We have two more. -Frozen solid. -He'll that out soon enough. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on. Come on. This thing is heavy. I think you and me are going to renegotiate our deal. -Get the others. -I mean it. You get $150 a month for each kid, and all I get is a hernia. -We'll talk about it later. The children will be up soon. Get going. -OK. We'll talk about it later. But just don't forget. I'm the only one who knows about your little secret. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What are you doing, Tom? -I'm working. Go back upstairs, kid. -I want to get something to eat. -I said go back upstairs. -I didn't get enough supper. -If you don't go back upstairs, you'll never eat again. -OK. Don't get mad. -What took you so long? -Uh. I bumped into an old friend. -Go wash the liquor out of your breath. We've got a big day ahead of us. -Quiet, Mrs. Deere. Loud talk frightens the children. -Oh, you are a foolish child, Alice. Trying to run away. Why, Tom could have killed you with that knife. Lucky I got you to the freezer in time. Or you might have bled to death. -Mr. Mullins, you seem awfully anxious to get me to this orphanage. -It's my job. Until you're 21, you're my responsibility. -I got this funny feeling like I used to get sometimes with my mother. Like you;re trying to get rid of me. [CAR ENGINE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL] -So this is Ellie Masters. -Ellie, this is Mrs. Deere. -Hello. -I heard about your mother's tragic-- -Murder? Why? Did you know my mother? -No. But my late husband spoke so highly of her. Tom, here's the new girl. Ellie, this is Tom Kredge, our handyman. -He looks handy, all right. -Ellie, go up and get acquainted. Later we'll get you settled in a room. Something rebellious about that girl. She's going to be trouble. -Oh, you can handle her. You do have a way with children. -Would you like to see the rest of the house, Calvin? -Why not? [BIRDS CHIRPING] -Hi. -Hi. Are you the new girl? -I suppose so. -My name's Bunch. -I'm Ellie. Does Mrs. Deere make everybody work like this? -She says we have to learn to pave our own way in life. -Um, I thought the welfare bureau paid our way. -Well Mrs. Deere says it's not enough to take care of us so she needs the extra income. Oh that's Walter Barnes. He's the oldest boy here. Mrs. Deere's pet. -He looks nice. -He's also my boyfriend. -I think I'll go over there and get acquainted with some of the other kids. -Jennifer tried to run away again. She's been locked in the attic as punishment. I don't suppose you'd want to see her. -Perhaps I'd better not. What I don't know won't hurt me. -Hey, must be pretty tough for you. Suddenly becoming an orphan like that. -Not really. I've got a father some place. -I was born an orphan. I've been in and out of homes all my life. -That girl Bunch seems to be pretty nice. -Yeah. She's a cute kid. -I don't think she'd like to hear you say that. -Why? -That's isn't exactly, you know, the kind of thing a girl likes to hear from a boyfriend. -A boyfriend? You've got to be kidding me. She's only 16. I'm nearly 21. -Poor Bunch. -What do you mean by that? -To be 16 and only a cute kid. -Well the house looks fine, Dorothy, just fine. -I'm glad you're pleased, Harold. Uh, why don't we step into my room and have a nice cup of tea. -Yeah. But first I want to count heads for my report. -Oh, of course. The count. I had the children stay outside so you could inspect. Oh, I almost forgot. We do have three in the infirmary. -Oh, I'm sorry. Nothing serious, I hope. -Just a little cold. -I suppose you'd like to see them. -You know the regulation. -You keep the infirmary locked? -Keeps the other children and the germs in. Shh. They're sleeping, poor dears. Maybe we'll just peek in. We don't want our welfare officer catching anything, do we? -I'll tiptoe. On second thought, I don't want to catch anything. Might be fatal for a man my age. Let's see, there's three in the infirmary. One in the attic. Let's see the others outside. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Now this is serious, Dorothy. You sure you have no idea where this boy Ernest could be? -It's just terrible. No child's ever run away from my home before. -Uh huh. Well maybe I'd better notify the sheriff's office, huh? -If they find him, he won't be sent to reform school, will he? -Wow. How I can do with some employ. -It would be just terrible. I'd lose that income. -No. No, no, no, no, no. I'll do everything I can. -I am so grateful to you, Harold. -You know it's always a real pleasure doing business with you, Dotty. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Is everybody sleeping? Everything in-- My name is Ellie. -What are you doing here. I'm exploring. -Nobody's allowed in the house during inspection. Get out of here. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Goodbye, Ellie. Be good. -Goodbye, Harold. Keep in touch. -I'll do that. -Now we'll take care of you. The girls' rooms are on this side. The boys are over there. -How do you keep them apart? -With strict rule. When you unpack, we'll store your suitcase. Since you won't be needing it. -Who's my roommate? -She's a nice girl. You wouldn't want to-- -Me. -Bunch. This is Ellie Masters. -Sweet 16. -We met. -Well, I see two girls are getting along just fine. Get settled, Ellie. Be down for dinner at 6 o'clock sharp. Latecomers aren't fed. -She's a lovely old bitch, isn't she? Maybe it won't be so bad. You know, Bunch. You and I do have something in common. [PLATES CLATTERING] -Well I say that the police will catch Ernest and probably have him back by morning. Will you pass the rolls, please? -I bet he gets scared and comes back by himself. -Listen to Bunch. Resident psychologist. What do you know about the way a man feels? -Not much but I'm willing to experiment. -This boy Ernest was the first to run away, wasn't he? -Are you kidding? Runaway kids run a regular path between here and the woods. -That's funny. Mr. Mullins said that-- -Don't worry about it. The cops will have Ernest back in the morning. MRS. DEERE: There just aren't enough children to keep the old place going. I know how important it is. The house. The tradition. I just have to cut down. -Those other kids, they must have gotten away? -Yeah. Lucky for them. -Just because they weren't brought back here doesn't mean they weren't caught and maybe send to reform school. -What happened to those three kids in the infirmary? -There hasn't been anybody in the infirmary for over a week. -I heard talking. -It's only a roll. -This is no restaurant. Those rolls have to last three days. I warned you, Pete. Now tomorrow you won't eat at all. As for you, Ellie. Tomorrow will be the beginning of your chores. In this house, you'll earn your way. -You'll start here and work your way down. Polish all the woodwork and the floors. -That'll take a week. -Next week they'll be something else to do. We work hard in our house, Ellie. Chores, classes. -Well when do we get a day off? -Sunday you may do as you please. I can see you're not used to discipline, Ellie. -Oh, I've had my share. -I suppose things are always simpler when you're beautiful. I can remember. Oh yes. I was beautiful once. My husband Jameson thought I was very, very beautiful. And then one morning I looked in the mirror. I was old. And Jameson had found other beautiful women. Women like your mother. -We had a lot of company. -My husband was the only thing in my life that mattered. No children. No friends. Only Jameson. Then-- but that's in the past. Only you young people only concern yourselves with today. -And tomorrow? -Yes, tomorrow. Ellie, I'll do my best to make sure that all your todays and tomorrows are full. And then perhaps one day you too will look in the mirror. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GASP] -Who are you? -Jennifer. I'm thirsty. -How long have you been here? -I don't know. Days. -Why? -I tried to run away. I'm thirsty. [WATER RUNNING] -Where are you going? -I'm taking this to the girl in the attic. -Want to keep her company? -That girl's going to die. -There's only one thing worse than trying to run away, kid. That's seeing things and saying things. You get my drift? -That's ridiculous. -Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to give this place a good going over. -What do you mean, going over? -A search from top to bottom. -Excuse me. Oh, Tom. Tom, come here a minute. Tom, this is Detective Carruthers. Tom Kredge, my handyman. -Yeah, I've seen you around town. -Tom, Mr. Carruthers thinks Ernest might be hiding in the house. -Is that so? -He thinks the house ought to be searched. Uh, didn't you say something about seeing Ernest that night he ran away? -Yeah, that's right. I-- I saw him outside kind of walking towards the road. -Did he have anything with him, like a bundle or a suitcase? -Yeah. A suitcase. -Oh, his belongings are gone. I can show you. -All right. I'd like to see Ellie Masters, Mrs. Deere. -She's in the kitchen. I certainly hope you find her mother's murderer. -So do I. -It's frightening having some maniac walking around loose. -Kredge, let me see your hammer. Yeah. This is a fine tool. You know, I used to be able to with one whack drive a 16 putty nail through a couple of two by fours. -Any carpenter worth his wage can do that. -I guess you're right. Get into town much now, Kredge? -No, not much. -You know Edna Masters, don't you? -Yeah, I know her. So what? -I mean as a carpenter or a customer? -I just saw her around town. She wasn't my type. Her daughter's something else. Bet I could take a crack at that. What the hell's the matter with you? -I don't like that kind of talk. Ellie happens to be a nice girl. -Yeah. Sure she is. That's how you like them, huh, officer? Nice and young. -Well. Appears you've made yourself a home. -Home. You mean work house. -It's like they say in jail. First week is the toughest. -That's a good comparison. What brings you here? -I'm checking out that runway boy Ernest. -Well you're not going to find him. Any more than you'd find any of the others. -What others? -The other kids that ran away. Mr. Mullins tried to tell me that weren't any. I know different. -Uh, Ellie. About your mother. I don't have any leads but I do have some ideas. -What am I supposed to do? Wait around? You going someplace? -Well, anything's better than this concentration camp. -This is the safest place for you. We can keep an eye on you. -Well you haven't exactly been keeping me company. -I've got an awful lot of cases to handle. But I'll be around. -Please. I'm thirsty. -Oh yes Jennifer. I have water. -I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. I promise. -I'm sure you'll never do it again, Jennifer. But you're going to stay in detention. So the other children will learn by your example. You're very fortunate, you know. When Tom caught you, he could've-- -He wanted to kill me. -Tom was very angry at you. It was lucky I was there. I saved your life. And did you say thanks? Well? -Thank you. Thank you. -That was nice. You're important to me, Jennifer. All the children are important to me. Oh, oh yes. The water. It's so cold and clear. And sweet. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I used to dream about a girl strong of wit. There was never anybody. I'm very glad you came, Ellie. -I'm not going to be here for long, Walt. -What do you mean? -I mean I'm going to run away the first chance I get. Will you help me? -I can't help you, Ellie. -You could if you wanted. -You can't run away, Ellie. You wouldn't stand a chance. -Other kids-- -They were boys, Ellie. They could take care of themselves in the woods. Besides it's not really that bad living in a home. -Then you're blind. Jennifer's dying in the attic and that stupid witch is starving to death. -But we get enough to eat. -Walter, I did see three kids in the infirmary the first day I got here. -I told you, Ellie. We were all outside for Mr. Mullins' inspection. Now you're just blowing this all out of shape. And Jennifer, she'll be OK too. Mrs. Deere's a little strict, that's all. -Tom Kredge. He gives me the creeps. -He was a homeless lurch. A starving hobo before Mrs. Deere took him in. Ellie. -I can't stand being cooped up in one place. I never could. Besides, I've got to find my father. -What for? What good's it going to do you, Ellie? -Maybe you've got folks somewhere. Don't you want to know? -Know what? -You've got a mother and you've got a father. You're a little bit of both of them. You can look at them and see what you're going to be. -Maybe it's better not to know. -I've got to. There's got to be something better than my mother. Maybe my father was strong and kind. -Probably just some horny salesman. -You're horrible. -Did you ever stop to think that maybe it's horrible to find out, Ellie? You know, I'm kind of glad I never knew my folks. Because I've got nothing to live up to or down. I'm just me, Ellie. And that's all I care about. -That is all you care about. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [HAMMERING] -Poor Ellie Masters. All cooped up in this old house in the in of nowhere. -It isn't exactly my doing. -Do I get the feeling you want to get away? -Hardly more than all the time. -And now you can. -Can what? -Escape. -Is this part of job, seeing who wants to run? -Of course, if you're not interested-- -Maybe I am. -Meet me in the cellar. -Cellar? -It's where I keep my tools. No one will see us talk there. Here hold this. -No. -Take it so I can get down. -No. -It won't bite. It's just a hammer. Take it. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -Is that you? -What are you doing here? Have you finished your chores? -No ma'am. Not yet. -Why are you dawdling, boy? -Well. You told me once that if I ever saw anything that looked suspicious, that I should come and report it to you. -Well? -Well when I was outside a few minutes ago, I saw something I think you ought to know about. -Oh. How'd you get in here? -I hopped in through a window. I don't want anybody to know we're together. -You'd better tell me what you got in mind. -I'll show you a way to escape. What'll you do for me? -Anything you want. -You promise? -You show me. -A deal. Here it is. A great escape. Whiskey. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CRYING] [SHOUTING] -You'll be punished for this Ellie. Tom, come here. I know what you've been up to. -He tricked me into coming down here. -I'll deal with you later, Ellie. Go to your room. -You know-- -Go. -Nothing really happened. It was-- I caught her around the freezer and-- -You're a liar and a stupid one at that. She doesn't suspect anything about the freezer. You've had your last warning. -You're right, lady, I have. From now on, you keep your mouth shut. -You're fired. Get out of here. -I'm not fired. Matter of fact, you and me just became partners. From now on, I'm in for 50% of the action. -You're in for nothing but trouble if you don't leave my house. -I'll leave here. I'll take our little secret with me. But when I get through, it won't be a secret. -You're not that stupid. You'd implicate yourself. -You're lucky I'm a man who has nothing to lose. Of course, if it's worth having, I've already lost it. You and me. 50 50. You alone, 0. -All right, Tom. If that's the way it has to be. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Please. -Stop your whimpering. -You're a witch. [SLAP] -A crazy witch. [SLAP] -You weren't entirely at fault, Ellie. Otherwise I'd really punish you. -Like Jennifer in the attic? -Jennifer tried to run away and I was advised to punish her. -By who? God? -My husband Jameson always advised me and counseled me. -I thought he was dead. -He's not living but that doesn't mean he's dead. Science is making marvelous progress with drugs and transplants. Someday, people who have passed away before their time will be restored. Like my husband and others. If we preserve their bodies. So you see, Ellie. What you call death may be only the temporary absence of life. -You don't really care if Jennifer lives or dies. -It's so simple when you're young, isn't it? Black and white. Good and bad. Life and death. Youth and beauty. You children are so fortunate. -And you hate us for it, don't you? -On the contrary, Ellie. I'd like to preserve you all. Just as you are. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Walter. -Ellie, I did an awful thing. I was one that told Mrs. Deere that you were in the cellar with Tom Kredge. Why? -I was jealous, I guess. It's pretty dumb, isn't it. Being jealous of Tom. -Yes. Now you can clean up the shed. Hey, I can use this when I run away. The old witch took mine. -Is there anything in it? -Walter, how many girls have you made love to? -Hundreds. -That's what I thought. -What the hell difference does it make? -You get into town once in a while, you could have patronized my mother. -Ellie, for crying out loud. -I knew a lot of her clients. The mailman, the postman, Mr. Samuels the banker. -Ellie, how can you talk about your own mother that way? -Sometimes I'd hear them come in late at night, laughing and giggling. Then later I'd hear them thrashing around and I, I used to lie there in my bed and wonder-- -Wonder what? -Wonder what it would've been like to have had a real father. Not a stepfather. Not a foster father. But a real blood relation. -Maybe it's better not to know. -Mother wouldn't even talk about it. You know she wouldn't-- wouldn't even tell me who he was. The only thing she ever said was that the first man who made love to her got her pregnant. And ruined her figure. But the own feeling that she ever had for me was blame. You know what, maybe you're right. Maybe it is best not to know. -Not to know what? -That you're just some poor accidental bastard that nobody even wanted. -Well. If it isn't the answer to a maiden's prayer. I thought I'd get a little bit of sun before class this afternoon. -I don't think Mrs. D ought to catch you in that outfit. -What makes you so damn good, Walter? -Maybe your age. -Ellie's only a couple years older than I am. Come back in a couple years and we'll talk about it. -Boy, you're dumb. Care to see what she is? -No, Bunch. What is Ellie? -You know. Strange. She's a big tease. Anybody can see that. -All girls tease, Bunch. It's just part of the equipment. Look at you. -I wish your would, Walter. Well? -Yeah. It's all there. MRS. DEERE: I know I shouldn't worry about money. But losing that $150 on Ernest could mean the difference between profit and loss. If we lose another child, it could be the end. And there's the mortgage to pay and the food. So many problems. Money. The children running away. And now Tom Kredge. I suppose I'll have to get rid of him. Just as you say. I so want out of these responsibilities. Oh but, but I am grateful for your help, Jameson. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] -It came from that room. -What happened? -I don't know. I think she had a bad dream. -Ellie, did you have a nightmare? -What's wrong? -I saw the hammer. It was horrible. Horrible. -Horrible what? -Face. -It was a nightmare, of course. -I don't know. It is seemed so real. -Ellie, have you had nightmares since your mother-- -Yes. -Well. That's that. All right girls. Back to bed. There's nothing to do afraid of, Ellie. It was a bad dream, wasn't it? A bad dream. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] -That's all wrong for you. -How do you know what's wrong or right for me? -Look, I do know that that looks like something out of a carnival sideshow. Let me help you. -Will you just leave me alone? I really don't need any of that big sister stuff. -OK. But a girl your age shouldn't be wearing makeup anyway. -Oh yes, a girl my age. You're so mature and wise. -Bunch, why do you hate me? Walter was never interested in you even before I got here. -I'll make him interested. -I'm sure you can make Walter. But you'll never interest him. [SMASH] [SHRIEKS] -All right, ladies. Let's not break anything. -You're a liar in addition to everything else. -Oh look who's talking. Talk about your father Ellie. Talk about your mother. -You don't know anything about yours except that she had four legs and barked. -Cut it out. Ellie, where's my hammer? -How should I know? -You had it in the cellar. -Well then that's where is is. -Only it isn't. -It isn't? I had a dream. I saw a hammer. No wonder it looked so real. It was his. -Now Pete, can you remember what you're supposed to do? -Yeah but what is this? A senior prank? -Just go find Walter and tell him what I told you. -OK. -Then what do you do? -Exactly 10 minutes after Walter gets to the shed, I tell Ellie that Walter want to see her in the shed right away. -Good. Now get going. -OK. -Hey Walter. -Yeah. -Bunch is over at the shed. Says she's got something to show you. -What is it? -You've got to see it to believe it. -Walter, I've decided-- -Ellie. Walter. You and your little slut can have each other. I'm clearing out. -Let her go Walter. -But I think she's going to run away. -Good. -But I don't want her to go. -Mrs. Deere. It's Ellie. You've got to stop her. -Walter, every time I see you, you've got some hot news about Ellie. What is it this time? -She's going to run away. -Who told you? -She did. -Someone tried to kill me last night and I know who. -It was just a dream. -That was no dream. There was a man in my room. -And where is this man now? -I don't know. Maybe he's still in the house. -Stop it. -I'm not staying here to be killed by some maniac. -And where would you go that this maniac you've imagined couldn't find you? -I don't know. Maybe the police. -All right, Ellie. -Mrs. Deere. Mrs. Deere. [KNOCKING] Mrs. Deere. Mrs. Deere please let me out of here. Mrs. Deere. Please, you've got to let me out of here. -I knew that girl was trouble. -Let her run away. To hell with the money. -Suppose she goes to the police with a wild story about a killer hiding in the house. What do you suppose would happen? -We'd have cops all over the place. -There's only one thing to do. Walters knows Ellie wants to go. And by now, all the children know. So nobody's surprised when she shows up absent. -Sure. Just like our friends in the freezer. -I'll keep all the children outside. So you and Ellie won't be disturbed. -OK. What about that welfare guy, Mullins? -Next time he comes, we'll simply show him Ellie Masters in the infirmary. Poor dear. She caught a cold. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR ENGINE] -Old lady, I want to talk to you. -Why Harold, what a surprise. -You can save the crap. You've made a fool out of me. -I don't know what you mean. -You said that Ernest was the only kid that ever ran away from here. -That's right. -But somebody told the police there have been a whole lot of others. -Shh. Harold, the children. -To hell with the children. To hell with you. I've got a job at stake. -Let's talk about it in the house. Uh, no. Let's take a walk. -I don't want to take a walk. Let's go into the house. But this time I want to speak to every single kid. -Why of course, Harold. Whatever you say. -And they'd better all be there. -Certainly. You'll see them all. Every one. -Pete, I think you're full of crap. -I saw it. It happened. -In your mind, you mean. -In the cellar, I mean. He put her in the freezer and he locked it. Bunch, Ellie's going to die in there. -I'm not falling for your corny joke. Go tell it to Mrs. Deere. -Are you kidding? Tom works for her. They're probably in on this together. -What an imagination. -Bunch, y you've got to go to the cellar with me. I'm too scared to go by myself. -That's ridiculous. -Maybe you're scared too. -OK. I'll play your game. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] -There. Do you hear that? -No. I don't hear a thing. -That pounding. You can't hear it? -I don't have time for your dumb jokes, little boy. And you'd better mind your own business. Because you know Mrs. Deere doesn't like us-- -I saw him. -You're just trying to get me in trouble. -Tom. Mr. Mullins doesn't seem to feel we run a proper home here. He wants to inspect again. -From top to bottom. -Be better from bottom to top. -Yes Tom. Good idea. Start with the cellar, Harold. Tom will guide you. -I want to see every nook and cranny in this house. -Oh you will. -And then I want to talk to each child alone. -You may find some of them aren't very talkative. -I'll take that chance. -This way, Mr. Mullins. -What are you doing, Pete? -I was trying to get in there. -You know you're not allowed in the cellar. Now get out of here. Go outside with the other kids. Go on. -Why was he so anxious to break this open? -Beats me. Crazy kid. It's a cold room for meat storage. Let's get going on those nooks and crannies. -Where's Pete? Where's Pete? -Here he comes. Right here. -Where were you? -I want to see the inside of this. -Oh sure. Only I don't have a key. -Then you'd better get it, Kredge. -Sure. You wait right here, Mr. Mullins. -He wants in the freezer. -Then that's where we'll put him. -Come on. Come on. I haven't got forever. -But Harold. That's exactly what you do have. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -Who the hell are you? Whoever you are, you're a dead man. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -Good luck leaving my house. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -Ellie you got out. -She tried to kill me. -See, I wasn't making it up. -She's got the bodies of the kids who tried to run away in the freezer. She murdered them. Look, all of you. Run. Run away. This is your only chance. Run. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on. Let's go. Let's go. -Go where, Pete? [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -You going to leave me in here to die? -Why Tom. You won't die. Not in here. We're just going to chill your blood and stop the bleeding. -Please don't leave me in here. -But Tom. All your friends are here. [SCREAMING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] -No. No, don't kill me. No, please. I don't mean to hurt you. I didn't even know that you were with her. I didn't want to hurt you. Not you. And your face. Calvin. -That's right. Calvin. Last week I found the body of a man near your mother's house. He was burned and his face was smashed to a pulp. It wasn't hard to figure out, Ellie. He was in bed with your mother that night. But you didn't kill him and he managed to crawl away. Oh, you said you never saw the hammer. But I thought it was kind of funny you'd have nightmares about it unless you did. When you learned that a man wasn't found with your mother, you knew he got away. So you decided to pin everything on him. -He was just another one of mother's clients. -I figured you knew you smashed his face in pretty good and you made a fugitive out of him. So you might be afraid he'd be out for revenge. -Back at the house they tried to kill me. -I thought there was something fishy about Mrs. Deere and her house. So I thought I'd do some snooping around. I got the idea I would use you as bait. Scare you into running off to see what they would do. Well I found out. -You're so clever, Calvin. False face and all. -This is nothing but theatrical makeup, that's all. Come on. -What's going to happen to me now? -Well that's up to you, Ellie. You don't think I would want anything to happen to you, do you? -What do you mean? -Well I figured we could become friends. Very good friends. Now that we've gotten to know each other so well. -Don't you want to arrest me? -Arrest you? No, Ellie. I-- I want to marry you. -Marry me? -Yeah. No one would have to know what I know. -You mean you wouldn't say anything? -Not if you're my wife. Wouldn't be loyal. -And if I'm not. -Be a shame to see that pretty little neck in a hangman's noose. -Would they really hang me? -I'd say at least life imprisonment. -No I couldn't stand that. -Well you have a choice. -Calvin, you are corrupt. -Well evil breeds evil, honey. How about it? -Mother always said that older men made the best husbands. -I bet your mother never told you that I was the first one to make love to her. [GIGGLING] [LION ROAR]
