But they were ambushed before they got here. Everybody knows it's suicide to take from us. Someone obviously disagrees. Goddamn it. That just put us right back where we started. How we supposed to build a Mecca without any bricks? We gonna have to take it out of our own bank. We don't have that type of money, Trudy. We only got a few pennies over $2,500. What did he say? - 2,500-- - I heard you. - Wiley. - Yeah. Sure is hot, ain't it? What's up, little man? - You wanna see something? - Yeah. Watch this now. Don't take your eyes off it. Oh, it's still there! Rufus Buck. Look at you. Relic of yesteryear with nothin'. And you think you can roll into my town and take what belong to me? Who the fuck you think I am, huh? Ain't nobody scared of you and ain't nobody runnin'. I'm a sinister motherfucker too. One click of my finger and you disappear. So I suggest you leave… before I finish my steak. And if you even think about sticking-- Come in. What is it, Carson? Sheriff, Mr. Buck wants to see you out front. Tell that man I ain't got nothing to say to him. It wasn't a request. Wiley Escoe. Rufus. You wanna sell this town while I rot in prison? The world you knew is gone. There's a flood comin'. Do you think you can hold onto this place when it hit? At least I know enough to get mine and get out. Kill me… and you'll have nothing.

Now, I ain't gonna kill you, Wiley. You and I were friends once. But know this. Redwood will never be yours, never. Never. Matter of fact, you ain't welcome here no more.

I ain't bringing him in. I'm bringing him down. And we ain't teaming up, old man. Your life's expendable, Marshal. My gang's ain't. Shit, since we're out here, I oughta tell you… I was fixin' to kill you… when you and your fellas brought in Rufus. A lot of men be fixin', son. They always seem to die before they get the job done. Just for the record… I took Rufus in alone. Mary. I figured you'd be halfway to Fort Smith by now. You can put that gun down, Marshal. This ain't a ambush. You, on the other hand, might wanna keep yours handy. Do you think I'm stupid enough to fall for that bullshit y'all pulled in my saloon? I don't want you mixed up in this no more. Then you shoulda told me so. I must confess to some raw feelings myself. This ain't no road to ask a friend to travel. Now you take that money we took off them Crimson Hoods and you buy that ranch you always blabbing about. Hmm? That's mighty generous of you, but that ain't how this gang work.

Either they can't see it or they don't want to. But I believe in what you're doing. This place can be the promised land for us. And as long as that so, ain't nothing I won't do to see it through. You tell them. Citizens of Redwood. A new day is dawning. As by now you have doubtless learned, the territory will officially open up for settlement. Now they say everything we own is gonna stay our own. But you know as well as I do how much that's worth. See, your land, your businesses, your homes has all been promised to the highest bidders by your one-time sheriff, Wiley Escoe. Now, Mr. Buck can prevent this from happening. But in order for us to do that, it's necessary that we levy a tax. At what cost to us? - $50,000. - Ooh. You could scrape every penny from every living soul in this town, and it wouldn't come near to that. You got us between a rock and a hard place. How long you been alive in this country? A rock and a hard place is what we call Monday. I've heard of Rufus Buck. How bad a man he is. But he got himself thrown in jail once before, and I reckon he'll be back there again soon enough. When he is, maybe I'll come back to this town. 'Cause I ain't paying shit. You think I made Redwood for myself? To what end? Redwood ain't a hiding place, 'cause I don't hide. It ain't a dream. I don't dream. You know what it is? It's an example. It's an example… for others to follow. And you… you are an enemy of progress. Please. Please. -I got a family. -What's your name? James. Rest in peace, James. Now, how much? How much can be gathered? Ten thousand. Maybe 15, if every last cent can be squeezed. Mmm-hmm. Ain't nobody leave town until we collect it all. And if you fail to comply, you and everything you love will burn. I ain't got nothin' to rob. But I got somebody to shoot. Step down. Wiley Escoe. Bass Reeves. Fuck. Redwood crawling with gunmen. Rufus came with 12 and took six of mine. Who knows how many he got by now. I don't believe a thing this man sayin'. He a scout. I say we kill him. And we take the rest of them teeth. You ever shot a sheriff, boy? A mayor? Little harder than shootin' regular folk. And I'm both. You both alive and dead 'cause Rufus don't like loose ends. Law don't find a man like Rufus Buck unless you got inside information. Ain't that right, Wiley? If I had my way, you'd be right up under the jail next to Rufus. But you cut yourself a deal, wound up wearing a badge instead. You got your reasons you want Rufus gone, and I got mine. Ain't the enemy of my enemy my friend? Rufus tryin' to save Redwood. But for that, he need money. And that's one thing he ain't have. All right, look here. You made a deal with the Devil. Now he come to collect. You rest up, but be gone before sunup. Or it's gonna go from bad to badder. You hear? Ooh. Marshal. Marshal. Marshal. All them tricks'll get you killed, son. Listen, Marshal. I'm faster than any weapon. You can trust in that. I seen faster. All right. Where? In the mirror. Negro said, "In the mirror." I'm so… I'm sorry.

Every gunhand in the territory's gonna recognize you the second you hop off your horse. Same with Bill and Beckwourth. In case you forgot, your face more famous than all of ours put together, Stagecoach Mary. Got it up on advertisements for that saloon of yours from here to Texas. Which is why I can ride into town in plain sight. Everybody knows I'm buying saloons. Rufus need money. I'ma make him an offer on Trudy Smith's place-- Mary, what in my character makes you think I'll allow that? I'm not asking for your permission. All right. Then I… I guess I'll just be asking you for yours. Since you'll never let a man give you away, I just have to ask you direct. That's the ring my father gave my mother. I was gonna give it to you back in Douglas. But you didn't. I am now. I used to hate feeling helpless over you. Those days are over now.

I hope your proposal rivals your nerve-- Allow me the latitude of completion. My saloon in Douglas is boomin'. Bought me another one in the Elks, and I got a restaurant in Cascade too. For the sum of all that, I could take this one off your hands. The mere mention of my name brings forth good business to any establishment attached, whereas, with all due respect, but the name Rufus Buck instils fear. We know who you are. You walkin' into my town with that proposal is risky. The kind of risk a woman such as yourself wouldn't tie herself to unless there was a whole lot more at stake. See, I don't believe in coincidence, like you just gonna walk in here right after the Crimson Hoods get ambushed with my money. What are you thinking? Oops. You must have forgot whose name is on the door. Another round. We havin' a party, y'all. Come on. All right, Mary. All right. So you still sayin' you don't know nothin' about that money and you done come here alone? That's right. You done rode all the way over here to get yourself killed. And for what? For love? Love is the only thing worth dying for. But you wouldn't know anything about that. You know, I had a sister named Mary. She was pretty, strong-willed, like you. She died of polio when I was 11. Always was in pain, but she'd never let me see her cry. Mmm. There's this girl called Hope lived by us. Big fat kid, always picking on the smaller kids. Obviously out of jealousy. But she ain't never fuck with me though. She hated Mary with a passion, always teasing her about how thin and frail she was. Then one day, Hope walkin' by our house, apple in one hand, blade in the other. She decided to throw the apple across the street at Mary, and it hit my sister in the head and knocked her out of balance. She fell down the steps. Broke her ankle. And now that… that was the first and only time I physically seen my sister cry. And there was Hope standing there laughin' her ugly fuckin' face off. My daddy… he got home, he took off his belt, and he beat me for not protecting my sister. He lashed me until my whole body went numb. Then he went to Hope house to do the same thing to her. When he got there, he saw her whole family standin' on the side of the house, all of 'em screamin' and cryin', and there was Hope… lyin' on the floor in a pool of blood. Somebody had slit her throat. Killed her with her own knife. Daddy was speechless. He ain't said a word to me when he came home. The next day, he sent me to live with my grandparents. And then the next time I seen my sister, she was laying in a coffin. Disease had killed her. I'm sorry your sister had to suffer. I admire her bravery. But you get no words from me. You know, I actually admire your bravery. But I'm afraid the outcome is still the outcome. Hope must die. But not yet. Leave her out here in the street so everybody can see her. No one come to collect her 'fore sunup, put a bullet in her head. Yes, ma'am. Looks like we don't have to wait that long. Whoever die first, right? - Whoever die first. - Mmm-hmm. Get her up. "Whoever die first"? Now, what kind of dumbass saying is that? You two trying to get shot out here? Nat Love. How predictable. You predict my friend Bill Pickett aiming at your bowler cap? You'll be dead before your boys get their aim. And you die right after. But your boss won't see one red cent of that money. My boss? Where is he? Where is who? Marshal. I'm speakin' English, yeah? - Sound like English to me. - Mmm-hmm. Where's Rufus Buck? Oh. Ooh-hoo. Bass. Trudy. If I'd known you were switchin' sides, I'da asked you to come join us. You here for your damsel in distress? You don't look hard of hearing. So I'ma ask you again. Where's Rufus Buck? Well, clearly, you don't know me. Tell your men to go, but you stay, and maybe your damsel will live a little longer. Marshal. Oh. You're pretty though. -Ah, take her ass back in there. -Yes, ma'am. Gonna get me a drink. Hey. That the quick draw I hear tell about, Cherokee Bill? I hear you so fast that your opponents ain't got time to draw before you put two in they back. No, that ain't me. I'm the Cherokee Bill that shoots men in the mouth that talk too much. I'll make it easy for you, then. You draw first. That what you think this is? "Who the quickest draw in the West?" All comes down to who fast and who ain't, right? No, it all comes down to who's alive and who's dead. Trudy, I'm gonna get me something to drink. Good night. Hey, hey, drink, my ass, man. -I practiced that standoff all night. -Jim. - You're not about to walk away. - Get out of here. - No, nobody-- - Get out of here, Jim. - That chicken-- - It ain't the time. Okay. Okay. March, boy. -I said march! -March. Hup, two, three, four. That's enough. They beat you bad? I'ma kill 'em all. You familiar with Napoleon? He said, "I am driven towards an end that I do not know." "As I reach it, as I shall become unnecessary, an atom shall suffice to shatter me." "Until then, all forces of humankind can do nothing to stop me." That's a man who knew exactly who he was. Most importantly, he knew that his time would come to an end. Cut him down. You know why… I gave you that scar? So I'd remember you. No. No, I gave you that scar so I can know your face when you come back to me. Nat Love, the outlaw who robs outlaws, the angel of death who hunts down those who trespass against him with no mercy. I know who you are. And I see the line that you won't cross. See, I know what's on the other side. Apologize for the beating. It was more of an indication for what Ms. Fields might see if we fail to come to terms. What terms? You will return the money you stole from me by Friday noon. Not a moment later. And you will add $10,000 on top of that. We'll call that interest. Somethin' funny? Ooh, shit, how… how you reckon I'ma get that? You're gonna rob a bank. Nat Love is gonna rob a bank. In the meantime, here's a little token of my appreciation in advance. Go ahead, open it. I expect my money on Friday. All of it. You know I can't let you do that. If that money ain't in Rufus' hands in three days, Mary'll die. What bank we talking about anyway? Maysville. Maysville? That's a white town. Yeah, which is why they gonna have $10,000 in their bank. It's crazy. My emotions are all types of confused. I mean, Pickett, I agree. That's crazy. But, Nat, I also agree with you telling the marshal that we gonna do that shit anyways. That's some true outlaw shit. - We outlaws, ain't we? - Ain't no "we," Jim. Not after that shit you pulled in town nearly got us all killed. I had that. Fetch that money you took from the Crimson Hoods. Pickett, kid, you comin' with me. If Rufus Buck want that bank took, why don't he send his own men? This way he clean, see? I gotta go in barefaced as day, a freshly minted bank robber, face up on wanted posters all over the territory. They'll be on you like flies on shit before you open the door. Yep. I said I had to be recognized. Go ahead. Hell no. For Mary. Whoo! Hoo! Close shave. Close fucking shave! I thought I was falling for a fella for a little bit. That's why I didn't say nothing. Well, I ain't the only one. I can't… I can't… It wasn't just me. It wasn't just me. It was just you, Jim. ♪ Follow, follow People they go they follow ♪ ♪ People they know they copy Go all up in my grotto ♪ ♪ They see me like a genie Try to keep me in a bottle ♪ ♪ Petty, petty people Keep them incommunicado ♪ ♪ They tie you up with strings They play niggas like pizzicato ♪ Giddup now. Allow me. What's your real name? Cuffee my real name. Name I was born with? Cathay Williams. You walk worse than you ride, Cathay. Mr. Love, my momma always told me to respect my elders, so I'm not gonna say what I'm thinking. That's all right. I can read your mind. Then I'm sorry you had to hear that. Go ahead. Go ahead, honey. Yes? I'd like to make a withdrawal. Ooh. What… You have to have an account, ma'am. And, well, I'd recommend a bank in Jericho or maybe Redwood for that. Oh. I'm not talking about that kinda withdrawal. I'm talk-- I'm talking about… talking about that kind. Hey, blue eyes. You scared. Your hand is shaking. You'll miss. I won't. Exhale. Attaboy. I ain't like my partner. He don't wanna shoot nobody, but all of a sudden, I'm of a mind to. Now open the fuckin' gate. Think I'm funny now? What you lookin' at? Get all the customers over there. -Get 'em over there! -Okay, okay. -Everyone, please, this way quickly. -You too. Move! Times have changed, ain't they? They say robbing banks is hard work. That's a lie. Robbing banks is easy. The hard part is doing it without killing. So, what'll it be… Mr. Manager? Good man. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Giddyap. Go. Come on, come on. -Pleasure banking with you. -Okay, sir. Nat Love. Don't even look like much. Ain't what it look like. It's what it can buy you. Rufus won't let Mary go once he gets that money. Yeah, I know it. He'll kill her, let me go, so's I carry that hurt with me. So what, we just went through all that trouble for nothin'? Now we got something he want. And that's it? Gonna have to be. You can be all hasty and shoot me now if you want, or you can wait to see what I brought with me first. Ooh. Rufus got stashes like this all across these hills. Enough for a small army. Don't nobody take what I got coming to me. Not even the Devil himself. Rufus Buck is a man. Y'all best reconcile yourselves with that fact.

Nat. Don't miss. Pick up your guns. I know what it is now. It's the eyes. Pick 'em up, I said. Your father, he was a good man? He was. And my mother was a good woman before you cut 'em down. Seems we had a different upbringing. I don't care how you was raised. Now pick up your guns and turn around. I used to watch my father beat my mother to a pulp if she overcooked his food. He cut her up real good if she undercooked it too. One day, I decided to intervene, and he turned his wrath on me. My father was not a good man. Not a good man. He was an outlaw. Robbin' banks… He liked to drink. My mother took a bottle and cut him to protect me. He lashed back at her, and just like that, she was gone. Then, like the coward he is, he took everything we had and left, leaving me with my… my mother. I was ten years old, you know… about the same age you was… when I gave you that scar. I had to fend for myself, but I became who I am, just like you. As I did, all I could ever think about is wanting my father to pay for what he did. I searched for him for years and years, and I could never find him. It's like he disappeared off the face of the earth. I ain't stop though. I kept looking… until I did find him. One day… lo and behold, there he was, my father, a new man. He was clean now. Sober. Man of God. Had a church. He had a pretty little wife. And he had a son, about the age of ten years old, whose eyes blazed like mine. You're lyin'. You're lyin'! Killing our father was retribution, but-- My father! My mother! But it weren't enough. Letting you live, that was the true revenge. Every sin you made, every bank you robbed, everybody you killed. I mean, look at you. You everything he tried to run away from. Buck. Changed his name to "Love." You a Buck. You lyin'. Just like me. Just like him. But you better. You gonna surpass even me because… I couldn't kill my brother. Yet here you are about to kill yours. It's time to take your revenge, Nathaniel Buck. Go on. -Nathaniel Buck. -No. Take your revenge. Nathaniel Buck. Take your goddamn revenge! You a Buck. Nathaniel Buck.
