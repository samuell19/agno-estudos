The delivery's been made. I'll pass the word on. We've been robbed. The money. Where's the money? So … Where's the money? CALIBRE 9 Ugo, what a coincidence. Looking for a cab? I've been in for three years, I'm not wasting my first taste of freedom with you, Rocco. Looking for a car? I'll give you a lift. - I'm not going anywhere. - Then that's where I'll take you. Get in, on my right. You thief. Sit at the right hand of God Almighty. Friends … Nicola, Pasquale … this is Ugo. Ugo Piazza. He used to work with us and he liked it. You like it too. Didn't you like it, Ugo? You liked it, you liked it. He liked it. But he wanted more. Right, Ugo? You know … he stole $300,000 … during a handover. A briefcase full of money. Then you know what he did? Messed up a robbery. He got caught before we got to him. His plan was perfect. He got four years. Then good conduct and a pardon … and here he is. Thief, all right … He got good conduct and got an early release. I didn't take that money. Are you taking me for a fool? You were the last runner. The money was there then it was gone. Did it fly away? Money can't fly. 30,000 ten-dollar bills can't fly away. Do you know what it would look like? A giant money cloud. Rocco, you had them beat me in prison too. I didn't take that money and don't know who did. You did. You took it. Everyone else is dead, it had to be you. And where were you going now? Off on my own. Sure … To get your money, thief. You did a good job hiding it. Three years is a long time. I hope the rats didn't get to it. Good job hiding it. What do you want, Rocco? The American wants you. Why? He wants his 300,000 dollars. You got arrested the same day, you can't have spent it. He wants it right now. If you'd given it back before the trial, he'd forgive you. Well, not forgive. He'd split your head open, break an arm, castrate you … You know what he's like. I know what he's like and he knows what happened. So what do I tell The American? That I won't see him, I have nothing to say. Ugo … there's no way out. No way out. The day you go get the money, we'll be there. The day you buy anything, we'll be there. If you try to leave Milan, we'll kill you. As soon as you set foot on a plane. Search him. The American said not to hurt him. We don't want him to reprimand us, do we? See you later, Ugo. Take care. Let's go. Commissioner, it's Ugo Piazza. - What do I do? - Let him in. Mercuri, watch this. Piazza, just out of jail and already visiting us. You shouldn't have, you could have taken your time. This is Ugo Piazza, a repeat offender. He's a bad fellow but he was pardoned and released. This is my new partner, Deputy Commissioner Mercuri. - Are you here to file a report? - I fell down. From where, Mount Everest? Get him a cognac. These men need assistance when they get out. French cognac for you. They were waiting for you, weren't they? I got hit by a scooter. I lost my I.D. card and my release papers. - What do you want from me? - A temporary I.D. Or I can't get a hotel. Give it to him. Piazza and I go back twenty years. Twenty? Something like that. I work hard to get him behind bars then along comes a pardon and here he is. What are your plans? - To take it easy. - Just like in jail. Now that you know how to get an early release. What's it like in prison? They're all the same, they're terrible. He even complains about it. They're going to close it down. To build a new, healthy, spacious one. A holiday resort. They'll probably send women in, like in Mexico. A psychologist will say it's good for you. You have to be happy in there so when you get out, you're perfectly healthy. I think Italian prisons can be criticised They're in bad shape, the state is taking revenge on the inmates. For example, this talk about pardons … Too many of them. These crooks know what they're doing. Only in a country like this do they forgive so easily. Pardons incite crimes. Tell the truth, Piazza. Were you thinking about a pardon during the robbery? No, about not getting caught. Or how much time you'd get and how much you'd serve? You only worry about pardons once you're in. What about the new law? We can't interrogate anymore, just collect evidence. The magistrate does the interrogating. It's a new policy, it will work. Sure, it depends on the judge. What do magistrates know about people like him? What will he ask him? I know him in and out. How he steals and smokes, if he's smart or stupid. What he wants, how to twist him … People like you don't mess up robberies. And rumours started the day you were arrested. I'd have kicked you out that day. The American's men were after you. But I can help you out. All I want is a temporary I.D. If only they'd got you … one less criminal. And I would have got your murderer. I'll be glad if they kill you. And even more glad if I get your murderer. Do you need any money? I got 30,000 lire in my shoe. - They didn't look there? - No, they didn't. I know about The American's missing 300,000 dollars. We'd close down if it weren't for informers. - What do you mean? - Don't play stupid. You'll pull that money out sooner or later. Let's make a deal. Just you and I, no one else. Mercuri, leave the room. - What kind of deal? - You know. I want The American and he wants you. You need our help. Thanks, but I didn't take that money. Then beat it, you fool. And don't call when it's too late, you know the rules. Wait a second. Who do you think is smarter? You, me or The American? I'm not smart. You're not at all. The American… … maybe. Come here, Mercuri. You're new here. The American's organisation is big. - Do you have any orders? They smuggle money through a lot of hands. I've been breathing down his neck for years but can't get him. I've been studying this thing. I think your investigation is too unilateral. What? They're as organised as the secret service. The runners are given one phone number and it's always a public business. Maybe I haven't explained myself. At every change in the stock market, every bad opportunity, billions of lire go up in smoke. The state is suffering because of it. What's your point? It isn't The American who lays the cards. It's also bankers and businessmen swimming in money. The rich don't care about the country's economy. They send money to Switzerland, Germany, Liechtenstein. So what? In addition to The American, let's go after them too. Mercuri, I get the feeling you don't like the wealthy very much. Mr. Piazza, please. Room 32, give me the keys. Who are you? Nicola, help Grandpa with his crossword puzzle. We'll be right back. Let's start, I'm a genius. If you're not in the mood, I can come back. The American waited until 8:00. Then he had to go out. Oh well, we'll do it tomorrow. The office is in the same place. Now we import electronic calculators. Do you know why we don't just drag you over there? Because he said: "Tell him I want to see him." He didn't say: "Bring him to me." Were you calling Animal Protection Services? I'm here to protect you. Pasquale … look around but remember … Take it easy. Be careful … this stuff isn't mine, yours or even Ugo's. Careful. Do you like this hotel? Is it clean? "4th century Greek philosopher." How many letters? Six. Give me an easier one. "Trigonometric shape." I said easier. Careful or you'll disturb the hotel whores. Be careful. I know you're too smart to hide the money here. How dare you exploit us? I'd understand a bank robbery. But exploiting the American is wrong. I bet you wished The American died while you were in jail. But he's immortal. The abbreviation for Foggia is FG. The great gladiator of Tracia … is Gigi Riva. He's a gladiator, too. Three years in jail and nothing's changed. See, Ugo? You're making a mistake. You have to give the money back. I said to myself: as soon as Ugo realises he's wrong, he'll pull out the money. Unless he's got a plan. If he had a plan to exploit The American, then he's a god. Relax. Do you know what The American always says? Do unto others what they want to do to you … before they do it. The American is always in his office by 9:00. But you can also come at 10:00. Old man, there's a madman in 32, call the asylum. Mr. Piazza is destroying everything. Call the owner, the police, turn him in. I'm talking to you, you old fool. Call the police. Fuck off … Old man, remember this place is a whorehouse. Who is it? What do you want? It's really you. It's been a long time. How are you, Don Vincenzo? What do you expect? Come in. Make yourself comfortable. - How about some coffee? It's already made. I can't go without. You haven't come around. I know. I'm here to talk to Chino. I know, I know. No one comes to visit me anymore. But back then when you worked for me … Ugo, come in here. Excuse me, Don Vincenzo. When I gave orders … You haven't changed. Neither have you. We're not who we were ten years ago. Why have you come? I'm in trouble. Have you heard? I've only heard the rumours But I don't pay much attention. Do you believe it? What does it matter? I didn't take that money. So what? All right. What do you want? What do you think about The American? I know he's an ugly beast. I've never worked for him. He's powerful and dangerous. With influential friends up high and ruthless friends down low. Don't get on his bad side. He's clean too. Never been in the slammer. That means he's hand-in-hand with police, creditors and magistrates. He's been a boss for twenty years. He's very dangerous. I know. But … with you at my side … What do you want, protection? I'm powerless against The American. Do you need a place to hide? Sorry, but I'm not getting involved, it's against the rules. I'm not afraid of them but I'm not getting involved. It's against the rules. I need 100,000 lire to pay the hotel damage. The American's men paid me a visit. I'll give you money. You can always ask me for anything. Except to break the rules. I don't know if you did it. But if you broke the rules they'll make you pay for it. I know the money is not here either. But The American is in his office, and you know him. Always on time, just like a Milanese. He hasn't asked about you yet today. But if he does, I can't say you're not here. You're rich. You owe me 100,000 lire. You're Rocco? If you knew I was Rocco, you wouldn't have done that. When a friend asks for money, I give it to him. You can't walk in my house like that. My name is Chino. OK, Chino. You're right. - Let's go. - I didn't say you could leave. Just like I didn't say you could come in. Give him the money, Rocco. Now you're asking too much, Chino. You can talk about that outside. The American won't like this. Fuck The American. Put it back where it was. You can go now. This isn't over yet. I think you should go see The American. Are you alright, Chino? Tell Rocco I'm coming up with Mr. Piazza. I had you come here because I want you to work with Rocco. No more being a runner. Rocco says you've made powerful friends. Anyone can be bought for 300,000 dollars. Chino only gets 3 million lire to kill someone. Listen up because after today I don't want to see you anymore. Listen to Rocco, we'll treat you right. If you want to see me again, come with 300,000 dollars in tens. Just like it was when you stole it. There's no point joining Don Vincenzo, he's a nobody now. He's a beggar now. His days are over. Behave yourself and do what Rocco tells you. Now go. If you run into Chino … tell him he's gone too far and I want an apology. How are you, Ugo? Fine. I heard you got out. Yesterday. She always asks about you. Get me a drink. Whisky with water, no ice. She'll be off soon. Here you are, Mr. Piazza. Look how much Luca has grown. Ugo's here. Relax. I thought you'd take the first flight to Beirut. How are you, Nelly? Three years older. Does The American know you're out? I'm working for him again. I don't believe it. Well, that's your business. You got out yesterday, what took you so long to come? Answer me. I just found out I'm going to live. Yesterday I wasn't sure. So … What's your situation? Not good, I don't even have a house. I hope you're not leaving already. I'm done for the night. Let's leave together. Yes, they're following us. It doesn't matter, as long as they know where I am. Why did The American hire you back instead of shooting you? To keep an eye on me. As long as he thinks I've got the money, I'm safe. Why are you staying in Milan? - Why don't you go to Beirut? - And do what? Enjoy the money. So you think just like everyone else? You're not going up. There's nothing between us. I told him we might spend the night together. Grin and bear it. You have to accept it. Do you want some disinfectant? Are you sure? I'll be right back. The place looks much nicer than before. Yes, things have changed. It was hard. I was free when you were gone. It was supposed to be easier. But … it was much harder. I was really lonely. I didn't even have you to think about. I'm not asking you for an explanation. You don't owe me one. Three years is a long time for anyone. Can't I have a drink? The usual? Have you got a steady boyfriend? No, they've come and gone. But I've never wanted a steady one. I don't want to have to say goodbye to anyone. But now you're here, you can stay if you want. All I've ever thought about is when I'd get you back. Even though it's been three years, now that you're here … What about the left-wing extremists? Give them a copy of the Constitution. They know it by heart, they always use it against me. Will this be an everyday occurrence? Someone reported hotel damages. You broke mirrors, sofas... etc. - Should I call the madhouse? - I paid the damages. I know, but they won't withdraw the charges. I'll call a lawyer. They'll withdraw the charges in the end. I know, a lot has changed in two days. It's our old friend Piazza again. Here we are. We're friends, aren't we? I'm not your enemy. Don't be clever, this isn't a game. I don't care about The American or his men. The stakes are much higher now. Who orders the money? Who gives money to The American, where does the trafficking start? These things aren't important. Don't be such a pain, do something good. I mind my own business. I heard you're with The American's men again. I don't want to be. - Have you ever seen him? - Once. - How's he doing? - Good, I think. Did you give him the money back? - Did you give it back? - I never had it. What did you say to each other? - I told him the truth. - What about him? - The same old story. - What? - Same old story. - What's the story? He wants the 300,000 dollars. How's it looking for you? Terrible. Let me make you an offer. I'll give you the money. What money? The 300,000 dollars they stole from him. - For what? - To pay The American back. So he kills you and I arrest him. He's worth more than 300,000 dollars. Jokes aside, I could pay you for information. Save your breath. I'm not being an informer. Have you already found a job? - I'm looking for one. - In nightclubs? I know everything about you. You're scrounging off that dancing whore. Get out of here. And remember I'm onto you. Go and be a parasite. Get out of here. You filthy manipulator. Who is it? How can you sleep with that fox at your side? Get to the point. I'd take your place. She's a fox. She's matured with age, got more experience. She didn't waste any time. You're too stupid to talk about women. Talk or I'm hanging up. You're a son of a bitch. You're an idiot and I'm a son of a bitch, so what? I'll show you who's an idiot and who's a son of a bitch. Are you done yet? It's tomorrow. Be careful. Nine o'clock sharp. - Received, confirmed. - I'll call you back. All right, later. He's in. All right. Tell him the gift is ready and at the bar. Is there a package for me? It's for me. - Did your friend get in? - Yes, and he left again. Good. Now make sure it's all there. It was all there. François Durremat. 39, from Lugano. Alfredo Bertolon. 22, from Pieve Veneto. Are you happy? We finally found crooks from the North. This Bertolon has a clean record. Right, he's clean. But he's been stopped three times for student protesting. Three times, he's an anarchist. Everyone's an anarchist to you since those students beat you up. Look at the picture. We know this chap. Right, it's Pasquale. The American's hit man. Imagine tonight's headlines … We could arrest Pasquale. And fill the jail with those deviants. The American has at least 200 runners. Some don't know what they carry, others know and get killed. Or they're killed because they think we've identified them. Like Bertolon. Why don't we act on a larger scale? Come on. Where do I get the men? You're new but you know our team. Let's get the ones who evict people. And who beat up students and workers. There are enough officers for that. Stop being a subversive. People have had enough of strikes and occupations. What people? The so-called "orthodox" ones? You read too much left-wing material. There are people born rich, and people who get rich. Which one are you talking about? Has a rich man ever said: "Let's pay the Southerners better"? Or: "Let's give them better homes"? - The rich don't bother anyone. - Yes they do. What do we have here? Rich people sending money abroad. Of course they're bothersome. This isn't a political rally. There are two kinds of rich people. We're going to fight people who send their money abroad. Unfortunately, there's no red flag here. "Officers, remember property is theft." That's right. We need to remember that property is theft. All we do is provide services to the rich. We are supposed to enforce the laws. All men are equal. Who's equal? Have we ever clubbed a rich man? You think the rich are always right. And the workers, students and Southerners are always wrong. Does anyone want to applaud? I will. You may be right or wrong, I don't know. But this isn't reality. You're from the country where people steal chickens. We're fighting The American, a man with balls. Nice speeches don't work, he can do me in. All you've done is blow smoke. This isn't stuff to talk about at a police station. The American is causing a stir. Bombs in broad daylight. He used to be more subtle. Now he's got a lot of men. Exactly. The more he has, the less they control themselves. He should know that. He's obviously very busy. Listen up, Ugo. Stay away from them, it won't last. Do you know what The American said? He wants an apology from you. I'm not apologising for anything. I used to respect him but now he's out of control. Soon they'll be opening an Anti-Mafia squad in Milan too. Anti-Mafia in Milan? - What's the Mafia got to do with it? - Nothing. It's not them in other places either. They call it the Mafia, but they're just gangs now. Gangs fighting each other. The real Mafia doesn't exist anymore. When drug dealers want to invest their earnings, they build apartment blocks. So the construction gangs kill them. Where's the Mafia in that? The real Mafia is gone. Do you realise you're at a dead end? Your job is dangerous. The police know everything. Why don't you just leave? - No. - Why not? They'd kill me. I have 5 million lire saved, take it and run. As long as you're out of this situation. They'd think I'm spending the 300,000 dollars. They'd come after me. I can't move until they believe I didn't take that money. I didn't join the gang again because I was afraid. But to find out who took it. To be clean again. You think The American stole it. He had a sudden deal and instead of delivering the money, he said you stole it. If that's the case, you'll never prove it. If that's the case … But it might not be. - What do you mean? - What about Rocco? Pasquale, Nicola, or someone else … You expect to find proof after three years? Do you have any clues? Thanks, Luca. That will be all. So if you have no clues … Right, I don't. But to prove it was me, the person will have to compromise somewhere. Then I'll get the advantage. Rotten Italian thieves. We found out who it was. Who? We're going to off him now. Without getting the money? The American doesn't care about the 30 million lire. He wants to teach a lesson. All right, men … and you, Ugo. Come with me. - They're on their way. Get ready. The idiot is telling the son of a bitch to shoot. And you'd better be the first and last. - Shoot. - No, that's Chino. Godfather. So … 300,000 dollars wasn't enough, you wanted more. You're all wrong. Your friend Chino won't get away. We're going to do him in today or tomorrow. And even if he doesn't die, he'll get a life sentence for murder. Chino didn't do anything. Chino is a hit man who kills for 3 million lire. He must be happy, he made 30 million in one shot. But now he's done and you're here. Listen, American. Listen to reason. - I do. - No, you don't. Go ahead and say your last words. Let's hear how you reason. I didn't steal the 300,000 dollars, just like Chino didn't steal the 30 million lire. No one knew the plan. Rocco did. So did Pasquale and Franceschino. Rocco knew. And so did I. Yes, I did. But why do you suspect me? And Chino? Don't confuse the facts, you saw Chino the day before. - You planned it. - Chino is honest. And he doesn't do things like that. The plan hadn't been finalised when he saw Chino. So what? Maybe he called him. I was informed about the plan half an hour before. And I was with Pasquale the whole time. Ask him if I made any calls. He didn't. Maybe you planned it beforehand. At the bowling alley. Did Chino know about your job? I told him. But he doesn't care about other people's business. He's got his own work. Let's hear your story. I see you're being reasonable. OK, it could've been me. But not Chino. He'd never do something like that. Rocco knows as much as I do about the plans. Maybe he had an accomplice. What about Pasquale? But Pasquale wouldn't have killed his own man. That's your call to judge. And out of everyone, only you know who knew the plan and who is good enough to do it, I don't. And what about the German fellow? How do you know he didn't have an accomplice? Maybe he waited for an Italian to steal the briefcase. He's trying to confuse you. It was him and Chino. He's a con, he's trying to screw us all. Look, American. There's one more thing I'd like to say. Say it. I didn't take the 300,000 dollars. I wasn't the only one who could've done the job. Not that job or this one. My sweet boy. What do I do with all this money? I have to go. Get Don Vincenzo's body and have it buried. - Do it in three days. - I will. The cemetery plot has already been paid for. Have a nice marble tombstone made. Any connection between the bowling alley death and the old man? The bowling-alley chap was German and belonged to The American's gang. We've known about him for years. How do you know? He's new in our records. We only know his name was Vincenzo. You said the bowling-alley chap was killed … - … by the one they just killed. - Well, I was wrong. What was the shoot-out like? Very intense. The number of shells proves it. You can't prove anything. They kill each other and we're playing with bullet shells. What about the other man? The blind man? An old man who happened to be walking by. We can't identify him because he had no I.D. on him. So far, no one's reported him missing. Was he homeless? No, his clothes were clean. Mercuri. It's our prized democratic public servant. He got promoted and transferred. Congratulate him. - Do you want to talk? - Yes, just for a second. I'll be right back. I know I owe my transfer to you. An immediate office transfer, Commissioner Mercuri. It doesn't matter if I'm here or down south. As long as I do my duty. I have no doubt you will. There are no rich people or people like The American down south. Can I say something without hurting your feelings? It's hard to hurt my feelings. Go on. You're an old policeman. Just a few years older than me but a very old mentality. And unsuitable for your position. Feel the need to insult me? Oh well, my old mentality is staying here, while your modern one is going south to herd sheep. Does it sound like fun? I'm not trying to insult you. I just have two things to say. Make it quick because I haven't had my coffee yet. The American is an effect and not a cause. All criminals are an effect. - Are you listening? - Yes, I'm listening. - Do you understand? - No, but continue anyway. The American and the criminals from the South are an effect that means that … the herds of Southerners coming to live up North do the most menial jobs, the ones no one else will do. They're badly paid, bad housing and no social benefits. No wonder they turn to crime. That's enough, I get the point. People are born criminals. Now go where you've been sent. Send a nice postcard. The American wants you. Do you think Chino will make a deal with Rocco? Rocco won't even make it in the house. We spread the word that we want to negotiate. - Chino won't negotiate. - Why wouldn't he? Rocco killed his godfather and tried to kill him. Scram. He's cheap. We've been here three hours. That bastard will never come. It's Chino. You finally got me to kill The American. Come down to the station. Why? Shoot-out at The American's villa. - I was out of town. - I know, I saw you. It's just a formality. And you don't have a licence to drive. Call the station, we've got Piazza. The witnesses can identify him. I'll put your bag back here. I can't tell you what happened. It's confidential. A mass murder. But the commissioner is happy. You're leaving your bag in here? Who'd steal a bag in front of the police station? Cut the crap and let's go. POLICE HEADQUARTERS Piazza's here. Have a seat. We can hold him because he was driving without a license. Good. Ladies, this is Piazza. Was he at the villa? Was he or not? There were so many of them. And you said they all died. He's alive, isn't he? We've already told you we just got there and started hearing shots. One of you said someone took off in a car. I said I thought I heard a car after the shots. Maybe someone was driving by. We ran into the house when the shooting started. We locked ourselves in the loo. Too bad you didn't fall in. Ugo, I tip my hat to you. Your plan was absolutely infallible. Why don't we work together? You'll be the boss. I don't mean the 300,000 dollars. You earned that. It's yours. I mean I respect you. Quiet. They're like two dogs without an owner. Piazza, you can leave. You were out of town. Rocco, you stay here. You have to prove you were playing pool. Leave, Piazza. I'll consider your offer. Where do you think you're going? You can't leave town without permission. Where can we find you? At Nelly Bordon's, Via Sant'Antonio, 18. So you live there. Keep on scrounging, parasite. Start packing, we're leaving. All right. He's on his way. Get ready, Luca. Rocco is going to Nelly's house. What happened? You said you weren't coming today. Where are we going? Beirut. Shoot him. Shoot him, Luca. You can't back-stab someone like Ugo Piazza. You'd better not even touch someone like Ugo Piazza. Don't even go near someone like Ugo Piazza. When you see someone like Ugo Piazza, you'd better tip your hat. Tip your hat.
