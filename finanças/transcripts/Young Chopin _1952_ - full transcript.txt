Presents a film of 1951 production THE YOUTH OF CHOPIN based on short stories by Written and Directed by In Cooperation with Dialogue Lines by Music Editor Cinematography Cameraman Set Designer In Cooperation with, Consultation Costume Designer Sound Recording Production Manager Cast Of Characters Music Performed by Hey, is this Prince Jablonowski's palace? Not the Sultan's, of course. Drive up closer! Lullaby, sweet Jesus, pearl very precious, Lullaby, sweet Jesus, sleep now, hush your cries. What a dreamy beauty he possesses. If I didn't know the family, I'd swear he has the bluest blood in his veins. Skarbeks' tutor first, his father is a lyceum professor now. No wonder the son is so well-mannered. Is it true, Your Excellency, that His Imperial Majesty has departed this world? Who dares spread such rumours? Why do you, Prince, turn to me? Who may know better than the Secret Delegate Novosiltsov? A latent drunk rather. Don't I know what they call me in Warsaw? Be honest, Excellency, don't you pity His Imperial Majesty? No. No order has been sent to pity him. What if the news of his passing is true and Russian conspirators start a revolution? The Russians: Rileyev, Muraviev and Pestel demand a clear answer what a future government we imagine. We'll continue as a constitutional monarchy. They don't want to get rid of the czarist tyranny, only to enthrone a Polish king. Some of them are Republicans. A Republic? And then to abolish the serfdom of peasants, as Lelewel would have it, dreaming of a Jacobinic overthrow. That would spell the end of nobility, the most splendid Polish estate. Should we, of our own will, be guillotined by an overthrow? On the contrary. We must not let the conspirators to move too far to push our pitiful Republicans and demagogues to the fore. At least this is my task in the conspiracy. Muraviev demands an answer if the Poles will rise once the Russians start a revolution against the czar. Exactly. Major Lunin is waiting with vital news to talk to the Central Committee. The major is trustworthy. We can talk to him. Czar Alexander has died. A revolution in Petersburg. - Is that sure? - Absolutely. Poland has only two roads to take now: To rise against the new czar along with the revolution, or to remain in slavery. Alexander's successor will forgive neither Russians or Poles, depriving you and us of everything: freedom, land, and all property. Been looking for you everywhere, Prince. Once you're with us, you suddenly disappear. You're too much intrigued by His Majesty and the developments in the empire in general. - I know nothing about a revolution. - What revolution do you mean? Where the hell have you found out?! Your Excellency seems to forget you're my guest. And you, Your Highness, may be mine tomorrow... behind the walls of the Carmelites. You're risking your name and estate. You're playing a losing hand. We've already suppressed the Petersburg revolution - and now it's... - Go ahead, Your Excellency. In this game, as you call it, we're partners on the same side of the table. A revolution in Poland deprives you of power, me - of my nobility, peasants and the land my family has possessed for centuries. I know about it and you shouldn't forget it, Monsieur... Halt! Whom are you driving? This is Prince Jablonowski's carriage. We're taking the prince's guest home. By the order of the Police Chief we check who's riding. I'm Fr?d?ric Chopin. Auburn hair... elongated face... long nose... - A long nose. - K?chelbecker! Stop feigning, K?chelbecker. You're wanted for mutiny against His Imperial Majesty. What are you hiding there? I didn't want them to freeze, but my name is Chopin. Chopin? When speaking, K?chelbecker twists his mouth. Age 30... I'm sorry. We have to check. Didn't I tell you: our Prince's guest. Drive on, stupid. There're many such today who say one thing but keep plotting mutinies on the side. Gee up! Who's there? Open up to let a lost soul in. Who is it? In plain words. A rebel. Bless my soul. Zuzka, it's me. Open the door. - What me? - Fr?d?ric. God knows. Rebels have no entry. All right, Zuzka. It's me. I don't know you. Godspeed. Are you crazy, girl?! It's me... Fr?d?ric... Hello. May I have the honour of offering my respects to my dearest mother? Was the young lady polite and didn't cough? That's what you taught me. Do I bow well? - Where's dad? - Entertaining guests, - Prof. Linde and Prof. Eisner. - Eisner? How did they like your piano at the Prince's? Can you imagine? Gendarmes stopped the prince's carriage bringing me, looking for one K?chelbecker, a rebel. - K?chelbecker? - They're downright crazy! So they'll soon look for rebels at the university, or even in my music school. Which Prof. Bentkowski will explain in his lectures as being in line with human development. World history has shown that the class differences in a community stem from the nature of things. The lower class, rabble, throughout the times, in all nations is not reason-oriented, but driven by emotions... Have you heard? Across the river, the Russian poet K?chelbecker was caught yesterday. A conspirator against the czar, he had to flee once the Petersburg revolution was suppressed. K?chelbecker? They were looking for him, as I was returning from the Prince. The Russian rebels are said to have had their men in Konstanty's Warsaw regiments. Major Lunin is said to have been arrested and Jablonowski has turned in Castellan Soltyk and Colonel Pradzynski. The prince has turned traitor? Please tell me if the French Revolution was before or after Jesus was born. Well? Before, Sir! Merriment doesn't bespeak a knowledge of world history. Yes, please... I'm talking to you. Approach the lectern! Sir, that's how I was admonished in lower grades in school. Prof. Lelewel treats us quite differently. What? Lelewel? Is this a lesson in manners?! Boor! Mind your language! We won't suffer an insult from anyone. Silence! I'll teach you to forget your asinine jokes. Silence! Someone from the board of education! Quick! Has Magnuszewski come to see you? - No. - Where can he be? At the choir rehearsal, perhaps. What happened? I was with Wolowski when they came to arrest him. They found secret diaries of Kilinski on him. - And? - Barcikiewicz had him - detained at the Carmelites. - Barcikiewicz. Don't you know our judges want to appear as fervently conformist as can be? Let's warn Magnuszewski. They might arrest him after the row at the lecture. A handful of Poles were marching home, to their native grounds. As soon as the folks glimpsed the white-and-red banners, Tell Magnuszewski Wolowski has been jailed. The town thundered with joyous shouts: Wolowski was arrested for refusing to be insulted! To the judge's apartment! Let's go! Police! Police! You'll catch a cold... my heavenly weakling... Where does this road lead? Where to? Marymont's textile mill, to get a job. Up there straightaway to Marymont. The general results in theory of music, counterpoint and composition from the grammatical, rhetorical and aesthetic angles, first year Fr?d?ric Chopin - special ability, and second year Ignacy Dobrzynski - extraordinary ability. - Fr?d?ric! - Fr?d?ric! Fr?d?ric. Is he away? Why so down in the dumps? Because rather than you, Eisner distinguished Dobrzynski? Look, he wants to write his well-rounded phrases for the whole orchestra. Yet what can I juxtapose? One poor piano? I'm sick and tired of hearing that no one has yet composed great things for the piano alone. - Have you heard Dobrzynski's scherzo? - Yes. It's nothing. Well-rounded and smooth like a... Well-rounded and smooth, like a... say it. Whereas all music greats say that scherzo should be just a joke and nothing else. But can't a joke feature tragic overtones, like in Shakespeare. Don't the comic and tragic intertwine in life? Let Dobrzynski blare with all orchestras in the world. He doesn't have a word or a note of truth. I like Zuzka's simple folk song a hundred times better. She always eavesdrops while I play. I can't teach her not to. Not true. All I wanted was to dust off the door. Come, sing us that song Hey, don't walk around the cart... Sing it, darn it! Don't you walk around the wagon, Don't you walk around the axle, Don't give the boy a kiss no matter how he pleads. Don't you give the boy a kiss, no matter how he pleads. Look, let's sing it in a caf?. Dobrzynski may be there. All the literary and musical stuffed shirts will be furious. Don't you walk around the wagon, Don't you walk around the axle, Don't you give the boy a kiss no matter how he pleads. Romantic music to the rescue. Come here, Chopin! That's it! Mr. Chopin has hit the nail on the head. This is the new art you Romantics fight for. Don't you give the boy a kiss Are you paying attention, gentlemen? No matter how he pleads. Yes, Sir. We prefer the simple and bawdy folk song to your romances by Mme de Genlis and Mme Cottin... - Our Mickiewicz... - We read French novels, as our mother tongue is unable to render the delicate feeling of love play. Don't you agree, Romantics, that your friend Mickiewicz has a gift? Why then does he look for folk tales to piece together his poems for female cooks? Mickiewicz - for female cooks, and Polish songs - Fr?d?ric - for cart drivers? Maybe just for the nation that you don't see, the one that's rising from the commoners? Nation! Rabble! Mr. Lelewel, for God's sake, why this politics in literary discussions? The scholar and the poet must be fully convinced they have been created for the community. Why this conviction? Literature is good taste. Music is temperance and a higher notion of harmony. I don't find them in folk jingles. Let Mr. Mickiwicz be a provincial bard, but not here in Warsaw. They judge differently in the world. Here's Moscow's 'Telegraph', which writes - let me translate for you - "The readers will find here the news of a new beautiful turn in Polish poetry, about Adam Mickiewicz, whom all of Poland is reading with admiration..." "This young poet deserves European fame, thanks to his poems full of power and enthusiasm..." Don't sweat, Mr. Lelewel. We know there are many Tartars in the Crimea, so the Russians may understand those dreadful Crimean Sonnets, which I don't and am not going to read. Little loss, Sir. You may even boast that since you read Horace in school, you haven't touched a native poet, afraid of spoiling your taste. You should learn the Golden Age is over. Mickiewicz addressed that to you after Krasicki. Put things foreign to the side. Speak your mind and think with your head, and create with your own imagination. Look up to your own people for inspiration. Here you are! They start an argument about Romanticism, only to end with... revolution. ODE TO YOUTH Master told you, Fr?d?ric, to get up right away. What do you want from me? It's Sunday. Then listen: Morality, among academic youth, is declining for lack of humility before the church. Senator Novosiltsov obeyed the Bishop and ordered, once a week, an inspection to see if the young confess at the appointed time and regularly go to church... - Who is she? - Who? In the organ gallery. - Who is she? - Who? I see dozens of them, the whole conservatory. But that... The first one... Konstancja Gladkowska. That godless man's playing off-key. Have you gone crazy? No sense of shame? A concert in the church? - Let's go. Quick. - You want the Board of Education - to take care of you? - What do you want? He played so off-key he'd have thrown a saint off balance. Would have thrown a saint off balance? So it was his fault, whereas I, the fool, thought it was she. What she? Why pick on me? I beg you. Introduce me to that goddess! So that's the point: the goddess! WARSAW UNIVERSITY NATIONAL EXHIBIT OF ARTS What a nice surprise. Let me, ladies, introduce our friend Chopin. If anyone in Warsaw didn't know Mr. Chopin's talent, after today's concert, they'll no doubt know about him. Exactly. You have to admit. Have you ever had such an accompaniment as today? These are not all his talents yet. He is an excellent expert on plastic arts. Fr?d?ric, show Miss Gladkowska around the hall. You were to show me around, whereas you act like a mute statue. This is a school of painting I adore. Those delicate pastels... white complexion... golden hair... Do you want to accompany me again? No... God forbid. I want to show you the models of the Grand Theatre they're building in Warsaw. Mr. Corazzi has made a few models. The one you see is the first. Here's another by Mr. Corazzi. The difference only shows in the colonnades. - What's this model? - A hospital. Strange. So far I've been thinking it's the last final model of the Grand Theatre. Yes, indeed, please forgive me. It's of the theatre. The model of the new hospital is further on. It makes not much difference, Lieutenant. Mozart would say that every theatre is a lunatic asylum. And the opera is a ward for the terminal cases. You're very kind to a future singer. Thank you for the lesson in historical painting and... the accompaniment. I'll be damned if I ever dare accompany you. What a pity. I was scheduled to sing at Count Skarbek's in Zelazowa Wola. I thought you'd accompany me. It is far to Zelazowa Wola today. But for the downpour, we'd be there in a few hours. We'll have been lucky to arrive by night. - Are you all right? - No, why? - Have we landed in a ditch? - A wheel has broken. Nothing can be done. Let's look for a place to sleep. I see something glimmer. It must be a cabin. Let's go. Hey, anyone there? Open up! Don't be afraid, old man. Our carriage wheel is broken. The young master must warm himself. Who were you afraid of? Father, call Anka. Anka! Anka! The manor wants Anka as a servant. That's against the law. We give the manor its due, The presbytery gets its due. Come here, Anka. Don't be scared! And now they demand his youngest from Father. Come to the fireside and get warm. The young master won't mind. I'll ride to the manor on horseback to get you a coach, Sir. Let him go! Who gave you the right to harass an old man? - We're from Count Branicki. - Let him go! Are you to see the count? No, Count Skarbek. - What's your name, Sir? - Chopin. Count Skarbek's tutor's son! But I have our count's order! Don't stand there! Take him to the manor! There's a little garden, in the field as painted. Who painted it? My darling Jasio... Come, Sir, would you like a ride? We'll be happy if it's on your way? Gee up! Gee up! Fr?d?ric, back to the drawing room. Fr?d?ric! Where have you hidden in this fog? Konstancja! Konstancja! Konstancja! Konstancja! Konstancja! A high forest, a low field, where my horses used to eat They'd eat days and nights Herded by my azure eyes... - Praise the Lord. - For ever and ever. Be seated, Sir. You must've lost your way. Indeed. How do you know? I guess so. There is only bog around with a passage near the river. Whereas you've come along from the wood, across the swamp. When I play for them, they don't shy. Could you lead me? I must be back at the manor in Zelazowa Wola. The horses can't be left alone. There're lots of animals around. You'll find the way near the river in the morning. Take a rest, Sir. Give the gentleman a sheepskin, Bronka. Watch the horses. I'll take a nap now. TODAY, JULY 14, 1830, A VIOLIN CONCERT BY NICCOLO PAGANINI Divine! Devil incarnate! Great master! He's signed a pact with the Beelzebub! - Angels can't sing so fine! - Yuck! Sinister force! Fr?d?ric! Hey, night watchman! Lead us, brother. Ninety-six staccato notes for a single bow! Unheard of! Those arpeggios! Good heavens! Cantabile! He showed you can do without a big orchestra... Why dozens of French horns, trumpets, or kettle drums! You can express the whole heart, misery, happiness, and the whole world with a single instrument! Fr?d?ric, take a lantern! To play! To play! Who'll tell me now that you can't do it with the piano alone. ...Fr?d?ric Chopin - a singular ability, a musical genius... To you Fr?d?ric, may Polish music resound throughout Europe. To your trip. To have Polish music resound throughout Europe, Fr?d?ric must afford to go there, Whereas minister Mostowski has refused him a scholarship: "We can't share the opinion that public funds be wasted by encouraging artists of this kind.? You should've said it earlier! We'll appeal to the Prince minister. Lubecki can overrule Mostowski's decision. Let me introduce, gentlemen, the highest priest of Warsaw Polyhymnia, Rector Elsner and his most talented student, Mr. Chopin. Since Your Highness is so kind to our school, I take the liberty... Excuse me... Novosiltsov is here. His Highness does not even want to see him... Here you are, gentlemen. Our homeland has been in a sorry plight many a time. Let's hope that who saved her during the reign of Alexander will save her when ruled by Nicholas. To the man of the moment- Prince Czartoryski. Prince Adam. Welcome, senator. Have you seen it? The whole elegant Warsaw has come, including your chief Jacobin - Lelewel. Quite possible, as you put it, that Lelewel is our chief Jacobin. Why do you, dear senator, impute the doubtful Jacobinic dignities to other Poles? Don't defend yourself, Prince. The Poles are Jacobins. Revolution runs in the blood of this nation. They suck it with mother's milk. And Pestel, Rileyev, Colonel Muraviev, and the revolutionary outbreak in Petersburg, are also of Polish doing? Certainly there are many revolutionaries among Poles, but the Russians don't have a shortage of them either. Is it true that you're going abroad? If I get a scholarship, no financial problems will stand in my way. - Are there any others? - I wonder if I conquer Europe. I'm afraid to lose someone who is... Shall we dance, Madame? Please wait. I'll soon be back. Bye, Fr?d?ric. I made an appointment with Witwicki and Mochnacki. Wait, I'm coming along. They'll tell me to play now. Don't be sad, Fr?d?ric. You'll go out into the world and will have your share of worries and joys. You must have fortitude, like a man. But I only have a long nose. Rather than the height of Lieutenant Pisarzewski, the shapely legs of Bezobrazov, only a long nose. I can barely tune the piano, let alone tune in myself. Fr?d?ric, wait! A BALL TONIGHT. EVENING DRESS CODE. - Stefan! - Fr?d?ric! Come here... and drink with me. I'd be happy to, but you know I don't like it. I don't like you so down in the dumps. Why you brother keep on musing Let the doldrums go to hell Now my friend down your drink The world's not worth a tinker's damn. - not worth a tinker's damn. - You come to create here? In her honour. Look, isn't she worth it? Barmaid, barmaid, What're you doing? Stop! Smiling at him, you spill and spill On my tunic - mead! Won't forgive you, will smother with kisses those peepers and brow, Small feet, white teeth Set on fire my heart! You must write music to this. Come, come. The officer cadets demand that we start a revolution, having put it off so often. You won't stop them this time. News of a revolution circle around Warsaw. Before the New Year, craftsmen wanted to quit. Someone must take responsibility for our revolution. Let's seek agreement with those the country respects, with the Sejm. Could you arrange a meeting with Lelewel? With Lelewel... Excuse me, I seem to know you. You're mistaken. He recognised me. He's a snooper! Me too, I'm afraid. Go! We'll stop him! One moment. You aren't mistaken. - We know each other well. - How come? You're mistaken. I don't know you. You don't remember. It's not kind of you. Come. We'll raise a glass to this nice encounter. Miss, aqua vitae make it triple! Oh no, no, no. Let me, gentlemen, drink with this nice citizen. To revolution! No, no, no. It doesn't behoove to leave old friends. Let's drink! To undo all snoopers! Don't you want to drink to undo all snoopers?! To Warsaw craftsmen. What? Don't you want to drink to the craftsmen brotherhood? Friends, someone here despises Varsavians! Barmaid, barmaid. What're you doing? Stop! Smiling at him you spill and spill On my tunic - mead! Smiling at him, you spill and spill On my tunic - mead!... Why you brother keep on musing Let the doldrums go to hell Now my friend down your drink The world's not worth a tinker's damn. Now my friend down your drink The world's not worth a tinker's damn! Won't forgive you, will smother with kisses those peepers and brow Small feet, white teeth, Set on fire my heart! Small feet, white teeth, Set on fire my heart! Won't forgive... Small feet, white teeth, Set on fire my heart! Have you heard? A revolution in Paris. The king is said to have abdicated. Run to Mochnacki's editorial office. They should know if it's true. The news of a revolution in France has caused a slump in the Warsaw stock market. The fall of the Bourbons! An upheaval in Italy. Is the editor-in-chief in? No, he left with Mr. Witwicki. - Mr. Witwicki home? - Yes, but... He's in conference with Mr. Mochnacki. I won't disturb them, then. I'll wait in the drawing room. It must be Fr?d?ric. We can go on. We cannot be heard there. We must finally set the date of the uprising. You know about the recent arrests. We can't wait till they lock all of us up. Let Mochnacki finish first. I keep asking who's accountable for Poland still under the czarist yoke? No bones about it - it's those who rule the Patriotic Association. It's easy to look for the guilty party. It hardly behooves you. You always have two opinions about anything. - What are you driving at? - No time for idle talk. Five years ago, Muraviev asked if the Poles would rise once the Russians started a revolution? Why weren't we given a go ahead to start an uprising? Now that the Russian conspirators have been bled white and the revolution suppressed, are we to rise alone with no support? Forget about the past. Think about the future. This means a distrust of victory, the strength and honour of the nation! Not true! Let's learn a lesson from the past. The nobility lost the cause, ignoring Kollataj's advice to combine an armed uprising with a social revolution! Calling us to fight the nobility in a fratricidal struggle? A civil war rather than a war against the czar? Leave social issues to those in a free homeland. - We'll start with or without you! - Let Deputy Lelewel speak. The Sejm has reinstated flogging of peasants and townspeople. The nobility won't part with the land appropriated from the people. What are the people to defend, to shed their blood for? A nobility rebellion? Give the people freedom and land. No more indentured peasants and exploitation! Burn the accused nobility's whip, give the people their homeland! Only then will millions defend Poland and we'll win! The most expert politician, Prince Czartoryski, warns against the turmoil of a social revolution. No abolition of the indentureship without Sejm's resolution. We are unknowns. If we infringe the Sejm's rights, no authority respected in the country will join a revolutionary government. One such man would be enough with his intellect, - will and... strength. - Of the Bonaparte family? We saw one like that in France betray the revolution... Sir, this is not a lecture in history. This is not about putting on a pedestal. Our duty is to start! - The nation will join! - The Sejm will pass laws and choose - the authorities! - Fight first. Politicking later. After the recent arrests, our union's in great peril. Hence we, the military, want to set the date of the uprising as soon as possible. Go on playing, Fr?d?ric. Who knows how long we will be able to listen to you? Has the news of the French revolution unnerved you so much? Is it true? As true as can be. In Italy also. Splendid! My trip abroad will be postponed. You don't want to go? Didn't you tell us that only abroad, free of patriotic sentiments, you'll learn your worth. That's right... I don't have the money for the trip yet. Elsner counts on Lubecki's scholarship. I don't. Great men's favours are uncertain. The Prince is still busy. His Highness Prince Czartoryski. Let me start, Your Highness. I had a delegation of tradesmen with Mr. Zajdel, warning of a revolution of the commoners. My police tell me there are symptoms of disturbances among apprentices. What does it have to do with our conversation? They say you can do everything in Poland. And you they call the uncrowned king. You'd better look at the French king's fate. A revolution in Poland will start with an abolition of indentureship and end with our beheading. I'm just back from the Great Prince. Alas, Prince Konstanty is right. In this plight only a strong union with the Russian empire can save us from a revolution. When will Fr?d?ric come? No Fr?d?ric here. I've been looking for you. Officer cadets have decided to rise October 10 - 20 with an attempt on Konstanty's life at the first concert assigned during these days. - What about Lubecki? - He didn't receive us. I don't believe in anything, even Radziwill's promises. You give up the trip? I may collect from the concert between the 10th and 20th of October. October 10 - 20? Elsner will even try to have Konstanty attend. - Can't you change the date? - The hall will be occupied later. I'm gripped with fear to play a large hall. What if nobody comes to my farewell concert? Warsaw has failed to come? - Pietrek! - He's run away! - Pietrek?! - No, Charles. What Charles? Charles X, French king. The Czartoryski family did not come. But it will enough for Fr?d?ric's trip. I wonder if Konstanty will come? Well, where's Chopin? High time for your revolutionary to start. Wysocki is waiting for Konstanty. Warn Lelewel before he enters. Sir... Officer cadets have taken seats near Konstanty's box. If there's an assassination, you'll be the suspect. I've been seen. If I back out now, this will raise eyebrows. - Has Konstanty come? - Expected any minute. Konstanty won't come, Goszczynski says. There are inscriptions in town: Long live craftsmen! On Konstanty's residence: Belvedere to let from New Year on. The whole Warsaw is highly charged. The whole Warsaw is expecting a better weather, Sir. Konstanty must've been warned. Hence his absence. You're leaving? You're leaving... I didn't want to... Didn't I tell you the world is open before you? What do you say? If your music school has all such students, I bow low. He was 11, When old Zywny refused to teach him. The student knew more than the teacher. I'm 60 now, I may not understand everything. Great talents may follow new roads, establishing new laws of their own. I may not see you again any more. This is a farewell for ever. Well, farewell, my dearest... Hello, old Vienna, the town where Fr?d?ric Chopin will be famous! Close the window or pay me 10 zloty. - Why? - Close the window. Should I catch a cold and pay for the doctor myself? - Where are you going? - To Dr. Malfatti. - How do you know if he's good? - He treats Emperor Francis himself. He treated and was a friend of Beethoven. The most outstanding musicians meet in his house. So I want him to treat me too, telling those beasts, the Viennese publishers, to print pieces by Mr. Chopin. Graf Gallenberg has offered you a concert sans remuneration. I refused. Have you been to the publishers, to Hasslinger? He has some of my pieces, which he called - unusual and wonderful... - And told you to be patient as great things don't need to hurry and didn't pay you a dime. He might've given you a watch. How do you know? He ridiculed me. When I told him his watch had stopped, "Exactly like the sale of your pieces," he quipped. You shouldn't have taken offense. He gives poor watches only to very good composers. Mozart was among them. So you advise... Show me your tongue. You understand? You know I'm a doctor. Breathe! A deep breath! A bad cold. I haven't heard such a wonderful orchestra for a long time. Yuck! How do you swear in Polish? For instance: - Dammit! - Dammit? Do all you geniuses have to be ill? I'll take care of your musical matters if you start treatment! You're invited tonight. Some Jesuits will come to listen to music for free and a few musicians who seek support from the omnipotent Jesuits in Vienna. Dammit! A Czech will come, a violinist of genius, who isn't ill - Slavik. What's the matter with Vienna? Yes, kind sir? Never during the reign of Emperor Francis. No papers at this time of day?! The censorship is swamped with work these days. A new paper, ladies and gentlemen. Here. A wonderful boy, this Slavik. I've never heard a better violinist since Paganini. Welcome, Chopin, the best pianist in the world! One can't have a moment of peace, even in a caf?. Peace and order since the accursed July revolution in Paris?! There's turmoil there all the time. Holland, Italy, Saxon city states. Even here, the rabble starts shouting: Jesuits to swing from lampposts! And now Warsaw! We're not in Warsaw! Thank God and our Chancellor Metternich - no uprising in Vienna yet. Those Poles stir up turmoil everywhere! An uprising in Warsaw... It's the wind beating against the drainpipes. Mr. Chopin? Here. An express letter. From Warsaw... from my parents. They don't want me to return. My respects. Very reasonable people. I've been explaining for hours with your health, you'll be no use in the rising. Heavenly weakling. Let everyone do what they can. You're a musician. What can my music do? They give blood... Ever been to the mountains? Even a quiet shepherd's song can start an avalanche. No, no. Leave me alone. I can't put up with your arguing any longer. I won't stay, no... A coach to Warsaw left in the morning. Off you go! The next one - in two days. Give me an express coach to catch up with it. I'll pay you what you wish. Good. Faster, faster... Faster, faster... Sir, sir, you hear me? The road's snowbound. We must go back... I'm one of those doctors who don't lie to patients. You have miserable health. It's unthinkable for you to stand a soldier's hardships. Beware! You might live long, but I doubt if you survive another flu. I can't do anything for my country. What's left for me to do? Es lebe Polen! Nieder mit Metternich! Nieder! Es lebe Polen! Vive la Pologne! Regardez! Un Polonais. - Stefan! - Dear Fr?d?ric! - How come you're here? - Ask the old lady history. My dear! Have you seen my folks? Mother, sisters? - To Roi Taranne. - Better to my place. All Poles who come to Paris gather on Taranne. Prince Czartoryski has the floor. We're against the members of Lelewel's National Committee. They're accountable for the uprising's fall. Rather than unite against Moscow, they spoke of how to abolish the indentureship, pitting the peasants against the nobility. Poland will long remember the night of August 15 when Poles hanged Poles. The people hanged traitors! Now Lelewel's politics will scare away and discourage European governments. They will refuse to help and won't negotiate with us. Lelewel's committee wasn't chosen by a legal, rightful Sejm. It has no mandate, nor any most distinguished Poles sit on it. Deputy Lelewel. Bitter and painful are the words I turn to you with, you who gave your blood and are now homeless, that Poland had to fall. There were too few honest defenders of the homeland, for those were missing who are the most numerous - millions of peasants. Even facing the enemy, the greatest peril to Poland, the nobility wouldn't return the land appropriated from the people. Now the party of aristocrats whispers in the corners, and Prince Czartoryski insinuated out loud that there are Moscow agents among us. Truth to tell, we wanted to call Russian regiments to unite against the czar's despotism, weighing down them and us. But it wasn't us, Prince, who called godless the secret unions, conspiring against the czar, nor received the papal endorsement to that effect. You say we don't have a mandate of the Sejm. He has the true one, who speaks on behalf of the oppressed, devoid of rights, who will unite the holy rights of the people with the love of homeland, who will integrate the interest of our country with that of mankind. FOR YOUR FREEDOM AND OURS. Bogdan? Bogdan! Stefan! Fr?d?ric! Poland has not perished yet As long as we still live That which foreign force has seized We at swordpoint shall retrieve. March, march, Dabrowski From Italy to our Polish land Let us now unite the nation Under thy command. God, how much we've lived through those two years. You think the fight is over? No! Only our youth is. What's going on? Why? Why? You'll soon see. Lelewel was right a hundred times. No governments or diplomacy, or the dying order of things supports our uprising, but a new order, splendid, revolutionary and terrible, as everything that is to come and what the peoples are looking forward to! - Long live the revolution! - Down with the gendarmes! Work and bread in place of bayonets! - Long live Poland! - Long live the brotherhood of people! The end
