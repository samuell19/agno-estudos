Cheerleaders: ...FIGHT! W-I-N! LET ME HEAR YOU SAY WIN. Crowd: WIN! Cheerleaders: TOGETHER AGAIN... GO, FIGHT, WIN! GO, BILLY! COME ON! COME ON, WHOO! GO, BILLY, WHOO! ( cheering ) BILLY, PLEASE. LET'S DO IT TONIGHT. BABY, I CAN'T. WE BOTH WANT IT. NO! I'M SORRY. WE'VE BEEN GOING TOGETHER ALL YEAR AND NOW I'M LEAVING FOR COLLEGE. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL. LOTS OF GIRLS DO IT BEFORE THEY'RE MARRIED. STOP IT! MAYBE I'D BETTER DO SOMETHING ELSE. WILL YOU MARRY ME, ALLISON? I LOVE YOU. OH, BILLY... YES. LET'S DO IT TONIGHT, THEN. ( Allison screaming ) Allison: BILLY! Man: COME HERE. RIGHT INTO THE VAULT. Allison: BILLY! GOT YOUR MOUTH BACK, PUNK. DON'T LET IT GET YOU IN TROUBLE. Allison: BILLY! WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? Welcome to the Legion of Iron... Billy. WHO ARE YOU? I'm Diana and I own you. You're so far from civilization you hardly need to worry about it. YOU OWN ME? ARE YOU NUTS? That's a good question. What is sanity? Just what the strong think is right. I am the strongest here. You were brought here for one reason-- to kill. You are my slave. YOU'RE A CRAZY, FUCKING BITCH. You will worship me like a queen. Anything less will be dealt with severely. Perhaps I'll leave you down there for a few days... or years. So you can think it over. WAIT, WAIT! ALLISON, MY GIRL... WHERE IS SHE? I can assure you, we'll make good use of her. Besides, the fighters are not allowed the pleasures of a woman until they kill. And if you do make it that far I just might have you for myself. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE THE PRIZE FOR TONIGHT'S VICTOR. A FEMALE SLAVE. ONLY 18 WHOM I HAVE RECHRISTENED APHRODITE FOR THE GODDESS OF LOVE. ( applause ) SHE'S A VERY SPECIAL PRIZE, INDEED. A RARE FIND. A VIRGIN. WHERE WE GOING? SHUT UP, PUNK. SLAVES DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. ( cheering ) IT AIN'T FOOTBALL. KILL HIM! KILL HIM! KILL HIM, KILL HIM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! Man: WE GOT HIM, NOW. WE GOT HIM. FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM, FREEDOM, FREEDOM... JONAH SAID YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND. THERE SHE IS, BOY. SHE'S THE PRIZE... TO THE WINNER. ALLISON! ALLISON! ALLISON, I'M HERE! LOOK AT ME. ALLISON, I'M HERE. YOU SON OF A BITCH! BRING HIM HERE! TOUCH HER AND I'LL KILL YOU. Diane: TAKE YOUR VIRGIN, REX. ENJOY HER. SEE YOU IN THE ARENA. GODDAMN IT... FUCK! Diane: TAKE HIM TO MY QUARTERS. YOUR QUARTERS? YES. I'D LIKE TO PUNISH THIS SLAVE PERSONALLY. NO... PLEASE... NO. COME HERE. NO. I SAID, COME HERE! ( loud knocking ) COME IN. TIE HIM UP. MMM... SO YOUNG. WHY DON'T WE SEE WHAT'S ON TV TONIGHT? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? ( screaming ) STOP IT! LOOK, BITCH... Damn you! NO... NO... NO! WHAT'S THE MATTER? SON OF A BITCH! DON'T LIKE THE SHOW? NO! NO! PLEASE! WATCH! NO! NO! NO, STOP IT! WHO'S NEXT? CAN YOU KILL HIM? YOU CAN HAVE HER IF YOU DO. YOU CAN HAVE ANY OF HIS GIRLS. BUT YOU WON'T CARE ABOUT THEM. BECAUSE IF YOU KILL REX... YOU CAN HAVE ME. WHAT DOES YOUR GIRLFRIEND KNOW ABOUT PLEASURE? OR LUST? OH, GOD... I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST A BAD DREAM. IT'S NOT SO BAD IF YOU'RE WITH A WINNER. REX IS A CHAMPION. HE'LL BE FREE SOON. WHEN THAT HAPPENS HE MIGHT TAKE US WITH HIM. NOT SO BAD? THIS PLACE IS LIKE... IT'S LIKE HELL. I DON'T KNOW. I GET TREATED OKAY AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS MAKE IT WITH REX. I'M HIS FAVORITE. BUT THAT'S JUST LIKE A WHORE. DON'T YOU SEE? ALL OF US-- WE'RE JUST THEIR WHORES. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT UNTIL WE GET OUT. GET OUT? DO YOU THINK THEY'LL JUST LET US GO? WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO US WHEN WE GET OLD AND UNATTRACTIVE? I know you think you're in hell, but you can win your freedom. I was captured, too, but I earned my way out. $10 million is the magic number. Win that and you'll be set free. You keep ten percent-- a million dollars. I'LL BET. And your women, too. Yeah, I'm free now, and rich. I have no desire to tell anyone where I've been. Why should I? I've gone from hell to heaven on earth. And you can, too, if you've got the stuff. It's not easy. It took me 20 fights to the death but if you're man enough you can fight your way out and live! One of the proud few in the Legion of Iron! Crowd: Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! GET UP. YOU'VE GOT COMPANY. HOW YOU FEELING? WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? NAME'S WAGNER. YOU BETTER SHAKE IT, MAN. I'M THE ONLY FRIEND YOU GOT. HEY, YOU'RE LYLE WAGNER-- the best running back the Pac 10 ever had. 14 years in the N.F.L. THEN YOU JUST DISAPPEARED. SAME AS YOU, THEY NABBED ME, TOO. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? IS SHE CRAZY? This Diana? Lyle: That girl-- Rex's prize at the match-- IS SHE SPECIAL TO YOU? HE RAPED ALLISON. AND HE RAPED MY GIRL. I'LL KILL HIM. HE'D SWAT YOU LIKE A FLY. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OUT, AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE-- TO TEACH YOU TO FIGHT. If she wants me to fight, I'll fight him. PUSSY MAY GET YOU HARD, BUT IT MAKES YOUR BRAIN SOFT. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME BASIC SKILLS. WE'LL START FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. ( door opens ) Man: MY, MY, WHAT A PRETTY BOY. YEAH, FRESH MEAT. WE JUST WANT YOUR ASS, BABE. DO IT! GET OUT OF HERE! I OUGHT TO BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF. THE OWNER WILL CUT YOUR BALLS OFF. I'M WORTH ONE MILLION A MATCH TO HER-- WHAT ARE YOU WORTH? HOW DID YOU GET OUT? AIN'T YOU HEARD? SUPERMAN'S BLACK, FREAK-FACE. GET IN YOUR CELL. YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE OR I'LL TELL THE OWNER YOU SCREWED UP LOCKING ME IN. YOU AIN'T HEARD THE LAST OF THIS. OH, GO HUMP EACH OTHER. COME ON. THANKS. NO PROBLEM. YOU KNOW WHEN WE WAS TALKING BEFORE? DIANA WAS WATCHING US. THAT'S WHY I SAID I BELIEVED THAT SHIT ABOUT GETTING OUT. I DON'T. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE JUST WASTES THE GUYS WHO MAKE IT. BUT YOUR ONLY HOPE FOR NOW IS WINNING. SO JUST GET SOME SLEEP. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FIGHT, YOU SHIT. GET OUT OF THE WAY. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? HE AIN'T BEEN THE SAME SINCE HE GOT HIT IN THE HEAD. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WEAPONS ROOM. NEW FIGHTER. THAT BASTARD! HOLD ON, MAN. LET ME GO! COOL OFF, MAN. I WANT TO KILL HIM NOW! SOON. HE'S A KILLING MACHINE. HE WASN'T KIDNAPPED, HE VOLUNTEERED.

THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN IS DEATH. GREAT. DIG IT, MAN. LAUGH AT IT. IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE DEAD. SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU EVER THINK OF BREAKING OUT OF HERE? TOO MANY GUARDS. AND SO MANY OF US. IT AIN'T PEOPLE TOGETHER. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T TRIED. NOBODY TRUSTS ME. FIRST OF ALL, I'M BLACK. SECOND, I'M THE TRAINER. THEY THINK I'M TOO CLOSE TO DIANA. THERE ARE SPIES, MAN. SOME OF THE GIRLS ARE SPIES. EVERYONE'S PARANOID. EVEN THE GUARDS. DIANA LIKES IT LIKE THAT. WE NEVER KNOW WHEN SHE'S WATCHING. HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A SPY? I GUESS YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO TRUST ME. NOT BAD. RIGHT. NICE FIGHT. YOU COULD HAVE HAD HIM IF YOUR CLUB HADN'T BROKEN. BUT IN THE ARENA, MAN, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD LUCK.

I HOPE YOU ENJOYED BILLY'S PUNISHMENT BECAUSE I'VE CONCOCTED A NEAT ONE FOR YOU. I'VE DECIDED TO REWARD ALL THOSE MEN THAT WENT THROUGH SO MUCH TROUBLE TO BRING YOU BACK. OH, THERE MUST BE 15 OR 20 OF THEM. I'VE DECIDED TO GIVE THEM TO YOU FOR THE NIGHT. YOU'LL BE THE ONLY GIRL AT THE PARTY. IT WILL BE FUN, WON'T IT? NO. PLEASE. I ASKED YOU A QUESTION. ANSWER ME. YES! YES, YOUR MAJESTY. THE MORE, THE MERRIER. YOU HEARD ME. TAKE ME. I WANT IT. IT CAN'T WAIT. I WANT IT NOW. THIS IS DELICIOUS. OH, GO ON, CAL. I'M SURE YOU CAN PULL RANK AND HAVE HER FIRST. GET RID OF THAT KID. HE'S MORE TROUBLE THAN HE'S WORTH. I DON'T PAY YOU TO THINK. WHAT GOOD IS HE DEAD? HE'S WORTH COLD, HARD CASH. HE'LL FIGHT REX AS SOON AS HE'S HEALED. WHO'S DUMB ENOUGH TO BET ON HIM? I AM. I WISH I WERE DEAD. YEAH, THAT'S REAL COOL. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO DO FOR YOUR GIRL? THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO FOR HER ANYWAY. YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOME REST. TALK SOFTLY. SHE MIGHT BE WATCHING US. WE CAN STILL BREAK HER OUT OF HERE. HOW? THE PROBLEM WAS YOU DID IT ALONE. MASS MUTINY IS THE ONLY WAY. THERE'S TOO MUCH POWER AGAINST US. US, MAN, US. YOU GOT TO START THINKING LIKE A TEAM. I MEAN, YOU PLAY BALL. IT TAKES EVERYONE TO WIN. BUSTING OUT WILL TAKE THAT SAME KIND OF ENERGY. SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? I'VE GOT A PLAN BUT FIRST YOU'VE GOT TO BEAT REX. IT'S A PIPE GUN. I CAN MAKE THEM FROM BEDPOSTS. THE CHAMPION'S ROOM HAS THAT ORGY BED. KILL REX AND YOU GET IT. I CAN MAKE FOUR MORE OF THESE SUCKERS. THEN, MY MAN, ALL WE NEED IS SOME BULLETS. YOU HEARD ME, DICK-FACE. ON YOUR KNEES! ALL THE WAY, MAN. YOU FUCKER! HEY, MAN, STOP IT! BACK OFF, MAN. YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE. YEAH, AND THEN I'LL FIGHT YOU. YOU GOT TO WORK ON THAT ONE. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. Diana: BILLY, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SEE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. HI, BABY. REMEMBER ME? I'M STILL HOT FOR YOU. DON'T WORRY. I'M STILL A VIRGIN, BABY. EVERY TIME I DO IT, IT'S LIKE THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE I LOVE IT SO MUCH. ISN'T SHE WONDERFUL? WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'VE BEEN GIVING HER LESSONS. CAN YOU TELL? EAT SHIT AND DIE, YOU BITCH. YOU'RE REAL BIG WITH THE GOONS HOLDING ME, HUH? WHY DON'T YOU CALL THEM OFF AND LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT YOU? RELEASE HIM. YOU HEARD ME, RELEASE HIM! GIVE HIM A SWORD. SO, YOU WANT TO KILL ME? YOU EVER TALK TO ME LIKE THAT AGAIN I'LL KILL YOU. I SUGGEST YOU TRAIN HARDER OR REX WILL DO IT FIRST. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID WRONG? YEAH, I WAS SCARED. I BLINKED WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATING. I FELT IT. YEAH, THAT'S IT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO, MAN. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN IS DEATH. SO, FUCK IT, MAN. SWING HARDER. YOU GOT NOTHING TO LOSE. FUCK IT! DEATH, MAN. DEATH! THAT'S DEATH, MAN. YOU'RE AN ANIMAL. A KILLER. I GOT YOU. My lead guy will kick their ass. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU HERE. It's my pleasure. I HOPE NOT. ( no audio ) COME ON, REX! COME ON, REX! GO, REX! GET HIM! COME ON, BILLY. FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! ( cheering ) SO, YOU WON AFTER ALL. I'M SO PLEASED. YOU WON ME A FORTUNE. ANOTHER ONE. THEN LEAVE ME ALONE. SOON ENOUGH. YOU'RE A KILLER NOW. YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE GIRLS YOU WANT EVEN YOUR SWEET ONE. THAT IS, IF YOU STILL WANT HER. OF COURSE, SHE IS KIND OF A SLUT. OH, SPIT ON ME, BABY, IF IT TURNS YOU ON. I HATE YOU. OF COURSE YOU DO. LOVE AND HATE ARE THE SAME THING. BULLSHIT. LOVE, HATE. GOOD, BAD. POWER DECIDES WHAT'S RIGHT. I LEARNED THAT IN THE CASINOS. ALL THE HIGH ROLLERS WOULD FLY IN. I THOUGHT THEY WERE SUCKERS. I THOUGHT I HAD IT MADE BUT I WAS THE BIGGEST SUCKER OF THEM ALL. I HAD PIT BOSSES TELLING ME WHO TO FUCK. NO, I VOWED THEN THAT I'D NEVER WORK FOR THAT HOUSE AGAIN. I'D OWN THAT HOUSE. BUT HOW? I HAD NO POWER, NO MONEY. I WAS JUST A WOMAN. THEN I REALIZED... SEX IS POWER. I CAN HAVE ANYTHING I WANT... ANYTHING. SO, YOU SEE, BILLY THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG. THERE'S JUST PASSION. HOW DOES IT FEEL? DOES IT FEEL NICE? DOES IT FEEL REAL NICE? OH, GOD. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE HAD A WOMAN? FOUR MONTHS? SIX? EVER? DOES IT FEEL GOOD? YES. BUT YOU HATE ME. DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP? NO. COME ON, BILLY, HATE ME. KEEP HATING ME. Lyle: I'M TAKING ANOTHER WOMAN. Woman: THE HELL YOU ARE! DO WHAT I SAY. I AIN'T DOING IT NO THREE-WAY. LUTHER, GET DOWN HERE! I GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU. NO, NO! THIS SLAVE'S GOT A PROBLEM SHARING ME WITH ANOTHER CHICK. SO I WONDERED IF YOU WOULD ENJOY A LITTLE ACTION TONIGHT. REALLY? YEAH, SURE. LYLE, PLEASE... LYLE, DON'T. TAKE HER. WE'LL SEE IF YOU'RE MORE AGREEABLE TOMORROW. COME ON. WE'LL HAVE US A GOOD TIME. I'VE ARRANGED A TEAM MATCH WITH THE CHINESE. THE CHINESE? WHY NOT? DEATH'S INTERNATIONAL. I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY RIDING ON THIS. I NEED SOMEONE TO LEAD THE TEAM. YOU. WHAT ABOUT WAGNER? HE CAN'T. HE FIGHTS AN OPENING MATCH WITH THEIR BEST FIGHTER. IT'S UP TO YOU. IF WE WIN YOU'RE FREE TO GO. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE BEDPOSTS OFF? CAL WATCHES THE VIDEO MONITORS ALL NIGHT. FAKE AN ORGY. DO IT UNDER THE COVERS. YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. BUT WE STILL HAVE TO DISTRACT CAL. I GOT IT. GIVE HIM BETH... AND ALLISON. ALLISON? I CAN'T. YOU GOT TO. IF SHE GETS SUSPICIOUS, SHE COULD RUIN EVERYTHING. I'LL GET HER DRUNK. WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE WAKES UP? I CAN'T. I DID IT MYSELF. I GAVE DEBRA TO LUTHER LAST NIGHT. THAT'S HOW WE GOT THE BULLETS. CUT HIM DOWN. JESUS. DON'T YOU THINK HE DESERVES A FUNERAL?

WE WANT A FUNERAL! WE WANT A FUNERAL! WE WANT A FUNERAL! WE WANT A FUNERAL! WE WANT A FUNERAL! WE WANT A FUNERAL! ( whip cracking ) WHO STARTED THIS? HIM. STRETCH HIM OUT. NORMALLY I WOULD PUNISH ALL OF YOU FOR THIS INEXCUSABLE OUTBREAK! WHAT IS THE CAUSE FOR SUCH FURY? BIGGER CELLS, BETTER FOOD, YOUNGER WOMEN-- THESE THINGS I COULD UNDERSTAND BUT A CALL FOR A FUNERAL FOR THIS DIMWITTED, BLUBBERING PILE OF SKIN AND BONES? I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT. HE WAS A MAN. I DON'T WANT TO RIP YOU TO SHREDS. IT MAKES FOR A BAD FIGHT TOMORROW. HE DESERVES A FUNERAL. THAT'S TWO. I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT IF YOU'D REALIZE THIS SUB-HUMAN IS AS WORTHLESS DEAD AS HE IS ALIVE. DO YOU? NO. HE WAS ONE OF US. DO YOU? DO YOU?! Lyle: SAY YES, BILL. DON'T BE A FOOL. WELL, DO YOU? YES, DIANA. YES. DIANA... I HATE TO SAY I TOLD YOU... YOU SAY IT AND I'LL CUT YOUR TONGUE OUT.
