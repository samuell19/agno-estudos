[child laughing] [car horn honks] Mom, she's here. Come on, Mom. Shirley's here. I'll be right there. [music playing] Let's go, Mom. We're late. Come on, Mom. Hurry up. Do you have everything, Margaret, your papers? Yes. Yes. He'll be great, Gibson. Break a leg, Margaret. Thank you, Duncan. Don't talk too fast, Mom. Too fast. [music playing] Please welcome our special guest author, former winner of the Toronto Fiction Award, Margaret Gibson. [applause] Father, mother, child, a Trinity-- --broken. I'm sorry. Sorry. Mommy, I saw the neatest bike in the store today. As a matter of fact, it's on sale for $150, which is pretty cheap, I think. Wow. Well, when I finish my book we will have lunch with Kenneth Wagner at the Wessex Hotel, and you and I will have a big fat piece of cake. And I will get paid, and I will buy you that bike. Sunny side down. [SINGING] Down by the bay where the watermelons grow. I hope I didn't embarrass you too much of the reading tonight. - Oh, no. It's OK. Good night. I love you, . Love you too, Mommy. [music playing] [typewriter clicking] MARGARET GIBSON: You have everything you need, ? Uh-huh. Do you have your pills, Mom? MARGARET GIBSON: I don't know where they are. [sighs] [music playing] [typewriter clicking] Here you go. Mom, can you open this? Never mind. Bye, Mom. Bye, . [music playing] I hope it's OK, me barging in like this. These are lovely, lovely. Oh, Chekhov, Garnett's translation. Oh, it's been a day or two since short stories have been delivered to my very door. Thank you, Kenneth. I'm sorry about the fiasco at the reading. Oh, no, no. Oh, royalties from The Butterfly Ward. I'm the one store in Canada that still stocks copies. Well, the world is waiting for another one. I'm trying so hard to get it back. Well, you deliver that manuscript, Margaret, the money's waiting there for you. I'm trying to finish that damn book soon. I just haven't been feeling so well. What did Chekhov say? "My Holy of Holies is the human body, health, intelligence, and talent." Or something like that. Look, you get healthy and you finish the book, and the pressure's off you. OK. Oh. Nice, nice. Have you eaten today, Madam? How's the climate today? I made a complete fool of myself at the literary reading tonight. Yeah, so what? What do you think? Bathers at the beach? Supplicants in church. Oh, I like it. You're a wonderful painter, Shirley. It's true. It's true. It's true. You paint my hallucinations wonderfully well because that's due in part to the fact I describe my schizophrenia so eloquently. SHIRLEY: I got stuff at the deli, want anything? Where's my hairbrush, Shirley? It's right here [inaudible] What is this? This is new. It's just my new-- new-- old-- old deadline from Kenneth Wagner unhinging me a bit. What's this? Writing grant application. Yeah? I'll mail it for you. Everything in here? Yeah starving quasi renowned writer seeks art grant to stave off wolf at door. The mortgage, I am months behind. I'm talking foreclosure. I am screwed. A little more child support from Stuart wouldn't hurt here. He's on his third or fourth wife. His business is down. I need to pawn some more things to Mr. Obadiah. Where is ? It's 3:30. I wish I could spring for more than these groceries, kid, you know? I know, Shirley. I appreciate it. What are you going to do? Finish my masterpiece in three weeks, and maybe it'll make sense to Kenneth Wagner and not just you and me. Hi, Shirley. Hello, my little hugger mugger. Hello. Later, alligator. After while, crocodile. MARGARET GIBSON: What took you so long coming home from school, ? I thought you were dead in a ditch. Here we go again. Oh, this damn ribbon. Did you take your pills? You're beginning to sound like a broken record, . Did you take your blue ones? No, but if you give me a pink an orange and yellow and a green, then I will be a rainbow mom. Here you go. Hate these new blue ones. Empty, Mom. Let's go to Shoppers. Shoppers, Shoppers, come on, Mom, let's go. OK, OK, OK. Maybe after dinner. [typewriter clicking] [VOICEOVER]: Mrs. Vaughn, your prescription is now ready at the side counter. How are you this evening, Miss Gibson? Back again. Fine, fine. [music playing] [IMITATING GROVER] Hey, bright eyes. Oh, bright eyes. Take me home with you? It really sounds like Grover. [IMITATING GROVER] Oh, bright eyes. What do you say, put the creature up for the night? I think he wants me to take him home. Please can I, Mom? Come on. [IMITATING GROVER] Bouncey, bouncey, bounce, I am in the spin cycle. Help me [inaudible] I sit down. I sit down. Let me out, out, out. Mon dieu, who turned out the lights? I have gone blind. Grover, it's dark inside the bag. And it's night, and it's always dark at night. [IMITATING GROVER] Mon dieu, where is everybody? It's all right, Grove. We're adopting you, and I guess I'll have to take care of you because you seem pretty stupid. [IMITATING GROVER] Hey, hey, who is calling me stupid? Me. [IMITATING GROVER] Just do me one favor, OK? All right. [IMITATING GROVER] In the years to come you will think of me kindly and remember this, OK? You have just saved me from a fate worse than life itself. Grove, you're silly. [IMITATING GROVER] And blue too. [laughter] [radio static] ANNOUNCER [VOICEOVER]: --Brady Thompson. Thompson shoots. It's intercepted by Shepherd. Shepherd's down the ice-- [typewriter clicking] Golden shoots, he scores. [thunder claps] [typewriter clicking] [thunder claps] Oh, boy, Larry. What a night we're having in the Garden [inaudible].. Malenski is skating better-- Do you hear it? Hear what? [thunder claps] No. You see-- I don't see-- See what? That noise. I hear it. [music playing] [thunder claps] [margaret breathing heavily] [typewriter clicking] Don't do this! What's the matter, Mom? [thunder claps] What's wrong? Come on. [music playing] Mommy! They're just in your head. Plane! Can you see-- can you see-- Can you see them? Oh! AARON GIBSON: Mom, there are no planes. Help! Help us! Help us, please! Mom, it's OK. There are no planes. Mommy, it's OK. [music playing] I heard it. [margaret making panic sounds] Help! Help! Help us! AARON GIBSON: There are no planes. There are planes! AARON GIBSON: It's just in your head. Hey, help us! [knocking on the window] Help us! Hide us! Hide us, please. They're trying to hurt my son! Hey, you-- you must calm down. [margaret sobbing] My bones are shattering. I'm so ill, Aaron. I'm very ill. I'm going to call an ambulance, OK? I'm going to call an ambulance, Mommy, OK? [knocking on the window] Call an ambulance now. Hi. Is she all right? She's sleeping now. She'll be here for the night. Can I stay here? There's no place for you. I'm sorry. I haven't been able to get in touch with your father. How long has it been since you last saw him? I don't know, second grade? When your mom was here three years ago, who did you stay with then? Grandma Audrey. Can we call her? No, she's dead. PA SYSTEM [VOICEOVER]: Cardiac team to the ER, stat. Code Blue-- We have to make sure there's somebody to look after you. I can walk home alone. We got a Code Blue here. Uh, you're too young to go home alone. You stay put. I'll make a few phone calls. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. DOCTOR: Pick her up. I'm getting a reading. OK, everybody clear? Clear. All right, do it. That's it. [music playing] [aaron crying] [knock at the door] Hi, Aaron. I'm Donald Culver with Children's Services. I seen your mom's OK now. I came by to make sure you're all right too. I know you must be worried about your mom, huh? How would you like to be her escort? She gets out later today. Yeah. [music playing] [SCHOOL CHILDREN TALKING AMONGST THEMSELVES] Were you scared, Aaron? Are you scared, Grover? He didn't know what was going to happen. [IMITATING GROVER] Oh, bright eyes. Oh, bright eyes. Lady baby is sorry she's scared you like that, but you stuck by her. You were really good. You were really quite terrific. That hasn't happened in a long time, has it? [IMITATING GROVER] So how does it feel to have a sometimes crazy lady baby for a mama? Is it OK or is it not OK? Sometimes it's OK. Just because lady baby gets crazy sometimes it doesn't mean that you are, you know that? Yeah. Do you know how lucky I feel? You're my best friend, Mom. You're my best friend too, Aaron. Let's think of a word that means I love you, and we're the only ones in the world who will know what that word means. Can you think of a word? [margaret speaking gibberish] [laughter] Moogie. Moogie? Moogie. Moogie. [laughter] What's going on, Margaret? I am busily failing to meet my deadline for my book contract. Grace under pressure. I have always been able to figure out a way to write, even for just a couple of hours a day, no matter what. Write about me and you in high school. Just describe it exactly the way it was. You don't have to make up anything. You won't have to embellish. Now it'll be very strange, bizarre, you know? You'll sell it for a million dollars. You with that James Dean scowl of yours, and me with my very wonderful sense of humor. Remember you slashed your wrists, and I said, "Aw, Gibson, missed with your needlepoint again." [laughter] Oh, it was so bad. [telephone rings] SHIRLEY: I'll get it. Hello? Who's this? Just a second. It's Stuart. Will wonders never cease? Obviously, I'm at home. You called me here, didn't you? What do you want? Aaron hasn't seen you in eight months, Stuart. No. No, Aaron gets his heart broken every time you come and go. I'm not going let you do that to him. The-- the divorce decree is supposed to protect Aaron's best interests. I have to ask Karen. [slams the telephone down] Newly divorced, I suppose? Must have called him when I was in the hospital. Floor's all set, Mom. Presenting mom's famous-- well, not so famous spaghetti. Here, you go ahead. I'm not hungry. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. So tomorrow's a new one, huh? It's school holiday, right? A picnic, like usual? Yes. So did anything new and unusual and bizarre happen to you today? Because I received a phone call from your dad. Back again, back again. He wants to see you. Do you want to see him? You can think about it. Why does he want to see me? He is your dad, and he cares about you. [aaron sighs] Maybe I do want to see him. If he doesn't come, we'll go downtown or maybe take the subway to Shirley's or go to Shoppers. Do you think he forgot? You're too unforgettable. You must be Stuart. Sorry I'm late. Your ex-wives will survive you, Stuart, but God help your progeny. Hi, Aaron. How are you? Fine. I want to talk to you in private. Why can't Aaron hear? It's between us. Come on, Aaron. Get in the car. Well-- why? Aaron and I have no secrets. It's that old business. Oh, all right. Go ahead. I'll see you tonight. That social worker told me that he was alone in the house while you were in the hospital. One night, Aaron can take care of himself for one night. You might recall that in the divorce decree I get full custody if you are non compos mentis. Why so concerned all of a sudden, you between bad marriages? I'm worried about Aaron. Well, so worried you beat a path to his door for eight or nine months? So why did you go into the hospital? I was ill. I needed to rest. Yeah, the same old flipping the lid business. You haven't changed a bit, Margaret. I don't want Aaron here alone again while you're getting your head screwed on straight. In fact, I don't know if I want a crazy woman raising my son. You've known I've been schizophrenic all his life. It never seemed to bother you before. You're wrong. It's been bothering me for a long time now. You never once did anything to make me not be crazy. You were just so afraid of me. I'm not interested in the past. I'm not interested in rehashing the past. I'm talking about now. I'm not going let you make him crazy. All right. Here we go. Are you ready? Watch this. I'm staying with Grandma temporarily. She hasn't seen you since you were in diapers. I never wore diapers. So what's the third grader like yourselves' favorite thing to do these days, stuff you do with your friends? OK then, with your mom? Well, we go to Mr. Obadiah's and to the movies and-- How about a movie then? Pretty lousy. Your mom leaves you all alone in the house when she's in the hospital? And we go to Shoppers Drug Mart and to Dr. Gates' office. But that's boring because I have to sit in the waiting room. And we go on picnics and talk to Grover. Who's Grover? My adopted brother. [music playing] [clock ticking] AARON GIBSON: Hi, Shirley. Look what I got. Hello, my little hugger mugger. When are you going to come visit me in my studio again, huh? We'll play together. Okey-dokey, time to see if Blanche DuBois is up yet. Climate check. Hm, chilly. Up at the crack of noon and looking as cheerful as the county morgue. No sleep? Voices? No. Well, that's good. What is it, Margaret? I'm coming, and I'm going faster and faster. This is familiar, you turning my paintings around. I don't think I did that, Shirley. Maybe I just got tired of looking at them. Oh, all right. I can live with that. It's just that when we were roommates and things got bad, it started like this. I'm worried. God, are you sure this doctor knows what he's doing? No, no, no, I'm a walking pharmacy. Stuart saw Aaron. Well, that was whimsical of him. I'm afraid he'll try and take Aaron away from me. He threatened it, and he did. And if I lose the house-- No, you can't think about all these things at the same time. When you do, you just flip, Margaret. You have to think about trying to finish your book. I'm so scared. I can't work. I can't sleep. Somehow, in my head, the sounds of clocks has to do with the hospital. So I kept thinking, "Time breaks, time breaks." I'll lose him if I go in the hospital. I'll lose him. [music playing] [clock ticking] No! [clock ticking] [hammering the clock] [painting tears] [knocking on the door] Margaret? What happened, Margaret? Just tell me they were ripped off. Tell me the paintings were stolen, and they're not buried somewhere in-- Man, I cannot help but take this personally. This is really uncool. Why? Why? Because you exploit me. That's why. I'm a freak, aren't I? Come visit the freak for some artistic inspiration. I'm a bottomless pit of hallucinatory art. I don't want to hear this. I don't want to hear this. You're destroying yourself, Margaret. You got to do something. You've got to try. Aaron needs you to try. Please just do something or I can't watch this anymore. Then to hell with you. Do you really mean that? Go to hell. [shirley crying] [school bell rings] Aaron? Mommy need you to come home. I'll be right there, Mommy. [music playing] [TELEVISION] --goal is to become an elementary music teacher. Macy [inaudible], 18. I'm honored to represent the nation's capital, Ottawa. Good pizza. [TELEVISION] My aspirations are to attend university and further my career in acting. You got to eat, Mom. [TELEVISION] Tanya Memy, 20. I am proud to be representing the Niagara region, and I'm planning to-- Maraschino cherries in the salad, Aaron? No tomatoes. [telephone rings] I'll get it. Hello? Hi, Stuart. Just a minute. Here you go. Hello? No, not today. Maybe tomorrow. Because I need him with me. That's why, Stuart. Grove, it's pretty tough to find mittens that'll fit creature hands like yours. Get away from that TV set, Aaron. It'll invade your brain. - [TELEVISION] --19 years old. Studying-- - It's coming out of it. Don't you see it? - No. [TELEVISION] --to become an occupational-- It's touching Grover. Do you see it? I'm the only one who is touching Grover. [TELEVISION] --representing the city of Port Saint John. Let's go somewhere, Mom. You never want to go anywhere anymore, not even Shoppers. Grover's bad. Give him to me. No, Mommy! Give him to me. He's tainted. We have to get rid of him. [music playing] [aaron crying] Be quiet, Aaron. Stop the crying. Grover's not bad! You're bad! [aaron crying] [music playing] Aaron, I'm sorry for all the wrong things I do to you. I know it's hard for you when I'm ill like this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I understand, Mommy. [music playing] [car horn honks] Mommy, look what I found in the desk. [knocking at the door] Just a minute, Mom. [knocking at the door] Coming. [sound of the door opening] STUART SINGER: Hello, Aaron. AARON GIBSON: Hi, Stuart. STUART SINGER: You ready? AARON GIBSON: No. STUART SINGER: Why not? AARON GIBSON: I don't want to go today. STUART SINGER: Come on, Aaron. I've been waiting for you. I'll bring him back at five, OK? I need him. You can't take him. [knocking at the door] There's my big-eared friend Aaron. Where's your mother, young man? She in here? OK to do this now, Miss Gibson? It's OK, Mr. Obadiah. [foreign speech] Selling off the furniture? I'll give Aaron the money at the truck, save me an extra trip. Take care, Miss Gibson. Come on, Aaron. No. It is my right to see my son. Go get the money from Mr. Obadiah. You can go with your dad. This can't be good for Aaron. You go back into the hospital, and I'm going to ask for custody. We both know I'll win. [music playing] Don't worry. Lady Baby's just tired. She gets like this sometimes. [sighs] She needs a couple of minutes. No, she's not dying. She's resting. See? You got to eat, Mom. Hello, my name is Aaron Gibson. Do you remember me? Can you come to our house? My mom hasn't talked to me for a long time. I need help. [FAMILY TALKING IN THE BACKGROUND] Mom, can I stay with Shirley? I don't think I have a choice, do I? It's what the lawyers decided is fair, Aaron, when your mom and dad divorced. But I never stayed with him before. [doorbell rings] It's Grandma Hattie. Say hello, Aaron. Hello, Aaron. Come on. [music playing] I'm glad you're here. [elevator chimes] Good morning, Mrs [inaudible] WOMAN: It looks pretty bad. RECEPTIONIST: John Tannerson, please report to the nursing station for your meds. Gibson, Gibson, Gibson, where the-- It's on your left, doctor. Gibson, Gibson, Gibson. Yes. That's it, Mr. Racita. Just a couple more minutes. You're doing real well. [sirens in the background] Hello, Margaret. I'm Dr. Teplitsky. Hello. How are you feeling today? Not good. Not good. Dead inside the land of not. What are you going to do about it? Well, if I'm to be your doctor, I'll try and help you. I've had psych doctors from here to China since I was 15. What medication are you taking? Mellaril, Librium, Valium, Nidal, Percocet, Thorazine, Ativan, Ciclonal. You must have amazing tolerance. That would have snowed me under. Your head doctor on G-2? Yes. Do you lord it over all the other doctors that you're head doctor? No, but I do lord it over the patients. [inaudible] [silverware clanking on plates] What do you think you're doing, young man? We sit at the table. Me and my mom never do. We always sit on the floor. Sit at the table, Aaron. I want to visit my mom tomorrow. You're not big enough to visit on that kind of ward. Then I'll wear stilts. You heard your grandmother. [aaron sighs] You know, Margaret, you've been severely over-medicated for quite a while now. We've taken you off everything, but I'm going to prescribe one medication, Haldol. It's an antipsychotic. It'll help smooth out your thinking. That could be novel. Margaret Gibson? Yes? Sir, this is a hospital. Nurse. Custody? Stu-- Stuart, he's going to do it. Thank you, Doug. So what does the doctor say about how long you're going to be here? It depends on my progress. Can he really succeed at this? Well, he has taken the initiative, Margaret. He is trying to gain full custody. I breast fed Aaron. I toilet trained Aaron. I taught him the names of the birds and the trees and I taught him how to read and I took him to his first day of school. Stuart was never, never, never there for any of it! All right. Calm down. Calm down, please. - I had to do it all! The court reevaluates the case whenever there's been a significant change. With me here in the psych ward, it changes things? Well, substantially. Yes. Whether or not Stuart has been super dad, the court might find him the preferable parent simply because he has no psychiatric history. Now we've got to show you're going to be able to take care of Aaron, and we can't very well do this while you're in the hospital. Aaron's coming here to see the doctor. Doctor wants to see how Aaron's doing. Aaron keeps so much to himself. I worry about him. Margaret, the first priority is to get better and show whatever problem put you in here is taken care of. Now Stuart's chances are going to improve as long as Aaron's with him. The court doesn't like to shift children around a lot. What if they foreclose on my house? It's not the end of the world. Look, I'll try and contact Stuart's lawyer. I'll keep you posted. [car horn honks] WOMAN: Wait here. Nice bike. Stuart gave it to me. It's not even your birthday. I'm so surprised to see you, Aaron. But I'm really happy you're here. Does Stuart know that you're here? No. I made this for you, Mom. Oh, I love it. I can put it on my wall and look at it every night before I go to sleep. Let me look at you. A week seems like a year. New sweater? Stuart. Hm. Woo! Help Grover to talk, Mom. Um-- [IMITATING GROVER] Oh, this chocolate is a scrumptious mud color. Well, Grove, you should have been quiet for a long time. I think it's because you're sad. I think Grove's sad because he misses you. [IMITATING GROVER] Mon dieu, I'm going to play big. No tears. Mwah, mwah. Whoa, whoa. Whoa Whoa. Whoa. When can I be with you again, Mom? Sometime soon now. When, Mom? Soon. Soon as I can. Stuart says I might stay there for a long time. You and I are going to be together again like always. I promise you that. We'd better say goodbye now. Your school principal called me at work, Aaron. What are you doing here? You know you need to be in school. [music playing] Get your bike. [music playing] [margaret crying] [typewriter clicking] MARGARET GIBSON [VOICEOVER]: I'm on the eighth rung of hell. [music playing] It was a family of secrets. My father was in a mental hospital. It was during the war. He was a Bombardier. He cracked up. They didn't tell me about it until I left home, but I-- I absorbed it all through my skin, you know, the-- the horrors of the war. He was a sensitive man, but he-- he frightened me. I used to mutilate myself when I was a child. My parents knew, but they did nothing. Ostriches, you know, head in the sand. My mother, especially, ignored me. I was the "it." I always told myself that if I ever had a kid, I'd let him know how special he was. The-- they never tried to get me any help until I-- I-- I almost died. I-- I-- I swallowed some poison. I don't want Aaron to die. Why would that happen? What? You just said you didn't want Aaron to die. Driven to it, I guess, by another ostrich. Do you think you're oblivious to what's going on with Aaron? Well, ma-- maybe. I can't always know what's really going on inside of him, you know? Maybe-- maybe I'm incapable, like my parents, you know, because I learned from them. The doctor said I shouldn't have a baby because he'd be schizophrenic. And I said, well, then I'll understand him. But sometimes it's hard to know. Maybe I'm hurting him. [music playing] And if they take my boy away from me because I'm an unfit mother, I'm lost. [margaret crying] Give yourself a chance, Margaret. That decision hasn't been made yet. [music playing] [margaret crying] I'm thinking of buying you a computer when you come to live with me. How would you like that, Aaron? I guess I'd like that. You guess you'd like that? Hey, you want to see your new room? Why did you and my mom get divorced, Stuart? Ancient history, Aaron. I don't have the best of luck with women. It's hard to explain. I left because she scared me. I had to get away. I didn't think you could live with a crazy person like that. I couldn't. No, me. Why? Because I couldn't handle her craziness. It wasn't easy leaving you behind. I loved you. My mom's not crazy. She's a lot of fun. [construction noise] Maybe I shouldn't have been so scared, huh? Oh, I don't know. Maybe you're a better man than me, sticking by someone crazy like that. My mom's a good mother. Yeah. Well, you turned out OK. You're pretty great. Only you still don't call me dad. I've seen a lot of progress over the last month, Margaret. Do you think maybe it's time now to leave the hospital? You mean because I'm on an even hum line now and I don't feel like a paper in the gutter anymore? Do you feel ready? I don't know. There's a safety in here. I don't have to pretend. More than anything, I want to be with Aaron. But I have to fight to keep him. I'm-- I'm afraid. Well, it's your call, Margaret. Does this mean that-- that I'm cured, Dr. Teplitsky? I disagree with your previous diagnosis. I don't think you're schizophrenic. You don't? Schizophrenia is a catchall name used for a cluster of mental disorders. Under stress you've exhibited certain symptoms that go along with the diagnosis. But you care about your life, and we both know you feel things strongly, powerfully. And you're in touch with reality now. Well, I know I've always been a little crazy. But you're right, I've always felt things strongly. Wh-- why would they say that about me? You mean I've never been schizophrenic? Well, I didn't know you then. I just know you now. And now you seem to be engaged with life. Well, if I'm no schizo, what am I? Well, some of your symptoms are found in any number of labels. Changing the labels won't change you. There are certain skills we can teach you to manage your life better, but only you can change your life. [music playing] [WHISPERING] Moogie. [music playing] --wants to see me? Who? She says she's an old friend. Hi. Hi. Uh, Aaron called me. If I had any idea what was going on, you know I'd have been here. I know. I'm-- I'm sorry I said what I said. That wasn't me talking. It was my madness. Well, you know, it's just that um, you never attacked me before, and I didn't know how to handle it. I didn't want to say goodbye to you. I know. People like us don't say goodbye. We just uh-- We just get interrupted. Aaron told me about the house. I put your name on the list for public housing, but I found a place. [car engine sounds] Does it have running water? I didn't ask. [baby crying] Oh, great. Stuart's going to milk this for all it's worth. Oh, this place would be exhibit A. Your honor, my only son lives in a rat-infested dump because his crazy mom's on welfare. Aw. I know it's the best you can do. There's more. More, yeah. Look, at least it's inside. I'll have to sleep in the living room. It is a bit of a dump, huh? Well, a few more paintings will spruce it up. Hm. What are you going to paint now that I'm not schizo anymore? Oh, come here. Outpatient and Child. Oh, Shirley. [knocking at the door] This is cheerful. Come here. Oh, I missed you, Moogie. You're the bee's knees, kiddo. Y-- you feeling better? Guess not. Well, better be off. See you next weekend, Aaron. [imitating a gun shot] Bye. Hey, no guns. [laughter] Oh! Oh! [laughter] I was only there for six weeks. I wasn't in a locked one. I realize that, Margaret. But a mental ward, the stigma, it's a factor they're going to exploit. Is it the factor? Primarily, yes. But Aaron's been absent from school quite a lot before you went into the hospital. Margaret, that's bad for us. You're going to have to keep him in school Hi, may I help you? Margaret? No, just a coffee, please. OK. I was on G-2 to get well. It does not mean I'm an unfit mother. I am functioning. Decently patched together, that's true, that's true, that's true. But the doctors would never let me out if that wasn't so. Margaret, any friends you have, anyone who can provide us letters to the court bolstering support for you as a fit mother we can attach to our affidavit. In the meantime, you have to remain on an even keel. The best thing for his side is to see you act crazy. No offense. Now Mark Perkins will be interviewing you, Aaron, and your ex-husband. Who's Mark Perkins? He's appointed through the Attorney General's Office. He's a lawyer who will be Aaron's advocate. Your assessment interview with him will be crucial. He's the one we have to worry about, Margaret. Also, he'll be interviewing you in your home. Oh, my God. When? I'll let you know about that and the court date as soon as I can. What are my chance chances? Well, I've had easier cases. In the meantime, I'd like to see you maintaining financial stability. Write, Margaret, write. I-- I don't remember how much you charge an hour. Don't worry. No, I will pay you. Margaret, listen to me. Family court can be slow to resolve these matters. Be patient. Be calm. Just take care of Aaron, OK? Since this is a special occasion, our first home-cooked TV dinner in our new abode, let's make a wish. [blows out the candle] What'd you wish? I wished we could move back to our old house. This is just temporary, Aaron, until I get back on my feet. Grove told me he wished that he lived in a real house like real people. He don't think we're real? I don't know. [imitates a buzzer] Wrong answer. You know, there are two kinds of real people. There's-- there's the kind that have a two-car garage and two kids and a lifetime membership in the Normal Club. And then there's the other kind, like us, who may not look so great from the outside and we may not have a car, like Stuart, and we may not have eaten at a dinner table in I don't know how long, that doesn't mean that we're not special and wonderful. You know, we-- we care about each other, you know. And that makes us real. You get my drift? Yeah. Sometimes real people, like us, can be a little crazy, and that's OK. A little crazy? I saw Duncan Miller today. He's our lawyer, remember? About my custody suit? Do you know what he said? He said, I could lose you. How do you feel about that? You don't want to talk about it. You keep to yourself so much it worries me. Mom, I feel like it was all my fault this happened. Why, Aaron? If I hadn't phoned Donald Culver, Stuart wouldn't have started the custody suit. I needed help. You-- you did the right thing. It's not your fault, you understand? Do you understand? If I can finish the book, does the contract still stand, Kenneth? Oh, thank you. Yes, I'm feeling better. Kenneth, would you-- would you write a letter to the court telling them I'm a decent mother? My ex-husband is trying to get custody of Aaron, an-- and they're sending an official guardian here to-- to scrutinize my fitness. Would you help, please? Thank you. You're a dear friend. Thank you. [traffic sounds] [typewriter clicking] [train horn sounds] How is it for you, being out of the hospital? It's like living in a glass house. I can't write anymore. Last night, my mind was an awful companion. Give yourself time, Margaret. You've got a lot to contend with right now. You're trying. Give yourself credit for that. I-- I need to get inside the skin of a word again. If I can't write, I'm sunk. I'm so worried about my writing that I can't sleep. I-- Isn't there-- there some sleeping pill tha-- tha-- that you can give me? Oh, I can see by your psychiatric face, that's inappropriate. Very. Well, every shrink before you would give me a pile of pills. I'm not a prescription clerk. So-- so while I'm lying there thinking that the official guardian is going to take Aaron away from me because I am the broken pane of glass in his life and I'm halfway to bedlam. What am I supposed to do, play auditory hallucinations until the neighbors start complaining? Don't lie in bed. That's just inviting trouble. I mean, you'll be lying there thinking, mirror, mirror on the wall, how crummy do I feel today? Get out of bed. And do what? Something. Well-- I-- I can't write. That's all I know. I don't have any hobbies. I can't turn my brain off. Well, try not to think. Do dishes, vacuum, bake. Bake? I can't cook. I've heard that these are not unlearnable skills, Margaret. You know what occurred to me in the middle of the night? What? That if I'm not good for him, I'd give him up. I have these crazy parts inside me no matter how quickly I try to amputate them, but I do want what's good for Aaron. Well, it must be painful to think that, but it sounds healthy to me. What, me giving him up? No. The thought process is healthy. Wow, healthy thought. Imagine what I might be capable of if I didn't have to take Haldol. I need to think to write. If I take the pills then I may be able to keep Aaron, but my brain turns to sawdust. If I don't take the pills, then I can write. But I risk going back on G-2 and risk losing Aaron. So what am I supposed to do? Without the medication, your symptoms could return. I'm not Margaret if I can't write. [margaret crying] [train horn sounds] [crickets chirping] Mirror, mirror on the wall. Egg. Egg. What are you doing, Mom? Aaron, uh, what are you doing awake? You're supposed to be asleep. You have school tomorrow. Oh, let's go. Let's go. Come on, back to bed. --All night in the unmade park after the railings and shrubberies, the birds, the grass, the trees, the lake, and the wild boys innocent as strawberries had followed the hunchback to his kennel in the dark. [music playing] I don't know anyone who likes Dylan Thomas's poetry half as much as you do. [music playing] Goodnight. Moogie. [light clicks off] [typewriter clicking] MARGARET GIBSON [VOICEOVER]: He was always a quiet baby, I was to say in the kitchen way as the years passed. You did not squall. You were like a lone and beautiful tree in a riot field of weeds. [typewriter clicking] Oh, something from Shoppers for you. Oh, my God. What? What is it, Mom? Uh, my writing application. I forgot I even applied. $2,000? Well, what do we do with it? What are we going to spend it on? Um, uh, should we buy food? Uh, pay rent? Uh, something boring and practical like that? Rent, Mom, rent. Or should we live? [laughter] [music playing] Aaron needs to play sports with other boys. He needs essentials he's not getting with her, decent clothes, for instance, food. I don't know where the money goes. I send them what I can. There's no food in the refrigerator. Oh. [IMITATING GROVER] This looks scrumptiously tasty, bright eyes. I think I look weird. You have a beautifully intelligent face, like Lord Byron. [margaret screams] [laughter] That's weird. Are you and Aaron very close? Yeah, sure. Not close like they are. I'm not nearly as indulgent as she is. You're the professional. Isn't that unhealthy, especially for a boy? Are you angry towards your ex-wife? A-- Angry? Why should I be angry? Well, except for Aaron's sake. Maybe because she's a freak. What do you mean by that? You know, is she warping him? [SINGING] Down by the bay-- [SINGING] --where the watermelons grow. [SINGING] Back to my home-- [SINGING] I dare not go. [SINGING] But if I do-- [SINGING] --my mother will say-- [SINGING] --did you ever see a fly wearing tie? [SINGING] Did you ever see a bee with a sunburned knee? [SINGING] Did she ever see a moose? [SINGING] Yes, and a goose. You are my heartbeat, Aaron. Hey, that's not in the song. [laughter] [marching in step] We will. We will go left, left, left, Right! MARGARET GIBSON: Left. AARON GIBSON: Right. MARGARET GIBSON: Left. AARON GIBSON: Right. MARGARET GIBSON: I'm glad we left, right? AARON GIBSON: What do we have left, right? MARGARET GIBSON: Right. Did you spend it all? It was dumb. It was dumb, I know. Beyond dumb. No, Aaron deserves to have something nice happen to him. Children need to have fun. Margaret, that's not the point. Don't you see I wanted to do something really, really, really exciting for Aaron? I don't know that I'm going to have another chance. I think I might lose him. It was wrong, I know, I know. Aaron, I made a mistake. From now on, we have to save every single penny. We'll turn your shirts inside out. What for? Because tomorrow is inside out day. We can save a lot of money on laundry that way. Um, oh. What are you doing, Mom? I'm unplugging the alarm clock to save on electricity. Maybe I'll save on some time. See if we're resourceful, we can survive. You're giving Stuart grounds for custody, Margaret. Not to mention it's bad for Aaron's development to be kept out of school. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm digging my own grave. Stuart told me that Aaron's been absent 16 days already this year. Aaron, the doctor wants you to go to school. It's important. I think Aaron needs to hear that you want him to, Margaret. Aaron, I want you to go back to school. We have to change now before it's too late. Aaron, do you believe your mother? I'm not going back. I don't want to go back Well, Erin, you have to. Otherwise, we can't be together. See, this-- this is my fault. I'm trying as hard as I can to cope, but-- but sometimes I need Aaron to help me come back down. You're too dependent on him, Margaret. Well, what do I do when I get scared and I need him? You say, I'm feeling rotten, but I want you to go to school. Just like that? You have no other choice, Margaret. I don't like school. Why? I'm bored. And I think there's more to this. I don't have any friends there. You won't make any staying at home. Maybe there's something else going on here. Are you afraid that if you come home from school your mom won't be there? You afraid that she might get sick while you're away at school, that she'll end up in the hospital? Is that what you're worried about? Maybe. [traffic noise] [IMITATING GROVER] Hey, bright eyes. Maybe It's time for Lady Baby to stop tagging along after you, aye? Maybe it's time for you to be a kid again. I am a kid, Grove. As a matter of fact, I'm nine. [IMITATING GROVER] Oh, too true, but growing up too fast having to take care of a crazy Lady Baby. I want to take care of you because you're such a special kid. [telephone rings] What? What? Oh, I'm sorry, Duncan. The official garden, yeah, um-- tomorrow? Tomorrow, oh, oh, my-- can't you delay them? Oh, my God. Um, what time tomorrow? Um, uh, yes. W-- uh, oh. Oh, I'm better. I'm better. Um, Y-- w-- when is the hearing? [margaret sighs] Yeah. Oh. Oh, don't do this. Don't do this. Would you please tell my son I will see him when he gets home. I'll tell him. I understand. Goodbye. Your mom said she'd see you when you get home. [music playing] [traffic noise] The tea will be ready in a minute, Mr. Perkins. Oh. Uh, Mr. Perkins? Oh. Oh, I had to repair that damn window-- that window myself. Um, here's your tea, Mr. Perkins. No, none for me. Thank you. How long have you lived here, Miss Gibson? Uh, six weeks. I've applied to the city for assistance and more decent size apartment. I've been on the list of applicants for some time now. Well, how do you intend to meet Aaron's material needs, Miss Gibson, other than through welfare? Is being on welfare sufficient reason to take my son away from me? Oh, no, no, no. But do you have an alternative to welfare? My writing. The Butterfly Ward won a Toronto Fiction Prize, and it made, uh, a pile of money. And I bought a house and lost a house because, well, among other reasons, I-- uh, the second book didn't sell. Among other reasons? That's a euphemism for going into the psychiatric ward of a hospital, but I went in of my own free will. And I got a good doctor, and he really helped me. I see. Miss Gibson, what kind of effect do you think your mental health problems have on Aaron? Oh, uh, Aaron understands. Aaron's a very special boy. He's not like any other boy. He just wants me well. In fact, he told me that I'm getting better. Really, he said that. And I'm good for him. In fact, Aaron once said to me, Mommy, living with you is a real adventure. So you're writing again? Yes. Yes, and I hope to finish this book, and then I can provide Aaron with all his material needs. What do you do with your son on weekends, Miss Gibson? Oh, we have fun. We play games. We go to movies. We troll for empty pop bottles to cash in, normal family stuff. [baby crying] Uh, sorry if I sound too flippant. My-- my friend Shirley, she is an artist and she says sometimes I sound too flippant. We like being together, Aaron and I. Aaron's poor school attendance is a serious matter, Miss Gibson. Yes, I know. I know that uh-- that-- that upsets me too, Mr. Perkins. Uh, but we've changed. I've changed. I really have. So Aaron doesn't stay home from school anymore to take care of you? No. No, he did when I was ill, but not now. Now I take care of him. Why do you think Aaron should live with you? Why? Yes, why? Because I love him. Thank you. I'll see you in court in three weeks. Well, see-- can you tell me what you think of me? I mean, three weeks is a long time to wait. I still have to meet Aaron. I haven't made any conclusions. When are you going to interview Aaron? Sometime next week. Thank you. Sometime next week. Sometime next week. [sound of children playing] Can I play? [sound of children playing] [children laughing] Leave, mama's boy. Why don't you put your mom's jewelry on? Shut up, you guys! [typewriter clicking] What are you doing home so early? [typewriter clicking] What's wrong? Nothing. What happened? I'm not going back to school. Aaron-- Aaron, you have to. Why can't I be here with you? Do you realize how close we are to losing this case? We ca-- we can't do this anymore, you know? We have to be less different now. You said different was good. Why can't I be different and not go to school? Because school is good for you. So we-- we can't give up. The hearing is coming soon. When? Three weeks. You have to talk to the official guardian first. What am I supposed to say to him? Just tell the truth. But meanwhile, back you go to school. [laughter] Get yourself an education. [laughter] So how do you feel about living with your mother, Aaron? Do you like it? Yeah. Well, uh, what's it like? She sees pictures in her head that I don't see. Oh, what do you do then? I tell her they're not really there. Is it an easy life? No, sometimes it's a hard life. Why? I mean, can you tell me why it's hard? She's upset a lot. And you? No, at this case. And your father, does he get upset? Mm-mm. Do you like living with him? Yeah, only I really don't know him too well. Uh-huh. [school bell rings] How do you feel about your mother's illness? What do you mean? Do you think she depends on you too much? I know she's needed me sometimes so she won't get sicker. Well, your father's got a good job and a nice house. 50 times nicer than me and my mom's. Only-- Only what? I just don't feel like me there. You don't have to take care of him, huh? I'm used to living with my mom my whole life. Well, you don't need to decide. It's a big decision. I'll try to decide what's best for you. Do you understand? [sound of children playing] Hey, Aaron, want to play? Me? Yeah, come on. Inbound it. Come on. Throw it in. [sound of children playing] [typewriter clicking] Aaron, where have you been? I thought you were dead in a ditch. Well, why didn't you call? Do you have any idea how worried I was? This is Herman. Hi, Herman. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Miss Gibson. Come on. Let's go. Ugh, this house is gloomy. So what do you watch on TV, basketball, football? Nope. Baseball? What then? Beauty pageants. Beauty pageants? [typewriter clicking] Mom? If I don't put Grover away now, I'll be sleeping with him when I'm married. [IMITATING GROVER] Well, as a matter of fact, um, I was thinking of taking in the beauty pageant on the creature planet. So it is a good thing you won't be lonely when I am gone. Take care, bright eyes. Wish me luck. [music playing] AARON GIBSON: Good luck, Grover. [music playing] The petitioner alleges Miss Gibson's diagnoses is paranoid schizophrenia. Would you agree with that, doctor? No, absolutely not. Since Margaret's been under my care, I have never observed that kind of pervasive disorientation, looseness in logical thinking, or delusional content that's usually associated with paranoid schizophrenia. I see. Dr. Teplitsky, in your opinion, how capable a mother is Margaret Gibson? I don't want to paint her a perfect mother, but she is very sensitive to Aaron and-- and concerned. And I predict the turmoil in her life will subside with ongoing treatment and the resolution of this custody case. Is Miss Gibson stable, Dr. Teplitsky? Well, it's a question of degree. She's much more stable now than before. She seems to be making remarkable strides in her ability to deal with stress. I'm just concerned how the psychological turmoil affects Aaron. Shouldn't the boy have a stable parent? I've found no evidence suggesting that Aaron is suffering. Perhaps there's more damage under the surface than you've been able to detect, doctor. The child has had to be the parent, from what I can gather. I think that's changed. Over the period of time that I've been seeing him, he seems to be getting more solid. Do you swear that the evidence you are about to give the court in this matter shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - Yes, I do. Mr. Perkins, what was your finding in the case before us? I must apologize. Usually this is the occasion for my definitive recommendation, but I'd like some more time to think the matter over, Your Honor. What is at issue here is whether or not a parent with a history of mental illness should retain custody of this child. We must determine what is best for Aaron. Although, according to the testimony we've just heard, she has made progress and is maintaining. Now should we risk keeping Aaron with her and possibly exposing him to traumatic events in the future should she have a relapse? I find this, personally, very difficult to decide. Shall we reconvene next week? Is that sufficient time for you to make a decision, Mr. Perkins? Yes, Your Honor. All rise. This court is now adjourned for the day. God save the Queen. What gives you the right to delay like that? JUDGE: This court is adjourned, Miss Gibson. Margaret, calm down, please. You're upset. - No. Margaret. No. We have to live with this. You have no understanding of how unremitting this is. A week may not mean much to you, but to us it does. Perhaps you're giving me the information I need to come to a speedier decision. - Margaret. Please, Margaret. - Oh. Margaret, you could lose Aaron. You could lose Aaron, and you can see him every other weekend until he is 18 unless you do something to help yourself. Use your strength instead of your weakness. Margaret, look at me. Look at me. You're a writer. Write an affidavit to the court. This could be your only chance. I-- [typewriter clicking] MARGARET GIBSON [VOICEOVER]: I've been mentally ill for periods in my life. But I believe now that with the help of my doctor and medication, the worst is behind me. I'm determined to give my son the nurturing he needs, and I know how to do that. One day, we saw a stuffed toy in a drugstore, Grover. I discovered I could imitate his voice. Grover saw us through many hard times. When there was nothing else, he was security, a friend, and love of which I had more than enough to spare. I cannot give Aaron fancy houses or new toys, not even always food. He has known hunger. Although, I've often given him my food. I can give him my words and words last. The only thing I can really offer him is unconditional love, no matter what. Mark Perkins has reached his recommendation. [music playing] And I concur. [music playing] [sound of children playing] It's you and me, kiddo. I knew it. [music playing] Moogie. Moogie. I guess a little madness is allowable? I have to make good now. Yes, you do. [laughter] [music playing] [applause] Uh, I started writing this poem a long time ago. Uh, I finished it yesterday. It's called Aaron. You've done under my skin dunning, a mad hatter tick-tocks six eight time, the human heartbeat pocket watch. My belly was puffed and stretched like a pale and fat oyster. My once trimmed ankles, water swollen. It did not matter. The days and nights of sitting alone in a cold flat, the window cracked like the jagged lash of a whip, would soon end. I, Margaret, was going to give birth. Then the cleaving, the the dunning, six eight beat stopped within my oyster parts and was held bloodied and close to my breast. You did not squall. He was always a quiet baby I was to say in the kitchen way as the years passed. He did not squall. You were like a lone and beautiful tree in a riot field of weeds. You did not hang out with the crowd of kids, but rather stand back a little to the side and wonder why they did not understand your jokes or who Dillon Thomas is. You do. It seems you always did. Once weeping, I knelt before you and cradled your soft, small head. I told you that I was sorry that I grieve for you, for me, for all the unright things I had done. Translucent hand then patted my arm. Two words, I understand. That made it all worse somehow. Now, at nine, you remind me to take my pills and to phone the doctor when I'm crazed. And always you bring my pill bottles, offering them up with renewed hope each time. Always I swallow the pills and say, now I will never be sick again. I fool no one. You are a lone and beautiful tree in a riot full of weeds, and you did not squall. [applause] [music playing] [cat meows]
