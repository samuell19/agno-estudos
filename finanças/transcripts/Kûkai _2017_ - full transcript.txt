Is the melon sweet? Who is it? It's me. May I have one? Are you looking for me? I'm over here. Come. I'll pay for my meal. There is… some money buried under that tree. Dig it up. It's yours. I'll be back. The master is home. Yunqiao. Chunqin. Come. I have to tell you something. What?! Did you really find the treasure? That sound… I have heard it in my dreams. In the 21st year of the emperor's reign… the Japanese monk, Kûkai, came to Chang'an… for an exorcism. How long has he been like this? He has not shut his eyes for a week. Please begin. Scribe Bai. Yes? Write down what I say. "The emperor died of illness." Write it down. Master Kûkai. The emperor's death must be kept secret. You can go now. And remember, you were never here. Oh, okay. Wipe your shoes. I had come here to cure the emperor's disease. But whatever it was, it was not ordinary. Master Kûkai. Scribe Bai. Why didn't you say anything? The imperial physician said that he died of illness. No illness… keeps a man awake for a week. I'm a scribe. My job is to maintain the exact records. I can't write anything I'm unsure about. How long have you been a scribe? Three years. Why? The emperor's pet cat is black, right? I haven't seen any pet cats here in three years. When I kowtowed, I got fur on my hands. Oh, yes. Only cat fur can be this fine and soft. What are you looking for? Pawprints?! Not only did a cat enter the palace, but it also went near the emperor's bed. Do you mean to say that a cat was involved in his death? What's this? "The emperor is dead. Now it's Li Song's turn." Who's Li Song? The prince. The next emperor. He will come back tomorrow. Who? The cat. We'll have to buy more fish. Nothing too big. He only eats the eyes. THE ONE WHO USES THIS WILL DIE That is part of the old palace. What's that noise? Be careful. It's just a cat. It's a time of mourning. Stay alert! Come on, let's go. Master Kûkai. Scribe Bai. You're right. There's a cat in the palace. Did you see it? No. The night patrol told me. I heard one more strange thing. Go on. Chen Yunqiao, an imperial guard, had a talking cat at his house. Where did you hear that? I heard his servants gossiping about it. Too bad. I'm leaving. Now it's none of my business. What about you? Are you going to report it? It's none of my business either. I'm done. I quit. I have retired to devote myself to poetry. I'm a poet. I've heard that Chang'an is full of poets. Well, I'm different. I could have been a high official. I chose not to. But why did you decide to become a scribe? That's also for my poetry. Only a scribe gets to stay in the palace. He gets to see the emperor's every move. Like a eunuch, minus the inconvenience. Are your poems about palace life? Yes. No more questions. I'll say no more. What's the poem called? The Song of Everlasting Sorrow. Oh. So, it's a love poem. I told you, I'll say no more. Who is it about? The emperor, right? That's why you needed to know him more. That's enough. It must be about his love for a concubine. Tell me one thing. Why did you say, "must be"? He didn't even choose his empress. Forget servants. Who else can it be? Very clever. You're too kind. You're right. It's about the emperor's love for a lady. -Have you finished writing it? -Not yet. When I finish writing it, I'll go down in history. But don't tell anyone yet. Was Li Bo the greatest Tang poet? Li Bo lived a long time ago. He was lucky. It was a golden age. Have you heard of Bai Juyi? He is the greatest poet of today. Oh, really? When are you going to introduce us? Bai Juyi is full of himself. He makes his own rules, lives for poetry, and meets no one. Hey, Kûkai. What about you? Why are you going back to Japan so soon? And what exactly was the reason for your visit? To study with Abbot Huiguo at Qinglong Temple. I couldn't even get my foot in the door though. Kûkai, it's not just you. Qinglong is the home of Tantric Buddhism. Huiguo obtained the Tantric secrets abroad. He says that no one from more than a thousand monks is fit to be his disciple. Melons, anyone? Melons! One melon can't feed everyone. So, I'll make some more. Oh, great! Now let's water them. Look. They're sprouting! They're sprouting. Did you see that? Grow now. Bigger. It's time to bloom. -Bravo! -Bravo! Did you see that? It's an illusion. They're real melons. We all can see them. We have all been taken in. -Bravo! -Bravo! Let's go. Gentlemen, would you like to buy a melon? I don't have any money right now. I sell illusions, not melons. You saw through it, so no charge for you. I'm sorry. But sir… only one melon was real, right? Impressive. Is that a Japanese accent? My name is Kûkai. Oh. It's an honor. Here is a gift for you. That's very kind of you. What's dripping? He got me after all. Toss it quickly! Now it has turned back into a melon. What a powerful illusion! Now I might believe in a talking cat. What was that guard's name? Chen Yunqiao. Hey, Yunqiao! Slow down! Well, the girls don't wait for anyone. Giddyap! Chen Yunqiao is the one in the middle. Here! Hey, girls. Where are you going? Come with us! Don't take my girl tonight! Oh, you all are here. -We want our bonus! -We want our bonus! Here! Where are they going? Huyu House. The city's top brothel. Are you still game? Of course, I am. -Hurry up, girls! -We're coming! -Yunqiao! -Yunqiao! Yunqiao! I am really sorry. My name is Yulian. Why haven't we met before? Yulian is new here. Sir. This flower is crooked. Let's go. Come on. You're mine tonight. Sister Lixiang. How weird. This is the Tang of romance! Aren't brothels forbidden to monks? This is a brothel for you. I'm here for the beautiful music. -Scribe Bai! -Yes? I got your gown back from the pawnshop. -Excellent. Pawn it again. -Sure. I see you're a regular. But for the first time, I'm here with a monk. It's you who looks like a regular. -It's for you. -Reward them! -Tips for all! -Tips for all! You danced beautifully, Yulian. Drink up. Chen Yunqiao. Who's that? It's me. Did you spend all the money? Do you want more? Come on, tell me. That's the cat. Yunqiao, your cat is here with your purse. I held this great feast for all of you… but what can I offer a mere animal? Here's a fish for you! I only eat eyeballs. You know that. Whose eyes would you like to offer me? Over there! It's up there! You, beast-- Yunqiao. Debts must be repaid. Listen up. I'll see you at home tomorrow night. My eyes. My eyes. Chunqin! What sort of monster did this? A cat. What is his connection to the cat in the palace? They're the same. Oh. Three heavy pawprints and one light pawprint. So, they're the same. But what does that mean? One of his legs was injured. Look at this, Inspector Li. You said that the emperor was frightened to death. Was it because of the cat? I'm sure of it. Then we wronged you… Scribe Bai. You didn't resign?! Fired, resigned, it's the same thing. A lowly official still has principles. All I said was that I would not record lies. Yesterday, they crowned the prince. Immediately after that… he became paralyzed. "The emperor is dead. Now it's Li Song's turn." The prophecy has come true. No emperor has ever had a curse before. Who can lift it? Kûkai is from Japan. He's a famous exorcist. Who better to take on the demon cat than him? Why would you do that to me? You're an exorcist. You want to get into Qinglong Temple. So, now you have got a good reason to stay. What are you thinking about? Why did the cat… attack Chen Yunqiao? He's the head of the imperial guards. What's their job? To protect the emperor. His family has been doing this for three generations. Oh, really? The cat said that… "Debts must be repaid." But whom was he talking about? What kind of debt… sees two emperors fall… and their top guard attacked? The palace?! Why are we here? You asked whose debt it is. Whose is it? One of the previous emperors, for sure. Is that so? But what's its connection… to Chen Yunqiao? Is the cat really coming back? That's what he told me last night. You brought on this disaster. You spent the money-- Chunqin! She's your wife. Will you save her? Help! Open the door! Yunqiao, help me! -Help me! -Chunqin! Help me, Yunqiao! How did you get here? You were not going to save me. Who are you? Is Yulian sick? She went into a coma. No, she was poisoned. -What? -What? Get some raw meat, quickly. Okay. Such beauty… is rotting like a dead flower. We don't have time for poems. Find a brush and ink. Let me stay here for the night. What's with all the Buddhist symbols? It's not just a symbol. It's light. Look. Here. -Is it fresh? -Yes. Give it to Bai. Give me a needle. Hold on to her. Catch them. What are they? Venomous worms. They poison living beings' flesh. Only raw meat can draw them out. Who did this to her? Someone who has a grudge against her. I'm sure it's Lixiang. Yunqiao was her lover. She hated her for stealing him. Not necessarily. The wine was meant for Yunqiao. He unwittingly gave it to Yulian. Master. Please… save my wife. "Her robes are like clouds, her face is like a flower." Careful! Where are you going? Chunqin?! Then who was that? An illusion. How did you find out? She cast no shadow. Only cats walk on rooftops. What poem was she reciting? It's by Li Bo. It likens beauty to clouds and flowers. When was it written and where? Come with me. What place is this? The imperial library. I think of it as my own. Over there. You lost your job, but you still come here?! Whatever. Push, Kûkai! Stop. What… A little bit more. Okay. Stop. "It was the spring of 755. Emperor Li was celebrating his beloved's birthday." Who was his beloved? The exotic beauty, Lady Yang. The Tang emperor… had 3000 women, but he only had eyes for one. Emperor Li adored her. He filled a giant pool with wine… and the hall with 100,000 flowers. Guests came from all over. He called it the Feast of Supreme Joy. Emperor Li ordered Li Bo to write a poem for Lady Yang. "Her robes are like clouds, her face is like a flower." Li Bo had certain principles. He used to write about common folks happily, but he always shunned the rich and privileged. This poem was the only exception. He wrote it at the Feast of Supreme Joy. When he first saw Lady Yang… that sight drove him to madness. Madness? Only madness! Only madness could inspire such a great poem. Li Bo wrote at the emperor's behest. The first line of the poem was… "Her robes are like clouds, -her face is like a flower." -"Her face is like a flower." Having seen her face… why would he only write about clouds and flowers? Oh, Kûkai. Hers was a beauty beyond words. It's poetry as romantic as her beauty and his love. Come. All great emperors wish to grow the realm and inspire awe. Emperor Li was no different. But that wasn't the real him. Daring to give up imperial glory for love… that was Emperor Li. He loved Lady Yang. He saw her as the soul of the dynasty. Often in my dreams at night… I live in those glorious times. In those dreams, I am also at the feast… where I lay my eyes on her. May I ask… how many poems did Li Bo write? He was a legend. Too many to count. Then why would the demon cat pick this poem? Whom was he reciting it for? What do you mean? It was for you. If you, like Li Bo, are writing about Lady Yang… your poem, the Song of Everlasting Sorrow, is about the emperor's love for Lady Yang. Am I right? Quality guaranteed! How much for one melon? Didn't I give you one already? Yes. It was delicious. So, what brings you here? Well, I don't get one thing about your magic. It's magic, what's there to get? They're just tricks, right? But a killer cat is no mere trick. So, I'd be grateful if you could advise me. What do cats have to do with melons? If a melon isn't a melon, then a cat… Isn't a cat! What is it then? Do you think melons appear out of thin air? Inside the illusion is reality. That means only the cat can give the answers to my questions. Thank you. Is this Yunqiao's house? Will I also end up dead and eyeless? Not yet. What is that supposed to mean? The cat probably knows about your poem. That tree wasn't there yesterday. Who's that woman? Isn't it Chunqin? No. Beware the magic! It wasn't like this last night. Hey! Gentlemen, come on up. Take a seat. There's tea. Kûkai… I hear tea is popular in Japan. You know his name?! I know your name as well. You are Bai Juyi. The famous poet of Chang'an. Indeed. The one who makes his own rules. Juyi, have you finished writing your poem? I told you she knew you were writing it. You finished it long ago… but you're not happy with it. And it's no wonder… because it's not the real story. Lady Yang didn't inspire Li Bo's poem. He met her only after he wrote it. Are you saying that he faked it? If it wasn't sincere… why would you recite it on the roof? "Her robes are like clouds, her face is like a flower." Lady Yang loved that poem. She said that to Li Bo herself. But didn't you say that they had not met? Oh, they had met… but only after he wrote the poem and threw his brush into the pool of wine. How do you know all that? I was there. Where? At the banquet. Which banquet? The Feast of Supreme Joy. Who are you? First, tell us about the injury. It's your back paw, right? Yes. I was Emperor Li's pet cat. We were supposed to grow old together. But when the rebellion came… he abandoned me, and fled for his life. What happened after that? After that, a cruel man buried me alive. But it wasn't my time to die, so I escaped. That's why you put a curse on him. He ordered them to bury me. I'm not done with them yet. What do you have against Yunqiao? It was his father who buried me alive. All of that happened 30 years ago. A cat doesn't live that long. I wanted to take my revenge, but then I ate a poisonous fish and died under the bed. My soul was trapped in my body… and I turned into a demon. Why did you use Chunqin to recite the poem? Why did you show us Lady Yang by the tree? Is there a secret you want to tell us? I shared her fate. Who-- Cat skin! Master Kûkai, thank you. Scribe Bai. How dare they play banned music! Lady Yang loved to dance. Emperor Li wrote this song for her. It was banned after the rebellion. Yunqiao! You brought on this disaster! It's your fault! Stop it! I want you dead. Kûkai! Save Chunqin! Kûkai! Chunqin. Chunqin. Don't bury me. It's cold down there. What? It wasn't me who killed her. Yunqiao? Reward! Reward! Don't tell me that was all an illusion. Yunqiao went mad. Chunqin is dead. Did you hear her last words? "Don't bury me. It's cold down there." When the cat said that he shared her fate… was he talking about Lady Yang? They tried to bury the cat alive. He was trying to tell us… that Lady Yang was also buried alive. Do you realize what you're saying? You say, "Don't let the magic fool you." But now you trust everything that cat says! This time, you fell for it… I didn't. Who said you could come in? The door was open. I had told you… Juyi doesn't receive guests. Why are you doing this now? The cat saw these drawings… and made Chunqin your vision of Lady Yang. From palace to brothel to Yunqiao's house, he has been guiding you towards the truth. But why me? Because of your poem. I understand that if Lady Yang was buried alive, then your years of toil are wasted. Oh, do you? You just get here, and you understand it all?! Spending cold nights agonizing over a single word! What do you know about my toil? What I understand is that you're Juyi. Even after 30 years… you're the only one who's kept Lady Yang in his heart. Her death has been recorded in history. The rebellion, Emperor Li's escape, the mutiny of his troops, he being forced to order Eunuch Gao to strangle her. You know… a scribe can falsify records. That's why I risked my life to steal the evidence. Oh, really? From the palace? Let's see it. Jade Girl was her baby name. It's a lock of hair. It was a token of her love. Emperor Li died years ago, leaving behind countless treasures. But his most secret treasure chest had only this silk pouch. Had he not loved her… he wouldn't have kept that lock of hair. You're also in love with her. You're as obsessed as him. I want justice for her. The dynasty's decline wasn't her fault. She shouldn't be buried alone. So, I'll do what Emperor Li could not do. I'll bring her back to life. But as you wrote… you have doubts. The demon cat is aware of this. That's why he is trying to tell you… that you haven't got the story right. I know that my writing can never be as good as Li Bo's. I'm happy to live in his shadow. But don't ever say that my poem is a lie. Speaking of lies… I lied to you about my identity. You're not a monk?! I'm an ordinary shaman. Japan's top exorcist was my master. But he was unwell… so he sent me in his stead. I'm here for the Tantric teachings. Kûkai… even after all these years… I am yet to find enlightenment. My mind and body still suffer. China has obtained… the Tantric teachings… to be free from the cycle of life and death. Kûkai… please… bring back those teachings. And so, I resolved to come here. Those were his last words. Master. Goodbye. The journey tested my pride and confidence. Aren't you afraid? My baby is asleep, so I'm at peace. The waves were pushing me down. I was terrified. I struggled to stay alive. Because of the fear of death, I forgot every prayer. But I'll never forget her words. Why couldn't I stay as calm as her? I survived… so I must seek answers in those teachings. I found a witness to Lady Yang's death. Back then, in the palace, I was Lady Yang's morning maid. Ask me anything that you'd like to know. Were you there when she died? Yes. The emperor gave the order. So, I wove the silk cloth that was needed for the execution… and gave it to Eunuch Gao. Did you hear that? What happened then? When they called us in, Lady Yang was already dead. So, you didn't see Gao strangle her. I couldn't bear it. I'm sorry. Even the emperor turned away. Then how did you know that she was dead? Captain Chen of the guards checked it. He held incense under her nose. The smoke didn't waver. That was the proof that she had stopped breathing. How did she look after death? She looked like she was sleeping. In fact, she looked even lovelier than when she was alive. So, it was you who wove the cloth for the execution. She said that Lady Yang looked like she was asleep. That's strange. If they had strangled her, then she would have been in pain. I don't get it either. Who was Captain Chen? I told you before. Yunqiao is a third-generation guard. Captain Chen was Yunqiao's dad, the instigator of the mutiny. I got it now. The cat attacks all those involved in Lady Yang's death. Then why did he spare the old woman? What? Hurry! I shouldn't have brought you here. Bai… who else survived the mutiny at Maweiyi? Catch. Did any of them escape? Chao Heng? Who's that? A Japanese, like you. A senior envoy. He lived here for a long time. Abe no Nakamaro? That's the one. Oh. He was at Maweiyi too?! Yes… but he died a long time ago. Because he was Japanese, there were no records about him in the archives. That's why I wrote, "To be completed." Did Abe have a home here? Yes. His widow, Bai Ling, is still alive. Hurry up. Oh, it's you again. And who is this? Pardon us. I'm Kûkai, a shaman from Japan. This way. Did Mr. Abe ever wish to return to Japan? He changed his mind at the last minute. He watched his ship sail, and he returned. And then… he returned to Chang'an. Why? Because of a woman. He didn't know if she was alive or dead. Did he ever find out? I never asked him that. He lived here for a long time. Did he leave behind a journal? Yes. He asked me to burn it. Did you burn it? No. Regretfully, I read it. That's how I found out… that he loved another woman. Yet you stayed back. Don't you feel lonely? HERE LIES ABE NO NAKAMARO Why don't you give me his journal? Maybe I can release his soul… and salve his troubled heart. Thirty years have passed. I still remember the first line very clearly. "I'm a heartless man." "I'm a heartless man… besotted with the emperor's woman." THIRTY YEARS EARLIER Today is her birthday. All of Chang'an is astir. Today, the emperor has come up with an idea… to allow everyone a glimpse of her. Her exotic looks… have won his heart. It's an enlightened age, and she's its pride and joy. She's its symbol. And all eyes are drawn to her. I am going to profess my love to her… at her birthday feast tonight. THE PAVILION OF SWIRLING PETALS Everyone is saying… that all of this is her idea. It's her vision of the Tang Dynasty in all its glory. What a marvelous woman! M'Lady, M'Lord wants to know if you like the red robe that he gifted you. Did you like it? Where is he? M'Lord. M'Lady. Please watch this. A tiger for M'Lord… and the flowers for M'Lady. I still prefer my cat. The illusionist was Yellow Crane, the realm's most famous magician. White Crane! I'm coming! I want to catch those flowers. Go! Hey! Hey-- How rude! There are no rules tonight! Here. Catch! I had never seen those two boys before. They were Yellow Crane's disciples. Red Crane and White Crane. So, there really was a cat?! You reek of wine, you don't wash, your robes are filthy! What are you saying? I'm cleaner than you. Get off. Li Bo… wealth and rank are yours at last. Who are you? What do you want? My name is Gao Lishi. His Majesty wants you to write a poem. About what? A great beauty. There are no beauties here. Sure there are. It's not so hard. No one tells me what to write. I can't do it. The emperor isn't "no one." If he tells you to write, you write. Take off my boots, and I'll do it. I only do that for the emperor. Lady Yang said that… at her birthday feast, all are equal. This was a test. Whatever she said is not true after all. Gao Lishi! Yes? You're disobeying her and the emperor. It's Lady Yang's hairpin. Don't touch it. What are you looking at? So, you're the Flying Cranes. Amazing. It's an illusion. It's nothing. It's just like, now you see it, and now you don't. Am I wrong? -No. -Give Lady Yang her hairpin. Keep it. Now you see it, and now you don't. Are you the older one? I am. Dad found him by the river… and called him White Dragon. Don't lie to Lady Yang. My dad was a gambler. He sold me to Master Yellow Crane. The master is my father. Wait! Look at me. I was an orphan. I was raised by my uncle. Living under another's roof… made me grateful and beholden. You're just like that, aren't you? Only as a pair are you the Flying Cranes. "Her robes, clouds…" Come here. "Her face is like a flower. Spring breezes, and there's dewy loveliness… that can only be seen at heaven's peak… and moonlight pavilions." And I'm done. No revisions? Not a word. What did you write? Is it good? See for yourself. It's time for my nap. THE PAVILION OF SWIRLING PETALS Bai. It's Li Bo's brush. The demon cat was right. Wake up! Lady Yang is here to see you. Thank you for the poem. I beg your pardon. Did I write you a poem? Which one is it? "Her robes are like clouds, her face is like a flower." It's beautiful. You're too kind. It's not that great. Anyway, I didn't write it for you. Of course, you did. If it was not for M'Lady, who was it for? I don't know… but I can't lie. Put on your shoes. Li Bo. You enrich our dynasty. "Her robes are like clouds… her face is like a flower." Why is it written on your back? Did he write this on his own or did you make him write it? -Your Majesty-- -Turn around. Now tell me. It was Li Bo's idea. Lady Yang loved it. Should I reward him? Yes, richly. Have him exiled… for life. And what about your poem? Should I give it to M'Lady? No need. Abe. Why are you here? To see me, I'm sure. We received your gift. It was very nice. No. That's not why I'm here. I know why you're here. But remember… at no time… will you find Lady Yang alone. We're bound to be together for eternity. Let's go. Our last guest is here. The emperor didn't kill me… but his compassion and disdain… slew me in front of my beloved. He had written something for me. Abe… this is for you. Guess what it means. "The greatest happiness… is to control others." That was his greatest happiness. The last one to arrive at the feast was General An. The emperor welcomed him… with a martial performance. He knew that General An wanted to rebel against him, but still, he made him feel special. He was the ruler of the world, and he was trustworthy. Above the fray. This is Yanqiu Gate. Ten days after the feast, General An rebelled against the emperor. At first, Emperor Li stayed put. But General An wanted Lady Yang… so they fled Chang'an. One hundred thousand people went with him. I'm still the emperor! During the escape, the imperial guards mutinied at Maweiyi. They said that only Lady Yang's death… would end the rebellion and bring peace. Eunuch Gao has returned. Open the doors. It's the head of Lady Yang's brother. Now Captain Chen wants Lady Yang's head. It's impossible! Then he can't promise his loyalty. Your Majesty. What is it? Try it… but it's unlikely to happen. Yellow Crane! M'Lady… can we have a word in private? You want to take me to Japan?! It's the emperor's idea. The rebels killed your brother. It's all my fault. If I go, they'll kill the emperor. But if you don't, they'll kill you. Abe. Yes? You've been here for a long time. It's time to go home. But not with me. Abe! Yes, M'Lady? Did you have… anything else to say to me? Toward the end of the feast, Lady Yang foresaw her fate. She was the glory of the dynasty. But in crisis… the dynasty no longer needed her. At Maweiyi… she craved all words of love. She knew that… as her death approached, they could be… the last. I understand. It's all in your eyes. I am content. The rebels had killed her family. If they had taken her or she had killed herself… the helpless emperor… would have been doomed. If she had gone to Japan… the rebels would've killed him. For the sake of his dignity and safety… she could neither live nor die. Are you saying that there was a third possibility? I have a foolproof plan… to save M'Lord… as well as M'Lady. Red Crane, lie down. I call this the Immortal Path. It resembles hibernation. I can put M'Lady into a deep sleep. One needle stops the pulse, breath, and heartbeat. It also fools the gods. Hence, it's called the Immortal Path. What happens after that? Well, she won't be breathing… but it will do her no harm. She will not age either. We'll seal her qi inside her body. I won't let him do this to you. Your Majesty. Your Majesty… look. Are you awake? Get up. The qi is not yet in full flow. He needs to rest for a while. M'Lord… it's the only way to save her. Let's say you put her into a deep sleep. What should be done next? Seal and bury the coffin. Wait until things settle. After that, open the coffin, extract the needle, and welcome her back. Will she feel any pain? No, she won't. My love. I'd rather see Eunuch Gao… take my head on a platter, than break… my vows to you. I won't let you bury her alive! My love… are you willing to do it? He was going to bury her alive. Yellow Crane put the needle in. Soon, she stopped breathing… and seemed to be dead. What are you going to tell Captain Chen? I gave him the white scarf that we supposedly used for the execution. But she has no bruises on her neck. Chen won't fall for it. Eunuch Gao, you do it. So… I'll be punished for her murder?! Well, you did it behind His Majesty's back. I did it for you, Your Majesty! I did it for you! The emperor convinced Captain Chen… that Lady Yang was dead. He was the real master of illusion. I said nothing. Are you saying… that they never planned to revive her? They tricked her into agreeing?! What other kind of death… would leave her so peaceful… with a heart full of love and hope? -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! -Long live Emperor Li and Lady Yang! She was buried… in an ancient tomb. All those who know about it would be killed. I am no exception. Only the cat would keep her company. If you are reading my diary, remember… to get to the tomb, you have to cross the drowned forest. Even in her last moments, she didn't know the truth… right? She knew. She saw his dilemma. So, she sacrificed herself to help him. If she knew that… when they said goodbye, then why did she give him a lock of her hair? Did she still love him? Maybe she thought that the true meaning of love… is to make the ultimate sacrifice. I should burn my poem. I want to visit her tomb. I want to know the truth. This is it. Come in. Who opened the stone door? Someone was here. Kûkai! They have moved the lid. What? The lid is askew. Give me a hand! Push! I can't look at it. I don't want to. Bai. Kûkai… maybe we were wrong. Maybe the Immortal Path was real. What are you doing? Give me the candle. Close the lid. You're insane! Close it. -Bai! -Kûkai! Kûkai! What's this? It's the blood from her fingers. She wasn't dead. She tried to escape, but she couldn't! That's right. She woke up inside. You're White Crane. And Lady Yang? Where is she? You got it… Kûkai. She knew it was a lie. But she didn't know that she'd wake up. She didn't know how long it would take to die. Is this you… and Red Crane? On the second night of the mutiny… guards took the emperor away. Red Crane and I escaped the slaughter and snuck back to save Lady Yang. M'Lady! Was she alive then? She's dead. The magic makes her look alive… but it can't bring her back to life. What do you mean? The master had said it can! You just have to pull out the needle-- He said that to fool her. Who would want to be known as her killer? Not even the emperor! That's why Dad invented the Immortal Path. How do you know all this? They were talking about it at Maweiyi Station. Yellow Crane! Talking about what? About how to trick Lady Yang! But… even you had stopped breathing. You can seal off qi for two days. After that, the person wakes up. I thought the wine… would prevent her from waking up. What kind of wine? The Immortal Path wine. I had prepared it myself. Dad put demon worms in it. Why didn't you tell me? I found out later. You visited the tomb with me! He's my dad. I couldn't betray him. You still came with me to the tomb. What do you think you were going to see? You're as evil as them. Get lost. White Crane. Whom do you have in this world… besides me? I have her. She will wake up. So, Red Crane never returned? White Crane… the Lady Yang we knew is dead. I'm as upset as you. How can men be so evil? I want to end this suffering. What happened after that? Please tell us. You needed raw meat. I know. I can't die. If I die, she'll have no one. Your spirit entered the cat. You'll never be human again. I'm fine with it. Once I entered the cat's body, his memory became mine. Suddenly… I heard Lady Yang's desperate screams. How did you get back here? Weren't you protecting Lady Yang? I was protecting her… but then, I got hungry. And there were no fish eyes to eat. Everyone thought that… he went blind weeping for her. He lied, but he knew the truth. You need to write that in your poem. Or else, I'll kill you as well. You've already killed so many. Many? Three generations… and I'm not done yet. Your final target is Red Crane. That's right! What about Lady Yang? Where is she? Is she still alive? Tell me! Is she still alive? She will wake up. How long are you going to lie to yourself? The melon magician? What does he want? He has invited us to the banquet. FEAST OF SUPREME JOY Just the two of you?! There will be more. That's Li Bo. Lady Yang might speak to us tonight. No way. Do you want to bet? Sure. It's Lady Yang's hairpin. So, you're the Flying Cranes. Red Crane. Are you still playing with magic? I knew it was you who took us back there. I wanted to relive that time. The golden era of the Flying Cranes. The Flying Cranes are no more. Yet Lady Yang is eternal. Is she still alive? Kûkai! I've guarded her for 30 years! No one can touch her! I know you hated me for leaving… but I've been with you all along. Do you see who that is? I laid out your body in a frozen cave… waiting for this day to come. That is all I ever wanted. I have no regrets. I haven't inhabited that body for years. White Crane… Lady Yang would tell you… that she's no longer in her body either. You can kill me now if you want. I knew that she was dead. I just couldn't let her go. I'm going back to Japan. Oh. What about the Tantric teachings? I found the greatest teachings of all in the story of Lady Yang. It's in the Song of Everlasting Sorrow as well. Oh. Did you finish writing it? I'm not changing a word! You wanted it to tell the true story. The emotions are true. White Crane showed us that. But he's not in your poem. He wrote it, I didn't. That's how it is. I'm off. For that alone… you surpass Li Bo. DAQINGLONG TEMPLE I tried going to the temple for the second time. To my surprise, the doors opened this time. Master Huiguo is waiting for you. He says you know him. Kûkai… Red Crane. So we meet again. Did you find the secret key to bring an end to suffering?
