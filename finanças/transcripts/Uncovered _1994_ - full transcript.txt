Julia Darro? Parcel for you. Fuck me! Julia! Darling! Julia, Max. Hi. I'll, uh, see you later. So, what's up? I want you to see something. What is it? It's a hidden inscription. Ooh! "Quis necavit equitem." Who-- I wish I could remember my Latin. Who did something or other to the horse... or something. Who did something or other to the horse or something. What horse? - The chess piece! - Oh, the knight! Who took the knight? Who took the knight! I still don't get it. No, me neither. But I'm sure it means something. Who covered up the inscription and why? We could have a great mystery here. You and your intrigues. Menchu, this could be a very important discovery. Relax, girl. Maybe Van Huys just changed his mind. Artists are always painting over their stuff. Yeah, maybe, but what if someone else painted over the inscription? Then you'd have a mystery. Let's do a stratigraphic analysis and find out. Have you any idea how much that'd cost? If we discovered a mystery, it would increase the price the painting brings. Think of the publicity. Be worldwide interest. You'd be famous. The Japanese love mysteries, don't they? A mystery? I love a mystery too. Uh, Julia, meet Paco Montegrifo, director of Claymore's auction house. Ah, the hands that restored the Reverte altarpiece. - Careful. Turpentine. - Oh, turpentine. Now, about the Van Huys. We're very excited about The Chess Game. Mmm. So are we. - Is there something I should know? - Not yet. Now don't be coy, Menchu. We're partners in this. Don't forget that I'm selling the painting. I have a right to know. All in good time, darling. Oh, Mick! You two are up to something, aren't you? You slut! Baby, what did I do? Ow! Who's that? - Lola, the wife. - Oh, Menchu. Now say good-bye to Senor Montegrifo. Good-bye, Senor Montegrifo. Can't wait to find out about your mystery. Do the stratigraphic analysis, but don't tell anyone but me the results. Great. Thank you. Listen, I'm gonna need to do some more research on the painting, find out who the people are, that sort of thing. Talk to Alvaro. Flemish painting is his speciality. I don't think that's such a good idea. Why? You don't still have your knickers in a twist over him, do you? No, of course not. So then whatever happened in the past doesn't mean you can't consult him... on a professional basis now, does it? And then fuck him for old times' sake. Cranach's Venus and Cupid... painted in 1531. An entirely new and surprising theme, which, in Northern painting of that time, was of an incredibly audacious modernism. Now, who can tell me what's new here? John. It's the first known use of a classical, rather than a religious theme in Northern art. Yeah, sure, that's right, but I'm talking about something else. Anybody. Marisa. Yes, Marisa. What is it that you can see in this painting that's new? Could it be that she doesn't have any clothes on? Exactly. She's naked. Or to be more precise, she's almost naked. In figurative art, eroticism appears as a relationship... between clothing and nudity. Cranach'sVenus keeps her hat on. If she were completely naked, all erotic tension would be lost. Okay, that's all for today. Thank you. Lights. I need some information about a painting I'm working on. Sure. Linseed oil, turps. Brings back old memories. Van Huys. Very good, Professor. It's called The Chess Game. Never seen it before. Never even heard of it. No, nobody has. It's been in a private family collection for 500 years. Menchu found it. She's bringing it to auction at Claymore's. Baby, you've hit the big time. You sure it's the real thing? Yes, absolutely. We've checked the provenance, everything. I just need some background on these people. Right. Well, this guy here, "Ferdinand Ost D," is probably Duke Ferdinand of Ostenburg. Ostenburg? Small, little independent state on the Franco-German border, swallowed up by Burgundy in the Middle Ages. "Beatrix of Burgundy." Duchess of Ostenburg. See? Burgundy. It was a marriage of two powers. Oh, she was married to the old guy. Well, older men make more sensitive lovers. Who's the good-looking one? He's more difficult. "Preux." Could be his last name. Word means "brave," "chivalrous." They used to use it a lot when they talked about Lancelot. He's a knight. Could be. I could dig in the chronicles if you like. Dig, please. Missed you. Isn't Marisa taking good care of you? Come on, Julia, give me a break. Can't we keep things strictly professional between us? It was different with you. I'm so sorry. I have to go. Don't you have any feelings about me anymore? You dumped me, remember? It's not as simple as that. It wasn't my idea. Can I just explain? Never mind. Why go into it? I have to go. You'll still do the research, won't you? Yeah, I'll call you as soon as I have something. Oo-hoo! Princess, you've changed the lock. I knew this would happen if you got a place of your own. Claymore's insurance company made me get a security system. I'm working on a very valuable piece. Look. I made the key code in your name: C-E-S-A-R. Give me a kiss, you brat. Ugh. - La-dum! - I hate you. - Shall I take it away? - No, don't. Look at me. I'm the size of a house. A house designed by Gaudi. All curves and lighter than air. I still hate you. What are you doing here at this hour of the morning? I was nearby. Just looking in on Udolfo. How is Udolfo? Dying, actually. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? I should visit him. Doesn't want anyone to see him. Now... for the dishes. Cesar, please, I can do that. Stop treating me like a child. But you are a child, darling. You're a mess. I've been worried sick about you. You don't even answer your phone. Cesar, come here. I want to show you something. What? You cleaned your room? No. It's a genuine Van Huys. But that's not all. The X rays revealed a strange cloud of pigment down here, but I didn't know what it was, so I ordered some infrareds. And look. It's a hidden inscription, do you see? It means "Who took the knight?" Until yesterday I thought it referred to one of the chess pieces, but then Alvaro said one of the characters was a knight. Alvaro? Have you been seeing him again? No. He's just been helping with the research, that's all. How can you do this to me? You know how I feel about him. I'm not doing anything! God. That'll be Menchu. We're going out to see the owner. Don't be cross. Bye. Did you and Alvaro exchange bodily fluids? Yeah, in a way. You did? He tried to kiss me. I sneezed in his face. Very good, Julia. I must try that one sometime. I'm not like you, Menchu. I can't just jump into bed with someone for the fun of it. You're wound up tight as a drum, darling. You need to get laid. How long has it been anyway? Wow. A castle. You never told me Don Manuel was this rich. He isn't. Not anymore. That's why he's selling the painting. Hi. Come on in. The old bastard's in a filthy mood, so be careful. Don Manuel, you remember Menchu, don't you? She's arranging for the sale of The Chess Game. What are you bothering me for? I've given you the painting. What more do you want? T old you he'd be difficult. Don Manuel, we've had some infrareds done of the painting. They show a hidden inscription. And who might you be? Julia Darro. I'm doing the restoration work. And what does this inscription say? Quis necavit equitem. It means "Who took the knight?" I know my Latin, Senorita Menchu. We need permission to take samples of paint from different parts of the painting. We want to compare the pigments to see if the inscription was painted over by someone else. The price would go through the roof if we uncover the inscription. That may be what's important to you, Senorita Menchu, but l-- Just let them get on with it. Why pretend we don't need the money? You need the money. I am dying. Don't be vulgar, Uncle. - Give me one. - No. Come closer, little girl, and tell me about this discovery you've made. Well, I think it's some kind of puzzle or game the painter was playing. I was hoping you might help us figure it out. I've looked at that painting almost every day of my life, and I never had a clue. Do you know anything about the people in the painting? They're my ancestors. Van Huys painted this sort of family portrait... that's been handed down from generation to generation... until now. Do you know anything about the younger player? He was a French knight named Roger D'Arras. So he was a knight. Uncle, don't! Mmm. An old man needs his little pleasures. You were saying about Roger, the knight. Burgundy and France... each wanted to bring Ostenburg within their borders. Young Roger was an emissary of the French king... sent to negotiate the takeover. But Ostenburg was absorbed by Burgundy. Of course. So I think it's safe to assume that Beatrix of Burgundy... had the greater powers of persuasion. Max! You stupid old fool! I think you'd better leave. He's not gonna be much good after this. - I'm so sorry if we've upset you. Max, what about the tests? Do they have your permission to do the tests? By the way, girlie, "Necavit" doesn't mean "take." It can only mean "kill" or "slaughter." So the real question is... "Who killed the knight?" "A layer of varnish separates the inscription from the pigment that covers it, "leading to the conclusion that the inscription was covered up... "after the painting was finished... and probably by another hand. " Who killed the knight? "Lady, the same dew... "that frosts the roses in your garden when morning breaks... "lets drops of blood fall in the battlefield... "like tears in my heart, "in my eyes... and in my arms. " Remember what I told you. It's professional! The man who wrote those lines was a young knight called-- - Roger D'Arras. - Not bad. But I'll bet you don't know who he wrote them for. - Who? - Beatrix of Burgundy. - The duke's wife? - They were lovers. But they were political enemies. That didn't stop them. - Someone else did. - What do you mean? They loved and lost. Somebody murdered the knight. Who killed the knight? I don't know. It's a mystery. Wow. I haven't been kissed like that in a long time. Julia, there's something I want to say. You've been practicing. Don't make fun of me. I'm being serious. Do it again. Now I remember why I fell for you. I just-- Can't we keep things meaningless between us? No. I love you. That's it. I'm going. What happened? What did I do? Princess, you've solved a 500-year-old murder mystery. I haven't solved anything. Of course you've solved it. Jealous husband kills wife's lover, covers up evidence. The duke killed the knight. Looks like an open and shut case to me. Why would the duke commission a painting that accused him of murder? You've got me there, princess. Do you know anything about chess? Chess? Why? Because I think the answer has something to do with the chess game. What gives you that idea? Well, when Van Huys painted it, he had the two men playing cards. Do you see? Oh, clever princess! So you think Van Huys changed it to a chess game after the event. After the knight was killed. T o make some sort of comment about the murder. T o point the finger at the killer. I don't know anything about chess. That's Montaner, the one we're here to see. He's the best player in Barcelona. That'll show the little punk. Hey, gypsy, wake up and meet your fate. - Check. - What happened? Little bastard turned the game completely upside down. Shh! Check. Did he do something stupid? Really stupid. He just gave away his queen. Check... mate. Pay him. I don't think this is the moment for us to talk to the master. Don't come back. Watch how you talk to a gypsy. Could be we've found our man. Who, him? He's a filthy street hustler. I wouldn't let him near the painting. He'd probably steal it. You want to know which black piece took the white knight. Yes. You'd have to play the game backwards. - Can you do that? - Yeah. I suppose I could. Will you? No. - Hey, I was saving that! - You didn't want it. It was stale anyway. Why won't you do this, dear boy? Because if you knew anything about chess, you'd understand that there are hundreds, maybe thousands of possibilities I'd have to go through. - Too tough for you? - No. Too boring. I couldn't care less who killed who... in some place I never heard of, whenever. Would 1 0,000 pesetas make it more interesting? Five now, five when you work it out. - What's something like this worth then? - It's none of your business. How do you price it? By the size? The weight? Don't touch it! Don't touch it! It's 500 years old. 500 years old! That's pretty old. Well, my dear, what do you say? Well, seeing as how it's so old, ten now and ten later. - What did I tell you, Cesar? Nothing but a greedy street hustler. Okay. Bravo! How long will it take you? I don't know. Half an hour, a week. It depends. It's very important. Can we call you? But I'm a greedy street hustler. I live here and there. I don't have a phone. Then you call me... anytime. I'll let you know. I think we've made an excellent choice. Don't you, Julia? Seems awfully pleased with himself, if you ask me. And he's got a lovely bum. Don't think you're quite his type, Cesar, dear. You think he prefers women with three chins? Say good-bye to your money. I don't think we'll ever see him again. Don't answer that. I'm not here. Why don't you stay out of her life, mommie dearest? Why don't you? Julia, It's Alvaro. I'm going crazy thinking about you. I meant what I said the other night. I love you. You have to give me another chance. Can we just meet up? Well, princess, you lied to me. What did you call it? Research? Well, it was research. Leave her alone! Julia, you don't have to explain anything to him. You stay out of this. What happened, princess? Nothing happened. I told a year ago, I tell you again. He's no good for you! How would you know what's good for me? Atta girl! It's my job in life, my darling girl. Don't you know that? Alvaro is a snake. Do you know how many other little nymphets he was screwing at the same time as you? If nothing else, think of the possibilities of disease. It was an intolerable situation. Yes, Cesar, it always seemed strange to me... the way Alvaro dropped Julia so abruptly. Whatever it is you're trying to imply, I'm sure I don't know. It was you, wasn't it? You did something to make him break it off with me, didn't you? - Did he tell you that? - Well, was it you? Oh, what a ridiculous notion! I merely told him-- - You told him what? - Oh, nothing. Never mind. What did you do, you interfering old bitch? Out with it, Cesar. Well, I merely reminded him... that the university has very strict rules... about their professors consorting with students, and that the dean happened to be a personal friend of mine. I can't believe it. You never even told me. Well, I'm telling you now. Sometimes I hate you, Cesar. Well, I'll always love you. Hello. Alvaro? Alvaro? Alvaro, it's me. Mm! You okay? I won't keep you long. Just a few questions. What were you doing here tonight? Alva-- Professor Ortega was helping me with some work. What kind of work is that? I restore paintings. I used to be a student of his. He seems to have been an interesting man. Was he murdered? I doubt it. Bathroom accidents are very common. Why? Do you know something I don't? No. Do you want me to order an autopsy? Were you emotionally involved with Professor Ortega? No. Princess! Sweetie, what is it? What happened? T ell Cesar. You killed him, didn't you? Killed him? What are you talking about? You know! I'm talking about Alvaro! Alvaro's dead? Don't play innocent with me! Oh, my poor darling. Here. You killed him! You killed him! You wanted to keep him away from me, and you killed him! I would never! Oh, no? Then tell me where you've been all evening! There. You see? I was only being naughty. It's all right, Rashid. Go back to bed. I'm so sorry, Cesar. How could l have suspected you? Tell me what happened? Was he really killed? No. I don't know. The police don't think so. It's just that I found him, and I remembered how angry you were. Of course you did, poor baby. I was such a fool. No. Don't say that. You're the only one that's ever meant anything to me. That's why I was so scared because I thought I'd lose you. I'm sorry. I'm not making any sense. Of course you are, darling. It was always the two of us, wasn't it? Against the world. No families but each other. Just us. You and me. And now you've grown into a beautiful, successful woman. It makes me so proud. But it also breaks my heart because you don't need me anymore. I'll always need you, Cesar. I'll always love you. I'm sorry about Alvaro. Truly. Do you know what time it is? No. It's after 3:00 in the morning. You want me to go away. Did you find the answer? I worked the game backwards. You want me to show you the last few moves? That's what you're being paid to do, isn't it? White's plan is to attack this area here, so white's first move is white knight to bishop four, threatening the black queen over here. So what does the queen do? She could move here or here, but that would box her in. So her best move is this. I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. I'll make it simple. One: black knight to castle three, threatening the white knight and bishop four. Two: white knight takes black knight. Yeah, but who takes the white knight? The black queen. Beatrix? She did it? You're wrong. That's impossible. They were secret lovers. Why would she want to kill him? Women make love to men for lots of different reasons. Maybe there was something in it for her. There was something in it for her. She expanded her family's power. Ostenburg was part of Burgundy. Roger was the emissary of France. France was a threat. She got rid of the threat. I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Okay. So now we're even. No. You owe me 1 0,000 pesetas. What are you looking at? Just checking. What? T o see if you got something stuck up your arse. You are such a-- It was on your doorstep. - What's so funny? - Nothing. I'm sorry. Come in. - He wanted to see the painting again. - Yes, sure, by all means. Don Manuel, we figured out who killed the knight. Was it her? How did you know? I've been poking around in the family papers, and I found a letter that Duke Ferdinand wrote to the painter. Van Huys? What did it say? I wrote it down. You read it. "l know there is no possibility of vengeance, Master Van Huys. "She, like me, is just a tool of more powerful men... "who want to erase Ostenburg from the map. "But I want justice, even if it's only for myself. "Even if it's only so that she knows that I know. I trust in your ingenuity and your hands. " So the duke knew that Beatrix had killed the knight. But he couldn't accuse her publicly. So he had Van Huys hide the accusation in the painting. Isn't it beautiful? Great art is full of wonder and mystery. You've made me realize... just how much I love this painting. If you don't go through with this sale, old man, I swear I will kill you. - Don't be stupid, Max. - Max can't help being stupid. Don Manuel, the inscription's down here. - Do I have your permission to uncover it? - Of course, little girl. The duke has waited 500 years for justice. You are finally going to give it to him. - Who is that? - Oh, he's my guardian. My parents died when I was young, and he brought me up. Why? Do you know him? He's... my brother. You never said you had a brother. Don't worry, Lola. He's not in the will. I haven't seen him in 40 years, and I don't mind if I never do. Cesar never spoke of his family. No, I don't imagine that he would. Shouldn't we do something? Uh, perhaps a little water. Will he be all right? Maybe. This time. Hey, guess what. Domenec solved the chess game. Clever boy. I knew we could count on him. And? The black queen took the white knight. You don't say! So Beatrix, the bitch of Burgundy, did the dirty deed. Yeah. Your ancestor. What ever gave you that idea, princess? I saw your brother today. How was the old bastard? I thought he was rather sweet, actually. Why didn't you ever tell me? It's a sordid tale, princess, not fit for your delicate ears. I'm over 21. Don't you think I could handle it now? Well, when I was a boy, my darling brother... caught me in a rather compromising position... with the chauffeur. And your parents found out? Your rather sweet Manuel told them. Anyway, they threw me out of the house, told me never to darken their doorstep again, and I haven't. Poor Cesar. I wish you'd told me. Why? It's not important, princess. I never wanted anything to do with their world. The only person I admired was the chauffeur. I do love you, Cesar. Do you mind terribly that I'm working on the painting? Darling, nothing could be further from the truth. Seeing it again has brought back the happiest part of my childhood. A part I'd completely forgotten about because the rest was so ghastly. Watch this. What is it? What's happened? Udolfo. He's not-- Gone with the wind. It's a question of principle, darling. I mean, why should the auction house have a higher percentage than me? After all, I found the bloody painting. I did all the work. Yeah, it was brilliant... how you discovered that hidden inscription. Forgive me, Julia. I'm a fool. Ohh. And I certainly didn't mean to demean your contribution. How could l? It's priceless. So what would you say "priceless" is worth these days? Well, I'm giving you one percent, aren't l? Are you? Funny. You never mentioned it before. Oh, didn't l? It must have slipped my mind. Well, I always meant for you to have it, darling. I swear. Two girls sitting together. Always a bad sign. Well, now it's three girls sitting together. My, we're sparkling tonight, Menchu. Are those new teeth? I love it when my friends click. Looking for stray talent, are we, darling? In the world of art, it's a never-ending quest. Eureka! Hands off. That one's mine. Mmm. Rough trade. What is it, Max? The old man has decided to take the painting off the market. What? No, he can't. He fell in love with it all over again. That's not my fault, Max. No? Well, then whose fucking fault is it? I am fucking ruined! You're ruined? I'm fucking more ruined. You can't blame Don Manuel for wanting to spend his last days with the painting. I blame you. Careful, darling. - Max! - Stop it, Cesar. - I'm really enjoying this. I don't know if l can let go. He's all yours, darling. Come, Julia. I'm taking you home. Aah! Ohh! - Are you playing games with me? - At the moment, I'm playing with myself. Did you leave this on my doorstep the other night? These are mine. Couldn't afford the kind you're holding in your hand. That's antique ivory. Hand-carved. Very valuable. So you didn't leave it? Can you set up the pieces the way they are in the painting? Sure. - It's only a bit of celery. A friend of mine died the other day. Police say it was an accident, but I think it might have been murder. And you think it has something to do with this chess game. Was he a white knight? What happens after the black queen takes the white knight? What does white do next? The best move I can see white making is this. He's positioned himself for an attack on the king. - What does black do? - Easy. Black pawn to knight four. Check. Now, white has no choice but to withdraw the white king. King to castle two. And then? Black queen takes white castle. Check. This was sent today. I'm really sorry about your uncle. I liked him. The police have arrested Max. Max? Why? They think he murdered my uncle. And so do l. You're just upset. I'm sure you don't mean what you're saying. Yes, I do. You don't know him. You don't know him like I do. How well do you know him? Me? Hardly at all. Do you find him attractive, Senorita Darro? No, of course not-- Well, you can have him. I never want to see him again. It is a pity about the old man. Yeah, I see you're all torn up about it. I have to admit, this could turn out rather well for me. If you're waiting for Lola, I don't think it's a good time to talk business. She's a bit on the distraught side today. Actually, I'm waiting for you. Lola and l have already spoken. Oh, you have, have you? You're a pretty fast worker. With the old gentleman's passing, Lola has become sole owner of the painting, and she'll be dealing exclusively with me from now on. Aren't you gonna honor your deal with Menchu? That doesn't seem necessary anymore. Now then, how soon can I have the painting? You can have it anytime you like. I quit. If Menchu's out, so am l. Julia! I was just calling you. Um-- What is it? Listen, I've just seen Montegrifo at the funeral. Don't tell me. I'm out. He made a deal with that bitch Lola. Yeah. I knew it was gonna happen soon as I heard the old man had croaked. He asked me to keep working on the painting. I said no. You can't do that. W-What do you mean? I thought I was being loyal to you. No, darling, finish the painting. Look, don't worry about me. It's your career. It'd ruin your reputation if you didn't finish it. Why the sudden change of heart? You went ape-shit the other night. Well, my philosophy is, if you're gonna get fucked, you might as well lie back and enjoy it. Well, what about Max? They can't keep him much longer. They've got nothing on him. Max didn't kill the old man. She did. Who, Lola? Who else? Come on, Julia. You're looking for this black queen. She's it. She plays chess. She even dresses in black. - She thinks Max did it. - Exactly. That proves she did it. She's pointed the finger at him-- Oh, baby, baby. Mmm. Let's get out of here, huh? Mm-hmm. Oh, Julia. Hi. Hi. No hard feelings about the other night, huh? Bye, darling. Could l-- lnspector, could I have a word? I was just about to ask you the very same thing. I ordered an autopsy on your friend, the professor. And? Death was caused... by... "a blow on the head from a blunt instrument, I knew it. Like the edge of a bathtub. " Oh. Sorry to disappoint you, but there's no evidence of foul play. Two people associated with the painting I'm working on have died in the last week, and each time I found one of these on my doorstep. Alvaro Ortega, Don Manuel Belmonte. You might be interested to know that we've also done an autopsy on Don Manuel. He had emphysema. He died of asphyxiation. Yeah? That's how emphysemics die. Two chess pieces are not evidence that a crime has been committed. What made you change your mind and do an autopsy on Alvaro? Well, you raised my suspicions, and then I found this in Prof. Ortega's apartment. He kept a record of his conquests. - He took all of these? - Mm-hmm. That's Lola Belmonte. That proves my theory! - Does it? - She was connected to both men who died. So are you. Hello. Senor Montegrifo? It's Julia Darro. Listen, I've changed my mind about the painting. It's almost finished. It'd be a shame to stop working on it now. Yeah. Yes. But I still think you're a son of a bitch. Bye. Max! What are you doing here? Uh, I was just in the neighborhood. Thought l'd... drop in and see how my painting's getting along. Okay, you've seen it. Now leave. You gonna fix me a drink? No, I don't think so, Max. I'm working. So, what do you think? Of what? Me. Oh, you've got to be joking. No, I'm serious. Didn't Menchu tell you how... good I am? She said you had a very tiny dick. Mmm. You know, I'd think being raised by a pervert... would've taught you all about the pleasures of the flesh. You've got all the qualifications. Fuck off, Max! Lighten up, huh? Do yourself a favor. Aaah! Look what you did to my face! Yaah! You bitch-- Friend of yours? He was just leaving. Hey-- I'm gonna get you for this. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just have to get back to work. Who's Mr. Muscles? One of the owners of the painting. Funny world you live in. I was thinking about the connection between the chess game and your life. There is no connection. It was all in my head. Both those men I told you about died of natural causes. So you don't wanna hear about what happens next in the game? No, I don't, thank you. Which one of you gave Max the fat lip? Brilliant, princess! Let's celebrate! Cesar, are you all right? You look odd. Oh, I just came from the doctor. Always an unsettling experience. Why? What did he say? Oh, nothing unexpected. You know what they say. After 50, it's just patch, patch, patch. Still at it, eh? Thought you didn't find this game particularly interesting. It's got all these interesting personal angles. Oh. Julia's told you about our 20th-century murder mystery, has she? Yeah. Come over here. I want to show you something. If we go back to where the black queen takes a white castle-- According to Julia's theory, that'd be Don Manuel Belmonte. Whoever. No, it's very important, dear boy. We're playing on a vast board, encompassing both past and present. The painter Van Huys, the Belmontes, Menchu, Julia, l, even you, Senor Domenec, may all be pieces in this game. All the more reason you should listen to me, seeing as how Little Miss Muffet over there doesn't even want to know. Logical next move for white... is to move its queen here... to defend the king. Leaving the black queen free to take the white queen. Exactly. Well, who's the white queen? - You are. - Who else could it be, Your Majesty? Bollocks. Who'd want to kill me? Your friend with the muscles looked like he wouldn't mind givin' it a go. - I can see how a man might be tempted. - The feeling is mutual. It's nothing, princess. Probably that rich fish I had for lunch. I should call a doctor. No. No, princess. Well, can l give you something? Just a kiss. But I want to give you something. Look in that top drawer over there. Look under the shirts on the left. - There are some bullets too. - This is ridiculous. Bring the gun and the bullets over here. This is how you load it. Cesar, I don't want it. Safety. Cock it. Pull the trigger. I thought you wanted me to feel better. Go on, take it. Good girl. Well, good night. Thanks for everything. - Is that it, then? I have to go. Hey, over here. Come here. Funny kids. Adorable, actually. Yeah. Little darlings. That's my wallet. Where did you-- The kids nicked it. How did you know? That's how I used to make my living, before I picked up chess... in a reformatory. Well, see ya. See ya. Your family must have been very poor. What? Your family must have been very poor... if they made you steal. That what my family do-- they steal for a living. What do yours do? They're dead. They're dropping like flies all around you. Maybe I can help. I have an aunt. She can lift curses. So you can laugh! Well, I never thought I'd see the day. What's the matter? Don't you think I have a sense of humor? I have a sense of humor. Aren't you afraid you'll get the curse? I meant what I said about the curse. It's like that inscription in your painting. It's there, but you can't see it. Oh, well, it's your curse. Oh! Hello? What? Where are you? Little shit! Just admit it! You went there to sleep with her! I went down there to see the painting! You don't give a toss about the painting! You went 'round there to fuck her! Baby, trust me-- Keep your filthy fucking hands off me! If you didn't fuck her, you fucked Lola. Yeah? What if I did? You fucked her. You fucked her! Yeah. - A man can't fuck his own wife? - Oh, you call yourself a man? A man? You're pussy-whipped. That's what you are. You're pussy-whipped! Pussy-whipped! Pussy-whipped! Pussy-whipped! You are just a broken-down old whore. Pussy-whipped, pussy-whipped, pussy-whipped. I hate you. We are finished. Ohh! Ohh! Julia-- Can I sleep at your place tonight? I can't bear to go home alone. I want to sleep on the floor, not on your bed. Oh, God-- Oh, God. "Little Miss Muffet." "Your Majesty." "Tight-ass." No sense of humor?

You finished it. I never really looked at a picture before. Never realized there was so much in it. Oww! What are these lines here? It's to show the difference between the original and the restored areas. There's hardly any difference. You must be a genius. Ow! Stop it. What are you doing? I'm making you even more beautiful. Look, this is me. Take it or leave it. You look so much better now. Oh, Julia-- Your hair looks beautiful. Give me a break. You make me look like Dolly Parton. What's that? Isn't that what you like? You think I'm fat, don't you? Aah! Where did those come from? Oh, my God! The painting! It's gone! - Menchu! Call the police. Call the police! "Queen takes pawn." Black queen takes white pawn. It doesn't make sense. The correct move should have been... black queen takes white queen. Julia should have been the next victim. Yes-- What? Explain this. I can't. It's like a mistake. Suppose we think of it as an accident instead of a mistake. The killer came here to murder Julia. Instead he found Senorita Menchu. Yoo-hoo! He kills her and makes off with the painting. Oh, my God! What's going on? Who's dead? Princess! What happened? - It's Menchu. - Oh, thank God. I thought it was you. Don't! I'm sorry. Just don't. I'm sorry. And what chess piece are you? Your guess is as good as mine, lnspector. We never seem to find out until after we're dead. Inspector, a neighbor saw a muscular man, around 30, wearing a gold chain and a yellow jacket. Max. Max Lapena? What about him? Well, he was seen entering the building at 9:30 this morning... carrying two jerry cans. Max and Menchu were lovers. They had a fight last night. That's why Menchu slept here. Now, this is a story I can live with. Chess conspiracies are hard to prove in court. Inspector. The chess game isn't over. It is for me. Inspector. I just think you ought to know, Max couldn't possibly be the killer. Oh, no? And why not? He's a Neanderthal. He couldn't possibly play the chess game. This chess game was giving me a headache. Now I have a suspect. I'm a happy cop. Hello? Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can. They've arrested Max at the airport. He wants to talk to me. He's refusing to speak to us until he's seen you. Why? He hates me. You found the painting? No. - At last, a friendly face. - Stay right there. Don't come near me. I didn't do it, Julia. She was already dead when I got there. Oh, really? How'd you get past my security system? Menchu was supposed to let me in. But the door was already open. What do you mean, she was supposed to let you in? - I thought you hated her guts. - Don't you get it, Julia? Menchu and me were in it together. The fight we had at the club was a setup... so you'd take her home. We were going to steal your painting. What are you saying? Menchu could never do such a thing. You don't know how badly she took all that business with Montegrifo. She'd already spent the money before she got it. I don't believe this. Menchu was my friend. Yeah. Yeah, she loved you so much she was gonna burn your place down. You're lying. That's why I had all that paint thinner with me. Mix it with the stuff you had at your place-- paints, varnishes-- it would've gone up like a bomb-- boom! You're lying! You killed her, you bastard! No! You killed her! Get her off me! Get her off me! Help! Okay! All right! I didn't do it! I couldn't kill Menchu. I was in love with her. Oh, cut the bullshit! Well, I liked her. A lot! Then who killed her? Lola? That's it. Yeah, she could've done it. I always thought she killed the old man anyway. She had the pills. That's a hell of a story, Max, but your wife has an alibi. Come on. No, I'm innocent. It-- It wasn't me! It wasn't me! You've gotta believe me! I believe him. I think Lola did it. Well, we're still checking out her alibi, but it sounded pretty good. I saw her. Where? Just before we found Menchu. I caught a glimpse of her car outside my building. A black Citroen. - Did you actually see her in it? - No. I told you-- - Did you happen to see a license plate? - No. Then go home... and get a good night's sleep. It's not Max, it's Lola. I don't care what that inspector says. Who's Lola? Lola's the black queen. Why should she make all the moves? - You say I'm the white queen, right? - No doubt about it. Well, okay, smart-ass, tell me what white does next. Set a trap for the black queen. Attack her castle. - Let me have the gun. - No. Shh. It's open. Come on. Max? Is that you? That's Lola? She's the black queen? Who's there? I know somebody's there! Look! It's the painting! Black queen takes white castle. Your move, princess. Cesar. It was you. That's me, princess. The old queen with the black heart. What have you done? Only what had to be done, darling. You killed Alvaro? He would have ruined you. I did it for you. And your own brother, Don Manuel? Ha! He deserved to die years ago. Anyway, that was for you. And you killed Menchu for me too? That was for me? That was an accident. But a very lucky one. She was about to set fire to your life. You're out of your mind! And Lola. What about her? I didn't really have anything against her. But that's for you too. What are you gonna do for me next? Kill Domenec? Kill me? No, my dearest child. I'm going to kill me. Well, go ahead! Do it! Good riddance! Cesar, don't! Why not? You hate me now, don't you, darling? With every fiber of my being. You'd never forgive Cesar now, would you? - Never. - Then why don't you do it? Don't tempt me. Stand up straight, raise the gun, point it right here. Don't do this to me! Do as you're told! Stop it! Don't speak to me like that! I'll speak to you any way I please! Now do it! No! Checkmate. No! He was dying, you know. I should have known. In a way, that's why he did this. He knew he was going to die, and he wanted to be sure that you would be provided for after he was gone. What's he talking about? The painting's hers now. Mine? The painting didn't belong to Cesar. That's the irony. It did. He was the last of the Belmonte line. After the old man and Lola, he was next in succession... and he left everything to you-- the land, the castle-- She's rich! Julia, you're rich! Ohh! What a horrible thing to say! Don't worry. No one makes money here. You've also inherited all the debts that go with the estate. So she's not rich? Poor as a church mouse. Oh, well. Easy come, easy go. Poor Cesar. "Quis Necavit Equitem." "Who killed the knight?" The Grand Duchy of Ostenburg, a strategically important principality on the border... between the warring kingdoms of Burgundy and France. Duke Ferdinand commissions a painting... to commemorate the visit of his friend Roger D'Arras, emissary of the king of France. Unbeknownst to the old duke, his young wife, Beatrix of Burgundy, seduces the gallant knight. This much is known to history. The rest is in the picture-- a tale of passion, deceit, of political intrigue... unparalleled in the history of art. The hidden inscription, buried beneath layers of pigment for over 500 years, unrevealed to the rest of the world until today. Come on. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I intend to start the bidding... You've heard this before. at 30 million pesetas. Let's go. Shh! Do I hear 30 million pesetas? Thank you, sir, in the second row.

Fifty-three million, ladies and gentlemen, for this magnificent picture. Fifty-four million! Thank you very much, sir. Fifty-four million pesetas. Thank you, sir. Fifty-five million. Fifty-five. Now, come along, ladies and gentlemen. Who'll do 55 million pese-- Thank you very much indeed, madam, in the third row. I've got 55 million pesetas. Fifty-six million pesetas on the table.
