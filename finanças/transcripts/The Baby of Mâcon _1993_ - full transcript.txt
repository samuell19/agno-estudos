It resembles me. It some would be necessary himself of a nothing for that I be his mother. There is only she that some drooled. You some will drool later for the holds. Is it heavy? Hold it well. It is for me! I want a child as him. Then, find you a husband. I want to be the mother of this child. In this city, you would do better to use you your own finger. Try mine, Danielle. Be not ungrateful, Danielle, you did not lack standards in this city. Spin! Spin! This is at my turn to play. I am the father. And this is more than a finger that served me! Done me to see my child! I have a boy. At last. See you, my medicines... ... my remedies do their proofs And they are for sale. I would know to play the father better than this crude fool. Maybe you could insist, Monseigneur, for that I hold the role? Nevertheless, there is not that my drugs. What possess you therefore that produces so miraculous babies? One can organize a demonstration. It is not anything else that a small dripping tail. His charlatanism does not be worth nothing. This is not him, the person in charge, but she. I would be even ready to exchange his ugliness against a child of go out it. You must show to my husband how to do. This is more effective if this is me that shows it to you. This is an imposteur... and the last person to take its own remedies. It knows that they are inefficient. Now that I gave birth to a son in so good health; It must be nourished as it is necessary. I want to nourish it! There is things, my child, that you must do for that it is possible. I want a son in good health. Show me this that you have for that it in be thus. Too small. Too big. Leave me to taste. Too bitter. Too soft... Too salted... Charity of roman, monseigneur. it is a curiosity that to see this, monsignor, rarer even to know. Too soft... Go there! It is necessary to this child as much of milk as it can some to drink. We should offer to him... a cow... a sacred cow. This is thereto that the cows are destined... ? No? This innocent one is the good one. Here the one that will nourish my child and will return his father to trust him. Look at this child. Not is it magifique? It will buy us the fortune. In a region where reigns such a sterility, this is a model. I am the wise woman that the put to the world, And now I feel my breasts to inflate. I am the wise woman that the helped to come to the world. And now I feel in my intestines the blood to go back. I am the wise woman that examined the placenta. And now I feel that I can populate the world. I am the father, and this child is a miracle... It is in my strength to sell you the success of the fertility. Thanks to me, you will become as fertile as the valley of the Jourdain... that the Garden of Paradise... Paradise the Sky. A day... when I will be married... I will take your remedies... And I will have a son as splendid as yours. Look at this miracle. Not is it magnificent? What did you undertake to rid the people of the misery? This Child will do miracles. Watch out, my girl. The art of the prophecy is not given to everyone. And that some thinks your son - him, the skeptical, follower of the new sciences? I heard to say that you faites to burn coal and heat water To do to turn wheels and return the fertile fields? Which miracle sort is this therefore? We does it give to eat? With your grimoires and your instruments ΅X that do you hope to accomplish... ...while we, the women, put to the world of beautiful children for that it becomes better? I think that you should do miracles before of you some to praise. Awaits to see, skeptical, awaits to see. We already see, my child. The mysteries of God are revealed. We do not more must have of these illusory superstitions when we can bring the proof of the divine miracles. Consequently, the Man can come to the aid of God in his writings. It is in effect capable of produce endless fire and light. We know consequently, that God does not have put the earth in the centre of any things. The sun is the centre today and it is the world which turns around him. and they think consequently that the creation of the Earth is previous to that of Adam. Adam really needed a woman to fulfil the work of God. The man does not make the children all alone! The woman either. The virgin Mary did not have requirement of Adam! You do not believe, that fact for the man and the woman to make of children is not a sufficient miracle? This was her. It can the being consequently. In here is evidence. Let me touch the head. Allow me to embrace it on the mouth. Give me a piece of the clothes. Cut me an end of its swaddling clothes. Allow me to touch his zizi baby. Your child can me to bless of his fecundity? That this child comes to spend a night in my bed to bless me. You can touch it. Be not afraid. Keep it in your skirts that it the warmth of tone can smell body and to bless you consequently. We have a phenomenon there. A mark of hysteria. An opportunity to be studied. - Your creed is called into question. - All this is only superstition. But if he had to fulfil miracles... your science would not be enough for it. It is a temporary miracle. A simple product of the flesh. The Church should look after to support creed out of the way wrong wonders and wrong miracles. And, my father, to lose also opportunity to make the good? With this child, my father, you could restore the reputation of the Church... ... and the ruins of your minster. Let this child touch lightly my hands. So that my bed is a place of duty and pleasure. You will be rewarded for it. We can help you. I am sterile. I do not have child. I am greatly in order tried hard to have as one of it. I exhausted my husband and taken by the lovers, put to bed with drunkards... ... and am humiliated to me in a brothel for soldiers. How I can persuade this child to help me? Allow me to touch it. Allow that I embrace his baby mouth. Gather his saliva that I can drink it. That my breast can accept it to bless my future. I shall pay you. I shall pay you every day. What have we therefore here? This child flatters my ambition. It is worthy of my beauty. He is an assistant helper of my good destiny. It makes of me a lady estimated, a virtuous woman, about which they speak cranement in the good society. I could be rich. This child flatters my ambition. He is an assistant helper of my good destiny. I could be rich. I could be rich. I could be rich. I believe, monsignor, that they will give me a role for some crowns. Have I your permission, monsignor? If they go to the point of entrusting you a role, what I doubt... ... we shall pay your costume. They will think that it is a honour. I could be rich. I could be rich. So only... Hotter than this! " I could be rich ". That this text is hollow! Be going to try me to drink. You so felt like to have the role, you would have paid them! What?

Then the Child will bless you to prove how much we are magnanimous. Blessed, my brother, the illness of this woman. I bless this work, she can be fecund. I bless this work, she can be fecund. And if I was sick, also. Bless me, my child, for that it is given to me to be fecund. It is not of me that I think... but be able this child to bless my girls. That you can give to the Child as a token of your thankfulness? Nothing. The child is generous but do not deceive us, because you have what to give. You have four girls΅X two can accept a benediction, ... and one of her owes prostitute itself in order to support my father... ... And other one must sleep with my father so that it goes on to amuse itself. Blessed, my brother, the girls of this man. I bless this work, she can be fecund. I bless... ... and the last must make nun and become the companion of the Christ. I bless this work, she can be fecund. Consequently you see what what is miracles! Miracles are of the spring of the Church. So that you can to benefit from it in person? So that the people can there benefit without favour no. This child is so nice, you do not find? Even you, can determine it. But it is your plaything, and you are his spokesman. It is the voice of God. Where is his mother? You resemble his mother so much. But where is the mother of the child? You resemble his mother so much. Where is the mother of the child! You resemble his mother so much. I am his mother. You are not married. Who is the father then? It is a virgin who gave birth. Impossible! My child, your naivety overtops your pride. The Christ is born of a virgin. It can again occur. Such thing does not exist. It is virgin. It cannot be then his son. Pourqui not? It already saw itself. Not since one thousand six hundred years. Examine me and me you would cover with shame. Have as you fright at learning the Truth? This child deserves better than your disdainful scepticism. My pureness will make ashamed all the incredulous women, and will make redden all the contemptuous men. I have never resembled in this, even when I was 13 years old. Yes, indeed, this child am still virgin. Yes, it is her. You could definitely withdraw one benefit of its lies. How can they believe you? See yourlself! I do not know that to search. So many years passed. Her anatomy is delightful. I am not persuaded of it. It is indeed what she pretends. I am not persuaded. Kind of old fool! We should ask in a more well brought up authority. Perhaps, monsignor, would you give us your opinion? That's true, I agree on it. It is virgin. I can assert it at first sight. I see a fecund country in spring, with dances and women who sleep in peace with their spouse. I see a fecund country in spring, with dances and women who sleep in peace with their spouse. I see two for us future the most audacious and the most eventful. I see two for us future the most audacious and the most eventful. I see distress all our enemies. I see delight all our enemies. I see glory. I see infamy. I see gold. I see death. We shall be rich. You will be poor. Joy will be mienne. Pain will be yours. And why not yours? Because I shall have died... What do you know about it? You are only a child. And what do you know about it? You are only a prince. Mother... You should not show you. You are sick and you must reside in darkness. Where is my son? They will laugh... ... of an old woman who sleeps still in the same bed as her husband. They will laugh at you and will say that the Child is not yours. For your good, it will be needed you always to refuse to suppose that the Child belongs to you. And my infant? We shall live comfortable for rest at present if you keep silence, kind of fool. If we want to thrive, you must trust in me. The child is vigorous, fear nothing for him. Hidden, you must remain hidden, because which would think that you are the mother of a saint? And my infant? You use your brother boldly You eat some white bread, wood of the white wine and you spread your legs on the corner of fire. You use it. The child goes very well. You take advantage from this child as a mackerel of a whore. Father, it makes the mackerel for you. You grope with a maidservant whom it paid you. Do you wish to lose this pleasure? It is necessary you to remain hidden, because who would think that you are the father of a saint? I am the father of this Child; he must learn my trade... This child is only an infant; you exploit it with atrocity. It is it which pays your pleasure. It is only a child! You can be silent, you are nothing furthermore that an existent milkmaid of a milkmaid. You could definitely use it. We drew you of the bouse... ... because my libidinous father develops a taste for your breast; you fell of the sky and we have you hired to nurse a saint. The husband and the spouse, the childminder and the whore. Incompatible prisoners between sheets... ... making war for ever. The world incarcerated in a bed. The husband and the spouse, the childminder and the whore. Incompatible prisoners between sheets... ... making war for ever. The world incarcerated in a bed. Incompatible prisoners between sheets... ... making war for ever. The world incarcerated in a bed. The world incarcerated in a bed. The world incarcerated in a bed. You, you do not believe in the power of this Child? I believe only in what I see. You tie too much importance in evidence. A too big number of evidence spoil the truth. Evidence served you for certify of your maidenhood. It means that sands of the desert cease being because you, son of priest, did not see them? Where nests your creed? I can think that there is some sand in the desert because knowledge trustworthy assert it. And I have knowledge trustworthy who maintain that miracles exist. There is also the weight of common sense, of observation and science. You cannot demand two things at the same time. You am is virgin and the child is not of you, that is you are not him and the child can be of you. Why can be? Because you can have stolen it. People think that this Child is mine and that he can make miracles. It is you who brought them to believe in these two lies. And you do not succeed in believing that consequently fields are fecund... ... and that they give birth in children as in a nest of honeybees? Coincidence. Coincidence? Or the activities of God have no report with you and with the child. You believe therefore in God? It is it big Scientiste. You are jealous of our success when requests of your father have nothing made against famine and misery. It is definitely evidence that this priest has no relief. Do you find the nice Child? Yes. Do you think I am nice? There is who say that you are him. And you, who did you say about it? Does not our success entice you? The effect which the Child produces on people does not it fascinate you? Why do not to hold us for an interesting experience? I would put on at your disposal if you wanted to notice me. You could experiment your scientific curiosity on me. I could even you prove that I am virgin. Incredulous, demanding an evidence as you are him, you should not really keep this proposal? First shrinkage. They say that he could have there a role for me on stage. And keep your silver for costume; I shall not need it, I am going to play my own role! Crop was thin, and are not it any more, The sterile animals... they increase. The spare orchards... they are fecund. The married women pray in their bed... ... and birth children am announced. To want to resemble in Virgin Mary, you blaspheme. The church is filled with icons from the Virgin to the Child. They added them creed. It is everything. You could join us. You could be Joseph. If this child is yours, you then already met your Joseph, and in the statements of all, it was deceived ΅X cocufie by God. I do not believe in your history of Immaculate Comprehension; if this child is yours, as you let it assume, it is because you ran the beggar-woman; and I would never have idea of marry me to a given away virgin. Alone this little finger stood, by curiosity of nuptial feelings. My father would never allow it. Your father! You are your own master ΅X wait not his permission. I get ready to accept the priesthood and thanks to his help I shall acquire a quick progress. Joseph, you are a hypocritical. I noticed you look at the childminder when it discovered its chest to give the breast to the Child. I noticed at you look me. If your conscience is flustered but that your wish is not it, I shall deliver you a secret that it do not need that you reveal. Come. Here is my mother, the mother of the Child, my brother. It is impossible. It is indeed not the mother of the Child. Yes. No. I shall never think that it is the mother of the Child. You still fool me. Idiot! This woman is my mother, and the mother of the Child is. Mother, say that you are the mother of the Child. Mother, say to us whom you are? No. Mother, say! Yes, I am the mother of the Child. You lie. How you can compel this woman to maintain that it the mother of your Child is while in obviousness she cannot the being? It is too old... too ugly too ill. You are a whore. It would take for me after miracle of think that she is the mother of the Child. Then allow me of you show one! Here is the place which I chose so that you make of me a holy mother, Joseph. You are madwoman and you blaspheme. That can very indeed to make you cursing? Since you are the mother of this child ΅X and that there is not legitimate father ΅X this makes a whore of you... You are a blind person and an idiot... double of a pathetic good scientiste. ... and you should be treated as as such. Agreed. Treat me as a whore... You will see me bleeding, and you will believe me then. And we shall be able to get married. I shall never get married to you... You exploit the young children. What do you make here? I came to see that you caused no damage. What damage can I cause? Do not pay for it attention, it is only a child. Embrace me; reflected in the fact that you can acquire by embracing me. Take my breast... ... breast which never have filled with some maternal milk. Because the infant is not taken out from my entrails, but of those of my mother. Uninterrupted, suck, taste my milk. You cannot it, because there is not. The Child is not mine. I am virgin. Now, look at the fact that you can have as you want. Now take me and your bollard will be covered with blood. In the name of your future offspring, protect my innocence... ... and character sacred of my birth. It is not you who must lose blood ΅X but it. Your blood is too precious΅X because who will believe you if you are not more virgin? Your pureness is the sacrifice that you must fulfil to succeed. Your success depends on it. You joined your maidenhood with my birth. It is that hushed up so use your power? To keep it can save you of violent death. You are not a favour, ΅X but a bane, and it is necessary that this animal dies. My sister, kill this animal. ... and, even me, who owes so much excuse you, would not excuse you. This animal is only a means. I am the message. Kill me. My son died and you killed it. It is the Child who is origin. It rejects responsibility on the Child! How a child can be taken there so that such event occurs? You are not worthy of being the guardian of this child. You enticed my son, and you slaughtered it. I am the protector of this child; the Child needs me. This child must be withdrawn to him This living being is not made to assure his ease. I am the mother of this child. You are not worthy of being his mother! This Child needs me, you cannot separate us. You are not any more the mother of this Child. I shall prove that this Child is mine. It needs me. Come, my child! You do not care about the Child but only of yourlself. It is in the Church to be in charge of it. That the Child decides! Come, my child. Ungrateful child! It is me who created you! You are my creation. The world is with your feet and venerate you thanks to me. Accursed you are for your ungratefulness and accursed are those which kidnapped you from me! They give me a role. Good blood, how much did you buy them? Nothing some crowns. I am going to play, guess who? You must be able to support pain. Me, I can support it, pain! Say to me my text. Ten crowns word?
