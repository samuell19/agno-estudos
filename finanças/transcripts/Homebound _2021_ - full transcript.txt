If you're not ready for this, you're not ready. We can turn around. If that's what you want. No. I'm being crazy. - You sure? - (Holly hums) I'm sure, I want to meet your family. I've always wondered what it's like to be part of a proper family. (lips smacking) But do you think that I should take this off? Just until I've met them properly. Of course not. For all I know, Nina's already told them. So you don't think it's insensitive and... It'll be fine. It will be more than fine, it'll be great. They're gonna love meeting their new stepmom. Stepmom? (laughs) Yeah. (door thuds) (birds chirping) (door thuds) (paper rustling) (door thuds) When was the last time you were here? Don't remember. Too long.

(Richard sighs) (ominous music) Where are you? Hm? (ominous music continues) (rodent squeaks) [Anna] This one's Jerry and that one's Lisa. Oh, they're very handsome. [Anna] Would you like to hold one? Yes. Oh, this is Dave. See how you get on. (rodent squeaks) (phone ringing) (Richard sighs) [Woman] The mobile number you've called is currently unavailable. (Richard laughs) (door thuds) (phone dings) (Richard sighs) [Richard] Fuck's sake. Holly! - Anna? - Coming! (rodents squeaking) (cage rattling) Holly? Holly? Nina's not here. She's not coming.

It's my birthday. It is your birthday and we are gonna have the best party with or without your mother. Uh, what are we gonna do for lunch? Man cannot live on fizzy drinks alone. (ominous music) (Richard gasps) You're gonna love this. (door clangs) Oh, don't run at them too much. Get back. [Ralph] Send it back, send it back, send it back. [Richard] Bring 'em back this way.

Uh... There's a door down the corridor. Wine's in the first room you come to, Holly.

(Holly hums) - You were great. - (ominous music) (stairs creaking) (muffled talking) (ominous music continues) (wine trickling) (bottle thuds) Oh yeah, this might be a terrible thing to say... I think Nina not being here is probably a good thing. It's like it was... It was like I could be how I used to be with the kids. (Richard chuckles) I wish to stay until Nina gets back. - Have some fun. - (ominous music) - All right? - Goodbye. (lips smacking) (ominous music continues) (soft moaning) (Holly laughs) (ominous music continues) (light dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (floor creaking) (dark dramatic music) (metal scratching) (birds chirping) (light piano music) (Richard groans) (leaves rustling) (birds chirping) How are you doing? Fresh as a daisy. And you? (hums) I'm not so bad. You're still here? You don't have to stay any longer than you want. Mommy will be back soon and it might be better for everyone if you went on your way. It's okay. I'm sure your dad wouldn't leave you. He already has once. I'm sorry, I mean wouldn't leave you on your own. We wouldn't leave you on your own. (mouth crunches) Hi. Hi. Anything you want? Have you eaten? Perhaps I could make you something. How about some eggs? (feet tapping) (range clicking) (gas sizzling) Morning, troops. Everyone behaving? (lips smacking) (Holly giggles) Okay, troops, who wants a swim? - I do! - Yeah? [Anna] Please! [Richard] Last one out has to lick my boots clean. Hey, what's the plan? [Richard] We're going for a swim. No, I mean with us. When are we leaving? Are we waiting for Nina or? (laughs) Bored of us already? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Lucia, you ready? Of course you're ready, born ready. (ominous music) (birds chirping) Ralph, Lucia! Let's go! What about me? Well, I'll see you down there. [Holly] Down where? Follow the tracks. Or enjoy the peace and quiet. Come on! Hurry up! - All right. - I'm not slowing down. [Richard] Come on, Ralph!

(ominous music continues) (house creaking) (leaves rustling) (ominous music continues) (paper rustling) (floor creaking) (door clicks) (light clicks) (ominous music continues) (door rattling) (phone buzzing) (suspenseful music) Hey! (Holly gasps) Jesus, Lucia. I only came to show you the way. We didn't think you'd find us after all. [Richard] Hey. - (water splashing) - Hey, mister. (Richard hums) (water trickling) [Richard] Only way to salvage the day. Oh. (hand thuds) (Richard sighs) Hair of the dog. (glasses clinking) (water trickling) [Anna] Aren't you coming in? Watch what I can do. (water trickling) (lips smacking) Hey, don't. Don't. (water trickling) Ignore them. They're just being teenagers. (lips smacking) Are you going in? Oh. Just watch.

(water splashing) What? Hey! - I'm gonna get you. - No! (Richard growls) (Holly gasps) (water splashing) (ominous music continues) (water splashing) (Holly laughs) Hey! (water bubbling) (water splashing) Stop now. (Holly coughs) (dramatic music) (water bubbling) (Holly gasps) (Holly gasps) (dramatic music continues) (water splashing) (ominous music) (flies buzzing) (wood creaking) (suspenseful music) (Holly coughs) (Holly gasping) [Richard] Holly, what happened? - Nothing. - What happened? It's nothing, I'm okay, just leave it. [Richard] Holly. - What the hell happened? - Get off me! What do you think you're playing at? - I said get off me! - Hey! Richard! Ralph, don't talk like that to me. You should be ashamed of yourself. Say you're sorry. Ralph! Say you're sorry. I'm sorry. All right, get out of here. (ominous music) (light dramatic music) (ground rustling) (branch thuds) (Ralph grunts) (ground rustling) (dirt rustling) (branch thuds) (Ralph grunts) (Ralph panting) (crow cawing) (ominous music) I'm a strong girl.

(ground rustling) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (birds chirping) (Anna sniffles) (crow caws) (birds chirping) (ropes creaking) (water rushing) (Richard sighs) What do you want to do? [Richard] Huh? Well it feels like things are a bit out of hand. (Richard sniffles) When did you last speak to Nina? Uh, not sure. Whenever I call the house she refuses to speak to me. Well what was the last message that you had? (Richard sighs) Nothing new. "Have fun, leave whenever you want. Kids will be fine until I get back". She invited us. I don't... Well, she didn't exactly invite us. I wanted to come. For Anna's birthday and to introduce you. I thought it would be nice. So you invited us. Holly (sighs). The thing about Nina, she can be tricky. Tricky. Well, we're not part of her perfect world. She probably wasn't ready to see us together. She's not here because of you- Me? It's because of me that she's not here. (Richard scoffs) Come on. No, it's just... It's... It's weird, I don't get it. I don't know why you aren't worried about her, about the kids. Do you think if I go she'll magically reappear? - No. - No, I... I want... I want to go home now. I want you to call Nina and tell her that we want to leave. The kids are old enough to look after themselves. - No, they're not old enough - There's no need to call Nina To be left on their own. [Richard] There's neighbors nearby. There's nobody anywhere nearby. This is just one of Nina's silly little games. She's trying to control us. - She wants to get back at me. - I don't wanna know. - Just relax, it'll be fine. - Richard, don't do that. Don't do that. [Richard] You like it. Well I like it when you're gentle. Please stop. Richard. (hands thudding) I asked you to stop. (ominous music) Lucia! Ralph! What the fuck were they even doing in here? (ominous music continues) Lucia. You can't just come into our room. - [Lucia] We were checking on you. - Why? [Lucia] We wanted to make sure you were okay. - Why wouldn't I be okay? - Accidents have happened in this house before. You don't know anything about us, but we know about you. I did say you should go. (light dramatic music) (handle rattling) (body thudding) (suspenseful music) (paper rustling) (ominous music) (phone buzzing) (suspenseful music) Holly? (ominous music) What are you doing in there? (door thuds) Sleeping? (light dramatic music) Anna! (door creaks) Hey! Anna! (light dramatic music) What? What are you doing? Why didn't you tell us you're married? - What? - Hey, hey. Infantry here. They... They're tr... - Richard! - Oh, okay. Hey! I thought this was supposed to be fun. (Richard chuckles) All right, what's the game then, eh? Anna. - Stop that. - Ralph. - Hey. - Get down. Anna. Anna. Stop it. Just stay calm, they're only playing. Say I do, say I do! - What? - Say it, go on! - I do, I do! - Richard! (sighs) Okay. (fist thuds) (Holly groans) That's enough now, guys. (Richard groans) - (Holly groans) - This is a sleeping bride. Wee, wee, wee all the way home. Just say I do. Come on, I've said "I do". All you have to do is say "I do". Don't take, I don't want to! Get off me! (elbow thuds) Holly! (Lucia cries) Ralph, untie me right now! - I'm so sorry. - (Lucia cries) Get away from me, bitch! Lucia, how dare you! Lucia! Why didn't you just say "I do"? They're only playing. Ralph, untie me now! (ominous music) Hey, you stay down here. - Richard. - No, just stay down here! [Holly] What? They were hurting me. Why didn't you stop them? Why couldn't you just say "I do"? - Let me, let me- - No, no, no. Leave her alone. What, what were they trying to do? Stop, it was a game. No, that was not playing. They, they... They don't want me here. Holly. They don't want me here. Why are you trying to make this about you? You just punched Lucia in the face for Christ sake! No, they were, they were hurting me. - I was trying to get - You're being paranoid. - them off me. - You're being paranoid! They couldn't hurt you, they're just kids. What, you don't believe me? Whose side are you on? Side? I'm not on a side. There aren't any sides. They've been alone! They've been abandoned! Can't you see that? (ominous music) (Holly breathing heavily) (ominous music continues) (leaves rustling) (ring clangs) (wind whistling) (leaves rustling) (door creaking) Lucia. Ralph's made us a pie out of the leftover goose. Very enterprising of him. Well, here we all are. Now everybody knows our dirty little secret, that we tied the knot. Toast to the new Mrs. Can... Can we talk about your mom, please? - I went into her room- - What'd you do that for? And I found this. So if anybody knows anything, if she was in trouble- - What kind of trouble? - Then wouldn't she want us to help her? [Richard] What the hell are you talking about? Lucia. (Richard chuckles) Anna? Anna, it's food. You're supposed to eat it. Anna! (plate clinks) Ralph. Ralph. What? Well it was, it was in her room. In a drawer in her desk. It's Nina's phone, isn't it? (chair rustling) (Richard gasps) Lucia? Ralph? (birds chirping) Anna? The three of you get down here now. All of you, against the kitchen wall. (Holly sighs) What's the meaning of this? We didn't ask you to come! Lucia, it's time now. It's time you told us what's been happening here. Where's your mother? What's been going on? We didn't ask you to come here! How dare you! Why's it any of your business? You left us! You fucked off! Why is her phone here? Why? [Ralph] This is our home! We don't want to go into a care home. What? Why would you? Ralph, where's your mother? Where is she? You drove her up the wall, didn't you? Knew you would. (ominous music) (light dramatic music) (water splashing) Richard, what are you... What's happened to her, Ralph? Where is she? (suspenseful music) Is she here? Is she watching? Nina! Come and stop me! (water splashing) No! (ominous music) (flies buzzing) Nina! Nina! (water bubbling) (flies buzzing) (Richard breathing heavily) (suspenseful music continues) (water bubbling) (Ralph gasping) Still nothing? Why are you playing games with me? I won't put up with you playing games. Nobody leaves this room until I found out where your mother is. Richard, just stop now. What have you done with her? (Anna cries) What have you done with her? Is this another of your sick little games, huh? Stop crying. (Anna cries) Stop crying! I told you to stop crying. Ralph, look... Look at your sister, huh? Where's your mother? Okay, you wanna play it like that? Anna won't stop crying because you won't tell me. You can stop this if you tell me where your mother is. What have you done to her? (suspenseful music) Richard, leave her. Stop crying. (gas hums) (pan clatters) (Holly grunts) Holly, Holly, Holly. Don't. Go, Anna! (door thuds) (suspenseful music) [Ralph] Come on! Come on, come on.
