You got it all. - Jesus, he's gonna be going to the bathroom any minute now. - Take a hike, Jimmie. - Just watch out for the staples, man. [laughing] - Ha ha, advice from the fat Don Juan. - Hey, at least I've had more than a magazine, dude. - Yeah, yeah I've seen her. A real K-9 cutie. - [Jimmie] What does that mean? - Hey, at least I don't pick up my girls from the dog pound. - Jerk off! - [Keith] Hey come on, you gonna give me one of those brews or what? - [Jimmie] No way. - Oh come on, you're gonna suck them all up by yourself? - Sure, why not, they're mine. - [Keith] Come on, let me have one. - What's it worth to you? - Well, I know where the Tri Delta sorority's having their initiation tonight. - Yeah, Felt-a-Delta? - And you just might be able to watch. I think that's worth a brewski or two. - You better not be jerking me around, dude. - Hey, it's all true, I heard it starts at midnight. And I've got the perfect window to watch. - What are they gonna do? - I don't know, but Babs Peterson's in charge. And you know she's gonna have them bending over. - I'd like to bend her over! - [Keith] You and me both. - This is gonna be great, man, let's go. - Calm down, I said it starts at midnight. - So, I got out the peanut butter, pulled out my gentile miss and did the deed. [rock music] - Babs, do I have to wear this hood? - Yes. - But why? I mean really, it's gonna make an absolute mess out of my hair. - Your hair is already a mess. It's part of the ritual, come on you know that. - Ritual huh, you make it sound like we're devil worshipers or something. - Well, maybe we are. - [Frankie] Come on, Babs. - This robe. It itches something awful. I can't imagine what it's doing to my skin. I don't see why we have to wear these things for some stupid initiation ceremony. - Rhonda, how many times do I have to tell you? It's a tradition, all right? The women at Tri Delta have worn these ropes for years. Besides, it's gonna put fear in the hearts of our initiates. - [Rhonda] I think you just like paddling girls' fannies. - Yeah, we'll just have to call her Babs the Dominatrix. - For sure, a pain freak. - You guys, it's a tradition, come on. - You like it too much for it to be just a tradition. - Really, what gives with you Babs? - Honey, it's better to give than receive. [laughing] Right? [girls imitating sizzling] - [All] Oooh. - Hey Calvin. You want in on this? Calvin? Hey, Calvin? - What the heck are you guys doing? - [Jimmie] You want to go? - Go where? - To the Felt-a-Delta initiation. - No thanks, I'm watching a movie. - Jeez, what a dork. - I can't believe this man, the guy's finally turned himself into a vegetable. We gotta save him. [people screaming] - What are you doing? - I'm checking for a pulse. - Come on, you can watch this crap any time. We got something better. - Not likely. - What's the matter, don't you want to see some cute babe's butt up in the air while Babs whacks on it? - Oh oh, sounds really enticing, Jimmie, really it does, really does, oh boy. - Last year there was this girl with great boobs. And Babs makes her wear a bra full of worms. And then do push-ups, deep push-ups. [laughing] - That's disgusting. - You're sitting there watching zombies eating people. That's disgusting, man. - It's not a zombie, it's a succubus. And anyway it's just a movie. - So, this is real life, it'll be great. - Look guys, sadomasochism just doesn't appeal to me. - [Jimmie] It's naked girls. [chuckling] - Well, that appeals to me, yeah. - Glad to hear it. Give him a beer, it can only help. - Um. [sighing] [laughing] - [Jimmie] It'll put hair on your chest, man, don't worry. - Mmm, mmm. [suspenseful music] - [Calvin] Hey guys. Uh. Wow. - [Jimmie] God, you're such a goob, come on. - [Taffy] What are we doing here? - We're joining a sorority. - Thanks for clearing that up. I mean why are we putting up with this? - You want to get somewhere in this college, don't you? This is the sorority to join. - So what? Who said humiliation is the only way to join a sorority? - I think it's supposed to build character and create a bond of sisterhood. - I think it's institutionalized sadism. [chuckling] - Initiates were not given permission to speak. That infraction will require punishment. Assume the position! [suspenseful music] - What is your problem, retard? - I can't believe it, he's drunk on one beer. - I'm not drunk. - Shut up. - Quiet. - Look at that. - Now, this is it, this is it. - Initiates, are you prepared to enter the Tri Delta sorority? - Yes. - I hope so. - Then let us begin. [suspenseful synth music] [initiates grunting] [grunting] [grunting] - Amazing. - It's fantastic. - Wow, what channel is this? - It's not TV, jerk. - We've got to get a better view. - I don't want to leave here. - Inside. We'll go around the back, come on. - Wait for the commercial. - It's not TV! [suspenseful music] [girls grunting] [paddle smacking] - [Keith] Shhh! - He's drunk on a can of beer. [paddle smacking] [girls grunting] - I think it's time for whipped cream delight. - Whipped cream? - That oughta cool them off. [girls squealing] [giggling] - Okay, up to the shower, then cleanup. And then we'll have the last part of the initiation. - Bye, girls. - Rhonda, come here. I think I'll be deciding the final part of the initiation, you understand? - This robe is murder, I feel like I've been initiated. Will you just just look at my hair, huh? So what's with the scare tactics, Babs? You sounded pretty evil back there. - I'll say, didn't you get enough of your jollies with your paddle? I mean, they took more than we ever got. - Honey, I haven't begun. [laughing] - Whoo, look out! You know, you really should consider prison work, babe. Brutal Babs, the Wicked Warden. [laughing] [upbeat pop music] ♪ Sex ♪ Sex - What do you think Babs has planned for us? - I don't know. I didn't like the sound of her voice, oooh, she gives me the creeps. - I don't mind the whipped cream, but I'm not gonna giver her another chance to whack me around. - We have to do what she wants or we won't get into the sorority. - I'm not putting up with any more torture from Babs. No sorority's worth that. - Look. We'll stick around and see what she has planned.

We'd claim self-defense. Three deranged rapists broke in our house. [laughing] - Isn't that a little severe? - Yeah, we were only looking. - And admiring. - Can she really kill us? - Don't be stupid. - And don't push your luck. You know, you're lucky the cops aren't here already, you perverts, - Yes, Madame de Sade. - I've just decided on the third part of our initiation. Lisa and Taffy. You're gonna break into the bowling alley at the mall tonight. And bring me back some kind of souvenir as proof that you were there. A trophy should do. And you three will join them. - What is this? I mean come on, you catch us breaking in here, so for punishment you're gonna make us go break in somewhere else? - Shut up, motorhead. We'll be alone in a deserted bowling alley with two frightened, gorgeous girls needing male companionship. - Oh hey, you know, let the punishment fit the crime. - Wait a minute, no way. - Alone with these sleaze bags? - Forget it, no not a chance. - Girls, it's a tradition. Either you do it or you're gonna find another sorority. - We don't have much choice. - Lisa, I'm not going anywhere with these sex maniacs. - I don't like it any more than you do, but please, we have to pass this initiation, oh please. - Oh no. - We'll do it. - Good, then it's set. You'll break into the bowling alley, you'll bring back a trophy here. Then you'll be part of the sorority. Well, for a probationary period at least. You better get going. [quirky orchestral music] Perverts. [girls chuckling] Rhonda, Frankie. - You've got more planned than you're letting on, Babs. I can see it all over your face. - Honey, did you forget? Daddy owns the mall. - That's right. - We can get in so easily. We'll watch our victims on the security cameras. And when they're not ready for it we'll scare the shit out of them! [laughing] - Babs, you're absolutely evil. - And, if Lisa and Taffy don't come back with a trophy, which they won't if I can help it, I'll think of some other kind of painful punishment.

Do you have a bobby pin? - Oh, who are you kidding, man? That only works in the movies. We're gonna need a crowbar, duh. - Oh, oh yeah, yeah, so we use a crowbar. We might as well invite the police to help us. - What about a burglar alarm? I mean a place like this is gonna have one, right? - Uh-huh. - Well I think I can bypass the alarm system with the use of a common coat hangar. - You say that in a movie, too. - Listen, Einstein, I don't see any bright ideas coming from you. Oh, we'll use a crowbar. - Guys. - Oh yeah? Saw a couple of movies and you're James Bond already, huh?

[laughing] - Poor girl must been desperate. - Dang, how'd that happen? Maybe I left a window out there and there's a draft or something. Whoo, dang. Well, better get out of here. [door rattling] Shit, it's stuck. God damn. [upbeat pop music] - [Calvin] Oh, I'm gonna blow chunks. [Calvin retching] - So, what now, oh master thief? [chuckling] - Give me a minute. Help me look for wires to the alarm. [scoffing] [laughing] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Jeez, this place is weird. - [Taffy] Did anybody bring a flashlight? - [Keith] Uh, no. - [Jimmie] It's a nice place for a murder, I'll say.

[thudding] - Ow, come on, that hurt. - Do that again I'll put a stake through your heart. - I was only joking! - Well, I'm not. Let's just find a trophy and get out of here. - [Lisa] I'm with Taffy, there's something about this place that gives me a bad feeling. - [Keith] What do you mean, it's just a bowling alley. There's nothing to be afraid of. [laughing] - This should be a breeze, they're spooking themselves. [laughing] - Okay, okay, look. The trophy case has got to be somewhere around in here. - You know this might go a little faster if we split up. - Okay, so uh, which one of you lucky ladies wants to go with me? - Uh-uh we'll go this way, you two that way. [sighing] - Poor girls, they just can't trust themselves with us. [Jimmie humming] [upbeat synth music] - Hi, do you come here often? - Jesus Christ. - Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. - You stay there pal, or I'll lay you right the fuck out. - Oh hey, I'm not gonna hurt you or anything. - Damn straight, you're not. You're no security guard. - Oh no, I'm just, um I'm just-- - That's close enough. - What's going on? - What is it? - [Jimmie] Calvin, is this is a friend of yours? - Sort of. [laughing] - Yeah, dream on, toad. What is this, midnight wimp bowling league? - What are you, the bride of Dracula? - Oh, jump back, prom queen's on the loose. Or is it high school hookers? - Well, this is Lisa, and this is Taffy. - Taffy? Jesus. - [Taffy] What's the matter with Taffy? - Oh, well if you don't know, Taffy, you deserve the name. - Anyway, Lisa and Taffy are being initiated into a sorority. - Oh, coeds, figures. - And in order to get into the sorority they have to steal a bowling trophy. - Oh, naughty, that's illegal. - Yeah, so what are you doing here, mopping up? - Yeah, and I'm almost done, so let's cut the shit and get out of here. - Maybe we should go. - Sure, let's grab the trophy and we're gone. - You know, you really shouldn't be doing that. - Times are tough, pal. - Calvin. You can call me Calvin. If you need any money I could loan you a dollar. - Hey shithead, I'm robbing the fucking place. Do you understand? - Yeah, sorry, I just thought... - Hey man? - Yeah? - Are those fucking glasses for real? [suspenseful synth music] - Come on, man. - I'm working on it, will you cool your jets? - Maybe we this is a bad idea. Maybe we shouldn't even steal this. - Shh! We're not stealing it, we're borrowing it. We'll bring it back and drop it off. Anonymously. - And besides they'll probably blame it on that bitch. - Maybe they'll blame it all on us. - Only if we're caught. Come on man, you're taking all night. - Shut up. Loo, I'm doing the best I can, okay? Damn it, it won't work. - [Spider] Hey, one side. - [Calvin] Gently, gently, gently. - Assholes. - You know, she's got a real attitude problem. - [Jimmie] Forget her. Well. Pick a trophy. Eeny, meeny, miny, ah. Oh, he's a big one. Let's do it. [suspenseful synth music] - They've got the trophy, we better do something. - Well what about that punk dyke? - I can handle her. [laughing] [upbeat dance music] - What's your name? - Spider. - That's neat. What's your real name? - Spider. - Oh. Come on, no one's parents would name them Spider. - I don't have any parents. - Oh, sorry. If you don't mind me asking, what happened to them? - I ate them. - Come on, Calvin, let's go. - Say goodnight to your girlfriend, Calvin. - You people really annoy me. Why don't you just leave the little jerk alone? Now get out of here and leave me alone. Or I'll stuff this trophy so far up fat boy's ass, you'll see it every time he opens mouth. - Let's go. Calvin? [eerie ambient music] - Too cool. - Ow, it's about time, too. [chuckling] - Holy shit. - No, unholy shit. - Babs, did you plan this? - I don't even know what's going on. - Oh baby, it was really cramped in there. It put a definite crimp in my style, too. [bones cracking] Ah, that's better. Well well well. Howdy do, boys and girls. Oh, your little faces are just so full of surprise. Well, I'm just as happy to be here as you are. What are you staring at? This ain't no freakshow. Oops, uh, old Uncle Impie's just a little bit cranky. It's no fun being locked up like that. Especially in a bowling trophy. - I don't believe this. - Are you for real? - Why, of course I'm for real. As real as you are. My my my, whose little girl are you? And another one, just as pretty. I'll bet all the boys are glad we have these pretty girls in the audience today. Aren't you, boys? Ain't you glad, boys? - Too cool. - Such a sour face. - Stuff it, you little prick. - Now is that any way to talk to your good old Uncle Impie? And just when I was gonna granted a wish to each and every one of you boys and girls. - A wish, who are you kidding? - Well, what kind of wish? - Why, any wish you want. Who's the sweetheart who sprung Uncle Impie from the nasty bowling trophy? - Me, I did that. - Hey, I did. - Yeah, but I picked the trophy. - Take turns, there's a wish for every one. - What a bunch of shit. - Uncle Impie will ignore that remark, but he'll remember it. Okay, Porky, you first. What can Uncle Impie do for you, babe? - I can wish for anything? - [Uncle Impie] Anything your fat little heart desires. - Wait a minute, Jimmie. - What for, what have I got to lose? - You don't know what you're dealing with. I mean, maybe the wishes can come true and then go bad on you. I don't know, I hear that's happened sometimes. [scoffing] - What are you talking about? - Maybe you better listen to Calvin, fats. - Thanks, Spider. - Maybe you should shut up, both of you. - Indeed, I'm shocked, shocked to find so much distrust from one so young. Don't matter to me. Either you want the rish or you don't. - I want it, I want it. - [Uncle Impie] Good! What do you want? - Don't, Jimmie. - Uh, gold, I want gold. Lots of it. - Then gold it is. [gold thudding] [laughing] - I'm rich! Thank you. Thank you. I can get my nails done I can do my hair. Gee, I could go out and buy a Porsche! I'm gonna get two or three Porsches, this is great. Do you see this? [laughing] - Nothing to it. - It's for real. - Oh my god, they're getting wishes. - Babs, we've got to get down there. - This can't be happening. I mean, how can this be happening? - Ah man, I'll get a Masarati, ah, no I'll get a Ferrari. A Ferrari and a Lamborghini, and then, [laughing] this is great. - I bet a I know what you want, four eyes. Come here, kid. I bet you want to pork that little bitch in the sweater. I bet you want to pork her butt from here to Pocano, don't you? - Yeah, that's for me. - You got it. [sexy synth music] - Hey. - Oh, thank you thank you thank you. - Mm-mmm! - Well, uh, yeah. Um, we'll see you guys later. - Keith, how dare you, Lisa don't go with him. - I've got a bad feeling. - How bad? - Real bad. In fact, maybe we should be-- - No leaving yet, the fun's just begun. [electricity crackling] [grunting] - Fuck, it's stuck tighter than an ant's cunt. [grunting] Best thing to do is not panic, there's nobody out there that can hear you. So just don't panic, just be calm. God damn it, I want out, let me out! I want out, somebody, god damn it! [light pop music] - [Keith] Easy baby, easy. - [Lisa] You drive me wild. - [Keith] Lisa, Lisa, wow. Uh, Lisa? - Oh, yes. So great. Oh, yes. - Yeah. Look, Lisa, whoa whoa. Lisa, wait, hold on, wait a minute. - Oh, yes. - Oh, Lisa, we gotta talk. - You're next. You helped get Uncle Impie out, didn't you sweetheart? - Yes. - Good, and what do you want to wish for? - I don't know. - Oh, it's hard, isn't it? So much to wish for and only one wish. Come here, baby. You're a pretty girl and I like you. Now don't tell the others, but you can have one wish now and one wish later. - Can I? - Would I lie to you? All right, isn't there something you always wanted and never got? - Well, all through school, I always wanted to be queen of the prom. - And it never happened? Oh shit, what a shame. But we'll fix that. [chiming music] Quit looking at me and turn around, you knuckleheads. A vision, beautiful, beautiful! [carnival music] - Am I really? - Am I really, am I really? I'm getting the hell out of here. - Go ahead, be a party pooper. You'll be sorry. - Eat shit! - OK for you, Uncle Impie will use all your wishes up. No fair sneaking and peeking. Come out, come out, wherever you are. [electricity crackling] [girls moaning] [groaning] [grunting] [upbeat electronic music] - Babs? - Another party pooper, can't have that. [electricity crackling] [grunting] - Shit, it's a trap. - Yeah, it's starting. We better tell the others. - [Spider] Damn! [suspenseful synth music] - My dress, what happened to my dress? - This isn't gold. This isn't gold! It's painted wood, it's fake. - What happened to my dress? - Oh my gold, oh my dress, oh boo-hoo-hoo. - What's the idea? - Boo-ya, joke's on you. [Taffy screaming] - I've had enough of this shit. - Street fighting, no fair. - Eat shit and die! - Come on, Spider. - [Spider] Damn it. - Run run run, Uncle Impie's gonna get you! Fun fun fun! [suspenseful synth music] [grunting] Have a nice trip, see you next fall. Ha ha, I crack me up. - Wait, wait. Remember what happened to Babs. - Yeah, maybe only because that little prick was there. - Yeah, but you don't know how powerful he is. He could have the whole place sealed off like that. - Only one way to find out. [electricity crackling] - Are you okay? - Damn it. Yeah I'm fine, forget it. [Jimmie screaming] - Jimmie? - Get away, get away from me! [screaming] - Who's got a quarter? - Oh, I think we can manage that, Rhonda dear! [laughing] [machine whirring] - Holy fuck. [Jimmie screaming] [Rhonda laughing] [grunting] [Jimmie screaming] Move! Move! [upbeat electronic music] - Oh no. Whoa. - The way you make me feel. - Oh, it's nothing like the way I feel. - Good, you feel it too. - Oh yeah. - Hold me closer. - If I moved any closer I'd be behind you. - Oh, you're so witty. - No no no, I stole that line, honestly. - So hot, oh and you're so honest too. - Oh geez. Oh my god. Wonder how the other guys are doing. [suspenseful orchestral music] - [Uncle Impie] And now one of our hostesses will demonstrate her perfect bowling form. She steps up, she wiggles her fanny. And, oh perfect form, lovely form. This could be a strike, it could be a strike. Oh no, it looks like it's gonna be a gutter-head. Well, thank you, fat boy, it's been a pleasure having you on the show. - [Calvin] Wait, I'm gonna heave. - Come on, you can't stop now, they're right behind us. Come on! - No, I'm gonna toss. [Calvin retching] - Would you hold the noise down? - [Calvin] I feel like I'm dying. - Not yet, you're not. - [Calvin] Spider, I thought we were gonna die. - [Uncle Impie] Yes, it's late at night in the spooky old mall. What can happen next? [laughing] Could be a boogie-boogie monster coming around the bend. [laughing] [light rock music] - [Rhonda] Taffy. Taffy? Taffy? Taffy. Taffy. Taffy. Ah, come on. - Keith. Oh, Keith. - Ah, Lisa? Oh boy, oh boy. Uh. Whoa, um, yeah. Wait, wait a minute. - Wait? What for? - Um, I think we're going a bit fast, just a bit. - We're not going fast at all. - Wait wait, whoa, what are you doing there, ow ow! [Calvin retching] - Come on. Sit, sit. Ah, shit. - Blanky. - [Frankie] Calvin, where are you? - Oh, shit. - Don't be afraid. It'll only hurt for a little while. I promise you. Come out, Taffy. Keep me company. Taffy! [suspenseful orchestral music] [hissing] You'll never be a Tri Delta girl now, Taffy! [laughing] [grunting] [suspenseful orchestral music] Taffy? That wasn't very nice now, was it? [laughing] - Why don't you die? Why don't you die? - [Rhonda] Maybe I'm already dead. [laughing] - We've really got to talk. - There's nothing to say. I'm yours. - No no, see, that's exactly what we got to talk about. Ow, oh, no. I think you're doing this because of some sort of spell. I don't think you would be doing this under normal circumstances. - Does it matter? - Yes, it does, it matters, it matters to me. And I think it would matter to you. - It doesn't matter. - Oh my god. - Keith, I have your pants. [suspenseful synth music] - Find a weapon. What am I supposed to do, clean her to death? Come on! This ought to do it. Wonder what they clean with this. [grunting] - She's getting in. - Shit! [grunting] [gun firing] [grunting] - Holy, just like John Wayne, pow! - Yeah, right. - Yeah, that's beautiful, I never seen anything like it. - Would you just look for more bullets. Shit. Damn it. What does it take? [gun firing] Stay dead, damn it! [gun clicking] - That's not gonna stop her, let's get out of here. - I've gotta go. - Go? Go where? - To get a drink of water. - Water, at a time like this? - Did I say water? No, I mean ice, ice cubes, yeah. Lisa, Lisa. Have you ever done the ice cube trick? - No, what's that? [suspenseful synth music] - Ah, shit. Oh, fuck! Damn, sucker's gonna be the size of a donkey's dick come daylight. Guess I'll just have to learn to scratch my balls with t' other hand. Good thing I love my work. [light chiming music] [suspenseful synth music] [light chiming music] [sighing] - Darn, this is never going to clear up. [suspenseful synth music] - [Rhonda] Keith. - Lisa, is that you? Lisa? - Surprise, it's Rhonda. [Keith screaming] - Crispy critters. - Would you stop that? - Why? - It's giving me the creeps. What a sound. You shouldn't do that, either. - Who are you, my mother? - It's bad for you. - God damn it. How the fuck did I get stuck with you? - I wonder how the others are doing. Hope they're all right. - Let them take their own chances. First, we got to find some weapons. The snack bar, there should be some knives there. - What good are knives? A gun hardly slowed Rhonda down. - It's better than nothing. - What's funny? - Nothing. I was just thinking. The first time you saw me, you said "Hi, do you come here often?" - That's what Jimmie said you should say. - [Spider] He did? - Stupid, I know. - Yeah, it was, very stupid. [laughing] [sentimental synth music] How the fuck are we gonna get out of here alive? - [Taffy] Keith, thank goodness. Keith? Where's Lisa, is she all right? Keith? Keith? [Taffy screaming] [screaming] [laughing] - Got you, Taffy. - No, no! [bones cracking] No! [Taffy screaming] [Rhonda laughing] [bones cracking] [Taffy screaming] - Oh god. Oh god! [sobbing] What's happening? Oh god. - The rest of her is over here. - I think I'm gonna be sick. - You have nothing left to throw up. And we don't have the time to waste for you to try. Damn it, nothing here but plastic forks. - [Calvin] Sorry. - This oughta do it. [suspenseful orchestral music] - [Uncle Impie] Where are you going, my pretty? - Oh god. - Not leaving so soon, are you? - Damn you. - Already done, I'm afraid. - Who are you? Why are you doing this? What did you do with Rhonda and Frankie? - Please, so many questions. Let's take them one at a time. I'm an imp. One of the many imps to be sure. But not without certain powers and magical capabilities, as you have seen. Rhonda and Frankie have been made over into demons of a sort. Demonic stamina but without spell-casting powers. Inept, the both of them. My own fault for choosing such unpromising material. Coeds, really. [gasping] What I am doing is tormenting you. That is what imps do, goofy! And I do take pride in my work. [laughing] But then I pull the wings off of flies. - Please, stop this. - You don't understand. I have to do this, I must. - No. No. - A nasty lesson for a nasty girl. [laughing] - Hello, Babs. - Company's arrived. [grunting] [suspenseful synth music] [laughing] Uh-oh. - No, no! No! [ball thudding] - Yeah yeah yeah, oh beautiful! Oh, great. - Hey. It might not be over yet. Come on, let's check her. - Yeah. [laughing] - [Spider] Give me that. - Here. Is she dead? - There's no pulse. Would a demon have a pulse? - I don't know. Any other time she would have come up after us. You beat her. She's dead. One dead demon. [Babs laughing] - Hey, who's in there? - Lisa, is that you? - Come on. Come on! [laughing] - She's dead. Did you hear that? We can beat you. - What do I care, you're gonna take her place. [suspenseful synth music] - Let's find the others. [suspenseful synth music] - If a demon's in there, close the door fast. - [Calvin] Got it. - Do you believe this? [Janitor snoring] Hello? Hey, wake up, hey! Hey, hey wake up! Wake up, you old fuck. - Who's talking, who? What's going on, who are you? You kids shouldn't be in here, we're closed. - Oh yeah, no shit. - We're trapped in here. - What? - We're trapped in here! - Wait a second, I got to get this thing turned on, what'd you say? - We're trapped in, we're trapped in here! - Ain't no reason for you to yell, I can hear you. What do you mean you're trapped in here? - Just tell him the story, he'll love it. - Well, there are some demons that are murdering my friends. - Demons murdering your friends? I gotta tell you both, kids. Drugs are not the answer. What you gotta do you, gotta do like it says on the TV, you gotta learn to say no. - Hey, don't interrupt him, it gets better. - Well, I'll start at the beginning. It was an initiation, initiation? It was and initiation we had to help these two girls get into a sorority. To get in they had to steal a bowling trophy. - What, steal a bowling trophy? - [Calvin] A bowling trophy. - What bowling trophy? - It was a large one. It opened up. - You didn't open it up though, did you? - Well, I didn't, no, but, yeah, yeah it got opened. [sighing] - My god. My god, my god. My god, do you know what you done? You done let the imp out. - You know about it? - 30 years he's been in there and you let him out. [sighing] How many is dead? - [Spider] Three that we know of. - Well, two of the girls turned into demons and we had to kill one of them. And then one of them is still loose. And then there are two of our friends who are still missing. So... [sighing] - 30 years. - Hey, if you know something about this, you better tell us. Because that imp has this whole damn place sealed up. And the only way out is by dying. - Ain't lying. It was 30 years, I ought to know, I've been here that long. I've been here at this bowling alley almost all my life. - Here we go. - Matter of fact it was March, 1956. You see, there was a feller named Dave McCabe used to come in here all the time. He loved a bowl but he was just terrible at it, don't you know, I mean just awful. Every time he picked up the ball it would end up in the gutter. Well, folks they, they laughed at him and they they made fun of him. Then one day McCabe came in and he bowled a perfect game. And he kept right on a-doing it, every one of them perfect. Strike every time. He even won the league tournament that year. And that's when all the terrible things started to happen. Everybody who'd ever ever made fun of or laughed at old Dave, I mean even just a little bit, they started turning up dead, and I mean awful dead, all ripped apart. It was a terrible thing to see. - [Spider] Enough, pops. - Yeah, you're right, they did call the cops. And the cops figured old Dave done it and they took him away. Poor fella. He died that very year in the gas chamber, just two days before Christmas. - Sounds like an awful mess. - No no, he never did confess, no sir, right up until the very end he said he never done it. Said he used black magic to call up some sort of imp. You know, to help him out and be a better bowler and all, and then he said things just got out of hand, and this imp just starting killing everything in sight. - That is really the most stupid damn story I've ever heard. - No no no, it wasn't a bird, it was an imp, an imp you see. No, Dave told me that and I believed him, because I was there, I seen them bodies. Oh, it was terrible terrible terrible. - But how'd the imp get in the trophy? - What? - How'd the imp get in the trophy? - Oh that, well McCabe told me about that just before he got arrested, you see, he trapped him in there. It seems, an imp, when he gets trapped up in close places like that, he loses all these powers, you know like ol' King what's his name? Solomon, you know, that bottled up all the genies like you read about. - And you just left him on a shelf for 30 years. - Hey, I ain't gonna mess with no black magic, besides everything was fine till you kids let him out. [chuckling] - What are we supposed to do now. - What? - What are we supposed to do now? - Well, you trap him, like McCabe did, I guess. You do what ol' King Sol would've done. - Right. We just get him in a headlock, kick him in the butt, and put the little shit right back into the trophy. It really sounds like no problem to me. I'm sure you can handle it, Calvin. - I hear tell something about turning magic against itself, but I don't know how you do that. I think what you gotta do is probably get him in a headlock and kick him in the butt and then stuff the little shit back in the trophy. - [Spider] Great suggestion. - Well, at least we know what we're up against so probably the best thing to do is go find the others, huh? - Okay, let's do that. Now listen, I want you to wait here, you lock the door and listen for us please. - I'm sorry, I can't hear you. This dang thing's gone on the blink again. - Here. I said you wait here, lock the door, and listen for us. - Ah, still ain't workin'. I'll tell you what I better do. I think I better wait right here and lock the door and then listen for you. - Oh, great idea. Good idea, yes. Come on. [humming] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Oh, gee. What took you so long? I've been waiting. [gasping] [suspenseful synth music] - We haven't tried here yet. Shhh. [screaming] [suspenseful orchestral music] [groaning] Oh god damn she-demons, I hate 'em. Oh. - Shut up, hey. I saw a first-aid kit in the storage room. - Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Ah, she-demons. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. - Just come on! [eerie ambient music] - Oh, Babs. - No, Lisa. - No, Babs, please. - Time to continue the initiation. - Please, Babs. - Oh. Oh, nowhere to run to. - No, Babs, no! - Still wanna join the sorority, Lisa? - No. Babs. No, no, Babs. [gas dripping] - Calvin, hey. Calvin, hey, come on come out of it, hey. Come on. - What? What? What happened? - You passed out on me. - Oh. [groaning] Jeez. - Hey, it's nothing. It's mostly a bunch of blood. I found something when you were zonked out. Figure if we can't beat 'em to death, we can burn them. Now you're gonna do the lighting, I'm gonna do the throwing and we better get it right the first time. [sighing] Unless we find more bottles. Can you make it? - Yeah yeah. - My hero. - Do you ever say anything that isn't sarcastic or is it just some one of these habits you can't break? - It's a way of life. [ominous synth music] - [Uncle Impie] Oh. Where's miss lumpy-face? [laughing] - Maybe you better give me that lighter back. - [Calvin] I can handle it, see? - Yeah. - [Calvin] There. [suspenseful orchestral music] - Come to play? Bet you don't have as much as Lisa did. - Calvin, the bottle. - [Calvin] I'll get it. [laughing] [grunting] - Come on, honey. Just you and me. [grunting] [laughing] Ooh, I'm starting vibrate. [screaming] Come on. [grunting] Go ahead. Throw it. Throw it. [laughing] Ooh. Starting to enjoy this as much as I am, huh? - Not half as much as I will in a second. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, Babs. - Babs, how 'bout a cocktail? [screaming] [ominous orchestral music] [sighing] - Nice catch, nice throw. - Thanks. What a stench, huh? [coughing] - It's too bad we had to kill her. - Why? - I really liked the outfit she had on. [ominous synth music] [knocking on door] [hissing] - Goddamn that fuckin' imp. [grunting] - I found Lisa. - Dead? - Yep. - Uh. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Those look pretty mean. Want me to get a first-aid kit from the office. - No, forget it. I'm okay. Let's just get the old guy and get out of here. - You make it sound pretty easy. I mean, you still got the imp to deal with. [chuckling] - We'll just stuff that little bastard back in the trophy, "Just like ol' King Sol would've done." - Well, McCabe must use some mean black magic on him. - I don't know, I don't care. Let's just fucking do it. - All right. [sighing] Look all right to me. [door knob rattling] Still locked. - It's quiet. I wonder why she's not trying to get out. - I don't know. - What happened to your man? I wonder why he hasn't shown up. [eerie ambient music] Fuckin' didn't lock the door. [ominous orchestral music] - [Calvin] Oh shit. [hissing] Jesus. - [Spider] Fucking run! [suspenseful synth music] [hissing] [hissing] [hissing] [grunting] [ax thudding] [electricity crackling] [eerie ambient music] - Magic against itself. - Calvin, get the car. [suspenseful synth music] [engine revving] - Surprise. It's Rhonda. [gagging] - Monster in the backseat. The oldest trick in the book. [laughing] [gagging] [laughing] [gagging] [tires screeching] - No way out, except by dying. [laughing] [gagging] [chuckling] - Stuff it, you little prick. [gagging] [tires screeching] [car crashing] - Calvin! [light synth music] [groaning] Calvin, are you okay? - [Calvin] Wait, am I dead? - Not yet, pal. [grunting] [groaning] - The imp, where is he? - Over there. - That's what stopped Rhonda. The imp loses its power when it's trapped. - So it's finally over. - Come on, Calvin, we gotta go. - Why? - Someone must've heard this and the cops will be on their way. - Who cares? - You wanna explain eight mutilated bodies laying around? - The imp did it. - Yeah, right. You wanna open the can and prove it? Come on, you coming with me or not? - Where are we going? - My place. - [Uncle Impie] Here, where you going? Come on, don't leave me here. Let me out of here. Get me out of this can. I'll be a good little imp. I promise I will. Don't leave me under here. It's all dark and dank and musty and smells like tobacco. I'll be good. I promise. I'll be a good little imp, believe me. Hey, you in the front row. You got a wish?
