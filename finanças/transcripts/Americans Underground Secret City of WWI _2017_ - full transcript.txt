A new discovery. How far down, how many meters? Could... Xav, can you hold this for me, please? Merci. Yes. Ok. Ok. Ok, thank you. I'll be careful. You find a hole in the ground. And you crawl down into that hole. And you're in a different world. Oui. Yeah, I'm ok, Francois. I'm safe. I'm just amazed at what's down here. Wow. American photographer and explorer Jeff Gusky has entered a rare window into a war most Americans barely remember: World War I. To escape the terrible carnage on the surface, men on both sides took refuge in underground shelters like this, and they left their mark. There's a name, Louis Lefevre. L-e-f-e-v-r-e. Another name by Louis Lefevre, under this heart. It's a pregnant woman. Signs of humanity in a world gone mad. Jeff Gusky's mission is to document these long-forgotten havens hidden beneath the surface. In 1914, Europe, the middle east, and parts of Africa are plunged into a conflict, the likes of which the world has never seen before. World War I is the industrial revolution turned from the factory floor to the battlefield. It is mechanization, it is large-scale destruction, it is high technology of its day. Not just a war on the ground, but also a war in the air. All the great powers are drawn into this killing machine. Germany and the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires battle against Britain, France, Russia, Italy, and ultimately, the United States. The fighting is the most intense along the western front... A 400-mile corridor of trenches filled with millions of weapons and men. We all know the phrase of "going over the top" and going across "no man's land" into the battlefield. But what most people don't realize, even people who study World War I, there were these adjacent spaces where thousands of soldiers lived for extended periods of time. In this parallel universe below ground many of those men left evidence of who they were... Their own individual stories. In the 21st century, when few Americans are touched directly by war, our closest experience may be the emergency room. It may be a gunshot wound, it may be an overdose, it may be a pregnancy emergency, a psychiatric emergency, we have to take care of everything. Are you allergic to any medicines? No. Jeff Gusky's passion for a forgotten war grew from his work as a doctor. My job as an emergency physician is to save lives. We're on the front lines, just like in World War I, they were on the front lines. In my work as a photographer and explorer I was fortunate to find places that had history in the raw. His images from underground have captured a view of World War I few even knew existed, and where all sides contributed. When you go down in these spaces and you see some of these artworks, particularly the very personal ones, you really sort of feel like the souls of these individuals are still here. For Jeff Gusky, bringing to light these long lost souls has become a mission... One he hopes will deliver an even greater reward. Chemin des dames, an area of northern France. It means "road of the ladies." Jeff Gusky hopes it will lead somewhere else. For years, he's photographed French and German carvings. Hello! Hello, Jeff. Come on. Now he's heard of an underground city nearby that once housed thousands of American troops. They fought here in the last year of the war in trenches now largely vanished. Some friends of mine told me about this place, and they knew the farmer. Are you excited about this opportunity? A little bit, yeah. Jeff's friends belong to soissonnais 14-18, an association working with local landowners to preserve and protect the remains of World War I. One of them tells him about a hidden world beneath Francois Aubry's farm. Wow! That fought here. Wow. As many as 500 underground sites lie close to this 45-mile section of the western front, crossing the Chemin des Dames plateau. Both sides used them as troop quarters. In April 1917, the trenches here see some of the heaviest fighting. A massive French offensive fails to break the German lines. But for Jeff Gusky, this is more than just another underground site. He hopes American soldiers left a vivid record of their presence here. And before me was an underground city. This place is huge. It just seems to go on and on and on. Oh, my gosh, look. Here's a dog... Man's best friend. What Jeff is entering is a centuries-old quarry, a source of limestone for building, dating back perhaps to the middle ages. All these strokes were made by hand as quarrymen were taking blocks of stone out of these underground mines for castles and cathedrals. Wow, this is the eyepiece of a French gas mask just laying here. A French soldier looked through these eyepieces to protect their face from gas. I wonder if these helped to save a life. That soldier may have been part of the second French attack in late 1917. It finally drives the Germans out of the quarry they've occupied since the early days of the war and where they, too, left behind their mark. The Germans were very organized in the way they marked different sectors. And they just left everything in place, so all around you, you see objects of daily life. You find food cans and tobacco pouches and clocks and pots and pans. And you find shells. Fortunately this is not live. Over several hours, Jeff Gusky finds plenty of images, too, but none obviously American. Beginning to wonder if the story is false, he enters a new gallery. The walls are blank. But then... Oh, wow! This is huge! This is amazing! Looks like it was made yesterday. It's been in darkness for almost a hundred years. Mechanic a. Ardine. Company g 103 U.S. infantry. South Brewer, Maine. I've never heard of that town. Not only German then French, but American soldiers, too, made this their temporary home. E.j. Laskey, Manchester, New Hampshire. This guy is from Boston, Massachusetts. Elvin r. Dickerson, so... Or nickerson. Looks like hundreds and hundreds of Americans were here. And they lived here. I keep seeing New England names. I keep seeing guys from, from Maine and New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. In April 1917, the United States finally enters World War I. Woodrow Wilson has basically campaigned as the president who kept us out of war. And then finally in 1917, the Germans, who are really desperate to break the deadlock on the western front, but they can't do it with their army, return to unrestricted submarine warfare. With her passenger and merchant ships under attack, America declares war on Germany. Americans knew perfectly well how bad the war was, and they nevertheless, in April 1917, joined the war, and I think that the explanation really rests in a lot of ways in their sense that civilization itself was at threat. In this vast underground city, Jeff Gusky has uncovered hundreds of images made by American soldiers in World War I. Who were they? Can he find their descendants? And what do these intriguing symbols mean? Explorer Jeff Gusky arrives in New England on the trail of the names of American soldiers he's found in an underground quarry in France. I'm in Concord, Massachusetts, heading to the Massachusetts national guard archive and armory. It's kind of eerie knowing that some of the young men whose names I photographed in France may have lived on this street and that they were transplanted rather suddenly from this peaceful place... To hell on earth. Good morning. Len Kondratiuk. Welcome, Jeff. Hey, general Kondratiuk, nice to meet you. Lieutenant Jonathan Bratten. Jeff Gusky has come to meet two experts in New England regiments from World War I. This is really the first chance I've had to talk to anyone who knows about what these names mean. And they're guys from Maine, they're guys from Connecticut, from Massachusetts, and... Brigadier general Len Kondratiuk and lieutenant Jonathan Bratten are historians with the Massachusetts and Maine national guard. What part of the front was it? It's right in the chemin de dames. That's where the yankee division first went into the lines in February, march of 1918. Oh, wow. So this is one with what, about eight names on it. Look, the squad commander, corporal blodgett from company e, the 101st infantry, which was from Boston. What's amazing to me is the detail on this. Looks like to me they just listed their names just a few days ago as opposed to a hundred years ago. They're so proud of what they do. Auto rifle squad, and then they even have their chauchat automatic rifle down here. I was simply blown away, I was amazed because I had no idea that anything like this existed. I knew right away that it had to be the yankee division. The yankee division is the nickname that was given to the 26th U.S. division, which was an amalgamation of different national guard regiments that had existed for... Some of them hundreds of years. 28,000 men in all. Jeff Gusky has uncovered a record lost for a hundred years. Few photos survive of the quarries, and only sketchy descriptions. So who were these men of yankee division who left behind their names? They had about 2,000 mainers who have probably never left the state of Maine, because it's a small rural state. You mainly have paper mill workers, lumberjacks, fishermen, potato farmers. What amazes me is the esprit that they had. These were hardy new englanders from the woods of Maine and New Hampshire and the clerks and mechanics of the Boston area. Soon they'd be inscribing words on a French quarry wall to keep alive memories of home. So you'll see underground in big bold letters, "Red Sox 7, yanks 4." 1918 was the last year they won the series, and they're obviously very proud of it. Nearby, another New England soldier carves a self-portrait. At a third site, a German chisels a striking image of field marshal hindenburg. When one side took over a space from another side, they didn't destroy what they saw there. All of the soldiers, whatever side they were on, recognized that the carvings that an individual made had meaning, and they sort of left those things there. The Americans' French allies, who've lived in the quarries for years, produce some of the most profound and elaborate artwork, like a ship named "Liberty," sinking beneath the waves. It really does represent the idea that the first world war really was a great disaster, not only in terms of loss of life, but also just profoundly changing how the world looked at itself and how we interacted with one another. As a bulwark against such an apocalyptic vision, another quarry contains a delicately carved altar whose inscription reads, "god protect France." And just adjacent to it are a series of steps which take you up to the trenches, which then take you out onto the battlefield, and you know those soldiers would pass by that religious altar walking up those steps, knowing what they were about to face. Similar fears surely drove the Americans of yankee division whose names Jeff Gusky has most recently photographed. I'd love to know if there are relatives that are still alive. I'd love to know about who these guys were. You know, you get a sense of their personality from their carvings. Whether through names or symbols, Jeff Gusky is counting on these historians to help him reach a much higher goal: To connect these ghostly names to living descendants. I can go through and start looking up the Maine names. Thank you. That would be fantastic. Company, move out! At the time that the United States enters the war, there are about 120,000 soldiers in the army. It is, I think, the 16th largest army in the world. It's not an enormous force. In fact, many believe the United States will fail to raise an army of significant size. Part of the reason that Americans surprise everyone so quickly is that the level of volunteering is really remarkable. The number of people who volunteer to join forces like the yankee division really sort of brings the numbers of soldiers through the roof. Within a year, two million American troops will deploy overseas to fight on the western front. We have 139,000 cards down here, so sometimes it takes a few minutes, and many of the soldiers have the same names. And oftentimes there'll be the next of kin on the back of the card, which will give us a lead. Arthur blodgett. Ok, I got it. That's him. Len Kondratiuk quickly tracks down corporal blodgett, the squad leader in one of Jeff Gusky's photos. Another squad member, 19-year-old Harold Lombard, soon follows. Jonathan Bratten turns up another 19-year-old... Ralph T. Moan from East Machias, Maine, who wrote a diary about the war. Which is just an absolutely incredible find, especially timed with having just found out that he left his carving in France. An early entry describes running the gauntlet of German u-boats in the Atlantic. "We're now in the danger zone, so the destroyers were continually..." On the lookout for submarines. We'd been out of land for two days now, but on the tenth day sighted england. And at 7 P.M... Moan goes on to describe yankee division's time in the French quarry, including a catastrophic event there. Then Jonathan Bratten makes another discovery. Corporal George Currier, who enlisted in Bangor, Maine, has a son, Jim, who's alive and knows his father's story. When he was young, he was a teamster. He worked in the woods and had a team of four horses and hauled wood, lumber out of the woods. Then when he was 16, he went in the national guard, probably with some friends. They went to fight Pancho Villa down at the Mexican border. Keeping a Mexican revolutionary at bay is child's play compared to what awaits yankee division in France. Three years fighting on the western front has produced a bloody stalemate. Neither side has advanced more than a few miles and at a cost of millions of lives. Now the Germans are poised to make a desperate gamble for victory. Chemin des dames. Quiet now, but a hundred years ago, a deadly sector of the western front. Explorer Jeff Gusky is back, this time with expert support. Military historians Len Kondratiuk and Jonathan Bratten have come to see for themselves the underground city occupied by yankee division. Composed entirely of regiments from New England, they're among the first American divisions to arrive on the western front in early February 1918. They're there at a very critical time that most American units are going to miss, because the Germans are planning their great spring offensive. They've reached a settlement with Soviet Russia, which has just gone through the Russian revolution. The war on the eastern front is over, right? So it means that the Germans can now concentrate all of their forces on the western front. Over half a million of them will soon arrive to confront the Americans, who've barely completed their training in the techniques of trench warfare. In the hidden world of World War I, it's totally raw, it's untouched, it's unfiltered. You get to experience a completely authentic original moment in your life. With only flashlights to guide them, it takes a while to get their bearings. Ok, please be careful. This ground is loaded with dangerous objects. But then, a first trace of yankee division. Oh, my god. That almost looks like a rifle. It is a rifle, the 1903 Springfield rifle for k company. It is. Yep. 2nd Maine perhaps with the 2? Yeah, yeah. Cool, Len. And that's the insignia they wore on their uniform. Right. While they were here, it was on their uniform. And then here's more. Jeff leads them to a familiar name. Oh, my god. This is... Mechanic R.T. Moan. There's Ralph Moan. That's Ralph Moan. When you read about somebody and then you suddenly see this very spot where they were... Because these guys were all buddies, he talks about them in his diary. They formed a singing quartet. Ralph moan was a baritone. But Ralph moan and his buddies were apprehensive entering these strange new quarters. ...about three miles nearer the first line... Let's go back this way. Take a look at this. Wow. There's a skull and crossbones. You see that? Yeah "Death Avenue." It's an ominous sign. Jonathan Bratten recalls a passage in moan's account. When they first got here, they were told not to touch anything because the Germans had booby-trapped large portions of the cave. But it just seemed like one of those soldier myths that gets passed around the army, and I didn't really put a lot of stock in it. This is a major roof collapse that I think could be related to moan's story. 1,200 frenchmen were quartered in one part of this cave, but they were simply wiped out, for the Germans had the whole cave mined. That whole section blew to pieces so not a frenchman escaped. We are very likely standing atop a cemetery that no one knows about. Um, there are men under here, their bodies... Ralph moan sums up the grim realities of war he and his fellow soldiers are facing. I think we're getting into an area that is your unit, uh, the 101st. Take a look at this, Len. Oh, man, that's pretty cool. Oh, my gosh. That's a work of art. Do you know any of these names? I do. I do. I recognize their names because I actually have their military records. And corporal blodgett is from Medford, Massachusetts. He is the section leader. His squad, it's made up of irishmen and Yankees. It's America at its best. There are two lombards. Are they brothers? They are. Francis Lombard and Harold Lombard. Records show the brothers enlisted the same day and survived the war, but Len is still trying to find out what became of them. And what's interesting to me is that here's a picture of a chauchat machine gun, and that's what they carried throughout the war. The United States didn't have any small machine guns. The French equipped the Americans with this chauchat machine gun. Guys, there's chauchat magazines to hold the rounds for that very gun. Possibly carried by the same squad. Yeah. The squad carries another piece of equipment to protect them against one of the real horrors of World War I... Poison gas. No one likes a gas mask. It really curtails your vision, um, you're like... If you suffer from claustrophobia, it's got to be absolutely horrible, but they're essential. Especially when out in the open. Using a period map, Len Kondratiuk and Jonathan Bratten study yankee division's battle plan. With pinon being the front lines, the cave being back here... What would you say that is? About, uh... About 5 kilometers according to the map. Yep. German artillery could still reach the cave. Oh, easily. The underground quarry lies a few miles behind the front line. Each company moves forward for a week across a landscape bearing no resemblance to today. It has been blown to smithereens. It's like a moonscape. Trees are destroyed, these muddy trenches, a lot of the vegetation has been blasted away. And their problem is that there literally is no place to hide. On the surface, everything was destroyed, it was dehumanized, it was no longer hospitable to life. And underground, you find a world where you could be human. After a week spent on the front line, the quarry provides a welcome relief... An underground city complete with electricity, telephones, and other facilities. Some of the remnants are still here. What is this? You know what that is? What is it? That's a rail car used by the narrow Gauge line down below. That's how they would move the supplies around. Oh, that is... yeah, that's a wheel. Yeah, sure enough. Donkeys would pull this. These were run by French soldiers, and the Americans would feed the donkeys. And the donkey would stop once you fed them. So it took the French soldiers days to figure out the Americans were just playing with them. The first world war is an interesting combination of the most modern weapons, but combined with ancient forms of transportation, like the horse or the mule for pulling artillery, carts, ambulances. Just to the left is a guy riding a horse. He's wearing a campaign hat. Exactly. Yankee division soldiers pay tribute to these animals in their carvings. This one is also going to touch your heart. Corporal George Louis Currier, company G 103 U.S. infantry. February 14, 1918. It's a cross. Don't we know his ancestors? His son still lives? Yeah, and he talks about his father. Uh, he had a horse that he was taking care of. And men developed a very, very, very personal connection with their animals. My dad saw that the gas was, they were having a gas attack, and his thing was to get to the horse and to get that gas mask on the horse before anything, and he'd take care of himself afterwards, and I'm sure that's where he got gassed, it was doing that. Over the years, uh, physically and medically, he suffered for taking care of the horse, and it shortened his lifespan in the end. Jeff Gusky leads his team to a section of the quarry that has always intrigued yet baffled him. There's a mystery in this place. I've never been able to figure it out. Why here do you have Indian carvings? And I think I can find some of them above. Let's see. Wait, here. Look at this. - Oh. - It's a canoe. Yeah, that's your typical birch bark canoe. Do you have any idea why you'd have Indians here? What this could be a symbol of is there were the nine Passamaquoddy in company I, and they all came from pleasant point, Maine, which is where the nation exists now. There are, yeah. There were Indians, yeah, in company I. Initially skeptical about the story himself, Jonathan Bratten digs deep into the Maine military records. When I got down to examining the actual roster, lo and behold, it's true, there were nine of these guys, including the chief's son, Moses Neptune. And these guys served in company I throughout the war. More astonishing still is that these native Americans would volunteer to fight in the first place. When we entered World War I in 1917, Passamaquoddys didn't have the right to vote, they didn't have the right to own land individually. A lot of rights that people take for granted. Citizenship to the American Indians in the United States didn't come about until 1924. For Jeff, this poses a new challenge. Are these carvings the work of native Americans? Holy cow! That's a full relief of a headdress and everything. That's incredible. But none of the carvings has a name. And without a name, Jeff Gusky's team has no definitive proof connecting the Passamaquoddy to these intriguing symbols. In his final days at Chemin des Dames, Ralph moan engages in a bloody night fight with a German patrol. Second platoon got wise. We jumped up and put hand grenades and machine guns to them. One man had his head blown off and it made a ghastly sight, suspended in the barbed wire. The snipers got about... He ends his diary in march, and it says I'm going to cut this diary out right now, no one wants to remember what we've been through. From now on all we see is hell. And "hell" is capitalized. It hits you right here. March 18, 1918, yankee division leaves the front. But when the German spring offensive smashes through allied lines, yankee division will be called upon to fight a crucial battle. German forces are within striking distance of Paris. Wow. Explorer Jeff Gusky and his team discover an American eagle carved by an unknown soldier from yankee division. But in 1918, the quarry they recently occupied falls back into enemy hands. In late June, the Germans storm south as far as the marne river. In the center of the hastily assembled allied defense line barring their way to Paris, German forces once again find yankee division. They meet in a picturesque-sounding place... Belleau wood. The woods were so battle-scarred that you could barely dig in because there were so many dead bodies. Military historians Len Kondratiuk and Jonathan Bratten make their way to yankee division's front line, while Jeff Gusky meets up with historian Rob dalessandro. The truth of the matter is that yankee division spent thousands of lives, casualties killed in action or wounded, to take this piece of ground. Right here? Right here, right where we're standing. And this hill was almost impossible to take because of the effects of artillery. So this is the devil. A German field artillery piece. And it all comes down to this little part right here. This is called the recoil mechanism. And it allows artillery to be used over and over again very quickly in a pinpoint fashion. They were under fire the whole time. I mean, this could either be a fighting position or a big shell hole. Rob, I've seen hundreds and hundreds of American names in darkness on the walls of underground cities. Is this what drove them there? Exactly. If you're out in the open and these guns are raining down on you, you're finished. That barrel was a killer of thousands and thousands of soldiers. And artillery really reaches its primacy during the first world war. After two weeks of hard fighting, yankee division and the allied forces prevail at belleau wood and begin pushing the Germans back. They must have been exhausted because they advanced, I think about nine miles during the offensive. 15 kilometers in heavy machine-gun fire, artillery, gas, not eating. And if you're advancing in gas, you've got your gas mask on. The war wasn't over at that point by any means, but it was absolutely a crucial turning point. The Germans never are able to make another large-scale impact on the front lines. The Americans begin to chip away and eventually break through pretty spectacularly in the fall of 1918. Among the 3,000 yankee division soldiers killed and wounded in July 1918 are several whose names Jeff Gusky and his team have come to know from the Chemin des Dames quarry. Oh, yes! This is a guy from Maine. Leroy Hoskins. Oh, my gosh! What's so important about Hoskins? So you know how we talk about family connections? Yeah. There were three Hoskins... Yeah. In company f 103rd, all from Milo. Two of them were brothers. Leroy was their nephew. And Leroy was wounded in action severely. It's strange, but in a small town he had two uncles named Hoskins also that were enlisted at approximately the same time, one of which was killed in the war, and of course one of them, my grandfather, was wounded, so two out of three in one family is quite a number when you look at the town of Milo, which only had 2,000 people at the time. Harold Lombard with the automatic rifle squad is one of the lucky ones. He made it through the war unscathed, returned home, and started a family. On a quiet street in Springfield, Vermont, Jeff Gusky manages to track down two of his three sons, David and Harold Lombard, Jr. Hello. Well, Jeff Gusky! At last we meet. Mr. Lombard, it's a pleasure. - Hooray! - It's a pleasure. - Jeff, Dave Lombard. - Good to meet you. It's a pleasure. Harold, Dave, I have something to show you that you probably never knew existed. A photograph of an inscription that your dad wrote in 1918. And this came from where? This is an underground city. It was a quarry prior to World War I, going back to the middle ages. How does it make you feel? It's, I, it... It makes me feel I'm with my father right there, underground. That means a lot. No, it really means a lot. And it's wonderful of you to bring these pictures. It's an honor. Yeah, that's the brothers, right next to each other, on the wall there. Besides his brother Francis, Harold had with him another constant companion. A new testament, a pocket version, that he carried in his pocket all through the war. And on the leading fly leafs, he's listed right there are all the battles that they fought in, I believe. Today has been a day I will never forget. I held a Bible that was in the pocket of this gentleman's father when he wrote his inscription almost a hundred years ago. I was there last Thursday, underground in France, in front of that inscription, just where he would have been. The only inscription with an exclamation point after it is the one that says "home." And I can imagine what a wonderful scene that must have been and how grateful his parents were and how glad they were to see Harold and his brother Francis finally come home from this awful, awful war. Jeff, welcome to Maine. Jonathan, great to see you again. Good to see you again. Come on in. At the military historical society museum in Augusta, Maine, with the help of lieutenant Jonathan Bratten, past and present are about to converge again. I've got something for you. Great. This was left by your grandfather almost a hundred years ago underground, beneath a farm field in France, where he was for about six weeks during World War I. Corporal Leroy Hoskins, company F. Can you picture him with his bayonet, carving into the stone? He was a pretty detailed guy, so yes, I can. He'd want to make sure everything was just right so people would know he was there. There's no question about that. This is, uh, a photo of my grandfather right after the war. He was smart enough to marry this lady right here, who's my grandmother. I found out personal stories that are so human. For example, one young man signed his name in a very particular way. February 14, 1918. George Louis Currier. Yeah, that's his writing. You recognize it? Yes, it is, 'cause I can tell by the way he, the gs in his name. As a matter of fact, it's really funny because when I print, I print just like that. It's like a shipwrecked person who wants someone to know that they once lived, and so they put a note in a bottle, and decades after that shipwrecked person is gone from this earth, it washes up on shore and someone finds it. But one set of inscriptions is still unaccounted for. Those mysterious American Indian carvings... Are they from the Passamaquoddy or someone else? North of Verdun in France, Jeff Gusky follows a trench line where yankee division fought its final bloody campaign of World War I. In the Meuse-Argonne region, 1.2 million American troops, the largest number of the war, attack as the allies push the Germans to surrender. The Meuse-Argonne offensive, October, November 1918, is the deadliest or costliest military campaign in American history. The casualties are just enormous. We lost, to both combat and disease, over 125,000 men. Jeff's drawn here by one unit, the Passamaquoddy Indian squad. He's looking for evidence that might connect them to elusive symbols carved on the cavern walls. In the final days of the war, the squad is attacking German strong points like this. I feel like I'm walking on almost sacred ground. The last full day of the war, November 10, 1918, the American yankee division were in the midst of a violent battle right here, pushing the Germans back. Among them is the Passamaquoddy chief's son, Moses Neptune. I found this letter written by Moses Neptune talking about the war and how everybody's going to church and how he's sending most of his money to his parents. School children and all who help... I have sent $20 to you and hope you will get it. I'm going to send $5 to my brother Joe. All the boys have gone to hospital with the flu. Only George Stevens and I stayed with the company... The family received that letter two weeks after they were notified by the military that their son died. He was destined to be the traditional chief, and perhaps he joined the military to go, uh... Get some worldly experience. I'm not sure. On the last full day of that war he lost his life, and we lost him, as a family and as a nation, you know... Passamaquoddy nation. Moses Neptune is among the last of the roughly 10 million soldiers killed before World War I finally ends on November 11, 1918. The gunfire stopped. The killing was over. The terrible traumatic injuries would happen no more. But the scars of a hundred years ago are still with us. Jeff Gusky knows the Passamaquoddy fought valiantly among these ruins. Look at this. But did Moses Neptune and his brothers carve these symbols? It's a mystery that's been waiting to be solved for a hundred years. I was able to go into the caves in France. And when you get down there, there's just carvings all over the walls. Military historian Jonathan Bratten has come to find out if Jeff's photos contain details only a Passamaquoddy tribal member can identify. And is this type of headdress... At the time period, this would be the type of headdress. Our traditional headdress is shaped a little bit different. But in the late 1800s, a lot of the men joined the wild west show, and they came back with these sioux head bonnets. Wow. And you can see the profile. To me it looks like one of the soldiers. And then he's got the headdress sort of radiating out of him. If I saw this earlier, I could have showed you some paintings of the exact same thing. We have lines radiating out of them to show the spiritual connection. But it's this image of a simple object which turns out to conceal hidden meaning. Can you see the outline? Do you think it's a canoe? Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. It took a while. I was focusing on those symbols. The crucial clue is invisible to anyone who's not Passamaquoddy. I don't know if you see that, but you can see it's almost like a German swastika. For us it's been a cultural symbol for thousands and thousands of years, and it means peace and friendship. The images of the culture are more important than an individual's initials or names. Yeah. Yeah, these are powerful, powerful symbols that they were there. Finally, the connection Jeff Gusky and his team have been searching for. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the grand entry. Thanks in part to Jeff Gusky's images, the courage shown by the Passamaquoddy soldiers who carved them is finally being recognized. In July 2016, at the community hall, some 300 tribal members gather for a special ceremony. Many are veterans, proudly wearing their uniforms. Passamaquoddy people have been involved in wars since time immemorial, protecting our homeland. Today we'll be honoring Samuel Dana, George Stevens, Sr., Moses Neptune, Henry Sockbeson, David Sopiel, and Charles Lola. During World War I, when the soldiers were wounded or killed, they didn't receive the recognition that other soldiers received because they weren't citizens. Almost 100 years later, that wrong is finally being put right. Medals will be presented by lieutenant Bratten and Linda Allen. The families of the six Passamaquoddy soldiers wounded or killed in action while fighting with yankee division are receiving the honors denied to them during their lifetime. On behalf of the Maine army national guard and the bureau of veterans services, we present the gold star honorable service medal to the family of Moses W. Neptune. Moses was the son of the tribal chief, William Neptune. So let it not be said that the Passamaquoddy did not send their best to war in defense of their nation and their country. To come face to face with their family members after seeing what they've done in France... You can't put into words the type of, um, feelings that you have. Thank you. Thank you. Your father, David T. Sopiel, who was wounded outside the woods of Epieds, France, on July 22, 1918... His actions were critical in winning the battle of Chateau-Thierry. I think when they carved their names and their symbols of their culture and heritage on the walls at the chemins des dames was asking to remember us. And I think, uh, that's what we're doing now and it's what we must continue to do in the future. For the tribe, it's completing the circle, the circle that we know things will be right eventually, even for the warriors of World War I. Far from the celebrations, Jeff Gusky can still feel proud. His photographs have helped bring an ancient injustice to light. It spurs him to continue. These young men who wrote their names on the walls of the underground cities almost a hundred years ago have family members that are still alive. And I realize now that the work is just beginning. It's important to realize that great historical events are not fought by masses; they're fought by individuals. And the stories of every individual is what makes up that story. This is so beautiful. It looks like a guy from New Hampshire. There are hundreds of stories left to be told.
