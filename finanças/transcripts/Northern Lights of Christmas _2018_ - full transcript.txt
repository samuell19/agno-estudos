Are you a pilot? Oh, yes I am. That's what I wanna be. So far I'm good with my take offs, but my landings need work. They do? Oh it's just an app but it feels real. Well, one day it will be. Until then... Here is your first set of wings. Wow, thanks. You're welcome. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hi, Zoey. Oh, hey, Phil, how's the charter business going? It's great, I just bought a bigger plane. Ugh, you're my role model. Well, I'm auctioning off my old piper next month. You should bid. Maybe I will. I hope you do. Have a Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Phil. Hey, honey. Hi, mom. Your dad's here too, I'm putting you on speaker. Hi. honey! Well, um, I just got the letter. The probates cleared. I've officially inherited Gus Henderson's ranch. How are you feeling about it? Honestly I'm pretty sad. I mean I can't imagine the place without him. And I can't believe he left it to me. Oh of course he left it to you, honey, he was like your grandfather. And he taught you how to fly. I think Gus giving you his ranch is his way of helping you get your own plane. I'd rather have Gus. But I'm on a plane tomorrow to Alaska, I'm gonna sign the papers and um... Take a look at it one last time before I put it on the market. You are gonna be back in Tampa in time for Christmas? That's two weeks away. I'll be out of Alaska in one week... tops. Can't wait to see you. Love you. Love you. Love you too. Thanks. Aurora. It's just like how I remember it. Christmas time's the best. Yeah. Who rides a motorcycle in December in Alaska? Otto, just try a peppermint brownie. The customers will love them and they're Christmassy. Anya, we serve apple pie, lemon pie, and chocolate pudding. Nobody orders the chocolate pudding. Yes, they do. Nobody orders it twice. Just try one of the brownies. They're delicious. Ate half a pan last night. I'll think about it. Merry Christmas. Zoey! You're here early! Hi. Hi, Brock. Hey. And hello, Otto. Do I know you? Otto, you remember Zoey. My best friend from high school. We used to hang out here all the time. When I was a teenager I used Gus's plane to buy you a replacement coil for your deep fryer. The teenaged pilot. You saved my summer! I remember you, you were Gus Henderson's best student. How are your parents? They're great, yeah my dad's still working at the post office in Florida, they love the weather. I'm so excited that you're here. You won't reconsider staying with me and Brock? Oh, you know what? I'm gonna stay at the ranch. It think it might be my last chance. Okay, well then let us bring over dinner tonight. We'll get caught up. Dinner sounds great! I'll send over some chocolate pudding. Ooh, that's okay. Zoey Hathaway, is that you? Mrs. Walker! You're not in ninth grade anymore, call me Tracy. I hear Gus left you his Ranch. He did. Are you gonna do the Christmas Festival this year? It hasn't been the same since Gus stopped. Oh I'm only in town for a little while, I don't think so. Oh, well maybe next year. It's so good to see you! You're all grown up. Bye. Bye! That takes care of the transfer fee. Now the property is officially yours. You know I have seen people put their cats on these, but never a plane. Yeah, it's there to motivate me. I'd like to start my own charter airline. Wow, and you've always wanted to fly? Pretty much. I remember when I was little I would go with my dad to pick up the bags when Gus would do a mail run. I'd watch that plane land and just think, "Wow, I wanna do that." Now you are, it's all that you hoped for? Honestly, it's better. It's like getting paid to have fun. Sometimes I think I'm more at home in the air than on the ground. How long did you say you were\ in town for? Just a couple of days, and then Christmas in Florida, and back home to Seattle. Hey, you don't have a recommendation for a real estate agent in the area, do you? Absolutely. It's a small town, we all wear a lot of hats. Well, you are hired. Well I'll go through my buyers list, but if no one bites we might not be able to sell the ranch until Spring. Oh, is that gonna be a problem? These Alaskan winters can be rough. No, it shouldn't be. Yes, a ranch like yours does need constant care, plumbing, wiring, roofing, but you're very lucky that your caretaker, Alec is really good. Alec, yes, Gus mentioned him to me over the phone. He used to be a wilderness guy? He still is. He's been helping Gus out in the winters ever since Ida passed. Gus already paid for the entire season, so... Thank you, Gus. All right, well let's go take a look at your ranch. All right, let's go. Well, it's a little isolated out here but Alec is usually around. There's his pickup. I love this place so much. You moved away just before I cam to Aurora. Did you spend a lot of time here at the ranch? Well Gus and Ida were like grandparents to me, and I actually lived here my senior year when my dad was transferred to Florida. So this is like a homecoming for you. Are you sure you wanna sell? Well, in a perfect world I'd keep it, but my life is in Seattle. Don't make me doubt myself, you'll lose your commission. Forget I said anything. You know if it wasn't the middle of December, this place would be very marketable. Oh and there's a jeep in the garage. Hey, Gus and Ida's trees. Oh, they've grown! It's such a sweet gesture, planting a live Christmas tree for every year they were married. It's like a love letter written in trees. I love this room! It's amazing. Is this you? Yeah, that's the day I got my pilot's license. Gus was such a good teacher. He and Ida were so kind to me. Everyone in town loved them. Oh, this brand new kitchen will completely sell this house. Gus retired, and he sold his Cessna to Geoff Peters, and then he put all that money into building Ida's dream kitchen. Oh, there she is! Who? Hi, Holly. Oh I remember when Gus and Ida found her. She just lost her mother and they bottle fed her. She must be 15 years old. Now you, Mister... Never met you before. Oh that's Palmer, Gus got him last year. Alec has been taking such great care of both reindeer. Oh... quite an entrance. Are you gonna introduce me, or should I introduce myself? Zoey Hathaway meet Alec Wynn. Oh, nice to meet you, I've heard such good things about you. I've heard about you too. Well I don't mean to be blunt, but, uh... you staying or selling? Actually, I'm selling. Well it was nice to meet you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a fence to repair. Palmer keeps getting out. Bye. Alec is a good guy. A little rough around the edges, maybe. Yeah, I can see that. Hey, come here! Come here! Hi.. Hi, Palmer, I'm Zoey, nice to meet you. Wow, it smells amazing. You need to stop working for Otto and open your own restaurant. That's the master plan. Not for another few years or so. Maybe open a restaurant or B&B. What are you looking for? This. Ida had a secret recipe for Christmas Wreath cookies. Oh I loved those, they were so crunchy. Everybody did, she made hundreds of them for the Christmas Festival, and I am dying to know how she made them. It's not here. On the plus side, if you need 20 ways to cook salmon you're set. Thank you, good to know. I'm so glad you're here. Video chatting isn't the same. No, it's not. I love Aurora, but you see such fabulous places. I bet you get to hang out with the cool people every night. Guys, I'm up at four in the morning, and I'm in bed at eight at night, the cool people are being cool without me. By the way I met Alec Wynn today. He was not very talkative. He talked? At the diner, the most I get is a please and a thank you. He's a nice guy, I know Gus liked him. Yeah, so Gus mentioned him to me on the phone. He said he trusted him, but I was actually picturing somebody more Gus's age. So Alec is gonna stay onto the place still? Well, I haven't talked to him about it yet, but he's paid through the winter, so... I just hope the place sells really fast, and then we'll be totally covered. Well I think dinner's ready. Who's hungry? Me! Uh, I am. Let's go. Coming! Good morning. I'm feeding the reindeer, I wanna show you how to do it. Oh, no, can't we do that later? No. Dress in something warm. I know how to dress. I'm here. Oh, look at all these decorations from the Christmas Festival. It's the sleigh. This is the sleigh! All the kids from the town get their picture taken with Santa on this sleigh. Oh, look at all these lights. Holly and Palmer are waiting. Oh, so sorry, didn't mean to delay your breakfast. So the reindeer get fed twice a day, and I aim for 6am, 6pm. Got it. Good. They each get one scoop of these pellets, and some hay. You'll need more feed in a couple of days, you can get it at the hardware store in town. Check. Now the well freezes up in the pump house. If the light goes out you gotta keep an eye on that. Oil furnace needs a delivery next month. And there's a generator back there if the power goes out. Okay. Good luck. Good luck? Where are you going? He's charming, isn't he? Whoa. Are you leaving? It's your place now. Now that you're here it's time for me to move on. But I'm not staying. I need you here. And Karen said Gus paid you through the winter. And I gave you the money back. All right, I don't understand. What's really going on here? Gus loved this ranch, he built the house himself, him and Ida planted all those trees. He didn't leave it to you just so you could sell it to some strangers. He left it to me so I could buy my plane. Oh yeah? He tell you that? Well not in so many words, but he knew I lived in Seattle, he knew I was saving up to buy a plane. He had to know I'd sell the ranch. Sounds like to me you're just planning on dumping it. I'm not gonna sell it to just anyone. I'm gonna sell it to someone who loves it just as much as we do, and who's gonna care for it. And the reindeer. Oh, well what if the new owners don't want a reindeer? You haven't thought this through have you? Holly and Palmer deserve a good home. I'm gonna find them a good home, but I can't stay here, Alec. My job is in Seattle. I need you here. What if you were involved in the sale? How? We'll have a partnership. It can't be a partnership. Of course we can. We'll work together to find the perfect buyer for this place. You'll be an important part of the decision. Oh. But you hold all the cards. All right, so I'll give you an ace. If you stay until this place sells I'll give you 10 percent. It's not about the money. And I promise to listen to whatever you have to say about the buyer. If you think I'm selling to the wrong person, tell me, I'll listen, I'm a very good listener. You sure are a good talker. If you ever get tired of flying you can go into sales. Well, you're a tough customer. What do I have to do to seal this deal? Throw in a toaster? I don't need a toaster. You don't know me, why does my opinion matter? Gus trusted you. That means a lot to me. This ranch is special. It needs you. So do I. Deal? Deal. So I've only got four more days in town and I really wanna spruce up the place. All those real estate shows say that the little details make a big difference. Like what? Like maybe put some Christmas lights up around the windows. Only have to take them down in January. But they'd be so pretty. You want stockings and candy canes too? Maybe a train set running through the yard? Not much of a Christmas fan, huh? Not really. I love Christmas. Why am I not surprised? So what else are we gonna do? Well clean everything, de-clutter, oh and I think the thermostat might be broken on the furnace. I installed the furnace, I can take a look at that. Great, thank you, and if we need a new one I'll just grab one at the hardware store. I have a project list too. Banister on the porch is loose, got to trim back those trees, and we need to take a look at that barn. We make a good team. Yeah. Okay. These boards are all worn out, we'll have to clear the whole barn. Oh... Well we can't have everything. I guess the floor can wait. I promise that we will find you a good home. That's a cool picture. Who took that? I did. Wow. I saw some camera equipment. So that-- are you a professional? No, just a hobby. That's cool. Okay, I'm gonna go to the hardware store and get a little bit more reindeer feed. Karen said something about me inheriting a Jeep? Can you drive stick? Can I drive stick? If it's got wheels, wings or a rudder I can make it go. Oh, Merry Christmas, how can I help you? Hi, I need a new one of these, do you have one? Yeah, one thermostat coming up, um anything else? Um... yeah. Is that everything? It's a start. Cool. Are you the pilot? The one that used to live here? Yes. I always wanted to learn how to fly, and then Gus sold his plane before I could take any lessons, so... Could you teach me? Oh I'm only here for a couple of days, I don't have time. That's too bad. Oh Zoey, you're exactly who I need to talk to, but just one second. Hey Danny, George is tying a Christmas tree up to my car, could you ring it up for me, please? Yeah, sure thing Mrs. Yazzi. Thanks. Fixing things up out there? Yeah, starting to. All right, well no pressure, but I just spoke with a potential buyer, I cannot believe how lucky we are, but they're actually very interested. Can I bring them out tomorrow morning? Absolutely. All right, try and make the ranch look as homey as possible. This might be our last chance until spring. Like I said, no pressure. You got it. Thank you, Danny, Merry Christmas. I'll see you tomorrow, fingers crossed. Fingers crossed! Know what? I'm gonna go check out your Christmas trees out there. I'll be back. Sure. Here comes Santa Claus! You bought a tree? We have a buyer coming tomorrow. Karen thinks we should make the place a little more homey. You own a mountain covered in trees and you bought one from the store? Oh, good point. Little late. I like this tree. Oh! Let me help. Thank you. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la ♪ Everybody! ♪ Tis the season to be jolly ♪ Not a singer? No. Why am I not surprised? Want me to install this thermostat? Yes, please. Nice talking to ya. ♪ And heaven and nature sing, and heaven and nature sing ♪ You know you're gonna scare the reindeer. ♪ And He-ea-van ♪ ♪ And Heaven and nature siiiing ♪ Okay. Here we are. It's so pretty. Welcome to the ranch. It's gorgeous. We've been looking all over, and so far this place checks all the boxes. This river rock is so dated. You think we could paint it white? Well we did that back at the Montana ranch, looked great. You own a ranch in Montana? We used to, but we just didn't use it enough, but we've always wanted to own a home in Alaska. I'm not sure if this barn is big enough. Oh Alec, these are the Upsons. What kind of livestock you planning on? Oh not livestock. I have a lot of... Well, Melissa likes to call them toys. In Alaska, I'll need snow mobiles, a couple boats, some off road vehicles. Back home in Connecticut he had to build a second garage. What can I say? I like my toys. It's plenty big enough. We just need to clear it out a little bit. Oh yes, clearing out of the barn is definitely on the to do list before the sale. That's me. Come on. Come on, fella. Bye. They leaving already? Hey, Alec, great news. They think this would make the perfect vacation house. She kept nudging him to stop talking, and he said they're gonna make an offer. The plane goes up for auction next month, and I never thought I'd be able to say this, but... I think I'm gonna be able to make a bid. What's wrong with you? So when you said you wanted great people to buy the ranch, you just meant anyone who would make an offer? What? There's nothing wrong with the Upsons. You really think that? Pfft! Sure. First they'll start with the barn, and then they'll tear the whole house down. Are we partners in this or not? We are. Then I vote no. Hey. Hey. You're already up. Yes I am. Well, I feel like you're about to break up our partnership. No... No, I-I wanna be partners. I think I was so focused on the sale, I wasn't thinking things through. The Upsons aren't bad people, they're-- No, of course they're not, but they're not our buyers. But I've also flown charters with people like that before and they're... Careless? Exactly. They're gonna get bored with this place in a year. Maybe two, and then they're gonna sell it without giving it a second thought. Gus wouldn't want the place to be empty most of the year. And he definitely wouldn't want that fireplace to be painted white. It's just... those were Karen's best prospects. Sorry. So... I wonder... We want to show the world how spectacular this ranch is, right? Mm-hm. I was talking to Tracy Walker, and she asked me about Gus's Christmas Festival. Did you ever see it? No. Gus did talk about it, though. It's my favourite Aurora memory. What if we revived it? What? Now? We're looking for the perfect buyer, right? It's a great way to spread the word and show the place off. People used to come from all over. Plus I think it would be really fun. The town would love it. And when would this be happening? Um, okay, Christmas is in nine days, so... It would be next Saturday, the 23rd. Next Saturday? Ooh, I'd have to change my flight to Florida, but I could do that. You think it's a bad idea? No, it's just a lot to do in a very short period of time. Well, we can do that. Come on! Ooh, okay, these go-- okay, they go right outside the barn next to the sleigh. We're gonna need a Santa. No... no. All right, you know what? You have neither the physique nor the personality. Oh my Christmas village! And we're gonna have our work cut out for us organizing these lights. Oh, I need a great picture of Gus. Right here! Whoa, what are you doing with that? You'll see. y Christmas. Merry Christmas! You don't look very merry. This isn't my kind of thing. How long do we have to be doing this for? Until all the flyers are gone. Oh, Samantha! Zoey! I heard you were back. Listen, stop by the dress shop. I wanna hear everything about everything. I will. And this is fantastic! The festival was always my favourite part of Christmas. Yeah, me too. I used to do half my shopping at the craft booths. Oh, those booths were great. I don't think we'll have time to organize that this year. I know all the crafts people in town. Let me handle the booths? That would be great! I'm happy to help! So good to see you. Thanks. That's huge. Merry Christmas. Tracy! Oh hey! So you're gonna be in town long enough after all. You kind of inspired me. I'm so glad. I mean, the festival was always the heart of this town. Things just weren't the same after it stopped. You're doing a wonderful thing. And so are you. Oh! Bye! My ninth grade teacher. She's a hugger. I noticed. This makes me so happy. Can Brock and me be in charge of food? Ooh, I'd have to check with my planning partner here. Yes... yes. Geoff Peters! Oh! Zoey! Hi! It's great to see you. You too! Oh man. How's Gus's plane? She's a beauty. I'm covering Gus's old delivery route everyday. She's steady as can be. That's great. Geoff, aren't you supposed to be on your mail run right now? Yeah, about that. That reindeer of Gus's shut the air strip again. And it's your reindeer now, right? Yeah, wait... You said Palmer had been getting out, but the air strip's miles away. We gotta go get him. Mm-hm. Sorry, Geoff. Yeah. Palmer, what are you doing here? Come on, bud, we gotta head home. You know what? I'm kinda a city girl. Reindeer wrangling isn't really my department. What's the protocol here? Do you-- do you get nervous if I... Come a little bit towards you? No, okay. I'm gonna go back and see if Alec has gotten here yet-- You okay? I wasn't talking to a reindeer. Palmer? Palmer, come here buddy. Come here, it's okay. Hey, it's okay, buddy. Well, you made that look easy. Yeah, lots of practice. So he's been to this airstrip before? Yeah, last month. Why does he keep coming back here? I have no idea. Good, you got him. Zoey Hathaway! Chuck. Merry Christmas, and uh... welcome back to Aurora. Thanks, how's the airstrip these days? The airstrips better than ever. It's just my knees. They're getting a little creaky, but after 40 years on the job, well, I don't blame 'em. Come on inside, I need to talk to you. Sure, yeah, you got it. We'll be right back. You're the legal owner of the reindeer now, right? Right. And this is the second time he's delayed a flight. Yeah, I'm sorry about that, I'll make sure it never happens again. Well, I'm sorry too, because with a second offence there's a fine. The FAA does not mess around. Will that be cash or credit? Oh, um... debit. Getting a lot of use these days. I'm never gonna get my plane. Sorry? Nothing. Mom, don't worry, I will be home for Christmas. I'm flying on standby with a buddy pass on Christmas Eve day. You know what? I have to go, I'm making toffee for the Christmas Festival. All right, I love you. Okay, start on the nuts. Flying on Christmas Eve is gonna be tricky. Yeah, that's what she said. She's worried I'm not gonna make it. She should be. No, it'll be fine. I always spend it with them. Oh, it's my Dad. Hello. Would you stop? Listen, even if I have to hitch a ride on Santa's sleigh, I will be home in Florida for Christmas. Bye. Bye. Okay, I think we did it. All right, ready to test 'em? Yes. Okay. Hey! That looks great! Ooh. Wait, what just happened? We just blew the generator. No! Yeah... I need a new generator. No problem. And 500 strings of Christmas lights. That could be a problem. I don't have that many lights at the store. Um, I mean we got what you need in Fairbanks, but it wouldn't be here until after Christmas. Well, can they be overnighted? We could send a truck but... it's gonna cost ya... a lot. Well, I've gotta have them. Here you go. My plane fund, it's getting emptier and emptier. Do you have to put on the festival? I know people are looking forward to it. I'm putting it on so that people can see the property. If they come from out of town, they'll see Aurora at it's best. I love this place. I Forgot how much I missed everyone here. Oh, thanks, Otto. So what time does the barn dance start after the festival? I forgot about the barn dance! Oh you gotta have a dance. You know Gus and Ida used to always have Santa in the sleighs, lights in the trees, and that big Christmas star on top of the ranch house. I haven't even seen that star. Oh you've gotta find it. But most of all, you've gotta finish off with a big barn dance. I mean we have to celebrate. Otto is a big grump all year, but at Christmas he's like a little kid. I am not a grump. You know that barn floor is not in good shape. There's reindeer living in there. The reindeer are the guests of honour. Oh. Otto's got an answer for everything. I wish I did. I'm back. Do not tell me you need more lights. You are gonna outshine the Aurora Borealis. No, do you have any wide plank oak flooring? I need to fix the barn floor fast. For the barn dance? Everybody's looking forward to it. Yeah, I have plenty of wide plank oak. It's a little spendy. Of course it is. So I was wondering... The hardware store used to do this Christmas ring toss booth, um... and it's for little kids, but... You know, it's really fun. I remember that. Any chance you'd wanna organize that for the festival? Really? You're sure? Yes, I'm sure. Yeah, yeah, I could do that. Cool. Great. Where are the Christmas lights? Oh, they're coming on the truck tomorrow. And these are boards for the barn. There's gonna be a dance. I know it's getting bigger and bigger, but I really appreciate all your work. I don't mind, I kinda feel like I'm doing it for Gus. He was sad that he had to stop the festival. He always said someday he would start it up again. I guess someday is now. You know there used to be this big star that all the kids would make wishes on. Do you know what happened to that? Yeah, he lent it to a church in Greenville a couple of years ago. You think we could get it back? It's 150 miles away. Oh, so we could drive that. And the pass is already snowed in. So we can't drive that. No. Well, I guess we can't have everything. All right, I've got this guy, you got those. After you. Thank you. And house supplies, flooring. There's the lights. FAA fine equals... Oof. So the Hathaway charter fund is not looking good. And we're finished. All right, thanks for the help. Yeah, no problem. And you got a couple boards left over. That's all right, I'll just throw 'em in the cabin. You know I'm surprised how much I'm liking that cabin. I've always said, living outside in a tent is the way to go. Having a roof over my head and a nice comfy bed... Pretty nice. You think that means I'm getting old? Yeah, it does. You didn't have to be that honest. Oh, hey, look at you. One dance floor ready to go. Well good, 'cause they just delivered 500 strings of Christmas lights and a generator. Do you wanna help? We've got 27 trees that need lighting. Oh no ,I gotta get back to the diner. Yeah, you kids have fun. All right. Lazy! I know, right? There's years of happiness in Gus and Ida's trees. This is the longest I've been earth bound since I got my license. I gotta get up in the air. I like my feet on the ground. Never been in a plane in my life. What?! How'd you get to Alaska? They got these things called "roads." I gotta get you up in the sky. Yeah... No thanks. All right, it'd be you and me in the cockpit, we'd have the whole sky in front of us. It's the best feeling in the world. Oh, thank you. Here you go. So how long you been in Alaska? Seven years now. Never stayed in one place much until I started spending winters here with Gus. Where were you before that? All over, but I'd spend the rest of the year at a glacier tour company. Ooh, that sounds interesting. Cold. Yes, it was. Gus used to say uh, if I spent one more year there, I'd be Alec the snowman. I can just hear him saying that. Yeah, he was a good man. He was the best. He always made me feel welcome. Like he was happy I was here. I don't know, there's something about this ranch, just... it almost feels like... Home. Yeah. Which is strange because "home" is a word I never thought I'd care about, but... Maybe I do. You know, I feel the same way. Brock and Anya... I think they think I lead this glamorous life, but... actually it can be a little lonely. Really? I figured you had loads of friends. No, I do, I do... I mean, no one as close as Anya, she's-- she's like family. But I guess in Aurora, it's hard to be lonely, because I know everybody... and everybody knows me. Yeah. To Aurora. To Aurora. All right, ready? Ready. Oh. Oh, I love it. I gotta get a picture. You know what? It's better in person. Yeah, let me, uh... try with this. You brought your camera? Of course. Wait. Say cheese. No, not me! No, get the trees, don't get me. Okay, okay, I'll get the trees. No, stop, stop, I don't want you to get me, stop! No, oh, that's perfect. Stop it, I mean it, stop! Okay. Wow. That's actually really nice. That is good. Oh, will you send that to me? I want to send a copy to my folks. Of course. You know, this is the first time I've ever decorated a Christmas tree. You gotta be kidding. No. My mom died when I was a baby, and my dad wasn't exactly a decorations guy. You know, I look back on it, and I think Christmas probably made him really sad and miss my mom. But, he always got me a present. One year, he got me a camera. It was nothin' fancy, just a little point-and-shoot, but I thought it was the greatest thing in the world. I was a pretty quiet kid, and my dad said, "You should let the pictures do the talking for ya." And you know what? He was right. I really got into it. Sounds like a smart man. He was. So, what about you? What's your favourite Christmas present? Oh, flying lessons. 14 years old. Made my parents nervous, but... They knew it was what I really wanted. Well, here's my stop. Yeah. Good night. Good night. Hello? Zoey, I have some promising news. Oh, what is it? Well, there's a boutique hotel firm that scoped out the property a couple years ago. Gus thought about their offer, but he decided not to sell. I'm surprised he thought about it. Well, they're very good people, and he was tempted, but anyway, they contacted me and they wanna arrange a meeting with you. A hotel firm? Well, this might be your last serious offer before spring, it doesn't hurt to talk to them. Alright. Thank you. Hey, Ginny, sorry to bother you. Can I speak to Geoff for a minute, please? Sure, Alec. Geoff? Hey, Alec. Hey. What's up, man? I need a favour. Yeah, sure. Hello? Hi, Zoey, I'm sorry to call at the crack of dawn, but our pilot Geoff Peters can't make it in today, and I'm desperate for a substitute, so I was wondering if maybe-- I'll do it, I can do it! I'll do it! Hey. Hey. Come on in. Thanks. They need me at the airfield right away, but my jeep won't start. Oh, uh, do you wanna borrow my truck? Any way I could borrow your bike? It'd be so much faster, I could take the trail instead of the main road. I told you I can drive anything. Yeah, it's just the trails are a little icy this time of year. Here, let me take you. I'll grab my jacket. Oh, that would be great, thank you. Oh, wow. Did you take these pictures? Oh, yeah. I thought it looked a little bare in here. Here. They're good, people should see them. They're just for fun. Okay, let's get going. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. You okay? Yeah. Thanks for the ride. I'll pick you up. What time? Oh, uh, I don't know, come on in, we'll check with Chuck. Zoey, you are gonna be one popular person today. See, it's the last big postal service delivery before Christmas and you've got six towns on your route. Now, the planes are loaded and itinerary's right here. You're gonna be surprised how many boxes are on board, so it's a good thing you brought a helper. No. No, I'm staying here on the ground. Come on, you'll have a front row seat to the whole sky. Someone's gotta be here to feed the reindeer at six, so I should just go. I can call Brock and have him do that. You could take pictures from the plane. Alec? Zoey, people who don't like to fly really, really don't like to fly. Me? Hey, I'm a flyer, and when I retire that's all I'm gonna do. Oh, come on, you're never gonna retire, you love this job. I'm retiring at the end of the month. Oh, I can't imagine this place without you. Well, look who's a flyer, after all. Let's do this. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ You really think that's gonna help? Got your eyes open, didn't it? All right, now look down. You won't regret it, promise. Wow. That's beautiful. ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ Cessna 714 X-Ray Delta, I do wanna remind you, you are currently on an open channel. Yeah, dully noted, Aurora Unicom. Maybe this isn't so bad. Isn't so bad? Come on, this is the best. So, why do you love flying so much? Well, it's hard to put into words, but I've loved being in the air since my first lesson with Gus. I knew right away the sky is where I belong. See that? Yeah. Flying makes me feel like I'm alive. Next up? Yeah, they brought flu vaccine, thank you so much. Thank you so much, Merry Christmas. Have a good one. Can't tell you how happy I am to get these. We're delivering them tonight. What are they? Us troopers all chip in to make sure every kid in the district gets a present. Everything okay? The company said wrapping included, I thought that meant the presents were gonna be wrapped. I'll never get these done in time. Wait, wait, we only have one more stop. Do you want us to help you? Thank you. I'll show you how it's done. Oh. How are you so good at this? You're the guy that never had a Christmas tree. You never had a Christmas tree? It's a long story. I've had a lot of jobs. One Christmas, I worked for a mail-order company. When you get paid by the package, you learn to be quick. Never a dull moment with this one. All right, so our last stop is in Greenville, but it doesn't say what it is. Oh. Do you know something about this? Reverend said he'd leave it for us in his locker. Leave what? Open it and find out. Gus's Christmas star. Now you have everything you need. Thank you for getting me the star. I just made a couple of calls. That's not all you did. It wasn't a coincidence that Geoff didn't come into work today. Did you talk to him? You got me the Christmas tree, I wanted to get you something, too. Well, thank you. Alec, get your camera. What's happening? Look. It's magic. I've seen the Northern Lights before, but... never like this. Wow. Aren't you glad you came? Yes, I am. And if the lights are here, that means they're gonna be in Aurora soon. In time for the festival, I hope. Me too. So, how are we gonna get that star home? Oh, I'll pick it up from Chuck tomorrow. Oh, okay. Whoa. Did you see that? No. Oh, I thought I saw a reindeer. You don't think Palmer would... No. I didn't see anything. Yeah. I got visions of reindeer dancing in my head. All right. Okay. one sorting, I'm gonna drop a box off at the thrift shop downtown. Do you want me to take a look at the starter on your jeep? Oh, that's okay, I already fixed it. It was just a loose connection. My truck could use an oil change if you get the chance. I won't. Oh! Oh, my gosh, what a mess, sorry. Need some help? Oh, wow. I can't believe he kept them all this time. Wherever I went, I would send Gus and Ida a postcard. Look, this is the one I sent them when I first moved to Florida. "I'm in Tampa, the landing was bumpy. "The pilot needed you for a teacher, Gus. Sending love, Zoey." "Merry Christmas from Florida, Love Zoey. P.S. I'm coming up in the summer to visit for sure." I sent that last Christmas. I never made it up to visit him. Gus knew you loved him. He showed me this. It made him laugh. So, this is the first Christmas I'll be in Florida, and I won't be sending Gus a card. Thought you were staying in Aurora? Christmas is only two days after the festival. Oh, I have to go back Christmas Eve. It wouldn't feel like Christmas if I didn't spend it with my parents. Right, of course. But you are coming back? Oh, you know what? I have to work. Oh. Yeah, yeah, once this place is sold I'm gonna be moving on too. Back to the glacier company. Yeah, they always have a spot for me. Anyway, I'm gonna head to the airstrip and I'm gonna get Gus's star. See you later. Oh, okay. See ya. Hi. Well, looks like everyone's getting back to their old lives. You know what? I wish that I could take this whole ranch and just fly it right back to Seattle, the whole town, but I guess I can't have everything I want. I'm talking to a reindeer. More coffee? Sure. Thanks. You look depressed. I'm not depressed. Alec looks depressed. He always looks depressed. Not since he's been working with Zoey. You need to go talk to him. No, honey. Now. Oh! Hey, how's it going? Getting ready for the big shindig? Yeah. Good, good. It's nice of Zoey to bring that back. Anya asked you to come over here, didn't she? Yeah, I promised her I would, but you don't have to say anything. So, did you catch any of the hockey game last night? Tell Anya I'm fine. You don't look fine. You make good coffee, Brock. I'm gonna miss it. In fact, there's a lot of things I'm gonna miss about Aurora. Just because Zoey's selling the ranch doesn't mean you have to go anywhere. I'm sure we could find a roof and a bed for you somewhere in town. I hear that's important to old people like you. No, soon enough I'll be sleeping in my favourite tent. Thanks for the coffee. See ya. See ya. What did you guys talk about? Hockey. Merry Christmas, Zoey. Merry Christmas. Zoey, so excited for the festival. Oh, yeah, it's in three days. Can't wait! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hi, Zoey. Wow, she had a lot of shopping bags. Yeah, she has five daughters and she was buying them all dresses for the dance. What are you wearing? Oh, I have a sweet little dress from my parents for Christmas. I'll wear that. It's nothing fancy, but it'll work. It's a party, you need a party dress. Like that one. I do like red. Come on. Try it on. Okay. Hi, you want me to come in? Okay. What's going on? I spoke with the hotel company. Can we meet at the ranch tomorrow morning? Sure. So, if you decide to sell us this beautiful property, this is what we propose. Guests will check in at the ranch house and stay in one of 12 unique bungalows. Each bungalow will have its own character and a spectacular view. People will come from all over the world to see the Aurora Borealis in all its glory. Can you pause it, please? Gus and Ida's trees are missing. We wanted to make room for that spectacular view. The trees have sentimental value. Is there any way that maybe they can be transplanted? I'll look into it. Okay, this ranch is really special, so we're gonna need to find a buyer who understands that. I agree. This place is special and we do want to preserve what's here, so, um... let me talk to my team and I will get back to you with a revised proposal and an offer? Oh, sorry. Great. Well, wait and see what they have to say. Yeah, I guess you're right. I was sure you'd be against the sale. I think she meant what she said about preserving the land. And the trees could always be moved. But Gus planted those trees with Ida. I know. Sometimes, things have to change. Hey, and if they buy it, you might get the money in time for the plane sale. Then, I'm about ready to head out into the wild. Aren't you worried about turning into Alec the snowman? No, I'll be fine. And hey, if they do buy it, you won't have to put on the festival, after all. I know, but I want to do it. I think people would really love it, and I love Aurora. So, it would be like giving everybody a gift before I go. Hmm. But, listen, this means a lot of extra work for you too, so it can't just be my decision. I think it would make Gus happy. Let's do it for Gus. ell Zoey that Otto's gonna play Santa tomorrow. Better him than me. That should do it. I hate the idea of moving the trees, and I haven't even found homes for the reindeer yet. Maybe you and Alec could run the ranch as a bed and breakfast. I'm going home, remember? And Alec wants to get back to the wild. It's too bad, you guys seem good together. Anyway, opening a B&B feels like your dream. My dream: flying. Seattle's where I do that. I'm this close to owning my own charter plane. Slow down, you're gonna break the sifter. Sorry. Oh, my God, I forgot the cookie cutter for the gingerbread men! Oh, no, it's a Christmas emergency! Don't worry, Ida has one, I'm sure. One of these drawers. Oh! Gingerbread man... What's this? It's Ida's secret Christmas cookie recipe! Give it to me! And the secret ingredient is... Cornflake cereal. No, it's not. Yes! No wonder she kept it a secret. I'm gonna make hundreds of these cookies, but I want you to swear to me that you will never tell a living soul the secret of the cornflakes. I swear it. Zoey Hathaway, it's sure nice having you back in town. Hello? Hi, Zoey, your reindeer's here again. Oh, no! Well, I'm glad you're here. Palmer's down by the fence as usual. We got one plane circling and he can't land. Zoey, I'm afraid there's gonna be another fine. Rules are rules. No I understand. Not your fault. Palmer, come here. He's tracked onto something on the other side of the fence. How does he keep getting out? I'm not sure, but it's driving me crazy. Maybe he flies. That is the best answer we have right now. What is he seeing? I don't know, I don't see anything. Oh! Well, where did you come from? Sadie, Sadie! Hello. Hi. Is there a reindeer convention I didn't know about? There you are, girl. You gotta stop scaring me like this. Sadie, she keeps coming here. Palmer keeps coming here. It's like they knew each other. Where did you get her? From a guy in Tuscola who was moving out of state. Palmer came from Tuscola. I didn't know there were two reindeer. They must've been a pair that got split up. And they've been coming back here to find each other. Aw. Any chance you've got room for Palmer? And one more sweet old lady named Holly. I wish I did. I've got horses and goats and barely enough room for Sadie. My wife says if I bring home one more animal, I gotta build a bigger barn and a stall for me. We don't want that. Come on, girl, time to go home. Aw, don't look at me like that, guys! You're killing me. I can't believe you took another one. You're supposed to be finding homes for the ones you already have. Palmer and Sadie were looking for each other. They need to be together. Sure. Goodnight, you two. Goodnight. Night. See ya. I'm really glad they got a happy ending. Some couples are just meant to be, huh? We have the whole town coming tomorrow. We still have a lot of work to do. You ready to get up on that tree one last time? I've been thinking about your pictures. How would you feel if we put them up on the wall? Yeah, I don't think so. Why not? Isn't it kinda like showing off? No, they're beautiful, they deserve to be shown off. You really think so? I really do. Let's get back to work. I think we're ready. Yeah, so where is everybody? I don't know. Maybe I was wrong about how excited people were. But not even Brock and Anya are here. I know. Hey. What's going on? A giant tree just fell across the main road. The road crew says that they can't get it moved today. Oh, no. Well, maybe everybody could take the trail. It's too narrow for cars, it would take all day. We're gonna have to cancel the festival. Oh, man! This happened the first year I worked for Gus. It took him a week to get the road clear. Oh, man! Feel better? Little bit. Hey, look at that. What? Hey! People coming. Hey! Hey, Zoey! We heard this party was BYOC. What does that mean? Bring your own cable. Half the town is on their way to help tow this tree out of the road. That's right, we are not missing this festival for anything. I love this town. Who's this now? Mom, Dad! Surprise! What are you doing here? We couldn't do Christmas without you. We booked a flight. We were worried you wouldn't get a seat. But you got a seat. That was no problem, nobody flies from Florida to Alaska in the dead of winter except us. You hate the cold. Yeah, well... We love you more. Here they come! Yes! Ida never gave me the recipe. Are you gonna share? Never. When is Santa coming? Oh, any minute now. Are you sure? He'll be here, I promise. I think Gus's Santa suit will fit you perfectly. Is that wool? Yeah it is, and there's a cape too. Nothing like fake fur and real wool to keep you warm. Otto is allergic to wool, severely allergic. You don't want a Santa with hives. Honey, I'll be fine, don't worry about it. Is there anyone else you can find? No. Please. No. I'm happy to take pictures. We don't need a photographer, we need a Santa. Come on, you don't wanna disappoint all those little kids, do you? All right. Yes! But I'm not wearing the cape. We'll see about that. Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Oh, my sleigh. Santa, you came! I wouldn't have missed it for the world! Oh! Hop on up. I love you, Santa. Well, what do you want for Christmas? Page four is the most important. Page four? You're very prepared. Alec! I had no idea you were so talented. These photos are gorgeous. The one of Zoey is my absolute favourite. Thank you. You're welcome. If you'll excuse me. Hi. You look beautiful. Thank you. Do you wanna dance? Yeah. What a wonderful party, huh? On behalf of the entire town of Aurora, thank you to our host Zoey Hathaway. Oh! Stop, thank you. This is so sweet. Welcome home, Zoey, we missed you. And thank you to Alec Wynn. It took a little while to get to know you, but I think he's a real asset to our town. He put all his time and heart into all of this, and now we know what a great photographer he is! Thank you. So, come on, let's keep on dancing, everybody. Have a great time tonight! Little hot in here, huh? Yeah. You wanna take a walk? Yes, I will go get the coats. Okay. Yeah. Here we go! Thank you. Well done. Thanks for coming, you guys. So, I couldn't find the coat, but I found this. Let me see if I can do it. Oh, wow. I love it. Shall we? Yeah. I think we did good here, Zoey. Yeah I think so, too. Oh, look. It's here in time for Christmas. Zoey! There you are. Oh, my goodness, this festival is wonderful! I want to make it an annual event. You want to...? I'm getting ahead of myself. Can you meet me tomorrow morning? I am ready to make a formal offer. Oh! Well, this is happening fast. Well, it just shows you how interested we are. I've heard all the details. You are gonna be very happy. You're finally gonna get your plane. Wow. These trees aren't going anywhere. I didn't appreciate them until I saw them with the lights. Okay, this is sounding good. Good? This is great. Okay, now, I want you to go and enjoy your party. I need you at the office at 9 a.m. to sign those documents. O-Okay. See you then, Zoey. Okay, bye. Well, it, uh... sounds like you'll be getting your dream, after all. Yeah, it sounds like it could be the perfect offer. Yeah, it really does. Well, um... it's been nice helping you with all this. Yeah, it's been nice working with you. Goodnight, Zoey. All right, Mom, I'll see you soon. You off to sign the papers? Yeah. Hey... For someone who's about to have a dream come true, you don't look very happy. No, I'm happy. Zoey? I'm your mother. I flew 5,000 miles to be with you. Come on, tell me what's going on. You know, I just... I thought I knew where my life was headed. I was gonna buy my plane, I was gonna live in Seattle. My whole future was set forever. Have you changed your mind? I just love this ranch. And I love Aurora. I love that the people here know my name, and they're happy to see me. I love my reindeer. I need to find them good homes. I just... I wish things could be different. Maybe things can be different. Thanks, Mom. I'll see you soon. Hey, is it all right if I invite a few people over for a Christmas Eve open house? Are you asking me for permission to throw a party? I think it'd be nice to have one last celebration here. I think it would be nice, too. You kids have fun. Hey, guys! I'm gonna go see Karen, and then I'll come back and help. Wow. Well, I don't wanna sound like Anya, but you gotta tell Zoey how you feel about her. It's too late. I called the tour company. They got a spot for me if I can get going soon. They're swamped at the diner, I gotta go to work. You gotta tell her how you feel. And you gotta get going. If you get hungry, swing by Otto's. There's always a seat with your name on it. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, Zoey. Best festival ever. Can't wait for next year. Oh, thanks. Hey. It's been so nice having you back home. I wish you could stay. I promise I'll come visit. Make sure you do. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, I'll see you soon. Zoey! Thank you for giving us another festival. It was like having a little bit of Gus and Ida back. I loved doing it. You must be happy to be going back home to your exciting life in Seattle. Yes, yes, I'm really happy. I've gotta run. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Bye. Good morning. Hey. Well, I have your contracts all ready to be signed. I'm really sorry. No, actually, I'm not sorry. I've decided to keep the ranch. I know that this might seem sudden to you, but all the pieces are just kind of clicking into place. I've been travelling my whole life, and I think I've finally figured out where I belong. My heart is here. It's not in Seattle. It's in Aurora. But what about flying? I can still work out of Fairbanks. Fairbanks is four hours away. Listen, it's not perfect, but I think it would be worth it to be able to come home to the ranch. To my ranch. Anyway, I am sorry to have wasted your time. You know what? Life's not all about business. I'm happy you found your home. Thank you. I am, too. Oh, cute! Yeah, I know, the baby will be here any minute, so I just wanted to make sure there was a present under the tree, just in case. Well, if you ever need a babysitter, I'm really good with kids. Yeah? Thank you. Wait, I thought you were selling. Oh, I decided not to. I'm staying in Aurora. You are? Yeah. All right, well, look, with the baby coming I need to be closer to home so I'm taking Chuck's job in the airfield. And that means this town will be short a pilot. What would you say about leasing my plane and taking over my route? I'd say Christmas is coming early. Okay. You all right here? Thank you. Top you off a little. Thanks, darlin'. Of course, Merry Christmas. Okay, what can I do to help? You know what? I think we've got this Christmas Eve feast under control. You sure you're okay? Yeah, I will be. Hey, I was wondering. This is a big ranch, and I think I might get a little lonely with just me and the reindeer. How would you guys feel about helping me run this place as a bed and breakfast? Yes! Really? You would do it? Oh, yeah! The ranch would make a great B&B. Gus gave me this wonderful gift. I think we need to share it with the world. Oh, my gosh. I knew from the moment that we drove up here that you were not gonna sell this ranch. You're gonna be very happy here. Thank you, I think so too. Alec? Sorry to take you away from your party. Can I talk to you for a minute? In private? Um, yeah, sure. I drove 50 miles out of town, and I asked myself, um, "What am I doing?" So, I stopped the truck and I thought about things. What kinds of things? I never put down roots because I was always off chasing the next big adventure. But what if the biggest adventure of all was you and I starting a life together? Doesn't have to be Alaska. Can be Seattle. Can be anything you want. Well, how would you like to build a life with me in Aurora? What? I decided not to sell. I'm keeping the ranch. I would love to start a life with you in Aurora.
