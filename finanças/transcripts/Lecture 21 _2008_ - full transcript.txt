In November 1831 was found, on the banks of a lake a hundred kilometers from Vianna, the frozen body of a master of music that was called Anton Peters, The man was lying in the snow, next to a suitcase, and clutched a violin between the fingers, He did it with such force that it was impossible, then, bury it without its tool, LESSON VENTUNO At the University of Packard nobody had ever seen anyone... with charm and intelligence of Professor Mondrian Kilroy, Many remember it for certain bizarre attitudes... that complicated his relationship with institutions and colleagues, Most of us, his former students... he remembers it for the marvelous anomaly of his lessons, For years, every Monday at the same time... Professor Kilroy he entered the classroom... to tell the students the folly of his research, At first he had thrown himself on the study of curved objects... convinced that they were in them hidden the secret of the universe, He wrote essays on the dynamics of the waves... on circularity of the biblical message... and on the specific weight of the hard egg, In 1984, after a bankruptcy White week,,, conceived a project to whom he dedicated his last years, Draw up a catalog of overestimated works of art, "False masterpieces" called them, He claimed they were 141, His every lesson in those years it was memorable, It was in pieces "Moby Dick" or Emily Dickinson, You should have heard the most beautiful of his lessons... what he called "Lesson 21", It was dedicated to a symbol of European musical civilization... Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony", That was dynamite, We came up with the idea of ​​transcribing it that lesson... based on what we remember and on our notes, It will not be a perfect job, but it is the answer to those who ask us... because we will never forget Professor Mondrian Kilroy, The lesson started with a long silence, Then a man appeared, a violin... and a snowy expanse, Am I already dead? Do not be offended, you can tell me, In your opinion, am I already dead? How are the words? - Which words? - The words of the song, It is not a song, it is a symphony, - Do the symphonies have no words? - Generally not, Does not this have them? - Yes, this has them, - I told you! - It's a complicated story, - Please tell her! Then,,, Have you ever played with someone? My dad liked to play the double bass, then broke it, Imagine there were so many like him with flutes, violins... In short, a bit of everything, Then,,, Now you have to put them in order, Now you should... Those three back there, please... very kind, Now,,, make them play, Courage! Make them play, Wow! - Beautiful, is not it? - Strong! Strong, but what's missing? The voice, They had written some symphony... with the singers coming in at one point, but they were horrendous, The symphonies were made with the tools and they were nice like that, What do the voice and the singers have to do with it? For him the idea of ​​putting ourselves the singers and the choir... Perhaps he thought the sounds of the tools were not enough for him anymore, Pay attention to what I say, with those sounds... he had really done everything, The "Fifth Symphony", People fainted in the boxes, And the "Seventh"? They were crazy, but all bewitched, as if by magic, He wrote eight symphonies and then nothing more... for ten years, When he tried again, came out with the idea of ​​the choir... and singers right in the finale, BUM! The Ninth Symphony, the Ode to Joy... Only he could imagine that... nobody else! - What was his name? - Ludwig van Beethoven, - Would he be the musician? - Yup, - We were waiting for her at the village, - I got lost on... - A kind of meadow full of snow, - It's not a lawn, - No? - He forgot his shoes, - Look! He wants to fill with nonsense the head of that child? - We were talking about Beethoven, - Exactly, It starts with the Ninth and we end with the Ode to Joy... ninety two 00:10:45,40 --> 00:10:49,899 humanity that embraces, God in heaven and similar bullshit, Children are entitled to grow normal, - He knew nothing about the Ninth, - Better! - The Ninth is the highest expression... - About what? He knows why Beethoven wrote that stuff and for who really? Really, for whom? - It slips, - You bend and look at the tip of the shoes... as if they had shit us the alien, - It never happened to me, - It's the trouble of living in the city, - I love living in Vienna, All Vienna went to hear the Ninth and it was a triumph, - He does not know a shit about that story, - I know that... - We have arrived, It's a hole! He expected metropolitan and nightclubs? - Thing? - Come on, he has a lot to learn here, - Red smoke comes out of the chimneys, - When we finish the wood... we burn the children! - Red children, Come, I want to introduce them all, What's this mess? All here, right away... and without stories! Do not worry, they are good people, I present them to him, First I introduce you to Wenzel Simrock, ice master, - Talk softly with him, it's delicate, - Nice to meet you, Then there is Mademoiselle Wenzel Thomson, illuminator master, Fire, candles, torches, stroboscopic, neon, flash... - Children? - Thing? - Anything, Wenzel Schott Wenzel Schott, brothers, They are the best blasters and pyrotechnics in the world, Congratulations, Do not pay attention to the missing arm, they come from the army, Wenzel Broderip, master aviary, Wenzel! Beautiful name, Wenzel Goetz, master of the snow, He will be amazed at what he can do, Madame... Wenzel Boheme, - Very pleased, - Maestro silencer... and in charge of the winds, - Master what? Later he will explain it to him, Wenzel Imbault, ships and ropes, - He's a priest! - Ladies and gentlemen,,, our musician, Anton Peters, Collaborate with him and help him, He is convinced that Beethoven's Ninth is a masterpiece, Silence! We do not have time to joke, We have 45 hours, 13 minutes and 16 seconds and a half, Then it will be late for anything, - Do you want to add something? - He will be my assistant, - He is my son, - Hi Dad! - He will only tell him nonsense, - I reply to Peters, I want to know who my son works with! Remember how it ended with the last musician? - The musicians are all the same, - I have the right... - All right, Mr, Peters, I have to ask you ten minutes of his time, Thomson! Beethoven introduced the Ninth Symphony in the world... the evening of May 7, 1824, in Vienna, Can you tell us what the program was of the evening... what was the outcome of who it was the text played by Beethoven... and what was the topic? He can repeat the questions one at a time? The evening of May 7, 1824 Beethoven presented the Ninth Symphony to the world, What was the evening's program? Of course it was all music of Beethoven, An overture, three pieces of the "Missa Solemnis" and the Ninth Symphony, - The Nona lasted 60 minutes, - What was the outcome of the evening? It was triumphal, The teacher directed the orchestra despite deafness, He was so focused, that when the ninth ended... he did not notice and he continued to direct, The Terese Hunger mezzosoprano he took him by the shoulders... and made him turn, He came out as if by a spell, he looked ahead of him... and he saw the whole theater that applauded, People, knowing that he could not hear... he began to wave of white handkerchiefs, He waved them in a way that that silent image... he could fix himself in the eyes of the teacher, An image that he he would never forget, Very moving, Thank you, Whose poetic text was music by Beethoven? Of the great poet Friedrich Schiller, It was called "Ode to Joy" and it started like this, "Joy, beautiful divine spark, daughter of the Elisei... " "we approach us drunk and quivering to your sanctuary, goddess! " Can you tell us what it was the topic of poetry? I repeat, Can you tell us what it was the topic of poetry? I believe that for Beethoven it was... a hymn to the brotherhood some men, He thought that if we were capable to experience the joy of living... we would all become brothers, we would live in peace... and one God would watch from heaven on our happiness, Can you repeat the last sentence? We would live in peace and one God would watch from the sky... on our happiness, - I want my son back! - That's crazy! - Did you hear? Silence! Mr, Peters... I'm sorry, but he will have to give up the child, BUZZ Shut up, I would be grateful if you would avoid it to pronounce that word... in the presence of the minor, - Which word? - God, - Can I call him "the Creator"? - Or he can avoid calling him, - "Omnipotent"? Leave it alone, We have already lost enough time, At work, now, At work! First thing,,, study things up close, otherwise you do not understand anything, Who was Beethoven when did he write the Nona? A stranger, a madman, the biggest one? All three together, Give me a push, He had been for years the idol of all, They were crazy about his music and it is understandable, Nobody would have thought that with those notes... we could get there where he arrived, - Does she really have a strange violin? - More or less, - He plays alone, but it seems that they are... - More or less, - Even with ice it's like that, - It sounds? - More or less, Beethoven was speed that nobody had thought... the strength of which nobody he had been able... and the poetry to which no one first he was moved, It was not a thing for intellectuals, it worked for everyone, He knows the history of the Congress from Vienna? There were the powerful ones they had defeated Napoleon, They were there to divide the world, a kind of G8, Vienna was the capital of music, They organized many concerts, including an evening dedicated to him, Beethoven prepared a nice program for the occasion, Because they were almost all military, he did a horrible thing... which he called "The victory of Wellington", It was a battle made with the orchestra, the theater came down! It's something that helps to understand the character, If they had invited him at a congress of doctors... he would write a hymn to the thyroid, Then, treacherously, the Seventh Symphony broke away from him, They were there, enjoyed for the battle and he took them away... with that piece of paradise, That was not refined people, They were soldiers or politicians, but it made no difference... he took them away, However, do not come strange ideas, In reality we know little of this matter, When my father died, I went to his bedside... and I asked him the secret, He had studied ice For all life,,, and his father and his grandfather before him, Now he was dying and I asked him the secret of ice, He looked at me and said... "Whatever happens, do not put your tongue on it ", In the end what can be done it's listening, so listen, He feels? It's like a map, He can also look if he wants, but above all listen, Something will understand, Seventh Symphony, Cheerful with panache, The final, At this point the Professor Kilroy did a belch, He really did it, seriously, He was well enough, Then he lowered his voice and solemnly enunciated... the first crucial passage of his reflection, We have a very rare document of that instant, Just a few seconds, but it's worth it, Think about that Beethoven at the top of the charts... and immediately connect us the Ninth Symphony, Imagine it as an apotheosis final, an announced triumph, But, ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that,,, between that Beethoven of which we speak and the Ninth Symphony... ten years passed where everything changed around him, Thousands of days that we we must try to understand, They represent the time that this man he used to go down to hell... a hell that we could define with a single word... What is he doing? Turn off that stuff, right away! The word with which Kilroy called that hell... it was 'empty', He said that for 10 years Beethoven he had only sunk into the void, The second part of the lesson he demonstrated this thesis, It started with mice, Those do not move, Goetz, we'll get old here! Hurry! Sixteen... stay calm! Seventeen,,, - Is the length so important? - Yes, they must be 54 steps, - We must not be wrong, - Will a girl come right? Trust, It will come from the woods and it will stop over there, Do you see the flag? - Yup, - He will look at the 54 steps in front of him, For a moment they will seem to her many, dangerous... and impossible, there we come into play, The secret is that to empty the world, We have to empty the world in front of that girl... to build absolute emptiness, Then you will have the courage to do those steps... and get up to here, my dear teacher! It is always the void to generate the impossible steps... those of which we would never be able to, - Everything is already empty here, - He has no idea what the emptiness is, Twenty-five exact! Beethoven took ten years to build the emptiness around, First he fell into that void, then he started to build it around... like an insect that makes the den, He was famous, rich and requested by the whole world, What empty is it about? He does not understand a shit of this story! - Maybe you do not understand a shit, - Impossible, - Chief, I'm leaving! - They are waiting for me at the market, - Come back before the evening, He should go with him, he can teach you many things, So he also checks it, Wait up! The teacher also comes, Do you have a watch? - I,,, - Keep this up, No, I think I have it, 54 steps! Yup! - Where do we go? - To buy birds, - Why? We use them as signals, At the moment good, let's get them up in the air, - The world sees the signal and he knows he has to stop, - Thing? When a man dies, the world stops for a moment... made of an absolute void, We do not even notice it, but it's like that, - Do you have to die? - Yes, I started... Everything will be fine, - That tree is fantastic! - It's not a tree, it's a market, - In fact, if you sell birds... - Yes, it's practical, Practical, - Do you also have the fish market? - No, no fish, Vienna was full of music of all kinds... but almost suddenly the public he stopped listening to Beethoven, - He was always Beethoven, - Everyone knew him, But something in that music he was suddenly aged, People loved virtuosos, Czerny, Thalberg, They could do anything on the keyboard and then Paganini! He arrived in Vienna and made eight concerts, theater always sold out, His music was not exceptional, but it sounded fantastic, Many believed the devil, He was a clown, exactly what they wanted, Then there were those that made them dance, People came from years of war, he just wanted to be left alone, He wanted to dance and those they made them dance by God! People like Joseph Lanner and then the Strauss, They were good! Do you know how the birds are silenced? It works! Do not ask me why, You could dance too on the Seventh Symphony... but you had to be an angel, It's annoying to say, but in Vienna there were no more angels, However the real shock was Rossini, he and the Italians in general, After the arrival of his music, in Vienna, nothing else was heard, Everything was inside, Virtuosity, rhythm, melody... and above all lightness, what lightness! It was the south of the soul and everyone was waiting for him secretly... from an eternity, - Rossini ties, - Rossini Tournedos, - Stockings, - Cigars, - Toupet, - Ring, When they give your name to your way to shit, you broke! It must be remembered that it did not exist the Beethoven wurstel, It's strange to understand, but if you named Beethoven in Vienna... those snorted, He, Mozart, Haydn had become of the trombones, A bad blow! If you consider yourself a genius, you do not think you're eliminated... from a clown with a violin, For Beethoven Rossini was a pub musician, One day Rossini went to Vienna to find Beethoven, Beethoven told him:"Bravo! Keep writing Barbieri ", "Those can do them well," Virtually kicked him in the ass, But the truth is that Rossini was alive... and Beethoven was dying, I mean in people's imagination, Beethoven had begun to die, They mess up, are not they? - If you want, let's stop them, - No thanks, Can not sleep? There was a kind of... monster, a species,,, It's the kitchen, too rich in fats, I too suffered, but then... You are all crazy, You are all crazy! This country is infested with monsters... that chase me and you listen ice, collect birds... as if the only important thing were those damn 54 steps! You, your mice... and this absurd story that Beethoven was a finished musician, But who told you this? I want to remind you what he wrote at that time... to refresh your memory, Sonatas, Opera 90, 96, 110 and Sonata 111! Did I write 111? Did you write it? No, he wrote it, And the Missa Solemnis? It contains two centuries of sacred music, Do not you make comments? Had you copied it from Rossini? I want to ruin, We want to talk of the last quartets? Do you know what I mean? Quartets! Does this word tell you anything? Have you swallowed your tongue? At least you can tell me who is that zombie... who wanders the corridor? "So I'm about to say goodbye forever and with so much sadness, " "The hope of healing, sooner or later, He definitely abandoned me, " "Even great courage, that often inspired me... " "during the beautiful days in the summer, it is now gone, " "Oh, Providence, let me live at least one day of true joy, " "It's been so long now since a true joy... " "echoed in my heart," "When, God, I can hear it again, in the temple of nature... " "and men?" "Never?" "Oh, no! This would be too cruel, " What the hell is that? Then the professor waved that sheet and said... "The testament of Heiligenstadt", - And she started crying, - It's not true, - Yup! Beethoven wrote it the day he wanted to kill himself, It's understandable, he was in the country, Maybe he liked to think that he would have killed himself, However he wrote the truth, that is, he was not bad... as people thought who detested him, he was only deaf, - Wow! - As if they told you that Michelangelo was blind, But it is true, after 1814 he did not hear plus none of the notes he wrote, People had to write on a notebook what he meant... and then he read, hell! Then the professor said... "You could imagine a worse loneliness? " When he composed at the piano, at his house,,, around he had friends who took care of him, While he was composing with his right hand, with the left hand... With his left hand he was beating, in this way, Fortissimo, He didn't want others to hear, that they stole his music, - Then the professor got up ,,, - Stand up! He said very slowly ,,, "It was like a perfect and fearless one sailboat in a bottle ", Someone had thrown the bottle at sea ,,, and now he was sinking into emptiness, closed in the glass of his silence, That was his way of sailing, That was his way of sailing! Did you catch us all? It is likely that without deafness nothing would have happened, Without silence nothing can ever happen, We are lucky, snow produces silence, Only one thing can fool us ,,, the wind, The noise of the wind, Give it to me, All we have to do it's keeping this little flame steady, He knows what the only thing is who can take the wind out of here? A sailing ship, Mr. Peters, Imbault built it, He's a genius in that kind of thing, - A ship! - It seems, but there's nothing underneath, It would have been enough of the poles and the sails, but Imbault did it this way, He liked the idea of ​​a ship Frozen, In the past it crossed in the Baltic and fished fish sticks, - Thing? - Leave it alone, Do you know what time it is? I can't stand mice, - Imbault, are we ready? - Yup! - We're about to set sail, - What are fish sticks? Imbault! Raise the sails! One day a singer he went to see him at his house, Beethoven asked her to sing a piece of "Fidelio", his work, But she was very young and so excited ,,, to be in his presence ,,, which he didn't take out not even a note, She opened her mouth and nothing came out, Then Beethoven said to her: "Nanette ,,," "You just have to sing, without being afraid, " "I don't feel anything, I wanted to just seeing you sing, " However it never was a particularly windy area, I would have gone to bed very willingly, Really! I also tried, But the professor said it was better not that he was old ,,, - He had a nice way of saying it, - Tell him about the brothel, - No! - Everybody knows, - Exactly, You were always his favorite, - Sometimes the professor she went to hell, - not so, - He went to hell, right? - Yes but,,, - Who accompanied him? You! - Because I had the car, He said he was sad go to a brothel by bus, - So he asked me to accompany him, - You did it! - Yup, Once he asked me if he gave me bother, if it sucked me, I said no, that depended ,, I don't know, I once told him to come to my house, He replied: "Miss, I'm 36 years older than you", "Before I can forget them everyone, she will be dressed again, " Good evening, Ladies and gentlemen,,, 17 hours remain, 14 minutes and 32 seconds, It is not much, but it will be enough, Simrock, The ice says he is tired, but will resist, - Broderip, - 128 birds will fly at the right time, - Boehme, - It is cold here, - Maybe it's the humidity, - Imbault, - Ready to sail, - Goetz, - I was wondering if my son ,,, There are 54 exact steps, snow will do its duty, - It will be something never seen before, - Well, We have to help her to get here, Be careful with the fires, If he does not see the signs, he will be lost, Schott, Thomson, We think 80 explosions are enough, There will be whirlwinds, grenades and pinwheels We will shoot them every 3 minutes, You will certainly see them, I believe you, Mr. Peters ,,, Is everything all right with the music? Well,,, Maybe I should go over it again the whole thing, Then I'll summarize it, He was a completely deaf man, abandoned by his audience ,,, and surrounded by hypocritical friends, He slid into the void of a terrible solitude, for years, But he knew he was the greatest living musician ,,, so, for years, he prepared, and finally he wrote something that would have silenced them all, The others wavered and he wrote the Ninth, His friends organized a concert in Vienna ,,, that had to be his solemn revenge, On the evening of 7 May 1824, Beethoven left home ,,, accompanied from his faithful secretary, Schindler, He was elegant, he was wearing the only tailcoat he had, But unfortunately green! At the last moment he was almost afraid, But Schindler told him that the theater was shrouded in penumbra ,,, and nobody would have noticed the color of his tailcoat, So he went to the theater where he would be challenged everything around him, Imagine with what state of mind entered that room? - He tells it like a duel, - It is, - A duel between whom? - Between Beethoven and the world, Who won? Appointment tonight, Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I've heard three times that lesson ,,, but I only understand it when I went into bowling, - Those strange characters ,,, - You have to explain about bowling, - You know! - I do not know, For some years the professor had gone to live in a bowling alley, - It was an abandoned place, - There lived homeless people, - It wasn't for the money, - No, he had the money, But he said he was fine among those people, It was an isolated bowling alley on the outskirts. closed for so many years, One day, immediately after have taken the degree ,,, I went to see him to see where he lived ,,, the abandoned bowling! I will always remember that day, because everything fell into place, That day I was able to understand what he meant in that lesson, It was a privilege for me, Hey! Be quiet! The first thing they heard he was pure Beethoven, You couldn't be wrong, as a trademark, It was bizarre, it came back after so many years and did the same number ,,, that made him famous, Then people began to understand that there was something new, They were the usual graffiti, but they moved ,,, in a strange way, The music took a step and then he was lost, It practically sank in itself, inside itself, Do you understand? Rampant! A strange journey, from the light, down there, in the darkness, People began to wonder ,,, because he should have followed him in the darkness, It was a music written by God, that's for sure, Technically, it was something wonderful, But it wasn't the kind of music that he could conquer them, He also thought so and didn't put it the Adagio after the Allegro ,,, but decided to entertain them and put the Scherzo, Indeed they had fun, applauded on open stage ,,, but it is important to see at what point they did it, That gable stuff made them mad, SOUND OF TIMPANI They jumped up and applauded until you peel your hands, It was like having cooked a lacquered duck ,,, and see that everyone goes crazy for the boundary boiled potatoes, When the Scherzo ended, the longest written by Beethoven ,,, at one point there was a little phrase idiot repeated 19 times, God knows why 19 times! However when the Scherzo ended, more than half an hour had passed ,,, and they weren't even halfway of the symphony, Then the Adagio began, The curtain was opened, A long beautiful sentence Maybe that was heaven, as he imagined it, Despite the cumbersome echoes of wind instruments ,,, that too seemed beautiful aged music, He moved, but with difficulty ,,, as if he failed to come out of itself, A prison 15 minutes long, Beethoven then had cut 45 minutes of music ,,, without having shown anything, It was old-fashioned music for ten years, Surely it was written better ,,, but if people have learned to go by train ,,, you can't make it come up on the carriage, He fired the last shot before losing the duel, It's crazy how it started the last movement, He attacked three pieces of the movements precedents at that point ,,, even if they had already heard them, Between one piece and another put the double basses to speak, Just talking! They played, but it was like talking, Beside the notes, he wrote what the double basses said, First they listened to the little piece and then they said ,,, "Enough of this shitty music! " Really! You could hear the little piece of the initial Allegro ,,, and then they said: "This no!" "I want something more pleasant," Textual, by his own hand, - And immediately after the Scherzo? - "This can't go either," "Only joke, need something nicer, " - Is not it fantastic? - At the end,,, after spitting on what he had written before ,,, threw down 15 notes on the paper, Nonsense, What do the double basses say? "Here, the music for this day solemn was found, " - They say, - Correct answer, Beethoven had for thirty years in the head that melody, you think! I'll show it to him, look at my hand, You see? It doesn't even move, Baby stuff all in one hand, With that melody wanted to win the duel, He brought out the silence those notes ,,, like a fan that opens, like the rising of dawn, Marta! Then he let his voice in, Men instead of tools and words instead of notes, He could not do more to surprise them, There was no artistic idea behind it, He had to win a duel and took out the atomic bomb, Of course that trick he had to make him sick, In fact he didn't take advantage of it never really, He just couldn't to be a whore, He started everything with that baritone ,,, Joy! Joy, beautiful divine spark ,,, daughter of the Elisei ,,, we enter intoxicated and quivering ,,, heavenly in your temple, An employee of the German Post Office singing while going to work! Maybe it was also of incapacity, There were passages that sincerely ,,, He cut the voices with an ax and I say this with great respect, Kisses gave us and grapes a friend tried to death, The pleasure was granted to the worm and the cherub stands before God, If Rossini had heard something like that, he would get sick, He could also have choked them! As for the words ,,, well! - It was a secular prayer, - Really? "Do you feel the Creator, world? Look for him above the expanse of stars, " "Above the stars you will find it," God always works as an effect, Beethoven was with water in his throat, could not renounce God, But he really believed it, Men on earth, brothers in joy and God over the stars, - It was the world he believed in, - That's not the point, - Remember the will from Heiligenstadt? - Yup, A man kills himself because he understands ,,, who can no longer experience joy, He is deaf, no friends, no women, no joy, - He follows me? - Yup, Thirteen years later, in the day most important of his life ,,, that man chooses to set to music a poem about joy, "Joy, we enter in your sanctuary! " - He had joined the club! - What's this got to do with ,,, Got to do it, believe me, It was like a dream, It was not a prayer, it was a dream, That man had never been happy, He dreamed of being so for God's sake, by fate, He spoke of humanity, not of himself, It makes no difference, the great artists they exchange themselves for the world, - I don't understand shit anymore - It's not true, She understood, It was not a prayer, it was a dream, He dreamed of joy, He dreamed of being one like the others, He dreamed that men they were brothers and not enemies, He dreamed he came into the world to be happy, He had this dream in front of everyone, the night he challenged them all, He was a musician, He did it in music, Joy, beautiful divine spark, daughter of the Elisei ,,, we enter intoxicated and quivering, heavenly in your temple, Your magic rejoins that that fashion has rigidly divided, All men become brothers, where your sweet wing quivers, Your magic rejoins that that fashion has rigidly divided, All men become brothers, where your sweet wing quivers, But who won? That evening, in that theater, who won? If you ask around, will find only one answer, It was a triumph, Everyone waved white handkerchiefs! Actually that was the version of Beethoven's friends ,,, and everyone liked to believe it, But I guess you want the truth, Here she is, Joseph Carl Rosenbaum, He was a traveler, he was cultured, wealthy, That day he was in Vienna and went to the concert, Back home, he opened his diary and wrote what he had seen, "Friday 7, Beethoven Concert, " "Nice, but boring," "Poor public presence, empty boxes ,,, " "no representative of the court ,,, " "little effect on important people, " "Beethoven's supporters They cackled ,,, " "but most of the public remained silent, " "Many have not waited for the end," Voilà, You will wonder why we should believe Rosenbaum, then ,,, The concert ended, Beethoven runs to his secretary, He wants to know how it went, it's about money! He wanted to know how much they had earned at the box office, They told him that at the cash desk there were 120 florins, It was a misery, Beethoven fell unconscious, They left him lying on the sofa because it was not found, I congratulate you, he learned to walk, - Control the shit of the aliens, - You are awake, A few more days with us and she pissed on the Ninth, Two days later a replica was scheduled, First they thought they wouldn't do it, then the manager changed his mind ,,, but he took off some of Missa Solemnis and do you know what replaced it? With an air of Rossini, I swear! Do you know which is the saddest thing? He asked Beethoven's permission ,,, and he gave it to her, However it went wrong, the theater was half empty, Beethoven's friends said that it was Sunday, it was sunny ,,, and the people had gone to the country, Three days after Beethoven invited the people to the restaurant ,,, that had helped him to organize the concert, For the guests he ordered all good things, ,,, then, suddenly, began to scream ,,, to accuse them of robbing him, to have lied to him on the accounts, He didn't want to resign himself to the idea that really had been a fiasco, One by one, his friends got up ,,, and they went away, they were offended, Imagine the scene, Beethoven sitting there, alone ,,, to eat, The table full of food and wine, he alone ,,, sitting there with no one, to eat, Now you decide who won and who lost that evening Listen, He was a genius and the public no, that's why they didn't understand him That is the usual fable and I don't want to hear it, Ten years before the public he understood it well and he was a star, Suddenly had they become stupid? No!
