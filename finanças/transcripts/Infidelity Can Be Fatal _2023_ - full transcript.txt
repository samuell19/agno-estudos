What am I supposed to do now? I'm sorry, Mrs. Cutler. I know these are hard to see. 20 years of marriage. 20. Thrown away for what? A cheap fling? I have leave him now, I mean... I have to leave him. Now, Mrs. Cutler, that's... That's really not for us to say. Well, what do your other clients do? Some people leave, some people stay. Everybody reacts differently. The main thing right now, Mrs. Cutler, is that you have all the information, which means you have all the power. Power? Do I look like I have power? Just because you're hurt doesn't mean you're powerless. You're armed with everything you need to make an informed decision. So you hold all the cards. I just knew that he was messing around behind my back. I knew it. But now that I know for sure... I just feel so worthless. You are not worthless. Hey, you were smart enough to come in here and ask a question you maybe didn't want the answer to. But you did it. And that takes guts. And strength. And yes, being betrayed by somebody you love, somebody you thought you knew; that hurts. But that is not on you. That is on him. It is always on them. Men cheat; they break promises, but now, you get to decide, is this a man that you can learn to trust again? Or do you move on, knowing what you know now? You stand in that power and you make that decision for yourself. You're right. I've done nothing wrong. No, you didn't. Never take the fall for someone else's wrongdoing. I have a lot to think about. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You've been helpful. - 10 bucks says she stays. - Nah. She's gonna bleed him dry. - Lucy Thompson? - Who's asking? My name is Clive Cassel. You came highly recommended. Yes, Mr. Cassel. I believe I spoke to your assistant. That's right. What can I do for you, Mr. Cassel? - Please, call me Clive. - What can I do for you, Clive? I think my wife is having an affair and I would need your help proving it. It's not always the man who cheats... Of course. Uh, please, have a seat. August, aren't you going to join us? No, I've got an interview to get to. You can bring me up to speed later. Sure. Can I get you a coffee? Please. Adriana was my interior designer. We met shortly after I sold my first start-up. We've been together just under eight years now. The first six, happy. The rest... Well, I'm here, aren't I? It was the closest I'd ever come to love at first sight. And now, she's got me wondering whether she ever loved me at all. A lot of people wonder that when they suspect their spouse is cheating. Right. So, what initially made you question her fidelity? Oh, the usual stuff, I guess. Gradually, throughout the years, I could sense her pulling away. I know I can take some of the blame for that, I travel a lot for work and she's always busy too. It's hard to find time to be together. But when we do make the time, it's... different. Different how? Well, for starters, we stopped having sex. And she became difficult to get a hold of, screening my calls, she started having private conversations behind closed doors. She never used to do that. She's an interior designer. What could possibly be so confidential? Do you need me to continue? No. From the sounds of it, you're completely justified in feeling the way you do. Oh, thanks. It's nice to know I'm not losing my mind. You're not. In my experience, it's always best to trust your instincts. Well, it'll be a relief to finally get to the bottom of this. Whatever the truth is. I understand. So, how does this work? Do I have to sign something? Uh, do you have any questions for me? Am I the first investigator you've met with? No. I met with Rudy Davis last week. - Oh, Rudy. How'd that go? - He's a hack. - Wasn't gonna say. - I've done my research. I've explored a few other options and... I want you. What makes you so sure? Let's just say I'm trusting my instincts. I'll have August send over a contract and we'll go from there. Wonderful. Thank you. - Hey, Cami. - Happy almost birthday. Do you have to remind me? What would you do without me? Not have a birthday party, for starters. Oh, don't be such a party pooper! This is your 35th! We have to do something special. I've kind of invited someone I want you to meet. You know I don't do setups. Look, sweetie, I know you don't trust anyone. I get it. You're exposed to a lot of bad guys doing what you do every day. But, not everybody cheats. I mean, just look at Charles and I. If you just let someone in, just for once, maybe you can be as happy as we are. How bad could it be? If I'm wrong, I will leave you alone. No more setups. Hello? You there? Alright, fine. You can invite him. Yes! But if he turns out to be another dud, you leave me alone? Scout's honor. - I'll see you Friday. - Love you! Love you too. - Who you texting? - Just Lucy. You ever meet Adriana or Clive Cassel at the CATC ball? Not that I know of, why? Must be for a case or something. Uh, I got to get to work. Hey. I love you. Love you, too. Hey! Uh, just my usual. And uh, a round for my friends. I can't believe it, she's wearing a dress. Nice. I should set you up on blind dates more often. No, you shouldn't. This was so much work. - Can you grab...? - Yeah. - Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday, Lucy. You guys! I love them! These will come in handy! Thank you both so much. So, tell me about Mr. Wonderful. What? Remi? Well, he's... He's... He's wonderful. Unless you're already spoken for, that is. I'm pretty sure he's kind of the monogamous type. Oh, that is August, my new associate, wishing me a happy birthday. He has been a lifesaver, I honestly don't know how I did anything without him. Thank you. Well, cheers. To best friends. Thank you guys for doing this. - We love you, Lucy. - Cheers. So, seriously, tell me about this guy. What's wrong with him? Why is he single? Well, I occasionally snore, casually drink and I may have a slight shoe fetish. Uh, well, those look like regular old shoes to me. I like her. Remi. - Lucy. - Nice to meet you. Well, there it is, ladies and gentlemen. Love at first slight. Hey, I'm just really glad the two of you got off on the right foot! - Ugh! - Wow. - Yeah. - What? Well, what do you think? He's nice, right? He likes you, he asked me for your number. I will admit, I had a good time. So, you gonna see him again? Charles can 100 % vouch for him. - Cami, I don't know. - Take a chance! Life is full of unknowns, but risks like this are worth taking! Lucy, how many times do I have to tell you they are not all bad guys? Okay! Fine! If you stop badgering me, then I'll go out with him again. Now wasn't that easy? Your chariot awaits. Ladies... Thank you. Sorry, boss. Didn't mean to scare you. - That lunch? - Yeah. - Then, I won't fire you. - Thanks. If you need anything else, I'll be at the office. Thank you! Where are you going? And who might you be? Surprise! Thank you for meeting me. Of course. What are you drinking? Uh, I really shouldn't. I'm charging you by the hour, remember? Uh... Manhattan. On me. Thanks. So, uh... Sorry to say I've been tailing Adriana for a week and I have nothing to show for it. Oh? There's no suspicious activity. Her phone log is clean, she goes to and from work most days, consultations, a homecoming party... I don't know what to tell you. I don't think you need to keep me on. Well, I appreciate your honesty. Thanks. But, I want you to stay on. You would? She's up to something. You've only been on the case for a week. I'm sure if you stay on longer, something will come up. Call it intuition. You really don't trust her. Well, a wise woman once told me to follow my instincts. Typical. Someone you know? No. Turns out, I don't know him at all. And what does that mean? You don't want to know. Try me. Okay. Um... We met last week. Thought he was interested. Well, for what it's worth, he's obviously an idiot. Thank you. But I'm the idiot. I let my friend convince me to let my guard down despite my better judgement, I did. Serves me right. No one deserves to be deceived. I know that better than anyone. Look at what I do. Right. So, what got you into all of this? Private investigating? Well... My dad left when I was little. Ran off with his secretary, believe it or not. Blindsided my mom, left her with nothing. Just seemed like the best way to make sure it didn't happen to someone else. - So, it's personal. - Yeah. That and I always thought I had killer instincts. Until now, that is. Oh hey, don't let this guy make you doubt yourself. We all misjudge people once in a while. I should have known better. This is why I don't date. Ever? I always saw trust as a weakness. That's a little harsh, don't you think? This coming from the guy who asked me to follow his wife? I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. No, don't apologize, you're right. Well, I should get going. Thank you for the drink. - Stay. - I really shouldn't. Don't make me eat alone. So, you don't eat alone. What's that about? Oh I didn't say I don't. I just prefer not to. What? Is that so hard to believe? I don't know, I just had you down as the independent type of guy. Oh no, you've got me all wrong. Total codependent. - Really? - I'm kidding. Though, I'm starting to think no one is as independent as you. How do you figure? You live alone, you don't date ever, you see trust as a weakness. Okay. Point taken. But come on, there must be someone you can trust. Cami. We've been best friends since college. She's been by my side despite my... intensity. Through thick and thin, no matter what. For years it was me and Cami against the world. Was? She married her husband Charles a few years back. Charles? And how do we feel about Charles? At first, I had my doubts, as you can imagine. But he's actually become a really good friend. And they're great together. They're like the perfect couple. If there's anyone who could convince me that... Never mind. What? No, it's nothing. It's stupid. - Come on, say it. - No. Really. You know I won't let up. You are shockingly persistent. I was just gonna say, if there's anybody who could make me believe in true love, it would be them. That was even sappier out loud. I think it's nice. I'm starting to think you're more of a romantic than you let on. You're sure it was him? - Positive. - Damn, Luce. I'm sorry. I totally misjudged him. Yeah well, I did too. I'm just glad it ended before it even started, you know? What were you doing at The Waverley, anyway? I was meeting a client. At The Waverley? Fancy. Yeah, well, he insisted. Actually, he um... He made me feel better about the whole thing. We had dinner, talked. It was nice. Having dinner with a client? I never would've thought I'd see the day. Like I said, he insisted. Hey, Luce. Cami mentioned a Cassel the other day, is that the client? His name is Clive. I don't know, there's like something about him. I just feel like I can talk to him. Are you sure this is a good idea, Lucy? Fraternizing with a client? He's obviously going through a lot. Maybe you should just move away from this one. What are you talking about? A job's a job! They just had dinner. What's the big deal? He's a married man, Cami. What do you even know about this guy anyway? She's a professional, babe. She's done her due diligence. Right, Luce? Obviously. Look, I gotta get ready work. I'll talk to you guys later. Bye. What? I really don't think it's a good idea. She knows what she's doing. You're right. Okay. Love you. Oh, hey, I've got that meeting tonight. So I'm gonna be home late. Okay? - Yup. Love you too. - Bye. Have a good day! Good work everyone. Keep it up. Let's go! Let's go! Train hard, let's go! Again! Alright, let's go, come on. Hard, let's go. Come on, train hard. Cross, jab, cross, jab. Come on! Cross, jab, cross, jab. One, two, three, four! Good, keep going. Come on, come on! Hey, Clive, you made it. Come in. - Sorry I'm late. - It's all good. Alright, let's go. Come on, guys, let's go! Come on, guys. Let's keep training! Let's go, let's go, come on! Train hard, let's go, come on! Ten more, come on! Next combination. Let's go, Lucy! Come on, hard! Come on! Don't slack off. Come on! 10 more! 10 more! Let's go! Okay, listen up, time to pair up. Try and team up with someone you haven't worked with yet, okay? Let's go, find somebody. Let's go, come on, don't waste time. Hey! So what do you say? Partners? - Sure. - Alright. Jab, cross! Again, two more times. Jab, cross. Let's go, let's go! Okay, next combo, Lucy, next combo. Right cross, left hook, right cross. Don't give up, come on, everybody! Come on, I see you slacking back there, come on! Get your ass in gear, let's go, come on, guys! There it is, yeah, you got it. That's quite the right hook you've got. It comes in handy. You'd be surprised the number of unsavory characters I've had to use it on. I don't doubt it. I've never seen you here before. New hobby? That obvious, huh? You held your own. Yeah, well, I'm thinking about investing in the studio. So, figured I'd come check it out. And? I can definitely see the appeal. Well, I should get going. I don't want my employer to think I'm slacking off. Yeah. Of course. Nice running into you, Lucy Thompson. Have a good night. Thank you. I know you're following me. I don't want to hear it, I know Clive put you up to this. You're not the first person he's hired to chase me around town. He's not who you think he is. I'd be careful if I were you. Dean Calvet plus one, bar. Clive. Hi. Hi. I hope I'm not calling too early. No, not at all. I'm actually at the office. Wow. The reviews online weren't kidding when they said you were dedicated. I was going to see if you wanted a coffee. Yeah, actually, that would be great. Um, there's been a development with your wife, I'm just not sure what it is yet. Do you know a Dean Calvet? Uh, no. Why? She had dinner with him last night. I was hoping maybe you knew who he was. No. I've never heard that name before. I've got a couple photos. Maybe you could come by and identify him? Absolutely. I'll be by shortly with your coffee and take a look. Great. They didn't so much as kiss goodbye. So they're definitely not romantically involved, but she did hand him an envelope right before he got in the Uber. So you're right, there's something going on, I just don't know what it is yet. Well, I don't recognize him, but... What happened after the envelope? He just got in the Uber and then I followed her home. What? So, you were at my place? Yeah. Why? Did you see me? Yeah. She came in, went straight to the kitchen, kissed you. That's when I left. Lucy... Nothing happened. It doesn't matter. She's your wife. We're not in love anymore. Then why do you care if she's having an affair? Why don't you just leave her? It's not that simple. I need to prove she's cheating or else she'll fight me for everything in the divorce. So, it's about the money. It was... But it's not anymore. What's it about? Lucy... it's about you. I think you should go. Yeah. Right. I'm sorry. - No. I'm sorry. - It's just... I've never felt this way about anyone. Clive, I... What? I can't cross this line. I understand. I'll go. I'll let you know if I find anything else about your wife. Yeah. Lucy! Sorry I'm late. The line-up at the coffee bar was nuts. Damn hipsters! I'm in here. Come on in. Oh, Mr. Cassel, good morning. I'd have brought you a coffee if I knew you were here. Clive brought coffee. I got some pictures of this guy last night and Clive was kind enough to drop by last minute. Thanks, August. I really do need to get going. - Thanks for coming by. - Not a problem. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good. Dean Calvet. Got these photos of him with Adriana Cassel last night. I need you to help me figure out how they know each other. Okay. I'll do some digging. Ah! Okay, you ready? Come on, let's go! Jab! Double jab! Good, okay. Ready? Let's go, fast! Right hand Duck! Here we go again! Ah! - I'm so sorry! - What's wrong with you?! I was distracted, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, it's okay. Alright, everyone, let's switch partners. Come on, let's go! Charles? Charles! Luce! Hey. What are you doing here? I just finished boxing. Why are you on this side of town? Oh, I'm just meeting a potential client. - Here? - Yeah. He insisted. He owns a couple of these places. Ah, an underground gambling ring leader. Say no more. Yeah. That's why they pay me the big bucks. - Well, I won't keep you. - Nice seeing you. Hey, Luce? Would you just mind not telling Cami about this? You know how she worries. - Sure. Okay. - Great. Hey! I just don't think this is something John Cutler would be capable of. Yeah, me neither, just doesn't fit the profile. Well, then, it leaves us with Dimitri Alexander. What's his story? Last I checked, Dimitri was in jail. Okay. What happened? I put him there. This was years ago when I was doing surveillance for the police department. They had me tailing him for weeks to gather evidence against him in a drug-related incident. Turns out he wasn't just into drugs. He had a thing for beating his wife. I testified against him. Put him away for a long time. Well, interesting. What? Well, it says here Dimitri Alexander was let out on parole last week. - Are you kidding me? - No. Wait a minute, where you going? I'm going to El Caballito. That's the bar he used to run his business out of. Hold on. I'm not leaving this to the cops. They couldn't put him away without me last time. I'm not trusting them to do it now. Okay, Lucy, sit down. Please. Listen, just leave this to me, alright? Take the day. I will go through the files, I'll come up with some questions. It's not gonna get us anywhere if you go over there and get hurt by a violent wife-beater who has a personal vendetta against you. You're right. Now, go home, take the day. You've been through a lot. I can't go home. I've got to get back to the Cassel case. Adriana's supposed to be going out of town with her sister tonight and I still don't know who that guy was she went out for dinner with the other night. Lucy, breathe. I'm sure Clive will understand if you take one day for yourself. Who's there? It's Clive. Hi. What are you doing here? I just needed to see you. You alright? Hey... I don't know what to do. I don't even feel safe in my own home anymore. It's completely understandable. Someone breaks into your house and with this Dimitri guy out there... Yeah. And then, there's the nightmares. I feel like I'm losing my mind. You're not losing your mind, Lucy. Hey. Look at me. You're being personally targeted. This is stressful and scary and this guy is obviously deranged. Something like this would be enough to rattle anyone. So what do I do? You could get out of town for a few days. At least until August gets some information out of this guy. So what, just... up and leave? What about your wife? What about the case? You know, Adriana is out of town with her sister for the next few days. Or so she says. This could be our smoking gun. Don't you want to know where she's really going? She's going to Vale to see her sister and her nieces. She goes every year, she'll be posting about it all weekend. Yeah, but... You can take a break from the case, Lucy. Seriously. It can wait. Well... Where would we even go? Trust me. August, hi. I'm just calling to let you know that Dimitri no longer runs his business out of El Caballito. - Damn. - No, no, it's okay. I've managed to find where his new front is. It's a nightclub called The Blue Grotto. I'm gonna pay him a visit later tonight. Nice work. I should come with you. No, no. It's better if I go alone. He doesn't know who I am and he won't know I'm connected to you in any way. Right. Okay, well, be careful. Yeah. Of course. I, uh... I should let you know I'm gonna be out of town for the next few days. Oh. That sounds great. That should be good for you. Yeah. At least until you get something out of Dimitri. Yeah. Couldn't agree more. Where you heading? A cabin in Meadowbrooke. Nice. You're renting? No, it's... it's a friend's. Nice friend. I've heard there's some pretty fancy cottages out that way. Yeah. For sure. You okay? All things considered? Yeah. I'm good. Alright. Enjoy the countryside. And... I'll give you a call after I talk to Dimitri. Sounds good. Everything okay? Yeah. I don't know... I just feel like he knows I'm hiding something. Well, I wouldn't worry about him. You're the boss. If he finds out, he'll just have to deal with it. This is amazing. Thanks. It's been in my family for generations. Oh, it's one of my favorite places. Thank you for bringing me here. - Name? - Hey. No. I'm not on your list. I'm here to see Dimitri. No one gets in if they're not on the list. I'm one of his business partners. He's expecting me. Yeah, well, Dimitri is not here right now. Oh yeah? Why don't you let me go inside and have a look for myself? Like I said, no one gets in if they're not on the list. Right. Dimitri. I need to talk to you. Damn! Hmm. So, what do you think? Oh, I'm sorry. You're obviously still a little on edge. Well, why don't I put on a fire and you can pour us some wine? - That sounds great. - Okay. I'm sorry. What? I'm just looking at you. Oh, my God. That smile is gonna be the death of me. What is it about you? What do you mean? I never let my guard down. But around you... I know I just met you. I don't know, it just feels like... Like an instinct? Yeah. Come on, Dimitri. I know you're down there. What do you want, man? I just wanna talk to you. What do you wanna know? Where were you the night of April 27th? Let me phrase it another way. Did you break into Lucy Thompson's house? Yeah. Why? I was paid by some guy to mess with her. That bitch ruined my life, seemed like a win-win. Someone paid you to break into her house? Yeah, some guy named Clive, gave me 10 grand, said it was time for the hunter to become the hunted or some crap like that. Clive... Hey! Who are you? Who the hell are you? Lucy, pick up the phone. Hi, you've reached Lucy Thompson... Lucy, pick up the phone! Please leave a detailed message and I'll get back... Meadowbrooke? - Good morning. - Good morning. How are you feeling? I'm feeling a lot better. This place has that effect. I think you have that effect. Do I? Coffee? Thanks. I'll be right back. Come on. - There you are. - Hey. Ooh. Didn't mean to sneak up on you. Everything okay down here? No! August left me a voicemail and I can't check it because I have no signal. Yeah, the reception here is pretty awful. I don't know what to do. This could be important. It could be about Dimitri. I shouldn't have come here. Oh, hey, hey. It's a good thing you came. You needed this. Remember? I need to get back to the city. I know where we can get a signal. Come on. Try now. Two bars. That should do it. You don't have to wait for me if you don't want to. No, I'll wait. I want to know what he said. What did he say? Lucy, hey! Hey! Lucy, what did he say? Lucy! Just talk to me! It was you! You paid Dimitri. I can't believe I trusted you. I've never even met Dimitri. Lucy, stop! I love you. Oh, my God. No! Oh, my God! Lucy! What did you do? Come on. Thanks. What's going on? Self-defense. They're not gonna hold me. Great, then come on. Let's get out of here. So... you were sleeping with the client. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to make sense of all this. It was stupid, I know. I can't talk about it right now. Okay. Thank you... for warning me. Who knows what would have happened if I'd stayed there with him. Hey. We're in this together. Lucy, where the hell were you? I tried calling. Thank you for being there. Of course. Get some rest. Uh, August, this is my best friend Cami. It's nice to finally meet you! Pleasure to meet you. I should go. Call me if you need anything. I will. What's going on? Clive's dead. What?! It was an accident. I was defending myself. He wasn't who I thought he was at all. I was at his cabin. He was the one behind the break-in. He was after me the whole time. Oh, honey. Let's get you inside. Come on. So, what happens next? I don't know. But right now, we drink. Hey. What's going on? You okay? I'm fine. I'm sorry. You don't need to hear this right now. Cami, something is clearly bothering you. Talk to me. You've just been through so much. Now is not the time. I'm here for you, always. What's going on? It's Charles. What about him? I just... I think I might need to hire you. You think Charles is cheating? Where is this coming from? He's been acting differently. Going out to see clients, coming home at five in the morning. I never know where he is. His job has always been demanding, though, right? Not like this. These past few weeks, he's been totally withdrawn. He can't even look at me, let alone touch me. The other day, he came home blackout drunk with a busted lip. I think he might be gambling now. I just... I don't know what to believe. When was that? Thursday, I think. Why? Okay, I'm gonna tell you something and I need you to understand that it did not seem like a big deal at the time. What do you... What do you mean? What are you saying? I saw Charles in the Slaphouse District on Thursday. You what? He said he was meeting a client. He asked me not to say anything. So you listened to Charles over telling your best friend? He said he didn't want you to worry. I had no idea. Lucy, this is huge! How could you not have said anything? I didn't think there was anything to say. Obviously, I was wrong. This might explain his behavior for the last few weeks. Cami, I'm sorry. I have to go. Hey. Let's figure this out together. Honestly, Lucy, I think you've done enough. Lucy, talk to me! It was you! You paid Dimitri. I can't believe I trusted you. I've never even met Dimitri. Lucy, stop! I love you. No! Lucy... I wasn't expecting you today. I need to figure out what the hell is going on. Okay, he hires you to follow his wife, so he has tabs on you at all times, then, he seduces you, then hires Dimitri to terrorize you. Yeah. I've been going over it again and again. And I just keep asking myself "why". I think it all goes back to this sick obsession. It's clear that he had this fixation with you. Yeah. But he had me. Yeah. Not until after the break-in. He kept insisting that he'd never seen Dimitri in his life. Hey, it's perfectly normal to second-guess yourself after such a traumatic event. But, Lucy, you did what you had to do. Who knows what he might have done to you? I don't know. The more I replay it in my mind, the more I think he just was genuinely confused. Like, he had no idea about the break-in or any of it. Yeah, well, the only way to prove that would be to ask Dimitri. August, there's a lot that's not adding up. Dimitri is the only one that can answer these questions. Okay, you're the boss. I'm going with you. Good. Nice place. Yeah, you should've been here last week. What are you looking at? Nothing. Huh, great. You know him? Yeah. Let's just say that. Well, look who it is. Yeah, good to see you. I should have known you two were working together. - Hi, Dimitri. - What do you want? I need to tell me who hired you to break into my house. I already told this guy. His name was Clive. You mean this guy, Clive? What do I get for ID'ing this person? Why should I help you? If you don't cooperate, I press charges and you get sent away again, for a very long time. I've never seen this guy in my life. - You're sure? - Positive. The Clive I met was shorter... Trying to grow a moustache. Leave me alone. It doesn't make any sense. It's... It's just not adding up. Hang on a sec. Lucy! You okay? I'll be right out. What have you done? I killed him. I killed the wrong guy. You thought you were in danger. Anyone else would have done the same thing. He was in love with me and I killed him. How could I have gotten everything so wrong? Wait a minute. Maybe you were supposed to. Hear me out. Whoever got Dimitri to break into your house knew you were going to find out it was Clive, and then that you would confront him. You think Adriana would have wanted him dead? He was a very wealthy man. People do bad things for money. Really bad things. Got any pings on that guy she went out for dinner with the other night? None. What was the description of that guy Dimitri actually met? Can you see if there's anything there? - Alright. Will do. - I'm gonna go to The Regent. That's where he was staying. See if I can get any info there. Okay and I'll go to Adriana's, see if I find anything. - Be careful. - Yeah, you too. Lucy? Lucy! Lucy saw you with him. We'll deal with her later. Did you get the passports? You are now... Vanessa Armando. Do you think I can pull it off? Did you... drain all of his accounts? Now that Clive is dead, it all belongs to us. Did you use the routing number that Dean set up? Right... the routing number. Adriana, that one's untraceable, right? We cannot leave until the funds are in that account. I'm sorry! I put the funds in my account. I didn't think it would matter. Well, it does! You want people to be able to find us? What's your password? I think someone's out there. Adriana, your password. Want some more wine? Of course. To us. To us. I love you so much. I cannot wait to start this next chapter of our lives. Together. Finally free, without Cami or Clive. Just you and me, together. Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen. What? He's changed all his passwords. After everything I've been through to get here. The strings I pulled! Clive is dead! Don't lie to yourself. You wanted him gone. If he would've found out about us, he would have left you with nothing. The money. What are you doing? I'm stopping the funds transfer. Hey. I can't let you do that. This isn't your money, Charles. What did you do? But I love you. Oh no. No, no, no. Hi, you've reached Lucy Thompson of Thompson Investigations. Please leave a detailed message and I'll get back to you shortly. It's me! I'm sorry I overreacted the other day. I should not have blamed you for what Charles has done. It turns out he was hiding a lot more from me than I thought. I'm kicking him out! I love you. Call me back. Lucy. Hey! Lucy! Lucy! Damn it! August! It was Charles and Adriana. I think he killed her. Call me when you get this. Cami! I'm here. Okay. Hey... Hey, listen. I just watched Charles kill Adriana. - What are you talking about? - He wants to kill me now. Let's go. Lucy! Cami. Get out! - What?! No... - Get out! Cami, no, I can explain. Don't listen to Lucy, she's crazy. I know you're cheating on me, Charles. And the gambling? I know we're broke! You are the reason Clive is dead! No. Lucy is trying to tear us apart. She's always been jealous of what we have! You're a murderer and I need you to get the hell out of my house and out of my life. Get out! This is all your fault! No, Charles. This is your fault! You're going to prison! Don't listen to her. Just don't listen to her, okay? I came back. Look at this life we have, huh? I did this to protect that. I did it all for you. You're insane. You don't understand, Cami, look. Look, just forget everything. Alright? Yeah? I solved our money problems. Okay? We can be happy together. I love you. Okay, Charles... It's over. Charles, wait! Stop! 911, what is your emergency? Listen to me, listen to me. You came back. That's all that matters. Hey, hey! You did what you had to do for us. Look at me. I see that now. Okay? Alright, baby? For better for worse, right? Yeah. Lucy! Lucy! Ah! You're okay. Hey, it's okay. This guy was fast. I was out of breath. I've got news! They love it. Uh... Who loves what? - The publisher? - They literally want to buy the rights to your story after reading the first twenty pages. Lucy, this book is going to be huge. - Seriously? - Yeah. Our story is incredible. People are going to want to hear it. This is so exciting. How is the rest of the book coming? It's going really well. It's been cathartic putting it all down on paper. So, wait, what happens now? Well, the publishers are going to send over a contract and all you have to do is sign! You are going to love the deal I got you. I don't doubt that. You're a shark. I am, aren't I? So I'll see you for dinner tonight? You know it. Are you coming, August? Of course. I'll be there. Amazing. Love you. Love you. Wow. Lucy, congratulations! Yeah, she thinks we've really got something here. Yeah, so do I. And I, for one, can't wait to read it. I have a feeling we're about to get very busy. Yeah. I think so! Ready to dive in, partner? I will do you proud, Lucy Thompson. I know you will. Now, go back to work.
