- Simi. Hey. - I missed you. - Simi. Simi! - Welcome home, Theo. - Hey! Where's our son? Where's Nico? - At his bungalow. - Oh, I see, ah. - Mr. Tomasis! - Hey, Mia. Is Nico here? - I haven't seen him. - I thought you knew. Oh, poor baby. - Darling. - Oh, naughty Paola, come here. Come talk to Nico, - Theo. What happened to Zurich, Theo? - Nothing, you were in Zurich and I was in South America. - But I was there to week waiting for you? - Not alone you naughty girl. - Yes, but nobody is like you. - Hey, maybe next time in Paris, huh? - Oh yes. Paris would be lovely. Paris is my favorite. - When are you going to Paris, Paola? - Oh in a few weeks, Simone. - Can you wait and I'll join you? First we're going sailing, Theo, Nico and I just a few of us. It will be at least a week on dragos. It will be lovely to go away for awhile. - Theo. Theo, you are back from the sea. You love me, Theo. - Why do you think to ask me? Your my brother's wife. Why do you ask? - Who doesn't she ask? - Why didn't you wait for me? - Because my great brother wanted you for me. Come on, Theo. - You should have waited for me. - Maybe I should of. - Hunting whales for Christ's sake. What for, what did is the sense to it? Sit down, I have something to tell you. You know the Selena, brother? - What about the selenas? - A beautiful ship, the Selena. You always wanted her, huh? - I saw it once, I thought it was kind of small, no? - The papers come tomorrow. I sign them. We go to beyraos. I'll give you a ride. What do you say? - Go to her, spyros. Go take care of her wife. - I wish I could lend her to somebody. - So you could rent that black girl again? She tells people that you scream obscene things in bed. Ah, spyros, spyros. It's so bad for the family name. Nico! - Papa. - Nico. - Welcome home, papa. How are the whales? - Big. Hey, how are you, huh? How's it going? - It's okay. - Okay, yeah. - Yeah. - Everything is, everything is okay? - Yeah. - And the, the girls. Are they teaching you? God damn it, son. It's great to see you. - You, too, papa. You, too. - Hey, you know that prick brother of mine? He says he's buying the Selena. Fuck him. We'll buy it, right out from under his ass. What do you say, do you like that? - Between you and uncle spyros. - No, no, no it's for you. I'm gonna buy it for you. - What do you mean for me, why? - What do you mean? So you own a beautiful tankers. So my son will start his own fleet, so you'll get into business like your papa. Come on, what's the matter? What's the matter with starting by owning a tanker? - Nothing. - What do you want to do? You want to bust your ass on docks like me? You want to roll in cars with a spit, like me? Nico, I did it all, enough for both of us. - Okay, okay. You let me start my own business my way. - Come on, let's sit down. Tell me, what you, what is your idea? - Idea. Let me buy the tanker, not you. - Oh. - Come on, let me prove I can do it without you. Let me negotiate for it, let me deal, bargain, all of it, but me. - Okay, you buy the Selena. - Either I make it happen myself or I fall on my ass. - On your own. - Deal? - It's a deal. Let's go have a drink. Hey, but a little advice from your old man, is okay. I mean, no, no. Just this much advice. Now you call costopolos in salonika. Whatever his deal is with spyros, tell him to cancel and you bargain and you, you set a fair price. But if he says no, tell him the Greek government will see those papers in my safe. - No, that's blackmail. - Blackmail bullshit, son. That's commerce. You be nice. Costopolis is no friend. Let there be no doubt about the papers in the safe. But you, you be nice. - Theo. Theo, you haven't met senator Cassidy and Mrs. Cassidy. - Mrs. Cassidy. - How do you do? - Mr. Tomasis. - Senator. - Thanks so much for the afternoon. - You're getting ready to leave? Why do you have to leave, why? - We must. - Oh. We're making a party tonight on my boat. Robert will be disappointed. He wanted to meet you, he asked. Uh, Robert Keith. - Robert Keith? Yes, he's coming in from cypress, tonight. - James, we've already made other arrangements. - I'm sure they'll understand, Liz. - Ah, wonderful. Anytime after dark, I will send a boat after dark. - I look fonnard to it, thank you. - Mrs. Cassidy. Until tonight. - See you later, goodbye. - Goodbye, simi. - Goodbye. Theo, Robert didn't ask to meet the senator. Is the senator such an important man? - Oh yes, very. - That was our policy at potsdam. Churchill insisted on it. It was your president, your Mr. Truman who was all one thing one day and another day the next morning. - Mr. Truman told me, it must of been years later, that at potsdam, his one experience with Stalin, he wanted to feel him out, learns Stalin's attitude. - My boy. When I was prime minister, Mr. Truman told me that he knew Stalin had broken 47 treaties since he came into power. - Why point to Truman? At potsdam, you all fucked up. - Fucked up? - Yeah, fucked up. - Rather graphic. I've never heard it put that way before. Fucked up. - Excuse me. Robert. Robert, wait. I'm sorry, I apologize. I'm a peasant, a vulgar peasant. I'm uneducated and I shouldn't of said that. - Theo, you're not a peasant, you're not uneducated. You're a very intelligent man. I am not angry with you, I'm angry with myself. What you said just now was the truth. We did fuck up at potsdam. Where can I have a pee? - Go down, straight down to your left. - I love you all! I love you. - Get your ass up here and stop making so much fucking noise. Matalas, how is your film? Mr. Tomasis. - Theo, is our music. Let's dance. Oh come on. - And de gaulle, he uh, he did not like plebin. No, he preferred delatie. - Exactly right. - Still politics, huh? He can go on for hours. - Atour just before the collapse. - Would you like to see the boat? - On the sardines. - Come on, I'll show you. - Did you know about that, James? - No. - Well, there he was, de gaulle, ready to shout, But there was no bloody battle. - By the way, I would like to show you something. - Show me what? - My etching. - Your etching? - Yes, well, I have only one. Come on. It was strange. It had been raining for a long time but this night, suddenly this night on the half of the moon, like a sea of light, like an explosion, you know what I mean? The town was lighted up with the moon and the night was filled with shouts and screams and you want to know? His name was Plato, my father, Plato and he was carrying me in his arms and he was running, well everybody was running, and the church was burning. Turkey soldiers had set fire to the church and the priests, oh god. I remember the priest. He was carrying the big silver cross from the church and they took him, put him against the wall in the moonlight, the long, white wall and they shot him. The Turks, the Turks. - And your father? - My father put me in a place where they could not find me and later in the morning, from the bridge, over the river, among alles, he was hanging. My father, Plato. God, I remember. My mother told me they wanted money, not to hang him, but there was no money. That was the day I decided the tomasis family would never want for money again. - He looks like a big, strong man. - Well actually, see, he may of been very small and really skinny. I don't know. Years later, when I was a young man in South America, I went to an artist and I told him what I thought, what I remembered here what my father looked like and as I remember my father. - Why did you want me to know him? - So you can know about me. - Why? - Because, Lizzie, I am sorry, Liz, is Lizzie okay? - Okay. - Because Lizzie, if ever I offend you, you can say to ourself, well what can you expect, he comes from a peasant, Greeks and Turks are small town and everything. He's common. - No, not common. And how could you offend me, Theo? - I will, Lizzie. I will. The mother goddess demeter. Isn't she beautiful? The lady of the golden sword, the glorious fruits. The lady of many mysterious and I love her so. - Of many mysteries. Is that why you love her? - Oh no. Then why? - Because she has great tits. Very, very important. Liz? - Here we are, senator. - Liz, I uh, I just got a call from the states. I'm sorry, we're gonna have to do it to you again. We have to leave. The national committee. There's been a decision. - Oh, I'm so glad. - Well, terrific news, huh, senator? - Terrific. Where's that damn car? We'll never make the plane. - Ah, the plane will wait. Everything will late from now on. - Come on, Liz. I haven't won the nomination yet. - You will, you'll win everything you want. You wouldn't settle for less. - No, no I guess I wouldn't. - Hey, Nico. Nico, come here please. - Yeah. Excuse us. - Hey. Yvette is a beautiful girl. I'm sorry to interrupt you. - It's okay. - Mr. Tomasis. - Yes? - Thank you for a lovely party. - Well. - I must be going now. - Thanks for coming. Thank you very much. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Nico, it goes, the thing with Selena? - It's done. - No? What, what. Come on, come on, say it. - Simonica called 10 minutes ago. I told him Angelo, I said, use power of attorney to sign the papers now. Do it. He did it. You own the tanker. - No, no, no. You, you own the tanker. You see, you see, Nico? - We use the funds. The contingency funds out of the ionian subsidiary and he agreed, he liked it. - How much? - Same as spyros, a little bit more but I didn't have to use the letter in the safe. - Well. You're as good as me. My god. Nico, today you did a wonderful thing. I mean, you bought a tanker. You're gonna build an empire. But Nico. Today you were lucky. Next time you go into deal, you go in with a loaded gun. Loaded. That's the way to deal. I mean that's, that's trade. That's commerce. Believe it, Nico. You believe it. The hell with it. Come on, let's go and get a drink. Today was a great day. George, some uzo. You know more than anything I want, more than anything in the world I want is for us to work together to get closer. Thank you. - Papa, how can you do it? - Do what? - How can you bring her here? - Who? - Matalas. - Well son. All right, I'm a Greek, like you. Nico, a man, a man has a right to his own life. I mean like you will have the right, do you understand? - No. - Nico. Nico. - Theo. What happened? - Nothing. Come on, let's go. Let's go. - Hey guys, here comes tomasis. Are you getting a divorce? - Come on, cut that out that. Get in, will you? - Where is your wife, Mr. Tomasis? Where's your wife? What's gonna happen in court? - He, he doesn't like me, does he? Nico. - No. - He's afraid that you'll see me. That we'll get married. - Married? I am married and you are married and like it is is the only way. - Son of a bitch. You are not going to use me this way. - What are you mad about? Come on, no marks. You wild cat. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Bastard. Let me go. - Oh, oh get up. Oh god, god. - It hurts? - Yes. - Don't lie. - It hurts, it hurts goddamn it. What the hell do you want? Oh god. Oh god. - You don't want to marry me? - Marry you? Oh gee, ah. - And finally, gentlemen, as laid down in section 19 of the United States merchant marine act, only American citizens are entitled to buy these surplus tankers. Now, Mr. Tomasis will be lending the corporate body the funds necessary for the purchase. Four million for each of the 20 tankers. The sum of 80 million dollars. - It's my privilege. Partners. Now, if you will join me in a cup of coffee after you've signed the agreements, a cup of coffee, that's all I can afford. - We're delighted. - Good to have you. - Thank you. Oh excuse me. Michael, they all seem like fine choices. All of them seem fine. - Good men all and true. Oh candy, would you mind helping those gentlemen, please? - Nice ass. - Theo, I've been meaning to talk to you. - Oh. - As long as you got some clout in the white house... - What, whoa, what clout? - Well you know James Cassidy. - Yeah, he spent a couple of hours on my boat before he was elected president. All of a sudden I've got clout in the white house? What? Hey, what's on your mind? - Well, if you happen to meet his brother when you visit there, a personal relationship with the new attorney general can't hurt, huh? - Michael, we've known each other for a long time. I mean, I mean you can level with me. You got problems? I mean, everything's above board, everything's completely legal. Isn't it? Hey, you worried about the boys? - I told you, they're all good men. No problems. - Don't worry me, Michael. - Give our regards to the president. - Always thinking, huh? Last night, Angela Howard sang at the white house. The guests included Neil diamond, who dropped in after giving his own concert at the Kennedy center, the Greek shipping magnate, Theo tomasis, was also there. As were Gregory and veronique peck. It seems that the president and Mrs. Cassidy are fusing together politics, show business, and big business as never before and these days, and nights, there's nothing dull about the social life of the white house. - Mister Attorney General. - Ah, Mr. Tomasis. - Mr. President. - Mrs. Cassidy. - Hello. - Thanks so much for coming. - Thank you. - You didn't meet my brother John. - Oh, Attorney General, how are you? - Tomasis. - Theodore tomasis. - Hello. - Well, time places. A child born in the white house is a very good thing, very good luck. My father used to say all the time. - I seem to remember you had quite a father. - Yes, I want to tell you both, the two of you, you ever get tired of president, I mean you need a rest, you come on my boat. We'll have a fine cruise. - Well, thank you. Please give our best regards to your beautiful family, would you? - Thank you. Nice to have seen you. Papa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 17 stitches on his ass and what does he think? If he hurt me. Goddamn kid, he's crazy in that fast little boat. I mean, he could of killed himself. I'm gonna tell you something. My son with stitches on his ass, no more boats, no more motorcycles, no more airplanes. You want to worry about Nico, you worry about Nico. Well I'm not gonna worry about Nico. - Theo, I want a divorce. - Simi, for the 100th time, no. - I can't live like this. - We're on mount Olympus, for Christ's sake. You live like a goddess. Everything. Like no other woman in the world. What woman in the world lives like you? - But I don't have your love. - Simi, I have loved you since you were 17 years old. 20 years. For Christ's sake, I've loved you for 20 years. - Theo. Theo. Theo, you don't love need me anymore. I gave you Nico. Got your island, your women, your boat. Matalas. Theo. Where the hell do I fit in? - Simi. Simi, you're Nico's mother. - Nico knows you. Please, Theo. Give me my divorce. - Simi, I... I love you. I do. - You really should think about it. A presidential pardon doesn't look well with labor. - Well, I don't know, Johnny. Maybe not with the rank and file. - Well that's possible but he can cause a lot of trouble. - You know, one of the best things you've done as Attorney General was putting him in jail. He was skimming that fund and you proved it. Yes. Oh Jesus. - I lost our son. I'm sorry. - Liz, don't. Don't blame yourself. There'll be another. Darling, there will be. - Yes. - I don't think it's such a great idea. I really don't. Tomasis has invited us for a change of scenery, a cruise. - Why not? His brother, spyros, just had Princess Margaret aboard his yacht. But I mean, how can you compare the two yachts? - I don't really like tomasis. The few times he's been here at the white house, he amuses, but I get the feeling it's because he wants to use you. Has he used you? - No he hasn't and he won't. - But he's working on it. - Thanks. - I really want to go. I think it would be good for me. - But there are so many things you can do here. The best therapy is to keep occupied. It hasn't been that long since the baby. - It's been almost a year, Nancy. That's long. - When are you thinking of going? - I don't know. Soon. - Well, calm seas, everybody. - See you two at dinner. Liz, it's a terrible idea. - Liz... - I don't want to discuss it anymore, James... - I know you don't, I do. Tomasis is a dangerous man. I don't want you involved with him. - Involved? - Tomasis manipulates. He dissembles and he's in deep trouble. Tankers and shadow corporations and something about collusion. Already, our state department as a whole dossier on him. - I'm going on a cruise, James. I'm not going to represent your state department. - Liz, you are the wife of the president of the United States. - Oh for god's sake, James, I know who I am. I really do need a change. - Liz, people watch everything we do and they read things into it. The whole world does that. I know I'm being a pain in the ass reminding you but that's what they do. - You have nothing to worry about and you know why? Because I am the wife of the president of the United States and you are a pain in the ass and I love you. Very much. - And I you. Just come back soon. - Welcome. Welcome. Welcome, Mrs. Cassidy. - Theo. - Let me introduce you. These very nice people will be sailing with us. Lord and lady Allison. - How do you do? - Great pleasure. - How do you do? - Jean Luc and his madam. - I think you know my wife. - Monte Carlo, you had good luck. - Oh, of course you know Angela. - Hello. - Hello. Oh at the white house, you sang. - Yes. - Lovely. - Thank you. - Jefferson navarro. - How do you do? - Paola scotti. - We have already met in camp. - Met, yes. - Phillip sherman. - How do you do? - And of course you know. - Marta, I know. - Madam naya. - It's my pleasure. - Hi. - She reads palms. All right, everybody, enough formality. Let's go and drink, huh? - Some people collect paintings, some people collect stamps. My father collects people. - The name of the suit is the demeter. Do you remember the demeter. The golden sword? The lady with the fantastic uh. Over there is korz. It's a lovely island but time has forgotten it. You know I believe this part of the world, the aegean, the islands, could change a person's life forever. I really believe that. Lizzie. Lizzie, don't you feel well? - I'm fine. I'm fine, really I am. - You know, the guests, they're very nice people. Hey, maybe, maybe it's the food. You like Greek food? - I hate Greek food. - Then to hell with Greek food. What do you like? Spanish, Italian, French, huh? - French. - Flow in from Maxine's everyday. No difficulty. Whatever it is, no problem. Whatever you want. You ask. Anything, okay? - Okay. - Okay. And the god Zeus said to his sister, hey you want to see the sun dance? Watch. And the sun did her, a little dance and she got a big kick out of it and while the sun was dancing, Zeus took his sister to a very, very high cloud and he screwed her. Do I offend you? - Well, if I didn't offend leto. - No, not leto. Hera, her jealous sister, hera, she sent the snake and the snake chased her all over the place util she found refuge, right here in the temple of Poseidon. Huh? Fantastic, huh? - It's beautiful. - Yes. Beautiful and therefore sad. - Why sad? - Sad because nothing beautiful ever remains. True? - I don't know. Dragos, my island, mine. I bring water in. There was no water. Three ships a day, and now 20,000 kilos of the finest olive oil in all of Greece. Oh and strawberries, mine. For protection against the world. - To come and go and come back to. I think I understand it. - Can you? - Yes. Theo. - Does she wave to you from that island over there? Is that how you know she's home? - What are you talking? - What are you talking? Your actress, matalas. She has her island, too, no? Sophia. All the world knows. - Well, she wanted an island. So I got a good price on an island. But it's uh very small island. Throw a plate. - No. - You're not eating, so throw a plate. - I'd like a steak. - No steak. They have. No steak. Maybe you like. - What's that? - Gala is milk, and it's sweet like cheese cake. Want to dance? - No. Thank you. - Tomasis dance good. - Yes. - Very good. - Yes! - Theo. - I have to go home. - What are you talking about? - Home to america. Fly me to Athens and I'll catch a plane to Washington in the morning. - They don't expect you for two weeks. - I know. - Lizzie, like no other person, you make me feel so alive. - I can't stay on these islands anymore. I must go home. I have to. Don't you see, Theo, I have to? - When will you come back? - Never. - Oh, Lizzie. Never. - Get down! Get down! - Come on. No! - Down, stay down, stay down! Stay down. - No! - The world grieves. - Sad day for all of us. - I convey in the name of my country, our extreme regret. - A great sadness. I bring you the condolences of my country. - If somehow there could be a way to share your sorrow... - There is no way. Thank you. - Is my country loss. - Rashid, well. - Well. His majesty seems to be interested in your fleet of tankers. - Good. - He has set down certain terms. Study them. If they're acceptable, let me know. - I will tell his majesty I'm sure there will be no problem and tell him that the arrangement is good for the future. - Oh there are others, you know... - Ah, but the others would exploit the resources of your great country oh and for your kindness, rashid, please accept this gift. Salam, rashid. Okay, you son of a bitch. What do you want, spyros? - This company, this corporation that you formed with the Americans. - Uh huh. - It's my understanding you are going to offer the 20 tankers to the Saudi king. You'll be cutting a lot of throats, Theo. The oil company, the transport company. - Yours. - And eventually, think the American government, my friend. After all, if the king of Saudi Arabia had his own ships, why could he pay to haul his own oil? Then maybe he will think, what does he need the oil company for at all? Then maybe he will think, who knows, who knows, what he will think, huh? Are you going to make the deal, Theo? Is it going to work? - If I want it to work, it will work. - Theo, I want to help you. - Why not? Why not, Theo? For the good of the family. - Spyros, since when did you give a shit about the family? Hey, is it true, are you going to, are you going to divorce your wife? - Of course. Who can deal with that? Sure. - That's a terrible thing to do. - Me? But simi's going to divorce you. - Simi will never divorce me. Never. - My spies... - I don't give a damn about your spies. Simi will never divorce me. Never. Come on, sit down. Tell me about this little proposition. - Okay. You have ships. I have ships. Instead of 20 ships, we go to the Saudi king with 35 ships. We go to him with fleets of ships. We could have an empire, Theo. The two of us, the two of us together. - Partners? - Partners. Brothers. - Spyros. - Huh? - Fuck you. - Mr. Tomasis. Mr. Tomasis. Mr. Tomasis. - Ah, simi, simi. Divorce. - It's about time, isn't it? - For adultery. - Of course. - Listen, Theodore tomasis didn't wantonly commit adultery on several occasions on the yacht, le belle Simone, and other places, with Paola scotti. - Paola scotti? - How did she dare? Everybody knows, everybody. I am the reason for the divorce. Not that Italian bitch. Not her. But me. - Simi has a sense of humor. It's very funny. Very funny. Not funny. How much longer? For Christ's sakes, it's been over a year. Lizzie, do something. Something for yourself. Come back to the world. Hey, I tell you what. You put on something special, something terrific and you go to a party. Why not? When? Listen, fuck him, too. I mean your brother-in-law Johnny, he runs for president and you have to isolate yourself? I mean what is it gonna cost him? The state of north Dakota? Oh, Lizzie. Lizzie, my god, it's good to hear you laugh. Hey, come on, Lizzie. We'll take a cruise. Dragos, maybe. You want to know something? Lizzie, I, I miss you. - Well how long are you gonna be in London? I'll call you in Paris. The Plaza? Goodbye. - Coffee? Coffee? - No, thank you. - Have you seen the papers this morning? - No. - Maxwell says John's early lead at the polls is only because he's jame's brother. - That's probably true, Nancy. He needs all our help. - Did you have a nice sleep? - Fine. - You look happy this morning. - I'm gonna go away, Johnny. - Well, that's wonderful. - I'm going to go to Greece. - Tomasis. - Yes. - Well, that would be a wrong thing to do, Liz. For whom? - For you, for all of us. For the family. - I'm thinking of seceding from the family. - Well, that's a sad thing to hear. - I'm tired, John. I'm tired of Cassidy politics. Of having to share my life with all of you. - Liz, to go off with that Greek. - And ruin the Cassidy image? - Yes and I believe it, Liz. If you hurt the family, you hurt the country. - And you'd rather I continue the deception? The anguish behind the veil? Liz Cassidy, the public shrine? Yes, I am a widow but the pains not that sharp. Not now. The dead are dead. I don't weep that easily anymore. I choose not to. - Madam, would you like something for lunch? - Yes, I would. I'm rather hungry. I'd like some moussaka. - Moussaka, yes. - And a small green salad with that goat's cheese. Feta? - And a dessert? - Could the chef make a galato? - Galaktoboureko? Of course he can. - Thank you. Steward. - Yes, ma'am. - Some wine, please. - Yes, ma'am. - Retsina. - Of course, ma'am. - Thank you. There were always so many people. So many people. Kings and comics and presidents. Well it demanded. What? A certain uniqueness? Let me tell you, Theo. I'm not unique. - Bullshit you're not unique. I am tomasis and you are with me, here and now and I would want no other woman in the world to be part of this time. So what does that make you? - Unique. Theo, come on in, it's wonderful. - Work. Fantastic. - Of course it's outrageous of you to leave me here 5,000 miles from home with only strangers to talk to. - Three days only. You can shop for three days. I'll fix those American sharks. I'll be back. Good morning. - Good morning, sir. - Call John and Nancy for me. : Cupid: J' draw back your bow j' j' and let your arrow go j' j' straight to my lover's heart j' j' for me j' j' for nobody but me j' : Cupid: J' please j' j' hear my cry j' j' and let j' j' your arrow fly j' j' straight j' - my son worries. Is that what he does all the time, worry? - No, not really. - Papa, eight ships impounded. They've taken eight of our ships. - So? - So the boran star goes into Norfolk tomorrow. They're gonna impound it, too. Papa, what the hell are we doing here? - Nico, come on. We're enjoying ourselves. - Come on, look. Tomorrow is Washington. Tomorrow is Michael Russel, Attorney General of the United States... - And he is my best friend. I'll fix it. Now, will you stop worrying? Look what a beautiful girl. Where do you find such beautiful girls? Come on, talk to her. - I don't want to talk to her, I want to talk you. You said we'd have a chat. - All right, come on, let's you and I dance. J'oh dance j' j' dancing the night away j' j' dancing j' j' oh dancing j' j' dancing the night away j' j' dancing j' j' oh dancing j' j' dancing the night away j' j' dancing j' good boy, huh? - Beautiful. - You like him, huh? - I adore him. - Mr. Tomasis. Mr. Tomasis. - What's going on? - I'm telling you to behave. - What's the matter? - Papa, they're FBI. - Afederal warrant, Mr. Tomasis. You're under arrest. - What, a joke? - Violation of the united states merchant marine act, section 19. Come along, Mr. Tomasis. - Hey, take your goddamn... - I told you behave. - I ought to break your ass now. Nico, you pay the check, huh? Handcuffed in a nightclub, for Christ's sakes. Then you drag me down here to Washington like some kind of goddamn common criminal. John Cassidy talked to you good, huh? - John's not in government anymore. He had nothing to do with it. It was my plate. You like some lunch? - Oh Michael, you're beautiful, beautiful. Attorney General of the united, does this son of a bitch have to be here? - He's fixing the light bulb. - Oh, does he have to be here? Can he fix it tomorrow? - They're all screened... - Tell him to get out, for Christ's sakes. - All right, come on. Come on, let's go, hurry up. - About time, Michael. What went wrong? You brought it all together when you were a New York lawyer. You told me everything was completely legal. - I was not your lawyer and the way things have turned out, your actions are contrary to the interests of the government of the United States... - Don't talk to me governments. Talk to me oil. I'll know what the hell you're talking about. - All right, my government feels that the Saudi's would not of agreed to their own merchant fleet, the fleet you supplied them, Theo, unless they were thinking about eventual expropriation of the oil companies. - Spyros. That son of a bitch brother of mine said the same thing to me. He put those words in your brain and he scared the shit out of you. Arresting me was a show of force to the arabs, wasn't it? - Now suppose they all got together and wanted to run their oil? Oh my god. -All right, all right. Michael, you and I are two old warriors. Tell me, what is the ransom going to be? - You're going to lose 20 ships. - Christ, 20 ships? - And a lot of money. And my guess is, Theo, it will take a miracle to keep you out of jail. - I thought coming home I thought how much I wanted to be coming home. This is the best arrival I've ever had. The best because of you, Lizzie. - I missed you. - Lizzie. Let's get married. What do you think? Marry me? - I don't think it's a very good idea, Theo. - Why not? Because I'm not a Cassidy? Lizzie, why not? Because I'm from a different universe? Because I'm a peasant? A pirating shark? Is that why, Lizzie? - No. - Lizzie, then tell me, why not? What is it? Because the widow Cassidy gets married again and it shocks the whole world and it bothers you? - Maybe. Yes. - But, Liz, this is a different kind of world where it doesn't matter. - It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't. - Because I'm old. Because I will die first and you will live a long time without me. - It makes very sad. - You know why? Oh Jesus, Liz. Liz, you, you love me, absolutely. I mean you said, desire and pity. That's, that's the whole essence of love. It's the essence. That's by an old Greek. - What old Greek? - Me. - Well, listen to me. To be married again. If I was to do it, to be controlled again, more than any man, it would be with you but I just don't want it. - Lizzie, Lizzie, what do you want? - To be allowed anything. I want to change my life. I want to start off again. I'd like to be permitted anything. I'd like to come and go and have no restrictions. I just want everything. - Lizzie. That's what I'm talking about. Everything. What do you want? And you laugh and you demand and you get. I mean, well you could shake your little ass and be rude, I don't know, stand on your head. Liz, there is no problem. I am tomasis. We'll put it all down in writing. What you must do, what I must do. How much for what. Under what circumstances. I mean, what happens if you run away. If I run away. All the possibilities. - It's horrible. - What? - Writing it all down. - No, it's Greek culture. A marriage contract is the way it should be. I mean, it's for your protection, Lizzie and it's right. For instance, now you don't want a baby, okay, no baby. We put it down. You want a separate bedroom. Okay, let's do one. Fine. You say you, you like to come and go. Am I gonna deny you that? But 10 nights a month together. Okay? I mean, at least. Huh? Lizzie. $50,000 a month, Lizzie, to piss away on hairdressers, tips, dresses, I don't want to know. Now you like to travel, another 1,000 a day. Expenses, charge accounts, unlimited. If the marriage is no good, either of us says to hell with the marriage. Okay. 10 million dollars for every year we stay together and if we're still married and I die, 100 million dollars. Welcome to my life. -And mine. - Reginald, never find a woman like that. - Son of a bitch. - Theo. Are you angry with me? - Darling, today I can't be angry. - You see, how could Theo be angry? It was for my sake, wasn't it? - What darling? - That you didn't invite me, that I would be hurt. - Oh no, I just thought maybe you would prefer... - But Theo, I am happy for you. Happy. - Thank you, thank you very much. - Have a wonderful marriage. - Thank you, simi. - Of course, be happy, Theo. Spyros. Excuse us, please. Why the hell did you bring her here? - I don't. She wanted to come here. - Wonderful party, Theo. Great happiness. - Thank you very much. Quite, I'm a very happy man. Don't say anymore. Shit, you're a shit. You've always been a shit and you'll always be a shit. - That's enough, simi. Enough. Come and lie down. - Oh fuck. - Nico! Hey, Nico. What's the matter, huh? Papas new wife. I mean, what, no kisses? I mean all evening long, you've been, you've been ignoring the most famous woman in the world. Hey, come on, you'll like her, huh. You say something. Lizzie. Lizzie, Nico, he wants to, he wants to say something. Go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead. - Hello, mother. - Nico. I hope we're gonna get on together. - Yeah and I hope you have a terrific time being a tomasis. Now if you'll excuse me. - I'm sorry. Smart ass kid. Hey, Nico. Nico, what the hell was that? Is that a kind word to talk to my wife? - You mean the most famous woman in the world? - No, I mean my wife. - Is that why you married her? 'Cause she's the most famous woman in the world? Jesus Christ, papa. - No, no, for honor and the respect and... - And bullshit. - You goddamn. - It's all right. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, son. I'm sorry about that. Oh Christ. Christ, on my wedding night. Son, all it takes is a little kindness. I mean, a little thinking of others. God, can't you try to be friends? She's a, she's a little girl. I mean, she's a woman. Son. She can bring such joy to our lives. I mean, please. Please, will you try to be friends, huh? - Okay, papa. Okay. - Okay, son. Okay, now. I'm sorry about that. - It's okay, it's okay. - Okay. What are you doing? - I'm going swimming. - Yeah. Yeah that's a good idea. You uh, you sober up, huh? - Yeah spyros, papa. He's supposed to be my friend, too. - What does spyros got to do with this? - She's gonna marry your brother, papa. Uncle spyros and mama. - That's a fucking lie. - No. - What? My, my beautiful simi with that hunk of shit? - To spite you, to hurt you and humiliate you like you did to her. - What did I do? I married a lady. - We're crazy. We're all crazy, we are. - Where are you going? - Hey! Anybody want to go swimming with me? - Sorry about that. Go dance. Lizzie, a miracle. You bring beauty to an angel. Lizzie. Oh, Lizzie. Bastards. I told them. God damn it, I told you no phones. I don't care. Oh, okay, okay. I'm sorry. - Matalas? - She wishes us well. - At midnight? - Well, she's sorry she couldn't come to the reception. - But where is she? - Oh, on her island. - And you said you'd see her tomorrow. - Sure, matalas wants to see me, there's no question, she's my friend. She's my best friend. Look at that, huh? Apple ass. Oh, Lizzie, Lizzie. Oh, Lizzie. - Theo. - Yes. - Why did you marry me? - What kind of question, huh? Come on, on our honeymoon night? - Why. - You, you. No other woman like you in the world. I mean, you make me feel fantastic. You make me feel more alive. I told you a million times. - What about love, Theo? - Well sure, I told you. - You mentioned it. - What's the matter? You got a Thorn up your ass? I mean what are we talking like kids? I mean, how many times have you mentioned it to me? - Not often. - Okay, I love you. Now you mentioned it, everything is wonderful. Come on, what are we walking? Now come on. This is a honeymoon night. Come on. Come on, get in there. Would you? Come on. Here we find all the questions and answers right here, I'm sorry. But the time to talk tomorrow. - Before you go or after you get back? - You want me to lie to you about matalas? Now, I won't do that. - Will you go to bed with her? - Oh god, it's possible, sure. Oh, Lizzie. - I'm not gonna sleep with you tonight, Theo. But it is your honeymoon night, you ought to screw somebody. Go screw a friend. Go to her. Go on, get out. - From my marriage bed? It's unthinkable. - Yes, well I've thought about it and it works out just fine. - Hey, Lizzie, come on, come on. You are my wife. - 10 nights a month. Isn't that the contract you wanted? And tonight is just not one of those nights. Now get out, Theo. - Bitch! - Mr. Tomasis, is there anything I can get you, sir? - Fuck off. - Theo, what a lovely wedding that was yesterday. - Yes, yes. Thank you so much for inviting us. - God damn crazy kid. He won first prize in Rome, you know. He's the best in Greece. Come on, Nico. Come on. - Quite a flyer. Yeah, with For a brain. - I don't know, Theo. That was quite a thing he did for you on the airline deal. - True. The airline deal was like genius. Then he goes and does a thing like that. - Coffee? - Crazy, that Nico. Anyhow, the vast majority of the world lives on planned economics. - Theo, people like us are in trouble. - He's right, Theo. Look what's happening in england. What's finally gonna happen there? - What the hell do you know? - I was expressing an opinion. - I'm talking to this gentlemen about something you know nothing about. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Liz!

Goddamn it now. - Bastard! - Come on, are you gonna behave? Are you gonna behave? Okay, okay, okay. Lizzie. Lizzie, please. Look, please, listen to me, will you, Lizzie? Such emotion. - Let go of my leg. I want my leg back. - Will you be nice? - Let go! - You promise to be nice? - Let go! - I'll let you go but you be nice. - I know what you are. You're a clown! And a bore. - And vulgar and common and an animal. You are fantastic. God. God, what a woman. - Oh bull shit, Theo. - What happened to the Cassidy's? Who was that woman who was just, just trying to kick me in the balls? Lizzie, come on. Come on, let's go and make love, huh? Please. - You're crazy. - Lizzie, look about what happened, I'm sorry and I promise, I promise it will never happen again and Lizzie, I love you. Lizzie, I... I love you. - Let go. - Hey. Come on.

You. - Well, but it is an art and I love you. - Oh, Theo. - Come on. - No. - Why not? - It's 10 o'clock in the morning. - Oh but I am an animal. - We have guests. - They're Greeks, they will know. They will finish their orange juice, then they'll go away. Oh you have a beautiful nose. Listen, on that contract, how many times a month am I allowed? - 10, animal. - Will you go for Thursday? Okay, spend a lot of money. - I could do that. Mrs. Tomasis, can I have a photo with your husband, please? Mr. Tomasis, can I have a photo with your wife, please? This way, please. Mr. Tomasis. How 'bout a nice one, please? That's nice. Thank you very much. - Mr. Tomasis. Yes? Yes, Philip. What about simi? Where is he? - In the study, Mr. Tomasis. - I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch. Like you, like you killed my simi. Like you, you killed her. - She killed herself. Get out of here. Get out of here. - I had her, so you had, you had to have her. - I loved her. - You son of a bitch, you love nothing, you bastard. What I do you try to be like me. Sine we were kids. I want to kill you, you son of a bitch. - It's not true. - She died because of you. - No, you. That, that. - Your whole life you tried to be. Your whole fucking life. Everything. You tried to be, you tried to be like me. Tell me why. Why? - Why. You do the same, Theo. Without me. To do something better than me. You will be shit. Because I'm better. Better. Better. - You're nothing, just old. Just old. - And. You, too, my brother. - And now simi is dead. - I loved her, too, Theo, believe me. But. I was not you. With simi. I was not you. - Linda. Very nice flight. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - I'll tell the boss about you, Madeline. Thank you. - Thank you. - Nico. Remember what... - I know, I know. My face is my sword. - That's right. - Okay, in there, let me carry the sword. - It's a deal. Michael, you happy? - You are a prick. - Such language. Gentlemen, shall we go in? - You figured it all out, didn't ya? - What? - The man who married the widow of our assassinated president, how could we put you in jail? - Michael, Michael. - Good morning, Mr. Tomasis. - Good morning, Mr. Tomasis. - Morning. - Morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. - Morning, sir. - Gentlemen. I think we can wrap this up in a very few minutes. Mr. Tomasis, Nico tomasis, his councilor and I have been meeting for the last few days and I think we've come up with a settlement we can all live with. Mr. Tomasis will return title to the government of all ships purchased from us. The balance of mortgage payment due, if any, will be canceled. There will be a fine levied of seven point five million dollars. - We had been talking in terms of a fine of three million per ship. 60 million dollars. - I'm afraid that work an impossible hardship on my father, sir. Along with council, Mr. Russel and I have had conversations about that. Mr. Russel. - Mr. Tomasis is currently negotiating with German interests to build tankers with something over two million dead weight tonnage? - Correct. - Mr. Tomasis has agreed to break off these negotiations and to bring his business here to the United States. Now, I don't have to tell you what a windfall that would be to our ship builders here. And I understand it, Mr. Tomasis is thinking of an immediate expenditure of a sizeable sum of money. - Quarter of a billion dollars. Money spent here, not overseas. And my father needs considerable monies to fund such an operation and I'm afraid that a fine of 60 million dollars or anything near that figure will knock the whole thing out of the box. - Seven point five, Mr. Tomasis, that's the figure you could handle? - Well, uh, a hardship but I'll have to find a way. - Satisfy you, gentlemen? - If you're satisfied, I'm satisfied. -I am. - Me, too. - Then that's it, then. I'll put the papers in work. Well gentlemen, that seems to conclude today's business. Thank you very much. Odds we'll see you at the office. - Bye, Mr. Tomasis. - Oh, goodbye. - Mr. Tomasis. - A pleasure. A pleasure, sir. Son of a bitch. Hey, you ever get tired of playing Attorney General, you come aboard, we'll take a fine cruise. Maybe up the dalmatian coast, huh? Oh and by the way, Michael, I want you to see dragos. It's fantastic now. - Thank you, I'd like that, Theo. - Good. - Congratulations. Nico. - Nico, today you were as good as your old man ever was. - Papa. - No, no, maybe, maybe better. You know something? Pretty soon you can take over the tomasis enterprises. - Me alone? - Absolutely. - And what about, what will you be doing? - Living, Nico. Living. - Please, Mr. Tomasis. - Well, he's sleeping. What is it? - Mrs. Tomasis, I must speak to him. - Theo, it's Philip. He wants to speak to you. - What the hell is so important. Sorry, I didn't want to be disturbed. Now, Philip, what the hell do you want, huh? Jesus Christ. What is it? What? - Nico. - Nico? What, what, where's Nico? No. No. - What's happened, Philip? - His airplane crashed. He's killed. - Oh my god. Theo. Oh my god. - No, god, no. - Oh, Theo. - No, god, no. - Theo. - Oh, god. No, god, no, no, no. - Oh, Theo. Theo. - Please god, no. No, god. Hey. Hey. What was that for? - 'Cause I wanted to. You can only grieve so much. - No, losing Nico. My son. Nico he was, so beautiful. - Yes, he was. - I'm so tired. - Will you see someone? Have some tests, please? Will you? - Sure. Hey. Hey. Me, too. - All right, nurse, thank you. No, no, leave them. - Yes, doctor. Good afternoon. - Nurse. I can never remember her name. - That is irena. - Ah, yes. She has a nice ass. - Has she? Do you know, I never noticed? - My friend, we're getting older. - I feel maybe we should both retire, huh? - What to? - To an easier life. Why not, Theo? You've got everything. - Explain to me. - I read yesterday that you won a medal, a gold medal, from nonivay. What was it? Industrial merit. - Bananas. Doctor, what? - Honor, money, everything. What else do you want, Theo? - More. Can you keep a secret, doctor? - Of course. - To be president of Greece. But a secret, okay? Now I have a question, but before the question, please, another look. Now, if was to become the president, I mean if I became the president of Greece, who would serve the longest? My vice president or me? - Unfortunately my friend, you have a very short time to live. I'm sorry. - For the reception. - Terrific. - Are you sure? I could try this one. Would you like to see it, Theo? - Yeah. - Help me. I want to look beautiful when you get the medal. You haven't told me yet. - About what? - About the doctor. What did he say? - Oh, that I will live to be 100 and he said... - Said what? - That I shouldn't be president of Greece. - Why did he say that? - I have everything. Who needs it? - Good. Do you like this one? - Fantastic. - For the prince's party. Can you see my entrance? I love it. Theo, do you mind if! Go to Paris first? - No. - You'll be alone here. - Only for awhile. We'll meet in Oslo. - Now, this one is for shopping. - Shopping, huh, very pretty. - Nancy will meet at the georges sanc, maybe John, too. Are you sure, Theo? - You go to Paris. Walk down the champs, you go to Maxine's, you buy things. Easy do it. Enjoy it. - Theo, I... - Do it. - I worry about you when I'm not with you. - Hey, let me see that dress. - Do you really like it? - Fantastic. Get me a boat. - Yes, sir. You want another piece of herring? Here. 120 years old. Here is lucky herring. My friend, I won't be president and you are pleased. Here. Have another piece of herring. For luck. What we need.
