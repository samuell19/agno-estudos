"Only part of us is sane: Only part of us loves pleasure and the longer day of happiness, wants to live to our 90s and die in peace, in a house that we built, that shall shelter those who come after us. The other half of us is nearly mad. It prefers the disagreeable to the agreeable, loves pain and wants to die in a catastrophe that will set life back to its beginning and leave nothing of our house save its blackened foundations." Véga! Véga! Alex! It has calved. Come, Véga. Forget it, it's dead. It never breathed. WITH THE WIND Good afternoon. Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. My name is. My name is. How are you? -How are you? -How are you? -Hello. -Hello. Ludmilla. I let them have a little run. No, not you! Go back to the car! Galina, are you coming? Galina Shevchenko. -You've both seen pictures. -Okay. Say hello to Mrs Favre. -Hello. -Hi. I'm Pauline. Good afternoon. My number is on the papers. We'll pick Galina up in 5 weeks. Children! Oleg! Petr? Go to the car, right now! How are you? Can I stay here? You have to go to Geneva! Shit! Come on, hurry up! Let's go, let's go! You have to take all of that? I take this in the morning, for iron and selenium. This is for Thyroid. And this is for headache. Yes, I know. But here... You'll see, you'll get better. Sorry. "God is great, God is good. Let us thank Him for our food. By his hands we all are fed. Thank you for our daily bread. Amen." -Wifi? -Ah, no. Not here, I'm afraid. Poor thing. What do you mean "poor thing"? I remember when you arrived here and realised you'd miss Roland-Garros. -Well... -You were so cute! -She'll think we're mad. -No. I'm telling you. She'll soon forget this Wifi nonsense. Hello? What's that? Is that them? Yeah, they're here! Yeah! They're here! Over there! Hi, it's over there! By the barn, on your right. Watch out! Oh, my God! Oh, no, no! It's going to be okay. Are you crazy? -What? -He was driving like a maniac! -I'm really sorry. -Alright. -I'll buy it. -What for? To eat. Asshole! -I'm Samuel, the engineer. -Hello. You know what? I'm taking it. Don't act like this is nothing. -Where are you going? -Where do you think? Where should the lorry go? Take the path at the back. The one we've mowed. There's blood in the lungs. There's nothing I can do. Sorry. Hush... it'll soon be over. -You okay? -I'm okay. I'm okay. -Aren't you going to introduce me? -Galina. This is my sister, Mara. Hello. She comes from Chernobyl. -Chernobyl? -Yeah. One of your projects? Yes. A charity sends children here for the summer. So she's staying with us. There's too much caesium in her body. She needs healthy food and fresh air. Being with us will keep her healthy for a year. And you believe that? You think they'd send them here for nothing? -I don't know. -Why would they? Okay, let's go. I could check if her levels go down. Test her urine. -Would you do that? -Yeah. You pee in here, give it to me and I'll test it. Okay? You need to pee. Here. Forget it. We'll do it when we get home. Can I see your cows? There's no need. Pauline, I have to come and check. Don't worry. Everything's fine. -We had a lovely calf, two days ago. -Really? Great! I hope it's worth it! Of course it is! We can cut down more trees for timber if need be. I'm sure it'll pay in the end. -And they kill our animals. -Stop it! I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose. He's cool, I promise you. Did he have to cut across? Couldn't he go around? Why did we bother to mow? He couldn't go around. And it was faster that way. It'll take a while to grow back. Relax. Fuck, they've flattened it all! Are you hungry? A bit. Here. It's very kind of you. I'm sorry, it's quite basic here. You must be used to better. I'm not used to anything, every site is different. I have to admit that yours is... special. What do you mean "special"? I've never installed just one turbine. Usually, it's at least ten. So what do you think? It's a project. Autonomy. What about you? What do you think? I think... It's windy here. So why not use it? -Good morning, ladies. -Good morning. Galina, can you pass the cups? There. There are eggs, if you like. Can I have some coffee? Yes. You pour it, Galina. -You too? -Thanks. -I'd love some. -That's great. You've got a grown up daughter? Oh, no. That's Galina. She's from Chernobyl, she's come here to get better. Do you miss your friends and family? My friends all went to a cool city with loads of cool stuff, and I'm stuck with cows! But it's pretty here, young lady. Why waste your entire holidays going to discos? You'll see different things here. But it's so dull here. What did she say? She loves it here. -Really? -What did you say? Good evening. We're almost done. -The base will be ready tomorrow. -Perfect. "Colouring, additives, stabilizers, glycerine..." See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Here. And you, Galina. That's it. -Here? -You too, Samuel. Come on! Yes, come on! Okay. Yes, that's it. You go there. Everyone ready? One, two, three. Wow, it's hot! Thank you. -To our wind turbine? -Yes. Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers. Capitalism destroys everything. Our relationship with animals and nature. Even human relationships. So we live differently. Yeah, but in a way, you've quit. -Of course not. -No. We're not quitting. It's about quality of life. There's no point. It's useless. I'd even say selfish. Selfish? Are you serious? Yeah, millions of people all around you enjoy their central heating and air-conditioned cars. That's the problem. Do you have something against our plan? Do you feel threatened? No, not at all. The plan is fine. This isn't about your plan, it's about... your life. It's a question of... pleasure. Where's the pleasure? I can see where you get yours. Taking part in the destruction the planet. Great! I just put a wind turbine in your garden! I'm not saying I have the answers. Yeah. We're your little alternative project. Whose side are you on? Tell me. I know what you want to hear. Yes, I've worked on big sites. In the Middle East and China. Basically, you don't give a shit. You'll work for Sheikhs and Commies. Why not? Both pay well. So you make lots of cash? What for? Do you have family? Kids? A project? No. Of course you don't. A cynic with children would be too weird. You idealists don't either. What? What did he say? -Alex, stop! -Wait... I want children. It's not a problem! Pauline... I'm not joining in your cockfight. That's too easy. When it comes to kids, you turn to the women. Fuck you! What are you doing? I'm sorry. Are you going to smoke it all just to show off? You behaved like a fool. Me? Yes, you. You too. Oh... great. No booze left. I'm going to bed. -And you? Are you coming? -Yeah. Can you go get him? So you have a car. It runs on sump oil. Oh, yeah? Of course. -Okay, you already gave us a lecture! -Me? -A lecture? -A proper one! I was a little drunk. So you didn't mean all that? I may not believe in your project but still admire you. And what about your life? You go all over the world? I travel all the time, yes. -Where do you live? -Nowhere. Between jobs, in hotels. -You've never wanted to settle down? -Never. It's a pity, we can't see. There's a big canyon that stretches quite far. It's beautiful. Like a big arena. So it's like Colorado. I don't know. I haven't been. Have you ever been abroad? No. Never. Pauline! Galina? Where are you? -Galina, don't move! -Galina! Stay where you are! -It's a cliff! -Galina! Samuel? Samuel, I can't see you! Where are you? Galina? Galina! Galina, answer me! -Pauline? -Yes! Stop it, I can't see you! Sorry. I can't do it all on my own. Good girl. Let me. Sorry for the mess. It's time. Alex is already there. Okay. -Okay, I'm ready. -Oh, no! What? What's wrong? I don't have any other dresses. I only have this one. Take this. No. I can't wear that. No way! No, Galina, you're only 16. Are you in love? Well... We've been together 15 years. It's complicated. It's simple. It's not that simple. I'm going to see the animals. Some wine, Galina? Sorry, too late. Thank you. Who's that guy on his own? Samuel, the engineer. Really? He's staring at you. Want me to introduce you? Samuel, come over here. -Galina, some pie? -Yes, please. I want you to meet my father... Hello. I'm Samuel. And Mara, my sister. -Hi. -Pauline told me about you. -You want pie? -Really? She never talked about you. Probably nothing to say. They kept you well hidden. -Staying in the village? -No, here. You are privileged! I'm only invited when there's a party! You're not welcome here? -Medicine isn't welcome. -Okay, everyone... I want to thank you all for being here. We've invited you all here today to launch the wind turbine. Our turbine that will allow us to produce clean electricity, naturally, and independently of the nuclear industry and all of their crap. -This turbine... -I'm sorry to leave. Don't be. Why? I wouldn't have come otherwise. -Come here, Pauline. -Then I'm happy. Pauline. Pauline, come see. She's feverish. -Shall we call Mara? -No. I'll put her in quarantine and give her herb soup for a few days. Hello. Put it there. Thank you. I have good news. Your levels are getting better. Pee. Super. Really? We knew they would. How's life at the farm? The animals are fine. Not the animals, Pauline. You. Are you okay? -Shall I come when Alex is away? -No, Alex is always there. Very good. Yes! Pauline? Pauline! What is it? Listen. -What? -Can you hear it? No. What? The wind turbine has stopped. It's sabotage! We're a threat! Look, the box is all smashed! You coming? Yeah. Can you fix it? I don't know. This goes here... Fuck! Have you fixed it? -No. -I'll switch on the meter. No! -Why not? -I'm not connecting to that shit! -You're kidding? -No, I'm serious. I'm not doing it. Hello? I'd like to speak to Samuel Nieves. Until when? Hello? Hello? Yes, we were cut off. We've got a major problem. He must come back. What? I can't hear you. Shit. Please, no! Come on! Come on! You'll be okay. That's it. Come on, push! It's coming. Come on. Come on, girl. That's it. Almost there. Yes! That's it, it's out, my darling! And it's beautiful! Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Stand up. Come on, boy. Come on! The soil has nothing left. It's poisoned. Everything's dying. It's useless. What? What we're doing is useless. Don't say that, Pauline. We can't do this alone. We can't fix everything. Maybe we're wrong. -I'll call Mara. -No. So she can pump them full of drugs? I didn't know it'd be so soon. Nor did I. -Shall we go? -Yes. Come on. This was sabotage. It's serious. Yeah. Hello. Good afternoon. Welcome back, Samuel. You didn't reconnect the meter? No! Cold water revives the mind. The problem is quite serious. I need a new part. I've ordered it. -They'll send it here. -How long? A few days. I'll give you three. Or you can take it all back. Changed your mind? -About being independent? -No. On the contrary. We can live without electricity. Yeah, and lots of other things. Only the lack of love makes life hard. I'll take my things up now. -I'll get some sheets. -Yeah. Samuel, I think it's best if you get a room in the village. You're right. It's better. I'm not going to preach, Pauline. I just have one question. Did I arrive at the right or the wrong time? The right time. You arrived at the right time. Then everything's fine. Good evening. Hi! Thanks for coming. This is the grass soup I gave her. At first, it worked, but now, it's not enough. I give mine natural additives. and copper. -It will be good for these too. -Okay. -Let's put the chains on them. -Yeah. The Romans used to do this. Who is that? He's a sorcerer. Maybe your hay isn't rich enough. Can I see it? How is it? You know what? I don't care. We won't quit. I'll plough all the fields! I broke the wind turbine. What? It was me. You would never do that. Destroy something we built together. Would you? You know what? I don't care. We'll forgive each other and pretend it never happened. Thank you. Here they are. Galina? We're only staying for 5 minutes. -Hello. -Hello. -Hi, I'm Mara. -Ludmilla. Galina! You've become so pretty! Thank you. You've done a great job. Let's go, kids! Farewell. Thank you. You'll come back? Safe journey. Where's the calf? I'm talking to you! -Where's the new-born calf? -In the shed. -Can I see it? -I'm not showing you my animals. It isn't your farm, Alex! Remember that. -This isn't the time, Mara! -No? Pauline, are you nuts? Look around you! Your cows wear necklaces. What sect are you in now? I want to see the calf. You can't see my animals! -Going to chop my head off? -Get lost! -It's my farm, Alex! -And mine. -Show me that calf! -No! What the hell are you hiding? Alex, that's enough! You too, get lost! -Alex, let go! -Let me go. Let me go, Alex. -She's coming with me. -Get off! I'm fine! Finish your work and get lost! -Let's go. -Get lost, all of you! Stay a bit longer. I can't. Haven't you ever thought of leaving? I've only thought about it. I'm leaving tomorrow to work far away from here. You could come too. Remember that place I took you to? Yes. I'd really love you to see it. It's beautiful when the fog has lifted. Stop! Nobody's allowed in! There's an epidemic. -You must go. -Sorry, Pauline. We had to intervene. Alex! Let me go! Let me go! Alex! Hush! They've killed all the animals... We fucked everything up! No. No, you were right. Pauline. Pauline, calm down. Nobody can prevent this virus. Okay? Not even with vaccines. I've done a lot of thinking. We'll start from scratch. But differently this time. We can start by growing wheat, like your parents did. Do you ever stop believing? Never. And I want goats too. Grey goats. And Mangalica pigs. I know what we have to do. I know you do, and you'll do it well. I'm giving you the farm, Alex. I'll talk to my father and Mara. I want it to be yours. To be in your name. Is this how you tell me you're leaving? With him? No. On my own. For a second, you thought I lacked courage. For a second, yes, I did. WITH THE WIND Subtitling TITRAFILM
