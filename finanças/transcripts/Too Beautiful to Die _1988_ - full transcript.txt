You were sensational. - Thank you, David. Alex. - [Alex] Yes? - I'd like to use Sylvia in that music video, "Blades." Think she might be free? We start next Monday. - I won't even check my calendar. You just say the word, okay? - Good. I'll be in touch as soon as I get back from London. You dog. - Ah, Sylvia. That's her. That's the girl I want. Set it up for me, Alex. - That's impossible. There's no way with this one. She's saving it for Mr. Right. - Don't play games with me, Alex. I don't like repeating myself. I want that girl. - Listen, what's the big deal? Girls like her are a dime a dozen. I can line you up with a hundred girls. - You're not listening. It's scum like you that are a dime a dozen. Do I make myself clear? Sunday night, I'm free. - Yes, all right. I'll do the best I can, but... - Look, I'm not asking you for a favor. I'm giving you an order. Or do I talk to the police? - Okay. Sunday night. (soft synth music) (keyboard clacking) (computer buzzing and whirring) (synth music cont.) (slow, searing guitar instrumental) (Sylvia gasps) - Sylvia. (Michelle laughs) - What's going on? - [Model] Go on, Sylvia. You'll enjoy it. - Ah, baby. - [Sylvia] Who is he? - Look, Sylvia, it's okay. - What's this? - Relax. He's a very important friend. - Where's Alex? - [Model] He's not going to hurt you. - What's going on? - Don't worry. Don't worry, baby. I'm not gonna hurt you. - He's here for you. - Don't touch me. - Come on, Sylvia. - Don't touch me! - I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. (models laughing) Baby, come on. - Let me go. - Let go. (tense, eerie music) (Sylvia screams) (tense, eerie music) (computer beeping) - [Sylvia] I hate you! I hate all of you! - [Model] Hey, where you going, Sylvie? - [Sylvia] You can rot in hell! - Hey, what's happened? - Damn you. - What's wrong, Sylvia? - Damn you. - Easy, girl. - Let me go. - Hey. - Don't touch me! - Ah, the hell with you. Hey, get outta my car. Sylvia, get out. Get out. Get out! Find yourself another agency, bitch! If anybody'll take you. You're finished in this town! (object clatters) (bicyclist thuds) (Sylvia gasps) - Hey, you blind? Are you all right, miss? (Sylvia whimpers) Hey! Hey, where you going? You gotta be crazy! Jeez. - David. Hi, how you doing? - Hi, Alex. - Jesus, what's that monstrosity? - Monstrosity? - Yeah. - It's a work of art. The video title is "Blades," right? - Yeah, right. - Hmm. Well, this is what props came up with. - [Alex] Great. - Yeah. Have you ever seen more beautiful blades in your life? Hm? - Fantastic. - Are the girls in makeup? - Yeah, they're almost ready. But, uh... - What's the problem, Alex? - Sylvia isn't here. - What do you mean? Another engagement? Alex, you promised. - Oh no, no. It's nothing like that. - Oh. - She's disappeared. - What do you mean, disappeared? - Well, I can't reach her, and, uh, look, can't you start without her? - Well, I guess I'll have to, although I don't see how it can work. I was counting on Sylvia.

Tag number is, wait... Milan 0-A-6-6-6-1. - Yes, I do. What's happened? Last night I lent it to a friend. - Really? I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you. Last night, your car went into a ditch and the gas tank exploded. Well, we found the charred remains of a body in the wreck. - Oh, my god. Poor Sylvia. - What was her name? - Sylvia O'Neal. She was a model with my agency. - Hm. And, how come she was driving your car? - Well, there'd been a little dinner party at my house. Seems Sylvia had one too many, and I remember that suddenly, she got very angry. I don't know about what. She just took my car and left. - And about what time was this? - I'd say it was around 1:00, 1:30 at the latest. - That's strange. - Why's that? - Well, the accident took place not more than 10 kilometers from your house, except that it happened just after four. A truck driver saw the explosion. So, your friend took three hours to drive 10 kilometers, but she had to be going like a bat out of hell to jump the guardrail. Now, doesn't that sound strange to you? - Maybe she was just on her way back to return the car. - Ah, maybe that's it, yeah. But we still don't know where she was during those three hours. Now, who else was at your dinner party? - Well, there were three other women, models who work for me. - Huh. No men? - No. It was a working dinner, you know. - Ah, a working dinner. Well, would you mind giving them a call? You've all gotta come down to the morgue. - To identify the body? - Personal effects. I'm afraid there's not much else to identify. It's just a formality, you understand? - Sure, lieutenant. The girls are kinda busy now, but I think they'll be wrapping up soon.

Tomorrow's another day. Thanks everybody. - Bye. - Bye. - [Model] See you tomorrow. - Careful. Those are real. - Yeah, I know. They're nicely balanced, too. I thought I knew quite a lot about weapons, but I've never seen anything like these before. Where did they come from? - Oh, they come from the fevered brain of a weird guy in New York. The set's practically one of a kind. - How did you enjoy the party at Alex's last night? - Party? I wasn't there. I flew in from London on the late flight last night. - Huh. - Why, did I miss anything? - Oh, I wouldn't know. But a girl who was at the party died later in an automobile accident. Her name was Sylvia O'Neal. Did you know her? - Sure. Sure, I've used her as a model in a couple of commercials. Well, you get to know everybody in this business. I'm real sorry. Hm. - David, we're ready to run that test. - Um, will you excuse me? - Sure, go ahead. - [David] Hey, George. Take five, huh? I wanna line up this next shot myself. - Girls. - Hi, Alex. - I'm afraid I've got some bad news about Sylvia.

Have a seat. - Tape on, Dave? - Sure. - [Alex] You gotta forget her and just get on with it. - I know Alex, but that girl had something special.

Any developments? - We've been running some computer tests on the image we elaborated from the charred skull we found in your car. There was a bullet hole in the right temple. .22 caliber. - In the temple? You mean she killed herself? - Well, you could call it the classic suicide mode. Except for one problem. We didn't find a gun in your car. No, she was probably murdered. The mechanics of the crash don't add up to suicide. There were no skid marks where the car went off the road. It makes sense only if the car was pushed off the road with the body inside. - What? I can't believe that. - Better get used to it, miss. But uh, let's go back to the unusual little party, with no male guests. - I already explained, it was a working dinner, not a party. I seem to recall that Sylvia got mad because she thought Michelle here was stealing jobs from her. Isn't that right, Michelle? - Right. She was always so insecure and she'd had too much to drink. - Uh-huh. And uh, what did you do after Sylvia left? Why don't you tell me? - I don't remember. I think we talked for a while, and... - And then we went to bed. - Exactly. All of us slept over at Alex's house. I couldn't take them home, Sylvia had the car. And there weren't any cabs at that hour. - Perfect. That way you each have three witnesses for your whereabouts that night. Four airtight alibis. - [Model] What are you saying? - What's this about alibis? - (chuckles) You'll need it, Mr. Conti. And lucky for you, you've got a much better one than the one you just furnished. A private security guard was almost run over by your friend as she drove out of your villa, alone, at one in the morning. But the fact remains, what did she do between one and four in the morning? (low, droning music) - [Leslie] Stop kidding yourself. You know it as well as I do, it was one of us, one of you. You shut her up. (Leslie crying) - Leslie, what do you say?

Let me get him some milk. (kitten whines) (ominous music) ("Warriors of the Wasteland" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood) - Fabulous. Perfect. Now open it up. You want her to suffocate? Go on. (intense music) Shut off the water! - [Model] Ah, Leslie! (tense music) (tense orchestral music) (spike clinks) (spike clinks) - Genius. Look at this. One of the rubber spikes was taken out and a steel one was put in its place. This is what pierced the girl's neck. - That's crazy. I set it up myself yesterday. All the spikes were fake. - Well, it doesn't take much to make the switch. Anybody could have done it. - Not really anybody. - Why not? - People can't just walk into these studios. If Leslie was murdered, it must've been somebody the studio guards knew. - What about at night? The place is locked, isn't it? - But the keys are in the office. - And uh, is there always a guard in the office? - Yes, pretty much. - Huh. Is security any good? We'll check it out. Uh, by the way, nobody goes out without my permission. Gentlemen. (phone buzzes) - [Model] Hello? Yes, just a moment. Mr. Conti, you're wanted on the telephone. - Not now. - [Model] He says he's a client and that it's urgent. - Okay. You'll have to switch the call to the dressing rooms. - [Model] Just a moment please. (phone keys clicking) (telephone rings) - Yes? Yes. - [Achitze] This is Achitze. I've seen the papers. You trying to frame me? - Of course not. I should ask you the same thing. You have more to lose than I do, you know. - Ha, a smart ass like you just might get the idea that I could be blackmailed. Is that your game? - Well, if it's a game, I'm not dealing the cards, that's for sure. - [Achitze] What do you mean? - Somebody just killed Leslie. - Oh, my god. - Look, we can't stay on the phone. There are police all over the place. We've got to talk. Is my place okay? - No way. Your place is bugged with hidden mics and cameras. Meet me at my place, tonight, and no monkey business. - All right, all right. I'll be by after one. - All right. I'll be expecting you. (low, droning music) - It's not easy to come back here.

It locks by itself. - Oh, thanks a million. - Turn out the lights when you go. - Okay. (dramatic orchestral music) (telephone buzzes) - [Alex] Hello? - Alex, have you seen the paper? That guy's been killed. - Yes. I was supposed to see him last night. I went by his house, and I rang, and rang, but nobody answered. He must have already been dead. - Oh, my god. - Listen. I don't think the police can tie this murder up to the others, but just in case they should start asking questions, you don't know anything. Got it? Especially about my parties. - You fool.

All the major fashion designers were represented in a dazzling of new looks. - Goodbye, miss. - Bye. - On hand to watch the show were many TV and movie celebrities, and the wives of several prominent political figures. Elsewhere in the province, continuing flooding in the Po Valley has caused considerable damage to farms in the area. Getting back to fashion, a report from police headquarters suggests there might be a fashion model murderer roaming the streets of Milan.

What can you tell us, Jack? (phone buzzing) (phone ringing) - Yeah? - Alex? Alex, it's Lauren. Michelle's dead. - I know. I saw it on TV. - Alex, they got her, too. Just like Sylvia and just like Leslie. Alex, who is it? I don't understand. What do they want from us? Do you realize that we're the only two left from that night? Who's gonna be next, you or me? - Calm down. - Or did you do it? It's just me left. It was you, wasn't it? Sure, that was you following me in the park this morning. You wanna kill me, too. - Shut up! Get a grip on yourself! - I can't stand this anymore, Alex. Let's just go with the police, please. We'll tell them everything. They'll protect us. - Oh, yeah? Well, what they'll do is just lock us up for prostitution, drugs, and tax evasion. - Stop thinking about yourself all the time. Alex, I can't stand this, please. I'd rather go to jail than die. - Don't lose your head, Lauren. We're not dead yet. We may even be able to make some moves of our own. - What kind of moves are you talking about this time? You and your brilliant moves, that's what got us into this to begin with. - I've got an idea, but I need to check some information in the office. And to do that, I've got to shake the cops that the police lieutenant's put on my tail. So, you just relax, sit tight, and wait for me to call. - Alex, I'll go nuts if you don't call me as soon as you find out something. - And don't open the door for anybody, especially if it's somebody you know. - You bastard! (Lauren grunts) (phone clangs) (slow, suspenseful orchestral music) - Oh. - Excuse me, I'm looking for the coffin of a girl who died in an accident. You know, the girl who burned in that car? - Oh, sure. I know who you mean. They put her down there. See? Until the family decides what to do with the remains. Second row on the left. Top tier. - Thank you. (slow, tense music) Pardon me, sir? These flowers were on the coffin. Somebody must have just brought them. See, they're still wet. You didn't happen to see who it was? - No, I didn't see anybody. No. (slow, tense music) (footsteps clicking) (low, suspenseful drone) (clock ticking) (door slams shut) (gate squeaks) - There he is.

(moody soft rock) He just went into a coffee shop. (moody soft rock cont.) - I'm gonna check it out. Shit, he got away. - Oh, no. Back door. (phone beeps) - What's happening? - [Officer In Car] We lost him, lieutenant. He slipped out the back door of the coffee shop. - That's just great, shit brains. (Brandam sighs) But, uh, every cloud has a silver lining. If he figured out he was being followed, he must have a guilty conscience. Guy's got something to hide. Go back to his house and wait for him. - [Officer in Car] You got it, lieutenant. (phone rings) - Hello? Hello? Who is this, goddammit? - [Sylvia] Hi, there and ciao. Hi, there and ciao. - Sylvia? - [Sylvia] Hi, there and ciao. - Sylvia? - [Sylvia] Hi, there and ciao. (phone clangs) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) - Car 6-3-2. The girl has just left her house. - [Brandam] Don't lose her. - Roger. (intense music) Let's go. (tires screech) (tense music) - Watch out! She knows how to drive. (tense music) - Car 6-3-2 here, the girl's off like a shot. We're in heavy traffic. We may have to use the siren to keep up with her. - Don't be an idiot. We gotta bank on the chance she doesn't know who you are. She might be leading us straight to her pal, Conti. (tense, suspenseful music) (computer keys click) - Christ. That's not possible. (phone keys clicking) (phone rings) (phone screeches) - [Man on Answering Machine] 9-6-6... - Oh, shit. - [Man on Answering Machine] Please leave your name and number after the tone. - This is Alex.

(soft orchestral music) (door alarm beeps) (haunting choral music) - David, I need you. Please. - What's the matter? Sorry, I don't think it's a good idea. - No. I don't wanna start anything. I just need a friend. I could use a friend, please. - Oh. Sure. Sorry, come in. (tense music) - Well, I'll be more specific after the autopsy, but at first glance, I'd say that the murder weapon was the same one as the one used on the girl. - Yeah. A knife with several blades they're using as a prop in a music video. It was stolen from the set a couple of days ago. Now, was this turned around during the struggle? - Yeah, it looks like it. Odd it wasn't knocked over. - Well, what you're saying is, it wasn't accidental? - It's just possible that the victim turned it so that the light would be powerful enough to blind his assailant. (camera shutter clicks) - Uh, excuse me a second. I'm not an expert in photography, but this camera should be synchronized with the flash, right? - Yes, of course. - Do me a favor. Develop this roll with the rest of your film. - Will do, sure. - Get it done as fast as you can, and no red tape, all right? - Okay, sir. (refrigerator door thuds shut) - Thanks. So, now you know the whole story, you know everything. - Yeah. (Lauren crying) Poor Sylvia. I never dreamed... - What? The kind of slime you're rubbing shoulders with, you mean? I know, you're so honest and so straight. Look, I'm not trying to justify myself for what happened that night. I mean, I'm no better than the rest. Or, I wasn't any better than the rest, I should say. Because now I'm the only one that's left alive from that night. For how long, David? David, please, I'm so scared. You have to help me. I don't wanna die. - Now, calm down. You're safe here. Who knows you're here? - The police might. They've been following me. Hoping that the killer would try to get me, I suppose. - You're probably right. You suspect anyone? - No. I've been thinking about it. It's like, somebody wanted revenge for what we did to Sylvia that night. But I don't understand, because she was the first victim. It doesn't make any sense. (telephone rings) - Well. (telephone rings) Hello? Oh, hi. How are ya? Fine. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah, fine. Yes. I'll be there. - New girlfriend? (David sighs) - Well, we have to be in London tomorrow for a commercial. I hope to get it done in 24 hours. You know what? Stay here and make yourself at home. Just relax. Okay? Nobody knows you're here. (knocking at door) - Come in. Well, have you got that safe open? Or do I have to go to jail for a real specialist? - No, no, no, we got it open. We found stocks, jewelry, some cash, a little cocaine, and these. - Oh, not just ordinary file cards, huh? This is the girl we found dead in Conti's car. Who's this one? - I've requested information on her. She's been in Milan just a short time. In fact, she's in London today, on a job. - That's interesting. - [Officer] What? - They come from the same town in the United States, Poughkeepsie. Talk about coincidence. (phone keys clicking) DeSantis? Brandam. Yeah. Want a tie-in to the data bank in New York. Yeah, sure, I've got the code. Yeah, that's the one. Perfect. Yeah, patch it through to my desk. (plane engine roars) (wheels skidding) - You sure you don't wanna come up for a moment? - Yeah, I'm sure. I've gotta take this straight over to the lab. You know me, I won't be able to sleep until I know it's okay. - Sleep wasn't exactly what I had in mind. (David chuckles) Will I see you tomorrow? - I'll call you, okay? Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh, my keys. - Oh. (keys jingle) It's a good thing you remembered. - Yeah. - Night. - Bye. (slow, tense music) - Hey! Hi Melanie, how you doin'? Johnny's taking me to a new club tonight. You wanna come with us? - Thanks anyway, but I'm just dead. - [Johnny] Sweet dreams, darling. - Oh, for Christ's sake, I can't get in. These are David's keys. - Well, sleep at my place. - Oh, no thanks. But do you think you could give me a ride to a cab? I'd like to get my keys back. - Sure. Come on. - [Melanie] Thanks. - [Girl] No problem. (tense music) (man on TV grunting) (telephone rings) - Yeah? - [Man on Phone] Ready with the hookup, lieutenant. - Oh, thank you. (tense music) - Shit, there's gotta be a goddam cigarette around here somewhere. (tense music) Hey. This is Melanie's. (scoffs) Incredible. What a bitch. Didn't take her long, that's for sure. (tense music) Melanie O'Neal? I thought her name was Roberts. (computer beeping) - Incorrect? Let's check it out. - Sylvia? "Wow! I made it. I'm going to model for Armani in Milan. And I'm in love. Come quick. I can't wait to tell you all about it. Much love, Sylvia. P.S. Kiss daddy for me. Does he still say that nice girls don't model?" My god. (computer keys click) (tense music) - Melanie O'Neal? Sylvia O'Neal. (Brandam sighs) Get a car ready. (telephone rings) - [David] Lauren? Lauren, it's me, David. - Oh god, David, thank god. Where are you? - [David] I'm stuck out here at the lab. I'm waiting the night crew to come on. - Is Melanie with you? - [David] No. Why? - Listen, her name is not Roberts, it's O'Neal. - [David] Yeah, so? - David, O'Neal. Are you dense? That was Sylvia's name. She's her sister. - [David] Sylvia's sister? Are you putting me on? - David, I'm positive. I found a picture of Sylvia with a letter to Melanie on the back. She even mentions their father. - [David] Well, that explains who put the flowers on the coffin, but it's weird she didn't say anything. Why the phony name? - There can only be one reason, David. She's here to... she's here to avenge Sylvia. David? (door clicks open) (tense music) (door clicks shut) (suspenseful music) (doorbell buzzes) (foreboding music) (woman laughs) - Hold it. (woman screams) - Easy, easy. We're the police, sorry. We're looking for Melanie Roberts. - Well, Melanie's out. She's at a friend's house. Um, David, he's a director. They got keys mixed up or something. Why? What happened? - How could we be so stupid? - Sir, the photo lab just sent it over, the picture that was taken when Alex Conti was killed. - Are you absolutely certain that's when it was taken? - I wouldn't be here if I weren't. This is the first time I've ever seen a killer about to strike. - I bet it is. A model. But who is she? - [Officer] Maybe that director could tell us who it is. - [Melanie] Hey, who's there? Open up! Open up, come on! - Not on your life. You can't kill anybody now. - [Melanie] Lauren, is that you? What are you talking about? - Shut up. I know who you are. I know you're Sylvia's sister, Melanie O'Neal. - [Melanie] Yes, I don't know how you found out, but it's true. But, listen, just let me explain. Before she died, Sylvia called me. She was desperate. She had to talk to me. I never believed in that automobile accident story, that's why I came here. I wanted to find out what really happened to her. Who her friends were. Let me out, Lauren. I can explain everything. - Sure, I let you out and you kill me too. You just wait. I bet you've got that knife in there right now. Don't ya, honey? David'll be here any minute. We'll call the police and they'll let you out. Okay? (fist pounds) (eerie music) (phone receiver clicks) (eerie music) (Lauren cries out) (lamp clatters) (eerie music) (glass shatters) No! No! (Lauren grunting) (Lauren cries out) No. (gasps) (plastic crunching) (eerie music) (Lauren panting) (low, ominous music) (Lauren breathing heavily) (Lauren gasping) (intense orchestral music) (Lauren gasping) (tense, suspenseful music) - [Man] Lauren! (Lauren cries out) (tense music) (Lauren yelling) (Lauren screaming) (Lauren panting) (slow, tense music) (Lauren crying) - No. David, no. No. (Lauren crying) No, no. No, David, please. No, no, David. David, don't. David, why? Why all the killing? You hardly even knew Sylvia. - That's what you all thought. I knew Sylvia like no one else. She could be whatever I wanted. She could be a woman. She could be a child. She could be... a whore. Even a robot. She was my creation. She was my invention. I could film her a million times, and a million times, she'd be different from everyone. Not a sleek, empty shell like the rest of you. - I didn't know. - No one was supposed to know. Sylvia was going straight to the top to be number one. The rest of you were nothing. I had a project for her. She was to be my masterpiece. - You're so insane. - No, I'm not insane. I'm a god. I'm a god who has the power of life and death over his creatures. (David chuckles) Sylvia was the best. Then she changed. She got tense. She said she felt like she was living in a video clip. She said reality was something else. She said she didn't need me anymore. Understand? And I created her. I didn't see her after the commercial until that night. I got back from London early and found her at home. She was in a daze and it's your fault. She was in shock after your sleazy party. (Lauren whimpering) She told me everything. Then I realized she'd never be the way she was again. I'd lost her. You dragged her down to your level and it destroyed her. Yes, Sylvia had already died once that night. (gunshot blasts) - You... you killed her, too? - So? She didn't know it, she didn't feel anything. She was dead inside. Putting her in the car and the rest of it was just a formality. You'd already killed her. - Sick. Sick. So, so sick. (Lauren crying out) - It hurts, doesn't it? - No! No! - But I really didn't care how much it hurt the others. And I really don't care how much I hurt you. (Lauren yelling) (eerie music) (pipe hissing) (eerie music) - David. David, please. David. David, please. - No. - Please. - You're dead. You're dead! - No! (gunshot blasts) (somber music) (slow, somber saxophone music) ("Perfect World" by Huey Lewis & The News plays) ♪ Everybody's looking for the perfect world ♪ ♪ Where you can have everything your heart desires ♪ ♪ The perfect boy will meet the perfect girl ♪ ♪ And the perfect love will set the world on fire ♪ ♪ Well what you gonna do, when one and one makes three ♪ ♪ And a vision of the future is impossible to see ♪ ♪ Nobody's perfect, not even a perfect fool ♪ ♪ If you'll have faith in me ♪ ♪ I'll keep faith with you ♪ ♪ Ain't no livin' in a perfect world ♪ ♪ There ain't no perfect world anyway ♪ ♪ Ain't no livin' in a perfect world ♪ ♪ But we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world ♪ ♪ Keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world ♪ ♪ Everybody's got secrets, now you know that it's true ♪ ♪ They talk about me and they'll talk about you ♪ ♪ Something happens to the pledges of trust ♪ ♪ Down through the years they begin to rust ♪ ♪ Now here we are, amid the tears and the laughter ♪ ♪ Still waiting for our happily ever after ♪ ♪ We'll keep on dreamin' as long as we can ♪ ♪ Try to remember and you'll understand ♪ ♪ Ain't no livin' in a perfect world ♪ ♪ There ain't no perfect world anyway ♪ ♪ Ain't no livin' in a perfect world ♪ ♪ But we'll keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa could we now ♪ ♪ Keep on dreamin' of livin' in a perfect world ♪ ♪ Yeah, we better keep believin' ♪ ♪ Ain't no livin' ♪
