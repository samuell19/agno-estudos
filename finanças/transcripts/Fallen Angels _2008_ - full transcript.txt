Are we still partners? We've been business partners for nearly three years. This is the first time we've ever sat together. We hardly ever see each other. l know how hard it is for a man to control his passion. Partners shouldn't get emotionally involved with each other. Fallen Angels Paging 3662. l'd like to leave a message. l'll meet his friends tomorrow. Where and when? Most people work from 9 to 5. l'm the opposite. My job is simple. l visit friends now and again. l don't know any ofthese people. They don't interest me, either. Soon, they'll be history. - Going out? - Yes. One's profession is very often determined by one's personality. l love my job... no decision making. Like who's to die, where and when - is all planned by others. l'm a lazy person. l like others to arrange things for me. That's why l need a partner. Ming? Ming lt is Ming, isn't it? Remember me? l'm Hoi. Remember? We were in the same class at junior high Yes... What a coincidence lf my Merc hadn't broken down. we wouldn't have met Everyone has a past. Even an assassin once had classmates at junior high. Whenever l bump into old pals... ...they always ask the same old questions. What do you do for a living? Got a card? We must keep in touch Let's arrange something. What d'you think? As long as there's money to make... You run your own business? Are you married? Don't tell me you're still single? Hey A son He looks exactly like you You're telling me... Your wife's a nigger, eh? You're very liberal. Blacks... They're beautiful. Colour doesn't matter, does it? You really look like a couple. Say, are you insured? Think about it. l'm a pro. insurance is my business. You know, l've been crowned 'King ofthe Brokers... ...in Southeast Asia. TlME are doing an interview with me in the next few days. Look, for old time's sake... ...l'll work out a decent plan for you. You may not want to hear this... ...but accidents happen, your family needs protection. Your job involves travel. You must think ofyour family unit. Would an insurance company... ...underwrite a professional killer, l wonder? l'd love to take up his offer... but who do l name as beneficiary? Remember the big bosom? The one we both fancied? We're getting married next week. Here's an invitation card. Just fill in you name, okay? Please come, and l'll have the insurance ready for you. Bring your wife along, too. See you Ages ago l paid a black woman $30 to pose with me for a photo. Whenever people asked l'd say she's my wife. And the kid in the picture? l think l bought him an ice cream. l always wanted to go to a wedding reception. But l know it's not my scene. Sifting through a man's rubbish... ...one can easily find clues as to his background. He visits this bar a lot. Likes the laid-back atmosphere. l always sit at the same table he sat at. Makes me feel sort of closer to him. There are some people you can never get close to. Get too close, and you'll find him boring. l'm someone who plays by the rules. l know how to be easygoing. No, he hasn't come home. - You're telling the truth? - Why should l lie? You live here? Of course. - Ever seen this person? - No. Keep out of sight. The cops are still outside. Where is your son? We rub shoulders with people every day. Strangers who may even become friends or confidants. One thing l do know-these cops will never be my friends. My name's He Qiwu. My prison number was 223. l haven't seen him for days. l'll inform you when he returns. l saw him come in. l want the truth That's enough Keep still l'm a very happy man. l was very talkative when l was small. But since eating an out of date can of pineapple when l was five... ...l lost my voice. For this reason. l have very few friends. l also found it diffiicult to find a job. So l finally decided to be my own boss. Having no capital, my only option... ...was to enter shops after hours and run my business that way. l don't mean to take advantage, but it's practical... to run an all-night business. Customers do come in at 3 a.m. to buy meat. Business is business. Always satisfy the needs ofyour customer. As the old saying goes: 'The customer is always right'. And as the boss, l must be kind, caring and tolerant. One can't afford to be selfish... ...there's no such thing as a free lunch in this world. l always work very hard at night - well, until very late. l don't make a fortune, but l'm happy. Are you crazy? Why are you making me wash my clothes? l'm a beggar The last thing l need is a laundry Leave me alone... You are crazy Get your hands off my clothes Sod off l'll smash you to pulp Okay, l'll pay you... if it's money you want Cretin Leave it l don't want an aubergine No, l don't want them l must act like a lady. l don't accept freebies from strangers. People will talk l'll have a melon, okay? Here What the hell You crazy or something? Stop that Listen, l washed my hair yesterday... Ouch Take it easy... Don't scratch l just want a late snack. l don't need a shampoo Okay, you win. Do what you like No l don't want a shave Don't touch me... Listen, l know l'm diffiicult, but l know some... ...who aren't Please don't shave me... l don't want a shave... l'll pay you not to, okay? Thanks. A double cone, please. Fuck lt's you l'm sorry... sorry... Stop pulling my hair, okay? l'll serve myself. l'll do it. Hi, it's me. What are you doing? Go to bed, don't wait up. l'm having some ice-cream. l hope l can come home soon. l don't know how much more l'll have to eat. Of course l'll have to pay Look, l've run into this guy, and... What's to explain? lt's the truth Come down and see for yourself. Hey Oh, no way l can't eat that lt'll burn my moustache. This is beyond a joke... What the hell's going on? l said come by yourself. l didn't say bring dad and the kids Too much ice cream's bad for dad. What if something happens? And the kids have school tomorrow. What's that...? l don't want to die from eating too much ice cream. Look, l'm being serious. l'll pay you, okay? Tell me how much, and l'll buy all the ice cream. Go on. My ice cream maybe a bit more expensive... ...but l think this family's having a great time tonight. l love ice cream. When l was a kid... ...an ice cream van always stopped outside our place. Every time l saw it. l was happy. l even asked my dad why he didn't drive an ice cream van. He didn't answer me. l later found out... ...that my mum was killed by an ice cream van. l was born in Taiwan... ...and came to Hong Kong with dad when l was five. He worked as an assistant in Chungking Mansions. After my mum's death. he very rarely talked. And we never ate ice cream. The fact that we're both quiet and subtle... ...probably explains the close bond between us. What are you thinking of? And why the ice cream? You know l don't like ice cream. lt's too cold... ...and it gives me the runs. You're crazy Let me out What are you playing at? What are you doing? l'll kill you Open this door You hear? Paging 9090. l'd like to leave a message. l'll meet his frinds tomorrow. Let me know where and when. lt's crystal clear...crystal clear... l just want to check that l've got the right place. lt's a fast-food store, not a barber shop. You may think that we're making a lot of money. What price a human life? Depends on your luck. Business can be slack for ages. So, to make a living... ...l'll occasionally invest in other businesses. Like debt collection. Thanks. Hold on. l'll get your money. Here. But lately. l've suffered quite a few injuries. l hate digging bullets out of my own body. lt's very exhausting. l went to bed early that night. When l awoke next morning, l came to a decision. Lady, we're closed. Two weeks after l was injured, l asked her out. l wanted to tell her my decision. But... l didn't show up. l'm sure she'll come looking for me in a couple of days. After all, we've been partners for a long time. Being partners, you get to understand each other. Almost able to read each other's minds. l'd often leave her some clues... ...to trace my actions, or my whereabouts. After all these years. she's become part of my life. But nothing can remain the same forever. l have to tell her that l desperately want out. But l don't know how to start. So, l've devised another method. A woman may come in asking for me. Please give her this coin... ...and tell her that 1818 is my lucky number. 1818...it's the code for one of the songs in this jukebox. After she's listened to the song. ...she'll understand my message. Okay if l sit here? lt's raining Let's have some fun Oh, it feels so great Come on Why? Perhaps l'm tense... Why? You coming? No? Okay Sure you don't want to come? Made up your mind? Forget it Hey...come and get it lt's not drying. l'll take it to the cleaners for you tomorrow. Okay? Did you hear me? Answer me Open the door Hmm, nice. Fits you well. Whose is this? Why? Do l know you? You bastard What are you doing? Help What now? What do you want? What do you want? l'm overwhelmed Great Guess why l became a blonde? l don't know. So no one will forget me. Looks great You're making fun of me. No, you're very special. l've heard it all before. From whom? You We were together for some time. l had long hair. You called me 'Baby'. Really? Yes. Let bygones be bygones. You like me now, that's fine. l didn't say that. l want some female company. Fine. Just for the night. Maybe you'll like me better in the morning. Get out On your way Get the hell out of here Hello? What l d'you want to tell me? You want to have kids? What's all this crap? You want to get marrid? Fine l'll marry you...but l'll need some time. There's no need? Why? What do you mean? Oh, you dickhead You sent me a wedding invitation? Why did you do that? Oh, l see Congratulations Who's the lucky girl? Blondie? Well, what a perfect couple Me? Her bridesmaid? What should l wear? Chinese style? Me, as a pageboy? Should be interesting Sure. ls Blondie there? l must congratulate her. Okay. Thanks. Bye bye. Lend me a coin for the phone? Blondie? l know you're there. Stop playing games Pick up the phone, will you? Damn you l'll curse your next life Marrying Johnny, eh? l only asked you to pay his electricity bill And now you're marrying him You scheming bitch He doesn't love you He's using you to bear him a son He wants him... ...born in the Year ofthe Pig. lt's already April You won't have enough time Oh, l get it You got pregnant by another guy and told Johnny it's his lf l ever see you again... ...l'll flush you down the pan like the shit you are Hello? Hello? l'm not finished yet Hello? Give me another coin Fuck The bitch has hung up on me No l need a shouler to cry on The night's full ofweirdos. This one seems to turn up wherever l go. l'm fine now. l'll pay you back next time l see you. Same old story. l wish l could tell her... ...you can't solve problems over the phone. You have to talk, face to face. lt that fails, you can punch him on the nose. l keep my thoughts to myself. But somehow, she appears to be able to read my mind. l think you're right. Let's go. Blondie, l know you're there Come out ifyou've got the guts We're gonna torch the place on the count ofthree. One, two, three Wrong floor Blondie Come on out 3 seconds and you burn One, two, three Let's try the next floor. ls that a wig? No way, it comes with age Looks blond, not grey. You related to Blondie? l don't know any Blondie. Her nickname's 'Stowaway' Well? - Funny name - ls she your chick? Leave me alone, you loonies Pervert Follow her... - ls Blondie your daughter? - No. l can see a resemblance. You've forgotten her? - Think hard - Leave it We searched high and low all night. l don't think she knows where this blondie lives. l give up. Everyone protects her, hides her away. Where the hell is she? Why won't anyone help me? The slut lt's not fair What kind of game is this? l'm not playing anymore You must have slept with her. l bet you have, but you won't admit it. Right? You on vacation? Think the whole world's on your side, bitch? Blondie You slut You dare show your face? You're finished You bitch Slut Tramp Fuck you You bitch Where does all this energy come from? Stop eating - watch the door. Blondie could show up any minute now. She comes here with her dad. How do you spell 'Blondie'? Oh, what the hell... Listen to this. l, Blondie, a.k.a. Stowaway, behaved in an ugly & shameless way. l'm returning Johnny Kwong to his rightful girlfriend Charlie Young. l hereby terminate all relations with him. Our signatures binding until death. Great. You think so? l'll make Blondie sign this. Must get her fingerprints and l.D. number on it. Get her dad as a witness. photograph them together. Blondie? You're Blondie? You're Blondie? Yeah, so what? Hey, you Blondie? l'll fucking chop you into little pieces They say women are made ofwater. So are some men. Most folk experience first love in their teens. l was a bit older. Maybe l'm too choosy. On May 30th, 1995... ...l fell in love for the first time. lt was raining that night. l looked at her... ...and had this feeling like l was a store. ...and that she was me. Without any warning, she suddenly enters the store. l don't know how long she'll stay The longer the better, of course. When did you last wash? You need a bath. Huh? You stink all over When did you dye your hair? They say love can change a man. l find myself looking handsome and becoming more charming. Suddenly, l discover my hair's turning blond. Perhaps it's because my mum was Russian. Dad speaks in a Taiwanese dialect... ...which no on can understand... ...because of his strong Russian accent. Hello? Chungking Mansions. Who's speaking? Blondie? On June 22nd, 1995... ...the ltalian team Sampdoria came to play in Hong Kong. l took Charlie to the match. She's a fan of Ruud Gullit. She was ecstatic that night. She insisted in staying on after the game. lt's not right What was the point of playing? They had the better team. Our boys were outclassed There's no miracles in this world. Fat chance Do you know why l came? l was actually hoping for a miracle. Johnny's a great fan of Gullit. l thought he would come. He wouldn't have had time. He's getting married tomorrow. Guess why l was yelling and waving... ...and acting crazy earlier? l hoped he'd see me on TV. He promised me he'd come So why didn't he? l realise that she still misses Johnny, but it hurts me. But l'm an optimistic person. lt's said... ...nothing remains the same forever. But will it apply to Johnny and Charlie? Time will tell. l suppose. Perhaps l'm being a bit too optimistic. A few days later, l invited her to another match. She didn't turn up. l really thought she'd soon get over Johnny. How wrong could l have been? lt was me she got over. l stayed on after the match. As the stadium lights dimmed. l redlised she wouldn't show. l'm heartbroken. Not a hope They say 'love hurts'... ...but it's different with me. Something strange happens. My hair changes colour. Just like with my first love. l also realised how irresponsible l had been in the past. l shouldn't have taken over other people's shops... ...the way l did. Every shop must have its own feeling. This realisation cheered me up and prompted me... ...to change my life. Welcome. Just for one. We'll have a new menu next time you come. Am l keeping you? Get a glass. Be my guest. How's business? What's it cost to set up a place like this? Hi, there. You interested in a business? Just wondered how much a place like this cost. At least a million. When you live out of a suitcase... ...you don't need a place ofyour own. Things have changed, though. Got to start planning ahead. l had a good chat that evening. He even offered to help me... ...if l started up my own place. - Another beer? - Why not? What are you really worth? l'd stayed away from the bar for some time. l couldn't bear hearing that song. But some things you can't escape from. So, after that evening, l never went back. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, happy birthday Happy birthday to you - Okay? - Good. How are you? Dad's fine. No need to worry. l know it's your birthday soon. Sorry l can't be with you. ls mum feeling better now? ls your sister okay? Doing well at school? How was that? Sato-san loves his family very much. Before his present job he used to be a film director. So whenever he has family business to talk about... ...he just makes a video recording. l'm sure his son gets great pleasure in receiving the tapes. l'd like to do the same... ...but who would l send the tapes to? l can't really send them to myself. Maybe l could be like Sato-san's son... ...and imagine the happiness he gets from the tapes. How much for a double room? With twin beds? Yes... Twin room - four fifty. Too damned expensive. You've got to be kidding. Forget it Calm down... Stop filming Go to bed That's enough Go on, get out of here Later that night... ...l caught dad having a sneak look at the tape. He really enjoyed it. My memory's not that good. but... ...l did remember that it was his 60th birthday. God knows why. But he gets great amusement watching it. And l do know that he's happy. Silly devil... Working with someone for a long time... ...you're bound to be influenced in some way. l know that fragrance... ...but l'm not used to smelling it on other women. This suits me just fine. lt's shrunk a bit, though. l always thought the perfume was a bit overpowering. l smelt it on this other woman this afternoon. She wants to see you. l fixed up a meeting. Will you go? l think you should go and get things sorted out. Perhaps it's not such a good idea. Anyway, l thought you'd go. This is for you. l'd like... ...a packet of crisps. Not the red pack, the yellow They sit there together for ages. l wonder what they're talking about? Meanwhile the rain keeps bucketing down. lt's raining so heavily, how will l get home by myself? And just when l need a raincoat... ...he appears at my side. l hope the rain... ...will never stop. l'm not coming in. Then why walk me home? You could've let me walk l was going to do that anyway. You trying to be funny? Oh, what the hell Just fuck off, will you? We came to an agreement. l never agreed anything You insisted on seeing her, not me What d'you want from me now? You think l'm stupid? Oh, get lost You're a cheat and a liar Give me your hand... Why? l've left my mark, okay? You may forget my face, but you won't forget my bite l'm easily recognised, though... ...by the mole on my face. lf a woman with a mole on her face ever comes up to you... ...it could be me. Will you remember that? l'll remember. Will l remember her? Actually, it's not important. For her l was an oasis in her journey through life. l hope she soon reaches her destination... ...and finds her soulmate for life. We all need a partner. When will l find mine? Are we will partners? l don't know how to answer her question. l've come to look at partners from a new angle. As a business partner, she's perfect... ...but not one you could spend your life with. l'm terminating our business relationship. Do me one last favour, will you? l don't know why l agreed. Probably because it's a last favour. l want to place an advert for my friend. l want the front page. The best thing about my job - l don't have to make decisions. Who's to die, when and where, it's all been planned by others. l'm a lazy person. l like others to arrange things for me. But l've been doing some thinking lately. l feel the need for change. Whether it's right or wrong... ...l must make a decision for myself. 'Being photographed will shorten your life'. Seems there's some truth in it. One evening, dad was taken ill. l took him to hospital. A little later, he passed away. Thanks to him, all my life... ...l've always felt like a little boy. He was always there to sort out my problems. Packing his things away that evening... He was always there to sort out my problems. Packing his things away that evening... ...l felt grown-up for the first time. l didn't want to be grown-up... ...l just wanted dad with me. When l left the hotel... ...l took the videotapes with me. l watched them over and over again. Watching dad cooking made me very happy. l know l'll never taste his steaks again... ...but l'll never forget just how they tasted. Oh, hell, it's you again Not the hair Leave it... l'm happy to be your client. Did l ever refuse? l didn't, did l? Just look at me Let go of me... My wife's visiting China... ...and l've some business to attend to. Give me three hours and l'll be back. Three hours, okay? Three hours... Two hours? Two hours and l'll be back. Deal? Trust me. We're old friends, aren't we? People cross all the time. Two hours... Trust me, you have my word We're like brothers, right? You want it written in blood? You're kidding, right? Leave it out... Just one hour, okay? Don't do this... have mercy... Wait... Can l have some small change, please? Thanks. l'm downstairs already. l'm waiting for you. 'Bye. Talk about bad timing... Shortly after dad died, Sato-san returned to Japan. l haven't got much money saved... ...so l can only do what l'm best at - being my own boss. l'm being very cautious this time. l pick only the stronger ones. Ones that won't get hurt easily. Take this one for example. guts of steel. Saves a lot of hassle. Sometimes l run into old acquaintances. Some haven't changed at all. Others l hardly recognise. l'm always glad to see them... ...even though they may not remember me. Of course, there are some exceptions to the rule. On August 29th, 1995... ...l ran into my first love again. l don't think she recognised me. l guess l'm more handsome now. - You're late. - Sorry. - What's up with him? - l've no idea. lt turned quite cold that evening. l hadn't expected winter to come so soon. l'm not used to this kind ofweather. lt seems to have been a long winter. Although l eat well every day... ...l still feel cold. l've got used to working alone. Occasionally l do work with others... ...but not on a regular basis. l've learnt to be more careful. For instance, l won't work in hotels any more. And no more checking out rubbish bins. l firmly believe... ...one mustn't get emotionally involved with one's partner. We rub shoulders with many people every day. Some may become close friends, or confidants. That's why l'm always optimistic. Sometimes it hurts. Not to worry - l try to stay happy. That night, l saw that woman again. l knew we'd never be friends or confidants... ...we'd let too many chances pass us by. Nothing happened, there was no chemistry. Maybe it was the weather... ...but that night l found her very alluring. l'm about to leave, l ask him to take me home. l haven't ridden pillion for a long time... ...nor have l been this close to a man in ages. The road home isn't very long... ...and l know l'll be getting off soon. But at this moment, l'm feeling such lovely warmth.
