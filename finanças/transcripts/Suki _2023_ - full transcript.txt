Ladies and gentlemen. Let us all welcome our queen of the night. The sexy, and alluring. Eba! She's so good. You're so hot! What the fuck? Why aren't you hard yet? My jaw is beginning to hurt. Do better. I'm going to pay you for it. Plus ten thousand if you come. Money down. Okay. Eba. Eba. Eba! - What the fuck? - Eba! My name is Marga! You even came inside! Fuck this. Stay there! I'm going to wash myself. Sir Max! Have a seat, Sir. Have a seat. Take a look at Eba. She's so sexy, isn't she? Tell me, Sir Max. What do you need? Once she's done. Take her directly to the VIP Room, okay? You already know, Sir Max. You're too generous. After Eba's set. Take her directly to the VIP Room. Sir Max? Oh yes! He's a generous tipper. - I know, right? - I got you. Take it off! Take it off! Sir Max, did you know. that there's a new queen in town. Eba! Go, Eba! Excuse me, Sir Max. I'm going to the dressing room because Eba might get stolen by other customers. There are a lot people who want to table her. Okay? I'm going ahead. Bye! Thank you! Wait. What did you just say? Huh? Excuse me! Was I talking to you? Out of my way! Crazy girl. She's really trying to steal your throne. We should take her down. Let's go. You made the right choice. He's professional. Able. And great in bed. It's crazy. I'll handle it. Wait there. I'm going to talk to him. Just a minute. Don't leave your customer alone. Mama Chandra. What's up? I know who you're waiting for. Your regular in paradise who always eats your wrinkled nutsack. Eba. What are you talking about? My nutsack isn't wrinkled. Liar. All nutsacks are wrinkled. Mine is different. Smooth. And pink as a baby. Like tocino? Can I have a look? I might forget that we're not compatible. And swallow it whole. Aren't you forgetting something, Ma? Bro code. Shove it up your ass. There. You see that guy? The ugly, light-skinned person. They want to take you to the VIP. - Come on. - Perfect! I haven't reached my quota yet. Because, look. Place is filled with low-class people tonight. Also. The guy's from Saudi. There's a chance for expensive jewelry. Come on. What if Eba comes? You know. She's still a paying customer. Fuck, Adan! Are you falling in love? No way, man! Look. If I was made to pick between a huge dick, or a tight pussy. I'll choose the tight pussy, Ma. How about my hole? You play too much. But really. Just say yes. Two hours max. Eba's not coming anytime soon. She's a morning girl, remember? Also. She still has to finish her shift. Right? Come on. Alright, fine. Very good. You really don't want my hole? Get out of here. Madame? - We're good to go! - Oh, perfect! Hey! You two. Get out there. Hurry! And try to be like Eba, get some VIP customers! Quickly, girls! Hurry up and make me some money! - Yes, Mommy! - Go! Go! Follow Eba's example, okay? Jesus Christ. Why does it smell so bad here? Maybe it's because... Someone's breath stinks here. She's just full of herself because she's close with the big boss. And here comes our brightest star! Our queen. The carnal desire of every man. Eba! You're so beautiful! Guess what? Someone's waiting for you in the VIP Room. Your regular. Good-smelling. Handsome. Very rich. And hot as hell. And the most famous vlogger... Max! So, what's the hold up? Get dressed. Hurry. Max is waiting for you! Queen? I'm the only queen here. And you? You're full of it, girl. She fights back now, huh? You're nothing. But a second-rate. Trying hard. Copycat! I'm not even doing anything! And that skit is washed. At this point, you're only milking out that stupid skit. Hey! The both of you. Stop this bullshit. Or I'm going to tell our boss. Stop it! Whatever. So your name is Adan. Very biblical. And you? What's your name? I can't. We don't tell people that we come here. That's why we're here, right? It's hard already. So? Are you ready? Come on. Wait. I don't suck dick. What can you do? But... I let people fuck me. - Take it. - Wait. You need to add more for this. That's fine. I got it. Put it in. Hurry. Hurry. Faster. I thought you weren't coming. Well, I don't have much to do. And I already finished shooting my content. Besides... I missed you. You're a good vlogger, but a bad liar. Huh? You were just here last night, and... You already miss me? That's why I'm telling you. Let's move in together. Here we go again. It's not that simple, Max. We live in different worlds. What about your family? Or your followers? What's going to happen if they find out I'm a call girl? Don't mind them. Let them think what they want to think. Are you stupid? That's not possible. It's your work. We're fine where we are. Here. This is too much. Just don't let other people VIP you, okay? You're so generous. There's more where that came from. Do you remember when Marga was new? She was so hot to watch. But now, she's boring. Because she's old. You know how it goes. Girls have an expiration date. Marga has been here for four years already. Take care, sir. What do you need, Ma'am? I want to talk to Eba. Is she here? You're not allowed here, Ma'am. Who told you that I can't come in here? I want to talk to my daughter. You got your quota because of vlogger boy again, didn't you? Maybe you have a magical pussy. He's too set on you. He comes in almost every night. Eba? Were you the one who told this idiot that I can't come in here? I tried to stop her but she forced herself in. What do you mean, "stop"? Mom, please don't make a scandal here, the Boss might get mad. What Boss are you talking about? Why don't you tell your "Boss" to go fuck himself. Did you know, during my time... He was on his knees, begging me. Just to let him fuck me. Well? Was he the one who put the ban on me? Is he here? Only ten thousand? You're not only a slut. You're also an idiot! What can I do with this? Rice is too expensive nowadays. Your siblings eat too much. Take them off my hands if you want. I just gave you something not so long ago. What do you mean, "gave"? Huh? Mind your own business! I really should have aborted you before! You don't know how to be grateful! Get off me. Well? Are you using again? So? Are you going to add more? Or shall I make a bigger scene? Add some already. She's not going to stop. Go on, Ma'am. There! That wasn't so hard, was it? You just wanted some drama. What a pain. Don't cry. Just let it go. It's really hard to take care of a drug-addicted mother. That's Adan. Very talented, young, and fresh. Marga? Tessa? I thought you weren't coming? Well, this one. Got stuck with her D.O.M. After he's done. Reserve him for me, okay? Not possible. You're too late. How so? To who? Unbelievable. She's really busting your balls, isn't she? She's still trying to fuck you over here? Well. Just grab a seat here in the middle. So you have a nice view. Go on. See? A courtside view of Adan. I'll leave you to it, okay? Look at your Adan go. What are you doing? Making you happy. You look stressed. You don't have to do that. Just take it. People might think I'm cheap. Wait for me. Okay? You don't have to take me to the VIP. Looks like she got one over you again. That's where you're wrong. Why? You're planning something, aren't you? Watch me. She's really going to do everything just piss you off, is she? Would you look at this bitch! She pelted me with ice! Fuck you! What's the matter with you? We should take this to the next level. Let's give these guys a show. You're so good! Adan! Fuck! It's too fucking good! So good. You're so good, Adan. Fuck! It's so good! Don't stop, I'm almost there. I'm cumming, Adan! Fuck. I'm about to cum. Why are you so quiet? You're not talking. What kind of face is that? You let it get to you again. I already told you to just brush Marga off. You know what she's like. Now your day's ruined. You know what we should do? We come back there tomorrow. And we don't let Marga anywhere near Adan. We're not going back there. Huh? Fuck this night. Let's get some sleep. Wait, why? What? It's like you're giving Adan to Marga. If Marga wants to, she can let that fuckboy live in her pussy, for all I care. What were you thinking? Why did you pull that shit? Nothing. I just wanted you. You were hot. Why don't you sit next to me? You really think I'll sit next to you? After that bullshit that you pulled? You're lucky the manager didn't get mad. We almost turned his bar into a sex den. If he didn't get angry. It just means that he liked it. Plus. I'm paying you. You're so full of yourself, are you? In the club. People pay to fuck me. But in here? I'm the one who's paying. Just as it should be. You want someone good and handsome, right? What if I just took you home? No way. Then you won't have to pay. You're an idiot. You still good to go? I'll pass. Just go and have a threesome. You're boring. Shit. Eba. Why did you go home? I thought you'll wait for me. You're such a playboy! Idol. Don't you want to leave yet? I'm just going to finish this. For better sleep. Alright, then. Enjoy. Here, bro. - What's that? - Split it between you guys. For breakfast. Thank you, idol. This is why I'm a fan. That's nothing. Really one for the books. What can I do? I'm in too deep. You're lucky. Your customer was wild. She's like a pornstar! And you, too! But... I think your girl, Eba, looked jealous. She walked out. You know what I think? I think she's already in love with you. For sure! You're the only guy she tables. Okay, well. I'll be going, then. Thanks again. No problem. Thank you. Yo! Adan gave money for breakfast. Eba! What? It's only one o' clock. Why are you waking me up? What's the matter with you? Get up! Adan's here. Really? I told you. Go and get dressed. He's waiting for you downstairs. So? What are you doing here? And how did you know my address? You're not gonna offer me a seat? Easy. One at a time, please. Looks like you had terrible sleep. I asked Leng for your address. I just came by to... Give this back. Why? I already told you. I don't need it. Keep it. What do you take me for? A cheapskate? That isn't what I mean. Look, we've known each other for a while now. You always take me to the VIP. I just thought that. It's not right to take money from you anymore. It's fine. You gave me a lap dance. This is payment. And we both know that nothing's free in our profession. Why are you even mad at me? I told you to wait for me last night. But you left so suddenly. Are you stupid? You fucked Marga on-stage and you still wanted me to wait for you? Why? You're jealous, aren't you? In your dreams! We're all prostitutes here! You know Marga was just fucking with me and you still went with it? I wasn't aware. You're really stupid, then. Just go home! Adan, wait up! Have some juice. No, thank you. Are you sure? I'm going ahead. I think she's on her period. Sway those hips. Sway them more! Don't freeze up! You won't earn with that kind of dancing! Good Lord. Add some feelings to it, girls. You all look like dancing bamboo trees. My God! Who would want to table you with that? You won't get fucked with that performance. Hey! Take those off already! Hurry up! Those should've been off by the middle of the song! My God. Don't make the customers wait on you. Hey. Wait a minute. Get the fuck out of here. Stop that shit already. They're all hopeless. That's right. We're going to practice. Hey! Excuse me? We're scheduled here today. The Boss knows it. Marga. You're shameless! Do you think that you're still the queen? You're washed up! This is Eba's paradise now! And you know what, Marga? You have a shitty personality. If I know. Nobody wants you. You talk too much. Is that so? Huh? You're disgusting. You talk all this shit about me, huh? You're washed up! Is that so? I have something for you. You're nothing anymore! Take this. Here. Choke on this. Your breath fucking stinks. What? I'm going to tell the Boss! Just fucking try! - Then tell him! - You fucking animals! You don't have a pussy, so the Boss won't care. What a nuisance. So? The three of you. Get out! Stop dragging your feet. Hurry up! Are you crazy? Why did you drive Adan away? He even made the effort to come visit you. I was fucking with him. But really. You're jealous, aren't you? I mean. Even your name is compatible. Eba at Adan. Of Paradise. Are you stupid? Of course not. You're already in love with Adan. That's why you don't want to settle with vlogger boy. You talk too much. Just eat this eggplant so you can shut up. What a bad sport. Did you know that we have a new queen? Eba! Go Eba! Do you remember when Marga was new? She was so hot to watch. But now? She's boring. Do you think that you're still the queen? You're washed up! This is Eba's paradise now! Damn you to hell! Damn all of you to hell. Damn all of you to hell! All of you are worthless. - Boknoy! - Adan! I brought some food and clothes for you. Go and change because you're getting too smelly! Just in time! The worms in my stomach finally has something to eat! It's scarce today. We haven't even had our breakfast yet. And it's already afternoon. Alright. Go ahead and eat. - Give me some! - Me first! This is mine! Hey! Hey! Don't rush. You might get a stomachache. We don't want that. The people are being cheap today. Maybe your acting's not convincing? That's not true. We're trying our best. Show him, Boknoy. Alright. Show me. Please give us something. Me and my brothers haven't eaten in days. Our father has tuberculosis. He can't work anymore. Please give us something, please. So that's what it is. Listen to me. Never say that your father has tuberculosis. Because if people find out... They'll stay away. You won't get anything. Am I right? So it was your fault, Boknoy! He's right! I'm sorry! Take this. Keep it. So you can buy food even if it's scarce. You alright with that? Thank you, Adan. Good. Go ahead and eat. Remember this, you three. Never use that to buy rugby or solvent. If I catch you guys. Believe me. I'll bang all of your heads together. Hello, Adan? We're beggars, not drug addicts! Okay? That's good. After you eat, change into those clothes I brought. You're beginning to smell. That old customer of mine was a creep. What happened? My pussy was already sore but he didn't want to stop. Fuck him. At least your pussy was used. But mine? Might already be full of cobwebs. I didn't even get one VIP. Believe me. If the guy smells like shit, you'll get what I mean. Hey, Eba! Hurry and change. Someone already VIP-ed you. It's Max. Eba! You're so lucky! Can you give me some? You're crazy. Mama Girlie, did the Boss approve? Of course he will. Max is too generous. That guy's crazy about you. Listen to what I say. Hey, Eba. Don't even think about settling down yet. Because you're going to waste the money that I'm going to earn from you. Always remember that. Okay? Okay? Believe me, Mommy Girlie. That's not going to happen anytime soon. I'll pass on that. Well. I hope so! So? What are you waiting for? Get dressed already so you can go to your lover boy. Hurry up and change! This girl. Are you by yourself? Why don't you try me? I can bring you to paradise. Like Eba. Sorry, Eba's who I want. I'm better than her. Excuse me? Excuse me, Marga. Your customer arrived. There. Look! What are you waiting for? Hurry up and go! I can't believe this woman. What a nuisance. Hello, Boss Max. Have a seat. There. I'll leave you with Eba. Okay? She's feisty. She's good. Look at this handsome guy. I'll leave you to it, okay? Bye! Don't you think I'll melt with a stare like that? You're so beautiful. Aren't we going to the VIP Room? Mommy Girlie told me I was booked tonight. Time's getting wasted. That's fine. Let's stay here for a while. Do you want to eat? I ordered some food. It's coming. Is something wrong? Why don't you want to go to the VIP Room? You already know that if we come in there. We're just going to have sex. But isn't that why you're always booking me? That was before. It's different now. What's wrong? Is it wrong to fall in love? Is that forbidden? That's why. Let's stay here for a bit. I can prove to you that it's not only about the sex. It's good that you came back. Of course. So? What do you want to do tonight? It's because... I want him again. Adan. VIP? Yes. Alright. I'll take care of it. I'll go talk to him. Hi, Adan. Your client from Saudi wants to VIP you again. He's there. He looks eager. You probably did too good, that's why he's back. I'll pass for now, Mama Chandra. Come on, don't waste it. You never know. He might give you his jewelry. You'll be rich! I'm not in the mood. You're not in the mood? Or you're out of cum? After fucking someone on the stage last night? What is it? Are you trying to be a tease? Whatever. Here. So you still get your cut. This guy. This is why I'm friends with you. You really are my favorite. Come here. So what am I gonna say to him? Just tell him I have COVID. Or the crabs. Will you stop that? It might come true. The mouth has power. Especially with us, who suck people dry. Alright, Ma. It's your call. Fine. Bye. Madame! He can't. My work is so toxic. Too much bullshit. Too much bashers. It's as if they think they run my life. It's not their content but they still talk too much. Fuck. They deserve a big "Fuck you". Chill out. Then just stop being a vlogger. Find something else to do. Like what? An... Eight-to-five office job? Or call center? How can I visit you with a job like that? So, no. I'll stick to vlogging. It pays well. There you go. Stop complaining, then. How about you? When are you going to stop? Here? I want to. But how? Who wants to be a prostitute? But we're the same. Both of us earn big at our jobs. But in my case. I still have siblings to take care of. Until when? Until I save enough. I want to graduate from college. But that's a long way ahead. We have fast expiration dates here. They say that once you pass twenty, you're too old. Like Marga. Why don't you just accept my offer? The one where we move in together. It's not that simple, Max. Yes, I let you fuck me. But there are no emotions involved. It's just work. Maybe we can be friends? Do you want me to come with you only because of money? It's better this way. If you get horny. Then take me to the VIP. We shouldn't complicate things. So that's how it is? I'll just wait for your expiration date, then. Looks like your girl Eba isn't coming. Will you stop being negative? She's coming. I disagree. Most likely, she's angry at you. I mean, after giving a live show in front of her? Who won't get mad? Fuck that. She dances naked. You're a bit slow, aren't you? After the many women that you've fucked, you still don't know how they think? What are you talking about? Every descendant of Eba (Eve) is the jealous type. Her name is coincidentally Eba. So, there! The jealousy is doubled. Stay there. The morning girls are here. Marga! Tessa! Hi, Mama Chandra. Hello. Perfect attendance. You're here everyday. Reserve Adan for me, will you? I can't. He's not feeling well. I don't believe that for a second. Where is he? What are you doing? So grumpy! Stop waiting for Eba. She's getting wasted with her suitor. And if there's alcohol, something's brewing. You know how that will end up. Getting fucked up. To getting fucked. I'm going home. I feel sick. You kissed me. So you might get it. Where are you going? He turned down your pretty face? Here. You have lots today. Kokoy! Where have you been? I'm hungry! Why aren't you helping us out? Whatever. Let's eat! What about Boknoy? Look. Let him be. He can take care of himself. Fine. Let's eat this before it spoils. Come on. Hey, kids. Adan! Leave those. Come with me. I'll treat you to pares. Just give us money, Adan. This is fine. Your choice. I mean... You don't know this, but... I also lived on those kinds of food before. If it's spaghetti. Leave it alone. It spoils easy. You might get sick. Adan. I thought you escaped from a boys town? Where's your mom and dad? I don't know. People told me. I was left in front of an orphanage. You're amazing. You were just like us before. Now, you have a kickass job. I want to be like you when I grow up. My job's not easy, you know! You need a strong gut. And you guys are still young. So, once you grow up... Pick a job that you'll love. There's nothing wrong with dreaming, right? By the way... I have a job for you guys tomorrow. My head feels so heavy. Of course. You're hungover. Why don't you drink that already? So you can have it easy later. Fuck alcohol. You answer it, Leng. I hope it's not people from the electric company. Tell them we're already paid for. I got it. Just a minute! Eba, come here! There's a surprise for you! Don't tell me Adan's there again. If he is, then tell him to go fuck himself! Shut up and come here already! Stop being so stubborn. Who are those kids? Who are you guys? We're friends of Adan. Are you Eba? Yeah. Why? - Because you're so pretty. - Yeah! I can see why Adan likes you. That's right! So, that's why. Here. Flowers for you. And chocolates. Who knew Adan could be so sweet? Give me some. Hands off, dude! It's hard being fat, you know? Do you want to get fat? Give me some already. Later! You're selfish. - Where have you guys been? - Adan! What took you so long? We were trying to make a living, you know. So? How did the job go? It went great, Adan. Mission accomplished! That's what I'm talking about! You guys are dependable. What did she say? Was she moody? Not at all. She had a big smile on her face. Show him. It was like this, Adan. Great! Then she said "Thank you". Because of that, you guys get a bonus. Wow! Here. Split it. Adan? Only 400? I know. I'll make it up to you. I'm a bit tight. Don't tell me you're being lazy, Adan. Crazy kid. Do I look lazy to you? I'm just going to visit someone. We know who you're visiting. It's Eba. Right? Bring us with you! Kids aren't allowed. Come on. So? I'll be going ahead. Take care, you two. Adan! Good luck! That's my baby! I love you, Eba! I'm taking you home! Sometimes... There are stupid men. Am I right? Look at this idiot. - He's wasting his money. - That's my baby! I love you, Eba! - Does that mean... - I'm taking you home! I'm also wasting my money on you? Huh? If you think you're wasting money on Marga. Not with me. Wow! Are you trying to start drama, Tessa? I can make his dick hard as a rock. I'm the only one who can make his dick hard. I don't know why he's being so timid. Alright. Make it hard, then. Let's do it in the VIP Room. Excuse me, girls? Sir? Your VIP Room is ready. Thank you. Oh my God, I love you! Keep him safe. Make sure he doesn't lose his things. He might complain in his vlog if he does. - Yes, Boss. - And remember... He's a super VIP in this club. Copy, Sir. I'll handle it, Eba. It's okay. Don't worry. He's safe. You okay, Max? I got it, Eba. Eba! What happened? Why did he get shit-faced? Did you reject him? Hell if I know. Maybe he has a lot of issues. Jesus, Eba. You're wasting money. Eba? Looks like you're free. Can I take you to the VIP Room? How long have you been here? Yeah. You were dancing when I arrived. I didn't know you were that good. Why didn't you just table Marga? I didn't come here for her. I came for you. You even paid. You're crazy. You were paying for me before, right? Now we're even. Am I right? What were you thinking? It's not even your day off. I felt like you didn't want to come visit me in the gay bar anymore. I didn't want to lose a beautiful regular. Like you. That's all? Should I have other reasons? I don't know. It was your choice to come here. But, you're right. There's another reason. You. So? Are you really sure you're doing this? Of course. Don't worry. I'm still paying my half here. At least until you find a new housemate. That's not what I mean. I'll be frank. Okay? You didn't settle with the vlogger boy, but you settled with the call boy. I don't know if you're making the right decision. You know what we do for a living. Prostitution. The only people who can understand us are prostitutes, as well. So, if I were to choose Max, he's always going to be jealous. I never saw the both of us together. See? I knew it. You love Adan. Did you guys say "I love you" already? Not yet. Do you really need that? I think so. I don't know. Come on. Let's go. What do you think? Adan and Eba's paradise. Paradise. I'm okay anywhere. As long as we don't fight. Just remember our agreement, okay? Nobody gets jealous. So there's nothing to fight about. That alright? Of course. Why the long face? It's your fault. You settled with someone hot. You're so full of yourself. What's wrong? Am I not hot enough? Will I come with you if you weren't hot? There we go. But seriously. Our agreement. We don't get jealous. We know what we do for a living. Come on. Let's have a look upstairs. Let's go. What's the occasion? Is it your birthday? What are you talking about? It doesn't have to be an occasion. Where are you going? Work. I'm doing this to celebrate, and you're leaving? I'll just leave, too. Stop being so sensitive. What do want me to do? Be happy? You're not even making plans for us. I'm sorry, okay? I'm new to this. You're my first serious relationship. But okay. I won't leave. I knew it. Fuck this job. Seriously. Our honeymoon is ruined. Make it up to me, okay? Make sure it's a hot honeymoon. Promise. I'll make your eyes roll back. And make you shout in pleasure. Let's do this later. I'm going to cook our dinner. Come on. You just made Junior mad. Junior, behave. Fine. I'll just help you cook. What's gonna happen now? Eba quits the club? No, she's still coming in. Good thing her boyfriend's cool with it. Of course. People need to eat. And... What will happen to her siblings? They already talked about it. Nobody gets jealous. That won't last long. Adan will get jealous once Eba lets Max fuck her. And... Men want their girlfriends to be exclusive. Even if their girlfriend is a prostitute. Remember this. True love doesn't exist. Why are you so pessimistic? That's funny. Those people beat you up in Luneta. Because you didn't want to get your dick sucked. But still... You ended up in a gay bar. It is what it is. This is absolutely better than Being a criminal. True. I have a question for you. Don't be offended though. Promise? Promise. If a customer requests for a blowjob, - Do you do it? - What kind of question is that, babe? The food's delicious, by the way. Come on. I won't judge. Just don't do it again. See? You think I suck dick. It's the first time we're trying to know each other. And you're trying to be coy. Here. Hope to die. I do them, but I don't suck dick. Because if I do that, it's like I'm one of them. Seriously? It's true. It's hard being a prostitute. You became one because of your drug addict ex-prostitute mother. I became one because... of my parents who abandoned me. I want to graduate from school. You? Me? I haven't thought about it. I've only studied until Grade 6. Maybe I'll just save a lot of money. What happens if you spend it all? That's a problem for another day. Okay? Adan, you're so good! Adan! I love you. I thought that "I love yous" are unnecessary? Why are you so affected that he didn't say it back? Come on, it's as if you don't know me. Of course I still want to hear Adan say it. Look. If I were you... Don't think about it too much. Adan's not going to move in with you if he doesn't love you. Besides, you used to pay him to have sex with you. And.,, Maybe he's just not used to saying "I love you". Especially in our industry. Or maybe he finds it too cheesy. You're right. Maybe it's just me. Maybe. Snatcher! He's a snatcher! Catch him! Catch him! Let's help Boknoy! Give me that! Trying to be a hero, huh? Boknoy! Boknoy, are you okay? Boknoy! Help! Help! Stop the car! Please! Wake up, Boknoy! Don't let go, Boknoy! Boknoy! God, please! Oh my god, what happened to you? This isn't mine. This is Boknoy's. Boknoy? A kid I have under my wing. A snatcher stabbed him. I just brought him to the hospital. You almost gave me a heart attack! Why didn't you text? I didn't have the time. He's 50/50. He's only a kid! That motherfucker! Relax. I'm going to work. Get some sleep first. Eba, I can't! I need money for Boknoy's hospital bills! I'm the only one he depends on! He doesn't have a family! - Did you bring him to a private hospital? - Yes. He might die in a public one. Let me help. - I have a little saved up. - Don't! I got it. I can find a way. Okay? Marco. Don't be an asshole. Your customer last night was complaining. Your regular? The old woman? She says you're trying to swindle her. Fuck this. Why not? I made her cum a lot of times. - You made a 72 year old woman cum? - Sure! That's what I'm talking about! Actually, you're right. Swindle her but don't make it too obvious. Don't bite more than you can chew. Don't be greedy next time. - Okay. - Mommy Chandra! What? You're just in time. It's good that you're back. Your regular from Saudi just texted. He wants to VIP you again. I think he's addicted to you. I don't care how many. Give me all the VIP's you can get. I really need the money. I have an emergency. What? Are you sure your dick can take it? Give me a big tip. Okay? Sure. Just give me your best. There. Faster! Faster! It hurts. It hurts! It hurts! Wait a minute! Put it on me. My pussy is dry. What's wrong? It's not good? I'm on menopause, so it dries easy. Don't stop. Don't stop. That's good. Shit! You fuck me so good. Fuck you. It's so good. Don't stop! Shit! Shit. Fuck. What the fuck, Eba? What's the matter with you? You know that the customer is always right! Max wanted to VIP you. Why didn't you accept? You already know he's one of our valued clients. He's a super VIP! He puts out serious money in this club! What do you want to happen, Eba? You want him to go to another club? I'm still okay with getting tabled, Boss. That's the problem! He left because you only want to get tabled! When did you become so stupid, Eba? Ever since you settled with that call boy. What? You think he doesn't fuck other people? Boss. Boss, your heart. Watch your blood pressure, Boss. You get a heart attack. Relax! Eba. Please use your head next time. Remember this. You won't always be in demand. Just look at Marga! Nobody wants her anymore! Eba. Your pussy is the only thing people come here for. So use it as much as you can before it expires! What will happen to your siblings if if you don't earn money? Nothing! That's foul, Boss. Keep them out of this. "Keep them out of this"? Why? What are you doing here, anyway? Don't be like your mom. She was our star dancer before. She was claimed by your father. Left her. Now, she's a drug-addict! I'm going home. I'm sleepy. How's Boknoy? He's stable. But he's still in the ICU. I'm sorry, I ate ahead of you. I thought you were coming late. That's fine. Have you paid the hospital bills in full? I found a way already. I have to tell you something. I might quit the club. Why? Did something happen? The Boss got mad at me. I didn't want to get VIP-ed anymore. He was mad because it was Max. The vlogger? Yeah. I know him. Will you pass me the water? Thanks. You guys are having fun, huh? Two professional fuckers. Why don't you sell it on a pornsite so you can earn from it? I'm getting wet. It's so big! I can see why Eba settled with this guy. He's a champion in sex. He was so good. Wow! There! Oh? Eba! Why don't you have a look? This was only last night. I think I might have orgasmed six times. So good. Die, you fucking bitch! It's so good, right? You're crazy! You're here. We need to talk. I saw you and Marga. And what's wrong with that? It's work. What kind of fucking work was that? It was disgusting! It's always like this. And you say it's work? What about me? What about my feelings? Fuck it all, then! We're really going to fight about this? Yeah, I fucked Marga and other people. Because I need a huge amount of money! For Boknoy! Well, if that's the case, then why didn't you accept my offer? I could have helped. Why? Where does your money come from? By fucking other people too, right? Fucking. Will you stop it? Knock it off! Didn't we have an agreement that we won't get jealous, because we don't want to fight? Are you dumb? Isn't it obvious that I can't do it? Come on! Let's just stop being prostitutes. What happens after we stop? What are we going to do? Be practical. Please. I don't know how to do anything else. Even the simplest jobs might not accept me. Because I didn't graduate from elementary, Eba. Fuck you. Stay there. Don't even think about sleeping upstairs. Eba. So? Why did you call me? Nothing. I just want you to fuck me. Stop here for a bit. Is something the matter? Don't you want to? Then I'll just find somebody else. No, no! Come on. Get in the car. I can't believe this shit. Hurry. Follow that car. Really? A motel? Fuck. What's the important thing about Eba? You sure you're not trying to fuck her over? Because you're just wasting time. You're right. I'm fucking her over. But I know I'm not wasting time here. You know, that Eba. She's fake. That's why she seems innocent. Loyal. Doesn't let herself get VIP-ed, or let other men fuck her. But this is the truth. What do you think they're going to do in a motel? Rock, paper, scissors? Do you believe me now? Fuck this. You fucking bitch. You fucking bitch! Where have you been? Huh? You fucking slut! Where have you been? Huh? Who were you with? Come here. You fucking bitch. Stop it! That hurts! Where have you been? Huh? What the hell is your problem? Who were you with? Huh? Come here. You fucking slut! What the fuck is your problem? You fucking cheated on me! You let that asshole Max fuck you? - I don't want to talk to you. - Don't turn your back on me! Fuck you! I'm not with you so you can just hurt me! Shut up, you fucking bitch! You're not the one who feeds me! You're a fucking animal! Why did you cheat on me? What does he have that I don't? You're choosing that guy over me? You don't know what you're talking about. "Don't know"? I saw you going in a motel! You're a hypocrite! You're the only one who can fuck other people? I can't? So that's why you came with him? Because you're insensitive! I told you many times that I can't not get jealous. But did you ever listen? Huh? You're right. I came with him. But it's only because I want to get back at you. I can't take having sex with other people anymore! Do you know why? Huh? Because I love you. You fucking asshole. But what am I to you? Huh? A fuck toy? A slave? You haven't even said "I love you" to me yet! That's enough. I'm sorry. You hurt me. You hurt me! That's enough. I'm sorry, okay? Get off me! Get away from me! Screw you. Wait a sec, sir. Mom! No wonder I can't get any. What are you doing here? Why are you still out here? You're past your prime! Besides, I give you money. What money? It isn't enough. What about my vice? Stupid. And men will go for any available woman. You're arrogant! You're young, for now. But you'll grow old in this job, like me. Nobody can get out of being a prostitute. Remember that. Ugh, I'm leaving. Stop it! Leave me alone! Hey, this guy is mine! Shit, she's so annoying!
