In 700 meters, turn left at zaimokucho. All you Taurus people out there, it might be best to lay low for a while. Next, gemini. It's your lucky day! Fortune comes from the west. If traveling, visit western areas like kansai or kyushu. Or maybe do something with names related to west. Not really sure, actually. Next, cancer. Carelessness is your foe. Yeah? Are you with imari? Look... You've missed her, no? She wants to see dad at work. You two be nice to each other. Always her way. Okay, zaimokucho. "Kawauso antiques" "We make antiques!” Imari, what are you studying? What are you studying? You sound like a parent. Fortune comes from the west... Imari, button your shirt up. What? I gotta go too? To get his guard down. You mean, "put him at ease." You two are? Excuse us... No solicitors. No, it's the reverse. I'm... Reverse? Excuse me, this is... Who I am, and... I'm hoping to see your warehouse. Antiques? Yes. It's my daughter. She's an intern. Hi there. Come in. Great, thank you. Thank you so much, sir. What a magnificent garden. He likes weird stuff. I wish he was like your kid. Not much different, really. May be dusty as I haven't opened it lately. Excuse us. This way. I'll use these. For the girl. Wow, impressive. Want to go upstairs? Can we? Yes, please. It was my dad's pastime. Can't believe he spent so much on lumps of dirt. Alright... Well, have a look around. I don't know much about antiques. Yes, I'll check them out. Go ahead. Thank you so much. Sure. "Korean tea bowl, bagworm." Bagworm? Fumai matsudaira loved this bowl and named it. Alright. What's this? Idiot! Don't touch it like it's nothing! I'd like to turn the warehouse into a café. It'd be great if you'd take them all. I'll take what I can fit in my car. I see. 10 million yen? 10 million yen? Right. My dad said you could buy a car with this alone. Where is it from? A shop named hiwatari kaikado. Hiwatari? It's a long-established dealer near here. Then, would you sell us just this piece? I'll have café au lait in it. Café au lait? As daimyo shibata received it from nobunaga oda, the blue ido tea bowl is named "shibata." It's a designated cultural asset. Yours is a clever imitation. Let me look it over. The way the patterns rest and this tint. From this angle it's identical to the original. The unique texture of the ido tea bowls and a lovely display of shark skin, too. Probably copied from a catalog. What's shark skin? Look here. It's called the foot ring. See the rough texture around it? Here, feel it. That's shark skin. Still, the dirt on the body looks unnatural. The artist stained it to make it appear old. In the pottery world, it's not rare to reproduce famous pieces. If they're reproductions by distinguished Potters, they could be of value. However, this forgery pretends to be older than it is. Unfortunately, it's an authentic forgery, a fake. A fake... Thanks for the cake. A failed shibata reproduction, huh? Pierre, what will you spend? What did you spend? 25,000 yen. What do you want? Aren't you Charles? Charles? Who is Charles? I'm lord Charles Spencer now. An english nobleman. Come on, Pierre is fine. So, how much... How'd you know? The handkerchief. Handkerchief... I'm impressed you noticed. "Hiwatari antique shop" thank you very much. Let's see. How about 5,000 yen? You'll buy it at 5,000 yen and increase the price 10 times. What? You are? Pardon me. This is who I am. Here. Kawauso? Yes, and my client bought this at your shop. I understand tricks between dealers. But tricking an amateur is fraud. Hello there. - Leave us. - Yes, sir. Nice to meet you. I'm hiwatari, the owner. - Hello. - Hi. Hello. Oh, you too. You accused your client falsely to get the price down, and now you're accusing us falsely to sell it at a high price. Is this your plan? - Well? - No, not that... I got a call you acquired some oribe. Seiichiro tanahashi? Yes, he's on TV quite often. I'm glad you dropped by, sir. May I ask you something? - Would you mind appraising this piece here? - Ok. It's well-made. Is it? The shark skin is not bad. - 5,000 yen. - 5,000 yen. As it's "blue" ido type bowl, for the "blue spot," I'll up it to 5,500. Nobody can compete with your clever remarks. This is the kind of stuff TV viewers love. Mr. tanahashi is the official connoisseur for the national museum. I know. But it's true sometimes one can be deceived by a title. I heard your shop is excellent at such business. You think that stingy Mr. kinuta bought a bowl at 550,000? No way. He actually got it for around 10,000 yen. At 550,000, we'd make a big profit. Yet, at 10,000 yen, it was good service, no? I like the box. The wood box was one of daimyo tools in the edo era. It'll look better in the box. Really. Look, I'll pay 20,000 yen for the box, seeing as you came such a long way. Be careful, boss. Like in folklore, an otter can transform into a young woman. Maybe you've a cute tail, do you? Stop it, seriously. It's like new, so too bad about the low price. Come back again once it becomes an antique. Here, 25,500 yen. Have a safe trip back home to the river, otter. - Is this okay? - No. "Fortune comes from the west." What a swindle. A swindler has no right to say that. No, I'm in the service industry. You talk the same way they do. I'm not like them. Did they do anything to you? Who's your mom's new boyfriend? Aha, changing the subject. What country is he from? Why do you even care? After you left, I cleaned up... And found these. Let me look them over. Have some. Thanks. "Tsusen-in." This is... A treasure? A record of a peasant uprising. A peasant uprising. Is it valuable? It's not that rare. Many revolts occurred back then. Like demonstrations today. Demonstrations? I see. One of my clients collects stuff like this. So, I don't mind taking it. Oh, one more thing. May I see the warehouse again? Think you'll find something? No, don't think I will. It'd be rude to leave without checking. Is it alright? Sure, it's free to look. Thank you. Through here? Excuse us. - I'll get the key. - Oh, the key. - Wait outside? - Yeah. Imari, check it out. What? It was right, damn right. The horoscope was right. Hang on, hang on a sec. "To Mr. tsusen-in, from eki." "Please allow me to give you this bowl." This letter means sen no rikyu gave tsusen-in a tea bowl as a memento. But the peasants' uprising. No, it was sen no rikyu. The date is... April 21st, 1591. Wait, 21st? The day hideyoshi ordered him to commit seppuku. None of the old tea bowl books... "Tennojiya kaiki" "chaki meibutsu shu" has information... About it. Is it a phantom tea bowl? Is it real? Don't touch it like it's nothing! Careful! It means... if the letter is here then... Move. Out of the way. Why did you shut it? This, absolutely no touching, okay? It means... if there's a letter, there's a bowl. Weren't you just taken for a ride? What are you making? The battle of the ardennes. Who cares? How can you feed yourself? I can't feed myself plastic. For god's sake. Imbecile. It's so lifelike. This one's different. Not this one either... a red cylindrical. Not this one. Not this either. Found it. Found it, "tsusen-in." As expected, it's chojiro's black raku. Find anything? What? Let's see... Huh? Well, Mr. kinuta. I hate to tell you this, but... All of them are reproductions that were made recently. Seems the artists were very skillful with a knowledge of Clay, glaze, and kiln. But they're all somewhat careless, or weak. Weak? They just followed the originals, so they aren't of much interest. The originals are worth two or three more zeros, maybe five or six more zeros than the forgeries. Still, given you have so many, I guess we can do business. May I take them all? You don't mind? Well, let's see... Supposing 5,000 yen for each, how about a round number, like a million yen. A million yen! It's the best I can do. Was the peasant letter fake too? Peasant letter? Well, I do know a collector into peasant revolt merchandise. That's a relief. I feel bad to force you to buy it. Alright, it's a deal. A million. Thank you so much. Let's deal with it tomorrow. - Actually... - It's late. Hey wait, Mr. kinuta? Shit, I want beer. You can drive, right? I told you, right? I did, remember? What a lovely souvenir we got. Excuse me. Sea urchin, please. Sea urchin? Eat mine, idiot. Here you go. Two pieces, all yours. What did you talk about with the girl? - Nothing. - Thank you, boss. - This meat is amazingly good. - I told you, right? - I did, remember? - I know. It's top-level prime Kobe beef. - The real thing is something, no? - The expensive ones, please. Mr. kawauso? It's too early for our appointment. You're up early too. Come in. Thank you. I already packed them up. What? Oh no... You shouldn't have done that. Well, call when you're done. Thanks. Sorry to trouble you. It's fine. Good... there it is. Now, now. Just like this. Well, here's the million yen. Okay, I got it. Would you sign a receipt? Your name and address, please. Is it fine like this? Yes, thank you. Your copy. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Imari? Imari, we're leaving. Imari! She said she'll be in sakai until it's done. Huh? Oh hey, what? Isn't this good? Let's put it here. No, soldiers don't go there. It's your lucky day. Perfect for shopping. Shopping! Next, gemini. Mel watch out for a trap today. Carelessness is your foe. Carelessness? Wait a sec. Wait, what was the topic again? Right, carelessness. Mr. kinutal what the hell... I'm coming in, Mr. kinuta! Mr. kinuta? Mr. kinuta. Mr. kinuta, I'm coming in. Kinuta, Mr. kinuta? Kinuta? Who are you? That's my question. Wait... wait... okay, please call Mr. kinuta. I am kinuta. Then, your son? The one here a little while ago. Call your son, please. It's about this. You must be the dealer who took the whole lot. Yes, but this one. He left work early today. Left work? Doesn't make sense. Give me his phone number. Or you call him. I'm busy with my dog and grandchild. He watches the house when I'm out. His wage is 900 yen an hour. 900 yen an hour? Wait up! Thanks a lot. Here. Just one. Of course. Thanks. Here, yocchan. Appreciate it. How about top-grade Sushi for all? Seriously? You sure? Great! Here, thanks. Thanks. Welcome. A friend of yours? Wow, it's Mr. kawauso. Perfect timing. Want some Sushi? What a face. Sir, want the great kanbi's autograph? I'll take that. What's wrong? Baring your teeth like a monkey. Scary. Thought you had him. Some drunk customer bought it for 2,000 yen the other day. Kanbi is cheap. Paperboards cost 100 yen. His autographs has increased after death. Right? The life of art is forever. Right? Here. For you is 2,000 yen expensive? Too much? This one... Did you do it? He wrote all the autographs here. Look, it's DiCaprio. He beat the cops' handwriting analysis. What the hell? Yocchan. Three generations in the paper business. Good. He's an expert with paper. There we go, there we go. Cut it! Nice, aren't you. Wow, that's a cool box you got. I wonder who made it. Me, of course. This hairy face is a wood dealer. He can make any box with ease. You're all in cahoots? Gotta pee. He's running away. Where to? He's gone. Wait up! Wait. Running away? It's 'cause you're following me. Hello. Hi. W ait. Hold it! You bastard! You bastard... What are you doing? Well, hello there. Join us. Put the beef and cabbage together. The bread's soaked the sauce nicely. - Thank you. - Dig in. Thanks. Loin is in the back and Chuck roast is closest to the neck. It's high-grade beef. I've worked there 20 years, so the boss gets me choice parts. Even butchers hardly get this. A spoiled boy who sucked his mother's milk till he was four. I gave him too much. Is that so. What a dog you are. Yeah? What's a peasant uprising? Want more? Imari, this is their real house. Don't state the obvious. The forgeries weren't just the bowls, but in the home as well. Pass an egg. It's nuts for him to burst in and talk nonsense while eating our food. I like you! I'm serious. Imari is the first one... Who understands what I make. That a boy! You're so earnest. It's repayment for this choice meat. Well done! Disgusting. By all that's holy, what a gross family. Imari. That's it. We'll have nothing to do with them. Come, imari. Imari, time to go! I won't go. What are you saying? It's the first time... To feel this way. Egg! Seiji, have two. Don't be stupid. Hurry up. - We're leaving. - Have a drink. - No thanks. - Just sit down. That hurts. No, thank you. No no... Let's drink. Think it over calmly. Calmly... What is this? For god's sake. They aren't mixed well. Cold... it's cold. Want some? It's soaked up the flavor. Where is imari? They're both adults. Leave them be. Ow... it hurts. What's up, yasuko? I'm leaving. Leaving? Hey, hold on! Why all of a sudden? For the last 20 years, I've fed my boy, and you. No no, wait wait, just wait. This isn't right. What did I do? Yeah, what did you do? The flavor's all soaked up. The originals are worth two or five or six more zeros than the forgeries. You said they were all fake. If it were real, it'd be a lie. Where is the real bowl? Here? The letter and box were real, not the bowl. That means? It wasn't replaced; It was always fake. Who the hell are you? A small-time Potter. Here you go. There's nothing but cake in the house. It looks delicious. Want some? Imari. Come on. Back home. It looks super yummy. Have a big piece. Say ah! Imari! Do as I say. We're going home! Look who's suddenly a dad. Let's go home. Your mom is worried. All you do is ditch me. That's not true. Think about it. - First off... - P... please stop. Back off! - Sorry. - Seiji! Know where your mom went? - That's it. - Don't touch me. - Come on, dad. - What? Come with me. You're so lame. Liar! Liar? When on earth did I lie to you? The dolphin! The dolphin? The pink dolphin. In the Amazon. Where's mom? - Come on... - Call her. - Whatever. - Call her, now. - Nope. - Why not? - I said no. - Do it. - Let's go. - Hey! Sorry. Two fake dads, huh? Still better than you. What's a pink dolphin? More than 20 chojiro black raku bowls exist. Rikyu always preferred black raku. But it's too ordinary for a memento. It doesn't say anything deep. Even drunk, I can see it now. The note of authentication is real. You figured the bowl was too. People see what they want. Don't patronize me. So, what's your real name? It's best not to win an award. The chairman of the committee, Mr. tanahashi will hand the award. "Incentive award." Congratulations. Thank you, sir. President hiwatari said, he'd like to support young ceramic artists with a passion for the craft. So nicely put. Your skills are splendid. Thank you. This is my wife. Thank you so much. Oh, you've a baby coming. Then, as a gratuity, how about 100,000 yen. Yes. Congrats. One, ten, hundred, thousand, 10 thousand... Welcome. Hon'ami koetsu's red cylindrical tea bowl. It's like a cultural property. A steal at this price. But... It's the reproduction I made. Van gogh painted many sunflowers. Certificates are made to suit our needs. You've wanted to use me all along. If your piece was worthless, tanahashi wouldn't have certified it. You've got skills! So, let's cultivate them. Alright? I love you, okay? Thanks. Hiwatari... Cajoled then dumped you. Now you watch the miser's warehouse. With my crummy bowls in there, they sell at good prices. No wonder your ability is declining. Change now, or you'll hit rock bottom. Why do you keep quiet? Get back if you feel insulted. Why trick a small-time dealer like me? They owe you, no? Thanks. For being kind after I tricked you. Idiot! Why would I be kind to you! Look, think it over carefully. If we have rikyu's letter, the box, and the tea bowl, the number of zeros will be different. You make the bowl, give back my money plus a huge bonus, that's what I mean. A long time ago, hiwatari tricked me and sold me a fake. It was when imari was little. I was young. I trusted a certificate written by a connoisseur. Tanahashi? I ended up selling it to an amateur. It left my reputation in tatters. I had to sell my shop. Since then, I trust only my eyes. Picasso said it took 30 seconds plus 30 years to make a sketch. I've spent 20 years learning to spot the real thing in 20 seconds. You managed to fool me. You've got what it takes. With my help, we can sting hiwatari and tanahashi. The name is written "old fox" but is read as "little fox." Can I trick those sly dogs this way? Idiot. Total idiot. Forget the bowls and the catalog already. Don't just chase history, make it by giving it your all. Make it better than the original. Better than the original... Are the dog and monkey talking about something fun? Here you are. No, we're otter and... Lizard. Can we join in, please. We've got the letter and the box. All we need is the bowl. Why not show originals then replace them with imitations. I mean, if you save the originals, you can play the trick again and again. Easy pickings. So, what's my role in this? "Today in Kyoto" "a dewdrop, the harbor of izumi," "in the bounding main, I shall play alone” what's that? A famous poem? Rikyu wrote it in the letter. My life, to be lost in Kyoto today, is as transient as dew. One drop of life returns to the izumi harbor, the hometown. And fly free in the bounding main. That's what the poem means. What kind of main is that? Idiot. [T's not a main, it's the sea. The ocean. The ocean... Something catch your eye? Oh, sorry. I'm impressed by how handsome he was. Hearing that makes my day! Rikyu was a producer and fixer who manipulated lord hideyoshi. I want people to know about him. First of all, rikyu reminds us of gulls. Gulls? Right! Sogyu tsuda, like rikyu, was a tea master. "Kanshinko" is a quotation from the son of sogyu tsuda. In the book, rikyu is called "gull." See how handsome he is. Oh, I touched the glass. "Sumiyoshi festival folding screen” shows sakai city just after rikyu's life. Gulls fly about. You see? After going to Kyoto, he must have missed the sea breeze and tidal roars. And longed for sakai and the gulls. He was born the son of a fish dealer. Oh, look at that. See that man washing a fish? Must've bought it from the fishery. And the pharmacy. I feel rikyu visited... Looking at the sea, how about I make the bowl blue? The color of water can change. It must've been this color. That's right. This is the very sunset rikyu saw. He most identified his soul with gulls that slept by the shore and flew freely. "Buddhist layman rikyu entered a state of nonattachment" "in sakai, he faced the sea for days" "a white gull, seeing through his state of mind" "calls the man a true friend" "a white gull, seeing through his state of mind" "calls the man a true friend" "rikyu in sakai, a state of nonattachment like the gulls." "Gulls, innocently playing by the shore," "surely screamed, rikyu was their real friend." Nice imitation. Look, a gull by rikyu. If bass, the slugger, drew it, it'd be... This. A gull is a gull. What does "by bass" mean? We'll dream of gulls. No good, huh? So this is the original. Looks great. I like the color. Wait, wait, stop! Tasty. Did you just lick it? It's the original, yocchan. Look, we're making a forgery they will absolutely never figure out. You two make the letter. The box. The bowl. Make one that would fool even rikyu. Are you onto something? Not sure what to do with such freedom. I wonder how rikyu felt. Um? Hideyoshi flattered, then ousted him. If you were him, what ocean would you see in the bowl? How did you get it? I had some savings. And borrowed from my folks. I'm impressed. A million yen bowl. A million? That's outrageous! To me, a million is cheap for this. There, there. Hey, hey, hey. Alright, go ahead. Cry all you like. Grown-ups can't cry when they want. Sometimes, grown-ups should cry. See? Daddy is crying. Cry your heart out. Can you see the ocean? Yeah. It's neither black raku nor red raku. It'll be a rikyu bowl no one's ever seen. It's slimy mud, smooth on the tongue. Try it. Eat it? Hang on... This much? All this? Is it okay? Sour, right? Kibushi Clay includes carbonized organic substances. Tree knots take nutrients from the soil, fall, and make the soil again. Above and below link the ages. Rikyu's time and now are connected. It's time to finish. I'm about done with lunch. Sorry, he's almost done. Knead the mud... And give it your all. You're right. I can only make bowls from the day I Rose from the Clay until the day I return to the Clay. Put it in here? Let me see. Not yet. - Put it here? - Yeah. Hot. This is the ocean. What? It's not locked. I came for my... He's in my clothes. Why are you smiling? What would disturb a virtuoso's eyes? An ex-director of the met said: Need, speed, and greed. These three. A wonderful trio. You reading that again? - "Bass, great American ball player” - Good stuff never tires. The legendary trio of homers? Need, speed, and greed. Bass, kakefu, and okada. Becoming desperate, he grows excited, then greed blinds him. Donguri soup is up. Donguri and greed sound similar? Not at all. Greed soup, huh? Adding 400 years to it makes a bowl into a valuable antique. I'll hit a walk-off home run. Making them makihara, the losing pitcher. What's up? Making it older. Seiji! What the hell? You should've knocked. Did you make it? There's still life in me. How is imari? She's fine. Then, it's okay. Give me some. "Reserved for the day" What? A deep breath. You don't need to do that, yocchan. Done. Done, okay. Hold it. The paper is crooked. Oh, yeah. - Right it. - This way? Up a bit, yes. It's fine now. It's not working, yocchan. The ink is running. The ink isn't right, no? Ah, the ink. Okay, hang on. This one was my great-great-grandma's. Go with it! Got a good feeling. - Stop! - What now! A deep breath. Come on. It is done. Alright, let me start. Keep quiet. Good. I feel great. 55,000 yen with 78. - Next, a tea bowl. - Please drop by. Excuse me. Please come by. 37,000 yen. 37,000 yen with 138. Next, a water container. 20,000 yen, 20,000 yen. Interested in incense burners? Well, kind of. I have something interesting that an amateur asked me to sell. A rikyu tea bowl. Oh, come now. Rikyu? Just before committing seppuku, he sent it to a doctor friend as a memento, or so I hear. It's with his letter. The provenance? From sakai. First market appearance? Here! 100,000! 100,000 yen, 100,000 yen. 500,000.00 500,000 yen, it jumped up wonderfully. His coat of arms... Here, 600,000! 600,000 yen, 600,000 yen. 800,000.00 800,000 yen, 800,000 yen. A million! A million yen, a million yen, a million yen. A million. A million with 108. That was great. Wore me out... I'm impressed, Mr. hiwatari. It was a good buy. Japanese treasures should be owned by Japanese. As well as rikyu bowls. Please come see for yourself. Sorry for the interruption. You're up early. The tea bowl... I thought you sold it. I sold the box. Told you, I'd have café au lait in it. I'm having some too. Café au lait doesn't suit yours. Why did you enter ceramics? You first. Well... My dick. What? It got hard. What? Why now? Not now. As a kid. You scared me. In fifth grade, on some vacant land around the house, I picked this up. My dad collected these. They were my textbooks. The forgery that hiwatari and tanahashi sold me was a red cylindrical bowl of koetsu's. It caused me to break a promise to imari to see the dolphin. And divorce my wife too. I'd always hoped to see the guy who made the forgery. Rather handsome, right? It's cold. Like this, like a v. Tsusen-in... Something's here. There's one in the seal too. Is it a mustache or what? It's a gull. Gull? I got drunk and this morning it was there. What did you do? What's a gull? Just be responsible for your role, okay? Your role. I'm risking my life! Your life? You've been sitting around! You two just... It's a bowl rikyu sent after hideyoshi ordered him to commit seppuku. It's a treasure with the manuscript and box. Tsusen-in. Wasn't rikyu supposed to have preferred red or black? So, is it rikyu's tea bowl? I heard a rumor. He's here. He's a curator, right? The other man is director-general of cultural properties. Who's that? Agency for cultural affairs. An official visiting an auction? So, does nationalism extend to art too? I live nearby. 10 minutes on foot. Once this rikyu is judged authentic, we will purchase it immediately. That incident with the sculptor unkei was bad. Unkei? Yes, some employee bought a Buddhist statue with his salary. It turned out to be an unkei. The country took no action and it was sold at a foreign auction. The hammer price including commission was about 1.4 billion. 1.4 billion! Why are you stumbling? We were lucky that time because it was bought by a Japanese client. But since then, they always come to auction venues particularly when an important cultural property is being sold. Introducing Japanese art to the world is also your job, is it not? No, no, no. What's your opinion, sir? Was the bowl sent to tsusen-in? Yes, zuisaku nakarai, known as tsusen-in. A doctor in favor with hideyoshi and familiar with the tea ceremony. This explains why the bowl has remained historically unknown. Not to incur hideyoshi's displeasure, he must've concealed getting the bowl. I agree with your interpretation. Like when the emperor gave nakarai medical books. And the nakarai family kept it secret. But... Rikyu's Potter chojiro died earlier than rikyu. That means the artist of this bowl was... The one with hands similar to chojiro's: Sokei Tanaka. More important than the Potter's name is the emotion rikyu infused into the bowl. What's this? What's this mean? The point... That convinced me was the gull. Gull! Gull? "Kanshinko" is a quotation from the son of sogyu tsuda. In the book, rikyu is called "gull." Of course, Mr. tanahashi, this is nothing new to you. "Buddhist layman rikyu entered a state of nonattachment" "in sakai, he faced the sea for days" "a white gull, seeing through his state of mind" "calls the man a true friend" the way rikyu lived was... Like a gull flying over the sea. But the closer he got to hideyoshi, the less he was able to soar. Committing seppuku, he was released from hideyoshi's spell. Rikyu must have felt that he could finally be the gull. Without a doubt, the gull was made by rikyu. The home the gull returns to is the bowl. A fiend for persistence, rikyu's regret... Would be caught by the bounding main. The very last tea bowl of his life... Would be the ocean that none could reach. How can you tell? It's written on the tea bowl. Can't you hear it? The Potter's ghastly cry while kneading the Clay to make the sea where one drop of rikyu's life, lost in Kyoto, may return. He bet his life on tea ceremony, and the green raku must be the state of rikyu's mind he wished united with the tea. Rikyu saw an eternal ocean within the tea itself. 4,000,000 yen. Plus 500,000. 5,000,000.00 plus 500,000. 6,000,000.00 7,000,000.00 10,000,000! Plus 2,000,000. 15,000,000.00 17,000,000.00 20,000,000! Plus 5,000,000. 30,000,000.00 40,000,000.00 50,000,000! 50,000,000.00 60,000,000.00 70,000,000.00 80,000,000! Yasuko. No one else? Is it done? I'm sure we'll get another bid. 80,000,000 won't do. Anybody else? No? Call it, then? It's a forgery. Y... you, don't talk nonsense. Thank you for showing me something interesting. But, the color just isn't right. The shallow bowl by chojiro. The one with the gourd design. It's true, blue glaze was used for it. But I've never seen nor heard of raku wares with blue glaze. Moreover, I question he would have an artist make a bowl that doesn't harmonize with the color of tea, before he died. Oh well. Gull... For now, I'll draw up a report and submit it to cultural affairs. Will it still be a cultural property? Well, that will require an agreement with the owner. I'll come if needed, thank you. Hey, wait, wait. Yes? When it gets designated, how much will the government pay? Well, we'll discuss it later. I'll pay the higher price. We won't give away our national treasures. First of all, why must we beg to borrow Japanese art for exhibitions in Japan? People call the Boston museum "ukiyo-e's shosoin," which makes shosoin in nara city cry! Hokusai and utamaro are crying too, as they miss Japan. Thanks, and sorry we couldn't give you a share, Pierre. [T's Charles, remember? Where are you from, actually? From the kansai area. What? Born in kawachinagano, raised in joroku, sakai city. Near the daiei supermarket. That's news to me. Shall I buy it for 30,0007? I'll buy it. Hey! They're coming back. Hey you! Hurry up. Hey you! - You okay? Hurry. - Yes, okay. Oh, hey... Look, from before... The bowl. Do you mind showing it to us again? Huh? Yes! You want to see it again? The tea bowl. Alright. It tickles. Here you are. Right, this is it. You were right, after all. "The ocean that none could reach." Yes. Rikyu's last bowl would have been this color. Without a doubt, this is the very bowl ordered by rikyu. Huh? What's going on? But you said it was a forgery earlier. We wanted to make a deal without the foreigner or the officer. Mr. kawauso, you're a real calculator. When Mr. tanahashi was playing dumb, you shouldn't have mentioned rikyu's gull episode. See? The white guy raised the price and... It doesn't matter now. I'm sorry. More important is that "green raku" is no good. In rikyu' time, they didn't call this color green. Blue raku. No... Jade raku. Impressive, sir. Jade raku. I feel you've touched the bowl's spirit. Both trying to outfox the other. What do you say to this? We packed 100 million, in a round number. - 100 milli... - 100 milli... Well, 100 million... Mr. kinuta, isn't it enough for you? With sales tax, I need eight million more. Eight million! Eight... eight... Too much, damn it. I'm taking two million out. Here, it's eight million. A pack of lies. Thanks! Here. The letter, and the box. Yes, confirmed. It's fine. Thanks. I... made a 100-million-yen tea bowl. They're gone. Amazing. It's heavy. Heavy? - Wanna try? - Yeah. It's heavy, really. - It is! - Right? It's scary! Be careful, prop her up! You too, try it. Heavy! Imari, be careful. Treat it gently. My turn, my turn. Whoa, heavier than I thought, yocchan. Wonderful! Mr. kinuta, you got eight million so cut it out. Heavy, heavy, heavy! Everyone, we did it. 100 million yen! Hooray! You may lift the veil. Now, no barrier exists between you two. Groom, you may now kiss the bride. Cheater! What? What's happening? What is it? A surprise, maybe? The entertainment. After you played with my heart. No. What? Come on... Run! Go! Run! Stop there! What's going on? Stop this woman! You asshole! Did you trick me? Hey, now, now. He's a playboy after all. Dad! Calm down! Are you his dad? No, not me! Your son has no manners! Hey, calm down! What is this? You thieving snake! What do you want? Stop, stop, it's dangerous. You're stabbing backwards? Run, imari! It's dangerous! Stop playing rough! Police! Police! You, wait! Why don't we three go see the dolphin? You know, the pink one that brings happiness. Well, I'm happy enough now. Who's your boyfriend now? I was against the marriage, but imari insisted on the dress. I'm pals with the dad, but that nerd son of his wasn't right for her. Done? Where are you going? Shouldn't you follow? Gonna follow him? Where are you... Hey! What are you doing? Are you nuts? Hey... give it to me. Dad. You're being lame again. Wait! Seiji, seiji! Hey, seiji! Delicious. Imari. Imari? Imari... Huh? Imari? No... The money was in the bag. Why were you carrying it? Can't go to the bank with the new national ID system watching. I know. - Right? - Really. What? Hey there. You, son of a... Idiot! Are you crazy? Go fake an accident on them! Seiji disappeared with the money. My daughter did too. Hit the gas! - What the hell? - Hit the gas! - To where? - Just drive. Hurry up! Hold up there! Imari, you go first! Why are you grinning? Seiji... he's become a man at last. It's no laughing matter. Let's make money again. We've got this. A spare "ocean." What? The ocean that none could reach. When did you... Mr. tanahashi's voice certificate. Would have been this color. What? You deleted it!? Sell your own tea bowls. It's more dignified that way. Even without waiting 400 years, it's an excellent bowl. Look. Gulls. "We make antiques!” Christie's is interested! After all, rikyu is strong. I wonder how it was done. What's wrong? No. We can't sell it. What are you talking about? It needs a scientific test. No, we can't do that. Your judgment is without question. No, no, humans... Often make mistakes. But, it could be over 1.4 billion! - 1.4 billion... - Yes. No good. If it's a fake, it'd humiliate Japan. Marco, when are you taking me to Italy? We're in Japan, let's visit Kyoto. Kyoto. Ok, ok, Kyoto... Kyushu? My horoscope says so. Alright. Let's sell bowls and soak in hot Springs. And eat kumamoto horsemeat. I'm in. But I can't do a kyushu accent. You just did. What else does kyushu have? Kyushu... nakasu street in fukuoka. Sounds great. If you like hot Springs. I said that. Anything else? - I don't know. - Come on! What else is there? Oh, kagoshima. That's a prefecture's name. Have you really been there before? Here. Imari! "English subtitles Norman england ayumi kageyama"
