[Instrumental music] [foghorn blaring] [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] [instrumental music] [foghorn blaring] [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] - Say, ah. Ah. - Ah. [indistinct chatter] [singing in foreign language] Right over there. Czechoslovakian. [speaking in foreign language] Now, he says that he went to a farming school in Brno. 'And he also want to go to school here.' Yes, I want to be a good American citizen. 'Uh, I also learned English at the American college in Prague' so that when I come to your America I can speak English very well. That's fine, Novak. Next. I can, uh, go now? Yeah, that desk over there, son. Thank you. Thank you, very much. Let me see your money, please. - Uh, money? - Yes. How much have you got there? Uh, $58, $8 more than I need. Uh-huh. Uh, can, uh, can I go now? Is there anyone in America who would be responsible for you? No. 'Or is there anybody at home' 'who could, uh, cable money to you?' No, I.. I have no people. Well, have you got a job to go to when you land? No, but I'll find one soon, perhaps tomorrow. Hold for special board of enquiry. Deportation to same port, Rotterdam, sailing tonight. [speaking in foreign language] You're sending me back? But why? You haven't got money enough. Why, all they told me at home I need are $50 I have, I have $58. Are you sure they didn't tell you $200? - Two hundred dollars? - 'It was 50.' But with so many families in want with labor conditions as they are the entry sum has been raised. I, I don't know what to say. Well, I tell you. You-you let me in and tomorrow I start to work. Very soon I can show you the money, perhaps in a week or two. Oh, uh, I, I don't speak very well English, you explain. I'm sorry, Karel, you'll have to go back. But, but I cannot do that. It took me a long time to save so much money to buy the ticket. I have no more ticket, so I cannot go back. We will pay your way back. Well... that is bad news. But if I have to go back, I have to go. All the way to Holland and then to Czechoslovakia. Also, I get so sick on the boat. - Well, it's too bad. - 'Alright. Joe.' Excuse me. You, you will take me back to Holland free? - It costs me nothing? - That's right. And you bring me back to America free too when I earn the $200? - Come on, you're holding up. - Excuse me. You bring me back to America? No. We can't do that. - Then, then I do not go back. - Take it easy, son. But, excuse me, for three years I've been saving money to come to America for my food and for my clothes. You don't know how I worked. I, I even learned English. Why, this has been my whole life to come to America, you cannot send me back now. It would take me years to earn enough money to come back. Please, you must find something. I'll do anything. - I, I'll work day and night. - Take it easy, son. Please, don't send me back. Let me earn the money here. - Next case. - You cannot do this. How am I to come back? Please, let me earn the money here. [dramatic music] [bell rings] [ship chugging] [dramatic music] [water splashing] [male #1] 'Grab him by the other arm. Are you alright, Mac?' [male #2] 'I'm alright, hoist him up.' [grunting] This guy's heavy. He must be full of water. Ah! He's croaked. No, he'll live. - He's coming through. - Let him sit up, he's alright. [coughing] [dramatic music] What's the matter, kid? You trying to commit suicide? No, I, I fell in. Thank you for pulling me out. - Thank you very much. - Hey, where you goin'? Can you imagine that guy? [male #3] 'We should've let that mug drown. - He's scared of something. - Hey, you dropped your wallet. Sir, that immigrant we were taking back is missing. - Have you searched the ship? - Yes, sir. He's not aboard. Well, he'll have a nice long swim. Now, wireless the immigration authorities, they'll pick him. Yes, sir. What'll it be, buddy? I would like to have some hot coffee and, uh, uh, this, huh. - Oh, rolls? - Yes. Couple of hot rolls, Tom. - Milk? - Yes. That'll be six cents. Hey, buddy, where you goin'? Here's your roll.

Move on.' [singing indistinct] Come on, girls. Let's rehearse the-- [indistinct chatter] [male #4] 'Hey, come on, girls. Let that food alone.' 'Let's get this number rehearsed.' 'Come on. Come one.' [upbeat music] Well. Wait a minute. Here. Well, take it. Go ahead and eat it. It's free. I'm staking you. You may as well sit down. When did you eat last? Uh, yesterday I think. 'Diet or necessity.' I beg your pardon. - Broke? - Broke? Stony, flat, cleaned out? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Oh, I get you. You're one of them foreigners who learnt to speak English but don't know it when you hear it. Oh, never mind. Skip it. Go ahead and eat. Here have another donut. - Where are you from? - Um, Czechoslovakia. Oh, is that so? Czechoslovakia. 'How do you like America?' America? Oh, she is wonderful. So beautiful, so big so friendly and so warm. Say, who are you talking about? Oh, America. Your country. - Are you in politics? - Oh, no. I, I'm a farmer. A fa.. Oh. Now, I know why you love us. The AAA has been paying you $14 an acre not to grow anything. Paying me not to grow anything? Never mind, skip that too. I beg your pardon, I, I wouldn't like to skip so much. Uh-huh, you won't. Have you been here long? Uh! Yes, um, long time. And still a farmer. You should've been able to starve to death in New York long before this. [music continues] Have you had enough? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. That's quite alright. Do you mind if I say something? Not at all. Well, I.. ...wanted to say that I.. ...I think that you're the love-loveliest young lady I've ever.. I mean, I wanted to say that a very beautiful.. I beg your pardon, my English. No, your English is swell. Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, uh, wait a minute. - Goodnight. - Oh, no, no, thank you. - Thank you. - What's the matter? Don't you think you'll ever be hungry again? Oh, I, I'll get a job. What? Doing farming? I'm a very good farmer. I went to farming school. Oh, I suppose you're going to start ploughing at 42nd street and sowing it with wild oats. Hello, anybody go to jail here? Hello, Murph. I thought I told you to move on. Is he bothering you? Oh, not a bit, he's alright. Oh, say, Murph, maybe you could help this fellow out. Oh, no. I tried that, he won't take it. But do you know of a job we could get him? Hmm. I don't know where I'd be looking first, Miss Dennis. Things are awful tough. I get tapped every day. I suppose you do. Well, I don't know anybody around here who needs a farmer except Murph here. - Do you understand farmin'? - Oh, yes, very much. 'Oh, don't get excited, he hasn't got a farm yet.' But he's gonna get one in Jersey when he retires. - Well, thanks anyway, Murph. - Okay. If I hear of anything, I'll let you know. So long. So long. Do you care what kind of work you do? Oh, I, I'll do anything. Of course, I wouldn't like very much to wash dishes. I did that for a week in a hotel in Prague and-- Well, I never went for that much myself. But my brother might be able to get you a job. Yes? Yes, why don't you come with me. Oh, uh, goodnight. Awfully glad to have met you. That's the landlady. Come up to apartment 4-C after she's gone in. - Come, Trixie, come. - Good evening, Mrs. Schultz. She's as deaf as a post. [knock on door] Does Mr. Frankie Dennis, live here by.. Hello, Sylvia. Hello, Frankie. Who are these ladies? I'm Miss Anthrop. This is Miss Evans. - How do you do? - How do you do? We came about Frank. Why, what's the matter? He hasn't been to school these past two days. Unless there is a very good reason. We shall have to take some action. Where have you been? Selling papers again? Yeah. Didn't you promise me you'd go to school and do that paper selling afterward? Yes, I did. And I'm sorry about that. Frank. Do you want them to take you away from me? Gosh, no. Well, they would you know, if you play hooky again. Why didn't you keep your word? 'Cause I'm sick of seeing you work so hard. Besides, I ought to be earning more. I'm getting too big to be sponging on you. Listen, Frank. Remember, what we said? I was to take care of you until you'd had your schooling. And then when you were older, you were gonna take care of me. - 'Isn't that what we agreed?' - Yeah. I don't want you to stay away from school again, promise? Uh, I promise. Honest, I do. He'll keep his word. He's a good boy. We had a long talk. You're pretty young, Miss Dennis to be looking after a small boy. Don't you think he'd be better off in Benton Institute? No. No, I don't. Best thing for us is, is to be together. I'm not so sure of that. [knock on door] Oh, it's you. Come in. I, I was afraid that I've lost you. The house is so big. Well, come in. Oh, uh, oh, this is a friend of mine. An old friend of mine, Mr.. What did you say your name was? Uh, Novak, Karel Novak. Uh, No.. Mr. Novak. - How do you do, Mr. Novak? - How do you do? We must be going. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Thank goodness they are gone. - Is anything the matter? Oh, no. No, it will be alright Oh, this is Frank. Karel Novak. Hello. What's the matter? Don't you like my apartment? Oh, yes. I, I was looking for your brother. Why, you just met him. This is my brother. [chuckles] I beg your pardon, I'm terribly sorry. You see, I thought because you said your brother could get me a job he would be a big man with a.. [chuckling] Like he owned a factory. Oh-ho-ho. No, no. No, he's a news boy. Oh, uh, Frank. Do you think you could get him started? Well, it depends. You got any dough. Well, uh, not just now, he's little short but things aren't going so well. - 'You know?' - Mm-hmm. Well, I thought maybe you could, uh take him in on credit. You mean as a partner? Yeah, well, he could work during the day while you're at school. Well, there is something in that. You could fix it with Goldberg. What do you think? Goldberg is the man who runs the stand. Well, I don't know about taking in strangers. You ever sold papers before? - No, I haven't. - What makes you think you can? Oh, well, I thought he could just to get started. Oh, I think I could, Mr. Frank. Is it very difficult? Well, at least he could try it out. Well... alright. If you are okay with my sister, you are okay with me. Thank you very much. I, I hope you won't be sorry. I hope I won't either. Well, uh, goodnight. Uh, I see you then, uh tomorrow morning, partner. - Goodnight. - So long. Oh, uh, where you going? - Well, um, where I live. - Where is that? I have a some, a little place where I sleep. Some cozy little alley, I suppose. You stay right where you are. Come on, now, get ready for bed. Ah-ha, don't forget the teeth. - Oh, gee. - Go on. Come on. - What's the matter? - This house is so elegant. You have carpets. Really? Yes and cockroaches too. Cockroaches. Isn't that wonderful. This looks like the best spot to me. 'What do you think?' I say, I think this is the best spot. 'What's the matter?' - This is it. - This is what? This is how it was in my dreams. Oh, it's wonderful. [inhales deeply] Smell the river? You take another deep breath like that and you'll poison yourself. - Look at those lights. - What lights? Those. They are gorgeous. And all those tall buildings. Oh, America. The way you say America it sounds like you thought it were heaven. It could be. Not my idea of heaven. Too much noise and dirt and worry about eating. Worry? Do they worry in America? Why sure, don't they worry in Czechoslovakia? Oh, yes, there, but here well, everybody looks so happy here. They all smile and look so rich and busy. We all try look rich and busy whether we are or not. But tell me, uh, why do they worry? Why not? We've had a depression. Everybody scrambling for enough to live on. To pay their rent, buy shoes for their kids. And pay their doctor bills. And maybe see a show occasionally. If most people grin it's because they don't dare not to. But the ones I've seen today they've got so much. Automobiles, good clothes beautiful houses to sleep in. And they're not hungry, they should be happy. There's more to life than eating and sleeping. Oh, yes, there is, but here in America there's the chance for everyone to get it. Here everybody can get ahead and climb to the height he dreams off. There's opportunity here. Are you out to get rich? Of course, I want to be a millionaire. That's what I came to America for. [chuckles] Well, do you think it's as easy as all that. Oh, I don't think it will be easy but that it can be done at all that's, that's grand. Do you know how many people want to come to this country of yours? For millions it is the land of dreams and hopes of achievement and happiness. - Do you really believe that? - Of course. But an hour ago you were almost starving to death. Oh, I already forgot all about it. Well, I guess this is the kind of a fellow I am. I remember always only the good things. Yeah, today was a little bit tough. I, I'm ashamed to admit it now but... this afternoon I was almost desperate. I didn't know what to do. Where to get something to eat or where to sleep. But that's America, something good always turns up. I have met you and you have helped me. Oh, I can't tell you what I feel. I will be grateful to you all my life and I pay you back. Oh, I will work hard. [sighs] I know everything will come out right. Sure it will. Unless a thunderstorm should come up during the night. And if it does you'll have to sleep in the hallway there. Well, goodnight. See you in the morning. Are you asleep? Well, if I was, I'm not now. Oh! I'm sorry. You know.. ...that guy is alright, I guess. Sure, he's alright. Oh, Frank. Did you ever stop to think what a wonderful place New York is? Sure. And we got the Giants and the Yanks. Babe Ruth hits home run in ten. Babe Ruth hits home run in 10th inning. Latest sports news. Wall Street closing. Oh, thank you, mister. Babe Ruth hits home run in ten. Babe Ruth hits home run in ten.. [whistling] [indistinct] [male #4] 'Get the finest sports news here.' 'Highlights and all Wall Street closing..' [indistinct muttering] Oh, stop it. - I might have known it was you. - Hi, Murph. Haven't I told you to stop bringing around vegetables? Did I tell your horse to take it? It's a fine way to bring up a police horse. - He's a crook. - 'Paperboy.' - Yes, sir. - And listen, greenhorn. You have to have a license to carry around vegetables. Alright, sue me, you big flat feet. Latest sports news. Babe Ruth hits another home run. Wall Street Final. Latest.. Paper, mister? Latest sports news. Ah, you're late. Extra. Babe Ruth hits another home run. Paper, mister. Thanks. Sure, I'm late. - Did you've to stay in? - Nope. Paper, mister? How about a paper, mister? Babe Ruth hits another home run. - Thanks. I got you fixed up. - Fine. - You start Tuesday night. - Paper, lady? What am I going to study? English composition, American history, spelling. Goodness knows you need spelling and algebra. Algebra? Do I have to know that? No, but I do and you can help me. Ha-ha. Read all about it. Babe Ruth hits another home run. Paper, mister? Say, that night school is out at 9 o'clock, what? - Yep. - Fine. Then I can still pick her up at 11 and bring her home. - Who Sylvia? - Yeah. Aw, she don't need you. She's got a million guys who can take her home. Well, certainly. Don't she ever talk about him? No, she never talks about him. That's funny, that just goes to show you what girls are. I know she's keen on a couple of 'em. Swell guys, college fellows. [male #5] 'This is the only one I can find that will sell for a nickel.' Well, that's alright, I'll take it. Do they have night college too? Well, yes and no. Don't let that worry you. I made it up. Made what up? About Sylvia and the million guys. - You did? - Of course. A million guys! I bet she hasn't even got a hundred. [honking] There was a fellow up to see her yesterday. Was there? Yep. Wanted the rent, didn't get it. Oh. [chuckles] So this man gave all us girls a $10 credit in his store and I added three bucks to that, bought this outfit. Which leaves me flat broke. I hope the show doesn't close. Gee, it looks swell. Wouldn't look so good on anybody else. Oh! How is it that you always manage to say the right thing, Karel? 'Cause he's a sissy. Oh, leave him alone, Frank. Maybe someday you'll get to be a gentlemen and think of something nice to say to somebody's sister. Look at him. Alright, go on, get sick and keep me up all night nursing your tummy ache. - Where is the salt? - Right ferninst the sugar bowl. Where did you get that ferninst stuff? - Why? I learn American. - From Murphy. That should be fun. Don't look now, but there's a fresh guy up at the counter who I think fancies himself a Clark Gable. I've been tryin' to spot that guy and I just got it. - Who? - That guy over there. Remember me telling you about fishing a guy out of the East River? - Yeah. - That's him. He's coming over. Now, watch this. I'm going to fry him to a crisp. Excuse me, fella. Don't I know you? [indistinct chatter] I don't think so. Didn't I fish you out of the East River? No, I.. I never fish in East River. You, you must make a mistake. I could've sworn it was you. Well, I guess, I'm wrong. Too bad. Yes, uh, too bad, goodbye. Not too bad for me. The fella that I thought you was dropped his wallet with 58 bucks in it. I was just going to give it back to him, that was all. 'So long.' He didn't even know you was in town. - Not was, were. - Well, okay, still good. He didn't even know you were in town. Say, if you'd been the guy, he thought you was, uh, were you would've got 58 smackers. 'Gee, that would have helped a lot towards that 200' 'you're so set on saving, wouldn't it?' What were you gonna do with that $200 when you got it, Karel? The day I've got it, I'll tell you all about it. Ha-ha. Bet, I know. You're saving up to get a diamond engagement ring. Frank! I wish it was, um, well, for that. Hi, Murph. What's the big idea of throwing your papers ferninst me horse? What's the big idea of putting your horse ferninst where I've to throw my papers? Wise guy. Now that you're a truck driver, you're a big shot. I never saw a truck driver who's different. 'One of these days I'm gonna give you a ticket.' And I give it right back to you. Say, Murph. You remember that, uh, foreigner I was telling you about? 'Which one?' Oh the one who is in this country illegally. Oh, that one, I hope you remember I told you it was your duty to turn him over to be deported. Yeah, that's what I wanted to ask you. Do you think that if they caught him before he had enough money to, uh, straighten the whole matter out that the friends he's staying with would get into some trouble? Certainly, they would if they knew he's in this country illegally. They'd be accessories before the fact or after the fact or something like that. But suppose they don't know he's in this country illegally? Well, I don't suppose you could put anybody in jail for having a criminal if they didn't know he was a criminal. - Is he really a criminal? - 'Of course, he is.' 'Just like you are.' You're in no parking zone. Now, come on, move out. - Move on. - Okay. [honking] [male #6] 'Business pretty good, Mr. Novak?' [Karel] 'Oh, yes, business is fine, thank you.' [Sylvia] I might've known it, every time I buy a new dress I have a short season. [female #1] 'Yeah, my old man is out of work too.' Sylvia! - Come quick. - What is it? Hurry, hurry. Now, uh, close your eyes, and-and, now, close your eyes. - Well, I.. - No, no, no. Don't. No opening, close your eyes. Don't look until I tell you, huh? Ready? 'Not yet.' I wish somebody would hand me a nickel. 'Now, you can look.' Oh, Karel, that is wonderful. [giggles] That's swell. Now I know what you wanted with that 200 you bought yourself a taxi. I didn't bought it. The taxi company hires me to drive. Say, I get a good salary and maybe if I drive slow with old ladies and fast with the young ones I make plenty of money from the passenger. Oh, that's fine. Well, you are getting on. Sure, I am. Want to see my license? Uh-huh. - 'Look.' - 'That's cute.' 'Isn't it? I grow to look to more American every day.' Don't you think so? Oh, I'm awfully happy for you, Karel. I wish I had some good news for you. Why, this is enough good news for one day. Mine's bad news. The show's closed. Well, that's fine, I'm glad. - You're glad? - Yes. Because now I'm the man of the house and not you. Now, listen, Sylvia, I make plenty of money Frank makes some money too, we get along fine and you have a rest from your dancing, huh? Aw, you're sweet, but I can't let you pay for things. Then, we're not friends after all? - Of course, we're friends. - Listen, Sylvia. Maybe you don't understand. A friend is for me somebody very dear. Very close, someone to give to makes me happy. Someone whom I work for gladly, whom I love.. I mean, um, uh, whom I feel friendly to. Someone you can count on. That's what I mean by being a friend. I know, Karel. - And you're a swell friend. - Well, alright. Don't let us talk anymore about who's the head of the house. Frank and I are head of the house we come home for dinner every night and complain about how you cook. - But I'm good cook. - Never mind. We're head of the house, we complain anyway. [male #6] 'Business not so good, Mr. Novak?' [Karel] 'Oh, yes, business is fine' 'but there is some little expenses this month.' 'I will make it up.' 'Uh, 65 cents, please.' - Keep it. - Oh, thank you, thank you. [tires screeching] [honking] Come on, get out, go home. - Go home. - Why? Strike! Leave your cab here and report to headquarters. Strike? Why, what for? I cannot leave my cab here. I do not understand. [whistling] Sylvia, what are you doing? - Washing. - Washing. Well, you can take it off just as good doing this as you can dancing. Well, maybe not in the same place. Say, what are you doing home so early? [stammering] Oh, Karel, you didn't lose your job? Job? I should say not. - Well, you're two hours early. - Well, I thought you see.. Um, I thought you were having such a dull time lately so I thought best I come home and bring you a little flower and ask you if you would like to go out tonight, huh? Oh, Karel, you didn't stop work just for that? Of course, I mean, you see I had to turn my car in. So I thought perhaps because I have not to work tonight we could go out and see a picture, huh? - Karel, you're a darling. - I should say I.. Say, listen, let me do it for you. - No. Go away. I need to work.. - Now, listen. If we are going out, you will have to change besides, I told you I don't want you to wash my clothes. And you're not such a good laundress either. Oh, I suppose you think you're better. Certainly I am. Now, let me do that, huh? Oh! You're supposed to rub the shirt, not the knuckles. Thanks for telling me, but it's a little late. You know, Karel, you're gonna make some girl a nice husband. Sure, I will, fellows like me are getting harder and harder to find. You know, if I hadn't promised to marry a millionaire I'd negotiate for you myself. Oh, you promised to marry a millionaire? - Yep. - 'Whom do you promise?' Myself. I thought so. Say, is this the only soap you've got? [Sylvia] 'Oh, no, there's another bar on the sink.' 'But go easy with it.' What do you think I went into show business for? I thought that you wanted to get famous. Oh, that was only one reason. The other was so I could contact some of those rich stage-door Johnnies that hand out diamond bracelets and orchids. - But, Sylvia.. - 'Yeah, I mean it.' No, a girl that would marry a man just for money.. Shows a good common sense and a healthy business instinct. Alright, alright. How many millionaires did you contact so far? - Sylvia. - Ah? 'How many millionaires did you contact so far?' - None. - 'Huh?' I never even got an orchid. Best I could do was to get a [indistinct] from a Kansas City undertaker. But I haven't given up. Maybe before you marry the millionaire you fall in love. [chuckles] Uh-uh, I'm fed up with poverty. I've seen too many girls married to men who are always losing their jobs. 'I've decided it's just as easy to marry' 'a rich man as a poor one.' 'Maybe easier.' Maybe, you're right. Huh? Maybe a good laundress like me contact a millionaire lady. [chuckles] - Why not? - 'Sure, why not.' - Would you, Karel? - 'Would I what?' - Marry, just for money? - If-if you would. Yeah, but it's different with a girl. Any man that would marry a rich girl just for her money.. Shows good common sense and a healthy business instinct. Well, maybe you're right. Why not? I tell you why not. Because the only millionaire you're going to marry is me. Why, Karel, you're turning caveman on me. Yes, sir. Well.. What about the millionaire now? Alright, now he's driving a taxi cab and he's got awfully wet hands. Oh. [chuckles] Well, sorry. Look what you've done.. Hey, where is everybody? - Are you on strike, Karel? - Who's on a strike? O-o-h, so, this is why you turned your car in? Well, what are we gonna to do? None of us earning anything. I am earning some. - We can eat anyway. - What about me? I've enough money in the bank to last half a dozen strike. Now, come on, let's have dinner and go to a picture show together, huh? I know, but should we spend that money? Why not? Aren't we both going to marry millionaires? - No kiddin'. - Yes. Why do you allow Miss Dennis to have the young man there? Huh? What kind of a house is this? Are you insinuating that my house is not respectable? - I'm asking you-- - Here, let me talk to her. Everybody in the house will hear you. Does Mr. Novak live in Miss Dennis' apartment or has he a room elsewhere? Huh? Read all about the game. Maybe you missed some of it. Paper. Thank you, sir. Paper. Read all about it. Here you are, lady. Thank you. Paper. Babe Ruth snatched the home run in the last inning. - Is that in the paper already? - No, sir. I saw it through the fence. Paper, paper. Read all about it. Read about the game. [intercom whistling] - Yeah? - 'Telephone, Miss Dennis?' Alright, thanks, I'll be right down. Telephone! - Maybe it's a job. - Oh, I hope so. Sure, it is. Hello, yes. Yes. This is Miss Dennis. Who? Yes. Alright. Right away. It's about Frank, a truant officer picked him up at polo grounds. Oh, I've got to go to him right away. Miss Dennis, how old are you? Twenty two. You're only 19. 'Aren't you?' Yes, sir. If there's anything I can do for you in a legal way Halsey J. Pander, attorney. Your brother isn't getting the proper upbringing, Miss Dennis. Oh, yes, he is, Your Honor. He-he's very healthy, he's never sick. It isn't just a question of his health. We have to think of his character. I understand Miss Dennis that a gentleman who is not related to you is living in your apartment. 'Is that true?' Oh, well, no sir. - Well, that is-- - 'Is it true or isn't it?' Well, Your Honor, Mr. Novak is in my apartment at times but-- Mr. Judge, that-that's me she's talking about. You see, I don't really live in her apartment. I sleep on the roof on blanket and when it rains so I sleep on the landing inside. I see, I understand the show in which you've been appearing is closed. Yes, sir. Well, how do you live without work? Well, Frank, earns a little and.. ...and Mr. Novak has been helping us out lately. I see, Mr. Novak contributes to your support. - Well.. - Yes, Mr. Judge. Let me explain, you see my, uh, contribution was in payment for a debt. Miss Dennis helped me out when I was without money and hungry. Well, I think it's only fair that I repay her now when she's out of work. I understand. Oh, Mr. Judge, Your Honor, there's no harm. There's nothing wrong in it, I swear to you. I believe you, young man. 'But I think you better reconcile yourself' 'to giving up your brother, Miss Dennis.' Why do I have to give him up? Because you're not able to give him the proper environment. Well, there's nothing wrong with me, Your Honor. I'm decent. 'I believe you are, Miss Dennis.' 'But you just haven't the home that your brother needs.' You're only a young girl. You'll be married someday, then you'll be able to get him back. I direct that the boy be placed in the Benton Institute. Well, does he have to got there tonight? No, not if you give me your word of honor to have him there tomorrow. - Oh, yes, Your Honor, I will. - That's all. Funny how all these things pile up. I bet I got things in these drawers that I ain't.. Haven't used in years. 'Though a way like this gives me a good chance to clean 'em out.' One, two, three. Three flannel shirts. One khaki shirt. And then whatever you call this stuff. And this one, the collar is torn. Oh, no, it isn't. You fixed it, Syl. Gee, thanks a lot. This khaki one though.. If I had a letter "B" I could sew on that'd be swell. Benton Institute. 'Or may be I need an "I" too'. "B.I." Gee, maybe it won't be such a hard place. Maybe it's one of those places 'where they lick you for nothing at all.' Oh, I don't think they'll lick you, even though I know a lotta kids who've been licked, that didn't kill 'em. Guess I can take it. Oh, Karel. 'Tell Goldberg to hold my spot for me, will you?' Ever seen them double deck beds, they got up there? Those double deck beds. The fellas sleep on up there. I bet they're pretty swell. Ah.. Guess I won't like it at that. I got a groove all wore out in this ole couch. 'Feels pretty good to me.' Maybe I wont be up there long enough to worry about their beds. Hm, one of these days you'll be getting married, Syl. 'Then I can come back, judge said.' Goin' up there will be just like a vacation. Out in the country.. [sobbing] Well, what struck him? 'Oh, don't cry, Syl.' There's nothing to cry about. Honest there isn't. [sobbing] Oh, it's you! Come on in. What're you doin' here this time of night? I want to ask you something. Oh, here, park yourself in this chair. Listen, I can stay only a minute. Sit down. What do you have to do to get married? Did you came all the way out to Brooklyn to ask me that? Now, don't, no kidding. What have you to do? - Well, first you get the girl. - Naturally. And then you get the best man, maybe a fellow like me to standup with you. And then you go to the Municipal Building for the license which is from a sour-faced fellow. Usually a bachelor or an old maid. - I don't know why, but-- - Do-do they ask you something? Sure. They ask you for two bucks. And I think it's a dirty shame. Two dollars and that's all? Ah, yes, I forgot something. The minute a fellow wants to get married they become suspicious of him right away. - Suspicious? - Yes. They ask you if there's any insanity in your family? Oh. [chuckling] I'm just kidding. I know it's severe. Congratulations. Poor unlucky girl. Well, she's not marryin' an Irish man anyway. No, worse lookin'. Now, listen. Let me see. There are $2. Then you have to go to the Municipal Building. Then, um, there's an old bachelor and.. Say, they don't ask you any question? No, all they want is your two bucks. Wonderful. I better go. I don't want to wake up your wife. My wife ain't here. She's visiting her folks in Canarsie. Then what are we whispering for? I don't know what you're whispering about but I have a sore throat. You big flat feet. Just for this, I won't let you be my best man. You big foreigner, you. Oh, hold on, wait a minute. That reminds me, I just thought of something. I think they'll ask you where you were born or so on. If I were you, I'd bring along naturalization papers with me. N-naturalization papers? Yeah, you never know. Some guys have gone long noses you know. Well, goodnight, me boy. Good luck to you. [Karel] 'I-I came to see you because, a friend of mine' 'he is in some trouble.' 'Um, you see, he came to America few months ago.' And they did not let him in because he didn't have enough money. You see, he thought they'd let him in for $50. But in the meantime the amount has been raised to $200. So they sent him back. But he, uh, that friend of mine he jumped off the ship and he is now in America. I wanted to know if you could fix it so that he could stay in America. You see, he, he likes America very much. Do you think you could make him a citizen please? - Have you any money? - 'Oh, yes.' 'You think you could do it?' It's a good thing you came in to see me. Uh, how much money have you? Oh, I have $6. Six dollars. Well, I'd like to take your case. But I'm not allowed to take a fee of less than $50. That's the law. Uh, you think, you could get $50? I don't know. Fifty dollars.. Well, you think it over, then come in to see me. And for $50 you could make me uh, I mean, that friend of mine a citizen? Why certainly. I can make you a citizen immediately. 'Good day.' Hello, Callahan? This is Pander. Yeah, I'm alright. I wanna ask you something? You remember that alien you located? Yeah, that sailor that jumped a ship. Did you get any money out of that? You did? A $100? Well, uh, who-who paid you? Oh, I see. The government finds the steamship people and then the steamship people paid you. Not bad. Yeah. Thanks, Callahan. Goodbye. Alright, go on get a cab. You can start at 1 o'clock. But remember this is at your own risk. - Thank you. - The same pay you had before. Mr. Harris, please could you do me a favor? 'What is it?' - Could you lend me $50? - 'What are you crazy?' We don't run our business like that. You want the job or don't you? Oh, I'll work a month for that $50. Don't do me any favors. Are you gonna start at 1 o'clock? Yes, sir. I'm telling you, Mr. Pander, I've got a job and I can give you the money in no time. Can't you do it on credit, please? Well, I don't make a practice of it. - But if you'll keep it quite.. - Oh, thank you very much. Um, how-how quick can you make me a citizen? Today? Oh, but I have to be a citizen right away. Well, you give me your name and address and I'll send the papers to you. N-O-V-A-K. Did you tell Karel we were gonna beat it? I haven't seen Karel. You don't suppose what I said last night about your getting married and me coming back.. You don't suppose he thought I was hinting at anything. He probably did. Men are conceited enough to think most anything. Hello. - Hi, Karel, where you been? - Hello. - Are you going somewhere? - I'm taking Frank away. I'm not gonna have him sent to any institution. - Oh, Sylvia, you can't do that. - Well, I'm going to. We're going to some other state where we can be happy. You would be running away from the law they put you into jail. When they catch us. But, Sylvia, you don't know what it is to be afraid of being caught. No matter how happy you would be always it would be in the back of your mind the thought that someday somebody might come up and say, "I know who you are". We'll change our name. I'll get a job in a factory. We're not criminals they're not gonna be sendin' cops out looking for us. But, listen, you would be afraid you could never be happy. I wouldn't be happier if Frank were in a orphan asylum. Now, Sylvia.. [alarm ringing] Frank, listen, could you do that in the kitchen? Sure. Sylvia, the judge said that Frank could come back to you when you got married. - So he did. - Sylvia, will you marry me? Thank you, Karel. Thank you very much. I appreciate your offering to help. It is not an offer to help. I'm asking you to marry me. I know, but I-I couldn't accept that kind of a marriage. Not even to keep Frank. - But you don't understand-- - Oh, don't I? Well, I understood perfectly well when you walked out of here last night. If I hadn't, I would have gotten the general idea when you tiptoed off to the roof so I couldn't hear you. How did you sleep up there without any blankets? I did not sleep. Sylvia, I had a reason for what I did last night. I ask you. Will you marry me? I told you, Karel.. If you don't like me enough.. I thought that.. I was so sure that you felt as I did. I can understand. I'm sorry I.. Sylvia! - You're crying. - No, I'm not. You.. Sylvia. So you do care. You love me. Well, what if I do? - Frank. - Frank. Karel and I-- Are gonna get married. I heard ya. Oh! Thank you, son of a gun. Did you listen? Sure. You're okay too. Put her there. I don't know which of you two is the luckiest. - I do. - Me, I suppose. Sure, now, listen, I've to go, I've got a job. - What kind of a job? - I'll tell you tonight. I'll be here at 11 o'clock I'll bring a bottle of wine and we celebrate. But I won't be here, I got to report to that institution-- Now, listen. Tomorrow when we get married. We go to the judge and explain to him why you didn't report. Everything will be alright. Come. Hotdog! [whistling] I wonder what Karel's working at. He'll be here any minute and tell us. Say, which goes on the right? The knife or fork? Knife. I hope it's nothing shady. You know, he acted kinda funny about it. Oh, Karel wouldn't do anything shady. Oh, Syl, what kind of a party is this gonna be? What do you have donuts for? You wouldn't understand about that, little man. Mr. Harris, I'm-I'm sorry about the cab. I'm insured. Are you hurt? Oh, no. I-I got away. Well, this fellow was got pretty mad because I took his job but.. Maybe they're right, but I have to have $50. Uh, I'll be back tomorrow if you don't care 'what happens to the cab.' Okay. [humming] Oh, gee, Syl. He'll be here in a minute. Why can't I have a piece? Nope. [knock on door] Oh. Ya big stay out, the door locked Ya being st.. - Miss Dennis? - Yes. - This your brother Frank? - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, miss, but my orders are to take the boy to the Benton Institution. Oh, but the judge said if, if I got married I could keep him and and I'm being married tomorrow. I don't know anything about that, miss. Get your things on, son. Oh, wait a minute. But it seems awfully foolish to take him there for just one night. 'I'm sorry, miss.' Oh! Hey. Is it too late to buy something? It's never too late to buy something if you've got the money. - You've got the money? - Sure. What can I do for you? You see, I'm-I'm getting married tomorrow. I'd like to have a small bottle of wine, but not too strong. Alright. Alright. This you can drink like milk. - How much is it? - A dollar and a half. But if you're gonna be married, you'll have plenty of expenses. Return the bottle and I'll refund you 20 cents. Thanks. Sylvia. Sylvia, you're waiting for me. How.. - Oh, Karel. - Sylvia, what is wrong? They've taken Frank to the institute. I tried to tell him we were going to be married tomorrow but.. Oh, Karel, what's happened to you? Okay, I got in a fight. It's nothing. I'll tell you about it later. So they took Frank away? - Oh, darling. - Oh, listen, it's nothing. Please don't cry. We'll have Frank back tomorrow the minute we're married. Oh, I wish we'd gotten married today. I know but you see it was impossible. The lawyer couldn't make me a citizen until tomorrow. Oh, what your being citizen gotta do with it? Oh, Sylvia. I've something to tell you. You see, I'm in this country illegally. I couldn't tell you before because if they caught me and you knew, you would have been in trouble for harboring me or, not reporting me. But this morning I went to see a lawyer and he says that he.. You see, the-the lawyer says he can fix everything for me. He'll make me a citizen by tomorrow and we get married, huh? Oh, well, I didn't know they could make you a citizen in 24 hours. Yes. - Are you sure? - Mr. Pander says so. I gave him my address and he's going to send me all the papers here tomorrow. - Oh, Karel, I don't know-- - No, no, no, now, come on. It's time for you to smile a little. After all tomorrow is your wedding day. [humming "Here Comes The Bride"] - 'Who did you say you want?' - 'Karel Novak.' [male #7] 'N-O-V-A-K. Novak.' Oh, my papers from Mr. Pander. He's got them already, you see everything is alright. Um, I'm Karel Novak. Have you got my papers? - Oh, you're Novak? - Yes. Well, you come with us, Mr. Novak. - Where? - Police Headquarters. Police Headquarters? What for? But aren't you from my lawyer, Mr. Pander? We're from the steamship company. Oh, look here, there must be some mistake. Well, if there's a mistake, we'll find out about it. Oh, Karel, don't go. Don't go, Karel. I'm afraid. Over there. Sergeant. A couple of customers. What's the charge? Holding for complainant. I expect him here any minute. Okay, boys. Oh, this is Mr. Pander, my lawyer. Mr. Pander, please tell this gentleman who I am. Show him my papers. Sergeant, keep this man in custody for tonight. - What's the charge? - Illegal entry, to be deported. The steamship people will send for him tomorrow. You mean the immigration department? No, the steamship company. - But, Mr. Pander. - Wait a minute, Karel. Say, what are you getting out of this? I'm turning this man in on his own confession. I told you to book him, sergeant. I don't know if we're supposed to hold anybody for a steamship company. Well, you just keep him here. I'll take the responsibility. Oh, must you? Can't we get another lawyer? Sure you can, miss. But I suppose I'll have to book him in the meantime. [male #8] 'What's your name?' Karel Novak. [male #8] 'Where do you live?' [Karel] '35, Barrell Street.' Hey, what are you two kids doing here? Oh, Murph. This man's making trouble, what are we gonna do? - Who's making trouble? - You keep out of this, officer. Say, when I want any advice out of you, I'll ask for it. What's he trying to do to you, Karel? He promised to make Karel a citizen. But now, he's turning him in to be deported. Oh. Did you give him any money? - No, I didn't, but I was to-- - Oh, now, just a minute-- Murphy, is this man a friend of your? - Yes, he is. - Well, now.. What's all that got to do with it? You're not trying this case, you're here to book him. Excuse me, if I say something. I don't deny what Mr. Pander says. I am entered this country illegally.. Really, sergeant, this is all beside the point. Mr. Sergeant, please, would you do something for me? You see, if I've to be deported, alright. But, this young lady and I, we wanted to get married. Could you make it so that we can get married tonight? Now? But you're going to be deported tomorrow. - I'll come back. - Wait a minute, son. Maybe you won't be able. Well, then, well, then I'll go to him. Why not, sergeant? Well, if they want to get married I-- Are you going to book this man or not? Say, fella, maybe this can be fixed up. Why not call the immigration people in the morning? Sure. Why don't you give him a break? He's not entitled to a break. He's here illegally. And I certainly don't understand where you get the authority to use your own discretion in this. I know the law. And I insist that it be carried out. I'm leaving this man in your custody. And unless you want to go back to pounding the pavements again he better be here tomorrow morning. What are we gonna do? What can we do? Say. Hey. [whispering] Joe, come on. [phone ringing] Hello. No, no, no, I can't issue a marriage license at this time of the night. Who? Oh, the Police Department. Alright, I'll be right over. [telephone ringing] Hello? Oh. Well, if you send the young couple around to my house in the morning, I should be more than happy to perform the marriage.. No, oh, no, it's quite impossible at this hour. No. Um? Ahem. The Police Department? Oh, yes, sergeant. [siren blaring] [tires screeching] Where's the fire, mister? I didn't know I was exceeding the speed limit, officer. I was only doing 20 miles an hour. The limit is ten. Well, those cars are doing more than ten. They're going faster than I was. - Is he drunk? - I don't know. - He looks like it. - Drunk? I haven't had to drink in a week. Get out. Say, who do you think you're talking to? I'll have you two fellows.. - Huh, he can't even walk. - Say, he tripped me. - Crazy drunk. - Hey, let go of me, I'm.. - Take it easy. - Let go of me. I can walk by myself. [male #9] 'That'll do.' Whoop. Drunker than a hoot owl. I don't see how he could get so drunk so quickly. - I am not drunk. - The line is here. - Keep your hands off me. - Resisting an officer? Resisting an officer. "Resisting an officer." I don't take anything from any punk copper. Boasting against the officers of the law? Bolshevist agitator. "Bolshevist agitator." Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do. Oh, Pete, before you went to the immigration department, you had a heart. - Will thou, Sylvia-- - 'Wait a minute, reverend.' Don't go too fast. This license gotta be finished before the marriage, you know. Did you say vaccinate? - 'Will thou, Sylvia, take--' - Just a minute, reverend. - What's the matter? - Vaccination. Vaccination? May I proceed? [male #10] 'Go ahead.' Will thou, Sylvia, take this man to be thy lawfully wedded husband? - I will. - It won't hurt. Yes, I know but suppose he has money enough to let him in? Two hundred and thirty dollars. Let me have that for a minute, will you? I.. Hey, I'll get you for this. Pete, he has more than enough. I have $230 in me hands. I can give you the number on the bills. Join hands and repeat after me. - I, Karel, take thee, Sylvia-- - 'Wait a minute, reverend.' Tsk, tsk, tsk. Where was your father born, miss? Uh, Niagara Falls. Join hands and repeat after me. I Karel, take thee, Sylvia.. I Karel, take thee, Sylvia.. [male #11] '...to my wedded wife.' ...to my wedded wife. Yeah, yes, they-they're being married right now. And they've got a boy, 11 years old. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I know, but the boy is her brother. To love and cherish till death do us apart-- [male #10] 'Where were you born, Novak?' Invantita Beach, Okrasberg Emazerich, Czechoslovakia. Europe. It's okay. Yes, he's vaccinated. And his tonsils are okay. And his teeth are all there. Sure he's got a job. Why, why, he's-he's, foreman of my farm in Jersey. Of course, I've got a farm. You'll remember this when you're back pounding the pavement in Canarsie. I hope I don't lose this key. You think it'll be alright, Pete? Ha-ha, thanks. Okay, reverend, heh, fire away. I pronounce that they are man and wife. Okay, Karel, I got everything all fixed up. [indistinct chatter] Congratulations, my boy. How about kissing the bride? [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music]
