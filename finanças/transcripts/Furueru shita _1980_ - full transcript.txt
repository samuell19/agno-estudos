"WRITHING TONGUE" Directed by Yoshitaro Nomura What's wrong, Masako? Go ahead. Eat. What's wrong? It's good. I cooked this gratin for you. Eat. Open your mouth. It's hot. You're pampered. Eat it yourself. Masako has a slight cold. The she must eat more. She couldn't open her mouth... at the hospital, either. The doctor seemed annoyed. Wasn't she examined carefully? Now, eat. Open your mouth. Open it. Eat. Masako, eat! You can, eh? You're too hard on her. Poor child! She's become neurotic. She just entered kindergarten. She's only one-fifth as big as you. To her, you look like a huge master. Masako can't endure the way... you order her around. I'm back. Come here. Look. What's wrong? You walked strangely. Your feet hurt? No! Show me. I wonder if... you've got a splinter. I'm all right. Then you can walk normally. Try. I can, but I don't want to. It's not polio, is it? Silly! Polio's like a cold at first. What did the doctor say? He didn't examine her very carefully, so... I'll go tomorrow. Please do. Let's try harder. What's that? How do you like it? Good. Your reward. Let's try hard. What happened? You all right? Get a chopstick! What for? Between her teeth! Open your mouth! Hurry! Put it in! Open it! Can't make it. Open your mouth! Call an ambulance! Send an ambulance. It is my daughter. It'll come soon. Our address is... Regular hospital? Saruta Hospital. Saruta Hospital. I got it. This way. We may have to remove your nails. You'd better send her to a big hospital. What's wrong? Seems something's wrong with... her brain. You mean - encephalitis or something? I don't know yet. You don't? You said it was a cold yesterday! He isn't the usual doctor. Is it all right if we leave her like this... today? We can't do anything here. Will you keep her here tonight? I'm afraid it won't make any difference. I'll be alone tonight. Take her home. She may have another fit... Then bring her here again. They won't take care of her... even one night? Don't blame that doctor. It's a private hospital. I'll bet he has a reason. Your own child is in trouble. How can you be so generous? You're being foolish. What a shame! I'll save her no matter what! Thank you for everything. Thank you. Goodbye. A university hospital. Won't they send us away again? They won't. Yamagishi introduced us to this hospital. She'll be hospitalized, then. What about her things? We can't tell yet. The health insurance card. They're raw. Does she bite her nails? It's her habit. Is her father very strict with her? That may be the reason. Is that true? Are you so hard on her? He scolds her terribly. Even adults couldn't endure it. Meningitis or cerebral tumor... Is there such a danger? I don't think so. No trouble with her eyes. A psychological reason. You see? I thought so. What shall we do? Keep bringing her here for a while. Show her to the professor tomorrow... to make sure. Thank you very much. At this late hour. Everything's all right, Masako. Take care of her. Pediatrics upstairs. Bend them. Breathe. Breathe deeply. Open your mouth by yourself. Open it widely. What's wrong? You can't I can. But I don't want to. Masako! Since when has she been like this? Several days ago. You saw? It's nothing psychological. Prepare a room for her. Dress her. Finished I'm afraid this is very bad, Mr. Miyoshi. You must be fully prepared. Of course we'll do all we can, too. Is it that bad? It's not definite yet. But serious diseases can be suspected. What are they? Go to the X-ray Section. See to this I can't be certain until I examine her... thoroughly. But - tell me. What could it be? X-ray photos. How is she? I don't know yet. What did the doctor say? Meningitis or tetanus. Kunie! Hold on. Look this way. Don't move your head. Keep your eyes closed. Almost through. An emergency case. Examine her. Wait in the corridor. Look straight ahead. Don't worry. We'll be finished. Won't be long. Please enter. Wait here. She's Dr. Nose I'll take care of your daughter. Eda, her assistant. We've diagnosed it as a case of... tetanus. No suspicion of cerebral tumor or... meningitis? No. What method of treatment? Absolute rest is required. Avoid all stimuli that might cause... convulsions. Then anti-toxic serum treatment. The sooner we inject the serum, the better. We've ordered the serum already. We'll move her to pediatrics. Mr. Miyoshi. This way. Please be seated. About tetanus. It has no aftereffects. So it may not look very serious. But it has a very high death rate. Only one out of 20,000 suffers from it. It's not been explained completely. The bacilli got into your daughter... through an injury. They have increased, releasing... a terrible toxin. The serum can overcome the bacilli. But it has almost no power over... the toxin. Masako has had convulsions already. That's bad. Here. Your daughter. The head nurse I'm Saito. I'll help you I'll undress her. Do it quietly. Someone was in this bed I'm sure. Was he saved? Or did he die? He was saved. And he was sent away from this room... for us. That's it. What did the professor say? He just told us to be careful. Masako is very ill. Yes? Yamagishi. Tetanus? How is she? The treatment hasn't started yet. Thanks for your help. Anything else I can do for you? What about money? I told our accountant to pay you quickly. Thank you. Here's some money. Use it. Now, Masako. You'll be all right. You're brave and strong. Very strong, aren't you? Hold her legs. Don't be afraid. Did it hurt? I'm sorry. We're almost through. It doesn't hurt any more? Masako. You want to get better, don't you? Be brave. Mind the needle doesn't slip out now. Put in the serum. She'll be all right? She's out of danger, isn't she? It's festered already. Why so fast? She bit it just last night. Probably because you haven't slept well. Listen, is it possible that I'll get tetanus, too? Doesn't her saliva carry the germs? I don't think so. It's written in here. Tetanus bacilli are anaerobic. They dislike oxygen. Saliva can't carry them. But we'd best be careful anyway. A preventive injection? Yes. I'll talk to the internal department. Direct causes of death: Suffocation by... Paralysis of breathing muscles. Heart attack. Pneumonia. Sometimes violent convulsions... break the patient's backbone. The death rate is very high. It ranks at the top, by far exceeding... Japanese encephalitis. Incubation period and death rate: If less than 5 days: 100% Less than 10 days: 79% More than that period: 38% How many days since she got ill? 5 or 6 days since she stopped... opening her mouth. What happened? They removed my nails. Looks like felon. Won't I get tetanus too? They're raw. They get wet with her saliva. Saliva never carries bacilli. But you'd better get... a preventive injection. It doesn't work so fast, though. Here! Masako, what happened? I bit my tongue! I bit it again! What'll we do? Be quiet! We gave her a shot. So why? Is Dr. Nose there? What happened? Send her here! DON'T MAKE A NOISE. BE QUIET. 9:30 P.M. DON'T MAKE A NOISE. BE QUIET. NO VISITORS ALLOWED Did the germs enter there? Probably. The bacilli release toxin... which causes the convulsions. How can the bacilli live? They dislike oxygen, don't they? Existing from the time when... there was no oxygen on earth. They've been hiding somewhere. In the water, in the mud. In the intestines. They enter through wounds, and... start their action. All finished. Bandage her. A critical period of about a week. She may get worse temporarily... after the start of the serum treatment. Be very careful. She's already seriously ill. Stay with her throughout. We understand. We'll do our best, too. Even a small stimulus can cause... convulsions. So be careful. They're very strict. Go home and rest. We're going to... have a real hard time. How can I go home? What about you? Can you? TWO DAYS AFTER BEING... HOSPITALIZED 7 A.M. All right? Don't spill it. Masako. How are you? You haven't eaten, have you? You're going to eat this today. Hold her head. Be a good girl. Take it. We won't be long. Now, swallow hard. Finished. It's over. Be a good girl. Stay still. Now it's going to get in. How is it? Did the Pediatrics do this? It's hard for you, isn't it? I think I still have a fever. You'll never get tetanus even if... she bit you. Don't worry 1:30 P.M. Will these do? That one, too. A toothbrush and toothpaste. Will you help me? I bought pajamas for her. Take it slowly. She sweated last night. Bled too. Do it slowly. Hold her! Doctor! What happened? Convulsions! Doctors! Convulsions again. Don't worry. The doctor's coming. Help me. Open your mouth. She wet herself. Needs changing. Convulsions sometimes cause that. They sell diapers at the shop. She'll have convulsions many times. Don't get upset. But no stimulations! 6 P.M. 8 P.M. 10 P.M. Injections can't stop her convulsions. Rectum anesthesia. She may vomit. Empty her stomach first. It works so fast. You watch. She's become worse. Her condition is hard to describe I hope she won't become even worse. The medicine will work for tonight. Doctor. Will you stay here tonight? I mean... We'll feel easier then. I'll stay. I'll sleep in the treatment room. What are you doing? Recording it. Recording it? So that we can tell... how and how many times... she had convulsions. Good idea. But you'd better go to sleep. I can't. Don't mind me. You rest. So you can take my place. If you get sick, what'll happen to her? Just go to bed. She's become worse. Her condition is hard to describe. Don't touch the mud! Masako, don't touch the mud! It's very dangerous! Stop it! Wash your hands! Stop it and wash up! Masako! Wash up! Do as I say! Wash your hands! Masako! 3 A.M. Where were you? I was calling my mother. At this hour? I asked for money. My sister will bring it tomorrow... by the bullet train. You should have awakened me. It's starting again. Medicine's run out. She bites her tongue every 30 minutes. Convulsions of her lips and jaws. She bit her tongue. Rest a little. I'll take your place. The burn is gone I'm glad. She won't hold it against me. You must go to bed. Why don't we three go see... Lake Towada? In autumn. I've found her a good medicine for... seasickness. Let's go. Promise I promise. The three of us together. We'll go 3RD DAY 1 P.M. Dr. Nose, please! What happened? It's my daughter! Pull yourself together! Dr. Nose? Where is she? Seeing outpatients. My daughter's having convulsions. Please! Lift her head. Open your mouth! Dr. Nose! It's urgent! Milk teeth or permanent ones? Milk teeth, eh? She'll soon have new ones. Good. Dilator! We'll anesthetize her. Anesthetic injection. Do you mind? Sorry. I'll do it. Suck it out. There's a tooth left on the tongue. What happened? What's wrong? Seems there's no chance. Masako may die. It's so cruel it's too much. Mr. Miyoshi I guess you saw how she was. Convulsions can cause suffocation... or pneumonia. Can we do tracheotomy? Cut open her windpipe? Yes. Must you do that? It'll help her breathe more easily. If it's necessary, please do it. How is Masako? I know it's hard for you, but don't give up. Some money. Tell me whatever you want me to do... for you. Thank you. What're you doing? Sorry, it's called off. Called off? Prof. Nohara says further stimulus... will make her worse I see. Then... What then? An oxygen tent. Why not earlier? What more are you going to do? Your family is at the reception desk. Will you leave us alone? Let's go meet them. You go by yourself. Why? Never mind. Just go meet them. All right, then. Change of clothing. No visitors allowed? How is it going? They're doing their best. Don't worry. It's such a big hospital. Kunie's tired out. I'll watch Masako this evening. I'm here for that. Not necessary. Your coming here... is enough. Why shouldn't I? Masako's my granddaughter. All we can do is watch, so... I'll stay here anyway. Let her do as she pleases. She never takes back what she says I'm not just stubborn. When it's so hard on you and Masako... how can I just sit and wait? I feel sorry for you. You've got white hair. She's Kunie's sister. What's that? What's happened? An oxygen tent. The amount of oxygen is fixed. Don't touch it. Does this mean that... the end has come? No. It's just to help her breathe... more easily. But... She isn't getting better at all. She's becoming worse. Look at her mouth. It's odd. Masako! Masako! Stop it. She can't talk. She can't even talk? 9 P.M. The aspirator. Doctor. No hope? She's going to die, isn't she? No, she's not. But, she's put in this tent. Don't weaken now. We're doing all we can do to help her... live. That's enough! You're only fooling me! Stop it! You were fooling me, too. You never told me this would happen. Masako shouldn't have been born I shouldn't have even married you. Her diaper is wet. We put the pipe as far as her lung. She can't talk I want you to be careful. Please take the used diapers... to the toilet. And put them in the bucket... with her name written on it. Kunie - you're tired. You haven't eaten or slept. I'll go buy some food. Change her diaper first. No. You do it. Why so hesitant? You're afraid you might get tetanus too? That's why you always make me do it. What are you saying? 11 P.M. Mother! Mother. Oh, it's you? Why didn't you go home? I wanted to stay. How's Masako? Let's go to her room. No use. I can't do a thing for her. Just staying here is enough. Mosquitoes will bite you I don't care. They don't bite old people. Go back to Masako. Don't say that. Come on. Kunie, it's mother. She stayed on for us. I bought some sushi. Eat them. Record it accurately. Doctor! Please! This is enough! Don't do anything more! Don't! No more! No more! Stop it! Don't do anything more! Stop! Stop it! 2 A.M. No! No! It's not tympanitis! My blood is... filled with poison! An injection. Be brave. I don't like red injections! Everything will become red! No! No! Wake up. You were having a bad dream? I was dreaming of the time... I suffered from blood poisoning. You were narrowly saved at that time. 4 TH DAY 8 A.M. Don't worry. She's such a nice girl. I have a hunch she'll be saved. Mother, let's go. The same thing is repeated. It happens to be your turn. Goodbye. We'll come again. Take care of yourselves. Phone me. 1 P.M. 11 P.M. Can't measure her blood pressure. It's reacting! 4 A.M. Kunie! Listen very carefully. Masako will die I'm positive. So when morning comes, go home. Fix up the rooms. And - Savings books. Seals. Put those important things in order. So everyone can find them easily. And - Because my finger is hurt. I may fall ill, too. So - Fix up the rooms. Sleep there I'll call you if it's necessary. Understand? Yes. Then, go. If you die - If an innocent girl like you... must suffer this much and die... I'll love only you. Only you I'll have no more children. I'll keep loving only you. I can't save you after all. So that'll be the only thing I can do... for you. Mrs. Yamagishi? It's me. Will you go to my apartment? My wife sounded odd. She went home and just phoned me. Please. 5 P.M. All right? How is she? My wife and I brought Kunie here. How is she? She's worn out. Get her a doctor. Sorry to bother you. At a time like this! She says she has something for you. Go see her. I'll watch Masako. If anything happens... I got it. What's wrong with you? I've brought it. This one. I can relax now. I feel good. What's this? What else? Saving books and policies. And - This one. Masako and mine. Now you're the one to hold on. I got the disease from her. There's a definite symptom. The same as Masako. No! Better see the doctor first. I'll call you soon. Sit down and wait. I'll go tell my husband. I couldn't do anything for you. I couldn't do anything. Except having children. So I had one. But it has become meaningless. I'm sorry for you. Forgive me. I'm no exception. The three of us may all die. It's odd - our life. It's so fragile. Come in. I see no symptoms for now. Got an injection? Yes, both of us. Nothing more to do. Don't we have to have a second... injections? Yes. The first one is just preparatory. But I don't think you're infected. Really? I heard they were telling... a boy to keep away from my daughter. I think that was just in case. It's unthinkable that you're infected. I see. One more question. 25 years ago when I suffered from... diphtheria. I had a horse serum injection. You can't use it twice, can you? We use human serum for tetanus. No problem. You have a symptom? What did the doctor say? That I'm tired. He's right. Something's really wrong. Tetanus is so rare that... doctors can't be definite... until it's for sure. You just think so. Don't be weak hearted. Don't give up! I'll let my wife stay at your place. Why don't you go home and sleep? Let's go. That's the best. Then I will. I'll come again tomorrow. It's real hard on you, isn't it? Shall we go? Don't you want to see Masako? I do. What's wrong? What happened? I'm scared. I can't go in. I want to see her, but I can't walk. Better send her home right now. Shall we go now? Let's go. We're both all right... for now. Glad to hear that. You must hold on a little longer. It's not easy. But you've almost done it. I wish the intervals... between convulsions were longer. I'm sure she's too tired. She couldn't sleep. But she fell asleep just now. I'm sorry for all the trouble. The same record. She plays it over and over again. It drives me almost crazy. She's asleep now. If anything happens, I'll call you. Please tell her in the morning... not to worry. Why do you torture her? If you found the old earth in Masako... why don't you live quietly? Aren't you trying to live, too? So are we. Why the toxin? To prove you're alive? If Masako dies, you'll die too. You'll be exterminated. Don't you know that? Hurry! Anything can happen. It's unpredictable. Watch her carefully. Who else could do it? You said you'd come today, didn't you? But - I'm afraid I feel weak at the knees. What'll happen to me? Don't you mind if I get worn out? I do mind. So I'm trying, too. But I can't open the door I'm much weaker than you - body and nerves. I'm completely exhausted. All right! Don't come. MIDNIGHT 5 A.M. It didn't have to be today. You talked so roughly I had to come. How's your jaws? They still feel odd. But I can open my mouth. I couldn't if I'm ill. Isn't that right? Probably. Mine are still numb. You were scared when you came in? Yes. I was very scared when I opened... the door. Starting today, one of us will rest... at home... while the other one is with her. No. What if something happens... when I'm alone? No. If either one of us falls ill. Masako will die. I'll stay here at night, you in the daytime. Okay? All right. 2 weeks after hospitalization Awful sound again? When we've come this far... I'm scared! I'm so scared! I'm afraid. What's wrong? What're you afraid of? I'm afraid. Aren't you scared? Don't worry now. The awful things are gone. I want to eat. I want to eat a chocolate bun. A chocolate bun! I want to eat a chocolate bun I want a chocolate bun. Why? You never liked chocolate buns. A chocolate bun! I want a chocolate bun! No buns yet. You're going to have soup. A chocolate bun! What shall I give you? Some fruit juice then. When Masako first talked... I realized I didn't understand... how she suffered. Masako was the only one... who contracted tetanus, endured it and fought it through. Poor child! She still had to... suffer from a high fever caused by... the serum. But Masako was getting better. Dr. Nose looked relieved. No signs of complications. Dr. Nose was so kind to Masako. Kunie might have become jealous. I'm scared! Masako was still very afraid of noises. Don't be afraid. ONE MONTH AFTER HOSPITALIZATION She's being transferred to a big room. You're going to sleep alone from today. All right? I'll buy you some comic books. Why, thank you. Nice, isn't it? Thank you very much. This time she said she wanted... potato chips, not buns. I'm really glad for you. I'm so grateful. I don't know how to thank you. Doctor, Prof. Nohara wants you. It's raining, isn't it? It's stopped. Yes, it has. Well then, goodbye. Shall we eat something? Yes. Dr. Nose likes eels. She always eats them for supper. She's nice. Is she single? You were so difficult. I don't remember. Silly! Want eels? Sure! What eels? The best ones. I see. All the children in the room are... sound asleep? She's all right then? Thank you very much. Good night. Masako is sleeping peacefully. The TV didn't disturb her.
