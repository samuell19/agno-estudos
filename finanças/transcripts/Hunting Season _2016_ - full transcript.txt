Mr. Harris. Hi, hi, it's Ian from J&J Brokerage Firm. Yeah, yeah, how you doing? Oh, me? I'm great, Man. I can't complain, Man. So, um, we're just here looking at the numbers. Did you see 'em? Uh-uh, you see? I told you they would go up. I know, I know it was your wife's call. That's okay, but look how much that call cost you. What if I was to tell you I had another one? Would you jump on it? I swear, Man, the exact same thing. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. My Man! Ten? Aw! Okay, Mr. Harris. Hey, you the Man! No, no, no, you the Man! Okay, all right. I'll talk to you soon. What are you so happy about? Hey, Man, I got the Harrison Account! Yeah? Yeah, Man. How much? Ten. Ten? No shit! That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Shit, Man. Thank you, thank you. Hey, buy a new suit. Aw, come on, Man. I just got the Harrison Account! Right. Yeah, yeah. You know I'm trying to make all that money. Right. Yeah, nah. Not busy. Okay, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do that. Make sure the numbers are right. Okay. What's happening, Ro? Hey, Tony. Uh, the new kid, Ian? He's doing very well. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Hey, you know, it's been a long time since we had a promotion. Yeah, it's been kind of a tough year for these candidates, Man. Now as you know, there's a lot of money to be made, so we need to make it. We need to put it in my hands, okay? So what do you think, you wanna take him to Nick? That's exactly what I want you to do. I thought you said he's an ass kisser. He's a moneymaker. He can kiss ass all he wants. Kiss your ass if he wants to. As long as he's putting money in my hands, you feel me? Are you sure? Goddammit, Tony, is that what I said? You're always questioning me. You will never be me, do you understand? 'Cause I don't kiss ass. That's all right. I'm not gonna be you. I don't kiss ass. Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony. Do you want to work here? 'Cause we could step outside, I will fuck you up, all right? Yeah. Go to Nick. But before you go, remember I will fuck you up. Get the fuck outta my office. This motherfucker has lost his motherfucking mind. Hey, Ian. What's up? Tony wants to see you. Did he say what about? No. You know I got the Harris Account earlier, so, uh, I don't know. Might want me to make partner or something, you know? Yeah, we gotta get going. Oh, right this moment? Right now. Oh, okay. Listen, the higher-ups wanna see you. I put in a good word for you. It looks like some things are happening. Uh, Bro, Man, I can't.. Man, this is awesome! Ian... Don't make me look bad, all right? There's an opportunity to make a lot of money. You like money, right? No, I don't like money. Look, I love money, okay? Dude, my gratitude for this.. I don't know what to say. Just go get yourself ready, go fix your tie. We'll go meet them in the conference room, all right? So, Nicky, when are we gonna go somewhere and do something? I'm bored. I'm going on a retreat with some of my associates very soon. I'm gonna take you with me. I meant to tell you that. Really? So we're really gonna go somewhere this time? Really, yeah. You're not afraid of anybody seeing us? I'm not worried about anything. You're with me now, okay? Hmm. Well, you know, this is your business, and... All these people work for you. That was before. You're with me now. It's cool now, all right? Great. So I need to go shopping. Let me get some money here. Here, is that enough? This will do just fine. So how am I gonna get to the mall? I'll get you a car. I can drive myself. You wanna drive, really? I do. Uh-huh. I need you alive, okay? I'm gonna get you a car, okay? Oh, that's for the car? Wow. Here. That's a couple cars. Or you could maybe take the bus and buy two outfits. I'm kidding. Huh? Ain't got any other choice. You like him? You like him? Yeah. Ian, we've been watching you, and, um, you've been doing some good work. Amazing work, actually. Wouldn't you say? Yeah, we've been very impressed. Thank you, Sir. That means a lot to me. Um, the fellas and I have been working here in this firm together for, oh, just some time now. To start a successful business, a very successful business, you need many things. There's intangibles, et cetera. But every enterprise, big enterprise, has one thing in common, one common denominator, and that is teamwork. What do you think, Ian, would you agree with that? Yes, of course. Yes, Sir. I agree with everything you just said, 100%. As a matter of fact, I agree with everything you said, 110%. You can't do anything 110%. You can only do 100%. And I want your best 100%, okay? So where was I? Company, teamwork, um, how do you make a lot of money. I was talking about money, I'm always talking about money, actually. Money or pussy. So how do you make a lot of money? How do we make a lot of money, more to the point. How do we make a lot of money? Company picnics, right? Did he say that? That's nice shit, Ian. What did he say? He said picnics. He talking about black people? Yeah. He's black. Ian, come on. But picnics? Hang on a second, Ian. Did you say picnics, really? Fuck you, you did not. We take the gloves off in here. This is how we are upstairs. Okay, you assholes downstairs gotta work. We're up here kicking it and counting money. We take the gloves off up here, Baby. Where are all the bitches? Oh, I'm just joking. Anyway... What do you think these persons are doing Friday night? I'll tell you. Bonding! Bonding. I was gonna say bonding. Teamwork! How do you become a team? You bond. You see all these great teams in the 80's, the 70's, 70's. Teamwork! Lew Alcindor, then Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Greg Lee, Marques Johnson, Walt Hazzard, Gail Goodrich. John Wooden was the key. He made them play as a team! The Bulls! They had Michael. You gotta have a go-to guy to win a championship, but they were a team! Steve Kerr won a championship, so did Jim Paxson. The team. Michael Jordan doesn't win anything without a team. Mike wasn't shit until Scottie Pippen. Scottie? Shut up. I said that already. Everybody's integral to the teammates. You're right, Nick. I see what you're doing. Okay, Man, go ahead. We're gonna pause now. We're gonna pause now. You wanna pause? Yeah. One of our partners here thinks you're a bit nervous. Do you feel a bit nervous? No, Sir, not at all. It's okay. Listen, honesty is.. Real men aren't afraid of the truth. No, no, I'm.. Hit a deer before, you know. I just ran him smooth over. No. Nervous in this interview. No, no, not at all. Not at all, not nervous at all. I'm not sure if you're nervous or an ass kisser or a nervous ass kisser. But one thing I do know is you're willing to learn. If you want to play hard and learn... And listen, you can get better, you can improve. We're not the NBA. You gotta be great. You got to have gifts. In business, you can learn. We fuck people up. We want our competitors to go home and cry. We want to destroy their will, go home and not feel like you're big. I just lost $200 million. That would fuck me up. Bottom line, Ian, are you in? Me? You guys want to invite me? It's the next phase. Yes, of course! Well, then come down here and shake our hands. Yeah! Thank you, Guys. I appreciate it. You know, I'd stand up, but I'm kind of ashamed I have on jeans. I did this interview with you.. Oh, whatever. I'll get up. Hey, you do whatever you want, Sir. Come here. Thank you. ♪ In a fastback Mustang, Man ♪ I gotta say it's a real sweet ride ♪ ♪ With a red-hot Betty ♪ Sittin' right here at my side ♪ I'm about to go outside and have a smoke.

Okay, okay. I love you. I love you. Try not to get into a fistfight with him. No promises. Hey, I found a pattern between the three missing people in the last two years. It's a small one, but it could be something. They all played penny stocks over at J&J. Do you want me to call over, see if they know anything? No, I got it. J&J Financial. This is Ian. How may I help you? Hey. Yeah, listen, um, something came up from work, and I was wondering if you could check out some names for me. I'm not really sure if I'm supposed to. What's this about? Yeah, we found a connection between a missing, and we just want to see if there's any more information. All right, go ahead and give me the names. Oh, yeah we got a... Debra Fields, Anthony Jefferies and Julie... Garin. Garin. Okay. All right. I have them all written down. I'll go ahead and pass these to my higher-ups. Okay, thanks. Yeah, it's the best I can do without breaking the law or without a warrant or anything. Listen, I really want to help, I do, but I just don't want to get in trouble. Um, have you talked to Mom lately? Kinda really busy right now. You know, clients and all. You understand right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Me too, me too. Yeah, take it easy. We gotta go. Shit. Ballsy motherfucker, huh? Look, he doesn't have a warrant, okay? And he really will never, ever talk to me again and go forward with this. Look, if he does call back, just let me know. I mean, they're all small time losers paid by money order or whatnot. So there's no trail. Don't even worry about it. So we're good? Yeah. Beautiful. It's all good, Man. Eddie! Hey, Matteo. Steady Eddie. Man! Come here. Hey, Man. Yeah. That was.. Whew! You... We got lucky. Hey, I don't know, Man. That was all you right there. I was just doing my job. It was. We got lucky. We got lucky. Nah, bro, that's all you right there. That's all you! You're welcome. You're welcome. We got lucky. We can't expect that kind of turnaround. But we got it, so we're going to use it. We're gonna go long term, and we're gonna put some money right back into your pocket, all right? And then I'm gonna take the bulk of it, I'm gonna reinvest it. Listen, we made a lot of money last time. All right? A lot. So whatever it is you want me to do, I'm in. Just tell me what you need me to do, and we're in. This is what I needed from you. I needed the face to face. Now I go back in, and I take care of all of it. I just needed the okay from you. So, hate to cut it short, but daddy duty calls. Before I go, you want anything to eat? Coffee? I'm good. You sure? I already drank. You sure? Yeah. All right, My Man. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I'll see you next time. Say hi! Say hi. Hi. Hey. See you later. That's Daddy's friend right there. Best friend. I'll do my best. I'll do my best. It happened last night. He's with the sketch artist right now. I'm Special Agent Collins, and this is Special Agent McBride. We're with the FBI, Missing Persons. We'd like to talk to you about what happened. Now? Just about done. That's him! That's the motherfucker that jumped me! He jumped me from behind! Okay, Mr. Monroe, you wanna start from the top, tell me what happened? Well, I was leaving work. And then I lit me a cigarette. I started my car first, and I lit a cigarette. And I heard a noise over by the garbage cans, and I walked over to see what was going on. But I didn't see anything. So as I turned around, he jumped me from behind! I got a copyright match on the tattoos. It's an artist from Fuentes County. I want you to get in touch with the local sheriff's department, let them know we're on our way. What is it, a six-hour drive? Four and a half. You did good, Mr. Monroe. This is a big break in our investigation. You did real good, Man. Real good. Can I go home to my family now? No, no, I believe in this company. Listen, the market's clear. Their patents are in. It's good. I'm bringing this only to my best customers. You're number three for the day. We can start out small if you want. Okay, okay. Now I'll send it over to you. Yeah. I don't know. This is gonna be great. All right, thank you. All right, bye, Bob. Ed, My Man. Look at you, Man. I don't know how you do it. I just sell it to 'em straight, Man. You know, that's funny because usually our business runs on bullshitting as much as possible. I don't know what to say. I guess I got the magic touch. Yeah, that's good, Man. Hey, you keep it up, okay? You're doing a great job, Ed. Hey, um, listen, so, um... I'm about to go talk to the big boys upstairs. Usually we go on these vacations. Hunting trips, you know, and I want to see if you're okay with going with us. I mean, I'm not really much of a hunter. Hey, hey, Bro, look, I understand, okay? Neither was I. I mean, look at me, right? But there's really not much to it, you know? But I'm telling you, Man, if you get in good with these guys on that level, it'll do wonders for your career. I'm talking about major money, okay? All right, Man, so how's that sound? I'll run it by my wife and get back to you after lunch? Talk to the wife? Hey, Man, talk to the wife. Let me know. I'll go upstairs and talk to them. Okay. All right, Man. I'll put in a good word for you. Thank you. Keep up the good work. Look, I understand. I don't care about his kids. Fire him. Okay. What do you think of that new guy? Nice guy, smart. I think he could make us a lot of money. Well, any of these guys could make us a lot of money. What makes him different? Well, I can see it in his eyes. Kinda like you. How so? Sometimes you just know. Good job with this. What makes him like me? He's ambitious. He's smart. And that's the killer inside. Well, where is he now? As a matter of fact, he's with Ian right now. So catch up with him. You can go. All right. William, where you at? I got groceries. Edward! Look at you. How you doing, Pal? I'm good. How about yourself? Oh, I'm strong as an ox. Do not let the limp fool you. I believe it. You can set those down. How's Kelly doing? She's doing good. You know, the new place, getting territorial with the cats. Sounds about right. Hey, listen, I appreciate you not telling her about this. It's all right, it really is. It's good. Oh, Ed, I just.. I'm really sorry. I wish I wasn't hurt. I've worked for 40 years, and here I am. This is how they treat me. My own son in law, you know, sneaking me money. I don't deserve this. I don't deserve you, Ed. It's okay, it really is. You're family. Aw, Dude, give me a hug. Good cat. Let get these here. Hey, Amagashi, I got your stuff right over here. Yeah, I got it right here. All your bodies, Man. What do you guys need so many bodies for? I do not talk to you, okay? Listen, listen to me. You stop right now, okay? I don't talk to the helper. Helper? Answer my question: How many American bodies do you have? Hey, I'm the one that gets you these bodies. As many as you want, I got 'em. Male, female. I know what you like with those females too. Are they all in this hole-y shape? They're in great shape. So unprofessional. You put it in the trash bag, put it in the cold. Please. It's in here, it's quick. All the other ones are nice, nice wrapped tight. Right now I need numbers. How many American bodies can you buy? 50, 75, 100. I don't buy them. I get 'em for you. I'll get you all of them. Okay, okay, I talk to your boss. I do not talk to you, okay? You go talk to boss, get him in here. Me and him, we can negotiate. Go get your boss. We talking. Yeah, all right, whatever. Let me go get the boss, Man. He'll talk to you. I'll get the boss. Mm. Mm. So business is good, huh? Business is good. I have 40 trucks. I have sole distributorship. None of my trucks bounce. I work hard. I work very hard. But I need consistent supply. I need quality. So quality was good last time, right? I'm hoping on our next shipment, we get a lower price point, lower number. Quality should reflect the price, no? Absolutely. So I give you good quality, you give me good price. Mm. Human bodies should not be that expensive. I beg to differ. I put in a lot of work. And a human body never goes out of style. Hmm... I like to be consistent, and I like to be loyal, so we look forward to doing more business, okay? I like loyalty too. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Cheers. I am the last one out of the office again. Kelly's gonna kill me by the time I get home. Just want to snuggle up on the couch and fall asleep. That's exactly what I'm saying. Wait, hold up a sec. Edward! Oh, hey, Mr. McArthur! Got a minute? Uh, sure, yeah. Meet me for a drink. Yes, yeah, sure. So, Edward, do you shoot? No. Played some paintball. Well, Ian comes to me, and he tells me that you were interested in our hunting trip. Um... Drink? Thank you. Um.., Mr. McArthur, could I ask you a question? Yeah, shoot. Are you married? Depends on the city and state. But, yeah, I am. Why do you ask? Do you have any kids? Kids. Do I have kids? No, I don't, but what does that have to do with this trip? It's just been on my mind a lot recently. You know, whether I'd be a good dad, be able to provide for my family. Look, you do very well for yourself, Edward. 28 years old, making a lot of money. You know, you do good for yourself. I do all right. How much do you make, actually? Um, well, I haven't even been here quite a year, but I think I'm at 83, 84. So you don't do that well. Okay, how would you like to double your money? You know, we could absolutely double it. Sounds amazing. Look, you go on this here camping trip. We camp, we hunt, we bond. That's what we do. If you're interested in making more money, I can help with that. Nick can help with that. All right. There's a lot of money to be made. Let's go make some money. Okay. All right. You are not a hunter! That's what I told Ian, but he insisted. These are my bosses. What was I supposed to say? Try no! Could you just support me on this one just a little bit, please? Just this one, okay. If I was to come home tomorrow and tell you that I was going on vacation with a bunch of my friends to kill animals, you would be okay with that. I'm not going to kill any animals. I'm just going along for the beer and the laughs. Have a good time. It's a one time thing. This is not okay! That's easy for you to say. It's not your job on the line. You did not just fucking say that! I'm the only one with a job right now. I'm the only one bringing in money. I'm trying to keep this roof over our head. We just bought this house! Clean your own fucking dishes. Hello. Hey, William, it's Ed. Am I bugging you? Nah, not at all. Just eating chips. What is it, Big Guy? I just.. I really need someone to talk to. Ed, you were saying something about a hunting trip? Yeah, it's for work, but... If it makes her this angry, maybe I just shouldn't go. Right. Well, if it's for work, would you get fired if you didn't go? No, no, that's not it. It's just my one chance to get into this inner circle, to make something for myself there, to be successful... For her. Listen, if you need to stop helping me... No, no, that's not it. I should be able to support my family. I should be able to take them on vacations, pay for college. I just.. That's not it at all. Does she know this? She might have her suspicions, but I don't want to scare her. We just bought a house. She's not working. Right. Okay, go home, get some sleep. I'll come over and talk to her. Do what you need to do. Okay. All right. Thanks, William. She might be mad now, but she loves you. It'll fade. I hope. Got a good batch here. 200 points. 500 points for them big ass titties right there. I'm getting that. I'm getting up in that. Yeah. It's a lot of money on the table. Yeah, I'm winning this. Okay. I wanna win this. See, you care about points. I care about money. You should be coming in strong. You should be coming in fast. You should come in hot! You're becoming a little weak, Tony. You're thinking too much. How much is Nick giving us to win this thing? I don't know. He said something about a Ferrari. But what kind of motivation do you need? I want to win. Well, let's have you win. What about the new guy, is he in? Seems like it. All right. We good? Yeah. ♪ I'm losing control Help me, God ♪ ♪ Easy just to see the flames ♪ I'm sorry about the time I left you lonely ♪ ♪ I'm sorry about the time when you wanted to hold me ♪ ♪ I'm sorry about the time that I couldn't even give you ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's gone ♪ All gone Hey, hey, hey. Hey, wake up! What? Where am I? I wish I knew. We got no idea. Help! Help! Help! Stop, stop yelling! Stop! We don't know where we are, just like you, and nobody's out there trying to find us, so what's the point? So shut the fuck up already, yeah? Hey, she doesn't even know what's going on. I don't give a fuck. Come on, stop cussing. Who are you people? Why are they doing this? We have no idea, okay? We're in the same boat as you. We were kidnapped. This can't be happening. What's your name? What's your name? Uh, Maggie. Maggie, I'm Cynthia. Maggie, why don't you do me a favor and tell us what the last thing you remember before waking up is. I was leaving work. Um... I can't. She doesn't know. She has been drugged. Leave her alone. I don't understand why! That's bullshit, Man. Fuck. Hey, come on with the language, please. Fuck, look how I am. You want to check my fucking language? No way. You know, have some respect for everything that everybody is going through in here. How dare you. Shit. How long have you guys been here? Well, I've been here the longest. About five days. I've been like two. Oh, God. Big Ed, what's up, Man! I'm glad you could join us! What took you so long? Gotta hit the road, Man. Ready? Uh, why don't you go ahead and do this? What's wrong with you? Nothing. It's just, you know, I don't like needles and blood and all of that, so... I mean, you'll be all right. Fine. I'll be here if you need me. And they're all crooked like. I mean, it's obvious. What's going on? Nothing's going on. Nothing. But she knows who Chase Thomas is. He's my ex-boyfriend. Guess he's telling me you guys are looking for him. Would he be inside the tattoo parlor? Man, he's not gonna be in there. No? He doesn't hang in there. There's a bar down the street. He's gonna be there. That's where you'll find him. I can take you there. What's the name of the bar? Steak and Titties. Excuse me, we're looking for a Mr. Chase Thomas. I don't know any Chase Thomas. Sorry. You don't remember me, do you? Yeah, I do. Thomas Curry. His son went missing over 2 1/2 years ago. Never found him. I don't know who she is. How did she know all that? You know, I've been trying to figure that out ever since she was recruited from the academy. How are you, Mr. Curry? Shit. That's how I'm doing. Like shit. Sorry about that. You guys, you FBI guys come in here... Come in here for a drink, huh? You bring a young lady and come here for a drink? Or should you be out there doing your job? Doing your job looking for my son. You go to the coffee shops to have drinks, but you're not doing your job looking for my son. It's been two fucking years! This is bullshit! Well, that's not fair! It's okay. Mr. Curry, we're here chasing a lead. There was a kidnapping attempt. We want to stop that from ever happening again. I'm sorry about your son, and in no way have we ever given up hope of finding him or anyone, and we never will. That's him! What? Hey, Mr. Thomas. We're with the FBI here, and we need your help identifying someone who may be wearing one of your tattoos. Oh, that dude? Yeah, I knew him. He's a ranch hand around here. I don't know which one though. There's like 30 in the area. Do you have a name? I don't. I just called him Pablo. That's not his real name though. I just called him that 'cause I thought it was funny. Thank you for your help, Sir. You coming? No, I'm gonna stay back. Contact the sheriff, have him get that sketch to every man he's got. We need to check every ranch in the area. We also need to contact the Bureau. Yo! Dude, Bro, what's up, Man? Oh, shit. You look good! Thank you. You too. What are you doing here, Man? Hey, Mom said you were supposed to call her last night. Yeah, I'm working. McBride. This is my partner McBride. My brother. Nice to meet you. Uh, this is Ed from work. How you doing, Ed? Nice to meet you. McBride. Hi. So you really working, Man? Busting bad guys? Exactly. What are you doing? I didn't expect to see you. What brings you here? Steak and titties. You guys sell insurance or something? FBI. Pretty, Big Boy. This is for the food and the women. Same as all the other girls. So, uh, what's going on between you and your brother? I noticed some tension out there. Man, we've been distant for a while now. Since high school. I guess he's mad at me. Guess he thought I was gonna be an FBI agent like him. Why would he think that? There's been cops in my family for generations. Then why aren't you one? Do you know how much cops make a year? Yeah. Okay. Let me tell you something, Man. I like to get money, Baby, okay? And I'll do whatever it takes to get that. Shit, I've got a lifestyle to maintain. Could I get more, Kristen? Now how am I gonna convince you to get one of these ladies, Man? Come on, Man. Come on, Man. I didn't really like him before. I like him now, but I just think he might be too much of a good guy. I think he might be right. He'll be fine. Trust me. All you gotta do is do him like you did the others, okay? Yeah? We got lucky with Ian. He's a cool dude, but the two guys before him, they were such good brokers too, you know what I mean? You're both so negative, Man. Come on. Look forward to tomorrow, all right? It'll be a good hunt. Do it or I'll kill ya. You sure you don't want to go with us? Yeah. I'm sure I'm going on a picnic. Nah, I'm sure, Man. It's a young man's game. Break in the new kid. It'll be fun. Okay? You got it. Get the fuck outta here. Oh, wow, look at the 'hos! Hello, Ladies! Hi! Hell yeah! Look at the nice smile, like he's been on a picnic. Oh, you're never gonna let me live it down, will you, Nick? Look forward to tomorrow. Enjoy the hunt, okay? Be cool. I cannot believe that he actually went after that big fight we had. He is selfish, you know that? Selfish! He's not selfish. He's a grown man. Him and his friends acting like big men, killing defenseless animals. It's not that serious. I've hunted before. Well, then you're sick too! Get out of my house! Kell-bell, you need to calm down and give him a break. He's your husband. He should've thought of that before going off to play Rambo. He's not! He just wants to be good at his new job. You let him do what he needs to do to provide for his wife and his future family. Excuse me? I'm not pregnant! Who the fuck told you I was pregnant? Um... Damn girl, you know I love you in those leather pants. You know I wore 'em just for you. You said you was coming back, so I had to take care of that for you. And that's why I love vacation. Right? And it's a nice night. It is a beautiful night. Yeah. I know you're not looking at the sky when you say it. Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, the sky is nice too, you know. Hey, Ed! Ed, man, come on out here and get some of this! Oh, Man. You know how it is when a guy's on their first time. Oh, yeah, I remember yours. Hey. You're not outside with the others. Why not? It looks like a blast. Not really my scene. I miss my wife enough as it is. I'd rather be in here. Fair enough. Understood. You're not the usual stockbroker that I've come across in all my years. Too mild mannered. I don't know. I just see us, you know, putting people together. People need to make money, businesses need the investment. Try not to bullshit anybody. Right. That's fair enough. Hey, oh! Ed, did you call your wife? Yeah. She didn't answer though. You don't have to come hunting tomorrow if you don't want. You can always stay in here and watch TV. Thanks, but I mean, that's why I came up here, right? The bonding, the adventure. Just not the hookers. What's wrong with hookers? I'm just kidding. Look, call your wife again and get her on the phone. If you don't, and if she doesn't pick up, leave a message. That's the only advice I can give in all my years of fucking up. And cover your back. All right, I will. Thanks, Nick. Oh, hey, sure thing. Honey, it's me again. I miss you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I came on this stupid trip. I'm sorry for the fight. It's killing me how angry you were. I love you. When I get back, we need to get away. Just you and me away from everything. Please call me when you get this. Yeah, Man, you almost got it! You almost got it! I'll get it. Fucking motherfucker! What the fuck you trying to do, you fucking little bitch! Man, who are you? Why are we here? Stop it! Stop it, you son of a bitch! Stop! Oh, my God! I'll fucking kill you! They don't usually take this long. Shit, Man. They're waiting, huh? I think that chick gave me something last night, Man. Which one? Talking about Nick's girl? Yeah, Man. She was thick. I would have taken something from her too. Wait, what you got, like gonorrhea or something? I don't know. It just itches. Hope it's not herpes. That's the gift that keeps on giving. I know. You got it? You got it? Ian, you don't see nothing? Ian, anything? Ed, what's up? Nah, Man. It's been over an hour. What'd y'all do? It's hiding. I don't see nothing. I mean, maybe I'm not using this thing right, but... You put the small thing in your eye and the big part on the outside. You get it? Okay. He don't even know. I should just... Wanna move out? What happened? Wait, I think I see a guy. Oh, okay, okay. He just walked out of those trees. Over there, like one o'clock. Okay, okay. Is he wearing loafers? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, I got one, I got one! Let's do it, Ian, just like I showed you, let's go! Show him something! Whoo! Yes! Let's go! Who holds the lead now, Baby? Yeah! Let's go! Come on, give me that. It's not heavy. Let's go! Whoo! Slow this shit down! Let's go! That's what I'm talking about, Baby! Heck yeah! 800? 800! 800! He's still breathing. No, he's okay, he's okay. I got it. Let me show you something. Let me show you something. See, this is what we do. You go like this. Okay, here, take it. Take the fucking gun. Look, you guys, call an ambulance. Let's get fucking serious here. Look, take the gun. No, no. I'm not shooting anyone. This is what we're hunting, Man. Come on, don't embarrass me now. Call a fucking ambulance. He's still alive. A fu.. A fucking ambulance? You guys are crazy. It's either him or you. I'm not killing anybody. You're not killing anybody? No. Okay. Hey, is everything all right in here? Something.. Something is wrong with Edward. What are you saying? There's something wrong. I know. I can feel it. Calm down. Nothing's wrong with Ed. He's gonna be fine. You're just coming down from the big fight you had. It's okay. I want him here, Daddy. I don't want him to be hurt. He's fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Come here. Oh, Baby. Ah... So hard to be a woman. Maggie! Chen! Maggie! Oh, my God. This wasn't a dream. Where is everyone? Have you seen Cynthia? No. Are you all right? Yeah. How long have you been here? I don't know. I just woke up. Overnight. I was sleeping right over that hill over there overnight too. Are we the only ones that made it? I guess. I don't know. I haven't seen anyone else. How long ago did you get out? Right after Cynthia did. I haven't seen her. Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere. We gotta get going and find them. All right. You okay? Yeah. Oh, God. All right, let's go. Hey, are you okay? I feel a little faint, like I'm gonna puke. Where do you think we are? We're in the middle of nowhere! Nobody's here. We gotta keep moving. We can't be too far from civilization, right? Do you want me to help you? No, I'm fine. What about the others? We don't even know if they're alive or not. We just gotta pick a direction and go. Okay, yeah, but where do we go? Where do we go? That's Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Hey, we can't hear you! Cynthia, come here! We can't hear you! What? What is she saying? Come here! Where are you going? Cynthia! Run! Let's go. Did we lose them? Time to load up! We're getting a white rabbit! What the fuck? I thought we was hunting people. You didn't see the list, Ian? The white rabbit is the Asian girl with big titties. That's the white rabbit. Right. Get your head in the game! All right, Baby. Let's go get yours! Let's go, let's go! I got dibs on the Asian bitch. We all got her. I don't know why you're getting silent. Man, let's go! Spread out! You go that way. I got dibs on the.. We'll see, we'll see, all right? All right! Hey, I already got Hajib, Man. Money, money, money. I got something already. Come on, Baby, don't be shy! Hey, where you at, Man? Hey, where you at? (Spanish) Hey, how you doing? You see the gun, right? So you're not gonna run, scream, nothing? When my mom passed, and she was on her deathbed, she mentioned something to me. She said your life really does flash before your eyes when you're dying. And I never understood what she meant because at that moment, she was still alive. But when death is coming, and you start to think about all those little moments in life, that's the flash. Plus Jesus said in the Bible that I should never fear the one that could kill the body because you can't destroy my soul. Instead, I should only fear the one that has the ability to destroy the mind, the body, and the soul. Besides, I lived a happy life. So you're not gonna run, scream or nothing? Hell, you should be the one that's afraid. Okay. Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! I got one! White man! 750! Fuck you, son of a bitch! Oh, come on, Man, don't be no poor sport on me, Man. I ain't gonna play with you no more, goddammit. What the fuck is wrong with you, Man? The fuck's wrong with me? What the fuck is wrong with you? Running and shit got me out of breath! Hey, Man... I really want the Asian bitch with the big ass titties. You fucking sick pig! Oh, Man, I heard it all before. Fuck! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! I hate using my hands! No, no, no, no, yeah, mm-hmm. It's okay. It's okay. He can't hurt you anymore. I got the bad guy. It's okay. Come on, let's get you cleaned up. Damn... Oh, look at you and the Bulgari. Yeah, right. Uh-huh. Hey, that's him! Freeze! Freeze! Hey! Look at you. Motherfucker made me run. Was it worth it, Punk? Stop resisting. We're doing this above board, then kick his ass. I'm gonna go call for backup. Hey, right on, Man. What the fuck, Man? That bitch roughed me up, Dude. Go get the keys from her, Man. She's got 'em in her pocket. What the fuck, Man? Go get the keys, Man. Shut the fuck up. You'll be okay. I promise I wont shoot. Not a pretty girl like yourself. You gotta be a fine bitch if you wanna be a cop. You gotta be a fine bitch if you wanna be a cop, right? Come on. Maybe we can, you know... Work something out. He shot Chen! He just started bashing the head in. He came up behind me and started choking me. I just want to go home. I just want to go home. You saved their lives. Not really. I was just following you. Thought I'd go out on my own and explore a little bit. That's all I did. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your partner. Thanks. Sorry about your son. Yeah, well, at least he didn't die in vain. We stopped them. That's what's important. They found a survivor out there. Luckily he's a big guy. Anybody else that's 50 pounds lighter would've died out there by now. Let's go. I'm okay. All right, I got an adult male, mid 20's. He's got a gunshot wound, upper thorax, left side. ETA is about 17 minutes. All right. I'm alive? Yeah, Buddy, you're alive, you're alive. I get to see my wife again. (Mumbling) I get to see her again. You sure do, Son.
