The old chap's got a nerve keeping us hanging about like this. I'm afraid he's very feeble, Mr. Ventnor, very feeble. Oh, and it just gets about. Sticks to his directorships all right, Mr. Brumby. Can't retire, I fear. Lives on his fees, they tell me. The old guinea pig. I think one must admire his resolution. Quite a figure in Liverpool these 20 years. Quite. Awful old rib. Mm-hmm. Oh, well. Have they come, Mr. Farney? Oh, yes sir. But after the long board meeting you've just been through, I wasn't going to wake you. I haven't been asleep. I've been awake. I suppose you know what they've come for. Did I understand, sir, it was a meeting of your, uh, creditors? You did. 13 years ago, I bought a gold mine, Mr. Farney. Bought it lock, stock, and barrel. Half in cash, half in promises. These are the promises. I've never been able to pay 'em off. The mine was as empty as their heads. Oh, well. Not bankrupt yet. Oh, no indeed, sir. No one can get you down. Help me up, Mr. Farney. Got at least one family he oughtn't do. Is that so? It's a fact. Rosimund Larne. She writes stories. Client of mine. She's the widow of a son of his born long before his marriage. Fine-looking woman she is, too. Ah, the early Victorians, before the influence of the dear old Queen. Well, times change. Uh, gentlemen. Excuse me, gentlemen. I've just had a long board meeting. Well, my bankers. I've given you every information, I hope. Mr. Heythorp, er, we are here to represent some ?14,000. When we had the pleasure of meeting you last July, you held out a prospect of some more satisfactory arrangement by Christmas. Well, we are now in February. And I am bound to say, none of us get younger. Don't you? I feel like a boy. Hmm, well, to come to the point, we feel, Mr. Heythorp, not unreasonably, I think, that, um, well, your bankruptcy would be the most satisfactory solution. We see no prospect of improvement. We've, er, we've waited a long time. Er, indeed, we fear the opposite. You think I'm going to join the majority, eh? Put it that way if you like. My grandfather lived to be a hundred. My father, 96. Only 80-odd myself, and a blameless life compared with theirs. Indeed. We hope you have many years of life before you, many. You're getting ?1,000 a year out of my fees. I'll make it ?1,300. Bankrupt me, I lose my directorships and you don't get a rap. But what about... The house I live in and everything in it, bar me togs, me wine, and me cigars, belong to my daughter, under a settlement. A settlement? 15 years old. Oh. Haven't got anything else. Position in a nutshell, gentlemen. No, we should think you should make it at least ?1,500, Mr. Heythorp. We understand your fees and your directorships to be some ?2,000 a year, sir. ?1,900 in a good year. My season drink must have a mantle of alchemy. Not as active as I was. Of course. Your people depended on me. ?1,300 a year is all I can offer ya, gentlemen. It's no use, er, beating about the bush. Take it or leave it. And if we leave it? Kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, that's all. Er, Mr. Heythorp, er, in consideration of your advanced, um... Age? Er, we should accept your offer of ?1,300 a year. Ah, keep the bird alive. Sound policy. Er, we think you will do your best to give us all you can, and we wish you many years of life. Much obliged to you. Very sporting of you gentlemen. I shall act towards you in the same spirit. Good day, sir. Good day. Er, good day, then, sir. Good day. Er, don't get up. I'd be, er... Good day. Er, good day. God bless you. Sorry not to have been able to join the mutual admiration society, Mr. Heythorp. Your debt to me is ?300. I think it might be worth your while to consider whether you can't settle that separately. Huh? I'm a lawyer, and neither very trustful nor very patient. So, you'll go behind their backs, do ya? You're a fine specimen of a lawyer. I beg your pardon, sir. I thought you were alone. You made a big mistake in saying that, Mr. Heythorp. Good evening. That's an ugly dog. What's his name? Ventnor, sir. A solicitor. There are two ladies to see you, sir. Ladies? A Mrs. and Miss Larne. There's a boy with them. Oh. All right. Let them come in. Hmm. Come in, please. Thank you. Now, be good. Oh, Jock, you awful boy. Young rascal. So sorry. Gardy. Hello. Dear old Gardy. Do forgive us for coming. But I just had to see you. Is this Phyllis? Bless my soul. She's growing out of all knowledge. Good heavens, she's... she's a woman. Yes. Isn't it naughty of her? I really had to come and see you, Gardy. We hadn't had a sight of you in such an age. Jock. How are you, dear old Gardy? Never better, but I haven't a penny for you. How naughty of you to think I came for that. But I am in a terrible fix, Gardy. I never knew you not to be. I'm having the most dreadful time. You know, Gardy, but for your ?300, I'm entirely dependent on my pen. I was counting on at least ?200 for my new story, and the wretches refused it. Such a delightful story. It's hard, Gardy. I worked my brains silly over it. Rats. Gardy. You couldn't, I suppose, let me have just one little ?100? I'm not a bee. Gardy, you are so like my dear Phillip. Your dear Phillip? You led him a devil of a life, or I'm a Dutchman. Gardy. This is an absolute crisis. I expect to be sold up at any moment. And I daren't tell the children. They're so happy, poor darlings. I've been obliged to take Jock away from school. What? And Phyllis has had to stop her piano and dancing. Just imagine, Gardy, if your grandchildren were thrown out into the street. Well, even if they don't know it, still you are their grandfather. You really must do something for them. Something for them? Gardy. Wait a bit. I might be able to. How lovely. Gardy, could you let me have ?50? There's such a young man in there. He can only just see over his car. Excuse me, please, Gardy. Help me up. Well, love me? Oh, Gardy, I adore you. Your mother tells me you've had to give up your dancing. Yes. Mother's broke. And your music. Well, it doesn't matter, Gardy. It's a beast of shame. Why shouldn't I? Gardy, don't make such wicked faces. I've got an idea. A wicked one? Yes. Ooh! Er, wait here while I wrestle with it. # Where did you get that hat? # Is that your brother? Yes. Isn't he a terror? He goes off all the time like fireworks. Like fireworks? I say, that's rather funny. Do you mind telling me your name? Phyllis. How ripping. My name's Bob, Bob Pillin. Are you a relation of Old English? Old English? What? Don't you know his nickname? No. We just call him Gardy. Isn't he a toot? A toot! I say, you are funny. A... a toot. Gardy, we must go. Good-bye. You will do something, won't you? Good-bye. The children are so fond of you, Gardy. Good-bye. Come along, Phyllis, dear. Oh, Mr. Pillin. Will you see us to our train? Why, of course. Uh, Miss Larne? Oh. Good-bye, Gardy, darling. Did you wrestle with it? I did. Was it a good idea? It was a great idea. You shall have your dancing, and your music too. But mind, chaps like that young pup, not for you. All the same mold. No drive. No vices. Nothing. Calls himself a spark? Well, when I was his age, I'd... Well, I broke my neck and I lost my last bob on the derby. Had you, Gardy? How lovely. I wish you'd come and see us oftener. Do ya? I'll come tomorrow. That would be lovely! Hold on, mother! Fresh as April. Clean, round stock. Miss, er, Heythorp is below, sir, with a carriage to take you home. She said she'll wait. The devil she does. And old Mr. Pillin has just come in. Bring him here. Mr. Farney. Yes, sir. I don't want to be disturbed. Very good, sir. By George, I'll do it. Mr. Pillin. Well, Sylvanus. Hello, Joe. About my shipments. Have a cigar. Cigar? You know I never smoke 'em. You've a monstrous constitution, Sylvanus. If I drank port and smoked cigars... You always were as scary as an old hen. Oh, now, about me ships. I'm getting anxious. I want to retire. Freights are very depressed. I've got my family to think of. Well, why don't you go broke? That'll back you up like anything. Well, hasn't your board decided today? The ?60,000 I'm asking is a very small price for four good ships. Well, Sylvanus? Make it worth my while, Joe, or it won't go through. Worth your while? How do you mean? A commission? You could never let it be known. Who wants to? Oh. I'll get your ?60,000 for your ships if you'll give me 10 percent of it. But... If you don't, the deal's off, Joe. Not a brass rap. Why, dear Sylvanus. A commission? It's not legal! I'm taking nothing myself, not a penny piece. I want you to settle it on some proteges of mine. But it's a breach of trust. And there's nothing to prevent you from executing a settlement on some third parties. Mm. Who's your lawyer? Lawyer? Oh, Scriben's my lawyer. Oh, well, get him to draw out the deed tomorrow morning. Bring it to me here tomorrow afternoon after the general meeting. If the sale goes through, you'll sign it. If it doesn't, you tear it up. Who are these... these third parties? A woman and her children. I must make provision for her. Oh, uh, uh, uh. Oh, oh, oh. Afraid, you hoop? You afraid of being mixed up with a woman? Well, you may laugh. I am afraid of being mixed up with someone else's woman. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. I have not lead you alive, Sylvanus. Lucky for you, you'd have been dead long ago. Now, tell your lawyer it's an old flame of yours, you old dog. I might be subject to blackmail. Ah, tell him to keep your name dock. Oh, I don't like it, Sylvanus. I don't, really. Well, leave it and be hang to ya. There'll be no sale, Joe. Is there no other way? No. This needs to be settled tomorrow. And if I don't pitch it strong to the shareholders, the sale won't go through, and that's flat. But it's playing round the law, Sylvanus. There's no law to prevent you from doing what you like with your own money. I'm taking nothing myself, not a cent. Why, you... you assist the fatherless and widowed. That's just your line, Joe. What a fellow you are. You don't seem capable of taking anything seriously. Well, care killed the cat. Well? No, no, no. I don't think I can do it. Besides, such a sacrifice, ?6,000. Eh, well, get another bid if you can. Freights will go lower yet. Oh. Oh, do you think so? Sure of it. Oh... Very well, Sylvanus. I suppose I must. Oh, and here's the name for your lawyer. Write it down. Rosimund Larne. With an E. 23 Millicent Villas, Liverpool. Widow of Phillip Larne, late of Dublin, Balustrade Lawn. Well... Income to her until her children, Phyllis and John, come of age or marry, then to said children in equal shares. Got that? Yes. You'll get that drawn tomorrow morning. Well, it seems to me very irregular, very risky. Go home and drink a bottle of champagne on it. Ah. Good night, Joe. No deed, no deal. No, no, no, no. I trust ya. Well, good night, Sylvanus. You always were a daredevil. Good night. Good night, Joe. Eh... oh. He'll jump. It's better than beggary for him. Miss Heythorp. You really ought not to be so late, Father. It's most dangerous at this time of year. Are you ready now? No, I am not. It's really terrible, the way that you neglect your health. I've noticed that every time you drink port, you do something dangerous next day. And of course you eat too much. Anyone would think you were 40 instead of over 80. And not if they saw you. Well, really, Father! Is that your idea of repartee? Who were your visitors? Ladies and a boy. So I saw. What ladies and what boy? My daughter-in-law and my grandchildren. That's all. Do you mean to say that you were married before you married my mother? No. Not married. I see. I begin to understand your difficulties. Are there any more of them? I suppose you don't realize that this is not an agreeable discovery. I really don't know what to think. Oh, think what you like. Are you coming? No! You'll be late for dinner. Dine in me old room, if you care. Well, I don't see why you should lose your temper. 'Cause I can't get up, you think you can stand there and bully me. Well, really, Father. I come here especially to take you home and you call it bullying you. Paddle me own canoe, thank you. Self-righteous cat. Yes, sir. Help me up. Yes, sir. Had you young gentlemen forgotten me? Mr. Farney said you didn't want to be disturbed, sir. Get me my hat and coat. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Is that carriage gone? Yes, sir. All right. Tell Mr. Farney to come to me at noon about my speech for the general meeting tomorrow. Yes, sir. And thank you. Good night to you. Good night, sir. Good night, sir. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is that fellow Farney with that four-wheeler? He seems a nice person. Hear. Hey, son. Hey, son! Everybody's gone to sleep. And so we have come to an arrangement with Messrs. Pillin, owners of the four steam ships Smyrna, Damascus, Tyre, and Sight, vessels in prime condition at the low, inclusive price of ?60,000. Gentlemen, vestigia nulla retrorsum. Never go backwards. Times are bad, but they are touching bottom. No. I have said the freights will go up. This is the moment for a forward stroke. With the utmost confidence, we recommend your ratification of this purchase, which we believe will soon substantially increase the profits of the company. Before moving the adoption of the reports, we welcome any comments from shareholders. Mr. Bettlesby. I should like, if I may be allowed, to congratulate the board on having piloted our ships so smoothly through the troublous waters of the past year. Hear, hear. I confess the present dividend of 4 percent is not one which satisfies every, er, aspiration. Hear, hear. But speaking for myself, and I hope for others, I recognize that in all the aspects of the case, it is as much as we have a right to expect. No, no. Our chairman, whose strategic wisdom has been proved on many a field, would not so strongly advocate the purchase of these Pillin ships without good reason. He well said, "Vestigia nulla re... retorium." I venture to think there can be no better motto for Englishmen. Hear, hear. I want to know much more about this proposition to purchase these ships. I doubt its wisdom. I very much doubt it. To whom was the proposal first made? To me, sir. The chairman says to him. Very well. But what I want to know is, why are Pillins selling if freights are to go up, as a chairman prophesies. - It's a matter of opinion. - Quite so. And in my opinion, they're going lower, and Pillins are right to sell. If that's so, we're wrong to buy. No, no. Pillins are shrewd people. - They're rattled. - Businessmen rattled? Well, rattled or not, I think it's a rash purchase in such bad times as these. We are losing our freight hand over hand. The old country is sound enough. Well, I can see no signs of it. I agree with Mr. Westgate. I can see nothing in the present condition of shipping which calls for confidence. I deprecate the proposal. Any other shareholder have anything to say before I put the report to the meeting? Yes, sir. Mr. Westgate requires answering. I don't like this business, either. I don't impute anything to anybody. But I don't like the short notice we've had and all the weight of things pressed on us. Not only that, but to say the truth, I'm not satisfied to be galloped over in this fashion by one who, whatever he may have been in the past, is now clearly not in his prime. My best services have been at your disposal 19 years. My experience of shipping is a little greater than that of the three gentlemen who spoke last. Hear, hear. I can say so. If I am not in my prime, my brain is sound and my heart stuffed. There is a tide in the affairs of limited companies. I, for one, am not content to stagnate. If you want to stagnate, then give your support to these gentlemen and have done with it. But I have said freights will go up before the end of the year. The purchase is sound. It's more than sound. It's a bargain! And I stand all four by it. Hear, hear. It has been painful to me, painful, and I have no doubt to others, to hear an attack made on the chairman. If he is old in body, he is young in mental vigor and courage. I wish we were all as young. We ought to support him, gentlemen. We ought to support him. We... we don't want sentiment interfering with our judgement in this matter. The question is simply, "How are our pockets to be affected?" Hear, hear! Yes. I came here with some misgiving. I can't say I've lost it. But on the whole, I say on the whole, I favor the proposition. The ships are undoubtedly very cheap. We've got these reserves and we might as well use them. The chairman knows his way about. Any more remarks? Very well. I move the ratification of the purchase of the Pillin ships. I second that. All in favor, signify the same in the usual way. Counter up. Carried! - Any other business? - Chairman... I move the meeting be adjourned. All in favor of countering the meeting adjourned. Congratulations. Thank you. They make me sick. Can I see the chairman, Mr. Farney? Well, I'll see. Here's Mr. Pillin, sir. Well, how do you do, Mr. Pillin? I know your son. I know we've bought your ships. I hope they'll do us some good. Mr. Ventnor, I think. Very good. Very cold, isn't it? The chairman will see you presently. Oh, thanks. Oh, it'll be all right. Oh, tell them not to worry. Make it a letter from me. Tell him not to lose any sleep about it. That's fellow's remarks were most impertinent. No, no, no. I like to hear 'em bite and scratch. It amuses them, doesn't hurt us. Remember to hand that to Gile, would you, dear? Oh. Yeah. Thank you. Bye-bye. Don't smoke it in the wind. Well, Sylvanus, aren't you perished? What a quavering thread papery chap you are, Joe. Take off that coat. I? I'd be lost without my furs. You must have a fire inside ya. Sound innards, nothing more. So, er, it's gone through, Sylvanus. Hmm, it means a wretched price for me, wretched. You ought to think yourself jolly lucky, Joe. You've brought that deed? Yes. I've signed it, but I don't like it. You stampeded me, Sylvanus, playing on my nerves like that. Your... your lawyer must think think you a sad dog, Joe. Suppose it comes to the knowledge of my wife after midday. Well, nothing will make you shiver then. That's very bad taste, Sylvanus. Well, you've got your way. You always do. Eh, who is this Mrs. Larne? The mother of my grandchildren under the rose, Joe. Oh, ah. And you provided for 'em. That's the finest thing you ever did. Oh, I'm sorry you told me. It's even worse than I thought. It's a clear breach of trust on your part. There's no question. And I'm conniving at it, though. As soon as the transfer of the ships is signed, I should get off abroad. This cold's killing me. I wish you'd give me your recipe for keeping warm. I get a new inside and drink port. Hmm. And yet I suppose, with your full habit, your life hangs by a thread, eh? Stout one, my boy. Hmm. Well, I must be getting home. Good-bye, Sylvanus. You're a Job's comforter. I don't like it. Will you see Mr. Pezner now, sir? All right. Things are looking up for you, Mr. Heythorp. Your predators put their tails between their legs yesterday thanks to Mr. Brownbee, and you've carried your purchase through today thanks to me. Come to your point, sir, if you've got one. Oh, yes, I've got one. You had your way, Mr. Heythorp, but this meeting might've turned very nasty. If the shareholders had turned you down, where would you have been? In a soup, but they didn't. No, they... they just didn't. But I could've turned the scales against you. Your position, Mr. Heythorp, if I may say so, is precarious, in spite of the way you carry it off. And will you come to the point, sir? Yes, this is it. Am I to make it more precarious? How? By filing a petition for your bankruptcy. That'll be quite enough to tip the beam. Fire away! You won't pay me, then? No! Is that wise, Mr. Heythorp? Is it wise? Take time. Think it over. By the way, you put the price for that purchase pretty high, didn't you? Not a bit too high. Freights are touching bottom. They'll go up soon. You know what passed through my mind? Not an idea. Ah. And you won't reconsider your refusal? You heard the spotty way the others treated me yesterday. Let 'em down by giving you preference? Not for Joe. Mr. Heythorp, you've had your own way all your life, quite frankly. I'm sure I've had. Giving you the idea that you can always have it. Once more, won't you reconsider? No, I will not, and that's that. Very good, Mr. Heythorp. Very good indeed. You've not heard the last of this. Good day. Good day to you. That cur smells a rat. How dare you talk to me like that? I tell you she's not at home. No, she never is at home. Well, she's not at home now, anyhow. All right, I'll have to cut off the water. The man just cut off the water. I've seen him do it. The impudence. And the laundress won't clean the clothes without the money. Oh, Mother, I'm down to my last petticoat. Don't bother me about trifles, Letty. Is the tea ready? I'm expecting young Mr. Pillin at half past. Oh, him with the high collar, same as yesterday? All right. Mother. What? That young man. You've asked him here again? Why not? It's horrible to borrow money from people you hardly know. But you're not going to, I hope. No, but you are. I never knew such ingratitude. I slave for you children. Mother, I won't be a decoy duck. If you borrow from him... They're here. Look at me. Look at me! Maggie, don't open till I'm invisible. Is Mrs. Larne at home? Miss Phyllis is at home, sir. Oh. You've come to see Mother? Well, she invited me. I'm glad she's not here, though. Don't be silly. Sit down. Why do you think mother asked you to come? Well, really, I don't know. Don't tell fibs. You know you've come to lend us some money. Well, supposing I have, it's only to quarter day. Why, anybody might want to borrow... But why are you lending it? Because... because she... Because you thought that I... Oh, that's what's so hateful. Oh, Phyllis, I never. I swear I never. Yes, you did. You thought I wanted you to lend it. Oh, Phyllis, please. Well, I brought the check with me, but if you don't want me to, here goes. There. Oh, Bob. Thank you. Now I suppose she'll try and borrow from that man Ventnor. He's a friend of yours, isn't he? Well, I only just know him. He's mother's lawyer. Mother doesn't mind him, but I think he's a beast. Well, I suppose I'd better go before your mother comes. This may be the last time you'll see me. But I thought you were going to take us to the theater tomorrow night. So I was, but I don't know whether your mother will now. You don't know mother. Look, here she is. Has my naughty girl been making you comfortable, Mr. Pillin? Well, I must just go see about my white petticoat. Our laundress is an awful beast. She will be paid. You really wanted to go to the theater tomorrow? How nice of you. I should've loved it. But, er, come and sit down. We poor bohemians. My dear young man, you can't conceive how we live from hand to mouth. Just imagine, that lovely girl of mine hasn't anything to go in. She is lovely, isn't she? Yes. I can't bear money myself. It's in my blood, I suppose. And yet, you know, sometimes, I don't know where to turn. You're one of those rich young men who owns ships and things, aren't you? Well, my father does. As a matter of fact, we just sold our ships... Oh, how delightful! What a lovely lot of money you must have. My poor ships are all here and here, and they don't sell. Isn't it tragic? Mr. Pillin, do you think you could... Well, I... I say, Bob, shall we have supper before the play or after? Both, don't you think? You awful boy, how dare you? I say, that hurts! I mean it to. Mother, I put him up to it. Well, I give it up. When I'm dead of work and anxiety, you'll both be sorry. Two suppers. I say, you are a topper. Have some toffee. Look out, young man. It's beeswax. Oh, I say! Mr. Heythorp! How you do? Gardy. Oh, how do you do, sir? I saw you at the meeting. How did you come here? Oh, I just blew in. Jock, take Mr. Pillin and show him your white rat. Come on! No. I don't think I quite understand white rat. I won't let him bite you. Come on. Oh! I say, Jock! So you're making up to that young pup, are you? Such a nice young man. We like him ever so. Gardy, I'm sure your coming means good news. Settled ?6,000 on the children. Oh, Gardy! On the children? Yes, on the children. You can't blew it, so don't try. Oh, how unkind, as if I... Scriben the lawyer will pay you the income until they come of age or marry, ?60 a quarter. Don't ask questions. Not a word to anyone. No, Gardy, of course not. How about young Pillin? She's not to be grabbed up by any fool who comes along. The dear girl is much too young. He's quite harmless, Gardy. A nice, simple fellow. Drop him. Oh. And not a word of this settlement to anyone. No, Gardy. But I'm so pressed. Could you let me have ?25 in advance? No. Quarter day. Phyllis, will you get Gardy his tea? I've forgotten something, I must just telephone. Gardy, will you excuse me, please? Tea, Gardy? Okay, thank you. What in the name of... What is this thing? Gee-whiz! Crumpets! Lucky Jock didn't know. Was our dad like Jock? Mother's always so mysterious about him. I suppose you knew our dad's father quite well. Yes. He was a man about town in my day. Oh, you're day must have been jolly. Did you wear pink top trousers and Don Gerry whiskers? What luck. I suppose you had lots of adventures with opera dancers. Oh, do ya? Well, young men are all so good now. That young man for instance is a perfect stick of goodness. But he's going to take us to the theater tomorrow night. Oh, is he? Yes. It's Valentines Day, you know. And he's going to give us two suppers. Won't it be lovely? Only I haven't got anything to go in. Isn't money horrible, Gardy? If only one could put out a plate overnight and have just enough in the morning to use during the day. Gardy! Little present for ya. Oh! Buy yourself a dress, and don't tell your mother. ?10! How lovely! You are a toot. Gardy, you have the grand manner. Why do you look at me like that? You know, you're more like your father. Listen. When you come of age, you'll have ?120 a year of your own. Oh! Yes. And don't ever be persuaded to do anything you don't want. And don't marry a fool for his money. And remember, your mother's a sieve. No use giving her anything. You keep what you'll get for yourself. It's only a pittance. You'll need it. Every penny. Mothers a darling, really, Gardy. Oh, I dare say. Only one thing in life matters... Independence. You lose that, you lose everything. Get old like me, you'll find that out. Keep your independence. It's the only value of money. And chaps like that young pup are fools! Help me up. Oh! I'm off. Oh, Gardy. What a whopper. You must have a big head. They're all so small now. I shall marry someone with a head like yours. Hmm! Oh, must you go? I do love you to come. I do so love you altogether. That's right. You be a good girl. Don't tell your mother what I've been saying. I'm to enjoy my dinner tonight. Well, don't you always? I always think of you as having such a good dinner. You look like it, you know. Oh. Well, I've got a daughter. Mustn't eat, mustn't drink, always at me. Yes. We saw her in the distance. She looked too good for anything. That's the trouble. Is she married? No. Why not? Too holy. He's coming in. What? Gardy, will you take that young man away with you in your cab? What?! Here! I don't want the young pup! I'm off. I'll give you a lift. You're going my way. Well, sir, I wasn't thinking of... Oh, yes, he is, Gardy. He is! Er, thanks, then. Make the most of your opportunities, I see. I don't know what you mean, sir. Mrs. Larne is very kind. Ah, no doubt. Don't try and pick the flowers. That's all. Are you a relative of theirs, sir? Yes. Oh, then I quite understand what you mean. But I should like to know what your objection to me is. Milk and water masquerading as port wine. Give me my stick. Gardy, are you going? A good day to you. Er, Letty? The door. What is that thing you've got there? Hmm? What is it for? Huh? What do you... what do you do with it? Keep your nose warm, huh? Ooh! Come here. What do you think of that? Gardy! Ooh! Ooh! That's for you. That's for me. Ooh! Well, Father, are you going to keep to this absurd idea of dining alone in future, giving twice the trouble? I am going out tonight, so it doesn't matter. But I do hope that by tomorrow you will feel more sociable. It looks so bad. Cupid, with nothing on, not even a quiver. "To be your valentine." Hmm. Perfume. "Dear Gardy, I'm sorry this is such a mangy valentine. I'm especially excited about the theater tonight. Good-bye, darling. Your own Phyllis." So they don't call you Grandfather? I'm afraid I feel relieved. Did my mother know about this sort of thing? No. How fortunate. She could've stood it. Is that a sneer or a statement? Your mother was hard as wood, just like you. Well, really, Father. Be good enough to leave my letter alone. Now, Father, please don't get into these rages. Who ever had you, granddaughter? Who ever put you in the position you are? They tell me you have the manners of the old school. Where do you keep them? You put my back up. I'm sorry. Are you going to take a holiday, as Dr. Summers advised? No. Are you going at least to stop drinking port? No. Carpe diem, live while I can. You know that any day you might have apoplexy. Ah. Sooner I've done with it than turned it over. There's only one word for it... pagan. If you can't think of this life, you might of the next. When they're roasting me, you'll be able to say, "I told you so." Profanity as usual. Let me alone, then! As if I could. Would you like a hand up, sir? No. Just come. Er, by hand, sir. Send me Molly. Yes, sir. Yes, sir? I want to look at you. I am not tidy, sir. Take the taste out of me mouth. Can't bear sour faces. I like pretty ones. Any Valentines? No, sir. Who would be sending me one? Haven't you got a young man? Well, I might. But he's over in my country. Well, what do you think of that? Indeed, and it's pretty, too. Like to keep it? If it's not taking it from you, sir. Little present for you. Oh, sir. A sovereign! It's too much. It's kingly. When I was young, I was fond of an Irish girl. And wouldn't that be the pleasure of her? Blarney. No. I didn't know me luck. The luck? Ah, 'tis a chancy thing. Yes. If you get any, stick to it. I will, sir. I'm going to ask you to do something for me as a human being. Sure, and I'll do anything you like. Stick your nose in here every now and then. I can't get up without a hand, don't like ringing. Can't bear feeling dependent, understand me? Oh, and I do, when you, so active in your brain, and such a grand gentlemen. 'Tis an honor, it is. I'll be putting me nose in here all the time, I will. Much obliged, dear. Would you be also wanting anything else, sir? Could I be pulling on your feet or any trifle? No, thank ya. Could I be bringing you your tea or a bottle of anything? No, thank you. Tell me. Have I got bad manners? Oh, sir, no. 'Tis lovely manners you have, the real old manners. Thank you. You're a good girl. It's proud you make me, sir. Ah. That's a lady. A ruffian. Mr. Farney, sir. Good afternoon, sir. Great change in the weather. Quite spring-like. I brought you the purchase deed to sign for the company. Pillin has signed already. Only thing to come in here this evening, Mr. Farney. Four sound ships for ?60,000. Ah. Conscience clear on that. Great stroke of business, I feel. Have you heard from that shareholder called Ventnor? No, sir. Well, I have. Just write for me, will ya? Charles Ventnor, Esquire. 12 Faucet Street. Sir, I have your letter of even date, the contents of which I am at a loss to understand. My solicitors will be apprised of it. Yours truly. Little ruffian. Can I do anything, sir? Yes. Get back to the office. And drop that in on him as you go. That letter will bring him round here if I'm not very much mistaken. May I take this opportunity, sir, of saying how much I've admired the way you got this purchase through in spite of all the opposition. In fact, sir, in the office, we all swear by you. Hmm, thank you, Mr. Farney. It's a pleasure to hear. I don't know if you've ever heard your nickname in Liverpool. Old English. Personally, I think it's a proud one. Aequam memento, Mr. Farney. Rebus in arduis servare mentem. What's that, sir? Keep a stiff upper lip. I suppose there isn't much of Old England left as you remember it, sir. Eh. The breed goes on. It's in the bones. Yes, sir, but there isn't much meat on it nowadays. Ah. I bought that picture in '59, before I was married. Never get married, Mr. Farney. Lose your independence. I'm afraid I have lost it, sir. Can't say I ever had much. Only thing in life, heel on your neck, no matter whose, better dead. You must've had a good life, sir. Lasted out all me old cronies, every man, except Joe Pillin. Huh. You can't call Joe Pillin alive. Careful fellows, too, some of them. Oh well. Little bit longer, I hope. I hope you'll live for many years. The ship wouldn't be the same without you. Thank you, Mr. Farney. Much obliged to you. Good day to you. Good day, sir. Give that fellow my letter. Yes, sir. Fond of me. What a whisk. A young lady to see you, sir. Young lady? A Miss Larne. Ask her to come in. Hello, Phyllis. I've bought my dress for the night, Gardy. It's a darling. Do you like irises? My favorite scent. Oh, what luck. Somehow I thought you would. Shall I put them in water, sir? Very partial to water, the irises. Oh, teetotalists. Oh, I say. This is a jolly room. You've had real adventures, haven't you? Adventures must be lovely. Not for young ladies. You know, Gardy, you can't love anybody who isn't a little bad. You were never too good, I'm sure. Human being. That means you've had some jolly laughs. Come here. Enjoy yourself, but remember, the world's hard, lots of ruffians, always on the look out. I know. There's a man who comes to see mother. He makes me squirm. But we had laughs with him yesterday after you'd gone. Yes. We heard him being insulting to mother. And Gardy, that young man, he's got more sand than you'd think. You should have heard him say, "Out you go." Once, twice, and out he did go. I wish he hadn't. Then Bob could've knocked him down. Bob? Well, that's his name. He really had quite a nice glare in his eye. Well, who was this other chap, this visitor chap? Mother's lawyer. Ventnor, he's called. He is? Oh, yes, you know him, don't you? I do. So he came to see her yesterday? What about? Oh, money. Gardy, I've been thinking about what you told me. It would be lovely to have money of my own. I think it's splendid of you, because I know you're not well off. Poor as a church mouse. I adore your expressions. They're real Old English. I love your name, too. Sylvanus. Means "made of wood," doesn't it? Not quite. Name in my family old as the hills. When I go, it goes. Don't, Gardy. Can't stop it now. Never mind. Stick 'em up as long as we can. Give me a kiss. I've got a little cold. Don't catch cold at my age. Haven't the time. We shall have awful laughs tonight, Gardy. Remember, bread and butter with independence better than champagne with a fool. Yes, only, somehow, I don't think Bobby's a fool, exactly. I think he's just been too well brought up. Were you ever in love, Gardy? I mean, really and truly? Did you marry her? Why not? Ask no questions, you'll be told no lies. No. Only... only, I have got a sort of feeling that... Well? That... Out with it. That you're our grandfather. Quite right. Sorry. Rather not. I think it's awfully jolly. Did she die? Poor Gardy. Found out, then. Serves me right. Well, it's all the same now, isn't it? Here we are. I suppose your daughter doesn't know. Told her yesterday. She's been praying for me every since. Ah, yes, you'd better run along. Excuse me, sir. Could I go out this evening after dinner? Miss Heythorp's going to a ball, sir. A ball? A charity ball, I believe. Ah. Would be. Yes, sir. Anything else, sir? No, thank you. That was the front door, sir. Do you wish to see anybody? A man called Ventnor. No one else. No, sir. Mr. Ventnor, sir. Sorry, I can't get up. Sit down. I got your answer, Mr. Heythorp. Your letter's Greek to me. I can still make it into plain English. The sooner, the better. Very well. Our friend Mr. Pillin paid you a commission of 10 percent on the sale of his ships. What? The money was settled on Mrs. Larne and her children. Your grandchildren, you know. Where'd you get a hold of this cock-and-bull story? It won't do, Mr. Heythorp. My witnesses are Mrs. Larne herself and the lawyer, Scriben. I find that Mr. Pillin made the settlement, but here's the joke, Mr. Heythorp. Mrs. Larne doesn't know Mr. Pillin and Mr. Pillin doesn't know Mrs. Larne. Amusing, isn't it? Doesn't mean anything to me what Joe Pillin does with his money. Easily said, but you see, Mr. Heythorp, you told Mrs. Larne of this settlement. You think you can tell this rigmarole to a meeting? I not only can, but if necessary, I will. You'll get the lie direct. No proof. Pardon me. I have the note from Mrs. Larne to Mr. Pillin's lawyer. There's nothing to connect her with me. Oh? It's well known in Dublin that her late husband was your natural son. I'll bring an action against you, make you pay for the news. Bluff. It won't do, Mr. Heythorp, and you know it. I've got you. The merest whiff of sticky dealing like this will blow you out of your directorships. You've outstayed your welcome as it is, and this business'll finish you off! If you're going to call this meeting, what did you come here for? Blackmail? Oh, you take that tone, do you? Still think you can ride roughshod. Well, you're very much mistaken. I advise you to keep a civil tongue and consider your position. You... How much do you want? I'm not sure this isn't a case for a prosecution. Gammon! Neither gammon nor spinach! Either you pay me what you owe me at once or I call this meeting and make what I know public. You'll very soon find out where you are, and a good thing, too, for a more unscrupulous... Unscrupulous? Unscrupulous! So you'll bully me, will you? You'll do no good for yourself by getting into a passion. At your age and in your condition, I recommend a little prudence. I'm not to be intimidated by any of your blood. I'm out to show you who's master. You're a cowardly, petty-pocking attorney! Call your meeting! Do your worst! Oh-ho. Blustering out, do you, you miserable old turkey cock, you apoplectic old image? I'll have you off your boards. Not a penny out of me. I'll have you in the gutter. Not a cent. You think you can still domineer? You think you can scare... Well, two can play at that game! Huh. One foot in bankruptcy and one foot in the grave. Oh! No. No, you don't. Ah. That showed you, hasn't it? Well, it's never too late to learn. For once, you've come up against someone a little bit too much for you, haven't you now? You shouldn't have called me names. I don't want to be too hard on you. I'm only trying to show you that you can't play the almighty any longer. You've had your own way for too many years and now you can't have it. See? That's all. If I were... Now, don't get into a passion again. Ah, that's better. I see you'll come round. But mind you, this is your last chance. I'm a man of my word, and what I say, I do. Now, then, are you going to pay me? So you want to be ruined, then? Sir, what's the matter? Show this hound out. So that's it, is it? Your hat, sir. Very well, Mr. Heythorp. Very well. Hope he hasn't hurt you, sir. O... open the window. Quick. Let the smell of the fellow out. Help me up. Lost my temper. Mistake. That's better. Get me a hot bath. And put some pine stuff in it. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir, but, er, did that fellow threaten you? Bullied me. Can I do anything about it, sir? I'm pretty handy with the gloves. No, no. Trifle. Gave me an appetite. Tell the cook I want a good dinner tonight. I will, sir. Get up a bottle of the '68 port. Yes, sir. Put out my evening clothes. Really, sir? Why not? No, indeed, sir. Let's have a bottle of Penaj?ia. Yes, sir. What's the menu? Julienned soup, sir, filet de sole... And a sweetbread. Cutlet soubise. And a sweetbread. Sweetbread, cutlet soubise, and rum souffl?. And tell cook to get me some oysters. And put on a savory. Yes, sir. Then, er, what time shall I turn on the bath, sir? 7:00. I'll have me nap now. Yes, sir. Shall I turn out the light, sir? Cooked me own goose. Well... Fill up. These are the special glasses, sir. It would fall to the bottom. And fill up! Buzz the bottle before the sweet. Good wine. I've prepped it just a little, sir. What's this? Ooh, souffl?. There's an old... An old fur coat in the wardrobe. No further use for it. Take it for yourself. Thank you, sir. It'll o-o-only get moths. It's got it, sir. I'm afraid I've given you a lot of trouble. Oh, no, sir. That is, er, no more than reason, sir. Well, can't help it. And get old like me, you'll find that out. I've always admired your pluck, sir, keeping the flag flying. Much obliged to you. Cook's done a cheese ramekin, sir. Hmm. Hello, Molly. Smells good. It's very hot, sir. Shall I take it out of the case? Um, here. Touch of cayenne. Yes, sir. Molly, my compliments to cook. Capital dinner. Yes, sir. I'll have my port with this. Excuse me, sir, but, er, after a bottle of champagne, are you sure you ought to? No, but I'm going to. Do you mind if I ask Miss Heythorp, sir? If you do, you can leave my service. Well, sir, I don't accept the responsibility. Who asked you to? I'm not a baby. No, sir. Well, get it, then. Hmm. The... Huh. Pull me up. Now, put the decanter out, here. Guv'nor isn't off doing it tonight. What he'll be like tomorrow, I don't know. Ah, let him have his pleasure. Shall I cut your cigar, sir? Hmm. What is that squealing? I think it's Miss Heythorp singing, sir. Oh! Cat. Ever hear Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale? Beg pardon, sir? Oh, of course, you weren't born. Mario, Grisi, old Lablache. Great days of opera, those. I'm sure, sir. Theater, too. Old Kemble. Power. Little Robson. Little Robson. I once saw Edmund Kean. Indeed, sir. Would that be a relation of the present Edmund Kean, sir? Who's he? On the hall, sir. The great ventriloquist. Oh, my. I saw Hermit win his derby. Did you indeed, sir? Mm-hmm. All foreign hands, then. Tandems, gigs. Drove me own cab, tiger behind. Those were little boys, weren't they, sir? Little rascals in boots, new liveries, tight as a drum. Your cigar, sir. Wet sheet and a flowing tide. Great days, all gone. Smoke. Your coffee, sir. Get me the old brandy. Brandy, sir? I really daren't. Bunkum. You'll forgive me, sir, but if Miss Heythorp heard you... Are you my servant or hers? Yours, sir, but the doctor told us... Hang the doctor. Get the brandy. Mother's milk. Large glass. I want to swing it round, get the aroma. Pour it out. You said I might go out, sir, but perhaps I'd better stay. Why? Where I dines, I sleeps. Ever hear of jollicks? No, sir. Oh, my grandmother's wig. Yes, sir. I'll be back before 11:00, sir. I won't give that cur a chance. Father, Meller has let out that you're drinking brandy after champagne and port. That's absolute poison. It will kill you. Really, one would think you had no self-control at all! I don't know whether I ought to go out. Why not? I'm perfectly well. If it were not for charity, I wouldn't. Oh, no! If you behave like a baby, you must be treated like one. What? And I tell you plainly, if you go on like this, I won't have liquor in the house. So you'll bully me too, do you? Good night. Not so fast, my lady. Not under your heel until... tomorrow. Bully me, would she? Last night to call me soul my own. What's the matter? No feeling! No hands! Never say die. Done it! Take it away from me, would she? And get me down, will they? Never! What's this? Red. All red. Tomorrow... Tomorrow. It's very late, you know. It's half past 11:00. I'm afraid it's too late for you to see him now. He's asleep. Well, I won't wake him unless he happens to... but I did want to show him my dress. Well, that's a fact, miss. It wouldn't matter if you did wake him. He's got to go to bed. Bob, hold my cloak. Oh, is it free? Oh, not quite. It's the pin. I'm so afraid of hurting you. Let it rip. Oh! Great Scott, did I... All serene. Gardy? My dress, Gardy. He is fast asleep, isn't he? I'll just put this in his buttonhole. When he wakes, won't he jump? Good night, Gardy. Bless you. Oh, I do wish he'd wake. He'll be so sorry he didn't see my dress. I'll wake him. Mr. Heythorp. Mr. Heythorp. Is he awake? No. I must just try again. No. Not here. Come along. Oh, my. Aren't we strong? Sir. Sir! Bedtime, sir! That gentleman's right. He's not breathing. Feel his forehead. It's cold as ice. No, no. Surely he's never... Gone. A grand old fighting gentleman. Oh. A great old sinner he was.
