[instrumental music] [instrumental music] [Mingo] What did you do? What did you do, Billy? Billy, look at me. Why did you do this? -[Mingo] Why did you do this? -[Rachel] I'm calling the cops! -[Rachel] Get away from us! -[Mingo] Get back here, Rachel! Get back here! Rachel! -[Mingo] Rachel, get back here! -[panting] [intense music] [pounding on door] [Mingo] Open the door! Rachel, open the door now! Open the damn door! Help. I need help. [man on PA] Dr. Yoder. Dr. Stanley Yoder, please call Emergency. Mr. and Mrs. Chandler, thank you so much for taking the time to learn more about emergency care at Children's Hospital and for your interest in the new helipad so that injured patients can be brought in safely and swiftly. [woman on PA] Dr. Wilcox, return to Emergency. Dr. Wilcox, incoming medevac. [stretcher rattling] Dr. McCullen, Surgery, please. Dr. McCullen. [door opens, shuts] You know what, let's keep moving. Um, the doctor should take care of it. Honey, did you see that? That was so scary. Like I said, this is why it's important for us to have the helipad, so patients like that have a chance. So, did the Chandlers pull out their checkbooks? Well, if they don't make a donation after what we saw today, I don't think they ever will, no matter how many pretty pictures you draw for them. Hey. You hold it right there, missy. I do not draw pretty pictures. I create art that inspires feelings and emotions. -Wow! -It's called passion. Well, they got a dose of real feelings in the emergency room today, so we shall see. Fingers crossed. [cell phone beeps] [sighs] Margaret wants to see me. -[sighs] How lovely. -[chuckles] -Good luck. -Thanks. I need it. [Margaret] Okay, come on, just do it. Come in! They just air-lifted a kid in. -I know. I was there. -How did the Chandlers take it? -I think it shook them. -Good. Then they'll be ready when we make the ask. Sit. So I just got all the info on the little boy from Ellen Graham in Social Work. -Child abuse case. -Child abuse? Yes. And we're gonna use this as an opportunity. I want you to write a story for the annual report on abuse centered around this little boy. You know, how the hospital steps in, saves kids when their own parents do them harm. It's gonna bring in a lotta bucks and it's gonna be a great break-out story for you. -Was it a parent? -Stepfather. [monitor beeping] All right, we're gonna take this jacket off. [telephone ringing] Well, well, well, I see you made it through the Margaret meeting unscathed. Yup. She scares me. Well, that's 'cause you're new here. She'll grow on you. Well, at least I think she will. She wants me to do a story on child abuse, says it could be my break-out story, whatever that means. Well, maybe there's something there you can use in your creative writing class. Yeah, child abuse? It's a great topic. Well, look at it this way. If it's uncomfortable, that means it's challenging and an opportunity to grow. And if you're scared, all the more reason to do it. -Okay, Gandhi. -I'm gonna go outside. And, uh, draw these, uh, pretty little pictures. -You do that. -I will. -Bye. -Bye. -[line ringing] -[door shuts] Hey, do you have a direct number to Ellen Graham at Social Work? [woman on PA] David, telephone, please. Jenny? Hi. Ellen Graham. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. I'm sorry, I thought they would have transferred the patient from the ER by now, but, unfortunately, he's not a candidate for surgery because he's currently comatose and his chances of survival are extremely bleak. You okay? I, um, just don't get up to the floors much, especially the ICU. Yeah. It's not for the faint of heart. -Pediatrics, please. -I'll be fine. So Margaret really wants this story. She can't remember the last time we did something on abuse, and it's important that we write about it. Oh, it is, Billy is just one of the many abused children out there without a voice, so let's give him one. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Okay. Hey! You never come up here. Guess it's my lucky day. -What's up? -I'm writing a story on Billy. Billy? That little, little boy in there. Billy. Right. Are we still on for dinner? Yeah. Okay, then. Jenny, can you come in here? I'd like you to meet Billy's primary care nurse. Yeah. [Ellen] Beth, this is Jenny Carlyle. She's from Community Relations. Jenny, I think you should include people like Beth in your story, the caregivers on the front line. And Beth is one of the best. Do we have a prognosis? We'll know more in a few days. At this point it's a waiting game. What are you writing about? Um, it's centered around the importance of getting these kids into medical care quickly. If it weren't for the medevac, he could have died. [Ellen] Let's just hope it was quick enough for Billy. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] I'm sorry I'm late. So... You were up in the ICU earlier today for the child abuse case. Yeah. Billy. I'm writing a story about him. Oh, that's great. A real story. Not another one of those about, uh, grandmas knitting bonnets for newborns. It wasn't grandmas. And that is not all I write about. You know what I mean, 'cause people are more likely to read a story about an abuse case. It's hardcore, real-life. Who knows, maybe a publisher might read it, offer you a better job. Well, I like my job. Plus, I get to see you all the time. -[chuckles] -How was your day? Oh, well, had to teach a new resident how to stitch up a cut on a screaming kid. Sad. How do they not teach you this stuff in medical school? How do you do it every day? Seeing kids in pain all the time. It's the job. It is hard, but you get used to it. Uh, for example, earlier today I had a nine-year-old that was stroking out. It's very hard to see that happening with a kid. But I just had to stay focused on the situation and not get emotional. Is he okay? Uh, didn't make it. Oh! Look, they have 2000 Chateau Petrus. Let's order that. You know what? I, um, I need to use the bathroom. And I'm in the mood for a white. [sighs] -To the best writer I know. -I am the only writer you know. Jenny, you don't want a boring white. You want this Chateau Petrus because it's bold and complex, just like you. Are you saying I'm complicated? -Okay. It's really good. -Only the best for my best. -[glasses clinking] -Bon appetit. [Jenny] Here at Children's Hospital we care deeply about the well-being of innocent children who get caught in the crossfires of domestic abuse, especially with stories like Billy's. By dedicating premier facilities and resources like the helipad, we can ensure quick access to critical treatment that can save more young lives. Jenny, this is too stale. -It's impersonal. -It's based on facts. Well, we need more than facts, okay? We need heart, we need purpose, we need to provoke a tsunami-like wave of empathy. Okay, do you want me to start over? No, we, we have something better in mind. What? What is it? A new perspective. Yes, it's called the Auntie program, where the auntie serves as the surrogate parent without any legal authority. You would sit and read and you'd be there for any painful medical procedures, that kind of thing. I know all about it. I did a story on it last year. Oh, well, then that's great because Billy needs an auntie. And Margaret thinks it should be you. Um, that's insane. Why? Because that way you can tell Billy's story from the inside out. Of course, we'll change the details so we have to, to protect his privacy, but think about it, you could tell an abuse story, but with a whole new fresh, unique perspective. And I'll-I'll give you time off to cover your auntie hours. Okay. Is this even ethical? I mean, it feels like we're using this little boy purely for the sake of this story. Jenny, it's important. We need to get media coverage to get the helipad, we need those big donations pouring in. This is gonna help save a lot of other kids, right? -Yes. Yes, I agree. -It's the right thing to do. Okay, now you already have your security clearance. This is one issue from last year when you did the auntie story, so you're good to go. And, Jenny, give me your best. -Okay? I'm counting on you. -Okay. Are you sure you're up for this? Well, it does not look like I have a choice. And I need to write this article. It's five hours a week, rain or shine. Yeah. Margaret said she'd give me the time off. Sure, but she'll forget about that when you're on a big deadline. Or some big donor comes and needs a visiting, you have to take him on a long tour. You're going to have to see him struggle the way a young child should never, ever have to struggle. Sometimes they never wake up. You could be standing next to that bed for months. Maybe a year. There may come a time when someone has to make a decision about letting him go, and you are the only non-medical person spending time with Billy. The only one not poking and prodding him. He's basically asleep. What could he need? Someone who truly gives a damn. I don't care about your story. What I care about is your commitment to Billy. Come hell or high water, he needs that. Do you understand me? Yeah. [Beth] Pay attention to his heart rate. Notice it goes down when you hold his hand or talk to him. He needs you to do both. Talking is important. But touch is really the essential ingredient. Thought I would just sit with him. -Read him a story or two. -Oh, no. Touch is essential for children to heal. Is there a problem? -No. -Okay, great. [monitor beeping] [vocalization] Hi, Billy. I'm Jenny. I'm going to be your auntie. At Hanover House we are not here to merely give you criticism on your writing. We're here to be your guides, you know, to help you tap in to your unconscious creativity. A-and many of you, even if you've been writing for a while, have probably never come close to diving into the reservoir of all that lies within you. On that note, I do have your grades from last week's paper. -You hate it. -I think you could do better. Okay. I think the issue is not so much your writing as your depth of experience. I mean... What I'm sensing is that you've never really had, uh... How do I say this? Put yourself on the line for anything. You know, Hemingway went to war. You know, Virginia Woolf laid bare the entire workings of her psyche. Yeah, and then they killed themselves. [scoffs] You need to go deeper. You know, find something you truly care about, what scares you. Write about that. "I'm not here to give you criticism. I'm here to be your guide to your creative unconsciousness." He told you to go deeper, right? He means go darker. And he hates anything that's the least bit funny. And I thought yours was super funny. -Sallie Peterson. -Jenny Carlyle. Good to meet you. You actually read my piece? Well, yeah, I thought that's why we had to make a half a dozen copies, so everybody could give feedback. Yeah, but nobody actually does. No, I do. And yours was the best. Don't let him make you think any differently. Well, now I feel like a jerk for not reading yours. -No. Don't worry about it. -What was it about? A satire comparing our world leaders to the expiring produce aisle. -Wow. -Yeah. Well, now I'm definitely gonna read it. I bet you will, and you're gonna enjoy it. [chuckles] [telephone ringing] -Coffee break? -I can't. Margaret wants me to take some pictures up on the ICU. So you're really signed up to be that little boy's auntie, huh? -Yeah. -What is it? Here I am, working at a Children's Hospital and I am terrified of sick kids. Well, yeah, I mean, nobody likes to see sick kids. It's more than that. [Margaret] Are you still here? -I'm leaving right now. -Okay. And, Ray? Don't I need to have those visuals of the helipad, ASAP? This isn't my desk. Oh, my God, I'm so confused. Yes, Margaret, I'm on it right away. [instrumental music] -[camera clicks] -[monitor beeping] [door shuts] Ahem. This is good, this one. That's what we should use. His identity is covered by all those bandages, can't tell what kid it is, so... Yeah. Hey. Try not to get sucked in. You got to keep your emotions in check with these kids. Especially with this one, right? Keep a professional distance. -I could do that. -Good. 'Cause if you can't, I'm gonna have to assign this to someone who can. [laptop keys clacking] -Is this Billy? -Yeah. Poor kid. How you doin'? As good as I can be. I just wanna let you know, I think you're doing a good thing. Brave. Nobody else... would do what you're doing. -Thanks. -He deserves that. [monitor beeping] So this is all new for me. I got you this stuffed animal. Do you wanna name him? How about Billy Bobcat? And every time I pet him... he's gonna help you feel better. Hey. Oh. Sorry, didn't mean to scare you like that. But, uh, your boyfriend keeps calling the office, and I guess your phone's turned off. And he's trying to cancel your date tonight. I was the only one there, so I kinda had to deal with it. Okay. What do you even see in him? -What? -John Dupont Wilcox III. Um, it's the richest family around and they, they don't let anybody forget about it. Okay, first of all, you don't know him. And second of all, it's none of your business, is it? Yeah. No, hey, you're right. It's not. -See ya. -Yeah, see ya. [dramatic music] [monitor beeping] [camera clicking] How'd they steal your pictures? -Um, those are not my photos. -[scoffs] They even got the dad in here, "The Face of Child Abuse." You know, they should have the headline over his picture. -He's the face of child abuse. -So we know where the mom is? No, no one knows. Poor thing. You know what happens to the women in these situations. You know what it was, some tabloid sleaze came in here and took these pictures. [gasps] We're gonna use that to our advantage. Try this, not only did Billy get beaten up by the stepdad, but then some creepy tabloid photographer takes his pictures and sells them to the press. Huh? People are gonna be doubly mad. Bet you we got checks in the mail by morning. [dramatic music] [humming] That's pretty. You never sing like that for me. How's the auntie thing going? You know, it's not what I expected. Every second I'm not with him, all I think about is him waking up. Well, his numbers have drastically improved from the ones on the chart. Oh, that's great. Jenny, don't get too close. It's nice what you're doing, but this... There's no guarantee there's gonna be a happy ending. Just gotta give you that reality check every once in a while. Just don't over-extend yourself with this kid. You gotta take care of yourself first. I know that I can't effectively save lives if I don't have that boundary. And look, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a hard lesson I've learned over the years, but it's important. I'll call you later. Here we have a six-year-old airlifted one week ago from Cedar County. Multiple contusions, twisting fracture of the humerus, concussion, some brain tissue continuing to push through the cranial sinus. Comatose since admission. So who thinks these injuries might be from a car accident? If you raised your hand, you are wrong. And if you'd been paying attention, you would know that. [groans] That hurts, doesn't it? The twisting fracture of the humerus is a clear giveaway. Jack, can I talk to you? Just take notes. Billy's improving, and I feel like having all these people here might stress him out. [woman on PA] Dr. Baker, Pediatrics, please. Dr. Baker. You're telling me what to do in front of my residents? You have no authority to tell me what to do in this hospital. I have a job, a responsibility. I can't play favorites for these rounds simply for your attachment to this kid. Look, your story might be important. I mean, you're writing about saving lives, but we're the ones actually doing it. -Gentlemen, as I was saying... -Jerk. You okay? These doctors and nurses and residents, they're so... clinical. So detached from everything. Well, yeah, I mean, they have to be. You must be talking about your boyfriend. Yeah, the bona fide Ice King himself, yeah. -[knocking on door] -Hm, speak of the devil. Hey. I'm really sorry about today. I, I acted like a total jerk. Yes, you did. Listen, I know you see a case study, but I see a little boy who could possibly have a future. I know. I know. And I, I see both now. You know, the most egregious part of what I did was ignoring the fact that he's growing on you. Please forgive me. Hey, buddy. Tell her to give me another chance. Sorry, buddy. But I think that's up to the lady. Sorry. Can't help you. Let me make it up to you, I made reservations at the Hollenbeck Resort. We can ride horses, we can sit in the hot springs, we can drink champagne. What do you say? I will do nothing but say I'm sorry if that's what I need to do. All you need to do... show these kids that you care. Simple. You got it. -Promise. -[cell phone vibrates] -We good? -Can we finish this later? Yeah, sure. A secret rendezvous. Courtyard, 3 p.m. Okay. Well, Margaret isn't fond of her people dating the docs. Yeah. I know. You know, we've been keeping it really quiet, but I guess she'll know now. -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. How do you keep yourself from getting attached? Oh. You're asking the wrong person. I feel it every time one of these kids is discharged. And it doesn't get any easier. You just have to learn to deal with it. Have you heard from the mother? And has she checked on Billy? Um... As far as I know, she hasn't. But that doesn't mean she's not getting updates from his attending physicians like your friend Dr. Wilcox. But is she okay? Was she hurt? I mean, last I heard, no one knows where she is. And when Billy gets better, we have to put him somewhere safe. Somewhere safe, as in foster care? Sometimes that could be worse. And besides, I don't think they will even consider that in this case. We don't know the truth of what happened. And the only one who does is in a coma. I need to know the truth, Ellen. So please help me out here. I'm sorry, Jenny. I can't. To be honest, I can't be talking to you about his mother to this extent, we'll just have to wait and see what happens. I know it's hard. Just be the best auntie you can be. [Billy groans] Billy, honey? Did you say something? One cream, one sugar. Just the way you like it. -Thanks. -Get it while it's hot. What you up to? I am going to find his mother. Where'd you get all that? I broke into Ellen's file cabinet. Look, his mother needs to know what's happening to her baby. She's probably hidden away somewhere 'cause of what happened with the stepfather. If I was her, it'd kill me not to know. What if you don't like what you find out? It doesn't matter if I like it or not. It's the only lead I have to help him. Every child deserves a chance. You know, a real shot at life. I gotta go. I'll see you later. Hey. I had a few minutes before my next donor tour. I was sure I heard him make a sound earlier. -What kind of sound? -Oh. Nothing to be worried about. We're looking for signs that he's coming out of his coma. Making a sound or shifting in his bed, stuff like that. Unfortunately, nothing has changed. Except for his heart rate. It started coming down the minute you walked in. I think he knows you're here. This could mean he's starting to become aware of things. [Jenny] You can do it, Billy. I believe in you. [line ringing] [Rachel on voicemail] Hi! You've reached the Mingo household. We're not in right now, but we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Thanks. Sorry, sorry, Dr. Houser was on this, this spiel about kids and kidney disease, and I told-- I don't think we should do this anymore. Is it because I, I can't be as soft as you want me to be? I told you, I-I can't be emotional with these kids. It's not about being emotional. It's about having empathy, compassion. I mean, don't you remember what got you in this field in the first place? You wanted to help these kids. And now they die, and you go to dinner and order a bottle of wine. I can't justify being with someone who constantly has this wall up. This auntie thing has really changed you. Maybe it has. Take care of yourself. I have to go. [Jenny] People talk about their younger years, playing with the kids next door, ice cream with your parents. Sitting with Billy, wrapped in bandages, attached to beeping machines, I daydream about a life like that for him... and wonder about his dreams. Has he escaped into his favorite adventure? Is he sailing the high seas as we all wait anxiously for his recovery? And what tears my heart is the uncertainty of how long he'll be here... in this reality that no child should ever experience. What's that? It's the new helipad. I mean... I mean, it doesn't even look like it. I think it looks great. Or not. Hey, I was wondering if you would read a short story I wrote on Billy. It's just about all my thoughts on what happened this week. I would really love your input-- Yeah, I can't right now. Okay. [Ray] You're wasting your time with him. -Excuse me? -Just face the facts. He's not coming out of that coma. -You don't know that. -Yeah. But you're the one who wants to be a writer, expose the truth. Well, you need to see the truth in order to do that. Open your eyes, Jenny. The truth? The kids here could do a better job. [instrumental music] Send them to the... [unintelligible] Yeah. Okay, I hope I haven't just made a deal with the devil, but I've agreed to let a few reporters in here. You guys are gonna take 'em on a short tour, so you can talk about the plans for the new helipad. Ray, bring copies of the helipad sketch you showed me this morning, okay? And, Jenny, they're probably gonna ask way too many questions about little Billy, so you just keep steering them back to the helipad. Steer 'em back, steer 'em back. All right, I can't be late for this meeting with the Hospital Commission. But I will be back as soon as possible. Something wrong? -No. -No. Okay, look, whatever it is, I need you to let it go. Okay? 'Cause we're this close to getting serious buzz on the helipad issue, I don't need anything screwing it up. -Understand? -Yeah. They're gonna be here around 2:00. Whittleson's been apprised. He says he's gonna handle it himself. Oh, and I don't want you letting this group out of your sight. Okay? And definitely don't let 'em go near the ICU. You can walk past it, and that's it. Got it? -Got it. -Got it. Good. [Jenny] Okay. [siren blaring] [dramatic music] I think we need to present a united front here. Okay. Would it help if I said I was sorry? Depends. What are you sorry for? For what I said to you. I wanted to hurt you. I was being mean, and I'm sorry. I'll never hurt you again. I promise. You did hurt me. [Jenny] Hi. How are you doing today? [monitor beeping] And later I'll be showing you the courtyard meditation garden funded by the Chandler family. They also just made a very large donation to the new helipad. Now, this helipad is desperately needed to serve the children in our community and beyond. Hey. What do you think you're doing there? Huh? Do you have clearance to be here? Where'd you get this? I'm sorry. Just give me one second. [Ray] Can you escort him out, please? Get him out of here. Get him out. Billy. [intense music] [Jenny] Mr. Mingo, why did you come here knowing there's an order forbidding you from seeing your stepson? I had to see him. Is he gonna be all right? [scoffs] It's really ironic coming from you since you did that to him. [Mingo] It wasn't me. Wasn't me. I knew there was something going on when he had those marks on him last summer. Just didn't wanna believe it. Look, I know I'm not a perfect man. There's things that I've done in the past that I regret and-and I'm-I'm sorry that I did them, but I didn't do this. I love Billy. He's a sweet boy. [sobs] He's my sweet boy. I can never hurt him. God, I wish, sh-should have done something sooner. I should have taken him away from her so he wouldn't have ended up like this. Her? [Mingo sniffles] Mr. Mingo, are you telling me that Rachel did this? That-that she hurt him? Hurt him? She may as well have killed him. "Once upon a time there was pirate named Roxy. She was a fierce leader..." He prefers Peter Rabbit. Jenny, this is Billy's mother, Rachel Lee. -She just got here and she's-- -It's Rachel Lee Mingo. Are you Jenny, the one who called? Yeah. It's so nice to meet you. [Beth] Jenny is Billy's auntie. It's this great program that we-- Is he going to die? We're doing everything we can. He hasn't moved, has he? -No. -So he's going to die. -What's this? -Well... It's something I got for him to, to help comfort him. Maybe I should take you to the conference room and we can talk about what's going on with Billy. No. I wanna be alone with him. All right. Jenny? [dramatic music] I have a bad feeling about this. I don't trust her. -Keep an eye on her, Jenny. -[elevator bell dings] [monitor beeping] [inhales sharply] [indistinct chatter on PA] Ah. Jenny, come quick! You are not gonna believe this. Billy! Hey! Hi. Billy? Billy came out of his coma unable to see. Is he blind? [Jack] He is, but we don't know yet if it's permanent. Hey. Hey, Billy, it's me, Jenny. Where is Billy Bobcat? I'm gonna find him for you. But I did some digging like you asked, but I didn't find much. There's no criminal activity on Rachel's part. It's Mingo's word against hers, and he's not exactly Mr. Clean. Well, now that he's up, we have to try harder. I know. His recovery is gonna go a lot faster now. So you have to prepare yourself to let him go. No, he can't be discharged yet. Jack said that his recovery process is gonna be extremely difficult and they don't even know if he's gonna be able to see. It doesn't matter. If he gets all of his other functions back, they will deal with the blindness later. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. And thank you. I know that bending the rules is not easy for you. Well, you would have done this with or without me. And I only did this to prevent you from rummaging through my files and making a mess again. [chuckling] -Guilty as charged. -Mm-hmm. Hey there, bud. [Billy] Hi, Jenny. Are you feeling a little better? Yeah. Do you wanna stretch your legs out? Because I got you this really cool red cowboy hat. Come on, I'll help you up. Ready? I'm gonna put it on you. It's perfect. I think you should just keep it on all the time. Now we're gonna sit right here and read a book. What do you think about that? Oh, careful. Okay. You comfy? Let's take a break from this guy. And we are gonna read The Tiger In the Trees. -Do you like animals? -I have a dog. -You do? What's his name? -Sammy. Well, that's a really cute name. Where'd you get it from? [clattering in distance] -Bad boy! Bad dog! -O-o-okay. Hey, hey... Hey, you're not a bad boy. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. Shh. It's okay. -[Billy breathing heavily] -It's okay. Oh, it's okay. You're okay. Shh. [woman on PA] Nurse Rodriguez to Pediatrics. Nurse Rodriguez to Pediatrics. Jenny. I just spoke with Billy's mother. Why would she do this? Can she do this? Beth said Rachel's been calling Billy for days now, and all he wants to talk about is his auntie. She doesn't like it. Well, where has she been this whole time? She just doesn't get to walk in here and get rid of me. Well, she's his mother. She can do whatever she wants where he's concerned. Including beating the crap out of him? We don't know that for sure. All we know is what Mr. Mingo says. He's telling the truth. I know it. We can't take that to court and testify. There were three people in the room when that happened. And one of them just woke up blind from a coma. Well, there's no law that says you can't visit him as his friend. I mean, you are his friend now, you know? Maybe the only one he has. Yeah. Maybe I shouldn't try so hard. You know, just let it go. Do you think that's a good idea? No. Just trust you instincts, Jenny. Don't give up on him. [instrumental music] [monitor beeping] [Billy grunting] No, no, no. Someone help! [indistinct chatter] -Call it in. -[Billy groaning] Billy, honey, just lean on to your side. What is happening? What's happening? Stand back, ma'am. Did you do something to my baby? What did you do? Hey! -I was gone for a minute! -Heart rate's dropping. -You need to leave. -Mama's here. [Rachel] I'm right here. Mommy's here. Back up, ma'am, please. Back up. [woman on PA] 199. ICU. Code 199. Intensive Care Unit. -[Rachel] Mommy's here. -Oh, hey, hey, ma'am. -She did something to my baby. -Okay, let's talk about this-- You! You bitch! You did something to my son! [instrumental music] [sighs] He's stabilized. What happened? Can I see him? No. Rachel is convinced you did something to hurt Billy. She's telling anyone who will listen. I would never do that. I need to speak with Jenny alone, please. Listen to me. This thing has taken an ugly turn. But the main thing I need for you to do is to stay away. I'm going to assign Billy a new auntie. Ruth. An older woman, very experienced with difficult parents. So I can't see him? I can't talk to him? You aren't entitled to know anything about him anymore. I'm sorry, Jenny. But I haven't given up hope. But for the time being there's nothing that I or you or anybody else can do. [sighs] [instrumental music] Jenny, what are you doin'? You can't stay here all day. We have work to do. Hello. I, uh, I have a really bad feeling about Billy's mother. Okay, I told you not to get involved in that little boy's case. Didn't I? -Someone needs to protect him. -No, no, no. What you need to do is you need to let Ellen Graham handle this, because you could get suspended from work for getting involved in patient matters that are none of your business. You understand? I'm not asking you, Jen, I'm telling you. You step back. Okay? -Yes. -Okay. Finish up your coffee. And let's get back to work, you got that tour with the Millers at 1:00. You up for that? -Yeah. -Okay, good. See you upstairs. Mr. and Mrs. Miller, this is our Intensive Care Unit. It is where our most serious cases are treated and where your gift will have the greatest impact. I would love to introduce you to one of our most experienced ICU nurses, Beth Randall. Beth, will you explain to the Millers why the ICU plays such a critical part in the work we do here? Uh, of course. Aside from having one of the premier... I got you something. You okay? [Jenny sighs] Billy, say something. Bad boy. I'm a bad boy. Jenny, what are you doing? You have to take the Millers somewhere else. You shouldn't be here. Beth, he's hurt. He needs me. Look, why don't you meet me in Ellen's office after my shift? We can talk to her together. Okay. You hang in there, sweetheart. I'm gonna make sure no one ever hurts you again. You're firing me. You went against my direct order not to visit that child. Your job was to write a story, Jenny. -Where is that story by the way? -It's not ready yet. I'm taking it in a new direction. You know, I was afraid that this whole thing might cloud your judgment, and it has. I've had reports from the unit, I had a complaint from the mother. The mother is the one who did that to him. You crossed the line, Jenny. She's threatening to sue the hospital. Are you listening to yourself? He could die if he stays with her. I'm not gonna abandon him. He is not your concern. He's not your child. Whose is he? Margaret, whose child is he? Who gives a damn about what happens to him, huh? You can take this. [door opens, shuts] [instrumental music] [Ray] Margaret wanted me to give you this. There's actually some cash in there, if you can believe it. But it's her way of showing that she cares. Anyways, I thought it was a good excuse to come see how you're holding up. And thought maybe this might help. -You know me so well. -Are you gonna be okay? Ah, yeah, I'll be fine. I just... don't really know what's next. Well, I'll tell you what's next. You are gonna focus on your writing. Mm, I don't see the point of that. Jenny, you have to finish the article. Yeah, maybe. Cheers. Thank you. Hey, what's the story behind that? I, uh, I grew up in the foster care system since I was five or six. I don't really remember much of my childhood before that. But this is all that came with me. It's the only evidence I have that... I belonged. Or maybe I just imagined that I did. I was simply told when I was old enough that they left, that my dad died, or maybe it was my mom. Don't think anyone ever told me the truth. Or maybe they, maybe they didn't know. What I knew was that no one wanted me. And I grew up believing that it was somehow my fault. But what I do know is that this kid has a chance to have a life that I never thought I deserved. Jenny... he is so lucky to have you. To have someone who truly loves him. [cell phone ringing] -Hello? -[Beth] Jenny, it's Beth. I hope I don't regret this, but... I got a day pass to take Billy out tomorrow. The doctors want him to get some fresh air. We'll be at Foster's Park near the hospital, northeast corner by the ice-cream stand at 2 p.m. I will be there. Thank you, Beth. I can see Billy tomorrow. Do you wanna join us at the park? Of course. Okay. [sighs] Thanks for this. I'm lookin' forward to it. [instrumental music] -How's the ice cream? -It's good. -Like, really good? -Really good. [chuckles] Are you gonna share with the dog? Yeah. Here, he could have mine. Billy looks so happy with Jenny. Doesn't he? Congratulations on your fellowship, by the way. Paris. Wow, that's exciting. Yeah. Thanks. When do you go? Next week. [chuckles] Ice cream on his nose. What's next week? Oh, I forgot to tell you last night. I wanted to tell you, but, um... I got accepted into a fellowship program in Paris. Ray, that's incredible. -Congratulations. -Thanks. Uh, Margaret's losing two of her key players. Yeah, and she's also losing her mind. Not that we didn't already know that. Well, it's amazing news. -I'm really happy for you. -Thank you. -I have to go to the bathroom. -Oh, um... -I can take him. -Great. -Will you go with Ray? -Yeah. Got it. Come on, buddy. Come with me. This way. He's in love with you, you know? Well, it doesn't matter. Paris is his future. Not me. [instrumental music] -Okay, you wanna feed 'em? Okay. -Okay. [indistinct chatter] Well, I gotta get goin'. Okay, well, don't be a stranger. I won't. You know, if you fail, you could always beg Margaret for your job back. [chuckles] What good is that when my favorite co-worker isn't there to give me hell? I mean, who do I even have coffee with? Margaret? Ugh! I hope you overdose on fromage. Oh, you bet I will. And some Rose and, uh... [inaudible] Get out of here. Hey, little man, let's get back before we all get in trouble. -I don't wanna go. -Aw, I know. But maybe we'll come back. Let's go. -Got it? Okay. -Yup. -I'll see you soon, okay? -Okay. Bye, Jenny. Bye, sweet boy. Thank you so much for today. Yeah, of course. What's wrong? I heard Billy screaming in his sleep, "Mommy, stop!" I spoke to Ellen yesterday. They assigned him a case worker. -They said they'd look into it. -Well, that's good. Yes, but Ellen is worried that Rachel will threaten Billy and then he'll be too afraid to say anything. It's a race against time. The good news is that he's improving daily and will be moved to Transitional Care soon. The bad news is, that means he could be discharged. -That can't happen. -Ellen's working on it. If you think of anything... She gave me her private number to, to give you. She's paranoid about talking on the hospital phones. I'm gonna talk to whoever becomes Billy's nurse in Transitional Care, see if you can visit him there. -I don't know how to thank you. -You're good for him. That's all I know and that's all I want as his nurse. So no thanks necessary. All right, Billy, is your seat belt on? -[Billy] Yeah. -Awesome. [Ellen] You're in for one hell of a ride, you know? Yeah, I know. But I can't do this without you. And deep down, you know I'm right. You know I could be right there on the unemployment line with you, right? Mm... All right, what the hell. -I'll make a call. Bye. -Thank you. This is the first time a few of you have attended a patient care conference. In these meetings we evaluate the care we are providing and how the patient is responding. Today we are discussing William "Billy" Mingo, the patient airlifted here a few months ago as a suspected child-abuse case. Pleased to have with us Ellen Graham, our head of Social Work and Beth Randall, Billy's ICU nurse. At Ellen's request, we've also invited the previous auntie of Billy, Jenny Carlyle. What we are discussing today is that Ms. Carlyle has raised a question about how the patient sustained his injuries. I believe his mother hurt him. Over the past several weeks Billy has begun to talk to me and Beth about the night he got hurt. He had a dog, bought for him by his stepfather, Thomas Mingo. -You wanna hold her? -Yeah. -Here you go. Yeah. -Oh! Oh! -It's your new best friend. -Yeah. [Mingo chuckles] You like her? -Yeah. -I'll leave you guys alone. -Have a good day. -Love you. Bye. -Love you. -[indistinct chatter] [dog yelps] Wait, mom! Quiet. Mr. Mingo was at work that night and the dog wasn't house-trained. [gasps] Hi, Sammy. Come on. Whoa. [gasps] Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, no. Billy's mother, Rachel Lee Mingo, became furious. [Rachel] I told you to put the dog back in the box. What did I tell you, Billy? I told you to put the dog back in the box! You did good in there. But it's still Thomas Mingo's word against Rachel Lee's. What we're doing here is building a paper trail so we can start the real fight, the one that's gonna take place in a courtroom. And I dunno how you're gonna stay in there for that one. Neither am I. But I have to. What are you gonna do for money? Find another job. Do you have any family that can help you during this time? -No, I don't. -Dr. Campbell. Okay. Well, I'll see you later. -Jack. -Ellen. Why are you doing this? Everything that you've worked for, everything you built is going to go south if you continue down this road. It's the right thing to do. Jenny... I'm saying this to you because I care about you. What's gonna happen if that kid won't talk or he changes his story? -Billy. -What? That kid, his name is Billy. Officer. [buzzer buzzing] -Thanks for coming down. -Of course. As a family law attorney, I can still spring you jail birds out of here. You wouldn't believe how nasty some of these divorces cases can get. And child custody cases, they're the worst. Well, there is not a judge or jury who's gonna believe that woman. What's her name again? -Rachel Lee. -Whatever. She said that you poisoned him, causing those convulsions. -With his nurses right there. -Right. Which is insane. Yeah. Okay, settle down, settle down. Think, think, think, think. Did you say you handle custody cases? -Do you do adoptions? -Yeah. All the time. I'm gonna call you tomorrow. Thank you so much. -W-where are you goin'? -To see Billy. Jenny, you can't. Jenny, there's a restraining order. I might not be able to... Jen... Jail bird. [instrumental music] [sighs] Jenny. Rachel Lee had me arrested. Said I tried to kill him. You've got two minutes. -Okay. -[Ellen] That's it. -Hey, Margaret. -Hey, Ellen. I was wondering if I could grab you really quick regarding this new campaign idea I have. -Campaign idea? -Yeah. Regarding, um, teaching families how to care for their disabled children. You don't ever come up with campaign ideas. Well, I was feeling inspired. Did you wanna just grab a drink? Something wrong? You never smile this big. -You're scaring me. -I got a lead on a new donor. Oh, okay, you're talking my language. -Uh-huh. -I'll buy. [Ellen chuckling] I might not be able to see you for a little while. But don't ever think because I'm not here that I don't love you, because I do... no matter what happens. I love you, too, Jenny. I'm gonna see you real soon. You can't keep doing this. Please. I could lose my job. [elevator bell dings] I'm sorry. Yes, that's exactly what we are petitioning the court to do. Well, just because something hasn't been done before doesn't mean it can't be done now, right? Right. Marsha, find me all the relevant cases pertaining to temporary custody, foster care, whatever, in cases of child abuse. [Marsha] You got it, boss. Get to work. Ms. Peterson, can you explain to me why you don't want this case to be handled through the usual channels? Yes, Your Honor. The State has said it would like a specific foster parent be appointed to the child. In its petition to the court, the State does not believe it would be in the child's best interest to be moved from the county until such time as the allegations of child abuse have been resolved. We are asking you to appoint Ms. Ruth Henderson to be a foster parent to the child. Ms. Henderson is a licensed and well-experienced foster-care provider and has been an auntie in the final weeks of his recovery at Children's Hospital. I understand there were issues with the first auntie? Yes, Your Honor, there have been allegations and counter-allegations that the State is in the process of sorting through. And we are confident that the truth will bear out. [sighs] Your Honor, is it in the child's best interest to testify? And is he even qualified to testify about what happened to him? I will decide what's in the best interest of this child, Mr. Jacobsen, and as for him being qualified to testify, we are not here to determine criminal guilt or innocence. This is a family court and our job is to decide where this child will be safe until the legal issues can be sorted out. But, Your Honor, is it reasonable to put the child in foster care with a, a woman he hardly knows? That may be preferable, Mr. Jacobsen, to putting him back with a woman he knows all too well. Now sit down. Don't worry. -Is the child here? -Yes, Your Honor. Ms. Peterson, this is obviously upsetting him. Should we consider alternatives? Billy is gradually regaining his sight. Every day it improves, and he is no longer fully blind. Can you see that nice lady up there? -[Billy] Yeah. -And can you tell her your name? Billy. And can you tell her how old you are, Billy? Seven. Your Honor, just because this boy knows his name and how old he is, doesn't mean he's going to tell the truth. Again, that is for me to decide, Mr. Jacobsen. Now sit down, and I don't wanna hear another peep out of you. -We'll handle this... -[judge] Billy. I want you to come up here, honey, and talk to me. There you go. [instrumental music] [sighs] [cell phone ringing] -Hello? -Are you sitting down? -Yes, yes. Just tell me. -Okay. Good news is that the court decided Billy won't have to go home to his mother until after Thomas Mingo's trial. Bad news is that it won't give Ruth Henderson temporary custody. Well, you said it was a long shot. It won't give her temporary custody without a guardian ad litem. -A what? -It's a legal term. For someone who has the interests over somebody else. Turns out Ellen Graham has been a guardian ad litem before. There's some paperwork to be filed, but it looks like she'll be approved for Billy. Wait, what are you saying? That Billy gets to go home with Ruth, at least temporarily. Oh, my God! Sallie, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You need to send me a bill. Ah, no, no, no. Don't worry about it. I'll make it up during the next fat-cat divorce I handle. [Sallie] But we're going to need a special investigator because there are things about Rachel Lee that need looking into. But for right now I'm gonna have to find my criminal court shoes, because there is a trial to prep for. [instrumental music] Ms. Lee, you are shaking. Could I get you anything? -A glass of water? -[Rachel] Hm. A cigarette. I get a little nervous when I'm not allowed to smoke. Is that how Billy got that little cigarette burn on his right arm? Objection, Your Honor. Ms. Lee is not on trial. [judge] Sustained. I apologize to the court, Your Honor. But Ms. Lee's smoking is relevant. Why is everyone calling me Ms. Lee? It's Mrs. Mingo. Well, you may prefer it, honey, but that's not your legal name. -Objection again, Your Honor. -[judge] Sustained. -What're you talking about? -I'm talking... About the fact that you're not married to Thomas Mingo. Objection, Your Honor, even if it were true, what relevance does it have on the matter at hand? Your Honor, in this court we are only interested in finding the truth. I'm sure that everyone here would agree that if you are willing to lie about one thing, you are willing to lie about many. This woman lied about her name, about who she is, about what she did to that little boy to put him in the hospital, and I'm sure there was something funny in that apple juice she brought him to the hospital that night. -Is there a question? -Ms. Peterson? My question... is about the arsenic trioxide found in Billy's system. It's a common pesticide found in your part of the state, isn't it, Ms. Lee? -I wouldn't know. -You wouldn't know? You've never handled it, never had it in your hands? -No. -Ah. Is this your name and signature there? Yeah, i-it looks like it, yeah. And you help with the family business, don't you? Your father manages a great big apple orchard. -Doesn't he? -Yes. And he sometimes uses chemicals. Fertilizers and pesticides and such? I suppose. And that's a receipt for an insecticide, isn't it? A receipt for arsenic trioxide? Um, I don't, I don't know the names of these things. I-I pick up stuff for the orchard sometimes. It doesn't prove I did anything to Billy. Why would I do anything to him? He's my son. Your Honor, we would like this entered into evidence. So ordered. Ms. Lee, I want to remind you that you are under oath. Do you ever hit Billy? Well, I swat him sometimes. How often would you swat him, Ms. Lee? I don't know. And stop calling me Ms. Lee. How often would you swat him? And did you do it because you punished him or did you do it because you can? I don't know. No. No. [Sallie] You were together with Thomas Mingo for three years hoping for a marriage proposal that never came. And you became panicked when Mr. Mingo showed Billy more affection than you. -Objection. -[judge] Sustained. He did marry me. I have a ring to prove it. Oh, well, I guess we're just going to have to take your word for it, right? Because there is no registration of marriage between you and Thomas Mingo in this state. Yes, yes, w-w-we're married. Yes, we are married. Wanting something to be so real doesn't make it fact. Did you swat Billy on that night, the night the dog made a mess in the kitchen? [Rachel] Put the dog back in the box now! [Billy] I can't stop it! [Rachel] Get over here, Billy! [Billy] No! No! [Rachel] Get up, now! [Rachel] Get up, Billy! I hated that damn dog. I... It was Thomas' idea to get it for Billy. And then Thomas Mingo went to work that night leaving you alone with that damn dog and Billy. And sometimes Thomas didn't come straight home after working the night shift, did he? Because that night he went out to the bar with his friends and they drank and they played pool, and you got mad. I got, I got mad. So, so what? And the dog made a mess in the kitchen and it made you even madder. And then you told Billy to put that dog back in the box. Yeah, I told him to put the damn dog back in the box. But he didn't listen. He disobeyed me. [Rachel] Why is the dog peeing everywhere, Billy? [Billy] Make it stop! [Rachel] Why is the dog peeing everywhere, Billy? So you swatted him a couple of times? -Yeah, I swatted him. -And he cried. And that made you even more mad when he cried. -Didn't it? -Yes. I mean no. Of course not. And Billy wouldn't stop crying and then he went to get his dog out of the box again after you had put that damn dog back in there. And you don't remember what happened after that, do you? No. Yes. Of course, I do. You don't remember hitting him over and over that night. -Do you? -Objection! Badgering. -[judge] Sustained. -I withdraw the question. -I never hit him. -Never? You just said you did. You said you hit him sometimes. Swatted. I swatted him. That, there's a difference. How much had you had to drink that night, Ms. Lee? I... I don't know. That's the truth, isn't it? You really don't know, do you? [intense music] [Mingo] Billy. What happened? What did you do to him? What did you do to him? [indistinct yelling] Calling the cops! You get away from us! Get back here! [Mingo] Rachel, get back here! [Rachel sobbing] [breathing heavily] [banging on door] [Mingo] Open the door! Rachel! Open the door now! -Open the damn door! -Help me. [echoing] I need help. I need help. [breathing heavily] [intense music] You don't know how many times you hit Billy that evening. And then when Thomas Mingo came home and found Billy on the floor and he tried to help him, he got Billy's blood all over his hands. And you had changed your clothes so that by the time the police arrived, you were lookin' pretty together, weren't you? -What happened to the dog? -I don't know. Ms. Lee, I'm going to ask you again and remind you that you are under oath. What happened to Billy's dog? -It died. -[Sallie] How did it die? How should I know? You killed that dog, didn't you? [prosecutor] Objection! Asked and answered. -[judge] Sustained. -Yes. Yes. Who cares? What does that have to do with anything? Your seven-year-old boy was on the floor where he landed after you had hit him and kicked him not once, but many times. And then you threw the dog because you blamed your actions on that dog. -Objection. -Sustained. Yeah, so what? What does that have to do with anything? -And Billy, always crying? -Always crying. Was that what did it? No. That's not what made you do it. You couldn't stand that Thomas Mingo loves Billy, that Thomas lavishes Billy with his attention. Thomas Mingo was supposed to love you the most. -Not your son, not the dog. -Objection! Come on. -Leading the witness. -[judge] Sustained. And you can't take that, can you? It wasn't supposed to be this way. Thomas should've loved me. Billy should have only loved me. He is my son. I don't care about that damn dog! He is my son and I can punish him the way I want! -'Cause he is my son! -Order! -He's my son! -Order in the court. Well, I know at least one of you has been to war and back. This one is good. I think you should look into getting it published. -Thank you. -Very dark. Mitchel. [instrumental music] [knocking on door] Hello, hello, hello! I just stopped by to give you these. Flowers? What are these for? Well, you've kind of been through the ringer and we managed to get out of it. And we've never really celebrated. Well, I owe you a lot of money, so you should probably keep your flowers. No, because I'm not telling you the whole truth. This is not actually from me. It's from some dude named John Dupont Wilcox III. -Jack? -Yeah. The same Jack who wrote me a check covering the legal fees. -Wait, what? -Read the card. "Thank you for teaching me that sometimes you have to do the right thing simply because it's right. And if you can't do the right thing yourself, you support the one who does. Your friend, Jack." I can't believe it. Well, believe it! And believe that this is just the start of great things for you. You wrote your first story and it got published. And I'm so freakin' jealous about that. And the rest of it you're just gonna have to figure it out. Just like the rest of us. But I think you're gonna get some help, help. I gotta go, got a party to go to. Wait, what? What are you talking about? [instrumental music] I got your letter. I didn't like Paris anyways. -The coffee was terrible. -Really? No! I do have something to tell you, though. There's, um, a new guy in my life. Oh. -I'm just kidding. -Ah! Already givin' me hell. But I do have something to show you. Oh-oh! Ruth is his foster mom. But as long as Ellen approves, I can babysit. He's a part of my life now. Well, that makes two of us. [Jenny] I used to think having a family was something out of reach. I feared being vulnerable. Opting instead for solitude where the only sounds were my fingers on the keyboard, or preparing dinner for one. All right, guys, food's ready. Time to eat. [Billy] Come on, Ella, let's go. -Come on, Ella. -Hello! -What did you make? -Oh, you know. -My specialty. -Frozen pizza? Could be frozen, could not be frozen. Could be Dominos. Now we prepare dinner for three. Where once were only my thoughts are now the sounds of conversation and laughter. Often times we believe we're too broken to be fixed. But there's alchemy in love, where even the tiniest cracked pieces melt together... healed and whole. [instrumental music] It's pasta. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [instrumental music]
