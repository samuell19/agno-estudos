Future Mrs. Mokoena. Yeah. Ooh! Baby, you haven't said you love me in a while. Since our engagement. - Come on. That's not true. - It is. We don't have to wait until our wedding day, you know. 'Cause we are still getting married, right? Listen, um, I don't know if it makes sense for us to still get married if the love isn't mutual. And you love me way more than I love you, Lehumo. It's a... Uh... Linda. I'm sorry. Welcome back. It's now time to meet the formidable Professor Kwame, who is also a resident professor at a top university in Gauteng. Prof, welcome to the show. Thank you for having me. Your recently launched book, Finding The Love You Deserve, is flying off the shelves. This is not your first book. Please tell us a bit more about what inspired this book. I travel the world a lot, and... Mom, this show is really boring. Um, I'm leaving now-now, baby. it's just... I know him. He's... the new professor in my department. Still boring. See? Okay, I'm leaving. Mom, Dad's still fetching me tomorrow, right? That is what he said. Okay, don't stay up too late, okay? Tebogo, um... look, I'm just checking if you're still coming to fetch Phemelo tomorrow. She's... She's really excited. Yeah, I'm just... I'm just checking. - Sade... - I'm sure the Man upstairs won't mind. - We're almost married. - But I mind. I made an oath to Him, and I intend to keep it. - Come on, baby. - Don't... Sade! Whoa. Okay. Fine. I need to go. Do you really have to go? - Do you really have to be so sulky? - I'm not sulky. I just... You know how I feel about those women. I don't trust them. Baby, those are my best friends. And they haven't given you any reason to not trust them. Sade, you become a different person when you're with them. - I become myself when I'm with them. - Are you? 'Cause it's not the same person I see in church, the same person I asked to marry me. So, which version of Sade do you wish to be? Look, at least just text me when you get home. - Mm. - You know... I will. - Hey, let's get this party started. - Yes! Nolwazi, I hope you cooked. Where? Guys, she's 30, things change. Please act like you're not our friend. Ooh, this is nice. I like this. Thank you, thank you. I could do without the shade on my birthday, ladies. You know what we could do with? The most important ingredients of the night. Of course. Uh, no, I'm okay. Thank you. Oh, no, friend, it's fine. I... We just have to pray over it, and I'm very sure God will forgive you, so... No! Stop it. No, no, no. No, ladies, let's speak about it. When have you ever seen Sade decline a glass of bubbly? Since Winston believes that a good wife does not drink alcohol, and I am that good wife. Mm. Of course, our fave, Winston. Yeah, Mr. Personality. Okay. I think that's enough, and I think it's time for a toast. Alright. What, guys? I can't toast with a cake. Okay, let's toast. To Nolwazi. To all your dreams coming true. And to lots of money. And to your name on every single billboard, and on the most expensive clothes you could ever find. Yeah. Cheers! - Happy birthday, baby. - Thank you. Um... Ladies, let me be the one to state, our good friend, Sade, has lost all her personality and spark ever since she joined that cult... What?! It's not a cult, it's a church. And there's nothing wrong with change. Maybe you should try it. And in fact, you know what, guys? Winston has inspired me to find my better self, okay? What's wrong with your current self? Nothing. It's just that I know I can be a better person, and in fact, the only wrong thing is our relationship is me. And that you guys actually haven't had any sex. That's why our wedding night is going to be so special. Okay, okay, guys, I found it. Are you ready? - What? - Ready for what? Oh, my God. You didn't! ♪ Did you hear the news on the radio today ♪ ♪ People have agreed to give their love away ♪ ♪ I can't wait to be there in line ♪ ♪ No, no ♪ ♪ Politicians have agreed To honour and obey ♪ ♪ They'll come down and listen To what the people say ♪ ♪ I can't wait to be there in line ♪ ♪ No, no ♪ ♪ Oh doo be doo be Doo be doo, bye ♪ ♪ Doo be doo be Doo be doo, bye ♪ - Breaking news. Uh... - Mm-hmm. Lehumo and I are over. Yoh. - Typical Linda. - Okay, what happened this time, Linda? I don't know. I was just feeling this pressure. Like, you know, turning 30, you should be married, live your lives together. - I didn't wanna be left on the shelf. - Ugh! The dreaded shelf. My final resting place. Okay. So, does you mom know about this? Um, no. No. Um... She's been in and out of hospital. So I just didn't want to add to the stress. Okay, well, friend. Um... I hate to kind of break it to you... ...but, um, whenever you get really close to someone, - you dump them, you do. - Mm. Yes. Like baby-faced Thabo. - And the guy that moved to Cape Town. - Mm! And then after meeting his family, you dumped him. Yes, Terence! Terence! And that dancer guy, Mondli. It's actually really sad, 'cause now it's Lehumo. Oh, my gosh, poor Lehumo... I feel like it's your MO. You need to figure out what that's about. Okay, Lehumo is boring. As in, like, yes! Bored. Yeah, and I'm sure he became boring when he gave you an engagement ring. Mm, that's true. Say it. I can't. My mouth is... Is that how you react when you get Tebogo's message? Mm! That man must've sprinkled something over you for you to still react like that. Ten years later. Babe, I hope he knows how much you love him. Yes, I do love him, but there's more to our relationship than that, guys. I just... I love how he's such a present father to our daughter. He's barely getting that part right. Well, at least he tries, right? True. But the story I'm most interested in is about the professor. Mm. Well, there's nothing to tell. We're just colleagues. Colleagues... Is that a code for "I got a crush"? No. Guys, am I not allowed to have a crush every now and then? And nothing is going to happen. Okay? Tebogo is still the one. Mm. Is he, though? Ladies, ladies, ladies. Okay. Main character syndrome, I have to show you something. Um... My birthday present to you, our birthday girl. Come on. Ready? Once upon a time... Okay, ten years ago. - ...in a land far away, - Cape Town. ...four beautiful princesses were fated to meet on the privileged lawns of UCT. - Oh, my God. Look at how young we were. - And so silly. When I'm 30, I want to... When I'm 30, I want to... - Own my own... Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - ...own my own fashion line. Yes. - And then? - And then I'm gonna... Confident, yeah. Yeah? - We're gonna? Yeah? Okay. - Okay. - I trust in you. I believe in you! - Uh-huh. Thanks, Mom. Three, two, one... When I'm 30, which is, like, a lifetime away. Okay, um, I am definitely going to own my own fashion line. I don't know about the whole institution of marriage thing. It's definitely not my thing, uh, but I will definitely be in a mutually respectful relationship with somebody. And here you are, single, single, single. Our beautiful princesses wish the fairy tale would never end, and that they would be friends forever and ever. Their wish came true. - This is nice. - It's beautiful. I'm glad you guys love it. I don't know, guys. I've just... I've been thinking lately, like... - What exactly have I achieved? - Don't be silly. You're only working with the hottest celebrity designer in South Africa.. Yeah, but it's not my fashion line. You know, I'm still renting. I don't own my own property yet. And... as you said, Sade, I'm still single. Stop it. You told me last week that your boss is designing a wedding dress for the biggest celebrity. And you'll be designing for the bridesmaids. That's huge. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Turning 30 is the pits, guys. Don't do it. Well, Nolwazi, we think you're amazing, okay? You're super talented, you're driven and you're fun. I mean, who cares if you don't own a house or have a man? Come on. Look. You've been saying that I'm not drinking. Look at this, it's still full. Boo, get off the stage. What is this? Nolwazi, today is all about you. Why don't you... I found out that I'm pregnant today. Okay. It's okay. We're here for you. Alright? - Oh, you came. - Of course. Why wouldn't I? Ah. Finding The Love You Deserve. Baby, you can't tell me you're actually reading this rubbish. It's not rubbish. What?! I heard this guy on the radio. Man is a complete quack. Well, actually, he's an esteemed professor who's just joined my department. Oh? So now you're working with him? Mm-hmm. Let me guess, and he's smoking hot too. You're so cute when you're jealous. Look, no Prof. Kwame comes close to you, okay? He'd better not. I may not be some fancy professor, but... I've been satisfying my woman for ten years straight now. Tebogo. It's so... It's so early. Aren't you taking Phemelo with you? Good morning, babe. Um, there's this big case that I'm dealing with. - It's quite the game changer. - You say that about every case. Babe, you know how it is. I've got to put in the hours. You have to put in the hours with her. Tebogo, do you have any idea how excited she is to spend time with you? I know, I know, and it hurts me too, babe, but I've got to do this. Look, you're going to tell her for me, right? I... I don't want to wake her up. Okay? I've got to go. I love you, okay? Okay. This one, or this one? Oh, baby. So... what's the emergency? Hey. I forgot. Happy belated birthday, or whatever people say. Do you mind? This looks nice. So, what's up? What's the emergency? Or... were you looking for a bit of morning glory? I thought you weren't doing that anymore, but I don't mind. We're not doing that again. Um... I'm pregnant. What? Wait, we... we used a condom, right? Aren't you on a back-up contraceptive or something? Are you? Oh, fuck. - Look, I know, I know. I'm just... - Oh, fuck! ...as freaked out as you are right now, okay? No. It's fine. It's all good. I'll support you, okay? Yeah. You will? Yeah. When are you getting rid of it? Tebogo, I said nothing about getting rid of this baby. I've barely had time to process it... Okay, now... No, no, no. Now... Now you're not thinking straight. Listen, I can't father your child. Do you get that? Tebogo... Get rid of it. Tebogo... Fuck! Dikeledi. Prof. I'm also intrigued. I've always wanted to try, but just alone, somewhere, in the dark. Where no one can see me. Nonsense. What do you need courage for? It's just dance. Well, not when you've got two left feet. People always make it look so sexy. That's why I want to try it. So? Oh, no, I... I couldn't. Um... With the child and teaching. It's just... It's quite a lot. Well, the world of dance mourns this loss. That's an exaggeration. See you later in the staffroom. You're way too pretty to be drinking by yourself. Tebogo, hi. You get it. You do. Because I am smart and talented. I think I'm just... Best sex of my life. With the worst possible choice of man. Fuck, Nolwazi. Hey, babes. Ephry is looking for you. You called. I know what's going on. You do? Of course I do. It was your birthday this weekend. It must've been intense. I mean, it's supposed to be intense. I hope it was intense. All good, just know regardless of what happens a night before, I still expect 150% of you at work the next day. We're on a deadline, girl. Time for faffage is long gone. Of course, boss. Hi. I was thinking maybe we could talk. And, uh... ...bring back these. Sure. Linds. I think you're a cool girl. When we first met, you told me you had commitment issues. I didn't listen, 'cause I thought, hey, I could change you. Look at me now. I failed. Lehumo... I should get out of here. Linda, hello. Yes, it's her daughter. Okay. One second. There we go. - Are you fine? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay? - Thank you. - Okay. - Okay, this is... - Ma? - Mm? - I told you we have two options here. - Uh-uh. I'm not going to any nursing home. I know, Ma, but you heard what the doctor said. You come and stay with me. We need to get you on the diabetes diet you should have been on years ago. Uh-uh. No sulking. And by then, you'll be strong enough to be in your own bed. What about Lehumo? We broke up. Linda! Mama, it's a long story but I'm fine. I'm fine, okay? My only worry right now is you. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Uh... - And... And now? Look, I know I'm supposed to hand these over to you and do the whole gallant thing, but quite frankly, I need to save my own ass here, so, yes, I am taking these. Save your ass from what? My sister. She just gave birth. I'm... I'm going to be an uncle. Congratulations. But look, I'm really going to need these flowers... - You don't know my sister... - And you've never met my mother. No, seriously, I am terrified of my sister, okay? But... I promise I'll make it up to you. How? There is this amazing boutique restaurant in Saxonwold. It's got a tasting menu, nine courses, wine pairings. - Mm. - You're going to love it. Hold that thought. Zero six one, girl? Zero seven eight? Zero... - Eight... - Eight one? There we go. Hmm. Um... I don't think you understand the importance of this, Sade. You don't like this one too? It's a big deal that Palesa asked you to be a part of her cell group. She is the pastor's wife, and clearly sees something special in you. I know. So why do you want to outshine her? I'm not trying to... I think... we need to seek some guidance. Dear Lord, please help Sade humble herself before You. What the fuck are you doing? I told you that I want no part in this. You can see yourself this was a mistake, so what the fuck are you doing? Don't... Don't send me updates. Don't invite me to doctors' appointments. Don't even try and share baby names with me because I don't care! Do us both a favour. Stay out of my way because I'm beginning a life with Dikeledi and my daughter. Nolwazi, you can't force me to be the father of your child. Got you, Tebogo. Loud and clear. Baby, please answer. Tebogo. Dinner at your favorite place, tonight. I thought you said you were busy. Yeah. Um, things got shifted. Well, no, thank you. - Babe, babe, babe, what's going on? - You see? That's the... That's the problem with you, Tebogo. You don't ask the right questions. I have to go. Are you going to give me a short version of why you called off your engagement? Uh... Oof. That, um... Oh, Ma, I... You know what, Lehumo and I just don't love each other the same way. I see. Is this the part where you tell me that I'm cold-hearted? Mm-mm. You're not cold-hearted, Linda. You're just scared of commitment. I'm the same. I was never ready to commit with anyone else after your father left. It's something we all have to work on. Be patient with yourself, my baby. You will find somebody who loves you, eventually. - Ma... - Uh-uh. - I'm turning 30 soon. - Don't rush. What if I don't make it in time? I swear... What, you girls all think when you turn 30 it's the end of your lives. Uh-uh. Relax. Have a little fun. Enjoy life. And where were you at 30? Married, with a child. Mm. And divorced. It wasn't fun. - No, no, but, right... - Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Linda, don't want to have to figure out everything by now. Uh-uh. We are all learning about life. There's no wrong answer. It's not a test. - Mm? - Mm. Okay. - Daddy! - There's my big girl. Hi, I missed you so much. Hey, how about you go get dressed so that we can go out and have lunch somewhere beautiful? Mm-hmm? Mm? We're not going anywhere, Tebogo. Aw, come on, Mommy. Hey, Phemelo, how about you ask Mommy to get ready so that we can go have fun as a family? Mm? Mom, please go get dressed. - Please. - Please, Mommy. Ah, thank you. Grab that over here. This is for the young lady. Don't worry, I'll pour for myself. It's fine. Thank you. To the two most beautiful women in my life. A toast... to the apples of my eye. Cheers to apples! Cheers to apples, baby girl. To apples. I love you so much, baby. Dikeledi Langa, please, baby, help me prove myself to you and be a better man for you and Phemelo. You always say that I don't ask the right questions, so, here I am, asking you the most important question of my life. Will you marry me? My parents are getting married! Yes, we are. Yes, we are. Right? Mm? I'll be honest. I don't know whether to be proud or jealous. - That's my dress! - I know. And my bridal gown didn't even crack a mention. - Oh, my God. Sorry? - For what? Africa Design Fashion Week is coming up, and I want you to design the ready-for-wear range. You're giving me my own range. What? Nobody does that. What? I know. Later. What? What? Dikeledi is engaged. Fuck! Being a leader is not only about receiving. It's also about giving. It's also about serving, and all of this starts in your own home. Mm. Very inspiring, Pastor. Sade and I are truly blessed to have you here for tonight's cell meeting. Anytime, brother. - Anytime. - Thank you. Thank you so much, Pastor. Oh, Palesa, thank you so much for the baked goods. Shame, Sade would never have made it there on time. She's generally quite busy with her job. Ah, Sade, I'm just a willing servant of the Lord. You know, where He sends me, I go, just as long as we can move His message forward. - Mm. - Just like brother Winston over here who opened up his home for us. I think him and I are so alike. I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot from you. And I must say, it feels good to be part of the home cell. It is, isn't it? So excited to have you. So... ...the wedding. Who's the maid of honour? - Um, it's going to be... - Well, actually, from my understanding, it's supposed to be someone who is already married, right? That's the matron of honour, babe. Sounds even fancier. Perhaps Palesa would be interested. - Me? - Mm. Oh! Oh, okay, great. I'd... I'd love to. Thank you so much. Sade, ah, it's such an honour. Well, let me get going, jot down some wedding ideas. I'll see you guys soon. Stay blessed. See? - Documentary filmmaker. - Uh-huh. I hear that's interesting. So what are you working on now? Oh, nothing much. Um... Just a film about single parenting, and the profound impact that it has on children in South Africa. Hmm. Now tell me more. - Mm, what inspired you to tell the story? - Ugh. Let's just say I can relate a lot. Okay, your job is definitely way more interesting than mine. But on the real, though. I just love how... how passionate you are about this. - How'd you get interested in filmmaking? - My father. Uh, yeah, he happens to be a filmmaker. So I guess I got it from him. Like father, like daughter. You're thinking out loud. I can hear you. - Um... - Um... - Too soon. Too soon. I... - No, no, no, no, it's fine. Full disclosure... I... broke off an engagement a while back. This just reminded me that I... I should probably take some time to figure things out. It's just a lot going on right now. I understand. So I suppose I should offer up my congratulations. Um... Can I come inside? Isn't that how we got into this mess? Nolwazi, you can't fuck this up for me. I'm keeping this baby. We both fucked up, and now we both have to pay the price, so... So what? My marriage is the price? You've been engaged for literally two seconds. What? Like, suddenly you care about marriage? - Gosh, Tebogo. It's way too late for this. - Nolwazi! Dikeledi and Phemelo are all that matter to me. They always will, no matter how much of an asshole I am. Please, just do the right thing. Please. I am. You know, Sade, I thought you'd be beaming after tonight's message. You know I did the right thing here. So what am I supposed to tell Dikeledi, or Nolwazi, or Linda? Sade, come on. An unmarried mother and a pregnant woman by your side now? This is a big wedding, not some small-town thing. - Oh, really? - Mm. I'm sure there's a Bible verse that talks about being so judgmental, Winston! You know what? I think you should pray about this. You'll see I'm doing the right thing here. So does this mean that I get to choose your best man, or we need some sort of guidance for that too? It's not exactly the same thing, is it? - Come, let's pray... - Oh, no, please, please, Winston. Save your prayers tonight. I'm sleeping at my place. Linda. Come. How was your day? Ma, um... So I emailed Enzokuhle. He responded shortly thereafter, and we've been speaking back and forth. But it's hard. I just... I'm struggling to find the words. I don't really know what to say, but so much has gone unsaid between us. I don't know why I even reached out to him. It's just, every year I... I go through this phase of... of thinking about him a lot. It's no matter, my baby. He's your father, you can't change it. I raised a strong girl, but you know there's nothing wrong in giving people a second chance, maybe even a third, or fourth. Forgive, Linda. Yeah, it doesn't quite, uh... suit your body type. Baby, but I feel so special in this dress. Yeah, I mean, it's like, you know... It's a little inappropriate. You know? It's not classy at all. Mm. I agree with Palesa. Let's keep looking. - Sade, Winston! - Hey. Guys, it's so good to see you. - Thank you for coming, - Thanks for inviting us. - Winston, Sade, thank you for coming. - Hey. How about I take this man away from you to get some drinks, while you gossip about us? What do you say? Friend, isn't it amazing how our dreams are all coming true? Right? What's happening with you and your wedding? I mean, you sent out invites, you booked the venue, then you just go quiet. What's going on? We need to get you a dress. Isn't your wedding, like, on your birthday? And that's like now-now. Um... Yeah, that's what I needed to talk to you about. My matron of honour needs to be someone from the church, and, um... Oh... You asked someone else? No, Winston got someone else. - What? - Yeah, I know. I was... I was pretty upset too, but, you know, because you guys are not from the church, it'd be difficult for you... Sade! This is your wedding too. And we would've managed just fine. I'm sorry, Kedi, I... I also wanted us to do this together, you know. You know what, we are doing it together. I mean, what about my wedding, you know? The bride price negotiations should be soon, and I'll need you girls to help with the cooking. Yeah. We'll be there. And you're all going to be my bridesmaids, okay? I'm not doing this without you guys by my side. - Thank you. - Alright, ladies. Break it up, unless you intend on including me in your little hug. - Hi, friend. - Hi. I never thought I'd see this day coming, but let me see, let me see. - Congratulations! - Thank you. I missed my girls. And you, how was your date? Oh, oh, that. Um, I think I'm just going to need to take some time to figure things out on my own. Yeah. Everything will work out. Um, does anyone know if Nolwazi is coming or not? Because she hasn't said anything in the group. You know, she actually hasn't been taking my calls. Yeah, she has been awfully quiet lately. You do realize she hasn't told us who the father of her child is. Yeah, but look, look, okay. Um, she won't miss it, she won't, - because you are a fiancée. - I'm getting married! Oh, my God! That's a little bit extreme. Don't you think the... Ladies! - Oh! I told you. - Hey, finally. - How are you? - Hey. - Hi, beautiful. Congratulations! - Hey. Thank you. I'm so happy for you. I'm so sorry I haven't been in touch much, guys. - Um, I got a promotion at work. - What? Oh, okay. - That's incredible. - Yeah. Nolwazi, congratulations. - Aw. - Thank you, thank you. Yeah, I get to... I get to showcase my designs on Fashion Week. - Hey! - Have my name on the design. Oh, okay. That's my friend. No big deal. I mean, you're the best, girl. Thanks. Uh... Okay, I'm making this all about me. We're definitely not doing that. It's just that it's been... Hey, no, you don't need to explain, okay? I know it's... it's tough, you know, just having a baby and... It's not like it's something you can just shove away, and put on the shelf and forget about, okay? We're all here for you, okay? Actually... I have something for you already. Let's go, ladies. Follow me. Follow me. - You don't have to. - Alright. Yes, it's for you. It's lovely. - It's good to see you. - Good seeing you too. Remember when I still worked at the bar in our grad year? My tips got us this! Yeah, I remember. I can't believe you kept these after all these years. I got this with my very first salary, like, the way I couldn't wait to spoil the little princess. Do you really have to give me all of these, DK? I mean, you don't have to. Look, I'm sure you are, but on one condition, friend. - You have to let us in. - Yes. You're going on such a beautiful journey, and you actually can't do it on your own. Please? You know we love you. And I mean, friend, if you're pregnant, we're all pregnant. - Weird. - Okay, no, wait, that... Okay, that didn't come out the way I thought it would, but... Friend, you know what I mean. Mm? I need to go pee. Yeah, the bladder. Pregnancy things. Um, I need to use the bathroom. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Oh! Babe, don't be getting any ideas from Nolwazi here, okay? We are not having a sibling for Phemelo. One baby is enough. Kedi. There's something I have to tell you. Oh, yeah sure. What's up? I... I just wanted to thank you for being so generous. Friend, anything for you. Hey? Ma? Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma, wake up. Ma! Ma! Ma, wake up, wake up. Ma. Ma! Mama, wake up. Shit! Shit! Hey. What happened? Um, she has a pulmonary thrombosis. Linda, you can come through. Ma? Ma? I'm not gonna leave your side, okay? I'm here. Ma? - There you are, Daddy. Um... - Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you. Oh, Sade. Aren't you going to dish up for Winston? Oh no, uh, Winston usually dishes up for himself. Dish up for him. He's your future husband. You look after him, he looks after you. - Right, Winston? - Yes, Ma. Sweetheart, please do me the honour. You know, most women these days don't know how to take care of a husband, but I'm so grateful that Sade has your marriage as an example. Sade. Don't be too hard on yourself, sweetheart. Your marriage will work out just fine. Thank you. Winston is a good man. Keep him happy. And I will do everything in my power to make sure that she is happy. - Uh, shall we say grace? - Oh. He's not coming, Mom. He's coming, sweetie. He knows I made his favorite tonight. Can I eat? Of course. Let's just say grace first. Bless the food we are about to eat. Amen. Amen. Oh. Geez, Dikeledi, you scared me. Shouldn't you be sleeping by now? You'd prefer for me to be sleeping. Okay. What are you talking about? Tebogo, I didn't sign up to be your security guard. You promised me, unprovoked, that we would be a family, and you've broken that promise from the second I moved in here. I didn't break any promise, babe. I've been working... You act like you're the only one with a job. The same way you act like I'm the only parent around here. Tebogo, I've had enough. Enough! Okay, guys, I'm giving you till 4:00 p.m., and that's it. Okay, class, don't forget to do your readings for the tutorials coming up next week, okay? Full class, hey? You must be popular. It's Freud and first years. They probably think the whole course is going to be about sex. I was disappointed too when I found out it wasn't. Um, do you have time to grab a coffee? With me? Uh, I mean... sure. - Unless you had other... - No, no, I'm... I'm available. You know, you and the girls are taking shifts here to check up on Mom and I. We just want you to know that you're not alone, friend. Thank you. But it's getting late and we need to get you and our little one home safely. We'll be fine. Okay. - Shout if you need anything. - I will. I see you're sporting some new hardware there. - Congratulations. - Oh. Thank you. So... when is the big day? A rock that big, bride price negotiations must have gone very well. - No lobolo yet. - Hmm. - No lobolo, doesn't that mean no wedding? - Something like that. Well, then he's a fool. Someone will come and snap you up while he's busy getting his cows in a row. I guess I could wait another ten years for a wedding. Seriously though, Dikeledi, you don't look like the, um, blushing bride you should be. Oh, come on. I'm too old to be a blushing bride. No one is ever too old to find happiness and love. - It sounds good, in theory, but... - But what? Maybe I need to do something for myself for a change. Something that I want to do, and not think about other people. As they say, you can't love anyone else until you love yourself first. I wonder which self-help book that one came from. I'm a professor in psychology. Knowing everything comes with the territory. Oh, I can tell. Dikeledi. - Oh, uh, Gideon, you joined. - Ah. Yes, of course. Hello. Welcome. I'm pleased to announce that we have another person joining our group, so we're finally an even number. - Please, could you introduce yourself. - Uh, hi, everyone. I'm Dikeledi. Dikeledi, may I suggest you partner with Gideon. He's one of our most talented. Right, let's partner up! Five, six, seven, go. One, two, three, five, six, seven. Okay, no, no, it's fine. It's fine. So we pause on four, okay? - Oh, okay. - So, imagine. That's good. Six, seven and pause. One, two, five, six, seven. One, two... There you go. Dikeledi! Thank you, my dear. Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six. Mm! - You're a great teacher. - Thank you, my dear. Nice. Oh, my word! Tell me Nolwazi isn't still at it. Girl, I'm not running a sweatshop here, eh? You can go home. To what? My dirty dishes? Hey, now's the time to delegate, to ask for help. Showcase is a big deal. It's all hands on deck. No, no, I... I've got everything under control. - Alright, let me see. - Oh, um... No, uh, they're not ready yet. Please. Designs are never ready until they've been on the runway, and even then you can still make changes. Besides, the entire industry knows I'm your mentor, - so I have to see before everyone else... - No, you... I've seen this design before. This is the reason that I asked you to join my studio. Why're you repeating it? You're not a one-trick pony. What's going on? I'm listening. I... I haven't had any inspiration. Everything... Everything in my life is just falling apart. I... I thought maybe if... if I show you something that you'd liked before, it's better than nothing. Nolwazi, I've asked you every week if you needed help, and every time you told me no. If you think this is gonna hit the runway, you are sorely mistaken. Not gonna happen! You know what, I can't do this. So I have a confession to make. - Mm-hmm. - No judging, okay? I've read all your books... ...and my friends think I've got a celebrity crush on you. I'm flattered that you think I'm a celebrity. There, come on, you're judging. I'm not. Um... Sorry. Dikeledi. Hey, Linda. I was just taking a chance. I... I didn't know if you were up yet. I've been up. Um, yeah, I'm on my way to go see Ma. Do you feel sorry for me, Dad? Is that why you're being so nice? Look... I feel like I've let you down for so many years, that this time, I wanted to be clear that I'm not going to lose touch with you again. Uh, well... We'll chat a little bit later. Of course. I love you. Hey, Ephry. I'm sorry that my designs disappointed you. You can tell the ADFW to take my name off the list of designers showcasing. No. You've been asked to showcase, and showcase you will. Nolwazi, as a designer, as any creative force, you need to learn to draw your inspiration from various things. Beauty and, most importantly, people. - I wanted this to be my thing. - And how's that working out for you? It's not. Now, just because you're collaborating with people, it doesn't change anything. You remember those bridesmaids' dresses I asked you to make a couple months back? Do you think I was worried it wasn't going to be "The Ephry Show"? No. That's exactly why I asked you to make them. I wanted to show you that's when we come together, that's when we collaborate, that's when... ...we make the person in the spotlight shine, as a team. Okay? No man is an island. It takes a village, okay? All hands on deck. But we don't have time. Says who? Now you don't have to use any or all of these. Your colleagues and I put these designs together in the hope that it would, you know, put a spark back in your life. Just draw from within. Oh, thank you so much, sis' Nthabi, for this thoughtful gift. As we know the Bible says, "The hand that gives is more blessed than the hand that receives." Ooh! And we've got this lovely... Looks like the full cult is out in their numbers. And that forward one over there, is that, um... maid of honour? - Matron of honour. Get it right, friend. - Mm. She's actually the pastor's wife. I suppose now isn't a fitting time to bring out this gift over here. Vibrator. - Well, I got her lingerie. - Can I hear an "Amen"? Her first night is going to be legendary. Winston doesn't even know it. - Okay. - Oh God. Pray for your marriages. Because there are women out there who are preying on your relationships. - Can I hear an "Amen"? - Amen. I got her wine glasses. I totally forgot that her and Winston don't drink. That's right. Hey, girl. Look, the wedding is right around the corner. Excited much? Babe, what's wrong? Guys... like, I feel like my whole wedding has been taken away from me. Like, how am I not able to pick my own bridesmaids? Never mind that, I couldn't even pick my own dress. Winston chose your dress? Both Winston and Palesa. Ladies, I told you, I know a crazy bitch when I see one, and that there is a bitch in the flesh. Hey, hey! Hey. - She'll hear you. - Okay. Friend, this is supposed to be the happiest moment of your life. If you're not happy, then that's a huge problem. Mm. I know Winston loves me, guys, but it's just my parents. My parents think that Winston is the best man for me, and I just want to do this and get them off my back. How's our little one doing? We haven't gone to any of your appointments with you. Um... The baby is growing nicely. Uh, the doctor is happy, so... And baby-daddy? You know you're going to eventually have to tell us who it is, just in case we need to take him to maintenance court. Mm, that's a good point. I mean, maybe we can chat with him, - and make him do the right thing. - Yeah. Okay, okay, guys, hold on. That's enough. It doesn't matter who the father is, okay? As long as we know who the mother is, that's all that counts, right? - Thank you. - Yep. Friend, shout if you need anything. Anything. - Of course, of course. - Okay. This is me. Goodnight. Drive safe, my love. Goodnight, babes. I'm tired. I can imagine. Let's go to sleep. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Give to me. - Tebogo! - Let me see. - Tebogo is the father of your baby?! - What? - How is he the father of your baby? - Mm. This is a new kind of "no", Nolwazi. A new kind. Shh! Sade! Mm. - Mm. - You can't tell her. Okay, seriously, you can't. Neither of you can. Look, I... I know I've done a horrible thing, okay, - the worst thing of my life... - You have. Shh! Yoh! - I've done the worst thing of my life. - You think? But this is... But it's my secret to tell. This is so selfish of you. You're going have to tell her. No! You have to tell her. I will, I just... I don't... I... Wow. Sade! - Sade! - Winston. Oh, you bitch. - What? - Shut up! Just shut up. You... are a liar. - Winston! - And a whore! Winston! What are you doing? - Jezebel. - Winston, please. Winston! Winston, wait, please. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Hmm? Wait! Winston. You made me believe I was marrying a virgin. Winston, I didn't say I was a virgin. All that time you're just the... the varsity mattress, huh? Huh? You know, I was told that tonight... ...by one of my clients! Bheki Ngcobo. You remember him? He told me he fucked you just like every other guy in the res did the same fucking thing! Winston, that's not true. - You're denying you slept with him? - It's not true, I did sleep with him. - Oh... - I was like 19 or 20 years old... Winston, wait. Wait, Winston, why is it even a thing? We all have a history, Winston. To provoke me... No, Winston. Please! Provoke me! - Winston! - Come here! Winston! Sade! Sade, please let me in. Sade. Alright. Sade? I just couldn't bear to see you humiliated like that. I'm sorry and I love you. Please. How... Hello. Try opening the door. Hey... Ah. Really a surprise. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you, Sade ♪ Ooh! Friends! Guys! Friend? Friend. - Sade. - Mama? Mama? Friend, what happened? It's Winston. At his bachelor party last night, he said a client of his pitched there... - Bheki Ngcobo. - Bheki, the... the model from varsity? Yeah. He told Winston that him and I had sex, and... and that I practically slept with the whole res. Wait, so Winston hit you because of that? Because of Bheki? Who cares how many people you have slept with? - It's practically none of his business. - Mm! Friend, he had no right to hit you. What am I going to do, guys? - What do you mean, what're you gonna do? - Maybe I'm the one that humiliated him. How? If he loved you and... and respected you, he wouldn't care how many men you slept with. Exactly. The only person who should've been hit is that Bheki Ngcobo for having the audacity to speak about you years later. So, I guess the wedding is off then. Okay, uh, what do you need from us? I just need you guys to be there for me at the wedding. Please. No judgment and no questions asked. Okay, friend, ah, please. - I need a smile. - Okay. It's straightforward. What do you want to achieve by 30? Look into camera. I'm gonna count you in. I'll roll, we record. - Okay. - Thank you. By 30, I would have loved to achieve, um... I'm going to own my own car, convertible, my own penthouse, and married to a very rich husband, who's gonna worship the ground that I walk on. I wanna thank you all, everyone, for coming here today to witness Winston and Sade commit themselves in front of God. And I must say, Winston, - you guys look blessed and beautiful. - Just... You okay? What are the very fundamental principles of marriage? I'm gonna go to the bathroom quickly, okay? Okay. You see, without those four, your marriage is built on sand. - Nolwazi. - What the hell do you want from me now? So, what have you decided? I'm telling Kedi the truth. No! No, you can't! - You can't be this selfish... - It's the right thing to... For who? Hmm? And if you tell her, I'll tell her you seduced me. Who is she going to believe? The pregnant slut or her fiancé? Okay, fine, whatever. Whatever. Tell Kedi that. Tell me what? Kedi... Tebogo is the father of my child. No. Tebogo, tell me this... this isn't happening. Baby, she... No, Nolwazi, wait, you guys are... You guys are lying, right? Baby... So did you propose to me before or after you got her pregnant? - Can you please calm down? - I want to know! After. You humiliated me. You lied to me. - Baby, I... - Time I wasted loving you! That I would never get back! Kedi... And you! You were supposed to be my friend... my sister! Did you guys know about this? You fucking knew! You knew! No, I didn't... - And you kept it from me, all this time! - Kedi... I'm done with you. All of you! Fuck you... Fuck you, Tebogo. Phemelo. Phemelo! Everyone brought great ideas to the table, and with each idea, I saw myself in them and them in me. Uh, but you said to look within, and so I did. Each design tells a story of opposites, and this represents the good and the bad. The thing about looking within though, is you have to be really honest with yourself. This pregnancy hasn't been an easy one, Ephry. I slept with my best friend's boyfriend. That's how this came about. I learned, though, that from the bad, some good can come from it. My unborn child. I had to do some deep searching within me to realize that I've got some dark energy. You and everyone have called me selfish. And you're right. I am selfish. I have the best girlfriends anyone could ask for. Women that would probably give their right kidney if I asked. But I haven't honoured that friendship. I do have some good in me, though. Creativity... ...growth, and the sacrifice of growing my child. Now, for the name of the collection. Kedi. Kedi has been a stellar friend. One would even say that she's mothered me a number of times, whether she knows it or not. And, uh, just because I broke her heart and our friendship, it doesn't mean that she doesn't deserve any recognition, doesn't mean that she doesn't inspire me. She's an awesome, awesome person, and an amazing mother to the delightful mini-Kedi, Phemelo. What do you think you're doing? I'm trying to sleep with my husband. Winston, it's been over a month since we've been married, and you haven't touched me. You need to cleanse yourself in the eyes of our Lord before we consummate our marriage. Winston, I have prayed so many times, I'm sure the Lord has forgiven me. But have you asked me for forgiveness, Sade? Baby, can you please forgive me? I'm not ready. Linda, your mother's condition is not getting any better... ...and we think that it's time that we switched off the machines. Her heart is too damaged at this point. I'm so sorry, Linda. Happy birthday, Mommy. Oh, thank you, my baby. This is so beautiful. Thank you. There you go. Two things we need to discuss before you go. First, your work. Now that you're married, you no longer need a job. Winston, but I love my job, and I'm good at it. I even told you this at the premarital classes. It makes me look like I can't take care of my own wife. Am I your wife? We haven't slept together, remember, Winston. I've worked so hard to be the lead auditor of Maxwell and Symes. Sade. The church is very clear that a woman's primary responsibility is to look after her family. Has the church forgotten about the Proverbs 31 woman who works to help her family, Winston? That brings me to my second point. Your friends are not married. It's not good for those who are married to be friends with those who aren't. You want me to quit my job, and quit my friends? These are my conditions. Oh, I... I think your school transport is early. Mom, you've got visitors. Happy birthday. Um... Your... Your transport is here. Thank you. Why are you here? To celebrate your 30th birthday, Kedi. And what? Forget about everything that's happened between us? No, of course not, Kedi. We just wanted to show you that we love you. A cake and big gestures are not going to solve our problems. We know. We know. Um, at least we wanted to start somewhere, you know? And you, you have the nerve coming to my house after everything you've done. Kedi, I came to apologize. You're sorry? Sorry for what, Nolwazi? I mean, it's very easy to say you're sorry, but people never really say for what. - We got drunk... - Drunk! All of you have spent the last ten years telling me what a terrible person Tebogo is, but the first chance you get to jump into his pants, you do! How am I supposed to trust anything that comes out of your mouth? What am I supposed to think? That what, you... you wanted him all along? No. No. It... I'm... Kedi, look, this friendship has meant something to every single one of us. Fuck this friendship! I know what I've done for this friendship, but what has this friendship done for me? Nothing! This is how I get to turn 30. With no close friends. The people I have literally dedicated my life to have hurt me the most. Hmm? That's me! Happy birthday, Dikeledi. - Kedi... - Don't! Get out. I'm late for work. Kedi. You raised Linda... ...the best way you knew how, and I was a coward. I ran away. But I'm not going to let her go... go through this time without my support. Dad. Turning the big 30. You know, I think it doesn't really matter how old you're turning, as long as you're surrounded by loved ones, your friends, your family, your career is blossoming. I mean, if you've got that, what more could a girl ask for? Um... Come in. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday... ♪ I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Sorry, it's, uh... It's not you. My friends, they... they came over this morning to apologize. So... have you sorted things out now? No. No, I was too angry and too hurt and... Only after they'd left, I... I realized that they were there before Tebogo was and... Now that it's over between him and I, they came to my door, uninvited, to apologize. That must count for something. If trust has been broken, then you find a way to mend it. If you've hurt somebody, you apologize, and then you do not repeat the same mistake again. Friendships are not always meant to be perfect. The long-lasting ones... ...they have been roller-coaster rides. It adds spice to the memories. You're always ready to give advice. It comes naturally. Whose birthday is it? Happy birthday. Thank you. Siphokazi is not looking strong. I was not expecting her to be this bad. I wonder why she didn't say anything. I mean, how would she have said anything? Well, we spoke, you know, every now and then. She told me about her diabetes diagnosis, but she didn't say anything about her heart. So, you and Ma spoke? And you never saw it necessary to call me? My angel... it's not like that. I... I tried, I really did, you know? And she told me that you were not ready for me to reach out, and I had to respect that. You say you tried. You tried! Maybe I wasn't ready. I was angry. And I still am, but that is not an excuse for you to not make an effort to reach out to me as your daughter! How did it become my responsibility to try and fix our relationship? You have every right to be angry with me. Yes, that burden was on me, but I was also too ashamed to reach out. I mean, what... what would I have to say to a beautiful young lady... Come on! You don't get to play the victim in this situation. You don't. Take some accountability. "I am sorry, Linda." I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I don't know how to say it, but I am sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I know it's not going to take away what you've been through. You don't even have to forgive me. I am a horrible father, I know that. I'm sorry. The hospital said that there's nothing they can do. So I need to decide... when to switch off the machines. Can I come with you? Please. You're so beautiful. Oh, hi, beautiful. You look amazing. Turn around. Lovely, lovely. Work this, okay? When you get up there, just kill it. Hi, gorgeous. Let me, come. - Um, love these. Can we just tweak those? - Knock-knock. Hi. Okay, maybe just some lips on her. Okay, cool. - I just came to say good luck. - Thank you. Oh, my word! Everybody looks incredible. I know. - I'm proud of you. Mm. - Thank you. Break legs, everyone. Okay. Thank you, Ephry. Hi. Um, hi. I'm... I'm Dikeledi, Linda's friend. Oh, okay. Um, I'm... I'm Enzokuhle, Linda's dad. Oh, uh, lovely to meet you, sir. It's great meeting Linda's circle of friends. Let me go call her for you. Oh. My friend. Nolwazi! - Nolwazi! - Call an ambulance! There you go. Thanks. Do you think you'll ever forgive him? Uh... Will you forgive us? Come on, Linda. I'm here, aren't I? Thank you. Oof. Yeah. Sorry. It's okay. - Hello. - Nolwazi Khumalo's next of kin? Next of kin? There's been an emergency. She's been rushed to theater. Okay, um... Um... Winston, I... I have to go. Where are you going? I'm pretty sure you have a cell group meeting later. Nolwazi just... I need to rush to the hospital. You're not going anywhere. I'm going. Sade, if you walk out that door... Sade! Hey. I'm sorry about Mom. It's okay. Hey. Hey. Ooh. So, how's Nolwazi? She's been rushed to theater. She's having an emergency C-section. Okay. Yeah, she had severe eclampsia. There was a placental abruption or something like that. They've said there's a 50/50 chance of her... not making it. I'm leaving Winston. Ladies, they are both going to make it. It's a girl. Come here. Come to Aunty Sade. - She's so cute. - She's got that... She's like, "Hey." Oh... Kedi. I'm sorry. Truly. I know. I know. Mm. Hey, who's that? Who is that? - Right, today's your fashion show. - What?! Oh... And then the "Kedi" name? Well, the theme this year was inspiration. So... Go on to Mommy, baby. Come, baby. I'm sorry, baby. Put her down so you can rest. - Yeah. - There you go. Um... Friend... I don't know if you've heard, but... Mama didn't make it. Linda. No, don't, don't... No. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. This... is a happy moment. Right? We've lost someone we love, but we've also gained someone we love. - Yeah. - Yeah. Siphokazi. Siphokazi. Huh? Linda, I... I think I want to name my baby Siphokazi. A gift we've been given. Because you and my baby are birthday twins. - No. - Linda. - Mm. - Oh, my goodness. - Linda, we forgot your birthday. - You did. No! - Girl. - Happy 30th birthday. Thank you. - Happy birthday! - Thank you. - Happy birthday to both of you! - So much has been going on. - I get it. I get it. I get it. - So much. What the f... - Wow, I really should have guessed! - It's not what it looks like. Oh, it never is! - I'll really enjoy this divorce, Winston... - Sade... - Sade! Sade! - ...man of God. Wow! Sade... Can you close the door, at least? - Thank you. - You're welcome. To... - Us. - ...us. - You look nice. - Mm. You guys. Okay. Get a room! Okay. We'll leave you ladies to it. Okay. - Okay, enjoy yourselves. - Thank you. Bye, gentlemen. Takes a sip. Is this you? It is. We're goin' good. But better late than never. Yeah. You know, I... I guess we could kind of call this, uh, Linda's birthday month. It's always a good time to celebrate a woman like me. How about Linda's dirty-30? - Ah! I like that. - It's going to get down tonight, guys. Did you see what she did with Kennedy? Tonight and every night. - Okay. - Enough. Okay, I'm sorry. You know what, ladies, um... just having you all here, all of you, after everything that's happened, it's honestly the best birthday gift I could have ever asked for. - I'm gonna cry. - To you! Before you start crying now. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday to me. ♪ Happy birthday to me ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Linda ♪ ♪ Happy birthday... ♪
