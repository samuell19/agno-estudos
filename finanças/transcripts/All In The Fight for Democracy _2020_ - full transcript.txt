It might be a race for the Governor's Mansion in Georgia, but this is one that the entire country is watching. And if ever one vote counted, it certainly is going to count in this particular race. Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! The controversy surrounding Georgia's governor's race is not dying down. Both candidates dug in today. Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams are locked in a virtual dead heat. Everybody wants to know what's happening in Georgia. Still a toss-up there, as we're waiting for a number of votes to come in. They believe there are tens of thousands of absentee ballots that have not yet been counted. Voter suppression has become a national talking point, and Brian Kemp has become a focal point. All of the votes in this race have not been counted. On Tuesday, as you know, we earned a clear and convincing victory at the ballot box, and today we're beginning the transition process. Kemp was leading Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams by a narrow margin, and it grew more and more narrow in the days following the election. Abrams filed multiple lawsuits but ultimately dropped out of the race. I acknowledge that former Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be certified as the victor in the 2018 gubernatorial election. But to watch an elected official who claims to represent the people and the state baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people's democratic right to vote has been truly appalling. So, let's be clear. This is not a speech of concession. Because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper. As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that. The fundamental power of democracy lies in the right to vote. If you protect that right, you create possibilities for everything else. Too many Americans take for granted the right to vote and don't understand that unless we fight for the right to vote, unless we try to include as many people as possible, our democracy is put at risk. This right to vote is bloody. It is contested. And the reason it is contested is because the vote matters. ♪ Register, inform yourself and vote ♪ ♪ Register, inform yourself and vote ♪ ♪ A country doesn't run itself ♪ ♪ Every voter is a help... ♪ There are those who argue that America is not a democracy or a republic. We are a democratic republic because we use democracy to elect our representatives. What is democracy? Democracy is a system in which the voters choose the people that govern them. I vote for every, every election. I don't care what it is. I don't miss voting. And my voice, I want to be heard. That's what it's supposed to be. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she is determined to push for mail-in voting across the country in the next relief bill. The things they had in there were crazy. Uh, they had things, uh, levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again. When elected officials feel like they may not have the power anymore, they have two choices. They can either be more responsive to those they lead, or they can eliminate the people they have to answer to. I registered to vote at DMV about nine months ago. I found out three weeks ago that I wasn't registered. Progress doesn't only go in one direction. We've had expansions of American democracy, but we've also had times when things have moved backwards, where people have lost the right to vote. A monumental decision by the Supreme Court, changing the Voting Rights Act, the law of the land for 48 years. History is never a straight line. It's always a fight. If everybody's vote was important and equal, then why are certain people in certain areas, of certain backgrounds, why is their vote being limited? - We're here to stay! - Now, some call it a safeguard for the integrity of New Hampshire elections. Others see it as a political ploy to try and keep voters away from the polls. I just think it should be a little more difficult to vote. There's nothing unconstitutional about-about literacy tests. The fight over voting rights is ultimately about power. Districts have been scrambled all over the state of Texas in the past, and they elected white people and nobody questioned it. Do you believe that democracy exists in America? Well, I've lived in America all my life, and I've never seen democracy yet, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about. People in Washington know nothing about reality. They know nothing about what's happening to little people in the community. But you add it all up, and all of a sudden, p-people look at their government, think, "It doesn't represent me." And in many cases these days, uh, for a lot of reasons, it really doesn't. In Wisconsin, voters headed to the polls today, the first state to hold a major election with in-person voting in the midst of a stay-at-home order. Do they expect us to go against public safety? The United States is the only country that makes it so difficult for communities to own their power by requiring them to jump through hoops to simply participate in basic elections. It's pernicious because it convinces you that maybe it's not worth trying again. And when entire communities become convinced that the process is not for them, we lose their participation in our nation's future, and that's dangerous to everyone. You cannot understand where we are right now unless you understand the history of voting rights and the struggle for voting rights. Past is prologue. Those forces that are systematically determined to keep American citizens from voting, they have been laying the seeds over time. When we started as a country, it wasn't really anything like what we would consider a democracy. Only white men who owned property had the right to vote. That was a very small segment of the country even then. The Constitution begins with the words, "We the people." And yet, who were the people? It doesn't include slaves. It doesn't include women. Doesn't include Native Americans. Doesn't include young people. So, the notion of "the people" is very restricted. You won't find sitting anywhere in the articles of the Constitution where it says, "American citizens have the right to vote." When you have the-the founders writing in the language of Enlightenment, dealing with getting rid of monarchy and getting rid of kings and-and having this wonderful, beautiful republic, and then you have six percent who are eligible to vote. White male property owners. It tells you we had a lot of work to do. I grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi. My dad was a shipyard worker. My mom was the head librarian at William Carey College. Both of my parents were first in their family. My mom's the only one of her siblings to finish high school and, let alone, go to grad school. My dad was the first man in his family to go to college. My mom and dad were very prolific. I am the second of six children. My parents were very intentional with us. And we had three jobs. You had to go to church. Had to go to church. And you had to go to school. Go to school and take care of each other. And in the meantime, you had to do something - to help someone else. - Help somebody else. We would volunteer at soup kitchens and homeless shelters. If there was someone in need, my parents found a way to make sure we were there to help. Which was odd to us because, we would point out, we were poor, too. Why are we serving other people? They would say, "Having nothing is not an excuse for doing nothing." And I'll tell you what, when those kids were growing up, every time we voted, we took them with us, and they saw us cast our ballot. And we'd sort of trail out of the voting booth like Make Way for Ducklings because there were so many of us. But they wanted us to see them in the act of casting a vote. My parents were admitted to Emory University in 1989 to become United Methodist ministers. I was 15, so I was unhappy with the world around me, so I was very excited about moving to Atlanta. I attended Avondale High School, and I became the valedictorian of my high school. When you're valedictorian in Georgia, you get invited to meet the governor of Georgia. It was a Sunday morning. We got dressed, put on our best clothes and got on the bus because we didn't have a car. We get to the guard gate, and the guard looks at me, and he looks at my parents, and he says, "This is a private event. You don't belong here." My dad says, "No, no, this is my daughter Stacey. She's one of the valedictorians." But the guard doesn't check his checklist. He instead... I remember very clearly him looking over our shoulders at the bus that's pulling away, and he looks back at us, and he basically says, he's like, "No," like, "you don't belong here." The story he told himself was that these three Black people getting off a bus, they can't possibly belong in the Governor's Mansion on this day that's celebrating success and opportunity. - ♪ Let 'em know ♪ - ♪ Uh, yeah, we winnin' now ♪ ♪ Yeah, we risin' to the top, new beginning now ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - ♪ And we never gonna stop ♪ ♪ Yeah, we grinnin' now ♪ ♪ Never been here, wow ♪ ♪ But we in here now, holla black, yeah... ♪ My parents had a very engaged and spirited discussion with this gentleman about his decision-making skills, about his reading comprehension. Robert had to have a few choice words. It was explained to him in a certain way that, if you want to stay healthy... - Well... - ...you look at the list. I won't go no further than that. ♪ Yeah, we're here now, uh, uh ♪ ♪ Yeah, we're here now... ♪ What I remember about that day is not meeting the governor. Don't remember meeting my fellow valedictorians. All I remember is this man standing in front of the most powerful place in Georgia, telling me I don't belong inside. And that was my first encounter with the governor of Georgia. ♪ Stand up, stand up, stand up ♪ ♪ No time to hide, we can't be denied, nah. ♪ It never occurred to me to think I could be governor. I had simply never seen it. When I started running, that story for me was an important narrative because it reminded people that, just as I was told I don't belong here, so much of what voting is about is whether you belong, whether you have value. James Baldwin said that "people are trapped in history and history is trapped in people." We can't escape where we come from, but it's our responsibility to reshape what that story looks like. After the Civil War, the number-one question was: What is gonna replace slavery? What system of labor? What system of politics? What system of race relations? Reconstruction is the nation's effort to come to terms with the abolition of slavery. They were trying to figure out, "How do we heal this nation? How do we stitch it back together?" And then you've got four million freed people. "How do we do this?" The three amendments... the 13th, 14th and 15th... were not just small-scale changes in an existing structure. They made the Constitution, for the first time, a vehicle through which people could claim greater equality. They actually transformed the Constitution into something new and different. They took slavery out of the Constitution, where it had been embedded. They created for the first time a national definition of citizenship and insisted that all those citizens and other persons in the country had to be treated equally. And they mandated that African American men must have the right to vote. That amendment in 1870 said the right to vote "shall not be denied or abridged" on the basis "of race, color or previous condition of servitude." The state shall not abridge the right to vote "on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." The idea of a national standard for voting was very controversial. During the debates on the 15th Amendment, even Northern states wanted to keep control of the voting qualifications, because there were people in their state they didn't want voting. And it's not about blacks. California and Oregon did not ratify the 15th Amendment, because they were afraid that it might let Chinese people vote. But by 1870, when the 15th Amendment was ratified, Black men now had the right to vote in every state in the union for the first time. And indeed, also to hold office. What Reconstruction offered was a fresh start for America. You had this moment where Black citizens enjoyed citizenship. That was evidenced by Black men going to the U.S. Senate. You start having Black elected officials in these amazingly high spaces where you would not have imagined them 20 years earlier. That was the power of Reconstruction, and that was the power of the vote. Please welcome the first lady of our movement, Mrs. Coretta Scott King. Hi. Welcome, all of you, my brothers and sisters, to this 30th-anniversary March on Washington. Dr. King's spirit is with us. When I spoke at the March on Washington, I was 19. I was terrified, and I do not recall to this day actually giving that speech. I'm delighted now to introduce our next speaker, Stacey Abrams, who is a junior at Spelman College in Atlanta. She has helped mobilize students to be here today, and we are very, very proud of our sister, Stacey Abrams. Stacey. There was a guy with a clock who told me, "You only have X amount of time to speak." And I remember him saying, "Start." Jobs, justice, peace. This is a theme that we've been hearing today over and over again. This is a theme... When you walk onto the stage and you look out over the Reflecting Pool, I'd never seen that many people in one place in my entire life. Today we come before you, walking on the road to jobs, the road to peace, the road to justice. When I was in college, I was very involved in voter registration. What I was concerned about as a young person was how many people weren't taking advantage of this right, of this power. I set up voter registration opportunities, and I would annoy my friends, and they did not care. But I knew how important it was to have this right to vote, because I'd remembered my parents teaching me about this. I'd seen what it meant. At Spelman, I used to go to city council meetings. I was starting to understand how government worked, but I was also becoming very aware of how it didn't work. I was protesting. I burned the Georgia state flag because it had a Confederate emblem on it. We first tried to get a meeting with the governor to talk about it, and when that wasn't fruitful, we decided to bring attention to it by setting it on fire. Now, I got a burn permit for it, so everyone knew I was doing it. I'm like, "I don't have to break the law to make my point." Stacey Yvonne Abrams, magna cum laude. I learned at Spelman College I didn't have to limit my goals to what I'd seen other people do. Today, I come to you as a young person, as a young woman, as a young Black woman, to ask you to use us. Use the young people of the United States of America to pave a road that will last forever. The first great protest march on the nation's capital ever was for the right to vote for women. In 1913, the day before the presidential inauguration, 5,000 women marched down Pennsylvania Avenue. It took pushing and pushing and pushing. It took hunger strikes, picketing in front of the White House. All these creative, nonviolent protests... that was new to this country. This was before Gandhi had done a lot of these things. But the women's movement and the fight for women's suffrage introduced them to the United States. We get to the 19th Amendment that guarantees women the right to vote. When you look back at how long women fought for the right to vote... We're used to movements now... ten or 20 years, and the change happens. Women spent their entire lifetimes fighting for the 19th Amendment. Black women were instrumental in the passage of the 19th Amendment, and they had been part of this conversation from its beginning. Women who were helping shape opportunity for white women and for Black men, and yet, in each of these conversations, Black women were left out of the narrative. And then, post-Reconstruction, Black men, who had suddenly become part of the body politic, were once again disenfranchised. The greatest moments of progress are followed by the most intense periods of retrenchment. That's what happened after the Civil War. Reconstruction was a high point for voting rights, and it was followed by nearly a hundred years of Jim Crow. The decision to remove the troops from the South was a decision made by one vote in the Congress. One vote put an end to Reconstruction and started the era of violence and bloodshed and Klan-led catastrophes. The South was trying to figure out, "How do we stop all of these Black folk from voting? If they continue to vote, we're in trouble." How do you say, "We don't want Black folks to vote," without writing a law saying, "We don't want Black folks to vote"? Mississippi said, "Oh, we've got this. "We have figured out how to get around the 15th Amendment, while systematically denying the vote to African Americans." And that was the Mississippi Plan of 1890. What Mississippi came up with was: We are going to use the societally imposed conditions on African Americans and make those conditions the access to the ballot box. What you say is: Democracy is expensive. Elections are expensive. And if you're really invested, you should be willing to pay a small fee. A poll tax. It's not too much. It sounds so reasonable. But when you begin to think about what that means... You can pay for food, or you can vote. You can pay for some clothes for your children, or you can vote. And then the literacy test. The literacy tests are misnamed, in a sense, because they weren't really tests of one's literacy. They were traps. They were designed to never let you be able to answer them correctly. I actually took out one of the old literacy tests from Alabama. My class of second- and third-year law students could not pass the literacy test. There were literacy tests, poll taxes. Grandfather clauses, all-white primaries, property clauses. If this one doesn't get you, this one will. If this one doesn't get you, this one will. There were this raft of different laws that were called the Black Codes. And those laws criminalized basic normal behavior. It was a crime to be on a city street without having a place to go. It was a crime not to have a job even if what you were doing was looking for work. If you were caught loitering, meaning you were waiting for your wife in a store, that could be a pretext for arresting you, incarcerating you and permanently disenfranchising you. That felony disfranchisement coming out of Florida in 1868... what that does is it strips you of your right to vote. It is a way to-to neutralize the 15th Amendment. Virtually overnight, African Americans are eliminated from the electorate in the South. So, you go from having Black governors and senators to having almost no... if not any... Black voters that were able to participate in elections. In Mississippi, during Reconstruction, African American voter registration was almost 67%. By the time we have fought the Nazis and we are moving into the Cold War where the U.S. is really holding up as the leader of the free world, only three percent of age-eligible African Americans were registered to vote in the South. Three percent. The word says, "Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised." ♪ I'm gonna praise him, I got to get it out... ♪ My name is Desmond Meade. I grew up in Miami, Florida. I am what we call a returning citizen. Returning citizens are people with previous felony convictions. You know, I used to tell people that my story didn't have a happy ending because I lived in Florida, where over 1.68 million people had a lifetime ban from voting and other things. After graduating high school, I went into the service. When I returned home, I was addicted to drugs, and I was in and out of jail, and I ended up checking myself into drug treatment. I experienced a transformation. What have I done with my life, uh, to make a difference? Florida leads the nation in denying the right to vote to one specific group: felons. For years, we have lobbied politicians to change these old Jim Crow laws, and we were not able to accomplish anything. If there's a million and a half convicted felons in Florida and they're suddenly all qualified to vote, that universe of people are probably gonna be more inclined to favor the Democratic Party. What data is there to support that? - None. - Mm. So, if the politicians did not have the political strength or courage to actually change the policies, then the next best thing was to let the citizens, uh, take it into their own hands. Let my people vote! Let my people vote! In October of 2014, we launched the ballot initiative. All of the experts thought that it was impossible to even get it on the ballot. But this was an organic grassroots movement. We knocked on a lot of doors. - We're gonna change the history. - All right. We made a ton of phone calls. We're talking to voters about Amendment 4, the voting restoration amendment on the ballot this November. Have you heard about it? And our message was very simple. When the debt is paid, it's paid. Uh, and that this was an all-American issue that impacted people from all walks of life. I'm a 20-plus-year conservative Republican. I bring that up not to make an issue of it but to actually not make an issue of it. This issue isn't about politics. It's about people. Out of all the civil rights, nothing speaks more to citizenship than being able to vote. Today is midterm Election Day. Voting's gonna be in full swing here in just a few hours. Voters in Florida are preparing to vote on a measure that would restore voting rights to 1.4 million people, one in five African Americans in Florida and ten percent of the state's adult population. Amendment 4, if it passes, is expected to change the shape of Florida's electorate for decades to come. Millions of votes already cast here in Florida, but millions more will vote today. It looks like Amendment 4 will pass. Amendment 4 passing by a wide margin. 64% there. Get the vote! Get the vote! Get the vote! I need every returning citizen here on this stage. That's right. When Amendment 4 passed, there was a feeling of joy and appreciation for folks to be able to... to participate in our democracy. We did it! Oh, my God, I am... I am feeling, like, on cloud nine right now. That population in Florida and around the country, they are the legacy of the Black Codes. They are the legacy of the Mississippi Plan. They are the legacy of attempts to permanently disenfranchise African Americans and to block their participation in society. Birth of a Nation... it's based on a novel called The Clansman, which is a glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. Why is the Ku Klux Klan glorified? Because it saved the South from the horrors of Black men holding office and, uh, being corrupt. You get to the early 1900s, and you have the reign of terror from the Ku Klux Klan. And what you see is almost a total purge in lots of the former states of the Confederacy of Black political participation... ...at the butt of a gun, at the butt of threats of violence, through lynching and chaos. There was terrorist violence on a massive scale in the South. Between 1880 and 1950, somewhere around 4,000 Americans are lynched... and almost all of them African Americans. So, let me tell you a story about Maceo Snipes. Maceo Snipes was a World War II veteran. When you have fought fascists and you have fought for democracy, you want some of that democracy for yourself. He came home to Georgia, and Maceo was determined to vote. There was an election going on, and Eugene Talmadge was running for governor. The federal government is working consistently to tear down states' rights. And Talmadge was running on the platform to, as he said, keep the Negroes where they belong. And so Maceo goes down, and there's a sign that says something to the effect of: "First Negro that votes, that'll be the last thing he ever does." Maceo was like, "I fought fascists. What you got?" And so Maceo went in there, and he cast his ballot. He was the only Black person in Taylor County, Georgia, that voted in 1946. Maceo goes home. Nothing happens for a few days. And then... He goes to his door. White man says, "Could you step out on the porch?" Maceo's like, "Sure." And then he sees three additional white men. And then he hears... And it was a firing squad, and they laid Maceo out. The message was really clear. You vote, you die. Election Day terrorism was designed to provide the kind of intimidation that said, "If all of the pieces "of the Mississippi Plan can't stop you, we've got some bullets and a rope that will." And this is why you see the kind of insurgency happening in the Black community that leads into the civil rights movement. This kind of... "I shall not be moved." ♪ Soon it will be done ♪ ♪ Trouble of the world... ♪ My name is Roosevelt Lee. I went out to Liberty to try to register, and the next day, when I went back to my job, the man fired me. After being questioned, I was carried into a room where a police officer came in and got a rope and said, "Okay, nigger, get up in here and let's go. "We're going to have a hanging here tonight, and you're going to be first." ♪ No more ♪ ♪ Weepin' and wailin' ♪ ♪ No more ♪ ♪ Weepin' and wailin' ♪ ♪ Going home ♪ ♪ To live ♪ ♪ With my Lord ♪ ♪ Soon it will be done ♪ ♪ Trouble of the world... ♪ In my life, I never would've imagined I would have the honor to stand here. And when I got the request, my very next moment was to call my mom and my dad. My parents, Reverend Robert Abrams and Reverend Carolyn Abrams. You see, my father was arrested at the age of 14 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. He was arrested for helping to register Black people to vote. My mother was doing the same work. She was just smart enough not to get caught, but... All of that started here in Selma. ♪ No more... ♪ Selma, Alabama, is located in Dallas County. 17,000 of the county's residents are Negroes. However, only 1.7% of these are registered voters. The Negroes of Selma, Alabama, want to vote. We're willing to be beaten for democracy, and you misuse democracy in the street. You beat people bloody in order that they will not have the privilege to vote. You can turn your back now, and you can keep the club in your hand, but you cannot beat down justice. And we will register to vote because, as citizens of these United States, we have the right to do it. You're under arrest for contempt of court. Selma really awakened the nation. In Selma, Sheriff Jim Clark was refusing to let them register to vote. They wouldn't even pretend to go through the motions. I want to start out by commending you, the Negro citizens of Selma, for standing up. Sooner or later, Sheriff Clark will understand that he's dealing with a people that will not stop until they have full freedom and human dignity. Dr. King and a large number of Selma Negroes marched through the city streets in small groups to the county courthouse. One woman, Mrs. Amelia Boynton, was grabbed by the sheriff and hustled along the sidewalk into the custody of deputies. Dr. King and I, we had been working together to get a civil rights bill passed. We went back, and we met with President Johnson, and he said, "Well, I know you need voting rights, "but we just had a civil rights bill passed. "I just don't have the power "to go back to Congress for another civil rights bill. I know it's needed, but, uh, I don't have the power." And he must have said, "I don't have the power," half a dozen times. When we left, I asked Dr. King, "Well, what are you gonna do?" He said, "We're gonna get the president some power." Uh, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee has a statement. We, the Negro citizens of Dallas County and other Alabama Black Belt counties, are marching today from Selma to Montgomery. A couple of hundred people showed up. John Lewis led the march. We're marching today to dramatize to the nation, dramatize to the world the hundreds and thousands of Negro citizens of Alabama, but particularly here in the Black Belt area, denied the right to vote. Then they get to the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It's real quiet. They're like, "Where is everybody?" The Alabama state patrol and Sheriff Jim Clark were on the other side of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It'll be detrimental to your safety to continue this march, and I'm saying that this is an unlawful assembly. You are ordered to disperse. Go home or go to your church. This march will not continue. You've got two minutes to turn around and go back to your church. Is that clear to you? Major, may I have a word? I've got nothing further to say to you. Troopers here, advance toward the group. See that they turn around and disperse. You see people just stumbling. You see them being trampled. And the cameras are rolling. That Sunday, everybody was watching the movie Judgment at Nuremberg, which was about Hitler's slaughter of the Jews. They cut into their movie of the week to show the footage of Bloody Sunday. The nation was appalled because one of the ways that Jim Crow worked so smoothly and so effectively is that you didn't have to see it. But when you see the violence raining down on people who are just fighting for the right to vote, it tells you that something is systemically, fundamentally wrong in this democracy. It-it was just... it was ruthless and brutal and... and criminal. But it was what... It was what changed the South on voting rights. A nationwide movement for voting rights erupted that week. All over the country, there were protests, there were sit-ins. My father saw it as a pivotal moment to seize upon America's angst so that Americans would come and say, "Yes, the cause is just. The time is now." Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult. But about this, there can and should be no argument. Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. Because it's not just Negroes, but really, it's all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome. He ended his speech with: "And we shall overcome." That's the only time I saw Martin Luther King, uh, shed a tear. We gave him the power. All of us working together got the Voting Rights Act passed. Lyndon Johnson understood that, while he had been an impediment to civil rights for decades, the time had changed and it was time for him to change. But more importantly, he understood that if the power of the right to vote was truly made available, it would change the future of this nation. I'm the product of the Voting Rights Act. An act that was bought and paid for on Edmund Pettus Bridge. With foot soldiers who believed that they had the right to be there. Because when you stood up and went across that bridge, those were the wings of the eagles - that Isaiah talked about. - Yes. It may have looked like feet marching across the bridge, but that was flight. Days after the Voting Rights Act was passed, there were federal officials in the South registering African Americans to vote for the first time in counties where Black people hadn't been able to register for decades. This was truly revolutionary. By 1967, two years after the Voting Rights Act, almost 60% of Black adults in Mississippi registered to vote. Game changer. September of 2018, I went home to visit my grandmother. And Grandma had a recliner that sat right next to her bed. When you go to visit my grandma, you sat down because you did not want to interrupt whatever it was she was watching. And so, I sat on the bedside waiting for her attention, and, uh, she turned to me. And unprompted, my grandmother reached for my hand, and she started telling me about the first time she voted. It was three years after the adoption of the Voting Rights Act. But it was the first time for most African Americans that they really would have a chance to participate in an election. And this was during a time where you put on your Sunday best and you would make an event out of going to vote. My grandfather called for her from the front room. Her name was Wilter. And he's like, "Wilter, come on!" She didn't respond. Her nickname was Bill. And so then he yelled out, "Bill, it's time to go." And my grandmother said... she still didn't say anything. So he came back to find out why she hadn't responded. And she was frozen. She was afraid to go. I remember her squeezing my hand and the feel of that paper-thin skin and the fragile bones but this grip that she had on my hand where she said that it wasn't that she didn't want to vote; she was afraid of it. She was afraid of the billy clubs and the hoses and the dogs, and she did not believe that this time would be any different. She didn't believe that the power of democracy was finally hers. And my grandfather told her that she had to get up, that her children had been in trouble trying to guarantee this right and that she owed it to them, if not to herself, to get up and vote. And she said she was still terrified, she was still deeply afraid of this moment, but she was also ashamed of herself. She was ashamed that she didn't want to reach for this power. She got up, she finished getting dressed, and they went to vote. And as squeezed my hand, she said, "But, Stacey, I've never missed another election." Mississippi and the other Southern states are engaged in a life-and-death fight with the federal government. What is this fight all about? The Voting Rights Act of 1965. Insofar as the Negro is concerned, it will suspend all literacy requirements of the Mississippi law. Georgia has no problem with reference to voter registration. We do not need federal registrars in this state. I am unalterably opposed and will fight to the end any attempts to reshape or mold our state to conform to the prescription written by dictatorial left-wing integrationist social planners daydreaming on the bank of the Potomac. The Southern states challenged the Voting Rights Act immediately in the courts as unconstitutional. But they fail. The Supreme Court upholds the law eight-to-one. If you frame the argument, "Who doesn't believe that people should be allowed to vote?" while there will be some people that will raise their hand, most Americans believe that citizens should be allowed to vote. The bill that I will sign today extends the temporary provisions of the act for seven more years and broadens the provisions to bar discrimination against Spanish-speaking Americans, American Indians, Alaskan Natives and Asian Americans. The Voting Rights Act began with the former Confederate states, but this was a law that understood that discrimination could crop up anywhere. The state of Arizona was such a bad actor that in 1975 the U.S. Justice Department added Arizona to the process because of their long history of discrimination against Latinos and Native Americans. Hispanics were facing some of the same kind of things in Arizona, in Texas, across the Southwest, that African Americans faced in the segregated South. Things like literacy tests, voter intimidation. They said, "We need protection in the Voting Rights Act as well." Maricopa County is the largest and most important county in Arizona. From 1960 to 1964, William Rehnquist was in charge of ballot security operations for the Republican Party of Maricopa County. This was called Operation Eagle Eye. And what Rehnquist and others did was they went to Democratic parts of Phoenix and they asked Latino and African American voters if they could read the Constitution. So, this was a de facto literacy test. And if people could not read it to the satisfaction of Rehnquist and others, Rehnquist challenged their eligibility to vote. William Rehnquist, the future chief justice of the Supreme Court, was on the front lines of voter suppression in Maricopa County, Arizona, all the way back in the 1960s. America's most unwelcoming prison regime likes to advertise it always has vacancies. It shows I will always have room for illegals. The man who calls himself America's toughest sheriff makes his prison as unpleasant as possible. Arpaio became the face of terror for our community. We would see posses going to neighborhoods to do roundups. There were checkpoints to ask people for their papers. It created a righteous anger, saying that we deserve more and we do not deserve to live under this. We gotta tell the whole world! This is ACE territory! I said, my people! Yeah! - We got a story! - Yeah! We gotta tell the whole world! This is ACE territory! All right. How's everybody doing? - Good. - Good? How's everybody doing, y'all? - Good. - All right, dope. About almost three years ago, it was my first day at LUCHA. And Stephanie was up here at the front, and she was talking about how we're gonna register a lot of people to vote. And I remember her giving me the clipboard, right? And she was like, "All right, we're gonna go to Walmart." And I was so scared. ♪ I'm still hopin' for the tours wide open... ♪ Our volunteers are standing on the shoulders of folks that have paved the way for us to be able to cast that ballot and become part of a power community that is now impacting policies. Hi. Are you a registered voter? No? How come? Are you a citizen? Hola. There is always a debate on: Why aren't our communities participating? - I'm already registered. - Oh, you are? What about y'all? No, I'm not. No? How come? I don't know. I don't... I don't trust poli... politicians. No, you're right. And so it's like, I'm out here doing my thing. No, heck yeah. I feel like... I-I mean, that's how I thought, too, right? The most important part of voter registration is that human connection and being able to understand why that person does not trust. Intimidation from the government is real. It is powerful. And it is because of the changing demographics in the nation. It is the fear of what this larger vote can mean. ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ ♪ Don't let it get away ♪ ♪ Beautiful day ♪ ♪ Touch me... ♪ If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. Opponents of the Voting Rights Act seized on Barack Obama's election as a reason why the Voting Rights Act was no longer necessary. At the very moment that you see the ultimate progress, you see conservatives embracing that progress as a reason to try to get rid of the law that made Obama's election possible. Barack Obama scared the bejeebers out of them. He brought 15 million new voters to the polls. This is what we should be celebrating: bringing 15 million new people into this incredible civic society, engaged in this democracy, believing that they have a stake in this democracy and getting out to vote. Instead, that Obama coalition becomes the hit list for voter suppression. How do we stop African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, the young and the poor from voting? The Supreme Court decision, Shelby County v. Holder, allowed that to happen. Shelby County, Alabama... there was an election there in which the districts were redrawn... ...so that the only African American city council member lost his race. Voter suppression and gerrymandering are two sides of the same coin: efforts by politicians in power to try to manipulate the process to benefit themselves at the expense of others. Gerrymandering is a real problem. It's the practice of drawing voting districts in a way that creates unfair advantages for whoever happens to be drawing the lines. In the age of computers, you can gerrymander with scientific precision. You can run in and out of alleys and up and down streets and carefully include and exclude whichever voters you want in one district and not in another. Shouldn't all of this be illegal? Well, that's complicated. Because if you are gerrymandering to disadvantage minorities, yes, that is illegal under the Voting Rights Act, but if you are gerrymandering to disadvantage voters of an opposing party, that has generally been allowed. Shelby County willfully violated federal law. They didn't bother to go up to the Department of Justice to check on whether it was okay as they were changing the voting boundaries as the Voting Rights Act required. When they got called on it, when they got sued, they said, "We didn't do anything wrong. The era of racism is over." What had been bipartisan before became extremely partisan after the election of Barack Obama. You know, people tend to forget that Republicans supported it. Every reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act was signed by a Republican president. I think that democracy, if it's to work, then everybody that's eligible to be a voter should be registered, and they should vote. I am proud to sign the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. Ronald Reagan called it the crown jewel of American democracy, but with every subsequent reauthorization, there's a legal challenge brought. It's a seemingly coordinated strategy that we have seen waged by opponents to rip out the heart of the Voting Rights Act. It was almost a strategy of, "Let's throw spaghetti against the wall and see which one sticks." The Shelby County case is the one that survived the lower courts and winded its way up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court hears a challenge to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Its detractors say the Voting Rights Act is out of date. Its defenders consider it a needed bulwark for justice. The Voting Rights Act requires nine states to get federal approval of changes to their election laws. From a lawyer's point of view, this is a valid legal case and it could be honorably argued. And that's the business we're in, so we took the case. We'll hear argument first this morning in case Shelby County v. Holder. Mr. Rein? Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court... We argued that the Voting Rights Act was probably one of the deepest intrusions of the federal government into areas that states traditionally administered. Think that that really doesn't mask the need for equal treatment of the sovereign states. I'm gonna have a hard time with that. You can't treat states the same, because their problems are different, their populations are different, their needs are different. Everything's different. All of the noncovered states are worse in that regard than the nine covered states. - Is that correct? - J-Justice Scalia... Every-every one of them is worse? Justice Scalia, it's-it's a fair question. - It... - Not just a fair one. It's the crucial question. The South has changed and made progress, but some things remain stubbornly the same, and the trained effort to deny African American voters the franchise is part of Alabama's history to this very day. Have there been episodes... egregious episodes... of the kind you're talking about in states that are not covered? Absolutely, Chief Justice Roberts. Well, then it doesn't seem to help you make the point that the differential treatment continues to be justified. John Roberts had it out for the Voting Rights Act as far back as 1982. Early in his political career, it was John Roberts's job to try to prevent the Congress from reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. John Roberts, his mentor was William Rehnquist. This is why this lineage is so important. Because he hated the Voting Rights Act. I knew that this was an important act. I knew that it was doing important work, and I knew that it would be a disaster for the court to strike it down. A controversial ruling today by the Supreme Court. Five-to-four, the U.S. Supreme Court took the teeth out of a law enacted nearly 50 years ago. It invalidated a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by the three other liberal justices, said... I am deeply disappointed... deeply disappointed with the court's decision in this matter. This decision represents a serious setback for voting rights and has the potential to negatively affect millions of Americans across the country. I don't know if it's appropriate to say... I was pissed off by what the, uh... by what the court did. - Thank you. - It really struck home that this was a political decision that the court was making. Justice Ginsburg was correct. If you have an umbrella that keeps you dry in the middle of a thunderstorm, the fact that you are dry doesn't mean that you don't need the umbrella. Every single one of those states that was covered previously by the Voting Rights Act was told, "Never mind. We think you're good now. Go forth." The floodgates literally opened in 2013 when the Supreme Court issued its ruling. The ink on Tuesday's ruling wasn't even dry when Texas's Republican attorney general declared that his state's controversial voter I.D. law will take effect, quote, "immediately." Just hours after the decision came down, states began to implement voter suppression laws all across the country. Texas took the lead on this one. It spread like wildfire. So, you're seeing them in Pennsylvania. You're seeing them in Kansas. You're seeing them in Wisconsin. You're seeing them in Ohio. Nine more states are enforcing new laws requiring eligible voters to present a government-issued photo I.D. at the polls. Overwhelming majority of Americans, regardless of their political views and regardless of their race or ethnicity, support voter I.D. laws. This is not Jim Crow. This is not a police dog. This is not a fire hose. When you restrict access to the right to vote by creating a narrow set of I.D.'s that can be used, it's creating blocks to people being able to participate. They try to make it seem rational and facially neutral, racially neutral, but it's not. We had voters who were born in the Jim Crow South who had no birth certificates because white hospitals would not allow them to give birth in their facilities. I had my Social Security card, my To Go Pass. I had my UnitedHealthcare. I had my red, white and blue card. And I had my Ford card. And that still wasn't enough to vote. About 21 million Americans don't have strict forms of government-issued I.D. That works out to about ten percent of the electorate. You know, you look at Texas. If you have a state-issued photo I.D. that says you're allowed to carry a concealed weapon, that's sufficient to allow you to vote. If, however, you have a state-issued photo I.D. that says you're a student at the University of Texas, that's insufficient. Young people in America, they could have the most power of any electoral bloc in the country. If you take out one or two campuses, you can swing an election. So, that's exactly what New Hampshire Republicans decided to do. Studies will show that if you can get young adults to vote between the ages of 18 and 24, they're more likely to vote going further into their adulthood. Once you strip someone their access of being able to vote, it takes away their role within our democracy. Voter suppression has often targeted communities that are seen as nonnormative. And we saw this come into sharp relief in North Dakota, where a law that required a residential address on driver's licenses seemed benign. But the reality was that, for those communities, getting a residential address on a reservation required that the state or local government grant that to you, and it didn't happen. A majority of Indian country does not have physical addresses. They use post office boxes. It became very evident that the law was created to suppress the Native American vote. The only way to get recognition is to vote. And that's what it is... a matter of survival. In Wisconsin, they put a new voter I.D. law in effect in the run-up to the 2016 election. Lot of Republicans, since 1984, in the presidential races, have not been able to win in Wisconsin. Why would it be any different for a Ted Cruz or a Donald Trump? Well, I think Hillary Clinton is about the weakest candidate the Democrats have ever put up, and now we have photo I.D., and I think photo I.D. is gonna make a little bit of a difference as well. Up to 23,000 people were blocked or deterred from voting, and Donald Trump only won the state of Wisconsin by just over 22,000 votes. So, this one restriction in Wisconsin alone had a huge impact on Donald Trump becoming the next president of the United States. Ohio has become, sadly, the leader in creating certain types of-of voter suppression that other states have followed. And there's no bigger example of that than purging. There is certainly need to update your voting rolls. People pass away. People move. There also are some states that are really smart about this. Things like automatic voter registration. But Ohio does the exact opposite. Ohio's had a purging process where, if you don't vote in several elections and you don't respond to a postcard, you're knocked off the rolls. When it comes to the right to vote, Ohio is a "use it or lose it" state. In a split five-to-four decision, the Supreme Court ruled that in Ohio you can be dropped from the voter rolls if you do not vote for about six years and do not respond to a card the state sends you in the mail. They send you a postcard to your house. It really does look like a piece of junk mail. If you don't send it back, they assume you're not there. Then they purge you from the roll. They say, "Oh, this person didn't send it back. We're gonna drop them." They're not notified that they have been purged, and that-that's a problem. In a state of less than 12 million, two million have been purged. A lot of people are on that list 'cause they move every year; they're poor. They're going from one place to the next to the next. But also, it turns out there are thousands and thousands of people on this list who had voted recently, who were not supposed to be on the purge list. 20% of those people were on in error... government error. And in the United States, the right to vote is the only right you can lose for not using it. You can decide not to go hunting on a Saturday, and you don't lose your 2nd Amendment rights. But in nine states, it is the law of the land that you can lose your right to vote simply for not using it. After the Shelby decision, we saw over 1,600 precincts close in the states that were once covered by the Voting Rights Act. And when you shut down a polling place where someone can go a mile to vote, and suddenly they have to go ten miles and they don't have a car, they will not vote. Under Brian Kemp, 214 polling places shut down in the state of Georgia. He used the gutting of the Voting Rights Act almost immediately. Jim Crow 2.0. That's what we're seeing. When you look at Georgia in 2018, it is the rise of Jim Crow again. The Shelby decision, what it did was give carte blanche to states like Georgia to restore every racist trope they had. Had I run for governor in 2012, it would have empirically been an easier election. By the time I was running for governor, I had had eight years of watching the Secretary of State Brian Kemp build a national reputation for voter suppression. We anticipated that voter suppression was part of Brian Kemp's behavior. What we couldn't anticipate was that I was going to be in a fight with the very person who controlled the system. I got a big truck just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take 'em home myself. Yep, I just said that. Yeah, he just said that, and he's joining us now, the candidate who calls himself "a politically incorrect conservative," current Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Good morning, sir. Morning, guys. Great to be on with you. Brian Kemp had the ability to not only be the candidate in the race, but he was also running the election. He was the constitutionally authorized election supervisor. That would have been illegal in virtually every other advanced democracy in the entire world. We sued Brian Kemp multiple times over his efforts to lock people out of the ballot box. One of his most nefarious schemes was called "exact match." More than 53,000 Georgia residents have had their registrations put on hold thanks to a policy that requires their applications to precisely match information from other state agencies. Georgia's population is approximately 32% Black, but the list of voter registrations on hold is nearly 70% Black. Well, well, well. My old friend racism. I've been expecting you. The ACLU filed a lawsuit because absentee ballots were being rejected because the signature on the absentee ballot purportedly did not match the signature that was on file. The problem is signatures change. It's one of the worst metrics to use. A lot of people for whom English was not their first language will have an inconsistent signature because they have to write and sign their American name. Asian voters, when they immigrated here, they adopted an American name. My grandmother had an American signature, and she has not been able to sign that name consistently. The argument for many of these voter suppression laws is this very fallacious argument that it's necessary to stop voter fraud. The voter fraud is real. It must be stopped. We need every tool to go after it. Voter I.D. laws stop voter fraud. I've dedicated my career to fighting voter fraud by doing things like having photo I.D. Every time voter fraud occurs, it cancels out the vote of a lawful citizen and undermines democracy. We can't let that happen. When Donald Trump lost the popular vote, he lost it by 2.9 million votes, and he said three million people voted illegally. And there was no evidence to back this up, but this was a dramatic assertion of voter fraud on a really unprecedented scale. Trump employed this rhetoric to create his own, quote, unquote, "Commission on Election Integrity." There was really an all-star cast of some of the biggest vote suppressors in the Republican Party today. People like Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation that had built the case for voter I.D. laws and similar restrictions on voting. The president's Advisory Commission wanted to get the voter registration list from all the states so they could start doing comparisons and find people who were still on the list who were deceased, to find individuals who were, uh, voting in more than one state. Yesterday, the vice chair of that commission sent a letter to all 50 states, asking for voter data that includes addresses, party I.D., voter history and Social Security information. This was like a Big Brother data request. There was no evidence that the administration would insure the privacy and security of this data. And moreover, why did they need to know party affiliation? Many states resisted that. They refused to provide that data. Opposition to this is bipartisan, to some degree. Mississippi's Secretary of State, a Republican, has called it a violation of voters' privacy and said that the commission can, quote, "go jump in the Gulf of Mexico." The Commission on Election Integrity that Donald Trump formed was a complete and utter disaster. It disbanded without issuing any findings, and it found no evidence of voter fraud during its entire investigative process. We have a database at the Heritage Foundation that we're constantly adding to. It has a sampling of proven voter fraud cases, uh, from across the country. Um, it's got almost 1,300 cases in it. Here's what they truly found, and let's put it up again for people. 146 million total registered voters. Out of those, there were 2,068 alleged voter fraud cases. Okay? So it does happen, but it doesn't happen on a national scale... Doesn't affect the outcome. ...that would affect the outcome. So, then you ask yourself, why do we have this architecture of all of these obstacles? Voter I.D., gerrymandering, purging, poll closures. Why do we have all of this if voter fraud is virtually nonexistent? When you ask that question that way, then it leads you down a path where America must look at itself again the way that it looked at itself when it saw the cataclysm on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Running for governor was about changing what it meant to be a leader in Georgia. And there's nothing more transformative in the Deep South than a Black woman from poverty having opportunity. It hadn't been done before, so I thought I would take advantage of the freedom to try the things no one else tried. We know that voter turnout is the best remedy to voter suppression. We decided to go after everyone who could vote. Y'all already been out to vote? We need everybody out there in droves. I'll make sure they vote. Matter of fact, they ain't gonna work tomorrow if they don't vote. - Ooh, give me some! - There you go. That's what you got to do. - You got to put it out there like that. - That's right. I've been out here talking to people who are... "Yeah, I've never voted before." "Oh, I've never had someone come to my door before." Too often, politicians only go to the people they know, and they only engage the people they can rely on. But go out there, man. We're trying to make history. - You know what I'm saying? - Yeah, I'm gonna vote. All right, that's what I want to hear. Which means you don't adapt to the changing needs of community. Thank you so much for your time. Among democratic countries, the United States stands out for having very low voter turnout. Politicians produced the system because elections are easier to manage if the electorate is smaller. Hello, Georgia! I was asking everybody, "You know Stacey Abrams? "You know Stacey Abrams? You know Stacey Abrams?" Finally, somebody said, "I know Stacey Abrams." And they said, "I have her cell number." I go, "Give it to me." "I will call her up right now." So I called Stacey Abrams, and I said, "Stacey, this is Oprah." You know what she said? She said, "Girl, let me pull over to the side of the road." Ladies and gentlemen, Stacey Abrams! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! My name is Stacey Abrams, and I am running to be the next governor of the great state of Georgia. We talked to people. We met them at their doors. We met them at their churches, their mosques, their temples, their shrines, their synagogues. I went to Dragon Con and ONE Musicfest. I also talked about real issues. I talked about my brother and his fight with drug addiction and incarceration. There are thousands of Walters throughout the state of Georgia... - Yeah! - ...who only get the help they need when they go to prison. - Yeah! - I'm running for governor because I don't believe Georgia's just a state of retribution. I want to see a state of redemption! Yeah! Let's get it done! Let's get it done! Let's get it done! But I also had solutions, and I talked about the things that people care about every single day. Georgia, we need you to show up and show out. - ...Stacey Abrams... - ...Stacey Abrams... We wanted everybody who could vote to vote and to vote for me. It is in our hands to make Stacey Abrams the next governor of the state of Georgia! And give it up for your next governor, Stacey Abrams. Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! Thank you, Georgia. One of our missions in our campaign was to focus attention on early voting. And so, by way of example, I went to vote early. I came to my precinct armed with my I.D., ready to cast my ballot. I also had a bunch of television cameras with me because we wanted to publicize how important this was. I hand my information over, and the young woman, with great trepidation, tells me that I cannot vote because I've applied for an absentee ballot. And I lean in quietly, and I say, "No, I didn't." I've voted in the state of Georgia since 1992. I've never applied for an absentee ballot. She desperately wants to be helpful, but something had happened, and she did not have good information. Her manager came over, we talked, and we were able to figure out what needed to be done. What worries me are the thousands of people in Georgia who tried to vote that didn't have CNN and MSNBC standing over their shoulders who were told no and who believed that no was the answer because they didn't have the authority or the knowledge to demand better. We really knew by the last week of early vote that we were seeing extraordinary turnout, um, beyond our projections, and we also knew that we were seeing an extraordinary inability of the election system to process the folks. It was the very big warning bell that Election Day was gonna be a problem. We were with Brian Kemp and his family as they showed up to vote. It said this was an invalid card. - Okay. You go back in there. I'll redo it for you. - Yeah. And Kemp had some voting issues. His voter card said "invalid." You just went and cast your ballot there. - Yeah. - During your tenure as Secretary of State here, you've made it harder for tens of thousands of people in Georgia... I would disagree with that question completely. ...to cast their ballots across the state. Because you have no factual basis on making it harder for people to vote. It has never been easier for people to vote in the... in the state of Georgia than it is right now. One of the races that we've been watching really closely is the governor's race in the state of Georgia. From Midtown to Marietta, we're seeing long lines at polling places across the area. This morning, we got here at... when the polls opened at 7:00. We were told that the machines weren't working. Finally, at 11:00, they got machines that were working, so we've been in line for five hours. How long have you waited - in line here this morning? - About three and a half hours. - You gonna go home? Come back? - I'm-I'm hurting. I-I'll be back. I got to go take some medicine. These lines are insane. We had a big fucking problem. Um, people are leaving lines all over. I'm getting the reports. My parents are U.S. citizens. They've voted in the past, but today, when they showed up to vote, they were told that they were purged from the voter rolls. We'd received thousands of calls to our Voter Protection Hotline. Conversations about people being turned away from the polls. I can't find this one. - This is where you would normally vote? - Yes. The name didn't come up, in your case. It didn't come up even when I search. Those stories were coming to me at every moment. Some were here for three hours, others here for much longer, after the Express poll machines stopped working inside the Annistown Elementary polling place Tuesday morning. We knew who we were up against. We had been fighting this guy for years. And then to see what the result was of intentional underfunding of elections, intentional non-training of local elections officials. He says he went to cast his ballot Tuesday morning, he handed the poll worker his I.D., and then she... Says, "Mr. Whitten, wait. Stop. You've already voted." I said, "No, I-I think I would've remembered that." She says, "No, I see here that you voted, and, uh, it looks like several days ago." Intentional purges, intentional precinct consolidation. They combined two locations, gave us three machines. Last election, I had 12. I don't know why. Intentional lack of training around absentee and provisional ballots. All the compendium coming together. Students were showing up, and their names were not on the actual roll. Um, and so they were casting provisional ballots, so much so that they actually ran out of provisional ballots. It was just out of control. We knew people were trying to be heard, but I also knew they weren't being listened to. Election night... I knew something had gone horribly wrong. Take a look at where the numbers stand right now. As you can see, the numbers are now tightening. The spread is only some 60,000. Several counties have yet to process their provisional and emergency ballots, leaving an estimated 22,000 ballots outstanding. By 1:00 a.m., what we knew was that the race was too close to call. I'm here tonight to tell you votes remain to be counted. There are voices that were waiting to be heard. Across our state, folks are opening up the dreams of voters in absentee ballots, and we believe our chance for a stronger Georgia is just within reach. But we cannot seize it until all voices are heard. And I promise you tonight, we are gonna make sure that every vote is counted. Every single vote. We've heard from 40,000 Georgians and counting who have told us story after story about the concerns and problems they have, uh, with our system across Georgia. Our staff was, you know, running around the state and collecting all of these stories, and we're in the federal courts fighting for each of these votes. Every day, there were votes that were found, and there were lawsuits that were settled that then added to the total. And it was just a devastating, obvious thing what happened. You couldn't swing a bat and not hit 14 people who had problems voting. Governor Nathan Deal rolled out the gubernatorial red carpet Thursday for Brian Kemp, declaring him governor-elect, though the state has yet officially to certify the election. Even if she got 100% of those votes, we still win with, um, a 50%-plus-one-vote majority. Actually, it's much more than that. Uh, so we're moving forward with the transition. Brian Kemp is 25,622 votes above the threshold for a runoff election. 25,000 votes of nearly four million cast are at issue in this race. By his own admission, there are at least 25,000 outstanding votes and hundreds, if not thousands, of more that we are learning about and discovering every day. Georgians deserve to have their votes counted. And some Abrams supporters protested peacefully outside the governor's office during Kemp's news conference, believing there are enough uncounted votes to force a runoff. They're arresting me because I refused to leave the rotunda of the capitol... Well, I was taken out in handcuffs and jailed because I stood with my constituents to voice their concerns and make sure that every vote is counted. By the end, we were still 17,000 votes shy of the runoff. The ballot battle in Georgia's governor's race is over. Brian Kemp will be certified the winner. I was very angry. I'm still very angry. Um... ...very angry. Make no mistake. The former Secretary of State was deliberate and intentional in his actions. Pundits and hyper-partisans will hear my words as a rejection of the normal order. You see, I'm supposed to say nice things and accept my fate. They will complain that I should not use this moment to recap what was done wrong or to demand a remedy. You see, as a leader, I should be stoic in my outrage and silent in my rebuke. But stoicism is a luxury, and silence is a weapon for those who would quiet the voices of the people. And I will not concede, because the erosion of our democracy is not right. Last night, as you all know, my opponent ended her campaign. The election is over, and I'm honored to be Georgia's governor-elect. My responsibility as the daughter of Robert and Carolyn Abrams, as the granddaughter of people who had been denied the right to vote, as the great-great- granddaughter of slaves, my job was to use this election to talk about the system that let this be. And so, we decided on that night that we were going to demand that the system itself be fixed. Because, when you concede, what you're saying is that the system worked the way it was supposed to. And I refuse to believe that a system that is supposed to protect our democracy worked the way it was supposed to. In 2020 and beyond, the way we fight voter suppression is by meeting it where it is. That means, first and foremost, volunteer to help people get registered to vote. Hi, Nina, darling. My name is Stacey Abrams. I wanted to thank you for all the work you're doing to reach out to voters and making sure they stay on the rolls. If you believe in "one person, one vote," if you believe in representative government, then you will fight for this democracy. So, if you, um, fill it out right now, we can mail it out for you. Our power is in our vote. Our power is in our voice. And if we willingly choose to remain silent, we give up that power. The day that we celebrate what it means to be an American. Today, our returning citizens have their right to vote restored. Plan out what you're going to do to make sure your ballot is cast and counted, and then ask your friends and family whether they have a plan. Even if you've done everything right, do not assume you're registered. Check to make sure that you haven't been purged or that your polling place has moved. Vote as early as possible. Take your friends with you to the polls. Talk to your neighbors about voting. Call your parents and ask them if they've voted. Call your grandparents. And make sure that people know what precinct they're in, where their polling location is. And then you turn up at the polls, and you don't leave until you cast your ballot. They told voters to anticipate long lines. Is two and a half hours, three hours, four hours... is that reasonable, though, in your mind, David? It's worth the wait. It's worth the wait. Folks died for this right that... I mean, you know, so I would never take advantage of it, you know, so... I'm here for the long haul. It's a life-and-death matter. It really is. It's not gonna be the courts that save us. It's not gonna be the justices in their robes. It's got to be the people. If you were to come out to vote, we could elect who we wanted to, we could get done what we wanted to, and we could make sure that our voice was heard. The fight for voting rights needs to be a defining civil rights issue today. The desire to keep certain people away from the polls, it's a reality that we have to be prepared to confront. But unless we confront that reality and base actions on that reality, we won't make the progress that we all want to make in this country. I believe in our democracy. I believe in our nation. And I think our strongest patriotism is a patriotism that says that every voice matters and that every vote counts and that we will do everything in our power to make it so. Let's stop thinking that our voice don't matter... - That's right. - ...and vote! Educate yourself and know who you're voting for. Because it's a lot of us. - It's a lot of us. - That's right. It's a lot of us! It's a lot of us! ♪ The table 'bout to turn ♪ ♪ The table 'bout to turn ♪ Register to vote. Even if you think you're already registered, check your registration status.
