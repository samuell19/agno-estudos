Boy: FREEZE! YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! Second Boy: YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME. GOTCHA! NO WAY. First Boy: YOU CAN'T HURT ME, I'M WEARING MY VEST. I'VE GOT SPECIAL BULLETS. HEY! I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. WAIT RIGHT HERE! HEY, YOU NEED ANY HELP? HI. I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON THE COMPUTER. NO, JUST GOOFING AROUND. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU COULD HELP ME CUT SOME CARROTS. I FORGOT TO ASK YOU-- HMM? HAVE YOU TALKED TO LIEUTENANT RUNYON ABOUT NOVEMBER? YEAH. HE SAID IT'S TOO EARLY TO MAKE ANY KIND OF COMMITMENT. TOO MANY HIGH-PRIORITY CASES, NOT ENOUGH MAN-POWER, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. Woman: HERE, LET ME HAVE THOSE. Man: MMM. SMELLS GOOD! HOW MUCH LONGER? WHAT IS IT? IT'S A SECRET. SO YOU STILL WANT TO GO TO THE GRAND CANYON? YEAH, WE COULD START THERE. START THERE? WHAT, ARE WE GONNA TAKE A TOUR OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES? THIS IS THE GUN DAD USES TO CATCH REAL CROOKS. YOU'RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE. OH! HOT! HOT! BUT IT'S GOT THOSE LITTLE ONIONS I LIKE. TASTE GOOD? MM-HMM. MAYBE A LITTLE SALT. DAD SAYS I'M GONNA BE A POLICEMAN ONE DAY, JUST LIKE HIM. IS IT LOADED? NAH. DON'T THINK SO. YOU KNOW, TAKE THE BULLETS OUT AT THE POLICE STATION. SEE? IT DOESN'T WORK. DO YOU THINK JEFFREY WANTS TO STAY FOR DINNER? I DON'T KNOW. I'LL ASK HIM. THEY'RE OUT THERE PLAYING. YEAH. I'LL CALL HIS MOM. WHAT'S THIS DO? KEVIN! [GUNSHOT] NO! [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] YEAH. Man: WE'VE GOT A DOUBLE HOMICIDE AT 24th AND GRAMERCY. SORRY TO WAKE YOU LIKE THIS. YEAH. GIVE ME 10 MINUTES TO GET DRESSED. Officer: MA'AM, I KNOW THIS IS VERY TRAUMATIC, BUT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW OUR STANDARD PROCEDURES. CASS. MURDER-SUICIDE. CHEERY WAY TO START THE DAY, HUH? YEP. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP? WERE THEY HAVING ANY KIND OF FINANCIAL PROBLEMS? THEY GOT NAMES? WILLIAM AND PRISCILLA VACCARO. WHAT ABOUT THE WATERWORKS OUTSIDE? FEMALE VICTIM'S SISTER DISCOVERED THE BODIES. M.E. AND FORENSICS SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE. I HATE WORKING THESE SPOUSAL HOMICIDES. ANOTHER FIGHT WITH YOUR EX, HUH? THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. JUST DEPRESSES ME THAT THOSE 2 PEOPLE IN THERE STOOD BEFORE GOD AND PROMISED TO LOVE EACH OTHER FOREVER. DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT GOD. THIS SHIT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IF PEOPLE LEARNED HOW TO CONTROL THEIR EMOTIONS. I CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT. SEE YOU LATER. [CLUNK] SORRY. HI. I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T DO THIS. YOU CAN'T DO WHAT, OLIVIA? CAN'T MAKE LOVE TO YOUR OWN HUSBAND? IF WE HAVE SEX, EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE. ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I THINK. YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU ANYMORE. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT? I WANT OUR SON BACK. WELL, HE'S NOT COMING BACK. AND NOTHING YOU SAY OR DO IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT. THE SOONER YOU REALIZE THAT, THE SOONER YOU CAN GET ON WITH YOUR OWN LIFE. IT'S BEEN A YEAR. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. AND IN ALL THAT TIME, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE CEMETERY, GRIFF. NOT ONCE. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? ENOUGH. GRIFF, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE A LONG TIME AGO. NO! NO! NO! PUT IT BACK! OLIVIA! OLIVIA! NO! OLIVIA! STOP IT! LET GO OF ME. GRIFF. I'M LEAVING. I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU, OLIVIA. NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK, I STILL LOVE YOU VERY MUCH. IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL THIS, AN ACT OF LOVE? CHRIST. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I JUST KNOW WE CAN'T KEEP LIVING LIKE THIS ANYMORE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE. YOU LEFT A LONG TIME AGO, ANYWAY. YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU? THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME. THIS IS ABOUT YOU. THINGS ARE NEVER GOING TO BE RIGHT BETWEEN US TILL YOU STOP BLAMING ME FOR KEVIN'S DEATH. THAT IS NOT TRUE! OH, IT IS TRUE! YOU THROW IT IN MY FACE EVERY DAY WITH THAT SHRINE IN THERE! WHAT I BLAME YOU FOR IS NOT BEING THERE FOR ME WHEN I NEEDED YOU THE MOST. GRIFF, AFTER THE ACCIDENT, IT WAS LIKE YOU SHUT DOWN. I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING. YOU WANTED ME NOT TO FEEL ANYTHING, TOO. AND I CAN'T DO THAT. I'M NOT A MACHINE. HE WAS MY SON. I KNOW. AND I LOVED HIM. AND I MOURN FOR HIM. BUT I WILL BE GODDAMNED IF I'M GOING TO MOURN MY LIFE AWAY. WHAT'S WITH YOU TODAY? YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT. OH, NO. YOU TELL ME NOW, OR TELL ME LATER. YOU'RE A PAIN IN THE ASS, YOU KNOW THAT? I KNOW. NOW SING. I MOVED OUT LAST NIGHT. NOW, THAT WAS A DUMBASS THING TO DO. CHRIST. THIS FROM A WOMAN WHO'S STILL PAYING OFF HER DIVORCE LAWYER. YES, I LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES. CORONER'S REPORT OF THE VACCAROS. THANKS, BENNY. Benny: JUST CAME IN. WELL? THE CORONER REPORTS THAT THE MURDER-SUICIDE IS PROBABLE CAUSES OF DEATH. ALL RIGHT. LET'S PUT THIS PUPPY TO BED. WELL, I'D BE HAPPY TO, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. WHAT'S THAT? I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS A MURDER-SUICIDE. ANOTHER GRIFF HUNCH? YOU'VE EARNED THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. LET'S HEAR IT. ALL RIGHT. PRISCILLA VACCARO WAS FACING HER ATTACKER WHEN SHE WAS SHOT. YEAH. SO? SO, HOW MANY OF THESE SPOUSE SHOOTINGS HAVE WE INVESTIGATED? ENOUGH. EXACTLY. AND HOW MANY TIMES WAS THE VICTIM SHOT FROM THE FRONT? I'D HAVE TO LOOK IT UP. DON'T BOTHER. I ALREADY DID. ALMOST NEVER. EITHER THEY'RE SHOT WHILE THEY WERE ASLEEP, OR THEY'RE SHOT FROM BEHIND, WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME, 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO AWAY WITH THE PERSON THAT YOU SHARED YOUR BED, YOUR LIFE WITH, THE ODDS ARE THE LAST THING YOU WANNA BE DOING IS LOOKING THEM IN THE EYE WHEN YOU PULL THE TRIGGER. ONLY A COLD-BLOODED KILLER COULD DO THAT. I JUST DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO QUICK TO, UH, CLOSE THE BOOKS ON THIS. AM I YOUR WHORE, TEDDY? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE HAVE SEX, AND THEN YOU GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE. WHAT ELSE DO YOU CALL IT? YOU KNOW I DON'T LOVE HER. THEN WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE HER? LOOK, I'VE EXPLAINED ALL THIS TO YOU. IF I DID THAT, IT'D BE FINANCIAL SUICIDE. IF YOU LOVE ME, TEDDY, IF YOU REALLY LOVE ME... MY WIFE HAS ME BY THE BALLS. IF I DIVORCE HER, I LOSE EVERYTHING. WELL... TEDDY... THERE IS ANOTHER WAY. HARLAN? SO? NO PROBLEMS. I LOVE YOU, ANGEL. I LOVE YOU, TOO. MMM MMM! GOOD GIRL. TELL ME SOMETHING. WHEN YOU'RE WITH THOSE OTHER MEN, HMM? ARE YOU THINKING OF ME? I COULDN'T DO IT OTHERWISE. GOOD. IT DRIVES ME CRAZY... THINKING OF YOU WITH ANOTHER MAN. PART OF ME WANTS TO BUST RIGHT IN THERE AND STRANGLE THEM ON THE SPOT. BUT I REMEMBER THAT IT'S ALL FOR THE GREATER GOOD. AND THAT WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE... YOU'RE MINE. OLIVIA, YOU HAVE A VISITOR. HEY. SORRY TO BARGE IN ON YOU LIKE THIS. HOW YOU DOING? OK. HANGING IN THERE. YEAH, ME, TOO. LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. YOU GOT A MINUTE? ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST SIT OVER HERE. YOU KNOW, IT'S, UH, IT'S BENNY AND JANICE'S WEDDING ON THE 12th, AND WE TOLD THEM WE'D GO, SO, UH, I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO BECAUSE IF YOU STILL WANT TO GO, I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE WE'D GO TOGETHER TO AVOID ANY KIND OF AWKWARDNESS OR EMBARRASSMENT. IS THAT WHAT YOU REALLY CAME HERE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT? YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT JUST CAME UP. WE GOTTA LET THEM KNOW. GRIFF, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA. WHY? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A COUPLE RIGHT NOW, AND IF WE START PRETENDING THAT WE ARE, IT'LL JUST CONFUSE THINGS. LOOK, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T GO, OK? IT'LL BE EASIER ON EVERYBODY. JEEZ, OLIVIA, WHERE'S THE HARM IN US JUST BEING TOGETHER FOR A LITTLE BIT? THE HARM IS OF US BEING TOGETHER JUST WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR YOU. IT JUST HURTS TOO MUCH FOR ME TO DO THAT, GRIFF. YOU KNOW, THINGS NEED TO CHANGE FIRST, AND UNTIL THEY DO... I'M SORRY. Woman: I DON'T KNOW, TEDDY. MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF. NO, I WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT. I JUST WANT TO BE SURE I CAN TRUST THIS GUY. WELL, I DON'T KNOW, HE, UM... I TOLD YOU HE'S AN EX-MARINE, AND HE'S A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN'S. OH, HE CAN DO IT. HE CAN. LET'S NOT WASTE ANYBODY'S TIME, HUH? IS THERE A NIGHT NEXT WEEK WHEN YOUR WIFE IS HOME ALONE? THURSDAYS, THURSDAY. OK. HERE'S THE DEAL. ON THURSDAY NEXT, I DELIVER YOU ONE DEAD WIFE. I'LL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SHE WAS KILLED DURING A ROBBERY ATTEMPT, NICE AND NEAT, NO LOOSE ENDS. I NEED A RECENT PHOTO OF HER, A KEY TO YOUR HOUSE, THE SECURITY CODE, AND $250,000. YOU CAN AFFORD IT. INSURANCE ALONE WILL COVER IT AND MUCH MORE. IT'S A SWEET DEAL. YOU GET EVERYTHING YOU WANT, A CLEAN BREAK FROM YOUR WIFE, MOST OF ALL THE MONEY AND THAT GORGEOUS CREATURE IN YOUR CAR OVER THERE. ARE YOU GONNA WALK AWAY FROM IT OVER A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS? BECAUSE I WILL NOT PASS THIS WAY AGAIN. ARE YOU IN? YEAH. GOOD. NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY, BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT ABOUT THE GUNSHOTS, BUT I'M NOT SURE YOU GOT A CASE HERE. LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU THINGS DON'T ADD UP. LIKE THE MURDER WEAPON. IT'S HOCKED. THE DEALER WAS SOME PUNK FROM BOYLE HEIGHTS. BOYLE HEIGHTS, SO WHAT? SO HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE AN ARMANI SUIT SLUMMING DOWN IN BOYLE HEIGHTS FOR A .38, HUH? WHO KNOWS WHY ANYBODY DOES ANYTHING ANYMORE? WHAT ELSE YOU GOT? LOOK AT THOSE. MMM! GIVES THIS MONTH'S CENTERFOLD A RUN FOR HER MONEY. HMMPH. WHERE'D YOU GET THESE? VACARRO'S OFFICE, UNDER LOCK AND KEY, APPARENTLY FOR PRIVATE VIEWING ONLY. SO HE WAS HAVING SOME TAIL ON THE SLY. WHAT'S IT PROVE? WHAT IT PROVES IS THAT NO BALDING MIDDLE-AGED MILLIONAIRE GETTING FUCKING TAIL LIKE THAT IS GONNA PUT A BULLET IN HIS OWN BRAIN. AND ON TOP OF THAT, THE GUY'S GOT A $2-MILLION LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON HIS WIFE. SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD REASON TO CAP HER. YEAH. AND 2 MILLION REASONS NOT TO CAP HIMSELF. YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET. THIS IS GRIFF'S PLAY. OK. SO WHAT'S YOUR GUT SAY? NO WAY THIS IS MURDER-SUICIDE. IT'S DOUBLE HOMICIDE. [WATER RUNNING] WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME? I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN VEGAS. MY PLANS CHANGED. WHY? THEY JUST CHANGED, THAT'S ALL. HEH! YOU'RE IN A PISSY MOOD. WHAT HAPPENED? YOUR LITTLE TRAMP DIDN'T SHOW UP? AAH! SORRY. TOOK LONGER THAN I EXPECTED. SHE WASN'T HOME WHEN I GOT HERE. I HAD TO WAIT AROUND. [SOBBING] GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE? IT'S BETTER IF YOU DON'T LOOK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? OHH! I TOLD YOU TO WAIT IN THE CAR. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KEEPING WATCH. YOU--YOU WERE TAKING SO LONG, I GOT WORRIED. [GUNSHOT] COME ON, LET'S GO. YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE, NIKKI. YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN THAT. YEAH, THINK OF THE MONEY, BABY. THAT'S FREEDOM. THAT'S POWER. OH, THAT'S THE GOOD LIFE, AND IT'S ALL IN THAT BRIEFCASE JUST WAITING FOR US. THAT'S GOOD. YOU THINK ON THAT, OK? AND NOTHING ELSE, ANGEL. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HOMICIDE. McCLEARY. HEY, POPS, WHAT'S UP? WHAT? UH-HUH. GOT IT. TELL ME SOMETHING. HOW WAS SHE SHOT? ALL RIGHT. TALK TO YOU SOON. BYE. WE GOT ANOTHER MURDER-SUICIDE, THIS ONE UP IN SANTA BARBARA. UH, SOME FAT CAT NAMED TED GALLOWAY AND HIS WIFE. HOLY SHIT. WE'RE GONNA COORDINATE OUR INVESTIGATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT UP THERE. OH, BY THE WAY, GALLOWAY'S WIFE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE HEART FROM THE FRONT. Harlan: AND THAT, OF COURSE, IS A DIRECT FLIGHT? PALM BEACH. THAT'S THE FLIGHT NUMBER? AND IT IS AN OPEN RETURN? THANK YOU. INDEED. HARLAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU SAID WE WERE DRIVING TO MEXICO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MEXICO, NOT JUST YET. WELL, WHERE ARE WE GOING, THEN? WELL, I'M GOING TO PALM BEACH. AND YOU... I'M TRUSTING YOU TO STAY HERE AND ENJOY YOURSELF UNTIL I GET BACK. WHAT ABOUT OUR PLANS? OUR PLANS HAVE CHANGED. ONE MORE BIG PAY DAY, AND WE WILL BE ON EASY STREET. ONE MORE? NO, NO, YOU SAID THIS WAS THE LAST ONE, RIGHT? YOU PROMISED. I KNOW, I'M SORRY. I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU. PALM BEACH COULD BE PRIME TERRITORY FOR US, BUT I NEED TO CHECK IT OUT FIRST BEFORE WE MAKE THE COMMITMENT. NO, I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T--I CAN'T DO IT, I CAN'T DO IT! AFTER LAST NIGHT, I CAN'T-- LOOK, ANGEL, THE WAY YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW IS TO BE EXPECTED. THE FIRST TIME YOU EXPERIENCE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS VERY UPSETTING. LOOK, CAN'T WE JUST GO SOMEWHERE NICE? ANYWHERE, JUST--DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MEXICO, OK? SOMEWHERE WE CAN BE TOGETHER. IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW, NIKKI. OUR FINANCES, THEY WON'T PERMIT IT. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST TIME. YOU PROMISED! YOU LIED! GOD, YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME. WHAT, IS THAT-- IS THAT A LIE, TOO? HUH? HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE YOU MET ME? YOU WERE SCREWING YOUR WAY TO OBLIVION. YOU HAD NOTHING. YOU WERE GOING NOWHERE. BUT NOW YOU'RE A LADY OF BEAUTY AND STYLE AND CLASS. PEOPLE NOTICE YOU. WHEN YOU WALK INTO A ROOM, HEADS TURN. I'VE SEEN IT. YOU BRING MEN OF MEANS TO THEIR KNEES. THEY WORSHIP YOU, THEY KILL FOR YOU. THEY EVEN DIE FOR YOU. NOW I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH. AND IF YOU DOUBT THAT, YOU HURT ME. VERY MUCH.

WORK'S ALL I CAN COUNT ON THESE DAYS. THE REST OF MY LIFE IS PRETTY MUCH FUCKED. OH, GALLOWAY'S PHONE RECORDS SHOWS MULTIPLE CALLS TO SAME CELL PHONE NUMBER, INCLUDING 3 TIMES ON THE DAY HE DIED. WE TRIED HOOKING UP WITH THE CELL'S OWNER, BUT IT SEEMS THE NAME ON THE CONTRACT IS FAKE, THE BILLING ADDRESS IS A P.O. BOX IN VENTURA, SAME PHONY NAME. YOU PUT A TRACE ON THE PHONE?

THANKS. LISTEN, IF YOU CAN FAX THIS INFORMATION TO MY PARTNER DETECTIVE IVES AT THE NUMBER I GAVE YOU, I'D APPRECIATE IT. GLAD TO DO IT, MY FRIEND. OH, YEAH. AND I HOPE THIS HAS BEEN A BIG HELP TO YOU. YES, SIR, YOU HAVE BEEN MORE THAN HELPFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [HANGS UP PHONE] GOT YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH. HEY YA, SLINKY, I GOT YOU A DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER. YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M DOING THIS ANYMORE. I MEAN, YOU DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD I SAY. YOU THINK IT'S PERFECTLY OK TO GO RUNNING OFF TO YUCAIPA BEHIND MY BACK. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF SOMEBODY SAW YOU IN THAT HOUSE? YOU WERE JUST DAMN LUCKY. I'M TELLING YOU I AM THIS CLOSE TO JUST GIVING UP ON YOU ENTIRELY. YOU KNOW WHAT, CASSIE? GIVE IT A REST, HUH? WE'VE ALREADY HAD THIS CONVERSATION. WHAT THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES, HUH? HERE'S THE SKINNY ON THAT HARLAN MOSS CHARACTER. YOU STILL INTERESTED? HE WAS THE SOLE HEIR TO A REAL ESTATE FORTUNE. AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT HE THOUGHT, ANYWAY. 5 YEARS AGO, HIS MOTHER AND FATHER WERE FOUND DEAD IN THEIR BEDROOM, VICTIMS OF AN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE. MOM HAD A HOLE IN HER CHEST, DAD HAD A BULLET IN HIS HEAD. AND A STOLEN GUN IN HIS HAND? STAMFORD P.D. SMELLED A RAT FROM THE GET-GO. HARLAN WAS EVERYBODY'S PRIME SUSPECT. I MEAN, HE CERTAINLY HAD THE PERFECT MOTIVE. WITH HIS PARENTS GONE, ALL THE MONEY WAS HIS. BUT CHARGES WERE NEVER FILED. THE EVIDENCE JUST WASN'T THERE. THEY COULDN'T MAKE A CASE. AFTER THAT, HIS LUCK RAN OUT. THE INHERITANCE DIDN'T EVEN COVER HIS PARENTS' DEBTS. HE TOOK OFF FOR PARTS UNKNOWN, HASN'T BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE. THERE WAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF NEWS COVERAGE AT THE TIME. STAMFORD P.D. IS SEARCHING THE ARCHIVES TO SEND US A PHOTO. WHAT'S HE WAITING FOR, CASS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I MEAN, IF HE WANTED TO KILL ME, THE GUY'S HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY. HELL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. HE COULD HAVE WALKED UP TO ME ON THAT STREET, PUMPED A ROUND IN MY GUT, AND I'D HAVE NEVER SEEN IT COMING. HE'S LETTING YOU SWEAT A LITTLE FIRST, GETTING HIS ROCKS OFF. NAH. HE'S SMARTER THAN THAT. THE GUY'S A MAGGOT, BUT HE'S NOT A FOOL. I'M MISSING SOMETHING. [DOORBELL RINGS] HI. HI. OH... YOU LOOK VERY NICE. OH, THANK YOU. THOUGHT THIS WASN'T A DATE. IT'S NOT. FOR A DATE, I BRING ROSES. HA HA HA HA. THANK YOU. SURE. UM, DO YOU WANT TO COME IN? I'LL PUT THESE IN WATER. SO, DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO EAT? WELL, I'VE BEEN GIVING THIS DINNER SOME THOUGHT. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ITALIAN? THAT SOUNDS GREAT. GOOD. 'CAUSE I'VE DISCOVERED THIS REALLY NICE LITTLE SPOT IN THE WEST VALLEY. TERRIFIC. [DOORBELL RINGS] UH, EXCUSE ME. THAT'S KIND OF ODD. HOLD ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I JUST GOT THIS LETTER FROM YOUR DIVORCE ATTORNEY, THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING HERE. LOOK, GRIFF, NOT NOW. WHOSE CAR IS OUT HERE? WHAT, DO YOU GOT A DATE? THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. AW, THAT'S GREAT, OLIVIA. WHY NOT LET ME MEET THIS GUY? NO, GRIFF. RIGHT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? I WOULDN'T WANT TO SPOIL YOUR BIG NIGHT WITH SOMETHING AS INCONSEQUENTIAL AS THIS. IF YOU THINK THIS IS EASY FOR ME, THEN YOU ARE WRONG. GOD DAMN IT, OLIVIA. ARE YOU REALLY GONNA GO THROUGH WITH THIS? I DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE. I MESSED UP, OLIVIA. I... I LOST MY JOB, AND NOW I'M LOSING YOU, AND... I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT. I'LL GO ANYWHERE YOU WANT. I'LL--JUST... JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE. YOU JUST WANT ME TO CLOSE MY EYES AND PRETEND THAT NOTHING EVER HAPPENED? I CAN'T DO THAT. YOU LOOK ME IN THE EYES RIGHT NOW AND YOU TELL ME YOU DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE, AND I'LL WALK OUT OF HERE. I'M NOT GONNA PLAY THAT GAME, GRIFF. WE'RE STILL MARRIED. YOU TELL YOUR DATE THAT. THAT WAS MY HUSBAND. I'M SORRY. IS EVERYTHING OK? YEAH. I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN. I JUST DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT. I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE GOING OUT. MAYBE WE COULD JUST STAY HERE AND I COULD MAKE SANDWICHES AND COFFEE. SURE. SHOW ME TO THE KNIFE. I'LL SLICE THE BREAD. I WAS A WIFE AND MOTHER, AND I THOUGHT THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS ALWAYS GONNA BE. I WASN'T PREPARED FOR THIS. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IF I WERE A RELIGIOUS PERSON, I'D BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THESE THINGS HAPPEN THE WAY THEY DO. ALL I KNOW IS THAT LOSING MY SON THAT WAY JUST... IT'S LIKE A NIGHTMARE THAT JUST NEVER SEEMS TO END. WELL, THEY SAY TIME SUPPOSEDLY HEALS ALL WOUNDS. SO, TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED? YEAH. I HAVE. STRANGELY ENOUGH, SHE PASSED AWAY QUITE RECENTLY. OH, I AM SO SORRY. IT HAPPENED, AND... I WAS POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SHE MEANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO ME. AND I CAN DEFINITELY SAY THAT I LOVED HER. WITH ALL MY HEART. [BOTH LAUGHING] YEAH, WELL, OLIVIA, THANK YOU. I MUST SAY, THAT WAS ABOUT AS PLEASANT AN EVENING AS I'VE HAD IN A-- YOU TELL HIM WE'RE STILL MARRIED, OLIVIA? GRIFF! HMM? PLEASE, NO. WHAT ARE YOU, A TOUGH GUY? HUH? GRIFF, STOP IT! SHE'S MY WIFE! ARE YOU HURT? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? HOW DARE YOU COME HERE?! GET OUT! GET OUT OF HERE! I'M SO SORRY. IT'S OK. THAT WAS MY HUSBAND. I GUESSED. GOD DAMN IT. GOD DAMN IT! WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING TO ME? GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE, CASS. I'M HURTIN' LIKE HELL. YOU KNOW, I NEVER SAW MY OLD MAN CRY... NOT EVEN WHEN MY MOTHER DIED. I REMEMBER ONE TIME WHEN I WAS... 12, 13 YEARS OLD AND HE CAUGHT ME CRYING. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS CRYING ABOUT. BUT HE JUST-- HE JUST SHUT ME DOWN. I MEAN, HE JUST CAME AND HE JUST SLAPPED THE SNOT OUT OF ME. TOLD ME I WAS WEAK. "BOTTLE IT UP. KEEP IT INSIDE." NEVER CRIED AFTER THAT. WHEN KEVIN DIED... I LET OLIVIA MOURN ALONE. BECAUSE I COULDN'T. I JUST, I... I COULDN'T. I KNEW IF I STARTED, I'D NEVER STOP. AND THEN I PUNISHED HER FOR IT. I JUST WANT TO TAKE IT ALL BACK. MAKE THINGS RIGHT BETWEEN US. I'M NOT THE ONE YOU SHOULD BE TELLING THIS TO, GRIFF. I GOTTA GO. YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA HANG OUT FOR A WHILE. WHAT'S THIS? TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE, OK? HI, JACK. HOW ARE YOU? COULDN'T BE BETTER. HERE FOR SOME MORE CHOCOLATE PIE? NO. I'M HERE TO KIDNAP YOU. WHAT? I'M PLAYING HOOKY FROM WORK. I'D LOVE IT IF YOU COULD JOIN ME. I'M FIXING TO TAKE A WALK ON THE BEACH, MAYBE A MOVIE AFTERWARDS. FORGET LAST NIGHT EVER EVEN HAPPENED. HOW'S THAT SOUND? WELL, I'M NOT EXACTLY DRESSED FOR A WALK ON THE BEACH. THEN WE'LL STOP BY YOUR HOUSE FIRST, SO YOU CAN CHANGE. NO, I CAN'T GO NOW. I MEAN, I STILL HAVE, LIKE, HALF AN HOUR LEFT ON MY SHIFT. COME ON. WE BOTH KNOW YOU DESERVE SOME TIME OFF. OLIVIA, LIVE A LITTLE. I GUESS I COULD ASK ANITA TO LET ME OFF A LITTLE EARLY. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT? OLIVIA, LISTEN TO ME. I JUST TALKED TO ANITA. SHE SAID YOU LEFT WORK EARLY. HONEY, I'VE BEEN TRACKING A KILLER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW. I GOT A POSITIVE I.D. ON HIM. HE'S THE GUY WHO WAS AT THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT, OLIVIA. HE'S USING YOU. HE'S USING YOU TO GET BACK AT ME. IF YOU GET THERE BEFORE I DO, YOU SIT TIGHT. YOU HEAR ME? YOU SIT TIGHT, AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. GOOD. SO, I'LL WAIT OUT HERE. I DON'T WANT TO CROWD YOU. OH, YOU'RE NOT CROWDING ME. I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE. COME ON IN. YOU SURE? OK. YOU KNOW, OLIVIA, I WANTED TO TELL YOU, UH... LAST NIGHT MEANT A LOT TO ME. YOU KNOW, DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED, I HAD A GREAT TIME. UH, CAN I OFFER YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK? OH, SURE. ICE TEA OK? GREAT. OH, I HAVE A MESSAGE. Answering machine: THURSDAY, 2:52 P.M. Griff: OLIVIA, LISTEN TO ME. I JUST TALKED TO ANITA. SHE SAID YOU LEFT WORK EARLY. HONEY, I'VE BEEN TRACKING A KILLER FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW. I GOT A POSITIVE I.D. ON HIM. HE'S THE GUY WHO WAS AT THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT, OLIVIA. HE'S USING YOU. HE'S USING YOU TO GET BACK AT ME. IF YOU GET THERE BEFORE I DO, YOU SIT TIGHT, YOU HEAR ME? YOU SIT TIGHT, AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. Machine: [BEEPS] END OF MESSAGES. GOD. HE'S A DESPERATE MAN, ISN'T HE? I GUESS HE'LL RESORT TO ANYTHING TO GET YOU BACK. CAN'T SAY I BLAME HIM. BUT, I MEAN, TRYING TO SCARE YOU WITH ALL THOSE TERRIBLE LIES HE JUST SAID ABOUT ME? I NEVER THOUGHT HE'D RESORT TO ANYTHING SO DESPICABLE. GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF, OLIVIA. I'M REALLY CONCERNED FOR YOU. WHAT? YOU DON'T BELIEVE HIM, DO YOU? OHH...AAH! MMM...MMM...MMM... [TELEPHONE RINGS ON OTHER END] Olivia: HI, YOU'VE REACHED THE McCLEARY RESIDENCE. PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE BEEP. [BEEP] SHIT. HUHH! MMM...MMM... MMM...MMM... TOSS THE GUN. [WHIMPERS] I SAID TOSS IT, OR I'LL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF RIGHT HERE AND NOW. BACK UP. LET OLIVIA GO. THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND ME. YOU'RE WRONG. THIS IS BETWEEN ME AND YOU... AND NIKKI. YOU SEE, COP, YOU DESTROYED THE ONLY THING I EVER REALLY LOVED. MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO KILL YOU STONE DEAD. BUT THEN I REALIZED YOU HAD TO LIVE... SO YOU COULD FEEL YOUR SHARE OF THE PAIN. KNOWING YOU'D NEVER SEE YOUR WOMAN AGAIN, EVER FEEL THE WARMTH OF HER SOFT SKIN. [SHUDDERS] OR KISS THAT SWEET, SWEET SPOT AT THE BACK OF HER NECK. AND THE AGONY OF KNOWING THAT ANOTHER MAN SEDUCED HER, HAD HER, AND KILLED HER. JUST LIKE YOU DID MY NIKKI. YOU WANNA KNOW WHO KILLED YOUR WIFE? THEN LOOK IN THE MIRROR, PAL. BECAUSE YOU USED HER. YOU USED HER, AND YOU TORE HER UP, AND SHE COULDN'T LIVE WITH THE GUILT. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT? LOOK IN YOUR OWN DAMN MIRROR. SEE WHAT A FUCKED-UP MESS YOU'VE BECOME. YOU'LL SEE THAT YOUR MARRIAGE IS AS DEAD AS YOUR KID. FUCK YOU. YOU SEE, IF ALL HAD GONE ACCORDING TO PLAN, I'D HAVE HAD MY WAY WITH HER TONIGHT... AND THEN, WITH GREAT SATISFACTION, PUT A BULLET QUIETLY THROUGH HER HEART, SO YOU COULD FIND HER TOMORROW. BUT NOW THINGS JUST GOT BETTER. BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE HER DIE. AND I GET TO LEAVE YOU HERE WITH A BULLET IN EACH LEG TO THINK ABOUT THE HORROR YOUR LIFE HAS BECOME. FUNNY HOW--UHH! YOU SON OF A BITCH. MMM...MMM... YOU ALL RIGHT? DID HE HURT YOU? NO. OHH! UHH! LISTEN TO ME. YOU TAKE THIS, AND YOU STAY IN THIS ROOM. YOU DON'T MOVE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEAR. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? OK. ALL RIGHT. OH, SH... [OLIVIA SOBS] YOU OK? DON'T MOVE. OH, OLIVIA. I'M DISAPPOINTED. AFTER ALL WE SHARED LAST NIGHT? WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM HOW WE HELD HANDS AND POURED OUT OUR HEARTS TO ONE ANOTHER? THAT'S NOT TRUE! ENOUGH. KILL ME. KILL ME LIKE YOU KILLED NIKKI. LIKE YOU KILLED YOUR OWN SON. COME ON. YOU KNOW YOU WANNA DO IT. YOU HATE ME. I'M TAKING YOU IN, HARLAN. I DON'T THINK SO. UH-UH. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET THROUGH ANOTHER DAY WITH ME AROUND-- A LIVING TESTIMONY TO YOUR SIN. AHH! Harlan: [LAUGHS] OH, COME ON. COME ON, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. YOU'RE A KILLER, LIKE ME. DON'T YOU DO IT. I'LL SEE YOU... I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL, BROTHER. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY CONCORDE-NEW HORIZONS CORPORATION
