Produced by Nikkatsu Inc. Produced by Nikkatsu Film Studio Red Rope- Until We Expire How is it? Does it feel good? How is it? I can't take it anymore... Hurry up and fuck me! What's wrong? Did something happen at work? Nothing, really. I even got a contract from a university hospital today. I guess I'm just tired. It hurts! It hurts! Stop! Sorry. Do you want to be tied up? Tied up? No, nevermind. Stop! I can't breathe! The cause was a terrorrist bombing. The police are investigating the relationship with the company... Now for today's weather. Tokyo, sunny. Kanagawa, sunny, but in the mountain areas rain is possible. Saitama, sunny. Honey! It's time to take the bus! Yes! Here. I am leaving! See you! Your master is... Welcome back! How is it going? You reek of alcohol! Oh? Are you too clean forthat? People say beautiful girls are obsessed with cleanliness. Did something happen at work? Hisako! What happened to the videotape I put here? You saw it, didn't you? The illegal porno tape! I threw it away. Again? I even paid 30,000! You paid 30,000 forthat lame video tape? Lame? Did you watch it? I was just curious. How was it? You got wet, didn't you? Can I take a bath? Go ahead. Join me. Alone it is, then. Honey... Do you really like that kind of stuff? It's not that big of a deal! Just stimulation, you know! Hisako! What are you doing? How is it? You're getting excited, don't you? Don't be ridiculous. Imagine you are tied up and naked. You don't want to get assaulted for real... but you get excited... if it's just some kind of play. I am raping you. I am a dirty guy. Just a little, okay? Don't make it too painful, okay? It's love. Love. I do this because I love you. I heard most women are born as masochists. We are a married couple, aren't we? Just think of this as some kind of foreplay. You look beautiful, Hisako. This much already? As I expected. You must be... What? You are a masochist. Is this the reason you married me? Is it? No way! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! Let's talk when I come back tonight. I am already late forwork! - Why didn't you wake me up? - I did! You just didn't wake up! - Whatever! - Honey! Excuse me... What is it? I thought you were someone else. Sorry. Scream louder! Scream louder! Honey... Yosuke... A regular-speed train headed to Urahara is arriving. Please stand in front of the line. Yes. Aftervisiting the Marubishi Corporation... Yes. Understood. Thank you. I called Marubishi, and they told me you didn't show up. Where are you now? I mean... What the hell are you up to while everybody else is working? Come back to the office right now! Understood. Dear customers, an event will be held from the 17th to 19th. Thank you for your cooperation. An umbrella. You can have it. My home is not faraway. Nami Tsuchiya. What is this? You surprised me! Take this to the cleaner. You can tie me up if you want. Ljust want to talk some more. If we don't... Don't make a big deal out of it! It's just bondage! I'll control my desires so there's no problem. Please take my words seriously. I'm not some pervert who only gets excited when I tie someone up. It's pathetic. Is it my fault? I am saying a married couple can... Is it my fault? Hisako... I've wanted to do this. It has been my dream since I was a child. I've wanted a woman who would understand my taste. I will come home as early as possible tonight. Isn't it hard to prepare meals every day? Let's have some sushi tonight. See you. Be careful! I can't take it anymore. I am going back to my hometown in Osaka. We haven't been together for a long time... but I think this is the best option for both of us. I hope you find a perverted woman who shares your tastes. I brought your suit to the cleaner. It's Omachi Cleaning in 1-Chome. Your underwear is in the second drawer. Other clothing items are in the clothing case. Also, there are ready-made meals in the fridge. Hey, Nonaka! Where are you going? Let's have another round! Let's rock it! What's wrong? You've been weird recently! Hello, this is the SM Club Whip's Palace. Hello! Well... Do you want S or M? Hello? Well... Hey! Are you teasing me? Idiot! Mister! We have cute girls! I'm Akina. Thank you forcoming. Wow, it's big! But it doesn't look healthy. Let me massage it a little. Lie down. That hurts! Be nice! Let me tie you up. I think I can't help it. Huh? Are you sick? Why didn't you go to a SM club? How much? How much do I have to pay you? 50,000 more. But you can only tie me up. That's it. I want to do enema as well. Huh? I am leaving! Go see a doctor! What is this? Masturbation only. That's it. 50,000 for masturbation. I know you don't want to go to the police either! Nami Tsuchiya I will be waiting for you at 6PM tomorrow... at the small bridge in the Shinjuku Central Park. I hope this videotape soothes the pain of the rope scar on yourwrist. Yosuke Nonaka I hope this videotape soothes the pain of the rope scar on yourwrist. I hope this videotape soothes the pain of the rope scar on yourwrist. Tsuchiya! Tsuchiya! Yes! What are you thinking? Sorry. What did you do to this document? Well, this is... This shows the sales goal forthis quarter. As you know... we have to change oursales strategy... I'm too late... I guess she just couldn't wait this long. You have been waiting for me! I am Nonaka. Sorry for making you come here. Would you like something to drink? Just talking will do if you want. I am sorry forfollowing you to your house. I am also sorry forgiving you the videotape. But I saw the rope scar on yourwrist. You wrote something about my wrist on your business card. What is that about? I came here today to know what that is about. I don't know where to start. It's complicated. Do you rememberthe otherday? Not the rainy day, the day we first met on the train. I saw the rope scar on yourwrist. I wouldn't do this if you had a boyfriend. I went to your house several times. I knew it was wrong, but I was watching. I was wondering if you were looking forsomeone. The same type of person. So, what are you saying? I want to tie you up. Nami! Since I am a pro, you need to pay. Of course I will pay. I was joking! I think there is a misunderstanding! I don't know what this videotape is about. Take it. If you keep following me, I will call the police! Yes. Sales Department. It's here. Let's go in. The interior is simplerthan I expected. I don't know what to do. Should I take a showerfirst? - No! Don't do it too harshly! - Harshly? Then why did you come in the first place? - You came here to get tied up! - No! I thought you were desperate and I could do something to help you. Stop lying! You followed me all the way! Damn you! With this... Do you want me to cut your stomach open with this? No... No... No... No... No... I will clean it up later. No... No... Fuck me! Hurry up and fuck me! I'm excited. Fuck me! How do you feel? I think yourskills are better than mine. When I was a middle-school student... I found an art nouveau magazine in an old bookshop near my school. I turned the pages casually and found a photo of a bound woman. I bought it. I mimicked it. I thought I was weird, crazy and different from everyone else. I am not interested in men. Actually, I hate men. Why? My mothersuffered a lot because of my father. Because I witnessed that, I am not interested in men. But I have been lonely. I have wished forsomeone who was like me. I have longed forsomeone who would torture me with affection. Would you come to my house? You must have a wife... I'd choose you over her. - No! - Do it! - You look really pretty - No! Don't look! No! Show me yourface! I'm embarassed! No... You look beautiful. - Don't look... Don't look... - You're beautiful! - Hey! Look properly! - No... No! It hurts! It hurts! Think of this as my penis. Not yet? Please do it now. I can't help it anymore. I think I'm going crazy. That's fine! Lose your mind! Hello. Hello? Hisako? Nami... You must be hungry. Really? Really? Yosuke... Nami! What is the date today? Not that it matters. The entire apartment stinks. Don't you think people might complain? Who? Who? The neighbors. Even if we kill ourselves here, they won't notice it because of the maggots. I hate it. It's dirty. It's not. I'd feast on the maggots that devoured your body. We have done it forthe entire week. How about yourwork? Tsuchiya, get some tea. Are you having a private phone call? Tsuchiya, can you call my wife? I am at work. This is how my day goes. How about yourwork, Nonaka? I've already fired, obviously. Nothing can stop me now. Hey... Let's do it... I want us to come together... We have come together. Together... Am I not good enough? Don't you like it? I do, but I'm not sure. Everything might end if we do it. It might become the main reason we are together. You are talking about something like a married couple's relationship? Maybe... I don't want to end my relationship with you. I'm scared. Men and women are different. But I feel sad. I want it badly. It's hot... Don't move. It's dangerous. Really? Keep doing it. Nami... It's hot... Do it! Don't be a coward... I'm a guy whose wife ran away. It's hot... Don't leave me alone. I will never run way from you... Wait here. You! Hisako! I'm sorry. I thought you would be at work at this hour. That's why I didn't ring the doorbell. Why are you here? I already sent the divorce papers. The key... I took the key with me. I wanted to give it back. Here. Where are you staying right now? Aren't you going to... Don't worry. I can manage myself. Wait! This is... I'm glad. You finally found a perverted woman who understands yourtastes! Ordid you cheat on me? Did you? - Did you? - No! Hey! You homewrecker! Don't you feel cold? No, I'm fine. Doesn't the wound hurt? It's been three months already. I think it has become worse. Yes, it hurts a little on nights like this. This might hurt. Does it hurt? No, I'm fine. You can do it more harshly. Okay. I'm doing it. I'll take you down if it gets too dangerous. Hey... Are you enjoying this? Are you enjoying this too? I am. But I'm not sure how long we can do this. Until... we... expire... The sweat-drenched couple are actually angels who lost their halos.
