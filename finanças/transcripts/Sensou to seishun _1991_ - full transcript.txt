~ SENSOU TO SEISHUN ~ ( War And Youth ) Uncle! Hi! Hi, Yukari! Is that for Sunday lunch? Bingo! How's Aunty? You know... the same. It's coming! Sure is. I'll go see. Our portable shrine parade is famous for being wild. It thrills me to see it coming. I'm Yukari Hanabusa a high school student. This is my "neighbourhood" in the vast city of Tokyo. It's a small district, but in my opinion the people here are really nice. Step aside! Out of the way! Damn thing in the way! Remove it! The title will be "War Experience". Ask your parents and neighbours about it. Make it at least ten pages. Wow! "War"? Why write about war now? Ten pages is too much. During our vacation as well! Quiet, girls! Summer vacation in your grade is very important. Are you going to learn something... or simply loaf around? What will you do? I know you think it's old news... It's been nearly 50 years since the war ended. But I want you to remember that today's prosperity, the good things you enjoy... was created inspite of suffering the greatest form of hardship: war. This district was completely leveled by American B29s. Understand? Get the facts from your parents and grandparents. Remember... to learn about experiences as they were felt by others... and write how you feel about them now, in your way... I mean, you should try to understand for youself. How you feel about it... personally. You can do it. Try your best. If you need help, I'll make myself available. Rise! Bow! Wait up! "War Experiences"? What awful homework. I'll get sick. My folks don't know the least thing about the war. My grandpa just brags about it... and then blames me for not knowing anything about it. Not only you. - You're not the only one! I'll ask my aunt in the park. "That" aunt? Sure. Let's go. "Fly... fly... fly here fireflies..." Hi, Aunty! Want to eat candy? Like some? Why, is that for me? Aunty, do you remember about the war? Yes, I do. They say this district was destroyed by a US air raid? "Fly... fly... fly fireflies..." She'll never get anywhere. No kidding. Let's shove off. We're going! See you later. Sorry. I'll call you. Bye bye. Uncle! Good afternoon. Hi, Yukari! You're here? You look well, huh? So do you, Uncle. I have to push myself to keep up and look well. It seems like Aunty's getting even worse. Yeah. I try to come and see her often. She seems a bit dazed. She's always looking over there... like that old pole is somehow important to her. They want to get rid of it just because it's in the way. There a bunch of bloody fools! Will they take it down? They'll try. They'll try... but we can't let them. That pole stands witness to the hell experienced here. And if they take it away... Sakiko will lose her will to live. It's the one thing she lives for. Did you come to see me? I sure did. It's time to go home. Ok Yuka-chan... I'll take her home. Give my best to your dad. - Sure. Hi there... I got a watermelon for you. - Oh... lucky me! That half-burned pole in the park... are they really going to take it down? Half-burned pole? Oh, that one... The one Aunty's always staring at. What... you object too, don't you? Can't be helped. It's progress. That reminds me... I have to talk to you about my homework later. What homework? I have to... - We'll talk while we eat the watermelon. What? Aunty's war experiences? Yah... I have to write an essay. About war? That's the assignment. My teacher said... "Write how you feel about it, in your own way." This whole district... was bombed out during the war, no? You must remember what it was like. It was a long time ago. Sakiko's in no condition to talk about such things. You should realize that? Forget about the air raids. But that's why I'm asking you. "Aunty's youth. The half-burned pole..." It sounds really interesting! I said forget it! It's not a subject anyone wants to blab about. Then... who can I ask? You want me to ask that burnt out pole? Yah, do that if you like. You said you don't care if they cut it down. Some contradiction! That thing's no use anyway. People ridicule it. Better it's gone! That's how I feel. He's tired. He was even too busy to eat lunch. What's more, those who suffered in the war... often find it very hard to talk about. Then, will you tell me Mom? Pretty please! I can't. I was too small then. Still... I remember the food shortages after. I could tell you how terrible that was. That's just it. It's worth knowing. That's what we're supposed to write about. Dad clams up and won't talk. How am I going to find out? He's acting so strange today. He has his reasons. He's only human. The vacation started. I belong to the folk-dance club... We meet to keep folk-dance alive. We're dancing in the autumn school festival. We have to practice hard. Chin up! Chin up! This is the last part. Concentrate. Try hard! Don't throw your horse! Horses throw people! Turning into a real clutz! Okay... take a break! "Clutz"? - It fits you. You're mean! How about your essays? I'm getting nowhere. Try hard. I expect good results. Miss Yukari Hanabusa! That would be me. We just got a message... Phone your mother at Central Hospital. Thank you. Hospital? How's Aunty doing? I'm not sure. She's still unconscious. She'll be all right, won't she? She'll get better. She hit her head. But we're hoping she'll pull through. Dad! Sakiko! Are you awake? Sis! - Aunty. Did she try to say something? Dad... what happened to her? Where? By the park. Come out for a minute. The park where she always stays? Yes. At the corner near that pole. It didn't happen because she was in a daze. Somebody who saw it... said a little kid ran into the street. She ran out to stop him and was hit by a car. Like that?! The kid's okay. He wasn't even scratched. But... when it happened... she yelled, "Keiko, watch out!" and ran out. "Keiko"? Did she know the kid? Aunty lost her child... her daughter disappeared in the fires after the air raid. Her name was Keiko, meaning "fireflies". Then... To Aunty, the kid must have appeared to be Keiko. I see. That's why she sits on the bench by the pole... She's waiting... for Keiko to return. Yukari.... in Aunty's mind, the war's still going on. She's not the only one. There are lots like her. You too? You can't even imagine now, what happened back then. It was a very black time. Early summer 1943 Dad... I'm going. Where's Sakiko? Combing her hair. Yuta! Here... your lunch! Thanks, Sis! I've made everything ready for you. Just heat the soup... I'm off. NOW'S THE TIME TO BEAT THE USA AND ENGLAND We make no concessions to America and England. We fight till we win! You have to do the same in 'sumo'. Never give up! Understood? - Yes! Next! Next! Coward! How can you serve your country? Useless fellow! Hey, you... Ever hear this...? "Win by losing." There are other ways to win. Don't give up, okay? Teacher... Don't look so sad. Kind teachers like him are rare these days. And... did you wash his towel? No. You should've washed it before returning it. Is he a new teacher? He only just started. Do you know... that old Kazami clinic near the bridge? He's the owner's son. The Kazami clinic? I wish I were in Mr. Kazami's class! I'm glad you have at least one teacher who encourages you. Try hard, eh. - Sure. "Win by losing..." Teacher Kazami! Looks good. I'll have one, too. Please meet my sis. He's Mr. Kazami. Ahh... the 'win by losing' teacher? Thank you for taking care of my little brother. Not at all. Hot, isn't it? Give me red beans over rice... no... over ice. Teacher, we've been out of red beans for a long time. Oh, I suppose so. KAZAMI CLINIC Do you like reading books? - Yes. What's wrong? Yuta seldom reads. Sis! Welcome. How do you do. My parents... This is Sakiko and Yuta. Please sit. Well, well... please make yourselves at home. Kazuo rarely brings anyone to visit us. Ow! What are you doing, Sis? Say, "Thank you very much." first. That's all right. Eat as much as you want. They're the only kind we can get nowadays. Kazuo... she's a pretty girl, isn't she? He's stubborn, though he might not look like it. He never listens to anything I say. He doesn't want me to be a teacher. Don't argue... not on their first visit here. Quite so. Excuse us. Have one. Shall we race? I'm a fast runner! Sure! Ready! Steady! Go! "The coals are emitting smoke, "Which rises high like a dragon. "The sound of striking steel... "Echoes as loudly as thunder..." It's your Sis! I'll go with her. See ya! Just now I received the greatest honor. Rise! Bow! Be seated! By his imperial order, I shall go to the battlefield. At this critical time... I'm being summoned by His Majesty the Emperor. The greatest honor for a Japanese man. "My life is but 25 years." I shall devote myself to Japan's victory. I know you boys will follow my example. I shall be glad to die for my country... knowing that you will follow me. HOUSE OF HONOUR Yuta. Teacher Kazami! My condolences. I'm here to pray for your brother. Please go in. My condolences. Dad, this is Yuta's teacher... Mr. Kazami. How do you do. Thank you for helping Yuta. Please have some sak√© in my late son's honour. Sakiko, please serve him. -Yes. Thank you. - Please. He died before he could really enjoy life. He was unlucky in life. He'd only just become an adult... Please Sir... please drink up. Sakiko, ask him to drink. - Ah... yes. Please drink up. And so... did Aunt Sakiko and Mr. Kazami the teacher get married? Why not? Before it could happen, Mr. Kazami received his red paper. "Red paper"? His draft notice. He was called up for the army. He should have refused to go. Don't be silly! You couldn't refuse a draft notice? But I wouldn't have gone. He would have been charged for betraying the Japanese people. He'd have been sent to jail... as unpatriotic. "Unpatriotic"? For being anti-Japanese. That's weird! But the way Sis and Mr. Kazami chose was... DRAFT NOTICE Now it's done. How long can I survive? Kazuo... Sakiko, I want you to understand: I'm not afraid to die. But I don't want any part of this stupid war. I don't want to kill anyone... no matter what the reason! I know. I understand But I wonder if I can make it safely to Hokkaido. I hope this war ends... before they arrest me. No! Don't give up that easily! I'll go with you. Please take me with you! I told you I can't do that. You'd become an accomplice. Your folks could be implicated. I can't let that happen. I'm sorry for being selfish. It'll be okay. I believe that. You said this war won't last long. So, please! Stay alive for my sake till after it's all over. Of course. I promise. I'm confident I can endure whatever hardship comes. You sure? Very sure. I'll test you. Stare at each other, making funny faces... If you laugh first, you lose, you lose. Kazuo... I want to go with you. Your love will keep me going. I'll stay alive! Promise. Turn off the light. We're looking for Kazuo Kazami... somebody saw you with him. Where did he go? I don't know. You were... in love with that coward? No... that's not true. You sure? Your family had a war hero... and they run a military shop. So we'll leave you for now. If Kazami contacts you... tell us right away. You'll be punished if you shield him. Understand? TOA MINE, HOKKAIDO Second Section, the blasting's over. Get started! Hey, you two there! You think it's a joke greeting us Japanese respectfully? Don't act big, Korean bastards! Damn scum! Listen... no one cares what happens to you dogs? There are lots of replacements! You dare resist us? Stop! That's enough! Who are you? You're killing them! What? You're Japanese! Where you from? Name? Halt! Stop, or I'll shoot! I'll never die. I'll live. Sakiko... NAME "KEIKO" - BORN JUNE 7, 1944 UNPATRIOTIC! WRETCH! "Patriotic Women's Association" The 'draft-dodger' woman is very young. She even had a baby. What a pity! Unpatriotic at such a critical time. It shames the whole neighbourhood. Damn you! Wait! Wait, midget! Unpatriotic! Wretch! Unpatriotic! What happened? Idiot! You're a fool, Sis! I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. You had a rough time, huh? Well... that's how it was then. Dad... Aunty was only eighteen, huh? Only one year older than I am now... and yet she had already... been in love. It's true... but things were different then. No one knew what would happen tomorrow. And then she lost her baby Keiko as well... - Yes. She disappeared at that telephone pole. It's so sad... such a painful memory. So that's why Auntie... always hangs around that pole, eh? She can't forget Keiko... she can't give up on her. Poor Aunty! With Keiko and our father lost in the air raid... she had to quit school to work and also to take care of me. Then she married Uncle who you know now. Isn't she great? I really respect her. Oh, you're here? Dear... Sakiko's come around. She seems all right now. Good! Nice breeze. I'm so glad you're better, Sis. It's a relief, huh? She's a tough woman. She won't die so easily. It's nice, Aunty. Live long, for someone's sake, too. Someone? Who? Why are you all here? Did something happen? So my aunt was separated from her boyfriend. Then she had a baby. A baby, when she was still in her teens? We'll be eighteen next year. And still no sign of a boyfriend! And her baby was named Keiko, meaning "fireflies". At the climax I bet... many fireflies appeared, didn't they? "Kazuo"! "Sakiko"! Miss Onogi! Gee! How long have you been there? Sounds like a good story. Let me listen too. In my case, I married for no special reason. Your poor husband! Yours essay should be good. Daddy's stories were... Say, "My father" My father's stories were all... so tragic and miserable. This Keiko disappeared, too. Oldsters, women and children fell victim first. You look strong, you might make it. Didn't you say before that Keiko disappeared? That's right. How old was she? Just a baby. That's odd. What is? Yes, it is odd. Your aunt was carrying the baby on her back. Yet she disappeared? Your aunt and your father were saved. Then why wasn't Keiko saved, too? I wonder why... Well?! Dad... your story about Aunty... What... again? About her baby, Keiko... She disappeared, didn't she? Yes. What about it? It's just... you were with them, weren't you? And Aunty was carrying Keiko on her back, wasn't she? So why was it that only Keiko disappeared? She took the baby off of her back by the pole. Took her down? Why? Maybe I shouldn't be asking you this... but do you have bad memories associated with that pole too? Is that why you don't want it there. Leave it alone won't you. I don't want to talk about it! What did you do? I don't know. He just got mad all of a sudden. Let's go. Let's go home. We still have time. All the joints are closed. Your old lady's waiting. Who cares about my old lady? Piss on her! Your husband's back! Thank you. I'm sorry, Missus. It's all my fault. Damn right! You're to blame. Oh! You drank way too much! I'm sure Dad's concealing something. I wonder why he won't tell me. Near this pole during the air raid... something terrible happened... involving Aunt Sakiko... her baby... and my father. Uncle... hello. Hi, Yuka-chan! Thanks for the other day. No, no. How's Aunty doing? Much better... but a bit weak. She was just having a nap. I hope I didn't wake her. No, no... not at all. It's better she doesn't nap too long. Anyway, it's so hot. Thanks! It's really hot! Do you know about the great Tokyo air raid, Uncle? Yes. I heard it was really terrible. Although, I was out of Japan at the time it happened. Is that so? I'm doing research on it just now. I'm amazed! Why? It's homework. I have to write an essay. But finding out about it is really tough! I have books on it. You want to read some? Thanks. Aunty lost sight of her baby during the raid, didn't she? Didn't Aunty tell you about what happened? No... Are you sure? Listen... You know... everyone has a past they don't want to talk about. Even me. I've been married to your aunt for more than 30 years. But we've always tried not to open... old wounds we suffered because of the war. Maybe we're so old... I shouldn't worry about it anymore. Is that so? I didn't realize... I'm sorry Uncle. No, no... you needn't be. Absolutely nothing's... good about war. I don't like it a bit. Quite right. No wars ever again! Ah!... that reminds me. You should see my customer... Hayase, the writer. He runs a club that keeps records of the Tokyo air raid. Really? He's nice and frank. You should talk to him. Want some? Yuko? She's sleeping. - HAYASE - Tokyo Air Raid Memorial Club Sorry to bother you. My wife's a teacher. Just now she's out at a meeting. Let us do it. Don't bother. You're Yukari aren't you? Your aunt's an incredible woman. She's still waiting for her lost child. Well, about today's subject... Yukari-san, your district is here. It got hit the worst of all. Everything was incinerated in that one US air raid. Charred bodies were lying in heaps. It was ghastly beyond your imagination. A million people's homes were burned to the ground. 100,000 victims were murdered in Tokyo in one night. One hundred thousand? Really? I can't believe it. Moreover, most were women and children in home services. "Home services"? What's that? Serving their homeland... in their own homes. What's "homeland"? Hey! I can see why my books don't sell. Their lack of knowledge is my fault. Actually, I didn't experience the war either. How's that? I'm not that old of course. 'Homeland' means cities and towns inside Japan, doesn't it? That's right. May I ask you something? Go ahead. Why did the Americans decide to target this area? I'll show you... If you look at the map... you can see that the area was densely populated. Another major reason was... there were many war effort factories here. But why did they kill mere civilians? It's too horrible! You're right. But the Japanese military killed lots of civilians... during the military campaign in China too. On the evening of March 9th, three hundred B29s... based in the Marianas, flew 2,300 kms. to reach Tokyo. Let's see the film the US forces made documenting that air raid. Slide over a little... so we can see it better. I'm home. - Welcome back. Yukari... have a look on your desk? Your Dad left you something special there. I wonder what... What indeed! A hint: He sat up two nights doing it. Where is he? He got a call to repair a car. "ABOUT MARCH 10th" He wrote it for me! That day was so painful. I'll never forget it I want you to read this so you can understand... for yourself. MARCH 9, 1945 ADVANCE! LIKE A FIRESTORM! Don't cry now. "Fly... fly... fly here fireflies. "The water over there is so very bitter. "The water over here tastes very, very sweet..." "Fly, fly, fly here fireflies!" They evacuated me to Aizu when the bombing started. But they sent me back to Tokyo to finish my last year at school. Yuta... we'll wait to eat supper until after Dad gets home, okay? Is he at work? Yes. He works at a big aircraft factory. Does he make airplanes? - Maybe. Yuta... were there any air raids in Aizu? Some. But not so many. They happen all the time in Tokyo. You'd better go back to Aizu as soon as you can. No! I don't want to. It's so windy today. Yuta, eat lots. Your sister was saving the rice ration for you to get big and strong. I know. But I'm full. Are you? Eat this, Sakiko. It'll keep your milk up. Yu-chan... better sleep while you can... before an air raid comes. Leave your pants on. And for sure... keep your things by your bed... ready to go. Eh, what's wrong? Uncle Yuta's come back home. Smile and say hello. Keiko... here's Uncle Yuta. "Fly... fly... fly here fireflies. "The water over there is so very bitter. "The water over here tastes very, very sweet..." Yuta!... Wake up! It's terrible! Yuta!... Get ready and go downstairs! Dad? He's outside. I have to put Keiko on my back. Help me. The mortuary tablet! Get it! Hurry! Hurry! Air raid! Take shelter! Damn you! You murderers! Yuta!... we have to run! Where's Sakiko? She's coming Hurry! What're you doing? Dad! Leave all that stuff! Where can we go? Where to? Don't worry. Ready?... let's go. Yuta!... - Yuta... Let's go! Hurry! Take shelter! Over here! Where do we go? Wait! A lifeline... Hold on so we don't get separated. Don't let go! Got it? Okay? Let's go! Hold on to it! Don't let go! Get up! Run! Don't let up! Watch out, Sis! Dad!... Dad! Let's go! Hot! Burning! I'm burning! It's hot! Yuta! Yuta help! Yuta... Keiko! How's Keiko? - She's okay. Yuta... climb the pole... Get in that window! Hurry! Yuta hurry! Yuta... take Keiko! Yuta! Take Keiko! Hurry! Take Keiko! Quick! - Keiko... Yuta! Keiko! Hurry take Keiko! Yuta reach down! Keiko! Keiko!!! Next morning what I saw... I'll never forget. It's etched in me and always will be. A YEAR LATER. Keiko and Dad... I'm sure they're alive somewhere. We don't know that they're dead. You think so, too, huh? Keiko's favorite song... I wish she could hear it. "Fly... fly... fly here fireflies. "The water over..." After that... I looked everywhere for them for years. But I never saw Dad or Keiko again. They had simply vanished. If I'd only done as Sakiko had said... at least Keiko might've survived. To this day, I still regret that I didn't. Ah... looks like fun. May I join you? How's this? Hey Yukari... Why not come and join us? Just now... I was reading what you wrote for me. I really appreciate it. The reality was even worse. I feel like... I'm so sorry. It's impossible to write it all... I still can't talk about it. But you know... I still think of that baby all the time. Thank you. So pretty! You've got a kind heart. I'm proud of you. Keiko was an unpatriotic girl's baby. And I was an unpatriotic girl's brother. "Unpatriotic"? Did you think of that... during the air raid? No. I was way too scared for that. But I can't deny, it's always been there in the back of my mind. But... you weren't responsible, were you? At that time everybody suffered so much? Yes. Not only the dead... the survivors perhaps even more. But... I wonder why misfortune kept falling on Aunty. It never stopped. It's true, isn't it... I wish she'd had a long, peaceful life. That's really great! Your sister? No, the fireworks. Here... you should have one? Move a little. It's good for your health. Hi! How's it going? You're looking happy. Heh, Jin-san. You're early, aren't you? Don't mistake me for your man. It's me... it's Yuta. It's time to go. I'll drive you. My trucks over there. Keiko! Keiko! Sis! Sis! After she survived the accident too... Maybe she was just tired of waiting. She waited since before you were born. It was just too long. She won't be singing that 'firefly' song anymore. Maybe now she'll meet Keiko now. Yuta-san, it's time to tell you... Sakiko always relied on you. She said she couldn't have gone on without you there to support her. Did she... say that? I thought... I was a burden on her. Oh, no. You were both orphaned. You helped each other. Thank you. By the way... Yuko-chan... like to see the things Aunty left? What's that? It's a back-strap for carrying a baby. The back-strap... for carrying Keiko on her back? Yes. She kept it so carefully. Amazing... It's burnt... how awful. Who's this? He's the teacher who taught me to "win by losing". Uncle... would you mind if I borrow these? I'll make copies and keep them. Sure. Sakiko'd be happy. No matter what the reasons... war's a terrible thing. I have terrible memories from my time in China. I was made to do cruel and terrible things... to innocent women and kids in that war. The Japanese army left many Sakikos behind them in other countries. Remember to write that in your essay too, no? Sis... phone call! Who is it? Some Hayase guy. - Hayase? Move, would you. Hello? Yuraki speaking. Yes. Ah... Mr. Hayase? Of course, sorry. Yes... Thank you for your help the other day. Yes. That's right. Her name is Keiko. It's written like "fireflies". What? A Korean? Is this Korean person related to Keiko? Well... there's no real proof. But... if what she wrote is correct... the facts that... she was found during the Tokyo air raid... plus her age... the way it coincides with your aunt 's story seems more than coincidence. That's why I'm calling you. I'll have to talk to my father about it. Thanks for telling me. Goodbye. You haven't told your father yet, right? I'll tell him after I hear more from Mr. Hayase. Good. It shouldn't be too late. And... will you do me a favor? I know. I'll go with you. Thank you. Is she really a Japanese woman? It seems... she was found by a Korean family... who took her with them to Korea and raised her there. Her Korean name is I Sun-ik. I Sun... Oh.. her surname is Lee? It's pronounced "ee" in Korea. I'll read it. Well... "My father was taken to Japan as forced labor. "He married a Japanese woman there." It's a Japanese-Korean marriage. Ahh... Korea was a Japanese colony in those days... marriages between Koreans and Japanese were condoned. "Before long they had a child. "But they lost their child in the panic of the American... "fire bombings of March 10th. "It was in looking for him that they found me. I was his age. "I was burned and crying loudly, they said." "I came to know about it only recently. "My father had died. My mother decided to tell me before she died. "I decided to visit the country where I was born... "to honour my real parents. "My husband and daughter agreed to it." As I read this, I remembered your aunt. It's possible this woman is the child she lost back then. It's a real pity, that your aunt is no longer with us. It's about time. Here they come. Excuse me... Mrs. I Sun-ik, right? Are you Mr. Hayase? I'm her daughter, Chun-hee. Thank you so much for helping us. This is my mother. Mother... this is Mr. Hayase. How do you do, Mr. Hayase. Thank you. This is... my first visit... to Japan. But... I'm sorry to say... I... cannot... see anything. My sister waited here for her baby girl... every day since the air raid. But she recently passed away. Just recently? - Yes. Yes. She waited patiently for 46 long years. Is that so? Omoni... It means "mother." She said she was sorry... for the parents of the child they'd found. After the air raid they looked for them. But everything had burned down. They couldn't do a thing. But at least they saved the baby's life. Is there any proof of what happened at that time? I'm sorry... I have nothing like that. Listen... about my aunt... I have her photo with me. Mother... this is it. The one standing here... is Aunt Sakiko. The baby in her arms is... Keiko. Yuko-chan... I brought this. Mrs. Lee... this is what Aunt Sakiko left... The back-strap she used to keep Keiko on her back that day. "Fly... fly... fly here fireflies... "The water over there is so bitter. "The water here tastes very, very sweet." A child's song about fireflies. All the while she waited for her child... Sakiko would sing it. "Fly... fly... fly here fireflies... "The water over there is so bitter. "The water here tastes very, very sweet." Sakiko, can you hear our firefly song? After all, there was no proof to clearly show that they were... mother and daughter. But Mrs. Lee wanted to think of Sakiko as her mother. She was certain of it. And maybe that's how it should be. Six months after Mrs. Lee and her daughter... left for home... Shinichi and I had this plaque made. Mr. Telephone Pole... you're a witness to the fire bombing raid on Tokyo on March 10, 1945. You know the horror of the 100,000 innocent people murdered that night. Mr. Telephone Pole, always proclaim: We must never cease to work for peace... and above all, have the courage to keep it. Insulting dog! What a nice day! Hurry! Watch out for cars. Hurry or we'll be late. I forgot my lunch! What a hopeless sister! Holy crap! What's up? I forgot something. Hopeless brother! Hurry. I'm leaving. You can't blame me, can you? See you later! English subtitles reworked by salmond
