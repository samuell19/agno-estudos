Why are you shouting? Who are you? I am frog. Frog? Yah, frog! Are you not a human? - Have you heard of frog in empty well? - Yes. Have you seen it? No. I am that. Are you cheating me? Shuck! Think that you have been cheated. That's all. Why did you jump in well? Did anyone remove you from whatsapp group? Tell me. I don't want to remain alive. Why do you feel like that? That... He dumped me. I am not angry with him. But...without him... I can't live without him. So it is love failure, isn't it? In present days are there people like you? What should I do? Dear, love is not just an emotion. There is a science behind that. I'll tell you. While we are in love, an hormone will develop in our body. What is the name of that...? Oxytoxin. According to the level of this hormone love will increase and decrease. Now you must be thinking how does a frog know all this. I am not a person as you are thinking. I am something great. Do you know, I am a man of divine power? A person living with the support of God. Not only in this well, but I travel to many places. In the name of divine power, I get food and accommodation in many places. I get to know many big shots there. From them I have gained lot of knowledge. I got this knowledge about oxytoxin from a psychiatrist. What is the connection between that and my jumping in well? It'll be a wonder only if you don't jump. It is not the guy who dumped you who made you do this now. It is the hormone in your body. I don't understand anything. For the time being you hold on there. No use of telling her all this. I'll start from a low level. For girls if there is a love failure, it is enough to jump in a well or find a noose. Have you ever thought of men? I know of a love story. I am connected to it directly and indirectly. In that, there is not one but two love stories. There is still time for dawn. It is good that you hear that. This love story didn't start in a coffee shop or a campus but in a fish market. You made them stink. It happened by mistake. Get some water. Is it fish water to make them stink more? He has become dirty. His goggles are spoilt. You come again. 'Grape Plant : A frog's narration' "Stage... grape plant stage..." "Stage... grape plant stage..." "Stage... grape plant stage..." "Stage... grape plant stage..." "Smart shining moustache is beautiful." "The cheeks are red like ripe grapes." "On seeing a look... on giving a glance..." "Seeing the walk... Seeing the height..." "A trap is being spread with smile." "A tender plant..." "Is it a newly grown tender mango flower?" "He is the hero in the stage." "A suited match for the heroine." "An attractive face. Heart throb of many girls." "Is he the young son-in-law?" "Stage... grape plant stage..." "Stage... grape plant stage..." "An ideal son..." "He arrives on the venue by walk." "He becomes the center of attraction in that." "Girls surround him from all over." "His arrival makes everyone wonder." Excuse me Brother what is the problem there? It is the fight between two women. Who the hell are you to teach me decency! Don't make me tell your history. Take this. - Move away! Take this! Son! - Yes. - Anyway you are stinking of fish. - Is it? You drop her home. Okay. Dear, hop in. He'll drop you. Will you be here daily? - I'll be there daily. - Okay. Get in. - Is it here? - Yeah! Why is it not lifting? Lift it. - Hi! Were you sleeping? - Stop here. - Here? - Yes. Okay. Thanks! It is I who must thank you. - Thanks! - Uh... Why are you thanking me? It is because you sat behind me - that I could hide my dirty shirt. - Oh! By the way...what is your name? Ima. - Ima... - Ima Rajiv. - Ima Rajiv. - Hmm... Is Rajiv your father or the lucky man? - Father. - Thank God! Without asking I'll tell you. Did this also come along? Shuck! Sorry! Now it is cleaned. Take it. It was not required. Honestly my name is Vivek. People fond of me address me as 'Vive'. Oh...then how does people, not fond of you call you? Is it 'Brother'? 'Brother'? Don't call me that. You call me as Vivek. Uhm. In car not only name but number is also there. I know this is a trick. What to do? - Okay then, bye! - Bye! "Mango draped in silk..." One minute! - What? - It is okay. - This is a part of it. - Is it? Then...you'll have to do some work. To tackle her. Oh God! What a person to attract her! I'll deal with that. What a tragedy! It was not needed. I forgot that I am a watchman. You know guys, as far as India is concerned the biggest entertainment, as per the survey it is cricket. After that it is cinema. When television was introduced people said there won't be cinema here after. Now television depends on movies. Same way cinema is also depending on TV. People prefer to see in bigger screens. That is why they pay money... and see advertisements in cinema halls. There are many companies in Kerala alone which were branded in theatre alone. - Can I ask you one thing? - Sure, sir! There are people who don't visit religious places. What do we do by going there? We pray. We pray for whom? For us and for people close to us, right? I must earn money. My children should remain healthy. My wife must get a job. Isn't this what we pray? What if we visit cinema theatre? Don't we pray for a character in a story that we like? Save the hero. Nothing should happen to the heroine. It should be a happy ending. Like that. What I am saying is, prayer is happening in both the places. So, theatre is the only place were we are praying for the others. The most divine selfless peaceful place in the world is... cinema hall. Agree with me? - Yes. - What is he talking? Sir, may I... - Come in. - Thanks, sir! After saying all this, he is drinking water. Where did we stop? - Sir, religious place. - Okay right. Vive! What is the difference between religious place and cinema theatre? Very simple. To get peace of mind we go to the religious place. But it is with peace of mind that we go to the theatre. That is the difference. Yes! Peace of mind. Peace. Where it is there, we can sell anything. The audience which come to the carnival with peace, from the ambiance that we provide get involved in the cinema. With that in the advertisements that we show. It'll get business to the clients. Anyway guys, go and meet your target. - Yes, sir! - All the best! - Okay? - Okay, sir. You go ahead. I have to collect something. What is it? Things are very slow. After the flood no clients are coming up. I know the matter. But I can't tell this to the new staffs. You try to clear the maximum outstanding. I don't have to mention about cash. Clients cheques are going on bouncing. Avoid agency and try to get some direct agency. Give offer in off screen and on screen. Mumbai is not having any flood like Kerala. I have extreme pressure. - You try to do something. - Okay sir. Let the work go on. Just now I mentioned about pressure. Hello, sir! Okay, sir. Deal, sir. Sure, sir. Sure. I'll take care of it. Okay. There is no spicy news in Malayalam. Rent a read. The icon of innovative thoughts. You thief! So you were an intellectual, isn't it? Rent a read. I'll bring her in cinema screen. Okay. Rent a read. Reached final destination. Government need not be blamed. I should have used helmet. It is my fault. Only my fault. Hey, guy! Is it your vehicle? - No. - Move aside. - What is this? - Let me see. How is it? Is it good? - Excellent. - You'll prosper. Got a book on rent. Rent a read... Careful! Give way to this uncle. - There are many readers for this book. - There it is. I'll get some more copies. By the way, I read the article. Congrates! Thank you! You are a scholar, isn't it? Hmm... On which year did this company start? Last year. Why? Nothing. Foot falls are not as expected. This company needs to reach to the people. The reach is not at all good. Necessary reach is there. More than enough. - Don't we need to leave? Meeting. - Please! Give me 5 minutes on rent. Okay, don't exceed 5 minutes. Okay. Ima, meeting! It is only meeting, right? Nothing urgent, isn't it? Please, let me talk! You know, Ima. Size does matter in business. - Shuck! - Like her. You concentrate here. Larger than life size. On seeing in silver screen, people will become a fan. We start making scores. That is the psychology. An ad of Rent and read. If it comes on carnival screen, from next day onwards there will be a queue here. Like in the beverage. Ofcourse! Book is like brandy bottle, isn't it? What is your name? - Shaileja. - But there is no shyness. Allow me to talk. Please! Ima, if our product should reach more people we must reach to the people. Do you understand? My dear! - That I liked. - No, Vive... Call like that. Good usage. I didn't start this by targeting everyone like soap and comb. Main aim was to promote reading. It was not aimed at profit. That's good. People here are looking at whatsapp even during the climax. In between that advertisement. Cheapness, spoiler and bluff! Such an efficient girl I haven't seen in my recent times. Thanks! Ima! If the content is catchy, nobody will look at the phone. Ima please! If you give me 24 hours time, I'll return with an eye catchy campaign. You can select only if you like. Is it needed? It is needed. Please! It'll be very costly, isn't it? You are mistaken. In minimal cost you'll get maximum reach. The advertisement in big screen is that. Anyway, we can negotiate on tariff and all. Okay. Send me a proposal first. All of you have reached at the right time. There is no delay. Did all of you have food? Do you know how to prepare raw banana fry? No, boss! I see. What about you? Let me see. Good. Do one thing. You go to Marine Drive and sell that by standing under a tree. If there is no other alternate, I'll also come to eat. Why are you all going around calling yourself as salesmen? Donkeys! If you sell two products, you bring back four. To store that I have to get another godown. There are many branded water filters in the market. Then who'll buy our useless product? What is wrong with our brand? Nothing wrong. Can't you see what is written in block letters? Which other brand has got syngola 6 technology? - Who is that? - What is syngola 6? Yes. I have told so many times. In an ordinary water purifier the bacteria are killed and the dead bodies are deposited in that itself. That is it. That will enter people's stomach and develop diarrhea. But our water purifier will kill the bacteria and see here, it'll bury them in this cemetery cabin. - Why are you laughing? - Nothing. Is cemetery such a big comedy? What is this? Saying all this you try to sell this to the people. Instead of that don't bring it back to me. We'll do it. I should be blamed to be supporting them. Let us go. Seeing your face it looks like you have buried some syngola 6 in cemetery. Out of depression I am starving. Is it? Today isn't it your turn to prepare food? I'll prepare and you'll eat. - You keep waiting. - I know that. Let us go to the road side shop. Ponni had called. For porridge there is no rice. - What is that? - To buy that and come. Rice. What a tragedy! How many times did you watch 'ThenmavinKombathu'? You start the vehicle. - Okay. - Save Edaprayar! Stop contamination of water! Sigma Gelatin must be shut down! Allow to live! I am dying of hunger. Find some place. You are saved. Go man! If this continues, piles will be announced as national disease. Stop! Where are you going? You don't eat chicken. - Piles... - Stop it! While talking about food you don't talk about wastage. Use 'Hit'. You'll get intermediate relief. - No use of that. - Brother! Things are not good. What happened? There is no benefit from this water business. Life is full of leakage, isn't it? Yes man! There is development only in the matter of age. That is going on increasing. Brother! Two plates of parota... and one animal meat. - What is this? Brother, beef! - Okay. - Isn't beef an animal? My precious! You remain silent. All these ideas when we are hungry. We can only order thinking as beef. How do we know whether it is dog, cat or bull? On saying as animal meat, all this will be covered. On ordering we can eat peacefully. I became greedy. Oh... We don't think we can eat meat... and parota for too long in this Eranakulam city. Should we take parcel for our friends? No need! Their motive to prepare porridge by themselves will get spoilt. Then let us continue with our motivation. Anicha! - What? - You eat first. - Are you not eating? - First you eat. Are you testing? Should I pray? Oh God! What is your opinion about women going to Sabarimalai? First let a girl enter in my life. - You wait and see. - Then I'll think about it. All the girls are dumping me. "In Marine Drive under the tree love is blossoming..." Let this remain here. Don't put the brief to dry here. Put it upstairs. Why? Isn't my brief a decent one? A fan is rotating here. I am also sharing the electricity bill for that. This will remain only here. Who has left this door open? They must be the ones. Who else? Why is the association secretary so irritated about the bachelors? I don't know. Tell him that Abdul Kalam sir was a bachelor. Don't these idiots know that? Bacteria has arrived. Bacteria is your original father. Not the one in the certificate. Dear, have you prepared porridge? What? Today is your turn, isn't it? If you don't want to starve, go and prepare it. Give way. Even Dubai is not so hot. - Right! - Oh God! - Secrecy! - That is good. It looks like inside the stomach an evacuation problem is going on. - Is it? - I think that animal meat has worked. The curse of all the animals is inside your stomach. - That is it. - It is a big curse. I'll be back soon. Don't forget to flush. It is your usual act. You know about my business. I am very particular about water saving. What is your condition there? I am okay here. What okay? You are wondering around there. Father, please! Trust me. Do what you want. I want you to succeed. - What about mother? - That was over. I have left office only now. I'll call after reaching home. No need. I'll call. - Fine. - Okay. - Was that father? - I am safe for one week. Right. Seeing your expression I understood that. - Is it? - You can either leave or not. I need not stay here. Why don't you send me to Dubai by getting a visa for me? Hey, I need charger. Charger? Do you know what is the biggest shortage in Kerala? Shortage of charger. Anicha! Shall we give application to the Chief Minister? You go and give. This is the problem. I must not tell. You knock the door and then open. You can't be sure in what condition we'll be inside. - Take it. - Go away man Who is this party? My new client. My new girlfriend. New girlfriend? You never had any old girl friend. She is good. What is her name? Ima. Ima Rajiv. Ima is okay. See to it that she is not dumb. Go man! Enough! No need to pinch too much. Get me also an appointment. In your care off I'll deliver my singola there. Should you deliver your singola there? Then her books will fall in that and become wet. Go man! Don't do any help. No. Here after I won't help you in life. Ima...Ima Rajiv. Be careful! How is it? Interesting. I like it. Thank you! Tell me. In total after seeing how much percent like will I get? 75%. Above that if 25% more is added? Like will become love. I mean...on seeing the final out you'll love that. Oh...let's see. Shall we proceed? Sure. Let me know when it is ready. It is ready. This is a special case for me. - Is it? - Yeah. Thank you! Don't you go to market anymore? After that incident wherever I see fish, I think about you. - Wherever I see fight, I think about you. - Is it? Thank you! Good match! Excuse me! - Is Lumbar Grass's dog year there? - How does he know all this? - Oh no! - Ima! Malayalam translation of that is there. 'Dog's years'. Is that enough? I am not much comfortable in Malayalam. Why? Don't you know the alphabets? May I know your good name? Sorry! I have a very bad name. Is it? Very good. Keep it up. Idiot! Good girl, but her name is tarnished. Else it would have been interesting. - What is this? - Sorry! Anicha! Come...come. Don't you want to talk business? - Coming. - Come. I am always ready. Poor guy! Give him 5 minutes. He is my roommate. You people are very fond of this 5 minutes. Isn't it, Ani uncle? Not Ani uncle. Anichan. People fond of him does call like that. Some bloody beggars say so out of jealousy. Don't take it seriously. Enough. Come to business. - Let us come to the matter. - Yeah! - That is... - Hey! Sorry! I made a mistake. - That is... - Wait. - This is our brochure. - Oh. I need not explain the matter to you. Like that I don't have to explain about our product to anyone. Even then I am saying, ours is the No. 1 water purifier in India. Aquastil Now with Syngola 6 technology. Oh...there is no problem with the water here. There won't be any problem on seeing. I'll show you something. Bad girl! Get me two glasses of water. Is the water also bad here like the name? Go and get it. What is this? She is not active. Anicha, will you incur shock? This is not as we think. We must be careful. We must perform carefully. Here, see. It is enough if there is reaction in water. No need for anything more. See, look at the water. There are rare chemicals and bacteria. What is the matter? It is because there is no knowledge about syngola 6 technology. If it is our purifier, all this will be buried in a cemetery cabin. Will there be rituals after the burial? Oh God! There are locks in your dress. You lock your mouth with one from that. I am explaining a matter. Whatever it is, we don't want this now. - That... - Don't waste your time here. Correct. - Okay? - Yes. It is better not to die of typhoid. It is good to buy one. No use of buying after getting diarrhea. Let us go. What are you watching? Are you not coming? - Let us go. Ima, I'll be back. - Bye! - No need to give hand. - Shaileja, move aside. No use of staying in the middle of books. You should have sense. Come let us go. She knows nothing about purifying. She must study chemistry. - Come. - Hey! She is not right. She is arrogant. - Don't have any dealings with her. - Is it? - I don't like her. - She is not meant for cheap guys like you. Okay? You shake hands with her carefully. It is the time of 'Me too'. For just touching the hand you may have to hold her feet during bad time. Will you feel bad if I tell you one thing? - What is it? - What a tragedy! If you call me to this dirty place again... Come on. - Hop in. - That is what I am also saying. I must be blamed. This not enough to blame you for this alone. I should be beaten for bringing you here. Start the vehicle. - Stop! Stop! - What is it? - What are you doing? - Stop there. - Stop! - It is not me. Donkey, stop! How are you connected with him? I am his roommate. What is the problem? Roommate? Then it is enough if I catch you. He cheated me by talking about syngola... and delivered a water filter at home. It had leakage and the house got filled with water like MullaPeriyar dam. I abused him and he took it back. On asking for money he keeps cheating me by saying as tomorrow. Tell him that I'll put an end to his tomorrow. You don't worry. I'll get the thing from him. What if you are also a fraud like him? Can't you see that I am not like that? Many say like that. But I am not like that. In a peculiar circumstance I had to keep him with me. That's all. How... did you know that he is in this area? I was searching for another thing. There is 'Rent and read' library here. Do you know? Do you want to go there? - Yes. - I know the place. I'll drop you there. That will be an inconvenience for you. No problem. You hop in. Then it is okay. Ima, one minute. - What is it? - Sir. Haven't you left? I left. But I returned. This is Menon sir. Profitable case. Menon sir is special. He is ultimate intellectual. Full time book reading. He needs book while going to bathroom also. I'll introduce him to you. Sir, this is Ima. She is the all in all here. - Nice to meet you. - Thank you! I read your article in the newspaper. Girls should be like this. - Smart girl! - Thank you sir! In actual I feel a great respect for you. His arrival is not a waste. Thinking about the idiots who doesn't have the habit of reading I feel very sad. Yes, that is correct. - Do you have reading habit? - Ofcourse! What a question is that? Instead of facebook have you read any other book? Tell me. Cursing your dad? Suddenly if you ask how can I say? Who is your favorite writer? Is it the waiter in the bar? What kind of question is this? - Not that. - Then? Shivashanker Pillai. - Who? - Shivashanker Pillai. Is your mind filled with rope? A bit. I need a membership now itself. I'll tell madam. What is the formality for that? - You come. I'll tell you. - Yes. God of politics. Have you not left? No. I thought I'll inform and go. - Then you tell. - Shall I? - You tell. - I'll go and return. Will this old man be a nuisance? He is maximum fond of rope. You must be careful with the guy wandering around with noose. Is it good? Is there only this nod? Any comments? I don't know what I should tell. I am running short of words. Right. It is only when they abuse men that women have no shortage for words. Otherwise there is lot of shortage, isn't it? Go man! She is sure to take me with her. You are a different type off a person. That I had felt long back. You are bound to feel. To think and live like all others. it is possible for anyone. Yes, including you. You made fun of me, right? Yeah! I was serious. You are really different. I became your fan long back. You know how to flatter very well. I mean it. But this is the first time a person is accepting it. I also want to become different. What should I do? If you read well, you'll get knowledge and sense. In the past I used to read well. - Is it? - If I am right, last time I read 'Love on the way'. Great! My Vive! There are many types of reading. Have you heard what Kunjunni sir has said? Reading will cultivate. If you don't read, you'll bend. It is said just like that. In the past for many days I didn't read. Even then nobody got attracted to me. I swear! Then okay. I'll leave. - Did I make you hate? - Yes. - Then okay. - Fine. I'll get her. - Vive! - Yes, sir. - The sales is on Friday in Mumbai. - Okay. This time you must go. You are sending me because you can't take the abuse any more. Rest I must hear, isn't it? - I heard your mind voice. - No, sir. Not that. I am saying this for you to get a boost. Yeah...yeah! You go and celebrate. Have two pegs. You go around and come back fresh. Yeah! I can learn atleast two abusive words in Marathi, isn't it? Hey! Thaleserry property's two hard copies are there in the station. Okay. On the way you collect it. - Hand over it to Mayur in the office. - Okay, sir. - I'll call and inform. - Okay. Excuse me, sir. It is the client. - Carry on. - Thank you! - Hello! - Hi! You can come and collect that cheque. Our first ever financial day. Take it. - Will it bounce? - No. Thank you! The signature is excellent. Yeah! It looks like a lorry has had an accident. Joke! How is your advertisement business going on? Not bad. Very good improvement. In the matter of the cash that is due. Somewhere here a love wholesale is going on. Let everybody love. How are you bothered? Isn't this useless into any love? Are you not ashamed to call me like tha? To feel ashamed is 'Useless' a bad name? Shall I tell a truth? Nobody has loved me till now. In that matter you can trust me. I am a virgin. I'll believe you. How am I bothered if you are into love? Not that... What about you? To me? - Love? - Uhm... No way! I like to live freely like this without any commitments and control. I also like to live without any commitments and control. - But... - But? On seeing some girls, I lose my control. What to do? "Seeing a flower bud passing by..." "There are some dreams in my heart." "In the song that can be heard in the air..." "Two parrots are coming together in a nest." "Let us do some sweet talks and laugh together." "Slowly petal will bloom." "Is it a rose flower?" "This love will develop in us." "Regularly it can be heard." "Are they the spring music?" "Unknowingly your love will melt." "Closely in the soul..." "Thousands of sweet wishes will rise." "It is such a pleasure!" "Sweet words will flow." "It'll spread happiness." "Two souls are bringing together desirable music." "Slowly petal will bloom." "Is it a rose flower?" "This love will develop in us." "Emotions will get soaked in the eyes." "Sweet talk will sprinkle as smile." "We'll wander on the same path." "Each and every word will be heard with attention." "Each minutes will pass by in this stage." "We'll get united on a spot in the heart." "On the path where flowers bloom, we'll fly as butterflies." "The heart will search for eternal love." "Slowly petal will bloom." "Is it a rose flower?" "This love will develop in us." "Every day a new feeling will rise in us." "That love will grow by itself." "Each and every moment will be cherished." "It'll awake memories in you." "Sunrise will spread unique golden rays all over." "Sunset will give way to rainbow." "Let us enjoy this phase and flow as a song." "The heart will be filled with that song." "Slowly petal will bloom." "Is it a rose flower?" "This love will develop in us." "Regularly it can be heard." "Are they the spring music?" "Unknowingly your love will melt." You hug me and sit. Fat hopes Now you get down. What is the work in Mumbai? - Other than boozing. - That? It is a problem job given to me by my boss. You are a big problem by yourself. How can he get you into trouble? Try to make some growth on the way. Let me tell you one thing. I don't like the girls who give me advice. - Tea...tea... - Let us sit here. Tea! If I ask you a serious thing, will you take it as a joke? We Malayilis find comedy even in tragedy. That... If you plan to propose, no need. How smart! How did you know that I planned to propose? I also eat the same rice that you eat. From where does this rocking counter come? It is only this much to see. But you can talk a lot. Girls who can talk cutely like this has got a name in our native. - Shall I tell you? - If it is something bad, no need. It is not bad. It is very good. - Shall I tell? - Okay you tell. Naughty girl! You beggar! I'll kill you. What a tragedy! Don't make me say anything more. Okay. Allow me to tell. No need to tell anything. Call me. - Will you phone me? - Yeah! What is this? Cholera time love! You said you wanted to be different and you are bored. You can read when you are bored. Let me see. Finally will this cholera make a hit? You read it. Sir. - Does Harish have moustache? - Harish's moustache? Let it remain in his face. Else tell him to shave it off. You are a book reader. Take it. Bro, no use. Don't try to provoke. This is online library. What is there if it is offline? We'll make it online. Okay? From where has he landed? - Call me. - Okay. - I'll phone you. Bye. - Bye! Mobile! Vive's excellent catch! Your mobile... - Yes. - Okay. - Have you booked vehicle? - It'll reach the station. Client will surely send. Let us go and see. We must never help a Malayali. Look at her. Arrogant! Is she sitting here? Bro, move a bit. Actually I expected a thanks. What is the cost of the mobile which I caught before it fell? Why is she silent? Will you vomit at night? What happened? - I just asked. - No problem. Excuse me! To where are you going? She is not a mingling type. This book is the only companion. Shuck! What a boring! Shuck! My dear, what kind of a book have you given me? Is it 'Cholera time love'? Why couldn't you have given 'Cold night'? Else you could have given 'Wingless dreams'. It is bad that you thought of me as of your standard. Hello! She has disconnected. On saying anything, she'll disconnect. Cholera is also gone. Now I have only this Sukra sir's book. They have fitted this thing for the passengers to charge their mobile. None of them are working. These holes are made for the insects to build nest. - What do you say? - Yes. Will he be her father? Excuse me! Don't mistake me for asking this. Any problem? I think she is the latest version of arrogance. TTR is here. How much is the cost? - It is confirmed. - Is it so? Tell him to recharge my phone. I'll call and see. Where is she going? I didn't ask her anything now, right? Bro, one second! Shall I sit there? What is she telling him by going there? Oh God! Oh God! Move. Tea...tea... Tea... Bro, tea! - Tea. - No need. It must be a bad tea. This guy is not proper. There is a small mistake. - Oh God! - Oh no! I didn't do anything. I am innocent. From the time he arrived he started. He is trying to grab the girl. Nerve patient! He should be handed over to the police. It is not my mistake. Oh God! I didn't do anything. My dear! I am not an eve teaser. I am an innocent guy. I am going to Mumbai for a meeting. You devil! Why are you beating me? Oh God! Don't catch it in camera. I have to go for the meeting. Oh God! I am innocent! Oh no, it's not me! A lie that I told you about me, will come to light now. - Why are you resisting like this? - Sir.. Come with me. I feel afraid. Please sir! Please! Go inside. - Sir, please! - Oh... Sir, please! We'll find a solution for your hunger. Sir, look at me as your brother. Then do you want me to stink? I have got a meeting. Once sir arrives, we'll attend all the meeting. Is it by assaulting? Please, sir! Sir! Welcome! Come. Sit there. Sit. Is it molesting? What? What? Did you try to quench the thirst of a common Malayali's creation? Why did you do this unwanted thing? Now there will be case, prison, news and there will be night discussion. Your life is gone. I haven't molested anyone. Then what is the problem? You relax. They are not believing what I am saying. Do you believe in law? Believe in law. Who are you? I have dealings with God. My recordicall name is 'Hundi lover'. Now and then I'll loot the hundi in temples and churches. In that matter I am a man who believes in all religions. From that money I give some to vegetable vendors, tea shop owners and fish sellers. Rest I give in beverages and support our government. Like in the past, there is not much money in the hundis Some people preach this and that and change the mind of the devotees. So, you are a thief, isn't it? Some people do call like that. What a fate! There are people here to invest in millions and produce cinema about 'KayamkulamKochunni'. Nobody wants our bio pic. Society is biased. In this condition also you are able to smile. That is a positive sign. If you talk about your life filled with incidents, there won't be any particular use. But I'll hear. Just for a mercury. Just like that. Is it going to start from an ordinary family in an hill station? - Sir, I am astrologer Manipayari. - Aah! It must be because he is educated. You sit. What happened? Tell me. What is this? She is not saying anything. No use if you remain silent. Railway police completed with their procedure. Now it is our job. A police station has got its own formalities. You ask her in detail. This is not a place to fun. It is police station. You tell quickly. We have to file an FIR. We didn't tell you to cry. We told you to tell. Say something. Can't you talk? - Can you hear? - Hmm. Did he molest you? Then what happened? How can we know in detail? - Hey, you find a solution. - Sir. Otherwise also there is no value to the words of men. Correct. Why do men alone are able to cry? It is due to unemployment. Do you have anyone to get you out in bail? This is that. We realize that only we are there for our self during bad times. In the past there was a professor with me in prison who told a thing. When you are in trouble people treat you as trouble. Yeah! Let me see if I can do anything. Hold me. I have to get up. Brother, ask him. Sir! Sir! - What is it? - Please come here What happened in the matter of this boy? You listen to what he has to say. That girl is dumb. We are unable to understand what she is saying. Dumb? Oh God! It is gone. Now what will you do? Let someone who knows sign language come. Then we'll see. There is a person. Someone known. Shall I call? - Hi! - Bye Banerjee has arrived. He is the one I told you about. He is great. Including sign language, he knows 6 languages. Gold smuggling is his main business. In leisure time he goes to prison. Bannerjee... is he a Bengali? No, Malayali. His father was crazy about football. Isn't our P.K.Banerjee there? A fan of his. That is why he named him with that name. It'll be okay, isn't it? Ofcourse, it'll be fine now. Aah. The issue is that she is dumb. - Else I would have got saved. - You remain silent. Sir, she is saying that he didn't do anything. The passengers intervened and spoilt the matter. She couldn't tell the truth. This is a real problem. - Hey, release that boy. - Sir. My work is over, isn't it? Shall I leave? You come. - Is it to beat? - Come. Come on Don't be afraid. You come here. No need to lock. Where will I go? No, I'll lock and give the key to you. Leave it. Have you ever thought about we policemen? By remaining awake and staying away from relatives we are running around to maintain peace in the country. We also make some mistakes. We are also humans. - You are going to Mumbai, isn't it? - Yeah. You drop her also in railway station. You are going to mangalapuram, isn't it? You go to the railway station with him. Are you happy? You go. For a stranger like me you did so much. I'll never forget this. This is nothing. I'll also never forget. For thieves like us, to remember only some moments like this are there. You are something special. I'll never forget. All the best! I forgot to ask you one thing. What is your real name? For people who don't have anyone to remember, what is the need for a name? You can call as anything. Call as Ramakrishnan. That is my father's name. What is that? 'I couldn't do anything in train' 'At that time. Sorry!' After getting me all the beating are you saying sorry? What is your name? 'Deepika!' Deepika. You have put off the light in my life. You sinner! 'Please don't be angry on me, please' I am not angry. I have got only gratitude towards you. I could see the interior of the lock up due to you. I came to know all the matters. I saw. Congrats! Ima, what happened was... No need. You need not say anything. I know what you are going to say. For the time being I have no mood to talk to you. Bye! Hello! Hello! That is also gone. Don't look at me like this. Hey, are you hungry? Come. Have you seen him? He should be beaten like this. If only I had got him in my hand, I would have killed this dog. He is just an idiot to have tried to molest a girl in front of the people. People reacted correctly. I'll be back soon. This is 'Twenty four'. 'The daughter of Mr. Srikanth,' 'the MD of the Sigma company, which is in Edaprayar was kidnapped.' 'The kidnappers were arrested by the police after a confrontation.' 'The activist party leader AnbuShabeer, who planned this kidnap...' 'Was shot and dead during the incident.' 'Police informed that the girl,' 'Was handed over to the parents safely.' 'Activists testified that the kidnap happened..' '..as all their alternative measures failed' 'The activists who were caught confronted.' 'Anwar Jamal devoted his life for the fight against' 'the Sigma company in Edaprayar.' 'His death has shocked the whole of Kerala.' Mobile! I am happy! Rice, kerosene, sugar. I have lost my job. I need not go to Mumbai. Her sign language. You beat me on my chest by folding that hand. That will be better. Where will I go now, my God! I can't return to my native. There I am a viral hero due to you. Everybody kicked and stamped me on online. No use of returning to the native. I am not left with any job. What work do you have in Mangalore? Why are you crying, Deepika? You write and show something. Tomorrow is the marriage. Then why are you here? Oh God! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Please stop the bus. Stop the vehicle! Get in. Let us go. Hello! Are you eloping? Are you thinking how I know? In the past I have also eloped like this. 'I got into the bus, on the way to railway station' 'Don't be tensed. You come.' 'Where have you reached?' 'I'll be in Kottayam. Don't be afraid.' No use of remaining like this. Let us see what we can do. What is there to do? What were you doing here? I told you to take care hundred times. If she doesn't want any of us, let her go. By cheating everyone she has left with a useless guy. Till where will she go? Till now she hasn't opened the door. Anju! Anju! What is it? Open the door. No use of your remaining behind locked door. I won't open. You want to beat me, isn't it? We won't do anything. You open the door. Don't I know uncle? Dear, this is not a small matter. The matter is not as you are thinking. Will you open or should I break it? She left with the man of her choice. What is the use of breaking this door? Anju dear, open the door! Why are you also not trying to understand her feelings? No use of beating me. She has gone to live with the man of her choice. Tell us where she has gone. Why are you pleading to her? I'll make her talk. To Mangalapuram. Are you telling the truth? Yeah! How did they go? - That I don't know. - Is it by train? You didn't show this eagerness in understanding her mind. Hey! From the time that she has left, it is more probable that she has gone by train. In Mangalapuram Raghu and friends are there. I'll call and tell them. He'll bring her back from the railway station. - The auspicious time might pass away. - That is okay. Where did he go? I think he has cheated you. He must have thought that it'll be a loss to marry you. Whatever it is, he could have called you. The phone is switched off. Where to go and search for him? Hello! Deepika, where have you reached? Give the phone to Mahesh. It is to tell him an important matter. Give it to him. Give it to me. Who is this? Hello! Mahesh, don't go to Mangalapuram. They have arranged men to catch you there. You get down somewhere else. Hello! Stop! I am not Mahesh. I am Vive. Vive? Where did he go? How do I know? What will I do? What will I do now? Please, you be with her. There is nobody else. She is a dumb girl. Protect her till Mahesh comes. Please! Who is that? My God! Hey, what are you going to do now? 'I will wait until Mahesh calls' What if he doesn't come? 'I will die' Suicide? If you commit suicide, I'll get trapped. People will make out that you committed suicide... by getting dejected due to molestation. I'll go to prison again. I won't allow you to die. You need not die like that. 'I have no other way apart from that' What happened to my daughter? - Crane has come for us. Get in. - I am getting scared So much crowd! Go to that side. Like that. Careful! This is her first time. careful! No problem. Sir, let us go. - Let me talk to the people. - Come this way. Many will tell not to put money in hundi. Not only coins. - But also notes. - Stop talking. People like me also have to survive. Sir, don't file a case. The girl made a mistake. They are naive. Following the new law why to file a case? Drop it. For the time being I am not doing anything. Tell them to take care of that girl. Such people may repeat this. Thanks a lot! Okay, sir. Will I also get the consideration that you gave the girl? - Start the vehicle. Come, let us celebrate. It is a long time since we came together. No need for any celebration. I have health issues. Do you have any palpitation? Forget that. Is there any snacks? Two copies of this. Was the thief, who jumped inside the well brought to this station? Just now he was taken to produce in the court. Let this remain here. I'll come back and take it. This new handcuff has no look. It looks like the bangle in the hands of the Sardarji. There should be a look when others see. The old one had star value. This is not gaining attention. So sad! Why is it like this now? Technology updation is needed here also. It is the time of artificial intelligence. - The old one had power. - Right. Where is the vehicle? The bus is here. Stop! Who is this? Have you reached here also? This is my girlfriend. My companion in the well. You come. Let us go. I am a guest of the state. I don't have to buy ticket. What is the news? Is the welcome of the residential association over? Anyway, where are you going? Is it to the suicide point? I came to meet you. Is it? Is it your first visit to the court? Do you know? Only the peons know correctly about the court procedures. Let us come to the point. Tell me. What is the matter? What is the motive behind coming to meet me? - What happened to that girl? - Which girl? The other girl, Deepika? Did you come to hear the story? Curious girl! Please tell me! Where did we stop? - In the railway station they both... - Yeah! Again the story continues. At mid night in the premises of a railway station. Deepika, this suicide is not a solution for anything. In life there will be any difficult times. To cross that we'll get a solution also. Our brilliance lies in understanding and finding that solution. That is, Vivek's brilliance. Take this. 'Will you help me find Mahes?' I got kicked very badly. We'll find it. I'll stand by you. But you don't commit suicide. Okay? You drink coffee. Be positive. You learn from me. I lost my job and honor. I lost the girl whom I had attracted. Still I am positive. Yeah! Are you hungry? I feel so hungry. That parota which I ate was not enough. Which is your favorite food? Do you have potato fry? No. I don't sell any unhealthy food here. 'Rice and fish curry' Is it rice and fish? Same thing. Rice and small prawns are my favorite. Deepika, if you commit suicide, you won't be able to eat this. If you won't feel bad, shall I ask you one thing? Accepting this handicap of yours Mahesh is in love with you. Why is your family opposing that? 'Mahesh is from lower caste' Which caste? 'The caste of love' That is not lower. It is upper. 'I know it but my family doesn't know.' Yes, bloody people! They will conduct marriage seeing caste and wealth. There is no value for two people's love. Deepika...Yes! I forgot the name. - Mahesh. -V.Mahesh. Hi! Anju told me everything. Don't worry. I didn't introduce myself. This is my wife Neelima. Anju's friend. Now my wife. She is pregnant. I am Dr. Gautam. MBBS. Living in China. Did he jump the great wall and go? I can understand the meaning of this smile. Why do you tell about this China everywhere? Truth is like a pregnancy. It can't be hidden. Isn't it? - Was the journey comfortable? It was very comfortable. We can talk in detail after reaching home. Neeli, come on! Bro, one minute! No need to say anything. I can understand the situation. I am there with you. Anyway, congrats! - Thank you! - Smart! I like those who show adventure in love. We had a love marriage. Is it? - We didn't get a chance to elope. Before that our family gave its consent. Come. Have you come to Kozhikodu before this? Yes, I have come. Isn't it a super place? - Yeah! Good culture. Excellent food. Loving people! If someone from outside comes here, people will shower love on them. That is true. Have you been staying in Bangalore from a long time? Yes. Are you not in IT field? - Yeah! We are from the same field. I am working in Oracle platform. What about you? Hey! I am talking to you. - Java. - Java? Java is very simple, isn't it? Yeah! Mahesh, its a day man! Congrats! Guys, I don't want you to be workaholic. On working hard, there will be achievements. Mahesh has proved that. That is why we could come together in such an occasion. Everybody will get opportunities. Use it. Now you can celebrate. Yes! Boss. Thank you! Okay. The marriage is on the 10th. Don't forget. How can I remain without coming? I'll come for sure. If you don't come, you'll know. Hey, keep that scale inside. He is playing! - His scale! - Bro, when will you be coming again? We'll meet. Okay? Kannada beauties of Mangalapuramwill have sleepless nights from here on. I am flattered. - Okay. - Run along. All the best! - Okay. Bro... - I don't think I'll be able to go to the marriage on the 10th. Then? It'll be bad if we don't go. Then? We'll meet. The function is on the 10th. Don't forget. Hello! I didn't propose to you seeing your father's wealth or due to the sympathy that you are dumb. I proposed to you because I really love you. If you want, you can love me. Welcome to my mansion! I hope it is a mansion and not a jail. Come on. First you take bath and become fresh. After that we'll have dinner. Rest later on. Come on. AC. Romantic fragrance. Soft bed! You enjoy it man! From where did your Anju find this crazy man? Look at me. I am going to tell I am not your heart throb. 'You said you will stand by me' Your Mahesh will arrive now! You wait. What a trap is this! Oh God! Go and have bath. Go. Go. My God! You rascal! You are trapped, isn't it? I came to know only now. Hey! You meet Ima and try to explain the matters to her. She is in real anger. This was in the middle of her falling for me. She is not Ima, but devil. I don't think it'll work. Do you have any idea about that fraud lover? I think he has cheated that poor girl. Cheating in some place. Sacrifice in some place. That is what life is. You get lost! No use of getting angry with me. I used to warn when you used to get into these problems. - Did you call me? - Hello! Hello! She is... taking bath. Oh God! What is it? What kind of a man are you? You must take bath together. Shuck! You need some classes regarding this family life. I'll solve it. - Gautam! - Yes. Wait. Oh god! After taking bath you look glamorous. It is for your sake. In a single day I became famous. From today onwards you both are entering into family life. First of all, congrats! Thank you! Thank you! Don't be over. One thank you is enough. One I told on her behalf. Is it? See, when two different hands unite with love, you'll get the symbol of heart. Am I right? Everybody knows that. Now, with the increase in love and understanding when you come close to each other, how will the heart change? Look. - Diamond. - Diamond! That is, love will become the most precious diamond. Got it? I respect you. It is for the first time, Gautam is appreciated. Eight missed calls? What is it? Your librarian is a big show off. I phoned her to compromise the matters. She called me as bastard. You can laugh. Even my father hasn't addressed me like that. Is it? That is because he doesn't know English. You fool! Don't have any connection with that girl. If you are a man, you must react. What reaction? You send me a tick-tok with that other girl. I'll forward it to that show off. Anicha! Can you hear what I am saying? Is there any shortage of range there? I can hear properly. Is it? Then you hear properly. You scoundrel! You take this. I have trouble in serving. You eat yourself. I told you. No need for any formalities between us. Gautam, please! Let them eat. Okay, Neeli! Okay. Is this doctor like this from the past? With motivation and advice. He got it from China. Are you not eating? Serve liver fry to Mahesh. Let the liver transplantation of love take place. Doctor, I don't eat liver. - Don't you eat? - No. Then you eat pomegranate. It won't be good to look at. But it is rich in nutrition. "Like a newly grown mango leaf..." "You caressed me psychologically." "Due to shyness both the cheeks..." "...developed dimples silently." Old poetries are a real pleasure! Music, rhyme. Love is flowing in that. - Why are you giggling? - Nothing. Love is flowing. That you told to flatter her, isn't it? He is not a right guy. Menon sir, shall I ask you one thing? Did you have a love marriage? I did love and marry. But I didn't marry the girl I loved. What happened? Dear, we must fall in love. But never marry the person we love. If you marry that person, the love will end there. Do you understand? "It is a pleasure when we don't own it." "What is the use if you are owned?" That is what love is. Right. That is a correct point. It is a long time since you started to score points here. Go and do your job. Pass me that book. I'll take this. I have to go to Kozhikodu. My daughter is living there. - When will you be back? I'll stay there for 6 days. She keeps complaining that I don't visit her. So I have to rectify that. The price of the books that I am taking to Kozhikodu, I think I'll have to pay. A fellow took it from me. Till now he hasn't returned it. It is not price. It is rent. It'll be more than its price. The rent! You thief! "I am eager to embrace you..." Perfect shock absorber. Is this enough? - More than enough. You naughty! In the middle of this eloping, you must have forgotten to get some essential things. Don't worry man! I'll manage it. Okay? - Shuck! What 'shuck'? Take this. It is enough to have babies after two years of marriage. Some idiots will say proudly. The very next day their wife will become pregnant. That is the time. Use it. - Oh God! - Please do it! Doctor! - This won't work. - What man? Deepika, take this. Go. You smile...smile... You are going to the bedroom, isn't it? Not to the death house, right? You smile and go. You go. Seeing her tension we'll think someone unwanted has married her. Take this. Drink. Increase your vitamin. Let it increase. Aah. This first night set up is good, isn't it? What to do to pass the time? There is lot of commotion. Give him a kick, dear! What a dialogue! From two days Menon sir is enquiring about you. What for? Why don't you return that book? Gopika is saying that it was brought from some library. Ancestors have said, woman and book must never be exchanged. Both will never come back. He doesn't know that. - What a man! - Excuse me! What is it? Do you want any tips? Nothing. - Then? Can you give me the key of that bike? Where are you going? To go for a ride. - Now? - Yeah! - Bike is in the poach. Take it. - Thanks! Thank God! He is a fool! On the day of getting a girl in hand, he is going to roam around. Is she also going? Will their first night be on road? Street night! In between the first night in Mangalapuram, you are a girl who should have taken a commercial break. You are standing here taking the support of a boat. How did you get the courage to elope? Hello! What is it? What? It is quite some time since you both started to romance. Is it? Is there any time limit for romancing? Why don't you go home? What is your problem? - Do you want to know? - Yeah! Are you doing sweet talk at this mid night? Who are you? Hello! Hello! You talk to me. Who are you? Should I gather people? You leave the place. Are you from puritan ethic police? Who gave you this job? I am asking to know. Don't you know about the Supreme Court judgment? Anybody who prefer can sit wherever they want without being a nuisance to others. You leave. Go, go. If they see two people in love, they'll come and kill. If they see them fighting, they'll take the video of it happily and share it. How will this country develop? Am I right? 'You are a nice guy' Now only you'll say that I am nice. For the others, now I am a minus. Now this mobile is not a solution for you. No use of waiting for him. You think in a practical manner. I'll give you some options. Plan A. You must return back home. There will be some commotion, disgrace and fight. It'll be okay after some time. Plan B. With one of your friends you try to live in some other city. You can get a good job, isn't it? Do you know anyone like that in Bangalore or Mangalore? Now Plan C. For the time being I can't return to my native with this image. You also can't go back. We both have to live. I have got only one option. 'Deepi, it's me Mahesh.. Where are you? Call this number' Hello! Hello Mahesh! Deepi, hello! I am Vivek. - Where is Deepika? - She is with me. - Where are you both? - Tell me what happened. He is in Kottayam. You don't be afraid. 'Where have you reached?' 'Thinking about the family, I am very scared' It is because they didn't agree, isn't it? You don't think about all that now. Remain cool. I'll reach on time. You don't be afraid. Okay? Today is a decisive day in your life, isn't it? I tried to conduct it in a straight forward manner. But there is no other alternative than eloping. For us also today is a decisive day. By today our big problem might get solved. Not all of us. The problem of a full village. Is the child sleeping? From the time I got in, I have been noticing. Let her sleep. So many children are sleeping in hunger here. What about the child's mother? There are many motherless children. So you came for the programme and are you leaving with the child? No. Today she is our guest. Where was the programme yesterday? In the VJT hall of Thiruvananthapuram. There are people who did revolution by singing song. We are left with only voice breaking. Nobody is taking our song as music. Everybody is saying it is screaming. To avoid the boredom of this journey, why don't you sing a song? We don't sing just like that. Why? Will you sing only on getting money? No. It is circumstances which make us sing. - I think it is there. - There? Seat No. 3? See. This is local ticket. You can board in sleeper class. Then what will we do? No problem. Get down in the next station and change. She is not feeling well. She has got asthma. You sit here. I'll tell when the TTR comes. - You sit there. - You can sit here. You sit here. Take your ticket. We didn't buy anything while coming.. What to do now? We'll buy on the way. Tea...coffee... Coffee... Where are you both going? We are going to Vega Land. - Is it? - Good. At this age, in which ride are you going to go in Vega Land? At this age we are travelling in train for the first time. It is interesting. Why did you tell that? Then what? What is there in that? It is a good thing. Then...you have something to tell. Am I right? If you don't wish to tell, it is okay. Uh... So you have really got something to tell. Please tell! In a very young age we both loved and got married by eloping. That too we belong to two different castes. So I don't have to tell. You remain silent. There was nobody there for help. By eloping we started our life in a hill place. Then that place became our world. By God's grace we didn't have a child. Like you both, I am also eloping with a girl. Is it? She'll board this train from Eranakulam. In my matter also the reason is the same as yours. You must have given that girl a lot of hopes, isn't it? You must fulfill all that. During dating time I gave her lot of hopes. A life of comfort. But nothing happened. After we started our life together, I couldn't fulfill even a single wish of hers. Inspite of working so hard our limits and responsibilities haven't ended even now. Sometimes our life was taken away by storm. Sometimes there was rain. Sometimes there were intermediates. There is nothing left. But I have no complaints in that. Even if I didn't get anything, he is there with me. By constantly loving me, she developed asthma. Thinking that luck will be with us one day from many years, every month I buy a lottery ticket. First time in my life I won lottery. Rs 5000 of Karunya Plus. We are not in a position to go for pleasure trip. Even then, to fulfill one wish of hers we left with that money. We must go to Eranakulam and return back. Isn't it? "Even after knowing everything is a problem, you came along with me..." "Even when I was in full debt, you didn't leave me." "Even when the family members blamed me, you supported me." "Even when compatriots accused me, you remained as my companion." "You spent your good age by suffering inside my house." "You hugged me even when I came without buying new dress for you for Onam." "You hugged me..." "Even after knowing everything is a problem, you came along with me..." "Even when I was in full debt, you didn't leave me." "Even when the family members blamed me, you supported me." "Even when compatriots accused me, you remained as my companion." "You spent your good age by suffering inside my house." "You hugged me even when I came without buying new dress for you for Onam." "You hugged me..." "You hugged me..." Isn't it this child which is with them? Isn't this the child that is there with you? I am not objecting. Is this child the solution to the problem that you told? Don't stand there. Stand here. I told you, isn't it? Today is a decisive day for us. I don't wish to go deep into this matter. You haven't seen this message. Then there is no problem between us. We'll go and sit there. Come, come on. No need. I'll stand here. You can't stand without us. Come. How smartly you are threatening me! This is a mission. It is not right or wrong but the goal is what is important. You entered this unknowingly. The matters that we tell, you may not be able to understand. It is the problem of your age. This is a fight. The fight for survival. Not mine. But many people. You must help. It is a request. What you are saying or what is your mission I don't know. Holding the life of an innocent child what fight are you doing? Silently! Silently! This is not a fight with just a child. This is the fight for many children who are alive and who are still going to take birth. You must help. It is a command. Why should I obey you? There are laws and regulations in this country. Whatever you may say, I can't support you. I'll report this. A girl is waiting for you in Eranakulam railway station. A life with her is your dream, isn't it? We don't wish to harm you. Please! Don't compel me. Take your hands off. Whatever you may say, I'll not stand by you. Hey, leave. Guys! We must get down here. Come on guys! Come on! Come soon, something has happened there. He must not escape at any cost. Something has happened. What happened? Stop there! Stop! Don't run. Stop! Come on. Stop! - Catch him. - He must not escape. Make it fast. Stop! - Hey, stop! - Stop! Stop! - Hey! - Catch him. Take your hands off. Okay. We are not communist. We don't see this as a crime. Till this mission is over, we must put you to sleep. I am sorry! What happened to the protesters then? Now I have a respect for you There is no history of failing protests Protestors can be killed but not be defeated Haven't you heard? The opposition whatsoever.. ..more likely the protests will get victorious If not today, it will happen someday That is history Hey, please! Stop on the right side. - EC to station. - Are you okay? - I am okay, sir. - Do you want water? - Water. - Get some water. From which area? We have got him near about from the area about which the criminals told. Is there any problem? - SI sir is talking to him. - You drink. Okay. Relax! Sir, some people sedated me from railway station and dropped me here. I know everything. We arrested all of them from the racket. That child is safe. You need not worry. It is good that you recognized them. That is why they got down in Kottayam. Accidentally we arrested them. From the details that we got from the criminals, we came in search of you. We'll take you to the hospital soon. Sir, I don't want to go to the hospital. Then? A girl trusted me and came away with me. She is a dumb girl. I don't even know where she is now. I want to contact her. Can you give me your mobile? Take care of her. I'll start now itself. Please! Send me the location. Now itself I'll send the location map. Don't be tensed. - Come soon. - Okay. - Sir. - What? I need to go to Kozhikodu. If it is not an issue, can you arrange for a vehicle? You need not go like this. Come, we'll make arrangement. Hey! - You make him sit in the jeep. - Yes, sir! Finally, your hero comes. "I think of that first pleasure." "Evening music of happiness." "I think of that first pleasure." "Evening music of happiness." "In that eyes filled with blue sea water..." "The time I saw the depth of soulful music." "I am unable to express the pain of separation." "The delight in the youthful heart wrote the story of life." "The footprints on the path will leave its sign." "Why should we think about it anymore?" "With clouds the door was closed slowly." "The way midnight moon leaves." "Dear you'll disappear in my eyes." "I'll cross any distance for your sake." "It became a magical relationship." "Soulful music became a chanting." "Will you arrive in this as romantic tune?" "My heart will beat at nights thinking of you." "The delight in the youthful heart wrote the story of life." "The footprints on the path will leave its sign." "Why should we think about it anymore?" "I am waiting for you like water in the heat." "Flowery wind embraced the atmosphere." "Thousands of lonely nights passed by." "In the sob of a person." "Without falling in wind it is shaking." "From years onwards you are the wick in the heart." "Will you present me with all the happiness?" "It is the time to soak in the pleasure." "I think of that first pleasure." "Evening music of happiness." "In that eyes filled with blue sea water..." "The time I saw the depth of soulful music." "I am unable to express the pain of separation." "The delight in the youthful heart wrote the story of life." "The footprints on the path will leave its sign." "The delight in the youthful heart wrote the story of life." "The footprints on the path will leave its sign." "Why should we think about it anymore?" Now what will we tell him? Dr. Gautam MBBS. He should be named as 'Made in China' also. - Good morning! - Good morning! You must be the first couple to have celebrated first night in outdoor. Thank you! No need for all that any more. I have arranged for the license. - He is mad. - You told her that I am mad, isn't it? Not that. If children make mistake, elders will punish or rebuke them. If intelligent people like me intervene, they'll forgive without punishment and rebuke. What is he saying? It is difficult for me to shelter you people for many days like others. It is quiet natural. So, yesterday night itself I got into a night conversation. You don't understand, isn't it? Your problems are over. Your love has been accepted by the family members. It is only that it can't take place in the planned time. Reception time can be made as the auspicious time. For that they will come here to take you. Main hurdle is crossed. I am trapped. This is going to be a problem. Why do you look unsatisfied? - Doctor, I need to tell you one thing. - Tell me. Only you can do something. I have already done. Without even your knowledge. It is not that. You need not be afraid. All your problems will end. Just now Anju called and told that Deepika's father and uncle are coming. - Yes. - You are happy, isn't it? What is it? Are you getting hiccups? - Means hiccup. - Neelima sister! Can you give me water to drink? It is hiccup, isn't it? No problem. Just now first night is over. It's alright. Cool! It's okay. They have arrived. Oh God! The decision has been taken. Dear! It is okay. It happened. There is mistake from my side also. Thinking that you are handicapped, I tried to get a guy by paying for it. But, by understanding your shortfalls, he agreed to give you a life. You didn't do anything wrong by leaving with him. You are the one who is correct. Come. Everybody was called. We'll leave now itself. By evening we'll conduct the rituals. There is not much role for us in this emotional scene. Let those 4 to 5 minds unite. Mahesh, I am Deepika's younger uncle. Don't you know him? Sanil, he is Deepika's brother. Okay. We'll talk to your family members. Tomorrow is the marriage day. It is good if we could reach by the reception time. We'll explain to the people. What are you doing? Make them sit in the car. People are like this. Whether it is important or not, they'll keep digging like this in any condition. Sorry! What is this? Doctor, we thank you! It is your who opened my eyes. We doctors even open the heart. Haven't you heard about open heart surgery? Doctor, you also come. You can return as soon as the function is over. Eranakulam! Long drive. Sorry, she is carrying. I am also carrying her. Officially you get them married. I'll sponsor the honeymoon in China. My Beijing colleagues will take care of them. Mahesh, are you happy? Be happy. Does he have patients? Even if there are no patients, we his ancestors are rich, he can enjoy and live like this. Doctor! Doctor! Did you say anything? Even if your ancestors are not rich, by your talent you can live in comfort like this, I said. You have got sense. An happy function is going on there. To make it an auspicious occasion, you come. The sign is good. First you give back that book. I have to leave for Eranakulam today evening. I'll give you the book. You come. Come on. Help me. I have no issue in climbing. Hold me tightly. Menon sir. You scoundrel! - What to do? - What are you doing here? Go man. What cheap act did you do in the train? - Now it has become inauspicious. - Hey, what's happening man? Do you know Mahesh? Mahesh? He is Vivek. A man with no sense. Now not only to me but everyone in the world knows him. He is a womanizer. I don't understand. I'll explain to you. In Eranakulam, this rascal chased a girl from a good family. He tried to charm her. That I know. Yesterday in train, he misbehaved with some other girl. Now he is calling himself as Mahesh. You tell the truth. Are you a fraud? In Eranakulam you are Vivek. In Kozhikodu you are Mahesh. In Sultan Batheri you are Sunil Shetty. Tell me who you are. I was suspicious of him from the time I saw him. Father scolded me when I tried to get that video. See here. Listen to what I have to say. You need not say anything. How did you have the heart to cheat my girl who is a dumb? - Come here. What did you think? - Please! Where are you going? Stop! - Is this your job? - You don't know. You have landed in trouble. Are you trying to cheat our dumb sister? Beat him. Bash him. Who is this new character? Beat and kill him. Do you want only my sister? If you are beating him for kidnapping your sister, you can beat me. I did it. If you come there, we'll kill you. Rascal! Why are you taking the beating? You could have told everything. There was no time for that. They attacked me in no time. How will I thank you for all this? No need for all that. To all these people you are a villain. Everybody here only knows the hero who fights and wins. The heroes who take the beating and lose for the others are also here. You are my hero! Shall we leave then? Son, sorry for everything. It's okay, uncle. - Shall I leave? - All the best! Okay! Come. All the best! You are not a bad guy as I thought, isn't it? A real good person! Menon sir! In story there is always twist, isn't it? The twist is not in story alone. ST 23/2019, Ramakrishnan's son... Have you committed crime? Yes. I don't know the rules here. But he jumped only to save me. It is then that the police arrested him. Who is this person not in the records? In the FIR only the thief, who fell in the well is there. Your honor! What do you have to say? I...in the well... In the well? Why did you go to the well? Why are you crying? Without crying, you tell what happened. Don't waste the time of the court. What is your connection with the case? Please allow to tell. I think that girl is scared. What is happening here? Why has a person, who is not in the FIR come to the court? What discrepancy had taken place in this case? What do you have to tell? In the lord Shiva's temple I was trying to break open the hundi. People tried to catch me that time. In an unknown place I rushed in the darkness. That time I fell in the well unknowingly. Morning when she came to get water, she got scared of me and fell in the well. There are problems in this. I smell suicide effort. Don't you know that committing suicide is a crime? Court can file a case by itself. That...in well... She became scared of me and fell. Did you fall when the people chased you in the middle of theft? Is there any change in that? No. The matter is not very convincing. Let him remain in remand. Why did you say like that? Why didn't you tell that you jumped to save me? You could have escaped. There is a truth in all thefts. That is what is correct. Let it remain like that. If your love is true, the boy who ditched you, will return. Even if he doesn't return, she doesn't deserve your love. I'll leave. I think he might come to me. Like how it happened in their life. - Bro Vivek! - Hi! - Hi! - Hi! Hi buddy! - Welcome back. - Thank you! Thank you so much! Hi man! - Sir... - Do you know, Carnival cares for its employees. As well as its moral ethics. Any company will be conscious about its employees moral side. It'll directly affect our reputation. On hearing such a news about you we could react only like that. But, on knowing you are innocent, same time the company called you back. Carnival is an employee friendly company. Sir. - Sir, excuse me! - Okay. Sorry! Sorry...It's alright, Ima. I was in love with you. You knew that very well. Many times I came to express that to you. But do you know what you told me? You have only friendship with me. If you had been a good friend, when there was a problem in my life, atleast to hear me out you could have stood by me. On the other hand, you ignored me. When you come to continue such a friendship, how else should I react to you? Anyway, I don't want this friendship. Please! No need. I don't want this friendship. I had a thought. I am very different and intellectual as you used to tease me. But I understood that I am nothing like that. Even after knowing you love me, I was converting it as a friendship. Even this attire of mine. No need for all that. No use of this confession. If you can't understand the possessiveness of a girl towards a man, what kind of a lover are you? Wasp! Hay! What? How? Wasp! You! "Seeing a flower bud passing by..." "There are some dreams in my heart." "In the song that can be heard in the air..." "Two parrots are coming together in a nest." "Let us do some sweet talks and laugh together." "Slowly petal will bloom." "Is it a rose flower?" "This love will develop in us." "Regularly it can be heard." "Are they the spring music?" "Unknowingly your love will melt." "Closely in the soul..." "Thousands of sweet wishes will rise." "It is such a pleasure!" "Sweet words will flow." "It'll spread happiness." "Two souls are bringing together desirable music." "Slowly petal will bloom." "Is it a rose flower?" "This love will develop in us."
