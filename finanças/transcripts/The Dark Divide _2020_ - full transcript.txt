Hey. Which pump? Oh, uh. I'm just messing with you. There's only one. Oh. That's a new one. Oh yeah, I mean you can't knock it. Tourists, love them. They just go nuts for that crap. Oh, I'm sure they do. What's the saying? There's one born every minute. Ooh. Hello. So where are you headed? The Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Which reminds me, I've been having a little difficulty here. So let me, wait, no, no. All right, I thought it went this way. All right, I need to go this way. Unfortunately, I am not as good at cartographer as I am a lepidopterist, uh okay. What? - I'm looking. - What are we doing? Bear with me one second, please. Okay, because, let's see. So we be, oh yeah. Am I here? You are here. Ah, okay. You one of those owl people. No, no, no, no, no. I'm actually searching for new species of butterfly, Butterflies? And moths. In fact, three years ago, I discovered six new species and that is a Xerces Society record, and I've authored several books on the subject. You don't say. Yeah, that's kind of a big deal, just so you know. And I should be getting there just in time for the hatch. Much money in butterflies? - And moths. - And, and moths. Yes, um, normally, no, but I do have a Guggenheim. You hunt butterflies with a gun? No, it's a grant. And one doesn't hunt butterflies, good grief. Where are you hiking to? I'm going from Highway 12, over Mount Adams to the Columbia Gorge. On foot? Yeah. Jesus, how long does that take? Well, I'm anticipating up to a month. Didn't Petras brothers do something like that back in '88? Yeah, they sure did. They got their ass kicked. Well. Yeah, he's right. I mean, you should not do this right now. That's trail's no joke. The bears have slept awful long. They're gonna be extra hungry. I think I'll be, I'll be fine. Thank you though. I've done several overnights in the field, so. Overnights. Overnights? Perhaps I should get another bag of peanuts. For the, it's a long trip. It's not the first time I've ever heard that. Getting it in right the first time. It was so funny. See you in the rec room. But you can't have bees in your walls, Bob, you're going to have to spray before summer comes. They're harmless honeybees. Nature's pollinators. Harmless? When it heats up, you're going to have every rat in the county running around your place. I didn't realize your PhD in art history made you an expert on rodents, Carl. Who's to say that the chemicals that we spray on so-called nuisance species, aren't affecting other insect populations. You know? And that's another reason why my Gifford Pinchot expedition is so critical. Nobody has amassed a comprehensive list of the Lepidoptera in the region. And until we catalog all the species that reside there, how are we gonna know whether their numbers are dwindling? That is a great point. In fact, tell us a little bit more about this proposal of yours. I assume that you already have a start date, you've already planned out. I don't have a date as of yet. My, my class schedule is, is just crazy this semester. So you're going during the summer break. Oh that's terrific. Summer makes perfect sense. Yeah. Not necessarily, I don't have a date as of yet. It's really a complicated endeavor, gentlemen. Yeah, it must be. You've been talking about this for years now. Yeah. So Bob, will you bring your supplies with you or are you going to have them drop by helicopter? Well, I suppose, I suppose there's a, you bring some and then others are dropped and then one would have. You have gym membership, you've been going right? Checking it out, getting yourself ready. I'm, I'm in very good shape. My BMI is actually a, I can't remember if it's a low or high, but whatever that number it's supposed to be is, it's better. Bob, you've been camping before, right? Yes, of course I've been camping before. Cub Scouts, that kind. I mean, have I done a, an expedition, no. but I've been overnight. What happens if you get sick? Sprained ankle, something like that? What if you broke your leg, Bob? What if you lost your glasses? There are mountain lions out there too. Rattlesnakes. And tigers. Okay, okay. Have you ever sucked the venom out of a poisonous bite, Bob, ever? Big rivers you can drown in. I went to the rental car place and I see this giant broken down station wagon that they're gonna junk, and I'm like that one. Give me that one. And they did. And I drove it up to 84 and I get it going 105. No. And then I come around the corner and all of a sudden there it is that big yellow sign, runaway truck ramp. Tell them, tell them. Oh well, it. The car bottomed out, she snapped the front axle, and Thea broke her nose and chipped her two front teeth on the steering wheel. Oh goodness. Yes, those are plastic. Oh my God. So, reckless and irresponsible. Irresponsible? Yes. What are you talking about? I sprung for the insurance when I rented it. Okay, that wasn't what. You all right? Mm-hmm. You okay? Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. I just want to tell them about you. Are, you all right? Mm-hmm. So exciting. Bob's publisher can't wait to read the first draft of his next book. Mm, yes. Well, are you going to be doing the illustrations for this one as well? Well, of course. How are you going to find another artist who knows the difference between an Arabia Magdalena and a common Alpine? Can't be done. You can't, they don't exist. Well, I can't wait to read it. And I, for one, can't wait to get started working on it. And I mean that quite literally, I mean, I truly can't wait. Can I have a water? Yeah, of course, of course. Okay, thanks. Come on, big fella. Oh God, sorry, sorry. Bob, let's dial back on you being so miserable. Well, I apologize, but my wife is. Alive. I'm alive. I know. I know. I know. I'm okay. I know. I know. Stop, no! Ow, quit it, don't! Don't. Thea. I'm fine, I'm fine, look. No, you're not fine. Yes I am. Honey. Grab your girlfriend, Marsha. Go look for specimens. No. And scribble down some of that poetry you keep threatening to write. Just, just get away from me for awhile. No. Thea no, hey, hey, hey. I'm here right now. What can I do? Go. I already made you a lunch, it's with Marsha. Go. Just go chase something. Thank you. You're welcome. I love you. I love you more. Ma'am, don't change your baby on the air hockey table. One adult, no children. I'm joining a birthday party. Hey Steve, do we have a birthday party scheduled today? Don't test me, dude. Game over.

If I did that, it would have had to go all the way through, I take it back. Oh gosh, sorry. Sorry. Jesus! She thought he was a spirit hidden in the woods. She thought you were a bigfoot. Do I look like a god damn bigfoot to you? You almost shot me. It's okay. You almost shot me. You're gonna hike all the way to the gorge? Yes, I'm on a field study on lepidoptera in the region. I have a Guggenheim. I got a Guggenheim. That trail you've been hiking, was a highway for 20,000 years. My ancestors would trade salmon from the river, obsidian from the Oregon deserts, seashells from the coast. The four corners of this land, where the volcanoes. Tahoma to the North, Paito to the East, Wais to the South and Lewit to the West. Our stories say that Wais and Lewit were once lovers who were turned to stone. Lovers. The tribes met at Council Lake at the base of Pato, but they abandoned because there's too many bigfeet there. They renamed it Cotas Lake, Bad Lake. So there's more than one bigfoot? Okay, so doc, what do you think? Tell me, your thoughts. Do you believe bigfoot exists? No, I don't believe that bigfoot exists. At least not in the traditional sense. I do believe he exists as a sort of totem or a symbol. My man. Totem. But you've seen things you can't explain. That is true. Come on. You're, you screwing around? Grandpa saw one. Grandpa saw a lot of things. The old boy loved his peyote ritual. Tried to convince everybody he was a medicine man. He was really just an old pot head. So is your dad. You know that. That's why your mom, lovely woman that she is, traded up. They were Holy men, and you eat peyote you don't smoke it. Okay. Either way. Just bunch of old dopers, that's all. Holy men. It's our heritage. Some heritage, am I right? What do you got that's so great besides a disability check? Hey, hey hey, easy biggun. Let it go, let it go. Buncha. Bigfoot sleeps in lava tunnels. Deep beneath Pato. He protects the forest and its creatures. But when white man gets too greedy and steals too much of his land, bigfoot smashes his trucks as revenge. All right, Shane, that is enough. Why do you always turn into such an ass when other white people are around? What? - Uh. - You heard me. I don't. I didn't even know he's white, how about that? You're white? Uh, yes. You don't raise your voice to me. Or what, you'll move out? Huh? I might. So, you're married? I was. Well, when did you guys split up? We didn't split up. Oh. I met her in mushroom class. About this time every year she would get fungus fever, is what she would call it. And we'd go out hunting and, but she's good. She was good. She was, she, she was, she was very good. I wouldn't want to be a chanterelle in a forest with her. And I fell in love with her the second I heard her name. Thea Linnaea. Linnaea, like the little twin flowers. Linnaea borealis, yes. You know, he was a good man once. Sometimes he still is. He forgets how angry he is. Well, I can't say I blame him. You know there's, a lot to be angry about. Life is exceptionally unfair. I was hoping that this journey would help me get through that, you know, so that I could move on. Maybe you should start looking to yourself for the answers. Thank you. A little hungry. Look out, look out, look out! All right, back it up. Oh wow, if it isn't the owl nut. What? Oh, you're the man from the gas station. I knew there was something about you I didn't like. I don't know how you did it or how many men you had. How you did this without a winch. Whoa whoa whoa, gentlemen, gentlemen. Gentlemen, let's be rational here. It would take at least. You're going to tell me or I'm gonna beat it out of you. Oh, weapons of mass destruction in here. You can't just go around beating people up. Hey! Oh yeah, why not? Because, I have a Guggenheim. He's got a gun. It's not a gun, you idiot. Let that poor guy go before he pisses himself. And go start those slash piles. Go on, get the work. What the hell you guys do, join union while I was at lunch? Slash pile. We're just having a little fun. Here comes that hippie, you better get back to work. Hey! Hey, I want the names of those men. No. You can have some coffee though. How long you been on the trail? Two weeks. Or no, longer maybe. I don't know. I, I, I guess I've lost track. Seems ill advised to be hiking so long without a radio or a rifle. What if you run into a bear? I did. We worked it out. And the only dangerous animals I've run into are your men. Well, you'll just have to forgive them. They've been through an awful lot these last few years. Thanks to this spotted owl nonsense. Nonsense. You're talking about a species that will never be back. We'll never see it again. Along with who knows how many others. And once they're gone, that's it. They're gone forever, okay. You don't, you don't get to snap your fingers and have them come back. You know, there's no, they're gone forever. And then all we have are memories. Have you ever seen a spoted owl? No, because they're very rare because they're endangered. Well count your lucky stars. Mean sons of bitches. I'm glad to see them go. Hey, that's terrible. That's a terrible thing to say. I'm sure it is to someone like you. Okay. Thanks to misinformed do-gooders like yourself. There's too many trees, too much brush. Too many regulations. Okay. Fewer plants mean fewer insects. Fewer insects mean fewer frogs and birds. Fewer frogs and birds means fewer larger mammals. Fewer of them means fewer of us. On that, we agree. Okay, good. Good. How, in what way? Now that we're not able to thin the stands like we used to, like we should, every fire season nature does it for us. Only her fires are faster and longer than they used to be. Because there's 70 years of fuel on the forest floor. It's only gonna get worse and worse and worse till there ain't nothing left. And you'll probably blame us for that, too. You ever heard of a rustic bunty? I don't know. You remind me of a rustic bunty. Saw one the other day. Brown bird about that big. Ought to be in Siberia. But here it was. Dumb little bird, stupid little bird. Surprised if it lives another week out here. Can I get another cup of coffee, please. No. Drop the wood over there.
