Come on, girls, let's do this. Turn a bit. That's right. Now fix your hair. Like that. Very good. Smile. Stay. Take it! Noemí, move to the right. Greta, you go in the middle. But not so close together. Like that! Very good! That's it. Freeze. Now, take it. Okay, now switch again. Denise, move to the left. Yes, to the left. Okay, let's go. Smile. Freeze. Take it. Good. Okay, we're done for today. That's all. Thanks a lot. Now, Inge and Mary, get in position. You three can go home. Let's go. Smile. Inge, raise your arms over your head. But gracefully. With ease. That's right. Mary, lean to the right. Touch your knee. Good. Thanks. You can go. - Here. - Thanks. - See you tomorrow? - Yes. Take care. Bye. - What's up? You're not in a rush today? - I wanted to talk with you. We just spent three long hours together. It's always last minute with you. - I was waiting for us to be alone. - Is it so important? Yes. Okay. But make it quick. Sit down. Thanks. I'm fine. Okay. What is it? It's about Kathy. What's wrong with Kathy? You know that we're roommates. Yes, I know. Kathy has been missing for over a month. She must have found a job somewhere else. She would have told me. Kathy is my best friend. A boy? That must be it. Kathy is having a fling... and one day soon she'll come back and tell you all about it. No, Lillian. It isn't a boy and you know it. What business is it of mine? I hire you to model, that's it. But you haven't called Kathy since she left. You must know something. That's purely a coincidence. I don't know anything about this. You'd rather I call the police? Don't do that. You know perfectly well where Kathy is and what she's doing. I demand that you tell me. She's on a special assignment. When it's finished, you'll find out. But why the big mystery? It's part of a product launch. We have to keep it top secret... until the time is right. You don't believe me? I have this feeling that Kathy is in trouble. I wanted to keep you out of all this. You'll find out the truth. Meet me at 7:00 at the quay next to dock 73. I'll be on time. You weren't expecting me? We said 7:00 sharp. Why are you early? Being suspicious only makes it worse. You still haven't told me. That's not my job. It depends on the person who's paying. You'll find out soon. I need to tell her right away about your involvement. Well, here I am. And I'm not going to fall for any of your tricks! Follow me. - Go in. - You first. Why are you stopping? Come in. You're very early. - Who's this? - Noemí. Kathy's friend. - Does Mr. Tucker know she's here? - No. - I don't think he's going to like it. - There was no choice. She said she'd go to the police. - Why? - To tell them that Kathy is missing. They live together. You should have warned him. It was a question of time. Can't you just tell me where Kathy is? - The middle of the ocean. - What? - At 7:00 you can hear her yourself. - She's been hired for an advertisement. In the middle of the ocean? Are you people crazy? Honestly, I also felt that way at first. But now I'm used to the idea. In any case, the world of advertising is full of extravagance. I'm listening, but I don't understand a thing. I know, I'll explain. I'm Howard Tucker, of Tucker Sporting Goods. I've used the services of Barbie Studios on more than one occasion. And now, Lillian has helped me to bring a colossal idea to life... by introducing to the whole world... a new type of sporty lifeboat. So, Kathy is really out in the ocean? - Yes. - Alone? She's with the starlet Lorena Day who is playing the role of ship captain. But what is the point of this? We've placed them at a spot that's regularly passed by other ships... so that they'll find them by chance. The news will be spread around the world. "Two beautiful ladies in a boat that have survived... "a very dangerous trip for small boats." Why didn't you follow them? That would have ruined the idea. We'll have to wait and see what its impact will be. It shouldn't seem like it was planned. If they're alone and abandoned... the news will be spread by the media all around the world. There will be photographs and television reports. Exactly, that's true. This is all very risky. You think so? Not as much as it seems. The Tucker sports boat has undergone very rigorous testing. If that isn't enough, a helicopter is ready to comb the waters at the slightest alarm. They know what they're doing, and agreed to a considerable sum. I wouldn't have gone for all the money in the world. I would have. That means our friend Lillian Barbie knows how to select the right people for a job. Here they are. You'll hear them. This is H.T. H.T. speaking. Do you read me? This is H.T. H.T. speaking. Do you read me? Operation Atlantic. Operation Atlantic. We hear you perfectly, H.T. Over. Describe situation. - This is Noemí. How's Kathy? - Be quiet. - Let them tell us where they are. - Describe situation. I'm fine, Noemí. How did you find out? Secret, my eye. If she says a word, goodbye, Hollywood contract. Skip the commentary and describe your situation. Over. Here you go, you pain in the neck. We're basically in the same place as yesterday. There's a thick fog. It's impossible to use the stars for guidance. We prefer to stay on deck. What does she mean, on deck? They turned off the engine. They're waiting. - But where are they now? - I don't think they've moved very much. Tell me, Atlantic, are you maintaining your speed? Over. The compass is still pointing north, like we had discussed. Don't make things more complicated now. This fog is really thick. It's so hot, everything seems very strange. Instead of going north, I think we're heading for the tropics. And now all of a sudden there is no sea and no sky. - It's a strange feeling. - Kathy. - Over. - Look! Over there! What's going on? Report incident. Report incident. Do you read me? - A strange ship is coming toward us. - Fire the warning shots. - Do you hear me? Use the gun. - Lorena, the flares! Get the megaphone. Is there anyone on board? Give it to me. Is there anyone on board? Here. They haven't responded to the signal. It's a very old ship. - There's nobody on deck. - Fire more shots. It's getting closer. It's moving without the rudder. Can't we do something for them? - It's right on top of us. - It's going to hit us! It just grazed us. Lorena and I are fine. The boat, on the other hand, seems to have sprung a little leak. It isn't serious at the moment. We don't know if it will stay like this. Lorena is draining it as fast as she can. Over. The boat will hold out. It's made for anything. Get away from the ship. It may be dangerous. Dangerous? But we told you, there's nobody on board. The boat is floating now, but it could sink next time. Don't pretend that this toy boat will be able to overpower... a ship that has lasted a few centuries. I'll send you a helicopter. And when should we expect it? I'm sorry, but I want to be rescued immediately. This is an emergency. - Do as I say! - Take it. Don't worry, Mr. Tucker. I'll hold on here as long as I can. Do what you want. I'm getting out of here. Here, Kathy. Hold it. Those idiots are going to spoil everything. They have the right to take precautions. Mind your own business. Here's half of Operation Atlantic. The other half is safe. Nothing has changed. Try to come for us tomorrow... because I don't think I can spend another night alone in the boat. You'll figure out what to do. Over and out. The plan failed. You've already seen it. The only thing we can do is get those girls as soon as possible. And very discretely. Pray to Heaven that nothing happens to Kathy. Otherwise, the media will jump all over this scandal. You're not leaving until everything is solved. Let go of me! - You can't do this! - It'd be better if you shut up. You're mixed up in this thing, too. Let me handle it, everything will be fine. Let go! Let go! Get off me! How long do you plan on keeping me here? Don't worry. We'll let you go eventually. - I want water. - You have everything here. I always drink water when I eat. Fine. - Let's go. - No. Come on. We could have been friends, but you wanted it this way. This is Sergio. Sergio to H.T. This is Sergio. Sergio to H.T. Do you read me? This is H.T. I hear you, Sergio. Over. We've been circling around a 50-mile area. No sign of the boat or the mystery ship. I guarantee there has been no fog in this area for several days. We have an observation boat located here... that provides irrefutable meteorological information. Especially if we're talking about an obvious phenomenon, such as this one. Then, can you explain how we were talking with some girls the day before yesterday... who were in the middle of this mass of fog? - That's what they said? - Yes. And that there was a nearly tropical heat. In the North Sea? Listen, are these girls big drinkers? Have they pulled pranks before? You're on the wrong path, Prof. Grüber. These girls work for me. Get it? - I pay them. - Okay, don't be mad. I only said that because one never knows with young people. From now on, there will be no jokes made at my expense. That's your problem. I have no more time for this. You can believe your girls or me. There was no fog. That's it. Let's go. One second. Prof. Grüber. Prof. Grüber. What do you want now? Nothing. I just thought of something, but it isn't important. Thank you. I wanted to ask you about the ship. What? What about a ship? Did they mention something? It was more of the girls' silliness. One second. What did they say? Did they see the ship? Yes. And they went on board. That's what they told us. Where are these girls? May I speak with them? No. They haven't responded to us. And we can't find their location. They won't be coming back. - Forget that idea. - What do you mean, they won't come back? You won't see them again. That's it. - But why? - What do you know about this? The ship exists. Some have seen it sailing in those waters. What does that have to do with them coming back or not? There are no witnesses. Nobody has survived. The only information we have about the abandoned ship... is from telegrams... and radio messages from different boats. Always small ones. There are descriptions here written by telegraphists... from fishing boats, and the captains of yachts. None of them have returned. The sea swallowed them and didn't leave a trace. But the boat has never been located. Nothing. They've used planes and torpedoes. Countless searches have been fruitless. I don't understand it. - That's where the legend comes from. - What legend? The one about the haunted ship. Have you really never heard it? We're not going to waste time on stories. Right, you're a practical man. I only believe in what I see and feel. My scientific training demands that I be rigorous... and that I base my work on solid... and precise principles. - But I have changed. - Why? Strange things sometimes happen out at sea. - Like this haunted ship? - Yes, like that. I don't believe in ghosts. I'm taking my yacht, and we're going to find those girls. You really want to go? Do you realize the risk involved? When I want something... I get it by my own means. Of course. And with your yacht, no less. Listen. You know, the ship can only be seen from a small boat. Professor, keep believing your fantasies. One minute, wait. I'm not going to miss a chance to see the haunted ship. This is Operation Atlantic. Do you read me? This is Operation Atlantic. I can't hear a thing. My earphones are damaged. I don't know if you can hear me. Just in case, I will give you today's report. The boat is in the same position in terms of the ship. I have no news from Lorena. For some strange reason, I was sleeping all day. I can't explain it. It's still very foggy. The heat is very intense, and I think that's what's causing my dreams. The boat fills up sometimes, and I don't feel like draining it. The idea of staying alone tonight is driving me crazy. I'm very sorry, but I can't wait anymore. I'm going aboard the ship to find Lorena. I hope you heard me. Over and out. Lorena! If we stay on this path, we'll arrive at the place soon. - Do you think we'll find something there? - Yes, definitely. I don't get it. Why did you get involved in this fiasco? Sometimes I wonder if it's worth living a life as stagnant as mine... among mariners' charts and letters sent from one explorer to another. Today, I hope to come face to face with the haunted ship. Don't you? All I want is to come out alive, Professor. Don't hold a grudge for the forceful way I treated you. I couldn't let you run off and tell the police. What do you think I'll do once we're back on land? We will have already found your friend by then. Kathy will deny your statement. - What makes you so sure? - I pay her well. It's always about money. You repulse me. What happens if we don't find those girls? - We'll find them. - Let's say we don't. The media and my enemies will crush me. I'll be held responsible, and I'll have to give up my political life. Does that worry you very much? It represents years of hard work. The party is going to back me for governor. Everything will fall apart. Unless we invent a little... story. What? - What story? - A logical explanation. The girls were taking a pleasure cruise. A party, lots of drinking. They went up on deck and were knocked overboard by a wave. These things sometimes happen. Sergio and I will corroborate the story. Who can contradict us? What about Noemí and the professor? Nobody knows that they came with us. They'll be two missing persons with no connection between them. Lorena! Are you here? No! No! Look, Professor. Then it was true. Here it is. How do you explain the failure of your control tower? This fog isn't normal. Don't you feel a strange heat... - that seems unnatural? - Yes. Where is it coming from? We're submerged in a completely different dimension. Ridiculous. You're a sore loser, Professor. Yes. Soon we will see the ship. - It would be safer to turn back. - Continue on course until further orders. The fog keeps getting thicker. Full speed ahead. Whatever you say. Stop the engines. Tie up the boat. It would be safer to go around to get on board. I said, tie up the boat. Fine. There's the ladder! They've survived. I hope you're right. Don't you know how to sail this ship? I will explain it to you, Mr. Tucker. We're in the middle of a nightmare. Neither this fog... or this ship are real. Nothing is certain. Science refutes it. This place does not exist. And you, are you real? I'm not sure that science wouldn't refute you, too. You know, I'm beginning to doubt... whether we are real, either. What we need is some light. And this. You are a practical man, Mr. Tucker. That's the difference between empiricism and theory. Come! Look! - What is that? - Kathy's bag. No surprises there. We already know they're on the boat. You do what you want. I'm going to find them. I give the orders around here. Don't forget that. Come on! They took the boat. Not at all. The yacht went back to the normal dimension. When it appears, nobody will know what became of us. And only the files will remain, another mystery of the sea. Do you find that funny? Everyone get to the quarters. Tomorrow we will have time to settle in. Leave me alone. You are worried. - I've never seen you so insecure. - Shut up. You're living a nightmare that neither your business, your bank account... nor your party can help you escape. And you're thrilled, right? It's a new situation. You're not powerful Tucker anymore. It's odd. - But I'm having fun. - What are you doing? I'm leaving. I don't want to be alone. Stay. For how long do you think I'll obey your orders? I told you to stay. What will you give me in return? You live off me. Everything has changed. Don't you realize? I'm not your slave. I don't know how all this will end. But I can't help feeling satisfied at being almost free. Don't leave me now, Sergio. I'm scared. Say it louder. I'm scared! Not much studying going on here. - I fell asleep. - I noticed. I was dreaming that I was a magazine model like you. I imagined myself wearing beautiful outfits, and surrounded by lights. Do you think I could be a model? Definitely. But your parents want you to be a good secretary. So you should hit the books. I asked them. - What? - I asked them if I could drop out. - They told you no. - No. They agree, if you say I can do it. - Wow! - Will you help me? - Will you really help me? - Calm down, crazy. With your help, I'll learn how to walk, smile, dress... and do all the things in the ads. What's up? I'm ecstatic. I was offered a contract for some ads. And you accepted? Of course. I'm going to the Riviera. I'm going to meet important people. What's wrong? You don't like the idea. It's the first time we'll be apart. You're grown up now. You have to learn to take care of yourself. I can't baby-sit you forever. Come on, don't take it like that. It was a joke. How could I leave you? - Are you telling the truth? - Of course. We'll stay together. Don't worry. Thank you. You're the best! Kathy, are you here? Kathy? Kathy, are you here? Answer, for God's sake! Kathy! No! Help. Help. Don't leave me alone. No. Help. Help. No. Help! - Look at what I found. - Leave it. We need to find the girls. Where do you think they could be? We've looked down every hatchway. - Here is the key to the whole puzzle. - What is it? The navigation log. Forget the stories, Professor. The girls are on this boat, and we must find them. Don't be so blind to the facts. The girls haven't come to us because they are not on this ship. Are you suggesting they jumped ship? I told you, the key is here. - Do you want to listen or not? - Try and be brief. Always so impatient. This is the navigation log that belonged to the captain of this ship. Turns out he was a knight known as "The Dutchman." He returned from the East with militants from a blasphemous order of knights... derived from the Knights Templar. He was excommunicated by the Pope... and cursed for his satanic ceremonies. But that goes back to the 8th century. And this ship is from the 16th century. How very observant of you. But according to what it says here... these sects, with their sacrifices to the forces of evil... were able to overcome death. - This ship came two centuries later. - I've heard too much already. - Let's go find the girls. - Wait a little longer. On this ship, apart from a large treasure... there are boxes shaped like sarcophagi... that contain the mummified corpses of some of the sect members. Every night, they come back to life to continue their feast of blood. Is it possible that you, a scientist, actually believe these ridiculous things? Yes. Technically, I shouldn't believe in these things. But what other explanation is there for what is happening to us? I don't know. This ship is sailing among masses of fog that don't exist in any meteorological report. And it isn't detected by radar or navigational controls. It can only be seen once you are lured in. A small, defenseless boat. You all know the rest. How many hours have they slept? Check your watch, Mr. Tucker. Fourteen hours. Of course, a very deep sleep. Just like some carnivorous plants. It already happened last night. And more of us will fall victim to these evil creatures. Those are just fantastical legends. There is a logical explanation for what happened. We need to search the ship. You go with Lillian, and Sergio will come with me. Okay, fine. If you want to waste time... - Where should we start? - By that hatchway. - Sergio and I will go to the quarters. - This way. Do you want to go down first? Or do you want me to go? It doesn't matter to me. Then I'll go down first. We don't know what we'll find down there. You're really encouraging me. Good. That way your curiosity will be stronger. Noemí, where are you? Are you here? - You scared me to death! - Sorry. - I don't know what's happening to me. - You don't have to apologize. That's fear. Just like my own. We'll have to see what's in these boxes. We should tell Tucker so he can help us. No. It's better to open them before they wake up... in case they are inside. Now. - What happened? - Sorry. - It was a rat. - I thought you had been attacked. Professor. Look at this. What? That it doesn't break? Keep hitting it, and you'll see how dark it can get here. - But didn't you hear? It's hollow. - Let's see. No doubt about it. There was a hidden chamber here. This could be the answer. Maybe the girls are locked in there. No. Don't get your hopes up. I'm going to get the others so we can remove this panel. No. You stay sitting here with the lantern. And stay quiet until we come back. Don't move. Over here. It's here. Indeed, there's a room here. We have to get going on this. What are you waiting for? Take a look at this. Look. In all devil-worshipping practices... isn't Satan depicted with the horns and hooves of a goat? I think I hear footsteps. Did you hear? We have to get out of here right away. Let's go, Lillian! Sergio, help! They caught my foot. Please, get me out of here! - What can we do? - Let's lock ourselves in a room. They'll still get us. There must be another solution. All I know is we have to do something now. We have to use the medieval procedures. - Does anyone have a lighter? - With gasoline? - I have one. - I do, too. I think it will work. Here. Have you heard of exorcisms? It's a way of chasing away the Devil. Get back, you hellish creatures. Back! Go back to the hell from which you came. Back! Go back, Satan. Go back. Go back. Go back to the hell from which you came, monsters from hell. Help! - Help! Come! - Help! Help! - They can't hear us. - Or see us. They're blind and deaf. I told you, we are in another dimension. Quiet! We're stuck here and we have to wait. We shouldn't seek help from the outside. Those creatures may attack us any second. We have barely half an hour before they come out of their coffins. What are we going to do? They'll destroy any obstacle we put in their way. - The cross! - We have no gasoline. And the wood is too wet to burn. Well, then... Are we going to give in to these infernal creatures? That's it. Infernal. That's the key. Of course. If they were real, nothing would happen to us. Their strength comes at night. In the shadows. Yes, that's true. Which means... that right now, they are harmless. Help me! - One second. What will you do? - Destroy them! We have to throw them into the sea. There's a few minutes left. Let's go. Up. Up. Let's go. Careful, Sergio. Let's go. - Do you think we're out of danger? - They can't do anything to us now. But we have to get out of here. Didn't you say that we're in a magic world? Now that those demons have disappeared, I think everything will change. Listen. Look. We're close to the shore. Now we really are back in our world. We have to steer the ship there. I'm afraid this is very old wood. It won't float without the magic powers. We could find a boat. It's so close we could swim. Help me. We'll hold onto this piece. Will it float with all four of us? No. Three. I can't swim. Let's go, Sergio. - Leave those stones. - I found them. - You can't take the extra weight. - That's my decision. Give them to the professor. He'll return them on shore. What if this old heap sinks before I get back? Wasting time won't help matters. Bye. We'll be back for you, Professor. Hurry. I'm not safe here at all. This wood can't take any more weight. Let's go. - We have to wait for Tucker. - No, we'll drown. - Leave the bag! - Never! - We'll all drown. - I don't know about you... but I'm saving myself and the jewels. - I told you to drop them! - No. No! Murderer. Leave them! Drop them right now! Murderer!
