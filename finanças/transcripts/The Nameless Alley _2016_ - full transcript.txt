Babak seems like a nice person He's 18 years older than you and he has his own family "He's older" Age is a number, Babak is baby faced he looks in his early thirties He's getting a divorce too You think mum and dad let you marry him if they know he's already married?

He'll call -He's probably gotten busy -He left in a mood You should thank God for such a nice boy. A true gentleman Well mannered and genuine We'll hopefully find him a very good girl too Why should he get married? -He's still a kid -He needs to get married eventually Why should everyone be married? Am I dead now that I don't have a husband? We'll have to marry them off. Do you want to keep him forever? Once he's 30, with a stranger What is it?

Lower your voice, you and the way you dress Don't start on how I dress, I want to dress like this and I don't care what people think Have some shame, I'm saying all of this for you, you idiot If he meant well he'd never met up out on the street -He'd marry you -Whatever -Your friends taught you all of this -Oh! It's Niloofar? Nazi? Has Fatemeh made up stories again? It's so embarrassing in a house where everyone is mourning -You're out on the street doing your own thing -Mum I'll kill myself I'm done with you! You'll have to sort it out with your dad I've raised two girls nothing happened this one is different Mum? Mum? Why do you do this? Why do you do this? The guilty ones always show themselves up What do you mean? What's it got to do with dad? You've driven me crazy I swear I'll leave this house Calm down, you wait till your dad gets back then you can go Enough is enough -Why do you argue with her? -I didn't say anything It's not right to pray so fast It's not the longest prayer in the world My knees are hurting What's happening with Forough? She's locked her door and imprisoned herself. We're lucky if she doesn't go mad It's none of my business but neighbours will make up stories We should prepare for the funeral as soon as possible Your daughter is worse than anyone else You should be real proud of yourself Haji Mehdi She doesn't pray The way she dresses All the makeup she puts on. I don't know where she's even come from What can we do? Fighting won't make it go away You're pretending nothing has happened? -Nasibeh will turn out the same soon -God She's an adult I can't exactly hit her If you talk to kids, you can't ever control them anymore Keep defending her then! You know what she's done? I saw her get out of a man's car I knew she was up to something When I tell her, she gets worse she says it's my life I know what to do! Cheeky I swear I can't control her anymore The two of you can sort it out between you We lived near the countryside It'd be filled with poppies in the spring I was around 8-9 when dad brought me into town to work as a shoemaker I never went back for springs Because I was working hard all year round I just worked I was content with the fact that... My kids will lead happy lives The things I did You might not be able to be proud of like other girls But I worked hard in summer and winter Thinking I have a family together I don't care what people say I just want you to swear to God Whatever you do Don't forget there's a God He's watching over you That's all Come on get inside Hi grandad -Hi dad -Hi dad -Come here Taha -Are you okay dad? -Hi darling, oh hi Mojtaba! -Why do you look so pale? -I'm fine darling it's nothing -You want me to take you to the doctor's My pressure has dropped a little How are you? The fruits look fresh -Take some -I thought I should talk to you about Hamid's funeral We were just talking about it before you got here He says Forough is not letting us go ahead It's not right in front of the family. You want me to talk to her? I can't think of anything you do whatever you think is right Come here love. Be careful with the well -We never know what's going to happen next -Mum? God decided to take him away the perfect way he was We can't object to what God decides Let's go ahead with the funeral Careful love Go on, are you okay? -Hi -Hope your prayers are accepted -Hi auntie -Hi darling -You're praying with nail polish on? -Leave her alone -Go get the kettle from downstairs -She's not well can't you see? -I'll go mum -Go on! Miss goody two shoes I'm not a good for nothing like you Look a good for nothing is a man who stays in his in-law's house -Mohadeseh watch your mouth -I am Watch your language Mohadeseh -We have a funeral -Good for nothing are those who take out loans all the time -It's haram you idiot! -Are you a strong believer now? -She's angry over something else -Where from mum? You saw me with my boyfriend? Good! I had the right to. Dad didn't say anything Such a bitch! That's what happens when the man of the house is too soft You're right! A good for nothing is who he stays in mum's house for 6 months without a month's rent -It's none of your business -It totally is! It's our money too Poor me! My kids are dishing out my inheritance before I'm even gone Go ahead, give her everything. You pretend you don't know what your husband's doing -Are you jealous? -Yeah! -You're jealous? -Yeah! -Hope you'll be happy like me -You're happy? I'll never want to be "happy" like you -Shut the door before you shout at least -Enough is enough! -Mohadeseh you're going too far! -No let's see what she has to say We're making things clear -You're worried about the house? -Yeah -I'll leave the house tomorrow -Go on then! Mum it's your fault for picking favourites -She's pregnant Mohadeseh -So what? You'd never be this rude if I was around! Ehteram Hamid called! -Thank God! -Where had he been all this time? I couldn't hear him clearly. I'll tell Ensieh the good news -I knew it! -I'll take your pomegranate paste, I'm making him Fesenjan What does this mean? He never got on the plane? He'll come and tell us himself Come here love for a second Come, sit her Look when you were downstairs did your landline ring? -No -Has anyone called the entire day? -No -Wasn't your mum on the phone to Hamid? -Is there something wrong auntie? -No love nothing has happened Didn't your brother called to talk to your mum today? It's Forough! How dare you! Take it all away! Go away I didn't come here unplanned -Who told you to bring this? -Go inside -Go inside -I don't want someone to make decisions for me -Take all of this away sir -Fine pay me so I can go -I don't know how much it is, Mojtaba does -There he is It's all Mojtaba's fault He asked me to bring all this They're leaving love He's leaving Leave sir Get inside Haji Mehdi what do you think we should do now? We'll wait a few more days Dad I checked their phone there was no call. Hamid's phone is still of too -Maybe his number just wasn't there -What do you mean? He's in hiding just when this plane has crashed? We've known Hamid all our lives when has he ever done this before? God help her You're in the right place God so why do this? First her husband Heydar who was fine one minute, dropped dead the next -Now this kids -It's life It has its ups and downs You can't trust anything It's a breeze for one And for someone like Hamid it turns into storm Love each other whilst you have time Nothing is worth fighting for Life is too unfaithful Are you upset with me? Parents will never be too upset with their kids Mum I'm not crazy to want to wind you up What should I do? I'm different I'm not like Fatemeh I just want what's best for all of you The moon is hiding behind the clouds There are so many secrets in this world What's your secret mum? -Are you still in a mood? -No what mood? -Then what's your secret? -It won't be a secret if I do You remember she used to trick us into telling our secrets? I still say if you do, you'll feel much lighter You'll fly like these pigeons Mum? Have you ever been in love? -You're so rude -What's wrong with it? Then why do you get tears in your eyes when we talk about your cousin Masoud? Because he was martyred Your cousin Ahmad was also martyred But you only do that with your other cousin -Leave her alone -What's it to you? It's so cool that these birds find their way home at night Mum you can't take this off anymore What horrible days! They're like a nightmare They'll pass. We've seen worse days When the bomb was hit a metre away from me, no one thought I'd survive I was in a coma for a year Your dad was next to me everyday for a year It was God's help that I came back Now have faith in God -You think Hamid will be back? -I have hope love My dad is home I can't talk You don't get it -What should I do? -Mohadeseh it's starting to rain It'll all get wet Nasibeh get up Let's pack these up Take them quickly before they get wet -Dad get up -Get up, you'll get wet Dad Dad It's raining dad get up Dad? Get up dad! Get up Mum?
