- Regarding Mark and Jennifer Taylor, the state of Illinois confirms that your application for the legal adoption of Alison gene Brenner has been approved. - Does that mean? - Yeah. Oh, merry Christmas you two. Oh, you are officially parents. - Thank you Annie for everything. Can't I tell you how grateful we are. - I think we convinced ourselves that it just wasn't meant to be. And what you managed to do for us. - So happy for you both. Now go home, celebrate, you deserve it. - Thank you. - Congratulations. ♪ Making spirits bright ♪ ♪ what fun it is to laugh and sing ♪ ♪ a sleighing song tonight ♪ ♪ yeah what fun it is to laugh and sing ♪ ♪ a sleighing song tonight ♪ (Rock music) - Oh yeah. Now we're talking. ♪ Out of all the reindeer, you know you're the mastermind ♪ ♪ run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind ♪ ♪ run, run Rudolph ♪ What are you guys doing here? - We're on our way back from the cafe and heard the commotion and thought maybe you were? - Being danced to death? - I told you mother the knock first. - Thank you, dad. - You said open door policy. - Yeah, open door policy doesn't mean walk through the door policy. What if I was... - Dancing with your dog wearing your Christmas pajamas? - Yeah. - We're happy you're safe and now we're leaving. - Thank you. See you in the morning. (Bouncy music) - [Pat] Those two must be thrilled. They have been trying to adopt for years. - I remember those days sitting by the phone, wondering if we'd ever get the call. - It's heart wrenching. And then one day, there you were. - Just a perfect little angel. - Yes who liked to stay up all hours of the night performing dance routines for her dolls. - And drawing murals with her mother's lipstick on the living room walls. - [Annie] Are you saying that it was difficult? - Not at all. You were just you. - Okay. - And we loved every single second of it. - Gene, the back stove's doing that thing again with the smoke. One of these days, it's going to set off the fire sprinklers and then, pshh, and I'm not cleaning it up. - Thank you, Helen. I'll have a look. - Okay, wow. These look so good. Chelsea, beautiful. I love the colors. - Thanks. - Need a jelly bean refill? Dad, jelly bean emergency. Okay. And maybe these. (Slow intense music) When were you gonna tell me about this? - We wanted to wait until after the holidays. We didn't wanna spoil your Christmas. - We knew you'd be... - What, upset, devastated? How was this even possible? - The owners have wanted to tear this building down and redevelop it for years. - This cafe is your life. I was practically raised here with half the neighborhood. I mean, how can they do this? This is our home. - Annie, where as upset as you are. - It doesn't really seem like it. - We've just had a little more time to digest it. Our hands are tied. - We've tried to negotiate. They will not renew the lease. - No, first it was sunrise books, then it was the deli, Mary's is shutting down, half the stores on this block are vacant. This Holt enterprises, they just picked a fight with the wrong family. And I'm about to show them right now. - Annie. - What? - Pants. - Right. ("Deck the halls") - Meeting with the sales team at two and a call at three. We've already pushed that once, so I think we should really make sure that we... - Bah! (Laughs) You sure you don't want in on this? I'll give you a 10 point lead. - How about 10 minutes of your time to go over the new bylaws from the city planning commission? - [Jim] William. - And when you get a sec, let's go over the new bylaws from the city planning commission. - Took the words right out of my mouth. - Dad looking sharp, new haircut? - No, you missed the investor meeting for the waterfront proposal on Friday. - For what it's worth, I did make it to my afternoon drinks meeting. As for a proposal, not really sure she's the one. Come on, the deal's gonna close. And even if it doesn't, does Chicago really need another faceless glass office tower? I'm kidding. - Will, we face two lawsuits this year because of your carelessness. And now, this complaint from the preservation society. - Oh, the complaint from the preservation society is... - A sign that you're not paying enough attention to your job. Enough is enough. Now you start to show some real leadership and commitment or when it comes time for me to step aside from this company, I'll sell it. - You wouldn't. - In the meantime, I've arranged for general counsel to work alongside you directly so that we can avoid more of these costly legal oversights. In fact, the candidates are waiting right out of the hall as we speak. - So you're hiring me a babysitter. - No, of course not. I'm expecting you to. Now you can get back to your, your game. Lyle. - Mr. Holt. - Someone to watch my every move? That's what I got you for. - That's what I do, but it's not actually what I'm for. And I can't do the legal stuff. - How bad is it out there? - [Lyle] It's pretty bad. - Yip, that's pretty bad. - Yeah. Where are you going? - I don't know. Grab a coffee and then direct flight to The Bahamas. - Will. - Lyle, I'm not a child. I don't need a chaperone. What I need is a minute to figure this out. (Festive music) - Mr. Holt? - Grabbing a coffee, I'll send a postcard. - Mr. Holt, i'm Annie park, i'm... - I know what you are, fine. Let's get this over with. - Get one over with? - Please, I know why you're here. You're some hot shot lawyer and you're here to tell me, do this, don't do that. - I don't know about hot shot. I mean, I am pretty good. Wait, how do you know that I'm a lawyer? - Look, I'll listen to your pitch, but this is not a done deal. I still get the final say, are we clear? - No, not really. Listen, if I could just have... - Sorry, single occupancy. - What? Mr. Holt. - [Will] Wow, you don't quit. - [Annie] Listen, I'm not just a... - [Will] Lawyer, I get it. Advisor, counselor, play squash? - No. - Oh, that's too bad. You definitely have the reach for it. - [Annie] Listen, Mr. Holt, if you could just give me two minutes, I think you would... - All right, sell me. What do you got? - Sell you? Okay, the starlight. Cute little cafe on 5th and broad, voted best waffles in the city 14 years in a row. Well, technically 13, but that was only because they left the category off there. Anyway, you can't tear it down. I mean you could, I live in that part of town, Mr. Holt. These people, they are tired of being pushed around and pushed out and this cafe, it is the heartbeat of the community. If you take it away, there will be a revolt. - Wow, that was a lot of words. What firm did you say you're from? - I didn't. Annie park: Family law. - Family law, why would you want to work at a place like Holt enterprises? - Why would anyone wanna work at Holt enterprises? - You're not here for a job? - No, you're tearing down my parents' cafe. I came to tell you... - Will, will, what on earth are you doing here? You've got a half a dozen lawyers waiting for you up in the, who's this? - This is, this is Allie. - Annie. - Annie. She's a lawyer. She's a good one, very good. A lot of passionate things to say about our company. Anyway, we're gonna keep chatting here. So thanks for checking in. I'll let you know how it goes. - So like I said... - Work of me. - What? - Work for me. My father, that very serious man just there thinks that I need a lawyer looking after me full-time and I happen think differently. You wouldn't have to do any actual legal work. You just have to shadow me and you know, look like a lawyer. Yeah, like that. - I wouldn't work for you for a million dollars. - How about two? - Really? - No, no. Actually I wasn't gonna pay you anything. - Then why would I do it? - Because you need my help saving your little bakery or. - Cafe. - Even better, I love coffee. - You want me to pretend to be your lawyer until? - Christmas, I'll figure it out beyond that. - And then you'll save my parents' cafe? Why would I trust you? - I'm a man of my word. Is that a yes? - I. - Great, I'll see you at 8:00 A.M. Thank you. Oh, and a, wear business attire. (Festive music) - [Pat] Hey, so what happened? What'd they say? - Ah, well it was strange actually. He offered me a job. - A job? - Well, not a real job. I just have to do it for a week. - So you took it? - Do exactly what for a week? - Pretend to be his lawyer. - You are a lawyer. - No, I know. Not that kind of a lawyer, like a different kind of lawyer. - A different kind, wait, look, I am so confused. - He's having some kind of an issue with his dad. He needs me to play his lawyer for a week and in return he's agreed to save the starlight. I know it's insane, but it's all we have right now. So game on. (Slow lively music) - Punctual, I like that. - Let me just start by saying, I think this whole thing is insane. And before I lift a finger, I just need you to, I need... - Hold that thought. - Proofs for the ribbon cutting photo boards. You need to choose one. - Great, Lyle, Annie, Annie, Lyle. Lyle's my, what's your official title? - I don't have one. But man we duties include personal assistants, life coach, style consultant and generally being younger, smarter and better looking. - Younger maybe. I don't know, rugged and charming or career focused but emotionally available and charming. Either, they're identical - hmm. In that one, your right eyelid is tensed. Makes you look like you're hiding something, which let's be honest, you probably are, but that's not necessarily something you wanna broadcast. - The less sketchy one it is. We're leaving. - Oh right. So, where are we going? - You've heard of the sphl? - Society for preservation of historical landmarks, of course. - Well they're threatening to sue me. - For what? - I don't know, historical bush or something. - A historical bush? - Apparently we built a parking garage on top of it. - What? Oh, they should be suing you for a lot and you need a lawyer in there who specializes in business law. - Nah, these people are harmless. I'll just give them a little bit of the old Holt razzle and dazzle. - I can't believe he just said that. Whatever, I'm not even gonna talk in there. - Probably for the best. - It wasn't just a bush. That bonsai tree was a gift from the Japanese prime minister as a symbol of peace after the war. The tree was almost 400 years old. - You're upset understandably and I apologize. But let's be honest, 400 years is a pretty decent life. - I think what Mr. Holt means is that he understands the importance of protecting and preserving the rich legacies of our communities and in effort to make this right, he is hosting a Christmas fundraising gala where all of the proceeds are gonna go directly to your foundation and holt enterprises is going to match those donations dollar for dollar. (Lively music) - What happened to letting me do the talking? - Oh, and how is that going? Didn't really seem like they were feeling the razzle or the dazzle. - Oh I can't wait to hear what my father has to say about this. - Probably something like, brilliant idea, Annie. You're the best lawyer William has ever pretended to hire. (Intense bouncy music) - Just drive. - A Christmas fundraiser in one week's time and this was your idea? And from a legal standpoint? Smart, brilliant actually. The lawsuit goes away at relatively little cost and the press eats it up. It'll have to be done properly though. There'll be a lot of eyes on us. - Great, I'll put a team on it. - Actually will, no. I think I'd like you on this personally. Big responsibility, high profile, lots of moving parts. - Dad. - Sort of like running a company. Where will you hold it? Might be near impossible to find a prime venue this late in the game. - We already have it, the starlight. - Yeah, it's perfect. Only the best. - That's right. - Okay. - Well, I think that went well. - Which part, the part where I went from managing half a billion dollars in real estate development to planning a Christmas party? - Fundraiser and I think you're gonna have fun with this. - Oh no, no, no, no. I already have a job. This is all you. - I have no idea how to plan a fundraiser. - Well, maybe you shouldn't be running around handing out like party favors. - Deal, I will plan your fundraiser. - Your fundraiser. - And I will pull this off. And when I do, you have to promise to renew the lease on my parents' cafe. Say the words. - The cafe is saved. - Well, I better get to... - No. We're needing a conference from three. You're still my lawyer for the week. That was the agreement. Hustle up. (Festive music) - Jelly beans. Annie, jelly beans. - Oh, sorry. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just thinking about the fundraiser. - Yeah, it's a lot the whole thing. And I know you wanna throw yourself headlong into this. - Dad, I've got it. - It's not you i'm concerned about. This is a big corporation with lots of money involved and I just hope your expectations are realistic. - Have you met me? - I'll never forget when you first took up ice skating. - Oh here we go. - You were cute as a button, but man, oh man. - You were hopeless. You could barely stand, yet you made us buy you skates that were three sizes too big. - You were determined by the time you grew into them, that you'd be able to do a proper twirl. - And I did, didn't I? Landed the first one. - Well, the first one you landed on your backside. The second time you were close but by the third time, you were flying. - By the skates, land the twirl. - You've always had this amazing ability to accomplish whatever you set in your mind. - We're here for you, honey. Do you need anything? - There is one little thing. This is beautiful by the way. I said we would host it at the starlight. - Fine with us. - Great. (Festive music) - Christmas trees? - Yep. - Okay, well, I have a meeting downtown in 45 minutes. - And I have an event plan that I have no idea how to plan and all I know is we need a big, beautiful Christmas tree. So here we are. Buy the skates, land the twirl. - What? - If you build it, they will come. - Oh I see, so you think if you buy a Christmas tree, the rest of the party will magically just fall into place. - Girl can dream. This doesn't remind you of when you were a kid? - Honestly no. - You never picked a Christmas tree? - I mean we had one, but I didn't set it up. I would get home from school one day and there it was. - Even decorations? - Christmas was more of a look but don't touch holiday in our house. Dad always hire people for that. Probably afraid I would mess it up. And let's be honest, he was probably right. - In that case, a lesson in the art of picking Christmas trees. - Okay. - There are three main criteria. - Oh. - One color, fullness, smell. - Okay. - Come on, try it. Okay, that was pathetic. You gotta get in there. Like really get in there. - All right. Oh! (Crash) (Laughs) - [Will] Oh, that's funny. Oh, you enjoying yourself? - I'm sorry. - Now there's nearly 600,000 square feet of usable ground-level on this block. Are you thinking commercial, residential? - Actually we're considering more of a high-end outdoor shopping experience. (Disproving scoff) - Walk me through the limitations if we wanna go vertical depending on the city zoning bylaws when we actually consider adding tower to the project. (Bell rings) What are we doing in here? - What do you think? - Cute, it might be a little snug on you though. - Not for me, for Charles. - Your baby? - No. - Miniature boyfriend? - No, my dog. - Charles, after the prince? - Charles after Charles dickens. I read "great expectations" in the 9th grade and it destroyed me. - I loved her against promise, against reason, against hope, against all discouragement that could be. You scoffed when I mentioned the shopping mall, why? - Oh am I allowed to talk? I don't know. Just seems a little tone deaf. Cost of living is already high, people are already struggling. You put a mall across the street and all of these shops along this strip go out of business, including this one. And that's on you. (Calm music) - I'd go with a Santa suit. - I'm gonna go with both. - Appreciate you sitting down with me, Ted. You're a tough guy to get an audience with. - [Ted] Well, there's lots of people lined up hoping to get in business with me. - I'd be lying if I said I wasn't one of them. - [Ted] I'm familiar with your company. Mainly commercial, high rise, residential, that sort of thing. - Among other things. Actually, we just looked at a big lot in norwood park area I think you might be... - Well as long as it's not a hotel or a shopping mall or something. The last thing the city needs is another one of those. - Agree. No, the property we're looking at developing is... - Everything all right over there? - Yeah, fine ,yeah. It's just the menu's all in French. - It's a French restaurant. - I realized that. I just don't know what any of this, this frencheses. - Nobody does. (Laughs) - It's okay, I'll just bring the usual. - Oh no. - [Will] Please. - Wow. What is this? - It's fois gras. Duck liver. (Bouncy music) - Any chance you get one of those for me? Thank you. - Okay, I gotta show you this one. You're gonna. - Okay, okay. - Look, look at him in his little pjs. - [Ted] This is Charlie? - Yeah. - Awe, and a terrier to boot, you're kidding me. - Yeah. - Well my gigi and I have three of them, all rescues as well. - No, get outta here. - He has three of them. - Yeah, you get out of her. - Can you believe that? Wait, you are. - What, what? - He's gonna. Wait for it. - What? - Get out of here. Well, that's just about the cutest darn thing I've ever seen. - I know. It's yours. - Oh no, no, no, no, - yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no. - I couldn't. - You take it. - No, I couldn't. - Yes, it's yours. You keep it. - Are you sure? - Yes, yes. - Well, gigi's gonna flip out. You two would get along like gangbusters. You know, we're having a little Christmas party at the house Friday evening. I'd be honored if you join us. You have got to come. - I would love to, thank you. Well, maybe will could come. I have been talking your ear off this entire lunch and will hear, he's got some great ideas that he'd love to pass by you. - Well sure, why not? - I mean. - Always time to chat a little business. - There you go. He's so nice. - Well, he sure took a shine to you. Course here I am peddling the same corporate. - Oh, tree got delivered to the office. - The office? - Yeah, they weren't ready for it at the starlight, so I had it delivered to the office. - Whose office? - [Annie] What are we missing? - I don't know. Kind of hard to see with the giant tree in the way. - Oh relax, it's not that big. - Whoa, big tree. Noble spruce, king of the conifers, nice. - Did you need something, Lyle? - Not really. Heard there was a tree in here and wanted to see for myself. Do we all get one next year? - Lyle. - Fine, actually yes. All the invitations have gone out and I already have a number of rsvps. - Great, that's really great. We officially have people coming to a fundraiser which now solely consists of a Christmas tree. - Well, buy the skates, land the twirl. - [Annie] Where are you going? - Oh, I have drinks. - Drinks right now? - Did you need something? - No. - Great, I'll see you tomorrow at the ribbon cutting. You have Lyle if you need anything. - You're gonna need photographer, music, hosting stuff, gift bags, oh and a theme. Every great party has a theme. - A theme. (Slow festive music) - And any day we get to celebrate the opening of a new building is a great day for holt enterprises. And I'm sure there are warmer places you would all like to be. So I'll keep it at that. Let's get this ribbon cut and get the show on the road. (Applause) - It's an impressive building. How many mom and pop shops did you have to tear down to build that one? - None, it was an orphanage. You really think i'm that big a monster? - You really want me to answer that? - You know, I don't wake up in the morning and think, boy, today I'd really like to build a 55 story office tower. - No, you're more of a luxury resort kind of guy. Do you need me anymore today? - Not specifically. Got somewhere to be? Yeah, I've got an errand I'd like to run. Actually, it's not far from here. I can take a cab. - No, no, no, no, don't be silly. We'll drive you. (Lively music) Buckle up. Toy store? We're planning a fundraiser, not a kids party. - I need a theme. - I though Christmas was the theme. - Christmas is the season. The theme is going to make the night memorable. I just don't know what it is yet. - I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little impresses. - Christmas didn't even start in our house until we'd been to Conrad's. This doesn't bring out the kid in you, then we need to have your heart check. Wait, you do have a heart? - No way, is this free? Chocolate or strawberry? Wait, I know this one. - You will refuse the granola bar because it's not organic, but you will eat ice cream that's meant for children before lunch? - Ice cream is for anyone, at any time, at any place. - Anything but vanilla. ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ - Thank you. - Thank you. - So you come here every year? - At least once the first time was when I was four. - And you still remember it? - Like it was yesterday. It was with my parents, my new parents. I was adopted a couple of weeks before Christmas. Sort of became a tradition ever since. - Wow. Really regretting that orphanage comment from earlier. - Yeah. They also said I could pick out anything I wanted that year. - Man, it's not an experience I ever got. My dad's secretary did all the shopping. Tell me you went with giant plastic elephant. - Real one. - Really? - No. Wow. (Laughs) It was just a simple snow globe. But when I saw it, I knew that I had to have. It was one of those things that, you know you just felt like it had always belonged to you. It's a little Christmas magic. - Why not that for the theme, Christmas magic? - Christmas magic. It's all the things that transport you to a world where anything is possible. Yes, I like it. There's hope for you yet, William holt. - You feel like grabbing some lunch? - Yeah, but I get to pick the place this time. (Lively music) See, this is how normal people eat. - Oh, I've seen the commercials. You know, I actually went to private school not too far from here. - I can picture you in high school. - Oh, do tell. Super popular, captain of the whatever team, definitely prom king, definitely. - Is that what you think? - Well, yeah that's the story you give off. Am I wrong? - Okay, no one has ever seen this, ever, aside from Lyle who i'm pretty sure stole a copy in case he needed a blackmail me one day. I give you William holt, heartbreaker. Definitely not prom king. I didn't even go. - That's you? - That's me. - No. I mean, he's cute, you're cute. Nerdy definitely, but cute. - Okay, show me yours. - No. - Come on, come on. - No, nobody gets to see that. Nobody, not the grad photo. Okay, I'm sure I have something else, something. - Give me the goods. - It's only fair. - Okay. - [Annie] Oh yeah, there it is. - Were you an administrative assistant to a circus company? (Laughs) - No, it was figure skating and I took it very seriously. - I can tell. - I mean I tried. Yeah, I. - It's very charming. You've come a long way. - So have you. Hard to believe that that guy has been hiding out inside there all this time. - Yeah. (Slow festive music) - The magic of Christmas. That's perfect. Well, of course it is. It's you were talking about. - Well, actually that one wasn't me at all. That was will. Yep, his one contribution to this entire thing. At least it was a good one. - Well it sure sounds like the two of you are getting along well. - Is this the guy? - Yep. - Whoa, handsome. - Annie. Oh my gosh, he looks like a charmer, doesn't he? - All right, all right, - look at his jaw. - Blue eyes. - Anyway the fundraiser, hi, it's coming along well. Got the photographer booked, the music is all set. - What about food? - Food. Food, how did I forget about the food? I just figured because we were a restaurant, I didn't even think about the food. I knew that we would have it here. - Annie, we make breakfast. I mean, we can handle the desserts but. - What am I gonna do? What am I going to serve for dinner? - Not waffles. - Thank you, Helen. (Festive music) Lyle, where's will? - It's Friday. He plays squash with his father on Fridays. - Well of course he does. Yeah, why would he fill me in on that? You know, why am I even here? It's not like I have a fundraiser to plan in four days time and every time I try to make a decision, you know I tumble head forward into a rabbit hole full of bigger and bigger problems threatening to choke the life right out of me. - Okay, you're coming with me. - Lyle, sorry, I don't have time for this. - Annie, trust me. You don't have a choice. Come on, we're leaving. (Bouncy music) No caterer? - I know. - [Lyle] It's $1000 a plate dinner. - Yeah I know. - The dinner part is right in the name. - I don't know, I don't do this thing. I'm not thrilled with myself either. - Oh um, the Dalai Lama? - Close enough. - Hi. - Michael, you must be Annie. - Yes, nice to meet you. - Perfect timing, she needs your help. This man could write his own food blog. Can't cook to save his life, but he knows all about it. - How can I be of service? - Oh, it's fine. Thank you, that's very kind. It's just, I'm fine. I need a caterer like yesterday. What do you even serve at $1000 dollar a plate fundraiser? - It could be whatever you want. What kind of things do you like to eat? - Sliders, Mac and cheese, chicken fingers. - For Chicago's wealthiest elite, not a children's birthday party. - I know. - Let's try this. What would will approve of? - Golden crested deck liver. I don't know, I'd ask him, but he's playing squash with his father. Who knows what he wants. He has the whole world in front of him on a silver platter and half the time, he acts like he wants to tip it over. - Sometimes when people feel pushed or boxed in, they do things that seem wildly out of reason. - Boxed into what? Being handed a billion dollar corporation? - That's what his father wants, but it's that what he wants? I think if you look beyond the fois gras and the tailored suits, you'll find that he's really just chicken finger guy at heart. - Being married to a psychologist has the occasional upside. - Speaking of, that little Italian place that will sent us to on our anniversary, is just down the street, yeah? - Yeah. - I'm sure the cater. - Then it's will approve. - It's worth the shot. - Yeah - awe, that was great gentlemen, thank you. We will be in touch. - See you. - Okay, thanks. (Laughs) - Yes and he tripped right into it and I was just like right under the table. It was the worst thing that I ever, I'm not, I'm not even. - Looks like I missed a party. - Hi, hi, yeah. Well we just, we had a lunch thing and then it turned into a food tasting thing. - Oh then it turned into a buffet. I think I had 30 of those little ravioli things. - With the truffles? I know, I should've pocketed some for later. - You should have. - That's okay, I'm smart, I did. Thank you so much for your help, Michael. - So glad we got the catering sorted. - [Annie] Oh me too, thank you. - I'll see you again soon. - Okay, yes. Bye. - Bye-bye. - Well, it's like you had a productive morning. You know, my afternoon is actually pretty open if you need anything. - Nope, I think i'm all good, thanks. - Good. - Will you be my services at all this afternoon? - No, no, I don't think so. - Okay, well I guess I'll see you at Ted's Christmas party. - Yes, okay. - Okay. - Oh, dress code? - It's a Christmas party, casual. - Casual, casual, okay. (Lively festive music) - Hi. - Hi. - You look. No, no, no. What is this, what is this sweater? - What do you mean what is this sweater? You said casual. - I said casual, I meant like, you know, nice casual, not bingo night at the legion. - Well, there you are. Welcome, come on in. I'm so glad you came. - Well, thank you so much for having us. - May I take your coats? - Yep. - Annie? - Oh no, that's okay. It's cold outside and I don't wanna cause you any trouble. - Oh it's no trouble at all. Besides, it tends to get a little warm in here. - Yep. - Gigi, this is Annie I was telling you about. - Oh my. - I know he said it was casual so... - I have the exact same sweater. I haven't worn it years. Ted, we have to dig those out tonight. I have a whole trunk full, how fun. Let me introduce you to everyone. Starting with Karlie. - Oh, the Santa suit. Hello Karlie. - That's Karlie. - Look at the Santa suit. - Love the Santa suit. - [Ted] This way son. (People chatting) ♪ The angel did sing ♪ - Ted tells me you're working on some sort of fund raiser. Anything we can do to help? - Oh, I think we have it. Yeah, I mean I'm not so sure about the fundraising parts, but. - Well that's the easy part. Leave that to me. I'll sell some plates for you. Beg pardon, I'd just grab your attention for one second. My friend Annie here is hosting a fundraiser for the preservation society this Tuesday evening. I would consider it a personal favor if each and every one of you would joined gigi and I in attending. - Ah, I wondered why it felt like all the life had left the party. Here you are standing outside. What's up? - Yip, tiny, teensy problem. It was really nice of Ted to invite all those people, but. - [Will] But? - Well, the starlight cafe only holds 95 Max and we're already at that limit, so. - 95 what? 95 tables? - No will, people. And there were at least another 50 of them here at the party. It's a cafe, it's not Madison square garden. - Are you serious right now? Goodnight, we'll see you on Tuesday. Do you have any idea how bad this is gonna look? - Well, not as bad as you almost tearing down a building you clearly know nothing about. - We can't just go inside and uninvite everybody. - Hi. - Hi, it's very nice to meet you. What are we gonna do? - We aren't gonna do anything, all right? This is a me thing, will. So you can go back to your drinks and your squash and whatever it is you do to remain blissfully unaware because that's what you do. It's nothing to you. This is a game, but it's not to me, will. This is my life, this is my family, this is my history. So I am gonna go home and try to fix this because that's what I do, that's who I am. The only person I can trust to show up for me is me and I'm okay with that. (Sad music) Oh and the sweater, it's a big hit. (Bouncy music) (Calm music) (Crash) Will, what are you doing? - I was just coming down the walk and I didn't see... - No, what are you doing here? It's Saturday morning. I'm sure you didn't come to shovel my walk. - No. Truth is last night, you said some things to me that weren't entirely flattering. And while I don't agree with some of them, you did make a few comments that had some truth. - Will. - I wanna help. (Crash) - [Pat] Annie, what's going on down there? - It's just a friend, mom. - Mom? - Hi. Do you two wanna come up? We had just made breakfast if you're hungry. - Oh no, he can't. - I would love that. More waffles? - No, thank you. - All right. - What brings you out this way on a Saturday morning, will? - Well gene, your daughter and I find ourselves in a bit of a pickle. - So we here. - I wanna help. These are unbelievable, what do you put in here? - Oh, it's an old family secret. I could tell you, but then I'd have a to... - Agave, is it agave syrup? Uh-oh, does that mean you still have to? 'Cause I do not wanna be buried in these shoes. (Laughs) - You are right, he is so charming. - Mom, I did not say that. - You said he was handsome and charming. - No, I didn't. Helen said he was handsome. - Oh, I like Helen. - And then you said charming. - You said he was charming. I didn't say anything. I definitely didn't say you were charming. - What else did you definitely not say? - Will, this has been fun. I have a crisis to handle. So I am gonna go to the starlight. Will, thank you so much for this unannounced visit and I'll talk to you tomorrow or the next day or maybe never. - I'll come with you. - I'm okay, that's fine. - Why, I wanna help? - Why not, he can come. - He wants to help, let him come. - Fine, I'm gonna go get dressed. Will, just don't anything. - She's always been... - Fiercely independent. - Yeah, ever since she was little. - Likes to handle things herself. But when she says she's gonna do something. - She had full well is going to get that thing done. - Boy, you better not get in the away. - 95 people, even that feels like a stretch. Unless you're gonna put some of them on the roof. Is that the plan, you're gonna put a few of them on the roof? - Okay will, I am literally this close. (Calm music) - That you on the horse? - Yeah. - A lot of history here. You know this place, it's not what I thought it would be in a good way. - I know. - And the toy drive, is that all you? - Yeah, it's something we do every Christmas. Sometimes even just an extra present or two under the Christmas tree helps. - Thoughts, ideas, solutions? Rent an excavator, blow out some walls, save you some trouble down the road. - I don't know, I don't see how we can do it here. There's gotta be somewhere close. Maybe we go to the high school gymnasium. - Bow ties and ballgowns and a giant box just smells like sweat. - It sounds like my prom. - Maybe it's for the best I didn't go. - Maybe we put them all into the bookstore. - That's actually not a half bad idea. This whole building used to be one big general store. Shortly after the second world war right before my family opened the cafe, it was divided in half. This other half became sunrise books. - Dad, I was just kidding. The bookstore has been closed for years. - [Will] Why did it shut down? - I don't know, you'll have to ask the guy who owns the building. - [Gene] All right. (Door scrapes) - Perfect. Nothing to it. Okay, we've got Marco's moving truck confirmed, a bunch of volunteers, tomorrow might not be impossible. - Well I can get Carl to help out. - Oh, that's good. - No, not so much in a commercial application because on a house like this, the overhang, you paying attention? You writing this down? Is of particular importance because if the snow slides off when you're walking out the door, you get hit in the head with snow, suddenly your whole day is ruined. - Expected him to be a little more, I dunno, shark like. I don't love that he's ripping marshmallows off the gingerbread village, but over all, he seems like a pretty decent guy. - That's pretty good, watch this. Oh, you like that one? - Will, thank you so much for your help today. I think we can... - Are you sticking around for the show tonight? Live music, only happens once a year at Christmas time. - He's busy, you're busy. - I'm wide open. I'd love to. - Great, we'll see you at seven. - All right, see you then, gene. Well, that sounds fun. - Okay. Well I'm gonna go home and change and feed Charles, so. - You mind if I tag along? I feel like I kind of just be getting in the way here. - I. - Great. - Maybe you should just hang back here. Sometimes he's skittish new people and I don't want to... - Who, this guy? Nah, he's not skittish. He's a good boy. - Okay, I'll just go. - Oh, he's a good boy. He loves it when you scratch his belly. - Okay. - Oh, look at that face. That's pure love right there. Oh yeah. You got lucky with that one, pal. She's one of the good ones. You know that, right? (Charles whines) All right, don't need to shout. What do yous say, feel like giving me the tour? (Charles barks) (Calm music) - So. - You look nice. - I just threw on whatever was dirty, wasn't dirty. (Bouncy music) - Is this the? - Yeah, that's it. - Mind if I? - Sure. It's the crushed pearls that make it shimmer like that. - It's beautiful. - It used to have a key that in the back here that you would wind it up with and she'd sort of twirl in the snow. - What happened to it? - Not really sure. I used to wear the key on a chain around my neck and one day I looked down and it was gone. I cried for days. My dad looked everywhere for it. I'm not sure who was more disappointed, him or me. It's been a long time since she's danced. Well, I will go feed Charles and then we should probably head back over there because we don't wanna miss the show. - Hey everyone. It is so special for me to be here at starlight Christmas. I remember the first time that had ever written a song, I performed it here and I was 10 years old and I was so nervous. But knowing that there'd be waffles back there waiting for me after, it reminded me that everything was gonna be okay. This song is one of my favorites and I hope you enjoy it.

I just hope that you can or they at least you've thought about how you can hold up your end of it. I just don't wanna see you get hurt, that's all. - Yeah. - Good, good. I'm gonna grab a plate. - Great, grab a bag as well. (Bag crinkles) - Okay. (Phone rings) - Hi. Yes, thank you so much for calling me back. They canceled. - Who? - The caterers. They literally just canceled. I called them to tell them there are gonna be more people and they said they couldn't accommodate. - Wow. What? It's delicious. - Oh I let the meat soak 'em in. - Hi Eddie. - Annie, it's good to see you. - It's good to se you. Do you cater? - Not usually, but for you, I could bend the rules a little bit. - For how many? - 100 give or take. - I've done 100 before, but not with all the truck. - Are you free Tuesday? - Free as a bird. (Laughs) - Hi, sorry. Are you actually suggesting we serve our guests rib made from a trailer idling outside of the curve? No offense. - Yeah. I am and I'm gonna park it out front and feed them from there. Any objections? - Nice. - Good. Consider yourself booked. Problem solved. - Done and done. You gotta try some of this, bro. - All right. Hard to believe we got all that done in one day. - That is the power of community. Well, I should get back and take care of some of these, the details. - Or actually I know this little place that's not too far from here. It's pretty cool. We could check it out? - You know a place? - Why, you got somewhere to be? - No, but I mean, I. - But, but, come on. It's okay to color outside the lines once in a while. It'll be fun, trust me. (Giggles) Good, let's go. I'm driving. - All right. Okay. - All right, watch your step. - [Annie] Where are we? Feels like the north pole. - All right, easy. - Okay. - [Will] Okay. Can I open them? - Yeah. (Light boom) ("Joy to the world") - Oh. - Said you liked figure skating. So. - Wow. Oh my, look at this, - it's what I thought. - [Annie] Oh my. (Calm music) - [Will] Ready to show me how it's done? - Okay, well, full disclosure, it's been a while. Like a long while. - Okay. ♪ Holy night ♪ - Wow, all right, all right. Whoa! Nope, nope. - You own an ice skating rink and you don't know how to skate. - I own a pulp mill, don't know how to make paper either. So what's your move, hot shot? - I don't have to move. - Oh, come on. I know you have a move. - I don't know have a move. - What's your move, what's your move? What was your finisher? - Okay, fine. I have a move, but I need a partner and. You? - Try me. I'm a quick study. - Okay. All right. Here, put your hands on my waist. I'm gonna count back from three and when I do, you are gonna lift me. - What? - Yeah. Ready, don't drop me. Promise? - Okay, yeah. - Okay, three, two, one. (Laughs) - I wrecked your move. - Did the trick. (Calm music) Thank you, that was unexpected. I just have to grab a few things and I'm okay to walk. - Are you hungry? I don't think I've eaten all day. - Yeah. I know a place, and he cooks. - I may not be able to ice skate to save my life, but I whip up a pretty average grilled cheese sandwich. - Thank you, it's perfect. - Not bad. - Pretty good. - On the off chance that I haven't said this yet, you've done an incredible job this week. I'm serious. I think we both know that if I was planning this fundraiser, it would just be a bowl pretzels and a couple of folding tables. You know, if the law thing ever falls through. - Oh yeah. I we'll keep that in mind. - I bet you will. - I am pretty happy where I am though. - Was that always the plan, family law? - Law was. Yeah, I always knew that I wanted to help people. Family law seemed like a natural fit, especially through adoption. I mean, it can be a tough process but it's really rewarding. - And you were four when you were adopted? - Yeah, yup. You know it's strange, most things at that age are a blur, but that day, that day I remember like it was yesterday. So many mixed emotions. Was just really happy to have been chosen, driving home to my actual home and yet feeling like none of it was real. I'd spent so much time wanting that sense of security, that that feeling of home, I think it was hard for me to believe that it was actually happening. I always had this sinking feeling like it would all just go away in a single breath. - That's a lot for a four year old. That's a lot for anybody. - Yeah but at the same time, it gave me this feeling of gratitude for every day that I had with them after that. I think it's why I love Christmas so much. It brings me back to that time, you know? At the beginning of us, sort of brings us full circle, doesn't it? The magic of Christmas. - And how's that fear now, of all of it just slipping away? - Present. - It doesn't have to be. (Bouncy festive music) - So walk me through this again. You wanna take the two or so million dollars we spent developing this project and just what, throw it in the trash? We're already slated for it demolition. - I just feel we need to rethink our strategy. Dad, that cafe is an integral part of that neighborhood. - We already ran a local impact study. - I know, I know, but I've been there and I've seen it for myself. What Andy's parents have done with that cafe for that community... - Hold, hold on, who's Annie? - Annie, my lawyer. - And her parents have an interest in that cafe? Well, that sounds to me like a pretty serious conflict of interest. - It would be, but Annie is not my lawyer. She is a lawyer, but she specializes in family law. - Well then why is she working for our company? - She's not, technically. We, I made an agreement with her that she would shadow me until Christmas and appear as my lawyer so you would. - I get the gist. And in exchange for? - I said that I would take another look at the project. But dad, this is not about some agreement or some favor for a friend. - Who is planning this fundraiser? - Annie did a lot of the work initially, but I've been helping. I spent the entire day yesterday... - You've been helping with the project that I put you solely in charge of? - All right, I know it sounds bad. - No, it doesn't. In fact, it doesn't surprise me. Just sounds like the same old story. If you'll excuse me, I've gotta get back to work. I have a company to run. (Sad music) (Camera lens shutters) - Last night was special. (Gasps) Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, delete, delete, delete, delete, what did I just do? (Phone vibrates) - Bet you're happy to finally see that thing out the door. - Kind of got used to it. What? - Don't what me. What did you do? - I didn't do anything, that's the problem. And I don't think I can. (Calm music) - Hi. - Hi. I need to talk to you. - Me first. Okay. I know that at your house, Christmas time, it was sort of a look but don't touch holiday. But in mine, it was both. So I saved this tree for last. I thought maybe you'd like to help me decorate it. - Annie, I... - Will, I have waited all week to do this, please? Can you just, can you give this to me? - Yeah. - Okay. Open it. (Chuckles) - It's a snow globe. - Seemed only fitting. (Serene music) William holt is about to decorate his first Christmas tree. Really is a world where anything is possible. Go ahead, it doesn't have to be perfect - pressure. Ta-da. - How did that feel? - Pretty good. - Yeah, you wanna do another one? - I do. - Great, 'cause I have about 300. - Okay.

I'm dad, that's my job. And I'm sorry I didn't. - All of our beginnings, all of our memories, all of our traditions all of them are their dad and once it's gone, it's just. - I know. But what is it really? A roof, four walls. And if those walls come down, who we are and what we are doesn't disappear with them. It lives with us wherever we go, whatever we do. It's right here and no one can ever take that away from us. As far as I'm concerned, walls are pretty overrated. - No, they keep you safe. - They can, but if we're talking about what I think we're really talking about, they cause more harm than good. Anni, a heart that doesn't know pain also doesn't know love and all the wonderful things that come with it. We are so proud of you, honey.

Your entire life, you've had someone around to break your fall or to pick up the pieces for you. This time you don't, you're on your own, okay? So you need to dig deep and figure out how to fix this or that woman will never forgive you. And if that happens, I guarantee you'll never forgive yourself. - Lyle, bring me everything we have on the starlight, print and digital, please. (Dramatic lively music) Ted, hey, William holt. Listen. Yeah, no, it really was. Listen, I'd love to get your opinion on something actually. What do you know about historical designation? - Oh will look, I know we didn't get a, well, much of a chance to chat last night but I really have to hand it to you... - We're not tearing it down, the cafe. I filed a petition with the city to have it granted historical designation and I know it's a long shot but until that's formally reviewed, we are prohibited from any further development. - Son, listen to me. - No, dad, you can talk all you want about bottom lines, impact studies, none of it matters. It's people and communities. It's honoring their history and their legacies, not stepping on them to inflate our own. We could build 1000 shopping malls dad, and not have as much impact as that one little cafe. You wanted me to start showing leadership, here it is. I won't move forward with the starlight or any other project until we start putting the people first because dad that's what matters. Even if it costs me my future with the company. - What are you proposing? (Bouncy music) - Helen, Helen. I'm looking for Annie. - You have some nerve. This is William holt, the guy who's tearing this place down. - Yeah, she's right. I am William holt and wow, that's the first time in my life. I haven't been proud to admit that. A couple of weeks ago, I wouldn't have given a second thought to tearing in a place like this down, and that's what we do. But then I met a pretty extraordinary woman, your daughter who opened my eyes to some things. Among them, the importance of community, history and family. Thing is I'm an idiot. - You're right about that. - And I made a pretty big mess of things with this woman who, if I'm being honest, I probably don't deserve in the first place. She's the only person who ever truly saw me for me and thought that was enough. And I broke broke her trust. And I may never be able to repair that, but I can keep my word. This cafe will not be torn down ever. I promise you that. - Will. - Annie. - Okay. Did you meet all of that? Because I'm feeling a lot of things right now and I really wanna trust you I'm worried you might've just said that 'cause you think that that's what I wanna hear and I don't know why you would do that, but maybe you would do that. I don't know. And you know, I'm just terrified that you're not real and then all this could go away. Imagining a life without you in it, just it really makes me sad. - Wow. That was, was a lot of words. (Romantic music) (Upbeat music) - You weren't kidding. - You know I don't kid about food. - And Marco makes amazing piaya. You have to make it for her. - Oh stop it. - I think I have something here for someone and it's an Alison. - Wow, thank you. - [Annie] Merry Christmas. - [Alison's mother] Merry Christmas, let me see. - I love how the brick transitions right into the glass. - [Gene] Really tells the story of generations, truly inspired. - And it's something I expect to see a lot more next year when the will takes over the helm of the company. - Are you serious? - I am. After lengthy consultations with your legal counsel, we both agreed that you would make an extraordinary leader, if that's what you want. - On one condition. Lyle. - Yeah? - What's your official title? - Oh, don't have one. - How does chief operating officer sound? - I. - That's a yes. - [Jim] Son. - Thanks dad. - Now, if somebody could please tell me where I can find some of those amazing waffles that I keep hearing about? - Right this way. - Now it's your turn. - My turn? What is this? - It's a little something. (Paper rustles) My snow glob. Is that my? - The one you lost? No. (Laughs) I'm not that good, but it fits.
