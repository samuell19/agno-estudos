Choko, choko, choko! Chokolietta! Come on... hurry up and change. I don't want to! Summer, 2010 Giulietta. I'm sorry I can't bring you. Be good, okay? Hey, I'm loading the car! Okay. Did you know that Kiriko-chan has a broken heart? She's "grieving", she said. So, Giulietta... Be really nice to her, okay? Chiyoko. Why are you telling her that? Get going! 'Kay. Choko, choko! Chokolietta! Coming! You don't need the float, do you? I don't care! Do a banzai! Kiriko-chan, the house is in your hands. I'll bring back a mountain of souvenirs. Giulietta, listen to what Kiriko-chan says! - I'll be back! - See you then! Giulietta! Kiriko-chan! Bye bye! Bye bye! Off we go. To the road! Have a good trip! They're gone. What song is this? Yeah, what is it? What is this... It's just gone... what could it be? Could it be from Chiyoko's kindergarten swimming trip or something? - No way... I'm pretty sure we've known it longer. - Can't have. Really...? I'm hungry! What is there where we're going? - There's a... a something-or-other farm that's famous up there. - Really? Let's have a loo-- Choko, choko, choko. Chokolietta. It's okay now. You don't need to worry. There is nothing to be afraid of. Chokolietta. Giulietta. Chokolietta. Giulietta. Which is the dog, and which is the human? Which is which? Woof! Woof! Woof! Oh! Chokolietta, you've been a dog all along? Huh? Kiriko-chan... Yeeeees? Where is Mom? She was here with Giulietta, wasn't she? Giulietta is taking care of the house. Dad is sleeping in the other room. And Mom? Hold on... I need to get a doctor! I am Chokolietta and I am a dog. Woof. Woof. When her mom died in an accident, the 5-year-old Miyanaga Chiyoko gave up being human and became a dog. It was a curse from Heaven that her mom put on her to protect poor little Chiyoko. And it's a lie. I'm actually just a high school student. I cut my hair over the summer. I cut it short enough to shock everyone. Anybody would think I'm a boy. That's because I don't want to be a girl. A half-truth. I don't want to be a boy, either. Chokolietta To be honest, I don't even want to be human. Woof. Let's not forget how grateful we are, and face the world with a smile today! Pray. Bow. Be seated. It's spring time! This season can be rough on your hearts and minds. Be careful. Pass these back. It will beat you if you have such long faces. This sheet is for your career choices. We will have 1-on-1 interviews based on your answers. Here. You're all in your second year now. Don't take it lightly. This is your life. Think it through before you fill it out. I want to be a dog. The Spring Film I'm home, Giulietta. Miyanaga! You came back! I thought you gave this up. Hey, Mitsuhashi Tomo... We used to have a bunch of DVDs here, didn't we? Where did they go? They belonged to people who graduated last year, so... they probably took them home. Oh. Hello! It sure is quiet here now. Whoa, look at this fuzz cut you've got here! It feels so nice! Please don't do that. I'm glad to see you're alive, Chiyoko-chan. That haircut looks really great on you. You're the only one who would say that, Yuki-senpai. Am I? - How about a kiss, then? - I'm not doing that. - Can't we? - No. Come on, girls... stop playing and help me out. Bringing up club traditions now, though... We're the only ones left now that everyone else graduated, right? Our club will probably be shut down next year. So that's that... it shuts down. Yuki-senpai, that's cold. You'll make me cry like a newborn. But I'll be leaving the club pretty soon... What else can we do? I haven't given up on this yet. I will make sure to bring in some new members. That aside... that movie that we showed for the welcoming party last year. - Last year? - Yeah. Oh, that... the black-and-white one. "A stone by the side of the road still has a place in the world." That would be Federico Fellini's La Strada. I thought you'd know, Yuki-senpai! Do you know where it is? I looked for it, but it's just not here. Wasn't that Masaoka Masamune's style, the whole retro thing? Masamune-senpai, huh... He was always recording things but never finished a single project. He sure was quite the oddball. Are you Miyanaga Chiyoko? [the bells spell "Masaoka"] Come up. Come in. Grab the one you want. How long are you going to record me? I guess... forever? No? Do you remember me asking you to stop doing that before? I don't. Just kidding. I remember. You'd be the only one in some other world and never let me record. Yeah, I'm going home. Wait, I know what you want! Fellini! Right? Take it. Thanks. Miyanaga Chiyoko. You're as scary as ever. You like Fellini a lot, don't you? Not quite. My dog's name is Giulietta. She died recently, though. The dog was named Giulietta. After Giulietta Masina? Probably. There's no way to make sure, though. Why not? My mom named her, so I guess because she died when I was a kid? Oh. Let's watch it! Gelsomina! Rosa is dead! Rosa died! This is Zampano... the one Rosa left with. My poor Rosa. Zampano, this is Gelsomina. She looks a lot like Rosa. Hit the drum. That part of you sure hasn't changed. What part? Your complete refusal to be on camera. Zampano has arrived! That's not quite right. How about being in my movie, then? No way. Zampano has arrived! Why not? It'd be fun. You know, I can see if people are garbage or not. I'm definitely not doing it. You're scared of seeing your true self. I don't see what you're trying to say. You said something else weird, didn't you? Something like me being in a different "world" than everyone else. What did that mean? Pretty much face value, that one. It wasn't anything deep. Do it! Zampano has arrived! You're a bit like Zampano. Zampano has arrived! Say it like this! "Zampano has arrived!" It's raining out there. I'm glad we took shelter. Zampano... Zampano... Would you mourn me if I died? Are you going to die? Have you ever wanted to die, senpai? I've wanted to kill before. Why are you asking me that? You say some pretty odd things. Go to sleep. Zampano. Zampano. I used to think that if I had a life like this I would rather be dead. I have never thought that. Not about wanting to die. Really? But, listen, Giulietta. What? What I have thought since you died is that maybe I really do want to die. Then you might finally be alive. Dead people don't think about dying. They don't even know they're dead, you see. Zampano. Zampano. Zampano. Do you love me at all? Drop it. Go to sleep. I really don't understand how you could visit someone's place for the first time drink their booze, throw up, and act both delicate and bold. You don't need to understand me. Why do you have so much booze in your fridge? You're not even old enough. The hell... are you saying it's my fault? Get on, you spewer. Look at the time! The last bus will be here soon. Either I carry you to the bus stop, or you're walking home from here. Which will it be? The last bus is just too early. This time it's the bus's fault? Off we go! Are you feeling alright? Not at all! I'm dying. Senpai. It's still right there. I will kill you if you miss that bus after making me run this much. Senpai. Would getting on that bus and ending up in a completely different place only happen in a movie? Can't you tell that the bus is the whale from Casanova? Fellini's Casanova? You watched it just last year in the A/V classroom. Thanks, senpai. I'm going to ride the whale home, okay? I'm home, Giulietta. Chiyoko? Chiyoko? Chiyoko! Chiyoko! Chiyoko! You smell like booze! Hey... were you drinking?! Chiyoko! Come on... get up! Why-- Stop smiling and get up! Chiyoko, up! What happened to you? I'm sorry. It was a joke. No, it wasn't. You actually do want to be a dog, don't you? - I lied. - You didn't. I lied. You sure are stubborn. This is obviously the truth. No, no... I'm not saying that being a dog is bad. Of course, I'm not saying it's good, either. How can I put this... I want to know what exactly a dog is to you, Miyanaga. So? How about opening up to your teacher for once? I'm sorry. My dog died last winter, and I wrote something I shouldn't have. Well... you seem to be taking your club activities seriously. I suppose there's nothing to worry about? Right. Film studies can't go on forever, but it will eventually come in handy for you. Right. So... How long has it been since your mom died? - 10 or 11 yea-- - That has nothing to do with you, sensei. Yeah, you're right. Did I tell you that I was in film studies before graduating from here? You've told me that dozens of times. And that's why you're the club's supervisor. Yeah. I was classmates with your mom. We even recorded a movie together. We had so many people in the club back then. It was a lot of fun! Mom was in film studies? You didn't know that? It's just... I thought that's why you joined that club. You're here. Since you're here, help me organize the cabinet. Okami told me to organize it so that we can get the ones we want easily. Sorry, I'm not in the mood. Good morning, Kiriko-chan. You're pretty into it. Tsuji-san will be here around 5. Okay. Your boyfriend, huh... That sounds weird. Could you please at least say hello to him properly? Suuuure. Chiyoko! It's nice out today, so let's go ahead and deal with this thing! It'd be weird to just let it sit here forever. You're horrible. Why would you say that? It's been half a year since Giulietta died, you know. That doesn't matter. You can't do that! You're horrible, Kiriko-chan. You've already moved on from Giulietta-- There is no way I ever could! You don't even understand that? Chiyoko. You will never take a step forward if you don't lift your foot. I don't see what you mean. I don't want to take a step forward. Kiriko-chan, you're stupid! Did you record that, senpai? Yeah. It's like... the diary of an academic failure. You won't get into university if you keep doing stuff like that. Doesn't matter. I aim to be an eternal university-hopeful. That would just make you a NEET. [No Employment, Education, or Training] I suppose it would! You're an idiot. Okay, let me ask. What do you want to be? Senpai. You said before that you've wanted to kill, right? You can if you want. Kill what? Me. Did you hear me? I'm saying you can kill me. I will. ...is that what you want me to say? I've heard that before. Have you? This is my uncle. He's... my savior. My movie-loving eccentric of an uncle. This place used to be his office. Then 3 years ago, when he died of heart failure, I inherited it all from him. I may never have killed a person but I have killed a cat. Right after I started middle school, my parents got divorced and took off. I was left with my uncle. And just stayed here. This is just a shitty world we live in. There was this cat my mom left behind. I took it, put it under my shoe, and crushed it to death. But I didn't feel a thing. I was still empty. The blood on the floor was a beautiful red. Masamune. You can't just go killing things. He put me on the back of his bike and we went on a trip. With no medical license, he would volunteer as a "doctor". I didn't really know why, but he dragged me along. We went to all kinds of places and saw all sorts of things. My uncle left his camera with me the whole time. "Take in everything you see and consider it carefully." Killing something or someone as weak as you are won't change the world one bit. That leads to an eye-for-an-eye world. Is that how it should be? You have to live your life to your last breath. Take your time. Use that time to figure out for yourself what you should and shouldn't do. "What the hell is this old fart saying?" "That's too much for me." That's what was on my mind but somehow I got into it and started using the camera. And something odd happened. Somewhere inside the dead shell that was me, something... felt like it moved. The Masaoka Masamune Story: Episode 1. Clack. "Present your thoughts in haiku." Masamune! See? Surprising, isn't it? That's my uncle's voice. I'd have liked you to meet him. You're both strange. I think you'd have gotten along. Senpai. That whole story was a lie, wasn't it? Who knows? Do you think it was real or not? Miyanaga Chiyoko. Why do you want to die? You've got it wrong. Miyanaga Chiyoko has been dead for a long time. Then who are you? I am Chokolietta. What the hell? It's nothing. It's nothing at all. Goodbye. How about being in my movie? You're bothering me. I already told you no. The dead Miyanaga can shut her mouth. I want to put that Chokolietta in my movie. Are you a fucking idiot?! Have a look! Nobody would help me, so I did it alone. It's in perfect chronological order. Aren't I great? Is this why you asked us here? Let's go, let's go! This is a waste of time! No, wait, don't go. That's not-- This is why. What is it? An 8mm film I dug out of the ruins. Look who recorded it. Director: Okami Katsuhisa... - Our supervisor?! - Yeah! And he recorded it in his second year! This could be a bad omen! This "Aoki Kayoko"... That's my mom. - No way! - Seriously? Okay, I'm starting it! It's exactly the same! They're even wearing the same uniforms! Wow... It really is the same. It's a bit hard to see. Aoki Kayoko. 16. I like to watch movies. I recently went to the theatre and saw Federico Fellini's La Strada. I'm not really sure why Giulietta Masina's performance as Gelsomina is so famous. Watching her just irritated me. But I'm still curious. Why is it so famous? Okapi... I'm done with this. This is stupid. But... the light is working with us right now. Please keep going for a little bit. How long are you going to record me? Dumbass! - Oh, crap! It'll get ruined! - Oh no! What's happening here? Just... wait... the mask! - The mask! - Hold on! - What are we supposed to do? - I have no idea! Get Oka-chan! - Hold on! Just wait! - Go! Now! Hurry! What's with-- Giulietta. Come here. Giulietta. Dad's home. Honey, welcome home. I'm home. Ohhh! I'm back, Giulietta! Come on over here! Were you good today? You worked late today. Would you like some food? Choko-chan? Chokolietta seems to be asleep! She told me she saw something interesting at school today. An 8mm film from when I was in high school. Did I tell you? I was in film studies back then. So she found an 8mm I was in back then. I was 16 years old and completely against being in it-- Oh, Chiyoko... Why don't you sleep in your bed? Nah... I'm watching this. You were asleep. Nah... I was watching it. What is this? "I... remember." Fellini's Amarcord. I'm going to bed. I've got an early morning. Don't turn it off! I'm going to watch it. You know this movie? No. I just want to watch it since it's Fellini's. No. You're mean. Do you know what time it is? Kids shouldn't be up this late. This is also not a movie you pick up half-way through. It's an insult to Fellini. Plus... I can't let you watch a movie like this for the first time with a dub like that. Your first time should be more special than that. Understand? Mom... probably would have said the same. Had she seen it, too? This movie? Of course. There's no way we wouldn't have seen this movie, is there? Chiyoko. What? About Kiriko... Just... Let her off the hook. The Summer Film Miyanaga Chiyoko. Say your real name. I am Chokolietta and I am a dog. But here's the sad part: I have a human body, so I have no choice but to go to school. My grades in the first semester were terrible, but nobody cares because I'm a dog. Kiriko-chan and Dad both have their own lives, too. Kiriko-chan? Kiriko-chan is Dad's sister. One member of our cursed little home. The one-week housekeeper became the eternal housekeeper. What the hell? But I think the curse's power is starting to fade. She got a boyfriend for the first time in 10 years. Will she finally escape this prison? That'd be boring. They should just break up. Let's stop this. This doesn't make for a very good movie. Maybe you should just go home and study? Shut it. Are you even studying? I don't need to. I'm a dog. This is stupid. Tell me more about that curse. You don't know what that is? It's the same as yours. You have your uncle's curse, and I have my dog's. Do you mean Giulietta? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I'm done with this. I'm going home. Tell me about Giulietta! Okay, but I'm only going to lie to you. Just a big pile of lies! That'll be fine. Your lies and your truths all sound the same. Senpai, I never know what you're saying... I have no idea what you're trying to say! I am Chokolietta. Giulietta is a hybrid like me, and my friend. We're friends, but we don't talk. We don't need words. We're fine just being together. And how does Miyanaga Chiyoko fit into this? Who is that? I don't know her. Maybe she's already dead? When? When was it... A long, long time ago. So far in the past that mountains and rivers were still pretty. Yeah, that's right. She's already dead. Where did she die? In the mountains. Her dad was driving. Her mom was in the passenger seat. They were heading to her dad's friend's cottage. But I... No, not me, Chiyoko. Chiyoko didn't want to go to the mountains, but to the ocean. So she got into the car wearing her favorite float. What happened to that float? It is long since forgotten. That was a lie. All of that was a lie. Mom and Dad were watching a movie together just recently. It was one of Fellini's movies. I said I wanted to watch it with them, and they yelled at me, saying not to watch it. They said they watched it together a long time ago. I wanted to watch it with them... This is unusual. You like Fellini yourself! I'm not sure if I do. What I do like is Giulietta. Is that the dog? Or Giulietta Masina? Both of them. Maybe in different ways? Gelsomina, played by Giulietta Masina in La Strada... She is my friend. Poor little Gelsomina. She's dead, now. Went out on her own. And then after that she came to my house. - Gelsomina did? - Exactly. Gelsomina, the character, was reborn as a dog. Mom saw her at a shelter and knew immediately. So she brought her home. But... naming her Gelsomina again was a bit much, and that's why Giulietta became her name. Giulietta Masina had a long life, after all. She married Fellini and was with him to the end. Only a few months after Fellini died, Giulietta followed him. I'm pretty sure I told you that. Did you? It's not a big deal. She and I were really close. You and Giulietta Masina? No, no... Why would you say that? Have you been listening? If I say Giulietta, I obvously mean my Giulietta. Right. She was all I had. She and I would sit together all the time in the foyer waiting for Mom to come home. But she left me behind again. Why didn't she take me with her that time? Another lie. Senpai, I've had enough. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want any of this. I hate you, senpai. I hate everyone. Anyone and everyone. Even myself. Absolutely everyone. I hate them all so much. It's 3 nights and 4 days in Hokkaido. All-you-can-eat crab, sea urchin, and grilled meats and veggies. Tsuji-san invited me. It's next weekend. Oh, is it now? Have a blast. I want to ask you to handle the house. Housekeeping, huh... I can trust you, right? With what? Chiyoko. You've been going out every day. What are you up to and where? I'm just helping a friend with a movie. And... that's what I've been telling you all along. Is this friend from film studies? Yeah, pretty much. Oh. What's this friend like? Nothing special. Just your average human. Or completely abnormal! Thank you for the food. Chiyoko. Kiriko-chan is... soooo mad at me. "Should you be going out every day for this or that over the summer?" "Are you keeping up with your studies?" "I'm trusting you. Do you know what that means?" "I'm trusting you, so don't betray that trust." She says things like that. And betraying her... would that be like having sex with you and getting pregnant? Getting caught stealing, or doing drugs? I think there are a lot of ways to do it. I think those are what she means. But... would turning into a dog be betraying her? Would that count? What do you think, senpai? Whatever. Let's assume that I have sex with you and get pregnant. We could rightly say that is a big deal, but in the grand scheme of things, it actually is pretty common and normal. But I don't think we can do something so normal. Senpai. You actually really want to kill someone, don't you? But you have your uncle's camera, so you can't. Instead of killing me, you're waving your camera around. Instead of getting killed, I'm getting recorded. It's strange from both angles. I, myself, am weird... but so are you, senpai. Quite strange. But you wouldn't know it, looking at you. The fact that we are a homicidal lunatic and a dog is something nobody would realize. So I have to wonder if I'm actually betraying her trust. If I am, then it's quite a way to do it. It might be the deepest type of betrayal such that it's hard to even call it that. Why are you laughing? You're funny, you know. There's nothing funny about this. You're right. We are pretty weird. Senpai, you don't get it. You don't get it at all. Senpai. What? I'm tired of this. I want to go somewhere. Being in here is boring. You want to go somewhere? We can go grab some ice cream at the store there. Somewhere far would be better. I want to go somewhere very, veeery... far away from here. So you want to go to the mountains or the ocean? I hate mountains. The ocean would be better. Yeah! Let's go to the ocean! Are you going to doggie paddle your way to Hawaii? I hate you, senpai. Okay, so... How about this? We go on a trip together. I will be Gelsomina, and you will be Zampano. We'll go somewhere together and perform along the way! Open it up. You look odd. Let's go. Senpai, this is awesome! Is this your secret weapon? Why were you hiding this? I wasn't hiding it! It's an assault by exhaust fumes! Zampano has arrived! Zampano has arrived! Zampano has arrived! What are you doing, onee-chan? I'm not an onee-chan. Then what are you? A dog named Chokolietta. Huhhhh? A dog?! A dog...? - Bye bye, Chokolietta! - Bye bye! We got some pretty good footage. Do you feel better now? Well... I guess it's time to head back. I'm not going back. I'm not. I said I wanted to go further, didn't I? I've been here with my uncle before. The balding old man and the cute young boy elope together. Sounds romantic, doesn't it? Rest a bit. We're leaving early tomorrow. Where are you going? Shopping. I'll be back soon. Lock the door. This is the power. Start and stop. Beyond that, just point it and it'll record. Make sure you don't drop it. I know. Have fun with that. Time for us to get some sleep. Okaaaay. Good night! Wear this tomorrow. Do you really not need to go home? Why do you ask? Don't be silly. Won't your family be worrying by now? That won't be a problem. Dad won't be home for a while, and Kiriko-chan is on vacation with her boyfriend. So that's why... That's why. Senpai, do not come to this side of the bed. Rest easy. Dogs aren't my type. Don't come to this side, anyway. You think a lot of yourself for a dog. Senpai. Will we get to the ocean tomorrow? If we take a shortcut through the mountains, we'll get there pretty fast. I hate mountains. If we avoid them, we'll end up taking quite a detour. I really hate mountains. Senpai. Promise me we won't go to the mountains. Okay. I promise. Senpai. What now? Go to sleep. I... don't need to go back home ever again. Close this up. Move the elephant. You've been here before, right? Yeah. But it's changed somehow. It has a weird vibe now. Let's go. What the hell? What's with this? What's wrong? I'm lost. How's it looking? Just fine. I'm getting some good footage. What? What? I can't hear you! That was close. Hey, is the camera okay? Are you okay? You liar. You promised me. What? I told you that I hate mountains! I hate them! Completely! Why can't you understand that?! Sorry, my bad. I knew I should have given up on this. I shouldn't have been in your movie. I never should have gone anywhere with you. Oh? I don't think this is really "mountains", though... Well, fine. I'm used to your crazy way of flip-flopping all the time. Let's go ahead and turn around and get out of the mountains, then! Sorry, Miyanaga. Sorry. I hate you, senpai. Go away. Go away! Sorry. Zampano abandoned Gelsomina. Masaoka Masamune is abandoning Chokolietta. Chokolietta has arrived! Chokolietta has arrived! Chokolietta has arrived! I'm done with this. Stop! Chokolietta has arrived! How long are you going to lie there, you idiot? Who are you? Where are you going? Take it. Head on home now. That, too. I'm a piece of shit. Stupider than I thought and the biggest piece of shit. You really are. I thought you understood. I thought I did. But it turns out I didn't understand anything. Fuck. It's okay. You don't need to worry about it. You didn't abandon me like Zampano would have. You know, Miyanaga... I'm not Zampano. I know. And you're not Gelsomina. Is Chokolietta planning to trap Miyanaga Chiyoko in the dog house forever? What do we do now? The ocean? Want to go? Then we're ocean-bound! Senpai... This isn't what I had in mind. Don't expect a silver platter. This is the ocean. Like it or not. This place is special, too. It's the furthest we can go. I guess it's not really that bad. What the hell am I doing?! I need to stop fucking around! Are... are you okay? I suppose it's true that the ocean makes you want to yell. I don't want to yell. You don't? It feels good, you know! Since you're a dog, try barking at it. I'll pass. Why would you pass?! I'm hungry. Here. What about rice? Don't expect a silver platter. Senpai. What would you have done if I'd refused to do the movie? Why ask now? If I had... would you have just been studying? I suppose. I'm not even sure why I'm going to school in the first place. Do we grow up specifically to give up our dreams? I don't get it. I'm just too stupid. What about you? What would you have been doing if not this? Me? I would probably have tried to find someone to kill me. You still want to die? I'm not sure. But I don't mind you killing me if you want to. You're quite a piece of shit, yourself! Miyanaga. If you really wanted to die, you'd have gone to the mountains. And I would kill you there for the movie's finale. Don't you think? But that didn't happen. Exactly. I don't want a finale like that. I don't even need it. Miyanaga. What? Do you not see how shitty this world is? I do. Of course I do! The entire world is just shit. I've known that since I was little. Perfect. You're at the lowest you can be in this shitty world so you end up wanting to hurt yourself out of desperation. But think about that for a second! That's exactly what the ones running this shitty world want! They tempt people until everyone around you turns to shit! There's absolutely no reason to ever do what those shitheads want! You don't have to prove yourself to shit! Do you get it? Yeah. More or less. I get it now. I just got it perfectly straight! I won't become exactly what they think I will! I am a revolting slave! I won't kill you, or anybody else! That's... your uncle's curse! Senpai, you have a nosebleed. Whoa. Wow... It's for real! This is the curse! Shit! I will live a really long life! I will live until the Earth's final day and make a video out of it! We're... going to end up going back no matter how far we go, aren't we? This country is a small island, after all. I thought we might eventually end up in Italy. But that's not happening. Not on that old bike, anyway. Alright, then. I'm starting over. You wait right there! Wait right there! Let's go. Do it quickly. Let's go. Bye. Wait, senpai! What? We still haven't finished it. We don't have a finale. Ready to do this? Ready. Hey... be careful. Hey. Say something. It's hot out. I'm thirsty. I'm... hungry. Is that all you've got? Say something better. I don't know what to say on the spot like this. You're mean. You make other people talk and talk. Masaoka Masamune. Say your real name. Drop it. How boring. I guess summer vacation is just about over. Senpai, what did you want to make? It wasn't actually me that you wanted to record, right? You probably don't even care what happens to Chokolietta. I... am not too sure anymore. You just can't get it together. Miyanaga Chiyoko. Who are you? I am just a stray dog. Just kidding! I don't even know. How long are you going to record me? Dumbass! What have you been recording for the last while? Just... I'm not sure. You're weird. I'm going home now. You can have this. I don't need it, so it's yours. Thanks. Bye. See you later. See you later. The Autumn Film This is cake that Tsuji-san brought with him. 8Bq. [Becquerel (Bq): a measurement of radioactivity] This is a leaf. 20Bq? Chiyoko... stop that and eat. Okaaaay. What sort of project is that? It's not really a project but more like a diary. I want to see it finished. I feel like an entire world I've never seen before is opening up right in front of me. Tsuji-san. Say your name. I'm Tsuji Masahiko. I plan to wait for you, Chiyoko-chan, to graduate and then marry Kiriko-chan. Will you let me do that? Isn't that... Why would you say something so important right now, in this situation? Is that a no? It's... not a no. But this isn't right. It's not? My head is starting to hurt... Stop recording this! Masaoka Masamune. Masaoka Masamune. Masaoka Masamune. Masaoka Masamune. Masaoka Masamune. Masaoka Masamune. Masaoka Masamune. Masaoka Masamune. Masaoka Masamune. The very short anime: Kurume's Great Prophecies. I'm a prophet named Kurume. Since I'm a prophet, let's come up with a prophecy! In 3 seconds, we'll move to another day after a war. Have a look at this mess! This is a mountain made of debris! And look! I've got no hands! What's up? This. Masamune-senpai sent it. Did you watch it? Yeah. It's what I'd expect of him... I don't understand it, but it's good stuff. Why would he send one to you? I have no idea. He probably thought you'd just destroy it if he sent it to you. Want to watch it? Nah, it's whatever to me. I am Chokolietta and I am a dog. What? You said it's "whatever". That startled me... I'm the one who should be surprised. I just suddenly get a DVD from him and I see you in it saying all kinds of stuff I don't understand. Even I don't really understand any of it. Were you dating Masamune-senpai? There's no reason I would. Oh, right... let's show this film at the cultural festival this year! We'll show it with Oka-chan's 8mm one. We'll pit mother and daughter against each other, directed by an up-and-comer and an Old Boy. It'll be a hit. And the two of us will have new work to show, too. Mine is great. "Kurume's Great Prophecies". It's a literal masterpiece. Mitsuhashi Tomo... Having a look at you now makes me feel like I and the entire world have futures whether or not I fret over it. Right? That wasn't praise. Either way, things will be fine. After the culture festival, we'll be overflowing with new blood. I'll see it through. How can you say that so confidently? Isn't that obvious? Film is forever, you know. Weeds! The ocean! The sky! Sand! Shells! Rocks! With appreciation and affection to Director Federico Fellini who gave the 15-year-old me a love for film.
