Well done? Nonsense' I hate this feeling of losing control Do you know all my plans will be messed up by this kid I've slaved for 5 years waiting for the Creative Director position and now it will go to that Lily Ma And the craziest part is I don't even know who the father is I drank so much that night...

Tiger Lu. 45 years old 20 years ago was just a fisherman in Hong Kong He created the "Tiger" brand of seafood sauce A year ago Vivian introduced him and Michelle and he fell in love at first sight No matter how directly Michelle rejects him it still can't thwart his unrequited passion Women marry for status and position Men marry for a comfortable lifestyle I'd rather marry seafood sauce than marry him Don't worry if you're not satisfied at first There's plenty of time to fi>< him up after you get married You know what marriage is? It's the process of a woman molding a man into shape And then add on a disappointing ending Whatever' Take advantage of the fact that he wants to marry you The most important thing is first to get hitched You know what? A woman's value depends on if there's a man willing to pay for it That's crap' Women these days don't need men to pay for them Whatever these men can offer we women can get for ourselves too Men are turned off by a Woman We you I'm telling you a woman who doesn't understand what a man needs is the type of woman that a man doesn't need Whatever' You think I'm going to take marriage counseling from a women who's been divorced three times? I'm leaving Michelle! Open your eyes and look around For your career. you definitely know what you're doing but when it comes to relationships. you're really clueless Look there... Look' Look at all those women just like you over 30 and still waiting for Prince Charming Don't mix up love and marriage. okay? Find a safety blanket then keep looking for someone better! My experience has taught me that all of this will disappear and all life will leave you with are the wrinkles on your face the children that you've borne and the money from your exhusbands I really have to go You remember that movie you like with the lady playing the flute? The spinster teacher in her 40s still living with her parents? Do you want to be just like her alone with your parents till death? I'm going to bed. You coming? Yeah? I smell seafood sauce Shelly!

How on I got you the room so I had a key I came in to help turn you over You drank so much. hadn't thrown up yet I was afraid you'd be lying on your back so if you threw up while sleeping you'd choke to death Why didn't you just let me choke to death! How can you say that? What happened then was when I tried to help you up you grabbed me and kissed me. Really? Was \ that desperate? You were Wan Tell me do \ have any birthmarks anywhere? Answer me' I don't remember It all happened so fast and I was too excited to notice every little detail You Md me that you don't want to be alone to end up like "The Flute Player" waiting to die alone And then you asked me to sing Forever Waiting for You You am Md me that you love it when I come close and blow in your ear You said you loved it!

Don't believe her You're not wearing clothes? I just took a shower Seriously. I just got out of the shower... Wave my pants on Look' Do you want to go over the creative proposal for tomorrow? I was just thinking about that Tell me. why does everyone think that pregnant women should be smiling all the time? Aren't pregnant women the happiest in the world? Are they? What if this woman was raped and then became pregnant? Or if she's pregnant but can't even find out who the father is? Or she's pregnant with an unhealthy baby? Or if it was an accident and she hates the accident she doesn't want this baby but is scared of losing her potentially only chance to become a mother! Tell me. would this woman still be smiling? Would she still feel happy? Lame idea! Who would buy that! So your company's baby milk powder includes all the nutrients that a woman needs during pregnancy The choice of self-reliance. for strong mothers! I'm very sorry What kind of creative is this? Unbelievable! I'm really sorry. She hasn't been herself lately Is our milk powder only for the unhealthy? Are you okay? Yes or no. Michelle? Are you okay? Then why did you change the concept like that last minute? You're lucky she's a friend of mine We're getting a second chance You know, Fm nut mad at you It's just that I'm not gonna be here tomorrow and I need you to deliver Being capable. Michelle makes a great leader. a great Creative Director Now I have confidence in you and your team... Is it cool in there? Wanna come out? It's okay They're all gone Come on out Don't worry about it Bill's not that angry Of course he's angry Didn't you notice? Whenever he doesn't want to tell the truth. he does... this Didn't you see that? You know him so well What about me. then? What gesture do \ have? I don't know Maybe because you never he Come back tomorrow I'll come with you You were right aboutfthe creative proposal. you know Using the image of pregnant women to sell milk powder is anything but creative Maybe we could use a special mammal instead I know this sounds crazy. but... A Pacific grey whale needs to drink 35 kilos of milk a day totally depending on the mother to inject the milk to her baby's mouth Swimming and breast-feeding at the same time Tough job. isn't it? If she had milk powder it would be much easier I didn't realize you were so knowledgeable How do you know so much about wild animals? \ read a m Do we really need to rush? Didn't you say that wildlife expert is getting off work soon? I also said that he would wait What if he doesn't? The exit! The exit! Haw m \ saw m Will you let me drive?

Sleep tight Fever gone? Much better thanks Now you know why I like it here Can I ask you something? Sure What can \ do to convince you that I'm a reliable guy? I don't understand What do you see in me that's so great? You're not that great Nut yum“) not that gorgeous bad-tempered and rather domineering But I know it's all just a tough act Because m my eyes when you act innocent when you may dumb or when you goof around you seem just like a little girl Especially when you're fragile you can be really adorable Whenever that happens all I want to do is take care of you and make you happy I just can't let you go I know it's kind of silly but I just can't do it Michelle I heard you changed the concept again I'm so sorry...

Great work Congratulations Thank you Thank you for your help Stop crying. Come on What happened? Come on.

I don't mean you Anyways. like I said before if you make your nose higher your chin pointier and your eyes bigger I promise you that that BM WM treat you differently Right. Tony? Don't listen to him I think Bill truly appreciates you Otherwise. why would he pick you to be his secretary out of so many girls? That's nonsense He only did that to show his ex-wife so that he could flirt as much as he wanted with all the other office girls petting and patting... I don't mean you At my birthday party he was also flirting with you. petting and patting! Yew We all saw it When you helped him to his room he was practically lying on top of you I was so jealous How on On that night Bill was also staying at the hotel? He stayed in the room next to yours Totally blacked out Like you OK Go ahead You know I don't like to have secrets between us. so... .what's on your mind? Do you remember my birthday last month?

BM, \ me you' The next morning when you woke up did you notice anything... unusual? What brings this up? Nothing Must seems We .we're in the same boat I remember I woke up that morning and everything was a mess even my clothes What happened the night before... it's so... blurry B\urry's great You know the men. they love... forgetful women I'm a forgetful woman My memory is terrible Talking about what happened after we got drunk is so awkward especially since we're already so...very... familiar Michelle You're very special to me Actually I've always had a... . a thing for you I was waiting for the right moment to tell you Michelle Mme you Mme you too Michelle! It's so dirty... This is fine. Just take your seat Sorry. I'm so sorry It's okay Listen.

Trust me' Michelle. wake up! Stop daydreaming You're getting married again? Wasn't it you who wanted to try on wedding gowns? Suck' Suck it in! Are you sure you want to haye Bill's baby? You don't understand Of all the guys I ever met he's the one with the best genes Genes are not as important as family history The Kennedys have great genes but that doesn't stop them from dying so suddenly So when are you planning to tell him that you have ms baby? And what if he doesn't want it? Will you still have it? Yew I've made up my mind I'll have it either way In China being a single mother is not encouraged There's trouble with household registration and then there's all the fines My opinion is. if he doesn't marry you don't have it Your parents won't like it either It's Bill! He wants to invite me to dinner to get to know me better Get to know you more deeply I presume You are so beautiful right now under this light like an angel This is amazing The food is so good here Let me Good.huh? Sum; You've lived in China for a long time so your parents must miss you a lot How are they? They're good. Very happy and healthy My grandmother is like... 102 years Md She just keeps going What's that? Are you sick? News No. I'm not sick I was in the Maldives. sun-tanning and I forgot to put some...

Sure Bill do you like kids? Why? Nothing Just curious You were marned aver 10 years No kids? Maggie didn't like kids. so... That's Why We broke up I think it's strange not to have kids running around. you know Especially for someone with really really great genes like me I think it's my responsibility to... provide society with... quality kids Fm pregnant It's yours Are you sure? Yeah, Fm sure You are the my man \ had this year If you don't believe me We can have a DNA test m seven Weeks '(owe gonna keep n? Yeah. Of course Why? Like you said we can make a contribution to society Don't you think we're just... .moving a little too sudden here? Maybe we should take... take the seven Weeks and then we'll see Cu... Seven Weeks? Yeah Listen Don't get me wrong. I'm gonna have the divorce But if they find me at fault I could lose everything I don't need your money I just want to keep the baby OK. We just... lUSt keep this quiet very quiet for the seven... for two months and. then we'll see Finally. It's us What's wrong? You know. it's... It is getting late. and I thinkl should... I should probably go Alright Must be an old building See ya! What a Mar Totally not taking responsibility Bill's not like that I mean. his divorce isn't final yet and his ex-wife is... You're so naive Every single one of my men said that women should love everything about their men But you know what life taught me? That women should love themselves more than any men If you really want to keep this baby my suggestion is don't put all your hopes on Bill Find a few backups and first marry someone who's willing to marry you I don't want to marry Tiger Lu I'm talking about Tony Zhang But that's really unfair to him Unfair? Didn't he say he loves you? If you don't let him dish out that love how would he ever learn what's the price of love? Last time you said Aarif Lee was too young for you This time it's Fei Yu Ching You should like that I'm thinking if my grandma was still alive she'd love to go with you So whose concert would you like to go to then? When I was your age nothing could tire me out but now. just thinking of doing certain things makes me tired already A concert? I'd much rather stay at home and listen to this Only the sound of ocean waves calms me down It's important to enjoy the process But a process without an end really doesn't mean much What's Wrong WM you these days? After that night at my house I thought things had changed between us Ton? Please stop bothering me and would you please stop talking about that night? Just drop it for now What do you Want? It's Daisy Jo. I can't find her I'm so sorry. She should be in the house I looked everywhere but can't find her She should be... Daisy Jo Daisy Jo Dam; m! I looked there already Careful Daisy Jo. Daisy Jo You said that waves calm you I'm guessing that you like sand as well Michelle. I love you Be my girlfriend What do you want me to do? I really don't understand why you do this to me I know you like me That night of your birthday party. you said... It won't work between us l-low do you know if it won't work? You've never even had a real relationship!
