After all, the state needs versatile trained personnel. - Listen, that you are attached to me? - Marin, wait, what are you doing. - Well, I got offended a remark cannot be made. Any criticism taken with hostility. No introspection. - Well, why did you fall on her like that? - I'll cheer her up wanted. Stands gloomy. Let's Dance. It pours, which means climate.

Taking a break is the enemy of fun. “Oh no, that's enough for me. - Also correct. - Something shows through here. Otherwise you'll get a sheet, Nyurok. - Let's turn it off. Let's talk normally. - Let's. - Good. In cramped quarters, but no offense. - It's too much. - Then one more. This champagne is over. - Yes, I don't want to. - But this is also good wine. - Let's go for space, Nyurok? - What? - And this is very important. Maybe you are embarrassed to drink in the light? So we'll turn it off now. - No, it is not necessary, I will drink like that. - Clever, right again. - To the bottom. Okay. - I have something so dizzy. I just became drunk. - And you lie down, Nyurok. When will I get drunk lie down and take it off like a hand. - No need, why is that? - As you want. And I'll lie down. - It's funny somehow. You now look like one prisoner. - You this, choose the expression that. - No, he's good. Good. Cheerful, still kind. They built a bridge at that time. And I was still 7 years old, and everyone went to watch. Here, and he once says: girl I say you want a little train build? Well, just like the real one. - Well, I went to him straight whole month, probably every day. I brought him bread, bacon, well, in general. And this he tells me every day: well, everything, wheels says ready then he says the rails are ready there, once says - everything. Your locomotive is ready. Pick up tomorrow. Oh, I didn't sleep all night. In the morning, neither light nor dawn, I fly there. And, I come, and this nobody there. They built a bridge and left. I look at the cars running. - My poor you. Buy it. I saw in the children's world in Moscow. - But what is he to me now? - Close your eyes. - What for? - Close, close. - What for? - Open it. - Oh, what is it? - Souvenir. - You will put at home on a sideboard, you will remember the south. I always go where I bring souvenirs. And not from a kiosk. And from a historical place. This one from the cliff where the fanatical crowd dropped the beautiful .. Ahamid. - Beloved of Prince Khazbulat. - Exactly. - What are you? - That's always the case. All my life I have had no luck even the dreams are not the same. Vaughn Mendeleev in a dream I saw my periodic table. Brother dreams that the motorcycle won. And I’m some kind of crow, then a subpoena. And in love to me in general things are not going my way. - Yes? Well, nothing, nothing. Still lucky. - What are you, Nyurok? Do you think i wanted to seduce you? Well, which one is Don Juan? I am a safety engineer. I am already 36 years old. Nyurok, I know the value of women. I see who you are. I want to marry you, Nyurok. - He, the engineer? Yes? - Yes, he is interested in politics. The state needs diversified educated people. - Yes, in general, what are you? I just wanted to cheer you up. - To cheer up? - A witty. He probably joked with the proposal too. - Well, why was he joking? - Well, because. Look at yourself and look at him. What a groom he is. Fat, bald. And imagines himself. If he really was extraordinary personality Well, Balzac for example, well, he was also fat, and I would follow him to the ends of the world. Or the Decembrists. - You know me never made an offer. - So what? Suggestions? Will do it again, a million times will do. Not yet like him. - How old are you? - 23. And what does it matter? - Hmm. What are you? - Really going to marry him? - I do not know. - The water was coming every minute. Nothing seemed to stop raging elements. And at this critical moment, engineer of the 6th SMU AER. Svintsov. This is for me, Nyurok. A daring thought came to mind. And what if you let the bulldozers run on a ledge? It's like that, Nyurok. An hour later the tamed stream was returned to its former course, and the threat to the settlement of geologists was over. Engineer Svintsov awarded in the amount of a monthly salary. My salary is 180. Plus the coefficient. And waist. And this is me in the 3rd grade. I was then recognized as the best drummer. And this is in the 6th. After winning the cross. And this no, it's not me. Who is this? Brother or what? No, not a brother. Oh, this is Bear. Bear, Bear, where is your smile. In Moscow now. In a responsible post. Invites to her, with all the ensuing consequences. I understand, of course, Nyurok, that deep down you would rather be married to a metropolitan. But you must understand my credo too, I'm not a flyer. I will not leave my team. My brother says to me I would live in Moscow like rolling cheese in butter, and who are you in this Giordano Bruno? With its adherence to principles. Do you know, Nyurok? I sometimes think what if I was in place of Giordano Bruno? Would I deny that the earth is round? Or would rather a well-fed calm life burning at the stake? What do you think, huh? Nyurok? - Sanya, why did you decide to marry me? - Your eyes are like 2 mists like 2 throws, from the dark. Which way. What a deception did you sneak into the 20th century. Nyurok, marry me? - You see ... “Maybe you don’t like my mustache?” I am now. I am now. - Will you order more? Then let's pay off. 3,40. You know, I only have 2 rubles with me, but I live close and ... - Ate, drunk, and who will pay? - Nyurok, here I am. Cheer up, girls. The liner is waiting. What is this with us? This is our champagne. - We see that it is not beer. What kind of champagne? - Semi-sweet. - This chocolate is good too. - 10, 40. We will not become poor. Walk like that. Here you go, Marinulkin. For the fond memory of friends, comrades. - What do you. Do not. - Take it, take it. You are a good man. Aboard. This is with me. - Oh, class. - First grade. Now we will beat off the telegram to bratelnik, let him know our. - I am on board the "Admiral Nakhimov", I follow the course of the port of Novorossiysk. - Your brother Sanya. So? - So-so. And from there by plane to their native land. To Ulan Ude. Nyurok, do you want to tap the telegram? - No no. - He's over there, wait. Oops. - Well, what about Nyurok? Take to the left. - Yes, he's gone already. - No, there he is. - Oops, I got it. - Yes Yes. - what you are spectacular. Behind you an eye and an eye. Well nothing, we will arrive in Ulan Ude and immediately to the registry office. - I want champagne. - Well, Nyurok, you pleasantly surprise me today. Let me bring mine, they probably don't have a semi-sweet one. Wait a minute. - How is he? - Nothing. - He is so cheerful, energetic. - Not greedy, right? - Attention, after 20 minutes motor ship "Admiral Nakhimov" move away from the pier. Request to the mourners leave the ship. - Where's the exit here - do not know? - I don’t know, I’m looking for it myself. - Hello! - Oh hi! - Are you sailing with us too? - No, I just came in. And you? - And I'm floating. And I'm getting married. - Well yes? Congratulations. And where are you sailing? - Tomorrow at 8 we will be in Novorossiysk. - At 8 am in Novorossiysk tomorrow? Eh, damn i would do yours I'm sorry to leave the steamer, my vacation is over. - It's a pity. - Deck crew take places according to the mooring schedule. - Do you know where the exit is? “I know, of course, over there. Well, okay, happily, I went. - Congratulations again. - Thank. - I went. - What already? - Happy. This is not true. I don't like to celebrate the New Year alone at all. I hate it. - For the information of the greeters, at 4 pm 30 minutes to the third berth the ship arrives. - Where have you gone? And I'm looking for you. Where is this one? - Get out. - What? Already? - I can not hear. - Don't be upset, Nyurok. We will visit her every year. It's good to have your own man in the south. And she can come to us too for a week, another jump. We will find a gray-winged eagle for her, too. Bye, Marinok. - 10 minutes are left before the departure of the "Admiral Nakhimov" motor ship. - Figaro is here. Figaro is there. Well, Nyurok. For our departure. And the champagne open in the cabin. - You know, I don't want something. - Ah, Nyurok, how impressionable you are with me. Well, you can't kill yourself because of your girlfriend. As if you were deprived of the quarterly bonus. Life goes on. And life goes on. - I'm not because of my girlfriend. - And because of what? - So. The mood is something. - It happens. It happens to everyone, Nyurok. I have for this case one fail-safe tool is available. I start to wiggle my ears.
