I haven't yet talked to anyone... Even not to Cecilie. Perhaps there is nothing to say. Maybe this is normal. I feel weird. That's because I just fleet at the moment. Cecilie feels weird too. And all this because of... the kiss. A kiss in the snow - Are you doing something tomorrow? - No. - Do you want to go to the pool with me? - Sure. - Goodbye - See you He is not in my type. Hello I am sure. - This is the boy for me. - Do you know him? Ask him if he wants to come swimming with us. Hello, my name is Stian. Peder. I have just moved to fifth with my mother. Could I borrow a tongs? I am repairing my bike. Please wait there. I will look for it. - That's it. - Thaks. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You think he is cute? absolutely I think I am in love. You do not even know him. Have you ever been in love? Sure Do you want to dance? No Why? You go out with Cecilie? One might think... But in fact, not really You go out with her, yes or no?

I've tried write to you earlier I tried many times I hope you are still with Cecilie ...as before we met I never wanted to be her boyfriend I just wanted to be her friend as with you besides. Do you remember play in the snow? The hold was... so pleasant when I embraced you. But we must not believe in miracles. But that kiss has melted the snow so I hope that you see... the same rainbow as me. Do not want me if you like, but I realized that I love you.
