Speaking of Aggro, why isn't she back yet? She has been out fishing for a long time. You don't think something could have happened to her? I think we better look for her. Just to be safe. - Aggro! - [Summer] You out here? Aggro! No sign of her. Maybe we should try somewhere else. Wait, there she is! Aggro, we've been looking all over for you. Yeah, I was worrying my super-sight was gonna fail us. And my super-sight never fails us. [laughing] You're right, Cutter. You're so awesome and cool and always save the day. Uh... Why are you being so nice to me? Are you okay? Now that you're all here, I'm better than okay. I can't wait for you to see this amazing island. I'm so happy I could sing. Sing?

Sing with me. I know I have a song for you. What's with those guys? You never leave before the big finish. Am I right? [all cheering] What happened back there? Was I singing? And was I dancing? And was I doing this? [grunting] It was that dragon. Her voice somehow hypnotized you all to sing. She's a Songwing. I didn't realize it at first because Songwings are supposed to live in pairs. In pears? That sounds really cramped and sticky. Burps, she didn't mean the fruit pears. She means pairs as in two of a kind. Oh. Right. That makes much more sense. Yeah, well, this Songwing seems to live with an entire backup band. I've heard about Songwings before, but never actually met one. They're supposed to have "very melodic voices they use to calm down anyone who might attack them." But Melodia is using her voice to make dragons sing with her. Exactly. I've never heard of one doing that before. I've never heard of any of this before. Luckily, her song doesn't affect humans, or we all would've joined her crazy flying chorus. [gasps] Actually, that's a good point. Her songs don't affect the two of us. So, maybe we can convince her to let these dragons go. Worth a try. You guys stay here, where you can't hear her voice. You know, it's a shame we're having such trouble here. Aggro was right. It's a really beautiful island. The river, the trees, the flowers. [sniffing, then sneezes] [shouts] Actually, pass on the flowers. - [sneezes] - [Cutter] Ow! Melodia. Hello? We just wanted to... - Hi. - Talk. Of course. I always have time for my fans. Aggro and Zeppla and the others have told me all about you. It's so great to meet you. I wish you'd sing with me. That's actually what we wanted to talk to you about. - The singing. - You have to let our friends go. Whoa. Are all you humans so angry? You should sing more. The truth is, any of my Melodions can leave whenever they want. - "Melodions"? - "Melodia and the Melodions." [all singing] Sort of trickles off the tongue, doesn't it? If you say so. Your friend Aggro can leave whenever she wants. Just ask her. Okay. Aggro, time to head back to the Roost. Go? But I wanna stay here and sing with my Songstress. - Mm. Maybe give her five more minutes? - No, forever. I'm a Melodion now. ♪ Melodia, Melodia, our queen of song ♪ Oh, boy. ♪ She's got a heart of gold And can do no wrong ♪ Nice, Aggro. A little pitchy, but we'll have plenty of time to work on that. Oh, thank you, Songstress. See? I told you. She's just been touched by the power of song, that's all. - Okay, this is not going to work. - Nope. - We'll be back for you, Aggro. - Soon. I hope you do come back, with those other dragons. I'm always looking for someone new to sing with. Aggro, tell me more about these human friends of yours. It would sure be fun to sing with them, too. - She said, "Forever"? Seriously? - That's a really long time. We have to do something. Melodia won't let any of these dragons leave. Yeah, and Aggro has to come back home. Who will tell me to stop doing all the annoying stuff I do? If we can get to the dragons when Melodia isn't around, maybe we can convince them to come with us. So, we have to somehow sneak past a dragon with a hypnotizing roar, and pull off the biggest rescue mission we've ever done? Mm-hm. - I'm in. - Good. We'll start with rescuing Aggro. Because I think I know how we can do it. Burple and Cutter will come in low from this side.

And now we've lost the Roost, too. The hits just keep coming today. Welcome to our new home, the Maze Caves. No one would ever look for us in here. I know I would never look for us in here, and I know we are in here. So, what's our plan, Ley? How can we break Melodia's spell? If getting the dragons away from her island didn't work, I don't know what will. Her voice is just too beautiful. I have an idea. What if we made a sound that's the opposite of her voice? Something so loud and annoying it'll snap everyone out of it. That's not bad, Burps. But how are we gonna do that? Easy, like this: [grunts] [screeches] [imitates braying] [imitates alarm blaring] [blows raspberry] - Huh? - You definitely nailed the annoying part. Burple, you have the right idea. - You're just the wrong dragon. - Hm? And the right dragon is? [both shrieking] Baby Shriek Scales! Of course! All right, all right, settle down. You wanna take the Shriek Scales back to Huttsgalor, huh? Just for a little while, Grumblegard. We need their help breaking the spell of a Songwing. A Songwing? What, just one? They usually travel in pairs. Not the fruit. [chitters] Let me guess. You think the screeches of these Shriek Scales will be so loud and annoying that it'll snap everyone out of it? [shrieking] [grunts] Actually, yeah. That's exactly what we think. Well, feel free. I could use a little peace and quiet around here. Thanks, Grumblegard. We'll bring them back before you know it. Good luck. You're gonna need it. No sign of Melodia. It's go time. - Shriek Scales? - Check. [shrieking] - Moss? - Check. [both shriek] Then let's make some noise. Hey, everyone. [both] Huh? - Leyla. Have you come to join us? - We're so happy to see you. You won't be in a second. Hit it! [both shrieking] Melodia's voice is like syrup and honey. But that sound is like vinegar and spoiled milk, only for the ears! Rocky, Shelly, help! [gasps] Ah. The ocean. [both] Huh? Look, their eyes are going back to normal. I can't believe it. My plan is working. What is that sound? Oops. Jinxed it. Sorry, Melodia, but this sound is music to our ears.

It's not working. We'll be back for you all soon, we promise. [grunts] Look on the bright side. At least our moss ear plugs kept us safe. - [grunts] - Uh-oh. - [Melodia singing] - Ah... - Burple! - Burple, no! Don't listen to her! But if I don't listen, I'll never hear her beautiful voice. Oh, Burple. Not you, too. And now we're down to four. Well, really three and a half, 'cause I'm exhausted. I'm sorry, guys. That sure didn't work out the way I hoped. - [Grumblegard] You think? - [all] Grumblegard? Maze Caves. A cute hiding spot. It was the first place I thought to look. What are you doing here? We said we'd bring the Shriek Scales back. I know, after your plan didn't work. Yeah, exact... Wait, how did you know our plan wasn't gonna work? I didn't know for sure, but I had a hunch. And when you're 275 years old, a hunch is enough. - Then why didn't you tell us? - Well, you didn't ask. But something tells me you wouldn't have listened anyway. Kids today, too much flapping, not enough listening. We're listening now, Grumblegard. Do you know what will work to break the spell of a Songwing? From what I've heard, you need another Songwing. Another Songwing? We can't even handle the one we already have. Then you're doomed, unless... [all] Yes? Unless you can find someone who can sing better than a Songwing. [laughing] I crack myself up sometimes. Well, on that note, come on, kiddies, let's head home. [gasps] You're not just leaving? Yes. Yes, I am. Good luck again there, Rescue Riders. - I always forget how grumpy he is. - Let him go. We do know someone with as good a voice as Melodia's. Dak, what are you talking about? I'm talking about your singing voice, Leyla. It's just as good as Melodia's. Maybe even better.

[all groaning] - Cutter, back off, you're crowding me. - Yep, Aggro's definitely back. [grunts] Have we all been singing and dancing? - Or dancing and singing, or...? - Or sing-dancing? We'll explain later, chief. Right now, we've got a dragon to help. Help? You'd help me? Yeah, even I'm a little confused about that part, Leyla. You said you lost your Songmate, right? That's why you've been using your hypnotizing voice to make everyone sing with you. - Songwings live in pairs. - But you lost the other half of your pair. And you've been trying to replace it with dragons and people. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I just love to sing, you know? And... It's a lot more fun singing together than alone. Yeah, I totally get that now. We can help you find your Songmate, Melodia. But how? I've searched and searched and sung and sung, but it's no use. Well, maybe you just need to sing a little bit louder. - You really think this will work? - Go on, give it a try. ♪ Fly to me, my mate of song ♪ ♪ I miss your voice, it's been too long ♪ ♪ Hear me now, answer my call ♪ ♪ When we sing as one, we have it all ♪ ♪ Wherever you are, come join me ♪ ♪ So we can be in harmony ♪ Come on, let's all help.
