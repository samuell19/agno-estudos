Joining us for the toss of the coin, the President of the United States... Mr. President, will you please toss the coin? It is tails. San Francisco has won the toss. You can elect to kick... You want the ball? Which goal will you defend? Will you put your backs to the goal, please? Joe Montana joins his teammates on the field. Super Bowl 19. The Miami Dolphins. And the San Francisco 49ers. The best combined records of any two teams to ever meet in a Super Bowl. And Joe Montana. They talk of the cool of Dan Marino. Super Bowl 19. Second quarter. Joe Montana steps to the line of scrimmage, drops back to throw, and then... Montana in trouble and Doug Betters covers him quickly at the 42-yard line. You feel pretty good, then all of a sudden, the pocket starts to cave in. Now this might seem like a failure. A mistake. But of all the characteristics needed to be an all-pro quarterback, this one is rarely talked about. The ability to stay in the pocket. To stay calm and collected as a wall of humanity collapses around you. The courage to stand your ground and take the hit. And then have the will to get back up, and do it all over again. Drop back, settle, deliver the perfect throw. And another record has fallen. Another one to Joe Montana. Falling all over the place. They've really put on a terrific show, particularly offensively... They roll to the right. Montana fires a shot... How much longer? I want to play some Atari. Kurt? Ever since I saw Joe Montana become the MVP of that Super Bowl and break his all-time pass record, I knew I wanted to be that guy. Over a million athletes play high school football every year in America. Each with a dream of their own. Only about 5% of them make it to college ball. And only 1% of those get drafted to the NFL. Most don't stay in the league for more than three years. Most are not quarterbacks. Only a select few will ever play in the Super Bowl... And each year, there is only one MVP of that game. So, by all accounts, my dream, my story is impossible. That's just the kind of story this is. Huddle up. All right, boys. Let's do this. Ah... Trips right, 70-watt special. On one, ready. And that will bring on Kurt Warner, the 5th year senior, making his first start. Remember, folks, he's sat on the bench for four years even though he was highly recruited out of high school. Blue, 60, hut! Warner takes the snap. A strong interior rush... ...and he's levelled by middle linebacker Cole Banks... Go home, Kurt! Go home. Go home. Come on! Let's go, baby. Whoo! Get set, get set, get set. Blue, 60, hut! He's flushed out of the pocket... No, no, no, no. Stay in the pocket. He's running out of real estate and throws the ball across his body towards the corner of the end zone. Touchdown! How you like that, Coach? - You still didn't stay in the damn pocket. - Yeah, you're welcome. Kicking game! Move it! Ineligible, down field. Okay. I'm gonna wear this one. You take this one. No. I'm staying here. I got work to do. Work? Man, you can hardly call that work. How you gonna make a highlight reel with no highlights, huh? You only started two games. Just sayin'. I have highlights. - And who you gonna send that to? - Scouts. Agents. You really are delusional, huh? The NFL's not gonna draft some dude who's been sitting on the bench for four years at a 1-AA school in Iowa. It's madness. Come on. We're going out. I'm never gonna wear this. Hudnutt, how do you listen to this music? It is garbage. We're gonna have a good old time. Let's go. Can we get two Buds? Thank you. I'm gonna make a lap. You do that. Have fun. Blue 80, hut! Hey! No, no, no, no. Stay in the pocket. What did I say? What did I say? To stay in the pocket, Coach. Bingo, hotshot. Hello, and welcome everybody to Sports Center, I'm Karl Ravech. And a very special welcome to the newest member of our Sports Center family, that's Steve Levy. The MO Morris Lewis show of the New York Jets opened up well off-Broadway in Pittsburgh against the Steelers who already had a preseason... Hud? I'm gonna need to ask you a favor and I'm gonna appreciate you not laughing at me too much. Can't wait to hear this. I need you to teach me how to dance. Well, like, dance, like, line dance? Like line dancing, barn dancing, all the dancing... Oh, man, this is gonna be great. This about that girl, isn't it? That's none of your business. You have no idea how happy this makes me. Yeah, I do. You look good. Oh, wow. - Hey, uh, bartender. - Yeah. Hey, uh, can you play a line... Uh, not a line dance. A barn dance for me? All right, it's a barn dance! Barn dance! Grab your partner, do-si-do. Excuse me, cowboy. I'm gonna take this one. Thank you very much. Oh, about time. You don't look like a cowboy. That's 'cause I'm not. What are you, then? I'm a football player. My name is Kurt Warner. What's yours? Nope. Not yet. That hardly seems fair. I mean, I just gave you my name. You're not gonna give me yours? No. What am I supposed to do? Just guess? Go for it. Okay, all right. Um... Abby? Abigail. Gail. Uh, Helen, Isabelle, Jacqueline, Beatrice. You're supposed to be the other way. Yeah, I know. I just like this view a lot more. She won't tell me her name, so... You move real good on that dance floor. Well, that makes one of us. Thank you. Actually, it's... Yeah, okay. What? I like what I like. So, football? Tell me about that. How do you mean? What do you want to know? You defined yourself as a sport. So it must be pretty important to you. Hell, I don't know. I just love it. Well, I like a man who knows why he loves something, so... Okay. Okay, how about this? I'll answer your question, but first, you gotta answer one of mine. Uh, what exactly is Miss August over there? That is, um... That's a tight-fitting jeans contest. Oh, is it really? First Thursday of every month. It's the first time I won. Congratulations. - It's so embarrassing. - Yeah. Um, so football? Seriously. You give me an honest answer and I'll give you my name. Okay. Um... So, football was the most important thing my pops taught me before he... uh, left. I mean, he's back in my life now but, you know, back then it was tough... and we always, you know, struggled. Me and my mom, my brother. Never had enough. And I wanted more. I wanted to make something of my life. And football, um, is just like the only thing I've ever really been good at. So, just feels like more than a game to me. As long as I have a ball in my hands, then I feel like everything's gonna be all right. Is that honest enough for you? You know, I normally hate country music but I kinda like this song. Well, I hate sports, so guess it'll never work between us. - I suppose so. What a shame. - Mmm. What do you like about it? I don't know. I guess that it's different. Kinda like you. I'm Brenda. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Brenda. Last call. And I gotta go. Gotta go? You gotta "go" go? Hey. Hey, come on, wait a second. I mean, is this something that I said? Is it something that I did? Can I at least get your phone number? Trust me. You don't want it. What? Wait, wait, wait. Why wouldn't I? Why wouldn't I? Why wouldn't I want your number? Look, there's a few things you need to know about me. I'm divorced and I got two kids. So, if I never see you again, I totally understand. - But I don't want to. - Okay, just one bite for Mama. One bite. Come on. Okay, sweetheart. Well, I'm making the jam one... The jelly one first, honey. I need you to eat just a tiny little bit more. - Mama? - Oh! Over here, baby. Over here. Over here. Oh, is it broken? Broken, Mama. Okay. Mama will fix that in just a minute. No, Jesse, not for you. But can you just have a few more bites of your applesauce, please, sweetheart? I just... Mom, can you get that? Hello? I didn't mean to scare you. It's Kurt from the bar last night. I knocked on the front door but... This was a bad idea. Okay. Okay, okay, okay... Mom? Mom? Mom, help! Hey. What's going on, little... - Come on. - Oh. Yeah, hey. Am I coming in? It's broken. Oh, it's broken? Uh... What's broken? Oh, the radio is broken. Okay. - Oh, we're going to the bathroom? Okay. - Broken radio. Oh, well. You're missing a battery. That's why we're in the bathroom. Look at that. All right. There we go. Oh. Country? They got you too, huh? Lay down. Okay. There you go. ♪ You and me go fishing in the dark ♪ Lying on our backs and counting the stars ♪ Where the cool grass grows ♪ Down by the river in the full moon light ♪ We'll be fallin' in love ♪ In the middle of the night Just movin' slow ♪ You know? Maybe country ain't so bad after all. What's your name, little man? Zack. Mmm. That's a good name. My name's Kurt. You like trucks? Black trucks. Driver. Oh, you want to be a truck driver, huh? A black truck driver. Oh, what he means is he wants to drive a black truck. Right. Uh... Hey, I'm... I'm Kurt. I'm here for Brenda. I figured. Otherwise I'd be, you know, calling the police. Yeah. I'm Jenny Jo. The mom. Nice to meet you. Kind of you to fix the radio. It was my pleasure. Brenda? Is that the guy? He's cute. Mom, can you please just... And he's so nice. - I know. Okay, now you can go. Thank you. - Yes. Okay. Uh, radio's fixed. Thanks. Um... We keep one in every room in the house. It helps Zack. Look, can I just be blunt? Is there another option? How do you know where I live? The bartender at the bar. And why are you here? Well, I wanted to meet your kids. You seemed so passionate about them last night. And I also wanted to give you this. Oh. Look, I have to get Zack to physical therapy so... Physical therapy? He's legally blind, and... He's on his own journey. Hmm. I hadn't really noticed that. It was really nice to meet you, Zack. Yeah. I'll see you around. Hey. My number. So, maybe call next time? Where's your car? I walked. From UNI? That's like three miles. Oh, yeah. Totally worth it. Come on, Tanner. Doubles, doubles, go. Hut! No! Punt! Tanner, come here. What are you doing? First down's 25. Your job is to move the chains. Come on, boys, we've done this a thousand times before. Hey, Coach. Put me in and I can win for you. Come on. Coach, come on. - "UNI" on three. One, two, three. - UNI! You're back on the bench for the same reason you sat on the bench for four years. What is your problem with me, Coach? You want me to sum it up for ya, why you are such a tragedy? - You don't stay in the pocket. - What? You got the talent, loads of it. But when things get hard, you bail. You run from adversity. You don't trust your team or my playbook. You don't deserve to play in the game. Coach, 10 more games and my dream is gone. I've been working my whole life for this. Please. You need to start thinking about life after football, son. Respectfully, you are wrong, Coach. I'm not gonna quit, because that's not what leaders do. I just need to know how to get on that field. Blue 80, hut! Again. Hut! You could throw. But you cannot leave the pocket. You want your shot? You take the pain. Hurry up! Blue 80, hut! Oh, no, no, no. Don't you fumble my football. You hold onto my football. Again! Again. I said, "Again". Again. How many more times we gonna do this, Coach? As many times as I say. Who else wants to kill Kurt? I do. Hudnutt, you're on offense. I'll switch for this, though, baby. Somebody give me a purple jersey. Come on. Hello? Hey, there. I'm startin' next week. It's Kurt, by the way. Warner. You get my messages? Yeah. All of them. See? I called first. That's good, right? What do you say? Monday night, let's go on a date. What are we gonna do? Walk? Is that a yes? 'Cause it sounds like a yes. I think you're trying to say yes. What are you doing? Got us a ride. Kurt, I have kids. You should've called first. I did call. You hung up on me, don't you remember? God, you're insane. I saw that smile! Yep. Hey, kids... You ever been out here before? - No, it's real pretty. - Yeah. Real peaceful, too. It's one of my favorite places to come. - I dig your tattoo. - Yeah? Semper fidelis. It's the motto of... For the Marines, yeah. Yeah. I saw the pictures on your mantle. When... When I was maybe 12, after church... this woman comes up to me and says... "There's something special about you, Brenda." "God is gonna do something great with you." And... I had the audacity to believe her. So, I had this dream of being a Marine and marrying a Marine, and having little Marine children and God, country, and Corps all the way. So, I signed up right outta high school. Wow. Then, I met Brad. My perfect Marine. Whirlwind romance, marriage... and Zack was born a year later. And what happened to Brad? He cheated on me when I was eight months pregnant with Jesse. Oh... What? So, um... Yeah. I have some trust issues. Was Zack born blind? No. He wasn't. I got this call from Brad when Zack was four months old. He said, "He's breathing funny." And I still remember the panic in his voice. And I rushed to the hospital... where we were told his brain was swelling and that he'd be lucky to make it through the night. And they had no idea what was wrong 'cause... 'Cause Brad didn't tell us, not for 24 hours... that he accidentally dropped Zack. On his head. In the tub. Oh... Could've been different, you know, if he'd just told the truth. I remember praying and praying and begging God to just save my baby boy. So, the doctor told me he'd never walk, and yet... That he'd never talk, and now, I can't get him to stop. That he'd never be a black truck driver. He keeps finding a way to prove everyone wrong. He's... He's my miracle. That all seems pretty, uh, important to you in your life. Religion and God. Yeah, it's more like a relationship for me... and, yes, it defines me. And that lady who came up and talked to you at church all those years ago, you still believe her? I'm trying. I'm a work in progress. This is where you bring all your girls? Oh, are you my girl now? No. - Hey, there. - Hey. You just come with me. Hi. Good to see you again. - Yes, good to see you. - Kurt, this is my dad. - Hey, there. - Hello, sir, pleasure to meet you. - I want Grandma. - Yeah? He's cute. - Oh, will you stop? - Please, I'm married. - That's my sister. - Nice to meet ya. Uh, hey, Dad, could you give us a minute? It's my garage. I wasn't finished yet. All right. Okay, I'm trying to imagine a scenario where any of this works. - What, exactly? - You know, us. Oh, we're an "us" now. That's good news. This is crazy. This isn't gonna work. You keep saying that. I just can't, I mean... So, tomorrow night? - Yep. - All right. Get set! Get set! Get set! Three-sixty! One-sixty! Hut, hut! Hey, hey. How does it feel to make out with a future professional athlete? It was better before you said that. Sixty, hut. Hut! Again. Let's go again. Come on, right now, let's go. Kurt Warner has been absolutely on fire today. There's been a growing buzz that this kid may be a dark horse in this year's NFL draft. I was voted Gateway Player of the Year and our team was first in conference. Look, it's rare that a 1-AA player gets drafted. But let's see what we can do. Thank you! Yes! I promise... Okay, gotta grab this. Look forward to it, buddy. - Yes! - I got an agent! - Let's go! - I got an agent! Hey. Hey. Draft day. How do you feel? Are you nervous? Yeah, no, I feel good. I just want my chance, you know. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Who's this? Oh, yeah, Mom, so, this is Brenda. - And this is her son, Zack. - Hi. Hi, it's nice to meet you. The Bengals have selected Dan Wilkinson, defensive tackle, - Ohio State University. - Pick Kurt. Pick Kurt. Okay, shh, sweetheart. No, no, hey, it's okay. It's okay. I probably won't get picked until tomorrow, though. Tomorrow? Yeah, there's seven rounds of picks that are spread out over two days, so, if I get picked, when I get picked, it'll be in the later rounds. Kurt, it's Zack's birthday tomorrow, remember? We're havin' a party at the house? Birthday. It's my birthday. No, no, no, it'll be fine, Brenda. You guys can start the party, and then I'll just join as soon as this is over. And then, we can all celebrate together, you know? Right. That was something that had been debated for weeks. If Seattle would've said, "Hey, Cortez Kennedy, 27 other teams, "he's out there for a trade." What kind of offers would they have gotten in return? Bye, Kurt. Bye, Z-Man. Bye, Brenda. Drive safe. You sure you're good driving me back? Ain't a problem. You sure that's a good idea? What? Single mom, two kids. That's no joke. I would know. Is that really the life you want? Yay. Who wants cake? - I do. - Yes! - Got a fork? Okay, good. - He's got a fork. Okay, here you go, honey. Another piece of cake comin' right up for you. Great. Uh-huh. Happy birthday, Zack. Want cake? Come on, well, you're just in time for the cake. - Yeah. - You made it just in time. I'm sorry. Mama, I can't wait to eat mine. How's it taste? - Good. - I bet real sugary, huh? How do you feel? Older? I was wondering where you were. Hey. You wanna talk to me? I'm just wondering why God would give me a dream that's probably never gonna come true. 'Cause I just feel like that's cruel, you know? Babe, you know what, I just want... I just want my shot. I... I just... I want one chance, so I can prove... Prove what? Prove that I'm good enough, that's what. I don't think a football game is ever gonna do that. It doesn't have to define you. If this is your dream, you have to go fight for it. So, how do you think the Bears are gonna do this year, son? Well, they just fired Ditka, so things are probably gonna get worse before they... - Did they call? - Hmm? Are you kidding me? Did somebody from the Bears call here today? No, the Bears didn't call, buddy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. The Packers called. - They wanna sign you. - Come on. - No, they do. - Come on! Oh, wow. Congratulations. A $5,000 signing bonus, baby! Pretty great, huh? Thank you so much. It is green. The Packers. Green Bay. Get it? Yeah, we get it. Packers for life. - That's why she's green. - Yeah, we get it, man. Hey. I don't wanna leave you. - I don't wanna leave you. - Oh. You ever feel like your whole life was just leadin' up to one moment? Then go make the most of it. Hey. Hey, you okay? Yeah. I'm happy for you, but I know that this is gonna change things. Your life is gonna get busier, and... Hey, Brenda, Brenda, Brenda, it's okay. We'll figure it out. Yeah. We'll figure it out. - I miss you already. - Me, too. - I'll call you when I get... - You drive safe. I will. I'll call you when I get there. - Packers for life! - You better. Wow. Wow. Step and throw. Move! Move! Yeah, good ball. Nice ball. Thataway, Brett. Thataway to zip it in there. Hey, Pop. Pop Warner. Let's see what you got. Did you hear what I said? You're in. Uh, yeah, Coach, I just got here. I don't know the playbook yet. - You don't wanna go in? - I do wanna go in. I just don't wanna blow it out there. - Give me till tomorrow, I'll know it. - Detner, you're in. Hey, you wanted to see me, Coach? Yeah, thanks for comin' in, Warner. Hey... wish you well. Wait, what? We're letting you go. No, no, you're letting me go? No. I just got here. You haven't even seen me play yet. Well, we tried. No, I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not gonna leave. Not yet. You can't cut me. - You cut yourself, okay? - Coach, please. I have been working for this my entire life. Stop it. Come on. Don't do that. If it were true, you would've been ready to go on the field. You're not. I'm gonna need that playbook. I just don't know what to do, Brenda. I've called every team in the NFL, and no one's interested. I wanna go on, I do. But, I mean, look at me. I'm unemployed. I'm homeless. Oh. Right, I forgot to tell you that Hudnutt's movin' to Des Moines. Then move in. What? With us. My family. With nursing school starting, I could use a live-in nanny. We're both gonna be struggling, so... Why don't we struggle together? Yeah, together. What is your mom gonna think? It's your mom I'm worried about. That woman hates me. I mean, she... I mean... Oh, come on, man. Just throw the dang ball. Football. That's right, Z-Man. You like it? You play. Yeah, I'd really like to, bud, but they didn't pick me. I pick you. I pick you too, bud. $27.12. Yeah. Uh, you take food stamps? Mmm-hmm. Anything else for ya? No. That's... Uh, actually, yeah. Um, can I get, uh... Can I get one of your applications? Yeah. Hey, Mama. - I got a job today. - Yeah? Yeah. Stockin' shelves at the Hy-Vee. Graveyard shift. It's just for a little while. Until next season's tryouts. You know what they say. "Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, "until you can do what you want to do," you know? Don't give up. It's Kurt Warner. Go Panthers. - I gotta get to class. - Hey. Pray for me. We're learning how to insert an IV. I'll be home by 7:00. Date night? No, my shift starts at 6:30. Oh. Sorry. Okay. Think you'd be that guy? Yeah, I do. What are you doin' here? Get it done. Yeah, 'cause it's that easy. Oh, nice hands. Oh. Go long. Go long. Set! Hut! Ow. Come on, man. Yeah, yeah, I got it. Kurt Warner. I've been looking everywhere for you. Jim Foster. It is my absolute pleasure to meet you. And you are? - Brenda. - Pleasure to meet you. Can I sit? Look, elephant in the room, I am sorry about the draft... and the Packers. But you got it all, kid. The whole package. The world just needs more time to see it. Well, thank you. See, this guy gets it. Yes, I get it. And what if I told you, starting tomorrow, you have a job playing the game you love? - What are you, a scout or something? - No. I'm the proud owner and head coach of the Iowa Barnstormers. The newest members of the Arena Football League. Right. You're the guy who came up with this whole arena concept. Last year, I was commissioner of the league. This year, I came home to Iowa to start my own team and I wanna build it around you. So, it's arena football? No, it is not football, babe. It's like a circus. Yes, that's right. You get it. People love the circus. - I like the circus. - Hey, hey. I am gonna play football, and I'm gonna play it in the NFL. And I can't do that if I'm playing arena football in the spring. This is for guys that are, you know, circling the drain. I'll tell you what, just think about it. Get him to think about it. Here's my card. Oops. Dropped a little money there. Brenda, it's all the way in Des Moines. And it's not football. Hell, I don't know! You're the agent. What happened to Tampa Bay? San Diego? There were other offers. Can't you just make some calls? Kurt, that was last year. Look, the teams have moved on. I just don't see a path forward here. I'm sorry. I gotta grab this. - Take care of yourself. - No, no... - Hey, Kurt, can I borrow you a second? - Yeah. Yeah, one minute. All right, Z-Man. We bought our dream home, son. Down in Arkansas. It's closer to Jenny's family. And, uh, oh, it's great. It's a brand-new ranch home. Two-car garage. And it's right down the road from the White River. And there's some good fishin' in there, buddy... So... Well, we'll be leavin' soon. And, um, the thing is... We need to find a new place to live. Well, I'm glad to hear you say "we." Look, uh, Jenny Jo would want me to ask you this. I mean, a good Christian family, after all, and, uh... - Do you love her? - Yes, sir. I do. I knew you did. Do you mind me asking what's holding you up? That's okay. No, no, no. That's fine. Um... I guess I just felt like I needed to prove myself first. Show her I was capable of doing what I set out to do. Be worthy of her. Well, hell, Kurt. Accomplishing one thing or the other is not what's gonna make you worthy of her. Life is not about what you can achieve, it's about what you can become. It's a journey, son. It's not an event. Just promise me this. You won't take off when things get hard. And they will get hard. Yes, sir. Take care of these kids for me. Well, that's a guarantee. I know. A major blizzard caused accidents across the Midwest, Monday, and the dangerous blast of arctic air is expected to spread across the region overnight. Record-breaking low temperatures will make the next few days the coldest the region has seen in at least 25 years. Hey. How's the fever? The same. What happened to the heat? Did we pay the bill? I don't know, Kurt. You told me not to put it in the mail, remember? Damn it. Maybe we should just go to my mom's till the storm passes. Hey. I decided, I'm droppin' out of school, gettin' a job. What? No. No, no, no. No way. Kurt, it's not working. Nothing here is working. Stop. Stop it. Listen, if this is what you really wanna do, I'm not gonna let you quit. Because that's what you did for me, and that's what we do for each other. We are not quitting. Do you understand? Okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. It's bad out here. Maybe we should head back home. - Oh, Kurtis? - Uh... Baby, we just ran outta gas. Okay, all right, there's a... There's a gas station a couple miles back. That was... That was more than a couple of miles. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I can make it there. No problem. No problem. - Just grab the change outta the door. - Yep. And check the glove compartment, too. Yep. Here's some. I got a couple dollars in my wallet here. - Here's another quarter. - All right, here. - Stay inside. - Uh-huh. - Stay warm. Keep the doors shut. - Yeah, be fast. Excuse me, hi. Uh, $4.86 on pump three, and do you have any gas cans? - Uh, yeah, 5 bucks. - Oh, no, no, no. I... I don't need to buy one, I just need to borrow one. I'll bring it right back. Please, please. - All right. - Thank you. Thank you. - Hey. Hey. - Kurt... I'm so sorry, are you okay? Let's get you all warmed up. Brenda, I'm so sorry. You all could have died out there. It's not your fault, Kurt. Yeah, it is my fault. I promised your father that I would take care of you and the kids. So that is exactly what I'm gonna do. Fifty yards long. Eight-yard end zones. Eight men each side. This is not a football field. This is an arena. For gladiators. For true believers and lovers of the game. And right over here is our sideline. In our version of the game, the sideline is a wall. And it will pound you and punish you. Trust me. Kurt Warner. So, did hell freeze over or are you just tired of waiting on the NFL? Uh, bit of both, sir. Forget everything you think you know about football. No punts, no turning back. It's all pressure. It's football at the speed of NASCAR. We call it "the 50-yard indoor war." You think you can handle that, Warner? I think it's time I tried. All right, Red. Well, well, well, look who's still circling the drain. What's up, boy? All right, all right, all right. Well, Kurt, if we gonna go down, might as well go down together. Set! Faster, faster. Pull the trigger. Come on, Warner. Ooh, that'll wake you up in the morning, boy. - Get out of here. - You gotta watch it. Get outta here. You gotta get rid of the ball, Warner. You look like you're movin' in slow motion. Set! One, two, three, throw. One, two, three, throw. Come on! Pain feels good, don't it? Pain feels good, baby! Oh, you can't touch me, boy. You can't touch me, boy. Whatever. Whatever. Man, it's fast. Yeah, you'll get used to it. Uh, if this is where we practice, where on earth do we play? Hey. Hey, Hud. What is that? Oh, that's the Rodeo Arena. Rare cattle, cuttin' horse shows, pony shows. Them pony shows is fresh. We this way. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... That's us right here, right now! Come and take, come and take! The Iowa Barnstormers! They call it the Barn. Let's go, 1-3! The crazies are out in force tonight in Des Moines. Don't touch the dial, folks. The mayhem starts right now. Oh, my God! Taylor fires to Hogan and he is ragdolled over the wall into his own bench. And we got our first fight of the night! That's a good end. That was a good end. A quick slant to Corn Willis in the middle of the field. And he goes in for the touchdown. God help me. On one, ready! And that will bring out a new face. Kurt Warner from the University of Northern Iowa. He had quite a reputation for being a gunslinger with the Panthers. Let's see if he's got any of that cowboy still in him. Oh, boy, that moves fast. - Snap it, snap it, snap it! - Stewart in motion and Warner won't get the snap off in time. Unbelievable. Get him outta here! Trips left. No. Uh, trips right. 50 double, post on one, right! Warner definitely out of rhythm right now. - Set, hut! - There's the snap. Drops back. In trouble, takes off... Buried by defensive end, Travis Leigh. Hey, Red, they got a lemon law on quarterbacks? What are you doing? Warner, that way. Not that way. Ball there. Set, hut! Three steps, drop, throw. Set, hut! Three step, drop, and throw. Late! Set, hut! Late. Late. Set, hut! What are you doin' in that extra beat? Balancing your checkbook? Come on, man. You don't have time enough to drop back and settle like that. It's faster than that. You just gotta pick it up. Push and throw. Push and throw. He gettin' it, Coach. He gettin' it. Set! Left 33, wing out. Z-go. On one. Ready? First in 10 for Jim Foster's 0-1 team. There is growing concern in Des Moines in their old coach's taste in quarterbacks. One game in and the seat is already red hot. His line buys him some time. All right, all right. There we go. Kurt! You got your completion! - Come on! Let's go! - Come on! Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! Let's go! Iowa's ball at the 25-yard line. Get back! Get back! Crowd is making noise for the first time tonight. And there's a little hope sneaking into the building. Stands tall in the pocket. And it's Smallbone, who holds on to the catch. All right. Now we're playin' football. See Mike! See Mike! Warner under center... - Set, hut! - ...surveys the defense. Drops to throw, going long. Touchdown! Yeah, now we're talking. Thank you. And for the first time this season, there's actual excitement in this arena. - There he is. - Come on, let's keep it going. Yeah, yeah, yeah, here. What is this? That's a touchdown bonus. You pay me per touchdown? I also pay you to win. Did you even read your contract? Teach him to read, man. Wait, really, $100 every single touchdown? Every touchdown. Happy to pay it. Oh, this is gonna be fun. The Barnyard comin' to life. It is loud. Touchdown. Drop for Warner. He lets it fly. And he drops it in perfectly over the receiver. Touchdown! Oh, my word. What a play. Welcome to Arena Football, Mr. Warner. Seven touchdowns. Seven, baby. It was epic. Hey, you gettin' my salary checks, right? I told 'em to send 'em straight to you. Yep, I got them. Thanks. Sounds party-ish over there. Yeah, well, you know, right out of... Kurt! I wanna talk to him. Hey! Z-Man! Hey, pal. I miss you so much. I can't hear him, Mama. It's loud. Kurt, listen, I gotta get the kids down. Are you coming home this weekend? Zack's been asking. Um, I'm sorry, hon, no, I can't. We have practice. But, hey, why don't you come up on Saturday, and, uh... You can... you can bring the kids. I have to study this weekend. Look, I'm tired. Going to bed. Love you. I need my partner. Come on. - I'm comin'. - Undefeated, baby. I'm comin', I'm comin'. Come on, now. Come on, Stormers. What a show Kurt Warner's put on all season. 18 touchdown passes. And he's rushed for 12 more... What a hidden gem out of Northern Iowa. Right. Z-cross, S flare. On one, ready. Tell you what, you give Kurt Warner time to throw a football, he is a dangerous man. Set, hut! This was a strike, to Hudnutt with a catch. And a run down the 20-yard line. Come on, Coach! What next? Come on! Okay. Set, hut! Warner, quarterback draw. And he's in! Another Barnstormer touchdown! That's my boy! You all enjoy the game tonight? Yeah, that was great. You were amazing out there. Good. Got a long drive home. I'm sorry. We need to get by through here. We're here to see Kurt. You need a wristband, ma'am. For the meet and greet. Oh, no, no, no. We're with Kurt. Yeah, you and everyone else. No, we're his family. Um... Look, I've got our tickets right here, and I just need to... You still need a wristband. Zack? Zack! Sir, excuse me. Zack? Zack? Excuse me. Oh, my God! Brenda, I didn't even know you guys were gonna be here. I thought you had to study. Well, that's why it's called a "surprise", Kurt. Okay, then why are you upset? Because... I couldn't get to you, and it felt like everyone else could. And then I lost Zack... Because I didn't know you were coming, but, hey, babe, we won. We're going to the semi-finals. I know. It was just supposed to be different. Yo, Kurt, party at our place tonight. - Hey, Bren. - Hud. I don't have to go to that. We've got a long drive home. How's my baby girl? Just fine. How are you? Just waiting on tonight. Sunday night movie night. Miss watching with you. So, what does "just fine" mean? You know... Just... fine. And how's Kurt? Far away. Hey. Uh, no kids? No kids. Do you wanna go grab some lunch? Could we sit and talk for a few minutes? Yeah, sure. Come on in. What's on your mind? I have a question and I'm just... gonna say it and get it out. I want you to know that I'm not angry. I just need an honest answer. Uh, okay. Do you see yourself in my life, long-term? I mean, watching Zack grow up, walking Jesse down the aisle. Standing by my side at my parents' 50th anniversary. Do you honestly see yourself there? Okay. 'Cause I've had a lot of time to think... Wait, wait, wait. Let me answer your question. Kurt, you already did. I'm happy for you. For everything that's going on in your life. But it's not working for my life. - Brenda, you... - Can you please just let me finish? I've been through this before, you know that. And I can't do it again. So... why don't we just skip to that part, and save ourself a lot of time and tears? So... So... Help me understand this. What, exactly? We're just supposed to end it now, so we don't have to end it later? - Yes. - Why? Because you can't decide. You won't... Oh, oh, oh... Oh, no, no, you don't get to pin that on me. No, sorry. You're the one who's afraid. Yes, I'm afraid. Yes, you're afraid. Of what? Of me bailin' on you? Of me hurtin' you? Me being some version of your ex? I'm afraid that we are gonna hurt each other. That is the only way that this ends. You don't know that! Kurt, I want you to chase your dreams, just not with me. Okay. - What is that? - That's my touchdown money. Are you paying me to break up? I'm pretty sure you're the one breaking up with me right now. It was a discussion. It was a discussion and now it's a decision, and you know what? I get it. I get it. You're right, Brenda. You're always right. We should just end it now, and just be done with it, yeah. I gotta get to the game, because apparently, that's the only thing I'm any good at. Anyway, drive safe. Tell the kids I said hi. Left, 50 Pogo, wide cross. Warner! Left, 50 Pogo, wide cross. Come on, man. Left, 50 Pogo, wide cross. Ready? C-44, C-44! Set, hut! That'll do it. With time running out, that touchdown will seal the win for Coach Foster. The Iowa Barnstormers are heading to the Arena Bowl to face Tampa Bay. Shouldn't you be celebrating? I mean, what do you think this is? Come on. Oh, God. Yeah. What? That is not the face of somebody that just made the Finals. Where's Brenda? We, uh... We broke up. Winning doesn't always feel like winning, no? It never has. Why is that? Guess it doesn't mean anything when you don't have someone to share it with. She should be here, Kurt. It's wrong that she isn't. I thought you didn't like her. No... No, I just... I just saw too much of myself in her. I didn't want you to struggle the way that I struggled. But my story doesn't have to be her story. You love her. You stuck with her. With those kids. You have grown up to be a good man. She makes you happy, Kurt. I've seen it. She makes you better. Hi, again. Sports Center hippin' you to what's up. Alongside Steve Levy, I'm Stuart Scott. Coming up, in addition to the items already mentioned, Mark will narrate this. I'm sure he'll put it in proper perspective. Raiders head coach Jon Gruden says... Hello? Kurt. Kurt. Brenda, what's wrong? Kurt, oh, my God, my parents... After the massive amount of damage, large trees are down all over the area and the street I'm looking at, the entire block has been leveled to the concrete foundations. Category 4 tornado that hit at about 7:45 last night... Brenda! Kurt! Hey, hey. I got you. I'm right here, okay? How can this be real? I don't understand. It's not fair. I'm so angry with you. I'm so angry. They're gone. Really gone. I'm just gonna check on the kids. No, no, hey, I'll take care of that. You stay. I sure did miss you, buddy. God, help. I need you. I need you. Hey, hey... Hey, Z-Man. Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up. I just miss 'em. I miss them. Yeah, we all miss 'em. - Wait just a second. - Okay. Okay, look. The way I see it, I'm gonna remember this moment for the rest of my life, so if you're not... Hey, Brenda. I'm gonna be here. I'm gonna be right here. I love you. I love you, too. - See you in a couple days, okay? - Okay. Bye, sweetheart. Thanks for taking them. I just... I need a couple days. Hey. Whenever you're ready, we'll see you at home. Okay? Hey, guys. Mama missed you so much. - I love you. - I love you, too. Okay. Come here. All my life, I've defined myself through sports. What I could accomplish, how many games I could win. And I've always come up empty. It's never been enough. Like I was meant for somethin' else. Somethin' more. What if it's this? What if it's us? Together? Everything I could ever want or need is right here. It doesn't matter if I play football, or if I don't play football, or if I do play football, where I play football. None of that matters. 'Cause winning isn't winning if I don't have you by my side. I've made my choice. I love you. And I want what you have. I want your faith, I want your strength, I want it all. I need it. I need it in my life. It makes me a better man. Yes. You gotta wait till I say the words first. Well, then, hurry up. God! - Brenda Carney... - Yes! - You're not gonna let me finish? - No! Ladies and gentlemen, on the first day of the rest of their lives, Mr. and Mrs. Kurt and Brenda Warner. Come on! Come on! Hey, Warner. We got Arena Bowl this weekend. Arena Bowl. Are you all in? Let's do it. Wow. This right here, this is my "all in." I love you. Daddy, will you dance with me? Aw... Yeah. ♪ It was no accident ♪ Me finding you, Daddy ♪ Someone had a hand in it ♪ It's okay. After 4 months and 16 games, it has come down to this. A barn dance in Des Moines. And they are rockin' and rollin' here at the Veterans Auditorium in Des Moines. The defending champions Tampa Bay Storm against the Iowa Barnstormers. Hello, everyone. Along with Kirk Herbstreit, I am Todd Christensen. Hey, Todd, Kirk. Cleveland Stadium has a Dawg Pound. Veteran Memorial Stadium has the Barnyard... Let's keep this area for the "different" people. Whoo! Hurry up, hurry up! The outcome. Hear the momentum switching to Iowa here as they drive for a go-ahead score... Twenty-sixth completion by Kurt Warner, that too is an Arena Bowl record. Warner, the ball is tipped. The keeper is out of the length of catch. Yes! Come on, come on! Hurry up. Let's go. If you don't keep contain on this guy, he's gonna hurt ya. If they want a championship, this is where they have to earn it. Don't hold it. - He cocks and motions left... - Throw. Throw. Pump fakes, is able to buy some time. He gets rid of it. And it appears... No! A little pressure right in the face of Kurt Warner and who would've thought, that on the one-yard line that they couldn't get it in? And they're gonna look back at that, you can see the pressure applied there... It's okay, we'll be fine. The Tampa Bay Storm are the champions. - Thanks. - There you go. Oh, my pleasure. Thanks for coming out. Sorry we didn't win. Kurt? Hey, Kurt? Excuse us, Brenda. There's a gentleman here to see you. - Hey, do you want me to go? - No, stay here, that's fine. Heck of a game for you, Kurt. Well, thank you, but it didn't help us win. I hate to lose, sir. I hate it for the team. I'm David Gillis. We've been trying to reach you. We want you to come and try out for us. Try out? I've been putting off his calls for a while. Can you blame me? I'm sorry, who are you? I'm with the Rams. Dick, come on. Dick, I mean... I don't get it. I like him. - It's a hunch. - It's arena football. You think that'll translate? Character translates anywhere, Mike. GM sure likes his price. Our groundskeeper's gonna make more than him this season. John, this guy is old. Slow as molasses. And frankly, he's beneath the standards of this franchise. That's what people said about me when I came here. He got a howitzer for a right arm, though. There is no way this guy makes the team. No way. I like him. Split! Through one. All right, next group, let's go. Set, hut! Great way to sling it, Trent. Good boy. The Packers called you up once. Yes, sir. A long time ago. Ah. How long did you last? Not long enough. Two days. You lasted two days. Don't get too comfortable. All we're lookin' for, gentlemen, is perfection. Let's see how we did with Trent Green on the C map. One, two, three, four, five. Step and throw. Very nice. Stop. Now, Is, you know why he put that ball right there, right? That's to keep you from gettin' hit. That's to protect you. Very good. Excellent ball placement. Stop, stop. Torry, no. You know that dig is 15 in cut. Not 14. Right? 15. Don't mind Coach Martz. Let me know if you need anything. I'm Isaac. Yeah. Yeah, man, I know who you are. I'm Kurt. It's a pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hey, Mike. Have you put in 1-3 yet? You wanna waste everybody's time? All right, second group, let's go. Pop Warner, that's you, let's go. All right, let's see some happy feet. Okay, let's watch Kurt Warner. How close to perfection could we get this time? Step, throw, stop. It's a wrong read. It's a wrong damn read! You're ahead of 'em. You gotta hit 'em in stride, Kurt. Yes, sir. "Yes, sir," with a grin. Why the grin? I don't know, Coach. I was just... I was curious as to why everybody here in the NFL moves so slow. Gentlemen, I believe arena boy just called every one of you slow. So, we gonna end on that. And on this, which is for Warner, when he learns to throw a spiral. Mr. Trent Green. You can break 'em down and take 'em out. Good night, gentlemen. Ride it out, rook. It's all part of the plan. Ready? C-57! C-57! Blue 80! Blue 80. Give me that ball. Give me the ball. What are you thinking? How do you drop that? That ain't on the QB, Coach. That man is risking his life for you every snap! And you don't have the dignity to hold on to the damn ball? You hold on to this ball. Yes, sir. That's my mistake. It won't happen again. All right, let's run it again. We good. I don't know, Brenda, I don't think I'm gonna be here much longer. How do you know that? The offensive coordinator hates me. I can't prove myself. He won't let me. I'm not gettin' any snaps. - Hates you? - Yeah, no, he hates me. I mean, this is Trent Green's team, anyway. They built it around him and he's incredible. Babe, hang in there. Hey, Warner, Coach wants to see you upstairs. - I gotta go. - I love you. I love you, too. - You wanted to see me, sir? - Oh. Yes. How long for you in the wilderness, son? How long out of college? Right. Well, yeah, I mean, it's, uh... it's been a few years. Wow. But, sir, that doesn't mean that I don't know how... Fourteen. For me. Fourteen years outta coaching. I burnt out. I'm not embarrassed to say it. Took a year off, turned out to be a decade and a half. And when I did come back, they said I was a retread, has-been, too old. Game had passed me by, all that stuff. All that same stuff that they're gonna say about you. What they didn't know... was all that experience that I had in those years made me who I am. Made me ready for this moment. Gave me something others didn't have. And I see that in you, Kurt. Destiny. It belongs to the underdogs. You wanna prove that? Together? There's somethin' special about you, son. And I'm really gonna enjoy finding out what that is. Welcome to the Rams. Come on. Come on! Oh, my gosh! Oh, Coach, thank you. Thank you for trusting me. I gotta tell my wife. I gotta tell my wife. This is the best decision you've ever made in your life. I promise you. I gotta go tell my wife. Guys, I'm home. Zack? Zack, honey, no! No, no, no! Hey, baby, baby, Brenda, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, come here. Sit with me. Sit down. Why would you let him do that? He said he was ready. And I believed him. Mom, I'm driving! Yeah, you are, bud! Come on, Charles! Trent Green, ninth-rated passer with 81.8% quarterback rating in 1998, the real hope for this offense. We've been talking about him all game and all through season long... Hey, check it out. That's my boy. This might be the only screen time he gets, though. Boy, shut up. ...to number 18, Tony Small, the rookie's... - Whoa! - We have a scorer. Freddie Miller is a bad man. Freddie Miller's a bad man. Now, we got Trent Green down. We've got Trent Green down in the middle of the field. This is not the way I saw this. And Green went down hard and is not getting up. And that looks bad. ...writhing in pain, you do not wanna see this. If you're the Rams, or anybody, for that matter. He was in a lot of pain and you hate to see that after a player gets you by the knees from behind. Son of a... And Isaac Bruce is obviously upset about it as well. He should have been penalized. Kurt Warner, now warming up on the sideline for the Rams. Kurt Warner, a capable back-up. Oh, my God. Certainly not where Trent Green is. To an exciting night for us here at ESPN, an exciting night for the NFL. So obviously, lots of buzz coming out this morning here from Rams' camp and the question today is "Why not Kurt Warner?" Why not Kurt Warner? Really? You just said that? Kurt Warner replaced Trent Green as the starting quarterback. This ain't the guy. The Rams are gonna trade for a quality starting quarterback. They can't wait. They've gotta do it right now. If Dick Vermeil stays with this guy, he's gonna be a joke. Their program is a joke. The season's over. Come in. - Sit down. - Thank you, Coach, I prefer to stand. All right. Go ahead, then. Tell me. Tell you what? Why a team worth $800 million with one of the most complex offenses ever built, by me, should put you in the driver's seat. Because you threw some touchdowns on a little football arena? Hmm? You're too old to be a rookie. You're too green to be a pro, you don't belong here. Well, with all due respect, sir, you're wrong. And if you give me a chance, I will prove that to you. Make us a laughingstock of the league? Embarrass every member of this team, - every fan of the city? - That's not true. You don't have what it takes. That's what I believe. So, why in the world would I give you this shot? Because this is my time, sir. Because I know who I am, and I know why I'm here. Because I've earned it. I've waited for it, I've bled for it. And... I'm finally ready for it. I wasn't before. God knows I wasn't, but I am now. And I will not let you down. You put the ball in my hands, and we will win. That's all, Kurt. - Hello? - Hey, Coach. He's ready. People asked me last night how I felt in that press conference. It hurts. I get emotional. But that's what this business is all about. We will rally around Kurt Warner. And we will play good football. CBS is proud to present the National Football League. Today, we come to you from St. Louis, Missouri, Gateway to the West. The Trans World Dome where the Ravens and St. Louis Rams are set to go at it. It's kick-off 1999. Opening Day in the National Football League. I do like a man in uniform. Jeez... What are you... How did you get in here? I, uh... I needed you to hear this before you went out on that field. I was talking with our son, and I helped him write it. "To my daddy, Kurt. "You fix all my radios. "You walk to the gas station in the snow. "You never give up on me. "You never give up. "You play your football game. I drive my truck. "Love, Zack." That little boy has defied all odds. Every time. He's proven everyone wrong. And so will you. You helped me believe again. That anything can happen. That maybe God does have something amazing in store for us. Maybe that moment's now. Are you nervous? Yeah, I'm terrified. Well, you go out there, and you show the world what I've known all along. Sell-out crowd. Over 66,000 expected here at the TWA Dome. This is the opportunity of a lifetime for this young man. A lot of pressure on the shoulders of Number 13. If he doesn't perform well today, the Cinderella story could be over before it even gets started. The 1999 season underway... It is on the end-zone... Ready for this, son? Yes, sir. And the Rams with their new quarterback, Kurt Warner, replaced Trent Green as the starting quarterback. Good, good. Take a look at the Ravens' defensive lead, Ray Lewis is the All-Pro... All mine now, rook. All mine. All right, boys. Launch left, 36 alpha. On one. Ready! Z-4-2! Easy. I'm here, rook. Hey, I'm here. You get nothing. This is my house. My house! Now, we're ready to get goin'. First down and 10 for the Rams - from the 42 yard line. - Blue 80! Hut! Let's go! Faulk taken down at the 40. Ray Lewis got there... Let's go, let's go! Let's go, let's go! All right, I'm ready. I see you. I see you. I see you, rook. I see you, rook. Blue 80. Blue 80, hut! And Warner ripped down by, guess who? Ray Lewis. It didn't take much of a guess for those people who know Ray Lewis... This is just another game of "Kill Kurt." Let's go. Let's go! Let's go! They talked about blitzing this young quarterback early. Ray Lewis coming in untouched. The Rams need to give Kurt Warner some time today - for him to be able... - Ten for two! - ...those weapons down field. - Black nine! Black nine, hut! Warner steps up in the pocket. Caught! Isaac Bruce. Yes! At the front and you love to see that... Hey! Yeah! I taught him that, now. One-eighty! One-eighty, hut! Warner... Let's go, huddle. Hey, let's go, huddle. Let's huddle. Let's huddle right now. Mike, what have we got? Right slot, fake 28, power double seam. - On one. Ready? - Four-twenty-one. Ready? Come on! Let's go, guys. Let's go. And Kurt Warner, so far, very nice job, stayin' within himself... 52's the Mike. 52's the Mike. 52! Green, 60, hut! Warner. Intercepted by Ray Lewis. And he's gotta beat the quarterback down the sideline. Cuts it in. Lewis still running. Ray Lewis all the way down inside the 35. Warner finally makes a mistake. All day long, rook. Eatin' you for lunch all day long. Shake that off. You got this. Hey, Warner, Coach Martz wants to talk to you. Yeah, Coach? Kurt, listen to me. You know why I was so hard on you? Why I put all that pressure on you? I had to know that you were ready. Had to be sure. And guess what? You are. I never would've put you on that field if I didn't fully believe you were a champion. Now, you get back out there and you get this job done. Let's go. Let's get after it. Yes, sir. And, Coach? Thank you. And the Rams are in business. A 34-yard return. Huddle. Look at me. You can do this. I know you can. Yeah. We got your back, no matter what happens. Let's go to work. Let's go to work. All right. That last one was on me. But we got this. Let's get to work. Right doubles, grip, 50 sail. On one, ready! C-4 Rams! You got this. And this young man, Kurt Warner, he played in the Arena League in Iowa. Green, 60, hut! That's it! Let's give 'em a confidence play. What do you say? - Get him settled in. - All right. Let's throw this at him. Black, nine, hut! Throws to 10... And it's Isaac Bruce. Here's the back. Right there, Kurt. Good call, good call! Warner, under pressure, dances out of the pocket, and... That's my boy! Look at that composure from Kurt Warner. - Come on, Kurt! - He's hot. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it. Wide 20. Wide 20, hut! Warner. Corner of the end zone! Roland Williams! Touchdown! Yes! And Kurt Warner six of ten 74 yards, throws his first NFL touchdown. See that? I taught him that. Come on, 1-3, show me some... Have some faith. ...their own 30-yard line. Play-action, Warner sets up tee... Fires at the sidelines, Isaac Bruce makes the catch... Oh, yeah! Come on, come on, come on. Three, hut! Look at Ray Lewis chasing his tail. Switch it! No. Abort, abort, abort! Oh, you're gonna love this. Blue, 20, hut! Shovel pass. Hakim. Dodged. When was the last time you saw shovel pass to a wide receiver like that? This kid can play! Three-fifty! Three-fifty, hut! Warner again, in the end zone... Touchdown! Well, Bruce! Twenty yards. What a show! What a show! I have never been so happy to have been proven so wrong. I mean, you're watching a star being born. This is a day that we will not forget. Ravens falling apart offensively right now. - Wow. - Mitchell. Come on. Pump fake. All right. Intercepted! Huge. Running down the clock, there's only four and a half minutes left in this game. - Four more minutes, baby. - I don't want this game to end, gentlemen. Hey, left, cross, split, 50-F, follow on one, ready! Kurt Warner. And he throws. Marshall Faulk out of the back field. And there he goes. Look at this. Making people miss inside the 21-yard line. We got 'em on the ropes! We're gonna punch this in, right now. Left, close, red, X, laser. On one, ready. And Kurt Warner, he's confident. Because he certainly has something to prove. Blue 80, hut! Perfect. Great catch! Touchdown! The rookie! Yeah! And what a job by that young man there. Kurt Warner is like Magic Johnson today. Look at all the assists. You got it done. He's partying right now. That's because the Rams gave complete control of this football game... Warner! Warner! Warner! Dick Vermeil. The old coach has to smile after this one because they're happy in St. Louis. And that should do it. One more kneel-down by the Rams. And the first win is in the books. My gosh. Blue, 80, hut! Thank you. Thank you. Look at him! That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, that's my guy! We did it! We did it. Man, you keep that game ball. You earned it. I will. Kurt! Kurt! Kurt! Hey, good game, bro. Hey, that means a heck of a lot comin' from you. - No problem. - It really does. Brenda! Great game, boys. Great game, boys. Well done. It was a beautiful thing to watch. - Thank you for believing in me, Coach. - Well done. Thank you. Brenda! Hey! Baby. Hey. Hey, I don't know where we go from here, I don't know what comes next. But this? We did this. We did this together. I love you. I love you, too. We did it! One-eighty! Kurt Warner has brought hope back to St. Louis. The first quarterback in the history of the NFL to throw three touchdown passes in each of his first three starts. Here they come again. Forget Ringling Brothers. The Rams are the greatest show on Earth. Kurt Warner, out of the Arena League and as a back-up when the season began, became the league's MVP. A phenomenal and unbelievable story. Just remember, this guy here, he was bagging groceries at the Hy-Vee five years ago. So, he goes from the Hy-Vee to the MVP.
