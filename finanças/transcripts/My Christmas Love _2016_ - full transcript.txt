Hey! Cynthia, you're back so soon. - I love that necklace. - Oh, thank you. It's an early Christmas present from myself. - Good for you. - Your usual booth? - I'll take that for you. - Thank you so much. Toni has made some wonderful chocolate-almond croissants-- - Oh, yeah? - And there you go. You know what I want. But I'll take two. Are you back on the market? I actually have a date, and he's on his way here. Oh, good. It's just that last time when you ate up.. Never mind. Two chocolate delights coming right up. Thank you. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] [sighs] - New suit? - I'm sorry? No, I.. I was just asking if it was a new suit 'cause you got the.. Oh-h, boy! Thanks. Do you mind if I see the ring? [chuckles] Is it that obvious? No, it's.. Yeah. [chuckles] Oh, my gosh, it's so pretty. You have to relax, she's definitely gonna say yes. If I can ask her. This is the third time I've brought it with me. You know what? I have an idea. Why don't we switch tables? 'Cause this one's way more romantic. - Are.. Are you serious? - Yeah, no problem. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Keep it up, tiger. - Yeah. It's fine. [laughs] [door slams] Cynthia! - Oh, hey, sweetie. - Hi, how are you? Good. How do you look so handsome? - Thank you. No booth? - No, not tonight. But trust me, it's for a very good cause. Okay. Thank you. You know, people typically have dinner first and then dessert? [chuckling] Happy anniversary by the way. "Anniversary?" No, it's just five months together. Actually, um, I got you something. Oh, my gosh I was totally kidding about the anniversary. Not the anniversary. It's actually just a Christmas present. That's so sweet. But bring it with us to the farm. I wanna open it closer to Christmas. Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that. - I'm just not sure about.. - Th-the trip? Us. [instrumental music] Oh. You're great. - You're better than great. - Yeah. It's just that two weeks with your family for Christmas.. - Totally. - It's.. I've...heard it before. - Cynthia-- - It's fine. - Don't.. - You're good. I just wanted say, you guys are such a beautiful couple and I hope you have a really great night. You know what, I'm gonna have a cupcake. And you know what, it's supposed to snow, so I don't have any canned food. Oh, and.. 'Night. Merry Christmas. [instrumental music] Careful, Paul, I wouldn't want you hurtin' them precious fingers of yours. Oh, they weren't so precious when I was laying you out. And what've you done since, sat around drawin' bunny rabbits 'in those Felicia Flowers books.' [laughs] You jealous? I drive a forklift, of course I'm jealous. Whoo. [laughing] Yeah-ha-ha! Good. Okay. Alright, my phone's ringin', my phone's ringin'. [cell phone ringing] Alright, give me a sec, it's my boss. [Liam sighs] It's not even 8 o'clock yet. What happened? Take a little guess here. Christmas, my family, the farm the travel, everything, my sister's wedding. - He bailed out. - Hmm. Well, you know, at least you got a gift out of it. What's the matter? He couldn't wait till Christmas? What was he thinking with these, like "Here you go, here's a present like, in case you forget you got dumped." [sighs] - You okay? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm good. I'm, I'm great, you know. If he can't handle me then, what good is he, right? Mm. Look, the right guy, he's out there somewhere. I want it to work out. I have to say though, I do have pretty high expectations. My parents, they do.. They, they did...so many sweet.. ...and/or lot of romantic things for one another. So, um.. What are you gonna tell Janet? - She's expecting a plus one. - I'll bring in a plus one. I'm not going stag to my little sister's wedding. - Anyone I know? - You might. You are so lucky that I did not have plans. You're lucky, you get to spend two wonderful weeks with me. Besides we do have a deadline on the book. It's the first Christmas since you're mom passed away. You sure I'm not gonna be in the way? My dad loves the company, the more, the merrier. Besides, you cannot be alone on Christmas. I...wasn't gonna be alone. - Mm-hmm. - Necessarily. (Cynthia) Uh-huh? You know, I date, alright. There was Maggie. I'm talkin' about someone in the past decade. You know, I don't tell you everything. [chuckles] I would know if you were seeing someone. - Oh, you would, would you? - You'd be happier. You'd have a little pep in your step. [chuckling] Oh, yeah. At least you haven't screwed up, literally five relationships in two years. - R-R-Ronaldo. - No! Stop! [Liam laughs] - He doesn't count. - Why not? 'Cause I can't handle two hands. [laughs] Let's go. [instrumental music] (Cynthia) 'You know what, I need this. Two weeks, no drama.' 'Like, we'll finish the new book, spend time with my dad' 'get Janet married, and start the new year fresh.' You'll see, everything is gonna be so perfect. [siren wailing] (Cynthia) 'It gets dirty right after this.' (Liam) 'You weren't going that fast, were you, Cynthia?' Don't really think that's why I'm gettin' pulled over. [sighs] [instrumental music] Well, well, well, what do we have here? Hey, Scott. I'm so sorry. Was I, was I speeding or something? What? Oh, who knows. Radar gun's been busted since July. - Just wanted to say hi. - Hi. Hello. Ha ha. It's good to have you back, Cindy. It's great to be back. Hey, who's this? - You married now? - No, no. He's my working.. He's my work friend. He's my friend. We wo.. I work with him. - Ah. - Liam. Hi. - I draw pictures. - Mm-hmm. I'm gonna need to see some ID, stranger. - I'm just kidding. Ha ha ha. - Oh. 'You'd be surprised how people fall for that though.' - Probably because you're a cop. - Yeah. This has just been so fun. Um, but we, we actually have to head out and, uh, go meet up with my family. Oh, you're right. Right, yeah. You know I saw Janet the other day. She said you'd be comin' into town to, uh.. How'd she put it? - Screw up the wedding? - Yeah, that sounds about right. She, uh, gets a little annoyed with my enthusiasm for weddings. 'Yeah, it's gonna be, it's gonna be great.' 'I can't wait for you to see it.' Yeah. Alright, well, um.. We should, uh, get together. You know, hang out. Catch up, maybe grab a coffee or somethin'. Yeah, that would be.. I'm so busy, but...that would be great. That would be great, yeah. Okay. Well, uh...drive safe. Okay. See you later, officer. - Bye. - See ya. I thought small town cops were supposed to be paunchy. Is he like, your ex-boyfriend? No, he's my first boyfriend actually. But he would always like wanna re-watch his football games from the night before. And yet you still let him call you Cindy. - Ha ha. The guy has a taser. - Fair enough. [instrumental music] Whoa-ha-ha-ha, wow! - This is a nice place. - It's great. It's just there's usually so many more lights. - We could take care of that. - Yeah. I'm gonna go tell my dad we're here. So just go inside, I'm sure Janet's there. Ha. Janet. [bells chiming] Dad! Dad! [Cynthia laughs] You're the best. Thank you so much for doing that. Liam! Why didn't you go inside? Uh, well, you said that, uh, Janet was in there. - Oh, gosh, you're such a baby. - Yeah. Well, you know, Janet's, uh, Janet's awesome but, uh, scary sometimes. - Uh, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - You're just a baby. - Yeah, I'm a baby. [Liam chuckles] You got that? You good? Oh, yeah, don't worry about me. I got it. Oh, you're strong. You've been workin' out? Yeah. Big time. This is gonna look so good! - Hello. - On the fourth at noon.. Hi! (Cynthia) Hi! Get over here. Oh, my gosh! - Hi! Merry Christmas! - Hi! - Oh! - Oh! So good to see you. - Cynthia, good to see you. - Roger! Oh, my gosh. Merry Christmas. Get over here. Welcome to the fam. Well, there's still almost two weeks, technically. We all thought you were gonna bring a date? - 'I was.' - Hi, Janet. - Hi, Liam. - I am. Liam...can be my date. Yeah, mostly just here to do work, you know. Always another deadline. - Hey! Liam. - Roger. What happened to Jake? Did you drive him away? His name is Jason, and no, I do not drive men away. I have a very romantic nature that some men find-- - Overwhelming? - Terrifying? Intense. Anyway, Roger, Liam here is an amazing illustrator. 'He draws my Felicia Flowers books.' Oh. Your illustrations are amusing. Yeah, you know, I don't know where Cynthia finds the inspiration for that. Write what you know, right? Um, anyway, how's dad? Oh, he-he's good, he's okay. I'm a little worried about how he's gonna do when I move in with Roger. Yeah, totally, but I guess all we can do right now is just try to give him a great Christmas, right? Yeah. Anyway, speaking of, where's the tree and the decorations and everything? Haven't had time with the wedding and everything. I think this year we'll just forget all that. (Cynthia) 'What are you talking about?' We have a giant tree every year, amazing decorations. This is gonna be no exception, okay? It's a long standing tradition in our house and one that I intend to keep. - Sounds like my girl. - Daddy! - Oh, hi! - Oh. It's good to have you home. Just wouldn't be Christmas without you. I know, I know. I just.. Oh, I miss you. I was, um, I was just in the barn and it looks like we're a little behind schedule. Oh, uh, no. I'll get around to it. We still have nearly two weeks left. And you're my maid of honor not my wedding planner, and we got this! Okay, okay, I'm just sayin' we're a little behind sched, that's all. 'Dad, you remember Liam, right?' - Yeah. Good to see you. - How are you, sir? Didn't realize you two were dating. Oh, I, uh.. We're, we're, uh.. We're not. Yeah, he's just gonna be my date to the wedding as a platonic-friendy kind of date, situation. - 'Cause she blew it with Jake. - Jason. Could I help you both get settled in? Aw, you're so sweet, Roger but I think we're just gonna drop our bags. - Then we're gonna get a tree! - Cynthia-- No! We're getting a tree, it's gonna be big! It's gonna be opulent, it's gonna be gorgeous and I'm gonna clean up all the pine needles. - Oh! - I love you. I'm glad you're here. Oh, dad. - It is so good to be home! - Oh, it's great to have you. Okay, I'll be right back! But if you do get any designs on my daughter just keep this in mind.. I'm a hunter. A good one. Good to know. He gives me that speech every day. How did you get over here so fast, man? (Cynthia) Alright. Our last stop. Ooh. Great, let's grab a wreath and get back to the farm.. We're not just grabbin' a wreath. It's how I do things, okay, I gotta, like find the perfect wreath, takes a little bit.. Oh, yeah, of course. Silly me. (Cynthia) Oh! Looks at these berries, look how pretty they look. Oh, well, well, well. I was wonderin' when you'd show up. - Grant! - Ha ha ha! Oh, man, hi! Oh, Cynthia, wow! Look at you. You haven't aged a day. Oh, stop. What are you doing here? Well, I heard you were coming home, I figured you'd show up here, eventually. Aw! You were pre-stalking me? Well, technically, I'm here to oversee the fundraiser. Great cover story. Whatever. Ha ha. Um.. Grant, I want you to meet my friend Liam. - Oh, hi. - Liam, this is Grant. Grant and I, actually used to date in...high school. - Another one. - Ah, senior year. - So, are you two-- - No, no, no. - We're just, we're friends. - Yeah. Okay. Oh, but I gotta find the perfect wreath. I feel like you're definitely the person to talk to. Oh, well, let me show you to our private reserve. [Cynthia chuckles] Oh, this is great! Why do you keep all these under here? Uh, well, every year, the best ones get snatched up right away and inevitably, five minutes before closing some hardworking, single mom pops in and has to pick through the scraps, so I keep a few underneath. Figured if anybody deserves a good wreath, it's them, right? - Aww. - How did we ever break up? It's crazy. [indistinct chatter] Well, you know, they all look, uh, look the same to me. S-o-o, let's get back. Not this one. It's not all about looks. Ah! This is the one. It smells like Christmas! - Perfect. - I love it. Aww. - You haven't changed a bit. - Oh. - You too. - Ha ha. [instrumental music] [Janet yawns] Hey, cutie! - Hi. - You, uh, did you sleep well? I did, actually. Yeah. How long have you been up for? [chuckles] Well, just a few hours. I checked the cookie jar, and then I checked the spare jar and then there was nothin'! You know you could just go to the store and buy cookies. If you go to the store and buy cookies it lacks a certain presentation. [instrumental music] That is true, I'll give you that. 'It's good, right?' - It's good. - Wow. So what's the plan for today? Are we gonna meet a few more of your ex-boyfriends? Ha ha ha. It's a small town, okay? [instrumental music] I mean, just 'cause I've dated a few guys.. [instrumental music] [doorbell rings] I'll get it. The-there's milk there if you want it. [partridge chirping] Hi. [instrumental music] ♪ On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me ♪ ♪ A partridge in a pear tree Oh, my gosh, that was so good. Oh, hey? Can you just give me a little more information? Um, is this for me? [door opens] Do you have a business card? [car engine revving] [partridge chirping] - Is that what I think it is? - This is a present. Isn't this the most fantastic thing ever? Yeah, who's it from? Okay, it says, "Merry Christmas to my one true love." That's all it says? It doesn't have a name? This is a Christmas mystery. This is the most romantic thing ever. This is a Christ-ery. [partridge chirping] Where're you gonna plant a pear tree in your apartment? Okay, it's not supposed to be practical, Janet. It's a grand, romantic gesture. - Well, too bad it's anonymous. - It's not anonymous. It's not anonymous at all, my.. ♪ True love gave it to me Stop singing, you're a loon. What is wrong with you? - I'm excited! - Oh, my goodness, I love you. I've to go plan a wedding, and sell a house. Okay. Alright. Aww, who's the prettiest bird? Are you a pretty bird? Are you a pretty bird? So how do you know that this is for you? 'I mean, Janet's the one gettin' married.' Janet is marrying her accountant. Trust me. It's not for Janet. Roger.. This is not his style. - I'm gonna ask him anyway. - 'What?' - Don't worry, I'll be subtle. - 'No.' Roger is very awkward. He just.. 'Yeah, please don't. He gets uncomfortable.' Let's take this, um, upstairs and find him a home, okay? And we've really got to get to work. I know. I'll go grab my sketchbook. Well, no, no, not that kind of work. ♪ But when the sleigh bells jingle ♪ ♪ I'm reminded that I'm single ♪ A tradition I won't celebrate ♪ ♪ Oh the weather's gettin' colder ♪ ♪ And I'm only growin' older ♪ But this holiday I lost my cheer ♪ ♪ It's hard to be jolly when you're not here ♪ ♪ The big guy's at least got eight reindeer ♪ ♪ I know I've been naughty can't hide my flaws ♪ ♪ And I'm still missin' my Mrs. Claus ♪ ♪ Christmas.. You did so good. [chuckling] Alright. You're right. This is really beautiful. - This was a good idea. - I'm glad you like it. Yup, Marie would be proud. [chuckles] It's the best tree we've had in years. I don't know, I kinda feel like my favorite is still the one that lost all of its needles. Okay, in my defense, eight-year-olds don't know that you know, Christmas trees don't drink eggnog. On that note, I think I'll say goodnight. Oh, you're the best. Goodnight, daddy. So, Rodge, Christmas wedding. I mean, that's, that's pretty romantic, right? Oh, really, it's the only sensible choice. People have the day off, families are already together. And bridal registries make gift shopping very convenient. - Convenient. - Hmm. - Smooth, huh. - Yeah, okay. - So it's not Roger. - Told you so. Yeah, you did. [instrumental music] - 'Okay, this isn't a studio.' - 'Ha ha ha.' But at least.. Ha! Okay. Well, now we can get some work done. We have a Christmas book to write. This is new territory for us. Right? This is new territory for Felicia. What does her magic do to Christmas? What does her magic do to Christmas? Here are some Christmasy things. Oh, oh, oh, maybe, um maybe the eggnog is served out of.. ...you know, really big tulips. Right? That would be really pretty I think. And the tree has, like, uh, a crystal, uh, pine cone that acts like a disco ball. Yes. Oh, that's gorgeous! I love that. Oh, my gosh, Liam. It's the cutest thing I've ever seen. Maybe the toys come alive at night and they re-decorate the entire house. Hmm? Oh, and there has to be tinsel on everything that's really important and blinking lights, all of it. It's gonna be gorgeous. Okay, okay, slow down, slow down-- No, no, you need to draw faster, I'm on a roll. Oh-ho, maybe the, um, maybe the toys think that she is a doll so they wrap her up in wrappin' paper. Well, can't she just rip her way out? No, she's gonna be tied up with ribbons, so she can't get up. You know.. Oh! And then she sees an elf in the fireplace. [instrumental music] [chuckles] Wow. Wow. I, uh.. This was my mom's. It was way too big for me when I was a kid. When I was growing up, I used to put it on.. ...and think about my perfect wedding, perfect romance perfect husband. Ha! Well, at least now you're past all that Pine Sky stuff. You can make fun of me all you want. But when I was growing up all I ever really wanted was the kind of romance my mom and dad had, you know? They were married for forty years and they still did all these.. Planned little surprises for each other. [chuckles] I mean.. They were the real deal. [inhales deeply] Hey, I-I'm really sorry. - Oh! God.. - 'Yeah, I-I didn't mean to..' No, I'm so sorry, I'm so embarrassed. - Hey, it's okay, it's okay. - Um.. - I just, I got nostalgic. - Yeah. - So, uh, book. - Yes! [sighs] Oh, w-we have such a deadline. We have a crazy deadline! Okay, I'm gonna, um.. I-If you don't mind I just wanna go show this to Janet. But I'll be right back. I think she'll love this. - Okay. - I'll be back. I'm gonna bring coffee. So, get! I gave you a lot of things to work on. So, go. - Okay. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Janet! - 'Uh-huh?' - Hi. - Hi. Look what I found. You're never gonna guess where it was. Upstairs in the closet, in a box marked "Mom's wedding gown?" Okay. Yeah, yeah, maybe you'll guess exactly where it was. [chuckling] It's all in the inventory. You gotta get that to the dry cleaners. You can't go wearing a dusty gown. No, Cynthia, I already, I already have a dress. You bought a gown without me there to advice you? No, I picked out a dress. It's sensible, you know, it's, it's great. Somethin' that I can wear again to, like, parties and stuff. What? What do you mean wear it to parties? A wedding dress is meant to be worn one time, that's the whole point of it. Well, mom already wore it once, so, there you go. Wow. Wow. If she could hear you say that she would.. [instrumental music] I'm not gonna wear mom's dress, okay? I'm just.. I'm not.. [sighs] I'm not ready. Come here. I understand, but.. I think you should think about it. - It's really pretty. - I hid it. - I love you. - I love you. - Hold on. - Okay. [instrumental music] ♪ On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me ♪ ♪ Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree ♪♪ [squeals] It's for me? Thank you. Oh, my gosh, that was pretty. No information. Okay. Hi, guys. Hi. [squeals] Janet! Liam! You guys, this is huge! This is huge! Look. Look. Look, Liam, two turtle doves. Isn't this exciting? This isn't just one present, I think it's gonna keep happening. Well, so, how exactly are they turtled? No, not turtled, turtle. Turtle. 'Cause...they eat...turtles. They look like.. I don't know, someone named them that! Isn't this exciting? They're so cute! Yeah. Uh, so, still no idea who's behind all this? No name, no nothing, it's so romantic. I don't get the point of these presents if no one's taking the credit for it. Janet, it's not about the presents. I mean, it's about the romance. Whoever is doing this is leaving me a serious trail of bread crumbs, and I'm gonna find them. [instrumental music] [Cynthia sighs] Shouldn't you be dragging Liam along on this? He has sketches to do. He didn't have to come up to the farm to draw pictures. He could have done that back in the city. Yeah, but, dad, then he'd miss Christmas. - Come on. - Oh-ho. What are you laughin' at? You...remind me of your mother. One whiff of romance, and you're off to the races. - Must be genetic, huh? - Hmm. [bell chiming] - Esther! Hi! - 'Merry Christmas.' Okay, I got a very important question. Two turtle doves and a partridge I need to know who bought 'em. It's nice to see you too. And Tom. What a surprise. It's been a long time. - Hi, Esther. How's things? - I can't complain. Who would listen if I did? [laughing] Okay. I'm sorry, what were you saying? Just two turtle doves one partridge, need to know who bought 'em. Well, I sold plenty of turtles, no doves. 'I just carry parakeets, inches from time to time.' Okay, so then where would someone like, buy birds like that? One of those specialty shops in the city, I suppose. Why? - Because somebody is giving-- - 'Good morning, citizens.' Hey, Scott. - Hi. - Hey. Um, I'm to put up the flyers, do you mind? - For the carnival? - Yeah. - Go ahead, go ahead. - Alright. (Esther) 'There you go.' [chuckles] So what're you guys doin' here? - 'Pickin' up some bird seed?' - What? Why would.. What makes you say that? Bird seed. [laughs] Bird seed. Bird seed. Yes, we have, we own birds. - We have birds as pets. - Great! - Mm-hmm. - Great! Uh.. You are coming to the carnival, right? - Yeah. - Never miss it. Uh, well, I don't know. - 'Dad, come on.' - Okay. Tell you what. Tickets...are on me. You, Cindy, Janet, whoever. Now you don't have any excuses. Besides, you don't go, you're gonna hurt my feelings. That's really thoughtful, Scott, thank you. Alright. See you guys around. And take care of those birds. 'We will. Ha ha ha.' [door chime jingling] [instrumental music] [hens clucking] Hi, Liam, Joyeux Noel we've got three French hens in the house and a break in the case, so get your coat on. Come on, you heard the man. (Liam) 'Wait, wait, wait. I'm confused, start over.' Okay, so the local pet store does not carry turtle doves. Right? I called around, they don't have them anywhere 'cause they're not mated here, you actually have to get like, a special permit just to import them. - So? - So, check this out. Look at this website, "McPherson's special events." They have a permit, everything, it says they provide "Unique gifts and experiences for the special people in your life." Boom. I solved it, like, it has to be through this. How romantic! Look, whoever did this, they went through a lot of trouble. So don't you think you're like, kinda ruinin' the surprise? Whoever did this, clearly wants me to figure it out 'cause they made it pretty easy. Hey, we're like a block away, be chill, be really tough here because they're not really expecting us to be 'who we are. That's all I'm saying.' Why is that? Cynthia, what did you tell them? Cynthia! [instrumental music] Ho, this is just a beautiful office. We have that same art in ours as well. Hello, Cynthia Maxwell, Fish and Wildlife Department. Nice to meet you, Miss Maxwell. I got your call, I think we can get this all straightened out. What seems to be the problem? Oh, we just have missing information on a turtle dove permit, no big deal. We just need to get that client's name fast we go, "hoo-hoo outta here," and just, go back to our office. I see, um, well, unfortunately I'm not gonna be able to give out any names without prior consent or a warrant. Liam. I'm the bad cop. Right. - I've, I've pulled your file. - Mm-hmm. And, uh, take a look at it. Unfortunately the client insists on complete confidentiality until the final delivery. Apparently, there's a letter that explains everything. What? I think we've taken enough of the good man's time. A letter? There's a letter? That would be helpful. Uh, frankly, I don't see what any of this has to do with fish or wildlife. The recipient, whoever that is 'is just going to have to be patient.' Okay, then, I will be...taking this. Oh, be my guest. They're for visitors. Then I'm gonna take.. ...this one too. - Nice work, Colombo. - Yeah, you didn't help at all. What do you want me to say? Bye. [instrumental music] Uh, let me guess, is it for calling birds? - Heh heh heh. Yes. - Yeah? Look, they're so cute. Look how real they look. Watch this. [birds chirping] They tweet. - Turn it off. - I'm with Janet. You need to make whoever's sending you these gifts stop. Why would I wanna make them stop? We're smack dab in the middle of the most romantic mystery since the Bermuda Triangle. What is romantic about that? - Um, hello, Bermuda. - 'Okay.' No, I don't get this whole situation and I don't like it, these gifts are strange. - I'm going to my cake tasting. - Okay. Oh, gosh, whoever has done this has really fogged this out, huh? Yeah, plus they must've known that you were coming to town. - Right? - That's true. Otherwise they would've sent it to the city. Mm-hmm. Oh...my gosh. I know exactly who it is. I feel so stupid. It's Grant. It's definitely Grant, he's suave he's handsome, even though that's irrelevant and do you remember how excited he was to see me the other day at the fundraiser like, I definitely could tell he was flirting with me. 'I didn't wanna say anything and sound cocky.' Yeah, well him? Really? That's, uh, that's the one you're landing on? It's definitely him. He loves Christmas. This is so his style. It's so sweet. Hm. So, how are you gonna prove it? Oh, I'm sure he's dying for me to find out so it's gonna be very easy to crack him. Just gonna go and see him and kinda, like, turn on my charm. [laughs] Charm? What charm? Why, I oughta.. Hmm. I'll never get used to this cold. I know and it's like a bitter cold. - Yeah. Just bites you. - Yeah, it bites. So, lemme know if they want any more of these 'cause my publisher just gave me a ton and they are...all over my guest room. Oh, publisher. Fancy. No, I can't thank you enough. Bill's kids are crazy about Felicia. How is Bill, anyway? Great. He and Shawn are, uh, in Miami now. Always loved your brother. He's the best. Okay, and smiley face. [laughs] Here you go. Thank you again. You have just made my niece's Christmas. No worries. There's nothing quite like getting a special gift from someone you love, right? Right. [instrumental music] (Scott) 'Afternoon.' Oh, well, howdy, officer? What brings you by? You, uh, tracking a fugitive? Ahh. More like a missing person. Cindy's always in a rush whenever I see her. Yeah, well, I'm afraid that your luck hasn't changed. She's, uh, hot on the trail of her secret admirer. - She's figured it out, has she? - So she thinks. [instrumental music] Nice. Thanks, it's, uh, just something I'm working on until she gets back from her date with Grant. - Grant? - 'Yeah.' [laughs] Well, that...should be interesting. Ugh. Christmas is hands down my favorite time of year. Oh, mine too. It's also a very important holiday. Mm-hmm. You want to know what I love most about it? What's that? It's the perfect time of the year for secret presents. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Grant, I.. I have a little confession to make. Okay. I know you've been sending me the presents. And I love it. [laughs] - Cindy, I, I thought you knew. - Hmm? More coffee, father? Uh, I think we're all set. Thank you. I guess not all the news makes it to the big city. - Wow. - Well.. [laughs] - Now, um, about the confession. - I'm good. - You sure? - Mm-hmm. [instrumental music] [engine rumbling] ♪ Five golden rings Hey, hey, finally something we don't have to feed. Wow, I think they're probably not real and also they don't fit you. Hey, getting a ring re-sized does not make it any less romantic, Janet. - Oh, must have coffee. - Good morning. If you need me, I'll be in the barn. That arch isn't gonna finish itself. - Thank you. - Love you, dad. So, now that you at last know about Father Grant 'who's the next candidate?' Father Grant. Well, so the, uh, suave, handsome ex-boyfriend who's been carrying a torch for you all these years is a priest? Oh, that's amazing. Well, at least we know why he loves Christmas so much. Liam, please, if that theory is so yesterday, we're moving on. Okay, now that we know it was not Grant who sent the presents, I think we know that it's Jason. - Scott. - Scott? - Who's Jason? - Jake. No. It would make more sense if it was Scott. He's Quechee's most eligible bachelor he looks very cute in a uniform-- No, it's definitely Jason. This was clearly all planned out. Okay, he gave me my present early the bird ornament, right? 'And him not showing up was just' clearly him, like, doing a fake out. It's just, it's scary how well this all fits together. Scary is one word for it. So, you're sure it's Jason? Um, yeah. Who else knows that I'm home? It's just.. He's just giving me this grand gesture. It all works out so perfectly. [instrumental music] [sighs] Okay. [knock on door] - Hey - Cynthia, hey. What are, what are you doing here? I got your presents. Oh! Oh! Okay, I gotta.. Hi. Cynthia...I'm sorry. [instrumental music] - Put your finger here. - Hm. Hold it down. - Mixed your marshmallows. - Ooh! Thank you. - Ba-ba-bum. - Thank you. So do you want to talk about it? - No. - Mm-hmm. Feel like such an idiot. You know I'm done chasing my own tail. I'll just.. I'm just gonna wait for the letter. Oh, yeah, that's, that's such a good idea. Wait. Who said that? Who, who, oh, that was, yeah, that was me. That was, yeah, that was smart. It's so obvious who your one true love is. The answer is literally right in front of your face. It is? Yes, Scott. Come on, he still thinks about you guys as, like, homecoming king and queen. - Don't start that again. - Perhaps. This is way out of Scott's league, trust me. (Janet) 'I don't know, people change.' [instrumental music] [Liam laughing] [Cynthia screaming] [indistinct chatter] - Ohh! - Hi! I'm sorry, I'm going to have to call you back 'cause I live with children. Hi, Janet, look, the next gift came. Six geese a-laying. Or for lying on. They're so soft. Look, it's like you're being hit by a cloud! Oh! (Liam) 'Uh-oh. Oh, have you mad her mad?' I know my sister. She does not get mad. What does she do? What does she do? - Say it. - Didn't mean that. No. No. What, from the side? How mean? I don't have one, it's not fair. Hey! Hey! - 'Oh, we're busted.' - Uh-oh. - Sorry, dad. - I think you forgot something. [Cynthia screaming] [Tom laughing] - Dad, dad, no. Dad, no. - Who's, who's? No, no, no, not me. Oh! Whoo! [instrumental music] Do you think Janet will like this? Oh, yeah, she's gonna love it. She'll bring it to all her open houses and fill it with, like, peppermints and butterscotts and all that. - Butterscotts? - Butterscotch? - You said "Scotts." - No, I didn't. Did I? - Yeah. - Gosh! I'm, I'm losing my mind. Well, uh, alright. Well, that covers the wedding. Now all I have to do is figure out what to get your pops. - What? - It's just really sweet. I pulled this whole trip on you very last minute and now you're gonna get a present for my dad. It's very thoughtful. Yeah, well, I guess this whole Christmas present craze is rubbing off on me. Well, if there's anybody else you need to shop for I'm totally fine just to go back in. - Yeah? Nah. - Poking my ears. - Already got something for you. - What? You did? - Ah. - Can you just give me a hint? - 'Nope.' - Okay. (Cynthia) 'So, do you think that maybe Janet could be-- ' - No. - You didn't let me finish. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Please, continue. Do you think that she could be right about Scott being the one behind the gifts? Oh, oh, in that case, uh, no. It'd be sort of cute. Wouldn't it? If we were, like, high school sweethearts that got back together after all these years apart. Yeah. Meh. It's not you sending the presents, right? You got me. [laughs] No, it's not. - Why would I do that? - I think I'm gonna call Scott. - Just, like...call him. - Yeah. [instrumental music] [doorbell rings] Coming! That's what I'm talking about. 7 Swans champagne. [all cheering] Finally, a gift I can get behind. - Swans swimming in champagne. - I know. Thanks, dad. - For you. - Alright. And moi. Alright. A toast. 'This is one that your mother used to make every year.' "To family. Past, present and future. May you forever be held in our hearts if not in our hands." - Cheers. - Cheers. [glass clinking] (Cynthia) Can you believe it Scott still has the same phone number? Oh, well you know, he's never left this town so, why would he ever change it? It's just crazy, like, some things change too much some things stay the same. (Liam) Yeah. Scott's gonna take me out tonight. - Tonight? - Yeah! We have plans tonight. Well, work plans. Like, what about the book? Oh, my gosh, Liam, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, but we're gonna get to it, I promise. It's just suddenly I have a really good feeling about Scott. Third time is a charm. You guys want some water? Well, I guess I'll have some dinner with your dad. Hi, ladies. Ah, ah. - Oh, Oh! - 'Ow! The chicken..' - Run for the hills, girls! - Liam, they're escaping. [Liam imitates clucking] - Ow! - Oh. - Hi - Hi. The chickens are escaping. Really? The chickens are escaping! Oh, you wouldn't believe how fast a French chick can run. [laughs] Oh, yeah. The important thing is you got 'em all back. Hm. [sighs] So, how come you're not spending Christmas with your girlfriend? I, um, I don't have one. Would you like some advice about strategy? I played this game before, you know? Marie and I played every night. I bet you won every game, too, right? Only if she'd let me. [laughs] What can you do? There's only ever one thing to do. - What's that? - Make a move. Probably gonna regret this. Checkmate. [laughs] Well, you...make the wrong move and you lose, right? At least you tried. - Hey, you look lovely. - Aw, thanks, dad. (Cynthia) See you later. - Hi! - Wow. Playing a little chess? I've been trying to. He's so good. So, my gentleman caller's gonna be here any minute. Here we go again, huh? You can go ahead and tell me why you think it's not Scott. I don't know, might be. So what? You spent the first few days here talking about how you and Scott didn't...have anything. It was a long time ago. Maybe he's changed, right? - I mean, we were kids. - Okay, you know what? I think you deserve a little bit more than a bunch of clichés. [doorbell rings] Liam, why are you doing this? Now I'm about to go on a date. Well, I'm sorry, it's just that I.. I care about you, and I worry about you. But you keep puttin' yourself out there and you keep gettin' hurt. Maybe it's time you need to slow down. I'm a big girl.

[instrumental music] Let me know if you need anything else. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. I got to admit something, Scott growing up, I really did not peg you for a law man. Oh, well, we don't have much of a criminal element but we do get the occasional bar fight fender benders here and there, but most of all people just call me when they need help. Get paid to be neighborly. Oh, it really sounds like you found your place. Yeah. What can I say? Best times of my life have been here. I can't believe you remember I love cupcakes. I've known you for a long time. Come on. I didn't know you knew me that well. The cupcakes, the singers, the gifts I'm, I'm just, I'm really blown away. - Gifts? - Yeah. I'm all about gifts.

'I didn't think of that.' I'm so excited. 'You're full of surprises.' Heard you givin' Scott some advice back there in the barn. Yeah. Man, you're just all day dumb, aren't you?

We're not going to bingo. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Come on. - You lead the way. [instrumental music] (Cynthia) Thank you. [Cynthia gasps] Oh, my gosh. Looks like they're, they're having some sort of, like, private event or something. It's the Christmas Cotillion. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Oh, thank you so much. - Oh, thank you. Appreciate it.

I know, but I'm not a princess. I'm not a little girl, I'm not you. This is who I am. I don't care about the dresses and the parties and the presents I just want, like, a simple, quiet nice relationship with my husband. 'I don't understand why you don't get that.' I hear you. I hear you, but it's.. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. This is your day. This is your big day, and I.. You should do what you want. You're gonna look so amazing in whatever you wear. Thank you.

You know, this has just been such a special two weeks I feel like, maybe you should call off the grand finale. Like, I would love it, but Janet's a little bit on edge. I feel, like, you know, it might kind of interfere with the ceremony, you know what I mean? Yeah. ...soon we'll be filling out that joint tax return. [all laughing] Thank you all, and thank you.

How does make that okay to you? - Cindy-- - Stop calling me that. The.. "Cynthia." It's just been annoying me. It's Cynthia. Cynthia, uh.. So I didn't send the presents. I mean, we had a great time together. That counts for something, right? Is that what you think a relationship is about, Scott? Presents? Seriously? I thought that's what you wanted. I mean, everyone said that you were this romantic and.. Do you think I'm that shallow that I would actually choose that over a real connection? Oh, my God. I'm.. I feel really stupid.

But you were the one who sent me the gifts. - It was so sweet. - What? No, I-I didn't. Liam, you don't have to play along. It couldn't have been anybody else. Why, because there's nobody else left? Is that the reason that you're here? You're making it sound-- You think that I came here for two weeks with your family just to work on a book? - Yeah. - Come on, Cynthia. - I-I came here to be with you. - I didn't know. Yeah, I thought things are gonna be different this time, you know. I thought that you were finally gonna see but you know, I-I can't do this anymore. - Wait, what? - I can't. Liam, wait, Liam. - Please. Please. - Oh, please. - Look, I can't do this. - Liam, Liam. - I can't do this. - Please, don't go. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna go get a motel. And I'm gonna take a bus out of here tomorrow. - No. - Please don't. I-I don't wanna be your leftovers. I know. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I just, I can't do this. I-I guess, I'll just.. I'll see you when I see you. [sobbing] [instrumental music] I don't know about ruined. All in all, I thought it all went pretty well. Oh, I guess I'd think there was something wrong if there wasn't at least a little bit of Cynthia drama. And at the end of the day, we still don't know who's behind all these ridiculous presents. - What's this? - Oh, Janet, now, that's.. Please don't tell me you're behind all this stuff. (Roger) 'No, no, it's not that.' The Caribbean? What is this? It's nothing. It's uh.. It's just something I-I was thinking about.. ...for our honeymoon. Okay, Roger, we talked about this. It's already gonna be so hard on my dad that I'm moving out. I can't leave him here alone. I can't leave town. Janet, y-your father can manage for a week while his newlywed daughter is-is off on a romantic cruise. 'Even he wants you to go.' Cynthia infected you with all this romance stuff. I don't like it. It's messy, okay? It confuses people, they don't know what's real 'and they don't know what's not real.' Janet.. You're-you're stressed about the wedding. I'm not stressed about the wedding. I'm stressed because I'm trying to keep this family together and everyone's ruining everything. That's the problem. - What happened? - Roger's being crazy. He, like, planned this whole secret honeymoon to the Caribbean. Ugh. And that's terrible? Of course, you would think it's cool, it's like.. ...presents and romantic getaways. Ugh! You know what, Janet, a little bit of that is not such a bad thing, you know. It doesn't have to be, like this and this all the time. But, every now and again it could be really fun. You're so much like mom, it's actually insane. Aww. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. I just don't really have any of that in me, you know? Like, when I said yes to Roger I said yes because that makes sense. We're friends, we get along, and he's really good to me. That's really nice. I just really want him to be-- More like you? No, I really want him to be happy. 'And I feel like you don't really get it' cause weren't here, but, like.. [sighs] When mom passed away, it was, like, awful to see dad like, this light just went out in his life and, like, I just.. I can't imagine living like that, you know? You wanna go your whole life without that kind of connection because you're scared of losing it? Yeah, I don't know, I don't know. I just don't wanna do that to Roger. I think you really fell in love. [sniffles] Love. The one thing you can't plan out. I think you have a lot more of mom in you than you think. [sighs] How's Scott? Ugh! It's over. I realized we didn't have what mom and dad had. And we definitely don't have what you and Roger are lucky enough to have. Well, what now? I don't know. I think I'm gonna stop chasing the romance. Maybe be a little bit more like my sister. - Really? - Yeah. Can you please repeat that? 'I just wanna make sure I heard it.' What would I do without you? - I love you. - I love you too.

Life's too precious not to live every moment. I hope these gifts have brought up the best in you. Your humor, your strength, your compassion. Let them remind you that even though we're apart my love will always be with you. "Take care of our girls for me and Merry Christmas. Ever yours, Marie." Dad, I'm so sorry. I feel so stupid. Oh, don't be silly, sunshine. It's alright. How did I get it so wrong? She must have planned all this when she stopped treatment. Which means she was going through all that and planning all this at the same time. She was so amazing. Oh. That's your mother for you. Oh, I can't believe I got it so wrong.
