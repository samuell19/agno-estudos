Huh? - Okay. Come on tiger, let's go. Those fish await. Where's your shoes? That's it, pull. Pull. Can you feel it? - It's heavy! - Yeah. Do you want me to help you? - I can do it! - You can do it? Okay. Oh man, it's so exciting! Look, it's coming, it's coming! Wow, that's a funny looking fish! - It's a piece of junk. - It's a clock fish. Wonder who that belonged to. Still going. What do you mean? Is it still going? - Yeah, it is! - Out there underneath that water is the town where all the old men sit in rocking chairs, and there's houses and shops, but you know what? There was a night when I was out here and it was really dark and stormy and I heard this noise. Boing, boing, boing, and it was a bell coming from under the water, 'cause the old church is still down there, and sometimes when the water is really low, you can see the tip of the spire. - I think I can see it now. Can you see it now? Uh-huh. Can you hear the bell? - I can, a little bit. When can I come fishing with you for real? - When you learn to swim. I told you that before. See that mountain over there? - Yeah? - I'm gonna take you to a river that's on the other side of that mountain, and we'll fish there. Well this morning, we have a style, And Maria has noticed that a number of magpies, - Jude. - Huh? - Jude, she's not in the bedroom. Caylin-Calamdria? - What are you doing with this? What are you up to now, Caylin-Calamdria? How long have you been out here? - Caylin-Calamdria! Caylin! - Mum! Mum, mum, mum! I caught an Atlantic Salmon! Dad says I can gut it myself! - No, no, no way. Just go jump in the shower. I'll make you some toast. - Please? - Go on, do as your told. What's wrong? - I don't wanna deal with fried food this morning. - I didn't have the heart to tell him to throw it back in again. Seemed to be so proud of it. You know the way it is. - Hi. - Hi! Hi, Tom. - Hi! - In you go. Seatbelt, please. Bye mom! - See you later! - Can I see yours? - Excited about the weekend? Yeah. - Yeah, it'll be great. - Yeah, great. Looking forward to it. - Sorry to barge in so early. - No worries. Shouldn't be eating this crap. Those crunchy fish might feed on them. All right, let's see if you are pregnant before we start panicking. - I must be. I never get sick. - Claire, stop imagining the worst! Stewie was telling me it's the big fish-athon this weekend. Now Peggy's been nagging me to take her fishing with me. Now, last weekend, took her up to Fire Lake for the evening rise. - What if it happens again? - But it won't. Besides, this time we're prepared. - I'm so looking forward to some time out. I hear one more word about fishing. - There's only three more deliveries, but they're all out on the plain. Why don't you invite me over for a home cooked meal while Stewie's away? - Let me consider your generous offer and get back to you. No. - That's way too close to the ground back here. You're gonna bash it on the ground. And you're breaking your wrist open. Yep, just keep it hard up against the wrist there. - Hey, Rocco. - Morning. - Hey, Billy. - Morning. - Very flash. Thought you were broke? I am. - Beautiful. Fast action. Very. - Can't wait to get to that river. - Some of us have work to do. Oh, don't worry about that, Miss. I'll do it. - Thank you. - How are you doing? - Good, thank you. ♪ It's time to say goodbye to Jindabyne ♪ ♪ It's been my home these 50 years of time ♪ ♪ Now the mountains in their winter snow ♪ ♪ And the snowy river down below ♪ ♪ Is whispering farewell to Jindabyne ♪ In the southeastern corner of New South Wales, the old town of Jindabyne was a historic landmark. With the inception of the Snowy scheme, the town was moved to a position on higher land to make way for the rising waters backed up by the dam constructed in the valley. One of the older residents of the township is Mr Tom Weston. - I was born again at Jindabyne, you know, but I come to Faraday for a while, and then me father shipped it to Leeswood. I see. Mrs Rankin, how do you feel about leaving the old town? - Oh well, there's sentimental reasons, of course. Why, you feel a bit sad, but when you get better conditions you think you'll feel better about it. Finally, on the 19th of December, 1964-- - Lunch. - Go on, I won't tell Claire. - I fished it out this morning from the drowned town. - I've been there. - I've been there too. - Not all the way. - My dad says there's old men down there. - I know. Zombies. When you drown, they get you, and you have to be their slave. I touched one once. It leaked on my foot. It's tongue was green slime. Poison. But, I kicked him in the head and got away. Come on! Don't be a baby, and don't forget the knife. He won't swallow it! - You're hurting him! - We can't offer him up if he's awake! - If you want my opinion, it smells like air freshener. - You're truly a horrible man. - Heard from Carmel, there's been an incident at the school. - Tom could be expelled for bringing a knife. - I made him. - What on earth were you gonna do with that? - It's private. - Private? I'll give you private! You're seven years old! - Kids, this is very serious. - You know what? Tom's expelled, I'm sending you to the orphanage. - Excellent. - None of the other kids saw them. I'll be able to contain this. - Contain what? We're talking about a dead rodent. - We're talking about the class pet. They were supposed to be taking care of him. Look, Jude, we're talking about a knife and we're talking about drugs. - I can't believe Tom brought a weapon to school. Carmel, I am so sorry. - Claire, this is not a weapon. It's a fishing knife. And anyway, we all know it's not Tom's doing. - Have you considered grief counselling for Caylin-Calamdria? It might help you and Carl as well. You know, you can go as a family. - I do not need to get some advice from some stranger. - We'll buy a new guinea pig tomorrow. - We can't tomorrow, we're going to visit Nana! - No you're not, you're grounded. - Can I be grounded at Tom's house? - No. - Yes, that's fine. - Claire, I wouldn't do it to you. Not for the whole weekend. We'll ground them in shifts. Go on, go and get your stuff. She's getting worse. - Give her time. - Time? Show me where you buy some of that. Your granddaughter's just done her first murder. - Toilet's plugged again. - Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa! Guess what, guess what? We're grounded! - Grounded! - What? What does that mean? - You're early. - Claire, I don't approve of women and children being housebound this weekend. - Well, I'm sorry about that, but Tom has to take responsibility for his choices. - Surely he's got another 50 years to learn that. Where are the Daysun glasses? - Packed away. - What's the point of that? Things are meant to be used! I found that down at the back of the cupboard. Well, you don't have to like it. You just have to live with it. I did. You still smell of petrol. - Nice hair. - Oh, thanks. - Guess what? Chevonne's left her husband. A repeat performance, no word, no note. No point, according to her. So you see, it wasn't just you! - I'm not interested in that. - Don't be silly. We all love hearing gossip about people we hate. - I don't know why you even keep in touch with her. - I invested time and energy in that marriage as well as you, and she's always been good to me. - Tom took a knife to school. - Well, at least he knows how to handle it. Claire, you're overreacting. - This isn't open for discussion! - Of course it is! - You guys sort it out. - It is sorted. Sorted. - That hair makes you look like the kind of man who raises prostitutes. - Do you think she'll come tonight? - She mostly comes when I'm by myself. - Elissa, he's going away a boy, but he's gonna come back a man. - No thanks, I want him back just the way he is. - Well don't let him loose with this bunch of maniacs. Hey come on, you'll wake the baby! Jeez. - Carl, Carl, take it easy. - Don't you worry about me. - I need you fit for tomorrow. - What's this, what's this-- - What? What's what? There's something different about you. I think he looks very dashing. - I can't wait, I wish we could go tonight. - The word is dashing. Elissa, Elissa, Billy told me that you've served at almost everywhere in the world. Is that true? Pretty much. Best place in the world right here, right? - I'm sure I don't like being this far inland. There's no water. - We've got more water than bloody Sydney harbour! There's no waves, though. You can't surf without a wave. - In a happy valley-- Here we go, here we go. - Lays a hidden river. - Full of baloney. - There dwells a fish, Mm. - Wild and cunning. A mysterious, wild, Elusive! - Stay with it, baby. Stay with it! Keep going! - A serious, wild fish. - Fucking hurry up, will you? My arm's falling off. Immemorial. - Ancient, immemorial. - Don't expect many caught of them. - As time lays waiting-- - As we are all doing. - Waiting for us. I knew this speech last year! Anyway, to the wild one! To the wild one! Cheers. - The wild one! Here we go! - Mm. - Thank Ross he can fish better than you can talk. - What's she done now? - Nothing. She's an angel. They both are. We had a pow wow and we decided we deserve a treat too. Oh, don't panic. We're not gate crashing. - No, no you're not, mom. Please, sit down, sit down, sit down. - Well, if you're sure we're not in the way. No, not at all. - We can build a little creche down into the table for ya. You can sit on the end. - I'll sit here. We grannies must stick together. - I hear you put the fright on a guinea pig today. - All right. Let's go. Claire, sit down. - The children are grounded. - Yeah, I know, but it's the one night and we're, please, sit down. - Don't spoil it, Claire. - Sorry. - All right gentlemen, come on. On your feet. It's that time of year again. - Get down. There's the beautiful ones. Come on, snuggle up. - You're bloody big for a hooker, aren't ya? - All right, look like you're having a good time. Carl, you look the best. Eh? Again, come on, one more! Beautiful! - Oh, that's all right, don't worry. - Come on! - One more! - Oh, all right, one more. Got it? What time do you call this? I call this morning. Relax, we're on bloody holiday. - No, no, I'm still here. Me too. - For fuck's sake! - It's okay man, I'll do it. I'll do it. Gotta go. Right, bye, bye. - Hey, Billy, put the sign around the right way, you dope! Now listen, try to avoid the potholes, will ya? Brain's ringing in the fridge. - What brain? - Ha ha. I'm never drinking again. - Ha! - Hi, Elissa. - Hello? Oh, really? Okay. Bye. She loves me. - Love-struck. - Hen pecked. - Been lying. Too bloody right. - Are you sick? - No, I just ate too much last night. - No, you didn't. When my mom was sick, she spewed up green slime. It was gross. - It wasn't her fault. She couldn't help it. It was bile. Everyone has that in their tummy. It's not, it's not gross, it's natural. - Are you gonna die? - No, my love. No one's gonna die. You're stuck with me. - Before I go, there's something I'd like to say. - No, there's something I'd like to say to you. You have no authority over my family. Not anymore. It's time you accepted that. - You sound very wound up. You need to be careful. - I'm fine. - They're my boys too, Claire. I didn't come to this godforsaken country to make a nuisance of myself. I came here because they needed me. - I know that, and I'm grateful. We all are. But that's in the past now. - It's not me that's ridden by the past. I know you're accustomed to doing without a mother, but I'd just like to say, you're like a daughter to me now. Must you always fight it? - Oh man. I'm not getting any reception. - You won't get any reception up here, mate. - I'm not getting anything. - Watch out for snakes, Billy. - Serious? - God. Listen to that. - Sorry? - Bloody typical. Judes forgot to pack my sandwiches. - Want some of this? It's protein! It's good for you. - Mm. - Three beautiful women walk into bar. It's always three beautiful women with you. - No, just listen, listen. A blonde, brunette, and a lesbian, see? And the barmaid sees them-- - What colour hair has the lesbian got? - How the fuck do I know? Blue. Anyway, barmaid comes over-- - Elissa used to be a lesbian. Well, she's not anymore. - Anyway, lesbian says... - You're out of condition, old man. - No I'm not. Someone just moved the river, that's all. - I have to show this place to Elissa. - No, no, no, no, no. No women allowed. Oh Jesus. Fuck! Oh Jesus! Jesus fuck. Jesus Christ. Jesus, Jesus! Carl! Carl! Come here! Oh fuck! Oh Jesus! Carl! Rocco, for fuck's sake, come here! Where the fuck are you? Fuck. Fuck! Take her. Take her! Take her, for fuck's sake, take her! - Oh fuck! Fuck this! - Where are you going? Billy, no, no, no! Billy, no! - I propose that we leave her here. If she gets carried downstream, she'll go down to the rapids and we'll never find her. - Yeah. No, I agree with that. We should tie her up in the water. It's freezing. If you put her out in the sun, she'd be history. - I don't think we should ever have touched her. I mean, it's a crime scene and we disturbed it. - Billy, for fuck's sake, shut up. - My plants! I have to save my plants! Hm! Igor, could you turn off that annoying siren? - Zombie. If you insist, Master Scramble, but we are heading into a black hole. - So what the hell am I gonna do with her? I'm losing her too. - No you're not. - I am. I can feel it. - Hi! I invited Carmel. - Why? - She's Rocco's girlfriend. We should make her feel comfortable. Jude! - Okay, okay. - Hi Miss Jane! - Have you done your homework? Joking. - Oh, look! Look! Hm? Oh wow! - Did you see the cake? - Three DVDs, the express issue of Vanity Fair, and all I've done is sleep. - One for your luck? - Mind if I open a window? - Of course not. It's a shame we have to babysit. I was all geared up for a good dance. - Pub is packed and jumping. Can I have a glass, please? - Yep. God I love dancing. The Bee Gees. What? - The Bee Gees? - Yeah? - You can't be that old! - Hello! - Is that homemade? Whoa, homemade! Can I try? - Yeah, I'll make sure you get the biggest piece. Now leave it! Go on, scoot. - But, but-- - You'll get one later! I promise. - She's a handful. - She's her own person, just like her mother was. Never wanted any of your own? - Haven't found the perfect man yet. - You're kidding? Women in this town would queue up for Rocco. - So I gather. Actually, I'm starting to wonder if I can even have kids. But hey, maybe Rocco has the mighty seed. - Rocco was gonna be my son-in-law. - Really? - Mm. Once upon a time. - So what about you, Claire? You obviously love children. - Stewart wouldn't want anymore. - Well, who could blame him? - Have I said something that I shouldn't have? - Of course not. I wasn't well after Tom was born. I couldn't look after him, so it was hard on Stewart. - Must have been hard for you too. - Claire took off. - I went to stay with my sister. - For 18 months! - You know what? So yeah, it was hard on Stewart. - I've stopped expecting anybody to understand. - You two should count your blessings! You're young, you're healthy, you're family's still in one piece. People dying in the wrong order, that's pretty much when it all turns to shit. Come on, we're off. But the movie! - Come on, mum, let's get you back to the Veggie Patch. Come on. Come on, come on. - Jude, Jude, put her down. Put her down, come on. You're not going anywhere. - Are you all right? - I'm sorry. I'm just so tired. What's wrong with the fucking Bee Gees anyway? - Nothing. Nothing. - There's nothing wrong with the Bee Gees. Piss off! - We love the Bee Gees! The greatest musical artists ever! We love them. - Okay, look. See that rise over there? Okay, you're gonna reel him in. Now set it up. Fantastic! Okay, now take your time. Play him in. That's it. Okay, now! Let him fight, let him fight, let him fight! Come on, you've got him, you've got him! You got him. That's it. Yes! Could have scooped him up with one hand. Sure you could. - Which one's dinner? - Not mine. Mine's coming home with me. - All right. Hold him, I'll get a photograph. - Oh, hang on. - Trap this stunned moment. - Okay, hold it up. Can't wait to get back to that river. - Mm. - I can, I'm rooted. - I feel really trippy. - Too much sun. - I've never known anything like it. - Something's got the river spirits in a good mood. - Look, I don't care what you guys do, but I'm gonna leave tomorrow morning. Hey, how are you? I'm okay. We found a body. I caught the most amazing fish, though! What? - Yeah, no problem. Yeah, bye. Fuck. Cops are wanting us to stay here. - What'd they say? - Nothing. What would they say? - Well, a lesbian told Billy not to bother bringing his fish home. - We gotta get this story straight. - Let's just go under together, okay? All right? You ready? Hang on. I'm gonna be right here. I'm not going anywhere. We'll go under on three, all right? One, hold your breath, two, three, here we go! Good boy! Oh, that was so good, though! You don't wanna do it again, do you? No? Okay. But, good boy! I'm gonna swim out, I'll be right back. You stay right there. Tom? Are you all right? What did that man say? - Which way to the motel? - You catch anything? You smell like fish. - You're so soft. So warm. - Dad! Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad! - Huh? - Dad! - What? What, what, what? - Police! - What, what? - Police! - Who is it? - Police. - What's going on? - Good morning Claire. I just need a word with Stewart. - Stewart! Yeah? Yeah, I'm coming. - We just need you to answer a few more questions, Stewart. Yeah, okay. - What's going on? - Look, could you come down-- Yeah, I said okay! I said I'll come, right? - Okay, okay. - Hello? No, I don't have any bloody comment. - What is going on? - We, we found a body. Where? - In the river. Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll be all right. You look after mum, you hear me? Be back in a minute. - We don't step over bodies in order to enjoy our leisure activities! You pack of bloody idiots. I'm ashamed of you! The whole town's ashamed of you. Here's Claire. - Hi. I don't understand. When did they find her? - What did Stewart tell you? - Not much. There really wasn't time. - Bastard. Billy and I were up all night talking about it. - So, you gonna charge us with something or not, Jimbo? - Get out. Go on, piss off! Here they come! Here they come. Come on. - We never destroyed any evidence. - Billy! - Get out of it, you bastard! - You found her on Friday? It's Monday! - Please, Claire. - Give you some bloody meat in your sandwich! - Carl twisted his ankle! - Honestly, Carl could hardly walk. - I couldn't leave the guys without a car. It wouldn't be responsible. I mean, we'll discuss this later. I'll see you. Bye. - They're saying she's a blackfella. - I told you that. - No you didn't. - Of course I did! - No. - I'm sure I told you. - You can't have said it very loud if you said it all. I'll get the facts for myself. - What's going on, Rocco? - I'm sure I told her. - What happened out there? - What did Stewart tell you? Carl bunged up his ankle. He's not up to it anymore, you know that. Look, I've got a really busy day. - Don't worry. I'll make sure Carmel is all right. Could you have left her there, Terry, and gone fishing? - I hate fishing. - You think we did the wrong thing by that girl? - No, she didn't care what we did. She's got no opinion, no feelings one way or the other. She's dead. - Hey. It's good to be home. - Tom's still up. He needs to ask you some questions. - Was it scary? - No. It was sad. - What did the dead lady look like? - She looked like she was, asleep. - Caylin-Calamdria says she has no clothes on. - Caylin-Calamdria doesn't know as much as she thinks she knows. - Was the dead lady under the water where it's deep? - Your dad took her out of the water and he wrapped her up in a sleeping bag and he made her all nice and warm and cosy. - Caylin-Calamdria says that she, there's a serial killer. She says he's coming after you. - Now listen. You don't pay attention to anything anybody says, no matter what they say. That river is a very long, long way away, and there are no bad men here, okay? Now go to sleep. I didn't want to upset you. I thought it could wait til this morning. - What really happened out there? - I told you. Nothing happened, we just, we got stuck, that's all. Jeez, I don't know what the fuss is about. I really don't! - What if it had been Tom in the water? - Well, it wasn't Tom! It was a stranger! I wish you wouldn't keep dwelling on this. You're gonna make yourself sick again. - I didn't make myself sick. - I didn't mean that-- - People don't make themselves sick! It's something that happens to you. Something bad that happens to you! - I just want you to be okay. That's all! Jesus, I'm sorry I mentioned it. - Last night, how could you have touched me like that? After finding her? - Claire, I am so, exhausted. - She needed your help. - She didn't need my help! She was beyond help! There was, there was nothing anybody could do for her. - Sorry I'm late. - Sorry you're late. Where did they get this information from? Jesus. - Yeah, Jesus. Do not give these people any more information! We have to stick together on this. - I wonder who she belongs to. Was she raped? - There was some bruising. Then again, maybe she was up for it. - Why would you even think that? - You see this cut around her ankle, down to the bone? Stewart did that when he tethered her to a tree. Too lazy to walk back up to the road. Then again, maybe they just got off on the whole thing. - I haven't seen you before. - No, I... - How can I help you? - What would I need to do if I wanted to terminate a pregnancy? - We ask Saint Bridget to protect this fine house for another year. Bless this house that holds this cross. Protect it night and day. And those who dwell within, protect us from all harm, we pray. - Amen. - Put it on that. - I'm confused. Hold on. This finger with that? - It's my best batch yet. You still throwing up? - No. - You know, our children are God's way of telling us how much he loves us. - Police have tonight released the identity of an Nunga girl found murdered in the Kosciuszko National Park. SPS warns indigenous viewers that this report contains the name of a deceased person. The body of 19 year old Susan O'Connor was found late Friday in a remote area of the park by a group of local fisherman, but it was not reported to police until the following Sunday. - She went to the country music festival. Now we don't think she ever got there. They're animals. I don't know how any civilised human being could do what they did, and I really wonder how differently they would have acted if she were white! - Here we go. - I went and saw her today. - What? - In the hospital, in the mortuary. - What the hell for? - You tethered her to a tree. - I, I did it for her own safety. Besides, you weren't even there! - The sooner they find the person responsible, the better. Then all this blame can go where it belongs! - Give me that. Tom has to go now. I hate this vase, Vanessa. - For fuck's sakes. You don't have to do that. Leave it, leave it, leave it. Leave it, leave it. - Come on, boy. Come on. Just like old times. - Yeah, just like the old times, yeah. - No respect, you dog! Bullshit, I want something done about it. - Well, I'm not filling a complaint. - Why the hell not? - 'Cause he started it. - Started what? Did I murder anybody? Did I destroy anybody's property? - No, you just managed to make a tragic situation far worse. - Oh, I didn't realise it was your job to enforce the political correctness laws, Jimbo? - I would have thought out of all the people in this town, you'd be the one who could understand what her family's going through right now. - We do understand. That does not make us responsible. - Carmel? What's wrong? - You went to the hospital. - I needed to see her for myself. - I can't believe you'd behave so disrespectfully to her and to her family. Would you walk into a stranger's house while they were asleep and have a good old perv at them? - Of course not! - Spirit has gone anywhere. Dead doesn't mean dead. - I understand that. - Do you? - I need to know what happened out there. - Shit happened, like it always does! - Well, then I have to face it and not look away. - Claire, this isn't about you! - It's about all of us! Isn't it, Carmel? I mean, who are we? - Stewart. - Hi, Terry. Busy morning? - Yeah, busy enough. Hi. - You have to sort this out, Claire. We have to move on. Look, I was worried that, the girl would be dragged down to the rapids. Carl's ankle was fucked. He couldn't walk. There was no way we could hike back. The kid was freaking out. It was just, there was nothing we could do. I don't see why I have to justify myself to you. Claire? - What if you'd found a boy in the river? Wouldn't you have taken him out and covered him up? - What? What are you talking about? - You don't know? - No, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know where you're going with this. You're not making any sense. - Of course not. That's because I'm the unstable one. - Well, let's face it, Claire, you're not exactly behaving rational-- Oh, for fuck's sakes! - Aren't I? - Bitch! - What? What? What? - Leave it! - What do you got to say? - Go back to the car. Claire, go back to the car! - What? - It's okay. Back to the car. Please, go back to the car. - Let me go. Come on. - Oh yeah. Sorry. The bogeyman is home. - Hello. - Hi! - Tom and I are collecting money to pay for Susan O'Connor's funeral. We all know how important it is to be a real community at a time like this. Tom? - Please help. - They're our neighbours! - These people look after their own, and quite frankly, Claire, I think that's what you should be doing. - Stop! Sorry. - That was close. - Listen to me. When a bad thing happens, we all have to do a good thing, no matter how small, all right? Otherwise the bad things, they pile up and they-- - Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on. - Is Carmel still angry? - You have to make sure she comes on Saturday. - Maybe we should cancel-- - No, no, it's what we all need! Just promise me. Promise me you'll both come. That's cheap. - You almost got it! - So just keep, keep your arm straight. Don't bend your elbow. Go on. - Ooh! - Ow! You did that on purpose! - Give us a look. - Get off me and die! Elissa! What happened? - He couldn't find her. It was by accident. - Given up drinking altogether, have we, Miss Moppet? Oh, Carmel's here. - Oh, thank God. We can finally all sit down and talk. - Claire, leave it alone. Let it heal over. - We need to get this all sorted! - Don't tell me what I need. I need life to get back to bloody normal, whatever that is, and I don't need you begging all over town on my behalf. Carmel. And I don't need you dragging my granddaughter miles out of her way to rub her nose in more bloody misery. - Hi. - Well, they actually think it might be the same guy, from last time, from '79, but they didn't have any DNA back then, so they-- Oh, can we change the frigging subject just for once? - Why? - Apparently there are sacred places in these mountains. - That's right, secret men's business. - You men shouldn't even be going fishing up there. - Give me a fucking break. - Our taxes are still paying parks and wildlife, last I heard. - Yeah, well, I was told that the spirits of the dead cross those mountains. They travel from all over up to the high country. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, I think we broke her journey by tying her up. - Bullshit. You know, I thought Catholics were superstitious, your lot take the biscuit, really. I mean, think about it, it's just that superstition, you know, journey spirits, ow! - Shit. - Oh Jesus! Come on, let's get him inside. Oh, you fucking prick! Come on. - Carmel! - What was all that, huh? Huh? I can take care of myself. Here you go, put some water on it. Let me have a look, let me have a look. Oh yeah. He needs to go to casualty. I don't wanna go to casualty, I don't wanna go to the hospital! - It's okay, I'll take him. - No way, you're way over the limit! Your nose is all-- - Just get me a mirror. - Claire, Stewart needs to go to the hospital. Here. Here, look. - Dad! - See? You always do it when the adrenaline is still pumping. That way, you don't feel a thing. - Oh, God. - I'm okay. - Don't worry sweetheart, it'll all be over. - Bull crap. I don't want to. - You have to. - Dad, do I have to go to the dead lady's house? - Her name is Susan. You should get that X-rayed. - I'm late. - I wanna go with my dad. - This isn't open for discussion. - He can come with me if he wants. Here, go on inside and wait for me. I've had enough. - You are piss-weak. I'm sorry. I don't want to intrude, I just wanted to give you this. - What's this for? - For the funeral. The whole town wanted to help. It's not charity. - Are you buying something, then? - What's going on here? This was supposed to be finished yesterday! - Yeah, it'll be done in an hour. It's a piece of shit anyway. - Just get on with it, would you? - Not now, Tom, I'm flat out. Hey. No, I haven't had a chance to talk to him yet. Just hang on a second. Tom, this is a private conversation. Yeah, no, I will, I will. It's just, it's not the right time. - For some people, going to church is a bit like going to the dentist. They'll put up with a lot of toothache before they'll give in. - If you could just pass this check along to her parents. - The O'Connor family is not of my congregation. They wouldn't welcome my interference. - I don't understand why this is so hard. - Hm? - I just want to stay connected to people. I just want the man I love to be a good man. - What's the verdict? - Whole thing needs rewired. - Shit. Well, give it here, I'll see what I can do. - Thank you. - They're having a special ceremony for her after the funeral, by the river where the music festival was held. - I wouldn't be welcome. - It's tomorrow afternoon. - Your dad could get his spitoony sprained if he doesn't go to hospital. - I wanna hit Rocco. - They're all zombies now. - That's such crap, man! - Let's go to the underwater city. Come on! Tom, come in! It's lovely. Come on! Jump! Tom! - I know you're just pretending! - Tom! - Caylin-Calamdria! Caylin-Calamdria! Caylin-Calamdria! Caylin-Calamdria! - Tom? - He did it! - Tom! What the hell are you two playing at? Get here! What are you doing? Get in the car now! Get in the car! Are you all right? Get in the car. I can't believe you, Caylin-Calamdria! Where'd you think he was? Stewart? I've got better things to do than look after your son! - I didn't ask you to take care of my son, Jude. - Jude, that's enough. It's not Caylin-Calamdria's fault that she's alive and our girl's dead. - Hi. - Hey. - There's a special service being held for Susan tomorrow. I think we should go, all of us, together. - Go home, Claire. Tom nearly drowned today. - What? - Go home. - Oh, Stewart agreed I should move back in for a while, just til things settle down. - Guess what, mum? I swam. - That's wonderful. - Live from Darwin via National Nine News reporter, Bethany Jensen. Bethany, where exactly is the-- - He should have been with me. - Hm? Maybe he should have learned to swim when he was a baby, like every other kid. Of course, you weren't there then and you weren't there today. - Oh no. No. I'm not the one who's done anything wrong. I'm not the one who's lying. - About what? - Just tell me. - Tell you what? - How it felt? Fishing with her tied up, just, tell me, how did it make you feel? - Oh Jesus, can we please leave this alone? - Can't you just tell me? - It felt good! Is that what you want me to say? It was a beautiful day. The river was beautiful. I felt so fucking alive! Jesus. If that's a crime, I don't know it. - I hate the way you do that. I hate the way you end a conversation just because you had enough. - Why? Do you know something? Because I have had enough! - I hate the way you guzzle your beer, you watch TV, you fuck like a robot! - I work like a fucking dog! That's my life! The beer and the fuck are supposed to be a bonus! - But what kind of man needs that to feel alive? - What kind of man? What kind of man needs that? What kind of woman runs away from our child, eh? Eh? - No, no, no! - What about fucking that? - You stop it! - Stewart! Stewart, stop it! You fuck! - Stop doing that! Running away from your child, you've been gone for fucking ever! - Listen to me! Listen to me! Stop it, stop it, stop it! - No! No! No! No! Fucking no! - You were right. - Hey. - Hey. Where were you? It was mental here today. - I'm sorry, man. Elissa's really homesick, so, we're all heading up the coast. She's gonna teach me how to surf! - Great. - Look, man, I know it sucks, me pissing off like this. - Well, what can you do? People come, people go. What do I owe you? - Oh, don't worry about it man, it's fine. - No, no, no, no. I insist. - Well, maybe just the three days. - There you go. - Thanks, man. I really appreciate this. - Take care. - Thank you. - Hey, you shake his hand! Billy! It doesn't matter, Elissa. - Does he wanna get back? - Claire, talk to Stewie. - I've tried. - But you haven't told him the truth, have you? - I'm heading over the mountain to go to Susan's memorial. I want you to come with me. - I can't. Kid's fucked off. Left me high and dry. - Then close for the day. - I can't just shut up shop for no reason. - Pretend you're going fishing. I don't know when I'll be back. I have something I have to sort out. - You just can all fuck off as far as I'm concerned, but I'll tell you one thing. Whatever happens, nobody is taking my boy. Things that you discovered over those years working in the Kosciuszko National Park. The most interesting aspect of it is the wide. You obviously then. - Stewart? - Terry. - Hair colour turn out all right, then? - Yeah. Hey guys. - Did I break it? - Yeah, yeah. - Haven't lost my touch, then. - No. You haven't lost your touch, no. - Carl reckons Billy's gone. Yeah. Gone off to be a surfer. - Lesbian's not finished with the poor boy yet. - Half his luck. - What happened out there? - I don't know. Claire has left me again. - No way. I reckon you've got it wrong. - See this woman here? She's married to one of the bastards who found Susan! - I'm just here to pay my respects. - Respects? What respect? You better piss off. Get out of here! - Leave her alone. - Piss off! - Leave her alone, boy. - You don't belong here, yeah? Leave her alone. - Mom! - My name is Stewart Cane. I was one of the men who found your daughter. I'm really sorry. I came, I came to apologise. - Come on, we'll go and walk through the smokes so the spirits don't latch on to us. - This was the last song that Susie ever wrote before she left us to come here to this place.
