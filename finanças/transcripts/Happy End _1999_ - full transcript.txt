You're gentle What am I, a volunteer? Gentle?! Because they learn directly from a native speaker, the children aren't afraid of foreigners, Plus they have fun... Wouldn't you say? If you say "circle," the children don't really understand But if you cut out a circle with a pair of scissors, then, to them it's a circle itself It becomes a circle "Donggurami" is a "circle," "Kawi" are "scissors," and "Jareugi" is "cutting" They learn English this way without using Korean They just learn the words as "circle" and "scissors" Well, let us think about it a little more, and then we'll make a decision Alright. And this is the web designer for our institute I forgot to mention this... - Hello - Hello I missed one thing We send children's progress reports by e-mail every week You use the Internet, don't you?

But I can't pull myself together What should I do? Don't do this to me...! I just don't understand you Didn't you make up your mind when you took off your wedding ring? This might be our last chance Get a grip on yourself! Look, I'm a wife and a mother! I know, but you told me in the hospital when Yun was born... That our daughter is beautiful Our daughter! You're crazy! Really crazy! Since when did she have a fever? A few hours maybe... Doctor, I'm afraid I don't know... - Did she consume anything strange? - I'm afraid ants got into her milk Ants? Take her blood test and make sure she gets plenty of fluid Yes, doctor - Il-Beom, shall we die together? - Why not...

He forced off the ring and broke her finger - Are you alright? - Yes... Sorry. It's par of my job to ask you questions after something like this Where were you on the day of the incident from 2AM to 5AM? Sorry, but I need to ask you a favor I can't get in touch with Bora since last night Yun's still at the playhouse, and I called them...
