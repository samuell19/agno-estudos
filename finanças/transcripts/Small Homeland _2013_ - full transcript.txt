You're shaving next time, ok? Stop. Do you remember? You'd put it here...like this... Push. Whatever, you're not getting a stiffy. Come. The money... SMALL HOMELAND Anes! You jerk! Still here, are you? What can I do? What are you doing, twat? At least I'm not cleaning cowsheds, like you! So, I'm an idiot, right? Yes, an idiot! Albania is full of cowsheds to clean! I'll find you a job. You know I don't like these jobs... Any other job you like? No, I've got a job! You should smoke more, Bilal. At least don't do it here: I work here. Bloody hell! What a mess. There's flies, too. - What are you doing? - I'm killing the flies! I'm killing the flies! Let's go. Look at the mess you've made! Go get a broom to clean it up. Give me a cloth. Look at the mess! Look here. Hey, you fool! What is it? Leave it there, it's not ours. Leave it! Let's record something. Just one thing! But what do you want to record? Are you crazy? ...here we have a young lady who was clearing up the room, she's taking away ...all the necessities for lunch. What do you like eating? Who's this talking? Is it a man? Let it be, that's enough! - Are you going to war, today? - Are you going to war today? Listen, he's saying it, too. Renata is going to war today What shoes do you have, sweetie? Fuck off. What the fuck do you want? - Keep still! - What the fuck do you want? A vendetta after a fight over a trivial matter, fuelled by alcohol, between four Tunisians and three East European citizens. The murder was committed around 5 am, in Piazzale Azzurri d'Italia... What's Luisa like? She's gorgeous. Drop dead gorgeous. She's always half naked, though... Put something on, Luisa. There'll be the neighbours watching you... Yes, nice and pretty. Do you want to say hello to Granny? Luisa, want to say hello? Hello, Granny! Heard that? The cry of the wild. Full of energy, all natural. So, you called for no particular reason? Nothing bad has happened, has it? Yeah... It's just that here the stink is enough to cut your breath... I kind of miss the sea. Franco... Well, well... Oh, daddy... His name isn't Frank anymore, he doesn't like it. And what is it? He said that...wait. I'll propose it. Yes, he said he doesn't like Frank. He said he likes Feng. His name is Feng. Feng Chi. Hi Feng Chi. Did you eat? Don't you want to stroke him? Stroke it? Since you've said it's Chinese, I don't want to touch it anymore. Take it away, throw it away! - Listen, I'm going to chuck him at you. - Don't! He's offended, now he'll crap on your bed. There you are, right. No, don't, Don't, I'll have to clean afterwards. It's me. Sister, I'm in the bathroom. I guess prices go up during the night... That bitch at the cheese counter... She thought she could short-change me, I'm going to show her! I'm not like my brother, always with his head in the clouds... Thief, and Southern scum! "Ma'am, we had problems with the till". You bet, next time I'll set the finance police on her. Thief! Next time she brings her laundry to wash, if you're nice to her, you can get your money from the town hall, not from me. I'm telling you! The smallest is really bad. Look how they fight. Be careful. Look. Krimb e karkalec. What's this, a caterpillar? Krimb is the smallest. You like money, don't you? Tell me something about your father. My father? And if you talked to him about us? My father hates every one of you. What do you expect me to say? He's always there, swearing away. Always... parading around...in that tank top. Just like an Albanian, wearing a tank top. You go tell him, tell him he's an Albanian and see how he answers. A drunk Albanian, that's what he can say... with the undershirt. Yes. He doesn't look like an Albanian. Those ones are Christians. Those ones, on the right. These Christians go to Church every Sunday. Just think, they have 3 hour services. They sing, dance, leap. They get up to all sorts of things. Arabs don't, instead, they pray on Fridays. Albanians don't even do that. To make up for it, they steal your car. Damn animals! Don't give up your dreams. Don't renounce your land. This is the land our ancestors bequeathed us. This is the land we, the venetians, don't want to give up. Especially not today, indeed. Today we are facing a great opportunity. Because in this moment of crisis, all excuses not to make a choice of great responsibility that falls upon us have disappeared. The only choice, called Venetian Independence. Every day, when we get up, when we read the papers having breakfast, we read terrifying news on jobs, on employment, on the state of the economy. On every matter, on politicians' morals. And somehow, we are getting used to a cloud of negativity we are rebelling against! And this evening, I'm asking you to conduct a small experiment: for five or ten seconds, let's close our eyes, let's try to free our minds from these concepts. 1, 2, 3... 4, 5, 6... 7, 8, 9, 10. Long live Venetian Independence. And this, I am convinced, will become an epoch-making event, which, every year, we will keep... The flag: Saint Mark! The flag: Saint Mark! Did you talk about a revolution? Let's be brave and not hide behind stickers, and call a spade a spade. Bloody hell! This has to be said! - If you want to change... - Me? The one on the dais. I'm not mad at you. I'm not interested. I want to hear your words, coming from your gut. Nothing personal, eh... No, I'm not annoyed because you're mad at me. It's because of what you say, and then, you don't carry it on. Because now and again you talk like this, and you do it to pull my leg, while you should be in earnest. I do talk in earnest, it's you who's not taking me seriously. You just chew the fat and then don't do anything. Easy to say "revolution, revolution"? What are you going to do it with? See the wise guy? He said "revolution". What are you going to the revolution with? I could have been Christ as a young man, instead of a martyr. The Christ of the Navel. My gastritis is striking me dead. If you were more explicit, and swallowed less bitter pills, you wouldn't suffer from stomach ache. You swallowed all they said tonight? - You let it be... - Is it ok with you? It's time to demand more of that pig. Much more. Without him noticing. What has he got? He has a sister, a churchwoman, full of fears. He's got money. He's a friend of your father's, too. He can't move. He can't do anything. Do you like money? No. You don't like money? No. Why not? Of course I like money. Luisa, where are you off to, showing your butt? Like it? Isn't it gorgeous? Go put on your shorts. But why should I? It's hot! Luisa, keep calm. I'm calm! It's just hot. You've just got your knickers on, too. - Then take them off. - Shall I? It's just like yours... perhaps a bit better. Franco, say something. "Franco, say something..." "Go put on your shorts!" When are you going to work today? What's the time? It's 8:00 am. As usual. MENON DIRTY PIG...20.000 EURO I've got to deliver this envelope to the cleaner's. I'll take you. It's for the hotel. Anyone here? Anyone here? RINO MENON DIRTY PIG PAY 20.000 EURO OR WE'LL TELL EVERYONE YOU'RE A PIG Where have you come from? Outside. Listen... Wait, I've got to talk to you. What? I don't have time, I have to go. - Where have you got to go? - Outside, they're waiting for me. Tell me. Going to act like a sleaze ball again? What do you want me to say? Something has arrived. What? What's arrived? A letter arrived. Whose? I don't know. I haven't got a clue whose letter it is. You tell me who are you having it off with? What are you up to? - What filth are you getting up to? - Give me that letter. Show me that fucking letter! Tell me, who are you having it off with? Look! Who are you having it off with? Who are you seeing? Don't be a pain in the ass! What do you want? What do you want? You are ruining me. You're a low life, shame on you! At the end, it's always me paying. - Go away! - Keep calm. Calm... - Why calm? - Calm... Why calm? I should have killed you when you were small. You think I don't know you tried? Mum had told me, you know? Lucky she was there to stop you. Because you were mum's pet, right? - I'll be your baby... - But what will we do, now? Shame on you! Mummy... You think you'll convince me by playing the nice baby, as always? It'll be ok. Mohammed Bin Laden was a devout Sunni Muslim and a brilliant business man. He won King Abdullah Aziz's trust working on the construction of the Saudi royal palaces... But what are they doing? What are they doing? What do you think they're doing? They're praying. Praying my foot! Have you taken your medicines? Renata, they're men's. - They are not men's. - They're men's. Leave it. Put them down! - I'm telling you. - Can't you see? Try them! You're hurting me. - These are for women, put them on. - You're talking? - Look at what you wear! - Because I work in these... But when I go out, I wear these. I'm not a truck driver 24/7. Look how gorgeous. Which ones are better? Those are men's? Those are ugly. Which ones does your girl wear? What's your name? You're Jessy or is it your girl? He's Jessy. Your name's Jessy? Is your name really Jessy? I'm learning Chinese on the Net. I've bought a book... You can teach me Chinese. Renata, too. We want to go to China. Right? They want you. Hello. What? Mine? But are you sure? Who's that? But where? Come! Hurry up! Leave me alone! I'll get my hands on them! I'll get my hands on them! Who was it? Dogs, dogs... Fucking dogs! Bloody shitty foreigners! The potatoes Take them. - What am I to do with the potatoes? - What am I to do with the potatoes? - Fuck! - Keep clam! Fuck! Fucking dogs! - Finished? - Finished what? Yes, finished, finished! Look at it! Fucking foreigners! Put this on. It's cold. - I didn't see anything. - I tell you he came out from down there! This isn't a place to hide cars. - Do you want to find these jerks? - Where do you think they hide them? Let's go. Where do these Albanians, these thieves as you say, hide? Stop, I'll ask. Good morning, boss. Have you seen foreigners passing by? Is anyone sleeping in there? Have you seen them bringing any cars? No one sleeps in here. But 300 years ago it was a Xenotrophium. - Xeno...what? - Ignoramuses. - What was it? - A xenotrophium! A resting place where foreign travellers, pilgrims, would stop before taking up their journey again. Thanks. What can you expect this chap to know. I'd burn them all, you bet! And 1, 2 and 3, 4, and 5, 6, 7 and again, 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6, 7 and kick back. And 1, 2, 3, And start again. And kick. And start clapping for the brilliant tryout. Who'll give me a ciggie? Hello? Is it the old codger? As long as we're alive, we're all the same age. Fuck, that's scary! You know what? Next time we let him join in too. Right? Let's see if he gets a woody at least once. The two of us! Both. We must do things properly. There, good girls, good girls. Things must be done properly, using one's head. Not using... I can't even remember what it's called. Look, we use head, too. You want to see head? Here it is. He's the one of the letter. Get in! How... Get in. You should do your best, because every mistake is expensive. So, we are here to do the very best. And you can do it. At this point... Acquire the gun sight and the sight notch. Slowly, pull, pull, pull... Slowly, Now, once again, softly... we are blank, go... Now close your eyes. Feel your arms stretched, your trunk forward, your abdominals contracted, the posture of your knees, well bent forward, your neck is naturally relaxed, and then you need to open both your eyes, you'll have a full visual field. And take that finger away! You must keep your finger out. Until you've decided to shoot, that finger must stay out! Let's see Franco... No, that's no good. Even if you're not holding it, get a grasp on that gun! The left hand goes opposite the right hand. Facing it, opposite. Make a fist with your right hand. The thumbs one on the other. Not like that. No, like before, like that, perfect. Torso forwards, feel your arm stretch, nice and tense, a good grip, no tightening. That's the hand that holds the gun. And your finger straight, nice and straight, all the time. You mustn't insert the finger until you decide to shoot. Rino. Rino. Rino. Just two minutes, they've got to give me my money back... Eventually, I had to frighten the guys. - Someone owes you money? - Yeah... It can't be. It can't be. It'd be a miracle. You don't believe in miracles? See, my friend, you've got a problem. You have no faith in your neighbour. Not even your old buddy Anes. Stupid! You should read the Bible, the Quran... Or do a bit of African religious dancing. Idiot. You need philosophy, Bilal. You need faith. Wait for me... Bilal, start the engine! Bastard! Start! You are a fool! Those people don't understand, they're boors. What are you doing? Dusting? You're really taking the lead. What's this? You didn't mean to tell me? I found it hidden in your papers. What? What? What the fuck! They're taxes! Taxes you haven't paid! Explain. When were you thinking of telling me? You're mad! You just have to shut up. What will we do? What will happen? Say something, say something. What will we do, tell me! This time, I'm not asking my brother for money. Say something, say something. Stop it! I've had it with these three shitty floors! Will you stop it with Chinese! You have to stop it with this song! Nothing is right with you! If you did anything having a bit of sense. Now one can't even sing? Great. Shall I sing you another one? How much did you say you earned? 250? Yeah. A month? Yeah, it's not much. But it can do. Yeah, well... 250. Wouldn't it be better if you brought them home? And who should I give them to? I'm keeping them anyway. If you bring them home, it's best. - 250... - Yeah, 250. Again? Yeah, 250. Why don't you give them to your mum? To me? Why should I give them to Mum? They're mine and I'm keeping them! Why should I give them to mum, who can't even keep her own money! Look out, sweetie! Yeah...Bye bye. Are you joking? What are you doing? Asking Luisa for money? He...loved seawater and sea life. He travelled, travelled in his boat. He would look at the stars in the sky. So much fog, snow. "Come, come see my ship! How beautiful, lots of sails and flags." Then they would go aboard ship and in the house. The parents knew the pirate. Happy ever after. You know what I'm thinking? What we'll be like as old men. - Who? - You and me! What a jerk! Why? I don't even want to think about it. You don't want to grow old together? Jerk! Do you think we'll still be together? I'll beat you at pool every day. But who else lets you win at pool, if not me? Where would you be without me? Yes, aunt, yes. But are you sure he'll be there at that time and place? As long as you're sure he's there, I'll wait for him. I know where the Centre for Identification is. I know it very well. Bilal? What's the matter? Shall we leave for two days? I can. I can, I'm coming. Now. Tonight. Right now. This? Your wife? Beautiful, beautiful. Blonde... Samet has been... circumcised. ...the cake. Really? Me, Bilal... no circumcision. You... In Turkey are there elephants? Yes? Elephants? But, what was it? But was it dead? Was it dead or alive? No, no, dead. How nice. Luisa and Bilal are friends. No, they're lovers. Luisa and Bilal are friends. No, they're lovers. No, it's Bilal who is spoilt because he wants to marry. No, it's not true. Bilal is free. No, he's not free. Bilal is an Albanian terrorist. Luisa is a breshkagin. What is a "breshkagin"? It's a turtle. Look, what a kitchen. Christ! Beautiful. This one looks a bit like my Granma's... No! Don't! Stop! Idea: what if we hid your cousin here? Oh, stop fooling. What, are you worried? What a face, Christ... What face? Not really sure... No, I am... Are you scared? No! But it seems easy. And if they catch us? Let's go. I like it here. Don't you want to come, too? Cousin! Perfect getaway! Lower your voice! I forgot to tell the policeman that my cousin has come to get me! Lower your voice! And who could catch us? Who cares about their documents, their residence permit... - He's Valdrin. - Luisa. Nice to meet you. He came to look for a job. He wants to do rap. Stupid, are you crazy? What are you going to do? I'll work with rap. Listen...if he likes it. No way he'll like it. Why can't I sing, what's wrong with it? He wants to sing... Show us, then. You want to hear? We went on a long journey. Thoughts in my head: where to go. To make you see I can rap, the rap we've never left, Something to understand, to go beyond, dressing like a rapper, getting that it's night. - So I'll get you drunk like a barrel! - He is good! I insist, because you don't understand, I bring you the rap. I've only understood "ketidon". Look at me with your mind and write it on the clock. How can I turn it off? You know! You know it! My darling, we're all here, all together to think to sing more and more! But you know! You know it! We are all here, to think, to think of something better to sing! Wait until we get there, we make the curves, we make the circle. Because we are like this, because we come in this way... Where have you been? Is this the way to behave? Is this the way to behave? Not a word for two days? Whatever... You talk to her. What the fuck are you man? Man up! You're half a woman like the one we saw in the square before. They suck! I'd kill myself, Rino. I'd kill myself. Only weak people kill themselves, Franco. And my daughter? She never tells me anything. I don't know where she goes. Do you know where she is? I don't. She slept outside last night. Where did she sleep? Who does she sleep with? She is a little girl. She is a little girl. I know who this is. I'll take you to see him. You're breaking my arm! It's not fair! I'm the strongest, you know! Stop! - Feet don't count! - No, I'm not using feet. You'll bite dust. Dust, you'll be biting. Please, miss! Here is a spoon of salt. Go. No, I'm joking. No! Luisa! Delicious! - Are you crazy? - It's delicious... Are you crazy? Drink water. Why not? What can I do, I can't force you to, can I? We're no longer in the rice fields. What have the rice field got to do with it? Can you imagine me with a boyfriend and seeing if you like him? Like I'd take him away from you. I wouldn't cross it out. What? Promise that if you have a boyfriend, you'll introduce us. Yeah, but from a long way off! Anybody home? We've got guests! Good evening. Good evening. You could have told me. The friend wanted to try the way I cook snails. He pressed me so much... I'll show you, Menon! Tonight, Franco Carnielo is cooking. Keep an eye on the critters. What strange critters. They look shy, yet once they peek out, they never go back into their shells. All hell's broken loose over here... Menon came to my place. He's always wanting to talk to my father. I don't know why. Look, Menon is already framed. No, it's not Menon who's framed now, you know darn well who's been framed: it's Bilal. When you talk about Bilal you don't understand anything. Tell me what the real problem is. You don't give a fuck we're putting up shitty creek someone who has nothing to do with it. Go fuck your mother! We were supposed to be together in this. We should have shown the arsehole up, taken the money and go, it was all straight. You and me against the world. And now? You and me, what? Yeah, you and me against the world. Against what world? Where on earth would we go? Where is it we're going? Doing what? Where are we going? What world? What world! You know what? I'll do it all on my own. Drop dead! Fuck you! I bought you a small something, nothing special. I saw it in a stationer's window. I think it's nice. I wish nothing had happened. It's always been a game between you and me. Your friend and the Albanian... nothing to do with it. They were just an excuse. The most important thing was you and me. What the fuck where you thinking? God said, "Let us make human beings in our image, to be like us. They will reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on the earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. Then God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground." God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. Word of God. Amen. Excuse me. You're the one in the photos, right? No, wait! Just a second, come here. Come here, darling. Keep calm. Come, I've only got to talk to you. Come darling, don't be scared. Listen... I'm the pig's sister. And this... is all I have to give to you. Over! Over! Understood? Clear? Don't break our balls any more. I don't want this money, understood. I'm not giving you anymore! - Is this clear? - Take it! Take the money! You take the money! You all make me puke! Fool! You're just a fool. An idiot. Look at you. You think I'm sorry for you? Now I'm going to your friend Bilal and I'm telling him everything, that blind shit! I'm telling him everything now. I don't feel like quarrelling with you, it's not worth it. You're a slag! What a shitty friend. - Oh, mum. - What? What's the matter with you? Baby, baby... what? Oh, mum. What's going on? What? Stop. And where were you? Near there. Go away! Go away! I didn't want to get involved! Fuck you! What the fuck do you want? - Sorry! - You say it now. You say it now. It was just for the cash! Sorry, I didn't want to, I didn't want to! You didn't want to? Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you and the pervs you screw! What's happening? - Luisa! - Ma'am... - Mum... - Your daughter.... - Say what you did! - Shut up! Tell her what you did! What do you want? What do you want? - What do you want? - Tell her what you did. Who are you? What do you want? Go home, Mum! Nigger! Nigger! Coward! Keep calm! - Enough! - Nigger! Go away! Coward! Down on the ground! - Luisa! - Down on the ground! - Arsehole! - What happened? Coward! Come down! What was that? Rino was right: we got to burn them all! What's Rino Menon got to do with it? What are you saying? - Give me the keys of your car! - No! Now you're going to explain! Lock yourself in your room, I said! Tell me! - You have broken my balls! - What are you doing? You're crazy! You're crazy! I'll break the glass! Are you asleep? Come see what your friend did. Bilal... He's not here! But who are you? Anes! He'll be here sooner or later... I was shot at the door. Were you shot at the door? Yeah, the coward did it. He put his hands on my daughter. Those two were screaming in the street. You've had enough, old buddy. I only wanted to be kind. Tell me what she did. No, you must do something for her. She can't be like all the others. Can I help you? Make everything go back. To when? Dad! - Is that your father? - Yes. And why has he got a gun?
