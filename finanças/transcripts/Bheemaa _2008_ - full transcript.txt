Chennai populated with 10 millions, people from various places settle here for various jobs, this city gets busier and complicated with every passing day, It's a concrete jungle. Beyond the fun & joy seen on the face of this city, many things are happening unseen, none of them happening in this shadow world can be justified, but behind every incident, there is a reason, and with it an untold story. Chandru, not seen for 2 days. Few people came for you. They inquired about you. I couldn't ever offer them a tea. Ask them what they want. - Where is Bahadur? - I don't know. You were together for 2 days. I don't know. - There is nothing you don't know. - I don't know. - You changed 3 rooms in a day. - No. - Where did you drop him? - I don't know. You know. Tell me. I'll blow your brains out. Are you new boys in the block? Settle score with him, if you've any, what did his family do? An 18 year old girl jumped out of the train & killed herself in fear. Look at her father's face. Do you know what were her grades? For you, all lives are same. I will kill you. Tell me where is Bahadur. I'll tell you. Shahul's shop in Pondy Bazaar. Samy... I'll take care, Seth. Trust me. Stop pestering me. Tell him. Calling so many times for a silly job? It may turn against us. What's that noise? Shiva... Nagu... Somebody overtook us. Anyway, he had to die. Let's not be here. His murder will come into our account. Chinna, let's go. Looks like you bumped off Bahadur yesterday. We didn't kill him. Your jeep was in the street corner, you went to his house. How could you deny it? I don't mind accepting the truth. We didn't kill him. I heard you're preparing a new hit list. You're changing rules overnight silently. Transferred 12 IPS officers overnight. What's going on? Our information reaches you first before us. You will eliminate us if we lag a step behind. I came for something else. We caught a fish in our net. Your boy Palanivel was arrested in Coimbatore 2 days back. He has turned approver. He will be produced in court tomorrow. If he starts singing, not only you, everyone will get caught. Take care. - Yes Chinna. - Samy, any problem? Can we kill him? No problem. We are here. The train hasn't arrived yet. Police have swarmed the place. Let him come. I will kill him. You don't worry. Attention passengers! Train no. 2676 Kovai Express coming to Chennai via Tirupur, Erode & Salem, will arrive at platform No:5 shortly. Train no. 2676 Kovai Express coming to Chennai via Tirupur, Erode & Salem, An important message! Due to unavoidable reasons, - Listen the announcement. - Kovai express will arrive at platform No: 7. Fast. Come fast. What's happening? Come... Go. He's gone. Go. Who is he? Where did he come from? He is crossing our path. Is he trying to scare us? Whose man is he? Where is he from? Any left out enemy? Chinna, totally confused. I don't understand. Everything is new. We shouldn't go empty handed while visiting big shots. So, I brought you a gift you want. Some answer calling their name. Some answer snap of fingers. I wanted to attract your attention. So, all this stuff. I killed Bahadur too. Who are you? Why are you doing all this? Just for fun. - Aren't you scared? - You haven't shot me. What do you want? Beat those who do wrong. Else kill them. I want to do it along with you. That's all. Nothing more. He is a crook. Come... Is he a man with one face? Or with two faces? But he's an enigma... He's fearless... Hey Mani. His eyes are so sharp... and he'll charm you in a blink... His body is painless... Is he a man with one face? Or with two faces? But he's an enigma... He's fearless... His eyes are so sharp... and he'll charm you in a blink... His body is painless... He takes lightning decisions... Takes rests in the lap of thunders... Kills with his deadly punches... Follows like a shadow... He remains an enigma... Eliminates enemies with mercurial moves... Leaves a trail of dead behind... He's a walking raging fire... The world wakes at dawn... but his gun spills bullets... Some times his acts are justified... Next moment he vanishes into thin air... Give him the keys. Is he a man with one face? Or with two faces? But he's an enigma... He's fearless... His eyes are so sharp... and he'll charm you in a blink... His body is painless... - Brother. - What dear? You must name her. - Padma. - Nice name. Tell me. I will blow you. Hello. He is not the one. Another person will come. You must kill him. Don't get tensed. Reddy's lifeline is too strong. Thanks brother. He loves rocking music... Loves a happy heart... His punches are deadly... He is the King of nights... He acts instantly... He loves playing with dangers... His moves are lightning fast... Even roses lose a shade looking at his soft face... Deep in his heart, you can hear the roars of a lion... He takes things easily... He eats enemies for lunch... Is he a man with one face? Or with two faces? But he's an enigma... He's fearless... His eyes are so sharp... and he'll charm you in a blink... His body is painless... O handsome! You stole this damsel's heart, tell me your views... O handsome! You sparked the flame of love in me, tell me that secret... I yearn for you at night... I was not in station for 2 days. Look, house is a mess. Things are lying all over the place. She is soon to get married. How will she run a home? Everyone will blame me. - Suchi, come here. - What? Last night a man entered our house. - Oh no! Who? - I don't know. It was around 10 pm. I was rehearsing the song. - I looked up & he fell on me. - On you? - I was clueless. - She thinks I am mad. I informed her father, but no use. Where am I to complain now? What happened then? He fell on me. Pushed vessels. We rolled over. Spill water. I didn't know what to do. And my long skirt... Long skirt? Forget it. Leave it, it's nothing. No. You're hiding something. I'm not hiding anything. I did nothing. Both are insensitive. They don't treat me as human. - Come. - Where? - Come I say. - Why? - What? - Sit down. Tell me what it is. - What is it? - He left it here. Is it a real gun? Will it fire? Who knows? What are you doing there? What are you going to do with it? Let's throw it in the sea. - Buddy, a great chick. - Where? O sexy eyes! My world revolves around you. When your photo brushes my heart, my thoughts buzz around you. Want to learn fishing? - Learn it from him. - Leave me alone. Forget about fish. - Let's teach her to catch crabs. - Better listen to me. You tell me. I will listen. Go away or else I will fire at you. Look. It's a toy gun. C'mon, shoot me. Shoot me here. - Buddy, it's a real gun. - Escape. Program cancelled. Let it be with us. Samy, I'm forced to see him. You should've inquired before. We've come to mourn a death. We can't ask the record of mourners. Who is he? Why did you leave midway? Tell him, Samy. Did you see him, father? You let him go. We should've killed him long back. You saw how everyone stood up on his arrival. Most important man in the city. An evil power that decides the fate of this city. - Did you see how he was sitting? - Leave it. What can he do? From peddling drugs in colleges to import & export of smuggled goods, everything happens on his command. They are not like before. They are now acting differently. In this month they killed around 15 of our men. I saved his life 4 times. Whatever he owns now must have been ours. But one day, they dropped me like hot potato. He will die in our hands. They tried to kill me after that. But they failed. The right time hasn't come. That's all. Our enmity still continues. Let's see. O handsome! You stole this damsel's heart, tell me your views... O handsome! You sparked the flame of love in me, tell me that secret... I yearn for you at night... without anyone's knowledge... What's wrong with her? She has bungled everything. Lights off. You rehearsed for 10 days. But of no use. What can I do? It's all because of him. Who? The man who entered our house. He came & spoiled everything. I didn't know what to do. I see him in everyone or anything I see. I feel as if he's standing before me. Okay, you deserve all this. Leave me. - Hey Suji, come here. - No. I am leaving. - Hey Suji. - What? - Come here. Look there. - Who? I said about a man entering home. That's the guy. You mean the one getting beaten up. Not the victim but the attacker. Is it yours? Yes, this is it. He is beating everyone. Must be a notorious goon. Is he a goon if bashes up people? Who knows what they had done? Never judge hearing one side. He's sporting a beard too. Just a beard. He appears very serious guy. Is he MGR to fight with a smile? Why are you justifying his every move? If a man falls on a young girl at night when alone at home, rolls over & over again and she holding stripping long skirt, it's a big torture. You won't understand that. One must experience it. My nights are sleepless. So, you like him. If you like him, its okay with me. My secret dreams chimed and touched my eyelids... Youth is ecstatic... My heart is slipping away... Like the first full moon... your image is embedded on my heart... I'll read you with my lips... Stay quiet for a moment... Getting lost in love is divine... Caress me with the peacock feather... When you caress me, my joy knows no bounds and my secrets unfold... Caress me with the peacock feather... When you caress me, my joy knows no bounds and my secrets unfold... I was born again... When you touched, I blushed... You're the meaning of unspoken words... You're the warmth of a kiss on my sensitive places... Like the shade of a tree in hot sun... you engulf me in your arms... My touch relieved the pain of your heart... My secret dreams chimed and touched my eyelids... Youth is ecstatic... My heart is slipping away... All my cells chant your name... Your memories incite the fire in me... You're the garden of henna which turns me blushing red... You're my pillow to rest... When you come closer, won't this damsel break apart? You touch me with those sins of pleasure... so, you are a handsome beast... My secret dreams chimed and touched my eyelids... Youth is ecstatic... My heart is slipping away... Caress me with the peacock feather... When you caress me, my joy knows no bounds and my secrets unfold. Caress me with the peacock feather... When you caress me, my joy knows no bounds and my secrets unfold. Caress me with the peacock feather... When you caress me, my joy knows no bounds and my secrets unfold. My God! Why are you following me? What's this nonsense? Shouldn't anyone walk on the road? So many are coming behind me. Can I accuse them of following me? And so many are going before me. If everyone questions me like you, I can't help them. You're walking on the road I am using. That's all. I'm not following you. You're are going before me. We both are in the same path. Am I right, Suji? Nothing. Destroy all the shops. Leave nothing behind. Destroy it. Don't interfere in this matter. This is the old man's issue. He bought this land. He's planning a shopping mall here. We told these beggars many times. But they never listened to us. So, we are razing it down. Don't interfere. Leave this place. - What if I interfere? - No. You know how old man will react. What bloody old man? We are here for the past 40 years. We paid corporation taxes and electricity bills. The case is in court. Let court order us. We will vacate. What bloody old man? Does he have two horns? You old hag... You hit me! How dare you hit me? Wait here. Come boys. Let's go. There is nothing to worry. Let them come. You talk. I'm Samy speaking. Yes. Sekar hit a man here. It has lead to trouble, wherever you may be, come here immediately. This is injustice. They demolished mercilessly. They are planning to encroach entire land. We earn a few bucks toiling day and night, Our life depends on it. They are trying to take it away. Let them come. I can handle them. Let them come. You guys are late. He bashed them single handedly. - How many shops are there? - 300 shops. - No sir. Only 300 shops. - 301. Including Chinna's shop. If you have any problems, fear not. Do your business as usual without any fear. If anyone troubles you, I will take care of them. We will stand by you. Let's go. Sekar, come & sit. You drive the car. What's it Sivaraman? - Go & get that. - Just a minute. A small mistake. What happened? Chinna crossed our path. We couldn't do anything. What are you saying? Take our boys & beat him. Not just Chinna, there is a new guy with him. His name is Sekar. He's beating in different style. His blows are deadly. How dare you praise an enemy? Spinning new stories about them? Go & tell this to my father. He is upstairs. If you go now, he will kill you. Don't tell him about this. - Give me time. I'll finish him. - Okay. Go. Let's go boys. Who is he? Where did he come from? I feel like I'm seeing myself 25 years younger. But 10 times stronger. He's a one man demolition squad. I've lost fear. Now I'm very confident. My enemies are nothing to me anymore. I feel someone is here to stand by me through thick & thin. He is no ordinary man. He is different. There is something unique in his flesh & blood. His looks are different. He isn't doing anything silly. He's doing something but different. What are you saying, Chinna? I'm not a stranger. You're my first hero. You're the first real man I saw. You first gave me the log. Rameshwaram No one can open the shop. Close the shop. What are you doing here? Go. Selling shells? I'll cut your throat. Close the shop. Should I tell you separately? We are born for this. Why have you opened your shop? - We came to temple. - Then, what are you doing here? Get lost. Why are you staring at me? Run. What are you watching at? Get lost. Go. It's for you too. None of you will reach home. I'll smash your ear drums. Boss... Go. Krishnamurthy, he is creating a havoc before your station. Won't you straighten him up? If we take him to custody, people will raise slogans against us. If you take him to task, it's a different story. He deserved to be punished. - Well done. - Okay. Will Chinna beat everyone? Not everyone. He will punish anyone who commits a crime. He never forgives criminals. Does Chinna fear anyone? Fear? He doesn't know what it is. He is different. Chinna studied in the same school where I studied. Chinna played in the same ground where I played. It made me feel very happy. Though my school was near to home, I would across 4 streets to see Chinna. I like his style, his walk, his talk & his warns. I try to stand like Chinna. I tried walking like him. I even tried warning like him. When I hear the bike sound, I think it is Chinna. - They stole money & attacked me. - Stop crying. I don't like people crying. Take him. Catch him. - No. - Go... Greetings boss. Come in. Watch the movie & then go. No. Everyone is watching the film. I will watch it another day. Screen the movie from the start. - Come in. - Okay. When I was watching the film, the film was screened again from the beginning for Chinna. After that, I kept watching him and not the film. You said your exams are due next week. - But roaming with me without studying. - I've read everything. - Father... - Why are you hitting my son? - Father... father... - You said he won't take. Look, he took all that I gave him. We must give him in proper way for him to accept. - Why? - It's a family business. I can't quit the business for your sake. What's all this injustice? Take it. I earned peddling drugs. You buy medicines. Ruining my business! Let's go. Father... That incident hurt my father. He really felt very bad. He didn't want anyone to know that a policeman was beaten up. It's reflection of his honesty. My father never slept that night. Me too. Is your father at home or not? Look, he is staring at me. Tell him not to come there. Tell him to be loyal for the money he took. What? I was only thinking about Chinna then. Chinna comes where there is injustice. I wanted Chinna to come here. I knew it was Chinna who is coming. So, I never looked back. Boy, get me that log. Get it. How dare you hit a policeman? How dare you hit a policeman? If I see you brewing arrack again... - Run... run. - Leave me. After that, I really felt very confident & bold. One day, my seniors quarreled with me in a football match. I thought of Chinna and hit him hard once. His had a bloodied face. I wanted Chinna see me hitting that boy. After that, if I felt something wrong, I beat everyone. Chinna is right. I decided what Chinna does is justice. Samy, he has chased me from so long. He is Head constable Krishnamurthy's son. Come. We've been to North Madras and South Madras. - I touched you. - No, you didn't. - Touch me. - Careful. Watch now. - I did touch you. - No, you didn't. Who are you? Why are you beating us? - Don't beat us while talking. - Come boys. I'll come with my men. How dare you hit me! I will show you who I am. Go. You hit them. They have left their bikes here. What if they come back again? Go. Don't keep going. I've little shopping to do. Stop... stop. Wait. What are you doing? Cornetto. Rs.20 Want a bite? Stop... stop. Sorry. Catch. Finish. Surprised? There is no big reason. Just for fun. I like doing it. Stop... stop. Looks like you will drop me home? 4th house from here. Brown colour gate. No: 33 Father's name is Subramaniam. He is working in TVS. The little one who comes with me. She is Suji. I've a grandma at home. All that doesn't matter. My phone no: 942405056 Don't call me often & irritate me. Don't come home. Forget everything. Okay. You can go. Bye. I know. He will come. And he will forget nothing. He likes all that I like. My dear, love is a dream, love is an epic. Love is a portrait. Joy & happiness overflows in our heart. It leaves us with a variety of tastes. Chinna, I often used to see you in bangles Street. - How? Our head master's house. I go to him for tuition. Padma sister. I know. I've seen. I've seen you both together. You both used to travel in bike. - I know. - What do you know? - The entire village knows. - Drive properly. Okay. What is it Chinna? It's alright. Tell me. Everything has changed. Why dig my past? We both are different. Who knows where she is now. I don't know. - Did you meet her again? - Me? No way. I've taken a one way road. Life has changed a lot. Why take left? Go right. - Everything is going right. - Where are you going? Wait. Where are you taking me to? To the right place. Are you playing with me? - Where are you going? - Get down. Come. - Chinna... - What? Why did you bring me here suddenly? Come with me. - Go & talk to her. Come. - Take the car. - Leave me. - Come Listen to me, Chinna. - Are you coming or not? - No way. Will you talk to her or not? You don't worry. He ran away in confusion. When I talked about you, he started blushing. Where will he go? I will take care. Sekar, if he is not interested, why force him? Nothing like that. I will take care of him. Bye. Bye sister. Moolakadai boys are dangerous. Sekar is very bad. He took me to her suddenly. I told him about my past. He took me there & I saw Padma. I was shell shocked. Is it any age to marry? - In this situation. - What's wrong in it? Is it your 10th marriage? Your 1st marriage. What's wrong in it? It's my mistake to have told you. You needn't support him. - You need a break. He is right. - What right? Get lost. Joining the chorus. Move... Is he shouting at you? Wait for me. You know nothing, Samy. When I inquired about her, he felt so shy. His heart developed wings to fly. He was tapping dashboard on hearing song. Trying to cheat me? I know everything. He is trying to hide feelings. Come here. Why did you name his daughter as Padma? Why not some other name? Ask him. It was just a slip of tongue. So what? If it wasn't in your heart, how could you get that name? Look. Your daughter's name is not Padma. Change the name. Go. Okay. We will change the girl's name. But the girl is Padma. You must convince him. Only then he will listen. Boys do anything you say. Now listen to them. Samy has ordered. We will make it a grand affair. I don't hear anything. I'm deaf. Sekar, where is the marriage? Isn't there a big party? Party, song & dance. A cocktail party on the sea. O miss Rangamma! Is your body made out of gold? O miss Thangamma! I'm considered to be very lucky... O miss Rangamma! Is your body made out of gold? O miss Thangamma! I'm considered to be very lucky... She is one in a million... She torches our desires... She kidnaps innocent souls... With a blink of her eye, the sea went up in flames... Blow the whistle & tear the ear drums... Blow the whistle & tear the ear drums... O miss Rangamma! Is your body made out of gold? O miss Thangamma! I'm considered to be very lucky...

With a blink of her eyes, the sea went up in flames... Blow the whistle and tear the ear drums... Blow the whistle and tear the ear drums... Blow the whistle and tear the ear drums... Blow the whistle and tear the ear drums... He left child behind. A promising life ended abruptly. Chinna, we interfered in their market issue. Sivaraman & his brother are responsible for this. They left my boys float in blood. Not one of them should be alive. Sekar, you... Boss, I'm Kumar here. Sekar barged inside... - Hey guys, where are you? - Boss, what's the matter? It seems Sekar has entered. Be careful. I'm with our boys... very secure... All boys are together. He can't do harm them. All are very secure... Hubby... Go elsewhere with your family. I refused you... but didn't listen to me... My men forced me to marry you. I don't want you to see this bloodshed... You've seen it all on day one. Are you happy now? I know my position. Padma, you can't even sleep peacefully one night here. Hubby, what a mess your house is in? No water facility... Kitchen is a mess. I should set right everything first. I stayed in a hostel most of my life. So, I'm finding it difficult to cook. I've just managed to cook something. Do you like it? What are you talking? Are you any stranger to me? Don't I know your profession and its gore? I know everything. Hubby, I haven't come live with you for eons. Just a day with you is enough, I'll accept death happily. - Can you do me a favour? - What? Keep your work & worries out of our bedroom, that's enough. I expect only this from you! Oh no! Why are you running like this? Such a long distance! Won't you turn back? I got fed up! I can't run any more. Impossible for me! Got tired! Order a juice for me. By the way, who is he? Hey, what do you want now? Didn't I order for a juice? Why are you torturing me unnecessarily? What? Am I torturing you? First you came to my house and fell on me. Young men ogling girls at bus stop is common. That's natural. Why did you beat them for that? That's why I hopped onto your bike. Else, why would I come with you? Where is my juice? Can I meet you in your house? I can meet you only outside. I heard somebody calling you 'Sekar'. Only then, I came to know your name... I'm talking only to you... Why are you turning that side? I'll blow your brains out! You don't know about me. If I see you again following me... You will die! Why is Sivaraman's line dead? Father, they killed Sivaraman. Who? Chinna. They interfered in market yard. We thought of solving it without involving you. Everything went haywire, father. They cleaned up our entire group. What do you mean? What are you talking, man? Who is he? If he crosses our line, will you just leave him? He has done this against us. What were you all doing? Why do you hide everything? Who is he? Don't do anything. You can't tackle him. Father, I'll teach them a lesson. I won't spare them alive. They will die! I'll call men from outside. They will perfectly finish the job. We won't be linked to it. I'll see to it, father. Show it in action. Yes, tell me. Just a minute. - Sekar, where? - 3rd floor. Yes tell me... We can do it. What problem is there? He is an acquaintance. What's this? Please get up. Sorry sir. No, just taking the cell. You move... are you okay? - He is our engineer. - I don't know... sorry... You please carry on. Will you beat anyone without giving a second thought? No, Chinna... How do I know that you know him? Suddenly he came and placed hand on you... I got confused and beat him... When I turned back. Chinna... Chinna... Shit! Chinna... Chinna... Chinna... It's nothing... let's go... What happened to you Chinna? Chinna, nothing will happen to you... Nothing to worry... let's go... Look Chinna, sit here. Nothing will happen to you... I'm here with you... Look at me, Chinna. Just a minute... bear the pain... have confidence. Chinna, don't worry. I'm with you. I'm with you. I'll be back now. Come on... come... Wait Chinna... wait... Come on... come... Wait, I'll come now... Come on... come... Wait, I'll come now, Chinna. Come on... Nothing will happen to you. Let's go. Nothing will happen to my Chinna. I won't allow it to happen. If anything happens to him... Why are you standing here? Nothing will happen to him. Chinna hates crying, doesn't he? Come on... listen to me... come... What happened? He hasn't regained consciousness. He won't regain consciousness. I don't want answers. I want the result. I hate incomplete missions. Tomorrow when I wake up, only I must be here. No rival must be alive. You can go now. Are you surprised to get up here? Life has no guarantee. Despite of your tight security, he managed to kidnap you. Everybody here has a gun. Anybody can kill anyone. If you're so vengeful at this age, how vengeful should I be then? But I'm not ruthless like you. Since I was with you once, I had respect for you. But it got washed away with the blood I spilled yesterday. Now I've no respect for you. The life you're enjoying now is my generous gift to you. I don't want to take it back. I don't want your life. I don't like your activities. Men with you and their deals. You must stop everything. If you maintain the code, I'll not trouble you. Decide yourself. No pardons next time. Let's go, Sekar. If you cross Chinna's path again, Next time I'll not miss, I'll hit your forehead. Elderly man, where do you want to go? - I want to go to Boat club. - Boat club? Where is it? - Adyar. What Old man? Still in the hangover mood? You're in Kancheepuram and want to go to Adyar. - Kancheepuram? - Yes. It will cost Rs.2000. Is it okay? Get in. Old man, pay the fare. Hello... - What happened father? - What happened dad? Where were you? - Tell me, what happened, father? - Hey, move... Tell me, father. Tell me, father... - Father, tell me... - Where were you? Do you want the world to know it? - Close the door... - Do you want the world to know it? He kidnapped me. He kidnapped me overnight. He took me to some god forsaken place and insulted me. Hey, where were you? Where did you all go away? - Hey, I'll kill him today. - Wait... - Leave me... Either one of us must live. I'll finish him today. - Hey stop it... - Leave me, brother. Won't you cool down? Father, listen to me. Now they aren't weak like before. Chinna knows our strengths and weaknesses. Now, Chinna is not alone. Situation is quite different now. Yes father... Sekar, his new lieutenant is no ordinary guy. Father, I don't want to rub them on wrong side and help them grow powerful. Hey, were you born to our father? Hey, were you born to our father? He left our father, hasn't he? Leave it. He kidnapped our father overnight. You want me to spare him? I'm telling you, isn't it? Leave it. He left our father, hasn't he? He must regret for it. - I'll show our power to them. - Wait... - Leave me... Hey, don't stop him. Let him go. Let him go. That is... excuse me... Forget about it, tell me this... Hello. Sami, can you hear me? I'm Mani speaking. Hello. Yes tell me. Sami, enemies entered our home. You be careful. It's noisy here. Unable to hear you. Come on, kill him... Kill everyone. Don't leave anyone. Go and search there... go... Hey, come out... Come out... Where are you? Shit! Hey, where are you? Come out... Where are you? Hey, come out... come out... Sami, take care... - What happened to you? - Nothing. What happened to you? - It's okay, Chinna. Just blood... nothing will happen to me. You didn't see him... You don't know what he did. They started playing wrong game. - You're hurt. - This isn't a big deal, Chinna. Hereafter, we shouldn't spare anyone at any cost. We must change the game plan. Not a vehicle is coming out of harbour. Power has changed. His men have taken over the place. Lie... Everything is a big lie. All men are not equals. We are not hired killers. That old man is best for you. Go to him. One minute... Our men will be there. You won't face any problem. We will manage. You can go now. Why Narayanan has joined their ranks? He's a traitor. He must be in the business, right? There should be movement, right? Nobody fears you any more. Everything has changed. Still what Narayanan did was wrong. That's why I came to inform you. Shit! Is brother there? He's gone! I think nobody is as loyal to you as Chinna was. Your men are duds. Either it must blow before entering or after getting down. Time is crucial for a time bomb. You can't even take Chinna's hair leave alone his life when I'm here. He has left... you can sit now. Only our voice counts here. There is no to go against us. Chinna, you're right, nobody can dare challenge us. Sami, come here... What's going on here sir? There's blood, gore, and gang war in this city. How people can live peacefully here? 13 murders In 3 months, 8 amongst them were notorious goons. All were killed in full public glare, was the police watching fun? Please gentlemen... I'll answer all your questions. Yeah... please... We don't want your answers. We want only action! You're the new Commissioner, - what's your plan of action? - Nothing. I'm also confused like you on the happenings in this city. Don't you read newspapers sir? We publish crime news everyday with photos. No crime happens without the knowledge of public and press. Public fear criminals. They go dumb. Press adulate criminals as heroes. Like EB and Transport, Police is also a govt. Department. We can't react instantly. You were specially flown in from Mumbai for this post, how can you be so irresponsible? We too are ordinary mortals like you, Police man too has a family. We are not supernatural powers. But don't worry. We will do our best. No... please... Yeah... I'm coming... I'm on the way. Sir, you were right in the press meet. - Really? - Yes sir. What can a police man do? Criminals have modern guns. We have old 303 guns. Criminals travel in foreign cars, we have to chase them in old, rusty jeeps at 40 kms. More over many formalities to buy petrol or paper, we too have family, haven't we sir? How can we be fearless? - You were right sir! - Wasn't I? What are you looking at? If you were worried about family, Why did you choose this profession? Cowards like have encouraged the criminals' growth. First you must be weeded out. Have you become a police man to salute criminals? This is not a 9 to 5 job. Hunt. Tiger hunt. If you don't hunt tiger, it will hunt you. Got it? A cop must be enigmatic. Understand? Put on the button. Come... Sorry. Carry on... Sir, the list is ready. There are 2 gangs in the city. Chinna's gang and another lead by Old man. Chinna was aloof of Old man till now, has grown very powerful. This happened after the arrival of Sekar into Chinna's fold. So, Sekar is the power behind Chinna's growth. He's the Bheema carrying entire weight of the gang on his shoulders. Okay. What can we do now? Sir, there is only one way. Very simple. Shoot at sight. Sir, that won't work out. Greenhorns, it shows their enthusiasm, we can't kill at will. There are umpteen formalities. Human Rights may interfere, we may have to answer some hard questions. No... I agree with them. Young blood! They are right. I want the city clean. That's all! Shoot them. Who will dare question us? This is not official but unofficial. Public shouldn't be disturbed. No need to account bullets used. - What was his name? - Sekar sir. You used a name to praise him? Yes Bheema... We are the Angels of death for all the Bheemas in this place. This operation is code named as 'Operation Bheema'. Flush out goons from this city. Eliminate everyone Who is Mani here? Who is it? - Tell me... - Boss... Hey, that girl is here. Hey move... What do you want? Didn't I warn you not to follow me? Why have you come here now? What do you want? Can't you understand? - You're attracting people. - You shut up. 25, 26, 27, and 28 are our seats. You are sitting in the wrong seats. I am not here to see you. I am here to watch film. She is right, Sekar. - We are sitting in wrong seats. - I'll punch you! Go... Can't you check numbers? Won't you check it properly? What's it Sekar? - You want anything? - Nothing. - You turned to me. - Watch the movie. He is trying to say something, but hiding it from me. First time I got wet in rain... First time the closed windows opened for me... An unknown bird called me... My heart responded with flying... My heart floated gently... First time I got wet in rain... First time the closed windows opened for me... An unknown bird called us... My heart responded with flying... My heart floated gently... You are like a dream... I captured you with my eyes... Yesterday my threshold was fragrant with your fragrance... I realised you dropped in... It was like a meaningless new poem... Today I understood its meaning... Like a restless umbrella in hand... I flew away with breeze... First time I got wet in rain... First time the closed windows opened for me... An unknown bird called me... My heart responded with flying... My heart floated gently... The day I don't see you isn't a day in my life... The day I meet you, I find 24 hours is too short for a day... I'm on cloud nine day and night... I'm always in bliss... Our union of hearts... Even death can't break it... It's eternal... An unknown bird called me... My heart floated gently... Department is in the worst situation. New Commissioner is very rude. He treats everyone equally. He can't differentiate good and bad. He has given full freedom to fire. All are well trained boys. Cops killed 'Korukkupettai' Ravi and 'Acid' Mani. So, you may be become next target. Chinna, please be careful. - Sekar, do you want gravy? - Yes. Eat. - Sekar... - Yes. Yesterday I met DIG. It seems their attention is on us. It seems their guns are aimed at us. I've informed our boys. - You also... - Sister, Rasam is excellent. I'm talking to you only. I've asked boys to calm down for sometime. Are you scared Chinna? Not scared, I want to be careful. Let's wait and see. Let's find their grouse. I don't like it. Why don't you listen to him? Calm down. Using her to threaten me? Eat. I saw yesterday too. Trust me... Why is he torturing me like this? Hey, first remove the goggles. - Sekar, do you believe in ghosts? - Ghost? - Yes. I smell jasmine flowers every midnight. A flower selling girl may have passed the side. - I heard anklets sound also. - May be a milkmaid. I'm couldn't sleep in fear. She put her legs on me. - Ghosts don't have legs, do they? - You don't know anything. - Hey, don't get emotional... - Hey, why are you laughing? - Am I joking here? Laughing? - Hey, stop it... - Look at him. Laughing at me. - You tell me... Sekar, it's nothing. He is sleeping with a new girl every night. Without knowing that... I'm dying in fear... - Are you talking about girls? - May be. Few drinks go in and truth comes out. - Hey... - What? Commissioner in downstairs. - Didn't Chinna warn us? Let's not tell Sekar. Come let's go. Sekar, let's go. - We came just now, didn't we? - Give me the bill. - Drinks haven't yet made me tipsy. - Let's have drinks on the way. - This is too much... - Come, let's go. Listen to me... - Is this why you wanted to leave? - No Sekar... - Listen to me, let's go... - Hey, move. - Leave it man... - Hey, I'll give punch you. It's enough. Let's go... We'll go but after meeting him. Don't want, Sekar. Sekar, let's leave. Sekar, let's go... listen to me. Hello Mr. Commissioner... Sekar, don't go there... Sekar, no... What are you looking at sir? I'm Sekar. It seems you want me shot dead. Go ahead, do it. You want me dead on sight. Come on, fire at me. Forgotten to bring your gun? - Take my gun... - Hey... keep it inside. What man? What's our crime? You look down on us like cheap criminals. You want to dispose us like street dogs? I'm Sekar, sir. You need permission to fire. But I don't need anyone's permission to fire. I've heard about you. My father was also a cop. Head constable. Lived a useless life! He is dead. I got a police job. What can I do with it? I rejected it. Do what I feel and think is right. My kind of justice is instant justice. I hate inquiries and investigations. - Deliver instant punishment. - Sekar... - What man? What? Did I fire at him? I am still talking... then? I'm drunk so they fear I may fire at you. Okay, keep it with you. Don't talk. Read my lips now. I hate family and children. I'll kill and walk away. Yes sir, let's go. Commissioner sir, I'm a bad man. He's worse than me. He will fire in a blink and walk away. If he plans, he'll demolish everything. Everybody isn't same. We are different. Don't meddle with us. Sorry... sorry... - Come, let's go. - Okay, finished. Let's celebrate. Dance and come for me... Come, let's have fun... How rashly he drives a car! - Can't you see them? - Move... Call auto... take her immediately... What happened? I may have fallen on applying sudden brake and got injured. What happened to you? Hey Sekar... Hey, come here... Come fast... Come here... Put it down... Look there... My girl... its been happening for 3 months now. Have you found it out? I didn't mean that. Look there. That wall... that string... dew drops... Why are you looking at me? Look there. There is a string, isn't it? A small flower in the middle. A flower bloomed. Hey, a 'flower'. Flower. Have you fallen in love? You're talking about one flower! Yesterday, I had with me a basket of flowers for 24 hours. Just Rs.1500. I got dead tired. That's why I was resting. You disturbed my sleep... What am I telling you and what are you telling me? - This is different. - What is it called then? Wait. - The same house... - Yes, the same house. - Same bed... - Yes same bed... - But sleeping differs. Same window... Same flower... But it appears different. I don't know how to explain you. I'm hit with strange thoughts. But I feel like I'm born again. I'm expressing my feelings... are you sleeping? - Do I need this early morning? - You... What are you doing here? I just came to see you. Oh no! Why did you come here? I was living in my world. But now I'm restless. I never felt like this before. I'm sleepless, no proper food. My heart is going crazy. Why is it so? I can't take it anymore. Oh damsel! You captured me with a glance... I want to lie in your lap... Oh damsel! You captured me with a glance... I want to lie in your lap... You're a distant dream... You're my long desire... You're a jasmine in disguise... Island of flowers... Shall I enter your home like a dragon fly? Shall I kiss you in sleep? Shall I kiss you in sleep? Oh damsel! You captured me with a glance... I want to lie in your lap. Oh damsel! In my lap... Oh damsel! In my lap... You're like a boat of clouds floating on steep hills... You're a smiling moon... Shyness is stopping me... It's not allowing me to jump the fence... When you come near me, nothing can stop me... To swing on your heart... Is it a lullaby to my manhood? You're an angel come down for me... You landed down to make love with me. Oh my Hero! You captured me with a glance... I want to lie in your lap... You're the fresh leaf of a sprouting plant... You're the sweetness of sugarcane... I lost myself in dreamy nights... Woke up in dreams... You were in my dream, so I never came out of the dream... A pair of gentle whiffs of fresh air breezed past me... You lied they were legs... Your love kills me but still I desire it... Oh damsel! You captured me with a glance... I want to lie in your lap... You're a distant dream... You're my long desire... You're a jasmine in disguise... Island of flowers... Shall I enter your home like a dragon fly? Shall I kiss you in sleep? Shall I kiss you in sleep? Hey Sekar, wait. Hubby, look there. That white compound... that flower... Don't say just a flower... It's not like that... look at that flower... Below the string... a beautiful flower... Only he can beautifully tell about a flower. Come on, tell me. Take it... Take it... Hey, give it to me. Isn't it for me? Not for you. For me. Today is my birthday. That's why, this treat. Anyway you'll not buy me anything. So, I bought the gift myself to present myself. Is it for that? I'll be back in minute. Where are you going? Sir, what do you want? Tell me, sir. What do you want? For a girl... I want to... Get something... Love? No... Sir, ask her... She has 2 boy friends. - Hey, don't put me in trouble. - Help him... Sir, she is a dangerous girl. Sir, gift isn't important for girls, giving is important. Did you see her observation? Okay. Hey, what's this? Gift isn't important, giving is important. Eat. - Greetings, sir. - Don't reveal our identity. - Where is he? - In 3rd floor. Coffee shop. Place is not satisfactory. Ask Pavan. Shall we kill him on the terrace? No. It's risky. It's not safe too. Let's have it in the parking area. Don't want. No problem, you come down. If he enters from left side corridor, he can't escape... We can lock him up all sides. Be careful. You take care of left. You, centre. You take care of entrance. You go at the backyard. - We shouldn't miss him. - Be confident. We will have him today. Let's fire at him immediately. Didn't he play with us? Let's play with him and then fire him. Just a minute... hello, out... Don't come this side... - Hello. - Sir, I'm Pavan here. We have cornered Sekar. We are in position. I just wanted your permission to kill him. No need, kill him. Kill him! Be careful. Best of luck. I'll call you after 10 minutes. Okay sir. Boys, come on... position. - It's very big... - Excuse me sir. You are wanted in upstairs. - Who called me? - Mr. Sami. I'll be back in a minute. Dear, wait... don't go there... What happened? - Task over? - Yes. Spot out? If I leave they will die. Send an ambulance and pick up the injured. Kids! They may die instantly. Hey, who are you, man? Bheema. Shit! Boys... Please lie down... How are you? It's just a first attempt, isn't it? No problem. Soon they will be back on feet. We have lot to do. Sir, I think it will take time for them to recover. Shall we form a new team? No need. They're the right men to do it. Have you seen the marks on their faces? They will pay him back. They have pride. They feel ashamed to face us. From now they will act differently. They will not miss the next chance. Where? Upstairs, 2nd floor. - Sekar... - Yes Chinna... Once I and Somu worked for Old man. He wants to talk to me personally. I'm don't trust him. You wait here for 10 minutes. - If I don't return, come up. - Okay. Shafi, be with him. He is coming. I'll give you good news. I'll take care of him. Call me after finishing the job. Hey, it's enough. Come... Where were you, man? I would've died. You seem to be very happy. Hey, don't sprinkle on me. Hey, don't waste the beer. Do you know Sekar didn't perform well? 4 men... Single handedly... I shot dead all, do you know? Boss has given me a treat and a girl. I blew one by one. Are you in love? Now look at his face... Hey Sekar, are you going to see your girl? - Hey, why are you irritating him? - Shut up! What's he? Shit! Where were you? I would've died. Chinna, land documents of those 3 guys. They are planning to sell after the eldest son returns from Dubai. Chinna, these are original documents. Only because of this, they are creating problems. Forget it. I'll deal it. Sekar, where were you last night? Chinna, I want to talk to you personally. What? - Chinna, I committed a mistake. - Shit! It's nothing. - In a fit of rage. - No, Chinna. It was my mistake. This is how I'm going to react in future too. I'm confused, Chinna. I'm preoccupied with something else. I don't how to explain it to you... But, I like it... I can't stay here in this frame of mind. I'll take leave from here, Chinna. Go... Just a minute. Let me not know your address. I may try to call you. What happened, Chinna? I don't know. Suddenly, he comes and said he wants to leave. I also didn't stop him. Something was in his mind... His decision won't go wrong. Let him go. Hi... How come you are here? I was in my own world. You came and spoilt it. Are you happy now? It's all because of you. - What have I done? - What you haven't done? I never missed my aim. Always hitting the bullseye. This is what I am! Now everything is past. Look at my face. I've decided to bear this torture for my entire life. I've left everything. I'm planning to get out of here. When? Today... right now... Today? Can we go tomorrow? Father, get up... Sit... I always used to stop you, isn't it? Now I'm telling you. It seems Sekar is shifting from here. If we kill him now, we can easily finish off the gang. All of them must die. I want to see their blood flowing. I must hear the bullets piercing their bodies. Didn't they laugh at us? I must have the last laugh. Hubby... What happened? I don't know why? Sekar came to me. And said I want to leave everything and go. I didn't feel like asking why... I just agreed to him. That day, if you had come with me when I asked you, My lifestyle would've been different. Okay. It has happened to him. Let him be happy. I would like to see Sekar now. Sekar, have you planned to go away without showing her to me? Won't you show your girl to us? Chinna. How can he remain here after seeing such a beautiful girl? Padma. Chinna, what's it? Hey, how can you escape without getting married? I wished for this only. Marry her. Come on... What's all this? Chinna, I'm Sami here. Old man's men entered our area and started killing our men. They hacked Bharathi's hand. Chinna, they are trying to capture our market. I'm really confused, Chinna. They've killed Velu. They've fired our harbour office. They are attacking us, Chinna. They planned it well and cornered us. - Sami, call me after some time. - Okay. I'm with Sekar. Do remember us. - Sekar... - Chinna. Be happy. Take care. - Hello. - Sami, I'm Sekar speaking. What's going on there? That is... Sami, I read Chinna's eyes... Don't hide anything from me. I know him from my childhood. I know... That is, Sekar... What's going on there? As I promised you, I'll be here tomorrow morning. You go... That's like Sekar. It's him only. Shoot him... Shoot... Shoot... Come on, shoot him... Go man... now dare to touch him... Come on, touch him... Come on. Grandma, give it to me... I'm doing it, isn't it? You mind your work. It's okay. I'll do it. You go. Why suddenly this change? Helping me? You can manage your In-laws. What is it? There is something. Go away, old man. Chinna gave you a life. I don't want to kill you. Go & live. How dare you! Why did he come back? He wished to leave and he must have left. He has finished everything in one day. I'm used to calling his name and now I see him everywhere. Did I ask him? Did I ask him to get me married? Did I ask him to take me to the top? He took me to the top and suddenly... It really hurts. When Sekar was around, none dared facing us. Once he left us, everyone wants to take a chance. It's your mistake. You sent him away the moment he made a request. He wanted to leave. To him, is anyone else more important than you? Call him & he will be back. We all are here. Where else will he go? - How can I call him? - You do nothing. Just stand there. Our boys will do the rest. I didn't sleep all night. I was thinking about you. Just because you're leaving the house, don't forget us. Do remember us. - What are you saying, Suji? - Just kidding. You forgot this. Imagine that you're going out for studies. Don't worry about our father. All fathers are the same. I'm here & I'll take care. You can go. Go I say. I'll cry a little. Bear it with me. O my love! You're born for me... O my dear! You're entered my life like God... Like hitting the highway, I'm stepping into your life... Our lives will be filled with the fragrance of love... O my love! You're born for me... O my dear! You're entered my life like God... Our lives will have no nights... I saw dawn in your eyes... We have no separation... Your blabbering is music to me... Until I met you, my life was like white paper... You made a painting with your eyes... I see millions of rainbows in your looks & words... O my love! You're born for me... O my dear! You're entered my life like God... Like hitting the highway, I'm stepping into your life... Our lives will be filled with the fragrance of love... Shafiq. Go. Sekar, come. Chinna's calling you. Is it? You left suddenly. He was talking about you all night. I couldn't see his face. We feel very bad. Come, let's go. I informed Chinna. He knows everything. What did you say? He's standing down. He asked me to bring you. Come. Has he come? I think you were about to leave the city. Come. What are you thinking about? Do you know he never stood before anyone like this? Don't be stupid. Now I am not alone. She has come with me, trusting me. I can't leave her just like that. I've informed Chinna. He knows everything. You leave. I knew this long back. That's why I never went after girls. Things went wrong on the other day too. Shall I inform him that you're giving it a thought? Don't be stupid. Leave. Go. I will come down. So, you are not coming? Falling in love... Shalu... Look here. Hey Shalu... Why did you do this? She is the reason why you're not coming. Now that she is dead, come with us. Hey Shafiq... Stop Chinna. Why did you come with me? Why Chinna? What's her fault? Sekar... Kill me. Why spare me? You took us to great heights. We all owe you. Kill me. Won't you think for a second? Look, why he shot. Look. Look there. Oh no! He disagreed. But we forced him to come here. He wanted you. He wants to be with you. He wished to be with you. Everything is gone. Oh no! Chinna. Do not fire. Shoot me. Shoot me. Wait. Shoot me. Shoot. Shoot me. I told you not to fire. It's an empty gun. No bullets. In order to gun him down, he pointed the gun at us. Who shot him first? Call the ambulance. No. Shoot. You're my first hero. You're the first real man I saw. You first gave me the log. Only our voice will echo here. There is no one to question us. I'm a bad man. But he is worse than me. He will shoot you in a blink. First time I got wet in rain... First time the closed windows opened for me... An unknown bird called me... My heart responded with flying... My heart floated gently... First time we got wet in rain... First time the closed windows opened for us... An unknown bird called us... Our hearts responded with flying... Our hearts floated gently...
