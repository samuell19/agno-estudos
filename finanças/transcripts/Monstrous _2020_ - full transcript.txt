This place is really out there, isn't it? Yeah, tell me about it. This is the turn coming up. Yeah, this is the straight, and then the house is just a half mile up on the left. Thank God. What the hell was that? Haley, let's just go. Haley, Haley. There's something else out there... Hey, Haley, seriously, let's go. Seriously, Haley, let's go. Haley, get in the car. Haley, get in the car, get in the car. Shoot. Oh, my God. - Is anyone out there? - Hello? - Hello? - Haley! - Haley! - Haley! - Hello? - Haley! Haley! Hello? Hello? Haley! - Is anybody out there? - Hello? Haley. - Hello? - Haley! Haley! With sightings all the way back to the 1970s by locals and before that by the Iroquois and Algonquin nations, Sasquatch, wow, look at that, very scary, has been named the official animal of the village of Whitehall. The legend of bigfoot has been around for quite some time and obviously there are lots of mythical monsters that people claim to have seen; Loch Ness and things like that, but there's something about bigfoot that really endures, and this town in particular, Whitehall in New York. Whitehall, New York has been a hotbed of bigfoot sightings over the last several years, several decades even. Now, whether there's any truth to them, hell, I don't know. Deer there, somethin' spooked 'em. Who knows what. Could've been us or it could've been the bigfoot. That's what we're out here for. Up here, Whitehall, New York, the Adirondacks. I found some classic bigfoot prints, but next to them, some small, similar prints. Which suggests that bigfoot may have had an offspring. Oh, I believe that bigfoot exists. The sightings are very credible. They don't seem very fake. These are people who didn't want to see this thing. In particular, the stories from Whitehall are fascinating. I can't keep away. This one was kind of a big blast of foot prints, but in the past they would kinda turn up here or there. In addition to finding the new tracks, I put this together with reports of several young women having gone missing from Whitehall in the last few months. I've seen his prints up here. I know he's out there. Sir, are you at all concerned for your safety? I'd like to say, I'm not, but you don't know what's out there. Hey, Jamie. Syl, are you still coming by later? Yeah, I'm just finishing up with the last dog right now. All right, I think I found something, okay? So, hurry up, I'll see you in a bit. All right, see ya later. Lilo. Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hi. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. Okay. What? Come on, Lilo. Oh, yeah. Christ. - You want in on this? - Nah, I'm good. You sure? Yeah, I'm not hungry. It's Taco Loco, come on. It's my treat. Didn't that place get like a C rating? Better than a D,. All right, what are the veggie options? Yeah, what are your vegetarian options? Hm. Oh, wait, can you get my mom a chicken quesadilla? And a chicken quesadilla. Oh yeah, oh yeah, that'll be good. That's all, thank you. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, my God, how many times have you watched that thing? - Hm, hm. - Yeah? We need all the facts that we get. Did you watch the documentary I sent you? - No. - Hm. Tomorrow, I promise I'll do it. I just, can we just chill tonight? I need you to listen very closely. - Here we go. - Oh, yeah. March 14th, 2015, a firsthand sighting. Susan Klein's disappearance, March 15th, coincidence? July 7th, 2018, firsthand sighting, photographic evidence, and also, a local noise complaint. July 12th, Molly Jenkins disappeared. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All in the very woods the sightings occurred. All vanished. It's the Squatch. I said we're not calling it that. You know, it's weird because never before was there a reason to believe that it was aggressive. Sasquatch keeps to himself in the woods like a goddamn ghost. I mean, that's why no one can get a good fuckin' picture of 'em. Something pissed it off. No, Jamie, come on. Come on, there's no bigfoot, there's no Squatch. What, yeah, I know, I know, I agree there's something weird going on. I think we should just focus on that. Which brings me to my next point. Come, take a look at this. You remember that guy named Alex? The mystery man who paid Dana to take him to the Adirondacks before she went missing. Well, guess who posted another ad? You're meeting up with Alex? More like we are. No. - Hear me out... - No, Jesus. You wanna meet up with a potential serial killer and go on a road trip with him? What the fuck - is wrong with you... - No, no, listen to me. You won't ever have to be near him, okay? He thinks that I'm a girl, but I'm gonna surprise him, and then he'll have to let me drive him to his place or it's gonna be weird. All I need you to do is be my backup. I just need you to drive behind me in case something happens. Dana might still be alive. We're not gonna have another chance like this. I need to know what happened. Or I need to figure it out. She deserves that much. Taco Loco. Hey, mom. Yeah, no, this morning. I was just calling to see if you were gonna be back for dinner. I was calling to see if you were gonna be back for dinner, I got you a quesa... Bye, mom. Shit. Sylvia, the plan's off. What? I said the plan's off. Are you okay? Taco Loco got me again. Are you kidding me? You were right, okay? You planned this whole elaborate thing out, you guilt trip me into coming, and then you bail on me? Sylvia, everything is leaving my body from everywhere right now. Just please try and understand. What did you say Alex looks like? I don't know. He said, tall, dark hair, and a denim jacket I think. I think Alex is a girl. What? You're sure this is the same ad? You know that I am. I'll do it. No. No, Sylvia, this, it was okay when you were gonna be my backup, but neither of us should be doing this alone. - I'm gonna do it. - No, it is a bad idea. Look, she already thinks I'm a girl, right? I'll just play along. Bye. Just remember if things get, if things get like out of, hold on. I'm gonna go, Jamie. I'll talk to you later, feel better. Alex? Hey, yeah, um, Jamie? Yeah. - We said 50 each way, right? - Mm hm. - Thanks. - Mm hm. Sorry. So, you always do this? What? Road trips with strangers. Oh, first time. Well, I appreciate it. Sure. So, why the big rush to get to the Adirondacks? A wedding. Congratulations. Oh, I'm the photographer. But you're actually saving me. My ride bailed last minute and I need to get there before Monday. So, thanks. Oh, yeah, it should take like a day and a half, I think. Yeah. You're still okay sharing a room, right? I mean, if I could afford to I would, but. No, it's, it's fine. - Great. - Great. Great. I gotta say, I'm relieved you're so cool. I wasn't sure what to expect. Trust me, I'm not that cool. Someone checking in on you? No. Boyfriend? It's not really what I go for. Yeah, me neither. Yeah, I thought so. Um, excuse me, you assumed my sexuality? - Not cool. - Well, well, uh, just a guess. Don't post something mean about me online. Fine, but only because you're so private on Facebook. What? I looked you up when you answered my ad, and honestly, I was a little nervous you were the dude, but I figured I could just bail if things got creepy. You know, it's weird we didn't run into each other at all. It's not exactly a big town. Yeah. You know, I was only there a week. Didn't really see anything worth checking out. Yeah, it's a shame we didn't meet earlier. We should get going. - You. - I, it's fine. Wine? So, how deep in the woods are you? Should I know how to fight a bear or? No, the house is great. Um, but, honestly, it's kind of isolated. So, yeah, study up. Wait, seriously? No, no, no, no, it's fine. There have actually been some disappearances lately, but, I mean, as long as you stay out of the woods, and you should be good. Do you think someone killed them? No, I think it's more like people got lost, but you never know what's out there, so. People are weird. You're right about that. So, what makes you weird? Probably a lot of things. What uh, what makes you weird? You don't wanna know. I'm gonna go wash my face. Okay. Jamie? Sorry. What are you doing? I'm so, I must've been sleep walking. I'm sorry. It's so embarrassing. I thought, I didn't know I was gonna start again. It's okay, you just scared me. Sorry. Hello? Jamie? No, no, I can't hear you. You're breaking up... Reception's a bitch out here. Yeah, I'm getting that. The GPS doesn't work anymore, but we're close enough. I know the way. How long have you been sleep walking? I don't know, 12, I guess? Hm, that's pretty old to start. - Maybe I was 10. - 10. 12 or 10? Why does it matter? Well, I just think it's pretty weird not to know unless you're lying. I think we should slow down. I said, are you a liar? We're going too fast! So, you think this is fast? Stop it! What the fuck is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? I'm not the one snooping through your shit. I told you, I was sleep walking. You steal in your sleep, too? Why do you have it? I hunt. Where I'm from, everyone has one. What are you doing? Don't like when strangers touch your things? Stop it! Why, you have something to hide? Okay, okay, I lied. Why? I knew about the disappearances. What? Look, you weren't online anywhere. I just wanted to make sure you were who you said you were. Listen, Jamie, I think I should just get another ride from here. You can keep the money, I'm just getting a little weird for me. No. What do you want from me? Want a drink? Sure. It's cool, right? I'm vegetarian. We're not gonna eat it. What's that noise? Oh, it's this frequency system. The ringing will go away soon. The deer hate it. Jesus Christ. Syl, pick up your phone, okay? Um, I'm worried. I don't know if you're getting my messages, if you're dead, alive, who knows? Hi, Syl, yeah, I thought maybe 20th time would be the charmer. Apparently not. I don't know if you're getting any of messages, or perhaps you're dead. So, if you get a chance, maybe just give me a call back. If not, I'll see you around 10:30 when I arrive there tonight. Anyway, I miss you. Bye. Where is this place? Fuck! Thanks. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. What? Stay there. No, I'm embarrassed. Come on, you're fine. Just relax. You really aren't bothered by any of the disappearances? Are you seriously bringing that up right now? They just, they all happened so close to here. I mean, yeah, I don't like it, obviously. But I don't know, I just, I don't think about it. Why are you so obsessed with it? My name's not Jamie. What? It's Sylvia. Why do you keep lying to me? I had this friend, Dana, best friend, actually. She's one of the women who disappeared. I had this insane idea that if I came here I could find out what happened to her. She had answered an ad online asking for a driver to take her here. The same recent one that I responded to, yours. You think I killed her? Wasn't sure. And now? Look, I told the cops, she drove me here and she left, and I thought that was the end of it. Okay. I don't like liars. I'm sorry. Hello, yeah? An enforcement action executed by the U.S. Treasury. - Ah, fuck you! - Requesting... - Come on. - Your serious attention. Ignoring this will be an intentional second... You gotta be fucking kidding me. Come on, come on. Just give me one bar, just one. Just one bar, just give me one bar. Oh, shit. I let my sister die. What? I was in high school and I tried one of my mom's cigarettes in her room. Lit some candles to try to cover it up, and I accidentally left one on. There was a fire. It was my fault. I tried to get to her, I just couldn't. All that smoke, I just couldn't. My mom, who was a nurse, didn't come visit me in the hospital at all. I know she blames me. She's right. I killed her. You aren't a monster. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Tell me. Sometimes I think I hate myself. No, I look horrible. You're beautiful. Where are my clothes? Syl, pick up your phone. Yeah, I'm gonna be there by 10:30 tonight. So, maybe I'll see you there. Or you can just give me a call back if you're not dead already. Fuck. What? What the fuck? Fuck! Oh, shit. What's going on? There's something out there. You knew about it. We're safe in here. How? That ringing you heard earlier, it's an electromagnetic frequency system that thing can't stand. The markers in the driveway. It's really meant for deer, but that thing hates it. So, as long as it's on we're safe. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. - What's wrong? - Nothing. You're safe with me. You trust me? Let's go get a drink. We're not gonna sleep tonight. You're quiet. Sorry. Sylvia, I've been living here for years. As long as you're with me, you're safe. Did you make it to your car? No. I didn't wanna leave you. Well, I wouldn't blame you if you did. Sure. Seriously though, why'd you come back? I didn't wanna ditch you. You know, I used to have this old fat beagle named Banjo. My dad and I used to take him hunting and he'd run ahead howling, pointing at squirrels. Once a year we'd have a competition to see who could score a deer first. We'd all split up and Banjo would always follow me. Every year I'd lose because Banjo was always right there howling, scaring everything away. When I was 16, though, I had this perfect shot. A giant buck with huge antlers, lined up right in front of me about 200 feet away. Didn't even know I was there, but out of the corner of my eye I see old Banjo and he gets this look on his face and I know that he's about to howl. So, I shot him and then I shot the deer, and then I won. You shot your dog? I won. Okay, listen. Listen. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine now. Wait. Wait. It's okay. What is that? Sylvia? I will be right back. No, no, no, no, no. - No. - I won't leave you. - Okay. - I know what I have to do. Okay? I won't leave you. What's going on? I thought I heard a noise. I told you you're safe in here and you keep wandering off. I know, I'm sorry. Well, now I'm up again, so. So, tell me about your sister. What? Your sister, what was she like? I don't talk about her. Why not? It still bothers you that much. Must've been a really interesting kid. Don't talk about her. Just curious. Are you happy you figured it out? What? What happened to Dana. It's what you came for, right? Didn't really make me feel any better. No? The closure didn't help? Not like I thought it would. I'm sorry. I'm not really in the mood. Right. You know, whenever this all ends, I'll be sad to see you go. You're not like other girls, you're, there's just something heavy about you. Anger. I just feel like I can relate to you, and that doesn't happen often. I can't stand most people. I'm not angry. Well, come on. "Sometimes I think I hate myself," remember? Your words. Where are you going? I'm going to the basement, I need to grab something. What? What's the problem? Let's go upstairs. Okay. So, I guess you aren't making it to that wedding, huh? Yeah. Must be hard to find work out here. Yeah, I guess. Why? Just because of the no service. Hey, what would you have done if you were right? What? If I was the one killing all those girls, what would you have done? I don't know. It was stupid. Well, you would've done something. Come here. You are so beautiful. Do you think I'm a fucking idiot? I knew it. I'm guessing you saw my photo lab? Shut up. Look at you, big, big Sylvia. I said, shut up! There's the rage. Stay, you fuckin'... No, without power, we're fucked. I need to get downstairs. No, you're not moving a fucking inch... Sylvia, you have no idea what this thing is capable of. I'm not letting you go. You haven't seen what I've seen. It will make you wish you were dead. I have to get to the basement. Shut it. What did you do to my car? What's the rush? I saw her. I saw all of them. And? You're not like them. Who are... Sylvia? Jamie. Oh, my God. - Dude, where were you? - I have no idea. I saw it, I saw it. The last thing I remember is Squatch beating the shit outta me, waking up in dirt, and then I, I, I, I get up and I'm wandering around looking for you and. It's gonna kill us. I think if it wanted to kill us, we'd be dead. You need to set it. What? My arm, it's dislocated. Fuck no. You need a hospital. - Jamie, come on. - No, I can't. It's a grave site. That's how they bury each other. You would know that if you watched that documentary I sent you. The fuck? Syl I, I don't get it. I don't know why it didn't kill us. You know, all those girls, but not us, I. It didn't kill Dana. What? But you. Alex? Fuck. You, you remember my birthday last year? Yeah. Dana, she was obsessed with hanging those stupid twinkling lights for it. Oh, please, you still have 'em up. Because she hung 'em really high. And then I had to show her that stupid fuckin' post the next day. You know, I knew she was gonna go, all alone. It wasn't your fault. Yeah. You need to set it. - I can't. - Yes, you can. Dammit. Talk me through it. Come here. - Sit down. - Okay. - Most important thing. - Yeah. 45 degrees, you gotta pull it, - put it back into place. - I hate math problems. - You ready? - No. But do it. Okay. - One, two... - Don't fuckin' count. Okay. God, fuck. - Oh, my... - That was the worst. Yeah, it wasn't good for me either. Put it down. I said, put it down! I'm sorry. I have to go back. Where? To the house? No, yeah, well what about the fuckin' police? - She has another girl. - Shit. Can you get to your car? Yeah, probably. Okay. Pick me up at the house. No, no, I don't want you going alone. You can barely walk. We don't know how much time we have before she kills her... Hey, what's your plan? She has some kind of frequency system that keeps that thing away. Like a deer repellent? Yeah, something about the sound, it can't stand it. Look, if I can get to the basement I can shut the power off. Alex will have no where to hide. I can grab Molly, I can get her outta there. She has videos. Dana? You sure? This can't happen again. I couldn't live myself. I don't think you could either. Be careful, yeah? Ah, fuck. Yeah. Fuck me. Fuck me. Don't, no, no. You know what? This might make everything you did to me actually worth it. For this moment. Don't. Why? Why not? Ooh, boy. Welcome back. Sit down, I'm making tea. You know, you're the only one to ever suspect me. Part of me didn't even wanna kill you. I mean, we had fun. Could even have more time. It was a lot less complicated before. I guess I pissed it off. But it doesn't matter anyway. It all would've ended the same. We are what this fucked up world made us to be, and you're only here because you let someone else die, right? But you're here. Ow. Go ahead, you're already a murderer, right? No! Stop! No, no. Hey, Syl. Syl? Hey. You're alive. I can't believe we saw the Squatch.
