Sir, fix it right there. Sir, slightly towards left. Sir, clear shot. Sir, its perfect! Hold it right there Sir, there are four men. Sir, perfect. Hold it. Sir, zoom in. Sir, one of them is on the phone. Clothes from laundry. It was me. I was knocking for long. Here. - How much? - Fifty bucks. - Here. - Ok. Check if there is any new message. - Mr. Akhilan, any idea why I summoned you? - Sir? - Sir, I know why. - What do you know? The secretriat has passed a government order. A plan to upgrade the police department by introducing a system known as the Combined Emergency Service. And as a part of this, two police officers are selected from every state in India and... are sent to America to get trained. And to represent Tamizh Nadu you have recommended Akhilan sir and myself. How did you know all this? I was tracking a VIP's number in regards to a case and during that time... and by mistake tracked your number. And so I heard your conversation. You mean you evasedropped on mine and Secratary's conversation. Sir, isn't that my job profile? Very good. Mr. Akhilan, you can get the remaining details too from Bhaskar. - Ok? - Sure sir. Thank you sir. We are just waiting for the documents from the government. The proceedings have been taken care of. - All the best. - Thank you sir. No one has ever handed me such a big responsibility! Listen Bhaskar, don't be mischievous like you are back home. Better behave yourself. This is America. We must be little careful. Now that you have warned me, you will see a new Bhaskar. Hello Mr. Akhilan Vishwanath. Welcome to Las Vegas. - How are you, sir? - Beautiful. - Mr. Bhaskar, how was your trip? - Hi. - Everything good? - All good. Great. Let's go and freshen up before we start. Welcome to the 911 call center. Back in India we rely on God when we face a situation. But here in America, people call 911 when they face a problem. Talk about Gods and 911 is God here. Come on, lets meet the officer. Come with me. - Hi Swetha. - Hello Mr. Balachander, how are you? - Are you a Malayalee? - Yes. - Where in Kerala? - Kozhikode. Oh! Kolly code? Not Kolly code! Its Kozhikode! Kozhikode! Guess, I stretched it a bit. Well, things aren't working as I'm expecting them to. Stop expecting unnecessary things. Lets mind our own business. Hope the training schedule is ready. - This is the heart of Vegas. Please come. - Like T. Nagar is to Chennai? Isha... Hey Isha! What happened? Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. Mr. Akhilan... she is Isha Thomas. A very talented officer. She will brief you both on the services of 911. This is the map of Las Vegas. One is green point and one is red point. Red points are where lot of crimes take place. Similar to areas like Vysarpadi, Royapuram and Puliyanthope in Chennai. Whoa! Our boys are so famous that they get mentioned while police training in America! I feel so proud. Excuse me! I just compared the localities. Not the crimes. Even if compared, the crime rate here is just 5%. Ok? You talk like its the volume of alcohol in liquor! Instead of taking a class on controlling crimes... why don't you come up with ideas to prevent crimes from happening? - Bhaskar! - Fine, I'm sure you have a good point to think otherwise. Be quiet and listen to the class. I might nod off if I'm don't interact. You take the call on what I should do. It can be done, Mr. Bhaskar. And for that there must be a change in your country's political infrastructure, first. Ma'am, so you were teaching us about red points and green points. Please continue. Our 911 controller will be monitoring the red points areas round the clock in the CCTV. And if they sense any crime is about to happen, then with help of speakers fixed there... we will alert the corresponding people. And the patrol police nearby will act upon handling the crime. In short, the severe the punishment... lesser the crimes. So tell me, what's that huge blank space? This is Nelson's landy. No citizens and so blank. Now it is a ghost town. This area was banned 22 years ago. There is no other history for this. Emergency, non emergency and violence calls... and sometimes even we operators are not sure on how to go about it. And sometimes it can affect the operators mentally. We have a 24 hours psychiatrist service available here. Well, even trainees like you might require it sometimes. I won't require it. May be, now that he has met you, he might need it. You go over there and learn how to attend calls. Then I'll tell you what's next. Isha... I would like to talk to you in person. Duh! She thinks marriage and chess are the same! Culture, I say! Isha! For the past couple of days I haven't seen Isha at office. I'm not sure what happened but she was upset and put down her resignation letter. Resignation letter? Yes but I haven't forwarded it to the higher officials. She is a brilliant girl. But I'm not sure if she will ever return. Excuse me. Sir, why are you so concerned about that girl? Well Bhaskar... what if she had resigned because I'm here? Sir, how did I miss it? What games did you play to drive her away? Bhaskar! - Sir, all I meant was did you make her fall for you. - Idiot. Which company? Softono Technologies. It's an I.T company, sir. You, turn on the lights. Sir. Ok, you may leave. What are you looking at? Go, mind your business. Help! What happened? - My sister... - Relax. Calm down and tell me what happened. - My sister... - Your sister? Kindly calm down and tell me what happened. My sister... Hello, tell me dear. Dear sister....Dear sister... Jenny! What happened? I don't know who but someone's knocking the door vigorously. On top of that there's power outrage here. I am scared! Please come home as soon as possible. Stop the car! - This is my house. - Ok. Stop the car. Which floor? First floor. Who's idea was this? It was mine. Sorry sir. We disturbed you unnecessarily. She is very mischievous. She keeps playing pranks all the time. Its ok. Please carry on. Come on. Happy birthday dear sister. Isha, only the two of you live here? What about your parents? Anyway, you guys can have my number in case of any help or emergency. Please note it down. - Noted? - Ok. Just a minute. - Drive faster. - What happened? - Careful. Drive faster. - Who's that? He is a friend of my sister's. He noticed us. Drive faster! Faster! We have caught his attention. Hey! Watchout! Your Duppatta (shawl) is about to get stuck on the wheel! The police is not at fault here for you to confront us. They met with an accident because the girl's Duppatta got stuck on the wheel. This is the truth. But the public says that it was you. Please don't point fingers at us based on baseless accusation. We know what's the truth. We shall face what comes. Thank you. Isha? How rude that you kill my sister and then act innocent, claiming not to have done it! You just showed the true color of police. Isha, its not like what you are imagining. We are not at fault. - Please understand. - Please, don't call me hereafter. I went to Isha's home to explain her that I wasn't the reason for her sister's death. Isha, give me a chance! Isha! Isha, please hear me out. She left to her native. No one's there at home. Any idea where she went? She said she was going to her native. Well Akhilan, I am the one who must apologize. I must have heard you out. I hated you thinking that you were the reason for Jenny's death. But after sometime when I found out the truth... I didn't have the courage to face you. But... - now, I myself... - No Isha! Its not your fault. I am happy that you realized I'm not the reason for your sister's death. But you are doing th same mistake. Isha, you can save many others like Jenifer out there. Please re-think. You must return. Not only to your job... but in my life too. Aki...

Don't you say a word about this back home. Come on. Don't be embarrassed. Stun gun is a gun that electrocutes. So who pays for the electricity? Sir, he is insulting India too much. This operation is an excellent opportunity to put him in his place. We must show him what Indian police are capable of. You shut up! Wait and watch me unleash hell on you. Well, you are gonna witness it soon. Sir, I have learnt Karate... and I own all colors of Karate belt. Do you think I should show it to him? Keep quiet. We have seen worse in our place. We have faced tougher issues in our place. - We can handle it. - Bhaskar, this is something else. No! No! I will take care boss. Sir, just ask him to keep his eyes on the road while driving. I'll take care of this. You see man! I can see the duck! Where is the enemy? Bhaskar, we are here for these ducks. You! I have never cared for anyone since my childhood! And you want me to care for these ducks? Forget about me. Do you have any idea about the criminals he has nabbed in his career? And you want him to do this job? Not under the car! Catch! Hey! What happened? Why are you crying, Mathangi? - Don't cry. - Did you invite us here to see you cry? Don't cry. What happened? Tell us, what happened? Our motherland that we had lost for long; well, my brother and I are going back there. We are heading to our country. My mom is still alive and living there. Mathangi! What do you mean? Just like my mom, I'm sure that your folks too would have found a piece of land to live over there. I'll go back and search for them and find them out. Then what are you waiting for? Carry on with the proceedings. All the formalities are done. I'll be leaving within this week. I wanted to bid goodbye and that is why I asked you all to meet me. Really happy to hear this. Give our regards to your mom. Sure. All the best. Let's leave. You guys leave. I have some shopping to do. Uh-oh, she forget her phone in a hurry. Give to me. I'll give it to her on my way back. You can do it! The SIM can be traced if it gets in to its Mother tower radius. I'll follow that. Mathangi Kumaravel. - Are you a Tamizhian? - Yes. Can you save me? Our best team is out to save you. Meanwhile, don't panic and you must help me to help you. Ok. From where did you get kidnapped? Passion plaza. And how? I was knocked unconscious with chloroform. Have you seen the kidnapper anywhere before? I don't know. I didn't his face at all. When did it happen? May be around... "2:30" Using what did they kidnap you? A car. - Color? - Black. Your kidnapper has be identified. In sometime our team will rescue you. What happened Isha? The car in which you are, has been blocked. No way! The car in which I am, is still moving. So, won't you be able to rescue me? Mathangi, are you sure you were kidnapped from Passion plaza? Yes! I am very sure. 2:30 pm from Passion plaza. Sir, what's happening? I thought we would catch him. Isha... please check, if there is some other black color car that left the parking lot after 2:30 pm. Why can't it be a similar car like the first one? We followed the first car... and coincidentally it was been stolen by someone else. But the car that was used to kidnap the girl... may be it can be the second car, which left the parking lot after 2:30. Now what? Is this car also a stolen one? No idea. He could have changed the number plate too. Don't cry, Mathangi. We just can't live peacefully. Why do you say so? You have fought all you life and this situation is nothing compared to all that. What do I do now? If you co operate with me, both of us can work this out together. Ok? Let's do it. - Do you see the tail lamp? - Yes. Break the tail light. I am unable to break it. Please check, you may find something using which you can break it. What happened? I broke open it. Look through it and tell me what all do you see? This doesn't look like a city. What else do you see? It looks like a highway. Highways? Check if you can see any landmarks, spell board, road names or anything. I don't see anything. It's a plain land. No, I can't notice anything. Why? What's happened? It is raining heavily here. It appears to be a highway. Its Boulder city highways. It has rained here but I don't see any trace. Mathangi, at any time did you feel the car taking a turn? What are you doing, Mathangi? I'm shouting out for help. You might just put your life in risk. Whatever you do; you must do it without kidnapper's knowledge. Tell me, is there anything else in the car? - There are two boxes. - Ok. Open them. Why are you crying? He is going to kill me for sure. Please. Don't cry, Mathangi. Isn't there a way to rescue me? Don't you think so. Our team is very close by where you are. If you want, I shall connect them to you. The officer will talk to you. Please. Do something. That's right baby! Mathangi is scared. I think it would be helpful if you talk to her. We are right behind you. We will reach you anytime. It's time you stop being scared, Mathangi! We are all with you. - Just do as I say. - Tell me. - You said there were two boxes right? - Yes. What's the other box? Its a gift box. Open that box. - Opened it. - What's in it? It contains just a toy car. Do you see anything else around? Right next to the box there's chart paper and pen. Ok Mathangi, is that toy car a remote operated kinda toy? Yes. Ok, do one thing. Write 911 on that chart paper... attach it to the toy car and throw the toy car outside through the tail lamp hole. Got it? Mathangi, ensure that the toy car never goes out of your control. Try controlling the toy car! Any calls yet Isha? No Aki. No calls yet. Mathangi, if people must notice us then we must grab their attention. Got it? What happened? A car's approaching. Good! Disturb that car. Use the remote! Come on! Do it fast! Do something! Fast! What happened? Don't you know how a prepaid SIM works? I think we should wait for mother tower. I see another car approaching. Disturb that car too. Position the car and disturb it. Use the remote. Try disturbing and getting the attention of the car that you see now, Mathangi. Mathangi, what happened? A man came forward to help me. He killed him and put his corpse right next to me in the trunk. Poor fellow... he died because of me. Silver color and its a luxury car. I saw him. Fair skinned and he was wearing a blue shirt. Check if there is any identification card on the man who came to save you. Come on, Mathangi. Check his pockets. Nope. There's nothing. So, that's it. Isn't it? It's all over. Isn't it? Isha... Mathangi... When you hear me speak in my mother tongue, it made you call me a fighter. I'm happy. I am not scared and worried that I might lose my life. We have seen and lost worse that this. All that I am worried is about my brother's future. Me, at least I have felt my mother's love. I lived with my mother for while that I can still feel her when I think of her. But its not the same with my brother. He was with her only till he grew inside her. Can you do me a favor, Isha? My brother must unite with my mother. No matter what happen to me... please don't reveal anything to my brother. Nothing is going to happen to you Mathangi. We are used to waiting for tomorrow. And we will soon get used to this too. He will live with the hope that someday I'll return. No Mathangi. Your dreams won't remain just dreams. We have traced your location. You are going on the Laughlin Needle highway. Great! Isha, inform me as soon as you have any information on the finger prints. All we need is his finger prints and all his details can be retrieved. Lucifer Fernando! Eyes on the finger prints! Stop ogling at the chick! Yeah! The coolers are off again! He thinks he is Tom Cruise! A9... George master colony, C Block. No matter what happens! Doesn't matter who is behind it! Injustice won't last for long! Who cares if it is a revenge or rage! Justice is all that will prevail in the end. I say that injustice will find its way to glory! I am the villain of the villains and I will rule the world! You better watch out! I'm the Danger, you don't want to mess with. God is nothing without the Satan! Listen to me you demon, you better calm down! I am the assassin who is here to put an end to you. Selfishness will always be the winner. It will rule the human race! Putting an end to you will not quench my thirst. There should never be another one like you. I am here on the behalf of lord of the death! Are you ordering him? Its password protected, sir. Sir, there is a video clip. Why would such a person kidnap a woman? Well, he could have kidnapped him instead. Crazy fellow! Quiet down, Bhaskar. Stop blabbing. He is already furious with us. I'm purifying my blood so that we can be together, Casey. Tell me, Isha. Akhil, I hope you must have received the details about Lucifer. After interrogation Lucifer's wife... she gave me a voice recording of Lucifer. The fishy thing about is that... he keeps repeating the same thing over and again. Moreover, every time he spoke to his wife... he has kidnapped a person a day before that. What do you mean, Isha? And all of them were killed in the same manner. And the shocking thing is that all of them have the same blood group. And Lucifer too has the same blood group. I'll send you the recording. Ok, fast! - Bhaskar. - Sir? Just listen to this. I can hear a peculiar sound in both, the video and the audio. See if you can connect the dots listening to that sound. Sir, come on. Sounds like he is talking from some rice mill. I just shared what I felt. Bhaskar, based on what Isha said... after his motive with the girls he kidnapped... he must have called his wife from the same place. Which is why the background sound is the same in both. Where could it be? Try listening to it again, sir. - Isha. - Tell me, Aki... I think we are getting closer to Lucifer. In that suicide video, at the 38th second, a logo can be seen on the roof. Can you confirm me what that logo is? Its Nelson's landy. Nelson's landy right? It is a gold mine and currently its not in use. Its been banned since 22 years. - What if Lucifer is using it to his advantage? - Correct. Sir, forget him. He is good for nothing. He is on a ego trip! And that's because you are the one finding all the clues. Sir, you go do what is necessary to find Mathangi. I'll handle this robot! Just go. Come again. What did you say? A police doesn't wait for the criminal to show up. A true policeman is one who finds, fights and nabs the criminal. Our uniforms might be different... but the police profession and its emotion are the same! Aki, if our assumption turns out to be correct, please inform me. I'll send you the force. Sure. How will you reach there? Listen to me, I am a the warrior. I'm going to uproot you alive. Listen you kid, I am a hunter. The whole world will realize how brainy and witty I am. I will fight face to face and triumph over you! No matter where you are, I'll trace you down! No one or nothing can near or conquer me. And if anyone nears me, they will never find their way back out. I'm the hunter that will shoot you down!
