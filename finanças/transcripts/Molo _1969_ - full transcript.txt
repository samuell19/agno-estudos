The Pier Starring Music Camera Story, directed by Do you think the weather will keep up? So far it's fine. - I'm tired... I'd like to drive home now. There're just two days left. - I brought you a shaver and some coffee. - What's the day today? Tuesday? Friday. - My god... Friday... Oh, I can take you home if you like. = No. I still have half an hour of free time. I'm gonna sit over here for a while. - I'm loosing you. Change the channel. - Ok now. - Change to channel 2. I can hear you now. Fine. - Attention, we're starting a test in 5 minutes. Hurry up, kids. - Mr. engineer, sir! - Please wait! - Hey, hey, it's not a bakery. No need to hurry. Be patient! - What are you doing here? Shitting in your pants already? Marta has called for the fourth time. I'm not gonna fix your personal problems for you. Hey, what's wrong with you? - Mr. Rally Driver? What's wrong with you? Pawel, are you afraid? - The locking frame is incomplete. They will not accept it. - They won't? Great, I'm very happy hearing that. Go on. - Let's make a mike check, shall we? - What mike check? - What will you talk about? Casual wear or suit and tie? Mom... Pawel, wait! - Mom, Andrzej is exhausted. But he will get back to you. I promise. = You should have checked it yesterday, not now! - Why repeating it all the time? - I wanna have a drink and go to bed. - And I wanna have two drinks and go to bed. You can sleep here. Go ahead! Just stick some putty in your ears. Lads, we've got a ship to launch over here. - What's this? - A microphone. - Marek, did you record that? Great! Thank you. - You're welcome. - Yeah? - Why don't you pick up the phone? You know, I think I'll stay here overnight. - Thay called you from the club. You're not crazy enough to come here and race? Call them and tell them that I'm crazy. - After working all night? - This is not Monte Carlo, Marta. We're going to rest afterwards. - Andrzej... - Yeah? Nothing. - We're going to our rancho. - Fine. - Shall I bring you some food? - No, thanks. I'll eat out. - Keep working then. - You bet. - Where's Staszek? We're starting filming! - I'm here. No need to shout. We're starting. - Tell me something about the ship. It's your ship, you built it, not me. Tell me something personal, ok? Fine, but why don't we do it afterwards, shall we? - Is it true that Poland launches the largest number of fishing boats in the world? True, I have read it myself in a newspaper. - Could you give us the names of your co-workers? - Pawel! - What's the impact of the launch on our foreign trade? - I believe it has some impact. Have you seen Pawel? - I heard that the engine is not ready? - Do you know a ship which sails without engine? - No. - I haven't neither. - You're extremely busy here, Andrzej, but this issue is extremely important for our readers. - And you believe in that? - Excuse me? - Do you think that readers are interested in displacement of our ship? Oh mr. engineer! Maybe you're overexcited, huh? - Why are you running here back and forth. Do you need some fresh air or something? - I'm sorry, I'm in trouble. I'm looking for Pawel and I cannot find him. - Please don't feel offended. Bye. - Sure, It's the easiest way to end the interview. - You've watched our transmission from Vietnam. We're starting a transmission of ship launching. We're getting through a shipyard now. - Camera one, why are you filming the guy with a trumpet?! Move on to Staszek, you moron! - On behalf of our shipbuilders I welcome you to the ship launching ceremony in Gdansk. - Our cameras are now in the docks of this huge industrial complex... ...which Is making ships of all flags, but mainly for constantly growing Polish flag. - I remember that day, 3rd of April 1948, when I was here not as a corespondent... ? but as a regular fan, watching a first keel being set under the collier called Soldek... ...& first ship built over here. - This event went down in history. But this page in history Is still being written... ...by Polish workers and engineers. - A new ship will be launched in a moment, a trawler B-22. - His constructor, an engineer, Andrzej Rudnicki has extreme jitters. - He must be feeling now like a father in spe, waiting at the door of a birth clinic. - Please keep your fingers crossed then and wish him good luck! Camera I, 2 and 3 - show me Rudnicki now! Camera 2, a close up please. Show our hero, guys! - I can't say much. I'm moved, that's all. - This is my first ship. Please excuse me the incoherence of my speech... ...we've been working a lot. We had to make it everything in order. This is a pretty big ship. I'd like to thank my crew for their devotion. Thank you. Please baptise the ship now! - Sail the world's oceans and seas, celebrate the Polish ship workers... ...and the honour of Polish flag. Therefore I'm naming you Liral You'll be more comfortable with the other hand. Release the mechanical breaks' stoppers! Unlock the mechanical breaks! Release the screws! Attention! Cut! Are you ready? Go! Stretch, 400. Left, 90. Right, 80. Stretch, 300. Right, left zero. Left, 70. Attention, right, 60! Right, 90. Attention, left 80! Right, left, 70. Left, bridge, 60. Stretch, 300. Give me a cigarette. Something wrong? Quite the contrary. I'm perfectly fine. - I just forgot where we were going... Are you in hurry? - No. - OK, then we can rest for a while. I recalled something completely different. I'll be 40 in two days... - As we all have gathered here, I'd like to say something. Each ship launching is unforgettable. - Each one Is a new excitment, Each one reflects the climate of our work, ...each one reflects the involvment of our crew. - In those short moment we experience with our crew the everyday trouble... ...which lead to accomplishment of the next task. - Please let me quote a poet here: "Brick to brick build a wall... ...the sweat shines like morning dew on the grass. The new day is coming... " "The ordinary day - iron and coarse... " - "Trees, flowers, rivers, the mountain breeze, birds and butterflies, grains of sand... " - "Pine needles, autumn fruits and the night shine of the moon, trembling asp leaves and fallen acorns. " - "Chestnuts, rusty leaves, houses, furniture, clocks, flagstones... " - "The consecutive numbers of decimal system. One, two... " So? - You're so young, that I don't now what can come to your mind. - You can invide me to your undoubtly lovely attic... .? With undoubtly delightful atmosphere. A quarter liter of vodka will await us there... ...and you will sing me an old, but good song: - "First the vodka, then your lips and then... ? - I'm not so ill-mannered. - One can call it "an inclination towards women. " I'd rather drink Bruderschaft with you. - I like meeting people like you. I feel much younger. Don't you agree? - So? - Beg you pardon? What's your name? - Ah, right. I'm Marek. - I'm Marta. - You don't have to be on confession. You can kiss me. This is what you were after, weren't you? - I'm sorry! I didn't want to distress you. - No. On the beginning I even thought it was very nice. - Maybe I haven't gone out with Andrzej for a long time. - So many people here... So many faces. I can't remember anyone. I'm sorry. - Excuse me, miss! Can you hear me? I'm terribly sorry! No problem. - Wil you have a drink with me? - I must have seen you somewhere before. But I don't remember where. - A barmaid buys everyone a cognac. You should drink it. - Congratulations for your magnificent ship launch, monsieur. - Where do you know me from? - I've seen you on TV. - It was a solemn event. I finish work in two hours. - Will you go for a walk with me to the beach? - I'm at the official banquet here. In my own honour so to speak. - My wife is also here. And it's her who I will take for a walk. What can I do for you then? Oh, nothing. Thanks. I think I made a mistake. I must have seen you somewhere before... Excuse me. Come meet my husband, kid. - You're working in the shipyard, right? - Bravo. - Why did you let me overtake you? - Ah, it's you. The great driver. - You were still better at the turn. I just had a better car. - You're Mr. Philantropist! - All you say is truth. Thank you. - What's your name? He's name is Kid. It's his surname. - We Introduced ourselves to each other. We had Bruderschaft. How do you like my wife, my friend? - Enough. There are strangers among us. Stand at the wall. There's a time for selection now. - The weak ones are free. The rest is to be shot. - I don't want to be shot. My grandpa died in the camp. - You've got all confused, my dear. Leave your grandpa alone. You may mention him in the personal inquiry. Attention! Quiet now! We've just launched a ship. - I see. Be careful, because it's still rolling. - Count! - One! - Stand easy. Who are you? - A little man on his way home. - But I have some vodka. Take it, please! - Shhht Ok! - Next. Who are you? - Two. Blue Wave. A guitarist, a solist. - I don't have vodka nor a guitar. But I can... - OK, don't brag. - The ladies willl forgive you, because you're beautiful as a... hairdresser. Three! - Who are you? - I'm a three. But it's a mistake. - You're all friends here and my friends went home... ...and they took my purse with money in it... ...and I go to work at 7. 30 to the grill-room. - Where? - Up there. To the grill room at the train station. - We're all going to my father. He's an artist. - He's gonna sculpt you with all your fish. You look bombastic to me. - A bomb has killed your grandpa. What's your name? - Four! - Surname? Nicknames? Addictions? - Can't tell. It's a professional secret. - Profession? - My profession? I'm a traveller. - Where to? - In all directions at the same time. And you? - Me? - Who are you? Who am I? Five. I am tired. This is an engineer and his wife. - And this is Krzys. A musician. - He invites to his place. - It's a bit late. - We can eat something, listen to some music. It's not far. At the sea. - So? - Nah, don't you see? I see. - Send Marta my regards when she wakes up. Bye. - Bye. - Just think about it. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow at most... ...we're going to go to our rancho. We'll escape from here. - We're not going to pack our things. We don't need anything there... ...when there's forest, sand and sea. - So, you came to look at it? - Damn, you scared me. How is it? - It's fine. You've been to the banquet, haven't you? - I have. Wanna smoke? - No, I don't smoke on duty. I knew you were going to come to see It. It's for you. - It's nice weather, isn't it? It's warm... - If you're hungry, help yourself. We've already eaten before you came. It's raining? I'd better hang it in the bathroom. - May I? - Sure. I'm a guest here too. Ooh... I think you confuse things that are similar. - A different towel, a different bathroom and a different lady... - Och... So it's you who were sitting next to Kid in the red Morris during the race. - Yes. You gave up back then. Did you get scared? Yeah. Let's go back to the others. - ...They were standing In line. They layed down their guns on the floor. - He approached the oldest one and asked in German: - Prot. Staszek Prot. Have you heard this name before? - Yes! - Lead the way. They entered a room full of beds. Where? - asked the partisan the German soldier. The bed #37. He was all tied with a bandage. - All except his mouth, nose and right hand, without a sleeve on. He asked: Staszek Prot. - And who are you? - I'm a partisan from the forest. - You're lying. You're not alone here. - There are two of us. - The fighting line is at the San river. Can you hear the cannons? The war will be over soon. - I fuck the cannons. I'll be over soon too. - Listen! If you want to help me, shoot me! - I'll go to heaven anyway and you'll be absolved from your sins. - The partistan rolled a cigarette from a piece of newspaper and gave him the fag. - Listen, man. Staszek! I brought you the medicine. - Really? - A very good, German medicine. Do you want to touch it? Give me your hand. - A medicine, you say... Sounds fine. - Take the holy body of Christ from a partisan. God will forgive you. - What's your name? - Shorty. Thanks, Shorty. You can go now. So that kid went to the courtyard. He heard the cannons rumbling once more. He went to the forest, slowly. He was really, really young. He didn't even shave. Then he heared a shot. - What is it? - Staszek Prot has just died. He died for his homeland. - Staszek Prot has just died. For his homeland. - That's what he said. - How old are you? 23. - Are your parents alive? - Yes. - So you were born in 1945, when the war was over. - Where did you see such scenes? I don't get it. - I watched Soviet movies, I read Babel, I watched westerns. It's all the same. Just from different time epoch. The rest is a question of my imagination and talent. You're just a transparent moron, kid. I'd hit you but I can't see where. - He pissed me off. I shouldn't have to mess up with him. Now I feel like I put my hand in shit. - Don't be surprised. They just don't understand it. - It's a different world. Different passions. - I like Krzysztof playing the piano. I'm working better then. - I don't think he's playing for me or for them, you know. He's playing for himself. That's why I like it. - Dear God. How small are our everyday matters. When you confont them with the death wall. Alarm clock set to 6:30, 3 floors, 72 steps. - A bus ticket for 1, 5 zloty, but you haven't got any change. Rain... It's not raining, fortunately. - Leaves are falling down, because you overlooked winter, spring, summer... - u? and you think they pass away. And you have to take your shirt to the laundry... ...pay the bills, buy stockings. And you have to learn 10 new English words. - Today it's Vietnam, it was Warsaw yesterday, and tomorrow... - .?? tomorrow the alarm clock set to 6:30. Three floors, 72 steps... ...one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Did you hear the shot? - I must have gone crazy. - You just fell asleep. - You must be tired, especially you. - Yes, I'm feeling weak. I have stupid hallucinations. - We have launched a ship yesterday. You know how it is... - I know, I know. Let's drink to you and your ship. - Don't care about the hallucinations. It's just your subconsciousness. I envy your job, by the way. It's a concrete, measurable skill. You produce something practical and useful. Will you walk me home? - We'll walk thrugh the beach and have a great stroll. - I don't know anything about music, but you play very well. - There are better players, you can trust me. Is it wednesday or thursday? - I'm going fishing tomorrow. I need some rest. No rain and no need to go to work. What a weak wind. 3 at most. We need to escape to our rancho. Today. In a moment. My God, it's so difficult to escape from all this. - We won't even pack out our things and fall into hot sand immediately. Then long walk on the beach... I love walking on the beach alone. Even when the weather is poor. - Finally! The dinner is ready. Come, I'll show you where we're staying. This is our bedroom. And those are our beloved twins. And now we're having dinner. - Dreams fuel our actions. - What? I think it's not true. - What the hell came to your mind. Are you hungry? - My father died in the forest. I don't even know where. The beer is on the back seat. I couldn't believe it for a long time... ...because I haven't seen it in person. - I though my dad would come back from abroad. - Or drops by as if he only went out for a walk. - Memories are behind us and one shoould look ahead. You're just tired, that's all. - If the train killed you, I could only dream that it had been just a hallucination. - After a while the door from your room would open... Wow! I thought you would never come! - You're wasting your time there in the dusty of your cities. I'm not stopping you any longer. So this is the rancho? I have forgotten... Have you forgotten? Salt... We forgot to bring salt from home. How one can eat with no salt? One kilogram of salt. - It's too close. One can't see a thing this way... -. it's just a small black spot the far end of man. - Eyes cannot be black. Only pupils can. - You only say: "she had black, hot eyes". - There was this girl named Kasia in my school. - She had one eye brown and one eye blue. Why? So tell me about it! So, they bathed together. - And then he told her the greatest myster of life. - How can man in his 40s talk about mysteries of life with 6 year old girl? - He lifted her, because the water was deep and she couldn't swim... ...and then he told her the mystery. Love is love, fun is fun... - when the gold fish dies it's always quiet. - Or something like that, I don't remember exactly. He must have been unhappy. Why are you telling me such stories? It's so quiet now that I'm afraid to breathe... Love is love, fun is fun... - When the small fish dies it's always quiet, right? Let's go to our rancho. We'll sleep the good men's dream. Like people who had spent their day well, ...because they hadn't done anything, - ...which means they hadn't done anything unnecessary. - ...then he entered the room with two beds inside. - There was a young, beautiful woman sleeping in one of them. She was his wife. She didn't like him playing the piano. - She thought he was weirdo after he got injured during the war. - Then the man took out a suitcase from under the bed. He took out a large army pistol. - He looked at the woman. She was sleeping with her mouth half-open. - He put the gun in his mouth and fired. - Some salt please. Or one kilo. I told you! Sylwia? Good morning! Yes, I'm away. Dabki, "b" like bureau. - How can I tell you... I wish you were here. I've just seen a telephone so I called you. I just wanted to talk to you. Ok. Maybe we'll see each other? Maybe we'll see each other? Ok, cheers! What? I'm not in a mood. I'm tired. I'm gonna get drunk when I'm fresh. So sleep well. - There's Piotrowska street in the city of Lodz. We've been going to amusement park there. To the razzle-dazzle. It was whirling, ladies were falling down. And the men were just watching. - The ladies with skirts over their heads. And more... Happy birthday! I won't be able to blow all those candles. - Yes? - Mr engineer? I forgot to tell you yesterday. There are lamps in the shed. Ok, I get it. Fine then. I didn't know there's a telephone here. I thought it was ringing in my head. - Thanks! - Thanks! Bye. Gdansk? Shipyard 223 please. Pawel? It's Marta. - Do you remember that it's Andrzej's birthday today? This is Sylwia and this is my wife, Marta. Hello. My god! It's so beautiful here! I envy you so much! The trees, the shadows, the sea. - Yes, it's very beautiful here. As you can see yourself... Do you have electricity here? No, but we've got Gulf Stream! Careful! It's gonna fall down! - Not now! First we've got to welcome the Polish sea! Let's run swimming, you loosers! C'mon! Faster! Hi Marta. We know each other, don't we? Right? We kissed not so long ago. - Let's drink! - Just a little. I'm still tired. - To all we have and all we love. - To the latter. I envy you, Andrzej. What are you saying, Pawel? - Your birthday, your youth, your energy and success. I missed it due to our small heroism. But I'm glad we're working together. Being a technician means something, but... ...I feel sorry. I wouldn't succeed without you, pal. There are more skilled people. - Fire can spread. The house, cars or even forest can burn. - It would be very large fire. Maybe even too large for this celebration. I'd like to ask you a question. Is Sylwia my girlfriend? No. Or have I already slept with your wife? - I'm sorry for my behaviour that evening at Krzysztof's place. You don't have to be sorry. You don't apology the kid. - Because the kid doesn't take of fence at such things. I don't envy you that war to be honest. I have my own business, boss. - I wanted to say I was sorry. But I'm not sorry anymore. No use apologizing the kids. It's good, dry wood! - I want to call my mother. - The telephone is at the attic. - You dial with the handwheel, like in the field telephone. - Have you got anything to eat? I'm hungry! Are you interested in art, books, music? No. I once went to opera for entertainment. Aren't you impressed by the fire and see here? Of course I am. But in 1945 my mother's barn has burnt. So I have seen fire in my life. I can't look at so much fire getting wasted. - And you remember that fire, although you were only 4 back then? I's normal, mom. And then, after the war? As usual. My mother bought 2 cows. And I fleed. - And now I work at the shipyard, with Andrzej. - Are you feeling unwell? - No. I feel like we shouldn't come here. We destroyed your family happiness. - Andrzej hates me and you're afraid of me. Why? Kisses. Bye! - Is it Sunday today? - Yes. - You slept in a clean bed, you have a movie ticket... ...you're boyfried will be waiting for you in a car... He saved 40.000 zlotys for a flat. It's so hot. Let's go swimming! Got a towel? Your boyfriend has bought you green pants, - You're using contraceptives and everything is fine. And you'll travel to Bulgaria in July. Do you want me to swim alone? Hold on. It's Sunday now... ...and it's raining. It's hot. The Moon is In the third quarter. It's raining. You don't have to be in hurry. - And nevertheless there are SO many people in hurry on the street. And after the movie you'll go to your place... - And it's gonna be like yesterday and the day before yesterday... ...like a month ago. Do you get what I mean? No. I don't. We were to swim naked. Let's not waste such wonderful night. I just know you're tired of that shipyard. And that stupid thoughts poisoned you. And that it all happens on your birthday. I haven't got any other gift for you. Just this swim. You'll tell me the rest of the story later. OK? I'm scared when something begins and ends. - A lot of work, then you're anxious, then it's emptiness. Idleness. You're dying slowly. And it all starts during a Sunday afternoon. - That's why I wanted to ask you, if you like Sunday afternoons. Yes. I like them very much. - I wake up late, then I take a bath and listen to some records. - You're not aware how wonderful Sunday afternoons can be. And when it's raining... ...then it's so quiet. Then I really rest. - I wish you would launch more ships like that one. I wish you more birthdays like this. - I wish you had many bathes. Naked, at night. When it's dark. Take this towel. Let's go. Who's that guy? - Are you drunk? Where's the kid's car? You'd better hurry. Wait! Wait! - You don't recognize me, engineer, it's too dark. It's him! Bravo! Here's engineer Andrzej Rudnicki. Please, sit down. It's a portrait of a hero! You can ask questions now. I just want to ask one question. Where's your... ...wife Marta at the moment? Hahahaha... How old are you actualy? You must hurry. Everything is ready. You're old, you don't have much time left. She's dead now, so you must finally decide. - Take this key. Go to seventh floor. Room 736. I'll join you in a minute. Take a bath. You're dirty. - Mommy! - Andrzej, my dear son! It was just a bad dream. - But you're not alone in this dark room. Don't be scared. Come! Let's see the snow. Can you see it? And my skies? Santa remembers about your skies. - They will be painted. - Yes, they will be. - And the sticks with leather straps? - Of course! Look, the snowflakes are so big! - I just wanted to sail on the seas. To meet interesting people. I wanted to observe this world... And then... ...delayed final exams due to war. Delayed studies. Delayed apartment. Delayed love. Delayed ship launch. Delayed summer holidays. Yesterday I had my hands full of work... ...and today... Emptiness. The first day of my holidays. - The worst thing is, that you can't forget about all that in my birthday. - Not the first and not the 15th birthday in my life. Marta! What happened? I must have fallen asleep in the sunshine. - I have a headache. Where have you been? We forgot to bring salt. I went back home to bring some salt. We must buy some beer and some fruits. - I'm exhausted. - We can go now, my dear. Is it your ship? Mine? Mine is more beautiful. And it's not ready for trip yet. THE END
