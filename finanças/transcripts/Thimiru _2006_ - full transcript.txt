Hey, come out! Come out! Please leave us. Please leave us. Sir, please leave us. Hey, where is Ganesh. He's your sister's son, isn't he? Where have you hidden him? - Sir, he hasn't come here. We don't have contacts with them since five years. We really don't know, sir. - Let us go, sir. Let us go, sir. Don't beat us. Sir, leave us! Please leave us. Pattayya, he can't be Ganesh's friend. He's a coward. He's running away with fear of life. Control your anger for a while. The moment we get Ganesh... - We'll bury him alive. They asked you about him till their throats died up. You won't tell the truth if we ask like that. You invited your death. Oh God! My face is burning. Leave me. Leave me. Hey, Ganesh, when we do this to your relatives and friends... ...imagine what we will do with you! I don't know, sir. I don't know. Who's he? - He must know it. Tell me who he is. Tell me who he is. Why are they beating him? The Medical Council has received a complaint against Bhavani. They're beating him to know who did it. Someone will come and beat you! Who's that? Who said that? How dare you to raise your voice against me! No one should do that again! Bash up everyone. Stop it. Stop it. In spite of being students... ...why are you behaving like rowdies! I'm leaving you because you're a teacher... ...or else I would have... Get lost. How dare is he to walk without any fear! Books are there for studying... ...not for throwing. Joking? Are you new to the college? Dude, we got the person we were looking for! Ganesh! See, Mrs. Parvati, let's forgive Bhavani for the last time. Just because he's the chairman's son? Our chairman built this medical college with the only ambition... ...of making the worthy students doctors. But when he comes to know that his own son... ...is giving a major trouble to other students... ...he can't bear it. He's a heart patient. I understand, sir, but they don't look like students. If you don't take action against Bhavani the next time around... ...then I will have to resign from the job. I'm sorry, sir. Yes. - Sir. Mr. Ganesh, you're joining the college... ...in the middle of the fourth year. Stay in the college and hostel premises. It's safe for you as well as us. Go and meet the hostel-warden. - Thank you, sir. "What a face you've got!" "You look like a hero." "What a face you've got!" Who's that! Who hit me just now! No one's here. Is this just an illusion? But it wouldn't hurt in that case. I wonder how many more plans they have made. I'll see. I would've seen them if God had given me... ...two more eyes behind my head. Who's hit me this time! You scoundrels. Who's he! I will see you. Oh God! Who gave me a double-dose when I was wiping my head? I'll see you. Who's he? Who was he? Who hit me so hard and disappeared in a second! Who's he! Do I look like a fool? Can you see cauliflowers in my ears? Excuse me! We can prepare different types of curries... ...with cauliflowers and you want to put them in your ears... ...like a fool! - Who's fool! Who's a fool! Do I look like a fool! The person who hit me... ...is a clever person and I am a fool. The future MPs, come here. The future MLAs, come here. There's injustice done here. You have to get me justice. What's the matter, cook? Why did you call us? - Move aside. Who hit me? - What! Someone hit you. Are you joking? Who hit me on my head when I was washing my face? Do I look like a fool. I'll break your hands and legs? Hey, someone hit the warden! We have to find him out! Stop it. Stop it. - We have to find him out! It's him. - What's the problem. Someone hit him and he wants to find out who he is. Is that all? Forget it. Let's find it out right now. Hey, everyone come here. - He's dealing with the matter. He acts like a good person and then digs a hole... ...beneath our feet. - Mr. Warden, come here. Come here. Let's find out who he is. Come. - Don't push him, or else he'll bash you up. Why did you make them sit as if it is a running race? Is that your doubt? Each cook has a unique taste. Similarly the person who hit you... ...must've his own style of hitting. And what are you going to do now. What I am trying to do is... Someone hit you here. If I make each one of them hit you in the same place... ...we can find out easily who he is. What! You'll make each one of them hit me. - Yes. Come. Wait a minute. My head started aching just with 3 hits... ...and now you want each one of them to hit me. It's my head, not a jack-fruit. Look, I forgive the person who hit me... ...and now all of you go to your rooms. We won't forgive him. We will find who he is. Hey, come here! Let's start the game. Get started. Leave my hand. You must find out who he is. It's the same double-dose. Catch him. That's a different style. - You're going back in the line. It's wrong. It's injustice. You're breaking my head. What's the matter! It puffed up like a Boori. - It hasn't puffed up, brother. It swelled a bit. - Did it swell or did it take birth here? Give that to me. Check it out. It's fine. What's this now? - Is that important to you? The people who hit you are important now. We will get you hit daily and find them out in a week. In a week. It's aching like hell. It swelled like hell. You almost damaged my brain. Is that some horn that you are pressing it? They had damaged my head... ...and now you are further damaging it, scoundrels. Warden, not only us, but he bashed up you as well. What have you done with the money we... ...collected to get Bhavani bashed up by goons. Mr. Warden, someone came to meet you. - Who's he? He's right in front of you. What's this. 'From his height and weight he looks like a cinema-hero.' 'I'll use him and get even with that Bhavani.' Hey, you! - What? - Take him to my room. I'll go talk to him. - OK. Go with him, kid. - Sir, the thing is... OK, we will do it as we talked. You go with him. Go. Go. Let's go. - I'm here. No problem. Warden, who's he? - Who's he? He's 6 foot tall hero and you're asking me who he is. He's the goon I set-up. He came in student's disguise. No one should know what's going on here... ...from now on. Be careful. What was that paper he showed you? He made a list of where and how... ...he is about to attack Bhavani. And I said it's just perfect. That's the matter. I wonder where I should... ...bring the money from to feed this demon. - We gave you. I'll slap you. That was just the advance. It costs 500 rupees per day. I only earn 4000 rupees a month. How is it possible? We'll pay. We'll pay. I trust your word. Put it here. Put it here. I will take care of that Bhavani. Go and collect the rest. OK. OK, sir. Ganesh, yours is a strange case... ...that's why I had put you in my room. Without my permission you can't move... ...or leave this room. Not only that, but you can't even talk... ...to anyone in this hostel without my permission. OK. - Did you get me? OK. You said you got it. Don't give me that serious look. Brother, good night. Switch off the lights and study. I am going to sleep. Can I make a call? - Yes, you can, sir. Hello! - It's me, Ganesh speaking. Ganesh, listen to me very carefully. You are hiding from Chinna Reddy. His men are searching for you all over the places. Their men will come to Chennai to get Pedda Reddy's bail. That's why don't go out. And take care of yourself. - OK. Don't make me a murderer. Tell me where Ganesh is. Tell me where Ganesh is! Tell me where Ganesh is! Tell me where Ganesh is! At least you tell me where he is. Get lost. Brother. - Move aside. Leave her. Leave her! Come here, ma'am. Come here. Sit down. Sit down. I told them to find out Ganesh's whereabouts. And these scoundrels! Malli, when they don't know where he is... ...how can they tell you his whereabouts? Apologize to them for your mistake. Please forgive me. - Shut up and come with me. Goodbye, ma'am. When a vegetarian like you can be so stubborn... ...then I am a non-vegetarian who's a Rayalaseema criminal. I will slash you into pieces. Do you know why I am leaving the three of you? So that I could kill the person right in front of your eyes... ...whom you are trying to protect at the cost of your life. Ganesh, you are destined to die in my hands. I knew that you would do this. Didn't I tell you not to come out and to stay in the hostel? If I see you outside one more time... Start the jeep. Hello, Maitray calling! Bhimli check-post! Helli, Maitray calling! Bhimli check-post! Hello! Hello! Yes. - Sir, four bikers have crossed... ...Madhurwadi check-post in high speed. Stop! Stop! Stop! Show me your licenses. Hi! What's the matter. - Nothing. Can we go now? - Yes, you can. Who's there to stop you! "This is a man's world just for the name's sake." "It's the woman who is ruling it." "This is a man's world just for the name's sake." "It's the woman who is ruling it." "If we talk on the cell-phone..." "...the boys come forward to pay the bill." "When we purchase something..." "...they fight each other to pay the bill." "If we talk on the cell-phone..." "...the boys come forward to pay the bill." "When we purchase something..." "...they fight each other to pay the bill."

"We change the fate of kingdoms." "This is a man's world just for the name's sake." ...in my psychology research. So you say all men are jerks. But there are some men who aren't jerks. - No, there's none. My research is 100% correct. All men are the same. What are you doing here? Are you here to study... ...or to waste your time! Go to your classes. He's a strict professor, isn't he? - Yes. Prove us that he's a jerk. - Is that all? Good morning. - Good morning. Hello! Hi, darling. - Who's this. - Sorry, I think it's wrong number. But the way you said 'who's this' gave me such a high! A lot of girls say the same. - Can we talk for a while? Are you free? - I don't have anything to do. I am free all the times. - How do you look? Have you seen 'Gajini'. I look like Surya in that movie. What! You're bald like Surya. - No. No. The way he looks in his flashback, Sanjay Ramswamy. I look like him. You know something? The cell you are talking with... Which company is it from? My company. - What! Really. Do you know how proud I am that I am talking to you! It's all in the game. Sir, please take our class. - I'm in the middle... ...of an important meeting. Do not disturb me? Will you pass your exams if I come to your class? You failed in 6 subjects. Now get lost. What did you say! - Can I really say that to you! You were talking about class and lesson... ...to someone, weren't you. Your voice reminds me of our bald lecturer Ayyappa. Why are you scolding me! - No. No. I am not scolding you. We call our professor ugly pig... ...rotten brinjal, mad dog, wild monkey and all... Don't be mean to your professor. It's not right, is it. - What's this, sir! You are feeling bad as if I am scolding you. You said you look like Surya in Gajini. - Who said so! It's me, Ayyappa speaking. - We too know that. Why is the bell at your place resounding here? You're bound to hear it when we are at the same place. Hey, you're talking from the same place! I'll slap you so hard that you'll faint. Don't mess with me. I didn't know that Ayyappa is also the same. Now do you agree that every man is a jerk. You call everyone a jerk, but some day you will also... ...fall for someone. - Just keep on watching. I hope you understood what you read... ...regarding the brain and the nervous system. To make things more clear now we will have... ...this slide-presentation. The brain is the major organ of the central nervous system. The central... - He's writing notes like a good boy. Just watch how I trouble him. - What will you do? Just keep on watching. What's the matter! He's least bothered about it. Wait a minute! I'll give it a try. What's the matter! There's no reaction. There will be one. I'll use this dummy-frog. Let's see what he does. What's happening! - I couldn't see the slides... ...and I asked Ganesh to move a bit, but he pulled me out. Ganesh, stand up! No, madam, she's the one... - Do you come here to study? Show your rowdyism outside the class. Don't come to my class hereafter. Madam, she's the one... - Just get out! I said get out! Out! Sit down, girl. Sorry, sir! We won't repeat it. - OK, you may go now. Sir. - Please sit down. You misunderstood Ganesh. You must be a bit helpful to him till he completes... ...his studies here. - OK, sir. Murali. - Madam. Ask Ganesh to give me a call. - OK, madam. OK. Hello! - Madam, it's me, Ganesh speaking. Who's that! Magesh. - Madam, I'm Ganesh. I'm not deaf. Talk slowly. - You asked me call you. I don't even know who you are. Why would I ask you to call me! - Hello! Is this 23761598? - Yes. Is madam there? - Just a second. Mummy, it's your call. - Ask him to stay on line. I'll be there in a moment. - Mummy's cooking in kitchen. She'll be here in a second. Can we talk till then? Going by your voice I think you are super sexy. Why don't you call me when my mother isn't there at home? Don't get scared. I won't tell my mother about it. This is a matter of young hearts. Do you know how many boys are chasing me? I don't know why but the moment I heard your voice... ...I lost my heart to you. Hey, shall we get married? Let's enjoy our first night after our marriage. Or else we can get married after our first night. It's your choice. I don't have a problem any which way. Please, pass the phone to madam. Don't pretend to be a Mr. Goody-Goody! My mother got a lot of ornaments made for me. All you need to do is to say 'yes'. I have already packed my luggage. If you wish we can elope. You started the mischief again. Who's that fellow. Your student Ganesh. - Give me the phone. Hello, Ganesh! My daughter was on line till now. With the excuse of research on male psychology... ...she troubles most of the boys like that. If she said something wrong... Madam, you asked me to call you. Mr. Dean told me about you and about your past. Sorry, son. From now on you can approach me... ...if you need any help for your studies. Thank you, madam. - Ganesh is a big jerk. He's not a jerk the way you think. He doesn't chase girls. He's different. He punished a girl... ...when she was disturbing him in the classroom. You too don't get bashed up by him. Now go to bed. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Lord Vinayaka, today it's my birthday. Do you know why I came to your place... ...even before cutting the cake. Because lord Vinayaka fulfills everyone's wishes. Today when I go out you'll have to be on my side... ...and keep me away from all the troubles. This is my order. If you don't follow it I'll be in trouble. Where's the temple! It's surprising. I see. So it's this way! The opening was a reserve one. Hey, you! - Hey, you. Who's that. Excuse me, please. Can you drop me at that Center? You want me to drop you. You're asking a pedestrian to drop you. I'm not going on a car, am I. - As far as I am concerned... ...you're my car and that too a costly one. So will you please help me? - Why is your face bleeding? We drink everyday and get hurt everyday. Forget it. Will you drop me at that Center? I am very busy. Ask someone else for that favor. You can't talk like that. - You're threatening me. I said it in another pitch. - I see. So you change... ...your pitch when you are drunk. - Yes. Where do you want to go? - You'll be crossing... ...that Center, won't you? - Yes. I'll get down the moment you reach it. So you confirmed that I am a car. OK, come and get in the car. Why are you hanging on me! Come on, brother! Your building is strong... ...but the basement is weak. - You too knew that. Slowly. Slowly. Just a bit slower. You are too drunk. First you drink and then you trouble everyone on road. Hey, you! Because of you they think I am also drunk! Let them think so. Where will they go at the end of the day! All of them will drink, won't they. Lord Vinayaka, I requested you to be on my side... ...but you sent this drunkard to be on my side. Is this right on your part? Do you call this justice? Lorry! I'll leave the car and get on that lorry. - Leave me. Hey, you! You drink at daytime and then you push the girls. No, no. I didn't push anyone. So you mean I'm the one who pushed you. He got on me and he pushed me on you. He might've pushed you, but you're the one who pushed me. How dare you to mess with police! - Police! Oh God! I didn't push you, madam. - Scoundrel. Now get the taste of a police-punch. Stop it! - What happened! - Stop it! Why are you beating him? - What else should I do! He pushed the lady police! - I see. So you're a lady police! Madam, beat him here as much as you want to... ...but please don't arrest him. It's a matter of our... ...hostel's prestige. - Hostel? Yes, madam. He's our hostel warden. You do such kind of things in spite of being a warden. No, I don't. - OK, give me your address. I'll call you whenever I feel like beating him. You hand him over to me. - OK. Definitely, madam. You'll call me whenever you feel like beating me. - Yes. Just look at his face. Bhavani, thanks a lot. You saved my life, or else... Hey! What's the matter you rounded up the warden... ...in the middle of the road. - Nothing happened here. You stay aside. They must know about your background. You need not tell him about anything. Just keep quiet. Our warden's brought a rowdy to the hostel to see your end. He brought him to the hostel. - Yes. He's a big fool. Don't mind what he says. Today it's my birthday. Please let me go. I see. It's your birthday. Then you have to cut the cake. You can cut anything other than the cake. - Lift him. Lord Vinayaka, so this is what you decided for me. Harrison's Textbook of Medicine is there in the library. You can refer it. - OK, ma'am. - It will be very useful for you. Who's she? She looks good. I must inform my husband who's in Canada. Look there. Call him. - Hey, Ganesh. Come here. - Come here. Come. Hello, madam! Just two seconds. We'll send him back. Come here. - We won't hurt you. He's coming here as if he's very innocent. What's the matter? Madam can't stay away from you even for two seconds! - Buddy! They're talking about the bed scene of yesterday's movie... ...and you want her to leave him just like that? Is that true? You took license for the old vehicle... ...but what about the new vehicle. You didn't get me. She's the old vehicle. And her daughter is the new vehicle. - Ganesh, let's go. Look at her. The vehicle is worried... ...that the driver might get damaged. Let's go, Ganesh. Buddy, we can't leave her just like that. If we let her go, the students won't fear us! What's the matter, Ganesh! Classes are finished. Everyone is busy... What are you doing here? I'm going to the library. - You study all the times. Don't you get bored. - Just a second. You should've reacted yesterday. If I had done so... ...my father would've known! That would've been a problem. That means you will let her go just like that. I made a nice plan to take revenge. - What's that plan? She must know we are behind it... ...but not have any proof. That's why I sent some local goons... ...to her college to break her hands and legs. Warden, we have to save her at any cost. Do you know where she studies? That college is located at 25 km distance. They will do it by the time you reach there. You can't get there even if you fly. Hold this. Brother, I saw that girl. - What are you waiting for! Break her hands and legs. You are chasing a girl. Catch her! Hey, catch her! Hey! - We are catching her, brother. Catch her! Catch her! What are you doing! You can't even catch a girl. - Buddy! It's your call. - Bhavani, watch below the door. It's not river Krishna's water, but it's petrol. You are in the chemical lab. Don't forget that. If I light a matchstick and throw it over the petrol... ...all of you will burn into ashes without leaving any evidence. Hey, open the door! Open it! Catch her. There is no way you can escape. - Who are you! It's not important who I am. That girl should reach home safely... ...or else you will reach heaven. Shall I light it? No! No! No! Ask your men to step back! Brother, we caught her. - Let her go. Why, brother. - Don't hurt her. What happened, brother? - My life is in danger. Leave this place. All of you leave. Go. Sorry. Sorry. They left her as you said. If you do such kind of foolish thing again... ...I won't leave you with a just warning. Ganesh, you lived up to your name. Like lord Ganesh stayed with his parents... ...and got what he wanted... ...and you stay here itself and finished the story. "I saw you..." - Is it true, warden? It's true. I'll make that girl confess it. - OK. I'm switching on the speaker. Everyone hear it carefully. Hello! - Hello! Are you madam's daughter? Yes. - I am Boys' hostel warden, Bangaram speaking. Yes. - Some goons attacked you in your college, right. Yes. - And one of them got a call, didn't he? - Yes. And all of them left that place after receiving that call, right. Yes. How did you know that? Are you the one who saved me? She's asking if I saved her. I can't save myself... ...and you're asking me if I saved you. Then why did they attack me. - Why? Your mother slapped Bhavani in front of everyone. So he tried to take revenge by getting you killed. But our Ganesh sent the message and threatened... ...all of them. He made them flee and saved you. Ganesh. - You don't know him. He's your mother's student. - Yes, I know him. Then why are you talking as if you don't know him. Can I talk to him? - Yes, of course. Pass this phone to Ganesh. How's it? - Superb, sir! I'm tired now. Give me a good massage. Ganesh, madam's daughter wants to talk to you. Warden asked me to pass this call to you. Hello! - Thanks a lot for saving me. Did you tell madam about what happened? No, she doesn't know about it. - Don't tell her. If she knows about this the problem can be a bigger one. OK, I won't tell her. I want to meet you. - What for? To say thanks to you. - You already said it. Look at him. After doing whatever he did... ...he's eating here as if he doesn't know anything. What's the matter, brother! - There's no salt or spice in it. Then add it. Now have it. Hey, he's eating it. - Add some prickles. Buddy, it seems that he's getting angry. Is that so? Let's check it. You're right. His eyes are also becoming red. He might be angry. 'At any cost I want to see you as a doctor...' '...but not as a murderer.' What's the matter! He's still eating. We have to show him our power. Come. Let's teach him a lesson. Pass that to me. - Here it is. He shouldn't mess with us again. Ganesh, they bashed you so hard that you needed stitches. You took so much trouble to save a girl whom you don't... ...even know and now you couldn't save yourself. Listen to me, Ganesh. If you stay here they won't let... ...you study. If you want to stay alive then leave this place... ...this night itself. That's my advice to you. Someone's knocking the door. See who it is. Who else can it be! It must be the warden. What happened? What happened? - Look there. Even after getting bashed up so hard you came here again. You are destined to die in my hands. Take out the sticks. Where has he gone? Catch him. Oh God! Being a soldier in borders is far safer... ...than being a warden in this hostel. Come. Come. The bashing that you got in the canteen isn't sufficient for you. I'm going to bury you now. Switch on the lighters. Where must he have gone? - That's what is confusing. We must kill him today. Hey, search him. Where has he gone? - He must've fled. Yesterday they had beaten him... ...but today they are scared of him. What's going on over here! I told you that day itself that some men aren't jerks. I knew that. I said that just to challenge you. I asked that Ganesh who saved me... ...that I wanted to meet him, but he denied me. Mother also told me that he's a different student. I said so many things about first night and marriage... ...and all that crap to him on phone. That's why he must've mistaken me. I will have to meet him once... ...and say a 'sorry' and a 'thanks' to him. Where will you tell that? In the college. Mother will be there in the college. Then where else will you meet him? In the hostel. - The person who sent the rowdies... ...must be staying there. - And my savior Ganesh... ...will also be there. - OK, but how will you go... ...to the gents' hostel. - I have got a plan for that. Wait a minute. Who are you? What do you want? We came here to collect old clothes... ...for those who live in orphanage. What's the matter! So many girls came to the gents' hostel. Madam's daughter also came here. Whom shall I meet here? - The warden's also there. Go and meet him. - The maid is telling them something. What is she telling them? - What kind of a person... ...is that warden. - He. He's a very nice person. He speaks what is there in his heart. Go and meet him. Not only old clothes... ...but he will also collect money for your orphanage. Stop there! You came to the men's hostel with so many girls. And you are also madam's daughter. Don't you have minimum commonsense! The students of this hostel follow my orders diligently... ...and are in my control. Do you know that! Now when they see you girls and if they get tempted... ...and commit some mistake, then whom will I answer? I feel I am also getting tempted. Get lost. Hello, bring down your hand. No one came here to flirt with the boys. We came here to collect old clothes for orphanage. There are no clothes here. Get out of this place. The maid said a lot about you. - I know what she said. What did she say? - She said that I am selling... ...the pulses and spices of the hostel outside, right. - No. No. What else must she have told? Did she say that I am extracting money... ...from everyone in this hostel by threatening them... ...that I brought a rowdy to this hostel. No. - She didn't say that as well. But I haven't committed any other mistake. You tell me what she said. She said that you're a nice person. But you are behaving like a... Did she say that I am a nice person? - Yes. That means I'm the one who told all these about myself. Hey! - Keep this matter between both of us. Can we go inside now? - That's not possible. You have to go out. - That's possible. I'll make it possible. You'll make it possible. What'll you make possible? I'll shoot you if you don't leave this place. I already shot you. - What did you shoot? I shot the video of whatever you just said with this phone. Oh devils! What kind of a mischief is that! That's one of her old habits. Her father is a police commissioner. And she shoots criminals like you everyday and sends it... ...to her father, and then he takes care of the rest. 'He takes care of the rest.' - If you don't let us go inside... ...he'll break your bones tomorrow morning. Why? What have I done wrong? You are educated girls. I didn't want you to get spoiled. But you shoot everything about me. Now come in. I'll strip them and hand you over their clothes. Come in. We can meet Ganesh, can't we? We will note down the names when we take clothes. We can find his name in that way. Have you seen the board! Only for members. It's not for outsiders, but they hung that notice... ...keeping the warden in mind. It's OK. I'll open the door for you. Have you seen how they have worn ladies' dresses... ...and dancing like woman! They are very cheap fellows. What else have they got to do other than that! Let's go to another room. What are you doing! It's full of smoke. They are doing drugs. How many of you are taking drugs? All of us are doing it together. Not only drugs, but we will also take beer and brandy... ...and if you come inside we will beat you as well. You'll beat me as well. - You are right. If we leave him aside they will turn the hostel into a bar. Let's file a complaint against them in police station. I said it unnecessarily that they are good guys. If I don't teach them a lesson... Sir! There's no problem. We are talking just like that. - Sir. You carry on. I'll follow you. Go away. 'How did the guys of this room know that I threatened...' '...the guys of the other room of police arrest!' 'All the rooms are separated from each other.' 'They must've contacted through cell phones.' Hello! What happened inside? They asked me some doubts. I just cleared it. Why would there be sounds if you cleared the doubts! There are hundred kinds of sounds... ...when we clear the doubts. Do I need to explain everything. I fear I'll get stripped by the time I get you clothes. There are no clothes here. Go away. Go away. Hello! What about the rest of the rooms? Rest of the rooms. Get out of here. Who knows what other guys are doing in their rooms! I'm not sure if we'll return safe if we go to their rooms. Please go away. Go. - Hello! Hello! Oh God! She got my weak-point in the cell-phone. Let's go. What other option do I have! Bu you won't get even a single handkerchief over there. Come. Come with me. We didn't get even a single lungi. - Mr. Warden. What! - You want clothes, don't you. - Yes. Why think about old clothes! We will give you the clothes that we are wearing. I told you again and again, but you didn't listen to me. Thanks to you we missed a catastrophe by a wink. Sorry, sir, but we didn't come here for old clothes. What else did you come here for? We came here for Ganesh. - For Ganesh! I would've taken you there had you told me earlier. OK, leave it. But you must bring Ganesh to the place... ...of my choice tomorrow. - And what if he doesn't agree. Hello! Then this will be in the police station. I'm caught. What other option do I have! What's that! Banana peel. Someone might've put it here intentionally. What's the matter, Ganesh! You're looking here and there... ...with a bag in your hand. Are you going home? Why are you moving your head in all the directions! Move it in just one direction. OK, forget it. You know Parvati ma'am, don't you. Her daughter came to the hostel to meet you. I told her that girls shouldn't enter men's hostel. So I told her that I will take you to her and then send her back. Shall we go now? What are you thinking about? - OK. Stay here. I'll go inside and wear my underwear... Sorry, I'll wear my pant. Stay here. I'll be back in a second. Come, let's go. What happened? Where has he disappeared in a second! Why is he jumping the walls? Is he a student or a thief! Lie down. Did Ganesh come here with his mother and father? He didn't come here, brother. Hey! He didn't take them to none of the villages... ...where they treat them in ancient methods. He didn't take them to any hospital. Where is he getting his mother and father treated? Ganesh! I won't leave you wherever you are. Mother. Ganesh. - Are you OK? My son doesn't have peace wherever he goes. Mother, where's father. Son. Ganesh. Your uncle told me about everything. Why are you crying? - You're my son. I fear what will happen to your life. These girls are troubling me a lot... ...with my video in their cell phone. Today I'll introduce them to Ganesh... ...and get rid of all the trouble. Hello, is that Ganesh. I came to the market to buy some vegetables. I've got no one for help here. Can you come here? Can you come? - OK, I'll come. - OK, come here. Thank God, he's coming. Now I can call that girl as well. Hello! It's me, warden speaking. Ganesh is coming here. You too come to the market. Are you coming here? - I'm coming. 15 minutes. OK, come soon. Thank God, half my job is done. You miser, aren't you ashamed to drink my drink. You don't even have minimum civic sense. You ugly dog. You are drinking it as shamelessly as a pig drinks. It would be better if you drink others pee. You aren't even bothered about it. Whom do you want to drink the pee? - You. Me. Why? - You must drink it. You drank the cold-drink that I bought for myself. It would be better if you drink others' pee. Hey, I paid money for the drink. - I paid the money. You bought it. - Yes. Didn't I pay you for the drink? - Yes. - Tell that to him. Didn't I pay you for the drink? - Don't beat me. You too paid the money. - Tell him. Then where's the drink that I bought. Why are you asking me? Ask the shop-keeper. Where is it? Tell me where it is. - Now I'm in trouble. Wait a minute. I'll search it. Brother, your drink is in the dustbin. Hey, you! First you throw your cold-drink in dustbin... ...and then when I buy a drink for myself... ...you ask me to drink others' pee. Not one person's, but more than one person's. Scoundrel, now every time I'll drink a cold-drink... ...you'll come to my mind. - It's your mistake. And what's that. - Your first mistake is to buy... ...a similar cold-drink to that of mine. And then you drank super-fast as if there is no tomorrow. That's your second mistake. When you drink like that I thought you were a thief... ...and I scolded you. Let bygones be bygones. Now we have got nothing to do with each other. You go your way and I'll go my way. Hey, you're trying to escape. I shaved off my head. You want to play drums on my head. I don't play drums. - Now I'll play the drums. What the heck! Oh God! Oh God! Leave me. Leave me. What's the matter. What are you doing? You must pee like a dog for the next five years. O mother! He's taken off a pound of flesh. Earlier they used to beat us and now they are biting us. They change the trends every now and then. Neither Ganesh is here nor is that girl here. Warden. - Are you here! Come here. Warden, did you buy everything. - No. We'll have to go and buy now. What's this, warden! You said it on phone... ...that you bought everything. - What's the big deal! We can buy everything in just five minutes. Let's go in. No, I'll go back. Warden, I can't stay out for long. Please listen to me. - Let's go in. - You too come with me. Sorry. - Come with me, Ganesh. Let's go in. Please listen to me, warden. Try to understand me. It's a matter of just five minutes. - I'm leaving. You too come with me. Here is your sleeve. "Please listen to me. Please listen to me." "Tell me what your problem is." "It's not a mistake. It's not a mistake." "Accept the girl when she wants to fall in your arms." "You'll faint when you see that girl." "When you see her legs they will remind you of swans." "When you see her hands you'll want to..." "...shake hands with her." "When she comes in front of you..." "...you'll fall in love with her." "You must give such a strong kiss that it'd leave a scar." "You must kiss her cheek and turn it red." "You must kiss her and make her blush." "And her blush should be the approval of your love." "Please listen to me. Please listen to me." "Tell me what your problem is." "It's not a mistake. It's not a mistake." "Accept the girl when she wants to fall in your arms." "Don't assume everyone to be a nice person." "Some of them can push you into hell." "Don't think that money is more valuable than people." "People will curse you behind your back." "If you have a couple true friends..." "...then your life will be filled with happiness." "Only when a person is good to others..." "...he can afford a bit arrogant." "Then you won't have any stopping." "You must kiss her cheek and turn it red." "You must kiss her and make her blush." "And her blush should be the approval of your love." "Please listen to me. Please listen to me." "Tell me what your problem is." "It's not a mistake. It's not a mistake." "Accept the girl when she wants to fall in your arms." "You'll faint when you see that girl." "When you see her legs they will remind you of swans." "When you see her hands you'll want to..." "...shake hands with her." "When she comes in front of you..." "...you'll fall in love with her." "You must give such a strong kiss that it'd leave a scar." "You must kiss her cheek and turn it red." "You must kiss her and make her blush." "And her blush should be the approval of your love." Where is Ganesh? Where is Ganesh? - He must be somewhere around. Haven't you seen him. So you are dancing here without noticing if he's gone. You are not scared of me anymore. I must release the video. - O madam, what can I do! I was dancing here and he ran away. He's shivering when I take your name. What have you done? If I miss him the next time you'll be in big trouble. He only cares about his studies... ...and she only cares about him. It's impossible to bring them together. I will have to do it. Or else my life will be in danger. I will bring them together. Hey, Ganesh! Madam's daughter wants to meet you. - What for? You don't know what it is for. Why do you ask me as if you don't know anything? Why would a young girl want to meet a young boy? She loves you. That's why she wants to meet you. Ganesh, you go to her directly and meet her. If you like her tell her that you like her... ...or else tell her that you don't like her. Then I'll take care of the rest. I'll call the girl right now. You ask her where you'd meet her. Warden. - She's torturing me like hell. It's ringing. Talk to her. Talk to her. Hello! - It's me, Ganesh speaking. It's Ganesh. Oh God! I really can't believe it. What's the matter you called me all of a sudden? Listen to me carefully. I want to meet you. I am in Coimbatore. I came to attend a friend's marriage. Please. Please. Can we meet tomorrow. I'll come to your college and meet you. No. Just tell me when and which bus you're coming in. Tomorrow I'll be coming in the Coimbatore-bus. I'll come to the bus-stand and meet you. Ganesh, you haven't seen that girl. That's why I will also come there. OK. - OK. - OK. I told you that day itself that you'll fall for someone. It must be this guy. - No. No. There's nothing like that. I want to meet him just to say a 'sorry' and a 'thanks'. That's all. 'I lied to him that that girl loves him. And he believed it.' 'What if he beats me up after knowing the truth?' Guru. - Yes. - Please give me your cell-phone once. Here it is. Hello! - What's the matter, Ganesh, you went there alone? I told you that I would be coming with you, didn't I. No, warden, actually you were asleep, so I thought... You don't know that girl. She doesn't know you. Then how will you recognize that girl... ...and how would you talk to her. - I'll take care of that. Are you going to tell her that you love her? - No, warden. I don't want any sort of trouble due to that girl. That's why I want to meet her directly... ...and want to tell her that I don't love her. But she doesn't love... Hey, wait a second! All these day I've been missing meeting Ganesh by a wink. Today I am about to meet him. I don't know why... ...but I am very excited about it. Hello! - It's me. Are you here? I got down the Coimbatore-bus and I'm waiting for you. Which color dress are you wearing right now? - Why? So that I could recognize you. - OK. Yellow chudidar. OK, I'll be there. Hey, the bus is here. Come. Welcome, Malli. Welcome. You called us and asked us to come to the bus-stand. Do you want us to kill someone? Tell me what the matter is. - Give me a puff. To get the bail for brother Pedda Reddy. Brother, brother Chinna Reddy hasn't come. He's a bit busy. He said that he will come here... ...on the next bus. - I see. Hey, Ganesh! Why are you so surprised! Aren't you happy to see your villager. Haven't you recognized me. I am your neighbor Venkatlakshmi's husband. I heard that you are doing doctor's course. Are you doing it back home or are you studying here? Do your parents come here to see you? Are they coming here today? Is that why you came here? You have mistaken me with someone else. What's the matter he's leaving like that? The bus is about to leave. Who's that! Watch yourself out. - Malli. Picchayya! How are you? - I'm fine. How's your wife and kids? - They are fine. It's been 5-6 years since we met... ...but still you're asking me about my family. Just a couple of minutes ago one of our villagers saw me... ...but gave me cold shoulder. That's why I am a bit upset. Who's that villager who ignored you? Who else! It's our Ganesh. - Which Ganesh? The Ganesh who lives in the temple lane. Are you sure that you saw him? When did you see him and where did you see him? I saw him in this bus-stand a couple of minutes ago. The Ganesh whom we are looking for is right here. Just behead him. Take out the knives. Hey, you go that way and you go that way! Search him. Hey, come here. Come here. The girl's there. Come here. Come here. Look there. She's there. - Ganesh. Not Ganesh. The girl is there. She has escaped. I'll take care of her. You search him. Go! Hello! - I'm waiting. Tell me honestly which color dress you are in. I am wearing yellow chudidar. Why are you asking me the same question again and again? A lot of girls have worn yellow colored dress here. That's why I'm asking you. You got confused because of the same color dresses. OK, leave it. Tell me about some landmark near you. Fourth platform. There's a poster of the movie... ...'Monagallaki Monagadu' to the light-post. I'm right there. OK, I saw you. I'm right behind you. What! What happened? Hey, you scoundrel Ganesh! I sent my men to bring you and you're hugging a girl here. Hey, cut both of them into pieces. Leave this place right now. Leave this place! Yes, I am Ganesh. The Ganesh whom you're searching. My brother's coming. He'll take good care of you. Hey, come with me! Brother, Ganesh is in the bus-stand. Didn't I tell you about that girl! He's here with that girl. Why! Why! All I wanted was to become a doctor. Why? Why do you want to take revenge? I told you so many times to stay away from me. You want to make me a killer, don't you. I'm ready for that as well. Brother! Brother's here! I came here to cut you into pieces the moment I see you. But now your life has no meaning for me. You're in love with the person who made you my enemy. I'll kill her within just 3 days... ...and then I'll make you weep the way we wept... ...and then I'll kill you. If I don't do so then I am not born... ...on the soil of Rayaseema. Hey! I was also born on the same soil. Do you think you are just an ordinary person? You bashed them up like hell. And also I lied to you that she loves you. But that girl ran to you and hugged you. Do you already know that girl? Who are you? Who is she? What's going on over here? "The racing horse has agreed to unite with the fighting bull." "She pulled my heart with a fishing pole." "I have mustache and manliness." "I have strength and courage." "And I'm old enough to hunt the girls." "We want the girls to look at us." "And when they see us we want them to talk to us." "Girls are our world." "Just march forward." "And win every battle." "Just march forward." "There's no stopping to you." "Just march forward." "The racing horse has agreed to unite with the fighting bull." "She pulled my heart with a fishing pole." "You're the flower that attracts every bee." "You're the cynosure of all the eyes." "You're the fruit which everyone wants to taste." "You spread fragrance wherever you go." "When she smiles my heart skips a beat." "When she looks at me I go mad." "I have a heart and there is a girl." "I saw this girl and I lost my heart." "I want my heart back." "Or I want that girl back." "The racing horse has agreed to unite with the fighting bull." "She pulled my heart with a fishing pole." "Shall we build another Taj Mahal?" "Shall we hit their cheeks with some kisses?" "Shall we hunt them down?" "Shall we quench the thirst?" "I'll will my name on your name." "If you accept it I'll will myself to you." "The guy with a heart has liked you and praised you." "He came here with his heart in his hands." "The racing horse has agreed to unite with the fighting bull." "She pulled my heart with a fishing pole." "I have mustache and manliness." "I have strength and courage." "And I'm old enough to hunt the girls." "We want the girls to look at us." "And when they see us we want them to talk to us." "Girls are our world." "Just march forward." "And win every battle." "Just march forward." "There's no stopping to you." "Just march forward." Madam, yesterday our Ganesh was dancing with a girl... ...near the temple and during the entire ceremony. I saw him while I was washing clothes. I thought of informing you about it. OK, goodbye. Do humans reside here? It's full of smoke. As if I came straight out of some factory. What a boring cassette! Is there some movie going on? Why are you staring at me? Go and mind your own business. "Who let the dogs out?" I kept it right here. Where's my shirt? Mom, where's my shirt that I kept here? Where has it gone? I'm ironing it. - You're ironing it. Oh mom! Who asked you to do that! How many times do I have to... ...tell you that these shirts are not meant to be ironed. I can't use it anymore. You wasted it. Hold this. I'll wear this one. - Why are you wearing old shirt? Wear a new one. When did he listen to me! What are doing here? - To have some breakfast. I know that. Don't you have minimum common sense, old lady. Why are you screaming like that? - What else should I do? If you hit someone with it he may start bleeding. Look at it. It's as hard as a rock. No, it's not. It's pretty soft. Tell him it's soft. - She's right. Hello, Mr. Dumb, it's your misfortune. She's your wife. You'll have to bear these idlis... ...as you married her. I wonder what sin I have committed... ...in the last birth that I became your son the present birth. Why are you laughing? - Don't you know why? Ever since yesterday you've been pretending to do... ...some mistake or other to get punished by us. We are laughing at your silly attempts. - Oh mom! You found it out. - We didn't scold you ever since... ...you were born, then how can we scold you on your birthday! Kids ask their parents to buy them a watch... ...or a motor-cycle, or a car, as per their father's position. And you want... - We always want what we don't get. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. - He's here. Now he's here. Sister-in-law, the smell of the chatni... ...has reached the end of this street. Give me some. - Serve him some. He's getting the Tiffin for free. Why would he leave it? Mother, hasn't this man ever seen food earlier. Sister-in-law, isn't there some ginger-prickle. There's sambar. - It will do. Mother, give him this one. That one as well. I am offending you like a beggar... ...and you aren't reacting even a bit. Have you become deaf. Who gave you an inspector's job? Your plan didn't work out with brother and sister-in-law. Now you are trying your tricks with me. Look, they might fall for your tricks, but I'll never scold you. It didn't work out even with you. Sister-in-law, did you tell him the matter. No, I can't tell him. - What? - You tell your nephew. Brother, at least you could've told him about it. Why do you want to get me scolded? What's the matter? - Nothing really. I'll tell you what the matter is. I told you that I will come to the temple with you. I can't come there. I'm not in a position to come there. I didn't get you, uncle. - They transferred me to Chennai. I have to go to Chennai to come back to Madurai. You finish your Tiffin first of all. I'll talk to you later. Sister-in-law. My luggage. My luggage. - It's ready. Luggage. You have already preplanned it. Mother, he can't go. Hey, stop there! Stop there! Goodbye, sister-in-law. Take care. You're escaping. Come again. You'll see what I'll do. Look at him, mother! I saw him. He's there in his house. Hey, you coward! You shameless eunuch! Scoundrel, don't you know that you should return the money... ...when you borrowed it. Don't you know that you should return the money. Madam, please don't hurt my husband. So you're entering your house like a thief at night-time... ...so that you could escape from me... ...and abscond the money. We have come to your home for our money. Hey, if you don't return the money in half an hour... ...along with the interest then I'll behead you... ...in front of Mother in the temple. Madam, the person who borrowed money from you... ...fled from the town. For the mistake of signing the papers... ...as his reference I paid double the interest. Please give me some respect for at least that. So you want respect, sir. Here it is. This is the respect Eeshwari gives others. Scoundrel, you tried to fool me... ...as my brothers are not there in town. I'm a man without a mustache? Hey, you're talking too much. Who is she? - She's my sister's daughter. She came from Chennai. - You came here as a guest. So have some free meals, and then get lost. But don't ever get involved in our personal matters. Or else you can't leave this town in one piece. Within half an hour you must pay the entire money. Madam, where will we get 3 lakhs from in just half an hour! Give us one week's time. I'll mortgage my head... ...to get the money if required. - What! This ugly head. Give me one week's time, madam. We'll return the money at any cost. One week. Have you gone mad! I'll give you some advice to return my money. Even after giving birth to a child... ...still you have maintained your sexy figure. When you come out of the house... ...men definitely lust for you. I'm pretty sure about it. Instead of being the wife of an impotent like him... ...if you sleep with men who earn some money... ...you can return my money within no time. What are you staring at! Answer me. Hey, I'll file a case against you in the police station... ...for taking illegal interest and send you behind bars. You're talking about law with me, who did graduation in law! If you really feel so bad about your aunt... ...why don't you sleep with men and make some money! What shall I do with her, Malli? Cut her into pieces, sister. When 6 feet tall men don't dare to look into my eyes... ...and stand 3 feet away when I walk by. How many hearts do you have to mess with me... ...in spite of being a chickenhearted girl! For your mistake of raising hand on my body... ...everyone here will see you without a piece of cloth... ...on your body. O my God! Look at him, Malli. He's lord Krishna who lent a cloth to Panchali! Remove the remaining clothes from his body... ...and bash him up till he dies. People should know that whoever messes with Eeshwari... ...gets the same fate. O sister! Are you a woman? Are you a woman? You won't understand it with words. You'll understand it only with deeds. You're feeling embarrassed at such thing... ...even though you treat yourself as a man. Then assume what that girl might be going through. Ganesh. Let's go. - Start living like a girl from at least... ...now on. You! - Let's not get into these things. Look at her, father, what she did to her! Hey! You scoundrel! How dare you to touch Eeshwari... ...and then leave the place as if you did nothing! The moment you touched me you became my husband. This Friday you touched my dress. The next Friday I'll make you touch my body... ...as my husband. Who are they? Your parents. So they are my in-laws. Please give me your blessings. Please bless me. Let bygones be bygones. Mother, there's no need to talk to a woman like her. Hey, you kid! Don't you know there's something called courtesy! I'll teach you everything after I marry me. Father-in-law! Mother-in-law! Take your son away... ...before my mood changes, or else... If he keeps on irritating me like that... ...I might even stab him and become a widow. Leave this place before I count till ten. Malli. - Sister. Start counting. - One, two, three, four... One. - Let's go. Move. Five. Six. Sister, he is gone. It's not 'he' is gone. Say 'brother-in-law' is gone. Bring your brother-in-law's complete bio-data... I'll bring it by evening, sister. I'm caught. Brother, sister asked me not to tell you anything. What were you doing! What were you all doing, cowards! Chinna, are you here! Your sister is sitting... ...like she has gone mad. Go and see her. Sister, your brother hasn't died yet. I didn't know about this matter... ...till some outsider told me in Kadapa. Where's his house? - Brother, it's house no. 7 in temple lane. He made my sister sit in a corner... ...who used to live like a princess till now. I won't live in peace till I kill him. Come with me, you scoundrel. - Coming, brother. O my foolish brother, wait a second! You'll go there and kill him. And what about me then. I had hidden it from both of you... ...as I knew that you would do something like this. Only after taking permission from our family... ...the sun rises in this town. The entire town is saying that... ...that kid pulled the scarf of a girl... ...who was born in such a big family. How would it be if I make him tie me the nuptial thread? People will praise this Eeshwari... ...for making him marry me after he insulted me in public. Chinna, why are you staring like that! The person who pulled my scarf is not a kid in shorts. He's the lion of this province. - What are you saying, dear! I'm saying that he's my husband. I'm getting married the next Friday. We are coming to your home on Saturday for dinner. Tell sister to prepare native chicken curry for us. Get lost. Get lost. Hey. - Yes, dear. Come here. - Yes, sweetheart. It's your only sister's marriage. You too might want to get me see married. That's why I want you to leave this place... ...as you may cause some trouble if you stay here. Foolish girl, everything will happen as per your wish. Both of you come home for dinner. - Thanks, brother. Call me when you reach there. - OK, dear. Malli. - Yes, sister. Let's go and see how my in-laws' place looks like. Sister. Sister, this is the place you will be living in... ...after marriage. What's the matter! There is a marriage in their house... ...in a few days, and the house still looks so dull. What do they think of themselves? Go. Go and bring my mother-in-law, father-in-law... ...my husband, whoever there is. Go. Go. - OK, sister. What's the matter! So you haven't forgotten... ...the bashing that you got from him. I would've gone inside. But I am about to marry him... ...and I shouldn't go to his house before marriage... ...as per the rituals. Go inside and call him immediately. If you don't go there I'll cut the remaining leg that you have. Go there! I said go! He's walking like a swan. Sister. - Go inside. Sister! How dare you to send him back! I will... You'll die if I slap you. - Your anger is what... ...makes me go mad about you. Please come, mother-in-law and father-in-law. I came here with so much love and see how your son is... ...talking to me. What's the matter, my would-be-husband! You are about to tie me the nuptial thread... ...in a couple of days and you are still fighting with me. I never think about something that is not going to happen. Even I won't leave you without marrying you. Go away. Go away! Get lost! You asked me to get lost the way husbands say their wives. The wife must follow husband's orders. I'll follow your orders. Tomorrow it's Thursday. The day after tomorrow it's Friday. And then it's our wedding day. Ganesh, don't get into these things. Come in. Come in. Let's go inside. - Why don't you care me at all! Are you scared that an arrogant girl like me... ...won't make a good wife and a good daughter-in-law. I will also live like a good wife. I will come to your house and be a good daughter-in-law. Malli, let's go. - It's aching, sister. I'll get you a quarter-bottle wine on the way. It's really aching a lot. OK, fine. I won't get you a quarter... ...but I'll get you a half-bottle wine. Half bottle. That might cure my wounds. But today it's Gandhi Jayanti. - We'll get a bottle from touts. Ganesh. - Sir. - Just a second. I heard about whatever happened. Eeshwari's brothers are stuck in a murder case... ...since two years and that's why they are hiding... ...in their in-laws' places. Now that girl is handling their business. Beware of that Eeshwari. As a principal of this college I'm ready to give you... ...any help that you need. - Thank you, sir. Concentrate on your studies. - OK, sir. Take care. - OK. - Bye. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law Ganesh. O deaf brother-in-law, wait a minute. Brother-in-law, it's me. What's the matter you came here! You got beaten up by me yesterday itself! Those sort of things are quite common for me. I have been calling you and you were running away. That's why I called you deaf brother-in-law. Don't tell this to sister. She will cut my tongue. She loves a lot, brother-in-law. - Get lost. I came here at morning, but they didn't open the school... ...at that time. So I went to a bar and had a few drinks... ...and came here. What's the need for you to study! I'll kill the chief doctor of the main hospital... ...and put you in his seat. Get lost. I came here to give you this card. Sister asked me to give you this card. It's the wedding card. I came here to see why he didn't return till now... ...after giving wedding invitation. And you are showing him your power! Show me your power on our first night if you wish. Just make a few things clear to me. Sooner or later you'll marry a girl and father a child with her. So why don't you marry me and father my child. I'll give you a healthy Farex-baby. Men fight among themselves for even the most mediocre girls. And I, on the other hand look gorgeous from every angle. I just want to know why you don't like me. Tell me. You and I are getting married tomorrow itself. You'll come to me and tie the nuptial thread. Or else I'll make you tie me the nuptial thread. Hey! When girls talk at low pitch boys pamper them. But if you try to dominate the boys... ...no one will show any interest towards you. Wife bows down her head and gets the nuptial thread tied... ...but makes her husband lift his head with pride. And what good will a marriage do to an arrogant girl like you! Girls should have patience, but not arrogance. First learn to be a girl. Then you can search for a husband. "You are making me go wild." "There is fire in my heart. Check it with your hand." "You can't stop me now. I'll chew you down." "Come to me and give me pleasure." "My body is burning with lust." "I am going out of control." "Cupid's arrow has struck in my heart." "I'm floating with joy in the air." "You are making me go wild." "There is fire in my heart. Check it with your hand." "I want you to look only at me." "You are my prince charming." "Take me into your hands and show me your strength." "Show me your anger." "Hug me tightly with your arms." "Crush me and make me cry." "Let's enjoy this moment." "Make this night the night of lifetime." "You are making me go wild." "If you make me one promise my sorrows will end." "If you stop being stubborn my joys will begin." "You are wasting such a beautiful day." "Come to me and get dirty with me." "There are some new wishes in my heart." "Twist my body the way you want to twist." "Come, let's get wet in the water." "Come, let's enjoy this moment." "You are making me go wild." "There is fire in my heart. Check it with your hand." "You can't stop me now. I'll chew you down." "Come to me and give me pleasure." "My body is burning with lust." "I am going out of control." "Cupid's arrow has struck in my heart." "I'm floating with joy in the air." What's the matter the electrician's house is locked. Sister, he paid the money he owed us... ...and got transferred to Chittor. And why are you asking about him now. He's the reason I'm getting married to my husband. I thought of taking his blessings after my marriage. He's not destined to bless you. What's the matter it seems That it is about to rain! This is not rain, sister. Gods and Goddesses... ...are blessing flowers on you from the sky. What's the time now. It's 10.10, sister. He hasn't come here yet. There is only 20 minutes left to the auspicious moment. Call him and bring him on the line. - OK, sister. Father-in-law, the marriage is about to take place... ...from 9.30 to 10.30. The in-laws are here by 7 O' clock. But your son hasn't come yet. How did you bring him up! He is a real man... ...but still I want to clear my doubts. That's why I am asking this question. Please don't mind it. If you were in your son's place and if you would've seen... ...a girl like me, wouldn't you had lusted for me. Tell me. Hello! - Sister, brother-in-law is on line. Give me the phone. - Hello, darling. Have you gone mad. - You're the one who got mad. Instead of marrying me and researching on me on first night... ...you are researching dead bodies. Hey, scoundrel, if you come here and tie me... ...the nuptial thread your home will be safe. Or else it'll turn into graveyard. - What did you say! I'm saying that your mother and father will reach heaven. Then you can research with three bodies. Their lives are in my Scorpio right now. I can send them to heaven. - Hey, you... You must come here within ten minutes... ...and then you must tie me the nuptial thread. Then you can do anything with me. Here's my husband. Come here. Where will you go! Tie me the nuptial thread. Tie me the nuptial thread. There is only ten minutes to the auspicious moment. Tie me the thread. First of all learn to be a woman. Only then think about marriage. Hey, you won't listen to me if I speak calmly. Hey, break his hands and legs... ...and make him tie me the nuptial thread. Let's go. - Ganesh. Hey! Stop. Tie me the nuptial thread. Tie me the nuptial thread. I said tie me the nuptial thread. Shut up! Show your power to someone else, but not to me. I told you earlier and I am telling you again. First learn to me a girl. Only then think about this. Hey! Tie me. Tie me. Tie me the nuptial thread. I told you I am a man without a mustache? Then beating you won't be unethical. Let's go, mother. If I don't get you... ...no one else will get you. O sister! Why did you do this to sister, O God! Water. Water. Bring some water. - Bring some water. Stop crying. I won't die till elder brother comes here. Water, brother. Sister. Call elder brother. - Call him, Malli. Move aside. Move aside. Sir. Sister, what happened to sir. He returned from the magistrate office... ...and said that his heart was aching. We fear that he might leave us, sir. Sir did a lot of favors to me. But I couldn't do anything for him in return, sister. Sir won't leave us. Don't cry. Brother, did you make a call to the doctor. I called the doctor half an hour ago, but he didn't come yet. Give him a call again. Hello, Dr. Murthy here! - If you want to stay alive... ...you need to be here within five minutes. There was a block in his heart. So he struggled with breathing till now. You need not worry anymore. He will come back to senses within half an hour. - OK. Goodbye. - Thank you, doctor. Please forgive me if I had said something wrong. You need not apologize. You used those words... ...only because of your love for the patient. Goodbye. Move back. Move back. He needs some air. Didn't I tell you, sister, that sir will be fine! Sir. Sir. Did you recognize me? What do you need, sir? I got it. I got it. I'll do it. Brother, hold him for a second. Slowly. Slowly. Sir, did you come back to senses. Sir, can you hear my words? Now my heart is filled with joy. Do you think you are some hero? I was running my business smoothly... ...and you informed the police about my misdeeds. I asked the inspector that who dared to file a complaint... ...against me and he gave me your name. And when I reached here you tried to betray me... ...by dying on your own. That's why I brought you back to life to kill you again. Sister, have I said something wrong. Tell me. Brother. Brother. - Why are you crying here? Sister has... - Sister has. Who are you? Who are you? Leave us. Brother, that kid is not there at home. He must be somewhere outside. Where is your son? Where is he? I am leaving you alive just for my sister's sake. You must welcome her when she comes to your house... ...as your daughter-in-law. If something happens to my sister I'll kill all of you. The way I felt, the way I wept when my brother told me... ...about my sister... You should also go through the same pain for your son. Brother, I can't see. I can't talk. The person whom your sister loved... Don't let him become a doctor and make him regret... ...saying no to me. I'm the one who should become his wife... ...but no one else should, brother. No one else should, brother. We must cut him into pieces, brother. Brother, you arrange for sister's last rituals I will be back after killing him. Brother, police is coming here to arrest you. Malli, take him away. - No. Go away. - No. You should stay out to get me on bail. Go away. Go, brother. - Come, brother. Move aside. Move aside. - Welcome. Welcome. So you'll arrest me. I heard that you got transferred to Chennai. When did you come? Shall I handcuff you or will you come on your own? What's the matter, you are talking too much. So that you could save your nephew. You're talking too much. You killed Rajampeta's president. When the villagers filed a complaint against you... ...I got orders to arrest you. You can't come out again. Look, even if I stay in the jail your brother's son... ...can't become a doctor. He'll become a dead body. You're threatening me. Come! Brothers, build my sister's grave... ...between that of my mother's and father's. Don't leave him. He can't stay alive. Kill him. Don't leave him. Who are you? Who are you? - Come outside! Where is he? You want to make him a doctor. Tell me where he is. - I really don't know where he is. He's really not coming to college. What are you saying! - Brother, he'll be able to study... ...only if he has got his certificates. Where are his certificates? Give me his certificates. They are in Ganesh's certificates. - Bring them here. Here they are. - Check it out. It is in English. Are these his certificates? - Yes. Don't tear it, brother. His studies will be ruined. Now tell me can he become a doctor now? Can he become a doctor now? - No. Eeshwari's brothers won't let Ganesh study well. That's why I arranged for him to study... ...in Chennai's medical college. - How long will this go on, sir! If I keep on running away from them... ...I will have to run all my life. They won't leave me no matter wherever I go. This will go on only till we catch Chinna Reddy and his gang. Till then you should study in Chennai. Our department will take care of you there. Uncle, who will take care of them if I leave! When I can save you can't I save them? Don't worry about them. Their knives will kill you. But a knife in your hand will save many lives. But if you stay here they will turn you into a killer. At any cost we want to see you as a doctor... ...but not as a killer. Ganesh, no matter whatever the problem is... ...keep your head calm and solve the problem amicably. Ganesh, he challenged you that he will kill you and that girl... ...just within three days. What will you do now? Hello! - I came in search of your lover... ...but she went to college in search of you. I sent my men to kill her there. Your enmity is with me. Don't hurt her. Come. Come here! We will kill her first and then we will kill you. Brother! - Who kidnapped her before we did? That day we feared that you handed us over to rowdies... ...but only after you left we came to know... ...that they belonged to your uncle's department. You are studying to be a doctor... ...in spite of being in so many problems. I am ashamed to stand in front of you, Ganesh. When this girl came to our college... ...some goons were searching here. That's why I brought her here secretively. My men will be all around this place. No one can come here. Ask me for any help you want. Thanks a lot for your help. This is my problem. I'll handle it by my own. Come. Let's go. You are facing all this only because you saved me. After that incident in Madurai I wanted to meet you... ...but that didn't happen. And then when I saw you... ...in the bus-stand again I couldn't control myself and... I don't know why I did so. I think I love you. - Look! I am not in a position to love anyone. Eeshwar's brothers have mistaken... ...that we are in love with each other. They are searching you to kill you before killing me. Don't roam outside for a few days. Stay at your friend's place. Let's go. 'You saved me without knowing who I am.' 'And now can you ignore me after knowing that I love you!' "Forget everything!" "Cross all the limits." "Shoot me with kisses." "Cuddle me." "Caress me." "Arrest me with your looks." "I came here to hijack your beauty." "You have already stolen my heart." "O girl, I will make you dance to my tunes." "I'll play with you." "O girl, I will make you dance to my tunes." "I'll play with you." "Cuddle me." "Caress me." "Arrest me with your looks." "Forget everything!" "Cross all the limits." "Shoot me with kisses." "My heart caught fever for you." "I'll give you the warmth of my body." "Imprison me in your arms." "Lend me yourself." "I surrender myself to you." "What a beauty!" "Cuddle me." "Caress me." "Arrest me with your looks." "You are killing me with your beauty." "You have the rights over me." "You make me cross the lines." "You're the one who does that to me." "What's there to hesitate now! Come into my arms." "Serve me." "Forget everything!" "Cross all the limits." "Forget everything!" "Cross all the limits." "Cuddle me." "Caress me." "Arrest me with your looks." "Forget everything!" "Cross all the limits." "Shoot me with kisses." Why don't you let others walk freely? Move aside, you ugly faces. What does that pose mean! I see. So you are karate-kids! Girls, please put your legs down. I didn't mean it, please carry on. We will remove your top. - Forget about my top... ...and think about your top first. Get lost. I wonder how their parents are bearing them. Madam, my head is spinning. Give me a soda. I would give you a soda even if you don't ask me for one. Your voice is very sweet. - OK, and do you want... ...a girl's soda or a boy's soda. Is there a specific soda for boys and a specific soda for girls? The one with balls is men's soda... ...and the one without balls is women's soda. So there are different kinds of sodas as well. OK, give me one for me. - Which one? The one with the balls. - Here it is. - Open the seal. Are you married? - No. Why? I can guess that. She opened it with her thumb. Give me a fruit. - Orange, pomegranate or jack-fruit. Which one? - Give me a banana. - I see. She looks like an enemy. Give it in my hands. Why did you throw it on me. Are you doing business or are you doing rowdyism? Are you a woman? You are messing with me. Even the rowdies are scared of me. And today you want to mess with me. Don't forget that you are talking to a warden. - Warden! Here's the warden. Call everyone. Why are you beating me? - The wardens used to beat us... ...in the jail in the same way. - Jail. You are beating me assuming that I am a jail-warden. - Yes. I am a hostel warden. - We don't know that. We can't bear any warden. Bash him up. OK, let's meet later on. Bye. - Bye. 'I'll test Ganesh if he loves me or not.' Hello. - It's me, Amala speaking. - Yes. I came to Global tower to attend a seminar. I told you to stay at your friend's place. Forget it. There's some shocking news. The person who tried to kill me is right here. I'll tell him that I love you. - Hey! Hello! Hello! Hello! Brother, he'll come out only if we kill her. Won't you listen to me. No matter whenever you come... ...this is what your fate will be. Cowards like you can't harm me. Hold my hand. Listen to me, come up. If I accept my life as alms from you... ...I will be betraying my brother and my sister. O brother! Brother! The person whom we wanted to kill is still alive. He's killing one by one in our family. Where is he? Where is he! Oh my God! - What happened, sir? Pedda Reddy escaped from the jail. He kidnapped Amala and asked Ganesh to come there. Ganesh is going there in full anger. We have to stop him before he reaches there... ...and fights with him. Lift the phone, Ganesh. Lift the phone. Hey! It's our brother. Brother Pedda Reddy. Where is that girl! You should regret till the end of your life... ...that you didn't marry my sister. - Where is she? No girl who wants to marry you should be alive. That was my sister's last wish. If I can't fulfill her wish I am not Eeshwari's brother. Listen to me. I have got nothing to do with her. Does it hurt? Does it really hurt! Now I am telling you. Now I am confessing it. I love this girl. I will marry this girl. If you have guts dare to touch her. Come forward. Come forward. Dare to touch her. Dare to touch here. Touch her. Touch her. This is the hand which broke my father's led, right. This is the leg which kicked her, right. Why? Why do you want to die for the sake of revenge? - No! Leave him. Don't you understand what I say! Do you know something! When I heard that... ...your sister died, I'm the one who grieved most. More than all of you. I wanted your sister to become a woman... ...but I never wanted her to die. Why was your brother so arrogant! I tried my best to save his life, but he wanted his death. You say you want to kill us. Do you know what the value of life is? If these students here think the way you think... ...then none of you will stay alive. We are studying to save people's lives. We know what the value of life is. Only God can give or take one's life. None of the humans have that power. I can kill you right now, but that's not what I want. Learn to live like a human being. Ganesh. - Yes. You said that you love me. Is it a lie? Hello. - Ganesh, don't harm Pedda Reddy. He won't mess with us anymore. And one more thing. Come to the place where my parents are. I'm coming there with the girl I am about to marry. OK, I'll arrange for your marriage. - No. No Not now. I'll get married only after I become a doctor.
