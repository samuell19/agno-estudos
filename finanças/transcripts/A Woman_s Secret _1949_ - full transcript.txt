AND SO, UNTIL NEXT WEEK AT THE SAME TIME, ON THE SAME STATION, REMEMBER - HEAR ESTRELLITA TONIGHT AND GO TO SLEEP WITH LOVE IN YOUR HEART. ? LITTLE STAR ? ? YOU SEE ME SAD AND LONELY ? ? PLEASE LISTEN TO MY PLEA ? ? MY LOVE IS GONE FROM ME ? ? GENTLE STAR ? ? WILL HE RETURN ? ? AND TENDERLY WHISPER ? ? "DEAREST ONE, I LOVE YOU SO ? ? MY HEART IS YOURS ALONE"? ? ? AND GUIDE HIM BACK ? ? TO ME ? YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE SONGS OF ESTRELLITA. THIS IS - HELLO. HELLO. THE SHOW WAS GREAT TONIGHT, SUSAN. NO ONE WOULD EVER GUESS THE NEW INTRODUCTION WAS REALLY GOING TO BE A COMMERCIAL. SURE. MY HAVING TO KNOCK MYSELF OUT LATER, RUSHING THROUGH ESTRELLITA TO FINISH ON TIME, DOESN'T MATTER, JUST AS L- OH, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? HUNGRY? MOLLIE'S BEEN WAITING UP. NO, I'M NOT HUNGRY. I WAS JUST ASKING. THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK OVER WITH YOU, ONLY I DON'T MEAN "TALK OVER." I MEAN TELL YOU. I'VE NOTICED THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND EVER SINCE YOU GOT BACK FROM NEW ORLEANS. I'M GLAD YOU FEEL LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT. IT MAY HELP YOU. I DON'T WANT ANY HELP, AND I DON'T INTEND TO TALK IT OVER. IT'S JUST SOMETHING I'VE DECIDED TO TELL YOU. AND I'M GOING TELL YOU. I'M TIRED. I'M TIRED OF EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY, AND I'M THROUGH. I'M THROUGH FOR GOOD! I'M GLAD YOU'VE DECIDED TO TAKE A REST, SUSAN. YOU'VE BEEN WORKING MUCH TOO HARD. WE CAN GO AWAY SOMEPLACE. YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING? YOU'RE THE BIGGEST FOOL I EVER MET. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, AND YET YOU'RE TRYING - YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP, SUSAN. YOU'RE VERY TIRED. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE? I DON'T THINK I KNOW EVERYTHING BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. BECAUSE YOU DON'T. JUST BECAUSE YOU AND MR. LUKE JORDAN - OH, IS THAT WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU, SUSAN? I DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO LUKE JORDAN, AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY I SHOULD. HE DOESN'T OWE ME A SINGLE THING, NOT ANYTHING AT ALL. OH, BUT I DO, DON'T I? YOU MADE ME WHAT I AM TODAY, DIDN'T YOU? WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU DID. I'D HAVE BEEN ESTRELLITA OR SOMETHING ELSE, PROBABLY SOMETHING A WHOLE LOT GREATER, IF I'D NEVER MET YOU. I'M SURE YOU WOULD. AND SUPPOSE YOU DID MAKE ME ESTRELLITA, ONLY KEEP RIGHT ON SUPPOSING. SUPPOSE TOMORROW MORNING, THERE WASN'T ANY ESTRELLITA. SUPPOSE I FINALLY DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ALL BY MYSELF. SUPPOSE I - STOP IT, SUSAN! SUSAN? MISS SUSAN? MISS SUSAN? COME IN, MOLLIE. I THOUGHT I HEARD A SHOT. WHY, WHAT HAPPENED? MY GOD. DID MISS CALDWELL TRY TO - THIS IS MISS WASHBURN. CAN I SPEAK TO DR. FERRIS, PLEASE? SHOULDN'T WE BE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING, MISS MARIAN? I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING, MOLLIE. YES, MISS MARIAN. HELLO, DR. FERRIS. THIS IS MARIAN WASHBURN. THERE'S - MISS CALDWELL HAS JUST BEEN SHOT. CAN YOU COME RIGHT UP? WE'RE ON THE 18th FLOOR, YOU KNOW. NO, I WON'T TOUCH A THING. I PROMISE. THANK YOU. THE DOCTOR WILL BE UP IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? HOW COULD - HAVE THE DOCTOR COME UP AS SOON AS HE GETS HERE. YES, MISS MARIAN. WELL? WELL, SHE'S STILL ALIVE. WE HAVE TO GET HER TO A HOSPITAL AT ONCE. EL DORADO 59098. WHAT HAPPENED? THIS IS AN EMERGENCY, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE AN OFFICIAL REPORT. IT'S MY DUTY. HELLO. THIS IS DR. FERRIS. SEND AN AMBULANCE TO 880 PARK AVENUE RIGHT AWAY. MISS WASHBURN'S APARTMENT. THANK YOU. ISN'T THERE SOMETHING YOU COULD DO RIGHT AWAY? I'M NOT SURE THAT EVEN AT THE HOSPITAL. THE BULLET IS VERY CLOSE TO HER HEART. THIS IS MISS WASHBURN. WILL YOU PLEASE GET ME POLICE HEADQUARTERS? I'M LIEUTENANT BENSON. MISS WASHBURN! WHAT'S HAPPENED? THERE'S BEEN A SHOOTING. I DID IT. YOU'LL FIND HER IN HER ROOM UPSTAIRS. THERE'S A DOCTOR WITH HER. TAKE A LOOK. RIGHT. IT WAS RIGHT AFTER SHE CAME HOME FROM HER BROADCAST AND - WHO? MISS CALDWELL - ESTRELLITA, THE RADIO SINGER. SUSAN CALDWELL IS HER REAL NAME. TONIGHT WHEN SHE CAME HOME, WE STOPPED - LOOK, LADY, I'VE GOT TO WARN AND ADVISE YOU - ANYTHING YOU MAY SAY CAN BE HELD AGAINST YOU. I HAVE NOTHING TO CONCEAL. I NEVER KNEW IT TO FAIL. RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENS, YOU CAN'T SHUT THEM UP. THREE DAYS LATER, THEY GET A LAWYER, AND YOU CAN'T GET A WORD OUT OF THEM WITHOUT A 10-TON TRUCK AND A BENCH WARRANT. LIEUTENANT? DOC SAYS SHE'S GOT TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY, A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH - PROBABLY DEATH. OKAY. I'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOU TO THE POLICE STATION, MISS WASHBURN. I'M READY. I JUST HAVE TO GET MY COAT. ALL RIGHT. SOMETIMES THEY GOT A BATHROOM WHERE THEY GO FOR THE COAT. AND THEY GET AN IDEA ABOUT SOME KIND OF POISON OR A RAZOR, MAYBE. MIND IF I GO WITH YOU? NOT AT ALL. HELLO, INSPECTOR. MISS WASHBURN? YES, I'M MISS WASHBURN. MOLLIE, WILL YOU GET MY COAT, PLEASE? I'M INSPECTOR FOWLER. WHAT'S THE DOPE, HARRY? SHE WAS JUST GOING TO TELL ME - SAID SHE SHOT A WOMAN, NAME OF CALDWELL. THE DOCTOR'S UP THERE WITH HER NOW. SHE'S BREATHING, BUT, UH, IT LOOKS PRETTY SERIOUS. OH. AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE, I'LL GO UP AND GIVE FITZ A HAND, HUH? RIGHT. AM I UNDER ARREST? YOU'LL HAVE TO COME TO THE POLICE STATION. YOU'LL BE BOOKED... PROBABLY ON A CHARGE OF FELONIOUS ASSAULT. OF COURSE, IF MISS CALDWELL SHOULD DIE, THE CHARGE IS HOMICIDE. YOU'LL BE ALLOWED TO MAKE THREE CALLS FROM THE STATION HOUSE. THE OFFICER IN CHARGE AND MYSELF WILL MAKE THEM FOR YOU. ONE WILL BE TO YOUR LAWYER, OF COURSE. YOU CAN START MAKING UP YOUR MIND NOW WHO YOU WANT TO CALL FOR THE OTHER TWO. I DON'T WANT A LAWYER. MISS WASHBURN... WE BETTER BE GETTING ALONG. YOU'RE THE DOCTOR. NO, THE INSPECTOR. THAT'S NOT FUNNY. IT NEVER IS WHEN THERE'S BEEN A SHOOTING. I ALWAYS FIGURE IF THE LORD WANTED YOU TO HAVE A BULLET IN YOU, YOU'D HAVE BEEN BORN WITH ONE. ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO CALL YOUR LAWYER? NO, JUST THE ONE CALL. I ALWAYS TURN PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT THIS TIME OF NIGHT. LIEUTENANT, HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHETHER PEOPLE ARE TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT? IT'S VERY SIMPLE, THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. TO ME, THE MINUTE ANYBODY'S ARRESTED, FROM THEN ON, HE'S A LIAR, UNLESS HE'S PLEADING GUILTY, OF COURSE. WELL, SHE'S PLEADING GUILTY. GIVE ME THE PHONE. YEAH. COME. COME, NOW, MR. JORDAN. YOU DON'T REALLY MEAN TO TELL US THAT YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY THE PASSAGE? I CAN IDENTIFY IT, BUT I'VE DECIDED TO WAIT 'CAUSE I'VE FOUND OUT EVERY TIME I IDENTIFY ANYTHING RIGHT AWAY, MR. HARRIS AND MR. PIERSON HERE SAY THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MUSIC IS, HAVE YOU, MR. HARRIS? GENTLEMEN? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY - NO IDEA. ME TOO. THAT'S BETTER. IT'S FROM ACT ONE OF WAGNER'S "DIE WALKURE." IT'S THE ORCHESTRAL PASSAGE IN THE MIDDLE SECTION OF SIEGMUND'S LOVE SONG. CORRECT. HOW DO YOU DO IT, MR. JORDAN? I DON'T KNOW. GENIUS, WOULD YOU SAY? OH, I MIGHT NOT, BUT, UH, YOU WOULD, WOULDN'T YOU? MM, JUST TO THROW PEOPLE OFF THE TRACK, PERHAPS. TONIGHT OUR BOARD OF EXPERTS HAS HELD OUR LOSSES TO TWO SNAPPER-LENS CAMERAS AND TWO MADALGO PROJECTORS. NEXT WEEK AT THE SAME TIME, IN ADDITION TO OUR REGULAR EXPERTS - MR. HARRIS AND MR. PIERSON - WE WILL AGAIN HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING AS OUR GUEST MR. LUKE JORDAN, CELEBRATED COMPOSER, CONCERT PIANIST, WIT, AND, UH, ALL-AROUND GADFLY. WHAT'S THE MATTER, TOMMY? YOU'RE TO CALL THIS NUMBER, MR. JORDAN - VERY IMPORTANT, THEY SAID. IT'S A POLICE STATION, A MANHATTAN EAST PRECINCT. WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW? HERE, HERE. LOOK, MISTER, IT'S NOT GONNA GET YOU ANYPLACE AT ALL TO CARRY ON LIKE THIS. YOU CAN'T SEE MISS WASHBURN, AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. WHAT'S THE IDEA OF LETTING ME KNOW WHERE SHE IS AND NOT LETTING ME SEE HER? ANSWER ME THAT. IF I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE OUT OF YOUR MIND, I'D LOCK YOU UP. THAT'S AN IDEA. LOCK ME UP. YOU'RE WAY OFF YOUR BASE, SMARTY-PANTS. THERE'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT TIER AND A WHOLE DIFFERENT WING FOR THE WOMEN PRISONERS. HERE! OKAY. GIVE HIM HIS NUMBER, CHARLIE. PORT WASHINGTON 8721. HELLO, MATTHEWS? OH, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO MR. MATTHEWS, PLEASE. I DON'T CARE WHETHER HE'S RETIRED. THIS IS LUKE JORDAN. I'VE GOT TO TALK TO MR. MATTHEWS. NEVER MIND YOUR ORDERS. WAKE HIM UP. HE'LL TALK TO ME. I TELL YOU, I'VE GOT TO TALK TO MR. MATTHEWS! THEY HUNG UP. WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING TONIGHT, DO YOU? WHERE CAN I PICK UP A CAB? OUT IN THE STREET, VERY LIKELY. WE USED TO HAVE QUITE A COLLECTION RIGHT IN HERE, ALL READY FOR PASSENGERS, BUT WE CUT IT OUT. GOT IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS. I WARN YOU, MR. JORDAN, I SHALL BE COMPELLED TO SEND FOR THE POLICE. MR. MATTHEWS IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED. HE LEFT STRICT ORDERS THERE WERE TO BE NO EXCEPTIONS. THERE'S ALREADY BEEN AN EXCEPTION. I'M IT. MR. JORDAN, SIR, I'M AN OLD MAN. BUT I INTEND TO DO MY BEST TO PREVENT YOU FROM - IT'S ALL RIGHT, HAROLD. I'M COMING DOWN. I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU LIKE THIS, BROOK, BUT IT'S TERRIBLY IMPORTANT. IT BETTER BE. YOU CAN GO TO BED NOW, HAROLD. THANK YOU, MR. MATTHEWS. WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT, LUKE? I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THIS SOME OTHER WAY, BUT I CAN'T. SUSAN WAS SHOT TONIGHT. SUSAN WAS - WHAT'S THAT? I WENT OVER TO THE POLICE STATION, BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH I COULD FIND OUT. THEY'VE LOCKED UP MARIAN. MARIAN? SHE SAYS SHE TRIED TO KILL SUSAN. I CALLED YOU RIGHT AWAY, BUT THAT BIRDBRAIN OF A BUTLER - NEVER MIND THAT. NOW, WHAT ABOUT SUSAN? YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO BREAK IT GENTLY, ARE YOU? SHE'S NOT - SHE'S NOT DEAD? NO, BUT THERE'S NO TELLING. NOBODY'S ALLOWED TO SEE HER. UH, HELP YOURSELF. MARIAN'S BEING VERY STUBBORN - SAYS SHE DOESN'T WANT A LAWYER. THAT'S WHY I CAME OUT HERE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE HER LAWYER. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, YOU'LL LET THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE KNOW THAT YOU'RE HANDLING THE CASE. I SEE NO REASON FOR ME ANY LONGER TO BE INVOLVED WITH SUSAN OR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO HER. IN MY BOOK, WHEN A MAN ASKS A WOMAN TO MARRY HIM, THAT SORT OF GETS HIM INVOLVED WITH THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO HER. NO? SINCE YOU SEEM DETERMINED TO ARGUE THE MATTER, SUPPOSE I TELL YOU THAT SUSAN LET ME KNOW THE DAY AFTER SHE GOT BACK FROM NEW ORLEANS THAT SHE DECIDED NOT TO MARRY ME. I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN. BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST LAWYERS IN NEW YORK, AND YOU'RE GOING TO REPRESENT MARIAN. AS LONG AS MOTHER WAS ALIVE, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO MARRY SUSAN. AND I'M BEGINNING TO THINK NOW THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO MARRY ME, EVEN IF MOTHER HADN'T - IT'S COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR ME TO ALLOW MYSELF TO GET MIXED UP IN THIS MATTER IN ANY MANNER. YOU'RE GONNA BE MIXED UP IN IT, ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU STILL HAVE A CHOICE AS TO WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE MARIAN'S LAWYER, WHICH IS NATURAL ENOUGH, YOUR BEING AN OLD FRIEND OF HERS AND OF SUSAN'S, OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE SUMMONED BY THE PROSECUTION AS A WITNESS. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THEY ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE SUCH CLOSE FRIENDS. I WAS ALWAYS SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE WHAT AN ODD FRIENDSHIP THAT WAS. MARIAN'S REGULAR AND GENUINE AND, WELL, A LOT OF THINGS THAT SUSAN JUST ISN'T. THAT'S ALL RIGHT TO SAY, ISN'T IT? YOU DID SAY YOU WERE THROUGH WITH HER, DIDN'T YOU? WELL, THAT'S NO REASON FOR BEING SO - SO REALISTIC ABOUT SUSAN. "REALISTIC'S" THE WORD FOR SUSAN, ALL RIGHT. JUST SO I'VE PERSUADED YOU TO REPRESENT MARIAN. THANKS A LOT. I'M GONNA GET SOME SLEEP. YOU BETTER DO THE SAME. WAIT A MINUTE. I'LL LET YOU OUT. LOOK, WHY DO YOU THINK MARIAN WOULD TELL THE POLICE THAT SHE TRIED TO KILL SUSAN? WELL, FOR ONE THING, MAYBE BECAUSE SHE DID TRY TO KILL SUSAN. COULD BE... EXCEPT FOR ONE OTHER THING - COULDN'T BE, NOT A CHANCE IN THE WORLD. I'M SURE YOU REALIZE, MR. MATTHEWS, THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO OPPOSE BAIL FOR MISS WASHBURN IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. SHE'S NOT GONNA RUN AWAY. YOU KNOW THAT. I ALSO KNOW WE'RE APT TO HAVE A PHONE CALL ANY MOMENT THAT CAN CHANGE THIS CHARGE TO HOMICIDE. IT'S ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE HOLDING HER ON A SHORT AFFIDAVIT THAT I'VE CONSENTED TO THE PRESENCE OF MR. JORDAN AT THIS MEETING. I RECOGNIZE YOUR COURTESY, BELIEVE ME. I DARESAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME, YOU'D BE APPLYING LIGHTED CIGARETTES TO THE BOTTOM OF HER FEET. PLEASE TAKE IT EASY, LUKE. MISS WASHBURN, MR. MATTHEWS SAYS YOU'VE DECIDED TO GIVE US YOUR VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED. THAT IS NOT EXACTLY CORRECT. I'VE ADVISED MISS WASHBURN TO MAKE NO STATEMENT OF ANY KIND. IT IS DECIDEDLY NOT IN HER INTERESTS. SHALL I GO AHEAD, MR. ROBERTS? PLEASE. SUSAN GOT BACK TO THE APARTMENT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS USUAL AFTER HER BROADCAST LAST NIGHT, AND... WELL, WE GOT INTO A BIT OF AN ARGUMENT. ABOUT WHAT? MARIAN, I ADVISE YOU AGAIN YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND TO ANSWER ANY OF MR. ROBERTS' QUESTIONS. SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO QUIT FOR GOOD. THEN SHE WENT UP TO HER ROOM. IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO MAKE UP MY MIND TO TELL HER EXACTLY HOW THINGS STOOD. I SAW NO REASON TO TAKE ANY MORE OF HER NONSENSE... SUSAN? I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. MARIAN, I'M SORRY IF I UPSET YOU. WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW AND - WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW, AND I WANT YOU TO GET THIS STRAIGHT ONCE AND FOR ALL - YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP YOUR CAREER. MARIAN, I'M NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY TO TALK ABOUT MY GIVING UP MY CAREER. I'M JUST TIRED, AND I WANT TO QUIT - YOU'RE NOT GOING TO QUIT. YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND - YOU'RE NOT JUST YOURSELF ALONE. YOU'RE ME, TOO. MARIAN, I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU AND LUKE - THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SO HARD FOR ME TO - I- I'D HAVE GIVEN UP BEING ESTRELLITA LONG AGO, GOTTEN MARRIED, MAYBE, OR I GUESS PROBABLY GONE BACK TO SELLING PERFUMES AT NORMAN'S. IT'S BECAUSE I AM SO OBLIG- EVERYTHING I HAVE OR EVER HAD OR EVER COULD HAVE HAD WENT INTO CREATING YOU. YOU'RE MYSELF, THE WAY I COULD HAVE BEEN, THE WAY I WANTED TO BE. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME IF YOU QUIT? BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GIVING UP MY LIFE, AND IT IS MY LIFE JUST AS MUCH AS IT'S YOURS. AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GIVE IT UP. I'M SORRY, MARIAN. I'VE MADE UP MY MIND. I REALLY AM QUITTING. YOU'RE NOT. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR ME TO DO. YOU SEE, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT YOUR LIFE BEING MY LIFE. THAT'S EXACTLY IT. I'VE NEVER HAD A LIFE OF MY OWN. IT'S TIME I STARTED ONE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. I'M WARNING YOU FOR THE LAST TIME. I'M SORRY, MARIAN! MAYBE I CAN MAKE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND. AAH! MOLLIE HEARD THE SHOT. THEN SHE CAME RUSHING IN. I CALLED DR. FERRIS, AND THEN I CALLED THE POLICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MISS WASHBURN. YOU SEE, SHE WAS - SHE WAS ME. I COULDN'T LET HER QUIT. VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD STORY. EXCEPT THAT IT'S COMPLETE NONSENSE FROM BEGINNING TO END, IF I'M ALLOWED TO EXPRESS AN OPINION, MR. ROBERTS, BEGGING YOUR HIGHNESS'S PARDON, MR. ROBERTS. MISS WASHBURN, WHERE'D YOU GET THAT REVOLVER? IT'S A GERMAN LUGER. WHEN I WAS IN FRANCE IN 1944 WITH SUSAN, I - A SOLDIER INSISTED UPON GIVING IT TO ME AS A SOUVENIR. AND THAT SOLDIER - OF COURSE, HE HAD A NAME. I NEVER KNEW HIS NAME. IT WAS AT A CANTEEN. I PLAYED GIN RUMMY WITH HIM. IT'S THE LAST I EVER SAW OF HIM. YOU'VE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, MR. MATTHEWS, THIS IS MISS WASHBURN'S STORY. IT'S A MATTER OF RECORD AND GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THAT MISS WASHBURN POSSESSED A VOICE OF CONSIDERABLE QUALITY HERSELF AT ONE TIME. SHE WAS BECOMING VERY SUCCESSFUL WHEN SHE LOST THAT VOICE. THEN SHE MET MISS CALDWELL, HELPED HER, HELPED HER A GREAT DEAL. BUT WHEN IT TURNED OUT THAT MISS CALDWELL WAS UNGRATEFUL - I DIDN'T SAY SHE WAS UNGRATEFUL. IT'S JUST THAT SHE WANTED TO STOP BEING A SINGER. AND ALL YOU WANTED WAS TO STOP HER FROM STOPPING. I WOULDN'T LET HER. I COULDN'T. IT WOULD'VE BEEN SUICIDE - MY SUICIDE. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? MARIAN, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE? WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE TRUTH, WHATEVER IT IS? I AM TELLING THE TRUTH. I'M GOING DOWNTOWN NOW. MAY I DROP YOU ANYPLACE, MR. MATTHEWS? I HAVEN'T FINISHED TALKING TO MISS WASHBURN. MARIAN, WON'T YOU - LUKE, WILL YOU STOP IT? WE BETTER GO, MR. JORDAN. WHEN MATTHEWS FINISHES WITH MISS WASHBURN, HAVE THE MATRON PUT HER BACK IN HER CELL. YES, INSPECTOR. AND TAKE THAT ICE OFF HER FINGERS. SHE DIDN'T DROP IN FOR TEA. SHE'S UNDER ARREST. INSPECTOR, DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION? YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS CASE, BUT COULDN'T YOU SENSE THAT THAT STORY WASN'T ON THE LEVEL? I DID THINK IT WAS A LITTLE PAT. BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW OFTEN THE TRUTH IS... PAT. OUTSIDE OF THAT, WHEN YOU'VE BEEN ON THE POLICE FORCE AS LONG AS I HAVE, YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO DO MUCH SENSING. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT INTUITION. BUT I WAS WATCHING YOU WHILE SHE WAS TELLING HER STORY, AND I COULD TELL THAT YOU WERE A LITTLE BEWILDERED. THE PERSON AND THE STORY JUST DON'T FIT. YOU CAN FEEL THAT, CAN'T YOU? SHE DID LOSE ME AT TIMES. ESTRELLITA DON'T LIVE HER OWN LIFE. SHE LIVES MISS WASHBURN'S, TOO. MISS WASHBURN WANTED TO STOP HER FROM COMMITTING SUICIDE TO SAVE HER LIFE - MISS WASHBURN, I MEAN. SO SHE SHOT HER - NOT HERSELF, BUT ESTRELLITA, IN THIS CASE - BECAUSE... I'LL ADMIT, MISTER, THAT I'VE HEARD STORIES THAT MAKE LESS SENSE THAN THAT, AND YET THEY HAPPEN TO BE TRUE. YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR LUNCH, INSPECTOR? EATING. HOW ABOUT HAVING LUNCH AT THE DIRECT EXPENSE OF A TAXPAYER? I WANT TO TALK. I'D LIKE A CHANCE TO SHOW SOMEONE THAT - THAT MARIAN JUST COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. I PROMISE TO EAT SLOW. I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO BE A LITTLE HONEST WITH YOU, JORDAN. THE WAY THINGS ARE, IT'S NOT GONNA BE HARD FOR ROBERTS TO SHOW A JURY WHY MISS WASHBURN - HE'LL SIMPLY POINT OUT SHE WAS AFRAID SHE'D LOSE HER MEAL TICKET. THAT'S A FEAR MOST PEOPLE RECOGNIZE BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT IT THEMSELVES. MARIAN NEVER LOOKED ON SUSAN AS A MEAL TICKET. COULD BE. BUT A MEAL TICKET DON'T HAVE TO BE LOOKED ON AS A MEAL TICKET... TO BE A MEAL TICKET. YOU SEE, I'VE KNOWN MARIAN FOR A LONG TIME. WE KIND OF STARTED OUT TOGETHER. I MEAN, I WAS A PIANO PLAYER AND A SONG PLUGGER, AND THERE WAS THIS LITTLE PLACE DOWN IN THE VILLAGE WHERE I USED TO PLAY FOR MY MEALS IN A ROOM, BACK OF THE KITCHEN. MARIAN USED TO SING THERE. ?... LET HIM TARRY ? ? LET HIM SINK OR LET HIM SWIM ? ? HE DOESN'T CARE FOR ME ? ? NOR I DON'T CARE FOR HIM ? ? HE CAN GO AND GET ANOTHER ? ? THAT I HOPE HE WILL ENJOY ? ? FOR I'M GOING TO MARRY ? ? A FAR NICER BOY ? ? HE CAN GO TO HIS OLD MOTHER ? ? AND SET HER MIND AT EASE ? ? I HEAR SHE IS A CROSS OLD WOMAN ? ? VERY HARD TO PLEASE ? ? IT'S SLIGHTING ME AND TALKING ILL ? ? IS WHAT SHE'S ALWAYS DONE ? ? BECAUSE I WAS COURTING ? ? HER GREAT BIG UGLY SON ? ? LET HIM GO, LET HIM TARRY ? ? LET HIM SINK OR LET HIM SWIM ? ? HE DOESN'T CARE FOR ME ? ? NOR I DON'T CARE FOR HIM ? ? HE CAN GO AND GET ANOTHER ? ? THAT I HOPE HE WILL ENJOY ? ? FOR I'M GOING TO MARRY ? ? A FAR NICER BOY ? EAT? THAT'S WHY I WAS SINGING. THAT'S WHY I WAS PLAYING. YOU KNOW, ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'RE GONNA BE SINGING THAT SONG ON BROADWAY, AND I'M GONNA BE WALKING UP AND DOWN OUTSIDE THE THEATER. PICKETING? NO, I JUST WON'T HAVE ENOUGH DOUGH TO BUY A TICKET. OH, THAT'LL BE EASY TO FIX. I'LL JUST LET YOU SIT AND WAIT IN MY DRESSING ROOM, AND THEN - WELL, THEN MAYBE I'LL LET YOU GET RID OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO'LL BE WAITING OUTSIDE TO GET MY AUTOGRAPH. "OUT OF THE WAY, PEOPLE. MAKE WAY FOR MISS WASHBURN." THEN MAYBE I'LL LET YOU PINCH ME SO I'LL WAKE UP. OW! NOTHING LIKE A GOOD REHEARSAL. YOU GOT A LITTLE MORE TIME? AS LONG AS THEY DON'T RUN OUT OF COFFEE. MISS? BRING SOME MORE COFFEE, AND KEEP ON BRINGING COFFEE. YES, SIR. MARIAN NEVER GOT TO BE A STAR, BUT SHE WAS GONNA BE ONE, NO QUESTION OF IT. SHE'D BEEN FEATURED IN A COUPLE OF MUSICALS, AND SHE WASN'T MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO AWAY. AND I KNOW WHAT I - SORRY. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I USED TO PLAY THE PIANO FOR HER A LOT - REHEARSALS AND BENEFITS AND THAT SORT OF THING. THEN SUDDENLY, ONE NIGHT - WHAT HAPPENED? I WAS IN HER DRESSING ROOM. LIE DOWN, MARIAN. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'LL GET A DOCTOR. TRY TO GET DOC CALVIN. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT HAPPENED? HELLO, LUKE. I WAS ALMOST FINISHED MY NUMBER, AND - YOU'RE NOT TO TALK. SHE SUDDENLY LOST HER VOICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND CHORUS. I DIDN'T REALLY LOSE MY VOICE. MARIAN! IT JUST DIDN'T SOUND LIKE HER VOICE. IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN. SHE PROBABLY NEEDS A NICE REST. I'VE GOT THE QUEEREST FEELING. MARIAN. SHE MUSTN'T TALK. YOU KEEP QUIET. THAT MEANS YOU DON'T SAY A WORD. UNDERSTAND? WHEN YOU GET YOUR VOICE BACK, YOU CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT. I UNDERSTAND. I'M BEING VERY SILLY, HUH? YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD, AND I'LL SLUG YOU. YOU'RE SWEET. 5 WILL GET YOU 10 YOU DON'T EVEN MISS TOMORROW NIGHT'S SHOW. BUT SHE DID MISS THE NEXT NIGHT'S SHOW. WELL, THEY FOOLED AROUND FOR A WHILE WITH AN UNDERSTUDY, BUT THEY FINALLY HAD TO CLOSE. THAT'S HOW GOOD SHE WAS. WHAT WAS THE MATTER? TO BEGIN WITH, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST PLAIN LARYNGITIS. THEN THEY FOUND OUT IT WAS SOME RARE TYPE OF LARYNGITIS NONE OF THE DOCTORS KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT. PRETTY GRIM. GOOD COFFEE. IT WAS MONTHS BEFORE THEY ALLOWED HER TO USE HER VOICE AT ALL, AND THEN I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR LATER SHE STARTED IN SINGING AGAIN, PRIVATELY. FINALLY ONE DAY SHE WENT AROUND TO PAUL CAMELLI - HER TEACHER'S STUDIO - TO GET A PROFESSIONAL OPINION. HE WAS THE BEST THERE WAS. SHE KNEW HE'D GIVE IT TO HER STRAIGHT. WELL, WHAT ABOUT IT? WHAT ABOUT IT, PAUL? YOU TELL ME. ? I'M JUST A WOMAN THAT LOVED A MAN ? ? BUT OUR HOUSE OF LOVE WAS BUILT ON SAND ? ? WHILE IT LASTED, AH, IT WAS GRAND ? OKAY, PAUL, THAT'S THE WAY I USED TO SING. TURN IT OFF! THERE'S REALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR VOICE NOW - EXCEPT THAT THERE'S JUST NO VOICE. COME ON, LUKE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO KEEP ON WORKING, I COULD CLEAR A LITTLE TIME TUESDAYS AND FRIDAYS. NO, THANK YOU. JUST A MINUTE. WHAT IS IT, LUKE? WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR? I THOUGHT I'D FEEL BETTER. I DO, TOO. BE SEEING YOU, PROFESSOR. DON'T TAKE ANY FAKE GRACE NOTES. YOU CAN STILL GET A LOT OF PARTS. NOT THE KIND OF PARTS I WANT. I WANT TO SING. IF I CAN'T SING THE WAY I WANT TO, EVEN THE WAY I USED TO, I - I JUST DON'T WANT TO SING AT ALL. I... THERE ARE OTHER THINGS. LIKE WHAT? I COULD OPEN UP A BOOKSHOP OR A HAT STORE OR... I COULD GET MARRIED. YOU SURE COULD. REMIND ME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT VERY SUBJECT ANY DAY NOW. YOU'RE PROPOSING TO ME? NO. AFRAID I'LL ACCEPT? AFRAID YOU WON'T. NOW THAT WE KNOW WE'RE BOTH SAFE, HOW ABOUT COMING HOME WITH ME AND HAVING DINNER AT MY PLACE? GLAD TO, ONLY I'VE GOT TO STOP IN THE REHEARSAL HALL FOR ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR, TRY OUT SOME PEOPLE. WANT TO COME ALONG? SURE. I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HADN'T PERSUADED MARIAN TO DROP IN AT THAT REHEARSAL FOR A FEW MINUTES. ANYWAY, THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT WE WERE GONNA RUN INTO WHEN WE LEFT AFTER ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR OF ME HELPING TO TRY OUT A LOT OF TALENT THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY. OHH! LUKE, SHE'S FAINTED. LOOKS LIKE. HELLO. I WON A BET. THEY DON'T SAY, "WHERE AM I?" LUKE. YOU THINK I FAINTED? H- HERE, LET ME HELP YOU. YOU BETTER SIT DOWN OVER HERE AND REST A BIT. MARIBEL - MY GIRLFRIEND OVER IN HANDBAGS - SHE TOLD ME THIS WOULD HAPPEN - A PERSON NOT EATING FOR WEEKS, ONLY A CUP OF COFFEE IN THE MORNING. WHAT? JUST NOW I DID A TAP-DANCE FOR MR. ARCHER. GUESS THAT DID IT - NO STRENGTH. HE SAID I COULDN'T DANCE GOOD ENOUGH, TOO. TRYING OUT FOR THE SHOW, WERE YOU? I WORK AT NORMAN'S - PERFUMES. LUKE, WOULD YOU GET A CAB, PLEASE? DON'T I ALWAYS? I CAN'T REMEMBER EVER EATING TWO PLATES OF SOUP BEFORE - I MEAN AT THE SAME MEAL, OF COURSE. YOU CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR MIND IF YOU'D RATHER HAVE A GLASS OF MILK. NO, THANKS. THIS IS WHAT I'D LIKE IF I HAD AN APARTMENT - AN IMITATION FIREPLACE WITH A GAS LOG. MAKES THINGS HOMEY. OH, UH, SUSIE, DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION? NO, GO RIGHT AHEAD. WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BACK THERE IN THE REHEARSAL HALL ABOUT NOT EATING FOR WEEKS, JUST COFFEE IN THE MORNING - WHAT'S THE IDEA, A DIET? AN ELECTION BET? NO MONEY. DON'T THEY PAY YOU PRETTY WELL AT NORMAN'S? WELL, I THINK SO. IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, LUKE. MAYBE SHE'S SENDING MONEY HOME. OH, IT'S NOT THAT. EVER SINCE I CAME TO NEW YORK, I'VE BEEN FIXING TO GO TO THIS FORTUNE TELLER I HEARD ABOUT, ONE OF THE BEST - $100 A VISIT. WHAT? SO I SAVED UP. HOW WAS I TO KNOW HE REALLY CAN'T TELL MUCH IN LESS THAN THREE VISITS? YOU'RE ON YOUR FEET ALL DAY AT A PERFUME COUNTER. YOU GO WITHOUT FOOD FOR WEEKS TO PAY A FORTUNE TELLER $100 A VISIT? WELL, THERE'S NO SENSE GOING UNLESS YOU GO TO THE BEST. YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT EVER SINCE YOU CAME TO NEW YORK. WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? AZUSA. AZUSA, CALIFORNIA. AZUSA? IT'S KIND OF A MADE-UP WORD, DIFFERENT LETTERS. THEY PUT THEM TOGETHER. THAT'S HOW THEY GOT THE NAME. EVERYTHING FROM "A" TO "Z," U- S-A - AZUSA. I STILL DON'T GET IT. WHAT DOES THE U-S-A STAND FOR? UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. OH. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO COME TO NEW YORK? I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD GET A JOB IN A NEW YORK SHOW, BUT, WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I GOT IN KIND OF A LITTLE SCANDAL BACK IN AZUSA, SO WHEN MRS. BRIGELL OFFERED ME THIS MONEY TO COME TO NEW YORK, I GRABBED IT. OH, A LITTLE SCANDAL. WELL, SUSIE, TELL US ALL ABOUT IT. OH, THERE WASN'T MUCH TO IT. ALL MRS. BRIGELL WANTED WAS TO GET ME OUT OF AZUSA AND AWAY FROM THAT CRAZY HUSBAND OF HERS. OH, THAT WAS ALL, HUH? WELL, I FIGURED SHE WAS OUT OF HER MIND, BUT IT WAS HER MONEY. AS IF I'D HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH A MAN TWICE MY AGE. WHY, HE WAS 36 IF HE WAS A DAY. I THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST JOKING WHEN SHE SAID HE'D ASKED HER FOR A DIVORCE. WOULDN'T YOU? WELL, I - MM-HMM. YOU SEE, WHEN YOU'RE WORKING AT A CAF?, YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOME REGULAR CUSTOMERS THAT DROP IN FOR LAUGHS. HOW WAS I TO KNOW THAT MR. BRIGELL WOULD TURN AROUND AND TELL MRS. BRIGELL HE WANTED A DIVORCE? YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD THE NOISE IT MADE IN AZUSA. MR. BRIGELL'S ABOUT THE RICHEST MAN THERE, YOU KNOW - SMUDGE POTS AND PEST CONTROL. IT'S GOT TO BE TRUE. NOBODY COULD INVENT THAT. SMUDGE POTS AND PEST CONTROL. NOW, LUKE, YOU'RE NOT BEING THE LEAST BIT FUNNY. OH, HE DON'T BOTHER ME. YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART, AND I BET YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND. THERE WASN'T EVER A THING IN THE WORLD BETWEEN ME AND MR. BRIGELL. I APOLOGIZE. APOLOGY ACCEPTED, AND NO OFFENSE TAKEN, I'M SURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, I'M SURE. GLADLY. I DON'T WANT TO BE SELLING PERFUME ALL MY LIFE. NOW I DON'T SEE WHAT ELSE - I DIDN'T EVEN ASK MR. ARCHER TO LISTEN TO ME SING - FOR THE CHORUS, YOU KNOW - 'CAUSE IF I COULD BE THAT WRONG ABOUT MY DANCING - YOU SING, TOO? I JUST TOLD YOU - PROBABLY AWFUL. DON'T YOU KNOW? I THOUGHT I KNEW, BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO LOOK AT THINGS IN NEW YORK THE WAY THEY DO IN AZUSA. HOW ABOUT SINGING US A LITTLE SONG? I CAN PLAY THE PIANO PRETTY WELL. I'LL ACCOMPANY YOU. ANYTHING POPULAR YOU'D LIKE TO SING, I'D PROBABLY PLAY IT FOR YOU. YOU KNOW "PARADISE"? "PARADISE." I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED. IT JUST HAPPENS I DO. I THINK I'LL TAKE A LITTLE WATER FIRST. IT CLEARS YOUR THROAT, YOU KNOW. ALL CLEAR? WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. ? I'M JUST A WOMAN THAT LOVED A MAN ? ? BUT OUR HOUSE OF LOVE WAS BUILT ON SAND ? ? WHILE IT LASTED, AH, IT WAS GRAND ? ? MY LOVE ? ? WE LIVED AND LOVED, OUR DAY IS THROUGH ? ? BUT EACH NIGHT IN DREAMS IT'S STARTED ANEW ? ? HE COMES TO ME LIKE HE USED TO DO ? ? MY LOVE ? ? AND THEN HE HOLDS MY HAND ? ? MM-MMM MM-MMM-MMM ? ? AND THEN I UNDERSTAND ? ? MM-MMM MM-MMM-MMM ? ? HIS EYES AFIRE ? ? WITH ONE DESIRE ? ? THEN A HEAVENLY KISS ? ? COULD I RESIST? ? ? AND THEN HE DIMS THE LIGHT ? ? MM-MMM MM-MMM-MMM ? ? AND THEN HE HOLDS ME TIGHT ? ? MM-MMM MM-MMM-MMM ? ? EACH KISS, EACH FOND CARESS ? ? WILL LEAD THE WAY TO HAPPINESS ? ? HE TAKES ME ? ? TO PARADISE ? THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SHE JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE VOICES. OF COURSE, THE RANGE WASN'T MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE NOTES, GIVE OR TAKE A NOTE. BUT THEY WERE THE SORT THAT GO DOWN YOUR SPINE AND DIRECTLY INTO YOUR HEART. I KNOW THAT'S QUITE A DETOUR, BUT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING YOU MIGHT SAY SHE HAD A - WELL, SHE JUST HAD A VOICE WITH HORMONES. YEAH? AND MARIAN KNEW RIGHT FROM THE START THAT HERE WAS A VOICE SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. THAT'S ALL IT MEANT TO HER. THAT'S WHY IT JUST DOESN'T FIT, HER CARING ANYTHING ABOUT THE MONEY OR BEING JEALOUS OF SUSAN'S SUCCESS. SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN JEALOUS OF SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES MISS CALDWELL'S SUCCESS. YOU MEAN JEALOUS OF ME? WELL, TO TELL THE TRUTH, I THINK SHE WAS ONCE OR TWICE. BUT SHE WAS WRONG. THIS MISS CALDWELL'S ROOM? THAT'S RIGHT. I'M LUKE JORDAN. I'M AN OLD FRIEND OF MISS CALDWELL'S. THEY TOLD ME AT THE DESK THAT NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO, BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE IF I TALKED TO YOU AND TOLD YOU HOW IMPORTANT IT IS, YOU'D LET ME LOOK IN FOR JUST A SECOND. NOT A CHANCE. WHAT'S HER CONDITION? SHE'S BEEN SHOT. I KNOW THAT. SO, THAT'S HER CONDITION. THANKS. THERE'S NO ONE ALLOWED TO HANG AROUND HERE. THE WAITING ROOM IS DOWN THE HALL. THERE'S ANOTHER FRIEND OF HERS THERE. CUP OF TEA, OFFICER? OKAY, A CUP OF TEA - THAT'S THE WORST THING ABOUT THESE JOBS. HEY, CHIEF, THAT ROOM MARKED "WAITING ROOM" - IS THAT THE WAITING ROOM? I BEG YOUR PARDON. I'M LUKE JORDAN. THEY TOLD ME A FRIEND OF MISS CALDWELL'S WAS WAITING IN HERE. DO YOU KNOW HER? I KNOW HER. WHAT ABOUT IT? WELL, I THOUGHT I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW. SEEMS LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW THEM ALL, HUH? HAVE THEY TOLD YOU ANYTHING ABOUT HER CONDITION? I'M WAITING TO SEE THE DOCTOR MYSELF. AND IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HER, I'M GONNA MAKE IT MY OWN PERSONAL BUSINESS TO STAY HERE IN NEW YORK UNTIL THEY SEND THAT MISS MARIAN WASHBURN TO THE ELECTRIC CHAIR. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE SHE DID IT? ARE YOU CRAZY? DON'T YOU READ THE PAPERS? SHE CONFESSED, DIDN'T SHE? WHO ELSE COULD HAVE DONE IT? YOU KNOW MISS WASHBURN? MET HER IN FRANCE SAME TIME I MET SUSAN, AT A CANTEEN. AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, SUSAN CAME DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS TO ENTERTAIN THE THIRD ARMY REUNION, AND I SAW HER AGAIN. SO, YOU'RE THE SOLDIER SHE MET AT THE CANTEEN. ANY OBJECTIONS? THE GUY THAT GOES AROUND GIVING AWAY LUGERS AS SOUVENIRS. I LIBERATED THAT LUGER. AND IF I WANTED TO GIVE IT TO HER, THAT'S MY BUSINESS. YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF ALL WORKED UP FOR NO REASON AT ALL, MISTER, UH - WHAT'D YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS? LEE CRENSHAW. AND I DON'T AIM TO TELL YOU THAT MORE THAN ONCE. WHAT DO YOU GOT AGAINST MARIAN? ISN'T SHOOTING SUSAN ENOUGH? I HOPE THEY HANG HER! I GOT A NOTION, MR. CRENSHAW, THAT BEFORE YOU LEAVE NEW YORK I'M GONNA POKE YOU IN THE NOSE. ANYTIME. A LITTLE LESS NOISE, PLEASE. THIS IS A HOSPITAL. YEAH, I'M SORRY, NURSE. I'LL BE SEEING YOU, MR. CRENSHAW. ANYTIME. WEST 49th STREET, BETWEEN 8th AND 9th AVENUES. NOT ON YOUR DAY OFF. A COP DON'T HAVE A DAY OFF. WELL, HIS WIFE OUGHT TO. GOT YOUR SHOES OFF, HMM? HMM? I KIND OF HAD AN IDEA THAT - LET'S HAVE IT. WHY AREN'T WE GOING TO THE MOVIES TONIGHT? WELL, A MR. LUKE JORDAN CALLED AND SAID HE'D LIKE TO SEE ME. SO, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO INVITE HIM TO STAY FOR DINNER. IT'S ABOUT ESTRELLITA, THE ONE ON THE RADIO. PRETTY NEAR GOT HERSELF KILLED LAST NIGHT. I READ THE PAPERS. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE GOT A HUSBAND WHO KNOWS ALL THE TOP SECRETS, I CAN STILL READ THE PAPERS. GOT IT ALL SOLVED? MM-HMM. IT'S YOUR MR. LUKE JORDAN. REALLY? WHY? WELL, IT COULDN'T BE MARIAN WASHBURN. WHY NOT? JIM! OH, I FORGOT. SHE CONFESSED, DIDN'T SHE? THAT AUTOMATICALLY ELIMINATES HER, ACCORDING TO THOSE DETECTIVE STORIES YOU READ, DOESN'T IT? ONLY... WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT WASN'T THE BUTLER? THEY DIDN'T HAVE A BUTLER. HMM. BRIGHT GIRL. IT'S THE DOORBELL. I KNOW IT'S THE DOORBELL. ...CARS. CALLING ALL CARS. I'M LUKE JORDAN. OH, COME IN. I'M MRS. FOWLER. HELLO, JORDAN. WELL, HELLO, INSPECTOR. I'M SORRY TO BREAK IN ON A QUIET AFTERNOON LIKE THIS, MRS. FOWLER, BUT WHEN I CALLED THE INSPECTOR'S OFFICE - THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT. THIS IS SIMPLY AN EXTRA OFFICE FOR THE INSPECTOR, BUT WITH ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME. THEY DON'T LET HIM WALK AROUND HEADQUARTERS IN HIS STOCKING FEET, YOU KNOW. MRS. FOWLER NEVER SEEMS TO REALIZE THAT CRIME GOES ON 24 HOURS A DAY. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, THAT'S WHAT MY MOTHER TOLD ME ABOUT MARRIAGE, ONLY I FOUND OUT IT WASN'T SO. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN, MR. JORDAN? THANK YOU. OH, UH, ABOUT YOUR MR. LEE CRENSHAW - HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT LEE CRENSHAW? WHY DO YOU THINK WE KEEP A POLICEMAN OUTSIDE HER DOOR? ANYBODY INQUIRING, WE CHECK. BORN IN A LITTLE PLACE ABOUT 60 MILES FROM NEW ORLEANS - LAFITTE PARISH. HAD AN EXCELLENT WAR RECORD. BEEN WORKING IN A SPORTING-GOOD SHOP SINCE HE GOT BACK FROM THE WAR. THAT'S WHAT THE INSPECTOR FOUND OUT JUST ON HIS DAY OFF, WITHOUT LEAVING HOME. CARRIER PIGEON. BY THE WAY, YOU'RE STAYING FOR DINNER, IF YOU LIKE. I'D LIKE VERY MUCH. I'VE TOLD YOU, I'M GONNA KEEP ON TALKING ABOUT THIS UNTIL WE STUMBLE ON SOMETHING OR OTHER THAT WILL CLEAR IT UP. I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THE DETECTIVE WORK WAS STUMBLING. HOW COME YOU TO CATCH ON? WHY DON'T YOU START IN WHERE YOU LEFT OFF AT LUNCH? AT LUNCH? WE HAD LUNCH TOGETHER. HE TOLD ME HOW HE AND MISS WASHBURN MET ESTRELLITA. OH, HE DID, DID HE? ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEN YOU GOT HOME YOU RAN OUT OF SMALL TALK AWFULLY QUICK. PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE LUNCH, FOR ALL YOU SAID TO THE CONTRARY - NOTHING EXCEPT HOW HOT IT WAS DOWNTOWN AND... HOW HOT IT WAS DOWNTOWN. MM. GO AHEAD, JORDAN. YEAH. WE'LL, I'VE NEVER KNOWN ANYBODY WORK HARDER THAN MARIAN DID, TRYING TO MAKE A STAR OUT OF SUSAN. FOR ONE THING, SHE HAD TO HAVE ALL THE AMBITION FOR BOTH OF THEM. OH, SUSAN WAS WILLING, AND IT WASN'T HARD TO TAKE THE NOTION SHE WAS GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL AND FAMOUS. BUT SHE NEVER TIED IT UP WITH ANYTHING SHE HAD TO DO ABOUT IT. THAT'S HOW I BECAME INVOLVED MORE THAN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN. SUSAN - OR ESTRELLITA, THAT IS - SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU. IS THAT IT? NO, NO. SUSAN NEVER FELL IN LOVE WITH ANYBODY - EXCEPT SUSAN. WHAT I MEANT WAS THAT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING SUSAN HAD TO BE - WELL, SHE HAD TO BE KIND OF COURTED. YOU HAD TO REMIND HER EVERY SECOND THAT SHE WAS GONNA BE A GREAT STAR. SHE'D KEEP ON COMPLAINING THERE SHE WAS WORKING HARD ALL DAY AT NORMAN'S. NORMAN'S? YEAH, SHE USED TO SELL PERFUMES THERE, YOU KNOW. NO, I DIDN'T KNOW. IT WAS IN THE PAPERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO, IT GOT TO BE MY ASSIGNMENT TO SPEND NEARLY EVERY MINUTE OF HER SPARE TIME WITH HER, BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T, SHE'D START MAKING FRIENDS ON HER OWN THAT TOOK UP SO MUCH OF HER TIME, THERE WAS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE SHE WOULDN'T SHOW UP FOR THE LESSONS MARIAN HAD ARRANGED - AND NOT JUST VOICE, NO, NO. MARIAN HAD TO SHOW HER WHAT TO WEAR, HOW TO WALK, WHAT TO SAY, WHAT NOT TO SAY. THAT CAN BE PRETTY IMPORTANT, KNOWING WHAT NOT TO SAY. I'LL SAY. SO, IT DIDN'T REALLY BREAK MY HEART WHEN MARIAN DECIDED TO TAKE SUSAN OFF TO PARIS. WHAT FOR? YOU DON'T NEED A "WHAT FOR?" TO GO TO PARIS. SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD GIVE HER A KIND OF VENEER THAT SHE NEEDED. I HEARD FROM MARIAN NOW AND THEN, AND THEN I DIDN'T HEAR. THEN I GOT A LETTER. SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT MY COMING TO PARIS, BUT I FELT I OUGHT TO, AS QUICK AS I COULD. SO, I GOT MYSELF A JOB ON A TRAMP STEAMER. THEY HAD WHAT RING LARDNER USED TO CALL A THREE-PIECE ORCHESTRA - PIANO, PIANO STOOL, AND PIANO PLAYER. I WAS THE PIANO PLAYER. AU REVOIR, MADAME. ENTREZ. LUKE! MAY I COME IN? OH, LUKE, I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. WHEN DID YOU GET HERE? ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. HOW DID YOU GET HERE? WALKED - I CAME AS SOON AS I GOT YOUR LETTER SAYING THAT YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT SUSAN, THAT I BETTER COME RIGHT OVER. I DIDN'T WRITE YOU THAT I WANTED YOU TO COME RIGHT OVER. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T. SO, THIS IS PARIS... PARIS, FRANCE. OR THAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT SUSAN. NO, BUT YOU DID WRITE ME TWO LONG LETTERS IN A ROW ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFUL THE CHESTNUT TREES WERE AND THE CHAMPS ELYS?ES AND THE PUNCH-AND-JUDY SHOWS AND THE KIDS IN THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS AND THE LIGHTS ON THE BRIDGES AT NIGHT. AND YOU NEVER SAID ONE WORD ABOUT SUSAN. SO I KNEW. WHATEVER IT IS, IT CAN'T BE YOUR FAULT. DON'T YOU REALIZE WHAT WE'VE DONE... WHAT I'VE DONE? I'VE CHANGED THE WHOLE COURSE OF HER LIFE. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY THE WAY THINGS WERE. SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE BACK HOME. TO AZUSA? OH, YOU MUSTN'T EVER TAKE PEOPLE AND TRY TO MAKE THEM SOMETHING THEY'RE NOT, SOMETHING TO SUIT YOURSELF, SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO BE, PRETEND THEY'RE MARIONETTES, CONTROL THEM BY WIRES. THEN THEY STOP HAVING A LIFE OF THEIR OWN. NOW I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR HER AS LONG AS SHE LIVES, LUKE. WELL, I COULD ARGUE THAT. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT REALLY HAPPENED? WELL... I HAVEN'T SEEN HER FOR - IT'LL BE SIX WEEKS TOMORROW. DID YOU HAVE A FIGHT? NO. JUST THAT, ONE DAY, SHE MET A MAN. THIS ONE SOLD BATA SHOES TO THE ARABS IN MARRAKECH, AND HE - HE PUT IDEAS INTO HER HEAD. FOR INSTANCE? HE RECOMMENDED HER TO THE MANAGER OF A LITTLE OPERA COMPANY WHO WAS JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR NORTH AFRICA. SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ALL THIS STUDY, SO... SHE LEFT. WHERE IS SHE NOW? OH, SOME LITTLE PLACE IN ALGIERS. I GOT A CARD FROM HER YESTERDAY. OHH, LUKE! AND ALL THE BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES I BOUGHT FOR HER, AND THEY WERE SO RIGHT, AND SHE LEFT THEM ALL BEHIND. SHE JUST TOOK WITH HER WHAT SHE WAS WEARING AND A RED CHIFFON DRESS SHE BOUGHT FOR HERSELF THE SECOND DAY WE WERE HERE. THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY MIND, ISN'T IT - THE RED CHIFFON, HER FOLLOWING HER OWN TASTE? IF YOU WANT TO KNOW, I THINK SHE'S BEEN RESENTING ME BECAUSE SHE MISSED YOU! I'VE TOLD YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT SUSAN DOESN'T MEAN A THING TO BE AT ALL! YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL! I DO HAVE TO YELL! YOU DON'T HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING IF I DON'T YELL! CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, LUKE. YOU DROPPED WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING IN NEW YORK - DIDN'T YOU? - AND CAME HERE BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE! ALL RIGHT. I DROPPED EVERYTHING AS SOON AS I FIGURED OUT THAT SUSAN WAS IN TROUBLE. LET ME HAVE THAT CARD. I'LL GO BRING HER BACK. I- I DIDN'T MEAN TO HOLLER AT YOU. I HOLLERED AT YOU. YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU? HERE. I IMAGINE THE SOONER YOU GO, THE BETTER. CAN'T I EVEN STAY IN PARIS LONG ENOUGH TO GET INTO A FIGHT WITH A WAITER? OH, LUKE... YOU HAVE THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY OF INVITING A GIRL TO DINNER. I HAVE, HAVEN'T I? YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I LIKE PARIS. YOU NEVER HAVE ANY TROUBLE FINDING SOMEBODY TO EAT WITH. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PUT ON MY JACKET AND MY HAT. A SHOE SALESMAN - AND I HAVE TO GO TO ALGIERS. BONJOUR, MONSIEUR. BONJOUR. OH, AMERICAN, MISTER? A TABLE FOR YOU? THANKS. WE'VE GOT AN AMERICAN BAR. ALL KINDS OF COCKTAILS - WHISKEY, SCOTCH TYPE, JUST LIKE AMERICANS LIKE. I'LL JUST HAVE A BEER NOW. SURE. BY THE WAY, I'M LOOKING FOR A FRIEND OF A MINE. A GIRL IS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE BY THE NAME OF SUSAN CALDWELL. SURE. CRAZY AMERICAN, KILLS ALL THE PEOPLE. I'LL GET HER. OH! LUKE! BRR! OH, LUKE, I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. AND I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU. RED CHIFFON, ALL RIGHT. WHAT? NOTHING. UH, OKAY. MARIAN GOT YOUR CARD. WELL, I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU GOT HERE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OPERA COMPANY? THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING. AFTER EVERYTHING THIS FELLOW TOLD ME, THERE WASN'T ANY OPERA COMPANY. HE WAS A LIAR. YOU DON'T SAY - NO OPERA COMPANY? WELL, WELL, WELL. THAT MR. LASALLE - HE WAS THE ONE THAT GAVE ME THE RECOMMEND TO THE OPERA COMPANY. THAT'S THE SAME FELLA THAT SOLD THE SHOES, HUH? WELL, HE WON'T BE SELLING ANYTHING FOR A LONG TIME. I NEARLY SCRATCHED HIS EYES OUT. AND A COUPLE OF THE OTHERS - THEY TRIED TO TALK TO ME, TOO. I NEARLY BROKE ONE OF THEIR ARMS. I MEAN, ONE OF THEM - I NEARLY BROKE HIS ARM, I MEAN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WELL, I KNEW IF I WROTE MARIAN, SHE'D GET ME BACK TO PARIS RIGHT AWAY. SO I DIDN'T WRITE RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE I THOUGHT FIRST I'D HAVE A VACATION. A VACATION FROM PARIS? THAT MARIAN, LUKE - YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA. WHAT ABOUT THAT MARIAN? SHE NEVER LET ME ALONE FOR A MINUTE. IT WAS BAD ENOUGH WHEN SHE HAD ME STUDYING FRENCH, BUT WHEN SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT ME STUDYING ENGLISH - WELL, YOU KNOW, LUKE, A PERSON CAN TAKE JUST SO MUCH. YEAH, A PERSON CERTAINLY CAN. WELL, IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU - OH, LUKE, YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE ME, WILL YOU? I MEAN, EVEN IF I GET TO BE SUCCESSFUL - PROMISE? I PROMISE. SO, LOOK, MARIAN'S ALL ALONE BACK THERE IN PARIS. I THINK IT WOULD BE JUST COMMON DECENCY FOR YOU TO - OH, I'LL BACK TO PARIS IF YOU SAY SO... BECAUSE AROUND HERE, IF I NEVER GET TO EAT ANOTHER RAW SHEEP AGAIN, I - OH, LUKE, I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME. I TAKE IT YOU MEAN THAT AS A COMPLIMENT, SO THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, LUKE, IT'S THE FUNNIEST THING - THE MINUTE THE SHIP LEAVES NEW YORK, EVERY PLACE YOU GET TO IS FULL OF FOREIGNERS. YOU DON'T SAY. MAKES IT TOUGH, DOESN'T IT? BUT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME. WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THAT PIANO PLAYER, IF YOU'LL PARDON THE EXPRESSION. 5 WILL GET YOU 10 HE'S TRYING TO PLAY "ESTRELLITA." WHAT'S THAT? HUH? WHAT'S "ESTRELLITA"? OH, YEAH, I FORGOT ABOUT YOU. MAYBE IF YOU HEAR IT PLAYED RIGHT, YOU'LL RECOGNIZE IT. EXCUSE ME. THANK YOU. ?... TENDERLY WHISPER ? ? "DEAREST ONE, I LOVE YOU SO ? ? MY HEART IS YOURS ALONE"? ? ? OH, LANTERN OF LIGHT ? ? IN THE BLUE ABOVE ? ? KEEP BURNING FOR ME ? ? WITH THE FLAME OF LOVE ? ? TILL YOUR LIGHT ? ? WITH DAWN BECOMES AN ARROW ? ? TELL HIM OF MY LOVE ? ? OH, GENTLE STAR ? ? AND GUIDE HIM BACK ? ? TO ME ? AND THAT WINDS UP AS GOOD A SHIP'S CONCERT AS I'VE EVER HEARD. DON'T YOU AGREE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? SURE, YOU DO! MOTHER, WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME A MOMENT? WELL, BY ALL MEANS, BROOK. EVEN ON BOARD SHIP, YOU KNOW, IT'S A HABIT BROOK CAN'T GET AWAY FROM. HE HAS TO GO BACKSTAGE. I BEG YOUR PARDON, MISS WASHBURN. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU REMEMBER ME, BUT A FEW YEARS AGO, I REPRESENTED A CLIENT WHO HAD INVESTED IN A SHOW YOU WERE IN, AND I HAD THE PLEASURE - OF COURSE. YOU'RE MR. MATTHEWS. THIS IS MISS CALDWELL AND MR. JORDAN. MR. MATTHEWS. HOW DO YOU DO? UH, WON'T YOU SIT DOWN? UH, CHAIR, PLEASE. I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I ENJOYED YOUR SINGING JUST NOW. THANK YOU. UH, THANK YOU. THEY SAY THAT CONFESSION'S GOOD FOR THE SOUL, MR. MATTHEWS. I THINK I MIGHT AS WELL CONFESS. LUKE, ARE - ARE YOU SURE? THE FACT IS THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN HOPING WE COULD EXPECT YOU. I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR BEING CONFUSED. YOU SEE, WE'RE A GROUP OF CONSPIRATORS, AND YOU'RE OUR INTENDED VICTIM, THOUGH REALLY WE FEEL WE'LL BE DOING YOU A FAVOR. I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SO YOUNG, MR. MATTHEWS, AND YOU A DISTINGUISHED LAWYER AND A SCION OF AN OLD FAMILY, WELL, AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU SEE, MISS CALDWELL'S OUR PROT?G?, AND, WELL, IT'S ALMOST 100% TRUE THAT WE CHOSE THIS BOAT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO HEAR SUSAN SING IN THE SHIP'S CONCERT - OF COURSE, THE PLOT'S BEEN CHANGED A LITTLE BIT NOW. YOU SEE, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO OVER TO YOUR TABLE IN A LITTLE WHILE AND SAY, "MR. MATTHEWS, I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU REMEMBER ME, "BUT SOME YEARS AGO, I WAS IN A SHOW THAT WAS BACKED BY ONE OF YOUR CLIENTS." OH, DEAR. WELL, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY HAPPIER AUSPICES UNDER WHICH I COULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO BE THE, UH - UH, WHAT IS THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR? "SUCKER"? OH! WELL, FRANKLY, THIS IS ONE RUSE I HEARTILY APPROVE OF. OF COURSE, I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WAS NECESSARY - YOU TRY TO BE ONE OF A THOUSAND AMBITIOUS SINGERS ATTEMPTING TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH ANYBODY IMPORTANT. OH, I DON'T THINK I'M AS IMPORTANT AS ALL THAT. YOUR FIRM JUST HANDLES THE ESTATE THAT OWNS HALLAWAY'S HILLSIDE INN, THAT'S ALL. YOU'LL FIND SUSAN JUST AN ARTIST, PURE AND SIMPLE - ABSOLUTELY NO EYE FOR BUSINESS. YOU SEE, WE THOUGHT THAT IF YOU LIKED HER, SHE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET HER PROFESSIONAL START SINGING THERE. WE DO HAPPEN TO REPRESENT THEM. WELL THE ONLY QUESTION STILL OPEN IS WHOSE NAME WILL BE IN BIGGER LIGHTS - HALLAWAY'S OR ESTRELLITA'S? I'M SO GLAD YOU LIKE SUSAN, MRS. MATTHEWS. WELL, I MUST CONFESS I CAN'T REMEMBER EVER MEETING ANYBODY QUITE LIKE HER BEFORE. SHE'S - WELL, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING THIS. SHE'S SOMEWHAT OF A DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? SHE'S REALLY WONDERFUL, AND SHE'S WORKED SO HARD. YOU KNOW, EVEN A NATURAL VOICE LIKE HERS REQUIRES HOURS AND DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS OF SIMPLE DRUDGERY TO PERFECT. WELL, MY SON TRULY SEEMS TO HAVE A REAL GIFT FOR RECOGNIZING THEATRICAL TALENT. ACTUALLY, THERE ARE ALREADY QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO HE HAS, WELL, DISCOVERED, IN A SENSE, AND HELPED ALONG. I TRY TO ENCOURAGE HIM IN THIS ACTIVITY. IT GIVES HIM AN INTEREST THAT I LIKE. WHEN IT DOESN'T BECOME TOO SERIOUS. SUSAN WON'T BE A PROBLEM OF ANY KIND, MRS. MATTHEWS. I'LL SEE TO THAT. WELL, I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN HURT THE MOST PROMISING SONGWRITER OF TOMORROW - THAT'S ME - IF HE WERE TO GET MARRIED TO AN IMPORTANT MUSICAL-COMEDY ACTRESS, DO YOU? I THINK IT WOULD BE AN IDEAL ARRANGEMENT. MM-HMM. IT CERTAINLY WOULD. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. I THINK I'LL GO TO BED, BROOK. OH, OF COURSE, MOTHER. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, MRS. MATTHEWS. GOOD NIGHT. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. GOOD NIGHT. MOTHER. GOOD NIGHT. WELL, YOU'RE DOING ALL RIGHT. I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO. UH, COULD I HAVE THE NEXT DANCE, MISS CALDWELL? SURE. DO YOU MIND? NO, NOT AT ALL. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU INTENDED TO MARRY SUSAN. WHO SAID I DID? YOU DID. HUH? THAT'S RIGHT. I DID, DIDN'T I? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? NOTHING - NOTHING AT ALL. WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING, BUT I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA WH- OH, IT CAN'T BE THAT SILLY CRACK I MADE ABOUT INTENDING TO MARRY SUSAN? IT CERTAINLY CAN'T. THAT WAS JUST FOR MRS. MATTHEWS' BENEFIT. I KNOW. IT'S BEEN THE LONG STRAIN OF NOT BEING SURE. NOW AT ALL ONCE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT SUSAN'S GONNA MAKE THE GRADE. YOU'RE TIRED. THAT'S ALL. I AM. INDEED, I AM. GOOD NIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW, KNOWING MARIAN AND SUSAN A LITTLE BETTER? WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST PROVE THAT MISS WASHBURN'S A PRETTY NICE PERSON. AS FOR ESTRELLITA, NICE PEOPLE NOW AND THEN SHOOT OTHER PEOPLE WHO AREN'T NICE PEOPLE. REALLY, THEY DO. AND THEY GO TO JAIL FOR IT, TOO. JUST A MINUTE, MOLLIE. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A SECRET PASSAGE IN THE APARTMENT, WOULD YOU? NO, I DON'T, MRS. FOWLER. WELL, I GUESS I'VE CASED ABOUT ALL YOU CAN CASE ON THE FIRST VISIT. THAT'S TO ELIMINATE FINGERPRINTS. IS THAT A FACT? NOW, NOBODY'S TO KNOW I'VE BEEN HERE. I MAY TELL MYSELF, BUT ONLY AT THE PROPER TIME - MY TIME. YES, MRS. FOWLER. HERE'S YOUR MICROSCOPE... MAGNIFYING GLASS. ...AND YOUR FINGERPRINT-DUSTING POWDER, AND, UH - OH, MY MELTED WAX. THANK YOU. IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN ON THE POLICE FORCE - WELL, I MEAN INSPECTOR FOWLER, IF YOU WANT TO GET TECHNICAL... HAVEN'T YOU A THEORY OF YOUR OWN, MOLLIE? SURE. I GOT A THEORY. MISS SUSAN DIDN'T DO IT. MISS MARIAN DIDN'T DO IT. NOBODY ELSE DIDN'T DO IT, EITHER. WELL, SOMEBODY DID IT. SO IT NARROWS DOWN NOW JUST TO THE ONE QUESTION - WHO? WHO DID IT? THAT'S JUST WHAT I KEEP THINKING, TOO. WELL, YOU'LL LET ME KNOW, WON'T YOU, WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT MISS SUSAN'S CONDITION? OH, AND WOULD YOU MAIL THIS FOR ME? DON'T NEED A STAMP. THEY PAY WHEN THEY GET IT BACK - THE HOTEL DOES. MISS SUSAN GAVE IT TO ME TO MAIL WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM NEW ORLEANS. NOW, DON'T FORGET, MOLLIE - THE INSPECTOR ISN'T TO KNOW ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT TESTS I MADE. OH, HE WON'T. NOT FROM ME, HE WON'T. AND THEY AREN'T EVEN THE LAST WORD IN SCIENTIFIC METHODS. WHY, IN LONDON OR PARIS - WELL, YOU MARK MY WORDS, MOLLIE - WHEN WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, WE'RE GOING TO FIND SOMEBODY INCREDIBLY CLEVER AT THE TOP. GOODBYE. INSPECTOR FOWLER? YES? THEY'LL BE TAKING MISS CALDWELL BACK TO HER ROOM SHORTLY. HOW IS SHE? THE DOCTOR SEEMS QUITE PLEASED. THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY REASON FOR HIM TO BE PLEASED OR DISPLEASED IF THAT CRAZY MARIAN WASHBURN - THAT'LL DO. SUSAN HAD A RIGHT TO QUIT IF SHE WANTED TO, AND NOBODY'S GONNA TELL ME THAT - YOU HEARD THE INSPECTOR. NO PICTURES TILL I SEE THE DOCTOR. HOW CAN ONE LITTLE PICTURE HURT ANYBODY? QUIET. HOW'S IT LOOK, DOC? I THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TALK TO HER LATER IN THE DAY. LATER IN THE DAY. THAT'LL BE FINE. REACH FOR THE SKY, PARTNER! HELLO. I'LL CALL YOU BACK. UH, I'LL CALL YOU BACK. HELLO. I JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. NOBODY JUST HAPPENS TO BE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD UNLESS YOU'RE A BONDSMAN. WHAT HAPPENED ABOUT ESTRELLITA? IT LOOKS GOOD. OF COURSE, YOU CAN'T TELL, THOUGH. OH, FINE - CAN'T TELL ME, YOU MEAN. WELL, AS I SAID, I JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I THOUGHT I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE ME TO LUNCH. I WASN'T FIGURING ON HAVING ANY LUNCH. MM-HMM. COME IN. SORRY ABOUT TAKING SO LONG, INSPECTOR, BUT I HAD TO WAIT. THEY HAD TO SEND OUT FOR THE ICE CREAM TO MAKE THE APPLE PIE APPLE PIE A LA MODE. AND MABEL JUST GAVE ME THIS MESSAGE FOR YOU. YOU CAN SET THE TRAY DOWN, YOUNG MAN. FIGURING ON NO LUNCH, EH? WHAT'S THE MESSAGE, FRED? UH, A FELLOW CALLED, NAME OF LUKE JORDAN - HAD TO HANG RIGHT UP BUT SAID IT WAS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT - SAYS FOR YOU TO COME TO THE FURNACE ROOM AT THE CENTRAL SOUTH HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY. WELL, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? OH, I'VE DECIDED TO GO, HAVE I? WHY, OF COURSE. I MAKE MORE DECISIONS. HELLO, INSPECTOR. HELLO, MR. JORDAN. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? I HAVE A MIND TO - TO HAVE YOU ARREST THIS FELLOW? WHAT FOR? OKAY. WELL, AFTER YOU LEFT THIS MORNING, WE BOTH WENT ALONG TO SEE THAT SUSAN GOT TO HER ROOM OKAY. FOR A HOSPITAL, THEY KEEP THEIR FURNACE ROOM AWFUL DUSTY, DON'T THEY? SO, WE GOT TO TALKING. HE WOULDN'T LEAVE ME ALONE. HE KEPT ASKING QUESTIONS. AND HE KEPT ANSWERING THEM, THE DOPE. TELL HIM WHAT YOU TOLD ME. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING I DIDN'T SAY BEFORE. ABOUT THE REVOLVER. SO, HE ASKED ME AGAIN IF I GAVE IT TO HER, AND I SAID, "SURE, I GAVE IT TO HER." HOW WAS I TO KNOW HE MEANT MARIAN WASHBURN BY "HER"? WHEN I SAID "HER," I- I MEANT SUSAN. SHE'S "HER," TOO. DID YOU GIVE MISS CALDWELL THAT REVOLVER? I MUST BE GOING NUTS. IT WAS IN THE PAPER, I TELL YOU. AND WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHO I GAVE IT TO? I LIBERATED IT. AND IF YOU THINK YOU CAN DO ANYTHING TO A G.I. WHO LIBERATES THINGS - THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THEN WHAT IS THE POINT? HE DOESN'T SEE IT EVEN YET. IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS YOU THINK, LUKE. THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL HIM. AS LONG AS SHE SHOT HER - AND SHE DID SHOOT HER - WHICH HER? IT'S NOT GONNA DO ANY GOOD IN HER PARTICULAR CASE. NOTHING'S GONNA DO HER ANY GOOD, PARTICULAR OR UNPARTICULAR. SHE'S GOING TO JAIL, FOR SURE. SHUT UP. YOU THINK YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT SUSAN BY 6:00? THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT THE CORRECT PHRASING OF THAT JOKE IS, "THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED." WE'RE GONNA TRY THIS AGAIN, MR. JORDAN. ANYTIME. YOU MAY COME IN NOW, GENTLEMEN. HELLO. HELLO, SUSAN. THIS GENTLEMAN IS MR. ROBERTS. HE'S THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY. MISS CALDWELL. IF YOU'D MAKE IT AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE. JUST BE A MINUTE, DOCTOR. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF THE 22nd, MISS CALDWELL? I MEAN, DO YOU REMEMBER AT ALL HOW YOU CAME TO WAKE UP TO FIND YOURSELF HERE IN THE HOSPITAL? I CAME HOME AFTER THE BROADCAST, AND I FINALLY MANAGED TO TELL MARIAN THAT - THAT'S MARIAN WASHBURN, YOU KNOW. YES, MISS CALDWELL. I TOLD MARIAN THAT I WASN'T CONTINUING WITH MY CAREER. WELL, MARIAN WENT INTO A RAGE, AND THEN SHE TRIED TO - TO - OH, I'M SO TIRED. I'M AFRAID THAT WILL HAVE TO BE ALL, GENTLEMEN. WE CAN RETURN LATER FOR THE DETAILS. MR. ROBERTS, I'D LIKE TO ASK THE DOCTOR A QUESTION, IF YOU DON'T MIND. GO RIGHT AHEAD. YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO MISS CALDWELL ABOUT THIS THING AT ALL, HAVE YOU? CERTAINLY NOT. HAS ANYONE ELSE? NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN IN OR OUT OF THAT ROOM. RIGHT, OFFICER? RIGHT, DOCTOR. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. I REALLY MUST BE ON MY WAY, MR. MATTHEWS. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. MR. MATTHEWS? YES? DID MISS CALDWELL HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY? DID SUSAN TELL THE TRUTH? SHE TOLD THE SAME STORY MARIAN DID. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S TIME YOU STARTED FACING THE FACTS, LUKE. YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T DO IT. WELL, I GUESS SO. BUT - BUT IF YOU'D HAVE HEARD WHAT SUSAN SAID - I'VE HEARD SUSAN A LOT OF TIMES. YOU JUS- GOOD NIGHT, INSPECTOR FOWLER. LUKE. COME UP THE HOUSE AND HAVE A BITE TO EAT. I'LL HAVE MARY CLEAN THAT COAT... IF YOU'RE THROUGH WITH FURNACES FOR THE DAY. YOU CAN'T TELL ME THEY CAN SEND AN INNOCENT PERSON TO JAIL. YOU'RE NOT INNOCENT IF A JURY SAYS YOU'RE GUILTY. HE ALWAYS SAYS THAT. IT'S ENOUGH TO DRIVE YOU CRAZY. THANK YOU. I'M GOING DOWN TO SEE MARIAN, AND I'M GONNA MAKE HER TELL THE TRUTH. THAT'S THE SPIRIT, AND WHILE YOU'RE OUT, I WONDER IF YOU'D MAIL THAT KEY FOR ME. WHAT'S THAT? IT'S A HOTEL KEY. JUST DROP IT IN THE MAILBOX. THEY PAY WHEN THEY GET IT BACK. I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON AS I'VE SEEN HER. WHAT'S THAT KEY? WHERE'S LAFITTE PARISH, LOUISIANA, JIM? LOUISIANA? WHY? WHAT ABOUT LAFITTE PARISH? ISN'T THAT WHERE CRENSHAW COMES FROM? YES. WHAT ABOUT LAFITTE PARISH? WELL, MISS WASHBURN'S MAID, MOLLIE - SHE'S MISS CALDWELL'S MAID, TOO - SHE GAVE IT TO ME TO MAIL. GAVE YOU WHAT TO MAIL? THE KEY, JIM - THE KEY. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, REMEMBER? IT SEEMS THERE WAS THIS MARIAN WASHBURN, ONLY SHE LOST HER VOICE. AND THEN SHE MET THIS GIRL FROM AZUSA - SUSAN CALDWELL. WELL, THAT IS, SHE AND LUKE JORDAN MET THIS GIRL. I'LL TELL YOU LATER WHO LUKE JORDAN IS. HOW DID THE MAID GET THE KEY? WELL, MISS CALDWELL GAVE IT TO HER TO MAIL WHEN SHE GOT BACK FROM NEW ORLEANS, ONLY MISS CALDWELL ISN'T THE ONE WHO LOST HER VOICE. SHE'S THE ONE - HOLD IT. LAFITTE'S 60 MILES NORTH - I WONDER, MRS. FOWLER - I WONDER IF I MAY BE PERMITTED TO USE MY OWN PHONE. STRICTLY BUSINESS, I ASSURE YOU. MY OFFICE. MY DOWNTOWN OFFICE, THAT IS. INSPECTOR FOWLER, PLEASE. YOU KNOW, I COULD GET YOU COMMITTED. YOU'RE INSPECTOR FOWLER. HELLO. INSPECTOR FOWLER. WHAT ABOUT THAT LOUISIANA CALL, MORGAN? WHAT?! KEEP ON TRYING. THEY GET A BUSY NUMBER IN LAFITTE. HOW COULD THERE BE A BUSY NUMBER IN LAFITTE? OH, COME IN. DON'T TELL ME YOU SAW MISS WASHBURN THIS QUICK. YOU KNOW THIS KEY OF YOURS? I WAS ABOUT TO DROP IT IN THE MAILBOX ON THE CORNER WHEN I LOOKED AT IT. I THINK I GOT THE SAME IDEA. SO I WENT INTO THE DRUGSTORE AND PHONED. AND THAT'S WHY THE LINE WAS BUSY. OH, YOU'RE BEING SILLY. YOU WEREN'T CALLING THE DRUGSTORE. I WAS CALLING THE SHERIFF IN LAFITTE, AND SO WAS HE. WEREN'T YOU, LUKE? WELL? I THINK YOU AND I HAVE A LITTLE VISIT TO MAKE, INSPECTOR. WE CERTAINLY HAVE. ME TOO. I'LL PHONE MATTHEWS AND TELL HIM TO MEET US. I'VE DONE THAT. YOU DON'T MIND IF MR. MATTHEWS JOINS US, DO YOU, MARY? WHY, NOT ALL. HAVE ALL YOUR FRIENDS, IF YOU LIKE. AHA! I KNEW IT. SOMEBODY READ HER THE PAPERS. THAT'S HOW SHE KNEW WHAT STORY TO TELL. AND IN THIS CASE, THAT SOMEBODY - I REPEAT, THAT SOMEBODY - THAT SOMEBODY IS THE NURSE. WELL, I-I NEVER THOUGHT - YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. I'LL TAKE OVER NOW, MARY, IF YOU DON'T MIND. NOW THAT I'VE CRACKED THE CASE. IS IT ALL RIGHT IF WE SPEND A FEW MORE MINUTES WITH MISS CALDWELL, DOCTOR? WELL, IF HELPING TO GET AT THE REAL FACTS WILL MAKE HER FEEL ANY BETTER, I THINK IT MIGHT BE VERY SOUND THERAPY. YOU SEE, P- THEY GAVE ME ALL THOSE PILLS TO SLEEP. AND WHEN I AWOKE AND - AND THE NURSE TOLD ME, WELL, I GUESS I JUST MUST HAVE TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING. ABOUT THIS REPORT WE GOT FROM LAFITTE PARISH. WHERE WAS I? IN LAFITTE PARISH, LOUISIANA, GETTING MARRIED TO MR. LEE CRENSHAW. SHE'S EXPLAINED THAT, LUKE. I KNOW WHAT LUKE MEANS, BROOK. I HAVE EXPLAINED IT. BUT EVEN I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT - NEVER. OH, I-IF ONLY YOU'D BEEN THERE THE WAY YOU ARE NOW, BROOK - THOSE TWO SAZERACS BEFORE DINNER AND THAT 20-YEAR-OLD RUM THEY MAKE RIGHT IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND MARIAN? WHAT HAPPENED?! GO AHEAD, SUSAN. YOU'RE RIGHT, BROOK. I'VE GOT TO TELL. I OWE IT TO... SOMEONE. THAT'S RIGHT - TO MARIAN. THEN I-I GUESS I WAS KIND OF - KIND OF OUT OF CONTROL AFTER I LEFT MARIAN IN THE LIVING ROOM. NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED, I SIMPLY COULDN'T GET MY BEING MARRIED TO LEE OUT OF MY MIND. HOW I EVER COULD - AND I WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH YOU, BROOK. I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE, PARTICULARLY ONCE I GOT TO MY ROOM. SUSAN? SUSAN? I'M TIRED. I KNOW. AND I'VE SAID EVERYTHING I WANT TO SAY. NOW, PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE. WHAT'S WRONG, SUSAN? IF WE TALK IT OVER, WHATEVER IT IS, YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND IT REALLY ISN'T AS IMPORTANT AS YOU THINK. YOU'LL PROBABLY JUST BE ABLE TO LAUGH IT OFF. THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T LAUGH OFF. IS IT ANYTHING I'VE DONE? I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE. VERY WELL - WE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE. SUSAN... I'M GOING DOWNSTAIRS TO GET A GLASS OF MILK. WOULD YOU LIKE ONE? NO, THANK YOU. ALL I WANT IS FOR YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE! I COULD DO WITH SOME SLEEP. I MUST LOOK TER- GET OUT OF HERE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS REVOLVER? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND! GET OUT OF HERE! GET OFF ME! GET OUT OF HERE! OHH! GIVE IT TO ME! WELL, I'VE HEARD ALL I NEED. I'LL GET AHOLD OF ROBERTS AND HAVE THE CHARGE WITHDRAWN, MISS WASHBURN RELEASED. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SEEM IMMODEST, BUT ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU'RE ALL VERY LUCKY THAT I TOOK AN INTEREST IN THIS CASE. AND THE NEXT TIME YOU FEEL LIKE READING TO A PATIENT, TRY THE ENCYCLOPEDIA. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US ALL OF THIS BEFORE? DIDN'T IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT MARIAN MIGHT - SHE EXPLAINED THAT, TOO, LUKE, AND YOU KNOW IT. WHEN THE NURSE READ SUSAN THE NEWSPAPERS, SHE KNEW MARIAN MUST HAVE SOME REASON FOR THE STORY SHE TOLD. AND SHE WAS JUST WAITING UNTIL SHE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE MARIAN BEFORE SHE DIVULGED WHAT HAD REALLY HAPPENED. OH. I APOLOGIZE, SUSAN. PLEASE FORGIVE ME. AND DON'T WORRY, SUSAN. PLEASE DON'T WORRY. THE WORST THAT'LL HAPPEN - THEY'LL PAY YOU $1,000 A WEEK MORE NEXT SEASON. COME ON, MARY. SO NICE TO HAVE MET YOU... MRS. CRENSHAW. THE NURSE WILL GIVE YOU SOME MEDICINE, MISS CALDWELL. A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, AND YOU'LL BE PERFECTLY OKAY IN THE MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DOCTOR. WELL, THEN, I- I GUESS - DON'T GO... NOT FOR A MOMENT, BROOK, PLEASE. WELL, I... DON'T KNOW. A FEW MINUTES WON'T MATTER. I'VE REALLY BEEN DREADFUL, HAVEN'T I, BROOK? EVERYTHING'S FINE. THANK YOU, LIEUTENANT. GOOD LUCK. I DON'T MEAN YOU, MR. JORDAN. YOU'VE BEEN A HEADACHE RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. YOU MAKE ME VERY HAPPY, LIEUTENANT. COME ON, YOU. OOH! NO CABS. DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M ALLERGIC TO CABS? DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET OFF WITHOUT A FEW WORDS FROM ME ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR, MISS WASHBURN, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY - NOT JUST SLAPHAPPY OR SLIGHTLY BALMY. YOU'RE CRAZY. CAB! THAT'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT CABS - YOU WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT. FINALLY, AN EMPTY ONE SHOWS UP, AND THERE'S SOMEBODY IN IT. MAY I TELL YOU SOMETHING, LUKE? I'VE BEEN ASKING YOU TO FOR DAYS. I'M NOT SURE I- I'M THE HEROINE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE MYSELF OUT TO BE, BECAUSE SOMETHING TELLS ME IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, I- I MIGHT HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH, FOR JAILS CAN BE VERY UNATTRACTIVE. UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO FINISH A NOVEL. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE DON'T TRY TO GET A CAB, WE JUST WALK, UP AND DOWN BOTH SIDES OF MADISON AVENUE, WINDOW-SHOPPING? NOW YOU'RE BEING CRAZY. GOOD GIRL. THAT WAS A TEST QUESTION. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ROMANTIC, WALKING UP AND DOWN MADISON AVENUE, WINDOW-SHOPPING, BUT IT'S NOT. YOU ONLY GET YOURSELF FALLEN ARCHES. CAB! COME ON - IN YOU GO. JUST A MINUTE, LUKE. LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT - WE WON'T STOP ANYWHERE FOR ANY REHEARSALS, RIGHT? RIGHT. AND IF WE SEE ANYBODY FAINT, SHE STAYS FAINTED, RIGHT? RIGHT. AND ANOTHER THING - THERE'S NO LAW AGAINST BEING ROMANTIC IN A CAB, IS THERE? ARE YOU PROPOSING TO ME? IN YOU GO. ONCE AROUND CENTRAL PARK, DRIVER... VERY SLOWLY.
