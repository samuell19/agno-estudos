[music playing] Stephanie? Stephanie, can you hear me? Oh. How are you feeling? Who are you? It's me, Grant. Oh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. [sighs] Where am I? We had an accident, Stephanie. We're in the hospital. [moans] Why are you calling me Stephanie? Because that's your name, honey. No. Not Stephanie. No. Not-- Don't try to talk anymore. Just relax. No, I'm not-- She's had a bit of a concussion. She'll be coming around soon. Here are the rest of the X-rays. NURSE [OVER INTERCOM]: Dr. Ingall. Calling Dr. Alan Ingall. It's been over an hour. Yes, I know. Is she all right? Well, it doesn't seem too serious, thank god. Thank you for coming down. But it's late. You should be going home. You've got school tomorrow. Well, are you all right? Oh, yeah, sure. I-- I'm indestructible. Grant, you're not Superman. You should try to take a few days rest. Howard can write that research report for you and give it to Chancellor Webster. Can't you, Harold? Really, I don't think I should do that. No, thanks, really. DOCTOR: Professor Roberts? - Hm? Yes? - I've checked those new X-rays. Excuse me. How are they? They're encouraging. Now, the right wrist is fractured, but it should mend perfectly. You can take your home any time. Great. But I want to see her in a few days to check that concussion, just to be safe. She's got some bad bruises. She's going to be black and blue for quite some time. Mm. Ah. I want to X-ray that wrist of hers in a couple of weeks, just to see how the healing is progressing. OK. Hopefully, in a month, she'll be as good as new. And that was pretty good, Doctor. Thank you very much. You take care of that back of yours too. Right. Mommy, we were so worried when Dad called. - Hey, kiddos. - Are you all right? I'm fine. Mom, you look awful. So would you if you'd almost been hit by a truck. Now it's time to go to bed. No, wait a minute. I'm going to carry you up these steps. I always wanted to play Rhett Butler. Oh. Oh. Um, maybe we should-- Walk. --walk. Be careful. Talk to your mom in the morning, kids. Let's go. Mom, will you be able to come to school soon to talk to Mrs. Wadsworth? - Sure. In the morning, Penny. Can I sign your cast, Mom? In the morning. As soon as you learn how to write. - Ha ha ha ha ha ha. - Everything's all right. Just go to sleep. Go to bed, kids. Go on. Everything will be fine. You OK? Yeah. Let me take your coat. Thank you. [grunts] Cold. I love you. Steph. STEPHANIE [ON PHONE]: Breeny, how are you? I'm afraid the roof caved in. We've got to tell Grant everything. What happened? On the way home from the faculty party, we had an accident. Are you all right? Oh, well, yes and no. I broke my wrist. My arm's in a cast. It's got to be that way for a month. Oh, Breeny. How's Grant? He's fine. But the game is over. I'll tell him everything in the morning. No, you can't! Breeny, our marriage was shaky enough before! This will finish it! Believe me. I wish there was another way. But there isn't. He'll probably take the kids away from me! Breeny, you were the one who always thought up all the games! You've got to figure out something! Just a few more weeks. You don't seem to understand, Steph. It's gotten a lot more complicated. I wore your pretzel necklace tonight by accident. Grant took it as a sign. And? And we had the accident. But if I have to stay here another month-- You've got to think of something. I know you can do it. Please! I don't want him to take my kids away from me. Please! All right. I'll try. [sighs] I knew you would. I knew you would. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, by the way, um, I saw Rita Macmillan. What did you think? I think she's quite a number. You could probably handle her better than I couldn't. Speaking of that, how did you handle Carlo? He's a very persistent man. Don't you dare get me into something I'll regret. Well, I had to promise him something to get rid of him. So I promised him I'd go to-- to Rome next week to decorate his villa. I thought you'd be back! No, you tell him no. He doesn't understand that word! Well, if you have to go, then you just be very careful you don't get me involved again. I won't. I won't. I promise. Listen, Breeny, I know this is not going to be easy. I'll do my best to handle Carlo. You do your best to handle Grant. If anybody can, you can. I certainly hope so. I'll call you in a couple of days. Good luck. I'll need it. STEPHANIE: It's breathtaking. You sound as if you're seeing it for the first time. Well, every time you see Rome, it's like seeing it for the first time, isn't it? Look, Sabrina. Look. STEPHANIE: It's unbelievable. And tonight will be unbelievable too. Carlo, I came here to see about decorating your villa. But you came. That is the most important thing. Look, amore. Look. To fly solo over Rome is forbidden. But it is the only way to see its beauty. Be careful. Don't worry. I'm here. Oh, Carlo. This is beautiful. What fabulous statues. There is a story about these statues. The emperor Nero, you know-- - Buongiorno, signore. - Oui. Ciao, Mario. Ciao. He once entertained a very beautiful woman in this very garden. And she refused him. And as you can see, she was turned to stone. It's a true story. [chuckles] Mm. The dinner was delicious. And I think the villa is beautiful. I wouldn't change a thing. Everything's perfect-- the painting, the lamps. Don't change anything. And the bedroom? Uh, I wouldn't change anything in there either. I won't. I want everything the way it is right now. Carlo, we can't. We can't? [laughs] It is not the first time we will make love. I wish I could explain. I really do. But I don't know how to. No capisce. Really, I don't understand. I'm not playing games with you. I know you are not. You have never been one to play games. But then why do you come all the way to Rome to say no like a schoolgirl? Why didn't you send me away at the first date? What's happened to you? For some reason I do not understand, suddenly, you-- you, who was always so alive-- is now afraid to live. I know. I am afraid to live. Don't be. I'm here. I'll always be here. Like Rome. Like you. But I may be gone soon. So may we all. That's why-- why we are here. It is best to grab life quickly, and eat of it until you can eat no more. [sighs] Take what you want. I want you. You want me too. I feel it. [moans] Carlo. Take life with both hands. Well, hello. Um-- I'll see you tonight, hm? Tonight. Hello. LADY CHASSON: Hello. Well, now we know what she was doing in Rome. What that Romans do. Oh, Breeny. Where have you been? I've been lost without you. I'm sorry, Bryan. I got carried away. You know how it is. No, I don't know how it is. But I can guess. All right, now, let's get down to business. I want to sell something very expensive to make up for being late. You can. I want you to find a match for that Roman vase I bought from you. The Roman vase? See how stunning it would look if I had the pair. You know, I think I've seen one of these in our new consignment. I think I'll just go have a look. No, no, lover, you stay here. I'll go have a look. But I tell you, it's a wild goose chase. That's Attila the Hun, no? Who? Richard. I thought he regarded you as, uh, his personal property. Well, after all, England is a free country. Oh, really? Anne Boleyn had her head chopped off. I'm sorry, Lady Chasson. Nothing even similar. Oh. And I was in the mood for spending money. Oh, I'm sure, at that price, Sabrina will find something, or have something aged. [laughs] Believe me. I will find something. Thank you. Give my best to Carolo. I'm sure you're already getting yours. Ciao. Uh, Bryan, wasn't there a vase in that shipment you brought from Venice? No, it's just knickknacks. Well, I think I'll just have another look. Um-- Let me see if I can find that vase. Oh, Breeny, you're so impulsive! [laughs] It doesn't hurt to have a look. No, I'm telling you, Lady Chasson, I mean, she's a complete idiot. But I'm not going to try and find her a pair just because we can make money out of her. Isn't this it? [grunts] Let's just have a look. No, no, my dear. Listen, please. Honestly, I promise you. I promise you. It's not even the right century, my dear. - Well, it looks the same to me. - This isn't the right century. I tell you, put it back in the-- - Bryan! [vase shatters] What have I done? It's all right. It was an accident. We're covered. Lloyd's of London. It's all right. We're insured. Of course we are. I-- I forgot. Sure. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Bryan? BRYAN: Mm-hmm? STEPHANIE: What's that? Should we call the police? No, we better not involve the gallery until we've had this checked out. Can you do that? Yes. I'd like you to leave this to me. Take an early lunch. I don't want to leave you alone. Please. Really. You are a treasure. What would I do without you, Bryan? [chuckles] WOMAN [ON PHONE]: Waldorf Towers, can I help you? Richard Blackwell, please, penthouse suite. RICHARD [ON PHONE]: Hello? Richard? RICHARD [ON PHONE]: Yeah? Better get a seat on Concorde. RICHARD [ON PHONE]: Now? Uh-huh. Everything's just hit the fan. RICHARD [ON PHONE]: Damn. CHILDREN: --strong as iron bands. His hair is crisp and black and long. His face is like the tan. [screaming] Boys! Girls! That's my little Andrew. Although I wish his father had more of that in him. Girls! Boys! Any further disturbance and you will all get an F. Penny, why are you such a troublemaker? I didn't do a thing, Mrs. Wadsworth. It was Andrew who started it all. He keeps on pushing and shoving and yelling. What in the world are these? And I didn't do nothing. They're string puppets from Venice, Italy. My mom got them for us. I've been running a little play for them. I thought you might like it. Where are the puppets from last year that gave you? I wanted to try something new. Fantasy, sort of. Piro and Pirette. I've been working for days. I'm sure you'd like what I've been doing. You are to get rid of those puppets and use the ones I gave you. PENNY: But these are beautiful. If you'd only watch once what I've been trying to do-- Don't talk back to me. You're to do what you're told. Just listen, please. All I ask-- That's enough out of you. You're out of the program. [sobbing] MRS. WADSWORTH: All right, children. Once again. Under the spreading chestnut tree, the village smithy stands. CHILDREN: Under the spreading chestnut tree, the village smithy stands. Children, excuse me. Uh, Mrs. Wadsworth. Oh, Mrs. Roberts. That's right. Uh, Mrs. Wadsworth, I thought that this school encouraged originality. Originality, Mrs. Roberts, but not insubordination. Oh. That's why I agreed to talk about Penny with you today. She has to be taught respect. Hm. I did want to have this conversation in private. But under the circumstances, you give me no choice. You're not a teacher, Mrs. Wadsworth. You're a tyrant. This is hardly the time to-- My daughter is over there, crying. Can you think of a better time? Well, I can certainly see where your daughter gets her attitude from. Please leave the stage, Mrs. Roberts. I have work to do. Mrs. Wadsworth, uh, I believe that some of my taxes help to pay your salary, isn't that so, along with all the other parents in this auditorium? So in effect, you work for us, don't you? Will you get off this stage? SABRINA: I want to settle this now. Penny has created an entire play all on her own, and you haven't even been curious enough to take a look at it. Her mind is open. Yours is not. Mrs. Roberts-- SABRINA: I'm not through. I want Penny to grow up feeling good about herself, feeling free to learn and create all on her own. Now, if you can't give her that little bit of freedom to go her own way, perhaps I can convince the principal of this school to allow you to go yours. Hm? No, no, no, no. Until you're completely healed, you're going to sit there and let us serve you. Ta-da! A gastronomic delight. I helped make that. You did? I think he baked it in ceramics course. - Ah. - Ah. There we are. Well, it looks wonderful. Ah. Eat it all, Mom, or Penny will think you don't really like it. Mm. Do you like it? Mm. Oh, yeah. Delicious. MARK: Eat it all, Mom. Um, you know something? I'm not really all that hungry. Do you mind? And I'm a little tired anyway, because I was out all day. It's my first day. You didn't overdo it, did you, hon? No, I'm fine. Maybe you should go upstairs, pour a nice bath, lie down, relax. Hm. Sounds like a great idea. I think I will. - No, no. Leave that. Are you sure? Positive. [laughs] OK. Good night. Thanks again, Mom, for telling off Mrs. Wadsworth. Aw. Every person in my school wishes you could be their mom. [sighs] Good night. Aren't you going to kiss Mr. Cat? You always used to. Oh, sure. Sure, Mr. Cat. [cat howls] Ow! What's wrong with him? Oh, you know something? I think he was out very late last night. I heard him howling on the backyard fence. No, that was me. Hm? [imitates meowing] [chuckles] Good night. Are you and Mom making up? Well, there are straws in the wind. Is that divorce thing finished? Well, I certainly hope so. Do you and Mom love each other again? We're working on it. Boy, that's great. And the garage can fix the station wagon too. Well, thank you for putting things in their proper perspective. Are you finished? Pick up, pick up the plates. Pick up the plates. Save this for tomorrow night's dinner. Got it? [imitates trumpet] [knocking] Need some help? [laughs] Oh, I think I can manage. Yeah, let me get your back at least, hm? OK. Forward. There we are. How's that? - Mm. Nice. Um, a little higher. Right there. - Right there? Yes. Oh, did I tell you that, um, Chancellor Webster called and wanted to, uh, have a meeting with you? Mm-hmm. I did? Good dinner? I forgot. I think I can-- I can manage. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. You're on. You know, you do have a beautiful body, Steph. Good night. Good night. Grant, we have to talk. I'm not doing that. Red. [inaudible] DEALER: 23, red. STEPHANIE: We won! We won! Are you always this lucky? Do you want to play some more? Mm-hmm. At home. Get your chips. [giggles] Cash please. [sighs] Carlo, thank you. For what? For everything. Thank you. Beautiful. - Who the hell is this bloke? - What are you doing? CARLO: Let her go. Shut up. I'm taking you home. I said, let her go. Oh. Take your filthy hands off me. Who are you? Explain to this gentleman who I am. [grunting] - How do you do? - Carlo! Come on. Tiresome. Get him out of my club. It'd be my pleasure, Mr. Blackwell. Come on, lovey. We're going home. Come on. Please. Please, Richard. Come on. STEPHANIE: Mrs. Thirkell, please! Mrs. Thirkell! Mrs. Thirkell! Don't ever embarrass me in front of other people again! That's the last time that Italian romeo comes sniffing around, I can promise you. - Get out of here. Ah, shut up and listen to me. [whimpers] You and Bryan have been prying into things at the gallery that don't concern you. I wanted it stopped. Got it? Now. Got it? Yes! Good. I've come all the way back from New York to retrieve my property and to give you a little warning. You know far too much about me already. You'll be a lot safer if you don't know any more. [grunting] I'll collect the rent some other time, ducky. Are you all right, madam? Lover's quarrel. Good night, Mrs. Thirkell. I'll be back later, dear one. STEPHANIE: Inspector, I'm sure. Richard's hiding the drugs in the antiques we bought from Italy. There's no duty. So nobody ever checks. MCGRATH: Very neat. I like it. Do you think it's enough to arrest him? He'll simply say he didn't know they were in there. He'll be out within 24 hours. No, we need more evidence, from the Italian side. The mafia is very strong, very powerful. But I have friends in the Italian government-- important friends. I will ask them to help. Thank you. We need all the help we can get. And thank you both for having the courage to come in and see me. Shall I arrange protection them, sir? That will not be necessary. We are leaving this afternoon. We'll be in my yacht until you need us. Carlo, I'd feel a lot better if we had protection, at least to the plane. Sergeant, will you take care of it? OWENS: Right, sir. Thank you very much for all your help. Thank you. We'll do our best. Thank you. Goodbye. BRYAN: Richard. I'll never forget him. Carlo and I are leaving the country. Do you want to come with us? No. No, I'll stay here, pretend I know nothing. Bryan. You've gone on holiday. Why you being so brave? I'm not brave. I'm scared to death! Now, where can I reach you if I need you? Uh, it's called the Romano-- the yacht Romano. And you can get it to the International Marine Order. We'll be in Italy-- Portofino. Well, I guess that's it. Goodbye. Be careful. Well, you take of yourself. Sabrina? Oh. Oh. How To Get Good Grades, Continued-- get close to Professor Grant Roberts in a double bed. Signed, an A student. Right. Well, you know me well enough, Bill, to know these notes are just a pack of lies. It's just some co-ed with a sick mind. Probably. Well, if you know that these are lies, you don't have to bring these up to the board of trustees. Unless you force me to. How can you live with yourself? This is not an easy job. I have to do a lot of things I don't like doing. Well, I don't have to and I'm not going to, just because some moron on the board of trustees sees communists underneath his bed. James L. Nolan is the chairman of the board. I want this university to get the research center grant. And you know as well as I, unless you get rid of Professor Skolnikoff, there's not a chance in hell Nolan will give us the millions we want to build it. You're not going to stop that. I want to see it built too, but not at the expense of losing the best research mind I've ever met! I'm asking you for the last time. Get rid of him, Grant. Please. Dimitri stays. Or we both go. That might be arranged. A lot of people are going to believe these notes. And if you're fired from here because of them, you're going to find it very difficult to go on breaking through, with or without your brilliant Russian ally, at any other university. I don't want to ruin your career. Take a look at your own, Bill, if you have a strong enough stomach. I got a message. Sounded like life and death. Miss Hot Pants is here. Go right in. Professor? Hello, Rita. Come in. Well, to what do I owe the honor, Mrs. Roberts? I wanted to talk to you. About what? About you and my husband. If it's about that stupid anonymous note, I told your husband I didn't write it. So there's nothing to talk about. SABRINA: Sit down, Rita. I think we have a lot to talk about. I would like to ask you a few questions. Please. Why isn't your husband here? Because I want to talk to you, woman to woman. Don't you trust the all-American boy? Of course, if I have a husband that handsome, I might feel the same way. This isn't a kid's game. You wrote notes. You're still writing notes, this time to Chancellor Webster. You're playing with a man's career, Rita. And I won't let you do that. I didn't write any notes. You're lying. I swear to you! Then what did happen? Nothing. I tried, Mrs. Roberts. I tried my best. Right here in this office. Peeled right down to the bare facts and offered myself to him on a platter for a measly A in Genetics. And you know what he gave me? A lecture. Can you believe it? He showed me the door and suggested I study more. Mrs. Roberts, don't you really know what you have? Possibly the only one in captivity. Last of the breed. A faithful husband. He belongs in the Smithsonian. Well, if you didn't write those notes, somebody did. Carlo, are there other people coming? Just a few friends. Some music before we start the cruise. Oh. I wanted you to forget everything else. STEPHANIE: Thank you, darling. [gasps] Marco! Marco, don't be jealous. This is Sabrina. And no matter what you say, we are going to enjoy ourselves. [GIGGLING] Oh, he's wonderful. We certainly are. And I'm going to drink a lot of champagne. CARLO: Do you like it? STEPHANIE: Yes, I do. We're absolutely going to enjoy ourselves. [giggling] [ON PHONE] So you can see why he had to leave London. Oh my god, Steph. Are you all right? Listen. Don't worry. We told the police everything, at least everything I knew. And don't worry about the gallery either. Bryan's is handling everything and he knows exactly where we are. I'm not so sure that was such a good idea. Bryan and Richard go back a long way. I'd better come back. No, no, no! It's too dangerous. You're safer in America. Well, you'd be safer here too. Steph, aren't you ever coming home? [sighs] It's not that. It's just that-- [sighs] --I'm living. I'm living for the first time in my life. And what about Grant? Chancellor Webster is having a hearing. He's going to get everything out in the open. Grant's job could be at stake. Don't you want to be back here for that? I found out there was nothing between him and Rita Macmillan. I'm sure of it. Oh. Steph, don't you care? The only thing I care about is living the life you led. Me? Are you sleeping with Carlo? [LAUGHING] Oh, we can't sleep very much. Steph! Oh, Breeny. Don't be so righteous. What about you and Grant? I understand. I do. Believe me. Now you listen to me. I'm going to tell Grant everything after the hearing, unless you agree to come back now. So? Tell him the truth. Do you know what you're saying? [sighs] I do, I don't. I don't know. I'm going to tell him, Stephanie. I'm going to tell him everything! Stephanie? Are you there? Steph? Carlo. Is everything all right? We will be soon. Oh, Carlo. Hold me. Please. [bell ringing] My goal and Mr. Nolan's goal as chairman of the board of trustees are the same-- to protect this university's good name, to make it the finest in the country-- the world. And to have one damn year when our football team has a winning season. BILL: That too. The scandal that has developed around Professor Roberts-- You developed it, Bill. Let me finish, please. Unless it is proven false, it will be impossible for him to continue his work and retain the respect of the scientific community. But you know it's a lie. BILL: I'm not so sure. You also defy my authority by continuing to work on sensitive research with a Russian scientist-- It's a hell of a lot more boring than all of this "sex for grades" garbage. Do you have any proof that it's just garbage? My word and my reputation. [chuckles] Hell, we had a president of the United States who asked us to believe his word and his reputation. He had to resign too. No, I need more proof than that. Mr. Nolan, if you need more proof, isn't the fact that I'm here proof enough? I believe in my husband. I believe he's dedicated to the work he does, and to his family. And I don't think he had anything to do with that scandal. Mr. Nolan, would your wife stand by you if she thought you were cheating on her? My wife died a year ago last June, young lady. I'm sorry. So am I. She was a wonderful woman. Mrs. Roberts, I appreciate your coming to your husband's assistance, but it proves nothing but your loyalty to him. I hardly call that nothing. It's a lot more than just nothing, Chancellor. Yes. Well, I still have the good of the university to consider. Have you considered the importance of the research that Dimi and I are doing? I mean, do you really understand what DNA is, Bill? It's the key that unlocks the mysteries of all human life. And every day, Harold, Dimi, and I are learning a little bit more about why it influences certain cells to multiply, for no apparent reason-- insidious cells that attack and ravage the human body. Some people call it cancer. DNA determines why your hair is brown, your eyes are blue, your mind is closed. Grant, I'm asking you to resign. And I'm asking Professor Harold Adams to head the department and to assume the chairmanship of the coming research center. Congratulations, Professor Adams. You've worked very hard. Not as hard as my wife. Harold. I don't want the job. I don't deserve it. - Harold shut up. Damn it, Helen, why don't you shut up? And why don't you stop writing those poison pen letters about Grant to try and get me a job I don't even want? You idiot. I should have spoken up sooner. I'm sorry. Well, quite a lively little meeting. And I thought all the action was going to be at the football game. Jim, I had no idea those were being written by Helen. No, but I have a feeling that you had a pretty good idea they were lies. But you preferred to ignore that, because you thought I wouldn't finance your research center if there was a Russian working in it. You've never made any secret about your hatred for them. No. Well, I don't have to like them, do I? I learned a lot here today. I hope my wife loved me as much as you love your husband. I don't mind telling you, I was very touched. Thank you, sir. Hell, they only call you "sir" when they know you've got money. The name's Jim. Bill, you're going to get your building. And I want it to be the biggest, finest of any university in the country. Because it's going to be called The Harriet Nolan Center for Cancer Research. If it had been built sooner, she might still be around. I'm going to the football game. Anybody care to join me? I've got a box. Oh, thanks, Jim, but my wife and I have some celebrating to do. It's just as well. We're going to lose anyway. GRANT: Thank you. SABRINA: For what? GRANT: For believing in me. SABRINA: Oh. GRANT: No, no. You were the one that made the difference, you know, with old Jim Nolan. SABRINA: Oh, I didn't. It was his wife. She must have been quite a woman. GRANT: He must have loved her very much. SABRINA: Mm. Almost as much as I love you, as much as I'm going to love you forever. Nothing lasts forever, Grant. What? We will. When we're 90 years old, we'll still be tottering into each other's arms. And when we're 106, maybe the kids will finally believe that we're not going to be getting a divorce. Right? Grant, we-- Shh. [MUSIC - THE POINTER SISTERS, "I'M SO EXCITED"] I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you. We shouldn't even think about tomorrow. Sweet memories will last a long, long time. We'll have a good time, baby. Don't you worry. And if we're still playing around, boy, that's just fine. Let's get excited. 'Cause we just can't hide it. No, no, no. I'm about to lose control and I think I like it. I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it. I know, I know, I know, I know I want you, I want you. Lovely party. Ooh, boy, I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you. I want to squeeze you, please you. No, I just can't get enough. And if you move real slow, I'll let it go. I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it. No, no, no, no, no. I'm about to lose control and I think I like it. I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it. And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you. [squeals] [giggles] I love you, Sabrina. I love you too, Carlo. Ooh, boy, I want to love you, feel you, wrap myself around you. I want to squeeze you, please you. No, I just can't get enough. And if you move real slow, I'll let it go. I'm so excited. I just can't hide it. I'm about to lose control and I think I like it. Oh, yeah. I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it. And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you. I want you. [explosion] [phone ringing] Hello? MRS. THIRKELL [ON PHONE]: Hello, this is Mrs. Thirkell. What? MRS. THIRKELL [ON PHONE]: Mrs. Thirkell, calling from London. Who? MRS. THIRKELL [ON PHONE]: Is Mrs. Roberts there please? [sighs] Yeah, she's here. Hold on, hold on. Who's calling you from London? "Threlkill--" Mrs. "Threlkill," is it? What? Oh, yes, I'll take it. Hello, Mrs. Thirkell. Thirkell, yes. MRS. THIRKELL [ON PHONE]: Is this Mrs. Roberts? Mm-hmm. MRS. THIRKELL [ON PHONE]: I'm afraid your sister has been killed in an accident. What? MRS. THIRKELL [ON PHONE]: There was an explosion on the yacht she was on. Oh, my god. What's the matter? Oh, my god. There's been an accident, and Steph is dead. You mean Sabrina? What? Sabrina, yes. Sabrina. Oh, my god. MRS. THIRKELL [ON PHONE]: Mrs. Roberts? Mrs. Roberts? Are you there? [sobbing] MRS. THIRKELL [ON PHONE]: Mrs. Roberts? VICAR: Listen, then, Lord, in your mercy, to our prayers, that the gates of paradise may be open to your servant, and that we who are left may console one another with words of faith. The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. In spite of this tragic accident, in death, as in life, the spirit of Sabrina Longworth will be with us always. Through Christ our Lord. Amen. ALL: Amen. --resurrection, in whose bodies are subject to decay, grant we pray that your servant may rest at peace in this grave, until that day when you, the resurrection and the life, enrich her with life made new. May she, in the light of your countenance, behold eternal light in heaven, you who live and reign forever. Amen. Oh, I'm so sorry. We never should have done it. Steph. I thought this might help you sleep. I don't want to sleep. I want to talk. Well, you should at least try to get some rest, hon. Would you please sit down, Grant? I have something to tell you. [laughs] All right. All right. What's so important? I'm not Stephanie. Right. Come to bed. Grant. Stephanie's dead. I'm Sabrina. Why are you joking around like this? Stephanie, come on. I'm not joking. It happened in Venice. She was unhappy with her life. I was unhappy with mine. It was going to be just like when we were kids. We'd just trade places in each other's lives for a little while-- a week. Are you serious? I'm telling you the truth. We didn't mean to hurt anyone. We weren't hurting anyone. It's just that everything started to go wrong. When we had the accident, I couldn't go back without you knowing. And then she wouldn't let me tell you, because she didn't want it to destroy everything between you. You're Sabrina? Yes. My god. You stood by that grave and you never told me. You never told me that my wife was lying in that coffin. What kind of game is this that you two girls were playing? [laughs] It must have been a hell of a lot of fun though, huh? Lying to me and the kids. I never dreamed it would all turn out like this. But you know what happened? I fell in love with you. I didn't want it to happen. Believe me. God knows I didn't want it to happen. I fell in love with the children too. If there was any way to bring their mother back, I would do anything! But there is nothing I can do! All I can do is try to talk to them. You're not going to tell those kids anything. Now get out of here. Get out! The plane is here! They're-- they're here! They're here! Let's go! There they are! It's just Dad. [laughs] Hey, kiddo. How you doing? - Hi, Dad. Where's Mom? - Welcome back, Grant. Where's Mom? She's, um-- she's still in London. How long is she going to be gone. For a while. Settling her sister's estate? Yeah, sort of. Yeah. Dad, when's she coming home? Does that mean Mom won't be home for a little while? You know, I am starved. What do you say we go home and I'll make you some of my special hamburgers, huh? Your hamburgers are awful! Dad, when's Mom going to be back? We'll talk about it later. How are things at the lab? All right, who's ready for another burger? The last one I had wasn't very good. [blows] Here. - Are these-- - Oh. Dropped. We're good. - Are these even better? - What? They're just the way I like them-- burned on the outside, charred on the inside. Penny, you want one? I wanted mine rare. Oh, well, you had to put your order in 24 hours in advance for that one. I can't eat any more, even with ketchup. Neither can I. OK. Um, come here. I want to show you something. Whatever it is, I hope you didn't cook it. Um, I set this thing up here-- come here-- so that, um, you could see something here, Mark. What do-- what do-- what do you see? Nothing. Oh. Uh, now what do you see? Just a bunch of white stuff. That white stuff, uh, it's nebulae. It's new stars that are being born. What you don't see are the black holes, which are the old stars, which are dying. You see now, there's a pattern to nature. For everything that dies, something else is born again. So nothing-- nothing ever really dies. Are you trying to tell us something, Dad? Because if you are, you can just say it. [sighs] This is going to be very hard for you to understand. It wasn't your mom who came back from her birthday in Venice. Yes, it was. She brought us presents. Yeah, she bought me those neat puppets and she told off Mrs. Wadsworth. She was wonderful. Well, it wasn't your mom. That was your Aunt Sabrina from London. No, she died. You and Mom went to the funeral. She died. Come here, pal. When they were in London, your mother and Aunt Sabrina decided to play a little game. They decided that they would just change places for a while. Huh? Why would they do that? Well, maybe because they were unhappy with their lives. So they just changed with each other. You mean, it's, like, a joke? Our real mom's waiting in London to come home and surprise us? No. Oh, I know-- [sighs] No. I want to know where my real mom is. Well, when your-- when your mom was taking Aunt Sabrina's place in London, something terrible happened. A boat that she was taking a trip on had an accident. Oh, no. That was Mom? Yeah. Yes. Mark, your mother's in heaven. And maybe right now, like one of those stars, she's being born again. You're lying to us! Nobody get born again! When you're dead, you're just a bunch of bones in a box! Our mom is dead! Our real mom is dead! Mark-- Mark. I'm going to do my very best to take her place. You're no good as a mother! You can't even cook a good hamburger! You couldn't be a mother in a million years! Dad? Is Mom really gone? Yeah. Why do people have to die? It's just not fair. I know it's not, honey. But there's a reason for life. And there's a reason for death. Of course, we don't know what it is yet. Maybe we never will. Maybe it's part of the plan of the universe. Sounds like a pretty stupid plan to me. Whatever happens, you die. There's no way to win. Who thought that up? [sighs] I wish I could have thought of a better way to tell you. I'm sorry. I wish I felt like crying. You will. We've been informed by the Italian police about their investigations of the explosion on the yacht Romano. It seems your sister's death may not have been an accident, Mrs. Roberts. It looks like murder. We're not 100% certain, of course. But the explosion on the yacht took place in shallow water. So divers were able to examine a great deal of the wreckage. What we believe is that either the bomb went off prematurely, or whoever was responsible for it had expected the yacht to sink without trace. Your sister came to see us shortly before they left, frightened by threats from Mr. Blackwell. Did you question him? He conveniently dropped out of sight as soon as the investigation began. OWENS: Unfortunately, he has a lot of friends in Italy, one of whom may have done this job for him. The missing piece is, how could Blackwell have known exactly where your sister was going to be? Bryan Foxworth. We questioned him. He said he didn't know where they were going. He was lying. I talked to my sister from the boat. She told me that the only other person who knew where she was Bryan. I may be able to help you. How? Well, I'm not exactly who you think I am. But more important, I'm not who Richard thinks I am. And when he finds out, I assure you he'll come out of hiding. I'm Sabrina, and alive. [chuckles] Oh, darling, I'm so sorry to have to break it to you this way, but there was no other choice. Is it really my Breeny? Yes. Breeny. Oh. Oh, my dove. Bryan. Oh, darling. My treasure, you're alive. How did this happen? Well, you see, uh, Stephanie and I decided to trade places for a while, as a lark. Oh, Breeny. I know. Naughty. [clucks] The theory is that Richard murdered Stephanie because he thought she knew too much. Did you know about the drugs he was running through our gallery? Yes, yes, you told me. I mean, Steph-- oh, this is just like being in [inaudible].. I don't know who I'm talking to. Listen to me, Bryan. Hm? If we work together, we can find enough evidence around here to put Richard away for a long time. Will you help me? Of course I will. Now all we have to do is hope that Richard doesn't find out who I am. [phone ringing] MAN [ON PHONE]: Hello, Royal Towers. Richard? MAN [ON PHONE]: Royal Towers, can I help you? Uh, please, Richard Blackwell, penthouse suite. MAN [ON PHONE]: Thank you. SABRINA: I don't know. Maybe it was Venice-- the masks, carnival. It was supposed to be fun. We weren't very happy with our own lives. It's funny, the grass always seems greener, doesn't it? And to keep something like that from me, as if I were a person who would talk. I'm sorry. That's the whole story, except that I feel so guilty. If I thought everything which happened to me was my fault, I would have thrown myself into that freezing lake long ago. [chuckles] With Carlo, she was having, uh, an affair? Well then, you and her husband-- how do you feel about him, eh? As bad as that? Worse. I love him. He hates me. Probably the children hate me too. [sighs] Twins taking the place of each other. Shakespeare, "The Comedy of Errors." I wish I could laugh it off like you. Like me? Don't you know this is a mask too? Alexandra the Great, principessa of nowhere. You know what is somewhere? [inaudible] Beautiful, dripping [inaudible]. And the poor, desparate pianist who loved me so. I should have married him instead of my prince. Am I boring you? I know I'm boring myself. [chuckles] No, I'm sorry, Sandy. I'm just not very good company today. Maybe I should be alone. I'll-- I'll go take a walk. Of course. Sabrina! But don't throw yourself in that lake. I thought of it first! Mark, Penny, we have the tree! [whistling] Mark, Penny, come help me with the tree! Let's put it right here. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Ah! [laughter] - That much to spare, huh? - Perfect. Yeah. Mark doesn't feel like trimming the tree tonight. Aw, come on, Mark! It's tree trimming time! Won't be long until Santa comes down that chimney, am I right, Dimi In my country, it is the KGB. Oh! All right. Let's take it from the top. Dimi, you have the hazardous job of putting the angel right on top of the tree. And Penny, why don't you give a hand, OK? Oh, come on! I can still climb a ladder! Thanks, God. God? I'll deny I ever said that. Do you want to take one of these and put it on the other side? Mom always used to put the angel on the top of the tree. You know that. Yeah. I know that. You know what? Santa Claus wants you to open one gift tonight. Yeah. He told me that he had to hunt all over the North Pole just to find it for you, and he hopes you like it. I think I saw him put it right in here someplace. Let's see here. Oh, yes. Uh-oh. He forgot to wrap it. But I know he hopes you'll like it. And so do I. It's just like the puppet Mom brought me from Venice. Yeah! She didn't, though, did she? No. That wasn't Mom at all. That was Aunt Sabrina. Maybe it would be better I go. No, no, no, no. You know, Santa, he left a present for you. - For me? - Yeah, sure! Oh, no, he shouldn't have. It's in the closet somewhere. But if he did, I hope it is one bottle of vodka! [laughs] Ah, he put your name on it and he spelled it right and everything. Excuse me. Maybe it's upstairs. Mark, did you take Dimi's present? What present? The one I had downstairs in the closet with his name on it. I didn't take anything. Mark. I know where you keep things, young man. Mark, I know how you feel. But it's not going to do any good to start stealing again. It's not going to bring your mom back. Now tell me the truth. Did you take Dimi's present? Dad, did Aunt Sabrina tell you the truth? What? Did she tell you who she really was, or did you have to make her? I don't think that matters now, young man. Yes, it does. We want to know what she said. Come on, Dad. We really want to know. She told me the truth. Was she sorry? Did she want to tell us? Yes. Dad, did Aunt Sabrina really want to leave us? Or did you make her go? Look, we're not talking about Aunt Sabrina or me. We're talking about you stealing things, young man. What did you do with Dimi's present. Answer me. I don't have to. You won't answer us. You know, Mark, I swear to you, you're starting-- Grant, I find my present. It was under your coat in the closet. I think I'm glad I am a bachelor. [phone ringing] Hello? MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: Professor Grant Roberts? Yes. MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: I'm sorry to call you so early. This is the police in London. Who? Detective Chief Inspector McGrath. It's about your wife. My wife? MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: The explosion on the yacht. We now have positive confirmation that it was murder. What? MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: A plastic explosive. I'm sorry, Mr. Roberts. My god. Why would anybody want to kill my wife? MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: They didn't know she was your wife. I understand you do know about the sisters switching identities. Uh, yes. MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: You sister-in-law is now working very closely with us. What, Sabrina? What's she doing? She's letting the man we suspect is the murderer find out her true identity to bring him out of hiding. Well, that sounds awfully dangerous. We've explained to her that, if she persists, it could mean a life. She won't listen to you? MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: No. She's very headstrong. She has a mind of her own, you know. Yes, I know. Uh, well, why don't you stop her? Well, unfortunately, without her, we wouldn't be making any progress. And she is. Yes, well, uh, what do you want me to do? What can-- how can I help you? We need you to come to London. Did she ask for me? MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: No. Would I have to meet with her? MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: Oh, that's up to you. We'd like you to make a statement. We'll arrange transportation. Can you come immediately? Yeah, all right. MCGRATH [ON PHONE]: Fine. We'll call you back with the flight number. Thank you, Professor. Goodbye. Grant Roberts? Yes. Please see the gentleman over there, sir. Thank you. Chief Inspector McGrath. Sounds much grander than the salary. I know what you mean. Now, if you like, we can stop off at your hotel on the way there. - No, no, no. That's fine. I've got clothes. SABRINA: Bryan, we've just got to try to get Richard out of hiding. BRYAN: Darling, it's the festive season. For once, let's forget about Richard. SABRINA: All. Right. Agreed. Can you buy every toy in the store in 60 minutes? I'll do my best. Meet us here in exactly one hour. Right, sir. Do you think I'm doing the right thing buying Christmas presents? BRYAN [ON SPEAKER]: She always bought the presents. Now, come on. Where's your Christmas spirit? SABRINA [ON SPEAKER]: I'm working on it. BRYAN: Come on, move yourself. Come on. And you were unable to detect the difference? Well, sometimes, you just lose sight of those that are closest to you. So another woman was able to step forward and take her place? Well, she's not just another woman. And she fooled the children too? Well, she was kind, caring. She, um-- she charmed-- yes, she-- she fooled them. She fooled me too. Have you had any contact with her at all since the funeral? No. No, I haven't. You really miss those children, don't you? More than I can say. I want to send them these packages whether they open them or not. I just them to know I'm thinking of them. Now, come on, jingle bells. Where's the Christmas spirit? Hello, ducky. You look very much alive for a corpse. Richard. the One and only Bryan, what did you-- I loathe Christmas. We're going to have a nice, quiet little ride to some lonely, picturesque spot, away from all these awful crowds. Move. [ON SPEAKER] Quite a little scheme you and your sister devised. Had me fooled right to the very end. However, Bryan here-- OWENS: Stay close. RICHARD [ON SPEAKER]: --might not have known who you were. That transmitter on her doesn't have much range from inside a car. Listen to me, Bryan. You know he's going to try to lay this whole thing on your head. He doesn't care for you. Did you ever get your fair sure of the drugs he ran through the gallery? RICHARD [ON SPEAKER]: Oh. We give everyone their fair share. Even Stephanie? You sister should have had more sense than to run to the police. So should you. I hate doing things twice. Don't you, dear? We've got him. Heading west on Bronson Road. All units, move in. HQ, this is Owens. We're jammed in traffic, behind the Albert Hall. What a waste. Oh, Richard, please. There won't even be enough time to collect the rent. Richard. You're making it very easy for me, ducky. They must have found it! I may go, but I'll take you with me. They've got to be following. Well, come on, come on. Move it! [tires screeching] OWENS: Quick, get after them! [car horn honks] Well, that's great. We've lost them! Aerial unit, are you receiving me? Over. AERIAL OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Receiving you loud and clear. Receiving you loud and clear. Aerial unit over. Have you spotted them? Over. Yes, we see them. They're going around the Albert Hall towards Hyde Park Corner. All cars, delta operation. Keep on lookout for a suspect car proceeding east towards Hyde Park corner. OFFICER 1 [ON RADIO]: Aerial unit, this is B bravo. I've spotted him. I'm in a position to follow. B bravo now in pursuit. [police sirens] Owens, do you read me? OWENS [ON RADIO]: Yes, sir. We've lost radio contact with them. Something must have happened to the wire. Damn. He may have found it on her. My god. Foolish, foolish. I told her this was foolish. AERIAL OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Suspect car is now at Hyde Park Corner. They're heading for Belgrave Square. Aerial unit to police car two, please make your way to Belgrave Sqaure and assist. OFFICER 2 [ON RADIO]: Will do. [police sirens] [car horn honks] AERIAL OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Suspect car has left Belgrave Square. Vehicle now proceeding down Consitution Hill towards Buckingham Palace. [inaudible] bravo unit from aerial unit. Please converge your suspect car at Victoria Memorial. Now in pursuit. [police sirens] AERIAL OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Suspect car passing [inaudible] Parade towards [inaudible]. He's rounding Trafalgar Sqaure and he's going to take off on the-- no, no, he's not. He's going down Whitehall. Heading left towards the river. All units, head for Westminster Bridge, Waterloo Bridge, Tower Bridge. If he tries to cross the river, we've got him. [police sirens] AERIAL OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Suspect car still following embankment. Suspect car still keeping to river bank. It could be he's heading towards Tower Bridge. I think we've got him. All units, block off Tower Bridge. Block off Borough High Street. [police sirens] AERIAL OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Yes, he's definitely turning towards Tower Bridge. We've got him. Yeah, but he's got her. All of you! Come out with your hands on your head. All of you come out with your hands on your head. We are armed police. It's all over. All of you come out with your hands on your head. It's your only chance. Keep moving forward. Come right away from the car. All good things come to an end. And the rest of you, come out of the car now. Out you go, love. Wait! Stay back. OWENS: Blackwell, put the gun down. We have you completely surrounded. Blackwell, you haven't got a chance. Now put that gun down. Do you hear me? You haven't got a chance. Then neither does she! Can we work a deal? Free passage out of the country! Put down the gun, Blackwell, and we'll talk about it. Not on on your life, ducky! It's free passage out of the country or she's dead! Blackwell, put down the gun! I told you, you don't have a chance. Blackwell, listen to me. I'll give you just 10 seconds to agree. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine-- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine-- [gunshot] [screams] Are you all right? - [sighs] I don't know. - You get into my car. Um, I don't think so. I think I'd rather walk. Don't you ever do anything the police tell you to do? That depends on what it is they tell me to do. Well, will you at least accept my thanks? Only if you'll except mine. I do. Goodbye. Goodbye. Are you sure you're all right? What are you doing in London? Uh, well, the police sent for me. Oh. And that's the real reason you came, because of the police? Ah, damn it. I'm-- I'm willing to give it a try if you are. A try? Yeah, a try. Yeah. But you said you came London for the police. You didn't come here to see me. That's what I tried to tell myself, even though I knew I was lying. You lie? Yes. I realized I love you. Oh. Well, maybe we ought to find a telephone. What for? Call the kids and tell them we're coming home. [music playing]
