Small children are left behind... The journey will be long, across the whole Ukraine, and sad. About Father's death. Sooner or later everyone takes this journey. This is one of those journeys that happen without our willing. It can be short, just a few steps, it can be long, thousands of kilometers, but still, it is equally hard. The telegram was like a verdict: Your father is dying, come at once. And here I am, on my way. I wish one never had to... But even though it's very hard, very difficult, the hope still lingers. Maybe, everything will turn out fine? Maybe... Father, probably during these days and nights of loneliness and sickness you have thought over your whole life. I will also remember everything on the road. I'll remember everything. Everything. From behind a rocky mountain Doves are flying I've never known any luxury while my years are passing Oh, go and harness horses, the raven-black horses And let us set out and chase the years of youth Do you remember those treks? It seems to me that it had never happened. That we have invented it all ourselves. Those roads, and the ox-cart trading, and our youth. Have we ever been young, huh? Have we? Of course! People are not born old! Son, you better run, invite old Lutsenko. Rich people don't need us and we don't need them. Let's drink, Sasha. The way things are now, we are not to sit together at one table with them anymore. All right, we need people to look after horses and cattle. Appoint me! And me! And me too! This won't do. You can't all work at a stable. You better tell us how are we going to manage the rains. Guys here have heard a song, but got it all wrong. When I was in the Navy I heard that they made a kind of button, and when you push it it rains cats and dogs. If it's true or not - that I don't know. It's not so easy. How'd it used to be? Well, one person had a small plot of wheat, getting ripe. And he didn't need rain. While the other had a plot with melons. Rain was most welcome there. You can't please everyone. If there was more rain in our parts, we'd have everything. And a dozen tractors. What can I say... The understanding of collective farming was naive almost idealistic, but full of high hopes for a happy future. Hello, Sasha! Are we having a meeting? Good evening. You've sent a plan impossible for me to fulfill. Have you decided to dispossess me? I guess we will, Mr Borys. Sasha, lad! How am I a wealthy peasant? Sasha, you know... What are you doing? You got rid of horses... Do you think you're equal with God? No, Sasha. God, he's far. You won't get him with your bare hands. Your God is so far that he's not there at all... People without God know nothing... and without land they're lazy... without their land, their own... They won't love it. They won't. The land will be ours, common to all and easier to work on together. Well, well... You'll take away my land and you'll work it better than me? We will. There will be tractors. The state will give all these super-phosphates... Never will anyone look after my land the way I do. Never. No one will love it the way I do. They will. Oh you... will they? You'll see, Sasha. Love for the land will vanish. The land will become barren and people will curse you. Sasha... What people? Are these people? We'll see who'll be cursed. The land will produce, have no doubts. It produced before you, and after you it will produce, and even better. It will keep producing year after year as maybe it has never done before. The land of our parents and grandparents, our greatest joy and pride, our dear land. And it seems that it hears everything, knows everything, contains everything. It also knows of your grief. Otherwise why would it be so solemnly quiet, contemplative, and melancholic, this land of yours? How he got his possessions - it is no business of ours. We have to be decisive when answering the question if he's a rich peasant to be dispossessed or not. Of course he is. He found that treasure during Nicholas's reign. If not us, then who? Together we dispossessed the Stepko, the Musienko and the Vedmid families. What about now? And now, Mr Oleksandr, are you going to support rich peasants? You know that I am not supporting rich peasants. I dispossessed the Stepko, the Musienko and the Vedmid families. While now... All our lives we've lived like good neighbours. In the hard years he used to help us out with wheat, he lent us a horse... He saved my wife in those times. Sasha, we have to. We need to go. There's nothing to be done. We need to go, that's it. We know well how he used to help you. As if you didn't slave hard to repay it! Should we erect a monument to honor him for saving your wife? Sasha, you came too? We came to dispossess you. I've dispossessed myself already. - What do you mean? Have you sold everything? - No! I have simply prepared myself for your visit. What do you think? That I don't see what's going to happen? I see everything, it's crystal clear to me. Your horses, cows, tools, all of it is here? Everything. Even the smallest thing. Here you go, these are the keys to the pantry, the basement, the barn. Let's go. No, I won't. Sasha, your father, Mr Mykyta, let him rest in peace, used to run away from the backyard when I was slaughtering a pig. While now, brother, this is more than a pig. This is about your whole life. Do you think that everyone will hand you the keys like that? That they will forgive you as I do? No, Sasha... They'll prepare a bullet for you instead of keys. Take care. You're begging for it. Remember that. New things in life always come with difficulty. And you, Father, many people didn't understand you back then. Lutsenko surely was among them. It was hard for you to dispossess him. Good evening, Ustya, dear. Come in. Our antichrist took down the icons again. I don't need icons to see God. /in Russian/ 'What causes fights and quarrels among you? Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it. Instead, you ought to say, ?If it is the Lord?s will, we will live and do this or that.? As it is, you boast of your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil. If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn?t do it, it is a sin for them. Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming to you. Your wealth has rotted... I was looking at Ustya, at her dark veil, and I was racking my brains what kind of wealth had to rot to cause Ustya so much grief. Andreev. If simply, Mr Stepan. If officially - a representative of the Party's Central Committee. Please, receive our guest! Oh please, not so solemnly! What do I need? A piece of bread and a bowl of beetroot soup for lunch. And in the morning - some water to wash myself. That's it. I can sleep on straw or near a stove. I'm not hard to please. Right, Cossack? We need to have a collective farm's board meeting and to estimate how much grain we can take from each collective farmer. Mostly wheat. And I will deal with the mid-level peasants, who haven't joined the collective farm yet. If we manage to convince them, Mr Oleksandr, we'll be half way done with our task. How should we feed our children? This is the same as it used to be: we are without bread, without anything... We have nothing! Children are starving. Please understand, workers in factories have nothing to eat. Who will work when hungry? Who will build? How should our state live without bread? We don't have enough cars, machines, tractors. At times we don't have them at all. What can one do in production shops without machines and in the fields without tractors? The only way out is to buy them from abroad with our bread. Our fathers and grandfathers ploughed with horses, sowed, thrashed grain. We'll get by without machines somehow. BREAD FOR PLANTS AND FACTORIES AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY FOR VILLAGES /in Russian/ Is it not written: ?My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations' But you have made... Ustya, don't come to us with your Bible. Don't perplex my family. There's nothing scary. See! Don't be afraid Never be afraid of anything! I tell my son not to be afraid, while I am in doubt. - You're talking about grain? - No, about land. Will they love it the way Borys Lutsenko loved it? They won't, Sasha. They won't. Not the way he did. And there's no need for it. This love can go to blazes! If owning a plot of land means constant toil and selling out one's brother... We are fighting such a love, Sasha. We set up collective farms to this end. You understand this yourself! Don't stand in one place! Run around! Go! He'll grow up and such doubts won't even occur to him! Oh you! While parents are still alive they stand on all of your roads. They wait for you and look out for you. Life is somehow organized in such a manner, that the longer we live the greater the distances that spread between us and our parents. It is frightening to think that no one is there. Only a vale is left, and unthinkable expanse of the world and life. THROUGH COOPERATIVES - TO SOCIALISM Comrades! We have done everything that we could to help our brother workers and their children during this hard winter. We have also helped the state with our bread. And this is the law. Because now it is impossible to live secluded in one's own house, in one's own yard. Now everyone and all of us are in charge of the whole country. If someone is experiencing tough times we will help them out of trouble. The whole collective farm will come to help. This is the source of our strength. If the state is in need, if such is a requirement of the political moment and economy, we give everything to our Motherland. We will give everything the way you, villagers, gave your bread! Deliver your bread, a present to the Motherland, and all the best in your lives! And once again, thank you comrades! At the time I didn't understand your elation, Father. And I regret this, and I envy you, even now, from the great distance of years and events. Because you were so proud then. I have never been able to be as proud, neither of my deeds nor of my friends. We're waiting for you. I see. Why are you frowning on such a sunny day? What happened? - People came from the town, brought us a new plan to fulfill. - An advanced one. It gives us no reason for merriment. Show it, Peter. Have a look. - Who brought it? - Pylyp Vukhatyi did. Him? Impossible! Not only will this plan leave our collective farm and people without bread, but who brought it? The son-in-law of a dispossessed person! Well, let's go... - Good afternoon - Hi I've heard that you came to collect grain for the State. Why so late? It was not easy for us here. You could've helped, if you had come in time. And now there's nothing left for you to do here. We've fulfilled the plan. We've just dispatched a red caravan to the station. So go to other villages, there's nothing for you to do here. How come? That's how. Take your plan and make yourself scarce! Do I make myself clear? - He is delegated by the Regional Party Committee. - And I am delegated... by the Central Committee. - That's it - No, it's not I am also delegated, - And I will insist... - Who are you? Maybe like Vukhatyi here, one of the former rich peasants? I represent the District Party Committee. - I fought during the Civil War... - Then you'll immediately leave this place I follow the directives here. So please, try banging your little fists at someone else. Do you understand? I am accountable here for everything to the Party and to the local people, and I will not stand your intrusion. Now this is really all. Goodbye. You will not get away with this. What should we do? Run things! They can shout at us as much as they want, bang their fists, but we need to work, complete our tasks. And even though the truth was on Andreev's side they managed to get their way. Because for them the most important thing was not a difficult and important case but their hurt pride. Just don't cry. Don't cry. No need for that. Do you hear me? Why have they taken him? I'm going there to help him out of the predicament. Maybe I'll manage to do something for him. And you, never cry! Never. Remember that. Whatever happens. I remembered our conversation for the rest of my life. And in the hardest moments when it was impossible to keep from crying I recalled your words and never cried. Oh, brother, you're all dressed up! But I called you here to work! And so I rushed. And I am ready to work with you at once. Not in such a suit! Sasha, we are to drive cattle to lands 200 km from here. So you need to change immediately. What cattle? No need to change! Well, you know, back then they... didn't keep me long. They've sent me here to set up a tractor depot. And my first official document was a telegram to you. So join in, we'll be together. Thank you. Handle me as you wish. I knew with whom I was dealing. This is how it should be. Never put your personal grudges above things of state importance. Andreev came to the village as if from the other world of which you dreamt, Father. Of which you heard from the greatest wonder of those times - a crystal radio receiver. You have loved Andreev as your brother. You still love him. It's a pity that due to your natural virtue and reserve you didn't tell him. He, however, surely felt it. Hey-ho! Where to? I felt neither dead nor alive among this bellowing, suffocating herd. And you were smiling... Do you see how beautiful the city is? Just look! Have a look. Life in the city is good. Right, girls? Maybe it is. Probably. There are no cows there. There's nothing for us to do there. And you smiled, while your eyes were very sad. Big cities and strange melodies haunted and lured you your whole life in the dreamlike silence of the steppe. All right. Dad, how did you know that there would be no rain? Rain? How did I know? What did I know? How did you know that there would be no rain? Ah... Well, listen. Rain falls here only from white, round clouds. Can you remember that? Only from white, round ones. Even if they are far away, they will come. This very wind will bring them, the south wind. That's a helluva wind! It blows so softly... as if whispering some tender words. That's the wind, the special wind. Your whole life, Father, you studied the sky as though reading a book. But back then I didn't understand what you were telling me about rains, winds and clouds. It seemed to me that the rains were falling on their own, while winds were blowing the way they wanted. Haven't you seen a tractor yet, really? - I was at school then. - Come on. Let's have a look Get in. There you go. Up a little, like that. Sit down. See here, a lever. And here - a gearbox. And what's that? For gasoline. Remember, Yurko, this thing will change our whole life. Hold on tight! Who will people curse now? Are they people even? A gang! What a gang! To deport everyone to Solovki! All of them should've been destroyed! And we were pampering them, we were sparing them! Whose are you? Fedora's maybe? Yes. My mother's name was Fedora. My goodness. You look old. But still, I recognized you. I'd recognize all of you. I've remembered you all, little rascals. You used to hang out on the threshing floor, always fiddling there. Hungry. Pallid. Skinny. And I used to scold you all the time, to shout at you until the moment the supervisors looked away. And then I would pour grain in your pockets. What you did with it afterwards I don't know... We fried it. You were also holding up your pockets, right? I was. I was pouring and putting the grain in your pockets and looking at you. I remember all of you. I remember Tolya Korol, he had very shallow pockets. Where is he now? He fell during the war. And Vasya Yudin, I used to pour him some grain too. He was as black as a beetle and all bones. I haven't seen him for a long time. Vasya shot himself during the occupation, in 1943. I see. I've forgotten everyone. And everyone else forgets us. Even our own children. I've been alone my entire life. Yes. Lonesome... When I am at my guard-post I reminisce about everything: about when I got married, the songs we used to sing, the trees, the melon fields we used to have. Oh, there used to be such fine melon fields! And the trees were high. People were beautiful. All of them were like my relatives... Why is that so? Huh? They were your peers, Grandma. And now everyone is younger than you, and all of your peers have died. I used to live for the sake of my children and to be virtuous for them. I should've behaved differently. The children grew up, each found a partner and now live on their own. And me, my entire life I've worked as a guard, recalling you all. Peter Kyyok often used to get it right in the neck. He was mean. As obstinate as his father. Where is Petro now? Fell at the Dniester river. What about Vitya Mytrofaniv? Blown up by a tank near Koenigsberg. How many of you have fallen, woe on me... Why have so many of you fallen? Such was the war, Grandma. Violent. As if you don't know... Violent? All of you went a really long way from the village, didn't you? And perished in places hard to pronounce and hard to remember. So that is why I dream of all of you when it's about to rain. Dead people come to dreams before the rain. Families, kin come and go, while the land stays for eternity. You can feel it best when you are in the steppe. And Father's death is perceived here without fear, without agitation and anxiety. Here you understand that death comes to everyone inevitably, when their time is due. Only not now, not this moment, not this one! My Father is not finished with his orchard yet, and I had no time to tell him the most important thing. The native village. The roots of your family and kin are here. Here Father spent his youth. Here he met Mother. And Uncle Yevtukh blessed them, so remarkably young and remarkably beautiful. But Uncle Yevtukh has not been with us for quite some time already, and no elders are left in your family. And you alone have to face what's in store for you. Maybe for this reason Father comes across as very lonely. Because his mother is no longer there, neither is his wife, nor Andreev. There's only you, and only you have to say something to him in this difficult deathbed moment. Wake up! Look who's come to see you. Well... Do you see who's come? No... I don't see. My voice. Do you recognize my voice? Voice, you say. It's a familiar voice. Oh my. What a familiar face. It reminds me of someone, but I'm not sure who. I know, it's hard for you, but I can't help you. It's nasty stuff. Be careful. Don't touch anything here, cause it will get on to you too. You drove all night? Well... not all. Yurko, my son. My oh my, you suffered all night. I didn't suffer. If only you got better. Mrs Lyubov can't come. She's at a surgery. That's fine. My most important doctor arrived. I need to give you an injection. The procedure will take time, meanwhile you can rest. Yes, it's scheduled for today. But I am better now. I want nothing more than for you to go home and to have some sleep. My boy, please go. Get some rest. You'll come back in the evening. Go see how things are, in the house and in the garden, where Mother used to walk. It's been two months since I left. Wife died May 1, 1950 Gave birth March 12, 1929 Planted 4 plums, planted 5 apples Planted 2 cherries, 1 pear, 1 black cherry August 1956 - renovation of the house 100 chickens June 8, smaller - June 21 Dad died January 23, 1934 Planted eggplants 16/IV Planted courgettes 26/IV Planted melon field on April 12 old style 2 pounds of wheat 2 pounds of corn... Saint-Germain-des-Pres... Such a beautiful name. Or Montmartre... Cyrano de Bergerac... Oh, hell... It's like pure music, it is. Those damn French... An interesting nation. We fought hungry, barefoot, barely clad. And later we also suffered, when rebuilding what was destroyed by the war and revolution. We had no mercy for anything, neither for us, nor for others. I have worked all my life, I was in a hurry, 24 hours were not enough for me. My time has come, I feel it. And the horses are without shoes. They watch me go. They wait for me to shoe them. But I guess this isn't to be. I feel bitter. This weight sits so heavily that I don't feel like dying when I consider all this, and think that I have no time to finish anything. You are my only hope. You'll remain among people. You'll do everything that I haven't managed to. Everyone thinks the same way about their sons. From behind a rocky mountain Doves are flying Are there clouds above the steppe? Yes, there are. Are they white and round? Yes, Dad, they're white, white and round. And the birds, are they flying over the windbreaks? Yes, they are, they're flying. Dad... We will not go back We will not go back We have no one to return to You had to appreciate us as your own health You had to appreciate us as your own health Yes. This is my home. Whatever happens to me, wherever my destiny takes me, my successes or my failures, my home was and still is this village of melon fields, my Bashtanka, an unremarkable village in the infinite valley. Be blessed and happy, my native home, my long-suffering Bashtanka, my steppe dove. I love you deeply as a son, and as long as I love you I'll be a human being. The End
