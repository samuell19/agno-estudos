Where'd you get the weed? ﻿I dunno, I know people, what does it matter? ﻿This doesn't feel right, Avishai. It's not mine. ﻿I promised him I wouldn't tell. ﻿Bro, you have my word. ﻿Avishai, you swear you'll only take the bottom branches. ﻿We promise. ﻿You go straight, all the way to the lake. ﻿There's a yellow rock, you know where it is? ﻿40-50 meters away, between the two trees, to the right. ﻿It's there. ﻿I feel bad for Shaul. ﻿I gotta check out that noise. ﻿No, let's go home, roll a joint, this place is full of jackals. ﻿That's not jackals. ﻿It's a pony. ﻿It's so cute! ﻿I don't think he's tied properly. ﻿Sonofabitch! ﻿You're such an ass, Avishai. ﻿Do you even know who Moses is, bringing up his name like that? ﻿The guy held the 10 commandments in his bare hands. ﻿All you ever held was a bong. ﻿Someone's at the door. ﻿Wait, I'll get you the money. ﻿Got anything to smoke? ﻿Sure thing. This way. ﻿Diet or no diet, I can put away 40 dumplings. No, man, just a small one. ﻿That is a small one. ﻿Another one, bro? ﻿Dude, you got money for the pizzas? ﻿What's that? -You got money for the pizzas? ﻿No. ﻿Tell him to put it on my tab. ﻿Say, who's that? ﻿That's Revital, what's with you? ﻿Not Revital, the one next to her. ﻿I'm so glad you're back! ﻿God, I missed you so much! ﻿Who's this? -My friend from Talpiot East. ﻿This is my friend Avishai. ﻿Nice to meet you, Gatprick. ﻿Avishai. ﻿You were in India? -Yeah, got back 2 days ago. ﻿Rami, can you come here a sec? ﻿Hava, what're you doing here? ﻿I just want to talk to you. ﻿What? ﻿Who's she? ﻿Listen, Hava, I'm glad you're here. ﻿But we talked about this. You think it's easy for me? ﻿I'm not trying to get rid of you, but we talked about it. ﻿We need to get used to it. ﻿It's not that I want to get used to it. ﻿I still care about you. ﻿But we're no good together. ﻿And if we're on the subject, ﻿I'm not into the abstinence thing anymore. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Yes, Rami, yes. ﻿Oh God. Oh God. ﻿Stop. ﻿You want me to stop? -No, no, no, don't stop. ﻿Don't stop. -Are you sure? ﻿Yes, I'm sure. ﻿India. ﻿Is just... ﻿India. ﻿It's another world. ﻿The colors, ﻿the smells, ﻿nothing but spirituality. ﻿None of that repulsive materialism that rules the world. ﻿Do you get what I'm saying ﻿I'm going to tell you things I learned there ﻿that not everyone can comprehend. ﻿For example... ﻿take that chair. ﻿You take it apart, you'll see it's made of the exact same particles ﻿that we're made of. ﻿All is one. ﻿Me and you, ﻿we're all part of something bigger, ﻿no boundaries, no time. ﻿No past, no future, only now. ﻿Sshhh... Close your eyes. ﻿Imagine an empty world, ﻿nothing material, only spiritual. ﻿Isn't it wonderful? ﻿Do you do LSD? ﻿Huh? ﻿Trips, acid. ﻿I've got a Hoffman. ﻿Want some? ﻿Avishai! ﻿You're dreaming! ﻿Get over here. ﻿Get in the goal. ﻿What's going on, Avishai? ﻿The semifinals are next week! Get a grip! ﻿I don't know, I'm distracted. ﻿I've been thinking about all kinds of things lately. ﻿What've you been thinking about? Tell me. ﻿It's like... ﻿Never mind, Tzvika. ﻿Talk to me. What am I here for? ﻿I mean... this isn't doing it for me. ﻿Is soccer all there is? ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿Don't you know the whole world revolves around this lousy ball? ﻿Why did Honduras go to war in 19... ﻿Yeah, but... what are we, after all? ﻿Take a chair. A chair. ﻿You take it apart, ﻿it's not a chair anymore, right? -Right. ﻿The same goes for us, you know? ﻿I mean, everything s... ﻿It doesn't really matter who'll win or lose. Rami! ﻿Get over here! ﻿What's up with Avishai? ﻿I don't know, he's acting weird. ﻿I'm acting weird? ﻿I hear you're tripping and all that shit, you're finished! ﻿What do you want from me? ﻿Why did you say I'm acting weird? ﻿Just because I'm looking for meaning in this tedious world? ﻿Tedious? Why tedious? ﻿Who put that crap in your head? That girl from yesterday? ﻿I saw you two together. ﻿It has nothing to do with Gatprick. ﻿Gatprick? -What's up with that name? ﻿Gatprick! ﻿It's the name she got in India ﻿when she was born again. ﻿Before the chair fell apart... ﻿There are a lot of temptations in this life. It's not easy, I know. ﻿There's cigarettes, drugs, whores, porn, ﻿internet, TV, beer, I know it's fun, ﻿I was young too. ﻿Kabesa. -What? ﻿Did you smoke grass today? ﻿Did you smoke or not? ﻿Yeah, but just a little. -It's not easy, is it. Rami! ﻿How was the party last night? ﻿Did you drink? Have a good time? ﻿Of course you did. By the way, thanks for the invite... ﻿I thought... -Valderama, what did you eat today? ﻿I had a steak. -A steak?! ﻿You asshole! A steak?! ﻿When?! It's barely 11:00! When did you put away a steak? ﻿What do you eat for lunch?! ﻿Have a piece of fruit, chop up a salad, man! ﻿Put in some nuts, some tahini, but go easy! ﻿From now on, no steaks, no chicks, no parties, only soccer. ﻿Whoever doesn't like it can get the fuck outta here! ﻿This year we're hosting the tournament. ﻿We'll reach the finals and we'll take home the cup. ﻿It's the chance of a lifetime. ﻿I hope they cut some Ashkenazim from the tournament. ﻿But Tzvika, I'm Ashkenazi. ﻿You're a nice Ashkenazi. ﻿Kids, come on in! ﻿Salvation is far from the wicked. ﻿I shouldn't have said what I said. ﻿He reacted nicely to your bullshit. ﻿Tzvika's smart. He knows what he's saying. ﻿Yeah, but I'm at the point where I either go forward ﻿or I crash. ﻿Forget it, you're coming off the acid... ﻿Take it easy. ﻿Stay home, drink some tea, smoke a bowl. ﻿Don't think so much, . you gotta take care of yourself. ﻿Dude, the old Avishai has to die. ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿I mean, in a spiritual way. ﻿Why d'you leave the door open? ﻿No way, I locked it. ﻿You can see the door's open, so why are you arguing? ﻿I dunno, could be. ﻿So you're Roni Cohen's brother. ﻿Fine lawyer, that Cohen, I spent a lot of money on him. ﻿How's his daughter? ﻿Dorit, right? ﻿Uh... Rakefet. -Right. ﻿Remember his villa? ﻿Sure ﻿Remember the garden? David and I built the whole thing. ﻿Spotlights, sprinklers, the works. ﻿Sit down already. ﻿You're making me uncomfortable. ﻿Look, I'm not the kinda guy who likes trouble. ﻿I've got my gardens, my peace and quiet, ﻿I'm not a kid anymore. ﻿Stunts, pranks, you do what you want, ﻿you're young, knock yourselves out, ﻿as long as it doesn't affect me. ﻿You made a 12 year old girl cry. ﻿Can you believe that, Cohen? ﻿Where's the pony? ﻿The pony? ﻿I'm sorry, Sagi, I didn't know it was yours. ﻿But it is mine, Cohen. ﻿Listen, it was an accident, the pony got loose. ﻿What about David's plant? ﻿Was that an accident too? ﻿How can I go to the Bat Mitzvah? ﻿You can't pay me enough for what you did. ﻿The whole family knows I'm bringing her a pony. ﻿Now I have to go in shame. ﻿I bought her a puzzle. ﻿It cost me 300 shekels. What do we do, Cohen? ﻿Listen, Sagi, we'll fix it. ﻿Let's settle it for 2000 shekels. ﻿Plus 300 hundred for the puzzle and 1000 for David's plant. ﻿Be at my place in 2 days with 3,300 shekels. ﻿Look at this place. ﻿I've been here 5 minutes and already I feel... filthy. ﻿I'll set you straight yet, Cohen. You'll see. ﻿You don't slaughter a sick sheep. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿No coffee, nothing. Not even a cookie. ﻿How could you not offer him a cup of coffee? ﻿Cohen! -What? ﻿These are your winnings for the quarter finals. ﻿There's good money on the semifinals. ﻿Ophir. -What? ﻿Any chance for a loan? ﻿Isn't about time you grew up already? ﻿All you do is smoke all day long. God forbid you should work. ﻿I work. -I'm talking about ﻿a real job. What are you waiting for? A miracle? ﻿There are no miracles in gambling. ﻿You made 10, next week you lose 100, you made 100, you lose 1000. ﻿Look at Avram over there. Avram, ﻿how much did you lose on the slots? ﻿How much did you lose at Black Jack? ﻿Millions, I could've bought a house, a villa, I could've had it all. ﻿He's been sitting at that machine for 2 days. ﻿It's like being in love with a woman with big tits. ﻿When he's done screwing a woman with tits like this, ﻿he'll jerk off to a woman with tits this big. ﻿So, what about a loan? ﻿What do you need a loan for, you messed up with loans now? ﻿Don't ask. We got in trouble. We took a plant. ﻿A plant? -By accident. ﻿Now we owe money to this guy from the neighborhood. ﻿What guy? ﻿Sagi Azoulay. -Ophir, eat shit, we're gonna shut this place down! ﻿Sagi Azoulay, the gardening guy? ﻿Forget about it, he's bad news, ﻿I don't want anything to do with him. ﻿Do you have any Bulgarian cheese? ﻿Yes. ﻿There's Bukharan cheese too. ﻿Is it low fat? ﻿Can't you tell she needs a diet? ﻿Mimi... -28%. ﻿So never mind. Can you just add some mushrooms? ﻿Watch out, it's contagious. Especially here at Piano. ﻿Pizza Piano, please hold. ﻿I want what she's having. ﻿No way, put it on my tab. -This is for both of us. ﻿Put it on my tab. -My treat, okay? ﻿Put it on my tab. ﻿Avishai, take this order. ﻿Piano. Yes. ﻿Hava, I have to talk to you. ﻿I hate bringing this up, ﻿but Avishai owes a ton of money. -For real? ﻿Yeah, let's just say we might get beaten up real soon. ﻿You too? ﻿What can I do? He's my friend. ﻿How much do you need? ﻿3000 shekels. ﻿Where am I going to get 3000 shekels? ﻿Come on, your father could buy -this whole neighborhood! What d'you say? ﻿This is all I have. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Sagi wants to see you. ﻿Not now, in half an hour. ﻿Tzvika, it's Kadosh! ﻿No offense, but the 'Soccer Field Stars' aren't a serious team. ﻿I'm not worried about the finals, even though they're hosting them. ﻿Everyone knows some of those guys take drugs ﻿and a real coach wouldn't let a junkie play on his team, ﻿or players who are overweight. ﻿So how did they make it to the semifinals? ﻿Even a blind chicken... ﻿Screw him. ﻿I don't give a rat's ass about him. ﻿I got the recipe from my mom. ﻿Here. What is it, Avishai? Talk to me. ﻿I feel bad. ﻿What is it? ﻿I wanted to talk to you but... ﻿I feel bad asking for help. ﻿I'll help you. ﻿What happened? ﻿We need a loan. ﻿Money? ﻿You know, rent and stuff. ﻿You can crash here for a night or two. ﻿Avishai, what about your job? ﻿Can't that cheapskate Shlomi help you out? ﻿He makes him work his ass off. ﻿And he says I owe him 80 shekels ﻿for the pizza you ate after the game. ﻿What? I only had a slice and a half. ﻿And it's unhealthy, too. ﻿Can't you lend us 300, 500 shekels? Well pay you back on Sunday. ﻿I don't have any money on me. ﻿Look, only Euros! ﻿Euros will do. ﻿Where will you exchange it? ﻿Don't worry about it. ﻿Avishai, what's the Euro rate today? ﻿Six, I think. ﻿Cool, how much do you have here, 250? ﻿I'll tell you exactly how much it is. I'll give you a receipt. ﻿Okay, eat up, the food's getting cold. ﻿Well? ﻿I made it. ﻿"Sagi Azoulay Gardening and Pest Control" ﻿You should see it at night, ﻿when it's dark. ﻿So, you got to the semifinals? ﻿Yeah, we won 4-2. ﻿What d'you think about the team? ﻿The seasoning's good but the chicken's rotten. ﻿It's not what it used to be. ﻿Okay, Cohen, where's the money? ﻿Look, Sagi, ﻿we tried, but... we ran into some problems. ﻿What's this, Cohen, you open a bank? ﻿I don't take a shekel here, a shekel there. ﻿We'll get you the rest next week. ﻿You need another week, you got it. ﻿Really? -Sure. ﻿It's in my interest to lend you money. ﻿I'll even give you till Friday. ﻿Listen, ﻿I usually take 10 percent a week, ﻿but because of your brother, Roni, I'll give it to you for... ﻿Seven... no, five percent. ﻿Sounds reasonable. ﻿And another thing. When you come with the money, ﻿Cohen brings me a pot of his mom's beet dumplings. ﻿Sure thing. -Cohen, loosen up. ﻿I'm joking ﻿He's not like his brother, he doesn't get a joke. ﻿And I have to live with him. ﻿You know... ﻿You'd look good with a thin moustache, ﻿like an Iraqi's. ﻿Cohen, do me a favor, I'm thirsty. ﻿I got some Stolichnaya in the freezer, get us three glasses. ﻿You played pretty good. -I did? ﻿Believe me, I got nostalgic, watching you play. ﻿I miss the ball, I miss Tzvika. ﻿He's a hard-ass, Tzvika. ﻿Those were the good old days. ﻿Watching us play was better than watching a movie. ﻿And Tzvika still had all of his blond hair. ﻿You're dripping all over my house. ﻿Did you know Sagi played with Tzvika and Kadosh? ﻿Such a degenerate, that Kadosh. ﻿Opening his mouth is one thing, but the filth that came out? ﻿If Tzvika got half the funding he gets... ﻿But who can afford it? ﻿Only Ashkenazim and contractors. ﻿Your brother, Cohen, he used to fight them. ﻿What an angel, that Roni Cohen. ﻿The mind of a Cohen, the balls of an ostrich. ﻿May God avenge him. ﻿Damn those Arabs. ﻿I gotta sit here, in my own home ﻿and hear their stinkin' Muezzin screaming every morning, ﻿and the gunshots at their weddings... ﻿Double glaze, insulation, I tried everything. ﻿And I'm one of those guys who wants peace. ﻿Cheers. ﻿And just to be clear, ﻿until you pay me back, I own you. ﻿We'll get a kilo from Yair, 1400 shekels is a great price. ﻿We unload it, and by Friday it's all over! ﻿Listen, when I opened the freezer to get the vodka, ﻿I saw a finger inside. ﻿A frozen finger, a human finger. ﻿A finger? What are you talking about? ﻿I saw a finger! ﻿All the acid you dropped, no wonder you saw a finger. ﻿You must be hallucinating, don't take it so hard. What about Yair? ﻿No way! Deep, deep. -I'll sell that kilo in a second! ﻿Shawn, Ophir, Adi, Shalom, Shetz, Amir. ﻿I don't get you. -Forget it, man, I'll work double shifts. ﻿I don't wanna be a drug dealer. ﻿A drug dealer? It's weed. We buy it for our friends all the time. ﻿No, it's the semifinals, I don't wanna get into that shit. ﻿On the contrary, you'll have more time to practice, you won't have to work. ﻿Rami! Everyone facing Jerusalem. ﻿In threes. Let's go. ﻿Come on, line up, yes. Hup, hup, hup, hup. ﻿What's your problem? We'll get some grass, smoke it, sell it. ﻿It's a great idea. What's with you? ﻿You know what, you do it. ﻿I don't wanna do it alone. ﻿And I'm not going to Sagi either, I hope he cuts off your finger off. ﻿You wanna work at Piano your whole life? ﻿Making pizzas like a loser? ﻿Avishai, it's not that big a deal. ﻿My ex-boyfriend used to buy 5 or 6 kilos all the time. ﻿How much is he paying you an hour? 18 shekels? ﻿100 shekels a day? That barely covers our cigarettes. ﻿And we're almost out of weed as it is. ﻿Think about it, we buy one kilo, sell it. ﻿That's 5000 shekels in our pockets! And we're all set! ﻿Plus we can smoke all the weed we want. ﻿Think about it. A kilo. ﻿If you don't want to, we won't do this, man. ﻿Everything okay? ﻿Gimme the money, I wanna count it. ﻿Are you nuts? What's with the dollar bills? ﻿It's Euros, it's times 6 and a half. It's all there. ﻿It's 1,550, it's even a bit more. ﻿Where the hell am I going to change this? ﻿You see that green dumpster? ﻿There's a kilo inside. ﻿No, Yair, no way, bring it over here. ﻿Have I ever taken you for a ride? ﻿What's with the bullshit, Rami? ﻿Motherfucker, if he screwed us, I'll stab him. Gross! Avishai, how can you live with him? ﻿Shut up, Haim, why're you provoking him? ﻿Shit, man, I asked you not to scratch here, what the hell! ﻿It itches, you want me to leave the room and scratch myself? ﻿Gross! ﻿I used to be like you. ﻿It's addicting, like a drug. ﻿You don't take care of it, it'll spread to your dick. Amen! ﻿Why are you saying that? -Because. ﻿This is David. ﻿He'll be staying here for a few days. ﻿If you need anything, you ask them. ﻿What for? You just put one out. ﻿You're right, Sagi. -Your lungs are shot. ﻿Take care of him for me. ﻿Ciao, Sagi. ﻿It's 250, but it's dynamite weed. ﻿Cool. ﻿I was desperate, man. ﻿I put some Araq in the bong and smoked it with tobacco. ﻿Rami, I thought you'd come alone. ﻿What's up? ﻿What's doin'? How's your mom? ﻿Fine. -You good? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Neta, get off the porcupine before you fall! ﻿Fucking kid. ﻿What's up? ﻿Two? Cool. I'll be right there. ﻿What's that? You buy a new cellphone? ﻿It was on sale. ﻿On sale? ﻿I'm not saying, don't smoke, just cut down. ﻿You smoke 10 bowls a day? ﻿Cut it down to four, three. ﻿Slowly, do it gradually. ﻿Gimme your hat, I wanna smoke a bong with it. ﻿There's Amir. -Amir! ﻿Step on it, Avishai! ﻿Get outta here! ﻿The Chabna brothers wanna kill me!! ﻿Step on it! Go, go, go!!! ﻿Avishai, step on it! Faster! ﻿Amir, Amir! -Ouch! ﻿Look, look... it's Yaniv Chabna... ﻿You asshole junkie... ﻿Lucky he jumped out. ﻿They would have killed us. ﻿I can't treat you like this. ﻿Don't you see he doesn't give a shit about you? ﻿He's like that sometimes, but... ﻿But what? He's an egotist. ﻿It's bad energy, Avishai. ﻿You know something, Mimi? ﻿I always knew you'd be the only one for me. ﻿I'm so glad we got back together. ﻿Me too. ﻿My mom will go nuts when I tell her. ﻿Oh my God! -Sorry. ﻿I fell asleep. ﻿Close your eyes. ﻿What are you doing? Voodoo? ﻿You really are thick, aren't you? Like cement. ﻿Don't patronize me. ﻿Get the fuck out, bible-freak. ﻿You're telling me to get out? ﻿Why, is this your house, you baboon? ﻿Tell that to your mother. Slut. ﻿Don't you dare call me a slut, you scumbag. ﻿Hey, guys... ﻿Avishai, tell your girlfriend to watch her mouth. ﻿Hey, what is this? It's so not cool. ﻿Okay, I'm leaving. ﻿Yeah, you do that. Go back to India, eagle-beak. ﻿No one ever talked to me like that. ﻿Idol worshipper. -Come on, Gatprick, don't go. ﻿Nature's calling. ﻿Rami, what are you doing? ﻿You idiot, it's for your own good. -Right. ﻿Do I complain when you bring all your girlfriends around? ﻿What girlfriends, asshole? ﻿Can't keep your mouth shut, can you? ﻿You guys are good friends, why argue? ﻿True friends are hard to find. ﻿I had lots of friends, girlfriends, ﻿look at me now. ﻿You guys are young, healthy, you dance, people see you on TV. ﻿You don't say things like that to a friend. ﻿If I ever see you with another woman, I'll die. ﻿God forbid, don't listen to him. ﻿I'll die. ﻿Hava, it's all bullshit! ﻿Rami, this isn't working. ﻿You've changed since I met you. ﻿Hava, come on, you're my angel, ﻿my beautiful angel. ﻿You have to start taking yourself seriously. ﻿Mimi, you're wasting your life. ﻿Hava, what do you want? ﻿I want us to work on our relationship. ﻿Work? ﻿We'll take classes, go for walks, listen to one another, ﻿you'll meet Mom. ﻿She's dying to meet you. ﻿You taste like salt. ﻿You stink like cigarettes. ﻿How about brushing your teeth? ﻿Listen, dude, I wanted to talk to you about something. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Rami, I can't put it. on your tab anymore. ﻿Give the change to charity. ﻿Moshik, gimme a ride. -Don't want to. ﻿Gimme a ride! -No! What're you gonna do? ﻿Did you see that little shit? ﻿"It's for your own good. Kisses." ﻿Gimme a cigarette. ﻿I'm listening. ﻿Listen, I know you're not crazy about Gatprick, ﻿her being over so often, using your blow dryer... ﻿Gimme a light. ﻿Here's the thing, I've been thinking... ﻿We always gave one another space, ﻿and let's say, if you're with a girl... -Yeah? ﻿Forget it, you know what? I don't want to hurt your feelings. ﻿I know you won't get hurt, you shouldn't, ﻿but, like... shit! ﻿Avishai, what the fuck?! It's a new shirt! ﻿Sorry, I wasn't paying attention... ﻿Of course you weren't! You never pay attention! ﻿Don't think I'm not paying attention. ﻿I'm proud of you, Valderama. ﻿What's this? Amir, wake up. ﻿Amir! What is this? ﻿A circle. -It's a ball! ﻿A ball and a foot! ﻿Today you either kick this or this. Preferably this, okay? ! ﻿Hey, David. -Hi, Tzvika. ﻿What's up? Long time no see. ﻿Thanks for coming. -I brought you something. ﻿Let's see. ﻿"Soccer Field Stars" ﻿"Sagi Gardening and Pest Control" ﻿Leeds United, Tzvika. ﻿What's with the advertising? ﻿Get it outta here. ﻿But Sagi said... -Tzvika says ﻿that on this field everything needs my approval, tell Sagi. ﻿But Tzvika, shall the sword devour forever? ﻿Not another word. ﻿Nice moustache, Rahamim. ﻿Technical win or not, we won. ﻿Move outta the way!! ﻿We won, that's what matters. ﻿God willing, ’-well bring the trophy home. ﻿This is a clip from an interview with coach Kadosh of the Lions, ﻿who you'll be meeting at the finals. ﻿Everyone knows they have a drug problem, ﻿a real coach wouldn't keep a junkie on his team, ﻿or overweight players. ﻿I prefer not to comment. ﻿Are the rumors true about your not so friendly past? ﻿This is a new era, please, • - let's not ruin it. ﻿Okay, Tzvika, thank you... -Thank you. ﻿Tzvika, what's the deal with Kadosh? -They say, ﻿if you eat pork, don't let the fat dribble on your beard. ﻿Tell me. -Leave it alone. ﻿Why? It's interesting. ﻿You coming? ﻿Where to? ﻿For our walk. -A walk? Just finished a game, I'm beat! ﻿But you said we'd go for a walk on Tuesday. ﻿I wanna be with my friends, we're celebrating our victory. ﻿Fine. ﻿Ten minutes, then. ﻿Avishai, get over here, I need your help. ﻿He makes you work on your day off too? ﻿Ugh, that's really bothering me. ﻿What is it Shiomi? ﻿I need you to unclog the sink. ﻿I don't feel like it, okay? -What did you say? ﻿What do I pay you for? ﻿Get it over with, it's no big deal. ﻿I'm sick of your bullshit, I don't work here anymore. ﻿You don't, huh? No problem. ﻿You dwarf. ﻿You're not getting last week's pay ﻿and you owe me 80 shekels. ﻿Here's your 80 shekels. ﻿Cheapskate. ﻿Don't forget who taught you how to make pizzas. ﻿Shove your pizzas up your ass, who do you think you are? ﻿You're nothing but a lousy pizza man. ﻿Avishai. ﻿You got a phone call. ﻿A phone call? ﻿A phone call. ﻿What? -Who is this, Avishai? -Yes. ﻿What? -I want a life sentence for what I'm gonna do to you. ﻿Huh? 'Who is this? ﻿Yaniv Chabna. ﻿Yaniv, sorry, what's up, man? ﻿You motherfucker, I'm gonna fuck you good! ﻿I'm watching you, you fuck! ﻿Tell your mother you're going on vacation, you fuck! ﻿You played with my Ortal? I'm gonna fuck you, Avishai! ﻿Yaniv, what are you talking about? I don't know any Ortal. ﻿You don't?. * ﻿What about that bracelet you got her? ﻿Huh?! ﻿Start counting the minutes, you fuck! ﻿Have you seen Gatprick? ﻿Listen, Avishai, ﻿love knows no rules. ﻿It's better this way. ﻿I knew from the start - that one's like a cat. ﻿You pamper a cat, you pet it, ﻿roll around with it, on the rug, the kitchen floor, ﻿in the end, it shows you its ass. ﻿I also think she swiped a few bags of grass. ﻿Mimi, come on, just a little further. ﻿Give me 5 minutes. ﻿Okay, 5 minutes, then we continue. ﻿It's the cigarettes. ﻿Yeah, I gotta quit. ﻿Like I haven't heard that before. ﻿In our home you'll smoke on the balcony. ﻿Oh yeah. ﻿And if we ever decide to start a family, ﻿I don't want my children... -Listen, Hava, ﻿I've been thinking about it. ﻿I'm not ready for a serious relationship right now. ﻿What? ﻿Mimi, what do you mean? ﻿Hava, you're a great girl, ﻿but this isn't working. ﻿How dare you?! ﻿I gave you my body! ﻿Sorry. ﻿Today you'll practice kicking the ball into the goal. ﻿Why aren't you kicking the ball into the goal? ﻿Because Avishai doesn't give a crap about you! ﻿Where the hell's Avishai? ﻿What haven't I done for you. ﻿I gave him money! ﻿The guy owes me 250 Euros, that piece of shit. ﻿Rami, where's Avishai? ﻿He's not feeling so good... ﻿I'm fed up with this bullshit. This game is personal. ﻿If I don't beat Kadosh, here, in my own neighborhood, ﻿there's no point showing up for the game. ﻿What am I asking? ﻿A baby? It's only practice. -Is this the dance class? ﻿Sagi...| what are you doing here? ﻿Semifinals, eh? Congratulations. ﻿Did you know your coach was a star around here? ﻿Oh, come on. -A star. ﻿Maybe a little star. ﻿Better a little golden star than a big plastic star. ﻿This is for the kids. ﻿No, they don't eat during practice. ﻿You don't wanna take from me? ﻿They don't deserve it. ﻿Is the community center's money any better? ﻿You know how much money Orion spilled over them? ﻿I never touched their money or their food. ﻿And I fed thousands just like them. ﻿Never mind that now, there were good days too. ﻿There were. ﻿At least that. ﻿Good luck, guys. ﻿Okay, I haven't forgotten about you. Come on. ﻿I'm gonna tear your assholes open. ﻿Hup, hup, hup, hup. ﻿I'll rip open your asses, ﻿hup, hup. ﻿Sonofabitch. ﻿Stretch, stretch. ﻿Hup, hup, hup. ﻿Go! Rami! ﻿Hello there, ﻿can I offer you Bible lessons on tape? ﻿No, I'm not interested, thank you. ﻿Let me tell you about them. -No, I'm not interested, thanks. ﻿Aren't you Jewish? ﻿Sure I am, I just don't... I﻿'m not sure it's right for me, okay? ﻿How can you be so sure? ﻿Because... I have my own way of seeing things. ﻿You do? I'd like to hear about it. Maybe I'll learn something. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Could I bother you for a cup of tea? ﻿Where's Cohen? ﻿He doesn't feel well. -What's wrong with him? ﻿Nothing. Bronchitis. ﻿Really? Tell him to rub some Araq on his throat. ﻿Nice. I didn't expect Cohen to come through. Or you. ﻿Nice shirts you made. ﻿That Tzvika is stubborn. ﻿Married to the community center. ﻿Did you see we made it to the finals? ﻿That's not making it. ﻿We used to practice in the rain, the snow. ﻿What snow? ﻿The snow of '84. ﻿Okay, if we're done here... ﻿Actually, I've been giving this some thought. ﻿I got a great lead on a deal. The neighborhood's totally dry. ﻿What are you talking about? Drugs? -No. ﻿Grass. ﻿Everyone smokes grass these days. ﻿Grass... In my day you could buy it at the grocer's. Big deal. ﻿We'll discuss it some other time. -The time is now. ﻿Right now, there's a dry spell! We gotta strike while the iron's hot. ﻿I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand, Sagi. ﻿I know who has it, who doesn't, who's dealing, who isn't. ﻿You threw an idea out there, let it sink in. ﻿That's the thing, this dry spell could be over in a second. ﻿Now's the time, if not, we might miss out. ﻿- Thank you, thank you very much. -Stop it, come on... ﻿Okay, if we're done here... My nephews will be here any second. ﻿We'll be done in a moment. ﻿Listen, Sagi, I did the math. ﻿I got an amazing lead, lethal grass for 1400 shekels, ﻿no seeds, full of buds and oil, with little red hairs on it, ﻿I'll sell it in a second, Sagi. -Hold on a second, shut up. ﻿You're saying one kilo is 1400, divided by 20, ﻿multiplied by 250, ﻿plus 10 percent, ﻿say 6-7 kilos? That's around 10,000 shekels. ﻿Yeah, something like that. ﻿I'll give it to you for 8 percent. ﻿Last time it was 5. ﻿Last time it was a lot less money. ﻿Know your limitations. ﻿And tell Cohen, bronchitis or not, ﻿next week you're both here with the money. ﻿And that moustache... ﻿Goodbye. ﻿There's no such thing as past or future. ﻿Everything is in our minds now. ﻿We create time, see, ﻿I mean, only the present exists for sure. ﻿There's the past, there's the future and there's the present. ﻿What you did in the past is related to who you are today. ﻿If you take this glass and drop it on the floor, ﻿it'll have an impact on the future. ﻿That's the result of what happened in the past. ﻿Fine, but the past is only an idea in the present. ﻿What about now? This moment? ﻿That's what really matters. -Right, the moment is what matters, ﻿it's what impacts the future. ﻿You seem so smart and gentle. You're a Cohen (priest), right? ﻿What? You can tell? ﻿No, man, it says on your door. ﻿A Cohen shall not be impure. ﻿Impurity causes sadness, a Cohen must not be sad. ﻿He's the pipeline between God and Israel. ﻿You're alive, be happy! ﻿You were fired, be happy! ﻿Your girlfriend left you, be even happier! ﻿Everything that happens is for the best, ﻿but we must also make an effort for Him. ﻿What do we do all day? ﻿We eat, sleep, watch TV, ﻿what kind of life is that? ﻿Is that what you came into this world for? Is that what life's about? ﻿How do you differ from an animal? ﻿What's the difference? ﻿I'll tell you what the difference is. ﻿You have the mind to choose between good and evil. ﻿You speak and express your soul. ﻿It pains me to see young Jews like you so confused. ﻿Soul searching in all kinds of places, following senseless paths. ﻿Paths paved by idolaters! When the truth is right here! ﻿What's with you? Aren't you a Jew?! ﻿As long as the candle burns, anything can be amended. ﻿Your evil inclination is trying to thwart you. ﻿It wants you to be sad, don't let it! ﻿Be strong, and more important, do not fear at all. ﻿Take this book, it'll do you good. ﻿No. -Don't say no," it's a gift from me. ﻿It'll open your eyes, I care about you, man. I don't know why. ﻿For free? No, I couldn't. ﻿So give me 5 shekels for charity, it doesn't matter. ﻿5 shekels. -Give me 10 shekels, 20 shekels, 50, ﻿what's the difference? You'll reap the rewards. ﻿Come to synagogue with me today. ﻿It's the Sabbath, dress up nicely, pray with me. ﻿You know what, I might just do that. Well see. ﻿May God bless you and protect you, ﻿May God's face give light to you and show you favor, ﻿May God's face be lifted toward you and bestow upon you peace, ﻿for He shall command His angels to guard you on all your paths. Say Amen. ﻿Amen. -Say Amen! -Amen! ﻿Give me a hug. ﻿An angel is watching over you. ﻿If you love God and observe His commandments, ﻿you have nothing to fear. I'll be waiting for you, Cohen. ﻿Hava, what are you doing here? ﻿I got two stripes. ﻿What stripes? ﻿Two stripes, on the test. ﻿What test? ﻿The test I told you... ﻿Hava, calm down, look at me. What happened? ﻿I'm pregnant. ﻿What?! Are you sure? ﻿Listen, we'll get through this, I promise you, don't worry. ﻿Really? -Yes, it'll be fine. ﻿Don't worry about the money either... ﻿Well get an abortion, it'll be okay. ﻿An abortion! God forbid! You think I'd murder our child?! ﻿How do I even know it's mine? ﻿Hava, no way, I won't have it, ﻿I'm not having a kid now. ﻿I am, you murderer. ﻿That's too bad. I don't want anything to do with it. ﻿He'll be fucked up coz he won't have a father. ﻿With God's help he'll be healthy and you'll be a good father. ﻿In 9 months I'll drop by your parents with a little surprise. ﻿You'll take responsibility for your actions. ﻿How dare you talk to me like that?! ﻿Don't talk to me ever again! ﻿How d'you know she's pregnant? -She did the test. ﻿Did you see the test? ﻿No, that's what she told me. ﻿Then tell her to do a blood test. ﻿I think you should go with her, to see for yourself. ﻿Don't be afraid of anything. ﻿You're right. ﻿So? Ortal Buchacho, huh? -Shit... ﻿Yaniv Chabna's girl. -Doesn't it seem weird to you? ﻿Not really. She camped out here, smoked all our grass. ﻿As soon as I saw her I knew she was a whore. ﻿She's not a whore? -She's not a whore? ﻿She's a total whore. ﻿Why are you all dressed up? You going to a Bar Mitzvah? ﻿I'm going to synagogue. ﻿Come with me, say a prayer for the baby. ﻿Well well... Good for you, Avishai. ﻿Good Sabbath, David. ﻿Good Sabbath. ﻿Be happy. A kid is a cute thing. ﻿You hug it, kiss it, play with it, ﻿take it to soccer games, teach it to dance... ﻿I wish I had a kid. ﻿I do have a kid... ﻿In Frankfurt. ﻿Why?! Why, you motherfucker?! ﻿Yaniv, not the legs. ﻿Get me the sack. ﻿That's the way to do it, dry punches that penetrate deep, ﻿deep into the bones. ﻿Motherfuckin' sonofabitch. ﻿What happened?! ﻿David, get some ice. ﻿Bro, what happened? ﻿Shit, look at your clothes. ﻿Light me a bong, Rami. ﻿Chabna, that bastard. ﻿This spirituality thing's not for me. ﻿What is that? ﻿It's HD! ﻿Good news. Sagi loaned us 10,000 shekels, ﻿we buy 6 kilos, sell it in no time, ﻿then sit back and relax, watch DVD, drink Jack Daniels... I worked it all out with Yair. ﻿Hi Yair, what's up? -What's up? ﻿Hey, Avishai, did you just fart? ﻿No! ﻿Make a U-turn. ﻿Where we going? -Lod. ﻿No way, Yair, I'm not going to Lod. ﻿You guys want drugs or not? ﻿Where do you think I got 'em last time, the playground? ﻿Step on it, man, I'll pay for the gas. -That's not the issue. ﻿I got a great fuckin' lead in Lod! We're back here in an hour. ﻿Go on, it's cheaper, too. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Put this in. ﻿Is this even the right direction? ﻿I don't know, man. ﻿Where's George? -What d'you want? ﻿I need George! -What do you need? Green? Brown? LSD? ﻿I said I need George! ﻿Let's get outta here, Avishai. ﻿It's their territory, there's nothing I can do. ﻿Sonofabitch! ﻿Hello. ﻿What's up? Everything okay? ﻿How are you? -Thank God. ﻿Damn these Jews... ﻿Them and the Druze. ﻿My stomach is killing me... ﻿Hey, man. -Hey, how are you? ﻿Say, who's the new Jew? He looks like a cop. ﻿Don't worry. He's nobody. ﻿What can I get you? Green, brown, LSD, Hoffman? ﻿Ecstasy, Mitsubishi, just in, grade A Mitsubishi. ﻿"Hava: I have a blood test tomorrow at 10 a.m" ﻿Give us 6 kilo green, two white and a Hoffman. ﻿What, no Mitsubishi? ﻿I'm tellin' you it's good. I just took two. ﻿Okay, gimme some Mitsubishi. You want some too? ﻿Sure. ﻿How 'bout Persian coke? ﻿No, I don't touch the stuff. I'm a 21 st century junkie. ﻿Gimme 7500 and the Mitsubishi's on me. ﻿Listen, bring 6 kilo... ﻿But Ali told me to give them... ﻿I don't care what Ali said, go get it now! ﻿Ali, he tells me. Fuck you and fuck Ali! ﻿Fucking Ali! ﻿Very good grass, the best. ﻿Take a whiff. ﻿Give me a ride. ﻿Why so scared? Just a short ride. ﻿This is us, this is your car. Is it for sale? ﻿No. -Okay. ﻿These are undercover cops. ﻿This is a fortress, don't go in there. ﻿Take a left here, through the fountain, ﻿Undercover cops too, watch out. ﻿Make a run for it, if anyone jumps you, ﻿toss the bags, swallow the Mitsubishi, ﻿you got that? ﻿Get outta here. ﻿Open up, Avishai, open up, motherfucker! ﻿Step on it! ﻿Slap me. ﻿What? ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿I came to apologize for kicking your ass, ﻿even though you deserved it, you motherfucker. ﻿Now slap me. ﻿Slap him. ﻿So... Are we good? ﻿Just so you know, the family put money on the finals, ﻿don't screw it up. ﻿Hey. -Hi. ﻿When's the appointment? ﻿In 5 minutes. ﻿''So how are you? ﻿Okay. ﻿How long before we get ﻿Nine months... ﻿24 hours. You coming? ﻿Hello. What? ﻿What d'you mean "shwag" ﻿I don't know what to say. ﻿Your shwag brought me down in the middle of the party. ﻿You think I was born yesterday? ﻿Sell this to your friends. -Why? ﻿Why? ﻿It's not what we discussed. ﻿You can't even get arrested for shit like this. ﻿Rami, you wanna bum me out? ﻿There hasn't been shwag this bad in Jerusalem for years. ﻿I'm not buying this. ﻿If you don't tell Sagi, ﻿I will. ﻿I don't like it looking at me. ﻿You ready for the finals? ﻿Tzvika's tough, huh? ﻿Stubborn. ﻿You guys remind me of days gone by. ﻿Tzvika, David, Kadosh the sonofabitch and Orion. ﻿You know who Orion is. ﻿No. ﻿You don't know Orion? He had a club. -No. ﻿How can you not know Orion? ﻿What's the story with Kadosh? ﻿He's scum. He ruined the neighborhood. ﻿Anywhere else, he'd be dead. -Why? ﻿Never mind. ﻿Tell us, we wanna know. We lost 3-2. ﻿We're in this village, ﻿only Arabs. ﻿And it's hot, ﻿I was dying of thirst. ﻿And where's Kadosh? Disappeared. ﻿Orion said go to the locker room, make sure he wasn't abducted. ﻿Tzvika felt sick, he had a feeling. ﻿So we head to the locker room to see if he's there. ﻿Then... I hear a strange sound. ﻿Shrill, like a crow, ﻿but not exactly a crow. ﻿More like a mouse. ﻿We get closer, ﻿and what do I see? ﻿Kadosh, that bastard, giving it to their captain up the ass. ﻿It's not enough they scored three goals, ﻿he had to score another goal with the Arab. ﻿Did Chabna junior pay you a visit? ﻿Yes. -Was he polite? ﻿Yes. ﻿Did you slap him? ﻿Yes. -You have your brother to thank for that, ﻿but don't count on him anymore. ﻿Did the Araq help? ﻿What Araq? -The bronchitis. Did it help? ﻿Bronchitis? ﻿Okay, what's with the money? ﻿We almost had all the money, but... ﻿People didn't want it because the grass was... ﻿Shwag. -It sucked. ﻿We were had. -They screwed us over. ﻿My girlfriend got pregnant. ﻿We'll get it, for sure. -I got in trouble, Sagi, ﻿It'll take sometime. -Sagi, I'm gonna be a father. ﻿Well start working and get the money. ﻿You? ﻿Work? ﻿It pains me. ﻿It pains me that you're lying to yourselves! ﻿I raped boys like you in jail! ﻿This is making me sick. ﻿One hour and you're a goner, Cohen, one hour. ﻿I'm not going back again. ﻿Mom, I'm never going back. Never! ﻿Now I wanna see what you're doing with my money. ﻿Amir. ﻿Amir! ﻿It stinks in here. -Amir.' ﻿Disgusting. ﻿Amir! ﻿Sorry, Tzvika. Wow, what a surprise. ﻿Avishai, make some coffee. ﻿Where's Yair? ﻿Shaul says he's in New York, he took us for some big bucks. ﻿New York? He's in jail. ﻿He got jumped, he had 2 grams of white and a Mitsubishi. ﻿And he was trippin' on Hoffman. ﻿Any way we can talk to him? ﻿Maybe in a week or two ﻿he'll be released. In the meantime, I'm watching his gun. ﻿You want this? I don't need it. I'm throwing it away. ﻿What is it? -Mitsubishi. ﻿Ecstasy? Sure. ﻿Throw it away? You nuts? ﻿Is this it? Is it all like this? ﻿Yes. ﻿You see? This is the male. ﻿This is what you don't buy. ﻿Get me some "Raid" from your bathroom. ﻿Thanks. ﻿If I wanted so much sugar, I would've asked for tea. Move. Move ﻿That's it. Now it's good. ﻿In 2 days you come by with all my money. Goodbye. ﻿I'm not smoking that. ﻿Well? ﻿It's awesome. I'm floating. ﻿"Hava" ﻿Hello. -Hi, Rami, what's up? ﻿I'm okay. Where are you? -Downstairs, I'm waiting for you. ﻿Did you forget we were supposed to meet? ﻿Did you bring the results? -No, I'm here for the fun of it. ﻿I'm coming down. ﻿Dude, he only sprayed a bit, don't overdo it! ﻿Shut up, go take care of your own shit. ﻿Hi. ﻿Why so tense? -Show me the results. ﻿Okay, sit down a second. -I don't feel like it. ﻿Then I'm not showing you. ﻿Do you even know how to read the results? -Yes. ﻿How? -I just do. If you don't show me, I'm leaving. ﻿Alright, hold on. ﻿Just a peek. ﻿Hey, I didn't see a thing! ﻿You know what? I'm outta here. ﻿Don't call me, don't talk to me, I've had it with you. ﻿Okay, okay, wait, I'll show you. ﻿You're not pregnant at all! ﻿You're not pregnant at all! ﻿It's the bud Sagi sprayed. ﻿Finally, some normal grass. ﻿Where's David? ﻿May His great Name grow exalted and sanctified. -Amen. ﻿In the world that He created as He willed, ﻿may He give reign to His kingship in your lifetimes and in your days ﻿and in the lifetimes of the entire Family of Israel, ﻿swiftly and soon. Now say Amen. . --Amen... ﻿Does anyone want to say a few words?j x ﻿David was a skinny man who loved to smoke. ﻿He was a man of contradictions. ﻿And if you asked me what David's thinking now, ﻿looking at us from above, ﻿I would tell you exactly ’what he's thinking. ﻿Who will win the finals. ﻿David's last wish was that you win the finals. ﻿That you restore the honor to David's neighborhood, ﻿the neighborhood where David walked his final path. ﻿David died young, and only God knows why. ﻿I know why he died. ﻿I know why he died. ﻿I know why he died... ﻿David, what's wrong ﻿Why are you acting like that? ﻿Tell Sagi they burned the grass. ﻿"Tell Sagi they burned the grass!" ﻿Why David? ﻿Why David? ﻿Why? ﻿Why David? ﻿You should be ashamed of yourselves. I expected a lot of things, ﻿but I didn't expect you to kill David. ﻿I invested so much in him... cigarettes, social security... ﻿Including David, you owe me 30 thousand shekels. ﻿But it wasn't our fault. It was his lungs. -David is dead! ﻿Dead! ﻿Let's be honest, we killed David. ﻿It wasn't our fault. It was an accident. ﻿I killed David. -Shut up! ﻿Twenty thousand and not another word. ﻿I've been wondering what to do with you two since this morning. ﻿You leave me no choice. ﻿You gotta lose the finals. ﻿Throw the game. ﻿No problem. -No problem. ﻿You could've at least argued a bit, ﻿pretended you care, like you have a drop of dignity. ﻿Little Cohen is nothing like big Cohen. ﻿Get outta the car. ﻿Sagi, please don't cut off my finger. Please. ﻿I'd rather have a player who misses than a replacement who scores a goal. ﻿But don't suck too much, Cohen. ﻿One or two goals are enough. ﻿No need for ten. ﻿Hold this. ﻿Grab his hair. Grab his hair! ﻿Tight! Pick it up. ﻿Remember, ﻿I put a lot of money on the game. ﻿Imagine a blue sky and a trophy in the middle.. ﻿Touch the trophy. ﻿In your mind! ﻿I won't shame this neighborhood. ﻿I won't be an asshole. ﻿I will give my soul. ﻿I will fight like a lion. ﻿I respect Tzvika. ﻿Tzvika respects me. ﻿Tzvika respects me! ﻿Me! -Me! ﻿Welcome to the final game for the Jerusalem neighborhoods Cup! ﻿The Lions from Rehavia against the Soccer Field Stars from Ramot. ﻿I told you not to hang out with scum. ﻿Now Amir's in the hospital. -An overdose? ﻿He shot himself in the foot by accident. ﻿That means there's no bench today, no replacements. ﻿You all give everything you got, everyone's on and everyone's off. ﻿And David's over there, watching us from above. ﻿Welcome Tzvika and the Soccer Field Stars from Ramot! ﻿My friend. -Hey, what's up? ﻿It's so good to see you. I had stuff to do, I couldn't make it. ﻿That's okay, you come when you can, in your own time, Cohen. ﻿hope to make it next Friday. ﻿You do what you can. But come, it'll wake you up. ﻿God willing we will prevail! ﻿Amen. -Fear nothing. ﻿Avishai! ﻿Thank you. ﻿Come on, kids. ﻿Avishai, you sonofabitch, what's up with that goal?! I'll waste you, /fyou motherfucker! ﻿Kick the ball! ﻿You piece of shit! What are you doing? ﻿You motherfuckin' son of a whore. ﻿There goes the money. ﻿15 minute halftime. 2-0 for The Lions. ﻿All income from refreshments ﻿The Lebanon war. My friend's wounded, bleeding to death, ﻿we're surrounded by Sunni, Shi'ites, Hizbollah, one big mess. ﻿And a voice inside me says: Run, Tzvika, run! ﻿I couldn't. ﻿I couldn't! I threw him over my back and ran, ﻿I ran like an animal, bullets whistling around me, ﻿bombs exploding everywhere. ﻿I ran and ran, I ran with all my might. ﻿Today, the guy has a wife and three kids. ﻿And I have a wooden leg. ﻿I spent one year in the hospital, 2 years in rehab, ﻿I could've played in the national league. ﻿And you know what? I'm not sorry. ﻿But if we lose today, ﻿I'll be sorry. ﻿I'll be sorry I can't play. ﻿Don't cry Tzvika, don't cry! ﻿Shaul! ﻿Remember you asked me why I hate Kadosh? ﻿Kadosh used to sell games. ﻿Right, Sagi? ﻿I haven't had this feeling ﻿in 20 years. ﻿I feel like someone's trying to pull my chain. ﻿This isn't the team I trained. Something stinks. ﻿If I hearthat someone sold the game, ﻿Sagi will bury him in the woods. ﻿fight for every ball, ﻿keep your commitments, even if it kills you. ﻿Did you hear what he said? ﻿We gotta win this game. ﻿He was just saying that, you moron. ﻿He said to fight for every ball even if it kills us. ﻿No, you moron, he said keep your commitments, ﻿even if it kills you. Didn't you get that? ﻿We are at the second half. The visitors still have the upper hand. ﻿The score is 2-0. ﻿Ball out... Valderama didn't get to the ball. ﻿And a foul called against The Soccer Field Stars... ﻿Motherfucker! ﻿You worm, I hope you wear black your entire life! ﻿You scumbag! ﻿Tzvika, what do we do? ﻿Sagi! Sagi! ﻿Get in here! ﻿Get in here! ﻿I need you! ﻿Come here, give 'em a fight, come on. ﻿Get over here! ﻿Sagi, Sagi, Sagi... ﻿He can't play, he's not on the roster. ﻿a resident of the neighborhood. ﻿He's not listed as a replacement, ﻿You piece of shit! Why shouldn't he play? ﻿You injured one of my players. ﻿Out of my way. ﻿Give me the shirt. ﻿Folks, if he's a resident of Ramot, he can play. ﻿Ouch! ﻿Penalty! ﻿-Sagi kicks. We are the champions... ﻿Way to go! ﻿Thanks, Sagi, just like the good old days. ﻿I told you, ﻿you don't slaughter a sick sheep. ﻿But you gotta try. -Tzvika. ﻿Shame on you. ﻿I'm proud of you. ﻿You made me lose a lot of money today. ﻿Come by on Sunday, we'll work something out. ﻿I wanted to say you played really well. ﻿Thanks. ﻿I love the short hair. ﻿Thanks. ﻿And I missed you. Me too. ﻿Really? ﻿...It has been three weeks since the big game ﻿and the victory is still... ﻿"First Place" ﻿Tzvika, when do we start practicing again? ﻿He just got a trophy and already he wants another one. ﻿I don't know about that. I'm not sure. ﻿I might open a Shawarma stand. I'll know in October. ﻿What about my 250 Euros? ﻿We haven't forgotten, it's just.... ﻿You'll get it on Sunday. -God willing. ﻿Sunday, huh? ﻿Okay, that's 20 shekels per person. ﻿Here you go. ﻿Including the tip. ﻿Valderama. ﻿Are you crying ﻿No, no way. ﻿Just shedding a tear. ﻿Come on, I'll take you home. ﻿I'll be off too. ﻿What can I say? ﻿Your coach is a genius! A genius! ﻿Let's go, Valderama. ﻿So? ﻿Got anything to smoke? ﻿I got a little something. ﻿So let's smoke it.
