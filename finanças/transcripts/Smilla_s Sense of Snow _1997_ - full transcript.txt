Hey ya! Hey ya! Why, Smilla? My baby. Isaiah! He was playing on the roof. He fell. All right, nothing to see now. Come on. I just need a few from this angle. O.K. I f-f-found him. What made him run? Who are you? I'm the lady who lived upstairs from him. He's the gentlemen from the ground floor. Well, you're not allowed up here. I'll need the footprints of the deceased. I don't know why the hell he was playing up here, running around wild without supervision. A strange way to play, don't you think? Take these people downstairs. The tracks go in a straight line towards the edge. No child in the world would play like that. Can you just go down now, please? Why so many accidents, Smilla? First my husband, and now my baby. Why, Smilla? I don't know. How am I going to go to the morgue tomorrow? If they think it's an accident, why are they doing an autopsy? They told me to show up and... sign papers, and get his things. I'll go, Juliane. Let me go. I had hoped he would live a long life. Yes. All parents hope that for their children. I have children of my own. I know how you must feel. My deepest condolences. I'm not his mother. We were friends. Beat it, you little shit. Wanna read me a story? No, I won't read you a story. Persistent little bastard, aren't you? I can't be your little friend. O.K.? I have nothing to offer you. Just go away. Hmm? Look, there's absolutely no future in this. "A point is that which cannot be divided. A line is a length without breadth. " This can't possibly interest you. Hmm. "A semicircle is a figure contained within a diameter and the circumference intersected by the diameter. " You smell bad. I don't mean to say this to hurt your feelings, but you really stink. What interests you? Do you know anything about Greenland? Hmm. You should know something about where you're from. Why? Because it tells you who you are. It's important to know who we are. Do you know who you are? No. Did your mom read you stories? She told me stories. About what? About Greenland. When she used to hunt, stories like that. Miss Smilla, can we go home? Why, are you tired? No, home to Greenland. What do you want me to do, lie to you? Tell you we'll go to Greenland and then not go? Get your hopes up? If Inuits who are feuding wish to reconcile, they touch each other's breasts, and say ilaga. Ilaga. Ilaga. It means friend. Ilaga. When a child dies like that, it's a tragedy. Terrible accident. It wasn't an accident. I see. Who did the autopsy? It was routine. That's not what I asked you. Doctor Loyen. Johannes Loyen? Isn't he the head of the Institute of Arctic Medicine? Mm-hmm. Why would such a famous man do an autopsy on a 6-year-old? It was routine. So you've said. I'm so sorry for your loss. Do you think his feet were cold? He always wore those sneakers. When I saw him lying there in the snow, his soles were so run-down. His feet must have been cold. Would you like something to drink? I may be from Greenland, but I don't drink. Are you... Are you hungry? Look, I don't want to share anything with you. O.K.? O.K. Perhaps you can sleep. Go-G-Good night. Do you always stutter? No. I make you nervous then? Don't you think I see the way you look at me? What did you think, we'd get drunk and fuck all night, fueled by our mutual grief? Is that what you thought? It's O.K., Smilla. I loved him, too. Yeah. Of course you did. Dr. Loyen. You're of Greenlandic descent. My mother was Greenlandic. You were the one who examined Isaiah? Yes. What I would like to know is what did he die of? He fell from a height of 5 stories. The organism as a whole simply collapses. Was there any trace of violence? None at all. What makes you think that? Is it possible to see the report? You wouldn't understand it. Look, both we and the police are interested in the most thorough investigation possible. In a case like this, if there's even the slightest doubt, we look for everything and we find everything. A child defends itself, gets skin cells under its nails. There was nothing like that, nothing at all. We looked at the police report. The footprints show quite clearly that the boy was alone on the roof before he fell. There was nothing to indicate that this was anything but an accident. It's tragic, of course, but the case is closed. Now, please drop by again, my dear lady, if there's anything else that troubles you. I'm filing a complaint with the district attorney. What makes this your business? A 6-year-old boy was murdered. I'm making it my business. I've told you there's no forensic evidence to indicate foul play, none whatsoever. I don't really care about your forensic evidence. I knew him, and that's my evidence. We all have our phobias. Do you know what Isaiah's was? It was heights. Nevertheless, he was up there. Yes, he was. And what puzzles me... what keeps me awake at night is wondering what made him go up there at all. May I please spend the night? Hello! Hello! We're going to miss the film. You're late. I've called the agency twice. It's not the baby-sitter, dear. Come in. We get 1,000 cases a year. I can't be expected to remember every single one. Unburden yourself, Lagermann. You'll feel better. We were very busy the night he was brought in: drunk drivers, Christmas parties. You're not squeamish, are you? No. I have a little trick, the kind of thing you invent in any profession. I hold a light bulb inside his trousers. In one leg, there is a perforation. I examine the boy again. All of this is routine. I find a hole in his thigh. There's no bleeding, and the tissue hasn't contracted. You know what that means? No. It means that whatever happened at that spot occurred after his heart had stopped beating. I take a closer look at his trousers. There's a little indentation around the hole. This rings a bell. So I get out a biopsy needle, a kind of syringe, quite big, attached to a handle. You plunge it into the tissue to get a sample. The hole in his trousers was where someone in a hurry shoved it in with a good whack. Someone had taken a muscle biopsy from him after he died. The ambulance men? I talked to the driver and the medics and the orderlies who received the body. They all swore on a stack of Bibles that they didn't do it. Why didn't Loyen tell me this? I was just beginning the autopsy when Loyen arrived. He was surprised I'd started on the boy. He pulled me off it and took over. What do you think was after him on the roof? I don't know. But I won't be much in the Christmas spirit until I find out. Please don't come here again. One more thing. The night he died wasn't the first time I'd seen him. He came in once a month. Loyen examined him... alone. I don't suppose there are any records. I've already looked. Nothing. Man: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings, and heavenly places of the Christ... ...the foundation of the world... that we should be holy and without blame before Him. And love, having predestinated us... ...by Jesus Christ who Himself... ...in praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted... in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace... Who was that man at the funeral? What was he trying to give you? I don't want his money no more. Dirty money. What money? Why does he give you money? They always try to buy me out. First my husband, now my kid. Who's they? "We wish to inform you that the directors of Greenland Mining have decided to grant you a widow's pension following the death of your husband... Norsaq Christiansen. " It's signed Elsa Lubing. Who's she? Who's Elsa Lubing? Can I take this? Oh, yes. I filmed this as you came back from the hunting trip with your mother. You'd had bad weather with a lot of fog. You were lost. Everyone had given up hope. Your mother said you suddenly pointed with complete conviction. You knew the way home. No one could explain it. From that day on, they always strapped you to the front of the sledge whenever they went on a hunting trip. You knew exactly how to get home. Yeah, Father. How the hell do you explain that? I don't know. I just knew. You were a regular little Eagle Scout. A real little Nanook of the North. Cut it out, Benja. You should try Brentan. What? Brentan. For fungus between the toes. It's not fungus. People don't get that till they reach your age. Yeah, adolescents do, too. Especially if you work out a lot. And it spreads quite easily to the crotch. What do you know about Johannes Loyen? He's a... very talented man. He created the Institute for Arctic Medicine. What's his interest in forensic medicine? He started out as a pathologist. He did an autopsy on a 6-year-old boy. Ha. Must have been a good career move. Since our school days, Loyen has always wanted to be recognized as the best in the world, not just in Denmark, but in the universe. It wasn't a flame like in the rest of us. It was a conflagration. He wrote this as his thesis for his professorial degree. " Mesozoan Parasites. " What are they? Prehistoric worms. Write me a prescription, Father. Are you sick, Smilla? With this piece of paper, you can save my life and keep your hippocratic oath. It has to be 5 figures. I let someone down. A child. It'll take money to do something about it. I'm afraid that check won't be nearly enough. He only gives you money because you make him feel so guilty. He told me that. And he only gives you money, Benja, because you're such an amusing little fuck. But one day, like all of us, you'll wake up and your perfect tits will be starting to sag, and your perfect little piquant ass will be starting to go. Then what, Benja? By then, Smilla, you'll be dead, and I won't care. Come for Christmas dinner? I don't celebrate Christmas. It doesn't mean anything to me. They hunted seals by their igloos. They stalked them with screens on the ice. "They waited for them on a floe edge, and they harpooned them from kayaks. " They hunted them in the bluish darkness of the winter night. To the Inuits, the seal was life. Isaiah, what did I just say? Isaiah? Tell me what I just said. Tell me. What did I just say? My God. Juliane? Juliane, Isaiah's gone deaf. He's gone deaf from having 3 ear infections from you not taking care of him! Doctors say he was O.K. What doctors? Who told you he's O.K.? He's not O.K. There's nothing to worry about. Ilaga. I'm not mad at you. Ilaga. Stop it. I'm not mad at you. Ilaga, ilaga. Yes, you're my friend. Ilaga, Isaiah. Please... don't be frightened. I'm from the district attorney's office. Do you always make house calls? Let's just say it's the nature of this case... and because of your thought-provoking letter. I spoke to Professor Loyen. He told me that you came in to see him. There were tracks in the snow. I read the report and looked at the pictures. You have to have special lenses and lights or it doesn't show up. What doesn't show up? They were acceleration tracks. When you take off from the snow or ice, a pronation occurs in the ankle joint like when you walk barefoot in the sand. If the movement is too fast, not firm enough, they'll be a little slip backwards. As with any child who is playing... If you're used to playing in the snow, you don't leave that kind of track because the movement is not efficient. He grew up in Greenland. He was used to snow. You don't believe me? I didn't say that. The truth is I've felt uncomfortable about this case from the beginning. And when you wrote your letter, that confirmed it for me. There was so little to go on. What do you want me to do? Find out what was after him. I'll do my best. You have my word. Thank you. I don't know your name. Raven. I'll be in touch with you. Thank you, Mr. Raven. Thank you for believing me. Hello? My name is Smilla Jaspersen. I have some questions about Greenland Mining. I'm sorry, I can't help you. I don't work there anymore. Who is it? Delivery for Elsa Lubing, from the florist. She isn't home. Could you buzz me in, please? We have strict instructions not to open the door for nonresidents. They're orchids, Mrs. Schou, straight off the plane from Portugal, and they'll die if I leave them out here. I can see you! You won't get away with anything. I remember this letter quite well. She said she had flowers. It's all right, Mrs. Schou. At this time of day, I'm normally in prayer. Norsaq Christiansen's death was a tragic accident, especially for the boy. A child needs both parents... one of the reasons why marriage is sacred. Mr. Lubing would be pleased to hear that. There's no Mr. Lubing. I am the bride of Jesus. The boy is dead. 4 days ago, he fell off a roof. I met him once. When I saw him I knew why it was written: " Unless we become as little children, we cannot enter paradise. " I hope his mother finds her way to Jesus. Only if one can find Him at the bottom of a bottle. Oh, He is everywhere, even there. Someone chased the boy off the roof. He was murdered. The devil assumes many forms. It's one of those forms that I'm looking for. Do you know a Professor Loyen? No. Was he on the payroll of Greenland Mining? I don't remember. You said that you met Isaiah. When? Greenland Mining began to hire Inuits for the geological expeditions, and it was on one of those expeditions in the summer of 1993 on the Gela Alta glacier... that the father died. When we awarded the pension, the son and his mother came to my office. How did the father die? An explosion. You are interested in the past, Ms. Jaspersen. I'm interested in why the chief accountant of Greenland Mining has such a guilty conscience that she's writing notes in the margins of pension awards. May I see the report of that expedition? They're in the safe in the archive department. There's nothing to see. Thou shalt not lie, Ms. Lubing. I think you should go now. Why do you think someone was chasing the little boy? There was snow on the roof that he fell from. I saw his footprints. The way you have a sense of God, I have a sense of snow. Ms. Jaspersen? Hello? Would you come back up for a moment? Just now when you left, I opened... it at the Book of Revelations. "And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from Heaven onto the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. " The key to hell. Miss Jaspersen, how far will you go? Try me. There are 2 archive sections in the basement of our building on Strand Boulevard. That's where the expedition reports are kept. Naturally, I cannot mention that there's a passkey system nor that the abloy key on the wall behind you is for the main entrance to the building. Ms. Lubing: Someone has to guard the gates of hell. Good doggie. Ah! Why were you following me? I've been thinking about what you said... about the footprints. If you're right, you're in danger. You can, um... sit. Isaiah and I were friends, you know. He used to make me laugh. He had this little game where he used to put his head in his hands like this, and when he'd come up, he would be... a monkey or a rabbit or Frankenstein or whatever. I used to see him, um... come home sometimes in a cab. I... He always seemed so... so afraid. They examined him every month at the hospital. I think that's what scared him. Why? What do you think they were looking for? I don't know. Someone shoved a biopsy needle into him after he died, and a very important doctor... I do... appreciate it when someone makes me something good. Thank you. Don't go. Isaiah's father was on an expedition for Greenland Mining when he died. That prick Loyen was the medical consultant. I saw his name in here. Try to read it. It'll be good for your dyslexia. Smilla. Why does such a nice person have such a rough mouth? I'm sorry if I've given you the impression it's my mouth that's rough. I try to be rough all over. Miss Jaspersen, I'd like to talk to you, please. Talk. Would you mind coming to the station with us? I would mind. I'm sorry, you must. Keep your hands off me. I'll come with you, just take your hands off. Get your hands off me! You don't have to go if you don't... f- f-feel like it. Will I be driven home? To your door. Can't resist a man with manners. See you later. "Smilla Jaspersen, born the 16th of June, 1960, in Quanaaq, Greenland. Parents: Ann Qaavigaaq Jaspersen, a local hunter, and Moritz Jaspersen, American physician. In 1989, employed by the Geodetic Institute. From 89-93, scientific participant in expeditions to the ice cap, the Arctic Ocean, and arctic North America. " Various references are attached... all of which state unanimously that if you want to know anything about ice, you would benefit by consulting Smilla Jaspersen. Captain Telling here, however, has gathered some information of a different character. Moved to Denmark in 1967 after the death of your mother. Expelled from 4 boarding schools. Admitted to Copenhagen University, asked to leave a year later. " Then there are these other references, all of which state that you have created trouble wherever you've been. Arrested twice. Once in Canada. I was tagging polar bears. Bears don't read maps, so they don't respect national boundaries. This paints a picture of a woman who has never completed a course of study, who has been unemployed for years, who has no family, who's created conflict wherever she's been: someone who has never been able to fit in. Anyone with any sense would keep a very low profile in your position. Is it my clothes you don't like? What we don't like are your fruitless and damaging attempts to meddle in the investigation of this case which I have already promised you I would look into. I remember what you promised me. Screw you, Raven. These belong to Greenland Mining. We found them in your flat. Imprisonment in a little soundproof room with no windows is, I've been told, particularly difficult if you've been brought up in Greenland. This would cause you extreme distress. It's true, is it not? They say it's something about those vast spaces, the horizon. That what it is? All that space. Good. Then we mustn't let that happen. We've reached an agreement, then. Will you say that louder, please, so I can hear you? Yeah. We've reached an agreement. You may go home now. Smilla, this is your father. Could you come for lunch tomorrow at the club? Call me... Anything is better than suicide? How can you have 6 spelling mistakes in 5 words? I'm not suicidal. Suicide is for cowards. Sometimes one just wants to be left alone, that's all. There was an earlier expedition in '66. There was an accident that time, too. 2 of the 8 men died. Loyen was on both expeditions. I can't be part of this. I came to tell you that. I'm out of it. Good luck. Smilla. W... What did they d... do to you? They threatened to lock me up. And I can't be locked up. I'm quite ashamed. Really, I am. I just can't be locked up. Don't. It's O.K. Do you think I need you to understand me? God. Sorry. What is it about you that always makes me want to insult you? When my father first brought me here from Greenland, I refused to sleep indoors. I couldn't stand it: the heat. I was used to the snow, the air. I made a tent out on the lawn. Poor Moritz. He was so embarrassed. Even now my idea of hell is to be locked up. Where... Where was your mother? She went out one day to hunt. They found her kayak a few days later. The side had been staved in. No one who falls into the water in Greenland ever comes up again. The sea is less than 39 degrees Fahrenheit, and at that temperature, all the processes of decomposition stop. - How old were you? - 6. That's when you came here? That's when my father brought me here. But you were never happy here? The only thing that makes me truly happy is mathematics, snow, ice, numbers. To me, the number system is like human life. First you have the natural numbers, the ones that are whole and positive, like the numbers of a small child. But human consciousness expands, and the child discovers longing. Do you know the mathematical expression for longing? Negative numbers. The formalization of the feeling that you're missing something. Then the child discovers the in-between spaces between stones, between people, between numbers, and that produces fractions. But it's like a kind of madness, because it doesn't even stop there. It never stops. There are numbers that we can't even begin to comprehend. Mathematics is a vast, open landscape. You head towards the horizon that is always receding... like Greenland. And that's... that's what I can't live without. Smilla. That's why I can't be locked up. Can I kiss you? Smilla. It's Christmas Eve. Toast with me. To what? To Isaiah. Don't you understand? My heart is broken. Then to a merry Christmas. And a happy New Year. Smilla. Merry Christmas, Smilla. Juliane, you look wonderful. 2 days, Smilla. No drink. Merry Christmas, Smilla. He hid this box good. You should keep it now. Open it. His Walkman. You gave it to him last Christmas. Remember? It was his best present. They let Isaiah go with them on the expedition? The Greenland Mining people were looking for men in Greenland. My husband signed on. They told us that Isaiah could go with him, so how dangerous could it be? They were digging inside a glacier. Something must have happened. Isaiah was outside. They took his dad in a helicopter to the hospital, and there his dad died. He never saw him again. What really happened, Juliane? Be careful, Smilla. It was not an accident. There was something in the melt water. Isaiah told me so. In the melt water? How would Isaiah know? His daddy told him. But he couldn't have done. You just said they flew your husband away... Smilla, please. ...in a helicopter. Smilla, please. No more questions. Who brought Isaiah home? This doctor. Loyen. Was Isaiah sick, Juliane? Is that why Loyen examined him every month? Smilla, please. No more questions. I'm scared. But I'll do it anyway. I knew you would. The Inuit believe that if you kill something, you offend its soul. I need his soul to be at peace. Did you ever hear the phrase, "She was so drunk that she didn't know what she was doing"? That's why I'm doing this before I drink anything. Go back inside. Smilla. What? Don't answer the phone from now on. Smilla. What a surprise. We weren't expecting you. I thought you didn't celebrate Christmas. I don't. So what do you celebrate, Smilla? Oh, I celebrate the loners, the outcasts, the shy girl with pimples, the fattest boy in class, dyslexics, the stutterers, the premature ejaculators. You're such a freak. Some men died on an expedition to the west coast of Greenland. I need to know why. Will you look at them for me? I thought you wanted to have lunch with us. Do this for me, Moritz. I'm happy today for the first time in ages. The man with the white hair. Do you know him? Dr. Andreas Tork. Scientist. Leading specialist in arctic mineralogy. Powerful man. Very ambitious. Head of Greenland Mining. Why? You want to meet him? Why would someone examine a child every month at a hospital? If he'd been exposed to a virus, to, uh... Why would someone shove a biopsy needle into a dead 6-year-old? Oh, gross. I'm not eating now. Forget it. Answer me. I'm not eating a bloody thing, Moritz. I don't know, Smilla. To measure the progress of something... you know. Thank you. Call me when you've looked at that. I was following you. He recognized me from the funeral. He stopped me and asked me how Juliane was doing. You were with him. I was not with him! We started to talk. I thought I could learn more about Greenland Mining. I was following you there. Smilla. Smilla. Don't you trust me? No. Juliane: I told you, we have nothing! Nothing! You fucking bastard! Oh... Leave us alone! Isaiah. What happened? It's O.K. It's me, Smilla. Isaiah. Smilla? How did you find me? It wasn't hard. You're considered the best ear in Copenhagen. You called about a tape. It was left next to an electrical box. Maybe that's what affected the sound on it. I can't make it out. Sounds like some kind of an announcement. I can't hear anything. That's because you haven't trained your ear. Hear it now? It's not live. It's coming from a loudspeaker. An intercom. Maybe in a hospital somewhere. Can you hear the doctor's beeper? No. And there's someone whispering, too. What's he saying? He's in a lot of pain. There's an EEG in there as well, monitoring his heart. What's he saying? It's difficult to say. It's an East Greenlandic dialect. He's... He's talking to his son... Isaiah. He's trying to tell what happened in an ice cave. Did you hear that? That's a Sikorsky R17 overhead. Late '93, early '94. This must be the hospital in the American air base in Thule. I'm amazed you can conclude so much from so little. Blindness sharpens the sense of hearing. Is there any way you can clean up the tape? Come back in an hour. Woman: Are you finished with that? Man: Yeah, that's all right. Hello? Were you really just following me? Yes. I want to kiss you again. Would you like that? Yes. Smilla, where are you? Smilla? Mr. Licht? Open the door! Open it! Open it! Talk to me. You have to talk now, Smilla. Snow. Talk to me about snow. So many. There's too many kinds. Say them! Qanik. What's that? Hmm? Talk. It's falling snow. What other kinds? Aquilluqqag. It's wet, wet snow. It's not firm enough to build a snow house with. You must never use it for that. I won't. Promise me? I promise. More. Come on, more. Did you hear the tape? They killed Isaiah for it. Did you get it? No. He could have made it. Not like Smilla, the fake. The fake Greenlander with her fine clothes and manners. I let him die. No, you didn't. The tablets will start to work in a few minutes. Then it won't hurt so much. You must sleep now. When I was little, I knew where I was going. Yes. I'm very lost now. Stay with me. I'm right here. Lie down with me. Kinngusaqattaarpoq. What does it mean? Say it. I can't say it. To practice rolling over in a kayak. Makittaqanngitsoq. Pff. Jesus. Someone who has never mastered the art of rolling over in a kayak. Umiiarneq. A shipwrecked person. You're not shipwrecked. Pilluaqaanga. It's to be deeply happy. I'm sorry, I have to go. Smilla? You cannot stay in your apartment. They've already tried to kill you once, and if they know you're alive, they won't make the same mistake again. Now go to your father's house. You'll be safer with him. I've seen that car before. Don't turn around. They found something in 1966. Something went wrong, and they waited 30 years before they sent another expedition. But then something else went wrong. There was an accident. 4 men died. One of them was Isaiah's father. So before Isaiah's father dies, he sends his son a tape telling him what really happened. Tork comes looking for the tape, they kill Isaiah to get it. And then they killed the man on the boat. There's got to be something else on that tape. Like what they really found up there in Greenland. They're planning to go up again. They've had to wait until now for the pack ice to melt in the Davis Strait. I know a man... who knows about boats. Norsaq Christiansen, dead, on the Gela Alta glacier, July 1993. Hmm. It says in the report that he died in an explosion, but I don't think that's what killed these men. These are enlargements I made from the negatives. You can see what remains of the liver, the esophagus, stomach. This is the heart... what's left of it. Smilla? Do you notice anything unusual here? Something's got into the heart. But what is it? This... This is so gross. What's it got to do with us? Get her out of here. Darling, why don't you wait for me outside? I'll join you later. But it's disgusting. What's it got to do with us? I'll be with you soon. Please. Please. Smilla? This is the arctic worm. Drancunculus Borealis. Prehistoric. No one has seen pictures of them before. Loyen must have photographed them. You see, the female worm entered these men's vital organs. The uterus burst. There were 10 million larvae released. The men go into toxic shock. They die on the spot. But it's very strange. Parasites don't usually kill their hosts. It's very bad manners. But I thought the worm was extinct. I thought so too, Smilla. But the question is, what brought them back to life? Why are you getting involved in this? I told you before... a child died. It's my New Year's resolution to make someone pay. This friend of yours who dropped you off. Is he also involved? I don't know. I don't know him very well. He has a repair shop which he never goes to. His hands are much too clean. He lies to me. I don't know what he does. Are you in love with him? I've been trying to avoid it all my life, so now that it's here, I just want to renounce it. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm tired of wondering why it is that every day I'm on this earth I'm in exile. I'm sorry you're so angry. I'm sorry I made you do things. Is it time for confession, Moritz? What things did you make me do? I made you leave your country. What were you supposed to do, leave me there? I punished you because your mother was dead. I'd look at you, and I'd see her face. I never loved anyone the way I loved your mother. Benja will be sorry to hear that. It's late, Smilla. I'm going to bed. All day today I thought about your hands on me. Your mouth on my mouth. This friend of yours, Lander. What does he do? He owns the place. Now, what can I do for you? I need to know where the boat is going... why it's going, and who's behind it. The ship you saw, the Kronos, it's classified ice class. They spent an incredible amount of money getting her ready. Whatever they're after has to be very lucrative for them to recoup the investment they've made. But you don't know... Normally a ship is chartered with a crew. But in this situation, you would prefer a bare-boat charter... a ship and nothing else. Then you find a captain. He has to be a special kind of person, the kind you can take aside, and over a full glass tell him that his wages will be a little out of the ordinary. On the other hand, you need all his tact and sensitivity. Where would someone find such a person? Right here. That gentleman over there. Captain Sigmund Lukas. A very, very skilled German seaman. Knows the North Atlantic like no one else. Doesn't drink, but he gambles. He no longer has a home or a family. And now he's for sale, if the amount is big enough. If he's so broke, whose money is he playing with? Uncle Lander's money, honey. That's why he's going to be nice to you. This is not a game. If you go on board that boat, they'll kill you. I need to know what happened to him. You don't even know where the boat is going. Wherever the boat is going, I'll find out why they killed Isaiah. They've come for you. Just keep walking. Don't turn around. Lander'll be waiting outside. Go to your father's house. Wait there. I'll meet you there. Man: Perfect! Miss Jaspersen? Miss Jaspersen. Go. - Open this door! - Go! I need you to help me get on the Kronos. What makes you think I can help? Just talk to Lukas. My life is shit. But whatever it's worth I owe to your boyfriend, so the answer is no. I'm going whether you help me or not. Wait, wait, wait. You scare me, honey. Other women, it's all threat, and no action. You, I believe. You'll go anyway and get yourself really fucked. So give me a call when you're ready. Thank you, Lander. O.K., thank you very much. It's the door straight on. Benja? You don't belong here. They're going to take you away. You can't run away your whole life. We'll get you a good lawyer. They'll find a way to kill me, or I'll just have an accident. I was resisting arrest. I tried to escape. And you'll spend your wretched life knowing you could have saved me. Are you going, or should I get... Give us a minute. But you promised me! Quiet! She is crazy! I can't take this anymore! Will you be quiet? What do you want me to do? Drive your car to the back so I can get in, and lie down on the floor, and then cover me. Lander. Where are you? Meet me at the marina. Thank you, Lander. I'm coming. Once you drive off, I'll send them after you. Benja. Leave me alone. Emergency at the hospital. Good night. Thanks for your help. I wanted peace and quiet so badly, wanted my family around me, but I never achieved that. I don't want to let you go, Smilla. I'll take that. Thank you, Lander. Change your mind and come back with me. I can't do that. Man: Ooh, sweet thing. Men: Welcome back, welcome back. We've been waiting for you. Nils Jakkelsen. Stick with me. I can do things for you. You know what I mean? You can start by getting my bag. Man: That's one way to do it. I'll take you to the captain. To your left, upstairs. Here. Straight on. It's in there. You can go, Jakkelsen. You're on board because we needed a cabin steward. Your duties include light cleaning, and you're responsible for the ship's laundry. You can go now. We have representatives from the shipping company with us, living on the upper boat deck. There's no admittance whatsoever. If you disobey this order, I'll have you locked up. How about a quick fuck? Women are crazy about me. Hmm. Smilla Qaavigaq Jaspersen. That must be a Greenlandic middle name. What's on the upper deck? Fucked if I know, man. I've never seen security like this before. This whole outfit is weird. Even the captain says he doesn't know where we're headed. And the crew. They're a pile of shit, and they stick together. They are scared, and they won't tell me why. And then the passengers on the upper deck we never get to see. Who the fuck are they? Then there's you, Smilla. Why'd Lukas let you on board? Everyone thinks you're a cop. You're spying on me? Actually, Jakkelsen, I came for a quick fuck. But you spoiled it by talking. And you're gonna help me, you little needle freak. No way. I get claustrophobic. I'm not kidding. You're not going. I am. I get claustrophobic. Press the button for the upper deck. If anyone tries to send you away, just refuse to leave. Give me an hour. If I'm not back in a hour, wake up Lukas. No. I can't do that, man. Why not? He's my father. That's why I'm on board. That's why I have the key. He thinks I'm clean. You'd do that to me, man? You'd tell him? In a second. Now send me up. Gentlemen. What we are planning to bring back from our expedition to Greenland is a scientific sensation... the most valuable discovery ever made. An energy-producing meteorite, the fragment of a planet from the beginning of creation, back from the origin of the solar system. Not only will it multiply our investment, but it will give our company a very dominating position in the world. But there's a drawback. The stone brought a lethal prehistoric organism back to life. It's a kind of worm. Some of our men were killed by this worm when they were diving in the melt water around the meteorite on our last expedition. The only survivor is a child, who, unfortunately, ran into the water in an attempt to reach his father, one of the divers. Ever since this incident, this child has been kept under observa... Man:: Give me your hand here. This worm is always fatal, but only when it reaches the inner organs. It seems that young people can live with it longer, presumably because their immune systems are stronger. They're out of champagne. What did you see up there? Enough to nail those bastards. I've got her! No! What else could I do? I lit a cigar and put it up to the sensor. I'm really fucked now, man. They know it's me. Bunch of freaks! What the hell did you do to make them want to kill you? They want to kill both of us. This is the captain. We're approaching the Nordic Star platform. We'll be docked for about half an hour. All crew members are confined to quarters. No one is to leave the ship. I repeat - No one is to leave the ship. I've got to get off now. Don't look so panicky. Just stay close to Jakkelsen the Great. Ever been to Hong Kong? They offered me a modeling contract once. Let's go there. You are expressly refused permission to leave the ship. Any crew member attempting to do so will be arrested and taken into custody. Won't he worry about you? I'll send him a telegram. Let's get out of here. How about a quick fuck before we go? Once the lights go out, give me a head start, and then follow me. Relax, man. You can make it up to me in Hong Kong. Man: Aah! Get up! We're almost there. I don't feel well. It'll be hard to find a modeling job. Never look right at the audience. You got to look over their heads. Proud. Like you don't give a shit. Like a fucking star, man. Like a star. Yeah, Jakkelsen. Like a star. Oil rigging will commence in 45 minutes. Please be sure to secure all your safety clothing as recommended by the Ansi safety standards. Oil rigging will commence in 45 minutes. Please be sure to secure all your safety clothing as recommended by the Ansi safety standards. What are they paying you? Is it enough? The g-government never pays well enough. Listen to me! Listen to me! The government knew that there was something big going on. They didn't know what it was exactly, but they knew they were going again. They hired me because I was a diver, because I was the kind of person that Tork needed. I met him; he trusted me. He arranged for me to move into the building to keep an eye on the boy. I didn't even know that he was sick. You never loved him! Of course I loved him! I just wanted to protect him, and for a while, I thought that I could. Listen to me. Listen. There's not a night that goes by... that I don't dream that I catch him. I catch him in my arms... ...before he hits the ground. We can start over. Tork and Loyen are desperate. They're under extreme pressure. They'll show no mercy. You can hide in my cabin, but only for a little while. The ship is approaching the coast. You've to get ashore. Just go inland. Wait for me. There's a village just inside the bay about 7 miles to the south. You see how it's drawing energy from some sort of vacuum in the center? I knew you'd come. For people with resources, the right events happen. They may look like coincidences, but they arise out of necessity. Incredible, isn't it? We can see inside it. It's not a real meteorite. Meteorites are cold. This is warm. Meteorites are dead. This... is alive. And why are you doing all this, Tork? Why, money. Fame. More money. This is the biggest scientific discovery of the century. You can't remove it and transport it to a densely populated part of the world. Not until you know exactly what it is. You could set off a catastrophe. Oh, death is always a waste, but sometimes it is the only way to arouse people. Bohr participated in the construction of the atom bomb and thought it would promote peace. You lack imagination, Smilla, which is unforgivable in a scientist. What about the boy? He jumped into the damn water. We were forced to take him along into the cave. His father collapsed while he was still near the surface. The boy wanted to go to him. It was Loyen's idea to keep him under observation. The worm was not in his internal organs. He never even felt it. Aaarrrgh! He killed my son. Tork! Tork! The boy, Tork. Tell me about the day he died. You were waiting outside his school, weren't you, Tork? He's the only child who walks home alone. Smilla: You follow him. You grab him, not by his arms, but by his clothes so you don't leave any marks. But you miscalculate. He knows you, Tork, Not from the hospital where you spent hours tormenting him, but from the day he saw his father die. It's death itself he associates with you. You're guessing. He gets to his building and then there's no escape. He knows what's behind him. He knows he's going to die. This fear is even stronger than his fear of heights. Inside him an engine is spinning that will keep turning until all his strength is used up. And you chase him up to the roof. Maybe for the first time it occurs to you not just to get the tape... but that it's possible to eliminate him. And avoid him ever telling anyone what he saw in a cave on a glacier somewhere in the Davis Strait. I didn't mean to kill him. I needed the tape. He panicked, I shouted, he turned around, he didn't see me. You're lying. He didn't turn around. He couldn't hear a thing. He was deaf.
