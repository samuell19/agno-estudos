[MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening, Senor Presidente. Good evening, Miss Webber. Kate. Carlos. Carlos. Let me carry your bag. It's not heavy. It's not heavy. Kate-- gracias. How was Paris? Beautiful. What time is your train in the morning? 07:00. So early? It's the only way I'll get to the interview. Give 'em hell. RUBEN: [INAUDIBLE] muchachos, here comes Quintas. MIGUEL: (ON RADIO) With the babe? RUBEN: Both of them. MIGUEL: (ON RADIO) The lucky guy. (LAUGHS) Miguel here lurking 'round the corner. RUBEN: He's checking behind, that he's not being followed. Should be looking ahead. MIGUEL: (ON RADIO) That's where Alfonso is. RUBEN: Home, sweet home. What is it, a squat? Yes. They say it's a safe house. Well, I suppose they know what they're doing. Oh yes, quite safe. Good. KATE WEBBER: (ON RADIO) How do you like it? CARLOS QUINTAS: (ON RADIO) Neat. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] KATE WEBBER: (ON RADIO) Let me give you the goodies. CARLOS QUINTAS: Gracias. I should give you a receipt for the $2,000. KATE WEBBER: (ON RADIO) What on earth for? CARLOS QUINTAS: (ON RADIO) A government in exile has to be regular, Kate. Everything accounted for. KATE WEBBER: Received with thanks, from Miss Kate Webber, on behalf of the Paris committee, $2,000, Carlos Quintas, president. (GIGGLES) Well, perhaps it's a bit silly, but I don't know how these things are done. No, you're quite right. I'll keep it as a memento. This as well. CARLOS QUINTAS: (ON RADIO) A present? KATE WEBBER: (ON RADIO) The steward on the plane gave it to me, saying it was for you. CARLOS QUINTAS: (ON RADIO) Oh. For you. Cuidate. Take care. Very good. KATE WEBBER: (ON RADIO) Did you know about it? CARLOS QUINTAS: (ON RADIO) No, it's Ramon. He loves to show me how smart he is at fixing things. Can you use it? Yes. It'll make a very nice paperweight. [BREAKING GLASS] KATE WEBBER: (SCREAMS) Oh my god. Carlos! Kate, get your things. Get down. Kate! Your things! Upstairs. Keep going to the right. Straight out, hug the wall. Let me help you. All right, straight out. Turn right. Watch it. Do you want a lift? Do you want a lift? Yes, please? Come on. Get out of the car. What? Get out of the car. Shit. My god, Carlos, what was that for? This van was parked outside the house when we arrived. This van? Same make. And then it's conveniently around, and offering us a lift. Too convenient. So then why didn't we refuse? Look, Kate, we're in danger and I'm terrified. Now we have to get away. That's all that matters. The same van, Senor Presidente? CARLOS QUINTAS: (VOICEOVER) You see how crazy it's getting? You see how in trying to kill me they're forcing us together? Doesn't she know how I feel about her? Maybe not. Maybe she can't see it. Maybe-- Look, I think I know how you feel about me. If that's going to be a problem-- Oh, no, no, no, no. It's not a problem. You're right. When there's so much to do with so few resources, we must put aside our personal feelings in a single-minded fight for our country's freedom. Yes. Yet at the same time, we must never forget how crucial love is in our lives. For without love, Kate, what are we fighting for? Better make a phone call. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Good morning, ma'am. Who is the owner of this vehicle? I'm sorry? Whose van is this? The owner? Yeah. Officer, I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you. I don't know. Mm-hmm. Then who is the driver? I knew you'd understand. I don't know that, either. You don't know that either. Madam, why are you sitting in it then? I'm going home. Without a driver? No, he's just going to drop something off. Yes, could you please check that the phone's not out of order? It's very important. OK, pass me your bag? Why? Your bag. You'll have to come to the station house. Are you sure? Absolutely. POLICE DISPATCHER: (ON RADIO) Delta 74, to Travis Road. House on fire, arson suspected. Status of residence unknown. You're lucky. Tell the driver not to park on a zigzag line, even at night. All right, thank you very much for your help. I can't understand it, Kate. There's no reply from Raoul. This time of the morning-- I don't know. What do you think? Maybe it's out of order. Well, I'll drop you off, and go run and see. Carlos, get rid of the van and go to the police. You must protect yourself from the death squad. I can't possibly involve the police, Kate. Could be deported. You'd be safer abroad. Ah, safety. I have a mission to accomplish. Raoul. Raoul. Can-- can I help you? Just looking for Raoul. You-- you have not heard? CARLOS QUINTAS: No. I tried phoning. A friend? We are close. Oh. Oh, I am so sorry. Such a tragedy. He was killed in an accident. No, no, he can't. I saw him a few days ago. Raoul! NEIGHBOR: It was so silly. Outside the flat too, crossing the road. Whose fault? Who knows? The driver didn't stop. Night-- nobody sees it. He was such a nice man. I would to go to the funeral, but I have to go to hospital. When is it? This morning. St. Mark's cemetery. Thank you. [SPEAKING SPANISH] CARLOS QUINTAS: (VOICEOVER) "Oh yes, I knew him. I spent years with him, with his golden and stony substance. He was a man who was tired. In Paraguay, he left his father and mother, his sons, his nephews, his latest in-laws, his house, his chickens, and some half-open books. They called him to the door. When he opened it, the police took him, and they beat him up so much that he spat blood in France, in Denmark, in Spain, in Italy, moving about. And so he died, and I stopped seeing his face, stopped hearing his profound silence. Then once in a night of storms, I looked, and there was my friend. His face was formed in stone. His profile defied the wild weather. In his nose, the wind was muffling the moaning of the persecuted. There, the exile came to ground. Changed into stone, he lives in his own country." So much depending on so few. Brought together in death. Memories of the past, yet planning the future. Somehow, my life's in the hands of these people. Ramon, tremendous charisma and style, a natural man of action, the man who persuaded the different parties and groups to act together. Paco's a cosmologist. You know, the Big Bang, the beginnings of the universe, and life as we know it? Inez is my friend. Back home, she's a professor of anthropology. She was here in London when the generals carried out their coup. She now works in this office, and it's through her that we know Kate. [CHATTER] [NON-ENGLISH] Ramon? Hm? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Si. Que paso? Lo siento, hermano. There's my resignation. Inez, por favor. Paco, por favor. Carlos, his resignation. But that's impossible. You can't do it. It is essential you follow up this Pickwick. CARLOS QUINTAS: How do we know it can be trusted? Could be a trap. We don't. But you are the only one he'll meet with. The only one he trusts. And that's how they'll me. They'll make it look like an accident. Carlos, we will take precautions. If these Pickwick papers are authentic, it's dynamite. You really think it's that important. It's our biggest break yet. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] All right, I'll do what I can. RAMON: Gracias, Carlo. Vamos. Hello, Carlos. Hello, Christopher. Sorry I'm late. Ah, you're a very busy man these days. Why yes, all these matters of state. This is very nice, thank you. President Quintas, what protection are you receiving from the death squad? Death squad? Sent to assassinate you. Is my poetry that bad? No, no. Your politics. A mistake. I'm a poet, a figurehead, not a politician. The junta doesn't make that distinction. Then I advise them to read my poetry with more care. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] Good evening. As you may know, Carlos Quintas was invited to read here this evening prior to his becoming president. We're delighted that he has found the time to be with us tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, Carlos Quintas, poet and president. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. Mucho gracias. My English is not perfect. I wonder if someone has a copy of my selected poems that I could borrow. [LAUGHTER] Gracias. "Lone gentlemen, young homosexuals, and girls in love, and widows gone to seed. Sleepless, delirious, a novice housewife's pregnant, some 30 hours. The hoarse cats cruising across my garden shadows, like a necklace of throbbing sexual oysters, surround my solitary home like enemies, entrenched against my soul. Like conspirators in pajamas, exchanging long thick kisses on the sly. If only you would touch my heart. If only you would put your lips to my heart, your delicate mouth, your teeth. If you would place your tongue like a red arrow where my crumbling heart is beating. If you will blow over my heart near the sea crying it would ring with an obscure sound. Sound of train wheels, of dreams, like the to and fro of waters, like autumn and leaf, like blood. With the noise of damp flames burning the sky, dreaming like dreams." Hello, Kate. No, you don't know me, I'm Screech. I heard had quite a night with your friend the president. No, no, no, no, we had nothing to do with it. But your friend has got to be a bit more careful. Excuse me. No, no, don't be nervous. We're only trying to help. We? Who are we? Who are we, the usual meaningless collection of names and numerals. You know what security's like. Yes, they're a menace. Well, somebody's got to do it. And that's where we come in. And that's why. You and the president have got to be more careful. Keep out of politics. Change his plans. Oh, yes, he can talk about liberty, equality, fraternity, and the rights of man. Well, that's what they expect of a president. He can even try to depose the military dictatorship. They expect that too. But please, please, no more than that. It could be bloody dangerous. I'm not sure we could do anything about it, so see what you do. Use your influence. Personally, I'm on your side. I've always had a soft spot for the underdog. If you have something to tell me, tell me straight. I don't understand you. I emphasize, Kate, that I am on your side, and I'll do what I can. But you must do your bit as well. Stop the president trying to be a hero. CARLOS QUINTAS: "If you would blow on my heart near the sea like a white ghost would blow, on the lace of the spume, in the cut of the wind, like a unchained ghost crying at the sea's edge." Make him concentrate on his poetry. Oh yes, I've read it. It's wonderful. It's a pity it loses in the translation. [APPLAUSE] Take pity on the poet. I was always quick to forget. And then these hands of mine grasp only the intangible and unrelated things, which could only be compared by being non-existent. Carlos, Zoe, Zoe, Carlos. How are you? Sorry I'm late. Hi. How was the reading? Oh, they were very appreciative. You the journalist? Yes. Zoe was asking how things are going. Things are happening. I'm hoping to announce a major development next week. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Si, esta bien. Graci. Oh good, I'm starving. CARLOS QUINTAS: Whose is this? Friend of the family. They're away at the moment. CARLOS QUINTAS: Very nice. I got a shirt for you. Thank you. At some point, I must get my suitcase. Yeah. How did your interview go? Oh, they'll let me know next month sometime. You all right for money? Yeah, I can manage. What was the major development you mentioned to Zoe? I'll think of something. You mean there isn't one? No. So why on earth did you say there was? Propaganda. It's the kind of thing a journalist expects to hear from a government in exile. That's ridiculous. (VOICEOVER) Carlos, listen to yourself. Why are you beginning to argue with her, when all you have to do is take her in your arms and tell her that you love her? Yes, your problem with women, Carlos, they want you to be a better poet and a nicer guy then you can ever be. Maybe you should put her right. Yeah, it's the second road on the right. Mm-hmm 27. Who is it? Yeah, no 27 on the bell. Yeah, five minutes will be great. Who is it? Thank you. Who is it? It's my taxi. It'll be here in five minutes. You're going? Yeah. I have to see a friend. - A guy? - Yes. What about tomorrow? Well, first we have the Latin American exhibition, and then you meet Pickwick. Do you have to go? Yeah, I'm sorry. No, it's all right. Just at times, I get so lonely. KATE WEBBER: What are you saying? There's a compulsion to talk. No you're not. You want me to stay. Wouldn't be right, Carlos. We work together. Mine is a principled commitment, not personal. Now wait a second, that's not what I meant. I just don't want any misunderstandings or harassment-- Harassment? That's crazy. Good. Then there's no confusion? No. My taxi'll be here. I better go. Right. Night, Carlos. See you in the morning. Good night. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] Excuse me. Sorry, we're running late. We need to go. All right. Well, Miss Van Doorn, if you excuse me. If you call Inez at the office, I'm sure she'll work something out. Right. Looking forward to it. And who is Miss Van Doorn? She's a film director. And she wants us to join her in making a documentary. Excuse me, Dr. Quintas. Excuse me, President Quintas, could you spare us a moment, please? I'm afraid we're running late. Good. Let us talk while you walk. I am Vladimir, and my colleague Nikolai. You can tell we are Russian. Good. London representatives of the All-Russian pineapple export agency. Pineapples don't grow in Russia, they're South American. It explains our lack of success. Of course not. Joke. The Russian have a good sense of humor. We are with a trade mission. - Very boring. Import/exports. It's a Russian version of your independently wealthy. We wish to make a substantial donation to the government in exile. Very substantial. What do you think? Well, if you would put the details in writing, I'm sure the government in exile will be pleased to consider it. I knew it. They already accept the funding. Well, as with the pineapples, you have been misinformed. We're always being misinformed. It seems an occupational hazard. Our offer is genuine. Substantial funding to pursue your activities on a proper basis. I'm sure any offer in writing will be considered by the government in exile. Doctor Quintas, you're with friends. We know there is no government in exile. There is only you. You're being very presumptuous. President Quintas and the government have received worldwide recognition. Miss Webber, I think you are misinformed. There is no government in exile. Brilliant. So brilliant! Ramon and his friends chose Dr. Quintas, a non-political, internationally famous poet as president. Announced to the world that he is heading the whole party government in exile. The press print this as a fact, then abracadabra, it becomes reality. Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure. But like I said, if you put your offer in writing, be pleased to consider it. Thank you. Excuse us. I should have been told. You should have taken me into your confidence, Carlos. These are political realities, Kate. We're small at the moment, but effective. That's why they're trying to kill me. I thought you were committed, not a press-ganged president. Well, we all resist the best way we can. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, have you a light? Thank you. Quite a view, isn't it? Yes, but I'm here for the exercise. Physician's advice, with lots of fresh air. I suppose the poet's is a sedentary life. A president is worse. You wanted to meet, Ms. Pickwick, or whatever your name is? Not very original, is it? I have some papers that could be very helpful. Foreign Office papers? Yes, they're restricted. Not for public consumption. How did you get them? I'm a clerk. How do I know these are genuine? You don't trust me? Why should I trust you? I'm only here because I believe in what you're doing. I could be jailed for this. Ah, treason. The prison in the Tower, off with her head. Like your people did to Sir Walter Raleigh. He was a very good poet, you know. He had his fingers in a lot of pies. You should take more care of your poets. It was 300 years ago. The poetry lasts. "But could youth last, and love still breed, had joys no date, nor age no need, then these delights, my mind might move to live with thee, and be thy love." You are not taking me seriously. It's Ramon you should be talking to. You're president. You decide. Is it dangerous? When it gets out, very dangerous. MORRISEY: Hmm. [PHONE RINGS] I don't think so, I don't-- I mean, it's-- Hello, Dr. Quintas. Quintas. Hello, Mr. Morrisey. We're just having a drink. Won't you have one? Not for me, thanks. What did you have in mind? Straight to business, I like that. I'm a publisher, and I have a proposal I'd like to make on behalf of my company. Do I know it? It's a new publishing house. We want to start with a bang, with you. I'd like to offer you a contract for a book. Books are very time-consuming. Well, the advance we'd pay you, Dr. Quintas, would be $300,000. For a book of poems? Whatever kind of book you wanted. Verse, prose, essays, love stories. Politics? If you want it. You have complete freedom, $300,000. And maybe $500,000 in time. Paid to you anywhere in the world, on your instructions. Conditions? None. Only think of the writing. You're the artist. You're the one that people want to hear from. Well, I have other responsibilities and commitments. Well, if you decided, you'd have to resign and give them up. Just think of it. No pressure, no responsibilities, freedom to write without financial worries. $300,000, hmm? They are fantastic. This is the break I've been waiting for. How are we going to handle it? Well, we'll set up an exclusive interview, then television. And then we'll-- [EXPLOSION] What the hell? Wait. CARLOS QUINTAS: Que? It's my car. The bastards have blown it up. [INAUDIBLE]. No, you wait here till I find out what's happening. It could be a decoy. Hello, Kate. We haven't met. Screech is the name. He says he's British intelligence. I never made any such claim. Why didn't you tell me about him? - I think he's crazy. - It's true. It's true. Everybody in the department says so. But about the car bomb-- I'm sorry it was such a balls-up. Ramon will need a new car. You did it? What do you think we are, barbarians? We're a civilized country here. Of course, we do have our problems. But the department doesn't plant bombs, nothing like that. So then what was the balls-up? We tried to defuse it. As I told you, we don't like people who come and try to eliminate other people. Not on our territory. Our chap, he has this new device, this electronic gadget. He tried to immobilize the bomb by remote control, Didn't come off. Thhhbbt, car terminated. Was anyone hurt? My dear Miss Webber, there is a difference between fallibility and carelessness. Is anyone eating this cake? No. OK. Mm, very tasty. Do you know who planted it? I wondered if you'd ask that. It's delicious. Must have been death squad. Thought we had a sighting. Lost 'em. Pity about that. Picked up the bomb, though. Thank you. Can we go now? Yes, of course, of course. Try to keep a look out, if you can. Keep moving, that's my advice. Please. No, we can't reveal our source. They're absolutely genuine. All right, you can call them the Pickwick Papers. Well, that's wonderful. Thank you again. Yes, good night. You look pleased. They'll be published tomorrow. Kate will be delighted. Carlos, you want to be careful. What do you mean? I know you, Carlos. I read the signals. You can't keep your eyes off her. She's so beautiful. Do you blame me? No. Not as long as it doesn't interfere with work. On the contrary, she inspires me. She's my muse. Oh yeah. This loopy talk worries me, Carlos. You've got to keep your mind on the case. Behave like a president, not lost in rhyming luna con espuma. [NON-ENGLISH] but maybe there'll be space for both. I don't want you hurt. Keep on the case. That's the priority. It will be published tomorrow. What do you think? It's good. INEZ: I'm turning in. You know where everything is. Yes, and thanks again for supper. It was beautiful. Like a drink? No thanks. I'm seeing Morrisey tomorrow. Have you thought about his offer? CARLOS QUINTAS: I'll discuss it with Ramon. He wants you to continue. Ramon's a realist. I'll offer to share half the money with him, and we can fade away, and live quietly. What about the resistance? Doesn't that count for anything? What about all the people who've been looking to you for leadership? You will not all feel let down by my usurping of the presidency. You have to be realistic. What about the death squad? It's a chance we take. You've got to continue. Too many people need you. Too much at stake. Ah, see, Kate, how you've changed? It's not simple, is it? The first lesson we learn in active politics-- how far to go. Noble ends, dubious means. It's tricky, isn't it? So you're going to accept Morrisey's offer? I might. It's very tempting. But at the moment, I'm not sure, Kate. Night, Carlos. REPORTER: Six months ago a military coup, headed by General Martinez, overthrew a democratic government with a program to clean the country of sin and corruption. But the junta's policy of repression and torture remain deeply unpopular, as these demonstrations show. This morning, The Independent, in an exclusive front-page article, revealed documented evidence of collusion between the junta and the British government in concealing details of the imprisonment and disappearance of two British nuns working in the country, Sister Govern and Sister Lawrence. Well, here to discuss the background, and implications of the revelation is Dr. Carlos Quintas, president in exile. Dr. Quintas, how much of these revelations is based on fact, and how much is just pure conjecture? I'm sorry to say that all of these reports are entirely accurate. They are based upon government communications between the British embassy and the Foreign Office. So what do you hope to achieve by revealing this information? The parties of the Popular Unity are calling for an international embargo on any loans to the junta until it ends repression, respects human rights, and introduces a program for the return to democracy and free elections. REPORTER: Dr. Quintas, thank you very much indeed. CARLOS QUINTAS: Thank you. Good morning, Miss Webber. Morning. M Dr. Quintas apologizes, but he's busy. Yes, so I've been reading. It's a hectic time. He asked me to see you on his behalf. I understand. Has he made a decision on my offer? Not yet. He asked me to tell you he's still interested, but needs more time. I see. It's very pressing. You know, he's getting very involved. I need an answer. I need to know if he's continuing as an artist, or if he's becoming a politician. Will you tell him that, hm? Make sure he understands. Tell him I can now increase my offer to $500,000 in advance. That's a lot of money for a book. Well, other publishers around the world are interested. It all adds up. We'll keep in touch. I have another appointment. Of course. Remember, $500,000. Bye-bye. [PHONE RINGING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] You weren't good. I think I got the points over. I have a lot of things for you. RECEPTIONIST: Carlos, it's Ramon, for you. Gracias. [NON-ENGLISH] RAMON: (ON PHONE) A bad morning, Mr. President. We have an emergency. Come immediately to the coffee shop at the Russell Square Hotel, [INAUDIBLE]? What's going on? I'll tell you later. You leave at once. Bye. I've got to go. I'll call you later. We have plenty to do. Good, we'll attend to everything. Hold the fort. And repel the gringos. [NON-ENGLISH] RECEPTIONIST: Yes. Good morning, sir. Are you ready to order? Almost. Excuse me, sir? Aren't you Carlos Quintas? No. I'm sorry, yes. [SPEAKING SPANISH] We are very proud of you. Thank you. You're in London now? Yes. I was studying English when the coup happened. My father-- I think you know him a little-- Professor Raja Cortez. [SPEAKING SPANISH] He was dismissed from the university. He hasn't been arrested yet, but we don't know how long he'll be free. My brother was killed. I'm sorry. Everyone seems to have lost somebody. CONCIERGE: (ON INTERCOM) Paging Dr. Quintas. Telephone call. The house phone is there. Gracias. Could I order an English breakfast? Of course. Dr. Quintas, you have a telephone call for me. Thank you. Hello? RAMON: (ON PHONE) Sorry, Mr. President. No time to enjoy your breakfast. You settle up, and you leave immediately. I haven't even started yet. I've got to eat. Leave at once. It's an emergency. CARLOS QUINTAS: (ON PHONE) What emergency? Well, it's your life, Carlos. We're doing our best. [MUSIC PLAYING] The situation is hotting up and getting dangerous. Look, I can't risk your life any longer. I'm getting someone else to look after Carlos. You're certainly not. I can take care of myself without the help of your patronizing chauvinism. Hold on, Kate. No, you're misunderstanding me. We need you in the office to back Inez up. It's a high-priority position. Who's going to work with Carlos? RAMON: (ON PHONE) I'm lining it up. Then meanwhile, I'll work with Carlos, and I think you should ask his opinion. [CHATTER] Hello, how are you? We are fine, thank you. And you? Hello. Could you sit? Thank you. Stupendous. What a man! What a president! He's so important for friendship and collaboration with the Russian people. President Quintas is joining us? No, he's had to do TV, and some other interviews. He apologizes, and asks me to represent the government in exile. You have the authority? You are in power? I am. The government is interested in your offer of financial aid. But they would like it in writing, official. Miss Webber-- what are they doing to us? They know these things are never put in writing. It's an act of trust in a totally untrustworthy world. I am not a capitalist. We are not capitalists. We are not in bondage to the fetish of the contract. I knew it. I told you. Americans [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] They've already been bought by the Americans. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] We shall be sent to the gulag. I need a drink. Comrade waiter, three White Russians, please. Thank you. It's really not like that. They are interested in your offer. But the contract must be negotiated properly. I know they need the money, especially with this Pickwick development. You are not playing with us? No, they're serious. I hope so, Miss Webber. The facts of life are-- in today's world, there is no room for non-alignment, and no neutrality. There is a saying amongst poor countries in the UN. We're either raped by the American eagle, or gangbanged by the Russian bear. (CHUCKLES) Nikolai puts it crudely, so there are not misunderstandings. You have to make a choice. CARLOS QUINTAS: What is the emergency? RAMON: We needed to know if you'd been picked up at Inez's office and followed. You were. CARLOS QUINTAS: How did you know? RAMON: A team of three. The watchers were watched. Mind you, . our boys felt that they also were being watched. Funny, eh? You carrying the gun? CARLOS QUINTAS: Yes, but I don't know how to use it. No problem. It's like a nuclear deterrent. If you need to use it, you'll be too late. Just look at her. What a town! What women! Ramon, how did those guys shadowing me get onto me? Don't you worry about it. I'm getting you a bodyguard. What about Kate? Uh-huh, she's a security risk. We'll have to stop working with her. You saying she's betraying us? You're crazy. Amigo, whenever anything's happened, Kate's been there. We can't take chances. Of course, working with me, she knows exactly what I'm doing. I trust her absolutely. Of course you trust her, you're in love with her. You are going to have to give her up. I refuse. She goes, I go. That's it. It's your skin, hombre. Yes, I don't like it. Especially now, since we have to wage this propaganda war. Propaganda. I'm a poet, Ramon, not a politician. No, don't be a politician, be yourself. No, you speak from the heart. Six months ago, our country was living in a democracy. Our government was committed to social change, to improving the lives of the poor, their housing, medical care, education. Well, that doesn't sound very controversial. What happened was the military took fright. A junta seized power, murdered the president, imprisoned political leaders, banned trade unions, censored the press, in the brutal repression of all human rights. So you are now calling for a complete ban on all loans and aid to the junta? The most effective means of isolation is economic isolation. So we are calling upon Britain and its European partners to support our campaign. REPORTER: Dr. Quintas, thank you. Ah, Kate. There's a bit of a problem. What? [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMS] Carlos. Darling, talk to me, it's Kate. RAMON: A spokesman said President Quintas is fighting for his life. Colleagues in the government are confident that his resilience and tenacity will prevail-- no, make that succeed-- in his fight for life and victory, over the brutality of a dictatorship that failed to silence his uniquely beautiful voice. Got it? Yes, it is a bit flowery. [PHONE RINGS] We're a poetic bunch here. Bye. Hello? Yes. I can. Say a colleague in the government. No, no comment on that. We do not know if President Quintas was the intended victim. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] CARLOS QUINTAS: Come in. Dr. Quintas. How relieved I am to see you survived. You know, for a while there, I was worried. How are you? It was nothing, Mr. Morrisey. Just a flesh wound. How fortunate. You know, I hadn't realized how dangerous your position is. That makes my offer more urgent. Have you made a decision? What can I say, Mr. Morrisey? It's difficult. It's my Latin American temperament, my machismo. You see, if I accepted, people would think I was a coward. Slight scratch on the head, and I became frightened, took your money, and fled. Now, I could live with being thought a traitor. Never a coward. Machismo. What are you doing, Dr. Quintas? You're a sick man. I'm an angry one, Mr. Morrisey. Tell me, what do you playing at? Half a million dollars? As an advance. With royalties and residual rights, it could eventually be a million dollars. A million dollars. What was this for? Soften me up? Why couldn't you wait for an answer, Mr. Morrisey? Remove me, and save your little money. We had nothing to do with that. Nothing? What is the rationale of the dictatorship, Mr. Morrisey? How does it fit into the CIA's scheme of things? It's quite simple. Generals are excellent managers, ambitious, unscrupulous, and prepared to clear the decks, and create favorable trading conditions. That's what I don't understand about you Americans, Mr. Morrisey. You always want to make a safer business, but it always seems to go wrong. Why is that? You're intelligent people, yet it always seems to end in disaster. Always a fuck-up, Mr. Morrisey. Always the innocent who suffer. Why is that? Machismo, Dr. Quintas. People don't want to stick to the corporate plan. Like you, they get carried away. You've changed. You're beginning to act like a president. Very dangerous. I hope so, Mr. Morrisey. Because the new economic order law might be stopped. And there are reports of a growing resistance within the country. You have problems, haven't you? Mm-hmm. You know, Dr. Quintas, I'm developing a certain admiration for you. I like the way you fight fire with fire. If only we were on the same side. If only you would be reasonable. Machismo, Mr. Morrissey. Machismo. KATE WEBBER: (ON INTERCOM) Hello? Carlos. KATE WEBBER: (ON INTERCOM) Hello. What the hell are you doing? Carlos, what are you doing out of hospital? I'm fine. There's work to be done. They shouldn't have shot at me, Kate. And they shouldn't have endangered my girl. Now we're going on the offensive, and we're fighting back. Dr. Quintas! Dr. Quintas! Dr. Quintas, it is imperative we meet. I implore you. There must be a rapprochement. Your offer is being considered. It is too late for that. I have received orders, direct from Moscow. You must be assassinated. We have to talk. I thought you only imprisoned poets. So now back to the good old days, where you were liquidated your best poets? I know. Regrettable period. But President Quintas, you are allied with us. You could influence policy. They would listen to you. You could persuade them to release the imprisoned poets. That would be wonderful. You can put this in writing, of course? Thank you. Buenas. AUCTIONEER: 50 pounds. - Como esta? - Muy bien-- AUCTIONEER: 75 pounds. Graci. AUCTIONEER: 100. KATE WEBBER: Muy bien, usted? AUCTIONEER: 125. 150. 200. 250 pounds. 300. 350 pounds. --passar, por favor. Si. AUCTIONEER: 350. Sold to that gentleman for 500 pounds. Thank you, sir. May I have your name? SHERIDAN: Sheridan. Sheridan. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce our next guest auctioneer, who informs me that reports of his recent death are somewhat exaggerated. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Carlos Quintas, poet, president, defender of liberty. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. The next item is lot 32, an original cartoon, donated by Mel Calman. It's very good. We'll start the bidding at 50 pounds. An original cartoon that's published in Times-- it must be worth at least 25 pounds. Thank you. 30 pounds. Thank you. 35 pounds. Thank you. 40 pounds. Lady on the right. 50 pounds. Thank you, sir. 60 pounds. Thank you, sir. 70 pounds? Any increase on 60 pounds? An original Calman, sold for 60 pounds to the bearded gentleman. Name, sir? Calman. [LAUGHTER] The next item is lot 33. It's very original, very valuable. Original manuscript of the poem Caballero Solo by Carlos Quintas. Am I bid 100 pounds? Thank you, sir. Am I bid 200 pounds? Thank you again. 250 pounds? Thank you. Will anyone bid 350 pounds for this Quintas poem being optioned for this most worthy cause? Thank you, the lady who bid 250 pounds that bid against herself for 350 pounds. Before she changes her mind, sold for 350 pounds. This is a peaceful meeting. You are disturbing these people. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Would somebody please help me? We're being harassed by the police. Someone please restrain the police. We have been warned there would be a provocative incident. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [ICE CREAM TRUCK MUSIC] Glad you made it. Get in the back. Dr. Quintas, would you mind driving? I'm afraid I lost my license. Right. Sorry about this. All they had left in the motor pool. Usually for surveillance. All right? Why were the police trying to arrest us? Not arrest, just helping with inquiries. Top-secret documents. Twist your arm, track down the culprit. Dr. Quintas to be deported. Activities prejudicial to the security of the state. Then why are you helping? I told you, because I'm on the side of the underdog. The idea of it is wonderful. You few, taking on governments, the IMF, the death squad. It's remarkable. You might even succeed. With every policeman after me, it's impossible. Difficult, Dr. Quintas, but not impossible. CARLOS QUINTAS: (VOICEOVER) Is it right, Kate, risking your life in somebody else's cause? Maybe we've shaken off the death squad. Maybe. Maybe they have us in their sights. I suppose it's safe, as long as we keep on the move, and they can't pin us down. God, what a dream Erotic? Very. What about? You. Good. [CONDUCTOR'S WHISTLE] [PLAYGROUND CHATTER] Jesus Christ, man. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] What is it? Jesus Christ, it's incredible. Aren't kids fantastic? I was thinking how simple life is for them. Wouldn't you like some? No. What is it, Cynthia? What's the matter? I can't carry on. It's impossible. Is the secrecy getting you down? I didn't expect to fall in love with him, you know. I just didn't feel that way about him. Does he know? He's no idea about me, us, about anything. So you have fallen for old Carlos the poet, no? Artists aren't my type. I like men of action, not the cerebral. Thanks. Ramon, I didn't mean it that way. I still like you very much. It's just that I love Carlos. It's such a mess. It's all right. ALFONSO: [SPEAKING SPANISH] I go first. Then Miguel. You follow. OK. Here we go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] What do you suggest we do, Dr. Quintas? Me for Kate. And no trouble? There's no point. Good. Vamanos. You mustn't take it so badly. This could have happened to anyone. I can live with that. What I can't live with is doing nothing. At least publicize what's happened. That will only make us appear helpless. When we know what they intend doing, then we act. Then it will be too late. It's already been 24 hours. Well, the sad truth is Carlos could die. But he's a realist. He knows that. That doesn't absolve us of our responsibility. At the moment, the situation is very fluid. Now we could jeopardize everything. Mm-hmm. What is it that I don't know? I don't want to go into any details. You have to accept that. No, I won't. I must do something. Kate, please. You have been very helpful. Now it's for the professionals. Hey, let's go and eat. Kate? Yeah. CARLOS QUINTAS: (VOICEOVER) It's interesting how life is at its simplest when it's at its most dangerous. All you want to do is save your own neck and survive another day. Otherwise, life isn't simple. Love isn't simple. Hola, hombre. I bet you're crapping yourself. Don't be embarrassed. It's only human. What's in store-- that's what you're wondering. You're just waiting for orders. You got me now, but you don't know what to do with me. Hey, Carlos, you know, you're a pretty bright guy. 'Cause that's exactly it, man. We're waiting for orders. Hey, but tell me. What was it like being a bitch? The president? You got a lot of exposure. And the babes. And Kate, ooh, isn't she something? She's got a great ass. Such a pity about her. It's a great pity about her. Ramon warned me off. Ramon warned you? [LAUGHTER] Ramon warned you? [LAUGHTER] You're right. Those goons are completely out of line. They're crazy, kidnapping him at a time like this. Wouldn't Carlos be better dead? No longer a threat to your generals? We want him alive. Sure, you don't believe that, hmm? But policy has to be flexible, sensitive to the situation. OK? There's a problem. What you got in mind? In the States, you call it a career move. Yeah, that's always an interesting possibility. Good. Then I'd like you to make a call. Could do. But would it impress my superiors? It's a chance to sign up a valuable author, very famous, very popular. I'll say just for you, Carlos. You take damn good pictures. Carlos, we're going to play American roulette. The rules are simple. [GUNSHOT] Yeah, would you tell the ambassador to call Morrissey? The publisher. Yeah, I'd like to talk them about one of my authors. Simple, isn't it? The first one to miss the picture-- and hit you loses. OK? $10. Third on the left. On the nose. [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHTER] $20, says top right, on the dimple. [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHTER] No, Morrisey's making his arrangements, and I'm meeting him at the embassy. Yeah. No, he's not going to double-cross us. It's the embassy he's double-crossing. Well, he likes to be in control. Yeah, I'll see you later. Bye. Is everything arranged? Inez is on her way. Excellent. Let's go and meet Mr. Morrisey. MIGUEL: I think you'll appreciate our next round. Bigger stakes. $100. $100! Top of the tree. Kate. Go. [GUNSHOT] Right ear. Hi! [GUNSHOT] How you doing? It's Carl Morrisey. Yeah, the military attache's expecting us. Thank you. Buenos tardes. Como esta? Bien. No peeping. Fire! I can assure you that you terrorists are living in a fantasy world. The generals have never been more popular. Yes, Miss, can I help you? Yes, please. We would like to hand this petition to the ambassador, please. - OK, just two of you. Rest of you stay where you are. Buenos dias. [SPEAKING SPANISH] But what have you got to negotiate with? In return for President Quintas' liberty, you'll receive a free pardon. You'll then be able to serve under president's democratic government. I can't believe this. Why should I negotiate? We are in power. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Alfonso. No, nada. Que? I don't believe it! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Let's go. Trouble? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Let's finish this first. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Please excuse me for a moment. A little matter to attend to. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] According to my fairy godmother, this is it. I'm with you. Carlos. Listen, please. Don't yell, don't protest. Don't say anything. Just watch. - She thinks of everything. - What is this? What does this all mean? Go, go, ssh, ssh. Tight there, huh? Timing's tight, we have to move. Come on, people. Move it! [INTERPOSING VOICES] Damn it. This way, come on. [INTERPOSING VOICES] It's not what you think. It's never what I think. Go. Left, left. Machismo, Dr. Quintas, machismo. Will Come on, it's easier than it looks. (LAUGHS) Well done, Kate. President Quintas. Where are you taking me? There are some new developments. What the hell is happening? Will you please trust me? Go back to the flat. It's OK. My man Riggs will look after you. - Please. - I'll explain. - I'll talk to you. - In the car. [PHONE RINGS] I'll take this one. No time for last farewells. We've got to get them to the airport. Will one of you explain what's going on? We're going home. You can't. Why are you letting them do this? That's right, you tell him, Kate. He wants to give up and stay. Stay where? What, didn't you know? There's been a bloodless coup, and the dictatorship s been overthrown. By who? Some younger officers. They want Carlos back as president until the elections. I'm not going. He has to see it through. I can't do it, Kate. Of course you can. [WHISTLE] Well, I'm off, Kate. Thanks for everything. Yes, I'll always remember. Bueno, Carlos. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [LAUGHTER] At once, Senor Presidente. See he's on it, Kate. You've succeeded. Be realistic, Kate. When it's revealed that I was supported by the CIA, what credibility would I have? Isn't it obvious, Carlos? Morrisey's seeking influence with the new government. And you approve of that? It was you who argued that noble ends may involve messy means. Working with Morrisey was the only way of getting you out alive. Well, it's not that I'm not grateful. Good. Then give the future a chance. What about our future? Where do we stand? Nothing's going to happen unless you see it through. You said you'd never go with the president. Maybe I can't, maybe I can change my mind. A girl can do that, you know, Senor Presidente. You don't give a guy much choice. It's a choice. If I go, you'll come see Ramon and me? Ramon and you? What about Inez? Doesn't she count? Now you see how I need you? Keeping me up on the mark. Inez is now the new ambassador to London. President Quintas, they won't wait any longer. Turn it over now. Go on, President Quintas. Call me from palace. I'd like that. I'm going, but I'll sending you a ticket. I'll be sending it back. I pay my own way, remember? Yes. Goodbye, Miss Webber. Bye, Carlos. So you'll be seeing the president again? I just might. By Jove, that'll be a night to remember. What a rogue you are, Screech. The rescue was quite unnecessary. You don't appreciate the danger he was in. Besides, I had to find some way of getting you together again. Screech, you are an incorrigible romantic. Won't you call me Gerald? CARLOS QUINTAS: (VOICEOVER) Kate, I will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses. I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees. [MUSIC PLAYING]
