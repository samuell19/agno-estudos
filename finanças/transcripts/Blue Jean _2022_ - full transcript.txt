Ladies and gentlemen, it's "Blind Date". And here is your host, Miss Cilla Black! Thank you! Hello and welcome to "Blind Date", the show that tries to find a boy and a girl who go together like birds of a feather. Will the billing and cooing lead to wooing? Or will the day they both met be the day that they'll regret? It's been quite a week for clashes and confrontations in the arts. The British Prime Minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher became the patron of an admirable new scheme to get business and industry to sponsor the arts at the same time as the Conservative Government that she heads was under fire from prominent figures in the arts world. The bone of contention is a clause, Clause 28... If you're just joining us, this is Peter Brackley. Welcome to "Sports Report". FA Cup, sixth round: Everton two, Ipswich Town one. Tottenham Hotspur nil, Liverpool one... # Give me courage When the world is rough # Keep me loving Though the world is tough... # What? I could forge your nan's signature better, Siobhan. -But I didn't. -Do you want me to call her? No. Don't. If there's a problem at home, you can tell me, you know? Can't have my star player missing any more matches, can I? OK. I'll call her. You and your bloody fan club! Carol. Would you prefer to take the class yourself? OK. Erm... Can anyone tell me what "fight or flight" means? I'm not just talking about netball. "Fight or flight", any ideas? Carol? You can see me after, OK? There you go. Instincts. I'm talking about instincts. The body responds far quicker than the brain. Faced with sudden danger, the body begins to respond before the brain has even thought about it. Steak pie, that, man. What you having for dinner? Don't, man, honestly. Martin's got us on this new diet. Have you heard of it? It's called "SlimFast". Just one of these in the morning and one at night. Martin says I'll be wasting away by Easter. Oh, God. Ah, dear... Nah. This, man. -That's horrible. -That's minging. I want that, though. -Hiya. -Oh, hello. -How are you? -Hiya! Yeah, OK. Hey. -Hiya. -Hey. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! -Oh, come on, Baby Jean. -Right, stop...stop calling me that. -Come on. -It suits ya. Lightweight! Lightweight! This is exciting. Out my way. All right, then, love. Have a lickle stretch. -Excuse me. -That's... I'm not having this. Oh, no. Oh... stop it. What? No way! Nice shot. There she is! I'm bored. It's not over till the fat lady sings. Well, I'm the fat lady, and I'm calling it! Now someone get us a drink! -Drink, drink, drink! -Go on, Jean. -Your go. -Your turn. -Me? -Teacher, you won. -I got the last one. -I know, but the winner gets the drinks in. # Duh-nuh-nuh, nuh, nuh # # Duh-nuh-nuh, nuh, nuh # Thanks, love! Hello! Oh, no. Please. No, not that again. I need it. You're sick in the head, you know that, don't you? I would just like you to imagine as you lie there that the body is powering down, ready to sleep for the night. Allow thoughts to come and go, but begin to notice the sensation of the muscles in your legs switching off. Any second now, she's gonna get clattered. He's gonna take her down and she'll come crying to me. Why is he so boisterous? Look at that. -Well, that's a waste, isn't it? -Why's that? Well, she'll not be needing footwork like that on a netball court. Well, you could always sign her on. And you'll take the boys for netball, too, will you? I don't see why not. -Abigail Dawson. -Yeah, Miss. -Mindy Singh. -Yeah, Miss. Lois Jackson. Does anyone know where Lois is? - Who? - Dunno. -Gary Blakefield. -Here, Miss. Christopher... Lois! Lois? Come on in. I'm Miss Newman. Have youse got your kit yet? -No. -Er...that's OK. We'll find you something. Michelle, do we... - Can I just watch? - Can you just watch? Is there something funny, Mike? -Nah, Miss. -OK, then, grow up. Erm... Yeah, OK, you can sit this one out, but in future, it's not really optional. I need you in two teams. Jimmy, can you get over here? Mike, over there. Come on, then, guys. One, two, three, bulldog! That's it, Mike! Come on! One, two, three, bulldog! One, two, three, bulldog! Come by the office tomorrow. I'll sort you out with some kit. All right? -You thought about joining the netball team? -No. You could come along later and get a feel for it, if you like. -Have you played? -No. But I know you can't run when you've got the ball. I reckon you'll be good at it. Nah, I'm good. Let me know if you change your mind. What? Nothing. Oh...really? Am I distracting you? No. Just quite loud. Oh, yeah? How loud? Sounds like you're snoring. No, it doesn't. Come on, show us what it's like. Ladies and gentlemen... Wow! OK. ...Miss Cilla Black! Oh, no, no way. What? -No way. We're not watching that. -Why? "Oh, Kevin! If you fall for me, I promise I'll suck your cock every week and never ever emasculate you in front of your friends." You do realise they fill our tellies with this here to distract us from what's really going on? Such a conspiracy theorist. I'm telling you. Not everything is political. Of course it is. Who's that? How should I know? Erm... Er...hang on. Oh, shit. -What's going on? -It's...it's my sister. Can you just...you know? Fuck. Sorry, Jeanie. I tried ringing. Erm... Tim's mam's been taken to hospital. They think she might have had a stroke. Could you watch our Sammy? I don't think it'll be too long. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course, yeah, that's fine. Oh, really? Thank you so much. You're a star. Yeah, we'll be OK, won't we, Sammy? Don't go all shy on us. Say hello to Auntie Jean. If you're lucky, I'll let you watch cartoons before bed. - How's that? - Thank you. -OK. -Thank you. OK. Right, off you go. Love you! Bye! Bye. Bye-bye. His gran's just been rushed to hospital. They didn't want to take him with them. Who's that? Sammy, this is my friend, Viv. Viv, this is Sammy. Hiya. You can watch telly for five minutes, OK? And then I'll take you up to bed. Sorry. "Friend", is it? -Well, he's five. -And? Don't. Don't what? Well, don't tell me how to be with my own family. OK. I'll, er...call you tomorrow, then? OK. Enjoy your cartoons. "I like women to be feminine. "What is the most feminine thing about you?" Hmm... Right, come on, then, Sam. Bath time. It's not finished. I don't care. Quickly! Up you go. Hey. Stop that! Stop it! Right, that's it! Hey. Hey, it's OK. It's OK. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you. Good boy. - Shall we read a story? Yeah. - Yeah. What do you wanna read? Superman. Me, too. -Ready? -Yeah. Come on, then. Hello? I'm sorry. Oh, yeah? What for? For being an idiot. Right. Meet me by the holiday park on Blyth Road in half an hour. Why? What is it that scares you? All of it. Well, you're not backing out now. -Are you OK back there? -Look at the road! Wait for me! Whoo! You can phone the organisers on 0-1-8-3-7-6-6-6-6. That's 0-1, if you're calling from outside London, 8-3-7-6-6-6-6. Lucy? In Haringey, positive images of homosexuality prompted a violent response from protesting parents. The New Clause is a group of Conservative MPs' response. The central provisions are that homosexuality must not be promoted in state schools, and it outlaws teaching the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship. The bill... What does that even mean? "Pretended family relationships". The clause is expected to go through substantially unchanged, not least... I found myself lying the other day. I had to call one of the kids' parents and I got... I dunno. And I told her I was my boss. I didn't plan it or anything, but I felt like if I had... ...told her it was me, she might think... There's something going on between you two? Yeah. Between me and the kids. -It's stupid. -No, it's not stupid. You know that's what they want, though, don't you? -Right, love. What can I get you? -Fish 'n' chips. -Do you want peas or beans with that? -Er, peas, please. -Won't be long. -She's friendly. This is not a beauty parlour. Get cracking, please, ladies. How would you know what a beauty parlour looks like? We were all young and dumb once, you know, Carol? You did a good job out there, Rachel. If you carry on like that, you'll be able to take on the sixth-formers by the end of term. You should be dressed by now. Come along, ladies! Urgh, Miss, what you looking at? Get out, you perv! Fancy a pint? A few of us are heading down the Lodge. Sorry? Er...no, I can't. I'm, erm... I'm minding my nephew tonight. Friday night? Hope they're paying you. -See ya Monday. -See ya Monday.

Yeah, I'll, erm... I'll have you shadow Siobhan today. Help you get to grips with the basics. -Fuck's sake. -You got a friend. Can you take that jumper off, please? Uniform only on this team. Here! Here! Here! That's enough. Now, who's gonna show Lois how we defend without contact? - Siobhan. - Fuck's sake. Mindy, come here. Three feet apart. Arms in the air. Hands following the ball. OK. Well done. Lois, you wanna give it a try? It's OK. We'll go slowly. You position yourself more like this. Three feet apart. Arms in the air. Hands following the ball. Well done. Meeting at four o'clock tomorrow outside school. Please don't be late or I'm leaving without you. Thank you. Well done. Well done. See you back here tomorrow, then. Hello, PE department. Hang on. Call for you, Jean. -Who is it? -Didn't say. Jean Newman speaking. Why, hello, Baby Jean. Hello? Jean? Spoke to Baldock this morning. He's approved those proposals you put forward. I know. I couldn't believe it either. See ya later. -Bye. -Bye. Aye, all right. -Oh, hiya. -Hey. Is Viv around? Yeah, she's just in there. Hiya. You can't call me at work. I told you that. Ugh, why do you have to be so uptight? Do you know what? Yeah, I don't need this. Hey. You don't know what it's like for me. I won't call you at work. OK. Are you gonna shut that door, cos you're letting the draft in? -It was open when I got here. -No, it wasn't. -Yes, it was. -Ah, shut up. Come on. Are you hungry? There's pasta. Er...no. I'm fine. Great. I said you were uptight. You're not uptight. Maybe just a little. Oh, fuck. Come here. -What? -Erm... ...nothing. Er... -Sorry, did I frighten you? -Hmm? -I'm a bit nocturnal. -No. It's OK. Be a good one for your students. Have you read it? I haven't. Says here it was banned for obscenity. Yeah, they thought it'd lead to an epidemic. Epidemic of what? Lesbianism. Hmm. Crazy, right? See ya later. # Tonight # There'll be no darkness tonight... # Let your love light shine bright # Listen to my heart... # Save it for the match, why don't you, Siobhan? Come on, we're just having a bit of fun, Miss. Here! Let's go! Here! Well done! Well done, Siobhan. - Here! - Here! Pass it! Is it her arm? Can you put any weight on it? No. You're on. You'll be fine. Try not to think too much. Well done, Lois! Look at that! Congratulations. Well done. I wish you'd let us come to one of your games. You wouldn't have to talk to us. I'd just like to be there. What? What, you don't think I'd blend in with the other parents? Stick out like a sore thumb, more like. Hey, that's not kind. Anyway, I bet there are loads of lezzas on your team. Well? -Well what? -Oh, come on. I don't ask them who they're sleeping with. No, but you can just tell. I really haven't thought about it. You're from another planet, you. Is that right? This afternoon's business in the House of Lords was brought to an abrupt halt by three young women, who launched a commando-style raid on the chamber. They abseiled down ropes from the public gallery, landed on the floor among a chamber full of startled peers and were hustled out by Black Rod and several doorkeepers. It was a protest against the clause in the Local Government Bill, which curbs the promotion of homosexuality by councils. We care on this side, first and foremost, about children. We care about the perpetuation of the heterosexual normal family as the basis of civilised society here and in other countries. Hear! Hear! Well, David Koss is in our Westminster studio now. David, exactly what happened? You wouldn't wanna bump into them women in a dark alley. They'd have your guts for garters, wouldn't they? Eh? I've been saying this is a good idea for years. Young people have such vulnerable minds. Well done today, ladies. Time to get changed. Oh, gross, man! So gross. What about you, Lois? What's your type? - Yeah, what's your type? - Yeah, howay, tell us. Yeah, what's your type? No, wait. You prefer them a bit more... Fuck off. Or is it the mannish ones that do it for ya? Whatever. Oh, come on, we've just been saying what we like. Now it's your turn. Fair dos. Yeah, come on. Tell us, Lois. What I don't get is how two girls actually... Like, I know there's a lot of this. How do you actually...? No denying it, then? -Or maybe she's a virgin. -Probably. -I'm not. -Liar. Do you think I'm sexy? Don't touch me, you fuckin' dyke! Ow! Get off! Get off! Ow! Get off! Get off her now! My office, now. You can stay here and explain to me what just happened, all right? -Whatever. -Go! Now. Show's over, ladies. Come here. Ow. You've got a chance to really succeed on this team. Do you even care what happened? Just ignore them. Is that what you did? No. We're not talking about me. You need to be careful. That's all I'm saying. If it comes to it, your word against hers... you know who they'll believe, don't you? So it doesn't even matter what happened? Look, I could get you thrown out permanently for that kind of behaviour. I know it seems unfair. But I'm trying to help you. If you want this, fight for it, not against it. Hey... Hey, don't! Oh, no, what happened? Er, it was just a graze. -You all right, pet? -I'm fine. Poor love. Yeah, she's OK. All sorts of rumours flying around about that one. Not sure she helps herself, though. Everything OK with you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, fine. Long day. Take it you don't wanna come for a pint, then? One day. One day, I will crack you, Jean Newman. And when I do, Fergus Shelton will be a very happy man. Yeah. My overriding concern is the promotion of positive images of homosexuality in schools and primary schools right through, and that is what is causing many parents real concern and offence. I obviously don't want children taught that the gay and lesbian lifestyle is natural or normal. It is not, it never has been, and it never will be. Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay. Here y'are, Jeanie. Can I have some? You won't like that, sweetheart. But I want it. Eat what you're given, OK, Sammy? But why? Well, Auntie Jean is allergic to chicken. But we're not. Sammy. That is enough, Sam! We do not behave like that in this house! What on earth do you think you're playing at?! You've just wasted perfectly good food... Sorry about this. I don't think so... It's OK. "At last, the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth "and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice." "'Who are you?' said the Caterpillar." "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. "Alice replied rather shyly, "'I hardly know, sir, just at present.'" "'At least, I know who I was when I got up this morning, "'but I think I must have been changed several times since then...'" Come on, Sammy. Let's go and play outside. But I don't want to. Well, you've been inside all day. I'm gonna count to three. One, two... We'll finish it another time, OK? Can I show you something quickly while they're out there? I bought something for Tim for our anniversary, but I need a second opinion. Thought I'd asked you to get rid of this. Ah, I love that one. You look so happy. Yeah, I know, I know. Please. I don't have any recent ones. -And I miss your hair like that. -You sound like Mam. How would you know? You never go and see her. I don't like seeing it there. -What? -I dunno, it's just... Well, it's not as if everything that came before is, you know, a lie. What are you talking about? I don't think it's right you wanna erase part of your life. And you expect us to. I thought I just asked you to replace one photograph. -You know what I mean. -Well, I don't, actually. You're trying to erase your marriage. Am I, now? Don't be a child. Why didn't you tell me you weren't alone the other night? What? Sammy told me you had a woman there. Look, what you do in your own home is your own business. You know I'm supportive of... it. But Sammy's only five. It's confusing for him. He wet the bed. He never wets the bed. His grandmother had just been rushed to hospital. I just don't think it's fair for you to put me in that position. She actually left right after you dropped him off. OK, but... Do you see? It's hard for me, well... to trust you. So... Come on, who is she, then? Got ya! -Bye, Auntie Jean! -Bye! -Bye! -Bye! -Hey. -Hiya. What's wrong? You look stressed. Thanks. Here. What's going on? Nothing. Just, erm... -shattered, you know? -Oh. Well, maybe we should go away. Cos the girls and I were actually talking about taking a trip... That a no, is it? Er, no. Er... no. Hey, lady. Hiya. Thanks. Wow, you seem...tense. That's what I said. Leave her alone, you lot. -Hey! -'Ey, the kid's good. Wanna play? Jean here's unbeaten. You can be on my team. Come on, it'll be fun. No, I don't... I don't really... -Can't take the heat. -Come on, Jeanie. -Jeanie! -Oi! Yeah! Ah, no! It's all over. Ooh. You can take it. No way. Finish her off. -Ohhh! -She did it! She fuckin' did it! Got your loser speech? Hey! What are you doing? You need to leave. Why? You know why. Do whatever you want. Wherever you want. But not here, OK? Why do you care so much? You're 15. You shouldn't even be in here. So what? Haven't told anyone, have I? Hey! Hurry up! Go. Otherwise, you're off the team. What?! Oh... Viv! Wait. Viv. Please! Just tell us what you were doing in there so I know. She's one of my students, she's on the team. What? -Are...are you... -No. Course not. Then why didn't you say something? I don't know. -You're lying. -I'm not. Look... It's complicated, OK? -I was asking her to leave. -In the toilet? Why? Why were you asking her to leave? I don't want my students knowing every part of my life. -"Every part" of your life? What... -Yeah. I don't know what you want me to say. You have to create boundaries as a teacher. It is part of the job. If anyone found out, I'd never work again. It's quite a stretch. -Don't you think? -No. It isn't. -And what about her? -Who? That girl. Come on, how old is she, what, 16? 15. What kind of example are you setting for her? That's not fair. None of this is fair. Just cos I don't parade my sexuality around like a badge of honour. And I do? Is that it? How is that girl ever gonna learn she has a place in this world if you, of all people, tells her that she doesn't? What makes you think she has a place in this world? -No. I can't do this. -Oh, Viv... GET OFF! # I see a ship in the harbour # I can and shall obey # But if it wasn't For your misfortune # I'd be a heavenly person today # And I thought I was mistaken # And I thought I heard you speak # Tell me how do I feel? # Tell me now how should I feel? I would just like you to imagine as you lie there that the body is powering down, ready to sleep for the night. Allow thoughts to come and... Got a sec? Found something on your desk when I got in this morning. Obviously, with everything that's going on, I didn't want anyone else to see it. But I thought you should know. Any idea who might have put it there? Erm... Er, yeah, I've got some ideas. Don't look so worried. I've had far worse in my time. I need to talk to you for a second. -Let me guess. I'm off the team? -No. Look, I need this to stop. -What? -All of it. This isn't a game, Lois. It's my job. It's my life. What is it you think I've done? -You know exactly. -Are you married or something? You think you're so brave, don't you? You don't know anything about me. Fuck! Good of you to join us, Lois. Perhaps you'd like to tell us how many elements make up the periodic table? -No? -What did she want? Anyone? She's got a massive crush on me and she won't drop it. Something you'd like to share with the class, Lois? No, Miss. Right. Textbooks open to page 93, please. Today. You don't actually think it was hers, do you? I thought she was married. Divorced, apparently. I didn't realise. Who broke it off, do you know? She doesn't really talk about it, to be honest. She's a secretive one, that one. Thought I might sit in on practice today. -If you don't mind. -Yeah. Course. Er, can we start with shuttle... ...warm-up, please? OK, well done. You can get your bibs. Miss? She took my bib. You can sub in for each other at half-time. -But it's my position. -It's just practice, Siobhan. -Give it back. -Piss off. Give it back! Give it back! Enough! Both of you! On the bench, now! -But... -But she started it! You answer back to me and you're off the team, OK? Me? What about her? Both of you, on the bench, now! Here! What are you doing? It's OK. Get off me! Siobhan! Siobhan! - Are you OK? - Give her some space. Get her out. Come here. Sit down. What's going on? Can someone tell me what's going on, please? She attacked me. What do you mean she attacked you? She shouldn't be allowed in here. Get her out! Get out! Get out, Lois! I'm gonna need you to supervise this lot so I can get her out of here. Come on, darling. She said that she attacked her. She needs to get kicked out! : She's saying this isn't the first time. That there was a fight a few weeks ago that you didn't report. She's even gone as far as to say there might be something going on between you two. You and Lois, that is. Jean, can you please tell me what's going on, or am I gonna have to take her word for it? Lois is, erm... She's become a little over-attached, you could say. If that's the case, why didn't you report it to me? I didn't think it was anything to worry about. You know what they're like. I've had worse. And the changing room? I saw something but, erm... What? What did you see? I saw them together. Siobhan pushing Lois off. Now, Miss Murphy, it's very important that we ascertain exactly what went on between you and Miss Jackson earlier today. We take these kinds of accusations extremely seriously. The perpetrators of sexual assault have no place in this school. Now, I don't want to keep you long. I just need you to repeat what you told the PE staff earlier this afternoon. I don't remember. Look, I know it isn't easy for you. So let me try and help, OK? Earlier, today, if you remember, you were very upset. I was in the hall when I heard you scream. I then ran into the changing room, where I found you in the corner very distressed. I took you to my office, where you told me that Lois had assaulted you. Is that right? No, it's not. Tell them! Lois! I'll need you to calm down. Just nod if that's what happened, my love. You just have to nod, my love. Well done. I see. You were there, Miss Newman? You saw what happened? Yeah, I did, yeah. Right. -What is wrong with you? -Er, that's enough, Lois. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call your father. -Don't bother. -Er, sit back down, please. Do you know, you haven't even asked me what happened. You've asked all of them but not me. If you've got something to say... You're the worst of the lot. And you know it. Let her go. One, two... Lovely. I lose track. Actually, no, I lie. He'd just turned two there. It was election night. Me and Bill were glued to the TV. Didn't notice him puking all over himself. You never wanted kids? Ah, you'd be a great mum. I see you with the younger ones. They're lucky to have you. Looks more like a Mr Whippy than a pint of Guinness. Watch us as we steal the show! T-Y-N-E-S-I-D-E, Tyneside! Here at home, there's been another demonstration against Clause 28 of the Local Government Bill, the clause which seeks to stop councils from promoting homosexuality. Well over 15,000 people marched through Manchester, clogging the streets before staging a rally in the city centre. As ordinary men and women, we demand the same rights, no more, no less. The same rights as other ordinary, civilised, human beings... Go away. -I need to talk to you. -I'm late for work. I can give you a lift. I'm fine walking. -Lois... -Why can't you just leave me alone? Do you actually think I attacked Siobhan? No. Then why? I know you want more from me, but it's not... I can't be that person for you. I never asked you to be anything. Not about what you ask, though, is it? I don't like women to use bad language. Very much against that, like. If you stub your toe or drop a teacup or something... ...what do you say? - Hi. - Hiya. Erm...thanks for coming. Of course. Want something to drink? Erm, yeah. Yeah, in a sec, thank you. Erm... Look... I'm really sorry. -It's OK. -No. No, it's not. I should've told you, and I should've done everything differently. Erm... Sick in the head, remember? She reminded me a bit of you, you know? First time we met. -Who, Lois? -That girl, yeah. No, she's nothing like me. Debs thought so, too, you know, like... like, erm... a deer in the headlights. I'm not a deer in the headlights, am I? Sometimes. You know... skittish. Skittish? Is it? Anyway... Do you want something to eat? I ate before. OK, yeah, I might. I'm sorry I didn't return your calls. -It's fine. -No, it isn't. Look, I've... been here before with Donna, and... Donna cheated on you with her husband. Yeah. Yeah, but, erm... ...in the end, it's the same. Because she wasn't ready. And... I...I can't do that again. -I'm gonna quit my job. -What? -Why? -Because... You...you... I don't think you should quit your job, because you love your job and you're good at your job. I did something terrible. That girl, Lois from the club... ...I dobbed her in to get her off my case. She's been suspended and I doubt she's coming back after this. I... I don't think you should be so hard on yourself. I wanna be with you, Viv. -We could go away somewhere. -No... Look, if we forget everything that's happened... then there will be something else. No. No, there won't. But... anyway, I don't want to go away, because I like it here. Like, I'm happy. Here. This isn't what I wanted, but I can't keep doing this. - You don't have to do this. - I'm sorry, but I can't. -Please, Viv... -I'm sorry. I can't. Come on, please. Viv, please! Excuse me. You cannot smoke in here, pet. Well, what is this here for, then? Punch! Police stations don't offer crèches for their employees. Why should hospitals? It's a ridiculous idea. No, what the nursing profession needs is more men. If nursing were perceived as a male and female occupation, the same as, say, teaching, or the civil service, there'd be a stronger gut feeling amongst the powers that be to raise nurses' salaries. -I hadn't thought about it like that. -In the meantime, what happens when our children get sick? And they're picketing outside the hospitals instead of doing their damn jobs. Well, quite. What's your take on all this, Jean? -Well, erm... -You must have an opinion. No, come on. That's enough. Tim, why don't you go refresh the punchbowl? God, half-term really drags, doesn't it? Feel like I'll need a holiday to recover. Tell me about it. Right, who wants to go play some party games? Sammy, you coming? We're gonna play party games. Go, go, go. Let's go, guys. It's been a nightmare. And it just drags on and on and on, and you know, each time the lawyers are involved, you're paying out, for them and the kids. Are they staying with their mum? Mostly, yeah, yeah. I mean, like...yeah. I'm lucky if I see them once a week. And you know, it's... I was, er, just telling Tim about my divorce proceedings. They're bleeding me dry, I tell you. You... You women don't realise how good you have it. It's just a joke. Bad joke. No offence meant. None taken. Jean went through all this a few years back. Oh, right. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, you're still in one piece, so that bodes well. Yeah, I quite enjoyed it, actually. Er, so, what do you do, Jean? -I'm a teacher. -Fantastic. -What do you teach? -PE. Right. That must be, er... Er, which school? Tyneside. Oh. That's a commute and a half, isn't it? You didn't fancy, er... -What's Sammy's school called? -St Christopher's. Yeah, St Christopher's. Jean actually used to teach at St Christopher's. -Oh? -I did for a while, yeah. What made you...? I got a bit sick of running into the kids in the local shop. Fair enough. You know, I'd never thought of that. It must be a right pain. Although, parent-teacher evenings... probably quite a good hunting ground for the recently divorced. Am I right, eh? Sorry. It's OK. You got a man on the scene at the moment, then, have you, Jean? No. I haven't, no. Ah, well. Well, I'm sure... I'm a lesbian. Right. I've actually got to head off. Erm... Can you give this to Sammy? Thanks for the party. I love the... Nice to meet you, Carl. Er, Craig. What are you doing? -Can you get in the car? -What? I wanna show you something, that's all, -and I'll drop you home after. -I'm grounded. Don't tell me you've been sticking to that. I don't even have to talk to you, OK? -Can you just get in? -OK. Where are we? Look... ...I'm damaged. OK? And in a way, you're not. Well, at least, you don't have to be. If I don't have to be, then why do you? I don't know. -Maybe it's too late. -It's not right. -Pretending. -Look, I don't expect you to understand. You're right. I don't. Look, people failed me. And now I failed you. I'm not trying to get myself off the hook or anything like that. But I see you carrying this... ...this thing. And you don't have to. You're the one with the problem. -Not me. -Yeah, I know. -I don't know why you think that... -Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know. I know what I did was wrong. You know... it was Siobhan that kissed me. Not that it matters now. Shall we go? -Hey, you came! -Hiya. -And who's this one? -I'm Lois. Hiya, Lois. Welcome. You a friend of Jean's then? Speech! I just wanted to say that as some of you already know, money's been a little scarce this year, but thanks to the heroic efforts of the Bog Fund... ...we were able to throw a little something together. So, Debs... my love... ...these are for you. From all of us. Well, technically not from us, but they are for you. Love you, babes. Happy birthday! - To the Bog Fund! - The Bog Fund! Now let's get fucked up! Hi, lady. - We missed you. - You all right? What's the Bog Fund? Right, so, say you get kicked out by your parents, or you can't pay your rent or summat, or you need a new pair of shoes, then you can ask for money from the Bog Fund. Wait, so, anyone can ask for money? Yeah, well, any poor lesbians from the North East. Babes, you don't have a drink. Let's get you a drink. I'll keep an eye on her. -Where's the money come from? -People like her. Lesbians with proper jobs. Teachers, lawyers, whatever. They can put money in to, you know, help out those who are more hard up. How old are you, anyway? You old enough for a drink? Yeah, all right. Come on, then. # Maggie, Maggie, Maggie Out, out, out! # Maggie, Maggie, Maggie Out, out, out! # Maggie, Maggie, Maggie Out, out, out! # Maggie, Maggie, Maggie Out, out, out! # Oh, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie Out, out, out! # Maggie, Maggie, Maggie Maggie, Maggie, Maggie # Maggie, Maggie, Maggie Out, out, out! # # I don't need anybody else # I'll never let you go # Because I love you so # I don't want anybody else... # How did we look?
