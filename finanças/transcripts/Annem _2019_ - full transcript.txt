Nazlı... Can you call me when you get there? The little bunny and its mother went back to the forest. The mother says, "don't go anywhere far from me... or you'll be somebody else's bunny" A big world rotates around a little kid... you only get that when you become a mother. People those who don't have a reason to live... find a reason for themselves. For my mother that reason was me. What are you cooking, Ms. Nazli? Come here mom... I made potato. Oh, how I love potato! You know what they say on a lucky day... "my mother-in-law loves me" Fill my plate. Ah... my compliments to you. Enjoy it, Ayşe mom. I was my mother's precious. Buzz off then! Ismail! You! I'll kill you! Wait, wait... my girl... She cared for me a lot... because she became a mother at a later age. Look, look... She was always worried for me. Look, how they toss them, bam! See that? She wanted to give me everything. Sometimes, things that she didn't have. Ah, Tahir brother... brother Tahir... will you fly Nazli up? Fly her up... up to the clouds! Come on... open your arms. Open them. Hop! You fly. Come on, dear... come on, honey. Nothing was impossible for my mother. When it was about me, she made the impossible "possible". She couldn't finish school, so she wanted me to go to school. She was always like... "don't end up like me, finish your school for your bread and butter" but she was the only one who wanted that. Osman, give me your plate. Oh dear... two more days and Nazli's school starts. You don't have to do anything... You can give me some money and I can take care of all her needs... Okay, Osman? Osman, you don't say anything... how are we doing this? Don't "Osman" me! What are you saying? No school! Don't you get what I say! I say "we have no money... no money" But you are stuck with that school thing. Of course I am! She must go to school. She shouldn't end up like you and me. Oh God! What is wrong about us? What would you become if your father hadn't given you to me? A doctor? What will she do after school in this village? A professor? She will go to school... and who knows, maybe she'll become a professor. We have one little kid. We have to cherish her, right? Get this... this girl will go to school. She will not! She will... Oh God... you are driving me crazy at this late hour... Give me that bread! Take it yourself. You are a stubborn woman! Hell you are! You ruined the food for me! My mother was a strong woman... She would stand against the whole world let alone my father. She said to my dad "This girl will go to school" and her words came true. Here comes the plane. Here comes the plane... Nazli... scarf down the bite... Childhood ends like the games we play... but I was always a child for my mother. Here comes the plane... here comes the plane... Mom, what are you doing? Plane? Really? Give me my bag. Here, take it... Like you have seen a plane! I haven't seen a plane? Tahir had a plane! You used to touch the clouds, girl. I was six. Mom! Mom, come on! We are getting late! I'll meet Meryem. Look... this coupon... I bet all my money on this. Once this baby wins, I'll get you a dairy. So you say that I'll live with animal crap all the time. Don't jinx it! Off you go! Don't worry, I won't stay! Mom, don't you hear me? I came... okay, okay... you are rushing me! Water was boiling... why did you wear this? Your coat is thin... you'll get cold. Come on, mom... we are getting late... You always do that! Hah... spinach. Yes, ma'am. - Hello... how much? - Five Liras... Five Liras? Is it made of gold? Yes, sis... the highest quality gold. Never mind him, mom. Let's go. That's not okay... it sprouts on the alleys and valleys. Well, these are the prices. Okay, okay... - Come on, let's go. - Wait, I'll buy that. Two kilos. This is all my money. Be okay with it. No way, sis... I need to make a living, too. It's okay... No way. I don't want spinach or anything. I'll buy bread for my family. And I am buying spinach for my family. What are you doing? What are you doing? You are fighting over a Lira! Enough! you are embarrassing me! This is the market place... we bargain here... it's like a tradition. I am sick and tired of you! Hell I am! Move! Move, let's go! Ah... welcome. Thank you. You could have waited and drink here at your home. What if you lose this job, too? Stop messing with my head! I've been driving for like ten hours! I am not a kid... don't preach me! Drink shit... Nazli, come here... your dad is here. Dinner time! What the hell is this? Does spinach go with Turkish Raki? Do you call yourself a housewife! Can't you put some meat on my plate?! I gave you tons of money! Where do you spend it?! I can't put meat on your plate! You are wasting the money on horses! Look, I am angry already! I'll beat you so bad! Do I have to report you for the money I earn! When did you earn money? Why don't I know about that? Stop pushing it! I already squandered... What? What are you saying? Here... Osman, no! Oh God! You! What the hell are you doing? Damn... damn you! - Shut up! - I won't! Shut up! - I will not! - Shut up! I won't shut up! What can you do about it? Bah! The geography teacher is talking with mom. She must be complaining about me right now. Girl, say something. Nazli? What is wrong? Mom and dad... they are driving me crazy. They annoy me. - Meryem? - Yep? I will never marry... you'll see. I hope I make my way into the university and go to Istanbul and never come back! Girl, just calm down... have some patience. You'll accomplish that. You are not like me. Your lessons are great, your grades are high. You'll see... you'll have your chance for the best schools. Nazli... Yes? - I've got something to tell you. - Yes. You don't get mad at me if I marry, do you? Marriage? At this age? With whom? Cemal from our class... that tall fella... Girl, he is super handsome! He gives me that look in break times... and I feel like... you know... I hope we get married very soon. Let's take a look at the wedding dresses, shall we? Okay. Hey, don't lose that smile ever! Nazli... Yes? Aunt Ayşe is coming. - Mom! - Nazli... What are you doing here? How can you come like "this"? What is wrong? Don't worry, Nazli... I am fine. Teacher Zehra shouldn't think that you have no one. What are you saying, mom? Don't you join the parents meeting with this outfit! Are you trying to embarrass me? Is that what you want? I wasn't going to join the meeting... I was going to talk with your teacher right there outside and leave. You got me wrong. She wanted these grape leaves... your teacher... Oh, you still talk about leaves. Mom, get out of here... please... you are embarrassing me. Am I embarrassing you, Nazli? Well... if you are... - Give that to me... - Ah, good girl. Tell her that we have more... if she likes, I can get her more. Take this, too. You can eat it when it's still hot. Don't be hungry. - What happened? - Nothing. Are you alright? - Nazli? - Yes... Is the village really bad? Don't you like that place at all? Oh God... there is nothing to love there. Why do you say that? You have me. I only have you. Yes, and I mean the whole world! Nazli... Yes? You keep saying that you'll go but will uncle Osman let that happen? Bah! I am not asking him! He has never been a good father to me. I don't need his permission. Damn you! I won't give you that! Get out of here! How dare you tell me to leave my own house! Who the hell you are? Who do you think you are? I will kill you! Dad, what are you doing? What the hell are you saying? How can you two question me! It's too late! Where the hell have you been?! A daughter can't come home after her father! I was with Meryem! At this hour? Stop! For God's sake! You are spoiling this girl! Hell you are doing that! You are driving me crazy! Nazli? Are you scared? Are you? Don't be! That's your father... He goes berserk first... then he cools off! Come here, darling... come, sit... come dear. Sit... Why are you doing this, mom? What? Why don't you just leave him? And go where, Nazli? I don't have a house... I have no parents... no money... But you can't live like this. If I were you, I wouldn't stop for a minute. That's right... I wouldn't, either. Do you know why I couldn't go in the first place? Because of you. Because of me? You could have taken me, too. Where, Nazli? Who could have welcomed a woman with a little baby? Huh? This is lovely... we have a roof above us, our shelter. Then you could have left me. Is that possible? Blood is thicker than water, girl. If I had left you, you wouldn't have gone to school... It was going to be off the table. You would have ended up his servant here for the rest of your life. Or he would have married you off to someone before sixteen. But... you know what, Nazli? What? I won't let anyone eat you up! I'd die for you... I wouldn't let anyone harm you! Would you like eggs with onions? You sweet girl... I'll do it... My mother had to make a choice between her life and me. I did it! I did it! What is it girl? Oh girl! You did it! My girl... I'm so happy like it happens to me! Which school? I'll be a teacher, Ayşe Sultan! I'll be a teacher! Oh God! Oh God! Thank you! Oh dear! At last! At last, I'll leave this place! I will... Nazli? Which school, Nazli? A school in Istanbul. Was there no other school closer? Mom... Anyway... you'll do great in school! Osman! Osman! Stop! Stop! Why are you yelling? Osman, your daughter has become a teacher! We'll go like, "Ms. Teacher, hey, Ms. Teacher" Okay, fine... don't overreact. Nazli... Well... what do you need? You need a luggage. Duriye's daughter or niece was there... What was her name? God... you should pack up your luggage... and I'll spread the good news. Neighbors! Neighbors! Mom did it at last. She stood against my father's stubbornness... and sent her daughter to college... Her dream came true. Look, there is a cat here. Alright not this one. Ah, look at this. Mom, no need to buy that... it's expensive. Your father gave all that money... take anything you want. Did my father give us money? Congratulations Nazli... you passed the college entrance exam. Thank you sister Hacer. Thank you Hacer dear. And she is on the top hundred... thousand? At very... top... Did my father really give us money? He would give us money if he had... but he didn't, so I... never mind, look! How is it? Like a state employee dress. It's nice... yeah... My daughter passed the college entrance exam. Will she get cold in this? No, no ma'am... she won't get cold... it's made of cotton. She shouldn't get cold... university is somewhere different. What did Meryem do? She couldn't pass... Ah... not everyone has to become a teacher, right? What are you doing, mom? She will hear us. I'll go to Meryem's house tonight? Why are you going there? You are a teacher now... stop seeing ignorant people. Mom... You are unbelievable! Osman, you've never driven this thing as slowly as this before! What is wrong? A leg cramp or what? Twenty minutes for the bus, Osman! Yes, we should go faster... Shut up will you! Do you want me to make an accident? Ah, Nazli... I get it. She doesn't want to leave his daughter. Stop doing that for God's sake! This is all weirdly new! A girl should stay with her family! Why is she going to Istanbul?! Osman, how many times do I have to tell you? Duriye's niece is there... She says we can entrust our daughter to her because Nazli is like a relative. What more can she say? It's far... it's too far. Come on! Three, maybe four hours of drive. And I'll keep an eye on her. I'll go there often and stay with her. We won't leave her unguarded! And I say, hit the gas! We can then go to Istanbul in three hours and hand her our daughter. Come on, mom! Give it a rest! Don't you know your mother! She never listens. I need to take this truck back at three! And she says "let's go to Istanbul" to annoy me! Give this truck back for once and all! It's not moving! I speed up! Look, this one... wait! Take them only. Mom, what are you doing? Keep an eye on this, okay? Mom, what did you put in this? I am going to school... I am not eloping! Olives... in its oil... that makes it heavy. And some bulgur. I could buy olive from Istanbul. You should spend your money for books and school stuff. Hide your money... Ah, wait... take this... Here is the address. You'll go to Nesrin and call me right away, okay? Okay... the bus is taking off... I should go. My dear... Mom, don't do this... Mom, it's okay. We have five minutes. Mom, don't cry. Wait, wait... Take this, too. What is this? Nesrin's address... I made a copy. Put it in a different pocket. - Okay, mom... okay. - Put it... You look beautiful. Button this up... Nesrin shouldn't go like... "Ayşe's daughter came to Istanbul with a dowdy dress" Come on, woman! Give her some peace. Tell her to put it in her bag. Oh God! Look what your father got for you... Nazli. Her father... kiss his hand. God speed your way. Thank you, dad... I'll go now. Nazli, do you want some water? Cologne? Cologne! Enough, woman... Everything I had was left behind. I thought, going away from the village I was born in means a journey to myself. Once you get rid of your roots, will you reach the sky faster? Time will show that. When you said you were accepted from a school in Istanbul... I was both happy and scared, I won't lie... I said "what will she do there all alone?" "How will she survive?" "Who will take care of her if she gets sick?" All alone in that big city... how will you survive there... You won't give up... you'll go to school and become a teacher... You'll raise kids like yourself. You'll make a living... you won't need anyone. Don't trust everyone there. Don't believe everything people tell you. Watch out for yourself. Maybe not much but I saved this for you. I saved it every day dime by dime. This is all I could do... I wish I could give you more. But this is all I got. You are my precious, apple of my eye. God speed your way... Nazli, my dear. Here you are... enjoy your meal. - Hello... - Hello... I am here to see Aunt Nesrin. Ouch! Don't call her "aunt" or you can't use those eyes to see anything! So, why did you want to see her? I am... I am Ayşe Toprak's daughter. Ah, Nazli! Welcome. Nesrin, come... look who is here. She has been waiting for you, lass! Come with me... Sis, over here... look who is here? Alright, calm down will you! Okay, okay... Who did you drag here this time? Welcome, who are you? Sis... I am Nazli. - Nazli? - Ayşe Toprak's daughter. Ah, sister Ayşe's daughter. Welcome... welcome... Ah, Nazli, where have you been? Your mother has called like thousand times! Call her... she is worried sick. Sis... I was going to call her... but I couldn't start the phone. What? Dad... he got this for me because I was coming to Istanbul. It's new. Okay... let's go inside... you can call her inside. Come with me... it's okay. Thank you, sis. Tolga Yildiz will ride Izbeli. They will start the race in the eighth stall... They put on the horse earplug. Oh dear! Hello, Nazli... why didn't you call? I thought you were kidnapped... I thought something went wrong... I thought of all the terrible possibilities. Girl, I've kept calling you... you haven't answered... I thought they sold your father the lousiest phone... he doesn't know anything about phones. Mom, calm down... just breathe. I am in Istanbul and I'm fine. I found sister Nesrin. Thank God... give my best to her. Nazli... where will you stay tonight? Did she invite you to her home... or will you sleep on a mattress at her workplace? I don't know... I've arrived a minute ago. Don't be shy. She is like from our village... Tell her that there has been a problem with the dormitory and ask her. Mom, okay... I'll talk to her. I'll go now... this place is crowded. Ah, now it's working. You couldn't place the card in it... that's why you couldn't start it. Thank you, sister Nesrin. You are welcome... join me when you are ready. Okay. And this place is Aunt Neriman's house. She passed away last year. Her sons entrusted this place to me to clean up and stuff... but I couldn't... Where is the light switch? Ah here... A house like a little box... you'll be fine. Look, the kitchen. Not bad... it will suffice, right? You can heat the place easily... it will be very hot, believe me. It's a bit odd but I' think it's fine... we can tidy up the place. Sis, this is a nice place. Sister... thank you... I would be homeless if it wasn't for you. Don't even mention that. You'll be at school in the morning, then you'll come to the café for work. You'll come here only at nights to sleep. Sister, I promise... I'll pay you with my first salary. Don't say that... you can pay, I know. And if you don't, I can cut it from your wage. I am the boss after all, right? Right? I am the boss, yes! Hello, Nazli Hello, mom. Nazli, why are you up? Is something wrong? Tell me the truth. No... I just... couldn't sleep. They ripped the raw fruit from the tree... They took my girl, Nazli... My girl survives... or when I die, I can't close my eyes... My girl survives... or when I die, I can't close my eyes... Over here... hot bagel... over here... I have hot bagel... CHILD DEVELOPMENT 1 Istanbul started to get along with me... and I started to get along with her. But if you don't like the city, it's a hard place to put up with. - Here you are... - When I came here... it was like, everything changed with a magical want... but life always has surprises in store. Look, look over here... There is a bird... with a gigantic diamond on its head. It's over here. I hope that bird won't crap on us! God, I want that diamond ring... or I'll end up in menopause soon. Okay, I'm done... tell Nazli's fortune. Give me your cup. Oh dear... if you see something bad, don't tell me... I'll be scared. Ah, I am not an oracle. I'll utter a few things and we'll share laughter. Let me see! Oh dear... her good luck bursts out before I turn the cup over. Praise be... oh, sis... all I see is fortune. Look at those fish... see? I am not making it up. It's like there is a road here. Will you go back to the village? Ah, this is love... Are you going to fall in love or what? Love? Village? No, God forbid! Ah, ah... Look, I tell what I see. Mom always says, "avoid big words or they will come true" I think, we say big words about everything that fears us. What's going on? What? You'll break the door. You are leveling the house! What are we going to do about that? Give it a rest! It's just some repair work. Just some repair work? I can't study in my place... I had to come here and... Too much noise! We can't hear each other. Look, I need to finish this place today. Go, turn on your TV and you won't hear a thing. Do you think everyone owns a television? You should say sorry instead of giving an advice. When I saw Mert first, I was like, "an off-putting smart-ass" But after that... Hello... Hello... It's me again. Well, we... we didn't know that someone was living upstairs... So we turned off the heating system. It's cold outside. Sorry... I got this for you... maybe you need it. So kind of you... you didn't have to... Don't even mention... I'll put it here. You can use it if you need it. I am Mert by the way. Nazli Nazli. If you need anything, I'm always downstairs. Just call my name. Okay. It all started like that. Mert first entered my house... then my life... then my heart uninvited. Ah, Ayşe... we are making all this food but... how can Nazli eat everything alone? She will explode if she eats everything we make. Take some of the food home. Meryem can eat... so can your husband... So Nazli will be a teacher of what? A general teacher. I hope nothing happens to her in Istanbul. All the jerks, rascals and vagabonds come together in Istanbul. I saw that on the news... one the girl was... any way, I better not say it. You never say good things... at least you should avoid saying bad stuff... There are fancy girls in Istanbul. No one will look at Nazli. What is wrong with Nazli? Use some flour... the dough will stick your hand. Excuse me. Mom? Nazli, what's up dear? Are you alright? What is it, mom? Why do you sound like that? Did you get sick there? No, no I'm fine, mom. Can I call you later? I can't talk right now. But... Hello... it's charge is, you know... Now I hear you, yes. Why did you hang up? You could have talked. Are you shy because I am around? Girl, you'll be the best I know. Never mind... come on... Oh, she is like her mother! She wants to have the best grades like me! Like her mother is a professor! Elementary school dropout! I am listening, dear. Give me that. That's mine... that's mine. Girl, why are you shaking me off on the phone? You always call in the middle of the class. What did you put in this? Something like a dead donkey? It must be the blanket. Why, mom? They sell blankets in Istanbul. They don't obviously... why else would you get cold? I put some grape leaves... and Turkish ravioli. And wrapped rice... Nazli, girl... People live like attached to each other? Yes, that's how they reside. Ah, not good. If you go to the window with the wrong cloth, people will see. They will start talking about you. Yes, mom... that's why people sit with their suits on. Now, we switch. Give me that, darling. Nazli, give it to me. - Did you put potatoes in it? - Yes, potatoes... You think we don't have potatoes around here, mom;? That was unnecessary... Ah... run, go get it. - Don't shout. - It's going... - Let it go... - No! I worked for that! Mom! Mom! - Dude! - Mom! Girl, I chased this turnip pickle for a reason. It helps you pump blood. It heats your hands and feet. You will eat. I won't. - No, you will... - Mom I don't like turnip pickle. Alright, okay... Actually, a wood stove would be great over here. Once you fire it up, it will heat the place with strong flames. Put them on... Mom, what are you doing? I don't want to... Put them on... Ah, Nazli... How did they live in this dirt? I felt like I cleaned pus! I made a thorough cleaning. Well, you'll be fine until my next visit. Okay, dear? Yeah, yeah I'll be fine. Nazli... Girl! Are you talking... with someone? You keep writing and writing... Day and night, you keep writing. No, mom... I was texting my friends about lessons. I'll sleep now. About lessons... yep... Nazli? Yes? How is he? Is he handsome? Maybe he is a doctor. Is he a doctor? Mom, I say, it's a friend. Don't give me the third degree! Bah! Friendship is good... getting along well is very important. Then you'll spend a lifetime together. Ah, mom ah! You don't get me! Don't "ah" me! And say goodbye to your phone! Good night! Good night! Nazli, don't go whenever he calls... Just keep it cool... that makes you more valuable. Sometimes take your friends with you when you meet him, okay? Then you'll introduce me first, okay? Yes, this is our book first. - Read it. - Do you want me to read it? Are you ready? Yes... Alright, I'll start now. Why don't you start? I am excited for the evening. I wonder if your parents like my parents... Why wouldn't they, love? I am sure they are very sweet. You don't know my guys. Osman... keep your eye off the road and look at me. Do I look okay for the first encounter with our new relatives? Yes, you do... you look like a new bride. What is this over-care? What do you mean? I am marrying off my one and only daughter. Ah... Groom's father is a big engineer. And the mother is a big... engineer wife... He may be a big engineer! And I am a big truck driver, so what? Yes, that's true. We have been waiting here for an hour. Nazli... Are we going to wait any longer for your parents? They are about to come, Ms. Nihal... I mean... I am invited somewhere else after this. Nihal... we don't know when this gathering will be over... why did you make another plan? I thought this would end early. What do we have to talk for hours? Hey! Man! You can't leave your car here... take it somewhere else. Come on man! We'll grab a bite... it can stay here for a while. - Ah, are you here for dinner? - Yes. Then, I need to take your keys. Why? There is this respected family... and we'll marry our daughter off with their son. That's why we should go now... Ma'am... I am the valet of this restaurant. Ah... okay. I park our customers' cars here. - Ah, why did you bury the lead? - Keys, please. Alright, but this car is my responsibility... and second of all, I don't know you. Why would I give you the key? Alright, okay, okay. We'll give our girl... giving this key is nothing when compared to her. Ah, I hope it doesn't break. Oops... - Mom? - Nazli... oh dear... Oh, my beautiful girl. Praise be... Your dress looks great on you. - How do you do? I am Mert. - Hello... you are so handsome. Thank you. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Allow me to kiss. - Ah, please. How do you do... I am Vahit... Mert's father. Welcome. - My mother, Nihal. - Welcome... Salutations. Let's sit here. Sit... How was your trip? I hope it was good. It was a nice trip... Osman and I chitchatted on the road here. First of all... thank you for honoring our invitation and coming here. It's a pleasure meeting you. - It is our... you know. - Pleasure... Yes, pleasure... So, new relative... what's up, new relative? You spaced out... We are fine... Our son asked for this... and here we are. Well, when our Mert son said he wanted to marry... we really got excited. And we got to know Nazli, this good girl... right Nihal? Well, not "got to know"... but we get to know her, slowly. We'll see. Welcome... what would you like to have? Some soup first, dear. Why the soup? Have some meat or something. To balance my stomach. We are hungry, man... hungry like wolf... after all that trip. Maybe some meat... I want veal entrecote on spinach bed... cook it raw now. Your favorite spinach all over again! Mom! Okay... stop laughing... stop it. Mom! I want... meat... well done... do it on any bed... Alright... we'll order later. Well, now... it is hard to... you know... hard to raise a child. A son or a daughter. You raise them, you feed them, you send them to school... This all means money to spend. You are totally right... yes you are. It needs patience to raise a child nowadays. But... you raised one here. Praise be! Looks like you raised him really well. And you raised Nazli very well, Ms. Ayşe. Clever... sly... cunning... What did she say now? I mean... she persuaded Mert for marriage in such short time... it's an accomplishment. Dad... cut to the chase please. Well, we are here for... for the very well know reason. Poor girl falls for the rich boy... - Mom, that's enough... cut it! - What did I say, son? I just summed it up. Ms. Nihal, please. So, let me sum it up what I see... Your son... he works with his father, right? So, he needs the salary his father pays, right? What's that supposed to mean? How dare you? How dare I? You know what I mean... My daughter is a very good teacher. It's like a golden bracelet for guarantee. One day, let say... if your husband here goes like, "Bah, I won't work with him anymore"... is my daughter going to take care of the family? No, this won't end fine, Osman. Mom, enough. I think you got me all wrong, Ms. Ayşe. I did not get you wrong. You didn't like us. Fine... we didn't like you, either. Mom, enough. Let's see what you'll do about it. Splendid! Neither of us likes the other family. So we can forget about all this. Yeah, let's forget about this. You have been showing off since we got here. I am not going to force you to take my girl, am I? Bah! Enough of this charade! I'm leaving. You are not going anywhere... sit back, mom. If you marry this girl, forget about me. Give me a break! Come on... it is us who should go now. Ms. Ayşe? I don't have a daughter to give you. Nazli... move... come... What the hell was this? Nazli... Nazli, wait... don't go! Mom, kudos to you! Bravo! I'll get the truck. Yeah, do that... let's get out of here right away. What are you doing? Shut up! Don't you dare say a word! You dragged us all the way down here... and we heard all those offending words. Really? Are you not tired of embarrassing me? Ah, come on! Give me a break! Enough! You ruined my life! - Bah, don't be ridiculous! - I hate you! Yes, hate me! Hate me! Am I the one who ruined my life? You always chastise me! Honey... Yes... I am all ears, Ms. Ayşe. Ms. Nihal... I am sorry... I made a mistake. Nazli is terrible... even you would pity her. You are a mother... you can understand. Yes, no mother can live with this... but am I the reason for all this? No... it is my fault. I was being ignorant... I did wrong. Nazli has never been lucky like Mert. She went to school... and she worked at the same time... then she fell in love. And just before she was supposed to get married, I screwed up. She doesn't talk to me anymore... and she won't until you forgive me, I know. Please, don't stop this marriage. This is my daughter's happiness. Nice words but... Marriage is not only between the couple. If the families' levels are not the same, no one can be happy. Don't worry about that part... we'll be off your way. What do you mean? You can say "she is an orphan... she has no parents" I just want my daughter to be happy... I can love her from far away. I don't know how that happened... we got married with a gorgeous ceremony. But my mother never came to my house. I was so happy because I was with the man I love. Darling, you work all day. Why did you cook all this? We could have ordered something. No problem dear, don't even mention. You are still doing something. Please sit... Both school and the baby... how can you deal with them both? After birth, you'll quit, right? No way, Ms. Nihal... you know how I love my job. Look... you haven't seen your parents for a while. We can invite them over. Your mother can help you until your birth. No need for that... we can hire a woman to help. No need for anyone else. Mom? How are you, Nazli dear? I'm fine. Is something wrong? You don't sound well. Nazli dear, you have to come to the village... - Why? - It's your father. Oh God... so shocking. Ah, Osman... Osman, dear. Nazli! Osman... Osman, look your daughter is here. She is an orphan now. When my father died, I felt like a void grew inside me. A void full of things we couldn't do together anymore. But you get used to the absence of somebody... who has never actually been there. Still, I would want him to pat my head once... to be proud of me... and say "that's my daughter" I hope he could be generous about showing his love the way... he used to show his anger. Thank you. Is there enough rice for everyone? Everyone should eat. No, thank you. Won't you eat? No, no... eat. Let's put it here... you can grab a bite. - Nazli, dear... are you alright? - I am, thank you. Nazli, dear... you can rest for a while inside. Meryem, can you pick her luggage from the car? - Of course... - No, Meryem... no, just sit. Mom, I won't stay... I'll go back. Don't... what do you mean? You should stay for your father's seventh day memorial... and prayers ceremony. Just think about it... don't decide so fast. Nazli dear... you haven't eaten anything since you got here... eat some. Come on... Meryem... I can't eat... it makes me nauseous. Nauseous? Girl, what are you saying? Are you pregnant? Ah... see that? She has been hiding it under her hat. Ah, Nazli dear! Oh... I'm glad to hear that. Nazli... darling. Good news, Ayşe. Good God... He takes a life and gives one. May God bless you with a painless birth! Amin, God willing. Osman's death you know... that got me preoccupied. I was going to give you the good news... but I couldn't... I am sorry. Thank you for coming here. If you need anything, please call us. I'll be in the car. Call me once you get there, okay Nazli? This has been a difficult pregnancy. I have doctor appointment tomorrow, that's why I can't stay. Alright, take good care of yourself. Nazli... Why did I learn about it with everyone else? Why didn't you tell me? Mom, we have just learned... I couldn't find time... Ah, otherwise you would have told me, right? You'd go like, "good news, you'll be a grandma", right Nazli? I would. Mom... what will you do here all alone? My father is gone... My home is here, honey. My friends... my animals... my mother's grave... Your cherry tree is here. You may want to come back here some day... Come back here? Nazli, you'll never know. We should all have a home to come back. I've never had one... you should have one. - Don't get cold. Get inside. - I won't until you leave. But you are coughing. I can go after you leave. Mom, it's the funeral house... you may need it. Girl, this is not okay. No, please keep it. Okay, thank you. Get inside now. Mom was entrusted to me... it hit me when my father was gone... but I was running away from her and my responsibilities. But that wasn't going to last so long... because I was going to be a mother. The eyebrows, the eyes... God, bless this baby with good luck. Amin. We have become grannies, Ms. Nihal. We prefer the word "grandmother". Grandmother... Grand grand mother... you are the "grandest" mother! Where is the baby? My lion... look at him... so cute. Isn't he too small? Small? You were as small as him when you were born. Look, he smiles. When can I take him into my arms? Love, doctor say he needs to rest, you know. He needs to get a little bit better. Once he rests, you can take him into your arms as long as you want. Right, mom? Of course, dear... of course. He is moving a lot... Love, come... you are exhausted. You need to rest, too. I don't want to leave him... So, do you get how it feels now? I used to snuggle to you, and you used to run away. So, that's the way it goes, right? That's right. Oh dear... go get some rest. Come on... Mom, you'll be here, right? Ms. Ayşe... you saw Nazli and the baby. We'll have visitors coming tonight. You'll probably go back, right? I won't... That was last year's deal. Look, I made post-birth sherbet for the baby. Sherbet? It's all made of sugar... It's tradition. And be careful, don't drink too much. This would bring even your milk back. Come on... come dear. Love? Love... Love... Love... Love... calm down. Calm down... Love, I'll be back now, okay? - I'll be outside. - Okay, mom. I'll be back, mom. Nazli, don't cry. Darling, don't be sad... You are young... you'll have kids. Look at me... God took my two babies but He gave you to me. He gave you to me, darling. Don't be sad... please. Enough! You can't protect me from everything. I couldn't take my baby into my arms. He died before I took him into my arms. Nazli... I couldn't. Nazli, don't cry. Not even once... Is he dead? After that day, I didn't see my mother for a long time. Actually, I was ignoring anything around. It takes time to accept the pain... and to dress the wounds, one goes back to her shell again. Mom... I came... I came... Oh, dear. Are you alright? Are you? I am great... I am great, Nazli. Oh dear... Give me that... Mom, I can carry that. No, no... I'll take it. You came... You came back... you came back... Girl, you did the best. Come, come in. It's done. Mom, you didn't have to bother... I won't stay here. What's that supposed to mean, Nazli? Are you here to ask for a lighter then go back or what? No, I won't let you go. Nay... I'll sleep in my mother's arms. In her room. Fine... that bed is big... big enough for us both. Alright then. Nazli? I have something to ask... What? Are things shaking between you and your husband? - No, mom... - Not that. Your mother-in-law didn't press a button, right? No, mom... no one said anything. Come on, you are about to ask "why are you here?" Maybe I missed my mom. Maybe? Really? Mother should be missed... Alright... I'll set the table... don't do anything, okay? Okay. Tomorrow, you and I have some mother daughter time around. Fine... Mom? What? What did my father do to his hair for that dinner in Istanbul? Girl, how did you remember that, now? Nazli... Girl... like a piece of coal, he went to the bathroom and dyed his hair to black. You should have seen that... it was like roasted eggplants... I was afraid to tell him that. Mom, why didn't dad ever love us? Of he loved you... who can "not" love you? He loved you but... in his way... Once you were born, he got super excited. He served baklava to everyone in the village. Before you, people were like... "that woman can't have a baby... she may deliver a stone but not definitely a baby" He got offended... Then when you were born... he said "this girl has been really coy, she kept us waiting... that's why we should call her Nazli"... which means "coy" I wish he could have shown me his love... anyway... Well, after all, a man called "Osman" lived and passed. Nazli? Yep? Mom, why did you come alone? Why didn't bring your husband with you? Mom, Mert and I are not stuck to each other. We don't have to go everywhere together. Yes, you'll go everywhere together! You are a husband and a wife. Bah, I'll sleep now. I got tired on the road. Don't "bah" me! I didn't "bah" you. Ah... come on... are you cold? Your hands are frozen... alright then, good night. Always a different kind of red! For God's sake, do this right for once! - Good day. - Thank you, sis... how may I... Nazli dear! Oh God... welcome, my rose. Girl... girl, when did you come? - Yesterday. - Yesterday? Ah! Aunt Ayşe always says you'll take her to Antalya. Is that why you are here? Ah, she must be thrilled. Come on, get inside. Tea, coffee? What would you like to have? No, Meryem... I don't want anything. It's sunny outside. Come, let's have some fresh air. Alright, dear. Alright. We can go to our spot? Sure. Okay. Come, dear. Atta girl! I missed you a lot, girl. I wanted to come to Istanbul many times... there was always something to stop me. Then I said to myself, "Nazli would come here eventually" and here you are. Girl, did you come here alone? Meryem, don't get started like my mother. Of course I will... I am your friend. Nazli? Are you happy? Where did that come from? Of course I am. Are you happy? I don't know... I think I am. Girl... I told you in high school that I was going to marry Cemal... I married him. Then my daughter Zeynep was born. Aunt Ayşe told me... I really got sad for your baby. But don't let that bum you out. Girl, do you remember Emine the Famine? She lost three babies and delivered the forth baby. Don't be sad... you'll have a baby again. We'll see. Meryem? Yep? Did you ever regret staying here? No girl... why would I regret that? Why do we all choose places to stay? Because those places make us happy. The reason that made me stay made you leave. Right... I left. Girl! Zeynep! Come here... you'll get your feet cold. Girl, I say "come here" - Meryem? - Yes? I entrust my mother to you. Why did you say that? Your mother is my mother... She is no different from my mother. Of course she is. Thank you... I'm glad I have you. Girl, tell me the truth... Is there something you don't tell me? Is Aunt Ayşe alright? No, no... she is fine. And we should go now. I promised mom... Thank God. Alright, you say she is fine... We can go now. Zeynep, come here, girl! Please, don't make me sad. I really want to get you that. No, girl... no. But look... it has this furry collar... you like that. For God's sake... this was unnecessary. This looks good. Take a look at the mirror and see if you'll like it. Mom, let's have our photo taken. Side by side? Okay, fine. Come on. Not without your lipstick. What? Take this off. - No... my daughter got it for me. - We are ready. Nazli... the food at home wasn't enough... That's why you got me here, right? Darling, I am lazy about cooking for myself... but I could cook for you, Nazli. This all costs too much unnecessarily. Ayşe Sultan... you raised me and sent me to school... won't you let that pay off? - I will... - Of course you will. I'll have wrapped rice. It looks good. Go ahead, you should eat, too. Mom... Mom? Yes, dear? Don't hide them anymore. There is no one else to play with them. Darling... Darling... My beautiful daughter. Since you came, you have been making me feel good... but you can't do that for yourself. You have been burying your problem inside... do you think I don't get that? Nazli... Nazli, please, my beautiful girl... Please don't be sad. Don't be sad... you are young. You are young... you will have a lot of kids! I will, right? I will... They will run in the garden... chase the chicken. You'll chase them to feed, right? Of course I will, girl. I'll be exhausted by chasing them with a spoon in my hand... "here comes the plane" Come on, pull yourself together. I can make you some warm milk... it will make you feel better. Okay. And this one is going nowhere, little lady. My grandchild will play with it next year... Alright then... Today, my Nazli went to Istanbul. She'll be teacher... I miss her a lot already. I went to see Nazli's mother-in-law for her. I begged her... I said, "we should get our kids married" One should never bend her head down... if it's not for her child. Mom... My daughter buried her baby today... God, don't test us with anything worse. Mom... Nazli? Nazli, girl... it's your phone. Na... Hello, Nazli. Ah, Mert... son... it's me, your mother-in-law. Mom, you? Mert, sorry... I answered this one but... Nazli is sleeping... I didn't want to wake her up. Is she alright? Well, you know... she is sad like you... She doesn't eat much. She'll get better. I told her that, too. I was like, "you are both too young, you'll have kids again... don't feel sad about that." Alright, son? Just have some patience. Mert? What happened? Mert, hello. Mom. Mert? Nazli is dying, mom. Mert? She is dying. Pancreas cancer... it's the last stage. Mom... I'm begging you. Don't let her understand that you know. She didn't want to tell anyone. She didn't want to make you sad. I can't do anything, mom. She came to say you goodbye. Mom? Mom... guess what I saw in my dream. Mom... Yes, dear? Come on... don't you listen? What did you see? We were both in Antalya... it was warm outside. You and I sat by the sea. Antalya... that's good. How do we go to Antalya? By plane... it's very near. We can jump on the plane and hello Antalya! Just like that. Alright then... You don't leave your mom... you go with me. Come on... Antalya plane... departing. Mom, I better not eat... Clean air made me dizzy, I suppose... It's my stomach... I should get some rest. It makes people dizzy... Get some rest. But you should eat, okay? Good night. Oh baby... she got cold. My daughter got cold. Mom? Darling, are you cold? I got you milk... it's for good health. Mom, what's going on? You'll get better, dear. Drink it. You'll get better, girl. Drink. Good girl. I'm here. Are you okay? Baby, I'm with you... I'm okay. And you'll be fine... you'll get better. You won't die, dear! Mom, I'm terrified. I'm terrified. No... don't be... oh dear, don't be. I am sorry. I am sorry... so sorry. So sorry that I made you sad. So sorry, I couldn't be there for you. Mom, I said you embarrassed me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How can I leave you? How can I? You won't... you won't! Come with me! Move! We'll pack your luggage... pack up! You are going to Istanbul. Mom, I won't. - You will! - I won't! - You will! - Mom, I won't... I'm begging you. I won't, mom... I won't! - You will... - I won't. I couldn't take good care of you! I couldn't... it's my fault... it's my fault. You'll go to Istanbul. You'll be healed in Istanbul. You'll be healed and come back again. Mom, don't... Mom, I won't... I must stay here. I won't forgive you. I won't forgive you. Promise me! Promise that you'll come back. Say it! Say it, or I won't forgive you! Promise me! Promise me that you'll come back! I'm begging you! Promise me! Promise me! I couldn't take good care of you! Promise me! I do! I promise! I promise! It's okay, I promise you! I promise you! Mom! Nazli... Mom! Nazli! Mom! Honey! Mom! Mom, don't do that... mom! Nazli! Mom, please... please... Mom! Mom, don't leave me! Mom, please! Mom! Nazli! Mom, don't leave me! Nazli! - Nazli! - Mom, don't leave me! Nazli! Mom! Nazli! Mom! Mom, I'm dying... I'm dying. Mom, I'm dying...
