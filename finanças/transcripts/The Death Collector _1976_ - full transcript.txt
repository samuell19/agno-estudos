[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [Jerry] But I gotta go. - 'It is 3 o'clock in the mor--' - 'Oh, don't go.' [Jerry] 'Look I gotta go. Give me a break, will you?' Oh, Jerry. Come on, it's 3 o'clock in the morning. - Three o'clock in the morning? - That's what I said. - Waiting in bed for you. - Yeah, I know, where is it? Oh, Christ. Oh, my God. The bar closes at two and Frank's gonna come home. Frank's gonna come home. Frank? Who's Frank? Frank who? What's his last name? - Benino. - Frank Benino? - Yeah, Frank Benino. - You mean, Jessie James? Yeah. 'Yeah, I, I know your old man.' Didn't know Jessie James was your husband. You didn't tell me that. [chuckles] Oh, God. What's the matter, you scared he's gonna come up here? Let me tell you, he walks up here "Hey, Jessie, how are you? Hey, how you doing?" Boom, I hit him on the left, then I smack him around a few times. Then I poke him right in the eyes and kick him down the stairs. Now, what's he gonna do with me? 'Huh?' He's a fat slob, your husband. 'Tell you what I'll do with him.' [scoffs] Forget about him. Smack him right in his fuckin' head. [instrumental music] - Sally? - Oh, Christ. He's here. Just go. - What's wrong with you? - Just take your things-- What are you, crazy? Hey! It's a good jacket, throwin' it around like that. Get out of here, please, go. Hey, where you going? Frank Benino, huh? [music continues] Jesus fuck Christ, am I glad to see you, Mr. Benino. 'I had a call down to the joint.' 'They told me to come over as quick as I could.' 'Couple of guys were admirin' your wife.' Hey, how do I know? Mrs. Benino, it's alright. Frank is here, he's got everything under control. Frank, you got everything under control? - Yeah. - You sure? 'Listen, I gotta go out' 'there are a few people waiting in the place' over there like that, alright? - Yeah. - Alright. [Jerry] Okay, I'll see you later, Frank. Hey, Sally! 'Sally, get your ass down here.' 'Open the goddamn door.' [Sally sobbing] [Frank] 'Who? That guy who lived here?' [instrumental music] [male #1] 'Hey, Jerry, hi.' Now if you were a little younger I would like to bag you myself. Yeah, you can bag at other sources. [male #2] 'Where you been, I've been trying to get ya' a couple of times. Thanks, Chick. - Here. - Thanks, Chick. - Salud. - Salud. So what can I do for you? I thought, I'd just stop by and let you know I'm available now. Hey, there are a lot of guys around. I got a list that reads like welfare. Yeah, but we both know that I'm not like a lot of the guys. So, what do you wanna do? I figured maybe a few collections. Collections,hey, something nice and easy 'so you don't have to dirty your hands.' You want to die in a state of grace, right? What are you, in a hole? Well, I mean, things could be better. What do you want with collection? You're not a collector. You wanna know why you never make out? 'Cause you're all over the place. Toady you gotta be a specialist. You, you got a great head for engineering scores but you never listened to me. I could be a collector. But it's not my business. I'm an agent. 'Anybody wants town they come to me' 'because they know I'm gonna be here.' 'I don't fence and I don't shark.' 'And I never put my ass out on a street, never.' I know that. I mean, that's one of the reasons I came down. I figured I'd get put back on your talent list and, uh if something comes up you give me a call. Why? Why should I? I get you a job. I put money in your pocket. And you disappear for another two years. Look I get a job right? Then I retire. - You get in a hole? - Then I get in a hole. Then I go back to work again. What do I gotta do, punch a clock with you? What about my feelings, they don't count? Look, I don't want to push the point about the job and everything 'cause you're busy with your macaroni. But if something comes up, you give me a call. Like that. Let me ask you something. You still with that girl, Paula? What's the matter, you don't like her? What are you talking.. I love that girl. Are you crazy, here? Take this home. Tell her to cook it. You know what that is? Yes, the noodles from Basta Lundi. 'That's right. That's very good.' Now I'm gonna ask you something else and be very truthful and don't lie. When are you gonna marry that girl? What? I said, when are you gonna marry that girl? I can't hear you. I said, when you gonna marry that girl? Oh, you wanna know when I'm gonna marry that girl? Chickie, straighten him out, will ya? Look, you don't have to get married nowadays. Turns out bad when you get married. Now, you're living in a state of sin. Really? I thought I was living in the state of New Jersey. I'm gonna go. Give me a call if you need me. Get outta here. I like him. [instrumental music] [music continues] [Paula] You know what? It reminds me of the one my father used to have. [Jerry] And it's only $18,000. - How much? - $18,000. [Jerry] To sleep in a car. [Paula] And before my father bought our camper I used to think that grass grew out of concrete. [Jerry] Grass does grow out of concrete. You ever saw when you were a kid, you walked down the street like a crew cut in-between the two blocks of cement. [Paula] Oh, stop it. [Jerry] Look, don't worry. I got somebody working here for us. Just give me a couple of days and I am with you.. and you'll see what I mean. - In that bed? - Who needs a bed? [Jerry] 'Look, Paula, no pulling that tenacious stuff, do you?' [instrumental music] [whirring] Hey, Gussie, how are you? - Hey, Jerry, what up? - How you been, alright? 'I'm a big time guy now. You know what I'm sayin'.' - 'I've been busy.' - Feel alright? I feel good, how about yourself? - Good. - You gotta buy yourself a belt. What are you doing, using it as a rope or a belt? Hey, Gus, I got one of my new pieces here, yeah? My Lord, you don't have to shoot that thing. You could use it for a baseball bat. You don't mind if I take it in the back. I wanna fire it a few times. 'Gussy, you look just like Santa Claus.' 'You got the white hair like that' 'and the big red cheeks.' You're a crazy old man. I'll be back in a bit, alright? [gunshots] [birds chirping] [metal creaking] [whirring] [gunshots continue] JB, monogrammed bullets. Just like my shirt. Let me ask you something, when you get one of those campers who's the first guy you call? You. You know I got you in mind. [indistinct chattering] Fine, how are you? Okay, come on, eight. Come on, eight. Sir, give me five. [chattering continues] See you later. Baba! Hey, he's gone. Ten. Point is ten. [Jerry] 'Alright, all the boxes.' [male #3] 'Come on now, make your bets.' [chattering continues] Nine. Point is ten. Move your hands close please. 'Coming out, shooter.' Seven out, line away. New shooter. [chattering continues] Thanks. Anthony wants to see you. Show me his things. Jerry. Sit down. Sit. Sit right in the chair. 'The other day, you tell me you're in a hole.' And I just seen you go for another 500. What do you think's gonna happen when they find out you can't pay the money you owe 'em? I figured I send you a letter like Master Charge. [Anthony] 'Hey, now, they don't send no letters.' 'They send old Val with Johnny Fingers.' I've been thinking about ya. I don't like what I'm gonna do because I have a lot of men with families who need the work. 'I'm gonna throw a little something to you' 'because I'm a nice man and I remember.' You forget. But I remember. 'I wanna see you tomorrow.' Alright. Master Charge. [Jerry] 'Baba, you go over to the table use your tip yet.' [Baba] Yeah, to give it a shot.' [Jerry] Forget about it. Probably lose anyway. Big time, what is it? Hey, Joe Ubats. I was watching you gamble over there. You don't stick it in like you used to, pal. Yeah, I lost a few dollars. 'Uh, you lost more than a few, I was watching.' How's your, uh, short stuff friend Butchy doing? Come on, relax, Butchy. Calm down. What about you? You coming with me? Yeah, I'm coming with you, motherfucker. You hear about, Butchy, huh? [grunting] I don't think we'll be seein' him anymore. He was foolin' around with them New York guys. [engine revving] Nobody's seen him a long time. [machines whirring] That's too bad. - Hey, Serge, how are you? - Jerry, how are you? Good to see you. Can you lend me a couple of bucks? I just gave you a couple of bucks. Give the guy a couple of bucks, will you? I can't move nobody. You moved me pretty good, don't you? What you doin' with all this money? I'm losing it. Why don't you at least buy yourself a new pair of sneakers or something? Six.. And that's eight all together, right? Jerry, I'll see you around and about. Look at this. I got $100 for my kick for the month. Listen, I got a score for you. 'Oh, yeah?' Something I think you'll like. Pretty easy, you know? 'It's a supermarket.' I think it's perfect for us. I mean, if you're interested. I know you like to work alone. Forget about scores. Book a few horses. Bet Monday night football. But forget about scores. We'll end up in a can. We need money.. ...to book horses...book games. I'm broke, I don't have any money. If every son of a bitch around here that owes me money paid me.. ...maybe I could do somethin'. Like that jerk over there, Buddy Scalese 'he owes me 400 for three months.' - 'This kid over here?' - 'Yeah.' - The tan suit? - 'Yeah, that's it.' - Why don't you collect? - 'You hear what I said.' 'Buddy Scalese, Jimmy Scalese's nephew.' - So what? - What do you mean, so what? You know who Jimmy Scalese is. Lemme understand this. Because his uncle's Al Capone.. ...that mean he don't have to pay? What do you think? Why don't you introduce me to this kid? 'For what?' Well, because I'd like to meet him. - You wanna abuse him? - 'I don't want to.' 'I just wanna meet the kid.' I mean if his uncle's such a big time racket guy I'm impressed by stuff like that. Are you in some trouble? No, I just wanna meet the kid. You mean, just fool around? Yeah, just like, you know break horns with him. - I'll introduce you. - Alright. There's two kinds of people in this world. There's the sheep and the shepherds. And there's wolves too. Hey. Buddy, how you doin'? Listen.. Just say hello to a friend of mine Jerry Bolanti. How's it goin'? Shit! My horse got boxed today. I dropped 500. Five hundred? Excuse me, uh, Mr. Scalese? May I ask you a question? How can you bet $500 on a horse race? When you owe my friend here 400. Hey, who is this guy? I thought he was your friend. He doesn't mean anything. Joe, wait a second. Excuse me, uh, your name is Buddy Scalese, right? Is there any chance you're related to Jimmy Scalese? - Yeah. - 'I thought so.' There's a very strong resemblance in the eyes. I'm his nephew. You're Jimmy Scalese's nephew? Phew. I heard a lot about your uncle. He's a big time guy. That's right. Let me ask you just one more question. How come such an important man like Jimmy Scalese.. ...has such a faggot, limb dick, motherfuckin' welcher like you for a fuckin' nephew, eh? I don't care how many uncles you got. That doesn't make you any better than anybody else. [indistinct shouting] Now, you gonna pay my friend the money or I'm gonna bite your fuckin' heart out. Bastard! You crazy bastard! Take a fuckin' hike. Got it? Take a hike! I'm not gonna forget this. You're gonna pay for this! Hey, college boy, go walk your poodle before I really get mad and bite your nose off. 'Go ahead, take a walk I said!' [indistinct chattering] Let me go. Let me go. [panting] Nice kid, eh? Listens pretty good. I don't believe you. You know what you did, huh? What? You started a lot of trouble. What are you talkin' about? I handled that as smooth as silk. I got a call from Tanky last night he told me what happened. Two hours I had to sit down with Scalese. What the hell's the matter with you? You know better than that. 'What are you messin' with those people for?' You know, they'd kill you for what you did. Twenty five years, I've been in this neighborhood with Scalese and Rizzo before and never once did I have to sit down to apologize for myself running and my people. Look, Anthony, I'm sorry you had to do that. You gotta know this. That kid don't pull any special privileges with me. He's Scalese's nephew and you don't abuse a Scalese. You don't abuse his nephew, his niece, his cousin or his fuckin' barber. You understand what I'm sayin'? I leave them alone, they leave me alone. And you just went and fuck it all up! 'Tell Scalese to pay the money the kid owes.' and, uh... we'll forget the whole thing. But we're gonna do it my way. I told Jimmy that you will go down and apologize to him personally. Then we all start friends again. I wish you wouldn't have done that. I don't even know why I try to protect you. You're not protecting me. You're protecting yourself and you're protecting them. Oh. What am I from Butte, Montana? 'You think I just parachuted into this neighborhood?' Come on...I know what's goin' on. Everybody thinks like you. And these guys, they do whatever they want. They welch on debts. 'And what do you do?' You kiss the back of their hands and apologize for shittin' with your pants down. I don't care about Scalese. His people, his nephew or his fuckin' barber. And how about that friend of yours you were doin' a favor for, Joey? You think he's not in trouble, eh? Oh, you can take care of yourself 'but he's gonna wind up in a satin box' because he's got friends like you. Youdon't wanna make a Vietnam out of this fuckin' neighborhood! Alright, I'll tell you what. Maybe you don't have to go down there. Maybe I get him on the phone. What do you say? Alright, call him. Call him. Yeah, alright, call him. 'Hello, this Anthony Iadavia. Let me talk to Scalese, please?' Jimmy, how are you? Yeah. That Jerry Bolanti. He wants to talk to you. Yeah, but wait, lemme put him on the phone. Alright, hold for a minute. Talk nice to the man, huh? Worry not. Hello, Mr. Scalese. How are you? Mm-hmm. 'Sir, I want you to know that I didn't mean anything personal' towards you, Mr. Scalese. I apologize if I caused you any embarrassment at all. 'Right. I understand.' But, uh...Mr. Scalese now that I got you on the phone, uh.. ...lemme ask you a question. Mr. Scalese.. Nothin', nothin'. But, uh, what do you think about your nephew? He's laughin' his ass off, Anthony. Even he knows the kid's a jerkoff. [Anthony] Leave it alone. Right, Mr. Scalese. Okay. Here's Anthony. Yeah, Jerry. Yeah. Yeah, well. listen.. We were young ourselves, right. We did the same thing, no? Yeah, right. Yeah, well, listen, Jim. Tell you what. Thank you very much. Why don't I see you in about an hour? And don't worry about the other thing. 'I got somebody takin' care of that.' And Jimmy.. [speaking in Italian] I don't understand. You gonna get us killed, you know that?

'Now, uh, I got somethin' lined up.' How much? I'm not sure, 50,000 maybe. Now, like I said. I need somebody to take Butchy's place. 'What do you think?' I got a guy in mind but I don't think he'll work with you. But I know he's tired right now. Let me see what I could do. Listen, you're not talkin' about Bolanti, are you? Why? Hey, Joey, look at this fag. You could hide him with one hand. I don't know about, Bolanti. I mean I like Jerry, but he's got a half an attitude. You're the one with the attitude. 'What do you think, he's gonna jump at a score?' 'Split three ways with two partners' that don't know a their ass from a hole in a ground? If he does this, he won't do it for the money. And he won't do it for you. He'll do it as a favor to me. Look, I didn't mean anything. What does he gonna do? Sergio? He's on the wheel. I worry about him. It's just because you don't know him. And everybody thinks that this kid goes for coffee and cigarettes, that he's adult. Nobody knows he did 18 months in a camp for me. When the New York's guys came out here lookin' for Butchy. He took some spot and a beatin'. 'Cause he wouldn't tell them anything. 'He's only gonna drive the car.' 'How could he screw that up?' Don't worry about him. Just because you want him, that don't mean I gotta pay for it. I still worry about him. - Call me later. - Okay. Thanks a lot, Anthony. Sergio, come on, let's go. Throw that book away. I paid a buck and a quarter for this. Here, 200. Thank you. Now, look.. Here, here. I'd like you to take care of that, alright. Herb Greene? Yeah, it's Greene. It's Feldshuh, Greene. Scott Feldshuh. Owes Greene about, uh...27,000 that two Jewish businessman, you know? Now, Feldshuh's given Greene a little grief. I want you to take care of it, and when you're finished with that.. Come back, I got somethin' else for you. What you got, another collection? Mm-mm...a supermarket. You know, the joke about another guy. Uh. What's the matter, I'm not doing good enough with the collections? No, it's not that, it's just that I don't know how many more collections I can throw to you. - Anthony, fo-- - Don't "Anthony" me, please! Come on. Put a little coin in your pocket all of a sudden you're gettin' choosy. I want collections. I want collections. What the hell do you think I am? Household finance? If you wanna work, you work. 'If you wanna get choosy, you go someplace else.' Just stop screwin' me around! Jerry...these kids have got a nice score. And if I don't send somebody with them they're gonna blow it. You're the only one I trust. If you do this, you'll be doing me a big favor. Okay. I'll do you the favor. But I engineered the score. Everything's done my way. Now, Anthony.. ...you do me a favor. Don't yell at me anymore.. ...please. We can have some privacy in here. Have a seat. Here-here's some copies of the notes. I made two each. 'You have the addresses?' The gist is I didn't know the relatives. Can you find out for me? I'd, uh, rather... you just deal with him. Now is there, uh, anything else you need? And you're sure this guy's got the money right? Yeah, he's got it. See Bernie's the wise guy. 'He just put his company in Chapter 11.' 'My lawyer's been tryin' to get him into court for months now' but all he talks about is settlement. He, uh, wants to give me $25 a week. Twenty five dollars a week? Bernie's a real comedian. Yeah, exactly. I'm not gonna settle for $25 a week. That's an insult. Let me see if I, uh understand the arrangement. If you collect the money 'I give Mr. Iadavia one third.' Cash. Now just for argument's sake.. ...let's say you don't collect. Forget argument's sake, will you, mister. I'll collect. No, man, well, you know go for a drink. Out for cocktails. Well, we'll go.. 'Well, what's the difference?' Bernie, there's a Mr. Knight here from National Midland Bank. Hold on. National Midland Bank? - Send him in. - Okay. Yeah, let me call you back. Nah, I got some business. I'll call you later. Hello, Mr. Knight. It's a pleasure. Why don't you sit down. Make yourself comfortable. 'Listen I have to apologize, my account is essential.' 'I'm not really sure what National Midland's looking for.' I'm from Herb Greene's office. What the hell is this? Mr. Feldshuh. I'm here to discuss a series of promissory notes. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about. You better get your ass out of here before I call a cop. Now, these notes date back a year and a half. Look I said get your ass out of here before I call a cop. You haven't made a payment since October. What are you, a strong-arm? You gonna beat me up? Now I have some copies of notes here, sir. Answer me, are you gonna beat me up? No, sir. Are you from a collection agency? No, I'm a collector. - What do you have, a gun? - No, sir. Well, I show you how I handle punks like you. 'Herb's got a lot of goddamn nerve.' 'Wait till I get a hold of him.' Now, wait a minute. I'm sorry, but I lied about the gun. I came here as a gentleman to talk business. 'If you just-just please.' Think we can talk sensibly now? Am I gonna have to listen to more of your bullshit, mister? Look.. I told Herb I couldn't meet the notes by October. But he didn't wanna listen to me. I don't wanna listen to you, Mr. Feldshuh. And you still owe me $27,650 with the interest. When does Mr. Greene collect? I haven't got it. Let me explain something to you, Mr. Feldshuh. Alright, look, don't give me a story, huh. Shut up! You owe that money to me now. And I don't care where you get it from. Alright. 'I'll try and get him a $1000.' Thousand dollars? That's an insult. It doesn't even cover the interest. 'I can't do any better than that.' You're gonna have to. Because if you don't... I won't like it. You don't have to threaten me. I'm not threatening you. I just said that I wouldn't like it. [intense music] No! You want your money collected? I don't want violence. If he doesn't pay, he doesn't pay. I don't want you breakin' his arms or shootin' him, or whatever you people do. I do what I'm hired to do. You weren't hired to pull a gun! I was hired to collect money for you, Mr. Greene. I don't care! I thought you might be able to frighten him into payin'. I never said violence. You walk in and pull a gun on him! I could go to jail! You didn't do your job right! Now if he doesn't pay, that's it! Give me back the notes! Go tell it to a tombstone. I'll speak to Mr. Iadavia about this! You can speak to whoever you want. [instrumental music] [car door closes] [music continues] [engine turns over] [music continues] Is it all there? Yeah, it's all here. [Bernie] 'Let's have the notes.' Alright, get Herb on the phone. Mr. Greene. Yeah, it's Mr. Night. I'm here now. No problem. 'Yeah, I told you.' Mr. Feldshuh wants to talk to you. Herb, yeah. You say he's got it? Alright. Good. 'I understand.' 'I understand you didn't give a shit' 'what I had to go through, Herb!' Yeah. He's got the money, Herb. Goodbye. You know, I didn't have to give it all to you right away. Oh, I know. You should thank me. I made your job easy for you. Goddamn creep. [eerie music] [music continues] [gunshots] [tires screeching] [instrumental music] [honking] [music continues] Jerry? Oh, my God! Jesus, what happened to you? What happened? [music continues] This one here looks... close to the spot. They didn't miss too many spots did they? Got a little something to lean on till he's better, that's all. When he wakes up... I want you to give him these. Here, alright? 'And I don't want him to do anything stupid' 'you understand?' 'Okay.' I'll take care of this. Come on, come on, it's alright. Alright. [instrumental music] [sobbing] Come on, come on, it'll be alright. [thuds] What are you doing up? Trying to go to the bathroom. I've got the pan for you. What's the matter with you? Pan? You take the pan, and the pills and everything-- And what? And what? You know what. [panting] Not that way, the other way. Help me with the other leg, please. Didn't even put your slippers on. You know you're actin' like a baby? All I need is a rattle.. ...and a crib, and I'll feel like a baby! 'Gimme a match.' 'I'm gonna be sick.' Why did somebody shoot you? Why don't you ask them? Well, if you told me, maybe at least I'd sleep better. Your back is all bloody. I don't know what's going on. Sometimes, I hate you for it. [thunder rumbling] [instrumental music] [music continues] [rumbling continues] No. [mumbles] Wait, no! [indistinct groaning] No, please. 'Please.' 'Please. Please..' [groaning] [yelling] You owe owe me money, mister. I want it! - Now, open your eyes. - Please. Can you hear me? [coughing] [choking] No.. [coughing] Bernie, I can sympathize with your situation. But my boys did what they were supposed to do! You got your money back. You got what you paid for! Bullshit. I paid you good money and you send me a couple amateurs from Bloomfield Avenue. Bernie, I can't get no mechanic for 10,o00! Not for two hits! Stop it, will you, please? You get twenty different guys for that kind of money! This is not Orchard Street, Bernie. I'm not shoppin' around for a suit of clothes! Spinoza. I've given you a lotta goddamn business. 'You got a very short memory.' [laughing] Okay.. Alright. You're a bigger thief than me. But I'm telling you now, Bernie.. ...you owe me on this one. 'And don't worry about it.' 'Greene and Bolanti will be taken care of.' Mr. Clement? - You call me Sam. - Alright. I'm Mr. Greene's secretary. He's ready for you now. Fine. Have you been doing business with him long? Not for the last two to three years. Oh, I see. Are all the secretaries as pretty as you? - I'm the finest one he's got. - I can dig it. [chuckles] - Pretty girl, I love your hair. - Why, thank you. I try not to go anywhere without it. 'Mr. Greene?' Mr. Ply-- [screams] [groans] [instrumental music] [indistinct chattering] [Anthony] Who do you think had him killed? It was Feldshuh. You go back, you break his legs, what do you think he's gonna do sit down his ass? I don't understand you, why do you leave yourself so wide open like this don't you know it's cheaper to kill you than to bail you? Don't worry. I take good care of myself. 'May be you should just walk away for a while and go work' on that supermarket. I want you to stay away from Feldshuh. I'll take care of this. [groans] You want some help? What the hell you got in your pocket? Grenades? It's my piece. - 'You keep in your pocket?' - Yeah. Why don't you get a little class? Buy a holster like everybody else? [door closes] [door knocks] [intense music] [footsteps approaching] [gunshots] [music continues] [clicking] [yelling] [Joe] 'That's the bag, you see?' 'Once he gets that he's out in a minute.' - 'Nobody else watching?' - 'Look for yourself.' [Joe] 'This is easy, I'm telling you.' [Jerry] 'That's his car, right? The black one.' - 'Yeah.' - Good.

[indistinct] [Joe] 'I told you, he doesn't have a piece.' [Jerry] 'Doesn't look like he's carrying one.' [music continues] In fact he kinda looks like a weasel too. [Joe] Looking pretty good, Jerry. This guy wouldn't have to carry a piece. [Joe] You think we could do it? [Jerry] I don't know. What do you think, Joe? [Joe] I don't know, Jerry. What do you think? You think we can do it?

Yes, thank you. What's this? - It's my piece. - Your piece? It's got a holster too. I had it adjusted. 'It is beautiful.' - 'Really nice.' - Thank you. 'Got any landmines?' I could probably get some. Good, we might have to blow up a block or something. We're not going to commit mass murder, you know that, don't ya? I'm not gonna commit mass murder. This thing goes through six people. - Put this away. - It's not loaded. I don't care. I don't want to see it, ever. 'Get rid of it!' [piano music] The songs of Steven Foster.. ...have been lost in the sands of time. This guy kidding? Right now, I'd like to bring back one of those songs if I may.

[yelling] [music continues] [grunting] [engine revving] [grunting continues] [music continues] - He killed him. - He wouldn't give me the bag. I told you nobody's gotta get hurt on this job. He won't give me the damn bag. - You're an amateur. - Don't call me that. I said you're an amateur! [Joe] 'Don't call me that, I'm warning you.' 'On top of that we left him sitting up in the car!' [Serge] 'You left him sitting up, Joe?' [Joe] 'Shut up!' [Joe] 'What time you people get outta here tonight?' [Jerry] 'What's the matter, you miss your girl?' [Joe] 'No, I miss your girl.'

[Joe] 'We'll meet you down there.' - Alright, Serge, I'll see you. - See you in a little while. Don't let him play with the money too long. Hey, Joey.. ...we got 40,000 right? I get one third, huh? - Right, one third. - So, what is the.. How much do I get? One third, plus Anthony's 10 percent. Oh, yeah, 10 percent from Anthony. So that's.. Uh, the 10 percent.. Does that come off the 40 the 40,000 or, or do we split the 40,000 then he takes the 10 percent? Of, like, w-of my one third? Maybe we oughta get H&R Block to figure it out for you. We don't have to pay tax on this. I know we don't have to pay tax. Now, we're alone, I wanna talk to you anyway. - What's the matter? - Doesn't matter. I just wanna talk to you, we didn't talk in a long time. We've been friends a long time, right? I mean, I always treated you like my kid brother even though you're older to me. You always did me a lot of favors. Took care of me, I took care of you. We're like brothers. I mean, I don't have a brother and you don't have a brother. I got a sister. I know you have a sister. You've met her. I know Carmela. You changed the subject on me, I'm talking to you. 'Man, you did me a lot of favors Serge.' I always told you, I would watch out for you. This is just the beginning. We made a lot of money. We're gonna make a lot more money. 'We're gonna be staying in nice places like this all the time.' We're gonna be with different people we're gonna be dressing different, acting different. - The best for us. - I do. That's why I want you to do me a favor. - Name it. - Promise? Don't wear sneakers anymore. - Not even new ones? - Not even new ones. Alright? Alright. Thanks. I'm gonna get some ice and we're gonna celebrate. 'We'll get a bottle of scotch' we're gonna drink till we throw up. - Okay. - First class. Right. What should we leave the maid? [whistles] [whistling continues] [dramatic music] [indistinct chattering] [intense music] [music continues] [phone rings] [ringing continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Look, it's in East Orange, it's Spinoza or Nork. It had to be one of 'em. Not unless they got somebody from New York. 'What do you think?' What do I think? I don't know. I'm confused. [blows] How much did you say you got? Around 40,000. The radio said 60,000. Radio's full of shit. It's 40,000, some change maybe. What's the difference, the money's gone. Well I just wanna know if I lost 6000 dollars or 4000 dollars. 'That's all the difference it makes to me.' There's a very funny coincidence. I send you out on two jobs twice you get the money and twice you lose it. You know what I think? I think you killed them and took the money for yourself. I killed them? Yeah, you killed them. - What's the matter with you? - 'What's the matter with me?' Out of three jobs three fucking jobs, I wind up with $320 that's what's the matter with me. 'You've made some like a $100,000 'slip through your hand, I wind up with 320' 'you don't think I've a right to be a little bit pissed off?' Who do you think you're jerking off? You think I'm holdin' out on you? Yeah, I think you're holdin' out on me. After all what I did for you. I take you out of scrape after scrape I put money in your pocket, I talk up for you I took you out of the hole 50 times. You're like a son to me. You're gonna get my whole business. 'Your business?' You walk around this neighborhood like Scalese. Think you got armies working for you. Who the hell are you? You should walk with this attitude but from now on I don't let you play don anymore! I don't give a shit what you think! I never did. You're a fucking pimp! 'You fucking pimp!' You're a fucking pimp! I'm sorry you feel that way. [door opens] [door closes] [instrumental music] Wait a minute, wait a minute, what're you doing in here? I don't know who you are. Now, get the hell outta here. 'Spinoza, who's got the contracts.' What contract? What the hell are you talkin' about? [Jerry] 'Spinoza..' What do you want? I wanna know who's got the contracts. [music continues] Maybe you didn't hear me. He killed two of my friends. 'Give him up.' [intense music] [music continues] [knocking on door] - Marley! - How you doin', old timer? - Fine, how you doin'? - Looking good. Hey, haven't seen you in a while too. What you been doin'? Oh, a little of this and a little of that. So, what you got for me? Clean it up for me, okay? Well, you go and do what you gotta do and, uh get back here say about five, it'll be ready. What about my special order? Oh, it's been ready, you were supposed to get here last week. 'I've been busy.' Well, here it is. 'Cut the barrel down to 18 inches' one half inch is off the stock. And everything now goes together like newlyweds. Twenty eight seconds. Not bad for a novice. I'll take it. Alright. What about my bread, man? That would be on my credit card. [laughs] You.. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [phone rings] Hello. Hey, Gus, how are you? He did? Alright. Yeah, give me a couple of minutes, I'll be right down. Thanks, Gus. Hey, Paula, I'm gonna run out for a few minutes. Oh, come on, do you have to leave right now? Dinner's almost ready. Don't worry dinner will keep. Besides, uh, this is more important. Who knows? I might even come home with a surprise for you. [intense music] How you feeling, alright, Gus? Yeah, a little tired, I worked late last night. Got a lot to do. You know, I want you to know I really appreciate you told me about this camper, means a lot to my girl. Now this camper, where is it? Over here? Down here about a 100 yards, you'll see it. Is it in good shape? Yeah, the body needs a little work. - The engine's good? - Yeah. - Good price? - For you? Sure. You're the best. Maybe she's right, my girl. A camper to get out of the neighborhood a few weeks. Eh, I don't know. So, you're getting old, I wanna see you retire soon as I make this score you know you got a piece of me right? [intense music] 'Hey, Gus, it looks like it may even run.' Hey, Gus, where you goin'?
