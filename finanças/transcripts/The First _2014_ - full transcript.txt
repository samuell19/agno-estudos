Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha Come on. Please. Don't be afraid. I'm right here, with you. Julie? You are right here with me. You are right here with me. This is David speaking, please leave a message at the tone. I miss you. Sorry I got so obsessed with Earl Whitters but three innocent people were killed. So how often do you think about the events of the night of February 29th? I suppose I should lie if I want you to clear me? I suppose I should know if you're lying. Every single night. Have you been following the treatment of... Ativan 5 milligrams, every single day. Did you work on those cognitive exercises we discussed? Yes, sir. You went to the emergency ward of St. Mary's hospital with sever anxiety and panic attack symptoms. Two hours later you left without doctor's consent. On February 29th I got a call from an informant. Earl Whitters was two blocks away from the hospital. This is was your case. He had already raped and murdered three innocent women. There was no way I was going to let him go. You approached the house in the backyard and... I knew he was hiding somewhere. -Mom, please, don't. We're leaving. Stop, don't hurt me! No! Freeze! And there he was. Earl Whitters the murderer. But I couldn't shoot. So, what did you do then? How did it feel? Can't answer that question. You disobeyed the orders of your direct superior. Hello? Sara, it's Dad. Hi, Dad. Who are you guarding? I'm fine. Dad, it's so great to hear from you. - Honey? - Hello? Dad, is everything okay? - Can you hear me? - Hello? Honey? - Dad, I can't hear you. Hello? - Sarah, you're sister's gone! - What? - Elena had an accident. - What do you mean she's gone? - Elena... Dad, hello? Hello? Hello? Come on... The number you have reached is not in service. Mom... Okay... Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up. Elena, pick up. The number you have reached... - Long night? Long week. Basing on the psychiatric evaluation they're putting you on a suspension, Sara, Well, you're a good cop. Sara. You should fight this. You just can't give up. Now look, I have a friend in internal affairs. I can get you reevaluated. - When? - A couple of days, maybe. That's not much time. That's all we have. You know, my father called me last night. My little sister, she's been missing. And I can't seem to get ahold of anyone out there to tell me what's going on. Can't you get a friend, a neighbor to get ahold of her? Marta used to be my best friend, but I'm not even sure if she still lives in the island. Do you know anyone there? I wouldn't place too much confidence on the agencies down there. I should know. The simplest thing takes a couple of months. Is there any way to speed up the process? I gotta go. I'll keep you posted! Hello? Mom? Dad? Anyone home? Dad? Mom! Sara. My beautiful girl. - When did you get here? - Just now. Dad called me. He told me about Elena. Any news? No. And... and Dad? He went to Managua for a couple of days to get some help. He said he has a friend that can help him somehow. - I don't know. - You know, I was talking to him and we've got cut off, and I've been trying to call here, but - I couldn't get through. - These are difficult times, honey. Very difficult. These are some of our new neighbors. - This is Sara. - Hi. Oh, my gosh, how long has it been? - Two years. - You look beautiful. Aw, mom, thanks. Mom, when was the last time you saw Elena? She was coming back from the volcano, with Julian. They had an accident and no one's seen her since. - And Julian? - He's in the hospital. But he doesn't remember anything. Listen, you look tired, why don't I make you something? -Mom, where was the accident? At the base of the volcano. Sara Mendoza. Hello, lieutenant, pleasure to see you. Welcome home. I hear you are a police officer of the American now Have you questioned the driver? - We're not as stupid as you think, officer. So how far in the investigation are you? Well if you look inside, it looks like your sister's boyfriend was driving. He's in shock. Very close tho having his arm amputated. So I'm going to say his memory's not that good right now. And what's the cause of the accident? Cause of the accident is a blown tire. I don't think I need to remind you, Sara, that any information you obtain you need to share with me. - Right? - Don't worry. I'm not worried. I seriously doubt you're gonna find anything we haven't found already. And I assume you already have a theory on my sister's disappearance? A theory? Yeah, I have a theory. My theory is your sister was not inside that vehicle. I've seen hundreds of cases like this before. I'm sure it was nothing more than a simple argument amongst young love. - Fine. I wanna question the boyfriend. - You wanna question the boyfriend? I do. Well, unfortunately what I want from you is I want you to get I your little preppy jeep over there and I want you to drive down the read and go home. And I want you to wait. Let's go. - Smells good. - Indio viejo, your favorite. How could I forget? Go wash up for dinner, honey. Okay? Okay. Use Elena's room; you'll be more comfortable there. Thanks, mom. Don't go to your room, honey. You know, with this island being as small as it is, I can't believe no one's seen her. Mom? Julian's not from here, right? Did they get along? Oh, they were happy. Planning on getting married and starting a family. And did Elena happen to have any enemies or problems with anyone? Oh, sorry mom, I have to take this. Sargent? Hello? - Any luck with your sister? - No, no, not yet. I'm sorry to hear that. Listen, you have to get back here as soon as possible. I got the reevaluation. It will be on Monday. Monday? But that's in two days. This is your very last chance, Sara. I made it a point to stress that. Sara? - Fine, fine, fine. I'll be there. - Alright, I'm glad to hear that. I'll call you to confirm. Sara, I stuck my neck out here for you. Don't make me look bad. Alright, thanks, Sargent. Bye. Mom? Mom? Hi. I'm looking for Julian Rodriguez. Thank you. Sara? - Sara! Oh, my god! - Miriam. - Good to see you. - Good to see you, too. I heard what happened. Any word on Elena yet? That's why I need to see Julian. Is he here? Visits are not allowed. He comes in and out of consciousness. Asking for his girlfriend and crying. He became a bit violent today. We had to sedate him. Do you think that with this type of fracture in his arm it's possible he could have done this to himself? Not likely. They had to insert four screws just to stabilize the bone. He's looking at a very long and painful rehab. - And would he recover any movement? - Maybe 20% at best. I'm sorry for all this, Sara. Look, I promise I will keep an eye on him. As soon as he's able to talk, I will let you know. Okay? Thanks. I wish I was here under better circumstances. I know, baby. Oh, by the way, how's Marta doing? Is she still living here on the island? - No one told you? =About what? - Marta killed herself. - What?! - When? - A couple of months ago. Oh, my god. I actually wondered why you didn't come to the funeral. I would've if I would've known. - But, what happened? - No one knows for sure. One day she took the fairy to the train station and... she jumped into the tracks. Sorry, I... I thought someone told you. Honey, I have to go, but it was really nice to see you again. - Good luck with Elena, okay? - Thanks, Miriam. Hi... - What do you want? - I'm looking for the missing girl. She's my sister. - I'm Sara. - I know who you are. - Did you see anything? - I don't know anything. Did you hear that I'm crazy? You look pretty normal to me. Listen... um, could I trouble you for some coffee? My mother's is terrible. Mother! We have visitors. My mother. Hi. I'm Sara. - Nice to meet you. - She had a stroke. She hasn't walked or talked in two years. So, I saw you spying on me yesterday. How come? A lot of strange people lately. - I don't know who to trust. - Thanks. Uh huh. Did you see or hear anything about the accident? Does it matter? You're not gonna believe me, anyway. I don't make shit up, okay? There were... there were lights, okay? In the sky, and... and they came down. You see? You think I'm making shit up, eh? Get out! Get out, get out, get out! No, no, no, no, wait. So there were lights. Was it a plane? There're are no planes here. There were lights. I believe you. Uh huh. Uh huh. Okay. I'm going to show you something. Okay? - Uh huh. - Uhm. Okay. How often do you use that riffle? Every day. These are old, okay? You see? Uh? - Stars? - No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Those are not stars. There's another one here. Hmm? - Let me see? You see? You see that? Over here? There's someone there. I'm not seeing it. - You see this light? - Alright, uhm... what's your name? Pedro. Pedro, what does this have to do with my sister? - He took her. - The man in the photo? - It's not a man! Okay? - Okay... He took your sister, just like he took everyone else in town. Hmm? I saw him. Here. You see? You see this? It's not a star. It's a spaceship. I saw it, okay? He's not human. And I'm not lying! Talk to the police, then. And you know what? Try Lieutenant Gallardo. No, not him. He's weird. Ever since his wife... - What about his wife? - She killed herself. She took his gun and she blew... her brains out. Uhm. They're all very weird in that town. Give me that. Meet me at the site of the accident tomorrow and I'm going to see if I can get the whole town to help. You think all this is normal? Go to church and see for yourself. The priest has been gone for months and people keep going every day, what do they do that? I don't know. Thanks. Father Antonio was nice. Hi. - Cold beer, please. - Yep. Thanks. I have a quick question. Do any of you know anything about Elena? Okay, uhm, has anyone seen her? Oh, come on, guys. There's no way she just disappeared into thin air! Somebody talk to me! Anybody! I know you guys know something. - Anyone? - Easy, miss. Not a good place for trouble. - She's my sister! - I know. No one has seen her. Okay, look, Iâ€™m... I'm asking, in fact, I'm begging, Please come to the site of the accident tomorrow at 11. And help me search for my sister. Hey mom. I'm so tired. We all are, mom, especially with this Elena situation. - Where were you this morning? - I... was at church. Praying for your sister. Is Dad back yet? No. - It's strange, too. - Strange is you not placing a call to me. - What happened to Gallardo's wife? - She killed herself. And so did Marta, right? I didn't want to tell you, Sara; I didn't want to upset you. - Who told you? - Pedro. You can't listen to anything that man has to say. He's crazy. What did he tell you? He's convinced that she's been kidnapped. Mom, do you think it's possible that Elena killed herself? This is David speaking. Please leave a message after the tone. Where is the murderer. You disobeyed the orders of your direct superior. Hello? - Sara Mendoza? - Speaking. This is Evelym, from Dr. Stevenson's clinic. I'm calling to confirm your appointment. Oh, yes, of course. I had you for tomorrow at noon. Tomorrow... uhm... Yeah, that... that's fine. - Alright, then, well see you tomorrow at noon. Okay. Thanks. Hi. Did you come to pick me up? I was told someone would come and pick me up. No, no, I'm Sara. Elena's sister? We need to find her! Okay, okay, okay... it's okay. Now, do you remember anything about the accident? Like where you were going that night or what caused the accident? Do you recall calling the police? I was lying on the floor, and I couldn't see Elena. I called for her, she wouldn't answer. I thought she was dead. - You need to find her. - We will, Julian. But I'm gonna need your help. Tell me what happened. - I saw somewhere there. - Where? - On the road. - Was it a man? Was it Pedro? Julian! Julian! Was it Pedro? - Lieutenant. - What the hell are you doing here? Look, I really need to speak with him right now. - Julian... - I told you. - Step aside. - Was it Pedro? - Julian! Julian! - This is not your investigation. Julian, was it Pedro? Julian?! Was it Pedro?! Julian?! Idiot! Hey, Sara, it's time for you to go home, honey. What? Listen, you've got that evaluation tomorrow at noon. But wait. Wait, mom, how do you know about that? - You told me. - No, no, I didn't. Yes, sweetheart, you did. Don't you remember last night? You were talking in your sleep when I woke you up. What did I say? You told me how your boyfriend left you. But it's okay, honey. It's okay. It's not your fault. The Sargent is waiting for you. They're going to help you. You can't let them down. - I don't remember... - Now, listen, the next ferry takes off in 20 minutes. Okay? It will give you enough time to make it to the airport. Go. You'll be fine. Mom, I can't leave without first finding Elena. My sweet girl. I know how you feel. I know Elena is going to be back safely. And your father will come home, too, and we'll be a family again. Just like we used to be. - Now go. - Mom, wait. I know for a fact that I did not tell you anything last night. You call me a liar? What's happened to you? You need to go home. Get your life in order first. Lieutenant Gallardo is doing everything he can to find your sister, and I know he will. You need to go home. Take care of yourself, please. Go. Go, my sweet girl, go. Go ahead. Take her, please. -Elena?!!!! I can't remember anything. - I don't have a ticket. - You don't need one. Nothing more than a simple argument amongst young love. He took your sister, just like he took everyone else in town. - Marta killed herself. - She killed herself. - He's not human. - He's crazy. We need to find her! Spaceship.... - What are you doing here? - You shot at them! That's why they crashed, huh? Pedro, please, please, just tell me. - Where is my sister? - He came for me last night! - Who, Pedro? Who? - He couldn't even breathe! He could barely walk, he couldn't breathe. He... he couldn't breathe. He couldn't breathe. He... he can't breathe our air! You see? He... he came with your sister, like the others. She'll be back. She'll be back, she'll be back. They kill themselves. Like, like, like, like your friend. Huh? Like Galardo's wife! They killed themselves! But he won't take me home! Because I will kill myself before, okay? Pedro... Pedro, Pedro! Listen to me. It's my sister. Please. Where is my sister? You, you, you have a sister? You're here from the FBI, right? The CIA, right? You're here to stop them, right? Oh, no... no. They're here. I can feel him. Pedro!! Pedro? Pedro? Pedro? Whoa... - It's me, Sara. - Shh, shh, shh... Shh, shh, shh... shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... He's here to get me. Shh... Don't let them take me, huh, okay? Don't get too close. They take over your thoughts. Pedro? Pedro? Pedro? See? I told you I don't make shit up. Mom? Mom? Don't go to your room. Dad? Mom!!! Mom!!! Dad... Lieutenant... Lieutenant... Julian. Julian? I remember. Sorry. I'm sorry you needed to feel so confused. But you needed to remember on your own. Soon, we will all be together. As a family. Stranded on this planet without a home. Barely able to take one single breath. Not being able to move. But when he descends upon us, when the first one comes, they should rise above the humans. Just as we rose above the animals all those years ago. Up behind me. He crashes into me because he was looking at some woman no responsibility for this [indistinct TV chatter] [indistinct TV chatter] [indistinct TV chatter] I won't let them take you. Okay? I won't. Please forgive me. Is she okay? I'm not letting her go off with you. Julian... please... please come with me. I'm not losing her again! Pedro, put the gun down! Pedro... put the gun down. I should have shot her when I had the chance, at the car. Can't you see? They're not like us. They're here for the strongest and we have to fight. Please, Pedro. Put it down. No one will believe you. Look, we'll go tell them together. I promise. Did you believe me when I told you? Please, Pedro, she's my sister. Please, Pedro. - N-not... not anymore. - Please. - Please... - Get out of the way! - Out of the way. - Pedro... Put... the... gun... down... now! He came to destroy us. We have to kill them. We have to kill them now. Pedro, please, don't make me do this, please. Don't let them take you, too. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Elena. - Lieutenant! - Elena! Finally. Your mom... she's waiting for you. Elena... Yes, my beautiful girl. You're okay. I'm so proud of you. So proud. - The first one will be born in a few days. - Let's celebrate. Your sister's finally back. You can't be happy? Dad's not coming back, you murderer! You're gonna pay for this. You should've never come back. Please don't kill me. Please! No, no, no, no, no! Help me... Please... Somebody help! Help! Somebody help! Help!! Sara.. You were always so rebellious. In a hurry to leave this place. I remember you saying nothing ever happens here. You're so wrong. We have been chosen. And it cannot survive without us. We will help it adapt. And it will teach us. And it will better us all. It's a blessing. And what about all those people who killed themselves? What about my dad? Well, they weren't ready. We are. And we must move forward. And that unborn child Elena is carrying will lead the way. God bless them. Don't worry. It's okay. I'm here with you. - It's growing so fast! - It's perfect. What will happen to Sara? She will be charged for killing Pedro, but don't worry about that now. - What if she talks and tells what she saw? - They will never believe her. They'll think that she's crazy, like Pedro. She doesn't deserve it. What about if I can talk to her and convince her to live with us? Even become pregnant. Like me. She's not like us. Please, at least let me try! She will never understand. Is everything alright? How's my grandson? How is he? She needs to rest; take her inside. Go. Take her inside. I don't know. She was chosen. She has that same look on her face my wife did. Then it'll have to be Sara. Elena. Put... put... put the gun down. Don't, mama. Don't even think about it. Elena. What's wrong? - Elena! Open the door. - You betrayed me. - Open the door! - You gave me away. - I love you. - I'm not like you! The First One. Will. Never. Be. Born. Elena. I love you... Sara! Sara, let's go! Come on, Sara. Come on, let's go! - Why are you doing this? - You are my sister. Take this. Okay. - Let's go. - Elena! Elena! Elena! Elena? Elena?! You can do this, okay? Come on, let's go. Elena! The gun. Give me your gun! Give me your gun now! Wait. Let's go. Elena, come with me. Come on, Elena, let's go. Come on. Sara! - You should've never come back. - No! Elena, Elena, get out of the way! Elena... Let's go. - Are you okay? - It's coming! I feel it. It's hard. You have to. No one knows her child better than her mother. You should be proud! This child that you carry - belongs to all of us. - No, mommy! I know you're scared, but it's going to happen no matter what. - Let me help you. - Stop! Get away from me, Sara! - No, mama. - I'm right here. Please, mama. This is gonna be the first of its kind, Elena. You should be so proud. - You can do this. - No, please! Get away from me, Sara! You could have been the Chosen One. This could've been you! You don't deserve it! I am so ashamed of you! Elena... Elena... Elena! Sara, shoot Mama. You have to shoot her. Right in the head. Don't, Sara. Please, don't. Sara Mendoza, I'm calling from Dr. Stevenson's office. We have the results of your evaluation. Please pick them up at any time. Thank you. Officer. Officer. I'm so glad to inform you: you've passed your evaluation. You're all set to go back into service. By the way, you spoke quite a lot about your sister. Did you get a chance to see her? You were always so stubborn. I love that about you. I wish I could have been like you. Elena... you're perfect the way that you are. You know how it is. I don't understand. You have to kill me. - I won't do it. - You have to! - No, Elena. I won't do it. - We don't have enough time! No... I will give birth at any moment! It can't happen! If The First is born, it will be the end of all. - Do you understand? - No, Elena. I came here to find you! I'm not gonna do it! This one I saved for me. Please. Please. - I love you. - I love you.
