- Goodbye, Brigadier. - Go, go. Doesn't the engine start? - Did you put gas in it? - I don't know. Get off and let me see. Get off. - What a lovely purse! Is it yours? - Yes, it's mine. Alright. Now I'll try. See? Go on. Go, go! These modern young men with a purse! What are we coming to? - Thief! Brigadier! - What is it? - My purse was stolen! - Keep calm. One at a time. I understood. Why are you hollering? I'll follow the thief! Stop! FBI! Police! Move over! I'll take care of him, madam! I'll get him! - I must pay my car installment! - I don't give a darn! - What are you doing? - There are steps! - You're having me risk my life! - Don't worry about your life! What matters is catching the thieves! Justice demands justice! Don't cry. Will you stop or not? I'll kick you out! Slowly! - Where did the thief go? - I must go to the bank! - He was here. I don't understand. - Me neither. Who is it? The thief! He's calling me. On the other side? - He's not here! - Where is he? Up there! I'll take care of him. Scoundrel, come down! Help! Help! - Thieves! Thieves! - 9. Forget 9! - The robbers! - 37. Forget 37. Call the police! Call the police. Hurry! I'll kill you! They robbed the Lottery Ticket place with that green van! - I'll take care of it! - I must go to the bank! Delinquents! They shortened my car! Look at what's happened! Where are we going now? We'll cut him off the road! Where... are you going? Help! Help! This is it! Murderer! Delinquent! Scoundrel! You've ruined my store! - Delinquent! Scoundrel! - Excuse him, miss. Look! Delinquents! Fortunately, there are no victims. I don't care. Pay for the store damages! - It's his car. - Then take this! Stop! Stop! I'm a police officer! - We're not hitting anyone here! - Really? Are you with the police force? Then arrest him. He crashed here and must pay the damage! - How much is the damage? - Three, six, carry one... - 5,000 Liras. - Give the lady 5,000 Liras. - Me? - Must I give it to her? - Who will pay the car damages? - You. Give her 5,000 Liras. - Yes, here. - Here's 5,000 Liras. You can go. I should fine you for having gotten in the way. - Me? - Who else? My sister? - You have a license? Show it to me! - Darn... - Show it to me! - One minute! I'll look for it. - Here's my license. - Let's see who you are. - That's me. - I see your lovely face. Yes, it's in order. This is yours, but don't ever use it. Miss! Miss! Just a minute. Excuse me, but these road pirates are scattered everywhere. They are the disgrace of all humanity. Right? I see you smoke a lot. Too young to smoke. I began at 16. Brigadier Petralia! - Leave it! - Let me see! Give me the screwdriver! What did the brigadier tell you? Do you know him? That idiot almost killed me! Did he see the contraband cigarettes? No! He didn't notice a thing. He said not to smoke too much. He didn't say anything, and you treated him like that? Are you mad? In our job a policeman is convenient. - Is this how you help the family? - Yes. It's your fault. You spoiled her too much! - If you repeat it, I'll slap you. - Dad, you already did. - Did you open the safe? - We couldn't do it. Nobody knows how to open it. Not one of them is like me! You're off to a good start! Darn it! Darn it! Only I have to work in this house. Vitto', only you know how much Ferdinando the Baron is worth. Enough! You've been talking to Victor Emanuel for 30 years! Leave the dead in peace! What do you want with that 1915-1918 war? - It was an important war. - Really? It was a world war. World war? Stop! Stop with this world war! It's useless. You are nothing. You're a scoundrel, a worm, a delinquent. You know that? - And you're a loafer! - No! Nobody ever said that to me! - Well, I'm telling you! - I demand respect! - Mom, give a good example. - Be quiet or I'll slap you. First they do things and then threaten them! - This son of a loafer! - You mean me? It's not my fault. I'm his son. Enough! Get out of this house! Go away! - I am a baron! - A commode baron! Go away! Go work! - First quality. - Pascalone, the brigadier! - May I help you? - Are you looking for something? - This is how I like offices. - Please... How many lovely coconuts! Where were you on the morning of June 15th 1974? June 15th 1974? June 15th? That's today! In fact. - Where were you this morning? - Where were we? Here. - No, at the Lottery Tickets place. - The Lottery Tickets place? You were there to get a winning for a "terno" that you played. - Did you by chance win a "terno"? - No. Then it was you. You can't get rid of the gambling vice. I don't know how to bet! - Did you hear? - I heard. I arrest you with the accusation of armed robbery! Stop! Are you crazy? You don't know what you're saying. Yes, I do know what I'm saying. You must prove the opposite! - You have evidence of being here? - Evidence? Of course. - Then give it to me. - Judas! Judas! This is Judas, our trusted man. - Did we go out this morning? - No. - Did any of our vans go out? - No. Do you know if any of us left the office? Did you hear? We can believe our Judas. He is a church-going man. - Oh, church-going... - God fearing. - A man of faith. - A scoundrel! What're you doing? Go! Get out! - Go! - Keep away! Dear sir, you called us thieves, but who are you? - What do you want? What is this all about? Oh, then... you gentlemen know me? I am Brigadier Petralia, the neighborhood Serpico! So you'll come with me to the station! Start going! - You are crazy! - Let go. What are you doing? Let go! Leave him alone. Don't bother with him. Anyway, the police incriminates, and the law acquits. Brigadier, let's recapitulate. The stolen goods weren't found. No license you gave me was found corresponding to the gentlemen's van. Each license is composed of 5 numbers. You didn't guess one! - I read very well. - Why did you bother the gentlemen? Bothered us? He brought us here in chains! - I was chained too. - In fact! How shameful! In front of the personnel. An outrageous offense! What about the right of the citizen? I understand. If the gentlemen feel they must file a report... No, Chief. We don't want to make matters worse for this poor man. Poor man? I saw them run away! I brought the Lottery Ticket place manager for identification. Is the robbed man here? Couldn't you tell me that? - Let him in! - Come. Chief, this is the shop owner. - Well? What about the thieves? - Thieves? That's number 9. What are you saying? The chief wants to know about the robbers. - Robbers is number 37. - Are you off your rocker? - Is it them or not? - Who? - The gentlemen. - I don't know them. You don't? You said they entered and robbed you. - You know them. - I've never seen them before. - Send him away. - I don't know them. Brigadier Petralia! Have him go outside! Go, go, go, go! He doesn't know them! An unpleasant misunderstanding. The police apologizes. No need, Chief. No hard feelings. The citizens are at the service of the police. - I am at your service. - No, we're at your service. Very kind of you. This way. I'll accompany you. Goodbye. - See you. - Please. - Brigadier Petralia! - Yes, sir. Any time you arrest people, bring evidence of their offenses! - Yes, sir. - Evidence! Don't embarrass me like this anymore, or next time I'll transfer you! - I wanted... - Go away! - I wanted to tell you... - Go! Don't drive me crazy! I'll go, but I wanted to tell you... - Go away! - Alright, but it's as I say! - Let's make it 1,500. - What? - Bitch! - You again! Brigadier Petralia. How are you? Why are you in the area? Well... Actually... I came that way, and I'm going... - That way. - This way. I'm passing by. May I offer you a coffee? I'd love one, but I'm busy. Why don't you come have coffee at our place? At your house? At your house? I... With pleasure, but later. I am on duty now. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. So, listen.. Try to act properly, as civil people. Don't be scoundrels or I'll wallop you! My sons aren't scoundrels. There's only one scoundrel in this house and it's you. - Mom, stop it! - Shut up! - Mom! Mom, stop it! - He always opens his mouth! He's knocking on the door! - Go open. - You go. - You go. - Alright, I'll go. - Good evening. - Good evening. My family. Baron Ferdinando Quagliarulo, descendent of the Barons of Swabia. Shit! - What a lie! - Be quiet! - The baron, my son. - I'm honored. - My wife. - Pleased to meet you. My jewels. Madam, allow me to give you this floral homage. Thank you! Thank you. - They smell so nicely! - They are fresh. Not like these! Lovely! Please, sit down. - The chair broke! - It's an antique piece. I'm sorry. Did you hurt yourself? - Here? Did you hurt yourself here? - It's nothing. - Move! - I am used to it. Where should I sit down? Excuse me. It can happen to anyone. Antique stuff. So... I'll go make coffee. - Yes. - Yes, coffee. - Coffee. - Coffee. - May I? - Please. - Please. - Yes, thank you. Thank you. - Here. - Thank you. Here! I made some good coffee. This coffee is delicious! - That's enough. - How much sugar? - Two. - Two. Little sugar, huh? Thanks. I'll stir it. I like to stir it. As I was saying... Since I'm a policeman, I am not allowed to say many things. They are secret. It's dangerous to talk. It's true. Tomorrow I have to take part in a drugs operation. - Drugs? - Jeepers! - Who is "Jeepers"? - Jeepers, Dad. - Jeepers, creepers... - I don't understand. - For the sum of 100,000 dollars. - 100,000 dollars? - 100,000 dollars? - 100,000. As I said, unfortunately, I can't tell anyone these things. - I don't even advise the station. - Where? - In Mergellina. - In Mergellina. - In Mergellina? - Yes, at noon. - At 12. - At 12 on the dot. - And... The number? - Number 24. - 24, Dad. - 24, 24. But I can't say these things. They are "top". They are "pop". Not "pop", but "top". - Tot! - Not exactly. It's a word the police uses. Top... What? Tip, top, my head hurts. I don't understand a thing! - Unfortunately, it's late. - Goodbye, Brigadier. - Thank you. - Goodbye, madam. - My respects and thank you. - Goodbye. Baron. We policemen are very busy. - Goodbye! Goodbye! - Goodbye! - Too bad you are leaving! - Duty calls me. - When will I see you again? - As soon as possible. Brigadier, I admire men who keep silent, with all my heart. We of the policemen are silent. So I noticed. See you. Bye. - Bye to all! - Bye. Brigadier! Brigadier, are these yours? - Yes, they're mine. - You forgot them on the table. I don't remember pulling them out. You police force people handcuff very easily. - We do what we can. Thanks. - Goodbye, Brigadier. By the way, is this yours? - It's mine! How is it possible? - It was under the chair. Under your the chair. I'm sorry, I'm distracted. - Flowers and firearms! - Say hello to Maria. - Goodbye. - I am so scatterbrained! You weren't expecting it, huh? You fell for it this time! Here's the coke. Hurry. Take everything to the station! Stop! Stop! Darn them! Stop! - What do you want? You again? - I have to follow the van! - Move over! - I just bought it! - I don't care! - I didn't pay the first installment! Why always me? Why always my car? - Be careful! - Keep your hands off! Be careful! Go slowly! They stole my spaghetti! I chase thieves and you eat? - Want some? - Oh, stop it! Go! Very good! My spaghetti again! Another plate of spaghetti? Very kind of him. He gave me another plate. - It's good! - First we capture, and then we eat! - Where is he? - I'm eating it. To heck with you! Holy Mary, the spaghetti! My spaghetti! I had you stop by the spaghetti man. Eat this, too. Are you having a second course? Take it away. It's raw. He eats raw octopus. All we needed was the fog! Help! Darn... - Everything is upside down. - Yes. The world must have overturned. - Hello, Chief? - Hello? I'll give you some good news. I arrested two drug dealers. They had drugs worth 100,000 dollars! Hello? Chief Pappacoda? Chief Pappacoda? Hello? - Is it a joke? - No, it's the truth. They're in front of me. What should I do? - Put them under pressure. - Where? - Question them! - Oh, I must question them! - I'm coming! - You're coming? Yes, sir. Well, well... So you wanted to be wise guys. You tied yourselves to confuse me. But you won't make it with me! Silence! Did I make that clear? The police is something serious, so empty out the bag! - What are you doing? - Going out to empty the bag. They must empty the bag, not you! You'd better answer. I don't have time to waste on you. I caught you red-handed so now you must talk. If you don't, I will... Brigadier Petralia! I don't want acts of violence in this office. The arm of the law must not be violent. They don't want to talk. They don't want to talk? Good for them! - They don't want to talk. - They don't want to talk. How can they speak? They are tied and gagged! Right. I hadn't noticed! Why didn't you untie them? I don't touch anything until the police comes. - Brigadier Petralia, untie them. - Yes, sir. I'll take care of it. Good, good, good. - Brigadier Petralia. - I'm untying them. What are you doing? Brigadier Petralia! - I'm untying them. - You'll strangle them! - Be careful, Petralia! - I can't... I want to hear them sing out now. Not you. They must talk! Calm down. Let's relax. So! How did the facts take place? We were watching television and someone knocked. I opened and there were three bandits, masked and armed. They tied us up and left. - Do you have a cigarette? - A cigarette? How do you explain the bag with cocaine? It's not ours. It was put there to get us in trouble for revenge. - Where is the bag? - It's here. We'll see! You wanted to be wise guys, but you can't fool me! - Petralia, I'm here. - The chief is here! Are you kidding? 100,000 dollars. Scoundrels! I'm here. - What is this? - It's cocaine! - What is it? - Cocaine! - It's baby powder! - Powder... Petralia, smell! It's baby powder! Baby powder? You scum! What are you doing? Separate them! - Stop! - Stop! Stop! - Let him go! Will you stop it? - Delinquent! Look at these two... Don't hit each other! Stop! I'll show you! Get out, you delinquents! Get out, delinquents! - Everyone out! Criminals! - Me? What've you got to do with it? Go! Chief! What is it? You need something? - Do you feel ill? - Brigadier Petralia. - Yes, sir. - You've made various mistakes. - What? - Firstly. You didn't advise about what you were doing. - I apologize. - Secondly! You had 100,000 dollars of cocaine swiped from under your nose. Thirdly, you arrested two known drug dealers and since pushing baby powder is admitted in Italy, we can only arrest them for brawl. - I am mortified. - Fifthly! - Fourthly, Chief. Fourthly... This will cost you a transfer. Someone is informing the robbers, the thieves! Do you suspect anyone? The duty of a policeman is to suspect everyone. By the way, did you ever say anything at home? Me? What are you saying? - At the barber's, the grocer's? - No one, I swear. Car number 7. Go immediately to Via del Pellegrino, 25. Anonymous call, there is a dead body. Perriconi, Sardina, don't let anyone by. Close it off. Come. Hurry! The dead man? Where are you going? Get out. Get out. Get out! Where're you going? When we call the cafe, it's always late. Go! Go! What're you doing? Get out. - Everyone go home! - Go out. We did everything, huh? Everyone out! Go do housework and end this big act! You can't kid around with Petralia. Get out! Go on! - Yes, sir. - Have an ambulance come. Right away. I am surprised at you. A man of faith plays these little games! You fix him up like a check to be cashed. Dear son, there's been a mistake. He is not the dead man. He's not the dead man? Did you hear him? He's not dead! If this guy isn't dead, who is? - The murdered man is above. - Above? In Paradise? Paradise? He is on the upper floor. - Then he... - Let me work. Isn't he the dead man who was murdered? I didn't know. I'm on the wrong floor. I apologize. Excuse me. I didn't know... I apologize. I didn't know. - My condolences. - Fuck off! Excuse me! You are so ugly! I have to be brave. A man in the police force can't be afraid. Brigadier Petralia! Put him up. Oh, Lord! Easy, huh? Careful, don't break him. Keep calm! Keep calm! Lower him like this. Lower him. There. Enter... keep calm. His head! You see, Chief, the thieves seem to have stolen small stuff. Candles, some gifts and some pews. In my church there is a painting attributed to Correggio. If that should disappear, the damage would be incalculable! - Worth billions! - Does the darn window panel close? - Darn? - Excuse me. I meant "blessed". We can't. Restoration works will continue a bit longer. Don't worry. I'll send you the proper night surveillance. - God will reward you. - Don't worry. The police is at the service of the Vatican. Good evening, Brigadier. - What are you doing here at night? - Maria sent us. She's afraid you'll catch a cold. - In the month of June? - She sends you hot coffee. Maria had a kind thought for me. - She doesn't give a damn. - Don't speak like that! At your age. Shame on you! - Is there any sugar? - I'll check. Let me see. I am no expert. There is. There was! Brigadier, are you waiting for the thieves? - The thieves? What thieves? - Those who are leaving. - They're getting away! - Stop! Come back! Stop! Stop! - What'll I do? Thank goodness. Stop! - We're coming too! Follow that car! You again? Move over! What do you mean? You're bringing your family too? Help! Get this madman off my back! Help! Be quiet! Right or left? You are confusing me. Stop! Go slowly! The fire! Just a moment. I'll stop and ask. - What fire do you mean? - The one over there! - Do you think I'm an idiot? - Yes... I mean no. Everyone out. Go on! Children, don't dirty the car! If you have to pee, go over there. Listen, excuse me. Did you see a van go by? Ten thousand. - Ten thousand. - I don't believe it! Fire! I told him that there was a fire! Extinguish it! I am ruined. I haven't even paid the second instalment... How did you... How did you let the Correggio be taken away? Me? It slipped. - The world press is talking about it. - "Il Corriere dello Sport". - Those too? - It's part of the press. "A team of thieves breaks Brigadier Petralia's defense line." "While dribbling, it conquers the Correggio." "Therefore in Naples, thieves 1, police 0". "We expect the substitution of the coach." They expect that. - "L'Osservatore Romano". - The "Osservatore" is observing us. Read, read. "The Vatican is in a turmoil because of a Correggio." Right. Yes? Holiness! Certainly, Holiness. I will do my best. I will personally take the situation in hand. - Praised be Jesus Christ. - Praised now and forever. - Praised now and forever. - Amen. - The Chief of Police! - The Chief of Police! Chief Pappacoda! What are you up to? - The minister called me all night! - I am not... - And the authorities too! - Excuse me, sir... - What is happening here? - I'm not the chief... - The thief? - No, I'm Chief Pappacoda. - So he is the thief! - No, he's the priest... - Who are you? - Chief Pappacoda. - I am Brigadier Petralia. - Oh, Brigadier Petralia! The one that let the Correggio get away! - It's a tough moment. - Did you at least see the thieves? Yes. I saw one in the face, an unforgettable face. - I could even paint him. - Good. - Then let's do an identikit! - Let's do an identikit. - Marshal, come on! - I am a priest. - May I? - Please. Ready. Turn around! It's him! - He is the Savior! - He looks like a criminal. - Arrest him. - Yes! - Are you sure? - Very sure. This... is for the other time. Don Pascalone, 30,000 liras? You should know that the sun was behind a cloud, the sea was rough, and there was sand on the shore. The landing took place in Anzio. One times six is six. One times seven is seven, carry a two. - Did you understand? - Of course. Don Pascalone, if... If we had known that the sun was behind a cloud, we'd have brought an umbrella. - Very good. I'm glad you understood. Modestly speaking... - Can we go? - Please, please. No, don't worry. Go. Go. - Everything is in order. - Go around the block. - Madam! - Brigadier Petralia, how are you? - How long ago did I see you? - Well... last night. Right. How forgetful! - What are you doing? - I'm on duty at the Bank of the Gulf. Really? - Aren't you afraid? - Of what? - Afraid of bandits. - Bandits? They know I'm here and won't come. He is a serious professional! Look how handsome he is. Really attractive! He is armed, with a gun. All policemen have guns. I made a wonderful lunch for you!? - Thank you! - Please her! - Everyone freeze! - This is a holdup. - Don't get wise, and go to the wall! - Go on, the wall! Open up the safe! Open the safe! Put it inside. Put it inside! - Is this a marshal's uniform? - No, it's civilian clothes. - Mom, you are embarrassing me. - Oh, no. Where are you headed? - May I keep my salary? - No. Put it inside! Everyone freeze! Stop! Accompany us to buy groceries. I'd love to, but I'm so unlucky that if I move, they'll rob the bank. - Move. Thief! Brigadier, that green van! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry, get me a car! - Move! Move, police! - Call a car! - Move aside! - Bring salts for my daughter! - There we are. - Let's go. Help! If you continue hollering, I'll slap you. - Here they are! - Forget it! - They have a right to eat. - That's nonsense! We'll cut them off here. The police gives thanks. Murderers! Murderer! SS! SS! Let me go. Let me go! - Don't touch me! - Who's touching you? Did someone... - Nobody touched him. - We want to know. Look at how he looks at me! He's a cannibal! - It's Cuccurullo. - I have children! - You wanted to kill me. - Us? We just want to know one thing. Keep calm. Don't yell, please! We want to know something important. - You pulled my tooth! - He wants a tooth! - Give me my tooth! - You didn't have it when you came. - I did. There are witnesses! - What witnesses? I'll report you for theft of my denture! What are you saying? Help! They want to strangle me! - Let me breathe! - Let him breathe! Let him breathe! Well? I confiscated a pack of drugged cigarettes. As usual, no drug addict was stuck to the pack. Unfortunately, he managed to escape. What did he do? He killed his three brothers and doesn't want to say why. You want me to try? - You try. I'm having a coffee. - I'll be quick. Help! Be quiet! Don't make me angry! - You must talk to me! - Yes. Don't worry. Nobody will touch you. Now tell me something. Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes. - Is he a dragon? - Do you like candies? - Yes. - Do you like them? Brigadier Petralia gives a candy to Bun. - Is your name Bun? - No. - Roll? - Not that either. - What is your name? - Sandwich. Like my brother, Giovanni. Here is the candy. Is it good? Now tell me the truth. Why did you kill your 3 brothers? Because my 3 brothers were disobedient. And you killed all 3 of them? Why did you kill all 3 of them? They didn't want to walk in twos. Don't try to trick me or I'll kill you! I won't give you candies anymore! Tell me the truth and I'll give them. - You want a candy? - No, I don't. - Have a candy. - I don't want it. - Have a candy! - I don't want it. - Then what do you want? - A cigarette. A cigarette! I'll give it to you, but you must tell me the truth. Wait. Do you have a cigarette? Right. The salary is so low. Here they are! Your cigarette. - They must smoke too. - We all must smoke. - I don't smoke. - You must smoke. It's what our client wants. Here. We'll light it now. I have a lighter. I'll light it. I'll light it. That's it. Here. Here. That's it. Hello, police? I'd like to report some drug addicts. Call 113. Hello! Hello! Police! - Marijuana! - Call 113! Brigadier Petralia! My... My head is spinning! Brigadier Petralia! My balls are spinning! Brigadier Petralia... Brigadier, you're disguising yourself again? Night Club Operation. Did you bring the bulletproof vest? - Here it is. - Help me. - This one has holes! - Of course. It's used. Pera brothers, we'll see who wins! Romantic, suffering, refined. Women find me old-fashioned. They criticize my gaiters and my white gloves. - Everything is set, Brigadier. - Idiot! Don't call me "Brigadier". - Don't you see I'm disguised? - Alright, Brigadier. I'm the last handsome man around. What can I do? This way. Come... Brigadier Petralia, a mazurka, please. For me, love is life. I can't do without it! I drown my sorrow in champagne. They are sad days for who has always loved. My woman doesn't want me like this anymore. She prefers a young bearded men... - Excuse me! - Brigadier Petralia. Have you finished playing? I've finished playing. Sit down. Keep us company. Please. - If you want me to. - Please. Let's talk a bit. - Director! - Here I am. A chair for Brigadier Petralia, right away! Sit down, please. Go ahead. Bravo, Brigadier Petralia. A little champagne? Pure, French, original. Here it is. Brigadier Petralia, you always go hunting. You never get tired. You don't get tired... - He never gets tired. - He likes acting like a dog. Yes, you're right. I enjoy acting like a Neapolitan Mastiff. Maybe one day I'll catch my prey. - Bravo. Drink. - No, thanks. I don't drink. French champagne goes to my head. I am on duty. You are offending me. I am not offending anyone. Have a good time. Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me. I won't do it anymore. 70, 80, 90 and 100. 100,000 liras? The Pera brothers get rich with the millions of the bank and give you 100,000 liras for information? You're a jerk! Hey! You're my wife but I won't allow such things! - I'll slap you! - Slap me? Go on! Mom! 100,000 liras for information is not little. You're a worse jerk than your dad. - Who is it? Who is it? - Police. - The police! - Keep calm. It's Brigadier Petralia who has come to see me. - Brigadier... - Petralia. Good morning. How are you? Fine, and you? What a lovely surprise! I didn't know your folks were home. - How are you, Brigadier? - Dear Brigadier... Hi. Actually I was just passing by. I felt it was my duty to say hello to Maria. Why don't you come tomorrow to have spaghetti with us? - Actually I am... busy. - What a shame! - At the Capodichino airport. - Why? Who is arriving? A very famous man and I must escort him. Maybe it's the usual television host! - It isn't. - Who is it? Actually I cannot say. Alright. It doesn't matter. We are friends. - He is a rich billionaire. - A rich billionaire! They're afraid he'll be kidnapped, so they are sending me. If you're there, they won't show up. - What is his name? - Polpetti. - What time is he arriving? - At 11:44. - At 11:44. - At Capodichino. Get out of the car with your hands up! Get out! Hands up! Come on, you! Get Polpetti! Hurry. Slit the tires! Let's go! Hurry! - Hurry. We must follow them. - The tires are flat. Change them, idiot! We need a car. Stop! Stop! I was expecting it. Please, come in. - Finally you learned. - Yes. - See? I don't complain anymore. - Good. Keep it up. - It's destiny. - To each his own destiny. Who left the boat on the road? The van sped off! You can go. You are free. What? It can't be! With a car that's still new? It doesn't even have a scratch! No, there's a little stain. But... I'll go call the body shop guy. Good evening. Regarding the kidnapping of the king of rubber, the American billionaire, Polpetti, that took place yesterday, the kidnappers requested a 10 billion lira ransom in 5 and 10 lira coins. Polpetti's grandson and heir said that he won't pay. He also threatened an embargo of rubber to all of Europe if the bandits persist with their request. Panic has spread throughout, and Kissinger is already on his way. Some countries have put out some provisions. Cars will travel with three tires. Women and transvestites will no longer be able to use rubber breasts. It will be forbidden to chew gum on holidays. The investigation has been assigned to the Italian police.

Televisions and radio is talking about him. Why did you bring him here? I could kill you! Enough! Stop speaking. Could I say no to the Pera brothers? - They would have killed us all. - Keep calm. Keep calm! - Darn you! - Stop with those hands. According to the Pera brothers, the police won't look for him here. The police goes to real criminals and this is a house of jerks! Dad!

"Meatball" is burning. Send firemen to take it off the burner. Otherwise, the meatball and potatoes will end up on the grill! What are you saying? Potatoes? Meatball? Brigadier Petralia found everything out! Alright. We'll take care of it. Judas! Judas! Brigadier Petralia, this is for you. "Polpetti and Maria's family are our prisoners." "If you want to see them again, come to us. Pera Brothers." There is a gift too, Brigadier. Chief, Inspector Bond from New York is here. - No! Let him in! - Inspector? How are you? - Come with me. - I am glad to see you. Sit down. Why does a big FBI man come to visit a modest public security chief? Listen, Bond, what brings you to Italy? - Nobody brings me. - I see! I brought you a gift. - What happened? - Don't worry. Cuttlefish alarm. It's legal. - Chief! What happened? - Cuttlefish alarm system. - Who is he? - My collaborator, Brigadier Petralia. - Collaborator, very good! - What the... - I'll show you the gift. - It doesn't matter! Yes. Hen from an atomic raising farm. Catch the hen! Like it? Did you like the gift? Very good, Chief! - Very good, Petralia! - But... You let Polpetti get away, huh? Don't worry. The knife always slips out when it shouldn't. Petralia, let me embrace you! My dear Petralia! This is why I came. The FBI entrusted you with finding the billionaire. Oh, no! He must disappear forever. That is why his family pays me. It is very worried. - Worried? - That he could come back. It doesn't trust Italian kidnappers. They'll be overtaken by emotion and will free the old man without the ransom. It's not right. - What do you mean by that? - Dear friend Pappacoda, I have an assignment to carry out on behalf of his grandson. A secret operation that in code is called "Eye for an eye, ear for an ear". Understand? I'm sorry, dear Bond, but we must find him and send him to America whole. Great friend! I gave you the hen to eat. I have to earn my food too. If the chief allows me to say it, I know where he is. What? You knew and didn't tell me? - I didn't know. - Now you know. Yes, the Pera brothers have him. You are fixed on the Pera brothers! I am not fixed. They're waiting for me tonight to kill me. - I saw the wreaths. They're lovely. - Who told you? - Judas, their trusted man. - Go away or I'll wring your neck! - The hen's? - No, yours! Leave! - It's the truth. - Leave! It's the truth! The Pera brothers will kill me! - Go away! - It's the truth! That Brigadier Petralia seems sincere. Tell me something. Brigadier Petralia! When you come inside, the sun begins to shine. Sit down. You are a ray of light. Bravo! You discovered everything. But... The game is over! You played the ace up your sleeve like this! The children too? The whole family? What do you want to do to this family? After your death, they'll take a nice trip to comfort the poor widow. The widow? You are murderers! You can't do it! Enough! Guys, have fun! Help! Excuse me! Go on. Have fun, guys. You want war? So be it! I'll take care of it! What are you doing? Hold still! Are you crazy? I am your boss! What are you doing? Scoundrels! What are you doing? I am Pascalone Pera! I'll screw you now. Enough... Here I am! Let's get him! Get him. There he is! Immediately! - Stop! Stop! - Run! Stop! Stop! I am Pascalone Pera! You must get him, idiots! Here they are! Get in line! Charge! On the ground! Everyone freeze! Hands up! Brigadier Petralia! But... What an omelet, Chief! Brigadier Petralia! Chief, there's a misunderstanding. Brigadier Petralia! Marshal Petralia, the Notargate case is yours!
