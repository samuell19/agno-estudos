A Shochiku Film Kimi no Na wa Always in My Heart Cast KEIJI SADA KEIKO KISHI CHIKAGE AWASHIMA YUMEJI TSUKIOKA YUJI KAWAKITA TOSHIKO KOBAYASHI HITOMI NOZOE KEIKO AWAJI Hideo Oba Late Autumn Miss? Is anything wrong? Are you seasick? Yes. The crossing was really rough today. Is this your first time to Sado Island? No... Aren't you Machiko? Machiko Ujiie? So it is you. Remember me? I'm Aya Ishikawa of Hisagoya. Of course. You used to pass our inn when you were going to high school. I watched for you. I had a crush on you. Are you coming from Tokyo? Were you crying? I've been watching you. I was afraid you were going to jump in. You must be sad about something. I can tell. Although you're headed for Sado, you keep looking back from where you came. Your heart is still back there. Did you break up with your lover? Or did he die... in the war? What then? I'm more interested in others than myself. Why don't you tell me? Heartache is like sea sickness. You'll feel better if you get it all out. It was on May 24th, six months ago... the night of the air raid. That was when I met him. Watch out! Thank you. Not at all. Now's our chance. Watch out! It's a miracle I'm still alive. Thousands of people may have died last night. I, too, understand how precious life is for the first time in my life. Thanks to you. No, maybe because of you... I'm still alive. I'll never forget this night. - Where do you live? - Yotsuya. Then maybe that air raid last night... Then you must hurry home. Go. Quickly now. - Thank you so much. - Not at all. Oh... I don't know how long this war will last, but if we both survive, I'd like to see you again to remember this. If in six months, we're still alive let's plan to meet here on the night of November 24th. Yes, lets... if we're still alive. On November 24th then. Eight o'clock at night. Yes, I will definitely come. Great. Until then, stay safe. You, too. Hey. I forgot the most important thing. What is your name? I'm... Another air raid! Go quickly now. I'll be here, six months from now. Let's not tell each other our names until then. Good bye. Take care. So today is the day. Yes. Then why didn't you go? My uncle wouldn't let me. He closed his busy business to come get me from Sado. He said he couldn't wait two days for a pipe dream. He forced me to leave. But, if he is still alive he may be waiting for me at Sukiya Bridge. I feel so badly about that. But when you think about it, it's a silly promise. You just met him once, you know nothing about him. But I know how you feel. That man feels like the most precious person in your life. Machiko, what are you doing? Get your things together. Everyone knows where Hisagoya is. So if you feel lonely, feel free to come by. Machiko? Maybe he's waiting for you at Sukiya Bridge right now. Hey, Brother? Want a good time? Damn, stingy bastard. Brother? They're such a problem. They just keep coming. You've been here a long time. Are you looking for someone? Yes. I promised to meet a woman here tonight. After I'm gone, if a likely girl shows up, could you give her this? What's her name? Her name is... I don't know. We just promised to meet here six months ago. That's a problem. Not even a lead. Haruki Atomiya Editorial Dept, Freedom Club "Lovely girl, I do not know your name," "Are you happy?" "I wait on the bridge in the night mist" "as the night deepens the neon blink sadly." "Only you can make it merry." Kozue. Kozue, are you all right? Kozue? What's the matter? You're the man at the bridge. She's my friend. She got pregnant and tried to kill herself. Can you help me? I don't want the cops to find her. Where do you live? Just over there. Uncle Kaseda, could you come? What's the matter? Is Kozue worse? No, she's up. She says she's going out to work. What? Kozue, are you really going to work? You can't. What if you get sick? It doesn't matter if I think I already died that night. Do you really want to die? Fool! Okay, die then. If that's what you want. I will. I'm going to die. I'll take a lot of johns and die. Die! I will. Satisfied? Hey, Kozue! Kozue? When we met that night at Sukiya Bridge, you were the one who told me to die. I... I hated military men. But you saved me when I was starving to death. My feeling now is the same as yours then. I don't like women who do what you do. I hate them! But I can't just watch you die. Oh, it's you. Thanks for your help. Not at all. What's wrong? She insists on going to work. So I was admonishing her. Sit down. Asa? Why would you do such a thing? Kozue. Even Mr. Atomiya would scold you if you said you're going to work in your condition. But I want to die. Don't you see? I'd rather die than have a blue-eyed baby. Everyone would look down on me. Just ignore them. I'll say the baby is mine. How's that? You may feel bad, but it's not the baby's fault. That's right. Right, Kozue? So don't worry about the baby and rest. He's right. I can earn enough to feed you. I'm pretty popular you know. He's the only one who refused me. Oh, dear. I'm not too happy about Asa working either. I wish she wouldn't. I'll really work hard collecting wood so we all can make an honest living. I agree with Mr. Kaseda. I know it's hard for you. Especially for Kozue, now that she's pregnant. But don't give up. Don't give in to despair. You had no choice until now. But from now as Mr. Kaseda said, stop doing what you're doing and make an honest living. If you really want to, I'm sure it will happen. You have Mr. Kaseda on your side. And I'll help as much as I can. Okay? Poor things. That these blameless girls... are thrust into desperate lives... If there hadn't been a war... It's all the military's fault. I want to help these girls at all costs. I'm asking you to help, Mr. Atomiya. Please help them. Of course I will. I did not answer the person who asked my name and the years went by. I think of him as I stand on the hills of my home town, but Tokyo is far from Sado where spring is in full bloom. We're one of the wealthiest families on Sado. And he works for the municipality of Tokyo. He'll soon make section chief although he's still young. Don't you think he's a great match for you? That's why I brought you all the way back to Sado. Then your late parents can rest in peace. I hope you're still not thinking about the man you met at Sukiya Bridge. How idiotic... to make a young girl he met only once promise such a thing He must be a delinquent Uncle, don't speak badly of him. What? Then you won't do as I say? Why are you so high-handed? Silence. I'm acting as your parent. If you can't do as I say, get out. I wash my hands of you. Are you really like that, Uncle? ...an old fashioned, obstinate man? What? It's because you're so stubborn. In any case, Katsunori will be home on vacation soon. We've already told his family we agree. So it's settled. I won't tolerate willfulness ...from either of you! Hey, do just stand there. Go buy some supplies. Idiot! Machiko, well said. You're the first one who stood up to Uncle. You did what I couldn't all these years. It made my heart glad. And I understand how you feel. Unlike your uncle. I don't think the man is a delinquent and I can see how you can't forget him. However, Machiko... no matter what kind of a man he is if you don't know his name or where he is it's like catching a cloud. And does he still remember you? So even if you don't want to right now, I think it's better for you if you married Katsunori as Uncle says. I won't force you. But when I married your uncle I didn't love him either. Aunt? And did you find your life worth living? Having to lead a life of endurance, are you really happy? I never thought about it. But I'm healthy and we're relatively well-off so this must be a good life. Although your uncle is a stubborn man, he's not a bad man. How you think about things will change your outlook. If you think this is your fate, you can be happy. Miss, someone's here to see you. She said, tell her Aya is here. Oh, yes. Hello. Aya. Machiko. How are you? I have news... about the man you met at Sukiya Bridge. Come to my house at once. You'll find out there. Come, now. Here she is. This is Machiko Ujiie. This is the man who found him. I'm Sadahiko Honma. I dabble in literature. He's a poet. Remember I showed you his poem? "Sado in the bosom of spring..." Something like that. Please. I was deeply moved when Aya told me about you. Because you have a pure spirit, very unusual nowadays. Not just your spirit, you're beautiful as well. Don't flatter her. Go ahead and show her that book. Wait a second. I was so moved, I thought I'd write a poem about it. Then quite coincidentally... I read this magazine called Freedom Club. And I happened across the man you met. This is it. This is the poem. The person who wrote this poem is the person you're looking for. The theme matches your story exactly. I'll read it. "Traces of You." "On a winter night," "on the banks of Sukiya Bridge," "I see the traces of a beautiful girl" "in the white mist." "It's the glimmer of a lovely person" "whom I fled hand in hand." "The city engulfed in flames while the sirens blared." "Who are you, the one whose name I do not know." "I call but you do not come." "Sadness as the city lights fade in the night mist." Well? It's an amateurish poem, but his feelings are well expressed. It matches your story exactly. That's right. It must be him. Haruki Atomiya. His name's right there. Miss. I found this poem by accident. But this isn't just a coincidence. It's a sign that you two were meant to be together. He's so excited as though it was about himself. Of course I am. In this ugly world after Japan lost the war, my heart longs for things that are beautiful. Whether it's a flower, a bird or about someone else, it makes my heart full. Will you leave it to me? Your fate? We know his name but not where he lives. That's easy. We just ask the magazine. I see. Hey, Editor. What is this article? "The Grey Spirit." "A beautiful flower blooms in the site of confusion." It reads like an instruction article for young ladies. I'm all for integrity in editorial policy. But look what New World Magazine does with it using the same material. "The bizarre lives of" "a former army officer and two prostitutes" "living in huts in the burned out ruins." So erotic! But that story is not true. Those girls were at one time prostitutes. But I got them work in a laundry and they're trying to rehabilitate their lives. I don't care about facts. But our magazine is not a textbook for ethics. We need readers. Thrills and erotica. I'm warning you. If we're in the red again this month, I'm going to withdraw my support. Think about that. How did the photo our magazine took get into New World? - You were the only one... - I'll look into it. Thrill and erotica, is it? His name is Yokoyama, he was my staff officer. I don't know how he found out where I was, but he came to visit me out of the blue. After the war, I sold off some things and bought a lot of paper. And now I own a magazine called New World. Yesterday, this photo came into my possession. This photo... I bribed the Freedom Club photographer. I was surprised to see you in the photo. Since you were in the photo I didn't see why Freedom Club should have an exclusive. Sir, give me a story, for old time sake. But, Yokoyama, Mr. Atomiya of the Freedom Club already... No. I'm going to scoop them. It's the same with war or business. A surprise attack. Sir? During the war we both persecuted conscripted soldiers... In other words, this country's citizens. We're both war criminals. Let's protect each other. Yokoyama, leave! Don't get mad. If you want me to go, I will, but I got the story from the photographer. So we'll write the article on our own, but here's a small honorarium. It looks like you're in dire straits. Excuse me. Hey, I don't want this. Take it back. Hey, Yokoya ma! Wait! Hey, you. Yokoya ma! Yokoya ma! I clearly said no. I returned the money. Yet he wrote this irresponsible article. I apologize to you and the girls. It was my fault. Forgive me. No, it's all right. I don't intend to stay at the magazine. You're quitting? And then what? Won't you be hard up? Maybe. But I'll get by. If I can't make it in Tokyo, I'll go home. You mean back to Tuba? Yes. I should go see my older sister. It'll be lonely if you go. I'm sorry this happened because of me. It's not your fault, Mr. Kaseda. The whole world has turned ugly. How's the laundry working out? Do you think you can work there? Yes. At first some looked at us like we were dirt, but we're willing to bear it. That's good. I'm relieved. I was worried that this awful article had made you dejected. I don't care how many lies they write about us. That's right. We have you and Uncle on our side. We're okay. Kozue, the fire's going. Could you stay? We'll make you something good. How good the wind feels. Atomiya, I just don't understand this world. Why is virtue out of fashion? I believed in a virtuous world and decided to start from scratch. But goodwill will only get you so far. Only the bad succeed. That's not true. I also believe that virtue will win. There's no point in living if you don't. It will win in the end. I want to believe that. For their sake, too. Kozue, a shooting star. Summer's here. I come alone to the mountain not knowing her name and ask the Hamahiru River. What happened to Machiko? Don't just sit there. Machiko's in trouble. What? She's not there. She's out on a date to Mt. Kinpoku with Hamaguchi, the guy who's home from Tokyo. Hamaguchi? The guy who proposed to Machiko. So it's true that her uncle is trying to marry her off. That's right. Why don't we go to Mt. Kinpoku to see? Unlike your uncle I have no intention of coercing you into marrying me anytime soon. But even if you have no intention of marrying right now, if I know that you have some feelings for me, I'll have something to look forward to even if I go back to Tokyo and my work. That's all I want from you now. So please, think about it. Let's take a walk. Machiko! - Who are they? - My friends. Machiko, we looked for you everywhere. - What is it? - It's about that letter. It was returned. The magazine Freedom Club went bankrupt. But don't despair. We know his name. Machiko, is that him? This Hamaguchi? Did you tell him the truth? No. Why not? You should brush him off. Do you want me to? But he's kinda cute. Aya is a funny girl. She told me a lot about you. About where you heart is... your romance. You're a beautiful person. You've kept your war memories alive. Machiko. Won't you come to Tokyo with me? Come, and look for that person. I'll help you search. If you meet him again and he's a good person, I'll go away. I like you so I want to help you. But pretend that you've agreed to your uncle. I think that's better for you and easier for me to take you to Tokyo. Machiko? Please trust me. Are you going to take all these books with you? Why don't you let us keep them for you? All right. That's settled then. It'll be too heavy to take. We'll read the books and study, right Kozue? You're going to be back real soon, right? I don't know. Depends if I find another job in Tokyo. Until then, I don't know. But you have to be back before that day. December 24th. No, you mean November 24th. Oh, that's right. December is Christmas. You're going to Sukiya Bridge, aren't you? Yes, maybe. No, I'll go. You poor thing. You can't see the person you love. But why did you say goodbye without asking her name? You're a fool. Don't go anymore. She won't come. She didn't come on May 24th either. No, I think he should go. I'm sure she'll come this time. I have a feeling. But if she does, she'll take him away from us. That can't be helped. But when you come back, come to us first. We'll be waiting. Yes, I'll come. The next time we meet, you'll have a baby. Take care of yourself. You don't have to worry about us. We'll do our best even without you. Great. I'll pray for your happiness. Don't cry, Kozue. She's so funny. Arrive Tomorrow Seven A.M. Haruki. It was my fault. I hate my indecisiveness. I think it was the beginning of summer when the Nishizaki family decided to divorce Yukie. But they did it in such an awful way. Mr. Mizusawa, if you won't be flexible the discussion will escalate into a fight. Yukie is still young. We are all thinking of what's best for Yukie. But during the war, when labor was scarce, you made her stay saying she was a war widow, but now you decide to throw her out. If Yukie leaves here, she has nowhere to go. She'll be destitute. What's your relationship with Yukie? Who are you to Yukie? You worry about her being destitute, but weren't you the one who was waiting for Yukie to leave this family, isn't that so, Mr. Mizusawa? You may think we don't know, but everyone in this town knows you've been friendly with Yukie. So you should make sure she's not out in the cold. How rude. What proof do you have? If you get emotional, we can't discuss this. Kengo, don't say anything more. Why don't you go now? I was disgusted by my cowardice. That's when it happened. Professor Mizusawa. Where were you? - It was city hall business. - Liar. You went to see Yukie. You can't hide it. I've seen you two talking alone many times. Why don't we take a walk along the beach? - I still have things to do. - Just for a bit. Please, let's go I know a place where the sea lilies grow. Let's go. She was Nami Tomura, a shell diver, and she had shown inordinate interest in me. See all these lilies? I always come here and think of you. I love you. Please marry me. - Miss Tomura, I'm leaving. - Wait. Do your really love Yukie that much? Yukie is married. Who knows what people will say. So, fall in love with me instead. I love you. That's all. If you marry me, you can do anything. - I won't blame you. - Let me go. - I won't. - Fool! - What's the matter? - Professor. There was a shell where I fell. It hurt. Get up. I'll help you. No, you don't have to get me up. This is just fine. See? The moon is beautiful. Professor! Professor. I love you. I'm ashamed to say. I finally gave in to Nami that night. After that, Yukie went to Hamashima. She started working at a restaurant, Matsuki. I was worried, Sister, that you were in despair. Sister, don't lose hope. No matter how hard it is, we have to go on. Everyone is suffering. But eventually things will get better. Haruki, Don't worry about me. I'm used to unhappiness. The party will be over soon, so we'll have a long talk tonight. It's been too long. You must think I put on too much makeup. Machiko. Don't despair. We know he went back to Tuba. Why don't we go to Tuba? My summer vacation is coming up. If you'd like, I'll go with you. No, I can't cause you more bother. It's okay. We've come this far. And now when I know there's a chance, I'm afraid to see him. Isn't it funny? Chin up, Machiko. I'm trying the best that I can, too. If you're like that, what am I to do? So why don't we go? Where is the community center? Who at the center do you want to see? Mr. Kengo Mizusawa. What do you want? We're looking for someone. I was hoping Mr. Mizusawa would know where he is. Who? Is it Mr. Atomiya? He went back to Tokyo yesterday. But his sister is here. She works at a Hamashima restaurant. He said he could be contacted there. He's publishing a new magazine with a friend's help. If you had come one day earlier... I see. That's too bad. I can't believe you came all this way. That you care so much to come all the way here. I thank you for him. My brother would be happy if he knew. Please. Here. But Mr. Hamaguchi... That is your name? Pardon me for asking, but if Machiko met my brother and he is the man at the bridge... No, I know he must be... and if my brother is also waiting for Machiko, what are you going to do? I really haven't... Thought about it? - No. - I see. But you're supporting Machiko in her quest to find my brother. Then that time must come. - Yes. - Then? Then I'll go. That's the promise. I'm sorry for you. For me, Machiko's happiness is everything. I see. Machiko, you're a lucky girl. To have someone like him supporting you. I envy you. Machiko, shall we take a walk? I want to talk to you alone. Is that all right, Mr. Hamaguchi? Machiko, what are your feelings about Mr. Hamaguchi? I think he's a good person. When I think about him, I wonder what I should do. I see. Then, all the more, you shouldn't lose him. Machiko, I love Haruki. He's my brother after all. But Haruki is a man. I don't trust men even my own brother. As a man, how does Haruki feel about women? I'm sorry, Machiko. Shall I tell you the truth? I think Mr. Hamaguchi is a good, kind person. But I wonder what he's really thinking. I don't want to trust any man at all. You sound so unhappy. Yes. Since I've led an unhappy life, I've come to feel that way. Machiko? I want you to be happy. What's the matter? Can't you sleep? Mr. Hamaguchi, I want to talk to you. As my uncle wished, I will marry you. I want to marry you and have a happy life. Machiko. Why, all of a sudden? You haven't even seen Atomiya yet. I've decided not to see him. I think... I think it's best if I don't see him. - Machiko. Did the sister... - No. I don't know why myself. I'm afraid. I'm afraid to hope for a happier life. If I see him, what happens next? If I fall in love with him... It's so scary. But isn't that why you've been looking for him? Now that you finally know... It's enough that I know. After I met his sister and knew for certain he was the one I was looking for. Just like his sister said, I thought about you... how you brought me from Sado to Tokyo then from Tokyo to this faraway place. About you, your kindness... Machiko. You're pitying me. The last thing I want from anyone is pity. Katsunori, why in the world would I pity you? Please make sure I won't go anyplace else, that I won't keep dreaming. Machiko. Do you really mean that? Machiko? If that's how you really feel, I'll... Machiko! I'll love you more than anyone. Your name... What is your name? What's the matter? I'm happy. Aya, I am weak. I finally promised to marry Hamaguchi, despite the fact that I was so desperate not being able to see him. Once I knew where he was I couldn't bear the weight of my dream. I want to live an ordinary life and forget him. I think I can... no, I will forget him. Well? Do you understand? In a way... how Machiko feels. You're a poet after all. Well I don't. Now that she's finally found him she decides before meeting him. She's a fool. She won't be able to forget him. It's her first love. Uncle Kaseda bought all these. He paid for the birth. Uncle seems to have a lot of money recently. I can't believe he makes that much collecting wood. Maybe he's dabbling in the black market. No way! He hates that kind of thing most of all. But he's acting very strangely. Sometimes he's absent for days at a time. He didn't come home last night, either I wouldn't worry. He's a good man. Shall I ask him? Please. He's so cute. I hoped he'd look like anyone else, but he has lire eyes. But I'm going to raise him. What did you name him? Don't get angry. I took a part of your name. I named him Toshiki. Uncle thought it was okay. I'm sorry. That's all right. You're Toshiki? But I'm sorry he doesn't have a father. Brother Atomiya? What? What is it? What's the matter? No, it's nothing. I'm stupid. I just thought how happy he would be if you were his father. It just crossed my mind. I'm sorry. A woman like me hoping for so much. I bet the gods will strike me down. Kozue. You shouldn't put yourself down. You shouldn't make yourself miserable. If you have feelings for me... I'm happy. I thank you. Brother Atomiya. But, Kozue... I'm... I know. It's the women at Sukiya Bridge. It's you... It's been a long time... I'm Makiko Ujiie. I'm Haraki Atomiya. It's so good to see you again. So you were safe. You, too. I... I waited for you for a long time. It was worth the wait. It was just about this time, that night, that the B-29 planes kept flying overhead. You were trembling. I came last year, this May and waited. I waited for you, the girl I only knew for a single night while running from the air raid. I may be stupid, but I kept waiting. I staked my whole life on that night's promise. Haruki, I wanted to see you, too. And to hear now you were waiting for me with the same feeling. Were you in Tokyo all this time? Tell me your story tonight. Haruki, I'm getting married tomorrow. I see. You're getting married. After we parted, I couldn't see you on either the six month OI' one year anniversary. And now that I'm finally able to see you, it's good bye. Haruki, I didn't intend to see you again. But before I got married, I wanted to see this special bridge one more time. And if... if you were here, I wanted to get a glimpse of you. Thank you. I'm glad you came. I hope you'll be very happy. Haruki, perhaps you're already married? Goodbye, then. "You who cast me aside and left me." "Are you happy? "You who stood "on the bridge shrouded in the night mist, "There were tears on your eyelashes. And then... "There were tears on your eyelashes. "There were tears on your eyelashes. Years passed... "There were tears on your eyelashes. "There were tears on your eyelashes. "Oh my life would only be happy "Oh my life would only be happy" "if you were in it." What are you thinking? This must be Sukiya Bridge. You sound like a country bumpkin. I am. I can't help it. So what about Sukiya Bridge? It's full of sad memories. A young man and woman, who didn't know each others names promised to meet here then parted. They had spent a night together during an air raid. The man fell in love and wrote a poem. "On a winter night, on Sukiya Bridge "shrouded by a, white mist "I see traces of her." See? And the woman? Of course she loved him, too, and tried to find him. They finally met after a year and a half on this bridge. But it's so absurd. When they finally met, the girl was already engaged. What a sad tale. Oh, it's your unrequited love story, Aya. Not me, I'm not that stupid. Let's go. Excuse me, isn't this boy yours? No, is he lost? Yes. I don't know what to do. Poor boy. Were you with your mom? Oh, this child's mixed race. Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - So he's your kid? - I'm sorry. If you're his mom, keep an eye on him. She must be irresponsible, if she had a child like that. Public welfare for children of mixed race only spoils them. There's something wrong with women who give birth to mixed race children. They don't have any virtue or pride. You're right. I want your department to be more strict in your crack down policies. Yes, very definitive ones. But as fellow Japanese who experienced the hardships of war, I wonder if it's wise to blame the women and these children. We should approach them with compassion... Stop being so virtuous, Atomiya. You should look at reality more objectively. Do you want Japan to become a colony? Don't you worry about the purity of our race? You say the purity of race, but aren't Japanese a mixed breed anyway? Hey, hey. I object. I'm surprised that the editor of the municipal magazine holds such beliefs. But facts are facts. Perhaps you are of mixed race but I'm a purebred Japanese. At least in the spiritual sense. I agree. You mustn't forget that pride. Thank you. Thank you. I might use your private room for magazine business from time to time. I hope you don't mind. We'd be happy to. Excuse me, your name is Atomiya...? Yes. Are you Haruki Atomiya? That's right. I'm Haruki. Oh, then my hunch was right. So you are him. Then you must know Machiko Ujiie. I'm from Sado. I'm Machiko's best friend. I'm apprenticing here, because I want to open a restaurant in Tokyo. Mr. Atomiya, Machiko loved you so much... that's why I know your name. I wonder. Don't you believe me? Men believe that only women who will many them or are going steady with them love them. But in my case... Machiko is married to someone else. But because she loved you so much, Machiko left you. Machiko is a coward. That's why she married someone she didn't love. It's true. And, are you married? - No. - Still single? Yes. You can't forget Machiko? You can't deny it, can you? You were very vocal in that discussion, but in matters like this, you can't say how you feel. Don't make fun of me. Thank you. Here's the bill. Mr. Atomiya, can I pay you a visit? Of course. About what? I want to tell you about Machiko. Why would I want to hear about a married woman? I will pay you a visit. Machiko, how are you? I'm writing this tonight for I have special news. I met him at the restaurant tonight. Your Haruki Atomiya. Niigata Machiko? Are you and Aya still close? I saw she wrote you yesterday. Not especially. That's all right, then. Machiko? I told you once before. Being a municipal worker, I have to be careful. When we're in Tokyo and you associate with her my superiors and their wives will gossip. They'll say you have a friend n the entertainment business. And that affects my career. But she's not a bad person. People judge just by appearances. Machiko. I see Atomiya works in the PR department in the main office. I took the liberty of reading this. How strange fate is. When I'm transferred to the main office I'll see him every day. You may have to see him, too. What shall we do? What's that to do with me? I don't have anything to do with him anymore. Then is it because I'm insecure? Machiko. You're still here, Katsunori? Isn't today you last day at work here? It's important to make an effort till the very end. Don't be late. Machiko, the honeymoon's over. Oh, your tie is crooked. Do I have to do everything? Machiko, his shoes. Have a good day. Tokyo They want the discussion article pulled? The new section chief ordered it. - The reason? - We're not sure. Excuse me. I'm Atomiya from editorial. I was on a business trip, so I haven't had the chance to welcome you. So you're Atomiya. I'm Hamaguchi. Nice to meet you. Have a seat. I see the magazine has a wide circulation. It must be hard, with such a small budget. Mr. Atomiya, you've heard? I want the discussion article removed. Yes, but it's an important... That's why I have a problem with it. The problems of prostitutes and mixed-race kids. Those are problems we can't do anything about. So it's better not to mention them. The government shouldn't stir up controversy Let sleeping dogs lie. We're still under occupation. We don't know what the future will bring. You may be dissatisfied but I would appreciate your cooperation. Then please replace the article right now. Yes, I understand. - Machiko? - Yes? Do you really love me? Do you love only me? What a question. Are you drunk already? Then you've forgotten about him entirely? I'm talking about Atomiya. How many times must I swear to you? It's been two years since then. But I can't believe it. Is love really like that? A feeling you can forget and give up so easily? I want to make sure. Our happiness mustn't be destroyed by others. If you leave it alone, I would forget. Yet you keep stirring it up. Aren't you happy that I do? I met him at the office today. I met Atomiya. How unusual for you to drink. Machiko, where're the tickets? I hear we're going to see Kabuki. We were invited by the bureau chief's wife. It's great that she's taken you under her wing. You have to work hard. Patronage is everything in government work. Machiko, the kitchen's not cleaned up yet. Right away. I haven't seen Kabuki in years? Japan's slowly getting back to normal. It's good to be alive. What's the matter? It's nothing. Are you feeling ill? Why don't you go out into the foyer? Someone wants to see you. I didn't know you'd be here. Today's screening is for magazine writers. I see. I want you to see someone. Atomiya. This is my wife. Her name is Machiko. I believe you know her. I knew about you since Machiko has spoken about you... even before we got married. It's a strange fate that we're working in the same office. You probably haven't seen each other for a while. Why don't you two talk? It's nice to see you again. I'm happy you look well. You look well, too, Haruki. Did something happen? Why did your husband bring us together? I think it was better if we didn't meet. Don't you have to go back inside? Please do. I feel I'm causing you trouble. That's not true. What's wrong? Nothing. I'll go now. What were you doing? You're being extremely rude. Welcome home. You have a visitor. Who is it? A woman. She's so pushy. I told her you were out, but she just pushed her way in. Welcome home. - Oh, it's you. - I said I would come. Your landlady is so rude. She said I'm not welcome. She said that? Your room was so messy I was tidying up. I'll come from time to time to clean. Sit down. Thank you. Relax. This is your home. Did you know Machiko's in Tokyo? It's so annoying. Hamaguchi doesn't like her seeing me. He wrote to tell me not to visit. Who does he think I am? Do I look like such a bad woman? I'm so misunderstood. Do you think so, too? - No. - Really? That's good then. But I really want to see Machiko. I... met her. Tonight. At the Kabuki Theater. She was with her husband. Really? And was Machiko well? Yes. Was she happy? Yes. Really? Mr. Atomiya? Asa is here. Will you excuse me? Why are you here this late? - Brother Atomiya... - Come in. Did you see the evening papers? - No. - Then you don't know? Uncle Kaseda is in big trouble. The police have him. Look. Uncle wouldn't do something like this. He must have been tricked. Kozue was summoned to the station, too. As a person of interest. They were asking about you, too. Maybe they'll summon you, too. I see. Smuggling Ring Arrested Head is former army officer Smuggling Ring Leader Former Officer Kaseda Charged New Details in Smuggling Ring Duped by Subordinate Come in. You called? It wasn't very important... - but too bad for you. - Excuse me? About the smuggling ring. I hear your friend is involved. Yes. That's not good. I'm very sorry. I know you don't have anything to do with it. Even if the higher-ups complain to me, I intend to deflect it. So what are they saying? Nothing specific. But the higher-ups seem to know about it. So how about it, just as a formality, can you submit an unofficial resignation? I'll take care of the rest. Since this is a government office. If we don't observe the formalities, it may get complicated later. I see. So you will? Well... I'll think about it. If I were to submit, it will be an actual resignation. Atomiya, what do you mean? No, not over this, but I was thinking of resigning for personal reasons. Aren't you being emotional? Not at all. I thought about it very objectively and I think that's what I should do. Atomiya, you're talking about Machiko? Don't get me wrong. I'm not the type to bring personal matters into my job. I don't think I'm obsessing on your past relationship. No, even if you did, I don't blame you. We're human after all. Excuse me. I tried my best to placate the bosses as well. But Atomiya became too emotional. He insisted on quitting. I'm in a bind. It can't be helped. It's not your fault. But I wish... What? Before you asked for his unofficial resignation, why didn't you quash it yourself? If you did, I would have thought you admirable. I'm sorry you didn't. You're saying what I did wasn't admirable? I didn't mean that. I don't want people to think you were unfair. Unfair? What did I do that was unfair? You want to say I drove Atomiya into resigning. You want to protect him that much? - No. That's not... - No, I know. - He's more precious to you. - Dear... Why do you say that? There's nothing between us. Don't lie. You haven't forgotten him. I saw it in your eyes when you saw him at the theater. Dear, why won't you believe me? I said what I said just now because objectively, it's an unfortunate situation. To lose one's job is to lose one's livelihood. And if even a tiny bit of that has to do with me then I couldn't apologize enough. Then I will never be able to forget him. Because I really want to think of him as a total stranger. Why are you shouting? You haven't taken a bath. What are you talking about? If it's of interest, I want to hear, too. What's it about? Why are you both silent? Katsunori. What were you talking about? It's nothing. It's about Machiko's former lover. Dear! You saw him at the theater me other day. Katsunori, why don't you take a bath? Shall I wash your back? He's late. He should be home soon. He's out with a friend who came to visit from Hokkaido. It's my day off, so I'll wait. Oh, Machiko. Aya. I have to see him and apologize. All this trouble, because of me. I see. I thought it was strange. Since I heard he quit so suddenly. So that's what happened. And that's why you're here. Use the cushion. But is that all, Machiko? You burst into tears when you saw me. Is something else bothering you? No... That's all right then. Look, Machiko, you don't have to hide it from me. Tell me the truth. Are you happy? It doesn't look like it. It was a mistake from the start. You can't have a successful marriage based on a lie. Machiko, do you know why Atomiya is still single? I think it's because he can't forget you. Machiko, now is the time... I'm kidding. Unlike me, you're refined and have good manners. You couldn't possible lake such a giant step. If you could you would have... Oh, he's home. Welcome home. Machiko's here. Why? Why? Because she wants to see you. Go up quickly. Missus, could we have some tea? Why are you here? I came to apologize. I don't think you owe me an apology. Let's don't forget the past. Everyone in Japan is beginning to forget about the war. We should forget what's in the past. Until now, I just couldn't forget you. But even if I have to make an effort, I intend to forget you. You should forget me, too. So you can find real happiness. Let's promise we'll both forget each other. So, you mustn't ever come here again. Let's become strangers. You should go now. Please leave. Machiko, what's wrong? Aya... Machiko! Machiko. Machiko? Where were you? Do you know someone who lives there? - No. - The house you visited... I know that a Mr. Atomiya from your past, lives on the second floor. Katsunori told me. He also alerted me, since you were acting strangely, I came on the off chance. Let's go home before it rains. Mother... Let's talk after we get home. Why did you have to go and apologize to mat man? You must think very little of me. You value his feelings over your husband's. No, I just... Machiko do you think it's all right to go see a man behind your husband and your mother-in-law's backs? That's so unfair to Katsunori. Katsunori was brought up properly. I worry about his future with someone like you. You're destroying my family. Mother, in the past I have done my best to make this family a happy one. I've worried and made great efforts to find ways to please you both. But you take everything I do the wrong way. You followed me today in secret. You don't trust me. That's because you do untrustworthy things. Machiko, do you think this can be a happy family when you're in love with another man? You don't admit your own faults and you make if our fault. Why are you making that face? Although you look kind, you're a frightful person. Dear, I want to talk to you... alone. If we talk alone everything will be fine. Look. I'm his mother. - You want me to leave? - No. If you think I'm in your way, I'll leave anytime. Yes, I'll leave. But I never imagined I'd hear those words from my son's wife. In this new age, a mother may be valueless but I brought my son up. Then to have his wife say I'm an intruder... Katsunori, is a mother's existence such a sad one? Machiko. Apologize to Mother. - Machiko! - No, I don't want an apology. I shouldn't have said anything. But Katsunori, I felt sorry for you, so that's why I did what I did. Machiko! Why won't you apologize? Dear? What did I do wrong? Why won't you trust me? I'm so disappointed. If you want me to trust you why don't you become a wife I can trust? Dear? What do you want me to do? How can I satisfy you? Please, tell me. You ask me that? Yes, please tell me. Don't be impertinent. Why don't you ask yourself that? When I say apologize, do as I say. Mother has done everything for me. Unlike you, I'm her only concern. Mother, make my bed. I'm going to bed. What a disgrace. You didn't have to marry her, knowing what you did. You could have married any girl you wanted. That vulgar woman. We have to consider your future and really think about her. You have an early morning? Then I'll say good night. Machiko! Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. Mr. Atomiya? - Mr. Atomiya. - Yes? A Mr. Hamaguchi is here to see you. Hamaguchi? He's very excited. Atomiya, is Machiko here? No. She's really not here? It's true. Has something happened to her? No, nothing. Then perhaps she's with friends. I'm sorry to disturb you this late at night. Please don't tell the office I came here. It's really nothing. Why would I? I don't work there anymore. That's right. Let's promise we'll forget each other. You must never come here again. Mr. Atomiya. The woman who was here the other day was standing outside. Is anything wrong? Are you ill? Yes, all of a sudden, I'm not feeling well. You got a chill. Why don't you rest over there? There's some time until the first train. Please. Come. Over here. Where are you going? I want to go to Sado. Sado? That's a long trip. Oblivion is to forget completely. My heartaches as I promise oblivion when I cannot forget. "Although they've parted" "she can't forget him" "on the long sea voyage." "Another's wife sheds tears of woe" "as she travels the sea to Sado." Poor thing. Machiko finally realized her mistake. Please go to Sado. I packed intending to go with you. Machiko's waiting for you. But if he knows she's gone to Sado, Hamaguchi will go to bring her back. Then, Atomiya, do you want Machiko, who's finally left him, to go back to that house? No matter what the reason, a divorce... You think that's bad? You're just trying to believe that. So you don't care how unhappy she is because she's married? So you've really wiped Machiko from your heart? You've forgotten her? Is that so? Then can I ask you a favor? Atomiya. It's not like me, but I've fallen for you. I don't know what to do. If you've really forgotten Machiko then can you fall in love with me instead? Don't you want to? You don't want to. Let's go then. To Sado. We can't leave poor Machiko there. Here. Nobue, tell Machiko to come here. Her husband's come all the way from Tokyo to get her. How rude. She says she doesn't want to see him anymore. What? Then does Machiko want a divorce? I suppose... Fool! Without a good reason, I won't let them divorce. In any case, get Machiko. I said get her. I think I should talk to her alone. I think there's a misunderstanding. If she's unreasonable, slap her. Women get uppity if you're kind to them. Machiko. What are you so unsatisfied with? Machiko. Do you want a divorce? Even if you do, I won't give you a divorce. Machiko, as long as Atomiya is in your heart, I will suffer. So I want you to suffer, too. I've always hated to lose, ever since I was a child. I won't lose to Atomiya. I won't lose to anyone concerning you. Machiko. Please be reasonable. I know Mother is hard on you. But if you have at least some affection for me that shouldn't be a problem In any case, I will never let you go. Remember that. I have to go to work, so I must return tomorrow. Machiko. Will you come home with me? Please, Machiko. Machiko. What's the matter? Machiko? Machiko. Machiko. Auntie... Machiko... Machiko, what's the matter? Machiko. Machiko. Auntie? What's wrong with her? Katsunori. Machiko's pregnant. She's carrying your baby. In any case, she can't go back with you today. We'll keep her here for a while. Machiko, take care of yourself. Come home as soon as you can. Auntie, please take care of her. You must be tired. Machiko. This must be so hard. I understand how you feel. When you came back, I knew you had good reason to. So, I thought it was better to get a divorce. But... you'll have to think about the child now. Women are such sad creatures. It's on the other side of that mountain. Machiko will be overjoyed to see you. Aya, I can't find her. I've been concerned about her. You've just arrived, but can you help me find her? But where did she go? She didn't leave a note. I don't think she'll do anything stupid, but she was really suffering. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko. Machiko! Machiko. Machiko. What are you trying to do? Cry. Cry all you want. Then... Promise me, you'll never do anything foolish like this again. I... I didn't want to die. While you were alive. I didn't... I didn't want to leave this world you are in. That would be too sad. I intended to divorce Hamaguchi. I vowed never to go back to that house again. That was my intention when I left. Machiko. If you want to leave him that much I'll never let anyone have you. I came here to get you. Haruki. What am I to do? I'm pregnant. When the child is born, and as long as it lives, Hamaguchi and I... Machiko. Haruki. What am I to do? Tell me? Machiko. You... Perhaps you should go back... to Hamaguchi. For the sake of the baby. We have to forget each other. Haruki. Machiko. You have to go home now. All right? The Next Day... Haruki left Sado with a broken heart.
