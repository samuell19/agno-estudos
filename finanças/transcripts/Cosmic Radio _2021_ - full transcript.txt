You know, Bobby, you are an absolute moron. There ain't a tree-hugger within miles of here. I know there's tree-huggers around here, man. I heard 'em talking about it. You're an idiot. Nothing but a waste of good, valuable drinking time. Come on, let's get back to the bar. The summer I turned 13, my mom traveled to India to find herself. I stayed behind to find the father I barely even knew. Shit! I sure hope I got the right person to do this. Seriously, dude, knock it off. She's tougher than she looks. She looks like she just came form the mall. It feels like we're putting a Barbie doll up there. It was the summer I met Rachael and Justin and the Free Earth Alliance. And the summer I almost died. And it all started at the bottom of a 100-foot tree that Rachael called Lilith. Gotta stay focused, Rachael. There's a lot riding on this. You're tuned to 95.3 KZMC, Cosmic Radio. And if you've been anywhere near downtown today, you know things are definitely heating up. The protestors are louder, the big timber company's growing more impatient, and tree-sitter Rachael Atwood, daughter of conservative Senator Charles Atwood, still hasn't said a word about her demands. A press release from her organization states only one thing, she has named her tree Lilith. And to think, a week ago, the big discussion in our sleepy little town was whether or not to put in a traffic light. Looks like we're in for a very long summer. Did you have a good vacation? I did, Howard, thanks, man. How's Shadow? She's doing good. All right, good to see you. Thank you, you too. Well, I see the programming department's hard at work, for once. Oh, the prodigal son returns! Nice vacation there, buddy, who was she? I see you haven't burned the place down yet, Marcus. Well, hello, your insurance isn't paid up yet. Cynical, man. Welcome home, Tyler. You're just in time for the bloody media circus. No shit. So the girl in the tree is really Atwood's daughter. Yeah, and the dude's giving up nothing, and there's no comment from Tree Girl, either. All the info we do get comes from that group of hers. What was it, Marcus, the FEA? Yes, it's the Free Earth Alliance. These cats are serious when it comes down to the environment. Oh yeah, real... Cosmic Radio. So what kind of mood's the princess in? Same as always, big kick in the balls. It's Friday afternoon on KZMC, Cosmic Radio. K.C. Nighthorse with you for one more hour. Tiffany Campbell's up next. Then we'll be turning it over to the one and only Tyler Stone, station manager and all-around peachy guy. He's back from vacation and, ladies, I have to tell you, he is looking so fine. You look like shit. Didn't you get any sleep while you were gone? Thanks a lot. It's good to see you, too. This stuff's gonna eat you alive. Water, Tyler, water. How was Frisco? It was all right. Yeah, what was her name? I had to get away from all the family business bullshit, you know? Uh oh, this doesn't' sound good. My dad and all his corporate Nazi partners have been sniffing around the books, no big deal. If you say so. I guess I'll go home and get a shower before my spot. Will I see you later? Maybe. Dakota and I are gonna do pizza and a movie. Girls night out. Dakota, my Dakota? What's she doing here? She didn't feel like traipsing around India with her mom and that step-father of hers, so they dropped her at your place. Shit. Jesus, Tyler, she is your daughter. How about spending some time with her? Now there's a novel concept. I just can't relate to the kid, you know? She's too... She's too mature? That's what scares you. She's 13 going on 38 and you're, what? 38 going on 12? You've got an opportunity here, don't blow it. Now that hurt. I'm on, get the hell out of here. You missed me, I can tell. You're tuned to California's only true music station, 95.3 KZMC, Cosmic Radio. Dakota. It's really good, Tyler, you should finish it. I didn't expect to see you til Christmas. Mom called but you were off on one of your things. K.C. said just bring me, so is that okay? Yeah, sure, it'll be great. Don't act so enthused. You're still drinking that nasty stuff? Death wish. Don't you ever get dressed? You're just like your mom. Now that was uncalled for. How's Pierre? He's an asshole. Dakota. He is! You know you can't stand him any more than I can. All that new age guru stuff, and that fakey accent. Please. So, how's your love life? None of your business. Don't I have a right to know who my own dad's sleeping with? Dakota, why is it that we can never have just a normal father-daughter type conversation? Yeah, right. Tyler Stone give up his true feelings? That'll be the day. Okay, you're gonna answer any normal father-daughter type question I ask? Sure. Promise. Okay, what was I to you? What do you mean what were you? When I was born. Was I an accident, a mistake, a broken condom, what? Jesus, Dakota. See, told you. That's not a normal father-daughter type question. I give up. All right, I have an answer. You were a gift from the gods. That's good, I like that. It's total crap, but I like it. I'm gonna get a shower, why don't you get dressed? I'm in the house, no one can see me. What's your uncle up to? Tyler, it's grandpa on the phone. He wants to talk to you. Tell him I'll call him back. He says it's important. Hey, Dad. Tyler, where the hell have you been? Vacation, you know that. For three god damned weeks? Who was she? What do you want, Dad? I want you to be at my house tomorrow at 10:30 sharp, and bring my beautiful granddaughter with you. I wanna see her, got it? Busted. Shut up. Be a man, Tyler. All right. Just make it happen, okay? Yes, I hear you. I know that. Look, I have so much on my plate right now. You're not listening to me. I don't need to know the details. So? She's still up there. I know she's up there, smart ass. Did you manage to keep her radio from going up with her? Goddamn it. Hey, man, you know, you told me to put her in the tree. She's in the tree. I can't remember everything. Can you manage to remember what happened in Humboldt? We don't need that crap here. Yeah, but she's not a prisoner. You know, she's gonna do whatever she's gonna do. You picked her. You need a haircut. I'll call you later. Justin! She's gonna come through for us, I promise. So, it's official, my folks. The big man himself, Senator Charles "Who Gives a Damn About the Trees" Atwood, has decided to grace our tiny hamlet with his presence. I wonder if he plans on making the claim to pay his little girl a visit. We'll be sure to keep you posted. Meantime, let's get back to the jams. From 95.3 KZMC, Cosmic Radio. So, are you guys completely over now or what? Why are we talking about him? This is supposed to be our night. It just pisses me off. He never knows when he's got it good, ever. Did you break it off or did he pull a typical Tyler and haul ass? Let's just say it was a mutual agreement. Yeah, right. In other words, you mutually agreed he's immature and just plain selfish. God, he's such an idiot. Dakota. Well, it's true. It's okay. My mom never really got over him, either. Tyler has this weird thing about him. He's kind of like a toothache. You want it to go away but you can't stop pushing your tongue against it, no matter how much it hurts. You're a great kid, Dakota. Yeah? Yeah. About time. There are supposed to be some total hotties in this thing. Ow! Grandpa. Hi, baby. God, you're getting tall. As beautiful as ever, just like your mom. Hey, go up to the house and play some video games for a while. I wanna talk with your dad. Okay. Good luck. My associates tell me you won't return their calls. Why am I here, Dad? The station's in a lot of trouble, Tyler. My people know exactly what it takes to get a business back on its feet. That's what they do. Yeah, by making us sound like every other gutless sellout on the dial? No thanks. KZMC is in the toilet. I've indulged you, I've made excuses for you ever since your mother died. But those days are over, kid. It's time to grow up. Look, Cosmic Radio is mine, all right? And I'll run it my way. You fight us on this and you lose. _ What exactly are you threatening? I'm not threatening, I'm doing. Your financial ties to the corporation are cut. We're not covering your ass any longer. You can't do that. Watch the flight of that ball because that's you. You're a loose cannon, kid. Face it, there just aren't enough advertising dollars in that town to keep you afloat. You're just not good business, son. By the way, I'm throwing a party at the house here in a couple of weeks. I want you to be there, and bring someone nice. Not any of those chippies you've been running around with. Just bring that C.C. woman who works for you. K.C., Dad, her name's K.C. Whatever, she's weird, but I like her. Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna go spend some time with my beautiful granddaughter. How's it going, everyone? It's Tyler here with you on a Saturday night. Thanks for spending it with me. In the past, you've heard me wax poetic about the importance of keeping regional radio alive. The truth is, it's getting harder every day. Now the barbarians are at the gates, people. Do we just turn over the keys or do we circle the wagons and take a shot at staying on the air before we smack into that big bad mountain known as the old corporate takeover? And that would truly suck. So, on that cheery note, if ever there was a song I wish I had written, this would be it. You're tuned to 95.3, KZMC, Cosmic Radio. KZMC. Tyler Stone, this is Rachael. Hey, Rachael, how you doing? Rachael who? Rachael Atwood, the one in the tree. That was a nice speech, got me all riled up. I beg your pardon? Oh, great, you totally moved me with this passionate soliloquy and then I get you on the phone and you're all tongue-tied? What's up with that? How are you- - My cell works up here. I'm calling to thank you. It's my favorite song you're playing. Cosmic, huh, no pun intended. When I was a little girl, I used to hide under the covers and listen to that song over and over again. It protected me from all the bad stuff. You had bad stuff as a kid? Like what? Well, you know, the usual little girl bad stuff. Afraid of the dark, afraid of monsters under my bed, afraid of my dad. Oh, yeah, your dad. Tell you, that guy's scary even now. You have no idea. Anyway, I heard what you said, and I'd like to do something to help. I was thinking like an interview. Interested? I don't understand. Hey, look, everybody's trying to get me to talk, and I'm offering you the big exclusive. A lot of people would jump all over that story. I wouldn't doubt that, but, you know, why us? Well, I guess I feel sort of karmically obligated. You did play my song, after all. Why don't you come by tomorrow, it's Sunday, so won't be any timber guys around. You mean in that tree? Is that a problem? Not a big fan of heights. God, just be here, okay? Oh, and, Tyler, come alone. Oh, shit. Hey, Tyler! Hey, Hank, how you doing? Bobby. What are you guys up to? Well, actually, me and Bobby T. here just got ourselves some extra work. For Mr. J.T. Winters himself, head of the whole goddamn timber company, ain't that right? He wants us to set up these big speakers under that girl's tree and blast her the hell outta there. You know, we was thinking maybe you could give us something to just drive her little ass right off the mountain. You know, something like that hippy hop shit they play these days? Wow, sounds like an important job. Yeah, I'll hook you up. Come on in. I told you he would, idiot. Thank you, Tyler. We'll give it right back to you as soon as we scratch the hell out of it. So, what's she like? I don't know. Interesting. Mm-hmm. Shut up. This is serious. I mean an interview with that girl could really put us on the map. So what are you worried about? You're Charlie Smooth on the air. Chatting away to, what, dozens of people every night? It's not that. It's I don't know what to ask her. Well I'm fairly up to date with what she's doing. Want me to write the questions? You'd do that? Of course. What, I don't have a stake in this? Oh man, that would be perfect. Than all I'd have to do is turn on the recorder, mute off whatever you got, with any luck, Tree Girl will do the rest. One can hope. Well, thanks K.C., you're saving my ass. You remember that, the next time I come asking for a raise. I better start working on those questions. Yeah, I guess I'll get some sleep before I climb that damn tree. Not looking forward to that. Just don't look down. I'll try to remember that. Well, I guess I'll see you in the morning. Night. You'll never learn, girl. All right, Bobby T. Let her rip. That aint no hippie hop. Turn it off. Turn it off tree-trash. Are you a retard, turn the damn thing off. Give me it! Turn it off! Give it, gimme that God damn radio! Give it to me! Tyler! Loggers go home, save our trees. Logger go home, save our trees. Loggers go home, save our trees. Loggers go home. Where were you today? How are you uncle Mike, I'm fine sweetheart, how are you? People were asking about you. They wanna know where stand on these new logging contracts. I don't stand anywhere. I'm a local cop upholding the law. You're starting to sound like a corporate lackey. You watch your mouth, girl. I'm not one of your radio pals, show some respect. The Tribal Council can't decide if this new logging project is a good thing or a bad thing. If you're in tight with those timber bigwigs, maybe you should- - Maybe I should what? K.C., why in the hell are you still here? Instead of making judgment about everyone else, maybe it's time you took a long look at your own situation. My brother didn't pay all that money for journalism school so his little girl could wind up working at two bit radio station. I'm in a transitional period. No, what you're in, is a rut. If you're so worried about our people, why are you wasting your talents here? You could be working on a major newspaper. Or maybe doing network TV. Instead, you're waiting around here for this Tyler Stone to get his shit together. That's not what I'm doing. It isn't? If you wanna make a difference, get the hell out of this town, and do something with your life before it passes you by. Come on up. How? Wonderful. Knock-knock-knock. Hello. Sorry, I had to make sure no one followed you. So, the one and only Tyler Stone. We meet at last. I'm making some tea. You want some? Nah, got a soda. Oh, it's a pipe cleaner. We all have to die of something. So, this is Lilith. Yep, this is her. My big sky box, overlooking the game of greed versus compromise. You must have fallen in a past life. You know, fear of heights can follow you around forever. It's not really the height that bothers me. It's the thought of smacking into the ground real hard. So, you wanna get started? Sure. You know, my group wouldn't be too thrilled about this interview. They want me on CNN or something. So why not talk to CNN? You know, what's the point if no one hears the message. The message is tired and old, Tyler. Besides, all the big media ever wants to talk about is my dad. It's one and only ground rule, by the way. No questions about my father. This isn't about him. Okay. You've got a great aura. Has anyone ever told you that? Oh yeah, in high school I was voted most likely to have a great aura. We've got a lot in common, you know. Is that right? Yeah, I mean, two children born of privilege. Bucking the system every chance we get. And, we both lost our moms to cancer when we were kids. How do you know so much about me? You mind? See, you playing my song, that was no accident. You know. There are no accidents, Tyler. You really moved me last night. I want you to carry my voice, Tyler. I know you'll do it right. Promise me, you'll do it right. There are no accidents. Dakota Stone? We haven't seen you around here in a while. Hey, Sheriff Nighthorse. Well, you picked quite a time to visit. This has been getting worse every day. All because of some nutcase in a tree. She's not a nutcase. I think she's awesome. You know, you're just a kid. As you get older, you'll see that, not everything is always so black and white. Get off our round, people. Go back to the city. You take it easy. You hippy freaks! Save our trees, save our trees. Okay guys, great job, let's call it a day. How do you know so much about me? You mind? See, you playing my song, that was no accident, you know. There are no accidents, Tyler. Shit. Asshole. You son of a bitch. What? There are no accidents, Tyler. Keep that or I'll shove this up your ass. K.C. Will you just listen to me for a minute? Give me the keys! No, I want you to stop, all right, and listen. What the hell is it with you? I thought you went up there to get an interview. Not get laid. I didn't get laid. It was an innocent kiss, all right? And I got the interview. Well, la-di-da, he managed to be a professional for a few moments. Where's his Pulitzer? What are you trying to say? I mean is it my professionalism that you're questioning? Or is it something else? What do you suppose would happen if her dad or that group she's with got wind of this? Any integrity we have will go right out the window. Don't you get that? Why don't you give me a break? Nothing happened. Tyler, think. A man, nearly twice her age, making out in that three house. Christ, how high school! All right! Please, just try and focus. You have a bad habit of getting sidetracked. Since when? "Native Disciple" a novel by Tyler Stone. You know, I didn't get sidetracked. It's no good, that's all. It's brilliant. You just don't have the balls to let anyone read it. No, it's shit. Now can we just drop it? Whatever. Look, I'm gonna get our asses out of the fire. But we do this my way, got it? Got it? Hello. I tried calling you earlier. Don't you ever check your messages? I am sorry. Just got a lot going on right now. I know the feeling. So, when would you like to schedule our next interview? I don't think there's gonna be another interview, Rachael. At least not with me. What are you talking about? The first one hasn't even aired yet and you're walking away? This is a big opportunity. Don't get cold feet now. Yeah, it's just getting a little more complicated. I only wanna talk to you. And you can't tell me you didn't enjoy our last little chat. You're gonna be trouble for me. I can see it already. You don't strike me as man who would run from that kind of trouble. Yeah, well maybe that's my problem. So, can I expect another visit? Don't make me beg, Tyler. Loggers go home, save our trees. Loggers go home, save our trees. And so, as protests heat up in this one sleepy little community, all eyes are on local alternate radio station, KZMC, whose exclusive interview with tree-sitter Rachael Atwood. Made national news this morning. In the interview miss Atwood not only makes claims of illegal activities by the Bitterroot Timber Company, but also levels some damaging accusations against the US Forestry Service. Though she never once mentions her father, our own News 9 investigation has turned up proof of senator Atwood's holdings in Bitterroot Timber as well as interests in logging companies throughout California and Pacific North-West. It's been two weeks since the tree sit began. Senator Atwood is still unavailable for comment. And the lumber company and Rachael Atwood show no signs of giving in. I'm Jessica Montana, Action News. I wanna state that Miss Atwood trusted us to bring her message to the public without spin or commentary. And I believe we honored that trust. We also offered Bitterroot Timber equal time, but they never responded to our phone calls. So at this juncture, I'd like to turn it over to the head of our news department, K.C. Nighthorse. K.C. Miss Nighthorse, miss Nighthorse, why do you suppose Rachael invited you up that tree after so many weeks of silence? Well it wasn't me per se, that she wanted to talk to. I just happened to be on the air when she called. Luck of the draw I guess. I think she just liked the idea of giving a break to a small market station. Did she say anything about her father off the record? No, everything she told me is on that tape. Rachael is not up there out of some desire to embarrass her dad. She and the FEA have definite goals they're trying to achieve. Will you be doing any more interviews with Rachael? Well that's up to her. But I would like to go on record as having said this. KZMC radio has made a commitment to support the three sit and I think I speak for our town as well as our advertisers, when I say that we will be giving Atwood as much airtime as she wants from now on. Did sponsors really agree to that? Yes. Get off the road, bitch. Yeah, move. Michelle, Daisy. Well, if it isn't the town back-stabber. What? It's funny, just when you think you know someone. We really appreciate the way you're so anxious to keep our husbands from working, K.C. Thanks for nothing. You guys. Some nice friends you got there. You tell Tyler I won't be listening to his show no more. Hell, never understood half the shit he was saying anyway. Mind if I join you? No, I don't mind. I see you've been shunned by the masses. I know what that's like. Jeez, I only made a statement. I wasn't trying to... You've committed the ultimate sin, K.C. It is K.C., right? Yeah. Logging money puts food on a lot of tables in this country. You spoke up, it's not a poplar move. Can I ask you something? This Tyler Stone guy, why would he let you stick your neck out like that? Maybe he just believes in what your group is trying to do. Please, let's be real here. No, that statement was your idea and now it's coming back to haunt you. How's it feel to play martyr for a cause? I'm not playing martyr to anything. Yeah, it was my idea. I thought it might add some bite to the interview. Hell, if we're trying to get noticed, let's get noticed. Well, it worked. It also helped to cover up the fact that your boss was actually the one who did the interview. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. It was a smart move by the way, putting your voice on that tape. Anybody who knows that girls history won't be too far a leap to put Tyler right into her sleeping bag. I believe in what you're trying to do. I just wonder why you would trust your cause to a girl with so much potential to screw it up. Well, Rachael does have a way of clouding any issue. When she first joined us, she wanted to be called Freedom in all the press releases. And I told her, that's not gonna happen. We have been fighting ever since. There's a lot more to her than just a daddy complex. And if she ever frees herself from all that inner child bullshit, she's gonna be a force to reckon with. And we're gonna need heroes in this game badly. Looks like we both have our inner children to deal with. Mine's 38 years old. Not bad for an old man. Thanks. What's wrong? You're not gonna get all hung-up over this, are you? I mean, I thought you were big free love guy. Look, I told you, things are getting complicated. Speaking of complicated. There's something we need to discuss. What? You know what. I turn on the radio, expecting to hear an interview between me and Tyler Stone, and instead I get some woman's voice where yours is supposed to be. What's that all about? Does it really matter? I mean, your message got out. Who cares whose voice is asking the questions. Maybe I care. Tyler, there was a reason why I asked you to do the damn interview. Remember? What? Cosmic song connection thing? Don't patronize me. I am not some airy-fairy chick, this was important to me. I'm sorry, it's not like we were trying to do anything shady. The whole age difference thing, your dad's politics. It's just better if nobody knows we have a personal connection. Okay? Better for who? Is there something else behind this whole interview thing? What do you mean? I don't know. I just get the feeling that there's something that you're not telling me. You have to stop acting so paranoid. I just wanna be kept in the loop. I mean, is that too much to ask? No. Good. Mm-kmm. I'm gonna break you of this nasty habit. Good luck. Better men than you have tried, and it led to their doom. Look, Tyler, I'm an adult. You're here because I want you here, okay? And the age thing, it's just a number. All right, Miss Atwood. I'll bow to your higher maturity level. Whatever trouble it gets me into. Smart man. Hey you, what are you doing out here? I was waiting for you. I'm sorry. I guess I was out later than I expected. It's okay. Did you eat? There's no food in the house. Shit. First thing tomorrow, we'll go out and stock up. I'm going to grandpa's house tomorrow. They're sending a car out for me. Can I ask you something without you giving me your gift from the God speech? Sure. Aren't you curious about why I just showed up here this summer? I think I know. Do you? There used to be this father and kid's pottery class. Every Saturday at the Community Center. I wanted to go so bad, but I didn't dare tell mom. She'd have made Pierre go with me. I had this fantasy that you'd just show up, ready to make clay balls or ashtrays or something. You never came. I'm sorry, Dakota. I just, really suck at this father thing. I know that. Maybe you just don't know how. How did you get to be so smart at 13? You smell like a girl. Isn't it past your bedtime? You got way too much female energy in your life, Tyler. It's gonna catch up with you, you know. Tell me about it. Just be careful, okay. You're the only father I've got. I appreciate your agreeing to speak with me again, senator. But we could have done this over the telephone. Well, I thought we had a deal. Look, Rachael has the original tape. That was my deal with her. I've given you the only version of the interview I have. Did you? And if I remember correctly, our deal was information about Rachael's well-being in exchange for an exclusive interview with you. Now, I've told you everything I know about- - Hey, just fucking stop right now. Because everything you say is bullshit. Don't even fuck with me now. If you fuck with me, you're fucking with - the wrong person. - Are you threatening me senator? Yeah, maybe I am. And you better listen. Christ. Shut up. - You don't scare me! - Shut the fuck up! Don't go fucking, walk off then. You tell these boys to take me home. Go then walk off then. Then go. This conversation is over! - Then get the fuck out! - This conversation is over! Because you never told me nothing. You never fucking told me nothing. All this cloak and dagger bullshit. You want your interview or not? Yes, yes, I want my interview. - I want my interview. - All right then. Get out your little gadget and I'll do the interview, okay? Get it out, right now, and we'll do it. Miss Nighthorse, you can have your interview. You can ask any question you like. But you're gonna throw these in the mix. On tape, we'll make a copy before you leave. That's as good as this deal gets. You take it or leave it. How long? Let's talk about the fact, that you haven't been in contact with your daughter for more than a year, senator. Why is that? Hey, Marcus. Okay. So, how we doing? No problem. Okay, thanks very much, bye. We just lost Matt and Top Realty. That's the 5th sponsor this week. K.C.'s statement kind of blew up in our faces. There's a lot of people making a living off these new logging contracts. The advertisers are heading for the hills. Has he said anything? I gotta tell you, Marcus, unless a pot of gold falls on our heads, and I mean quick, we're gonna lose this radio station. Damn. You ready to ride, cowgirl? You bet I do. Gabrielle Hunter, Free Earth Alliance. Tyler Stone. I know, I've heard so much about you I feel as if we're old pals. Really? Well I haven't heard anything about you. Oh, well in that case, we can just skip all the pleasant bullshit and get right down to business. May I sit? What business would that be, Miss Hunter? Call me Gabrielle. The business we have, Tyler, is Rachael Atwood. So, seeing that you've been chosen as the flavor of the week. No, I don't have the slightest idea of what you're talking about. Why do you think she gave you that interview? Look, you can pretend all you want that your colleague was the one with the tape recorder, but we both know better, don't we? Rachael is far too important to us, to let some horny burnt-out wannabe screw things up. I want you to get the hell out of my office! All right? Do you understand what's going on here? I mean, can you even fathom the importance of what that girl is doing? This isn't some joke. This is a major deal and you are getting in the way. What are you talking about? You really don't have a clue, do you? About what? Rachael has stopped talking to us and I think the reason is you. Let me clue you in, Tyler. Rachael Atwood has been arrested five times since she joined us. She's dedicated but every time her dad comes bepopping in the picture. Open your eyes, stud. She's playing you like a rusty old fiddle. Thanks for the info. But I think you should leave. Men. She's got you so blind, you can't see the forest from the tree girls. Wise up, Tyler, before you really put a monkey wrench in my works. Too much female energy. Now I mean she was homely, hound-dog homely. She looked like she fell out of the ugly tree, hit every branch on the way down. She was so ugly, you could stick her face in some doe and made god damn gorilla cookies. You'd have laughed your ass off. I took her home at the end of the night. I told her mom you might not recognize her, 'cause I shaved her back. She had these tattoos, she had a W here and a W there. Can she do these cartwheels that say wow mom, wow. Don't those guys ever go home? Those guys have no lives. Wow, she hates it when you hit Lilith. You know, those things give you cancer. Lighten up, grumpy. Dakota, I told you, it's too dangerous for you to keep coming up here. I'm small, I can move around quieter than those grangers you hang out with. Justin? Hey, it's between you two rich girls. Besides, she paid for gas. Did you call Gabriella yet? Rachael, what are you trying to prove, cutting yourself off like this? I mean, you realize that in the end, you're just making these assholes stronger? I know, I know, I just, I don't wanna deal with it right now, okay. It's all about my name with her. Get real, man. What, you think you're the only one who could have pulled this off? Think again. The fact is your name's the whole point. This action's not about what we do. It's about who you are. Your name's the spark, Rachael. Without it, there's no fire. Just another hippie chick, sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-I-N-G. Shut up, Justin. Forget it, Dakota. Some people act like they know more than they really do. Whatever. Just remember something, you've got a lot people looking up to your right now. And you're pissing all that away with your little game. Let's go, Dakota. And do us all a favor, call Gabi. She knows her shit, Rach. She's been doing this since we were in diapers. Dakota. Yeah, I thought I'd find you here. Marcus, you're saving my life. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I definitely could use a little testosterone around me right now. A little testosterone? I mean, that's what my ex has been telling me too. Hey, Marcus. Hey, what's up, Bridget? Let me get something cool and wet. You got it. Yo, I heard that FEA woman was definitely all over you this morning. Oh yeah. Rachael's stopped talking to her. And they figure it's all my fault. That's why you gotta cut that girl loose. Before someone seriously gets hurt. I mean you haven't slept with her or anything, so there's no harm no foul. Ah man, you're a dirty, disgusting dog. I can't believe you. What, up in the tree house? I don't know about you man. Me and you have two totally different sets of priorities. While you're up in the tree house playing, the rest of us are trying to save your radio station. Yeah, well, I've been a little preoccupied. Preoccupied? Man, you're dead in the water. Hope she's worth losing your business over. Senator Charles Atwood today finally broke Senator Charles Atwood today finally broke his three-week silence over his daughter Rachael's much publicized tree-sit, in Idyllwild, California. Ay, yo, it's Atwood. Hey, Bridget, turn it up. The senator granted an exclusive interview with the only person his daughter has agreed to speak with since her ascent into the 500-year-old tree, disc jokey, K.C. Nighthorse. From Idyllwild's little radio station that roared, KZMC. Shit, K.C. Sorry, thank you. Tyler, I've got a message for you. Yeah, but that's K.C. you're talking about. You know she's a smart woman. - I gotta get hold of my dad. - Tyler, I... You know, we could be on shaky legal ground here. Tyler! What? Look, I'm sorry, Tiff, what are you trying to say? Your dad called, Dakota never came home from the movies this afternoon. I tried your cellphone, but. Shit. I saw Dakota today. She was riding around with that FEA kid, Justin. Who? Yeah, I didn't think anything about it, 'cause she's been at that tree-sit so much, but. She's been where? Shit! Tyler. I know where that kid camps. Hell! You son of a bitch. Dude, what is your problem? Justin? Who's that? That's my girlfriend, Sunflower. Sunflower? Yeah, Sunflower, you got a problem with that? Tyler, what are you doing? That's it, throw a fit, you little brat. I don't care. What did I do that's so terrible, huh? I'm not a baby. You're 13 years old, Dakota, 13! You actually thought no one would worry? Jesus Christ. Yeah, right, like you ever gave a shit about me. Since when did you become the concerned father? I don't need this. Oh, hell no. Tyler Stone doesn't need this? Tyler Stone doesn't need to be reminded that 13 years ago he knocked somebody up? A daughter? I have a daughter? Why didn't somebody tell me I have a daughter? You know it all, don't you, kid? And I'm sure your mother made damn certain you got both sides of the story. You're an asshole. For better or worse, she raised me all alone. Don't even try to make her the bad guy. God, every other girl I know has a father. And what do I get, a Tyler! Eh, tell your mom I hope her and Pierre have a great time in India. On my family's money. At least Pierre's not half her age. Yeah, Justin told me all about you and Rachael, so you can stop sneaking around. Everybody knows, everybody! Dickhead. And here's your grandfather. Let's see how long he can put up with your crap. Can I help you? Comrade Stalin, I presume? I wanna tell you something and I wanna make it very clear, Mister Stone. I want you to stay away from my daughter. You've got one too, her name's Dakota, right? And I know that, because you're a dad and so am I. I'm giving you mercy now. But don't you ever forget, vengeance is, something that my associates are, very familiar with. I'll stay away form her. Okay. Okay. I got to hand it to you, Tyler. You do make life interesting. Hey, Mike. So you're my guardian angel. Who'd have figured. So what, you think that all cops are just jack-booted thugs for corporate infrastructure? Yeah, pretty much. You know, my ancestors, they are buried all over this mountain. Do you think the timber companies give a shit? Hell no, they just go right in and cut everything till there's nothing left. Drag their bulldozers all over sacred land. You can't go toe-to-toe with these bastards. No, they're too damn big. But, if you get the right man, say a local sheriff, laying low and pulling strings from the inside, he could do you more good than a hundred of these rich white girls sitting in trees. All she's really done is turn this into a grudge match with her father. And that interview, just made things worse. So why are you here? I think we can say that, someone I care about very much would be upset if something bad happened to you. You know, the Elders say that, you find a man who's lost his vision trail, you point him in the right direction, and the spirits will smile down on you forever. So you take it slow, partner. Hey Mike, are you gonna give me a ride back, or? No, they said to point you in the right direction. They didn't say anything about hauling your sorry ass around. Find out what's important in life, Tyler. That's the key. It's day 20 in Rachel Atwood's tree-sit. A landmark for the FEA. But here in Idyllwild, locals and protesters alike are taking a break from all of the hoopla and just enjoying the 4th of July celebration. Wow. If it isn't the big time reporter. What the hell happened to you? A few new listeners. Guess they don't like the playlist. Why didn't you tell me. It was a, an unscheduled interview. A lot of that going around. I have stuff to do. Tyler. Tyler, hey, hope you don't mind me barging in, but your on air sign was out. Do I know you? Oh, we could talk normal. Yeah, no, no you don't. David Vasquez, Pegasus radio, New York. Okay. I came by to see K.C. Nighthorse. Wow, that's obviously not her. Hey, sweety, nice. You running a little kiddie radio here, or? It's K.C.'s day off. Pegasus, that's satellite, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah it is. It's the second largest satellite network in the country, Jesus Christ, this is an 8-track. That's a 4-track with a boot on it. You're living a little dangerously here, buddy, aren't you? You ever heard of digital? What do you want with K.C.? Are you kidding? Man, the story's all over the place that she's been working on. Heard about all the buzz, figured I'd come out here and, you know. You really broadcast out here, don't you? Wow, that is, that is nifty. Yeah. Well, we're busy, so have you got a card or something? I do, yeah, yeah. Here you go. Give that to K.C. Cell number's on the back and just tell her to give me a call, 'cause I'd love to talk to her. I'll hang out for a couple of days here in town, check out the sights in about 30 minutes and I have no idea what after that. But yeah, Tyler, very nice to meet you. By-the-by, any of the stuff that you don't get rid of on Ebay, let me know man, I got some buddies at the History Channel, they would love to check it out. Child labor laws, dude, just be careful. For an old man, he's pretty hot. Shut up. In response to judge James Lee's ruling yesterday in favor of the Bitterroot Timber Company, attorneys for the FEA immediately filed and expedited appeal in the federal court. We'll keep you updated on that ruling, which is expected later this week. I'm, I'm Marty Kelly, Action 9 News. Just remember something, you've got a lot of people looking up to you right now. And you're pissing all that away with your little games. Senator, she's here. All right, let her in. Here she is, the queen of the tree fairies. Got the crap, Charles. How much did Bitterroot pay the judge for that nice little gift he just laid in their laps? Every time you people have some judge that goes against you, you think that there's conspiracy. Maybe they're just trying to do the right thing. You wouldn't know the right thing if it bit you in the ass. Is there a reason why you came here to speak with me? Aren't you the least bit concerned Rachael might get hurt? Nothing's going to happen to Rachael. You hope. Look, I know you two are right in the middle of one of your emotional tug of wars, but you can't fool me. It's been way too easy getting in to that tree the past few weeks. Well, I wouldn't know about that because I'm not a tree climber. Just be careful how far you're willing to let this go. You look good, Charles. That suit fits you better than your politics. What? It's that satellite radio guy, Vasquez. Vasquez. You met him? K.C., K.C. Thanks for arranging the invite. Hello, David. Tyler, see you've managed to free yourself from the antique shop for the evening. Nice. Manners. Please allow me to introduce you to my personal assistant, Jade Omaha. Jade, this is Mister Tyler Stone. Is that your 67 up front? Yeah, it is. You know cars? I know Mustangs. And this is our lady of the hour, K.C. Nighthorse. The voice behind the controversy. Nice job. We try. Jade do me a favor and keep an eye on Mister Stone for a while. He's a very dangerous man. I need a moment with K.C. It would be my pleasure. So, you're a retro guy, huh? What makes you say that? Well, you drive a classic car, and David tells me that your radio station's a bit old school. I mean, personally, I like that vibe. But you could see how it could be looked upon as, hey? I'm not used to being ignored by men, Tyler. It's a generous offer, David. And I appreciate it, I really do. It's just. What, what, what? I don't know. New York. A big corporation. It's a bit overwhelming. And I haven't told anyone yet. But I've already taken a radio job in Idaho. I'm already packed. Look I'm not gonna hit you with a whole minorities in the media routine. You're way smarter than that and I'm sure you've heard it a million times before. But I gotta tell you, the way you've taken on this story with the tree girl, it's very pro stuff. And I know a star when I see one. Have a nice little chat with your new friend? Yeah, as a matter of fact I did. Whatever. Run away, that's what you're best at. You know what your problem is? Your problem is that you want the freedom to come and go as you wish, but you expect that when you come back your little universe is gonna be exactly the same. Well it just doesn't work that way. Why is everybody always under your god damn microscope? My lifestyle hasn't been all that bad. Yeah, it's worked great for you so far. You have a daughter you hardly know, a dying radio station and an unfinished novel. Oh, and you've been sleeping with a girl only a few years older than Dakota. Good job! Oh, come on. You think I didn't know about you and the wood nymph? Please. You're so damn predictable, Tyler. And what about you making deals behind my back with senator ass-wipe? Don't even go there. I was trying to help the station. That's bullshit. You've been using that interview to pave yourself a nice little career path. Hey, it's better than screwing in a tree. And you know what else? You're gonna wind up a lonely old man with nothing to show for your life but a box of panties left by women marking their territories. Now, there's a future to look forward to. I don't need this. Oh, come on, come back. The night is young. Wow. I just had deja vu. I love that. Oh. Where'd you get that? Your dad. Are you enjoying yourself? Mm-hmm. Well don't blame me when you're puking on the dance floor later. Oh, chill out. It's not like I've never had a guitar before. Aren't those your favorite shoes? No. You about through, I mean, can we get going? No, I need a few more minutes. I don't think it all came out yet. Here. Remember what you were saying earlier, about the station and about us? Tyler let's not play this game. What game? You pretend to give a damn about my feelings. You know, I don't know what you want from me, K.C. I mean, I can't be everything you need me to be, and you won't be my friend unless I am. There's no way to win here. You always win, Tyler, that's your problem. And if you really cared about me, you'd let me go, instead of dangling your knee from me like a god damn carrot. Well those days are coming to an end, buddy. I'm leaving, and you will have driven off the only woman who's actually right for you. Congratulations. What are you talking about? I have a job offer in New York. Satellite radio, not this old-school save your pants crap. They offered me a contract and I took it. Happy? I know I am. I'm finally getting the hell out of Tylerland! Yeah, I'm happy for you. I think a change will do you good. Is that all you could say? I can't believe you're letting me go. Get out of my life, you jerk! Where are you going? Anywhere you're not. K.C. will you get back in the car, come on. Leave me alone. Come on, I said get back in the car. Get your hands off of me, get your hands off me. What are you gonna do, hitchhike all the way home? Yeah, go to hell. Will you get back in the car, come on. You're acting like a baby. Hey, you should know, you're sleeping with one. Just get back in the car, would you? Well, if it aint Tyler Stone. Could you guys leave, we're talking here. No, actually, we got a little bone to pick with you, boy. Yeah, you made us look pretty stupid to our boss. You don't need my help to look stupid, dear Bobby. Tyler. Boy, you can be a real prick sometimes, Tyler. Hey. What do you say, we just kick the holy dog shit out of you right now. Well, I'd say when it comes to dog shit, you'd be the expert there, Hank. Stop it! You little Indian shit. God damn, she just hit me in the eye. You know what, screw you two maniacs. You deserve each other. Jesus, she hit me right in the eye, did you see that? Assholes! Oh, Tyler, are you all right? When did I become everybody's punching bag? I'm sorry. I know about you and Tyler. Dear Tyler. I guess it's me running away this time. But to be honest, it doesn't fell like running at all. More like climbing out of a river whose current I'm just not strong enough to fight. I can't wait around for the man to step up from inside the little boy. I have too much growing up of my own to do. But that doesn't mean I will ever forget you. You were the best of times, you were the worst of times, but one thing is certain. You were never boring. I love you, Tyler, I always will, forever, K.C. My whole life, I've been doing stupid shit. Just to get back at my dad. It's like second nature. After my mom got sick, I saw this news on TV about the rainforest. They showed a video of my dad and some other senators and, my God. His wife was dying, and there he was, voting against the global ban on clear-cutting. Shooting down even the possibility that there might be some unknown root or plant or something that could save her. I love him, Dakota, but it's hard, having a father who's sole purpose for living is to make a profit. You still didn't answer my question. What about Tyler? I don't know what to say. You know Tyler, he grows on you. Like a toothache. I never meant to hurt you, Dakota. Things just got complicated. But he's so old. Rachael Atwood, Sheriff Mike Nighthorse here. I have a court order that gives me full authority to remove you from this property. Now we can do this one of two ways. You either come down on your own or we'll come up after you. Yeah, come on down, baby. I've got a tree you can sit on. Shut the hell up, Hank. You're gonna have to come up here and pull me down. Dakota, you gotta go. I'm not going anywhere. They'll have to catch us both. You are going down, this is not a debate. Now get your stuff and go. Now! Dakota Stone is up here with me, I'm dropping the ladder so she can leave. Goddammit, what's that kid doing up there? Rachael, I don't wanna leave you. Dakota, please, you'll only make things worse. Go slow, Dakota, take it easy. Rachael, they're coming. Dakota, Dakota! Dakota! Rachael! Dakota! No, no, don't touch her. Christ. In a surprise move today, Bitterroot Timber without explanation shut down all logging operations on the forestland near Idyllwild, California. The protesters who have been demonstrating here since the logging plans were first announced seemed as surprised as anyone at this sudden turn of events. All we know is, a written statement was delivered by Sheriff Nighthorse a few hours ago informing us that the timber company was recalling all of it's crew and moving operations to another part of the state. Is your group looking at this as a victory? We don't know what it is. Our legal team is reviewing all of our options, but at this point, no further action is necessary here in Idyllwild. We're moving on. You're late. Some last minute stuff I had to do. You get a hold of her mom? Yeah, she's on a flight back right now. She wanted to know what kind of a father lets his 13-year-old kid climb around in a 100 foot tree. I'm wondering the same thing myself. It's my fault. I should have never let her hang out up there. You're not to blame, Rachael. You decide where you're headed yet? South America maybe. A lot of rainforest down there, just begging to be saved. That's great, I'm glad to hear it. I mean, you know, the fight goes on. Listen to you, Tyler. Be careful, you're starting to sound like a tree-hugger. It's funny, isn't it? The tree-sit? Taught me a lot about myself. Kind of like you and this radio station. You know, sometimes we run from the things we love the most. It's a big responsibility, caring. How did you get so smart at 20? I should really learn to read these things a lot better. So, will I ever see you again? Maybe bump into accidentally in a jungle somewhere? There are no accidents, Tyler. You should know that by now. Take care of yourself, Freedom. What's up with that? Hell if I know. But we better start clearing out our desks. Interesting day, huh? Mister Stone, you wanna fill us in on what just occurred here? Tyler didn't tell you anything? Rachael cut a deal with her old man. I knew it, I knew those timber guys bounced outta here too easy. Yeah, she was just too much of an embarrassment. She told him, she'd only climb down out of the tree if he cut out all of the operations here. I don't believe this. Oh, she was going to come down anyway after Dakota fell. Guess she wanted to just get some mileage up. Of course, it's only a five-year moratorium. They'll be back. Unless someone figures out a way to get them out of here for good. Yeah, but that doesn't explain what went on here. Now that was off the hook. Part of the deal was the senator was gonna set up a trust. The Charles Atwood Media Arts Foundation. Sole beneficiary, Cosmic Radio. That's ironic, huh? No way. Yeah, the station goes on, same format. I retain the licensing and you're the new head, Marcus. - What? - What? Starting next week. And I can't think of a better bloke to take charge. But what about Tyler? He's out. Atwood would only go along with this if Tyler agreed to step down as station manager. I'm gonna tell you two something. This surprised the hell out of me. This is the hardest damn thing he's ever done, signing away this station. So you call me on Monday, kid. We'll go over the details and I look forward to working with you. Both of you. Bloody hell. Man is master of his own fate. The fault is not in our stars but in ourselves. But there's definitely something bigger out there that has a hand in what we do and who we are. And in my case it feels as though that higher energy has been bouncing me on my ass a lot lately. Trying to knock me out of my self-imposed exile from responsibility. A famous poet once said, "You're never far from home, when you carry that home within your heart." And if that's true, then I'll never be very far from this place, ever. So on that cheery note, I just wanna say, thank you, adios and, I guess I'll catch you on the flip side. That was our very own Tyler Stone everybody. Former station manager, and all around peachy guy. I gotta tell you ladies, he looks like he's gonna do just fine. You're tuned to the one and only, 95.3, KZMC, Cosmic Radio. Still driving the chick magnet, I see. What are you doing here? I came to ask you a question. What do you think the school systems are like in New York? I don't know. I'd imagine they're pretty good. Don't suppose it'd hurt to just check it out, do you? What your mom say about this? Pierre seems to think you and I need to spend some healing time together. She'll go along with anything that dude says. What about you? I think a little father-daughter female energy might do you some good, dad. But we need to establish a few house rules. House rules? Like what? Like setting a time limit on your little vacations and remembering to call when you're gonna be out late. You're really bad about that. And another thing. You gotta stop carrying this around. It's a little weird. The summer I turned 13, my mom traveled to India to find herself. I moved to New York City with my dad, to find the woman he loved. It was the best summer of my life, so far.
