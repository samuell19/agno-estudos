Make it fast! That bugger's gone. Roll it. What do you think, Master? Majestic! CINEMAWALA Eighty five rupees for the Silver cups. Don't buy it from me, I don't need to sell it. A new lot is here, go get that. How much?- -6 Kilograms. Which one? Pick up this lot, send it for weighing! The fish is good, give me a good price first! Send these over there, will you! Get the Sole fish! Get those weighed. What is your last offer? Listen, no point bargaining like this. Give Master one cup too.- -Saifful, weigh the Ktla fishes! How far?- -Nearly done. You're the only one in the country, Master, who buys the newspaper only on Fridays. Read it. Bengali or the Hindi ones first? Obviously the Bengali ones. Two releases this week. 'Chhupa Rustam'... Inox, Forum, Quest Mall, South City...- -Why are you reading those? Only the single theatres. Nandan, Navina, Priya, Mitra, Prachi, Star, Indira, Malancha, Padmasree, Sonali, Asoka, I'm not lowering the price, take it or leave it. Read loudly! Baruipur Showhouse, Koiri, Rupbani, Krishti, Kalyani, Sangam, Jyoti, Surendra, Which Jyoti is this?- -At Chandanagar. It's under the Rakhhit family now. Next? Sangita, Sitala, Rupkatha, Indradhanu, Debjani, Joy Maa, Shurjo, Kamal, Rupmaya, Chitrabani, Meena, Sarathi, Annapurna... Had invested in films too. Crazy about cinema. His alcohol finished him. He wasn't careful at night. Spilled a full bottle of rum on the carpet. The carpet was completely drenched. Dozed off with a smoke in his hand. The smoke fell on the carpet. That's it. It went ablaze. 60% burn. He was a good exhibitor. Know what he'd say? "What rum is to alcohol, fame is to cinema!" I had gone for his funeral. Sort it out. You are very stubborn. Can you deny your own blood? May God bless you, son. So?! Still such a kid! Don't forget the Hilsa fish for the Saraswati Puja. Bring your father along. Rather, I'll go invite him. Making some Dhoka curry for lunch. Had your breakfast?- -Not yet, let your son come. Another one?- -No. Your son said he has to go to Kolkata to fetch goods. Please eat, I'll be back. Come on now, leave me! Welcome! But I'm always there at my office. How about a lunch at my humble abode one day? Everyone fine at home? Okay, take care. The District Magistrate. Wondering why this sudden visit at this hour? That too from the temple? What is it, Akhil? If I let it out so easily, the cinema will flop, Sir! Here...- -Yes. Even climbing a few steps makes me out of breath. Hasn't your son told you anything? Maybe he was feeling shy. Here. We're both about to become grandfathers, Sir. Now open your mouth, come on. Here. It seems our kids became adults too soon. By God's grace. You're becoming a grandfather, Sir! Boy! This is such a great news! The bigger news is, Akhil, my son is becoming a father. A father. That's the last day for Hilsa fish! It must melt in the mouth! I've already told them. Come along with Mou in the morning. Okay? See you, Sir! Oh no! I just forgot!- -What? The Village Panchayat elections are coming up. Sudhangshu might come to you. He needs to talk to you. Do what you think is okay. I've no obligations regarding this, Sir. Bye. Let's go. Leave me! Leave me! Don't come near me! Don't come close to me! I'll kill you... I'll kill you! Had your lunch? When did you leave home? About 11am. What is it, suddenly? Last time you came was before marriage. With your wife. What is it this time? Boy or a girl? Err... not yet. I came to give you the news. How did you know? You won't come without a big news. So I thought, what else would it be. You wouldn't come in this attire if... ...it was a bad news. It's getting cold. Right. Film DVDs for cheap rate. I sell them. Remember Ashim da from the Dutta family? He had a problem with his speech. Would pronounce my name as 'Pokaad'. Abha's elder son.- -Yes, him. We're partners in business, his space, the stuff is mine. We rent out and sell, both. Hindi and Bengali films. What about the wholesale market? It's going on. I manage it in the mornings. But that's about it. Baba takes care of everything. Once my business shapes up, I'll stop going. Very difficult to work with him. Takes a hasty bath after the fish market, gets into the cinema hall. Isn't back before eleven. God knows what he does there, like a wandering spirit! Is Hari still there? Where'll he go? Stuck to him all day like a leech. He cannot stand properly when he comes back. But you can't tell him anything. Says, he's my "father's employee". Hope you give time to your home? Has the doctor given a date? Yes... there's time. In September. Sit. I'll get that. Give me. Come. Baba, look who's here. Your grandson, Prakash. He cannot speak since he had the stroke. Come here. Take this. For your wife. If it's not a huge problem let me know after the baby is born. May God bless you, son. Now that you have a family, give it time. Don't forget your wife, making a Taj Mahal in her name, like your father. I won't. Here. Uttam Kumar came in and stood there like this. A huge bouquet of red roses near his belly. Supriya Devi smiled and him and said, "Which friend gave you those flowers?" The same enthralling smile spread on his face. He staggered slowly towards the room. That's when Supriya Devi noticed, what did she notice? Hello! Answer me! That it was not a bouquet of roses, patches of fresh blood. His fans did that to him at a programme. Master, this is the 37th time you're telling me this story. Not a story, Hari. Fact! Fact. The famine of 1943. Independance at 1947. The partition. Its despair. Lacs of people, uprooted. Refugees. Poverty. You see Hari, people were looking for an escape route at that time. Something else... as in... something totally different. Someone who relieves them from this bull crap. As in, some sort of an alcohol. Raw alcohol. That's when the Bengalis found Uttam Kumar. Uttam Kumar. The Superstar. To be reincarnated in every era. A very middle class looking, prince of the fairy tales. Magic! All his films ran upto a golden jubilee. You've seen it. The one and only ideal husband for all Bengali women, Uttam Kumar! (dialogue plays in recorder) Hey... do you hear the voice? Heard this 200 times.- -Shut up! 200 times? Uncultured fellow! Are you satisfied in 200 times? You've to hear this voice all your life, over and over again. 200 times? Goddam owl! Because I was new, he threatened me...- -Arindam, the fact that you're finicky... it's a very good sign. This means you'll succeed.- -I will. I sure will! I will go to the top, the top, the top! Come on, hold it. Here...- -Give it to me. Had a comfortable journey? Yes, it's quite late, so the train was empty. This is quite heavy.- -Mind your step. Yes. These train timings can go heywire. I've been sitting here for the last 2 hours. Found all the films, Prakash?- -Yes, found some good films. Got some new releases too.- -And the one with Dev in it? Yes, Sir!- -That's great! Say that in English.- -What? What you just said, 'very good', say it again. Stop pulling my leg. Put on a monkey cap or something. It's cold. Hey. See, there's no one around. Say it, 'very good'. No! The political turmoils are back again, Hari. Murders, plunderings, rapes, again. People are getting into schools and shooting kids down! You find gunpower instead of yielded crops in the village houses. Crusades, extremism. Cheating the common man, oppressing them. And this fight is creating new nations in every neighbourhood. A partition between friends. Barbwires stretched accross beds. Get it?- -No. Rascal. With the rise of unrighteousness, I manifest myself. Cinema, theatre, literature, all that comes later. The kitchen is burning down. What to eat? You see, Hari, this chaos, is making people tired. This is when someone is needed. The superstar of dreams. A hero. An... ...escape route. He'll come. He'll come! That is why people like you and me are not dying yet. All out of hope and passion. Cinema! You always said, "Sort it out, Master. After all, he's your blood!" It is this blood that I am ashamed of, you swine! How can this blood be a thief, how can it be so shameless!? Son of exhibitor, Pranabendu Das, he sells fake, pirated DVDs! Utterly illegal! And he proudly claims that he's doing business! Bullcrap! Disgusting! Bloody thief! Antisocial! It's for these people that of so many cinema halls... ...only a mere few remain. Goddam DVDs! CDs! And where is this happening? In my house. In the room right beside mine. My blood, huh? This is my blood? Now, get up, Master. It's quite late. Won't you go home? I don't feel like it. I don't feel like going to that house, Hari! I hate it! That's why I say, don't drink so much. Come on, Master, get up. Wash your face. Ugh! What? Dirty collars are common in winters. Put a hanky on your neck like my father? Looks so nice. No, it looks rednecked.- -Not at all. You don't struggle to clean it. I've got you something special. What special thing? Not one, two. One's special, the other's a little less special. Come on now. I'll tell you. All in good time. But you must pay up, honey. Come here. Fine, don't tell me. I'll go heat up the food. Already? But I'm just... -Look at the clock. It'll take time to serve dinner. Careful, Master. The path's uneven. With the wheel of change, Comes joy, comes sorrow It's turning! It's turning! Round and round. Joy and sorrow, sorrow and joy. Going round and round. As the night falls, you say such difficult words. Even your Bengali sounds like English! I'm saying happiness will come. It's coming! The one who shall destroy you is being nurtured in a stable Let him become a father first, let him pull the plough with his heavy shoulders. I won't have to do anything. Nothing at all. Remove the glass.- -Yes, wait. Remove that jug too!- -Wait! There's water spilt everywhere! The handle is broken. I'll fix it tomorrow. Why Baba's paper, you could've got a dry rag. I kept aside the page he collects, the one with the cinema ads. He'll not think twice before passing a sharp comment. He won't say anything. Start eating. This maxy is wet, I'll change and come. Go. Hello, listen, which newspaper do you keep on Fridays? Keep that aside. I'll take it from you tomorrow. Okay, bye. Don't worry about the paper so much. He won't say anything. Honey...- -There... Coming. She fooled me today! I didn't have a clue! You won't carry the lunch to the hall from tomorrow. Not in this condition. Hari will come. You can go now. Baba...- -Yes, honey? I spoilled your newspaper. But I've kept the cinema page aside. That's good enough. I'm a bit... It's alright. Go, sleep. The one who shall destroy you is being nurtured in a stable Wherever you go, my love Nothing will soothe your wounds Grandmother? What? Start eating. In a bit. You think I am stupid? You thought I won't understand... ...what special thing you got from Kolkata. What did you understand? I saw what's there in the bag. I saw it when I went in to change. What did you see? The yellow sari.- -Oh! So you've found it! Very good. There's good news and the Saraswati Puja is ahead too. Wear it to your parent's. And... ...the less special one? The less special one? It's inside the bag itself. Go see. Go! Please switch it off! Isn't it good?- -Very nice! You are home alone during the power failures. You must be careful at this time, that's why. This is special too. Thank you. Now will you eat? This is All India Radio. The daily news: The date for the budget is between 21st February to 10th May. 26th February, rail budget. 28th February, overall budget. There'll be a break from 22nd March to 22nd April in longer discourses... Our Lordship hasn't arrived yet. You manage the dealings. Subal, let me count it. Stay outside. Mufuzul, make it fast, it's getting late. Come on now, quick! Ashim da, listen.- -Yes. We'll screen films at the fair, get it? All new releases. Here. Look at this stuff! Video projector. Runs DVDs. Saw it in Kolkata yesterday. It's brilliant! What is this madness, Prakash?- -Give me a smoke. Quick! And do what I say. Get the decorator. I've chalked out the entire plan last night. The measurements are done. Can you imagine? About 500 people in a show, with tickets! Inform Kailash Decotators. You know Tukai da, right? Bring him along, I'll be ready here. Can I ask you something? What did you eat for dinner? Hey, Prakash,- -Ask him to get a tape. Where's the time? Posters, tickets and... ...there's a basic preperation...- Will you lack a stable if you buy a cow? It won't matter. Hope you didn't create a rumpus at home last night? Then maybe he's ill. When I left I saw his bike wasn't there. I'm going to Kolkata, prepare the lunch fast. Okay. Master, the fish. Let's go. Who is it? Who's there? Who is it? Hari... ...hey Hari, see who's over there! Hey! Get out of here! Out! Go. Honey...- -Yes... Yes?- -Got some fresh Cat fish! Very good for you during this time. Why didn't he go to the fish market? Is he ill? Where's he? Why didn't you come to the market? Won't go anymore. Don't feel the need to inform that? No. I'm my father's employee, I'm allowed that much. Don't give arrogant replies. It is an old family business. You'll come and go at your free will? Is this a joke? Maybe. Like I said, I won't go. I'll try to make do without being a fisherman. Ask him the rates for the Cat fish. Fisherman? Now pull it. Pull it till that end. The screen will be set here, a little higher up. Put a double tarpaulin covering in front of it. And a hundred chairs each on both sides and behind. Keep space for movement in the middle and both sides. All of this in 3 days.- -3 days!? Yes, figure out how, but I want it. Increase the labour. Money's not an issue. Okay, it'll be done.- -Okay. I'm at work, I'll call you later, okay? Ashim da...- -Tell me. Ashim da, there's no time to print posters. Hire two rickshaws, put a sound box and mic in it. And tickets?- -You'll get it tomorrow. I'm getting butterflies in my stomach. Aren't we going overboard? Stop nagging. Never seen films at the fair ground? Only once. 'Kshudiram, the Revolutionary'. There was no place on the ground so I sat behind the screen. Inverted picture. Are you scared? Then don't do it. I'm not scared.- -Then what is it? Tension. Listen, 5 rupees for the ground, in front. 20 rupees for the chairs. If there are minimun 400 people, 5000 rupees per show. Three shows in a day. Even after sound, electricity and the decorators, we'll take home quite a bit. And the main thing?- -What? The machine? It has a name, tell me.- -Err.. pro.. ...don't pull my leg. Can I say something, brother? May I? The main thing, the capital, where're you getting it from? Someone's giving me.- -Who? Gouri Sen.- -Who's he? My uncle-in-law.- -Then it's okay. Fine. Listen, this is important.- -Yes, tell me. Ashim da,- -Yes? just say it once, 'projector'. Try it, you can! 'Projector', say it? Don't pull my leg.- -Please, come on. I can't what I can't. Leave it! Always putting me in embarrassing situations. Please eat. I too won't eat if you don't. What's the rate for breakfast? Please eat. Please don't insult me anymore. I'm eating now. But no more. The cinemawala... Pranabendu Das, is long dead. As long as the fisherman, Pranabendu Das lives, he can manage alone. Don't give me your food. No more. Go, eat. I'll eat, go. Friends, today; as the chief guest at the 24th Harvest fair's inaugeration, we're honoured to have with us, the famous author, Mr. Salil Baran Chattopadhay. All well wishers of this neighbourhood are requested... ...to come to the fair with friends and family, thereby making it a success! Great news! Great news! We have our very own son of Bengal, Dev, the evergreen Prosenjit, along with Jeet and the great Mithun! Bengal's favourite heroine, Koel, Bengal's daughters Srabanti and Shubhasree... and the naughty and sweet, Payel! Only 5 rupees for the ground, 20 rupees for the chairs. Collect your tickets from this promotional vehical right now! For your convenience, we're carrying some tickets in this vehical. Grab your tickets and book your seats right now! Enjoy movies in digital system, also enjoy music in modern sound system. Fresh hot films at the fairground! Do not delay! Buy your tickets first! Think later! Come, the food is getting cold. Bring your family... Have made some fried fish, dal and brinjal fry today, Master. Enough for tonight's dinner for the two of us. Please bear with my cooking. God knows how you're eating my food everyday. You keep asking me to sort it out with him. Sort it out... ...this won't get sorted. This'll become bigger. Till today he was stealing. Now, robbing people in broad daylight. It's okay, now eat. 5 rupees on floor and 20 rupees for the chairs! Nonsense. Who is your wife? Who, your child? The worldly life is a deep mystery Who are you? Where have you come from? Ponder on these thought, my brother. Chant the name of Lord Vishnu Chant the name of Lord Vishnu, O ignorant human Do not harbor the pride of wealth, company and youth; For time strips one of everything, in an instant The whole of this world is rife, with illusion A huge electric ferry wheel this time at the fair. The smaller wooden one is there too. But the crowd is flocking around the bigger one. It is so huge! How's the footfall? -Quite a bit, Master. Are their stall?- -It's crowded. But one can't tell if they've come for the shows. Can't you tell from the queue at the counters? I can't go too close, he'll think you've sent your spy. Oh no! Now? Now what? What happens to the fresh hot films? You're so childish, Master. They ought to have a generator at the fair these days. Wait. Keep your ears open, you'll get to hear. There! Don't light the lamp.- -Don't be such a miser. Just got a can of oil yesterday. Let it be dark for a bit. Hari... call Mr. Nabin and ask him to take the projectors away. What! Yes. The hit pair Dev-Koel have set the fair on fire! Remember, only a few more tickets left! Keep moving everybody!- -Hey Prakash! Put up the Housefull board! And straighten that line! Get in! Get in!- -It's a housefull! Don't keep mum, Hari. Don't keep mum. They're not making any movies on film... ...to run on your beloved projector duo. Only digital cinema! What did Mr. Nabin say?- -He'll let us know at night. Master...- -What? Can we really not go digital? The hall has been closed since a long time. The screen, the chairs, the sound, everything is ruined. The roof is dripping. The rate Mr. Nabin is giving, none of this can be repaired. Even if we do it, people won't come everyday, Hari. The cheap and fake stuff at the fair... will excite them for sometime. But can that feed you all your life? It'll be back to where it started from. This is cinema! Big screen! Cinema... Neither the hall. Nor the family. I could not run any of them properly. I'm just a fisherman. A fisherman. Mr. Pranab... -Who's that now, see. -Yes. Sudhangshu. Sudhangshu, who?- -From the political party. Call him. Wait, I'll come down, he'll inside. Switch the chandelier on. (popular Bengali film song) Politics is not my cup of tea. The Panchayat vote, chairmanship... ...I am happy with this one chair I have, Shudhangshu. But that Karl Marx' photo on the wall... -How did you miss out on the Tagore and Uttam Kumar? Isn't it better to give way to the new? Your Marx himself said so. Negation of negation? Nothing is eternal. Yes, nothing is eternal. Don't drag this old man into your victories and losses. People respect you in this locality. People want you to....- -Let that be it. The ones who respect me will get divided... ...into two groups after the vote. Hari...- -Yes, Master? Asking me to stand for the Panchayart elections! The party is doing its job, right? The village roads have been pitched. 21 ponds have been fringed. 8 parks have been made for children. 3 community halls, a health centre, A small hospital is being made beside the station, isn't it? Work is getting done. Yes. Work is getting done. But can you build some morals too, along with these things? So that tomorrow,those kids from the parks... ...can walk on the pitched roads with their heads held high? Can you? I understand. But I think if you become the chairman, we could do something with this hall.- -Keep me out of this. I'll make huge promises asking for vote, then someone from the crowd will get up and say, my son is a thief. They'll say your son is selling pirated DVDs in the locality. He's selling tickets and holding screenings illegally. Then what? That's only a fair.- -So? What'll happen when the police get's him? Don't worry about that, I'll take care of it. Yes, I'll take care of that. You'll take care of it? Wow. Want some? No. I'll take your leave today. See you. Hey, Sudhangshu... don't be pissed with me. This politics... it's a very tough business. The kite thinks it's flying, the string thinks it's flying the kite, the spool thinks it's operating the string, but actually, the kite is flown by that person, the one with the spool in his hand. See you. Don't be pissed with me, son. Eight hundred and... one hundred. Give me! This is the just the beginning, Mou. Know what Ashim da was saying? He was saying, it is our baby who is lucky. See, it all came to me the day I got the news. Here, keep these in the locker. Be careful. Baba is not back yet. It's nearly 11pm. Will you go ahead and check once? No. Though Hari da is there with him. Drinking as usual! Hari came to the fair today to see the crowd. The employee is going free, drinking away in sorrow. How dare he returns the food! Why did you ask the price?- -I bloody well did! None of you two, father and son can control your temper. Here, keep these in the locker too. It's been 2 months since the ice-cream soda factory closed down. I went to check the shade. I'll open a video hall there after the fair gets over. Some repairing is required though. But that'll require a lot of money. Not much, managable. Where'll you get it? I'll steal, Mrs. Moumita Das; I will steal! Silly girl, there'll be quite an amount coming in from the fair. Listen, tell me if you need to, my father will send it if I ask him to. I won't need it. This machine will arrange for everything now. Listen, it's your responsibility, you're home all day... ...take care no one touches the machine. No one. Okay. Not even Baba. HOUSEFUL TICKET COUNTER RS. 20 FOR CHAIR They're drawing a nice crowd, Master. Saw the 'Housefull' board outside? Housefull with five rupees tickets? Switch on the torch. Laughing, Master? Blood. This is blood, Hari. That swine could not think of any other business. Rascal, you too became a cinemawala in the end. A fraud one. But a cinemawala, nonetheless. Cinemawala! I don't lose temper without a reason. He can't be right always because he's my father! He's got no sense. Mr. Sudhangshu from the political party? He went to meet Baba at his office. Baba told him, "Stop the illegal screenings at the fair." How does it feel? Mr. Sudhangshu got a chance to pass a snide remark at me. "Your father says these illegal screenings wil get you in trouble!" Isn't he playing over-smart now? He's betraying me. He did the same thing with Ma. Good, she left him. Educated woman from the city. Why'd she take the insult? All Baba wants is... give me a little. All Baba wants is, I too follow him like Hari da. This is business, everyone's getting a share. The cops will get me eh? No free lunches here. Whatever little respect I had, he's ruined that too now. I've made the sweets, for free. I'll take the bowls later. Hari... Hari... Hari... It's getting late, what the hell happens to him sometimes! Hari... God! Rascal! Hari... ...won't you go? Mr. Nabin called pretty late in the night yesterday. Said he'll pick them up early in the dawn. The matadoor will be here any moment. I've checked. Still a champion, this. Let me clean them up a bit, going to a new house. Please manage the fish market alone today, Master. I came into this room when I was twenty-three. Let me stay back a while. There. They're here. Hari... I'll come back later. Don't leave, I've to speak to you. What is it?- -How do I know? Come. Sold off the projectors. For very cheap. Mr. Nabin bought them. You've been insisting on promotery for a long time. Not till I live. Till I live, let the Kamalini Hall stay. Do what you wish to after that, I'll not come to stop you. Fisherman! I inherited being a 'fisherman' from my father, as in your grandpa. And you got it from me. No business is demeaning. If it is unfeigned. You're looking for a short-cut. Your child will grow up knowing that his father sells fake DVDs. That's how he runs his household. That'll earn you your respect? A father calls his son a thief in front of people, what could be more insulting? Wait, let me finish, then you can speak. Go ahead. My father never wanted me to make a cinema hall. Producer, director, exhibitor... ...all this was an unknown language for him. But I was determined to make a hall! I explained to him from the perspective of a fisherman. The producer's pond, the director's fish net, he gets good fish for the distributer, at a wholesale rate, like we do. The exhibitor buys it from him, in wholesale price, and sells it to people in the market, in the cinema hall. You could not explain it to me, your stubborness, your arrogance, you showed me a different business. The people who invested in the pond, the fishnet, the fishing, you won't give them a penny back? On the other hand, you're ruining the business of cinema. You're getting away with it now. Later, when the police will come and close you down, what will happen to the reputation of our Das family? Why are you laughing? The cops, Mr. Sudhangshu, you don't need to bother about them. Since their father wasn't Pranabendu Das, they're not so high on morals. Anything else? The Hall's papers, the bank's documents, LIC, NSC... and everything else, it's all written in this notebook, with the dates. Take it. Are you luring me with your property? Don't. Give me time, I'll find a shelter for myself too. I don't wish to live as your employee or tenant. Came up with sincere ways of reopening Kamalini hall. You rejected. Told you a thousand times, renovate it to a modern design. How much would it take? You can invest on tons of things, but you cannot listen to my advice. I've not opened up a new business for no reason. And if that business is mendacious, you're to be blamed too. You stay with your hall, your house and the fish market, don't drag me in. And if I ever hear that you've spoken nonsense about me, I swear I'll burn this house down! Listen... ...there's a cop outside, calling you. Wow. Bravo! Yes, what is it? Please call Mr. Pranab. He's coming. One minute. Baba, the police is looking for you. Yes, tell me. You've to come to the hall with me, Sir. Why?- -Mr. Hari? Yes?- -He has committed suicide. What! Hari is no more! Hari... Come, Sir. Come with me. Subal, who works for you at the fish market? ...he went to hall to submit the bills, he found out. We have our very own son of Bengal, Dev, the evergreen Prosenjit, along with Jeet and the great Mithun! May his soul rest in peace. May his soul rest in peace. May his soul rest in peace. May his soul rest in peace. Crystal clear picture and... ...your favourite songs on the modern sound system! Baba... Baba! Baba! Baba! Baba, open the gate! Fire! Fire! Fire! Master... Master... ...come inside. What are you thinking? Baba! (indistinct chattering) What are looking for? Over here, come here. Come on, come fast! Why are you thinking so much, Master? The crowd will break in! Kanu has hung the 'Housefull' board. But they're not listening! Come fast! Come on, quick! Come fast! Come on. Mind your steps. Come. Careful, come. Let's go. Let's go, Master, the sun is about to set. Let's go as far as we can.
