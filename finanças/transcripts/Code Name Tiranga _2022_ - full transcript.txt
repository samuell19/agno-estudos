They say that the tale of life begins before you are born. Life comes to an end… But… The tale continues. The battle of survival… Asks for sacrifice. And there are… Two kinds of warriors in this battle. Ones who are allowed to survive. And the other… Who challenge death and survive in the end. The wounds received in love and war… Never heal. Even my life is a plethora of wounds. I don't know which wounds I got in battle… And which ones in love. I've survived with these wounds… And this story… Is about how I fought and survived. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Take me to the main market. - Sorry. I thought I called for it. - Oh! Sorry. My Pashto is not that good. Sorry. Which way are you heading? Do you know English? Yes, I do. I'm going to the main market. Oh… I'm also going the same way. Can I drop you off? Or… You can drop me off. Sure. Okay. That's a long list. Grocery. So much? For how many people? No, this is just for me. Just for you... What the... He's such a glutton. You speak Hindi. You can speak Hindi?! Are you Indian? I'm a Turkish citizen… But my mom was from Punjab. Okay. Even my family is from Punjab. I'm Ismat. - Dr. Mirza Ali. - Hi. So, what are you doing in Afghanistan? I live in Turkey, but I've come here for a United Nations program. Wow! Okay. But what are you doing in Afghanistan? My story isn't as cool as yours. Clichéd story. My relatives in India were forcing me to get married. It made me uncomfortable. I got an assignment out here, and I jumped to it. What do you do? I'm a journalist. I work for the Times. Well, it's a good thing. Your decision to not get married, allowed me to meet an Indian in Afghanistan. True. Just to be clear… I didn't have a problem with marriage. It was the relatives. Besides, all the boys they were showing me… I don't like Punjabi boys. Why? Even I'm half Punjabi. What's wrong with me? Okay. If someday… I'm compelled to marry you… I'll think about it. Okay? I feel strange saying this, but… I wonder what I'm doing here. Let me assure you that you won't bump into any of your relatives here. This band plays music from different countries and languages. They might play my request as well. Come. Come, sweetheart Say yes to me Come, sweetheart Hold my hand Come, sweetheart Say yes to me Where did you learn that? My father was in the military. He taught me when I was very young. It's called Morse code. I want to learn it as well. Will you teach me? Of course. My tenure with the UN will be over soon. I'll return to Turkey after that. I dream of opening my clinic. Maybe I can fulfill it. Take your first step with faith. And your dreams… Shall kiss your feet. Mirza, wherever you go… Or whatever you do… My prayers shall always be with you. And my heart will always regret… Wishing you could come along with your prayers. What do you mean? The verses of the Quran are written on this talisman, Ismat. - If you... - Don't try to confuse me. Will you be my beloved wife? I've fallen in love for the first time - Tell me what do I do? - What do I do? -I can't control my heart -My love! - Tell me what do I do? - What do I do? -I've fallen in love for the first time -My love! - Tell me what do I do? - What do I do? -You've stolen my slumber -My love! Tell me what do I do? My love My sweetheart We've just crossed the border. Now entering Afghanistan. Sky Ranger to Alpha 1, do you copy? Sky Ranger to Alpha 1, do you copy? Do you copy, Alpha 1? Are you good? Greetings, Dr. Mirza Ali! Greetings. How are you? Please don't stand in the queue. That is for the guests. You are family. Don't you think we should've had a wedding like this? We got married but no one came to know about it. You should be grateful I agreed to marry you. There's a tradition in my family. After 25 years of marriage, you need to renew your vows. Oh! I've already booked a date for us. Can you live with me for 25 years? Do you doubt it? Dr. Mirza Ali gives you his word that he'll breathe his last in your arms. I love you. And I can die in love for you. Sky Ranger to Alpha 1. Sky Ranger to Alpha 1. Alpha 1, come in. Alpha 1, come in. Sir, the coordinates were sent from here. Do you think Alpha 1 is compromised?

Maybe… - I'll come along. - No. You must stay. I… Look at Shehzad. He's so happy. He attended our wedding. You should stay for his wedding. I'll manage. Brother Mirza, Shehzad is waiting for you. You must show your talent today, Brother Mirza. Took me a lifetime to earn a reputation. Don't make me lose it all here. No excuses today. Either you sing, or you don't go home. You decide.

We weren't getting any response from you. - What to do? I had no choice. - Okay. What's hidden in my heart? Where are the guns? You know it all I hope Dr. Mirza doesn't know what his wife Ismat is planning. You know it all Right, Durga? You're above destiny Did you do anything foolish? You're above destiny There's no one You're afraid that I've betrayed you. Don't worry. He has no idea. You met Mirza two months ago. And we've been trying to trace this man for 20 years. We never saw him again after the Parliament Attack in 2001. Do you understand? Sir… Either we kill Omar today… Or die trying. You rule every heart You rule But the truth is we've manipulated an innocent civilian. Even the moon, the sun, the stars claim Everyone else is a speck of dust You're the emperor All hail the great one Even the moon, the sun, the stars claim All hail the great one Even the moon, the sun, the stars claim Stop!

Copy that. Glory to Him Glory to Him One who swayed In Your abundance Has witnessed paradise Destiny smiled on him Oh, shit! We're exposed! Now! - Shehzad! - Shehzad! Shehzad! Shehzad! - Are you okay, sir? - I'm okay. Durga! Omar! Shehzad! Don't lose him! Go! Omar. Kneel. Come on, Durga. Get in. Durga, this was a trap! We've been exposed, Durga. Let's go. I always suspected that he was involved. Alright, keep me updated. Bastard! Our source at the Turkish Embassy spotted him two days ago. We've been tracking his movement ever since. Sir, I have some information for you. Look at what we've got. Khalid Omar is hiding in Turkey. That makes my information much more important. I'm taking a big risk meeting you. I hope I'll be rewarded equally well for it. Did you bring the money and the passport? I need the information first. That's Abu Musib. Senior Member, Al-Qaeda, Iran. - And with him is… - Bakshi! Sirajuddin Al Has an, senior member, Al-Qaeda, Afghanistan. He's pretty close to Omar Khalid. Are you trying to say that… One of our best agents has gone rogue? I told you that Afghanistan Mission is just the beginning, not the end. Bakshi was the mole all along. - Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind. Does Bakshi know you're tailing him? No, sir. He has no idea yet. What's the update? Guess who Bakshi is with right now? Khalid Omar's old handler. Abu Haqqani? Yes, sir. He planned the Parliament attack with Omar. We have to know what Bakshi is up to. Where are they? They are at the cyber cafe which RAW agents use to send classified information. Let me call you back. Okay, sir. We have to wait. - Get back! - What happened? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hey! Just get rid of him! It's been 20 years since I infiltrated your parliament. For how long will RAW keep wasting their money and time on me? RAW would know that. Let them go. They came here for me. Not you. Then killing them would be disgraceful. My father used to say that… When a helpless man raises his voice… The world disgusts him. But when he picks up… The gun instead… It's called terrorism. My men died at the wedding because of RAW. This is a small price in exchange. - Let them go. - Look here. - Omar, let them go. - Look. I said look! Look! I don't work for RAW anymore, Omar. Find out yourself. It's not a big deal for you. But… I can be useful to you. Much more than you can imagine. I know you're a traitor. What are traitors called in India? Vibhishan. Jaichand. Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar. Greetings. We can't discuss this on the phone. Come over. Your Indian souvenir… Is safe with me. Come soon. Goodbye. You were right, Bakshi. People are willing to pay a good price in exchange for you. Can I get a cigarette? He's our third RAW agent who's been turned in ten years. All for money. What's ISI General Iftekhar Khan doing in Turkey? Khan has been there since the Paris attacks in 2017. He's been running all his operations from there. We have intel that Khalid Omar… Is going to barter Ajay Bakshi with the ISI. A senior ex-RAW agent like him isn't short of a goldmine for the ISI. So what now? Eliminate Ajay Bakshi. Before the ISI can get to him. You'll need your best man for the job. The sooner you cooperate… The sooner I will leave your house. You've played enough. My turn now. It's mine. Get your phone. Please be quiet! I am a doctor. I save people's lives. Now save yourself from being held up in a police station. Tell me the truth. He came to me the night before with a minor injury. Later when I treated him, he insisted to stay. I agreed as he paid me a decent amount. I just treated him. You see the money was more than enough for us to sustain for a month. Give it to me now. It's my turn. What's the matter, boys? You don't like the game? We can't open the lock of the phone. You can ask your father. It's not his phone. It's mine. I found it. If it's not your phone… Then whose phone is it? Mobile. Mobile. Password. Jai Hind, sir. Durga, I've news for you. We've located Ajay Bakshi. Khalid Omar's got him. What? - Are you sure, sir? - Yes. We've got visual confirmation from Gaziantep field agents. Khalid Omar's men ambushed Bakshi and Haqqani. Ajay Bakshi has been taken hostage. But… What does Khalid Omar need from a rogue Indian agent? Look, Bakshi knows far too much about us. If he opens his mouth, the entire Middle East setup will be compromised. Every asset will be exposed. So, Durga, you have a job to do. I'm listening, sir. Eliminate Ajay Bakshi! This has to be an in-and-out job. You have only 48 hours to complete your mission. As soon as you land in Turkey, you'll meet with an agent for ground support. He's been in Turkey for several years. And the mission's code name will be "Tiranga." Jai Hind. Jai Hind. Kabir Ali. Welcome to Gaziantep. This is where Khalid Omar lives with his family. Ajay Bakshi's probably here as well. There's a control room we've access to. But we can't get in from there. The area's secluded from the crowd. Security… Very tight! What's the plan? A female teacher teaches Urdu to Khalid Omar's wife. She's been with them for several years. She's the only outsider who… Can enter their house without a security check. Can I help? Can I drop you home? Come. I just need… Answers to… The questions I ask. The basement can be accessed from the tunnels. It's possible that Bakshi is in this basement. Now we'll get the answers. We have a team of six armed commandos. - Okay? - Where? There! They are over there. Or do I have to work harder? Come. Please. Allow me. Here you go. Thank you. Allow me to introduce you. General Iftikar Khan. Our special ally in Pakistan. Greetings. Sit down. First, let me feed you, then I'll eat. Don't be so cruel to me. It's a request. Sit. Amazing. Honestly, the food is… Delicious. I'm obliged for your hospitality. Thank you. You have… Shown us great generosity… By handing over the Indian agent. Our General will be quite pleased. Our Jihad is connected to the same cause. But now this cause needs money. Arrange for the money… And you can take the Indian spy wherever you like. Help! Hello. May I check your bag? Stop. You were told yesterday… That today's class is canceled. Then why are you here? Why are you here? Come on. Answer me! Why are you here? What's the matter? Are you deaf?! Is this a joke? Do I need to arrest you? My brother is not well. I've come to take his salary. That's why I am here. Call the house and check if this is true. - Hurry. - Okay. I wonder when I'll get to taste such delicious food again. If there's love for the one you cook for… Every dish turns out to be delicious. Excuse me. What is taking so long?! No one is answering the call. Keep trying! What's the matter? No one's answering. All of you are good for nothing. Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello. The teacher is here at the gate. Should we let her in? Yes. Please send her immediately. We were expecting her. Yes. Right away. Hello. Let her go. You can go. Go! Level one, cleared. That was close. Remember Kulbhushan? The Indian spy who was caught in Pakistan. The truth was that he was never in Pakistan. The Iranian intelligence… Arrested him in Iran. We made a deal with Iran… And brought him to Pakistan. To show the world that… He was spying in Pakistan. To disgrace and shame India. And you guys want to do it all over again. What is wrong with you? Are you still mad at me? I am sorry. I love you, Ferozi. You're smelling different today. Who are you? Who the hell are you? Leave me. Kabir, I'm exposed. What?! If you keep feeding me like this, I'll gain weight. And you know how important it is for a soldier to stay fit. A soldier should watch what he's eating, but not the husband. Take the Indian agent out of the basement. Now! Omar! Meryem. It's okay. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. Omar, we should get out of her. Let's go. Come on. Omar… Meryem… just a little longer. Breathe. Keep breathing. Drive faster! Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Keep your eyes open, Meryem. We will be there. We are almost there. Meryem… Please breathe. Durga. The time has come. You're a soldier. Follow your orders. Shoot me. Don't you dare call the cops! You think that's him? That could be the Taliban as well. After all, it's their land of action. - Jai Hind, sir! - Jai Hind, sir! Whatever you guys have, it better be good. Two months later, there's a wedding at the Mazhar-e-Sharif. It's Shehzad Ali and Sadia Mansour's wedding. I've never heard these names before. Sir, it's probably because they are ordinary civilians. So then, why are they important to us? They are important, sir. Because their wedding will be attended by the man we've been looking for since 2001. Khalid Omar. If this info is correct… It'll be like finding a scorpion in a desert. Sir. But how will you infiltrate the function? If Omar is coming, he'll be deploying heavy security as well. Sir. - Sir, this is Dr. Mirza Ali. - Okay. He supervises the UN's Refugees and Migrants response program in Kabul. - So, he's on the guest list. - Yes, sir. He's quite popular among local tribal people. - He's also partly Indian. - Yeah. So infiltrating the function under his cover will be easier. Good, who found him? Sir. So far so good. What's the plan? Sir, that… I'm figuring out, sir. Then figure it out fast. Of course, sir. To the main market. - Sorry… I thought I called for it. - Oh! Sorry. My Pashto is not that good. I hope Dr. Mirza doesn't know what his wife Ismat is planning. We have manipulated an innocent civilian. Your stitches will open up. How are you? So, you did open your clinic. Mirza… Even a lifetime of apology… Won't make up for the mistakes I made in those two months. Apologies are for mistakes one makes. You had it planned all along. At least tell me your real name. Durga! Omar. Amen. I want to share your pain… But I'm at a loss for words. No words can describe the pain of Meryem's demise. My son can never forgive me, Khan. He lost his mother… Because of me. What's her name? Durga Singh. Special Ops. RAW. How long will… The injuries take to heal? Depends on the person. You're a trained agent. Your wounds might heal faster. I'll have to stitch it again. Mirza. I'll always be sorry for whatever happened. There's a lot I wanted to tell you, Mirza. But I didn't have time back then. And now I don't have time. Mirza. Find this car. She couldn't have gone too far in her state. I didn't get shot for the first time… But it's never been so painful. We cannot go back in time, Durga. And your remorse cannot… Change your reality. Then I had two choices. I could've betrayed my country… Or you. We cannot go back in time… But we can change its outcome. I want to spend my time with you. Not as Ismat… But as Durga. It's bleeding again. I'll have to change your stitches. I have a deal for you. It can save your agent's life. You want to save an Indian. You're definitely in a tough spot. Tough and easy are just illusions created by the mind, Kabir. Hand over Durga to me. I promise… she will stay alive. If Omar gets to her first… Then she will suffer to death. Your hair's turning gray. It's called aging. Are you sad? Not at all. Not everyone's lucky to grow old. Wait. - What happened? - Mirza, where's my gun? But what happened? Mirza, where's my gun? It's in the drawer. But what happened? - Any other way out of here? - No. But there's a basement. Ready? One more. They will come back. For me. Mirza. We met again because destiny wanted to give me a second chance… To apologize to you. You know the truth. I've chosen this life. Living alone… Won't be easy. But if anything happens to you… Because of me… I won't be able to live. The entire country prays to "Lord Durga" for protection. You are Durga as well. You fear that you might be responsible for my death. But I would hate to die if at that moment you're not with me. How can you trust Mirza, Durga? You deceived him the last time. Yes sir, I know, but... No. You'll have to come to Kill is alone. A cargo plane at the Kill is air base will take you to Ankara. From there you'll fly to India. Sir, either he comes with me to India… Or you can relieve me. How many bullets were shot at you? Two. Traitor. He's here. - What do we do? - Call the police. Go! Jai Hind, sir. - Where is Mirza? - He's safe. We've to hold them off until the police arrive. Police. Who called the police? No other option. How many rounds do you have left? About three to you. And you? Not more than seven or eight. Mirza! Go back! Mirza, go back! I am here. Until I spill Durga's blood over Meryem's tomb… She won't get justice. His life can be spared. I want Durga Singh in exchange. Within 24 hours. Durga, you should see this. His life can be spared. I want Durga Singh in exchange. Within 24 hours. I want Durga Singh in exchange. Within 24 hours. The decision is yours. Are you sure about this? Except for Omar… There's another guy… Who will benefit from my surrender. That's our bait. Traitor. Jai Hindi, sir. Why didn't Durga make it to Kill is? Durga has surrendered. What? Sir, things are getting complicated. I think you should come. Okay, I am coming. Where is Durga? You want Durga… Because you want another Indian scapegoat. We still remember Kulbhushan, Mr. Khan. Khalid Omar is a despicable person. Are you not, Mr. Khan? Pledge your loyalty to me. It's a better deal. Is it a deal… Or a threat? You're an old player. Why let yourself be used as a pawn… In someone else's conflict? It doesn't matter who wins it. In the end, it's you who has to die. Kabir. Where is Durga? Rascal. You feasted with me in my home, Khan. Yes. I'm a loyal servant of my country. We're fighting a war as well, Omar. You don't have to worry about the war, Khan. Because there's only… Peace after death. Killing me would mean… Challenging the ISI unnecessarily. Give us Durga. Turkish Police will let you go. Jai Hind, sir. Jai Hind. The plan worked. How were you so sure… Before you surrendered… That Omar will take you to his wife's tomb? His life can be spared. I want Durga Singh in exchange. In 24 hours. Until I don't spill her blood on Meryem's tomb… My love won't get justice. The decision is yours. Are you sure about this? Other than Omar… There's only one other guy who will benefit from my surrender. That's our bait. Where is Durga? We can't do this alone, Durga. We'll need RAW's help. Do you remember the Afghanistan Mission? It was a suicide mission for you… Because Ajay Bakshi, a member of your team, was a mole. Yet he got shot. Did you kill the wrong guy? Ajay Bakshi… Is alive. I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Mirza. Mirza. Okay, I know… you've been through a lot for us. It was our war but… We risked your life. I know. But… I am sorry, I promise… This will be the last time. - Mirza, I… - No. Why… Mirza, everything is okay now. Everything is fine. We… we can grow old together. - We… - Stay away. I told you, Durga, not everyone's lucky to grow old. Why? What… Mirza, we… We can choose our life now. - Please… - No. We don't choose life, but life chooses us. What… No! Mirza! You're no longer here But your memory is still around Even my soul's crying for you You're no longer here But your memory is still around Even my soul's crying for you Since we got separated Since we got separated You took my heart along My beloved Sweet beloved You gave me a lifetime of sorrow My beloved Sweet beloved You gave me a lifetime of sorrow I'm left back on this land While you turned into a star It's become difficult To live with this separation The desires I had with you The desires I had with you Are left unfulfilled My beloved Sweet beloved You gave me a lifetime of sorrow My beloved Sweet beloved You gave me a lifetime of sorrow This night that's upon us It is full Of bane Has snatched my destiny Leaving my hands empty Since we got separated Since we got separated You took my heart along My beloved Sweet beloved You gave me a lifetime of sorrow My beloved Sweet beloved You gave me a lifetime of sorrow My beloved Sweet beloved You gave me a lifetime of sorrow Where are you, Kabir? My team will meet you at the parking area, sir. I'll see you later. Alright, meet me at the safe house. ASAP. Jai Hind, sir. Jai Hind, sir. Jai Hind, sir. Jai Hind. Jai Hind, sir. Greetings. Delhi knows you'll attend a wedding, at Mazhar-e-Sharif. They plan to capture you there. Who is speaking? You have only one friend in Delhi. What is all this? What did you think, sir? This was your game. You're the only one making the moves. We all could've died in Afghanistan. Because of you. That's why you didn't kill him. No, sir. For a moment I thought she will really kill me. Shoot. Are you okay, Durga? The asset I was chasing, died in a car crash. But… I found his phone, sir. What's so special about this phone? I think there's a mole in RAW. We already knew RAW's team would be waiting for us at the wedding. There's someone in RAW who is following Omar's orders. Do you have any proof? Haqqani gave me all the information, and coordinates to me, of the handler you were chasing. Get your hands on this phone and you'll learn all the secrets. I cannot meet you. RAW is tracking me. You'll be exposed as well. The rest of the information will be delivered through a secret server. Decode the message if you want to follow the instructions. Call me as soon as you get the asset. Yes, sir. - Did you tell Mr. Goel? - No. No. I want to be more sure about it. Omar got a call on the phone of the asset Durga was chasing. The call originated from RAW Chief, Ranjit Kapur's office. How did you find out that Ranjit Kapur is not the mole? The day Omar received the call… Ranjit Kapur was on a leave. And only one other guy has access to that room. He called from Ranjit Kapur's office because he knew if the call is traced, then Mr. Kapur would land in a dilemma. Which means he can replace him as the Chief of RAW. Hello. Delhi knows you'll attend a wedding at Mazhar-e-Sharif. They plan to capture you there. Who is speaking? You have only one friend in Delhi. My intel was right. If that man hadn't alerted Omar on that day… We could've captured him at the wedding. Two of his agents… In Gaziantep had informed him… That you're meeting with Haqqani. Or maybe Haqqani has some information for Bakshi. Let me call you back. Haqqani had already defected Omar. And he was scared… If Haqqani has any kind of information about Omar's source in RAW, then he will get to you. That's why he called Omar. I'm sending you their location. I want revenge from Haqqani for defecting me. Consider it done. He thought Omar would be more loyal to him. But sadly, for him… Omar has always been… More loyal to Pakistan. We can't discuss these things on the phone. Come home. Until then your Indian souvenir… Is safe with me. You were right, Bakshi. People are willing to pay a good price for you. Actually, this is our third RAW agent… In ten years who turned out to be a traitor. And that too money. So what now? Eliminate Ajay Bakshi. It's Spycraft's cardinal rule, sir. If you can't change the course of the wind… Then change the course of your boat. I would suggest you, sir… Record your confession. This boat will take you… to the cargo ship. You two will travel to Bahrain. Contact Delhi after reaching Bahrain. They will extract you. And take special care of him till Bahrain. Delhi will do the rest. Kabir. So… You're not coming? You know my answer, sir. How will you get to Omar? They had you blindfolded. How will you go back? Let's start. This is it. O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee Rich with hurrying streams Bright with orchard gleams Cool with winds of delight Rich with hurrying streams Bright with orchard gleams Cool with winds of delight Dark fields waving Mother of might O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee I want to be overwhelmed by your love I'll die if you're not with me I want to be overwhelmed by your love I'll die if you're not with me Those streets and alleys Those monsoon seasons In every lifetime We seek your refuge The love I feel for you I feel for no one else O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee Rich with hurrying streams Bright with orchard gleams Cool with winds of delight Rich with hurrying streams Bright with orchard gleams Cool with winds of delight Dark fields waving Mother of might O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee Glory of moonlight dreams Over thy branches and lordly streams Clad in thy blossoming trees Laughing low and sweet Speaker sweet and low Mother, giver of ease Mother, I kiss thy feet O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother, I bow to thee O Mother O Mother, I bow to thee They say the tale of life begins before you are born. Life ends but… The tale of life continues. The battle of survival… Asks for sacrifice. And there are two kinds of warriors in this battle. One, who is allowed to survive. And the other… Who challenge death and survive in the end. The wounds received in love and war, never heal. Even my life is a plethora of wounds. I don't know which wounds I got in battle… And which ones in love. The ones whom we love… Never leave us. The pain of losing Mirza… Is the price of meeting him. They say… life begins under water… And ends in flames. These flames made me realize… That Mirza exists… In my ashes as well. But those flames didn't kill me. It gave me a new life. Durga is a form… That every woman takes… To fulfill unfinished businesses and to make the wrong things right. I am one of those women. And whenever… The tricolor is in danger, I will come back. Because I am Durga. Crossing the border and entering Saudi. Sky Ranger to Alpha 1. Do you copy? Thirty seconds to go. Stay tight. Sky Ranger to Alpha 1. Do you copy? Do you copy, Alpha 1?
