Flashy editing, familiar to cable viewers. But watch out, there are stowaways. I am a simple mortal who one day found himself in a video studio. I applied to a television competition. My actual job is to present, but I do other things as well. I am a presenter and an administrator. There are 6 of us. I am a presenter. Everyone who works at the video commune is a Bosnian refugee. They are young people who never imagined that one day they'd be behind a television camera, or holding a microphone. The first thing that struck me was that people were closed in, not only inside four walls, but inside themselves. There was no information at all from outside. And thus came the idea of producing a news show. TV NEWS IN THE CAMPS When they left their Slovenia barracks, the Yugoslav federal army methodically broke everything they left behind, an old habit of theirs. They left one symbol behind. A map of former Yugoslavia with a hole in the place of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosnian refugees of the Roska camp live in these barracks. How? Nothing could be simpler. By pirating satellite programs. For Sarajevo and Mostar, there are 3 or 4 sources. Radio, CNN, Sky, so we can compare. It is difficult to judge which is the most truthful. That's not our job anyway. We just give the three reports. Then people can ask themselves some questions. Who wants to lie? And who wants to lie, but can't? We get CNN, Sky News, and Radio Sarajevo. They might give the same information. You've got to ask how objective they really are. Compared to Croatian and Serbian television, I think we are objective. From 1980 on, the Belgrade news always started with Kosovo. Some pieces were absurd: "Albanian cow craps on Serbian cemetery". When we started doing reportage, I began watching television with different eyes. I understood that it was all one big manipulation. We try to remain true to ourselves: A television for the interior. We attempt not to be too perverted. You think about television differently once you learn how it works. I've changed as well. It is not what we thought it was. I used to watch the news for sports and the weather, not for culture. We were complete technical laymen. My job is to sort through the Radio Sarajevo news. Sustained fire from the aggressors... The channels are picked up by satellite. A small video setup donated by Cause Commune provides the basis to collect info. Then comes the organization phase in the "newsroom". We'll add that. I don't know what to add. It depends on how the news is received. We always try to tell the truth, but if it is inconvenient, for them it is a lie. Once a week, the team visits a room in the camp for a special report. The first step is to establish confidence and to listen. No film camera to start with, but soon it is accepted. Video has become part of daily life. In this room, the family explains that their departure was filmed. They promise to bring the tape. The Serbs put on their uniforms in their trucks. We must establish normal relationships with them. If there's trust, they'll open their hearts. I think we succeed because we're all in the same situation. On both sides, for those who film and those who talk, these stories reveal an acute need to communicate, and a feeling that they're recording their own memories. Another team works directly on the camp's memory. No organized schedule here. They gather raw material that will later take shape. We want to hold on to this moment. The memorial part of the project is based on that. How to keep hold of a moment for a time yet to come. Many things we've gone through are not recorded. People are not aware of them. We visit the camps and record how people are living there. Here is one of those episodes, filmed and edited by the refugees themselves. Detailed close-ups, the kind usually used to fill gaps between scenes. The details show how people are living. Everything in the room has its value. A doll, a dirty old sock, a little coffee stove. Everything has its value. We see ourselves there. We see what we had in our homes. Things have sentimental value. It's from the heart. We want to show that we had something once. Details are important: They represent life. The rest depends on the editing. It's our night-time work. It is not physically demanding, but it's demanding psychologically. What sees us through is our love for these people. You decide which one is more handsome. While Suad tames the room tenants, Nihad and Indira record the news bulletin. Tonight on the news. Another massacre in Sarajevo. Situation on other fronts. Earthquake in Japan. Nine dead in Johannesburg. You are watching the Refugees News Program. Is the lighting good? When my patients got anxious, I sang to them. They thought I was crazy. To be a refugee? I wouldn't wish it on anyone. A neighbor, curious about the filming. She tells the same old story: How it all started. Her brother had just moved to a new building. Then, the shelling started. It made a big hole. Suad knows the district. He's lived there. I was studying stomatology. In the miserable year of 1992, I was in my fourth year. I was in Sarajevo for the first barricades. By chance, I had gone back home for the weekend. I had to join the army. And when you... ran away? No. Deserted. I was studying in Sarajevo. I didn't want to fight. Suad and Nihad are brothers. They have a special status. They deserted from the Serbian army and came here to help. I had three brothers. One is dead. Mommy, she's crying. I don't want anybody to be a refugee. I wish the word did not exist. My brother's son... - lost his leg. - Wait for the camera. He wants me to wait. Relax. This is not an interrogation. At night, I often dream of my house, but it's not exactly my house. It is a picture of a house, and I pretend it is my house. The kid kept saying: He's not dead. It's good here. We're not being shot at. We have a roof over our heads. The food is not very good, but we manage. My sons were fighting. 40 days after us, they retreated to Brod. My second son died in Brod. We went to the funeral on the ninth day of the seventh month. We buried him in Brod, and went back to Ljubljana. 3 days later, my mother died. I buried her 3 days after she died. I have a big family. I have many siblings. I have 5 brothers and 4 sisters. I only know where some of them are. It is difficult to be away from home, far from your people. I am all alone. Very often, I think about my life. My future here does not look too bright. In fact, at the moment, I have no future. You turn up somewhere where people see you as a nobody, a complete zero. You'll get help, but not from the heart. A package with a few tin cans. You can wander about as you wish in town because you have a refugee card. But if you speak this damn Bosnian language, you'll get stopped. If you have a bicycle, they'll check if it is yours. A leather jacket? The same. You start feeling like a dog of a special breed. Though really we're all the same. A visit from Dino, from the Memory group. I go to the center and talk to my fellow Bosnians. They're not intellectuals. They're normal people who work the land. I feel sick and happy at the same time because I recorded this suffering, and someone else can see it too. Will that happen? It is probably too good to be true. Most of us have given up hope that the day will come when we can explain in peace that we were witnesses to something that finally ended, that is over. You'd have had to live in Bosnia to understand the extent of destruction. Not just material destruction. Internal destruction too. With all these people that were killed, our memory has been lost. Our habits are lost, our mores, our way of life, our smells, our songs, our books, the tunes we loved.. I used to think about people, but I no longer do, because they are all gone. What remains are the forests, the mountains, the rivers. At first, I did not think this could happen. When it started elsewhere, we thought it would be different here. We're all together. It can't happen to us. When we saw what happened in Bucharest, we said: "That's Romania", "Yugoslavia is different". It is so easy for Slovenians and Croats to ask how we could have not known. We did know. On the evening of April 5 last year, I did not think they'd be a war in Sarajevo. I did not know. When it started in Yugoslavia, and the worst happened in Bosnia, we were trapped, because we lived together, oblivious to nationality. I was never a witness, not once in my life, to the animosities you're talking about, and yet they existed. I was not conscious of them. I've never experienced it. My own existence had never been put into question. We should have prepared ourselves. Personally, because I was never aware of it, I was living with my eyes closed. Life was lovely behind my closed eyes. People have a particular model of television in their heads, so we had to make the news look like the news, make it look like what people are used to seeing, to make it credible. We should look into our... our... This film contains a lie in its title. Here, the eight o'clock news are on at seven o'clock. Sometimes the screening room is crowded. Sometimes the mood is too gloomy to pay attention to television. It's a fragile experience. It's a unique experience. Earthquake in Japan. 9 dead in Johannesburg. You are watching the Refugees News Program. Hello, I am Indira. And I'm Nihad. Now, the news. General Morillon departs. French minister Juppe calls for the protection of security zones for protection of the arms embargo. Thursday night: Special reportage. The cave of sadness gapes inside me. I can't find my rhymes. My eyes only see Sarajevo. Young people who work in TV in the world... They have not seen us yet, but I hope they will. I hope they'll see our program. My message to journalists, young and old, is to live in peace, to be objective, avoid manipulation. Be more objective, avoid manipulation. Spread a propaganda of love, freedom, and peace. I'd like to send my good wishes to all refugees of the world. May they listen, and hold on. One day we'll go back to our land. I'm not only thinking of Bosnians. May we all return to the place we were born. The only message I'd like to give is to love one another. That's not only for people who work in TV. On the wall, between the working tools and the symbols, they stuck up a poster: Einstein was a refugee. The Roska Camp Video Workshop, 1993. SUBTITLES BY KANAFANI
