This reconstruction of Carl Th. Dreyer's movie Water from the land from 1946 is made on the basis of a gallery of stills and unedited audio recordings. Water from the land - Tell me, Mr engineer, where do water come from? - From the sky. - I thought it came from the ground. - No. Water comes from the sky. - But how? - Water soaks down into the ground and is later pumped back up. - Sorry, I do not get it. - It is not so difficult. - Water soaks into the ground until it reaches an impermeable layer of soil. Here it remains. This layer of water is called the groundwater. - I see. But then the water must be very dirty after soaking through the soil? - I figured you would not understand. Groundwater is very pure and germ-free. - I do not get it. - I will explain. As rainwater soaks down it is filtered such that it contains no germs. - You whistle every time you understand something? - Precisely. - So wells are made to bring up the groundwater? - Exactly. - That is great. - I could be, but it is not. - Why not? - The doctor will explain that. - Hello Mr Doctor. - Hello. *Scene missing* - Countryside wells are in poor shape. - Is that so? - Yes. Today one half of the countrymen drink insanitary water. - Please repeat. - Half the countrymen drink insanitary water on a daily basis. - That sounds scary. - It is. - But why is this so? - Most places the wells are in a wretched state. - What is that? - That is Ole Hansen's farm in Kvieb?k. - Why do we go there? - I want to show you a poor well. - That sounds interesting? - It will be. I promise. - Let us lift the well cover. - That is disgusting. - Exactly. Look at the wood-louses. - I hope they do not fall into the well. - They probably will. - There is an earthworm. - It might also fall into the well. But you will see much worse sights. - Let us close the well again. - Yes. Let us look at the cover itself. - It is a little worn. - I would rather say rotten. And it is covered in dirt. - Where do the dirt come from? - You will see. - Oh, the cat is cute. - Look at the mans feet instead. - He put his foot in it. - Yes. Now he goes to the well. - Is she washing diapers? - Yes. - Now she steps in the dirty water. - She is probably heading for the well. - Probably. - Oh, he is in dire straights. - Or a sick person transmitting his germs to the well. - Yes. A heartwarming room. - There is a bucket. It has to be emptied. - Where does he take it? - Probably to the dung heap as usual. Trouble arises if there is a sick person on the farm. Because sooner or later the germs of the sick person will go to the well. - May I see inside the well? - Certainly. - Crikey! - That is just a dead rat. - Yikes. It does look sick as a dog. - You should rather say sick as a rat. - And what is that? - A toad. It will probably fall down to the rat. - They would make a nice couple. - Do you see the slimy walls? - Where do all that moisture come from? - It seeps in from the surroundings. The engineer knows more about this. - The dung heap lies near the well. This is pictures of the real dung heap. - What is on the other side of the well? - That is a sewage pipe. - Is there anything wrong with it? - You will see. - Perhaps the pipes do not seal tightly? - Bravo. You are starting to catch up. - Thank you. - See how filth seeps in from both sides. Do you know why? - Because the walls are not water-tight? - Correct. You get top marks. - But the water from the faucet is clear. - Do not be fooled. Clear water can contain many germs. Many illnesses can spread through water. Typhoid, paratyphoid, Weil's disease, dysentery, even infantile paralysis. - Yikes! - Is she washing strawberries? - Yes. In water from the dung heap. - She is not aware of that. - No. Fortunately for her. She does not know either, that she brushes teeth in sewage water. - No. - It is washing day. - If he just knew about the dead rat. - Yikes! "Cleanliness is a good thing", ... - the woman thinks, while she cools... ...the bathing water with dirty water. Watch this. The germ-filled sponge goes into the mouth. - Yikes! - How do you know, that the water is full of the germs? - That can be seen with a microscope. Do you want to see? - Yes please. That is a funny chap. - That is the rotifer. - I see. - That is the rotifer's wife. - I see, the small one. - In a moment a nasty fellow will turn up. Watch. There he is. It is the sludge worm. - He would be nice to have in your cup? - Indeed. The water contains germs, when these three animals are present. - The danger is imminent. - Countless dangers exist, when germs are present. - Are you not exaggerating? - Absolutely not. - Suppose the water is used to clean milk cans, then... ...typhoid germs will get into the milk. - Then what will happen? - In ten hours a single typhoid germ... ...can multiply into a million. - Blimey! - Yes. Here you see the result. An epidemic breaks out. *Typhoid in Kvieb?k* *The epidemic in Kvieb?k grows* *167 cases last week* *Source of infection in Kvieb?k found* *Typhoid germs in the milk from Ole Hansen's farm* - Something should be done. - Of course. *The milk epidemic in Kvieb?k* *Typhoid germs came from well water* - But what? - It is best to build small waterworks. - Is that not very expensive? - No. A waterworks for 20 farms costs 15000 Kr. - How do you get such a waterworks? - The community can seek help from... ...the country commission. Then a well driller and a suitable spot is found. - What is the tube used for? - The tube is stuck into the ground. Inside the tube a chisel hammers the earth loose. Afterwards a pump is lead into the tube and the loose earth is sucked up. - What happens when the good groundwater is found? - Then a waterworks is built on top of the hole. - What is happening? - The water is aerated and iron is removed. - Here it is filtered and pumped out to the farms. - I see. - It is my turn! Owing to waterworks countrymen now have running water,... ...bathrooms and showers just like city-dwellers. - That is right. - The kitchen has hot and cold water. - Even the cows are serviced. - Then it is not difficult to be a cow? - No. Exactly. - Why do we return here? - I will tell you. Ole Hansen is getting a new well. His farm lies too secluded to receive... ...water from the waterworks. He builds his well properly this time. He uses water-tight concrete collars instead of bricks. - Why is the new well not built in the same place as the old? - So filth from the dung heap and the sewage pipe can not flow into it. - Now it is my turn again! Do you want to know more? - Yes. Why do you show this movie to me? It is for the countrymen. - It is also for city-dwellers. You need to inspect wells when you rent a dacha. Did you not think of that? - Honestly, no. - Do you know why he puts mortar between the collars? - Of course. To seal the furrows so filth can not enter. - Bravo. - The top of the well must be above the ground so surface water can not enter. - He is on a roll. - The cover must be of durable concrete. - Bravo. - The cover must also be sealed to avoid filth coming in. - He is brilliant. - The well must be placed slightly elevated,... ...so surface water flows from the well. - My hat is off to you. - Mine is off too. - Yes, that is water! Real water as we learnt about in school. Consisting of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. - Yes. Not like the water from the old well,... ...which consisted of two parts rotifer and one part sludge worm. The End Reconstructed by KimerFilm for Det Danske Filminstitut
