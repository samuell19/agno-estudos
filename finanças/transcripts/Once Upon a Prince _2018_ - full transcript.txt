[♪♪♪] [man on radio]: Anything? Not yet. Just walking and talking, but no dropping to one knee. What's taking this boy so long? Hold on. Something's happening. Plans change, Susie. We're not the same kids who dreamed about getting married. It took me a long time to admit that, mainly because I don't want to let you down. I feel like I've put my life on hold for you. I was waiting for you. But you didn't have to. You could've started your business without me. Why didn't you? Guess this is goodbye, then. I'm sorry. Oh... This doesn't look good at all. Oh, boy... What's, "Oh, boy..."? Your sister and Adam. Oh. Tell Susie I will of course be her Maid of Honor, but I get to pick the dress color. No peach taffeta like Zoe Snow's wedding. The worst! Avery, honey... that's not going to be a problem. I'm so sorry. [sister]: You can do better! Mom, are you giving Avery a play-by-play of my break up? In my defense, I thought this was going to have a different outcome. Can you just tell Dad I'm going to skip work today? I just need to clear my head. [dad]: It's okay, baby. You take all the time you need. [car radio playing soft rock] [tire popping] [turns radio off] Avery! -Hello. -Hi. Do you need some help? Uh, I do if you have a tire jack. A tire jack? Why, did you get a flat? Yeah, that's why I need the tire jack. Well, shouldn't you have...? You don't have one. Look at that. Yeah, my sister borrowed it. She got a flat a few weeks ago, and she was supposed to return it... But she didn't. Yeah, which I'm just now finding out about. Well, then this must be your lucky day. I don't know about that, but... Come on. Let's see if we can find you a tire jack. Ah-hah! Success! Yes! Do you need something else? Uh... well, I rather thought there'd be instructions. Have you never changed a tire before? First time for everything. What's your name? Oh, sorry. Nate Kenneth, at your service. Hi, Nate Kenneth. I'm Susanna Truitt. Susanna, nice to meet you. Shall we? Yeah. Let's give this a go. Thank you so much. Of course. Do you mind holding this? Not at all. Thank you. With an accent like that, it sounds like you're not from Georgia. [laughing] And here I thought I blended in. Have you heard of a country called Cambria? Um... no, but I'm not that good at geography. It's all right. It's a challenge even for those that are, mainly due to the fact that it's not much larger than your St. Simons Island. Um, may I? Please, thank you. What brings you here? Visiting a family friend. Do you know Mrs. Waller? June Waller? Yeah, her name is on half the buildings in town. She's your friend? Well, my father's, actually. Yeah. I'm on holiday before I start a new job. Oh, what do you do? Public relations. What do you do? Ah, landscape architecture. Oh, impressive. I mean, I'm still trying to get things on my resume. There's not a lot of landscape architect firms on the island, so... Why don't you start your own firm? You're the second person to say that to me in two hours. First one was my boyfriend as he was breaking up with me. I'm sorry, that was... I don't... I don't know why I said that. Well, listen, sometimes, it's easier to tell things to a complete stranger. Yeah, maybe, but I don't really have an answer for either one of you, or myself. Adam and I were supposed to open up our business when he got back, but clearly, that's not going to happen anymore. I've had my plans change unexpectedly, too. It can be quite difficult. Yeah. Oh, here. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Oh, wait, here. Is this a handkerchief? It is. Never met anyone our age with a handkerchief before. Are you sure you're not, like, a time traveler from another era or something? Not that I'm aware of. Okay. Oh... ugh, I'm sorry. That's all right. That's what it's for. Um... I'll clean it. I'll clean it and get it back to you. All right. That tree is incredible. Yeah, it's called Lover's Oak. There's a legend that if a couple gets engaged underneath it, they'll stay married forever. I used to have all these fantasies about getting proposed to underneath there. Nothing fancy, just, you know, the entire thing covered in twinkle lights... a little fancy. Yeah, I guess... had it all planned out, but... things change. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. John Lennon. That's right. You know, I do remember Cambria. You do? Yeah, that's where they recreated the Florentine Gardens, right? Yes, that's right. Right. Breathtaking, aren't they? I couldn't agree more. Well, thank you so much, Nate Kenneth, for everything... and I promise to return your handkerchief cleaned. I look forward to it. Thanks. [engine turning over] Hello, John. Keys. You make my job difficult. It was one drive. Lasting two hours. I went to clear my head, but then I helped a damsel in distress. We sort of worked together, but got my hands dirty. [knocking] Hi. Hi. I never liked Adam. Yes, you did. Retroactively, I didn't. I figured you'd be all red-eyed and puffy, but you seem okay. I mean, trust me, it's not fun. I'm just trying to figure it out. We had all these plans, like... we were going to get married when he finished his tour. We were going to open the business together, and... oof... now I have literally no idea what I'm doing with my life, so... Maybe you could have one? Meaning? Meaning... you've been waiting for this or that... him to return, him to propose, blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, you keep working for Mom and Dad despite having a degree... that just hangs there, like a very expensive wall ornament. Well, Adam and I were going to open the business together. So... now you start it on your own. If anybody can do it, it's my big sister. What is this? Oh, it's... it's... a reminder... that even on a really lousy day, some good can happen. Have you been enjoying your stay so far? Your hospitality, Mrs. Waller, is, as always, impeccable. You remind me so much of your father when he was your age. I can only hope to be half the man he was. I have no doubt that you will be. When do you head home for the festivities? A fortnight. Oof. Well, I hope you're planning to get out and see some of our little island... see the sites, meet some people? You know, I've actually already met one of your locals. Susanna Truitt? Glo and Gib Truitt's eldest? Possibly. She's a landscape architect. I came upon her stranded on the side of the road. And you helped her out, I hope? We sort of worked together. Capable woman. Did you say Susanna's a landscape architect now? I did. In fact, I was hoping to talk to you about that. [Avery]: Thank you. Have a great day. Where's Dad? He's, like, 20 minutes late for his shift. Did you text him? Mm, no answer. Hmm. You know what, can you just take my car and just pop by and make sure everything's okay? Why do I have to be the one to go? Okay, fine. I'll go, and you can just stay and watch the store all by yourself. Thought so. Bye. Here, let me... You again? Me again. What brings you here? Fate. Fate? Indeed. As it happens, Mrs. Waller needs a guiding hand when it comes to her garden, and thanks to our earlier encounter, I just so happen to know a landscape architect. So, Fate. Oh, no, no, no, no... mm-mm. No? No. I can't do Mrs. Waller's gardens. I'm an amateur. You said you were a landscape architect. An amateur landscape architect. I haven't done anything big, and I... [phone buzzing] certainly can't do anything to Mrs. Waller's expectations. Plus, I don't want to go and embarrass you. You wouldn't embarrass me. Come on, at least take the meeting. What if I blow it? What if you don't? [phone buzzing] Excuse me, sorry. This keeps... What is it? It's my father. I need to get to the hospital. Ugh, Avery has my car. I'll drive you. Come. Okay... Excuse me, I'm looking for Gib Truitt's room. Thank you. Dad? -Is everything okay? -I'm fine, honey. There's nothing wrong with me. Stress-induced heart palpitations. I told you I didn't need to come in for this. You did the exact right thing. You, Gib Truitt, you need to rest... at least a week, maybe more. It's spring, Doc. It's our busiest time. Gib... were you under the impression this was optional? Because it's not. He's going to rest. I promise. I'll see you next week. You have to listen to the doctor. Yeah, but the store... We'll figure something out, Dad. You're what's important, Dad. [P.A. announcement]: Dr. Shipp to Emerg. Dr. Shipp to Emerg. You know I'm pleased as punch I'm surrounded by strong women, but there's a little matter of heavy lifting involved. We can manage, and if we can't, we'll hire someone. Mm. I'm not comfortable with just anyone in the store... and we need someone now. Well, perhaps I can be of assistance. You stayed. Thank you. I wanted to make sure your father was all right, and I'm quite serious. I'm happy to help out through the week while he recuperates. You're on vacation. Well, the best part of which is being able to do as I please. [Avery]: And you want to spend a week working in a garden supply store? I would. What is it you do again? Public relations, but I spent quite a bit of time as a boy with my father in the garden, so I know my way around a wheelbarrow. Now, you tell me what you want lifted, carried, whatever else, and I'm your guy. I'll do my best. Nate is staying with Mrs. Waller. And if I were to help out, that might provide you with a bit of a break should you find yourself working on Mrs. Waller's gardens. You're doing Mrs. Waller's gardens? No. Possibly. -I told you... -And I heard, but don't you want to do landscape design? Yes, well, she does. I do. Then you have to start sometime. He's got a point. But... Can you give us a moment? Yes, of course. Do you trust him? I don't really know him. Mrs. Waller trusts him. And he seems super-eager to be helpful. Well, we need helpful right now, and we don't have a lot of options. Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.? Wonderful! Excuse me? Have you seen this man? Am I crazy, or has our Monday shipment been put away already? Yeah. Nate did it. He's been going full steam ahead all morning. Your dad will be relieved. Oh, and as promised... one clean handkerchief. Thank you. You're welcome. Good job today. Thanks! I had a great time. You need to get out more. So I spoke with Mrs. Waller, and she has time tomorrow afternoon to chat... just a chat, and a chance to look at the gardens. No pressure. Okay. -Yes? -Yes. It's an opportunity, and I'm grateful. Nervous, but grateful. Oh, you have, um... dirt. Oh. Right here. [camera clicking] Thank you. Uh... After you, Miss Truitt. Thank you. [John]: So... have you come to your senses? [groaning] I moved pallets of soil, more than I can count. Got scratched up by rose thorns. Every muscle aches, and look, I'm developing a callus. See? Good. Yeah. It was an absurd idea from the outset, and if your mother found out, she would have my head. No doubt. All right, I'm going to take a shower, but there's a 50-50 chance I might pass out on the bed before I do so. Please make sure I'm up by 6:00 a.m. Why? I don't want to be late for my second day. [Gib]: Oh, this is decaf, isn't it? Last thing you need is caffeine. But that's where the fun is. Fun, like a trip to the hospital. Well, don't you look professional? You think? It doesn't look like I'm trying too hard? Oh, not at all. You look lovely. Thanks. So is Nate and Avery at the store? He's meeting me at Mrs. Waller's. Oh, speaking of Nate, I've invited him for supper on Friday. Well, he's been working so hard, and it'll give your dad a chance to get to know him better. Or I could go to the store. No, you're not going to the store. [Susanna]: Okay, I have to go. Wish me luck. -Luck! -Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Um... I'm here to see Nate and Mrs. Waller. You're Susanna Truitt? Yeah. Interesting. [Nate]: Susanna, hello! I see you met John. Old mate from the navy. He doesn't really talk much. Mrs. Waller's just out back here. Did you find the place all right? Yeah, it's beautiful. Here we are. How nice to see you again, Susanna. You as well. Thank you. Susanna was valedictorian at St. Simons High the year I was commencement speaker. I didn't think you'd remember me. Of course, dear. It was my honor to share the stage with you. Tea? Please, yes, thank you. [Mrs. Waller]: So, what do you think? I think it's not a seaside garden, not in the way it should be. What do you mean? Seaside gardens are supposed to be so romantic, and you're supposed to work in harmony with the nature that's around them. In what way? Well, there should be dune grass, and lavender, and sage, and this garden doesn't have any of that. Kind of feels constricted, you know? It feels like there should be some more space. I would start, and I would take out that white fencing right there. Here, I can actually show you. Oh, yes. You see, these drawings, these sketches are a little more natural, and we could use the actual grade of the land as it goes down to the sea, too. These are wonderful. Well, thank you. I obviously did them before I saw your actual garden. But you can do this? Yeah. Well then, don't let me stop you. I have a trip to Europe next week, but you will have any and all access to supplies. So, Susanna has the job? Yes. Didn't I make that clear? Thank you! Thank you. I promise, I will make them perfect and beautiful for you. I have all the faith in the world. Thank you. To fate. To Fate. [laughing] So... that's Ms. Truitt. It explains so much. I don't know what you mean. [John]: You haven't thought this through, Nate. These are my last days of freedom before everything changes. You run the risk of heartbreak... for the both of you. [Susanna]: I like this one down there. This one? Okay. So... yeah. So these two here? Yeah, I think let's do them both. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Yeah, you do the heavy lifting. I like... oh, that guy's really good 'cause it smells so good. This one? Yeah. It's good. Smells very nice. I know. Okay, um... These-- these are pretty, yeah? Yeah. That's all right, I'm just kidding. Just grab it. I am. Are you sure? Careful, they're fragile. You put them down, then. You have to put them down then. Yes. Plant the perennials. Perennials? What do they look like? Um, they're all different things, really. Really? These all different-- All right. Perfect. Can't wait to see what you're going to do here. You're pretty good at this. I didn't go to college for nothing. [Gib]: So you were in the navy? I was. And so, are you retired, or how does that work over there? Ah, well, technically, I'm still part of the service. Once a navy man, always a navy man. Indeed. So, Nate, have you had a chance to see much of St. Simons? Susanna's got him working too much. For which I'm grateful. Well, you have the weirdest idea of a vacation. A respite away from my everyday life.... and this most certainly has been that, but to your point, Mrs. Truitt... -Glo. -Glo. I would very much like to see more of your island before I depart. Susanna could give you a bike tour. You still remember how to do that, don't you, Suse? Susanna used to help give bike tours around St. Simons back when she was competing to be the Peach Princess. I'm sorry, the Peach Princess? Mm-hmm, in high school, Susie won the local Peach Princess Beauty Contest and she became kind of an ambassador for St. Simons for a whole year. She was adorable. I bet she was. [Gib]: Okay, can we get back to talking 'bout the Navy now? Please? Yes, absolutely... um... as soon as I help clear the table? Would that be all right? So should I be calling you the Peach Princess? Is that your official title? I was 16. You have to understand, it was family tradition. I had to enter the contest. Actually, I do understand. Family tradition is very important where I come from as well. Then you get it. I do, and in all sincerity, a bike tour sounds wonderful, if you can spare the time. I think I can swing it. Wonderful. I'll see you at work. Yeah. It's out. [Avery]: Susanna! You are so not going to believe this! Believe what? Who Nate really is! Oh, thank you, Steven. Oh, Nathaniel... Susanna! You're a prince? Oh, you saw. Yeah... I saw. I can explain. Is your explanation, "I'm a prince and it slipped my mind"? Would you believe that? Yeah, actually, I would. You know, 'cause it happens all the time. It does? No! Right... stupid me, um... Would you allow me to explain? I'm sorry for not telling you who I really was. Anonymity is so rare for me, and so I think I held onto it a bit too long. In many ways, being here where no one recognizes me has been such a blessing... especially now. Why now? This will be my last real holiday. My father passed away a few months ago most unexpectedly. I'm so sorry about your father. Thank you. He was a great man, and an unbelievable king. It'll be hard to follow in his footsteps. I think that you can do it. What makes you so certain? Well, I don't know much about what it takes to be a king, but I do know a lot about people, and I've seen how hardworking and generous and kind you are, so... I think the people of Cambria would be very lucky to have you. That might be the best compliment I have ever been given. If I might return the favor... I know your life hasn't gone exactly as you'd thought. That's an understatement. But... you're the sort of smart and resourceful person that'll make the most of any circumstance you find yourself in. Thank you. So, a prince, huh? What's it like to just be watched all the time? You grow accustomed to it. No, for me, the hardest part is having decisions made for me, sometimes even before I was born. Like what? Where I'll go to university... Naval Academy. My area of study... political science, civil engineering, law. Whom I'll marry. You have arranged marriages? No, but... when I do marry, I must marry a woman from Cambria. Must? It's tradition. Anyone in mind? Names are always being floated... one more than others. [reporters]: Lady Ginny! Lady Ginny, this way! Did he tell you anything about this relationship? How many women has it been now? What are you up to now, Morris? Lady Ginny! Lady Ginny! [Susanna]: He's a prince, Dad! He's, like, the real thing. And he's been hauling mulch for us! Okay, Nate is coming. I told him we were going to play it cool. Hi, honey... I mean, uh... It's all right. Hon' is fine. I wanted to apologize to you for not being forthright about my identity. You've all been so giving, and I really appreciate being treated just like a normal... No need to apologize, hon'. You are too kind, Now, I wish that I could continue working here because it's been truly fun... [clearing throat] But now that my secret is out, that is quite impossible. Well... Nate, you've already done so much. And we can get someone else to cover when my dad's recovering. I know this is a little late at this point, but... Gib and I got this made up for you. Thank you... all of you. I'm going to miss this place. We're going to miss you. Oh, we never got that bike tour. Well, are you leaving town right away? Day after tomorrow. So, what are you doing right now? Let's do it. Here we are. Yeah. Isn't that the tree where we first met? Yeah, exactly. Oh, well, come on. Let's stop here. So beautiful. [Nate]: Now, the day we met, that was a great day, but... in all my life, I've never had a day like today. I feel... free. Is that a good thing? The best. Thank you. Could you be something else... other than a prince? I'll be king soon. I know that. I just mean... When I first met you, you seemed so eager to help. You even volunteered at the store. Why? The real reason. The chance to lead a normal life... just for a few days. The chance to make my own decisions. Royalty has evolved into a mostly ceremonial position. Ceremonies are theatre. For some time now, I've felt as if I was a prop in someone else's life. Will that change when you become king? I certainly hope so. I'm sure it will. So what's the first thing you're going to do as king? Open the Florentine Gardens to the public. They're so beautiful, they should be shared... I mean, especially once Sir Edward's finished renovating the South Oval. Sir Edward? Tilbury. He's... Yeah, he's amazing! I studied his work in college. I thought he'd retired. He had, but my mother is very good at getting her way. Wow. [laughing] I wish you could see the gardens. You'd love them. Maybe someday. I certainly hope so. We should probably get going. Yeah, right. I can't figure this out. It's all right. I got it. [camera clicking] You coming? Eventually. [phone ringing] Lady Ginny? What a surprise. Someone's been busy. And making a profit. So I've seen. So everyone has seen. Here's the thing, Morris. Remember how I pulled in a few favors with the Queen to get you into the royal press pool? Yeah... Then you also know how very much you owe me, Now, Morris... are there any other surprises you'd like to tell me about? [John]: According to your mother, Lady Ginny was just able to stop Morris Alderman from publishing this. I'm sorry, Nate, but the Queen was quite clear. The flight leaves in three hours, and your bags are already packed. We must leave now. [line ringing] [rings] [dryer blowing] [voice mail]: Hey, it's Susanna. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you ASAP. Hey, Susanna, it's Nate. Bit of bad news. I have to return home immediately. I'm so sorry I couldn't say goodbye in person. Evie Jones is at the register. She wants to talk to you. Oh. Hi, Evie. What's up? Are the rumors true? Yes, we had a prince working for us. No, he is no longer here. Oh, not about him. That you're redoing Mrs. Waller's gardens? Uh, yeah... yeah, that's true, actually. Congratulations. Thank you. Are you available to do some work on my gardens when you're done? I'd love to. Wonderful. Thank you. Of course! Thank you. Thank you. There will be a few hours between the coronation and the coronation ball. Is there anything in particular you'd like to include in the itinerary after the morning's walkthrough? Is my son dreaming about America... or one American in particular? Thank you, John. Hello, Mother. Hello, darling. Good flight? Good enough. What's this? This is your grandmother's engagement ring. It's time you started to think about your life after the coronation. This is quite a way off. Not as far as you might think, and Lady Ginny has proven herself quite useful of late. Not that again, Mother. You must choose someone. It cannot be the American. Remind me again why. [laughing] You know why. Tradition... and to be fair, the girl has absolutely no preparation for a role such as this. Few do. And is this where you remind me that Ginny does? No need. Most of all, Nathaniel, you must always remember that you are to be the King of Cambria. There are enough doubts about the role of the monarchy in the modern era as is. We would be beyond foolish to invite more trouble, and we are not foolish. Now, I have a very boring meeting with the Prime Minister, but you'll be pleased to know... I have invited Lady Ginny for tea. Hello, darling. Ginny... what a surprise. I wasn't certain you'd make it back in time for your big day. I was only gone a couple of weeks. A lot can happen in a few weeks, and apparently did. Ginny, you're always best when you're direct, so please... let me have it. I merely wanted to see how you were doing after your trip to America. Rumors are swirling that our future king is perhaps distracted. Anything in particular, or... anyone? Well... I do have this rather large event on the horizon. The coronation ball. You do remember how to dance, don't you? I do, but... there's also the actual coronation. Oh, that. You'll get through that with ease, but should you need help, you know perfectly well there's no one else who understands you quite like I do, and who also knows how to navigate the nuances of royal politics. I'm quite unique. That you are. Tea? Please. Aw.... looks real nice, honey. Thank you. I just want it to all be done when Mrs. Waller gets back. It's going to be perfect. Is everything okay? Something on your mind? Dr. Miller gave your father the go-ahead to return to the store full-time. That's great. Well, not if he goes back to working the same crazy amount. I mean, having Nate help us like he did just made it more obvious... we need to hire a couple more people... especially now that your landscaping's taking off. Mom, it's just Mrs. Waller and Evie Jones. That's it. It's a start. Folks like that you're Mrs. Waller's choice, and it's just going to grow from there. I hope so. I know so. You're made for bigger things, Susie. I've always felt that. Thank you. I love you. [John]: Some bills from the Prime Minister for you to sign, ma'am. I'll e-mail your secretary the security updates. [Queen]: Nathaniel hasn't been the same since he's returned. I recognize that look, and so do the gossip pages. Nathaniel is to be crowned King of Cambria within ten days. As such, he is required to marry a woman of Cambrian descent. I want him to be happy, not hurt... not harboring some delusion of a young girl who could never fit in. Perhaps he should see that. What do you mean? At the moment, Ms. Truitt is an ideal, the personification of all that he cannot have. That's due in part to the romanticized circumstance in which they were together. And your suggestion is? Change the circumstance. Bring her to Cambria. Allow him to see her in a new role. Shatter the illusion? That could work. I think we might have to take it one step further... show him without question that she could never be Queen of Cambria. I think I have an idea of how to do it... and you're going to help me, John. Of course, ma'am. Anything you need. An apprentice? To Sir Edward Tilbury. Who's that? He's the most famous landscape architect in the entire world. And he wants you to apprentice for him? [Susanna]: I feel like Nate probably pulled some strings because I know he's working in the Florentine Gardens in Cambria. Well, it says here that it's only until Nate's coronation. That's next week. I bet you get an invitation to go. I want to go! Okay, calm down. I don't even know if I'm going to go What are you talking about? Of course you're going to go. Well, what about the store? I mean, who's going to cover? Well, I'm back, and Uncle Lonnie said he would help. And I'll go with Susanna, so she's not all alone... in a foreign country... [squealing] where we know royalty! It's gorgeous. -We're here. -I'm so excited! I can't wait to see our castle rooms. It's so pretty. Thank you. This is not how I pictured it. Well, this is the employee quarters. You think you could call Nate to get us an upgrade? I'm sure Nate knows we're here. He's just... he's busy. He'll call us when he can. Besides, I have to get to work. Fine. You go do that... while I go shopping! Um, Sir Edward? Hi, I'm Susanna Truitt. Ah, the American. Yes. Um... yes, I am American... but I just wanted to say, I am so honored to be working with you. This is just a dream come... Yes, well, take this. Down the path, round the corner, and clean that area. Okay, um... I just... Well, get on with it. Shoo! Oh! Hi. What are you doing? Uh... Oh, um... Your Highness. Majesty. Your Majesty. Ma'am, may I present to you... Yes, I know who this is. You're exactly as I imagined. I was thinking gooseberries in that area. Splendid idea, ma'am. Yes, I shall instruct the gardeners to... I don't understand why this wasn't on my schedule. It was a last-minute addition. Your mother wanted to promote the renovations as well as your coronation. My coronation hardly needs promotion. The clothes here are awesome. We can easily find stuff to wear for the coronation. We weren't invited to the coronation. We will be. Nate's not going to ignore us while we're here. I'm here to work. Fine... but Susie? They have ball gowns that are gorgeous! We weren't invited to the coronation ball, either. We will be. How can you be so sure? Because it's Nate. Speaking of our former hired help, have you seen him yet? Because I have questions about this whole dorm situation. Remember, we're guests here, okay, so when we're in public, we have to refer to him as Prince Nath-- [Nate]: Obviously, it's an earlier time than I was expecting. Hold on one second. Nate? Hey, I was wondering when I'd run into you! Susanna? Hey! [cameras clicking] -Nathaniel. -Turn this way, darling. John, handle this. Come, come... I'm so sorry... Okay... thank you, that's all for today. Well, that was embarrassing. John will make sure none of those photos are published. Thank goodness. What are you doing in Cambria? I'm here for the apprenticeship with Sir Edward. The what? The landscape architecture apprenticeship. I thought you put me up for it? I don't even know what it is. Well then, you don't know that Avery's here either? -She is? -Yeah. Well, that's great. When did you both arrive? Two days ago. She's been out sightseeing and shopping while I do all the work, and I'm working in the new garden. That's why I look like... You look lovely. Liar. I bet you're the prettiest gardener in the crew. Wow... This is beautiful. Wait, if you didn't bring me here, who did, and why? I may have an idea. The Queen, yes. I met her this morning. You met my mother? Mm-hmm. She's got intimidation down to an art form, huh? Yes, she does. A skill honed from childhood. My father always used to say that he was king, but she ruled. You know what? I actually kind of admire that. Wait, where are you staying? Uh, the employee quarters. Oh, no. That will not do. Follow me, please. [Nate]: Welcome to the guest wing, where you should have been all along. Amazing. Now, Avery, you're in here, and Susanna, you're just next door. Told you Nate would take care of us. Bit of an improvement, hmm? Little bit, Nate. We can still call you Nate, right? Of course. Well, in private, but in public, we should... stick to the rules. [cell phone buzzing] Duty calls. Um... can you join me for lunch tomorrow? Uh, yeah, I'd love to. I just, I don't really know if we get a lunch break or when. I certainly hope you do. Let's lunch together... although... to avoid any more impromptu photo ops, shall we say the pagoda, noon? Okay, perfect. Yeah, I'd love to. Great. [squealing] Good morning, Nathaniel. Good morning, Mother. Don't you seem chipper this morning? I am. I ran into a couple of friends yesterday. Oh? Susanna and Avery Truitt. Ah. It seems you've already met Susanna. Yes, when I was examining the progress in the garden. What are you up to? I don't know what you mean. You know exactly what I mean. Well, isn't she a friend of yours? Isn't this an opportunity for her? Think of the stories she'll be able to tell her clients when she gets back to America. It'll be a feather in her cap. It sounds so... benevolent. Thank you very much. If it was anything but benevolent, would I have allowed her sister to come along? Mm. I'm not sure, but you did place them both in the employee quarters. Susanna is an employee. I'm sure that's the reason. Regardless, I've now moved them both to the guest wing. Without consulting me? I don't need to consult you, Mother... and... be prepared. I'm inviting them both to the coronation. The family coronation? Yes. You can't. Why not? She's American. They both are. And so is Mrs. Waller. I have invited a few very select friends and family to your coronation. Exactly. My coronation. Nathaniel... I worry that you'll get swept up, and do something foolish... like leave. I love my country, Mother. This is my home. I'm not going anywhere. Promise me you will not abdicate. I would never. Good... because your cousin Colin is next in line, and we both know he'd have the throne room turned into a disco by week's end. [chuckling] [chuckling] [Nate laughing] -It's true! -No, you're exaggerating. Yeah, it's true. Oh, God. Ah... [phone buzzing] Oh, sorry. Does the famous Lady Ginny know that you're having lunch with me? No, why should she? I read somewhere that you guys were practically engaged. Mm... read where? It was online gossip websites. Ah, yes. They love to speculate about us. So, is it true? Ginny and I have been friends since we were children. And you dated? Briefly, in university. Why'd you guys break up? Because neither of us was ready to settle down. But someday, you might be? Ready to settle down? I certainly hope so. No, I mean, Lady Ginny checks all the boxes. Mm. Now I know you've been reading those gossip sites. What? She's a Cambrian aristocrat. Isn't that essentially a prerequisite? More of a tradition. Isn't it the same thing? To my mother, yes. Oh, I am going to be late for work. I'll help you clean up. No, don't bother. I've got this. I've kept you too long anyway. I don't want you to be late for Sir Edward. Okay. I'll see you later. Bye. [Queen]: It isn't working. What isn't? Bringing the American here. First, I hear that Nathaniel has moved the Truitts into the guest suites, and now I hear they're sneaking off together to have lunches in the garden. Lunches? Sounds harmless. It isn't harmless, it's dangerous. Your plan has failed. Perhaps it's because Nathaniel has already seen Susanna in a garden environment, and it's one in which she excels. Even Sir Edward said he was impressed with how hard she works. He said that? Sir Edward is rarely impressed, which doesn't help the problem. Ah, wonderful. You're both here. I just wanted to let you know that I've invited both Susanna and Avery to the Coronation Ball. John, please make note of that so there are no curious security issues. Thanks. It's getting exciting. Nate, I can't go to a ball. Why not? Because I'd feel out of place. I've never been to a royal ball before. It's probably going to be deadly dull. You're not selling it. Unless you were there. Nate... Do you know how to dance? Uh, does line dancing count? I don't know what that is, but I'm suddenly desperate to see it. No. Fine. Hmm. What's in here? Wow. This is amazing. Wow. Not showing you my line dancing here. A waltz. It's easy. -No. -Yes. -We can't. -We are. Here? What could be better? It's easy. You'll pick it right up. [playing music] So... follow these steps. Madam. Right foot back. Left off to the side. Very good. I'm already confused. You got this. Now, left food forward. Right to the side, and left to right. Very good. Again. One... two... three. One... two... three. Did they teach you this in prince school? They do. It's on the test. [laughing] All right, very good. Now we partner. Okay. Same as before. I'll lead. And... one, two, three... one, two, three... Yes... [chuckling] You're great. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Oh, don't be silly. I only just got here myself. Did you start without me? Uh, well, no. I might have had just one sandwich. Okay. What's that? Ah, my oath. What's that for? My coronation oath. See, the Archbishop reads this here and here, and I respond. Kind of like wedding vows. A bit, yes. Have you practiced? Only just, but I'm supposed to. Let's practice. All right. [clearing throat] Ready? Yes. "Are you, Nathaniel Kenneth Richard Leopold Bartholomew..." Seriously? Yes. My father's was longer. Wow. "Are you willing and able to take the oath to be the King of Cambria?" I am willing and able to take this oath and swear by all that I have that I will be a good and faithful servant. "And do you promise to uphold and defend the laws, charters, and constitution of the Kingdom of Cambria?" I do so promise. "And do you promise to protect the freedoms and rights of all Cambrian citizens?" I do... with all my heart, from this day forward and all the days of my life... so help me God. "I now pronounce you King and country." [clapping] Nicely done, Nathaniel. I think you and Cambria will make a lovely couple. Ginny! What brings you here? The Queen sent me. Now, don't be rude. Introduce me to your friend. Of course. Ginny, this is Susanna Truitt. Susanna, this is Lady Genevieve Byron. Do I curtsy? Please don't. I'm too young to feel like my parents. [laughing] Why did my mother send you? Apparently, Her Majesty was trying to get ahold of you about some coronation logistics... something or another, and to talk to the Archbishop, but you don't seem to be answering your phone. Um... Well, I'll just... I'll clean up. I'll help. Okay. Thank you both. Your oath? Right. Can't forget that. It's lovely to meet you at last, Susanna. At last? Well, you've certainly been the talk of the town since the photos surfaced. I don't think you know what you'd be getting yourself into. I'm sorry? With Nathaniel. Oh, we're just friends. Yes, but as one who has genuinely been his friend for many years, I think it should be pointed out that standing beside royalty is much more than watching polo matches and wearing the proper hat. There are expectations. Why are you telling me this? Because I care deeply about the Cambrian monarchy, and if it is to survive the 21st century, then Nathaniel needs someone beside him who understands how to control what people see... and what they do not. You. It's nothing personal, Susanna. This is merely the way things are. Tradition. That's right. Tradition. I'll take this back to the house. Bring the glasses, will you? Look who I found! Mrs. Waller! I came for the coronation and much to my delight found I wasn't the only St. Simons resident here. I've been catching her up on everything you've been doing. And not doing. Your sister tells me you haven't gotten your gowns for the ball yet. Well, we're not sure if we're going. We're going. [Mrs. Waller]: You've been invited, haven't you? Yeah. By the prince himself. Well then... as ladies of St. Simons, Georgia, it's our duty to make sure we properly represent. We are going shopping. My treat. What do you think? Yes, let's go! It's so beautiful here. The first time I came to Cambria as a little girl, I thought this is the place that all the fairy tales were talking about. That's exactly what it feels like. And you have the best view of anyone, working in the gardens. You have seen the Florentine Gardens? I've been working so much, I haven't really had a chance. You have to change that. What are you doing here? Mrs. Waller told me about these gardens, so I was just... This is a private garden. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. It's really beautiful. Yes, it is. It's Italian, isn't it? That's right. The design is exquisite. Did Sir Edward do it? No, my... late husband, Leo... designed this garden for me. For you? Yes. It was a wedding present. He redesigned the castle gardens to match the garden where he proposed to me, in Florence... a proposal that I was free to accept because I was from a Cambrian family. The tradition in Cambria. An important one... one that should be respected. Well, thank you for letting me share in your garden. It's beautiful. [church bells ringing] I only wish your father were here to see this. He would be so proud. Thank you. Good luck. Are you, Nathaniel Kenneth Richard Leopold Bartholomew, willing and able to take the oath to be the King of Cambria? I am willing and able, and swear by all that I have that I will be a good and faithful servant. And do you promise to protect the freedoms and rights of all Cambrian citizens and residents? I do, with all my heart, from this day forward and all the days of my life, so help me God. God save the King! God save the King. Could be your turn next, Ginny. I'm not sure what you mean, Your Majesty. The king needs a queen. I can't think of anyone more suited to the position than you. Why are you packing? I'm not going. What? But... we have dresses! I'll return mine to Mrs. Waller. What is going on? I just... what am I thinking? This whole thing with Nate, it's never going to... work. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. You've never once looked at anyone the way you look at Nate. Not even close. That makes it worse. Because...? Because he's not "Nate". He's not the guy who helped me lug soil and helped me in Mrs. Waller's garden and who I rode bikes with around St. Simons. He's Nathaniel, King of Cambria now. And you're my big sister who worked all through high school and still got straight As, then worked two jobs in college and got on I don't even know how many honor rolls every single year. Okay, you're strong and smart and caring, and if King Nathaniel suddenly forgets all of that just because he recited some vows or whatever, then he's not the Nate that we know. How many times in your life do you think we'll get an invitation to a royal ball? Come on, Susie! We have to go. [♪♪♪] If you're looking for Lady Ginny, she's right over there. The renovations to the gardens are being well received. Mm. Do you think your father would have approved? He would love them. In fact... they're so beautiful, I want to share them with the public. Really? Really. We've kept them to ourselves for too long. It's time we open them up. It's time we open up. Oh, I see. Man of the People. Yes. Change will do us good. You're the king. Apparently. You know... I believe this is the first time we've danced together since we dated. A long time ago. Some things remain the same. Everyone is staring. Everyone always stares. You're not. Your eyes are everywhere else but on me. I'm sure she'll show up soon. Who? You know who. [music ending] [clapping] Susanna. I heard some music. Thought I would check it out, see what was going on. Just this little party I'm throwing. Any special occasion? None that I can think of at this very moment. Will you dance with me? Look into my eyes. Remember our practice. Just pretend it's you and I in here. All right? [waltz playing] Good evening, Mrs. Waller. John. I've been meaning to thank you for your recommendations on dress shops in town. They were quite fruitful, as you can see. Just doing my job. Which is? To protect Nathaniel. You look beautiful. Oh... Mrs. Waller helped me pick out this dress. It's not the dress. It's you. But I must admit, I was a bit nervous there that you weren't coming. Well, I almost didn't. Why? Because you're a king, Nate. Nathaniel. Nate. To you, I will always be Nate. But to the rest of the world, you're King Nathaniel Kenneth Richard... ...Leopold Bartholomew. It's exhausting. It's always been exhausting... but with you by my side, I finally feel like I can tackle this new chapter of my life and remain sane... thrive, even. You don't need me to thrive. You were born to be king. You're going to be amazing at this. Oh, wow. What? It just hit me. It just truly hit me... I'm a king. We should have a toast to celebrate, like you did for me when I was hired for Mrs. Waller's gardens. Excellent idea... although I'm not sure we have any sweet tea here in Cambria. Some champagne, then? It's a sacrifice, but... You really are beautiful. I'll be right back. Two glasses of champagne? Is one of those for me? Um... No, I understand. I didn't until I saw the two of you together, dancing and laughing, and you looking at her how I'd always hoped you'd look at me... but you never did, and you never will. Ginny... would you be cross with me if I said I think you two might get along? Yes, right now, I will... but... I think you're right. Someday. Someday. Ah, Susanna, there you are. I was looking for you. I have a little confession. I was the one who arranged your apprenticeship. Why? I wanted to show my son how wrong you are, both for him, and for Cambria. Well, respectfully, Your Majesty, I've never claimed to be right for him. Love is wonderful, but it fades, and in its place remains responsibility and duty, neither of which is easy, and that is why our family has always married people from Cambria. They know what to expect, both the good and the bad. Like Lady Ginny. Nathaniel may not be in love with her, but he respects her and likes her and knows that she is ready to take over the position and the commitments. And I'm not? How could you be? You're not from here. I like you, Susanna... but I simply must put my country, and my son's future, first... no matter what. Good night, Susanna. [eager chatting] [Evie]: Oh, thank you! Look forward to seeing you next week. You too. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Evie Jones seems happy. I know. I'm going to start on her place next week. Oh, honey, I'm so proud! And I have two other leads that came in. Oh, that's wonderful! I guess word spread really fast about me working on Mrs. Waller's house. Maybe you should tell Nate. Have you spoken to him? No, and I don't expect to, but it's okay. I think even though things may have not worked out the way that I'd hoped, I believe things are going to work out the way that they're supposed to. His Majesty's lunch with the Prime Minister went very well. I feel confident they'll have an excellent working relationship. Excellent. Thank you, John. If there are no further questions... It's been a week since the coronation. Do you think he's begun to get over her? No. Nor do I. In fact, if anything, I think it's rather worse than before she arrived. John... one of the many qualities that I have always admired about you is your uncanny ability to accurately assess a person or a situation and to give sound, sage advice. Thank you, ma'am. So, I find it rather confusing that when it came to making suggestions as to what to do about Nathaniel's feelings for Susanna, you came up with a plan that was so spectacularly wrong. Did I? Didn't you? Ma'am, my job always has been and always will be to protect this family. Protection comes in many forms. I feel very confident that my suggestion to bring Ms. Truitt to Cambria was entirely about doing what is best for this family, and the King. Ma'am. What are you doing? Gardening. I remember when Father and I used to come here when I was a boy... get our hands dirty. It's important, you know? Stay connected to the earth... not feel above anyone or anything. I remember when the two of you used to come back from the garden covered in dirt and happy as could be. I think Father would have liked her. They could've talked about the garden together. Probably. I just don't understand why she left. You know, why didn't she say goodbye? Perhaps she thought she was doing the right thing for you. The right thing? She seems like a sensible girl. I'm sure her heart is in the right place. And what place is that? A realistic place. She understands that marriage to you is impossible. Because of tradition. Yes. So, because no member of the royal family has ever married someone not born in Cambria, I'm not free to do so now? -Nathaniel, listen... -No, Mother. When I took the oath to be king, I swore that I would protect the rights and freedoms of all Cambrian citizens. Of course. I am a Cambrian citizen. I have rights, and I have freedoms. But... you are an example. And what sort of example would I be were I to abandon the woman that I love? I've never heard you say those words before... that you love someone. Because I've never said them before. Words have impact and meaning, and I do not use them lightly. Just like your father. Yes. He said to me he only ever told one woman ever that he loved her... and that, when my time came, I better mean it. I do, Mother. -[Avery]: Hey. -Hey! What are you doing for the rest of the night? I'm just going to go home and work on this design for Evie Jones' garden. Can you give me a ride home? What happened to your car? I got another flat. -Avery! -I know. I know. Come on. Let's get out of here. I'll drive. Okay. [Susanna]: Why are we stopping? What's this? Go on. Hello. Nate? What's all this? Susanna, I don't know if you have any interest in becoming part of the royal family. It can be a bit of a challenge, I assure you, but if you do... and if you love me even a fraction as much as I love you... then I know we can rewrite tradition. Susanna... I offer to you my future, my heart, and my kingdom. Will you marry me and be my queen? Uh... Susanna, give the boy an answer! Are you guys crashing my engagement? Focus, Susanna. I thought you wanted... More than anything, I want what any mother wants... for her child to be happy, and you make him happy. Yes. Nathaniel Kenneth Richard Leopold Bartholomew, I will absolutely be your queen. And one more thing, my Peach Princess. We need somebody to renovate the North Oval of the gardens. Any suggestions? One.
