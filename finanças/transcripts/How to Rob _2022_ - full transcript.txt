[muffled thud] [Richard] You'll never see him again. Not as you know him. Not in this life. [ethereal music] [footsteps approaching] [panting] [Jimmy] Hey! Hey. What you running from? These two kids. Wanna beat my ass. -What'd you do to them? -Nothing. They just started chasing me. Huh. I'll fight for you. If you want to fight, I'll fight with you. [boy 1] Get back here! [suspenseful music] [thud] Come on, man, hit these fuckers. [ominous music] [knocking at door] [Sean] Police! Open up! One more knock and then can I kick it down? -[knocking at door] -Police! Open up! What this about? [Jimmy] Oh, sorry to bother you, ma'am. Uh, mind if we come inside and have a word? [sighs] Come on in. [hip-hop music playing on speakers] Afternoon, ma'am. We're looking for your son. Is he home? [woman] He's downstairs in his room pretending to be a gangster. [Jimmy scoffs] Well, do you mind if we talk to him? Have at it. Thank you very much. Uh, you boys, you want some coffee? You know, I'd love a to-go cup. [Sean] We're all set, ma'am. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much.

You've all got talent, I can see. Now, we're gonna sort all that out. [rap music continues] -Can I see a warrant? -They aren't real cops, you fucking idiot. Look at their badges. They're not even fucking real. [Jimmy chuckles] Yeah, you're right. [exhales] We're not cops. So the smart thing to do would be... Get your fucking knees on the ground.

[woman 1 scoffs] He just got out of Shirley. And when he finds you two, he's gonna fucking kill you! [Jimmy] Wh-- Shirley? You're joking. I'm gonna fuck your father in the street when he finds us.

[laughs] Well, if he says anything about us having an unwholesome, consensual sex in the street, let him know that Sean didn't know his role when he made those statements. Oh, but that sounds like Sean. [all laughing] -Holy shit! -[waitress] Sean. -[Sean] Hey. -I was getting pinched or something. Sneaking up on a guy like that. Hmm. Why don't you go in to the bathroom and reach into the envelope you just got, -and find me the 1500 for your tab. -Oh! [chuckles] First of all, you are severely overestimating how much your husband pays for hard labor. And second, there's no way in fuck my tab is $1500. You think I just pulled that number out my ass? -$1524. -[scoffs] But I rounded down for you. [laughs] Frankie, you don't, you don't charge family. And you're like my family. Judge is like my dad. And you're like my hot stepmom who eventually gets bored of my dad -and has an affair with me. -[sighs] [both laugh] -[Frankie] You watch too much porn, Jimmy. -[scoffs] -That's accurate. -[Sean chuckles] Honey, I will dock his next paycheck, okay? Right. Frankie, you forgot my beer. She didn't forget. [all laughing] So, uh... ...what's next on the docket? It's got juice. [clears throat] That's what we like to hear. It's a big deal. This is bigger than anything I've given you two. It's on the Cape. Fucking right wing nut. He's got a goddamn arsenal in his house He's preparing for the zombie apocalypse or something. This is the type of guy who takes his pistol into the shower. But he drinks. And he likes his reefer. Every Thursday night he goes to trivia at the bar down the street. He doesn't play. He just drinks and listens. [ominous music] You wait for him by his driveway. You catch him stepping out of his car. You pull the pistol from his hip and his ankle, and you're in. -Simple enough. -Mm-hmm. This guy sounds like he's been waiting his entire life for an excuse to pull the trigger. -So? -[chuckling] I'm not trying to get killed. How much are we talking? He's got pistols, rifles, grenades, machine guns. You two are walking out with 30k. Easy. [chuckles] We're in. All right.

What? Have you noticed all these bike lanes they're putting around Quincy? I mean, when was the last time you saw anybody ride a bike around here? I swear to fucking God, man. It's all these yuppies moving in with their smoothie shops, and their avocado toast, and their art galleries on every corner with a line around the block waiting to get in and see some asshole with some fucking bag around his head. [scoffs] -[laughs] -That's what you were thinking about? -Yeah! Yeah. -[chuckles] On the dance floor? I swear to Christ, man. This place is turning into the People's Republic of Cambridge. [laughs] Listen. I was doing some thinking of my own. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. I'm gonna do this job. -Yeah! [laughs] -Hey, but, but... Under one condition. Oh. The money we're making off of it, we're putting it towards the company. -The company? [scoffs] -Yes. We have everything we need. What could we possibly need 30k for? -We need a dump truck, man. -Oh! [laughs] Oh, my God, the fucking dump truck again. It's a game changer. We get one of those, we can mow more lawns before we have to dump. -[laughs] -It's the next step. I'm getting seriously fucking fatigued hearing about this dump truck. We can't be ripping off drug dealers and card games for the rest of our lives. We need something real. There are people out there making millions off of landscaping. -Sounds unreal. -Mm-hmm. [clicks tongue] Look, you're right. I know this can't last forever. Th-- this guy I was locked up with in South Bay, we reconnected. He's getting heroin from Mexico at a hell of a price. We take this 30k and invest that and we're making millions without pushing the mower. If you wanna talk millions. You know what, man? We're crooks. I know that. I know that. I'm not asking you to shed it. But there are crooks, and there are corporate crooks. One of them gets Fed time or a bullet to the head. The other one gets a tennis court prison, if he gets anything at all. You know, enough lectures for one night. Let's get another round. -Frankie! -No, no, no, no. I, I gotta go. Dude, come on. We're fucking celebrating here. I was supposed to be at Tina's an hour ago. Oh, Tina. I know, I know. You're having sex with her and I'm sure that's fun.

Everybody. Frankie, Frankie! [laughs] -I'll see you at home. -No. -Wanna get my beer? -Sure. -This one, he paid for this one. -[Frankie] Mm-hmm. [sighs softly] Can I help you? You could. I'm cooking now. You're boiling water. That's hardly cooking. Well, what do I get out of it? My love and loyalty. -[both chuckle] -No. -It's not gonna cut it. -Okay. I'll cook the rest of the meal.

See, when you, when you put it that way, it makes me sound, um... Uh, selfish? -Yeah, a little bit. -Yeah. 'Cau-- 'cause it is. -Oh. -It is. Uh-oh. No. If you want this to happen you're gonna have to go down there first. And then maybe after I finish, if I'm feeling extra nice... ...I'll put on those boots that you love, so you can hold them in the air while you fuck me. What's the matter? Nothing. -[quietly] Okay. -I gotta talk to you about something. Okay. My uncle in Chicago, he had a heart attack. -A bad one. -Shit. I'm sorry. Don't be. He lived and he's an asshole. Um, but it's my aunt who I'm worried about. Um, he's gonna be out of commission for a while, and she's got the business and she's already overwhelmed. Okay. She asked me to come to Chicago. Run the books for her. And you wanna do that? All I've ever known is Quincy, Sean. I don't wanna live and die here. I've been thinking about it for a while. So you're gonna do it. I told them I'd only go if there's a place for you too. We've been talking about moving in together for a year now, Sean. This is our chance to do that. I got my own business here. Yeah. And you essentially run it by yourself. Jimmy's drunk or absent almost every day that you're out there. [calm piano music] This is an opportunity for us, Sean. To get out of here. See something new. I can't leave him hanging like that. You're not leaving him hanging. It's called being an adult. It's making decisions. It's living your own life. He's like my brother, Tina. And I'm all he has. [sighs deeply, mutters] Fuck. Yeah. And if he loved you like you love him, he'd want what's best for you. You know where I stand. I want you with me. But I can't make this decision for you. And I can't ask you to leave your home. Or Jimmy. Even if I know that's the right thing for you to do. [chair scraping] [pop song playing on radio] [music stops] [Jimmy] Corky! What's up, Jimmy. Don't fucking "What's up, Jimmy" me. What did I say about these fucking drugs. You told me, "Don't do drugs." I'll make a lot more money selling them if I'm not a goddamn fiend myself. That's right. Until you come along. Right, Jim? [Jimmy laughs] Don't be a wise ass, kid. I know it's just fucking, just weed, but, uh, -it's a fucking gateway. -Yeah, yeah. All right, Jimmy. All right. [mockingly] "Yeah, yeah. All right, Jimmy. All right." You want to have a drink? Come on. Have a drink. [Jimmy] Fuck. You're 21, right? -[Corky] Eighteen. -Eighteen? If that's old enough to stand trial, enough to have a drink. Have a seat over there I'm gonna grab us a drink. [objects clatter] Hey, come out of the bedroom. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Put both hands where I can see them. Both hands. Get the fuck outta here. Who the fuck are you? I'm, I'm nobody, man. [trembling] Sorry. I'll just, just go. [gasps, choking] -Who said you could leave? -[panting] How did you get in here? [stuttering] The fire escape. The door wasn't shut. Where are you from? From here. You steal from your own people? I'm fucking sick, man. I get these withdrawals. I feel like I'm fucking dying when I get them. [panting] Is that my fucking pillow case? -Uh, uh... [choking] -Answer hum, huh? Yeah. You know what? Corky, let him go. -Empty your fucking pockets. -Okay. No, fuck that. You know what? Take your fucking clothes off. What, what fuck-- Come on, man! It's cold outside. You know what's worse than being cold? Being cold with no fucking teeth in your head. Now take your fucking clothes off. Now! [whimpering] There we go. Nice ink. [Corky] The guy fucking stinks, Jim. [Jimmy laughs] [sighs] I've had fun tonight. You're free to go. -And don't come back! -[whimpers] [Jimmy] And close the door after you. [both laugh] That was fucking outstanding, my boy. Oh, hey, for future reference, never stand behind someone I'm pointing the gun at, okay? Other than that, A-fucking-plus on the effort, kid. Hey, you know what? Take some cash. You earned it. Don't gotta pay me, Jim. You know I'll ride with you for free. All right. I didn't know you were like that, kid. Shit. Corky, I deal with problems like that every day. And I've come to learn that there's always a way to solve a problem. Comes down to two things. How much you know. And how far you're willing to go. [chuckles] Oop! [laughs] -[glasses clinking] -[inaudible] kid. Thanks, Jim. -[coughs] -Oh, yeah! [chuckles] [laughs] -That's some strong shit. -Oh, yeah. [rap music] [muffled rap music] [grunts] [Jimmy] I got two ram rods. Double rainbow kit. [Jimmy] Oh, screw it. [scraping paper] [Jimmy] Thinking of getting Corky involved in some jobs. I think he's right for it. No. Oh, come on, man. There's no replacing you. No, man. I don't want him involved. Why not? -[bottles clanking] -[Jimmy clears throat] [Sean chuckles] You shouldn't be that kid's role model, Jimmy. Really? [Sean] Just let the kid be. [Jimmy exhales] Hey, Frankie, where the fuck is Judge? Do you want an answer from me? You better ask politely Well, he's the one that called us here and he said it was urgent. He's taking his sweet time, so... I think it's only fair we drink for free until he gets here. Please. Would you like a beer, Sean? [Sean] Yes. [both chuckle] Sean, you're such a kind and intelligent man. For the life of me, I can't figure out why to choose -to spend your time with this asshole. -[Sean chuckles] You're better than him. That one hurts, Frankie. Probably because you know it's true. [Jimmy] Touché. [Jimmy chuckles] Tina's moving to Chicago, Jimmy. Yeah? Shit, man. I'm sorry, dude. You know, like they say, there's plenty of fish in the sea, right? Maybe next time you could find a girlfriend that actually likes me. Huh? [chuckling] Let's go. Oh, if it isn't the man who kept us all waiting. [suspenseful music] [Judge] You guys do any work in the past couple of months independent to me? [Jimmy] Why, you jealous? No, I'm fucking aggravated. Pair of goons came in here yesterday asking about a two man crew. White and Black. Operating south shore and Boston. Did you tell them we're willing to travel to Western Mass and the Cape if the price is right? I'm fucking serious, Jimmy. Who did you beat? These guys are for real. No one important. Some cash jobs. Poker games and shit. [Sean] It was that fucking bookie. [Judge] What fucking bookie? Give the fucking money! [body thuds] I told you no to hit him. These fucking Italians from Eastie and the North End think they're gangsters 'cause their uncles were. Jesus fucking Christ, Jimmy. This is why you vet people before you stick them. So you don't step on the wrong fucking toes. They left alone yesterday but they're gonna keep asking questions, and eventually some asshole's gonna shit his pants when they walk through his door. And they're gonna say, "White and Black stick up crew? You must be talking about Sean and Jimmy. They're Judge's guys." And then I'm getting popped inside my bar that I worked my whole fucking life for! No one's getting popped in here. Oh, yeah? What the fuck are you gonna do about it? We'll find them before they find us. It just might come to that. I know a guy. Yeah. I think that he can settle this. I'm gonna make a call and see what I can do. In the meantime, you lay the fuck low. You ditch your truck. And do not go back home 'cause you don't know how far along they are. The job's still on. You call me when it's done and I'll find a place for the drop. Now get the fuck out of my bar and do not come back until we've figured this out. [Sean] Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. -[Jimmy] You're welcome. -I fucking told you not to hit that guy! [laughing] Dude, come on, are you serious? -Yeah, I'm fucking serious. -Oh, my God, dude. How many times have people threatened to kill us before? That lady from the laundromat? She fucking told me she was gonna kill me and fuck the first row at the funeral last week. -You just made that shit up. -No, I swear to Christ, bro. I looked it up. It's a Serbian insult. -Jimmy. Jimmy. -Good one. This isn't a fucking empty threat. We got guys actively searching for us. Look, you have to make a choice. If you're gonna be a criminal, you fucking own it. Be a criminal. If you're gonna be a killer, be a killer. But you can't have it both ways. Either you are a willing participant, or you're a citizen. And if you're in it, you fucking own it. Dude, what the fuck are you talking about? Judge says he's gonna talk to someone but you wanna jump straight to fucking murder. It's not fucking murder if they're trying to get you. It's fucking self-defense! Look, Judge can politic all he wants but if these fucking cunts show their face I'm gonna fucking handle it. And you can either help me, or you can go be a citizen. Or run off to fucking Chicago. [Anthony] Hey, Benny. I took the boys to see one of them superhero movies this weekend, fucking awesome. Way better than when I was a kid. They sucked back then. Special effects are much better these days. Yeah. The acting, directing, the whole nine yards, I liked it a lot. Martin Scorsese says those aren't really movies. Really? I'll have Martin come in here and tell me to my fucking face. -Where is this fucking kid? -You know something? How did this guy become a, a made guy, Carlo? -What do you think? He bought his button. -I figured that. He's gonna show up here with those shoes he bought 20 years ago. -He thinks he is Johnny Cash with those shoes. -[chuckles] Pointy, shiny, he's all greased up, this guy. What do you expect from a kid from East Boston, Benny D. You know they're always wanting to be North End fucking guys, so. -[doorbell chimes] -Ah, he's finally here, this half a fucking greasy prick. [Anthony] Yeah, he's always fucking late. -[Anthony] Hey! -[Carlo] Hey. Been a while. -What's the word on the street kid? -Yeah, yeah You're still with that nice piece of ass from Hyde Park? Nah, we're done. -She smartened up, huh? -I guess so. Only time I'm getting fucked these days is by the Department of Family and Probate. -Don't need both. -Yeah. It's never a good time to see you, Carlos. What the fuck are you here for? What do you want? I love this guy. It's all business with him. See you don't wanna know about any of my bullshit or anything like that. Just straight to business. What do you want? Let's be fair. Last time I saw you here at North End, a year ago, Fishermen's Feast. He's got a point. I heard you two were going after guys that work for a guy that works for me. Stick up guys. -You know what I'm talking about. -No. Well, I need you to back off. As a favor to me. Why the fuck would we do you any favors? [laughs] -[speaking Italian] -Look at me. -How long you know me now? -Long time. If I could do you this favor, Carlo, I would. But this favor I cannot do, my friend. These orders come from... Really? Artie T gave that order? 'Cause I thought this had something to do with Sal the bookie. No. Salvy was the last straw. These kids' been pissing off a lot of important people. Very serious people. Serious people? -Fuck them. -[chuckles] Fuck them! [sighs] -Drinks are on me, fellas. -Not necessary. [Carlo] I'll see you at the next feast! Go back to East Boston where you belong, Carlo. [doorbell chimes] Are you fucking crazy? Artie T? That's a lie that can get us clipped, Anthony. -Please. -What the fuck? Like I'm gonna lose money so that fucking little prick can collect his nut. Fuck that, Benny D. He's not gonna go to Artie T and talk about a hit. Don't worry about nothing. We'll be fine. -Come on. Salud. -[glasses clinking] Those two are the biggest fucking [indistinct] in all of North End. Dumb fucking guinea fucks. -[Judge on phone] Hello? -[Carlo] Hey, Judge. It's taken care of. So my boys are in the clear? Yeah, my guy will be by tonight for the money. [Judge sighs, chuckles] Thank Christ. I thought that shit was gonna spiral. [ominous music] [Sean] So what are you gonna do on your last day in Quincy? -[Tina] First of all, fuck Quincy. -[Sean] Wow. [Tina] I've definitely had enough days here to last me a lifetime. -[Sean] Fair. -[Tina] So I'd like to go to the Cape today. -[Sean] The Cape? -[Tina] Yeah. You know, get some good food, -get high on the beach. -[Sean] You know there's beaches in Quincy, right? [Tina] Listen, you asked me where I wanted to go. And what I wanted to do on my last day. -On my last day. -[Sean] Fair. Okay. Understood. -[Tina] You're gonna follow me to Chicago... -[Sean] Wow. ...but you won't drive an hour in the same state? [Sean] All right. [chuckling] All right. [sighs deeply] [Tina] So my friend told me about the psychic there. This guy is really good. [Sean] Like, come on, Tina. My Mother would be rolling in her grave over that shit. -[Tina] Really? -[Sean] She'd classify that as some sort of devil worshiping shit. [Tina] Well, what do you believe? [Sean] I don't know what I believe. How was it? [Tina] It was, uh... ...overwhelming. The things that he knew. Like what? He said, um, that someone close to me had passed away recently. But they were watching over me. Like... ...studying me. It made me think of my cousin. [voice breaking] He said my grandparents miss me. That they're keeping an eye on me too. [sobbing softly] [solemn music] I'm sorry, Tina. But this is exactly why I didn't wanna come here with you in the first place. This is what these people do. They're fucking crooks. They make vague comments about death because everybody knows somebody who died. They tug at your heart strings. So you keep paying and paying. Yeah, but, Sean... He knew more than that. Like, He said... He knew that I was gonna leave to discover a new city soon, but that I'd be back to Quincy soon enough. I mean, even if he guessed about my grandparents and my cousin, how did he know that? [sighs] When you made you appointment he looked you up. -[scoffs] -All he needs is your name and he can find anything on you. First of all, I'm not, like, posting all over the internet that we're moving to Chicago. And, second... I didn't tell him my name. I didn't make an appointment. I just walked in. [solemn music] -[Judge] Hey, baby. -Hey, honey. Francesca, I'm calling it a night. You coming? Oh, not yet, honey. I need to check the cash and balance out the drawer. You go on without me. -I'll, I'll catch soon, okay? -Alright. Did you call the boys yet? Tell them the good news? No. I'm gonna let them sit and sweat. Let them think about what they did. Jimmy needs to squirm. Mm-hmm. Come on, don't be too late, okay? -No, I won't. I'll see you soon. -Alright. [Sean] I wish I could come with you now. [Tina] Then come with me. [Sean] Not that simple. It would be if you couldn't rely on your business partner. Yeah, well... [Sean sighs] What's wrong? Nothing. We'll be okay. It's just a week. Yeah. You're right. Don't forget the subletter's coming on Tuesday and I need you to give her the keys. Fine. I'll take care of it. Don't make me wait for you, Sean. [gentle music] [fridge door opens] [bottles clinking] -The fuck are you doing over there? -[Benny] I'm getting -something to eat. What the fuck do you think I'm doing? -[Chuckles] Now you're hungry? [Benny] All this guys has is cold fucking pizza. Can you fucking believe this? -Please, give me a break. -Oh. [Anthony shushes] Come on. I think I hear him coming. [Benny] What the fuck, Anthony. Why are you always so fucking dramatic with this, "Hide in the fucking dark" bullshit? Benny D. it's all about the presentation, brother. You should know that. I think he's coming now. [door opens] [door closes] Surprise, fuckface. Have a seat, please. Do me a favor. Take a deep breath, relax. Please have a seat and make yourself comfortable. Do me that favor. I just wanna talk to you. Didn't you talk to Carlo? Shut the fuck up about fucking Carlo, sit the fuck down and don't interrupt! Forget about Carlo. Sit down for a minute. I just wanna talk to you. I'm your friend. Come on. We've talked before. Sit down. Look at me. You doing alright? Take a deep breath. -You remember us, right? -[Judge] Yeah. Good. This won't have to be redundant over here, going over shit you should already know. -Correct? -Yeah. This is a big night for you, Judge. This is the night you get to decide what kinda man you're gonna be. Me, honestly, I'm hoping you're a smart man. A man who knows he's got one life, one chance at all this, and he better make the most of it. Go out and get drunk, smoke a little weed, make love to your beautiful Brazilian wife-- -[Benny] Let me tie this motherfucker... -[Anthony laughs] [Benny] ...or I'll fuck his wife and smash him in the fucking skull-- [speaks Italian] In the end, a man who knows loyalty is for the weak. Not a person on Earth worth giving their life up for. Then again, I have been wrong, once or twice. Maybe you're one of them guys that would give his life up for some so-called friend that would never return the favor. Give up his entire existence and for what, Judge? Pride? Principles? Ego? Now, we spoke to you before and you lied to us. -[Benny speaking Italian] -[mumbles in Italian] Well, tonight, it's time to put the lies to bed. Tonight you will decide what kinda man you're gonna be. [suspenseful music] [knocking on door] [shower running] [Sean] Yeah? [Corky] Hey, Sean, uh, it's, uh, it's Corky. What's up, Sean? What's going on? Not that much. Oh, how's, how's Tina doing? She's fine. You know, um, my grandparents live, like, across the street from her. I practically grew up over there. Yeah, this is, like, the sixth time you've told me that. Yeah, just my thoughts. Yeah. [chuckles] Is, uh, is Jimmy, Jimmy here? No. -He's, uh, he's not in the, the shower? -Nah. -I just heard it, I just heard it running, so I-- -Yeah, I'm warming it up. [Jimmy] Sean! Sean, have you been using my fucking dandruff shampoo? What do you need Jimmy for? I just-- I was thinking, I had this idea. It couldn't work but, uh, it would need, like, three, it'd need three guys. Can I give you some advice? Yeah, sure. If you're looking for a man to look up to, it's not me... ...and as sure as fuck not him. You want a male role model? Go home, throw on some Fresh Prince, watch some Uncle Phil or some shit. But stop coming around here trying to get involved. -Is that clear? -Yeah. Sorry, Sean. Sorry, Sean. No worries. -See you. -Take care of yourself, Corky. -Yeah. Sorry, Sean. -Yeah. [footsteps receding] [door slams] [Jimmy] I feel like I'm forgetting something. [Sean] It's all in the bag. Come on, man, we need to get moving. We're not even supposed to be here. Wish those fucks would come through here, right now. Make our self-defense case a little easier. Let's just fucking go, Jimmy. You know, what if Corky was in on this? He'll be like our personal assistant, help us with the bags, inventory, shit like that. You need to fucking drop that, man. It's not even something to be considered. You are such a fucking wet blanket. Everybody's saying that. Everybody can go kick fucking rocks. [laughing] [knocking on door] Yeah? [Stephanie] Jimmy, it's Stephanie. [mouthing] Motherfucker. Hold on. Sean's naked. He's got that weird thing with his penis. [Stephanie] Open the door. -Hi, Stephanie. -Hi, Jimmy. Hey, Sean. There you are, fully clothed. How's it going? Hmm. Where are you two headed tonight with the matching outfits? Ha! Look at that. Great minds, you know. You're so full of shit. But I don't have fucking time for this tonight. I need you to pee in this. This is legitimately fucking with our friendship. Like, I feel like I can't trust you. You can't call, tell me you're coming over? Just because I like you, Jimmy, doesn't mean I'm your friend, okay? Now go piss in this so I can get going. How many times do I gotta tell you? I don't do drugs. The D.A.R.E. program works. No bullshit. [opens and closes door] [calm music on radio] [Jimmy] Put your hands back on the fucking wheel. Put your hands on the wheel, now! [Sean shouts] Do what the fuck he said! There we go. Now, my man here, is going to take the pistol off your waist. You understand what will happen if you try anything? Nod your fucking head if you understand what will happen. There we go. Oh, yeah, we knew about that one too. Now, get the fuck outta the car. [Phil stumbles] [Jimmy] So, Phil... ...you're house is a dump and you look poor as shit. So, unless you're a complete fucking moron, you've already gathered that we're not here for your, uh, Woody Allen DVD box set or signed copy of Rosemary's Baby. [chuckles] We know you got guns. We know you got a lot, a lot more of them. So, tell us where they are, and we'll be on our way. Don't tell us and we'll find them anyway. My man here, is a fucking blood hound. [suspenseful music] Phil, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot, her. I mean, I know I'm basically ruining your fantasy. And you've always dreamed of killing someone that broke into your house. Who that person is, well, that's up for debate. But we'll find out next in "Who's Phill wanna kill?" [vocalizing] Let's meet our first contestant. What's your name, son? Oh, he's shy. Okay. Well, Phil, we'll make it easy. We'll do multiple choice. First question, for zero dollars. You're home alone, making whoopie, there's a noise outside. Oh, God. You've got 80 guns to choose from. Who do you most wanna see walk through that door? Would it be, A, addicts, B, Black people, C, queers or maybe liberals, or D, definitely not me. Am I right? [laughing] Whoever it might be... ...in this moment, I see, it is me. Oh, it's me, 'cause you think that I robbed you of your big moment to stand your ground. [door opening and creaking] The fuck? You see, it's come to my attention that you have an issue with alcohol and drugs. It is my contention that it's that very issue that robbed you of your killer instinct here tonight. So, in conclusion, Phil, I want you to think of tonight... ...as an intervention. The motivation you need to live a sober life. You're welcome. [chuckles] [farts] [laughing] Not even a fucking smile? [Sean] Jimmy! What? I'm sorry, Phil, this is wildly unacceptable and unprofessional. We'll be back right after these messages. Hey, remember that whole "Don't use names during a robbery" thing? [eerie music] [thud] [Phil panting] [Jimmy] Who's the boy? [whimpering] I... I didn't mean to hurt him. He liked it when I choked him when we'd make love. And... [sobbing] ...he asked me to do it! I didn't mean to hurt him, man. I loved him so much, man. I would never ever hurt him, man. I would never hurt that little boy. You gotta just believe me, man. I love him so much. [sobbing] And he loved me. He fucking loved me, man. [Jimmy] What was his name? His name was Tyler. And he was my best friend, man! I loved him. Please! Just go! Just take your fucking guns and go, man. Just trust me, go! And fucking let me go, man. Please, I'll do-- I won't even tell them your name, man. I don't know your name. -Just fucking don't kill me, please! -My name is Tyler. -[Phil] Come on, man-- -[gunshot] [gunshot ringing echoes] [Richard] You're moving to a new city. And you'll be back before you think... [gentle music] [Richard] ...before you want. [footsteps approaching] [suspenseful music] [loud thud] [groans softly] Alright. What the fuck did I tell you? I'm sick and tired of sitting in that fucking stinky fucking car. -Okay? -Benny D, how many fucking years we been doing this now, huh? It's part of the job, man. Snap the fuck out of it. -I'm bored out of my fucking mind, Anthony. -Bored, huh? Really -Yeah. -Coming from a guy who fucking bird watches for a hobby. -You're bored? -Birds are a lot more interesting than people, okay? A lot more interesting. [gate creaks] [suspenseful music] Have I ever shown any desire to listening to radio shows? -It's not the fucking point-- -Aye, Jim. -Motherfucker! -Fuck you! Fuck you! [Benny] Where do you think you're fucking going? [Corky] Fuck! [tense music] I'm fucking starving. [exhales] You trying to go to Dunks? You fucking deaf? I gotta go, man. Go where? I got to get the fuck out of here. Well, yeah. Agreed. We gotta get that Dunk's trip. Mm. Besides that though, it's probably good if we stay here until we clear up this other thing. I'm not talking about going to the apartment, Jimmy. I'm fucking leaving. I'm taking my share of the guns and I'm going to Chicago to be with Tina. -The fuck are you talking about? -I can't-- I can't do this anymore, man. [scoffs] -Is this because of last night? -[scoffs] It's not just that. But, fuck, yeah! Last night didn't fucking help! You feel bad about that piece of shit? I just want to be with Tina, man. I don't want this shit. I didn't want any of this shit. Oh. So, so this isn't a spur of a moment thing. This was the plan all along. That's fucking rich, Sean. We got guys out there looking to kill us for something that we did. But, no. You go run to Tina. Please. Yeah. Don't worry, man. I got this. -I'll take care of it myself. -[gun clicks] [door opens and closes] [melancholic music] [Tina] Don't make me come back to Quincy, Sean. [Sean] Why would you? [Tina] You. You're the only thing I have left here. Don't make me come back here for you. I told you I was coming to Chicago, right? Believe that. I'm coming. [suspenseful music] [door creaks] [suspenseful music] [exhales] Jimmy, get back up there and tell Corky to come down here. He ain't up there. That piece of shit. What kind of son lies to his mother? He told me that he was gonna grab my cigarettes after he came to see you. It's been like two fucking hours now. He didn't come to see you and apparently, I don't have my cigarettes. 'Cause I'm still standing here feeling like a motherfucker about to walk my skinny ass down to Cumbi's. -I gotta go. -Jimmy. Jimmy, can I at least bum a square? Come on! [tense music] [phone vibrating] Come on, Sean. [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating] Sean, answer the fucking phone! [phone vibrating] [tires squealing] Sean! Sean! We gotta-- We gotta move. They got Corky. What do you mean they got Corky? They got Corky, they've been to our apartment. Corky knows this spot. we gotta fucking move. [suspenseful music] [panting] [car peels out] Go around the block again, I saw a few parking spots back there. That skinny fucking cocksucker, he cracked me pretty good. Ugh. -Do I need stitches? -No, you'll be alright. Just a paper cut. You took it well. Oh, shit. What are you doing? Something's stuck here. Oh, shit. -Look at this. Yeah! Come on! -It's that prick's fucking tooth. -Get it outta my face. -Take it home. Throw it underneath the pillow tonight. -Give it to the tooth fairy. -Get that fucking tooth -outta my face. That's disgusting. -[laughs] -[speaks in Italian] -Looks like a molar. Oh, fuck it. Sorry. I know I'm an asshole. [door creaking] Frankie. If you're looking for Judge, he's not in. Where is he? We need to see him and he's not answering his phone. He had some business out of state. When will he be back? None of your fucking business, Jimmy. Frankie, Frankie... ...we gotta talk to him. I haven't heard from him. If you wanna wait, sit down and I'll make you two a drink. Yeah? She's gonna make us a drink. [door creaking] [Jimmy] He gave us up. No. We tied him to a murder, he's in the wind. Judge tells Frankie everything. We weren't supposed to be in the bar just now. He told us. He said, we weren't supposed to come back until he took care of this hitters thing. What are we gonna do? [gentle music] I want you to go to Chicago, Sean. This is something I signed up for. You got something else in mind. It's fine. I know what you did coming back to Tina's. For all you knew, they were right outside. And you came back for me. I'm not running. [Benny] Hey, Anthony, this is a lot of work for $7500. Three for the price of two. -Huh. -What are we? Bargain-basement hitmen now? [Anthony] You remember them fucking two stick-up boys -back in Framingham that time, right? -Yeah. Good payday when the job was done, got a QP of coke from them as well. Who knows what these boys will be holding. Did you see their apartment? These guys got nothing They got stugotz. I'm not made of money like you, Benny D. I promised my kids a trip to Disney this Christmas. I do what I gotta do and I don't squawk about it. Not for nothing, that plastic gangster Sal he deserved to get fucking robbed, okay. And now, we gotta whack these two poor mamelukes because of Sal's insecurities? We're here playing Sherlock and Holmes -chasing these guys around everywhere. -[laughs] I want a tall whiskey, I want the Bruins game, that's it. Why you laughing? [speaking Italian] It's not Sherlock and Holmes. It's Sherlock and Watson. [Benny] Whatever. [Anthony] What's this? What the fuck is this? Pizza? -They're always fucking hungry. -[Benny] Oh, no, delivery. [Anthony] Oh, shit. When did they get here? [gunshots] [car siren] [dogs barking] [gentle music] [music stops] I'm meeting up with Smiley today. I know you want to get your cash and bounce but it's not that easy anymore. I'm gonna see if Smiley will trade the guns for some dope. I know that sounds fucked up. Like I planned this shit. But... It is what it is, Sean. Judge fucked us. Just trying to adapt and overcome here, you know. It's all good. I'd like you to come with me. You don't have to come in. Just... stay in the car across the street. So he sees I'm not alone. I thought this was your guy. He was. But so was Judge. [knocking on door] [knocking intensifies] -Who is it? -[Kim] Kim. Hold on, Kim. -Jimmy, I still haven't heard from Corky. -Oh, I'm sure he's fine. No, he hasn't called Jimmy. He never stays out all night and doesn't call me. He's a good-looking kid. Maybe he met a girl-- Jimmy, I'm gonna call the cops. Something is not right. No. No one's calling the cops. I'll go look for him, okay? -You will? -Yeah. I'll go look for him right now. Put some clothes on. Thank you so much, Jimmy. [voice breaks] I'm so worried. I'll call you as soon as I find him, alright? -[sobbing] -I will. Alright. Alright, keep your phone on. Jimmy! What's up, Smiley? Oh, man. Come here, man. Give me some love. Good to see you, brother. It's good to see you, man. What you want? Some espresso, some cappuccino, -some brekky? -I'm good with a brekky but can we talk blikkies. If we doing drug deals in a coffee shop, better get your hands on a goddamn coffee. [laughing] Fair enough. [Tina] I got a call from a detective, Sean. A detective? About what? Two men were murdered on my street, few houses down from my place. So why would the police wanna talk to you? I guess there was a pizza guy there when it happened. Someone had called and ordered pizzas from my address and the guy was right there when the men were killed. Someone ordered pizzas to your house? [chuckles] Yeah, I guess so. I told the detective it could've been you. But he said no one was home when they went to check. Yeah. I was at my spot last night. I know. And I told them that. He just wants you to go in and tell him the same thing. Yeah. Okay, let me get his number. Sean. Yeah? If Jimmy has anything to do with this, don't protect him. You can't. Tina, what the fuck are you talking about? Why would Jimmy have anything to do with this? Don't treat me like I'm stupid, Sean. I know exactly who Jimmy is. And so do you. Don't act like anything is impossible for him. I don't think he was a part of this. I was with him all night. When are you coming? I'll come tonight. [laughing] What? What was the old timer's name? The big Black guy, sat with, uh, Marques and Derek? -[Smiley] Jeff. -Fucking Jeff. [laughing] Oh, shit. Fucking Jeff, the kid walks up, fucking Jeff puts him in a head lock, whips out his dick and smashed him in the face with it! [laughs] Over and over again. Oh, man. That was bad, man. Oh, my-- Dude. Poor bastard. I mean, Jeff had, what, six inches on him, soft? [laughing] Yeah, shit. Smiley, man... ...I ended up with some guns. My buyer fell through. So I'm hoping we could make a deal here. What kind of guns? All kinds. You think you don't need guns in the dope game? Come on, man. You're smarter than that. Bunch of wolves out here. Well, it's all I got. So, do you want them? Or not? I like you, Jimmy. I appreciate everything you did for me on the inside. Likewise. You believe in God? No. Yeah. Me neither. But I believe in energy. We all give off energy. Positive and negative Certain things we do, they create a type of energy you'll never shed. No matter how hard you try. And that negativity, it only attracts more. You see what I'm saying? Not really. You be careful what you put out into this world, man. Don't be surprised if it finds its way back to you. Do you want the guns or not? Yeah. [Jimmy] Smiley wasn't kidding about this brekky. Fucking delicious. [Sean] A detective called Tina. He wants to talk to me. What'd he say? They wanted to know why a pizza guy was delivering food to her apartment at the same time two guys got killed a few houses down. Okay. It was to be expected. Really? As we talked through this plan, you never said it was to be expected. Well yeah, Sean. I mean, what would be the fucking point of that? You already had enough on your mind. What the fuck am I gonna say to him? They'll call you in, I'll be next. We lawyer up. Keep our mouths shut. Simple as that. They're gonna know, Jimmy. [scoffs] Yeah. They'll know. [scoffs] But there's no guns. Phones are good. Did you come on his face after you shot him? No. Okay, perfect. No DNA. I guess we're good. It's not as simple as that, Jimmy. They're gonna know it's us. There's something we're not thinking of. Look, they can know all they want. But they can't prove anything. And that's all that fucking matters here. [phone vibrating] Un-fucking-believable. Where the fuck have you been? [Judge] Those two fucking goons came back to the bar. I made it out the back before they saw me. I had to go underground until I heard everything was all right. Oh, yeah? I still want what we talked about. Name a time and place. Three o'clock, the bog. [hangs up] You said Smiley went for the deal. [chuckling] Yeah, he did. So who are you lying to? [farts] [Jimmy laughing] I am so proud of you, man. Fuck. There was a day, not too long ago, when a fart that loud, in a car, with the windows up, would've lost your cool. You've come a long way, Sean. Maturity wise. [chuckles] I gotta take a wicked shit. Come on, man. Hold it. You remember the battle of Helm's Deep? What? The Two Towers. The orcs and the battering ram, trying to take down the door. [Sean] The fuck are you talking about? [Jimmy] That's what my asshole is doing right fucking now. -I gotta stop. -Fine. Dude, fuck! [Jimmy] I'll just be two seconds. I'm not having the best day. Can I please just have your car? And your phone. Thank you very much. Hey, how do I move the seat back? [tires screech] [phone vibrating] The fuck, Jimmy? Hurry up, man. [Jimmy] I think you should go to Chicago. -What're you doing? -Listen to me. I got 20k in a storage locker. The key is under my mattress. Consider that your half of the guns, alright? I don't give a shit about the money. Stop fucking around, Jimmy. I'm coming with you. -Not today my friend. -Don't do this alone, man. -We don't know what they know! -Send Tina my love.

Where's Sean? Oh, Sean retired. Just me now. So those guys over in Quincy who got wet last night. That was just you? Ah. And the job? That was all me. [chuckling] Let's get the shit and let's get the fuck outta here. [laughing] Whoa! Jimmy! -The fuck? -It was us or you. -You chose you, right? -Oh, Jimmy, you're wrong. We're family. They killed my guy, Judge. He was a fucking kid. It wasn't me. Jimmy, I swear to God. Please. Don't do this. You don't trust me. That's fine. But you and me, we don't gotta end like this. Let's get back in our cars and we'll just go our separate ways. [scoffs] That other guy you put us onto, he killed the kid. I know. It's all over the fucking news this morning. He deserved to die. Why is fucking haunting me then, huh? It'll pass, kid. It will pass. You just gotta give it time. You didn't leave anything behind, right? Nothing to connect the dots? Then you're gonna be okay. [gun clicks] [suspenseful music] How 'bout we get back in our cars? Go our separate ways? Sorry. It can't be that way. Sean's out the game, okay? You leave him out of it, alright? Sure, kid. Hey, Frankie. How about one more dance? Close your eyes, baby. [gunshot] [Richard] You have your mother's eyes. She said you have her smile too, but you don't use that much anymore. [Sean] Is that what you do? What? You guess at loved ones people have lost. Say some fucked up shit like, "You have the same smile." -So I sit here and cry? -I don't want you to cry. If something comes because of something said in this room, then I hope it helps. I hope you find it therapeutic. See, I don't need therapy. And if I did, it wouldn't be here. You know, she said this is the last place on Earth -she wants you to be. -Yeah. 'Cause people like you, you go against God. That's not why she said it. Tell me why you're so unhappy. I thought you're supposed to tell me. [sighs] Um... Um, I... ...I'm looking for my friend. He left me... ...and he went somewhere dangerous. I got there as soon as I could. I know something bad happened to him. I can feel it in my bones. I just gotta know where he is. I just gotta see him again. You have lived many lives, many lives. in which you were many races. Your friend... ...you and he have been a part of each other's lives, time and time and time and time and time and time again. You were brothers before. He was your father once. You're not answering my question-- You'll never see him again. Not as you knew him. Not in this life. But your souls. Your souls will know each other again one day. Tell me where he-- Tell me where he is. What do you know about the Big Bang, Sean? Fuck do I need to know about the Big Bang? What the fuck has that got to do with what I'm asking you? You want to know where your friend is. Look no further than the death of the stars. The principals of the solar system. [Sean] What the fuck is that supposed to mean? This was the right decision. I know. Stop feeling bad about it, Sean. There's nothing you could have done to save him. I don't know about that. [creaking noise from downstairs] [laughing] [crying] I'm sorry. -[sobs] -[banging on door] [man] Police, open up. [Richard] But you'll be back home before you think. Before you want.
