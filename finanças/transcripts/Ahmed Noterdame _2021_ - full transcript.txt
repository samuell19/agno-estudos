Are you crazy about the social media sites? Don't say that, please I did many journalistic reports and uploaded it on social media which helped to solve many crimes Since you are so successful what is you analysis about the case of the Metro serial killer? I can't say a word in it It need a specialist's opinion Like whom? I have an interview tomorrow with a specialist in crime science He'll solve it out He is Dr. Nahed El Kharbotly - Who is he? - He is a great researcher He has a PHD degree in the criminal psychology Moreover, he writes scary stories and crime novels There is a new and important development in the Metro serial killer's case who is our main subject now It seems that he'll get imprisoned soon Because the district attorney found out the first strong evidence against him Here in our studio Mr. Adely El Feki the manager of Kalb El Hadath site - Hello - Is there any new updates? The updates, Mr. Sherif, is that Mrs Naglaa Abo El Ela El Shawfy disappeared for 5 days now In her last phone call to her sister she saw someone who stared in a creepy way to her. She took a photo of him without his notice - She sent it to her sister - There are 2 persons in the photo Their faces aren't clear One only is so clear The person sitting in the middle has a creepy stare He looks so weird, it seems that he is closer to be the culprit The police men exerted many efforts and they discovered that he is a dangerous criminal His name is Khamis El Garboo He has 3 cases of harassment and 4 cases robbery with violence - They are searching for him - Please, could you zoom in the photo so that our viewers could see his face very well? Are you afraid of death? Whenever anyone dies it is for his benefit This world is born innocent and pure But you filled it with betrayal You got Adam out of Heaven! There is no one in this world but one woman only I found in her innocence. Izmeralda... Izmeralda, my dear love Izmeralda Why are you looking to her like that, Izmeralda? Do you pity her? Don't pity her! You are not like them. You are an angel Those are evil My dear love I don't want to torture you and get you out in this bad world I'll get you in the only place where you'll maintain your pure soul in I'll keep you away! If they saw this man in any place they must inform the officials Do they think that they will outsmart me? Is this the genius man who will analyze our crime? You brought me to a man who is feeding some sheep? He looks like a cowboy but don't worry he is genius - Don't think that he feeds sheep only - Then what? - He thinks too - That way? May, why are you doing so? Since your birth date and I said that you were naughty Amina, why don't you eat? - Abo El Naga? - Yes, sir Didn't I say that it is prohibited to let the male get close from the sheep? He is bound to this post as you see him - It isn't enough - Why, sir? Did anything happen? - Amina is pregnant - He is a genius He caught a case of indecency in a minute I apologize because I left you but it is the feeding time - of May, Amina and Carla - May God protect them - and you marry them - We understood who is May and Amina - why did you name this one Carla? - Her mum is a Lebanon Despite your family, what is your opinion in what we told you? It seems from what I heard and the videos which I saw about this serial killer and his devilish murder methods to women This confirms that he has an issue with all females Why does he take the left leg from his victims? No, honestly, doctor What we didn't tell the public is that he take everytime a different part from each victim How could you hide such an important information? Because it may cause a great disturbance to the people and let them feel fear This means that he wants to reach a purpose - What is it, doctor? - To answer such a subject I need some boiled ginger Karawya with 2 leaves and half Guava Why, Doctor? Do we have pneumonitis? Calm down According to the criminal psychological theories I could tell you that Khamis El Garboo is impossible to be our culprit He could steal a bag or harrass a woman but to do such crimes, I don't think so This was my opinion too, Doctor From the pictures which you brought with you here I saw that the serial killer took from the first victim her rib cage and the second victim, the left hand The third victim, the right hand the fourth victim, the left leg I think that this man wants to create a whole body This means that he will commit more crimes? - Exactly - Did you notice the way of amputating? Did you see how accurate did he skin her rib cage? - What is it? - See what does this crow want I don't need anymore tension When a crow keeps quacking he wants to warn his friends that there is a bloody invasion from the Eagles Help, Doctor. Amina is killed She isn't Amina. It is Soha Abo El Naga, get my firearm quickly The hyaenas attacked us Oh dear! Thunder, rain and killed sheep - It is a miserable night - I got in a lot of trouble Since then and I can't hold my tempers Didn't you beg me to come here? Endure it What I'm so curious about, are you interested in all the crimes you work on? No way! This time the serial killer targets women I could have been instead of them I feel that they are searching for the wrong person If they caught El Garboo I think the crimes will continue With due respect to all what Mr Crombo whom we visited all of this is only conclusions It may be an illusion How is he living in such a scary place? I don't know Does Dr. El Kharbotly have friends who come visit him in this remote place? Dr. El Kharbotly can't befriend anyone but two Either Dracula or Frankstein Take care! I'm sorry. I was so afraid I'm sorry. I was so afraid Why are you sorry? It is a frightening situation - Yes - I got so shocked - Yes, me too - Yes, ok What is this? Is there a moon roof in your car? - Yes - Is it more expensive - or the car dealer didn't see it? - Yes, a lot What do you mean by that you don't know? Wasn't he living in this apartment? - Isn't it in your building? - Sir, this is an illegal building No one lives in it. Since I built it it had a demolition order - I keep visiting the court hall - Yes, how did he live here? I swear that I didn't know He lived by force in this apartment Yes, sir. No, everything is alright, sir Yes, sir. I'm sure of it He left a letter with his handwritten confession too Moreover, all his previous victims objects are here too in the apartment We succeeded by your instructions, sir Good bye What brought you here? - I follow my work - How come, Doctor? Did you forget that you are suspended and will be investigated too? He has a criminal history. He left a letter with his handwritten confessions Moreover, his finger prints are everywhere in the apartment If everyone took care of his work we wouldn't have been that way Ahmed, do you believe that the Garboo is the serial killer? Even if I didn't believe it the man wrote a letter confessing with all what he did in Moreover, they found his corpse in the same place where he kills his victims You are right. Although all the evidence and facts say that the Garboo is the serial killer my heart tells me the opposite Didn't it tell you any other thing? No, Ahmed. I don't like to get near this thing at all Why? Is it a mines field? Listen, I had a failed experience I married for 5 years, we had many fights because of my work Why? Did you take the corpses with you to your home? He kept accusing me of neglecting him and my work took all my time But your job is so hard to be honest No one could marry a coroner too By the way, I could marry a veterinarian I hope she is sweet and pretty like you Ahmed, please, don't open such subjects I didn't open anything You kept saying, these things and mines Do you know? The view from here is wonderful Is this the first time to see the 6th of October from up here? - What is this thing? - This is Arkan and this is Dandy Mall This is Hyper Market, Abla What is the real name of El Garboo? Since I knew him, they called him that - Yes, was he born here? - Yes, sir. He was born and bred... What is this? Am I asking you about Taha Hussien? He is a murderer Did you notice from El Garboo's acts that he could kill that way? No one believes that he could do so Yes, he was a moron and bastard but not to the extent of murder Since he divorced his wife from 3 years ago, no one saw his face again As we accustomed you to see new exclusive updates now the first exclusive interview with the ex-wife of El Garboo She is his divorcee. Azza El Efish Can you tell me what is the reason behind your divorce? He was a womanizer and he harassed women What? Didn't he call you since the divorce? No, I didn't see him for 3 years He didn't think of visiting his kids May he rest in peace What is his motive to let El Garboo do such crimes? - I hate him, but he can't kill - Why? Is he an architect? He confessed and left a letter with his handwriting too What letter, sir? He is illiterate He can't read or write What? Really? Can I know what is the important thing which let me get out late from my house? - I'll explain and tell you everything - Who is he? Am I an Uber driver? I'm his friend Calm down, Shaker. He is my friend and we do all our journalistic reports together Moreover, he is genius in using the computer - That's true - Did I come down to be introduced - to Bill Gates here? - What is it? Calm down - Didn't you ask him? - Are you going to fight? The problem is Shaker made a journalistic report with Khamis El Garboo's wife We found an important thing which you must see for yourself What letter, sir? He is illiterate He can't read or write What letter, sir? He is illiterate He can't read or write - Did you believe me? - You were right Do you know guys? As soon as I upload this video on our site it will be a trend in one hour - Excuse me, we can't upload it at all - Why? Why, you party spoiler? See her, Ahmed - Calm down - If it did and the real serial killer saw it, he will do all his precautions and he could disappear forever Do you mean that we should give it to the police? They consider the case closed already The divorcee of El Garboo won't prove him innocent We need a strong evidence Oh dear! What is this depressing place? We are entering a serial killer's house is it Soheir El Bably's house? Get in! - Take care! - What? It is the crime scene marks Take care, don't step here This is El Garboo's body I mean the place where it was in - It is only it's place - What? Can't you see all those cleavers and knives? Yes, it is the tools which he slaughtered his victims with Oh God! If he were slaughtering some cows, he won't use them I hear some water drops The faucet has a problem or a cracked pipe - Excuse me, guys - Where will you go? - I'll get a plumber - Stop it! Come on, let's take a look - Won't you come with us? - No, I'm afraid. Go ahead Didn't you hear him? Go ahead - Do you want me to go alone? - No, he is an orphan with a broken tooth Walk in front of me! Listen, it is a water faucet which drips, what is our business? Let's leave God protect us Yes It is empty. Let's leave - Open the curtains - Maybe someone is taking a shower Open it Ahmed! Abla! Are you okay or should I call for help? Shaker! Shaker, my friend? My friend, what is the matter? Ahmed, a cat attacked me It must attack you, it saw a mouse in front of her - From where did it come out? - Here It looks like an extraction fan - How did she go there? - I'm not her husband to know that - Go up and see what is there - You go How? I'm wearing a skirt You go up, Ahmed - Ok - Hurry! - Entangle your hands to him - Ok Come on Oh God! Shaker, your relatives are here Hurry man, you are wearing heaving shoes - This isn't an extraction fan, guys - No, it is - No way! - Then what is it? It is a blender, no problem, guys I can't hold it - Yes, hurry - One minute Since Khamis El Garboo is an illiterate person this is skeptical. Why would an illiterate man have such books? - Especially this novel - Why? Did you want to buy it and you didn't find it? Return the banana. Return it back! - Where did you find this bag? - He hid it in a secret place It seems that from the number of books which Ahmed found that he is a well educated man and reads in general It isn't about education, Dr. Abla It seems that he is interested in it to the extent that he marked certain sentences in this novel For instance, this sentence It is proven that the soul deforms when it is in a deficient body In a deficient body. There is another important sentence here too In a deficient body. There is another important sentence here too I didn't feel my defect before now and whenever I compared between us I didn't manage to avoid my feeling of pity There are two important words in this sentence My defect and pity It seems that he has an issue and some defect How come? Will he have a calcium defect? What? Are we in Al Borg's laboratory? - Leave the apple, man - This too? - Leave it! - Ok I want to see the videos again What are you doing? Is this a camera? - Rewind this scene again - Rewind it This is the 7th time to rewind it If it were Gowhara's dance clip I won't rewind it like that What are you doing? Is this a camera? - Didn't you notice anything? - Yes He is a sadist, crazy and merciless - I mean the camera's movement - What about it, Dr. Sherif Arafa? No, I can't continue and this creature is here - You are right, Doctor - Behave, Shaker Continue, Doctor. What about it? In all the videos, the serial killer while moving towards his victim the camera shakes the same way and it means that he has something in his leg - Like what, Doctor? - Paralysis, crippled By the way, we must know if El Garboo was crippled or not How will we know it? He's dead So what? We could ask his wife or his neighbors By the way, Shaker and I made a report with all his relations They said that they didn't hear from him since 3 years They didn't see him too This means even if they said that he was intact he may have been injured recently and they don't know - Exactly - That way you have only one solution Are you sure that he told you to wait for him in the middle of the cemetery? Sure. I came to meet the cemetery man where should I wait for him? - In Star Bucks? - Hello! Why did you delay, guys? Sorry, we lost our way till we reached the location. It's not on Google Maps Since you were late let it be tomorrow - Why? Did the dead corpses leave? - We will die all - Why is he doing so? - It seems that he has peri esophagitis We can't see the dead people in such a late time No, this is an angina. What will happen if we went now? - Many things - Like what? - Oh God! - Where are you going? Come in - What? - What? - Listen, let's forget about it - Why? You seem in medicine school if you need a corpse to do autopsy? There is another one there It is fresh What? Are we going to eat it? - We need this one exactly - Why? This poor woman is spelled to not get married at all Honestly, it is buried in this grave A spell? This is what I was worried about I can't endure any genie to see me and fall in love with me so she haunts me How come? Are you a sleeping gown? Listen, we will go inside this grave and we will follow you Did you forget that you took 1000 pounds? Really? It was in the past, dear Before all these mischiefs appear to me I need another 1000 pound as a risk premium Ok, Ahmed Take this, man. Here is 1000 pounds too God help us No God but Allah! Do you know which corpse or will we search them? Yes, we know it, Khamis El Garboo's The serial killer? No, it is so dangerous Why? We don't care You took 2000 pounds till now This is the serial killer's corpse who all the Egyptians were searching for - What do you want now? - I need a 1000 pounds again - as imprisonment premium - You'll take 3000 pounds to show us Khamis El Garboo's body? How much will you take if we wanted to see Raya and Sekina's bodies? Give it to him, Ahmed, please Here is El Garboo's corpse What? Who are you? A dead man woke up - Don't be afraid, this is Sobhy - Who is he? Is he alive? - Yes. In between - Why is he sleeping in the grave? He opened it for you then he felt tired and slept He opened it for you then he felt tired and slept Get out of here! Get out, you frightened us Hold this Here is El Garboo's body - What did you find? - He's not our culprit Hurry, Mr. Shaker. You seem unable to do anything, what is it? Please, let this woman know that she talks to the Prince of Data, Ahmed - I'm Zuker Berg in Egypt - Stop it and hurry! Dr. Kharbotly, we could take this laptop drawing and this deer which is watch us and give them to the police instead No, all what we reached till now are only our conclusions To go to the police and reopen this case we must have a strong evidence Congratulations, guys This is the Metro camera's network and all it's history under your service Well done, Mr. Shaker. Take this Here are the dates and stations which the victims disappeared in Are you going to keep staring at me like that? - Go make us some tea - Sure, dear How many spoons of sugar? What are you doing here? Come on, food is ready No, you go eat. I'm not hungry now This place is so quiet but in a scary way You know? This quietness calms me down What are your problems? You keep laughing and joking - You don't think about anything - This is what you think Can't it be a way to escape something? - Like what? - Loneliness for instance Where are your parents and siblings? My parents died a long time ago I don't have anyone but one brother Why didn't you marry till now? Marriage is a big responsibility for me I kept escaping it all my life Moreover, who I met in my life didn't get affect by me or vice versa Ahmed and Abla, come in quickly Go ahead. God takes revenge from you! Is that the right time? This is Naglaa. The fifth victim El Garboo went after her and if we noticed here we'll see her waving to him nervously It seems that he harassed her and she is shouting to him She left and he followed her This is the one, Doctor Shaker, play all the videos of our victims leaving the subway If we will notice here, guys, El Garboo only appeared in Naglaa's video It is getting more complicated, Doctor Shaker, play Naglaa's video Stop it here Focus the picture on the guy who is standing there wearing a cap Here he is. Why that man specifically, Doctor? Because he appeared in all the videos, look here How did you know that he is the same person? He is wearing a cap and his face isn't clear Play the video, Shaker From his cripple If we believe that this is him why is he murdering women? In fact, the pictures which you provided me with we'll discover that the chair which he murders all his victims on there is a picture for the Hunchback of Notre-Dame in the back here His favorite novel is The Hunchback of Notre-Dame Even the lines which he marked in his novel it talks about the disabled and the physical and psychological deformation The mannequin which you found inside the bath tub When I search for it, I discovered that it is wearing Ezmeralda's costume in The Hunchback of Notre-Dame's movie - Who is she? - She is his lover who loved him despite his disability We can't understand why is he killing them? Because he can't find Ezmerald's his lover We are facing a serial killer who impersonates the Hunchback of Notre-Dame We are facing a serial killer who impersonates the Hunchback of Notre-Dame What should we do now, Doctor? - We must reach him - "Metro station" - Tell us how are you, Abla - He didn't appear yet I have a problem.

I'm so tired, Dr. Kharbotly This is the fifth station to visit People run when they see my face They have their excuse can't you see your face? Listen, Doctor Kharbotly Was the character working in metal factory? - Why? - His face melted Who made this mask is a professional What? Is it a car? Who made it was from my genius students But unfortunately, one eye is lower than the other a little bit Excuse me, when is the last subway train? What is it? Come here What is it, Ahmed? Someone got shocked after seeing my face "Warning" Mum, I lost my ball Didn't I tell you not to play with it here and wait till we go home? Excuse me, can I take the ball? Is it right to frighten the child? This is too much. I won't complete Listen, Dr. Kharbotly I'm coming out. This is an insult I could endure anything but getting slapped like that Stay there, Ahmed. If we caught the serial killer, it will be an exclusive news What? Are you talking to Messi? I'll wait Go prepare tea Hey guys! Guys! Man! Guys! Listen to me, guys.

Don't do that. Ahmed? Ahmed, we are lucky now Don't stop Don't stop so that you don't let him be suspicious - Are you sure that this is him? - Yes, sure It is the same cripple What should I do? Should I scream and gather people? What? Are you crazy? Continue Abla, start with our B plan The serial killer is following you Why are you breathing heavily? Am I heavy? What? I feel that I'm carrying my living room couch and getting to the 7th floor This is strange, although I visited the nutritionist for a month It seems that you visit Chef Sherbiny not a nutritionist Who is this stupid doctor who gave you this diet? If he feeds you Mosakaa in the morning, you wouldn't reach this weight Shut up! You are dead! - Ok - Shut up! What is this? Are you going to put me in the trunk? Where should I put you? In the dashboard? The serial killers do that. Die! No, don't kill me please I beg you! - No, this isn't right for you - What do you want from me? Please don't kill me No! No! No! No! God punish you! Spray a little are you spraying a garden? Shut up! I'm a coroner and I know what I'm doing very well. Go on Where is her head? What should I do now? Get the heart out of it - Here? - Yes What is this? What did you add to it instead of blood? - Strawberry syrup - Really? Are we in a wedding? Throw the heart Start the next stage of our plan No, this is too much. Who are you? Since when are you standing here? Who are you? I'm astonished Really?

Were you born like that? what about your face? Were you born like that? Can anyone get born like that? As I told you I grew and found myself in a poor orphanage We were 95 kids with one nanny We washed our clothes once weekly The nanny used to gather all our undershirts, socks and underwear when we were young You'll find who vomited Those are the things which leads your to vomit Should I complete or you'll vomit? No, continue, please In a rainy night we played Bartous game as friends I thought of a place to hide in I hid above the storage The pot was under it which had our underwear the Wabour was on under it The Botas's smell spread everywhere I felt dizzy in the storage I didn't manage my balance I fell in the pot with the Botas and the boiling water then when I got out, I found my face so ugly as you see it It is a misery My misery is just like The Hunchback of Notre-Dame Please, don't torture yourself Let's forget our bad memories Let me remind you with a very great moment The first meeting between Ezmeralda and Gozmetho - Goz Medo? - Gozmetho, can't you remember him? I know Medo, the soccer player but Gozmetho is a weird name He his the father of Ezmeralda who refused to marry her to the Hunchback He is the most hateful character I hate it and despise it in the novel You know, I'm so happy to meet you Look! What is this hairy leg? Are you a pig infront of me? It is the gorilla disease It hits 1 every 5 million Did you see how similar are we? No, we're not. I'm a murderer and a serial killer I open the chests of my victims and eat their hearts I saw this extreme and mature act I saw your lust It is the least thing that could help me take my revenge from all females They don't deserve anything but murder Did you kill before? Why are you asking me this question? Take care, don't let him suspect you I'm asking it because you said that I'm your master and you kissed my hand but I'm a killer, how will I be your master? Will it be in aqua ballet for instance? I'll tell you, but not now. Later Good bye - Will I see you again? - We'll meet soon - When? - Don't ask but it will be soon Very soon. Thanks I do all that to myself and no one exerted an effort to follow him to know his place? I didn't manage to sleep because of my anger He is a very clever man If he noticed that anyone of us is following him after leaving you we would have lost all what we built Especially that I noticed that he suspects you I can't believe it. The serial killer is in our hands - and he's lost that way? - We didn't lose anything There is only one thing which we miss We need his confession .He is so careful How will we take it from him, professor? The careful man in order to trust you - will watch you out - Me? He'll watch Ahmed Notre-Dame Is it different?

What will we do if fate played it's game - and he discovered everything? - What is it, Ahmed? Don't be stubborn This exclusive report if you did it - it will benefit you a lot - I know. To the graves directly - Search for another one - Don't exaggerate, son Listen to me, Doctor If you don't see that it is dangerous I say, we should turn El Kharbotly to be Notre-Dame so we could be relatives I won't continue, guys Ahmed? Ahmed, I want to tell you one thing Either you continued or not, what you did made me respect you so much How come? Do you remember when I asked you why you didn't marry what was your reply?
