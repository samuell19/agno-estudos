car what do you think you've unleashed my curiosity why don't you tell me about lizzy the lover from the moment you get inside of her you turn her on she succumbs to you gently trembling to touch and then when you shift her into gear the clutch pedal sliding in and out of her she moves steadily purring with a soft growl happy to be under your control at that point she invokes you she entices you to take her to a speed level of euphoric freedom and then she essentially caresses the road and sways you passionately the heat of her body and the cool of the breeze engulf you you become one with

i would like to answer that question welcome back coleman you may want to pay attention i think you could learn a lot from someone like romeo you may answer the question alexa romeo's passion is for juliet and not roslyn the girl he thought he was in love with although romeo crashed the capulets party to get to roseland as soon as he saw juliet he fell madly in love with her coming to the realization that he'd never really been in love before or seen true beauty until he laid eyes on julia very good miss dumont you might want to share your notes with coleman i think you'll have better luck keeping his attention than i do your homework is to read for your bromine juliet to discuss in tomorrow's class feel like going over today's lesson now i'd like to but i gotta go meet a friend oh your girlfriend no i don't have a girlfriend good i mean maybe some other time then yeah some other time aren't you going to ask me for my number yeah okay sure it's my cell phone there dude never

too bad at least if you're protestant out of a reason to hate you oh you really don't like me too much do you matter this is not about you or me this is about mary and her future why what about her future you can't be part of it for mary's sake it makes you think i have any plans to be a part of it it's not your plans i'm worried about it's hers and what are our plans not to return to ireland with me so that she can be with you well i didn't ask her to stay you didn't ask her not to look matchy's infatuated with you and she thinks it's love she's a grown woman irene she's all that i've got and i didn't raise her up to throw her life away emma likes you so um tell me then what are uh what are the likes of me a man who's self-centered and selfish you hardly know me i mean how can you i know enough enough to know the kind of man that you are you see i married one mary's father and that gives you the right to judge me no but the love i have for my daughter does and i'll be damned if i let her make the same mistake i did but matt erie's not for you she doesn't belong in your world she has a life in ireland good position friends and a young well-to-do fellow that loves her and wants to marry her i mean what can you offer her matt what i'm ready well i can see you've been talking about me yeah you're your mother was telling me you have a boyfriend back home oh which reminds me

the rain [Music] he'd reach for the raindrops that fell through the air [Music] everyone [Music] would is then one day he climbed so hard to touch the sky and he carried him away [Music] i don't know where am i or where i'm bound but it don't matter cause you're not around [Music] every dream i've ever had faded too soon now i'm lost south of the moon [Music] everywhere i go i feel so out of place everywhere i turn i see your face when you appear in the silent darkness of my room just like a shadow south of the moon [Music] sometimes i feel as if i really had enough [Music] i wanna break down and cry instead of acting tough i'm hanging on by a thread feeling so emotionally dead or brokenhearted and sad i miss you so it's just driving me mad i don't know if i'm right or if i'm wrong all i know is i don't belong every song i ever wrote sounds out of tone lost in a dream southern [Music] i'm all alone south of the moon [Music] you
