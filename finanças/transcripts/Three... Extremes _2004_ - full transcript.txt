Mrs. Li? You're so beautiful. They say your dumplings are the most expensive. Of course! Please come in. You've come at the right time! The water is just boiling, waiting for you. Actually, I know who you are. I watched you on TV very often when I first came to Hong Kong. You were the best! I quit acting a long time ago. Please, have a seat. Mrs. Li, guess how old I am. I suppose... you're in your thirties at most. I'm much older than that. Everyone calls me Aunt Mei. But you don't have any wrinkles. And I have fair skin, too. I'm my own best advertisement. Your skin is great. I'm impressed. My dumplings are worth it. You get what you pay for. Mrs. Li... Want me to put in more cabbage? It's up to you. The Northerners always say, "Good feeling comes from a nap. Good taste comes from a dumpling." Dumplings have existed in China for more than 1400 years. But the Southerners still say they're just dough stuffed with meat, nothing special! I use high-gluten flour for texture and chewiness. I knead it fine until it's like a peeled egg. Smooth, translucent and soft. That's the secret to keep the filling from leaking out. So that the juicy flavor explodes in the mouth, eat while it's warm. I eat these often. Sometimes in soup, sometimes minced and steamed with citrus peel. Just think of the results, not what it was. For women to rejuvenate, you must start from inside for the best result. Only my secret formula can do this. Let me sing for you. Well, it's kind of a custom of mine. I often sing songs from my youth when my customers eat. Take it as entertainment. Listen. The water of Hung Lake is rough. My home is on the shore. At dawn, boats go out with nets. At dusk, they return loaded with fish. Wild ducks and lotus roots are here. Autumns are bountiful with rice. They say heaven is beautiful. How can it compare with Hung Lake. You were already on a trip last week. You promised to stay for our 15th anniversary. I'm just going for a few days. I'll try to come back early. It's boring here in the hotel. We'll move into our new home as soon as the renovation is over. See if there's anything else we need in the new house. So many zeroes? You used to laugh a lot. Now even a big fat check can't make you happy? You're not taking me along. Why should I be happy? I'll be gone for only four or five days. And if not? I'll write you another check as a fine. Fines are for mistakes. Whatever. About that contract... If you don't send it over soon, I'm going to change my mind. I went through so much to get these. They're stepping up the surveillance. Because some paparazzi have come. Hong Kong media is so nosy. Just don't show up in the next two weeks. Even the locals can't get hold of the stock now. We'll see. - Thanks. - This is for you. This way, miss. This way, miss. Put it through - Over there? The lunchbox - Okay. Mrs. Li. Ever consider having children? We just can't. I don't know if it's his problem or mine. Don't worry! You'll soon regain your youth, as well as the heart of your man. Do you have more potent stuff for faster results? The best are those in the fifth or sixth month. You have to remove it only by breaking the water sac, then sliding it out. It's covered by a layer of creamy fat. The colors are defined. You can even see the cranium. Its tiny limbs will still be moving around. It's only this big in the first trimester. But the meat will be tough by the third trimester. The fifth-month ones are perfect, kitten-like. So cute and so nutritious. Let me show you. I'm serving it pan-fried this time. We can always try some other styles next time. What's this crunchiness about? It's okay. They have hands and feet already, you know, and ears, too! Those were bones? Nah... their bones are hardly hard. I'll just chop finer next time. Simmer in broth next time. It'll taste less greasy. Broth is good. It keeps all the juices. Are you done? - This can't go on. - Pardon? My skin is still flabby. No! It's much better! I need your most potent stuff. Trust me, I'll find it. It's time for me to sing. - Suit yourself, but I must go. - Bye, Mrs. Li. This way! Don't worry, I'll find it for you. Call me when you do. Trust me. Aunt Mei? - You are...? - I'm a friend of Mrs. Kam. Oh, come on in! Hello, dear. From now on, you don't have to work anymore. And live off you? I can afford that, given you're so slim and eat so little. - Not true. I love eating. - And you like to laugh, too. Relax. You're almost there. It's been 18 hours already. Relax. You must try to relax, dear. Will she be all right? Of course. Try to relax. Your cervix has not fully dilated yet. Poor girl, you're not even fully grown. We women must defend ourselves. Don't let others bully you again. The water broke! - It's okay. - Don't be nervous. I swear it will be over in seconds. Breathe deeply! Work with me, okay? Relax. Hold on... Relax... Cry if you want to. It's fully dilated! Stay calm! And on my count... One, two, three! Where are my tongs? Relax! Try to relax. Beautiful. Don't be sad, my dear. There's no more life in this baby. Want some snacks? I'll do steamed dumplings this time. Need some wine, too. It was a boy. A boy? See that little thing? So beautiful and rare. Boys don't get aborted in China. I didn't use any oxytocin, just a catheter. Drugs make it inedible. It'll damage your nervous system. It's a first-born, the most nutritious. Nothing in the world can beat this nutrition. The mother's a schoolgirl... young and healthy. Then get working! What's the style today? This will make you feel like new, I promise. Hello? My husband broke his leg. Now you need me. Normally you wouldn't even care where I go. You smell nice... look nice. You haven't held me in ages. Thirsty? I'll get water. It's so hot in the street. And we must go to Mongkok next. Darn! I forgot about that. Two more trunks to move. - Woe is me. - Big trunks, too. What the hell? - What's this? - What is it? - It's blood. - My goodness! Here's a tissue. Whose blood is this? Kate? Are you all right? Kate, what's going on? Answer me, Kate! Answer me! Kate? You all right? What's going on? Something is going on here. - She must have taken something. - Definitely. Mrs. Li. You look fabulous! Absolutely radiant! - Talking behind my back? - No! Just praising you. I'll catch up later. You're so late. Perhaps she found herself a guru, or better, voodoo. That's scary! Mrs. Li, stop busying yourself. Join us. - Bon appetite. - Thanks. The food smells kind of fishy. Yes. - Is it the beef? - The beef? It's the fish, I think. Really? I don't think so. There's a strange smell here. Something wrong with the food? God, the smell is horrible. I've forgot to check something. Excuse me. She's off again! Why is she so tense? Aunt Mei? What was this "best stuff'?" What did you feed me? The fetus was sick, wasn't it? Or poisonous? This baby was hard to find. Available only because his father was also his grandfather. One in a million, you know. A child of incest? A cursed child turns me into this? A cursed child has extra potency, I tell you. Hey! Mrs. Li, Hurry! Turn on the TV. Channel 2 is rerunning your series! Heard you have a crush on someone from the neighborhood boys school. No... - You sure? - No... The one you said looks like Alan Tam. I never said so! Mrs. Li, you crying? Don't be sad. Be strong. Good night, Mrs. Li. Headaches? And rashes? It's just nerves. You should be happy instead. You're two months pregnant! We've confirmed it. - You sure? - Definitely. Peter, you told me I couldn't conceive! Not anymore! Now you can! - You sure there's no mistake? - Not a chance. This is the best news for both Mr. Li and you! I'll prescribe you something to ease your tension. You'll be fine in a couple of days. - Nurse. - Yes, Dr. Wong? Mrs. Li's chauffeur will come pick up her medication. How many days' prescription? - Give her a week's worth. - Okay. Don't move! Dispatch, we've arrived at 2103. Victim is male, badly cut. We need an ambulance. We have his wife under control. Tell them to hurry. The victim is still alive! So much stuff left. What are these... so well-hidden? Hello? Just a minute. There, all right. No, I'm not busy. I was just having dinner. Have you eaten? I can't finish it. Yeah, I've left it frozen. My stomach doesn't feel so good. Anyway... it's been months since I moved here. Aren't you going to come over? How about tomorrow? We can have breakfast together... if you don't mind cold leftovers. You really want to hear me play? My stomach is really bothering me! I feel nauseous! Perhaps the food is past its expiration date. Darling, it's killing me! And... cut. 20... What's scene 29 again? - Good-bye, sir. - Good-bye. Scene 29 is where Young-Chae draws blood with a water pump. - Right. - If we push it back to the 13th, shoot the inserts for scene 8 and 9 during the morning of the eighth, and I'll finish editing before the night shoot. Then the crew can catch some sleep in between. But you won't get any sleep at all. Better just one, than all 60 of the crew losing sleep. Quite true. - Take care, sir. - Yeah, you too. Kyung-ah, get the guys to do the heavy work! I heard you're going to Seoul. Could you drop me off at Hanam City? Sure. - Good-bye, sir. - Good-bye. Sir... the daggers we talked about. Good work. Good work, everyone! I ran over from Studio 3 as soon as I heard you were here. Did you read the scripts I sent you? What do you think? Which one should I do? "Pink Panty." Go for "Pink Panty." They say Director Jang is the John Waters of Korea. Still... don't you think his film is a little sinister? - Kim Chang's film seems better. - Director Kim Chang... His film only makes the director look good. The actors don't get noticed at all. Just don't waste your time on him. What about this? Trying something other than Mr. Nice Guy? Like a psycho-rapist-killer thing... huh? Huh? Don't worry, I ate already. Just go back to your work. We can have breakfast together tomorrow. I'll take care of it if you don't mind cold leftovers. You should have come to see the set! It looks just like our house. Hey, I got the music for the film! Listen to this. THE REHEARSAL WILL END LATE! DON'T FORGET YOUR VEGGIE DIET! You've got... such pretty hands, ma'am. There's jewelry in the bedroom. Take it all. Just don't hurt anyone. Please, let us go! Darn. You're not supposed to start off with this kind of talk! You shouldn't have started begging... until like 20 minutes later. Wait till things fall apart first! You are, after all, the head of the house. If you're only capable of begging from the onset, who else could your wife count on? Remember what happened when you shot the "Uninvited Guest" in 1998? When those gangsters busted in on the shoot... "Stop it!" You shouted at them boldly! What's happened to your guts now? Who are you? Who, me? Maybe you'll recognize me like this. Nope? Red Hunt! Huh? Water! Water! Water... What the hell? Ready, huh? Action, huh? And... cut! She's a pianist... I know that of course! I've done my research. It's got to be the pianist's fingers for the cut to mean something. Only an idiot would want her toes instead! Honey! Honey, I'll... take care of this somehow. Honey, are you all right? It hurts a lot, doesn't it? I still don't know what's going on... But I'm sure we can get out of this somehow. Just trust me, okay? Does it hurt a lot, honey? Try and bear it a little longer! Do that for me, okay? It will all be over soon. I'll... I'll make sure you can play again. I love you, honey. Let's be strong. One way or another, I'll... - I remember you now! - Yeah? An extra. I was in all five of your films, sir. You were such a kind man, unlike any other directors I've ever worked with. So kind, no matter what mistakes I made. Remember the mob scene in "The Desert"? You were shooting the crowd running in the distance. Some moron knocked over a hornet's nest as we ran. I got stung, I freaked out and I ruined the take. Naturally... the damn assistant director gave me hell. But then you said... How about using the time to set up another take instead of yelling? It's not like he wanted to get stung. Is your neck okay? You were so sweet. But what's the use of that? You don't even recognize me. Why are you doing this to me? What do you mean, "Why"? Because this world is so fucked up! That's why! Look at this, look! I didn't even know there were houses like this in Korea! Lots of people are better off than us. This house is merely... All the rich people I've ever met... they're all scumbags, no respect for people. I don't even consider them human beings. But you, you are a good man. That's so fucking unfair! You're rich, handsome, educated in America, a genius director, and you have a pretty wife. If you're also a good man on top of that, what are guys like me supposed to get? You know, on TV shows, only the poor folks are good people. Never the rich! You've already got everything. Why do you have to corner us too? Why are you a good man too? You live well in this world and you'll live well in heaven. Our lives suck and we're going to hell. This is totally outrageous. That's not true. "It's harder for a rich man to get into heaven than a camel to go through the eye of a needle." - It's in the Bible! - Bullshit. It's easier for a rich man to get into heaven than putting a needle into a camel's nostril! Face it, you've got no cause to sin. Of course I have. Then prove it! What persistence. I'm sorry for being a good person. Look at that! Look! What a good man! I can let your wife go. On one condition. You have to kill someone right here! Can you do that? I'll do as you wish. Let her go and I'll die in her place. You don't need to die. You just need to strangle the little kid over there. If you don't, every five minutes I'll cut off another one of your wife's fingers. Let's see how good you can stay. Ready. - Go! - Who is this kid? I don't know her either! Met her on my way here! She looked bored so I brought her along. Guess what. I've been dirt poor ever since I was a kid. My bastard father was always dead drunk. He beat the hell out of us day in and day out. Needless to say, my grades were bad. And this ugly face of mine could get me nowhere near stardom. So you see, now I'm the one who always gets drunk. I go home and I kick my boy's ass. And I beat my wife too. When I sober up in the morning and see that swollen, beat-up face of hers, guess what I think of? Your face! Your nice handsome face overlapping hers. It makes perfect sense. A poor kid grows up to be a bastard and a rich kid grows up to be a good man! That's fate! Damn it! Hell, no! No... Time flies. What should I do, honey? Whatever you say. Should I kill her? Don't kill her? What a decisive man! My goodness! What a decisive man! Listen to me. Life has many stages. I went through many difficulties before getting this far. It wasn't as easy as you think. I didn't get it for free. Someone once said, "No time to blink, keep striving for..." Fuck that! I'm not stupid! It's a line from your own film! Jin says that to Rose in "Last Wish." Want me to follow suit? Remember the cabaret scene in "Dancing Factory"? You wrote the song lyrics as well. I did some dancing there too. I'm not going to listen to your words anymore. All are a pack of lies! All out of hypocrisy! We'll make our own words. We'll make our own truth. I'm not going to listen to your words anymore I'm sorry, little one. I really can't hold out. I'm sorry! I'm not a good man. You don't even know me! How can you prove that I'm a good man? The truth is... whenever an actor asks for my advice, I always persuade them not to work with Director Kim Chang. Because... he's my sole rival. I can't stand that jerk having any good actors in his films. You call that shit a confession? Do I look like an idiot to you? I've never said that you were a saint. Who the hell hasn't done a thing as trivial as that? Give me a break. Let me show you what a confession really is. For example... before I left home this morning, I killed my wife. I must have strangled her for more than 30 minutes. Her tongue hung out all the way and she shit everywhere. I was going to finish my son too, but it was not that easy. I just couldn't do that. Now, that's what I call a confession! Your turn. Give me something nice and juicy. Wait! I'll talk! I'll talk! There's a wardrobe girl called Kyung-Ah. I offered to give her a ride home one day. I lied that her home was on my way. And then I drove her to a motel. We've been doing this for three years already since "The Bluebird." Love isn't a sin. We dropped by a motel tonight too. Lakeside Motel, room 304. We did it twice in three hours. No... three times in two hours. I'm really sorry, honey. I shouldn't have told you this when you're already suffering so much. It hurts a lot, doesn't it? But then... you shouldn't mind this. You've never had any real pains in your life, and no worries either. Know why I like Kyung-Ah? Unlike you, she's smart, and we can talk about many things. As for you, I'd rather you not to talk to me at all. All you care to talk about are clothes and plastic surgery! When I make love to you, I'm not sure whether I'm holding a woman or a bag of silicon. Guess how old my wife is. 33. Just one year younger than me but already a Botox junkie. Now her expression doesn't change even if she smiles. What she has is not a face but a mask. And that mask yelps at me every day, "I love you, honey!" Mi-ran, be honest for just this once in your life. Do you know what love is? Don't pity yourself for losing your fingers. They don't deserve any tears. Because you can't play for shit. Plus, you don't cook and you never clean. You hands have no use anyway other than for wearing jewelry. Listen. Know what an artist without talent is? Nada. Not existing. A nothing. Like a ring without a hole or a square ball! Get it? If you can't play, it'll be nice and quiet here. Also... it'll be so much lighter for you to wave "Bye-bye"! No, no, no, not yet. There's something else I've been trying to say. I've been holding it back for a whole 10 years now. Curious? Screw you, bitch! Truth is, she has an affair too. Know the tenor she plays accompaniment for? He's her lover. Do you know? I saw it all when I was following her around. Am I wrong? Speak up for yourself. Oh, I forgot you're gagged. But you can nod, can't you? Do what you should do! Ah... You already knew! Didn't you? Didn't you? How about this? I'm kind of depressed. So if you really want to buy some time, you can try to make me laugh. Every time you succeed, I'll extend the deadline another five minutes. You've made good comedies. Now you can try your hand at acting in one. Okay? - Ready and... - You son of a bitch! You... you've never seen me losing my temper, right? I'm going to show it to you now. You son of a bitch. Your dad was a moron and he made you a loser. Is that my fault? Did I rob your bank? Did I steal your wife? What do I have to do with your unhappy existence? Shame on you, you moron. Why don't you just kill yourself? Your life is a waste of time anyway. Want me to make you laugh? Do you know who you're talking to? I'm Ryu Ji-ho, the Ryu Ji-ho! You're merely a lowlife extra! You want me to make you what? Get the hell out of here. Just untie me and go home! Go fix your son some instant noodles, okay? You've freaked me out and corrupted me. Your mission has been completed. I'll never mention what happened today. If you want her fingers that much, cut them all off! Or better, just cut off her hands! Why bother cutting off her fingers one by one? Just finish it quickly and get the hell out of here. I want nothing more. No, wait! My closing statement. You've never gone for cheap laughs like this in your comedies. You're so disappointing. Wait, wait! I was too wound up. I made mistakes. I swear I didn't mean to do so. Wait! Wait! What are you doing now? What are you doing? Wait, wait, wait. Give me one more chance. Just give me one more try. Please! I beg you! My pose was bad, and I couldn't help making that kind of mistake. Don't be so inflexible! Just one more chance. Damn it. I shouldn't have given you any false hope. Nowadays, if you get to the hospital within 10 hours, they can reattach the fingers neatly. No! Wait! I'll do it! I'll kill her! Look, I'm doing it now! You bastard! I said I was going to do it! Why didn't you wait? You saw it too, right? You know I have no choice. Honey, I'm going to do it, okay? That was three, right? Three, so, seven... You'll keep your seven, honey! I'm doing this not because I hate you, okay? You think I'm doing this because I hate your wife? "Hate" is nobody's fault. For example, who do you think she hates more right now? Me or you? Let's hear it! Kill her! Kill her! What are you waiting for, you idiot? Kill her! I'm telling you! Kill her! You see? Easy, miss. You'll probably have one finger left on each hand. He's got to give in by then. You can still become a percussionist. No law against playing drums with "Chopsticks." Common folks like me prefer drum beats to music. You're right, better to just cut off her whole hand. Damn time flies. 47 seconds... 46 seconds... - No! - 45 seconds... 44 seconds, 43 seconds. 42 seconds, 41 seconds. 40 seconds, 39 seconds. 38 seconds, 37 seconds. 36 seconds, 35 seconds. 34 seconds, 33 seconds. 32 seconds, 31 seconds. 30 seconds, 29 seconds. 25 seconds... 22 seconds... 20 seconds... 19 seconds, 18 seconds. 17 seconds, 16 seconds. 15 seconds, 14 seconds. 13 seconds, 12 seconds. 11 seconds, 10 seconds. 9 seconds. 8 seconds. - No! - 7 seconds! 6 seconds! 5 seconds! 4 seconds! 3 seconds! Mr. Director... How about this? For example... You scumbags... I'll take revenge. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It can't be helped. I tried my best! You saw it all! Yes, you did! I have to do this for my wife, you know. I really love her. It's hard for a kid like you to understand. The world is filled with things you can't get away from. No matter how hard you struggle... there are things you're being forced to do. Dear... All right, honey! Just wait a bit! I'll take care of it! I'm sorry. Really sorry. - I'm sorry... - Ple... Please! Don't rush me! Can't you see I'm trying? It'll be over soon! I'm sorry I shouted, honey. You know I love you! I don't believe you have another man. I don't care even if it's true. I'm going to forget it all. After all, I'm the head of the house. I must forget everything that happened today. I'll just think of it as a dream. I love you, honey! I'm so sorry, kid. I'm truly sorry. Please forgive me. I love you, Mi-ran. Please forgive me, this grown-up... this old man. Forgive me. You have to forgive me. Honey, I love you. Forgive me. I'm sorry. Sorry. Forgive me. The dream... always... ends there. You still don't trust me, do you? The box is too small. I can't breathe. I finished it. Thank you very much. I'll go to the office and read it over. Your handwriting is almost as neat as typing. I don't mean it should be typed, either. I don't have a choice. I can't type. You're left-handed, aren't you? I've read so many manuscripts. I can tell whether it's left or right. I'll be in touch then. One thing... I mean... Your novels are doing very well. Here, a small token. Sis'? Sister, dear? It's you, isn't it? It's me. Kyoko. Say something. Sister! It's hot... I'm burning... It wasn't what you think! It really wasn't! It wasn't! Shoko... You... did well today. A little reward. Keep up the good work. Kyoko, keep trying! You'll be rewarded too. Sensei. I was looking... looking for someone. Someone? Who is it? Can't I be him? At least... I'm here for you. You do look like him. Bear it for one night. I want to be you... to sleep like you... to have nice dreams. What's going on? Shoko, don't worry. Shoko! Sister... I'm sorry. I didn't do it out of hatred. It wasn't the necklace, either. I loved you so much, sis'. I looked for you everywhere. It's true. I loved you more than anyone in the world. More than anyone. Help me... So beautiful. 10-year-old Shoko and... 25-year-old Kyoko. Which one of you is more beautiful? Oh, Kyoko... - Why did you do it? - Don't... You thought I only loved your sister? Poor thing... The heat was unbearable. Don't! She couldn't get out. She's trapped. Don't! In that tiny box! No, no! Look. Look! If you hadn't done it, she'd be here now! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I saved one for you too. What? Can't have one without the other! Shoko and Kyoko... Together, a perfect pair. You're one and the same to me! The dream... always... ends just there. Good morning. Good morning. In reality... we've been together... since birth. I had a weird dream. Me too. But then... our dreams... differ slightly. Subtitled By JR Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA
