(sewing machine sounds) (music) - My name's Matt, I'm a Brand Manager at a backpacking company. In my job I interact with a lot of customers. And I find out about a lot of interesting and unique trails all across the world. The Uinta Highline Trail really stood out because it seemed to be such a uncommon trail. - It's really remote, it's really high. Most of the trail's above 10,000 feet. I think it's just kind of a hidden gem. - Just from the little research that I did. And the pictures that I saw, I knew that this hike was gonna be something spectacular. - I didn't know really a whole lot about Utah to be honest with you. I wasn't expecting very much. - I expect to be uncomfortable and in pain. - Logistically when you try to get a lot of people in one spot at the same time, usually something goes wrong. And this time Steve's journey really became a comedy of errors. - Matt, Will and myself we flew on one plane and then Benny had come in a day earlier and Steve was coming from Raleigh, North Carolina and his flight didn't make it. He was late, he missed his connection in Denver. He stuck there, he had to change airlines. Thank goodness he did arrive there a few hours late, but we were worried. We didn't know if he was gonna be able to even come with us on the hike or not. So it was great that he he got there. It wouldn't have been the same without Steve. - These guys, I don't know why I like them, I really don't. So I'm gonna be late going into Salt Lake City. I have no time to go to a store to buy food. And I'm asking them to buy food for me and they're like, no, I don't have room. I don't have time, I can't do it. You're gonna have to starve to death on the site. Well, finally, Will Wood My Savior, went out and bought me a bunch of food and I had plenty to eat on the trail. - Fortunately, our shuttle driver was so gracious. He was able to just wait on Steve and that made that a less stressful event. - So basically I'm a Star Wars nerd, especially with the original trilogy. So you've got, Boba Fett, Mandalorian, Imperial Destroyer, Slave I, TIE Fighter. So I have like, a lot of Star Wars stuff. And because of those tattoos, we could never get a ride hitch hiking into town, we had to walk the whole way. (upbeat music) - From Salt Lake City, it was about a four to five hour drive. It was so cool because you instantly just start to ascend into the mountains. And then you go around the mountain range. So we went through the desert. And all we were doing there was climbing, just to see the way the landscape looked as we were approaching the trail, it was unexpected. By the time we arrived at the trailhead, we were already right around 8000 feet or so in elevation. We knew at that point just seeing what it looked like, we were in for an incredible hike. - The mountains and the forests looked beautiful. And we all just camped right there. We're really just amped to be starting this journey together. - Well look at that spot right there, nice and flat. I think I'm gonna put my tent right there. - Right by the road? - Right by the road. - Are crazy? - That when the car is coming, you can wonder if it's gonna run you over or not. (laughing) It'll add that little bit of excitement to your night. - Matt you found something good back there? - Yeah, but it's, he's gonna say it's good. He doesn't wanna walk back so... What he says has no relevance to what's actually up there. That's what we've learned on past hikes. - Okay, I'm gonna go see what I can find. (upbeat music) - I feel the elevation. Just from setting this up, I can feel it a little bit it's a little harder to breathe. - Actually I see a trail looks like a wildlife trail that goes between our sites and some spots where elk have been doing their business, there's a chance that they'll come up through our camp tonight and that'd be cool. - Can't wait to see some moose. - Lets change that...You hear that? - What is that? - Matt said it was an elk. - What time do you think sun rise is? - Let's say, somewhere between 5:00am and 6:30am would be a guess. But either way, I mean, if thunderstorms are always gonna be a threat in the afternoon getting an early start is not a bad idea. - If we get going at like six in the morning we're gonna be done at 12 or one o'clock. - Well if we get started at 10am, and then we hike through a hailstorm every day at 2:00pm that would also not be fun. - Nothing wrong with that. - I don't think there's gunna be hailstorms - A $20 bet that we have two or more hailstorms. - Does it actually have to hail or... - It actually has to hail, like a substantial amount. - I will take that bet. It's gotta be ice falling from the sky. I mean twice on the same day doesn't count right? - I'm gunna lose this bet but.... - I wanna just bet you some thing. (soft music) - Well, for me my expectations for this hike was a little bit different. I started my summer out hiking the long trail that goes through the Green Mountains of Vermont. Once I finished that one, I went over to California through hiked John Muir Trail. So I thought this wasn't gonna be like anything magnificent is just 100 miles long. Don't ever underestimate a trail. - So today we're gonna hike about 12 miles. We're gonna be in a forest most of the time, so that's good. The thing that's not so good is there's not really much water. We may have some water at the end, so hopefully we don't get dehydrated. We're gonna start climbing slow and then in two more days, we should get above treeline and be above 10,000 feet almost the whole time. - My name is Tom Flanigan, I'm the Forest Archeologist and the Heritage Program Manager for the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. The Uinta Highline Trail traversals about 104 miles along the backbone of the Uinta Mountains. The eastern terminus is in McKee Draw which is located on the Ashley National Forest. The western terminus is over by Hayden peak, Hayden Pass area near the Mirror Lake highway. The Uintas were designated as a primitive area long before the Wilderness Act. So this was identified early on as a unique place. We have a unique topography, we have a mountain range that's unique in its linear structure going east to west, the geology, the history and its importance to the expansion of the West. Even in 1935, it was identified as unique enough to be set aside as a primitive area. - The trail itself seems to be built in sections. We've done our own research here. And it was kind of interesting, the fact that a lot of the Forest Service folks don't have a whole lot of idea when the trail was actually built. Doing some of the historic research we're able to put together some of the different aspects of it. And probably the earliest, identifiable concerted effort to make a trail was during the Civilian Conservation Corps era under the new deal and the Roosevelt administration trying to put everybody back to work. A lot of our infrastructure on the national parks, national forests were created by the CCC. And I did find a newspaper article dating to the 1930s talking about some of the early sections of the trail from that Hayden Peak Hayden pass area being constructed by Boy Scout troops and also members of the CCC. So then probably what happened is then the trail was building in sections from that, and then also maybe existing trails had then got tied into it. (birds chirping) - Hi you guys! - Moooooooo - Uh Oh..... - Not the wildlife I thought I was gunna see out here - Day one, we were constantly in and out of meadows and forests and the trail was tough to navigate. In fact, for a huge portion there was actually no trail, you were really just following a route. - So the trail was marked with rock Cairns and blazes like ax places on the trees and a lot of it didn't really have foot tread, or if there was foot tread it was very light. And I think we got turned around a couple times that first day. We had a nice argument over which was the right trail because there was an old trail and a new trail that split off. - This isn't showing any turns. There's a road that we're supposed to cross and we haven't crossed it yet. And there's no junctions on here. - All I did was get a file, you guys made me the navigator I didn't ask to be the navigator. - Yeah, but you didn't check your file. - See up here, the blaze is old, but on this same trail going down before you get to the...it's brand new. - Yeah, let's stick on the new trail. - What do you mean a new trail? - No, I'm saying this trail has a brand new blaze at the bottom. - Yeah, because it's going that way. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I don't wanna get lost. - My name is Joe Valesko. I started a company that makes ultralight backpacking gear in 2005. Since then, I've hiked probably over 10,000 long distance miles. - Joe's one of the most interesting people I've ever met. He's one part like robot in a way. At work, he's just an engineer. He's kind of emotionless, he just wants to do things a certain way. - Problem there is on the other tent on the prototype tent, this piece shouldn't be this long. It's supposed to be like this long. - And then on the other hand, you've got this guy who in Scotland on top of the second highest mountain in Scotland, it's like 60 mile per hour sustained winds, we can barely walk. And we're like getting blown all over the place. And I look up and the guy's got the biggest smile on his face. So he's like, one part engineer, and then one part living on the edge, and it's almost like he's two people. - Woooo!!! It is straight down. - Joe has the most minimal needs of anyone I've ever met. - So I always hike in sandals, they keep my feet cool. They dry off really quick. - There's not really any downside to it, really. I mean, I did the Continental Divide Trail in sandals in the snow and everything else, I just had waterproof socks. - He can get by on very little external material things. He's truly a minimalist, and he's happy being so. - Joe's kind of quiet, doesn't say a whole lot. - He's very opinionated, he's very determined, and he's mentally strong. He's got more experience backpacking than any of us. He's hiked the Appalachian Trail, the Continental Divide Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail. Those are just the three long trails he's done in the United States. Then the Te Araroa in New Zealand. His wife did a lot of the hikes with him but she did the Te Araroa, pregnant. If that says anything. - He's always been very confident. He's very smart, he loves the outdoors. I think of him, I think of the color green. - I was outdoors a lot as a kid. We had a kind of a forest behind my house and I spent a lot of time back there. We had a river, I used to go swimming a lot. My family used to go on camping trips. Whenever we went on vacation, we were usually low budget so we would go camping. When I was in high school, I got the idea that I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail. So I started researching backpacking, I'd never been backpacking before, I realized that lightweight gear was important. So I bought the lightest gear I could find, did some test hikes, looked at it and realized a lot of it was just way too heavy and unnecessary. So I got into making my own gear and ultimately ended up hiking the Appalachian Trail in 2004 with mostly homemade gear. Nobody was ultralight back then, everybody was carrying like 40, 50 pounds, big heavy backpacks, it was awful. So I was carrying, you know, an eight pound backpack and everybody's like, what are you doing, you're gonna die or they were all impressed or scared for my life, one of the other. The people that liked the idea, they're like you should start making this stuff when you get off the trail and I had just graduated college and didn't have a job yet or anything. So I finished the AT, went back home to my parents house and of course they were putting a lot of pressure on me to get a job. So I ended up getting a job as a software developer but at the same time I was starting to make my first products to sell and I put together a little website and that's how it all got started. I met my wife in college, I had a studio apartment so I was working out of my kitchen, I would come home from work and start working again. I'd start building a backpack or building stuff sacks or building little stuff like that. - In 2010 we grew pretty fast, it was actually stressful. (motivational music) - I spent the last decade and a half building my business and that was more than a full time job. You know we'd get up in the morning and work until we went to bed at night pretty much, but I've been trying to tone that back or dial that back lately. - We are having more family time which is great. - My family is the most important thing to me. Every day we try and go and do something. We'll go canoeing or camping, outdoor stuff. From what I've seen kids just do the opposite of what their parents do. So I don't really have expectations. I hope they like the outdoors and I hope they like doing the same sorts of stuff that my wife and I like to do. But eventually they're gonna be their own people. I know that. - I think he's a great husband. I think he's a great father. I hope I'm friends with Joe for life. (birds chirping) - I got the sandals, the staff and the hats. So I picked up the trail name, Samurai Joe It'd make more sense if I was wearing the hat. - My tail name is Red Beard and I think you might be able to figure out why I have that trail name. I got it on the AT, my first thru hike. - My trail name is Plug-It-In. Actually, it's the name of my business. I was wearing one of my Plug It In t-shirts. Whenever I was hiking one time and a, through hiker came through and said "Hey what's up, Plug It In?" That's how it happens. - My trail name is Cannonball. I got it on my very first night before I hiked my very first hike. I fell off the top deck of the Fontana Hilton Getting up to go to the bathroom, I got a concussion. And everybody was very concerned. They said, "Are you okay?" I said, no, I'm not okay. But no one seemed to get up to care. The next day, I had a concussion, I couldn't eat. I was dizzy, and I almost threw up. I love it, so I've been hiking ever since, I fell in love with hiking that day. - My trail name is Details. Actually, Steve gave it to me because I was obsessesing over all the logistics of the trip, and now they like to make fun of me when I miss a detail, so... - It's built in name so we can make fun of him when he gets things wrong. And we just make up things that he does wrong just so we could make fun of him. He's a great planner. (upbeat music) - Dang that's good - My name's Gordon Hirschi. I'm president, Uinta Basin Back Country Horsemen. I've been clearing these trails for about 10 years. The Highline Trail is special to me because there's very few people and it has great scenery. The purpose behind Back Country Horseman is we make sure that trail stays open. Basically, we go through with chain saws and other hand tools, and the trees that are fallen or getting ready to fall, that might be a danger to the users, we remove those trees from the trail. We also put in water bars, either made out of rocks or small wooden bars, and they're put in at an angle to divert the water off the trail. If you don't, it'll eventually wash the trail out. In the winter, I'm a couch potato. When it comes time to working on the trails, I actually look forward to it, I bug the forest service I says, get the gates open. I need to get up there and get to work. And then in the health aspect, I usually lose 30 to 40 pounds every summer by just getting out and climbing on and off a horse and the gals sometimes asked what my secret is, so I says, come on out. I'll put you on a horse and give you a chainsaw and I'll show you how to lose pounds. (laughing) Something had to be done or we would lose the trails for posterity. (upbeat music) - Well, we were walking down this meadow here looking for some water and we came across this beautiful little stream it kind of looks like it just comes right out of the ground. - I don't feel great. - You don't? What's the matter? - I'm just hurty everywhere. - Hurty (laughing) He's in the fetal position. - Sorry man. - I just had a great dinner, great hiking day. Can't wait to get in there and go to sleep, watch some TV. Read, write some letters. Wake up in the morning, and do it all over again. (scary music) - One of the biggest things we run onto as trail people is what they call "altitude sickness". - Will, he wasn't feeling too good, he was having some issues with the elevation. - He had a slight headache as did I and he was feeling a little bit nauseous. - You figure they're coming from almost zero all the way up to almost 10,000 feet. - It's not a fun deal. The severe cases you feel disoriented. - Well, today was day one on the Highland, which trail are we on again? - By the time we got to camp, it seemed to be getting a little bit worse. So after he attempted to eat some food, it really got worse. (scary music) - My name is Will Wood and I work for a backpacking company and I run the backpacking company's social media and I also backpack for living. - Will's a fun guy, he's pretty laid back. He's usually pretty happy go lucky. - You're almost doing the backpack dance. (laughing) - He's a strong hiker. - The older I get, the less I can keep up with a guy. - He's got thousands of miles under his belt. He knows what he's doing when he's on the trail. - He hiked the Appalachian Trail and then the year after that he did most of the PCT. - He has a little camera and he films everything. He does gear reviews. - Hey, guys, Red Beard here. Well, I've been getting a lot of requests on trekking poles. - He filmed his hikes. - Wow you can really tell just how much water got dumped in this area. - Apparently a bunch of people like to watch him do that. So he's pretty popular on social media. - He loves the outdoors, he loves the community. He really cherishes his relationship with his followers, and I cherish my relationship with him. - Will Wood is quite a tender soul much more than what you would think just meeting him. He has a lot of depth, a lot of emotion. He cares deeply about people. He's very smart, he has a lot of skills. He is just a close dear friend of mine. - Growing up as a kid, I was really passionate about sports. I played tennis, soccer, cross country track. And I started hiking, when I was young with my dad, he would take us to the Smoky Mountains and my family would kind of hang out in town and my dad and I would go into the forest and just hike all the trails in the Smokies and ever since then I really started to develop a passion for being outside and backpacking. - I hike because I love being in the forest. And I've also found that when I'm traveling, I love experiencing different cultures, whether I'm hiking just in different states in the United States or in other countries. - Well, guys, we've made it to Iceland. - Well, I can't believe I'm here in southern Chile of Patagonia. - Well, here we are in Tasmania. - I really get a grasp for the culture and the people when I'm walking and exploring on foot. So it's just a lot different than driving in a car. You really feel much more connected to the location. (soft music) - Before I started long distance hiking in 2014, I found that I was kind of lost and a lot of times I settled in life, I got married young, before I really even kind of knew who I was as a person. (soft music) - Before I was kind of just playing everything safe. So long distance hiking forced me out there on my own. It really just, it awakened me, it awakened my soul. Since then, my life has just been one adventure after the next really and all it took was that first initial step, once I started chasing after the things that I was passionate about, that's when I just started to notice my life beginning to change. I met Joe and Matt in 2013, as I was preparing for the Appalachian Trail, a good friend of mine who was gonna originally hike the trail with me. He went to the warehouse of the backpacking company where Joe and Matt work at and he introduced himself and they invited us to come on a hike with them in the Smokys. It was about a 70 miles section hike. We started to bond on that hike and form a friendship. After I finished the Appalachian Trail, I ended up moving down to Florida to work with them and we've been close friends ever since. And we've hiked all over the world together the last four or five years it's been quite an adventure. - Will and I met actually on a dating app. - She was different than any girl that I had seen since moving to Florida. Her pictures were of her on a tractor. She's a farmer and she's very passionate about what does, I just was really drawn to that. - When we first met, he popped his head in my window. And was super smiley and I just saw all this red hair and he was just super funny, made me laugh a lot, we got along great, he was also a little nervous. I could tell, but it was really cute. (upbeat music) - Long distance hiking definitely can impact your normal home life. Obviously, if you're gonna be gone for a month to six months hiking through the forest, sometimes you don't even have cell phone service. It can be tough, it can be tough for those you love and those that you leave behind. But for us, it's definitely a little bit more difficult because we are running a small farm. So it does put more work on Joelle. But she's a worker, so she's able to hold things down until I get back and I'm kind of more her helper. She's the professional farmer, so I'm learning from her. - Hiking for Will is his passion and I want him to do what he loves. He's always excited to come home and share with me his experiences and I really love that. (upbeat music) (coughing) (barfing sounds) (Mellow music) - Typically, when I hike at elevation I've walked 1000 miles before I've gotten there so I've had no issues but on this trip after the first day of hiking, we were approaching 10,000 feet in elevation. So last night I experienced for the first time having elevation sickness and it was pretty rough. I attempted to eat dinner and threw it up so I threw up twice, today's a new day. I'm feeling great this morning. So let's keep our fingers crossed. It's gonna be different today. - Will seem to be doing fine and all the effects of the altitude had gone away. - So Benny and I took a little side trip down to Mill Park, which had an old sawmill and we found these old cabins that were like 100 years old or more. It was really cool to see the history of the pioneers, to see the relics. - The remnants maybe just three, four logs high, but still, that was very cool to see that, especially to step in those cabin areas. Knowing that 100 years ago, people lived in those, and people were walking on the very spots that we were walking on. (saw mill sounds) (soft music) - Near the end of the day, we're gonna pass Carter Military Trail and there's a stream there so we can load up, then after that we're gonna be hitting a bunch of water. (upbeat music) - Day two was very similar to day one we did pop out of the forest. - We came next to this one hill and we could see just this one pile of rocks up there and we thought, you know, that looks pretty cool, let's go check it out. It honestly look like a chimney, is was basically a huge rock cairn that someone had built up that was probably eight feet tall, if not taller than that. - We got our first view of the mountains all around. So that was pretty cool. We sat up there on top of this little peak for quite a while and had our lunch and everything. - So you see this hill behind me it doesn't look like it's that tall, right? It's maybe like 40, 50 feet, just climbing up this hill. I felt like I was about to die, I could not breathe. We're at about 10,150 feet or so. There's just not much oxygen up here. But I can say I'm loving it, it's beautiful out here. - Throughout day two, Joe seemed to be coughing and falling behind, which is not typical Joe, he's usually near or at the lead. So we were all kind of concerned to see what was going on there but it didn't seem like too big of a deal 'cause his spirits were still pretty good. - We continue to gradually climb all day as we were approaching the High Uintas. We had a GPS file that we used, it was on our phone and it would have been tough to get through that area without that. - The trail was still mostly non existent We were just following cairns and blazes on the trees. - So it's hailing out a little bit, hoping it doesn't start raining. We found this nice little spot to relax under the pine tree here while we wait, have a little snack. Hopefully it'll just blow by without raining too hard. It's dripping on me, but that's about it right now. (upbeat music) - During the first 20 some odd miles as you're approaching the High Uintas there's really not many opportunities to get water. - We stumbled across some water that may have been questionable. It seemed like there was a lot of cow activity in the area. And the water tasted reminiscent of that activity. - It looked like cows had done nothing but pee and poop in this thing for like years. - It was pretty disgusting. - It was kind of gross and kind of yellowish brown color. - You know cow poop water is not your first choice, I don't think. - There really wasn't any water that day on trail, other than that, so we just did our best to filter and scoop from there. I don't think I filtered it but I did, I did boil it and cook with that water, it was all right. It wasn't the worst water I've ever had. (birds chirping) - The Highline Trail does cross what was the historic Carter Military Road. The Carter Military Road is named after this guy named Judge Carter. He was a veteran of the Seminole Wars down in Florida. He was out of the Fort Bridger Area, he was a sutler, which is the guy who supplies the army with all their equipment. It was a fairly lucrative business that he got through a friend of his. With the advent of the transcontinental railroad making access to the west a lot easier. And Fort Bridger being a nexus of things and you had all the settlement in the Uinta Basin, encroaching on what was also designated in 1861 as the Uintah Ouray Reservation. (tense music) So there was back and forth between a lot of the Native Americans and the settlers. So it obviously had a serious impact on the Ute folks, all three bands that are now on the reservation, two of them from Colorado that were forcibly removed. (Tense music) The Battle of Little Bighorn, also known as Custer's Last Stand is when basically the Seventh Cavalry was decimated by a fairly large conflagration of a bunch of different bands of Native Americans. And that was the first real defeat that the army had suffered at the hands of the Native Americans. So that of course sparked a lot of fear among settlers that they would be next if the army couldn't protect them. Of course there was mistrust on both sides. In the Uinta Basin after the Ute's were forcibly put on the reservation, the local settlers, white settlers wanted protection and petitioned to have a military encampment there. So military Fort Thornburgh was created. In order to connect the Uintah Basin with Fort Bridger and Carter, of course, probably for his own elevation on the fact that he could supply two military forts. Had this road made that crossed the Uintas. (birds chirping) - Good day hiking today, stayed hydrated, and there's the raw water out of this little puddle. That's not even really a stream. Probably moving very slowly, you had to dip. And then this is it, filtered, it's got a little red tint to it from the Kool Aid. So here we are set up I'm right in direct line of the sun. Somehow Joe always gets the best spot, so, that's why I'm here. - Well, we did about 10 miles today. We got hailed on just a little, bit got sprinkled on just a little bit, nothing to get us wet. Matt says it's about three miles to the next potential water source, it should be all right. (soft music) - Good morning - Well we had a little stormed kind of just kind of glanced us a little bit not too bad. The lightning was pretty dang bright. I almost had to crawl way up underneath my sleeping bag to kind of block a little bit of that out but besides that I slept great. Just love being out in the wilderness. Just something peaceful about it. You can just sleep forever but time to wake up, time to get going and we got miles to do. (upbeat music) - I got a nice rolling boil to get all the crap out of there just in case. - You gotta do that for about 10 minutes. - No, you gotta do it for like 60 seconds. - That's why your kind died off. (laughing) - I get blisters because I have a narrow heel and it slips up and down in a shoe and I get a blister no matter what I do. So this is a product made for hiking. If I don't put enough, I'll still get a blister. (laughing) - You should put honey on there. Put honey all over your feet. - Have you ever thought about that You're not the star of this film. (laughing) So stop trying to horn in on my time. (soft music) - Today's day three, we're gonna be venturing out of the forest into some of the higher mountains above treeline, we're gonna start hitting a bunch of lakes and streams and that water shouldn't be an issue going forward. It's only 10.7 miles today. But we have a 700 more feet of elevation gain than we did yesterday. So 2300 feet in total, which still isn't that bad, but elevation gonna still get you winded. - So as we were going down the trail, animals ran across it. - I was in front of everybody and off in the distance I saw what appeared to be full grown moose. - I saw it first, Will is gonna probably dispute that, but I'm like, look, look at the elk, look at the moose. I called them moose and the big dispute arose from that because Joe said "Those aren't moose" He and Will went into a big argument for about three days on this. - They had white butts, I've never seen a moose with a white butt. - I'm pretty certain they were moose. I'm gonna go ahead and stick with that. - We were heading towards a peak called Leidy Peak. And it was the first time that we were gonna go above treeline. - It's just so mind boggling, looking up at a mountain. It looks like it's just right there. When you get up on top of it, it's extremely high. It's just so hard to get the scale. But we climb up Leidy Peak, we get some cell phone service. Everybody's on their phones. - And I don't think anybody was really paying much attention to the sky. - We're all standing around taking pictures and I'm looking around thinking, I don't wanna be up here. This isn't looking good. That was a moment that I thought, sure enough... Okay this is where I die - A lightning strike got really close. Everybody freaked out. Right as we were at the high point, this thunderstorm just opened up and started hailing on us and lightning started striking all over the place. - There's a lightning storm right there, but there's not really anywhere to go. Except right down here. - And it was like a mad rush to get back down to the tree line. So we don't get burned into a crispy critter from a lightning bolt. - I owe Matt $20 bucks because it said it was gonna hail every day, I thought he was lying. - He was not lying. - Some hail hit me in a sensitive part. You can say, that wasn't so much fun. (screaming) - Once we made it down into the forest, it was pelting us. And the lightning was crashing right above us. I look over at Steve and he's got his cell phone up. And he was looking at a picture. And he turned his phone towards me and was like, look at my girlfriend. Isn't she beautiful? And I was like, damn. It was definitely a Steve moment. That's what I love about Steve. He wasn't even thinking about the lightning or the danger that he was in, he didn't care. He was just thinking about his girlfriend. (soft music) - Everyone scattered and we all got into cover and back into the tree line. So that cell exhausted itself and went away and we gathered up and got a game plan together. We pulled up the weather radar, and it showed another big cell just coming our way. So we got back down into the tree line just to be protected from any lightning strikes. So we're waiting it out, better be safe than sorry. - We wrote out like two waves of storms until the weather clear. - That was the end of our first real hail lightning storm. But then we didn't have cell phone service after that. - I didn't die there, so that's good, I'm still here. To hike another day. - That was probably the most fun part of the trip, for me. It was the only part when I forgot that everything hurt and that I couldn't breathe. - We reached the top of the plateau there, close to 11,000 feet, and it was like walking in a field. But on top of a mountain, I would say kind of like The Highlands or something maybe that you would imagine in Scotland. (upbeat music) - One of the really cool aspects of the Uintas is really they're a monument to 19th century science. The Uintas kind of formed a sort of a crossroads of what they used to call the great surveys of the West. You had the Hayden survey, the Clarence King survey that came out of California, John Wesley Powell, and they all kind of converged on the Uintas at about the same time at about 1870. They mapped the geology and they had paleontologists in toe. So if you look at a lot of the peaks, they're named after naturalist, geologists, explorers, surveyors, and paleontologists. (soft music) - So you have Untermann Peak. Untermann was well known for doing some of the early renditions of both dinosaurs and some of the early mammals and trying to make them lifelike and sort of bring them to life for the public, translating that from the bone to the actual animal itself. Leidy was sort of a gentleman scholar, also the father of Vertebrate Paleontology. So there's a peak named after him. He was one of the foremost paleontologists in the 19th century. (soft music) Marsh Peak is named after Othniel Marsh, A fairly famous sort of paleontological war took place between Othniel Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Marsh was associated with Yale, Cope was attached to the Hayden Survey for a while, and they were battling over the fossil fields of the West It was sensational enough that they basically warred with each other in the papers. When it started off Cope was in New Jersey and was actually getting some fossils from a rock quarry. Paleontologists would team up with rock quarriers and people that were miners and things like that and as they would come across things, they would then relate them to the paleontologists and that's how they would get a lot of their specimens. So Cope was down there and he was using this one quarry and he invited Marsh down to check it out. And then by the time he left, he didn't realize Marsh made deal with these guys and they started sending all the fossils to him. So basically these guys were constantly scooping each other's finds. So that of course put them at odds very early on. (old time music) With the transcontinental railroad, access and logistics are a lot easier. So once that sort of opened up, and everybody knew about the fossil fields of the West, it was almost like a gold rush but for paleontology. So these guys were always kind of trying to stake out claims, and then claim jumping each other's claims and then every time they would find something, they would rush into print so that they would be the ones to name it. And then trying to one up the other guy. That's why you would have maybe say something like, the Uintatherium it might have five different names, by the time it gets published, 'cause everybody's finding them and then naming them themselves. Marsh kind of had more the financial backing that he kind of pushed Cope out in a lot of ways while Cope was still able to find hundreds of different fossils and fossil fields. (old time music) Another big bash against Cope was, Cope had sort of a Plesiosaur, and he had mounted the head on the wrong end. So Marsh got a lot of traction out of basically trying to make fun of him and saying didn't know what he was doing. But then of course, Marsh is also famous for creating a Brontosaurus by putting the wrong skull on the wrong skeleton. Leidy was so disgusted with the whole Marsh and Cope war, going back and forth that he actually kind of bagged out of it and stopped investigating in the West. But overall, this went on and on they both died about the same time. There really wasn't a winner in the end, but volumes have been written about these guys. Cope is still the most highly published scientists in American history. In fact, actually what we've been talking about recently is even trying to nominate one of the peaks to be named after Edward Drinker Cope. (soft music) - Our first pass on this great hike was Gabbro Pass. And once again, you just can't get the scale you're looking at it going, how am I gonna hike over that? - Like most of the passes on this trail, it was a pretty vertical climb, it was Rocky. But for me the passes are my favorite part. So maybe some people dread them because it's a hard climb. But with each step that you take, every time you turn around and look back, the view just gets more spectacular. (soft music) - It was just gorgeous, just beautiful. - Gabbro Pass was really our first experience of what the next few days were gonna be like for us on this trail. - We ended up down at Deadman's Lake, not really a name of a lake you wanna be hanging out at, especially after nearly getting struck by lightning like multiple times. - Deadman Lake is named after the unfortunate body of a prospector that was found there by a couple of individuals later. The north slope is known to have fairly harsh winters. Even today, we lose people in the Uintas. So the idea that this prospector could be up there and run afoul especially, you know, back in the early days, when you don't have all the fancy equipment that we have now. It's pretty status quo back then you're really taking your life in your hands, especially as an individual going in there. It's an undertaking now, but to do it, say in the 1870s, or 80s, or 90s. It's a whole different ball of wax. (soft music) (coughing) - Today was probably one of the most eventful days of hiking I've had, it started off pretty normal and pretty awesome and then some crazy storms rolled in. I almost got hit by lightning, then it started to hail, which was kind of good because I won my bet with Joe that it would hail at least three times. So I won 20 bucks and then promptly a piece of hail struck me in my genitalia, which was pretty not awesome. But, it's funny now but wasn't really funny at the time. I haven't even looked, it could be bruised, who knows. - I feel like today was the first real day of hiking. After the storms past. It was beautiful and it felt like a ton of climbing. It was only supposed to be 2300 feet, but it felt like more. So it's a beautiful day. We're here at this beautiful pond tonight and we're gonna get some good rest 'cause tomorrow we've got it again, we got 12 miles and we're gonna probably be going over a couple passes. (soft music) - My name is Matt, I work for a backpacking company. I love to travel. I love my family and I love backpacking, and I love it when I can incorporate all three together. - The best way I can describe Matt, he lives his life with integrity. He makes it a point. He is really dedicated to his family. And that speaks to me, those two things speak volumes to me. I would say when it comes down to it, me and Matt are probably the two most alike people, even though we come from totally different backgrounds. - Growing up, I was a little explorer. I was always spending time in the woods. I was always building forts, going farther than my mom would like on my bike or my skateboard. I grew up with a single mother, so I never really got the chance to travel or go anywhere. As I grew up, like after high school, I was in a band and I used that as an opportunity to explore the country, go on tour, see places I'd never been before. And I learned through those experiences how valuable travel really was to me. - He was a singer in a heavy metal band. He's tattooed from head to toe. He's never been high, he's never been drunk, and his memory is like a steel trap. He will pull names and dates out of his memory. And you wonder, where does this come from? - Matt was the person that I instantly connected with when I met him. He's a fun guy to be around. On the trail, he's all for hiking 30 miles without breaking and it's hard sometimes to keep up with him. - My name's Kim Favero, I'm married to Matt. I'm a cardiovascular specialist. I met Matt on MySpace. He tells me he was impressed with my picture 'cause I was pretending to lick Borat on like a bus stop promotion for the movie. So that was enough to reel him in I guess. - And 11 months later, we were married. On my honeymoon, we stumbled across this trail in Canada and we just decided to walk down it and about 15 minutes in, I was in heaven. It was the first time I'd been in the woods in so long, ever since that day man, it led me to my job. It led me to so many adventures. Every time I go into the woods, I just wanna go back. - When I married Matt, I knew that it wasn't gonna be boring. I knew it was gonna be an adventure. I knew that for sure. (upbeat music) Matt's crazy passionate about everything he does, just unconventional. I can just list off so many weird things he does. He was in a band. - Matt's a good organizer of everything really. - He did A.M radio show. - He plans most of our hikes. - He was running all night scavenger hunt game. - He also for a while was running a soccer club. - He made t-shirts. He did screen printing till like four in the morning once. - That's what Matt does. He finds people and gets them together to do things. - People tolerate him pretty well. (laughing) (soft music) - My family came to be, again in true Favero fashion very unconventionally. And I think at the time, we were talking about having kids, and then we stopped talking about it because he had gotten laid off. We moved in with my mom, we just weren't really in the position at that time. And then I got pregnant. - So in 2010, my wife and I were working out of our garage, we were still building everything ourselves. It was getting to the point where we couldn't keep up with demand. As I got into backpacking, I stumbled across Joe's website, and I noticed that Joe had moved to the next city south of me Palm Bay. - Matt emailed and asked if he could come over and check out some gear. So he came to our house to our garage, checked out some gear and we talked, we ended up going out to lunch. And basically we ended up extending him an offer to be a seamster for us. So he was our first first outside employee. - We kind of just went with it and slowly got our lives back together structurally. And then Lu was born in 2010. (soft music) But then, a few weeks later, we found out she had a serious heart defect. - She had a couple holes in her heart and some other things. (beeping) - It was a really trying time for my wife and I because we were broke at the time, our living situation wasn't the best. And then we had this huge, horrible situation with our daughter and through it, I was still able to go on hikes, and it really helped me decompress. For me hiking lets me get into a place in my mind where I'm at peace with how I feel about things that have happened and how I would feel about things if they happened. And going through a difficult situation like that hiking really helped me stay strong. (heart beating) - From then on, she's just been everything. She's guided us through everything and everything has been for her. - My trail name is Champion. I like to hike with my family. The longest hike I've been on is Italy, France and Switzerland. 100 miles. I was the youngest kid that hiked it. In the world. (soft music) - The older I get, the more I realize life isn't about obtaining possessions. It's about obtaining experiences. What that translates to with my family is traveling together and hiking together. So the outdoors and hiking in general has become an experience that we share to build and foster our relationships with each other. (heart beating) (birds chirping) - Well, now today is day four, just got off, just got packed up, spent the whole night coughing so that wasn't great. We're meeting somebody and we're picking up our food drop today, and we're gonna go from hardly any food to a six days of food and so that's gonna be fun too. Oh, and then I guess we have like a bunch of passes to go over with all our heavy food. And we've got 13 miles today, so it's gonna be a big day for us, so there's that. (laughing) (birds chirping) - So we've been smelling smoke all morning. And you can see in the distance here that the sky is all hazy. You can smell it pretty good here. So we're wondering if there's fires nearby or how far away it is. Hopefully it's not gonna impact our route, but you never know. (soft music) - One of the great things about this hike was the community in the area, we actually had someone that was willing to drive out there and bring us our resupply. So this allowed us not have to carry 10 days worth of food from day one. - And we appreciate the kindness. Of the gentleman who did our resupply, a phenomenal guy. - Cameramen down. - There was a little unexpected event, we lost Gordy, our cameraman, he jumped off the trail 'cause he had extreme foot pain and blisters. - It's been a crazy four days seen stuff I'd never seen before. Vistas I never imagined I would see. Too bad my feet aren't hold up but.. It was cool, while it lasted, super cool. - Cool, we're gonna miss you Gordy. - See you in Salt Lake. - I'll try to meet you at the end of the trail. - All right man - Best of luck out there. - Stay safe - Take care - You too, it was awesome hiking with you. - We hated to see Gordy go 'cause we got attached to him, he was like became one of our own. But we definitely understand we've all been there. - So he was able to get a ride with Aaron off the trail. So he was out. - It left us with our producer and other cameraman and Matt and Benny. They picked up some cameras and they were taking shots as well. So we managed to get through it but Gordy did miss a great hike. (soft music) - Chipeta Lake is named after the wife of Chief Ouray. And he was one of the most well known Ute Chiefs that the government actually sort of identified to speak for all the Ute during the negotiations over the Uinta Ouray, named after him of course, Reservation in the Uinta Basin, where now the three bands of Ute's reside. - The Native American story in the Uintas goes back to the late Ice Age. We're talking about 15,000 years plus of human habitation in North America, it's not new. There's an archaeological culture called Clovis Culture. And we know that we have artifacts from very close to the forest, a famous Clovis cache of weapons was found. And those date back to say 14,000 years ago. - These are the folks that are still in the last waning stages of the Ice Age. These are the people that are still hunting mammoth, and hunting extinct forms of animals that we don't have any more. We've got some more severe weather patterns. We've obviously got lower sea levels, that's affording people to actually come across Beringia, which is the Bering Strait, coming down into the continental United States. - Time marches on, things change, the environment changes, people adapt to their sort of home range ecological zones, you see a little bit of diversity in that. We don't necessarily know how they were organized, socially. What they call themselves up until about the historic period when we do have all these other sort of Western Shoshone Piute and Ute bands that we see in more recent history that we can identify with the names that they still identify themselves with today. - Obviously, native people have a very different relationship and a very close relationship with the archaeology and history of their own people. As archaeologists, our job is to make that Native American history relevant to people that aren't necessarily of Native American ancestry, because I think a lot of our problem comes from people see things as the other, or they're not concerned about it 'cause they don't feel some sort of link to it with that sense of stewardship and that sense of time depth that we seem to always be yearning for. But we have. If it can just be recognized by more people as an American archaeology. This is an American history and we're Americans. - It really stunk to have to go on without one of the guys in our group, but you just got to keep moving. And that's what we did. We threw all that weight into our packs. And we took off again. We still kept an eye on Joe. I was kind of wondering if he was gonna bail at that point because he was in bad shape. In fact, I think, in my opinion, he seemed to almost be doing worse than Gordy. So I was nervous, and at that point, you know, I didn't know if we were gonna have other opportunities to get out of the mountains if it was necessary. - I'm feeling all right, right now. I've just been having a hard time breathing on all the up hills, and I feel like my lungs aren't working right. I can only breathe in like halfway and then it kind of like hurts. So I don't know exactly what's wrong with them, but I just have to go real slow going uphill. I was like, can't breathe, so I'm dealing with that but whatever, maybe it'll go away. That's what I'm hoping for. - Of course, as luck would have it, we got our resupply, and then immediately had to go up what is routinely considered the toughest pass on the Highline Trail, North Pole pass. - Every pass seem to be a little tougher than the one before 'cause we were going west going into more aggressive terrain. (soft music) - I'm not sure exactly what happened, but I think I had some kind of like, chest cold or chest infection at the same time as being at altitude. So when we got to North Pole past, what I was doing is putting one foot in front of the other like this, little bitty stops 'cause that's all I could do. - It seemed like it took forever to get to the top of that pass. I remember seeing this sign, thinking Ashley my wifes name is Ashley. So I thought about her a lot when I was sitting there at that pass. I love the outdoors, I love going backpacking. I love being out for days and weeks and months on the end. But I still miss my wife. - Well, today was day four. I will say it started off today and I was a little nervous because the smoke blew in. We could smell it when we woke up and I was thinking that we might be walking into a fire, but it sounds like that smoke is just blowing to us here from California and Oregon and maybe for some other smaller fires around Utah. So that's really good news. We'll see if it clears up because it still is a little hazy. (birds chirping) - Today was a tough day, man. Got up, walked a little bit, got our food drop, and climbed the biggest pass ever. North Pole pass with six days of food on our backs, seemed like it went on and on and on forever. Finally made it to the top came down the other side and ended up here in this grassy meadow, which is really nice, so I'm glad to be here. - So Joe's been having some trouble with the altitude and climbing at higher altitudes, he's having a real hard time breathing and getting a full, full breath inside. So he's been struggling, he's been coughing a lot. (coughing) If you know Joe, he's a tough dude. So he's gonna make it to the end for sure. But he's just dealing with some stuff right now. And we're concerned for him, but I think he's gonna make it. (coughing) - During the night, I woke up some where around two o'clock and I could hear Joe coughing. And I was a little bit concerned. (coughing) - I listened to him for, you know, probably 15 to 20 minutes just struggling to breathe in the middle of the night. And then I dozed off, but the next day, I just knew that Joe's trip might be coming to an end. - It was like the worst night's sleep for me ever. I got this cough that keeps getting worse and worse. So I don't know what to do right now. We're a long way from anywhere. So there's not really any great escape plan. I couldn't breathe so like I didn't blow my sleeping pad up last night. I was like I'm so short of breath. So in the middle of the night like I wanted to blow this thing up because I kept tossing and turning, but I just couldn't do it. So if it's worse tonight, I'm more screwed 'cause we're gonna be farther away from any escape plan. - Unfortunately, Joe was not getting any better. He seemed to be going slower. He seemed to be coughing more, and we were considering that a helicopter ride might be on the horizon for Joe to get him out of there. - When I got up, I knew that I wasn't feeling well. So I'd already started looking at my maps and trying to formulate an escape plan. And there was one trail where I could hike out to a trailhead near Fox Lake. And I was thinking well if I keep going and if it got worse, I don't know what I would have done because we would have been too deep into the mountains and it would have been like a multi day hike to get to a trailhead to get out of there. - We got to the end of Fox Lake and there was an old cabin and we sat down for a break. - We were all in good spirits except for Joe. He was real quiet and just kind of keeping to himself. - I remember I was sitting on a rock just exhausted, couldn't even move and everybody else is like dancing around and having a great time. Like they hadn't been hiking or anything. So we got to the end of the lake and there was a dam and that's where the trail splits off, where I knew I could hike eight miles and get out of there, if I wanted, I was like, well, I'm not dying, I'm gonna be okay. (birds chirping) (upbeat music) - Joe's got the beginning stages of pulmonary edema. So basically Joe's gotta bail. - So we hiked about another mile or so and Joe had had enough. He was coughing, he couldn't catch his breath. So he finally made the decision that he was gonna get out of there. - Somethings wrong with my lungs right now, so... - He said, "Look, you guys, I am not enjoying it. "I didn't sleep, I'm in pain, I'm coughing. "And on top of that, my hands are turning cold." And I noticed when he was holding his trekking staff that his knuckles were white that he knew at that point that there's just really nothing he could do. He needed to get out of there. And it just wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth risking his life. - And I think he made the right choice. Anytime you're dealing with that kind of issue, it can be life threatening. We had a brief discussion about a helicopter, a brief discussion about a horse. If you know Joe, he turned those down pretty quickly. - Hey, Gordy. - So we found an alternate route. We made a satellite call at Gordy who now was free. - I'm gonna hike like an eight mile side trail down to a trailhead and Gordy who got off yesterday. He's gonna come pick me up in the rental car. So I'm out of here, but I bet you guys will have fun. Five more days to go after today. And I'll see you guys at the end. - So we all said our goodbyes, and Joe headed down the trail away from us. And we were all pretty sad because we really wanted to complete the journey together but it just wasn't in the cards this time. (upbeat music) - It took me the whole day to do that eight miles. So it was probably 5.30 by the time I got down there. - How are you doing? - All right, how are you doing right? - All right. - Gordy had a pickup truck and he had a half of a turkey sub in the car and it was the most amazing sound I've ever had. All of a sudden I went from I don't feel like eating to, oh, I do feel like eating. It's amazing what getting in a air conditioned vehicle and knowing you don't have to walk anymore will do for your morale. I was a little disappointed that I wasn't able to finish the trail but at the same time, I just wasn't able to enjoy it at all with how I felt so it wasn't worth it. I was able to catch a flight out of Vernal, Utah, the next day. It was really good getting back home especially on this trip. It took me a couple nights of sleeping sitting up until whatever was wrong my lungs cleared out of there. So everything kind of worked out really well. - So we were down to five people. Four hikers and our producer cameraman. (upbeat music) - Well today, really the one thing that stands out to me is we kind of lost our captain, Joe, the most experienced hiker of the bunch. He had to check out early and I've hiked with Joe quite a bit, and I've never seen him like I saw him on this hike. So we're definitely gonna miss having him here with us. - We're kind of beding down for the night getting ready for another epic day tomorrow. We go to the highest point on this whole trip We'll be climbing Kings Peak. That's the highest point in Utah so that'll be cool. That'd be another high point state for me. I think we got a pretty tough time in the morning but I think a lot of us are ready for it. We're kind of used to it at this point. Should just be like another day on the job. (upbeat music) - Today, we are climbing up to Anderson Pass, the highest point on the Highline Trail and then we are gonna take an off-shoot up to King's peak, the highest point in Utah. So we'll see we're gonna be about, man, I think 3000 feet higher than we are right now. So it's gonna be pretty crazy up there, I'm excited. - I really am not crazy about climbing 700 feet straight up, but peer pressure got the best of me and I will be making that climb. - Today is gonna be awesome. We're gonna go really high and pass out because we're gonna not have a lot of oxygen. And then we're gonna hold up a sign that says, Kings Peak, and then we're gonna like do crazy faces like. UINTA!!! Now my throat hurts. UINTA!! - This was our big day. This was a day that we were looking forward to. But we were also a little nervous and apprehensive about because we knew we were gonna be doing a lot of climbing. - We weren't doing huge miles on the hike, we were only really doing anywhere from eight to 12. So that wasn't a big deal but being above 10,000 feet in elevation, a 3000 foot climb just feels so much harder. - We started making our way to Anderson Pass. It took a while. It meandered and switchbacked and we finally got there and it was the first pass that when you got to the top it was like dropping off a cliff on the other side and just a big expansive valley. - So we could already feel it, we could feel the elevation, but the views were just unbelievable. - We put our packs off to the side on some rocks and just start going up this peak, all of a sudden the trail disappears. The side trail to the King's Peak should not be called the side trail to anywhere because it is not a trail. It is simply giant rocks for 700 vertical feet, all the way to the top. - I've never seen a mountain like this before, it was just a pile of rocks, rocks that are about anywhere from the size of a coffee table to the size of a car. And you have to just kind of hop from rock to rock and just hope that you don't fall. - I don't think anybody really expected it to be as difficult as it actually was. Some parts of it, we were actually going hand over hand and it just kept going up and up and up and I complained, I bitched the entire way. I yelled at everybody, I was mad. I was like, why are you making me do this? You said I was gonna have cell phone service halfway up this mountain. That's the only reason I'm coming up this mountain so I can call my girlfriend, was their cell phone service? No, there was no cell phone service. (screaming) - It is completely rewarding being up here and doing it with these guys. Makes it all that much better. These guys let me tag along. I feel pretty grateful and lucky for that. - It was a good time, and here we are. - The Highest point in Utah. Here's to Utah. (screaming) - It's one of the reasons why I hike is for those moments and it was a moment that I'm not gonna forget. - We made our way back down Anderson Pass which took almost as long as it took to get back up because you couldn't move fast 'cause there's no trail. - We're all sitting there at Anderson Pass and we're just kind of relaxing and Will says, is that a patch of snow on the side of that mountain, I look at it and I seen the head move, I was like, no, that's a mountain goat. That's first time I ever seen a mountain goat. (soft music) (birds chirping) - So we're coming down from King's Peak, none of us were smart enough to bring enough water with us. So we're all out of water, we're in this valley. We can't find any, we're thirsty, and that sucks. (upbeat music) - So we saw some herds of sheep, two or three times, and you would hear 'em ahead of time. And I said, why are those sheep making so much noise? And Benny just makes this up. He says, "Oh, they're just trying "to tell each other that we're coming." And he was totally serious It was the biggest crock of crap. - I've never heard so much bahing in my life, like (baaah!). It was kind of crazy. - There are sheep drive lines that do cross the trail at times, we've had almost 150 years of grazing history in the Uintas. Sheep grazing mainly in the high elevations. And the Uintas are a primitive area, now they're a wilderness area, but it's still part of our public land system. So grazing is still an acceptable use. (sheep sounds) (birds chirping) - Well, today was definitely one of the hardest days of hiking that I've ever had. And that's saying a lot 'cause I've hiked a lot of miles, a lot of places, a lot of countries, but the climbing was pretty insane. And the sun was just beating on us all day long. The water was plentiful on the way up, but on the way down, we kind of ran out. So we were hiking without water for a while. So we were a little parched. Pretty much ran down the mountain so that I could get to water source. So as you can see, I'm in a reclined position right now that's because I'm literally about to fall asleep. I just ate my food. And I'm gonna go climb into my tent, and we're gonna do it all over again tomorrow. (soft music) - Usually I wake up a little chipper, didn't happen today. - My name is Steve Kaiser, and I'm 60. And I feel like my life has been a life of adventure and enjoyment, for the most part. - Steve is like a mix of a big brother and another father. He's just this big, jovial personality. He's always optimistic. He's a person who's not afraid to give a compliment. He will always find something positive to say about you to build you up and to make you feel good. - When you're down or you're feeling it. Your legs are feeling it. Steve will come up and he'll just make you laugh, and make you smile. - There's only so much oxygen here and I need it to breathe, not laugh. - And don't tell him that he's 60 years old because he's hiking with all us young guys. Sometimes he's moving faster than us. He pretty much started hiking with Joe and Matt right from the beginning. So all he's ever known is moving fast. So Steve is just crazy. Honestly, I really aspire to be like Steve, when I'm his age, you know, in that good of shape. - Steve is a crazy character, I absolutely love Steve. If you're not laughing when you're around Steve, then you're deaf. - I love hiking. Well, I love everything except the walking. - Can be moody at times so we tease him about that. He gets Hangry. - Look a bone! (growling) - But just a great guy who would do anything for you. - He's had a crazy life, you know, he's lived in a bunch of different places. He just has a lot of stories. He's a real interesting guy to hang around with. - I have some core passions that really have been with me all my life. I have to work with my hands. I do a lot of original designs, you know, nothing really too complex, more artistic. I make a lot of gifts for people. So woodworking and metalworking those are two very important core passions of mine and also fitness, I try to be as fit as possible. As a person, just my overall path in life, I just feel solid and I'm happy, I'm content and my life is perfect. (upbeat music) - Life before hiking, was, well, a lot transpired around the same time I started hiking, so my life is very different now. My life of addiction actually began when I was about three or four years old, being the youngest of five, I guess I was a surprise for parents that were over age 40. My two older sisters were 15 and 17 when I was born, and by time I was three, they were gone. So, back in the 60s they didn't know about abandonment issues and all of that, you know, it just wasn't a thing. But it's real, so my life changed at that time and I kind of went dark for 52 years. My parents back then they smoked about eight or 10 packs a day between them, just lighting one cigarette off the other, and so I would get cigarettes just take them, just steal them and they would never miss them. But I was addicted where I needed a cigarette. I was addicted by time I was four or five years old. From age 27, I had been involved with AA or NA, and most of my adult life from age 20 to age 55, I only had six years cumulative of active alcoholism or addiction. All those other years were just dry years trying to be sober, but miserable. And throughout my adult life, I had probably six bad spikes of depression where I really needed to go get help. I would go to AA, I would go to NA, I'd work the steps, I would get sponsors, and the story was always the same. When I was three years old. My two older sisters had left me so it just stopped right there. There was no more, there were no more questions about any other trauma. And so I had had other abuses that I didn't realize were a factor. And I struggled with that until I was about 55 years old. (birds chirping) I discovered hiking as a series of random events that began with reading a novel entitled, "Lone wolf." And in that novel, there were things mentioned about hiking and things like that or wilderness. And I got this idea of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. My motivation was pretty dark. Actually, I'd been to therapists and psychiatrists and nothing worked. Nothing could help, and suicidal thoughts were escalating. And my plan was to go out to California in 2014, and hike the Pacific Crest Trail and just die and just not come back. I was not coming back. I knew I just did not wanna live anymore. I researched probably 200 websites, looking at gear of just reading about it. I had not done any hikes at that time. That's how I met Joe Valesko. - Steve Kaiser is a good friend of ours. He started off as a customer, he had bought something or other and he came to the shop to pick it up. And we were going on a like a short section hike of the AT in a couple of weeks. And we just happen to ask him if he wanted to come on the hike with us. - And I thought, "what?" Do you see what you're looking at? I'm an old fat man, I can't even walk barely, you know, and here's Joe like not even 30 years old inviting me on this hike and I was a little uncomfortable with it wondering, what the correct answer was, of course, I wanted to go but I felt like, oh my God, I'm gonna be imposing on these people. Well, I went with him, his wife Sheryl and Matt Favero. That's when I first met Matt. He was a little scary at first, but really hit it off with them. (soft music) I went to treatment, and the therapist said, "I'm gonna put you in the trauma group." So I go the trauma group, and there's about three people in there plus the therapist. And she said, "Well, you know, Steve, why are you here?" And it just came out with this sexual abuse I had as a kid, 10, 11, 12, 13 years old, a couple of different incidences. And I remember saying it and then feeling this feeling inside. And I just said, "I guess it was important". And I just started sobbing. I had no idea I was carrying this around. I was free at that moment, because I'd worked on so many other things in my life. There really wasn't anything left, except that. Since then, I haven't had any more depression. No more thoughts of suicide at any level whatsoever. It was a very fortunate event, because I think a lot of people are walking around with those things that they don't know how to get rid of. And I was one of the lucky ones. - That was probably five, six years ago. And ever since then, he's been coming on almost all the hikes that we do. He does great, he keeps up with us, no problem. We have to keep up with him, half the time. (birds chirping) - All right, so today is day seven. It's gonna be one of our easier days. We've got about just a little over 10 miles and we 1700 feet in elevation gain, which is about half of what we did yesterday. We're gonna go over Tungsten Pass immediately. Then we've got Porcupine Pass, and then we're looking forward to that Red Beard dance party. When we get to camp early today. (upbeat music) - Growing up my dad always had nice minerals and rocks, you know around the house from places that he went. And so doing this hike, you just see all kinds. This just gives you a little sampling of these red, there's purple, there's green, there's yellow. Just beautiful. - My name is Ryan Buerkle, I'm the Recreation Program Manager for the Ashley National Forest. Once you're on the Highline Trail, especially in those high basins, you're gonna come along these big rock cairns, Six to eight foot high pile of rocks. And what those are for is for way finding. So you can see from one cairn to the next, and see where you're supposed to head towards. Because in that alpine tundra, there's not a specific worn in trail tread. It's just walking across a natural landscape. - Stone cairns are a difficulty for archaeologists, because you can't just date stones. So basically, unless someone's already identified them historically, and you can go back to a historic record and know that one was there. There's really no way to know necessarily when they were built. Sheep herders are a kind of well known for making some of the more complicated cairns that you might see, like some of the nice sort of cylindrical ones. The hard aspect of that too, is the fact that what you see in a lot of wilderness areas and public lands, especially in the West, is a lot of the hikers creating cairns themselves. Existing human infrastructure that's already there. That's historic, we like it and it's good stuff. But as far as creating new infrastructure or new structures, whether out of trees or rock or anything else, that's something that's kind of a big no, no in the wilderness, we wanna try to leave that as untrammeled as possible. (soft music) - I was walking along the rock path yesterday, one of the rocks turned over and the sharp edge of the rock went "pow" right into the side of my shoe. I screamed a few choice words at the rock and kept going and I just realized that hey, look at this. I got a nice bruise from it. - What are you gonna do? - Towards the end of our day, we got to a location and we stopped there initially just to take a break. But it was so incredible that we all just kind of came to the conclusion rather quickly that this was a great place to spend the night. (birds chirping) - Around 10.30 I climbed out of my tent. The stars were just incredible. They were unlike anything I'd ever seen before. And I just remember standing there and taking it all in for a few minutes before climbing back in my tent and going to sleep that night. (soft music) - Steve here, he had to go to the bathroom. We just started hiking so he went off into the woods to do number two. (laughing) (Elk calling) - No way. - He just got an Elk to freken call back at him. The Elk's like, "I wanna hang out with you". - It was amazing. (upbeat music) - As we climbed up Red Knob Pass, the beauty around us was just spectacular again like it had been on this entire hike. But once we reach the top of the pass, I'll never forget it. It was by far the best pass that we had been up so far. It was almost 360 degrees of mountains with a deep valley, almost a canyon. (upbeat music) - We did this right going from east to west on this trail. Every day was great. And the next day was even better and today was the best. The whole mountain range was just so much more defined and jagged and pretty. Everything was just better today. - My name is Benny Braden, I'm Electrician by trade, but I also have a great passion for backpacking. First of all, I'm follower of Christ, and I absolutely love my family. - Benny is Mr. Loyalty, if you need him, he'll be there. He'll drive hours to help you, he really values friendship, and he values a quality relationship, whether that be with his family, his friends or the hiking community. - Benny is one of the most passionate guys when it comes to hiking that I've ever met. He is pretty much always on a trail. He holds some records, he's the fastest person to ever hike. All the trails in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park is about 900 miles of trail. - I think Benny is the most physically fit 45 year old I have ever met in my life. - He's a man of few words. He's an electrician by trade, and I guess he's able to just stop his business and then his clients wait for him and when he gets back to town, he picks up where he left off and he's able to make enough money to basically support himself and support his hiking. - When I was growing up, I was, I like to say, I was a good son, I was a pretty quiet kid, and I really enjoyed just being outside. (soft music) In the early 2000s, I used to be an EMT. I did it because I would hope that someone would do something for my family member if they were in need. It is a great opportunity, I enjoyed it at the time. It's tough to do that job and have a normal life. We did all kinds of calls, mostly medical, that they could range from anything from a vehicle accident, to drownings. To spare everybody the graphic nature of that job, I just simply tell folks, I've seen people die every way they can possibly die. Those kind of events can really impact you mentally. Whenever I would leave a scene, I would just block it out in my mind as if it didn't happen, and I would go on with my normal daily routine. And when I was on call, if I was let's say extricating a person from a vehicle, I wouldn't make patient eye contact because it wasn't human at that point. I'd focus mostly on moving the metal of the vehicle to get that person out, and that allowed me to just kind of "out of sight out of mind". And that worked for years, until after I was completely out of the field. I first noticed the effects of it, shortly after we got married. I had a son from a previous marriage, and Ashley had her two daughters from a previous marriage. In addition to that, my brother passed away in that same time period, and he had two girls. Most people call it PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder. Nobody wants to be labeled with a disorder. So that's why choose simply to call it PTS. You try to block out some stuff but at some point in time, you can't block out anymore. It sent me into a very deep depression. - To see Benny go through PTS was really heartbreaking. It was kind of like walking on eggshells all the time. - I would just become a monster I would yell and scream. Not just at Ashley, but at the kids. - Then he would leave and he'd say gone through the night he would go park in a parking lot and sleep. - And before I knew it, there was an attempt at suicide. I woke up a day or two later, being evaluated in a mental hospital. - That was definitely a hard thing to go through. And I did a lot of praying. But I knew that there would come a time where it would be over. So you just have to like, work through it. And I wasn't gonna stop loving him no matter what. - Whenever I'm on a long hike, I pray a lot. Talk to God a lot, just try to clear out my mind. And I started seeing some answers. It's like I have a huge desk in my brain and is just piled up with images of different events. It's like I can take one of those images and look at it and pray about it, meditate about it, and try to make some sense of it. Now some things I don't ever make sense of, like why did this one child have die? Or why did this family have to suffer this loss? Some things I simply cannot answer, but I'm able to make sense of it. So that allows me to move on. Then I can pull another image. Now it might take me a day to deal with that. It might take me the whole hike to deal with it, but at least that's one situation that I've dealt with. And I can move on. My whole demeanor was different, it was changing me. Every day I would be out in the woods, it was changing me. I was less aggressive with my discipline, with my words. It softened me up - We're closer as a couple and closer with kids. He's a better husband, and a way better dad. - Well, my life now is a lot different than what it used to be for sure. And I'm so thankful, I couldn't have scripted my life any better than what it is. And it's all thanks to long distance backpack. And of course to God. A lot of answered prayers. Our time together is very well spent and is cherished 'cause we know how life used to be. (birds chirping) (cheering) - The finish!! - Congratulations! (cheering) - Good job Benny! - You beast! - Good job Benny! (laughing) - Careful. (upbeat music) - Best pass so far. No doubt definitely the sketchiest pass, my gosh. - Amazing, geeze. - You can definitely knit a hat out of that. Yeah, I love wool hats. (upbeat music) (thunder roaring) - I was just in the worst hailstorm in my life basically it started off pretty tame and then it just got crazier and crazier and heavier and heavier. - It only lasted for maybe three or four minutes. And then we were able to really just jump out of our tents and hang out together and just enjoy each other's company. As we experienced our last night on the magical Uinta Highline Trail. - The final day. Me and Will are some of the first to wake up. We're sitting there taking pictures of the sunrise reflecting off of the lake, and all of a sudden, I thought Will was gunna choke on his coffee because he's like, "moose! there's two moose!" - We're seeing two moose right now, right in front of us. It looks like a male and female. It was really a special moment for me on this trip. And I'm like pumping my arms and I was like yeah. - What a great ending. Really, I don't think we could have scripted it any better. To have these incredible majestic animals just walk out. And it was a great experience really, and something I'll never forget. (upbeat music) - The thing I missed the most every time I'm on the trail is my wife and my daughter, I know that sounds cliche, but it's totally the truth. - What I miss on this hike is just communicating with people that I talk to every day. We've gone so many days without any phone service. You know how it is it's traumatic. - The thing I miss the most is my girlfriend, Joelle and just my life in Gainesville and the farm. - I miss my wife, my beautiful bride, miss my kids, the last couple days just before you start going back home, you start anticipating what that moment is gonna be like whenever you reunite. - The thing that really means the most to me in life are my relationships, because you can't buy them. You can't fake them. You have to earn them through shared experiences. - I can be in the country, I can be in the woods, I can be in the city, and enjoy myself no matter where I am. I guess what's most important is who I'm with. - Yey! - Yeah! yeah! - Another one done baby! - 104 miles. - It was incredible. I couldn't imagine finishing up my summer hike, any other way at any other place, than on the Uinta Highline. - And it's just one of those things you kind of have to just chase after your passions and you don't know what tomorrow is gonna hold and that's the whole excitement about long distance hiking, you don't know who you'll meet the next day, you don't know where you'll sleep the next day. - Everybody spends their time indoors. You know, you go from in your house, to in a car, to in an office, back to in your car, back in your house. So I think you know, getting outside is important for everybody. - My children are watching. We don't only teach our children right from wrong, but we also teach them how to live. Do we want them to be ordinary? Or do we want our children to be extraordinary? We lead by example? - I'm so grateful for my life and I love the experiences and the adventures that I've been on in the last few years. I look forward to what's to come. - It's our path, and this is where I'm supposed to be, right now, at this very moment. And what we do next, matters. (soft music) - All right, day night, oops, day night. Okay, it's day nine. (laughing) - Take 12 Matt. Day nine. - He's really struggling with it - My favorite animal. I don't know if I have a favorite animal, maybe the honey badger, 'cause they're pretty badass (laughing) - Hi! Make a happy face. - Make a silly face Lu - That's awesome. * Lets get physical, physical * We're gunna get physical, physical, yeah * (laughing) - That was wonderful. - Please don't put that in the video. (soft music)
