(dramatic suspenseful music) - Alright, you know your job, right? - Piece of cake. Hey, where's Karen? - She's coming, she thinks we're nuts, as usual. - Good evening ma'am. That's a lovely color on you. - Sorry, visiting hours are over. - Really? I didn't realize it was so late. I'm here to see my grandfather, he's dying. - Yeah? - Yeah. He just kinda went downhill after grandma died last Mother's Day. - [Attendant] You don't say? What's his name? - Simmons? - Simmons. - [Guy] Wilfred Simmons. - Sorry, don't see him. - Oh, well I guess he musta checked out. Thank you. - You're right, he probably died. - I beg your pardon? - You know expired, croaked, kicked the bucket, cashed in his chips. What do you take me for? Last time it was your uncle. And then the time before that it was your sister. What was it, a car accident. She's home by now I take it. - It was a miracle. - Jason this is crazy, come on. - No come on, she's on the phone. This is perfect. It's gonna work, I told you. - Did I mention that you volunteers on the guild are doing a marvelous job? - Yeah, yeah I see 'em. Hold it right there. I've been expecting you, but-- - Rush hour, can we see him? The best time to see him's gonna be in the morning. He's much more awake then. - Well could we at least look at him? Please? - Okay. (machines beeping) - Thanks. - Thank you. (boys hollering on video) - Hi honey. Still up huh? - How was Larry? - Bill. - Bill. Do I know Bill? - Yes, you know Bill. Did you see him tonight? - Kind of. That was only a couple months ago. You couldn't even tell he had leukemia. So how you feeling today? - [Sick Guy] Okay. Bad hair day though. (laughing) - How do you do it? How do you stay so up? I mean I'm not lying in here all the time and I just don't have it. I mean I just don't have the courage that you have. - I just feel like I know what my life is about. And I know I'm loved. - Yeah. I've been loved before. It's highly overrated. - There's a difference Jason, my faith never leaves me. - Your religion. You've talked about that. All the time. I don't see what you're seeing. - You're right, you're missing the main thing, the most important point. - [Jason] So then what is it? - You gotta see it clear. (sad music) My friend's love. - [Woman] Jason, you'll have to leave. - [Jason] He was about ready to tell me something. - He loves you Jason. - Matt I gotta go. I'll be back here this afternoon. You can tell me then, okay? (bell rings) - Did you see that chocolate pudding? If I had $2, I'd be eating a cup of that chocolate pudding right about now. - [Jason] What do you think he meant by it? - By what? - He said "You've gotta see it." See what? - Beats me. You know every time I visit him, I just listen and nod my head a lot. You know he's always on those pain killers. - No, no, he was trying to say something very important. I just wish I knew what it was. - The conclusion I've come to is that the careers we choose are the most important thing in life. And through our career, each of us has the opportunity to leave the world a better place than when we first came. Thank you. (class applauds) - [Teacher] Thank you Elizabeth, very much. Quiz tomorrow on the first two chapters of Romanticism. Jason, remember you have the speech Thursday. - Great, that's all I need. What's her problem? - Pete just broke up with her. What a jerk. - Why? - What do you mean? - I mean what did she expect? - (scoffs) Jason! How can you say that? - Nothing lasts anymore. Nothing's permanent. - What has gotten into you? This whole thing with Matt is really getting to you. What happened to the guy who used to joke? The one who used to sneak into hospitals? - I don't know, out looking for something I guess. - [Man On P.A.] Dougherty 301, Dr. Dougherty 301. - What are you doing? - What do you mean? I'm here to see Matt. - Jason, you can't. (sad music) - Where is he? - Jason, I'm sorry. - Huh? - It happened just after you left this morning. - [Woman] I'm so sorry sweetheart. - I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. I didn't get to ask him what he meant. - [Woman] What he meant by what? - He was trying to tell me something. - [Woman] What? What's this? - It's from Matt. They found it in his room. - Don't forget my friend's love. What does that mean? - [Jason] Who knows. Who knows what anything means anymore. - Oh honey. (bright music) - "Do not let your hearts be troubled. "Trust in God, trust also in me. "In my father's house there are many rooms. "If it were not so I would have told you. "I am going there to prepare a place for you. "And if I go and prepare a place for you, "I will come back and take you to be with me. "And you will be where I am." - Do you wanna go? - Why don't you guys go on without me? I'll be there in a minute. - You sure? - Yeah. (sighs) - [Man] Was he a friend of yours? - [Jason] Yeah, he was my best friend. - [Man] Wow, musta been a great guy. - He was a great guy. - [Man] Lotta people showed up, huh? Musta been pretty popular, good looking, athletic. - Yeah, so what's it to you? - Hi Jason. (frantic music) - Matt? - Aw, look what you did to my flowers? Would you get off of me? (Jason yelps) Don't you have any respect for the dead? - What are you doing here? - Well it is my funeral. Why, wasn't I invited? - Sure, I guess. - (blabbers) A little shocked? (laughs) - I'm working down to that. - Ah, give me a hug you big lug. (laughing) - You got your hair back! - Yeah. - Is he still doing it? - Yeah. - Jason, I'm here because we never got to finish our talk. - Yeah you left me with a major mystery to solve. What in the heck was this note all about? And what was the one thing that you finally put it together for? - In the hospital you asked me what the most important thing is. - Yeah, tell me, I wanna know. - I don't wanna tell you, I wanna show you. But I have to take you some place to see it. - I was afraid of that. - Come on. Come on! - Okay, fine. It's not like I have any plans. Why not spend the afternoon with a dead guy? I can't believe you're here. Wait, where are you going? - Come on. Would you come on? I love this. (Jason exclaims) (laughing) - Jason, come on. The most important thing in life is-- - Hey, what's in here? - Ah, don't go in there. I gotta, I wanna show you-- - No wait a minute, come on. - No, that's not important right now, Jason. - Wow, what is this? - Can I help you? - Yeah, what do you guys do here? - We keep records. - Records of what? - Sin. - Sin? - Yep, every sin committed, we get it down. Nothing gets missed, overlooked or lost. Look, it's what we do. Make a record, get the evidence ready. - Evidence? What evidence. Ah listen, just outta curiosity, you wouldn't happen to have the-- - The Jason Reynolds file? - How did you? How did you know my name? - We have everybody's name here. I'll get your print out. - Don't go to too much trouble. - Oh, they're very helpful. - What is all this? I can't even remember half this stuff. - No, not stuff, sin. Big difference. You may not remember, but we get it down anyway. - You mean you have every sin down that I ever committed? - Yep. Every one. - Jason, I used to think sin was no big deal, that it didn't hurt anybody. I was wrong. It hurt me, it hurt others. And it hurt God. Jason, listen. - No, no, you listen. You're making way too big a deal outta all this. - No, I'm not. - You know how embarrassing all this is? To see all this stuff printed out? Stuff I not even dare mention, that I never even told you. - Alright, I know it's embarrassing, but the consequences are devastating. What I'm trying to tell you is that there's a way out if you'll just let me show you. (gavel pounding) - [Man] Next case. - [Woman] Your honor, case number 458355332. - [Man] Very well, proceed. - Your honor, the defendant may appear to be innocent, but the law is not interested in appearances. You must look deeper, below the surface. And below the surface he is guilty. Your honor, you know the law as well as I do. It is our obligation to uphold that law. - What's all this? - Jason, with sin there's a price to be paid. - (laughing) What price? - You'll see. - Your honor, the evidence has been put before this court. It is unmistakable and undeniable. - Remember that time when you broke into that house and your father's lawyer got your off on that technicality? - So what? - That doesn't work here. - Your honor, the prosecution has made it clear that Todd Martin is guilty. - What, what, I know this guy. From school. Why is he on trial? What's he ever done? - Todd Martin, how do you plead? - I don't know. I tried to live a good life. I went to church sometimes. I was a better person than most of my friends at school. - I'm sorry son. But you leave me no choice. I declare you guilty as charged and sentence you to eternal separation. - No, they can't do this, this isn't right. If guys like Todd can't make it, then what chance? - [Judge] Next case. - Your honor, case number 45855332, Jason Reynolds. - [Judge] Is there any evidence to be presented? - Trust me your honor, plenty. (ominous music) (laughing) (crowd shouts) - [Crowd Member] Crucify him. Crucify him! Crucify him! Crucify him! (man exclaims) - Stop it! - This is what I wanted ya to see. - What are you talking about? - My note. Don't forget my friend's love. This is my friend's act of love that I didn't want ya to forget. He loved you enough to die for you. Without him you'd be guilty and have no defense. - Wait. (unsettling music) But this isn't fair. He hasn't done anything wrong. - Yeah, but we have. And without him, we have no hope and we're all guilty. (man exclaims) - He's dying. Why is he doing this? - Because he loves us. And be... - Because of my sin? - Yeah. (hopeful music) I wanna be forgiven. What do I need to do? - Trust him. Believe in him as your savior. Believe with your whole heart. And follow him as your Lord. It's you and him buddy. (thoughtful music) - I do believe in you. Forgive me. Sin. - [Man On Cross] It is finished. - They're gone. Your sins. They're forgiven. Do you see clearly? Don't forget my friend's love. - All this for me. For us. - Jason you asked me where my confidence came from. It's in knowing that I'm loved by someone who will never leave us. I pinned all my hopes on him. And for that he's given me assurance. Don't you think we should tell others that they can have this peace too? (upbeat music) - [Jason] Where is he? - Jason he not only died for you, he lives for you. - What do you mean? - He not only sits at the right hand of the father, declaring our innocence, but he also lives with us, so we're never alone. Come on. - Now where? - I wanna show you one other place. I want ya to have this. We can never forget that the cross is the only way to the father. When you go back you need to let others know. - I want to, but will they believe? - You've got your work cut out for you. The problem is people don't realize the consequence of their sin. They don't see their separation. - Jason! Over here. - Mom! - I'll come over. - She can't cross. - Mom stop, you can't cross. - Why, what's wrong? - It drops off, you can't make it. You need the cross. - It doesn't drop off. There's no danger. - No Mom no, stop. Don't go any farther. You can't cross. - Don't be ridiculous, it's alright Jason. - She can't cross. Stop her. - But Mom, stop, don't. No! - Wait! (Jason sobs) - Mom! - What, what happened honey? - Mom, I had this dream that Matt and I were on this bridge and you tried to cross and you couldn't cross - Oh honey, sweetheart, - and we tried to stop you, but you wouldn't listen to us. - it's okay. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. Oh honey, I'm late for work. Can we talk about this tonight? - We're definitely talking tonight, okay Mom? - Are you gonna be okay? - (laughs) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna be okay. - I really wanna hear about your dream, but I'm late for work. - Okay. - Bye. - Mom, we're gonna talk tonight? - Yes honey, we'll talk tonight. Bye. - And she just kept falling and falling. I'm telling ya, it was as real as you and me sitting here. - Now, your list of sins, did that include the one when you and I? Whoa. They didn't miss a trick. - Jason I think it's clear what needs to happen here. - Yeah. I need to get myself a good criminal lawyer. - Jason, I know Matt was your best friend and everything, but you're letting this really stress you out. I mean, I understand how you feel. But you need to get on with life. - Yeah, I mean Matt was our friend too, you know? It's okay to remember what he stood for. But you need to chill our a little bit. I mean life goes on, right? - You guys, we're gonna be late for class. We'd better go. - You okay? - Yeah. - Good. Gimme two bucks for desert. (peaceful music) - We've been asked to speak on what the most important thing in life is. As most of you know, in the past week, I lost my best friend Matt. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever had to go through in my entire life. But through all this, Matt helped me find what is the most important thing in life. I'd like to tell you about it. (uplifting music)
