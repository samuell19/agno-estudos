So Jungle Jumper. It is once again the hour of our daily ritual. If it is today that you possess the swiftness and agility, to grasp the object from my hand before I remove it, the moment will have come for you to pass through our gates. And meet the vast world beyond. Will you be quick, little Jungle Jumper? Will destiny bequeath this as the instant of your triumph? Will destiny bequeath this as the instant of your triumph? Catch me if you can. Nyah nya nyah na nyah nya. Wise is a the man who knows when to lease house-pet of whom he cannot control or teach anything more to. Your time has come, Jungle Jumper. I will make of you a gift. For wise also is the man who sends his problems to so-called friends who will accept unusual offerings without knowledge of the background of said offering. Very well. I shall cease pronouncements of philosophical crap. Look, kid. You want to go. I want to get rid of you. I think I can dump you on the United States. But let me give it to you straight. They won't buy the con unless you sound more important. What I mean is that cutesy name. Jungle Jumper. Just don't cut it image wise. We got to call you something with more of a zoo biz sound, dig? Like Prince Kong. Or Mighty Joe Useful. You know, something that will make people wonder what you are. King Kong Fu is making steady progress toward New York City. Yes, the Chinese gorilla will be here soon. As you may recall, the State Department announced two weeks ago that Al Kong Fu, the most celebrated Karate and Kung Fu master in China, has made a gesture of peace and friendship from his country to the United States by donating his lifelong house pet, a gorilla, to the New York City zoo. In this film, taped via satellite, we see the famous teacher on the day he made his generous gift. With oriental dignity, he calmly explained with tears in his eyes as being the result of a painful broken arm. But we suspect that bidding farewell to his King Kung Fu hurt more than he cared to admit. In any rate, the ape arrived safely in San Francisco one week ago. And is now being transported across the country by Amtrak. There will be a brief pause in his journey out west somewhere to let the rednecks gawk at him. And so King Kung Fu has finally arrived in Wichita to begin his week-long Midwest exhibition. Is he awesome? Is he ferocious? Is he mean and ugly looking? Search me. As you can see, officials are pulling another cover-up. And won't even allow us members of the working press to have a peek. We don't like that. Still all of us, including you ordinary citizens, will have the chance to see the world famous Chinese gorilla in person when he goes on display tomorrow at the Sedgwick County zoo. The presentation ceremonies are slated for 2 o'clock. Reporting from Union Station, this is Arky Fudd. Huh? What? I thought we went to a commercial. Uh. In other news, the city commission today voted to… That makes me mad. They put that hick Arky Fudd on TV. And let him cover a big important story. But they won't hire us. Can you figure it? I can't figure it, Bo. Well, it ain't just talent. It's who you know. I know, Bo. Well, how can you take itself calmly? Sure, it hits me in the gut every time we watch the news. Is that guys in there and I'm out here. But doesn't the photography ever get to you? Didn't you see that? The lighting was terrible. Even an amateur knows you're supposed to keep the sun over your left shoulder when you take pictures. Those were night scenes, Bo. They shot it earlier tonight. Well… Then he should have kept the moon over his shoulder. Do you want a beer? - Sure. - Good. So do I. Herman, what we need is a scoop. Yeah but it couldn't be just any scoop. It would have to be something big. Yes, folks. It was horrible. It was ghastly. It made you want to puke. What? All I said. What we need if we want to break into TV big is a scoop. - A scoop? - Right. If I could get a really big story and you could get film of me getting it, TV stations would come begging to our door. We could write our own ticket. I'd be a star. Yeah, but how do we do it? The police always chase us off when anything happens. Because we don't work anywhere. Well, we don't want anything the police know about or anybody else. What we need's an exclusive. Something exclusive and big. Big big big. What's the biggest thing in town, Herman? Oh, that gorilla, I suppose. - Hmm? - That gorilla on TV. At least I suppose he's big. Yeah. That gorilla. But everybody already knows about him. What's his name? King Kung Fu. The wheels are clicking, Herman. The wheels are clicking. What's the number of the Pizza Hut, Herman? I don't know, Bo. Hello, operator. Would you dial me P for pizza? Rock Road Pizza Hut. May I help you, please? I'd like to speak to Miss Rae Jean Fey, please. Yeah, just a second. It's for you. Thanks. Hi. This is Rae Fey. Bo Burgess. Who? Bo Burgess. You know, the guy who likes eggplant pizza. Listen, baby. You still waiting for the big break? You still want a modeling career? Well. Yes. Cookie, this is your lucky day. Lightning just struck. Bo Burgess is going to make you famous. What do you mean? I mean tomorrow afternoon when they present that Chinese gorilla. You do know about the Chinese gorilla? Yes, I've heard about him. Great. Well, tomorrow when they have the opening of the exhibition. And all the bigwigs are there. And all the TV crews. And newspaper reporters. And everybody. Just before they unveil this King Kung Fu, we're going to unveil you. You're going to streak the ceremony. Huh? She hung up. Is that the chick who always waits on us when we get pizza? Yeah. Rae Fey. Why would she hang up? Well, she seems like a nice girl though. She would serve my mother if she'd streak. Been locked up for it twice. Yeah but the streaking fad is about played out. I don't think it would be much of a scoop anyway. Herman boy. The scoop will be when the gorilla gets loose and goes after her. The gorilla gets loose? Hey. What does that name make you think of? King Kung Fu? Oh, Bo, it'd never work. Well, why not? Well, in the first place, you had a falling out with the girl. And gorillas only fall in love with humans in the movies. You got to have a pretty girl. Look, Bo. There's no way he can get out of that cage anyhow. He can't bend the bars and break chains and whatever. You're gonna let them out. Before they drop the curtain off that cage, you're going to slip underneath. And unlatch the door. Okay, Bo. It's fantasy time. The chick's not gonna do her bit anyway. So I'll agree to it if it will make you happy. Don't worry. Don't worry. She'll do it. Testing one two three four. Hey, chum. Wave if you can hear me back there. Okay. Ready, Agatha? Ready, Margo. Do you imagine our letter to the zoo had any effect, Myrtle? One can only pray so, dear. But I suggest you be prepared to cover your eyes when they open that curtain. Perhaps we should do it now just in case the wind blows it open. Perhaps we should. Ain't you done with that yet? Almost. When we gonna be there? Yeah, she said she'd meet us by the giraffe. She's going to streak? Well, when I gave her the beauty and the beast angle and told her the #1 men's magazine promised to print it, she started to come around. Except she didn't want to streak. She insisted on wearing a bikini. Well, I said, I'll have to check that out with Hap. When I called her back and told her you'd given the okay, she agreed to the deal. You talk to Hap? Sure. He said to give his best to you too. He did? But he doesn't even know who I am. He doesn't know me neither, you dodo. Now watch out with that stuff. Your spilling it all over yourself. I don't know about this, Bo. Well, what do you mean? That's banana oil, right? Monkeys like bananas, right? We make Rae think of suntan oil. She puts some on. That gorilla'll dig her, right? And that solves the problem of him having to fall in love with her, right? Oh, it sounds like it'll work. Okay now, watch out. We're almost there. Now we get the car parked. I'll go find Rae and talk her into putting some of that on. You set your camera here. I'm going to hightail it around behind and open that cage door, you hear? Hey, baby. You ready to go? Oh, hi. Yes I guess so. Terrific. My cameraman Herman is getting set up right now. You know Herman. He eats with me all the time. The little guy who stuffed pizza in his ear the other night? That's Herman. Whale of a photographer even if he has a messy eater. He's going to make you look fantastic. Not that you don't look already mind you. I guess. That is, could I have a look? You know, strictly for professional assessment. Oh, sure. Miss Fey, did anyone ever tell you that without your glasses, your beautiful. Oh yeah. All sorts of crazy things. Oh, I'll bet. Say, that bathing suit sure doesn't hide your hide, does it? Oh, that reminds me. I worried about you getting a sunburn out here so I brought this tanning oil along. Oh, I never burn. Thanks anyway - Never burn? - Nope. Suppose we ought to go now? Well, maybe put some on. You know just to be sure. That's awful thoughtful of you. But honest, I'll be fine. And I hate that stuff. It's always so goopy. - Goopy, huh? - Goopy. I really think we better be going. The crowd starting to thin. What's a famous Chinese gorilla? Hi, monkey. Me fliend. Oh, Herman will be here any second. He's probably checking out the light up there. What if he doesn't make it back? Now don't you worry. We'll do our part. You just get up there near the front. When I give you the nod, dump the robe and hop on the stage, okay? If you say so. Oh, hey, listen. Before you go, are you wearing any perfume? Perfume? Why? Well, I thought if you wasn't, you might feel uncomfortable. You know. Unfeminine. This suntan oil smells pretty good. And I thought if you- No thanks. No thanks. No thanks. That's just great. Me, Nader Raider. Me come check on page for defect. I've got it. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you here today to the festivities. As we introduce the latest acquisitions, in the latest cultural exchange with the People's Republic of China. The famous gorilla, King Kung Fu. Before the official presentation, we had hoped to have representatives of your county and city commission speak to you. Unfortunately, as usual, they are not on speaking terms. Moving right along. Instead, we ask you to endure a brief concert. A medley of old Chinese favorites. With Sigmund Heils and the junior high German band. Sig. Ah one, ah two and three. Nyaaahhhh. Thank you very much. Sig and the boys. And now. The moment we've all been waiting for... approaches. Are your eyes tight shut, Agatha? Of course, dear. Are yours? Since you asked. Ladies and gentlemen. May I present to you the one, the only, King Kung Fu. Who are you? What are you doing in there? Well, basically I'm trying not to make him mad. And that was the disastrous scene which marred today's ceremony at the zoo. Because of the disruption, the presentation was postponed. But tomorrow afternoon at two, King Kung Fu will again be officially welcomed to Wichita. Just why the unidentified streaker wished to malign this symbol of our friendship with the People's Republic of China is not known. But authorities suspect communist affiliations. Is that it? Are you a commie? How can you ask that, Bo? What about my Ronald Reagan Right or Wrong bumper sticker? Herman. This is hard for me, Herman, because I'm mad. - But I'm going to forgive you. - Hey, thanks. Bo I'm going to forgive you because I know you're gonna get it right tomorrow. Huh? You heard the man. They're going to try it again tomorrow. Well, so are we. Oh no. It's too good of an idea, boy. Too big of a scoop. We gotta let that rascal loose. How, Bo? We can't try the same silly thing we did today. Yeah, I know. The streaking part has lost all of its publicity value. Since it's already been done. It wasn't my fault. He peeled me like a banana. Well, how about this? I talk to them official fellas. And get them to include the girl in the presentation. I don't care how you work her into it. I'm not going to pick that lock again. You owe me one, Herman. Well, I suppose I do. Listen, that's a circus wagon, isn't it? Don't they have trapdoors in the bottom to help clean the cages? All you have to do is climb under the bottom and pull the latch on the trapdoor. That gorilla will never even see you. Much less get at you through the bars. You think so? This is Bo, Herman. Would I lie to you? Would I deliberately place your life in danger? That hurts, Herman. That really hurts. Oh. Oh, all right, Bo. I'll do it. Swell, pal. I knew I could count on you when the chips are down. You're great, Herman. Great. And the two of us make a terrific team. Herman and Bo. Always together and fiercely loyal. Right? Right, Bo. Well, I've got to get ready. I'm going out. Where are we going? I'm going alone, Herman. Oh. Got me a date with Miss Rae Jean Fey. You didn't see her in that bathing suit, buddy. I figure if she's going to get mauled by King Kung Fu tomorrow, she might as well be mauled by old Bo tonight. Oh. So I used my contacts and I got a hold of that director. What's his name? A Humpley. Say, I said, that's quite a mess you had out at the zoo there today. Well, after he quit cussing, I told him if he was gonna do any better tomorrow, he'd need all the help he could get. Naturally, he wanted to know what kind of help I meant. Zane, I said. I mean female help. In the form of one Rae Fey wrapped up in an electric skin bikini. Don't you realize that's an endangered species, he asks. Being quick on the uptake I come back, Buddy, you got no idea how endangered until you see her. That's nice. Oh, now, Rae. I hope you meant that was meant with no disrespect to you. I was just softening him up with a little man talk. Uh-huh. Hmm. Well, anyhow it worked. When King Kong Fu goes on display tomorrow, you'll be the little lady that opens the curtain. You might even say you'll undrape the ape. Rae, what the heck's the matter? I just like to know why you brought me here to eat? Don't you like pizza? I love it. I love this place. But I work here. Oh. You're mad because I asked that guy for your employee discount? No, I'm not. I'm mad because they were so busy I had to wait our table. Well, why? I left you a tip, didn't I? What are we going to do now? Go down to the Sears warehouse and watch the trucks unload? Oh, I thought it might be my place or yours. Suppose it's my place first, where I can get out. And your place second, where you can go (honk honk) Yes, I thought they'd never do anything on that young man yesterday. We must've watched him parading in his underwear for at least five minutes. It was a seven minutes 43 seconds, dear. But what if there's no trapdoor? If there's no trapdoor, then I can't get hurt. Trapdoor? Can I help you, sir? Sorry, no interviews. Oh you got me wrong, sir. I'm Bo Burgess. The fellow who called you last night. No comment. What? The guy who called with the idea to have a girl on stage to unveil the monkey. Oh, yeah. Well, listen. I told you then. And I'm telling you now. This ceremony is much too solemn and dignified for such vulgarity. So just go away. Oh. You were bad enough last night. But at least I thought you were honest about this. I never want to see you again. Uh, Mr. Humpflea. Young man, if necessary, I'll call a policeman. This little gal may qualify as a meter maid. But I doubt it. Why the committee and I would be most pleased if you join us Miss… Fey. Rae Fey. Yes, I'm certain your presence would enhance the proceedings immensely. Uh, the leopard skin, it is imitation, isn't it? Is it that obvious? No, obviously it isn't. I mean. The leopard. The leopard is a beautiful animal. Hey, what about me? Hey, don't I deserve thanks or apologies? Now then, this is a great day for Wichita. Herman, if he don't show in two seconds, I'll have a scoop, all right. I'll have the first film ever taken from a camera used to club a man to death. It proves once and for all that there is a recognition of the sophisticated cultural and intellectual level of the Midwestern mind. And so without further ado, may I present to you Miss Rae Fey. Hooray. Knock it off, you bunch of yokels. Did you come out here to see a gorilla or what? Now where was I? Present Miss… Rae Fey. Move on. Who will in turn… Present to you the mighty King Kung Fu. Heavens, Myrtle. Myrtle. Eeeeiii. Oh. Naked animals. I have a hat. So, Jungle Jumper. Why is the house pet who learns early in life not to bite the hand which feeds. However. It is permissible to indulge oneself in harmless roughhouse and play. Well, fellas. What have we got here? A sissy gorilla. Huh? Anybody aware is a silly hat like that won't be any problem. Go get him, Pilgrim. Officer Pilgrim. Yes, sir. Good monkey. Nice monkey. Pilgrim. Well, how about that? Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Hii-ya. You still gotta answer to me, big fella. Bully. You're all bullies. Well, just a minute, little lady. Perhaps you ought identify yourself. You wouldn't be the new schoolmarm. No, I'm not. I'm just an innocent bystander. But I will not have you picking on this defenseless animal. Sure. Pity the poor criminal. But nobody ever thinks about his helpless victim. Oh. Come with me now. I won't let them hurt you. Don't be afraid. Once you're back in your cage, they won't be able to get at you. And so, Miss Rae Fey deserves a great deal of credit for her charms. Wow. Oh yes. Though the gorilla is now back in custody and being guarded 24 hours a day, his antics during his brief period of freedom astounded authorities. Well, he just pinched me. He pinched us too. You might say it was a pinched battle. In an attempt to learn how an ape could learn proficiency in the martial arts, somebody came up with the following interview. Clyde. How did the heck do you figure that little Dickens could lick them cops like that? (Speaking foreign language) I see. Thanks, buddy. Oh. This is been your reporter Bo Burgess. Wowee. I did it, Herman. I was on TV. How do I look? Was I good? I was great. Woo. Well, now the question is where do we go from here? What do you mean, Bo? You already got your scoop. Oh, that? Oh, that's just the beginning, Herman. That's the minor legs. Sure, the TV station liked it. Did I tell you they hired me as a stringer? You get the stories nobody else wants, below. That action today got me a job stringing. That proves the theory works. Get a scoop, get a job. But the job ain't much. That means I need a better scoop. Like what? The original idea is still a good one. Monster gorilla loose on the rampage. Grr. But somebody could get hurt, Bo. He knows Kung Fu. I'm not talking about hurting anybody. Besides that, it didn't look like he was too interested in rampaging when he was loose today. I guess that's true. But how many people know that? I mean, suppose we were to kidnap that scamp instead. You've lost me. We kidnap him and hide him. But make people think he escaped. Suspense builds up. Folks are scared to death for a day or two. Then intrepid news hounds that we are, we find him and turn him in. The town breathes a sigh of relief. Ships old King Kung Fu off to New York City. And we are the heroes. I get famous for my dramatic but accurate reporting. Walter Cronkite there can start looking for a job. Except. How do you kidnap a 500 pound gorilla? Huh? Shoot. Any ideas, Herman? Maybe I do have an idea, Bo. It seems crazy but I'm beginning to like this. What are you talking about, Herman? I just may know how to kidnap King Kung Fu. - How? - No. I want to think about it for a while. Besides, you're going to be late for your first official TV assignment. Oh, shoot. You're right. I guess we'll have to talk about it when I get back. Listen, do you have a camera I can take with me? When do you think that'll be, Bo? When I get back. Well, I'm covering the 4-H meeting. And not ought to be over by 7:30. Good. That'll give me plenty of time. For what? Thinking. Planning on how to kidnap King Kung Fu. Right, partner. You just think away. I'll see you later. Sure, Bo. Sure. I'll think about it. What are you thinking about? I'm sorry if I seem preoccupied. It's something I have to do. You mean you'll be leaving early? But I thought you said Bo would be at the 4-H all evening. That's right. That's the object. He doesn't know anything about us? Would it matter if he did? Well… It's time you realize that we don't need him. I've been playing the clown so I can use him all along. But now I'm taking action myself. - You mean…? - Yes. There's no need for this charade any longer. He's out of it. Once we have that gorilla, nothing can stop us. - Wait. - I'm sorry. But don't you have time for…? Perhaps. Later. How's sleep for the big ape? Not a peep since suppertime. Boy, they put away the bananas. Yeah, I know. Did you know they put soy sauce on them for him? You gotta be kidding. Why eat so many? Otherwise in a half-hour, he's hungry again. Aw, get out of here. If everything's quiet. I guess I will. Okay, Al. See you tomorrow. Hmm. Hmm. Grunt. Grunt. Grunt. Herman, buddy. You did it. Yeah. Herman. What, Bo? I said you did it again. You parked behind me. And I can't get out. Oh, I'm sorry. I was just - Oh that's okay. I know you're just thinking about your plans. Stay put. I'll move your car and leave this keys under the seat. I've got it all worked out now. And it's perfect. Great. We'll talk about it when I get back from the 4-H thing. See you later, buddy. I'm late. What do you want? I think we should talk. Well, I don't. Beat it or I'll call a cop. What do you think you're doing, man. Well, sir. I… Wooo. Achoo. Well, I guess I gotta let you see the little fart. It's his constitutional right. And I uphold the Constitution. Well, thank you, Capt. Duke. I don't suppose being a member of the left-wing liberal press, you think much of the Constitution. Huh? Oh, I've got it tattooed right here on my chest. Well, I gotta warn you. You show it to me and I'll have to arrest you for indecent exposure. Captain, can I talk to him now? Well, sure. But don't let him subvert you. He's one of them bleeding heart monkey lovers. What are you doing in here? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. I thought you were gonna wait for me. You don't know how much I wish I would have. Well, what did you do with the gorilla? It's what he did to me that counts. Well, forget that. Where is he? I have no idea. - What do you mean? - He escaped. He what? He just pulled the bars apart. Put me in there. Then he bent the bars back. And took off. He escaped? He really escaped. Wowee, this is my story the way it was meant to be. Look, us TV folks have all kinds of pull with the cops. I'll get you out of here and go hunt that jasper down. If it's all the same to you, Bo, I think else just stay here. Herman, the measure of a man's greatness is his courage in the face of adversity. If it's all the same to you, Bo, I think else just stay here. Okay. Okay, coward. Yellow belly. I'll face the ordeal alone. Have fun, Bo. Just don't come crawling out of the woodwork begging when I make the big time. - See you, Bo. - Okay. - Well, Herman. - Yeah, Bo. You take care, you hear? Sure, Bo. He could be hiding out anywhere in the city. How are we ever going to find him? Well, it's pure police procedure, Pilgrim. We'll just put out an APB on that APE. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Be on the lookout for a dark male simian. Want to be on a rampage for bananas. Considered dangerous. Be careful. He's armed and footed. Simian. Armed and footed. Captain, did you write this? Eeeeeeeei! I better make like a banana and split. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Be on the lookout for a male gorilla wearing a long shaggy coat, carrying bananas and needing a shave. Needing a shave? Are they out of their minds? Oh, no. A reverse mohawk. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Be on the lookout for a gorilla. Can be identified by heavy banana breath. Banana breath? Who's writing this stuff? Howdy. There's a gorilla loose. Don't cry. I'm still safe. These guys should learn to paint by the numbers. Extra. In the Wichita Eagle. Ape escape has Wichita agape! Calling all cars. Calling all cars. That's all the cars? It sure is quiet out there, Captain. To quiet if you ask me. Have you heard anything from the mobile units yet? No sir. Every place they go, he's already went. Gosh. What's wrong, Captain? Well, I'm afraid if we don't catch them pretty soon, the good citizens of this community are going to take the law into their own hands. You don't mean vigilantes, Captain? Vigilantes, Pilgrim. Thank you. Here. Those old ladies from Pennsylvania are always a pain in the neck. Welcome, buckaroos and buckarettes. To the Cow Town gunfighter show. You better grab onto a saddle and hang on tight. Because the show is going to be starting in just a few minutes. Ladies and gentlemen. The Cow Town gunfighters group will now present an old fashioned shootout for your entertainment and pleasure. Remember, Fred, we go on right after the shootout. Don't you kids worry or get scared because the boys are only using blanks. While our guns make a lot of noise, they won't hurt anyone. Our drama unfolds as the notorious Dalton gang rides into town. Wild Bill. Wild Bill. I know you're in there. Come on out, you chicken-thieving lily liver. You hear me, Wild Bill? I am asking for gunplay. Oh, Wild Bill. Yoo hoo. That's the wildest looking Wild Bill we ever had. The show must go on. Wild Bill, you're a cross-eyed snake. Wild Bill, I'm telling you to slap leather. Please. Oh, Wild Bill must be wearing one of those bulletproof vests. Boys, I think we best pistol-whip him a bit. Hey, what's Wild Bill doing over there? That ain't our Wild Bill, stupid. You're are our Wild Bill. Oh. Oh yeah. Go ahead. Make my day. Thank you. Who was that masked monkey anyhow? Hi-yo Silver, away. This is F. Lawrence LaRou with the news. And there's nothing in the news but King Kung Fu. The escaped gorilla has swept through the city this morning terrorizing all the populace in his wake. Here is a filmed interview with some of the populace who were terrorized. Howdy, remember me from that chat with Clyde Wong last night? Well, here I am again. And this here is Abner Gothic and his missus. They live on this farm here at the edge of town. Abner, how'd you happen to tangle with old King Kung Fu? We was terrorized. Yeah, I know that. But what happened? We were just standing here like this. He came riding by on a horse. My wife turned to me and said, look at that, Abner. I questioned which Abner she was referring to. As I am the only Abner I know. Yeah yeah. Then what? I too saw the gorilla. My wife turned to me once again and said, I am terrorized, Abner. A spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff had this comment from the Pentagon. When the panic stricken officials of Wichita finally decided they had better call in the Army, we responded calmly in the face of this latest emergency. One of the reasons for this is Wichita is quite a distance from Washington. Distance wise. And the gorilla can't get at us. Secondly, what with the red tape and all, it will take 2 to 3 weeks to mobilize a force to attack. Our advice to all of you whining civilians is to relax. The Army has things well in hand. As you can see, Wichita is located in the center of this great country of ours. And that means quite simply, we have him surrounded. Dr. Harris Freed of the Police Crime Control Computer Center explains his scientific methods of ape apprehension in this interview by - Hi, again. The doctor seems to think he's got it all worked out on how to catch old King Kung Fu. What's up, Doc? First, let me correct you, Mr. Burgess. I haven't got anything worked out. The crime control computer will do that for us. You see we calculate the strength of the average simian-type person - or gorilla if you will - who knows Karate and Kung Fu. Well, I never reckoned there was an average gorilla that knew Karate. We could estimate, for example, that such a beast would be capable of leaping tall buildings with a single bound or even demolishing them with a single chop. However, the computer will tell us his exact potential. And then tell us how to counteract it and bring him under submission. In other words, in a moment, we'll know what it takes to stop King Kung Fu. And here is the computer's answer. We are not supposed to lay a finger on him, men. Not that any of you have so far. What I mean is no bazookas and no machine guns. And not even old Ruby Begonia here. - Captain. - Yeah. Why don't we use that little weirdo? Huh? That guy Herman who kept showing up in the gorilla cage at the zoo. - Why couldn't we use him as bait? - Bait? To lure King Kung Fu into a trap. The court appointed psychiatrist says that Herman kept getting into that cage because he has an unconscious desire to be a gorilla himself. But I don't want to be a gorilla. Mr., you finally made it. Only you're not going to be a gorilla. You're going to be a gorillaesse. I figure if were ever going to track that critter, we got to do it with a female of his own kind. But I'm not a female of his own kind. I don't want him attracted to me. Look, you. The second that critter shows his ugly face, these officers here are gonna drop a net on him. Yeah. Well, what makes you think he'll come here? Elementary, my dear weirdo. I just got to figuring if I were a big dumb ape, where when I go? And I answered myself, well, to an amusement park. And now as a finale to the preview of this wonderful show we have inside for you, we are going to give you a free of charge peak at the one and only half-gorilla half-human. The lovely and talented Betty Lou. You better start dancing. Hey folks, wait wait. Wait. Hey wait. Wait. Go get him, Pilgrim. All right. Pilgrim. Let me handle this, flatfoot. So, you're the King Kong Fu they're all talking about, huh? You don't look so tough to me. Look everybody, the Chinese chimpanzee thinks he's a gorilla. Well, why don't you act like one and fight? Is that so? You have been fighting once again, Jungle Jumper. Ah so. It is hoped that wisdom will come with age. For then he will know that fighting in itself does not bring honor. As honor is all there is that separates man from the animals. If you truly wish to be separate from man and thus have honor, you must find only in self-defense. Or in defense of those who are weakest. Maybe this dumb soft monkey will come to the rescue if I slap around his honey a little. Hey. Looks like that did it. Okay, Gargantua. I'm going to show you what the words "strong" really means. Huh? Hey. Where's the gorilla? Hey, wow. Look at that. Come on. Come on come on. I've got it. I'm on it. If I know anything about animals, man, this will be easy. He's never been on a roller coaster before. This will make him dizzy and sick. When this thing stops, we'll be able to lead him away like a baby. Eeeeeeeeiii! Hi. Remember me? Grunt. Come on, men. He's getting away. Oh no. You better hurry before Capt. Duke gets here. Well, he got away again. But we anticipate an early arrest. In the meantime, we're advising the public to lock their doors and windows and hide under the bed. Thank you, Capt. Duke. And that's the scene of this, the most recent devastation of King Kung Fu. Incidentally, the hospital lists Bruce the great is more like Bruce the mediocre. This is another exclusive report by old Bo Burgess. That guy's getting more airtime lately than I am. Either he goes or I go. Maybe I'll be back with more news. After this word from our sponsor. Oh, you scared me. What are you doing here? Grunt. How did you find me? Oh. Come over here, Fu. Can I call you Fu? Sit down. I want you to tell me all about it. Well, I'm glad you squared yourself with the cops, anyway. Yeah, but what a way to have to do it. Listen, Bo. You've got to cut all this scare talk on TV. That gorilla doesn't mean to hurt anybody. Yeah, ask the circus strongman about that. Well, he started it. King Kung Fu was just trying to protect me. Well, even if you're right, we can't just let him run around loose. Well, who's idea was that in the first place? Yeah. I've been thinking about that. Success is great. But it ain't worth endangering folks. Especially folks like Rae Jean Fey. I just hope she'll believe me. I do believe you. But can't you see? Nobody else will. Just because you'd rather go out and look at people then have them come look at you won't convince them that you're harmless. They are afraid of you, Fu. I'm afraid, Herman. I got a funny feeling. You know, she didn't work tonight. She's home alone. Bo, this is a city of 400,000. How would he ever find her? Look her up in the phone book? Oh, I know it sounds dumb. But let's hurry. I'm starting to panic, Herman. I wish you would quit it. You're getting me going. I'm not afraid of him anymore. I don't think. But. He opened that door. And jumped out at us. Boo! Go! He's got her. Eeeyaa! Where is he? I'll save you. He's gone. You've terrified him. And he went out the patio door. Terrified? Look what you did to that door. Wow, Bo. I didn't know you knew Karate. Neither did I. It must be an instinctual talent. It must've been triggered when you thought he was hurting Rae. Were you really afraid for me? Oh, yeah. For me? I was just performing my civic duty and trying to save your life. Oh. I suppose you think it's your civic duty to scare everybody. You're terrible. You have the whole town hunting that poor beast. I'm terrible? He just wants to see the sites like any other tourist. But we've got to find him. And convince him to go back to the zoo before he gets hurt. Well, it won't do any good to hunt them down tonight. But if you think it'll work, we'll chase him down tomorrow and give it a try. Oh, thank you, Bo. Like a tourist. Imagine. A rubbernecking gorilla. Shoot. It don't figure. There ain't nothing in Wichita that unusual to look at. More than a town. Much more than a city. Wherever there's love, you feel Wichita. Wichita Wichita Wichita. It looks like a pitching change for the Elks. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's not a manager. I'm not an expert but I'd say that's a gorilla. Yes, folks. A gorilla. The gorilla kicks the ball out of the pitcher's hand. Is the pitcher hurt? He's favoring his hand. That monkey that got loose. Let's throw him out of here. This isn't football. They should get this gorilla out of here. Timeout has been called. It looks like… Yes… The batter is going after the gorilla. What a show of strength. Throwing the batter right into the dugout. Well, I never played the game. But this gorilla has obviously never seen one. The Elks' picture is hot. He's back. He's winding up. He's going to bean the gorilla. This is awful. Here comes the pitch. Oh, the gorilla swings. What a tremendous hit. Let me tell you, this kid's a natural. What? I've got something. Well? The second out at Lawrence Stadium, Oh, shoot. That's just a ballgame. Third out. Change it. Maybe you can get the news. Oh. The fourth out? - The fifth and sixth? - Huh? A beautiful day at the ballpark The score right now is Arrows, nothing. King Kung Fu, six. Make that seven. Wow. Let's go! The Arrows go after him. Oh, number 23 is down for the count. That stops everybody. What a show. The Barnum & Bailey Circus here at the ballpark. No one wants to challenge the gorilla now. What a competitor. Hey, what's the matter with you guys? The great American pastime baseball is being challenged by the great Chinese national pastime Karate. And it looks like gorilla warfare. Do we were run or do we fight? I'll flight. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've just been told this gorilla is the famous King Kung Fu. The Chinese gorilla. I thought it was the gorilla in Manila. Well, they're going at it, folks. Alphonso is trying. But this is awful. This fight should be stopped. Alfonso is over-matched. An incredible show of strength. Looks like aluminum bats next year, folks. He's got Alphonso by the seat-of-the-pants. It's a strike. Wrong sport, guy. Hey, let's go. Let's help Alfonso. Effortlessly, King Kung Fu uses his bats to fend off the somewhat timid Arrows, whose bats left something to be desired anyways. There's a toe jam. Oh, that's got to hurt. Listen to that crowd. Jones goes flying into the air. Smith follows the same routine. This gorilla truly is a monster master of the martial arts. Excuse me, Mr. Fu. Can I interrupt you for just a half a second? I'd kind of like to have your autograph. If you'll just sign here in the three places I've - You're wasting my time. I am a free-agent. Oh, another one of those, huh? Listen, don't try to hold out on me, rookie. You're just a dream kid that got a lucky hit. Haai. Haai. Over and out. Get the boys, Pilgrim. And let's mount up. Captain, the boys didn't make the roster today. Huh? Tweedledum and Tweedledee have an ingrown toenail. Egan got carsick while driving to work. And Wamba's mom called to say he's got a cold. Well, I guess that separates the men from the boys, Pilgrim. Looks like you and I are going to have to lasso that sidewinder alone. Ah, Captain, I've been having these dizzy spells. Pilgrim! Yes, sir. I'll get Nelly Belle saddled up, gassed up. And meet you in the garage. Yay, team. Yay, team. Rah rah rah. We one. Oh, with a single blow. King Kung Fu put the whole team down for the count. I'm telling it like it is. The sports world will never forget King Kung Fu. Where is he? He's inside. But hurry. He's murdering my whole team. Well, why ain't you in there helping? He don't need me. He's strong enough to do it by himself. How do you sleep at night, mister? Now you have nothing to worry about, my dear. There's a first time for everyone. And I'll be right by your side throughout the whole lesson. Gosh, Mr. Snead. Does this mean I flunk the course? Ohh. We're supposed to be in the middle of a high-speed chase, Pilgrim. But we ain't a moving very fast. All right. I'll take over. Nellie Belle's going to pull through, Captain. Since that wreck, something seems to have gone out of her. Don't you think you ought to say a few words, Captain? You were loyal to the last, Nellie Belle. Goodbye. Good luck. And may the good Lord take a liking to you. Somebody's gonna pay for this, Pilgrim. Yeah, mister. You are. This is a no parking zone. Uh. Little lady. Don't you little lady me, Buster. I'm a police person. Well, little police person. We're going to have to commandeer that kitty car. You try it and I'll wrap that little flunky of yours around your neck. Now none of your sweet talk. We got a job to do. Captain. Turn this thing around, Pilgrim. He went that away. Huh? I thought you were steering, Captain. Bo, look. Hey, stop, please. Stop! Stop! Please. Ape, you come back here. I got to stop him before he gets hurt. Herman, I'm going after her. Wait, Bo. You know him. He'll go around to the other side. Right. We'll catch him around back. Ohh. - Oh, Fu. Are you hurt? - Nuh-huh. You poor thing. Let me see. I guess it's all right. I don't see anything anyway. All right. Hold it right there, you two. Oh, Capt. Duke. Don't worry. He's calm down now. He promised to go back to the zoo. Haven't you, Fu? That'll be the day. Monkey. It's my duty to advise you that you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to the advice of legal counsel. That's ridiculous, Captain. Stop it. The law is the law. And I gotta take him in. I won't let you. Well, I admire women with spirit, little lady. But you're not gonna win this time. Pilgrim, get her out of here. Pilgrim! - Let go of me. - All come on. Please. I said let go of me. Help! I can't swim. Well, that does it. Now, lady, I'm ordering you to clear out. But don't you believe in supporting your local police? Hey! What's going on here? Rae! Come back here. Don't you know kidnapping is against the law? Are you okay, Captain? Will you tell me who's been playing baseball in the middle of the city? And now, senors, everything is ready. Hot shot. This is the niftiest publicity stunt in a month of Sundays. Aw, gee whiz. Piloting an advertising balloon across the city sure isn't as wild and wonderful as World War II. Keep your chin up, you big lug. We are making moolah out of this. Instead of feeling so low down, you are to be smiling, Jack. Ay, caramba! (excited Spanish) Oh, Miss. I'm sorry. But I really can't give you a ride in the balloon. Don't worry. I understand. I suppose all young girls would be attracted to a man such as myself. A breed apart. Rugged. Stalwart. Finding freedom in the skies. Laughing in the face of death. Bo, you've got to stop. We don't know how to fly this thing. - Take it slow, Bo. - But we got to find her, Herman. Look, Bo. I have to admit. You do know how to have a good time. Umm-hum. You have any idea where we are going? Nnn. Hey, come down here. What's wrong with this thing, Pilgrim? Well, Captain. I think we may be out of gas. Captain. This looks like a job for old Ruby begonia. But, Captain. You said - I'm not going to try to hit the occupants, Pilgrim. I just am gonna deflate that monkey's ego a little bit. Herman! They're going to crash! Hey! Help us! Oh my gosh. Oh, Fu. What do we do now? What are we going to do now? Yes. It's true. The monster monkey of the martial arts King Kung Fu has kidnapped Rae Fey. And is holding her hostage on top Wichita's tallest building. The Holiday Inn. Officials feel helpless at this point. Any attempt might endanger the life of the gorilla's beautiful victim. Capt. J.W. Duke of the police force made a direct appeal to the bull ape with a bullhorn. He asked that they quit fooling around and they come down. The captain has since left the scene. Here in a videotaped instant replay is Duke's parting comment. I shall return. Exactly what Capt. Duke's strategy is, no one knows. But he has vowed to see the beautiful girl safely rescued. And King Kung Fu placed behind bars. Incidentally, with our telephoto lens, you can plainly see the terror-stricken face of Rae Fey as she awaits her fate. Oh, there's Bo. And Herman's with him. Hi, Bo! Hi, Herman! I can't stand it, Herman. Look at her up there, struggling and calling for help. She's scared to death. It doesn't look that way to me, Bo. In fact, it looks like they are having fun. I wish I was up there. Well, if the police don't do something pretty quick, you are gonna be. We are both going to be. Yahoo. We're gonna get him this time, Captain. Well, you just pay attention to flying this thing, Pilgrim. I'm going to take care of that monkey with this tranquilizer grenade. Now make a pass so I can judge the range and distance. What are they trying to do, Bo? - I don't know. - Well, what are we gonna do? You're gonna have to get closer, Pilgrim. A-OK, Captain. A oh what? Closer. You gotta get closer, Pilgrim. Yes, sir. I'm going to get right up close, sir. Pilgrim. Pilgrim! Oh. Ohh! Fu, stop it. Let them go. Stop it, Fu. Fu! Let them go, Fu. Fu! That does it. I got to face him man to man - monkey. But Bo, if modern weaponry can't stop him… And all those people who fought him can't stop him… How are you going to stop him? Herman, everyone calls him the monster master of the martial arts, right? Yeah? But who's he thought? He's fought cops, cowboys and ballplayers, that's who. He hasn't fought anybody who knows anything about Karate or Kung Fu, right? Yeah. Well, last night at Rae's apartment, I think we discovered I've got me some talent in that direction, right? No. It's time for a one on one, Herman. Bo Burgess and King Kung Fu in a martial arts massacre. With me as the karator and him as the karatee. Fu, I'm getting hungry. Don't you think we ought to go down now? We've just received a report that one lone man is riding the elevator to the roof of the Holiday Inn having proclaimed that he will rescue the hostage and subdue the gorilla single-handedly Can you believe that? Get this. The man is that ignorant buffoon Bo what's his name who's been hogging all my newscasts lately. Boy, am I going to enjoy this. Bo, Herman. Get back, Rae. Herman. Get her out of here, Herman. Bo, what are you doing? - What is he doing? - He's saving you. - I think he's in love with you. - What? He's made up his mind. You can't stop him. Besides, I'm afraid of heights. Get back, Rae. Eeyaa. Whoa. Whoa. Yawn. Hey, kid. Your shoes untied. Hey, hold on. Wait a minute. I want action. Hey, wait a minute. I came up here to fight. Grunt. Whoa-oh. Ah, Jungle Jumper. As you have reached maturity in body and achieved proficiency in the arts of Karate and Kung Fu, you must heed carefully the words I now impart. Grunts. You must never ever revert to primitive urge of honorable ancestors. Such is the custom of the race of apes. That upon conquest of their enemies, they emit a cry of triumph. And be their fists upon their chests. For one such as yourself, Jungle Jumper, that behavior is a no-no. You may be big. But boy, are you dumb. Listen, klutz. It's this simple. If you start pounding your chest, you Karate yourself. You Karate yourself - Karate yourself - Karate yourself. What was that bump? Did I hit something? Oh, Bo, they saved him. He's safe. We caught him. We got King Kung Fu. You must still be dizzy, Pilgrim. He's up there and we're down here. He came to us, Captain. We caught him. Land, Captain. Land. But I don't know how to land it, Pilgrim. Bo, did you really come up here to rescue me? Well, I - Herman says you did. Herman says you love me. Herman says what? Where is he? Herman! When I catch you, I'm going to throw you off this roof too. Herman. Herman. Herm -- Bo, look. Grants. When you type up the report, don't forget to add sky jacking to the list of offenses, Pilgrim. I won't forget, Captain. Oh, Bo, he's leaving. He's flying off into the sunset. Yep. Well, aren't you afraid he'll get into more trouble? Well, he does a pretty good job of taking care of himself. Well, mama, the movie's finally finished. Did you get all the kids in, dad? Yep. Got all eight of them in. Cheap help, huh? I paid them. I paid them. Yeah, but it's still cheap help. Inexpensive, mama. Inexpensive. Look. There is a card without one of the kids. Well, too many cards. Not enough kids. First he kicks the left and then he kicks the right. Then he goes boogie with all of his might. Gives his partner a gorilla hug. And then proceeds to cut the rug. Remember when the feelings start to sag. You just got to do the gorilla rag. Shoo be do wop. Wop wop. Shoo be do wop. Wop wop. Shoo be do wop. Wop wop. First he kicks to the left. And then he kicks to the right. Then he goes boogie with all of his might. Gives his partner a gorilla hug. Then he proceeds to cut the rug. Remember when your feelings are starting to say. You just got to do the gorilla rag. Cuddle. Your buddies and friends are going to to go gawk and talk. They're going to say that's really the best. Then you can go down beating your chest. Remember when your feelings are starting to drag. You just got to do the gorilla rag. Shoo be do wop. Wop wop. Shoo be do wop. Wop wop. You just gotta do the gorilla rag.
