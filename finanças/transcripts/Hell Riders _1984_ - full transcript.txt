(upbeat country guitar music) (upbeat country guitar music) - Come on sweetheart, don't fail me now. Come on, just hold it together 'til the next town. Let's see here. We really are in the middle of nowhere. (upbeat country guitar music) Well, looks like colorful Ramsburg or nothing. Easy big fella, easy, easy, just a little further. Come on baby, you can do it. (up tempo drumbeat) Come on, baby. Come on baby, come on, come on, you can do it. (bikers shouting) - [Father] Repent or eternal damnation. - Come on, sweetheart, don't make mama walk. Oh my god. (anxious electronic music) Are you hurt? I was only trying to help. - Get outta my way, lady. - See what I told you, Rocky? Women ain't nothing but trouble. - You want trouble? I'll give you trouble, jerk bastard. - Shut up, bitch! (grunting) Who asked you? - You know, old Knives is gonna find out just how mean Snake really is. (cackling) Damn you, bitch. - Hey Convict, feisty one, ain't she? Hey, man! You'll take a beating, Rocky. Can't you see there's no one here making trouble except a woman? Just like always, man. - Hey, hey. hey- Snake's the only one that speaks for the Hell Riders. Any laws get broken, it's me they answer to. - Get a move on, Father, you gimp. We're gonna miss all the fun. - Bless you, my child. It's only fun when Snake makes his punishments on somebody else. - Maybe now it'll give the kid a good luck charm. Father gave up his fuck sticker. - What good luck charm? - I did a sinful thing and Snake judged me by the law. Cut off my hand for stealing. - You people are all crazy, all of ya. - We're the Hell Riders. Evil! (up tempo drumbeat) - Now we've got you, now we've got you. - Stop, you sons of bitches. (Claire screaming) - We've got you. - [Claire] Stop! - Snake. Ben, am I stupid? - No, no Big Ed, you're not stupid. - Murder on the road. We're the Hell Riders. - Letting these jerks ride along with us was stupid and I don't like being made to look stupid. - Snake, you and your Hell Riders better come onto the campsite so we can work this out. - Hey asshole, the Hell Riders go where I say they go. - I've had a gut full of you and your Hell Riders. You leave the civilians alone, do you understand? Ben, you see the lady gets out of here with no hassles. Snake, I'll see you back at the campsite. (Snake growling) (uptempo guitar music) (engines roaring) (engine revving) - Come on, start, start. - Look, it's flooding. Look, press down on the gas and let off real slow. No, no, no, no, hey, that's worse. Big Ed said no trouble. The lady leaves, hey, no crazy stuff. - Sure, we just want to help. - [Bikers] Yeah, we just want to help. - Jesus, start this car for me please. - Stop it, stop! - We're just helping her out. - Tell them to stop. Stop 'em. Do what I say. Damn you, faggot bastard. - Please start, come on, stop it, please someone make them get off. (bikers shouting) (Ben screaming) - [Biker] Come on, asshole. All right. Pray for his soul before he croaks. All right. Be praying that this young fellow, this young man will rot in the fires of hell. (screaming) (groaning) (tense rock music) (motorcycle engines rumbling) - Have my Cuban, mother fucker. (Snake laughing) (crickets chirping) - Spread it out, move it out. (upbeat country guitar music) - [Jim] Good morning, Dr. Dave. - Good morning, Sheriff. - [Jim] Did you get them blood tests back yet? - Oh yeah, the blood test is fine, Jim. Don't you think Joe is a little old for your Susan? - Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. Suzy will be as happy as a lark. All she needs is a hunk like Joe to keep her barefoot and pregnant. - Maybe she needs a little more than that. - Well one thing I'm dead sure of, Suzy and Joe are gonna produce a couple of fine young citizens for the future of Ramsburg. Send a little business your way, huh Doc? - See you later, Sheriff. - Doc, when you pass by Joe's Garage, ask him to join me at Iris'. (upbeat country guitar music) (mid tempo rock music) - Hey, Sheriff. - Good morning, Iris. Good morning, everybody. - Morning. - Sheriff. - Sheriff, notice nobody said good morning. - Good morning, Sheriff. - I guess Suzy's pretty excited about the wedding. - Personally, I'll be glad when this whole to-do is over. Where is Suzy? Is she late again? - Oh no, not Suzy. She and Harriet are over at Betsy's house. They're working out the details for the wedding. Anyway, I told 'em they could come in late today. The usual, Sheriff? - Sure, Iris. I'm ready to try it again. I figure if I keep ordering your breakfast special, you're bound to get it right one of these days. (sheriff cackling) - Come on, Sheriff, you're such a kid. - I don't see why I can't wear what I like. It's my sexiest dress, it ain't cheap either. - Well sure, Harriet, it looks fantastic but this is Suzy's wedding and the bride always has to be the most beautiful. This isn't the Miss America Pageant, you know. - Come on, we're gonna be late. - Suzy, you're so relaxed. I don't understand you. If this was my wedding this close, I'd be a nervous wreck. (relaxed guitar music) (patrons chattering) - Sheriff, is that Dr. Stanley back in his office yet? - What do you got, a new disease, Clyde? What was it last week, leprosy? - Daddy's worried about his heart. - Ah, you old hypochondriac. All's you need is a good piece of ass. Ain't that right, Ella? (women laughing) - Hello girls, get the uniforms on and get the show on the road. - Okay. - Iris, thanks for letting us take that extra time today. - Well hopefully you only get married once. You know, with the odds on divorce the way they are these days, who the hell knows? Come on, get going. (relaxed ensemble music) - Run, run, run. Hi Ella, hey Clyde. You wanted to see me, Sheriff? - When are you gonna start calling me Jim? We played together, didn't we? - Whatever you say, coach, you're calling the plays. Say, where's Suzy? - Hey boy, she's in the back room. She has something very important to tell you. You better get back there, pronto. -All right, yeah. - But the girls are changing in the back. - Shh, shh, shh. - [Joe] Suzy, you back here? - [Suzy] In a minute, Joe. - Suzy- - [Suzy] Yeah? Just a minute, Joe. - Suzy, you're gonna make me real happy fella. (up tempo country banjo music) My little pearl girl, my little pearl girl. Something makes me crazy about you. Can you feel my love for you growing? Suzy? Yeah, Suzy? - Joe, are you crazy? - [Joe] It's a mistake, it's a mistake. - I'm sure it is, you're an idiot! - It's a mistake, a mistake, I'm sorry. - Yeah, it's a mistake all right, it's my mistake. I've made a big mistake. - Suzy dear, now let me explain. - Leave me alone. - Come on. Wait a minute, wait for me. (laughing) - If you could've only seen the look on your face. It was good enough to land it on TV, hot damn. - I don't think Suzy appreciates Joe. I wouldn't treat him like an old shoe, I wouldn't. - Come here. - Get your hands off me. - Well wait a minute, let me explain. - Just forget it, Joe, just forget about everything. - Well wait a minute, wait a minute, Suzy. - Joe. Catch. It takes a football hero to get along with the girls. (sheriff cackling) - Suzy, wait up. (mid tempo rock music) (mid tempo rock music) (motorcycle engine revving) - Bless you, Angel. The sight of your divine body fills my mind with sinful, lustful, carnal thoughts. Praise the Lord. - What the hell's going on here? - This is my Angel. My guardian Angel, as long as I have her, no harm can come to me. - Nevermind that. What's taking Ben so long and where's that scum sucking Snake? - Ben spake and saith, "I go not to the mountain. "I go to the old mine." And Snake should wait here 'til he returns, praise the Lord. - Cut out the preacher bullshit and speak English. -All right, Snake knew you wanted us here at the campsite. So he told Stubby, me and Angel to come back here so you'd know he was coming. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, wait, wait. Ain't that right, Angel, huh, huh, see? (Big Ed sighs) - What's taking Snake so long? If he don't get back here pretty soon, there's gonna be hell to pay. (engines rumbling) (mid tempo rock music) You got anything to say for yourself before I kick the bunch of you out of here, Snake? - Hey. hey, hey, hey, Ed, Ed. We should pool our clubs. Together, we could ride forever. We could take over an entire town. We could ride to the very end, fight to the end. We could go out in a blaze of glory, a blaze of glory. Ed! - For fuck's sakes, you got a screw loose or something? Who you think you are, Adolf Hitler, Rommel and Bela Lugosi all rolled up into one shit-covered gob? Well? - Snake ain't the one to run the Hell Riders. I'm 10 times as tough. I'll fuckin' prove it. (groaning) - You stupid asshole, I don't believe you did that, shit. - Well I just did. - Damn you. Worthless fuck. - Don't say it. Don't say another word. - Hey- - Snake, you're crazy and stupid. I catch you screwing around my club again, I'm gonna have your fuckin' nuts for earrings. Now get outta my face! - [Snake] Why you dumb fuck, killing's too good for you? (thudding) - Nehemiah 4:14. "And I looked and rose up "and said unto the nobles and to "the leaders and the rulers of the people." - Go on. Get outta here. Go away, you yellow bastards. Burn in hell. Burn in hell! (engines rumbling) (grunting) - Fight for your homes, your wives, your family, the Hell Riders. ♪ For your... - Let's go back, Allen. I don't want to go to any jerky ghost town. - What's the matter, darling? Afraid you might find a little excitement for once? Well, look at that. (engines rumbling) - I knew it, pull it over, get it over. Get it out of the road, you putz. - I'm trying, I'm trying, it won't start. - Oh god. Oh god, we're gonna be raped. I know it, we're gonna be raped. (mid tempo rock music) - [Biker] Come on. (combatant growling) - Timeout. Peace. Love. Not hatred. (relaxed synthesized guitar music) ♪ I'll sail away for my lover to the grave ♪ Never meant to change - You wanna see something tough? (combatants grunting) That's tough. - Oh my god, let me off! - That's pussy. - That's a tough boy, huh, Vic. (combatants growling) (relaxed country guitar music) - Sounds like you need a good mechanic. I'm good, cheap too. Say, you all right, you need a doctor? - Probably, more than likely I need to talk to the police. - [Joe] Well Sheriff Bates' office is right down there on Main Street over on the right hand side. The sign says Jail. You sure you don't need a doctor? - First the Sheriff, then the doctor. Can you fix the car? - [Joe] Sure thing, let's take a look-see. - Thanks. - Sheriff. Excuse me, in case you're interested, I just saw your wife Alma, she just pulled up outside and I think she's headed for here. - The Queen B, huh? - Oh, come on. - And she wants to get me in some dang monkey suit for the wedding. - It's your daughter's wedding. - Not this fuck, Bobby, I'll be out at the Martin place. - I'll take care of this end. (relaxed country guitar music) - [Alma] Coward. - [Jim] Here we go. - Thanks. - Oh, I hate all this paperwork. I really do. - You know, I get the feeling, Sheriff, that you really don't want to do anything about this gang of bikers. - [Jim] Now look here lady, you told me yourself that this took place way out at Oak Meadows. Now, that's way out of my jurisdiction. - But I'm sure they killed a man. Well what about this, huh, what about it? - Now I look at it this way, Miss Delaney. This is a clean little town. People come here to visit and if they spend a little bit of money, everybody is happy. - I see. But if someone gets killed and someone gets beat up, then property values might slide, huh Sheriff? - Maybe. - Well what about your duty to the good citizens here and the law? - You're absolutely right, Miss Delaney, blackjack dealer from Las Vegas. You ain't a citizen of my town. As far as the law is concerned, by the looks of you, I'd say you were a $200 hooker rather than a dealer. Or am I wrong? (engines rumbling) (upbeat country guitar music) - Who I am, Sheriff, is only my business, got it? - You're absolutely right, Miss Delaney and it's my job to make sure that people like you move right through this town. You better have Doc Stanley take a look at that cut. And oh, Miss Delaney, I won't be seeing you when I get back, will I? - Have a nice afternoon, Sheriff. - You too, Miss Delaney. (upbeat country guitar music) - I'm going inside, Allen. - Here, how about a picture of you by the hitching rail with the church in the background? - When you're finished, I'll be inside, okay? - Some vacation, sheesh. - What was that smart remark, huh? - First, that bull-headed father of yours can't be bothered to wear a tuxedo and now my daughter, the bride says the groom is a jerk. What kind of a wedding is this going to be? - There's not gonna be any wedding. - I don't believe this, what have I been working my ass off all day-- - [Mark] Mom. - I just picked up all your china. - I've got to go to work. - That Doc Stanley ain't so hot. I'm feeling worse now than when I went in. - Daddy, all he did was talk to you a little. - Some doctor, no wonder he ended up here. - Hush, daddy. -Are you sure, Dr. Stanley? - You're pregnant, that's for sure. - I could just die. - Now wait a minute, I think I have a better idea. Why don't you talk to the father instead? - [Betsy] No, I can't, I just can't. - Betsy. A little human drama. - How do you do? - I see there's some more human drama. You'll be all right, come here, let me help you out. (engines rumbling) (up tempo drumbeat) (mid tempo rock music) - Well, the folks around here tell me they call you Dr. Dave. - Well that's mainly Sheriff Bates but it's beginning to catch on. - Well Dr. Dave, thanks for making me feel like a human being again. - [Dave] From what you said happened to you out there on the road, that could be a real shock to anybody. Why don't you just take it easy for awhile? - I will, after those crazy bikers and your not-so-charming Sheriff, I was beginning to feel like I was the one who was wrong, like it was my fault. What goes on around here? - It's exciting. I mean living in Ramsburg is like waiting for a patient to die, it's a little quiet. Quiet. (up tempo drumbeat) - Well what is that? - Oh boy, bikers. - [Alma] Sit down, Mark. (mid tempo rock music) -Allen. Get away from there. (tires screeching) - Oh my gosh, it's them. - The bikers. - It's the Hell Riders. - They're not crazy enough to try something here in town, are they? - Yes, they are. (bikers shouting) - Kick him, Stubby, kick him in the nuts. Come on, drop a leg. - [Biker] Get in there. Get in there. (bikers hooting) - It's all just a bunch of tramp bikers due for naught. - Get him up. - Make love, not war. - Well lookie there, that one's naked as a jaybird. - Oh yeah, let me see! - Sit down, Mark. - My figure's better than that. - Harriet, shame on you. - Let me see, mom. - But you're not going to see, drink your Coke and shh. Where is that father of yours? (bikers shouting) (hard rock music) (thudding) - Oh my god. They're gonna kill him. Allen, you fool. - It's okay, the bikers are off the street now. I think you better go see about your car. -All right, thanks for everything, Doctor. Maybe we'll meet again sometime when I'm feeling a little better. - I'd like that, Claire. - Me too. - Come on, let's go. You go take care of your car, I'll give the Sheriff some moral support. - Oh yeah, that dude could use some real moral support. I'll see you. - Yeah. (up tempo rock music) — Hi. — Hi. I'm afraid I got some bad news for you, ma'am. - Oh. - [Tourist Woman] I ordered you a turkey sandwich. You're not listening, Allen, what's-- - Now listen, I could serve you all faster if you'll be seated here at the counter. - Counter. - Here are the menus, unless you know what you want. - Maybe a burger. - [Bikers] Burger! (water splashing) - And a brew. - [Bikers] And a brew! - I know what you're thinking. What am I gonna do if these bikers get outta hand? Well that's easy, that's easy. I'll show you. (fingers snap) - Pig's ass. - A biker insults you, beat the living crap out of him. (Snake laughing) (thudding, grunting) (bikers hooting) - Pig's ass. - Very good, ma'am, very good. - Okay everybody, what do you do when a biker messes with your food? - [Mark] You hit him, you hit him, you hit him! (Mark laughing) - Hey- Hey- - Mark, come back here, get down. Get down at once, get down, get down at once, Mark! - Everyone has to choose between good and evil, lady. I made my choice, it's evil! Why don't you choose evil and have some fun? - Suppose some mean, evil bikers grabbed your old lady? (screaming) -Allen! Allen. - [Snake] I know what I'd do. - [Biker] You got a good one, baby. Come on man, come on man. - Hey. - Come on man. - You know, you look like my son, Timmy. Ah, Timmy is dead. - Let go of him, you bitch. - [Father] Please sisters, please. What about the 11th Commandment? Thou shalt not bring harm to the party. Pretty sisters. - The Hell Riders, forever on the road, forever on the road! (screaming) You got my attention, sweetie? What are you gonna do about it? — Bobby, Bobby. - Come on Bobby, now. - I know, shut up. - Stop. - Bobby, come on. (mid tempo rock music) - You ever see this trick before? Stop me. - You know, you're one sick pup. - [Snake] What's it to you? (Snake groans) Oh my god, I can't move my arm. - More like a gutter. - [Snake] Oh, it hurts, Jesus, it hurts. - You know, I think you need a doctor. Does it hurt? You do something for me, I'll make it well again. - Sure. - What? - Sure. - What? - Sure. - What? ' [Snake] Sure! (Snake screaming) - Get outta town. (engines rumbling) - That oil pump's not gonna be in 'til tomorrow morning. Looks like you're gonna have to spend the night, unless you can find somebody to come out and get you. - Someone come out and get me? No one's gonna come out and get me, is there a motel? - Since the motel closed, the Sheriff's been taking in all strangers. He thinks it's part of the job. Anyhow, you make that first right hand turnoff just after Chuck's place. - Good, is the car gonna be ready tomorrow? - You bet. - Thanks. - Sure. See you tomorrow. - Right. (relaxed ensemble music) (motorcycle engines rumbling) - You want to what? - I want to call off the wedding. - Out of the question. End of discussion. - But it's my life, it's not Joe's, it's not yours. It's nobody's but mine. - That must have been exciting, Mark. Some boys would have been afraid. - The bikers just came into town and took over everything. Everyone was fighting, even Mr. Clyde punched out someone. You should've been there, Dad, you should've been there. - I was busy, son. Besides, there's no problem, no harm done. Everything turned out all right, didn't it? No harm done. - No harm done for some of us. Mark was a brave boy, weren't you, Mark? - Yeah dad, we know how to handle those bad guys. - Right, son. - You really missed out on this one, Jim. - Yeah, if Dr. Dave hadn't been there, we'd all be goners. - Yeah, that Dr. Dave's quite a guy, isn't he? - Yeah. - Father. Where you get off reading that shit? - Judge not, lest ye be judged. - Don't worry, Father. Nobody's ever gonna judge Snake. Many have tried. - Oh no, my serpent, no man escapes the judgment of the Lord. Father, chapter one, verse one. - Father, you're full of shit. Nobody's ever gonna judge Snake, never. I don't need nothing or nobody, nobody's ever gonna beat me. I'm the leader of the Hell Riders and don't you forget it. - But what does it profit a man if he gains the Hell Riders and loses his everlasting soul? - Oh, a man of the cloth, Father, you're so righteous. You're so spiritual, such a follower of that Bible of yours. So behind that God of yours. - All things seem to work together for good to them that love the Lord, Romans 8:28. - I thought you men of God believe in forgiveness. You know, turn the other cheek and all that bullshit. - You want this one too? - [Snake] I really appreciate your loyalty, Father. It's nice to know you're on my side. - You know Snake, sometimes you're a real hero. (up tempo rock music) (engines rumbling) (clattering) - [Biker] Woo hoo. - Come on. - I can't. - Come on. - Honey hold on, I'm trying. (screaming) - No. No. No! (ominous electronic music) - Get off me. - What's he saying? - Get off. - He wants a shot of the car. - Not a problem, we'll let him showcase it. - Let's shake on it. (screaming) - Come on. - No. - I just want to talk to you, hold on. - No. Stop. - Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry, I just want to talk. I see you. Take it easy or take it hard. You don't have to wait for the first date, I'm gonna get to work. (screaming) - Stubby, his car looks a little shit. - Maybe the dude will show us how well it works. - [Convict] Maybe he will. (screaming) -Allen! Allen! - Stubby, this door don't close right. (Allen screaming) - Yeah, it's stuck or something. - Well what about the engine? — [Stubby] I think he said he wants to show us his engine, man. (screaming) - You bitch. You're all the same, you're all the same. - What did he say, man? - [Stubby] I think he said "Start the engine." - Woo hoo! (engine revving) Stubby, what did he say? - I think the man said "Close the hood." (thudding) (hooting) - You bitch, you're all the same, you're all the same! (ominous electronic music) (relaxed guitar music) - Claire, did you ever have to make a decision that you knew was gonna change the rest of your life? - You mean like when everybody wants you to do one thing and you know you want to do something else, be something else? - Yeah, pretty corny stuff, huh? - No, it isn't, it isn't Suzy, not at all. Be careful, people don't always make the right choices. - What is the right decision? - Only you can say, honey, only you can say. - Maybe things will look a little clearer in the morning. - Yeah, tomorrow everything will be better, I promise. You'll see. (relaxed country violin, guitar music) (engines rumbling) (up tempo rock music) (distant shouting) - [Snake] Fall in, you. Stop it. - By the Lord, stay clean, peace on earth-- - Stop that. - Aren't we all saved? - Stop it, stop it! Get your, hey, get back here, get back here! - [Knife] Hey, bitch. (screaming) (up tempo rock music) - Stop it, it's all your fault, it's all your fault. Stop it, stop it. - It's a betrayal! - Stop it! (bikers shouting) - Let go of me. - You wanna go? - I said no, let go of me. - You're pretty choosy for someone in your line of work, aren't you? - Oh, you know so much, you oughta be President, you know that? What's the matter, got something against Las Vegas hookers? - Jim. Jim, I saw the bikers out by the rocks. I think there's something wrong. - I'll get dressed, I want to go out there. - I'll wait at the truck. (anxious rock music) - You betrayed me. You betrayed me. And you. (groaning) - Now tell me about that station wagon before you get on your cycle and ride out of here. - Contact and study, admiring the tourist couple. - And don't come back. - You got a lot of charm, Sheriff. - I'm just doing my job, Dave. You may not like this but it is my job. - I don't like this, Snake. Angel's gone, she just took off. I lost my guardian Angel. She's gone. - Help me, Father, help me. Father, help me, help me. We're gonna make the whole town pay. We're gonna make the whole town pay. - Let's do it. - [Snake] We're gonna go out in a blaze of glory. - What? - A blaze of glory. A blaze of glory, a blaze of glory! - [Father] Let's do it, let's do it. (mid tempo rock music) (relaxed country banjo music) (biker blubbering) (biker cackling) - I've had enough kicks. - Come on, man. (old man grunting) - [Clyde] Hey, what are you doing here? (thud) - Suzy's taking my car in town to work. Won't you sit and wait awhile until she comes back at noon to pick me up? You can ride in with us. - Oh Alma, that's so sweet of you but I think I'll just pack up my clothes here and walk into town and pick up the car and get an early start. - Well, you're welcome back anytime, Claire. - Thanks Alma, you've really been nice, thanks so much. (up tempo country banjo, violin music) (engines rumbling) (up tempo drumbeat) - Oh my god, they're back, man your stations, girls. Lock the front door and get something to defend yourselves with. - Wake up, Bobby, we got big problems. - Sheriff. - Oh my god, Bobby? Are you killed? - Get us outta here. - What? What are you gonna do? Open up. (thudding) - Take the toy Sheriff and put him in his toy jail. (anxious up tempo drumbeat) - Put the whole town in jail! - Now I gotcha! (women screaming) It's time for you to pay for your sins. (anxious up tempo guitar music) - How'd you get him? - Oh, it was nothing. (thudding) - [Biker] Don't let her get away. Don't let her get away! - What a pretty dress. Very pretty... wedding dress. I don't like wedding dresses. I don't like wedding dress-- - [Mark] Hey, what are you doing? Mom, the biker woman is here. - Timmy, hey- Timmy. ' [Alma] Mark! - Come on, shit. - Let's get outta here. (Alma groaning) - What do you say, pretty girl? Where you sneaking off to? - You lay one hand on me, you son of a bitch and I'll kill you. - Kill me, you're gonna kill me? (screaming) (thudding) (biker groaning) (screaming) (up tempo drumbeat) - No. Let me go. - [Convict] It's crying time, honey. (screaming) - Get off me. Let me go, let go! Leave me alone! (screaming) (thudding, grunting) Leave me alone, no! (tense mid tempo rock music) (glass shattering) - Oh, thank God. (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) - Get back here, you stupid bitch. Bitch. Hey, hey! (screaming) - [Suzy] Get away from me! - That dame who slugged you, Snake, she's headed for the rocks. It's that dame who punched you. Broad's headed for the rocks. (engines rumbling) - The wages of sin are present, in, in. All right, ladies, let's go, come on, move it. Say your prayers, you're gonna need 'em, all of ya. And I don't mean hallelujah. - It's all lost, the whole town, everything. - No, it's not over yet, Sheriff. (engines roaring) (mid tempo rock music) (mid tempo rock music) (grunting) - I think that looks good. - Okay. (mid tempo rock music) (growling) -Ah, come on, Snake. (crashing) (engine rumbling) (mid tempo electronic rock music) - You already got 'em, Convict. - Yeah, both of 'em. Let's go check. - Hey man, she got away. - [Convict] Where is she? Snake, you could've killed me driving like that. - Nevermind, you dimwitted buffalo ass. It's not too late, now she hit the ground running that way. Now get going and cut her off. - There's someone alive in there, Stubby? - Man, don't even ask. - Now smack it around the bushes if he wants. I'm riding, let's get back to work. (Snake cackling) - [Snake] Now I've got you. Ha ha ha, now I've got you. (anxious electronic rock music) (Snake screaming) Help! Help. - What are you doing? - [Snake] Help! - It kinda looks like old Snake's just hanging around, don't it? - This isn't funny, I could be killed. - Killed? Kill Snake? - Come on, guys. You don't want to kill me. We're together, always. - We don't want to kill you, very much. - We want to kill you just enough. - One. (bikers chuckling) - Two. - [Snake] Come on. - Three. (bikers laughing) (Snake screaming) (thud) - Yee haw, woo! (up tempo electronic rock music) (ominous electronic music) - Easy now, easy. Go down a little lower. A little lower, that's it. (metallic clattering) Got it, grab a hold of that, yeah, under, you got it. A little further. - Do it. - Over to the left now, easy. - You can do it. - Go up a little bit.
