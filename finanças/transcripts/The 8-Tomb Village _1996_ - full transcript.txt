A FUJI TV KADOKAWA SHOTEN TOHO PRODUCTION The curse! The Eight Tombs curse! THE VILLAGE OF THE EIGHT TOMBS KOBE, 1949 Terada, did you hear the radio this morning? What? Your name is Tatsuya. Right? Yes... And your father's name was Torazo. Right? Right. You're the one. Somebody was looking for you over the radio. Me? I memorized his address. Can you go to see him? SUWA LAW OFFICE Was the name of your father Torazo Terada? Was the name of your father Torazo Terada? No, he was my step-father. My mother married him. I see. Have you known that for a long time? No. Since around the time that she died. When was that? When I was seven. You were drafted at the age of twenty one. Yes. Was your step-father killed in the air raid on Kobe? Yes, I lost all my relatives. How did you find the job at the Soap Factory? Through a friend. I see. Terada, would you mind taking off your shirt? Take it off? If you're the man we're looking for... you have a mark on your body that can identify you. Please. Thank you. You must feel embarrassed. You can get dressed. There is no doubt, he's Tatsuya. This is Mr. Ushimatsu Igawa. Your mother Chitsuko's father. Mom's... Your real name is Tajimi... Tatsuya Tajimi. The Tajimi family asked your grandfather to bring you to the Eight Tombs Village where you were born. Eight Tombs? It's been twenty six years. You look just like Tsuruko. I wanted to see you... Grandpa! He's dead. They questioned us as suspects many times. Yes. But it's over now. Yes. Thanks to a lady. Meet her. Miss Miyako Mori from Eight Tombs Village. Ushimatsu was poisoned a few hours before he died. He was suffering from asthma. A village doctor gave him medicine. One of the capsules contained poison. Then... It means the murderer is far away in the village. Police are also investigating this lead. Miss Miyako explained it to the police. I am sorry to hear about your grandfather. The Tajimi family sent me. Will you please come with me to the Village of the Eight Tombs? Yes. "To: Mr. Tatsuya Terada." Landlady! Who came with this letter? I found it in the mailbox. "Never come to the Eight Tombs Village. "If you do, a disaster will occur. "Oh, blood! Blood! "Another massacre will turn... "the village to a sea of blood." EIGHT TOMBS VILLAGE, OKAYAMA That's the Eight Tombs Village. So many things happened. You must be surprised. Honestly, yes. Welcome to the village. I'm glad you came. I always wanted to see my mother's village. I thought I had no kin. When I heard I have relatives, I wanted to see them. But... But what? Somebody doesn't welcome me here. Why do you say that? At my lodge... No, I imagined it. Forget it. After all, you're tense and nervous. If you're in trouble, let me help you then. Yes... That forest and the fields belong to the Tajimi family. A great estate. The Tajimi residence. The head of the village for four centuries. The twenty fifth master was Yozo Tajimi. He was your father. He died twenty-six years ago. His eldest son Hisaya succeeded him but he's been sick for years. So his grandaunts Kotake and Koume are taking care of the Tajimi family. They're twins. They've never been married. His sister, Haruyo, is your half-sister. She got a divorce and returned home. Yozo's brother, Yoji, was adopted by the Satomuras. He had two children, Shintaro and Noriko. Shintaro was a naval officer. The only doctor in the village is Yozo's brother. Kozen is the priest of the Maroo Temple. Miss Miyako Mori is back. I'm late. The police wanted to talk with me. Tough work. She's Miss Koume, your grandaunt. Beside her is Miss Kotake. You're mistaken, Miss Miyako. I'm Kotake. Miss Koume is beside me. I'm sorry! I always mix them up. This is Tatsuya, whom you've been waiting for. Kotake. Yes, Koume. What is it? Blood makes miracles. Indeed. His eyes, mouth... He looks exactly like Tsuruko. Tatsuya, welcome home. This is the home where you were born. Hisaya, he's your brother. He looks great, doesn't he? Sure. A rare, handsome boy in the house of Tajimi. Tatsuya... be nice to your family and they'll reciprocate. And... be careful. Don't let someone else take our estate. Some people must be sorry as their expectations didn't work out. Serves them right! Here's your medicine. Tatsuya. You must be tired, go to your room. You were born in the annex. It looks just as it did twenty-six years ago. Haruyo, show him the way. "The worst things are done with the best intentions" Let me introduce myself. My name is Haruyo. I'm Tatsuya. Such a big room only for me? The grandaunts' order must be obeyed without fail. It was their order to find you. Eh, why so suddenly? Brother Hisaya is very ill. I have heart disease too. If we die, the Tajimi heritage will end. So the grandaunts wanted you, who went away with your mother, to succeed your brother. Go back! Never come here again! How did you get in? Get out! You will cause only bloodshed. All the villagers say so. She's Nun Koicha. She's crazy. Don't pay her any mind. The Eight Tombs spirits are angry. Do you know why your grandfather had to die? He was the first sacrifice, followed by... two, three, four, five... eight deaths in all. Damn you! Go back! Stop! Stop! You try to kill me? Murderer! Where did you come from? What? Strangers bring nothing but trouble to us. Go back! I can't. I'm here on business... Get out, or I'll beat you up! Kichiro, no violence. Miss Noriko, why do you stop me? You're drunk during the day. Why don't you tend your cows? What's wrong with them? They were bellowing. That's a problem. Thanks for helping me. I lied. Did you arrive here this morning? Yes, I took a night train at Kobe and changed at Okayama. It stopped on the way and I slept at a station. I got the first train to Niimi and then took a bus. An hour's drive. Are there any inns here? Yes, but only one. Good, will you show me the way? It's a post office. Master Hisaya, here's breakfast. "Eight Tombs Shrine" Police. Tajimi's? Mu... murder? EIGHT TOMBS POST OFFICE Hello! Hello! How may I help you? Two postcards please. Ah, you want postcards? Just a minute. Where are they? Madam! Madam, you have a customer! He wants to buy two postcards. I'm sorry, I was doing the laundry. Okay, then. Ah, there they are... Two postcards, four yen. Thank you. It's tough to keep an inn and a post office at the same time. Keeping a post office is an honorable job, but selling postcards and stamps isn't profitable. Then also pay a little to the boss. Who is the boss? It's me. Your husband? He's in charge of the forest. I see... He takes care of felling and shipping trees. He went out early this morning. You take care of the inn alone? That's right. We have no kids and two empty rooms. Why not let travelers stay? By the way, do you have a ration ticket? Ah, I have some tickets instead. How long will you stay? Well, I don't know exactly... Terrible! Something terrible happened! Something terrible happened! Hisaya Tajimi is dead. Poor man! He was suffering from tuberculosis. No, he was poisoned! At Tajimi's house? Yes, they are in panic. Many cops are there. Tajimi's house, where is it? Go straight and you will reach the crossroads. Then turn to the North, then you will see... Who is he? He came here minutes ago. His name? Oh, I forgot! I didn't ask him to write it. Then... was it you who found the body? Yes... Your name? Oshima. He was already dead by that time. That means he took the drug before that. Who usually gives it to him? One of us. Which one of you spoke right now? The grandaunts gave it to him regularly. Except when he had a fit. That means... he took it by himself this time. I think so. Dr. Kuno? This is the drug the victim took. We can easily find out if it's poison. You compounded it, didn't you? You mean I poisoned him? Ushimatsu died in Kobe and we found out he was poisoned too. He also took the drug you gave him. Somebody exchanged my medicine for poison. It's a trap! Bando, how many packs are left? Seven. One of the eight packs contained poison. Lieutenant. Mr. Kindaichi is here. Kindaichi? He says he's a private investigator. Private investigator? Who sent you? A Kobe lawyer sent me here to investigate. You would be surprised, but... I was surprised... Keep away from the crime scene. I told you. I'm sorry. How careless! I'm busy. So you came from Kobe? I'm Tatsuya. Didn't you go out last night? Yes. Stay here until our investigation is over. You are? I'm Noriko Satomura. She's our cousin. She lives upstairs with her brother, Shintaro. Another man in the house? Get Shintaro down here. He's not in. Not in? He's working the field, I was with him a while ago. He must be questioned too. Tell him to report to me later. Bando, have the postmortem done quickly. We found this beside the body. What's this? It's a talisman from the Eight Tombs Shrine. An old one. The victim spat blood in the shape of the letter "eight." The talisman and the blood indicates the Eight Tombs curse... Nonsense! Send it to the lab. Lieutenant. What? My grandfather... Have you found out who poisoned Ushimatsu Igawa? We're busy, we'll find out later. You're Tatsuya? Yes. My name is Kosuke Kindaichi. To tell the truth, Mr. Suwa sent me. The lawyer? Yes. He thought your grandfather had another reason to look for you. There must be something we don't know about your birth. So he sent me here to find it. Didn't you find something unusual in this village? I think I did. Ah, already? Yes. As soon as I stepped in the village, I was attacked. That was my welcome. You start working earlier than the farmers. This field is full of limestone. There's a lime grotto underground. The land is no good for farming. Your father used to be a big landowner. But he lost his land under the new law. Meanwhile the Tajimi Family made money from their forests. I'm counting on my talent, not on my father's estate. I'll make my destiny with my own hands. Even the limestone can produce something profitable. How's your plan going? Not very well. I asked my friends for loans, but it's not easy. Brother... Hisaya was poisoned! He spewed blood... Is he dead? The cops came. "The massacre that happened 26 years ago..." I'm sorry, did I surprise you? Ah, excuse me. There is something like a cave over there. What's that? The entrance to a lime grotto. Ah, a lime grotto. This karstic ground is full of limestone. It's under the ground. I see. But there could be a cave-in. So you can't go in there. I see. Are you digging for yams? No, some roots. Roots? Yes, the ones called red roots. I make natural dyes. I'm looking for the right plants to do that with. Interesting, may I help you? Ah, it's Tatsuya. You know him? Yes, I do. Hello. Tatsuya, you know him? Let me introduce Mr. Kosuke Kindaichi. The Kobe lawyer sent him here. He's a private investigator. This is Miss Mori. It's you... I am Kindaichi. Call me Miyako. So you are the lawyer's friend. Not exactly, we just worked on a few cases together. Tatsuya, you shouldn't walk around alone. Where are you going? I wanted to have a look at the Eight Tombs Shrine. Me, too. Is it beyond the hill? Yes, but there's no building. Eh, why not? Lightning struck it many years ago. The villagers said it was the curse of the Amako remnants. Amako remnants? It's a legend told for centuries. Please, tell me the story. I don't know it well. It was in the age of civil wars. The Eight Samurai of Amako, who were defeated by Lord Mouri, fled to this village. The villagers felt sorry for them. They were friendly to each other at first. But Lord Mouri hunted for them. He threatened the villagers and offered a reward for killing them. The villagers were torn between two choices. The money blinded them, they attacked the samurai. Go! What are you doing? Don't let them escape! What happened? You trapped us? I curse you... This village will be cursed for seven generations! Try, if you can! As the last young samurai said, disasters followed the massacre. The villagers were terrified. They dug up the corpses and held a funeral for them. They built eight tombs and worshiped them as samurai gods. This is it. It's almost ruined. How terrible... So that is why the name of the village is Eight Tombs. The curse of the Eight Tombs... Tatsuya, is something wrong? When I came here... Nun Koicha shouted: "Fear the curse of the Eight Tombs!" Who's Nun Koicha? She lost her husband and son in a accident. So she became a nun. Tatsuya, you should forget it. She's just crazy. But she predicted the disaster. Hisaya's death? Yes, and my grandfather's. I feel they were killed because of me. You mean there will be more victims? She said eight will die. Don't worry. We have a private detective here. So no more victims. Thank you for coming to my brother's memorial ceremony. We horse dealers are invited too. Thank you. We'll be ready. I pity Hisaya. Bring more drinks. My husband's brother. This is Tatsuya. What a handsome man. Your grandaunts Koume and Kotake must be glad. Hisaya's days were numbered, but who could think of this? On one could, I pity him. The police will find the killer. Don't let it worry you. I'm the one to be pitied. The police say I killed Hisaya to grab Tajimi's estate. The villagers talk behind my back. Shintaro, let me introduce my half brother, Tatsuya. Hello! I live here with my sister like hangers. No, why hangers? Are you in the navy? Yes. I was drafted and went to the south. Were you a sailor? Yes, but no ship to get abroad at the end of the war. I miraculously survived the war. Was the man I sent to the post office a private investigator? Evidently, but who would hire such a stupid detective? You can't tell. Nobody can. Mr. Kindaichi. I dropped in to burn incense. Is that so? The stranger is here! Don't let him in! What are you saying? He's my guest. You can't reject him. I invited him. Ah, did you? Yes, come in Mr. Kindaichi. I don't like that Tatsuya guy. Accidents have happened since he was discovered. He's the heir to the Tajimi Family. You should watch your tongue. He can't shut me up. He almost killed the nun Koicha, right? Yes, so I heard. The village has been peaceful for twenty six years, right? That's right, the outsiders must leave. Detective. What cases have you solved? Well... none yet. Where do you live? Me? I have no fixed residence... What? No house? Ah, well... I'm a drifter... A drifter? I envy you. Nun Koicha. The party is over. You want some food? I'm here on business. Is there trouble? Koicha wanted to be invited tonight. She insisted on seeing Kotake and Koume. How impudent! Don't worry. I paid her off. My two aunts have the right to name the heir to the family. But they could have asked my opinion about the estate. That's why you're suspected. If I'm suspected because I'm a relative... why not then Shintaro? We're no saints. We all want money. We're concealing greed under a mask of innocence. Uncle Kuno, don't talk about it. My brother wouldn't like it. I'm not finished, listen to me! Hey! Does it work? Stairs! Wind! This is the exit. It's Shintaro. Did you know the nun Koicha lived here? No I didn't. Then what brought you here? Coincidence. Coincidence? You had a grudge against her, didn't you? You tried to kill her before. Some villagers saw you. They are wrong. The truth is, she tried to provoke Tatsuya. I was there myself and saw it. You weren't asked to speak up. The third murder? It's you. Not again! I didn't tell him. Don't blame him, Tatsuya called me. I thought Kindaichi should know. You can't do that. You're a suspect too. Excuse me. I'll ask you again, did you see someone at that time? No. Are you sure? Yes. Hey, Bando, are you finished yet? Are you Miss Miyako Mori? Yes. I have a few questions. You gave money to the victim last night, didn't you? Yes. Can you tell me why? She complained to me about the party. I paid her off. So you're the last person who spoke to the victim when she was alive. You can't be that sure about it. Somebody else might have met her after that. What's all this, is it miscellaneous? The nun Koicha had a habit of theft. It's her collection. It wasn't a serious crime. She stole a few coins from a shrine and rice from graves. Sometimes she stole the laundry from neighbors. The villagers knew about it. What is that? A sickle. Eh, it's beside the body! It looks like a crescent. It's the crest of the Amako Clan. Lieutenant, the talisman of the shrine, the Amako crest.... They indicate the curse of the eight Amako samurai. Not that nonsense again! Bando, hasn't the technician come? Lieutenant, look at this... It says, "Poison. Beware!" There's money inside. A medicine bottle. What's this? It's a scale to measure powdered drugs. I see... I've got it! The murderer is doctor Kuno. The nun Koicha had evidence from the two murder cases. So he killed her. It's you, Tatsuya. Where is Shintaro? He is out working the field. Through with the cops yet? Where did he go after the party last night? Somebody may ask you, but don't tell them. Why not? Because... Tatsuya. You came to see Noriko? Not really... We shouldn't befriend Shintaro and Noriko. Why not? Because the grandaunts dislike them. Why? Our father was the heir to the Tajimi family. His brother was adopted by the Satomuras. He was better as a man than as a father. The grandaunts who love the Tajimi Family, regretted it. The inferior naturally hate the superior. They still hate Uncle Yoji. Then why do his children Shintaro and Noriko live here? Because Hisaya insisted. The Satomuras were killed in Osaka by an air raid. Noriko, their daughter, was orphaned. Shintaro was at the front. No one knew if he would return alive. But I'm glad, because... you're back. Don't leave us again. What's wrong? Don't worry. It's my disease. I'll be all right. Shintaro Satomura. Noriko. Yozo Tajimi... dead. Tsuruko... dead. Hisaya... dead. Grandfather also... What is it? Oh, a family tree? Yes. Tajimi's family tree? Yes. Complicated, isn't it? Yes. Mine is simple. Hide and Tokunosuke. How many are you? Well... If it's too simple, you will be lonely. Yes. Care for a bite? Yes. Need help... No, thanks. Really? Sixty seven yen... You wanted me? Kotake? Yes, what do you want, Koume? Haruyo was talking with Tatsuya, wasn't she? Yes, she was. About what? Tatsuya is one of our family members. Don't tell him everything you know, how ignorant. To keep the prestige of our family, don't be too frank. Whatever I hide will be found out eventually. Don't talk back to us! You're just dead weight with a weak heart. I am just a sickly girl who doesn't know how the world works. But... Grandaunts. What? I'll just come out and say it. If I put up with your way of doing things, it's still possible Tatsuya could stand to gain from it. If he does, he might even go back to Kobe. Do you think you can say whatever you want and hide behind Tatsuya? All this family needs is a good man to sit as heir. Koume, couldn't we just have Haruyo leave this house? That's right, Kotake. Oh, you're here? There's something on my mind. What is it? It's about the murder of Nun Koicha. You... scared me. Miyako... are you involved somehow? No. If there's anything I can do for you, I want to help. Shintarou, limestone can be used to make both fertilizer and cement, right? Isn't this a little out of the blue? Limestone is mostly a formation of calcium carbonate, and the rest of it, the impurities, are silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, phosphorus pentoxide, and more. As for manufacturing, keeping those impurities under 20% of the content is the goal. Wow... you surprise me. I studied up on it. For you. Wait a second! I dyed white yarn and made it. Wear it. Three years after I came to live here, my husband fell ill and died. I was going to return to my home in Izumo... It was when you repatriated. If my sister hadn't been here... I would have started over on the scorched ground of Osaka. Hello. Ah, did I interrupt you? No. I'm leaving. Odd incidents happened one after the another. Did you come to ask me about the nun Koicha? No, it's not that. This is where you work. Beautiful colors. Is this ink from grass roots? Oops! It dyed my finger. It's from blue dayflowers. When you draw a design on the cloth, use the ink. Dye the design in color, then wash it and the ink will disappear. Watch. See? Yes, use this. It's true! As if you used a ink eraser. Convenient, isn't it? Well, I came here to ask some questions. Tell me something about the Tajimi family. I clarified the relationship. All the estate of the Tajimi family belonged to Hisaya. He had no wife or children. So his estate will go to his surviving legal relatives. If the killer wanted the estate, the fewer the relatives, the greater the returns. I'm not interested. I'm an outsider. I see... Tatsuya is illegitimate. Did his grandaunts already take legal procedures to make Tatsuya the heir? I don't know. I see. If they did, Tatsuya is in danger too. Oh no... I want to go see Tatsuya to make sure. Tatsuya, what's that? I'm leaving. Why? I caused this. Do your grandaunts and Haruyo know this? Not yet. Tatsuya, you're imagining things... Then... Then look at this! It came before I left Kobe. Let me see it. You wanted to tell me something at the pass. Was it about this letter? Let me see the envelope. Where was it? In the mailbox. Written using the left hand on cheap paper so the ink seeps. To camouflage the handwriting. The sentence sounds scary, but it's simple like kid stuff. I think whoever wrote this might be an intellectual. This isn't all. Eh, what else? I saw something odd last night. Where? Under the storehouse. This one. A tunnel. Why under the storehouse? A way of self protection against rioting farmers. This is a secret way out. I see, it leads to the lime grotto. This way. May I? This is not a doll. It's a real corpse. What... It is? A mummy. Mummy? A waxed corpse, to be exact. It's not dry... Some corpses don't rot when they are waxed. Food is served. It's still fresh. The Grandaunts must have served it. Grandaunts? The armor and helmet are old. A crescent herald. It's of the Amako Clan. But the corpse isn't four hundred years old. Who was the mummy? He was father to you and me. Haruyo. My father... You mean... Yozo Tajimi? Yes. Only the Grandaunts, brother Hisaya and me knew about this place. We kept it a secret. But now you know it. I'll tell you everything I know. Twenty six years ago... Where are you going in that outfit... Wait! Father killed our mother and ran out. Brother was thirteen years old, I was seven... A devil! Mr. Tajimi, what do you want? You're hiding her! Mr. Tajimi has gone mad! The curse! The Eight Tombs curse! Help! I'll kill you all! A devil! Help! I want Tsuruko back! My father... Yozo Tajimi killed thirty two people. May I ask you a question? Why is Yozo's corpse here? He was hunted by the police into the mountains. The Grandaunts hid him in the lime grotto. He died here. The Grandaunts covered his body with wax and the armor to hide it. I see. But why did he do such a thing? I know the reason. What was it? It's about Tatsuya's mother... Tsuruko. Haruyo. You better not tell. Not to Tatsuya. Yes, tell me! I have the right to know about my mother. I'll be back tomorrow! Tsuruko was the only daughter of Ushimatsu, the horse dealer. She was working for Senba at the post office. My father, though he had a wife, was crazy about Tsuruko. He suddenly kidnapped Tsuruko and locked her in a storage room. Tsuruko screamed for help every day, but he wouldn't let her go. The people around him tried to stop him. Her father asked him to release her. But he didn't listen. He beat Tsuruko. Finally she agreed to live with him... in the annex. The room I live in? Yes. Father was afraid Tsuruko might escape, so he locked the doors. He covered the windows too. We don't see them now. They lived together for months. Then a boy was born... he was named Tatsuya. But one day he suddenly... He grabbed the baby and branded him. Stop it! "At this rate, we'll be killed," Tsuruko thought so. She sneaked out of the house with Tatsuya. That's why Yozo went mad. Tatsuya! Why do you need to hire a girl? Because you're busy! Of course I'm busy. I mean, how do you plan to pay her? I'll manage! You always say so. But you only talk, never act. What? You will beat your wife? Why wife, so what? No, no, no... Calm down! Don't stop me, Kindaichi. I know what's on his mind. Yeah?! He wants young girls around! Stop! Nonsense! Young girls used to work here for the former owner. Former owners? It's an old story, forget it! Shut up! Hey, is doctor Kuno here? No... What's wrong? He's been missing since the night before. Mr. Kindaichi? Hi, Tatsuya. I found something weird. Weird? The screen in my room. I could see through it in back light. It's still light outside. Let's go! The cops are here. This screen. There's something hidden inside. Give me a cup of water. Yes. Tatsuya! Yes? Mr. Kindaichi, what's he doing? Nothing. I can help him. Can you? The spirits of the Amako remnants possessed the killer. They were eight. Thirty two people were killed twenty six years ago. 4 x 8 = 32. It has something to do with "eight." That means the Eight Tombs... Tatsuya! See you later. Ah, it's... "Yoichi Kamei, 27. Tsuruko Igawa, 20." "New Year's Day, 1922." Tsuruko... Your mother? "Yoichi Kamei." Who's this man? I don't know him. "1922." It was before you were born. Yes. Why did she hide this photo? Tatsuya... Tatsuya... Tatsuya. Grandaunt, what's happened? Koume has been kidnapped. What? Yozo... Yozo came back to life again. The corpse? It came down on her. Oh, no! Tatsuya, give me a flashlight! Ask somebody to take care of Kotake. I'll go to the cave. Somebody, help! This way. Mr. Kindaichi, I brought the Lieutenant. Haruyo's taking care of Kotake. He told me... So this corpse is twenty six years old. Koume's head was crushed. She was clubbed with an iron bar. No, the helmet fell on her. Why? The cobweb was removed. Somebody retied the cord and the helmet's tilted on the head. It looks heavy. Can you put it back on the head that quickly? There are footings, so it's possible. The killer hid behind the corpse and pushed it. I'll look around. He's a busy man. By the way... is it a dead end deep inside the cave? No way out? There's an exit near the nun Koicha's house. It's forbidden to enter the cave. I see. I've got it! Doctor Kuno knew about this cave. He used it to kill the nun. He pretended he left the village and hid here. Then he killed Koume here. Lieutenant! He wants you. This way. What? This way. What did you find? What is it? Look inside. Dr. Kuno! I can't believe it! The corpse is stiff. Two days since he died. What's all this? What's going on? Certainly it wasn't Dr. Kuno who killed Koume. I can see that! Rice balls! Three rice balls. One is half eaten. It's stiff. The killer lured him here and gave him poisoned food. But we found the corpse, and the killer had to change his plan. Why did he have to hide the doctor's body here? He wants us to suspect Dr. Kuno till he's finished his plan. You mean there will be more murders? I can't tell. Ushimatsu, Hisaya, Koicha the nun and it wasn't Dr. Kuno who killed Koume. We must start investigating all over again. Open up! We want Tatsuya! What is it? We don't want you, we want Tatsuya. His father killed my parents twenty-six years ago. No more curses on the village. Cool down, it's just superstition. You're living off Tajimi's cattle and forest. The house of Tajimi is 400 years old, but still powerful. Leave your complaints to me and then go home. AIOICHO, OKAYAMA SENBA CLOCKS AND WATCHES I came to ask you about this old photo. Mr. Mochizuki, the manager of Eight Tombs post office told me a Mr. Sakakibara ran it before him. Mr. Sakakibara moved to Okayama. I went to see him. Mr. Sakakibara said its former owner... Mr. Senba knew better than him about the post office. I walked miles to come here. I understand. I'm sorry, but Mr. Senba died during the war. I'm his son, Seijuro. Oh, his son. Don't be discouraged. As you see, all our clocks show exactly the same time. I see, so what? My father's principle was that clocks must be correct. I have the same principle. My father's other talent was a good memory. I inherited that talent, too. Tsuruko Igawa and Yoichi Kamei. I think I know the names. Eh, really? Wait a minute. The documents my father kept. Here it is. "Tsuruko Igawa, c/o Eight Tombs post office." There's a note. "Address missing." "Yoichi Kamei, 21st Regiment, 17th Division, Vladivostok." Kamei was a soldier. Tsuruko's letter to him got returned. But why didn't she use her home address on the letter? Why didn't my father deliver it to the woman named Tsuruko? It's not that he didn't deliver it. He couldn't. What? It's unsealed. Did my father read it? I'm looking for this man for Tsuruko's son. May I keep it? Who are you? A private investigator. Private investigator? Shintaro. Grandaunt, what's the matter? Where are you going? Leave me alone. Where to? The cave... What is it? Grandaunt... I'll apologize to Yozo. Because we killed Yozo. Sister Koume is there too. Don't go there. The cave is cursed. You said you killed Yozo? There was no other way. We hid Yozo in the cave. But he ran wild. So Koume and I poisoned his food... Poison! Yozo went mad because of the curse. The man who led the murder of the eight Amako remnants was... Shozaemon Tajimi, our ancestor. The curse fell on him. He suddenly ran wild and killed seven villagers. Then he cut off his own head. Ever since, the masters of the Tajimi family went mad. Every hundred years. It was in the 400th year that Yozo killed the villagers. Why do you want to talk with me? Come in. What do you want? I was going to return to Kobe. But I want to know the truth. You don't believe the legend of the curse on the Tajimi family? I'm already involved in the mystery. Surely you're one of the targets of the killer. And I'm another. You, too? Kindaichi! Did I startle you? Sorry. I'm surprised. Where have you been? I had to check on things. Why are you here? You think I found the nun Koicha's body first. Yes, didn't you? Only after somebody else did.... Shintaro. When you came here that night, she was dead. I saw you coming out of the house. Why were you here? Why didn't you tell the police? I see? But I don't have to explain it to you. I thought... you... Ah, something is gone from the altar. I remember an odd picture hanging here. The priest took it. Kozen? It was twenty-six years ago. Her husband and child were killed, she escaped here. So she became a nun. I see. What about the picture? She couldn't forget her grudge. She went crazy. She used to pray to that picture. Let me see it. Some poems are written on it. You can name the killer? No, not yet. Sister Koume, don't worry. I'm coming to see you. Help! Sister! Sister! Tatsuya... Hold on! I was strangled. Who did it? It was dark so I couldn't see. But I bit a finger of the killer. I bit it hard. Finger? Sister! Is it your heart? But I'm glad... I'm dying in your arms, Tatsuya. You're more than a brother. I love you. Sister! "The Eight Tombs Village Murders Investigation Headquarters" Seven people died! "The Eight Tombs Village Murders Investigation Headquarters" "The Eight Tombs Village Murders Investigation Headquarters" Ushimatsu, Hisaya, Koicha the nun, Kuno... Koume, Kotake and Haruyo. This... this is hell! The massacre that happened 26 years ago was horrible, these series of murders are more mysterious than ever. The Tajimi family brought us another splitting headache! Kindaichi, you been just sitting there. Why? You wanted us to gather, so we are here. Don't be silent, say something! If only I had found the clue a little earlier, I could have saved Kotake and Haruyo. I'm sorry. You mentioned a clue. Did you find it? So what is it? Tatsuya, do you have it? Yes. I found this on my desk. Let me see. "I have some important information about the killer. "Come to the samurai in armor. "If you tell others, the Eight Tombs massacre will spread." What's this? The killer is a little too hasty. Tatsuya received a warning in Kobe from the killer. A warning? The ink is blurred, I can't read. "...turn the village to a sea of blood." What's this? Give me some water. Yes. Water... This ink is special. Usually, water can't erase ink. But... look at this. It's erased. This ink is made from the sap of blue dayflowers. It's used in dyeing cloth with plants. The ink disappears when washed. Dye cloth with plants? This envelope has no stamp. It was delivered to Tatsuya personally. Two persons left the village and stayed out that day. My grandfather Ushimatsu and Miyako. Kindaichi... The killer... is it Miyako? Tatsuya? It's Kindaichi. Miyako Mori. You called Tatsuya out here to complete your murder plan. Murder plan? What do you mean? To kill Tatsuya. Why me? You used the curse of the Amako to make it look mysterious. You killed seven people. Even if you're a private eye, don't imagine things. You put the talisman beside the bodies. And the sickle that indicated Amako. Didn't you? Anyone could done it... Including you. You wanted to eliminate the heirs to the Tajimi estate. Ushimatsu first. It doesn't make any sense. Ushimatsu had nothing to do with the estate. Why him? You hoped his death would scare Tatsuya away. The warning letter, too. But they couldn't stop Tatsuya. Kotake and Koume were eager to keep the heritage. They wanted Hisaya to write a will so all the estate would go to Tatsuya. You killed Hisaya before he could write a will. I'm not related to the Tajimi family. Why should I risk my life? People risk their lives not only for money. Then what? Your finger's hurt. Haruyo bit it. She told so to Tatsuya. Miyako, as things are, the police will arrest Shintaro. Only Tatsuya and Shintaro are left as heirs. Shintaro will be the first suspect. Don't suspect him! Never! Miyako. Why did you do it? Sometimes the devil whispers into your ear. When Tatsuya was asked to come back, Miyako was possessed by the devil. Where did she get the poison? Dr. Kuno's clinic. Koicha the nun saw her steal it. "Poison" So she blackmailed you, right? I saw what you stole. I can turn you over to the police. Ushimatsu and Hisaya will be glad. Koicha the nun called me out to talk about Miyako. She said if I refused, Miyako would be in trouble. I was worried. That's why you went there. The nun was dead. I feared Miyako might be killed too. I kept it a secret. Kindaichi, how did you know Koicha the nun was blackmailing Miyako? This picture was there. The nun wrote a poem on it. Poem? Yes. This one. Well... "I saw the blue dayflower sneaking in the clinic. "She stole poison from the doctor's cupboard." What's this? She saw Miyako steal poison. She was unfortunate. She faked insanity and played tricks on villagers. This poem proves she was sane. So you tried to pin it on doctor Kuno, didn't you? Tell me! The police will get the warrant tomorrow. Hide here. Take this lunch. I'm sorry. I got you in trouble. Miyako... I don't understand why you killed the Grandaunts and Haruyo? Kotake and Koume might pick another man for the heir. I didn't intend to kill Haruyo, but she saw it. I'm sorry, Shintaro. Miyako. I... You've always been gentle. You're a good friend. But you never looked at my face. I wanted to cling to you many times. But there was an icy wall around you. And I couldn't step inside. I was sad. Very sad. But I didn't want a reward. I wanted... I just wanted to do something for you. That's all. And there was the chance, the devil whispered... "Shintaro could be the heir." I wanted to help him at this important time. Important time? He could have this land and build a limestone mill... You thought of that? It was my secret dream, it excited me to no end. I saw the flame of desire, dark, red, rusty... I was dragged in deeper. "I'll die too. Death will cleanse my sin." The thought blinded me. I couldn't see my sin. But... now I know it was a horrible nightmare. Finally it's over. I didn't know. I looked forward. I cared only for... myself. Miyako, I drove you to this. No! It was because of the curse on my blood. My existence dragged Miyako into the crime. I'm sure Miyako's last target was Tatsuya. But Yozo Tajimi wasn't Tatsuya's real father. I thought this man named Yoichi Kamei was involved. So I went to Okayama. I found this letter. Kamei was a schoolteacher. He was in love with Tsuruko. Kamei was drafted in January 1922. Tsuruko wrote this two months later. I'll read a part of it. "You gave me a baby before you left. "We will wait for you. "I'm expecting it in October." Tsuruko was kidnapped by Yozo after she mailed the letter. Yozo questioned Tsuruko after the baby was born. When Yozo got mad, Tsuruko ran away with Tatsuya. What happened to my father? He died in battle just before you were born. I see. Tsuruko thought this photo was more important than her life. Oh, no! No! There was still poison left? Miyako! Mi... Eight tombs for the samurai. Eight victims this time. Miyako chose herself as the eight victim. Tatsuya, you and I aren't cousins. Come to Kobe with me. We will move to Osaka. Eh, Shintaro too? We aren't interested in the Tajimi estate. My brother is proud. And Mr. Kindaichi... where will he go? He's a drifter. I can never forget him. I checked on Miyako Mori, she came from Izumo. It's the home of the Amako clan. She wanted to avenge them. Nonsense, you're imagining things again. Bando, get me some water! The Tajimi heirs dropped their expectations. Will the estate belong to the village now? Who knows? Is Kindaichi staying? He will leave today. Will you see him off? Of course! A money order for you from Mr. Suwa, the lawyer in Kobe. Shall I cash it? Yes please, it's convenient to live in a post office. In two sheets. Mr. Kindaichi, will you sign it? Payment of fee and expenses. I told him everything was settled, so he sent the money. What, it's more than what I told him. I must return the extra. You're honest. Mr. Kindaichi, you did a great job. Keep it. No, business is business. Ah, time for the bus. I'll get my bag. Mr. Kindaichi? What's that? Bean paste, a souvenir. Stupid! Kindaichi wouldn't like it. What are you saying? He loves my bean paste soup. I've prepared a nice souvenir for Kindaichi. What? His clogs are worn out. I'll give him new clogs. What shall I do with this then? Hello! Hello! Customer? Postcards? Two stamps. Stamps. Here they are. Two stamps. Starring: ETSUSHI TOYOKAWA YUKO ASANO Story by SEISHI YOKOMIZO Directed by KON ICHIKAWA
