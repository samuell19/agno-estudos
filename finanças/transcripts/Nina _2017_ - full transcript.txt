A film by Juraj Lehotsky Go, go, Nina! Let's go, Nina! Go, go, go! That's it! Just a few more strokes! Fantastic! Fantastic! Great job! You're the best! Congratulations, darling! Are you cold? Exhausted? I've won two golds and one bronze. Now I want a silver. - But just one. And then another gold. - Who's the guy with the bike? Mom's friend from work. Does he come here often? I don't know. - I'll give you a hand. Where do you want that tree? - By the river. - I'm going to need more. - Pellets? Why do you work so late? Someone's got to bring in the money. Thanks. - See you. - See you. - Bye, darling. - Bye. So, did you celebrate? Did he get you a present? Last year you also sang. - What did we sing? - Happy Birthday to You. Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday, dear Nina, Happy Birthday to you! What did Dad get you? Caterpillars. Caterpillars? He just gave you caterpillars? And a phone. Mom, Klobucnik has made it to the Olympics. Okay, so I'll send it to you later. Wait, you need it now? Okay, I'll just send it now. What? You need it for accounting, I see. Okay, good. Bye! Why are you speaking German? I can't understand you. That's why you should learn it. I don't like the sound of it. I'm fine with English. You'll have to take the bus to school today. I have some work to do. First class got canceled. Our math teacher is sick. Have you said you prayers yet? Come on, put the phone away. Bless us, Lord, and these Thy gifts, which we receive from Thy bounty. Dad, can you bring my armbands? Try swimming by yourself. Come on, kick, kick! Swim to Mommy. - I saw a fish down there! - How many did you see? - Just one, I think. - There's got to be more! - Hurry up, it's almost 8:30. - Are you coming home this evening? I'm not coming anymore. You'll be spending one week at Mom's and the other at mine. You're never coming home again? - Go on, then. Bye! - Bye! Sorry I'm late. Girls! Quit playing about and practice! Autumn rain is pouring down, Washing off dear Nina's frown, Such a day calls for a hike, Dino scurries to his bike, Off the bike goes, picks up pace, Hits dear Nina in the face. - She was with you and didn't go to school. - I did go to school. I was just late. What did she need pellets for? - It's not Dad's fault! - Be quiet! I'm talking to your father! Oh, and by the way, you didn't have to take my stereo. If you keep this up, your swimming days are over! Like hell they are! You're not the boss of me. Dad! Dad! Left controls the scoop, right turns the crane. Come on, let's scoop up the moon. Mom, will you come to school to dance? We're having career week. Lukas's father came yesterday. He's a conductor. You know I don't dance anymore. So what? You're still good at it. Talk to your father. - Stop it! - What's all this moping? Don't go moping around now! You wake me up early and now you're moping? - "Haraburda". - That's a funny word. What does it mean? It's junk. Something that's no longer of any use. Nina, what're you going to do with it? She's always bringing something home. My little hoarder. Nina, aren't you going to help us? - So I'll be at Dad's until Friday? - Saturday. I told you already. - Sir, maybe there's another one? - I don't know! That's not my problem! - I know, but... - You ought to get this place in order. - Sir, there's no need to be rude. - Am I the clerk here or are you? - Okay then, let's see... - Here, Mom, I'll read it out for you. Four, zero, zero, eight, one, seven, seven, zero, seven, two, eight, two, six. Thanks a lot, darling! 28 Euros, please. - Thank you, goodbye! - Goodbye! I want to get a divorce. I just want it to be over. We could go away for a while. We could take Nina. We could go to the mountains, all three of us. - Yeah, sure. - All right, great. I want to be with you today. Mom, tomorrow I have to pay the course fees. Nina, you're supposed to be in bed. There's also the payment for last month. - Have you told Dad? - Yes. He said to tell you. - What's up? - It's nothing. Nina, I'm not dealing with this now. Please, just go to bed. Where I can't get in your way... It's okay. Don't worry about it. We'll sell the house. I've decided. We'll split the money and that'll be it. - Where are you going to go? - I don't know. "At least you'll see what it's like spending a week away from your kid." That's what he always says, that bastard! Let him have her if that's what he wants. He'll see... Can't you just talk it out? Hi. - What's new at home? - Nothing. Nothing for the whole week? I want you to come to school. Talk about the crane. - We're having career week. - Forget it, darling. What am I going to say? How I climb up and down? - I already signed you up. - Jo reggelt. Bonjour. Guten Morgen. - What's this? - I found that for you. - What am I going to do with it? - We can use it to make tea. If we can get the bottom. Come here, silly. Of course we'll get the bottom. Did the Austrian film this? - Where is it? - It's on your nose. - Has he moved in yet? - Yesterday he came to visit. So what's he like? I can't understand him. I dreamt we were in your crane. We tried to scoop up the moon. - Where is it? - It's right here… I want the walls painted blue, Dad. - Here, but it's going to be too big. - Thanks. - Done? - There, you're all set. Mind your kicks. Now pick up the pace. Keep your elbows high and push! Less breathing. Speed up! Speed up! Great, two seconds faster than last time. Take two more laps. I was waiting for you. You were supposed to bring my gear. The coach has picked me for the race. I made third place in time trials. - Are you happy? - Of course! We'll be in the big pool. Here are the checks. Bring back the receipt. Take this to Mom. Let's go. I have the girl now. Let him do it himself. Nina, the bus is here. But why me? All right, I'll call you later. Yes, I've done my homework. - I left my swim gear at home. - Send me a picture of your room. I will. What do you have in there? A bed, some flowers, a TV... a chest of drawers, a couch... It's quite nice. You got somewhere to do your homework? Are you there? - Dad said you should pay those checks. - Nina, We've talked about this. No swimming until you've improved your grades. I'm looking forward to seeing you. We'll go to the mountains for the weekend. You should go to bed now. Bye! I need to run an errand. Dad, I'm sick. You fake. I don't want to go to school. I don't know anything. It's too hard. Show me, what is it? Dividing decimals with a remainder. What's that about? I don't get it. How do you do it? How should I know? Aren't the solutions in the back? You're late for work. - I have the girl, can't you see? - She has no business here. Mind your own business. Nina, let's go. - Where does all the ore go? - We load it off the ship, it goes to Austria, where they smelt it and make iron from it. Why is it shaped like pellets? I don't know. I didn't make it like that. - Put the bicycle down! - There's the old miser... I told you to put it down! Put it down! When are you going to give me back my money? I'm not giving you anything. You fucked up my bicycle. What're you doing up there? Get down here this instant! - Why weren't you at school? - I was feeling sick. What happened to your hair? - Did you cut her hair? - She cut it herself. - Why did you let her? - Excuse me? - Why did you let her? - It was her decision. - Go get your things. We're leaving. - Where? To the mountains. Get! - What're you doing? Are you insane? - She's with me until Saturday. - You prick, you locked in your own kid? - I didn't make the rules. And if I'm a prick, then you're a cunt. - Wait, are you serious? - It would appear so. Where are you going? Give me the key or open the door! - I'm working. - What do you mean, you're working? Can't you see? Have you lost your fucking mind? Just open the door! Fucking idiot! Miro, come down here! Get down here, come on! What have you done? Clean this up, you hear? You hear me? "Prick... cunt..." That's all you ever do. - What did you say? - Nothing. You only insult each other. Get your things and scram! - Don't touch that! - Have you lost your mind? I'll get 70 Euros for that. That'll cover my practice fees. You cut off your hair for a handful of change? Pack up your things. I'm taking you to your mother's. - Here's the keys. Just go, man, hurry. - I'll be right back. Hope you have a nice trip to the mountains. And remember to tell Mom that we were miserable. Call her. Tell her I'm driving you home. Are you listening? Yes? Hi, Mom. Dad's driving me home. - But we're at the cinema. - They're at the cinema. Well, tell her to go home. - Dad says you should go home. - Let me talk to him. - She wants to speak with you. - Why? Just tell her to go home! - He says, go home. - Put me on speakerphone. - Hello? Can you hear me? - She wants to speak with you. Why are you doing this to me? Is this like revenge? First you lock her in a shed, now you're driving her home. Can't you be an adult for once? Just get off my back. You're nothing but a... You know what, I'll tell you in court. We're through. Today was the last time you saw her. Put Nina back on. Dad! Nina, you cracked your ribs. You need to take a break from swimming. Let's go home. I brought Nina's things. - May I speak with her? - They're not home. - But the car's right here... - Helena doesn't want you coming here. - I can't understand you. - Helena doesn't want you around. He brought Nina's stuff. Next time you can tell him yourself. He could've killed her. I don't want him coming here again. Where are you going to move? Some two-bedroom apartment. - Are you going to the race? - I can't. The doctor forbids it. - What's that? - A carnivorous tree. You can have it if you want. Is that your new dad? You should go. Nina, come help us! Hey! I came, like you asked. Too late. How much can the crane carry? 16 tons. How many times a day do you climb up and down? Some ten, twelve times? I'm not sure. Don't you sometimes fear that you'll fall down? No. Where do you go to pee? There's a bucket... - Do you enjoy your work? - Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. And what do you do when you don't? - I sing to myself. - Will you sing for us? - Well, should I? - Yes. I confess to almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned, in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and what I have failed to do, through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault; therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin, all the Angels and Saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me and to the Lord our God. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. May Klobucnik win at the Olympics, may we get a different math teacher, and may my parents no longer fight. And may they love each other. You said you would come with us... - At least pack up your things. - Okay. And the race has started! World champion Daniel Gyurta... - Go, go! - …Is certainly a strong favorite. And indeed, he is currently in the lead, but Tomas Klobucnik is not too far behind with a great time of 12.31 seconds at the turn. As you can see yourselves, this a very tight race... Slovenian Damir Dugonjic is slowly catching up. Our athlete is currently in third place. Keep it up, Tomas! - Yes! A beautiful third place for Tomas Klobucnik! Our athlete confirms great form! Here's the money you asked. Here's the change. You know you're not allowed to swim. - Tell your parents I want to see them. - But I'm okay. Didn't you hear me? - But coach... - I don't want to hear it. Let's go, kids! Let's move it! Valisova, what're you doing? You're supposed to be racing tomorrow! So you're not injured? Okay then, get in there. 25 metres, but give it your all. Valkova, what're you doing? Move it! Are you hurting? Tomorrow I want to see your parents. - Closer, come on. - Where? A bit to the side. - Okay, now. - All right, let's see. Get it, get it, get it! Come on, pick it up! I almost had it! - What're you doing here? - The race is tomorrow. Does Mom know you're here? - Nina... - Dad, please take me! - I'm driving you home. You'll get me in trouble. - Dad don't call her. - I'm fine! The coach has allowed it. - Talk to your mother. Nina... Where are you going? Have you lost your mind? I'm all right. I want to swim. You could've drowned. Put on the blanket. You'll get a cold. Remember when Mom was sick? We wrapped her up in a blanket. You cooked for me, and I made tea for Mom. - How'd that cross your mind? - I don't know... NINA'S WITH ME. SHE'S OKAY. I set them free. Are you mad? Did Mom like them? She said they'd only live two weeks. This is great. Just look at those wings. Here's something for good luck! - It's nice. You made it yourself? - Yeah. It's from your World. Thanks. Should I swim with this? - Of course! - You're silly. I've got to go. Bye! Wait, give me your hand. For good luck. Dad, film it. - Nina come here! Get away from there. - Leave me alone! I'm fine! - You can't swim. The doctor said so. - Mom, I'm fine. What do you mean, you're fine? She can't swim. Nina come here! - Mom, stop it! I want to swim! - Go get dressed, you're coming with me! Get your things and let's go! Nina! - Let go of her or I'm calling the police. - Why don't you leave her alone? She was okay to swim! You want to call the police? Suit yourself. - Nina... - Let go of her! Go on, go swim. Go! This was the last time you saw her, you prick. Nina, let's go! Stop crying! I said, stop crying! Your swimming days are over. You lied to me, Nina! - You're awful. I hate you! - You just ran away! You knew he'd take you! - But I'm fine! - You're fine? You can tell that to your father! Oh, cut it out, would you? Everyone saw what happened there! It was so embarrassing. You're terrible to each other. All you ever do is fight. Like a couple of losers. You think you might have something to do with that? Where are you going? Nina, stop! Get back here this instant! Hey, Lara. Did you run away, too? Wait, wait, it's me... What? What do you mean, she ran away? Where did it happen? I'm on my way. Lara! - Lara! - Hey, is this your dog? Where'd this bastard come from? Miso, get rid of it! Fucking mongrel... Throw it in the river. You'll end up in Budapest, you little bitch. - Age? - Eleven, almost twelve. - Hair? - Blonde. And short. Short blonde hair... What was she wearing this morning? I wasn't with her in the morning. She was wearing a red jacket with white stripes. Okay, red jacket... white stripes... 24 hours? I'd like to see what he'd do if she were his daughter. Calm down. She'll show up. Remember the party? She just stormed off, then we found her hiding in that tree. - This is completely different. - You know how she can be. She spent half the day moping and then came back in the evening. Please, if she comes home, just call me immediately. No, don't go anywhere. Just stay at home, please. Thanks. - Get away from there. Come here! - I want to swim! Leave me alone. Please! - I'm fine. - What do you mean, you're fine? I want to swim! I'm fine. Just let me swim! Please! Get your things and let's go! Nina! Dad, film it. I want to show mom. Dad, film it. I want to show mom. - Get away from there! - I want to swim, Mom. Please! - You can't swim, the doctor said so. - I'm fine. Just leave me alone, I'm fine! I want to swim! Please, just tell me what happened to my daughter. What happened? What happened? We found her things scattered about on the rocks. We just sent two officers and a dog down to the bridge. We'll see if they find anything. We'll call the divers in the morning. Go farther, all the way to the second bridge. Come here. It's my fault that she came here. Let's go, Madam, this is no use. Come, you'll sit in the car and rest. - No, I can't... - You need to sit down and relax. - No, I'll go with them. - Madam, I can't allow that. I'll just sit here and go with you. - Madam, you can't go with us. - Please, let me go. I have to do this. - Come back here, please. - No. I'm begging you. We're below the bridge. We'll go check by the embankment. Okay, take her with you. Hold on, slow down... Okay, let's go. Go to the pontoons and search the cove. We haven't found anything. We're wrapping up here, okay? Jano, steer over to the pillars, I think I see something. Let's get closer to those stairs. A little closer... More to the right. There's something beneath the plastic. It's just a dead dog. Dad, I want to go home.
