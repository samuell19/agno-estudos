30 degrees plus expected today. In fact, we could beat the record. which stands as the 12th of June this year. We've got 32. We could even make it to 33 degrees today. And, of course, it's the persistence of that heat wave. It's no rest. No let-up tonight... 15 degrees, minimum 15 degrees. One or two cities could well head into the 20s overnight... ...and that is really, really hot, thereby triggering health warnings. How long is this going to last for? Well, we've got the breakdown all the way tomorrow... Look to the right. Look up. That was very good, Danny. You're keeping well, are you? Yes, thanks. I must say, you're looking well. Good. Thank you. Surviving this heat, eh? Just about. It's pretty scorching, isn't it? Yes, it is. O-O-o... Kay. So, fire away. The giving of a band. ...signifies the promise of a love that is everlasting... ...and is a public affirmation. ...that the contract between Will and Gavin will be honored. Will. This ring is a token of my abiding love. And a sign of the promise I make to you today. The bishop can be a bit of a prick when it comes to poofs. And as for old Worzel down at Lambeth Palace... ...she's got her knickers in a right twist. - Would you like a top-up, sir? - Oh, how kind! How do you stand the strain? I may be a rampant old sodomite, my darling... ...but I still believe that Jesus wants me for a sunbeam. - Oh, waiter. - Sir? Bring us a few more of those lovely sausages, would you? Of course. And so then we go back to where we were at the start. with that guy in the truck... ...and we realize that Chris has said "fuck off" to the lot of them. ...and decided to make a new start in London. And, um... Well, that's about it. Uh, you see, Robin, the thing is, um... - You know I'm a great fan, don't you? - Oh, you don't like it. - I mean, you do know that, don't you? - You don't, do you? I just feel we've been there before. No, we haven't. I mean, the whole gay thing. - Is it an issue anymore? - It is if you're gay. That's why you have to ask yourself, "Is it still an issue?" And anyway, this is more than that... Because I don't think it is. You know, what with Elton, and David... ...and Ian, and, well, everyone. You know, what's the problem? It's been done. We've moved on. It's accepted. But the way this would approach it... I mean, if you make it a bit more like, well, Gary Glitter. Gary Glitter? What the fuck has he got to do with it? Vietnam, Cambodia, the whole sex-tourist thing... This is set in Basingstoke. ...then maybe, maybe. But the whole sex-tourist thing has been done to death. As it is, it's... it's not for me. I'm sorry, it just isn't. Look, I'm so keen to work on something with you, Robin. You know that. But this... I'm sorry, it's a "no. " Are you still married? - Yes. - Well done. I'm seeing Dunstan next week. - Are you? - Shall I send him your love? I wouldn't bother. No, best not. Well, I'll leave you to it. He reached grade seven. Miss Richards says if he carries on like this... ...he could get to the Royal College of Music. That's marvelous, Dolly! He's a good boy. You must be so proud. You know, it makes me weep for joy. I worked so hard to get him that fiddle... ...and it's all been worth it. You know, you should hear him, Mrs. H. Oh, I'd love to, Dolly. He can play like an angel. So, what you having then? Monkfish cheeks and ceps. And the Saint-Saens was sensational. Do you know he was found in a pissoir. with his pants round his ankles? Excuse me, sir. The sausages. That accent. I can't quite... Shropshire, sir. - Ah, yes. - Ludlow. Ludlow. Lovely spot. For me! That's it! That's it! That's it! 30 degrees I've got here. It says it all. That's for the bulk of central parts... Nan, I'm back! And, of course, that's where most of the population are. 30 degrees plus expected today... Hello, Nan. Darlin'. Bleedin' hot, isn't it? Do you want anything? Darlin'. How about a nice cuppa, eh? Hello? Hi, it's me. Hey, hon. Is everything all right? Yes, I'm gonna be a bit late. Ah, I've got to pop over to St. Luke's. Is anything wrong? Oh, some mini crisis or other. Probably nothing, but you know how it is. Try to be on time. Well, of course I'll try, but tell them not to wait. I'll be there as soon as I can. Just try, darling. Yes, I will. Promise? - I promise. - Okay. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, chi-chi man! Boom, bye-bye, battyboy. You look at my ass, isn't it? Oi, looking at his ass, chi-chi man! Was there any calls, Nan? Just the one. And which one was that then? It was your mom. Oh, yeah? She wants to see you, darlin'. Don't start, Nan. She said she hasn't touched a drop in weeks. She's a liar, Nan. She ain't, Terry. She's a good girl. No, she ain't, Nan. She might be lots of things, but she ain't no liar. She's a good girl at heart. No, she ain't, Nan. She is, Terry. She's a good girl. No, she ain't! Do you want a ham salad? Give her a call, Ter. - I ain't callin' her! - She wants to see you. - No, she don't, Nan. - She does, Terry. There was a time she could've seen me all she liked. If anything happens, you won't be able to live with yourself. Do you want a ham salad or somethin' hot? Do it for me, darlin'. I'll do you a salad, but I ain't speakin' to her. Gavin has taught me how to love. To love him and to love myself. This is forever, honey. And if it ain't, well, you've got one hell of a good prenup! So, let's all get slaughtered! Bottoms up! Come here, gorgeous! Skiving off, are you? No, sir. It's my break. I'm paying for all this, you know. It doesn't come cheap. I don't expect it does, sir. You know, it's very, very charming that you should call me "sir"... ...but you really don't have to. So, Ludlow. - Yeah. - Very nice. Yeah, a bit on the quiet side. Mmm, it is a bit, I suppose. - But nice enough. - Yes. Ludlow. - Nice castle. - Yeah. Very nice. Love that part of the world. You've never been, have you? Somewhere up north, isn't it? - Help yourself. - No, no, not while I'm on duty. It's my wedding. It's a beautiful ring. Oh. He had it made specially. He must think the world of you. Mmm, it's too big, though. The jeweler fucked up. I've got to have it altered. You don't want to go losing it. Oh, you're right there. You've gotta watch your ring, haven't you? You know, it's incredible. What is? This wedding. I mean, I never, ever thought I'd live to see the day. ...two blokes getting married, I mean. It's just fantastic, isn't it? I suppose it is. Gavin and I have lived together for so long. Yeah, yeah, it is pretty fantastic. You're blushing. It's hot. No, no, I better get back. Where've you been? I was expecting you ages ago. I had to go to the library. Christ knows where your father is! We're going to be late as usual. Darling, use a glass. You'll be all right, won't you? Of course I will. Why don't you go and see Benjie or someone? I don't like the thought of you being by yourself... ...and it's going to be such a lovely night. I'll be fine. I got that gorgeous hummus which you like. ...and some lovely yummy fresh baguette from Honor?. Mom, I'm okay. Oh, I know you are, darling. I must go and put a face on. If father calls, tell him to get his ass in gear. Oh, you're not going, are you? Yeah. I'm finished. Pity. End of my shift. I'll tell you what... Yeah, I'm living with a mate at the moment, south of the river. But I'm moving into my own pad next week. It's only rented-like, but I'm really excited. I bet. I've left home, made the move to London... ...got my own job, and then my own pad. Brilliant. Brilliant. So, what is this place, then? A pantry. What did they use it for? It's where they kept their pants. You're full of it, aren't you? I just love London. I always knew I would, and you know something? What? I do. Charlie with the groom, I don't know. I'll lose my job. Not with me behind you. Mmm. Christ, I'd like to lick the hairs on the back of your neck. You've just got married. You should have other things on your mind. Are you going somewhere nice for your honeymoon, then? Eventually. Gavin's back to work tomorrow. What does he do? He makes people better. And what do you do? I just make money. Won't you be missed? Not here. Where then? Nowhere. We shouldn't be doing this. Oh, come on. We shouldn't. As honest as the day is long, eh? You don't want to end up lonely, Ter. No, Nan. I've got you, ain't I? Who are you gonna have? I'm worried for you. I'll be all right, Nan. I do. I worry for you. Leave it out, Nan. We all need someone, darlin'. Oh, I'll find someone, Nan, don't you worry. Come here. My mobile. What? I want to see you again. You can't. Call me. No. You will, you know. You're very sure of yourself, aren't you? Bye, then. You've got a lovely ass. And you've got a lovely husband. - Where the hell have you been? - I'm sorry. I was running out of excuses. What've you been up to? Oh, for Christ's sake, give me some! I've been twisting with the vicar. It's very pure, so don't overdo it. I was beginning to think you'd had second thoughts. Where's the ring? Oh, it's in my wallet. It kept slipping off. I know I gave him the right measurements! It's all right. I'll take it in tomorrow. Hey. Hot, isn't it? Yeah. I thought you'd gone. No, I ain't gone. Good. I'm Alfie, by the way. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Just, you don't meet many Alfies. Alf! Murray! Hi! How was the wedding? Let me introduce you to... Pint, is it? No, it's okay. My mom rang just before I left. I told her I was doing a wedding, but I didn't tell her it was gay. She wouldn't have minded, would she? Oh, I don't know. She probably knows everything anyway. Yeah, moms usually do. Nice. Yeah, if you like that sort of thing. Pissed all down my trousers. Oh, yeah? Still, you won't mind that, will ya? I said it don't go there... ...but he don't listen, you know what I mean? He's a knob! And he kept pushing, and I kept telling him... ...and then the fucking thing snapped! He's a right knob! About 30 quids worth! He should get the boot. I've been fucking saying that. Hi, Rog. Hey, Robin! How are you? Oh, I'm okay. How are you? Fucking knackered. Come on in and have a drink. What can I get you? - Robin! Sticky fingers! - Hello, Belinda. Fancy one of these? You are looking so well! Isn't he, Roger? A grateful client sent me a couple of cases of that. Oh, I got you this. Oh, you shouldn't have. And I must say, it's bloody nice. - Here you are, love. - Thank you. And you've put on a little bit of weight. - Oh, dear. - No, that's good. - See what you think. - Thanks. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Fuckin'...! See how I trust my lovely Shropshire lad! You've got to call me now. Silly bastard. Something about summer, isn't there? Yeah. Gets the old sap rising. Do you ever get the feeling sometimes that you're missing out? Like the party's going on without you? You don't feel that, do you? It's all a bit aimless, you know? Everything's sort of chugging along. It's something about the kids going to university. I've got a bit itchy in the foot department. I want to play the field again. Well, I've been playing the field since I was 15. It's not all it's cracked up to be. I need women. I just love them, you know? Well, you've got one. It's not the same though, is it? So, what's your name, then? Smithy. Smithy? I like that. Yeah? What's yours, then? Mickey. Irish, are you? No. So, do you live around here? Not far. So, is this your patch, then? Yeah, sort of. How about you? No. I'm from outside of London. Oh, yeah? And where's that, then? Sussex. Sussex, eh? Very nice, very nice. Whereabouts in Sussex? Nutley. Nutley? I ain't... I ain't never heard of Nutley. It's my mom. Oh, yeah? She died a few months ago. It was a heart attack. Just out of the blue. I don't half miss her. - My mom died not so long ago. - Did she? Mmm, yeah. So, what did she die of? She got run down. What? You mean depressed-like? No, by a mail van. - You're kidding. - No, I'm not. They drive like fuckin' maniacs, those guys. That's terrible! Yeah. You know what? What? She was postin' a letter at the time. Christ! Yeah, it makes you think, don't it? I envy you. All that freedom, no ties. Yeah, but look at you. You've got a proper job. You're a big-time barrister, earn a criminal amount of money... wife and kids. You're a proper grown-up. I live in a state of perpetual adolescence. I'm an adolescent at heart. I still enjoy football, a good wank. It was good, wasn't it, school and that? Yeah. Yes, it was. Christ, I need a fuck! Hot, isn't it? # I want to get away # # Why don't you take me away? # Orphans in the storm, eh? Yeah. # Inside your flying machine # # I love your motorcar # I like this one. Can we just?... Can we have it up a bit? Yeah. Yeah, okay. # I want to get away # # Why don't you take me away? # - Such a bloody nightmare! - It doesn't matter. He was so late back! Big recycling meeting about this fining business. You just have to put your foot down! - And I just couldn't leave. - Bloody council! - I am sorry. - It doesn't matter, really. I had a costume fitting, and I was ready. Why are you doing this? 'Cause I hate your fuckin' aftershave! Is Minty here? I'm afraid she had to cry off. Oh, no! Well, she's practically dead with hay fever, so... Let me get you a drink. Have you been at the Botox? No, I haven't! Well, I must say you're looking suspiciously fresh. You... ...fuckin'... ...cunt! Roger and Robin are in the garden. Robin? Yeah, I'm sure you've met. He's that old school friend of Roger's. - Oh, isn't he the?... - Writer. Yeah, that's right. White? Yeah, please. Shut the fuck up! Would I mind a bit of piss, you said. How do you like it, you filthy cocksucker? Eh? Is that nice, is it? Eh? How nice is that? You pathetic little shit! How proud would mommy be now, eh? I'm doing "Howards End. " Very nice. What are you playing? Mrs. Wilcox. - Oh, great! - I'm afraid I don't know it. Oh, you must! Vanessa Redgrave played her in the movie. - Oh, so it's been done before, then? - Everything's been done before. In fact, they only do things now that have been done before. That does seem to be the case. - It's never been done on television. - I think it has. - No, I'm sure it hasn't. - I think you're right. - In the '70s or something. - Yeah. How would you know? You never watch television. I did in the '70s. So who's doing it? Well, Frank Winterton has commissioned it. Did he now? Do you know him? I had a meeting with him this morning, as a matter of fact. A darling, isn't he? Top-up? There's something that's always intrigued me about "Howards End. " It's such an intriguing novel. It's whether or not it's got an apostrophe. Like, is it supposed to be the end of Howard... ...or the end of several Howards... ...or is it just "Howards End"? Anyway, I'm thrilled to bits. - I'm so sorry, Belinda. - Don't worry. I just had to pop something into little Albert. - I bought him the cutest little cap! - How sweet! Just like Andy Roddick wears. He looks so adorable, I could eat him. Come through. Do you know he's up to my lower thigh already? Hello, mate. Where you off to, then? Excuse me. Don't be like that! Hey! Come here! Hello there, mate! Sorry I'm late, Roger. Christ, you look fucked! Do I? You could do with a stiff one. Gotcha! Belinda and I met at Pilates... ...and I showed her some photographs of little Albert. He's my grandson. And we just hit it off immediately. - She's lovely, isn't she? - Yes, she is. - Are you married? - No, I'm gay. Oh, how nice. Have you got a?... What do they call it? Um... A civil partner? Not at the moment, no. Oh. Would you like a Pringle? Oh! My hubby at last! Sorry, darling. You don't know Robin, do you? No, I don't. Close your mouth, darling. You look like a carp. Robin and I were at school together. - Pleased to meet you. - How do you do? God, what was that? What? Weird. Sounded like a scream or something. It's probably a fox being fucked. I've got your pen. Your Parker ballpoint. You dropped it in the library this afternoon. I found it and thought I'd bring it over. Can't I come in? Why? So I can give it to you. You can give it to me here. But I'd like to. What? Come in. You can't. Why not? Because I don't want you to. Why not? Because I don't. You're not doing anything. How do you know? Look, you gonna give me the pen, or am I gonna shut the door? Move your foot. I thought it might be nice... to have a chat. A chat? Yes. I don't want to have a chat. I don't know you. You would if we had a chat. Shove off, all right? Move your foot and piss off! I want to come in. No more games, all right? Just get back home to mommy and daddy, okay? They're out. Then go back and wait for them. Don't you want your pen? What are you so worried about? I'm worried I'm going to belt you one if you don't get the fuck out! You wouldn't. Don't push it! I bet you. Why can't I stay for a minute? What's wrong with that? We've always seen each other in the library. What's the problem? I'm bored to death over there, really. I don't want to go to bed yet, and... I just thought we could have a chat. Five minutes, that's all. Then I'll go home, I promise. You're doing history, aren't you? I'm doing history, too. Amongst other things. Are you at college? What's your favorite period? I quite like Hitler. Not the bloke. But, you know, the Third Reich and all that. Is that it, then? What? Our chat. I could probably find a few other things to talk about. You needn't have pushed so hard. You needn't have put your foot at the door. Do you think I could have a glass of water? Ahh. Your ass looks nice. Good view. Here we go. Here we go. We're married! Oh, no! We are fucking married! Keep it down! Thanks. Thank you. Have you had a fire? Yeah. What happened? I had an accident. Oh. I left the toaster on. You should tell someone. I've told you. It's a lousy neighborhood, isn't it? This side of the street, it is. I don't like people around here much. Do you? I wouldn't know. I keep myself to myself. That's difficult to do, though, sometimes, isn't it? You haven't been here long, have you? No, I haven't. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm all chatted out. Good night. It's not that late. You want to be home for your mom and dad. They won't be back for ages. I want to turn in. My foot hurts. I told you, you shouldn't have put it in the door. I'm Theo, by the way. Who are you? Tim. Now, fuck off! Do you think I could have another glass of water, please, Tim? He's 18 months. Yes, you said. Little Albert! I wasn't so sure about the Albert, but it's starting to grow on me. Good job he isn't called Ivy! Oh, he does make me laugh! You know, I popped in earlier, I was telling Belinda. I had to give him the cutest little cap, like Andy Roddick wears. Now he is cute. And he was prancing around without a stitch on, as usual. He is so proud of his willy. I think it's a stage that boys go through. And it's surprisingly big, isn't it, Julian? And, do you know, he climbed onto my lap. ...and tried to push it through my buttonhole! It can't be that big, then. Oh, they were very big buttons. And, in the end, I just couldn't resist and had to kiss it. Mmm, lovely! Why are you always by yourself? It's how I like it. Don't you have any friends? All the chat... All the rubbish... It needn't be like that. Yeah, well. I've never mucked in. I've always been ever so slightly shunned... ...by my lot, your lot. Not quite up there. You get used to it out on a limb. Not quite up there enough. We could be friends. No, we couldn't. Of course we could. You're what, 14? 15? I'm coming up 30. Even if we had anything in common, we could never be friends. You've seen me before, haven't you? You live over the road. I mean, you've noticed me. You've looked at me, haven't you? And in the library... You've looked at me like I've looked at you. That's all I'm saying. You better go. Can I have some lager, please? No. Go on. Mom and dad let me have a drop sometimes. Then go home and have a drop! You're very quiet tonight, Julian. Are you all right? Poor bloke's knackered. Give him a break. I am pretty tired, actually. Working late, were you? Well, he's always working late, aren't you, darling? Well, that's no good. All work and no play? Well, that's what I tell him! You should let your hair down once in a while. Exactly! Do you know something, Robin? I think you should take him in hand! You don't need me to take you in hand, do you, Julian? That's enough! Enough, okay? I'm sorry, I really am pretty wiped out. Darling, would you like us to go? No, no, I'm fine. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please, don't... Don't worry. We all get a bit scratchy when the pressure's on. Another stiff one, eh? That should do the trick. Thank you. Got a light? Yes. Sorry. Nice, isn't it, the moon? Oh, yes. Yes, it is. You been here long? Not long, no. What, live 'round here, do you? No. Whereabouts then? Out west. Out west, eh? Yes. Very nice. Yes, it is. So how'd you get here, then? On the bus? I drove. Oh, yeah? What car you got? - Very inquisitive, aren't you? - Bother you, does it? No, no. That's all right, then. Isn't it? It's an Audi. An Audi, eh? One of them big fuckers... ...or like one of them little hairdresser types? An A4 Estate. Got a family, then? No. Makes you wonder, don't it? What? Why that star's next to that one. ...and, you know, that one's next to that. Yes, I suppose it does. Do you know what I think? No. I think it means fuck all! It's bleedin' hot, isn't it? Yes, it is. You know, I wouldn't half like to see your A4 Estate. Would you? Oh, yeah. I love a big motor. Mickey. Joe. Hello, Joe. What was that? It's over there. Joe! Joe! Fuck! Fuck! Help me, please. Help me. Alfie, isn't it? Help me. Is this yours, is it, Alfie? Please, help me. That's a little diamond, isn't it? And what's this next to it? Looks like a sapphire to me. What do you reckon, Alfie? Sapphire, is it? And it's not yours, you say? Get help. Well, that is nice. Very nice, indeed. And by the middle of 2010, we aim to cut our emissions by at least... Darling, we really don't want to hear. ...about Camden's carbon footprint. - By at least 20% percent. Do we, Robin? Julian? Actually, I think it's rather interesting. See, darling, no one does. Top up, Pete? Better not. No, I've always got on with gay men. I have, really. They're so funny and unthreatening. In fact, we've got quite a few gay friends, haven't we, Julian? I've never counted. But I have to admit, there is a part of me that's rather old-fashioned. I do love the idea of the strong, protective man. ...battling it out in the field. ...and then returning home for some vigorous impregnation. No dissension there, old chap. Don't you think you should go outside? Does anybody want me to go outside? No, it's fine. You wouldn't do that sort of thing, would you, Robin? I'm sorry, I don't know what you are talking about. Well, you know, having it away in bushes. Marion. Well, it does seem rather irresponsible! It depends, doesn't it? I'm sure any of us would have it away anywhere. ...if we felt desperate enough, hm? But some of them... Oh! And I don't mean you, Robin. They do tend to push it in your face. You could say that. And all this sniffing around in the dark. It's a bit doggie-like, isn't it? And is it really necessary? Marion! I mean, we accept you now. Can't you behave like normal people? I think you've made your point. Perhaps we enjoy sniffing around in dark places. Perhaps we find this acceptance that you refer to. ...just ever so slightly boring. Perhaps we miss that little jolt of excitement. What do you think, Julian? I think we can all do with a little excitement in our lives... ...so I suppose I'd have to agree. Really? There's so much more for your lot. with all those clubs and things, and cottages and black rooms. Back rooms. - Do you go clubbing much? - No, I don't. No, I don't suppose you do, considering... Considering what? That you haven't been too well, have you? I don't go clubbing anymore. ...probably for the same reason that you don't. We're past it. Anyway, how do we know that this... ...this poor chap outside was "sniffing around," as you say? He could have just been walking. And we don't even know that he's gay. And, in any case... ...even if he was sniffing around and fucking like a dog in the bushes... what the hell's it matter? He was in the most dreadful, appalling state... ...and no one... No one deserves to be treated like that. Have you seen me at night... ...watching you? I kneel by the window with a fag. Haven't you noticed? And when your curtains are open... ...I watch you. I watch you, and I wank. You watch me? And you wank? With a fag? Why? Isn't it obvious? I mean, why've you got a fag? I always smoke when I wank. You're not angry, are you? It's not funny! No. No, I know it's not. Look, it's okay. Really. There's a man opposite us. Lives in that council block. Ghastly place! Here we go! What do you mean, "Here we go"? Nothing. A young man, not unattractive... ...but, bleh, there's something about him. Simply because he's the quiet type. - Have you ever spoken to him? - No. Well, there you are, you see! But then I haven't spoken to lots of people by us. You have no idea what he's like! They do say... Ah! They! ...that he's been inside for interfering with youngsters. That's a rumor. - You've smoked a whole pack! - Oh, who the fuck cares? Wouldn't he be on a list or something? These things aren't foolproof! Have you ever seen him with any youngsters? Well, of course I haven't! I'm far too busy. People are... They're scared of being different. And I can understand that. It takes a lot of courage. But... ...if you can be what you are... ...not what you think you should be... ...you'll be happy enough. Understand yourself... ...and you can face anything. If you get sad... ...your luck goes. I've seen you. I've seen you lots. But it's no good. You've got to go. You... You've got to go. Please go. Please. I know for a fact that his flat was attacked. Poor chap. A petrol bomb through the window. That's terrible. Fortunately, he was in, so the flat didn't burn down. - Did he get hurt? - I don't know. Probably kids. Well, it was! And they did it because of what they'd heard. From their fucking bigoted parents! I want to go. Nat! I want to see how my baby is. - He'll be fine. - I don't like leaving him. We've done it before. I want to go! I really find your complacency quite unbelievable. Just because he keeps himself to himself. ...doesn't mean there's anything sinister going on. These stories don't just come out of thin air! There must be some reason for them. And imagine if they're true, hm? What if he started interfering with Theo? No! Sorry. Hang on. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Try again. Gently. Gently. Yeah. Gently. Ohh. Slowly. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Jesus Christ! Where'd you learn this? It's not difficult. - You do understand, don't you? - Of course. It's a funny old night, isn't it... with all that nastiness over the road? And I just want to get back and give him a big hug. I'd love to see him again. Oh, he's gorgeous. He's a bit moody, but... How old is he now? Nearly 15. Oh, what a lovely evening! Yeah. Monkfish cheeks! You're a card! Thank you. - Did you see anything? - I'm sorry? Well, you were obviously in there for the long haul. Where exactly? So you must have seen something. I don't know what you're on about. You did, didn't you? Excuse me. Because if you did, you really should tell the police. I am aware of my responsibilities. I don't give a toss about your peccadilloes. You really have been somewhat tiresome tonight. with your snide looks. But I do care that some poor bastard has had the shit beaten out of him. It's rather puerile, if you don't mind me saying. And if you saw anything that could be remotely helpful. ...in finding the bastards who did it... Everything okay? Yeah, fine, thanks. ...then you have got to... got to tell someone. Because next time, Julian, it could be one of us. By the way... Nice cock. Theo, darling. Oh, no! Oh, my...! Oh, my God! No. You gotta go. Hold it! Which floor? This is such a mistake. First or second? There'll be a perfectly reasonable explanation. There better be. Which door? I don't know. Which door? I think this is the wrong floor. Oh, for God's sake! You're not gonna say anything, are you? Of course not. 'Cause if you did, that would really, really fuck things up. Why would I? It's what I wanted. It's what I want. Who's that? Get in there. Where is he? Sorry? Theo! Nat, please! What is it? What's wrong? Oh, you're his parents. Get out of there. Why? Tim. Pleased to meet you. - Peter. - Hi. What the hell are you doing? Get out, for Christ's sake! Mom! What are you doing here? What's wrong with you? If you don't tell me what's going on, I'm going to call the police! The police? If he has laid one finger on you... If you have touched my son... - Nat, please. - What do you mean, "Nat, please"? - He's 14! - Mom! Well, have you? Have you touched him? Have you touched him? - Dad, tell her! Nat! Of course I haven't. Why would I touch him? - You're half-naked! - It's very hot. Oh, will you shut up? Tell me, Theo, why are you here? - To give him this. - What? I picked it up by mistake this afternoon in the library. ...and found it in my things. How do you know it's his? 'Cause I've seen him use it. It's quite distinctive. Look, black and gold, see? You mean you see each other in the library? Sometimes. In the history section. I see lots of people. What's the problem? I told you there'd be an explanation. So I thought I'd bring it over. At midnight? I couldn't sleep, and I could see his light on, so I thought, "Why not?" Darling, you didn't have to go into his flat to give it to him! It's really nice of him, though. Very thoughtful. Yeah. Most lads would have nicked it. So, why have you still got it? - There you go. - Thanks. - Right. Let's go. - Yeah. You've been smoking! And alcohol! - You stink of alcohol! - So do you. Don't you dare speak to me like that! Have you been feeding my son alcohol and cigarettes? - Feeding? - Nat, come on. - Well, have you? - Mom! Well, say something, why don't you? Let's go home. I wish you fuckin' would! I know you've been up to something. Nothing's happened. I can smell it. - Dad, tell her. Nothing's happened. - Come on, Nat. Get off me! Great, just great! Can I put something on that? If you so much as look at my boy again... Sorry. Sorry about all this. Oh, fuck! I have a Mr. Cape on the line. Cape? Robin Cape. Did he say what it was about? Only that it was very important he should speak with you. Julian? What do you want? Have you called the police yet? Now, listen to me... He's dead. He died in the night. So unrecogniz able, the police said... ...that he had to be identified by his fingerprints. I thought you should know. Hot, isn't it? Live around here, do you? It's not bad, I must say. Nice view, fresh air. So, where do you live, then? Not around here. You have got a tongue, then. You see all sorts up here... walking their dogs, flying their kites... ...pulling up the nettles. I saw George Michael up here the other day. Did ya? Yeah. Yeah, he's got a place around here. What's your name? Alf. Alf. I like that. Merv. Pleased to meet you, Alfie. That's very smart. Where'd you get that? From an admirer. Must have thought a lot of you. Yeah, he did. I can see why. Hello, Alfie. You know something. I think you're pretty new at this. I think I'm gonna have to teach you. Teach me a lesson? Oh, yeah, I'd enjoy that. Try again. - Danny? - Yes, Miss? If there's ever anything you want to tell me... What should I want to tell you, Miss? If there's anything bothering you... There's nothing bothering me, Miss. Or if there's anything on your mind. There's nothing, Miss. - Lf there is. - There isn't. Good. Good. I'm here to help, you know. Thanks, Miss. What happened to you? I walked into a door. On the heath? I walked into a door on the heath. Sorry. Did you report it? What's to report? They shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. The police need to know what's going on. Does that hurt? No. We're not living in the Dark Ages anymore. It's time these Neanderthals caught on. Yeah. Dead right, Doc. I mean, all I was doin' was sniffin' out a bit of knob. There's nothin' wrong in that, is there? You know where I'm coming from... Don't you? Look to the right. Left. Who knows, Doc? Up. One day we might bump into each other again. Down. You wouldn't know what had hit you. Right. Left. You better watch it. Up. I'm a married man. Down. Oh, yeah? And we don't want my husband getting jealous, do we? Oh, no, we won't want that, would we? Now, if I could just... What's up? Hello? Gav! Are you all right? I need to ask you about something. Did you take the ring back to the jeweler's today? What, the ring? Yeah, the ring. Did you? Yes. Yes, of course I did, yeah. You did? There was no problem or anything? No. No, he said it'll be ready next week. Why? Is anything wrong? You didn't drop it or lose it? 'Cause if you did, I'd understand. I wouldn't mind. I could get another one made. I mean, there wouldn't be a problem. No, no. I told you, I took it into the jeweler's. Gavin, will you tell me what's going on? Gav? Gav, what is it? I'll, um... I'll see you later, okay? The 24-year-old-waiter, originally from Ludlow... who was found last night on Clapham Common. ...by a pensioner walking his dog. He was taken to hospital... ...but doctors were unable to save him. A police spokesman said. ...it was one of the most vicious attacks they'd ever seen. ...and one more depressing statistic confirming the steady increase...
