Hey... Ah, ah, ah, [He is praying] Ah, ah, ah, ah, Do your ears hear? The one who wants to pull a rock and start a mill has not been born yet! If a mill turns in any of these villages that does not belong to Beyg... Are you listening? If it is not ours I break its roof on the head of the miller! Wheat must become flour in our mills Go and thank God the Beyg said not take your breath Move a little. I respect your mane! Those bastards, all that was left to do was to drink your blood Here, freshen up your throat. Here Drink up! Listen, your head is wounded If you leave it alone it will get infected and will never heal This an ointment but it burns Put your hand on this Quran, do it If they wanted you dead they would have mashed you with the first hit Ouch, ouch, it burns Why did they beat you like this? Where isIslamic goodness? Your hands were a cure for me Could you see us? - I was praying It seems like God wanted it to be like this. There is a reason for everything Only if you knew what reasons this rock holds for us Can you believe that coming of this rock to our village is even more urgent than our daily prayer? Where are you from? - Your body does not show what all is broken I just hope that your bones are not broken Where are you from? - "Mohammad Abbad" It is two village over from here I will lay you on this. It is difficult. You cannot you up on the mule... Can you bear it? Now talk if you feel like talking so you won't feel the pain as much God will not forgive him. He broke me for this rock Much blood has been shed by this rock Women became widows, fathers lost their sons Until now about twenty people have cut this rock If one mill that belongs to the people turn in one of these villages... We will have everything that we want This Beyg is merciless All mills around here belong to him With one mill he has his hands in everybody's belongings Put this bags inside, weigh this one Greetings - God give you power Thank you Give me a glass oftea too Doesn't anybody want to give me a hand to put this mashed bag of bones down? His name is Sheer - Ali He is your relative, your friend... He has the same blood as you! It seems like this man has given me the wrong address Isn't there one among you to help me put him in his house? I know I can do it He is a good man, He is "Sheer - Ali" This is "Zabih" Is he bloody? God shouldn't forgive the one who made him like this He is bloody! Is he bloody? - Only one man can do work in this village? Doesn't God cast a shadow here? Tell me "Sheer - Ali" were you an enemy of these godless people Before you wanted to break that stone? - You have passed by that house, haven't you... What is the matter with you stranger? The shade of that house is bigger Have you come to rub these people's poverty on their face? What does he know, Ha! - This is "Yar" He is an able body - I know This bloody man says that you're an able body, but I say that you talk like the old ones It's been long since the body and the soul of this village is wounded We have given much for pulling that rock... But that house holds God favor I told him you cannot do this "Sheer - Ali" None of us could stand in front of that house Now, who are you stranger? What do you say? Be yourseIf and put him down and go People here are wishy - washy You just got here and talking big? Do you have name? What is your name and reputation? What do you need a name for? What was and what became, I don't know... But to this God's name I saw that this man's life hung from his toe for you! A man who has a name does not submit to bullying You give five bags of wheat and get one bag of flour... If the mill is yours four bags of flour comes from five bags of wheat Be thirsty first and then get to the water so you'd know what thirst is These people are not thirsty for that rock yet Where is a man with bones? - This is one! I am the second What do you want from the bottom of your heart? Look for it Don't keep sitting on the corner of these houses and fan yourselves. It needs determination One or two men can't handle that rock, and the time is today! Listen stranger, we are satisfied with what we've got What you have is what you're sitting on! They are scared, I told you so He works in the mill, he eats bread all the time He won't give me any. He won't give them any either Where should I take you? - To "Mohammad Hassan's" house You mean only one door is open to you in this village? His house is open to everybody except me! - I know where it is... It is that way - He's right, he knows But if you take "Sheer - Ali" over there you will make us laugh a bunch! I have some news. Where is Agha? I want to see him - Can't you tell me? I want to tell him personally Hello sir The Russians from one side and the British from another side And the gum chewing Americans kept on chewing and chewing and chewing and hanging around Many betrayers. Everywhere full of betrayers... All of them where hired by the foreigners. All of them! Oh, oh, oh, oh Allow me sir I had something to tell you - And the hardheaded Hitler's life was dependent on one bridge... This Veresk Bridge. The victory bridge... Here, in the north. Had this bridge been closed... Could the supply reach Marshal Patton on one side and Marshal Rommel on another side behind the battle line? Swear to God that they had a world of luck, luck... That this bright horizon... What do you want boy? - Sir, somebody has brought Sheer - Ali into the circle... And says plenty of bad things - What does he say? Sir, he tells people that they are cowards, cowards That you give two bags of wheat, and get one, one bag of flour I don't know sir, He, he says things like this Who is the one who is with him? - He is a stranger... Stranger, a mountain man - Hah, mountain man? How great is the God - He is a mountain man! He is a mountain man Now, where is the stranger taking Sheer - Ali to? I don't know sir. He said that he would take him to Mohammad Hassan's house, That black smith What? Ah, ah, it's here, Mohammad Hassan's house is here It is a guest sister, he is not well We have somebody who is not well Who is there Fatimeh? He is a stranger. He says that he has someone who is not well... He is a guest - Bring them in In the name of God... come Come... You have come to us, what do you need? God's blessing upon you! Your house may be Mecca! It seems like only one household in this village eats bread and that is your household This man does not have a good place left on his body, asked me to bring him to you That drummer knew the way - Me! Fatimeh, make some tea Mountain man, there are ways and short cuts in your eyes Whomever comes to my house will not be sent out Who whispered in your ears that this man's place is here? - He himself He had heard that you are the man of hard days! This man is a spring that had never had green for us... Let alone the green, he put black garment on us Look at that woman - Man is sometimes small and sometimes heavy What he has done, I don't know. His God told him to seek refuge with you Why is he bleeding? Why is he this way? - I was praying that I saw that they are beating him up He was in the mountain, all alone He was determined to load a mill stone and bring it to the village all alone I brought him, I, I He is bloody for the rock! Why did you go alone? You know that you can't do that rock You wanted to bloom man that it's so late? Is the rock in its place? - It needs one more day ofwork... Only the center is left Ah... ah... These wounds need ointment Do you have ointment with you? - There is everything is a gypsy's saddle bag except a home The one who went crazy in the mill and said crappy things in the circle in the evening is here Bring him I sent two tractors to his land and work on it... I didn't ask him for money either. When his crop came up he totally ignored me I called him and told him: Hey believer, let your daughter become happy... Let her come here and hang around here That's him sir... And he is still being hardheaded - Here, this is one of them Didn't I say? Now, what do you say bastard? Don't talk dirt What I say is what wheat says, that if these men of yours... - Come, come here... Come and sit here to discuss our issue... Come - Go let him give you some! Come here, come It's okay here, tell me what you want to say Come, don't take it hard, come and sit and smoke a piece so we can discuss the our matter Come, come. He really wants to come but he is shy to do it Ah... Ya Allah, Ya Allah Ah,... well How are you, hah? Well, whenever you have something to say... You wanted something, you know, come straight to me Well, what has happened now? - The truth is that when your men confront somebody... They really think that there is no law and they are it and that they can take us and... - Oh, now... These things are not yours anymore When there is a group it's like that, you don't know that yet? Oh! Look, no, that one, he is exactly like a cow... Or this one for instance. Well, is it worth it to put your seIf in trouble for that? No! In all these villages that are around here no man is left who thinks about bringing the rock It does not go in their ears that Beyg is sharing and taking their entire belongings with one mill What belongs to a man is the land that he farms One of the people who took our lives, stranger, is this Sheer - Ali! When morning comes ten men are born and at night ten men leave this world What do you know? There are all these men! Ah, ah, ah, ah, no more... Nobody will come in his place any more What a man from among us left for this rock. That was Fatimeh's husband! Whenever there is a talk of the rock my heart gets jerked off of it's place In one month of Moharam Seyed Yavar, Heydar, and my brother Along with this Sheer - Ali kept saying : Come man... Make a commitment and show that you are alive too and pull one rope tied to that rock And this man was firm that with three or four people can not pull that rock Now I don't know what part of him started hurting that he got up alone to go and pull the stone... And that's when five years have passed from that time You shouldn't light a lamp in any night. There are many lightless nights One more move! Many days and nights my son - in - law, Fatimeh's husband and Seyed Yavar and I went to this man's house Back then this Zabih had not been kicked in the temple by a horse yet... He was still well. He is still strong! Went to this man's house How much did we extend our hands, how much we were disrespected and broken down The hands that Yavar, and Heydar, and I extended toward this man never became alive again God bless his soul, Heydar soaked in blood! His body was left in the mosque for a couple of days because of fear He was a piece of my heart. After that I never left my house... Neither for their mosque ceremonies, not for their funeral, and not for their weddings And here, this Fatimeh. She was only one month into his marriage... When this man broke our back! If on the day when the smell of blood had stopped Heydar and me... This man had come out of his house everyone in the village would have come out shouting God is great It can't be that you put all of your life on the corner ofthis house and the sound of the hammer and anvil Hit your hammer outside of the house, since your heart is so large Will you be late if you come out of your house one more time Your voice echoes in my ears Come out of your house one more time... We will put out lives on our hands! Go after Yavar I am a mountain man... Once a year out tints hit the ground on the other side of the mountains I am not much with them Ever since our black hearted khan received money and automobile and sold horses and girls... I just watch them from distance since my mother and my sister are with them I won't miss being with them any more Among us nobody weaves carpet, and the girls feel ashamed sitting by the carpet weaving frame I was on my way to the city of Mallek Abbad to buy a blanket I was praying when I saw this man To me, a man's work is his prayer and it is worshiping God to stand in front of force. That is much more important than reading Quran I will be with you and anybody who comes along If you have the life in you come out of your house one more time Who is this Seyed Yavar? Make him present That Godless and crippled man is the devil himseIf! He cannot stand in front of the righteousness. Hussein gave his life and fought wickedness It seems like a black stick was broken on your backs You speak as though we do not know what a wound is Do you want your breath to touch it? - Oh yes, I'd like that, but first you have to do something... If you don't do it know this flower wont ever bloom in your heart to have a rock turn in your village Send after this Seyed Yavar - Do you want to go to that white house? I don't want to sneak out and go after that stone tomorrow. That cripple must know Zabih - What? You know Yavar's place. Go after him and tell to come It is for the thing that we've always talked about Yavar, that rock is easier for me than this drum To be on my shoulder Yavar [Folk music] Hey, you drummer, cut that breath of yours! I am talking to you Nayeb, if Sheer - Ali turns one hair shorter than he was... I will pull your intestine out of your stomach! Are you deaf? Tell your master that it's time for him to pack up and get away before it's late! It seems that your head feels heavy on your shoulder that you've walked to your gallows yourseIf! Who is it that is making noise? "Nayeb" Shepherd... - Yes sir Who is it? - It is Mohammad Hassan the black smith He is taking bad, it is unlucky Make him quiet Ghorban - Hurry, take me to the balcony. Give me my coat Talking to you is like kicking a dog Where is the one who throws you bones? You eat bones too. If I forget about all my belongings I will cut your vein myseIf Before I have you mashed go back to your hole The one who can will not dirty his hands asshole... I know what to do with you, I know how to waste you Who are you? - The one who will sit you on a hot burning tree trunk Any time that... - Where are they? They are over there sir - Who are you? - Hello sir Hello sir - Hello sir - Hello sir Hello sir - Hello sir Hello sir Does anyone dare to come here and shout? By your order and your blood sucking assistant... Your people have beat up poor Sheer - Ali and put him out of commission Who will answer? He should go and make a complaint - Where should he go to complain? Well, to the station - Station? They won't give you up to listen to him! Now, by the way, what business of yours is it? Wasn't that enough for you? Whenever you stepped out of your house and barked made a mess among twenty people I've had mercy on you so far But this time I will have twenty sticks broken on your back and... - I am with all ofyou... This time I will either uproot you or my root will be pulled out ofthis village Stick this in your ears and realize how this leach is stuck on your existence It will be your root that will be cut Have you become people's representative because you are stronger? You have no education and you have no brain to be able to understand No, why should I make you understand? If you have no money you cannot farm your land... You cannot irrigate it. Farming a land needs capital Who has that capital here? I do... I am the one who gives them money and takes care of them What place is it that does not have a master? Is it possible? There should be one to organize them, to loan them money, to help them The money interest that this whole village gives cannot pay for my opium for one week Now what do you say in the middle? You got to bold I laid you down... You tongue became long you became the prisoner of your house Now, you are too far gone Do you want to come up here and tell me what your problem is? Do you want money? I will fix you up You want to work for me? You want a shop? Take the butcher shop in the circle If you cross the limit I will not show any mercy and will put your head on a spear Bless the one whose head goes on a spear! This henna has no color for us, color these here We will be going tomorrow for bringing that rock We want to own our own mill And if you think that we can be bought you have vomited in your pants Unless you go by yourseIf. Nobody is behind you Listen, Quran on my arm has a meaning... And the meaning is that it knows the right from wrong... The right is Mohammad Hassan's stick to come down on your head... If it were up to me I would have put crabs on your balls! Hey, throw them out with your sticks, hurry These people throw us out? Hah! Keep them for the time when they tell you that the stone is rolling Now go and twist your wastes mommy boys Let's go Seyed Yavar, ifthere were a great one left that would be you. If your hands are there the stone will roll This mountain man who has come, I don't know what is in his tongue and in his eyes... That has made the talk of the rock to come to the middle, do you want the stone? I don't have anything except my life You get up and stand... Make a shadow and I will stand in your shadow! It's time. When you sent for me my heart said that it's time! It's time - I was a passing mountain man... If you accept me to be among you, let my blood and belief be laid by your feet God bless you. I've heard that it was you who brought Sheer - Ali from the place of that rock And this evening also you stood to the people We gave young lives for that rock, we gave fresh blood for that rock... If your heart reaches peace in being with us without land and without wheat When you invoke Ali's name then you become of our blood! I have nothing with land and I have nothing with wheat, but I have something with force Swear to this hour and this time that I put your shoulders on my forehead The light that is in this man's face makes me to make him my Mecca And now you! Brother, I cannot sit by this door and wait and stare at this door... One time Heydar left and his body came back... This time only you're left Take me with you too - This road is not for a woman. Woman and rock don't match sister You say this so comfortably that you think we want to throw wheat into the wind? When Heydar left this shirt was full of red flowers When they brought him and left him behind the door they were saying that this is the result of going for the rock I blackened this shirt myseIf... The red flowers are still there I don't have any other shirt to blacken - A woman with us? I don't want to be disrespectful but if Fatimeh stays here... That cripple and this village, you know I can make tea, warm up your dinner and prepare food... Pull the mules - Okay... Be with us until the village up there You stay with Asieh at the house of Heydar Beyg's, Sheer - Ali's brother If God willing we came back with the rock you come back with us You will take me with you too, won't you? Hitting the drum is no work for me to do I will watch the road, I will hold the rope, I will stand ears I won't let this place on my head to get wounded One man is one force, so far four of us I have to go to the village at night and get support When I was coming Jaffar Reza Goll said that he will be coming with us He had heard, maybe some blood can be found in some vein I don't know what shape is the rock in It is healthily sitting on the mountain Everything has been done on it It only needs a determination The owner oftime (God) is behind us If we make our hearts as one our arms become one We have to pack up the mules at night God willing we will start before sun up It's time You have come well Jaffar! It's here Heydar Beyg, I am Mohammad Hassan the black smith Step on our eyes, come in - Come in. It is family's house, come in In the name of God - Welcome Hello - Hello, isn't Heydar Beyg here? Dear Fatimeh, your presence is welcomed You brought flowers, you brought the spring with you You're still wearing black, let your heart be white! Thank you, I have come to stay with you If this brother of mine goes under the stone... Let's sit in the shade - Let's rest Let's go to the shade - Heydar Beyg What? - Well, we kiss the hand of our master! Is that you Mohammad Hassan? - I am your servant Greetings At last you took your veil off and came out ofyou house... Didn't you worry about strangers seeing you? Daddy, they are our guests. This is Fatimeh You know that losing a young man and becoming a widow is hard We were together. I wish the stick had hit my head instead of him! He didn't even moan once You are my eye! I was in black until now... It was because of the rock that I wore this scarf. I was afraid that black might bring bad luck Fatimeh will stay with you These brave ones have joined their hands for the rock This time we will move it - Like a dog scared of the shepherd! You that are afraid of the shepherd want to fight alongside the woIf Can you be called a man? - It is disrespectful, brave, but If your back broke on this road it gives us power to move It has been forty years that this talk has become the candy in the party of spineless ones. Only talk! This black smith has left my heart now! If you sing a song to the ears of wheat it won't grow. It needs action You made me embarrassed in front of these braves Your village had only its back broken, but our village gave life Long life to you, may God give you patience You talk boldly a lot black smith... You closed the door and earned reputation and talk What business has the rock with you? Rock moves the rock and wind moves the weed Go and pull weed - Your back didn't break for the weed, it broke for that rock That time when that blessed soul Heydar was present we bled... You were not this old... - Daddy, guest is dear to God... It's okay that I am a stranger, greeting him brings health! His heart is a burnt tree trunk - It's time for us to go The final word. Had Fatimeh stayed in that village she would've been unsafe... She is safe here with you If God willing we came back with the rock we will take her with us Hah, Fatimeh is my daughter... Your account doesn't pair up with hers - You're our master If you want brave Heydar to give us a bowl of tea when we come back the rock must be with us Your heart has been saddened by the young ones - May your heart be green, pray for our arms! May God protect you Your heart is large, hope that you'll forgive us If we return and the God was with us the sound of the rock will come with us too Hit them... hit them... - You heathens Go over there You heathens - Are your heads too much for your bodies?

They want to mill their wheat themselves They want to run the mill themselves This mill will come here in our village tomorrow and will make its sound... Another morning in that village up there and another morning in that other village Pay attention... If day after tomorrow the sound of our flour mill reached the sky and... The smell ofwarm flour came from your mill... Won't our children hold their heads up? He is right - It's the truth Anybody who wants to put the legs of these men of God under this rock... Has to answer to the owner ofthis! - I seek forgiveness from God God is great. God is great... - I seek forgiveness from God, I ask for repentance from God Those who laugh in fake and show you black money...

Nayeb has been around here since this dawn... He moves about like a wounded woIf... And keeps trying to be discrete Seyed Reza's son was bringing me the news and he said... He has gathered many stupid godless men around... And maybe he has put some money in their hands and spoke about a golden spring to them! Good is that you all gave each other your hearts and then your arms! You're welcome Jaffar, you have determination! Why didn't Reza come? He was so hot about it His wife stopped him I heard that she said : Do you want me to become a widow like Fatimeh? A woman who wants a coward man how does smell his breath? God is great God bless his soul, my father use to say... A man is one who is a little heavy on the shoulder of the earth... These days manhood is the story of mountain and a hoof broken horse. It is difficult! Zabih - Yes? Why didn't you bring your drum with you? I gave it to Mr. Reza, the kerosene seller... I told him that I either come back and bang on it myseIf or bang on it on my grave They bang it inside their hearts because of fear. Thanks to your courage since you had it from beginning I won't forget, the first that we wanted to go for the rock Are you listening Heydar? - Yea Zabih was not loose and out of it like he is Nayeb's mule kicked him in the temple with it's new nailed shoe so hard that l thought he would be gone Here, this is it! Since then I became fat and banged on the drum The old man sat in the corner ofthis yard and stared at the ground! He use to say : My back has gone in the rock & all of my mind is with the rock and that is why the land where my house is on is made of rock Slowly the life of this rock was taking him The first bread made from the flour that comes from this mill... I will donate with dates in the memory of Heydar! A good man shouldn't stay in this world When this rock reaches the village and sets in place take offthe mourning clothes that you have on for Heydar They say as long as mourning clothes is worn by the survivors, the dead will be in mourning too This was late Heydar's way One night floodwater was running to the village, and we had wheat stored in the barn. Water was getting to the barn, My brother wasn't there I saw Heydar over there with a lantern light in his face. He diverted the floodwater from getting to our wheat. The wheat stayed dry. He put one flower on the mantle and left Two days later at sunset he came with a package of sweets and asked me for marriage The flower on the mantle hadn't dried yet when he left for the rock and never came back More power to you brave Why don't you come and sit by the other braves? I had your bed laid over there by the others No, I won't sleep there... I will stay by this rock So the unbelievers cannot attack. Unbelievers! Now, how did you all bring it? You have checked on this rock so many times since the beginning of the evening I remember you from the old time... I know you Do you remember me? - Yes, I remember The other time you were there too This time the rock is also! They killed Wake up... Bleeding... - What has happened? Blood is coming from here... Wake up... - It is Zabih! What is the noise? - Zabih They killed... Killed... - What is with you? What has happened?

[Mourning ceremony] Zabih, you haven't eaten, come, night weather is a thief, it will come out of your skin Come, sit and eat Had I had a sorna, I don't mean disrespect... I would have gone on a high place and blown in it so hard that the sound could reach our village to Beyg's ears and turn them over! I wish I had my drum to bang on it for you Only a drum by itseIf? - With his sorna... Would it be bad? It would have been sound though The value of a man is in his good name Your heart doesn't seem to be with us - Why? Why isn't it? Because you neither could hear Yavar's sorna nor Zabih's drum They played it and we heard it - Eat Zabih... If a man doesn't have a life how can he give his life? At the end, the stone carver will put a stone on all of us Either the one who is a believer or the one who is not You, Asieh, what is with you? The old man left. He had a good fortune that he didn't die under a blanket or in the corner of a teahouse They killed him under this rock. Our power is not only for that hollow stone... It is for many other things that we each know We want to be green within! God knows how much that old man sat on that stone in the front yard and listened to the village young men I told you, I will make you a bride myseIf! - He wanted to hear all the news He knew if a chicken laid an egg in the village When this rock turns we will wear colorful shirts Now, the smell of spring and wheat can be smelled very well From now on we both put our hands in the bread oven. May your sky be clear! Human is like a tree. As long as it has roots in the earth is not dead Man's work is his root... This action of us becomes our root that cannot be pulled out People say that we don't have any wheat, why do we want a mill? What they say is that they learned milling, good for them, they have to profit by it Why should all farms be planted? The land of people up there, the land of people down there... We sit by the water, land, seed, stem and scythe and then the people from that white house take the profit? They have made everyone believe that we have to be scared The property of a peasant is his land and the one who farms it Is it justice for five bags of wheat to go and return in one bag of flour? No respect is left for anything If I had a green turban on my head in front of this man who has been dressed green no great thing happens This gypsy saturated me with life When he puts his hand on the Quran on his arm and his power behind that rock and moves it... I say that there is a reason for God's every action This man's heart has the rain and the sun together in one place When I saw him in my master, Mohammad Hassan's house for the first time... There was Goodness in his eyes - Praise "Ali "that the bread that I ate and the barley that my horse was honest Among men one cannot be the servant of a coward! My shade was in a cave and my sun was on the lay of land, we get out powers from the earth Treachery does not lighten our nights and doesn't turn our cloudy sky in to sunny I know that I have never gone by evil with this horse of mine Where did he go? - No... Let him go. His body is just taking up life I knew but I didn't know that you knew too Why did he come? Do we eat more than a piece of bread and a little milk that we have to dip our bread into dirt too? I ask for forgiveness. Your holiness, please forgive us! What happened? Why did he leave? - He went to... I hope that he comes out ofthis night with his head up! [The sound of river] Come... Help us God... - Come animal, move Help us God... - It's good - Your village is coming Untie the mule, down there I am holding it Mohammad Hassan, we are by the river... Our difficulty is this! I was thinking that Jaffar with Beyg's people come back It feels like this whole rock has fallen on my chest Look, what a people, not even one person has come to even watch! Yavar... - I am thinking about this water Only this river is left, it's behind that hill My God, I would like to get married! Oh God, our reward will be with "Ali" "Ali" - Ya "Ali" My "Ali" Ya "Ali" - Ya "Ali" Ah, watch it, watch it... - Be careful Move animal, come - Ya "Ali" Come... Come... - Come you all... Go - Hold it, hold it - Come animal, come... Come... come... - Slowly "Mohammed" - Ya "Mohammed" Move animal Come... Shout at them, shout... - Move animal, come... Ya "Ali" - Come... come Come animal... come Come animal... - Come everyone, come this side... Come this side Come Pull this way... pull everybody... My "Ali", Help us "Ali" Pull... Pull... - Come. Come this side Come... Go... Come... Pull... - Pull... Pull Fatimeh May "Ali "help us - Oh my "Ali" Come.. - Ya "Ali" My "Ali, help us "Ali" - Pull, pull, pull Pull, pull - Ya "Ali" - Ya "Ali" There is a stone caught under it - Take it out It's stuck under it - Get it out Go, go animal - Don't get your hand stuck there Oh God Ya "Ali", say Ya "Ali" - Ya "Ali" That was it - come... Come... Ya "Ali"... say Ya "Ali"... Say Ya "Ali", Ya "Ali" Pull, pull Oh God Come... - Hurry and Pull... Ya "Ali", say Ya "Ali" Come this side... - Ya "Ali" Come, come, come... Go, go Oh God Pull Asieh, pull, pull, pull... Pull in the name of God Steer that way - Come... I can't believe it... Come and sit in the shade God wanted it to be, come and sit in the shade "Ali "was helping us, "Ali", My "Ali "! God bless your courage! God bless you Ah... "Ali", "Ali "! I wish the old man, my father was here Had he passed this river with us he would have become young again Look over there, It's Jaffar Jaffar What has happened? - Jaffar... Say something believer, what has happened? No, it was obvious whit is with wrong with him... And now he has come full of regret. It would be better if no woman is there Put me under this rock that I am not worthy of your breath It is clearly apparent in your eyes that the light of righteousness has come into you The night that Mohammad Hassan came to tell me to come and pull the rock... I saw Reza, the well digger, left and came back with Nayeb for me to be among you He gave me a hundred Tuman too. And those lowlifes told me that my mother and my sister would not be safe The plan was to cut the mule ropes In the middle ofthis river and set the rock loose But when I saw you and your arms... And thought why there is power in them... I realized what you are and what hundred Tuman is! Beyg has given all ofthose men either money or promises They are evil, put me under this rock! If these people were as much a man as you are the village will belong to this rock! Yavar, kill Nayeb... Kill him for God sake! They say that they have crossed the river Has the rock crossed too? - Yea, the village has become quiet Move animal, move... This way, this way, this way... - Come animal... Come... - Come... My "Ali" - Move animal Come, come animal, come... Come... come... Oh the messenger of God! Come animal... If you take one more step forward you will be responsible for your own blood! Are you all for this rock and us? I have nothing to say to you, the one who is holding a gun. My words are for you people... That from Islam you Moslems are left! These people recognize the right from the wrong... That is why they are standing here to give you your answer in case you don't listen First tell me who taught these people what is right? The right that you and your master taught them? Or the right that was in the power that dragged this stone all the way here? Are you four men and two women and one idiot the right? What about you who is holding a gun? - It is hard on them to see that women are behind this rock It should be hard on them that they are like the devil! I am talking to you... This is our final words We have no more life to give for this rock... But for you who is the servant offorce and your master... We have hundred more lives to put forward - Shepherd... The master is calling - I was told to try my utmost not to shed your blood... But if you take one more step forward from there Prayer for the dead will become necessary for you! - Who gave you this order? The master - The hell with you and your master! He is your owner and your master Listen, I am talking to you all, I am for you too... For these people, the money for planting is from me.. The money for place is by me, the money for everything comes from me... Where did you get it? Out of your pants? It belonged to these people and you took it from them. Now you have become their owner with their own money? I heard that you said your final word. This is my final word... I don't want anybody's blood to be shed Leave that rock over there and go back to your houses If you ask these people whether they want the rock or they want me... Everybody wants me. That is because I have taken care oftheir problems like a brother... They wanted well, I had it dug. They wanted seed I gave them People, they want to create animosity among us. What bad thing has been between us? Today or tomorrow these people will realize that the owner and master has died away They will get there too! God's land belongs to the one who farms on it Listen people, this man who has become the power offorcing arm has an owner too... They are giving their last push We have brought you the rock and power We brought you a mill so that your wheat is as much as your bread... Be a little less hungry. He is a partner in your property You are scared and he utilizes your fear Where is your courage? You put your hands in the hand offorce? What about your families? Who will take care of them tomorrow? You are making a pact with the devil! If you make a commitment you will hear the noise ofthis rock when it is making flour out of your wheat for yourselves! Listen, this same Nayeb who is holding that gun in his hand like his own child Gave me one hundred Tuman so I would bring a thousand disaster down on these men of God I came and told him that I can't do it This same Nayeb said that I won't pay you more, there are other people too That is why they beat me up like this! - Our Quran asks us... To fight injustice From "Ali "only invoking his name is left. Learn about his fighting Don't read the Quran only on the grave sites, don't stand next to injustice This is your and your family's right that has been taken from you Stop Vali - What are you waiting for? That is Vali - Hurry up, shoot him, shoot him! That is Vali! [The sound of shooting] - Ah... ah... Untie the rock Shoot him! Bastard! - Ah.... He killed him... - God is great Ah, ah,... - He killed him... Kill him Hit them Let it go... Ah... Let him go, let him go... Hit him, hit him with the stick... Oh my "Ali" - Oh my "Ali" Ya "Ali" "Mohammed "!
