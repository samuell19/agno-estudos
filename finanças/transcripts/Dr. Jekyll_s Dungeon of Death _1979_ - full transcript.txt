- Great grandfather Jekyll foolishly used his own body as a subject for his experimentation. That was his fatal mistake. Once the rage emerged, or as he wrote, "Once Hyde emerged and gained control, great grandfather was lost. In the continuous viewing of my experiments filmed here in the laboratory, it is interesting to note how the various subjects react under the influence of the serum. The reaction time of the serum does not appear to be affected in any way by the decrease in dosage. I'm able to study the behavioral changes brought about by the different dosages. The black subjects have less hostility in comparison to the whites. One would think they would have more repressed aggressions. Perhaps I should increase their dosage. Despite the many failures I have endured thus far, I will continue with the human experimentation and discover the secret that will give me the power to control the mind of man. I must continue the testing. To end it now would mean an admission of defeat to the world. And worse, an admission to my beloved Julia that all of my efforts have been in vain. And now her father is coming. His arrival can only mean that I am finally on the verge of a breakthrough. And dare, I hope that I can gain my revenge. The bittersweet revenge that has eluded me all these years. My only real comfort is the sensual and enchanting Julia. Love me, Julia. Take me, Julia. Love me, love me. Do you want to scream? Well scream, then, Julia. I need you to scream. Scream! Do it! Scream, scream. Professor Atkinson. Jekyll. Come in, come in. Please. I'm so sorry. So very, very sorry about Julia. I don't know what to say. Boris will take care of your bags and after you've had a chance to rest, we'll have a long talk in the study. - I still don't believe it, Henry. I can't believe my daughter is dead. Julia was so, she was so alive. So vital. And so happy. So very happy working with me here on the research project. We'd become very close. Very, very close. I had asked Julia to marry me. She'd accepted and we'd planned to tell you and then- Oh my god, Jekyll. What an awful tragedy. Yes. Oh yes. This way Professor. Why Hilda, we thought you'd retired hours ago. My sister, Hilda, Professor. You frightened the Professor half to death, my dear. Back to bed with you. Back to bed with you, Hilda. - Jekyll, do you always keep your house so dark? This way Professor, please. Then when Julia's horse returned alone, Boris and I went looking for her. We found Julia beneath a tree. She had fallen and crushed her skull. She died instantly. When can I see her? - Rest first, Professor Atkinson. Try to get a good night's sleep. Let's face all of that tomorrow. Perhaps you're right, but, tell me something of your work. I've been terribly curious about you and your career, Jekyll. After that unfortunate incident at Oxford in '39, it must've been I had no idea you would've pursued your studies and distinguished yourself so significantly. I'm very pleased with your success. You know, I never could believe that that poor, wretched tramp that you dissected in the operating room at the medical school that night was alive at the time. Ah, the past, yes. Well, of course he wasn't, Professor. Those stories were spread by my fathers' industrial enemies in London who wished to discredit him, through me. It hasn't always been easy carrying the Jekyll name, you know. Great grandfather's legacy has followed all of his male heirs, down to, and including, me. - You were the most brilliant medical student at Oxford in many years, Jekyll. And many of us felt a great loss when you were expelled. Yes. Youthful exuberance, I'm afraid. And an exercise of extremely poor judgment. I was something of a hellion. Rich father and all. And I must confess that if it hadn't been for father's money, the criminal charges might not have been dropped. But as you say, that was 20 years ago. Hilda, Hilda? My sister Hilda has been hopelessly insane from birth. Yes, the lobotomy. McCallister at Harvard did it when she was 14. There, and there. Seemed to calm her madness. And then when father died, I brought her here to be with me. She seems happy enough, I suppose. Her duties seem important to her. Poor soul. Well you have clone right, Jekyll. Simple, satisfying work is the best therapy for the deranged. Yes. So, tell me. Tell me something of this new serum we've been hearing so much about at the university. Ah yes. As you know, Professor, I've developed a fine new cross breed of cattle here in America, yielding 30% more edible meat. My new bulls, however, are docile. They refuse to breed. - So the serum is a sex stimulant then? No. No, the sex stimulants alone are useless. When I worked on psychological warfare for the army, I developed a pituitary stimulant which released all of the latent aggressions buried deep in the unconscious mind. Then when this problem with the bulls arose, I could see a practical application of the serum. Along with, as you suggest, a powerful sex stimulant. Psychological warfare? Sounds very much like the work the Nazis were doing during the war. Indeed, Professor. In fact, the serum formula is derived from great grandfather Jekyll's original formula. It contains precisely the same elements. The Germans have been working on it since the early '30s. I have a film of our tests on human subjects, Professor. Human subjects? - It is a little gruesome, but perhaps- - You experiment on human beings? Killers, Professor. Convicted killers. Men facing the gallows, men with nothing to lose. Professor, lost persons. Those given a final opportunity to contribute something to science. - Well yes, I suppose there wouldn't be any harm in seeing your films. But my dear Professor. You were my first teacher. My respect for you mind must include my respect for your well being. It is late and you are tired. I suggest you go to bed. An excellent idea, Jekyll. But prepare yourself, Jekyll. I have many questions for you. And the first regarding Julia. He's here. Revenge is in my grasp. Where is Boris? What's taking him so long? Stupidity and incompetence surround me. It's about time, Boris. Now, to work. Boris, the lights. The lights, Boris! Boris. Get these shackles off. Remove the restraints, Boris. Over here. Tonight we will find out if the female subject kills more easily than the male. Is that right, old friend? Perhaps our fairer sex has had to repress more hatred. More pain, than their counterpart. That right, little sister? Hm? Have you had to bear more agony than I in your wretched young life, hm? You know, you're just like mother. That's why I hate you. You walk like her, you look like her, you even make me want you like her. That's the agony I've had to bear. You understand that, don't you? Watch. The subjects, they're coming to. Look. They see each other. All right. Notice how they concentrate and focus on each other. They don't even realize we are watching. Malo, Malo, put them out, Malo. Knock them out! Yes, Malo. If only our subjects had the same thirst for blood that you've got. You do your job well, my friend. You're a fine example of a psychotic killer. Why, Boris, I've been looking for you, old friend. What are you doing in here alone? With my Julia? Is it compassion you're feeling for her? Boris, compassion? Are you in love with my Julia, Boris? No. Is it love? Then what is it? You're concerned? You're concerned for her. Her bonds, her bonds are too tight? Feel them, Boris. Feel them. Are they too tight? Is she uncomfortable, Boris? Is that what makes you cry? Come with me, old friend. I know how you feel. I know just how you feel, old friend. Love is painful. Love is the most painful emotion of all. Yes, my friend. I know just how you feel. Love is painful. Get your hand back up there. You know better than that, Boris. Love is the most painful emotion of all. Boris! Boris! Professor? Come in, come in. Hilda, Brandy. - About Julia and the arrangements, I would very much like to see her- - We've planned the funeral for Tuesday. How soon may I see her? - You wouldn't want to see the body quite yet, Professor. Did you have a chance to see the estate? Indeed, I did, Jekyll. The countryside is exquisitely beautiful. Uh, have you seen the sunset, Henry? - Don't touch that curtain, Professor. Please, please, my eyes are extremely sensitive to the sunlight. I try to keep the curtains drawn during the day. It's a grave affliction. Something I've suffered with all my life. Can you imagine never seeing a sunset again, Professor? I am sorry to hear that. So, enough of me. Have you had a chance to see the bulls? Yes, the stock. I spent the afternoon in your pens. Some of the finest beef cattle I've ever laid eyes on. - Yes, yes, they're fine animals. But we haven't achieved perfection yet. The serum is quite effective in stimulating the breeding, Professor. Unfortunately the bulls, however, don't just stop with the breeding. They demonstrate a rather ugly tendency to kill the cows immediately after ejaculation. - What you're saying then, is that you cannot control the effects of your serum, is that it? - Precisely the point, Professor. Precisely. Sit down, please. While Boris prepares the film, I'll fill you in on our problem. You seem fascinated with Boris, Professor. Perhaps you recognize him. Recognize him? Indeed, Professor. The pitiful creature you see standing before you is none other than Boris Deveard Montenegro. Montenegro? Great Scott, Jekyll. He was cum laude at Oxford Medical the year you were expelled. West Indian, I believe. The very same, Professor. But why is he like th- - Boris was fascinated with my work. He followed me to Paris before the war, where we continued with my experiments. Other than Julia, Boris was the finest lab assistant I ever had. - Good lord, Jekyll, what happened to him? - Ah, Atkinson, we were young and very much enamored with the Parisian dance halls. One night after returning to the lab after too much wine, Boris drove us into a ravine. I was thrown clear. Boris went with the car. I managed to pull him from the flames and he survived, if you can call that survival. - Good god, Jekyll, does tragedy follow you everywhere? His brain was badly damaged, rendering him useless as a doctor. I've kept him on as a man servant. He can perform perfunctory tasks. - Well, I suppose better here than an asylum. Again, I find I must appreciate your compassion, doctor. You seemed to have taken on some heavy burdens. Ah, the film is ready. Hilda, the lights. Boris, start the film. - Now these two subjects are both volunteers from the state penitentiary. They're both killers. Coincidentally, they're both trained in the Oriental martial arts. Lending a certain color to the activity. Here, now. The serum, Professor, neutralizes both frontal lobes- This is appalling Jekyll. - Neutralizes both frontal lobes, where guilt, where conscience live- What are they doing? - The result is that- - What is this? - All hidden, all repressed aggressions- They're killing each other. Are free to be expressed. And all we have is the inner brain, or central nervous system to control the area. So we unfreeze that hatred and allow its expression, expression unhampered by troublesome guilt or understanding or forgiveness. It is released as pure rage. The subjects are getting even. Getting even for all the wrongs- This isn't the scientific- Including the agony of- - You're turning them into animals Jekyll. - You probably don't recall that incident, the profound enormity of the hatred that you felt for your father when he beat you or some wrong or other, but it is there, Atkinson. It is there and it will be until the clay you die. All the whippings for misconduct in childhood, all the denials and rejections of various needs from parents, teachers, other authorities. As it is in all children who are unable to justify such terrible wrongs done to them. These unjustified wrongs stay deep in the computer memory, or what we call the unconscious mind. They're animals. You've turned them. - Imagine, if you will, an army of enraged killers, righteous killers. Killers who need no moral justification for their deeds, whatsoever. - What's happened to you, Jekyll? What's happened to you? - No moral incentive instruction. Sickness. No moral questions in battle. The French all lost their war in lndo China, Professor. I could have won it for them. Oh my god, this is awful. Revolting. There, there. Another curious side effect of the drug is its capacity to numb pain. As such like morphine and heroine. It's addictive. I think, Professor, that herein lies the problem, the answer to the problem we discussed earlier, the control factor. If I can control the dosage, so as to counter the rage with the awful need of withdrawal. Then I believe I could keep the subjects in a constant state of anxiety. They will follow me then on command. Like Pavlov's dog. Hilda, the lights. And do you follow my logic, Professor? - That is the most grotesque, the most obscene thing I've seen in my life. - Professor Atkinson, I need your help. I need your expertise in the behavioral sciences. Don't you understand? - My expertise is involved in the behavior of human beings, not their destruction. I cannot see how I can help you in the least. Animals are one thing. - Well there are similarities, Professor. - There are no similarities whatsoever, my clear Jekyll, between cows and men. Now if you will excuse me, I would like to retire to my room, I have some thinking to do. And I would like to discuss those thoughts with you at some length, Dr. Jekyll. At some length! - Yes, my dear colleague and teacher. We will discuss these issues at length. At great length. Julia. Julia. Julia, your father is here. Father. Your father is here. In the house, Julia. Does he...does he know? Yes, yes. I told him you were here. I told him you were here, Julia. I told him you were dead. Your father's here from London for your funeral. For your funeral, he's here for your funeral. No. Yes. So still you reject me! No. Yes. Why, Professor. What are you doing out here at this late hour? Come, let me walk you. I want you to see my chamber, Professor. But at a more suitable time. - Jekyll, there's definitely something going on in this house. I don't know what it is, but whatever it is- It is fatigue, and your grief. They're playing tricks with your mind. Come now, try to get some sleep. I'd like to talk this out in the morning, Professor. Can you find your way in the dark? Be careful, Professor. That was your father, Julia. Right outside the door. So close. And yet so far. Now, my love. Bed, then unite our love. Boris, get this fire going. It is freezing. Jekyll, where have you been? I want to see Julia's body and make the final arrangements. Yes, yes, Professor. So many things on my mind. Tomorrow, first thing in the morning. What's that you've got there? Disgusting. I won't have this trash in my house. I will not have it in my house. - Jekyll, I wanted to ask you about last night. I thought I heard screams, the most agonizing shrieking. On the night before last, I could have sworn I heard a scream. It was. I heard nothing but you outside my door last night, Professor. Boris? Boris, did you hear anything unusual in the night last night? Hilda, dear, did you hear any sounds last night? You've been having nightmares, Professor. I have a powerful sedative which will help you sleep much, much more soundly. No, no, don't doctor. It was a nightmare, but I could've swore. It was a nightmare. - Professor Atkinson, please, sit down. I hesitate to say what I'm about to say, Professor Atkinson. I know your feelings regarding human experimentation. I must tell you, however, that with permission of local police authorities, we are using human subjects here in the laboratory. They've even provided us with the volunteers. Men facing execution who, if they survive the testing, are promised parole after their convalescence. L thought it, Mr. Jekyll. I only hope to god Julia wasn't exposed to such barbarism. That is what I wanted to speak to you about. What were exactly Julia's duties? Did she have anything to do with this? - Julia, Julia was a scientist, Professor. Julia understood the necessity of human testing to develop the serum formula. I think it would please you to know that she did everything possible to provide comfort for the volunteers. - I don't think I can accept that, Dr. Jekyll. Come, come, Professor. We're both professional men. Sit down. I want you to join me tonight for a demonstration of the formula. I think the dosage is finally correct. There will of course be a prison guard present to witness the testing and provide for our security. I think you'll be surprised. I think you'll gain insight and understanding of my work. No, I simply can't. I already know more than I care to know about your work. Of course you can! Professor Atkinson, I would consider it an honor. No, I will have no part in it. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'd like to go for a walk. But, I insist, Henry Jekyll, that you allow me to Julia first thing in the morning. - Oh you'll see her, all right, Atkinson. But it won't be quite what you expect. Hilda, Brandy. Ice. I said ice, Hilda. You do know what ice is, don't you, my dear? This is ice. Ice. Ice. Ice. Ice. Ice. Ice! Julia. Love me. Love me, Julia. Love me. Whatever it might take, my Julia. Love me, Julia. I fear Jekyll has changed for the worse. I don't believe a word he says. I know he's up to something. Oh, Julia. I love you. I worship you, Julia. Julia, I adore you. Oh, take me. Take me. Let- Hilda? Is that you, Hilda? Were you watching us, my dear? Then why are you back here in the shadows, my dear? Watch. Look. Come closer, my love. Come closer and see what it is we do. Look. Look at her. Closer. Look at her, Hilda. Isn't she beautiful? Think about how beautiful she is. And how ugly and scarred you are. Watch. Watch us make love. Watch us, Hilda. Why won't he let me see Julia? My god, there is madness in this house! - What are you blubbering about, you simpleton? Are you afraid I might hurt your lovely Julia? She hates you. She hates you even more than I hate you. You understand that? Do you understand that, you fool? Julia! Julia, you're alive. Boris! You fiend! Jekyll, what are you doing to my daughter? Take her down, leave her alone. - We were planning a more formal reunion with your lovely daughter. You fiend, Jekyll. You monster. - So, you wouldn't watch my experiments. Well now you must. Look. Julia. Get him out of my sight. Get him down to the laboratory and restrain him. Sleep well, Atkinson. Sleep well. Sleep well. Take it. Take it. Julia, take me. I want you. Love me. I think you'll enjoy tonight's entertainment, Professor. A man and a woman. Battle of the sexes, if you will. You are a fiend, Jekyll. Just like your infamous great grandfather, a fiend. Nonsense, Atkinson. These subjects are guilty of rape and murder. The French would have put them to the guillotine. The Germans would have taken them out and shot them. If I hadn't had them in my experiments, they would have died in the gas chamber. Boris, the lights. Boris! Lights! I at least give the poor devils an opportunity to earn their freedom. Perhaps even contribute something to humanity. Fiendish, Atkinson? Hardly. Hardly. These subjects have been heavily sedated for some time, Atkinson. Once the serum is injected, the subject will come quite rapidly to consciousness. She will experience confusion, disorientation, and paranoia. Then, Atkinson, when the serum reaches the central nervous system, it triggers an immediate release of the rage. There, there, look, look, she's coming around. Madness, Jekyll. Pure madness! - The purpose tonight, Atkinson, is to determine whether or not the subject with the serum, the woman, can prevail over the stronger subject without the serum, the man. Look, she sees him, she sees him. Watch. I won't watch. Don't make me watch, I won't watch. Jekyll you're an- Watch, Atkinson. Watch! See her. See, look, watch. Look, look, look. For god sake, Jekyll, stop it. Look at the motor reflexes. See the coefficients. I won't watch. Watch her, Atkinson, watch! Watch, look at her eyes. See her eyes, see her eyes. Look, look. - You're turning them into animals, Jekyll. - See? - They'll kill each other. Whoa, oh, no! My god, Jekyll. She might have killed you. Yes. - Is this the face of the winner? Is this their reward? Do you always kill the survivor? - That is precisely the point, Atkinson. That's why you're here. Once the serum is injected, the rage can't be controlled. The subject can't stop killing. Don't you understand this? I need your help. I need your help, Atkinson. I'm at an end, I can't go on without you. Never. Never, never will I be part of such brutality. We are in it together. Together. Together we can do this. We can solve this. - You are insane. You're a raging psychopath! You're a madman. " Mad? Perhaps, Atkinson. But we both know, don't we, that genius is born of madness. Don't we? My genius might be flawed. I need your help. I can't go on without your assistance. Please. - I'll see you in hell first! - Hell might be closer than you think, Atkinson. Hell might be closer than you think. You might think of hell, Atkinson, in terms of the lovely Julia tearing the throat out of an adversary here in the arena. Naked. Slobbering. Growling like a bitch wolf protecting her cubs. Unless you assist me, Atkinson, that is the hell that awaits you. Sleep now, Atkinson. Sleep. Dream of your own private, raging hell. Boris. Boris, get in here. Get in here. Get him out of here. Get him out of here and get this mess cleaned up. Boris? Boris? I said, Boris. Get him out of here! And get this place cleaned up. Ah, the good Professor Atkinson. Did you sleep well, my friend? I told you my sedatives were strong. - May you rot in hell, Henry Jekyll. - I've already been to hell, Atkinson. Put there by people just like you. - What have you done to Julia, damn you, what have you done to her? Yes. The lovely Julia. For what is it to be, Atkinson? Will you assist me? Or will it be the lovely Julia in the arena? You are a mad man, Jekyll. I can't reason with a mad man. I have no choice. I'll help you, may god forgive me. - I thought you'd see it my way, Atkinson. You have no need for this. Oh by the way, Professor. God may not forgive you, but Julia will. Julia. Your father doesn't approve of my experiments, Julia. Does that surprise you? Listen, Jekyll. If I do everything you want, will you let go of my father? You'd do this for your father? To save your father? You'll love me? Will you love me? Will you help me with the experiments? Will ya? - Yes. - Will you work in the lab with me? Will ya? - Yeah. Will you love me? Will you love me? Will you take me? Say it. Yes. Say I love you. Say it. Say it. Say it. L.- Say it. Say it and I won't hurt your father. I love you. Say it. I love you. Will you take me? Hilda? Hilda. Listen to me, Hilda. Say I love you. Say I love you, Julia. Say I love you. Say I love you. - I love you. Say I like it and I love you. Say it. I like it. - You must help us escape from this monster. He will, your brother is insane, he will kill us all. You are the only hope left. Take the message, Hilda. Take it. Take it, give it to the man who brings food. Do you understand, Hilda? Give it to the man who brings food. And be careful. Be very careful. Get in here. Betray me, hm? Did you betray me? Get down. Get down. Get up. Listen to me. Listen to me. You turn me in to the authorities, turn me in to the authorities. Ruin my work, ruin my work, Hilda? Ruin everything I've done? I'm the one who's taken care of you for the last 20 years. Get down. You're the one who loves me. I'm your love, me! I'm the one you love. This is love. God, help us all. - I'm the one who's taken care of you for 20 years. You served me for 20 years, little sister. Now let me serve you. Julia. Julia. I love you. I love you. I do these things because I love you. Listen, listen to me Julia, listen. Listen. I want you to marry me. I want you to be my bride, my bride. Julia, I want you. I want you to be my bride. Julia! Stop it. Julia. Oh please, Julia. Don't turn away. Julia. I want you to be my wife. I want you. This is my mother's ring! My darling Julia continues to reject me. Tonight I offered her my life. My own dear little sister was prepared to betray me to the authorities. I was convinced I'd entirely severed both frontal lobes. All has gone wrong. All except for my work. And I feel strongly that success is at hand this very night. Dr. Jekyll? " Yes, yes. - I'm Officer Maloney of the San Francisco Police Department. May I come in? - Yes, of course, Officer Maloney. - We've received reports of gunshots in the vicinity. Could you tell me, have you seen or heard anything out of the ordinary in the past few weeks? - Uh no, no sir, I've seen nothing or heard nothing like that, I'm sorry. Undoubtedly you've heard of the kidnappings. No, sir, I- - Witnesses have described the suspect. He looks something like this. Have you seen this man, doctor? - No, I don't know who that person is, officer, I'm sorry. Keep the picture, doctor. Show it to your servants. Perhaps they may have seen the man. - Well I'm alone in the house, Officer Maloney. Yes, I'll keep the picture. Thank you, doctor. I won't take up anymore of your time. What was that? I thought you were alone? - Officer, my sister is staying with us for these few weeks that she's ill. - Oh I'm sorry to hear that, doctor. I won't bother you anymore, good night. Good night, Officer Maloney. Boris! Boris! Where have you been, you incompetent idiot? Get in here. The new serum, Boris, the new serum. We must have success tonight. Take it. Take it! Tonight, tonight. This is the one, my dear. This is finally the one. I feel it. The formula is right. I feel it. Yes. Yes. Good, good. Now get me that lab equipment I showed you. The lab equipment I showed you. The male subject, Boris. Bring in the male subject. Good, good. Bring him in. Place him next to the female subject. Closer, good, Boris. Bring him in. Good, closer. Closer to the female subject. Now place the male subject, Boris. Put him down. They're coming around. Now we shall see. Now we shall see. Kill him, Malo, kill him! Shoot him now. Failure. But I will continue. I will continue with my experiments. I must continue. The world is waiting for me. Waiting for my genius. My genius, Boris. My creativity. My contribution- - Jekyll listen to me, listen to me. The world has passed you by. Nobody wants you. Nobody's waiting for your contribution. You have no contribution to make. You're not a genius, Jekyll, you're a small man living in the shadow of an insane ancestor. The truth is that you are a fraud. I never believed your fantastic lies. It's just you Jekyll who turned your sister and friend into pitiful zombies. - You shut up, you shut up. Stop. - I'll never assist you in this madness, Jekyll. I fear you no longer. I don't care what you do. - You fear me no longer, Atkinson? Oh perhaps, perhaps you fear this. Boris, Boris, stop! Boris. Boris! Boris! Boris, Boris. It starts so fast. So much faster than I thought. The pain. I've won, Atkinson. I've won. I've won. I've won, Atkinson. I've won! Listen to me, listen to me, Atkinson. I won. My serum is a success. I was right. You were wrong. I was right! You were wrong. I won. I won. I won! Hilda, I've won. I've won, Hilda! Oh god. I won!
