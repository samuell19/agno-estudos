Look man, I'm a say this shit one time and one time only. If you ain't ready to kill no nigga that's in the way, then you ain't got no business here. It's a new order business and play that's gonna get everybody paid. And by that, I mean, over the next six months. Seem like them people trying to develop a case on me for homicide. What homicide? Take your pick. So you know if they lookin' for me, they damn sure gonna come lookin' for you. We need to get these lawyer fees workin'. Before the first line up, before indictment paper hit the grand jury, before a bitch nigga feel like they wanna tell somethin'. We gotta flood the city with this diesel, man. That white boy out here makin' a whole lot of money. Ain't nobody out here sellin' dope by the pound, and ain't gotta warehouse full of that shit. White boys say that shit pure. Pure as fuck. True as fuck. Then what you gonna take him down for? You're just as good as your connect when you selling dope. The fuck? Y'all ain't got shit else better to fuckin' do? The fuck off me, punk!

And we got 72 hours before that battery down their tracking device. I'm gonna take the next 48 hours to set up shop. That's Inglewood, the low end and the 100s. We gonna set up lines. Real motherfucking quiet Overnight, when the whole city sleep. Police ain't kicking in no doors at 3:00 AM. Them vulture hours. They know some hot shit gonna be waiting for 'em. Man, them jump out boys still active. And them little shorties, they still doing dumb shit after hours. Most them still holding out these blocks we taking over with them lines, so ain't no conversation be steppin'- So what about out west then? Man that shit'll move crazy on the 290. And there's already some niggas out there that I know. It ain't nothing to move on them niggas. It's the little niggas at war that's gonna cause all that undue heat. They still into that beef, and over a nigga rap song. You think we gonna set up moves up in the wood? Then what the fuck's gonna happen? These ain't them fucking projects. Can't hit them stairs and have 100 apartments to choose from every time them people hit. Y'all talkin' bout niggas. And y'all talkin' bout police. Man, fuck that. I want this money. You just let me know where you need us to set up at, and me and V Dubb gonna clear that shit out before anybody know we coming. Somebody brought some nuts to the conversation. Bow wow. Move your car. All right, gangster, come on in and have a seat. So how you know my street name? Well. Okay. Charged in 2005 with an assault, using hammer over the head of Corey Jackson.

We could talk about the past, we could talk about law, and we could talk about business. I prefer to talk about law and business. I'm not oblivious as to who you are or what you do. That's your business. By contracting me, we're gonna have one thing in common, and that's your freedom. So what's the ticket? Right now you don't have any warrants. District one homicide has filed a petition with the state's attorney based on a statement given by a witness. What witness? When I know, you'll know. Look, Mr. Steele, you're not in a presence of a basic attorney. I'm a former prosecutor. Hm, so you plugged, huh? With electricity in my veins for 37 years. So what's the ticket? It's gonna cost you 20K to retain my services. 20,000, huh? Mm-hm. How bout 25? We'll get what we need to know about that witness. Eh, here we go. You get this. See what I mean? Close the door, huh?

You had a nice little run, didn't you? You know, I should have smacked you across the head with this motherfucking pistol. You didn't think there was no more vultures out here, did you? You know, this thing had about 500,000 on that table in that crib. But we ain't find no dope. And that's some good ass dope. Where the rest of it at?

'Cause that's what the fuck vultures do! That's what I'm talking about! Aye! You was on that boat with me, no business. - Did you see it? - Shaking her ass. Who the plug now? Fuck we talking about, man. Can't get comfortable, man. Can't get comfortable. That three can be flipped to 30, and that 30 show can make 100. Stay focused. These streets gonna talk. Don't nothing make noise in these streets like good dope. Them white boys, they gonna jump on the E-way and they gonna come and get it. A few of them motherfuckers might even know D. Gonna be hot as hell in these streets. Let's keep that third eye open. Real gangsters move in silence. And we done hit up plenty motherfuckers. And they gonna definitely want they lick back. So we gotta hit they ass first, right? Truth be told. Well let's get this money. Let's get some real money. Let's keep them five P's in play. Don't be posting shit on social media. Don't be sitting in them motherfuckin' cars, and most upon of all, like G said, don't get too comfortable. The hell wrong with you, boy? Why is this shit all over the floor? Why this ain't boxed up? Where's your mama? Don't turn your God damn head away from me when I'm talking to you. Where's your mama? I don't know, Dad. She left in somebody else's car last night. She left in somebody else's car? Where's I don't know. Anybody. Help us! Is anybody here? Somebody please. It's okay. Is anybody here? Is anybody here? Yo. Yo, what's up, what's up, bro? Real, T.

All right. Black gold, Gooch. That's what it is. Get this money. We taking over the motherfucking city. Man, it's the world. What took you so long to answer the door? Because you banging on the door like you the police. Can you sit down? Today, just without the bad talk. Take these. Tie 'em up. I'm gonna come right back. Can you do that? - Yeah I can do it. - Without the damn back talk? Damn. Hey bro, check it out. We got some more cars coming through. Come on, bro, come on. Here, man. I had to break the bank for this one. What I tell you about bringing me loose change? Come on, man. All spend the same, man. It's just change, man. Got a car coming, bro. Bet. Hey, man, let's go back here. Cars coming through. Hey man, why you got the motherfucking dope? Oh. No, no, no, please don't. Please, baby, no, please. When my spot stop making money, It's only right I find out where the action going. Vulture packs. I see they even got they own slogan. Vulture packs. Please don't, please don't do this. The only way to fly. I'm gonna make sure both of y'alls get y'all wings today. That nigga ain't loyal to nobody. He weak. Let a young bitch take him completely off his square. I told his ass, we don't kill the folks, and we damn sure don't fuck over nigga's family. He did both when he pulled that shit on you. You was with him on that bullshit. Prove it, nigga. I'm one of Chief's finest. I kill ops, not the folks. True enough, I trust him with my life on too many moves. Had me in a ambush with the Mexicans. He didn't give a fuck how I felt. You think I'll be over here pouring out information, like y'all don't got shit else to do. No, I want what's mine. And that nigga got it. He got it, huh? We staying for 30 pounds of heroin. I put in the most work on that move. To leave with a pound of 10 bands like I'm a motherfucking worker. How I know, you ain't one of them niggas that killed my people? And just trying to set up a move to have me buried next to my BM? 'Cause I done already knocked off this bitch. She was named dropping. Holding too much information. Fucked around with a turned state witness. So I put a bullet in the bitch. I just made sure I fucked her first. Nigga was too pussy whipped to address what I told him the problem was, so I handled that shit accordingly. You don't gotta with me a day in life after this. I'm telling you how to get your get back. You won't find a more reliable source. This from the horse's mouth. You could take it or you can leave. I want his location. I want 50 bands. I get a new crib location and a warehouse. You just hit me once you come up. How about we lay your ass down right now for being suspect? And I'll find that warehouse myself. Sound like two for one to me. Your mama still live on Woodlawn, nigga? You need to check up on her more often. I ain't playing no stupid game to win no stupid prize. I'm bringing you sugar. Don't return a favor by handing me no shit. We can get money, or we can get greasy. 50 bands off the vault in that warehouse. How much in there? Close to a million. Yo nigga socked you up pretty bad, huh? Where you from? Dad, is mom coming back? I don't know. But you ain't gonna lose no sleep over it. Same routine, same responsibilities, same curfew. Now you hold your head up. Whatever crying you gonna do, you gonna squeeze that shit up out you right now. Look, listen, learn. There's a lesson in everything you encounter, but nothing in life is gonna teach you like love. It's gonna give you the biggest smile and the worst pain. It's good to experience it now, instead of having it shell shock you later on. But one thing I don't want you getting accustomed to, and that's living in mystery over some God damn woman. It's all right to love, but when love causes you to lose yourself, you better let that bitch go. And I don't care who she is. Do we have an understanding? Yes sir. I'll be picking you up from school. You got your cell phone? Yes. Make sure it's off in class. Power on at 2:15, I'll be texting you. All right. Bring it here. Go on upstairs. Get ready for tomorrow. Watch your step. My clients come from all over. Japan, Bangladesh, South Africa, Sudan. They receive a five star experience from a McCarran Airport to our hotel. Most of the Johns, they pick up their favorite girl, then they go to the strip club, then the pot dealer. But my exclusives, they want cane, powder, and pills, and their fair share of pussy. Rich, powerful men, and it all boils down to pussy. You put a cute girl on their arm and they're willing to spend it all. You'd do great there. Jake, managing your father's bank is enough for me. By enough, you mean earning a salary? Honey, you haven't seen bank until you play in a circle of billionaires. Think about it. How much longer on your friend? She's on the elevator. Splendid. The door. Jake, she's here. Well, whoopdie-fucking-do. You always show up to your business meetings 30 minutes late? You wanted the best in the city. Best things come with a little wait. Or I could have had you to pull up in Murder Town and met with one of the other workers. Murder Town. No, that wouldn't work. I mean, I'm not from Chicago, but I know I don't want to be going to Murder Town. If you got some of that stuff from yesterday, come on, show it to me. Let's go. Mike, this is, uh. Call me, Tiff. Come on ladies, sit down. And this is the same from the little bird on the bag that I snorted yesterday? Straight from the source. That's 25,000 in your hand. Mike, get the 25,000 out of the bag next to the bed. Today, Mike. This is 25,000 hand over fist, okay? And this package, this'll be traveling with me. I don't deal with narcotics, but having quantities like this is paramount. I have patrons and I need to keep them happy. Where at? Fabulous Las Vegas, of course. That's over 2000 miles away. Honey, we're not talking miles. We're talking money. Keisha's gonna give you my number. So I'm gonna talk to the team. Thanks for the plug. This is some real boss shit. Motherfucker, think you gonna- I think you broke my nose! Broke out of my house! Don't kick me out! Bitch, quit your shit, G! Come on, mama. Get the fuck out my house, G. You think this shit make you responsible? Or make. Hey, hey, on that car, gang. Nigga, almost put this whole clip in this bitch. You must got good life insurance, nigga. Nah, it ain't even that, big bro. It's we into it right now. And you still ain't getting no money. Shit, you know how that go. PPP done shut everything down. We out here hitting cars and knocking over stores. Big Bitch Betsy gonna make sure I eat though, by any means. You wanna make some real money? Fuck yeah, nigga. Grab a couple of them that you fuck with. Y'all hop in the back. You know we got these blicks on us. Bring her with you. And come on, y'all. I need at least 2000 damn bags by the end of this shift. Yo, what is y'all doing? We need to speed it up. We gotta a line and more cars pulling up. If you want something done right, you should do it yourself then. Up with all that? Y'all heard that man. Melo, take your way outside and secure the alley. I ain't got no pistol, man. Tell TY he relieved and grab his gun. I'll be out there in a minute. Aye yo, Ty, you can spin off, G. Y'all always need to speed it up. Y'all ain't moving fast enough. I know, man. Let's go, y'all. Aye yo, Ty. The fuck is wrong with you? Get down! It's cool. Don't move. Somebody help this man! Hey, hey, hey. Somebody help, somebody help! Cedric thanks you. Pops was the only father figure I knew. You know, it's been so many years since I've seen any of you young men from the community center. Besides those that turned into my children. Ever since law enforcement swept through our neighborhoods, we lost the glue and structure that made us a good community. Our vision was in place. Our direction was set. Cedric, myself and so many others, there was hundreds of us. We were determined to erase the stain that crack inflicted on our community. But we were not prepared to face the government that wanted to keep us there. We were on the brink of a mass incarceration that caused more detriment to our families than ever. But worse is, those of you who knew the guidelines to our recovery and didn't fulfill the commitment to become leaders. The leaders that our organization so desperately needed. I was 17 when them indictments took place, and not all of us had leadership capabilities. Think about most of our members coming from broken homes and shit. We looked up to the guys. When pops went down, I ain't had nothing my mind but trying to survive. And becoming a father, made me put a bigger priority on survival. By committing the same acts that has my husband doing life in the institution? Fucking snake, man. That's what I'm saying, man. You already know. Aye man, somebody at your door, man. Man, fuck that. - Put your hands up! - Get on the ground! - Get down! - Down! 15 Years ago, Cedric spent every conversation mentioning you. I had forgotten who you were until recently. Now I recall, you the young kid that he allowed to live in our attic. My moms had drug problems. I remember him spending several hours with you in that attic, teaching you the literature. The positive dignified principles of growth and development. Why you call me over here? I mean, everybody dead. I pay my ho mm age, and I don't see none of these out in the street taking initiative to send a old man no money. Not a dime. We don't want your money. Well, all right then. Get your coat, man. Send my love to him. We want your involvement. You have influence. You have the knowledge and the ability to continue this mission that is far from over. Look at the men who follow you. They follow because of what you know and what you're able to accomplish. I got accomplished being a single father to a eight year boy. My time to try to influence a bunch of niggas to see a better way is the quickest way for me to end up in a penitentiary. Just like pops and the rest of them old heads. If the streets don't kill you first. We all got a out date, now don't we? Try telling him that. What's his future without you? Who does he have? As a father, you're not in a position to be selfish. But I'm in a good position to be smart now, ain't I? Very well then. Yeah. I got cash for you, bro. I gotta go to Stash house and grab a few things. Maybe you can meet me over. And I got a buzz to put in your ear. All right. About a new business opportunity. Aight, shit, listen. Stop disrespecting me, stop disrespecting me, stop disrespecting! You will stop disrespecting me! You will stop disrespecting me! I didn't do it to you! Where K at? She done left the crib a long time ago and never came back. You know Kayla don't fuck with me. Last time I seen her, she was picking up my baby from the hospital. Boy, you know you look just like your granddaddy, just like him, with a little bit of your daddy in there, too. You know, I find it funny that she been gone all this time and ain't paid you not one visit. That shit don't even surprise me though. She'd ran off and left only child just like you left her. Whole rotten ass apples don't fall too far from the tree. Rotten apples? You got a lot of nerve. You do not know my struggle and you definitely don't know my pain. I don't know about you running behind all the more dirty ass hustlers to the point where you allowed them to take advantage of your only God damn daughter. You don't know shit! Get your mother, this motherfucker! I tried to raise Kayla the best I could. By myself, me. I couldn't save her. Shit, I couldn't even save myself. My baby has so much talent. She could sing, she could dance. Smart. I couldn't give her her dreams when I was living in my own nightmare. So I had to give her up. So I guess that's why she ended up with you. And then she told me she was pregnant, and I was happy for her. 'Cause she was happy. So if came over here to judge me, you picked the wrong day to do it. I came over here to make a discovery. Maliq need to be in tune with his family. Least the little bit he do got. Especially his grandma. Now I know you over here fucked up, but it ain't my place to deprive him of a relationship he should have. There's enough shit going on already. You wanna spend some time with your grandma? Yeah. Make sure you put some food in your refrigerator. I'm gonna come back over and pick him up later. Of the heaviest stuff really getting going. Now through midnight, we could have some heavy bands of snow, especially for areas near- I was instructed to make sure you received it. If you have any love for my husband, you'll hear him out. From the north, moisture coming in from the south. That's why we're just at the beginning stages of this snow storm, another storm warning in effect. Let's talk about what you can expect for the next six hours when we expect some of the heavy stuff to fall. Here's Rob- It's been 20 long years since we spoke. The chaos that has the streets of Chicago in a hellish state is a direct result of our actions. Gonna change direction, become more of a west or northwest- It's the offspring from the life we live, reproduced on the same blocks that we govern. So much of that blood is on our hands. - Now. - Mm-hm. Now that's gangsta. - Yeah. - Say less. We headed to the warehouse right now. I got Soda on it to the stash stop. We inside. On my way. Time is up, OG. What the fuck y'all little niggas doing in here? My mama told me about your ass, nigga. And she told you I ain't nothing to fuck with. As I think back, I could have did things a whole lot better. There's plenty of room in here for the lost and misguided, but a shame for a man who possessed the keys of prosperity to be in here next to me. And I want you to think about that. But we don't get a chance to rewrite history, but we do get a chance to build a more promising future. Every dog ass nigga got their day. You don't wanna do that, Ritchie. You hold the answers. The blueprint to the change that our community so desperately need. This ain't how it's supposed to go down. A man can't live by bread alone. You just gonna do this to me, nigga? All you niggas? I'm a fucking vulture, too. I put in work and fed a lot of you niggas, man. Vulture City for life, right? Your Pop's gonna be proud of you, boy. Be sure you tell your Mama I'm a send that care package to him in the morning, aight? Hello? Yeah, he just left. He took Maliq with him. Welcome home, G. What's his future without you? No, no! You're under arrest for the murder of Robert Ratford, AKA, Joe. Anything you say can and will be used against you. We could choose our actions, but we can't choose our consequences. I want you to think about that. Looking forward to seeing Maliq someday. I know he has in him, what you have in you. And for the sake of the next generation to come, your son's generation, somebody has to stop the bleeding.
