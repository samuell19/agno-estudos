Why do they always dress people in black at funerals and graduations? Both days are the end of something. Is this a uniform for the soon-to-be unemployed? Are you embarrassed to graduate after 4 years of nothing but playing? Don’t say that. You played harder than anyone else. Yoon Hye Ji! Aren’t you even coming to your own graduation? Geez… You're so frustrating. Theater and film students aren’t supposed to go to school very often. You’re coming, right? Are you in a cab right now? You should all come here too The masseur here's great. It’s a hundred times better than getting your graduation certificate. We should take a photo of the 4 of us! Don't be so corny. Just come to the beauty salon. It's time for a make-over. We're already fully made-up. We're all new women now. To think that my friends only get their make-up once a day. I made reservations for all of us Get over here right now. Anyone can make reservations. I heard a guy you know owns the place, so you get a 90% discount. It's a little tacky of you. Let's go to a club tonight. Each of you, pick a guy. I’ll go chat him up and make sure you get a taste of him immediately. So hurry up and get over here! (LITTLE BLACK DRESS) (Yoon Eun Hye) (Park Han Byul) (Yoo In Na) (Cha Ye Ryun) Happy graduation! Come on! Let’s go! (10 months later) The dark baseball player? Or the short exchange student? I think it's the pale model with long legs. But he's not all that in broad daylight. Why do I even bother worrying about you? Hey. They’ve started throwing up now Where am I? At your place. What’s the date today? It's November 11th. Are you all right? Oh no! Geez! Are you back from the dead now? No. I was in the tub but the bubbles reminded me of cocktails, so I threw up again. Buy yourself a car. Your house is so far away. Don't worry, I took a taxi. A private taxi. Did your parents arrange another job interview for you? My mom’s calling. Bye! The next station is Mok Dong, Mok Dong. I'm as lazy as a person can get. Why did I bother to graduate so early? I'm running out of excuses now too. (Today's our 1,000th day anniversary. I miss kissing you in the empty lecture hall.) (I'll wait at the playground near your house – Soo Hwan.) You're here. We haven't done it in ages. I mean… I haven't seen you in ages. How have you been? Here… Let's stop this. We already broke up. What I mean is, we already broke up so let's stop meeting like this. Why? Do you think you can meet a successful guy and marry him? I just want to focus more on myself. Focus? I went out with you for 3 years. I’ve never seen you focus on anything besides shopping. Even if we went to a motel close by. You always had to You always had to take a private taxi and You never drank anything besides Starbucks or Coffee Bean! What do you want from me? Every time we went to a motel, you'd look at my wallet. Every time I drank coffee, you’d say it was more expensive than eating a meal. Above all… How could you take me to eat cheap burgers on my birthday? I’m a university graduate now! How can you expect me to still love you? 1,000 days ago I was nervous that he wouldn't ask me out. Today I was nervous that he wouldn't let me go. I love dating younger guys too but I don't think we belong here. Let's go study overseas. Go on, sit down. It's the VIP seat. That's your seat, sit down. Do you have to seduce junior high students to get a visa these days? I’m going to go overseas before my parents get divorced. You’re going to help me, right? This is yours! You have no idea, do you? If you want to study, the first step is to stop hanging out with me. I'm going. Hye Ji! Hey! I’m going, bye! I’ll give you my bag! Hey! I’ll really give it to you! Come on! (We regretfully inform that you were not cast in the film, ‘Perfect Couple'.) You seem a little distracted. I received a text message from the lab. BA Psychology at Seoul National University. After graduating, in the first semester of your masters… You seem to have studied quite diligently. You went to a good school too. Have we met somewhere before? No. I don't really have much confidence in you. But I'll give you a chance. It's all right, please remain seated. Tae-hui really loves her candy. Dad, here… Does she have potential? She still has a year left until the next university entrance exams. That's plenty of time. You don't have to rush. It's not easy to foster a genius. I'm willing to support her 2 more times. I see. I will fully support her through 5 entrance exams. I'll work really hard this time. I’ll make sure I get into university the 3rd time around, dad. I have so much faith in her. Some kids are interested in arts and sports. They just use their bodies. I hate that. They don't even want to go to university. (My only friend who has a full-time job! How's work? I'm at a stupid job interview – Yoo Min.) Are you Lee Yoo Min? It's okay, sit down. You're not as ugly as I expected. Are you close to Director Jang? Excuse me? The person who referred you to me. Yes, well… Tell her if she turns down my drama for that film, I'll never cast her again. The film's her Hollywood debut feature. Her manager says she won't be acting in Korea anyway. As if she could get work in Hollywood. She can't even speak English. I heard she studied abroad. Just go outside and work, okay? Go now. Hurry! Hurry! Where are you looking? Eyes on me. Yes. I don't really know Director Jang very well. Goodness… You're really something. Excuse me? Thousands of girls would kill for this chance Don't pretend to play fair. - Are you going to the sauna? - Excuse me? To go scrub yourself? Why are you dressed like that? I was told to wear a tracksuit. Even so, what gave you the nerve to actually, come dressed like that? It wasn't just because I was told to. I want to be a writer. I can’t come here and write wearing a suit. Assistant writers don't need to write. Why don’t assistant writers..? I don’t care if you have zero imagination I want someone who's all action. Someone who can cast well and conduct good interviews and prepare research. Actually… You don’t really fit in here… Okay, come to work tomorrow. Go to the department store right now and buy yourself something nice. Excuse me, but… You’re pretty. If you dress up, it will be easy to get people to talk to you. And eyes on me all the time. Look at me. Hey. Good, you're here. Because you told me I had to come here. I have to tell you something. I feel nervous now. There's a blind date today. Who is it? - Not me, you. - What? I was supposed to tell you a week ago but I forgot. I’m a mess. Does it have to be today? We can go shopping now. I have to buy shoes too. Wear mine. We're the same size. These are brand new. Can’t you just cancel it? He's just a friend. You're totally his type. He saw your photo on my website and asked me to introduce you. Who bothers to look at websites? The photo from Min Hee's birthday party. You know which one it is, right? That girl isn't me. She disappeared that night. Don't worry. I'll make sure she returns. His grandfather’s really famous He's loaded in cash. And… He’s 29. That’s okay, right? I hope his maturity level is 29 too. Don't even dream of that. The male mind stops developing at 17. What school? Hyundai High, then he went to New York. He's going to take over his dad's company. How tall is he? Around six feet? But all guys add a few inches to their height… Probably around 5’ 9’’ or 5’ 10’’ then What should I wear? I think we are both looking at the same thing right now. It reminds me of the freshman party. That was a terrible night. I've bought 9 in total since that night. Make it 10 then. This one's really different. Yes, it is. It's perfect for blind dates and other occasions. It's great for weddings and funerals too. The back is nice too. Men will follow you. That’s right. How was the interview? Are you going to work there? Took you long enough to ask. Out? No. I don't have any other choice. Single payment, please. I'm telling you it's just vanity. How is Soo Jin working at a company being vain? Just think about it. She's well off, but works hard. How is that not being vain? What? If a girl who can support herself takes a job at a company. Some poor person is going to end up being unemployed. Is that why you’ve never worked? I'm just doing my part to help society. But Soo Jin got a job, gave up acting worked hard to meet the qualifications. She has a dream. What’s the point in that? You work because you have to, then you start adding meaning into it. If Soo Jin was here, you’d be pulling each other's hair out. Geez. Hye Ji! You kept us waiting. The traffic's terrible today. It's all right, stop it. Wow! You look exactly the same as your photo. I’m Lee Seok Won. Are you Lee Yoo Min? Yes. You’re the same age as Hye Ji… 24? Yes, I graduated this year. Stop talking down to her. You can talk down to him too later. Hey… I'll just talk down to him now. If you majored in theater and film… Are you going to be an actress? Do all athletes win gold medals? Why don’t you leave so we can talk? Don't worry, my male fans are dying to see me. Why go clubbing so early? The early bird gets the VIP room. Don’t you know that? Call me, I'm going. See you. Geez. Hye Ji’s pretty, right? Who? Her? She's quite popular I guess. What kind of girls do you like? Me? Me… In photos, or in real-life… Girls who look the same. Girls like that are hard to come by. Let’s go. Did you bring your car? Maybe I should’ve brought it in case I didn't like you. What? Do you drink? Yes, but I'm not that good at holding my liquor. Let's go. Women hate being told that they're spoiled. But they love being spoiled by men. It's ironic, but it suits me perfectly. Should we go then? Perfect. Hello. Is this all? Yes. You shop lavishly like Paris Hilton but you're hopeless at research. Grab this stuff and follow me. Yes. Talk about poor taste. You're really something. - Meeting cancelled. - Excuse me? She can’t focus in Seoul She's going to write on Jeju Island. I didn't bring anything with me. Goodness. What makes you think you’re invited? Don't get ahead of yourself. Just do as you're told. Do I just have to summarize? No, something way more important. The twins will be wearing Power Ranger hats. Take them home and feed the dog. Make sure it's diet dog food. If you're not sure, eat it yourself. Why don’t you have a car? Because she's poor. Does not having a car make me poor? If you were rich, you'd own a car. When I grow up, I can buy you a car Will you marry me? Stupid! If you grow up, she’ll be a wrinkly old grandma by then! She can have injections in her face like mom, you fool! What? Fool? I’m older than you! You called me stupid first. Hey! When your mom comes home… It's not because I hit you. You have to tell her that you had a fight, okay? Hey! We fought after she left, right? I'm not that stupid. Don’t worry we won’t put you in a difficult situation. You can go now, don't worry. Okay, you’re angels I'm going then. Bye, bye! Oh my gosh! That’s my favorite movie too! - Really? - Yeah! That’s fantastic! Wonderful! I'm so glad I came to Korea. I'm sorry...sorry. I’m late to be… Because I’m late, late student. Bad student. Phew… Eat it. Enjoy it. Eat it, eat. Hey… Come over. Did you poison it? Crazy woman. How do you write a letter of resignation? Just quit and keep your phone turned off - Min Hee. You're supposed to write swear words -Hye Ji. Just hand in an empty envelope. No-one reads it anyway – Soo Jin. Aren’t you… Lee Yoo Min? Lee Yoo Min? - Yes? - What? Lee Yoo Min? It's heavy, take it. Wow! You won? It’s good to see you, Yeong… It's Yeong Mi, Kim Yeong Mi. I didn't know you'd be interested in this area. I'm not interested. I just got tied up because of someone I know. Thanks. No way. It's so hard to become a TV writer. Have you been doing this for a long time? Yes, but I’m still an assistant If this project goes well, I might become a sub-writer. The position's vacant right now. Good for you. Do you meet up with anyone from high-school? No, I don’t even see my university friends that often. We're meeting up today. Do you want to come with me? No. I hate loud places Yeah… Enjoy yourself. Hi! Okay… My friend. What’s up? Hey, Seok Won! Is she a friend? My wife. What? You are my wife. You're crazy. She's the one who's crazy. What will we do with her? It's Hye Ji. Let's go. Look at all these zombies. It’s a club, what do you expect? Yoo Min… You know I really like you, right? Are you drunk already? And tonight… I seriously… Don't want to send you home. And now… This is seriously awkward. Hey! Are you this close already? What? We’re already really deep Didn’t you know? Did you know? What? Let's go to the bathroom. We're going to go have a smoke. You can't go. Girls don’t just pee and throw up in the bathroom like guys do. Just let us go. Come on You should say no if you don't like it. What did I do? You had the most awkward smile ever on your face. You saw that in the dark? Come and sit down. How far have you gone with him? We haven't even kissed yet. I feel awkward being with a guy other than Soo Hwan. Hey! To think that my best friend slept with the same guy for 2 years. What a nightmare. If you like him, make him yours. Otherwise, just dump him. What’s with him? Quit smoking. What do you think of me? You're so annoying. He's not weird or anything. Just meet him a few more times. Okay. I don't think he'll harm me. Geez… Should we call the girls? I miss them so much. Fine then. Okay, I'll get changed and be right over. You'd better not get drunk yet. Okay, 30 minutes. (Seized goods.) Are you happy lately? You're shaking it like a 70 year old. You mean a 17 year old. How’s your English going? That’s right. You said a university student is giving you private lessons. It's over. Wasn’t he any good? It's not that. He kissed me all of a sudden. So why did you fire him? I told him if he ever did it again, we'd no longer be teacher and pupil. So? All of a sudden. He kissed me. Luck you. No way. I'm really hopeless. I think he did it, just to get out of teaching me. What? - No way. - Geez. (We regretfully inform that you were not cast.) Do you enjoy working full-time? What? Yes… What’s the difference between a casual and a full-time job? Casual jobs are like living together. Full-time jobs are like marriage. That sounds so frustrating. But I'm glad I gave up acting. Hey! That guy! See that one? What a hottie. I’m sleeping with him tonight. I bet 1 bottle of hangover drink that you will sleep with him. I bet a massage coupon that she can’t sleep with him. I bet she’ll be too drunk to know if she slept with him or not… Come on! It could be love! Okay then. Why not? Let’s have a drink and get out there. Okay. Come on, cheers! Cheers! Do it! Oh, I feel so sick… Yoo Min, you should feel sorry for yourself. Hello. Just look at me. Is this the script that I wrote? Why is the order different? I just did as the sub-writer said… Are you a spy? - Excuse me? - Are you an alcoholic? No… All the directors complained that you stink of alcohol. Why do I have to hear such complaints? I’m sorry. I want to see the completed screenplay on my desk in 2 hours. Yes. Coffee… Drink up, drink up. You should’ve learned how to work hard, not just look good. Take care. That’s annoying. What a cow! Yoo Min! Just wipe it up. Wouldn’t you be upset if you were me? It took me 2 whole days. You could finish this in 20 minutes. You’re so good. The main writers like me when I organize data for them. When don’t they like you then? When I put forward my ideas. When they look bored to death… I wish I could take back my words. My parents think I’m insane to give up on being a public officer to do this. But what I can I do? It’s my dream. I wanted to work at the major networks… Aren’t you on a major network? I was declined every time. I only just made it at my company too. We’re both assistants, what’s the difference? I don’t have that. This? Yoo Min… Yes? If you look at the successful writers… Keep going. Many of them are really pretty. So? Should I get myself fixed up? Should I have plastic surgery? If I’m pretty, do you think people will take my ideas seriously? I guess looks really do matter. Don’t be mean. She’s really nice. Anyway, I want to see what she looks like. Soo Jin must be here. Did Soo Jin rob a bank to buy herself a Bentley? Goodness! Hey… Who’s the guy in the Bentley? Geez… He’s just a guy that I know. Then introduce him to me. Or me. You girls are so hopeless. She’s being suspicious. Don’t bother looking at the titles. Just watch something that’s adults only. Should we buy Hye Ji’s ticket? Yes, she’s coming. She’s not answering the phone. I hope nothing’s wrong with her. No. It’s Hye Ji. Is she here? Are you seeing things now? There… Do you want to buy those jeans? They’re not very nice… You were dancing at a club when the director saw you? At first, I thought he was trying to make a pass at me. Was he with Kim Tae Hyeon? Kim Tae Hyeon? The Kim Tae Hyeon? Yes. The one and only Kim Tae Hyeon. Wow… Why is it that all celebrities debut in the same fashion? So you’ll be going to work at the same agency as Kim Tae Hyeon? How much are they paying you? $100,000? $100,000? They’re paying that much for a rookie? You said there’s nothing that you want to do. You said being in love with work was all lies and vanity. I know… It’s really strange. Do I seem arrogant? Am I frustrating? Yes. Yes. Okay. I will. I have to go. Kim Tae Hyeon’s here. Are you going to shoot with him? As his partner? I guess so. We work at the same agency. What if you get into a scandal with him? I doubt it. He doesn’t even know that I’m alive yet. I’ll call you, bye. Drive carefully. I always wondered what would happen to girls who just party like Hye Ji. If she had nothing to do later in life, I was going to help her out. Hye Ji could live the way she did. Because she knew she’d succeed. Hye Ji is so pretty. What do you think people have been telling her since she was little? If you think about it, I think Hye Ji tried her best to succeed. Every time I called, she’d be working out. She’d be getting messages through some guy she knows. She’d have cosmetic surgery. She tried her best, so she succeeded. Hye Ji’s so pretty and now she’s a celebrity. Min Hee’s parents are really rich. Me? Me… I’m smart and can take care of myself. Even though now… Lee Yoo Min! The one who should really be worried… Is you. You! What? What about Yoo Min? She has a job. Her family’s not poor. She’s pretty too. Average pay. Average skills. Average face. Everything’s average. Just in-between. Don’t say that. Yoo Min… She’s able to adjust to every situation. Her color changes to fit every situation. Like an iguana. You mean a chameleon. She has no roots. Just changes color slightly to fit in. A chameleon. Lee Yoo Min? What will you do? Why do you live that way? Yoo Min, she’s really drunk. She won’t remember a thing. Should we just beat her up? I’m going out to take a call. Hye Ji had now officially taken over Apgujeong. But none of us had bothered to congratulate her yet. Isn’t that Hye Ji? Probably. Is she a celebrity? Probably. What have you been doing? You both majored in Theater and Film. She’s a star now, what about you? Goodness. What are you going to do? Do you even think you can get married to a proper man? You still haven't achieved anything at your age. I don’t believe this. What on earth is wrong with you? What? What? Sorry, I’m not pretty like Hye Ji! Geez! Just answer the phone. (Seok Won) Go easy on the free booze. We finally get to see the boss. Hello. What do you think of my bar? It’s really nice. How did you two meet? Hye Ji’s school friend Hye Ji introduced us. Yoon Hye Ji? I heard they’re trying to make a scandal out of her and Kim Tae Hyeon. His stepmom owns a cable TV station so he’s well-informed. They’re really trying to make her into a star. That’s good news. Sure. If you went to school together, you must be jealous of Hye Ji. Not all students from our major become actresses. You ignorant fool. Not all athletes win gold. She’s a TV writer. Really? What productions have you done? I’m just a rookie. An assistant then. It must be frustrating sucking up to the head writers. You should just marry Seok Won. He’s worth way more than your salary. Or how about dating me? You fool. You’re not really my type anyway. I’ll tell my stepmom about you Give me a call sometime. You won’t regret it, so don’t throw it out. Enjoy yourselves. - It’s nice here. - Really? She’s not bad. Kind of cute. He likes to joke, but he’s a good guy. Let’s get out of here. Why? Are you getting drunk? Why is your face so red? Let’s go. Where? Seok Won! How are you? - Yes, it’s good to see you. - It’s been ages. Hi, Hye Rim. Sorry, but I have to go right now. Where are you going? I’ve got something to do, I’m off. I haven’t seen you in ages. I have to go. Hey, Seok Won! Goodness! Did you sleep well? Let’s sleep in a little longer. I have to go to work now. You said Saturday’s your day off Let’s sleep a little longer. Let’s order room service then leave. You slept with another guy besides Soo Hwan. That’s really weird. I feel weird too. I don’t feel anything really. Are you all right? Oh? Hye Ji says she’s coming here. Hye Ji? We’re almost done here. Why’s she coming? Tell her to come to the whirlpool. Let’s just eat some eggs. Oh? Who’s that? You’re alive. Hi. Are you a mummy? You know I’m scared of water Why here of all places? You scare me more. My manager told me to dress like this. Your manager is your latest man now? Are you sure you’re not covering up because you’ve committed so many sins? Hey. I heard you slept with Seok Won. What about Soo Hwan then? Out for good? I guess so. Good. You went out with him for too long. You should meet a lot of men It will improve your skills. It’s not good to be too skilled in bed. I saw your drama preview. Are you enjoying shooting? No. I wait hours and get to say 1 line. I have to take acting classes again with a bunch of high-school kids. It’s annoying. I know how that feels. My body’s loosened up but my shoulders are sore. Hey, smart friend. Massage my shoulders for me. What? Why should I massage your shoulders? Look… Do you think you can look down on everything because you have it all? Geez… You’re scaring me. Can’t you massage your friend whose tired. because she’s working hard? Do you even know what working hard means? I work to make a living just like you. Of course, I know. It’s different. You never made an effort. You just won a lottery. Don’t you think it’s tasteless and immature for you to whine like this? Tasteless? Choi Soo Jin! Have you ever been in my shoes? Don’t you dare say that to me. Grow up, both of you. Friends can complain to each other about minor things, can’t they? Only when we’re all in the same situation. Is that it? Choi Soo Jin! Is that what you wanted to say? The situation has changed so our friendship has to change now too? Is that it? Hye Ji… It’s not the apple that is poisoned It’s your heart. Do you know that? Really… Yes, Miss Choi. That’s enough. Thank you. I’m sure you know that even normal people can act as well as that. Okay then. Should I try something else? I learned jazz dancing for a while… Or Korean traditional singing or dance… I can act in English or Chinese… I lost everything because of you. Family, love… Even my friends. Now it’s your turn… Cut, cut, cut! What is this? Why are we even shooting? Director… Let go of me. I don’t have a single useful take. Why are you doing this to me? Did another film company send you here? Let go. Why are you doing this to me?. You could cause me to lose everything. My work, my friends… Hye Ji will get better soon. We could die before that happens. And what’s with this fake snow? Hello? Yes, hello. Everything’s just fine. Your sons are so smart and polite too. Yes, they’re so polite and cute… They don’t even need rules. They’re so good. Public Prosecutor’s Office. I have to pay for parking so make it quick. We’ve been waiting for this divorce. Let us handle it calmly. It’s my first divorce. Let me take a deep breath. If you see any prosecutors or judges that you like, take a picture. I’ll arrange for you to meet them. They both tried their best. My friend! Where are you? I got cut off. No, I can hear you. Talk to me. I… Haven’t had it in ages. I thought you were doing it all the time now. I… I haven’t gotten my period. Really? Shouldn’t you go see a doctor? The gynecologist? Where else? The vet? Oh no… How about using a pregnancy test kit? You’re not the one who’s late. You’re making me feel even more nervous. Fear of pregnancy… That can lead to depression and suicide. Don’t worry, I won’t kill myself even if I’m pregnant. You promise? Yes. If I do die, I’ll send you the engraving for my tombstone as a text message. Hey! Don’t say that! So refreshing! I let it all out. By the way, your character descriptions were really good. You don’t want to give up writing to raise babies yet, do you? I feel so fresh. Don’t worry, we were totally safe. So just smile and eat. I’m a little nervous and scared. What if something goes wrong? Open up. It’s good, right? See? You don’t even feel sick. You’re not pregnant. You’re just late, that’s all. It’s good. Have some more. Eat up and let’s order some take-out too. Yoo Min! Lee Yoo Min! These eggs are expensive. I didn’t get it. What? Promoted to sub-writer? Yes. Everyone voted for another girl who’s 1 year my junior. Maybe she has contacts. If only that were true. I think I’m just not talented. All her ideas were approved. She won an award in a screenwriting competition. I guess our company didn’t want to lose her. I should probably quit my job now. Getting your ideas approved or winning awards That all involves luck too. Just wait until it’s your time. No-one has been an assistant as long as I have. Want to know something? In disaster films, the main character always survives. But next to them, extras like me die without ever saying a line. They die whilst eating, driving, sleeping. Even while eating eggs. But what can you do? You have to live pretending to be the lead That’s the only thing that keeps you sane. Still… You can never be the lead. That’s true. Do you want to be a writer that badly? You have a dream, I don’t… Why are we both so depressed? Don’t you like the yellow part? It makes me feel sick. I don’t like the white part. It’s too bland. Eat it slowly. Thanks. Look at this! – Min Hee. Hye Ji! A house party? Yes. Her boobs got really big after she had some injections. She let someone take that picture to show off her big boobs? Someone undid her bra straps as a joke. Geez. Are we really going to Busan right now? Why won’t she pick up? Don’t you have her manager’s number? I think he just sent her to Busan so the journalists can’t find her. She’s scared of water Why send her to the beach? I know. I hope she doesn’t do anything stupid She won’t pick up. You guys are totally overreacting. She has a past record from high-school. She said she faked it so she could get plastic surgery done. Anyway, who didn’t try to kill themselves in high-school? I never tried. Neither did I. But I feel like trying it these days. What? - Let’s go. - Hey. - Go, go. - Min Hee… Let’s go. I don’t want anyone to fight. Just comfort her, okay? Where’s her room? Here. Press it. You press it. Why do I have to do everything? You press it. You do it. My fingers hurt from driving all the way here. I’ll drive back home. You press it I can’t do it. No, you press it. What are you guys doing? Press it again. Hye Ji! Yoon Hye Ji! Hye Ji! I hope nothing’s happened to her. Hey! Yoon Hye Ji! Hye Ji! Hye Ji! Hye Ji! Oh no… Hye Ji! It’s okay. Hye Ji! Open up! Hye Ji! What are we going to do? Hye Ji! What’s going on? Why are you all here? You look like you saw a ghost. Do they usually book you a nice room like this? They said the journalists are worse if they find you in a cheap room. How about some beer? It didn’t take long to get here, right? Are you really okay? This looks really cool. Did you see it on the web? Your photo’s all over the web How could we miss it? Who started it anyway? Someone at the party, I guess. Maybe I should just become. a Korean Gravia model. I heard you can make heaps of money with that. I booked a massage. Do you want to come? Or can you guys go to the fish market while I get my massage? Let’ have a proper drink later. Are you going to stay? We know she’s okay now. We can go then. Let’s go. You don’t want to? Should I go alone then? What’s wrong with you? Why did you want to come here? To see how perfectly fine she is? Why? Is it too much for you? You thought I might have killed myself. Are you disappointed I’m alive? Yes. It’s really hard for me to look at you. Soo Jin… Stop it. Why do you always fight? It’s hard for you to see that I’m safe? Wow! What a great friend! Don’t put on an act. It’s offensive. What? An act? No, this is what I call acting. What are you doing? Are you both crazy? Choi Soo Jin, you’ve taught me another lesson. Is this what being a friend is about? Yes. I’m being nice because we’re friends. Because I have to keep seeing you. What? When I thought of you guys being successful… It made me really nervous. I especially can’t stand seeing how easily everything goes your way. Do I look like a pushover to you? If that’s the case, you should’ve felt friendship, not jealousy. You’re the one who has an easy life. You’re the one who lies. Choi Soo Jin, Seoul University degree in psychology. That’s right. Now you’re getting your masters there too. The student that you tutor. Haven’t you see her picture on my website? She went to my high-school. She knows you’re lying She enjoys it. Don’t you get it? You fake a degree just to tutor a student? Is that a permanent full-time job? Why do you care? I don’t care, but the fact that you try out at all these auditions. Doesn’t that mean you want to be like me? You’re so shameless. Do you know that? I kept my mouth shut for you But you… I can’t stand seeing you either. -Hye Ji, wait a minute -Let go. I have no reason to be here. My life’s turning out great and that’s making your life hell. I hate you. Yoon Hye Ji, I hate you. You don’t lie… My parents finally got divorced. I felt like I should admit something too. You’re a good friend. Yoo Min, you’re so mean. You never comfort me. That’s because… Yoo Min… You value money more than I thought. What? It’s true. You think people who are rich use money to solve all their problems. That’s what most average people think. But you’re my friend. Even if my family was poor… We would still be friends. If it was so hard for you, why didn’t you say anything? I did, all the time. But you never listened. You said this a long time ago. That I pick the best of the best. Do you know what the best thing that I’ve chosen is? No, I don’t know. Soo Jin lying about school, Hye Ji’s celebrity debut. Your parents’ divorce. We don’t know anything about each other. Nothing. Let’s go. You go without me. Okay… Maybe that’s better. We really needed each other tonight. But we turned our backs on each other and walked far away. You took good care of them. Do I just sign here? I want to get rid of these. Do you buy goods too? Of course. Why did you sell your precious babies? I’m going overseas to study. I put my car up for sale too. What? Why? My parents are getting divorced It’s such a mess. I have zero pocket money now. I’m having a terrible time in the middle. You should go once things settle down. No, I don’t want to delay it any further. Once I sell everything, I can pay for the 1st semester. Selling my things is almost as much fun as buying them. My family’s gone bankrupt. You’re joking, right? No. When did that happen? It’s been a while. Why didn’t you tell us? Soo Jin’s poor, so let’s have fast food. Soo Jin’s broke, so let’s not go shopping. Soo Jin’s having it tough, so let’s give her a free massage coupon. I didn’t want you to pity me. I was really afraid. Why should you be? You… You have a lot to be proud of. Yes, I’ve worked hard. But no-one seems to care about that. If I carry a luxury handbag that I rented. Or if I fake my education. They at least let me through the 1st round of auditions. I thought you gave up on acting. I pretended that I had. Why is the meat so burnt? I’ve let it all out, but I don’t feel better. Want to know why? Because nothing is clear when you’re in your 20s. I have to go. I have to act. What? Where? You’ve been abandoned. That’s the only bit of truth that I can tell you. Don’t say that. You’ll lose your husband, everything. It’s inevitable. It suits your life perfectly. What if I rise? You can’t do anything, anything at all. You crazy woman! Do theater and film students usually conduct hospital role plays? Because we make it believable. Can’t you play a kind role next time? The lead role is a patient, so we always play the bad guys. If their partner was a good person, they wouldn’t even be here. Really? Do you think I’m a bad guy to the people around me too? Didn’t you know? You’re horrible. What? Do you think I’ll be okay soon? Sure you will. I know it. You bought so much I’m dying to see it all. Wear it all next time we meet. I’m the one who’s been given presents. Why are you so happy? Because I’m a generous guy. Besides, now is the time to give gifts. What? I need to go to the bathroom. Let me go before dessert’s served. Okay. Maybe I like you too. Wait for me at Café Canada. - Did they tell you to wait? - What? Dessert. Do we have to wait? Oh… Dessert. They’re not serving any? Let’s just go then. Should we? My friend’s here from Canada. It’d be good if you came to meet him too. No, I should go home. Here. This. And this. Finally, Chanel. I’ve received so much today. I should give you a gift too. What kind of gift? I started my period. When? Yesterday. See? I told you I’m totally safe. Yes, you are. I don’t like to see my love worried. Let’s have a baby once we get married. I’ll make sure to be safe until then. You should go. Your friend’s waiting. Come with me next time He’s a great guy. Yes, I want to meet him too That guy… Bye. Friend! What took you so long? Anyway, thanks for calling me. Are you in the middle of a shoot? No. I’ve been on stand-by for 4 hours. I want to kill myself right now. You should be grateful they didn’t fire you after what happened. I guess I never get worried, so troubles escape me. Have you talked to Soo Jin? No. Don’t call her if you don’t feel like it. Did you call to make me mad? No. I’m going to use a pregnancy test kit. What? Hey! Lee Yoo Min! I know how that feels. That 1 minute of waiting… Women can get pregnant 365 days a year. You must use protection from now on. Who told me that? It’s good to see that you’re still able to crack jokes. Call me if you see 2 lines, okay? Don’t stress yourself over it. I’m hanging up. I need to pee. Geez. Hello? Yoo Min, it’s me. Yeong Mi. Hi. I wanted to give you something. I’m not at home right now I’m busy and work late these days. I thought so. That’s why I sent it to your office. Yoo Min… We’re friends, right? We went to high-school together. I guess you could call us friends. Thanks. I’m really busy right now. Let’s talk next time. Wait! It won’t take long, Yoo Min. Talk then. Yoo Min, I really want to see your writing. I’ll always be rooting for you. I’m hanging up now. Mom… Who? I’m sorry. Yes, I’m Lee Yoo Min. What is it? She hung herself in the shower last night between 10 and 11 p.m. Yeong Mi… Yeong Mi… Yeong Mi… You were the last person on her dial list Were you close to her? You can go now. Goodness. She’s so late! Did you come to work to have lunch? Hello. Do you think you can show up late just because your ideas were approved? I’m sorry. Lee Yoo Min, eyes on me. What’s wrong? Did someone die? I said, did someone die? Yes, she died. What? Yeong Mi died. Died? The assistant from our agency… Is her name Yeong Mi? - Yes - Why? How did she die? Is it another case of 20s depression? Was she disabled? No. Don’t talk like that. You don’t know anything. Yeong Mi… Yeong Mi was bright! You’ll feel better if you drink something warm. Drink it. I don’t know if this is the right time… But this came for you. Don’t feel so sad. Don’t cry. Think about how you can help her family and do that. When my husband passed away. Someone told me that. I think that was good advice. By the way, you got promoted. You’re a sub-writer now. Life’s funny, isn’t it? But that’s just the way it goes. (Writing Techniques) I feel so sick. Congratulations. What? Congratulations on getting an award. Thanks. Writing’s fun, isn’t it? I want to become a writer when I’m older. But I’m not talented like you. Even I get bored when I read my work. It’s for you. Take it. I copied this book and it worked. Are you really giving it to me? Thanks so much. Wait… What about you then? I don’t need it anymore. Once I become a real writer, I’ll give it back to you. Thanks so much. You’ll need it again some day. I’ll return it to you. Bye. Bye. Should I help you put it on? Why do you look so sad? Mom… Mom… What is it? What’s so tough? Mom… There was so much that I wanted to say. But my voice would only come out when I cried. My friend Yoo Min! Don’t cry. Smile and shout out to the world. She tried to sound cool even at the very end. Isn’t this a bit much? We didn’t even know her. If she’s Yoo Min’s friend, she’s our friend too. Do I wear black? Like our graduation gowns? Take your earrings out Your lipstick’s too dark too. Really? There’s Yoo Min. Yoo Min. Lee Yoo Min! You came! Thanks so much. I look really lifeless, don’t I? That’s how you’re supposed to look at funerals. I see. Where’s Hye Ji? She’s busy at a shoot. She sent that over instead. (From actress, Yoon Hye Ji) Yoo Min, you should be our next alumni chairperson. How did you gather everyone? I just put it on my Twitter. Yeong Mi must’ve been really nice. Why? Even if you called everyone up, there are so many people here. I wonder how many people would come if I died? Hey. There’s someone who would come to your funeral. It’s Yoon Hye Ji. Hey guys. I’m here. Thank you. Aren’t you cold? No. It’s not that cold outside. Did you finish your shoot? No, the studio is near here. We have a 1 hour break, so I came. But I didn’t have time to get changed. So I had to wear whatever was on the set. What’s the theme of your shoot? A male flower that wants to become a woman. It hasn’t blossomed yet, so I’ve been like this for the last 3 hours. When is it going to bloom? Go stand next to the flowers you sent You make a great couple. What? That? Excuse me… Hello. - Yes - Are you busy? No, we’re not busy. I’m really close to Yoo Min too. I see. If you’re not busy, can I ask for an autograph? - Sure. - On my back. On your back? You have such a broad back. Wait a minute, geez… Are you writing a novel on his back? It’s just that I’m really detailed. Write as long as you want. What about anti-fans? Do you give autographs to them? Are you making up or fighting? I don’t think we need to clear the beer bottles today. You’re such a bad girl. You’re such a blabbermouth. Hey. Shall we have a drink then? Shall we? Cheers! It’s so good. You two have a drink, hurry up. This modest funeral of Yeong Mi’s… Will hopefully take away all the worries of our lives at 24 years. I really hope that will happen. I’ve been thinking… No, no… (Maybe we should stop here) All right then. Min Hee, wonderful! What? Wonderful? This is mine! It’s really mine! I scored 61! I got an extra point! Wow! Everyone, clap. Say congratulations! I’m going! I made it! Oops. Come with me. No, no, not me. I said come with me. Hey! Let go! Geez. This is a crime! I heard youth crime was serious. Where are you going? Where? Ouch! Damn… Where is it? You’re not coming to class anymore, right? What? Why? Are you going to follow me home? Just memorize these. Then you can communicate with Americans. Study hard. What’s wrong? You’re scaring me. I don’t know. It’s just my way of saying bye. Take care of yourself then. Seung-won! Yoo Seung-won! Do you know my name? Yoo Seung-won? I read it on your uniform. It’s written on your notebook too. Sorry I hit you. I’m sorry too. I didn’t want you to find out that I had a crush on you. Goodbye, I’m going now. Don’t call me back. She’s so pretty. He’s so cute! I’ll get a headache if I cry in the cold. Director, you have such a beautiful heart. Forget rehearsals, let’s shoot now. Of course. Tell her she has to do it herself. Hye Ji, can you do it yourself? Our director’s such a pain. He loses it when the camera starts rolling He’s driving me crazy. How can you jump off here yourself? You can’t do it, right? I’ll do it. What? Let’ shoot it right now. Thank you, Hye Ji. Let’s get it in 1 take! Let’s shoot. Let’s shoot it. Action. Cut. Okay! Okay! Okay! You did a great job. Nicely done. We didn’t even have a farewell party. I’ll be here during school vacations. Have you been admitted? You’re already talking about vacations? I’m confident. I made the TOEFL cutline. Make lots of Yankee friends. Don’t just hang around Koreans. Go browse at the shops every day, okay? I have to get away from your nagging. Hye Ji gets herself in trouble so I should see her on the web. Make sure you update Twitter often. Call me all the time I’ll pay for your calls. I’ll pay for your calls Just answer our calls. Don’t fall in love and dump your friends. I don’t think Hye Ji can make it. She’s busy shooting her drama. (Announcement) You should go. Go. Hurry inside. Don't shop at the duty free and miss your flight. Call as soon as you land, okay? It's expensive make-up, so I'm not going to cry. Don't cry. I should go. I'm going. Bye. Go. I’m really going now. See you. I feel so sad. I know. I feel really empty too. Hey! Min Hee! Kang Min Hee! Hey! Why are you so late? Where’s Min Hee? Has she gone already? You should’ve called. I was in a rush. I didn’t bring my phone. What’s that? It’s Min Hee’s birthday. I wanted her to blow out the candles. That’s right. It’s her birthday. Why didn’t she say anything? I feel terrible. Why didn’t you call? I totally forgot. We kept forgetting as usual. And so our friendship continued. We forgot about jealousy, grudges, hatred. (10 months later) What? Are you upset? You’re not going to throw yourself off a bridge, right? Get over it. I’ll introduce you to a guy. You can’t come to New York then? You said you’d buy a ticket with the prize money. You said you’d buy 50 play tickets. And buy my fans a meal too. I’m starting to feel glad that I didn’t win. Lee Yoo Min! Are you okay? Min Hee didn’t get admitted to Parsons for you. Hye Ji’s part was given to a teenage actor. You didn’t get cast in your audition too. See what great friends you have? Don’t let the judges get to you. We’ll keep failing as long as you do. You’re not helping. Let’s hang up. I miss you so much. - Me too. - Same here. This is nuts… Me too. Let’s hang up before someone cries. Take care of yourselves. I’ll visit soon, okay? Wait! We’re another year older! Just hang up. Resignation, independence… And today, my 10th drama contest entry failed. I probably have many more failures lined up. But 25 is a great age at which to dream and to challenge ourselves. And right now… I’m at the center of my life. (Welcoming for 34th Theater and Film New Students) Sit down! Sit down right now! Sit where your name is written. Your name! Can’t you read Korean? Aren’t you old enough to read? (Lee Yoo Min) Do you want me to shout again? Look at the ceiling, the ceiling… Raise your bottoms! I’ll spank you! Are you a cow? A pig? A horse? Why do you want to get hit? Be quiet! You’re late! Come sit down right now. Don’t turn around! That’s right, you! Come in and sit in your seat. I can harass you for the next 4 years. Must I curse at you? Be quiet all of you! Sit down right now. Everyone be quiet. Stop talking. Hey, you 4! What’s so funny? Why are you laughing? Don’t laugh at me! You 4 little black beans! Don’t laugh!
