THREE MONTHS EARLIER So... do you believe in fate? When I met you, I finally... WHEN I MET YOU, I FINALLY... Understood why I was born. Really? What do you mean by that? I will protect you... always. The type of guy all women love, The knight in shining armor type. When a girl is lonely, in a crisis, or crying alone, he always shows up. He's the ideal... Excuse me. Here's your bill. That will be 2,980 yen. Oh, no! I forgot my wallet today. Sorry, but can you loan me the money for this? Do I have to pay again? The bill. Wait, the bill! Next time I'll pay... How pathetic. What? You're leaving already? I have to get back to work. Let's meet again. I'm so lonely. The spoiled, young, cute type of guy. He's as helpless as a pet, but he soothes tired older women, invigorating them to work hard... Hey! Takun, what are you doing? Who is she? A friend of my mom? What? Let's go! Or there's the most popular, the harsh, proud type. Don't look at other guys. Only look at me. He's always condescending and talks sharply with women, but he's actually gentle-hearted. - Is everything ready? - Yes. Go ahead. What? This isn't ready at all! How many years have you been an assistant? I'm sorry! How pathetic. Now that I'm 27, it's quite clear to me. In the real world, the chances of never meeting my ideal prince... like in the movies and comics... are 99.999999 percent. My... goddess. Was that a dream? No, it wasn't! GAME APPLICATION KICK-OFF DATING SIMULATION GAME MEETING I'm Momose from the content division. We'll be launching a new game into the smartphone dating simulation game market. Currently, the market brings in 13.7 billion yen annually. I've asked the game designer Riko Shirano to develop the game. I'm Riko Shirano. It's nice to meet you. The characters are crucial in building a good dating simulation game. The key to a hit is whether or not the male characters are men that the women who play can fall in love with. The main character should be either a prince type... or a proud type. Those are the most popular. As for the hair. Long is good. This is good too. That's what I want! Discussing this kind of thing is fun. Here are some characters in a game that I designed recently. Here's how the illustrations turned out. Have a look. - Amazing! - Wow! Here's a game screen. You want me to kiss you, don't you? So proud! Ms. Shirano, how do you think of such romantic lines? I could never come up with these all on my own, so I walk around town to get ideas. Often, it's not much help, though. Hello. - Hello! - Hello. He waved! He just waved at me, didn't he? Ms. Shirano? Oh, sorry. It's nothing. A meeting made in heaven. And now we met again. This must be... What is this? "15 Tokugawa Love Shogunates." What is this? Are you stupid? Did you even research this? History is popular now, so this? Yes. Many women have said they find it catchy. "All 15 Tokugawa shoguns are here." How is that even possible? And you didn't even list the names of all the shoguns. What about Yoshimune and Tsunayoshi? Do you think this is interesting? Women like to fantasize. Fantasize. I see. You know, something funny happened yesterday. I'll get a taxi. I was at a wedding reception. My glasses. Don't step on them. My glasses... That woman stared so enchanted into Midoritani's eyes. She must have thought it was fate. He just wanted his glasses. - Mr. Kurokawa. - Isn't that what fantasy is? Isn't that what makes a stalker? "Stalker"? I'll admit, I agreed to a game because a hit can rake in money. But our site's users are women living in the real world. They're interested in fashion and cosmetics. Make something targeted at them. Don't damage our classy image. "Classy"? You see... the only women who would enjoy this are either ugly or stupid. Damn. I can't believe this kind of thing is popular. It just shows how many women are out of touch with reality. They're very aware of reality. "I am thinking of you 24 hours a day, 365 days a year." Get a job! There isn't a man in the world like this. We're making him up because there isn't any! Stalker! I have a question for you now. What's so attractive about real men? They're not just timid, they're not even interesting. They can't even seduce women without searching on the Internet. "Should I pay on our first date?" Those are the kinds of questions they ask. They can't even say, "I love you," but they break up by text. And once you start dating, they either cheat or beat you. You're all idiots who have no idea how to please or treat women properly. All the men in the real world are pathetic, so we have to create our own! There's one kind of man that I cannot stand. The kind that scoffs at falling in love. Whether it's in fantasies or video games, women are soothed when they fall in love. They're motivated to do their best at their job, housework, or studies. If you can't understand that, then you're blind to reality! That's what I think, at least. Actually, Ms. Shirano... Who is that guy? He's our company president. Your president? That game designer is no good. Replace that whole team and start over. Who came up with this stupid plan? It was me. Ms. Momose worked hard on that. Why did you call them stupid and ugly? Here's the marketing data for this dating simulation game. This is pretty good. I heard that you'll be entering the dating simulation game market. As a company that's supported women of all different lifestyles, we hope the thrill that this game gives women will motivate them to do their best at their job, housework, or studies. What the heck? He's copying exactly what I said. Ms. Shirano? Please. This way. He's pretty young, right? He's younger than me, right? Thanks for those reservations the other day. - No problem. - Did you cut your hair? He's a total prince type! Such good communication skills! Mr. Midoritani. The board meeting is at 3:00 p.m. Got it, 3:00 p.m. What? He's in a high position? Hey, Mr. Midoritani. He's so perfect! Sorry for the trouble. What? Our president said a lot of rude things the other day. That's okay. But I'm surprised to see such a quick change after what he said. He's quick to take on new ideas, isn't he? I guess so. What you did was incredible. I'd never seen Mr. Kurokawa speechless like that. Our president has been a cutting-edge programmer ever since he was in the university. The task manager he made as a student was a big hit. I use this. He started this company as a student. Even now, the president himself is still developing smartphone business apps. Is that right? He's a talented manager. I joined this company because I admired him, and entered a business competition for students. That's what we created together at that time. The cosmetics rating site? Yes. It became a hit and led to our mainstay business aimed at women. However, he has one crucial fault. A fault? He doesn't understand a woman's heart. A woman's heart. Ms. Shirano. Let's begin, shall we? Okay. - I'll bring this. - Thank you. This one is nice. What do you think? - It's nice. - He's so handsome. Is it going well? We're discussing character designs with the illustrator. I see. I received these. That's Dalloyau. Thank you! Let's have these! Sorry, but I have to make a call. - Don't you want a cream puff? - I don't like whipped cream. Wow! Look at these! - Have some. - Thank you! Shall we take a break and eat lunch? Okay. - Anyone want to go for lunch? - What? - You'll treat us today, President? - If you've been working hard. - All right! - Yes! What luck! - Okay. - Thank you. What about you, Momose? I brought my lunch. Go ahead. Oh, okay. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Hello. Momose speaking. Yes. I brought Mont Blanc... Yes. It looks like... That has whipped cream in it too. Really? I can see you like Ms. Momose. What? Those were three perfect strikes. Cream puffs. Lunch. Mont Blanc. Are you kidding? She's ten years my junior. You're so easy to read. I'm simply... At any rate, this is none of your business. Yes, you're right. Goodbye. Handsome Office Worker: Cinderella Overtime, Chapter Two. What? Handsome... HANDSOME OFFICE WORKER: CINDERELLA OVERTIME You're hired. However, on one condition. Don't you ever fall in love with me. This is so corny. I HATE THE PRESIDENT! I NEVER WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN! WHILE WORKING OVERTIME, I HEARD A WHINING NOISE COMING AT ME. What? A SNACK FOR YOU Oh, no. President Kurokawa! What are you doing? Well... You see... I'm sorry. What? I didn't mean to insult women. If I've offended you, I apologize. Did you do this to tell me that? What's gotten into you, sir? Thank you for the snack. What are you doing at my place? I have a favor to ask you. A favor? I'd like you to... teach me about romance. What? Welcome. - Coffee. - Okay. Wow! This is a fantastic cafe! When I want to work at night, I usually come here. I know I won't meet any colleagues here. What would you like? I'll take this white marshmallow mocha with hazelnut syrup and caramel sauce on top. That will make you fat. Here you go. Wow! That's so cute! Thanks for this. This is delicious! It was a success. Excuse me? Your idea the other day. Excuse me? Handsome Office Worker: Cinderella Overtime, Chapter Two. The radio-controlled car? You really did that? That was your suggestion, right? Fantasy and reality are totally different. But I am glad to hear that it worked out. So, what's this about me teaching you about romance? You're a pro at that stuff, right? Why does he think that? I haven't had a boyfriend for years. Since then, I have tried all of the top ten dating simulation games, but I didn't understand any of them. I have absolutely no idea what makes them so popular. So, I have a job for you. I want you to teach me about dating simulations. Oh, that's what this is. When a company first enters the gaming industry, it cannot fail. So, the president cannot approve a plan without understanding it. To understand it, I must communicate closely with the project leader. That's why... What? Is this for the company? Or is this your way for Ms. Momose to like you? It's for the company! Mr. Kurokawa. The situation is desperate. What? I hate to say this, but women don't really like you, am I right? How rude! I think I'm pretty well-liked. Whenever you date a woman, she always dumps you, right? I'll tell you why. In the past 30 minutes, you've committed numerous errors. Errors? You lay in wait. You suddenly showed up, believing I'd do what you want. The cafe door. You entered without caring about the person you were with. It was the same when you ordered coffee. Even if you found a seat first, you should worry if I knew where you were. Then, there's the way you talk. You don't even care if I'm listening. You prattle on alone without looking me in the eye. A conversation is like playing catch. You're just throwing the ball and letting it hit me. If you were my boyfriend, I'd get exhausted being with you. I mean, I'm not your mother, after all. You still think dating simulation games are corny, don't you? But, dating simulation games are full of things that women desire. Until you understand a woman's heart, you'll never understand dating simulation games. And the romance you are hoping to have with Ms. Momose won't go well. He's discouraged. So... why did you fall in love with Ms. Momose? It was three years ago. "In-company coup d’état?" Damn! Amazing! What? This is a defective product! I'm going to complain. What company made this? That was... I'm sorry. ...a new employee, Ms. Momose. You can have this, if you like. I'm full after eating snacks. It's delicious. I'm glad you like it. The egg I ate then tasted just like what my mom made. Mama's boy? He's a mama's boy too? My mom died when I was in third grade. It reminded me of the egg she made for my last sports festival lunch. Oh, I feel sorry for him now. Since then, I just can't forget her. I just can't help looking at her. And now, I'm... I see. One-sided love for a staff member for three years. It disgusts me! She's... just special. All the things I can do with other women, I can't do it with her. Just like asking for her number or inviting her out. We work at the same company, but I've only spoken to her for less than 30 minutes in total. I tried to convince myself to just give up, if telling her how I felt would screw things up. But when I think of speaking at her wedding... it's pure hell. Excuse me, but you're overthinking this. The other day... I said some terrible things. I'm sorry. I... scoffed at you. What? People who fall in love. You want to know, right? You want to know what makes a woman's heart skip a beat, right? Soichiro Kurokawa. Age 35. President. His looks... aren't bad. Character? Complex. Weaknesses. A woman's heart. She's... just special. Unexpectedly pure? Haruka Momose. Character? Serious. Talented. She likes fantasizing. If this were a dating simulation, how would I make them fall in love? It's no good. I need more information. It's time to try a character round-robin. A character round-robin? We'll see how she reacts to all the classic types. "Classic types"? Prince, proud, spoiled, composed, and carefree-but-faithful. All the men in these games have pretty much the same personality. - They're just stereotypes... - You're scoffing at women. No, I'm not. They're classics, not stereotypes. Since ancient times, women have loved these classic types. Master the classics, and you'll surely make a woman's heart skip a beat. Okay. We'll start with the prince. PRINCE TYPE I'll always be by your side. You want me to do this? It's okay. I'll take care of this. What? The prince character is doing well. Thank you for doing this. You've been working hard. Nice job. Nice. A little forced, though. But nice. Good! Next, the proud type. Who do you think you are, looking at other guys? His specialty is pinning a girl to the wall. Pay attention only to me. Not bad, coming from you. Well... Thank you. Next, is the younger spoiled type. Oh, if you don't pay me more attention, I won't like you. You know, I'm getting hungry. What? Do you want to go to the store? But, I've gotten sleepy too. What? Can I ask you something, Ms. Shirano? What? Is something wrong? The President has been acting... Did it catch your attention? He's becoming unstable. He must be tired from working so hard. I guess so. Now she thinks I'm unstable! It's okay. I have a secret plan. Secret plan? In dating simulations, what's as important as the characters is the situation. The situation? Love that starts from a forced kiss. Saving the girl from an attack. Both of them falling in a river. Getting caught in an elevator. The same stuff happens in all the games. They're stereotypes. They're not stereotypes! They're styles. Styles? Take Kabuki, for example. Years have been spent perfecting a style until it's beautiful. Do you see anyone stupid enough to criticize that? Instead of scoffing, people applaud, because it's what they've wanted. Some movies and dramas are watched dozens of times... I can't understand what you want to say at all! Let's go right now. - Here you are. - Where? - What? You're going? - Sorry. - Where are we going? - Where are you going? BETWEEN TOKYO AND LOVE EPISODE 1 BETWEEN TOKYO AND LOVE To learn the styles of romantic situations, trendy dramas are the perfect study material. - Come on. - Watch out! Why did you do that? I'm sorry. This is the perfect situation... to bring the hearts of two strangers closer together. BETWEEN TOKYO AND LOVE EPISODE 3 That guy... I'll forget all about that guy! Forget him. Carrying her on my back, I... When a man carries a drunk woman, they always become a couple. BETWEEN TOKYO AND LOVE EPISODE 7 Is this you? Yes. BETWEEN TOKYO AND LOVE FINAL EPISODE Hey! - Watch! This is the good part! - Mika! Don't leave me! Mika! Kenji! Marry me. Wow. It's morning. I haven't stayed up all night like this since I was in university. Me either. Do you want to get breakfast? I want to go home to shower and remove my makeup. This is the first time I've had one. Had what? A woman friend that I could talk to about anything. A friend? Me? Is this just business? I guess we are friends. I think you're the first one for me too. Bye. - Bye. See you. - See you. So, we're friends. YUSUKE: REMEMBER ME FROM HIGH SCHOOL? What's wrong? Did you catch a cold? Episode one of Between Tokyo and Love. The scene where they fell in the fountain? I couldn't force the situation and ended up falling in alone. Is this... President? Why did you do that? Do you want a grated apple? Here you go. Excuse me. Do you have any apples? Apples? Oh, we have apple juice. You take sweet sake for a cold, right? Not grated apple? We don't have either one. Here, it's sweet sake. I found it at the store. The owner warmed it up. That's a big help. I'm always alone when I catch a cold. When it's bad, I can't even go to the store. Me either. When I'm too weak to buy medicine or apples, I just have to sleep it off and get better. That's usually the way it is. Eating dinner and watching movies alone have become normal. All I do is work. We can't complain. We do it because we like it, right? By the way, you have been a programmer since you were a student, right? How did you start? After my mom died, Dad raised me on his own. Dad ran a small delivery company. Every day, he stared at his notebook setting up the drivers' shifts. I was in high school then and had just started programming. And... when I tried it, I realized I was pretty good at it. So, I spent all summer vacation making a delivery and shift system. By inputting the delivery and time of the job, the computer would automatically decide who would do it. My dad was really surprised. I bet he was happy. Thanks to that, what do you think I made? What? Let me see... Two hours for my dad each day. Time for him to have a beer, watch baseball, and talk with me. - That's pretty great. - Yes. I realized then that I could create anything I like with a computer. Since the time we have is limited, I want to make something that enriches our lives. And that brought me here. I see. So, what about now? What? Is your life enriched now, Mr. Kurokawa? Mine? I'm... pressed for time now. - It's the same with you, right? - What? Even though you're busy, you're making women happy with your computer. I guess so. I hope it's true. A guy? YUSUKE: I WANT TO SEE YOU. No. Just an invitation to a reunion. You know what? I went to all-girl schools until junior high, so I didn't know any guys. But, I loved comics for girls and romantic movies, so I wanted to fall in love like that too. Today, the flowers are gazing at the sun again. To me, the sun is you. Every day, I want to see your face at my side. Can I say something? I hate to interrupt, but why are you always adding English? I was young back then. Didn't you have a time like that? I texted him like that every day. I believed that he felt the same way about me, without a doubt. Ten years from now, or even a hundred years from now, I believe our feelings won't change. It's destiny. Cyrano de Riko. - Cut that out! - Okay, I will. Then at the school festival... MUSIC ROOM I want to see your face at my side To me, the sun is you Even a hundred years from now Our feelings won't change It's destiny Cyrano de Riko love poet Cyrano de Riko love poet Those guys really liked them. Cyrano de Riko love poet Cyrano de Riko love poet They made you laugh? That's good. That's probably when I realized you couldn't expect much from actual guys. I really was stupid. At the wedding in Motomachi, it was just like you said. I thought it was destiny, and I'd met my prince. I got all excited. Even though I knew that never happens in reality. So, that kind of feeling... The feelings of love... I decided... to express it in my work, through my games. That way, I wouldn't have to freak anyone out and it'll make women happy. That's what's best for me. You always analyze stuff immediately. What? Is that because you don't want to be hurt? You're going to the reunion, right? Put that past behind you. JIYUGAOKA GENERAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASS REUNION Riko! Oh, Yuka! You haven't changed a bit. Yes, I have. I have three kids. - That was fast! - It sure was. Riko! - Tomo! Long time no see! - Long time no see! - You haven't changed. - Shirano? Oh, Shirano! You've become really pretty. No, I haven't. You've matured, Yusuke. - How have you been? - Hey, everyone! Cyrano de Riko is here! One, two! Cyrano de Riko love poet Cyrano de Riko love poet Guys really are jerks. Forget them. Let's drink in there. Cyrano de Riko love poet Put that past behind you. Cyrano de Riko love poet Cyrano de Riko love poet Cyrano de Riko love poet What's wrong with you? Hey, it's been a while Cyrano de Riko is back Every day I'm working I've matured a lot in ten years But you're still chumps After ten years You haven't matured Or lost your virginity My romantic dreams were all fantasy I'll admit, they were corny love poems But you're the corny ones For laughing at them Pathetic boys! Sorry. You don't have a boyfriend, do you? Tell her, Yusuke. Riko. You really are the greatest. What? Let's go. Hold on! Keep your hands off my woman. That was a classic move, right? Why did you come? I wanted to take a break with you after work. Let's drink. This is my second secret spot. Don't tell anyone. Cheers. Actually, I had a poem incident too. What? In junior high, I wrote a love letter to a girl I had a crush on. The comic I was reading then had a huge influence on me. "Even when a salmon is about to be caught on a hook, or captured by a bear..." Hold on! What? Salmon? You mean like in a salmon lunch box? The one in those carved wooden bears' mouths? Yes, that salmon! "To spawn, salmon will swim upstream until they're exhausted. Being willing to die for a person is the same as falling in love. I love you." Then, the next day, my nickname became Salmon Kurokawa. I was young then. Don't laugh at love! But, that was crazy! Salmon? It's even more amazing that there's "river" in your name! Thanks for today. I'm really glad... that you came. Don't you worry. I'm certain... there's a man out there who will accept your love. Let's see... at a time like this... Right? What's going on? - Thank you. - Excuse me. - Can you look at this demo? - Okay. Thank you. Oh, it works! SPLASH! Oh, I'm sorry! WE'RE SOAKED FROM FALLING IN THE RIVER. WHAT DO I DO? "Get angry and say, 'What are you doing?'" "Laugh spontaneously." This one, for sure. LAUGH SPONTANEOUSLY I told you, I'm sorry. - Very nice. - You did it. Love sprouts because both of you fell in a river. Classic. Oh, dear! This feeling I'm getting... The release date on the Freicure Cosmetics ad was wrong? The client called us in a rage, and released the product immediately. Their president was upset because their promo was useless. He said they're canceling their contract with us. Why did that happen? I didn't check it properly because I was focused on the dating simulation. What a basic mistake! What are you doing? I'm terribly sorry! Should I tell the board? Not yet. Let's go. I understand why you're angry. It's entirely my fault! I apologize. I apologize. President, I really am very sorry. I have a rule. When I mess up, I apologize with all my heart, then eat udon. It's good for digestion, right? Then, I move on. We all know how hard you work. Just a little longer before the Christmas Eve release. Keep up the good work. - Thank you. - Thank you. Are you okay? What? You seem depressed today, Ms. Shirano. Oh, not at all. I'll finish up the game scenario. Excuse me, Ms. Shirano. Sorry for bothering you. No, it's okay. I was going to take a break somewhere anyway. Here's your order. Blend coffee. Marshmallow white mocha. Sorry. The girly one is mine. You have a sweet tooth, don't you? So... you and the president are getting along well lately. What? When the president talks to you, I noticed that he looked very relaxed. He asked me about dating simulation, so I've been teaching him. So... are you dating? Or does he like you? What? Of course not! Thank goodness. What? For some reason, I can't stop thinking about him lately. Before, I thought he was frightening and cold. But lately, he often talks to me. When I took a closer look... I found out that he is honest and very kind, though a little awkward. I'm here. - Hi. - Let's go. I'm going to postpone telling Momose that I love her. What? You see, she just messed up at work, and she's really depressed, so if I do this now, it will seem like I'm taking advantage of her feelings. You really are pathetic. What are you afraid of? We're going to look for a nice present for Ms. Momose, right? But... Wow! This is so pretty. I think she'd like this too. Wouldn't this be better for her? It's one of the most popular Star Jewelry pieces. Yes. I think this will look good on Ms. Momose. Yes. - Okay, I'll take this, please. - Okay. - It's a Christmas present. - Certainly. - This way, please. - Okay. That's a classic move too, isn't it? It's what women desire. You want me to buy you something too? What? You've helped me out a lot. If I want something, I'll buy it myself. What's with you? I'm offering to get you something. It's ready, sir. Okay. President! Sorry I kept you waiting. I would appreciate it if you don't call me "President" today. Then, how about Mr. Kurokawa? Okay. Let's go. Are you ready? I'm counting on your help when I'm in a pinch! Give me something to say! Damn him. How pathetic. Like this, on an ordinary holiday... Like this, on an ordinary holiday... I wanted to spend it... I wanted to spend it... with you. With you. So... Yes? So... Yes? Hold on. Go ahead. Emergency! My mind is blank! I need something to say! Do it on your own. The way you are now, you'll be fine. You can do it! So, Momose... Yes? I'm sure you don't remember, but three years ago, you gave me some eggs. I have never forgotten the way you smiled then. You're always smiling at the office. And every time I see you smile, it gives me the energy to work. I love your smile, Momose. I love you, Momose. YOU CAN DO IT! UNREAD Every year, it's getting harder to work all night. It's so cold! Is it really 39.1 degrees? What if I die? Will anyone notice if I do? Ms. Shirano! Delivery for you! Who's that? Okay! What? Hi! Why are you here? I'm coming in. - What are you doing here? - I'm visiting. Wow! What a total mess. How did you get in? What about the security door? I followed another resident who was coming in. Who said you could come here? I was worried. You have nobody to take care of you. - Keep out of my business. - I'll use your kitchen. What? When you catch a cold you eat a grated apple, right? What are you doing? What? You have a girlfriend, so you shouldn't be looking after a sick girl at her place. What's wrong? I have a girlfriend, but you're still my friend. Maybe you're okay with it, but Ms. Momose isn't. What? Why would she care? It was the same with Christmas. You were going to buy me something too. Are you stupid? What's gotten into you? I know! You said you didn't want anything, but you really did. No, that's not it. Why can't you understand? These are the kind of things you should only do for the woman you love! What's the matter? Please leave. I'm through with you. What made you so angry all of a sudden? I'm not angry. What? I know what it is! You're jealous because I'm in a relationship now. You're wrong. Well, then, I'll just have to introduce you to a nice guy. What are you talking about? What about Midoritani? He's your type, right? Come on, tell me. You, me, and Momose will plan how to capture his heart, okay? So, hurry up and get better... Why can't you understand? It's painful to watch you two... Because I'm in love with you! What? Leave. Leave! What are you reading? Cyrano de Bergerac. Have you heard about it? Oh, that's the story about a guy who had a problem with his big nose. Someone asks him to write love letters for him, right? Cyrano hid his love... and wrote beautiful love letters to help his best friend... succeed in love. How unrewarding. Cyrano... says that his destiny was to write words for others. He was fine with that. In a way... I think that was happiness for him. I mean, he was able to maintain his pure love without reality getting in the way. I don't think that's true. If you hide your true feelings, you'll never be happy. I am... in love with you, Ms. Shirano. I will become greater than Mr. Kurokawa. So... I want you to always be by my side, supporting me. As you can see from this chart, progress is coming along nicely on the new smartphone app game. That is all for this business report. What's wrong? I would like to propose a motion to dismiss the president. What's this all about? We hate to say this, Kurokawa, but as we take the company public, we believe making Midoritani the CEO will lead to better returns for shareholders. We'll focus on online sales... Online sales? Our company creates things. To grow the company even more, we need to make our main business one that will increase earnings. Midoritani... I can't believe you. I would like to take a vote now. Please stand if you agree. MARKETING MEETING NEW COSMETICS APP MEETING SERVICE PLANNING MEETING SELFISH PRESIDENT DUMPED BY EMPLOYEES This is all lies. MR. MIDORITANI, CEO HARUKA MOMOSE Hello? Ms. Shirano, do you know where Mr. Kurokawa is? No. Hasn't he called you since then? No. The company he built was more important than anything else to him. I'm worried something terrible might have happened. Okay. I'll look for him where I think he might be. No, he hasn't been here this week. Did you fight? What? Before, he used to always come here alone. But you've always been with him lately. Hey, kid. You're at a fishing pond, but you're not fishing? I can't touch raw fish. What? What a hopeless guy! I'm pathetic. SOICHIRO KUROKAWA SOICHIRO KUROKAWA MISSED CALL FROM SOICHIRO KUROKAWA Sorry I made you worry. I had free time, so I wanted to wander around. This happens a lot in this industry. I think I'll quit the company too. Let's just think we were blessed to have a vacation. We can relax together for a while. That sounds like a good idea. RIKO: HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR CHARACTER? What? Have you forgotten your character? Always arrives at work at 8:00 a.m., no matter what. Eats plain food when alone, and treats employees to fancy food for their hard work. A programmer to the core. Loves making things. Got his start by programming a system for his father's shipping company. Wants to do work that enriches people's lives. Has no understanding of a woman's heart. But all the effort he puts into learning and understanding is touching. His most hated word and food is salmon. His motto is, "I can do anything with a computer." The dating simulation game was released today without a hitch. It's become a hot topic. Thank you. Not at all. Thank you too. Ms. Shirano... can I have your answer to my question the other day? I'm sorry. I'm in love with someone else. Though I know nothing will come of it, I still love him. This is really frustrating. But, I'm glad... that I could hear what your true feelings are. The social networking app you released today is a hot topic. Thank you. - It's interesting, isn't it? - Yes. Is this the first step to building a new company? No. I did it on the spur of the moment, so I haven't thought any farther than that. I believe that you only need a computer to make something. Mr. Kurokawa, you seem to have... mellowed quite a bit. - Me? - Yes. Well... There was someone who always gave me a really good scolding. I think that person smoothed my edges. Thank you. Welcome. You're alive. - Hello. - Hello. Coffee and white marshmallow mocha with hazelnut syrup and caramel sauce on top. Okay. I'll bring it when it's ready. What do you want to do next? Do you want to watch a movie? Or maybe see the Christmas lights? What about dinner? What would you like? Momose? Here you go. Mr. Kurokawa do you know... who's sitting here with you? What? I don't like sweet coffee. Also... I'm not interested in you now that you're no longer the president. What? Goodbye. It only makes sense she dumped you. I was probably wrong to make that for her too. How's that girl who likes the marshmallow mocha? There's one kind of man that I cannot stand. The kind that scoffs at falling in love. You want to know, right? You want to know what makes a woman's heart skip a beat, right? Master the classics, and you'll surely make a woman's heart skip a beat. When a man carries a drunk woman, they always become a couple. Here, it's sweet sake. I found it at the store. It's the same with you, right? You're making women happy with your computer. I hope it's true. It's painful to watch you two! Because I'm in love with you! Salmon Kurokawa. Don't laugh at love! 15 TOKUGAWA LOVE SHOGUNATES I WILL BE THE SHOGUN, SO KEEP YOUR EYES ONLY ON ME. Teach me about a woman's heart. Why? Because, I want to love you. How dare that fantasy girl rearrange my words? What? HARUKA MOMOSE We broke up. Like I thought, real-life men are impossible. Today, I'll order pizza, and play your game all day at home. So, Ms. Shirano, why don't you spend a wonderful Christmas... ...with the one you love? Thank you. DOWNLOADING OPEN APP A new social networking site? "Lonely Christmas. A limited-time Christmas-only social networking site that will disappear in two days." REGISTER START CREATING ACCOUNT I had the Christmas lunch meal at the nearby Italian restaurant alone! I was lonely, so I texted my ex. Naturally, she ignored me. I'll buy a cake at the convenience store and watch Akashiya Santa. This stuff is really touching. YOU HAVE A FRIEND REQUEST Who's this? "Salmon Kuroka..." Salmon Kurokawa! Tonight I'm having a lonely Christmas. To us, pathetic people on this holy night, Merry Christmas. PATHETIC! PATHETIC! Like I thought, you're alone on Christmas Eve. You pathetic woman. You too. You were crying about being dumped on Christmas. Yes, I was dumped. It was your fault. You destroyed my love. For three years, I've only thought of her because of the egg she gave me. I loved her that whole time, and we were finally dating. Then you go and destroy it! What's going on? Even when I was with Momose, I'd suddenly think of you. To be honest, you're not even my type! When we met, it wasn't destiny or anything. In fact, it was awful. But still... whenever I felt hopelessly depressed, the person I wanted to call... and the voice I wanted to hear was yours! I can't live without you by my side! I want to date a prince type. But... why is it you? You're cruel and you ignore others. You're also selfish. Even now, you still don't understand a woman's heart. No! I do understand. What? Don't underestimate my ability to learn. What? This is a classic move, right? With you by my side... I can always be happy. Damn it. I never expected anything from real-life love. But now... I don't care how badly I'm hurt... because I want to love you. I always want to be by your side and make fun of your pathetic ways. You being with me... every day... will be rich and fulfilling. It won't fit! Don't force it! Try harder. Try harder? It hurts! We got it this far. Keep trying! It hurts! Are you stupid? Damn you! You really are pathetic! What? After I got you... It's insane to propose at a time like this! There's so much to do before that! Like what? THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL
