Okay, which one is he? I don't know if he's gonna be here or not. - Are you kidding me? - I think I should go. Um, I should probably go. Aw, but we didn't even make it to the bed, freshie. Oh, are you quarterback? Hey um, have you seen my brother? Nah. We didn't have to go, I was just seeing what was up. I just can't watch what you're up to with that guy. There was nothing to watch! We were just hanging out. Man, he's like, Justin like that guy that'll give like everyone else a bad name. Oh, yeah. Like remember when he told Stephanie P that she should... I don't... I don't wanna say it actually. He's just trying to get in your pants, - I can tell you that much. - Ew, Adam! Besides, you're... you're too young to be going to parties. I don't know what you're thinking. Dude, you are nine months older than me. ...opportunity. Wardrobe infraction. Can we speak alone? Freshman. Hey. Uh, some of us are going to Ethan's after school, and you should totally come. - Um, yeah, I can probably go. - Dope. See you there. Cool. What? A sophomore, just like came... Yeah, it was really cool. - What? - I know! You're so close. I just got him. Damn it! Got him, I got him. Hey. Does Adam know you're here? Adam? Adam, yeah no, um, I doubt it, but I did see him this morning, so that was... Or no that was last night, it was definitely last night. Maybe it was yesterday. I don't remember maybe we should call him. Yeah, um, I'm good. Damn it! What's up, Watson? - Do you know each other? - Yeah... - We're neighbors. - We're neighbors. Cool. Well, I was thinking, because you're like, the smartest girl in the history class... Um. No, it really only seems like that, but it's just 'cause I'm like one of the only freshmen, I'm not that smart. Yeah, well, I think you're smart. Dude! - Don't you forget. - Okay. It seems like he was gonna ask you to do his homework, right? Yeah, it totally did. If I were you, I don't know I... tell him you were blind or something. Yeah. Actually though uh, I have to get going, but it was good talking to you. Uh, can I come? I have something to do later. Yeah, yeah. Uh, hey Justin, I'm gonna get going, I have something to do for my mom, so... Gotta help your mom. Kidding, freshie, see ya later. Okay. - The leaves are like... - You two... - Sorry. - Um. No, no, you can go. Shoot. I was just gonna say, leaves are like really cool. Yeah. So, um, what do you think of high school so far? Um, it's okay, it's pretty much like Hosford but bigger. I have classes with my friends which is nice. I like my English class. I don't like that they are making me take Spanish too, but the counsellor says I have to try, so... What about you? Uh, I don't know. It's alright. I'm kinda used to it by now. I like drama. Oh yeah, you're supposed to be like... I just mean to say, you're supposed to be really good. Shit. Hmm. What? I don't know, it's just... it's just weird. I don't think we have ever really talked before. I don't totally know you. Oh. Um, I have this thing, in my room, I don't know if you'd want to see. Really? Yeah or not, I mean. No, um, yeah, yeah, that sounds good. It's my little leaf collection. Oh, wow. Yeah. I mean I'm kinda seeing how shitty they look after some time. But you know, once they were all bright and beautifully colored. Like this one, I don't know it's probably from like the fifth grade. Really? Yeah. Wow. So, now you know. I like leaves, too. Um, do you wanna smoke? Oh, I... I didn't realize you smoke. Oh, yeah, I mean I like to sometimes, 'cause just around people, I don't know, I feel weird. But like I only have a little bit. I got it from my sister's friend. Uh, I don't do it that often, so... I've only smoked like twice, and once was today, and one other time. I don't really even know if it counted. Um, yeah actually I'll... I'll take some more. Thanks. Okay. Okay. Okay. Would you like to do the honors? Yeah, sure. Okay. Thank you. I'm... I'm good. You guys look pretty funny there. Oh, yeah, that was like, a year ago. Wow. I should've been nice to you All this time Um, I should probably go. Yeah. Yeah. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. Uh, I don't know I mean, it's an amazing photo. Yeah, what kinda class is that? We just take fucking photos you know, it's kind of like a college level class. Like a college level class? Yeah. For a sophomore year, it's pretty good. Hey, so is it lasagne night tonight? Is it lasagne night tonight? Okay, fine, don't tell me if it's lasagne night. Oh, um, I don't know. Later. I'm just not really sure. Harper! Harper! Harper! It's trash night. Yeah. Hey. Oh, hi. Um. So how are you? I'm... I'm good. Uh, I was just, you know. Uh, do you...? Yeah. Yeah. Umm... What... what have you been up to? Um, I mean, just like stuff. Homework stuff, basketball stuff. What about you? Yeah, you know like theater things. I had a rehearsal yesterday. And that's about it. Oh yeah, you're um, you're playing Duke Fredrick in As You Like It, right? Yeah, yeah, I'm kind of excited, 'cause I didn't really have any big parts last year. Well, you're gonna be really good. I mean, that's just... that's what everyone else is saying. So did you end up doing Justin's homework? What? Oh, um, no actually. He asked me about it yesterday, but um, I just told him to ask Mr. Summers for help, think he might. Really? I mean, that's what he said. I had Mr. Summers last year and I really liked him. - Oh really? - Yeah... I had him for English. The triumph of the South Atlantic system changed the politics of the empire. British would pretend to rule the colonies with a gentle hand and the colonists were in a position to challenge... In England glorious revolution strengthened the powers of the colonists at the expense of the Crown. American representative assemblies also wished to limit the powers of the Crown, grab the one control... Um, is... is Adam home? He... he has my math notes like, so I came by to... Yeah. Yeah. Adam! Um, you can just come in actually. - Oh! - Um. I... I forgot my... I was just, uh... Um, but I... I can get it. Or I can get it for you, if you want. Yeah. Um, why... why were you out here anyway? Um, it's trash day, so. What? We should hang out sometime. Okay. Um, well, I should probably go, so. - Yeah. - Um, okay. Hey, um, did you come out here just to see me? Yeah. Did you? Yeah. So um, what do you think about politics? What? Sorry, I don't know. No, no. Um, let's see, I don't know it's all pretty crazy and terrible, right? Like my dad, he says it's a shitshow. Mine, too. I don't know for me, I think it's more about like, women's abortion rights. Yeah? Yeah, I mean not like for me personally, necessarily. I just think, where I come from it's so much more complicated. And people die every single day just trying to do it themselves, so I just think that like... I just think that sometimes women deserve more than they get. Yeah. Sorry, what part of India are you from again? Uh, Kanar. In like this little village actually. So um, my birth mom, she had me and the guy who was my dad left right away, I guess. And um, she couldn't afford to keep me, so when I was 3 she moved me to an orphanage in Delhi, and so my parents now Jocelyn and Bob, uh, they found me through an online program and here I am. I remember the day you came. No, you don't. I was 3, so you would have been 4. - There's no way. - Okay, yeah. Maybe not, but I do remember being really little and playing with you, and... oh and then I do remember when Adam came, yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, you guys were 6 I remember that. - Hey, you know what's crazy? - What? My parents just went to India and Saint Paul and got some children. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. So, like do you ever think about your family? Like your old family? Yeah, sometimes. I mean, sometimes this lady who says she's my cousin sends me letters. They're kind of funny and kind of weird. - Woah. - Yeah, I don't know. - Um... - Well, it was fun hanging out. - Yeah, yeah, um... - I... Are you going that way? - Yeah. - Okay. I should probably cross it, so. - I'll just... - Yeah. I almost told the guy to step the fuck away I was so pissed! Mom, you can't talk to the mayor like that. It's not normal, but in this case he would've deserved it, that piece of sh... Oh, so how's school, Adam? Um, it's okay. I mean, you know the treasurer and I have a lot of good ideas, but I wish she was vice president. She's a lot easier to deal with than Jonathan. Well, you just need to give Jonathan some time. They elected him for a reason. Harper, how are you doing? What? What do you think of the school, sweetie? - It's big, huh? - Yeah! It is big. Um, it's pretty cool. I like it. I'm doing very good, thank you. There's Mark. You know, we really should have him over soon. Feel bad, it's been a while. Yeah, me too, me too. How's Tilly doing? Does he ever talk about his mom? Uh, not really. - I... I think he's okay. - Hmm. It was really sad watching her go like that. I mean nobody should have to go through something like that. Especially not Tilly And they were sparkly and gorgeous. How was your day? Are you dating Luna Douglas? What? No. Um, do you like her, though? No, no, no. We just hang out with the same people. So we're around each other a lot. She's nice. Yeah. Are you dating Joey Gomez? What? I mean that was in like the sixth grade, so it was a long time ago. I guess I was going out with Owen McDonald, but whatever that's... Hey, do we think anything about um, about Adam? Yeah, I do. Me too. I mean I don't know, this is cool. This is weird. You know what I hate? When I'm trying to perform my summer dance routine - and I go... - Oh my God! No one will ever let me forget about that! You guys chose the block party to premiere your world famous dance. It would've been world famous, it literally would have been! - Who's playing Rosalind? - Oh, um, my friend Luna. Guys, how's school? It's good, Mr. D. - How are you? - Oh good, good, good, good. Make sure you try some of the sauce, Bob. - It's my grandma's recipe. - Okay. Mark, it is so nice of you to have prepared all of this, although when we said we should have dinner, we didn't mean that you should have us like come... Oh yeah. No, no, no, no, don't worry about it, I... - I love cooking. - Okay. It's fine, yeah. I do, Tilly. Yeah, yeah, I mean we have like frozen burritos like every night. Yeah. Mark um... Hey, uh, how's... how's Carol doing? Good, good, yeah. I think she's not crazy about being on the same campus as me, but I told her that's what you'd get for choosing the old hippie school, right. Yeah, I kinda wouldn't mind going to an old hippie school. Or at least I'm starting to think that. Last week I got in trouble, because a teacher thought my shorts weren't inappropriate. What he was saying was just shaming the way our bodies look or the way our clothes fit. It's just, isn't it society that's telling us to wear these clothes just so we fit in? I don't know, it just kinda sucks. Yeah. Harper, I couldn't agree with you more. I was having this exact conversation with my students just the other day, - about that double standard. - Oh. It's... it's just so backwards, you know, all of it. And you two, it's time to start standing up for women, okay. It's not like it used to be, at all. It's not like uh, "Oh, uh, happy to make more money" or whatever, no. You see something unfair, you fucking change it. You say something and you change it. Okay, so... I went into professor mode for a second there. You did! Okay, go to the one with the pig, that's the wrong one. This is like three summers ago. Well, it's still funny, so. - No way! - This is... - I love this one. - That's mom's panda, show her. - Mom! - Mom, look, it's your panda! Mom! It's your child, the panda... Thank you so much, thank you. Yeah, it was nice, really nice. - Bye for now. - Bye. - Thanks for dinner. - Yeah. - Bye. - Adam, see ya. - Bye. - Bye. - That was nice. - Yeah. So loved it. That was good. Hey. Hey, so what do you wanna do? Um, I don't know. I think... It should be an adventure. I think it should be a date. - What? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing. Hey, can you believe that I would never, ever, ever wanna go... Hmm? To the moon. - Why? - 'Cause you can't breathe. Like literally think about it. Well, I feel like you would have some way to breathe if you ended up finding a way to get to the moon. No, this is like you going. Okay, okay, okay. Continue. Um, probably North Carolina. No, no, no, no, no. - I don't eat... - What? It's veggie. Vegetable! Okay. I don't eat meat either. Since when? You know, I've been a vegetarian since I was 8, right? Yeah. I remember we would always go to the beach and you'd make a really big deal out of when my parents made hot dogs. But I don't know, it's been like, a few years after my mom got sick, so she stopped eating, so I stopped as well. And then after... it just like, seemed weird to go back. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. It's not. Real emotional, huh. Sorry. Very sincere. I'm sorry, Tilly! Well, um, I think that was a success. A success? Um, what do you wanna do now? I mean, we should probably keep hanging out, right. I think my dad might have a late class, um, would you wanna come over? I mean I should probably text him, but what do your parents think if you're galloping around town? You mean gallivanting? But no, yeah, they're cool with it. They trust us. They're trying to be so progressive that I have nothing to rebel against, so. Um, but actually, I'll them I'm going to Zoey's. I'll be right back. - Hi. - Hi. Dad late indeed. So, um, what do you wanna do? - Um, we could eat. - Yeah. Or I guess, we just ate already. Um, we could smoke? I don't know, sure. Or we could, drink a beer. My dad has beer. Yeah, yeah. I like beer. Or I'm... I'm starting to. My mom actually drinks a lot, of beer, nothing crazy. She's just... she's very Portland. She gets mad about politics and stuff. So, that's where you get it? I mean, that's an interesting way of thinking about it. I guess. But doesn't everyone get mad? I guess so. Um. I guess I don't really need a beer. Okay. Do you want to? Yeah. This is fun. Yeah. Um, should I? I mean, if... if you want to. Yeah. I haven't done it before. I mean me neither. Really? Yeah, I mean like, we don't have to. Go, go get a condom. Wait. I... I don't have one. Do you think my dad would? I don't know, go check. Okay. Is... is this crazy? Yes! Uh. Well, I'll see you later. Yeah. Bye. Can I come over later? Oh, uh, I have... I have rehearsal in an hour, so. Wait, so we can't do it again? No, I mean we're definitely doing it again. When though? Not... not till tomorrow? I think we should do it all the time. You wanna? You were looking at me! No! You were looking at me! Oh my God! I was gonna come over and I was gonna say something, but then Madison looked at me weird. Okay, well, Madison looks at everyone weird. It's so weird not seeing you during the day. I know. You know that day you texted me at the food carts? I didn't know if I should come or not. I am so glad you came. Me too. Although I'm pretty sure that day we just talked. No, that day we... No. You are remembering wrong. You are remembering incorrectly. No! I disagree! Is this better than what Madison likes? No. My dad likes it, and it's... and it's cool. Um, that's because he's 40. - So when I'm 44, you'll be 45? - Yeah. And when I'm 52, you're gonna be 51. And when I'm 81, you're gonna be 82. We're gonna be so happy. We're gonna be so old. Hey! - Is it okay that I decided to? - Yeah. I'm so happy you're here. Struberry. Strawberry. It's struberry, it sounds like January. Struberry. Yeah, struberry. Harper Ann! Mom! Harper Ann, are you having sex with Tilly Dodson? We're just friends, mom, that's it. Yeah, you've become more than friends and you know it. Well, kind of, but yeah, kind of, but... Yep. No, you were over there yesterday, too. - I thought you trusted us, mom. - Trust? Look, kids spending every day together in unsupervised rooms are having sex, Harper. No, they're not. Look, I would know. Uh. I just don't want you having sex. Why not? Because you are too young. No, I'm not. Turney, what do you think? Him? Definitely like her. Him for sure. Virgins. Her too. Probably. Probably? Definitely. Probably never had a guy who'd check her out on accident. Um, hey, do you know what we're supposed to do for this essay? What? Um, do you know what you're doing right now? I heard it was in a tree house. I heard she was on her period. And apparently, she asked to wait till she was, so she wouldn't know if the blood was from. Oh my God. - Guys, this is kinda gross. - Yeah. No, like, that we know this stuff. Are you just saying that, 'cause you're getting all the action now? Yeah, maybe. Why did you say it like that? It's just gross. Oh my God! So what is it like? Um, I guess it's just kind of like knowing someone really, really well, but differently than everyone else you know. Yeah. I wish my first sexual experience wasn't having hands stuck down my pants. He should've been expelled, really. It's okay, I mean, I just Tiger. I just felt stupid mostly. Uh, I never should've told my mom. Well, he shouldn't have assumed you wanted that just because you shared a locker. Yeah, well, see you in history. See ya. What's up with you and Adam Turney's sister? Woah, you really like her. Yeah, I mean, she's super funny, and smart, and like really into government, and like she has all these ideas about how school should be run, and she's like... I don't know, she's really into basketball, so I get to watch her practices. She's just kinda awesome. Nice. How are you? Good, how are you? - I'm good. - That's cool. So what do you wanna do today? I don't know, I think it's up to you. You probably haven't really been in here before. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think I've been in here since... I don't know when I would've been here actually. For a basketball, maybe? Yeah, I feel like me and Adam might have come in here once when you were gone. I'm sorry, look, I would never do that now. We might have looked at your dolls without their clothes on or something really weird. Yeah, that is pretty weird. Well, we should probably do it. I mean, my mom's working late and my dad's to uh, Lake Oswego. Adam has a student council meeting. So... Yeah, but I should do homework after. Mhmm. Hey, do you ever wanna like, do it differently? Yeah, how do you mean? Like, like this? Like this? - Come on, come on. - Hey, cradle-robber. Hey, do I need to hide my sister? You eat more bagels than anyone I've ever met. I love bagels. Hey, um, Abby got her tooth pulled and I was thinking after school we should all go over and bring her homework. Mom said we can watch Super Bowl there. Oh, um, I actually was gonna watch Tilly's rehearsal - after school today. - Oh. - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. See you later. Hey. I think he might have said something to my mom, if it makes you feel better. Really? Actually, I don't really know. But he's ignoring me too, so. Yeah, I mean, it's just different. Um, but, thanks, thanks Harper. Yeah. Did you hear what happened in Geometry class? No, what happened? Okay, so the projector stopped working and we gotta be in our phones, all class. Oh, lucky! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Abby! Um, how's... how's your tooth? Um, it's fine I guess, I mean I can't really tell now that it's gone. Um, kind of hurts now. Actually, talking about it right now kind of hurts more. What's Sam Pierson like, Tilly? Yeah, is he always running around with his shirt off, like ugh, look at how sexy I am. I mean, not really. He's... he's really nice. But what's he like? I don't know. Just normal, I... I guess. I remember that cheer you guys used to do at basketball games when you were younger. That was... that was cool. That's weird. Yeah, isn't that like sexist? Yeah. They're just joking, you're fine. You guys are joking, right? I think I'm just gonna do homework today. Yeah, me too. Hey. Oh, hi. So I was thinking maybe after school going to hang out with Ethan and like, some of those guys. Oh, cool, yeah. Um, you know what, maybe I'll hang out with Zoey and Madison, I think they're going Halloween shopping, so. Okay, um, text me when you get home. I can run out or something. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, bye. Bye. - Okay, okay, okay. - You got this! You got this! Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, wait. - You got it, you got it! - I know. You're so close! I'm going off. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Wait, no! No! No! Ugh! Nice try. Well, new government awaits. Hey, bro. Hey. Um, I could not figure out that thing in math today, uh. Oh, shit. Is this what you're doing to Adam's sister, Dodson? Dude, I... I just meant like, I mean, you should it, you should see this shit. Plus, I hear that girl's a slut. I mean you would know. And you. Hey, um, so did you want me to come to your rehearsal today? I know you have your big homeless wanderer scene. Um, yeah. Yeah, I don't know, it might take a little bit before I have you seeing me as a hermit in a cave. Well, I think you'd be a great hermit, you know, you'd stock up on bread, and Pop Rocks, and you'd have your little radio playing jazz. Yeah, yeah, and you'd like, sneak in 50 cucumber rolls and like a YBM poster. Okay. Okay, so he's like this uptight king, right, and he's like, "No, you can't be with my niece", and then he meets this homeless wanderer, but that's the scene he's doing today, so tomorrow... Okay, I don't mean to be rude, but I like don't care. Okay, that's fair, but you have to come to his opening day with me. There's no way I can make Adam. Yeah, fine. Hey, you know who's kinda cute? Uh, that guy Eli, he has the locker like really close to mine. Or him. Hey Harper. Hey? Abby. What's going on? Nothing much, we're... we're pretty good. Cool. Well, say hi to your brother for me. Okay. And your boyfriend. I will! Why are all your brother's friends hot? Why?! What? You're like stalking me now? You're my best friend, Adam, and... and I don't wanna bum you out. Then why are you doing something that's bumming me out? Whatever, man. What did you think would happen when you decided to lose your virginity to my sister? That we'd still just hang out and watch The Flash? It's not happening, dude. Hey, what's up? I can't. I just I can't. Adam... Tilly, what's wrong? It's like we're all hanging out, you know playing video games in the basement, Dodson and Turney were there, then all of a sudden, Turney was like, "Fuck you, dude!" and he was like flippin' out! Hey Justin, what are you talking about? I mean I... I heard Adam's name, so I was just wondering. Look, Liam's the one who called you a slut. - That wasn't me. - What? You know, 'cause, you've had sex with like three dudes. And Liam was just telling Adam what he already knew. And so I was like, I was like, "I don't even know you", you know? Like there was no, no possible way that I was gonna... So he's just like, he's getting like way up in my space. I'm like, "Who you tryna fight?" You know, he's tryna fight, bro. Hey Liam! Yeah? What makes you think if you can tell someone's a virgin or not? Well, I mean, I heard you talking about how I'm not one and we all know you make a game out of pointing out everyone else. Is it if someone's throwing themselves at you or not or maybe it's the way their makeup is or how they dress. Maybe it's their shorts. Or is if someone's had hands down their pants or not. You have no idea what you're talking about. See you in history. Um, what do you wanna do? I don't know. Liam's such a dick. I'm sorry Liam said those things. Yeah, I mean, it's... it's complete bullshit. Anyway, what's going on between you and Adam, though? I don't know. I mean, he's really pissed. He's never really liked this. Us, you know. Yeah. But whatever. Yeah. Yeah, it's whatever. Um, do you wanna keep watching this? Um, not really. - Wait, I didn't know that. - Really? - Yeah. - Yeah. I thought I told you that earlier. Oh my God, what instrument? Uh, a trumpet. Okay, bye. Bye. Hi. I heard Henry's throwing a party tonight, are you gonna go? If you do, please don't bring him. Uh, well... What's up? Um, we haven't talked about it. But if Tilly wants to, then maybe. Oh my God, do you even listen to a word I say? Wait, how are your parents letting you go? - Maddie, your mom is... - I'm sneaking out. I have my story straight and everything. I'm super ready. Are you guys dressing up? MADISON and ABBY: Yeah! So what's up with your girlfriend and Liam Erwell? Why are you always asking about my girlfriend anyway? I don't know. Plus, I mean apparently she grabbed his dick yesterday. I just thought there'd be a story. What? Oh, are you going to Ben Linkson's party tonight? Sorry, Tilly, I thought you knew. I'm... I'm gonna go to class. Okay. Bye. Is it weird to be in your dad's bathroom? Um, I mean not really, it's kind of both of ours, so. I don't know. Well, I meant like, here with me. Oh, no, it's fine. Okay, cool. Are you ready to go? Are you sure you wanna go? Yeah. Yeah, why? Why wouldn't I wanna go? Why wouldn't you want me to go? No, that's... that's not what I meant. I just... never mind. Okay, let's go. Trick or treat. Um, so. Hey guys. Holy shit, it's the dick grabber. Hey, man. How's Harper? Oh, she's... she's cool. So my brother dropped my ball yesterday, it went everywhere. I wanna go to my mom about it, but then she'll be like, "Hey, this is good for you." Oh it's fine, she doesn't like him anyways. What? You just need to chill, Tilly. Harper is an independent woman. She just needs her butterfly time. 'Cause, she's a beautiful butterfly, you know. Why are you telling me this? Look, Turney. I'm not mad about what you did. If you weren't with Dodson, I'd ask you to do it again. I think you're dumber being with him anyway. We told her that, too. Dick grabber! Where's Dodson? Harper! Harper! Harper! Harper! Hey. Do you wanna go? Yeah, yeah. You're right. Yeah, Dodson. Dude. - What gives? - What? You've been in a shit mood all night and I'm the one who has... - You're the one who what? - Nothing. Just I'm the one who has to deal with Liam and all those other jerks. So I don't understand what your problem is. Yeah, well, then why were you even hanging out with Liam anyways? It's not like I wanted, too, he just kidnapped my friends, okay? Yeah, and I... I bet you didn't wanna touch his dick either. How do you know about that? Tilly! Tilly! I like you. And I've never said anything to you about this, but I hear stuff about you. Stuff like... like you're a slut, or... This is what I'm talking about, Tilly. You have no idea. You're so busy feeling hurt about Adam, that you don't bother to think about what it's like for me, for girls. I have sex with you, only you. And all of a sudden, I'm like this slut. And you have sex and you're part of some cool boys club. And you're the one who touched Liam's dick, so just fucking tell me what that's about, and wait, don't actually. Abby pretty much told me that you already had feelings - for someone else. - What? I don't. I don't know, Harper. Part of me just thinks that, that we should... That we should what? I don't know, break up. Okay. Wait, what? You wanna break up? Yeah, sure. I mean if you're gonna keep freaking out about Adam and my friends are gonna think I'm lame for hanging out with you and everyone is gonna have something to say about it, then yeah, why the hell not? Harper, I... No one likes us together, don't you get it? So neither do I. Just leave me alone. Give me my own block, I deserve at least that. Don't say that! I can breakdance, did you know that? It's more of a pop and lock situation. - See that so? - Nope. Did you see that? Woah, woah! Woah! Sup Dodson? What are you, gay or something? I don't think so. Are you? Not me. Hi. Um, I thought it'd be less weird if... it's just if you came over, it'd be like... I thought you would need these, especially this. How... how's it going? Honestly, I don't even know. Me neither. Are you okay? Yeah, I... I don't know. I'm still... Yeah. - Thanks for... - Yeah. For these, yeah... Yeah um, I should get going I have homework anyway, so... How dare ye?! Did I offend your highness? Thus do all traitors if their purgation did consist in words, they are innocent as grace itself. Let it suffice that I trust thee not. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor. Tell me whereon the likelihood depends. Thou art thy father's daughter, that's enough. Halt! O excellent, young man! If I had thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down! That's enough. That's enough. No and yes, and no and yes, and no and yes, and no and yes, and no and yes, and no and yes, and no and yes. That was so fun. Yeah, that was really fun. I can't wait until next year. Yeah, what are we gonna do next year? - What's... - Maybe Romeo and Juliet. - That would be... - That's so awesome. Yeah. Dude, you were... you were so good! - Good job! - Thank you. Yeah. You were really good, Tilly. Thanks. You were great. - Isn't he good? - Yeah. Yeah, super good. - Go, go, go. - Yes, yes, yes! - Come on, no! - Yes! - Go! - No, I! - Yes! - Go, Go! No! No! No! - I won! - You cheater! You cheater! - How did I cheat? - I won! I won! I won! I won! I won! I won! ...this one graphic novel. But my teacher said that there's too many vicarious to account for my... Hey Harper! Hey, Josh. How's it going? Sing! Sing me a song! Sing us a song, Adam. And that's why racial tolerance and inclusivity are important parts of feminism. Actually, most. Because, without them, women will never truly be free. You know, I agree Harper, but... Personally, Mr. Sloan, I don't think there's any room for buts. Our generation isn't gonna tolerate buts when it comes to equality for women regardless of race. I mean, just ask the internet. Yeah, I... I think she's right. Harper, we... we have a few minutes. Do you have any thoughts you wanna share about why you think women of color have traditionally been oppressed? Um, yeah. Yeah, I do. Hey. Are you walking to school? Um, are you sad the play's over? Yeah, I mean, it's always really hard working on something for so long and then, I don't know. It's just... it's just over. Thanks for coming by the way. Yeah, I mean I was glad to, actually. Um, I guess, just to finally see all the hard work pay off. But I don't know, I mean yeah, everything's... everything's going good. I'm starting a debate club after Christmas break. So... I don't know. It's just something my teacher recommended, really. But it will be cool to try. I got another letter from India, from my cousin or whatever. Yeah? What did it... what did it say? Well, apparently there was a storm. And her goat died, unfortunately. Um, the power went out, but it's back now. Sometimes I... I reread these letters and I just wonder if... am I really related to her? Or is she just some woman that's tryna mess with me, you know? I don't know, you could write back and like, pretend to be someone completely different. Um, but then again don't take my advice. Maybe... maybe you like the letters. What do you... what do you have for lunch today? Well, my dad made me a sushi wrap, but I think I'm gonna go with a burrito today. What about you? I kind of want a pizza.
