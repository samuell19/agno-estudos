Villains of the world, In three days when the clock strikes midnight and the Chinese New Year begins, this bad boys' power is gonna be unleashed. With the power of the Zodiac, we're gonna take out the anti villain league. And The Vicious 6 will be the most powerful villains on the planet. Can you dig it? What dig it? Do I dig it? I don't dig it. There's nothing to dig. They thought they could leave me for dead, huh? Kick me to the curb like a piece of old meat. Oh. They got no idea what's coming? Oh. I'm gonna make them suffer for what they have done to me. -Oh boy. -Hey, Mr. Knuckles. What?! We uhh... just wanted to make sure we be getting paid this week. What about value? I'm paying you with knowledge. You are? Lesson one, always be prepared. Lesson two, The Belguim Five-arm Nose-Pinch. And lesson 3, The Lithuanian Haircut. That's worth all the money in the world. Hey guys, forget about it. You're going to get paid. But first, we got to get my stone back. I see a bad Gru arising. I see I'm feeling on his way. I'm going now in the room with my heroes. They're gonna love me because I'm the best. Don't mess up tonight. You're going to join The Vicious 6. Here is the bad Gru and did I... Guys... Oh, you want to come? Right, right... Okay... When you guys tracked me down and responded to my help, what did happen? I was like "who are these tiny tater tots?" "And where did they get so much denim?" And you're just wouldn't quit. All right, I surrender. Come on in. We've had some great times since then, But the thing is... The Vicious 6, they're the big leagues. And you guys... are... great... and so the job you did with the lair. A plus. It's just what I was thinking is that there are a lot of other villains in the world. You know? Never mind. Look. I think I just need to fly solo. See you later, alligator. Here we go. Excuse me. Sir? I was wondering if you're no good. You're good. My mistake. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I was just trying out this new invention of mine. I call it "sticky fingers" or "smart goo." I haven't quite landed on the name yet. Come here. I overheard you were looking for something... Special. I yes, I was hoping you're no good. I think you'll enjoy listening in Booth 3. Right this way. This is it. Mums the word. Keep it down. Good luck. Let her have it, son. Thanks mister Nefario. That's Doctor Nefario. Here are the package. If you ever get famous, remember who gave you your first gadget. Okay. Try backwards. Welcome to The Vicious 6. That's pretty... Hello. Everybody here for the interview? Me too. So what do you guys got going on later? Are you up to no good? Are you gonna get into some mischief? Bring the first one in. They're ready to see you Mr. Gru. Oh, good good. Distinguished villains, My name is Gru. I feel like I'm talking too loud, even though our proximity doesn't require this kind of volume. If you told me when I was ten, if I would have the chance to fill the shoes of my favorite villain ever, Wild Knuckles I would say "you got rocks in your head," but now that I'm 11 and 3/4 it makes a lot more sense. All right, who let the kid in? I thought he was this tiny man. What's wrong with you? You seriously think a puny little child can be a villain. Umm... Yes. I'm pretty despicable. You don't want to cross me. Evil is for adults, who steal powerful ancient stones and wreak havoc, and not for tubby little pups who should be at school learning taking a recess. Suck, I can't stop. Come back when you've done something to impress me. Who's next? I am Wingman, the next member of The Vicious 6. Behold, the power of flight, Sir. All right, joke's over. Show time. right Bring him in. Bring him in, boys! He took the stone. Caught him! Lock down the building. I did... nothing to see here. Oh, look at you. Frampton Comes Alive! Nice choice. I uh... Just keep walking. Look at that. A kid? Guys. What are you doing here? Okay. Just get on. -Which way did he go? -There is that little thief. -Knock knock. Delivery! The demon child! Otto, take the stone back to the lair. I'll distract them. No, not now. Come on, come on. Yeah, baby. I'll handle this. Hope you enjoy the rest of your short life. Please work. Come on, come on, come on. We're coming for you, tiny man! They all said a kid wouldn't be a real villain. We-he-ell... This kid just stole something from the worst villains in the world. When I bring it back to them, they're going to say... "We have made a terrible mistake." "Please join us." "Please Gru" and I will say... Yes! I will be the newest member of The Vicious 6. Now all I need is Otto. Where is Otto? No, not "Otto le komay" He needs to come in now. -Otto! -Mini boss! There you are... You got it? Is this... Are you pulling on my legs right now? Otto, where's the stone? What about you? Come up. Did you just trade my future? For a pet rock?! Okay, I'll go... Where was this birthday party? This is unacceptable. Unacceptable! I told you guys that you weren't ready for the big leagues and you have proven me correct. All you do is mess everything up. Ugh! What?! My mom was right. You do not belong here. You're fired. I'm going to find that stone. When I get home, you all better be gone. And Otto, close your yapper! I'll say goodbye. No one ever cared if I should leave. Kevin, no, I will be better off on my own. I'm sorry. I thought you'll be impressed Can I just speak to Belle Bottom? Wild Knuckle! You're alive? Wow, my favorite villain is also my kidnapper. This could be a great opportunity if you don't kill me. Shut up and give me the stone. Ahh. Yes. The stone. Here's the thing about that. It's kind of a funny story. Give it to him. It's all going to go south very quickly. What the heck is this? Where is it, boy? I don't have it, I don't have it. I know you're hiding it somewhere. I'm not, I'm not. I swear. Cross my heart and hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye. Don't actually do that though. Somebody bring me a phone. Call home. It's ransom time. No, no, no. My mom will probably pay you to keep me. Good one. Call! Who is this? Kevin lay what? You kidding me? You got henchmen? Well, that's the end of that. Listen, you. Bring the stone to me in San Francisco. 6830 Green Street, got it? Now you got two days or you are never gonna see your little boss again. Oh ho ho... The stone. Gave that to my uncle. It's more his style. I told you, I don't know where he went you stupid Twinkies. Not cool, man. San Francisco. Let's rock and roll. Time to get our stone back. We're coming for you, Mr. Gru. Hallelujah! San Francisco. Okay. How will you be paying? Oh great. You know, if you have any hairballs, we can upgrade you to 1st class. Get out. And I had to turn back at LaGuardia. Hey Dolly. AD STARTING IN 40:14, ENDS IN 40:45. SKIP FOR 30 SECONDS. Oh. Yes, please. You got real moxie kid, stealing from The Vicious 6. I got moxie, really? Did I just receive a compliment from Wild Knuckles? All my dreams are coming true right now. Well, it's about to become your nightmare. Welcome to my newest torture device. Disco inferno. Your minions better get it by sundown tomorrow because if 48 hours of disco won't kill you, the blade will. Oooh! No, no, no, no, no. Go go go. Next up, Green Street. Wait a minute. Trespassers! Come back here. Get your little butts back here. OK, now. You might feel a little pinch. Got you now. Time to bring some fun. Any plans for the weekend? Take five deep breaths. I'll be right back. You like picking on little guys, huh? Go take a nap, old lady. Old lady? I am a master of the ancient Shaolin Art of Kung Fu. No. Get lost. If you come back to our place, you're dead. Shh shh shh... You can thank me by going away. I'm working. You? Want to learn Kung Fu? My teaching days are over. This is my life now. Fine. I will teach you. Hey, those are not for you. The name of the game is sell, sell, sell. Where is Gru? How should I know? What's with the costumes? Halloween was four months ago. You look stupid. Buzz off. Shoo. I'm getting my meat tenderizer. Let me help you with that, dearie. Now, where's the boy? I didn't mean to scare you. Don't worry, we're not mad at him. We just want to... hire him. Where is it? Wild Knuckles? He's alive? And working with the kid? We're going to San Francisco. Let's hit it. You had better be paying for my roof. Pretty groovy, huh? [BASIC SKILLS] We begin with a basic kick. Now, you. Okay... No kicking. This is a melon hammer. It's a weapon. This is Fred. He is a dummy. Never underestimate a dummy. Now, attack. Don't tell to me "I cannot break this wood." But doubt exists only in the mind. You know what I say to my mind. Now, you. kevin kevin kenny Okay. Clearly, we are not ready for philosophy. Let's just train. Rest up. Tomorrow's going to be even worse. What? You're quitting? I told you, when I get that stone, We're going to be unstoppable. I have had enough. There's nothing sadder than an aging villain. So long, old man. Guys, come on. We're a team. Hope you like it. Is this? I just had to fire my henchman. You know why? Because they weren't getting the job done. OK, I'm just gonna untie you now because I I I I need you to do some stuff for me around the house. You might be, you know, kind of nice to have a little company around here. Oh, yeah. Villains just doing some chores. Who knows what kind of trouble we could get into. What's that? -That's your evil chuckle? -Obviously. Well, it stinks. You sound like a clown who swallowed a kazoo. Really? Well, you look like a wizard going through an end of life crisis. Easy now, Don Rickles. Who's Don Rickles? [RATTLESNAKES XING] Dude. I thought we lost you there for a minute. Hey, chill, chill. You wanna try this one, little dude? Hey soul brother, where jetting off to? Disco Frisco! It's so lucky day chick I'm heading up the coast. I could drop you off on the way. [WORLD'S BIGGEST BANANA] Start with the pool. This place gotta be spick and span. What are you doing? You look like the overcooked turkey my mom makes on Thanksgiving. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the pool is filled with my pet crocodiles. Yeah, well, well... doesn't scare me. Be careful. I can't have you lose an arm because they need you to change some light bulbs after this, yeah. I'll show you how it's done. Knock it off. Hey. Whoa! Oh, no. Marvin, no, no. Stop that. The net. I got you. I got you. I got you. I don't got you. Take my hand. Got you. You could have ran. But you... But you didn't. I told you, you were my favorite villain in the world. I could not let you get eaten by crocodiles. Even though that would have been kinda cool to watch. So... So you want to be a great villain, huh? That's all I ever wanted. You want to, I don't know, you want me... You want me to teach you a thing or two? Many fighters have asked me, "how did I become a great master?" [FINDING YOUR INNER BEAST] Even the smallest of us are capable of great things. You just dig down deep, find your inner beast, and... Now, you try. Find your inner beast. Stop this kick. We have a lot more work to do. Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, you are ready. No, no, no, no, no. Ready for your Kung Fu junior chievement badges. They're dead. First rule of heist, always stay in character.

I'm so grateful for I've been thinking about how you won't see me grow up or be there for all the terrible things that I'm going to do. Believe me, they're gonna some awful things But I'm going to make you proud. I'm going to be the best villain ever because of you. Because you taught me what matters, you can't do anything alone. Find your tribe. And never ever let them go. Otto. You better stay out of trouble, kid. I will live a good and honest life. You're alive? You just blew my mind. How could you do that?
