You raised these boys with your screwy little books and your hippie seminars. And Peel, you got him in a goddamn vise-grip. It's called love, Howard. But I guess you wouldn't know about that.

So I just need you to sign this and you can go. What is it? Just some legal hoo-ha. I wouldn't concern myself with it. She didn't leave me anything? No, she left you 2500 in her savings account, plus the house. - The house? - Yes, sir. All yours. - What about my brothers? - Don't know. I can tell you she took out a second mortgage and your payments are about 800 a month. How am I supposed to do that? You could sell the house. Or you can rent out a couple of rooms. I don't know, I'm not a life coach, son. Great. Do you think you could help me find my brothers? Sure. Try this. Is this 411? OPERATOR [ON PHONE]: Yes. City and state, please?

Mama said we could turn the heat up, but never over 75 degrees. No, Peel. I'm talking about a party, man. Chuck and I have been here for, what, a couple weeks now? Look at the three of us. What are we doing? Sitting around here with nothing but our own dicks to twirl. - I've never had a party. - What? Peel, you're a grown-ass man, you've never had yourself a party? Peel, that pains me, man. That right there is criminal. Peel, we're throwing you an old-fashion soiree, muchacho. Pool party. A pool party. But I don't know anyone. Don't you worry about a lick of that, man. We'll have this place teeming with a coalition of cuties beyond your wildest, my friend. What about your little girlfriend there, Mulan? Chun Ja. - She's not my girlfriend. - You like her? [LAUGHS] You like her. Why don't you invite her for a little dip, a little swim together?

You definitely don't know any people. Pizza man don't count. We're gonna have to find someone who does, right? Someone who can attract the right kind of people. A babe magnet, man. All right?

We're talking about your manhood. Your manhood, Peel. Right? This mama's-boy thing you got going on... Mm-mm. Gotta go, man. It's gotta go. What would Chun Ja say about renting out the room?

Give it to me. Sam? William? WILL: Uh. Yeah? It's me, Peel. WILL: H-hold... Hold on. I gotta... I gotta take this. Um... Peel, how did you...? How did you get my number? It was on my roommate's computer. WILL: Oh, uh... Well... It's good to hear your voice, Peel, but it's kind of early. I got so excited. I couldn't wait. WILL: Uh... Uh... - Yeah, um... - Mom is dead. WILL: What? Mom died? When? Last month. WILL: Shit. Do you still live with Dad? WILL: Um... No. Um... Dad died a while back, Peel. Dad's dead? WILL: Yeah, Dad... Dad's dead. You didn't know? Mom never told you? No, she never said anything. What about Sam? Is Sam still alive? WILL: As far as I know, but I haven't talked to him in a while. SARAH: Who is that? WILL: Just hold on. I'll be out in a second. Listen, Peel, I gotta go. It was good talking to you, but hopefully we'll get the chance to talk again. Take care, all right? - [PHONE HITS CRADLE] - [LINE BUZZING] Hello? William? [♪♪♪] [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] Can you give me a ride to the bus station? Sure. Can I help you? I'm here to see William. He's not here. Do you know when he'll be back? Can I ask what this is about? It's okay. I'll just wait. [DOOR OPENS] Uh, Will called. He's on his way home. He wanted me to ask if your name is Peel? Okay. Okay, so are you Peel? Yeah. Good. I'm Will's wife, Sarah. Can I use your bathroom? He's playing with the girls. It's fine. I don't know. He brought a suitcase and a piece of wood. Calm down, Will. It's okay. Strawberry volcano. [GIGGLING] Peel, can I get you something to drink? Do you have any Oran-Zini? Actually, we do. [DOOR OPENS] - MOLLY: Daddy's home. - ASHLEY: Daddy's home. - MOLLY: Hey, Daddy. - ASHLEY: Hey, Daddy. Hey. Hey. What's up, girls? Huh? Um... My loves, how about you go play out back for a little while while Peel catches up with Daddy, okay? Okay. [EXHALES] Peel. Um... Wow, you... You look almost exactly the same. You don't. Yeah, well, uh... [CHUCKLES] Um... So you're here. You showed up. You, um... You gonna build something? I wanna measure you. [SCOFFS] It's Dad's... ...measuring board. Wha...? Really? That's... That's... That's wild. [CHUCKLES] Can I? Eh... No, no. I'm gonna go get ready, change... Honey, come on. [SCOFFS] I'm not gonna... Come on. Let's see how tall you are. [GROANS] All right. Fine. Okay. Interesting. What? You're 6 feet tall. [LAUGHS] No, that's... That can't be right. I was 6'1" in high school. - It's... - You shrunk. WILL: Yeah. Uh, maybe. Um... Well, thank you for measuring me. That was... ...different. Does Sam live around here? No. No. Last time I talked to Sam, he was in Biloxi. When was that? A few years ago. We don't really keep in touch, you know? Things haven't gone so well for Sam. He's had a drug problem, on and off, since high school. Do you have his phone number? I need to ask him something. No. I mean, even I did, he wouldn't wanna talk to you. He doesn't want anything to do with his family. So, what have you been up to... the last 25 years? Well... the day after you left, I felt really bad. So I went into my room and cried. And then the day after that... I don't really remember. I mean, you don't have to give me a whole day-to-day account. I just... I just meant, how have you been lately? Oh. Good, I guess. [DOOR OPENS] - You boys doing okay? - Yeah. We're good. Okay. The girls are asleep. They wanted me to tell you, "Good night, Uncle Peel." Good night. Got some pillows and blankets out for you. Glad you're here. Sleep well. Why did Dad leave? I don't know, Peel. I mean, I wish things were different. I really do. Why didn't he take me with him? I... It wasn't like that. Listen, I, uh... I'm glad you came to visit, I am, but it's late. You know? And I got a big day tomorrow. Okay. I just don't understand. [SIGHS] Dad did not leave because of you. Dad left because he thought Mom was a nutcase. I mean, they had problems, Peel. They... They couldn't get along. And Dad, you know, he was just... He was just... He just wasn't available, and he just shut down. And Mom, she felt completely alone... ...and she poured everything into us. And it was... It was excessive. He didn't like the way she was raising us. With the homeschooling and the breastfeeding. I mean, I don't even wanna know how long she breastfed you. Until I was 10. Uh... No. Don't... Don't ever tell anybody that. Ever. Hell, you think you had it hard living with Mom? I mean, you probably had it a lot easier than me and Sam. Dad just... He hated himself and he took it out on us. Especially Sam. Why didn't he ever come see me? [SIGHS] He wanted to. He never called me or anything. Here, um... Just hold on a second, okay? I'll be right back. [SIGHS] [SIGHS] Over the years, Dad wrote you letters. He, uh... He felt so guilty, you know, about leaving. But he could just never get the courage up to mail them, so they just... They just piled up in the box. Um... I think he hoped that someday when you're a little older, you know, he could give them to you in person. [CLEARS THROAT] I know he'd want you to have them. All right. Um, I'm gonna get some sleep. Come home. [SIGHS] Peel... [SIGHS] Listen, I am... I'm really... I'm glad you came to visit. I am. But, you know, I got a lot going on right now, a lot of, uh, stuff at work. Just a lot. Um... I can't really handle... a lot right now, so, um... Yeah, I think it'd be best if you, you know, just head home in the morning. Okay. Do you think maybe we could get pancakes in the morning? Yeah. I mean, it's a little crazy around here with the girls, getting them ready for school and everything... but I mean, we could definitely try. Okay. [WHISPERING] I can't believe you're kicking him out. [WHISPERING] I'm not kicking him out. He's your little brother. I'm aware of that. I'm not kicking him out, Sarah. I mean, I have a lot going on right now. I can't handle this. "A lot going on"? You always have a lot going on. He is your brother, Will. Your flesh and blood. [SCOFFS] I haven't seen him in 25 years. You think it's easy to pick up where we left off? Like everything's okay and wonderful? You have no idea what this has been like. I have no idea because you never even fucking told me he existed. [NORMALLY] He's gonna hear you. SARAH: He overhears me? I hope he hears me. WILL: Sarah, you're gonna wake the kids. SARAH: Fine. Maybe you can explain to them why their daddy sent their new uncle home. WILL: Don't make me be the bad guy. I'm not the one who showed up on someone's doorstep out of the blue. I mean, it's a lot to process. It's a big thing. It's a big adjustment. SARAH: Well, maybe while you're adjusting, you can process why the hell you are so goddamn closed off. Just like your dad. [♪♪♪] [SCOFFS] I'm nothing like him. Hey there, world traveler. Where's Chad? Couldn't make it. Cheerleader practice. How was Georgia? It's like Alabama, but Georgia. What's with the board? You're not still mad at me, are you?

My brother told me that a trifecta is a horse's bet. Oh, yeah? Well, amigo, trifecta is a triple-yield transaction. I don't care if you go to the racetrack. Just pay me the rent. You still owe me money, and Chuck's only paid me 1 cent. [IN SPANISH] Hey, don't worry about it, Peel. Good for it, man. Chuck here is known as Mr. Keynote.

[CLICKS TONGUE] I have to find my brother. Man, you could find your brother tomorrow. Huh? When in Biloxi, let you hair down. My hair is down. I have to find him. Okay. Well, I guess, it's me and Chuck, then. Chuck-o, you ready? [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [TOILET FLUSHING] [IN ENGLISH] Help your brother's boat across and your own shall reach the shore. Good luck. Hey, who you looking for? Sam Munter. Oh, yeah, he don't live there anymore. He moved. Where? I'm not sure, man. If you see him, would you tell him his brother Peel dropped by? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Fuck. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] PEEL: Sam? I know you're in there. - Fuck. - Are you gonna let me in? What are you doing here, Peel? Will send you? No. Can I come in? Hell, no. Why? Uh... I didn't invite you here. And I don't wanna see you. I don't believe you. Well, you know, believe it, and go back to wherever the hell you came from. Mom's dead. Good. Can we talk? I don't wanna talk. Do you need money? What...? You wanna give me money? Huh? Slide it under the front door. I'll give it to you if you let me in. How much are we talking about? I can give you $200. Okay. All right, you get two minutes. I'll let you in, you give me the money, then you gotta go. What the fuck is that? I wanted to measure you to see how tall you are now. Are you retarded? You hauled that thing all the way here just to measure me? Yeah. Jesus. All right, well... So you found me. Go ahead. Say what you came here to say, and give me your pity money and feel good about yourself. Do you live here alone? Yeah. It's messy. [SCOFFS] Yeah, well, my house cleaner, she has the week off. Really? What, small talk? Come on, man. You tracked me down for that? See, here I was worried you were gonna throw some emotional bullshit at me, but, hey, small talk it is. How about them Crimson Tide? [CHUCKLES] [COUGHS] Aren't you glad you found me? I am glad I found you. Why? We don't even know each other. Hell, I've got more in common with my pimp neighbor than I do with you. So why are you here? Are you on some kind of nostalgia trip? I'm pretty sure you were wearing that same shirt last time I saw you. No. I was wearing pajamas. Jesus Christ. Why are you here? I wanted to see how you're doing. Yeah, well, I'm... I'm just fine. I'm dandy, I'm... Now you know. All right, you happy? I'm happy you're still alive. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, well, that makes one of us. Now, why don't you give me that money and get out of here? I don't know how much drugs you can buy with that, but I hope it's enough that you feel better every day. All right. It's been a blast. - Do you remember that one time...? - Okay. All right. Here we go. No, go ahead. Let's hear it. Let's hear your sappy, brotherly bonding story. Okay. Do you remember that one time when you took the water hose and you taped it to the bicycle pump, and you sat at the bottom of the pool, and I pumped air to you so you could breathe? No. No. What I remember was you peeing in the hose and me nearly drowning to death, choking at the bottom of the pool on your piss. That's what I remember. I didn't pee in the hose. It was William. Yeah? So? That was a long time ago, Peel. You got mad at me. And you took my G.I. Joe and you buried it in the yard. Yeah? You never told me where you buried it. I've dug up every inch of the yard, trying to find it. I was hoping you could tell me where you buried it. Jesus. [CLEARS THROAT] You're still the same, Peel. I mean, you tracked me down to ask me where I buried your G.I. Joe? Twenty-something years ago? Go home, Peel. I didn't invite you here. And I don't want you here. What? Are you...? Are you deaf? Get out of my house. Take your pity money and get out of here. What, are you fucking stupid? I said, get out! I'm not mad at you, Sam. I forgive you. For what? You forgive me for what? I didn't do nothing to you. I just wanna know where you put my G.I. Joe. This isn't about your stupid doll. Okay? Please, just get out. Jesus. [SNIFFLES] Please, get out. I can't... I can't do this. [SNIFFLES] Why'd you come here? What, you wanted to see what a piece of shit your older brother became? I am nothing. I am like a fucking bug. I am like a fucking cockroach that won't die. I don't want this. You understand that? I don't want it. Fuck. [SOBBING] Get out. You wanna know how tall I am? [GRUNTS] What are you sitting there for? Leave with your stupid piece of wood. Wanna know how tall I am? I'm 5-fucking-10, now get the fuck out! Don't come back. Ever. You hear me? [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [GASPS] [CHUCKLES] Peel. You know the motel has a pool, right? Hmm? Where's Chuck? Slot machines. Hey, you find your brother? All right, well, there's always tomorrow. I'm gonna hit the rack. Don't drown. Maybe we should've left a note for Chuck at the motel in case he comes back. He ain't coming back. Why not? He's on a bender. Binge. Drink-about. Maybe we should go look for him after this. Chuck's his own man, Peel. He's got his own destiny, which we can't interfere. If he wanted be here, he'd be here. Sure you wanna do this? Hmm? I'll be here if you need me. This ain't good. This ain't good. [FAUCET RUNNING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] PEEL: Sam? [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Let me in, Sam. [SIGHS] You okay? Huh? Let's go. [ENGINE STARTS] [BANGING] [ROY WHISTLING] [SNIFFLES] [EXHALES] How you feeling? Hmm? Like shit. [CHUCKLES] Chasing the old dragon, huh? Hmm? Got a monkey on your back? Living on Chinese rocks, shooting smack, huh? I'm just your run-of-the-mill junkie. That's it. What's your story? Well, I'm just a run-of-the-mill degenerate gambler. [CHUCKLES] Well, here's to being a fuck-up. Only one in the car who isn't is your brother. Most decent person I've ever met. Yeah, he's something. I don't know what that is, but... yeah, he's something.

Thanks. How about a glass of milk? No. If you're hungry, I could make NoodleO's. Look, that'll just make me puke, man, okay? - Maybe you should go swimming. - Jesus, Peel. I feel like shit, okay? Can you just... Just leave me be? For a moment? [EXHALES] [DOORBELL RINGS] [♪♪♪] ROY: How's it going? Could I help you? You wouldn't be William Munter, would you? No, why? I'm Floyd Evans. I was the Munter's pool man back in the day. - No shit? - Yeah. - We already have a pool guy. - Ah. That's... That's not why I'm here. I... I heard about Lucille Munter's passing. I just come by to pay my respects. - She was a beautiful woman. - Mm. You wouldn't happen to know how I might get in touch with Peel Munter, would you? No, why do you ask? Just thought I'd come by and see how he's doing. It's gotta be rough on someone his circumstance, losing their mother, being all alone in the world... I'm sure Lucille left him a pretty penny. That can be a burden in and of itself. I thought I might offer some guidance in the matter. Mm. Guidance, huh? Peel moved out. Didn't leave an address. [CLICKS TONGUE] That is a shame. It's important that I talk to him. I need to tell him something. If you did see him, would you...? Would you mind having him give me a call? Sure. All right. Thanks, friend. CHUN JA: Maybe you can pay for the pizza. Anyway, happy birthday. [CHAD CHUCKLES] This was the picture my dad kept by his bedside right until the day he died. Let me see. [♪♪♪] That's you? [CHUCKLES] Little Peel. Look at that. Yeah. CHUN JA: Let me see. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, fuck. PEEL: Dear Dad... thanks for all your cards and letters. They made me so happy. [♪♪♪] I've been thinking about you too. Things are going good here. I got a job. I teach art and swimming on weekends. One boy can hold his breath for a really long time. I'm training him to beat my friend Chad's record. I have a girlfriend now. Her name is Chun Ja and I think you'd like her. She's really pretty, and we have a lot of fun together. She's teaching me a lot of new things. My roommate Roy got a job at the racetrack. They must not pay him much because he never has any money. But his rent is always on time. [LAUGHS] And I heard from my old roommate Chuck. Looks like he's back from his drink-about. He says he found his true purpose and is the head of a Mexican dance troupe in Pascagoula, Mississippi. William and his girls came to visit. Sarah made him take some time off work, so that he could do some adjusting and processing with me and Sam. I'm not sure what that means, but we're having a lot of fun. Mom would love the girls. They're free spirits, just like she was. [SAM EXHALES] [CLEARS THROAT] [GRUNTS] PEEL: Sam lives with me now. He hasn't been feeling too well lately, but he says I'm good medicine for him. As for you and Mom, even though you guys didn't work out, I know she loved you. At least the young you. She used to say she loved the man she married, but not the man she lived with. She always said it with a smile, but I knew it made her sad. If you go see her up there, tell her she did a good job raising me and let her know that I'm okay. Anyway, Dad, I should probably go. I just thought you'd be happy to know that after all this time, the Munter brothers are finally together again. Oh, yeah, and remember the G.I. Joe you gave me for my fifth birthday? We found him. He was hiding for 25 years. And now he's safely back with the family, where he belongs. [♪♪♪] Subtitles by explosiveskull [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
