I'm gonna kiss you all over, baby. I'm gonna take you there. [music playing] CONNIE: Miami-- what can I tell you about Miami? Well, this is what's really happening these days. The good news, big money keeps flowing in. The bad news? Too many sharks smelling an easy killing. So I say, be smarter than the other guy. Do your homework. Know your mark. I mean, really know your mark. For instance, I read in the business section this morning that someone called Goldman just quit some big ad agency. So I do a little checking here, a little checking there, and I'm ready to do business. Connie Coolidge to see Mr. Goldman. I have an appointment. Well, please take a seat and I'll have someone see you. MAN: I don't know to tell you. Goldman was let go Friday afternoon. Took me out to camp with him. I think he's going independent. MARSHA: This is a shock. I even gave notice at my other job. You see, I flew in from Chicago. Well, I have his home number if you'd like to make a call. Well, I do have a slight problem. Mr. Goldman promised he would cover any of my expenses, and I had to lay out $600 for my plane ticket. MARSHA (VOICEOVER): Short and sweet. Never say more than you have to. Never stay longer than you need. 600? Why did I say Chicago? I should have said LA and asked for 800. Anyway, it's not a bad day's work, and it's not even lunchtime. SALESPERSON: Ma'am, it's our policy. I'm sorry, but I really can't do that. WOMAN: Just charge it to my room like I told you. You're just too lazy to do the paperwork. 235, do you have that? And tell your boss to call me when he comes back. Gift wrapped. 235. MARSHA: I'll have the lobster thermidor and a glass of champagne. French, if you have it. WAITER: Thank you, ma'am. Are you staying at the hotel? Yes, room 235. You can charge it. Oh, and have a bottle of champagne sent to the sales girl at the boutique. I think she'd like Dom Perignon-- with a note. Apologies for my behavior, room 235. You can charge that too. WAITER: Very good. [horn honking] [telephone ringing] Hello? HENRY (ON PHONE): Marsha, it's your friend, Henry. What do you want, old friend Henry? How'd you like to make another payment on your brother's debt? MARSHA (ON PHONE): How much, Henry? 500 for five minutes. Sounds like a pretty good rate. Who do I have to shoot? Oh Marsha, Marsha. You know me. I mean, your brother Frankie'd still be in the slammer if it wasn't for my expertise as his counsel. Yeah, I know, my brother won't even speak to me, and I'm still paying for your expertise. Well, it's time for you to make another payment, sweetie. OK. All right. What's the poop? The poop? Well, the poop is put on something sexy and go to the car wash on third tomorrow morning at 10. There's a fancy red sports car that comes in every Tuesday for the VIP treatment, only this time, it's going bye bye to South America-- that is, as soon as you can engage the owner in a distracting conversation. [funky music] [woman vocalizing] Nice car. Is it yours? Yeah. It's gorgeous. Thanks. Uh, do you have any change? There's a machine in there. It sells those little tree air fresheners, but it only takes dollar bills. I don't. I don't have any change. I'll get some coffee. They'll break it for me. Do you want some? Yeah. Two regular coffees, please. No, I'll have a cappuccino. Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. I'm Cassandra. Matt. So, Matt, you can't be from around here. Actually, I grew up in South Beach. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Graduated from the University of Miami. What do you do? I get my car washed. I do a little bicycling, a little, uh, windsurfing. Sounds like a good job to me. Where do I apply? I love windsurfing. WOMAN (ON PA): Attention, please. The owner of the white Mercedes 500, your car is ready for pickup. Matt Conrad? Matt Conrad? You're not the "Headless Johnson's Revenge" Matt Conrad, are you? Yeah. My eight-year-old loves those games. Thanks. Tell him he's gotta file a claim with his insurance company. They're not gonna do squat unless he reports it. Hey, why don't you file a report with your insurance company? Lady, you got some nerve. I'm not the one that was preoccupied with my hormones and left my car unattended. Hey, there's no need to be rude. Step over this way, please, sir. Sir, I'd like to check the documentation on some of your workers. I'm impressed. The Matt Conrad. What, it takes a Lamborghini to impress you? No, what impresses me is a guy who's able to start up a multimillion dollar business out of his garage. I was just doing what I love. Somebody wanted it. I got lucky. Makes two of us. You have beautiful eyes, you know that? You say that to everyone. No, I-- I don't. Well, this is it. Would you like to come in for a drink? I'd love to. Wow. My entire apartment could fit in your living room. Yeah, well. So all this is yours? Not quite. Company owns it. And you own the company? No, they just kind of need me right now, so they figured this'd keep me happy. And are you? Sometimes. The shareholders say that if I'm happy, they're happy. So. How about you? Are you happy? Uh, sometimes. Pool, my favorite game. Do you wanna play a game? Yeah, I'd love to. I'm not very good, though. Oh, come on, rack the balls. I'll show you how to play. [inaudible] You gonna break? I'm going to break. Now, pay attention. Two balls. Very impressive. Excuse me. It's quite all right. I don't mind at all. All right, you're breaking my concentration. Yeah, yeah. The excuses are starting already. MATT: All right, go ahead. You're breaking my concentration. Oh, isn't that awful? It's my shot. That's all you get. [moaning] Well, Smokey, gotta go to work now. I had a good time. I just want you to know I don't make a habit of this kind of behavior. So I guess you say goodbye to number 52 and put another notch in the old bedpost. Well, actually, um, the bed's antique, So I keep track of my conquests on my computer. I'd like to read it sometime. Mm-hm. Sorry, I'm just afraid that-- That what? That I go out with women once and then I throw them away? Well? I like you. Does that mean I'll see you again? Maybe. Give me your phone number. Top one's a cellular. Bottom one's home. Hm. You know, you even look good in my sweats. You're gonna have to see me again if you want 'em back. I'm gonna want them back. Bye. See ya. What do you say, slim? Nice outfit. What do you want, Henry? How's your brother Frankie? Last time I saw him was when I put him on the bus. He hasn't called, and I can't find him. I dunno. I think maybe his pride's getting in the way. Call it "guilt." And your brother isn't showing much gratitude, letting baby sister pay his bill. He's my brother. He helped me out when I was a kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, how'd you like to pay Frankie's debt in one shot. Who do I have to kill? Don't say that. It hurts my ear. No, no. You've got other talents. You're an artist. We got this girl who works temp. And right now she's working at Steven Hayes, transferring files onto hard discs, floppy discs, and putting it all on one computer. Anyhow, she's coming up with some pretty hot stuff. Well, we got this one old broad, she's about ready to drop at any minute. She's, uh, been living off of the interest and the dividends of a trust fund that her brother set up for her before he died. Anyhow, once she keels over, the entire bundle goes to this girl, Jean. She doesn't know who Jean is. She doesn't wanna know. But Jean is the illegitimate daughter of her dead brother, and is destined to become the, uh, sole surviving blood relative of the dynasty. Capish? Yeah. Go on. Well, Jean never knew her father. She doesn't even know she's coming into all this scratch. She's just out there. You're gonna become her new best friend, and you're gonna get to know every intimate detail about her. And when the old lady dies, boom. Out goes the old Jean, in comes the new Jean. And the new Jean suddenly finds out that she's very, very rich. Boom, Henry? You know I don't do boom. - Oh, come on. You know, this is gonna be nice and clean. We're gonna take good care of her. We're gonna send her on a nice, long trip to Fiji. By the time she comes back, the biscuits are done. I mean, even if she finds out, it's gonna be too late. I dunno. You have it-- Come on, Marsha. I'm giving you the chance of a lifetime. All I'm asking you is to inherit a few million. 20%, and your brother's debt is off the books once and for all. OK, nothing happens to the girl. My brother's debt is history. I get 30%. Oh, Marsha. Come on, don't do this to me. OK, OK, OK. Here I got some scratch, 3,000. Expenses, get yourself a used car. Pay cash. Come on. I want a receipt. This isn't like you, actually putting out money for a job. Well, you gotta speculate to accumulate. I got you an apartment right across the hallway from hers. Hello, Jean Ivers. [knocking] JEAN: Yeah. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. I just moved into apartment 15, and I was wondering if you had some decaf I could borrow. Uh, sure. Wait there. Thanks. Ah, thanks. You're a lifesaver. I'm Maddie. Oh, Jean. Welcome to Sunnyside. It seems like a fun place. Hey, well, thanks for the coffee. I'll get you some more in the morning. - No rush. - Thanks. Bye-bye. [phone ringing] Hello. MARSHA (ON PHONE): Hey, Stein. Can I see you? Not, "hello Mr. Stein. How are you?" All right, Mr. Stein, how the hell are you? Not bad for an old guy. Uh, 10:00, our usual place? STEIN (ON PHONE): Suits me. Are you all right? Mm-hm. Yeah, I just need to talk to you. I'll be there. Bye. [beep] [music playing] (SINGING) All alone, I see you standing there with nothing left to show me but your tears. Sorry I'm late. I was beginning to think you had a better offer. I had an offer, but it wasn't better. Cheers. Something's bothering you. I'm OK. Is it that bad? Let me ask you a question. If somebody offered you a big break, something that could set your life free, but it involved something that was against your principles, would you do it? Would you? I dunno. Marsha, you have your whole life ahead of you. And it'll be a good life, if you let it. I've been thinking a lot about the past lately, lamenting my regrets, reveling in my accomplishments. I thought about the time we met in the art gallery, and you came up to me as if you'd known me forever. You were the most magnificent woman I'd ever seen. And then you sold me the Matthies. It was a good buy. I'd have bought out the whole gallery if you asked me to. I still have the Matthies. I know. It's worth double. I'll never sell it. You've never asked me for anything, Marsha. And whatever I've given you, I've gotten back many times over. You're the closest I've ever had to a family. But if something's wrong, honey, I wanna be able to help. It's nothing, really. I think I'm just feeling a little bit guilty. Well, I met somebody, and I'm afraid I may have blown it already. So you slept with a guy on the first date. I wouldn't even call it a date. So you're having second thoughts about him, wondering if he thinks you're easy, or perhaps easy to forget? Exactly. If it'll make you feel any better, Marsha, you are not easy to forget. What would I do without you? You'll get by. I promise. [laughter] Hi. Oh, hey. Better late than never. Maddie, remember? Of course. Here you go. You didn't have to do that. I insist. Now maybe you can tell me what there is to do around here for excitement. Well, I just walked into this bar and told 'em I was looking. Asked me if I could tend bars. I said sure. Bingo, I'm a shot girl at the Duke of Earl. What is the Duke of Earl? It's a strip place. Very upscale, though, so they call it "exotic dancing." You know, guys come in, drink, watch the girls. So you're a stripper? No, no. Hardly. No, the-- the shot girls is where the real money is. You just work the floor pouring shots for guys, and they tip you really great. Sounds good to me. What are you doing? Uh, well, I guess I'm back to waitressing. I love your place. Excuse my pigginess. Don't worry about it. You should see my place. Jean, I have a big favor I have to ask you. Shoot. Um, I don't know anybody here, and I'm having some money being wired to me. Uh-huh. And I don't have a bank account yet. So I was wondering if it would be all right if I could have it sent to your account. You know, just for now till I get setup. I'll pay the charges and stuff. Sure, when's it due? Tomorrow, I hope. Here, let me get it. All my account stuff's in here, so just let me know when they send it, and I'll cash it out for you. Great. Thank you so much. You know, you should check out the Duke of Earl if you need a job. You should come by tonight. I'm working. Yeah? Well, maybe I'll come by and take a look. OK. It'd be fun to work together. The place is a trip. Yeah? Can't wait. All right, I'll see you. OK, bye-bye. [music playing] (SINGING) One, two-- one, two, three, four. [cheering] Driving in my car, she slides next to me. She puts her hand up on my leg, shows me where her interests be. Oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh. Can you feel it? Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Can you feel it? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Can you feel it? Dance and dance all night, baby. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Can you feel it? On our way back home, gonna turn the world around. I'll take you into the dark of night, speed south. Rum and coke? Hi. Tabletop. Tabletop. Woo! Tabletop! Ah-hah! Woo! Yeah. Woo! $200 to lose the top. 200 bucks for the top. 200 bucks. $200. Top. The top! 200 bucks. $200 more for the top. [chuckling] Sorry, babe, wasn't worth the extra. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Am I wrong? What? Was I wrong? Was I wrong? Was I wrong? Are you OK? What a jerk. That bastard owes me $200. Don't worry about it, OK? Be right back. Good evening, sir. I believe you owe the lady $250. [chuckling] They've called the police. Now, give me the damn money, and get your fat ass out of here. He gave you an extra 50, for pain and suffering. Well, let me buy you a drink. Two double stoli tonics on the rocks, please, bartender. Ooh, what a night, what a night. Just another day at the office. I'll make some coffee. I know you need some. No, no, no, no. No coffee. You got vodka? Double vodka coming right up. What a jerk. And you, I don't believe you. Yeah, well, seeing is believing. And I still can't believe you took your clothes off in front of all those guys. Yeah, well, I guess when someone is waving the next month's rent under your nose, your inhibitions go out the window. Yeah, I know the feeling. So anyway, on to happier topics. Tell me about your boyfriend. Well, I don't even know if I can call him my boyfriend. We got real close, real quick. And I don't know if I'm afraid of hurting him or he's afraid of hurting me, but I think we need some time apart. Hm, been there. Thing is, he's really cute, incredibly nice. And you wanna talk about money. Ah, so finally the truth comes out! It helps, but it's not the money. I just can't stop thinking about him. Hm. So what about you? Ugh. Well, there is this one guy who comes into the club. Everyone says he watches me the whole night. He never even watches the show, just little old me. He wasn't there tonight, but if he'd just say hello to me-- Ugh. Oh, you saved my life. What did I drink? Not "what," my dear. "How many." Get some sleep. You're gonna feel lousy in the morning. MARSHA: Ugh. WOMAN (ON PHONE): There's a Jean Ivers to see you, Mr. Kronfeld. HENRY (ON PHONE): There's a what? WOMAN (ON PHONE): A Miss Jean Ivers is in the lobby, sir. Well, all right. I'm coming right down. Jean Ivers, sir. What the hell are you doing here, calling yourself Jean Ivers? Would you relax, Henry? It's OK. Just get back there and get on it. You're seen here, I'm dead. We're both dead. Henry, I want out, OK? She's a really nice girl. I don't know what you're planning to do to her, but I don't want any part of it. You don't what what? You don't want what? I set you up with the deal of a lifetime! Oh, no, no, missy. We go back too far together. You owe me money! Now, you follow through on this, or I'm gonna find your brother, and I'm gonna end his debt once and for all. Just tell me you're not gonna hurt her. I already told you, now just do it. You better eat, sleep, and breathe Jean Ivers. Hey, it's not like you to fall for a mark, huh? I mean, what happened to the old Marsha. All right, I'll do it. But after this, we're through. Clean slate. And if anything happens to her, Henry, I'm going to the cops. Hey, nothing's gonna happen. Promise. [dialing] ANSWERING MACHINE: You have reached the office of Mr Stein. Mr. Stein is not available at the moment. If you would like to leave a message, please-- [beep] WOMAN: Perfectly still, Mr. Stein. Perfectly still. The new girl get here yet? Yeah, she's trying on an outfit. Oh, good. But I don't think how it looks on her is gonna be a problem. Who's that? Did you see that? Oh, my gosh. You got it, baby. Great! Hello? It's open! MARSHA: HI. Hey. Oh, your wire came through. You want the cash? Oh, I'm not quite set up yet. you think you could hang on to it for a couple days? Sure. Try not to spend it. Guess what? I got the job. Get outta here. I'm a cocktail waitress. That's great. - Can you do me a favor? - Hm. I left my soda out on the patio table. Can you grab it for me? Yeah. You wicked girl, you. You knew, didn't you? Oops. Good shot. Pour. OK, to, um-- to great wealth. I think I've reached the point where I can safely say that's passed me by. Don't let it. Even if you have to trip it on its way up. If I had your looks, I'd go for it too. It's-- it's not looks. It's attitude. There's this older friend that I have. He's always given me as much as I've given him. Friendship, advice, companionship, no questions asked. He happens to be wealthy, but he's got such style and grace that even if he didn't own a dime, you'd still wanna spend time with him. He's amazing. Sugardaddy? MARSHA: No. No, he's way too classy for that. Have you heard from your boyfriend? He could be a dead issue. He hasn't called. Maybe it's just not meant to be. [dialing] Hey, Jody, it's me. Any calls? JODY (ON PHONE): Yes, Matt Conrad called. He just got back to town, and please call him at 555-0287. You go that? Uh-huh. JODY (ON PHONE): He said he'd like to see you as soon as possible. Thank you, Jody. You are a doll. [music playing] [giggling] You are so beautiful. Come here. You know, I gotta tell you, ever since I met you it's-- I don't know what happened. I was so numb and indifferent. And now-- I dunno. Everything just seemed so black and white before, and now everything's in color. You know, I've been happy. I really like you. I'm crazy about you. I don't wanna lose you. [phone ringing] Hello. HENRY (ON PHONE): Hey, slim. Henry. We're on the fast track now, honey. The old lady's in a coma. Stick around for an envelope in the morning. Oh, my god. It's really gonna happen. HENRY (ON PHONE): You're gonna be rich, kid. Very rich. [music playing] (SINGING) Well, she took me in. She took me out. She cried to me the same old story.

Listen, I don't know how to tell you this, but I got a call from the DA's office, and they're-- they're asking about you. I don't know how much they know. I couldn't get a read, but you better get out of there and lie low for a while. I knew it was too good to be true. Where's Jean? Listen, don't worry about her. Worry about yourself. Go to your manager. Give him some sort of a story. Go down to Key West. I-- I got a place down there. MARSHA (ON PHONE): OK. Call me when when you get close. [music playing] It's OK, boss, It's OK. She's on her way to the Keys. I'm coming back to town. [phone ringing] Hello. Hello? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Miss Thomas? Miss Thomas, we just signed something for you. It's very important. Can you hear me? Miss Tho-- it's very important. Must call Stein's office. Hello? Hello? Miss Thomas? Hello? [buzzing] WOMAN (ON PHONE): Operator. - Hello, operator. I'm wondering if you could help me. WOMAN (ON PHONE): What's the number, please? 555-1209. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Hello? Hello. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Oh, Miss Thomas. Thank you so much for calling back. Something has come up, and did you know that Mr. Stein has been ill? What? I didn't. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Listen, try to get over here. I can't discuss it on the phone. We need to see you as soon as possible. Hey! Can you give me a ride to Miami? Sure, hop in. Henry, this is Miss Jones. She's been doing some document transfers for us. She always helps to track down Miss Thomas. And this is Mr. Stevens. Mr. Stevens is the trust nominee for the estate of Mr. Stein. How do you do? I'll be brief. I'm sure you're both anxious to hear the terms. Uh, Miss Thomas has been advised that she's one of the beneficiaries to Mr. Stein's estate. However, naturally, we're not aware of the specifics. Quite. Miss Thomas? You can call me Marsha. Miss Thomas, shortly before Mr. Stein died, he created a living trust, you as the beneficiary and I am the trustee. At your direction, however, I may remain as trustee, or you may appoint whomsoever you wish as a replacement trustee. Is this clear to you? Perfectly. Good. He also intimated to me that he trusted your judgment implicitly. So I must now ask you if you wish to appoint a replacement trustee. Yes, she does. And here is the appropriate appointment document nominating myself as trustee and the firm of T Markowitz and Kronfeld as legal advisors. Yes. Very efficient. Thank you. May we we know the exact terms? Well, the list is quite long. It's approximately $2 million in cash, about six million in stocks, shares, and other assets. This is a schedule of the assets and their disposition. I will prepare my resignation paper with your appointment as replacement trustee. Those papers have to be filed in court. It may take a few days. Meanwhile, I will follow your directions. Miss Thomas, I'd like to reiterate a conversation that I had with Henry. With your permission, of course. Miss Thomas, Mr. Stein was a very private person. Now, while he had no immediate family, he did have some very close friends and associates who will not benefit to the extent that you will. In short, Mr. Stein was very discreet. We feel that it would be in everyone's best interest if your windfall, as it were, were held with a level of discretion that Mr. Stein would have deemed appropriate. In short, this is a private affair, I mean, private matter, and not for publication. Mr. Hayes speaks perfect English. You don't have to translate. What Mr. Stein and I did or didn't do is nobody's business. I understand, Mr. Hayes, is that it? That's it, Miss Thomas. I'll be in touch, as will Mr. Stevens. I'll see you in the coffee shop. Thank you. Thank you. I've never had a trustee before. Well, you got one now, and we're gonna have a lot of fun. What did you do with Marsha? I mean, you are gonna give her a chunk of change, like you said, right? I got a little problem with that right now, but we'll work it out. Right now,m it's best that you lay low in the house for a couple of days. Well, aren't we going to the Bahamas? You sure are. WOMAN: Miss Thomas, Mr. Stein died rather suddenly a few days ago. I'm really sorry to be the one to tell you this. Can I, uh, get you a glass of water? No. No, thank you. It was all very sudden, and we were all pretty shocked. He was a wonderful man. Yes. Thank you. [music playing] [sobbing] Matt. Thanks for coming. It's OK. It's OK to cry. He was all I had when my brother left. He was always there for me. This is so unfair. Feeling any better? A little bit. I made you some tea. I have some things I have to tell you. And after I've said what I have to say, I hope you'll still wanna be with me. What is it, Cassandra? First of all, my name's not "Cassandra." It's "Marsha." [dialing] HENRY (ON PHONE): Hello. They are both in the house. What do you want me to do? HENRY (ON PHONE): I can talk to you right now, so just sit tight. Give it a half hour. And if there's no movement, go on over to my house and check on the other girl. Um, introduce yourself. Tell her you work for me and you're there just to see if she needs anything. Just make sure she stays put. Check with me later. - OK, boss. Henry, we've begun to liquidate all the stocks and other assets as you've instructed, selling them at current market value. You know, Mr. Stein had sold off most of his securities, so the remainder can be liquidated within, oh, five business days. As for the cash and other assets, they'll be transferred immediately. Yeah, yeah. Here you go. The First Bahamian Bank. Yes, I know it well. I assume you'll take care of the regulatory requirements? As soon as possible. Ah. It shall be done. Henry, I'm awfully sorry to lose this account. I'm assuming that you are not unhappy with us. Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. It's just business. Ah-huh. And Miss Thomas is aware of what you're doing? Actually, it was at her direction. She wants to keep it liquid, and thought it best that we keep it all offshore. She's a very sharp lady. Thank you. [knocking] (SINGING) And I need someone to believe in. Just give me someone to believe in. Just give me-- and I was lying to myself. This is me and no one else, I know. Someone to believe in. Just give me someone to believe in. Jose, what are you doing here? Don't I get a kiss? Huh? Of course you do. How did you find me? I'm working for him. He hired me to keep an eye on you. Isn't that something? Jesus, did you tell him that-- No, do you think I'm crazy? Hang on a minute. What, so all those evenings at the Duke of Earl, what you were working for him, watching me? It's great work if you can get it. Does he know that you're here now? He asked me to come over and introduce myself. This is too bizarre. Did he say anything about us? I mean, about me and him? Mm-mm. I'm strictly field work. You know, surveillance, sometimes persuasion. Whatever he needs done, I do for a price and the fringe benefits. How about a little more enthusiasm, dear, huh?

Oh, whatever it takes. What, like you beat people up? It's generally helping them to remember late payments and stuff. Oh. Well, is there something that you were gonna help me to remember? No, you were only half the job. I had to take out that girl you work with, Marsha somebody. Only, I'm still on the case. You were gonna kill her? Well, I was gonna do what I was told to. I'm gonna be sick. Come on, I thought you knew. Come on, hurry. Get dressed. Henry's gonna be here soon. Where is Marsha now? Where is she? She's playing with Matt Conrad over at his place in the Gables. HENRY: Jean, it's Henry. Oh, my god. Come on, hurry. Jean? JEAN: I'm coming. Come on, get that little money maker over here. You OK? Yeah. Hey, did you meet Jose? Uh-huh. Listen, there's been a change in plan. I've gotta go upstate on business for a couple of days. Uh, we'll go to the Bahamas when I come back, OK? Jose'll take care of you. Where is he? I don't know. I think he-- Jose? Jose? You wanted me, Boss? I was in the little boys' room. HENRY: Yeah, come down here. Yeah, you wanna, uh, grab the luggage, take it outside? You can forget about Marsha for a while. Stick with this one. I got some papers. They're very important papers. Keep them away from her, out of sight, and sealed. Claro? You got it, Boss. It's, uh, in the brown envelope. What's that? Something for Henry. Oh, well, here, I'll take it. No. He wants me to keep it safe. No peeking. Well, what do you say we have a drink? Maybe it'd put us in the mood? Maybe. I'll get the glasses. Ugh. [honking] Open up, please. Please, open up. Oh, god, it's Jean. Let her in. Jean, I'm so glad you're OK. Do you know what's going on? JEAN: Mr. Stein had created a trust for you. And-- and Henry had got his hands on it. MARSHA: Can you believe this guy? JEAN: He was playing you against me and me against you. Oh, remember that-- that guy, Jose from the club? Ugh, did he turn out to be a nightmare. Come on, sit down. - Jean, this is Matt. - Hi. Hi. I've heard a lot about you. Same here. All right, take your time. Tell us from the beginning. OK. Oh, first off, you have to call Mr. Stevens. He's Stein's lawyer. That's his number. And I don't care what happens to me. I'm just so glad you're OK. Nothing's gonna happen to you, but wait till I get my hands on Henry. JEAN: Well, you'd better move fast, 'cause I think he's trying to do something with your money. MATT: Yes, here it is, the Henry Kronfeld financial records. Now we can access his bank accounts. [typing] Hm, looks like your friend Henry is moving everything to a bank in the Bahamas. Let's see what we can do about that. Let's give the system 10, 15 minutes. It pays to do a little hacking. May I get you coffee? He said it won't be long. What? May I get you coffee? No, no, no. That's-- that's OK. WOMAN: If you need a phone to call the States, there's one right over there. Oh, no. I'm sure everything's OK, yeah. [door opens] Mr. Kronfeld, sorry to have kept you. Oh, thank you. May I offer you something to drink? Oh, no, no, no. Let's-- let's just get right down to business. You did receive the wire transfers into my account? Indeed, we received the wires. Well, all right, good. Now, here's what I want you to do. I want you to divide the transfers into three separate accounts, and then wire transfer them to these three different banks in Switzerland right now. I'm afraid we can't do that, Mr. Kronfeld. What? I'm afraid we can't do that. Excuse me. Did you or did you not, uh, receive the transfer. We did. All right, so then what's problem? Mr. Kronfeld, the money was transferred and credited to your account here, but a short time ago, the money was removed from your account here and transferred to a stateside account. What? It appears that of the $8 million that was transferred into your account, only $75 was left in. $75? That's the amount that appears on your account balance. Would you like to leave it in or withdraw it? I am the sole appointed trustee. I mean, I did not grant you the authority to do that. I'm afraid we have no say in the matter, Mr. Kronfeld. I suggest you take it up with your bank in the States. [phone ringing] Yes? WOMAN (ON PHONE): I have a long distance call for Mr. Kronfeld. Put it through. Mr. Kronfeld. Hello. Nice try, you bastard. The $75 is to get your ass back here, and we'll settle our accounts once and for all. Oh, and don't try using your credit cards. We've terminated your accounts. Are you all right, sir? Sir? Can-- can I withdraw the $75 right now? All right, now just relax. See the yellow ball? That's the two ball. Now, just hit it real easy on the side. Marsha, Marsha, Marsha. Now, we-- uh, we gotta work something out. I mean, and-- And nothing, you bastard. Where's my money? It's right where it's supposed to be-- in my trust account. I'm the trustee. You don't touch it unless I say so. So long as you're the trustee. Well, you got the picture. Well, Henry, you've been replaced. I've been replaced, huh? I've been replaced. I've been replaced. Well, I'll tell you what. We'll split it 50/50. It's a win-win situation for both of us. No, no more deals, Henry. Besides, you don't have much to bargain with. Oh, what about your friend? I mean, right now, she's in a lot of trouble. Come on, Henry. Is that the best you can do? If she goes down, you go down. [pool balls clack] I'll tell you what. We'll flip a coin for it, Winner takes everything. No, no. I don't like games of chance. How about a game of skill? Name it. One game of eight ball. We play for it. You-- you don't know what to think, do you? Am I conning? Are you conning me? I mean, I watched you play. I could be thinking, "This is gonna be a piece of cake." Don't listen to him. He's conning you. Shut up! So what's it gonna be, slim? We flip a coin or we play for it? If you win, I sign off as trustee, and your brother's debt is history. And if you win? I'll be generous. We'll split everything 50/50. Henry, why the hell should I trust you? A deal's a deal. Tell you what, you've got the break, and I'll let you keep shooting till you sink the first one. Now, how's that for a deal? it's your money. I didn't introduce you. Henry, this is Matt Conrad. He's the owner of that Ferrari you had sent down to South America. Oh, well, sorry about that. Rack 'em. What the hell was that? You outsmarted yourself, you greedy bastard. Remember the Henry Kronfeld con rules. First, know your mark. Their likes, dislikes, history, and abilities. Excuse me. Take nothing for granted. Everything is significant, down to the last detail. Excuse me. Not knowing something can be fatal. All right. Shit. Well, guess the news. When I was in college, my brother Frankie couldn't always afford my incidentals, so I played pool. Three hours a day, seven days a week. Now, sign the papers and get the hell outta here. Here you go, big man. Henry, I've got your dick in a bangle. Any more shit from you and I'll turn the handle. Give me that. Just sign the papers. Can I read this first? Sign it. So where are you taking me? What's the big secret? Oh, you'll see. I told you, it pays to do a little bit of hacking. Do you live here? Why are you asking? Yeah, why are you asking? Is your dad home? My stepdad is. Why don't you get some lemonade. I'll be right back. OK, let's have one lemonade, please. Thank you. You're welcome. Frankie? Frankie! Oh. I thought I'd never see you again. I didn't wanna cause you any more trouble. You're my family. I was so worried about you. I've been looking and looking for you. I've been cleaning up my life. I've been on the wagon for two years, and I didn't even bet $1 on the Super Bowl this year. Oh, Frankie! I thought I'd never see you again. I guess you two have a lot of, uh, catching up to do. Um, we have a lot of catching up to do. [chuckling] [music playing] (SINGING) I don't care how it's supposed to be, only what you mean to me, how I'd feel if you were gone. You said that we would never cry. You said we'd never say goodbye. But that was long ago. More than yesterday. It was once upon a magic moment. We had suns and silver moons and the sky was filled with wonder. It was the greatest love I've ever known. You said we'd never say goodbye. You said that we would never cry. That was long ago. More than yesterday. It was once upon a magic moment. La, la, la, la. It was once upon a magic moment.
