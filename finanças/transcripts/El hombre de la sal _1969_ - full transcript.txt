Mebos, panches and calimas came from the central region. MARCOS OLAYA, "THE MAN OF SALT" With the gold from their rivers Their ideas, and their fruits. To get their big white loaves, that cured diseases. This was the force of the earth, which sprouted as flesh and cotton They cooked it in earthen vessels which only served once. The salt turned out compacted, and their work was tougher. The salt turned out compacted, and their work was tougher... And here comes Don Marcos with his deep love And here comes STONEWARE PIPE FACTORY Don Marcos STONEWARE PIPE FACTORY with his deep love. He processed the salt as they did in the old age. He processed the salt as they did in the old age... According to my watch, it's ten minutes left to buy a watch. As I don't have a watch, I synchronize my watch with the Sesquilé's clock tower, as there's no clock in Sesquilé either. Alright, how much? 50 pesos. How much for this one? Speak, speak. Why don't you speak, if God gave everybody a mouth? ...except for pumpkins.. Go ahead, go ahead, sonny. Because the Sun doesn't stop and neither does the day. Hold it, hold it. Don't make this train gets tired. My pockets are as clean (empty), as... ...the holy Virgin Mary's feet. - Has Don Rosanio come yet? - No, sir. Go ahead, go ahead, sonny. Because the Sun doesn't stop and neither does the day. Be careful with the wire. Do you need something? The salt. Here comes the one with the carriage. - Ok, put it inside. - What's going on? Each time you work with the water, you first check its temperature. 5, 18, 20, 22. And 25. Above that, the salt won't get saturated. When you put this in the water, it will go from 1 to 25°C (33.8°F to 77°F) You take it out with a pump. Right next to the moyas (clay pots). Then you pump it. Here we are using up coal. We use up coal and time here. You fill the moya with a remilón (small bucket). That is, adding a bucket to the moya, very slowly, until it gets filled and the salt gets compact. Once it is compact you turn off the oven and you break it with bars and (uninteligible) In case we have deliveries, we turn the oven off today, we smell it and in two days time take it from the oven. When there are no deliveries, we can keep it in the oven for one or two months. It's been two weeks without... any deliveries, as we didn't know if we could get some orders or not. When you work with the cauldron use a shovel to take out the salt. You put it in the baskets and the drawers until it drains completely. Then you pack it and deliver it. The cauldron. Now it is time for compacting. Put more salt in it! You have to add more. Look, it's not deep enough. - Did you get the water temperature? - Now it is 18°C (64.4°F) Please, release the moyas. - Hurry up, 'cause I have things to do. - Look, this is the order. I'm roasting lunch. How did things go there? I went into the village. 40 full bags were left. Will that be enough or not? I think it will be enough. I'll be lucky if I die soon, because... There are many crooks out there. Hey, it looks like it has a piece of meat in it, a roast, potatoes... some tasty ones. Is it chilly around here? Hey, pass me a piece of cow udder, to put it in the moya. I'd like to eat a roast. but I want to be filmed drinking chicha instead of beer. Would the resguardo (police) be around here? They do sell chicha. Yes, they do. - But, is the resguardo around here? - No, they don't come around here. Chicha: Beverage of indigenous origin based on fermented corn, banned in Colombia in the 19th century and part of the 20th. Bring another bar. That bar is somewhere around here. Is there another one? Don't push it. Don't push it! Don't push it. Don't push it. Don't push it... - Bring it over. - The long stick touches the other one. Put this stick inside here. - Release that long bar. - Now it's time. You break the other one piece by piece. But this must be thrown from on high. - Yes, right after it goes out. - Alright. Now we are going to pack that one. What will happen? Oh, what will happen? From here to Nemocón (a neighbor town) there goes a titanium monster. Oh, what will happen? Oh, what will happen? From here to Nemocón, there goes a titanium monster. (Presumably the train that still covers that route) How in these modern times? How can they ban this people's craft? That means banning their existence. How can they ban this people's craft? That means banning their existence. The pots are broken now. (unintelligible) And in the jute sacks, there is the compacted salt. And in the jute sacks there is the forgotten salt. What will it be? What will it be? What will happen to the man of salt? What will it be? What will it be? What will happen to the man of salt? What a deep loneliness... what a deep loneliness.... what a deep loneliness.... what a deep loneliness....
