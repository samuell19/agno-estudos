Twelve... Eleven... Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Coming! Got you! You cheated! You only win if you catch me! Stop! Got you! -I won! -But only... Shush! I won. -But only... -No, be quiet! ...because I didn't try! That's why you won! I could catch you any time, if I want to... No, stop it... You go in the back. Bruno, I don't want to... And I don't wanna pay another fine for a broken seat belt. Go in the back. Come on now. We gotta go! Not this way... It all looks alike. Let's hurry up. I think it's that way... Cleanliness is our hotel's top priority. That's why our guests come here. We also require a decent demeanor and polite manners towards our guests. Please ask your questions later, okay? If there are any left, I'll be right here. Yes, thank you. Have you ever worked in housekeeping? Housekeeping? Facility management! Ah, ok. I worked in a few different hotels, but it's my first time here. And what the hell is going on with these cats? Go! Hey! Get out! I guess they're hungry. They are sweet, aren't they? I'm allergic. Bruno? I have talked to the manager and he agreed to let us work together. -Really? -Yes, just wanted to let you know. Where am I supposed to go? Room 9, I think. -You "think"? -Yes. Nine or seven. Ok. Ah, okay, well... ...see you soon. -That's cool, isn't it? -You haven't asked him, have you? -What? -Just stop it. Do you wanna get us fired right away? I thought you'd like it. You'll get the rest of the money later this week. I tried to withdraw it, but the ATM is broken. Now, listen to me! Many of our employees would be grateful, if they could live in the resort. Don't you think? No more commutes every day. I know. -You know how high rents are out there. -Yes, I know! As soon as the ATM is fixed, I'll pay the rest of it. I promise! If you struggle financially... come to this address tomorrow at noon. Toni? What are you doing here? Happy birthday to the most beautiful son all over the world! -You thought I forgot, right? -Yes, I did. Blow them out! I wish you all the best and that you become the happiest son in the entire world... ...and that all your dreams come true... ... and that nothing ever changes, and all luck in the universe on top of it! I am already. Wait! This is homemade by me! -You made this? -Yes, for hours... Really! Well then tell me, how did you make it? With eggs... And flour. I want one more piece. -Come here! -Bruno... Seriously! No! Stop it! Don't push it! To us! And totally legal! My Bruno! He is a grown up man now! Wow, a shooting star! What? It's not even dark enough... -Make a wish! -A wish? I don't know. What should I wish for? Maybe... Going somewhere else? Off this island? I mean really far away. Really, really far away! I think we have a nice life. Me too... Fuck, we need to get up! Toni! We need to get up! Go ahead! Toni! Toni! Do you live here all alone? With my son. He works at the hotel, too. What do you mean, he works there, too? How old is he? 21. -Wow, really? -Yes, why? Well, I was 15 when I got him... Wild times... How long will you stay? I don't know yet. I might take some days off. Why would you? -For you! -For me? Bruno! Bruno, come here and say hello. Don't be rude! This is Hannah! Hello! I could show you around the island sometime. Yeah, I'd like that. I think I'll stay one or two more weeks. If that's ok? It's pretty nice down here. I met someone. Hello? So you decided to show up after all. I thought I was supposed to work at the hotel. Is this the right address? Yes. I have some rennovations going on. The workers have less jobs this time of the season. So it's cheaper. I can do all of this, too. In case you need someone... The furniture outside has to be carried upstairs. Let me know when you're done. My goodness... What a crybaby! Hey, you could carry two at once, Bruno, right? Oh come on, Bruno! Don't fall asleep! Attack! Oops, I think it's broken. What? Relax! Relax... What? There are still 20 to go. What is going on with you? We always took our time. Especially you. It was always like... let's slow down, take a break, have a smoke... And now suddenly you are in a rush? Why? Well, she is cooking today. Fish, I think... Seriously? -What? -There are still 20 left to carry, Bruno! Yes... We can handle them within the next 20-30 minutes. One per minute. No problem. You are such an asshole! Me? Why am I an asshole now? Usually you are the slow one. Whenever I have a date, you always dawdle. Have I ever complained? Have you turned into a busy bee now? I'm done, you can do the rest yourself! I'm leaving! Seriously? Who's there? What are you doing? Do you speak German? -Do you live here? -Yes. Seriously? Give it back! I really need it! Why are you doing this? Where are your parents? Oh, no, come on! You can't do this! Really? Wait, please! No, no, no! Wait, I need it! Wait a second! Can you give me the pliers back? You'll get the keys, okay? Let's swap! First the pliers, okay? -Have you ever started a car? -No. Okay, it's easy, I'll show you. When I tell you, you will just turn the key like this... ok? I'm preparing the fish. Do you like fish? By the way, where are you staying? I don't know yet. In some hotel somewhere... -Well, they are still closed, right? But you have a car, so... Bruno! Boygroup move... Stop it! -Knock, knock... You have to ask who's there? -Just leave me alone! -It's your mommy! -Just leave me alone! -Come on, let's dance! -Go back to her and leave me alone. -But I want to dance with you, too! Didn't notice. Don't be grumpy! Stop, stop, stop! -I told you to stop! -Look how I blink with my eyes! -Can you resist these eyes? -No, now stop it! Oh, come on! One dance only! How long is your "friend" staying? My "friend" has a name. I don't know. A few days, probably. Are you a lesbian now? Oh, Bruno. It will always just be the two of us. Go to bed now. I'm done. -Everything is upstairs and unwrapped. -Great! So I will give you your... Do you maybe have time on Thursday as well? -Sure! -There is going to be another delivery. The chairs just have to be brought inside. I don't want to leave them outside. So, I will give you the money for Thursday today, but I will keep this for your rent. ...so you can get in. Please take the trash with you. Okay! I won playing Bingo! Down there with the old people? Mr. Völker needed some help around his house and I thought we could use the money. I could take you out for dinner. You can choose where we go... My cooking isn't that bad, is it? Yes, but I thought it'd be nice to have something different than Pasta or Pizza. -You prefer lamb and lobster? -If you like. You want to take me out? Ask me where I want to go! -Where do you want to go? -To a... pizza place! You're stupid! Bruno... Really, you don't need to do this. I like to do it. Really, I like taking care of you. Okay, but I'm not free tonight. You, can't be serious... Listen to me! I have been working all day! All fucking day! I am really tired, ok?! So, why don't you just fuck off, or I will really freak out! Well, and then what? Will you punch me? -I will freak you out! -Do you think that's normal? Normal? The only one who's not normal is you! Get out! You are crazy! I'm doing everything around here. I am working overtime. I am the one paying rent! Not Toni, not you! This is my apartment! -Hannah, wait... -No, that's between the two of you! What was that?! Huh?! So, this is my fault now? This is my spot, I am always sleeping here. Hannah is sleeping here one night and after that it's your spot again, Bruno! What if she doesn't leave? So, am I supposed to sleep on the couch every night? Is that your plan? I sleep on the couch and you next to him? He has no one but me. What do you mean, he has no one but you? Toni, he is an adult. Come in! -Sorry, I didn't tidy up. -It's all tidy. You should take a look at our place... Do you want a blanket? Yes, if you have one? Thank you! -Will this be okay? -Absolutely! Thanks for letting me stay. You're welcome! Do you need anything else? I need to sleep. I have to get up early tomorrow. No worries! Sleep well! Can you get the parasol? What's going on here? I took the day off. So I'm supposed to do the shift by myself now? You should have talked to me about it. Well, you weren't here. Everything's alright? -Can you handle the workload? -It's manageable. -Great! -Yes, exactly like this. Your mother isn't working today? She took the day off, didn't she? Took the day off? Not that I'm aware of. I thought she told you... She's sick. She isn't feeling well. ...a little under the weather. Okay, please remind her to bring in a medical certificate when she feels better. Send her my well wishes. -Let me know when you are finished. -I will. Zoe? There you are! -Hello! -This is your home? -Yes. Sometime this makes little farts... ...when you put your finger in here. It feels like it's wet... but it's actually not. Cool. I'll show you what I can do. Watch out. I did this a thousand times. Not bad! This is my secret hiding place. Sometimes. Sometimes I am up here and play secretly at night. There it is! There! You can do it like this... Try it! My mom showed me something ... Ah, no this one isn't working as well! A lot of them are broken... I took a paper once and marked all the ones that were broken... Bruno? Hey, get up! Come, get up! It's alright. Wait, I'll help you! Oh, man... Where are the pills? The migraine pills... -Are you not feeling so well? -No, not at all... my stomach... So, you won't be able to work again, huh? Will you tell it Mr. Völker yourself this time? Or do I have to come up with another excuse again? I did tell him last time. Don't lie to me. He wasn't there. I thought you took the day off, Toni? I couldn't find him and then... Yes... So, you're having another day off today? Am I supposed to tell him now? I am also feeling like shit! Thanks for asking. Sure, go back to bed! What? Calm down! Your mother is not feeling well. Has anyone ever asked me how I am feeling?! How do you feel? Like shit. Thanks for asking. But I shouldn't talk that loud, because of your headache, right? As always when things are getting a bit more stressful. But yesterday you had a nice day at the beach, hm? Playing some tennis. But it's the truth... She always does that. Well, if it's just about cleaning. I could come with you. Let me do the talking, okay? My mother is not feeling well... ...and you mentioned before that you need more staff so I brought her to step in... -Hello. Hannah. -Völker, nice to meet you. ...for my mother. Should we call a doctor for her? No, no she'll be fine. She feels a bit dizzy. -It's probably just the weather. -Okay good. Hannah, do you have your passport with you? In the past employes had stolen stuff from the rooms. That's nothing personal. For how long would you like to work here? Only as long my mother is sick! Yeah right, we'll do that anyway. How long could I come here to work? Well, at least two weeks would be very helpful. Well, then two weeks it is. We have to move the bed to the wall, sweep through, make the beds... And this goes on the balkony? -You are just going to watch? -No, I will help you. This goes over here. But straight. Okay, so this stays like this? Well, that is basically it. Look, this goes into the corner. -Which room next, left or right? -Right. -Okay, see you later! -The door is open! -Done! -What? I'm done! You took everything outside and you made the beds? -I'll bring everything to the laundry now. -Ok! Do you know where to find it? Yes, I saw it on the map. Should I take your stuff, too? -Alrighty! -Thank you! Ehm, I'm done now. I'll head out. Where to? I have to get some stuff. Can I join you? What are you looking for? This could work. What are you doing? Hold this. -Do you know this place? -Nope. -Are you taking this? -Yes. Oh shit, somebody is coming! Hurry, hurry! -Give just a little gas. -Yes, wait! -Yes, man! -Nice! It works! -Should I leave it running? -Yes, leave it! -Didn't expect this to work, honestly. -Very good! Toni is not in her room. -She is not home? -No, she's not. -Where else should she be? -I don't know. I'm going to call her. Maybe she just went out. She usually doesn't just take off. Her phone is turned off. What are you going to do? You don't wanna go look for her now, do you? Where are you going? -Bruno! -What? -Bruno, I'm sure she just went to get... -No! She doesn't just take off like that. She always leaves a note. I'm sure she just went to get a beer. I'm sure! You can come down to the beach with me or just go back home, I don't care! Bruno, Toni can take care of herself. She is your mother! You don't have to take care of your mother! Where have you been? -Ah, I'm super tired. Did you doze off? Move a bit. Are you tired from work? Why the attitude? No, I'm just asking. It's still allowed to ask, isn't it? What are looking at, Bruno? Where have you been? At a bar, and you guys? We were working. -And after work? -We fixed the car. -Really? It works again? -Yeah, great, isn't it?! Well, then everything is fine. The car is running again... you have been to work. You have been looking for me, didn't find me, cause here I am! You didn't look in the one bar that I was in, apparently. -You went to a bar? -Yes, because you didn't come back! -Toni, the bars close at 10 pm! -I'm fine, thanks for asking! Thanks for calling! I thought you were asleep! Yes, I was sleeping! I was sleeping and vomiting. I thought you could use the time to relax. You could have checked your phone, sent a message or left a damn note! You know that he went out looking for you? He was at the beach... everywhere. Are you telling me that I'm a bad mom? -I don't know, ask yourself! -What is this, Hannah? Maybe this is none of your business?! Oh, Toni. Come on! Let's talk about this tomorrow! Bruno! I'm so sorry! My Bruno... Bruno! Get up! Work is calling. Get up! Come on! I made coffee. Don't forget to take the cooler! What are you up to, anyway? Do you speak Spanish? Look, over there! Sir! Do you want Fanta? I will give it to you for one euro. Come on! Let's find another spot, this is a waste of time. -Ok! -Yes? It was a good idea, though. It was a good idea. We tried it and... Next year when the hotel actually opens, there might also be some tourists! Ah, wait, you missed a spot! Up there! -Bruno, you pig! -No, you deserved it! You deserved it! Stop it, stop it! Why are you such pussies? Bruno? My card's not working... Can I use yours? Again? -Did you keep it next to your phone? -No, I didn't! I've tried it like eight times already! See! -Take mine for today! -Thanks! Wait, do you have a moment? I need to talk to you. Something got lost, you know? In one of the rooms. In one of my rooms? Exactly! That's why we need to check your locker... -What has my locker to do with it? -Let's just check it together. What's going on here? He thinks that I've stolen something. I am sorry, but there have been indications and you were the last one in there. May I take a look inside, please? -Now? -Yes, now! I think I don't have my key with me! That won't be a problem. I have a universal key here. Please, let me have a look. See? Nothing! If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look. -I have no idea, how this got in there! -You know what? I don't even care. Tomorrow you will hand out your keycard and uniform. -No! -Bruno, this is not about you. I will inform the reception. Until the end of this week, you're gone! That must have been a mistake, I'm sure it wasn't on purpose. Bruno, this is not about you. Just relax, okay? But it is you, I don't wanna see you here again. What's going on? Bruno? Better ask Toni. Did something happen? I was fired. Excuse me? -What happened? -I was fired! Ah, and why exactly? I forgot the wallet in my wardrobe. I thought you're smarter. He kicked her out. She has to move out of the resort next week. What? You have to move out? I can stay and keep my job, but she has to leave. You have to move out? Out of the bungalow? I have no clue! I can't afford the bungalow alone. It's just always the same shit. I'd like to talk to you for a second. -Do you want a drink? -No, thank you. Okay, Bruno. What do you want? Please give my mum her job back. She really needs the job... we need the job. I know she fucked up. But I promise it won't ever happen again. Listen, if you take my mom back, I am willing to work overtime, unpaid! I could drive the guests around when the season has started. You're missing the point here. It's not about that. What impression would the guests get? What will the team think? Just tell them it was a huge misunderstanding. I promise that this will never happen again. -Promise, right? -Yes! I took a closer look at you and your mother. You aren't new to the island. You have been living here for more than 12 years now and you have worked in over 9 hotels. I can work here, too. I can fix things and put your furniture together and repair stuff. Please give me a chance. I'll do anything! Is somebody here? No one's here. Toni, leave it alone. Stop this. Not my fault that it slipped in by itself. Toni, you need a job! I don't care what kind of job. Dish washer, housekeeping, barkeeper or whatever. You need a job but you just don't care. Do you have any idea where else we could ask? At the airport, maybe? We could ask for a job at the check-in counter. At the airport, yeah, sure. Have you ever seen someone like you working there? You screwed up. I can't pay everything by myself. I don't have that much money, okay? We depend on your income and what do you do? You screw everything up. And you take no responsibility! I don't know what else to do. I am trying to help you. It has just happened once. -That you have lost a job? Once? -No, that I was caught stealing. It's just not fair. I think it's outrageous, that you are now acting up like that and that you are cornering me like that. As if it was my fault. -It is your fault. Did I steal something? -Calm down! Did I steal? -Hey, hey calm! Don't talk to me like this. It doesn't work. We can't go on like this. Soon nobody will hire us anymore. Nowhere. What then? Bye! How was it? No, they have no open positions. What does that mean? They don't hire. But didn't you tell them, that you have lots of experience? Of course, I mean, they have my CV. I've shown them everything. Did you offer them to just work on standby? No, well, no I didn't ask about that. I don't get why you didn't try everything. You could have said much more. You could have offered to clean the rooms, work at the bar or step in as a waitress. Well, we had some communication issues. -Because of Spanish? -He didn't speak German, only Spanish. Bruno? Where are you going? I have to take care of something. What is it? My mother will get her job back and both of us will work for another season. After the season we'll be gone. But until then we stay. You really think you walk in here, drop your pants and your problem is solved? Ignore it. Stay here! -Hello? -Is my son here? No. Do you think I don't know what's going on in here? Leave my property! Are you doing this with all your employees? You piece of shit! Touch my son ever again and I will end you! Go away! Once more and I'll finish you. -I'll pack your things. -What is going on? What happened? You are bleeding! What are you doing, Toni? Are you fucking serious? Are you fucking serious? Why are you always destroying everything? Why? Why do I have to clean up your mess? Why do you always have to screw up? -You are so fucking selfish! -Me? I am selfish? I'm doing all this for us, for you and me! For us? You aren't doing anything for us. Nothing! Everything you do is for yourself You just want to have fun. You don't fucking care what I am doing. -Calm down. -That's how it is. I always clean up after her. I always try to do everything right, I try to pull you through and you just don't give a fuck. That's all your fault! Stop it! -Pack your things. -Stop it! Why can't you ever do anything for me? Bruno, come with me, I'll clean your wound. Well, everything's packed and ready. Tomorrow we'll be gone. The bleeding doesn't stop, we need to get him to a hospital. It's just a scratch. I have checked it before. No worries. Don't you get it? Your son is bleeding. The two of us got along very well before. She just wants to help. Alright then. I am sure it's just a scratch! It's going to heal. Toni, there's police out there. Open the door! Police! Police! Open the door! What can I do for you? I don't understand anything. I haven't done anything. I'm not going anywhere. Don't touch me. Bruno! Please call me back if you hear this. Hey! Zoe, what are you looking for? Do you have something to eat? Aren't your parents home? Let's see what we can find. What do you like? Pasta or sandwich? Pasta! Well then, pasta it is. What's wrong? Nothing. All good. You're not okay. I think I have to leave. Here we are. Okay bye. I will come and visit you. Promise? Of course. Take care, okay? Go to your room. Go, come on. Toni has a charge for assault. He deserved it. It was worth it. And we'll be gone soon anyway. How long do you wanna go on like this Toni? Why? We are happy like this. Aren't we, Bruno? We are happy, aren't we? Well, so only the two of us are leaving. Only us. It's all good.
