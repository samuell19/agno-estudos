- The preparations are thus completed. Let our work begin. Bring to me the vessel of reversal. My child, lay you down upon this altar. Thus we begin, and in reunion will we end. By this token we the portals of the unhallowed plain have torn apart and thrown aside. The fire of torment is ablaze, the heat is scorching, the life is coming back. Oh, great guardian on your throne of gold, I bid you, stand back and let her return to us in all her glory. " No! - I thee invoke oh, prince of light and darkness. At the dying of the flame, enter into the body of this lowly vessel, that she may be made worthy to receive the soul of thy most illustrious daughter. Return to us. We await you, oh, beloved of the old faith. Seek out this vessel we offer you, seek her out and return. This is my will, and my will shall be obeyed. Hey. Might as well finish it off. Finish me off, you mean. Don't look at me like that. I know you're tying to get me drunk. - Now why would I want to do that? - For the same reason you lured me to your county retreat in the first place. - I just thought you might enjoy it. - Just between you and me, I have. All these old things. There's nothing like this back home. At least, not where I come from. My folks would go crazy for all this. I did it again, didn't I? Why do I have to keep mentioning them? You must miss them, I suppose. But I don't. I wanted to get away from them. That's why I came to England, to get away. I just wanted to pack my things and leave without telling anyone where I was going. And now you're here. - I guess the novelty must be wearing off. I suppose I'll have to go back sometime. You don't have to go. - Hey, I didn't realize it was so late. - I dare say we could find you somewhere to sleep. Oh, you dare say, do you? Well, I dare say I'd be very grateful. Where's the light? Don't you feel kind of creepy, stuck out here? No. English reserve strikes again. Ooh, that wine. You're like an animal! You're insane! Get out of here. Go on. Get out! What time is it? Early. Where you going? Home. You said it was early. - I told you, we're leaving at 10. Oh. You're not really going on that trip ar you? - How many more times must I tell you? Yes. What a waste of time. Traveling 200 miles to be bored out of your mind. It's not 200 miles. It's no more than 60. And how do you know I'll be bored out of my mind? - Well spending a week with an uncle you've never even met. It's gotta be a bore. Why? I happen to like meeting new people. Just because you're content to lie around in bed all day. - All right, you've made your point. So I know why you're going. You've been hearing those voices again haven't you? They're not voices. They're premonitions. I wish I'd never told you about them. Lot of old rubbish, anyway. Well, I don't think so. But I don't expect you to understand. As a matter of fact, I have had a strange feeling about this trip. It's one of the main reasons I've decided to go. - I suppose you realize you'll be away for your birthday? Yes. Why? Oh, nothing. I was gonna take you out for a meal, that's all. It doesn't matter. Oh, John, I'm sorry. Let's leave it until I get back. I might survive that long. It's only a week. I have to get back to start my new job anyway. - Wait just a minute, I've got something for you. Here. Happy birthday. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it. Oh, John, it's beautiful. It was my mother's. It's lovely, but I can't. Yes, you can. There. Thank you. I've got to go. - Aren't you gonna thank me properly? Hello! Hello. Sorry I'm late. - We thought you might have changed your mind about coming with us. I couldn't catch a bus. Hello, Mom. Oh, there you are. You might have told us you were gonna stay out all night. Forgot, sorry. - It's not as if we knew where you were. - We had a pretty shrewd idea though. Look. Oh Catherine, it's lovely. - It's my birthday present from John. Look Malcolm, isn't it lovely? Very nice. That must have set him back a bob or two. Actually, it was his mother's. Well isn't that sweet? He must think a lot of you. I think he does. I'd better go and get changed. - You'll have to let us meet him sometime. I do hope the weather holds out for us this week. I'd hate to be snowbound in the county. - I don't think there's much chance of that. Anyway, we may not stay a week. Why shouldn't we stay? I don't know. It's just that... Well, you might not get on with Alexander. Or I might not get on with him come to that. We haven't seen each other since we were kids remember? - I didn't even know you had a brother. I'm not surprised. Quite honestly, I think he's got a bit of a cheek. I mean demanding that we go and stay with him after all this time. He didn't demand. Well, you know what I mean. - He's probably lonely, that's all. Why should he be lonely? - Well I told you, his wife died. - I didn't know it was this remote. Here, let me see the map. Well, it must be down one of these roads. Let's try the left hand one. That could be it up ahead. What is it, Malcolm? My head. Oh, my God, look out! Mom? She's all right, isn't she? Yes, she'll be all right. How about you? I'm fine. Just a few bruises, I think. I'd better get some help. - No, you stay here with Mom, I'll go. Tell them to get an ambulance. Come away. No, let me go! Alexander, come and help me! I can't control her! Come on. - Let me go! - Stephen, the fire extinguishers! Feeling a little better? Yes, thank you. Good. These tablets are only sedatives. They're quite harmless, but they will make you sleep. Is the room ready? Yes. Good. Now then, come along, young lady. UP YOU get. And off you go to bed. I'll be along in a moment to make sure you're comfortable. What is it, Stephen? There was nothing I could do. I'm terribly sorry. You must phone the police. Off to sleep, my dear. We'll look after you. There we are. Who are you? - I'm Francis, your uncle's secretary. Comfortable? Yes, thank you. You must sleep. Plenty of rest is what I prescribe. Did Malcolm... Did your father ever tell you that I was a doctor? It's at moments like this that I'm glad that I am. Sleep now. We'll talk tomorrow. And remember, if you want anything I'll be downstairs. Hello. I haven't seen much of you recently. No, you haven't, have you? Ooh. Is that all I get? No. I have things to do. - Can't you spare me just a few minutes of your, valuable time? - I must go and check on Catherine. She's asleep. She'll be asleep all night. - Maybe, but I still want to see how she is. Look! Leave her alone! Stay here with me. She's my cousin. I have to go and see her. And I want you here, damn you! I love you, Stephen. What do you want me to do, hm? - I don't want you to do anything, Francis! You bastard! Keep quiet! Let go of me. Let go! You're hurting my arm! - I will let go of you when you shut up. Shut up! What's the matter? You're afraid your cousin might hear? You... Mom? Good morning, Catherine. I've brought you your breakfast. I thought you were... You've been dreaming. Don't upset yourself. I'll fetch your uncle. Alexander. What is it, Catherine? Are you all right? She had a dream. She thought I was- Thank you, Francis. That Will be all. It's inevitable that you should be suffering from shock. And shock can affect you in many ways. You understand that, don't you, my dear? There's no instant cure. It'd be very wrong for me to suggest that there was. But time heals, believe me, that's true. So I want you to stay here for as long as you need to. And look on me not only as your uncle but as your friend and your doctor who wants to help you all he can. Thank you. - There's no reason for you to rush back to London is there? No, I don't think so. Good. Then we'll have plenty of time to get to know each other. I'll be downstairs when you're ready to get up. Everything seems, so unreal. Like a dream. That's what everybody says, isn't it? But it's just that I, I can't accept the truth. I can't accept the fact that I saw the car blow up in front of my eyes. Why did it blow up? That sort of thing doesn't just happen. I, too, found it incredible. The police say that Malcolm... That your father must have left the ignition on. This ignited the petrol, which exploded. But why us? Why did it have to happen to us? - You echo my very thoughts when my wife died. "Why us" I asked. She was so very young. But we are all mortal. Catherine, I know this is a painful time for you, but the police would like to ask you a few questions. Oh, no. Never mind. We'll keep them waiting a few days. Yes, all right. Oh, one other thing Catherine. We didn't see any reason for delaying the funeral so we decided to hold the service in our private burial ground this afternoon. You'd like to be there? Don't worry, I understand. Think about it. You've time to think. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. - It's all right, it's just that I didn't see you there. Nor did I. I mean I hadn't realized you were up yet. - I didn't feel like staying in bed any longer. There didn't seem to be any point. No, of course not. This is a beautiful house. You must be very rich. No, not really. At least, not since father gave up the practice. - How does he manage to keep up all this? - Oh, he gets money here and there. Friends. I don't really know. Wish I had friends like that. - Would you like a look around the grounds? What, now? I don't know. The air will do you good. I'm sure Father would agree. - Well all right, but I haven't got a coat. - Oh that's alright, Francis will lend you one of hers. I'll get her while you're dressing. What happened to the car? The police took it. Now come along, you wanted to see the grounds. - It's difficult to know what to say to relatives you never knew you had. Why? - Well, I feel we know each other and yet we don't, if you see what I mean. I know a lot about you. Do you? Yes, my father used to tell me all about you when we lived in Africa. He was always going on and on about his brother and how he'd been given the daughter that my father should have had. He doesn't like me much, you see. Always wanted a daughter. But there was no chance of having any more children, so he got stuck with me. Because your mother died? Yes. - Your father said she was very young. She was 29. That's terrible. I am sorry, I didn't mean- - No, it's all right, it was a long time ago. Was it an accident? Yes, that's what it was. It was an accident. This is our enchanted forest. They wanted to sell it but they couldn't. It's protected or something. Because of what happened here. What was that? Oh, of course! You wouldn't know, would you? Some people are sensitive to their surroundings than others, aren't they? Are they? Yes. It's hereditary. An ability to pick up certain vibrations. I sometimes have premonitions. Do they come true? What's the matter? Nothing. It's just that it's getting rather cold. I think I would like to go back now. - Don't you want to know what happened here? No. Catherine. No. Catherine. No. Stephen? Stephen! Stephen! You've been a long time. What is it out there? I'm sorry, I'm not with you. - Why did you leave me on my own? - I thought you were following me, but then I looked around and you'd gone. No. You walked off and left me. - But I didn't leave you, Catherine. You were cold. You wanted to come back to the house. Don't you remember? But I saw something. I saw the car explode. That was yesterday. No, today. Just now. No, Catherine. But I saw it, Stephen. Out there. But it wasn't my parents who were burning, it was me. Look, it's all right. You're probably still in shock. It sometimes happens like this. Father has explained it all to me, how these things sometimes can play tricks on the mind. But it seemed so real. And the voices, you must have heard them. Just the wind. I've never been so frightened. - For as much as it hath pleased almighty God to take unto Himself the souls of our dear brother and sister here departed, we therefore commit their bodies to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen. Do you mind if I join you? No, of course not. - You wouldn't prefer to be alone? No, I'd like you to stay. - That boy's a complete mystery to me. One moment, I fear for his sanity and the next, butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. Remarkable what a pretty face can achieve, isn't it? - I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him. Very wise, my dear. Very wise indeed. Hello? Yes. Excellent, I'm glad to say. You know that's not possible. Because I say so. You must allow me to be the judge of that. No. No chance whatsoever. I'm afraid it's impossible. We must keep to the plan, as arranged. I can assure you, nothing will change my mind. Yes. Yes, you will. Goodbye. - We will not talk about it later, we will talk about it now. I won't let you do this to me, Stephen. - Look, I've explained it nicely, what more do you want? - Oh I've never wanted anything from you. Not much, you haven't. All I've wanted, all I've ever wanted since you took me into your bed and lied to me, is for you to be nice to me. To be around occasionally. I don't care what you do with your life, what girls you pick up, what you do with them, but I won't be rejected for good. I won't! Especially not for her, Stephen. Not for her. - Well, it's too bad, isn't it, Francis? Because it's over. Do you understand? Over. Finished! Catherine. We'd better go, hadn't we? Yes. - Well here's to affairs gone by. Ouch. Abbadon. Apollyon. Asmodeus. Moloch. Timbon. Satan. " Oh! It's blood! It's only wine. Here, let me. What's the matter, Catherine? What is it? I don't know. I felt so frightened. You're probably still upset. No, it's more than that. Please, take me back. How are you feeling now? A little better. We'll soon be home. What the... What happened? Nothing's happened. Catherine just isn't feeling very well. Catherine, your skirt. Are you all right? I Will be. It was an accident. I just want to rest. Yes, of course. I didn't do anything. It was an accident. Some wine got spilled. It wasn't Stephen's fault. - He should not have allowed it to happen. I shall talk to you later, Stephen. Come, I'll take you to your room. You seem to be running a temperature. But why? I was only sitting in the car. Shock, my dear. What's happening to me? Nothing you need worry about. Here, take these. What are they? It's only a sedative. Like the ones you had before. You're going to have another sound night's sleep and then we'll start again from scratch tomorrow. - But my skirt, I wanted to take it off. - It's not important. But the wine- Francis will take care of it. Everything will be all right. Delirious. Becoming delirious. Catherine? Oh, thank God. It's all right, I'm here now. I heard you cry out. I've had a dream. A nightmare. Oh, but it seemed so... Real? - So many things have been playing on my mind. The accident. This house. The talk about witches. Your father keeps telling me it's shock, I know, but... Oh, I don't know. We don't mean to frighten you. I know that. - You're not frightened of me, are you? Not right now. That's good. I wouldn't like to think that I have frightened you. Catherine! Hello. - You'll catch cold, out here so early. No, I won't. I feel marvelous today. - Any particular reason? Yes. There is a reason. " Oh? And what might that be? You. " Me? What have I done? Made me fall in love with you. - The thing I admire most about you, Francis, is your ability to suffer in silence. Don't ever change. Is the pleasure of Stephen worth the pain? When can we go? I don't know. Soon? - But it's rather difficult you see. Why? Father. - I don't want him to think I'm ungrateful. He's been so kind to me. You all have. But it's just that I'm better now. I know I am. And this house, holds too many memories for me. I'm sure I'd feel happier if I went away. - Yes, I do understand what you mean. - And so will your father, I'm sure of it. - Well he may not have much feeling for me, but I'm the only family he's got. - He won't mind you going away with me will he? It's not as if he's never going to see you again. I shall have to ask him. I knew you would. Come on. I suppose I ought to phone John and let him know. It's only fair. - Why don't you wait until London before you do that. - I'm a coward, that's the trouble. There's a phone in the hall, isn't there? ' Yes. Well? She wants to leave. This wouldn't have happened if you'd followed my instructions. - Well, what are we going to do? You've done enough already. Yes? Is John there, please? - John's gone away for a few days, I'm afraid. Where to? Oh, he didn't say. - I'm sorry, who am I speaking to? - Well, he'll be back again on Wednesday, if you'd like to try then. Yes, okay, I'll do that. Who shall I say called? Catherine. Righty-O then. Bye, love. - Another of my son's mistakes rectified. What other blunders have you made, Stephen? What else have we got to clear up after you? What else did he tell her? - Well what did you say, Stephen? Come on, what did you say? I said we'd go away together. I see. And did you mean it? No. - Anyway, it doesn't matter does it? - Very soon you'll realize just how much it matters. Tomorrow is Catherine's birthday, we must complete the arrangements. Go and talk to her. Keep her out of harm's way. If you've ruined my plans, Stephen, I'll kill you. I can promise you that. Hello. I'm looking for my bracelet. I can't seem to find it anywhere. You won't find it. Why? Do you know where it is? It's been taken. Taken? Who would want to take it? Come with me and I'll explain. Camilla Yorke. She's to blame, Catherine, for everything. She is the reason you're being kept a prisoner in this house. A prisoner? I'd hardly call myself a prisoner. - Oh you may not realize it but you are, and have been ever since you came to this house. Have you ever heard of necromancy? _ vaguely. The art of raising the dead. Alexander and Stephen have very great interest in it. Who are they tying to raise? Camilla. You're crazy. - Listen to what I have to say first and then laugh if you want to. Camilla was known to have incredible powers. And ever since he was a boy Alexander has dreamt of bringing her back to life. Of using her powers for himself and of making her high priestess of his coven. His coven? Yes. After many attempts he discovered that the only satisfactory way to resurrect the dead is through the body of a direct descendant. You don't mean me? - Catherine, you are a direct descendant of Camilla York. So confident of his knowledge, Alexander sacrificed the life of his own wife but the experiment failed. So sure of success, he allowed Stephen, who was no more than a child to watch the ceremony, and the murder of his own mother. An experience which affected his mind for the rest of his life. But that's horrible. It can't be true. There is more proof, if you still don't believe me. That's Camilla. - Why have they been playing this trick with me? Why didn't they do something when I first arrived? - They had to wait for the right time, your 20th birthday. That's tomorrow! That's why you must leave. We both must. The main road's not far from here and we can be miles away by morning. But why can't we leave now? Or phone the police? Oh, no one makes phone calls that Alexander doesn't know about. But I did, to John. He didn't try to stop me. No, Catherine, John is dead. Alexander killed him. That's why he needed your bracelet, to reach John. But I spoke to somebody. Catherine, it was me. Oh, I am sorry, but I had to tell you this. We'll meet in the kitchen tonight, okay? - You seem very interested in the time. - No, it's just that I'm rather tired. I think I'll go up to bed. What a sensible girl. - I can hardly keep my eyes open. - Don't you want dessert? - Francis will bring you up some hot milk. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Don't forget, tomorrow's your special day. Goodnight. You're supposed to be tired. I'm glad you're not. Please, don't. What's wrong? I just don't want you to. - I spoke to Father about our going away together. Don't you want to hear what he said? Tell me tomorrow. I don't understand you. At first you say you want to leave as soon as possible, and now you're not even interested. I am interested. It's just that I'm tired. - You didn't seem tired when I came in. Has anything happened to make you change your mind? No. I just want to go to sleep. Do you really? That's what I said. Stephen! Have you come to try and get 'round me? Well you know me always ready to forgive and forget. You know I couldn't love anybody as much as I do you. I had to take them. Stephen, he was blackmailing me. I wasn't going to show them to anybody, I wasn't going to tell anybody! Let me keep them, please! Francis? It's taken a long time, but now you belong to us. Your time has come, Catherine. You are 20 years old, the age at which Camilla departed from this earth. You deserve to be told something about our sacred lady before you give your soul up for her. There's no need. Then we can proceed. The ritual burning. Take her. Stephen. Stephen, don't, please! Bring her! Please! No! Get her! Get her back! Catherine! Catherine, what's the matter with you? Oh, no, it can't be! Can't be what? What do you mean? - You're not my father, he's dead! - We'd better get you back in the house. - No, he's dead, he was burnt alive! Let me go! Oh! I'm sorry. But look at me. I am your father. Oh, God. Think! You know I am. I'm going mad! Catherine, listen to me. Do you know where you are? Yes. Uncle- - Uncle Alexander's, that's right. He's trying to kill me. To kill you? Now, now, slowly now. Do you remember how we got here? Yes, by car. But it crashed! Yes. It burst into flames. You were burnt alive! - Catherine, only you were injured. You hit your head. You were delirious, we took you into the house and Uncle Alexander gave you a sedative. He's a doctor. I told you on the way here, remember? Yes. He is a doctor, isn't he? Now it's coming back, you see? - I'm not sure, I just don't know. You've had a very long sleep, and you must have had a very bad dream. A dream? I can't believe it. It all seemed so clear. The black magic, the... What do you mean, a very long sleep? It's true, you have. When did we arrive here? Yesterday afternoon. But I've been here... It seems as if I've been here for days. - Let's go in and find out how you got into such a mess. People. They were chasing me. What people? Where? Let's go in and find your mother. Good God! - She must have been sleepwalking. Look at the state you're in! Exactly. - My poor child, come to the fire, you must be frozen. - I've only been out of the house for half an hour. - You should've been sleeping soundly. If only I'd known. Where's Elizabeth? Upstairs, I think. You sure I can't get you something? A hot drink? Brandy? No, thank you. Are you all right now? I'll go and fetch your mother. I won't be long. You'll be all right here, won't you? Yes. You're sure? You're absolutely sure? Well then, what happened? I was running. I must have run through the woods. I don't know why. I'm sorry, I'm not very clear at the moment. I'm not surprised. You've had a rather powerful drug inside you, it induces a very deep sleep indeed. Two small tablets. Did you give them to me? Yes. I remember that. I think it's beginning to come back. You see, I've had an extraordinary dream. It was about you and this house. Tell me about it. No, it's too silly to repeat. What happened to my father? - He's gone to fetch your mother. I'm afraid he'll want you all to leave, he's very upset. I think I'd like to leave. I'm sorry, but that must sound terrible. It's just that I was convinced I'd never go home again. - And now you'd like to go and make sure it's still there? Yes. Actually, I think it's my boyfriend I miss most. I'd like to reassure myself that he's still there. I understand. Why don't you telephone him and let him know you're coming? May I? Of course. Use the phone over there. Behind the curtain. Here? Yes. Vicious, isn't it? Right through the eye and into the brain. Good heavens, you must have a streak of Camilla in you.
